(U) CLASSIFIED BY DAN MOZENA, ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR. </p><p>REASONS:  1.5 (C) (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, HAMED GAILANI, THE </p><p>POLITICALLY-ACTIVE SON OF PIR GAILANI, AND MULLAH MALANG, AN AFGHAN </p><p>WITH LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY THAT "RADICALS" ARE </p><p>GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN THE TALIBAN.  THEY PICTURE THE "RADICALS" </p><p>AS BEING STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE TALIBAN\'S POLICY OF OFFERING SAFE </p><p>HAVEN TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN.  THEY ADDED THAT SOME </p><p>OF THE "RADICALS," INCLUDING "JUSTICE MINISTER" TURABI AND HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL TALIBAN ADVISER WAKIL AHMED, WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>CLOSE TO MULLAH MANSOUR, A STRONGLY ISLAMIST RESISTANCE LEADER, WHO </p><p>WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1992.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>"RADICALS" SEEN AS GAINING THE UPPER HAND </p><p>-----------------------------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN AN APRIL 12 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, HAMED GAILANI, </p><p>THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, SAID HE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF "RADICALS" </p><p>HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  IN A </p><p>SEPARATE APRIL 14 CONVERSATION, MULLAH MALANG, A COMMANDER IN THE </p><p>AFGHAN RESISTANCE WITH CLOSE LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>HE HAD ALSO NOTED A "MORE EXTREME EDGE" TO THE TALIBAN, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN THE PAST MONTH.  BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG LISTED THE FOLLOWING </p><p>TALIBAN LEADERS AS "RADICALS" WITH INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN THE </p><p>MOVEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>-- MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ADVISER TO TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR. </p><p>-- MULLAH TURABI, THE "JUSTICE MINISTER." </p><p>-- MULLAH MUTAQI, THE "INFORMATION MINISTER." </p><p>-- MULLAH JALIL, THE "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER" IN KANDAHAR. </p><p>-- SHER MOHAMMAD STANEKZAI, THE "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER" IN KABUL. </p><p>-- MULLAH SIDDIQI, THE "ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE."  (NOTE:  SEE REF B </p><p>FOR RECORD OF POLOFF\'S RECENT MEETING WITH SIDDIQI, IN KABUL.) </p><p> </p><p>STRONG PRO-BIN LADEN VIEWS </p><p>--------------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT ALL OF THESE TALIBAN OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE TALIBAN\'S POLICY OF PROVIDING SAFE HAVEN </p><p>AND PROTECTION TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN.  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HE NOTED, TURABI, WAKIL AHMED AND MUTAQI HAVE BEEN </p><p>IDENTIFIED WITH THE PRO-BIN LADEN WING OF THE TALIBAN.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, MALANG CONTINUED, ALTHOUGH MULLAH RABBANI, THE TALIBAN </p><p>"CHIEF OF THE CARETAKER COUNCIL," AND MULLAH GHAUS, THE TALIBAN </p><p>"FOREIGN MINISTER," ARE NOT AGAINST OFFERING HAVEN TO BIN LADEN, </p><p>THEY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE TALIBAN OF BEING IDENTIFIED WITH BIN LADEN\'S </p><p>ANTI-SAUDI AND ANTI-AMERICAN POLICIES.  HOWEVER, MALANG ADDED, </p><p>RABBANI AND GHAUS HAVE "LOST THE ARGUMENT" AND THE TALIBAN HAVE NO </p><p>PLANS TO ADJUST THEIR POLICY ON BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED WHY BIN LADEN IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE "RADICALS," </p><p>MALANG REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>RADICALS SEE BIN LADEN AS A "LEARNED MUSLIM," WHO CAN QUOTE FROM </p><p>THE KORAN AND HADITHS (SAYINGS OF THE PROPHET).  IN ADDITION, THEY </p><p>FEEL HE IS OWED RESPECT BECAUSE HE HELPED THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE </p><p>DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  FINALLY, MALANG OBSERVED, THE </p><p>"RADICALS" ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDS THAT BIN LADEN PROVIDES </p><p>THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE "MANSOUR" GROUP </p><p>-------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ASSERTED THAT MOST OF THE TALIBAN </p><p>"RADICALS" WERE AFFILIATED WITH AN AFGHAN RESISTANCE PARTY LED BY </p><p>NASRULLAH MANSOUR.  GAILANI TOLD POLOFF THAT MANSOUR WAS ORIGINALLY </p><p>THE DEPUTY TO MOHAMMED NABI MOHAMMEDI, THE LEADER OF HARAKAT-I- </p><p>INQILAB-I-ISLAMI (HII), BUT LEFT THE PARTY TO FORM A BREAKAWAY </p><p>FACTION IN 1981.  THE ISSUE THAT LED TO THE HII SPLIT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>GAILANI, WAS NABI\'S BELIEF THAT MANSOUR HAD GROWN "TOO </p><p>INTERNATIONALIST" IN HIS ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  HE NOTED THAT MANSOUR </p><p>WAS ASSASSINATED BY UNITS LOYAL TO HEZB-I-ISLAMI (HEKMATYAR) IN </p><p>1992, AND ADDED THAT WAKIL AHMED, TURABI, AND SIDDIQI, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, ARE CONSIDERED "PROTEGES OF MANSOUR." </p><p> </p><p>"MANSOURIS" SEEN AS LESS ANTI-IRANIAN" </p><p>--------------------------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) NOTING THAT MANSOUR SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN IRAN IN THE </p><p>1980S, MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED </p><p>"MANSOURIS" (AS SUPPORTERS OF MANSOUR ARE KNOWN) ARE CONSIDERED TO </p><p>BE LESS ANTI-IRANIAN THAN OTHER TALIBAN.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, </p><p>HE EXPLAINED THAT SINCE "MANSOURIS" ARE MORE ISLAMIST IN </p><p>ORIENTATION AND LESS NATIONALISTIC, THEY DO NOT HOLD THE STRONG </p><p>ANTI-IRANIAN BELIEFS COMMON TO OTHER AFGHANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE </p><p>PASHTUNS FROM WESTERN PROVINCES LIKE KANDAHAR, HELMAND, URUZGAN, </p><p>AND FARAH.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE PRO-IRANIAN, HE CONCLUDED, </p><p>BUT SIMPLY THAT "MANSOURIS" ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO THE </p><p>IRANIANS. </p><p> </p><p>A TALIBAN "REFORM COMMISSION" </p><p>-----------------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) NEITHER GAILANI NOR MALANG BELIEVED THAT THE TREND TOWARD </p><p>WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE "RADICALIZATION" OF THE TALIBAN WOULD EBB </p><p>IN THE NEAR-TERM.  BOTH NOTED THAT THAT THEY HAD HEARD THAT MULLAH </p><p>TURABI WAS NAMED THE HEAD OF A "REFORM COMMISSION" BY TALIBAN </p><p>LEADER MULLAH OMAR IN MARCH.  FROM THIS POSITION, MALANG COMMENTED, </p><p>IT IS BELIEVED THAT MULLAH TURABI NOW MAINTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>INFLUENCE ON PERSONNEL DECISIONS AND DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, SINCE IT WAS REPORTED THAT TURABI WAS CHOSEN FOR THE POST </p><p>PERSONALLY BY MULLAH OMAR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE IS NOW, ALONG </p><p>WITH MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ONE OF OMAR\'S CLOSEST ADVISERS, HE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------/ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ARE KNOWLEGEABLE CONTACTS ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN; MALANG, IN PARTICULAR, APPEARS TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT </p><p>TALIBAN PERSONALITIES AND DECISION-MAKING.  THEIR ASSERTION THAT </p><p>"RADICALS" IN THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN GAINING INFLUENCE HAS BEEN </p><p>REPEATED BY OTHER OBSERVERS, INCLUDING GENERAL PAYENDA, DOSTAM\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN PAKISTAN (REF A).  BIN LADEN\'S ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>THE PURPORTEDLY ASCENDANT "RADICALS" IS POTENTIALLY OF GREAT </p><p>CONCERN, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS THAT BIN LADEN IS ABLE TO EXPAND </p><p>HIS INFLUENCE ON THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
