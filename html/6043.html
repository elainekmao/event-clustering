<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001210 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS SABA GHORI, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, ELAB, KDEM, KSEP, XE, XF, XM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY AMMAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 13796 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Per reftel, Post is providing the following report on </p><p>actions taken by the USG in Jordan during 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Introduction </p><p> </p><p>Our human rights strategy in Jordan seeks to promote human </p><p>rights through a) direct dialogue with the Jordanian </p><p>Government and others, b) programs aimed at fostering </p><p>elements of human rights, and c) reporting on human rights </p><p>activity in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>A.   Dialogue with the Jordanian Government and others </p><p> </p><p>      The US Embassy in Amman promotes human rights, </p><p>democracy and the rule of law with the Jordanian Government </p><p>on a regular basis.  We have a strong, multi-faceted </p><p>relationship with Jordan, and human rights issues are an </p><p>essential component.  Our frank dialogue with the Government </p><p>has yielded progress.  Partly in response to the Embassy\'s </p><p>frequent approaches on human rights issues, the Government </p><p>announced in late 2002 the creation of a new Human Rights </p><p>Directorate within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and is </p><p>planning to train diplomats at U.S. institutions of higher </p><p>education during 2003.  Aside from the new Directorate, the </p><p>Government in January 2003 announced a forthcoming Human </p><p>Rights Commission, which the Government has indicated will be </p><p>independent and have regulatory authority. </p><p> </p><p>      Aside from the Jordanian Government, we also meet </p><p>regularly with local NGOS, UN officials and human rights </p><p>officers of European nations, Canada and the European Council. </p><p> </p><p>      On labor issues we maintain an ongoing dialogue with </p><p>key actors in the labor sector, including the GOJ, labor </p><p>union leaders, International Labor Organization (ILO) </p><p>officials, industrial park managers and factory owners.  A </p><p>primary focus is the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs), in </p><p>which we encourage all parties to maintain acceptable labor </p><p>standards for Jordan\'s growing textile industry.  We note </p><p>that in 2002, labor conditions in the QIZs were generally </p><p>good with a trend toward improvement. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Embassy Programs </p><p> </p><p>i.  Public Diplomacy Programs </p><p> </p><p>      The Embassy funds programs to promote human rights </p><p>through the Public Diplomacy Section, the cumulative value of </p><p>which exceeded 100,000 USD in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Ongoing judicial reform projects involve a visitors exchange </p><p>program for judges and judicial experts.  Judicial reform is </p><p>particularly important as Jordan is now a member of the WTO </p><p>and enjoys a free trade agreement with the United States.  We </p><p>also fund English language training of Jordanian judges to </p><p>broaden the range of information and contacts available to </p><p>them.  We fund an ongoing series of visits and locally based </p><p>training programs for Jordanian journalists and editors, and </p><p>translate "best practices" materials for journalists.  In the </p><p>area of Women and Democracy, we fund projects for women\'s </p><p>advocacy, training of female candidates to run for elected </p><p>office, and training staff and volunteers for such campaigns. </p><p> We plan to continue our training program for women through </p><p>the forthcoming parliamentary elections of 2003.  Finally, in </p><p>the area of civic education, we are supporting the </p><p>translation of a civic education textbook that the Ministry </p><p>of Education plans to use in an upcoming pilot project in </p><p>Jordanian schools. </p><p> </p><p>In October the Post sponsored a conference for civic </p><p>education activists from a dozen Arab countries, including </p><p>Jordan, who have founded "Arab Civitas", an NGO aimed at </p><p>strengthening civic education in schools and universities </p><p>throughout the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>Public Affairs and USAID plan on signing a PASA agreement </p><p>funding human rights and democracy activities in coordination </p><p>with an interagency committee at Post. </p><p> </p><p>ii.  USAID Programs </p><p> </p><p>USAID programs address human rights issues by promoting a </p><p>transparent, efficient and responsive public sector through </p><p>good governance, legal reform, and improvement of civic </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p>The good governance program, at work throughout Jordan, is </p><p>aimed at improving the ability of Jordanians to influence </p><p>public policy.  The program focuses on, among other things, </p><p>establishing E-government and judicial reform.  The budget </p><p>for good governance programs in 2002 exceeded 4 million USD. </p><p>USAID programs work to increase the advocacy ability of </p><p>business associations and NGOs.  USAID provides technical </p><p>assistance to private sector and civil society, (focusing in </p><p>large part on women\'s business groups and organizations) </p><p>which seek to participate in public policy making.  The 2002 </p><p>budget for these programs was approximately 400,000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout its 2002 programs USAID supported women in areas </p><p>such as economic participation (1,000,000 USD), access to </p><p>health care (12,000,000 USD) and poverty alleviation </p><p>(1,300,000 USD). </p><p>C.  Human Rights Reporting </p><p> </p><p>      In addition to the annual Human Rights Report and </p><p>International Religious Freedom Report, the Embassy regularly </p><p>reports human rights developments via the political and </p><p>public diplomacy sections.  During the year, we reported on </p><p>developments in specific cases, such as Toujan Faisal\'s </p><p>conviction in the State Security Court and subsequent pardon, </p><p>and general developments in areas such as honor killings and </p><p>improved labor conditions at the Qualifying Industrial Zones. </p><p> For more information on these and other cases, please see </p><p>our annual Human Rights Report. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
