(U) Summary:  While the Government of Nepal explored </p><p>opportunities for peace talks this week, Maoist attacks on </p><p>passenger buses, schools and other non-military targets </p><p>continued to kill and injure civilians.  Violence and </p><p>extortion prompted hundreds of additional Nepalis to join </p><p>the thousands already displaced internally, and tens of </p><p>thousands are reported to be fleeing to India.  Maoists </p><p>destroyed conservation research facilities in the Annapurna </p><p>region, and the World Bank called off several development </p><p>projects in Midwestern Nepal.  An American citizen received </p><p>an extortion letter.  Political parties and NGOs denounced </p><p>the Maoist-called educational strike and continuing </p><p>violence against civilians, while human rights </p><p>organizations criticized the army for the death of several </p><p>minors. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>GON IN TOUCH WITH MAOISTS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Saying that "security matters need not be </p><p>transparent to the public," Home Minister Dharma Bahadur </p><p>Thapa told reporters that his government is in touch with </p><p>the Maoist insurgents through a group of human rights </p><p>activists, and is exploring the opportunity for official </p><p>talks.  The minister called upon the insurgents to inform </p><p>the government of their agenda and to come to the </p><p>negotiation table. </p><p> </p><p>PASSENGER BUSES UNDER ATTACK; </p><p>MAOIST INCIDENTS INCREASE IN UPADAYA </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) At least five people were killed and 30 others </p><p>injured in a December 8 landmine attack on a passenger bus </p><p>in eastern Sindhuli district.  The front of the bus was </p><p>completely destroyed in the attack, which killed three </p><p>civilians and two members of the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Charging that buses have been carrying security </p><p>personnel, Maoists reportedly have stopped all public </p><p>transportation on two sections of highway in central </p><p>Nuwakot and Makwanpur districts, forcing local residents to </p><p>walk for several hours in order to sell produce at the </p><p>nearest markets.  In western Surkhet district, Maoists have </p><p>threatened to start collecting "donations" of 25,00O Nrs </p><p>(320 USD) from all buses traveling from the district </p><p>capital of Birendranagar. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) One passenger died and six were injured on December </p><p>11, when Maoists opened fire on a moving passenger bus </p><p>traveling through southern Udayapur district to Biratnagar. </p><p>The southern district has been experiencing increased </p><p>Maoist activity since last week\'s attack in neighboring </p><p>Siraha district (ref A).  Vehicular traffic came to a </p><p>standstill on the district\'s highway on November 11 when </p><p>Maoists destroyed a 15-meter long bridge, and villagers in </p><p>the area reported that the insurgents have been setting up </p><p>ambushes and burning vehicles along the road since December </p><p>8.  On December 9, Maoists looted seven houses in two </p><p>villages, taking cash, silver and gold, saying that they </p><p>were responsible for the Siraha attack. </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST SCHOOLS, CIV </p><p>ILIANS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On December 7, Maoists threw a socket bomb into the </p><p>compound of the Peace Zone Secondary School in southeastern </p><p>Sunsari district, destroying two buses and injuring a 14 </p><p>year-old student.  On December 8, in northeastern Terhathum </p><p>district, an eight year-old boy was killed and his sister </p><p>was injured by a Maoist bomb planted in the field where </p><p>they were herding family livestock. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On December 10, Maoists set fire to one school and </p><p>beat the headmaster of another in western Kailali district. </p><p>Two buses were destroyed by petrol bombs at a school in </p><p>Biratnagar, southern Morang district, on the same day. </p><p>Though classes were in session at the school when Maoists </p><p>threw the bombs into the compound, no students were injured </p><p>in the attack. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Eleven civilians were injured on December 7 when </p><p>Maoist rebels detonated a pressure cooker bomb in Lalitpur, </p><p>three kilometers south of Kathmandu\'s Ring Road.  The local </p><p>committee of the Maoist-affiliated All-Nepal National </p><p>Independent Student Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) has </p><p>claimed responsibility, and has called for other Lalitpur </p><p>restaurants to shut down. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS TERRORIZE MARKETS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) In Mangalbare bazaar in eastern Ilam district, 30-35 </p><p>insurgents cordoned off the market for nearly four hours on </p><p>the afternoon of December 7, and collected a "donation" of </p><p>over 50O,O00 Nrs (6400 USD) from local merchants.  One </p><p>merchant who opposed the Maoists was severely beaten, and </p><p>most of the shopkeepers have fled to the district </p><p>headquarters as a result of the daylight raid. </p><p>10. (U) Businesses in Sangutar, central Ramechhap district, </p><p>have been closed for one week in response to Maoist </p><p>threats.  According to press reports, the local insurgents </p><p>instructed businessmen to abandon their shops and leave the </p><p>village.  Pharmacies and other shops have closed, and </p><p>residents have been unable to purchase medicine or other </p><p>essential items.  Villagers are surviving on unprocessed </p><p>grain, since the local food mill has also been shut down by </p><p>Maoist threats. </p><p> </p><p>MORE FAMILIES INTERNALLY DISPLACED; </p><p>TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE FLEEING TO INDIA </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Officials at the border police post at Nepalganj, </p><p>western Banke district, counted more than 8,000 Nepalis </p><p>crossing into India during December 4-11, the highest </p><p>weekly total ever recorded.  In Rupediya, the Indian town </p><p>just across the border, one bus operator told reporters </p><p>that he has more than doubled his fleet to accommodate the </p><p>emmigrating Nepalis.  According to the moderate weekly </p><p>"Nepali Times," similar scenes take place in towns all </p><p>along the open border with India every day.  Those leaving </p><p>reportedly range in age from infants to the elderly, but </p><p>most are able-bodied men.  Though seasonal labor in India </p><p>is traditional employment for many Nepalis, migrants </p><p>interviewed by the "Nepali Times" say they are going to </p><p>India for security, not simply temporary employment, and </p><p>many have no intention to return to their homeland until </p><p>Nepal\'s security situation improves. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Maoists in western Kailali district have forced 163 </p><p>families of security personnel to leave their homes at </p><p>harvest time, abandoning crops and livestock.  The </p><p>displaced families stated that insurgents did not allow </p><p>them time to pack clothes or supplies before locking them </p><p>out of their houses.  They have settled in the district </p><p>headquarters, and most are forced to borrow money to pay </p><p>daily expenses.  Demands for monetary donations by groups </p><p>of armed Maoists in southern Morang district have prompted </p><p>familes to flee their homes for the relative safety of the </p><p>district capital. </p><p> </p><p>ACAP OFFICES ATTACKED AGAIN; </p><p>ANNAPURNA TOURISM AFFECTED </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>13. (U) Maoists attacked the Annapurna Conservation Area </p><p>Project (ACAP) in Ghandruk for the second time on November </p><p>9, burning several years\' worth of research records an </p><p>d </p><p>destroying the remaining facilities.  The offices, located </p><p>at the Annapurna base camp, were previously looted by </p><p>Maoists on November 8 (ref B).  Damage from the Ghandruk </p><p>attacks is estimated at 3.5 million Nrs (45,000 USD).  On </p><p>the same night, Maoists entered the ACAP offices at Siklis, </p><p>poured cooking fuel from the kitchen over the project\'s </p><p>files and set them ablaze.  Sources at the King Mahendra </p><p>Trust for Nature Conservation, the parent organization for </p><p>ACAP, report that several project offices along the </p><p>Annapurna trekking circuit have been looted and burned by </p><p>the insurgents over the past few weeks. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Tourism in the popular trekking area has declined </p><p>by almost 60 percent following the attacks, according to </p><p>press reports from the region.  Officials at the base camp </p><p>office told reporters that fear of the insurgents has </p><p>prompted many local residents to abandon their businesses </p><p>and leave the village.  News reports from the area state </p><p>that most remaining villagers rarely venture outside their </p><p>homes, and that tourists "have become cautious and control </p><p>their movement even during the day."  Office personnel, who </p><p>stayed in Ghandruk hoping for the security situation to </p><p>improve, are considering shifting the office to another </p><p>location for safety. </p><p> </p><p>WORLD BANK HALTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The World Bank reportedly has halted construction </p><p>of nine irrigation projects in midwestern Nepal, though </p><p>some of the projects were 90 percent complete and millions </p><p>of rupees have already been invested.  Tight restrictions </p><p>imposed on explosives by security forces have prevented the </p><p>Bank from completing the projects, which would have </p><p>provided irrigation to tens of thousands of farmers. </p><p> </p><p>AMCIT BUSINESS RECEIVES EXTORTION LETTER </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) On December 2, the Amcit owner of a carpet </p><p>factory in Kathmandu reported to the Embassy that she had </p><p>received a Maoist extortion letter demanding 500,000 Nrs </p><p>(6400 USD).  In a meeting with ConOffs and A/RSO, the Amcit </p><p>indicated that she had heard from other American business </p><p>owners that they had received similar letters.  A/RSO </p><p>confirmed that the letter conforms to similar demand </p><p>letters sent to businesses, schools and agencies throughout </p><p>the Valley.  ConOff and A/RSO briefed the Amcit on personal </p><p>security and asked her to keep in close contact with the </p><p>Embassy regarding this issue. </p><p> </p><p>PARTIES DENOUNCE VIOLENCE AGAINST MEMBERS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) On December 6, Maoists kidnapped and beheaded CPN- </p><p>UML member and former VDC Chairman Shital Das Chaudhary in </p><p>western Kailali district.  On December 8, stating that the </p><p>Maoists had broken an agreement not to attack party </p><p>members, the CPN-UML standing committee said that they </p><p>could no longer cooperate with the Maoists against the </p><p>palace-appointed government.  "Though other parties have </p><p>called for the Maoists to support the drives against the </p><p>royal moves, we cannot work with them until they stop the </p><p>violence in this country," said a member of the standing </p><p>committee.  Also on December 8, the student wing of the </p><p>CPN-UML protested the Maoist-called indefinite strike </p><p>against Kathmandu Valley schools (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) The People\'s Front of Nepal and the All Nepal </p><p>Peasants\' Association (ANPA) strongly denounced a Maoist </p><p>attack on the family of one of their activists, warning the </p><p>insurgents to "immediately cease violent activities," or </p><p>"face serious consequences."  On November 28, eight Maoists </p><p>broke into the house of Dila Ram Acharya, Secretary General </p><p>of the ANPA, demanded food from his family and threatened </p><p>him with abduction. </p><p> </p><p>NGO CONDEMNS MAOIST ATTACK </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Anti-Slavery International (ASI), a London-based </p><p>human rights organization working to assist the former </p><p>bonded laborers of western Nepal, condemned the Maoist </p><p>attack on a training center run by Backward Society </p><p> </p><p>Education (BASE).  According to an NGO spokesperson, </p><p>Maoists damaged 7O0,00O Nrs (9000 USD) worth of property in </p><p>the attack, which took place on the day the head of BASE </p><p>received a prestigious award from ASI. </p><p> </p><p>ARMY UNDER FIRE FOR DEATH OF MINORS </p><p>20. (U) Parents of five young men killed by Royal Nepal </p><p>Army troops last month filed a complaint with the </p><p>administration office in central Nuwakot district on </p><p>December 11, seeking compensation for the deaths and </p><p>calling them "murder."  The Ministry of Defense has </p><p>released a statement claiming that the boys, who ranged in </p><p>age from 14 to 19, were Maoist terrorists killed in an </p><p>encounter with security forces.  Family members said that </p><p>security personnel had told them that the boys were shot </p><p>"because they were walking at night with torch-lights in </p><p>their hands." </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) On December 8, the Human Rights and Peace Society, </p><p>a local NGO, accused security forces of killing nine </p><p>"innocent and unarmed youth" in two separate incidents in </p><p>southern pang district.  The human rights organization </p><p>noted that the young men were out after a curfew, but </p><p>asserted that the security forces should have been able to </p><p>easily take the youths into custody instead of killing </p><p>them.  The Ministry of Defense once again released a </p><p>statement claiming that the young men, who ranged in age </p><p>from 15 to 22, were Maoist terrorists killed in an </p><p>encounter with security forces. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
