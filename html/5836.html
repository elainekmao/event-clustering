(C) THE HOLY SEE\'S MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, MONSIGNOR FRANCO </p><p>COPPOLA, WHO ACCOMPANIED PAPAL SPECIAL ENVOY CARDINAL ROGER </p><p>ETCHEGARAY TO BAGHDAD, GAVE DCM A FULL READOUT FEBRUARY 19 OF </p><p>ETCHEGARAY\'S VISIT AND FEBRUARY 15 MEETING WITH SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN.  ACCORDING TO COPPOLA, THE PAPAL MISSION TO BAGHDAD </p><p>WAS UNDERTAKEN BOTH TO REINFORCE WITH SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS </p><p>OF HIS SITUATION AND HIS NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO COOPERATE </p><p>FULLY WITH UNMOVIC, WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO "CREATE A SENSE OF </p><p>TRUST" WITH SADDAM THAT THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES COULD HELP THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ACHIEVE ITS GOAL OF IRAQI DISARMAMENT </p><p>WITHOUT RECOURSE TO WAR.  ON THE BASIS OF THE VISIT, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE BELIEVES THAT FIRM, BUT NON-CONFRONTATIONAL, DIPLOMACY </p><p>THAT AVOIDS "HUMILIATING" SADDAM CAN ACHIEVE IRAQ\'S </p><p>DISARMAMENT WITHOUT RESORT TO A WAR THAT THEY FEAR WOULD </p><p>INFLAME FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM WITH "INCALCULABLE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES."  COPPOLA VOICED THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERN AT HOW </p><p>RECENT TRANSATLANTIC DIVISIONS AND A PERCEPTION OF DIVISION </p><p>BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE U.S. HAVE PLAYED OUT IN THE </p><p>PRESS.  THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED THUS FAR </p><p>WITH IRAQ IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL UNITY, AND THEY WORRY THAT PERCEPTIONS OF </p><p>DIVISION WILL UNDERMINE THE PRESSURE ON SADDAM.  WITH PM </p><p>BLAIR SET TO MEET THE POPE FEBRUARY 22, EMBASSY BELIEVES A </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL U.S. VISIT TO THE HOLY SEE COULD HELP REINFORCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00683  01 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>THE PERCEPTION OF UNITY AND HIGHLIGHT THE SHARED U.S.-HOLY </p><p>SEE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE A PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>ETCHEGARAY DELIVERS POPE\'S MESSAGE TO SADDAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  HOLY SEE MFA MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCO </p><p>COPPOLA GAVE DCM AND POLOFF A DETAILED READOUT FEBRUARY 19 OF </p><p>HIS WEEK-LONG TRIP TO BAGHDAD WITH PAPAL SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>CARDINAL ROGER ETCHEGARAY.  COPPOLA TOLD US THE TRIP WAS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN TO IMPRESS UPON SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND TO URGE HIS FULL AND IMMEDIATE </p><p>COOPERATION WITH UNSCR 1441.  COPPOLA EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE BELIEVES SADDAM HAS THUS FAR BEEN TOO PRONE TO </p><p>PREVARICATION AND DECEPTION, AND THAT THE TRIP WAS SEEN BY </p><p>THE VATICAN AS ITS LAST BEST CHANCE TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO </p><p>SADDAM AND AVERT A WAR.  RECOGNIZING THE "DICTATOR\'S </p><p>MENTALITY" THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER IN DELIVERING SUCH A MESSAGE, </p><p>ETCHEGARAY SOUGHT NOT TO CHALLENGE SADDAM DIRECTLY, BUT TO </p><p>GIVE HIM A SENSE THAT, BY WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO MEET ITS DEMANDS FOR DISARMAMENT, HE COULD ALSO </p><p>ACHIEVE WHAT HE WANTS (CONTINUED POWER).  ETCHEGARAY DID IN </p><p>FACT UNDERSCORE TO SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION </p><p>AND THE NEED TO WORK WITH UNMOVIC, TO WHICH SADDAM\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS BOTH DEFIANT AND FATALISTIC.  HE </p><p>OFFERED THE STANDARD LINE THAT IRAQ WAS COMPLYING, THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WAS PURSUING A WAR OF AGGRESSION, AND THAT IRAQIS WOULD </p><p>FIGHT TO THE END. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00683  01 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>DEALING WITH THE "DICTATOR MENTALITY" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DESPITE SADDAM\'S SURFACE OBSTINACY, HOWEVER, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE BELIEVES THE INTERNATIONAL UNITY AND FIRM DIPLOMACY </p><p>BACKED BY A CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE FROM THE U.S. AND OTHERS </p><p>HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT, IF INCOMPLETE, ADVANCES SINCE </p><p>THE FALL, REFLECTED BY SADDAM\'S ACCEPTANCE OF UNMOVIC, THE </p><p>DECISION TO PERMIT OVERFLIGHTS, AND RECENT MOVEMENT ON </p><p>PRIVATE INTERVIEWS WITH IRAQI SCIENTISTS.  THEY BELIEVE THAT </p><p>FULL DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH CONTINUED FIRM BUT </p><p>SUBTLE DIPLOMACY THAT WOULD OFFER SADDAM BOTH A FACE-SAVING </p><p>ESCAPE FROM HIS PREDICAMENT AND PERSONAL SURVIVAL.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO COPPOLA, THE KEY TO PROGRESS IN IRAQ WAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>CORNERED DICTATORS LIKE SADDAM WILL DIG IN WHEN CONFRONTED. </p><p>"THEY ARE NOT USED TO DISCUSSING THINGS AND BEING </p><p>CHALLENGED," COPPOLA OBSERVED.  "IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS </p><p>FROM THEM, THEY CANNOT BE HUMILIATED."  RATHER, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>REGARDS IT AS ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH A DEGREE OF "TRUST" -- </p><p>"NOT TRUST OF SADDAM TO BE SURE" -- BUT THE KIND OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BUSINESSMEN THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN </p><p>IT FOR EVERYONE IF ALL PLAY BY THE RULES.  IN THIS WAY, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9130 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------388B98  200658Z /38 </p><p>O 200609Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 000683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR, EUR/WE-MENNUTI, NEA, S-KELLY AND GRAZE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM MEETING WITH CARDINAL ETCHEGARAY: VATICAN </p><p>SEES "LAST CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY" </p><p> </p><p>COPPOLA CONCLUDED, DIPLOMACY CAN SECURE THE DISARMAMENT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS AND THE SURVIVAL SADDAM SEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) TO BACK UP THIS CASE, THE HOLY SEE VIEWS THE FACT THAT </p><p>SADDAM CONVENED HIS RUBBER-STAMP PARLIAMENT ON THE FRIDAY </p><p>CONCLUDING THE HADJ TO PROMULGATE THE LAW BANNING WMD (WHICH </p><p>WAS SUGGESTED BY ETCHEGARAY AT THE HOLY SEE\'S REQUEST) AS A </p><p>SIGN OF SADDAM\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WORKING DISCRETELY RATHER THAN </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH SADDAM, ETCHEGARAY HAD PRESSED THE IRAQIS TO </p><p>OFFER SOME SORT OF SIGN THAT THEY HAD ABANDONED EFFORTS TO </p><p>"NEGOTIATE" COMPLIANCE WITH THE I/C AND TO BUILD ON THEIR </p><p>LIMITED COOPERATION BEFORE HANS BLIX\' FEBRUARY 14 REPORT TO </p><p>THE UNSC.  THE HOLY SEE REGARDS THIS RESULT -- DESPITE ITS </p><p>LIMITED EFFECT -- AS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF IRAQI WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO COOPERATE IF NOT BACKED INTO A CORNER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WHAT DO WE WANT? </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN DETERMINING THE WAY FORWARD, COPPOLA SAID THE </p><p>APPROACH DEPENDED ON THE REAL GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  IF THE GOAL IS TO REMOVE SADDAM, THEN HE AGREED </p><p>THAT WAR IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND QUICKEST METHOD.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE WORLD MUST THEN BE PREPARED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF </p><p>THIS DECISION -- WHICH COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF CONTROL OF </p><p>SADDAM\'S WMD TO TERRORISTS IN THE CHAOS OF BATTLE OR ITS </p><p>IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, DEATH OF ALLIED SOLDIERS AND IRAQI </p><p>CIVILIANS, ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION, AND, MOST WORRISOME TO </p><p>THE HOLY SEE, THE UNLEASHING OF EVER GREATER FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>PASSIONS WITH "INCALCULABLE CONSEQUENCES."  IF, ON THE OTHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>HAND, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GENUINELY SEEKS TO DISARM </p><p>IRAQ OF WMD, SUBTLE DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT DOESN\'T </p><p>"HUMILIATE" SADDAM CAN WORK, COPPOLA BELIEVED.  HE ASSERTED </p><p>THAT EVER GREATER PRESSURE FROM INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING </p><p>WOULD INCREASINGLY HINDER SADDAM\'S ABILITY TO POSE A THREAT. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, HE MAINTAINED THAT STEPPED UP INTELLIGENCE AND </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL "SURGICAL STRIKES" ON </p><p>SUSPECTED WEAPONS SITES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ALL-OUT </p><p>WAR IN ACHIEVING DISARMAMENT WITHOUT GENERATING CHAOS THAT </p><p>COULD LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WMD FROM IRAQ.  PRESSED ON </p><p>THIS POINT, COPPOLA ASSERTED THAT WAR WOULD CAUSE SUCH CHAOS </p><p>IN IRAQ (WHICH HE ALREADY CHARACTERIZED AS A HOPELESSLY </p><p>DISORGANIZED SOCIETY) THAT ANY WMD NOT IMMEDIATELY DESTROYED </p><p>WOULD SURELY BE SPIRITED AWAY TO PRECISELY THOSE PLAYERS </p><p>(INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS) MOST LIKELY TO USE THEM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN THE DISARMAMENT SCENARIO, COPPOLA OBSERVED, GAINING </p><p>IRAQI COOPERATION WOULD REQUIRE BUILDING SOME TRUST AND </p><p>CONFIDENCE, WHICH IS WHAT THE ETCHEGARAY MISSION HOPED TO </p><p>BEGIN.  "THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE FORWARD IS AWAY FROM THE TV </p><p>CAMERAS, TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND."  HE NOTED THAT EVEN THE </p><p>WORST PEOPLE OFTEN BELIEVE THEY ARE GOOD, THAT THEY ARE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE RIGHT AND JUST PATH, OR, IN SADDAM\'S CASE, THAT </p><p>HE IS COLLABORATING.  ETCHEGARAY\'S MISSION, COPPOLA </p><p>CONCLUDED, SOUGHT TO CREATE AN OPENING TO CONVINCE SADDAM </p><p>THAT HE COULD OBTAIN WHAT HE WANTS BETTER IN COLLABORATION </p><p>WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RATHER THAN IN CONFRONTATION </p><p>WITH IT.  THAT SAID, THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THAT TIME IS NOT </p><p>ON THE SIDE OF PEACE UNLESS SADDAM ACCEPTS THE NEED TO </p><p>COOPERATE FULLY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE MOOD IN BAGHDAD </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  ASKED HIS IMPRESSIONS OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION </p><p>OF IRAQIS HE MET WHILE IN BAGHDAD, COPPOLA SAID THEY ARE </p><p>"RESIGNED TO WAR, FATALISTIC IN THE ARAB WAY."  HE SAID MANY </p><p>APPEAR TO WANT TO LEAVE, AND ARE MAKING PLANS TO DO SO, BUT </p><p>THAT THE REGIME HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE - IN ORDER TO HAVE AS </p><p>MANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AS POSSIBLE SHOULD WAR ERUPT.  GIVEN </p><p>THE RISKS IRAQI CIVILIANS WOULD FACE, COPPOLA INFORMED US </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RESPOND TO A J5 REQUEST </p><p>CONVEYED TO THEM TO LIST AND IDENTIFY HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>OTHER CATHOLIC SITES ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  COPPOLA SAID "WE </p><p>CANNOT SAY IT\'S NOT \'OK\' TO BOMB HERE, BUT IT IS \'OK\' TO BOMB </p><p>THERE." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AS SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO CLARIFIED IN AN INTERVIEW </p><p>YESTERDAY, THE HOLY SEE IS NOT PACIFIST, BUT IS SEEKING TO BE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9132 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00683  03 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------388BA3  200659Z /38 </p><p>O 200609Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 000683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR, EUR/WE-MENNUTI, NEA, S-KELLY AND GRAZE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM MEETING WITH CARDINAL ETCHEGARAY: VATICAN </p><p>SEES "LAST CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY" </p><p> </p><p>A PEACEMAKER, "WORKING INTENSELY TO PREVENT THE OUTBREAK OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00683  03 OF 03  200658Z </p><p>CONFLICTS."  FOLLOWING ETCHEGARAY\'S MISSION, THE HOLY SEE IS </p><p>GUARDEDLY OPTIMISTIC THAT DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED </p><p>PEACEFULLY, AS THEY CAME AWAY WITH A SENSE THAT IRAQ NOW </p><p>UNDERSTANDS IT NEEDS TO BE GENUINELY, AND NOT BEGRUDGINGLY, </p><p>COLLABORATIVE.  WHILE THE ETCHEGARAY VISIT WAS THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>LAST, BEST SHOT AT CONVINCING SADDAM TO COMPLY, WE CAN EXPECT </p><p>THE HOLY SEE TO CONTINUE TO PRESS ITS CASE PUBLICLY AND </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT WAR SHOULD BE THE VERY LAST OPTION.
