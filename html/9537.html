OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Turkey (GOT) views foreign direct </p><p>investment as vital to the country\'s economic </p><p>development and prosperity.  Accordingly, Turkey has one </p><p>of the most liberal legal regimes for FDI in the OECD. </p><p>With the exception of some sectors (see below), areas </p><p>open to the Turkish private sector are generally open to </p><p>foreign participation and investment.  However, all </p><p>companies - regardless of nationality of ownership - </p><p>face a number of obstacles:  high inflation, political </p><p>and macroeconomic uncertainties, excessive bureaucracy, </p><p>weaknesses in the judicial system, high and </p><p>inconsistently collected taxes, weaknesses in corporate </p><p>governance, arbitrary decisions taken at the municipal </p><p>level, and frequent, sometimes unclear changes in the </p><p>legal and regulatory environment.  As a result, FDI </p><p>inflows, at well below one percent of GDP over the last </p><p>decade, have been far below that of more investor- </p><p>friendly emerging markets as well as of Turkey\'s </p><p>potential.  The GOT\'s far-reaching program of economic </p><p>and political reform agreed with the World Bank and IMF, </p><p>and motivated also by multilateral agreements and EU </p><p>accession, should address many of these problems, if </p><p>fully and effectively implemented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regulations governing foreign investment are, in </p><p>general, transparent.  A 1954 law on foreign investment </p><p>(Law No. 6224) was substantially modified and </p><p>liberalized by a 1995 Decree (Decree No. 95/6990) and </p><p>associated communiqu.  Legislation approved by </p><p>Parliament in June 2003 (Law 4875 on Direct Foreign </p><p>Investment) further liberalized the foreign direct </p><p>investment regime by:  eliminating screening of foreign </p><p>investors in favor of a notification system; providing </p><p>national treatment in acquisition of real estate to </p><p>foreign-owned entities registered under Turkish law; and </p><p>abolishing the specific minimum capital requirement for </p><p>foreign investments (general capital requirements for </p><p>all companies contained in the Turkish Commercial Code </p><p>will continue to apply).  However, implementing </p><p>regulations for the new law are not yet in place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The June 2003 law also scrapped several additional </p><p>requirements, including  a minimum USD 50,000 investment </p><p>requirement to establish a corporation, become partners </p><p>in an existing company, or open a branch office; the </p><p>requirement to seek permission from Treasury if the </p><p>capital increase would change the participation ratio </p><p>between the foreign investor and any local partners; and </p><p>Turkish companies were required to register with </p><p>Treasury any licensing, management, or franchising </p><p>agreements concluded with foreign persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign investors are subject to restrictions on </p><p>establishment in certain sectors. The equity </p><p>participation ratio of foreign shareholders is </p><p>restricted to 20 percent in broadcasting, and 49 percent </p><p>in aviation, value-added telecommunication services, and </p><p>maritime transportation.  However, companies receive </p><p>full national treatment once they are established. </p><p>Establishment in financial services, including banking </p><p>and insurance, and in the petroleum sector requires </p><p>special permission from the GOT for both domestic and </p><p>foreign investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT privatizes State Economic Enterprises through </p><p>block sales, public offerings, or a combination of both. </p><p>Foreign investors generally receive national treatment </p><p>in privatization programs. Turkish law allows foreign </p><p>investors to acquire up to 45 percent of Turk Telecom, </p><p>the monopoly provider of voice and other </p><p>telecommunications services, with the Turkish government </p><p>retain a single "golden" (blocking) share, in the </p><p>company\'s upcoming privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish Parliament also passed legislation in June </p><p>2003 which should streamline the company registration </p><p>process (see Section 8 - Transparency of the Regulatory </p><p>System).  Another new law on work permits for foreign </p><p>citizens which will take effect later in 2003 should </p><p>give the Labor and Social Security Ministry additional </p><p>authority in this area (see Section 5 - Performance </p><p>Requirements/Incentives). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish law and regulation concerning investment climate </p><p>continues to evolve.  We recommend checking with </p><p>appropriate Turkish government sources for current and </p><p>detailed information in this area.  The following web </p><p>site provides the text of regulations governing foreign </p><p>investment and incentives: </p><p>www.treasury.gov.tr/english/ybsweb.  A summary of these </p><p>regulations can be found at: </p><p>www.dtm.gov.tr/english/doing/iginvest/invest/ htm and </p><p>www.igeme.org.tr/introeng.htm.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONVERSION AND TRANSFER POLICIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish law guarantees the free transfer of profits, </p><p>fees and royalties, and repatriation of capital.  This </p><p>guarantee is reflected in Turkey\'s Bilateral Investment </p><p>Treaty with the United States, which mandates </p><p>unrestricted and prompt transfer in a freely usable </p><p>currency at a legal market clearing rate for all funds </p><p>related to an investment.  There is no difficulty in </p><p>obtaining foreign exchange.  There are no limitations on </p><p>the inflow or outflow of funds for remittances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty with the </p><p>United States (codifying existing Turkish law), </p><p>expropriation can only occur in accordance with </p><p>international law and due process.  Expropriations must </p><p>be for public purpose and non-discriminatory. </p><p>Compensation must be reasonably prompt, adequate, and </p><p>effective.  Under the Bilateral Investment Treaty, U.S. </p><p>investors have full access to the local court system and </p><p>the ability to take the host government directly to </p><p>third party international binding arbitration to settle </p><p>investment disputes.  There is also a provision for </p><p>state-to-state dispute settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a practical matter, the GOT occasionally expropriates </p><p>private property for public works or for State </p><p>Enterprise industrial projects.  The GOT agency </p><p>expropriating the property negotiates and proposes a </p><p>purchase price.  If the owners of the property do not </p><p>agree with the proposed price, they can go to court to </p><p>challenge the expropriation or ask for more </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  DISPUTE SETTLEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no outstanding expropriation or </p><p>nationalization cases.  However, there are several </p><p>investment disputes between U.S. companies and Turkish </p><p>government bodies, particularly in the energy and </p><p>tourism sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s legal system provides means for enforcing </p><p>property and contractual rights. The court system is </p><p>overburdened, however, which sometimes results in slow </p><p>decisions and judges lacking sufficient time to grasp </p><p>complex issues.  The judicial system is also perceived </p><p>by the public and by business to be susceptible to </p><p>external political and commercial influence to some </p><p>degree.  Judgments of foreign courts need to be </p><p>reconsidered by local courts before they are accepted </p><p>and enforced.  Turkey has written and consistently </p><p>applied commercial and bankruptcy laws.  Monetary </p><p>judgements are usually made in local currency, but there </p><p>are provisions for incorporating exchange rate </p><p>differentials in claims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a signatory of the Washington Convention, and </p><p>a member of the International Center for the Settlement </p><p>of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and is a signatory of </p><p>the New York Convention of 1958 on the recognition and </p><p>enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.  Turkey ratified </p><p>the Convention of the Multinational Investment Guarantee </p><p>Agency (MIGA) in 1987. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish government accepts binding international </p><p>arbitration of investment disputes between foreign </p><p>investors and the state; this principle is included in </p><p>the U.S.-Turkish Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).  For </p><p>many years, there was an exception for "concessions" </p><p>involving private (primarily foreign) investment in </p><p>public services.  In 1999, the Parliament passed </p><p>amendments to the constitution allowing foreign </p><p>companies access to international arbitration for </p><p>concessionary contracts.  In 2000, the Turkish </p><p>government completed implementing legislation for </p><p>arbitration.  In 2001, the Parliament approved a law </p><p>further expanding the scope of international arbitration </p><p>in Turkish contracts.  In practice, however, Turkish </p><p>courts have on at least one occasion failed to uphold an </p><p>international arbitration ruling involving private </p><p>companies. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
