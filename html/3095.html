<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH FOR POL - R. HANKS </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 06/07/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, XY, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECOWAS EXECSEC CHAMBAS\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>LIBERIA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE TIM ANDREWS. REASON 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During two recent conversations with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, the last on May 24, ECOWAS ExeSec </p><p>Chambas outlined the game-plan for Liberia developed </p><p>at the May 17 Heads of State meeting in Yamoussoukro. </p><p>Presidents Obasanjo and Wade were appointed to broker </p><p>political reconciliation and a GOL-LURD cease-fire </p><p>while an ECOWAS technical group would visit Liberia to </p><p>assess the security situation in order to advise Wade </p><p>and Obasanjo. Chambas realized a cease-fire would be </p><p>difficult; the LURD would demand political </p><p>compensation for its quiescence while the GOL would </p><p>resist any step insinuating legitimacy or territorial </p><p>control for the rebel group. Chambas worried that </p><p>mediation would be hampered by Obasanjo\'s domestic </p><p>electoral distractions and Wade\'s inexperience on </p><p>Liberia. Chambas also wondered how to coax Guinea to </p><p>play a constructive role. Chambas blamed Taylor\'s near </p><p>total expropriation of Liberia\'s political space as </p><p>the reason for a recrudescent LURD. In the end, Taylor </p><p>must loosen his stranglehold on the political process </p><p>for progress to be achieved.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a May 24 late evening meeting, ECOWAS </p><p>ExeSec Chambas told Ambassador Jeter, joined by </p><p>PolCouns, that he had just concluded a two-hour </p><p>meeting, mostly devoted to Liberia, with President </p><p>Obasanjo. While relaxed and at times joking, Chambas </p><p>acknowledged the difficult terrain ahead and </p><p>understood the road to ending the fighting in Liberia </p><p>was twisting and all uphill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>YAMOUSSOUKRO DID NOT MEET GOL EXPECTATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Describing the dynamics at Yamoussoukro, </p><p>Chambas said the proposed resolution drafted by the </p><p>ECOWAS Ministerial Mediation and Security Council was </p><p>more favorable to the GOL then the final communique </p><p>issued by the Heads of State. The differences in the </p><p>documents also reflected the divergent tenors of the </p><p>meetings. While the foreign ministers were attracted </p><p>to the legal argument against the LURD for attacking </p><p>the elected, nominally democratic GOL, the political </p><p>heads showed diminished sympathy for the GOL position. </p><p>Thus, while the final communique shared key provisions </p><p>contained in the Ministers\' draft, e.g. immediate </p><p>cease-fire, dispatch of a military assessment team and </p><p>political dialogue, the political leaders omitted the </p><p>strong condemnation of the LURD and the specific </p><p>reference to ECOMOG intervention in the absence of a </p><p>cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: While not saying so explicitly, </p><p>Chambas implied that Liberian ForMin Captan, subbing </p><p>for President Taylor at Yamoussoukro, emerged from the </p><p>Heads of State meeting disappointed. The small but </p><p>symbolic diplomatic victory in his grasp at the </p><p>Ministerial had vanished.  Instead of winning an </p><p>explicit castigation of the LURD as well as a </p><p>statement that ECOMOG might intervene on behalf of the </p><p>GOL, the final communique labeled both the LURD and </p><p>GOL "belligerents," thus making no moral </p><p>differentiation between the two sides. President </p><p>Wade\'s public statement immediately after the meeting </p><p>that ECOMOG intervention in Liberia was not </p><p>contemplated also irked Taylor. In the final analysis, </p><p>what the GOL achieved at Yamoussoukro was a </p><p>frustrating diplomatic stalemate. President Taylor\'s </p><p>refusal to accept the GON invitation to come to Abuja </p><p>after Yamoussoukro probably likely was a by-product of </p><p>that frustration. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The communique\'s nuances and its parsing </p><p>notwithstanding, obtaining the actual cease-fire would </p><p>be complicated, Chambas predicted. The LURD must be </p><p>convinced to stop but the group\'s accession would not </p><p>be without costs. Chambas\'s wondered, not if demands </p><p>would be made, but what LURD\'s demands might be. </p><p>Conversely, the GOL promised to be dogged in its </p><p>position that the LURD, being an insurgent adversary </p><p>of an elected government, did not have the standing to </p><p>make political demands on the GOL. Shortening the </p><p>distance between these positions would require </p><p>sustained diplomatic effort by ECOWAS, he offered. </p><p>Nigeria was key, as no other ECOWAS state could </p><p>approximate Nigeria\'s potential clout over the </p><p>Liberian actors. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>---- </p><p>OBASANJO -- POLITICS AT HOME TRUMPS A STATESMAN ROLE </p><p>ABROAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) However, given the demands of the Nigerian </p><p>electoral season, the ExeSec was unsure whether </p><p>Obasanjo could devote adequate time to this cause. </p><p>Chambas thought Obasanjo should call the LURD leaders </p><p>to Abuja to open a dialogue with them; however, </p><p>Chambas had not conveyed the idea to Obasanjo because </p><p>he did not want to overtax the Nigerian leader\'s </p><p>schedule. Because of this caution, neither Obasanjo </p><p>nor Chambas personally have met any of the declared </p><p>LURD leaders. After discussing Obasanjo\'s ambitious </p><p>travel schedule for the summer, Chambas worried that </p><p>Obasanjo might not have the time to take advantage of </p><p>whatever positive momentum generated by the </p><p>Yamoussoukro meting. As the clock ticked toward the </p><p>PDP national convention slated for October and the </p><p>subsequent presidential campaign, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>concentration on Liberia would only further diminish. </p><p>Chambas speculated that Obasanjo should appoint a </p><p>Special Envoy but could not think of current player in </p><p>Obasanjo\'s foreign policy team with the requisite </p><p>stature and experience with Liberia to do the job </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Chambas discounted the rumor that Nigeria was </p><p>supplying arms to the GOL, stating he saw no signs of </p><p>such closeness between Obasanjo and Taylor. He also </p><p>contended that establishing a "son of ECOMOG" for </p><p>Liberia was highly unlikely. The leaders did not show </p><p>stomach for this at the Summit. Moreover, domestic </p><p>considerations in the two most likely troop </p><p>contributing states precluded deployment. Electoral </p><p>considerations would discourage Obasanjo and President </p><p>Kufuor has his hands full with ethno-political trouble </p><p>in Northern Ghana. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>WADE -- HIS MIND AND HEART MAY BE ELSEWHERE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Chambas confided that the Senegalese President </p><p>Wade might not be very effective because neither Wade </p><p>nor his senior foreign policy advisors knew much about </p><p>Liberia. Despite his selection as ECOWAS Chairman, </p><p>Wade was more focused on Madagascar\'s presidential </p><p>tug-of-war than the political and security challenges </p><p>facing the Mano River Union\'s two Anglophone members. </p><p>Chambas mentioned that Wade was tasked with generating </p><p>diplomatic and, if needed, material support within the </p><p>international community for ECOWAS efforts on Liberia. </p><p>Chambas hoped the selection of senior UN official </p><p>Ibrahim Fall, also Senegalese, to head the UN\'s new </p><p>West Africa office located in Dakar would help </p><p>reorient Wade, particularly in helping Wade reach out </p><p>to the international community for assistance on </p><p>Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GUINEA -- VIOLATOR AS WELL AS VICTIM? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Given that the LURD used Guinea as its primary </p><p>base, Chambas stated that ECOWAS needed to develop a </p><p>strategy that considered Guinea\'s role and interests. </p><p>Chambas mentioned the ECOWAS communique endorsed the </p><p>Rabat process but said the gesture was essentially pro </p><p>forma. While admitting no detailed knowledge of what </p><p>happened in Rabat, Chambas did not show great </p><p>confidence in that process. He recognized Conte had </p><p>serious security concerns due to Liberia\'s prior </p><p>aggression and that Conte\'s continued mistrust of and </p><p>deep animus for Taylor caused Conte to view the LURD </p><p>with benign indifference, at minimum. However, he </p><p>stated that ECOWAS needed to develop a strategy that </p><p>would respond to Conte\'s apprehension about Taylor\'s </p><p>hegemonic appetite but also pressure Conte to suppress </p><p>the LURD. Chambas fretted that although Conte </p><p>currently may have the upper hand on Taylor, the </p><p>Guinean was engaged in a risky gambit. Guinea has </p><p>significant domestic problems -- allowing a rag-tag </p><p>rebel force to inhabit portions of territory where </p><p>your government\'s control is thin could hand Conte </p><p>problems in the long run. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: In addition to seeing the LURD </p><p>contemned by ECOWAS Heads of State, a secondary GOL </p><p>objective at Yamoussoukro probably was to shift more </p><p>diplomatic pressure on Guinea to cease hosting the </p><p>LURD. However, because of perceptions that Taylor\'s </p><p>megalomania is both father and mother to most problems </p><p>within Liberia and between the two countries, the GOL </p><p>did not register much success tarring Guinea as the </p><p>sponsor of instability.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>TAYLOR -- HE HAS THE WHOLE MESS IN HIS HANDS! </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Despite the multiple aspects of this recent </p><p>Liberian crisis, its gestation lies in Taylor\'s </p><p>malevolent governance and his stiff opposition to the </p><p>development of a meaningful political opposition. </p><p>Chambas asserted that his efforts are based on the </p><p>assumption that Taylor is not incorrigible and can be </p><p>ultimately be turned in the right direction. However, </p><p>the Liberian\'s intransigence is testing that premise. </p><p>In the end, the ExeSec maintained Taylor must loosen </p><p>his grip and allow the opposition to operate freely. </p><p>The GOL must enter a dialogue aimed at creating the </p><p>conditions for fair elections. Chambas asserted that a </p><p>cease-fire without the GOL making concessions on the </p><p>political side would be untenable. The GOL would have </p><p>no incentive to change its ways after obtaining the </p><p>cease-fire. While the LURD presence was unfortunate </p><p>and should not be encouraged, it has put pressure on </p><p>Taylor that did not previously exist, he maintained. </p><p>The challenge is for ECOWAS to use that pressure in a </p><p>manner that is not misinterpreted as condoning the </p><p>LURD yet in a way that gets Taylor to accept </p><p>nonviolent political opposition at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Himself formerly a rebel leader, who stalked </p><p>an unpopular Head of State, Taylor is now being </p><p>pursued by late President Doe\'s former associates. </p><p>This predicament smacks of karma. However, belief in </p><p>reciprocal justice alone will not solve this problem. </p><p>Diplomacy is needed. Save for not having opened a </p><p>formal line of communication with the LURD, Chambas </p><p>has a good grasp of the motivations, limitations and </p><p>interests of the players. (We have encouraged him to </p><p>develop that contact with the LURD. The longer they </p><p>are left unattended, the more recalcitrant they will </p><p>be when talks finally come.) ECOWAS has dispatched the </p><p>five-man technical team to Liberia, and their report </p><p>will help advise Presidents Wade and Obasanjo, Chambas </p><p>and the Ministerial Mediation and Security Council, </p><p>which will continue to play a role in ECOWAS efforts. </p><p>The Yamoussoukro communique provides a skeletal </p><p>framework for moving forward. ECOWAS must use that </p><p>framework to develop a strategy that puts the right </p><p>pressures on the LURD, the GOL and the political </p><p>opposition as well as offers them the right </p><p>incentives. While Chambas has not fleshed out the </p><p>details, his statements indicate that this will </p><p>require some type of linkage of a cease-fire to </p><p>political reform, particularly of the electoral </p><p>process. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
