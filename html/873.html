(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JEFFREY JACOBS, REASON 1.5 </p><p>(D) . </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  FEW ISSUES ARE OF GREATER LONG-TERM CONCERN TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF </p><p>ETHIOPIA (GFDRE) THAN THE THREAT OF MILITANT POLITICAL </p><p>ISLAM.  AT PRESENT THE GFDRE FACES LITTLE INTERNAL THREAT </p><p>FROM ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUPS, BUT SPORADIC VIOLENCE </p><p>BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAS TAKEN </p><p>PLACE ALONG THE BORDER WITH SOMALIA, AND ISLAMIC </p><p>EXTREMISTS ARE BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR A SERIES OF </p><p>RECENT HOTEL BOMBINGS AND AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON AN </p><p>ETHNIC SOMALI MINISTER.  ALTHOUGH THE 1994 CONSTITUTION </p><p>GUARANTEES FREEDOM OF RELIGION, AND THIS IS RESPECTED IN </p><p>PRACTICE, PAST REGIMES SUBSIDIZED THE CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH WHILE MUSLIM INSTITUTIONS ATROPHIED.  THE </p><p>GFDRE IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>MUSLIMS AND TO ASSIST THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL (SIC), </p><p>THE ONLY GRASSROOTS ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION WITH NATIONAL </p><p>SCOPE.  MUSLIMS ARE PLEASED WITH THE RELIGIOUS POLICIES </p><p>OF THE GFDRE, BUT ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS IN </p><p>DISARRAY AND STRUGGLING TO REORGANIZE.  HAVING SAID THIS, </p><p>THE NUMBER OF ADHERENTS TO ISLAM IS GROWING FAST AND </p><p>MUSLIMS MAY SOON OUTNUMBER THE SLOW GROWING AND </p><p>CONSERVATIVE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THIS CABLE </p><p>FULFILLS A REQUIREMENT OF THE POST REPORTING PLAN. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>REVAMPED ISLAMIC COUNCIL OCCUPIES NEW OFFICES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF AND POL/ECON FSN MET WITH SENIOR OFFICERS </p><p>OF THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL (SIC) IN THEIR NEW OFFICE </p><p>ON 20 MARCH.  THE SIC MOVED IN LATE 1996 FROM CRAMPED </p><p>OFFICES NEAR THE GRAND MOSQUE IN THE DENSELY POPULATED </p><p>MARKET DISTRICT TO MORE SPACIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS SEVERAL </p><p>KILOMETERS AWAY.  THE COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1974 BY </p><p>THE FORMER DERG REGIME, FOLLOWING LARGE ISLAMIC </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE HAILE SELASSIE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>MUSLIM LEADERS SEE THEIR ROLE AS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE </p><p>GFDRE AND ETHIOPIA\'S LARGE MUSLIM COMMUNITY.  MUSLIMS </p><p>CONSTITUTE MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF ETHIOPIA\'S POPULATION </p><p>OF AT LEAST 56 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>FORMER SIC LEADERSHIP DISMISSED FOR CORRUPTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL IS THE ONLY GRASSROOTS </p><p>ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION WITH NATIONAL SCOPE, COUNCIL LEADERS </p><p>ARE STRUGGLING TO REORGANIZE AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT AND </p><p>CORRUPTION.  THE SIC WAS RESTRUCTURED IN 1992 AND WAS </p><p>REVAMPED AGAIN IN OCTOBER, 1996, FOLLOWING THE ARREST AND </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF NEARLY ALL TOP SIC OFFICIALS FOR </p><p>CORRUPTION.  OF THE SIC LEADERS KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY IN </p><p>1994 (REF A), ONLY GENERAL SECRETARY ABDURAZAK MOHAMMED </p><p>REMAINS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE NEW COUNCIL IS MORE STREAMLINED AND PROVIDES </p><p>FOR EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL OF ETHIOPIA\'S FEDERAL </p><p>STATES.  THE COUNCIL CONSISTS OF 121 MEMBERS.  EACH STATE </p><p>HAS 11 MEMBERS WHILE THE MORE POPULOUS OROMIYA REGIONAL </p><p>STATE HAS 12.  THE GROUP\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS </p><p>THIRTEEN MEMBERS.  THE FORMER CHAIRMAN, HAJI MOHAMMED </p><p>AHMED AMAN, DIED IN LATE 1996 AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED </p><p>UNTIL THE PLANNED JUNE 1997 SIC CONFERENCE.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>HAS ALSO ELIMINATED THE POSITION OF SECOND VICE-CHAIRMAN </p><p>AND DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MOST AFFILIATED ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS IN LIMBO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  PREVIOUSLY THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL WAS AN </p><p>UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION WITH SEVERAL AFFILIATED ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUPS (REF A), BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS ACCUSED THE FORMER </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF USING THE VARIOUS GROUPS TO MISAPPROPRIATE </p><p>FUNDS AND THE AFFILIATED GROUPS HAVE FALLEN INTO </p><p>DISARRAY.  THE ETHIOPIAN KORANIC ORGANIZATION STILL </p><p>EXISTS ON PAPER, BUT IS INACTIVE.  THE ETHIOPIAN ULEMA </p><p>(MUSLIM CLERICS) ARE EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS WITH FORMAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.  THE ULEMA DEAL WITH ALL RELIGIOUS </p><p>ISSUES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL.  THE COUNCIL IS IN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE ULEMA SYSTEM WITH THE </p><p>GOAL OF PUTTING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS </p><p>NATIONWIDE TO TEACH THE TRUE FAITH TO BELIEVERS.  THE SIC </p><p>HOPES TO HOLD ELECTIONS TO SELECT ULEMAS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>GROUP\'S JUNE CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>DISPUTES AMONG MUSLIM FACTIONS SAID TO BE RESOLVED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MUSLIM LEADERS INSISTED THAT TENSIONS BETWEEN </p><p>ETHIOPIA\'S SHAFI AND WAHABBI MUSLIMS HAVE SUBSIDED.  THE </p><p>EMBASSY REPORTED IN 1994 THAT THE TWO GROUPS CLASHED </p><p>VIOLENTLY ON MUSLIM HOLIDAYS IN THREE CITIES NATIONWIDE. </p><p>COUNCIL LEADERS REPLIED THAT ALL ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS ARE </p><p>SUNNIS AND THAT INTERNAL DIFFERENCES ARE MINOR.  SIC </p><p>LEADERS EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT THE EMBASSY HAD EVEN </p><p>HEARD OF THE EARLIER DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THE SIC AND SHARIA COURTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE COUNCIL AND THE SHARIA COURTS ARE TWO </p><p>SEPARATE INSTITUTIONS, ALTHOUGH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>OCCASIONALLY OVERLAP.  THE SHARIA COURTS WERE ORIGINALLY </p><p>ESTABLISHED UNDER HAILE SELASSIE AND WERE EMPOWERED TO </p><p>OVERSEE ISLAMIC ISSUES CONCERNING MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, </p><p>WILLS AND TESTAMENTS, AND THE CARE AND GUARDIANSHIP OF </p><p>MINOR CHILDREN.  THE 1994 CONSTITUTION REAFFIRMS THESE </p><p>RIGHTS.  BECAUSE THE COUNCIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>ISSUES, THE LEADERS TOLD POLOFF THEIR ROLE IS TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT ONLY QUALIFIED MEMBERS SERVE ON THE COURTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ISLAMIC LEADERS HOPE TO REBUILD THE SHARIA COURT </p><p>SYSTEM.  THEY ALLEGE THAT UNDER THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL </p><p>LEADERSHIP SHARIA COURT JUDGES, WHO HOLD OFFICE FOR LIFE, </p><p>WERE SELECTED BASED ON NEPOTISM AND BRIBERY, RATHER THAN </p><p>FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS EXPERTISE.  AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER </p><p>OF SHARIA COURTS DWINDLED AND THEIR ROLE IN ETHIOPIAN </p><p>MUSLIM SOCIETY DIMINISHED ACCORDINGLY.  COUNCIL LEADERS </p><p>HOPE TO CREATE A FUNCTIONING SHARIA COURT IN EVERY </p><p>DISTRICT IN ETHIOPIA (COMMENT.  THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX </p><p>HUNDRED DISTRICTS NATIONWIDE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>GFDRE IS FUNDING SHARIA COURTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  USING THE AMHARA REGIONAL STATE AS AN EXAMPLE, </p><p>THE MUSLIM LEADERS SAID THEY HAVE PETITIONED THE REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT THERE FOR MONEY TO HIRE 118 SHARIA COURT </p><p>JUDGES.  SELECTION IS BASED ON A RIGOROUS WRITTEN </p><p>NATIONAL EXAMINATION.  FIFTY HAVE ASSUMED OFFICE AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL EXPECTS THE REMAINDER TO BE HIRED AFTER THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR IN JULY.  ASKED WHY A </p><p>SECULAR GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR RELIGIOUS JUDGES, THE </p><p>LEADERS REPLIED THAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION SHARIA COURTS </p><p>PROVIDE A JUDICIAL SERVICE AND ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>TO THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE.  (COMMENT:  SHARIA COURTS </p><p>HAVE JURISDICTION ONLY IN SPECIFIED FAMILY DISPUTES </p><p>BETWEEN MUSLIMS, AND CAN ONLY BE EMPLOYED WITH THE </p><p>CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>MUSLIM LEADERS BELIEVE PROPERTY WILL BE RETURNED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL IS WORKING CLOSELY </p><p>WITH ETHIOPIAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO RECOVER PROPERTY </p><p>SEIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN DECADES PAST.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>OFFICIALS OF THE DERG REGIME PERMITTED THE SIC TO FILE TO </p><p>RECOVER LAND AND PROPERTY TAKEN AROUND ADDIS ABABA\'S </p><p>GRAND MOSQUE, THE APPLICATIONS SAT FOR TEN YEARS WITHOUT </p><p>RESULT.  THE KEY PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO COUNCIL LEADERS, </p><p>WAS A TOTAL LACK OF RECORDS.  OVER THE PAST YEAR, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE GROUP HAS WORKED WITH THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE AND THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, TO INTERVIEW </p><p>LOCAL RESIDENTS TO ESTABLISH PROPERTY RIGHTS.  A JOINT </p><p>COMMITTEE REPORT IS IMMINENT AND THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY </p><p>EXPECTS TO RECOVER SOME OF ITS FORMER PROPERTY SOON. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>ONLY LIMITED CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM COMMUNITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE SUPREME COUNCIL\'S </p><p>CONTACTS WITH VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM GROUPS.  THE </p><p>MUSLIM LEADERS SAID THEY HAVE HAD LIMITED CONTACT WITH </p><p>THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE.  THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK </p><p>RECENTLY OFFERED TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS OF </p><p>ENGINEERING, MEDICINE, AND AGRICULTURE.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THE MUSLIM LEADERS INSISTED THAT THEIR FIRST PRIORITY HAS </p><p>BEEN TO CREATE INTERNAL LINKS TO ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS. </p><p>EXPANDING CONTACTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM </p><p>COMMUNITY IS A SECONDARY GOAL. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  SOME MONEY IS ARRIVING FROM ABROAD.  THE NUMBER </p><p>OF MOSQUES IN ETHIOPIA DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, </p><p>FUNDED IN LARGE PART BY PRIVATE MONEY FROM SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>(REF E).  PRIVATE SAUDI BUSINESSMAN MOHAMMED AL-AMOUDI </p><p>HAS BUILT SEVERAL MOSQUES AND KORANIC SCHOOLS, INCLUDING </p><p>A NEW COMPLEX IN THE AFAR REGIONAL STATE.  WHEN </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASKED LOCAL RESIDENTS IN HOSAINA, A ZONAL </p><p>CAPITAL IN THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE\'S REGION, WHO WAS </p><p>FINANCING CONSTRUCTION OF A HUGE, NEW MOSQUE, THE LOCALS </p><p>PROFESSED NOT TO KNOW.  THE EMBASSY HAS NO REPORTS OF </p><p>LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>MUSLIM RELATIONS WITH CHRISTIANS ARE GENERALLY HARMONIOUS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY HAS HISTORICALLY </p><p>FELT MARGINALIZED AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY RULING </p><p>CHRISTIAN GOVERNMENTS.  PREVIOUS ETHIOPIAN REGIMES </p><p>SUBSIDIZED THE CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHICH </p><p>CLAIMS MEMBERSHIP OF ROUGHLY HALF OF ETHIOPIA\'S </p><p>POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH TENSIONS OCCASIONALLY FLARE UP </p><p>BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, THE COUNCIL ASSURED </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICERS THAT THE TWO COMMUNITIES LIVE IN </p><p>PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.  THE PATRIARCH OF THE ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH HAS AGREED WITH THAT ASSESSMENT, WITH THE SOLE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF ADDIS ABABA, WHERE THE CRUSH OF URBAN LIFE </p><p>SOMETIMES BRINGS THE TWO GROUPS INTO CONFLICT (REF C). </p><p>CHRISTIAN ELDERS IN THE AMHARA REGIONAL STATE ECHOED THE </p><p>COMMENTS OF THE COUNCIL LEADERS.  THEY TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN FEBRUARY THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH RELIGIONS </p><p>HAVE LIVED PEACEFULLY FOR CENTURIES AND HAVE EVOLVED </p><p>MECHANISMS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.  INTERMARRIAGE IS NOT </p><p>UNCOMMON AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND FAMILIES WITH </p><p>PRACTICING CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS UNDER THE SAME ROOF. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN ELDERS REPORTED MINOR </p><p>QUARRELS, BUT NO SERIOUS VIOLENCE, OVER THE AGGRESSIVE </p><p>EVANGELICAL TACTICS OF TWO NEW ARRIVALS:  JEHOVAH\'S </p><p>WITNESSES AND PENTACOSTALS (REF D).  DURING THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S EXTENSIVE TRAVELS IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS, </p><p>HE USUALLY ASKS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS ALIKE ABOUT </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.  THE VERDICT IS </p><p>UNANIMOUS; THEY GET ALONG TOGETHER FINE AND THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS TOLERANT OF BOTH GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SIC:  NO PLACE FOR AL-ITTIHAD IN ETHIOPIA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  COUNCIL MEMBERS DENOUNCED THE MILITANT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP, AL-ITTIHAD, AND PREDICTED THE GROUP </p><p>WOULD WIN FEW SUPPORTERS AMONG ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM </p><p>POPULATION.  THE LEADERS REMINDED US THAT THEY WENT ON </p><p>TELEVISION IN JANUARY AND CONDEMNED ALL TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p>COUNCIL LEADERS CONTENDED THAT SINCE THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT THEIR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS ARE </p><p>PROTECTED UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE EXTREMIST </p><p>MESSAGE HAS LITTLE APPEAL.  THE LEADERS ALSO ACCUSED AL- </p><p>ITTIHAD OF MISINTERPRETING THE KORAN AND PREYING ON </p><p>IGNORANT MUSLIMS WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RELIGION. </p><p>THE GROWING PRESENCE OF TRAINED ULEMAS WILL UNDERMINE AL- </p><p>ITTIHAD\'S EXTREMIST MESSAGE, THEY BELIEVE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>PM MELES SAYS AL-ITTIHAD A TROJAN HORSE FOR TERRORISTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  PRIME MINISTER MELES ZENAWI HAS A LESS SANGUINE </p><p>VIEW OF THE MILITANT FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HE HAS FREQUENTLY </p><p>STATED THAT A STATELESS SOMALIA POSES THE GREATEST LONG- </p><p>TERM SECURITY THREAT TO ETHIOPIA AND TO THE STABILITY OF </p><p>THE REGION.  MELES FEARS THAT SOMALIA MAY BECOME A BASE </p><p>AND SAFE HAVEN FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS, CRIMINALS, </p><p>AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ESPECIALLY AS THE WELCOME MAT FOR </p><p>SUCH GROUPS IS WITHDRAWN FROM MORE TRADITIONAL LOCATIONS. </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER HAS WARNED THAT AL-ITTIHAD HAS BECOME </p><p>"A TROJAN HORSE FOR ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST GROUPS" AND </p><p>THAT "SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERESTIMATING AL-ITTIHAD </p><p>BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS A PURELY SOMALI ENDEAVOR." </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  THE PRIME MINISTER BELIEVES THAT AL-ITTIHAD </p><p>DRAWS SUPPORT FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT IS THE </p><p>ONLY ORGANIZED GROUP IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE NEEDED </p><p>GOODS AND SERVICES IN REMOTE DESTITUTE AREAS.  THE </p><p>EXTREMISTS RECEIVE FINANCIAL AND OTHER SUPPORT FROM IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, SUDAN, LIBYA, AND PRIVATE DONORS IN SEVERAL GULF </p><p>STATES.  TO COUNTER THE EXTREMISTS, MELES WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>SEE THE CREATION OF A FIREWALL ALONG THE ETHIO-SOMALI </p><p>BORDER THROUGH THE PROVISION OF CROSS-BORDER HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC GROUPS INSIDE SOMALIA. </p><p>THE ETHIOPIAN MILITARY CONDUCTS AGGRESSIVE PATROLLING TO </p><p>COUNTER AL-ITTIHAD\'S LIMITED MILITARY ACTIVITIES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>GFDRE FOCUSED ON STABILITY IN SOMALIA AND SOMALI REGION </p><p>OF ETHIOPIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  VIRTUALLY ALL SOMALIS ARE MUSLIM.  THE GFDRE </p><p>HAS DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT SCARCE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS </p><p>SOMALI ISSUES.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MOVED QUICKLY TO </p><p>MOBILIZE DONORS TO ASSESS THE SOMALI REGION\'S </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF DROUGHT </p><p>AND FAMINE THERE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING INSTABILITY </p><p>IN SOMALIA, ETHIOPIA HOSTED THE SODERE PEACE AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE THAT ATTRACTED 26 SOMALI POLITICAL </p><p>FACTIONS, AND THE GFDRE HAS EMBARKED ON A MAJOR </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO OBTAIN DONOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>SUSTAIN THE SODERE PROCESS.  SINCE EARLY 1995 THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED PEACE AND RECONCILIATION TALKS </p><p>BETWEEN FEUDING ETHIO-SOMALI CLANS.  TO REINFORCE ITS </p><p>NEUTRALITY, THE EPRDF HAS PUT OFF AN APPLICATION FOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP BY THE ETHIOPIAN SOMALI DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE </p><p>WHICH NOW RUNS THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>OTHER MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUPS INACTIVE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C)  OTHER DOMESTIC RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS HAVE </p><p>SLIPPED INTO OBSCURITY.  THE ISLAMIC FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF OROMIYA, IN THE EARLY 1990\'S THE MOST </p><p>ACTIVE ETHIOPIAN ISLAMIC RADICAL GROUP, HAS FADED FROM </p><p>THE SCENE.  THE MILITANT WING OF THE OGADEN NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION FRONT HAS CONFINED ITS ACTIVITIES TO </p><p>PERIODICALLY APPEALING FOR FUNDS FROM SAFE POSITIONS IN </p><p>EXILE AND FORWARDING PROTEST LETTERS TO WESTERN EMBASSIES </p><p>IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MUSLIM "MAN-ON-THE-STREET" GENERALLY SATISFIED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C)  DESPITE OCCASIONAL CRITICISM OF SELECT </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IN GOVERNMENT, THE EMBASSY\'S MUSLIM CONTACTS </p><p>ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY INSIST THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>THE GFDRE AND REPORT THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE </p><p>OPEN.  EVEN IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED SOMALI STATE, WHERE </p><p>CITIZENS ARE FRUSTRATED WITH AN INEFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY </p><p>CORRUPT REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, MOST CITIZENS BLAME THE </p><p>REGIONAL PRESIDENT - NOT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES - FOR THE </p><p>LACK OF DEVELOPMENT.  MOST EXPECT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>INTERVENE TO ASSIST THE REGION AND MANY PRAISE THE GFDRE </p><p>FOR SENDING TRAINING TEAMS TO THE REGION AND FOR INVITING </p><p>THE REGION\'S ADMINISTRATORS TO VISIT OTHER REGIONAL </p><p>STATES TO OBSERVE AND LEARN. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C)  THE ATTITUDE OF MUSLIMS IN THE AFAR REGION IS </p><p>POSITIVE.  MUSLIM ELDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>IN THE AFAR REGIONAL STATE RECENTLY EXPRESSED THEIR </p><p>SATISFACTION TO US WITH THE GFDRE POLICIES OF </p><p>DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONALIZATION.  WITH THE CREATION </p><p>OF THE AFAR STATE IN 1995, MUSLIM AFARS FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN ETHIOPIAN HISTORY FEEL THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR OWN </p><p>DESTINY WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM CHRISTIAN HIGHLANDERS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>ISLAM GROWNG FASTER THAN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOXY? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>22. (C)  WE ARE HEARING ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT THE </p><p>GROWTH OF ISLAM IN ETHIOPIA MAY BE OUTPACING THAT OF </p><p>NEW ADHERENTS TO THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN </p><p>FACT, MOST MUSLIMS TODAY DISPUTE THE CONVENTIONAL </p><p>WISDOM THAT 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS MOSLEM AND </p><p>50 PERCENT ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX WITH THE REMAINING 10 </p><p>PERCENT PROTESTANT, CATHOLIC AND ANIMIST.  THE PAPAL </p><p>NUNCIO HAS TAKEN A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE ETHIOPIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH AND HAS HAD A NUMBER OF FRANK </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHURCH HIERARCHY.  ETHIOPIAN </p><p>ORTHODOXY IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS CONSERVATISM AND LACK </p><p>OF PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.  MOST OF THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP </p><p>ALSO FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY.  THOSE FEW WHO WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO MODERNIZE THE CHURCH HAVE CONFIDED TO THE PAPAL </p><p>NUNCIO THAT THE CHURCH IS HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY </p><p>OBTAINING THE ALLEGIANCE OF YOUNG ETHIOPIANS.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, THERE IS STRONG RESISTANCE WITHIN THE CHURCH </p><p>TO MODERNIZE.  THE MORE ENLIGHTENED LEADERS FEAR THIS </p><p>IS GOING TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THE STATISTICAL </p><p>BREAKDOWN BETWEEN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX AND MUSLIMS IN THE </p><p>COMING YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C)  WHILE THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH MAY WELL </p><p>BE FACING VERY SLOW GROWTH, WE SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT IS </p><p>THE CASE FOR THE MUSLIM POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>STATISTICS ARE LACKING, THE NUMBER OF NEW MOSQUES UNDER </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION BASED ON OUR TRAVEL AROUND </p><p>THE COUNTRY SUGGEST THAT ISLAM IS ADDING TO ITS NUMBERS </p><p>WITH EASE.  WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT PROTESTANT GROUPS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE MODERATE EVANGELICAL MEKANE YESUS AND </p><p>PENTECOSTALS ARE ALSO GROWING RAPIDLY.  BUT THEIR </p><p>GROWTH COMES FROM A MUCH SMALLER BASE, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>PENTECOSTALS.  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SITUATION FOR </p><p>THE FUTURE IS CLEAR.  SHOULD MUSLIMS BECOME IN THE NOT </p><p>DISTANT FUTURE A MAJORITY, WHICH IS A REAL POSSIBILITY, </p><p>IT WILL EVENTUALLY CHANGE THE POLITICAL DYNAMIC OF </p><p>ETHIOPIA.  BECAUSE THE MUSLIMS ARE POLITICALLY DIVIDED </p><p>AND TEND TO RESIDE IN THE PERIPHERY AS OPPOSED TO THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS OF ETHIOPIA, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ANYTIME SOON.  BUT WE DO NEED TO </p><p>BE ALERT TO THE CHANGING DYNAMIC HERE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C)  ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIMS NOW ENJOY BETTER TREATMENT </p><p>THAN AT ANY TIME IN THEIR LENGTHY HISTORY, THIS DESPITE </p><p>THE GFDRE\'S DEEP CONCERN OVER THE SPREAD OF MUSLIM </p><p>EXTREMISM WHICH, IT BELIEVES, IS SUPPORTED BY RADICAL </p><p>ELEMENTS IN KHARTOUM AND BY WEALTHY PRIVATE INTERESTS IN </p><p>THE GULF STATES. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C)  THE GFDRE APPEARS DETERMINED TO UNDERMINE THE </p><p>THREAT OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>MAINSTREAM MUSLIMS AND BY CLOSELY MONITORING RADICAL </p><p>GROUPS IN NEIGHBORING SOMALIA AND SUDAN.  NO MILITANT </p><p>GROUP POSES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE GFDRE AT THIS </p><p>TIME, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL ARE CAPABLE OF ISOLATED TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS.  NEVERTHELESS, AS LONG AS AL-ITTIHAD RECEIVES </p><p>OUTSIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ENJOYS SAFE HAVENS IN </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, THE ETHIOPIAN MILITARY CANNOT </p><p>COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE EXTREMISTS.  SIMILARLY, UNTIL </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL POWER-SHARING ISSUES ARE RESOLVED AMONG </p><p>COMPETING ETHIO-SOMALI CLANS, THE EXTREMISTS WILL BE ABLE </p><p>TO CAPITALIZE ON ANY RESULTING DISSATISFACTION. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C)  THE RADICAL ISLAMIC MESSAGE HAS LITTLE APPEAL </p><p>FOR MOST ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS.  ONLY IN PERIPHERAL AREAS </p><p>WHERE THE FLEDGING REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE YET TO MAKE </p><p>AN IMPACT ON THE OFTEN DESPERATE POPULATION ARE THE </p><p>EXTREMISTS MAKING LIMITED HEADWAY.  HUNGRY AND THIRSTY </p><p>PEOPLE ACT TO SURVIVE, RARELY OUT OF TRUE DEDICATION TO </p><p>THE MILITANT CAUSE.  NEITHER AL-ITTIHAD NOR OTHER </p><p>MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE ISLAMIC FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF OROMIA HAVE ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (C)  THE NEW SIC IS BUSILY TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR </p><p>YEARS OF NEGLECT AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY ARE PLEASED WITH </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT AND ARE ENJOYING </p><p>THEIR NEW-FOUND FREEDOM TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION </p><p>WITHOUT INTERFERENCE, BUT ARE HAMPERED BY A LACK OF MONEY </p><p>AND A SERIOUSLY DETERIORATED MUSLIM INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>28.  (C)  AFTER HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF LIVING TOGETHER IN </p><p>RELATIVE ISOLATION, THERE ARE FEW BURNING ISSUES THAT </p><p>DIVIDE ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AND </p><p>FEWER STILL THAT ARE LIKELY TO PROVOKE VIOLENT CLASHES </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHINN </p><p></p></div>
