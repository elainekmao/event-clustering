<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, SOCI, KISL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) HOW THE WAR COULD AFFECT KUWAIT POLITICALLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 974 EXDIS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY:  Reftel examined how a </p><p>US-led war against Saddam\'s regime could affect US relations </p><p>with Kuwait.  This message looks at the closely-related topic </p><p>of the political effects the war could have on Kuwait itself. </p><p> In both cases, the answer is highly scenario-dependent.  If </p><p>we win quickly and relatively cleanly, and the new Iraq </p><p>rapidly emerges as a friendly, responsible state, Kuwait will </p><p>probably come under relatively little pressure to change </p><p>course, and liberal, pro-American elements may be </p><p>strengthened.  On the other hand, if stiff Iraqi resistance </p><p>drags out the conflict and produces massive civilian </p><p>casualties, Kuwait will face widespread condemnation as a </p><p>traitor to the Arab/Muslim world for having served as our </p><p>main launching pad.  The regime could feel compelled to </p><p>bolster its Arab and Muslim credentials by promoting more of </p><p>the Islamist agenda.  We assess that the Kuwaitis will not </p><p>break with us no matter how the war goes, unless they were to </p><p>conclude that we were about to leave them at Saddam\'s mercy. </p><p>Even if the war goes well, though, the Kuwaitis will feel </p><p>more vindicated than beholden to us.  END INTRODUCTION AND </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PERCEPTIONS RULE:  The outcome of the war to remove </p><p>Saddam\'s regime and eliminate its WMD programs will </p><p>eventually make itself clear, but in the meantime, we can </p><p>expect perceptions to range all over the map, mostly in </p><p>negative directions.  No matter how inaccurate or unfair, </p><p>perceptions determine reactions.  Kuwaitis\' perceptions may </p><p>be vulnerable to change because of unrealistically high </p><p>initial expectations:  they have been telling themselves that </p><p>the Iraqis hate the dictator so much they would not fight, </p><p>and that our military might is so overwhelming that we would </p><p>sweep into Baghdad in no time, with negligible casualties. </p><p>This Embassy is tracking not only the Kuwaitis\' own </p><p>perceptions about the war, but the effect on them of </p><p>prevailing perceptions in the wider Arab world.  There, if </p><p>not here, we expect to see an inverse relationship between </p><p>the degree to which the Iraqis put up a fight and the </p><p>credibility of our claim to be liberators (never mind that </p><p>this equation is a fallacy as long as only the regime </p><p>resists, not the population).  We also expect to see (in the </p><p>larger Arab world, but not here) a direct relationship </p><p>between the amount of perceived harm the Iraqis do to us and </p><p>Saddam\'s standing as a warrior hero. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  OPTIMIST\'S SCENARIO:  If the war ends well, Kuwait </p><p>will be adequately insulated against criticism in the </p><p>Arab/Muslim world.  In the best case, US influence in Kuwait </p><p>will grow, liberals in this country will be strengthened, and </p><p>they may increase their representation in the National </p><p>Assembly (elections are due by mid-July).  This optimistic </p><p>scenario offers the best chance for progress on women\'s </p><p>rights (Kuwaiti women can neither vote nor run in National </p><p>Assembly elections; in 2000, the Assembly narrowly rejected </p><p>an Amiri decree enfranchising them).  However, even </p><p>spectacular success in the war will not guarantee liberal </p><p>ascendancy.  Liberals are disunited, and they are -- almost </p><p>by definition -- vulnerable to being stigmatized as </p><p>anti-Islamic. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) How Iraq evolves after the war will also affect </p><p>Kuwait.  If the new Iraqi government is seen as democratic, </p><p>successful, and friendly, the advocates of democracy and </p><p>women\'s rights in this country will be heartened.  At the </p><p>moment, with everybody in crisis mode, we detect no </p><p>groundswell of demand for greater democracy in this small </p><p>oil-rich emirate.  Indeed, by Gulf standards, Kuwait is </p><p>exceptionally open, with a lively private press and </p><p>rambunctious National Assembly.  Even so, it is not only </p><p>women who are disenfranchised:  most male citizens also lack </p><p>the right to vote.  While Iraq does not have much of a </p><p>democratic tradition, its women do already have the right to </p><p>vote, and that could serve as a positive example for Kuwait. </p><p>In fact, more than one young Kuwaiti including members of the </p><p>al-Sabah, have told us that they are hoping to be able to use </p><p>a newly democratic Iraq as an example to spur reform in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THANKS, AND YOU\'RE WELCOME:  We assess that after the </p><p>war, the Kuwaitis will feel vindicated more than beholden to </p><p>us.  After all, they contributed greatly to our preparations </p><p>for Operation Iraqi Freedom and have put their collective </p><p>neck on the line by allowing us to use their country as the </p><p>launching pad for this major, internationally controversial </p><p>war against an Arab state.  The relative lack of cooperation </p><p>from Saudi Arabia and Turkey underscores both the value and </p><p>the courage of Kuwait\'s role.  In addition, the GOK is </p><p>providing a very great deal of Assistance-In-Kind to our </p><p>military.  The Government/ruling family will expect us to </p><p>recognize these contributions which are already approaching </p><p>USD one billion; and they will expect us to treat them as a </p><p>full partner.  Unlike after the Gulf War, they will not feel </p><p>a need to make promises on internal political reform.  We </p><p>also see no prospect of Kuwait becoming more active in the </p><p>Arab-Israeli peace process.  Here as in other Arab states </p><p>friendly to us, the population is less supportive of the </p><p>peace process than the regime is.  The GOK will look to us to </p><p>achieve real progress towards a solution satisfactory to the </p><p>Palestinian people (independent state with some part of </p><p>Jerusalem as its capital, knowing that that would help its </p><p>standing in the Arab world).  We can expect it to play a </p><p>quietly supportive role within Arab councils if the situation </p><p>seems promising, but we anticipate that it will remain </p><p>reluctant to get ahead of Saudi Arabia with regard to </p><p>normalization with Israel.  Financial support for any </p><p>Palestinian government involving Yasir Arafat would also be a </p><p>very tough sell here. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)   PESSIMIST\'S SCENARIO:  If the war were to go badly, </p><p>Kuwait would find itself in a very awkward position:  it </p><p>would feel great pressure to assert its Arab and Muslim </p><p>credentials, but it would also want to ensure our continued </p><p>protection.  We expect Kuwait to stay as close as possible to </p><p>Saudi Arabia, its next-door neighbor to the south, the de </p><p>facto leader of the GCC and a state that has longstanding </p><p>strategic relations with us even though it does not share </p><p>some of our values.  (Notwithstanding historical animosity, </p><p>since the Gulf War Kuwait has become closer to the Saudis </p><p>than any other GCC state.)  The Islamists, particularly the </p><p>Salafis (first cousins of Saudi Arabia\'s Wahabis), would be </p><p>emboldened. Liberals would be on the defensive.  The general </p><p>trend is already in that direction, even without the war.  A </p><p>law requiring classes at Kuwait University to be segregated </p><p>by gender on the books for several years is being enforced as </p><p>of this academic year.  Plans are afoot to move female </p><p>students off the main campus, even though they constitute 70 </p><p>percent of the student body. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) U.S. RESOLVE:  We assess that the Kuwaitis would not </p><p>break with us no matter how badly the war went, because the </p><p>more their partnership with us brought heat on them, the more </p><p>they would need protection, and no other nation but the US </p><p>will be there to provide it.  The one thing that could split </p><p>them from us would be a perception that we were about to </p><p>leave them at Saddam\'s mercy.  That would be their worst </p><p>nightmare (and Saddam\'s propaganda machine is working </p><p>overtime to keep it vividly before them).  At this stage, we </p><p>do not sense much live questioning of our resolve, but </p><p>psychologists manning Kuwaiti hotlines reportedly already </p><p>have some callers expressing worries about it.  Embassy works </p><p>overtime to counter such notions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TCNs:  Under the "Optimist\'s Scenario," we did not </p><p>even mention the TCNs who constitute the majority of Kuwait\'s </p><p>population.  They are normally quiescent; any involvement in </p><p>protests would jeopardize their job security.  The TCNs </p><p>include hundreds of thousands of Arabs, with Egyptians </p><p>constituting by far the largest group.  We certainly cannot </p><p>exclude the possibility of subversive agitation surfacing </p><p>within this community, which could further complicate </p><p>Kuwait\'s delicate relationship with the Arab world.  Also, if </p><p>certain Arab governments become excessively hostile, the GOK </p><p>could retaliate by expelling large numbers of their </p><p>nationals.  (Syria has already made some inflammatory </p><p>statements; it has tens of thousands of nationals here.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) PARTING THOUGHT:  The Kuwaitis are the one people in </p><p>the Arab world whose first-hand experience of Iraqi brutality </p><p>makes them impervious to the Saddam mystique.  The more </p><p>Saddam becomes a hero to other Arabs, the deeper the rift </p><p>will be.  The more successful we are, the less Kuwait will </p><p>have to do to mend fences, but the harder certain other Arab </p><p>states will find it to mend fences with Kuwait. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
