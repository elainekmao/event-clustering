(C) ALMOST ALL OF CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS HAVE PUBLICLY </p><p>BACKED THE GOC DECISION NOT TO SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION IN </p><p>IRAQ ABSENT A NEW UNSC RESOLUTION (REFTEL).  POLITICAL UNITY </p><p>IN CROATIA IS A GENUINE RARITY.  SOME LEADING GOVERNMENT </p><p>FIGURES WANT TO TRY TO CATCH WHAT THEY THINK IS A WAVE OF </p><p>LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE GOC\'S DECISION TO SAY "NO" TO THE USG </p><p>AND ARE CROWING ABOUT THEIR "BRAVE" DECISION.  OTHER </p><p>POLITICAL OBSERVERS ARE DUMBFOUNDED BY THE GOC DECISION AND </p><p>BY ITS MANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  THEY ARE WONDERING WHY </p><p>CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE MISSING ANOTHER EXCELLENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SHUT UP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MESIC: US ACTION WOULD HAVE QUESTIONABLE LEGITIMACY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) PRESIDENT MESIC, IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN </p><p>"SLOBODNA DALMACIJA" ON MARCH 19, TOOK A HARD </p><p>INTERNATIONALIST LINE.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. "DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>THE UN CHARTER FRAMEWORK CALLS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ACTION </p><p>INTO QUESTION."  HE SAID THAT U.S. ACTION WOULD CREATE A </p><p>PRECEDENT WHEREBY A COUNTRY THAT IS "NOT AMERICA, SOMEONE WHO </p><p>IS STRONGER THAN THEIR NEIGHBOR, CAN IMPOSE THEIR SOLUTIONS" </p><p>AND CITED CROATIA\'S EXPERIENCE WITH MILOSEVIC.  MESIC </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER CROATIA NEEDS "THIS KIND OF NATO." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00631  01 OF 02  191658Z </p><p> </p><p>DPM GRANIC: "NO" TO FUTURE USG REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC SAID THAT THE GOC </p><p>IS "CONCERNED ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS AND, OF COURSE </p><p>DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY ACTION OUTSIDE OF THE UN."  GRANIC SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOC WOULD REJECT FUTURE U.S. REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT OF </p><p>MILITARY ACTION "ACCORDING TO THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S LEADERS, WHICH IMPLICITLY STATES THAT IT MAY NOT BE </p><p>AMENDED.  I REPEAT THAT CROATIA WILL OPPOSE ANY ACTION WHICH </p><p>IS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE UN." </p><p> </p><p>SMALLER PARTIES GET ON THE BANDWAGON </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) LEADERS OF CROATIA\'S SMALLER POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE </p><p>JUMPED ON BOARD AS WELL; THEIR COMMENTS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE </p><p>MASS-MARKET DAILY "VJESNIK."  FORMER FM MATE GRANIC </p><p>(PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC CENTER - DC) DECLARED </p><p>THAT HIS PARTY DOES NOT SUPPORT MILITARY INTERVENTION WITHOUT </p><p>A NEW UNSCR BECAUSE IT WOULD DIVIDE THE COUNCIL AND </p><p>"COMPLETELY DESTABILIZE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE UN </p><p>WITH UNFORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES."  DAMIR KAJIN OF THE </p><p>REGIONAL PARTY ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (IDS) SAID THAT THE </p><p>U.S. DECISION TO GO AHEAD WITHOUT A NEW UNSCR "DELEGITIMIZES </p><p>THE ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, WHICH, LET\'S BE TRUTHFUL, AT THIS </p><p>MOMENT IS NOT THREATENING ANYONE."  HE DERIDED THE STRONG </p><p>PRO-U.S. POSITION OF THE OPPOSITION HDZ BY SAYING THAT HDZ </p><p>PRESIDENT SANADER "LOOKS LIKE HE IS RUNNING HIS ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN IN MASSACHUSETTS, NOT IN CROATIA."  HE SAID THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00631  01 OF 02  191658Z </p><p>CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE SHOWING AN "ENVIABLE LEVEL OF </p><p>UNITY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) LUKA TRCONIC, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HSS (THE </p><p>COALITION\'S SECOND-LARGEST PARTY) SAID "WE SUPPORT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSITION" BUT EXPLAINED THAT HIS PARTY "HAS </p><p>UNDERSTANDING FOR THE FRUSTRATION OF THE AMERICANS AND THEIR </p><p>DESIRE TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN."  EVEN THE FRINGE PARTIES </p><p>ARE ECHOING THE RULING COALITION.  ANTO DJAPIC, PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHT (HSP) SAID THAT "THE HSP DOES NOT </p><p>ENDORSE THE USA AND ALLIES\' ACTION IN IRAQ WHICH IS NOT </p><p>BACKED BY A RESOLUTION OF THE UNSC.  THE MOTIVES FOR THE USA </p><p>AND ALLIES TO ATTACK IRAQ ARE NOT IDEALS, BUT RAW INTERESTS </p><p>OF A GREAT POWER.  (COMMENT: PM RACAN SHOULD BE WORRIED, NOT </p><p>COMFORTED BY THE SUPPORT OF THIS PARTY OF RIGHT-WING </p><p>EXTREMISTS.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENTATOR: WHY COULDN\'T WE JUST BE QUIET? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) WHILE MOST POLITICAL COMMENTATORS HERE HAVE -- </p><p>TYPICALLY -- FOCUSED ONLY ON THE EFFECT OF THE GOC DECISION </p><p>AS IF IT HAD NO EFFECT OUTSIDE OF CROATIA, BRUNO LOPANDIC, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1622 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00631  02 OF 02  191658Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MFLO-03  NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------471418  191658Z /38 </p><p>O 191700Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9772 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000631 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) AND EUR/PA/PD (HORNBUCKLE) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, KMDR, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIA: POLITICIANS BACK GOC OPPOSITION </p><p>TO MILITARY ACTION WITHOUT NEW UNSCR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00631  02 OF 02  191658Z </p><p>"VJESNIK\'S" LEADING FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, LAMENTS THE </p><p>GOC\'S "PERILOUS SYNDROME OF REACTING OFFICIALLY TO UNOFFICIAL </p><p>RUMORS."  "FOR THE MOST PART, EUROPE IS SILENT, EXCEPT FOR </p><p>CROATIA."  CROATIA WILL NOT PLAY ANY ROLE IN THE DECISION TO </p><p>ATTACK IRAQ AND ITS "EUROPEAN CLAMORING" IN THE PRESS AND </p><p>PUBLIC WILL NOT DO ANY GOOD EITHER, HE WROTE IN HIS MARCH 18 </p><p>COLUMN.  HE ADDED THAT IF CROATIA\'S "NEW" POSITION TO OPPOSE </p><p>MILITARY ACTION OUTSIDE THE UN FRAMEWORK WOULD HAVE RULED OUT </p><p>NATO ATTACKS ON THE FRY.  WHILE HE AGREED WITH RACAN\'S </p><p>DECISION TO POSTPONE HIS TRIP TO LONDON, HE LAMBASTED RACAN\'S </p><p>"ILLOGICAL" DECISION TO TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT WHY.  IN </p><p>SPEAKING ABOUT CANCELLING THE VISIT, RACAN SAID THAT </p><p>\'OBVIOUSLY WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME SIDE\' ... THIS STATEMENT IS </p><p>ONE OF A SERIES OF DIPLOMATIC GAFFES WHICH ARE UNFORTUNATELY </p><p>TYPICAL FOR A CROATIAN FOREIGN POLICY BURDENED WITH </p><p>SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS AND IGNORANCE."  BOTH LOPANDIC AND AN </p><p>INTERVIEWER FROM ANOTHER NEWSPAPER EXPRESSED THE BELIEF AS </p><p>OUTLINED IN REFTEL THAT THE GOC WAS SIDING WITH FRANCE IN </p><p>ORDER TO CURRY FAVOR FOR ITS EU APPLICATION. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
