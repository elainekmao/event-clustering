<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 002393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Nepali Government Policy, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: GOVERNMENT PLAN TO APPOINT LOCAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATORS: LIKELY TO SPARK POLITICAL PROTEST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reason 1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a December 16 meeting with the Ambassador, Nepal\'s </p><p>Information and Communication Minister revealed that the </p><p>government plan to soon begin appointing government officers </p><p>to local positions.  The government\'s decision to take this </p><p>step, which will be announced via ordinance by the King in </p><p>days, was not done in consultation with Nepal\'s political </p><p>parties.  The Embassy anticipates backlash as a result.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Policy by Trial Balloon </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On December 16, the Ambassador met with Information </p><p>and Communication Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey.  During the </p><p>meeting Pandey revealed that the government will soon begin </p><p>appointing professional government bureaucrats (at the </p><p>secretary level) to head Village Development Committees </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(VDC).  The VDC is the smallest unit of government authority </p><p>and is most directly tied to the communities it serves.  In </p><p>July, the previous government allowed the terms of all local </p><p>bodies to expire, leaving local levels of government without </p><p>elected representation.  The Government of Nepal has since </p><p>appointed civil servants to carry out the functions of the </p><p>local bodies.  Maoist insurgents have destroyed 39 percent of </p><p>the total of 3912 VDC buildings in the country.  As an </p><p>extreme example, the Gulmi District has lost 92 percent of </p><p>its 79 VDC offices.  Because of Maoist terror, many of the </p><p>civil servants appointed to fill VDC posts have fled the VDCs </p><p>and relocated to district headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador encouraged the Minister to seek out the </p><p>opinions of the political parties and ensure that they are </p><p>not taken by surprise.  Minister Pandey stated that, as the </p><p>newly designated spokesperson for His Majesty\'s Government, </p><p>he had made press statements in the last several days that </p><p>hinted at the proposal.  Upon hearing no public protests to </p><p>these trial balloons, the Minister stated that the government </p><p>felt confident in adopting the proposal without communicating </p><p>directly with the political parties. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Minister expects the King to promulgate the new </p><p>ordinance in the next few days.  It will be valid for six </p><p>months and can then be renewed.  The appointed secretaries </p><p>will provide much needed services, including issuing birth </p><p>and death certificates and overseeing implementation of </p><p>projects in their village.  To be appointed, secretaries must </p><p>be residents of their village and must have graduated from </p><p>the tenth grade.  Minister Pandey stated that members of the </p><p>four political parties will be considered for appointment but </p><p>that there should be no expectation that the new appointees </p><p>will reflect the political make-up of the last election. </p><p>Ambassador Malinowski pressed Minister Pandey to consult with </p><p>the political parties. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The appointment of VDC secretaries--in the absence of </p><p>locally elected officials--for some Nepali could harken back </p><p>to the 1960-1990 "partyless" Panchayat era, when the King </p><p>appointed all levels of government.  Nepalese political </p><p>parties will likely criticize the palace move as evidence of </p><p>encroachment upon their local government prerogatives in </p><p>Nepal.  Although Pandey argued that the positions </p><p>traditionally have been filled by low level officials, the </p><p>government should use this opportunity to fill a recognized </p><p>bureacratic vacuum as a way to develop better--and much </p><p>needed--working relationships with the parties. End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
