<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000769 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/ESC, EB/TPP </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL REACTION MIXED ON NEW BURMA SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 4 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Embassy has received much solicited and </p><p>unsolicited reaction to the impending U.S. sanctions. We\'ve </p><p>heard from foreign diplomats, businessmen, resident U.S. </p><p>citizens, some NLD members, and GOB economic officials. </p><p>Generally people understand our motives, but are very </p><p>skeptical that our choice of action will prove effective. </p><p>Even the bureaucrats seem resigned to the inevitable </p><p>punishment.  The NLD members with whom we spoke support the </p><p>U.S. efforts, though they agree that sanctions imposed </p><p>without the support of ASEAN or China would not be enough to </p><p>force this regime to change its mind on political reforms. </p><p>As for American citizens, the two most specific concerns come </p><p>from long-term residents, concerned about their ability to </p><p>continue living and working here, and from U.S. exporters </p><p>with containers on the docks who are unsure whether they </p><p>should give the order to load. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Diplomats </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Both the Korean and French commercial attaches </p><p>requested meetings to discuss pending U.S. trade sanctions. </p><p>The Korean attache raised his concerns about the likely fate </p><p>of around 40 Korean investors who are running garment </p><p>factories.  Garments make up a very large portion of Burmese </p><p>exports to the United States.  He told us that most of these </p><p>investors would have to pack up and try to move on should the </p><p>U.S. market become inaccessible to them.  He said, though, </p><p>that the larger Korean investors (such as Daewoo, which has a </p><p>joint venture garment factory with the Union of Myanmar </p><p>Economic Holdings, Ltd.) would likely remain in Burma, </p><p>attempting to sell more to the European market. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The French attache was not critical of the new </p><p>possible sanctions, admitting that his government too was </p><p>considering (in the EU context) additional measures.  Both he </p><p>and his Korean colleague understood the reasons the United </p><p>States wanted to take action.  However, they both questioned </p><p>whether the import ban could damage the government when the </p><p>vast majority of garment sector factories and output is in </p><p>private sector hands.  (This is a fact, reported in reftel, </p><p>we\'ve noticed various editorials and NGO press statements </p><p>seem to misunderstand.)  Both pointed out that the import ban </p><p>would lead to factory closures and unemployment at a time of </p><p>pre-existing economic hardship. </p><p> </p><p>The Businesspeople </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Garment factory owners are understandably frightened </p><p>by the likely import ban.  They repeated their oft-heard </p><p>refrain that the garment industry contributes very little to </p><p>government coffers, employs about 100,000 workers (mostly </p><p>women), and is nearly 100 percent private sector.  However, </p><p>they understand that the root of their problems was not U.S. </p><p>sanctions, but inept GOB economic policies.  Other exporters </p><p>of products to the United States (a fishery owner and a </p><p>timber merchant) said they are not really concerned about the </p><p>ban, as their major markets are elsewhere, but scoffed at the </p><p>notion that the new sanctions would have even a psychological </p><p>effect on the country\'s policymakers. </p><p> </p><p>The US Citizens </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The economic and consular sections have been getting </p><p>a steady stream of calls from U.S. citizens concerned about </p><p>the impact of the pending import ban, and the possibility of </p><p>a travel ban.  In both sections these inquiries have followed </p><p>a familiar thread: What are the details of the new sanctions? </p><p> Will it hurt my business/ability to travel to, or live in, </p><p>Burma?  As these measures will have no impact on the regime, </p><p>why is the U.S. government imposing them? </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The two most specific concerns come from long-term </p><p>American residents in Burma, concerned about their ability to </p><p>continue living and working here, and from U.S. exporters </p><p>with containers on the docks who are unsure whether they </p><p>should give the order to load.  This latter group fears that </p><p>the sanctions will come into effect while their shipment is </p><p>en route, and Customs in the United States won\'t accept any </p><p>grandfathering.  When more details are available on these two </p><p>topics, we plan to put out a bulletin to U.S. citizens in </p><p>Burma and hold a town meeting to try and address their </p><p>concerns. </p><p> </p><p>The Opposition </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We had a chance to brief a few of the remaining free </p><p>mid-level NLD officials on the proposed U.S. sanctions. </p><p>Those with whom we spoke have little economic background, but </p><p>understand sanctions and their use as a policy tool.  They </p><p>were quite supportive of sanctions as a gesture of U.S. </p><p>displeasure with the SPDC and its recent actions.  The </p><p>officials opined that the psychological impact on the regime </p><p>would outweigh the comparatively minor economic damage and </p><p>unemployment (100,000 workers out of a workforce of roughly </p><p>10-20 million) that would be caused by the new sanctions. </p><p>The NLD members support the U.S. efforts, though they agreed </p><p>that sanctions imposed without the support of ASEAN or China </p><p>would not be enough to force this regime to change its mind </p><p>on political reforms. </p><p> </p><p>The Government </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) We also discussed impending sanctions with officials </p><p>of one of the state-owned trade banks, and of the </p><p>GOB-affiliated Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of </p><p>Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI).  The UMFCCI official, </p><p>representing Burmese private sector interests, told us he and </p><p>most of the UMFCCI membership understood the motivation for </p><p>sanctions, and who was really to blame for Burma\'s dismal </p><p>business climate.  He quizzed us carefully on what, if </p><p>anything, could stop the rush toward an import ban.  We told </p><p>him that at this point, nothing short of a significant and </p><p>irreversible step toward political transition (i.e., more </p><p>than just the release of ASSK) would change the direction of </p><p>U.S. policy.  We advised him to use UMFCCI\'s limited, but </p><p>existent, lobbying power with the SPDC to try and convince </p><p>the regime to take these steps if it wanted a chance to stave </p><p>off the new sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The banker asked for an explanation of all of the </p><p>pending sanctions, but did not seem surprised at our actions. </p><p> He asked us to keep him apprised of the changing situation, </p><p>particularly as regards the asset freeze, as the two </p><p>state-owned foreign trade banks (Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank </p><p>and Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank) both have some </p><p>assets remaining in accounts at their U.S. correspondent </p><p>banks.  He said that the bank had not noticed any slowdown in </p><p>the number of Letters of Credit requests at the bank, but </p><p>that he\'d heard several bank customers complaining of </p><p>canceled export orders from the United States and Europe. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
