SUMMARY:  THE EUROPEAN UNION OBSERVER MISSION ISSUED AN </p><p>INTERIM STATEMENT ON ZIMBABWE\'S JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS AT MIDNIGHT ON JUNE 25-26.  THE REPORT COVERS THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION PERIOD AND THE VOTING; A LATER REPORT WILL </p><p>COVER THE VOTE COUNT AND THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD.  THE EU </p><p>DETERMINED THAT: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE VOTED IN LARGE NUMBERS, SHOWING </p><p>DETERMINATION TO INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY </p><p>DESPITE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- ELECTORAL OFFICIALS DID NOT OPERATE IN AN OPEN AND </p><p>TRANSPARENT MANNER, AND AS A RESULT FAILED TO SECURE THE </p><p>CONFIDENCE OF BOTH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND OF THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- ADMINISTRATIVE OBSTRUCTIONS IMPEDED THE WORK OF DOMESTIC </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THIS WAS "NOT DUE TO </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE BUT TO A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO </p><p>REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEPENDENT MONITORING OF THE </p><p>ELECTION." </p><p> </p><p>-- HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION, AND COERCION, </p><p>PARTICULARLY BY ZANU-PF, MARRED THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. </p><p>"ZANU-PF LEADERS SEEMED TO SANCTION THE USE OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CONTRIBUTED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CLIMATE OF FEAR SO EVIDENT DURING THE </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN." </p><p> </p><p>-- EU OBSERVERS\' "OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLLING IS </p><p>HIGHLY POSITIVE."  HOWEVER, THERE WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03482  01 OF 03  261435Z </p><p>THE VOTERS\' ROLL AND A LARGE NUMBER OF INTENDING VOTERS WERE </p><p>UNABLE TO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE EU STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE ELECTIONS 2000 </p><p> </p><p>INTERIM STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>PIERRE SCHORI </p><p>HEAD OF EU ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE VOTED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN THIS </p><p>WEEKEND\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. DESPITE A HIGH LEVEL OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND SERIOUS </p><p>FLAWS AND IRREGULARITIES IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, THEY HAVE </p><p>SHOWN A CLEAR DETERMINATION TO INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY -- BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND THROUGH THE STRUCTURES OF </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE CO-OPERATED </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY SINCE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>IN 1980. THE EU IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE. AS AN ACT OF COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE EU DEPLOYED SOME 190 EXPERIENCED EU OBSERVERS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER </p><p>MISSION, WITH THE AIM OF CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE FAVOURABLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03482  01 OF 03  261435Z </p><p>CLIMATE FOR THE ELECTIONS. WE SEE OUR PRESENCE HERE AS A </p><p>NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THE STRUGGLE FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE; AND WE WISH TO BUILD A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH </p><p>A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>EU OBSERVERS WERE IN GENERAL WARMLY WELCOMED. THEY </p><p>ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES, LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THEY ATTENDED SOME ONE </p><p>HUNDRED POLITICAL RALLIES.  THE EU MISSION ALSO BENEFITED </p><p>FROM CO-OPERATION WITH THE MONITORS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVER MISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE EU ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS FALLS INTO THREE PHASES: THE ELECTION </p><p>PREPARATIONS AND CAMPAIGN; VOTING AND THE COUNT; AND THE </p><p>POST-ELECTION PERIOD. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE PRESENTED ON 3 </p><p>JULY 2000. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD AND THE CAMPAIGN </p><p> </p><p>IT IS CLEAR FROM THE DAILY REPORTS AND WEEKLY ASSESSMENTS </p><p>MADE BY EU OBSERVERS IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT THERE </p><p>WERE SERIOUS FLAWS AND FAILURES IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8688 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03482  02 OF 03  261435Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------670688  261436Z /38 </p><p>O 261439Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6437 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003482 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S RICE, P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

THE EU </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT </p><p>THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE BUT TO A </p><p>DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF </p><p>INDEPENDENT MONITORING OF THE ELECTION. SIMILAR OBSTRUCTIONS </p><p>WERE PLACED IN THE WAY OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p> </p><p>HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND COERCION MARRED </p><p>THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. AN ASSESSMENT OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION SINCE FEBRUARY 2000 MADE BY THE EU ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVATION MISSION, TOGETHER WITH REPORTS FROM EU OBSERVERS </p><p>OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE EARLY JUNE, INDICATE </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BULK OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03482  02 OF 03  261435Z </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF LEADERS SEEMED TO SANCTION THE USE OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CONTRIBUTED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CLIMATE OF FEAR SO EVIDENT DURING THE </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN. CALLS FOR PEACEFUL CAMPAIGNING AND </p><p>EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN PARTY SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS, WERE OFTEN AMBIGUOUS.  OVERALL, THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND </p><p>COMPROMISED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS WERE ALSO ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION, BUT THE DEGREE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>SUCH ACTIVITIES WAS FAR LESS. MOREOVER, MDC LEADERS WERE </p><p>CLEARER IN THEIR CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, AND THE ABILITY TO </p><p>CAMPAIGN IN RELATIVE PEACE, VARIED CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE </p><p>PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER. EU OBSERVERS MONITORED </p><p>SCORES OF POLITICAL RALLIES IN ALL PROVINCES OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>ORGANISED BOTH BY ZANU-PF AND MDC. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE MAJOR CITIES, ALTHOUGH INTIMIDATION WAS FAR FROM </p><p>ABSENT, THE CAMPAIGN WAS ROBUST. IN MANY RURAL AREAS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE LEVELS OF INTIMIDATION BY ZANU-PF WERE SO </p><p>INTENSE AS TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p> </p><p>DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA DID NOT </p><p>PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES CONTESTING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03482  02 OF 03  261435Z </p><p>ELECTION. BOTH THE PUBLIC BROADCASTER, THE ZBC, AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPERS WERE USED AS PUBLICITY </p><p>VEHICLES FOR ZANU-PF. THE ZBC FAILED TO ENSURE INFORMED </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE. PROPAGANDA CROWDED OUT THE REAL ISSUES OF </p><p>THE CAMPAIGN. OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE HAD TO RELY ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL MEDIA ONLY. </p><p> </p><p>VOTING AND THE COUNT </p><p> </p><p>GENERALLY SPEAKING THE VOTING WAS CALM AND WELL ORGANISED. </p><p>THE EU OBSERVER TEAMS, WORKING IN CO-ORDINATION WITH OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF CIVIC </p><p>ORGANISATIONS, VISITED SOME 1,700 POLLING STATIONS OVER THE </p><p>TWO DAYS OF VOTING, MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL. </p><p> </p><p>THEIR OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLLING IS HIGHLY POSITIVE. </p><p>PRESIDING OFFICERS AND THEIR STAFF ON THE WHOLE WERE </p><p>COMPETENT AND EFFICIENT.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, SERIOUS </p><p>PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE VOTERS\' ROLL AND THE NUMBER OF </p><p>INTENDING VOTERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. </p><p>MOREOVER, AS A RESULT OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS PLACED IN THE WAY </p><p>OF DOMESTIC MONITORS, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS WAS SERIOUSLY </p><p>COMPROMISED. </p><p> </p><p>OUR VERDICT ON THE COUNTING PROCESS WILL BE MADE CLEAR AT A </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8690 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03482  03 OF 03  261436Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------670693  261436Z /38 </p><p>O 261439Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6438 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003482 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S RICE, P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.
