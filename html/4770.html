<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 009040 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE MEETS WITH TURKISH </p><p>LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT SEZER </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  In Dec. 13 meetings with President Sezer, </p><p>MFA Deputy U/S </p><p>for the Middle East Tuygan, and representatives of ruling AK </p><p>Party and main </p><p>opposition CHP,  American Jewish Committee (AJC) leaders </p><p>affirmed AJC\'s support </p><p>for Turkey.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Dec. 13 AJC President Tanner, Director of Government </p><p>Affairs Isaacson and </p><p>Strategic Studies Director (retired FSO) Jacobs visited </p><p>high-level GOT and </p><p>party officials to reaffirm AJC\'s continued lobbying support </p><p>for Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with President Sezer </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DCM accompanied Tanner, Isaacson and Jacobs to their </p><p>meeting with Sezer, who, </p><p>noted his appreciation for the AJC\'s work on behalf of </p><p>Turkey.  Tanner reassured </p><p>Sezer of Turkey\'s importance for the U.S. Jewish community, </p><p>as well as AJC\'s </p><p>support of Turkey\'s application to the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Commenting that Turkey\'s relations with the U.S. are </p><p>improving, Sezer </p><p>focused on the particularly close bilateral political and </p><p>military relations and </p><p>looked forward to closer commercial relations.  In this </p><p>regard, he noted the </p><p>mutual U.S., Israeli and Turkish efforts to establish </p><p>qualifying industrial zones (QIZs) </p><p>in Turkey.  Affirming the cooperation among the U.S., Israel </p><p>and Turkey, he </p><p>commented that both Turkey and Israel live in a region where </p><p>terrorism occurs </p><p>and violence escalates daily.  Since the escalation of </p><p>violence is not to </p><p>the advantage of Israelis or Palestinians, Sezer stated </p><p>Turkey is ready to help </p><p>initiate a new round in the MEPP and to host an international </p><p>meeting of both </p><p>sides regarding these issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In response, Tanner appraised a number of Turkey\'s </p><p>strengths:  (1) its </p><p>location -- on the one hand, it can negotiate to join the EU </p><p>and on the other </p><p>hand it is part of the Middle East; (2) it is a large </p><p>democratic country that </p><p>is a bridge between east and west; (3) its geography </p><p>facilitates a unique role. </p><p>Tanner said the people of Israel thirst and hunger for peace. </p><p> He asked that </p><p>both he and Sezer pray in their separate ways so that people </p><p>in Turkey and </p><p>Israel can settle on a two-state solution and people can be </p><p>recognized by </p><p>their neighbors in peace.  In response to Sezer\'s questions </p><p>about regional </p><p>instability, a U.S. operation against Iraq, expansion of </p><p>tensions, and expansion of </p><p>Israeli settlements, Tanner replied he is always concerned </p><p>about war, but that </p><p>the potential operation against Iraq is not an Israeli war. </p><p>The Israelis are </p><p>in great jeopardy and more exposed than anyone else, but as </p><p>an organization, </p><p>the AJC has no position on war.  Even if the Jewish community </p><p>or Israel felt </p><p>the United States should wait until some other event </p><p>occurred, war is </p><p>not an issue the AJC could influence.  Sezer concurred that </p><p>Turkey faces similar </p><p>problems from terrorist activities and efforts for peace will </p><p>take longer to be </p><p>achieved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with Ambassador Ali Tuygan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In his meeting with the delegation, Deputy U/S for </p><p>Bilateral Political </p><p>Affairs with the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Pacific </p><p>Ali Tuygan (has served as </p><p>Turkish ambassador to Riyadh) commented that the Qataris have </p><p>indicated they </p><p>would like to conduct a "dialogue of civilizations." </p><p>Exploring the idea of </p><p>mutual understanding in response to a question from Isaacson </p><p>about how to avoid </p><p>expressions that are offensive in the Arab world, Tuygan </p><p>responded it is necessary </p><p>to insert Turkey in the dialogue.  Tanner said that since </p><p>September 11, he </p><p>has noted that education in the Arab world is geared toward </p><p>hatred of Israel, </p><p>the Jews, U.S. and Christians.  Tuygan concurred, saying </p><p>Turkey faces similar </p><p>problems with its neighbors promoting anti-Turkish </p><p>sentiments, but Turkey is </p><p>making an effort to change this, although necessarily slowly </p><p>and patiently. </p><p>7. (C) Jacobs declared that Saudi Arabia is seen as a source </p><p>of terrorism </p><p>financing, particularly in promoting a hatred of Jews. </p><p>Tuygan noted this is </p><p>known to everyone and that Turkey faced a similar situation </p><p>in the Balkans. </p><p>Responding to Jacobs\' discussion of schools as a breeding </p><p>ground for terrorism, </p><p>Tuygan replied that the desire for change in Turkey\'s </p><p>neighbors is genuine. </p><p>For example, in Iran, women are gradually pulling their </p><p>scarves back from their </p><p>faces and showing small, but incrementally significant </p><p>portions of their </p><p>hairline. In response to Isaacson\'s question about how the </p><p>friends of democracy </p><p>can speed change, Tuygan pointed to economic cooperation and </p><p>the willingness to </p><p>face a certain amount of uneasiness.  Discussing other </p><p>relationships in </p><p>the region, Tuygan declared: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Iran and Iraq have a chance to finish each other off. </p><p>--Turkey\'s relationship with Syria changed after the </p><p>rendition of former </p><p>PKK leader Ocalan; cooperation is on the rise.  Bashar Assad </p><p>was brought in by </p><p>the old guard of advisors. </p><p>--Egyptians are quiet about their relations with Turkey; Amr </p><p>Moussa is </p><p>trying to be moderate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Queried about initiatives for future peace </p><p>conferences, Tuygan </p><p>suggested working through football, soccer or basketball </p><p>sports clubs, </p><p>emphasizing that governments and NGOs must also make efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with AKP Vice Chairman Murat Mercan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AK vice chairman for media and information Murat </p><p>Mercan opined </p><p>that EU membership is being withheld from Turkey perhaps </p><p>on (1) cultural grounds, (2) religious grounds or (3) </p><p>possibly the EU </p><p>leadership\'s failure to prepare the populace and its system </p><p>for Turkish </p><p>accession.  Mercan declared that Turkey is better developed </p><p>and better prepared than </p><p>other aspiring EU candidates in eastern Europe.  He also </p><p>observed that </p><p>he does not have as close relations with the Israeli Embassy </p><p>in Ankara </p><p>as with the German, French and U.S. embassies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Tanner emphasized the uniqueness of both </p><p>Israel and Turkey in being the only democracies in the </p><p>region.  Mercan and </p><p>Tanner both agreed on the need to fight terrorism to protect </p><p>the world for </p><p>their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with CHP Chairman Deniz Baykal </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Baykal described his party\'s current mandate as </p><p>"containing the </p><p>situation and preventing any move to rewrite the constitution </p><p>of </p><p>Turkey.  Asked about Cyprus, clearly a sensitive issue for </p><p>him, Baykal averred </p><p>that the situation is difficult and does not reflect the </p><p>aspirations of the Turkish </p><p>community.  However, Baykal said he supports negotiations for </p><p>a peaceful solution. </p><p>He recommended that a third party should intervene to achieve </p><p>a solution in Cyprus; </p><p>the UNSYG is best positioned to do this.  Baykal </p><p>concluded by speculating that relations between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey could deteriorate if Turkey is not admitted to the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Tanner, who had met with AKP Chairman Erdogan in </p><p>Washington, described him as "practical and straightforward." </p><p> In response, </p><p>Baykal asserted that AKP would need to establish itself in </p><p>Turkish politics to </p><p>determine the proper direction of the society\'s wishes.  CHP </p><p>will monitor </p><p>AKP\'s program to be sure AK stays on track and does not </p><p>try to "initiate unacceptable practices."  CHP will create </p><p>momentum to prevent </p><p>radical changes.  At the end of the meeting, Baykal expressed </p><p>appreciation for </p><p>U.S. assistance to Turkish reconstruction after World War II. </p><p> Tanner said </p><p>that Truman Doctrine assistance to Turkey had its roots in </p><p>Henry Morgenthau\'s </p><p>father\'s tenure as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey in 1913. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
