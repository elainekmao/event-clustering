<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BM, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: JAPANESE VIEWS OF RAZALI\'S MISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: According to Japanese Embassy sources in </p><p>Rangoon, at the upcoming UN meetings in Tokyo, Japan will </p><p>argue that the current sanctions-based western approach to </p><p>Burma has failed and should be revised to allow for a more </p><p>gradual process of transition, more direct aid support and </p><p>more dialogue with regional states regarding the implications </p><p>of change in Burma.  The Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Yuji </p><p>Miyamoto, has taken the lead on formulating this approach and </p><p>will likely be the prime GOJ spokesman at the meetings.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOJ believes that the Razali process will have to </p><p>be reformulated before it can make any further progress in </p><p>Burma.  According to the Japanese Embassy\'s Political </p><p>Counselor, Rokuichiro Michii, the GOJ, led by Ambassador </p><p>Miyamoto, has reached a number of conclusions in recent </p><p>weeks.  First, the GOJ believes that Than Shwe has emerged as </p><p>the single important decision-maker in the GOB; "everything," </p><p>according to Michii, "centered on him."  Secondly, there was </p><p>now little pressure for change in Burma.  While Burma\'s </p><p>economic situation was problematic, the problems were not </p><p>serious enough to force change.  Similarly, Western ties with </p><p>Burma were now minimal and Western sanctions ineffectual, </p><p>given the absolute absence of front line state support for </p><p>sanctions.  India, China, Thailand and all other regional </p><p>states were now all engaged with the GOB, Michii noted; none </p><p>were prepared to put their relations with Burma at risk for </p><p>the sake of political change.  On the contrary, all now </p><p>effectively provided a cushion of support for the GOB in the </p><p>face of western sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The GOJ also believed that no confidence had been </p><p>re-established between the GOB and the NLD, despite two years </p><p>of talks. While the SPDC had made "tactical concessions," </p><p>there were "no incentives" for it to change, Michii said. </p><p>Meanwhile, there were many "risks" to embarking on a course </p><p>of political change while active insurgencies continued in </p><p>the countryside.  As for the NLD, it too feared to </p><p>compromise, acording to Michii.  Aung San Suu Kyi\'s release </p><p>in May had created high expectations, which could backfire on </p><p>the party if the NLD settled for anything less than a full </p><p>participatory democracy.  On the other hand, the NLD also </p><p>knew the risks of trying to force the pace of change.  In </p><p>1990 and 1998, it had been the victim of government </p><p>crackdowns and did not want to go that route again.  Hence, </p><p>it had settled for an ineffectual middle course -- demanding </p><p>change, but doing nothing directly to press the government </p><p>towards change. </p><p> </p><p>The Problems </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As for UN Special Envoy Razali, Micchi said, Japan </p><p>supported him and his efforts.  It also believed that </p><p>Razali\'s "facilitation" had produced some results; e.g., the </p><p>release of political prisoners and some additional political </p><p>space for the NLD.  However, there were problems with the </p><p>current process.  First of all, Razali did not enjoy full </p><p>international support.  By and large, regional states, </p><p>including front line states like India, China and Thailand, </p><p>viewed Razali\'s mission as a western initiative meant to </p><p>serve western interests in human rights even at the expense </p><p>of issues of high interest to regional states like narcotics </p><p>control, refugees, and regional development.  Those states </p><p>might give lip service to Razali\'s efforts, but none were </p><p>prepared to sacrifice their relations with Burma for the sake </p><p>of his program.  Secondly, Razali had set his sights too </p><p>high, according to Michii.  Given adequate incentives, the </p><p>GOB might sign on for some process leading to a "guided </p><p>democracy;" however, it would not accept the full </p><p>participatory democracy that the West, following the NLD, was </p><p>now demanding.  Finally, the GOJ felt that the international </p><p>community had used only "sticks and no carrots" in dealing </p><p>with the SPDC.  It had not toned down its rhetoric and had </p><p>not delivered on promises of support even for humanitarian </p><p>issues. </p><p>Japanese Proposals </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) To deal with these problems, the GOJ plans to </p><p>recommend in Tokyo that the international community take </p><p>steps to make Razali\'s mission relevant to, or at least </p><p>compatible with, regional interests.  In its view, if we </p><p>continue as we are today, with western states headed in one </p><p>direction and regional states in another, then the chances </p><p>for any succesful internationally led effort at change will </p><p>be small.  Secondly, the Japanese will argue that the West </p><p>should be realistic regarding its expectations for change. </p><p>The NLD might be constrained regarding the types of change it </p><p>could advocate, but the West need not remain locked in that </p><p>same box.  If a slower, but ultimately more promising process </p><p>could be worked out, then that is the direction in which we </p><p>should move with or without an explicit endorsement from the </p><p>NLD.  Finally, if the West truly wanted the Razali process to </p><p>work, it had to be more generous, Michii said.  Right now, </p><p>the west was advocating radical change without providing any </p><p>restructuring support.  Not unreasonably, the GOB and most </p><p>regional governments questioned the wisdom of that approach </p><p>in a country with such deeply-rooted problems. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The analysis above is not new, but it is accurate. </p><p>There is little pressure for change or inclination towards </p><p>compromise in Burma now.  The economy is faltering, but not </p><p>so badly as to completely undermine the government\'s hold on </p><p>power.  Western sanctions hurt, but not enough to threaten </p><p>the government.  Meanwhile, those same sanctions alienate </p><p>regional states, who feel that the West has placed its </p><p>interest in human rights before their interest in regional </p><p>stability and regional development.  As a result, the West </p><p>has ended up trying to run a blockade without front-line </p><p>state support.  Not surprisingly, that approach has failed. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Whether anything else is possible is the real </p><p>question.  The prescription the Japanese plan to offer fits </p><p>the diagnosis, but they will need the bedside manner of </p><p>saints to make that prescription go down with Western </p><p>governments.  More dialogue with regional states regarding </p><p>the regional implications of change in Burma, more realistic </p><p>goals for the process of transition and more direct aid </p><p>support for change could all help the transition process. </p><p>When all is said and done, however, the GOJ will essentially </p><p>be asking the West to distinguish its political goals from </p><p>those of the Burmese domestic political opposition led by </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.  The Japanese may be right in </p><p>arguing that the NLD is trapped by the current configuration </p><p>of political forces into taking a maximalist position. </p><p>Unfortunately, they may find that the West as a whole is in </p><p>exactly the same position. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In any case,  USG representatives should be prepared </p><p>to react to the Japanese analysis and presentation in Tokyo. </p><p>From what we understand, this position has been well vetted </p><p>within the GOJ and could determine Japanese policy in Burma </p><p>for some time to come, regardless of any decisions taken at </p><p>the coming meeting.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
