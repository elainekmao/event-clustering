<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S-ES/O PLEASE ALERT AF/FO (A/S KANSTEINER) AND E STAFF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, CASC, AINR, ASEC, PINS, ELAB, PREF, NI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: NIGERIAN CRUDE PRODUCTION DROPS ABOUT 33% </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) Abuja 554 </p><p>-         (B) Abuja 555 </p><p>-         (C) Lagos 624 </p><p>-         (D) FBIS RESTON 231918ZMAR03(AFP) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(c) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Ongoing ethnic strife may cut Nigeria\'s </p><p>crude production by 33% and its exports by 43% -- larger cuts </p><p>than most media are reporting.  The evacuation of Escravos, </p><p>hub for 440,000 of ChevronTexaco\'s 510,000 bpd, is expected to </p><p>conclude March 24.  ChevronTexaco seeks U.S. imagery support. </p><p>These cuts amount to about one percent of world daily crude </p><p>production, but the impact on the U.S. is likely to be </p><p>disproportionate.  Meanwhile, Nigeria\'s national labor </p><p>federation is threatening a general strike for April 1. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Further to Refs A-C, ChevronTexaco (CT) Managing </p><p>Director Jay Pryor late afternoon of March 23 told the </p><p>Ambassador that CT was suspending all crude production </p><p>dependent on the Escravos tank farm, about 440,000 of CT\'s </p><p>average 510,000 bpd.  Pryor said Shell was losing 240,000 to </p><p>280,000 bpd because of strife precipitated by Ijaw militias, </p><p>and that TotalFinaElf had lost between 30,000 and 40,000 bpd. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Assuming Pryor\'s figures are correct, and they have </p><p>also been verified by the British High Commission, Nigeria\'s </p><p>daily production has fallen from around 2.2 mbpd to about 1.46 </p><p>mbpd, a drop of approximately 33%, in under a week.  If </p><p>Nigeria continues to use 450,000 bpd for internal consumption </p><p>(domestic refining and swaps for refined products), then </p><p>exports will have dropped 43%.  COMMENT:  We have no reason to </p><p>doubt Pryor\'s figures, but most media, including Ref D, give a </p><p>lower figure (around 195,000 bpd) for Shell losses.  However, </p><p>major producers (and Shell is Nigeria\'s largest) often have </p><p>excess capacity.  Shell\'s losses in the affected areas could </p><p>well be on the order of 260,000 bpd, but it might be able to </p><p>"make up" some of that from other fields.  CT\'s production, on </p><p>the other hand, is heavily concentrated around Escravos and </p><p>its production is now 70,000 bpd from two other facilities. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>EVACUATION </p><p>------------ </p><p>4.  (U) According to Pryor, the two Antonov transport aircraft </p><p>CT had planned to use to evacuate personnel and IDPs from </p><p>Escravos were not able to make the trip from South Africa. </p><p>However, CT was able to deploy a fleet of smaller aircraft. </p><p>It expects to complete the evacuation by mid-day on Monday, </p><p>March 24.  From 35-50 persons will remain at the tank farm to </p><p>provide maintenance and keep utilities operating, among other </p><p>tasks.  Another 8-9 persons will stay on CT\'s platform at the </p><p>mouth of the river. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Pryor reported that approximately 280 GON security </p><p>personnel, a mixture of Army, Navy and Police (MOPOL) were in </p><p>and around Escravos.  There have been no problems in the 36 </p><p>hours prior to his conversation with the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>IMAGERY </p><p>------------ </p><p>6.  (C) Pryor reported that the GON was already pressing CT to </p><p>bring Escravos back into operation but that CT thought the </p><p>Escravos area remained too tense and unstable for operations </p><p>to resume.  Even once the GON provided CT with an "all-clear," </p><p>the company would be reluctant to resume operations without </p><p>independent confirmation (via imagery) that calm had returned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) We understand that the USG has sometimes provided U.S. </p><p>firms imagery of oil-producing areas that had suffered from </p><p>instability or insurgency.  We understand, for example, that </p><p>this was done in Angola.  We believe CT must understand that </p><p>USG imagery assets are fully deployed for other purposes at </p><p>this time.  Nonetheless, we pass along CT\'s request, as we </p><p>know that each day with Escravos off-line is a day with </p><p>440,000 barrels of crude lost to U.S. and world markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) 735,000 bpd would amount to just under one percent </p><p>of daily worldwide crude oil production (79 mbpd).  There is </p><p>no guarantee that production losses will not climb higher </p><p>before stability returns to the Niger Delta.  As we reported </p><p>previously (Ref B), inter-ethnic tensions in the Niger Delta </p><p>are being aggravated by electoral politics.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is publicly threatening a </p><p>nationwide general strike for April 1, if the GON fails to </p><p>implement a 12.5% increase in civil service salaries and the </p><p>minimum wage.  While the last NLC-sponsored general strike (an </p><p>effort to roll back an increase in motor fuel prices) fizzled, </p><p>organized labor in Nigeria remains a potent force.  Oil </p><p>companies may be reluctant to restart production in the days </p><p>ahead if they fear the petroleum sector unions (NUPENG and </p><p>PENGASSAN) might join the general strike.  They certainly will </p><p>not resume without iron-clad assurances of security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Lost Nigerian oil production may have a larger </p><p>impact on the U.S. than mere percentages would suggest.  The </p><p>U.S. has long been the largest consumer of Nigerian crude; in </p><p>2001 our average daily imports from Nigeria were about 800,000 </p><p>bpd (according to a "Newsweek" article that cited the IEA). </p><p>In addition, Nigeria sells crude oil to Caribbean and Canadian </p><p>refineries that blend its light, sweet crude with heavier </p><p>varieties (primarily from Canada and Venezuela) to refine </p><p>motor fuels that are then sold in the U.S.  Precise figures </p><p>are impossible to derive, but estimates from 2000 suggested </p><p>the U.S. was the end-consumer of about 80% (between 1.2 and </p><p>1.3 mbpd) of Nigeria\'s crude production that year.  Canada\'s </p><p>Deputy High Commissioner recently told us that this business </p><p>continued to be important for refineries on his country\'s </p><p>Atlantic coast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) If production losses in the 700,000-plus bpd range </p><p>continue for very long, Nigeria will have to draw down its </p><p>foreign exchange reserves (already lower than a year ago) </p><p>further to support the Naira.  For political reasons, the GON </p><p>cannot permit a significant devaluation of the currency now, </p><p>just weeks before national elections.  One of many tools that </p><p>Nigeria traditionally has used to maintain its influence in </p><p>West Africa has been to provide other countries with some </p><p>crude oil on concessional terms.  We do not know the current </p><p>daily volume of these deals.  However, the GON may have to </p><p>reduce or halt deliveries of such shipments until production </p><p>returns to normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Abidjan minimize considered. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
