<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI KING ASKS PARTY LEADERS FOR CONSENSUS </p><p>CANDIDATE TO HEAD NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0991 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0961 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Breaking with past practice, Nepal\'s King Gyanendra </p><p>convoked on May 30 leaders of the seven parties that had held </p><p>seats in the last Parliament to offer them an opportunity to </p><p>constitute a new, more broadly-based government (Ref A).  The </p><p>King assured the leaders that a new Prime Minister would be </p><p>vested with full executive authority.  According to a </p><p>well-placed Palace source, the meeting failed to produce a </p><p>consensus candidate to head a new government.  The King has </p><p>given the parties 72 hours in which to provide him the name </p><p>of a consensus candidate (or, failing that, names of several </p><p>candidates from which he could choose) that they would accept </p><p>as the new Prime Minister.  He ruled out the possibility of </p><p>restoring the Parliament that was dissolved one year ago. </p><p>The King\'s actions, as reported, appear to reflect a </p><p>good-faith effort to form the all-party government with full </p><p>executive powers that the Parliamentary parties have been </p><p>demanding.  It remains to be seen whether the contentious </p><p>parties can overcome their typical preoccuptation with </p><p>personal and partisan self-interest to agree on a candidate. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CONSENSUS ELUDES PARTY HEADS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Early on the morning of May 31, Prabhakar Rana, King </p><p>Gyanendra\'s confidant, called the Charge to offer a read-out </p><p>"from the horse\'s mouth" on the King\'s May 30 meeting with </p><p>party leaders (Ref A).  The meeting, which lasted </p><p>two-and-a-half hours, was attended by leaders of the seven </p><p>Parliamentary parties, including leaders of two factions that </p><p>have splintered from their main party leadership since the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament last May.  The King reportedly </p><p>opened the meeting, called to help form a new all-party </p><p>government, by requesting that the leaders focus on the </p><p>"process" of chooosing a leader rather than on the particular </p><p>"personality" that might be chosen.  He also emphasized that </p><p>he would confer on the new government full executive powers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Rana\'s account, the party leaders, the </p><p>King\'s plea not withstanding, immediately zeroed in on </p><p>"personalities," with the leaders of the two largest parties </p><p>objecting strenuously to the presence of the leaders of the </p><p>splinter factions of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party and the </p><p>Nepali Congress (Democratic).  Nepali Congress President G.P. </p><p>Koirala and Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninst </p><p>(UML) General Secretary Madhav Nepal claimed that since their </p><p>parties, along with the People\'s Front Nepal and the Peasants </p><p>and Workers Party, represent three-fourths of the seats in </p><p>Parliament, formation of the new government should be left to </p><p>them.  The King responded that since the parties had been </p><p>pressing for an all-party government, all of the parties </p><p>represented in the last Parliament should be involved. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Nepali Congress leader Koirala proposed that the King </p><p>reinstate Parliament, with the head of the UML (which would </p><p>now hold the majority in Parliament) as the new Prime </p><p>Minister.  The proposal reportedly brought a clamor of </p><p>counter-demands for consideration of their own candidacy from </p><p>other leaders present.  Nepali Congress (Democratic) leader </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba said that as PM during the last </p><p>Parliament, he should be reappointed Prime Minister if </p><p>Parliament were to be reinstated.  National Democratic Party </p><p>President Pashupati SJB Rana argued that since his party </p><p>alone has observed the Constitution and not agitated against </p><p>the King, he should be appointed Prime Minister.  Nepal </p><p>Sadbhavana leader and current Deputy Prime Minister Badri </p><p>Prasad Mandal contended that all of the other Parliamentary </p><p>parties had violated the Constitution by calling for the </p><p>postponement of elections.  He then put forward his own name </p><p>as the most suitable candidate.  (Note:  Mandal is on </p><p>somewhat shaky ground here.  The Nepal Sadbhavana did not </p><p>oppose the postponement of elections in October.  Since then, </p><p>however, the party has splintered, and Mandal is apparently </p><p>trying to represent his splinter as not agreeing to the </p><p>postponement.   End note.) </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>72-HOUR DEADLINE FOR CONSENSUS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) According to Rana, the King categorically ruled out </p><p>any possibility of reconvening Parliament as </p><p>"unconstituional."  (Note:  The Supreme Court has ruled that </p><p>the dissolution was constitutional.  End note.)  He then gave </p><p>the parties a 72-hour deadline in which to present him with </p><p>the name of a consensus candidate for Prime Minister.  Should </p><p>the seven parties be unable to settle on a single name, he </p><p>gave them the alternative of proposing a slate of several </p><p>names from which he might choose.  He cautioned them, </p><p>however, not to ask him to take any "unconstitutional" steps </p><p>(which we interpret as a warning that he will not accept </p><p>requests to reconvene Parliament). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The King\'s actions, as reported, appear to reflect a </p><p>good-faith effort to form the all-party government with full </p><p>executive authority that the parties have been demanding and </p><p>that we (and other embassies) have been pressing.  His move </p><p>has clearly shifted the burden for positive movement toward </p><p>more representative government squarely onto the parties. </p><p>Given the parties\' abysmal track record for collaboration and </p><p>cooperation--and the debilitating animosity between several </p><p>of the more prominent personalities--it remains to be seen </p><p>whether they can achieve the consensus necessary within the </p><p>time given.  We will continue to engage with party members to </p><p>urge them to take advantage of the King\'s initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
