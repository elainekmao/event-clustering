End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. Coast Guard Training Graduation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  A five-person U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) team </p><p>instructed 21 Yemeni officers from the Yemen Coast Guard, </p><p>Navy, and Special Forces in a nine-day "Waterside Port </p><p>Security Course (CG-28)."  The Ambassador attended the July 8 </p><p>graduation ceremony and made a brief statement on the </p><p>importance of continued U.S.-Yemen maritime cooperation. </p><p>USCG trainers were impressed by the students\' attitude and </p><p>ROYG cooperation.  The ceremony was also attended by Deputy </p><p>Governor Abdul-Karim Shaif who noted that maritime </p><p>cooperation to thwart the terrorist threat was still in its </p><p>infancy and "close cooperation with the U.S. must continue". </p><p>He thanked the U.S. for the training and vowed to find ways </p><p>to increase the level of cooperation.  (Note:  See septel. </p><p>The graduation was covered by numerous media outlets, </p><p>including the Yemen Observer, Al-Ayyam, Saba News Agency, and </p><p>Al-Tariq.  The Ambassador and the Lieutenant-in-Charge of </p><p>U.S. Coast Guard training were interviewed by Al-Ayyam.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Following the graduation, the Ambassador hosted a </p><p>lunch for the Deputy Governor and officials from the Yemen </p><p>Coast Guard, Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and </p><p>Hodeidah Shipping Company.  Conversation focused on the </p><p>operating parameters of the Yemen Coast Guard, including the </p><p>legality of customary fees, stateless vessels, and "piracy" </p><p>vs. "larceny". </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Aden International Airport </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

DG Al-Khadhar provided the Ambassador with a history of </p><p>the Aden Airport from the 1940s to present day, and discussed </p><p>ongoing renovations.  He highlighted the extensive </p><p>cooperation between the airport and the U.S. and produced an </p><p>overflowing dossier of flight clearances and diplomatic notes </p><p>from the U.S., including correspondence during the USS Cole </p><p>investigation.  Khadhar and Funasi discussed the airport\'s </p><p>security at length, including talking through hypothetical </p><p>scenarios raised by the Ambassador, and escorted the </p><p>Ambassador on a private tour of the airport facilities -- </p><p>stopping for a demonstration of the Terrorist Interdiction </p><p>Program (TIP) PISCES system.

Prados, who has been working in Yemen for over three </p><p>years, is scheduled to depart later this month.  Sharing some </p><p>of his observations, Prados noted that the selection of a new </p><p>Political Security Chief, and an ambitious and open-minded </p><p>Governor, are positive developments for the entire </p><p>governorate.  He called the December 2003 opening of a new </p><p>shopping complex -- constructed by businessman and Member of </p><p>Parliament Hayeel Saeed -- and the selection of Aden as a </p><p>World Bank Port City as concrete examples of positive change. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Prados also identified areas for continued study </p><p>prior to the launch of E-Learning, the MEPI funded Internet </p><p>in Schools project for 20 schools Yemen-wide (5 in Aden).  He </p><p>said that empowering teachers is key to the long-term success </p><p>of the project, and voiced concern about schools\' ability to </p><p>cover recurring costs like electricity.  PAO clarified that </p><p>over half the E-Learning budget is designated for training </p><p>and curriculum development, and teacher training will be an </p><p>integral part of the program\'s implementation.  PAO also </p><p>discussed the importance of gaining the support of the </p><p>business community to ensure adequate funding for recurring </p><p>costs, and, if possible, to expand E-Learning beyond the 20 </p><p>pilot schools. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Bio Note </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Bio note - Aden Airport Deputy Director General </p><p>Mohamed al-Funasi:  Al-Funasi spent two years with the </p><p>British Royal Marines and worked on security at airports in </p><p>the Netherlands and Germany.
