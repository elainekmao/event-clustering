AT A MAY 10 MEETING AT UN HQ IN ZAGREB, UNSYG SPECIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE YASUSHI AKASHI TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH </p><p>THAT "RSK PRESIDENT" MILAN MARTIC APPEARED TO HAVE A </p><p>"FIRMER GRIP ON REALITY" DURING THEIR DISCUSSIONS THE </p><p>PREVLOUS DAY IN BELGRADE AND THAT THE "HIGH POINT OF </p><p>TENSIONS" SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED.  HE DEFENDED HIS FAILURE </p><p>TO INFORM ZAGREB DIPLOMATS OF MARTIC\'S THREAT TO BOMB THE </p><p>CITY BY SAYING HE BELIEVED IT WAS A BLUFF, ONLY POSTURING. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  FOLLOWING HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF SARINIC EARLIER IN THE DAY, AKASHI SAID HE FELT THE </p><p>CROATS "WERE TRYING HARD TO COOPERATE" WITH THE UN IN </p><p>"SECTOR WEST."  THE UN\'S FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>ALMOST COMPLETELY RESTORED AND SARINIC HAD AGREED TO UN </p><p>MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  NEVERTHELESS, AKASHI WAS </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE SLOW PACE FOR THE RELEASE OF SERBIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01822  01 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>DETAINEES.  THE SERBS WERE STILL REQUIRING A "SOLUTION" TO </p><p>SECTOR WEST BEFORE THEY WOULD COME TO THE NEGOTIATING </p><p>TABLE IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TURNING TO BOSNIA, AKASHI CLAIMED THAT SARAJEVO </p><p>COMMANDER GENERAL RUPERT SMITH HAD WAFFLED ON THE DECISION </p><p>TO CALL AIR STRIKES, INITIALLY ARGUING AGAINST THEM, LATER </p><p>CHANGING HIS MIND, AND FINALLY COMING AROUND TO HIS </p><p>ORIGINAL POSITION.  THE AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT THE UN\'S </p><p>PREFERENCE FOR TALKS AND ACCOMMODATION TO BRING THE SERRS </p><p>AROUND HAD BEEN TRIED FOR THREE YEARS AND PROVEN A </p><p>FAILURE.  THE TIME HAD COME TO SEND TO THE SERBS THE ONLY </p><p>KIND OF SIGNAL THEY UNDERSTAND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MARTIC LESS "DERANGED"; FIRMER GRIP ON REALITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  AKASHI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS MEETING IN </p><p>BELGRADE MAY 9 WITH THE "RSK" LEADERSHIP (MARTIC, MIKELIC, </p><p>AND BABIC) WAS BETTER THAN THEIR PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER ON MAY </p><p>5 IN KNIN.  HE FELT THAT THE HIGHEST POINT OF TENSION HAD </p><p>PASSED.  ON MAY 5, AKASHI FOUND MARTIC "UPTIGHT, NERVOUS, </p><p>BITTER, DAZED BY DEFEAT AND SOMEWHAT DERANGED, SHOWING </p><p>SIGNS OF HAVING LOST HIS GRIP ON REALITY."  ON MAY 9, HE </p><p>SEEMED TO HAVE RECOVERED SOME OF HIS COMPOSURE, AND HE </p><p>REFRAINED FROM REPEATING MOST OF THE THREATS HE HAD MADE </p><p>AT THE EARLIER MEETING (INCLUDING FURTHER ROCKETING OF </p><p>ZAGREB).  NEVERTHELESS, HE STILL HAD A LONG LIST OF </p><p>GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01822  01 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>6.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED </p><p>THAT MARTIC\'S THREAT, IN THE MAY 5 MEETING, TO "FLATTEN </p><p>ZAGREB" HAD NOT BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COMMUNITY IN ZAGREB.  AKASHI SAID THAT, DURING THE </p><p>MEETING, MARTIC HAD INITIALLY THREATENED TO BOMB ZAGREB </p><p>WITHIN 24 HOURS, THEN 48, AND FINALLY FOUR DAYS.  TOWARDS </p><p>THE END OF THE TALKS, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING THE CROATS </p><p>HAD A WEEK TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMANDS.  IN THE END, AKASHI </p><p>CLAIMED, HE FELT THAT IT WAS MOSTLY BLUFF AND POSTURING </p><p>AND THAT IF MARTIC SAW A SINCERE COMMITMENT AND REASONABLE </p><p>SPEED IN RELEASING THE DETAINEES HE WOULD NOT FOLLOW </p><p>THROUGH ON HIS THREAT.  AKASHI ALSO FELT THAT BY </p><p>COMMUNICATING THE THREAT IT WOULD LEAD THE SERBS TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, WHICH WOULD </p><p>BE PLAYING INTO THEIR HANDS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE AMBASSADOR INSISTED THAT, GIVEN AKASHI\'S </p><p>DESCRIPTION OF MARTIC\'S STATE OF MIND, SUCH THREATS SHOULD </p><p>BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LITTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN RISKED RY </p><p>INFORMING THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY OF HIS CONVERSATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ3390 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3390 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01822  02 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  DODE-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      PM-00    P-01     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------C49B20  111610Z /38 </p><p>O 111710Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5738 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 ZAGREB 001822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01822  02 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>FRANKFURT PASS TO A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 05/11/00 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, UN, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  AKASHI SAYS TENSION LOWER IN "RSK"; DEFENDS </p><p>          DECISION ON AIR STRIKES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CROATS "TRYING HARD TO COOPERATE" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  AKASHI SAID THAT HE HAD MET WITH TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF SARINIC AND ACTING HEAD OF CROATIA\'S ARMED FORCES </p><p>GENERAL CERVENKO EARLIER IN THE DAY.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>CROATS WERE "TRYING HARD TO COOPERATE WITH US."  THE UN\'S </p><p>FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN "SECTOR WEST" HAD BEEN ALMOST </p><p>COMPLETELY RESTORED.  NEVERTHELESS, AKASHI WAS CONCERNED </p><p>BY THE SLOWNESS OF PROCESSING THE SERB DETAINEES AND </p><p>PERMITTING THEM TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIA OR RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>HOMES IN CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED, RECOUNTING HOW </p><p>HE HAD CALLED SARINIC FROM STARA GRADISKA TO OBJECT TO THE </p><p>INEXCUSABLE DETENTION OF OLD MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM </p><p>OKUCANI AND THERERY OBTAINED THEIR RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  AKASHI SAID THAT MARTIC SEEMED TO HAVE CUT BACK ON HIS </p><p>EXPECTATIONS ALTHOUGH HE WAS STILL INSISTING ON A </p><p>"RESOLUTION" IN "SECTOR WEST."  IN THE MAY 9 MEETING THE </p><p>SERBS HAD FOCUSSED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING HELD, </p><p>THEIR TREATMENT, AND THE PROCEDURES FOR SCREENING.  (NOTE: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01822  02 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>ICFY AMBASSADOR ALFREDO MATACOTTA TOLD US THAT AT THE </p><p>MEETING ON MAY 9 EVEN MILOSEVIC WAS STILL INSISTING ON A </p><p>RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO BEFORE THE CONFLICT IN SECTOR </p><p>WEST.)  SARINIC HAD TOLD AKASHI THAT ONE OF THE DETAINEES </p><p>WAS SUSPECTED OF KILLING 18 CROATS AND MAY BE TRIED FOR </p><p>WAR CRIMES.  SINCE THE MAY 3 CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES </p><p>AGREEMENT CALLED FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL PRISONERS WITHOUT </p><p>ANY EXCEPTIONS, AKASHI WAS CONCERNED THAT THE SERRS WOULD </p><p>REACT VERY NEGATIVELY IF THE CROATS FAIL TO COMPLY. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>CROATS AGREE TO MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SECTOR WEST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN THE SARINIC-AKASHI MEETING IT WAS AGREED THAT THE </p><p>UN COULD MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SECTOR. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE UN WOULD: </p><p> </p><p>- SUPPORT AND FACILITATE THE RETURN OF PEOPLE TO THEIR </p><p>HOMES OR HELP TRANSPORT THEM TO BOSNIA IF SO DESIRED, </p><p> </p><p>- MONITOR THE RETURN OF DISPLACED PEOPLE TO THE SECTOR, </p><p> </p><p>- ASSIST WITH DEMINING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AGREEMENT, </p><p> </p><p>- ASSURE PASSAGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN FRIENDS AND </p><p>RELATIVES, </p><p> </p><p>- MONITOR PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS, </p><p> </p><p>- PROTECT MINORITIES, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01822  02 OF 05  111610Z </p><p> </p><p>- MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>THESE NEAR- TERM TASKS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION </p><p>WITH UNHCR, ECMM, AND ICRC.

AFTER "SECTOR WEST," AKASHI SAID HIS NEXT PRIORITY </p><p>WAS TO EASE TENSIONS IN THE OTHER SECTORS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>SECTOR EAST.  THE CROATS HAVE PROPOSED A MEETING OF THE </p><p>MILITARY COMMANDERS BUT THE SERBS HAVE BEEN DRAGGING THEIR </p><p>FEET, INSISTING ON A SOLUTION IN "SECTOR WEST" FIRST. </p><p>MILOSEVIC HAD ARGUED THAT THERE COULD BE NO MILITARY </p><p>SOLUTION WITHOUT A POLITICAL SOLUTION COMING OUT OF FACE </p><p>TO FACE TALKS IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ3391 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3391 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01822  03 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  DODE-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      PM-00    P-01     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------C49B34  111610Z /38 </p><p>O 111710Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5739 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 ZAGREB 001822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01822  03 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>FRANKFURT PASS TO A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 05/11/00 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, UN, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  AKASHI SAYS TENSION LOWER IN "RSK"; DEFENDS </p><p>          DECISION ON AIR STRIKES </p><p> </p><p>12.  AKASHI SAID THAT SARINIC WAS WILLING TO HOLD BOTH </p><p>MILITARY AND POLITICAL TALKS AND AGREED TO HOLD AT LEAST </p><p>THE INITIAL TALKS IN GENEVA (WITH SUBSEQUENT TALKS IN </p><p>CROATIA).  MEANWHILE, THE UN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>SERBS NOT TO TACKLE THE ISSUES SEQUENTIALLY (I.E., </p><p>INSISTING ON RESOLVING "SECTOR WEST" FIRST) BUT RATHER </p><p>OPEN UP DISCUSSION TO ALL ISSUES SIMULTANEOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WHEN ASKED IF THE SERBS UNDERSTOOD THAT RESOLVING </p><p>"SECTOR WEST" DID NOT MEAN A RETURN OF "RSK" AUTHORITY IN </p><p>THE SECTOR, AKASHI SAID THAT HE WAS NOT SURE.  MIKELIC, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE MOUTHED MARTIC\'S DEMANDS, SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT THE BASIS FOR NEGOTIATIONS WAS THE MAY 3 AGREEMENT </p><p>(I.E., A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, SURRENDER OF WEAPONS, </p><p>AND THE CHOICE OF REMAINING IN CROATIA OR LEAVING FOR </p><p>BOSNIA) AND NOT THE MAY 2 AGREEMENT WHICH CALLED FOR A </p><p>RETURN TO THE ST </p><p>ATUS QUO ANTE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE USG STRONGLY SUPPORTED </p><p>THE RETURN OF UN AUTHORITY IN THE SECTOR, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>THE AREA OF MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS.  AKASHI REPLIED THAT </p><p>THE UN WOULD SOON BE NEEDING GUIDANCE FROM THE SECURITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01822  03 OF 05  111610Z </p><p>COUNCIL IN DEFINING ITS MANDATE IN THE SECTOR AND IT WOULD </p><p>BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE USG WERE TO TAKE SUCH A POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>AKASHI CLAIMS SMITH WAFFLED, ARGUED AGAINST ON AIR STRIKES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.

AKASHI CLAIMED THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY, </p><p>GENERAL RUPERT SMITH INITIALLY CAME DOWN AGAINST AIR </p><p>STRIKES.  A FEW HOURS LATER, SMITH APPARENTLY CHANGED HIS </p><p>MIND AND CALLED FOR AIR STRIKES, WHICH WERE DENIED BASED </p><p>ON SMITH\'S PREVIOUS ARGUMENTS.  A FEW HOURS LATER, AKASHI </p><p>SAID, SMITH CAME AROUND TO HIS ORIGINAL POSITION.  AKASHI </p><p>QUOTED FROM THE GENERAL\'S INITIAL ANALYSIS, WHICH WE </p><p>PROVIDE BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>17.

THE AIR STRIKES MIGHT NOT STOP THE SERB ATTACKS. </p><p>- </p><p>B.

IT CAN BE ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH A RESPONSE WILL HAVE </p><p>AN IMPACT ON THE CROATIAN SITUATION AND THE ONGOING </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KRAJINA SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  UNPROFOR IS NOT IN TOUCH WITH MLADIC OR OTHER BOSNIAN </p><p>SERB LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>E.

THEIR SITUATION WAS GROWING </p><p>WORSE AS THAT OF THE ROSNIAN GOVERNMENT GREW STRONGER, </p><p>WHICH EXPLAINED WHY THEY WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO FOR A </p><p>DECISION NOW.

AKASHI ARGUED THAT UNDER THOSE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES UN PEACEKEEPERS WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF </p><p>HARM\'S WAY, ESPECIALLY POTENTIAL HOSTAGES LIKE THE UN </p><p>MILITARY OBSERVERS.  AKASHI SAID THE UN HAD NOT DONE THAT </p><p>YET AND NEEDED ADVANCE NOTICE.  HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AIR </p><p>STRIKES MIGHT SOLIDIFY THE POSITION OF THE EXTREMISTS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR COUNTERED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE </p><p>EFFECT, NOTING THAT MARTIC APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED AFTER </p><p> THE CROATIAN ACTION IN SECTOR </p><p>WEST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>"TRIED UN WAY FOR THREE YEARS, NOW ITS TIME TO TRY OURS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE UN HAD TRIED AKASHI\'S </p><p>APPROACH OF NEGOTIATION AND ACCOMMODATION FROM THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT AND THE RESULT HAD REEN THAT THE </p><p>BOSNIAN SERBS HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO GET AWAY WITH </p><p>OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT.  MEANWHILE, THE ONLY SUCCESSES WE HAD </p><p>SEEN TO DATE HAD BEEN AFTER A CREDIBLE THREAT OF USE OF </p><p>FORCE SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXCLUSION ZONE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MARKET PLACE MASSACRE IN SARAJEVO.  THE UN </p><p>AND NATO HAVE ALREADY AGREED ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01822  04 OF 05  111611Z </p><p>SITUATIONS, HE ARGUED, "YOU\'VE TRIED YOUR WAY FOR THREE </p><p>YEARS, NOW IT\'S TIME TO TRY OURS." </p><p> </p><p>23.  AKASHI CAUTIONED THAT THE UN PEACEKEEPERS WERE </p><p>VULNERABLE.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THEY WERE BEING </p><p>TARGETED ANYHOW.  THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO HUNKER DOWN </p><p>UNTIL THE SERBS WERE FORCED TO BACK OFF.  IF ENOUGH PAIN </p><p>WAS INFLICTED THE SERBS WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HONOR </p><p>THE SAFE HAVENS AND REOPEN THE AIRPORT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, AKASHI ARGUED, THE UN </p><p>WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE ENCLAVES, KEEP THE AIRPORT </p><p>OPEN AND PROVIDE SAFE PASSAGE FOR CONVOYS.  HOWEVER, IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTIONING HE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT TWO MONTHS HAD GONE BY WITH NO CONVOYS TO THE </p><p>ENCLAVES AND THE AIRPORT HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR A MONTH WITH </p><p>LITTLE PROSPECT FOR ANY CHANGE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE UN WAS SUFFERING </p><p>TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO ITS IMAGE BY ALLOWING ITSELF TO BE </p><p>HELD UP BY A BUNCH OF THUGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ3394 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3394 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01822  05 OF 05  111611Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  DODE-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      PM-00    P-01     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------C49B55  111611Z /38 </p><p>O 111710Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5741 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 ZAGREB 001822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01822  05 OF 05  111611Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>FRANKFURT PASS TO A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 05/11/00 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, UN, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  AKASHI SAYS TENSION LOWER IN "RSK"; DEFENDS </p><p>          DECISION ON AIR STRIKES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25.  AKASHI NOTED THAT, SINCE THE 1956 SUEZ CRISIS, THE </p><p>UN\'S PEACEKEEPING POLICY HAD BEEN THE IMPARTIAL </p><p>POSITIONING OF TROOPS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IN A CONFLICT, </p><p>USING FORCE ONLY IN SELF-DEFENSE.  SO FAR, THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>NO CLEAR DECISION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR THE TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTING NATIONS THAT A MORE ROBUST, "MUSCULAR USE OF </p><p>FORCE" WAS CALLED FOR.  "IT MAY COME TO THAT," HE SAID, </p><p>"BUT FOR NOW THE SECURITY COUNCIL APPEARS TO HAVE OPTED </p><p>FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF PEACEKEEPING." </p><p> </p><p>26.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF </p><p>PEACEKEEPING IS APPLICABLE WHEN THERE ARE TWO SIDES THAT </p><p>WANT PEACE, WHICH WAS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE IN THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA WHERE THE SERBS HAD SHOWN THAT THEY ONLY </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THE USE OF FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>27.  AKASHI ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONSIDER THE UN\'S </p><p>CAPACITY IN THE REGION, ARGUING THAT ITS FORCES WERE </p><p>NEITHER EQUIPPED, NOR TRAINED, NOR CONFIGURED TO FIGHT A </p><p>WAR AGAINST A NON-COOPERATING PARTY.  UN OBSERVATION POSTS </p><p>WERE LOCATED BETWEEN THE FRONT LINES ONLY BECAUSE THE </p><p>SIDES RESPECT THE UN\'S IMPARTIALITY.
