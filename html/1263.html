(C) THREE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR </p><p>LEGAL COUNSEL AND AN MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON AUGUST 28 THAT PHYSICAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF FARMERS HAD MOSTLY STOPPED.  NOW, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS ENCOURAGING SQUATTERS TO BUILD HOUSES ON </p><p>OCCUPIED LAND.  THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE SITUATION </p><p>ON MANY FARMS IN THE MASVINGO AREA WAS DETERIORATING, AND </p><p>THAT WIDESPREAD POACHING BY WAR VETERANS WAS OCCURRING IN </p><p>GAME RESERVES.  THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION PLANNED TO </p><p>REFILE ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE OF THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT, REVERSING ITS EARLIER WITHDRAWAL OF THE </p><p>CASE, BECAUSE THE GOZ WAS NOT NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH. </p><p>THE GROUP URGED THE UNITED STATES TO ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI TO WEIGH IN FORCEFULLY WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, AND </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT SOUTH AFRICA\'S THREATENING A TOTAL CUTOFF </p><p>OF FUEL AND ELECTRICITY COULD CONVINCE THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT TO CHANGE COURSE.  THIS GROUP OF FARMERS HAS </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT FURTHER DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT WILL </p><p>LEAD NOWHERE AND IS CONVINCED THAT ONLY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON MUGABE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  WE BELIEVE IT </p><p>MIGHT BE TIME TO CONSIDER ENCOURAGING MBEKI AGAIN TO </p><p>WEIGH IN WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT, A COURSE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04818  01 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>ACTION ON WHICH WE WOULD WELCOME EMBASSY PRETORIA\'S AND </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S THINKING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) BOB HENSON, WHO OWNS A TOBACCO FARM NEAR DOMA, </p><p>SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS NORTHEAST OF HARARE, CALLED ON </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON AUGUST 28 TO BRIEF HIM ON CURRENT </p><p>LAND-RELATED DEVELOPMENTS.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MIKE </p><p>AURET, A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), ATTORNEY JEREMY </p><p>CALLOW, AND TWO COMMERCIAL FARMERS, JOHN TOPPING AND </p><p>PETER FORSYTHE.  THE AMBASSADOR WAS JOINED BY POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) JOHN TOPPING, WHO OWNS A FARM 75 KM NORTH OF THE </p><p>CAPITAL NEAR BINDURA, REPORTED THAT MOST OF THE PHYSICAL </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST FARMERS IN HIS AREA HAD STOPPED.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE NOW APPEARED TO BE TO MOVE </p><p>PEOPLE ONTO LAND AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO BUILD HOUSES. </p><p>SQUATTERS IN SOME AREAS WERE ARRIVING WITH CORRUGATED </p><p>IRON AND OTHERS WITH PRE-FAB HOUSING, TRANSPORTED THERE </p><p>BY GOVERNMENT VEHICLES.  HE CLAIMED THAT SOME OF THE SO- </p><p>CALLED WAR VETERANS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN LAND AND WOULD </p><p>DRIFT AWAY IF NOT CLOSELY SUPERVISED BY THOSE WHO HAD </p><p>BROUGHT THEM.  FARMERS ARE NOW GENERALLY REFUSING ALL </p><p>REQUESTS FROM WAR VETERANS FOR FOOD, MONEY, OR ANY OTHER </p><p>KINDS OF ASSISTANCE.  IN FACT, MANY HAVE DETERMINED NOT </p><p>TO SPEAK TO THE WAR VETERANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FORSYTHE, WHOSE FARM IS LOCATED SOME 40 KM EAST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04818  01 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>OF HARARE NEAR ARCTURUS, SAID THE WAR VETERANS IN HIS </p><p>AREA HAD ATTEMPTED TO FORCE A WORK STOPPAGE THE PREVIOUS </p><p>WEEK.  (NOTE: THE ARCTURUS AREA HAS BEEN A HOTBED OF </p><p>PROBLEMS SINCE THE FARM INVASIONS BEGAN.  END NOTE.) </p><p>FARM WORKERS, HOWEVER, HAD REFUSED TO BE INTIMIDATED, AND </p><p>PLANTING WAS CURRENTLY PROCEEDING.  HE SAID THE SITUATION </p><p>WAS DETERIORATING IN MASVINGO PROVINCE, IN SOUTH-CENTRAL </p><p>ZIMBABWE, WHERE WAR VETERANS WERE DOING SERIOUS DAMAGE ON </p><p>MANY FARMS.  MP AURET ADDED THAT A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>DESTRUCTION IS OCCURRING IN GAME RESERVES, WHERE </p><p>POACHING, AIDED BY GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, IS OUT OF </p><p>CONTROL.  STONE RIDGE FARM, ONE OF THOSE FROM WHICH </p><p>SQUATTERS WERE RECENTLY EVICTED, HAS BEEN REOCCUPIED AND </p><p>THE OWNER HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE </p><p>APPARENT EXPULSION OF CHENJERAI HUNZVI AS CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION.  AURET SAID THE ACTION HAD BEEN </p><p>PRECIPITATED BY WAR VETERANS ANGERED BY HUNZVI\'S </p><p>DICTATORIAL LEADERSHIP AND HIS ALLEGED MISAPPROPRIATION </p><p>OF FUNDS AT ZEXCOM, A COMPANY OWNED AND OPERATED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS.  AURET SAID THE ISSUE WAS FAR FROM OVER, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9954 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04818  02 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      PM-00    P-00     SP-00    STR-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------7F9C19  301023Z /38 </p><p>P 301023Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6968 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE, AND HOFFMAN BARAK </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMERS: A PLEA FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04818  02 OF 03  301023Z </p><p> </p><p>HOWEVER, AS HUNZVI WAS CHALLENGING THE ACTION AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE COULD REINSTATE HUNZVI ANY TIME HE </p><p>CHOSE. </p><p> </p><p>CFU\'S LEGAL CHALLENGE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED THAT THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) HAD RECENTLY WITHDRAWN ITS LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGE OF AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT. </p><p>HAD THE WITHDRAWAL CAUSED A SPLIT WITHIN THE CFU?  NO, </p><p>BOB HENSON REPLIED, MEMBERS OF THE CFU HAD RESOLVED THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES OVER THIS ISSUE AND REMAINED UNITED.  JEREMY </p><p>CALLOW SAID THE CFU PLANNED IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO TO </p><p>RESUBMIT ITS CASE CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF </p><p>THE AMENDMENTS TO THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, THE LEGAL </p><p>BASIS FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EFFORT.  THE CASE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN SEVERAL WEEKS </p><p>EARLIER, CALLOW SAID, IN AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE A CHANNEL </p><p>OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOZ.  (NOTE: CALLOW IS A </p><p>PROMINENT LOCAL LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED THE THREE </p><p>AMERICANS DETAINED HERE LAST YEAR ON WEAPONS CHARGES. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACCORDING TO CALLOW, IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT THE GOZ </p><p>IS NOT COMMUNICATING WITH THE CFU IN GOOD FAITH.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PAYS LIP SERVICE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>DIALOGUE, WHILE CONTINUING TO PERMIT LAND INVASIONS, AND </p><p>ANNOUNCING THAT IT WILL COMPENSATE SQUATTERS FOR PROPERTY </p><p>DAMAGED IN POLICE EVICTIONS THE WEEK OF AUGUST 21. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04818  02 OF 03  301023Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CALLOW HOPED THE COURTS WOULD ISSUE AN </p><p>INJUNCTION STOPPING THE CURRENT LAND ACQUISITION PROGRAM. </p><p>ASSUMING THE COURT RULED IN THE CFU\'S FAVOR, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASKED, DID CALLOW BELIEVE THE GOZ WOULD </p><p>COMPLY?  PROBABLY NOT, CALLOW RESPONDED, BUT IT WAS </p><p>CRUCIAL FOR HIS CLIENTS TO MAKE THEIR RECORD AND FOR THE </p><p>FARMERS\' OWN CREDIBILITY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>THAT THEY PURSUE EVERY POSSIBLE AVENUE OPEN TO THEM. </p><p> </p><p>FUEL AND ELECTRICITY CRUCIAL LEVERS WITH MUGABE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) AURET SAID ZIMBABWE WAS "ON ITS BACKSIDE" AND WAS </p><p>ABLE TO STAGGER ALONG PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>PROVISION OF FUEL AND ELECTRICITY.  TOPPING ADDED THAT </p><p>THE THREAT OF A TOTAL CUTOFF OF LIGHTS AND FUEL WAS </p><p>PERHAPS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE TOOL LEFT THAT MIGHT TURN </p><p>MUGABE AROUND.  THE TURMOIL IN ZIMBABWE WAS AFFECTING THE </p><p>ENTIRE REGION, AND HE HOPED THE UNITED STATES COULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE SOUTH AFRICA TO BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON </p><p>MUGABE.  HE AND THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, TOPPING SAID, </p><p>WERE TRYING NOT ONLY TO SAVE THEIR OWN LAND, BUT TO DO </p><p>ALL THEY COULD TO PREVENT THEIR COUNTRY FROM "GOING DOWN </p><p>THE TUBES." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PRESS THE GOZ AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS TO RESTORE THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW AND TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PUT THE ECONOMY </p><p>BACK ON TRACK.  OUR LEVERAGE IS LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS WE </p><p>PROVIDE NO DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  WE WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04818  02 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE COULD TO NUDGE MUGABE IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION, BUT SOUTH AFRICA IS THE KEY PLAYER HERE.  THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH PRESIDENT MBEKI </p><p>ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE AND HAS URGED HIM TO WEIGH </p><p>IN WITH MUGABE.  MBEKI HAS BEEN HELPFUL, BUT HE HAS TO BE </p><p>CAREFUL.  IF HE PUSHES TOO HARD, MUGABE IS CAPABLE OF </p><p>WITHDRAWING INTO A SHELL AND GOING IT ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THERE WAS A TONE OF DESPERATION AMONG THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP.  THEY REFLECT WIDESPREAD CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE SEVERE DAMAGE THE GOVERNMENT\'S HAPHAZARD </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EFFORT IS DOING TO FARMERS\' LIVELIHOODS, TO </p><p>AGRICULTURE, AND TO THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE.  THEY HAVE </p><p>LOST CONFIDENCE THAT ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, AND HAVE CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT ONLY PRESSURE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN </p><p>FORCE MUGABE TO CHANGE COURSE.  THE GROUP\'S SUGGESTION </p><p>THAT WE ENCOURAGE MBEKI AGAIN TO WEIGH IN WITH MUGABE </p><p>MERITS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, AND WE WOULD WELCOME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9955 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04818  03 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      PM-00    P-00     SP-00    STR-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------7F9C23  301023Z /38 </p><p>P 301023Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6969 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE, AND HOFFMAN BARAK </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/05 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMERS: A PLEA FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04818  03 OF 03  301023Z </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S AND EMBASSY PRETORIA\'S THINKING ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) DESPITE THIS GROUP\'S CONTENTION THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS IS GETTING WORSE, THE REAL </p><p>PICTURE IS ACTUALLY UNCLEAR.  THERE HAVE BEEN FEW NEW </p><p>FARM INVASIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE CFU, BUT NEITHER HAVE THERE BEEN ANY FURTHER POLICE </p><p>EVICTIONS OF WAR VETERANS SUBSEQUENT TO THOSE REPORTED IN </p><p>REF B.  IN AN ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT, POLICE IN MOST </p><p>PROVINCES ARE NOW RESPONDING WHEN SQUATTERS ENGAGE IN </p><p>CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INTERFERING WITH FARMING </p><p>OPERATIONS, ASSAULTING FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS, STEALING </p><p>PROPERTY, AND CUTTING DOWN TREES. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE QUESTION NOW, OF COURSE, IS HOW THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PLANS TO PROCEED.  AS INDICATED IN PREVIOUS </p><p>REPORTING, VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA, HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER </p><p>JOHN NKOMO, AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US </p><p>RECENTLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO MOVE SQUATTERS OFF </p><p>NON-DESIGNATED FARMS TO THOSE IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, HOWEVER, IS CLEARLY </p><p>UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT COURSE OF ACTION, AND WE HAVE NOT </p><p>YET SEEN ANY MOVEMENT IN THAT DIRECTION.   EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>GOZ TO ADDRESS THE LAND REFORM ISSUE IN A FAIR AND </p><p>TRANSPARENT WAY HAVE OCCURRED ONLY WHEN MUGABE IS OUT OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY AND HAVE BEEN REVERSED UPON HIS RETURN.  THE </p><p>EVICTIONS, FOR INSTANCE, WERE CARRIED OUT LAST WEEK WHILE </p><p>MUGABE WAS IN MOZAMBIQUE, BUT STOPPED WHEN HE CAME BACK. </p><p>THE RESULTING GOZ POLICY ON LAND IS CYCLICAL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04818  03 OF 03  301023Z </p><p>HAPHAZARD, IN WHICH IT REGULARLY TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD, </p><p>THEN TWO STEPS BACK.  WE NOTE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL </p><p>BE IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK FOR THE MILLENIUM SUMMIT.  HIS </p><p>ABSENCE COULD PROVIDE AN OPENING, ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY A </p><p>TEMPORARY ONE, FOR SOME POSITIVE MOVEMENT ON LAND. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
