<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 001047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, HR, UNSC, HRPREL, UNSC, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICC: STILL TAKING A TOUGH LINE ON ARTICLE </p><p>98 NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 92865 </p><p>     B. 02 STATE 253531 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 12 PRESSED DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 OR OTHER </p><p>NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT.  SHOULD CROATIA FAIL TO DO SO BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01047  01 OF 02  121715Z </p><p>JULY 1 WHEN THE AMERICAN SERVICEMEMBERS PROTECTION ACT COMES </p><p>INTO EFFECT, IT STANDS TO PUT AT RISK OVER USD 19 MILLION IN </p><p>FMF AND IMET ASSISTANCE (FY00 TO FY03) KEY TO ITS NATO </p><p>INTEGRATION ASPIRATIONS.  DFM SIMONOVIC SAID THAT ICTY </p><p>LINKAGES DURING AN ELECTION YEAR -- PARTICULARLY WHEN NEW </p><p>INDICTMENTS ARE EXPECTED -- AND THE GOC\'S DESIRE NOT TO GET </p><p>OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU MADE NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT ALMOST </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SIMONOVIC ASKED IF WASHINGTON MIGHT GRANT CROATIA AN </p><p>ASPA WAIVER -- EVEN FOR SIX MONTHS -- PARTICULARLY, HE </p><p>CLAIMED, SINCE THE GOC WAS SET TO UNDERTAKE A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROMISING, BUT POLITICALLY DIFFICULT, REFUGEE RETURN </p><p>INITIATIVES.  WHILE THE AMBASSADOR URGED SIMONOVIC TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE GOC\'S REFUGEE RETURN AGENDA (DESCRIBED SEPTEL), </p><p>THERE COULD BE NO LINKAGE BETWEEN THOSE EFFORTS AND AN ASPA </p><p>WAIVER.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE GOC HAD TO FIND A </p><p>WAY TO BALANCE ITS INTERESTS AND TO MANAGE LINKAGES TO ICTY. </p><p>RESPONDING TO SIMONOVIC, THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE HAD NO </p><p>INDICATION THAT THE EU WAS WORKING ON AN ARTICLE 98 </p><p>INITIATIVE FOR THESSALONIKI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PRESSING THE GOC ON ARTICLE 98 </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM AND POLOFF, CALLED </p><p>ON DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC ON MAY 12 TO PRESS </p><p>THE GOC TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 OR NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT. </p><p> THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFED THE DFM ON PROGRESS TO DATE -- 34 </p><p>AGREEMENTS SIGNED AND SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY WITH SOME </p><p>OF CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS.  TALKS WITH THE EU HAVE BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01047  01 OF 02  121715Z </p><p>FRUITFUL, BUT SCOPE OF COVERAGE ISSUES HAVE PREVENTED THE </p><p>U.S. FROM REACHING AN EU-MODEL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND </p><p>OTHER GOC OFFICIALS TOLD HIM IN 2002 THAT THEY WISHED TO </p><p>REACH AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, BUT THAT CROATIA DID NOT WANT </p><p>TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU AND, THEREFORE, PREFERRED TO </p><p>WAIT FOR AN EU-MODEL AGREEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT </p><p>WHAT WAS AN UNDERSTANDABLE POSITION LAST YEAR NOW MUST BE </p><p>RECONSIDERED:  BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN SERVICEMEMBERS </p><p>PROTECTION ACT (ASPA), CROATIA PUTS AT RISK OVER USD 19 </p><p>MILLION IN FMF AND IMET ASSISTANCE FROM FY 00 THROUGH FY 03. </p><p>CONSIDERING THE LIMITED SCOPE IN THE CROATIAN DEFENSE BUDGET </p><p>FOR NEW ACQUISITIONS, THIS ASSISTANCE IS CRITICAL FOR KEEPING </p><p>CROATIA\'S NATO INTEGRATION ASPIRATIONS ON TRACK.  NOBODY ELSE </p><p>WAS GIVING THAT NEEDED SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT THE GOC NEEDED TO REALIZE </p><p>THAT THE COUNTRIES THAT CROATIA IS LOOKING TO PAVE THE WAY </p><p>FOR IT WITHIN THE EU ARE UNAFFECTED BY ASPA.  MANY ARE EXEMPT </p><p>OF THE EFFECTS OF ASPA BECAUSE OF THEIR NATO MEMBERSHIP OR, </p><p>LIKE AUSTRIA, DO NOT RECEIVE FMF OR IMET ASSISTANCE.  THE DFM </p><p>AGREED THAT CROATIA WAS IN A DIFFICULT AND ISOLATED POSITION. </p><p> IT WAS AN "UNPLEASANT FEELING" TO BE A PRIMARY "TARGET," </p><p>ALBEIT INADVERTENTLY, OF THE ASPA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE DFM </p><p>SAID, THE GOC WAS HAMSTRUNG.  IN AN ELECTION YEAR, THE </p><p>SPECTER OF NEW ICTY INDICTMENTS AND DOMESTIC LINKAGES BETWEEN </p><p>THE ICC AND ICTY MAKE AN AGREEMENT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  THE </p><p>TYPE OF AGREEMENT, BE IT THE STANDARD OR UNILATERAL ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT OR THE "GENERIC" NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT, DID </p><p>NOT MATTER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01047  01 OF 02  121715Z </p><p> </p><p>A SIX-MONTH WAIVER PLEASE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SIMONOVIC LAUNCHED INTO A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A </p><p>NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES -- LARGELY FOCUSED ON REFUGEE </p><p>RETURN -- THAT HE SAID THE GOC PLANNED TO UNDERTAKE IN COMING </p><p>MONTHS (SEPTEL).  THESE INITIATIVES, HE ARGUED, WERE </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR CROATIA\'S EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP ASPIRATIONS </p><p>AND FOR REGIONAL STABILITY, BUT HAD THEIR OWN POLITICAL COST </p><p>FOR THE GOC.  IN LIGHT OF THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO BE SCHEDULED IN NOVEMBER, AND THE DIFFICULTY FOR </p><p>THE GOC OF IMPLEMENTING THOSE NEW INITIATIVES, WOULD IT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR WASHINGTON TO CONSIDER ISSUING A SIX-MONTH </p><p>WAIVER ASPA FOR CROATIA, SIMONOVIC ASKED.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>SIMONOVIC ASKED IF WE HAD RECEIVED ANY INDICATION THAT THE EU </p><p>LAUNCH AN INITIATIVE ON ARTICLE 98 AT THE UPCOMING EU SUMMIT </p><p>IN THESSALONIKI. (HE DID NOT ELABORATE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THERE COULD BE NO LINKAGE </p><p>BETWEEN OTHER CROATIA FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES AND OUR NEED </p><p>TO CONCLUDE A BILATERAL NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT.  THERE WAS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0745 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01047  02 OF 02  121715Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PM-00    SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /004W </p><p>                  ------------------63C145  121716Z /38 </p><p>P 121702Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0167 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, UNSC, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICC: STILL TAKING A TOUGH LINE ON ARTICLE </p><p>98 NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>LITTLE POINT IN DISCUSSING WHAT SHORT-TERM WAIVERS FOR </p><p>ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE CROATIA HASN\'T </p><p>EVEN BEGUN TO NEGOTIATE.  IN ANY CASE, ALL INDICATIONS WERE </p><p>THAT ASPA WAIVERS WOULD BE FEW, AND, IF ANY WERE TO BE </p><p>ISSUED, NATO INVITEES WOULD HAVE PRIORITY BEFORE CROATIA. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT NO DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN ON </p><p>WHO, IF ANYONE WOULD GET A WAIVER. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SIMONOVIC THAT WHILE WE BELIEVED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01047  02 OF 02  121715Z </p><p>CROATIA\'S EU AND ICTY CONCERNS WERE UNDERSTANDABLE, THEY ALSO </p><p>HAD TO BE PUT  PERSPECTIVE.  OUR SENSE WAS THAT WE WOULD </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EU ON ARTICLE 98 </p><p>WELL BEFORE BRUSSELS WOULD CONSIDER CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP. </p><p>GOOD ARGUMENTS DIFFERENTIATED THE ICTY AND THE ICC; IT WOULD </p><p>BE UP TO THE GOC TO CRAFT A MESSAGE THAT WOULD RESONATE WITH </p><p>THE CROATIAN PUBLIC.   THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT HE HAD </p><p>RECEIVED NO INFORMATION THAT THE EU WOULD ALTER ITS POSITION </p><p>ON ARTICLE 98 IN THESSALONIKI. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGAIN URGED DFM SIMONOVIC TO REVIEW THE </p><p>VARIOUS AGREEMENT TEXTS WE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE GOC TO BEGIN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH US ON AN AGREEMENT.  SIMONOVIC WAS NOT </p><p>OPTIMISTIC, SAYING THAT, UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS, HE COULD </p><p>NOT SEE THE GOC AGREEING TO A NON-EXTRADITION AGREEMENT, </p><p>IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) SIMONOVIC\'S GAMBIT OF LINKING AN ASPA WAIVER TO GOC </p><p>PROGRESS ON CORE REGIONAL STABILITY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO </p><p>US WAS A GOOD TRY FROM THE CROATIAN PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOC </p><p>DOES NOT WANT TO EXPEND WHAT IT IMAGINES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>POLITICAL CAPITAL -- BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND IN TERMS OF ITS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU -- TO SIGN A NON-SURRENDER </p><p>AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) NOW THAT WE DISPENSED WITH THE GOC\'S MANEUVER, </p><p>HOWEVER, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THE GOC STICKS </p><p>TO THE NO-NEGOTIATIONS POLICY THAT SIMONOVIC DESCRIBED.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01047  02 OF 02  121715Z </p><p>GOC KNOWS WHAT THE STAKES ARE AND HOW LITTLE CHANCE CROATIA </p><p>HAS FOR A WAIVER.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE GOC TO FIND </p><p>A WAY TO BALANCE ITS INTERESTS AND BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT WITH US.  PROSPECTS CANNOT BE </p><p>CONSIDERED GOOD.  PM RACAN IS NEVER EAGER TO RISK DOMESTIC </p><p>PROBLEMS OVER ICTY, AND SIMONOVIC INADVERTENTLY REITERATED </p><p>THAT THE GOC\'S EU BID COUNTS FOR MORE THAN NATO -- IN SPITE </p><p>OF REPEATING LEADING REFERENCES BY THE AMBASSADOR, SIMONOVIC </p><p>NEVER ONCE REFERRED TO CROATIA\'S MAP PROCESS AS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>GOC PRIORITY. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
