<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, DS/DSS/ITA AND DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CLASH OVER LAND CLAIMS LIVES IN TARABA </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) During the January 5-6 weekend, communal violence in </p><p>Taraba State between Fulani cattle herders and ethnic Kakawa </p><p>farmers claimed at least 25 lives, perhaps as many as 50. </p><p>The locus of the fighting was Gembu, Sardauna Local </p><p>Government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a January 8 conversation, Taraba State </p><p>Governor Nyame told Emboffs that the melee was the outgrowth </p><p>of a contest over land use. Friction was inherent between </p><p>cattle herders and farmers when land runs scarce, he claimed. </p><p> As the dry season progressed, tensions escalated.  Grazing </p><p>land had become parched and unable to sustain livestock. </p><p>Searching to feed their animals, herders drove the cattle </p><p>closer to the streams where the herds could feed on the </p><p>vegetation still growing because of its proximity to water. </p><p>Unfortunately, many farms lay near the water for the same </p><p>reason.  As cattle were driven through the area, they began </p><p>to eat the crops, according to Nyame.  Enraged by the </p><p>herders\' perceived encroachment and fearing decimation of </p><p>their crops by hungry cattle, some farmers struck back, Nyame </p><p>continued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Unfortunately, the division of labor along ethnic </p><p>lines in this rural community only exacerbated the tension, </p><p>according to the Governor.  The vast majority of cattle </p><p>herders were Fulani while most farmers were of Kakawa stock. </p><p>The Kakawa consider themselves indigenes and resent the </p><p>Fulani as immigrants.  However, the Fulani tend to be more </p><p>prosperous and have come to dominate the politics and economy </p><p>of the area.  This Fulani dominance has stirred bitterness </p><p>among the Kakawa, Nyame said.  (Comment: taxes on cattle </p><p>provide the major source of indigenous revenue to the </p><p>Sardauna LGA.  Subsistence farmers are not taxed, so ethnic </p><p>issues aside, the LGA would have an incentive to increase </p><p>cattle numbers at the expense of farms.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Fulani\'s relative prosperity has brought more and </p><p>more cattle into the area and a concomitant need for </p><p>additional grazing land. Because of the finite amount of </p><p>suitable land, the farmers realize that more grazing means </p><p>less farming.  Seeing themselves on the wrong side of this </p><p>dynamic, the farmers feel their lands, their way of life, and </p><p>their role in local affairs are being imperiled.  Moreover, </p><p>the Kakawa have also felt slighted because the traditional </p><p>ruler in the area is Fulani and not one of their own. </p><p>Although terribly wrong-minded, their resort to violence was </p><p>not to seek dominance but an act born of political weakness </p><p>and desperation.  It was an attempt to do something to halt </p><p>the further erosion of their status, Nyame contended. </p><p>(Comment: Media reports lend credence to the view that the </p><p>clash had economic and political dimensions extending beyond </p><p>the actual land in dispute.  According to the January 7 "New </p><p>Nigerian", several prominent local Fulani leaders were among </p><p>those attacked and killed in what appears to be a </p><p>premeditated plan.  Nyame also told us a very prosperous </p><p>Fulani businessman, who employed many Kakawa, had his office </p><p>burned down.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nyame added that another factor contributing to the </p><p>belligerent mood was that traders and herders from Cameroon </p><p>were trundling across the international boundary to set up in </p><p>the area, which is less that 10 miles away from the border. </p><p>The growing Cameroonian presence not only intensified the </p><p>competition for resources but deepened the sense of loss felt </p><p>by the Kakawa due to incursion by "foreigners." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The area was now calm, Nyame stated.  In a public </p><p>statement, Taraba State Police Commissioner Egbe Njom said </p><p>that they held nearly 50 suspects who claim to have been </p><p>hired by one of the sides in the conflict.  (Comment: Njom\'s </p><p>statement contradicts an assertion the Governor made to us </p><p>that he did not believe  "mercenaries" were involved in the </p><p>fracas.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Nyame claimed he was very disappointed by the violence </p><p>as he considered the Sardauna Local Government Area one of </p><p>the best in his state.  Asked how he could prevent repeat </p><p>violence, Nyame stated he would take three steps.  First, he </p><p>would seek to gerrymander one or two additional local </p><p>governments out of the present one ( this would require State </p><p>Assembly approval).  In that way, the Kakawa could have a </p><p>Local Government (and resources) that they would control. </p><p>Second, he would establish a Kakawa "traditional ruler." </p><p>Nyame believed bestowing this recognition would reduce Kakawa </p><p>ire by elevating them to the same status as the Fulani who </p><p>have a local traditional ruler.  Third, he would increase </p><p>dialogue between moderate Fulani and Kakawa.  By bolstering </p><p>the moderates, he hoped to lessen the influence of hot heads </p><p>on both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The conflict between herders and farmers over </p><p>scarce land is being played out in many Nigerian communities. </p><p> As in Taraba, many of these perennial disputes have ethnic </p><p>ramifications and also have transgressed into the political </p><p>arena -- with rival ethnic groups seeking control of their </p><p>local government, and each group trying to exclude the other. </p><p> Unfortunately, as we move deeper into the dry season, more </p><p>of these simmering disputes likely may erupt into violence. </p><p>It will take mutually acceptable resolution of land use </p><p>disputes in each area to diminish these problems. However, </p><p>these compromises are difficult to achieve and slow to take </p><p>shape. And meanwhile, the best the GON can do will be to </p><p>respond quickly to any reported outbreaks in hopes of keeping </p><p>them from spreading and claiming too many casualties.  What </p><p>Taraba State Governor Nyame has done in his state seems to be </p><p>a positive way forward. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
