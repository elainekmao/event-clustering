<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, MASS, MOPS, LI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- PRESIDENT OBASANJO CONFIRMS </p><p>TAYLOR\'S ASYLUM OFFER AND NIGERIA\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>DEPLOY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B & D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a July 5 afternoon meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo stated that, </p><p>despite the concerns of his security staff, he was </p><p>committed to travelling to Monrovia to confer with </p><p>Charles Taylor. He saw Taylor\'s extraction from </p><p>Monrovia as an essential cog in the evolving peace </p><p>machinery. However, Obasanjo noted that the situation </p><p>was extremely complex and that Taylor\'s military </p><p>machine, the LURD\'s and MODEL\'s, also needed to be </p><p>dismantled for peace to stand a chance. Obasanjo </p><p>claimed he would face domestic criticism for his </p><p>active involvement in Liberia but that he could </p><p>withstand the flak. He would move forward with </p><p>offering Taylor asylum and with planning to deploy two </p><p>battalions to Liberia if sufficient logistical </p><p>assistance was provided by the international </p><p>community. Discussion of the fuel price strike and </p><p>other domestic political issues will be reported </p><p>septel. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO ON HIS WAY TO MONROVIA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. 2. (C) During a lengthy July 5 conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo revealed his </p><p>plans to visit Liberia to confer with Charles Taylor </p><p>at Robertsfield. Relaxed and unusually affable, </p><p>Obasanjo said he had overridden his security officer\'s </p><p>concerns that Taylor could not guarantee his security </p><p>or that Taylor might somehow manufacture an incident </p><p>for which he would blame the LURD. Ambassador Jeter </p><p>told Obasanjo Embassy Monrovia had reported that </p><p>Monrovia had been peaceful the past few days and that </p><p>commercial flights were landing at Robertsfield. With </p><p>that information, Obasanjo reconfirmed that he would </p><p>proceed to Monrovia. (NOTE: Ambassador Jeter </p><p>subsequently called the Department again to ask that </p><p>Embassy Monrovia approach the GOL on the need for </p><p>beefed up security to cover the Obasanjo-Taylor </p><p>meeting.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The purpose of the visit to Monrovia was </p><p>two-fold, Obasanjo said. First he would renew his </p><p>offer of exile to the Liberian leader.  Obasanjo </p><p>elaborated that he was willing to give Taylor an exit </p><p>in order to stave off catastrophe in Monrovia.  If </p><p>Taylor were left without any option save the War Crime </p><p>Tribunal, Obasanjo feared Taylor would prolong the </p><p>fighting, dragging the country further down the path </p><p>toward chaos.  However, Obasanjo was emphatic that a </p><p>mechanism should be found to render the Tribunal\'s </p><p>indictment "inactive."  He did not want to offer </p><p>Taylor exile, only to find himself hounded by the </p><p>international community to relinquish the Liberian </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Second, he was going to Liberia because he </p><p>wanted to know exactly what Taylor wanted. Through </p><p>Taylor\'s emissaries who had visited Abuja and his </p><p>previous conversations with Taylor, Obasanjo noted </p><p>that Taylor\'s position had been that departure prior </p><p>to deployment of an international force would be </p><p>premature and dangerous. It would create a power </p><p>vacuum. Also, Taylor envisioned leaving Liberia with </p><p>more than his immediate family.  He apparently wanted </p><p>to take much of his inner circle as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WHAT OF TAYLOR\'S INNER CIRCLE? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter emphasized the importance of </p><p>not solely focusing on Taylor\'s exit as the solution </p><p>to Liberia\'s violent conundrum.  Taylor\'s removal was </p><p>essential but did not constitute the entire machinery </p><p>of peace. Prior to Taylor\'s departure, there must be </p><p>an agreement on disarmament and demobilization; </p><p>moreover, Taylor must lend his active imprimatur for </p><p>his men to yield their weapons. Second, consideration </p><p>must be given to the problem of Taylor insiders and </p><p>notorious henchmen Benjamin Yeaten, J.T. Richardson </p><p>and the like. These men have been with Taylor for </p><p>years; they bear his mark and many have committed </p><p>atrocities in his and in their own names; they too </p><p>could be brought before the Special Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) To extract Taylor, yet leave them behind could </p><p>simply invite continued fighting. The situation could </p><p>become even more chaotic because of the possibility of </p><p>Taylor\'s machine dividing into smaller, even rival </p><p>groups, each controlled by one of Taylor\'s lieutenants </p><p>who would have assumed the status of an independent </p><p>petty warlord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In addition to providing for Taylor\'s exit, any </p><p>tenable peace arrangement had to ensure that his chief </p><p>lieutenants did not remain negative factors in the </p><p>Liberia equation. For instance, if Nigeria choose to </p><p>grant asylum to a larger number of people, they would </p><p>have to actively push their forces to begin </p><p>disarmament and demobilization before they would be </p><p>granted exile along with Taylor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>LURD AND MODEL - BAD OLD WINE IN BAD NEW BOTTLES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter continued that LURD and MODEL </p><p>disarmament required as much attention as the GOL\'s. </p><p>Disarming them would have to be simultaneous, since it </p><p>was unlikely that Taylor partisans would disarm if </p><p>their enemies still retained their weapons. Both the </p><p>LURD and MODEL were headed by known miscreants, who </p><p>wanted power, preferably by the force of arms.  Their </p><p>hope remained that they could sneak through the back </p><p>door of the presidential mansion while everyone\'s </p><p>attention was focused on escorting Taylor out the </p><p>front. The LURD need to be pressured to disarm and its </p><p>benefactors needed to turn off their support.  Both </p><p>rebel forces should be converted into political </p><p>parties if their officials want to hold office. Any </p><p>peace plan should avoid their inclusion in an interim </p><p>or transitional government if at all possible, Jeter </p><p>posited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THOUGHTS ON THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Regarding a transitional government, Obasanjo </p><p>felt that Liberia should follow a constitutionally- </p><p>scripted succession, leaving Vice President Moses Blah </p><p>as the transitional Head of State. Ambassador Jeter </p><p>agreed but cautioned that Blah\'s appointment must be </p><p>worked delicately, given the ethnic dynamics of </p><p>Liberia. He explained that Blah was an ethnic Gio for </p><p>Nimba Country, the bedrock of Taylor\'s political and </p><p>military support. Krahn personalities in LURD and </p><p>MODEL, and to a certain extent, Mandingos in LURD, </p><p>would be wary of Blah.  With a Gio as Head of State, </p><p>no Krahn and few Mandingos would be eager to disarm </p><p>unless they were given adequate assurances regarding </p><p>their personal security. Additionally, this could </p><p>exacerbate tension along the common border between </p><p>Nimba (Gio/Mano) and Grand Gedeh (Krahn) countries, </p><p>possible spilling over to Cote d\' Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Last, Blah has the reputation of a cipher.  An </p><p>interim government under his leadership would not </p><p>command much respect or confidence; despite the uneasy </p><p>relationship between Taylor and Blah, many Liberians </p><p>would suspect that Taylor still would be pulling the </p><p>strings, albeit from a distance. Obasanjo said that he </p><p>appreciated the advice and would consider these </p><p>admonitions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIA: COMMITTED TO DEPLOY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo confirmed that he was prepared to </p><p>send two Nigerian battalions to Liberia.  He also made </p><p>a strong pitch for American boots on the ground, </p><p>stating that this would be of tremendous military and </p><p>psychological value in making all armed groups behave. </p><p>Obasanjo added, however, that Nigeria would only </p><p>deploy if provided the needed logistical support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Obasanjo added that Libyan leader Quadhafi had </p><p>written him, asking that Nigeria oppose deployment of </p><p>U.S. troops in Liberia.  Obasanjo sardonically </p><p>remarked that he told the Libyan to communicate </p><p>directly with President Bush and not use him as an </p><p>intermediary.  In a more serious vein, Obasanjo </p><p>observed that Taylor had been talking with Tripoli. </p><p>Obasanjo thought Quadhafi would provide some financial </p><p>support to help smooth Taylor\'s asylum but that </p><p>Tripoli would not assist in prolonging Taylor in </p><p>power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ASYLUM REVISITED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Returning to the issue of Taylor\'s exile, </p><p>Obasanjo said he had spent a lot of time thinking </p><p>where to situate Taylor in Nigeria.  At one point, he </p><p>considered Katsina but thought the Moslem North would </p><p>be too uncomfortable for Taylor and his cabal. </p><p>Obasanjo finally decided on Calabar, Cross Rivers </p><p>State.  There was sufficient land for Taylor to pursue </p><p>his farming and the climate and culture would be more </p><p>akin to Liberia than any place in Northern Nigeria. </p><p>Whatever location was selected, Nigeria had to make </p><p>sure Taylor was safe but also sufficiently isolated </p><p>and contained so that he could not interfere in </p><p>Liberia, Jeter stressed.  Obasanjo responded that </p><p>Lagos was not an option because of this fear. </p><p>Obasanjo added that Cross Rivers Governor Donald Duke </p><p>was sufficiently adept to keep Taylor within </p><p>acceptable bounds of behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) While many Nigerians do not favor active re- </p><p>engagement in Liberia, President Obasanjo sees the </p><p>need and clearly recognizes that Nigeria is an </p><p>essential actor to ending the slide in Liberia.  He </p><p>has taken a forward leaning stance on troop </p><p>contributions.  Moreover, beyond the establishment of </p><p>a peacekeeping force, Obasanjo\'s exile offer to Taylor </p><p>may be the most important single step in injecting the </p><p>peace process with some momentum and giving the </p><p>Liberian people some hope that change is imminent. </p><p>While the War Crimes Tribunal indictment is </p><p>unassailable and should not be ignored or dismissed, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s asylum offer may be helpful to reaching a </p><p>solution in Liberia.  We should do all that we can to </p><p>encourage Obasanjo to continue the leading role he </p><p>seems willing to play. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
