<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000660 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE INSCRUTABLE ASAD REGIME </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  RUSSIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>ENJOYING TIES OF LONG STANDING TO THE SYRIAN </p><p>MILITARY/SECURITY ELITE, ARE, LIKE US, FINDING IT </p><p>DIFFICULT TO SORT FACT FROM FICTION REGARDING THE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF BASIL AL-ASAD\'S DEATH.  RUSSIAN DCM </p><p>MIKHAIL BOGDANOV RELATED THEIR BELIEF THAT BASHAR </p><p>AL-ASAD WAS THRUST TO THE FORE AFTER HIS FATHER </p><p>LEARNED THAT TWO SENIOR COMMANDERS HAD INCREASED </p><p>THE ALERT STATUS OF THEIR TROOPS IMMEDIATELY </p><p>FOLLOWING BASIL\'S DEATH.  THEY ALLEGEDLY DID SO IN </p><p>ORDER TO ENSURE THAT RIF\'AT DID NOT MOUNT A </p><p>COMEBACK.  BOGDANOV ALSO BELIEVED THAT MAJOR </p><p>GENERAL KHALID HUSAYN, THE LONG-TIME COMMANDER OF </p><p>ASAD\'S BODYGUARDS, HAD BEEN RELIEVED OF HIS </p><p>COMMAND FOR CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY OF </p><p>REPUBLICAN GUARD COMMANDER ADNAN MAKHLUF, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER-IN-LAW.  AS FOR SUCCESSION </p><p>SCENARIOS, THE RUSSIANS SEEM AS PUZZLED AS MOST, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY CLEARLY HAVE BEEN DOING SOME </p><p>SPECULATING OF THEIR OWN.  THEY BELIEVE IN </p><p>TENTATIVE FASHION THAT THE CLIQUE OF SENIOR </p><p>ALAWITES AROUND ASAD WILL BE WARY ABOUT ALLOWING A </p><p>SUNNI TO BECOME EVEN A FIGUREHEAD PRESIDENT, BUT </p><p>NEITHER DO THEY SEE THE ALAWITE INNER CIRCLE AS </p><p>HAVING ANYONE POSSESSING THE REQUISITE ATTRIBUTES </p><p>TO LEAD A POST-ASAD SYRIA.  THEY ARE NOW LOOKING </p><p>AT SENIOR ALAWITE CIVILIANS ON THE REGIONAL </p><p>COMMAND OF THE BA\'TH PARTY.  WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO FORECAST A </p><p>LIKELY REPLACEMENT FOR PRESIDENT ASAD.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF THE MILITARY AND </p><p>SECURITY ELITE AROUND PRESIDENT ASAD CONTINUE TO </p><p>CHALLENGE SOME OF THE BEST POSITIONED DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS HERE, DESPITE THE REGIME\'S 24 YEARS IN </p><p>POWER.  AMONG THOSE CONFIRMING THIS FACT (IN A </p><p>MEETING WITH THE DCM FEBRUARY 2) IS RUSSIAN DCM </p><p>MIKHAIL BOGDANOV, WHO HAS SPENT TWO LENGTHY TOURS </p><p>HERE AND WHO HAS HAD ACCESS AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER </p><p>TO MANY SENIOR REGIME FIGURES.  (BOGDANOV </p><p>ACCOMPANIED RIF\'AT AL-ASAD ON THE PLANE THAT TOOK </p><p>HIM TO MOSCOW IN 1984 TO BEGIN HIS FIRST PERIOD OF </p><p>EXILE.  GENERALS ALI HAYDAR AND SHAFIQ FAYYAD WERE </p><p>ALSO ON THAT FLIGHT, ALTHOUGH THEY, OF COURSE, </p><p>WERE NOT EXILED.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  NEVERTHELESS, BOGDANOV ADMITTED THAT HIS </p><p>EMBASSY REMAINED HARD PRESSED TO SORT OUT THE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF BASIL AL-ASAD\'S DEATH, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AS IT AFFECTS REGIME SUCCESSION SCENARIOS.  HE, </p><p>TOO, BELIEVES THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO ASSUME THAT </p><p>THE NEXT ELDEST SON, BASHAR, WILL BECOME AN </p><p>IMPORTANT PLAYER, DESPITE THE RECENT PROMINENCE </p><p>ACCORDED HIM AND HIS ASSUMPTION OF BASIL\'S FORMER </p><p>COMMAND AS HEAD OF A BRIGADE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN </p><p>GUARDS (SEE DAMASCUS 558).  BOGDANOV BELIEVES, AS </p><p>DO WE, THAT BASHAR\'S ROLE MAY INITIALLY BE </p><p>INTENDED TO KEEP REGIME RIVALRIES IN CHECK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TO BUTTRESS HIS THESIS, BOGDANOV RELATED A </p><p>STORY THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM, TO </p><p>THE EFFECT THAT THE NEW THIRD CORPS COMMANDER </p><p>SHAFIQ FAYYAD AND SPECIAL FORCES COMMANDER ALI </p><p>HAYDAR RAISED THE ALERT STATUS OF THEIR TROOPS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING OF BASIL\'S DEATH IN AN </p><p>AUTO ACCIDENT.  THE PRESIDENT, HEARING OF THEIR </p><p>ACTION, ALLEGEDLY QUESTIONED THE REASONS FOR IT </p><p>AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY FEARED RIF\'AT MIGHT SOMEHOW </p><p>TRY TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION.  IT WAS AT THIS </p><p>POINT, THE RUSSIAN CONTENDED, THAT PRESIDENT ASAD </p><p>MADE THE DECISION TO PUSH BASHAR TO THE FORE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONTINUING IN THIS VEIN, BOGDANOV ALSO RELATED </p><p>TWO DIFFERENT RUMORS CONCERNING THE HEAD OF ASAD\'S </p><p>PERSONAL BODYGUARDS, KHALID HUSAYN, WHO HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN SEEN SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  ONE </p><p>RUMOR WAS THAT HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK (WE HAD </p><p>ALREADY HEARD THIS ONE); THE SECOND VERSION WAS </p><p>THAT HE HAD ASSERTED FOR HIMSELF A POSITION </p><p>SUPERIOR TO REPUBLICAN GUARD COMMANDER (AND ASAD </p><p>BROTHER-IN-LAW) ADNAN MAKHLUF AND BEEN RELIEVED OF </p><p>HIS DUTIES AS A RESULT.  (COMMENT: WHATEVER THE </p><p>FACTS, KHALID HUSAYN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GUARDING </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 6, DURING KING </p><p>HUSSAYN\'S VISIT TO DAMASCUS.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIANS WERE NOT AT QARDAHA FOR </p><p>THE FUNERAL SERVICE, UPON HEARING FROM US THAT </p><p>GENERAL ADNAN AL-ASAD, A NEPHEW OF THE PRESIDENT </p><p>HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS (SUCH AS </p><p>THEY WERE), BOGDANOV CLAIMED THAT ADNAN\'S ONCE </p><p>BRIGHT STAR AS HEAD OF THE "STRUGGLE COMPANIES" </p><p>WAS IN ECLIPSE.  HE FINGERED HIM AND GHAZI KAN\'AN, </p><p>THE SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE CZAR IN LEBANON, AS BOTH </p><p>DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING BEEN PASSED OVER ON THE </p><p>LATEST PROMOTION LIST.  (COMMENT: WE DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO FARED ANY WORSE THAN MOST </p><p>OF THEIR PEERS IN THE LATEST PROMOTION CYCLE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN SPEAKING OF CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS OF </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD, BOGDANOV RELATED ANOTHER RUMOR </p><p>THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING: THE REASON THE YOUNGEST </p><p>ASAD CHILD, MAJID, HAD NOT BEEN AT THE FUNERAL WAS </p><p>THAT HE, HIMSELF, HAD BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT A </p><p>COUPLE OF WEEKS EARLIER AND HAD REQUIRED </p><p>HOSPITALIZATION IN GERMANY.  PRESIDENT ASAD HAD </p><p>ASKED BASIL TO LOOK AFTER MAJID\'S NEEDS, HENCE </p><p>THAT IS WHY BASIL WAS SPEEDING TO CATCH THE FRIDAY </p><p>MORNING LUFTHANSA FLIGHT TO FRANKFURT.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WE, TOO, HEARD THE STORY OF MAJID\'S ACCIDENT, BUT </p><p>SEEMINGLY MORE RELIABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>THIS STORY WAS INTENDED TO COVER MAJID\'S DRUG </p><p>REHABILITATION TREATMENT IN GERMANY.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  AS FOR SUCCESSION, BOGDANOV ADMITTED THAT HIS </p><p>EMBASSY WAS AS BEREFT OF RELIABLE INFORMATION AS </p><p>MOST OTHERS.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE CLIQUE OF </p><p>ALAWITE SENIOR OFFICERS WOULD SEE IT AS TOO </p><p>THREATENING TO ALLOW A PROMINENT REGIME SUNNI, </p><p>SUCH AS VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM OR ARMED FORCES </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF SHIHABI, TO ASCEND TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  EVEN A FRONT MAN COULD GET IDEAS. </p><p>YET, BOGDANOV CLAIMED, HE WAS HARD PRESSED TO </p><p>IDENTIFY A SENIOR ALAWITE OFFICER WITH THE </p><p>STATURE, POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, AND REPUTATION TO </p><p>SUCCEED ASAD.  GENERAL MAKHLUF LACKED THE DIRECT </p><p>COMBAT EXPERIENCE OF HIS PEERS.  RIF\'AT REMAINED A </p><p>DIVISIVE FIGURE.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT DEPUTY CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF ALI ASLAN, BOGDANOV SAID THAT HE MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN "RETIRED" BUT ALLOWED TO STAY ON AN EXTRA </p><p>YEAR.  AT THE MOMENT BOGDANOV UNDERSTOOD ASLAN WAS </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH THE HEALTH OF A SON WHO WAS IN </p><p>DANGER OF DYING FROM A LONG-TERM ILLNESS </p><p>(UNSPECIFIED). </p><p> </p><p>10.  BOGDANOV SAID THAT IN HIS EMBASSY\'S MUSINGS </p><p>ON A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IZZ AL-DIN NASIR WAS </p><p>TOUTED AS A REAL CONTENDER.  WHEN ASKED WHY NASIR, </p><p>THE LONG-TIME PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL </p><p>CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, WAS SEEN AS A </p><p>CONTENDER, BOGDANOV REPLIED THAT HE MET THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF MEMBERSHIP ON THE </p><p>REGIONAL COMMAND OF THE BA\'TH PARTY; ENJOYED THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF SEVERAL SENIOR ALAWITE OFFICERS, MOST </p><p>IMPORTANTLY SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA; WAS POPULAR AMONG </p><p>THE PARTY RANK AND FILE; AND, OF COURSE, WAS AN </p><p>ALAWITE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  WE REPORT BOGDANOV\'S OBSERVATIONS </p><p>PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE RATHER UNREMARKABLE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY COMING FROM A VETERAN SYRIA WATCHER </p><p>WHO HAS HAD DIRECT ACCESS OVER THE YEARS TO SENIOR </p><p>MILITARY OFFICIALS AND TO THE REPORTS OF THE LARGE </p><p>SOVIET ADVISORY GROUP THAT HAS WORKED WITH THE </p><p>SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.  BOGDANOV CLEARLY WAS HAVING </p><p>THE SAME PROBLEMS MOST OF HIS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COLLEAGUES HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN SIFTING FACT FROM </p><p>FICTION IN A SOCIETY WHERE INFORMATION IS AS </p><p>TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AS WAS FORMERLY THE CASE IN </p><p>SOME OF THE MORE REPRESSIVE EASTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>STATES.  THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY APPEARS GENUINELY </p><p>UNABLE TO LAY ODDS ON POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF BASIL\'S UNTIMELY DEMISE.  ALL OF THE </p><p>FOREGOING SUGGESTS TO US THAT A HEALTHY DOSE OF </p><p>HUMILITY, CAUTION, AND SKEPTICISM IS CALLED FOR IN </p><p>HANDICAPPING THE SUCCESSION SWEEPSTAKES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AMBASSADOR\'S COMMENT:  AT A FEBRUARY 1 DINNER </p><p>MEETING OF THE RUSSIAN, FRENCH, BRITISH, EGYPTIAN, </p><p>AND US AMBASSADORS, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ZOTOV </p><p>SHARED MOST OF BOGDANOV\'S INFORMATION AND MUSINGS </p><p>AS HIS OWN, AGAIN WITH LITTLE SENSE OF HOW ANY </p><p>SUCCESSION SCENARIO MIGHT PLAY OUT.  WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF BRITISH AMBASSADOR GREEN, WHO </p><p>BELIEVES THAT RIF\'AT AL-ASAD COULD PROVE TO BE THE </p><p>ALAWITES\' RALLYING-POINT WHEN HAFIZ AL-ASAD PASSES </p><p>AWAY, NONE OF THE AMBASSADORS PRESENT WAS PREPARED </p><p>TO PUT FORTH ANYTHING APPROACHING A DEFINITIVE </p><p>VIEW OF THE SUCCESSION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
