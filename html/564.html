<p>UNCLAS RABAT 011918 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MO </p><p>SUBJECT: 1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 338430 </p><p> </p><p>1.   POST RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS LISTED IN REFTEL PARA </p><p>5. </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE ARE AWARE OF NO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>B.  WE KNOW OF NO EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THAT WERE </p><p>CARRIED OUT OR REQUESTED IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>C.  THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p>MOROCCO DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S., BUT </p><p>WOULD LIKELY COOPERATE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH ANY REQUEST </p><p>FOR THE EXTRADITION OF A TERRORIST. </p><p> </p><p>D.  THE GOM HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>RESPOND TO SECURITY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING </p><p>POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS.  IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE GOM </p><p>PREFERS TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES QUIETLY AND DOES NOT ISSUE PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ON SECURITY ISSUES.  IN APRIL 1992 MOROCCAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO THE UNSC DID PUBLICLY CONDEMN THE ATTACK BY AN </p><p>ORGANIZED MOB ON THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI, WHICH </p><p>FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE OF UN SECURITY COUNCIL (UNSC) RESOLUTION </p><p>731.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE GOM REPRESENTATIVES URGED </p><p>THAT THE UNSC TAKE NOTE OF LIBYAN PROMISES TO BRING TO JUSTICE </p><p>THOSE RESPONSIBLE, PROVIDE COMPENSATION AND OFFER PROTECTION IN </p><p>THE FUTURE.  IN SEPTEMBER 1992 THE MOROCCAN PRESS REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE GOM HAD PROTESTED TO SUDANESE AUTHORITIES (AUG/SEP 92) THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF MOROCCAN OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN SUPPOSED IRANIAN </p><p>BACKED TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>E.  THE GOM PARTICIPATES AS AN OBSERVER IN THE ANNUAL MINISTERIAL </p><p>CONFERENCE OF THE TREVI GROUP.  THE U.S. AND MOROCCO MAINTAIN AN </p><p>ONGOING BILATERAL DIALOGUE ON COUNTER-TERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>F.  THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, EITHER </p><p>RHETORICALLY OR MATERIALLY.  MOROCCANS ARE ALWAYS PROUD TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE THAT NO TERRORIST INCIDENT HAS EVER OCCURRED IN MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p>MOROCCO STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PALESTINIANS\' CLAIM TO SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION AND CONSIDERS THE PLO THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  MOROCCO HAS LONG WORKED TO MODERATE </p><p>THE PLO, HOWEVER, AND SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT </p><p>OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  MOROCCO HAS REGULAR HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE PLO LEADERSHIP.  THE GOM ENCOURAGES THE PLO TO </p><p>LIVE UP TO ITS COMMITMENT TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM AND PARTICIPATE </p><p>FULLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>G.  THE GOM HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA ON TERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p>NEITHER HAS THE GOM EVER MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>LIBYA ON TERRORISM ISSUES, BUT THE GOM HAS OFTEN STATED ITS </p><p>BELIEF THAT LIBYA HAS REFORMED ITS WAYS AND ABANDONED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM, AND THAT THE U.S. AND U.K. SHOULD ENTER INTO DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH LIBYA.  MOROCCO ABSTAINED FROM THE UNSC\'S VOTE ON RESOLUTION </p><p>731 ON 31 MARCH 1992 AND APPARENTLY RAISED NO OBJECTIONS TO THE </p><p>MAGHREB ARAB UNION\'S NOVEMBER 11 SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE CONTAINING </p><p>LANGUAGE URGING THE UNSC TO "RECONSIDER" ITS SANCTIONS STANCE </p><p>AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>H.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE GOM SINCE 1991. IT REMAINS OPPOSED TO TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I.  MOROCCO IS LINKED TO LIBYA BY BOTH COUNTRIES\'S MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>THE ARAB MAGHREB UNION, AS WELL AS BY EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL TIES. </p><p> </p><p>PARTLY BECAUSE OF THESE TIES, THE GOM HAS SOUGHT THE LIFTING OF </p><p>SANCTIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FOLLOWING MOST OF THEM.  WE </p><p>RECALL THAT LAST JANUARY, MOROCCO AS A UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBER, VOTED FOR THE SANCTIONS RESOLUTION AGAINST LIBYA.  ALL </p><p>FLIGHTS BETWEEN MOROCCO AND LIBYA CEASED AS OF 15 APRIL.  THE </p><p>LIBYAN AIRLINES OFFICE IN CASABLANCA REMAINS OPEN, BUT DOES NOT </p><p>SELL TICKETS OR BOOK RESERVATIONS TO LIBYA.  THE LIBYAN </p><p>DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE (18 LIBYAN DIPLOMATS AND ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>PERSONNEL) IN RABAT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED.  APPARENTLY </p><p>THE GOM IS CONCERNED THAT AN EFFORT TO FORCE A REDUCTION IN THE </p><p>LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE WOULD RESULT IN LIBYAN RETALIATION, </p><p>WHICH WOULD IN TURN IMPACT ON THE GOM\'S ABILITY TO PROTECT </p><p>MOROCCAN RESIDENTS IN LIBYA.  (COMMENT:  THE GOM CLAIMS THAT </p><p>THERE ARE CA. 100,000 MOROCCANS LIVING IN LIBYA.) </p><p> </p><p>VREELAND. </p><p></p></div>
