THAT NUMBER COULD RISE. </p><p> </p><p>--THIS IS NOW THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACT OF POLITICAL </p><p>REPRESSION IN CUBA IN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>--AMONG THOSE DETAINED INCLUDE MARTHA BEATRIZ ROQUE, RENE </p><p>GOMEZ MANZANO, AND FELIX BONNE. THESE THREE LEADERS OF </p><p>THE CUBAN OPPOSITION WERE CONDUCTING A PEACEFUL FAST </p><p>PROTESTING THE DETENTION OF ANOTHER DISSIDENT (DR. OSCAR </p><p>ELIAS BISCET) WHEN THEIR EVENT WAS BROKEN UP BY STATE </p><p>SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>--AMONG THE DOZENS OF CUBANS ARRESTED INCLUDE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION: </p><p>TODOS UNIDOS LEADERS PEDRO PABLO ALVAREZ RAMOS, OSVALDO </p><p>ALFONSO, FELIX NAVARRO, AND VICTOR ROLANDO ARROYO; </p><p>MEMBERS OF OSWALDO PAYA\'S CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT </p><p>JOSE DANIEL FERRER CASTILLO AND LUIS ENRIQUE FERRER </p><p>CASTILLO; THE LEADER OF THE INDEPENDENT LIBRARY MOVEMENT, </p><p>JISELLE DELGADO; AND, INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS RAUL RIVERO, </p><p>OSCAR ESPINOSA CHEPE, RICARDO GONZALEZ ALFONSO, AND JOSE </p><p>LUIS GARCIA PANEQUE. </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONNECTION MADE </p><p>BY CUBAN STATE MEDIA BETWEEN THESE ARRESTS AND MEETINGS </p><p>HELD BETWEEN MANY OF THOSE ARRESTED AND U.S. DIPLOMATS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS THREATENED TO PROSECUTE THOSE </p><p>ARRESTED UNDER "LAW 88," WHICH CARRIES SENTENCES OF 7 TO </p><p>20 YEARS FOR ANYONE RECEIVING ASSISTANCE FROM THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>--THE ARRESTS INCLUDED EXTENSIVE SEARCHES OF OPPOSITION </p><p>MEMBERS\' HOMES. A WIFE OF ONE LEADER TOLD OUR DIPLOMATS </p><p>THAT STATE SECURITY HAD CARRIED OUT A FIVE-HOUR SEARCH OF </p><p>HER SMALL HOME, DESTROYING BEDDING, REMOVING NEARLY ALL OF </p><p>HER BOOKS AND MAGAZINES, AND EVEN SEARCHING THE STRUCTURE </p><p>OF THE HOUSE. WHILE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH, THEY TURNED </p><p>ON HER TELEVISION AND INSTRUCTED HER TO WATCH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROGRAM DENOUNCING U.S. DIPLOMATS\' TIES TO </p><p>"COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY TRAITORS" WHILE THEY DISASSEMBLED </p><p>HER HOME.

THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE </p><p>THESE STEPS WITH IMPUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>(FOR COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS MEMBERS AND OBSERVERS) </p><p>--THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TOOK THIS ACTION AS THE UN </p><p>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS OPENED IN GENEVA IS ESPECIALLY </p><p>EGREGIOUS. THE COMMISSION MUST RESPOND TO THIS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>(FOR EU MEMBERS) </p><p>--WE HOPE THE EU WILL TAKE THIS ACTION INTO ACCOUNT WHEN </p><p>CONSIDERING CUBA\'S APPLICATION TO JOIN COTONOU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRESS STATEMENT - MARCH 19 </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT BY RICHARD BOUCHER, SPOKESMAN </p><p> </p><p>U.S. OUTRAGED BY CUBAN CRACKDOWN ON DISSIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IS OUTRAGED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ANNOUNCED ARREST OF DOZENS OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS YESTERDAY </p><p>EVENING. THIS IS AN APPALLING ACT OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST </p><p>THOSE WHO SEEK FREEDOM AND DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN CUBA. </p><p>THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SIMPLY SPEAKING OUT, </p><p>ONE OF THE MOST BASIC INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS. WE CALL ON THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THEM </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JOIN US </p><p>IN DEMANDING THEIR RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ARRESTS FOLLOWED A GOVERNMENT RADIO </p><p>BROADCAST ATTACKING THE HEAD OF OUR INTERESTS SECTION AND </p><p>THE OUTREACH EFFORTS OF OUR DIPLOMATS IN CUBA. THE CUBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED THAT MANY OF THE DETAINEES WERE </p><p>ARRESTED FOR MEETING WITH OUR DIPLOMATS. WE ALSO NOTE </p><p>THAT THESE EVENTS COINCIDE WITH THE OPENING OF THE UN </p><p>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENEVA, OF WHICH CUBA IS A </p><p>MEMBER. THE UNITED STATES CALLS ON THE COMMISSION TO </p><p>CONDEMN THIS ACTION IN THE STRONGEST TERMS. CUBA HAS </p><p>AGAIN DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS NOT FIT TO SIT ON THIS </p><p>COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE THESE ARRESTS ARE INTENDED TO DEAL A BLOW AGAINST </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT, THEY WILL NOT QUELL THE CUBAN\'S </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DESIRE FOR FREEDOM AND THEY ONLY SERVE TO EXPOSE </p><p>THE WEAKNESS AND DESPERATION OF THE REGIME AS IT REALIZES </p><p>THAT IT IS NEARING ITS END. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
