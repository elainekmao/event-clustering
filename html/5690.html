(SBU) The Maoist insurgent leadership seems to be </p><p>enforcing so far the moratorium on armed violence among its </p><p>lower-level cadre across the country.  There have been no </p><p>reports of violations of the ceasefire, although extortion of </p><p>funds from major business houses reportedly continues. </p><p>Revised Rules of Engagement have yet to be adopted by either </p><p>side, although Maoist leader Prachanda has called for the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army to return to the barracks.  The Maoists </p><p>appear to be using the respite to rebuild some of the popular </p><p>support squandered during more than a year of violent </p><p>excesses and to mend fences with mainstream political </p><p>parties.  An agenda and schedule for anticipated negotiations </p><p>between the Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists have </p><p>not yet been agreed upon, nor has the GON announced the </p><p>composition of its negotiating team.  By cancelling a planned </p><p>general strike and by naming two members of their top </p><p>leadership as negotiators, the insurgents may be trying, at </p><p>least initially, to win jaded public confidence in the </p><p>sincerity of their negotiating efforts.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CEASEFIRE BRINGS WELCOME RESPITE FROM BLOODSHED, BANDHS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) As of COB on February 12, the ceasefire between the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents announced the </p><p>night of January 29 (Ref A) generally seems to be holding </p><p>well, with only a few violations reported.  The body of a </p><p>policeman who had been abducted two weeks previously was </p><p>found in the far western district of Kanchanpur the morning </p><p>after the ceasefire announcement; it was unclear when he had </p><p>been killed.  Similarly, the body of a young man abducted </p><p>from his home by Maoists in southwestern Dang district before </p><p>the ceasefire was discovered on February 11.  Local media </p><p>reports speculated that he had been killed before the </p><p>ceasefire was announced, but offered no basis for that </p><p>assumption.  On February 3 suspected Maoists abducted </p><p>brothers Juthe and Durga Bahadur Nepali from their home in </p><p>the mid-western district of Surkhet.  The brothers have not </p><p>been seen since, and their whereabouts are unknown.  (Note: </p><p>During the July-November 2001 ceasefire, the Maoists </p><p>kidnapped 23 Nepalis in separate incidents.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  There have been no attacks reported against </p><p>installations of the security forces since the January 29 </p><p>announcement.  Scattered accounts from locations across the </p><p>country have begun to trickle into Kathmandu relating </p><p>homecomings of long-lost Maoist cadre, the return of some </p><p>civil servants to their long-abandoned posts, and apparent </p><p>efforts, at least on the part of some insurgent commanders, </p><p>to mend fences with local residents and mainstream political </p><p>activists alienated by Maoist violence and excesses over the </p><p>past year.  Reported Maoist approaches to encouraging such </p><p>dialogue range from the seemingly democratic and high-minded </p><p>(a roundtable conference in Rolpa to which local </p><p>representatives of all mainstream political parties were </p><p>invited) to the more typically heavy-handed (armed cadre </p><p>forcing villagers to attend lengthy, ideological harangues in </p><p>the north-central districts of Baglung and Myagdi). The </p><p>Maoists and their affiliated student wing cancelled the </p><p>respective national strikes, or "bandhs," they had scheduled </p><p>to take place from February 13, in comemoration of the </p><p>beginning of the insurgency, as a sign of good faith (Refs B </p><p>and C). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WHAT\'S OKAY AND WHAT\'S NOT? </p><p>STILL UNCLEAR </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Although there have been no armed engagements </p><p>between the security forces and the Maoists since January 29, </p><p>the lack of terms of reference or a mutually accepted "code </p><p>of conduct" for the ceasefire makes it difficult to determine </p><p>whether there have been violations.  (Note:  During the 2001 </p><p>ceasefire--which also lacked a "code of conduct"--the GON </p><p>nonetheless catalogued 87 violations by the Maoists in the </p><p>first two months.  End note.)  In the absence of such terms </p><p>of reference or amended rules of engagement, mutual </p><p>accusations of violations are beginning to surface.  The </p><p>security forces continue to conduct armed patrols--and, in </p><p>some cases, to arrest suspected Maoists--prompting a call </p><p>from Maoist leader Prachanda for the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>to "be called back to the barracks and (stop) unnecessary </p><p>raids and spying in plainclothes."  Curfews continue to be </p><p>enforced in some districts.  At the same time, reports of </p><p>armed Maoists cadre holding open public meetings--including </p><p>some with forced local participation--and stories in the </p><p>media of armed Maoists carrying out "guerrilla training" in </p><p>certain districts have elicited calls from various observers </p><p>for the Maoists to disarm before negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Nor have the Maoists suspended their extensive </p><p>(and apparently lucrative) practice of extortion during the </p><p>ceasefire.  The POL/ECON section polled eight of the largest </p><p>Nepali business houses by telephone one week after the </p><p>ceasefire was announced; five of the eight reported having </p><p>received extortion demands since the announcement, and the </p><p>remaining three fully expected to hear from their "contacts" </p><p>in the near future.  Citing the Maoists\' unflagging </p><p>fundraising activities, some of the businessmen expressed </p><p>skepticism that the insurgents are sincere about seeking a </p><p>peaceful resolution to the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  On February 11 the National Human Rights Commission </p><p>(NHRC) proposed a six-point code of conduct to both the GON </p><p>and the Maoists.  Echoing some of the more recent Maoist </p><p>demands (see below), the NHRC document called on the GON to </p><p>repeal the Terrorist and Destructive Activities Act (which </p><p>allows suspects to be held without charge for 60 days) and to </p><p>order the Royal Nepal Army back to barracks.  Under the </p><p>proposed code, the Maoists would refrain from murder, </p><p>abduction, planting explosive devices, and extorting money. </p><p>Neither side has responded to the NHRC proposal. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MAOIST TEAM READY; GON\'S IS NOT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Following quickly upon the ceasefire announcement, </p><p>the Maoists promptly named the members of their team for </p><p>prospective negotiations, which included two of the </p><p>seniormost insurgent leadership (Ref A).  (Note:  A GON </p><p>participant in the unsuccessful negotiations in 2001 noted </p><p>that the Maoist representatives seemed to lack </p><p>decision-making authority.  The progress of negotiations was </p><p>thus continuously impeded by the Maoists having to "check </p><p>back in" with their senior leadership.  End note.)  The GON, </p><p>in contrast, after initially naming Narayan Singh Pun, </p><p>Minister of Physical Planning and Works, as lead </p><p>"coordinator" for talks, has not moved as swiftly to announce </p><p>the remaining members of its roster.  For now, Pun continues </p><p>to occupy the local news spotlight alone, reportedly </p><p>shuttling back and forth to hammer out ground rules for </p><p>negotiations with Maoist leaders, visiting mid-ranking Maoist </p><p>suspects detained in Kathmandu jails, but remaining </p><p>relatively closed-mouthed--especially in comparison to </p><p>previous GON negotiators--about the substance of these </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  No date, venue or agenda has yet been announced for </p><p>talks.  While the GON has not publicly announced any </p><p>pre-conditions for negotiations, the Maoists are busily </p><p>adding to their ever-expanding list. In a February 7 </p><p>interview with a centrist Nepali-language newspaper, Maoist </p><p>leader Prachanda, besides demanding the RNA return to </p><p>barracks, called for the GON to publish a list of detainees </p><p>"and start releasing them."  A group of Maoist detainees in </p><p>Kathmandu, meanwhile, is clamoring for the release of all </p><p>Maoist suspects (not surprisingly); the abrogation of special </p><p>anti-terrorism laws; and more equitable coverage in the </p><p>state-owned media.  The GON has not formally responded to </p><p>these demands. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  What the Maoists hope to achieve through </p><p>negotiations; whether they are seriously re-engaging with </p><p>political parties; whether they believe they can use dialogue </p><p>tactically to isolate and discredit the Palace; whether </p><p>negotiations will take place at all--such questions remain </p><p>unclear.  Despite the numerous uncertainties that continue to </p><p>surround efforts toward negotiations, the question of whether </p><p>the military wing of the Maoists, represented by several </p><p>thousand gun-toting youths across the country, would accept a </p><p>truce imposed by its political wing appears to have been </p><p>answered for now.  The fact that the far-flung Maoist cadre </p><p>are observing the ceasefire with uncharacteristic discipline </p><p>and restraint attests to the importance that their leadership </p><p>is attaching to creating, at the very minimum, the appearance </p><p>of "conducive conditions" for talks.  The nomination of </p><p>political ideologue Baburam Bhattarai and top military </p><p>tactician Ram Bahadur Thapa to the negotiating team also </p><p>seems calculated to dispel earlier rumors of a rift between </p><p>the military and ideological wings of the insurgency, and </p><p>offers some hope that the Maoists, should negotiations ensue, </p><p>will be able to speak with a single, authoritative voice. </p><p>But while the Maoists may be serious about creating </p><p>"conducive conditions" for negotiations--perhaps in order to </p><p>raise public hopes for success and thereby increase the </p><p>pressure on the GON to ensure such success--we continue to be </p><p>skeptical that they are equally serious about actually </p><p>reaching a negotiated settlement that stops anywhere short of </p><p>the one-party, autocratic state espoused in their rhetoric. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
