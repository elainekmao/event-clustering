<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  INEC - LESSONS IN FUZZY MATH </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  We have reported extensively on the troubles </p><p>that have hampered the Independent National Election </p><p>Commission\'s conduct of voter registration for the April </p><p>elections.  One of the major factors contributing to the </p><p>public consternation has been INEC\'s frequently </p><p>inconsistent statements and recalculations of the key </p><p>numbers in the registration exercise.  INEC has given </p><p>different figures on the total number of registrations, the </p><p>number of eligible voters (approved registrants) and the </p><p>number of fraudulent applications.  This imprecision has </p><p>lead INEC critics to complain that INEC is either </p><p>incompetent or insincere.  There have been charges that </p><p>INEC manipulated the voter\'s registration figures so that </p><p>it could manipulate the actual voter count to favor the </p><p>PDP.  While these accusations remain unproven, the best way </p><p>for INEC to avoid the cloud of suspicion is to ensure that </p><p>the vote tabulation is transparent and to make sure its </p><p>figures are accurate before it releases any electoral </p><p>results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  In September 2002, INEC Chairman Adel Guobadia </p><p>announced that 72 million registration forms had been </p><p>distributed throughout the country.  At the end of the </p><p>process, he alleged that problems with availability of the </p><p>forms were because millions of forms had been stolen by </p><p>political agents and corrupt INEC officials at the local </p><p>level.  (72-10=62)  According to his after-action report on </p><p>the registration process, 4 million forms had been spoiled </p><p>during the exercise.  (62-4=58)  INEC later announced that </p><p>another 10 million had been identified as multiple </p><p>registrants and deleted from the list.  (58-10=48)  The </p><p>supplemental registration exercise in January 2003 </p><p>registered less than 2 million additional voters. </p><p>(48+2=50)  Using these figures, we should expect 50 million </p><p>registered voters.  (COMMENT:  The furor caused by the </p><p>unavailability of forms last September may have prompted </p><p>Guobadia to issue defensive, inaccurate statements that he </p><p>probably regrets now.  His explanation that 10 million </p><p>forms were stolen is probably one such statement he wishes </p><p>he could retract.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  However, in another September 2002 public </p><p>statement at the end of the registration period, INEC </p><p>announced there were "about 69 million" registered voters. </p><p>By late January 2003, Guobadia cited about 67 million. </p><p>(Two million missing.)  In March, his figure for total </p><p>voters, after deducting underage and multiple </p><p>registrations, fell to 64 million.  The numbers published </p><p>this week show 60.8 million with 7 million registrants </p><p>disqualified.  The range of disqualifications varied by </p><p>state from a low of two percent in Plateau to a high of 37 </p><p>percent in Bayelsa.  Seven (or eight, depending on the </p><p>math) million temporary receipts are potentially still in </p><p>circulation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  There were 58 million eligible voters in the 1999 </p><p>elections.  In 2002, the northwest and northeast produced </p><p>ten percent more voters, while the southwest number held </p><p>steady.  The southern minority areas (south-south) </p><p>registered a six percent growth, the north-central grew by </p><p>about 3.5 percent, and the southeast shrank by about six </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COROLLARIES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The final tally of registered voters meshes with </p><p>INEC\'s initial estimate made in 2002 that each polling site </p><p>would be supplied with 500 ballots.  With about 122,000 </p><p>polling sites nationwide, a maximum of 61 million ballots </p><p>will be needed, close to the 60.8 million official figure </p><p>released early this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Unresolved issues surrounding INEC include claims </p><p>from the September exercise that many eligible citizens </p><p>were unable to register due to a lack of materials. </p><p>Reports of manipulation of the lists by national and local </p><p>officials are abundant but unsubstantiated.  Usually, the </p><p>opposition claims that the incumbent has eliminated </p><p>qualified voters from the register along ethnic lines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>FUZZY LOGIC </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  The imprecision, lack of transparency </p><p>and inconsistent statements made by INEC over the course of </p><p>its effort to register Nigerian voters leave an unfortunate </p><p>hole in its credibility.  Many candidates who lose will </p><p>likely point to INEC\'s mistakes as what cost them the </p><p>election and then head straight to court to challenge the </p><p>results.  A solid performance on election days will be </p><p>necessary to dispel the public\'s doubts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
