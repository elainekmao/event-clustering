Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Harrison, </p><p>Ambassador Pearson, Senior Coordinator of the Office </p><p>of International Women\'s Issues April Palmerlee, and </p><p>the Consul General participated with university vice </p><p>rector Sevket Pamuk in ceremonies opening the </p><p>conference.  During the course of the conference </p><p>Assistant Secretary Harrison met with several </p><p>leading Turkish businesswomen, resulting in plans </p><p>for the establishment of a chapter in Turkey of the </p><p>International Women\'s Forum, as well as with a group </p><p>of American Fulbright students who related their </p><p>experiences in Turkey and who were invited by the </p><p>Assistant Secretary to write recommendations for the </p><p>program.  The keynote address, "Historical </p><p>Perspective: The Turkish Example," was delivered by </p><p>Professor Akile Gursoy, prominent sociologist and </p><p>granddaughter of Turkey\'s third president, Celal </p><p>Bayar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The conference attracted more than 110 overseas </p><p>participants from the Middle East, South Asia, North </p><p>Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, including </p><p>scholars from Afghanistan, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, </p><p>India, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Nepal, Palestine, </p><p>Tunisia, Europe and the United States.  More than </p><p>150 Turkish women NGO leaders, academics and </p><p>business persons, as well as former Fulbright and </p><p>Humphrey grantees, constituted the main conference </p><p>audience.  Sessions were varied in style and </p><p>presentation, and debate throughout was lively. The </p><p>most heavily-attended panels were on "The Role of </p><p>Women in Rebuilding Afghanistan," "Women in Turkey," </p><p>and "Civil Society: War and Peace."  The conference </p><p>program included evening screenings of award-winning </p><p>films produced/directed by women filmmakers at the </p><p>Mithat Elam Film Center on campus and an exhibit of </p><p>books by women writers (to be donated to the host </p><p>institution). Turkish print and electronic media </p><p>covered the opening ceremonies and concluding </p><p>banquet.  In addition, the Library of Congress film </p><p>team recorded the entire conference for display on </p><p>its website. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  During the final banquet of the conference a </p><p>Fulbright scholarship provided by the Bureau of </p><p>Educational and Cultural Affairs for $50,000 was </p><p>announced in honor of the late Inci Pirinccioglu, </p><p>one of the first Turkish Fulbright students, who </p><p>returned to Turkey from study at Columbia University </p><p>during the 1950s to build a successful travel and </p><p>events planning business.  The Pirinccioglu family </p><p>was present at the occasion, spoke of the effect of </p><p>the Fulbright program on their mother\'s life, and </p><p>announced their intention to establish a reciprocal </p><p>Fulbright award which would support an American </p><p>student studying in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  In conjunction with the conference, Assistant </p><p>Secretary Harrison announced a $250,000 award under </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ECA\'s Partnerships for Learning Initiative to the </p><p>U.S.-Turkish Binational Commission to enable Turkish </p><p>undergraduate students with demonstrated financial </p><p>need to study in the United States at several </p><p>campuses of the State University of New York (SUNY) </p><p>system.  The announcement was made at a press </p><p>conference in the consulate general garden following </p><p>a meeting with the rectors of ten Turkish </p><p>universities, including five universities from the </p><p>southeast of the country.  It is anticipated that </p><p>other donors, including the American university </p><p>sector, will provide additional funding for this </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Mass circulation Turkish dailies Hurriyet and </p><p>Milliyet carried prominent coverage with photographs </p><p>both of the $50 thousand Inci Pirinccioglu </p><p>Scholarship award and of the $250 thousand </p><p>Partnership for Learning Initiative scholarship </p><p>announcement.  Clips of the press conference in the </p><p>consulate garden were aired on NTV and other </p><p>stations.  In addition, a long interview with </p><p>Assistant Secretary Harrison conducted by senior </p><p>columnist Ferai Tinc (cited two years ago by a UK </p><p>paper as one of the most respected women journalists </p><p>in the world) was featured in the Sunday, September </p><p>22, edition of Hurriyet daily.  Lively TV interviews </p><p>with conference participants, especially with the </p><p>Afghan women, were among the event highlights picked </p><p>up by the Turkish media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  The staff of PA--Istanbul wish to express their </p><p>collective thanks and appreciation to numerous </p><p>individuals in ECA and to their colleagues at the US </p><p>Mission and the Fulbright Commission in Turkey for </p><p>the impressive cooperation and teamwork which made </p><p>this program possible. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
