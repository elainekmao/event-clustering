<p>S E C R E T CAIRO 006321 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/04/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: SHARING THE CASE AGAINST AL-QA\'IDA WITH EGYPT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 170698 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RENO HARNISH. REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MAKING THE CASE TO THE GOE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) ON OCTOBER 3 AND 4, DRAWING ON DOCUMENTS PROVIDED </p><p>REFTEL, MISSION STAFF MET WITH EGYPTIAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, </p><p>SECURITY, INTELLIGENCE, AND MILITARY OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE </p><p>CASE AGAINST AL-QAIDA.  IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRIEFINGS, WE </p><p>HAD DISTILLED INFORMATION IN REFTEL INTO FOUR BASIC SECTIONS: </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA\'S INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ATTACKS, TACTICAL </p><p>SIMILARITY TO EARLIER ATTACKS, LINKS BETWEEN THE TALEBAN AND </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA, AND U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH THE TALEBAN AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) DATT, OMC, ROAL CHIEFS BRIEFED DMI HEAD MG TOHAMY WHO </p><p>REACTED VERY POSITIVELY, ASSERTING THAT HE "UNDERSTOOD </p><p>EXACTLY" WHAT THE INTENT OF THE REPORT HAD BEEN, WISHED THAT </p><p>OTHERS IN THE U.S. HAD "LISTENED TO WHAT WE HAD TO SAY" PRIOR </p><p>TO THE ATTACKS, AND PROMISED TO INSURE THAT MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE TANTAWY WAS FULL AWARE OF THE TEXT PRIOR TO </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH SECDEF RUMSFELD. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MAINTAIN CLOSE TOUCH </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) DCM DISCUSSED THE REPORT WITH PRESIDENCY OFFICIAL </p><p>MAGID ABDEL FATTAH ABDEL AZIZ.  HE WELCOMED THE BRIEFING, </p><p>TOOK EXTENSIVE NOTES, AND PROMPTLY BRIEFED PRESIDENT MUBARAK. </p><p> NEITHER OFFERED SUBSTANTIVE OBJECTIONS TO THE MATERIAL AND </p><p>TOOK IT AT FACE VALUE.  ABDEL AZIZ DID NOTE THAT, WHILE </p><p>LIMITED DEMONSTRATIONS ACROSS CAMPUSES IN EGYPT HAVE BEEN </p><p>PROMPTED BY EVENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, WHEN THE U.S. </p><p>REACTION OCCURRED, THERE WOULD BE SOME FACTIONS WHICH WOULD </p><p>TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO EXPAND THEM.  THE GOE, HE SAID, </p><p>WOULD LIKE AN HOUR OR TWO NOTICE BEFORE THE STRIKE AS IT </p><p>WOULD THEN TAKE EXTRA INTERNAL SECURITY PRECAUTIONS. ABDEL </p><p>AZIZ SAID THAT PRESIDENT MUBARAK MIGHT RAISE THIS WITH </p><p>VISITING SECDEF OCTOBER 4.  HE URGED THAT THE U.S. MAINTAIN </p><p>CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE GOE ON THE SCOPE OF THE MILITARY </p><p>REACTION SO AS TO PRECLUDE HEZBALLAH/SYRIA FROM STOKING AND </p><p>DISSEMINATING CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS TO WHERE THE U.S. WAS </p><p>HEADING.  IN ADDITION, HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT MUBARAK WAS </p><p>UNDER THE CLEAR IMPRESSION THAT THE U.S. HAD GIVEN ORAL </p><p>ASSURANCES TO OMAR SOLEIMAN THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT HIT </p><p>SYRIA, LIBYA, OR LEBANON.  CONCLUDING, FATTAH REITERATED </p><p>MUBARAK\'S VIEW THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH WOULD NOT BRING </p><p>ANYTHING USEFUL TO THE PROCESS AND THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>STATEMENT ON PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD HAD BEEN GREATLY </p><p>APPRECIATED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IT WON\'T HAPPEN HERE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) THE AMBASSADOR MET OCTOBER 4 WITH SALAH SALAMA, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF STATE SECURITY INVESTIGATION SECTOR (INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY).  SALAMA PREDICTED THERE WOULD BE DEMONSTRATIONS IN </p><p>THE EVENT OF A STRIKE ON AFGHANISTAN, BUT MAINTAINED THAT THE </p><p>GREATER POTENTIAL FOR SUCH ACTIONS WOULD RESULT FROM </p><p>CONTINUING VIOLENCE UNDERTAKEN BY ISRAELIS AGAINST </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  HE ASSERTED THAT THERE WAS ALSO POLITICAL </p><p>AGITATION IN UNIONS AND SYNDICATES BUT THIS TOO RESULTED FROM </p><p>ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE. SALAMA PRAISED THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS (SHOWED GREAT "SERIOUSNESS") ON RESOLVING THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) CONTINUING, SALAMA DISMISSED THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTION BY BIN LADIN IN EGYPT.  HE DID </p><p>ALLOW,HOWEVER, THAT A "CRAZED INDIVIDUAL" OR PEOPLE COMING </p><p>FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH FORGED DOCUMENTS MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO </p><p>SOMETHING. SALAMA\'S CONFIDENCE SPRANG FROM THE JULY ROUND-UP </p><p>OF A GROUP OF EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (EIJ) MEMBERS BY THE </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES.  THE EIJ HAD BEEN ATTEMPTING TO RECRUIT </p><p>NEW MEMBERS FROM THE RANKS OF THE WEALTHY IN EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) TO COMPLETE OUR BRIEFINGS, ECONOMIC/POLITICAL </p><p>MINISTER- COUNSELOR PROVIDED THE CASE TO MOHAMMED FARNAWANY </p><p>OF THE FM\'S CABINET AND ROAL BRIEFED EGIS DIRECTOR OMAR </p><p>SOLEIMAN, WHO DISMISSING THE NEED TO HEAR THE EVIDENCE, WAS </p><p>MORE CONCERNED WITH A DISCUSSION ON NEXT STEPS AND ASSURANCES </p><p>HIS SERVICE WAS PREPARED TO COOPERATE FULLY.. </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
