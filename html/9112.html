<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 002996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  VATICAN SPOTLIGHT ON ROMA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY:  THE VATICAN\'S FIFTH WORLD CONGRESS OF THE </p><p>PASTORAL CARE OF GYPSIES WILL TAKE PLACE IN BUDAPEST, </p><p>HUNGARY FROM JUNE 30 TO JULY 6.  THE CONGRESS WILL FOCUS ON </p><p> </p><p>THE PASTORAL NEEDS OF THE ROMA, BUT WILL ALSO INCLUDE </p><p>LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS ON EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, INTEGRATION, </p><p>AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN THE FORMATION OF A CULTURE OF </p><p>    SOLIDARITY AND TOLERANCE.  NATIONAL CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>DIRECTORS FOR ROMA ISSUES WILL ALSO PREPARE A DOCUMENT AT </p><p>THE CONGRESS ADDRESSING GLOBAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE CARE </p><p>OF ROMA.  THE CONGRESS IS BEING HELD OUTSIDE OF THE VATICAN </p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A SHOW OF RECOGNITION FOR THE EFFORTS </p><p>OF THE HUNGARIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE AND HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION OF ROMA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL </p><p>CARE OF MIGRANTS AND ITINERANT PEOPLES, ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO </p><p>MARCHETTO TOLD POLOFF AND POL ASSISTANT JUNE 26 THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S FIFTH WORLD CONGRESS OF THE PASTORAL CARE OF </p><p>GYPSIES WILL BRING TOGETHER 150 REPRESENTATIVES FROM 25 </p><p>EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES WORLDWIDE.  MOST PARTICIPANTS, WHO </p><p>WILL FOCUS ON THE PASTORAL CARE OF GYPSIES, REPRESENT </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT THE U.S., INDIA, MEXICO, AND BRAZIL </p><p>-- ALL OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT ROMA POPULATIONS -- WILL </p><p>ALSO BE REPRESENTED.  PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE NATIONAL </p><p>DIRECTORS FOR ROMA ISSUES, PRIESTS, MEN AND WOMEN RELIGIOUS, </p><p>LAY PASTORAL AGENTS, AND ROMA.  AMONG THE ROMA, THERE ARE 15 </p><p>CATHOLIC PRIESTS, NUNS, AND STUDENTS, WHO WILL PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN AN EDUCATION ROUND TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHILE THE CONGRESS WILL REVIEW BROADER ISSUES RELATING </p><p>TO INTEGRATION OF ROMA, MARCHETTO NOTED THAT THESE ISSUES </p><p>WOULD BE EXAMINED PRIMARILY IN THE CONTEXT OF PASTORAL CARE </p><p>FOR THE ROMA.  NEVERTHELESS, MARCHETTO EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE DIGNITY OF </p><p>THE ROMA AND THEIR TREATMENT IN SOCIETY.  HE POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE VATICAN FREQUENTLY ADVOCATES ON THEIR BEHALF TO </p><p>LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.  IN THIS REGARD, HE ALSO </p><p>    OBSERVED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S INTEREST ENGAGED A NUMBER OF </p><p>VATICAN COUNCILS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL `COR </p><p>UNUM\' WHICH COORDINATES VATICAN HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS </p><p>WORLDWIDE HELPS PROVIDE FOR ROMA MATERIAL NEEDS, WHILE THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE EXAMINES GOVERNMENT </p><p>POLICIES AFFECTING ROMA.  MARCHETTO ELABORATED  THAT HIS OWN </p><p>COUNCIL FOR MIGRANTS HAD FOUR OFFICES DEALING WITH THE </p><p>PASTORAL NEEDS OF REFUGEES, MIGRANTS, AND OTHER NOMADS (I.E. </p><p>CIRCUS WORKERS, PILGRIMS, FISHERMEN), AND `PEOPLE OF THE </p><p>ROAD, INCLUDING RAILWAY AND AIRPORT WORKERS, SEAFARERS, </p><p>FOREIGN STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A DISCUSSION OF USG EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ROMA ISSUES, </p><p>MARCHETTO MADE A POINT TO URGE THE USG NOT TO GIVE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS SHORT-SHRIFT IN OUR FOCUS ON THE WAR ON TERRORISM. </p><p>WHILE UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR NEW SECURITY POLICIES, </p><p>MARCHETTO SAID HE HOPES THE PENDULUM WILL SWING BACK AND THE </p><p>U.S. WILL RETURN TO ITS HISTORIC "DESTINY" OF OFFERING </p><p>OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM TO THE WORLD\'S REFUGEES, MIGRANT </p><p>WORKERS AND FOREIGN STUDENTS.  HE URGED THE USG TO CONSIDER </p><p>SIGNING THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE PROTECTION OF </p><p>THE RIGHTS OF ALL MIGRANT WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES.  HE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT ONLY 21 </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED ON AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS AND NO </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IS YET A SIGNATORY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE CONGRESS\'S PRIMARY FOCUS ON </p><p>PASTORAL ISSUES, WE EXPECT THE CONGRESS TO DEVOTE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES SUCH AS EDUCATION, </p><p>INTEGRATION, AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN SHAPING </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF ROMA.  BEYOND THE VATICAN, MANY CATHOLIC- </p><p>    AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE LAY CATHOLIC SANT\' </p><p>EGIDIO COMMUNITY REMAIN ACTIVE IN ASSISTING THE ROMA </p><p>COMMUNITIES IN ITALY AND ELSEWHERE.  OFTEN, HOWEVER, LOCAL </p><p>PARISHES TAKE LITTLE INTEREST IN ROMA ISSUES AND CAN </p><p>SOMETIMES BE HOSTILE.  OUR SANT\' EGIDIO CONTACTS RECENTLY </p><p>TOOK US TO COFFEE HOSTED BY A ROMA FAMILY FROM BOSNIA. </p><p>BETWEEN GUSTS OF WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LARGE HOLES IN THE </p><p>WALLS OF THEIR SHACK THE FAMILY EXPLAINED THAT THEY RECEIVED </p><p>LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR LOCAL CHURCH OR THE ITALIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  OUR SANT\' EGIDIO HOSTS EXPLAINED THAT THE LOCAL </p><p>PARISH PRIEST HAD LOBBIED THE GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE THE ROMA </p><p>ENCAMPMENT.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>SHARE INFORMATION EMERGING FROM THE CONGRESS WIDELY WITHIN </p><p>BISHOP\'S CONFERENCES, ND TO KEEP ROMA ISSUES AT THE </p><p>FOREFRONT OF THE VTICAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA02996 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
