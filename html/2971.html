<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002478 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON FOR MAY 20 MEETING </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON/LOWERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN AND DEBT ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2475 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  We understand there will be a high-level interagency </p><p>meeting May 20 to discuss Jordan\'s request for debt relief </p><p>from the Paris Club in the wake of King Abdullah\'s visit to </p><p>Washington and meetings with the President, Secretary </p><p>O\'Neill, NSA Rice and other senior U.S. officials.  Since </p><p>there seemed to be some question about where some of our </p><p>partners in the Paris Club stood on this question, we thought </p><p>it could be useful to offer the following information. </p><p>(Reftel provides additional information on the views of IMF </p><p>staff currently in Amman.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) After returning to Amman, Ambasssdor Gnehm reviewed </p><p>with the French Ambassador and British Charge where their </p><p>governments stand at this point on Jordan\'s request.  The </p><p>British Charge said that Prime Minister Blair had written a </p><p>letter to King Abdullah in March that said HMG "fully </p><p>supports another IMF program and new World Bank lending, and </p><p>will press for the most generous possible debt rescheduling </p><p>for Jordan when it attends the Paris Club later this year." </p><p>That letter, according to the Charge, was cleared by the </p><p>Finance Ministry and represents his government\'s policy on </p><p>this matter.  (Following their meeting, the British Charge </p><p>called the Ambassador to say that Secretary of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Straw is likely to be sending out a letter -- </p><p>one very similar to the Secretary Powell\'s letter late last </p><p>year -- encouraging his counterparts to be supportive of the </p><p>Jordanians along the lines of the PM\'s letter.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The French Ambassador recalled that he had told the </p><p>Ambassador before he left for Washington that the French </p><p>Government had also decided "in response to U.S. prodding" to </p><p>be forthcoming in responding to Jordanian requests.  That </p><p>decision in Paris had included his Finance Ministry\'s </p><p>approval.  He had been instructed to inform the Japanese </p><p>Ambassador in Amman of the agreed French position so as to </p><p>influence Tokyo to join this "forthcoming" approach.  He had </p><p>done so.  Both the French Ambassador and British charge </p><p>emphasized taht Paris and London developed their positions </p><p>based on an understanding that Washington wanted to help </p><p>Jordan. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
