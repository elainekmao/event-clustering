<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  REFORM AND BANKING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 22328 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Concerns on Reform </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On January 27, we delivered reftel message to </p><p>Treasury Undersecretary Oztrak, underlining that Washington </p><p>believed the GOT was now seriously off-track on its IMF </p><p>program and that U.S. assistance in the event of an Iraq </p><p>operation would be impossible without the GOT\'s first </p><p>completing the IMF program\'s Fourth Review.   Oztrak said he </p><p>would relay our concerns to State Minister Babacan, and also </p><p>replied: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The government has a communication problem with the IMF, </p><p>as Fund staff\'s briefings to the USG and others reflect </p><p>graver concerns that those perceived by GOT officials in </p><p>their meetings with the Fund.  The   government has announced </p><p>some economic policy measures (pension increases, tax truce </p><p>law) without prior consultations with the IMF, resulting in a </p><p>loss of confidence by Fund staff in the GOT.  Oztrak believes </p><p>this problem is being solved, with PM Gul committed to full </p><p>consultations, though he is not sure this commitment is </p><p>shared by others in the GOT.  (Comment: This lack of </p><p>consultations with the IMF was evident in today\'s BRSA </p><p>announcement on the two banks, see below.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Oztrak claimed that the draft LOI at least addressed all </p><p>the policy goals desired by the IMF, though he agreed that </p><p>measures to reach the goals were sometimes lacking.  He </p><p>believes the draft LOI, together with "some early action on </p><p>outstanding structural measures," provide a basis for a full </p><p>IMF staff mission, and noted that an IMF fiscal team is </p><p>currently in Ankara to work on the 2003 budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Oztrak agreed that the Fund\'s concerns are based in large </p><p>measure on the lack of clear direction and policy </p><p>implementation by the GOT.  He agreed on the urgency.  "We </p><p>need a credible budget and immediate action on structural </p><p>reforms to contain the negative market impact of an Iraq </p><p>war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment:  Oztrak will relay the message to Babacan, </p><p>and the Ambassador will meet with Deputy PM Sener January 28, </p><p>just before the Higher Planning Council meeting.  Ambassador </p><p>will follow up with State Minister Babacan January 30.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Resolution Plan for Two Banks Announced </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Also on January 27, the Banking Regulatory and </p><p>Supervision Agency (BRSA) announced some of the elements of a </p><p>"protocol" it reached with the Cukurova Group on the shares </p><p>of two banks (Pamuk and Yapi Kredi) previously owned by the </p><p>Cukurova Group.   IMF resident banking expert Carlos Pineura </p><p>told us January 27 that he was upset that the BRSA announced </p><p>this deal without any prior consultations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BRSA Deputy Chairman Ibrahim Canakci explained the </p><p>outlines of the deal as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Cukurova Group drops its law suit challenging BRSA\'s </p><p>take-over of Pamukbank, leaving Pamuk under the BRSA\'s </p><p>Savings Deposit Fund.  In return, BRSA agrees to restructure </p><p>Cukurova\'s $2.7 billion debt to Pamuk on favorable terms:  15 </p><p>year repayment period with a three-year grace period on </p><p>principal payments; interest at LIBOR plus 0.5 percent; </p><p>interest payments every six months.  (Note: similar terms are </p><p>being offered Cukurova for its $200 million debt to other </p><p>BRSA-controlled banks.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Cukurova undertakes to sell 35 percent of its total 45 </p><p>percent share of Yapi Kredi Bank to a strategic investor in </p><p>the next three years.  In the meantime, Cukurova retains its </p><p>economic ownership rights in Yapi Kredi (though BRSA </p><p>maintains the management rights of the 45 percent share). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  BRSA agrees to restructure Cukurova\'s $2.3 billion loan </p><p>to Yapi Kredi on the following terms:  $300 million in </p><p>exchange for Cukurova\'s 50 percent interest in ATEL (a </p><p>prepaid cellphone card business); $2 billion to be repaid </p><p>over 9 years, with three year grace period on principal </p><p>payments; interest at LIBOR plus 3.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Asked about collateral for these restructurings, BRSA\'s </p><p>Canakci also said Cukurova would pledge its shares of </p><p>Turkcell, the cellphone operator. </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  We leave it to banking experts to assess </p><p>the fairness of this deal, but we do note that Cukurova gets </p><p>to keep its Yapi Kredi shares for three years without </p><p>injecting any new capital into the bank (unless Yapi Kredi </p><p>can quickly sell the ATEL shares supposedly worth $300 </p><p>million.)  This doesn\'t appear to us to solve the key problem </p><p>of Yapi Kredi\'s capital weakness (except on paper, which will </p><p>no longer show the Cukurova receivable as "non-paying.") </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
