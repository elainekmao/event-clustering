<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 004807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/T ZWEIBEN AND BOOTH, NEA/RA LAWSON, STAS </p><p>NEUREITER </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP MARBURGER AND OLSEN </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO OBSERVER AGGELER </p><p>VIENNA FOR GOLDMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPL, TPHY, TBIO, KSCA, EAID, SENV, JO, MEPN </p><p>SUBJECT:  SESAME-SOWING THE SEEDS OF REGIONAL SCIENTIFIC </p><p>COOPERATION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Second SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for </p><p>Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) </p><p>Council meeting, hosted in Istanbul in mid-July, yielded a </p><p>productive discussion among the regional members on key </p><p>issues such as upgrading of the synchrotron machine, future </p><p>scientific programs, training, and finance/administration. </p><p>Both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates officially joined </p><p>SESAME since the last meeting in January, increasing </p><p>membership to nine but doing little to raise more funds-a </p><p>recurring and troublesome stumbling block to SESAME\'s future </p><p>development.  Discussion of Libya\'s request for observer </p><p>status was postponed to accommodate the U.S., though not </p><p>publicly stated thus.  Israeli participation in SESAME, </p><p>while generally accepted, still acts as a lightning rod for </p><p>heated discussion.  EU funding still has not been secured, </p><p>but SESAME leadership remains hopeful that $10-15 million </p><p>may be forthcoming.  SESAME and UNESCO are entertaining the </p><p>idea of a Washington roadshow/doorknock to "market" the </p><p>project and drum up U.S. financial support.  Finally, on a </p><p>separate but related matter, UNESCO Director Nalecz confided </p><p>to us that UNESCO had been blindsided by the return of the </p><p>U.S. to the organization and had mishandled the consultation </p><p>process with Washington about future U.S. contributions to </p><p>UNESCO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>A NEW MIDDLE EAST RIPE FOR SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) July witnessed the Second SESAME Council meeting, </p><p>an event that was arguably more productive than previous </p><p>gatherings because of the concrete status reports and plans </p><p>of action delivered by committee chairmen on the project\'s </p><p>scientific, technical, financial, administrative, and </p><p>training components.  SESAME Chairman, Herwig Schopper, </p><p>delivered an upbeat opening statement, welcoming new members </p><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates and charging the </p><p>member countries to make SESAME a reality and "not just a </p><p>virtual laboratory."  "The new political situation in the </p><p>Middle East region offers SESAME new opportunities to </p><p>promote science and encourage regional cooperation," he </p><p>announced.  On the margins, there was talk of inviting the </p><p>Iraqis to join, once a government was in place. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>EXPANDING THE CIRCLE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The U.S. received a special acknowledgement for </p><p>moving quickly to become SESAME\'s first official observer. </p><p>SESAME is awaiting official membership decisions from </p><p>Morocco and Greece, both formerly on the Interim Council, </p><p>and will approach Muscat about Omani membership.  The </p><p>current official members are Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, </p><p>Jordan, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Turkey, and the </p><p>United Arab Emirates. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Schopper described Libya\'s request to become an </p><p>observer of SESAME as a "delicate point" for some countries </p><p>and moved to postpone any discussion until all had a chance </p><p>to consult with their respective governments.  On the </p><p>margins of the meeting, Schopper confided to NEA Regional </p><p>Environment Officer that he had deferred any decision on </p><p>Libya as a gesture to Washington, but asked that the State </p><p>Department determine its position on this by the next </p><p>council meeting in December.  The Israeli delegation told us </p><p>separately that their government had no objections to Libya </p><p>becoming a SESAME observer. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>BRICKS AND MORTAR . . . . . AND MONEY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Thanking the Jordanian government for completing </p><p>the contracting on the construction of the facility, </p><p>Schopper shared his hope that a tangible symbol of the </p><p>project would help to propel SESAME forward.  Nevertheless, </p><p>he underscored the need to make the project operational by </p><p>securing funding for the upgrade of the synchrotron light </p><p>machine and the beamlines, as well as recruiting and </p><p>training staff.  Schopper appealed to the member states to </p><p>convince their governments, politicians, and publics that </p><p>SESAME is a project worthy of support.  "I don\'t think that </p><p>an annual $50,000 contribution will suffice-each member </p><p>state should expect an increase in annual contributions," </p><p>Schopper warned at the outset, underscoring SESAME\'s </p><p>greatest challenge. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The EU remains uncommitted to funding SESAME and </p><p>the EU 2004 budget reportedly has already been allocated </p><p>elsewhere, but Schopper remains hopeful.  Because the SESAME </p><p>facility is physically located in Jordan, it was decided </p><p>that Amman should raise the issue of EU funding in its </p><p>bilateral consultations with Brussels.  Jordanian Education </p><p>Minister Toukan confirmed that his government is already in </p><p>close contact with the EU about SESAME.  While "things are </p><p>looking positive, no decisions have been made" and Jordan </p><p>will continue its lobbying efforts, Toukan added. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Herman Winick of Stanford University remarked that </p><p>a positive EU evaluation might influence any future U.S. </p><p>decision to support SESAME.  Winick added that he continues </p><p>to work on the export licensing requirements and </p><p>transportation options with DOE and DOC for the excess </p><p>dismantled equipment from his lab.  He reported for the </p><p>first time that other U.S. labs and facilities would have </p><p>the first right of refusal to Stanford\'s decommissioned </p><p>light machine.  Schopper reported that the technical </p><p>committee had redesigned the machine to upgrade the power </p><p>from 2GeV to 2.5GeV, as recommended by an EU evaluation </p><p>team-a move designed to curry favor with Brussels. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The beamlines committee report concluded that, in </p><p>addition to the approximately $12-15 million needed for </p><p>upgrading the machine, beamlines were also likely to </p><p>increase the development costs of SESAME.  The chairman </p><p>estimated that three beamlines would require about $16.5 </p><p>million, while five beamlines would require upwards of $20 </p><p>million.  The French observer reiterated his offer from </p><p>January that beamlines may be available from a light source </p><p>being dismantled in France in the December 2003 timeframe. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>CART BEFORE THE HORSE? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) On a positive (but possibly premature) note, the </p><p>scientific committee reported that it had already received </p><p>about 50 excellent scientific proposals requiring use of the </p><p>SESAME machine.  These were in myriad scientific, medical, </p><p>environmental, and archaeological fields.  According to the </p><p>chairwoman, it was a "promising start for the users </p><p>community." </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) On training and capacity building, the respective </p><p>committee raised the recurring problem of training regional </p><p>scientists who later migrate to other institutions because </p><p>SESAME is not yet up and running.  Schopper encouraged </p><p>member states to become more aggressive in pursuing training </p><p>opportunities.  For example, money provided by IAEA for </p><p>training remains unused and a Brazilian offer to train three </p><p>scientists has only elicited a sole nominee from Jordan to </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>REGIONAL HOT SHOTS; REGIONAL POT SHOTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  One of two political flaps that transpired during </p><p>the SESAME meeting was over the location of the next </p><p>training session.  In what could be described as either an </p><p>unintentional shortsighted blunder or a deliberate attempt </p><p>to isolate a member country, the training committee, chaired </p><p>by a scientist from Iran, recommended Isfahan, Iran.  The </p><p>Egyptians quickly supported the suggestion; however, the </p><p>Israeli delegation protested, citing their inability to </p><p>travel to Iran.  After a brief and somewhat heated </p><p>discussion, it was agreed that the Israelis would attempt to </p><p>apply for Iranian visas, since SESAME fell under a UNESCO </p><p>umbrella which may provide some cover, with the </p><p>understanding that if not issued another site would be </p><p>identified for the training. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The second contentious issue was a pointed comment </p><p>by the Palestinian delegation about its good track record in </p><p>meeting financial contribution requirements while their </p><p>Israeli neighbors have thus far not ante-ed up.  The </p><p>Palestinians were quick to point out that they had complied </p><p>under difficult political and economic circumstances and </p><p>questioned more broadly why other member states were </p><p>delinquent.  The charge didn\'t seem to resonate, as many of </p><p>the participating countries are guilty of not contributing </p><p>their $50,000 annual dues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ON THE ROAD . . . . .WITH HAT IN HAND </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Financing remains a major sticking point for </p><p>SESAME.  The 2003 budget is only about $350,000 but seems </p><p>sufficient for what the project is doing at the moment.  On </p><p>the topic of getting donor support for SESAME, Director of </p><p>UNESCO\'s Division of Basic and Engineering Sciences Maciej </p><p>Nalecz (with broad support from the member countries) </p><p>suggested that he and Schopper do a "road show" to </p><p>Washington to pitch SESAME to U.S. policymakers with an eye </p><p>toward getting an earmark from expected U.S. UNESCO funds. </p><p>Possible appointments include the Secretary\'s Science and </p><p>Technology Adviser Dr. Norm Neureiter and OSTP Director Dr. </p><p>John Marburger.  According to Nalecz, Dr. Marburger visited </p><p>UNESCO in April, at which time he was briefed on SESAME and </p><p>expressed interest.  Nalecz also met with Dr. Kathy Olsen, </p><p>Associate Director for Science at OSTP in late June to </p><p>discuss U.S. re-entry into UNESCO.  According to him, Olsen </p><p>indicated that Washington was looking to fund the </p><p>International Oceanographic Commission and satellite </p><p>monitoring of climate change.  Nalecz requested SESAME also </p><p>receive priority attention. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>UNESCO OFF BALANCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  On the separate but related subject of the return </p><p>of the U.S. to UNESCO, Nalecz separately shared with us some </p><p>thoughts and concerns.  He said that UNESCO was "caught off </p><p>guard" by the U.S. announcement last fall by the President </p><p>at the UNGA.  Since then, he admitted, UNESCO has not done a </p><p>good job of consulting with Washington about future U.S. </p><p>contributions.  He said that UNESCO officials assumed that </p><p>the U.S. contributions would expand the current UNESCO </p><p>budget; however, he has since learned that Washington plans </p><p>to contribute its UN dues formula as a percentage of the </p><p>current UNESCO budget.  Effectively, there will be no </p><p>increase in UNESCO funding, just a reapportionment of </p><p>contributions.  Nalecz said the UK has the most to benefit </p><p>from the return of the U.S. to UNESCO, as its financial </p><p>burden will drop the most significantly.  Other countries </p><p>will also benefit, as their contributions will also drop in </p><p>real terms.  He wryly said that Washington had gained </p><p>positive public relations for returning to the organization, </p><p>but not increasing the UNESCO budget.  Moreover, he thought </p><p>this approach would likely have the full backing of the </p><p>poorer nations, as their contributions would be reduced. </p><p>Finally, Nalecz lamented the fact that UNESCO would </p><p>effectively face a nearly $100 million shortfall--the $67 </p><p>million expected from the U.S. (over the next two years) </p><p>would not be supplementing the current UNESCO budget, and </p><p>the approximately $30 million extra budgetary funds from </p><p>Washington--for which he was very grateful--even when it </p><p>wasn\'t a UNESCO member he expected to go away. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
