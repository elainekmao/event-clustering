<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000729 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CJAN, KCRM, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL SWORN IN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) On the morning of March 6 President Obasanjo swore in </p><p>Kanu Godwin Agabi as Nigeria\'s new Attorney General and </p><p>Minister of Justice.  He takes over the Ministry of Justice </p><p>after the December 24 assassination of Chief Bola Ige. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Agabi was AG from June 1999 till June 2000, when he was </p><p>transferred to the Solid Minerals Ministry, a job he held </p><p>until now.   Like the late Bola Ige, Agabi is a Senior </p><p>Advocate of Nigerian (SAN).  Unlike Ige, Agabi is a member of </p><p>the President\'s political party, the PDP, and he is a devout </p><p>Roman Catholic, frequently leading prayers during the weekly </p><p>Executive Council meetings.  He was born and has spent most </p><p>of his career in or representing the south-south state of </p><p>Cross River.  He has served as a federal Senator, a state </p><p>(Cross River) Commissioner of Finance, and was appointed as a </p><p>prosecutor on the Failed Banks and Financial Malpractices </p><p>Tribunal during the Abacha years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Comment:  The appointment of Agabi was rumored in the </p><p>press and among the chatterati of Abuja but only within the </p><p>last week.  He does not seem to have left a strong impact </p><p>during his last stint as AG, leading us to believe Obasanjo </p><p>put a priority on stability and loyalty over distinguishing </p><p>records in making this selection.  Nevertheless, Agabi\'s past </p><p>experience should allow him to become comfortable with the </p><p>reins of the Justice Ministry in short order.  This is good </p><p>news for us, as we expect to engage him quickly on our </p><p>outstanding requests for cooperation on a variety of law </p><p>enforcement and judicial issues. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
