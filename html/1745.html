<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003119 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE), PD/ECA (SEXTON) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 87/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 06/11/06 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, OPRC, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: BACKGROUND PAPER FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT: BALKANS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE, REASONS E.O. 12958 1.5 </p><p>(B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  FOLLOWS IS AN EMBASSY DRAFT BACKGROUND PAPER FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03119  111605Z </p><p>POSSIBLE VISIT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO THE VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT.  THE VATICAN IS VIGOROUS AND ACTIVE </p><p>IN THE GLOBAL PURSUIT OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  WHILE THE </p><p>VATICAN ASSERTS PUBLICLY THAT A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF ITS </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY IS DEFENSE OF THE HUMAN PERSON (LARGELY </p><p>CONGRUENT WITH THE US SUPPORT FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION, </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS), IN REALITY IT </p><p>FREQUENTLY ACTS JUST LIKE A NATION-STATE IN PURSUING ITS </p><p>OWN PERCEIVED SELF-INTEREST. THE VATICAN IS THUS ACTIVE </p><p>ACROSS AN OUTSIZED NUMBER OF CRISIS AREAS IN EFFORTS TO </p><p>RESOLVE CONFLICT AND PROMOTE RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, AND TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF </p><p>CATHOLICS. IN THE BALKANS, THE VATICAN SEEKS TO PROMOTE </p><p>PEACE AND RECONCILIATION FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, TO </p><p>PROTECT "CATHOLIC" PEOPLE AND INTERESTS, AND TO REINFORCE </p><p>ITS OUTREACH TO THE ORTHODOX WORLD.  A KEY GOAL OF POPE </p><p>JOHN PAUL II IS TO HEAL THE THOUSAND-YEAR SCHISM BETWEEN </p><p>CATHOLICS AND ORTHODOX, IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONTINENT, </p><p>FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS, AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND </p><p>REINFORCED WITH THE UNIFIED SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION OF </p><p>CHRISTIANITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  THE USG HAS ENGAGED THE VATICAN TO PROMOTE </p><p>CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN THE BALKANS.  DURING THE NATO AIR </p><p>CAMPAIGN IN KOSOVO, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE VATICAN TO </p><p>HEAD OFF ITS  CRITICISM OF THE MILITARY ACTION (A PAPAL </p><p>DENUNCIATION OF THE CAMPAIGN AS AN "UNJUST WAR" WOULD </p><p>HAVE MADE ALLIANCE SOLIDARITY THAT MUCH HARDER TO </p><p>SUSTAIN). MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03119  111605Z </p><p>VATICAN TO EXERCISE A MODERATING INFLUENCE ON CROAT- </p><p>NATIONALIST CLERGY IN HERZEGOVINA.  WE HAVE ALSO PROMOTED </p><p>INTER-COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION BY DEVELOPING AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS IN KOSOVO AND BOSNIA IN CONJUNCTION </p><p>WITH VATICAN-AFFILIATED NGO, THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY. </p><p>WITH THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF EMBASSY VATICAN, </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO HOSTED A SUCCESSFUL INTER-RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONFERENCE WITH THE KEY BOSNIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS JUNE 8, </p><p>2001.  THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S PD/ECA OFFICE. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA03119 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
