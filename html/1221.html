(C) SUMMARY. SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE SHARED WITH SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER DR. NKOSAZANA DLAMINI-ZUMA JULY 17 </p><p>USG CONCERNS ABOUT ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN BURUNDI. </p><p>HE RELATED THE CONTENT OF HIS DISCUSSIONS IN CAPE TOWN WITH </p><p>FACILITATOR NELSON MANDELA AND HIS WORD OF CAUTION TO MANDELA </p><p>ABOUT THE DANGER POSED BY ARRIVING AT A PEACE AGREEMENT BEFORE </p><p>THE PARTIES HAD ATTAINED SUFFICIENT OWNERSHIP OF THE AGREEMENT. </p><p>MOREOVER, WOLPE OBSERVED, GAPS REMAINED ON CORE ISSUES. </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA EXPRESSED SATISFACTION OVER MANDELA\'S </p><p>DECISION TO PUSH BACK THE JULY 20 DATE HE HAD SET FOR SIGNING </p><p>A BURUNDI PEACE ACCORD.  ALTHOUGH MANDELA HAS ANNOUNCED A NEW </p><p>SIGNING DATE OF AUGUST 28, ZUMA IS CONFIDENT HE WILL ADJUST </p><p>THAT DATE IF HE SEES A PROBLEM DEVELOPING.  ZUMA EXPRESSED </p><p>RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF MANDELA\'S VISION OF A </p><p>UN BODYGUARD CONTINGENT TO PROTECT LEADERS OF THE 19 BURUNDI </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES.  SHE HAS ADVISED MANDELA TO REVIEW THE UN </p><p>CHARTER TO SEE IF THE PROPOSAL WOULD EVEN FIT THE CHARTER. </p><p>ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROPOSAL COULD BE TAKEN FOR ACTION TO THE </p><p>BODY OF GREAT LAKES PRESIDENTS, CHAIRED BY MUSEVENI, RATHER </p><p>THAN TO THE UN ZUMA PRAISED MANDELA FOR THE PROGRESS HE HAS </p><p>MADE IN THE BURUNDI PEACE PROCESS AND ENCOURAGED SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>WOLPE TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH MANDELA.  MANDELA IS CORRECT, </p><p>ZUMA ASSERTS, TO PUSH THE ARUSHA PROCESS ALONG, BUT HE SHOULD </p><p>ALSO BE MORE PATIENT. SHE WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE U.S. </p><p>HAS DEPOSITED THE USD 500,000 PLEDGED IN SUPPORT OF THE ARUSHA </p><p>PROCESS AND THAT IT WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL USD 500,000. </p><p>ZUMA SUGGESTED THAT ONCE A DRAFT PEACE ACCORD IS ACHIEVED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03959  01 OF 02  190954Z </p><p>EACH PARTY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PUT ON PAPER ITS THOUGHTS </p><p>ABOUT THE DRAFT SO THAT THE FACILITATION TEAM CAN SEE WHERE </p><p>THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND WORK OUT A TIMELY SUSTAINABLE </p><p>COMPROMISE.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT IT IS THE PARTIES THAT MUST </p><p>LIVE WITH THE FINAL ACCORD, AS IT WILL SHAPE THEIR LIVES AND </p><p>THEIR COUNTRY\'S FUTURE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GREAT LAKES SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE MET 7/17 IN </p><p>PRETORIA WITH SOUTH AFRICA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER NKOSAZANA </p><p>DLAMINI-ZUMA AT HER HOME ON THE PRESIDENTIAL COMPOUND. </p><p>AMBASSADOR LEWIS, DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY JAMES YELLIN, </p><p>SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN PRENDERGAST, AND POL COUNSELOR </p><p>(NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED.  JERRY MATSILA, DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS (DFA) ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>AMERICAS, SAT IN ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN SIDE.  SEPTELS REVIEW </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON THE DRC AND CANDIDACY FOR THE UN SECURITY </p><p>SEAT CURRENTLY HELD BY NAMIBIA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>CONVEYING APPRECIATION YET CAUTION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WOLPE INITIATED WITH A BRIEF OF HIS MEETING JULY 16 </p><p>WITH DFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR AFRICA, WELILE NHLAPO, </p><p>AND THE MORNING OF JULY 17 IN CAPE TOWN WITH FACILITATOR </p><p>NELSON MANDELA (BOTH MEETINGS REPORTED SEPTELS).  WOLPE SAID </p><p>HE CONVEYED TO MANDELA U.S. APPRECIATION FOR THE PROGRESS THAT </p><p>HAD BEEN ACHIEVED TO DATE IN THE QUEST FOR A SUSTAINABLE </p><p>BURUNDI PEACE.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CAUTIONED OF THE DANGER </p><p>POSED BY ARRIVING AT AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THE PARTIES HAD </p><p>ATTAINED SUFFICIENT OWNERSHIP OF THE AGREEMENT.  WOLPE SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03959  01 OF 02  190954Z </p><p>HE HAD ALSO POINTED OUT THAT WHILE THE PARTIES CONCURRED IN </p><p>SOME AREAS, GAPS REMAINED ON CORE ISSUES.  HIS THEME EXPRESSED </p><p>TO BOTH NHLAPO AND MANDELA HAD BEEN THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>"SUSTAINABILITY" OF A PEACE ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THERE WAS ALSO DANGER, WOLPE SAID, IN SIGNING A PEACE </p><p>AGREEMENT BEFORE A CEASE-FIRE WAS IN PLACE.  WOLPE SAID MANDELA </p><p>HAD BEEN ATTENTIVE TO THIS POINT AND HAD SPOKEN OF THE NEED FOR </p><p>A PUBLIC DECLARATION BY THE REBELS IN ADVANCE OF AN AGREEMENT, </p><p>COMMITTING TO A CEASE-FIRE THAT WOULD BECOME EFFECTIVE WITH </p><p>THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT.  MANDELA HAD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED, </p><p>WOLPE SAID, THAT THE ISSUE OF TRANSITIONAL LEADERSHIP OF BURUNDI </p><p>WAS STILL NOT RESOLVED.  IN ADDITION, OTHER COMPLICATED </p><p>QUESTIONS REMAINED UNRESOLVED, SUCH AS, WHO IS A "POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONER".  STILL, WOLPE SAID, MANDELA HAD NOW, CONTRARY TO AN </p><p>EARLIER DECLARATION, RECOGNIZED THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF </p><p>IMMEDIATELY MOVING THE PEACE PROCESS TO BURUNDI.  HE WILL </p><p>INSTEAD OPEN A FACILITATOR\'S OFFICE IN BUJUMBURA TO ASSIST </p><p>IN PREPARING FOR THE TRANSITION.  WHILE MANDELA AGREES THAT </p><p>SIGNING OF AN AGREEMENT CANNOT OCCUR ON JULY 20, HE HAS NOW </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT HE EXPECTS TO CONCLUDE SUCH AN AGREEMENT ON </p><p>AUGUST 28.  ZUMA RESPONDED THAT SHE WAS GLAD THAT THE JULY 20 </p><p>SIGNING DATE HAD BEEN MOVED AND ADDED, SUBSEQUENTLY, THAT </p><p>"EVEN IF HE HAS ANNOUNCED SIGNING ON AUGUST 28, HE WILL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5387 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03959  02 OF 02  190955Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------6FE58A  190955Z /22 </p><p>O 190905Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6649 </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, BY, TX, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA SHARES VIEWS ON BURUNDI WITH </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY WOLPE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03959  02 OF 02  190955Z </p><p> </p><p>ADJUST THAT IF HE SEES A PROBLEM." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>UN OR COUNTRY BODYGUARD CONTINGENT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WOLPE ALSO SHARED WITH ZUMA MANDELA\'S VISION OF A </p><p>UN BODYGUARD CONTINGENT THAT WOULD OFFER PROTECTION FOR </p><p>ALL LEADERS OF THE 19 PARTIES AT ARUSHA.  IF THIS WERE NOT </p><p>FEASIBLE, MANDELA HAD TOLD WOLPE, THEN A COUNTRY COULD BE </p><p>ASKED TO ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY, ALTHOUGH NOT SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA IN ORDER TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE THAT HE, AS A SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN, WAS PROMOTING A ROLE FOR SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ZUMA SAID SHE HAD SPOKEN BRIEFLY, NOT EXTENSIVELY, </p><p>WITH MANDELA AND HE HAD MENTIONED TO HER ALL THE ELEMENTS </p><p>WOLPE HAD RAISED, INCLUDING SIGNING AN AGREEMENT ON JULY 20. </p><p>ALL INDICATIONS WERE, SHE CONTINUED, THAT A SIGNING ON THAT </p><p>DATE WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE; SHE WELCOMED THE NEWS THAT </p><p>MANDELA HAD MOVED UP THE PROSPECTIVE SIGNING DATE.  ON THE </p><p>MATTER OF UN BODYGUARDS, ZUMA SAID SHE HAD ADVISED MANDELA </p><p>TO LOOK AT THE UN CHARTER TO SEE IF SUCH A PROPOSAL WOULD FIT. </p><p>IF THE INTENT IS TO OFFER PROTECTION FOR A FEW INDIVIDUALS, </p><p>PERHAPS THIS COULD BE TAKEN UP BY THE BODY OF GREAT LAKES </p><p>PRESIDENTS, CHAIRED BY PRESIDENT MUSEVENI, RATHER THAN BY </p><p>THE UN.  MANDELA WILL DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THE OTHER </p><p>PRESIDENTS AT THE ARUSHA MEETING ON JULY 19, ZUMA SAID. </p><p>MANDELA HAD FEARED, ZUMA CONTINUED, THAT INDIVIDUAL </p><p>NEGOTIATORS MIGHT BE KILLED BY THOSE WHO QUESTIONED THEIR </p><p>LEGITIMACY TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.  SHE NOTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03959  02 OF 02  190955Z </p><p>THAT MANY OF THESE NEGOTIATORS REPRESENTED THEMSELVES ONLY. </p><p>ZUMA REMARKED THAT MANDELA "HAS DONE VERY WELL AND IS </p><p>LEARNING ABOUT BURUNDI AS HE GOES ALONG.  HE STARTED LATE, </p><p>BUT HAS BEEN BRIEFED.  EVEN GOING TO BURUNDI HAS OPENED </p><p>HIS EYES AND HE IS ABLE TO TALK WITH BURUNDIANS OF ALL </p><p>PERSUASION."  SHE SURMISED THAT MANDELA BENEFITED BY </p><p>INTERACTION WITH OTHERS ON THE ISSUES. "IT IS IMPORTANT," </p><p>SHE ADVISED WOLPE, "THAT YOU KEEP A DIALOGUE GOING WITH HIM." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>STRUCTURING A SUSTAINABLE PEACE DOCUMENT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WOLPE EXPRESSED TO ZUMA HIS CONCERN THAT IT MIGHT </p><p>TAKE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR TO REACH A SUSTAINABLE ACCORD. </p><p>BOTH NHLAPO AND DON MATTEO ZUPPI BELIEVE THAT THE AGREEMENT </p><p>DOCUMENT NEEDS TO BE DIGESTED BY THE PARTIES.  THERE WILL BE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES ON THE LARGER ISSUES, EVEN ON THE PROPOSAL OF A </p><p>50-50 SPLIT OF REPRESENTATION IN THE BURUNDI ARMY.  AT SOME </p><p>POINT, WOLPE SAID, THE FIVE OR SIX KEY PLAYERS WILL NEED </p><p>TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER TO RESOLVE ALL REMAINING ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ZUMA SUGGESTED THAT ONCE THE DOCUMENT IS RECEIVED, </p><p>EACH PARTY SHOULD BE ASKED TO PUT HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE </p><p>DOCUMENT ON PAPER SO THAT THE FACILITATION TEAM CAN SEE </p><p>WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND WORK OUT A SUSTAINABLE </p><p>COMPROMISE.  ZUMA EXPLAINED THAT THE PARTIES "HAVE TO LIVE </p><p>WITH" THE FINAL PEACE AGREEMENT. "IT WILL AFFECT THEIR LIVES. </p><p>IT HAS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.  SUSTAINABILITY </p><p>MEANS LIVING WITH IT AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE THEY CAN LIVE </p><p>WITH IT."  SHE CONTINUED: "I THINK HE (MANDELA) IS RIGHT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03959  02 OF 02  190955Z </p><p>PUSH THE PROCESS TO MOVE, BUT HE SHOULD FACILITATE AGREEMENT. </p><p>HE SHOULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT PATIENT."  HOWEVER, SHE ADDED </p><p>THAT SHE THOUGHT MANDELA\'S ACTIONS WERE INTENDED PRIMARILY </p><p>TO PUSH THE PARTIES ALONG. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WOLPE ALSO ADVISED ZUMA THAT THE USD 500,000 PLEDGED </p><p>BY THE U.S. IN SUPPORT OF THE ARUSHA PROCESS HAS BEEN </p><p>DEPOSITED AND AN ADDITIONAL USD 500,000 WILL FOLLOW.  ZUMA </p><p>EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THIS NEWS.  SHE ADDED THAT </p><p>MANDELA HAS ACTUALLY DONE VERY WELL.  LAST YEAR, BEFORE </p><p>NYERERE DIED, MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT BURUNDI HAD TAKEN PLACE </p><p>BUT THOSE TALKS HAD NOT INCLUDED THE REBELS.  WOLPE SECONDED </p><p>ZUMA\'S OBSERVATION, ADDING THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO DISCUSSION </p><p>ON CORE ISSUES UNTIL MANDELA BECAME FACILITATOR.  ZUMA AGAIN </p><p>EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR PATIENCE "SO THAT THE GOOD WORK IS </p><p>SUSTAINED" AND INDICATED HER INTENTION TO TALK TO MANDELA </p><p>WHEN HE RETURNED FROM ARUSHA AFTER HIS MEETINGS ON JULY 20. </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
