MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-09-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, ECPS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace process update:  Detainees go on </p><p>hunger strike; Tensions in east; Tamil Tiger radio </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1858, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Demanding immediate release, Tamil detainees go on </p><p>hunger strike </p><p> </p><p>-- Amid strong hints that a resolution may be near, </p><p>standoff involving captured soldiers continues </p><p> </p><p>-- Tigers reportedly attack office of pro-government </p><p>Tamil party </p><p> </p><p>-- Continuing cyclical trend, Muslims in east said to be </p><p>riled over what they consider their marginalization </p><p> </p><p>-- The flavor of the peace process:  After years of </p><p>clandestine operations, "Voice of the Tigers" radio said </p><p>to want official frequency </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Detainees go on Hunger Strike </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) About 150 Tamil detainees with suspected ties to </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been on </p><p>a hunger strike since October 1.  The detainees are </p><p>demanding their immediate release from jails in Kalutara </p><p>(south of Colombo) and Batticaloa in the east.  The </p><p>prisoners assert that the law they are being held under, </p><p>the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), is unfair and </p><p>should be repealed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The situation is becoming a bit of a cause </p><p>celebre.  Various GSL ministers have been streaming to </p><p>the jail to urge the prisoners to break their fast. </p><p>Under pressure from the government, the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office has also announced that it will see </p><p>what it can do to obtain early releases for some of </p><p>those detained.  (Note:  The AG\'s office has already </p><p>taken steps that have resulted in the release of </p><p>hundreds of PTA suspects this year.  Many of those </p><p>currently detained are reportedly hard-core LTTE </p><p>operatives, who were engaged in clear-cut terrorist- </p><p>related activities.)  Tamil politicians are also turning </p><p>up the heat and are scheduled to visit Kalutara today to </p><p>check on the detainees\' health.  (Note:  Most of the </p><p>detainees seem to be in good health, but some are </p><p>reportedly growing quite weak.)  Supporting the </p><p>strikers, G.G. Ponnambalam, a senior Tamil National </p><p>Alliance MP, told us that the government must "remove </p><p>the PTA" because it is "contrary to all humanitarian </p><p>law." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  The detainees have chosen a clever </p><p>tactic:  Perhaps because of Mahatma Gandhi\'s regional </p><p>legacy, hunger strikes -- despite a ritualistic quality </p><p>-- spark sympathy in Sri Lanka.  That said, our guess is </p><p>that the uproar over this issue is LTTE-generated to a </p><p>large extent.  The following sequence of events is </p><p>almost certainly more than a coincidence:   The LTTE </p><p>delegates at the recent peace talks in Thailand raise </p><p>the PTA issue with the GSL team, but to no avail.  Two </p><p>weeks later the detainees begin a hunger strike, which </p><p>is publicly (and loudly) supported by pro-LTTE Tamil </p><p>politicians.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Standoff May Be Resolved Soon </p><p>============================= </p><p>5.  (SBU) Amid some positive noises that a resolution </p><p>may be very near, the standoff over the LTTE\'s detention </p><p>of six Sri Lankan soldiers continues.  (Note:  The </p><p>soldiers have been held by the LTTE since their </p><p>September 25 capture in Trincomalee District.  One other </p><p>soldier was released last week on humanitarian grounds.) </p><p>Despite vigorous entreaties from the GSL and the Sri </p><p>Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), the LTTE has refused to </p><p>release the soldiers until two of its own cadre are </p><p>released in a de facto exchange.  Extensive pressure has </p><p>been put on the GSL to take steps against the LTTE and </p><p>force the group to resolve the dispute (see Reftel). </p><p>Choosing a softer approach, the GSL arranged a bail </p><p>hearing for the two LTTE cadre on October 7.  The SLMM </p><p>told us that the incident may be resolved as early as </p><p>later today.  (Note:  Mission has received late word </p><p>that the LTTE cadre were released early October 9 after </p><p>obtaining bail and that the soldiers\' release also may </p><p>be imminent.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  The government\'s first priority </p><p>throughout this incident has been to defuse it as </p><p>quickly as possible so that it did not prove disruptive </p><p>for the peace process.  With the LTTE playing </p><p>unrelenting hard ball, that strategy has not been </p><p>totally successful.  In playing this game, the LTTE may </p><p>reap a short-term gain by obtaining the release of its </p><p>cadre.  In the longer term, however, the group has </p><p>dented its image as a cooperative partner in the peace </p><p>process -- and made the GSL look weak in the process. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>===================================== </p><p>Tigers Reportedly Attack Party Office </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) LTTE operatives are being accused of attacking </p><p>the office of a pro-government Tamil party on October 5. </p><p>The incident reportedly involved an attack by a group of </p><p>lightly armed men on an office of the Eelam People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (EPDP) on Delft Island off the coast of </p><p>Jaffna.  Several people were lightly injured in the </p><p>melee and there was some damage to the EPDP\'s office. </p><p>The EPDP, which has also claimed that one of its party </p><p>members was briefly abducted, has placed blame on the </p><p>Tigers, asserting that the attack was led by a LTTE </p><p>operative named "Carter."  (Note:  This is another </p><p>interesting LTTE nom de guerre, following along the </p><p>lines of other cadre we have heard of with White House- </p><p>flavored names like "Kennedy" and "Reagan."  We are not </p><p>sure what the gag is here, but it is apparently amusing </p><p>to the LTTE.  End Note.)  For its part, the LTTE has </p><p>denied involvement.  The SLMM is investigating the </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment:  The EPDP acted as a pro-government </p><p>paramilitary organization for years before it agreed to </p><p>disarm earlier this year.  (Note:  Along with several </p><p>other Tamil paramilitary groups, the EPDP did turn in </p><p>some of its weapons.  It is said to have retained some, </p><p>however.)  The group, which has been largely pro-peace </p><p>process in its public utterances, has long maintained </p><p>strength in the islands off Jaffna.  The LTTE has been </p><p>actively challenging the EPDP\'s political control of the </p><p>islands and it would not be surprising if it was indeed </p><p>behind the Delft attack.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>Tensions in East </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Mission has picked up numerous recent reports </p><p>that Muslims in the east are again very upset over the </p><p>peace process.  The active ingredient in the latest </p><p>uptick in tensions involves recent comments by Rauf </p><p>Hakeem, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader and </p><p>GSL Minister.  In a statement in late September, Hakeem, </p><p>who was a member of the GSL\'s negotiating team during </p><p>the recent Thailand talks, said he did not see the need </p><p>for Muslims in the east to have a separate governing </p><p>council in any interim administration formed for the </p><p>region.  These comments were explosive in the east and </p><p>many eastern Muslim leaders denounced Hakeem.  Jehan </p><p>Perera of the National Peace Council, a local think- </p><p>tank, told us that Hakeem\'s comments were "ill-advised," </p><p>as they signaled to eastern Muslims that they were a </p><p>"marginalized group." </p><p>10.  (C) Comment:  The tensions among Muslims in the </p><p>east are cyclical and Hakeem\'s remarks clearly provoked </p><p>anger after several months of relative calm.  It is not </p><p>clear why Hakeem made his remarks, as it is widely </p><p>agreed that the best path at this time is for both the </p><p>GSL and LTTE to avoid discussion of "big picture" </p><p>structural issues.  Hakeem, who is not from the east, </p><p>also did himself a disservice by reinforcing among </p><p>eastern Muslims the perception, real or imagined, that </p><p>he does not cater to their concerns.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>"Voice of the Tigers" </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The LTTE\'s "Voice of the Tigers" clandestine </p><p>radio service is said to want to obtain a FM frequency </p><p>from the Sri Lankan government.  The LTTE reportedly </p><p>made this request to GSL officials during recent mid- </p><p>level meetings in Kilinochchi, the LTTE\'s headquarters </p><p>in the north.  Confirming that it had heard of the </p><p>LTTE\'s interest in obtaining a frequency, the </p><p>government\'s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission </p><p>(TRC) has told us that the Tigers have not filed an </p><p>official application as of yet.  The TRC says the </p><p>request lies with the Peace Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) In making the request, the Tigers are </p><p>apparently looking for countrywide radio coverage.  At </p><p>this time, the Voice of the Tigers can only be tuned in </p><p>on limited FM and short-wave radio frequencies in </p><p>northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and only at night. </p><p>(Note:  The FM frequency is between 94.1 and 96; the </p><p>short-wave frequency is on 41 meter bands.)  The Tigers </p><p>presumably want all-island coverage in order to reach </p><p>out to Tamils in Colombo and central Sri Lanka (unless </p><p>they also go in for English or Sinhala services, in </p><p>addition to their Tamil-language broadcasts). </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Comment:  The Voice of the Tigers has broadcast </p><p>some pretty bloodcurdling stuff in the past, including </p><p>salutes to the LTTE\'s many terrorist acts.  The fact </p><p>that the Tigers apparently feel comfortable approaching </p><p>the GSL regarding an expansion of services -- and that </p><p>the government seems to be considering the request -- is </p><p>a solid indication of how far the peace process has </p><p>caught on.  It is not clear how popular Tiger radio </p><p>might be if it is ever given wide exposure.  Renditions </p><p>of LTTE "patriotic" music and replays of turgid speeches </p><p>by V. Prabhakaran, the group\'s leader, would probably </p><p>only have a limited appeal in the south, to put it </p><p>mildly.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
