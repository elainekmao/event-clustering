OVERALL, </p><p>BITI EXPRESSED HIS "GRCAT DISAPPOINTMENT" WITH THE </p><p>OBASANJO VISIT.  ALTHOUGH THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT IS </p><p>GENUINELY TRYING TO HELP, ACCORDING TO BITI, HE APPEARS </p><p>TO BE UNDERESTIMATING WHAT MUGABE IS CAPABLE OF. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BITI CONFIRMED THAT OBASANJO HAD, IN A JANUARY </p><p>14 MEETING WITH TSVANGIRAI IN ABUJA, SAID HE WOULD URGE </p><p>MUGABE TO STEP DOWN DURING THE HARARE VISIT.  (NOTE: </p><p>ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL ASSISTANT, GANDI </p><p>MUDZINGWA, WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING IN ABUJA, OBASANJO </p><p>HAD ASKED WHETHER THE MDC WOULD SUPPORT A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SUPPORTING AN EXTENSION OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S MANDATE LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW ARRANGEMENT OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE.)  BITI SAID OBASANJO DID NOT RAISE </p><p>THIS ISSUE IN HIS JANUARY 21 MEETING WITH HIM AND </p><p>TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) CLEARLY, OBASANJO BROKERED NO BREAKTHROUGHS </p><p>DURING HIS BRIEF VISIT.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00200  02 OF 02  221336Z </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT HIS PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT ON ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>POSITIVE, IF ONLY BECAUSE OBASANJO IS ONE OF THE FEW </p><p>PEOPLE WITH INFLUENCE OVCR MUGABE.  IF, AS REPORTED, </p><p>THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT FOCUSED HIS DISCUSSION WITH </p><p>MUGABE ON VIOLENCE, ELECTORAL RULES AND OBSERVERS -- </p><p>INSTEAD OF ON LAND, AS THE GOZ WOULD HAVE PREFERRED -- </p><p>THE VISIT YIELDED SOME INCREMENTAL PROGRESS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IF THERE IS ANY HOPE OF MITIGATING FURTHER POLITICAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE IN ZIMBABWE, OBASANJO WILL NEED TO </p><p>RATCHET UP THE PRESSURE, BY MAKING IT CLEAR TO MUGABE </p><p>THAT HE WILL BE JUDGED ON HIS ACTIONS, NOT HIS </p><p>PROMISES.  WE FOUND INTERESTING OBASANJO\'S STATEMENT TO </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IN ABUJA THAT HE PLANNED TO URGE MUGABE TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>STEP DOWN, AN ISSUE HE EITHER DID NOT RAISE WITH HIS </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN COUNTERPART OR DID NOT CHOOSE TO SHARE WITH </p><p>TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
