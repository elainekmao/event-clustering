(C) DCM delivered reftel points April 27 on UAE </p><p>participation in the Informal International Contact </p><p>Group for Iraq to MFA A/USEC for Political Affairs </p><p>Abdullah Rashed al Nuaimi, noting that the UAE\'s </p><p>regional perspective, its experience with Iraq and its </p><p>port and transportation infrastructure and capable </p><p>business community would add value to the Contact </p><p>Group discussions.

(C) A/USEC Al-Nuaimi underscored the UAEG </p><p>commitment to contributing to Contact Group </p><p>discussions, noting that Shaykh Hamdan had chaired a </p><p>ministerial meeting April 26 at which the Cabinet had </p><p>approved participation.  He said that the government </p><p>was still determining who would represent the UAE in </p><p>the Contact Group, but indicated that the UAE would </p><p>need more than one participant because of its federal </p><p>structure and the role that Dubai stood to play in </p><p>Iraq reconstruction.  He suggested Dubai Ports and </p><p>Customs Authority Executive Chairman Sultan bin </p><p>Sulayim as a likely participant.  On April 28, MFA </p><p>MINSTATE Hamdan bin Zayed called the Ambassador to </p><p>confirm that three UAE officials would participate in </p><p>the April 29 teleconference: Abdullah Rashed Al- </p><p>Nuaimi, Finance MINSTATE Dr. Mohamed Khalfan bin </p><p>Khirbash and Sultan bin Sulayim.
