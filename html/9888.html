<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001486 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAIN COMMUNIST PARTY WILL NOT JOIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR THE PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1419 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a meeting on August 4 with the leader of </p><p>Nepal\'s largest legal communist party, Madhav Kumar Nepal, </p><p>the Ambassador expressed concern that the Government\'s </p><p>cease-fire with the Maoists might not continue for long and </p><p>emphasized the need for the political parties and the King to </p><p>unite against the Maoist threat.  Nepal agreed that the </p><p>cease-fire might not last, suggesting that the Thapa </p><p>government\'s negotiating position was weak and, therefore, </p><p>resumption of violence would be necessary to alter the </p><p>balance of power against the Maoists.  Nepal stated that his </p><p>party would not participate in either the peace talks or the </p><p>current government until both the Maoists and the King had </p><p>demonstrated a commitment to multiparty democracy and </p><p>recognized the independence and sovereignty of the political </p><p>parties.  According to Nepal, UML will only participate in </p><p>government either under a reconstituted parliament or an </p><p>all-party government chosen by the parties without the King\'s </p><p>interference.  Nepal accepted that foreign governments and </p><p>international organizations might have a role to play in </p><p>promoting the peace process by pressuring the King to empower </p><p>the parties as well as the Maoists to abandon violence.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 4, Ambassador Malinowski met with the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UMLN) </p><p>Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal to convey reftel message and to </p><p>gauge the party\'s interest in joining Prime Minister Thapa\'s </p><p>government.  DCM and PolOff also attended the meeting.  The </p><p>Ambassador said he was glad that the Maoists had agreed to a </p><p>third round of talks, but was worried that the current </p><p>entente would not hold for long.  He credited Maoist </p><p>supporters who pressured the insurgent leaders to return to </p><p>the negotiating table and expressed gratitude for the actions </p><p>by UML in this regard.   He mentioned that the major foreign </p><p>governments represented in Kathmandu, including the U.S., UK </p><p>and India, had agreed to send a common message to the Maoists </p><p>condemning the insurgents\' flagrant violations of the </p><p>cease-fire code of conduct and pressing them to return to the </p><p>peace talks.  The Ambassador emphasized the need for the </p><p>King, government and the political parties to unite against </p><p>the Maoist threat for the good of the nation.  He noted that </p><p>the Maoists had called for the parties to join the peace </p><p>talks and questioned the UML chairman on whether this was a </p><p>possibility. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nepal replied that UML would not participate in the </p><p>peace talks until the Maoists demonstrated a commitment to </p><p>multiparty democracy and recognized the independence and </p><p>sovereignty of the political parties.  Ongoing Maoist </p><p>activities, such as extortion, kidnapping and forced </p><p>recruitment have proven that the insurgents\' philosophy does </p><p>not embrace democracy, he said.  The Maoists have also shown </p><p>their lack of commitment to democracy by declining to sign a </p><p>code of conduct prepared by the UML to protect local-level </p><p>party cadres, he said.  Nepal noted that the Maoist supreme </p><p>leader, Prachanda, had called for the political parties\' </p><p>involvement in the peace talks, but had qualified the offer </p><p>by demanding that the parties choose sides, which they </p><p>refused to do. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nepal believed that there are philosophical </p><p>differences within the Maoist leadership.  He said that "we </p><p>should encourage and promote the flexible and reasonable </p><p>people within the Maoist organization while the diehards and </p><p>those who want to return to violence should be isolated and </p><p>disgraced."  Despite these differences, Nepal opined that the </p><p>Maoists continue to fight from what, they believe, is a </p><p>position of power.  Only after the Maoists realize they are </p><p>weak, he said, will they compromise on their political </p><p>demands. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nepal said that the talks between the Thapa government </p><p>and the Maoists would not succeed since the government </p><p>appeared weak and lacked political legitimacy.   Moreover, </p><p>Nepal explained, the political parties would regard any </p><p>agreement between the King and the Maoists as a conspiracy </p><p>against their interests.  He believed that, by conceding to </p><p>demands to release three Maoist Central Committee leaders and </p><p>one of the major Maoist extortionists, the Thapa government </p><p>had shown its weakness and given an advantage to the Maoists. </p><p> Nepal reported that the Maoists have claimed that their </p><p>cadre has grown to 150,000 combatants.  Although many </p><p>so-called Maoists will likely flee at the onset of </p><p>hostilities, many others "will be bold enough to risk their </p><p>lives," he said. (Comment.  Post does not agree with Nepal\'s </p><p>assessment that the Maoists are negotiating from a position </p><p>of strength.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Nepal agreed that foreign governments, international </p><p>organizations and human rights groups all have a role to play </p><p>in the peace process.  Foreign governments, he said, should </p><p>exert pressure through persuasion to convince the Maoists </p><p>that they cannot win through violence.  Nepal argued that the </p><p>Government of India in particular should be concerned about </p><p>Maoist activities in its own country.  The insurgents in </p><p>northern India have become stronger, he said, and therefore </p><p>the human and financial costs of dealing with the problem </p><p>have increased. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador noted the reaction within the Indian </p><p>media in recent days criticizing offers by the United Nations </p><p>to assist in the peace negotiations.  Nepal replied that </p><p>although neither the government nor the Maoists were ready </p><p>for a direct U.N. role in the talks, the U.N. could train </p><p>facilitors, bring in negotiators from other countries, and </p><p>assist in laying the groundwork for a post-conflict </p><p>reconciliation plan.  However, Nepal also acknowledged the </p><p>Indian government\'s unhappiness with U.N. and other agencies\' </p><p>offers of assistance. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Nepal agreed with the Ambassador that the Maoists are </p><p>the sole beneficiaries of the ongoing conflict between King </p><p>Gyanendra and the political parties.  The constitutional </p><p>forces should not undermine one another\'s efforts against the </p><p>unconstitutional forces, he said.  However, he placed </p><p>responsibility for bringing the two sides together on the </p><p>King\'s shoulders.  "If he shows flexibility, then we will </p><p>show flexibility," he said.  Nepal criticized the King for </p><p>not demonstrating a commitment to democracy, calling his rule </p><p>a "one-party dictatorship."   Nepal emphasized that the </p><p>King\'s actions have effectively "paralyzed" the consitution, </p><p>noting the King\'s abrogation of constitutional provisions </p><p>regarding the National Assembly and the budget.  He suggested </p><p>that the King should stay out of politics completely and </p><p>become a "noncontroversial, but dignified, constitutional </p><p>monarch." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) When asked whether he had a formula to bring the </p><p>democratic forces together, Nepal stated that restoration of </p><p>the parliament could bring the political parties into the </p><p>government.  Alternatively, Prime Minister Thapa\'s government </p><p>must resign and the King must allow the political parties to </p><p>choose an all-party cabinet without interference.  Nepal </p><p>hinted that, of course, the political party leaders would </p><p>consult informally with the King, but that the King should </p><p>remove himself from public political life.  Under no </p><p>conditions could the UML participate in the current </p><p>government, he said. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) An interim government, Nepal stated, would first </p><p>focus on reaching an agreement with the Maoists.  However, he </p><p>suggested that the two sides would first need to return to </p><p>war.  Only after the national army delivers firm set backs to </p><p>the Maoists in the field and puts greater pressure on them </p><p>can peace talks succeed, he said.  Nepal agreed that </p><p>elections could not be held until the threat of violence is </p><p>gone from the countryside.  When asked whether he believed </p><p>the political parties could agree upon an all-party cabinet, </p><p>Nepal said "there is no way to say now."  However, Nepal\'s </p><p>international affairs advisor opined that the parties could </p><p>reach an agreement, although the "window of opportunity" </p><p>might soon disappear."  Nepal suggested that the seven </p><p>parties that had been elected to the last parliament would </p><p>need to participate in an interim government. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
