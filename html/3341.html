<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003580 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: ITALY ON BILATERAL AGREEMENT TO PROTECT U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS FROM THE ICC </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 135262 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CDA THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03580  191604Z </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: WHILE MINDFUL THAT THE U.S. FACES A GREATER </p><p>RISK OF ALLEGATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT </p><p>(ICC) THAN DO OTHER STATES, THE GOI REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE </p><p>ICC AND CRITICAL OF USG STEPS THAT APPEAR AIMED AT </p><p>UNDERMINING THE COURT.  THE GOI WILL STUDY CAREFULLY THE US </p><p>PROPOSAL TO ENTER INTO A BILATERAL ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JULY 19, CDA AND POLOFF DELIVERED REF DEMARCHE </p><p>SEPARATELY TO GIANCARLO ARAGONA, THE MFA\'S POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR, AND TO PAOLO DIONISI, DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO </p><p>PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI.  ARAGONA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>U.S., DUE TO ITS SPECIAL POSITION IN THE WORLD, FACES A </p><p>GREATER RISK OF ALLEGATIONS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND PROSECUTIONS </p><p>UNDER THE ICC THAN DO MOST OTHER STATES.  HE SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE GOI AND THE EU DISAGREE WITH THE U.S. POSITION ON </p><p>THE ICC.  THERE ARE ENOUGH SAFEGUARDS IN THE ICC THAT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED PROSECUTION BY THE ICC </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S. IS SO REMOTE AS TO BE PURELY  HYPOTHETICAL, </p><p>HE ARGUED.  THE ITALIAN PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORT THE ICC AND THE GOI WOULD HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN </p><p>APPROACHING A BILATERAL AGREEMENT THAT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>UNDERMINING IT.  THE U.S. HAS EVERY RIGHT TO PROTECT ITS </p><p>CITIZENS, SAID ARAGONA, BUT ITS POSITION ON THE ICC IS </p><p>PERCEIVED BY MANY AS AN IDEOLOGICAL ONE, AGAINST THE CONCEPT </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BEING UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE.  HE FOUND </p><p>IT PARTICULARLY "INCOMPREHENSIBLE" THAT THE USG WAS GOING </p><p>BEYOND MEASURES TO PROTECT ITS PERSONNEL, INTO AN ALL-OUT </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE COURT BY URGING STATES NOT TO SIGN OR </p><p>RATIFY THE TREATY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03580  191604Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE CDA COUNTERED THAT OUR DESIRE TO HAVE A BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE GOI UNDER ARTICLE 98 OF THE ROME STATUTE </p><p>IS NOT MEANT TO UNDERMINE THE ICC BUT TO ADD A LAYER OF </p><p>PROTECTION FOR U.S. PERSONNEL.  REITERATING POINTS FROM </p><p>REFTEL, HE STRESSED THAT THE U.S. IS COMMITTED TO PREVENTING </p><p>AND PROSECUTING INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES AND SEES DOMESTIC </p><p>JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AS THE PRIMARY MEANS TO DO SO.  THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF OUR </p><p>FRIENDS WOULD NOT ONLY HELP TO PROTECT U.S. CITIZENS </p><p>DIRECTLY, BUT WOULD ALSO DETER POLITICAL MISUSE OF THE COURT </p><p>AND - CONCEIVABLY - COULD LEAD TO A LESSENING OF THE GAP </p><p>BETWEEN US AND EU PERCEPTIONS OF THE COURT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION AT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE, DIONISI ALSO PROMISED THAT THE GOI WOULD STUDY THE </p><p>USG REQUEST CAREFULLY.  HE REFERRED TO BERLUSCONI\'S JULY 17 </p><p>SPEECH (BELOW) AND ITS EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY FOR US CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ON JULY 17, AT THE CEREMONY FOR THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE SIGNING OF THE ICC STATUTE AT FAO HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>ROME, BERLUSCONI DESCRIBED THE CREATION OF THE ICC AS AN </p><p>"HISTORICAL EVENT."  HE SAID THAT CONCERNS OVER NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ICC ARE NORMAL AND THAT THE </p><p>RESERVATIONS OF COUNTRIES "WITH GREATER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES" MUST BE RESPECTED.  STILL, BERLUSCONI </p><p>DESCRIBED THE ICC AS "AN EXTRAORDINARY EVOLUTION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW" AND SAID THAT ITALY WOULD MAKE EVERY </p><p>EFFORT TO CONVINCE COUNTRIES WITH RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE ICC </p><p>TO JOIN THE COURT.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID HE WOULD WORK WITH </p><p>COUNTRIES WHERE HE "HAS MANY FRIENDS" AND WHO LOOK AT "THIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03580  191604Z </p><p>INSTITUTION WITH HOSTILITY", BECAUSE HE THINKS THEIR FEARS </p><p>ARE "UNFOUNDED". </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: EMBASSY WILL FOLLOW UP WITH BOTH MFA AND THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AS A PRIORITY ISSUE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>ARAGONA DID NOT MENTION IT, WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE </p><p>EU DEBATES AND ADOPTS A COMMON POSITION ON THE USG REQUEST. </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY THE PRIME MINISTER, ARE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO USG CONCERNS THAT US OFFICIALS COULD BECOME </p><p>THE PRIMARY TARGETS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS </p><p>BY THE COURT.  THAT IS OUR STRONGEST ASSET IN PRESSING FOR AN </p><p>ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  WORKING AGAINST US IS THE PERCEPTION, </p><p>ARTICULATED BY ARAGONA, THAT THE USG IS GOING BEYOND MEASURES </p><p>TO PROTECT ITS PERSONNEL AND INTO A FULL-COURT PRESS AGAINST </p><p>THE ICC\'S SUCCESSFUL FUNCTIONING.  END COMMENT. </p><p>COUNTRYMAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03580 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
