<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ZAGREB 000489 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PREF, PINR, PREF, PINR, PREF, HR, HRPREL, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO), Refugee, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR REVIEWS PRIORITY ISSUES WITH NEW DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM PATRICK MOON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A MARCH 3 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEW DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SIMONOVIC, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED THE U.S. APPROACH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>ON IRAQ, STEPS TOWARD CROATIA,S CANDIDACY FOR NATO </p><p>MEMBERSHIP, THE SFRY ASSETS SUCCESSION ISSUES, OUR REQUEST </p><p>FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH CROATIA, ICTY COMPLIANCE, </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS AND THE UPCOMING UNCHR SESSION.  SIMONOVIC </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA DOES NOT SEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR ITSELF </p><p>ON IRAQ, BUT STILL WANTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE.  CROATIA WOULD </p><p>READILY PURSUE REGIONAL INITIATIVES (INCLUDING THE ADRIATIC </p><p>CHARTER) BUT DID NOT WANT TO ENDANGER CLOSE TIES TO WESTERN </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  SIMONOVIC SAID CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>BE AN OBSTACLE TO THE UNFREEZING OF SFRY ASSETS AND WANTED A </p><p>QUICK RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE AGREEMENT ON </p><p>SUCCESSION ISSUES.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC MUST DO A BETTER JOB </p><p>ON ICTY AND REFUGEE RETURNS.  ACCORDING TO THE NEW DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER, CROATIA HAS A BRIEF WINDOW REMAINING FOR </p><p>TOUGH DECISIONS; THE UPCOMING ELECTION SEASON WOULD SOON </p><p>CLOSE THE DOOR ON UNPOPULAR ACTIONS BY THE GOC COALITION. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN HIS INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEWLY ARRIVED DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC (UNTIL RECENTLY CROATIA,S UN </p><p>PERMREP) ON MARCH 3, AMBASSADOR ROSSIN ASKED FOR CROATIA\'S </p><p>SUPPORT AT THE UN FOR U.S. OBJECTIVES ON IRAQ.  SIMONOVIC </p><p>SAID HE DID NOT FORESEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR CROATIA AND </p><p>INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE UNSC WOULD APPROVE A SECOND </p><p>RESOLUTION, WHICH WAS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PRESERVING THE </p><p>RELEVANCE AND CREDIBILITY OF THE UN.  HE SPECULATED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO INSTALL TRUE DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ </p><p>GIVEN THE ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS TENSIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS RECENT DECISION TO PERMIT FLOW </p><p>THROUGH OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CARRYING U.S. TROOPS TO THE </p><p>REGION.  WHILE WE DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AT THIS </p><p>TIME, IT WAS POSSIBLE THE U.S. WOULD SEEK ADDITIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS. </p><p> THE U.S. SOUGHT A CLOSE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOC ON THE IRAQ </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>NATO AND CROATIA </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED PROGRESS ON THE ADRIATIC CHARTER </p><p>TEXT AND RECONFIRMED HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING OF THE </p><p>THREE FOREIGN MINISTERS IN DUBROVNIK ON MARCH 7.  HE PRESSED </p><p>FOR A STRONG STATEMENT ON IRAQ IN THE PLANNED DUBROVNIK </p><p>DECLARATION.  REFERRING TO THE CROATIAN LANGUAGE ON </p><p>INDIVIDUAL TRACKS INSERTED INTO THE DRAFT CHARTER, SIMONOVIC </p><p>ADMITTED THAT CROATIA HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO PURSUE REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION FOR FEAR OF CUTTING INCREASINGLY CLOSE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES.  HOWEVER, HE ASSURED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, WITH UNSUAL ANIMATION, THAT CROATIA WAS FULLY </p><p>COMMITTED TO CLOSE COOPERATION WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS AND </p><p>WOULD SEEK TO PROMOTE THE CANDIDACIES OF OTHER MAP COUNTRIES. </p><p> CROATIA WOULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE AT THE EU SUMMIT IN </p><p>THESSALONIKI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT SINCE CROATIA HAD A </p><p>REPUTATION FOR WANTING TO GO ITS OWN WAY, GOC REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>MUST SAY EXPLICITLY AND OFTEN THAT CROATIA SUPPORTS REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION.  A COMPETITIVE APPROACH DENIGRATING OTHER </p><p>ASPIRANTS AND INVITEES DOES NOT HELP CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE U.S. STRONGLY SUPPORTED CROATIA\'S NATO </p><p>ASPIRATIONS AND WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. </p><p>HOWEVER, CROATIA NEEDED TO DO MORE ON DEFENSE REFORMS, ICTY </p><p>COOPERATION, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND JUDICIAL REFORM.  CROATIA </p><p>NEEDED TO PUT OUT A POSITIVE MESSAGE OF PROGRESS ON THESE </p><p>ISSUES AND NOT BE SEEN AS COMBATIVE OR "WHINING" IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM. </p><p> </p><p>ICC ) ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT CROATIA </p><p>WAS WAITING FOR AN EU MEMBER STATE MODEL ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>BEFORE MOVING AHEAD WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>SIMONOVIC CONFIRMED THIS BUT ALSO ASKED THAT THE U.S. NOT </p><p>PRESS TOO HARD FOR AN AGREEMENT, REFERRING TO THE SENSITIVITY </p><p>OF AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT DUE TO PERCEIVED INEQUITIES IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC,S MIND BETWEEN U.S. OBJECTIVES AND CROATIA,S ICTY </p><p>OBLIGATIONS.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA WOULD BE </p><p>READY TO MOVE AHEAD ONCE THERE IS AN EU STATE MODEL </p><p>AGREEMENT.  IN THAT REGARD, HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO MAKE TIMELY PROGRESS ON SUCH A MODEL AGREEMENT.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER THE PROVISIONS </p><p>AND DEADLINE  OF THE ASPA.  WE COULD NOT PREDICT HOW IT WOULD </p><p>BE IMPLEMENTED BUT WAIVERS COULD NOT BE PRESUMED.  CROATIA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8005 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------4028B8  061511Z /38 </p><p>R 061459Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9610 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000489 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PREF, NATO, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR REVIEWS PRIORITY ISSUES WITH NEW DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>MIGHT NEED TO CONSIDER ITS OWN INTERESTS IN THE COMING </p><p>MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>ICTY ISSUES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SIMONOVIC ADMITTED THAT THE GOC HAD HANDLED THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>BOBETKO CASE BADLY, AT LEAST INITIALLY.  THE HAPHAZARDLY </p><p>LAUNCED LEGAL APPROACH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BUT LUCK (E.G., </p><p>WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT) HAD PLAYED TOO LARGE A ROLE. </p><p>BUT THAT CASE WAS NOW "MORE OR LESS" RESOLVED.  IT WAS CLEAR </p><p>THAT CROATIA NEEDED A "SUCCESSFUL CASE" TO DEMONSTRATE ITS </p><p>FULL COMMITMENT TO ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>INDICTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF CROATIAN OFFICERS </p><p>FOR COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY CHARGES DO NOT SIT WELL WITH THE </p><p>CROATIAN PUBLIC.  HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE UP TO FIVE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INDICTMENTS OF CROATIAN CITIZENS BEING STUDIED BY </p><p>THE ICTY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THE BOBETKO CASE WAS NOW </p><p>BEHIND US, BUT WARNED THAT BECAUSE OF GOC SHORTCOMINGS IN THE </p><p>HANDLING OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT, THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WOULD BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE GOC,S </p><p>PERFORMANCE ON ANY NEW INDICTMENTS.  THEY MUST BE HANDLED </p><p>QUICKLY AND QUIETLY TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL COMPLIANCE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE U.S. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY ARE LOOKING FOR MORE ACTIVE AND VIGOROUS GOC </p><p>ACTIONS TO LOCATE AND CAPTURE ICTY INDICTEE GOTOVINA.  WE </p><p>KNEW SPECIFICALLY OF THINGS THE GOC CLAIMED IT WAS DOING TO </p><p>FIND GOTOVINA THAT, IN FACT, IT WAS NOT DOING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ADVISED SIMONOVIC THAT THE U.S. WAS </p><p>PREPARING TO RE-LAUNCH ITS INITIATIVE TO ASSIST THE GOC WITH </p><p>LOCAL WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS.  HE ANTICIPATED A U.S. </p><p>PROPOSAL SOON FOR A U.S. TEAM TO VISIT IN APRIL OR MAY. </p><p>SIMONOVIC WELCOMED THIS, REFERRING TO PROPOSED REFORMS IN THE </p><p>JUDICIAL SECTOR AND PLANS TO ESTABLISH FOUR REGIONAL COURTS </p><p>TO TRY WAR CRIMES CASES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z </p><p> </p><p>UNCHR SESSION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9  (C) THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED SIMONOVIC THAT THE LINE UP IN </p><p>THIS YEAR,S UNCHR SESSION WAS BAD, STARTING WITH LIBYA,S </p><p>INSTALLATION AS CHAIRMAN.  THE U.S. WANTED TO WORK CLOSELY </p><p>WITH CROATIA TO PROMOTE A PRODUCTIVE SESSION.  SIMONOVIC </p><p>FULLY AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR,S POINTS, NOTING CROATIA\'S </p><p>BOARD PARTICIPATION THIS YEAR.  HE LAMENTED EXCESSIVE </p><p>POLITIZATION IN THE FORUM. </p><p> </p><p>SFRY -- SUCCESSION ASSETS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE U.S. INTENTION TO UNBLOCK </p><p>SFRY NBY ASSETS LOCATED IN THE U.S.  HE NOTED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>WAS STILL SEEKING A HOLD HARMLESS STATEMENT FROM THE GOC AND </p><p>HOPED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REVERSE ITS OPPOSITION.  HE </p><p>WOULD RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH FM PICULA IN AN UPCOMING MEETING. </p><p> SIMONOVIC RESPONDED THAT CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO BE AN </p><p>OBSTACLE TO THE U.S. INITIATIVE AND URGED THAT BOTH SIDES </p><p>SEEK A SOLUTION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.  HE POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT A GOC DECISION TO ACCEDE TO THE U.S. REQUEST ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE ) LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFICULT ISSUES BEFORE THE </p><p>GOC ) WOULD NOT SIT WELL WITH THE PUBLIC.  WITH ELECTIONS </p><p>EXPECTED EITHER THIS FALL OR PERHAPS EARLY NEXT YEAR, THE GOC </p><p>WOULD WANT TO MAKE THE UNPLEASANT DECISIONS BEFORE THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION WINDOW CLOSED IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AGREED AND ADDED HIS HOPE THAT A GOC DECISION TO </p><p>FOREGO $50 MILLION PLUS FROM THE NBY DISTRIBUTION WOULD NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>BE USED IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE COALITION. </p><p> </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR CONCERNS REGARDING REFUGEE </p><p>RETURNS ARE ASSUMING STEADILY MORE PROMINENCE IN CROATIA\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  SIMONOVIC SAID THAT CROATIA MUST BE </p><p>MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ON THIS ISSUE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE REAL </p><p>PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WITH ADDRESSING THE TENANCY RIGHTS </p><p>ISSUE.  ON THE TENANCY RIGHTS ISSUE, THE AMBASSADOR URGED </p><p>THAT THE GOC PRIORITIZE ITS ACTIONS AND PUT PRIMARY FOCUS ON </p><p>CASES WHERE ACTUAL REFORMS HINGE ON PROVIDING FARMER TENANTS </p><p>A HOUSING OPTION.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE U.S. AND EU STATES HAD </p><p>NOT SEEN MUCH MOVEMENT ON THIS FROM THE GOC SIDE. </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER CACIC HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING BUT VAGUE </p><p>ON AN ISSUE WHERE CONCRETE STEPS ARE HUGELY OVERDUE.  PM </p><p>RACAN HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) SIMONOVIC AGREED THAT THE GOC NEEDS TO ACT BUT THAT </p><p>THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WOULD LIMIT THE GOC\'S MANEUVERING </p><p>ROOM.  IN ANY EVENT, HE CLAIMED THAT CROATIAN PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>IS NOW MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD THE RETURN OF CROATIAN </p><p>SERBS.  IN FACT, HE ASSERTED, THE GOC HAS DONE FAR MORE THAN </p><p>WAS THOUGHT POSSIBLE FIVE YEARS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8006 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00489  03 OF 03  061511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------4028C2  061512Z /38 </p><p>R 061459Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9611 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000489 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PREF, NATO, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR REVIEWS PRIORITY ISSUES WITH NEW DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) SIMONOVIC IMPRESSED US AS A BUSINESSLIKE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL WITH WHOM WE CAN DO BUSINESS.  PRIOR BILLINGS </p><p>FROM USUN OF A VERY LAWYERLIKE APPROACH WERE AMPLY BORNE OUT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  03 OF 03  061511Z </p><p> HE MAY WELL PROVE TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN FORCING THE LEADEN </p><p>MFA BUREAUCRACY TOWARD TIMELY ACTION AND REASONABLE POSITIONS </p><p>THAT RESPOND TO CONCERNS COMING FROM THE U.S. AND OTHERS IN </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) HOWEVER, WE ARE CONCIOUS THAT HIS BACKGROUND AND </p><p>PAST USG INTERACTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED A STRONG NATIONALIST </p><p>STREAK UNDER THE URBANE SURFACE.  CERTAINLY, IN THE MEETING </p><p>SIMONOVIC PUT THE MOST FAVORABLE SPIN ON EACH RESPONSE, </p><p>HIGHLIGHTING CROATIA\'S HANDICAPS AND "NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING" </p><p>WHILE SEEKING TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A SYMPATHETIC FRIEND TO </p><p>THE U.S. IN A SOMETIMES UNFRIENDLY COURT.  HIS OBSERVATIONS </p><p>ABOUT THE VERY SHORT WINDOW AVAILABLE FOR THE GOC TO TAKE </p><p>UNPOPULAR DECISIONS RANG TRUE, ALTHOUGH THIS COALITION </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS LED BY A PRIME MINISTER WHO SEEKS </p><p>CONSENSUS AT ALL COSTS, HAS SHOWN LITTLE INCLINATION TO TAKE </p><p>UNPOPULAR (EVEN IF NECESSARY) DECISIONS REGARDLESS OF THE </p><p>TIMING. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
