<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, PREL, GM, JA, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: (NIAG 2057) JAPANESE EMBASSY ASKS FOR MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ON IRAQI FRONT COMPANY AL-EMAN INVESTMENT GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 154314 </p><p>     B. TOKYO 5577 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Japanese Embassy Counselor (and Japanese Charge </p><p>in Iraq) Masashi Kono called on PolCouns August 18. </p><p>Referring to Embassy Tokyo\'s demarche (ref b) on Iraq\'s </p><p>possible purchase of thermal luminescence dosimetry equipment </p><p>from Japan through the Jordanian company al-Eman Investment </p><p>Group (ref a), Kono said he had been instructed to learn all </p><p>that he could about al-Eman "from third party sources, </p><p>including the American Embassy."  He passed to PolCouns </p><p>copies of web pages (one from Ohio State University dated </p><p>1996 and one in French from a French magazine) referring </p><p>obliquely to al-Eman and its connection to Iraq.  He also </p><p>noted that German intelligence had told the Japanese </p><p>government that a similarly named "al-Eman Commercial </p><p>Investment Establishment" was on Germany\'s list of likely </p><p>Iraqi front companies. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Translating from an instruction cable in </p><p>Japanese, Kono asked that the Embassy provide any additional </p><p>information available on al-Eman, including its address and </p><p>physical location in Jordan, information on its other </p><p>business activities, the other companies with which it works, </p><p>and more specific evidence of its links with Iraq -- e.g. </p><p>previous trades on behalf of Iraq or numbers of Iraqi </p><p>employees.   Kono said Tokyo decisionmakers needed this </p><p>information to support taking action to prevent any shipment </p><p>of technology through al-Eman to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  COMMENT:  The Japanese Government is obviously </p><p>taking our demarche seriously.  Post would appreciate </p><p>receiving any additional information that addresses the </p><p>Japanese request. </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
