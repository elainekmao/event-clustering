<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RAS, PM </p><p>EUCOM FOR DCINC, POLAD </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, EAID, PINS, MARR, MOPS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OPERATION AVID RECOVERY MADE A DIFFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) I want to express my profound gratitude to our </p><p>colleagues at EUCOM, the NSC, USAID and State (AF and PM) for </p><p>their exceptional support for U.S. relief operations in </p><p>Nigeria since January 27th this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) As all of you know, the catastrophic explosions that </p><p>devastated the Ikeja Cantonment could have had profoundly </p><p>negative consequences on the stability of Nigeria, in </p><p>addition to the tragic loss of life and destruction of </p><p>property that occurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Our response was immediate and genuine.  Resources </p><p>provided through OFDA and the authority to transfer the </p><p>remaining Operation Focus Relief (OFR) supplies to Nigeria </p><p>went a long way in alleviating the initial human suffering </p><p>and demonstrated the caring of the American people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Still, more was needed to ensure that the fledgling </p><p>democracy in Africa,s most populous nation would not be </p><p>diminished by this tragic development.  When President </p><p>Obasanjo first discussed with me his special appeal to </p><p>President Bush for further assistance, the deep concern on </p><p>his face told the whole story. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) President Bush,s quick and positive response to </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s request underlined the importance of </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria relations and our gratitude for Nigeria\'s </p><p>support following our own national horrors on September 11. </p><p>However, the execution of President Bush,s decision fell to </p><p>all of you.  Because of the hard work of those in Washington </p><p>and at EUCOM, Operation Avid Recovery was implemented quickly </p><p>and was a shining success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) I would also like to express my deep appreciation to </p><p>our highly professional soldiers and airmen, who, working </p><p>hand-in-hand with our colleagues at the Consulate General in </p><p>Lagos, carried out the daunting tasks of medical support for </p><p>the operation, disposal of the ordnance, and public education </p><p>on its dangers.  These brave and professional men and women </p><p>made us all very proud, and were outstanding representatives </p><p>of our country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The good work still continues.  A State Department </p><p>contractor is currently gearing up for 90 days of further UXO </p><p>clearance, which will make the tragedy of January 27th </p><p>eventually fade into history. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Nigeria is entering a very difficult period for this </p><p>young democracy.  Elections are approaching, and tensions may </p><p>run high.  Regardless of the electoral outcome, America has </p><p>sent a powerful message to this nation: when the chips were </p><p>down, and our friend was in need, the United States offered a </p><p>hand of friendship and support. I suspect that the people of </p><p>this country will not forget what you did here. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
