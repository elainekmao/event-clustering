<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HARARE 002771 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT, AF/P, </p><p>INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS1: MEDIA REPORTING ON TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 161795 </p><p> </p><p>1.   MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO CARRY OPINION </p><p>    PIECES AND OP-ED ARTICLES FOCUSING ON THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>    BOMBINGS OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE </p><p>    PENTAGON.  THESE ARTICLES BOTH REFLECT AND LEAD </p><p>    ZIMBABWEAN POPULAR OPINION ON THE ATTACKS.  IN </p><p>    GENERAL, THE ZIMBABWEAN MOOD IS THAT THE ATTACKS </p><p>    WERE HORRIBLE AND SENSELESS ASSAULTS ON INNOCENT </p><p>    PEOPLE.  EXPRESSIONS OF CONDOLENCE HAVE BEEN </p><p>    POURING IN TO THE U.S. MISSION IN ZIMBABWE.  AT </p><p>    THE SAME TIME, THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT OF PUBLIC </p><p>    OPINION ALONG THE LINES OF ".THE U.S. MUST EXPECT </p><p>    TO PAY SOME PRICE FOR ITS SINS AND SELF-ASSUMED </p><p>    ROLE OF GLOBAL POLICEMAN."  ZIMBABWEANS ARE ALSO </p><p>    CONCERNED ABOUT THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS </p><p>    AND, TRUE TO THEIR NATURE, GENERALLY ENDORSE </p><p>    PATIENCE AND PRUDENCE.  ARTICLE EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE \'U. S. MUST SEARCH DEEP WITHIN ITS </p><p>    CONSCIENCE," THE SEPTEMBER 20 EDITION OF THE </p><p>    INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" </p><p>    CARRIED THE FOLLOWING OPINION PIECE AUTHORED BY </p><p>    MAGGIE MZUMARA, A ZIMBABWEAN JOURNALIST, WRITER </p><p>    AND SOCIAL COMMENTATOR CURRENTLY BASED IN NEW </p><p>    YORK: </p><p> </p><p>    ". . .(AMERICA) IS A NATION HUMBLED, A NATION </p><p>ROBBED, </p><p>    AND A NATION OUTRAGED.  TRUE, ALL THAT.  BUT AT </p><p>    SOME POINT AMERICA HAS TO STOP DWELLING ON ONLY </p><p>    \'WHAT\' HAS HAPPENED AND \'HOW\' IT HAS HAPPENED AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02771  01 OF 04  201404Z </p><p>    LOOK AT SOME FACTS. . .  TO CONCENTRATE ONLY ON </p><p>    AND TO STOP AT \'SMOKING OUT BIN LADEN FROM HIS </p><p>    HIDING HOLES\' AND WIPING AWAY ALL THOSE WHO </p><p>    \'HARBOR TERRORISTS\' IS AT BEST INCOMPLETE AND AT </p><p>    WORST MISSING THE POINT.  I AM NOT SAYING AMERICA </p><p>    IS NOT JUSTIFIED IN SEEKING JUSTICE.  IT IS AND </p><p>    IF THE JUSTICE TO THE AMERICANS INCLUDES </p><p>    RETALIATING MILITARILY, SO BE IT.  BUT THAT KIND </p><p>    OF JUSTICE WILL AND CAN ONLY BE MEANINGFUL IF IT </p><p>    IS ACCOMPANIED BY A DEEPER LOOK AT THE ROOT </p><p>    CAUSES OF THE FEELINGS BEHIND LAST WEEK\'S </p><p>    CATASTROPHE. . .  BUT AMERICA HAS THREE </p><p>    WEAKNESSES.  THREE MAJOR VICES: RUTHLESSNESS, </p><p>    SELFISHNESS AND ARROGANCE.  AMERICA IS ARROGANT. </p><p>    SO ARROGANT IN FACT THAT IT IS NOW, AS IN THE </p><p>    PAST, DESPERATELY PROTECTING ITS INNOCENCE BY </p><p>    REFUSING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS.  AMERICA AS A </p><p>    NATION IS SO BLINDED BY ARROGANCE IT FAILS TO </p><p>    RESPECT THAT WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF, BE </p><p>    IT RELIGION, WAY OF LIFE, SOCIAL OR POLITICAL </p><p>    SYSTEM. . .\'  IT HAS TO BE AMERICAN OR ELSE ITS </p><p>    NOTHING\' SEEMS TO BE THE SWEEPING FEELING HERE. </p><p>    IN ITS SELFISH AND RUTHLESS PURSUIT AND </p><p>    PROTECTION OF ITS INTERESTS, AMERICA HAS </p><p>    DESTROYED CULTURES, ENSLAVED OTHERS AND COMMITTED </p><p>    BIGOTRY.  AS A RESULT OF ITS THREE WEAKNESSES, </p><p>    THERE IS ALONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES AGAINST </p><p>    AMERICANS KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED BY MANY WHO HAVE </p><p>    STUDIED THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THIS OTHERWISE </p><p>    GREAT NATION.  GRIEVANCES LIKE AGGRESSIVE WESTERN </p><p>    EXPANSIONISM AND MANIPULATION OF COUNTRIES AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02771  01 OF 04  201404Z </p><p>    ECONOMIES ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE MOTIVE BEHIND </p><p>    THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS SYMBOL OF PROSPERITY AND </p><p>    FREEDOM, THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, AND ITS SYMBOL </p><p>    OF MILITARY PROWESS, THE PENTAGON. . .PERHAPS THE </p><p>    U. S. NEEDS TO REVISE SOME OF ITS STANCES, </p><p>    ATTITUDES AND POLICIES THAT SEEM TO MAKE MORE </p><p>    ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS.  THE U. S. NEEDS TO THINK </p><p>    ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ITS FREEDOM IS INFRINGING </p><p>    UPON AND DISRESPECTING OTHER PEOPLE\'S LIVES, </p><p>    RELIGIONS AND THEIR WORLD AS THEY KNOW AND WANT </p><p>    IT. . . WAGING A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM MAY REAP A </p><p>    VICTORY FOR THE U. S. AND ITS FREEDOM IDEALS. </p><p>    BUT SUCH A VICTORY, HOWEVER IMPORTANT </p><p></p></div>
