<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JAKARTA 001577 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 3/24/09 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ID, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  XANANA GUSMAO LETTER TO THE SECRETARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 47684, B) JAKARTA 1413 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE MICHAEL P. OWENS, REASON, 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. FOLLOWING IS A LETTER FROM EAST TIMORESE RESISTANCE </p><p>LEADER XANANA GUSMAO TO THE SECRETARY, IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE SECRETARY\'S LETTER OF MARCH 19 (REF A).  THE </p><p>ORIGINAL IS BEING FORWARDED BY POUCH: </p><p> </p><p>SALEMBA, MARCH 22, 1999 </p><p> </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT </p><p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE </p><p>2201 C STREET, NW </p><p>WASHINGTON, DC 20520 </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MADAME SECRETARY, </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER OF MARCH 19.  YOUR WORDS ARE </p><p>OF GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT AND CERTAINLY REINFORCE OUR </p><p>COMMITMENT FOR PEACE IN EAST TIMOR AS OUR HUMBLE </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO A STABLE AND PEACEFUL SOUTHEAST ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>I WILL RECALL OUR MEETING AS A MEMORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>SHARE A MOMENT OF FREEDOM WITH SOMEONE WHO SO CLEARLY </p><p>UNDERSTANDS ITS MEANING.  IT WAS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>VOICE THE YEARNINGS OF MY PEOPLE FOR PEACE AND </p><p>RECONCILIATION AND, ABOVE ALL, PEACE OF MIND TO SECURE </p><p>A FREE AND DIGNIFIED LIFE FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>I ALSO WISH TO EXPRESS OUR INTEREST IN STAYING IN CLOSE </p><p>AND REGULAR TOUCH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR J. STAPLETON ROY.  MY PERSONAL ASSISTANT, </p><p>MS. KIRSTY SWORD, WILL ENSURE THE CONTACT BETWEEN </p><p>THE US EMBASSY IN JAKARTA AND MY OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>REPORTS FROM EAST TIMOR ARE UNFORTUNATELY DEPICTING AN </p><p>ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS AN </p><p>INCREASE OF ARMED MILITIAS GROUPS (NAMELY IN LOSPALOS </p><p>AND SAME). </p><p> </p><p>THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS IS FACING NEW </p><p>SETBACKS AFTER THE EXPOSURE OF THE POLITICAL MANEUVERING </p><p>BY GOVERNOR ABILIO OSORIO SOARES AND MR. GIL ALVES, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF KLIBUR.  THE DOCUMENT, WHICH REVEALED THEIR </p><p>INSINCERE INTENTIONS IN THE RECONCILIATION DIALOGUE ALSO </p><p>PROVES ABRI (THE INDONESIAN MILITARY) AND DEPLU (THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS) BACK THEIR ACTION AND </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>THEY RECENTLYHELD A MEETING WITH A GROUP OF TEN </p><p>INDONESIAN GENERALS IN WHICH SEVEN STATED THEY WOULD </p><p>RESPECT A DECISION TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR </p><p>WHILE THREE, INCLUDING MR. ZACHY ANWAR (FORMER HEAD </p><p>OF BIA)(MILITARY INTELLIGENCE), SUPPORT THE ONGOING WAR </p><p>AGAINST DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>WE INSIST THAT THE TWO CATHOLIC BISHOPS, MONS. XIMENES </p><p>BELO AND MONS. BASILIO DO NASCIMENTO, LEAD THE PEACE AND </p><p>RECONCILIATION PROCESS.  NO ONE ELSE GATHERS SIMILAR </p><p>CONSENSUS, POLITICAL CREDIBILITY AND LEGITIMACY.  WE </p><p>ARE ALSO SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS CARRIED OUT BY KOMNASHAM </p><p>(THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION) TO FACILITATE </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EAST TIMORESE, TO SET UP A BROAD- </p><p>BASED PEACE AND STABILITY COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>WE SUPPORT THE TWO CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' STANCE ON </p><p>DEVELOPING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS IN DILI RATHER </p><p>THAN JAKARTA AND URGE THAT PRESSURE BE EXERTED UPON </p><p>JAKARTA TO ENABLE MY PRESENCE IN DILI TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN A FUTURE MEETING CONVENED BY THE BISHOPS. </p><p> </p><p>WE INSIST ON THE NEED TO DISARM AND DISBAND THE ARMED </p><p>MILITIA GROUPS.  WE ARE AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS </p><p>WILL RAISE GIVEN THE SPONSORSHIP AND SUPPORT GRANTED BY </p><p>JAKATA AND ABRI.  UNFORTUNATELY SUCH A SITUATION HAS </p><p>FORCED ME TO SHIFT MY CALL FOR A UN POLICE FORCE TO A </p><p>UN PEACE KEEPING FORCE.  THE ACTION CARRIED OUT BY THESE </p><p>GROUPS IS NOT WARFARE AGAINST AN ARMED COUNTERPART.  IT </p><p>IS COLD-BLOODED MURDER AGAINST DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE MALIANA KILLINGS TWO DAYS AGO, WHERE TWO </p><p>ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WERE SHOT. </p><p> </p><p>WE FULLY AGREE WITH AND HIGHLY APPRECIATE THE POINTS </p><p>YOU RAISED AS ON-GOING EFFORTS TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE TERRITORY.  WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO USE </p><p>THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE AND </p><p>ADMIRATION FOR YOUR WORDS AND SPEECH "INDONESIA, THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND DEMOCRACY," ADDRESSED IN JAKARTA </p><p>BEFORE LEAVING INDONESIA.  WE AGREE THAT ONLY AN </p><p>IMMEDIATE REDUCTION OF ABRI\'S PRESENCE IN EAST TIMOR </p><p>WILL ENABLE ITS FUTURE PARTICIPATION IN A UN PEACE </p><p>KEEPING FORCE AND THAT ONLY A DEMOCRATIC AND CREDIBLE </p><p>MECHANISM TO DETERMINE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WILL </p><p>LAST AND SUCCEED. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE CERTAIN THAT WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>COMMITMENT TO PEACE IN EAST TIMOR IT WILL BECOME A </p><p>REALITY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  WE PLEDGE OUR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THE FREEDOM OF EAST TIMOR AND THE BIRTH OF </p><p>OUR NEW NATION WILL BE YET ANOTHER FIRM STEP IN THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF PEACE AND COOPERATION IN THIS TROUBLED </p><p>REGION OF THE WORLD. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY </p><p>KAY RALA XANANA GUSMAO </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT: IN OUR VIEW, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN </p><p>XANANA\'S LETTER ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- AN INSISTENCE THAT THE TWO BISHOPS TAKE THE LEAD IN </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORTS (WHICH CONFIRMS EARLIER REPORTS - </p><p>REF B), AND HIS DESIRE TO ATTEND ANY RESULTING CHURCH- </p><p>SPONSORED FORUM IN EAST TIMOR. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIS REITERATION OF SUPPORT FOR KOMNASHAM\'S PROPOSED </p><p>PEACE AND STABILITY COUNCIL.  (OTHERS ON THE PRO- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE SIDE ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A </p><p>KOMNASHAM ROLE.) </p><p> </p><p>-- A CALL FOR A UN PEACEKEEPING FORCE.  XANANA </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HAD EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR A RELATIVELY </p><p>SMALL UN POLICE CONTINGENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIS CALL FOR A REDUCED ABRI PRESENCE.  UNLIKE SOME ON </p><p>THE PRO-INDEPENDENCE SIDE, XANANA STOPS SHORT OF </p><p>DEMANDING A TOTAL ABRI WITHDRAWAL BEFORE THE VOTING </p><p>PROCESS AND EVEN SUGGESTS THAT ABRI COULD BE PART OF A </p><p>"PEACEKEEPING FORCE." </p><p> </p><p>4.   XANANA\'S UNCHARACTERISTICALLY UNDIPLOMATIC DIATRIBE </p><p>AGAINST GOVERNOR ABILIO SOARES AND SOARES\' BROTHER-IN- </p><p>LAW GIL ALVES STEMS FROM HIS BELIEF THAT HE WAS DECEIVED </p><p>ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LATTER\'S "RECONCILIATION </p><p>DIALOGUE," WHICH WAS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE MARCH 19-20 IN </p><p>JAKARTA (REF B).  XANANA APPARENTLY HAD AGREED TO ATTEND </p><p>THE MEETING AFTER BEING GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS </p><p>WAS AN ATTEMPT TO START A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRO AND ANTI- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FORCES.  HE SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED THAT </p><p>SOARES AND ALVES, IN A FUNDING REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, HAD PORTRAYED THE FORUM\'S PURPOSE AS </p><p>PROMOTING THE AUTONOMY OPTION.  THERE CURRENTLY IS A </p><p>SEEMINGLY UNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PRO AND ANTI- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FORCES IN REGARD TO THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>"RECONCILIATION."  XANANA\'S SIDE SEES RECONCILIATION AS </p><p>CONVINCING THE PRO-INTEGRATION FORCES TO ACCOMMODATE </p><p>THEMSELVES TO THE REALITY OF INEVITABLE INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>WHILE THE PRO-INTEGRATIONISTS DEFINE IT AS LEADING TO A </p><p>COMPROMISE SOLUTION BETWEEN OUTRIGHT INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>THE STATUS QUO, I.E., AUTONOMY.  XANANA\'S CRITICISM OF </p><p>ZACHY ANWAR IS IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS INDICATIONS THAT </p><p>ZACHY (WHO HAS MET WITH XANANA ON AT LEAST TWO </p><p>OCCASIONS) HAD ESTABLISHED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>XANANA AND WAS PLAYING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>OWENS </p><p></p></div>
