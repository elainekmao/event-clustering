<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002883 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  A POLITICAL PARTY PRIMER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2202 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2862 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  INTRODUCTION:  With the registration of three new </p><p>political parties, the political landscape for Nigeria\'s </p><p>2003 election cycle now includes six political parties: </p><p>the ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), the Alliance </p><p>for Democracy (AD), the All Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP), </p><p>the National Democratic Party (NDP), the All People\'s Grand </p><p>Alliance (APGA), United Nigerian People\'s Party (UNPP).  By </p><p>definition, each party has a national character and exists </p><p>under guidelines that define how many offices they must </p><p>maintain throughout the country.  Given President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s perceived electoral weakness, it is too early to </p><p>predict what the scene may look like as elections approach, </p><p>but the following snapshot provides the current status of </p><p>each.  END INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The ruling PDP is blessed with some of the </p><p>strongest personalities in the country, including the </p><p>incumbent President Olusegun Obasanjo.  However, this </p><p>blessing is also its curse.  The PDP is formed from a core </p><p>group of supporters of the late Shehu Yar\'adua and led by </p><p>current Vice-president Atiku Abubakar, but the party is </p><p>augmented by numerous locally powerful politicians who </p><p>agreed to support the party in the previous round of </p><p>elections.  This marriage of convenience, while effective </p><p>in 1999, has grown strained.  There just are not enough </p><p>political "goods" for all the potentates in the party.  The </p><p>President embodies incumbency\'s advantages, but he has very </p><p>little personal support within the party.  Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar, on the other hand, is a highly proficient </p><p>politician who has spent his time building relationships at </p><p>home while his boss traveled the world.  The rift between </p><p>Obasanjo and Atiku (ref B) is almost public and probably </p><p>irreparable.  An outright public break between the two men </p><p>would weaken each and could cause many of the local </p><p>strongmen to flee to other parties with little risk to </p><p>their own local political futures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD) </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The AD, the second of the three parties, while </p><p>maintaining a presence nationwide, is a party of Southwest </p><p>Nigeria (Yorubaland).  As such, the AD remains active in </p><p>national politics, but has little hope of fielding a </p><p>presidential candidate.  For now, the AD appears content to </p><p>consolidate its hold on the Southwest while expanding into </p><p>neighboring areas where possible.  According to some party </p><p>leaders, the AD hopes to pick up a few Senate and House </p><p>seats in the South-South and the Middle Belt areas.  One </p><p>has said that the party would be competitive for statewide </p><p>offices in Kwara, Plateau and Benue states in the coming </p><p>elections.  The desire of the AD politicians is to maintain </p><p>a distinct Yoruba character while attracting some minority </p><p>support from these mixed regions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP) </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The ANPP changed its name from APP in anticipation </p><p>of a merger with the UNPP, which subsequently was aborted. </p><p>The ANPP has attracted a diverse list of supporters from </p><p>throughout the nation.  This makes for strange bedfellows. </p><p>One announced presidential candidate, former military </p><p>leader Mohammadu Buhari, appeals to the Northern masses but </p><p>is anathema to the ANPP\'s core backers, Northern elites. </p><p>It is making efforts to attract more support in the South- </p><p>South and Southeast in order to continue Northern influence </p><p>in Nigeria\'s political process.  Its prospects for gaining </p><p>the presidency depend largely on the travails of the PDP </p><p>and Obasanjo\'s decisions on self-succession. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National Democratic Party (NDP) </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The NDP was allegedly registered with the support </p><p>of former military leader Ibrahim Babangida (IBB).  The NDP </p><p>has a scattering of support among youth, particularly in </p><p>the North but will wield little influence in the upcoming </p><p>elections if it cannot attract a big name candidate.  The </p><p>clear preference of the party\'s leadership and grassroots </p><p>supporters is to convince IBB himself to become the party\'s </p><p>standard bearer.  But IBB\'s current intentions are unclear, </p><p>and he has other vehicles that might prove more roadworthy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All People\'s Grand Alliance (APGA) </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The APGA, also midwifed by IBB, has also met with </p><p>little success in attracting nationwide support.  Its hope </p><p>seems to be to evolve into the party of choice for the Igbo </p><p>community of the Southeast.  While it has had some success </p><p>in attracting Igbo politicians, the Igbo themselves are </p><p>split on what their role should be in the elections and </p><p>what strategy to pursue.  Some are content to play second </p><p>fiddle to a Northern standard-bearer while others argue </p><p>that the time has come for the Igbo to present a serious </p><p>Presidential candidate of their own.  If the APGA can help </p><p>consolidate Igbo views, it might evolve into a Southeastern </p><p>version of the AD and become the powerbroker for the </p><p>Southeast.  If not, the party may wither on the vine. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>United Nigerian People\'s Party (UNPP) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The UNPP, the third party reportedly formed with </p><p>IBB\'s support, has since turned on its reported benefactor </p><p>over alleged broken promises.  While enjoying some success </p><p>in gaining supporters outside the North, it has not been </p><p>able to position itself as an alternative to the original </p><p>three parties and appears in no danger of doing so soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  While the political situation remains </p><p>very fluid, some lines are discernible.  The PDP and the </p><p>ANPP remain the two parties to beat in national elections, </p><p>with the AD solid in its home base.  If the PDP cannot </p><p>resolve its internal differences, its strongest supporters </p><p>will have no reason to remain loyal and can jump to one of </p><p>the other parties with relative impunity.  The ANPP is </p><p>best-positioned to capitalize on the disarray within the </p><p>ruling party and hopes to pick up significant support in </p><p>the upcoming weeks as succession issues are being sorted </p><p>out.  As always, personalities matter more than parties in </p><p>the crunch of an election campaign.  Until fence-sitters </p><p>and aisle-crossers settle down, it will remain impossible </p><p>to estimate how the parties will fare in legislative and </p><p>gubernatorial elections. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
