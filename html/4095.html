<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT IN AMMAN 10/28: </p><p>SITREP 2 </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6261 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) NIACT PRECEDENCE REQUIRED BECAUSE OF URGENCY OF </p><p>INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) At approximately 1045 local time, the Ambassador </p><p>spoke with GID Director Sa\'ad Kheir regarding the shooting of </p><p>USAID employee Larry Foley.  Director Kheir  conveyed his </p><p>condolences and said that the GOJ (GID and PSD) were </p><p>immediately implementing a new heightened security plan to </p><p>protect U.S. interests in the Kingdom.  Kheir said that he </p><p>had already spoken with PSD Commander Tahsin Shurdom and the </p><p>plan would include putting both additional uniformed PSD and </p><p>plainclothed GID personnel at all sites frequented by </p><p>Americans (including the school and all U.S. Embassy </p><p>residences).  Kheir noted, however, that while the GOJ will </p><p>do all it can to protect Americans in Jordan, Embassy staff </p><p>will have to take steps to protect themselves as well (such </p><p>as varying routes and times, etc.). </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Kheir said that while the GID had taken strong </p><p>measures to prevent such an incident, the situation in Jordan </p><p>is difficult and "things will not be as quiet as they seem." </p><p>He said there was a strong possibility that other outrages </p><p>could occur.  He said the GID is running all its traplines on </p><p>suspect organizations and individuals in Jordan and expressed </p><p>confidence that the GID would be able to identify and </p><p>apprehend the assailant, whatever his affiliations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Shortly after the Ambassador\'s conversation with </p><p>Kheir, King Abdullah called the Ambassador both to express </p><p>his condolences and also to indicate that he would not </p><p>hesitate to use every resource available to protect the </p><p>American community and find the assailant. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
