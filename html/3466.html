<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>MANILA FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoist Students Bomb Kathmandu School, Injuring </p><p>Six </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) Kathmandu 1315, B) Kathmandu 481 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Students shouting Maoist slogans set </p><p>off a bomb at a private business college in Kathmandu </p><p>August 8, injuring six.  The school occupies a building </p><p>owned by the King\'s Press Secretary, who lives next door </p><p>and was not harmed.  The motive for the attack is unclear </p><p>as no large-scale Maoist strikes or actions have been </p><p>announced for the coming days.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bomb at Business College Injures Six </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) A bomb exploded at a private school in the </p><p>Maitidevi area of central Kathmandu early on August 8, </p><p>police sources confirmed.  Six people were injured, </p><p>including three passers-by, and one victim remains in </p><p>critical condition.  Between 6:45 and 7:00 a.m., a group </p><p>of six youths chanting Maoist slogans entered the "College </p><p>of Applied Business," told everyone to leave, and set off </p><p>a bomb outside the door to the principal\'s office.  [Note: </p><p>No/no American students are enrolled at the school, which </p><p>is located about five kilometers southeast of the Embassy. </p><p>No/no Embassy residences are located nearby.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Similar to Last Blast </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Witnesses told Embassy staff that the explosion </p><p>was similar in effect to a July 5 blast at Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s party office (Ref A).  After an </p><p>investigation that tied the July 5 explosion to Maoist </p><p>insurgents, police reportedly arrested one man and </p><p>confiscated explosive materials from his residence. </p><p> </p><p>Students Object to Fees, Sanskrit </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Another school in Kathmandu\'s Maitidevi </p><p>neighborhood was attacked March 1, when gangs of students </p><p>raided two different schools in the capital, dousing </p><p>equipment with kerosene and setting fires.  These attacks </p><p>were intended to terrorize the public into following a </p><p>"school strike" they had called for March 4-5 (Ref B).  In </p><p>recent years, Maoist-affiliated student groups have </p><p>attacked and vandalized schools throughout the country. </p><p>In addition, they have issued calls protesting "fees" </p><p>charged to public school students and demanding reductions </p><p>in tuition.  The Maoists also have also made known their </p><p>opposition to the teaching of Sanskrit, which they </p><p>identify with reactionary Hinduism. </p><p> </p><p>Building Owned by Palace Official </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The building bombed on August 8 is owned by the </p><p>Press Secretary at Nepal\'s Royal Palace, Mohan Bahadur </p><p>Pandey, who leases it to the school.  Pandey\'s own </p><p>residence is adjacent to the affected building.  He was </p><p>reportedly at home at the time of the blast, but was </p><p>unharmed.  In conversations with us, both journalists and </p><p>police officers voiced speculation that the Maoists </p><p>intentionally attacked property owned by a palace official </p><p>to make a "symbolic" gesture. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Initial reports suggest that the August 8 </p><p>explosion was the work of the same people who bombed the </p><p>PM\'s party office July 5.  It also fits a pattern of </p><p>agitation by student groups either affiliated with or </p><p>sympathetic to the Maoist insurgents.  However, unlike the </p><p>March 1 incidents, which were meant to enforce a school </p><p>strike, the August 8 attack does not seem connected to any </p><p>impending Maoist action.  A general strike called for </p><p>September 16 is still more than five weeks away.  Given </p><p>the pattern of previous attacks against schools in the </p><p>neighborhood, Post judges that the palace official\'s </p><p>ownership of the property was merely coincidental. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
