<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  MORE PROTESTS OVER IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. HANOI 396  B. HCMC 157  C. USUN 413 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On February 19, the national Youth Federation and </p><p>the Hanoi Youth Federation jointly sponsored a rally at the </p><p>Hanoi Medical University opposing war in Iraq and expressing </p><p>solidarity with the people of Iraq.  According to press </p><p>reports, more than 1,000 students and young people from a </p><p>variety of institutions took part (although press photos </p><p>indicated a hefty component of middle aged or older </p><p>participants at least in the front rows).   The rally, like </p><p>similar ones in Hue and Ho Chi Minh City also on February </p><p>19, received prominent media coverage.  The Vietnam Lawyers </p><p>Association separately expressed support for a political </p><p>solution to the Iraq issue in conformity with the UN Charter </p><p>and international law. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The youth meeting in Hanoi passed a resolution </p><p>proclaiming that "Vietnamese youth oppose war against Iraq" </p><p>and calling on people around the world to make every effort </p><p>to "protect peace."  Participants also insisted the "US and </p><p>U.K. stop military action against Iraq" and "respect the </p><p>independence and sovereignty" of Iraq.   One speaker </p><p>denounced the "military pressure" of "US authorities" on </p><p>Iraq and threats to "world peace and stability." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Vietnamese media also gave prominent coverage to </p><p>pro-inspections, anti-war comments by the Vietnamese deputy </p><p>permanent representative to the United Nations at the </p><p>Security Council on February 18 (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Comment:  The language used at this "mass" rally was </p><p>almost identical to expressions from similarly organized </p><p>demonstrations on February 18 (refs a and b), further </p><p>indicating the centrally-directed nature of the "protests" </p><p>and the likelihood that other mass organizations will follow </p><p>suit in the coming days.  Embassy\'s requests to meet with </p><p>student unions in Hanoi have been politely rebuffed by the </p><p>central Youth Federation since October 2002.  It is another </p><p>telling indicator of the Leninist top-down nature of this </p><p>system that the leaders of the national Youth Federation are </p><p>in the 30s and 40s, and the leaders of most university </p><p>student unions appear to be 20ish lecturers rather than </p><p>actual students. </p><p>BURGUARDT </p><p></p></div>
