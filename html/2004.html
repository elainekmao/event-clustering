<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002396 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NITEL PRIVATIZATION DELAYED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  The GON recently announced a two-month delay in </p><p>the privatization of Nigerian Telecommunications, Ltd. </p><p>(NITEL) originally scheduled for September 2001.  According </p><p>to BPE Advisor Michael Dan, NITEL\'s privatization would more </p><p>likely be delayed until February-March 2002 and may not </p><p>attract top-notch international telecommunications companies </p><p>due to an uncertain regulatory environment.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. In August, press reports revealed that the GON had decided </p><p>to extend the period for interested companies to conduct due </p><p>diligence on NITEL\'s accounts.  As a result of the extension, </p><p>the Bureau of Public Enterprises (GON privatization agency) </p><p>released a statement that the GON would not choose an </p><p>investor until early November.  On September 12, Econoff met </p><p>with Michael Dan, who heads a five-person team of </p><p>USAID-sponsored advisors to the Bureau of Public Enterprises </p><p>(BPE) to discuss the delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The extension, according to Dan, was granted because the </p><p>information memorandum for investors was not ready.  This </p><p>memo is to provide interested buyers with information on </p><p>NITEL\'s accounts and other sale details.  Although the </p><p>memorandum has now been sent to prospective investors, the </p><p>audits of NITEL accounts are not finished.  Specifically, </p><p>account information regarding receivables and pensions may </p><p>not be accurate, said Dan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Dan insisted that these delays were technical and did not </p><p>reflect a lack of political will to proceed with the </p><p>privatization.  He asserted that the original schedule had </p><p>been much too ambitious, commenting that "Nigerian officials </p><p>would argue that the current timetable of November is still </p><p>very accelerated."  In fact, Dan suggested that the November </p><p>timeframe was not realistic either; "the privatization will </p><p>not occur until February-March 2002," he said.  Once the </p><p>buyer is identified, negotiations between the buyer and the </p><p>GON regarding telecommunications regulations would ensue. </p><p>Dan commented that these negotiations could stretch on for </p><p>months due to Nigeria\'s uncertain regulatory environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The regulatory structure for the telecommunications </p><p>industry is in flux; a draft telecommunications bill is </p><p>before the National Assembly and, therefore, subject to </p><p>change.  Dan argued that the uncertain environment generated </p><p>by the absence of a clear regulatory structure would make the </p><p>negotiations between the GON and the buyer difficult; even a </p><p>one Naira change in the maximum local telephone rate would </p><p>have a major impact on the buyer\'s offer terms.  Moreover, </p><p>Dan pointed out, once the GON had divested itself of NITEL, </p><p>its only interest in telecommunications would be to keep </p><p>prices low. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Dan asserted that these uncertainties would likely </p><p>dissuade first class international telecommunications </p><p>companies from bidding on NITEL.  He anticipated that NITEL\'s </p><p>sale price would end up much lower than the GON expected.  He </p><p>also hypothesized that the buyer would likely be an insider </p><p>who has been able to obtain assurances that the </p><p>telecommunications bill would be favorable to their </p><p>interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment.  The GON has established an extremely ambitious </p><p>privatization schedule in order to satisfy pressures from the </p><p>IMF and international donor community.  Consequently, delays </p><p>in the schedule are likely to occur frequently.  Moreover, if </p><p>the IMF decides not to extend its program in Nigeria, the GON </p><p>would likely lessen its focus on the privatization program in </p><p>general.  End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
