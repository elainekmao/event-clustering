<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/PGI, EUR/SE, EUR/ACE, OES/PCI, OES/IHA </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA (BFREEMAN, APHILLIPS, HHUYNH) and NSF </p><p>POSTS FOR ESTOFF, HUB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ENVIRONMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS, JAN. - FEB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 8870 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This is one of a series of cables providing updates on </p><p>environmental issues in Turkey.  Below are topics covered in </p><p>this cable: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Proposed environmental law withdrawn </p><p>2. WSSD Follow-up </p><p>3. Euros 126 million for accession preparation </p><p>4. Law on membership goes into effect </p><p>5. REC plans for Turkey move forward </p><p>6. Municipal recycling postponed </p><p>7. Possible source of Hepatitis B and C in Ankara </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. MINISTER PROPOSES THEN WITHDRAWS DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. </p><p>New Environment Minister Imdat Sutulogul forwarded proposed </p><p>environmental legislation to Parliament, and then withdrew </p><p>it about a month later.  The proposed law was designed to </p><p>strengthen the traditionally weak Ministry by assigning it </p><p>new authorities and financing, and resolving conflicting </p><p>responsibilities with other agencies.  It appeared to have </p><p>included a 10 percent fee for plastic bottles that would </p><p>have troubled soft-drink bottlers, such as Coca-Cola and and </p><p>Pepsi-Cola.  The legislation would have been the first major </p><p>revision in environmental law since 1997. Post will follow </p><p>developments and report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. WSSD FOLLOW-UP.  A consultant to the Ministry of </p><p>Environment (MOE) is pouring through WSSD documents to </p><p>compare the commitments that Turkey made at WSSD with </p><p>Turkey\'s laws, EU directives, State Planning Office (SPO) </p><p>policies, MOE programs and other national regulations. </p><p>Turkey will continue to seek WSSD partnerships between now </p><p>and the completion of the lengthy tome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. EURO 126 MILLION FOR ACCESSION PREPARATION. The European </p><p>Commission has approved Euro 126-million for a pre-accession </p><p>financial assistance program to assist Turkey in preparing </p><p>for EU membership. One of the five key areas to be studied </p><p>will address strengthening public administration to improve </p><p>phytosanitary and veterinary controls, maritime safety, and </p><p>environmental inspection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. LAW ON MEMBERSHIP GOES INTO EFFECT. The law addressing </p><p>Turkey\'s joining the European Environment Agency and </p><p>participating in the European Environment Information and </p><p>Observation Network entered into force on January 28. As a </p><p>part of its membership obligation, Turkey will pay dues of </p><p>Euro 2,033,000 (USD 2.2 million) the first year, of which </p><p>MEDA (European-Mediterranean Partnership) will pay Euro </p><p>1,524,750 (USD 1.65 million).  The fee increases and MEDA </p><p>contribution decreases the second year.  By the third year, </p><p>Turkey will bear the full membership fee -- Euro 3,127,000 </p><p>(USD 3.3 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. REC TURKEY MOVES FORWARD.  Representatives from REC </p><p>Budapest confirm that plans for REC Turkey are proceeding on </p><p>schedule.  REC Budapest\'s Deputy Executive Director </p><p>reiterated that ratification of the REC Turkey Charter by </p><p>the Turkish Parliament is expected within two months.  REC </p><p>Budapest anticipates that the required bilateral agreement </p><p>will be signed and ratified by June so the REC could begin </p><p>operation that month with allotted EU funding.  There is </p><p>still no agreement on legal status (association, foundation, </p><p>special designation) for the REC.  A donors meeting would be </p><p>held after opening the office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. MUNICIPAL RECYCLING POSTPONED. The Ministry of </p><p>Environment (MOE) is still seeking to engage the Ankara </p><p>Metropolitan Municipality in its proposed national recycling </p><p>program. Although the draft agreement between MOE and the </p><p>municipality was completed in August, the municipality has </p><p>yet to sign.  On a related note, Ankara recently began a USD </p><p>270 million solid waste project in cooperation with a Swiss </p><p>company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. POSSIBLE SOURCE OF HEPATITIS B AND C IN ANKARA. A press </p><p>release from the Ankara Governate advised that local </p><p>governing bodies have prohibited the use of waters from the </p><p>Ankara Stream for irrigation purposes due to recent </p><p>outbreaks of Hepatitis B and C among some who use those </p><p>waters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
