<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: INCREASING NUMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL SEEKING </p><p>TO RETURN TO BAGHDAD FROM JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 114629 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Over the past week, Embassy Amman, Task Force West, </p><p>units deployed in Iraq, and CENTCOM HQ have worked jointly to </p><p>facilitate the movement of several foreign diplomatic convoys </p><p>into Baghdad from Amman, following requests from those </p><p>diplomatic missions (see list para 3) asking for guidance </p><p>and/or assistance with such travel.  Our standard response </p><p>has been that the U.S. military has declared the </p><p>Amman-Baghdad Highway to be permissive, although random acts </p><p>of banditry have occurred and coalition forces are not in a </p><p>position to provide escorts to diplomatic convoys.  We have </p><p>noted that in Baghdad security is less firm, that the </p><p>coalition is unable to provide security for specific </p><p>diplomatic properties, and diplomats going there must assume </p><p>a certain amount of risk. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Despite our efforts to discourage them, all the </p><p>diplomatic convoys that intended to travel did so -- </p><p>apparently as a result of decisions made in capitals.  In </p><p>each case, we (through Task Force West and CENTCOM HQ) passed </p><p>on all the particulars we received to U.S. military units </p><p>forward-deployed in western Iraq.  The foreign diplomats who </p><p>have returned have done so for two stated purposes: (1) to </p><p>check on the status of their diplomatic property in Baghdad </p><p>and (2) to re-open their missions and/or provide consular </p><p>services  to their nationals in Iraq.  Common questions that </p><p>have arisen include:  (a) Whether the U.S. military would </p><p>provide any protection to their personnel either en route to </p><p>or in Baghdad; and (b) who/what is the appropriate point of </p><p>contact for them in Baghdad when they arrive.  We will convey </p><p>information contained in reftel with missions that contact us </p><p>from this point forward regarding prospective travel to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) To date, diplomats from the following countries have </p><p>traveled to Baghdad from Amman, or intend to do so shortly: </p><p>Jordan, Spain, Vietnam, Thailand, People\'s Republic of China, </p><p>Japan, Germany, Korea, Singapore, and Nigeria.  In addition, </p><p>the Dutch mission here asked if the coalition could provide </p><p>transport into Baghdad for one Dutch diplomat who is </p><p>recovering from a compound leg fracture and cannot make the </p><p>difficult 12-hour drive from Amman. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Since the decisions to reopen missions to </p><p>Iraq are made in capitals, we have been unable to dissuade </p><p>any diplomatic travelers from going to Baghdad.  We would </p><p>appreciate clarification of reftel indication that coalition </p><p>forces on the Jordan-Iraq border will in future prevent </p><p>foreign diplomats from entering Iraq without prior </p><p>authorization.  If this is the case, we would appreciate an </p><p>explanation of the approval process (including initial points </p><p>of contact) so we can explain it to would-be travelers in </p><p>Amman. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
