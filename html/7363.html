<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002368 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE: ILL </p><p>INFORMED AND SO FAR INEFFECTIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2353 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1423 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The parliamentary Human Rights Committee does </p><p>not play a significant role in the development of reform </p><p>legislation, and the public comments of its Chairman to date </p><p>have focused on supposed human rights violations outside </p><p>Turkey.  Committee members are generally not well informed on </p><p>Turkish human rights issues and lack specific ideas for </p><p>promoting reform.  Some hold extreme Islamist and </p><p>anti-American/xenophobic views.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOT over the past couple of years has adopted </p><p>several extensive, bold packages of human rights reform </p><p>legislation as part of its drive for EU membership.  The </p><p>ruling AK Party has continued this effort since coming to </p><p>power in the November elections.  However, the parliamentary </p><p>Human Rights Committee plays virtually no role in this </p><p>process.  Our  meetings with 13 of 25 Committee members </p><p>indicate that the Committee is ill-prepared to promote human </p><p>rights in Turkey.  Here\'s why: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Turkish Parliamentarians Are Not Lawmakers </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Committee played virtually no role in drafting or </p><p>revising any of the human rights reform packages adopted by </p><p>Parliament over the past two years.  The drafts were prepared </p><p>by MFA officials in consultation with other ministries, </p><p>particularly the Justice and Interior ministries.  The </p><p>parliamentary Constitutional and Justice committees made some </p><p>revisions to the drafts, but Human Rights Committee members </p><p>acknowledge they did not.  Turkish MPs have the right to </p><p>introduce legislation, but traditionally the bureaucracy </p><p>drafts most bills.  Human Rights Committee members do not </p><p>appear to have any knowledge of or interest in the </p><p>legislative process; none of the members with whom we spoke </p><p>has plans to introduce legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Ineffective Leadership </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While the Committee\'s lack of influence over </p><p>legislation is nothing new, the Committee has in the past </p><p>served as an effective soap box for promoting human rights </p><p>reform.  In 2000, Committee Chairwoman Sema Piskinsut </p><p>released a series of highly critical reports documenting </p><p>torture in prisons and detention centers throughout Turkey. </p><p>Prosecutors sought to have her parliamentary immunity removed </p><p>in order to prosecute her for refusing to release the names </p><p>of her sources.  However, current Chairman Mehmet Elkatmis </p><p>has so far focused on calling attention to supposed human </p><p>rights problems outside Turkey.  In his comments to the </p><p>press, Elkatmis has: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Accused the U.S. and UK of committing "savagery" and a </p><p>"massacre" in Iraq and suggested leaders of the two countries </p><p>could be tried on war crimes (reftel A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Criticized the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Promised to investigate allegations of unspecified ill </p><p>treatment of a Turkish prisoner in Sweden.  (Note: A Swedish </p><p>diplomat told us the GOT has not responded to Sweden\'s offer </p><p>to transfer him to a Turkish prison.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Promised to investigate allegations in the Turkish press </p><p>that the German Government is conducting medical experiments </p><p>on Turkish prisoners.  (Note: German diplomats say these </p><p>allegations appear to be fueled by recent suicides among </p><p>Turkish prisoners in Germany, as well as the fact that asylum </p><p>seekers in Germany are required to take a medical exam.  One </p><p>Committee member told us there were "rumors" that the USG was </p><p>using Guantanamo Bay prisoners for medical experiments.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We have not seen Elkatmis make public statements </p><p>calling attention to human rights abuses in Turkey.  Elkatmis </p><p>denied to us that he is focusing on problems outside Turkey, </p><p>noting that the Committee recently visited southeastern </p><p>Turkey and will soon release its report on conditions there. </p><p>We have not yet seen the report, but Elkatmis told us it </p><p>reflects his conclusion that it is now "impossible" to commit </p><p>torture in detention centers because cameras have been </p><p>installed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Committee\'s two vice chairmen do not compensate </p><p>for Elkatmis\' shortcomings.  Cavit Torun, an AK member, holds </p><p>the most extreme Islamist and anti-Western views of the </p><p>Committee members we\'ve met to date.  During our meeting, </p><p>Torun accused the USG of supporting the PKK and launched an </p><p>anti-American diatribe, deflecting all attempts to address </p><p>human rights in Turkey.  Mehmet Serif Ertugrul, of the </p><p>opposition CHP party, is better informed, but offered no </p><p>specific ideas about how the Committee should operate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>No Focus or Sense of Mission </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Many members view the Committee as an NGO-like body </p><p>whose role is to serve as the nation\'s moral conscience, </p><p>rather than an element of the government responsible for </p><p>making specific contributions to human rights reform in </p><p>Turkey.  Several averred to us that Committee members are not </p><p>GOT representatives, but rather advocates of human rights </p><p>worldwide.  Some of the AK members are only capable of </p><p>discussing human rights in broad Koranic terms addressing the </p><p>need for brotherhood among men.  They appear to have no </p><p>interest in day-to-day human rights matters in Turkey -- one </p><p>told us he had never heard of the highly publicized case </p><p>against five German democracy foundations (Reftel B), while </p><p>another was unaware of an incident involving police beating a </p><p>protestor in Ankara on live TV. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Fear of Outsiders </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Some of our Committee interlocutors display the most </p><p>extreme symptoms of the classic Turkish fear of all things </p><p>foreign.  This is particularly problematic in the human </p><p>rights field, where Turkey needs to engage the EU, U.S., and </p><p>others in order to progress.  Two Committee MPs told us they </p><p>reject the Western human rights model, only to retreat when </p><p>asked whether they support Turkey\'s EU candidacy (both said </p><p>yes).  Other views expressed by members include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Peace Corps volunteers who served in Turkey until the </p><p>early 1970\'s wanted to learn about all elements of Turkish </p><p>culture only in order to find weak points to exploit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S. turned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan over to Turkey </p><p>not for Turkey\'s benefit, but only to spare its allies Italy </p><p>and Greece the embarrassment of having him on their hands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Western powers forced Turkey to spend money on the </p><p>military during the Cold War in order to protect themselves </p><p>and prevent Turkey from developing economically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We will continue to engage Committee members in an </p><p>effort to encourage a more constructive, focused approach to </p><p>human rights issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
