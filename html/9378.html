(SBU) Summary:  In his farewell call on Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Sener on July 10, the Ambassador encouraged the GOT </p><p>to stick with the economic reform program, emphasizing anti- </p><p>corruption and other measures which would help boost foreign </p><p>direct investment.  The Ambassador also highlighted the </p><p>negative effect of the ongoing Motorola dispute on investor </p><p>sentiment toward Turkey.  Sener reaffirmed Turkey\'s </p><p>commitment to the reform program and to efforts to improve </p><p>the investment environment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic overview </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) DPM Sener acknowledged some negative economic </p><p>developments, including a recent increase in interest rates. </p><p>The strength of the lira has not thus far negatively </p><p>impacted foreign trade, but a continued strong lira could </p><p>prompt concern in the markets if it causes the current </p><p>account deficit to increase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Sener reaffirmed Turkey\'s commitment to the IMF </p><p>program, while admitting to problems and delays in </p><p>implementation.    He continued that the delay in the fifth </p><p>review was a mistake, partially attributable to parliament\'s </p><p>internal regulations, which delayed consideration of some </p><p>draft legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Investment Climate </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Ambassador mentioned that Motorola officials </p><p>were in Ankara to meet GOT officials on their pending </p><p>receivables from Telsim, owned by the Uzan family.   He </p><p>emphasized that a positive resolution of this case would </p><p>improve investor sentiment toward Turkey and reinforce the </p><p>GOT\'s commitment to the rule of law.  Sener responded the </p><p>Uzans have been in conflict not only with other companies, </p><p>but also with Turkish state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Ambassador urged Sener to undertake anti- </p><p>corruption activities and other measures to enhance the </p><p>investment environment for domestic and foreign companies </p><p>alike.  He pointed out that Turkey is attracting as little </p><p>as 10 percent of its foreign direct investment potential, </p><p>despite an educated and hard-working labor force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Sener responded that combating corruption was </p><p>important to gaining the trust of the citizenry, which would </p><p>in turn help efforts to improve tax compliance.  He also </p><p>said that the GOT Coordination Board to Improve the </p><p>Investment Climate Environment, headed by State Minister </p><p>Babacan, was working to cut bureaucratic hurdles for the </p><p>private sector and to provide a secure legal environment and </p><p>economic stability. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
