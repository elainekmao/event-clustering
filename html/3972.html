(SBU)  SUMMARY.  NONG DUC MANH, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV), VISITED JAPAN OCTOBER 2-5. </p><p>BOTH SIDES PREDICTABLY LABELED THE CAREFULLY SCRIPTED VISIT </p><p>AS A "SUCCESS."  IN ADDITION TO "REAFFIRMING THE STRONG </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP," TOPICS INCLUDED THE NEED FOR </p><p>VIETNAM TO MAKE JAPAN\'S OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE </p><p>(ODA) "MORE EFFICIENT," BEEFING UP NEGOTIATIONS FOR A </p><p>"SPEEDY CONCLUSION" OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT </p><p>PROTECTION AND PROMOTION, AND POSSIBLE RELIEF OF IMPORT </p><p>RESTRICTIONS OF JAPANESE MOTORBIKE KITS.  JAPAN PUSHED FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR </p><p>TEST BAN TREATY.  BOTH SIDES REITERATED A COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ERADICATE TERRORISM.  MANH INVITED THE EMPEROR TO VISIT </p><p>VIETNAM, BUT SUCH A VISIT IS UNLIKELY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THIS WAS MANH\'S FIRST VISIT TO JAPAN SINCE BECOMING </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY IN APRIL 2001, ALTHOUGH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>VISITED JAPAN IN 1995 AS THEN-NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN. </p><p>THEN-CPV GENERAL SECRETARY DO MUOI AND THEN-PRIME MINISTER </p><p>VO VAN KIET VISITED IN 1995 AND 1993, RESPECTIVELY. </p><p>OFFICIALS ACCOMPANYING MANH INCLUDED DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>VU KHOAN, FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN, SEVERAL HIGH </p><p>RANKING CPV OFFICIALS, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT </p><p>VO HONG PHUC, AND MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING NGUYEN </p><p>MINH HIEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  MANH SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN TOKYO, BUT ALSO </p><p>VISITED OSAKA, WHICH HAS CLOSE TIES TO HO CHI MINH CITY.  HE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02493  01 OF 02  150723Z </p><p>RETURNED TO VIETNAM DIRECTLY FROM OSAKA.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>NGUYEN VINH QUANG, VICE DIRECTOR OF THE CPV CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE COMMISSION FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS\' DEPARTMENT FOR </p><p>CHINA AND NORTHEAST ASIA, MANH HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH JAPANESE </p><p>EMPEROR AKIHITO, AND MET WITH PRIME MINISTER KOIZUMI AND </p><p>NUMEROUS HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS FROM JAPANESE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES AND THE LEGISLATURE.  IN ADDITION, MANH HAD MEETINGS </p><p>WITH THE JAPAN UNION OF ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS AND THE JAPAN- </p><p>VIETNAM FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION, AND PAID A VISIT TO A </p><p>UNIVERSITY.  QUANG SAID THAT MANH DID NOT COME INTO CONTACT </p><p>WITH STUDENTS DURING THE UNIVERSITY VISIT.  JAPANESE EMBOFFS </p><p>NOTED SEPARATELY THAT MANH MADE PRO FORMA CALLS ON THE HEADS </p><p>OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>JAPANESE COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ODA:  DO MORE WITH LESS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  DURING HIS MEETING WITH KOIZUMI, MANH REITERATED </p><p>THE NEED FOR JAPAN TO CONTINUE ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF ODA. </p><p>JAPAN IS VIETNAM\'S LARGEST ODA DONOR; FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL </p><p>YEAR, IT HAS PLEDGED NEARLY USD 739 MILLION, ACCORDING TO </p><p>PRESS REPORTS.  (NOTE:  WHILE JAPAN IS CUTTING ITS ODA BY </p><p>ABOUT 10 PCT WORLDWIDE THIS YEAR, VIETNAM LEVELS REMAINED </p><p>STEADY, WHICH MADE JAPAN THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUR AT LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF DONORS MEETING IN HANOI.  END </p><p>NOTE)  JAPAN REPRESENTS ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S TOTAL </p><p>ODA, ALTHOUGH A WHOPPING 85 PCT OF THAT IS TIED AID. </p><p>JAPANESE EMBOFFS SAID THAT, WHILE KOIZUMI AND MANH DID NOT </p><p>DISCUSS SPECIFIC NUMBERS, THE VIETNAMESE SIDE RECOGNIZED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02493  01 OF 02  150723Z </p><p>THAT THE GVN WILL LIKELY HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS. DURING </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AND IN THE FINAL COMMUNIQU, BOTH SIDES </p><p>SPECIFICALLY AGREED FOR THE NEED FOR VIETNAM TO USE JAPAN\'S </p><p>ODA MORE "EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY, GIVEN THE CURRENT </p><p>BUDGETARY SITUATION." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>INVESTMENT PROTECTION AND PROMOTION:  LET\'S GET IT DONE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE CPV\'S QUANG SAID THAT BOTH SIDES ARE "ANXIOUS" </p><p>TO COMPLETE WORK ON THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN </p><p>NEGOTIATING SINCE 1999.  HE PREDICTED THAT "CHANCES ARE </p><p>GOOD" IT WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  QUANG </p><p>ADMITTED THAT JAPANESE BUSINESSES WANT TO SEE MORE OPEN </p><p>MARKETS IN VIETNAM, AND ADDED THAT THE AGREEMENT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE VIETNAM\'S COMMITMENT TO ATTRACTING </p><p>MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT NOT ONLY FROM JAPAN BUT ALSO OTHER </p><p>FOREIGN SOURCES.  ACCORDING TO QUANG, MANH AGREED WITH HIS </p><p>HOSTS ON THE NEED TO ACCELERATE NEGOTIATIONS AND COMPLETE </p><p>THE AGREEMENT.  (COMMENT:  TALKS ON THIS AGREEMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>LANGUISHING UNTIL THE US-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>WENT INTO EFFECT IN DECEMBER 2001.  SINCE THEN, JAPAN HAS </p><p>APPARENTLY FELT A RENEWED URGENCY, WHILE VIETNAM HAD FEWER </p><p>EXCUSES FOR DELAYING THE TALKS.  EMBASSY UNDERSTANDS THAT </p><p>JAPAN IS PUSHING FOR A BTA-PLUS AGREEMENT, WHILE VIETNAM IS </p><p>HOLDING OUT FOR BTA-MINUS.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME SPECULATION </p><p>THAT THE RECENT MOTORBIKE DISPUTE MAY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0941 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02493  02 OF 02  150724Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   A-00     CA-01    CCO-00   CEA-01 </p><p>      CG-00    CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NRCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OCS-03   OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PER-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  USSS-00  ASDS-01  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------F72AE4  150724Z /38 </p><p>R 150716Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7787 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002493 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/J </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02493  02 OF 02  150724Z </p><p>SUBJ: NONG DUC MANH VISITS JAPAN: ACCORDING TO SCRIPT </p><p> </p><p>PUTTING PRESSURE ON JAPAN DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MOTORBIKES:  WE\'RE HURTING </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  JUST PRIOR TO MANH\'S VISIT, THE GVN ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>IT WAS DRASTICALLY CUTTING THE AGREED QUOTA FOR THE IMPORT </p><p>OF "KNOCKDOWN KITS" FOR JAPANESE MOTORCYCLE MAKERS.  HONDA </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.  AUTHORITIES IN VINH PHUC </p><p>PROVINCE, WHERE THE FACTORY IS LOCATED, HAD AUTHORIZED AN </p><p>ANNUAL IMPORT QUOTA OF 587,000 KITS, BUT CENTRAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>CUT THAT TO 280,000 KITS.  SINCE HONDA HAD ALREADY EXCEEDED </p><p>THAT NUMBER, IT WILL BE FORCED TO CEASE PRODUCTION FOR THE </p><p>REST OF THE YEAR.  QUOTAS FOR YAMAHA AND SUZUKI WERE ALSO </p><p>CUT, AND PRODUCTION AT THOSE FACILITIES HAS SLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  ON THE MARGINS OF MANH\'S TALKS WITH THE GOJ, SENIOR </p><p>EXECUTIVES FROM HONDA, SUZUKI, AND YAMAHA MET SEPARATELY </p><p>WITH DPM (AND FORMER TRADE MINISTER) VU KHOAN CONCERNING </p><p>THESE RECENT VIETNAMESE LIMITATIONS.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUE TO THE GOJ, ACCORDING TO JAPANESE EMBOFFS. </p><p>JAPANESE INTERLOCUTORS TOLD KHOAN THAT THE RESTRICTION WAS </p><p>PROTECTIONIST AND HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THEIR PRODUCTION </p><p>PLANS.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, KHOAN ASSURED THE </p><p>BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES THAT HE PERSONALLY WOULD WORK ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE, BUT CLAIMED THAT A MAJOR REASON BEHIND THE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS WAS TO CURB VIETNAM\'S SOARING MOTORBIKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02493  02 OF 02  150724Z </p><p>ACCIDENT RATE.  (COMMENT:  EMBASSY SERIOUSLY DOUBTS THIS </p><p>CLAIM.  END COMMENT)  OTHER GVN OFFICIALS ARE CLAIMING THAT </p><p>THE QUOTAS WERE "FROZEN" BECAUSE JAPANESE MAKERS ARE NOT </p><p>FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR "LOCAL CONTENT" AS </p><p>STIPULATED IN THEIR INVESTMENT LICENSES.  (COMMENT:  MORE </p><p>LIKELY.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>CTBT AND TERRORISM: AGREEING, BUT NOT COMPLETELY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  JAPAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTER YORIKO KAWAGUCHI MET </p><p>WITH FM NIEN AND REQUESTED THAT VIETNAM QUICKLY RATIFY THE </p><p>CTBT.  ACCORDING TO QUANG AND PRESS REPORTS, NIEN TOLD </p><p>KAWAGUCHI THAT VIETNAM AGREES WITH JAPAN ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>RATIFICATION.  THE CPV\'S QUANG TOLD POLOFF THAT THE CTBT IS </p><p>NOW "BEING REVIEWED" IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>(MFA) AND HAS NOT YET BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER.  QUANG WAS UNABLE TO OFFER A PREDICTION </p><p>AS TO WHEN THE MFA WOULD FINISH ITS REVIEW.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>JAPANESE EMBOFFS, THE VIETNAMESE SIDE REJECTED JAPANESE </p><p>PROPOSED COMMUNIQU LANGUAGE THAT CTBT RATIFICATION WAS OF </p><p>"UTMOST" IMPORTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  CONCERNING TERRORISM, QUANG SAID MANH DISCUSSED </p><p>THE ISSUE "BRIEFLY AND GENERALLY" WITH KOIZUMI BUT DID NOT </p><p>GO INTO DETAILS.  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT ON THE NEED TO </p><p>CONTINUE EFFORTS TO ERADICATE TERRORISM, BUT NO PLANS FOR </p><p>ANY NEW FORMS OF BILATERAL COOPERATION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>JAPANESE EMBOFFS, REFERENCES IN THE JOINT COMMUNIQU TO </p><p>EARLIER APEC AND ASEM DECLARATIONS ON TERRORISM WERE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02493  02 OF 02  150724Z </p><p>INSERTED AT VIETNAM\'S REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ROYAL VISIT UNLIKEY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  MANH REITERATED AN INVITATION FOR THE EMPEROR </p><p>AND EMPRESS TO VISIT VIETNAM.  PRIME MINISTER KHAI HAD ALSO </p><p>ISSUED THIS INVITATION WHEN KOIZUMI VISITED VIETNAM LAST </p><p>APRIL.  SOURCES HERE PREDICT THAT SUCH A VISIT IS UNLIKELY, </p><p>HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>KEEPING A BALANCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  DURING MANH\'S VISIT, THE CPV ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR </p><p>HIM TO VISIT RUSSIA "IN THE COMING DAYS," WITHOUT PROVIDING </p><p>ACTUAL DATES.  JAPANESE EMBOFFS NOTED THAT THE TIMING OF </p><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS UNLIKELY TO BE COINCIDENTAL, AND WAS </p><p>PROBABLY INTENDED BY VIETNAM AS SHOWING NO FAVORITISM IN ITS </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THESE TWO IMPORTANT PARTNERS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
