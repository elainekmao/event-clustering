FAO </p><p>WELCOMED INCREASING DONOR SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCIES BUT </p><p>NOTED THAT MANY APPEALS WERE STILL UNDERFUNDED.  IN THE </p><p>CASE OF IRAQ, FAO STAFF STATED THAT AFTER YEARS OF </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE AGRICULTURAL PORTION OF THE OIL FOR FOOD </p><p>(OFF) PROGRAM, FAO HAD THE IN-COUNTRY PERSONNEL AND THE </p><p>CAPACITY TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO IRAQ\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION -- IF ADEQUATELY FUNDED.

END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FAO OFFICIALS BRIEFED DONORS MAY 21, 2003 ON THE </p><p>SITUATION IN SELECTED COUNTRIES RECEIVING EMERGENCY </p><p>AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE THROUGH FAO.  THE </p><p>FOCUS OF THE BRIEFING WAS PRIMARILY "POST-CONFLICT" </p><p>COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS COVERED AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02370  01 OF 04  290702Z </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  FAO OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZED THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AS </p><p>"VERY DIFFICULT" AS FAR AS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD </p><p>PRODUCTION.  FAO HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SEGMENT OF THE OIL FOR FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM SINCE 1997 AND </p><p>HAS DISBURSED OVER USD 450 MILLION IN INPUTS.  IN CENTRAL </p><p>AND SOUTH IRAQ, FAO OBSERVED GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ (GOI) </p><p>INPUT DISTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARIES; IN THE CASE OF DUAL </p><p>USE PRODUCTS, CERTIFIED THAT THEY WERE INTENDED FOR </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES.  IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNATES, FAO </p><p>FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM BY PROVIDING </p><p>INPUTS IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>REHABILITATION, SUCH AS VACCINATION OF LIVESTOCK AND WELL </p><p>DRILLING.  FAO HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A 13 YEAR </p><p>REHABILITATION PLAN FOR THE NORTHERN GOVERNATES WHICH FAO </p><p>OFFICIALS RECOMMENDED TO "THE NEW AUTHORITIES." </p><p> </p><p>4.  FAO OFFICIALS RECALLED THAT THE UN USD 2.2 BILLION </p><p>FLASH APPEAL CONTAINED A USD 87 MILLION AGRICULTURAL </p><p>COMPONENT.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO, 30 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS AND ONE THIRD OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S FOOD REQUIREMENTS ARE GROWN NATIONALLY: </p><p>AGRICULTURE MUST BE A PRIORITY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MUCH </p><p>AS THE COUNTRY HAS DEPENDED ON FOOD RATIONS, SO </p><p>AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN DEPENDENT ON STATE SUPPLIED INPUTS; </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE FAO, THE IRAQI AGRICULTURAL SECTOR </p><p>"CANNOT NOW FUNCTION WITHOUT SUPPORT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT FOOD AID NEEDS WERE BEING MET, FAO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02370  01 OF 04  290702Z </p><p>STAFF CAUTIONED THAT THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SIDE WAS </p><p>"NOT IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE."  A WHEAT HARVEST ESTIMATED AT </p><p>700,000 TONS WAS IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT IN THE FORM </p><p>OF TRUCKS FOR TRANSPORT, SPARE PARTS FOR COMBINES AND </p><p>FUEL.  FAO STRESSED THAT THE TOP PRIORITY WAS THE CURRENT </p><p>HARVEST AND THE CURRENT PLANTING SEASON.  CONCERNING </p><p>SEED, FAO REPORTED THAT PREVIOUSLY SEED WAS NOT IMPORTED </p><p>--  ALL NATIONAL NEEDS WERE OBTAINED FROM FARMERS. </p><p>HOWEVER, FOR THE NEXT SEASON, THEY ANTICIPATED HAVING TO </p><p>"IMPORT MASSIVELY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON POULTRY PRODUCTION, FAO STATED THAT 4,000 FARMS </p><p>HAD BEEN PRODUCING POULTRY.  THEY NOTED THAT POULTRY WAS </p><p>AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF PROTEIN, AS MEAT WAS NOT PROVIDED </p><p>IN THE FOOD RATION.  MANY FARMS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING; </p><p>BIRDS HAD DIED, THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY.  IRAQ\'S 1.5 </p><p>MILLION CATTLE AND 18 MILLION SHEEP AND GOATS NEEDED </p><p>VACCINES, BUT COLD CHAINS NEEDED TO BE RESTORED BEFORE </p><p>VACCINES WERE PROVIDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.

IN URGING </p><p>DONOR SUPPORT, FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT EXISTING </p><p>CONTRACTS UNDER THE OFF PROGRAM WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>SITUATION BEFORE THE CURRENT CRISIS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY </p><p>HAVE EXISTING CONTRACTS FOR POULTRY FEED, BUT NOT FOR </p><p>VACCINES, DRUGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR.  (FURTHERMORE, </p><p>FAO HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD COUNT ON RESOURCES WITHIN </p><p>COUNTRY, BUT USD 500 MILLION OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS </p><p>IN STORAGE HAD BEEN STOLEN AND THE FAO OFFICES IN BAGHDAD </p><p>WERE LOOTED.)  THAT BEING SAID, ACCORDING TO ASSISTANT </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL (ADG) HENRI CARSALADE, FAO IS REVISING </p><p>ITS SHARE OF THE UN APPEAL TO REFLECT ITS ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS </p><p>NO OVERLAP WITH OFF. </p><p> </p><p>8. DONOR QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON THE ABSENCE OF MARKET </p><p>MECHANISMS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS.  FAO OFFICIALS AGREED ON THE NEED </p><p>FOR REFORMS, NOTING THAT FAO HAD BEEN WORKING ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE SINCE BEFORE THE CONFLICT.  ADG CARSALADE STATED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02370  02 OF 04  290702Z </p><p>THAT "ONCE THE AUTHORITIES ARE GIVEN LEGITIMACY BY THE </p><p>UN" THE FAO WOULD BE ABLE TO "OFFER PROPOSALS FOR FAR- </p><p>REACHING REFORM TO THE AUTHORITIES." </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN -- MOVING FROM INPUTS TO POLICY </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>9.  IN 2002, ENDOWED WITH FULL FUNDING FROM DONORS (SOME </p><p>USD 44 MILLION), FAO FOCUSED ON PROVIDING AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INPUTS SUCH AS SEEDS, LOCUST CONTROL AND PROVISION OF </p><p>CHICKS AND EGGS.  ACCORDING TO FAO OFFICIALS THESE INPUTS </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY REACHED "ALL CORNERS" OF AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>INCLUDING REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED. </p><p> </p><p>10. FAO IS MOVING AWAY FROM INPUTS IN 2003 AND TOWARDS </p><p>POLICY ADVICE AND TRAINING FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE (MINAG).  ULTIMATELY FAO HOPES TO MOVE FOOD </p><p>SECURITY AND EARLY WARNING ACTIVITIES INTO THE MINAG.  A </p><p>SAMPLE OF CURRENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: TRAINING FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN OFFICIALS TO PUT IN PLACE </p><p>LOCUST CONTROL MEASURES; PERFORMING, WITH THE MINAG, A </p><p>SURVEY ON WATER RESOURCES AND IRRIGATION; A SURVEY ON THE </p><p>HORTICULTURE SECTOR, INCLUDING STUDIES ON MARKETING AND </p><p>POST-HARVEST.  FAO SUPPORT FOR VACCINATION AGAINST </p><p>LIVESTOCK DISEASES (INCLUDING FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, </p><p>ANTHRAX, NEWCASTLE DISEASE AND SHEEP POX) CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY FOR AFGHANISTAN, BUT TO </p><p>PROTECT LIVESTOCK IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

FAO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL HENRI CARSALADE NOTED </p><p>THAT OPIUM PRODUCTION HAD "EXPLODED" IN 2002; THE AREAS </p><p>WHERE POPPY WAS GROWN (SOME 40 PERCENT OF ARABLE LAND) </p><p>WERE KNOWN AND MAPPED, BUT THE AREAS WERE "NOT CONTROLLED </p><p>BY THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES."  FAO IS COLLABORATING WITH </p><p>THE UN OFFICE OF DRUG CONTROL POLICY (UNDCP) TO DEVELOP </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS TO OPIUM POPPY </p><p>CULTIVATION, FOCUSING ON EXPANDING TRADITIONAL CROPS AND </p><p>IN LINE WITH THE GOA\'S SOON TO BE FINALIZED NATIONAL DRUG </p><p>CONTROL STRATEGY.  FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT FAO HAS </p><p>INITIATED FAO\'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS) </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN, AND THAT TWO OF THE SPFS PROJECTS ARE TO </p><p>BE IN POPPY-GROWING AREAS.  (COMMENT: SPFS PROJECTS ARE </p><p>TYPICALLY PILOT-TYPE PROJECTS CO-FUNDED BY FAO AND THE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT).

ACCORDING TO ANNE BAUER, DIRECTOR OF FAO\'S EMERGENCY </p><p>OPERATIONS AND REHABILITATION DIVISION, THE LATEST APPEAL </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN, ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2002, CONTAINED A USD </p><p>44 MILLION COMPONENT FOR AGRICULTURE.  SHE NOTED THAT </p><p>DONORS HAD NOT YET RESPONDED AS GENEROUSLY AS IN 2002 AND </p><p>SHE APPEALED TO DONORS TO FUND THE ACTIVITIES, "OR ELSE </p><p>FAO WILL NEED TO SCALE DOWN DRAMATICALLY IN AFGHANISTAN." </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA -- LOOKING THROUGH THE HIV/AIDS LENS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>13.  FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT THE FOOD EMERGENCY IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS "NOT JUST A DROUGHT-INDUCED CRISIS" </p><p>AND CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT, EVEN WITH </p><p>IMPROVING WEATHER AND CROPS, SOME 15 MILLION HIV/AIDS </p><p>VICTIMS WOULD STILL NEED SOME FORM OF FOOD AID.  WFP </p><p>OFFICIAL FRANCESCO STRIPPOLI ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND SOUTHERN MOZAMBIQUE WAS "NOT VERY </p><p>PROMISING;" A REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATION WAS STILL </p><p>NEEDED, BUT "LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ONE." HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE WAS CAUSED BY "GOVERNANCE" </p><p>PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02370  03 OF 04  290702Z </p><p>14.  FAO OFFICIALS STATED THAT THEY HAD RAISED SOME USD </p><p>17 MILLION -- ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE APPEAL.  THEY HAVE </p><p>BENEFITED SOME 500,000 HOUSEHOLDS WITH SEEDS, TOOLS, </p><p>LIVESTOCK REPLENISHMENT, ANIMAL DISEASE CONTROL AND </p><p>DROUGHT AND LABOR-SAVING TOOLS AND PRACTICES.  FAO </p><p>OFFICIALS STATED THAT, LOOKING UPSTREAM, THEY WOULD </p><p>"REVIEW EVERYTHING FAO DOES IN THE REGION THROUGH THE </p><p>HIV/AIDS LENS."  THIS INCLUDES ADDING NEW INDICATORS FOR </p><p>EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND TARGETING ELDERLY WOMEN AND </p><p>ORPHANS("THOSE WHO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CRISIS.") </p><p> </p><p>15.  DONOR COMMENTS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA FOCUSED ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE, PARTICULARLY QUESTIONS ON FAO\'S "DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT" CONCERNING OPENING MARKETS AND THE </p><p>SITUATION OF DISPLACED COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND FARM </p><p>WORKERS. FAO OFFICIALS RESPONDED THAT THE "SITUATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE REMAINS VERY SERIOUS."  CONCERNING THE MOST </p><p>RECENT CROP ASSESSMENT, FAO OFFICIAL HENRI JOSSERAND </p><p>STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WAS STILL </p><p>"DEFINING ITS POSITION POSITION" AS REGARDS THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>HARVEST." </p><p> </p><p>ANGOLA </p><p>------- </p><p>16.  FAO OFFICIALS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN </p><p>ANGOLA.  IN 2002, DONORS (PRIMARILY THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>JAPAN) PROVIDED FUNDS FOR SEEDS AND TOOLS. IN 2003 THE </p><p>FAO APPEAL IS FOCUSING ON ASSISTANCE TO INTERNALLY </p><p>DISPLACED (IDP) ANGOLANS.  WITH THE USD 7.5 MILLION </p><p>ALREADY RAISED (INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES) THEY </p><p>EXPECT TO REACH SOME 360,000 HOUSEHOLDS.

THE JUNE 9-10 PLEDGING CONFERENCE IN TOKYO WILL </p><p>ENABLE FAO TO EMBARK ON A DETAILED PROJECT PREPARATION </p><p>FOR SRI LANKA.  FAO OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT "SINCE THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WAS MOVING POSITIVELY" IN SRI LANKA, THEY </p><p>WERE DOING "SIMULTANEOUS PROGRAMMING" OF DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES.  TWENTY YEARS OF CONFLICT HAS </p><p>RESULTED IN REDUCED AREAS OF CULTIVATION, LIVESTOCK LOST </p><p>AND FISHING AFFECTED BY DESTRUCTION OF FISHING </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.
