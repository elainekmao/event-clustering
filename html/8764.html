<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001377 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ASEC, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: RECENT REPORTS OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES UNSUBSTANTIATED </p><p> </p><p>REF: RSO/DS E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reason 1.5 (b, </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  AP reported on 6/13 that Yemeni police defused a </p><p>time bomb outside the Hadda Hotel late on Thursday, June 12. </p><p>The hotel is located about 150 yards from a residential </p><p>compound housing many foreigners, including Embassy staff. </p><p>Foreign Minister Qirbi, the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and </p><p>the Political Security Organization (PSO) have all assured </p><p>the Embassy that this report is untrue. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The 6/13 AP article by Ahmed Al-Haj reported that </p><p>"security guards found the bomb placed against the outside </p><p>wall of the four-star Hadda Hotel shortly before midnight </p><p>Thursday...."  Al-Haj said "police have made no arrests in </p><p>the incident, which came a day after a bomb exploded about a </p><p>mile from the hotel."  This story has since been picked up by </p><p>the Yemen Times, a bi-weekly english-language publication, as </p><p>well as both regional and international press. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  While investigating the AP report, TDY RSO was </p><p>informed by Yemen Hunt Oil Security Manager Ralph Gonzales </p><p>that according to his (unnamed) sources, a hand grenade, not </p><p>an improvised explosive device (IED), was found at/near the </p><p>Hadda Hotel. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  RSO met with the manager of Hadda Hotel on June 15, </p><p>2003.  The manager does not consider the person who reported </p><p>finding the IED credible.  In addition, on 6/16 TDY RSO was </p><p>informed by the DATT that both DAO and Pol/Mil sources agree </p><p>the AP report is a hoax. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Embassy officials have engaged ROYG at numerous </p><p>levels -- from the Foreign Minister to MOI to PSO -- and have </p><p>been unable to confirm either Thursday night\'s recovery of an </p><p>IED, or the previous day\'s explosion alluded to in Al-Haj\'s </p><p>article; or the grenade incident reported by Hunt Oil. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
