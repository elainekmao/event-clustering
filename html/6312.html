<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001526 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN HOTELIERS HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS </p><p>POST-SADDAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: Having slightly recovered from a </p><p>post-September 11 drop in regional tourism, Jordan\'s hotel </p><p>industry is now reeling in the face of uncertainty over </p><p>conflict in neighboring Iraq.  Despite the downturn, the </p><p>sector is not under threat of financial collapse, due to a </p><p>reluctance on the part of banks to assume ownership of hotel </p><p>properties and continue creative financing.  Hotel managers </p><p>continue to seek creative ways to work out of the slump, but </p><p>stress that even a post-Saddam Iraq will not bring sufficient </p><p>stability to the region that would lead to an increase in </p><p>tourism unless concurrent progress on the Palestinian-Israeli </p><p>front is attained.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>LOTS OF ROOM AT THE INN </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) We met with Michel Nazzal, owner of the Radisson SAS </p><p>hotels in Amman and Aqaba and President of the Jordan Hotel </p><p>Association (JHA), on March 11 to get an update on the state </p><p>of Jordan\'s hotel industry given continued regional </p><p>instability and the possibility of a conflict with Iraq.  The </p><p>JHA represents Jordan\'s 400 hotels, and is the major </p><p>shareholder in the Amman College for Hospitality and Tourism </p><p>Education, one of the largest such schools in the region. </p><p>The Nazzal family, owners of the Radisson SAS hotels in Amman </p><p>and Aqaba, has been in the hotel business since 1923, when it </p><p>built the since-razed Philadelphia Hotel across from the </p><p>Roman Amphitheater in downtown Amman.  Nazzal has led the JHA </p><p>since 1999. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Nazzal told us that occupancy rates at Jordanian </p><p>hotels for the spring are hovering at about 20%, the </p><p>exception being the Intercontinental, currently home to most </p><p>of the foreign press.  (NOTE: For example, according to </p><p>Nazzal, 267 rooms were filled at the Intercontinental on </p><p>March 10, compared to 34 at the Four Seasons, 66 at the </p><p>Holiday Inn, 88 at the Sheraton, and 100 at the Marriott. </p><p>END NOTE)  He said that hotels have already written off </p><p>spring and are close to doing the same for summer, given the </p><p>pending conflict.  Room rates have fallen as well, with an </p><p>average rate of JD47 ($66) for 2002, down from JD100 ($140) </p><p>in the late 90s.  Nazzal said that even pre-conflict, the </p><p>trend had been heading downward worldwide, as people "are </p><p>afraid to fly right now".  As a result, the share of tourism </p><p>in GDP has dropped from 12% to 9% since 2000.  Approximately </p><p>25,000 workers are employed in the Jordanian tourism </p><p>industry. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>DEBT ROLLS OVER; HOTELS DO NOT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Nazzal stressed, however, that despite the low </p><p>occupancy rates and the attendant effect on revenues, most </p><p>hotels are not in danger of going out of business, despite </p><p>the JD174/$224m in short term debts they collectively owe to </p><p>local banks.  He said that when a hotel is on the verge of </p><p>bankruptcy, the bank that holds the loan simply rolls it over </p><p>for another year at 10% interest.  Consequently, he said, </p><p>what little revenue that continues to roll in is spent on </p><p>servicing the debt, not on hotel upkeep or development.  He </p><p>said that banks don\'t want hotels to default because "they </p><p>can\'t do anything with them; no one wants to buy them, </p><p>bankers do not want to manage them, and they can\'t just tear </p><p>them down".  (In addition, some banks already have equity in </p><p>hotels, see SEPTEL on the banking sector.)  Nazzal added that </p><p>efforts to get the banks to refinance the debt for 20 years </p><p>at 7% have thus far proven futile. (NOTE: This latter idea </p><p>grew from a USAID-organized seminar for hoteliers and bankers </p><p>that focused on seeking creative alternatives to traditional </p><p>hotel financing held in Amman in February.  END NOTE)  He </p><p>also pointed out that the hotel sector in Petra, which has </p><p>been especially hard hit by the decline in tourism, is a </p><p>different case.  Under a special agreement with the </p><p>government-owned Industrial Development Bank, which holds </p><p>most of the Petra hotels debt, the bank accepts cars and </p><p>houses in lieu of hotel property when default looms, leaving </p><p>the owner with the hotel and not much else. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>COME TO CAMP JORDAN </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) As a result of the slump, the JHA is looking </p><p>creatively at other ways to market the Kingdom.  He said that </p><p>one proposal is regional--to set up summer youth camps in </p><p>Jordan for kids from Gulf countries.  The JHA is projecting </p><p>that, given the right conditions (i.e. regional stability), </p><p>the camps could attract 5000 participants the first year.  He </p><p>said the camps would be geared towards recreation, arts, and </p><p>Arab culture.  Nazzal said that it is hoped the families of </p><p>these kids, with four-five members each, would come to Jordan </p><p>as well and "fill up our hotel rooms," with packages that </p><p>attracted medical tourists or other incentives that cater to </p><p>adults. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Another plan is to market Petra as something more </p><p>than a tourist destination, as "Petra needs something else," </p><p>according to Nazzal.  He said that plans to build a </p><p>convention center in Petra are being discussed, with an eye </p><p>towards making it a value-added destination, perhaps a </p><p>worldwide center for art and sculpture.  He said that years </p><p>ago, for example, Davos was little more than a ski resort; </p><p>now, "it is a place synonymous with economics and its </p><p>consequent development into a conference hub reflects that </p><p>image."  He said that Arabs are not interested in cultural </p><p>tourism, so "we have to find something else.  We can\'t </p><p>compete with the Emirates on shopping.  We can\'t compete with </p><p>Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon on gambling, entertainment, and </p><p>night life. What are we to do?"  Regarding Aqaba, he said he </p><p>still hasn\'t seen any impact on occupancy rates since the </p><p>designation of the ASEZA--"they haven\'t changed for ten </p><p>years."   He said there is little coordination between hotel </p><p>owners, ASEZA officials, and the Aqaba Chamber of Commerce, </p><p>but he said the long-term plans were "sound" and hoped they </p><p>would "truly lead to implementing the overall vision of Aqaba </p><p>as a world-class tourist destination." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>EX-SADDAM ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Nazzal concluded by saying that the hotels were </p><p>girding for better days post-Saddam, but uncertainty over the </p><p>duration of the conflict continued to be pervasive.  He said </p><p>he hoped it would be "clean and fast", and said that </p><p>resolution of the Iraqi situation "is only one part of the </p><p>solution."  He said "the U.S. can\'t forget the Palestinians," </p><p>and stressed that only stability both east and west of Jordan </p><p>would bring international tourists back to the region. </p><p>Nazzal cited the prospect of offering Biblical tourism </p><p>packages that would include Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria </p><p>and Iraq has having the potential to lead to a "resurrection" </p><p>of the Jordanian tourist industry. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Nazzal\'s view that a peaceful, post-Saddam Iraq will </p><p>not alone bring stability to the region is consistent with </p><p>messages we hear from other Jordanian interlocutors with ties </p><p>to business, commerce, and finance.  Absent a sustained peace </p><p>and stability on either side of Jordan, we can expect the </p><p>downturn in tourism to continue, to the detriment of the </p><p>country and economy as a whole. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
