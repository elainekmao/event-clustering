<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 002367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC - WILSON AND EUR/SE </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY/KALVAREZ, PATENT AND </p><p>TRADEMARK OFFICE FOR URBAN, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS FOR TEPP </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOT\'s Views on Special 301 Review of </p><p>Intellectual Property Protection </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On April 10, Oya Karakas, Head of Department in </p><p>the MFA General Directorate of Multilateral Economic </p><p>Affairs, sent Embassy the following note on intellectual </p><p>property protection in Turkey.  The note contends that </p><p>data exclusivity protection for pharmaceuticals is not </p><p>required by the TRIPS Agreement.  Embassy recommends </p><p>that Washington agencies rebut Turkey\'s position on this </p><p>by providing talking points for Embassy and/or </p><p>transmitting a letter on this subject from a senior U.S. </p><p>official.  We also wonder if it might be possible to </p><p>generate a letter from the WTO Secretariat confirming </p><p>that TRIPS does require data exclusivity.  Once the </p><p>regional crisis is over, Embassy suggests Washington </p><p>agencies consider sending a representative to Ankara to </p><p>engage the Turks on IPR issues, and on data exclusivity </p><p>in particular.  We note that the EU has recently stepped </p><p>up its campaign to persuade Ankara on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Begin Text MFA Note: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>07.04.2003 </p><p>CEGY-I </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY\'S VIEWS ON "THE SPECIAL 301 REVIEW" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since we consider protection of intellectual property as </p><p>an important tool to encourage and promote human </p><p>creativity and productivity, we aim at meeting </p><p>international standards and fulfilling our commitments </p><p>stemming from international agreements in the area of </p><p>intellectual property protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this context, we have already adopted relevant </p><p>international agreements in order to create an </p><p>environment where a certain level of intellectual </p><p>property protection is ensured. However, a transition </p><p>period is required before full implementation and </p><p>enforcement of new legislation. The process to impose </p><p>new trade rules takes a certain time even in developed </p><p>economies. As a developing economy Turkey has so far </p><p>achieved a significant progress despite risks of </p><p>unemployment and short-term losses of income. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So far, we have welcomed criticisms brought forward by </p><p>our trade partners in the framework of our international </p><p>commitments, such as those voiced at the World Trade </p><p>Organization TRIPS Council during the review of our </p><p>legislation, which was successfully concluded. In this </p><p>connection, we attach importance to comments of the </p><p>United States Government and its "Special 301 Review". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the context of "Special 301 Review", we have had a </p><p>satisfactory level of cooperation with the US Government </p><p>up to now and we expect this to continue. We are also </p><p>pleased with the interest of the US companies and the </p><p>concerned specialised associations in the implementation </p><p>and enforcement of intellectual property protection in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The points, raised by these associations, namely IIPA, </p><p>IACC and PhRMA, and the comments mentioned in their </p><p>submissions, have received Turkish Government\'s due </p><p>consideration and our relevant authorities have studied </p><p>them in detail with respect to their technical aspects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the comments of IIPA and IACC, we have noted </p><p>the mentioned problems of implementation and </p><p>enforcement. Our efforts to improve the capacity and </p><p>expertise of law enforcement authorities in this field </p><p>are further increased. In this connection, we should </p><p>also take into account the economic situation in the </p><p>aftermath of a severe financial crisis. Since, immediate </p><p>implications of enforcement of intellectual property </p><p>protection are unemployment and loss of income for some </p><p>segments of society; in some cases this issue becomes </p><p>very sensitive. As we all know, accommodation of </p><p>intellectual property protection and development issues </p><p>is a widespread matter of debate in various </p><p>international fora. We should also bear in mind that </p><p>some alleged copyright violations concern educational </p><p>materials and this requires a special attention. </p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate the relatively balanced </p><p>approach of these two associations and again we assure </p><p>that these comments will receive our due consideration </p><p>and appropriate measures will be taken accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the reports of the IIPA and IACC, there are certain </p><p>remarks concerning the court proceedings and the </p><p>sentences, which claim that the courts are not </p><p>sufficiently expedient, the procedures are extremely </p><p>burdensome for the right holders, the sentences are not </p><p>deterrent and there are delays and procedural hurdles. </p><p>In general these observations do not reflect the whole </p><p>picture. The Turkish legislation and the relevant </p><p>regulations, concerning the intellectual property </p><p>protection and its enforcement are in conformity with </p><p>the international agreements, which both Turkey and the </p><p>US are party of. The competent judicial authorities are </p><p>implementing this legislation accordingly. We are aware </p><p>of some practical shortcomings about the implementation; </p><p>nevertheless the Ministry of Justice is taking measures </p><p>to eradicate these problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some of the complaints are stemming from the fact that </p><p>the Turkish legal system has characteristics different </p><p>from the US system. Therefore, American companies, which </p><p>are not accurately informed about the procedural details </p><p>of legal proceedings, are sometimes facing some </p><p>unexpected developments, which are interpreted as delays </p><p>and burdens. If these problems are brought to the </p><p>attention of relevant authorities, further clarification </p><p>can be made in order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for the criticisms regarding the administrative </p><p>measures, relevant instructions given to the </p><p>administrative authorities. In this context, we should </p><p>bear in mind the dynamic nature of the intellectual </p><p>property rights to be protected and the advantages of </p><p>the counterfeiters who make use of modern technology. </p><p>However, the Turkish Government is taking measures to </p><p>cope with the piracy to ensure proper enforcement and </p><p>enhance the existing infrastructure. On the other hand, </p><p>we also see cases where American companies are not well </p><p>aware of the administrative procedures and details and </p><p>their complaints are not justified in all cases. Again, </p><p>if the problems faced are brought to the attention of </p><p>relevant authorities, further clarification can be made </p><p>in order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this connection, we also wish to emphasize the fact </p><p>that positive developments are not properly reflected in </p><p>these reports. The implementation and enforcement of </p><p>intellectual property rights has been improved in the </p><p>course of the last year and there is growing level of </p><p>awareness in this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for the comments of PhRMA, needless to say health </p><p>issues have a special dimension in the context of </p><p>international trade regulations. Public health is such </p><p>an issue that it cannot be regulated only by trade </p><p>concerns. Special considerations of governments in </p><p>health and social policies should be given due respect. </p><p>As we know, one of the most heated debates of the WTO </p><p>Doha Development Agenda Negotiations is on this very </p><p>issue and there is a growing global concern on the </p><p>relationship between public health and intellectual </p><p>property protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Compared with other social policy issues, health </p><p>policies have a particular significance, since in some </p><p>cases it is a question of life or death. It is not a </p><p>surprise that health issues have a priority among others </p><p>for governments and they have particular connections </p><p>with economic and social policies. Therefore, in the </p><p>context of international trade, they require flexibility </p><p>more than other trade issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The comments of PhRMA, which seem to have a more bitter </p><p>tone, have also received our due consideration and </p><p>appropriate measures are taken accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regarding these comments we wish to present an overview </p><p>of the current situation of intellectual property rights </p><p>and their implementation, concerning pharmaceutical </p><p>products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) is the most </p><p>comprehensive international instrument ever negotiated </p><p>on intellectual property rights. TRIPS Agreement </p><p>established minimum universal standards concerning </p><p>patents and undisclosed information (trade secrets) as </p><p>well as copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, </p><p>geographical indications and integrated circuits. Since </p><p>Turkey is a member of WTO and thus, a signatory to TRIPS </p><p>Agreement, our legislation on patents and protection of </p><p>undisclosed data is in compliance with the TRIPS </p><p>Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Patents </p><p>Although, Article 65 of the TRIPS Agreement gave Turkey </p><p>the right to delay granting pharmaceutical process and </p><p>products patents until 1 January 2000 and 1 January </p><p>2005, respectively, the Patent Decree No 551 came into </p><p>force in 1995. The new legislation was prepared in the </p><p>light of the TRIPS Agreement and the European Patent </p><p>Convention (EPC). Turkey began to file applications in </p><p>1995 and patents are granted since 1 January 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Patentability criteria, protection term of 20 years, </p><p>compulsory license provisions of the Turkish legislation </p><p>are all compatible with the TRIPS Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A careful evaluation of the relevant Turkish legislation </p><p>clearly shows that Turkey provides higher patent </p><p>protection standards for pharmaceuticals than required </p><p>by TRIPS Agreement. The review of Turkish legislation on </p><p>intellectual property by TRIPS Council also proved the </p><p>conformity of the legislation in Turkey with the TRIPS </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Data Protection </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Data protection is an obligation foreseen by Article 39 </p><p>of the TRIPS Agreement. Article 39 of the TRIPS </p><p>Agreement requires Members to protect undisclosed </p><p>information submitted to governments or governmental </p><p>agencies, as a condition of approving the marketing of </p><p>pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products </p><p>which utilise new chemical entities, against unfair </p><p>commercial use. Turkey also fulfilled its commitments on </p><p>data protection (protection of undisclosed data against </p><p>unfair commercial use) by amending its legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are five specific provisions of Turkish </p><p>legislation which should be mentioned: Firstly, Contract </p><p>Law, No. 818 brings obligation on the workers not to </p><p>divulge business secrets of the employee.  They may also </p><p>be prohibited from dealing with competing works.  The </p><p>remedy for the infringement is compensation of the </p><p>damages. Secondly, the Commercial Code provides that </p><p>seducing the employees, agents etc. into divulging </p><p>trading secrets of their employer, taking an illicit </p><p>advantage from trade secrets obtained incompatible with </p><p>good faith, or divulging them to others, constitute </p><p>unfair competition.  The Code provides civil </p><p>(compensation for damages), and criminal sanctions </p><p>(Imprisonment and/or fire). Thirdly, the provisions of </p><p>the Patent Decree No. 551 are in conformity with Article </p><p>39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement concerning the marketing </p><p>procedures. Within this framework the Patent Decree No. </p><p>551 obliges public authorities (who take application for </p><p>marketing permission for pharmaceutical, agrochemicals </p><p>or veterinary products) not to disclose information and </p><p>test results, and keep them secret; and fourthly the </p><p>Regulation for Pharmaceutical Products which is in force </p><p>since 1996, brings the same responsibility to the </p><p>Ministry of Health to protect secrecy of information and </p><p>test results disclosed by the applicant during marketing </p><p>approval for pharmaceutical products. Lastly, the Civil </p><p>Servants Act No 657 supports the implementation of last </p><p>two pieces of legislation by bringing responsibility on </p><p>civil servants employed in the Ministries and public </p><p>institutions not to divulge secret business information </p><p>related to their services.  Infringing the act of those </p><p>two pieces of legislation brings responsibility of the </p><p>public administration in accordance with Administrative </p><p>Law Principles and legislation prepared within the </p><p>framework of Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution </p><p>(Article makes available to bring action against all </p><p>acts and transactions of the public administrations). </p><p>In such cases the remedy is compensation apart from the </p><p>disciplinary and criminal responsibility of the civil </p><p>servant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Data/Marketing Exclusivity </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity are not </p><p>covered by Turkish legislation, as it is the case in the </p><p>EU and the US. Only patented product is protected by the </p><p>Patent Law until the due date of the patent expires. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The data exclusivity is a provision of Article 4 of </p><p>Directive 65/65/EEC in EU and 21 U.S.C. Sec. 355 </p><p>(c)(3)(D)(ii) in USA. The term "protection of </p><p>undisclosed information" in Article 39 of the TRIPS </p><p>Agreement is not the same as the "data exclusivity" </p><p>concept in the EU and USA, and it is misleading to treat </p><p>them as being synonymous. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement only requires </p><p>protection of undisclosed information against unfair </p><p>commercial use. Data exclusivity is a TRIPS-plus </p><p>provision. Article 1 of TRIPS Agreement states that </p><p>"Members may, but shall not be obliged to, implement </p><p>their law more extensive protection than required by </p><p>this Agreement." Therefore, Turkey should not be imposed </p><p>to provide data exclusivity immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Considering the competitiveness of domestic </p><p>pharmaceutical industry, it shall adopt its legislation </p><p>to include data exclusivity provision after a </p><p>transitional period through negotiations for full </p><p>membership to EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In return of our good will on the issue of intellectual </p><p>property protection, we expect the same positive and </p><p>reasonable attitude from the US Government throughout </p><p>the exchange of views on this issue prior to the </p><p>finalization of the "Special 301 Review". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
