<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, CY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA PLEASED WITH FREE MOVEMENT OF GREEK </p><p>AND TURKISH CYPRIOTS, PUSHES FOR FURTHER CBMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) MFA Cyprus DG Ertugrul Apakan summoned EU and US </p><p>reps to discuss the free movement of Greek and Turkish </p><p>Cypriots that began on the island April 23.  Apakan claimed </p><p>that "TRNC President" Denktas has suggested the policy and </p><p>that the GOT had supported it from the beginning.  According </p><p>to Apakan, the current measure allows day-time travel only </p><p>but could be expanded at a later date.  Apakan further noted </p><p>that on April 23, 2268 Turkish Cypriots traveled to the </p><p>south, while 1475 Greek Cypriots traveled north.  (Note: </p><p>these figures were confirmed separately by the Greek </p><p>representative. End note.)  No pattern has been established </p><p>yet, as it appears more Greek than Turkish Cypriots crossed </p><p>earlier on the 24th.  Two gates are now open with a third </p><p>being negotiated.  No major security incidents have occurred, </p><p>Apakan said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Apakan averred that the Turkish Cypriot </p><p>administration is working on additional measures, including </p><p>"normalization of the flow of goods," as part of a CBM </p><p>package.  Denying that the proposed CBMs are a tactical move, </p><p>Apakan claimed that GOT hopes CBMs will create an atmosphere </p><p>conducive to building trust.  "Turkey wants a win-win." </p><p>Nevertheless, Apakan underscored that no amount of CBMs would </p><p>substitute for a comprehensive settlement.  He carefully </p><p>recited statements and proposals by Denktas in support of UN </p><p>peace initiatives and called on the EU to help as a third </p><p>party to resolve the Cyprus issue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
