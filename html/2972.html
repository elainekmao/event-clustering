<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002513 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR UNDERSECRETARY BOLTON AND A/S BLOOMFIELD </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KHDP, PREL, MASS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED U.S. SUPPORT FOR JORDAN\'S </p><p>DEMINING PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) We understand that the Department may be considering </p><p>consolidating its NADR Humanitarian Demining programs and </p><p>focusing on fewer countries in the coming fiscal years.  If </p><p>this is the case, we believe it is important for U.S. </p><p>political and military interests in the region -- and in OEF </p><p>-- that NADR funding for Jordan continue. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) King Abdullah has stuck his neck out for us on many </p><p>occasions this past year.  In the face of 20 months of </p><p>deepening Israeli-Palestinian violence, he has maintained a </p><p>policy of moderate, constructive engagement with both parties </p><p>and with other regional players.  His efforts have been </p><p>crucial in building Arab support for the Saudi (and now Arab </p><p>League) Peace Initiative.  Perhaps most importantly, </p><p>immediately after 9/11, the King was the strongest Arab voice </p><p>speaking out against terror and he backed up his words with </p><p>deeds.  Closely coordinating with us, he sent a Jordanian </p><p>army field hospital and a company of Jordanian deminers to </p><p>Afghanistan to support OEF. He also dispatched Jordanian </p><p>Special Forces to other locations in support of our global </p><p>war on terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The King made these decisions in the face of </p><p>widespread and growing anti-American sentiment in the region. </p><p> He showed himself to be a friend willing to risk the anger </p><p>of many in the Arab world to take a firm stand along with us. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Jordan\'s HD program, thanks to the United States\' </p><p>substantial support, is making steady progress.  Over 80,000 </p><p>mines have been pulled from the ground, the risks to </p><p>Jordanians living near mined areas has been greatly reduced </p><p>and hundreds of acres of scarce fertile land in the Jordan </p><p>Valley have been returned to cultivation.  This is a program </p><p>that works and -- we would argue -- should merit continued </p><p>support based on its own accomplishments. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) However, beyond that, we believe that a decision to </p><p>alter our traditional support for Jordan\'s HD program would </p><p>send a particularly bad signal at this time.  First, one of </p><p>Jordan\'s most visible contributions to OEF is its deminers. </p><p>To reduce assistance to the very branch of the Jordanian </p><p>Armed Forces (the Royal Corps of Engineers) that is standing </p><p>with us in Afghanistan does not make political or military </p><p>sense.  Beyond that, and looking ahead to future possible </p><p>objectives, we should think about what we would ask of Jordan </p><p>during or after any potential U.S. action in Iraq.  One very </p><p>tangible way the Jordanians could assist us in a post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq would be to help clear the land of mines and other </p><p>ordnance.  As we look to various scenarios that might take </p><p>place, we should make sure that those who have helped us in </p><p>the past and present, will have the resources they need to do </p><p>so in the future. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) We recognize that NADR HD funds are already stretched </p><p>very thin, and there are more worthy recipients than there </p><p>are resources.  That said, we strongly believe that -- given </p><p>the King\'s and Jordan\'s demonstrated commitment to our shared </p><p>values and joint endeavors -- every effort should be made to </p><p>maintain our NADR HD support for Jordan at current levels for </p><p>the next several fiscal years. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
