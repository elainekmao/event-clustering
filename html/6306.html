<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001579 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NEW GOVERNMENT: MORE ON ERDOGAN\'S TIMING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1546 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: AK leader Erdogan likely to submit his </p><p>candidate cabinet list March 13.  Possible he will emerge as </p><p>Prime Minister in office as of that date.  Still no </p><p>convincing sign, however, that he intends to pass a </p><p>parliamentary resolution approving U.S. troop deployment in </p><p>the next five-six days.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Three contacts from ruling AK Party and a journalist </p><p>with close ties to AK\'s leadership tell us party chairman </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan is likely to submit his candidate cabinet list </p><p>to President Sezer Thursday, March 13.  Another AK contact </p><p>sees the list not being submitted until March 17.  Erdogan </p><p>becomes P.M. in office as soon as Sezer approves a list and </p><p>sends it to parliament, so it is possible Erdogan will assume </p><p>the post by March 13. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AK Party parliamentary group deputy chairman Fatsa, </p><p>party deputy chairman for foreign policy Disli, outspoken </p><p>human rights and anti-corruption advocate and AK M.P. Yarbay, </p><p>and journalist Cengiz Candar told us separately March 12 they </p><p>think Erdogan will submit his list March 13.  Fatsa, Yarbay, </p><p>and Candar opined that the shuffle of current cabinet members </p><p>may be limited to half a dozen; Candar foresees Erdogan\'s </p><p>cabinet as substantially more action-oriented than the </p><p>cabinet of outgoing P.M. Abdullah Gul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In addition, while acknowledging that much is indexed </p><p>to the results of UNSC deliberations March 13, Candar said he </p><p>expects Erdogan to submit a new draft resolution approving </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops early the week of March 17.  For </p><p>their part, Yarbay and Fatsa reiterated the need for the U.S. </p><p>to give Erdogan an incentive to submit the draft resolution; </p><p>both mentioned, among other things, "guarantees" on Turkey\'s </p><p>post-Saddam role, on the status of the Turkmen, and on the </p><p>U.S. commitment against an independent Kurdish state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AK M.P. Turan Comez, who had served as Erdogan\'s </p><p>private secretary until last autumn\'s general election </p><p>campaign, told us March 12 he expects the cabinet list to </p><p>emerge March 17.  Comez expects a substantial shuffle, </p><p>involving a dozen posts; he affirmed that his name is under </p><p>consideration for the Health Ministry.  With better contacts </p><p>among the mass of AK M.P.s than most others, Comez has been </p><p>an accurate predictor of trends in AK, but in this case his </p><p>is the outrider view. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Deputy chairman Disli and Erdogan\'s secretary </p><p>confirmed to us March 12 that Erdogan was continuing to work </p><p>on his cabinet list late into the evening, which we interpret </p><p>as evidence he is aiming to present his list March 13.  We </p><p>continue to tell interlocutors that time is running out for </p><p>the GOT to pass a deployment resolution. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
