END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On the evening of May 14 post received a communique </p><p>from a group calling itself the "Popular Revolutionary </p><p>Forces" FPR announcing the beginning of a campaign to </p><p>overthrow the Maduro government and vowing to evict "Yankees" </p><p>and other foreign occupiers from Iraq (and presumably </p><p>Honduras).  The communique\'s rhetoric follows traditional </p><p>Latino revolutionary style.  It also identifies United </p><p>States, United Kingdom and Spanish diplomats accredited to </p><p>Honduras as legitimate military targets.  RSO has checked </p><p>with a number of sources and determined that FPR cells were </p><p>created in El Salvador in the 1970s-1980s and clandestinely </p><p>charged with agitating within unions and popular </p><p>organizations. The FPR was supported by the Salvadorian </p><p>guerrillas.  Four of the group\'s most powerful Honduran </p><p>leaders were exiled and then circa 1991 allowed to return to </p><p>Honduras. They subsequently violated an agreement not to </p><p>continue revolutionary activities. Two of those exiled were, </p><p>Gustavo Garcia Espana and Rigoberto Padilla Russell. </p><p>Clementina Garcia Espana, (Gustavo\'s sister) was also a </p><p>senior member, but not exiled.  Reftel, para 1 describes </p><p>thirty organizations involved in political demonstrations and </p><p>the eight groups that are the most anti-U.S. including the </p><p>Democratic Union (UD). </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  The FPR is believed to have been involved in the </p><p>burning of the AID building in Tegucigalpa in 1988.  Last </p><p>month there was an attempt by several anti-U.S. groups to </p><p>commemorate the 15 year anniversary of the attack with a </p><p>demonstration in front of the AID mission building.  While </p><p>the demonstration did not take place,  RSO sources with </p><p>access to activist planners, indicated that some leaders were </p><p>attempting to bring back former Leftists responsible for the </p><p>attack to help with training and to motivate current group </p><p>members.  The FPR, or persons using that name, have been </p><p>known to release communiques over the years since 1991 </p><p>against government policies and to call people to street </p><p>protests.  It is not possible at this time, given the </p><p>available information, to determine the "validity" of this </p><p>document.  Additionally, the document was provided to the </p><p>Embassy via  Honduran Military Intelligence (C-2).  RSO </p><p>Comment:  The C-2 organization is a small group struggling </p><p>with limited resources that has on occasion provided </p><p>information from questionable sources for questionable </p><p>reasons.  While the document was reportedly given to/obtained </p><p>from a local newspaper, post was unable to find any mention </p><p>of the communique in today\'s Press.  Normally, the local </p><p>press does not hesitate to report this type of story.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  RSO sources indicate that two leaders of the FPR (or </p><p>the attempt to create a new FPR) are Carolos Umberto Paz and </p><p>Carlos Umberto Amalya Amador (possible aka: Ramon Amalya </p><p>Amador).  Both were active in the recent May Day </p><p>demonstrations in Tegucigalpa, and were personally involved </p><p>in tearing down a fence at the National Congress.  Both have </p><p>been seen participating in demonstrations outside the Embassy </p><p>and RSO staff has photographed Paz painting a revolutionary </p><p>slogan on the street outside the Embassy during the last </p><p>demonstration.  Paz also reportedly played a role in the </p><p>burning of the AID building 15 years ago. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  It appears that Carlos Umberto Paz and Carlos </p><p>Umberto Amalya Amador are attempting to re-establish the FPR </p><p>as part of a continuing effort by certain elements to </p><p>de-stabilize the Maduro government. They are said to be </p><p>looking for "sponsors" and feel they will be easier to obtain </p><p>if they identify with their old name and organization. This </p><p>communique may be an early attempt to garner support for a </p><p>re-kindled FPR. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Paz, Amador, and several other members of the </p><p>original FPR, aka: Fuerzas Populares Revolutionarias - </p><p>Lorenzo Zelaya movement including Gustavo Garcia Espana, </p><p>Rigoberto Padilla Russell and Clementina Garcia Espana are </p><p>known to be active members of the party that became the </p><p>Democratic Union Party (Unificacion Demoncratica) or UD </p><p>represented in the National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Post has shared copies of the comminique with the UK </p><p>and Spanish missions and been in contact with the police who </p><p>are also assessing the information.  RSO and PolOff will meet </p><p>tomorrow with representatives from the UK and Spanish </p><p>diplomatic missions to brief them on the latest developments. </p><p> Based on information available, Post concurs with the </p><p>initial Honduran police assessment (assuming the document is </p><p>valid) that the communique represents an attempt to gain </p><p>political support and is not a realistic threat at this time. </p><p> Post will continue to investigate and provide additional </p><p>information as it becomes available.  Below is an informal </p><p>translation of the communique. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Popular Revolutionary Forces </p><p> </p><p>Communication </p><p> </p><p>We, the popular revolutionary Forces announce to the Honduran </p><p>people the beginning of our political and military activities </p><p>in an effort to eliminate the neo-liberal and pro-imperialist </p><p>government of Ricardo Maduro that is imposed on the majority </p><p>of our people. </p><p> </p><p>In the international arena, we condemn the military </p><p>occupation of Iraq by the United States, along with the </p><p>despicable governments of Great Britain and Spain. </p><p>We demand the immediate retreat of the Yankees\' occupation </p><p>forces in Iraq and support the fight of the Arab people </p><p>against the International Zionism. </p><p> </p><p>We, again, raise our trenches to fight politically and </p><p>militarily against the enemies of our people, who deeply </p><p>rooted in the government, distribute among themselves the </p><p>country\'s wealth whilst forsaking thousands of fellow </p><p>citizens. </p><p> </p><p>Our liberty rifles will be aimed from now on, to the heads of </p><p>those white-collar thieves; and as revolutionaries we swear </p><p>to not rest until we seize them and do justice in the name of </p><p>our country. </p><p> </p><p>We have defined our military objectives as the following: </p><p>fight political corruption amongst government employees; the </p><p>bourgeoisie\'s businesses, buildings, companies, as well as </p><p>their accomplices involved in such corruption.  For these </p><p>people, we have a long list of their addresses and know of </p><p>their movements. </p><p> </p><p>We have also defined as subjects of our military objectives </p><p>all diplomats of the governments of the United States of </p><p>America, Great Britain and Spain who are accredited in </p><p>Honduras. We won\'t rest until we avenge the blood of our </p><p>Iraqi brothers, who\'s peoples are today, victims of the </p><p>aggression of those countries. </p><p> </p><p>We urge the patriotic officers of the police and the army to </p><p>rebel against a tyrannical government.  Let your weapons </p><p>point to the thieves and corrupt officials who have wronged </p><p>this noble country. </p><p> </p><p>THE REVOLUTIONARY POPULAR FORCES call on this country\'s </p><p>popular and rebellious organizations, to repossess the </p><p>streets and overthrow this government that mangles the </p><p>dignity of the poor and humble citizens. </p><p>THE PEOPLE UNITED AND ARMED, SHALL NEVER BE DEFEATED OR </p><p>DESTROYED. </p><p> </p><p>From an unknown location in Honduras: </p><p>Political-military Commission of the </p><p>POLITICAL REVOLUTIONARY FORCES </p><p> </p><p>May 2003 END OF TRANSLATION </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
