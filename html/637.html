<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000954 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>LONDON FOR JOHNSON/PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p>KARACHI FOR LAWTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, PINS, UNHRC-1, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE LTTE: WHAT WE ARE SAYING AND WHO WE </p><p>          ARE SAYING IT TO </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) 93 STATE 107728  B) 93 COLOMBO 1850 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST--PLEASE SEE PARA 9. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  POST IS WORKING THROUGH </p><p>INTERMEDIARIES TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THE </p><p>LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) SHOULD </p><p>BECOME CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGED IN FINDING A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION TO SRI LANKA\'S ETHNIC CONFLICT.  WE ARE </p><p>CALLING ON THE LTTE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>FOCUS INITIALLY ON MODEST CONFIDENCE-BUILDING </p><p>MEASURES, RATHER THAN BROAD POLITICAL ISSUES.  USG </p><p>POLICY CONTINUES TO FAVOR A PEACEFUL POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH PRESERVES SRI LANKA\'S TERRITORIAL </p><p>INTEGRITY AND PROVIDES APPROPRIATE GUARANTEES FOR </p><p>MINORITY RIGHTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES </p><p>TO GET THE TALKING POINTS CONTAINED REF A (REPEATED </p><p>PARA 8) ACROSS TO THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL </p><p>EELAM (LTTE).  WE HAVE GIVEN THE MESSAGE TO A NUMBER </p><p>OF PROMINENT CITIZENS OF THE LTTE-CONTROLLED JAFFNA </p><p>PENINSULA WHO HAVE PASSED THROUGH COLOMBO IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS.  THEY INCLUDE ACADEMICIANS FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF JAFFNA, PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN CLERGY AND A LEADING DOCTOR FROM JAFFNA </p><p>HOSPITAL.  MOST RECENTLY, THE AMBASSADOR MET THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENT FROM JAFFNA, A TAMIL PUBLIC SERVANT </p><p>WHO MAINTAINS A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>TIGERS.  WE ALSO DELIVERED OUR POINTS TO A </p><p>JAFFNA-BOUND DELEGATION FROM THE UK-BASED "QUAKER </p><p>PEACE AND SERVICE" NGO. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERMEDIARIES IS </p><p>LIMITED BY THE RECLUSIVE NATURE OF THE LTTE </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND THE UNDERSTANDABLE RELUCTANCE OF </p><p>JAFFNA RESIDENTS TO MAKE WAVES WITH THE TIGERS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF DIRECT USG CONTACT WITH THE TIGERS, THIS </p><p>IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR GETTING OUR MESSAGE </p><p>ACROSS.  WE PLAN TO INTENSIFY THESE EFFORTS BY </p><p>SEEKING OUT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE ACCESS </p><p>TO (AND PERHAPS INFLUENCE WITH) THE LTTE.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE THE CATHOLIC BISHOP OF JAFFNA AND THE VICE </p><p>CHANCELLOR OF JAFFNA UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  IN ADDITION TO THE TALKING POINTS CONTAINED </p><p>REF A, WE ARE EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO BUILD </p><p>CREDIBILITY PRIOR TO ANY SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF </p><p>LARGER POLITICAL ISSUES.  IN OUR VIEW, THERE IS </p><p>CURRENTLY SUCH A LARGE RESERVOIR OF SUSPICION AND </p><p>MISTRUST BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LTTE THAT </p><p>HASTY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES COULD </p><p>ACTUALLY SET THE PEACE PROCESS BACK.  PUBLIC </p><p>POSTURING ASIDE, NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE LTTE </p><p>IS INTERESTED IN TALKS RIGHT NOW, UNLESS IT IS TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE TERMS OF THE OTHER SIDE\'S CAPITULATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  WE BELIEVE THAT ALL PARTIES--GOVERNMENT, </p><p>LTTE, AND NON-LTTE TAMILS--SHOULD FOCUS INITIALLY ON </p><p>PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING, LEAVING ASIDE THE LARGER </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES.  (A NOTE OF CAUTION:  WHILE WE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT THE LTTE IS THE ONLY TAMIL PLAYER </p><p>THAT MATTERS MILITARILY, WE DO NOT ACCEPT THE LTTE </p><p>AS THE SOLE SPOKESMAN OF THE TAMIL PEOPLE; AN </p><p>EVENTUAL POLITICAL SOLUTION WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT THE NON-TIGER TAMILS AS WELL AS THE LTTE.) </p><p>THESE CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES SHOULD BE </p><p>DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND UPHOLDING ANY </p><p>EVENTUAL AGREEMENT.  WE ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE GSL TO PUT INTO PRACTICE ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO DEVOLVE POWER AT THE PROVINCIAL AND </p><p>LOCAL LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (LOU  WITH THE ABOVE IN MIND, WE PLAN TO ADD THE </p><p>FOLOWING POINTS TO OUR "DIALOGUE" WITH THE LTTE: </p><p> </p><p>0 WE ENCOURAGE THE LTTE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS </p><p>SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>WAR.  THIS COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, GOODWILL </p><p>GESTURES SUCH AS PRISONER RELEASES, ALLOWING FREE </p><p>MOVEMENT OF CIVILIANS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>LTTE-CONTROLLED AREAS, OR A TEMPORARY, UNILATERAL </p><p>CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p>0  WE ENCOURAGE THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>SEARCH FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL AGREEMENT WHICH COULD </p><p>BE NEGOTIATED PRIOR TO ANY DISCUSSION OF LARGER </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES.  THESE COULD BE USED TO BUILD THE </p><p>CONFIDENCE NECESSARY FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE FUTURE </p><p>AGREEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (LOLL)  THE NEW TALKING POINTS WILL BE </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE POINTS WE HAVE BEEN USING </p><p>SINCE LAST YEAR: </p><p> </p><p>0  THE U.S. SUPPORTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO SRI </p><p>LANKA\'S ETHNIC PROBLEMS WHICH PRESERVES SRI LANKA AS </p><p>ONE COUNTRY AND PROVIDES MINORITIES WITH PROTECTION </p><p>AND DIGNITY. </p><p> </p><p>0  SRI LANKANS OF ALL ETHNIC GROUPS AND POLITICAL </p><p>PERSUASIONS NEED TO WORK OUT AMONG THEMSELVES THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WILL RESOLVE THIS </p><p>TRAGIC CONFLICT WHILE PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF </p><p>SRI LANKA AND THE RIGHT OF ITS PEOPLE TO LIVE IN </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>0  BOTH SIDES MUST BE WILLING TO DISCUSS ALL </p><p>RELEVANT ISSUES AND SEEK COMPROMISE.  NOTHING OF </p><p>IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE LEFT OFF THE TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>0  WE HAVE SPOKEN OUT VIGOROUSLY AGAINST GSL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ABUSES, AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>0  WE ALSO CONDEMN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY OTHERS, </p><p>NOTABLY THE LTTE.  WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST TERMS </p><p>THE LTTE\'S ATTACKS ON INNOCENT MUSLIM AND SINHALESE </p><p>CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  POST RECOMMENDS CONTINUATION OF OUR CURRENT </p><p>POLICY OF RESTRICTING SUBSTANTIVE CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>LTTE AND LTTE SYMPATHIZERS TO EMBASSY COLOMBO AND </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT.  IF OTHER MISSIONS ARE APPROACHED BY </p><p>LTTE REPRESENTATIVES OR PERSONS CLAIMING TO SPEAK ON </p><p>BEHALF OF THE LTTE, WE ASK THAT THEY SEEK GUIDANCE </p><p>FROM THE DEPARTMENT.  HOWEVER, SHOULD THE USDEL IN </p><p>GENEVA BE APPROACHED IN THE COURSE OF THE ONGOING </p><p>UNHRC MEETING BY TAMIL EXPATRIATE GROUPS SEEKING TO </p><p>PLEAD THEIR CAUSE, WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZE THE USDEL TO MAKE USE OF THE </p><p>ABOVE TALKING POINTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHAFFER </p><p></p></div>
