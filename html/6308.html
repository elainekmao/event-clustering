<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IO/EDA FOR WINNICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, FAOAORC, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO TERM LIMITS: OPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: LUCY TAMLYN, ALTERNATE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  THERE IS SHARP DIVISION IN THE OECD GROUP OVER </p><p>TRANSITION MEASURES ON THE APPLICABILITY OF TERM LIMITS FOR </p><p>THE CURRENT FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG). THE EU IS READY TO </p><p>ALLOW THE DG AN OPPORTUNITY TO RUN FOR A FOUR YEAR TERM </p><p>(NON-RENEWABLE) IN 2005 AS PART OF A PACKAGE WHICH WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE A CHANGE TO THE FAO BASIC TEXTS TO INTRODUCE TERM </p><p>LIMITS.  AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND DO NOT SUPPORT </p><p>ALLOWING THE INCUMBENT TO RUN AGAIN BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT A </p><p>SPECIFIC PROHIBITION MAY CAUSE THE G-77 TO BACK OFF SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERM LIMITS ALTOGETHER.  THE FRIENDS OF THE CHAIR MUST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01032  01 OF 02  130620Z </p><p>COME TO AGREEMENT SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR RISK </p><p>DEFERRING THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING AN AMENDMENT TO THE </p><p>FAO BASIC TEXT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE OECD GROUP MET ON MARCH 12 TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>APPROACHING MARCH 17 MEETING ON FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL TERM </p><p>LIMITS.  THE GREEK AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THE EU POSITION:  THE </p><p>EU SUPPORTS A FOUR YEAR TERM RENEWABLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR </p><p>YEARS.  AS A FALL-BACK THEY WOULD SUPPORT A SIX YEAR TERM </p><p>RENEWABLE FOR FOUR YEARS.  IN BOTH CASES THEY WOULD ALLOW THE </p><p>INCUMBENT TO RUN AGAIN AS A CANDIDATE FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEAR </p><p>TERM (NON-RENEWABLE). THE EU INTENDS TO MEET WITH REGIONAL </p><p>GROUPS TO "EXCHANGE VIEWS" BEFORE THE MARCH 17 MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE DELEGATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA REPORTED THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ASIAN GROUP LACKED A COMMON POSITION OVERALL, </p><p>MANY KEY COUNTRIES SUPPORTED A TERM OF FOUR YEARS RENEWABLE </p><p>ONCE (THAILAND, PHILIPPINES, INDIA).  NONETHELESS, THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE UNLIKELY TO BREAK RANKS IF THE LARGER G-77 </p><p>SOUGHT A LONGER TERM.  WHILE ASIAN GROUP MEMBERS DID NOT HAVE </p><p>A POSITION ON TRANSITIONAL MEASURES, KOREA NOTED THAT HE HAD </p><p>NEVER HEARD FROM ANY OF THOSE MEMBERS THAT THE INCUMBENT MUST </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO RUN AGAIN.  THE DELEGATE OF AUSTRALIA REPORTED </p><p>THAT HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH TWO KEY G-77 COUNTRIES, PAKISTAN </p><p>AND BRAZIL INDICATED THAT FOUR PLUS FOUR WAS "DEFINITELY </p><p>FEASIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE DELEGATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA ASKED THE EU IF </p><p>THEY WERE NOT WORRIED THAT THEIR POSITION ON TRANSITION </p><p>MEASURES "SENT A SIGNAL" CONCERNING THE 2005 ELECTIONS AND </p><p>POSSIBLE OECD SUPPORT FOR THE INCUMBENT WHICH WOULD AFFECT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01032  01 OF 02  130620Z </p><p>THE FIELD OF CANDIDATES AND THEIR POTENTIAL SUPPORT.  HE </p><p>ASKED IF IT MIGHT NOT BE BETTER TO HAVE AGREEMENT THAT THE DG </p><p>IS AN INCUMBENT LIKE ANY OTHER, RATHER THAN SINGLING HIM OUT </p><p>FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT. IN RESPONSE, THE EU EXPRESSED ITS </p><p>CONCERN THAT THIS APPROACH MIGHT ENCOURAGE THE DG TO RUN FOR </p><p>A FOURTH TERM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) U.S. DEL AGREED THAT WE SHOULD NOT SEND ANY SIGNAL </p><p>WHICH COULD BE INTERPRETED AS SUPPORT FOR A THIRD TERM AND </p><p>NOTED THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT THE EU BE MORE DIRECT WITH </p><p>G-77 INTERLOCUTORS CONCERNING THE EU DIRECTIVE BARRING EU </p><p>MEMBERS FROM VOTING FOR ANY INCUMBENT WHO HAS SERVED 12 </p><p>YEARS.  THE EU RESPONDED THAT THE EU DIRECTIVE WAS "NOT </p><p>GERMANE" AND THEY WOULD NOT RAISE IT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  U.S. DEL ALSO NOTED THAT THAT POLITICAL PRESSURE </p><p>NEEDED TO BE MUSTERED IN ORDER TO GET THE MESSAGE TO THE DG </p><p>THAT HE SHOULD NOT RUN AGAIN FOR A THIRD TERM.  SHE NOTED IN </p><p>THIS REGARD THE GENERALLY HELD VIEW THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN </p><p>FOUR MORE YEARS, AND WAS UNLIKELY TO RUN FOR A FOURTH TERM. </p><p>U.S. DEL WARNED THE EU THAT ITS CONSULTATIONS WITH REGIONAL </p><p>GROUPS SHOULD NOT RESULT IN THEM BRINGING A "FAIT ACCOMPLI" </p><p>TO THE TABLE ON MARCH 17 AS THIS WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FRIENDS OF THE CHAIR GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE DELEGATE OF CANADA OPINED THAT SILENCE ON THE </p><p>QUESTION OF TRANSITION MEASURES MIGHT BE PREFERABLE. IF THERE </p><p>WERE NO TRANSITIONAL MEASURES, THE GENERAL INTERPRETATION </p><p>WOULD BE THAT THE DG WAS FREE TO RUN LIKE ANY OTHER </p><p>CANDIDATE; THE OECD WOULD HAVE SENT NO SIGNAL ON WHETHER IT </p><p>WOULD CONDONE HIM SEEKING A THIRD TERM OR NOT.  IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01032  01 OF 02  130620Z </p><p>INTERIM BETWEEN THE DECISION IN 2003 AND THE ELECTIONS IN </p><p>2005, OECD MEMBERS COULD LOBBY AGAINST A DIOUF CANDIDACY. </p><p>THE DELEGATE OF AUSTRALIA WARNED THAT THE ABSENCE OF CLEARLY </p><p>LAID OUT TRANSITIONAL MEASURES (PRO OR CON) RAN THE RISK OF </p><p>CREATING CONFUSION AND FORCING THE ORGANIZATION TO CONTINUE </p><p>THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING THE QUESTION, THEREBY TYING UP </p><p>SCARCE RESOURCES.  NEW ZEALAND ARGUED THAT TERM LIMITS WAS A </p><p>"PACKAGE" AND THAT THE OECD WOULD HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP. </p><p>THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO GIVE UP THE MINIMUM  -- WHICH IN THIS </p><p>CASE APPEARED TO BE THE EU OPTION OF ALLOWING THE INCUMBENT A </p><p>FOUR YEAR TERM ONLY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: WE DO NOT EXPECT MORE THAN TWO MORE MEETINGS </p><p>(INCLUDING THE MARCH 17 MEETING) ON THIS ISSUE.  THE FRIENDS </p><p>OF THE CHAIR MUST COME TO AGREEMENT ON A PROPOSAL TO FORWARD </p><p>TO THE JUNE COUNCIL OR RISK DEFERRING THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>ACHIEVING AN AMENDMENT TO THE FAO BASIC TEXTS FOR ANOTHER </p><p>FOUR YEARS.  ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO JOIN THE EU IN SUPPORTING </p><p>AN AMENDMENT TO THE BASIC TEXT TO ALLOW FOR FOUR TERMS </p><p>RENEWABLE ONCE WITH EXPLICIT MEASURES STATING THAT THE DG MAY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0331 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01032  02 OF 02  130620Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  EB-00    EUR-00   TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   SS-00    SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------438CB0  130620Z /38 </p><p>O 130514Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8706 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IO/EDA FOR WINNICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO TERM LIMITS: OPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>RUN AGAIN FOR A FOUR YEAR TERM.  ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE AN </p><p>AMENDMENT TO THE BASIC TEXTS TO ALLOW FOR FOUR YEARS </p><p>RENEWABLE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DG HAS THE SAME </p><p>RIGHTS AS ANY OTHER NEW CANDIDATE (EITHER EXPLICITLY OR BY </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF ANY "TRANSITION MEASURES").  THE FIRST OPTION </p><p>HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF ATTAINABILITY AND SIMPLICITY: THE </p><p>DRAWBACK IS THAT IT PRACTICALLY INVITES THE DG TO SPEND </p><p>ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IN THE JOB; THE SECOND OPTION RUNS THE </p><p>RISK (WHICH WE JUDGE SMALL) OF HIM SPENDING ANOTHER EIGHT </p><p>YEARS IN THE JOB.  IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF NOT SENDING ANY </p><p>SIGNALS ON MEMBER SUPPORT WHICH MIGHT DETER POSSIBLE </p><p>CANDIDATES FROM SEEKING THE POSITION.
