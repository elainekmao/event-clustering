<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000853 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DRL </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  KILLERS OF TWO MAOIST STUDENTS REMAIN </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0795 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0770 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Although the Maoist-affiliated student union </p><p>continues to blame the security forces for the killings of </p><p>two of its members in April, most human rights groups and </p><p>mainstream politicians from the area believe that the pair </p><p>were likely murdered by others in the insurgents\' student </p><p>wing.  Some senior police officials, on the other hand, have </p><p>suggested that the two may have been killed because of local </p><p>anti-Maoist vigilantism.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>DECAPITATED STUDENT BODIES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The leadership of the Maoist-affiliated All-Nepal </p><p>National Independent Student Union - Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>has accused the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) of killing ANNISU-R </p><p>members Bhupendra Timilsena and Prit Kumar Moktan in the city </p><p>of Hetauda in the south-central district of Makwanpur.  The </p><p>decapitated body of Timilsena was found in Hetauda on April </p><p>20, while the headless and mutilated corpse of Moktan was </p><p>discovered one week later (Ref A).  The two had been reported </p><p>missing on April 20 after having been arrested, the ANNISU-R </p><p>alleged, by RNA soldiers.  A third student who had </p><p>disappeared at the same time, Ramesh Sapkota, remains </p><p>missing.  The ANNISU-R called an April 29 general strike, or </p><p>bandh, to protest the killings (Ref B).  Findings from an </p><p>investigation into the incidents, conducted under Home </p><p>Ministry auspices, were forwarded to the Home Minister on May </p><p>8, according to Ministry Joint Secretary Naranjan Baral.  He </p><p>declined to disclose the results of the investigation until </p><p>after the Minister has had a chance to review it. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>INTRA-PARTY STRIFE, LOCAL REVENGE </p><p>SUGGESTED AS POSSIBLE MOTIVES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Human rights groups, local polticians, and police </p><p>cast doubt on the ANNISU-R version of events.  Krishna Gautam </p><p>of national human rights NGO INSEC (affiliated with the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist, the </p><p>largest political party) questioned ANNISU-R allegations that </p><p>the pair had been arrested by the RNA.  Instead, Gautam said, </p><p>local residents believe that the two had more likely been </p><p>detained and killed by villagers angered by the insurgent </p><p>students\' past behavior.  (Note:  Senior police officials in </p><p>Kathmandu have offered the same theory.  End note.)  A local </p><p>reporter based in Hetauda said that none of the villagers </p><p>reported having seen the students with the RNA.  Hiranya Lal </p><p>Shrestha, a member of the Communist Party of Nepal - Marxist </p><p>Leninist and former Member of Parliament from Makwanpur, </p><p>speculated that the two may have been killed because of </p><p>internal rivalries within the Maoist camp.  Alternatively, he </p><p>suggested that the students could have been killed by gangs </p><p>involved in smuggling marijuana from Makwanpur to India who </p><p>were angered at the Maoist tax on contraband marijuana. </p><p>Chief District Officer Pashupati Karmacharya said he was "100 </p><p>percent sure" that the Maoists themselves killed the two </p><p>students, alleging the two had a dispute about "money </p><p>matters" with their fellow cadres before their </p><p>disappearances.  He added that the RNA would have been more </p><p>likely to shoot the students than to take the trouble of </p><p>decapitating them.  Superintendent of Police Narayan Prasad </p><p>Bastakoti of the District Police Office stated that an </p><p>investigation into the two murders is ongoing.  The general </p><p>public now realizes that neither the police nor the RNA was </p><p>involved in the killings, he asserted, echoing others\' </p><p>speculation that the two were either killed by other Maoists </p><p>or by members of a criminal gang.  The local chapter of </p><p>Amnesty International said it had no information on the </p><p>incident, while the National Human Rights Commission said it </p><p>had not received any complaints regarding the killings and </p><p>had thus not begun an investigation. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The ANNISU-R, which had initially tried to exploit </p><p>the grisly killings as an example of RNA brutality, has been </p><p>uncharacteristically silent since the beginning of May, </p><p>likely put off by widespread public skepticism--if not </p><p>outright hostility.  We find it particularly telling that </p><p>local residents, who presumably knew the murder victims best, </p><p>do not appear particularly sympathetic to the ANNISU-R </p><p>version of events.  While we doubt that the just-concluded </p><p>inquiry by the Home Ministry will turn up much reliable </p><p>information either to implicate or exonerate any of the </p><p>alleged killers, the Maoists\' sensationalist charges against </p><p>the RNA appear to have died a natural death. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
