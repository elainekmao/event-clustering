<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 004749 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/25/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIEW FROM ZIMBABWE ON DROC ISSUES DISCUSSED IN </p><p>MAPUTO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB. TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04749  251442Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SPOKE TO FORMER INDUSTRY AND </p><p>COMMERCE MINISTER NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA ABOUT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S CONGOLESE DISCUSSIONS WITH REGIONAL LEADERS IN </p><p>MAPUTO AUGUST 20-23.  SHAMUYARIRA, WHO EARLIER IN HIS </p><p>CAREER WAS FOREIGN MINISTER AND IS STILL IN CLOSE </p><p>COUNSEL WITH MUGABE, PROVIDED A BRIEF READOUT OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S ONE-ON-ONE MEETING (WITH NO NOTETAKERS) WITH </p><p>UGANDAN PRESIDENT MUSEVENI AND OTHERS.  SHAMUYARIRA, WHO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED THE PRESIDENT TO MAPUTO BUT WAS NOT PRESENT </p><p>AT ANY OF THE RELEVANT MEETINGS, CONVEYED MUGABE\'S VIEW </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS NOW BEING MORE FLEXIBLE AND </p><p>WILL HELP GET THE LUSAKA ACCORDS BACK ON TRACK. </p><p>APPARENTLY, KABILA WILL PERMIT THE MONUC DEPLOYMENT IN </p><p>CONGOLESE TERRITORY AS THE FIRST CONCRETE STEP IN </p><p>REVIVING THE ACCORDS.  ADDITIONALLY, POSITIVE ACTION BY </p><p>RWANDA AND UGANDA COULD BRING REBEL OFFENSIVES TO AN </p><p>END.  SHAMUYARIRA FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE ROLE OF </p><p>MASIRE AS FACILITATOR IS STILL A POINT OF CONTENTION, SO </p><p>OTHER LEADERS WERE BEING CONSIDERED, INCLUDING NELSON </p><p>MANDELA.  HE THOUGHT THAT KABILA WAS OPEN TO MANDELA </p><p>ASSUMING THE FACILITATOR ROLE AND THAT THE FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS ALSO INTERESTED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: SHAMUYARIRA\'S BELIEF (AND PRESUMABLY </p><p>MUGABE\'S) THAT KABILA WILL TAKE THESE NECESSARY STEPS TO </p><p>REVIVE LUSAKA IS SOMEWHAT OVERLY OPTIMISTIC AT THIS </p><p>POINT.  GIVEN KABILA\'S OPEN AND WELL KNOWN DISLIKE OF </p><p>MANDELA, IT IS HARD FOR US TO THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL </p><p>POSSIBILITY.  HOWEVER, MUGABE\'S CONTINUING STRONG FOCUS </p><p>ON SEEKING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE DROC WAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04749  251442Z </p><p>UNDERSCORES HIS DESIRE TO WITHDRAW THE TROOP DEPLOYMENT </p><p>THAT HIS COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: PROCEDURALLY, IT IS </p><p>INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NO ONE FROM THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY WAS INVOLVED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS IN MAPUTO AND </p><p>NO ONE AT MFA KNEW ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE ABOUT THEM WHEN </p><p>WE INQUIRED TODAY.  IT SOUNDS LIKE SHAMUYARIRA WILL BE </p><p>PLAYING THE ROLE OF SPECIAL ADVISOR ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.  THE FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER MAY </p><p>NOW FUNCTION LIKE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA ON SUCH WEIGHTY MATTERS.  HE TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE IS ACCOMPANYING MUGABE ON HIS TRIP TO </p><p>LIBYA, WHICH BEGINS ON AUGUST 27 OR 28.  SHAMUYARIRA </p><p>AGREED TO GIVE THE AMBASSADOR A READOUT ON THESE ISSUES </p><p>WHEN HE RETURNS FROM TRIPOLI LATER NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
