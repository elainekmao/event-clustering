<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, KPKO, SL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN ARMY TROOP ROTATION COMPLETELY CANCELLED </p><p> </p><p>REF: IIR 6 871 0371 01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classification derived from IIR 6 871 0371 01; Reason 1.6X1. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is IIR 6 871 0371 01, repeated through State </p><p>Channels to ensure wider distribution outside of DOD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) Summary: Nigerian army staff stated that latest </p><p>troop rotation cancelled. Elements of one battalion that had </p><p>begun to move to Sierra Leone will be recalled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) According to Colonel Operations, Colonel D. Kaka, </p><p>of the Nigerian Army Staff, the troop rotation plan involving </p><p>73 and 65 battalions, switching with 5 and 130 battalions has </p><p>been summarily cancelled.  Kaka stated that elements of the </p><p>65 battalion had already begun to rotate but that these </p><p>personnel would return to Nigeria shortly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) Kaka clearly was confused regarding the </p><p>cancellation, literally throwing his hands in the air over </p><p>the decision to cancel while part of a unit was already </p><p>deployed (field comment - ironically, Kaka requested that RO </p><p>find out from the Nigerian Government what was going on). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) Field Comments: For several weeks, RO has updated </p><p>Kaka on the UN/US rotation plan in the wake of the Nigerian </p><p>Presidents decision to support the change.  The original </p><p>rotation plan was changed twice in the last few weeks by </p><p>UN/US planners.  While the first change (both battalions to </p><p>rotate in January) was accepted by the President, the </p><p>Nigerian Army had not gotten any word one way or the other. </p><p>The waters became muddier when we suggested a further change </p><p>(one battalion to rotate out in September and be replaced by </p><p>the Senegalese, and the second battalion to rotate in </p><p>January).  Emboffs made calls on Minister of state for Army </p><p>Lawal Batagarawa explaining the changes and the fact that the </p><p>Army did not know about them and was proceeding with original </p><p>rotation plans. The Nigerian army now apparently has chosen </p><p>to cancel the rotation completely and leave the 5 and 130 </p><p>battalions in Sierra Leone until the situation clarifies or </p><p>the Operation Focus Relief phase three units are ready to </p><p>deploy in December/January timeframe.  The fact that source </p><p>has requested RO to provide him information on what his own </p><p>government is doing is indicative of sources frustration with </p><p>the Nigerian bureaucracy and slowness to respond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>end text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) CDA is seeking an appointment with Minister of Defense </p><p>Danjuma for Tuesday, September 25, to try to put the rotation </p><p>issue back on track. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
