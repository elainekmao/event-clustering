<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001857 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, IR, BM, CG, ZI, KN, NL, UNGA, UNHRC-1, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH:  SUMMARY OF EU THOUGHTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 197183 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 206381 </p><p>     C. 7/18 CARTER PERRY-WITMER-HUNT EMAILS (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Mary E. Daly Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Following delivery of HR reftels on July 21, MFA </p><p>Senior Policy Advisor for Human Rights, Hans Docter (protect </p><p>source), confirmed that the EU will introduce UNGA </p><p>resolutions on Burma and the DRC; a decision on Iran has been </p><p>postponed until early September, but appears likely.  Docter </p><p>also shared EU concerns on Guantanamo, U.S.-EU relations on </p><p>HR issues, and EU thinking on the reform of UN human rights </p><p>system.  He also recommended holding high-level U.S.-EU </p><p>consultations on human rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNGA - Iran, Burma, DRC, Zimbabwe, North Korea </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The EU recently agreed internally to wait until early </p><p>September to make a final decision on an Iran resolution. </p><p>The Dutch strongly favor a resolution, and Docter commented </p><p>that there is much greater support for one this year than </p><p>last year.  Barring any major improvement in the human rights </p><p>situation between now and September, Docter is "fairly </p><p>confident" that the EU will introduce a resolution on Iran. </p><p>The EU will introduce resolutions on Burma and the DRC.  The </p><p>Dutch would also like to see an EU-sponsored resolution on </p><p>Zimbabwe, but internal disagreements, especially by the </p><p>French, remain.  (Note:  The Dutch appear willing, if the </p><p>U.S. agrees, to work with the U.S. in encouraging specific </p><p>African countries to introduce a Zimbabwe resolution.  End </p><p>note.)   Docter brought up the subject of North Korea, noting </p><p>that the EU is waiting and watching to see what the US and </p><p>Japan will do. </p><p> </p><p>Guantanamo </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Docter broached the situation in Guantanamo, stating </p><p>that the EU remains concerned over the lack of information </p><p>about the status of the prisoners.  (Note:  The MFA </p><p>highlights this topic in every discussion involving human </p><p>rights.  The issue remains popular in the Dutch press and </p><p>with members of Parliament. End Note.)  While the Dutch are </p><p>not calling into question the treatment of the prisoners, the </p><p>GoNL shares EU concerns about prisoner access to due process, </p><p>the possibility of closed trials, and the death penalty. </p><p>Docter opined that if the U.S. agreed to exclude the </p><p>possibility of a death penalty sentence, EU interest and </p><p>concerns would greatly decrease. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU:  U.S. Needs To Do More </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In an informal meeting of EU human rights advisors on </p><p>July 19 in Venice, Docter stated there was obvious resentment </p><p>of the U.S.  Many EU member states are of the opinion that </p><p>the U.S. pressures Europe into taking on "the major HR </p><p>issues," but later "takes all the credit" for hard-fought EU </p><p>successes.  At the same time, the U.S. does not adequately </p><p>support issues of importance to the EU.  The Dutch disagree </p><p>with this assessment.  Nevertheless, Docter commented that if </p><p>the U.S. were more supportive of the EU on, for example, </p><p>Turkmenistan and Chechnya, such EU resentment would likely </p><p>diminish.  Docter also suggested the U.S. approach the EU </p><p>Presidency to propose high-level U.S.-EU human rights talks. </p><p>U.S. officials might then also visit influential EU capitals, </p><p>as occurred in preparation for last year\'s UNCHR. </p><p> </p><p>Reform of UN Human Rights System </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Docter said the EU is looking at ways in which to </p><p>reform how the UN approaches human rights.  No decisions have </p><p>been made to date.  However, discussion includes doing away </p><p>with the UNCHR, leaving the third committee in charge of </p><p>dealing with HR issues.  The EU is also internally assessing </p><p>how the UN could increase cooperation and the operational </p><p>effectiveness of UN agencies already dealing with aspects of </p><p>human rights. (Note:  The Dutch will serve on the next UNCHR. </p><p> End Note.) </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
