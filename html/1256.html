(C) SUMMARY: THE AMBASSADOR, ECON AND NEW POL </p><p>OFFICER MADE AN INTRODUCTORY CALL ON SIMBA MAKONI, THE </p><p>RECENTLY APPOINTED FINANCE MINISTER ON AUGUST 22. </p><p>MAKONI (WHOM THE EMBASSY KNOWS WELL) SHARED WITH US </p><p>HIS DETERMINATION TO BE A FORCE FOR POSITIVE CHANGE </p><p>AND PAINTED A NEW PICTURE OF THE POST-ELECTION CABINET </p><p>AS A TEAM GIVEN THE BRIEF BY PRESIDENT MUGABE TO "GET </p><p>ZIMBABWE WORKING AGAIN."  ON THE LAND ISSUE HE TOLD US </p><p>"TO ONLY BELIEVE WHAT WE SEE."  THE NEW MINISTER </p><p>EXPRESSED SERIOUS INTEREST IN THE STATUS AND OUTLOOK </p><p>OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT, AND PLEADED FOR </p><p>IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CLEAR USG SUPPORT </p><p>GOING AHEAD.  HIS MESSAGE WAS STAND BY US, AND JUDGE </p><p>ZIMBABWE ON ITS DEEDS, NOT ITS RHETORIC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN AN AUGUST 22 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEW </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, ACCOMPANIED BY ECON AND </p><p>POL OFFICERS, THE AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED THE TOUGH </p><p>PORTFOLIO AND CHALLENGES FACING THE NEW CABINET </p><p>MEMBER, AND CRITICAL ISSUES ON THE PATH AHEAD.  THE </p><p>COM AND OTHER SENIOR EMBASSY STAFF KNOW MAKONI WELL </p><p>FROM HIS PRIOR PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS </p><p>OVER THE YEARS, AND IN THE MEETING MAKONI WAS WARM AND </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH US. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04692  01 OF 02  241454Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE WAY AHEAD WITH A NEW CABINET </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHEN ASKED HOW HE VIEWED THE WAY FORWARD, </p><p>MAKONI DECLARED THAT DETERMINING WHAT TO DO WAS NOT </p><p>THE CHALLENGE, BUT RATHER WHEN, HOW AND WHETHER TO </p><p>CARRY OUT THE HARD STEPS NECESSARY TO TURN AROUND THE </p><p>DECLINE.  HOW FAR TO PUSH WAS A DELICATE ISSUE, THE </p><p>MINSTER TOLD US, AND HE HAD SPENT MUCH OF THE LAST FEW </p><p>WEEKS (MAKONI HAD BEEN SWORN IN 4 WEEKS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>DAY OF OUR CALL) BEING BREIFED BY SENIOR MINISTRY </p><p>STAFF AND LEARNING IN THE PROCESS THAT THE "JOB IS </p><p>LESS ABOUT FINANCE, THAN IT IS ABOUT POLITICS."   THE </p><p>NEW CABINET, IN MAKONI\'S VIEW, CONSTITUTES A TEAM THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN TASKED BY THE PRESIDENT TO GET RESULTS.  HE </p><p>IS DEDICATED TO THIS GOAL, AND TOLD US THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>IS IN THE TOUGH SPOT OF NEEDING FOREIGN HELP TO GET </p><p>OUT OF ITS PREDICAMENT; BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE KNEW </p><p>THAT HELP WOULD ONLY COME WHEN CLEAR PROGRESS HAD BEEN </p><p>MADE.  "WE WILL START THE CHANGE," HE STATED, "AND YOU </p><p>CAN JUDGE US BY OUR DEEDS AND NOT OUR WORDS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>WE NEED A SOFT BELLY TO LAND ON, AND ASK FOR ANY HELP </p><p>YOU CAN PROVIDE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CONTINUING IN THIS SAME VEIN THE MINISTER </p><p>STATED THAT THE CRITICAL ISSUE FACING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS TO REIN IN AND ELIMINATE LAWLESSNESS, AND THEREBY </p><p>WIN BACK THE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST OF THE PEOPLE, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ONLY IF THIS IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04692  01 OF 02  241454Z </p><p>DONE CAN NORMALCY RETURN, AND EFFORTS CAN THEN BE MADE </p><p>TO STEM THE ECONOMIC DECLINE.  MAKONI EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THERE WERE NO SACRED COWS IN THIS EFFORT.  THE </p><p>DEVALUATION SHOWED THIS AND THE SPENDING CUTS THAT ARE </p><p>TO ENSUE WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE THIS BY DEED.  MAKONI </p><p>STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORMULATING A PLAN TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE RUNAWAY INFLATION RATE, WHICH HE HOPED TO </p><p>HAVE FINALIZED BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEW </p><p>BUDGET LATER THIS YEAR.  HE TOLD US BLUNTLY THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WANTED OUT OF THE CONGO, AND THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ASSURED HIM THAT THE U.S. FULLY SUPPORTED WITHDRAWAL </p><p>AND WAS DOING ALL IT COULD TO ACHIEVE THIS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE NEW MINISTER IF THE </p><p>GOZ WOULD GO AHEAD WITH ITS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SEIZE </p><p>3,000 COMMERCIAL FARMS BEFORE THE START OF THE RAINY </p><p>SEASON.  MAKONI POINTEDLY REPLIED THAT WE SHOULD "ONLY </p><p>BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE," CLEARLY IMPLYING THAT THE </p><p>SEIZURES AND RESETTLEMENT MAY WELL FALL SHORT OF THE </p><p>3,000 MARK.  MAKONI FURTHER REMARKED THAT CLARITY WILL </p><p>COME TO THE LAND ISSUE, AS IT IS SOMETHING ALL IN THE </p><p>NATION NEED.

"IF I CANNOT DO THAT JOB, I WILL NOT </p><p>BLAME IT ON THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE IT WILL BE MY FAULT </p><p>OR THE FAULT OF THE TEAM," HE PASSIONATELY STATED. </p><p>"WE WILL SINK OR SWIM TOGETHER, AND I THINK THIS IS </p><p>STARTING TO BE REALIZED," MAKONI ASSURED US. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN CLOSING, THE MINISTER ASKED US WITH NOTABLE </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE STATUS, IMPACT AND OUTLOOK FOR THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED OUR </p><p>PRESENT DOMESTIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND PROVIDED </p><p>AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT ACTION COULD TAKE PLACE, HOW AND </p><p>WHY.  HE STATED THAT THE EMBASSY SHARED CONGRESS\' </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN ZIMBABWE.  WE </p><p>EXPLAINED TO THE FINANCE MINISTER THE KEY ROLE THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER\'S UPCOMING VISIT TO WASHINGTON COULD </p><p>PLAY, AND INFORMED HIM THAT WE WERE WILLING TO BRIEF </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINSTER AND OTHER GOZ OFFICIALS BEFORE </p><p>THEIR TRIP.  IN HIS FINAL WORDS THE NEW FINANCE CHIEF </p><p>ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THE UNITED </p><p>STATES COULD PROVIDE ZIMBABWE TO HELP IT THROUGH ITS </p><p>PRESENT DIFFICULT TIMES.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE IS SO </p><p>SHORT, HE EXPLAINED, THAT IT IS A STRUGGLE TO EVEN </p><p>COME UP WITH USD 2 MILLION TO GET SMALL AMOUNTS OF </p><p>FUEL IMPORTED.  ANYTHING WE COULD PROVIDE "THAT\'S NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04692  02 OF 02  241454Z </p><p>TIED TO THE BIG PICTURE" WOULD BE VERY MUCH </p><p>APPRECIATED.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THE NATURE, </p><p>AMOUNTS AND LIMITS ON OUR AID TO ZIMBABWE AND LET THE </p><p>NEW MINISTER DOWN GENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THOUGH WE KNOW MAKONI FAIRLY WELL, THIS </p><p>INITIAL MEETING IN HIS NEW OFFICES WAS DIFFERENT THAN </p><p>OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS WHEN HE WAS BUSINESSMAN </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANT POST THE MINISTER HOLDS. </p><p>WHILE MAKONI WAS SCANT ON DETAILS OF THE MINISTRY\'S </p><p>POLICIES GOING FORWARD (A FAULT SHARED BY THE </p><p>MILLENIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN), HE WAS HONEST, </p><p>LISTENED CAREFULLY AND MADE HIS PITCH FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITHOUT SUSPENDING CRITICISM OR IGNORING REALITY.  WE </p><p>LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM AND HOPE THAT HIS </p><p>WORDS AND VISION ARE MADE REAL.  THE EMBASSY DOES WANT </p><p>TO HELP THIS MINISTER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
