<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 07104 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, LE, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  CONTINUED WAR FOR THE PALESTINIAN CAMPS -- </p><p>          ANOTHER SYRIAN FAILURE? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) BEIRUT 6526, B) DAMASCUS 7043 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  AS REFTELS POINT OUT, SYRIA APPEARS TO BE </p><p>FACING A SUBSTANTIAL DEFEAT IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO QUICKLY </p><p>AND RESOLUTELY RESOLVE THE LATEST ROUND IN THE "WAR OF </p><p>THE CAMPS" IN LEBANON.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS </p><p>LATEST ROUND OF FIGHTING ALREADY REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>FAILURE OF SYRIAN POLICY WHICH THREATENS TO ERODE </p><p>DAMASCUS\' STRATEGY TOWARDS THE PALESTINIANS AND ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO SABOTAGE THE PALESTINIAN RECONCILIATION </p><p>PROCESS NOW GOING ON.  FURTHER IT DAMAGES SYRIA\'S IMAGE </p><p>WITHIN THE ARAB AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONTRIBUTES TO DISSENT WITHIN THE POLICY- </p><p>MAKING PROCESS IN DAMASCUS ITSELF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE CONCUR WITH EMBASSY BEIRUT (REFTEL) THAT THE </p><p>CONTINUED FIGHTING BETWEEN AMAL AND THE PALESTINIANS, IN </p><p>WHICH AMAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SADLY DEFICIENT, </p><p>REPRESENTS A MAJOR DILEMMA FOR SYRIAN POLICY-MAKERS. </p><p>INDEED, WE WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY THAT THE FAILURE TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE FIGHTING AT THIS POINT ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE </p><p>TO AMAL AND THE SYRIANS ALREADY REPRESENTS A SEVERE </p><p>SYRIAN DEFEAT AND THREATENS TO FURTHER UNRAVEL DAMASCUS\' </p><p>ALREADY DISINTEGRATING PALESTINIAN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>4.  A JORDANIAN JOURNALIST WITH EXCELLENT PALESTINIAN </p><p>CONTACTS HAS TOLD US THAT IN THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>FOR A CEASEFIRE, THE PFLP -- THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE </p><p>SYRIAN-BACKED PNSF WITH SUBSTANTIAL POPULAR SUPPORT AMONG </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS -- HAS TAKEN A DECIDEDLY ANTI-SYRIAN </p><p>LINE AND HAS SPLIT WITH THE MORE TRACTABLE PRO-SYRIAN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE ABU MUSA FATAH GROUP, THE </p><p>PFLP-GC, AND SAIQA.  ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, THE PFLP </p><p>IS NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, THE DFLP, FATAH AND </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE CAMPS. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE PFLP NEGOTIATORS REFUSE TO TURN OVER </p><p>TERRITORIES GAINED IN THE SIDON AREA TO ANYONE BUT </p><p>MUSTAFA SA\'ID\'S POPULAR NASSARISTS MOVEMENT.  THE SCENARIO </p><p>WE HAVE RECEIVED OF NEGOTIATIONS POSITS GREAT BITTERNESS </p><p>BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AS A WHOLE ON THE ONE HAND AND </p><p>NABIH BERRI AND THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER, AS </p><p>WELL AS A GREAT DEAL OF BACK-BITING WITHIN BOTH THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN AND LEBANESE GROUPINGS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE MILITARY FAILURE ON THE GROUND IN LEBANON IS NOT </p><p>DAMASCUS\' ONLY DILEMMA.  AS IN PREVIOUS SYRIAN EFFORTS TO </p><p>SUBJUGATE THE PALESTINIANS IN THE LEBANESE REFUGEE CAMPS </p><p>THROUGH THE USE OF DAMASCUS\' AMAL SURROGATE, THE LATEST </p><p>FIGHTING HAS CREATED GREAT BITTERNESS AMONG OTHER ARAB </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  DAMASCUS IS PRESENTLY OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN </p><p>HOST TO A VARIETY OF SENIOR ARAB AND ISLAMIC ENVOYS -- </p><p>ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER IBRAHIMI, LIBYA\'S MAJOR JALLUD, </p><p>SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE NAIF, AND A NUMBER OF </p><p>SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIALS.  WHILE JALLUD AND THE IRANIANS </p><p>HAVE BECOME PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE PALESTINIAN/LEBAN- </p><p>ESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH THE ALGERIAN </p><p>AND THE SAUDI DELIVERED TOUGH MESSAGES TO ASAD REGARDING </p><p>THIS LATEST ASSAULT ON THE PALESTINIANS.  THE SYRIANS MAY </p><p>HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SOME SMALL COMFORT IN THE ANNOUNCE- </p><p>MENT BY THE "PAN-ARAB COMMAND" CALLING FOR SOLIDARITY WITH </p><p>SYRIA AGAINST THE AMERICAN, BRITISH AND ISRAELI </p><p>CONSPIRACY AGAINST IT, SUPPORT FOR AMAL, AND A REDEFINI- </p><p>TION OF THE PALESTINIAN ROLE IN LEBANON.  THIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS, HOWEVER, ONE OF LITTLE STANDING AMONG </p><p>THE ARAB STATES AS A WHOLE, TO SAY THE LEAST, AND IS </p><p>LARGELY A SYRIAN-LIBYAN CREATURE.  INDEED, EVEN THIS MINOR </p><p>"VICTORY" AND JALLUD\'S VERY CAREFUL STATEMENT OF </p><p>MEASURED SUPPORT HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTED BY LIBYAN LEADER </p><p>MO\'AMMAR QADHAFI\'S LATEST BLAST CONDEMNING AMAL. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>6.  AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, NOT ALL THE LEBANESE GATHERED </p><p>HERE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF SYRIA EITHER.  WHILE NONE </p><p>WANT TO SEE THE RECREATION OF THE PALESTINIAN "STATE- </p><p>WITHIN-A-STATE" IN LEBANON, FEW ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>SYRIA THAT THIS TYPE OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE CAMPS </p><p>IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE LEBANESE.  AS THEY SEE IT, </p><p>LEBANESE MILITIAS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SYRIA\'S WORK FOR </p><p>IT AND TO SHOULDER THE BLAME WITHIN THE ARAB COMMUNITY. </p><p>DRUSE LEADER WALID JUMBLATT, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, FEELS </p><p>PARTICULARLY SQUEEZED.  AMAL\'S SH\'IA RIVALS, HIZBALLAH, </p><p>ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN NEGOTIATIONS, AND, AS IN THE </p><p>PAST, HAVE REFRAINED FROM GETTING INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>FIGHTING.  AT THE SAME TIME, HIZBALLAH\'S IRANIAN MENTORS </p><p>ARE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE HERE.  OF INTEREST, PALESTINIANS </p><p>TOLD OUR JORDANIAN SOURCE THAT SHAYKHOLESLAM EXPRESSED </p><p>DEEP SYMPATHY FOR THE PALESTINIAN POSITION WHEN MEETING </p><p>WITH PNSF LEADERS ON NOVEMBER 24.  ON THE EVENING OF </p><p>NOVEMBER 27, HOWEVER, SHAYKHOLESLAM RETURNED TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP COLDLY BEARING BERRI\'S PROPOSALS. </p><p>WE DO NOT, NEVERTHELESS, BELIEVE THAT IRAN\'S BASIC </p><p>DISAGREEMENT WITH THE SYRIAN STRATEGY TOWARDS LEBANON </p><p>HAS CHANGED IN ANY WAY.  THEY WANT TO TAKE ASAD\'S </p><p>"LEBANESE CARD" AWAY FROM HIM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE PNSF LEADERS BLINDLY LOYAL </p><p>TO DAMASCUS DO NOT HAVE ANY REAL ABILITY TO DELIVER THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS IN THE TYRE, SIDON, OR BEIRUT </p><p>CAMPS.  WHAT IS NOW AT STAKE FOR DAMASCUS IS NOT MERELY </p><p>AN EMBARRASSMENT THROUGH A MILITARY DEFEAT FOR ITS </p><p>LEBANESE SURROGATES.  RATHER, SYRIA IS FACED WITH BITTER </p><p>DIVISIONS WITHIN ITS OWN UMBRELLA PALESTINIAN ORGANIZA- </p><p>TION THAT COULD FINALLY TEAR IT APART, LEAVING A RUMP OF </p><p>"YES-MEN" WITH NO BROAD PALESTINIAN POPULAR SUPPORT. </p><p>SYRIA COULD LOSE ITS "PALESTINIAN CARD." </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>8.  THIS PARALLELS THE CURRENT STAGES OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORT, WITH PFLP LEADER GEORGE HABASH </p><p>NOW IN THE THIRD ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH FATAH </p><p>NUMBER TWO MAN KHALIL AL-WAZIR IN ALGIERS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>HABASH CONTINUES TO HOLD OUT FOR HIS DEMANDS THAT </p><p>INCLUDE PRIOR  ABROGATION OF THE AMMAN ACCORDS, </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADEN-ALGIERS AGREEMENTS, AND PLO </p><p>BREAKING OFF ITS CONTACTS WITH EGYPT, THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE IS DEEPLY DISTURBING TO DAMASCUS. </p><p>KHALID FAHOUM HAS TOLD WESTERN DIPLOMATS THAT THE SYRIANS </p><p>HAVE INFORMED THE DAMASCUS-BASED PALESTINIANS THAT ANY </p><p>OF THEM ATTENDING AN ALGERIAN PNC WILL NOT BE PERMITTED </p><p>TO RETURN TO SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  THE CAMPS WAR REPRESENTS A MULTIFACETED, </p><p>COMPLEX DILEMMA FOR DAMASCUS.  ITS IMPACT IS NOT MERELY </p><p>ONE OF SYRIAN PRESTIGE AND SUPPORT OF ITS AMAL ALLY. </p><p>IT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ASAD\'S PALESTINIAN </p><p>POLICY, HIS IMAGE WITHIN THE ARAB WORLD, AND HIS PERSONAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ARAB AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL - INCLUDING </p><p>SOVIET - LEADERS.  CLOSER TO HOME, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE </p><p>IS INTENSE INTERNAL DEBATE AMONG ASAD\'S LIEUTENANTS </p><p>AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE CAMPS WAR AND LEBANON </p><p>AS A WHOLE.  THUS FAR, ASAD DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A GRIP </p><p>ON THE SITUATION.  THE LONGER THIS REMAINS THE CASE, THE </p><p>MORE ROOM HIS LIEUTENANTS WILL HAVE TO MANEUVER AND TO </p><p>INTRIGUE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.  SEVERAL KEY SYRIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS, AMONG THEM VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM AND MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF ALI DUBA, HAVE GREAT PERSONAL </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE EVOLUTION OF SYRIA\'S LEBANESE AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN POLICIES.  FAILURE IS NOT USUALLY PERMITTED </p><p>BY DAMASCUS UNDER ASAD.  HOWEVER, AS WE LOOK AROUND HERE, </p><p>FAILURE SEEMS TO BE BECOMING AN INCREASING PHENOMENA </p><p>WITHIN SYRIAN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>RANSOM </p><p></p></div>
