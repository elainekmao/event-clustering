<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 002676 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356:DECL:07/12/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, ECON, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  HIZBALLAH AND HARIRI STRIKE A DEAL </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  PM HARIRI, SPEAKER BIRRI, </p><p>AND SHI\'A SPIRITUAL LEADER SHAMS AD-DIN MET JULY 11 </p><p>AND RESOLVED DIFFERENCES OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF TWO </p><p>SHI\'A-RESERVED SEATS ON THE BOARD OF THE SOUTHERN </p><p>SUBURBS REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME, ELYSSAR.  A HIZBALLAH </p><p>AND BIRRI MAN WILL TAKE THE TWO SEATS, AND FADLALLAH </p><p>AND SHAMS AD-DIN EACH WILL WITHDRAW HIS CANDIDATE. </p><p>THIS DECISION -- STILL TO BE RATIFIED BY THE CABINET </p><p>ON JULY 13 -- COMPLETES THE YEARS-LONG TRANSFORMATION </p><p>OF HIZBALLAH\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HARIRI\'S SWEEPING </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN THE SUBURBS FROM OPEN HOSTILITY </p><p>TO ACCOMMODATION.  WHILE THE NATURE OF THIS ODD AND </p><p>LIMITED ALLIANCE OF HARIRI AND HIZBALLAH WILL TAKE </p><p>TIME TO CLARIFY, HIZBALLAH\'S DECISION TO JOIN THE </p><p>BOARD SUGGESTS A REALIZATION THAT IN FUTURE IT CAN </p><p>WORK WITH, NOT AGAINST THE STATE TO RETAIN ITS GAINS </p><p>IN THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PM RAFIQ HARIRI, PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER NABIH </p><p>BERRI, AND SHI\'A SPIRITUAL LEADER MUHAMMAD MAHDI </p><p>SHAMS AD-DIN GATHERED LATE JULY 11.  THEY TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS THAT THE TALKS CENTERED ON THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>SOUTH.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO MUHAMMAD SAMMAK, A KEY </p><p>AIDE TO HARIRI AND CONFIDANT OF SHAMS AD-DIN, THE </p><p>REAL TOPIC WAS A DISPUTE OVER ELYSSAR, THE </p><p>CORPORATION BEING FORMED TO DEVELOP PARTS OF THE </p><p>SOUTHERN SUBURBS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE DISPUTE INVOLVED THE NOMINATION OF FOUR </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR TWO RESERVED SHI\'A SEATS ON THE BOARD </p><p>OF DIRECTORS.  BERRI, SHAMS AD-DIN, HIZBALLAH </p><p>SPIRITUAL GUIDE MUHAMMAD HUSAYN FADLALLAH, AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH EACH PROPOSED A NAME.  AFTER LENGTHY </p><p>GRIDLOCK, FADLALLAH AND HIZBALLAH AGREED THIS WEEK TO </p><p>PROPOSE A SINGLE CANDIDATE (THAT THEY TOOK SO LONG TO </p><p>AGREE REFLECTS THE DIVISION BETWEEN FADLALLAH AND THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY).  ON THE LLTH, SHAMS AD-DIN </p><p>AGREED TO WITHDRAW HIS PREFERRED CANDIDATE IN FAVOR </p><p>OF BERRI\'S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THERE WAS LITTLE APPARENT CONTROVERSY OVER THE </p><p>OTHER SEATS, WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR TWO SUNNIS, ONE </p><p>MARONITE, AND ONE GREEK CATHOLIC.  THE CABINET IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO APPROVE THE RESULTS OF HARIRI\'S BACK-ROOM </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON JULY 13. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS REFLECT A MARKED </p><p>TRANSFORMATION IN THE ATTITUDES OF HARIRI AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH TO EACH OTHER, AND IN HIZBALLAH\'S VIEW OF </p><p>THE FUTURE.  WHEN IN THE WINTER OF 1992 HARIRI FIRST </p><p>UNVEILED THE ELYSSAR CONCEPT -- MODELED ON THE </p><p>EQUALLY CONTROVERSIAL SOLIDERE COMPANY SET UP TO </p><p>REDEVELOP DOWNTOWN BEIRUT -- HIZBALLAH RAISED </p><p>STRIDENT OBJECTIONS IN THE STREETS, MOSQUES, AND </p><p>PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE PARTY WHIPPED UP A FRENZY BY REMINDING ITS </p><p>AUDIENCE OF AMIN GEMAYEL\'S ATTEMPTS IN THE 80\'S TO </p><p>BULLDOZE THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS AND DISPLACE ITS </p><p>CITIZENRY UNDER THE GUISE OF REDEVELOPMENT. </p><p>HIZBALLAH PREYED ON THIS POPULAR FEAR AMONG THE SHI\'A </p><p>IN AN OBVIOUS PLOY TO KEEP THE STATE OUT OF THE </p><p>SUBURBS, SO HIZBALLAH COULD REMAIN THE SOLE PROVIDER </p><p>OF SERVICE AND SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  HARIRI, FOR HIS PART, WAS JUST AS DETERMINED TO </p><p>CHALLENGE HIZBALLAH THROUGH HIS MASSIVE REAL ESTATE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES, WHICH INTEND TO HARNESS PRIVATE </p><p>CAPITAL TO THE DAUNTING TASK OF REBUILDING GREATER </p><p>BEIRUT.  PARALYSIS RESULTED FROM THIS STANDOFF. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN THE SUMMER OF 1995, HOWEVER, CHANGED </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES BORE FRUIT.  IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>HIZBALLAH, HARIRI AGREED THAT THE THOUSANDS OF </p><p>SQUATTERS NOW SETTLED IN THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ZONE -- HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS, FOR THE MOST PART -- </p><p>WOULD BE PERMITTED TO STAY PUT, AND THAT ELYSSAR </p><p>WOULD REPLACE THEIR RAMSHACKLE HOUSING WITH NEW </p><p>APARTMENTS IN KEEPING WITH THE RESORT-TOWN LOOK </p><p>ENVISIONED BY ALYSSAR FOR THE ZONE.  THIS REMOVED THE </p><p>PARTY\'S RALLYING CRY AGAINST THE SCHEME. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WIDER POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, HOWEVER, PROBABLY </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR THE PARTY\'S WILLINGNESS TO JOIN TOGETHER </p><p>WITH HARIRI IN DEVELOPING ONE OF ITS STRONGHOLDS. </p><p>THE DECISION IS IN KEEPING WITH A PRAGMATIC CURRENT </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY WHICH WANTS TO READY HIZBALLAH FOR </p><p>THE TRANSFORMATION FROM A MILITIA WHICH CHALLENGES </p><p>THE STATE TO A SERVICE-ORIENTED PARTY WITH A PLACE </p><p>INSIDE LEGITIMATE POLITICS.  IN SIGNING UP WITH </p><p>ELYSSAR, HIZBALLAH MAY ALSO HAVE RECOGNIZED THE VALUE </p><p>OF ASSOCIATION WITH THE NEXT LARGE SOURCE OF </p><p>INVESTMENT IN THE SUBURBS, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE </p><p>IRANIAN CASH FLOW WHICH SUPPORTS HIZBALLAH\'S SERVICE </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE SUBURBS MAY SOON DIMINISH.  HARIRI </p><p>GAINS THE SUPPORT OF THE MOST VOCAL ELEMENT IN THE </p><p>SUBURBS, AND THUS PEACE FOR HIS LUCRATIVE PLAN. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>11.  THIS MUTUAL COZYING UP BY HARIRI AND HIZBALLAH </p><p>COMES CHIEFLY AT THE EXPENSE OF SHI\'A SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADER SHAMS AD-DIN.  WHILE SHAMS AD-DIN -- THE </p><p>SUCCESSOR OF IMAM MUSA SADR AS HEAD OF THE HIGHER </p><p>ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL (HISC) -- WOULD BE THE STATE\'S </p><p>NATURAL ALLY IN SHI\'A AFFAIRS, HIS SIMULTANEOUS FEUDS </p><p>WITH BERRI AND HIZBALLAH PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE. </p><p>HE ALSO LACKS HIZBALLAH\'S MUSCLE IN THE SUBURBS, SO </p><p>DOES NOT NEED TO BE ACCOMMODATED.  IN THE LONG RUN, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE SIDELINING OF SHAMS AD-DIN CAN ONLY </p><p>ENCOURAGE A FURTHER RADICALIZATION OF SHI\'A POLITICS, </p><p>DOMINATED BY THE MILITIA-TYPE NETWORKS OF BERRI AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH. </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
