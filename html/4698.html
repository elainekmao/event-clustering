<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  NOVEMBER 25 "FRIENDS GROUP" MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2831 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 3033 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter hosted the third meeting </p><p>of Chiefs of Mission of Germany, France, Canada, and the </p><p>U.K. Deputy High Commissioner on November 25 to discuss </p><p>upcoming Nigerian elections.  The November 25 meeting </p><p>concentrated on the need for uniform standards by which to </p><p>judge Nigeria\'s 2003 elections, local elections monitors, </p><p>international observers, and the need for a political party </p><p>Code of Conduct.  The group agreed to a list of actions to </p><p>be taken by mid-December in order to move the electoral </p><p>process forward.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter invited the Chiefs of Mission of </p><p>Germany, France, Canada and the U.K. to continue </p><p>discussions (reftels) November 25.  The group identified </p><p>four important issues to address: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  international observers; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  support for local NGOs\' observation efforts; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  a political "Code of Conduct;" and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  INEC\'s continued logistical shortcomings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The group began by discussing acceptable </p><p>parameters for Nigeria\'s 2003 election.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>commented that the most important issue was acceptance by </p><p>the Nigerian electorate, although the international </p><p>community should continue to push for an improvement on the </p><p>1999 elections performance.  German Ambassador Dietmar </p><p>Kreusel said that the European Union (EU) Heads of Mission </p><p>in Abuja are preparing a report on the status of elections </p><p>preparation and prospects for a successful exercise, which </p><p>he promised to share with the "Friends Group" when </p><p>completed.  He then noted that the EU saw little prospect </p><p>for free and fair elections, so finding acceptable </p><p>alternative criteria would be important.  (COMMENT:  There </p><p>was general agreement that a strict "free and fair" test </p><p>would doom Nigeria to failure.  An agreed defensible </p><p>alternative test that Nigeria might reasonably be expected </p><p>to pass could not be formulated during the meeting.  The </p><p>U.K. held out for 1999 or better, a criterion most others </p><p>questioned Nigeria\'s likelihood of satisfying.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Turning to the issue of elections monitors, the </p><p>group reported some confusion on the Nigerian side about </p><p>the process by which the international community would be </p><p>allowed to monitor elections.  While officials in the </p><p>Presidency and INEC indicated support for the idea, no </p><p>entity clearly had the lead.  Ambassador Jeter reported </p><p>that MFA was acutely reticent to step in before holding </p><p>discussions with INEC and knowing such fundamentals as </p><p>timing, elections sequencing, etc.  The MFA has noted the </p><p>"sensitivity" of the 2003 elections, and the need for </p><p>Nigerians to work out the modalities for the way forward. </p><p>Kreusel said that an EU team had been told the GON "would </p><p>categorically not" issue invitations, but will entertain </p><p>"requests for permission" to observe.  He warned that it </p><p>would be logistically impossible to mobilize the </p><p>approximately 100 EU observers on short notice.  British </p><p>Deputy High Commissioner Charles Bird said he had been told </p><p>that the "State Security Service needs to approve all </p><p>observers" so a list of candidates should be submitted in </p><p>time for the appropriate security checks.  The group </p><p>discussed the merits of accrediting local diplomats as </p><p>official observers, and tentatively agreed that arguments </p><p>for and against this practice suggested a combined </p><p>approach.  They suggested that some diplomats might be </p><p>accredited, while others should observe elections merely as </p><p>diplomats accredited to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter recommended coordinating </p><p>international support to domestic monitoring groups, </p><p>pointing to USAID support for the TMG in the 1999 elections </p><p>as a model.  Bird said that, from the British perspective, </p><p>TMG lacked the capabilities it had in 1999.  All agreed on </p><p>the need to support local monitors and on the importance of </p><p>identifying credible groups.  They also agreed that most of </p><p>the current groups involved in the monitoring process were </p><p>dominated by southerners and highlighted the importance of </p><p>recruiting northern NGOs to participate in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter stressed the importance of </p><p>convincing INEC and the political parties to adopt a "Code </p><p>of Conduct" for elections activities.  The other members of </p><p>the group asked for copies of the INEC-produced draft from </p><p>earlier in 2002.  This issue will be taken up at the next </p><p>meeting of the Friends Group, with discussion of how a </p><p>credible and workable Code can be achieved. </p><p>7.  (C)  Canadian High Commissioner Howard Strauss said </p><p>that the flawed registration process appeared no closer to </p><p>resolution.  Bird maintained that INEC Chairman Dr. Abel </p><p>Guobadia was put in place "to deliver Obasanjo;" thus, INEC </p><p>instinctively opposed observers or any type of electoral </p><p>support that would interfere with ensuring Obasanjo\'s </p><p>reelection.  He warned that by investing in INEC, the </p><p>international community could be put in the position of </p><p>validating a flawed process.  The group agreed that INEC </p><p>had yet to provide enough information to evaluate its </p><p>chances of (or interest in) success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The group reached consensus on four specific </p><p>actions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  send diplomatic notes individually to MFA and the </p><p>Presidency requesting information about the guidelines for </p><p>observer accreditation; </p><p>--  identify potential northern groups to serve as </p><p>elections monitors; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  push INEC and the parties to adopt a "Code of Conduct;" </p><p>and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  maintain pressure on INEC, individually and </p><p>collectively, to respond to concerns arising from the </p><p>flawed registration process and INEC\'s lack of progress in </p><p>preparing for credible elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The "Friends Group" will meet again following the </p><p>upcoming holidays. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
