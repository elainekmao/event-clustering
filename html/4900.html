Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Turkey has issued new quarantine </p><p>regulations governing imports of all plants and plant </p><p>products that is scheduled to go into effect on January 3, </p><p>2003. Turkey did not notify the WTO of the new regulations </p><p>nor did Turkish officials notify Embassies of these changes. </p><p>Despite requests for flexibility on implementation, Turkish </p><p>officials will not postpone implementation.  It is too soon </p><p>to determine the regulation\'s effect on trade.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>New Regulations Announced </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In July 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural </p><p>Affairs (MARA) published new regulations concerning </p><p>quarantine of plants and commodities.  No notification was </p><p>sent to foreign embassies in Ankara regarding the </p><p>regulations that are to be implemented on January 3, 2003. </p><p>AgOffice became aware of the new regulations in October and </p><p>requested more information. MARA officials from Protection </p><p>and Control stated that the changes were minor.  In </p><p>addition, MARA officials promised to provide an English </p><p>version of the 100-page document. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture No Help </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) After repeated delays and promises, MARA provided </p><p>an English copy of the regulations at the beginning of </p><p>December.  A copy was sent to the regional APHIS official in </p><p>Vienna who in turn sent it to Washington for review.  After </p><p>consulting with APHIS/Vienna, AgCounselor met with the </p><p>Turkish General Directorate of Protection and Control, Dr. </p><p>Huseyin Sungur, on December 19 to discuss the new </p><p>regulations and request some flexibility in implementation. </p><p>Dr. Sungur repeatedly stated that he had no authority to </p><p>postpone implementation and insisted that he foresaw no </p><p>major problems with the new regulations. Sungur also noted </p><p>that his country had notified the World Trade Organization </p><p>of the new regulations.  Note:  A Subsequent check with the </p><p>WTO turned out that there had been no formal notification. </p><p>End note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Following the Sungur meeting, AgCounselor met with </p><p>Sinan Varol, head of the Department for External Relations </p><p>at MARA.  In addition to several other issues, AgCounselor </p><p>informed Varol of the situation and the difficulties it </p><p>would cause both U.S. and Turkish businesses.  Varol stated </p><p>that this was the responsibility of Protection and Control </p><p>and that his office had no control or influence on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Little Help at Foreign Trade </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On December 19, AgCounselor and EconOff met with </p><p>Tuncer Kayalar, the Under Secretary for Foreign Trade. </p><p>U/S Kayalar was sympathetic to our request and asked some of </p><p>his staff to contact the Agriculture Ministry regarding our </p><p>request.  However it was clear, given the various comments, </p><p>that Foreign Trade had to follow MARA\'s lead on this issue. </p><p>Moreover, there was little that could be done to change the </p><p>law by January 3.  Kayalar\'s staff acknowledged that Turkey </p><p>had not submitted a notification on the new regulations to </p><p>the WTO but other than looking a little sheepish offered </p><p>little to rectify the situation.  In fact, the Ministry felt </p><p>that it was MARA\'s responsibility to inform all parties on </p><p>the any changes in regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Impact on Trade </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) It is difficult to fully assess the impact the new </p><p>regulations will have on trade.  AgAnkara has already </p><p>received calls from concerned importers.  The initial </p><p>assessment from APHIS/Washington is that there will be a lot </p><p>to review and that the changes are not as "minor" as the </p><p>Turks have stated.  On the other hand, the Turkish officials </p><p>stated that they are based on EU quarantine regulations so </p><p>that there should not be any major surprises.  In any case, </p><p>Post will monitor the situation after implementation and </p><p>report any disruption in trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Comment:  Keeping the Pressure On </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In recent years, we have consistently raised with </p><p>GOT our concerns about its failure to notify the WTO </p><p>systematically of rule changes.   We will continue to make </p><p>this point to the new government, and will emphasize the </p><p>link between implementing international rules and attracting </p><p>foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
