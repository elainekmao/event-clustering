<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/19/12 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KPAO, VM, UNHRC-1, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION PROFILES-VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  STATE 252917     B.  HANOI 2612 </p><p> </p><p>-     C.  HANOI 2621       D.  HANOI 2823 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02956  01 OF 02  120931Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  AS FAR AS EMBASSY CAN ASCERTAIN FROM THIS </p><p>DISTANCE, VIETNAM IS AT BEST A MARGINAL PLAYER ON THE </p><p>UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND AT TIMES IS ACTIVELY </p><p>OPPOSED TO US VALUES AND VIEWS.  VIETNAM LIKELY SOUGHT </p><p>A SEAT ON THE COMMISSION PRIMARILY AS A MEANS OF </p><p>ENHANCING ITS INTERNATIONAL STATURE, A PROCESS TOWARD </p><p>WHICH IT HAS WORKED ASSIDUOUSLY AND SUCCESSFULLY OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE.  THE OTHER PART OF THE GVN\'S CALCULUS </p><p>WAS PROBABLY TO BE WELL-PLACED TO PROTECT ITS OWN </p><p>INTERESTS -- AND THOSE OF "TRADITIONAL FRIENDS" LIKE </p><p>LIBYA, IRAN, AND IRAQ -- AGAINST WHAT IT CLAIMS IS THE </p><p>EROSION OF INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES RESPECTING NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>EMBASSY IS NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT THE USG CAN CHANGE </p><p>VIETNAM\'S VIEWS OR PARTICIPATION IN ANY MEANINGFUL </p><p>MANNER.  (SEE REF B FOR A DISCUSSION ON VIETNAM\'S TAKE </p><p>ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AND REF C FOR ITS OVERALL WORLDVIEW.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COUNTRY PROFILE: </p><p>A.  THE MFA DETERMINES VIETNAM\'S VOTES IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORA, FOLLOWING OVERALL POLICY GUIDELINES SET DOWN BY </p><p>THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV).  A CPV "CELL" </p><p>OVERSEEING BOTH THE MFA AND THE CPV\'S COMMISSION ON </p><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS PROBABLY MAKES KEY DECISIONS, APART </p><p>FROM EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ONES THAT NEED TO BE PRESENTED </p><p>TO THE CPV POLITBURO.  FEW, IF ANY, DECISIONS REGARDING </p><p>THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ARE LIKELY VETTED AT THE </p><p>POLITBURO LEVEL.  THE GVN REPRESENTATIVE IN GENEVA IS </p><p>PROBABLY ON A FAIRLY SHORT LEASE, WHILE THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>IN WASHINGTON ALMOST CERTAINLY PLAYS NO ROLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02956  01 OF 02  120931Z </p><p>WHATSOEVER.  VIETNAM WILL NONETHELESS LISTEN </p><p>ATTENTIVELY TO THE VIEWS OF THE G-77 AND ASEAN ON MAJOR </p><p>ISSUES, AND LIKES WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO VOTE WITH THE </p><p>MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p>B.  THE TOP MFA CONTACT IS FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY </p><p>NIEN, WHO SPEAKS GOOD ENGLISH (ALTHOUGH HE OFTEN </p><p>PREFERS TO USE AN INTERPRETER).  HIS OFFICE TELEPHONE </p><p>IS 84-4-199-2218 OR 84-9-13238218 DURING WORKING HOURS </p><p>(12 HOURS DIFFERENCE FROM WASHINGTON), OR 84-4-845-2980 </p><p>(NON-WORKING HOURS).  THERE IS NO POINT IN TRYING TO </p><p>CONTACT CPV OFFICIALS DIRECTLY; THEY CLAIM THEIR ROLE </p><p>IS PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>C.  THE GVN IN GENERAL DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD INVOKE SANCTIONS OR </p><p>SINGLE OUT PARTICULAR COUNTRIES (APART FROM THE U.S. OR </p><p>ISRAEL) FOR CRITICISM.  SENSITIVE TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRITICISM ON ITS OWN HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, VIETNAM WILL </p><p>SEEK TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION SPENDS AS LITTLE </p><p>TIME AS POSSIBLE EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.  ITS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN GENEVA WILL GENERALLY DISCOURAGE </p><p>FORMAL CONDEMNATIONS OF SPECIFIC COUNTRIES -- UNLESS </p><p>THERE IS A CLEAR CONSENSUS AMONG THE G-77 OR OTHER </p><p>MAJOR GROUPING OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  EMBASSY DOES </p><p>NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GVN HAS A SPECIFIC AGENDA OF ITS </p><p>OWN TO ADVANCE WITHIN THE COMMISSION, AND EXPECTS IT </p><p>WILL BE A FOLLOWER, NOT A LEADER, IN ITS DELIBERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  A TOP GVN PRIORITY OVER THE COMING DECADE IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA IS TO WIN A UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02956  01 OF 02  120931Z </p><p>SEAT FOR 2008.  IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN ITS CAMPAIGN, </p><p>QUIETLY LOBBYING A VARIETY OF NATIONS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>U.S. (REF D).  ASEAN ENDORSED THIS CANDIDACY IN ITS </p><p>ANNUAL MEETING IN 2002.  THE USG CAN PLAY THIS CARD, </p><p>CITING RESPONSIBLE AND PRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE </p><p>COMMISSION AS ONE CRITERION THE USG WILL CONSIDER WHEN </p><p>MAKING ITS DECISION ON A UNSC SEAT.  THE USG AID </p><p>PROGRAM FOR VIETNAM IS EXCLUSIVELY HUMANITARIAN AND </p><p>TRADE-RELATED, AND SO DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO LEVERAGE </p><p>RELATED TO COMMISSION ACTIVITIES OR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>E.  THE MFA HAS ALREADY INDICATED THAT IT WISHES TO </p><p>PICK UP THE PACE OF BILATERAL DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES OVER </p><p>THE NEXT YEAR, INCLUDING POSSIBLE VISITS TO THE US BY: </p><p>MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE TRA (FEBRUARY/MARCH); </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KHOAN (MARCH/APRIL); FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER NIEN (JUNE); AND PRIME MINISTER KHAI </p><p>(NOVEMBER/DECEMBER).  THEY WOULD WELCOME VISITS TO </p><p>VIETNAM IN 2003 OF USTR ZOELLICK (MARCH); DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY ARMITAGE (JUNE); AND SECRETARY POWELL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(JUNE/JULY).  IN ADDITION, THE SECRETARY WILL MEET WITH </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER AT THE ASEAN POST-MINISTERIAL </p><p>CONFERENCE AND ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM IN PHNOM PENH IN </p><p>MID-JUNE, WHILE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD AGAIN BE SEATED </p><p>NEXT TO PRIME MINISTER KHAI AT THE APEC SUMMIT NEXT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9040 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02956  02 OF 02  120931Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     ECA-00   IIP-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------168896  120932Z /38 </p><p>O 120854Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8329 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YEAR.  ALL OF THESE VISITS WOULD GIVE US A GOOD FACE- </p><p>TO-FACE OPPORTUNITY TO LOBBY OUR OWN CANDIDACY FOR THE </p><p>COMMISSION AS WELL AS FOR OUR AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>F.

VISITS TO </p><p>VIETNAM BY US EXPERTS (BOTH ACADEMICS AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS) ON THE UN SYSTEM AND ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OFFER THE BEST LONG-TERM HOPE FOR INFLUENCING </p><p>OPINIONS AT LEAST OF ELITE GROUPS, BUT PROVIDE LIMITED </p><p>VALUE IN ACHIEVING USG GOALS FOR THE CHR-59. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
