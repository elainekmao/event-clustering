<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: WILL BURMA\'S BANKS SURVIVE? SIGNS POINT TO NO </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 365 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Another payday passed without incident on </p><p>March 31, but that does not mean that all is well in Burma. </p><p>The banking crisis continues grimly on, with increasing </p><p>negative spillover into the general economy.  Though bankers, </p><p>borrowers, and businesses are begging for mercy, government </p><p>policies have thus far only exacerbated the pain.  The GOB\'s </p><p>objective is uncertain; it may simply want to clear out some </p><p>bad banking operations.  Alternatively, it may be aiming for </p><p>some more general government takeover of the private banking </p><p>sector.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>All Quiet on the Industrial Front </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Another payday came and went on March 31 without </p><p>disturbance.  Industrialists and bankers with whom we spoke </p><p>said that for the most part workers were paid at least part </p><p>of their salary through a patchwork of short term measures. </p><p>Those with a steady income (such as garment exporters) had no </p><p>problem, others continued selling off dollars or other assets </p><p>(at depressed prices) and/or borrowing privately from </p><p>cash-rich firms to make ends meet.  In other cases factory </p><p>owners had to beg forbearance from workers, extending only </p><p>25-50 percent of employee salaries.  Some bankers reportedly </p><p>tried to open their coffers to large private corporate </p><p>customers to help them meet their responsibilities, but were </p><p>rejected by the GOB\'s banking "oversight" committee, the </p><p>Private Bank Management Committee. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) All were adamant, though, that another peaceful payday </p><p>is no indication that the banking crisis is resolved or that </p><p>the economy is back on track.  Private banks are still </p><p>restricted by fiat from offering more than 100,000 kyat </p><p>(about $110 at current rates) per week to each depositor.  As </p><p>a result, kyats remain in short supply as businesses and </p><p>others hoard whatever kyat they have pending a return of </p><p>economic confidence and liquidity to the market.  Reflecting </p><p>this, the kyat/dollar rate has settled at about 900, despite </p><p>a brief uptick in dollar value in the week ending March 21st </p><p>due to the government\'s biannual international gem auction. </p><p> </p><p>Bankers or Victims? </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The regime\'s major policy thrust continues to be </p><p>forcing borrowers to repay 40 percent of their outstanding </p><p>loans by April 30.  In only the second GOB statement on the </p><p>banking situation since it began, Secretary One, General Khin </p><p>Nyunt, told the Union of Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and </p><p>Industry on March 29, "in consideration of those who had </p><p>deposited money in the banks, in the long-term interests of </p><p>the banks, and to strengthen the national economy, those who </p><p>have taken loans from the banks should try to repay the debts </p><p>speedily."  Bankers report that they, with assistance from </p><p>Military Intelligence, have been somewhat successful in </p><p>getting borrowers to return money, but that not all companies </p><p>are able to meet the requirement.  However, bankers assert, </p><p>this approach is killing their customers.  It may help settle </p><p>their obligations to depositors, but in the end, banks, </p><p>businesses and individuals will all go under collectively. </p><p>Corporate borrowers complain that the demand for loan </p><p>repayment, the lack of new credit, and the general economic </p><p>doldrums, have frozen their production and eroded profits. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On top of this, according to several bankers, some of </p><p>the private banks are no longer accepting new deposits.  It </p><p>is unclear whether this is due to a new directive from the </p><p>Committee, or whether private banks are interpreting broadly </p><p>a previous order to cease offering so-called "special </p><p>deposits" (deposits whose total value the banks would </p><p>guarantee).  Whatever the case, while loan repayments will </p><p>keep up with demand for withdrawals for now, a cut-off of new </p><p>deposits, combined with existing prohibitions on extending </p><p>new credit, will slowly starve the banks to death. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Though the origin of this new policy is debatable, </p><p>bankers and economists are predictably blaming the </p><p>government.  They argue that the SPDC is intentionally </p><p>softening up the largest private banks for future liquidation </p><p>or merger with either a government bank (namely Myanmar </p><p>Economic Bank) or one of the two military-run banks (Innwa </p><p>Bank and Myawaddy Bank).  The rumor mill\'s money is on the </p><p>relatively young and agile Innwa Bank (run by the Myanmar </p><p>Economic Corporation (MEC)) as MEC\'s Chairman, Quartermaster </p><p>General Lieutenant General Tin Aung Myint Oo, is now in </p><p>charge of the Private Bank Management Committee.  Experts </p><p>estimate that at current rates of repayment and withdrawals, </p><p>private banks can last another one to six months before they </p><p>go under. </p><p> </p><p>GOB\'s Rose-Tinted Glasses </p><p>7. (C) Though the current economic problems are clear to </p><p>economists, bankers, and businesspeople, the GOB sees it </p><p>differently.  The new Minister of Finance (a general whose </p><p>previous area of concern was ordnance production) recently </p><p>told one highly placed source that the strengthening kyat, </p><p>deflation of the asset bubbles, and the stabilization or </p><p>decline of prices of many consumer goods prove that the GOB\'s </p><p>response to the banking situation has been just what the </p><p>doctor ordered.  Bankers tell us that this same "tough love" </p><p>sentiment pervades nightly Private Bank Management Committee </p><p>sessions. </p><p> </p><p>The Blame Game Continues </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The government\'s position has always been that private </p><p>bankers got themselves into this mess and can damn well get </p><p>themselves back out by calling in the speculative investments </p><p>and insider loans that seem to have characterized private </p><p>banking in Burma.  In econspeak, one might say that the </p><p>government is sensitive to the moral hazard that would emerge </p><p>from too precipitous a bailout of some of the larger private </p><p>banks.  Bankers themselves, of course, see things </p><p>differently.  They point to the antecedent conditions under </p><p>which they were obliged to operate, while implicitly asking </p><p>whether there was any other way to make money in banking when </p><p>deposit and lending rates were capped at levels 5000 basis </p><p>points below inflation.  Both sides are of course right, just </p><p>as both sides were originally wrong in their behavior.  Right </p><p>now, however, sorting out who was right and who was wrong is </p><p>not nearly as important as containing the crisis\' infection </p><p>of the rest of the economy. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The fact is, however, that the government\'s approach </p><p>has thus far only worsened the liquidity crunch.  While the </p><p>regime\'s actions have produced some unintended benefits in </p><p>reducing general inflation and popping the asset price </p><p>bubbles that had grown up in recent years, it has also placed </p><p>most businesses under extraordinary pressures.  So far, the </p><p>government seems to believe that only a few of the largest </p><p>private banks will go down, when all is said and done, and </p><p>that state and military-owned banks will be able to pick up </p><p>the slack.  However, there are no firewalls between the </p><p>private banks and the government-run institutions.  Moreover, </p><p>government-owned banks will almost certainly be far less </p><p>inclined than their private sector competitors to seek out </p><p>non-government borrowers, depositors, and business </p><p>opportunities.  While the economy could undoubtedly do with a </p><p>more restrained credit-generation machine, an expansion of </p><p>the government banking sector will most certainly chill the </p><p>overall economic environment, push more of the economy </p><p>underground, and set back Burma\'s meager economic development. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In short, the government here is playing a high-risk </p><p>game.  It may be right.  We haven\'t seen the loan books of </p><p>any of these banks, and can\'t really say if the GOB is </p><p>justified in coming down on them so hard.  However, we can be </p><p>certain that if the regime is wrong, the entire Burmese </p><p>economy will pay a heavy price for the SPDC\'s mistakes. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
