<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0093 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 2, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 2, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal/Milliyet: The U.S.Department of </p><p>State\'s Human Rights Report for 2002 has been </p><p>published. The section covering Turkey emphasized </p><p>that the government, in general, was respectful </p><p>toward human rights and had realized some </p><p>fundamental reforms. However, torture, use of </p><p>excessive force and paucity in accountability for </p><p>crimes committed by security forces still </p><p>remained as serious problems. It is reported that </p><p>State Department\'s annual Human Rights Report </p><p>used to have a serious effect in the world, but </p><p>because the US also has been violating human </p><p>rights in the operations it has undertaken in </p><p>various countries questions have been raised </p><p>about the credibility of the report. The State </p><p>Department draws heavily in its report on </p><p>information gathered in Turkey by the Human </p><p>Rights Foundation, Human Rights Association, and </p><p>Amnesty International.  Newspapers go into </p><p>considerable detail about the kudos and </p><p>criticisms directed at Turkey in the report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Radikal: 48 planes and 1,400 soldiers </p><p>deployed at Incirlik AB for Operation Northern </p><p>Watch are ready to leave the base within the week </p><p>depending on the consequence of developments with </p><p>Colin Powel\'s visit to Turkey. The US had built </p><p>up an immense amount of military equipment prior </p><p>the war at the base, which has not been allowed </p><p>by the Turkish government to be used in air </p><p>strikes against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Milli Gazete: A US Prowler plane made an </p><p>emergency landing at Incirlik AB last night. </p><p>Tight security measures were taken around the </p><p>runway and, after landing, fire brigades </p><p>surrounded the plane, at the rear of which flames </p><p>could be seen. The plane taxied to the hangar </p><p>half an hour later, and it took off from the base </p><p>around midnight. Two C-130 cargo planes took off </p><p>from the base early morning as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milli Gazete: Siirt Governorate has been </p><p>giving classes in 59 subjects at its Public </p><p>Training Center for free. Regarding the issue, </p><p>Siirt Governor Nuri Okutan said the percentage of </p><p>children enrolled in preschool education </p><p>increased, as did the percentage of girls </p><p>enrolled in schools.  In addition, the </p><p>Governorate has tried to reach out to around </p><p>6,000 women and young girls without education by </p><p>involving them in weaving cooperatives and </p><p>multipurpose social centers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Evrensel/Cumhuriyet/Turkiye: Dagyani </p><p>villagers of Sanliurfa who threw stones and eggs </p><p>at US experts coming from Incirlik AB to remove </p><p>fragments of a missile that erroneously fell </p><p>nearby the village were detained by jandarma and </p><p>released by the court after a hearing. Sanliurfa </p><p>human rights activists reacted angrily to the </p><p>interrogations of the villagers and demanded a </p><p>similar response be shown to the US military, </p><p>which is threatening the physical security of the </p><p>people with missiles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Evrensel: Van\'s former administrator of </p><p>HADEP, Bazi Aslan, and a City Councilmember, </p><p>Cihat Kara, were each sentenced to 10 months of </p><p>imprisonment on the charges of "resisting the </p><p>police" during a press conference on the occasion </p><p>of World\'s Women\'s Day on March 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Milliyet: During a fashion show at the </p><p>opening of a sportswear shop in Adana, models </p><p>from Istanbul and Izmir protested the war in </p><p>Iraq. The models opened a banner reading "Let </p><p>there be no wars. Do not let children die." at </p><p>the fashion show, which was attended by prominent </p><p>people from Adana. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye/Bolge: Mersin Municipality is </p><p>planning to open a tender for the town\'s </p><p>Wastewater Treatment Plant on April 4.  Mersin </p><p>Mayor Macit Ozcan said they would realize the </p><p>project with a Euro 60 million loan. Mayor Ozcan </p><p>said six qualifying companies would compete for </p><p>the project, which will serve a municipal </p><p>population of 750,000 people. Meanwhile, Mersin </p><p>Municipality signed an MOU with a Canadian </p><p>company for constructing a garbage-processing </p><p>plant. The plant will produce heat and energy to </p><p>be used in Mersin. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
