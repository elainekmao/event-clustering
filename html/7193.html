<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001293 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, KPAL, US, IS, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI CONCERNS ON MEETING ITS AID PLEDGE TO PA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 85451 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 1283 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador discussed the issue of Kuwaiti support </p><p>for the Palestinian Authority (ref A) with Shaykh Dr. Ahmed </p><p>Nasser al-Sabah, the Head of Office for Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah, the morning of </p><p>April 6.  (Dr. Mohammed was unavailable due to a last-minute </p><p>Council of Ministers meeting prior to his departure for his </p><p>tour of P-5 capitals, ref B.)  Drawing on ref A talking </p><p>points, the Ambassador explained the situation to Shaykh </p><p>Ahmed in detail and pointed out that Dr. Mohammed should be </p><p>prepared to respond on this issue in his meetings in </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Dr. Ahmed thanked the Ambassador for reviewing the </p><p>issue with him.  He confided that the "real" reason that the </p><p>GOK was hesitating to transfer money to the Palestinian </p><p>Authority recently had nothing to do with Arafat or any other </p><p>"personal" issues.  The GOK understood the need to support </p><p>the PA and reform efforts at this critical time regardless of </p><p>such animosities.  He argued that in fact, the GOK had </p><p>transferred money to the Palestinians plenty of times in the </p><p>past when their relations with Arafat were worse than they </p><p>are now.  No, according to Dr. Ahmed, the actual reason for </p><p>their reluctance was a fear that the Israelis would find a </p><p>way to seize or at least freeze any funds they provided for </p><p>the PA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador said that he understood the history </p><p>that might lead to such fears but reiterated that the US had </p><p>made good progress in this area recently.  The Israelis were </p><p>now releasing tax revenues to the PA on schedule.  Dr. Ahmed </p><p>said that if this was the case, and the US could guarantee </p><p>that the Israelis would not seize/freeze the funds, Kuwait </p><p>would seriously consider making good on its AL pledge.  This </p><p>is the answer Dr. Mohammed would give if/when the issue was </p><p>raised with him in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: While somewhat encouraging, Dr. Ahmed\'s </p><p>response falls well short of a commitment.  Indeed, the </p><p>Kuwaiti position may be intended to put the ball back into </p><p>our court indefinitely, figuring that it will be impossible </p><p>for us to provide the requested guarantee.  Our skepticism </p><p>arises from past discussions with Dr. Mohammed on this topic. </p><p> Once before when urged that the GOK meet its Arab League </p><p>pledges to the Palestinians, he responded wryly that he found </p><p>it interesting that the US was trying to enforce AL </p><p>resolutions. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
