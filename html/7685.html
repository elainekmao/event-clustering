<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000588 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: POWER AT ANY PRICE? CEM UZAN\'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2516 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Initial contacts with Youth Party (GP) </p><p>officials in Istanbul confirm our belief that the party is </p><p>essentially a vehicle of convenience for media tycoon Cem </p><p>Uzan\'s considerable political ambitions.  At the same time, </p><p>GP is not resting on its laurels, but instead is moving </p><p>quickly to build up a grass-roots presence throughout </p><p>Istanbul, while Cem Uzan himself is reaching out to </p><p>mainstream Turkish politicians ) including independent </p><p>Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna.  Istanbul politicians </p><p>believe that GP\'s electoral performance in November was no </p><p>flash-in-the-pan, and that Uzan and his party are in politics </p><p>for the long haul.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Kid on the Block </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The November 2002 elections virtually wiped the </p><p>Istanbul political landscape clean, leaving just two parties </p><p>represented in parliament from Istanbul as elsewhere.  Even </p><p>the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP), which had long </p><p>relied on Istanbul as a solid voter base, could only manage </p><p>4.6 percent here.  The newly-formed Youth Party (GP), </p><p>however, despite a late slump in the polls, managed to </p><p>capture 8.3 percent of the Istanbul vote (improving on the </p><p>7.5 percent they received nationally).  As the heir-apparent </p><p>of one of Turkey\'s wealthiest, and most unscrupulous, </p><p>family-owned conglomerates, GP chairman and media tycoon Cem </p><p>Uzan was already well known before he entered politics. </p><p>Rumors suggest that the firm began as a small construction </p><p>outfit that ballooned in size as a result of illicit dealings </p><p>and money-laundering with the Qadaffi Libyan government. </p><p>Whether these rumors are true or false, almost all Istanbul </p><p>residents we have spoken to take the Uzans\' unscrupulous </p><p>reputation for granted.  While the USD 3 billion fraud case </p><p>leveled by Motorola and Nokia against the Uzan family further </p><p>enhanced their notoriety, most Istanbul Turks also remember </p><p>how Uzan-owned Star Television won, and then reneged on, the </p><p>contract to broadcast the premier Turkish soccer league </p><p>games, but not before selling thousands of decoder boxes and </p><p>non-refundable subscriptions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Local Billionaire Trying to Do Good? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>3. (C) Despite his family\'s unsavory reputation, Cem Uzan </p><p>appears to have made a successful transition to politics.  In </p><p>fact, some Istanbul contacts feel Uzan\'s personal wealth is a </p><p>political asset (i.e., "With more money than he knows what to </p><p>do with, (Uzan) is unlikely to fall prey to the corruption </p><p>that other politicians engage in").  Uzan also generously </p><p>funded his own political campaign.  A former top Star </p><p>executive told poloff that Uzan spent USD 40 million of his </p><p>personal fortune (Note: Others have put the figure as high as </p><p>USD 100 million.  End Note).  Whatever the total, Uzan made a </p><p>splash during the campaign by enlisting big-name music icons </p><p>to provide "free" concerts during his rallies and reportedly </p><p>offering free Telsim mobile phones to active supporters. </p><p>Uzan also hired well-known Istanbul advertising executive Ali </p><p>Taran not merely to produce GP\'s advertisements, but, </p><p>according to a former Taran associate, to craft his entire </p><p>public image to appeal to a wide, untapped voter base.  The </p><p>result was a finely-calibrated message combining populist </p><p>calls for lower taxes and higher spending with an </p><p>anti-Western, anti-IMF patriotic appeal to Turkish national </p><p>pride.  Since the elections, Uzan continued his spending </p><p>ways, blanketing Istanbul newspapers, television and radio </p><p>with another carefully-crafted nationalistic message firmly </p><p>opposing the U.S.-led war against Iraq, clearly another </p><p>populist effort to play to the vast majority who opposed the </p><p>war.  Nor did Uzan limit the campaign to his own media </p><p>channels.  GP Vice Chairman Tugba Kalafatoglu told poloff on </p><p>April 10 that they paid triple the going rate for advertising </p><p>space in rival Dogan group newspapers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Building From the Bottom Up and the Top Down </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) Istanbul Youth Party (GP) Chairman Hasan Bakkal </p><p>admitted to poloff on April 9 that GP had not been ready for </p><p>early elections and had barely enough time to establish a </p><p>token skeleton infrastructure in each of Istanbul\'s </p><p>districts.  GP had its first local party congress in February </p><p>(where Bakkal himself was elected the chairman of a 60-person </p><p>board) and has been working to develop a serious grassroots </p><p>infrastructure throughout the city.  Separately, City Council </p><p>Motherland Party (ANAP) Group President Recai Delibasioglu </p><p>told poloff that 12 of ANAP\'s Istanbul district chairmen had </p><p>defected to GP since the elections.  Bakkal\'s provincial </p><p>headquarters, for example, will move to new, larger office </p><p>space in the next few weeks to accommodate its growing staff. </p><p> Bakkal estimated (while freely admitting that he did not </p><p>have hard numbers) that GP has 150,000 registered volunteers </p><p>in Istanbul.  He told poloff that he hopes to have GP </p><p>volunteers personally visit between 65 and 70 percent of </p><p>Istanbul households by the end of the year.  On the critical </p><p>issue of finances, Bakkal claimed that GP is relying </p><p>exclusively on small donations from party members.  Bakkal </p><p>expressed skepticism regarding the possibility that GP will </p><p>receive government funds (Note: According to existing Turkish </p><p>laws, based on its recent electoral performance, GP should </p><p>now be entitled to annual disbursements of government funds. </p><p>End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While building from the bottom, GP is also looking to </p><p>recruit mainstream politicians at the top.  On April 9, </p><p>former State Minister and two-term True Path Party (DYP) </p><p>parliamentarian Ufuk Soylemez formally joined the Youth Party </p><p>(reftel).  Meanwhile, Bakkal confirmed to poloff that GP has </p><p>also invited independent Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna to </p><p>join the party.  Bakkal claimed that Gurtuna is close to GP, </p><p>but admitted that he has not yet made a decision.  (Note: We </p><p>had heard this from a number of other reliable sources as </p><p>well.  See septel for further details.  End Note).  Others </p><p>have told us that they too have been approached by GP, </p><p>including former Istanbul Mayor Bedrettin Dalan, former </p><p>Ambassador and Ozal Adviser Kaya Toperi, and ANAP City </p><p>Council Group President Recai Delibasioglu. Bakkal said that </p><p>GP has been flooded with applicants, but that they are </p><p>turning away all but the "best." Delibasioglu confirmed to </p><p>poloff that the lack of viable political alternatives has </p><p>given GP the luxury to be selective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Whither GP? </p><p>----------- </p><p>6. (C) GP is already looking forward to the upcoming April </p><p>2004 local elections, with a particular eye on the biggest </p><p>prize of all, Istanbul.  Our contacts here believe that GP\'s </p><p>electoral success was no mere flash-in-the-pan and that Cem </p><p>Uzan is here to stay.  Motivated more by personal ambition </p><p>than ideological convictions, many Istanbul politicians, like </p><p>some of their colleagues elsewhere, are already trying to </p><p>catch GP\'s rising star.  Our contacts predict that this trend </p><p>will accelerate if the AK government is unable to manage the </p><p>formidable political and economic challenges ahead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  What about Cem Uzan himself?  Former Star executive </p><p>and Uzan associate Aydin Ozdalga assured poloff that Cem Uzan </p><p>personally is unlikely to run for local office, even for the </p><p>influential position of Istanbul mayor.  His ambitions lie </p><p>much higher.  As for his ideological convictions, Ozdalga and </p><p>others believe that Uzan\'s anti-Western, populist rhetoric is </p><p>skin-deep; were he to come to power, he would in all </p><p>likelihood adopt more moderate policies.  GP Vice Chairman </p><p>Kalafatoglu made a similar argument, citing more modest, </p><p>nuanced rhetoric in recent GP advertising. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: GP has made significant inroads in Istanbul </p><p>with its nationalist bent and openly populist rhetoric, but </p><p>the party still has its work cut out for it.  For those </p><p>Istanbul politicians that place political ambition above </p><p>personal ideology, joining such a party would be acceptable </p><p>if such a move seemed politically fortuitous.  Consequently, </p><p>many are in a waiting mode to see how the AK government fares </p><p>in the coming months before deciding which way to jump. </p><p>Altough some believe that the GP rhetoric is based more on </p><p>political opportunism than any deep ideological conviction, </p><p>it remains to be seen whether Cem Uzan and GP will moderate </p><p>their tone in future elections or if they can eventually come </p><p>to power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Embassy Note: Cem Uzan and the GP appear to modify </p><p>their rhetoric according to regions.  As such, their approach </p><p>in Istanbul is likely to reflect a more urbane approach, at </p><p>least at the top.  Nationally, the party is uniformly more </p><p>extreme in its opportunism; our contacts to date give us no </p><p>reason to conclude that Uzan and GP will moderate their tone </p><p>or policies if they come to office. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
