SUMMARY:  DELIBERATIONS AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND RECENT </p><p>ESCALATIONS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES RECEIVED PROMINENT </p><p>COVERAGE IN LOCAL MEDIA.  NEWS REPORTING AND EDITORIALS WIDELY </p><p>ASSERT THAT THE U.S. IS DETERMINED TO ATTACK IRAQ REGARDLESS OF </p><p>THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTING AT THE UN.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE U.S. IS PLANNING TO DIVIDE IRAQ, AND OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES LATER, INTO ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN ENTITIES.  OTHER </p><p>EDITORIALS CRITICIZED THE MILD U.S. REACTION TOWARDS ISRAELI </p><p>KILLINGS OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA FEATURED </p><p>COVERAGE AND REACTION TO RECENT REMARKS ON IRAQ BY SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL AT THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AND </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH DURING THE MARCH 6 WHITE HOUSE PRESS CONFERENCE. </p><p>ABU DHABI TV, AL JAZEERA, THE MIDDLE EAST BROADCAST CENTER (MBC), </p><p>AND NEW ARABIC NEWS CHANNEL, AL ARABIYYA, CARRIED LIVE COVERAGE </p><p>OF THE MARCH 7TH UNSC DELIBERATIONS WITH COMMENTARY IN ADDITION </p><p>TO ANALYSIS OF SECRETARY POWELL\'S AND PRESIDENT BUSH\'S RECENT </p><p>REMARKS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON ALLEGED U.S. PLANS FOR IRAQ AFTER THE </p><p>ANTICIPATED ATTACKS, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/09: </p><p> </p><p>"... AMERICAN OFFICIALS REVEALED THAT IRAQ WILL BE DIVIDED INTO </p><p>THREE AREAS:  NORTHERN, MIDDLE, AND SOUTHERN.  THESE WILL BE </p><p>UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THREE AMERICANS:  THE PREVIOUS AMERICAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO YEMEN, BARBARA BODINE, AND TWO RETIRED U.S. </p><p>GENERALS.  THIS ... WILL ALSO DIVIDE IT INTO ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN </p><p>ENTITIES, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A CIVIL WAR THAT WILL DESTROY </p><p>WHATEVER IS LEFT OF IRAQ.  THIS IS A SAMPLE OF WHAT AWAITS OTHER </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES, AS IT IS A ZIONIST PLAN, DRAFTED FOR THE AMERICAN </p><p>STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 9/11, IN ORDER </p><p>TO RESHAPE THE REGION GEOGRAPHICALLY AND POLITICALLY IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMERICAN AND ISRAELI INTERESTS ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE MARCH 7TH UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING, "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA, GERMANY, AND ALL ARAB AND ISLAMIC </p><p>SUMMITS SAY:  \'NO TO WAR.\'  PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAD AND ARE </p><p>STILL HAVING ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS.  DESPITE ALL THIS, THE ONLY </p><p>THING THAT THE U.S. CAN THINK OF IS FABRICATING EXCUSES FOR ITS </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST IRAQ.  THE MEANING OF ALL THIS WAS SUMMARIZED BY </p><p>THE SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WHEN HE SAID:  \'IT\'S JUST ARMED </p><p>BURGLARY\' AND NOTHING ELSE.  GEORGE BUSH\'S REMARKS (INDICATING) </p><p>NO REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL AUTHORIZATION CONFIRM THIS.  THE </p><p>BURGLARY BEGINS WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE IN ARAB ISSUES.  WHAT </p><p>IS HAPPENING IN PALESTINE AND WILL HAPPEN IN IRAQ ARE GOOD </p><p>EXAMPLES OF THAT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE \'BUSH\'S COWBOY MENTALITY,\' DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCED: \'IF WE NEED TO TAKE ANY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ, WE DEFINITELY WILL, WITHOUT UN APPROVAL.\'  THE </p><p>RIGHT TRANSLATION OF THIS IS:  IF THE UN DOES NOT ABIDE BY OUR </p><p>ORDERS AND DOES NOT APPROVE THE KILLING OF IRAQ, THEN THERE IS NO </p><p>NEED FOR IT (THE UNITED NATIONS) AND EVERY MEMBER SHOULD JUST </p><p>LEAVE NEW YORK AND GO BACK TO WHERE S/HE CAME FROM ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON THE U.S. SILENCE TOWARDS THE SITUATION IN </p><p>PALESTINE, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. SILENCE TOWARDS THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE BUTCHER </p><p>SHARON AND THE GANG OF KILLERS AROUND HIM MUST BE CONSIDERED </p><p>COLLUSION.  IN FACT, CLOSING THE EYE FROM THE BLOODSHED TAKING </p><p>PLACE IN PALESTINE REPRESENTS AN ACTUAL PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>CONTINUOUS CRIME AGAINST OUR BROTHERS IN OCCUPIED PALESTINE ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON THE SUICIDE OPERATION IN HAIFA, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE HEROIC OPERATION IN HAIFA PROVED WITH NO DOUBT THAT ALL </p><p>ISRAELI GAMBLES ARE ALWAYS DOOMED TO FAILURE AND THAT NO </p><p>COLONIALIST WILL BE SAFE OR SECURE AS LONG AS THE OCCUPATION AND </p><p>ATTACKS ARE STILL GOING ON ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  DESCRIBING THE UAE INITIATIVE AS \'THE SAFE EXIT,\' ABU DHABI- </p><p>BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... IN RESPECT TO THE GIVEN FACTS, THE UAE INITIATIVE IS THE </p><p>MOST PRACTICAL PROPOSAL AND PRECIOUS ADVISE THAT COULD SAVE FACE </p><p>FOR ALL PARTIES.  IT REPRESENTS A SAFE EXIT, WHICH WILL RESCUE </p><p>EVERYONE FROM THE CRISIS.  IT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THE </p><p>SPECTER OF WAR AND DESTRUCTION FROM IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENTING ON THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS SUICIDE BOMBINGS, "AL </p><p>BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT WON\'T BE A SURPRISE IF WE ARE TOLD THAT THE BUTCHER </p><p>SHARON HAS ORDERED MORE MASSACRES AND MORE PALESTINIAN TRANSFERS </p><p>AND BANISHMENTS.  ARABS\' PREOCCUPATION WITH THE IRAQI CRISIS </p><p>SHOULD NOT MAKE THEM INADVERTENT OF THE ISRAELI CRIMES.  AN </p><p>UNIFIED ARAB MOVE TO PROTECT AND SAVE THE PALESTINIANS FROM DAILY </p><p>ANNIHILATION IS NEEDED." </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMPARING THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE RECENT OIC SUMMIT AND NAM </p><p>CONFERENCE, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/06: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>SEPARATION BETWEEN \'EVIL\', SYMBOLIZED BY U.S. AND ITS ALLIES, AND </p><p>\'GOOD\', SYMBOLIZED BY PROMOTERS OF PEACE SUCH AS FRANCE, RUSSIA, </p><p>GERMANY, AND THEIR ALLIES, IN ORDER TO CREATE A NEW MULTI-POLAR </p><p>WORLD.  THE BATTLE IS STILL AT ITS BEGINNING, SO THE ARABS AND </p><p>MUSLIMS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A SAY IN ACTIONS AND NOT IN WORDS </p><p>ONLY." </p><p> </p><p>11.  CRITICIZING THE OIC SUMMIT\'S RESOLUTIONS, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/06: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE DOHA SUMMIT FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALL OTHER ARAB AND </p><p>ISLAMIC SUMMITS IN ANNOUNCING MANY ENTHUSIASTIC RESOLUTIONS </p><p>WITHOUT A SOLUTION FOR THE COMPLICATED AND DANGEROUS ISSUES THAT </p><p>MIGHT AFFECT THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLD ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
