<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, PREL, SOCI, OAU, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OAU HIV/AIDS SUMMIT IN ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Thirty-five African heads of state attended the </p><p>Extraordinary OAU Summit on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and </p><p>Other Related Infectious Diseases held in Abuja April 26- </p><p>27.  Featured guest speakers included UN Secretary General </p><p>Koffi Annan and former President Bill Clinton.  Jerry </p><p>Rawlings, former President of Ghana, was also there.  The </p><p>purpose of the Summit was to forge a common African </p><p>understanding of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the form of the </p><p>so-called Abuja Declaration and to approve an OAU Action </p><p>Plan two months in advance of the worldwide AIDS Conference </p><p>at the UN General Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  After emotive speeches by individuals representing </p><p>persons living with AIDS, TB victims and African youth, </p><p>Secretary General Annan mounted the podium and called for a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"Marshall Plan" to combat HIV/AIDS.  He sketched the broad </p><p>outlines of a proposed five-point program and announced the </p><p>establishment of an international AIDS fund that would, if </p><p>fully funded, make available USDols 7 to 10 billion per </p><p>year to fight AIDS world-wide.  Former President Clinton </p><p>acknowledged the need for such a fund, but warned that it </p><p>could only be effective if every African Head of State </p><p>began immediately to put systems into place to ensure that </p><p>money from the fund would be effectively utilized in </p><p>national HIV/AIDS prevention programs.  Clinton recalled </p><p>how President Obasanjo embraced a woman living with </p><p>HIV/AIDS when the two Presidents attended a symposium in </p><p>Abuja in August 2000.  He said that simple act sent a </p><p>powerful message throughout Nigeria, and challenged other </p><p>leaders to follow Obasanjo\'s example.   The former </p><p>President also praised the efforts of Angola and Ghana to </p><p>de-stigmatize the disease. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The five-member official American delegation was headed </p><p>by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Nancy </p><p>Powell.  Other members included Acting Assistant </p><p>Administrator of USAID Valerie Dickson-Horton, Special </p><p>Adviser to the Secretary of Health and Human Services </p><p>Willis Morris, Director of the US Pulic Health Service </p><p>Office of HIV/AIDS Dr. Eric Goosby, and Timothy W. Smith of </p><p>State/OES.  Acting AFR/AA Dickson-Horton presented a paper </p><p>on Sustainable Resource Mobilization to Fight HIV/AIDS in </p><p>the third of four Heads-of-State panels, this one chaired </p><p>by a relatively restrained Col. Muammar Qadhafi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The "Message of Hope" Ambassador Powell was to deliver </p><p>on behalf of Secretary of State Powell and Secretary of </p><p>Health and Human Services Thompson was bumped from the </p><p>opening ceremony.  This appeared to have been an </p><p>intentional snub by lower-level conference organizers who </p><p>were disappointed at the level of U.S. representation and </p><p>that Secretary Powell did not attend.  Embassy intervention </p><p>with senior Nigerian and OAU officials succeeded in getting </p><p>the "Message" back on the program in the time slot </p><p>originally envisioned -- during the signing of the Abuja </p><p>Declaration.  The "Message" received prominent press </p><p>coverage, as did speeches by Presidents Obasanjo, Moi, </p><p>Kerekou, Eyadema and Bouteflika and former Ghanaian </p><p>President Rawlings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  In the Abuja Declaration, participating Heads of State </p><p>committed themselves to take personal responsibility and a </p><p>direct leadership role in the fight against HIV/AIDS in </p><p>their respective countries.  Most dramatically, </p><p>participants pledged to "set a target" allocation of 15 </p><p>percent of their annual budgets for "improvement of the </p><p>health sector," while "scaling up" HIV/AIDS education.  The </p><p>Declaration urges increased foreign assistance to Africa, </p><p>as well as outright debt forgiveness for the Continent, </p><p>which participants agreed to devote to "investment in the </p><p>social sector." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Abuja Framework for Action set forth concrete </p><p>objectives for arresting rates of HIV, TB and other related </p><p>infectious diseases.  The Action Plan\'s objectives call on </p><p>African leaders to: (1) adequately fund primary health </p><p>care, (2) develop national policies to combat these </p><p>diseases and to control their socio-economic side-effects, </p><p>{3) establish "sustainable mechanisms" for funding HIV </p><p>prevention and treatment, and (4) attend to the needs of </p><p>women, children, and other vulnerable segments of the </p><p>population.  The "Framework" envisages a strong role for </p><p>the OAU in monitoring individual states\' progress in </p><p>implementing their own country-specific plans, and calls on </p><p>the OAU to develop a continent-wide action plan to be </p><p>presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The only sour note in the Summit came during the "Vote </p><p>of Thanks" in the closing ceremony.  Conference organizers, </p><p>in an incredible lapse of judgment, assigned the task of </p><p>thanking the Nigerian hosts and the OAU sponsors to Col. </p><p>Qadhafi.  After five minutes of murmuring appropriate </p><p>sentiments for the occasion, the Libyan leader launched </p><p>into an anti-US diatribe, in which he accused the CIA of </p><p>developing the AIDS virus to debilitate the developing </p><p>world and create markets for US pharmaceutical "profit </p><p>mongers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  When it became apparent that Qadhafi planned to sustain </p><p>his diatribe, the official US delegation walked out, as did </p><p>the official Japanese delegation and former President </p><p>Rawlings among others.  President Obasanjo, who chaired the </p><p>closing session, appeared genuinely miffed at Qadhafi\'s </p><p>conduct.  When the Libyan President finished, Obasanjo </p><p>said, "Well, our friend and brother has made a statement; </p><p>he has made a l-o-n-g statement; and somewhere in that </p><p>statement there was also a vote of thanks."  We later heard </p><p>from numerous sources that President Obasanjo, OAU </p><p>Secretary General Salim A. Salim and many of the African </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>delegations were livid about Qadhafi\'s antics, which they </p><p>felt was a blight on an otherwise milestone Summit. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
