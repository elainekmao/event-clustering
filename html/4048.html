<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER MDC SPOKESMAN FOUND DEAD IN PRISON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Former MDC spokesman and MP Learnmore Jongwe was found </p><p>dead in his prison cell early in the morning of October 22. </p><p>Jongwe was arrested in July for fatally stabbing his wife, </p><p>and he subsequently confessed to the crime.  Jongwe had </p><p>been denied bail by both the High Court and Supreme Court, </p><p>ostensibly for fear that he would abscond.  His trial had </p><p>been scheduled for November.  (Note: In 2000, Jongwe won </p><p>his parliamentary seat in Kuwadzana -- a high-density </p><p>suburb in Harare -- with a convincing margin over his Zanu- </p><p>PF opponent:  15 691 votes to 4 349.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai released a strong press </p><p>statement expressing the party\'s shock and regret, and </p><p>saying the MDC "holds the Mugabe regime accountable for the </p><p>death of Jongwe.deaths in custody are associated with </p><p>tyrannical and oppressive regimes worldwide whose aim is to </p><p>eliminate opponents, silence critics and promote open </p><p>fascism."  The statement ends by vowing that the opposition </p><p>party "will intensify the struggle for the supremacy of the </p><p>people\'s power and sovereignty." </p><p> </p><p>3.  The MDC\'s National Youth Chairman -- and a close friend </p><p>of Jongwe -- Nelson Chamisa told us that the MDC had been </p><p>denied access to the prison since Jongwe\'s death.  He said </p><p>Jongwe\'s uncle had seen the former MDC parliamentarian at </p><p>approximately 1 pm on October 21 and that he appeared to be </p><p>in reasonable spirits at that time.  MDC MP David Coltart </p><p>told us that the party had heard unconfirmed reports that </p><p>Jongwe had been taken out of his cell yesterday and </p><p>returned last night, a report we also heard from other </p><p>reliable sources.  Coltart did not rule out suicide as a </p><p>possible cause of death but encouraged the international </p><p>community to call for an independent investigation and </p><p>autopsy.   The Director of Zimbabwe Prisons, Paradzayi </p><p>Zimondi, insisted that a "full investigation" would be </p><p>conducted, but the MDC is understandably reluctant to take </p><p>him at his word. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: It is unclear at this stage what may have </p><p>caused Jongwe\'s death or whether the GOZ may have played a </p><p>part in it.  It is interesting that reports in the </p><p>government media have failed to provide any details on the </p><p>manner in which Jongwe might have died, only that he was </p><p>found dead in his cell.  The GOZ had been using his case to </p><p>portray the MDC as a violent party, and planned to try to </p><p>further discredit the opposition party by trying Jongwe at </p><p>the same time as Tsvangirai\'s treason trial.  It thus is </p><p>not clear that the government would have had any motive for </p><p>ordering his murder.  Although the Government is determined </p><p>to gain as many parliamentary seats as possible, in an </p><p>effort to regain a two-thirds majority, Jongwe likely would </p><p>have been convicted in November and lost his parliamentary </p><p>seat in any case.   The reports -- as yet unconfirmed - </p><p>that Jongwe was taken from his cell for a number of hours </p><p>yesterday is troubling.  Until we learn more details, </p><p>however, it would be premature to speculate, but the </p><p>Department may wish to consider David Coltart\'s suggestion </p><p>that we call publicly for an independent investigation and </p><p>autopsy. </p><p> </p><p>JSULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
