<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO US CIRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KIRF, VM, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  The Prime Minister and Thich Huyen Quang </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A.  Hanoi 0809     B.  Hanoi 0631  C. Hanoi 175 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Vietnamese media, including television on April 2 </p><p>and all major newspapers including the Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam\'s flagstaff "Nhan Dan" and the military\'s "Quan Doi </p><p>Nhan Dan" on April 3, gave prominent coverage to an April 2 </p><p>meeting between Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Thich </p><p>("Most Venerable") Huyen Quang, the patriarch of the pre- </p><p>1975 United Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV).  (Note:  The </p><p>UBCV is not recognized by the GVN and several of whose </p><p>leaders -- including Thich Huyen Quang -- have been under </p><p>house/pagoda arrest for many years.  As noted in ref b, </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang was allowed to come to Hanoi in March for </p><p>medical treatment.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Media coverage of this apparently unprecedented </p><p>senior-level meeting was one-sided.  Thich Huyen Quang was </p><p>not identified apart from his name and religious title; no </p><p>reference was made to the UBCV or any prior or current </p><p>leadership role played by him.  His remarks to the Prime </p><p>Minister were not covered in the media.  Articles claimed </p><p>that he had requested the meeting and the Prime Minister had </p><p>"accepted" the request.  (Note:  According to Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang himself -- ref a -- the Ministry of Public Security </p><p>had "invited" him to remain in Hanoi for a few days because </p><p>a senior leader wished to meet him.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to media coverage, the Prime Minister </p><p>described the CPV\'s and GVN\'s policy of religious freedom in </p><p>Vietnam and urged Thich Huyen Quang to "participate actively </p><p>in making contributions" toward national development and </p><p>national solidarity. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  According to a press release from the International </p><p>Buddhist Information Bureau in Paris (an often harsh critic </p><p>of the SRV), Thich Huyen Quang spoke frankly about </p><p>limitations on religious freedom in Vietnam during his </p><p>meeting with the Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Ambassador Burghardt will be meeting with Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang in a previously scheduled appointment on April 4 </p><p>and will have the opportunity to ask more about the </p><p>background to this meeting, its contents, and Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang\'s assessment of its implications for his own future </p><p>and for the UBCV.. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment:  However welcome this meeting and </p><p>surprisingly extensive publicity are, Embassy does not </p><p>believe that this treatment of the Patriarch presages a </p><p>formal recognition of the UBCV or an end to harassment of </p><p>its leaders and followers.  Thich Huyen Quang himself, as of </p><p>April 1, still expected to have to return to his "pagoda </p><p>arrest" in Quang Ngai province shortly.  The meeting may </p><p>nonetheless reflect the GVN\'s growing recognition that its </p><p>previous more hard-line attitude toward this elderly and </p><p>still respected religious leader had only won the GVN </p><p>decades of bad publicity and years of pressure from the USG </p><p>and other international observers.  GVN leaders may also </p><p>have feared likely international condemnation had Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang died in an isolated pagoda in the country </p><p>without any GVN effort at reconciliation.  The key will be </p><p>to see whether there is any follow-on to what is so far </p><p>pretty much of a one-time phenomenon. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU ) Comment, continued:  This attempt by the CPV and </p><p>GVN to appear more positive toward religion in general is </p><p>also in line with the CPV resolution on religion issued at </p><p>the end of the second phase of the 9th CPV\'s seventh plenum </p><p>in January (ref C).  This resolution, whose full contents </p><p>were released only in March, included many tributes to the </p><p>role of religion (at least for a "small sector" of the </p><p>public) and the right of religious belief (as well as of </p><p>"non-belief"), while nonetheless coming down squarely in </p><p>favor of greater supervision of religious bodies and the </p><p>need for all religious believers to engage only in "legal" </p><p>activities and to conform their international contacts with </p><p>the foreign policy of the CPV and GVN. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
