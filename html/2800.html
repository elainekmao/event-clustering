<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 4/19/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAID, ECON, PREF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUJA ROUND-UP APRIL 8-19 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON COUNSELOR BRIAN BROWNE. REASON </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. The States\' decision to hold local </p><p>government elections May 18 has sparked controversy </p><p>and additional lawsuits which apparently the Supreme </p><p>Court will have to resolve (paras 2-4).  Canadian PM </p><p>Chretien visited Abuja for talks centering on NEPAD </p><p>and the G-8 with Obasanjo and several other African </p><p>Heads of States (paras 5-6). Former Head of State </p><p>Buhari and current Speaker of the House Na\' Abba may </p><p>be weighing their presidential prospects (paras 7-10). </p><p>Works Minister Anenih reportedly cut an "incumbents </p><p>deal" with PDP State Governors whereby the Governors </p><p>and President Obasanjo will support each other\'s </p><p>reelection (para 11).  Obasanjo\'s critics in the </p><p>National Assembly held sessions on the President\'s </p><p>alleged transgressions of the constitution (para 12). </p><p>Current rumors have Obasanjo making his reelection </p><p>announcement over the weekend (para 13).  Return of </p><p>IDPs to Taraba and Nasarawa States is not going </p><p>smoothly (para 14). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTION TURMOIL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In the wake of the March 28 Supreme Court </p><p>ruling prohibiting the National Assembly from shifting </p><p>local government elections from 2002 to 2003, the </p><p>States\' decision to hold those elections May 18 has </p><p>sparked a hornet\'s nest of political activity.  This </p><p>tight schedule will not provide sufficient time for </p><p>registration of new voters and new political parties </p><p>for the local contests.  After convening a special </p><p>joint session, the National Assembly filed suit in the </p><p>Supreme Court to bar elections on that date.  The </p><p>Assembly is arguing that, without updating the voter\'s </p><p>list and allowing for new parties to register, holding </p><p>elections in May will unconstitutionally </p><p>disenfranchise the millions of new voters who reached </p><p>voting age since the 1999 contests.  The Assembly </p><p>further contends the election effectively will </p><p>undermine freedom of association if new political </p><p>parties are not allowed to participate. Also, ten </p><p>young adults obtained an injunction against the </p><p>election in the Federal Court of Appeals on the </p><p>grounds that their right to vote will be abrogated if </p><p>they are not allowed to register and vote in the </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The political parties have also gotten into the </p><p>act.  The PDP, the party with the most resources and </p><p>already in control of most local government areas, is </p><p>relatively more prepared and better situated than the </p><p>APP and AD. Predictably, the PDP announced that the </p><p>early date suited it just fine.  However, both APP and </p><p>AD have complained about the date, threatening to file </p><p>suit themselves. While the parties continue to </p><p>complain, Embassy contacts indicate the parties are </p><p>scrabbling to prepare, in case the May 18 date holds. </p><p>Of course, the currently unregistered parties threaten </p><p>court action to postpone the election unless they can </p><p>be registered. (Note: The Independent Electoral </p><p>Commission (INEC) has announced that it will </p><p>promulgate procedures for party registration very </p><p>soon. INEC has also stated that parties hoping to </p><p>register should file a letter of intent to register </p><p>with INEC. If the procedures facilitate some sort of </p><p>"fast track" registration, the new parties may get a </p><p>break. Conversely, if the guidelines are onerous, the </p><p>new parties will probably file suit as well. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) For the second time this year, the Supreme </p><p>Court apparently will be asked to clarify and </p><p>hopefully bring a semblance of order and pragmatism to </p><p>what has become a confused, and, in part, </p><p>contradictory web of electoral laws and procedures. </p><p>Because all political stakeholders continue to be </p><p>fixated on their own limited self-interests, there is </p><p>insufficient time to have the type of prolonged </p><p>negotiations needed to script a political compromise </p><p>among the numerous state, local and national actors </p><p>that have roles in this drama. The Supreme Court seems </p><p>uniquely placed, the only institution that objectively </p><p>can weigh both the law and equities of the political </p><p>stakeholders to fashion a remedy reconciling two </p><p>constitutional imperatives: 1.) The deadline on the </p><p>tenure of local governments and 2.) The right of </p><p>citizens to participate in the electoral process, </p><p>either as voters or officer seekers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A MAPLE LEAF IN ABUJA </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Canadian PM Chretien visited Nigeria from April </p><p>4-7.  According to the Canadian High Commission in </p><p>Abuja, the meetings between Chretien and Obasanjo went </p><p>well.  Their discussions focused on NEPAD, with </p><p>Chretien using his visit to publicly and privately </p><p>emphasize human rights, rule of law and good </p><p>governance as the keys to the kingdom of private </p><p>investment and development. Build NEPAD on these </p><p>fundamentals and investors will come, Obasanjo was </p><p>told.  Obasanjo agreed, in part, recounted the </p><p>Canadian diplomat but also repined that the West </p><p>needed to be a bit more generous with the carrots and </p><p>a little less eager to wield its economic sticks. </p><p>Both Obasanjo and Chretien echoed these themes during </p><p>a lunch with the Presidents of Sierra Leone, Benin, </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire and Ghana.  During the visit, Obasanjo </p><p>thanked the Prime Minister for supporting the "wait </p><p>and see" position on Zimbabwean elections adopted at </p><p>the Commonwealth Summit in Australia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Canadian High Commission believed a </p><p>personal bond had developed between the two leaders </p><p>prior to the visit, given their many phone calls to </p><p>each other about Zimbabwe before and after the </p><p>Commonwealth Summit.  This explained the agreement to </p><p>have a 45-minute one-on-one between Obasanjo and </p><p>Chretien only.  A call on Mohammed Ibn Chambas, the </p><p>Executive Secretary of ECOWAS and his staff was </p><p>disappointing, we were told. The ECOWAS crew missed an </p><p>opportunity to woo the Canadian leader by failing to </p><p>lay out for him a glimpse of their vision for the </p><p>organization. Instead, they presented the Prime </p><p>Minister a laundry list of assistance requests without </p><p>offering a compelling reason why Canada should </p><p>consider the request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>MORE CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENCY BEGIN TO EMERGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) While President Obasanjo reportedly is close to </p><p>divulging his reelection intentions (para 14), another </p><p>former military Head of State whose surname begins </p><p>with a "B" reportedly is on the verge of announcing </p><p>his intentions. The former general is Muhammad Buhari, </p><p>not Ibrahim Babangida. According to a press statement </p><p>by the Director of a group calling itself the </p><p>"Campaign for Buhari 2003," the former leader may </p><p>announce his intention this month to join the APP and </p><p>seek its nomination. Buhari has railed that the </p><p>current Administration\'s ineptitude is steering the </p><p>country into a deep ditch.  Only a man of outstanding </p><p>caliber can save the nation from this fate, he has </p><p>said. Sound familiar? It should. Similar mots were </p><p>employed when Buhari toppled the elected Shagari </p><p>government in 1983. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Meanwhile, another son of the North, House </p><p>Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba appears to be positioning </p><p>himself as well.  Members of Na\'Abba\'s clique in the </p><p>House reportedly have started a not so quiet campaign </p><p>in that Chamber to get other members to endorse the </p><p>Speaker to challenge Obasanjo for the PDP mantle. </p><p>Other House members, not so enthralled with the </p><p>Speaker, have complained that Na\'Abba is now using his </p><p>position to advance his personal interests and not </p><p>those of the House, let alone the country\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: That Buhari and Na\'Abba hail from the </p><p>North demonstrate how much Obasanjo\'s standing in that </p><p>region has been shaken. While the noise around Buhari </p><p>and Na\'Abba shows Obasanjo\'s weakness, it does not </p><p>mean the duo from Kano will make particularly strong </p><p>candidates. Known for his mailed-fist style of </p><p>leadership as Head of State, Buhari is as a staunch </p><p>religionist who has reportedly said that Nigeria\'s </p><p>president should be a Muslim. This religious litmus </p><p>test will not sit well with Southerners. Moreover, the </p><p>other "B" Head of State, Babangida, has no love for </p><p>Buhari and would likely work against him. Buhari\'s </p><p>appeal is probably limited areas in the North but if </p><p>he chooses to run he can hurt Obasanjo in that region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment Cont. Although he has gained notoriety </p><p>during the past several months due to his running feud </p><p>with the President on various issues, Na\'Abba is still </p><p>considered a relative newcomer and a political </p><p>youngster (he is in his forties). While the Speaker </p><p>harbors ambitions, a serious Na\'Abba candidacy seems </p><p>remote. Some observers think Na\'Abba is playing </p><p>hardball now in order to soften Obasanjo so that they </p><p>can cut a deal later that would secure the Speakers </p><p>position in the House. However, veteran journalist Ben </p><p>Asante told PolCouns recently that  Na\'Abba was being </p><p>encouraged by "Northern elders" to seek every </p><p>opportunity to kick up dust in order to make </p><p>Obasanjo\'s path to PDP re-nomination less visible. </p><p>Additionally, the reports about these two candidates </p><p>being poised to enter the race may encourage others to </p><p>consider tossing their hats into the ring. This </p><p>dynamic does not bode well for pro-Obasanjo </p><p>strategists who have been working to give their boss, </p><p>at least within his own party, the aura of a consensus </p><p>candidate. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) As part of the attempt to solidify Obasanjo\'s </p><p>base in the PDP, Obasanjo\'s men met with the 20 PDP </p><p>governors last week at the home of Works Minister Tony </p><p>Anenih, Obasanjo\'s chief deal-maker.  According to the </p><p>Guardian, outspoken Abia State Governor Orji Kalu </p><p>emerged from the meeting, claiming an agreement was </p><p>struck whereby the Governors and Obasanjo would </p><p>support each other\'s reelection bids. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A FIRE IN THE HOUSE! </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Not to be outdone by Anenih, the President\'s </p><p>opponents in the National Assembly have tried to </p><p>increase the heat on Obasanjo. After the joint session </p><p>on the local elections (para 2), an ad hoc joint </p><p>committee, chaired by APP Senator Lawali Shuaibu, was </p><p>established to investigate alleged violations of the </p><p>Constitution committed by the President. The </p><p>committee\'s deliberations sparked talk of impeachment. </p><p>Although little will probably come of this, the timing </p><p>of this maneuver probably was not coincidental.  It </p><p>looks like an attempt, at the very least, to </p><p>precipitate a drizzle on the Obasanjo reelection </p><p>parade Anenih is busily organizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE OBASANJO COUNTDOWN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) While Americans were preoccupied with their </p><p>tax returns on April 15, Obasanjo was expected to </p><p>announce his intentions on that date. However, the </p><p>deadline passed without a peep from him. Now, the PDP </p><p>is reportedly organizing a rally in Abuja for April 19 </p><p>or 20. Current speculation is that Obasanjo will make </p><p>his announcement then. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>BENUE IDPS -- WHERE IS THE WELCOME WAGON? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) NGOs in Benue have informed us that the return </p><p>of mostly Tiv IDPs to their homes in Taraba and </p><p>Nasarawa states has not gone as hoped. Logistical </p><p>support for their return has been wanting in many </p><p>instances.  More importantly, "peace agreements" with </p><p>the other ethnic groups have not been reached in some </p><p>communities, causing the welcome home to be less than </p><p>warm. Newspapers report several returnees being killed </p><p>in Taraba by ethnic Jukuns. Over 50 families returned </p><p>to Agasha camp in Benue after being turn away from </p><p>their homes in Wukari, Taraba.  (Wukari is the </p><p>cultural home of the Jukun). Hundreds of IDPs returned </p><p>to Daudu and Ukpain refugee camps from their homes in </p><p>Nasarawa after an angry welcome from the other ethnic </p><p>groups there.  Reportedly, seven people were killed in </p><p>the Awe local government area. (Comment: These reports </p><p>are discomforting and will deter others from </p><p>attempting to return home. For this mostly rural </p><p>population, the inability to return home means they </p><p>will miss an important planting cycle, the </p><p>consequences of which will not only be felt now but </p><p>also when these people come up empty-handed at harvest </p><p>time. We will continue to monitor the situation. </p><p>Emboffs plan to visit the area in the near future. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
