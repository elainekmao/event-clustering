(SBU) The GOC was frustrated with the December </p><p>negotiations in Geneva and had reluctantly joined the effort </p><p>to forge a consensus with proposed language that would expand </p><p>the scope of diseases.  Dickson stated that Canada </p><p>understands the US\' position on this issue, especially given </p><p>the large research-based pharmaceutical industry in the US. </p><p>She recognizes that the US moratorium may be a useful interim </p><p>step, but noted that "for tactical reasons" Canada would not </p><p>follow suit with a moratorium of their own at this point. </p><p>The GOC remains committed to a multilateral solution and will </p><p>continue to work with the US and other nations.  Pettigrew is </p><p>drafting an official reply to Zoellick\'s letter, and Dickson </p><p>promised to share a copy with the Embassy. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
