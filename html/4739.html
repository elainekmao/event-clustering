<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003324 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 12/15/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, IV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO COOL TO PARIS SUMMIT ON </p><p>COTE D\'IVOIRE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 256597 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F.JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) I spoke at length by phone on Saturday evening </p><p>with President Obasanjo on the French proposal to hold </p><p>a summit on Cote d\'Ivoire.  Obasanjo is opposed and I </p><p>think adamantly so, to the French proposal.  He said </p><p>that, if invited, he would not attend. "They can hold </p><p>the summit, but I am not going; Nigeria will not be </p><p>represented," he bluntly declared.  Cote d\'Ivoire, he </p><p>contended, is an African problem that must be solved </p><p>by African leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Anticipating my question, a more statesmanlike </p><p>Obasanjo expressed gratitude to France (and the U.S.) </p><p>for helping to broker a meeting with Cameroonian </p><p>President Biya. However, Obasanjo added that he had </p><p>told Biya at their meeting in Geneva that he would not </p><p>meet again outside of the African continent, or for </p><p>that matter, outside of Cameroon or Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) I explained the French were not trying to </p><p>overshadow ECOWAS peacemaking efforts, but rather they </p><p>conceived the summit as a logical extension of the </p><p>Lome peace process and as a way to inject it with </p><p>needed momentum.  Obasanjo, however, would have none </p><p>of it.  Instead, he inferred the French proposal was </p><p>Wade\'s idea because Wade was unhappy with Eyadema. The </p><p>French need to support the Lome process, not displace </p><p>it, he stressed.  Obasanjo said would he raise this </p><p>objection with Wade when they meet on December 16. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Obasanjo said a number of regional leaders had </p><p>called him to ask that he engage on Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>The Ivorian Prime Minister had also visited Abuja to </p><p>ask that he intercede.  Obasanjo said he had agreed, </p><p>and that first he was going to Kara to try to heal the </p><p>rift between Wade and Edayema.  Wade and Kufuor would </p><p>join him there.  Eyadema, he said, felt very badly </p><p>about the distance that had developed between himself </p><p>and Wade.  From Kara, Obasanjo said he and the three </p><p>other leaders would go to Cote d\'Ivoire to meet </p><p>Gbagbo.  They would tell Gbagbo that ending the </p><p>rebellion would necessitate political compromise </p><p>because the essential problems were political not </p><p>military. The region would help if he wanted it; if </p><p>not, the region would stand aside. Obasanjo </p><p>emphasized, however, that if Gbagbo refused this offer </p><p>of assistance, Gbagbo himself would lose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) I told the President that my impression was </p><p>the real leaders of the rebellion were not those who </p><p>were negotiating in Lome.  Obasanjo agreed.  He </p><p>recounted telling Eyadema he was wasting his time </p><p>negotiating with "sergeants" in Lome; instead, he </p><p>would have to "go behind the masks" and find out who </p><p>the real leaders might be, but agreed that Ouattara, </p><p>Bedie, and Guei\'s successor all needed to be at the </p><p>table. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) As our conversation ended, I told Obasanjo </p><p>that we recognized the domestic imperatives he faces, </p><p>but his engagement on Cote d\' Ivoire could be </p><p>instrumental.  Obasanjo said Nigeria is willing to </p><p>engage and is even willing to send troops "under the </p><p>right conditions."  However, Nigeria would only engage </p><p>if asked; even then, it would want to avoid the </p><p>perception of being the region\'s primary policeman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Obasanjo promised to brief me on his return to </p><p>Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The timing of the French initiative is </p><p>unfortunate from the Nigerian perspective.  The idea </p><p>comes just as the Nigerians are revving up to assume a </p><p>more active role in the mediation process.  In the </p><p>back of his mind, Obasanjo probably feels the Paris </p><p>summit was intended, at least in part, to limit </p><p>Nigeria\'s role and to underscore that France not </p><p>Nigeria or even ECOWAS remains the main underwriter of </p><p>security in Francophone West Africa. Second, despite </p><p>Obasanjo\'s "gratefulness" to the French for brokering </p><p>the meeting with Biya, Paris is not </p><p>the GON\'s favorite foreign capital at the moment. </p><p>Obasanjo still smarts from the ICJ decision on Bakassi </p><p>that many Nigerians believe the French played an </p><p>unhelpful role in crafting. He clearly does not want </p><p>to be seen as legitimizing the French by returning to </p><p>the scene of the notorious September 5 meeting where </p><p>he is reported to have agreed to implement the ICJ </p><p>ruling(the GON denies he made the commitment). Right </p><p>now, a trip to Paris might not play well with the </p><p>Nigerian public. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
