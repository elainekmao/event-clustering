He also inserted a note of solidarity with the U.S. </p><p>on preventing terror while continuing to state opposition to </p><p>the war in Iraq, supporting Saleh\'s statement supports post\'s </p><p>expectation that the President is keen to prevent further </p><p>unauthorized demonstrations getting out of control. </p><p> </p><p>-- At a 3/22 meeting with MOI Brigadier General Sunaidar, DCM </p><p>expressed appreciation for security provided during the </p><p>demonstration and condolences for Yemeni deaths and injuries. </p><p> Sunaidar said he would participate in questioning those </p><p>arrested, and noted that one detained instigator of the 3/21 </p><p>demonstration is a leading figure in Yemeni\'s chapter of the </p><p>Iraqi Baath Party. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post received further information early 3/22 about the </p><p>location of the Yemeni Ambassador\'s residence in Baghdad </p><p>after weeks of requests by the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>-- EAC met at 1400 to discuss the security situation.  Key </p><p>offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: </p><p>AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC </p><p>YEMEN, FPD and RMO.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>President Saleh\'s Strong Statement </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On Yemeni television and published prominently in </p><p>the government daily al-Thawra, President Saleh issued a </p><p>statement after his National Defense Council and Higher </p><p>Security Committee meeting calling the 3/21 demonstration </p><p>illegal and condemning the violence.  He also said he would </p><p>not allow unauthorized demonstrations and combined sympathy </p><p>for the Iraqi and Palestinian peoples with the American </p><p>people after 9/11.  Text of statement, as translated by FBIS </p><p>and Embassy, in paragraph 14. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In a message from Saleh, senior Presidential Advisor </p><p>Mohamed Sudam told the Ambassador that opposition parties </p><p>were responsible for the violence at the demonstration. </p><p>Several parties, including the Iraqi Baathis, Nasserites and </p><p>al-Haq, were involved and a Baathi leader was the first to </p><p>speak at Tahrir Square.  Sudam said that Islah party members </p><p>were also involved at the beginning of the demonstration, but </p><p>"faded away" long before the demonstration moved to the area </p><p>near the Embassy and turned violent.  He also said the </p><p>General Prosecutor will investigate and prosecute those </p><p>responsible. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MinInterior Response </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DCM, accompanied by Consul and RSO, met with </p><p>Brigadier General Sunaidar, Office Director for the Minister </p><p>of Interior 3/22.  Sunaidar said he will participate in </p><p>questioning those arrested in the demonstrations, starting </p><p>afternoon 3/22.  They will focus initially on those who spoke </p><p>to and stirred up the crowd in order to get the demonstration </p><p>moving.  Sunaidar indicated they do not have a full list yet </p><p>of those arrested, but one of them he identified as a leading </p><p>figure in Yemen\'s relatively small chapter of the Iraqi Baath </p><p>party.  DCM passed Ambassador\'s thanks to the Minister and </p><p>appreciation for Saleh\'s statement.  DCM inferred, in light </p><p>of President\'s remarks, that the authorities will be </p><p>anticipating any further unauthorized demonstrations, and </p><p>that they will be prepared to deal with them more quickly. </p><p>Sunaidar indicated he did not know of express orders to this </p><p>effect, but agreed that indeed it was likely the authorities </p><p>will move quickly to head off unauthorized demonstrators. </p><p>The list of American citizens in Yemen requested by the MOI </p><p>to provide better security was also discussed, and Sunaidar </p><p>requested the list in Arabic which Embassy will provide. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Sunaidar said that the actions of the security </p><p>forces were their "duty" and they were prepared to do it </p><p>again.  In terms of security enhancements, more personnel and </p><p>hardware have been provided and higher restrictions on </p><p>movement instituted.  He also requested assistance from the </p><p>USG in training its riot police on more efficient tactics for </p><p>crowd control, including training for personnel and provision </p><p>of equipment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Below the President\'s statement in al-Thawra, an </p><p>article quoting a source from the Ministry of Interior was </p><p>published.  Text of statement, as translated by Embassy, in </p><p>paragraph 15. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>After-Midnight MFA Visit: </p><p>Finally Providing Baghdad Coordinates </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  After two months in DIA channels and more than </p><p>three weeks through MFA channels, MFA finally responded to </p><p>Embassy request for more precise information on the Yemeni </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence in Baghdad.  While no one had the GPS </p><p>coordinates, the MFA sent someone who knew Baghdad well to </p><p>the Embassy at 0115 Saturday 3/22 to find the residence. </p><p>After poring over satellite photos for more than 45 minutes, </p><p>the location was pinpointed.  More follow up will be </p><p>conducted if additional maps and photos are obtained. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  The Yemeni Ambassador to Iraq was recalled and is </p><p>in Sanaa, although other Yemeni diplomats remain in the </p><p>Baghdad residence.  Official Saba news agency reported 3/20 </p><p>that the Yemeni embassy in Baghdad would remain open to </p><p>provide consular services and assistance to Yemenis wishing </p><p>to return home. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Embassy Standing Fast; </p><p>EAC Meeting 1400 local March 22 </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  Embassy personnel remained at StandFast and EAC </p><p>agreed to maintain StandFast at least through an EAC meeting </p><p>on March 23 to assess the situation.  All was quiet during </p><p>the night, and watchstanders detected no untoward activity </p><p>around the perimeter.  ORCA reported no new threats. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  EAC discussed in detail each tripwire that might </p><p>warrant a change in Embassy security posture.  EAC agreed </p><p>that a few tripwires, including killings of Americans, </p><p>demonstrations not controlled by ROYG, mosque sermons </p><p>inciting anti-Americanism, serious Yemeni casualties in the </p><p>suppression of demonstrations and a U.S. attack on an Arab </p><p>country, bear close watch.  EAC members concurred that no </p><p>tripwire has been crossed to date, and that possible </p><p>recurrence of violent demonstrations posed greatest present </p><p>risk of a wire being tripped.  EAC consensus was not to </p><p>recommend a request for authorized departure at this time. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Media Reaction </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Official daily al-Thawra ran President Saleh\'s </p><p>statement and the MOI\'s statement prominently on the front </p><p>page.  Reporting on the demonstration was placed on page </p><p>three and was factual and not inflammatory.  The editorial </p><p>called for "national responsibility" to "confront any </p><p>attempts that might destabilize the internal front." </p><p>English-language newspaper Yemen Observer 3/22 did not report </p><p>on the demonstration, concentrating on Iraq and the upcoming </p><p>parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  International television press, including CNN, </p><p>al-Jazeera and MBC, reported the demonstration and showed </p><p>footage of the 12-year old boy who was killed.  In an </p><p>interview with its Sanaa-based correspondent, Al Jazeera said </p><p>that the security forces showed restraint in responding to </p><p>stonethrowers and small arms fire.  International written </p><p>press reported widely on the violent Sanaa demonstrations, </p><p>although usually as a lead for a lengthier article on </p><p>demonstrations throughout the region and the world. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  CNN has run repeated ticker-line reports and other </p><p>accounts estimating demonstrators at 30,000.  This is a huge </p><p>exaggeration of the 5-7,000 marchers and the 6-800 hard core </p><p>demonstrators who remained to clash with police once violence </p><p>began. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Text of ROYG Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Text of President Saleh statement: </p><p> </p><p>In the name of God, the most beneficent, the merciful.  The </p><p>holding of this meeting, which includes members of members of </p><p>the National Defense Council and the Higher Security </p><p>Committee comes in the context of addressing ourselves to </p><p>today\'s incident which took place after Friday prayers. The </p><p>incident was accompanied by chaos. The demonstrators headed </p><p>for both the northern and Western region in the direction of </p><p>the U.S. embassy. </p><p> </p><p>The demonstration, with much regret, resulted in the death of </p><p>a number of victims, a child and citizen, and 14 security </p><p>personnel, as well as nine civilians were injured. </p><p> </p><p>We regret this painful incident. We are of the view that the </p><p>people of Yemen had expressed their views in open and clear </p><p>manner in the demonstrations they held last Saturday (15 </p><p>March). The demonstrations were held in the capital, Sanaa, </p><p>provincial and some districts headquarters. The </p><p>demonstrations expressed the opinion of the people of Yemen </p><p>and their political stand, at the official (government), </p><p>people\'s and party levels. </p><p> </p><p>We expressed our opinion of objecting to the war against </p><p>Iraq. We also expressed our view regarding what the Arab </p><p>nation of Palestine was facing, ranging from killings, </p><p>terrorism and cleansing. </p><p> </p><p>We consider today\'s incident, as announced through reports by </p><p>the security organs, a violation of the law.   As for today\'s </p><p>incident we consider it as a shortcoming and a disruption of </p><p>national security, despite the fact that government and </p><p>people\'s opinions are in agreement, contrary to other Arab </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>There are three considerations upon which we have expressed </p><p>our position.  We expressed opposition to the war against </p><p>Iraq,  we condemned the torture and terrorism of the people </p><p>of Palestine, and we have condemned the terrorist actions </p><p>which are directed against the United States and directed </p><p>against the nation of Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>In this country, the constitution, law and order govern us. </p><p>Any demonstration by any political group in this country </p><p>should adhere to the law and seek permission. Any political </p><p>group has the right of expressing its opinion peacefully. But </p><p>if it happens that this is unlawful and foolish and if it </p><p>harms the security of the nation, it does not aid anyone </p><p>except the enemies of the nation and does not aid the </p><p>foundation of Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the terrible situation in Iraq, this is indeed </p><p>frightful and scary. However, we as Yemenis and as Arab </p><p>Muslims aren\'t the only ones that have been harmed or </p><p>suffered pain. The whole world is harmed by what has resulted </p><p>from this disaster. </p><p> </p><p>We all generally object to the war against Iraq and what the </p><p>Palestinian people are facing. We all condemn terrorist </p><p>activities against the United States of America and against </p><p>our country and against the lands of the Arabs and the </p><p>Muslims and what has happened to the Palestinians. This </p><p>position is agreed upon, by all of us, even those who have </p><p>different views and different politics. </p><p> </p><p>End of Text. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Text of al-Thawra article quoting MOI source: </p><p> </p><p>A well placed source in the Ministry of Interior told Saba </p><p>news agency that the massive demonstration resulted after </p><p>Friday prayers, did not have permission to conduct a </p><p>demonstration from the Ministry of Interior, thus breaking </p><p>the law. Furthermore, the security forces defended against </p><p>the demonstrations through the march that occurred through </p><p>the streets of the capital that approached the American </p><p>Embassy. The demonstrators were trying to take control of the </p><p>Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>Some riotous elements among the demonstrators concealing arms </p><p>started to fire randomly, a behavior that prompted the </p><p>policemen to fire upward and disperse the crowd with tear gas </p><p>and water hoses. </p><p> </p><p>The source added, "14 policemen were injured, three </p><p>critically, two demonstrators were killed and nine injured." </p><p>The source explained that security authorities managed to </p><p>hold some demonstrators suspected of firing their weapons, </p><p>committing vandalism acts on cars and other properties </p><p>belonging to citizens and they will be brought to court. </p><p> </p><p>And at the end of his presentation, the source encouraged all </p><p>of the brotherly citizens to express their ideas peacefully </p><p>and far from the acts of hooliganism and to govern themselves </p><p>with the order and law that are in the interests of the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>End Text of article. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
