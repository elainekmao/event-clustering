Officials of Environment Canada and the Department of </p><p>Fisheries and Oceans expect a public rollout of a draft </p><p>framework for managing Alien Invasive Species in autumn </p><p>2003.  There may not be much meat on the bones of the draft </p><p>strategy, and a year of consultations and further drafting </p><p>will be required before the framework takes its final form. </p><p>On the other hand, existing law and regulation does provide </p><p>significant scope for action and the GoC intends to focus on </p><p>achieving near-term results within the existing statutory </p><p>and funding framework.  These GoC interlocutors have set a </p><p>high priority on establishing a shared "binational" set of </p><p>priorities for dealing with Alien Invasive Species and would </p><p>like to meet with American counterparts very soon (perhaps </p><p>as early as late August), to begin to establish a strategy </p><p>that will work for both governments.  Post strongly supports </p><p>this initiative and recommends that Washington agencies </p><p>enter into a more intensive dialogue as soon as possible. </p><p>Beginning that dialogue now will allow the U.S. to influence </p><p>development of the Canadian draft framework and lay a </p><p>foundation for more detailed work once pending legislation </p><p>in the U.S has been adopted.  End Summary and Action </p><p>Request. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The GoC made a pledge in 1992, when it signed the United </p><p>Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to prevent </p><p>and/or control Alien Invasive Species.  The problem, </p><p>however, according to the Commissioner of Environment and </p><p>Sustainable Development (part of the GoC Auditor General\'s </p><p>organization), is that this commitment (and the 1995 </p><p>Canadian Biodiversity Strategy it precipitated) have not </p><p>triggered any concrete action.  In an October 2002 report, </p><p>the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable </p><p>Development characterized federal government efforts to deal </p><p>with the Alien Invasive Species (AIS) issue as being in </p><p>disarray, with "no clear understanding of who will do what </p><p>to respond" and noting that "no federal department sees the </p><p>big picture or has overarching authority to ensure that </p><p>federal priorities are established and action taken." </p><p>Nevertheless, Canada indicated in its second national report </p><p>to the CBD in 2002, that "federal, provincial and </p><p>territorial governments have agreed that the development of </p><p>a Canadian strategy to address alien invasive species is a </p><p>national priority." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Embassy ESTH Counselor, ESTH Specialist and Intern met </p><p>with representatives from Environment Canada and the </p><p>Department of Fisheries and Oceans on July 30th to discuss </p><p>progress in the Canadian effort to develop a national </p><p>strategy, to discuss the extent of bilateral cooperation on </p><p>AIS and to elicit GoC views on how to foster further </p><p>integration of Canada-U.S. efforts, including their views of </p><p>a potential reference to the IJC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>----- </p><p>EC and DFO Officials acknowledge slow start - but plan is </p><p>coming </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  Emboffs met Robert Mclean, Acting Director General, </p><p>Conservation Strategies Directorate, Environment Canada </p><p>along with George Enei, Director, Conservation Priorities </p><p>and Planning Branch, and Mark Hovorka, Scientific Advisor in </p><p>that Branch.  Sylvain Paradis, Director of the DFO </p><p>Environmental Science Group, represented the Department of </p><p>Fisheries and Oceans. </p><p> </p><p>5.  McLean, who led the discussion for the Canadian side, </p><p>acknowledged the long lag between the commitment made in the </p><p>CBD and mid-September 2003 when a targeted action plan, the </p><p>"National Invasive Species Management and Policy Framework" </p><p>as it is tentatively referred to, will be outlined for </p><p>federal, provincial and territorial ministers.  McLean </p><p>anticipates that the Framework will be unveiled in a public </p><p>rollout as a "White Paper" (i.e., draft public policy) in </p><p>autumn 2003 shortly after the briefing to ministers.  This </p><p>will be followed by a period of seeking stakeholder and </p><p>broad public comment and a final, official, Policy Framework </p><p>in place around autumn 2004. </p><p> </p><p>6.  McLean underscored that although the Framework is still </p><p>under construction, the priorities contained in the nascent </p><p>plan reflect the views of the provincial, territorial and </p><p>federal ministers responsible for the environment, for </p><p>forests and for fisheries.  Obtaining consensus for the </p><p>priorities was facilitated by the fact that the provincial </p><p>and federal ministers in each of the three domains meet </p><p>annually in Coordinating Councils, and since 2001 the three </p><p>Councils have held a joint meeting on biodiversity.  The one </p><p>major set of ministries that has been missing from the joint </p><p>meetings on biodiversity has been Agriculture.  McLean did </p><p>not elaborate on why the Agriculture ministries were not </p><p>part of that process (there is indeed a Joint federal- </p><p>provincial Council of Ministers of Agriculture who clearly </p><p>could have participated in the biodiversity meetings), but </p><p>indicated they are a major player that needs to be engaged </p><p>in the national framework process.  Even at this late stage, </p><p>however, there is much work still to be done.  For example, </p><p>it is not clear to GoC officials, what form the political </p><p>governance structure will take, it may or may not emulate </p><p>the U.S. National Invasive Species Council. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In this same vein, the GoC has not yet done an </p><p>assessment on the need for new statutory instruments. </p><p>McLean noted that there are a number of existing statutes </p><p>and regulations, both federal and provincial that can be </p><p>employed to address the AIS threat (to be reported septel). </p><p>Moreover, he contends that in order to demonstrate to the </p><p>senior political and bureaucratic leaders in the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s Office and Privy Council Office that the </p><p>objectives of the Invasive Species Framework are credible </p><p>and "deliverable" it will be imperative that GoC agencies </p><p>make progress employing the existing mandates and agency </p><p>programs to address high profile invasive species problems </p><p>(such as Asian Carp) in the near term. </p><p> </p><p>8.  McLean also noted that in addition to the ministerial </p><p>level engagement, federal-provincial working level groups </p><p>are engaged in the development of the plan.  Given the </p><p>division of powers in Canada between the federal and </p><p>provincial orders of government (to be reported septel), </p><p>Mclean highlighted the high degree of challenge in producing </p><p>a coordinated set of actions with respect to AIS.  As just </p><p>one example, provinces are responsible for management of </p><p>fish stocks whereas the federal government has jurisdiction </p><p>in regulating and managing fish habitat.  Thus banning </p><p>possession of live Asian Carp (an emerging federal </p><p>objective) will require enacting provincial law and </p><p>regulation. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Our GoC interlocutors emphasized that the message from </p><p>the provinces is that the federal government should focus on </p><p>policies for prevention rather than dealing with remediation </p><p>and already established AIS.  For many established invasive </p><p>pest species (excluding perhaps Sea Lampreys in the Great </p><p>Lakes, for which a comprehensive plan and funding has been </p><p>in place for decades) our GoC interlocutors noted that there </p><p>is no clear road ahead and that it will probably be the </p><p>provinces that have to lead this effort.  Comment: The </p><p>provinces will, however, be looking to the federal </p><p>government to help fund their efforts at remediation. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  McLean commented that if GoC agencies can produce </p><p>tangible success in the near-term on AIS, the issue is well- </p><p>situated to gain a higher profile in the GoC as a new Prime </p><p>Minister takes over the government in February 2004, perhaps </p><p>even earlier.  And an election is widely expected in the </p><p>spring.  Comment: It can be safely assumed that there will </p><p>be many competing priorities for the attention, and the </p><p>budget, of the new government.  Without a formal policy </p><p>statement of the priorities of Paul Martin, widely </p><p>anticipated to be the next PM, it is difficult to judge </p><p>whether McLean\'s hope is justified.  Indeed, a review of </p><p>Martin\'s public statements over the past year has not </p><p>revealed any reference to Alien Invasive Species.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Bilateral cooperation requires much greater coordination </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  McLean noted that there has been long-standing </p><p>bilateral cooperation on AIS, for example with respect to </p><p>the Sea Lamprey problem in the Great lakes, and more </p><p>generally, on AIS important to agriculture and forestry. </p><p>But cooperation has typically been ad hoc, species and </p><p>project specific, agency-to-agency and regional in focus </p><p>rather than as a coordinated overall approach guided by a </p><p>shared bilateral set of priorities.  McLean and Enei noted </p><p>the desire of the EC Assistant Deputy Minister (Karen Brown) </p><p>responsible for AIS that those senior officials responsible </p><p>for AIS policy should meet very soon to begin working on a </p><p>set of shared bi-national priorities.  The outcomes of this </p><p>meeting (or series of meetings) could feed into our </p><p>bilateral consultations on a reference to the IJC, should </p><p>the U.S and Canadian governments deem that mandate </p><p>desirable. </p><p> </p><p>12.  With respect to the expected IJC reference, GoC </p><p>officials emphasize that clear and tangible goals for the </p><p>IJC effort are required.  In their opinion "new money" for </p><p>the IJC effort will not be allocated from the Treasury, </p><p>rather an IJC effort will likely be funded from existing </p><p>departmental budgets.  Without a clear, tangible and "value- </p><p>added" goal, GoC agencies will resist ponying up the cash. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Mclean agreed with ESTH Counselor\'s suggestion that it </p><p>would be beneficial to have a catalogue/inventory of </p><p>existing collaborative efforts on AIS, but the GoC </p><p>representatives admitted that they have not compiled any </p><p>such inventory.  They indicated it is something they intend </p><p>to construct, but gave no timeline.  Comment: Post strongly </p><p>believes that an inventory of areas in which the two </p><p>governments already collaborate would be very valuable and </p><p>would appreciate receiving such information if it already </p><p>exists with Washington agencies.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>IJC Views provide their comment of GoC effort </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  ESTH staff sought the views of the International Joint </p><p>Commission to provide an assessment of developments in </p><p>Canada.  James Houston, Environmental Advisor at the Ottawa </p><p>office of the International Joint Commission (IJC) told </p><p>Emboffs that political awareness of the Invasive Species </p><p>issue has grown markedly in the past 18 to 24 months; he </p><p>pointed to the role that Canadian IJC Co-Chair Herb Gray has </p><p>played since coming to the IJC in January 2002 to champion </p><p>GoC engagement in addressing the problem.  Houston </p><p>reiterated that the key problem in Canada has been lack of </p><p>accountability.  Over the past decade GoC ministries have </p><p>simply passed the buck on AIS, he emphasized that a critical </p><p>component therefore of any new framework is to have a strong </p><p>governance system.  Houston pointed to the management </p><p>structure described by the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy </p><p>of February 2000 as an example of what might work, but he </p><p>noted that Chairman Gray is an advocate of the American NISC </p><p>governance model. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action requests </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The key message provided by our GoC interlocutors is </p><p>that they view it as essential for USG and GoC senior </p><p>officials responsible for AIS to meet very soon to begin </p><p>crafting a shared set of priorities.  More generally a </p><p>bilateral meeting will also help our GoC interlocutors to </p><p>flesh out the draft Framework and give us a chance to </p><p>influence its development.  The Autumn 2003 timeline for </p><p>unveiling the draft Framework (as a policy White Paper) to </p><p>the public for input and comment may well be met, but it </p><p>remains to be seen how substantive it may actually be. </p><p>According to McLean (1) the federal and provincial </p><p>agriculture ministries have not been engaged in the </p><p>development of the draft plan; (2) no assessment has yet </p><p>been done to determine whether any new statutory instruments </p><p>are required; and (3) the governance structure to oversee </p><p>the implementation of the plan, a critical element, is still </p><p>undetermined.  Our GoC interlocutors did not explicitly </p><p>state this, but one presumes they believe that the public </p><p>consultation process and final drafting scheduled for the </p><p>period Autumn 2003 to Autumn 2004 will fill in these </p><p>details. </p><p> </p><p>16.  ACTION REQUEST: We understand that McLean or Enei </p><p>expects very soon to arrange with Lori Williams, Executive </p><p>Director of the National Invasive Species Council setting a </p><p>meeting of GoC and USG policy officials with AIS </p><p>responsibilities.  We understand that the target date for </p><p>the meeting is late August or early September.  Post would </p><p>appreciate details of the meeting agenda and USG </p><p>participants once those are available.  The embassy intends </p><p>to be fully engaged on this issue and wishes to contribute </p><p>to the bilateral effort.  In that vein, we believe that an </p><p>inventory of collaboration between U.S and Canada Ian </p><p>agencies would be useful and request that the department </p><p>provide such information if it is available. </p><p> </p><p>Kelly </p><p></p></div>
