According to MORAD, more than 1,000 families have returned </p><p>to their villages in southern Arbil governorate; one week ago the </p><p>number was 313.  The most critical need in these villages is </p><p>water.  There are between 130,000 and 140,000 MT of wheat (of </p><p>unknown quality) currently in MOT stores in Kirkuk, but, </p><p>according to WFP, several issues need to be addressed before the </p><p>PDS is resumed: security, MOT infrastructure, and MOT salaries. </p><p>According to the Ministry of Health in As Sulaymaniyah, health </p><p>priorities include vaccines, drugs, suturing materials, </p><p>communicable diseases, and training.  UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq </p><p>Coordinator is advocating that IDPs not return to their home </p><p>villages at this time.  However, UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq </p><p>Coordinator also stressed to the DART the importance of helping </p><p>those who have already returned and recognized that returns will </p><p>likely continue despite best efforts to delay them.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MORAD) hosted </p><p>a coordination meeting on 10 May in Arbil.  The DART, non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations </p><p>(IOs), and the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance (ORHA) were in attendance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Minister began the meeting by providing an update on the </p><p>situation in southern Arbil Governorate.  The Ministry led a tour </p><p>to that region earlier in the week to show humanitarian workers </p><p>those villages they hope to see repopulated by Kurdish IDPs.  The </p><p>Minister stated there are now more than 1,000 families that have </p><p>returned to their villages, while one week ago the number was </p><p>313. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Emergency needs for these returnees were discussed, with </p><p>water being the most important.  Thirteen villages are said to be </p><p>in urgent need of water.  The United Nations Children\'s Fund </p><p>(UNICEF) stated that using water tankers to bring water into </p><p>villages was the most practical method for meeting short-term </p><p>needs.  Shelter needs were also discussed, with UNOPS, REACH (a </p><p>local NGO), and Peace Winds Japan offering to look at the </p><p>provision of tents. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A representative from the Ministry of Humanitarian Aid and </p><p>Cooperation (MOHAC) stated that MOHAC is assessing the needs of </p><p>returnees and that an additional 966 IDP families, living in the </p><p>Duhok area, want to return to southern Arbil Governorate.  The </p><p>NGOs and IOs present were asked to assist in the IDPs\' return. </p><p> </p><p>6.  An ORHA representative stated that everyone must be cautious </p><p>about encouraging IDP movements.  She said that the interim </p><p>authority must establish itself so that proper processes for </p><p>land, property, and other return issues can be addressed </p><p>properly.  The ORHA representative also stated that the Kurdish </p><p>Regional Government (KRG) was not in charge of some areas where </p><p>IDPs wished to return, such as Kirkuk and Mosul, and that "we are </p><p>not in the process of moving boundaries."  The Minister responded </p><p>to these remarks by saying that such issues should be brought up </p><p>at a higher political level and not in an NGO coordination </p><p>meeting.  The ORHA representative then said that ORHA would have </p><p>preferred that those IDPs who already returned to their villages </p><p>had not done so. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A discussion ensued about whether or not providing assistance </p><p>to returnees would encourage others to return and, therefore, </p><p>whether or not assistance should be limited.  Several NGO and IO </p><p>representatives told ORHA that the humanitarian agencies would </p><p>provide aid if needed and that people would return to their </p><p>villages regardless of politics.  MORAD reiterated the need to </p><p>assist returnees. </p><p> </p><p>(Comment: This rather tense discussion generated necessary debate </p><p>about the IDP and returnee issue in northern Iraq.  The pressure </p><p>- real or perceived - on IDPs to repopulate regions south of the </p><p>green line will affect the political dynamics in this part of </p><p>Iraq.  How the international community, especially ORHA, reacts </p><p>to this issue could have profound effects on the politics in </p><p>northern Iraq.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>WFP LOGISTICS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The DART met with WFP\'s logistics coordinator in Arbil, on 10 </p><p>May, to discuss WFP capacity and its plans to step up the Public </p><p>Distribution System (PDS) in Mosul and Kirkuk.  With between </p><p>130,000 and 140,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat (of unknown </p><p>quality) currently in Ministry of Trade (MOT) stores in Kirkuk, </p><p>and possibly 250,000 MT (also of unknown quality) in Mosul, </p><p>WFP/Logistics sees its first priority as cleaning out and making </p><p>minor repairs to silos and MOT warehouses.  This includes milling </p><p>good grain, removing bad grain, and making storage complexes able </p><p>to absorb the upcoming harvest.  WFP reports that cooperation </p><p>with MOT staff in Kirkuk has been good, and they will soon begin </p><p>collaborating in Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP noted that there are several issues that need to be </p><p>addressed as the PDS is resumed: security, MOT infrastructure, </p><p>and MOT salaries.  Regarding security, Coalition forces are </p><p>guarding WFP warehouses in Mosul, and have arranged for local </p><p>police to guard WFP and MOT warehouses in Kirkuk.  WFP is very </p><p>pleased with Coalition support, and they say Coalition-provided </p><p>local security in Kirkuk is helping strengthen the MOT\'s </p><p>confidence. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WFP will not re-equip looted MOT offices (they say this is </p><p>ORHA\'s job), but they will assist in silo and warehouse cleaning </p><p>and repairs (beginning Monday in Kirkuk) and provide some MOT </p><p>food staff office infrastructure at these complexes.   WFP states </p><p>it will play a role in minor repair of storage infrastructure, </p><p>but that ORHA needs to support major repair and MOT office </p><p>equipment.  Salaries are still a big issue as MOT employees in </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk have yet to be paid the emergency USD 20 </p><p>stipend, let alone a formal salary.  Some employees of other </p><p>sectors, including railway staff and teachers for example, have </p><p>apparently been paid informally.  (Comment: It would be </p><p>beneficial to inform government personnel when and how much they </p><p>will be paid.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP is now able to travel on a daily basis to Kirkuk and </p><p>Mosul, although Mosul is still classified by the U.N. as Phase IV </p><p>security.  WFP will soon have at least two international staff </p><p>based in Mosul (program and logistics) and at least one </p><p>international logistics officer in Kirkuk.  WFP will concentrate </p><p>on getting things moving with MOT infrastructure and staff in </p><p>Kirkuk, and then focus on Mosul in the coming days.  WFP reported </p><p>that Tikrit is the only area to which no food has yet been </p><p>delivered. Tikrit is still Phase V security, and the U.N. </p><p>Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) has not yet visited.  Given the </p><p>present security situation and restricted travel to Baghdad, WFP </p><p>envisions its staff gradually expanding its areas of operation </p><p>from the Kuwaiti border north to Baghdad and from Arbil south to </p><p>Baghdad. Therefore, Tikrit will likely be accessed, at least </p><p>initially, from the north. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>AS SULAYMANIYAH MINITRY OF HEALTH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The DART visited the Ministry of Health in As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>on 11 May.  The deputy minister and several directors provided a </p><p>general overview of the health system in As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>Governorate.  Primary health care, vaccinations, nutrition, </p><p>malaria prevention, mobile health monitoring, and health </p><p>education programs were discussed, as was the relationship </p><p>between the Ministry and U.N. organizations. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Ministry officials state that health priorities include </p><p>vaccines, drugs, suturing materials, communicable diseases, and </p><p>training.  Vaccine supply schedules have been erratic and, as a </p><p>result, often arrive with a short shelf life.  Certain drugs and </p><p>other supplies are in short supply, and doctors are worried that </p><p>the supply pipeline will not open before current supplies are </p><p>exhausted.  Communicable diseases are a major worry as summer </p><p>approaches; waterborne diseases and malaria are also of concern. </p><p>Training and general motivation of staff are other concerns in </p><p>the medical community.  In the very near future, there will be </p><p>heavy demand for training programs in all health care sectors. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>UNHCR\'s IDP ROLE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The DART met with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees\' </p><p>(UNHCR) Northern Iraq Coordinator on 12 May to discuss current </p><p>UNHCR activities.  Over the last week, UNHCR has held meetings </p><p>and conducted assessments in Arbil, As Sulaymaniyah, and Tamim </p><p>Governorates and plans to depart for Dohuk Governorate on 13 May. </p><p>In meetings with KRG officials in Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah, </p><p>UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq Coordinator reports that he is advocating </p><p>that the governments dissuade IDPs residing in their governorates </p><p>from returning to their home villages at this time.  UNHCR has </p><p>funds to support public information campaigns to explain that it </p><p>may be premature for IDPs to return home. </p><p> </p><p>15.  UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq Coordinator also stressed the </p><p>importance of helping those who have already returned and </p><p>recognized that returns will likely continue despite best efforts </p><p>to delay them.  UNHCR, using flash appeal funds, has the capacity </p><p>to provide emergency shelter and non-food items (NFIs), as well </p><p>as supplies to build permanent homes for those who have already </p><p>returned.  This includes those who recently returned to Makmour </p><p>in southern Arbil Governorate.  While much attention has been </p><p>placed on Makmour, UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq Coordinator noted that </p><p>returns have also occurred in the other northern governorates. </p><p>UNHCR/Iraq has requested 2,000 tents from their stockpiles in </p><p>Turkey to meet the needs of those returning.  More are available </p><p>if needed. </p><p> </p><p>16.  UNHCR explained that the IDP issue has been contentious </p><p>within the U.N.  However, UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq Coordinator </p><p>believes that, while UNHCR will not be formally tasked, they will </p><p>have de facto lead on return and reintegration issues for several </p><p>reasons.  UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq Coordinator noted that UNHCR has </p><p>prior experience working on protection and return issues, that </p><p>many of the issues related to return will be the same for </p><p>returning refugees and IDPs, and that many of the other U.N. </p><p>organizations are operationally restricted by the U.N. Security </p><p>Council Resolution (UNSCR) 986 umbrella. </p><p> </p><p>17.  There are three international UNHCR staff in Iraq.  UNHCR </p><p>hopes to increase its international staff and open five offices </p><p>in Duhok, Arbil, As Sulaymaniyah, Mosul, and Kirkuk.  UNHCR noted </p><p>that an updated reintegration plan and budget for Iraq would be </p><p>presented to donors in Geneva this week.  UNHCR recognizes that </p><p>their role in returns and reintegration will be largely dependent </p><p>on the decisions of occupying forces.  UNHCR\'s Northern Iraq </p><p>Coordinator noted that he had not yet met with anyone from OHRA. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
