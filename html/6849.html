<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001845 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR STATE FOR CA/VO/L/C FROM THE AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, JO (AL ALAMI NADIA A.) </p><p>SUBJECT: VISAS ADVISORY OPINIONS: SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA FOR </p><p>FSN NADIA AL ALAMI </p><p> </p><p>1.  I SUBMIT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION A NOMINATION FOR A </p><p>SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA (SIV) FOR SENIOR CULTURAL SPECIALIST </p><p>NADIA AL ALAMI AND HER FAMILY.  I CONCUR WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH </p><p>THE UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION FROM EMBASSY AMMAN\'S SIV PRE- </p><p>SCREENING PANEL THAT NADIA AL ALAMI DESERVES THIS STATUS IN </p><p>THAT SHE HAS FAITHFULLY SERVED THE USG IN AN OUTSTANDING </p><p>MANNER, ACHIEVING UNUSUAL PROMINENCE AND EXERCISING AN </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DEDICATION </p><p>TOWARDS USG OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  NADIA HAS ACHIEVED A HIGH LEVEL OF VISIBILITY IN HER </p><p>CAPACITY AS CULTURAL SPECIALIST, ONE OF THE MAIN CRITERIA </p><p>FOR THE SIV.  AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PRE-SCREENING PANEL </p><p>WITH LONG EXPERIENCE AT THIS POST CONFIRMED, SHE IS A WELL- </p><p>KNOWN AND RESPECTED INTERLOCUTOR TO THE JORDANIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  FROM MINISTERS TO UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS, OUR </p><p>TOP JORDANIAN CONTACTS KNOW AND ADMIRE NADIA\'S OUTSTANDING </p><p>CREATIVITY, ENERGY AND ORGANIZING ABILITY.  HER SUPERVISORS </p><p>REPORT THAT OVER THE YEARS SHE HAS OFTEN PERSUADED RELUCTANT </p><p>JORDANIAN OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE IN OR SANCTION KEY </p><p>MISSION PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREAS OF CIVIC </p><p>EDUCATION AND JUDICIAL REFORM.  SHE IS WITHOUT QUESTION ONE </p><p>OF THE BEST-KNOWN PRACTITIONERS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS IN </p><p>AMMAN, AMONG INFORMATION AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>ACADEMIA, NGO\'S AND OTHER KEY INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  OVER HER CAREER, NADIA HAS RISEN TO A POSITION OF </p><p>EXTENSIVE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MISSION\'S </p><p>CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, ANOTHER CRITERION FOR SIV.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SHE MANAGED ALL OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS SPEAKER, </p><p>CITIZEN EXCHANGE AND OTHER CULTURAL PROGRAMMING IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF ANY AMERICAN OFFICERS IN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p>SECTION DURING THE 1990-91 GULF WAR.  RECENTLY, SHE MANAGED </p><p>CULTURAL PROGRAMS IN THE ABSENCE OF A CULTURAL AFFAIRS </p><p>OFFICER FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST 2002.  IN THIS CAPACITY, </p><p>SHE NEGOTIATED MAJOR LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH JORDANIAN </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND AMERICAN NGOS FUNDED BY PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND </p><p>USAID FUNDS. SHE SHOWED A STRONG SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND </p><p>DEDICATION IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS, SAVING THE USG SIGNIFICANT </p><p>AMOUNTS OF MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN ADDITION TO CONSISTENTLY OUTSTANDING EVALUATIONS, </p><p>NADIA HAS ALSO EARNED SEVERAL MERITORIOUS HONOR AWARDS AND </p><p>THE RUNNER-UP POSITION TO THE USIS FSN OF THE YEAR. </p><p>HER APPLICATION IS EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED AND INCLUDES </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A FORMER AMBASSADOR, WHO CALLED NADIA A </p><p>"COURAGEOUS" FSN WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO DELIVER "TOUGH </p><p>MESSAGES" ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>5. NADIA HAS INDICATED A STRONG DESIRE TO IMMIGRATE TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO COMMENCE A NEW CAREER </p><p>THERE.  HER FAMILY WOULD ACCOMPANY HER: ADNAN ODEH (SPOUSE), </p><p>AUGUST 21, 1958, ZAID ODEH (SON), JANUARY 20, 1993, RAMI </p><p>ODEH (SON), AUGUST 25, 1997.  ALL ARE FROM JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO GRANT </p><p>MS. AL ALAMI AND HER FAMILY SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA STATUS. </p><p>NADIA AL ALAMI HAS MET ALL THE CRITERIA NECESSARY UNDER THE </p><p>REGULATIONS AND HAS MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION.  I EXPECT </p><p>THAT SHE AND HER FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE POSITIVE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NATION IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO LIVE </p><p>WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
