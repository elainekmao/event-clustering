<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004426 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/RA LAWSON, NEA/ARN ZIADEH, NEA/PD, OES/PCI SHIPPE </p><p>NEA POSTS FOR EST OFFICER AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEA REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT OFFICE HOSTS NGO GRANT-WRITING </p><p>WORKSHOP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The NEA Regional Environment Office sponsored a one-day </p><p>grant-writing workshop for the Jordanian environmental NGO </p><p>community on July 22.  The workshop trained 22 participants in </p><p>the concrete skills of writing proposals for improved fundraising </p><p>and NGO sustainability.  The Regional Environment Office summer </p><p>intern, Elissa Slotkin, developed, organized, and facilitated the </p><p>workshop. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The grant-writing workshop targeted representatives from </p><p>Jordanian environmental NGO\'s, most of whom had no formal </p><p>training in grant or proposal writing.  The goal of the workshop </p><p>was both to strengthen future proposals that the organizations </p><p>hope to submit under the OES Initiative and to other donors, and </p><p>to build the capacity of the NGO community in Jordan.  The </p><p>training focused on practical skill building, and participants </p><p>spent the majority of the day practicing the mechanics of grant- </p><p>writing in pairs.  The workshop also facilitated first-time </p><p>networking among participants and provided an opportunity for the </p><p>Regional Environment Office to show its commitment to Jordanian </p><p>civil society. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The grant-writing handbook, with samples and interactive </p><p>exercises, that our summer intern developed can be shared with </p><p>other posts wishing to conduct similar training.  Contact the NEA </p><p>Regional Environment Office, Paul Malik or Rana Safadi, via </p><p>unclassified Department email for copies of the materials. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
