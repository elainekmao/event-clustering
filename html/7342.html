<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, DS/OP/WHA, CA, INL, AND DRL </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, SNAR, KCRM, CASC, ASEC, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: GUNMEN SHOOT ADVANCE CAR OF HONDURAN FIRST LADY </p><p>AGUAS DE MADURO; GOH SAYS ATTEMPTED ROBBERY LIKELY REASON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  According to Honduran Minister of Public Security </p><p>Oscar Alvarez, an advance car for Honduran First Lady Aguas </p><p>Santas Ocana de Maduro was shot by unknown gunmen near the </p><p>town of Los Limones on the road from Olanchito to the </p><p>Caribbean coastal city of Trujillo in the Department of Yoro, </p><p>at approximately 11:30 a.m. Honduran time on April 10.  Note: </p><p> A separate GOH source gave the location as near the town of </p><p>Los Encuentros (near La Union) in the Department of Olancho. </p><p>End Note.  The driver of the advance car was wounded in the </p><p>leg by the gunfire; the other two occupants of the car were </p><p>apparently not injured.  No suspects have been caught.  The </p><p>GOH does not believe that the gunmen knew that the car was an </p><p>advance car for the First Lady, who was in Tegucigalpa at the </p><p>time of the incident. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Alvarez told the DCM that the car was advancing a </p><p>planned trip via helicopter by the First Lady to Trujillo. </p><p>He emphasized that the First Lady was never scheduled to </p><p>travel by car and that her helicopter flight had been </p><p>canceled due to bad weather.  The First Lady told ConGen that </p><p>she was ok, but shaken by the incident. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Whether it was on highway 41 in the Department of </p><p>Olancho, known as the "corridor of death," or highway 23 in </p><p>the Department of Yoro, both have been the scene of violent </p><p>robberies in the past in which gunmen have shot at cars and </p><p>buses to disable the vehicles or force the vehicles to stop. </p><p>Gunmen then have robbed the drivers/passengers of the </p><p>vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Post notes that President Ricardo Maduro has been in </p><p>Washington, DC since April 9 for the Central American </p><p>presidents meeting with the President to discuss CAFTA.  The </p><p>two have been married since October 2002.  The First Lady is </p><p>a Spaniard. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Given the fact that the First Lady never </p><p>intended to travel by car, Post has no reason to believe that </p><p>this was anything other than an attempted robbery, but </p><p>EmbOffs will follow-up with GOH contacts as the incident is </p><p>investigated further.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
