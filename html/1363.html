<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 005265 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/24/05 </p><p>TAGS: SADC, PREL, MARR, MCAP, ZU </p><p>SUBJECT: BREAKTHROUGH FOR SADC ON REFORMING POLITICAL </p><p>ORGAN? </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) GABORONE 2630, (B) PRETORIA 6497, (C) MBABANE </p><p>1670 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON CHIEF MICHAEL MORROW, REASON </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SADC FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS HAVE REACHED </p><p>CONSENSUS ON REFORMING THE LONG-MORIBUND SADC ORGAN ON </p><p>POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY, FM MERAFHE TOLD US.  THE </p><p>ORGAN HAS BEEN LARGELY DYSFUNCTIONAL SINCE ITS CREATION </p><p>IN 1996, DUE TO A DISPUTE OVER LINES OF AUTHORITY </p><p>BETWEEN IT AND SADC PROPER THAT PITTED ORGAN CHAIRMAN </p><p>ROBERT MUGABE AGAINST 1996-99 SADC CHAIRMAN NELSON </p><p>MANDELA.  ACCORDING TO MERAFHE, THE SADC FOREIGNQ </p><p>MINISTERS MET IN HARARE NOVEMBER 23 AND AGREED ON A </p><p>REFORM PLAN THAT CLEARLY SUBORDINATES THE ORGAN TO THE </p><p>SADC CHAIRMAN AND ESTABLISHES A TROIKA CHAIRMANSHIP OF </p><p>THE ORGAN.  THIS AGREEMENT WAS ACHIEVED ONLY AFTER </p><p>CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE WAS PUT ON ZIMBABWE, WHICH HAD </p><p>LONG OPPOSED THE REFORM PLAN, MERAFHE SAID.  SADC HEADS </p><p>OF STATE MUST NOW RATIFY THE PLAN, WHICH MERAFHE EXPECTS </p><p>TO HAPPEN AT AN EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT WITHIN THE NEXT SIX </p><p>MONTHS.  THIS REFORM, IF RATIFIED, WOULD BE A CLEAR STEP </p><p>FORWARD IN SADC\'S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A SOUND REGIONAL </p><p>SECURITY ARCHITECTURE.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGAN WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE </p><p>EXTENT TO WHICH SADC\'S DIVERSE MEMBERS CAN DEVELOP A </p><p>COMMON SET OF VALUES IN THEIR APPROACH TO CONFLICT </p><p>MANAGEMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>SADC MINISTERS AGREE TO REFORM POLITICAL/SECURITY ORGAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE TOLD AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOVEMBER 24 THAT AN IMPORTANT NEW DEVELOPMENT HAD </p><p>OCCURRED DURING HIS MEETING THE DAY BEFORE WITH A </p><p>GROUPING OF OTHER SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>(SADC) FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS IN HARARE.  THE </p><p>MINISTERS PRESENT (FROM AT LEAST 10 OF THE 14 MEMBER </p><p>STATES -- MAURITIUS, ZAMBIA, SEYCHELLES, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>DRC WERE NOT PRESENT) REACHED CONSENSUS ON A PLAN FOR </p><p>REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF SADC\'S ORGAN FOR POLITICS, </p><p>DEFENSE AND SECURITY.  THE PLAN FOLLOWED THE OUTLINE OF </p><p>THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY SADC FOREIGN AND DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTERS IN MBABANE IN OCTOBER 1999:  THAT THE ORGAN IS </p><p>INDEED A PART OF SADC AND SHOULD REPORT TO THE SADC </p><p>CHAIRMAN; AND THAT THE ORGAN\'S CHAIRMANSHIP (HELD BY </p><p>MUGABE SINCE THE ORGAN\'S CREATION IN 1996) SHOULD BE </p><p>TRANSFORMED INTO AN ANNUALLY ROTATING TROIKA.  (COMMENT: </p><p>ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD SIGNED ON TO THE MBABANE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE, BUT SUBSEQUENT BACKSLIDING THREW THE ORGAN </p><p>REFORM ISSUE INTO QUESTION.  SEE REFTELS.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  THE HARARE CONSENSUS, PROVIDED IT HOLDS, WOULD </p><p>OPEN THE DOOR TO CLEARING UP A PROBLEM THAT HAS </p><p>BEDEVILED SADC FOR FOUR YEARS.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE </p><p>ORGAN HAS HAD A DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SADC </p><p>ITSELF.  THE CRUX OF THE MATTER HAS BEEN SHARP </p><p>DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER THE ORGAN SHOULD BE </p><p>SUBORDINATE TO THE SADC CHAIRMAN OR AUTONOMOUS FROM IT. </p><p>THIS DISPUTE LARGELY PITTED ORGAN CHAIRMAN ROBERT MUGABE </p><p>AGAINST NELSON MANDELA, WHO HELD THE SADC CHAIRMANSHIP </p><p>FROM 1996-99.  THE MOST WELL KNOW CONTROVERSY </p><p>SURROUNDING THE ORGAN WAS THE UNRESOLVED DEBATE OVER </p><p>WHETHER THE ORGAN (OR FOR THAT MATTER, SADC ITSELF) EVER </p><p>FORMALLY ENDORSED THE DEPLOYMENT OF ZIMBABWEAN, NAMIBIAN </p><p>AND ANGOLAN TROOPS (THE SO-CALLED "SADC FORCES") TO THE </p><p>DRC IN AUGUST 1998. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>TWISTING HARARE\'S ARM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  MERAFHE SINGLED OUT ZIMBABWE AS THE MAIN </p><p>STUMBLING BLOCK AT THE HARARE MINISTERIAL.  HE SAID </p><p>ZIMBABWE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG WITH THE REFORM PLAN </p><p>UNTIL HE, ALONG WITH SOUTH AFRICAN FM ZUMA, "HAMMERED" </p><p>AWAY AT ZIMBABWEAN FM MUDENGE UNTIL "HE WAS DISABUSED OF </p><p>HIS NOTIONS."  MERAFHE (PROTECT) FURTHER NOTED THAT HE, </p><p>ALONG WITH THE OTHER MINISTERS WHO WERE PRESENT, ARE NOW </p><p>"QUIETLY CELEBRATING" ZIMBABWE\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE </p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  ACCORDING TO MERAFHE, THE SADC HEADS OF STATE </p><p>MUST NOW RATIFY THE PLAN BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERABLE.  HE </p><p>ANTICIPATES THIS WILL HAPPEN AT AN EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT </p><p>WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.  ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ABOUT THE CHANCES OF FURTHER BACKSLIDING AT THE HEAD OF </p><p>STATE LEVEL, MERAFHE REPLIED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY </p><p>DIFFICULT -- AND DOWNRIGHT EMBARRASSING -- FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p>OR ANY OTHER MEMBER STATE TO BREAK RANKS AT THIS POINT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>SADC CONSENSUS ON ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING, TOO? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  WE ASKED MERAFHE ABOUT THE "OTHER HALF" OF </p><p>SADC\'S RESTRUCTURING EFFORT -- A REVIEW THAT BEGAN 15 </p><p>MONTHS AGO OF SADC\'S HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED (AND WIDELY </p><p>CRITICIZED) SYSTEM OF 21 SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS, EACH </p><p>(WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS) FUNDED AND STAFFED BY A SINGLE </p><p>MEMBER STATE.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ISSUE WOULD BE </p><p>DISCUSSED BY THE SADC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS (OF WHICH </p><p>MERAFHE IS A MEMBER) AT THEIR NOVEMBER 28 MEETING IN </p><p>GABORONE, AND THAT HE EXPECTED A FAVORABLE AND NON- </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL OUTCOME.  (COMMENT:  THIS TRACKS WITH WHAT </p><p>WE ARE HEARING FROM A VARIETY OF OTHER SOURCES:  THAT </p><p>AFTER 15 MONTHS OF STUDY AND NEGOTIATIONS, SADC HAS </p><p>REACHED A CONSENSUS TO CONSOLIDATE THE 21 SECTOR UNITS </p><p>INTO 4 "CLUSTERS" -- TRADE/FINANCE/INVESTMENT; </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE; AGRICULTURE/ENVIRONMENT; AND HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES -- THAT WOULD BE REGIONALLY FUNDED AND </p><p>REGIONALLY STAFFED.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  SHOULD THE CONSENSUS REACHED IN HARARE STICK, </p><p>THIS CAN ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR </p><p>SADC.  HAVING A FUNCTIONING ORGAN WOULD GIVE SADC A </p><p>MUCH-NEEDED MECHANISM FOR ADDRESSING REGIONAL SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES, AS WELL AS GIVE THE U.S. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PARTNERS A POINT OF CONTACT THROUGH WHICH TO ENGAGE SADC </p><p>ON SUCH ISSUES.  AT THE SAME TIME, AT THIS POINT IT </p><p>WOULD NOT BE PRUDENT AUTOMATICALLY TO ASSUME SADC WILL </p><p>ACTUALLY APPROVE THESE REFORMS -- PRESIDENT MUGABE COULD </p><p>STILL BLOCK THEM IF HE SO CHOOSES.  NOR WOULD IT BE </p><p>PRUDENT TO OVERSELL THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A REFORMED </p><p>ORGAN.  MANY OBSERVERS POINT TO THE STARK DISPARITIES </p><p>AMONG THE 14 SADC COUNTRIES REGARDING THEIR LEVEL OF </p><p>POLITICAL MATURITY AND COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  UNLESS AND UNTIL THE REGION DEVELOPS A </p><p>GREATER DEGREE OF SHARED COMMITMENT TO THESE VALUES, THE </p><p>ULTIMATE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGAN AS A VEHICLE FOR </p><p>DIPLOMATIC, NON-MILITARY APPROACHES TO REGIONAL SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA WILL REMAIN IN QUESTION. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE HARARE CONSENSUS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR </p><p>SADC TO GET TO THAT POINT.  THIS, COUPLED WITH THE </p><p>ENCOURAGING NEWS SUGGESTING AGREEMENT ON CONSOLIDATING </p><p>SADC\'S FAR-FLUNG AND GENERALLY WEAK DEVELOPMENTAL </p><p>STRUCTURES, APPEARS TO BODE WELL FOR SADC\'S LONG-TERM </p><p>ASPIRATIONS TO BECOME A STRONGER ENGINE FOR REGIONAL </p><p>INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
