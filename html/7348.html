<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000641 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA, DSERCC AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X1, X6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AEMR, PTER, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBO EAC MEETING APRIL 11, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: Colombo 00623 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security Officer, </p><p>reason 1.5(C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) On April 11, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>  Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. </p><p>  The DCM chaired the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) The EAC agreed that Colombo appears calm; the </p><p>  trend of decreasing agitation continues.  We expect some </p><p>  protests throughout the country and in Colombo today after </p><p>  Friday prayers, but continue to expect these will be small </p><p>  and well controlled by the Sri Lanka Police.  This weekend </p><p>  marks the beginning of a holiday week in Sri Lanka that </p><p>  includes the Singhalese and Tamil New Year\'s celebrations </p><p>  and Easter. We expect virtually all Sri Lankans to be </p><p>  focused on these events rather than events in Iraq and </p><p>  elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) The EAC decided to disband the use of the LAV </p><p>  shuttle effective COB Friday April 11 unless the security </p><p>  situation degrades.  The Embassy will be closed Monday April </p><p>  14 for a local holiday.  The EAC will convene again and </p><p>  reassess the security situation Tuesday April 15. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) The local police will remain deployed at all the </p><p>  residences for one more week. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) Previous in-country travel restrictions remain in </p><p>  effect. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (S) RSO reminded EAC members of our walk-in procedures </p><p>  and that if any person claiming knowledge of any threat </p><p>  information approaches any employee, Post 1 and/or RSO must </p><p>  be contacted immediately. (RSO and DCM will meet with the </p><p>  Subject of reftel on Saturday April 12.  Following initial </p><p>  assessment, RSO will arrange for follow-up meetings and </p><p>  interviews, if appropriate.) </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
