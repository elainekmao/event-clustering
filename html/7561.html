(SBU) As per instructions REF, econoff delivered letter </p><p>to Dr. Muwaffak Haddadin, Director General, Arab Company for </p><p>Drug Industries and Medical Appliances (ACDIMA), on April 16. </p><p> The letter, a copy of which was provided to post by OFAC, </p><p>informed Haddadin that his request for a license to unblock </p><p>$4.5 million frozen in an account of Iraq-based Rafidain Bank </p><p>at the Bank of New York had been denied. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) After reading the letter, Haddadin said he </p><p>"expected" the response.  He explained that the sum in </p><p>question represented installments and interest on an </p><p>outstanding loan due to ACDIMA from Iraq-based Arab Company </p><p>for Antibiotics Industries (ACAI).  He said ACDIMA loaned $9 </p><p>million to the Iraqi company, in which it has a 36% stake, in </p><p>1995 for infrastructure improvements and equipment purchases. </p><p> ACAI had not made a payment on the loan since 2001, Haddadin </p><p>said, and the funds have since been blocked pursuant to U.S. </p><p>sanctions regulations regarding Iraq.  He said that although </p><p>the action was not a surprise, he was unclear as to what </p><p>options might be available to ACDIMA at present or what </p><p>options the company might have once sanctions are lifted. </p><p>Haddadim added that he was unsure as to whether or not the </p><p>Iraqi company was even functioning at this point. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ACDIMA is jointly owned by 15 Arab governments. </p><p>The largest shareholders are the governments of Iraq and </p><p>Saudi Arabia, each with a 17% stake.  Headquartered in Amman, </p><p>the company has offices and factories in Iraq, the UAE, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Tunisia, Syria, and Jordan.  The company is a </p><p>producer of pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicines, and dental </p><p>materials, and is an importer of medical equipment and </p><p>supplies. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Haddadin requested Embassy assistance in working </p><p>with the Department of Treasury to provide further </p><p>information to ACDIMA regarding possible next steps.  We </p><p>would appreciate OFAC\'s advice regarding this request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
