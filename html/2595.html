THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)/NATIONAL AIDS STANDING BUREAU, </p><p>IN COLLABORATION WITH AND SUPPORT FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00553  110920Z </p><p>CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC)/EMBASSY HANOI, HAS LAUNCHED </p><p>ITS NATIONAL PROGRAM TO COMBAT THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC WITH A TWO- </p><p>DAY WORKING MEETING OF KEY PROVINCIAL LEADERS FROM 40 PROVINCES </p><p>ACROSS VIETNAM. ONE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN HANOI, MARCH 6TH AND </p><p>7TH, FOR LEADERS FROM THE NORTHERN PROVINCES, AND A SECOND WILL </p><p>OCCUR IN HO CHI MINH CITY, MARCH 13TH AND 14TH, FOR LEADERS FROM </p><p>THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE MEETINGS ARE DESIGNED TO ORIENT PROVINCIAL LEADERS ON THE </p><p>MOH AND CDC COLLABORATION, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING </p><p>HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF HIGH-RISK </p><p>POPULATIONS, SUCH AS INJECTION DRUG USERS (IDU) AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>SEX WORKERS (CSW). DISCUSSIONS FOCUS ON INTEGRATED VOLUNTARY </p><p>HIV COUNSELING AND TESTING (VCT), PEER EDUCATION, AND EARLY HIV </p><p>INTERVENTION, CARE AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES.  AMONG MANY ISSUES </p><p>DISCUSSED IS THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING HIV TESTING SO THAT HIV- </p><p>INFECTED PERSONS LEARN THEIR STATUS EARLY.  PROVIDING ANONYMOUS </p><p>COUNSELING AND TESTING IS ONE MECHANISM FOR EARLY HIV DIAGNOSIS </p><p>AND TREATMENT.  THE TWO-DAY MEETINGS ALSO PROVIDE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT PROJECT MANAGEMENT MECHANISMS AND </p><p>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN OCTOBER 2001, THE USG, THROUGH EMBASSY HANOI, SIGNED A </p><p>COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE MOH ESTABLISHING A FIVE-YEAR, $10 </p><p>MILLION PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND VIETNAM\'S HIV PREVENTION </p><p>AND CARE PROGRAM.  VIETNAM IS ONE OF 24 COUNTRIES SUPPORTED BY </p><p>THE USG\'S GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO CURB THE FURTHER SPREAD OF HIV </p><p>DISEASE THROUGH FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT (GLOBAL AIDS </p><p>PROGRAM [GAP]). PROGRAM AREAS SUPPORTED UNDER GAP IN VIETNAM </p><p>INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF VCT AND PEER EDUCATION </p><p>PROGRAMS, EARLY HIV CLINICAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00553  110920Z </p><p>TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH- </p><p>RELATED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, CDC WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE </p><p>VIETNAM GAP-LIFE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (MOH\'S OPERATIONAL ARM FOR </p><p>THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT) IN CONDUCTING PROVINCIAL SITUATIONAL </p><p>AND NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, DEVELOPING INTEGRATED VCT SYSTEMS IN </p><p>THE 40 PROVINCES WITH THE HIGHEST HIV PREVALENCE, EXPANDING AND </p><p>STRENGTHENING HIV/STD/TB SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, AND PROVIDING </p><p>TRAINING TO STRENGTHEN THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF HEALTH </p><p>PROFESSIONALS FOR BETTER CARE AND SUPPORT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH </p><p>HIV OR THOSE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR CONTACTING THE DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p>5.   COMMENT:  HIV/AIDS IN VIETNAM HAS RAPIDLY INCREASED OVER THE </p><p>LAST 10 YEARS.  ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY HIV IN VIETNAM IS STILL </p><p>LARGELY IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS INCLUDING IDU AND CSW AND REMAINS LOW </p><p>IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, THE EXPLOSIVE EPIDEMICS IN THAILAND </p><p>AND CAMBODIA PRESENT A THREAT TO THE LOW NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  CDC\'S GLOBAL AIDS PROGRAM IS ONE THE LARGEST OF SEVERAL </p><p>USG PROGRAMS WORKING COOPERATIVELY IN VIETNAM TO HELP PREVENT THE </p><p>EPIDEMIC IN VIETNAM FROM BECOMING LIKE THAT OF THAILAND OR </p><p>CAMBODIA.  THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) </p><p>AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ARE ALSO SUPPORTING HIV PREVENTION </p><p>PROGRAMS IN VIETNAM, WORKING WITH INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL NGO\'S </p><p>AND VIETNAM\'S MINISTRIES OF HEALTH AND LABOR IN DEVELOPING HIV </p><p>INTERVENTIONS TARGETING HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS AND PROGRAMS AIMED </p><p>AT REDUCING STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00553  110920Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
