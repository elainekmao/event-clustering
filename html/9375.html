<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004422 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALL ON CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson. Reason: </p><p>1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a July 14 farewell call, Ambassador praised </p><p>Central Bank Governor Serdengecti for his economic policy </p><p>work and his cooperation with the U.S., and solicited </p><p>Serdengecti\'s views on the issues on which the new Ambassador </p><p> might want to focus.  Serdengecti responded that the most </p><p>important thing the United States could do was to implement a </p><p>strong public relations program to counter its poor image in </p><p>Turkey and the region.  He noted that, despite all the good </p><p>things the U.S. had done to help Muslims and to help Turkey </p><p>(he noted support for economic reform and EU accession), most </p><p>people still do not see the U.S. in a positive light. </p><p>Serdengecti said he was seeing mixed reports on whether </p><p>bilateral relations were improving.  To some extent, a </p><p>nationalist tone in the Turkish press is to be expected; </p><p>however, he fears that some in Turkey are portraying the U.S. </p><p>and the IMF as "no good" to further their aims of keeping </p><p>Turkey isolated and "third world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Serdengecti sees both good and bad economic trends. </p><p> On the positive side, inflation -- which had not fallen </p><p>significantly since December -- has begun to decline again. </p><p>He predicted the lira\'s strength and falling agricultural </p><p>prices, combined with the base year effect (i.e. high </p><p>inflation in the second half of 2002), would enable Turkey to </p><p>keep CPI below 25 percent and probably close to 20 percent </p><p>this year, assuming no sharp decline in the lira.  Although </p><p>domestic demand is growing moderately -- hence little risk of </p><p>economic overheating -- growth overall is "beyond </p><p>expecations."  The fact that growth has yet to generate many </p><p>jobs means productivity is increasing, which is healthy. </p><p>Over time, growth will increase support for the reform </p><p>program.  For the moment, the current account deficit is not </p><p>a cause for alarm, though the Bank is keeping a close eye to </p><p>see if imports of consumer goods (now at 11 percent of </p><p>imports) rise to levels indicating domestic demand is </p><p>becoming excessive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The main negative, per Serdengecti, is that the </p><p>government is not doing what it needs to do in terms of </p><p>reforms and meeting IMF conditions.  This failure is keeping </p><p>interest rates high (above 50 percent), and sooner or later </p><p>will be reflected in the exchange rate.  Serdengecti said </p><p>State Minister Babacan knows the situation better than </p><p>others, and tells the truth in internal meetings (though he </p><p>refrains from issuing public warnings); the bigger problem is </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan, who "lacks understanding" of the </p><p>economic situation.  Serdengecti said he is not sure if the </p><p>Prime Minister gets it.  After he and the PM last met, the PM </p><p>changed his rhetoric and started sounding like a Central Bank </p><p>governor.  However, the technocrats see him only </p><p>occasionally, and others who are close to him regularly give </p><p>him bad information and advice.  As a result, the Governor </p><p>expects the GOT to continue to move slowly on reforms until </p><p>the markets react. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Looking back on the past three years, Serdengecti </p><p>pointed to two major economic achievements:  growth, which </p><p>has brought GNP back to pre-crisis levels; and an economy </p><p>that is more resilient in the face of shocks, the result of </p><p>the shift to a floating exchange rate and numerous structural </p><p>reforms.  Inflation has come down some, but Serdengecti will </p><p>not feel comfortable until it falls below 20 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)   Serdengecti dismissed the notion -- bandied about </p><p>during PM Erdogan\'s recent trip to Malaysia -- that the </p><p>government would abandon the IMF approach.  The main </p><p>characteristic of this government, he argued, is that it </p><p>loves "bright ideas" -- jumping on alternative solutions as </p><p>if no one had ever considered them before.  One day the </p><p>solution is the Malaysian approach, and the next day it is </p><p>Islamic money coming from the Gulf.  The government, he </p><p>continued, explores these alternatives until they learn -- </p><p>usually from the press or the bureaucracy -- that they are </p><p>infeasible.  It is, he said, a time-wasting and costly </p><p>approach. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
