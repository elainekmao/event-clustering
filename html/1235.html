(C) SUMMARY: IN A MEETING ON JULY 28 THE IMF </p><p>RESREP, ROBERT FRANCO, PROVIDED ECONOFF WITH </p><p>INFORMATION ON UPCOMING IMF ACTIONS ON ZIMBABWE. </p><p>FRANCO ALSO SHARED HIS BLEAK OUTLOOK ON THE CURRENT </p><p>STATE OF THE ECONOMY.  FOREMOST ON HIS LIST OF </p><p>CONCERNS WAS: THE GOZ\'S VERY POOR BUDGET PERFORMANCE; </p><p>THREATS TO THE VIABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>AND MINING SECTORS (WHICH TOGETHER BRING IN MORE THAN </p><p>HALF OF ZIMBABWE\'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS); AND </p><p>THE ONGOING HEAD-IN-THE-SAND ATTITUDE OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>SENIOR LEADERSHIP.  THE IMF OFFICIAL BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THINGS WILL GET WORSE ECONOMICALLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR </p><p>OR TWO, BEFORE THE BOTTOM IS REACHED AND A TURNAROUND </p><p>SLOWLY ACHIEVED.  WHILE FRANCO FERVENTLY HOPES THAT </p><p>THE HIGHLY RESPECTED NEW MINISTERS OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>FINANCE (RESPECTIVELY NKOSONA MOYO AND SIMBA MAKONI) </p><p>WILL BE GIVEN AUTONOMY AND CLOUT TO EFFECT POSITIVE </p><p>CHANGE AND INTRODUCE RATIONAL POLICIES, HE IS NOT </p><p>OPTIMISTIC THAT THE PRESIDENT OR POLITBURO WILL </p><p>BESTOW SUCH POWERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE IMF\'S NEAR TERM SCHEDULE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04207  01 OF 03  311108Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FRANCO TOLD US THAT THE IMF\'S DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR, STANLEY FISHER, IS CURRENTLY TRAVELING IN </p><p>AFRICA (HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS NOT "OFFICIAL </p><p>TRAVEL") AND WOULD BE IN VICTORIA FALLS DURING THE </p><p>WEEK OF JULY 31.  CAPITALIZING ON THIS OPPORTUNITY, </p><p>THE IMF RESREP HAD SET UP A LUNCH MEETING TO </p><p>INTRODUCE THE NEW FINANCE MINISTER, SIMBA MAKONI, TO </p><p>FISHER.  FRANCO OPINED THAT THE MESSAGE THE FUND\'S </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOULD DELIVER TO MAKONI WOULD BE THE </p><p>SAME AS THAT RELAYED BY FUND MANAGING DIRECTOR </p><p>KOEHLER A FEW WEEKS AGO IN MOZAMBIQUE TO THE PREVIOUS </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER, HERBERT MURERWA.  THE MESSAGE </p><p>DELIVERED IN MAPUTO WAS THAT THE FUND IS WILLING TO </p><p>WORK WITH ZIMBABWE, BUT THAT MINIMUM CONDITIONS MUST </p><p>BE ADHERED TO AND COMMITMENT AND PROGRESS ON TARGETS </p><p>AND POLICIES MUST BE DEMONSTRATED BEFORE A PROGRAM IS </p><p>AGREED UPON AND MONIES BEGIN TO FLOW.  DIALOGUE AND </p><p>PROMISES NEEDED TO BE BACKED UP BY ACTION AND </p><p>DEMONSTRABLE RESULTS.  FRANCO BELIEVES THAT SUCH A </p><p>HURDLE WILL PROVE TOO DIFFICULT FOR ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>OVERCOME UNDER THE CURRENT ZANU-PF LED REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  FRANCO ALSO INFORMED ECONOFF THAT A SIX MEMBER </p><p>ARTICLE IV REVIEW TEAM, HEADED BY MR. NEUHAUS, WOULD </p><p>ARRIVE AUGUST 24.  HE REPEATED THAT, CONTRARY TO </p><p>LOCAL PRESS REPORTS, THE TEAM WAS NOT COMING TO </p><p>DISCUSS A NEW CREDIT OR THE RESUMPTION OF LENDING. </p><p>AS HE HAD TOLD US EARLIER IN THE YEAR (REF B), HE </p><p>FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT A SHADOW PROGRAM OF AT LEAST SIX </p><p>MONTHS WOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE A NEW CREDIT COULD BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04207  01 OF 03  311108Z </p><p>NEGOTIATED OR PUT FORTH FOR BOARD APPROVAL.  THE </p><p>VISITING TEAM WOULD RESTRICT ITSELF TO EXAMINING </p><p>ECONOMIC RESULTS FOR THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF THE </p><p>YEAR, ADDING THAT THEY WERE IN FOR A SHOCK WHEN THEY </p><p>SEE HOW BAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>BUDGET ARE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TURNING TO ECONOMICS, THE RESREP AND ECONOFF </p><p>COMPARED NOTES ON ZIMBABWE, AND FOUND LITTLE TO </p><p>DIFFER ON IN OUR DATA AND ASSESSMENTS.  BASED ON </p><p>CUMULATIVE FIGURES THROUGH END-MAY, THE BUDGET </p><p>DEFICIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AT ABOUT 16 PERCENT AND </p><p>IS FORECAST TO TOP 20 PERCENT BY YEAR-END.  (IN APRIL </p><p>THE EMBASSY PREDICTED IN REF C THAT THE DEFICIT WOULD </p><p>EASILY HIT 18-20 PERCENT.)  THE FORECAST MEANS THAT </p><p>THE GOZ WILL HAVE TO FINANCE A 2000 BUDGET DEFICIT OF </p><p>CLOSE TO ZIM $70 BILLION (OR ABOUT U.S. $1.85 BILLION </p><p>AT THE OFFICIAL RATE OF Z$38), AN ASTRONOMICAL </p><p>FIGURE.  (ZIMBABWE\'S 1999 GDP IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT </p><p>U.S. $5.6 BILLION.)

FOUR YEARS AGO THE </p><p>STOCK OF TREASURY BILLS WAS ZIM $13 BILLION.  THE T- </p><p>BILL FINANCING WILL FURTHER CROWD OUT INVESTMENT BY </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR, ADD TO INTEREST RATE PRESSURE, </p><p>AND RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST PAYMENTS.  THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S BUDGET DEFICIT IS ALSO BEING FINANCED BY USE </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT OVERDRAFT AT THE RESERVE BANK, </p><p>WHICH AT JUNE 23 WAS ZIM $10.6 BILLION COMPARED TO </p><p>$3.5 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 1999.  THE CURRENT OVERDRAFT </p><p>INTEREST RATE IS 70 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RESERVE MONEY IS GROWING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF </p><p>68.5 PERCENT (A ROUGH GUIDE TO FUTURE INFLATION), AND </p><p>INFLATION MEASURED BY CHANGES IN THE CONSUMER PRICE </p><p>INDEX IS 58.7 PERCENT (MAY 1999/MAY 2000).  USABLE </p><p>RESERVES OF THE CENTRAL BANK ARE CURRENTLY EQUAL TO </p><p>JUST A FEW DAYS OF IMPORTS, AND THE STOCK OF EXTERNAL </p><p>ARREARS ON JUNE 23 WAS U.S. $114.4 MILLION, OF WHICH </p><p>$37 MILLION IS GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED DEBT.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THERE ARE PRIVATE SECTOR ARREARS OF AT </p><p>LEAST U.S. $225 MILLION, INCLUDING $75 MILLION OF </p><p>SUPPLIERS\' CREDITS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WITH REGARD TO THE REAL SECTOR, INVESTMENT, </p><p>BOTH DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL, HAS COME TO A STANDSTILL. </p><p>IN 1999 REAL GDP GROWTH WAS NEGATIVE TO THE TUNE OF </p><p>ABOUT ONE PERCENT.  IN 2000 THE DECLINE IS FORECAST </p><p>AT BETWEEN 5 AND 10 PERCENT; ON A PER CAPITA BASIS, </p><p>THE DECLINE IS ABOUT 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04207  02 OF 03  311108Z </p><p>THE PEGGING OF THE ZIMBABWE DOLLAR SINCE JANUARY 1999 </p><p>AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF U.S. $1 EQUALS ZIM </p><p>$38 HAS SEVERELY DISTORTED FINANCIAL MARKETS AND </p><p>FUNDS FLOWS, AND ALONG WITH DECLINING EXPORTS HAS </p><p>CAUSED THE HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE.  THE OFFICIAL RATE </p><p>POSES A LIFE-THREAT TO THE VIABILITY OF EXPORTERS WHO </p><p>ARE FORCED TO REMIT SOME OR ALL OF THEIR PROCEEDS TO </p><p>THE RESERVE BANK AT THE DIRECTED RATE (GOLD PRODUCERS </p><p>100 PERCENT, SEE REF D, AND TOBACCO GROWERS, 25 </p><p>PERCENT).  FRANCO AGREED WITH ECONOFF\'S EVALUATION </p><p>THAT MOVEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW MINISTERS </p><p>ON THE EXCHANGE RATE ISSUE WILL BE THE FIRST ACID </p><p>TEST OF THE WILL AND ABILITY OF THE RULING PARTY TO </p><p>BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>ILLS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ARREARS TO THE IFI\'S </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AS OF JULY 28 ZIMBABWE\'S ARREARS TO THE WORLD </p><p>BANK STOOD AT U.S. $28 MILLION.  FRANCO HAS SEEN NO </p><p>REAL EFFORT TO DATE BY THE GOZ TO PAY THE ARREARS. </p><p>THE WORLD BANK RESREP "ONCE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC OF </p><p>FELLOWS" ACCORDING TO FRANCO, HAD HIMSELF BEGUN TO </p><p>LOSE HEART IN ZIMBABWE, TIRED OF CONSISTENTLY HAVING </p><p>PROMISES MADE TO HIM BROKEN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHILE ZIMBABWE HAS REMAINED CURRENT IN ITS </p><p>PAYMENTS TO THE IMF, HE BELIEVES THIS WILL SOON </p><p>CHANGE.  ON JULY 28 ZIMBABWE OWED THE FUND U.S. $6.5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04207  02 OF 03  311108Z </p><p>MILLION, AND THE RESERVE BANK GOVERNOR HAD TOLD HIM </p><p>THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO MAKE </p><p>THE PAYMENT ON SCHEDULE.  THE GOVERNOR PROMISED HIS </p><p>BEST EFFORTS TO MAKE THE PAYMENT THE WEEK OF JULY 31, </p><p>BUT COULD MAKE NO GUARANTEES.  FRANCO DESCRIBED THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AS "SUICIDAL." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE RESREP ALSO INFORMED US THAT EVEN IF THIS </p><p>RELATIVELY SMALL PAYMENT IS MADE, ZIMBABWE WILL FACE </p><p>A FUND PAYMENT OF U.S. $55 MILLION IN AUGUST.  FRANCO </p><p>JUST SHOOK HIS HEAD AT THIS PROSPECT, WRYLY OBSERVING </p><p>THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE ARTICLE IV AUDIT TEAM WILL </p><p>LIKELY COINCIDE WITH ZIMBABWE\'S DEFAULT ON ITS IMF </p><p>DEBT.  REVEALING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HIS NEXT AND </p><p>LIKELY FINAL ASSIGNMENT BEFORE RETIREMENT WILL BE </p><p>OUAGADOUGOU (FRANCO WILL BE OPENING A NEW FUND OFFICE </p><p>THERE BY YEAR END), THE 27 YEAR IMF-VETERAN COMMENTED </p><p>THAT EVEN THOUGH OUAGADOUGOU IS A ROUGH ASSIGNMENT, </p><p>CONDITIONS WILL PROBABLY BE BETTER THERE THAN WHAT </p><p>HARARE LOOKS SET TO BECOME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2251 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04207  03 OF 03  311108Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------745A16  311108Z /38 </p><p>P 311108Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6723 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR 4510 ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/07 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, IMF, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S IMF RESREP ON THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>AND THE ECONOMY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04207  03 OF 03  311108Z </p><p> </p><p>10.
