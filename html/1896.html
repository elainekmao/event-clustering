SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  INITIAL COURTESY CALLS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02499  01 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>ON COUNTERPARTS IN THE FRENCH AND BELGIAN EMBASSIES HAVE </p><p>REVEALED DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE EU RANKS OVER HOW TO </p><p>PROCEED ON ARTICLE 8 NEGOTIATIONS WITH ZIMBABWE.  THE </p><p>AUSTRALIANS SAY THAT THE GOZ HAS NOT YET INDICATED WHO </p><p>WILL BE ON THE ZIMBABWEAN DELEGATION TO THE CHOGM IN </p><p>BRISBANE.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF </p><p>THE GRAVITY OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS, EVERYONE AGREES </p><p>THAT THE ECONOMY IS A MAJOR DISASTER IN THE MAKING.  WE </p><p>WOULD APPRECIATE USEU VIEWS ON POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES </p><p>WITHINT THE EU ON ARTICLE 8 CONSULTATIONS ON ZIMBABWE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FRANCE: IT COULD BE WORSE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COUNSELOR OF THE FRENCH EMBASSY JEROME SAUTIER </p><p>WAS BY FAR THE MOST RELAXED ABOUT THE STATE OF PLAY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  HE NOTED THAT THE POLITICAL SITUATION HAD </p><p>GONE DOWNHILL SINCE HIS ARRIVAL TWO YEARS EARLIER BUT </p><p>SPECULATED THAT ZIMBABWE COULD STILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE </p><p>2002 ELECTIONS WITHOUT MAJOR DAMAGE.  HE OBSERVED THAT </p><p>ON THE AFRICAN CONTINUUM, ZIMBABWE RANKS SOMEWHERE IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>GREATER CONCERN FOR THE RAPID ECONOMIC DETERIORATION, </p><p>WHICH HE FEARED COULD BE IRREVERSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>BELGIUM: ESCHEWING THE HARD LINE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02499  01 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>3.  (C) BELGIAN COUNSELOR ALEXIS DE CROMBRUGGHE SAID </p><p>THAT HE (AND HIS ABSENT AMBASSADOR) HAD TRIED TO TAKE A </p><p>PRAGMATIC VIEW IN DEALING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS </p><p>"VERY TROUBLED COUNTRY."  HE SAID THAT HE WAS CONCERNED </p><p>THAT THE EU "ULTIMATUM" ON ARTICLE 8 CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE COULD BACKFIRE, WITH THE ZIMBABWEANS HARDENING </p><p>THEIR POSITION, AGGRAVATING AN ALREADY COMPLICATED </p><p>DYNAMIC.  HE CITED SEVERAL TECHNICAL MISSTEPS IN </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE "ULTIMATUM" AND NOTED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>CLEAR DIFFERENCES AMONG THE EU DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN </p><p>HARARE ON HOW BEST TO PROCEED.  DE CROMBRUGGHE </p><p>IDENTIFIED GOZ FLEXIBILITY ON EU ELECTION MONITORING AS </p><p>A KEY INDICATOR TO PROGRESS IN EU/ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DE CROMBRUGGHE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT FULLY SHARE </p><p>THE VIEWS OF SEVERAL EU CHIEFS OF MISSION THAT THE MDC </p><p>WILL SWEEP TO VICTORY IN FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  THE </p><p>OUTCOME OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND THE RECENT </p><p>ZANU-PF WINS IN BY-ELECTIONS, INDICATE THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>STILL ENJOYS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY IN ITS </p><p>TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLD OF MASHONALAND.  HE PREDICTED </p><p>THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE COULD BE A CLOSE ONE, PERHAPS </p><p>THE LEAST IDEAL OUTCOME UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>DCM NOTED THAT THE DECLINING ECONOMY WILL CERTAINLY </p><p>ERODE ZANU SUPPORT AND POINTED OUT "FREE AND FAIR" IS </p><p>THE OPERATIVE PHRASE.  CONTINUED ZANU-PF INTIMIDATION </p><p>COUPLED WITH CONCERTED ATTACKS ON JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS RISKS MUDDYING THE WATER TO THE DEGREE THAT </p><p>EVEN ELECTORAL VICTORIES IN LIKELY ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS </p><p>COULD BE CALLED INTO QUESTION.  DE CROMBRUGGHE FULLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02499  01 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>AGREED THAT THE TIDE OF THE ECONOMY IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>RUNNING AGAINST THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN A RELATED DEVELOPMENT, ON AUGUST 22 EU </p><p>DIPLOMAT ALEX KREMER TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF THAT </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS ON THE ARTICLE 8 DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE SINCE THE GENERAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL ISSUED </p><p>ITS ULTIMATUM IN LATE JUNE.  ACCORDING TO KREMER, THE </p><p>GAC WOULD NOT DECIDE ON NEXT STEPS -- INCLUDING A </p><p>POSSIBLE MOVE TO ARTICLE 96 DISCUSSIONS -- UNTIL ITS </p><p>NEXT GATHERING IN EARLY OCTOBER.  THAT SAID, THE EU </p><p>WORKING GROUP ON AFRICA PLANNED TO MEET IN EARLY </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE GAC </p><p>WOULD LIKELY ABIDE BY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>AUSTRALIA: MUGABE WELCOME TO COME </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE NUMBER-TWO FOR AUSTRALIA, DON FOLEY, AND </p><p>POLITICAL OFFICER JENNY DEE SAID THAT THE GOZ HAS NOT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO8710 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02499  02 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------15E2E8  240558Z /38 </p><p>P 240550Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9541 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p>LONDON FOR NEARY </p><p>USEU FOR POLCOUNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/24/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GLEANINGS FROM THE DIPLOMATIC HUSTINGS -- IT\'S </p><p>         THE ECONOMY, STUPID, AS MUCH AS THE POLITICS </p><p> </p><p>YET INDICATED WHO WILL BE ON OR HEAD THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DELEGATION TO THE CHOGM IN BRISBANE, ALTHOUGH FOLEY </p><p>ASSUMES MUGABE WILL GO.  FOLEY CITED SEVERAL RECENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02499  02 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>ARTICLES IN THE GOVERNMENT PRESS THAT CRITICIZED VARIOUS </p><p>"RACIST" AUSTRALIAN POLITICIANS FOR CALLING ON CANBERRA </p><p>TO BLOCK MUGABE\'S PARTICIPATION.  FOLEY SAID THAT IT IS </p><p>THE AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VIEW THAT MUGABE </p><p>SHOULD ATTEND IF HE SO CHOOSES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DEE SAID THAT POSSIBLE COMMONWEALTH ELECTION </p><p>MONITORING WAS "IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS" BUT DID NOT </p><p>EXPECT MUCH MOVEMENT ON THIS FRONT UNTIL AFTER THE </p><p>CHOGM.  SHE SAID THE EIGHT-MEMBER COMMONWEALTH GROUP HAD </p><p>THUS FAR BEEN UNABLE TO AGREE ON WHAT TOPICS TO DISCUSS </p><p>-- THE GOZ SEEKS TO LIMIT TALKS TO LAND REFORM -- LET </p><p>ALONE CONSIDER ELECTION MONITORING.  (NOTE:  IN A </p><p>SEPARATE MEETING WITH POLCHIEF, DEE AND BRITISH </p><p>POLITICAL OFFICER WERE NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>6 MEETING IN ABUJA OF THE EIGHT-MEMBER COMMONWEALTH </p><p>GROUP WOULD PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS.  LINDSAY </p><p>COMMENTED THE AFRICAN PARTICIPANTS IN ABUJA WOULD PLAY A </p><p>CRITICAL ROLE BUT EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT FM LAMIDO, WHO </p><p>HAD TAKEN A SOFTER VIEW OF MUGABE THAN HAS OBASANJO, </p><p>WOULD BE CHAIRING THE MEETING.)  DEE SAID THAT </p><p>PROJECTING WHERE THE POLITICAL SITUATION WILL LEAD (A </p><p>STAPLE OF DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES HERE) IS CRYSTAL BALL </p><p>GAZING, GIVEN THE VARIABLES.  HOWEVER, SHE AND FOLEY </p><p>EXPRESSED DISMAY AT THE EFFECT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN </p><p>ON THE AVERAGE ZIMBABWEAN. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02499  02 OF 02  240558Z </p><p>8.  IN OUR VIEW, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE BAD </p><p>POLITICAL DECISIONS FROM ECONOMIC DECLINE IN THE CURRENT </p><p>CONTEXT, WITH EACH FEEDING THE OTHER.  WE CANNOT SAY IF </p><p>DE CROMBRUGGHE\'S COMMENTS ON ARTICLE 8 REFLECT BELGIAN </p><p>THINKING BUT WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INSIGHTS USEU CAN </p><p>PROVIDE ON POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE EU ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
