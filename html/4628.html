<p>S E C R E T STATE 250963 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, EFINM, SY, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DESIGNATING HAMAS AND HEZBALLAH: APPROACHING EU </p><p>CAPITALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 65911 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY EUR PDAS CHARLES RIES, E.O. 12958 REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. FOR EU MEMBER CAPITALS: </p><p>THE POINTS AT PARAS TWO AND THREE ARE FOR DELIVERY PRIOR </p><p>TO THE EU FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING ON 12/9 AND 12/10. </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THE DANISH PRESIDENCY INTENDS TO FOLLOW UP </p><p>ON THIS WEEK\'S DISCUSSION OF FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AT THE COREPER AND COTER. POSTS MAY ALSO </p><p>WISH TO DRAW UPON THE POINTS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED IN </p><p>REFTELS (REF A IS AN ORAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY </p><p>FOCUSED ON CUTTING OFF HAMAS AND HIZBALLAH FUNDRAISING IN </p><p>EU STATES). FOR NORWAY: GIVEN NORWAY\'S ACTIVE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN PROMOTING MIDDLE EAST PEACE, WE ALSO WANT </p><p>TO INCLUDE NORWAY IN THIS DEMARCHE. POST IS WELCOME TO </p><p>TAILOR POINTS AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/REL EUMEM AND NORWAY) ACTION ADDRESSEES ARE </p><p>INSTRUCTED TO DRAW ON THE FOLLOWING TALKING POINTS IN </p><p>APPROACHING EU MEMBER CAPITALS AND OSLO.   THE POINTS AT </p><p>PARA THREE MAY BE LEFT AS A NON-PAPER.   BEGIN TALKING </p><p>POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LISTING OF SEVERAL TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE UPCOMING EU FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS\' MEETING. EU ACTION ON LISTING THESE GROUPS, </p><p>WHICH IS VITAL TO CURTAILING THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS </p><p>IN EUROPE, WILL ADVANCE OUR MUTUAL INTEREST IN COMBATING </p><p>TERRORISM AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE EU\'S ROLE IN PROMOTING </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE THROUGH THE QUARTET. </p><p> </p><p>-- SUCH ACTION WILL ALSO SERVE THE EU IN ITS BILATERAL </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE PALESTINIANS AND PARTICULARLY WITH </p><p>ISRAEL, BY REINFORCING EU CREDIBILITY AND DETERMINATION ON </p><p>THE TERRORISM ISSUE. IN 2001, THE EU ITSELF CALLED UPON </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY TO "DISMANTLE THE TERRORIST </p><p>NETWORKS OF HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD, ARREST ALL SUSPECTS, </p><p>AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE" IN IT THE EU\'S LAKEN </p><p>DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EVIDENCE WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORTS OUR VERY REAL </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR: HIZBALLAH AND HAMAS. AS SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>URGED EARLIER THIS YEAR, "(C)ITING LEGAL REASONS IN NOT </p><p>MOVING AGAINST (THESE) GROUPS IGNORES KEY MORAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES AND SENDS A DANGEROUS SIGNAL . . . . I </p><p>ASK THAT YOU LOOK FOR WAYS TO FREEZE ASSETS AND PREVENT </p><p>THESE GROUPS FROM RAISING FUNDS, INCLUDING THROUGH </p><p>CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS." WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER </p><p>THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY AS YOU EVALUATE THE LISTING OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (FTOS) AND </p><p>IN SHAPING YOUR BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES, SUCH </p><p>AS IRAN AND SYRIA, WHICH SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/REL EUMEM AND GON) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: </p><p> </p><p>HIZBALLAH </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS HIZBALLAH A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION, ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIONS. WHILE WE </p><p>DON\'T OPPOSE HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, </p><p> </p><p>IT IS NOT CREDIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A                       - </p><p>TERRORIST/OPERATIONAL WING OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND A </p><p>POLICY/POLITICAL WING.   TO TRY TO DO SO IS A WHOLELY </p><p>ARTIFICIAL EXERCISE AS HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP OF BOTH IS </p><p>ONE AND THE SAME. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NOVEMBER 29, 2002 STATEMENT OF HIZBALLAH SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH CALLING FOR PALESTINIANS TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE SUICIDE BOMBINGS WORLDWIDE UNDERLINES THE GLOBAL </p><p>REACH OF THIS ORGANIZATION, THE INSEPERABLE NATURE OF ITS </p><p>POLITICAL AND OPERATIONAL WINGS, AND THE DESTABILIZING </p><p>IMPACT IT HAS ON THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETERMINATION AND ABILITY </p><p>OF HIZBALLAH TO MOUNT TERRORIST OPERATIONS. THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES HAVE A DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST REGION AND UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH CONDITIONS WHEREBY MEANINGFUL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>CAN RESUME. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH CONTINUES TO RECEIVE WEAPONS FROM IRAN. WE </p><p>ARE CONCERNED THIS CONTINUED RE-SUPPLY INCREASES THE </p><p>LIKELIHOOD THAT HIZBALLAH WILL ACQUIRE LONGER-RANGE AND </p><p>MORE ADVANCED ROCKETS OR MISSILES. THE GROWING STOCKPILE </p><p>MAY LIKEWISE ENHANCE HIZBALLAH\'S PERCEPTION OF ITS </p><p>DETERRENT CAPACITY AND EMBOLDEN IT TO INCREASE BORDER </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FINANCIAL, TRAINING, AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT THAT </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND IRAN PROVIDE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS ALSO </p><p>GENERATES SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: </p><p> </p><p>- HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD (IRGC) </p><p>PERSONNEL HAVE CONDUCTED WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES TRAINING </p><p>FOR MEMBERS OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN THE BEKAA VALLEY AND </p><p>IN IRAN BEFORE SENDING THEM BACK INTO THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p>  - HIZBALLAH COORDINATED THE MARCH 12 ATTACK AT SHLOMI IN </p><p>  NORTHERN ISRAEL, IN WHICH SIX ISRAELIS WERE KILLED, </p><p>  INCLUDING FOUR CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>   - HIZBALLAH IS LIKEWISE WORKING TO INFILTRATE ITS OWN </p><p>   OPERATIVES INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO FACILITATE </p><p>   PALESTINIAN ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS. AN OPERATIVE (A </p><p>   SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN) ARRESTED IN HEBRON LAST SUMMER </p><p>   BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICE WAS TRAINED IN LEBANON </p><p>   AND SENT TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO ENHANCE </p><p>   PALESTINIAN BOMB PRODUCTION AND HELP PLAN ATTACKS. </p><p></p><p>   - HIZBALLAH COOPERATED WITH FATAH PALESTINIANS ON THE </p><p>   JANUARY 2002 KARINE A SHIPMENT. THE SHIP WAS CARRYING </p><p>   ROUGHLY 50 TONS OF MOSTLY IRANIAN-MADE WEAPONS - SUCH AS </p><p>   BATTLEFIELD ROCKETS, NUMEROUS LIGHT AND ANTI-TANK </p><p>   MISSILES, MORTARS, MINES, EXPLOSIVES, AND SMALL ARMS AND </p><p>   MUNITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>   - IN MAY 2001, THE PFLP-GC, WITH HIZBALLAH\'S ASSISTANCE, </p><p>   ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE 45 SEALED BARRELS OF ARMS BY SEA </p><p>   FROM LEBANON TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. PRESS </p><p>   REPORTS AT THE TIME OF SEIZURE STATED THAT INTERROGATION </p><p>   OF THE CREW SHOWED THE SAME SHIP HAD MADE THREE EARLIER </p><p>   DELIVERIES TO GAZA. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP HAS CALLED ON ARAB LEADERS TO </p><p>PROVIDE "SERIOUS" MONEY AND WEAPONS TO THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p>IN AN INTERVIEW IN MARCH WITH THE LONDON SUNDAY TIMES, THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY OF HIZBALLAH, HASSAN NASRALLAH, ALSO </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THREE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY </p><p>THE JORDANIANS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE A NUMBER OF </p><p>KATYUSHA ROCKETS TO PALESTINIAN FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EFFECT SUCH SUPPORT AND COORDINATION COULD HAVE ON </p><p>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL IS </p><p>CLEARLY WORRISOME. INCREASED IRANIAN FUNDING AND WEAPONS, </p><p>ALONG WITH TRAINING PROVIDED BY BOTH IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, </p><p>HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED LETHALITY OF THE CURRENT </p><p>INTIFADA. BY NASRALLAH\'S OWN ADMISSION, BROADCAST ON </p><p>BEIRUT TELEVISION NOVEMBER 26, HIZBALLAH IS "STRONGER </p><p>TODAY THAN IT WAS AT THE TIME" OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>ISRAELI TROOPS FROM LEBANON IN 2000. NASRALLAH HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY AND PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS </p><p> </p><p>-- WHILE SOME NATIONS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL </p><p>WING, INCLUDING ITS FUNDRAISING ARM AND ARRAY OF SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES, AND IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, ITS OPERATIONAL </p><p>BRANCH, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS </p><p>APPROPRIATE TO DO SO BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE </p><p>UNITED STATES VIEWS HAMAS AS A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION WITH </p><p>UNIFIED GOALS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE </p><p>STATE OF ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS POLITICAL LEADERS OPENLY LOBBY FOR THE </p><p>     "LIQUIDATION" OF ISRAEL THROUGH VIOLENCE, AS </p><p>     POLITICAL BUREAU CHIEF KHALID MISHA\'AL DID IN TEHRAN </p><p>     ON APRIL 24, 2001. HAMAS SPOKESMAN MOUSA ABU MARZOUK </p><p>     VOWED HAMAS WOULD "STEP UP ITS GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST </p><p>     ISRAEL" AND THIS SUMMER ADMITTED ON THE U.S. </p><p>     TELEVISION SHOW "60 MINUTES" THAT HAMAS WAS </p><p>     DEVELOPING, IN GAZA, ADVANCED ROCKETS TO STRIKE </p><p>     TARGETS INSIDE ISRAEL PROPER. DR. ABDEL RANTISI, </p><p>     ANOTHER PROMINENT HAMAS POLITICAL OFFICIAL, SAID </p><p>     SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE "THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR </p><p>     US." RANTISI PUBLICLY ADMITS THAT IZZ AL-DIN AL- </p><p>     QASSAM INITIATES ATTACKS BASED ON CUES HEARD IN </p><p>     PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY HAMAS POLITICAL FIGURES. </p><p> </p><p>     - IN A MAY 2002 STATEMENT POSTED ON A PROMINENT </p><p>     ARABIC INTERNET SITE, HAMAS MILITARY LEADER SALAH </p><p>     SHIHADA, SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED IN AN ISRAELI TARGETED </p><p>     OPERATION THIS FALL, SAID THAT HAMAS\' "POLITICAL </p><p>     APPARATUS IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE MILITARY APPARATUS, </p><p>     AND A DECISION OF THE POLITICAL [ECHELON] TAKES </p><p>     PRECEDENCE OVER THE DECISION OF THE MILITARY </p><p>     [ECHELON], WITHOUT INTERVENING IN MILITARY </p><p>     OPERATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>     - IN AUGUST 2002, HAMAS\' GAZA-BASED SPIRITUAL LEADER </p><p>     AHMAD YASIN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, "WHEN WE [HAMAS] </p><p>     MAKE DECISIONS ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND CONVEY THEM </p><p>     TO THE MILITARY WING, IT ABIDES BY IT NORMALLY." </p><p> </p><p>-- PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) LEADERS TELL US HAMAS </p><p>"POLITICAL" LEADERS ARE COMPLICATING THEIR EFFORTS TO </p><p>LIMIT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS.   IN JANUARY 2002, A </p><p>PROMINENT ARAB NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT PA LEADERS HAD </p><p>ASKED SYRIA-BASED HAMAS LEADERS IMAD AL-ALAMI, MARZUK AND </p><p>MISHA\'AL TO STOP "POURING OIL ON THE FIRE" BY ARMING AND </p><p>FUNDING CELLS IN THE WEST BANK. THE SAME NEWSPAPER </p><p>REPORTED IN JUNE 2002 THAT AL-ALAMI HAD MET WITH </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, HIZBALLAH AND AL-QAEDA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS CONDUCTING "MAJOR MARTYRDOM </p><p>OPERATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS\' NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORTS THE </p><p>VIOLENT POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, BOTH </p><p>FINANCIALLY AND THROUGH EFFORTS FURTHERING INDOCTRINATION. </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS IS SUSPECTED OF DERIVING A LARGE PERCENTAGE </p><p>     OF ITS REVENUE FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE GULF </p><p>     REGION, THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE. THESE </p><p>     FINANCES UNDERMINE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BY </p><p>     PROMOTING HAMAS\' PROPAGANDA AND FACILITATING THE </p><p>     RECRUITMENT AND INDOCTRINATION OF HAMAS ACTIVISTS. </p><p>     SOME OF THESE FUNDS MAY ALSO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF </p><p>     "MARTYRS" AND THE EXECUTION OF TERRORIST OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS CENTERS ITS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY IN THE </p><p>IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. THERE IT </p><p>OPENLY MAINTAINS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>SERVICES, RAISES MONEY, ORGANIZES ACTIVITIES, DISTRIBUTES </p><p>PROPAGANDA AND RECRUITS MEMBERS. SOME RECRUITS ARE </p><p>CLANDESTINELY TRAINED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS FOR SERVICE </p><p>WITHIN IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST WING. </p><p>HAMAS\' STRONG INFLUENCE IN MANY PALESTINIAN MOSQUES, </p><p>SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CLUBS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO INDOCTRINATE THE PALESTINIAN CONSTITUENCY WITH </p><p>ITS VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ITS YOUTH, AND PROVIDES </p><p>RELIGIOUS SANCTION TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS. </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS "POLITICAL" LEADER MISHA\'AL ON NOVEMBER 16, </p><p>     2000 WAS QUOTED IN THE ARAB DAILY AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </p><p>     AS SAYING, "HAMAS IS A JIHAD MOVEMENT THAT SERVES THE </p><p>     PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE CURRENT INTIFADA. </p><p>     EVERYTHING HAMAS OWNS IS USED IN THIS BATTLE." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS POSES AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHICH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>VIEWS AS CRITICAL TO ITS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY, </p><p>AND/OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, THROUGH THE INCITEMENT OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND OVERT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES: </p><p> </p><p>     - THE UNITED STATES HAS INFORMATION INDICATING THAT </p><p>     HAMAS\' POLITICAL BUREAU OFTEN HAS FOREKNOWLEDGE OF, </p><p>     IS LINKED TO, AND/OR PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR THE </p><p>     OPERATIONS OF IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM AGAINST ISRAELI </p><p>     TARGETS.   MOST RECENTLY, HAMAS CLAIMED </p><p>     RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JULY 2002 BOMBING AT </p><p>     JERUSALEM\'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY THAT KILLED FOUR </p><p>     ISRAELIS AND FIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE MARCH </p><p>     2002 SUICIDE BOMBINGS THAT KILLED 25 ISRAELIS ON </p><p>     PASSOVER NIGHT IN NETANYA, ISRAEL, AND 15 ISRAELIS AT </p><p>     A HAIFA CAFE THE SAME WEEK. SIMILARLY DEVASTATING </p><p>     ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2001, SUCH AS THE JUNE 1 </p><p>     BOMBING OF A TEL AVIV NIGHTCLUB THAT KILLED 22 </p><p>     ISRAELI TEENAGERS, AND THE AUGUST 9 SUICIDE ATTACK ON </p><p>     A JERUSALEM PIZZERIA IN WHICH 15 CIVILIANS DIED. </p><p>     AMERICAN CITIZENS AND OTHER NON-ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN </p><p>     KILLED AND INJURED IN THESE AND OTHER ATTACKS. HAMAS </p><p>     SPOKESMEN, INCLUDING PURPORTED "POLITICAL" LEADERS, </p><p>     CATEGORIZE THESE OPERATIONS AS "SELF-DEFENSE" - PART </p><p>     OF ITS DECLARED POLICY TO CREATE A "BALANCE OF </p><p>     TERROR" WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS IS ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND ITS </p><p>AFFILIATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN </p><p>INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND: </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. FOR </p><p>     PURPOSES OF TRAINING, FUND-RAISING AND CONSULTING </p><p>     WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND OTHER TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p>     ORGANIZATIONS, HAMAS IS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE A </p><p>     PRESENCE IN IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>     SUDAN, YEMEN AND SYRIA (IT MAINTAINS ITS HEADQUARTERS </p><p>     IN DAMASCUS). FOUR OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE LISTED BY </p><p>     THE USG AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.   HAMAS IS </p><p>     ALSO ACTIVE IN OTHER NATIONS.   FURTHER, HAMAS MAY </p><p>     ASPIRE TO DESTABILIZE THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IN </p><p>     THE EVENT OF ARAFAT\'S DEATH. </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS IS BELIEVED TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER FOREIGN </p><p>     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OF GLOBAL REACH, INCLUDING </p><p>     HIZBALLAH. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HAMAS AND </p><p>     HIZBALLAH HAVE COOPERATED ON WEAPONS ENHANCEMENT AND </p><p>     DEVELOPMENT FOR USE WITHIN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>     TERRITORIES. HAMAS IS ALSO KNOWN TO MAINTAIN CLOSE </p><p>     TIES WITH IRAN. HAMAS\' AFFILIATION WITH THESE </p><p>     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH ARE TOGETHER </p><p>     RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN </p><p>     CITIZENS, AND IRAN (A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM) </p><p>     CONSTITUTES A GROWING THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN </p><p>     INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
