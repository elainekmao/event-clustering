<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 002542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR DEP.SECRETARY\'S OFFICE AND FINCEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROLS IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ABUJA 2521 B) STATE 170551 </p><p>     B. C) ABUJA 2416 D) ABUJA 2118 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) The following assessment of Nigeria,s money laundering </p><p>control regime is provided for Washington end-users as a </p><p>reference guide and draws on recent Emboffs, discussions </p><p>with various GON law enforcement and Central Bank officials </p><p>responsible for money laundering and banking controls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Landscape </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) There is no reliable estimate of the amount of </p><p>criminal money laundered in or through Nigeria.  Canvassing </p><p>of senior GON law enforcement and Central Bank officials has </p><p>produced general agreement that non-drug criminal proceeds </p><p>account for at least half of Nigeria,s money laundering </p><p>program, if not more.  All agree that no one source of </p><p>criminal activity can match the strength of the drug trade, </p><p>but all agree that these sources are many and include: public </p><p>corruption, "419" advance-fee fraud, trafficking in women and </p><p>children, and the illegal arms trade.  This conclusion seems </p><p>sound given the apparent magnitude of the proceeds of </p><p>corruption alone, including the billions reportedly stolen </p><p>from public coffers under military rule.  Only some in </p><p>Nigeria,s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) </p><p>insist that drug proceeds account for the bulk of money </p><p>laundering here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Legal Structure </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Nigeria,s legal tool for dealing with money </p><p>laundering lies solely within a 1995 decree signed into force </p><p>by former military dictator Sani Abacha.  No law preceded it </p><p>and there has been no new legislation to date (though some </p><p>revisions are planned, as reported below).  This law sought </p><p>to bring Nigeria into conformity with the 1988 UN Convention </p><p>on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances (aka the Vienna Drug </p><p>Convention) by outlawing drug money laundering.  In that </p><p>regard, the law seems to address adequately the laundering of </p><p>all proceeds from drug trafficking.  Both the NDLEA and the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are identified as the competent </p><p>authorities charged with monitoring individuals, bank </p><p>deposits in excess of 500,000 naira (equivalent to USD 4,460) </p><p>or corporate entities, deposits in excess of two million </p><p>naira (equivalent to USD 17,800).  The NDLEA, however, is </p><p>given the lead in investigating money laundering offenses as </p><p>it is granted sweeping powers to: place any bank account </p><p>under surveillance; tap any telephone line; access any </p><p>computer system; and obtain any private communications of </p><p>financial or commercial records.  The CBN is not given these </p><p>investigative powers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4(SBU) The law contains adequate provisions for the </p><p>prosecution of individuals directly involved or abetting the </p><p>laundering of drug proceeds, including bank officials and </p><p>even entire corporate entities.  Tough penalties of </p><p>imprisonment up to 25 years are prescribed for convicted </p><p>offenders.  The responsibility of proving the criminality of </p><p>proceeds, however, is not clearly defined -- whether the </p><p>prosecution,s to prove through investigation or the </p><p>defendant,s to show that the proceeds were of a legitimate </p><p>nature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Authorities </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) As noted above, the NDLEA is clearly identified as </p><p>the lead agency charged with investigating and prosecuting </p><p>money laundering.  The CBN is identified as a cooperating </p><p>agency in monitoring banks, though criminal investigative </p><p>powers are reserved for the NDLEA.  As of this writing, the </p><p>NDLEA has a Money Laundering Directorate (upgraded earlier </p><p>this year from a former sub-entity under the NDLEA,s </p><p>Investigations Directorate) consisting of the Assistant </p><p>Director heading this office and a staff of 15, of which 10 </p><p>are investigators.  This Directorate has no working fax or </p><p>international communications capability; communications to </p><p>Directorate staff requires passing a message through the </p><p>NDLEA Headquarters numbers or using the Assistant Director,s </p><p>personal cellular phone.  The Directorate has no vehicles and </p><p>has not yet prosecuted any money laundering case.  Though the </p><p>NDLEA has the legal authority to demand regular bank </p><p>reporting of deposits above the 500,000 naira threshold and </p><p>to demand bank records in the pursuit of a specific </p><p>investigation, it lacks the resources to store and analyze </p><p>this information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) The CBN, also identified by the 1995 law as a </p><p>competent authority, houses a small Money Laundering </p><p>Surveillance Unit (MLSU) in Lagos.  This unit is charged with </p><p>receiving reports from Nigeria,s 50-plus banks on deposits </p><p>over the 500,000 naira threshold and licensing the banks, </p><p>operations, including the selection of their senior </p><p>officials.  The CBN seems to have much better relationships </p><p>with the banks it regulates, and it can conduct </p><p>administrative investigations but it does not have arrest or </p><p>prosecution powers.  The CBN,s Deputy Governor, in a recent </p><p>discussion with Emboffs (ref a), also cited the existence in </p><p>Abuja of a CBN "International Financial Transactions </p><p>Surveillance Office (IFTSO)" that seeks to coordinate </p><p>inter-agency monitoring of potential international money </p><p>laundering through Nigeria, though the output of this office </p><p>is unclear.  Indeed, given the CBN,s lack of law enforcement </p><p>jurisdiction, it is unlikely that such a body could produce </p><p>criminal investigations and prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Through its close interaction with Nigeria,s banks, </p><p>the CBN seems to understand the fundamentals of money </p><p>laundering better than the NDLEA, but it lacks the law </p><p>enforcement power endowed the NDLEA to demand bank records. </p><p>In a simple but poignant analysis of this dueling authority, </p><p>one official noted that "the NDLEA has the brawn and the CBN </p><p>the brain, but the two don,t work well together." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Definitional Differences Mask Deficiencies </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) In talks with Nigerian law enforcement officials, </p><p>actions often described as pertaining to "money laundering" </p><p>are in fact the seizure of cash assets directly related to </p><p>crimes.  Under various Nigerian laws -- e.g. the 1995 "419" </p><p>advance-fee fraud law -- physical and cash assets seized by </p><p>law enforcement personnel through the course of enforcement </p><p>action are subject to forfeiture upon conviction.  When </p><p>pressed for elaboration, however, these officials admit that </p><p>few or no additional or separate criminal cases are opened </p><p>into the movement of criminal proceeds; i.e. the </p><p>investigation of bank records or the investigation of </p><p>individuals abetting the placement of criminal funds.  When </p><p>defendants are prosecuted for organized crime activities -- </p><p>drug trafficking, 419 fraud, car theft -- money laundering is </p><p>seldom if ever added as a charge for prosecution.  In a </p><p>recent meeting with Post\'s RNLEO, the Director General of the </p><p>West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management </p><p>(WAIFEM), a former senior CBN official, stated that there has </p><p>not been one money laundering case prosecuted in Nigeria. </p><p>While this statement remains unverified, it highlights the </p><p>anemic law enforcement response to Nigeria,s considerable </p><p>money laundering problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The FATF,s Naming of Nigeria as a "NCCT" </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) In declaring Nigeria a "Non-Cooperating Country or </p><p>Territory (NCCT)," the Africa-Middle East Review Group </p><p>(AMERG) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) pointed to </p><p>the lack of the a response from the GON to 12 questions posed </p><p>in a formal letter from the AMERG as part of the AMERG,s </p><p>review.  The FATF report also cites several apparent serious </p><p>deficiencies in Nigeria,s money laundering control regime. </p><p>Unfortunately, the GON seems to have focussed on its failure </p><p>to respond to the AMERG,s questionnaire in a timely fashion </p><p>as the cause of its NCCT status, while not paying due </p><p>attention to the substantive concerns of the AMERG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) In the FATF,s formal NCCT report, Nigeria was </p><p>faulted for deficiencies in the areas of the FATF,s NCCT </p><p>criteria: 5, 10, 17, 19, and 24. (the report and the entire </p><p>list of NCCT criteria can be found on the FATF,s website -- </p><p>www.oecd.org/fatf) These criteria, in order, are: a) </p><p>inadequate rules for the licensing and creation of financial </p><p>institutions, including assessing the backgrounds of managers </p><p>and beneficial owners; b) excessive secrecy provisions; c) </p><p>lack of identification of the beneficial owner(s) of legal </p><p>and business entities; d) administrative obstacles to </p><p>international cooperation; and e) lack of an exchange of </p><p>mutual legal assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) Clearly some of these cited deficiencies are the </p><p>result of the GON,s failure to respond to the FATF,s </p><p>questionnaire.  The perceived failure of the GON to install </p><p>an adequate structure to screen bank managers, beneficial </p><p>owners and account holders may not take into account some </p><p>provisions under Nigerian law and within CBN regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) On the other hand, the FATF review strangely omits </p><p>any failure of Nigeria to comply with FATF recommendation </p><p>number 4 -- "extending the offense of drug money laundering </p><p>to one based on serious offenses."  Neither does the review </p><p>note that fails to meet NCCT criterion number 29 --"absence </p><p>of a financial intelligence unit or of an equivalent </p><p>mechanism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No Full Coverage of Predicate Offenses </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(SBU) Nigeria lacks a money laundering law that covers the </p><p>full range of money laundering derived from "serious </p><p>offenses" (FATF Recommendation number 4).  Most observers </p><p>agree that the 1995 law should be amended or superceded by </p><p>legislation that allows for additional predicate offenses. </p><p>There is a move afoot, led by the NDLEA, to expand the 1995 </p><p>law to cover a number of specific offenses including those </p><p>mentioned in para 2.  Clearly this is essential for an </p><p>effective anti-money laundering effort in Nigeria and we </p><p>should support it.  In promoting this legislative reform, </p><p>however, the NDLEA wishes to maintain its supremacy in </p><p>coordinating all of Nigeria,s anti-money laundering efforts. </p><p> This would essentially put the NDLEA into a much broader </p><p>legal mandate on criminal investigations -- cutting across </p><p>jurisdictions of the Police, Central Bank, and the </p><p>Anti-Corruption Commission.  We do not see this as practical </p><p>or advisable.  The NDLEA is struggling to fulfill its current </p><p>mandate as a drug enforcement agency; it does not have the </p><p>resources to carry out effectively such a broad mandate and </p><p>scope of responsibility.  We are encouraging the Office of </p><p>the Presidency to create a new centralized unit to fulfill </p><p>this function, such as the proposed Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission (see below). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No Financial Intelligence Unit or Central Body </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(SBU) Closely related to this deficiency is the need to </p><p>replace the NDLEA with a centralized government unit that can </p><p>coordinate government-wide anti-money laundering activities, </p><p>serve as a clearinghouse for intelligence, and serve as a </p><p>central interface for international queries on money </p><p>laundering investigations.  Highlighting all of these </p><p>deficiencies is our recent request, based on President </p><p>Bush,s new Executive Order of September 23 seeking to freeze </p><p>the assets of suspected terrorists, to screen accounts </p><p>connected with 27 individuals identified by the USG as </p><p>terrorists.  The Government of Nigeria is not able to provide </p><p>a full response, as there is no one centralized database on </p><p>money laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Commitment: A new Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.(SBU) In part responding to international concern over </p><p>Nigeria,s money laundering problem, President Obasanjo is </p><p>currently planning the creation of a Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission (FCC) that would centralize all law enforcement </p><p>and policy coordination against myriad financial crimes in </p><p>Nigeria.  This proposal originated in the office of the </p><p>President,s Special Advisor for Drugs and Financial Crimes </p><p>and sought to create an agency akin to the NDLEA that would </p><p>conduct a more aggressive and better coordinated law </p><p>enforcement effort against financial fraud and money </p><p>laundering.  The proposed FCC apparently would reside in the </p><p>Office of the President and would have full investigative and </p><p>prosecutorial powers.  It would be staffed by officers on </p><p>detail from the Police, NDLEA, CBN, and other security </p><p>agencies.  We see this as the best option for Nigeria,s </p><p>addressing the FATF,s concerns -- offering an agency that </p><p>could centralize the GON,s anti-money laundering campaign </p><p>while housing a "FIU" to serve as a clearinghouse for money </p><p>laundering intelligence in part to improve cooperation with </p><p>the international community.  In an October 8 meeting with </p><p>the Ambassador, President Obasanjo,s National Security </p><p>Advisor stated that the FCC proposal would soon be sent to </p><p>the National Assembly for approval; he expressed confidence </p><p>that the FCC would be created by the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
