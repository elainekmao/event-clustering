<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Nigeria: Biweekly Energy Report No. 1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(This is the first in a series of biweekly reports on the </p><p>energy sector in Nigeria.  Information for these reports </p><p>will be culled from open sources as well as contacts by the </p><p>Mission with key players, official and commercial, in </p><p>Nigeria\'s oil and gas-producing community.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  In late December, the Government of Nigeria </p><p>(GON) released 24 billion Naira to its international oil </p><p>joint venture partners in payment of arrears outstanding </p><p>since the last era of military rule (l994-99).  The deferral </p><p>of payments had slowed investment by Nigeria\'s joint </p><p>partners in the oil and gas sector in recent years.  Seeking </p><p>to increase local content, the GON is pressing for </p><p>indigenous companies to account for at least 40 percent of </p><p>human and material inputs in new projects, and is </p><p>encouraging Nigerians to raise local content in the sector </p><p>by funding areas where they have expertise. Gas flaring is </p><p>down and use of natural gas is up. President Obasanjo </p><p>announced a 2004 target for ending gas flaring, but some </p><p>companies may be exempt from this deadline, at least </p><p>temporarily.  A fire at the Nigeria National Petroleum </p><p>Company (NNPC) headquarters completely gutted the building </p><p>the day before Christmas.  Theories for the cause run from </p><p>arson to cover up wrongdoing to another tragic accident. </p><p>Septel will provide details. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Cash Calls </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The longstanding delay that foreign oil companies had </p><p>encountered in obtaining cash call payments for the period </p><p>1994-99 has been partially resolved, according to press </p><p>reports.  In late December, the NNPC reportedly made </p><p>payments totaling 24 billion naira (about 185.0 million USD) </p><p>to operators of joint ventures.  Cash call payments defray </p><p>the government\'s share of operating costs under joint </p><p>venture arrangements in which the GON holds a 57 percent </p><p>share.  The arrears date back to military rule during the </p><p>Abacha years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  While the arrears in nairas have been liquidated for </p><p>1994-1999, an industry source told us January 6 that the </p><p>NNPC has not liquidated the foreign exchange component of </p><p>the arrears outstanding for that period.  There is </p><p>disagreement over the amount owed.  The foreign companies </p><p>put the amount at 500 million USD while the government </p><p>claims 300 million USD is owed.  The deferral of the dollar </p><p>payments has meant slower development of new fields.  The </p><p>naira component allows companies to make local purchases and </p><p>pay local staff salaries.  The U.S. currency permits </p><p>companies to obtain needed services and supplies offshore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Our source added that the cash call payment to his </p><p>company last month meant that the payments that it received </p><p>in 2002 were the largest in fifteen years.  Our source said </p><p>the NNPC is current in its naira and dollar cash call </p><p>payments to the company going back to the year 2002.  Some </p><p>dollar arrears for the period before 2000 remain </p><p>outstanding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The delay in cash call payments had seriously restricted </p><p>foreign oil companies\' ability to expand production and had </p><p>added extra costs to their operations.  The companies had </p><p>partly compensated by reducing the number of rigs operating, </p><p>retiring staff prematurely or cutting back on the work </p><p>force, merging departments, and dropping some employee </p><p>perks. In the future, the issue of cash call arrears should </p><p>be eliminated, as the GON shifts to Production Sharing </p><p>Contracts (PSC\'s) as the means to develop hugely capital- </p><p>intensive deep off-shore fields. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Indigenous Investment </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The GON is encouraging Nigerian entrepreneurs to </p><p>participate actively in the oil and gas industry.  Toward </p><p>this end, the GON wants to see the local content of current </p><p>and future projects raised to at least 40 percent.  Part of </p><p>the problem facing start-up firms has been lack of capital. </p><p>One of the ways of getting a foothold in the industry has </p><p>been through purchase of existing fields with proven </p><p>reserves.  This usually has meant acquiring marginal fields </p><p>or acquiring part or all of the GON\'s equity in a joint </p><p>venture. Marginal fields are fields that foreign companies </p><p>have abandoned because they appeared no longer to be </p><p>commercially viable.  The GON requires that marginal fields </p><p>be set aside for indigenous companies with expertise in </p><p>specific technical areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Another avenue of entry into the market for Nigerian </p><p>entrepreneurs is through the provision of services to the </p><p>oil and gas industry. However, most Nigerian firms do not </p><p>have the financial ability to compete with the international </p><p>firms that provide services to the industry.  Few Nigerian </p><p>firms can do this now because sophisticated technical skills </p><p>and advance equipment are required.  Most Nigerian </p><p>entrepreneurs lease equipment at present.  Nigerians are </p><p>nonetheless hoping to find a niche through which to supply </p><p>selected services to the industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Because Nigeria\'s primary source of revenue and means to </p><p>"good" employment is the oil and gas industry, businessmen </p><p>are learning about opportunities for partnerships, and </p><p>entrepreneurs are emerging.  Since Nigeria\'s focus in the </p><p>coming years will be on offshore production of oil and gas, </p><p>some Nigerian entrepreneurs may specialize in deep-sea </p><p>diving services.  Other Nigerian firms are considering </p><p>arrangements for provision of leased drilling rigs to </p><p>production companies.  Some have opted to supply pipes for </p><p>oil and gas lines.  Other Nigerian firms want to produce </p><p>drilling mud and associated chemical products.  The </p><p>challenge for these firms will be producing chemicals that </p><p>conform to American Petroleum Institute standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Natural Gas Sector </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.   President Obasanjo recently announced plans to end gas </p><p>flaring by 2004 while he was attending the January 7 </p><p>commissioning of an industrial gas project in Ogun State. </p><p>The President conditioned his statement, saying "some of the </p><p>oil companies might be exempted from the 2004 deadline." </p><p>Technical Assistant to the NNPC Group Managing Director, </p><p>Austen Oniwon tells us that most flaring will not end by </p><p>2004. Oniwon predicted the next significant reduction of </p><p>flaring will occur when the LNG Trains 4 and 5 become </p><p>operational in 2005 or 2006. (Note: About 50 percent </p><p>associated gas is now flared compared to more than 70 </p><p>percent in the mid-1990s.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>NNPC Fire </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Lagos office of the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) was completely gutted by fire on December </p><p>24.  The building, located on Ikoyi Island in Lagos, housed </p><p>the offices of the Nigerian Petroleum Investment Management </p><p>Services (NAPIMS), which is responsible for GON investments </p><p>in the oil industry, and the Pipelines and Products </p><p>Marketing Company (PPMC), whose mandate is marketing </p><p>petroleum products. The leader of the Youth Democratic </p><p>Movement (a previously unknown group) claimed responsibility </p><p>for what is commonly believed to have been arson.  Some of </p><p>our industry sources have speculated that NNPC employees </p><p>seeking to cover up details of long-term fraud within NNPC </p><p>set the building on fire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. While the implications of the fire are being sorted out, </p><p>it should be noted that joint ventures (JV) account for </p><p>approximately 90 percent of Nigeria\'s oil production. </p><p>NAPIMS supervises the JV operations so the destruction of </p><p>NAPIM\'s records may have an adverse impact on oil production </p><p>capacity, especially for new fields for which NAPIMS is </p><p>presently processing contracts.   The fire purportedly began </p><p>on the eighth floor of the building, which housed NAPIMS, </p><p>and later re-ignited on the second floor, where PPMC was </p><p>located.   Although the files of the GON\'s oil investments </p><p>and joint venture activities are reportedly backed up at </p><p>NNPC\'s headquarters in the capital and at the international </p><p>oil company offices, it remains to be seen how many of the </p><p>NNPC records can be validly and reliably reconstituted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The payment of cash calls to companies was long overdue. </p><p>While the Obasanjo Administration has made efforts to pay </p><p>legitimate debts incurred during military rule, the </p><p>international oil companies still suffered when their cash </p><p>call payments were held up.  The NNPC\'s foreign partners </p><p>have had to delay development of projects, shut down rigs, </p><p>downsize and retrench in other ways to cut expenditures. </p><p>Added to this has been the uncertainty of when payment in </p><p>dollars will be made for the years prior to 1999 and in what </p><p>amount. That said, the Obasanjo Administration has done a </p><p>much better job in cleaning up cash call arrears than any </p><p>contemporary Nigerian government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Given that many indigenous companies will work marginal </p><p>oil fields, we plan to address the political and economic </p><p>importance of progress on these fields in septels.  The GON, </p><p>in its effort to encourage local content, may have to move </p><p>cautiously since most indigenous companies lack funds and </p><p>expertise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. We have reason to believe that the investigation of the </p><p>NNPC fire is not being conducted in a serious manner and </p><p>will never determine the cause of the blaze (see septel). </p><p>We also do not know yet what the eventual cost of the NNPC </p><p>inferno will be.  In recent years, major suspicious fires </p><p>consumed the Lagos offices of the Ministry of Defense and </p><p>NITEL (Nigerian Telecommunications).  With or without facts, </p><p>the general assumption is that arson to cover up misdeeds </p><p>was the cause and the investigation will flicker and </p><p>eventually die out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hinson-Jones </p><p></p></div>
