<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 002488 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, NEA/NGA, PRM/ANE, AND </p><p>IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC AND ORHA </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 05/27/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG MEDEVACS WOUNDED IRAQIS FOR MEDICAL </p><p>TREATMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 2303 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary and comment: The UAE Red Crescent </p><p>Authority facilitated 5/21 the medical evacuation from </p><p>Kuwait of more than two dozen wounded and sick Iraqi </p><p>civilians and their parental guardians.  This was the </p><p>largest medical airlift of its kind of Iraqi wounded, </p><p>and fulfilled a long-standing pledge of UAE President </p><p>Shaykh Zayid Al-Nahyan to bring injured and sick </p><p>Iraqis to the UAE for free medical treatment.  The UAE </p><p>Air Force has since conducted smaller evacuation </p><p>flights (three or four patients each) from Baghdad, </p><p>Mosul, and Basra, with Post\'s assistance.  We applaud </p><p>the tireless efforts of the Humanitarian Operation </p><p>Center (HOC) in Kuwait, which oversaw the </p><p>identification and transport of patients to the </p><p>waiting UAE aircraft, and provided the required travel </p><p>documents for the Iraqis\' entry into the UAE.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Working in conjunction with various medical </p><p>NGOs in Iraq, the HOC identified and coordinated the </p><p>transportation of 27 patients and 15 parental </p><p>guardians to Kuwait International Airport (KIA) 24 </p><p>hours prior to the airlift.  The Iraqi patients were </p><p>then loaded aboard a UAE presidential Amiri Flight, </p><p>outfitted with 30 stretchers.  According to our </p><p>colleagues in the HOC who observed the mission, the </p><p>UAE Red Crescent medical team immediately triaged the </p><p>patients, and began coordinating their medical </p><p>requirements in the UAE before the flight departed </p><p>Kuwait.  Upon arrival to Abu Dhabi, the Red Crescent </p><p>transported the patients to the exclusive Al-Mafraq </p><p>Hospital -- considered one of the best hospitals in </p><p>the UAE.  The UAE Health Ministry cleared an entire </p><p>ward for the patients -- seven of who remain in </p><p>intensive care -- and provided room and board for </p><p>family members. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The patients come from all areas of Iraq -- </p><p>some were transported from the critical care Spanish </p><p>medical ship in the Gulf -- and include men, women, </p><p>elderly, and more than 10 children.  The Iraqis suffer </p><p>from various ailments, including war wounds (i.e. </p><p>shrapnel wounds, gun shot wounds, severe burns) as </p><p>well as diseases that require specialized treatment </p><p>not available in Iraq (i.e. cancers and tumors).  One </p><p>child in particular, Ali Mousa Soudi -- suffering from </p><p>Cystic Hygroma X and requiring immediate laser surgery </p><p>-- has since become the darling of the UAE press </p><p>corps. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: It is unfortunate that the initial </p><p>headline about the airlift in the local newspapers </p><p>focused on Ali Mousa\'s father and his false claims </p><p>that the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait blocked efforts to </p><p>evacuate his family to the United States.  Econoff </p><p>arranged for a phone call between the Al-Mafraq </p><p>pediatric surgeon and Ali Mousa\'s father the day </p><p>before the airlift, and he was convinced then that his </p><p>son would receive first-class medical treatment in the </p><p>UAE.  Nevertheless, subsequent news articles here have </p><p>focused on the positive aspects of the medical airlift </p><p>and probably will continue to track the progress of </p><p>the Iraqi patients and their eventual return home. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
