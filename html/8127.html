<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002889 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FBI FOR DIRECTOR MUELLER FROM AMBASSADOR GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KCRM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: YOUR MAY 31 - JUNE 1 VISIT TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Director Mueller: It was a pleasure speaking with you </p><p>last week regarding your upcoming visit to the region.  As </p><p>you will recall, at that time I was not certain whether King </p><p>Abdullah or GID Director Sa\'ad Kheir would be in Jordan at </p><p>the end of the month or traveling abroad.  I am happy to </p><p>report that the Palace has just informed us that the King and </p><p>Sa\'ad, along with PSD director Tahseen Shurdom, will be in </p><p>Amman May 31 - June 1 and available to meet with you on June </p><p>1.  As we discussed, your visit will offer a timely </p><p>opportunity to review the excellent cooperation we have with </p><p>the Jordanians on a range of law enforcement and security </p><p>issues and to discuss ideas for most effectively working </p><p>together in the future. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) I would like to extend once again an invitation for </p><p>you to stay with me at the Residence, if that would be </p><p>convenient.  I could accommodate one other senior member of </p><p>your staff as well.  Due to space limitations, other members </p><p>of your delegation would spend the night at a nearby hotel. </p><p>Please let me know what your preferences are and we will plan </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Once again, I look forward to seeing you in Amman on </p><p>May 31 for what I am sure will be a productive dialogue with </p><p>the Jordanians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Warm Regards, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Edward W. "Skip" Gnehm </p><p>Ambassador </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
