(C) SUMMARY: DURING AN HOUR\'S MEETING OCTOBER 2 </p><p>THREE MEMBERS OF THE UN/UNDP MISSION SEARCHED FOR AN </p><p>OPENING IN OUR POSITION ON THE CURRENT LAND REFORM </p><p>IMPASSE TO REKINDLE DONOR DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE.   THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>AND EMBASSY OFFICERS STRESSED THAT THE USG WANTS TO BE </p><p>HELPFUL BUT RULE OF LAW AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY MUST </p><p>BE ESTABLISHED IN ZIMBABWE.  THE UN/UNDP TEAM SKETCHED </p><p>OUT THE LINES OF A POSSIBLE PACKAGE THAT AT ONCE WOULD </p><p>BE FACE SAVING FOR MUGABE, RETAINING THE FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH TO LAND REFORM, AND SATISFY DONOR QUALMS ABOUT </p><p>INVESTING HERE.  ESSENTIALLY THE DONORS WOULD OFFER TO </p><p>PAY FOR 211 UNCONTESTED FARMS CURRENTLY ON OFFER AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD END THE LAWLESSNESS ON THE FARMS AND </p><p>EMBARK ON A DIALOGUE ON LARGER POLITICAL ISSUES. </p><p>WITHOUT KNOWING ALL THE DETAILS, WE WERE POSITIVE BUT </p><p>REGISTERED OUR CONCERN THAT THE PLAN BE RATIONAL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05608  01 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>ACHIEVABLE.  THE TEAM APPEARS GENUINELY INTERESTED IN </p><p>REACHING A RESOLUTION TO THE CURRENT IMPASSE AND IT IS </p><p>FACILITATING THE SORT OF COMMUNICATION AND DIPLOMACY </p><p>THAT IS CURRENTLY IN SHORT SUPPLY HERE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON OCTOBER 3 UN/UNDP MISSION MEMBERS CHONCHOL, </p><p>OKOTH AND BARUT MET WITH AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, THE DCM, </p><p>ACTING USAID DIRECTOR MARTIN AND USAID OFFICER LOKEN FOR </p><p>AN HOUR TO TAKE SOUNDINGS ON THIS EMBASSY\'S VIEW ON </p><p>RESUMING DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE ON </p><p>LAND REFORM.  BY WAY OF PREFACE, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>WELCOMED THE MISSION MEMBERS AND CONVEYED HIS </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR TASK.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE USG VIEWED A TRANSPARENT AND ORDERLY </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAM AS NECESSARY FOR ZIMBABWE AND INDEED </p><p>A MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, HOWEVER, WHAT WAS OCCURRING </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY NOW DID NOT MEET THAT DEFINITION.  HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO RESTORE RULE OF LAW ON </p><p>THE FARMS AND THE USG REMAINED CONCERNED FOR THE FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WOULD BE DISPLACED IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK EXERCISE.  IF PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>WERE TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE </p><p>OFF THE LAND, THE AMBASSADOR REASONED, MOST OF THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS WOULD LEAVE AND THE POLICE COULD MOP UP ANY </p><p>RECALCITRANT RINGLEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD CONTINUED THAT THE USG HAD </p><p>PLEDGED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAM THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN </p><p>LAND TENURE CENTER, BUT THAT RECENT EVENTS HAD SEVERELY </p><p>CURTAILED SUCH SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES.  HE OBSERVED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05608  01 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>THE USG COULD CONTINUE TO HELP WITH MONEY FOR TECHNICAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND EVEN RESETTLEMENT, BUT </p><p>IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FUNDS TO BUY LAND. </p><p>HANDING OVER A NON-PAPER THAT REFLECTED DONOR </p><p>PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RESUME </p><p>DIALOGUE ON LAND REFORM, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE </p><p>MISSION MEMBERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH US, LEST THEY GET </p><p>AHEAD OF OUR POSITION ON THIS MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHONCHOL CONCEDED THAT THE MISSION HAD MET ONLY </p><p>WITH THE INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMER\'S UNION (ICFU) AND </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) AND WOULD MEET WITH </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE ON OCTOBER 3.  HE OBSERVED </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO ACCELERATE ITS LAND REFORM </p><p>GOAL BUT IT HAD LITTLE MONEY, AND SO IT CHANGED THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  "PEOPLE SAY," CHONCHOL CONTINUED, THAT </p><p>THERE\'S NEED FOR DIALOGUE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD </p><p>CONDUCT LAND REFORM IF IT HAD FUNDS.  THE DONORS, ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, WILL NOT GIVE MONEY UNLESS THERE IS RESPECT </p><p>FOR THE LAW.  "WHAT IS FOR YOU THE RULE OF LAW?" </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD REPLIED THAT THE U.S. WAS NOT </p><p>INTERESTED IN GETTING INTO A DEBATE ON SEMANTICS.  THE </p><p>FARM OCCUPATIONS AND THE ATTENDANT VIOLENCE HAD BEEN A </p><p>ZANU-PF CAMPAIGN TACTIC, BUT NOW THE ELECTION WAS OVER. </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE, WHICH IS QUITE GOOD, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4692 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05608  02 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------8D0764  031613Z /38 </p><p>P 031613Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7269 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 005608 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05608  02 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/UNDP MISSION MEMBERS SEEK EMBASSY VIEWS </p><p>ON RESUMING LAND REFORM DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ </p><p> </p><p>SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO ITS JOB, THE AMBASSADOR SAID. </p><p>HE ALSO SAID THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD ENFORCE COURT </p><p>ORDERS AGAINST TRESPASSERS, AS WELL AS FIND AND </p><p>PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS WHO PERPETRATED SERIOUS CRIMES </p><p>FROM DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY TO MURDER IN THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CHONCHOL THEN ASKED WHERE SHOULD THE PEOPLE </p><p>ALREADY ON THE FARMS BE PUT, SINCE TO REMOVE THEM </p><p>SUMMARILY WOULD PRESENT THE GOVERNMENT A POLITICAL </p><p>PROBLEM.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS\' UNION HAD OFFERED FARMS VOLUNTARILY.  CHONCHOL </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 211 FARMS HAD BEEN OFFERED, BUT THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT REACTED TO THE OFFER.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SPECULATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ACCEPT </p><p>THE FARMS BUT WOULD WANT MORE.  USAID OFFICER LOKEN </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAD EXPENDED </p><p>ITS ENTIRE BUDGET AND NOW HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR FARMS. </p><p>UNTIL IT DID, IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE THE FARMERS.  POLITICS </p><p>PLAYED A PART AS WELL: WHEN THE FARMERS INITIALLY </p><p>INSTITUTED A SUIT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESPONDED WITH SILENCE; WHEN THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05608  02 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>UNION DROPPED THE SUIT, COMMUNICATION RESUMED.  WITH THE </p><p>SUIT NOW REINSTATED, ATTITUDES WERE HARDENING AGAIN, </p><p>LOKEN OBSERVED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) "COULD DONORS HELP WITH MONEY?" CHONCHOL </p><p>INQUIRED.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT THE DONORS WERE </p><p>PREPARED TO EXPLORE SEVERAL OPTIONS, PROVIDED THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW WAS RESPECTED.  OKOTH OBSERVED THAT THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW ARGUMENT APPEARED TO EMBRACE GOVERNANCE IN GENERAL </p><p>IN THE ZIMBABWEAN CONTEXT.  "WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>CORDON IT OFF ONLY TO APPLY TO LAND?"  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ANSWERED THAT, "WE WANT TO FOCUS ON LAND, BUT LIFE </p><p>DOESN\'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM.  WE WANT TO SOLVE THE LAND </p><p>QUESTION, BUT THERE IS NO CLEAR LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS </p><p>HAPPENING ON THE FARMS AND IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE."  OKOTH REJOINED THAT IN 1998 THE DONORS </p><p>HAD COMMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LAND REFORM PROCESS, </p><p>WHEREAS NOW THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE COMPLAINED THAT </p><p>THE DONORS STARTED RAISING EXTRANEOUS ISSUES.  USAID </p><p>OFFICER LOKEN REPLIED THAT THE RULE OF LAW QUESTION WAS </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION.  UNTIL </p><p>MACROECONOMIC STABILITY WAS ACHIEVED, NO DONOR WOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED TO INVEST IN ZIMBABWE.  OKOTH THEN SAID THAT </p><p>PERHAPS THE WAY TO PUT IT WAS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MADE A COMMITMENT TO SOLVE THE LAWLESSNESS ISSUE THEN WE </p><p>CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE ON THE BIGGER POLITICAL ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BARUT RETURNED TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE WAS </p><p>ROOM FOR DIALOGUE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK </p><p>PROGRAM, AND WHETHER ANY TINKERING COULD BE DONE TO MAKE </p><p>IT ACCEPTABLE TO THE DONORS.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05608  02 OF 04  031613Z </p><p>THAT WE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE PROGRAM </p><p>ENTAILED.  HAVING TALKED ABOUT IT TO SIX MINISTERS, "I </p><p>STILL DON\'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A PROGRAM," THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR OBSERVED.  BARUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>MISSION WAS ATTEMPTING TO FIND OUT AS WELL.  HE THEN </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE DONOR COMMUNITY DISPUTED THE 5 MILLION </p><p>HECTARE GOAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE INTENDED TO </p><p>ACQUIRE.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT MUCH DEPENDED ON </p><p>THE WILL OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCEED SERIOUSLY AND IN A </p><p>RATIONAL WAY.  THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED THAT THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION SHOULD PROCEED IN STAGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>CAPACITY AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, YET WITHIN A LONGER- </p><p>TERM FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNMENT\'S GREATER 5M HA </p><p>OBJECTIVE.  OKOTH THEN ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE </p><p>TO GO BACK TO THE INCEPTION PHASE, PUT THE PEOPLE ON THE </p><p>LAND SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PLACE THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM </p><p>WITHIN THE INCEPTION PHASE?  ACTING USAID DIRECTOR </p><p>MARTIN SAID THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AS, IN ESSENCE, </p><p>THAT WOULD MEAN RETURNING TO THE PROGRAM APPROVED BY ALL </p><p>PARTIES AT THE 1998 DONORS\' LAND CONFERENCE.  USAID </p><p>OFFICER LOKEN SUPPLEMENTED THE ANSWER BY OBSERVING THAT </p><p>WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE MOMENT WAS UNACCEPTABLE, </p><p>UNPLANNED, UNDEMOCRATIC AND NOT TRANSPARENT.  "HOW DO WE </p><p>KNOW THAT RIGHT PEOPLE ARE BEING PLACED ON THE FARMS," </p><p>HE ASKED.  MANY SERIOUS ISSUES, SUCH AS PLACING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4694 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05608  03 OF 04  031614Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------8D0770  031614Z /38 </p><p>P 031613Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7270 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 005608 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05608  03 OF 04  031614Z </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/UNDP MISSION MEMBERS SEEK EMBASSY VIEWS </p><p>ON RESUMING LAND REFORM DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ </p><p> </p><p>QUALIFIED WORKERS ON FARMS, HAD TO BE DEALT WITH BEFORE </p><p>THE DONORS WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT IT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) OKOTH AGREED THAT IT HAD TO BE A RATIONAL AND </p><p>ACHIEVABLE PROGRAM.  BARUT SUGGESTED ONE APPROACH MIGHT </p><p>BE TO START WITH THE 211 FARMS, UNDERSTANDING THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT NEEDED MONEY BOTH TO PURCHASE THESE FROM THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, MOVE THE PEOPLE ON THE FARMS </p><p>TO THEM, AND TRAIN THE LAND RECIPIENTS IN MODERN FARMING </p><p>METHODS.  IF A TRANSPARENT TRUST FUND IS SET UP AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWED TO SAVE FACE, WOULD THE DONORS BE </p><p>SATISFIED?  ACTING USAID DIRECTOR MARTIN REPLIED THAT </p><p>THE TARGET OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S CURRENT LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM WAS THE WAR VETERANS, MANY OF WHOM ARE THUGS </p><p>PAID TO CAUSE MAYHEM AND NOT QUALIFIED TO FARM.  THEY </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE MOVED TO THE 211 FARMS.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD CONCURRED, NOTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>CREATED A PROBLEM FOR ITSELF AND THE DONORS COULD NOT BE </p><p>SEEN TO BE REWARDING LAWLESSNESS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) SUMMING UP WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM US AND HIS </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN INTERLOCUTORS TO DATE, BARUT SAID THAT "WE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05608  03 OF 04  031614Z </p><p>NEED A PACKAGE" TO OFFER THE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE A CLEAR COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW ON THE FARMS.  FROM THAT BASE </p><p>DONORS AND GOVERNMENT COULD BUILD.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTED TO DIFFERENT LOCAL INITIATIVES THAT WERE UNDER </p><p>WAY AROUND THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDLANDS </p><p>PROVINCE, TO BRIDGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FARMER, WAR </p><p>VETERAN AND GOVERNMENT AND SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THESE </p><p>WOULD BEAR CLOSE STUDY.  CHONCHOL RECALLED A FORMULA </p><p>THAT WOULD APPORTION 20 PERCENT OF THE FARMS TO THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS, WHICH THE DONORS HAD ACCEPTED EARLIER.  LOKEN </p><p>RESPONDED IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CUT SUCH A DEAL NOW, </p><p>GIVEN PAST ACTIONS AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY ASSURANCE THAT </p><p>ANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAD ANY QUALIFICATIONS WHATSOEVER </p><p>BEYOND THEIR LOYALTY TO ZANU-PF AND MUGABE.  ACTING </p><p>USAID DIRECTOR MARTIN SUGGESTED THAT A WIN-WIN FORMULA </p><p>WOULD BE A RETURN TO THE 1998 AGREEMENT WHICH ALL </p><p>PARTIES ACCEPTED.  THE DONOR CAPITALS WERE LOOKING FOR A </p><p>RATIONAL PLAN, SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAD </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO PRESENT, DESPITE NUMEROUS, FAILED HIGH </p><p>LEVEL MISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) OKOTH OBSERVED THAT IN TALKING TO THE CFU HE </p><p>WAS STRUCK BY HOW CONFIDENT IT SEEMED ABOUT TAKING ON </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THE FARMERS HAD A </p><p>GODFATHER BEHIND THEM.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD REPLIED THAT </p><p>IF SO, IT WAS NOT THE UNITED STATES.  THE BRITISH ARE </p><p>PREPARED TO PAY FOR LAND WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE, BUT THE </p><p>USG WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO AT THIS TIME.  CHONCHOL </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD RESPOND TO CFU </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE IN KIND AND THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05608  03 OF 04  031614Z </p><p>HARD-LINER WHO WOULD NOT CHANGE HIS POSITION UNLESS HE </p><p>SAW THAT IT WAS IN HIS INTEREST TO DO SO.  LOKEN THOUGHT </p><p>THAT ONE POSSIBLE WAY OUT MIGHT BE THROUGH THE ECONOMIC </p><p>MODELING THAT THE WORLD BANK WAS DOING, LOOKING AT THE </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT VARIOUS COMBINATIONS AND </p><p>PERMUTATIONS OF LAND USE MIGHT HAVE TO REACH A CONSENSUS </p><p>WAY FORWARD.  MARTIN TOLD HIS INTERLOCUTORS NOT TO LEAVE </p><p>THE MEETING WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS NO DONOR </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO HELP.  ON THE CONTRARY, A GREAT RESERVE </p><p>OF GOOD WILL EXISTED, BUT WE CAN NO LONGER TAKE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSURANCES ON FAITH. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT:  THE TEAM MEMBERS HAVE DONE THEIR </p><p>HOMEWORK AND ARE EXCELLENT IN THE ART OF INDIRECT </p><p>INTERROGATION.  CONTRARY TO OUR PRIOR IMPRESSION, THEY </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST IN FINDING SOME </p><p>RESOLUTION TO THE CURRENT IMPASSE.  IN OUR DISCUSSION </p><p>THE ELEMENTS OF THE TEAM\'S PROPOSALS BEGAN TO COME TO </p><p>LIGHT.
