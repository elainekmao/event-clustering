<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, EUR/NB </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-23-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, NO, UK, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Facilitators slated to meet Sri Lankan PM in </p><p>London and, in separate meeting, will try to meet Tigers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1085, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Norwegian facilitators are scheduled </p><p>to meet with PM Wickremesinghe in London late June 23. </p><p>The Tamil Tigers\' London-based spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham has also indicated that he will try to meet </p><p>the GoN team.  In other peace process-related </p><p>developments, local elections in the north/east have </p><p>been postponed following a Supreme Court ruling.  The </p><p>recent uptick in activity by the facilitators is </p><p>potentially good news for the stalled peace process. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LONDON MEETING WITH PM:  Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators are scheduled to meet with Sri Lankan Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in London late June 23. </p><p>(Note:  The PM is in the UK from June 22-28.  After his </p><p>meetings in London, including with PM Blair, he is </p><p>scheduled to go on a brief vacation to Scotland.)  Tomas </p><p>Stangeland, polchief at the Norwegian Embassy, told us </p><p>that Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen and Special </p><p>Envoy Erik Solheim hoped to use the meeting to review </p><p>ways to break the stalemate affecting Sri Lanka\'s peace </p><p>process.  Specifically, Stangeland said the Norwegian </p><p>team wanted to use the meeting to review the </p><p>government\'s thinking on ways to meet the LTTE\'s demand </p><p>for the immediate formation of an interim administration </p><p>in the north/east.  (Note:  In a national TV address </p><p>given on June 19, the PM pledged that his government was </p><p>willing to create such an interim structure, but he did </p><p>not provide much by way of details -- See Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GON-LTTE MEETING LIKELY:  The Tamil Tigers\' </p><p>London-based spokesman Anton Balasingham has also agreed </p><p>to try to meet the Norwegian team.  While a time and </p><p>place for the meeting has not yet been set, Stangeland </p><p>thought it likely that the meeting would take place </p><p>either on June 24 or 25.  As far as the agenda of the </p><p>meeting, Stangeland said the Norwegian side planned to </p><p>take up the interim administration issue by passing the </p><p>LTTE any additional information it gleans on the matter </p><p>from PM Wickremesinghe.  Stangeland said the GoN hoped </p><p>that the meeting with Balasingham produced a </p><p>constructive discussion, such as the one that the </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka had with Tiger </p><p>officials on June 18 (see Reftels). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When queried, Stangeland said he doubted that </p><p>Balasingham would be meeting with any of the high-level </p><p>GSL officials who are visiting London as part of the </p><p>prime minister\'s delegation.  (Note:  The PM\'s </p><p>delegation includes Ministers G.L. Peiris and Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, two key GSL figures on peace process matters.) </p><p>While not fully discounting the possibility of such a </p><p>meeting, Stangeland said he did not think that the </p><p>Tigers would agree to one unless they thought that the </p><p>GSL had taken solid steps toward meeting their demands. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) LOCAL ELECTIONS IN NE POSTPONED:  In other </p><p>peace process-related developments, the government has </p><p>postponed local elections in the north/east until early </p><p>next year.  The GSL\'s move follows an adverse ruling by </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court on June 18.  In its </p><p>complicated decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the </p><p>government needed a two-thirds or more majority in </p><p>Parliament in order to pass a bill it had submitted that </p><p>would allow parties to adjust their original ballot </p><p>nominations for the elections.  Explaining its ruling, </p><p>the Supreme Court said the bill\'s particulars were too </p><p>important simply to require majority support and needed </p><p>a "super-majority."  (Note:  As with the other local </p><p>elections in Sri Lanka, those in the north/east had been </p><p>originally scheduled to take place in early 2002.  For </p><p>various reasons, the GSL postponed the north/east </p><p>elections until the second half of 2003, while the local </p><p>elections in other areas went ahead in 2002.  In moving </p><p>forward its bill, the GSL was trying to meet the demand </p><p>of several Tamil parties -- who were apparently backed </p><p>by the LTTE -- that the original ballot nominations be </p><p>scrapped and re-submitted.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The impact of the Supreme Court\'s ruling was to </p><p>effectively undermine the government\'s bill.  Explaining </p><p>the situation, Joseph Pararajahsingham, a MP with the </p><p>Tamil National Alliance, told us that the GSL simply </p><p>could not get the two-thirds or more support necessary </p><p>to pass the bill.  (Note:  The governing coalition </p><p>controls at most 130 of the 225 seats in Parliament and </p><p>is basically unable to get the 150-plus votes needed for </p><p>bills requiring two-thirds or more support.) </p><p>Pararajahsingham, who maintains close links with the </p><p>LTTE, said it was unfortunate that the government had </p><p>been forced to postpone the elections again.  Noting </p><p>that he thought the nomination lists should be revised, </p><p>he said people in the north and east wanted the vote to </p><p>take place as soon as possible, so the local councils </p><p>could become active again.  (Note:  Since early 2003, </p><p>the local councils in the north/east have become </p><p>inactive due to the fact that office holders have had to </p><p>leave office as their terms ended.  Without fresh </p><p>elections, there is no one to replace the former office </p><p>holders.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The recent uptick in activity by the </p><p>facilitators is potentially good news for the stalled </p><p>peace process.  After a brief hiatus in contacts, the </p><p>Norwegians met with the Tigers last week and -- as </p><p>reviewed above -- seem likely to meet Balasingham in </p><p>London this week.  Through these meetings, hopefully, </p><p>the Norwegians will be able to help break the current </p><p>impasse, so that talks can start up again.  That said, </p><p>there is little indication that the Tigers plan to be </p><p>especially accommodating unless the government takes </p><p>steps toward forming an interim structure in the </p><p>north/east.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
