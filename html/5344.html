<p>S E C R E T STATE 023994 </p><p> </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/23/13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, EFIN, ECON, PREL, SA, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING - UPDATED NONPAPER ON AL </p><p>HARAMAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 22362 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY EB A/S E. ANTHONY WAYNE, REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) THIS CABLE REPLACES THE EARLIER VERSION OF THE NON- </p><p>PAPER SENT OUT IN REFTEL. PLEASE DISCARD EARLIER VERSION. </p><p>CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST </p><p>CONVEYED BY NSC STAFF, ARE THE FOLLOWING: REFERENCE TO </p><p>U.S. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF U.S. BRANCH HAS BEEN </p><p>DELETED AND DELETIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SECTION </p><p>III(A) (1) (A). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) IN MEETINGS ON JANUARY 28, S/CT COFER BLACK AND NSC </p><p>RAND BEERS SHOULD DELIVER THE NONPAPER IN PARA 3, AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S - RELEASABLE TO SAUDI ARABIA) BEGIN NONPAPER: </p><p> </p><p>I.  INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>ONE OF THE TOP COUNTER-TERRORISM PRIORITIES OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IS TO DEEPEN THE LEVEL OF THE ONGOING DIALOGUE </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA RELATING TO </p><p>FINANCIAL FLOWS TO AL-QA\'IDA. RECENT INTELLIGENCE </p><p>REPORTING INDICATES THAT AL-QA\'IDA IS HAVING TROUBLE </p><p>RAISING MONEY AND THAT IT IS MORE RELIANT THAN EVER ON </p><p>SAUDI FINANCIAL SOURCES, PARTICULARLY WEALTHY DONORS AND </p><p>FUNDING DIVERTED FROM CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. ALTHOUGH </p><p>REPORTING USUALLY DOES NOT SPECIFY THE IDENTITIES OF </p><p>DONORS AND CORRUPT CHARITABLE OFFICIALS, WE BELIEVE EVEN </p><p>THESE MORE GENERAL LEADS WILL ALLOW OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS TO </p><p>IDENTIFY AND LOCATE TERRORIST SUPPORTERS. FINDING THESE </p><p>PEOPLE AND STOPPING THE FINANCIAL FLOWS - WHETHER THROUGH </p><p>PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ACTION - WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPEDE THE AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA LEADERSHIP\'S ABILITY TO RECONSTITUTE THE GROUP AND </p><p>LAUNCH DEVASTATING NEW ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, AND ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>MOVING EXPEDITIOUSLY TO CUT FUNDING IS CRITICAL BECAUSE </p><p>RECENT REPORTING SUGGESTS AL-QA\'IDA IS POISED TO ATTACK </p><p>TARGETS WITHIN THE KINGDOM USING MONEY IT HAS RAISED FROM </p><p>SAUDI SOURCES. WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE YOU </p><p>WITH SUCH INFORMATION LINKING SAUDI FINANCIERS TO AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA PLOTS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- FOR EXAMPLE, IN LATE DECEMBER 2002, A DETAINEE REVEALED </p><p>THAT AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES HAD RECEIVED 25,000 SAUDI RIYALS </p><p>FOR PLANNED ATTACKS AGAINST US TARGETS IN SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>USING AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES AND HAND GRENADES. </p><p> </p><p>-- A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID HE HAD HEARD AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA OPERATIVES DISCUSSING PLOTS AGAINST ARAMCO </p><p>FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>SOME AL-QA\'IDA SUPPORTERS HAVE OPPOSED TO ATTACKS WITHIN </p><p>THE KINGDOM ONLY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE SUCH ATTACKS WOULD </p><p>JEOPARDIZE ONGOING FUNDRAISING AND LOGISTICAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>IN OCTOBER, A SAUDI-BASED FINANCIAL FACILITATOR ADVISED AN </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVE ALONG THESE LINES.    HIS STATEMENT </p><p>SUGGESTS THE OPERATIVES ARE CURRENTLY RAISING FUNDS WITHIN </p><p>THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>II. AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCIAL SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>RECENT REPORTING INDICATES THAT AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCIAL </p><p>NETWORK HAS BEEN DISRUPTED AND THAT IT IS RECEIVING FEWER </p><p>FUNDS. THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF </p><p>TERRORISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS </p><p>SUCCESS. PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT HAVE BEEN AL-QA\'IDA\'S </p><p>LOSS OF A SECURE BASE IN AFGHANISTAN, THE DETENTION OF </p><p>NUMEROUS AL-QA\'IDA FINANCIAL OFFICIALS, AND DONORS\' </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE THEY FEAR PUNISHMENT OR </p><p>ARE DISENCHANTED WITH THE LACK OF ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>-- AS EARLY AS MARCH, AN ASSOCIATE OF A SENIOR USAMA BIN </p><p>LADIN LIEUTENANT COMPLAINED THAT HIS SOURCE OF FINANCIAL </p><p>DONATIONS HAD DRIED UP AND THAT HE WAS "FORCED TO BEG FOR </p><p>FUNDS." </p><p> </p><p>-- IN MARCH, AN AL-QA\'IDA ASSOCIATE WHO MANAGES AN </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FUNDRAISING WEBSITE INDICATED THAT DONATIONS </p><p>FOR THE JIHAD "WOULD SOON DRY UP" WITHOUT CURRENT </p><p>INFORMATION FROM THE FRONT TO ATTRACT FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN MARCH, A SENIOR FIGURE IN BIN LADIN\'S PROPAGANDA </p><p>NETWORK INDICATED THAT CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATIONS, </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS WERE LACKING. </p><p> </p><p>-- A DETAINEE REVEALED THAT AS OF LATE 2002 IT HAD BECOME </p><p>EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AL-QA\'IDA TO TRANSFER MONEY TO </p><p>OPERATIVES. REPORTS OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS INDICATE </p><p>THAT AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES IN IRAN, PAKISTAN, AND YEMEN ARE </p><p>IN NEED OF MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN OCTOBER, ONE AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVE SPOKE OF DEVELOPING </p><p>PROPAGANDA "TO BOOST DONOR CONFIDENCE," WHILE ANOTHER AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA MEMBER WORRIED THAT A FAILED OPERATION WOULD STOP </p><p>DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN OCTOBER, A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA MEMBER RECEIVED DRAFT </p><p>PLANS FOR A TERRORIST OPERATION TO BE PRESENTED TO </p><p>PROSPECTIVE BENEFACTORS.   THIS FOLLOWED OTHER REPORTING </p><p>INDICATING AL-QA\'IDA WAS HAVING TROUBLE ATTRACTING MONEY </p><p>FROM HARD-CORE SAUDI DONORS, WHO WERE "CLAMORING TO SEE </p><p>THE FRUITS OF THEIR DONATIONS." THE PLANS PRESUMABLY WERE </p><p>INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE DONATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>AS FUNDS BECOME SCARCE, AL-QA\'IDA IS TRYING TO REBUILD ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL NETWORK TO SUSTAIN ITS LEADERSHIP AND FUND NEW </p><p>ATTACKS. REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT AL-QA\'IDA IS TURNING TO </p><p>LONGSTANDING SOURCES OF MONEY IN SAUDI ARABIA, NOTABLY </p><p>WEALTHY DONORS WHO PROVIDE MONEY WITTINGLY AND CHARITIES </p><p>FROM WHICH CORRUPT OFFICIALS DIVERT MONEY. DURING </p><p>CUSTODIAL INTERVIEWS IN MID-2002, A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE SAID THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR AL-QA\'IDA AMONG WEALTHY SAUDIS. HE SAID THE SUPPORT </p><p>IS LARGELY FINANCIAL BUT ADDED THAT SAUDI SUPPORTERS ALSO </p><p>FACILITATE TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF THE KINGDOM. THE SENIOR </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE SUPPORT IS TYPICALLY </p><p>"COVERT," AS SUPPORTERS FEAR THEY WILL BE PUNISHED IF TIES </p><p>TO AL-QA\'IDA BECAME KNOWN. </p><p> </p><p>MONEY THAT ORIGINATES IN THE KINGDOM IS DISPERSED TO AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA MEMBERS IN AFGHANISTAN, INDONESIA, IRAN, PAKISTAN, </p><p>THE PHILIPPINES, YEMEN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE KEY AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA OPERATIVES HAVE RELOCATED OVER THE PAST YEAR </p><p>FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF AFGHANISTAN AS A SAFEHAVEN. FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, AL-QA\'IDA MEMBERS IN YEMEN-A KEY PLATFORM FOR </p><p>OPERATIONAL PLANNING IN THE GULF-ARE GETTING THE MAJORITY </p><p>OF THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM SAUDI ARABIA. IN MAY, </p><p>SAUDI-BASED AL-QA\'IDA FACILITATOR AND CURRENT DETAINEE ABD </p><p>AL-RAHMAN AL-QASIMI SUGGESTED MOST TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN </p><p>YEMEN WERE FUNDED BY INDIVIDUALS "AT HIS LOCATION," I.E. </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO A VARIETY OF RECENT REPORTING INCLUDING </p><p>STATEMENTS BY KEY AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES, WEALTHY DONORS - </p><p>PROBABLY MAINLY BUSINESSMEN - HAVE PROVIDED THE BULK OF </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA\'S FUNDING SINCE AT LEAST THE LATE 1990S. AS AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA STRUGGLES TO REGROUP, IT IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED </p><p>IN TAPPING THIS SOURCE OF FUNDS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED WITH </p><p>WHICH SMALL GROUPS CAN PROVIDE TENS OR HUNDREDS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.   MOST OF THE REPORTING WE HAVE ON </p><p>RECENT AL-QA\'IDA EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MONEY INDICATES THE </p><p>GROUP PREFERS TO APPROACH DONORS DIRECTLY. FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>-- A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL </p><p>SAUDIS AS PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO AL-QA\'IDA, </p><p>INCLUDING IBADAH AL-MAKKI, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHO USED TO </p><p>SEND TRAINEES AND MONEY, AND SAWAD AL-MADANI, A SAUDI WHO </p><p>SUPPLIED AL-QA\'IDA WITH MEN, EXPERTISE, EQUIPMENT, AND </p><p>MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>-- OTHER SAUDI DONORS IDENTIFIED BY A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDE ANJANSHAH, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHO </p><p>USED TO SEND "A LOT" OF MONEY TO BIN LADIN LIEUTENANT ABU </p><p>ZUBAYDAH; QUTAYBAH, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHOSE POSITION AS A </p><p>MOSQUE IMAM ENABLED HIM TO RAISE FUNDS FROM "ORDINARY </p><p>PEOPLE" AND SEND THE FUNDS FOR THE JIHAD; AND THABIT, A </p><p>SAUDI NATIONAL WHO HAS EXTENSIVE RELATIONS WITH SHAYKHS </p><p>FROM WHOM HE GETS "GOOD" DONATIONS FOR THE JIHAD. </p><p> </p><p>-- ANOTHER DETAINEE TOLD INTERROGATORS IN EARLY 2002 THAT </p><p>SAUDI DONORS HAD PROVIDED $106,667 FOR OPERATIVE TRAVEL. </p><p>IN APRIL THE DETAINEE ADMITTED THAT HE COLLECTED $100,000 </p><p>FROM MOSQUES AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN SAUDI ARABIA. THE </p><p>DETAINEE ALSO TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT AL-QA\'IDA COLLECTED </p><p>FUNDS FROM SAUDI MERCHANTS IN THE AREAS OF AL-QASIM AND </p><p>RIYADH. THE FUNDS WERE SENT TO AFGHANISTAN VIA RANDOMLY </p><p>SELECTED SAUDI EXTREMISTS TRAVELING TO JOIN AL-QA\'IDA </p><p>FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS (NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>OR "NGOS") ARE A SECOND SOURCE OF MONEY FOR AL-QA\'IDA. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SEVERAL NGOS THAT SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA, SUCH AS </p><p>WAFA AND MAKTAB AL-KHIDMAT, HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN, WE ARE </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THEIR DONORS ARE STILL AT LARGE. REPORTING </p><p>INDICATES AL-QA\'IDA AND AFFILIATED TERRORIST GROUPS ARE </p><p>STILL RECEIVING MONEY FROM SAUDI CHARITIES WITHIN THE </p><p>KINGDOM, VIA CORRUPT OFFICIALS WHO DIVERT CHARITABLE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE GROUP.   FOR EXAMPLE, IN A </p><p>POSSIBLE EFFORT TO GIVE AL-HARAMAIN HEADQUARTERS AND </p><p>FOREIGN DONORS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY TO CHARGES THAT FUNDS </p><p>SENT TO INDONESIA WERE FUNNELED TO EXTREMISTS, IN LATE </p><p>2001 AL-HARAMAIN ROUTED FUNDS TO THE INDONESIA MISSION </p><p>THROUGH A THIRD PARTY INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY TO JAKARTA </p><p>DIRECTOR AL-AMOUDI. </p><p> </p><p>-- AL-HARAMAIN\'S INDONESIA OFFICE HAS TIES TO SEVERAL AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA AFFILIATED INDIVIDUALS-INCLUDING UMAR FARUQ-AS WELL </p><p>AS JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) LEADER ABU BAKAR BASHIR (VARIANT </p><p>BA\'ASYIR). </p><p> </p><p>-- HIGH-RANKING JI MEMBERS, INCLUDING IMAM HANAFEI, HAVE </p><p>BEEN KNOWN TO CONSORT WITH THE "COMMITTEE OF SHAYKHS," </p><p>RAISING A POSSIBLE LINKAGE BETWEEN SAUDI MONEY, INDONESIAN </p><p>MILITANT GROUPS, AND AL-QA\'IDA. </p><p> </p><p>III. OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER REDUCE AL-QA\'IDA\'S FUNDING </p><p> </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA\'S SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS SUGGEST THAT </p><p>EFFORTS TO FIND AND BLOCK MONEY FLOWS PRESENT AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO DISRUPT TERRORISTS\' OPERATIONS AND PREVENT </p><p>THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP FROM REBUILDING THE ORGANIZATION BY </p><p>FINDING AND SHUTTING OFF THE MONEY FLOW FROM MAJOR DONORS </p><p>AND FROM CORRUPT OFFICIALS OF CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>     A. CUTTING CHARITY TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA </p><p> </p><p>RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT HUMANITARIAN WORK UNDERTAKEN BY </p><p>CHARITIES, THE FACT THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DIVERT </p><p>RESOURCES INTENDED FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES AND SOMETIMES </p><p>CORRUPT THEIR EMPLOYEES IS PARTICULARLY APPALLING. WE </p><p>RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN, AS WELL AS YOUR COMMITMENT </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST ABUSE OF </p><p>ISLAMIC CHARITIES BY TERRORISTS. IT IS EXTREMELY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER CORRUPTION IN CHARITIES AND TO </p><p>PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE US </p><p> </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE BENEVOLENCE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION, </p><p>HAS BEEN LONG AND DIFFICULT, AND WE HAVE YET TO ACQUIRE </p><p>ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO INDICT THE FOUNDERS OF BIF FOR </p><p>COMPLICITY IN TERRORIST SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING CHARITABLE FUNDS ARE NOT DIVERTED TO </p><p>TERRORISTS IS LIKELY TO BE A LONG PROCESS. BETTER </p><p>OVERSIGHT OF CHARITIES\' SPENDING AND VETTING OF THEIR </p><p>EMPLOYEES EVENTUALLY WILL MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>TERRORISTS TO DIVERT FUNDS FROM THEM. IN THE NEAR TERM, </p><p>REMOVING OFFICIALS ENGAGED IN TERRORIST SUPPORT AND </p><p>QUESTIONING THEM TO UNCOVER OTHER COMPLICIT OFFICIALS </p><p>WOULD QUICKLY REDUCE DIVERSIONS OF MONEY TO AL-QA\'IDA. </p><p> </p><p>     1. A PRIORITY CASE: THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC </p><p>FOUNDATION </p><p> </p><p>A CHARITY OF GREAT IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>ISLAMIC FOUNDATION. OF COURSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN PROVIDES LEGITIMATE HUMANITARIAN AID, BUT WE </p><p>REMAIN VERY CONCERNED THAT PERSONNEL IN ALMOST HALF OF ITS </p><p>50 OFFICES, INCLUDING PERSONNEL WITHIN THE KINGDOM, ARE </p><p>AIDING AND ABETTING AL-QA\'IDA AND ITS AFFILIATED TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH SOME INFORMATION ON AL-HARAMAIN\'S </p><p>ILLEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER; HOWEVER, WE </p><p>NOW HAVE A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE ON THE CHARITY\'S </p><p>COMPLICIT EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS HOW IT SUPPORTS TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE COMPILED ON AL-HARAMAIN INDICATES </p><p>THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE BOSNIA AND SOMALIA BRANCHES </p><p>AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN JOINT ACTION, OFFICIALS OF </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER BRANCHES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE TIES TO AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA AND RELATED TERRORIST GROUPS. AMONG THESE BRANCHES </p><p>IS THE US BRANCH. IN ADDITION TO CURRENT AND FORMER AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WITH YOU, </p><p>RECENT REPORTING IMPLICATES THE CHARITY\'S DIRECTOR, SHAYKH </p><p>AQIL IBN \'ABDUL-\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL. FINALLY, WE REMAIN </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT RECENT REPORTS INDICATING THAT AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN\'S BRANCH OFFICES IN BOSNIA AND SOMALIA CONTINUE </p><p>TO RECEIVE FUNDS FROM AL-HARAMAIN HEADQUARTERS DESPITE OUR </p><p>JOINT ASSET FREEZE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN LEARN MORE, </p><p>AND STOP THE ABUSE OF AL-HARAMAIN BY TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>     A. INFORMATION PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY ON THE AL- </p><p>     HARAMAIN ISLAMIC FOUNDATION </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, VARIOUS U.S. INTERLOCUTORS HAVE DISCUSSED </p><p>WITH YOUR VARIOUS AGENCIES OF YOUR GOVERNMENT A RANGE OF </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC </p><p>FOUNDATION SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. WE HAVE ALSO </p><p>PROVIDED INFORMATION TO YOU ABOUT THE BASIS OF THESE </p><p>CONCERNS, AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THEM. </p><p>THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THOSE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS, THE </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, FROM AUGUST 1998 - NOVEMBER 2002, </p><p>WE HAVE PROVIDED REPORTS TO AND/OR ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE </p><p>FROM THE MUBAHITH RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN. SEVERAL OF OUR REPORTS AND INQUIRIES RELATED TO </p><p>THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS IN AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA\'S BOMBINGS OF US EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA. OF </p><p>PARTICULAR NOTE AMONG THESE IS MU\'AMMAR AL-TURKI ABD AL- </p><p>WAHHAB AL-DAHKIL. WE ALSO HAVE PROVIDED LEADS ON SEVERAL </p><p>OTHER AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE </p><p>TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>INFORMATION IN LATE 1999 AND LATE 2001 NOTING HOW AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES IN GENERAL HELPED AL-QA\'IDA WITH </p><p>FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT </p><p>SOME FUNDS WERE FLOWING FROM AL-HARAMAIN THROUGH THE </p><p>REMITTANCE FIRM AL-BARAKAT TO AL-QA\'IDA\'S ALLY, AL-ITTIHAD </p><p>AL-ISLAMI (AIAI). </p><p> </p><p>A LEAD TO MAHMUD BAHAZIQ, SUSPECTED FINANCIER OF PAKISTANI </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP LASKAR-E-TAYYIBA WHO MAY HAVE TIES TO AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON JANUARY 16, 2002, AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY BURNS PROVIDED TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD A PROPOSAL FOR JOINT U.S. AND SAUDI </p><p>ACTION TO FREEZE THE ACCOUNTS OF, AMONG OTHERS, THE AL- </p><p>HARMAIN OFFICES IN BOSNIA AND SOMALIA. INFORMATION </p><p>PROVIDED IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. PROPOSAL INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO UBL, EIJ, AND AL-GAMA\'AT AL- </p><p>ISLAMIYYAH: AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OFFICE OF AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>PROVIDED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE EIJ AND UBL ASSOCIATES </p><p>BY DIVERTING BOTH FUNDING AND SUPPLIES FROM LEGITIMATE NGO </p><p>ACTIVITIES. AL-HARAMAIN WAS USED AS COVER FOR THE BOSNIA- </p><p>HERZOGOVINA-BASED EGYPTIAN TERRORIST GROUP, AL-GAMA\'AT AL- </p><p>ISLAMIYYAH. AL-HARAMAIN MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN FUNDED </p><p>DIRECTLY BY USAMA BIN LADIN. ELEMENTS OF AL-HARAMAIN WERE </p><p>INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING ARMS IN SUPPORT OF ISLAMIC </p><p>EXTREMISTS IN BOSNIA-HERZOGOVINA. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SOMALIA\'S AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI (AIAI): </p><p>AS OF APRIL 1999, AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OF AL-HARAMAIN HAD </p><p>FINANCIAL LINKS TO KENYA-BASED AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI </p><p>(AIAI), A MAJOR TERRORIST GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL-QA\'IDA. </p><p>AIAI HAS TRAINED AN ARMED MILITIA WHICH HAS BEEN WAGING A </p><p>RUTHLESS CAMPAIGN FOR CONTROL OF THE GEDO REGION IN </p><p>SOMALIA. AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OF AL-HARAMAIN SUPPORTED </p><p>AIAI IN AL WAQ, SOMALIA, BY SENDING RELIEF FOOD TO AIAI </p><p>MEMBERS IN AIAI CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SDGT WAFA HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION: </p><p>TWO AL-HARAMAIN REPRESENTATIBVES, ABU \'ABDULLAH AND ABU </p><p>MUHAMMAD, ACCOMPANIED ABDUL AL-SABUR (REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>ABU ABDUL-AZIZ, AKA ABU \'ABDULLAY, THE HEAD OF THE WAFA </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION IN KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN), TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, WHERE THEY WERE TO MEET AFGHAN OFFICIALS </p><p>REGARDING THE OPENING OF AN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SDGT MAKHTAB AL-KHIDMAT (MK): AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN MAINTAINED MK FUNDS, "THE BULK OF THE REMAINDER </p><p>OF THE ORIGINAL SUM OF MONEY (USD 2.5 MILLION)," IN ITS </p><p>RAWALPINDI ACCOUNTS. THE FUNDS CAME FROM DONATIONS OF MK. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN STAFFED BY UBL ASSOCIATES AND OTHERS WITH </p><p>TERRORIST TIES: UBL ASSOCIATES HAVE OCCUPIED KEY </p><p> </p><p>POSITIONS IN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES OVERSEAS. IN 1997, AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN KENYA-BRANCH EMPLOYEES WERE ARRESTED AND EXPELLED </p><p>FOR PLANNING A TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>SOME OF THIS PLANNING OCCURRED WITHIN THE AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>OFFICE.  AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIAL, SALAH A.Q. AL-THIBANI, RAN </p><p>THE AL-HARAMAIN-ALBANIA OFFICE.   AL-THIBANI IS A CLOSE </p><p>ASSOCIATE OF UBL OPERATIVE FAHID AL-SHAHRI. THIBANI WAS </p><p>ALSO FOUNDER OF THE IIRO. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN FUNDING OF ISLAMIC JIHAD MOVEMENTS IN YEMEN: </p><p>AS OF MARCH 1999, AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OFFICE OF AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN SUPPORTED THE ISLAMIC JIHAD MOVEMENT AND ITS </p><p>ASSOCIATED FACILITIES IN YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN EFFORT TO REDUCE CORRUPTION OF THE NGO: AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN SENIOR DIRECTORS HAVE SOUGHT TO INSTITUTE </p><p>MANAGERIAL TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR PROSPECTIVE REGIONAL </p><p>OFFICES\' CHIEFS AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANGES THAT </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS WITH A POLITICAL OR TERRORIST AGENDA </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO MISUSE AL-HARAMAIN FUNDS OR OTHER </p><p>RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>-- BASED IN LARGE PART ON THIS INFORMATION AND ADDITIONAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND TREASURY SECRETARY </p><p>O\'NEILL IN MARCH, 2002, THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AGREED JOINTLY TO REFER THE BOSNIA AND </p><p>SOMALIA BRANCHES OF AL-HARAMAIN TO THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE FOR ACTION UNDER UNSCR 1267. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN MAY, 2002, TREASURY OFAC DIRECTOR NEWCOMB LED A </p><p>DELEGATION TO SAUDI ARABIA AND MET WITH VARIOUS OFFICIALS </p><p>TO DISCUSS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEASURES TAKEN BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT OF AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN AND OTHER CHARITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN SEPTEMBER, 2002, U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS DISCUSSED </p><p>WITH FOREIGN MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HH DR. PRINCE TURKI BIN MOHAMMED AL-KABIR </p><p>AL-SAUD, U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN BOSNIA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RE-OPEN, DESPITE THE </p><p>UN SANCTIONS. IN OCTOBER, 2002, AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT COUNTER-TERRORISM COORDINATOR AMBASSADOR </p><p>FRANCIS X. TAYLOR DISCUSSED THESE SAME CONCERNS WITH </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAYIF. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN OCTOBER 2002, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE AL LARSON </p><p>RAISED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT AL-HARAMAIN WITH CROWN PRINCE </p><p>ABDULLAH AND FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN NOVEMBER, 2002, STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>ANTHONY WAYNE ASKED CROWN PRINCE ADVISOR ADEL AL-JUBEIR </p><p>WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA WAS LOOKING CLOSELY </p><p>AT AL-HARAMAIN AND ITS OPERATIONS, GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH THE BOSNIA AND SOMALIA BRANCHES. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES APPRECIATES VERY MUCH THE EFFORTS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, </p><p>INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR THE JOINT REFERRAL TO THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MECHANISMS TO OVERSEE </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES OF CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>     B. NEW INFORMATION ON THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC </p><p>FOUNDATION </p><p> </p><p>DESPITE THE JOINT EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE </p><p>KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO CONTROL THE MISUSE OF AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN RESOURCES BY TERRORISTS, A GROWING BODY OF </p><p>REPORTING INDICATES THAT PERSONS WORKING IN SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND EUROPE FOR AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>ISLAMIC FOUNDATION (HIF) HAVE SUPPORTED -- AND MAY </p><p>CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p>REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT 20 AL-HARAMAIN FIELD OFFICES </p><p>AND REPRESENTATIVES OPERATING IN 50 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, </p><p>ASIA, EUROPE, AND NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS ITS </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN SAUDI ARABIA, APPEAR TO BE PROVIDING </p><p>FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO AL-QA\'IDA. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, HIF OFFICIALS PROVIDE </p><p>FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO BIN LADIN ASSOCIATES AND </p><p>OTHER RADICALS BY DIVERTING FUNDS AND SUPPLIES FROM </p><p>LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, KENYAN AUTHORITIES </p><p>DE-REGISTERED AL-HARAMAIN AS WELL AS THREE OTHER NGOS FOR </p><p>"SUBVERSIVE" ACTIVITIES BY ITS EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING THE </p><p>AUGUST 1998 BOMBING IN NAIROBI. </p><p> </p><p>-- OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS - SUCH AS AL-ITTIHAD AL- </p><p>ISLAMIYA, HAMAS, EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, LASHKAR-I- </p><p>TAYYIBA, AND FOREIGN MUJAHIDIN IN BOSNIA AND CHECHNYA - </p><p>GET FUNDING FROM HIF OR USE AL-HARAMAIN AS A FRONT FOR </p><p>FUNDRAISING AND OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. JUDGES THAT HIF DIRECTOR SHAYKH \'AQIL IBN \'ABDUL- </p><p>\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL, WHO MANAGES AL-HARAMAIN\'S BUSINESS ON A </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, IS PROVIDING FUNDS TO OFFICES WITH </p><p>TERRORIST TIES IN WAYS THAT WILL AVOID FOREIGN GOVERNMENT </p><p>SCRUTINY, SUCH AS USING PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS TO TRANSFER </p><p>OFFICIAL HIF FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>ANALYSIS OF REPORTING SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER INDICATES THAT </p><p>HIF HEADQUARTERS HAS CHANGED THE WAY IT SENDS FUNDS TO </p><p>OFFICES ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT THE </p><p>MONEY FROM BEING IDENTIFIED OR SEIZED BY FOREIGN </p><p>OFFICIALS. AL-HARAMAIN INCREASINGLY SENDS MONEY TO </p><p>INDIVIDUALS\' ACCOUNTS IN ADDITION TO TRANSFERRING FUNDS TO </p><p>BRANCH OFFICES. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED TRANSFERS THAT </p><p>ORIGINATED FROM SENIOR HIF OFFICIALS\' PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>INCLUDING SHAYKH \'AQIL IN SAUDI ARABIA, TO PERSONAL </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF KNOWN HIF AFFILIATES. HIF ALSO EMPLOYS </p><p>COURIERS TO MOVE MONEY OUTSIDE ELECTRONIC BANKING SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS OF EARLY APRIL 1999, AL-HARAMAIN USED A CENTRALIZED </p><p>SYSTEM THAT PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS FROM ALLOCATING FUNDS </p><p>WITHOUT THE PERSONAL APPROVAL OF THE FOUNDATION\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR. GIVEN THIS SYSTEM, THE QUESTIONABLE TRANSFERS </p><p>SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 SUGGEST THAT GREAT SCRUTINY SHOULD </p><p>BE GIVEN TO SHAYKH \'AQIL. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIF HEADQUARTERS IS LAYERING TRANSFERS, A PRACTICE THAT </p><p>CONCEALS THE ORIGINATOR AND DESTINATION OF THE TRANSFERS. </p><p>HIF HAS REPEATEDLY SENT MONEY TO A BAHRAINI ACCOUNT </p><p>BELONGING TO AN UNSPECIFIED SENIOR HIF OFFICIAL RESIDING </p><p>IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHO SUBSEQUENTLY SENDS THE FUNDS TO HIF </p><p>ACCOUNTS IN NIGERIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- REPORTING INDICATES THAT HIF SENT FUNDS FROM A HIF </p><p>ACCOUNT IN SAUDI ARABIA TO AN AL-ANSAR WELFARE TRUST IN </p><p>KASHMIR.  AL-ANSAR WELFARE TRUST IS A FRONT FOR LASHKAR-I- </p><p>TAYYIBA (LT) AND TEHRIK UL-MUJAHIDIN, WHICH HAVE BEEN </p><p>LISTED BY THE UNITED STATES AS TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN MID-NOVEMBER 2001, UNSPECIFIED AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS </p><p>MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF WAFA, AN NGO RUN BY AL-QA\'IDA, </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF WAFA OPENING AN HIF BRANCH </p><p>IN IRAN TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO AL-QA\'IDA </p><p>AFTER WAFA ASSETS WERE FROZEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIF EMPLOYEES\' ACCOUNTS IN ALBANIA PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED </p><p>MONEY FROM AN HIF OFFICIAL ACCOUNT AT AL-RAJHI BANK, BUT </p><p>IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TRANSFERS HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THE </p><p>PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF HIF\'S EUROPEAN COMMITTEE DIRECTOR, </p><p>HESHAM AL-MASHARI. </p><p> </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN SAUDI EMBASSIES IN SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTRIES APPEAR TO BE WITTING OF, AND SOMETIMES </p><p>ASSISTING, HIF BRANCH OFFICES THAT SUPPORT EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS. FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTING INDICATES THAT AS OF LATE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2001 ACCREDITED SAUDI DIPLOMATS AT THE SAUDI </p><p>EMBASSY IN BOSNIA COORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN TO FORMER ARAB MUJAHIDIN IN BOSNIA. DIPLOMATS IN </p><p>ANOTHER EMBASSIES HAVE OFFERED TO CONCEAL AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>DOCUMENTS FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA. REPORTING INDICATES AL-HARAMAIN MAINTAINS A </p><p>PRESENCE IN ABOUT A DOZEN AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND SUPPORTS </p><p>SEVERAL EXTREMIST GROUPS, PARTICULARLY SOMALIA\'S AL- </p><p>ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI (AIAI). AL-HARAMAIN ALSO MISUSES ITS </p><p>STATUS AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION TO FUND ISLAMIST </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES AND CIVIC GROUPS IN EAST AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES - INCLUDING DJIBOUTI AND COMOROS ISLANDS. IN </p><p>SOME INSTANCES, THE FUNDING EXTENDS TO SUPPORTING </p><p>SECTARIAN VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES PROVIDED </p><p>COVER AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT FOR AL-QA\'IDA CELLS, INCLUDING </p><p>THOSE IN THE 1998 US EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND </p><p>TANZANIA. REPORTING INDICATES MOST OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S FIELD </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTORS IN EAST AFRICA ARE AWARE OF AND SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION\'S AID TO MILITANT EXTREMISTS, AND AT </p><p>LEAST SOME TOP-LEVEL OFFICIALS FROM AL-HARAMAIN\'S </p><p>HEADQUARTERS CONDONE THE FUNDING OF MILITANT EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>REPORTING SUGGESTS AL-HARAMAIN\'S TOP PRIORITY IN AFRICA IS </p><p>SUPPORTING AIAI. AIAI - DESIGNATED BY THE US DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF TREASURY UNDER U.S. EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 AS A FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP - SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN </p><p>"GREATER SOMALIA" INCLUDING PARTS OF ETHIOPIA, DJIBOUTI, </p><p>AND KENYA. UNSPECIFIED HIF OFFICES WORLDWIDE COLLECT </p><p>FUNDS TO PROVIDE AIAI FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ESTABLISH </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOOLS, COURTS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN AIAI- </p><p>INFLUENCED TERRITORY. HIF HAS ALSO HELPED THE FACTION </p><p>DEVELOP ITS INSURGENT AND TERRORIST CAPABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 2002, AL-HARAMAIN ARRANGED TRAVEL FOR AIAI MEMBERS </p><p>TO SAUDI ARABIA, PROBABLY TO HELP THEM AVOID ANTICIPATED </p><p>US MILITARY ACTION IN SOMALIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 2001, HIF PROVIDED HUMANITARIAN COVER FOR </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ARABS TRAVELING TO SOMALIA TO TRAIN AIAI </p><p>MILITARY RECRUITS. AS OF LATE 2001, AL-HARAMAIN RAN A </p><p>MILITARY TRAINING/RECRUITMENT CENTER IN MOGADISHU WITH </p><p>AIAI. YOUNG MEN ATTENDING THIS CENTER RECEIVED PHYSICAL </p><p>FITNESS, MARKSMANSHIP, AND SIMILAR TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>-- DURING SEPTEMBER 2002 AL-HARAMAIN ACCOUNTANTS IN </p><p>SOMALIA EXCHANGED $2 MILLION FOR SOMALI SHILLINGS AT </p><p>MOGADISHU\'S BAKARA MARKET, WHICH OCCURRED AFTER THE JOINT </p><p>DESIGNATION OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S OFFICES IN SOMALIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS OF MID-MARCH 2002, AL-HARAMAIN IN MOGADISHU, SOMALIA </p><p>WAS SCHEDULED TO HOST A CONFERENCE WITH MEMBERS OF AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA ATTENDING. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 1999, HIF MAINTAINED VILLAS IN SOMALIA USED TO STORE </p><p>EXPLOSIVES AND TRAIN AIAI MEMBERS FOR JIHAD OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN ALSO SUPPORTS AIAI FROM ITS OFFICES AND </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS IN KENYA. IN 2001-2002, REPORTING INDICATED </p><p>THAT AL-HARAMAIN\'S KENYAN OFFICES ALSO PROVIDED SUPPORT </p><p>AND COVER TO AIAI OPERATIVES AS WELL AS FUNDED AIAI </p><p>RECRUITMENT EFFORTS IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 2002, AL-HARAMAIN\'S DIRECTOR IN TANZANIA - RAMZI BEN </p><p>MIZAUNI - FUNDED THE MOSQUES IN THE COUNTRY MOST ENGAGED </p><p>IN MILITANT ACTIVITY AND ABUSED THE NGO\'S TAX-FREE STATUS </p><p>TO IMPORT GOODS AND FUNDS IT USED TO SUPPORT MILITANT </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 2001, A GROUP OF UP TO 20 MUSLIM MILITANTS, AT LEAST </p><p>SOME OF WHOM WERE PROBABLY AL-QA\'IDA FIGHTERS FLEEING </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, TRAVELED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO KENYA AND </p><p>TANZANIA UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF AL-HARAMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 1999, THE HEAD OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S MOSQUE DIRECTORATE, </p><p>SHAYKH ABDALLAH GILID AL-MARZUQI, PROVIDED FUNDS TO </p><p>PROMINENT TANZANIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS WHO, IN 1998, HAD </p><p>DISTRIBUTED MONEY TO ISLAMIST DEMONSTRATORS SO THAT THEY </p><p>COULD TURN VIOLENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>IMPLICATED IN AN ABORTED PLOT TO ATTACK THE US EMBASSY IN </p><p>NAIROBI IN 1997. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IN THE FALL OF 1997, </p><p>THE AL-HARAMAIN PROJECT MANAGER IN NAIROBI, ABDEL MALIK, </p><p>WAS POSSIBLY PLANNING TO ASSASSINATE US CITIZENS IN </p><p>NAIROBI, AND INSTRUCTED THREE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTINUE </p><p>SURVEILLANCE OF THE US EMBASSY. THESE ASSOCIATES OF AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN IN KENYA REPORTEDLY POSTPONED AN ATTACK AGAINST </p><p>THE US EMBASSY IN NAIROBI UNTIL AFTER THE KENYAN GENERAL </p><p>ELECTIONS. THE DECISION TO POSTPONE THE ATTACK WAS MADE </p><p>FOLLOWING A 5 SEPTEMBER 1997 VISIT BY THE KENYAN POLICE TO </p><p>THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN ISIOLO, KENYA. </p><p> </p><p>BALKANS. DOCUMENTS SEIZED IN THE BALKANS SUGGEST THAT </p><p>EMPLOYEES AT HIF OFFICES IN ALBANIA, BOSNIA, CROATIA, AND </p><p>KOSOVO SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA AND AFFILIATED GROUPS. </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IN EACH OF THESE OFFICES WERE FUNDED BY OR </p><p>WORKED WITH BIN LADIN. </p><p> </p><p>-- E-MAILS FROM AL-QA\'IDA MEMBERS FOUND IN 2002 ON </p><p>COMPUTERS CONFISCATED FROM THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN </p><p>TRAVNIK, CROATIA CONTAINED INSTRUCTIONS TO ATTACK AN SFOR </p><p>BASE IN TUZLA. </p><p> </p><p>-- FOLLOWING THE 11 SEPTEMBER TERRORIST ATTACKS, OFFICIALS </p><p>AT THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN KOSOVO DESTROYED ALL </p><p>DOCUMENTS THAT COULD LINK THE ORGANIZATION TO MILITANT OR </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. IN LATE 2001, HIF OFFICIALS DECIDED </p><p>TO TEMPORARILY MAINTAIN A LOW PROFILE BEFORE RESUMING </p><p>ILLICIT ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ABU MUNZER, AN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIAL IN SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>URGED ANOTHER AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEE TO DIVERT THE FUNDS OF </p><p>AN UNSPECIFIED DONATION TO THE NEW FACILITY (OSTROGATAIS) </p><p>DESIGNED TO REPLACE AL-HARAMAIN IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN MAY AND JUNE 2002, A SENIOR BOSNIAN-BASED HIF </p><p>OFFICIAL WAS IN CONTACT WITH AN AL-QA\'IDA-ASSOCIATED </p><p>MILITANT WHO WAS PLANNING A TERRORIST ATTACK USING TOXINS </p><p>AND POSSIBLY EXPLOSIVES. </p><p> </p><p>INDONESIA. RECENT REPORTING INDICATES THAT HIF OFFICES IN </p><p>INDONESIA SUPPORT AL-QA\'IDA AND OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS. </p><p>AFTER LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR TIES TO LOCAL EXTREMISTS </p><p>AND ASSURING THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT IT WOULD ENGAGE IN </p><p>"SOCIAL WELFARE" PROJECTS, AL-HARAMAIN APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>ASSUMED A KEY ROLE IN FACILITATING FUND TRANSFERS TO </p><p>EXTREMISTS AFFILIATED WITH LOCAL TERRORIST GROUPS AND </p><p>SUPPORTING MILITANT EXTREMISM AMONG LOCAL MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>REPORTS INDICATE THAT SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST GROUPS CAME </p><p>FROM THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS OF HARAMAIN WITHIN INDONESIA. </p><p>SAUDI NATIONAL AHMAD AL-AMOUDI, DIRECTOR OF THE AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN BRANCHES IN INDONESIA, MET PRIVATELY IN MARCH </p><p>2000 WITH JAFAR UMAR THALIB, LEADER OF THE INDONESIAN </p><p>EXTREMIST GROUP LASKAR JIHAD. AL-AMOUDI NOTED THAT AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN WAS WORKING WITH THALIB ON SEVERAL ONGING </p><p>"PROJECTS." BECAUSE AL-AMOUDI IS SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEEN </p><p>INVOLVED IN RECRUITING MUJAHIDIN TRAINEES IN THE 1990S, WE </p><p>BELIEVE THE "PROJECTS" ARE RELATED TO TERRORIST OR </p><p>EXTREMIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- AL-AMOUDI, WHO WE BELIEVE IS CURRENTLY RESIDING IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, WAS ONE OF THREE PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDING </p><p>FOR JAKARTA-BASED AL-QA\'IDA FACILITATOR \'UMAR FARUQ.   HE </p><p>FREQUENTLY DISBURSED LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH TO FARUQ TO </p><p>PROCURE WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, AND OTHER ITEMS. FARUQ ALSO </p><p>ADMITTED THAT HE DELIVERED $99,000 TO AL-AMOUDI IN APRIL </p><p>2002 AT THE REQUEST OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S DAMMAM, SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR, AND TOLD INTERROGATORS IN JULY THAT HE </p><p>ALSO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM ANOTHER OPERATIVE THROUGH AL- </p><p>HARAMAIN.   IN LATE 2001 AL-HARAMAIN ROUTED FUNDS THROUGH </p><p>A THIRD PARTY INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY TO AL-HARAMAIN JAKARTA </p><p>DIRECTOR AL-AMOUDI. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN WAS ACTIVE IN INDONESIA AND CULTIVATED TIES TO </p><p>LOCAL MILITANT EXTREMIST GROUPS BEFORE OFFICIALLY OPENING </p><p>ITS JAKARTA OFFICE IN MID-JULY 2000. AN AL-HARAMAIN </p><p>CONTRACTOR TRAVELED TO INDONESIA IN 1998. AL-HARAMAIN\'S </p><p>SEASONED STAFF MAY HAVE HELPED THE CHARITY GET ITS </p><p>INDONESIA OPERATIONS ON LINE QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p>AL-AMOUDI PREVIOUSLY SERVED AT AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES IN </p><p>PAKISTAN AND AZERBAIJAN AND MAY HAVE WORKED WITH JAKARTA </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR ADAM NASIR WARSHA IN BANGLADESH. WARSHA </p><p>ALSO CLAIMED HE RECEIVED MILITARY TRAINING FROM THE </p><p>TALIBAN AND/OR FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN MAY BE CONTINUING TO USE ITS PRESENCE IN </p><p>INDONESIA TO IDENTIFY LOCAL RECRUITS FOR JIHAD TRAINING IN </p><p>INDONESIAN CAMPS AND ABROAD; THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>RECRUITING MUJAHIDIN TRAINEES IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>-- FARUQ NOTED THAT AL-HARAMAIN HAD PURCHASED A POWERBOAT </p><p>-- PROBABLY TO ASSIST JIHADISTS - IN AMBON. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HARAMAIN MAY ALSO SUPPORT MILITANT EXTREMISTS THROUGH </p><p>LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS-FARUQ NOTED IN CUSTODIAL INTERVIEWS </p><p>THAT KOMPAK, THE PARAMILITARY WING OF THE INDONESIAN </p><p> </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUP DEWAN DAKWAH ISLAMIYAH INDONESIA, </p><p>RECEIVED UNSPECIFIED ASSISTANCE FROM AL-HARAMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>PAKISTAN.  THE ISLAMABAD OFFICE OF HIF ALSO APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA. THE DIRECTOR OF THE HIF OFFICE </p><p>IN ISLAMABAD SOUGHT PERMISSION FROM THE RIYADH OFFICE IN </p><p>JULY 2002 TO CEASE OPERATIONS FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS TO </p><p>AVOID SCRUTINY FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>UNITED STATES. THE PATTERN OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S OPERATIONS </p><p>OBSERVED INTERNATIONALLY CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE OPERATIONS </p><p>OF THE US-BASED OFFICES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE </p><p>OPENED IN 1997 BY PIROUZ SEDAGHATY AND SOLIMAN ALBUT\'HE </p><p>AKA SOLIMAN HAMAD AL BATAHI, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A </p><p>RANKING OFFICIAL OF AL-HARAMAIN. SEDAGHATY AND ALBUT\'HE </p><p>ARE LISTED AS OFFICIALS OF THE US AL-HARAMAIN OPERATION </p><p>ALONG WITH AQIL AQIL AND AL-HARAMAIN\'S DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN </p><p>OPERATIONS, MANSOUR AL-KADI. AQIL IS BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>IDENTICAL TO SHAYKH AQIL IBN \'ABDUL-\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL, THE </p><p>MANAGING DIRECTOR OF AL-HARAMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>-- SEPARATE REPORTS LINK AL-KADI TO INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE 1998 EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA. </p><p>RECENT REPORTING REVEALED THAT THE HIF\'S US-BASED OFFICES </p><p>RECEIVED $500,000 FROM BIN LADIN. THESE FUNDS WERE </p><p>REPORTEDLY USED TO PURCHASE MOSQUES THAT WOULD BE USED FOR </p><p>RECRUITING EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY, AL-HARAMAIN HAS </p><p>PROVIDED FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT </p><p>HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN INVOLVED IN JIHADIST PARAMILITARY </p><p>TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>-- SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER, SOLIMAN ALBUT\'HE, A/K/A SOLIMAN </p><p>HAMAD AL BATAHI, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A RANKING </p><p>OFFICIAL OF AL-HARAMAIN, HAS PROVIDED OVER $20,000 TO </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES THAT REPORTEDLY </p><p>HAVE PARTICIPATED IN JIHADIST PARAMILITARY TRAINING. </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO BE </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH AL-HARAMAIN. </p><p> </p><p>     B.  CUTTING DONOR TIES </p><p> </p><p>PROBABLY THE BIGGEST, MOST IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON AL-QA\'IDA\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO FINANCE ITSELF WOULD COME FROM CUTTING OFF THE </p><p>FLOWS OF FUNDS FROM MAJOR DONORS.   REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>A SMALL NUMBER OF WEALTHY PEOPLE PROVIDE MUCH, PERHAPS </p><p>MOST, OF AL-QA\'IDA\'S MONEY. REPORTING - INCLUDING </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH DETAINEES - INDICATES THAT SAUDI DONORS </p><p>ARE SENDING TENS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS </p><p>DIRECTLY TO AL-QA\'IDA FUNDRAISERS THROUGH BANKS, HAWALA </p><p>DEALERS, AND CASH COURIERS. CUTTING OFF THIS FLOW - </p><p>THROUGH PUBLIC OR NON-PUBLIC MEANS - WOULD SERIOUSLY </p><p>IMPEDE THE AL-QA\'IDA LEADERSHIP\'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>GROUP\'S COHESION AND SPONSOR NEW ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, REPORTING SELDOM PROVIDES THE TRUE NAMES OF </p><p>DONORS OR FUNDRAISERS. IN MANY CASES, REPORTING REFERS </p><p>ONLY TO NICKNAMES, HONORIFIC TITLES, OR COVER NAMES ("NOMS </p><p>DE GUERRE"). IN ONLY A FEW CASES, SUCH AS UBAYDAH AL- </p><p>QAHTANI, HAS THERE BEEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY THE </p><p>PROBABLE TRUE NAME OF THE PERSON. ADDITIONAL REPORTING </p><p>AND DETAINEE INTERVIEWS HAVE PROVIDED SOME CLUES THAT </p><p>COULD HELP IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL DONORS; HOWEVER, SUCH </p><p>IDENTIFICATIONS WILL REQUIRE VIGOROUS ANALYSIS AND </p><p>QUESTIONING OF KEY SUSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- FIRST, THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INDIVIDUAL DONORS ARE </p><p>ABLE TO PROVIDE SHARPLY NARROWS THE POSSIBLE RANGE OF </p><p>SUSPECTS. MOST MAJOR DONORS PROBABLY ARE WEALTHY </p><p>BUSINESSMEN OR MEMBERS OF WEALTHY BUSINESS FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- SECOND, THE DONORS PROBABLY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED </p><p>TO AL-QA\'IDA. OUR REPORTING INDICATES THAT THEY WANT AL- </p><p>QA\'IDA TO LAUNCH ATTACKS. THEY ARE NOT JUST PAYING MONEY </p><p>IN EXCHANGE FOR "PROTECTION" (THAT IS, AS A BRIBE TO KEEP </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA FROM ATTACKING THEIR INTERESTS). </p><p> </p><p>-- FINALLY, MANY OF THE DONORS PROBABLY KNOW EACH OTHER </p><p>AND MAY EVEN COOPERATE. ONE SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA DETAINEE, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, NOTED THAT AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCE COMMITTEE HAD </p><p> </p><p>A BUSINESS SUBCOMMITTEE WHOSE DUTIES INCLUDED FUNDRAISING. </p><p>SOME REPORTED DONORS AND FUNDRAISERS, SUCH AS WA\'IL </p><p>JULAYDAN, MAINTAIN BUSINESS, CHARITABLE, AND PERSONAL </p><p>CONNECTIONS WITH EACH OTHER, STRENGTHENING OUR SUSPICION </p><p>THAT A LOOSE DONORS\' NETWORK EXISTS. </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN THESE FACTORS, WE HOPE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU BEGINNING </p><p>IN LATE FEBRUARY OR EARLY MARCH OF THIS YEAR IN A DETAILED </p><p>DISCUSSION OF INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION RELATED TO TWO </p><p>PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LINKED TO AL-QA\'IDA - SHAYKH ADIL </p><p>BATTERJEE AND WA\'IL JULAYDAN. THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION, WE </p><p>HOPE TO GAIN A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THEIR TIES TO </p><p>AL-QA\'IDA AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY OTHER FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF TERRORISTS. INDEED, JULAYDAN COULD PROVIDE </p><p>INFORMATION ON OTHER DONORS AND FUNDRAISERS, WHICH MAY BE </p><p>MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAKING FURTHER ACTION AGAINST </p><p>JULAYDAN.   EVEN IF THEY DO NOT COOPERATE, PUTTING </p><p>TOGETHER US AND SAUDI INFORMATION ON BATTERJEE\'S AND </p><p>JULAYDAN\'S PAST AND CURRENT TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA AND OTHER </p><p>POSSIBLE DONORS SHOULD ALLOW IMPROVED ASSESSMENTS OF THE </p><p>GROUP\'S FINANCIAL NETWORK. </p><p> </p><p>CAPTURING AND QUESTIONING FUNDRAISERS, SUCH AS UBAYDAH AL- </p><p>QAHTANI, SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE KEY LEADS TO THE NETWORK. A </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY IS CAPTURING THE HEAD OF AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCE </p><p>COMMITTEE, SHAYKH SA\'ID AL-MASRI. ALTHOUGH HE IS </p><p>EGYPTIAN, SHAYKH SA\'ID MAY WELL HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION </p><p>ON DONORS FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
