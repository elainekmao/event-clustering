<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MA, NI, LI, OAU </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA RESPONDS TO MADAGASCAR DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 119427 </p><p>     B. ADDIS ABABA 2193 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON:  1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Nigeria dislikes the way Ravalomanana came </p><p>to power but likely will not oppose acceptance of his rule. </p><p>Nigeria is not a member of the OAU Central Organ.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Because all GON officials (Presidency and MFA) able </p><p>to discuss Madagascar were unavailable June 20, CDA could not </p><p>make ref A demarche until June 21.  MFA Under Secretary for </p><p>Africa Femi George took essentially the same position as </p><p>Ethiopian State Minister for Foreign Affairs Tekeda (ref B). </p><p>Clearly unhappy with Ravalomanana, George said, inter alia: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ravalomanana had "committed an illegality in the face of </p><p>the OAU." </p><p>-- The "OAU Convention cannot be set aside just because we </p><p>like someone." </p><p>-- "He should not have taken power by force; he should have </p><p>exhausted the Constitutional process." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) George went on to assert that the OAU was trying to </p><p>examine how to contend with the fact that Ravalomanana now </p><p>controlled 80% of Madagascar.  Taking on board our point </p><p>about Ratsiraka\'s departure, George opined that, as a result </p><p>of this action, "we would probably see some movement" in </p><p>Addis.  While Nigeria was not a member of the OAU Central </p><p>Organ and not directly involved in the discussions, it was </p><p>possible that consultations were taking place at the Head of </p><p>State level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: George also alluded to fighting in Liberia, </p><p>worrying that whatever decision the OAU took might set a </p><p>precedent that would affect Liberia, much closer to home and </p><p>more central to Nigeria\'s foreign policy than Madagascar. </p><p>Given Nigeria\'s importance on the continent, it is unlikely </p><p>that Nigeria is not being consulted.  Despite his lengthy </p><p>expression of annoyance at Ravalomanana\'s rise to power by </p><p>means other than a clearly Constitutional transfer of power, </p><p>George indicated that Nigeria would not block an eventual </p><p>acceptance of his government. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
