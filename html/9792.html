<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001302 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, MARR, MASS, SL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VETTING OF NIGERIAN BATTALIONS FOR </p><p>LIBERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 217905 </p><p>     B. FREETOWN 776 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Post has requested the name of the current </p><p>commander of the 26th Infantry battalion as well as other </p><p>key officers in the battalion.  The Nigerian military has </p><p>yet to respond to the request, thus we have not been able </p><p>to vet the names of the battalion commander and his core </p><p>officers.  However, we have checked all available records </p><p>at Post and thus far have found no information indicating </p><p>involvement of that battalion in any gross human rights </p><p>violations.  We also have not found any derogatory </p><p>information about NIBATT 15 currently deployed in Sierra </p><p>Leone under UNAMSIL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Post will vet the names of the battalion commander </p><p>and his senior officers once they have been provided by the </p><p>GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ACTION REQUEST: For Department: Please complete </p><p>human rights vetting for these battalions as soon as possible </p><p>and inform Embassy Abuja of findings. </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
