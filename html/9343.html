FOR WHA/PPC (LOKKA) AND WHA/CEN </p><p>USUN FOR ZAID </p><p>NSC FOR DICARLO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AORC, PHUM, HO, UNGA, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: 58TH UNGA: HONDURAN FM SEEKING APPOINTMENT WITH </p><p>SECRETARY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 184648 </p><p>     B. STATE 175664 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On June 27, PolChief discussed the Government of </p><p>Honduras\' (GOH) participation in the 58th United Nations </p><p>General Assembly (UNGA) and U.S. UNGA policy priorities with </p><p>Honduran Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Anibal Quinones </p><p>(reftels).  Quinones indicated that Honduras looked forward </p><p>to working closely with the U.S. government at the UNGA, </p><p>especially on Iraq-related issues, cloning, and budget </p><p>reform.  Honduras is slated to receive more than USD 40 </p><p>million from the UN HIV/AIDS Global Fund, which makes it the </p><p>largest recipient in Central America. Honduras is also slated </p><p>to be the UNGA Vice President of the Second Committee, where </p><p>we expect to work closely with them on Second Committee </p><p>reform and overall UN budget reform. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) While VM Quinones could only confirm the attendance </p><p>of Foreign Minister Perez-Cadalso at this time, he asked if </p><p>it would be possible to arrange a brief meeting between </p><p>Secretary Powell and FM Perez-Cadalso at the UNGA.  He made a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>direct reference to Honduras being a member of the Coalition </p><p>of the Willing, its recently approved troop deployment to </p><p>Iraq and the ratification of the Article 98 agreement.  He </p><p>subsequently told the Ambassador in a separate meeting that </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been subject to some </p><p>domestic political criticism on both issues and that the </p><p>Maduro government would be very vulnerable to opposition </p><p>party criticism during their troop\'s deployment in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: Post supports this request for a brief </p><p>meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister.  Current </p><p>military planning calls for the Honduran troops to be fully </p><p>deployed to the field by September 1.  In addition to </p><p>solidifying Honduran military participation in the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq, a brief meeting with the FM would </p><p>also provide an opportunity for the Secretary to highlight </p><p>the HIV-AIDS Global Fund\'s contributions in Latin America and </p><p>to engage the Honduran government on the need for it to play </p><p>a leading role in drafting a Cuba human rights resolution at </p><p>next spring\'s UNHRC, now that they have won a seat on that </p><p>body.  The meeting would also send a much-needed and strong </p><p>political boost to the Maduro government and the MFA, both of </p><p>which have been steadfast in support of key U.S. foreign </p><p>policy objectives throughout this year.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
