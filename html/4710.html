(A) ANKARA 8728 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 8596 </p><p>     C. (C) ANKARA 8545 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Three weeks after the state administrative </p><p>court (Danistay) suspended BRSA\'s takeover of Pamukbank, </p><p>there has been no progress toward a permanent resolution. </p><p>Cukurova Holding, which owns both Pamukbank and Yapi Kredi </p><p>Bank, is taking a hard line in talks with the BRSA.  The </p><p>government has said nothing.  IMF officials -- who privately </p><p>say the Danistay ruling cannot be legally justified -- are </p><p>insisting that the government resolve this issue as a </p><p>condition for completing the fourth review.  They argue, </p><p>correctly in our view, that the government needs to stand </p><p>solidly behind BRSA on this case and that failure to resolve </p><p>it positively will undermine both BRSA and the entire bank </p><p>reform effort.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IMF officials tell us that, in the three weeks since </p><p>the Danistay suspended BRSA\'s takeover of insolvent </p><p>Pamukbank, there has been no progress toward a resolution. </p><p>The Danistay has not even forwarded the official decision and </p><p>justification to the BRSA; as a result, the 30-day period in </p><p>which BRSA was to return Pamukbank to the Cukurova Group (and </p><p>restore the group\'s ownership rights over Yapi Kredi Bank) </p><p>has not begun.  In BRSA discussions with Cukurova, the group </p><p>has taken a very hard line:  offering to drop its lawsuits </p><p>against BRSA in return for getting Pamukbank back, complete </p><p>with the nearly $2 billion in assets the BRSA injected into </p><p>the bank when it took it over. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The government has said almost nothing publicly on </p><p>the issue since Prime Minister Gul told the Financial Times, </p><p>shortly after the Danistay decision, that the GOT supported </p><p>bank reform and would not bail out corrupt bank owners.  The </p><p>government has told the IMF that it cannot interfere in the </p><p>case because it is under the purview of the independent </p><p>judiciary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IMF officials tell us privately that they believe the </p><p>Danistay was unduly "influenced" by the Cukurova Group, and </p><p>that there is no legal justification for the Danistay\'s </p><p>decision.  They also note that the AK Party\'s strong </p><p>criticism of BRSA during the election period may have sent </p><p>the wrong signal to any Danistay members who were testing the </p><p>political winds before voting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The IMF is insisting that the Turkish Government find </p><p>a way to resolve the Pamukbank and Yapi Kredi ownership </p><p>issues as a condition for completing the fourth review.  Fund </p><p>staff acknowledge that the government cannot interfere in the </p><p>independent Danistay, but argue that the return of the banks </p><p>to the Cukurova Group poses such a systemic threat to the </p><p>banking system that the Fund cannot ignore it.  Moreover, </p><p>they believe that a failure to resolve this case positively </p><p>(i.e., with BRSA winning) would cripple the BRSA, and thus </p><p>Turkey\'s bank reform efforts.  The solution, they say, is for </p><p>the government to make clear via strong public statements </p><p>that it fully supports its banking regulator in this case. </p><p>This, they believe, would encourage the lower Danistay (which </p><p>supported the BRSA in the initial case and which must now </p><p>make a final decision on it) to consider the case quickly and </p><p>with full knowledge of where the new government stands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Turkey\'s fixation on the Copenhagen Summit </p><p>in the past few weeks has diverted attention away from this </p><p>case, but we agree with the IMF that the GOT needs to resolve </p><p>it.  We are heartened by the IMF staff\'s firm line on this, </p><p>and will continue to press the new government -- which Fund </p><p>officials believe is starting to become "educated" on the </p><p>issue -- to make clear its strong support for banking reform </p><p>and for the BRSA. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
