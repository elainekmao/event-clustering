<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 17 (3/28 1900 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030328000107 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Embassy Amman went off standfast at 1800 local after </p><p>a mostly quiet day (see below).  The movement of American </p><p>staff remains restricted. The Embassy will remain closed </p><p>March 29 for the regular Jordanian weekend. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Demonstrations were less extensive than anticipated </p><p>in Amman March 28.  Approximately 3,000 demonstrators marched </p><p>downtown following Friday prayers, a lower turnout than </p><p>demonstrations a week ago. GHQ confided to our military that </p><p>they were surprised (and pleasantly so) at the low turnout </p><p>throughout the city. PSD notes the demonstrations were </p><p>largely peaceful, though there was a report of some vandalism </p><p>to a bus, and police reportedly chased and detained several </p><p>demonstrators near the Kaludi mosque for chanting </p><p>anti-government slogans.  Approximately 400-500 rock throwing </p><p>protesters clashed with police in the southern city of Ma\'an, </p><p>but police report that the situation is now calm. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Jordan-Iraq border remains open and staffed on </p><p>the Iraqi side by Iraqi government officials.  IOM reports 17 </p><p>TCN\'s (9 Egyptians and 8 Somalis) arrived overnight March </p><p>27-28.  The total transit camp population hovers around 170. </p><p>IOM plans to repatriate 20-30 TCN\'s March 28 if flights are </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Due to continued light population movements, IOM </p><p>plans to downsize its operations March 28, reducing the </p><p>number of buses at the border to five and pulling its </p><p>expatriate staff out of Aqaba.  IOM said it could quickly </p><p>beef up operations if required. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Recent TCN arrivals report the road from Baghdad </p><p>to the border remains clear. One bridge is reportedly out </p><p>near H1. The current rumor among Baghdad\'s TCN community is </p><p>that it is safer to travel at night.  Consequently, most new </p><p>arrivals appear at the border in the early morning hours. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Medical officials report three cases of TB in the </p><p>transit camp.  The GOJ, WHO, UNHCR, IOM and health care NGO\'s </p><p>in Ruweished are meeting March 28 to develop a management </p><p>plan for the cases.  WHO advises that the infected people </p><p>should not travel until they have "several clean slides," a </p><p>process that could take up to two months.  WHO is also </p><p>concerned about 10 reported diarrhea cases in the camp, which </p><p>it attributes to poor camp layout and management by JRCS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  UNHCR reports that a seemingly destitute </p><p>Palestinian family (elderly man with emphysema, two women, </p><p>and two children) who arrived in no-man\'s land March 27 </p><p>decided early on March 28 to return to Iraq.  UNHCR is "very </p><p>concerned" that the family might have been pressured to </p><p>return. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) With regard to reports of American and Western </p><p>journalists who have "disappeared" from Baghdad in recent </p><p>days (see paras 8-10 of Amman 1869), a local "fixer" working </p><p>for Newsday in Jordan told the Embassy March 28 that she has </p><p>raised the case of the missing journalists with the Iraqi </p><p>Press Attache in Amman, who has "promised to look into it". </p><p>The "fixer" notes that it is possible the bus scheduled to </p><p>deport the journalists to the border on Tuesday may have been </p><p>delayed by heavy duststorms in the region. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
