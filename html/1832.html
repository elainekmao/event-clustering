<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, EB/CBA AND EB/OIA </p><p>COMMERCE ALSO FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SECRETARY EVANS LETTER TO PRESIDENT </p><p>OBASANJO SUPPORTING PROCTER & GAMBLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) USDOC 4307 (B) WALLACE-KAPLAN EMAILS 7/17- </p><p>     7/18/01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Action request, para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Department of Commerce requested Post input on the </p><p>efficacy of sending a Secretarial letter on behalf of Proctor </p><p>& Gamble (P&G) to President Obasanjo.  The Mission believes </p><p>P&G\'s interests would be best served by approaching Chief </p><p>Kolawole Babalola Jamodu, Minister of Industries, who remains </p><p>the primary force behind GON reticence to meet all of P&G\'s </p><p>requests.  President Obasanjo on several occasions has </p><p>expressed displeasure with being drawn into commercial issues </p><p>and has made it clear that, in this case, he will act upon </p><p>the recommendation of his Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Moreover, any message delivered to the GON should explain </p><p>how P&G\'s investment in Nigeria will assist the country to </p><p>revitalize its manufacturing sector.  Nigeria seeks more </p><p>foreign investment, but not at the cost of its existing, </p><p>rather limited manufacturing base.  Unfortunately, P&G\'s </p><p>domestic competition can readily portray a tariff reduction </p><p>on European-manufactured Ariel detergent as an attack on </p><p>domestic Umo-brand detergent production.  P&G\'s Nigerian </p><p>partner reportedly concurs in our view that a letter from </p><p>Secretary Evans to President Obasanjo would not be helpful. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Mission therefore recommends that Secretary Evans send a </p><p>letter instead to his counterpart Minister Jamodu and that </p><p>the letter to President Obasanjo not be delivered.  Mission </p><p>offers a proposed text in para 5, which might serve as the </p><p>basis for a final letter by the Secretary.  Please advise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Begin Text of Letter: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Minister: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I wish to bring to your direct attention an important </p><p>opportunity for Nigeria to raise its profile with potential </p><p>investors in the manufacturing sector.  As you are aware, the </p><p>U.S. firm Procter & Gamble is currently discussing with the </p><p>Nigerian Government a proposal to upgrade its production </p><p>facilities in Ibadan that would generate substantial </p><p>employment in your country.  To make that investment </p><p>financially viable, Procter & Gamble seeks duty reductions on </p><p>certain equipment and raw materials for its proposed </p><p>manufacturing plant, and on one finished product, Ariel </p><p>detergent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the past, Nigerian-made products could be found abundantly </p><p>throughout West and Central Africa.  Proctor & Gamble\'s </p><p>proposal offers an opportunity towards restoration of </p><p>Nigeria\'s regional manufacturing dominance.  The </p><p>liberalization sought would contribute both to creating a </p><p>more competitive marketplace in Nigeria and to expanding </p><p>Nigeria\'s exports to other countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Minister, as you have pointed out many times, attracting </p><p>non-oil investment is vitally important to create meaningful </p><p>employment and diversify the Nigerian economy.  I understand </p><p>your government has already agreed to some of Procter & </p><p>Gamble,s duty reduction proposals.  We would strongly urge </p><p>Nigeria to look favorably on the remaining requests.  These </p><p>changes would benefit ordinary Nigerian citizens by providing </p><p>and expanding the market for high-quality, </p><p>competitively-priced products.  They would also send a </p><p>strong, positive signal to investors that the moment has </p><p>arrived to invest in Nigerian manufacturing.  A robust and </p><p>growing manufacturing sector will position Nigeria to take </p><p>fullest advantage of trade liberalization and of specific </p><p>trade preferences for developing countries, such as the </p><p>African Growth and Opportunity Act. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In closing, I again urge you to look favorably on Procter & </p><p>Gamble,s requests.  This win-win situation would constitute </p><p>a valuable vote of confidence in Nigeria and would be </p><p>interpreted positively by the international business </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p>Donald L. Evans </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text of letter </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
