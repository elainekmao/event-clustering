<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SOFIA 03382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PINR, BU, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ROUND-UP OF BULGARIAN TURKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SOFIA 3356, (B) SOFIA 3170 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EMBOFF CALLED AUGUST 8 ON TAHSIN BURCUOGLU (PROTECT), </p><p>COUNSELOR (AND THIRD RANKING OFFICER) AT THE TURKISH </p><p>EMBASSY IN SOFIA, TO SEEK CONFIRMATION OF AND </p><p>ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON A REPORTED RECENT ROUND-UP AND </p><p>ARREST OF ETHNIC-TURKISH BULGARIANS (REF A).  WITHOUT </p><p>REFERENCE TO REF A REPORT, EMBOFF STEERED DISCUSSION OF </p><p>OTHER TOPICS (SEPTELS) AROUND TO WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT WEEKS REGARDING </p><p>BULGARIAN TURKS.  IN HIS RESPONSE, BURCUOGLU MADE NO </p><p>REFERENCE TO A SUDDEN WAVE OF ARRESTS. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  IN FURTHER CONVERSATION, BURCUOGLU DID REFER TO </p><p>BULGARIAN TURKS RECENTLY RELEASED FROM BELENE ISLAND </p><p>PRISON AND THEN EXILED TO KYUSTENDIL AND VRATSA </p><p>(EVIDENTLY THE CASES ALSO MENTIONED BY SOURCE OF REF A). </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        SOFIA  03382  111320Z </p><p> </p><p>HE SAID THAT NO SPECIFIC TERM OF YEARS FOR SUCH EXILE </p><p>HAD BEEN STATED. IN ENSUING DISCUSSION OF WHETHER BULGARIA </p><p>WAS PURSUING A POLICY OF RESETTLING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS </p><p>OF ETHNIC TURKS, BURCUOGLU INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT </p><p>SUCH FORCED RESETTLEMENTS ON A LIMITED SCALE HAD BEEN </p><p>CARRIED OUT SINCE EVEN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>1984-85 NAME-CHANGING CAMPAIGN.  HE SAID THAT ON A 1985 </p><p>TRIP TO VELIKO TURNOVO, HE WAS TOLD BY ETHNIC TURKISH </p><p>CONTACTS THAT TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES (PROBABLY 800-1000 </p><p>PEOPLE) HAD BEEN UPROOTED FROM THE TURKISH QUARTER OF </p><p>THAT CITY AND RESETTLED ELSEWHERE.  HE HAD BEEN SHOWN </p><p>THE VACANT HOUSES OF SOME OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED. </p><p>HE ALSO REFERRED TO A MORE RECENT CASE OF A YOUNG ETHNIC </p><p>TURK WHO, ALONG WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS, WAS FORCIBLY </p><p>RESETTLED FROM THE PLOVDIV AREA AFTER ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>CONTACT THE TURKISH CONSULATE IN PLOVDIV. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  COMMENT.  THIS EMBASSY\'S DIRECT CONTACT WITH </p><p>ETHNIC TURKS WORKING INVOLUNTARILY OUTSIDE THEIR PLACE </p><p>OF ORIGIN REMAINS LIMITED TO TWO CASES (REF B).  THUS </p><p>ALTHOUGH A POLICY OF RESETTLING ETHNIC TURKS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>"TROUBLE-MAKERS," IS PLAUSIBLE AND WAS INDEED </p><p>THREATENED IN A 1985 INTERVIEW GIVEN BY BULGARIAN </p><p>ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CHAIRMAN ANGEL BALEVSKI, WE CANNOT </p><p>YET CONFIRM THAT SUCH A POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED </p><p>IN MORE THAN POSSIBLY ISOLATED CASES.  A CURRENT SERIES </p><p>OF TRIPS BY EMBOFFS TO "NON-TURKISH" REGIONS OF </p><p>BULGARIA MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO INQUIRE WHETHER </p><p>ANY MOVEMENT OF ETHNIC TURKS HAS OCCURRED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BIO NOTE:  BURCUOGLU APPEARS TO BE IN HIS FORTIES </p><p>AND SPEAKS GOOD, ALTHOUGH OCCASIONALLY LABORED, ENGLISH. </p><p>HE MENTIONED THAT, DURING A PREVIOUS TOUR OF DUTY IN </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  03382  111320Z </p><p> </p><p>IRAN, HE WAS SENT BY HIS AMBASSADOR ("BECAUSE I SPOKE </p><p>SOME FARSI AND AZERI TURKISH") ONTO THE GROUNDS OF THE </p><p>US EMBASSY IN TEHRAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 1979 </p><p>HOSTAGE SEIZURE.  BECAUSE HE WAS SHOUTING "DEATH TO </p><p>AMERICA" AND "ALLAHU AKBAR,"  HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE </p><p>EMBASSY GROUNDS AND WAS NOT HINDERED IN HIS OBSERVATIONS. </p><p>RICKERT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p></p></div>
