<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003149 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 89/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06//12/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, XF, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: BACKGROUND PAPER FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT: MEPP </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE, REASONS E.O. 12958 1.5 </p><p>(B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  BELOW IS DRAFT EMBASSY VATICAN BACKGROUND PAPER </p><p>FOR POSSIBLE VISIT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO THE VATICAN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03149  121501Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE VATICAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>PROCESS HAS EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST THREE </p><p>YEARS.  FOR MANY YEARS, THE VATICAN CALLED FOR THE </p><p>"INTERNATIONALIZATION" OF JERUSALEM, BUT IN THE LATE \'90\'S </p><p>THE POSITION CHANGED TO THE "INTERNATIONALIZATION" OF </p><p>JERUSALEM "INTRAMURA" (WITHIN THE WALLS).  MOST RECENTLY, </p><p>ON THE ISSUE OF JERUSALEM THE VATICAN MOVED SUBSTANTIALLY </p><p>IN A DIRECTION WHICH CAN BE SEEN AS CONSTRUCTIVE.  IT HAS </p><p>DROPPED THE CALL FOR INTERNATIONALIZING ANY PART OF </p><p>JERUSALEM AND IS NOW ASKING THAT THE SHRINES OF THE THREE </p><p>RELIGIONS PRESERVE THEIR UNIQUE AND SACRED CHARACTER </p><p>THROUGH "INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES", IN SUCH A WAY THAT IN </p><p>THE FUTURE "NONE OF THE PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM FOR </p><p>ITSELF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THESE SACRED PARTS OF THE </p><p>CITY".  SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CITY WOULD BE A MATTER FOR THE </p><p>ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO NEGOTIATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DESPITE A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE STAND ON THE FUTURE OF </p><p>JERUSALEM, THE VATICAN\'S TILT TOWARD THE PALESTINIAN SIDE </p><p>OF THE CONFLICT HAS BEEN MORE EVIDENT IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>MOST RECENT VIOLENCE.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE </p><p>EXPLANATIONS TO THE INCREASE IN OVERT SYMPATHY FOR THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE.  IT REFLECTS IN LARGE PART THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>NEED TO MIND THE INTERESTS OF THE PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS. </p><p>ONE OF THE VATICAN\'S WORST FEARS IS A JERUSALEM DEVOID OF </p><p>CHRISTIANS.  THE VATICAN HAS BEEN ALSO TELLING EMBASSY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03149  121501Z </p><p>VATICAN THAT IT BELIEVES IT NEEDS TO SHORE UP YASSIR </p><p>ARAFAT, AS IT IS CONCERNED WITH WHAT DIRECTION THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT WILL TAKE AFTER ARAFAT LEAVES THE </p><p>SCENE (I.E. ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM).  THE PERCEIVED TILT </p><p>MAY ALSO REFLECT RESIDUAL ANTI-SEMITIC ATTITUDES THAT STILL </p><p>EXIST AMONG SOME WITHIN THE VATICAN.  FINALLY, IT COULD </p><p>ALSO BE THE RESULT OF POLITICAL MANEUVERING BY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SODANO AS HE ORGANIZES HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE </p><p>PAPACY.  A PRO-PALESTINIAN STANCE IS POPULAR AMONG </p><p>CARDINALS FROM THE THIRD WORLD. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA03149 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
