<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 003086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, PINS, PGOV, ETRD, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIFE ALONG ROUTE ONE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 2964 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03086  01 OF 02  260643Z </p><p>-     B.  HANOI 2963 </p><p>-     C.  HANOI 2949 </p><p>-     D.  HANOI 2885 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  ROUTE ONE IS BEAUTIFUL DRIVE BUT A </p><p>SURPRISINGLY POOR NATIONAL ARTERY LINKING THE VARIOUS </p><p>REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  THERE IS LITTLE INDICATION OF MUCH </p><p>USE OF LAND OR RAIL TRANSPORT FOR INTER-PROVINCIAL TRADE. </p><p>SMALL-SCALE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SEEMS TO THRIVE.  RICE IS </p><p>CLEARLY KING AMONG AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.  APART FROM SOME </p><p>RANCOR AGAINST THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT, PEOPLE </p><p>UNIFORMLY SEEMED BULLISH ON THE US-VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP AND </p><p>READY TO PUT THE WAR HISTORY BEHIND US.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  NATIONAL HIGHWAY ROUTE ONE IS THE ARTERY LINKING </p><p>VIETNAM\'S THREE MAJOR REGIONS, STRETCHING FROM CA MAU </p><p>PROVINCE ON THE GULF OF THAILAND TO LANG SON PROVINCE ALONG </p><p>THE CHINESE BORDER.  MOST OF ITS LENGTH SKIMS VIETNAM\'S </p><p>DESERVEDLY FAMOUS COASTLINE, OFFERING SPECTACULAR VIEW AFTER </p><p>SPECTACULAR VIEW.  TRAVELERS -- E.G., POL/C AND POL FSN </p><p>DURING THEIR OCTOBER 25-NOVEMBER 2 TRIP BETWEEN HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY AND HANOI -- SOON GROW FATIGUED BY THE CONSTANT </p><p>REPETITION OF "HOW BEAUTIFUL." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  NO OTHER ROADS NOW LINK THE COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH WORK </p><p>IS UNDERWAY ON TRANSFORMING PARTS OF THE ONE-TIME HO CHI </p><p>MINH TRAIL INTO ANOTHER HIGHWAY.  TWENTY-SIX YEARS AFTER </p><p>"LIBERATION" OF THE SOUTH AND NATIONAL "REUNIFICATION," ONE </p><p>MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED THAT THIS NATIONAL HIGHWAY HAD RECEIVED </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LARGESSE OVER THE YEARS TO FACILITATE </p><p>INTER-REGIONAL AND INTER-PROVINCIAL COMMUNICATION.  MAYBE IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03086  01 OF 02  260643Z </p><p>HAS HAD, BUT IF SO, THE RESULTS ARE DISAPPOINTING.  A FEW </p><p>MILES NORTH OF HO CHI MINH CITY, THE HIGHWAY TURNS INTO A </p><p>TWO LANE ROAD, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WITHOUT CENTER OR SIDE </p><p>MARKINGS.  IN MANY SPOTS FROM NINH THUAN ALL THE WAY THROUGH </p><p>TO QUANG BINH PROVINCE, FLOODS HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL EVEN ON </p><p>THIS BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  (IN LATE OCTOBER, TRAFFIC ON </p><p>ROUTE ONE WAS SHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER AT TAM KY IN QUANG NAM </p><p>FOR MORE THAN A DAY DUE TO HIGH WATERS.)  THE RESULT IS THAT </p><p>STRETCHES OF THIS NATIONAL ROUTE ARE LITTLE MORE THAN DIRT </p><p>OR MUDDY PATCHES.  CONCERTED EFFORTS SEEM TO BE UNDERWAY TO </p><p>IMPROVE BRIDGES, ESPECIALLY SMALL ONES OVER DIKES AND </p><p>CREEKS, BUT IN THE MEANTIME ONGOING CONSTRUCTION OFTEN MEANS </p><p>ONE-WAY TRAFFIC. (NOTE:  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, </p><p>JAPANESE OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND/OR LOANS, WORTH </p><p>WELL OVER USD 130 MILLION, ARE FUNDING THE WORK ON 71 </p><p>BRIDGES OVER SEVERAL YEARS. END NOTE)  ONCE ACROSS THE </p><p>FORMER DMZ, IN QUANG BINH PROVINCE, HOWEVER, THE ROAD </p><p>BECOMES DRAMATICALLY BETTER PAVED AND MAINTAINED, ALTHOUGH </p><p>IT CONTINUES TO BE TWO LANES FOR MOST OF THE REMAINING </p><p>JOURNEY INTO HANOI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  TRAFFIC IS REMARKABLY LIGHT, WITH RELATIVELY FEW </p><p>TRANSPORT TRUCKS.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO FOR MILES AT A TIME </p><p>WITHOUT PASSING ANOTHER SEDAN OR TRUCK, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A </p><p>STEADY FLOOD OF MOTORCYCLES AND BICYCLES AS WELL AS THE </p><p>OCCASIONAL CATTLE- OR HORSE-DRAWN CART.  FLOODS OF PRIMARY </p><p>SCHOOLCHILDREN HEADING HOME ON FOOT OR BICYCLE AFTER THEIR </p><p>HALF-DAY SESSIONS COMPOSE ONE OF THE FEW PERSISTENT "TRAFFIC </p><p>JAMS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO ASSUME THAT MUCH FREIGHT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03086  01 OF 02  260643Z </p><p>MUST BE GOING BY TRAIN FROM THE TWO ENDS OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p>THE SOLE MAJOR NORTH-SOUTH RAILWAY LINE RUNS PRETTY MUCH IN </p><p>TANDEM WITH ROUTE ONE, CRISS-CROSSING REGULARLY AND OFTEN </p><p>WITHIN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER.  TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY MUST </p><p>COME TO A HALT AT MANY CROSSINGS, WHERE THERE ARE ALWAYS A </p><p>SMALL BEVY OF PETTY MERCHANTS WITH LIFE\'S DAILY NECESSITIES </p><p>-- CANDIES, CIGARETTES, FRUIT, ETC.  IN EIGHT DAYS OF </p><p>TRAVEL, WE SAW NO MORE THAN 3-4 TRAINS A DAY, VIRTUALLY ALL </p><p>OF THEM PASSENGER TRAINS.  EITHER INTER-PROVINCIAL TRADE IS </p><p>EXTREMELY LIMITED, OR MUCH OF IT IS GOING BY BOAT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  SIGNS OF A VITAL IF LARGELY SMALL-SCALE PRIVATE </p><p>SERVICE SECTOR ARE EVERYWHERE.  DUSTY ROADSIDE RESTAURANTS </p><p>POSITION EMPLOYEES IN THE STREET TO WAVE IN WOULD-BE </p><p>CUSTOMERS WITH THEIR HANDS AND SMILES.  BEACHSIDE BEER HALLS </p><p>DO A BOOMING BUSINESS, AS DO UBIQUITOUS COFFEE/TEA </p><p>RESTAURANTS, SOME OF THEM QUITE ELABORATE.  AN ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>LEISURE CLASS CLEARLY EXISTS ALONG ROUTE ONE, ALTHOUGH THEY </p><p>SEEM TO HEAD HOME FAIRLY EARLY.  EVEN NHA TRANG\'S HOPPING </p><p>DISCO SCENE APPARENTLY CLOSES DOWN AROUND MIDNIGHT.  NOT TO </p><p>WORRY, THOUGH:  AMOROUS COUPLES CAN STILL HEAD TO THE </p><p>BEACHES AFTER HOURS.  OTHER BEACH-SIDE HUTS EVEN IN A </p><p>BACKWATER RESORT LIKE NHAT LE (QUANG BINH PROVINCE) </p><p>APPARENTLY OFFER MORE THAN SEAFOOD SNACKS.  THEIR YOUNG AND </p><p>HEAVILY MADE-UP FEMALE STAFF GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF </p><p>BECOMING MORE AND MORE FRIENDLY AS THE DAY WORE ON (WE ONLY </p><p>STOPPED FOR LUNCH, WHICH SEEMED TO THROW THEM INTO A GOOD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03086  02 OF 02  260644Z </p><p>DEAL OF CONFUSION:  "SOMEONE ACTUALLY WANTS TO EAT HERE?"). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  APART FROM A FEW STRETCHES OF RUBBER PLANTATIONS, </p><p>THE UTTER DOMINANCE OF RICE CULTURE WAS STRIKING, ALBEIT </p><p>WITH CONSIDERABLE VARIATION ON MATURITY AND FERTILITY AMONG </p><p>THE REGIONS.  THE FARTHER SOUTH, THE MORE IMPRESSIVE.  SANDY </p><p>STRETCHES IN PHU YEN AND BINH DINH WERE MORE BLEAK, IN </p><p>PLACES WITH EXTENSIVE SALT FIELDS.  HA TINH, NGHE AN AND </p><p>THANH HOA IN THE NORTH WERE AGAIN RELATIVELY MORE </p><p>PROSPEROUS, WITH SOMEWHAT MORE VARIETY OF CROPS EVIDENT. </p><p>HOUSING STANDARDS FOLLOWED THESE GENERAL PATTERNS.  HOUSES </p><p>IN THE VARIOUS SOUTHERN PROVINCES OFTEN SPORTED THE DATE OF </p><p>CONSTRUCTION, WITH A SURPRISING NUMBER HAVING BEEN BUILT IN </p><p>THE 1970\'S, BOTH PRE- AND POST-1975.  RELATIVELY FEW SEEM TO </p><p>HAVE GONE UP IN THE 1980\'S, WITH ANOTHER SURGE IN THE </p><p>1990\'S.  FOR FARMHOUSES, THERE WAS LITTLE TO DISTINGUISH </p><p>THOSE FROM THIRTY YEARS AGO FROM MORE RECENT ONES, BUT EVEN </p><p>VILLAGES AND TOWNS TYPICALLY HAD AT LEAST A COUPLE OF </p><p>VIRTUAL MANSIONS IN THE TYPICAL TALL AND THIN FASHION </p><p>FAVORED IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN ACCENT REMAIN SHARP, WITH </p><p>ACCENTS IN CENTRAL PROVINCES LIKE QUANG NAM AND QUANG TRI, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE MORE SOPHISTICATED CITY OF DANANG, DISTINCT </p><p>CHALLENGES AT LEAST FOR ONE FSI-TRAINED DIPLOMAT.  NATIONAL </p><p>EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, AND STATE-RUN TELEVISION AND RADIO </p><p>BROADCASTS APPEAR TO HAVE DONE LITTLE TO DISPEL SUCH </p><p>REGIONAL VARIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  WHILE THE ISSUE OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT </p><p>INEVITABLY CAME UP DURING OFFICIAL MEETINGS (REF A), ALONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03086  02 OF 02  260644Z </p><p>WITH OCCASIONAL COMPLAINTS FROM OFFICIALS IN PROVINCES </p><p>NEAREST THE OLD DMZ ABOUT DOUBLE-STANDARD LECTURES FROM THE </p><p>U.S. ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS DESPITE DAMAGE CAUSED </p><p>DURING THE WAR, ANECDOTAL IMPRESSIONS AND UNSCIENTIFIC </p><p>SOUNDINGS WITH OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL INTERLOCUTORS ALIKE </p><p>INDICATED AN ALMOST ACROSS-THE-BOARD INTEREST IN THE U.S., </p><p>FAVORABLE DISPOSITION TOWARD THE U.S., AND GENUINE EAGERNESS </p><p>TO SEE THE US-VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP MOVE FORWARD.  A GUIDE IN </p><p>A QUANG TRI WAR MEMORIAL -- ON A HISTORICAL SITE WHERE IT </p><p>WAS ALLEGED THAT THE US BOMBS DROPPED THERE HAD SEVEN TIMES </p><p>THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF THE ATOMIC BOMB ON HIROSHIMA -- </p><p>WENT THROUGH HIS RATHER HORRIFIC SPIEL WITH A STRAIGHT FACE </p><p>AND CALM DEMEANOR.  WHEN ASKED SUBSEQUENTLY IF HE OR OTHER </p><p>LOCAL PEOPLE REMAINED ANGRY AT THE U.S. OR RESENTED THE </p><p>CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF BILATERAL TIES, HE SMILED AND </p><p>ANSWERED "NO, THAT\'S ALL IN THE PAST.  NO ONE WANTS TO THINK </p><p>ABOUT THAT ANY MORE."  IT\'S NOT A BAD SUMMARY OF POPULAR </p><p>ATTITUDES ALONG ROUTE ONE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
