<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/EAMED </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR BERNSTEIN, SILLS AND PORTER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: EC REG 1774/2002: CANADA SEEKS DELAY IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 57391 </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada is concerned about the difficulty of implementing </p><p>EC Regulation 1774/2002 on May 1 and, following receipt of </p><p>Reftel demarche, sent a letter to the EC requesting a delay </p><p>in implementation of the regulation concerning animal </p><p>by-products.  According to the Department of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and International Trade (DFAIT) Trade Policy Officer Sudha </p><p>Kshatriya, Canada\'s Deputy Head of Mission in Brussels </p><p>Laurette Glasgow sent the letter to the EC\'s Director General </p><p>for Trade Peter Carl on Thursday, March 13.  Kshatriya said </p><p>that she has been in direct contact with USTR\'s Jason </p><p>Bernstein and has provided him with a copy of the letter. </p><p> </p><p>2. In Fall 2002 Canada raised their concerns about the </p><p>Regulation bilaterally with the European Commission, during </p><p>the November SPS committee meeting, and in a letter from </p><p>Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief to EC Consumer </p><p>Health and Safety Commissioner Byrne.  Kshatriya stated that </p><p>the GOC has come to realize that the representations were not </p><p>successful and that implementation of 1774/2002 was "a done </p><p>deal."  Canada is now focusing on developing an industry </p><p>implementation plan and has been in contact with the EC to </p><p>seek clarification on the complex regulations.  Kshatriya </p><p>noted that the GOC has been working with the US Animal and </p><p>Plant Health Inspection Service on technical issues related </p><p>to the implementation of the regulations.  Canada has not </p><p>received any derogations from the EC. </p><p> </p><p>3. DFAIT is coordinating an interagency response to Reftel </p><p>demarche, which we will pass along.  Reftel talking points </p><p>were also delivered to Richard Fadden and Paul Haddow from </p><p>the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
