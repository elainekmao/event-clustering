(SBU) In a June 11 meeting with Econ Counselor, </p><p>Ambassador Ahmet Okcun, MFA Coordinator for Afghanistan </p><p>and Iraq, conveyed a GOT plan to fund construction of </p><p>and equipment for 2 hospitals in Baghdad and Kirkuk, </p><p>based on an assessment done by the Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>(TRC) in a recent visit to Iraq.  However, this would </p><p>not be a TRC project, but a Turkish Government project. </p><p>Okcun stated that the GOT already has the funds </p><p>allocated for this and the blueprints for construction. </p><p>Okcun stated that, for budgetary and other internal </p><p>reasons, the GOT would need to sign an MOU on these </p><p>projects, and asked that the USG advise which entity in </p><p>Iraq would be the  appropriate counterpart for such an </p><p>MOU.  He suggested the GOT would be pleased to work sign </p><p>an MOU with the Iraqi Red Crescent, which already has </p><p>identified a plot of land in Baghdad for one hospital. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In a separate meeting the following day with </p><p>Mission Disaster Relief Officer, TRC Director General </p><p>Fatih Evren raised the Turkish offer on hospitals for </p><p>Iraq, but emphasized that MFA had the lead in </p><p>coordinating with the USG on this issue.  MDRO </p><p>encouraged TRC to coordinate aid activities with the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent, </p><p>and asked whether TRC had done so on this offer.  Evren </p><p>stated that TRC preferred to work with U.S. authorities </p><p>or with the Iraqi Red Crescent on aid, claiming that </p><p>ICRC was not forthcoming in responding to offers of </p><p>assistance from national societies outside Iraq.  MDRO </p><p>suggested to Evren that TRC and/or MFA make a written </p><p>proposal on hospitals, which the Embassy could share </p><p>with appropriate Washington and Coalition Provisional </p><p>Authority staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Action Request:  Embassy would appreciate </p><p>Department/OCPA\'s thoughts on the MFA\'s proposal, as </p><p>well as guidance on the appropriate authorities in Iraq </p><p>with which the MFA should pursue this.. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
