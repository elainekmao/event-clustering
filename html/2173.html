"WHAT IS IT THAT ZIMBABWE HAS WHICH NECESSITATES THE </p><p>   PASSING OF A LAW BY A SUPER POWER, ATTRACTS THE </p><p>   ATTENTION OF A GROUPING OF RELATIVELY WELL-OFF EUROPEAN </p><p>   COUNTRIES AND MAKES ITS FORMER COLONIZER WANT TO SPONSOR </p><p>   AN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTY. . .?

IF THERE WERE NO WHITES IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>   WOULD THE U.S., AUSTRALIA AND CANADA DEAL WITH US WITH </p><p>   THE SAME ZEAL AS THEY ARE DISPLAYING NOW?
