<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/FO FOR DAS PERRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, ECON, SENV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEED TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT FY-02 ESF PROPOSALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 ABUJA 3162 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This cable provides additional justification for </p><p>two of the FY-02 ESF proposals submitted reftel. The </p><p>following justifications are in order of Mission </p><p>priority. Complete project descriptions will be faxed </p><p>to AF/W. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP AGRIBUSINESS </p><p>IN THE NORTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Project Overview and USG Interests </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. We need creative projects that directly address key </p><p>American interests and concerns in Nigeria. This </p><p>project fits that description by advancing important </p><p>goals of Economic Growth, Democratization and </p><p>Combating Terrorism, three of the Mission\'s key </p><p>performance goals under the latest MPP. Northern </p><p>Nigeria needs greater USG penetration, diplomatically </p><p>as well as by our economic assistance. Nigeria is home </p><p>to Africa\'s largest Muslim population, and most </p><p>Nigerian Muslims live in the North. The project will </p><p>be an important symbol that the USG regards Nigeria\'s </p><p>Muslims as its friends and partners. Our diplomatic </p><p>efforts to engage Nigeria\'s Muslim community will fall </p><p>on deaf ears if not accompanied by demonstrations of </p><p>targeted assistance that have a visible impact. Again, </p><p>this project fits the bill nicely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Kano is a key state economically and politically </p><p>and Jigawa is a recently created state, formerly part </p><p>of Kano.  Kano\'s capital, which bears the same name as </p><p>the State, is the North\'s largest city. Unfortunately, </p><p>both the city and state have experienced significant </p><p>unemployment and economic dislocations in recent years </p><p>due to declining agricultural production and the </p><p>impact of global economic competition on local </p><p>industries, particularly textiles and leatherwork. Due </p><p>to the high levels of unemployment and poverty, Kano </p><p>has experienced severe disruptions in the recent past. </p><p>Because of economic want, the local population is </p><p>restive and Kano is a potential home for Islamic </p><p>radicalism and divisive political regionalism. </p><p>Organizations from Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, </p><p>Pakistan and Libya have established themselves in Kano </p><p>and elsewhere in the North.  Not only do these groups </p><p>provide Islamic education, many also promote anti- </p><p>American sentiment. This project will help counter </p><p>their presence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. By putting people to work and energizing the </p><p>agricultural sector, the project will be a catalyst in </p><p>the local economy. Not only is agriculture the </p><p>dominant economic sector in the North, every new job </p><p>created helps support 5-10 other people. Thus, job </p><p>creation under this project will have a ripple effect, </p><p>spurring growth beyond the activities directly related </p><p>to the project. Additionally, the more people are </p><p>gainfully employed, the less likely they are prone to </p><p>social unrest and extremism of any form. The project </p><p>promotes the order and stability necessary for </p><p>sustaining democracy. This is exceedingly important as </p><p>Nigeria moves to state and national elections in 2003. </p><p>Key project objectives are to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Create a private/public partnership to develop a </p><p>strong agro-business base and leverage $6 million in </p><p>private sector investment; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Focus on existing crops with a strong agro- </p><p>industrial potential and development of a sustainable </p><p>local seed industry; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Counter the deforestation that degrades water </p><p>quality and encourages erosion; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Introduce several high-value industrial tree crops </p><p>with strong global market demand; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Create a minimum of 5,000 jobs in agribusiness, </p><p>particularly among rural youth, with a program for </p><p>continued job creation for the coming decade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Agro-industry in Northern Nigeria is in its </p><p>infancy and not currently managed well. Bolstering </p><p>agro-industry in the region, this initiative will </p><p>focus on cotton for domestic use as well as tomatoes </p><p>and other horticultural products for domestic use and </p><p>export to the European Union and Middle East using the </p><p>cargo facilities at Kano\'s International Airport. </p><p>Locally grown cotton can be processed for the domestic </p><p>textile industry, providing a basis for taking </p><p>advantage of AGOA in the future.  Cotton by-products </p><p>can be used for animal feed and oil for various </p><p>industrial end-uses.  High value tree crops with </p><p>strong global markets include the (1) Karite tree\'s </p><p>shay nuts used by the cosmetics and soap industries; </p><p>(2) Tee Tree (melaleuca spp.) oil marketed as a </p><p>natural antiseptic and antifungal agent; (3) Gum </p><p>Arabic derived from the Acacia Tree, used as an </p><p>emulsifier; and (4) Neem Tree Oil, used by the </p><p>furniture/wood industry. Making tree crops more </p><p>valuable should reduce cutting for firewood, a </p><p>principal cause of deforestation in the Guinea </p><p>Savannah and Sahel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Project Partners: Implementing this project, </p><p>USAID\'s primary partners will be Schaffer and </p><p>Associates (SAIL), Dangote Industries, Ltd. (DIL), </p><p>AfricaGlobal (AFG), and Michigan State University </p><p>(MSU).  These partners will work with reputable local </p><p>firms, State Governments, NGOs, CBOs (for out </p><p>growers), and the Federal Government, to develop new </p><p>private sector investment opportunities in agro- </p><p>business and to create jobs. SAIL and MSU will have </p><p>primary responsibility for all trials and training. </p><p>SAIL and DIL, working with the local states, will </p><p>focus on developing cotton, tomatoes and other </p><p>horticultural products as agro-industrial crops. They </p><p>will also explore the creation of a local private seed </p><p>industry. Depending on how these develop, SAIL and DIL </p><p>will assess exploitation of high value tree crops. </p><p>SAIL/AFG will have primary responsibility for </p><p>structuring new investment in agribusiness, working </p><p>with DIL and other potential investors. MSU will work </p><p>with AFG to develop a youth training/employment </p><p>component for each crop. USAID will have overall </p><p>responsibility for project implementation through a </p><p>Cooperative Agreement with MSU through the </p><p>Partnerships for Food Industry Development or similar </p><p>mechanism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Project Outputs: Within 2 years, the project will </p><p>have: (1) created at least ten new agribusiness </p><p>investment opportunities; (2) trained/mentored at </p><p>1,000 youth for agro-business related jobs; (3) </p><p>leveraged $6 million in new agribusiness investment; </p><p>and (4) created 5,000 new jobs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  CREATING A RESPONSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRY </p><p>(THE NIGER DELTA - SOUTH) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Project Overview and USG Interests </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. This project advances the Mission Goals of Economic </p><p>Growth and Democracy. The Niger Delta is economically </p><p>important to the United States. Nigeria furnishes </p><p>approximately 8 percent of U.S. oil imports and the </p><p>nearly all Nigeria\'s production comes from the Delta. </p><p>The region also is blessed with major natural gas </p><p>reserves and large-scale gas extraction is imminent. </p><p>As with oil, American companies will likely be major </p><p>players, and Nigeria can become an important source of </p><p>natural gas for the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. However, despite the wealth generated by the </p><p>extractive industries, the Delta remains an </p><p>economically depressed, environmentally challenged and </p><p>politically troubled region.  There is significant </p><p>discontent among residents that both their government </p><p>and the oil companies have paid inadequate attention </p><p>to their basic needs. Residents believe the local </p><p>ecological system has been tossed off-balance by the </p><p>extractive activities yet they have not been </p><p>compensated for this adverse by-product of the oil </p><p>industry, notwithstanding considerable resources from </p><p>the oil companies for mitigation of environmental </p><p>impact and investments in social infrastructure. For </p><p>example, water contamination and improper waste </p><p>management have contributed to a diminution of </p><p>traditional means of livelihood (agriculture and </p><p>fishing) but there also has been very little modern </p><p>development (schools, roads, health clinics </p><p>industries) in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Because of this adverse combination, the Delta has </p><p>seen more than its share of social unrest. </p><p>Frequently, this discontent is focused against the oil </p><p>companies.  Protests and facility takeovers have </p><p>disrupted operations and put personnel in harm\'s way. </p><p>There is a history of kidnappings of oil company </p><p>personnel.  These types of disturbances can </p><p>potentially disrupt an important source of oil for the </p><p>U.S.  Because oil revenues constitute the vast </p><p>majority of Nigeria\'s national income, any major </p><p>unrest and sustained disruption of production could </p><p>hinder economic stability and growth in Nigeria. </p><p>Additionally, the competition for scarce local </p><p>resources by the Delta\'s inhabitants has led to </p><p>persistent inter-ethnic clashes.  These clashes </p><p>undermine political stability and democratization. </p><p>Last, although the U.S. oil companies in the Delta are </p><p>private sector operations, they represent the United </p><p>States to local residents. The extent we work with the </p><p>local populace, government and the oil companies to </p><p>address environmental and developmental concerns, the </p><p>better will be our relationship and the greater our </p><p>influence here.  Key project objectives are to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Build a quality local private sector environmental </p><p>services industry to more adequately address major </p><p>environmental needs in the Delta; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Develop a center of excellence at Port Harcourt </p><p>University\'s Institute of Environmental Studies to </p><p>provide entrepreneurial and skills training to </p><p>strengthen and expanded the private sector </p><p>environmental services industry; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Create a youth employment and training program for </p><p>the local private sector environmental services </p><p>industry; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Urge private sector energy companies such as Shell, </p><p>ExxonMobil, Chevron and others to contract with local </p><p>private sector environmental firms assisted through </p><p>this project; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Create a minimum of 1,000 jobs in the local </p><p>environmental services industry within two years, with </p><p>a program for continued job creation each year for the </p><p>coming decade; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Assist selected communities in the Delta to manage </p><p>more efficiently the resources received from the GON </p><p>and oil companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  This project will help fill a serious gap -- the </p><p>existing private/public sector capacity for </p><p>environmental services in the Delta is inadequate. As </p><p>a result, the environmental needs of the region cannot </p><p>be sufficiently addressed by in-country resources. </p><p>Environmental issues in the Delta typically include </p><p>poor potable water quality/capacity, untreated or </p><p>under-treated wastewater, lack of appropriate solid </p><p>and medical waste management, contamination from oil </p><p>and the related energy industry and natural resource </p><p>depletion. These issues have a direct linkage to </p><p>regional health and economic problems. The lack of </p><p>adequate environmental services further compounds </p><p>other development gaps such as poor roads and </p><p>inadequate health services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Implementing Consortium: Millennium Science </p><p>Engineering is a premier U.S. environmental services </p><p>group with relevant global experience, including </p><p>Africa. In addition to training local firms, they will </p><p>help improve Port Harcourt University\'s Institute of </p><p>Environmental Studies. AfricaGlobal has worked a </p><p>number of years in the Delta, including with state </p><p>governments, Port Harcourt University and oil </p><p>companies. AfricaGlobal will ensure participation by </p><p>all local stakeholders and help manage aspects of the </p><p>project, including youth employment. Fresh and Green, </p><p>a locally registered environmental services firm, will </p><p>assist with training local firms, and with youth </p><p>training and employment. Port Harcourt University will </p><p>provide the venue and facilities for all local </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Project Outputs: Within 2 years, the project will </p><p>have: (a) created a center of excellence at the </p><p>University of Port Harcourt; (b) trained/mentored at </p><p>least 20 local environmental services firms and more </p><p>than 100 youths; (c) assisted at least ten firms to </p><p>win contracts with oil companies and the public sector </p><p>to deliver environmental services; (d) created 1,000 </p><p>new jobs; and (e) improved financial management in 6 </p><p>to 10 LGAs in the Delta. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
