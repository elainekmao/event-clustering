<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 001055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) IO/T </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AORC, TBIO, VT, UNGA, KSIA </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FULL CLONING BAN, </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO COORDINATE ON UN CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 51552 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  PER DEPARTMENT\'S REQUEST (REF A), DCM AND POLOFF REVIEWED </p><p>THE U.S. APPROACH TO ACHIEVING AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION TO </p><p>BAN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING WITH NEW VATICAN DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO PAROLIN.  PAROLIN, WHO WAS FULLY </p><p>CONVERSANT WITH THE STATE OF PLAY ON THE CONVENTION, ASSURED </p><p>US THAT THE HOLY SEE REMAINED FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING </p><p>WITH US TO ACHIEVE A GLOBAL BAN ON ALL FORMS OF HUMAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01055  140925Z </p><p>CLONING.  DCM EMPHASIZED THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR A COMPLETE BAN, AND REITERATED THE FIRM U.S. OPPOSITION </p><p>TO A PARTIAL BAN.  REFLECTING THE BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT </p><p>AMONG KEY COUNTRIES, PAROLIN EXPRESSED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE APPROACHING KEY UNDECIDED COUNTRIES </p><p>TO BUILD FURTHER SUPPORT PRIOR TO THE FINAL DECISION ON A </p><p>MANDATE FOR THE UN CLONING CONVENTION.  HE AGREED TO DO SO </p><p>BOTH AT THE UN (VIA PERMANENT OBSERVER ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE) </p><p>AND IN CAPITALS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  RECOGNIZING OUR VIEW OF THE HOLY SEE AS A KEY ALLY IN </p><p>ACHIEVING A COMPLETE BAN, DCM EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF AN </p><p>UNBENDING HOLY SEE POSITION IN FAVOR OF A COMPLETE BAN.  WE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT ANY SIGNAL OF HOLY SEE FLEXIBILITY TOWARD A </p><p>TWO-STEP APPROACH COULD OFFER WAVERING GOVERNMENTS MORAL </p><p>COVER FOR A POSITION IN FAVOR OF THE FRENCH-GERMAN TWO-STEP </p><p>APPROACH.  WHILE REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR A COMPLETE BAN, </p><p>PAROLIN REITERATED THE POSITION,  PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED BY </p><p>ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE (REF B), THAT IF IT APPEARED THE PUSH FOR </p><p>A COMPLETE BAN WAS LEADING TO NO AGREEMENT AT ALL, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WOULD SUPPORT A TWO-STEP PROCESS SUCH AS THE </p><p>FRENCH-GERMAN PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD REGARD </p><p>THIS AS "THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS." AT THE SAME TIME, HE SAID </p><p>THE HOLY SEE WOULD INSIST ON LOCKING IN THE PRINCIPAL THAT NO </p><p>FORM OF CLONING WAS ACCEPTABLE, AND THAT WORK ON A </p><p>THERAPEUTIC BAN WOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW ACHIEVEMENT OF THE </p><p>REPRODUCTIVE BAN.  DCM POINTED OUT THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS </p><p>IN FRANCE AND GERMANY TO BAN CLONING COULD AFFECT THE </p><p>POSITION THESE COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY PUT FORWARD. </p><p>PAROLIN DEMONSTRATED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THESE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AND AGREED THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGING. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01055  140925Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT:  PAROLIN\'S CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS OF </p><p>THE CLONING ISSUE AND HIS AFFIRMATION THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>GOAL REMAINS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLE </p><p>THAT HUMAN CLONING IN ANY FORM WAS UNACCEPTABLE SUGGEST THAT </p><p>HE WILL BE A STRONG ALLY IN OUR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION BANNING ALL FORMS OF CLONING. </p><p>PAROLIN APPEARED PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN OUR TALLY OF </p><p>COUNTRIES MAKING UP THE THREE STREAMS OF THOUGHT ON A </p><p>CONVENTION, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>KEY COUNTRIES.  EMBASSY RECOMMENDS THE DEPARTMENT AND USUN </p><p>KEEP THE HOLY SEE UP TO DATE ON SUPPORT FOR THE FULL BAN AND </p><p>ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL SHIFTS IN KEY COUNTRIES SO THEY CAN </p><p>TARGET THEIR ADVOCACY MOST EFFECTIVELY ON COUNTRIES IN LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, AFRICA AND ASIA WHERE THE HOLY SEE CAN BEST BRING </p><p>ITS INFLUENCE TO BEAR. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01055 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
