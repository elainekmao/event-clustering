<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000630 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR USTR RWHITKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, EAID, EAGR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GUM ARABIC SUCCESS STORY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Ambassador Jeter and AUSTR Whitaker visited </p><p>Jigawa and Kano states on January 28 and 29 respectively. Two </p><p>years of negotiations, involving the U.S. private sector, </p><p>Nigerian State and Federal Governments, USTR and the U.S. </p><p>Embassy resulted in the January 28 launching of the Gum </p><p>Arabic Initiative, and the sale of the facility,s entire </p><p>2002 annual production to Coca Cola and other U.S. corporate </p><p>consumers.  The Gum Arabic Initiative, jointly funded by </p><p>USAID and Coca-Cola, established a quality control laboratory </p><p>in Jigawa and will train farmers on quality control.  By </p><p>producing an unadulterated product of certifiable quality, </p><p>the Initiative will help Nigerian gum arabic exports to the </p><p>U.S. grow from virtually zero to encompass the entire crop of </p><p>Jigawa and much of the superior grade-1 produce from </p><p>surrounding states, creating at least 600 new jobs.  Niger </p><p>Republic will also be an indirect beneficiary.  Gum arabic is </p><p>the first totally new public-private business opportunity </p><p>created since Nigeria,s 1999 return to civilian government, </p><p>and it offers economic development to one of the nation,s </p><p>poorest areas.  In northern Nigeria,s commercial center of </p><p>Kano, the Ambassador and AUSTR Whitaker met leaders from the </p><p>private sector, State government officials and the powerful </p><p>Emir of Kano to discuss developing other goods for export </p><p>under AGOA.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Gum Arabic Project in Jigawa State </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   On January 28, Ambassador Jeter and AUSTR Rosa Whitaker, </p><p>accompanied by Embassy officers (ECON, USAID), traveled to </p><p>the Maigatari Export Free Zone in Jigawa State to launch the </p><p>Gum Arabic Initiative.  The ceremony was attended by over </p><p>2,000 people, including the governors of Kano, Zamfara, </p><p>Bauchi, Kebbi, and Jigawa States, the Federal Minister of </p><p>Agriculture, Minister of Commerce, traditional rulers from </p><p>Jigawa State, farmers, journalists and private sector </p><p>representatives, including three of the top purchases of gum </p><p>arabic from the United States and officials of Coca-Cola. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. In her speech, AUSTR Whitaker noted that the Gum Arabic </p><p>Initiative represented an important partnership between the </p><p>Jigawa State Government, the USG and U.S. industry.  The </p><p>partnership will continue through USAID-provided training for </p><p>numerous farmers in all gum arabic-producing states on tree </p><p>cultivation, management and harvesting techniques that will </p><p>enable them to produce higher-quality gum.  Coca-Cola and </p><p>USAID together funded the construction of a gum arabic </p><p>quality control laboratory in Maigatari.  The quality control </p><p>laboratory will ensure that Nigerian gum arabic is </p><p>unadulterated and meets required high U.S. standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In his remarks, the Ambassador emphasized that the gum </p><p>arabic initiative was just one step in growing economic </p><p>cooperation between Nigeria and the U.S. aimed at developing </p><p>the agricultural sector.  The gum arabic launching </p><p>represented a significant non-oil economic dividend for </p><p>Nigeria and should help Nigeria establish itself in an </p><p>important niche market in the U.S., he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Presidents of Importers Service Corporation, Atlantic </p><p>Gums, and executives from Coca-Cola represented the U.S. </p><p>private sector.  These three U.S. firms constitute nearly 70 </p><p>percent of U.S. gum arabic imports and consume 50 percent of </p><p>gum arabic exports worldwide.  In an historic move, these </p><p>firms announced their agreement to purchase the entire crop </p><p>(300 metric tons) of high-grade gum arabic from Jigawa State </p><p>this season.  This purchase is expected to generate 600 jobs </p><p>for Jigawa farmers.  Gum arabic farmers from surrounding </p><p>states as well as producers from the Niger Republic also </p><p>stand to benefit as more and more regional production is </p><p>channeled through Jigawa at the testing facility there.  The </p><p>new quality control laboratory has provided the assurance </p><p>needed to change U.S. industry\'s long-standing position of </p><p>not purchasing Nigerian gum arabic in bulk because of the </p><p>high level of adulteration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The gum arabic launching was a tremendous success and was </p><p>favorably featured in all the major media and lauded by many </p><p>Nigerian leaders.  The Minister of Agriculture publicly </p><p>praised the public-private partnership between the U.S. </p><p>Government, U.S. industry and the GON.  He also announced </p><p>that the Ministry of Agriculture would promote the production </p><p>of acacia (gum arabic) seeds and seedlings for distribution </p><p>to farmers at subsidized rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. This success story has encouraged Nigerian Governors and </p><p>farmers who look forward to the expansion of the project to </p><p>other gum producing states, and emulation of this program in </p><p>other agricultural sub-sectors.  In this vein, the Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that the quality control laboratory and U.S. </p><p>support for Nigeria\'s gum arabic exports would not be limited </p><p>to Jigawa State, but expanded to include the entire gum </p><p>arabic producing belt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>The Kano Private Sector: Export of Leather Goods and Fruit? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. On January 28, the Ambassador also hosted a dinner in Kano </p><p>for AUSTR Whitaker to meet members of the Kano Chamber Of </p><p>Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA). </p><p>Introducing Rosa Whitaker as a leader and key implementor of </p><p>AGOA, the Ambassador stressed the meeting would allow the </p><p>Kano Chamber to air concerns or questions regarding AGOA </p><p>benefits.  AUSTR Whitaker explained that AGOA has brought an </p><p>additional USD 1.2 billion in U.S. trade and USD 1 billion in </p><p>U.S. investment to Africa.  Whitaker gave examples of African </p><p>achievements using AGOA, including the creation of 30,000 </p><p>jobs in Madagascar, 50,000 jobs in Kenya, and 66,000 jobs in </p><p>South Africa, with South Africa now a major exporter of </p><p>assembled Mercedes Benz and BMW vehicles.  Moreover, Namibia </p><p>had attracted USD 100 million in the garment manufacturing </p><p>industry, directly tied to AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Whitaker stressed that Nigeria and, in particular, Kano </p><p>State could benefit from AGOA.  She said, for example, that </p><p>Nigeria could become a leading exporter of leather goods, </p><p>noting that Kano has comparative advantage in the production </p><p>of leather.  High tariffs on leather goods originating in </p><p>Taiwan and China would give further advantage to Nigerian </p><p>leather producers.  The Chamber members noted that Nigerian </p><p>leather is presently exported to Italy and Spain, though on a </p><p>small-scale.  Whitaker offered to link the Nigerian leather </p><p>goods industry to prospective buyers in the U.S. once the </p><p>quality is improved and a wholesaler emerges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Chamber members also commented that Nigeria produced </p><p>large amounts of fruit, which eventually spoiled due to poor </p><p>storage and preservation techniques.  Whitaker replied that </p><p>if appropriate preservation techniques were adopted, a large </p><p>market exists in the U.S for fruit and fruit products.  She </p><p>noted that cane and straw products (furniture, baskets etc), </p><p>also were in high demand in the U.S., a market she believed </p><p>Nigeria could capture.  The Chamber members replied that they </p><p>would convey Whitaker,s message to their constituency and </p><p>would define areas where they might need U.S. support. </p><p>Whitaker promised to help find a market for the products and </p><p>assist in ensuring that the products meet the required </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Ambassador Jeter and AUSTR Whitaker also met with key </p><p>players in the Kano public and private agriculture sector. </p><p>During the meeting, USAID and the Kano agriculturists agreed </p><p>to form a committee to discuss on a regular basis USAID </p><p>programs, such as the farmer-to-farmer program, and link </p><p>these programs with AGOA export opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Meeting with Kano State Governor and Emir </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The Ambassador and Whitaker met January 29 with the </p><p>Governor of Kano State, Dr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwanso and members </p><p>of the Governor\'s Cabinet.  Whitaker elaborated on the AGOA </p><p>initiative and its achievements in Lesotho, Madagascar, </p><p>Kenya, Namibia and South Africa.  She noted that leather </p><p>(hides) could be produced at a comparative advantage in Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Governor Kwankwanso thanked the Ambassador for the Gum </p><p>Arabic Initiative, noting that the press in Kano State has </p><p>called it the "Ambassador,s Initiative".  The Governor said </p><p>that the gum arabic plantation in Jigawa was shared between </p><p>both States since Jigawa was originally part of Kano State. </p><p>Governor Kwankwanso said that his government would support </p><p>farmers\' participation in the initiative, and Kano would </p><p>definitely benefit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Ambassador and Whitaker also paid a courtesy visit </p><p>on the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero.  The Ambassador </p><p>discussed the willingness of the United States to help the </p><p>Nigerian agricultural sector and the economy of Kano.  USAID </p><p>had just sponsored a conference for Nigerian exporters and </p><p>trade associations to identify export products where Nigeria </p><p>might have a comparative advantage.  Whitaker noted that </p><p>Nigeria was not fully availing itself of opportunities such </p><p>as AGOA.  Nigeria has comparative advantage in several </p><p>products, e.g. cashew nuts, leather (hides), ginger, sesame </p><p>and cotton because of duty free treatment under AGOA.  The </p><p>Ambassador advised that a private sector-led development </p><p>strategy should be pursued in areas such as fertilizer sales </p><p>and distribution, and USAID had just launched an initiative </p><p>to do just that. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. Whitaker emphasized that if Nigeria does not move quickly </p><p>under AGOA, the country could miss the window of opportunity </p><p>currently provided by large amounts of available capital </p><p>seeking investment opportunities.  The Emir agreed that </p><p>Kano\'s economy was based primarily on agriculture and looked </p><p>forward to future U.S. cooperation with Kano, such as USAID\'s </p><p>proposed meetings with Kano agriculturists.  The Emir praised </p><p>the Gum Arabic Initiative and hoped it would be a success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Jigawa State Governor Turaki </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Governor Turaki, through the gum arabic and other </p><p>initiatives, provides an excellent example of how a </p><p>successful State Governor can "deliver the goods" to his </p><p>constituency.  Governor Turaki has generated several </p><p>initiatives during numerous trips to the U.S. in pursuit of </p><p>foreign investment and trade.  The Governor\'s success has </p><p>helped to vindicate him from growing criticism of </p><p>participating in "excessive" trips abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. Besides the gum arabic initiative, Governor Turaki\'s </p><p>other initiatives are noteworthy.  First, Arkel Sugar in </p><p>Louisiana has agreed to develop a sugar production project in </p><p>Jigawa that may expand to include a bio-mass energy </p><p>production facility.  Second, a Maryland firm, TCS, recently </p><p>completed the first phase (broad band network) of Jigawa\'s </p><p>telecommunications infrastructure as a part of the Governor\'s </p><p>plan to have internet accessibility for all schools in the </p><p>state.  Third, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has been </p><p>working in Jigawa over the past two years to complete the </p><p>state\'s infrastructure plan and will soon begin installing a </p><p>power project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. Several prominent Nigerian officials skeptical of </p><p>Turaki\'s trips abroad expressed surprise and pleasure that </p><p>the Governor is now landing deals.  These officials </p><p>unexpectedly opined that of all Nigeria\'s State Governors, </p><p>Turaki was the least likely to be re-elected in 2003 due to </p><p>the perception that he has spent more time abroad than in </p><p>Jigawa.  Many have criticized him for trying to do too much </p><p>in an unfocused manner.  However, President Obasanjo told the </p><p>Ambassador and Whitaker that he approved of Governor Turaki; </p><p>"He\'s a maverick.  People think he\'s a mad-man, but he\'s mad </p><p>with a method," he said.  Now that Turaki\'s initiatives have </p><p>borne fruit, we suspect that his election prospect will be </p><p>enhanced in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. The Gum Arabic Initiative was a great success and </p><p>positive image-maker for the U.S. Mission in Nigeria. </p><p>Through this initiative, the USG has made significant inroads </p><p>in introducing U.S. businesses to Northern Nigeria, a </p><p>previously overlooked region.  Moreover, the USG has earned </p><p>credibility with the Ministries of Commerce and Agriculture </p><p>and northern State Governors in bringing U.S. investment into </p><p>the country.  While the Embassy is receiving credit for this </p><p>program, this initiative was really conceived and implemented </p><p>by AUSTR Rosa Whitaker.  Ms. Whitaker deserves full credit </p><p>for her hard work and leadership over the past two years to </p><p>make this initiative a reality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
