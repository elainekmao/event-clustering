(C) THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>HAS MOVED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS BY </p><p>HIRING A RESPECTED CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVIST TO BE NATIONAL </p><p>COORDINATOR TO MANAGE THE PARTY\'S AFFAIRS AND A PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL TO RUN ITS INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. </p><p>THE PARTY IS WORKING HARD TO DEVISE A RANGE OF THOROUGHLY </p><p>VETTED POLICIES, AND TO DISSEMINATE THEM WIDELY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>LACK OF RESOURCES AND DISTRUST BETWEEN THE PARTY\'S YOUNG </p><p>AND OLD MEMBERS REMAIN SERIOUS PROBLEMS.  DESPITE </p><p>INTENSIFYING INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT OF ITS SENIOR </p><p>LEADERS, THE MDC IS ACTIVELY PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  THE RECENT ELECTION OF A PRO-MDC </p><p>SLATE TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE </p><p>UNIONS (ZCTU) PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO THE ELECTORAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00930  01 OF 04  061550Z </p><p>STRATEGY OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY, WHICH ALSO IS MOVING </p><p>ENERGETICALLY TO COURT RURAL VOTERS, HISTORICALLY A ZANU-PF </p><p>STRONGHOLD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) WE HAVE MET RECENTLY WITH A VARIETY OF SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>(MDC), INCLUDING DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL GIFT CHIMANIKIRE, </p><p>MPS AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TRUDY STEVENSON, DAVID </p><p>COLTART, PAUL NYATHI, AND TENDAI BITI, AND ASSISTANT TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT GANDI MUDZINGWA.  THEY PROVIDED KEEN INSIGHTS ON </p><p>THE MDC\'S INTERNAL DYNAMICS AND ITS PRIORITIES, INCLUDING </p><p>THE PARTY\'S STRATEGY FOR THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>RESTRUCTURING </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE </p><p>HAS SERIOUSLY HAMPERED THE MDC\'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN </p><p>INTERNAL COHESIVENESS, LET ALONE BUILD ON ITS ACHIEVEMENTS </p><p>IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  IN A FEBRUARY 27 </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, MP DAVID COLTART </p><p>DESCRIBED THE PARTY\'S INFORMATION DEPARTMENT AS A "DISASTER" </p><p>AND THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT AS A "MESS."  HIS COLLEAGUE </p><p>TRUDY STEVENSON AGREED, POINTING OUT TO US ON FEBRUARY 23 </p><p>THAT EVEN SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE PARTY ARE NOT KEPT IN THE </p><p>LOOP ON MAJOR PARTY EVENTS.  FOR INSTANCE, SHE HAD HEARD </p><p>THAT MDC RALLIES WOULD BE HELD THE FOLLOWING DAY IN </p><p>HARARE, BUT SHE, ALTHOUGH AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER, </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED WHERE OR WHEN THEY WOULD BE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC HAS RECENTLY MOVED TO ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00930  01 OF 04  061550Z </p><p>SHORTCOMING, HOWEVER, BY HIRING A NATIONAL COORDINATOR WHO </p><p>WILL, QUITE LITERALLY, COORDINATE AND ALL OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  (COMMENT: THE PERSON SELECTED FOR THIS POSITION, </p><p>ISAAC MAPOSA, DEMONSTRATED AN IMPRESSIVE TALENT FOR </p><p>MARSHALING PEOPLE AND RESOURCES WHEN HE WAS EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S EFFORT </p><p>IN 1999 TO DRAFT A NEW CONSTITUTION.  HE IS WELL-LIKED AND </p><p>WELL-RESPECTED, AND ALL OF THE MDC MEMBERS WITH WHOM WE </p><p>SPOKE WERE CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE SOME </p><p>DISCIPLINE ON A PARTY WHICH SORELY NEEDS IT.  MAPOSA </p><p>REPORTEDLY TOOK UP HIS NEW DUTIES IN EARLY MARCH, IN SPITE </p><p>OF UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS ABOUT REMUNERATION.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) STEVENSON TOLD US THAT THE MDC PLANS TO HOLD </p><p>REGULAR POLICY RETREATS ON PARTICULAR ISSUES.  THE FIRST </p><p>ONE -- HELD IN LATE JANUARY -- FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY AND </p><p>LAND; THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, </p><p>AND PROVINCIAL CHAIRPERSONS ALL PARTICIPATED. THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE RETREATS, STEVENSON STRESSED, ARE TO </p><p>THOROUGHLY VET POLICY POSITIONS BEFORE THEY ARE ANNOUNCED </p><p>PUBLICLY AND TO ENSURE THAT MPS AND OTHER SENIOR PARTY </p><p>OFFICIALS DELIVER A CONSISTENT MESSAGE.   THE PARTY\'S </p><p>POSITIONS WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE EXPLAINED IN REGULAR </p><p>MEETINGS TO CONSTITUENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5829 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00930  02 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CE44CE  061551Z /38 </p><p>R 061548Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8365 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 000930 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AA/AFR, VDICKSON-HORTON, AND AFR/SA, CPALMA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00930  02 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE LEADERSHIP TAKES </p><p>STOCK OF PARTY DEFICIENCIES AND CONCRETE STEPS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THEM </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) STEVENSON LAMENTED THAT THE PARTY\'S INFORMATION </p><p>AND PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN INEFFECTUAL, IN LARGE </p><p>PART BECAUSE IT WAS RUN BY A LAWYER -- MP LEARNMORE </p><p>JONGWE -- WHO HAS NO ACADEMIC PREPARATION OR PRACTICAL </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.  SHE EXPRESSED HOPE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE RECENT HIRING OF A PERSON WITH A </p><p>GRADUATE DEGREE IN COMMUNICATIONS WOULD HELP THE PARTY </p><p>SHAPE AND DISSEMINATE A CONSISTENT, EFFECTIVE MESSAGE </p><p>AND DEVELOP A DYNAMIC PUBLIC RELATIONS STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>LACK OF RESOURCES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A LACK OF RESOURCES CONTINUES TO POSE A SERIOUS </p><p>IMPEDIMENT FOR THE MDC.  MDC MP AND DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS </p><p>PAUL NYATHI SAID THE PARTY LITERALLY HAS ALMOST NO MONEY </p><p>IN THE BANK.  ONE REASON THE PARTY FINDS ITSELF IN SUCH </p><p>DIRE FINANCIAL STRAITS IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S STEADFAST </p><p>REFUSAL TO RELEASE FUNDS TO WHICH THE MDC IS ENTITLED </p><p>UNDER THE POLITICAL PARTIES ACT, BY VIRTUE OF ITS STRONG </p><p>SHOWING IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 22, THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY AGREED TO HONOR ITS </p><p>OBLIGATION UNDER THE LAW AND RELEASE WITHIN 30 DAYS 47 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00930  02 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>MILLION ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $630,000) </p><p>TO THE MDC.  MDC MPS DAVID COLTART AND PAUL NYATHI BELIEVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL FIND WAYS TO AVOID HONORING </p><p>THIS COMMITMENT.  WHY, THEY BOTH ASKED, WOULD A GOVERNMENT </p><p>WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED DISDAIN FOR THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDE </p><p>THE MDC WITH A FINANCIAL WINDFALL AS BOTH PARTIES GEAR UP </p><p>FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?  MANY OF THE MDC\'S DOMESTIC </p><p>SOURCES OF REVENUE HAVE DRIED UP, TESTAMENT TO THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION </p><p>AGAINST THE PARTY\'S SUPPORTERS.  COLTART AND NYATHI ARE </p><p>PLANNING A FUNDRAISING TRIP IN LATE MARCH TO LONDON, </p><p>NEW YORK, AND WASHINGTON, WHICH WILL TARGET PRIMARILY </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN EXPATRIATES. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASING THREATS/HARASSMENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE MDC\'S EFFORT TO TRANSFORM ITSELF FROM A PROTEST </p><p>MOVEMENT INTO A GENUINE, EFFECTIVE POLITICAL PARTY HAS BEEN </p><p>HAMPERED BY INTENSIFYING GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED HARASSMENT </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION.  DURING THE LAST MONTH, SENIOR MDC </p><p>OFFICIALS -- INCLUDING PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA -- HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH </p><p>INCITING VIOLENCE (REFS C AND D), WHILE SECURITY SECRETARY </p><p>JOB SIKHALA AND HIS PREGNANT WIFE WERE TWICE BEATEN IN THEIR </p><p>HOME BY MEN WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS.  IN ADDITION, FOUR MEN IN </p><p>CIVILIAN CLOTHES ARRIVED AT SIKHALA\'S HOUSE IN A POLICE </p><p>VEHICLE AT MIDNIGHT ON FEBRUARY 25 THREATENING TO ARREST </p><p>SIKHALA, BUT HE AND HIS FAMILY HID IN A NEARBY FIELD AFTER </p><p>BEING WARNED BY THEIR GUARD.  THE UNKNOWN MEN BEAT SIKHALA\'S </p><p>GUARD AND FIRED AT LEAST ONE SHOT AT HIM AFTER HE MANAGED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00930  02 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>FLEE.  ON FEBRUARY 21, FOUR MDC OFFICIALS FROM VICTORIA FALLS </p><p>WERE ARRESTED AND CHARGED UNDER THE COLONIAL-ERA LAW AND ORDER </p><p>MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA) WITH INCITING PUBLIC VIOLENCE AT A </p><p>FEBRUARY 4 MDC RALLY.  THE FILING OF THESE CHARGES THREE WEEKS </p><p>AFTER THE ALLEGED CRIME -- FLASHING RED CARDS DURING THE RALLY </p><p>-- LIKELY WAS MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT THE MDC </p><p>WOULD NOT TRY TO DISRUPT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S 77TH BIRTHDAY </p><p>CELEBRATION IN VICTORIA FALLS ON FEBRUARY 24.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>RUMORS CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A DEATH LIST </p><p>CONTAINING THE NAMES OF SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>INTERNAL FACTIONS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) TENSIONS BETWEEN THE MDC\'S SHONA AND NDEBELE MEMBERS </p><p>CONTINUE TO SIMMER, BUT THE STRAINS BETWEEN THE PARTY\'S OLDER </p><p>AND YOUNGER MEMBERS SEEM TO BE THE MOST SERIOUS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO STEVENSON, SOME OF THE PARTY\'S YOUNG STARS USE </p><p>UNNECESSARILY SHARP RHETORIC AT PUBLIC RALLIES PORTRAYING THE </p><p>CURRENT POLITICAL STRUGGLE AS PITTING THE YOUNGER GENERATION </p><p>-- REPRESENTED BY THE MDC -- VERSUS THE OLDER, DISCREDITED </p><p>GENERATION -- REPRESENTED BY ZANU-PF.  AN ADDITIONAL CAUSE </p><p>FOR CONCERN, ACCORDING TO STEVENSON, IS THAT YOUNG, </p><p>SOPHISTICATED MDC CADRES STICK LIKE GLUE TO TSVANGIRAI. </p><p>THEY EXPERTLY PLAY ON THE MDC PRESIDENT\'S SENSITIVITY ABOUT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5830 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00930  03 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CE44D7  061551Z /38 </p><p>R 061548Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8366 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 000930 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AA/AFR, VDICKSON-HORTON, AND AFR/SA, CPALMA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00930  03 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE LEADERSHIP TAKES </p><p>STOCK OF PARTY DEFICIENCIES AND CONCRETE STEPS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THEM </p><p> </p><p>HIS LACK OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO MAINTAIN THEIR ACCESS TO HIM </p><p>AND TO PREVENT OTHERS IN THE PARTY FROM GETTING TOO CLOSE. </p><p>AFTER OLDER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE RECENTLY </p><p>COMPLAINED TO TSVANGIRAI THAT THE VEHEMENCE OF HIS YOUNG </p><p>GATEKEEPERS WAS BECOMING A PROBLEM, THE MDC LEADER AGREED TO </p><p>MAKE SOME CHANGES.  STEVENSON, WHO IS PROBABLY IN HER 50S, </p><p>DESCRIBED FOUR YOUNG MDC MEMBERS WHOM SHE DOES NOT TRUST AS </p><p>BEING POSSIBLE ZANU-PF PLANTS -- MPS TAFADZWA MUSEKIWA, JOB </p><p>SIKHALA, AND LEARNMORE JONGWE (THE PARTY\'S SPOKESMAN), AND </p><p>NATIONAL YOUTH LEADER NELSON CHAMISA.  ASKED WHETHER SHE </p><p>TRUSTED TSVANGIRAI\'S PERSONAL ASSISTANT GANDI MUDZINGWA, </p><p>STEVENSON REPLIED, "I DON\'T TRUST ANYONE."  (COMMENT: WE </p><p>HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE STEVENSON\'S SUSPICIONS </p><p>ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  WE CAN SAY WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE THAT HER DISTRUST OF CERTAIN YOUNGER MEMBERS </p><p>IS A RESULT OF ZANU-PF\'S STRATEGY TO SOW DOUBT AND DISCORD </p><p>WITHIN THE OPPOSITION PARTY.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>GEARING UP FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) DESPITE THE CHALLENGES ELABORATED ABOVE, THE MDC </p><p>IS PREPARING ENERGETICALLY FOR THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00930  03 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>ELECTION.  ACCORDING TO MDC DIRECTOR FOR ELECTIONS PAUL </p><p>NYATHI, THE PARTY HAS FORMED A "HUSH-HUSH" NATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>DIRECTORATE IN HARARE THAT IS PLOTTING STRATEGY.  THE MDC </p><p>HAS BEEN HOLDING WELL-ATTENDED RALLIES NATIONWIDE, WHERE IT </p><p>IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO HANG TOUGH IN THE FACE OF VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION, AND TO VOTE, AS THE PRIZE THIS TIME IS </p><p>MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN LAST JUNE\'S.  IN A MARCH 1 MEETING </p><p>WITH POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, MP FOR HARARE EAST TENDAI BITI </p><p>WAS IN UNUSUALLY HIGH SPIRITS, NOTING THAT TURNOUT FOR HIS </p><p>CONSTITUENCY MEETINGS AND THOSE OF MANY OF HIS PARTY </p><p>COLLEAGUES HAD INCREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PAST MONTH. </p><p>ACCORDING TO NYATHI, THE MDC HOPES TO LAUNCH OFFICIALLY ITS </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE TOWNSHIP OF CHITUNGWIZA, WHERE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN BEATING SUSPECTED OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS, "TO GIVE PEOPLE COURAGE." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IN EARLY MARCH, MDC ACTIVISTS FROM RURAL AREAS WERE </p><p>PLANNING TO GATHER IN HARARE TO STRATEGIZE ON HOW TO BOLSTER </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE RURAL AREAS.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE PARTY IS </p><p>DISSEMINATING ITS MESSAGE THROUGH RURAL CHURCHES AND </p><p>RURAL-BASED MEMBERS OF THE ZCTU.  THE RECENT ELECTION OF A </p><p>PRO-MDC SLATE TO THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP, NYATHI POINTED OUT, </p><p>WAS CRUCIAL TO THE MDC\'S ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE RURAL AREAS. </p><p>IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ONGOING CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION </p><p>AGAINST COMMERCIAL FARM OWNERS AND THEIR WORKERS, THE </p><p>120,000-STRONG FARM WORKERS UNION REPRESENTS ESPECIALLY </p><p>FERTILE GROUND FOR THE MDC.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS ALSO </p><p>PAYING SUPPORTERS LIVING IN URBAN AREAS TO RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>RURAL VILLAGES TO CAMPAIGN QUIETLY.  (COMMENT: WE DO NOT KNOW </p><p>THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY WITH WHICH THIS IS OSTENSIBLY BEING </p><p>DONE.  END COMMENT).  THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00930  03 OF 04  061551Z </p><p>AS RURAL RESIDENTS WILL BE MUCH MORE WILLING TO LISTEN TO A </p><p>FAMILIAR FACE, WHO IS LESS LIKELY TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION -- </p><p>AND WRATH -- OF ZANU-PF THUGS.  SO FAR, 52 WARDS HAVE BEEN </p><p>"ASSIGNED" AN URBAN-DWELLING RESIDENT. (NOTE: EACH OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S 120 ELECTORAL CONSTITUENCIES COMPRISES BETWEEN </p><p>FIVE AND TWENTY WARDS. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ACCORDING TO NYATHI, THE MDC IS "ASSURED" OF WINNING </p><p>THE PROVINCES OF MATABELELAND NORTH AND SOUTH, MANICALAND, </p><p>AND MIDLANDS.  MASHONALAND EAST, WEST, AND CENTRAL WERE </p><p>PROBLEMATIC, AS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED INTIMIDATION THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN SIGNIFICANT.  HOWEVER, NYATHI BELIEVED THERE IS ROOM FOR </p><p>THE MDC TO INCREASE ITS SUPPORT IN THOSE TRADITIONAL </p><p>STRONGHOLDS OF THE RULING PARTY, AS THE SEATS WON BY ZANU-PF </p><p>IN JUNE WERE BY VERY HIGH MARGINS, WHILE TURNOUT WAS LOW IN </p><p>THOSE CONSTITUENCIES WON BY THE MDC.

IN FACT, MOST OBSERVERS EXPECT </p><p>THEM TO RESERVE JUDGMENT UNTIL ALL 37 CASES HAVE BEEN HEARD, </p><p>MEANING WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE A FINAL RESOLUTION FOR MANY </p><p>MORE MONTHS.

THERE IS </p><p>A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AMONG ITS SENIOR OFFICIALS THAT WE HAVE </p><p>NOT SEEN SINCE THE EUPHORIA OF THEIR ELECTORAL SHOWING LAST </p><p>JUNE.  THE HIRING OF A NATIONAL COORDINATOR AND A PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL, ALONG WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A </p><p>RIGOROUS INTERNAL POLICY-VETTING SHOP, WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME </p><p>OF THE PARTY\'S STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES, ESPECIALLY THE ABSENCE </p><p>OF CLEAR POLICY POSITIONS AND INEFFECTUAL INTERNAL AND </p><p>EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.  THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR LIKELY WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO USE HIS IMPRESSIVE MANAGEMENT AND INTERPERSONAL </p><p>SKILLS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PARTY\'S FACTIONAL TENSIONS. </p><p>THE MDC IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF POLITICAL MATURITY AS </p><p>WELL, BY REACHING OUT TO THE DIPLOMATIC HEADS OF MISSION </p><p>(REF A) AND ADVOCATING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT, AS OPPOSED </p><p>TO IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.
