(u)  Summary:  In a meeting with econoff hosted by the </p><p>local AmCham, a visiting delegation from the Iraq Federation </p><p>of Industries requested a meeting with CPA Chief Ambassador </p><p>Bremer, and sought support for the establishment of a joint </p><p>US-Jordanian-Iraqi Chamber of Commerce.  Federation Board </p><p>Members described the state of key industrial sectors and </p><p>asked for help in re-constituting private sector industry in </p><p>Iraq through sector reform and match-making with potential </p><p>foreign joint venture partners.  While conditions in industry </p><p>were described as seriously deficient, the Federation is </p><p>confident Iraqi private sector businesses can help now to </p><p>rebuild the country\'s infrastructure, if they are given the </p><p>opportunity.  An overview of selected sectors as provided by </p><p>federation is listed at the end of this cable.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQI INDUSTRIALIST SEEKS SPECIAL SOMEONE </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Five board members of the Iraqi Federation of </p><p>Industries, visiting Amman to participate in a June 5 </p><p>reconstruction conference (ref b), met econoff June 10 at the </p><p>Amman Chamber of Industry to describe the state of their </p><p>industries and to request assistance in jumpstarting Iraq\'s </p><p>private manufacturing sectors.  The Federation met earlier in </p><p>the week with GOJ economic ministries and technical staff, </p><p>and inked a "cooperation agreement" with the Jordan </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (a business executives\' </p><p>association) on June 9. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Federation Vice President Hamzah Habib said the </p><p>first priority of the Federation was to gain a meeting with </p><p>CPA head Ambassador Bremer.  Habib said Iraqi private sector </p><p>companies were being left out of the rebuilding effort, and </p><p>said the Federation believed an introduction to OCPA would </p><p>give them a chance to show their capabilities and offer their </p><p>services.  To this end, Habib asked that Embassy pass Bremer </p><p>a verbal invitation to visit the Federation\'s "provisional" </p><p>office (the previous office has been bombed, burned out, and </p><p>looted) at the al Auchi building, opposite the old </p><p>Agriculture Ministry and next to the Babylon Bank. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Habib said the Federation hoped to create soon a </p><p>joint U.S.-Jordanian-Iraqi Chamber of Commerce that could </p><p>facilitate match-making and other commercial activity among </p><p>associations from the three countries.  He said he had </p><p>already spoken with the Amman Chamber of Industry and the </p><p>Jordanian AmCham, JABA (both of whom were present) about </p><p>cooperation in this regard.  Econoff noted there would </p><p>undoubtedly be interest in the U.S. and Jordanian private </p><p>sectors in business opportunities in Iraq, and welcomed the </p><p>Federation\'s cooperation with JABA and ACI as a first step </p><p>toward exploring those opportunities with the U.S. private </p><p>sector.  (JABA reps later told econoff they were developing a </p><p>plan to serve as a bridge between the National U.S.-Arab </p><p>Chamber of Commerce and/or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with </p><p>credible Iraqi businesses.) </p><p> </p><p>ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT A PLUS </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Habib said the Federation represented over 25,000 </p><p>private sector entities covering all sectors of the Iraqi </p><p>private economy.  These entities, he said, collectively </p><p>employed over 3 million people in their heyday.  He noted, </p><p>though, that since the Saddam Hussein regime began funneling </p><p>production away from the private sector and into the hands of </p><p>State-Owned Enterprises (SOE\'s) and foreign firms in 1995, </p><p>the private sector had stagnated.  As a result, Habib </p><p>estimated 90-95% of private businesses were non-operational </p><p>and virtually all employees were out of work.  He attributed </p><p>lack of access to contracts and raw materials since 1995 as </p><p>key contributors to the collapse of the private sector, </p><p>adding that these troubles continued in the present day and </p><p>were compounded by the absence of a financial system - which </p><p>had already wiped out business savings and frozen out access </p><p>to credit for rebuilding businesses.  Nevertheless, he said, </p><p>some businesses were still operating, and could prove willing </p><p>and able partners to foreign firms with a high tolerance for </p><p>adventure (i.e., risk and ambiguity). </p><p> </p><p>MUST HAVE OWN RAW MATERIALS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Habib said the primary hurdle to restarting </p><p>production was lack of access to raw materials.  Under </p><p>Saddam, what little raw materials Iraq had were funneled to </p><p>SOE\'s, which were also subsidized when buying inputs from </p><p>abroad.  Private sector enterprises, by and large, could not </p><p>compete with SOE\'s preferential treatment or economies of </p><p>scale.  Similarly, private sector companies during the </p><p>sanctions years lost all access to spare parts and </p><p>replacement equipment.  As a result, Habib said that the </p><p>small percentage of operational equipment in the private </p><p>sector was at least a decade old, and some machinery dated </p><p>back to the 1970\'s.  He said this resulted in Iraqi </p><p>businesses being relatively more labor-intensive than </p><p>regional counterparts.  He noted further that, despite the </p><p>age of much of the equipment, industries in lower-tech </p><p>sectors like construction materials and wood working could </p><p>still be relied on to produce for the local market. </p><p> </p><p>GULF NEED NOT APPLY </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Habib said Iraqis were eager to see SOE\'s privatized </p><p>as soon as possible, and said his members looked forward to </p><p>having opportunities to enter into joint ventures with </p><p>prospective buyers of existing SOE\'s.  He added that </p><p>preserving SOE\'s as active entities remaining under state </p><p>control would be totally unacceptable to the Iraqi people. </p><p>Habib expressed the opinion that the CPA "should not let </p><p>companies from the Gulf" take over privatized SOE\'s.  He said </p><p>sale to the Gulf of these key Iraqi assets would deeply anger </p><p>many Iraqis, who had poor relations with, and deep distrust </p><p>of, their Gulf neighbors.  Habib said the only "acceptable" </p><p>partners for Iraqi interests in the privatization process </p><p>were "the Americans and the Jordanians," the former because </p><p>they had freed the Iraqi people and the latter because they </p><p>had strong ties to the Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p>SNAPSHOT ATTACHED </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  Following are brief outlines of selected industry </p><p>sectors provided to econoff by the Federation.  The numbers </p><p>are probably not accurate, but could serve as good ballpark </p><p>figures. </p><p> </p><p>Woodworking -- </p><p> </p><p>Number of private sector entities:  2,000 </p><p>Entities with "significant" employment (>50 workers): 20% </p><p>Entities currently active:  5-10% </p><p>Sector employment:  500,000 </p><p>Critical needs:  raw materials, equipment upgrades </p><p>Specializations: doors/treatments, furniture, school desks </p><p> </p><p>Contact:  Engineer Sabah Kubba </p><p>Tel (Thuraya): 00-88-216-2166-3554 </p><p>e-mail: mawi@uruklink.net </p><p> </p><p>Construction Materials -- </p><p> </p><p>Number of Private sector entities:  12,000 </p><p>Entities with "significant" employment (>100 workers): 10% </p><p>Entities currently active:  5-10% </p><p>Sector Employment:  600,000 </p><p>Critical needs: raw materials, access to contracts, spare </p><p>parts </p><p>Specializations: cement, brick, marble, granite, mosaic tile, </p><p>ready-mix concrete </p><p> </p><p>Contact 1: Mr. Saleh al Jalaby (Chalaby) </p><p>Tel (Thuraya): 00-88-216-2123-4043 </p><p>e-mail: s.chala@uruklink.net </p><p> </p><p>Contact 2: Mr. Ahmad Abu Jiss </p><p>Tel (Thuraya): 00-88-216-5115-9744 </p><p>e-mail: objuss@uruklink.net </p><p> </p><p>Chemicals -- </p><p> </p><p>Number of private sector entities: 1,500 </p><p>Sector Employment: 750,000-1,000,000 </p><p>Critical needs: access to raw materials </p><p>Specializations: paints, solvents, detergents, emulsions </p><p>Prior business: claims prior business interest from Proctor </p><p>and Gamble </p><p> </p><p>Contact:  Mr. Hamzah Habib </p><p>Tel (Thuraya):  00-88-216-2123-7982 </p><p>e-mail:  none </p><p> </p><p>Engineering/Machinery/Metalworking -- </p><p> </p><p>Number of Private Sector entities:  7,000 </p><p>Entities currently active:  20% </p><p>Sector Employment:  3-400,000 (production and servicing) </p><p>Critical needs: raw materials, spare parts </p><p>Specializations:  machinery, spare parts, steel finished </p><p>goods (incl. furniture, doors, etc.) </p><p> </p><p>Contact:  Dr. Thabet al Badawi </p><p>c/o Federation of Industries (or Mr. Habib above) </p><p> </p><p>Note:  Badawi believes the machinery sector can provide an </p><p>immediate benefit to reconstruction efforts.  He noted that </p><p>Bechtel\'s assessment of priorities at ref b conference </p><p>highlighted the contractor\'s commitment to, in the first </p><p>stage, repairing existing equipment instead of upgrading or </p><p>replacing equipment.  Badawi said Iraqi firms are uniquely </p><p>placed to be able to service and fabricate parts for this </p><p>outdated equipment, alleviating the need for Bechtel to find </p><p>outside companies that can reverse-engineer old parts and </p><p>machinery. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
