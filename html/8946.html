<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: AK GOVERNMENT TIGHTENS THE SCREWS ON </p><p>CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 1927 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3784 </p><p>     C. 02 ANKARA 7317 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: AK Party is engaging in a broad and popular </p><p>anti-corruption campaign for both normative policy and </p><p>narrower, hardball political reasons.  By doing so, P.M. </p><p>Erdogan and AK are: 1) implicating both their political and </p><p>bureaucratic rivals; thereby 2) putting them on the defensive </p><p>and undercutting their ability to mount opposition to EU </p><p>reform and other elements of the AK agenda; and in the </p><p>process 3) deflecting criticism from long-standing corruption </p><p>charges against Erdogan and other AK members.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As noted in ref A, corruption in all its forms is </p><p>deeply embedded in Turkish social, political, and </p><p>bureaucratic life, although public attitudes are noticeably </p><p>changing.  Ongoing economic difficulties and the drive for EU </p><p>membership have focused public opinion on the more subversive </p><p>aspects of graft in politics but also, significantly, in the </p><p>military -- long viewed as Turkey\'s most respected </p><p>institution.  Increased public criticism of endemic </p><p>corruption helped paved the way for the ruling AK Party\'s </p><p>victory in the November 2002 elections in part because AK was </p><p>seen as cleaner than its electoral rivals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>The new offensive </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AK -- which means "clean" in Turkish -- made </p><p>corruption a campaign theme but until now had done little on </p><p>this front, given the pressing business of Iraq and other </p><p>issues.  With the war over, AK is refocusing on the issue. </p><p>An AK-led  Parliamentary investigative commission is probing </p><p>the improprieties of previous governments, including those of </p><p>Bulent Ecevit and Tansu Ciller. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Thus far, the commission has interviewed a host of senior </p><p>politicians from the Ecevit administration, including </p><p>then-Deputy P.M.s Mesut Yilmaz (long seen as up to his neck </p><p>in corrupt business deals) and Ecevit\'s former right-hand man </p><p>Husamettin Ozkan.  It has also "invited" Ecevit himself to </p><p>speak to the panel.  While it remains to be seen whether the </p><p>commission\'s efforts will bear fruit, its inquiries continue </p><p>to make media headlines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The commission is also interested in probing the proposed </p><p>sale of AWACS aircraft to Turkey, including allegations that </p><p>the price was "improperly inflated" and not fully accounted </p><p>for on the books.  (Note: Boeing and SSM officials tell us, </p><p>however, that Parliament\'s decision to take a closer look at </p><p>the deal is not new.  They also insist the contract -- which </p><p>recently entered into effect -- is not in jeopardy.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Moreover, on June 12, Turkish authorities seized </p><p>control of Cukurova Electricity and Kepez Electricity, both </p><p>of which are owned by the notoriously corrupt Uzan family -- </p><p>including Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan, head of the Genc </p><p>(Young) Party that is emerging as AK\'s most ardent </p><p>challenger.  As reported in ref B, the Uzans have allegedly: </p><p>1) used these companies to extort money and favors from local </p><p>industries; 2) failed to comply with investment commitments </p><p>and GOT regulations; and 3) misused its Imar Bank for </p><p>nefarious financial purposes (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Why Now </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) This latest push comes against a backdrop of sustained </p><p>popularity for P.M. Erdogan and the AK Party.  It also comes </p><p>amid a growing willingness -- even among more </p><p>Establishment-oriented elements in the press and elsewhere -- </p><p>to scrutinize defenders of the status quo, including the </p><p>military, for their widely perceived resistance to </p><p>comprehensive EU-related and other reforms.  Clearly, AK </p><p>recognizes the anti-corruption campaign as good policy and </p><p>good politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- AK members of Parliament\'s Defense Committee have recently </p><p>expressed to us their determination to bring the budgeting </p><p>process under more direct scrutiny and oversight, including a </p><p>defense budget that heretofore has been subjected to </p><p>virtually no civilian control.  Kemal Kaya, a close adviser </p><p>to NATO Parliamentary Assembly Chairman Vahit Erdem, offered </p><p>to us the AK perspective on the corruption problem. </p><p>"Whatever exists in society," he said, "exists in the </p><p>military too."  The goal, according to AK contacts, is aimed </p><p>at nothing less than ending the military\'s dominance of </p><p>political and social life in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Uzan, the newest poster-boy for corruption, has lashed out </p><p>publicly against P.M. Erdogan, calling him "merciless" and </p><p>"godless" in a recent stump-speech in Bursa.  Erdogan is now </p><p>suing Uzan for defamation, and the Bursa Prosecutor\'s office </p><p>has filed similar motions -- which, given Turkey\'s current </p><p>restrictive speech regulations, could in theory land the Genc </p><p>leader in prison and ban him from politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Its All Relative? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While AK makes the right noises, there are legitimate </p><p>questions as to the extent it is in fact different from the </p><p>other parties and players on the corruption issue.  AK is </p><p>generally regarded as far and above the rest of the crowd, a </p><p>legacy in part of its Islamist roots and the widespread </p><p>perception in Turkey that Islam-influenced politicians are </p><p>therefore more moral and dedicated at least in some measure </p><p>to a cause beyond themselves.  On the other hand, as the </p><p>party increasingly inclines toward the "mainstream," it has </p><p>taken on some of the traits it criticizes in its mainstream </p><p>rivals.  While most observers seem willing for now to give AK </p><p>on balance the benefit of the doubt, they do not </p><p>automatically bestow upon it the mantle of (relative) </p><p>personal probity that many conceded, however grudgingly, to </p><p>former P.M. Erbakan, founder of the Refah-Fazilet-Saadet </p><p>parties and godfather of Islamism in Turkey.  While Erbakan\'s </p><p>skirting of the law was generally chalked up to his </p><p>movement-building enterprise, there is a whiff of simple </p><p>pocket-lining surrounding both Erdogan and some of his </p><p>associates from his days as Mayor of Istanbul.  While </p><p>venality is not a dominant theme associated with AK, it is </p><p>present nonetheless in the commentaries of AK opponents in </p><p>the press and elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Erdogan has long been accused of impropriety, </p><p>beginning with mayoral tenure and more recently involving </p><p>questionable relations with shady characters including failed </p><p>bankers and other elements (ref c).  While much of this </p><p>reflects a failed effort by the State Establishment to </p><p>discredit Erdogan and his party before the 2002 elections, </p><p>the rumors persist -- with some justification.  According to </p><p>several Embassy contacts, AK officials in the bureaucracy </p><p>have solicited bribes in return for their support for </p><p>particular projects.  As one leading businessman explained to </p><p>us June 24, Turkey in 2003 is still dominated by the </p><p>customary grant of favors and "gifts" to grease the wheels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>The Upper Hand </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Despite such charges, the anti-corruption campaign </p><p>serves both AK\'s normative and narrower, hardball political </p><p>interests by: 1) offering a public demonstration that AK is </p><p>living up to its billing; 2) providing a convenient club with </p><p>which to subdue the Government\'s rivals and challengers -- </p><p>including the TGS and Uzan; and 3) deflecting criticism from </p><p>long-standing charges against Erdogan and others.  Cuneyt </p><p>Ulsever, "Hurriyet" columnist and a leading critic of both </p><p>the Establishment and AK, explained to us June 20 that </p><p>"Erdogan is basically challenging the Establishment" to show </p><p>its cards, which Ulsever thought required a certain element </p><p>of intestinal fortitude on the part of the P.M.  In Ulsever\'s </p><p>view, AK\'s jiu-jitsu tactics make charges against </p><p>Erdogan-the-corruption-fighter appear even more like an </p><p>Establishment put-up job. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
