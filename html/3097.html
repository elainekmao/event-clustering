<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 07 ABUJA 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR: DRL/CRA,DRL/IRF, DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: 2002 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The status of respect for religious freedom in Nigeria </p><p>remained basically unchanged during the year. The </p><p>Constitution provides for freedom of religion, including </p><p>freedom to change one\'s religion or belief and freedom to </p><p>manifest and propagate one\'s religion or belief in worship, </p><p>teaching, practice and observance.  The Constitution also </p><p>prohibits state and local governments from adopting an </p><p>official religion, but it provides that states may elect to </p><p>apply Islamic (Shari\'a) criminal law. Following the lead of </p><p>ten other Northern States, Borno and Gombe States also </p><p>adopted forms of criminal Shari\'a law in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Discrimination based on religion continued during the period </p><p>covered by this report in some states. Although Christians </p><p>and other non-Muslims are exempt from Shari\'a law, the </p><p>ramifications of expanded Shari\'a law at times infringed upon </p><p>the rights of non-Muslims in the states that have enacted </p><p>expanded Shari\'a. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Inter-religious tension remained high in parts of  Nigeria </p><p>during the year. Plateau State was the scene of violent </p><p>ethno-religious conflict in September 2001.  Discrimination </p><p>against religious minorities was noted in some areas of the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy officials regularly discussed religious freedom </p><p>issues with various federal, state and local officials and </p><p>prominent Nigerians. U.S. Embassy officials and U.S. </p><p>Government officials based in Washington advocated the </p><p>peaceful resolution of ethnic and religious conflicts in the </p><p>country. The U.S. Government stressed that human rights and </p><p>religious freedom must be respected in any resolution of the </p><p>Shari\'a question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECTION I. RELIGIOUS DEMOGRAPHY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The country has a total land area of 356,700 square miles, </p><p>with an estimated population of 120 million; however, there </p><p>has not been an accurate census for more than 30 years, and </p><p>many observers believe  the country\'s population  exceeds </p><p>this estimate. Approximately half of the country\'s population </p><p>practice Islam; approximately 40 percent practice </p><p>Christianity, and approximately 10 percent practice </p><p>traditional indigenous religions or no religion. Many persons </p><p>practice elements of Christianity or Islam and elements of a </p><p>traditional indigenous religion. The predominant form of </p><p>Islam is Sunni. The Christian population includes Roman </p><p>Catholics, Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, </p><p>and a growing number of evangelical and Pentecostal </p><p>Christians. Catholics constitute the largest Christian </p><p>denomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is a strong correlation between religious differences </p><p>and ethnic and regional diversity. The North, which is </p><p>dominated by the large Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups, is </p><p>predominantly Muslim; however, there are Christian majorities </p><p>in several Middle Belt states and significant numbers of </p><p>Christians in all urban centers of the North. In the </p><p>Southwest, where the large Yoruba ethnic group is in the </p><p>majority, there is no dominant religion. Most Yorubas </p><p>practice either Islam or Christianity, while others continue </p><p>to practice the traditional Yoruba religion, which includes a </p><p>belief in a supreme deity and the worship of lesser deities </p><p>that serve as agents of the supreme deity in aspects of daily </p><p>life. In the East, where the large Igbo ethnic group is </p><p>dominant, Catholics and Methodists are in the majority, </p><p>although many Igbos continue to observe traditional rites and </p><p>ceremonies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign missionaries operate in the country and include </p><p>Jesuits, Dominicans, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day </p><p>Saints (Mormons), the Church of Christ, and the Society for </p><p>International Missions, among others. Rough estimates put the </p><p>number of foreign Christian missionaries at over 1,000, with </p><p>many in the area around Jos, in Plateau state.  Many have </p><p>resided in Nigeria for a decade or longer.  There are </p><p>reportedly fewer foreign Muslim missionaries, and they tend </p><p>toward briefer stays than their Christian counterparts. </p><p>Muslim organizations often focus on training Nigerians in </p><p>traditional centers of Islamic education and then returning </p><p>them to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECTION II. STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL/POLICY FRAMEWORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, including </p><p>freedom to change one\'s religion or belief, and freedom to </p><p>manifest and propagate one\'s religion or belief in worship, </p><p>teaching, practice, and observance.  The Federal Government </p><p>generally protects these rights.  However, some state </p><p>governments restricted these rights in practice in certain </p><p>respects with impunity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits state and local governments from </p><p>adopting an official religion; however, some Christians have </p><p>alleged that Islam has been adopted as the de facto state </p><p>religion of several Northern states, citing the </p><p>reintroduction of Shari\'a criminal law, and the continued use </p><p>of state resources to fund the construction of mosques, the </p><p>teaching of Alkalis (Muslim judges), and pilgrimages to Mecca </p><p>(Hajj). However, state funds also are used to fund Christian </p><p>pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In general, states with a clear </p><p>Christian or Muslim majority overtly favor the majority </p><p>faith. There are 36 states in the country; governors have </p><p>substantial autonomy in decision-making but derive the vast </p><p>majority of their resources from the Federal Government. Both </p><p>the federal and state governments are involved in religious </p><p>matters, including the regulation of mandatory religious </p><p>instruction in public schools, subsidized construction of </p><p>churches and mosques, state-sponsored participation in the </p><p>Hajj, and pilgrimages to Jerusalem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides that states may elect to apply </p><p>Islamic (Shari\'a) law. Until the reintroduction of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a by Zamfara State in January 2000, the jurisdiction of </p><p>Shari\'a courts had been limited to family or personal law </p><p>cases involving Muslims, or to civil disputes between Muslims </p><p>who consent to the courts\' jurisdiction. However, the </p><p>Constitution states that a Shari\'a Court of Appeal may </p><p>exercise "such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it </p><p>by the law of the State." Some states have interpreted this </p><p>language as granting them the right to expand the </p><p>jurisdiction of existing Shari\'a courts to include criminal </p><p>matters (see Section III). On October 8, 1999, the Governor </p><p>of Zamfara State, Ahmed Sani, signed a bill that established </p><p>Shari\'a courts and courts of appeal in Zamfara state, and </p><p>another bill that constituted the Shari\'a penal code; the </p><p>bills took effect on January 27, 2000. Zamfara\'s law adopted </p><p>traditional Shari\'a in its entirety, with the exception that </p><p>apostasy was not criminalized. Other Muslim communities, </p><p>particularly from the states of Kano, Niger, Sokoto, Jigawa, </p><p>Borno, Yobe, Kaduna, and Katsina states, began to echo the </p><p>call for Shari\'a in their states. At the end of the period </p><p>covered by this report, twelve Northern states had adopted </p><p>forms of Shari\'a law-- Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger, Kano, </p><p>Katsina, Kaduna Jigawa, Yobe, Bauchi, Borno and Gombe. </p><p>According to media reports there has been some lobbying among </p><p>elements of the large Muslim minority of Oyo State for the </p><p>implementation of elements of civil  Shari\'a.  However, the </p><p>government has not responded.  Adherence to the new Shari\'a </p><p>provisions is compulsory for Muslims in some states and </p><p>optional in others. The Constitution also provides that the </p><p>Federal Government is to establish a Federal Shari\'a Court of </p><p>Appeal and Final Court of Appeal; however, the Government had </p><p>not yet established such courts by the end of the period </p><p>covered by this report.  Appeals are generally heard by </p><p>regular courts empanelled with justices who have some </p><p>knowledge of Shari\'a law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In November 1999, President Obasanjo expressed the view that </p><p>the expanded Shari\'a provisions were unconstitutional; </p><p>however, the federal Government did not intervene legally to </p><p>annul the provisions. Defendants have the right to challenge </p><p>the constitutionality of Shari\'a criminal statutes through </p><p>the courts.  To date, no such challenge filed by any person </p><p>with legal standing has reached the Federal appellate level. </p><p>Nigeria\'s higher courts have not, therefore, had occasion to </p><p>determine if penalties under Shari\'a law, which differ from </p><p>those applicable under secular law are constitutional. In </p><p>March 2002, Justice Minister Kanu Agabi made public a letter </p><p>to Northern Governors in which he stated that sentences given </p><p>under Shari\'a should not be harsher than those imposed by </p><p>general secular law.   The only noticeable effect was to stir </p><p>debate in the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Christian and Islamic groups planning to build new churches </p><p>or mosques are required to register with the Corporate </p><p>Affairs Commission (CAC). The law requires that such groups </p><p>name a board of trustees, place a notice of the group\'s </p><p>intent to organize in three nationwide newspapers, and send </p><p>trustee information to the CAC. If no objections are </p><p>received, the group can proceed with its meetings. This law </p><p>was put into effect to stem the proliferation of new </p><p>buildings in the absence of zoning laws, to resolve legal </p><p>questions arising from disputes over church ownership and </p><p>control, to provide a single registry for government </p><p>reference in the event that compensation is demanded </p><p>following civil disturbances, and to allow for legal </p><p>solemnization of marriages. The CAC did not deny registration </p><p>to any religious group during the period covered by this </p><p>report; however, some religious groups experienced delays in </p><p>obtaining permission from local zoning boards to build houses </p><p>of worship.  Many nascent churches and Islamic congregations </p><p>ignore the registration requirement, placing themselves </p><p>outside the bounds of legality and making themselves </p><p>vulnerable to sometimes selective enforcement of zoning laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The military\'s chaplaincy corps includes imams, Catholic </p><p>priests, and Protestant pastors. There were no reports in the </p><p>military of discrimination or nonadvancement to senior </p><p>positions due to religious beliefs. No one religious faith </p><p>dominates the senior ranks of the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government remained a member (observer status) of the </p><p>Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) during the period </p><p>covered by this report and continued to send representatives </p><p>to the annual meeting in Cairo. Christian citizens were </p><p>concerned that this action undermined the concept of a </p><p>secular state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Each year the Government declares the following Islamic and </p><p>Christian festival days as national holidays: Eid-el-Adha, </p><p>Eid-el-Fitr, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Eid-el-Maulud, </p><p>Christmas Day and Boxing Day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some state governors actively have encouraged interfaith and </p><p>interethnic discussions. For example, Kaduna Governor Ahmed </p><p>Mohammed Makarfi appointed Muslims and Christians to </p><p>reconciliation committees following the riots of February and </p><p>May 2000. Governor Makarfi also consulted with the </p><p>reconciliation committees on proposed criminal law reforms. </p><p>Reconciliation committees are also consulted before any major </p><p>decisions are taken. The government also encourages the </p><p>activities of NGOs like the Kaduna-based Inter-Faith </p><p>Mediation Center, Muslim/Christian Dialogue Forum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Throughout the year, the Government nominally required </p><p>organizers of outdoor public functions to apply for permits, </p><p>although both government authorities and those assembling </p><p>often ignored this requirement. The Government retained legal </p><p>authority to ban gatherings whose political, ethnic, or </p><p>religious content might lead to unrest. In 2000 several </p><p>Northern state governments banned open air preaching and </p><p>public religious. Such bans were viewed as necessary public </p><p>safety measures after approximately 2,000 people died in </p><p>Shari\'a related violence nationwide in 2000. None of these </p><p>bans had been lifted formally by the end of the period </p><p>covered by this report; however, state governments granted </p><p>some permits on a case-by-case basis. In the southern part of </p><p>the country, large outdoor religious gatherings continued to </p><p>be common. (Note: Trampling deaths from poor crowd control </p><p>are a common occurrence at large outdoor Christian gatherings </p><p>in the South. International evangelists routinely visit </p><p>Nigeria for "crusades" which can attract over 100,000 each </p><p>evening.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following nationwide Shari\'a-related violence in 2000, many </p><p>Northern states banned public proselytizing, although it is </p><p>permitted by the Constitution. Some states, however, allowed </p><p>some public proselytizing by Christians and Muslims. </p><p>Missionaries reported that law enforcement officials often </p><p>harassed them when they proselytized outside of their </p><p>designated zones. Both Christian and Muslim organizations </p><p>alleged that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the </p><p>Immigration Department restricted the entry into the country </p><p>of certain religious practitioners, particularly persons </p><p>suspected of intending to proselytize. Proselytizing did not </p><p>appear to be restricted in the southern part of the country. </p><p>Many missionary groups also have noted bureaucratic delays </p><p>and obstruction and attempts to extort money for the </p><p>processing of necessary residence permits for foreigners; </p><p>however, many foreign businesses and other nonreligious </p><p>organizations have encountered similar difficulties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the expanded Shari\'a laws technically do not apply </p><p>to non-Muslims, the non-Muslim minority, especially in </p><p>Zamfara state, was affected by certain social provisions of </p><p>the laws, such as the separation of the sexes in public </p><p>transportation vehicles and decisions by some entrepreneurs </p><p>not to engage in certain activities out of concern for </p><p>offending Shari\'a sensibilities.  For example, beauty </p><p>contests typically are not held in Shari\'a states.   In </p><p>Zamfara state, Christian associations have arranged for </p><p>private transportation services for Christian females so that </p><p>they are not forced to wait for female only transportation </p><p>provided by the Zamfara state government. Sokoto state\'s </p><p>transportation system is run completely by private operators. </p><p>Sokoto state governor Dalhatu Bafarawa said that the state </p><p>cannot compel private operators to carry female passengers if </p><p>doing so violates their religious convictions. In Zamfara </p><p>state schoolchildren continued to be segregated by gender in </p><p>schools. The Governor of Zamfara also disbursed public funds </p><p>to refurbish mosques. There is a long tradition of separating </p><p>schoolchildren by gender in the North; this practice was </p><p>codified in Kebbi and Sokoto states in May 2000 and is </p><p>enforced in all of the Shari\'a states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Zamfara state, laws proposed during the period covered by </p><p>this report included a dress code for women that bans short </p><p>skirts and trousers, the mandatory closing of shops on </p><p>Fridays, and a ban of video rental clubs. The Christian </p><p>Association of Nigeria (CAN) branch in Zamfara state has </p><p>protested these new laws to the Zamfara state government. </p><p>Reportedly they were told that the first law was proposed on </p><p>public decency grounds, and that the second law only would </p><p>apply to Muslim businesses.  These laws have been read on the </p><p>floor of the State House but have not been enacted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All Muslims in states that expanded Shari\'a to criminal </p><p>matters are subject to the new Shari\'a criminal codes. In </p><p>Zamfara state, all cases involving Muslims must be heard by a </p><p>Shari\'a court. Other states with Shari\'a law still permit </p><p>Muslims to choose common law courts for criminal cases; </p><p>however, societal pressure forces most Muslims to use the </p><p>Shari\'a court system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits religious discrimination; however, state </p><p>government officials often discriminated against adherents of </p><p>minority religions in hiring practices and in awarding state </p><p>contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Christians in the predominantly Muslim northern states also </p><p>alleged that local government officials used zoning </p><p>regulations to stop or slow the establishment of new </p><p>Christian churches. Officials have responded that many of </p><p>these new churches are being formed in traditionally </p><p>residential neighborhoods that were not zoned for religious </p><p>purposes. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) offices </p><p>in Zamfara and Sokoto states alleged that local authorities </p><p>there delayed or denied to Christians certificates of </p><p>occupancy (CO\'s), which are required to show title to land. </p><p>For example, the Catholic Church in Zamfara state has been </p><p>unable to retake possession of a clinic that was confiscated </p><p>during a period of military rule in the 1970\'s. Renewal of </p><p>the CO for the church building was approved; however, the </p><p>Church has been unable to obtain a CO to reoccupy the clinic </p><p>building and the adjoining land. Zamfara and Sokoto state </p><p>officials denied that discrimination was behind the cases </p><p>cited by CAN. State officials said the certification boards </p><p>were dealing with a large backlog of cases for all persons, </p><p>regardless of religious faith.  Muslims have complained that </p><p>they were denied permission to build mosques in the </p><p>predominantly Christian southern states of Abia and Akwa Ibom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although distribution of religious publications remained </p><p>generally unrestricted, the Government continued to enforce </p><p>lightly a ban on published religious advertisements. There </p><p>were reports by Christians in Zamfara state that the state </p><p>government restricted the distribution of religious </p><p>(Christian) literature. In 2000 Bishop Samson Bala of Gusau </p><p>Diocese said that the state radio station had closed its </p><p>doors to Christians. According to the Bishop Bala, </p><p>commercials and paid advertisements containing Christian </p><p>content were not accepted, and only Islamic religious </p><p>programs were aired. Similar discrimination against the use </p><p>of state-owned media for Muslim programming was reported in </p><p>the South.  This situation remains unchanged through the </p><p>reporting period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to the Constitution, students are not required to </p><p>receive instruction relating to a religion other than their </p><p>own; however, public school students throughout the country </p><p>are required to undergo either Islamic or Christian religious </p><p>instruction. Islamic studies are mandatory in public schools </p><p>in Zamfara and other northern states, often to the exclusion </p><p>of Christianity. State authorities assert that students are </p><p>permitted to decline to attend these classes or to request a </p><p>teacher of their own religion to provide alternative </p><p>instruction.  However, teachers of "Christian Religious </p><p>Knowledge" cannot be found in many Northern schools. There </p><p>are reports that Christianity is taught in the same manner in </p><p>Enugu and Edo states, and that Muslim students cannot access </p><p>"Islamic Religious Knowledge" in the public schools. </p><p>Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) leaders volunteered to </p><p>place teachers of Christianity in Zamfara and Sokoto state </p><p>schools, where students alleged that they were being forced </p><p>to take courses in Islamic religious knowledge in order to </p><p>graduate. Governors of both states accepted the offer of </p><p>assistance and stated that they had not been aware of the </p><p>problem; however, CAN did not provide any teachers in either </p><p>state during the reporting period, stating that they lacked </p><p>the available funds to send teachers to the states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to enforce a 1987 ban on religious </p><p>organizations on campuses of primary schools, although </p><p>individual students retain the right to practice their </p><p>religions in recognized places of worship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On December 5, 2000, over 1,500 Muslim students from the </p><p>University of Ibadan and Ibadan public schools gathered at </p><p>Oyo state government offices to protest the failure of public </p><p>schools to offer Islamic studies courses alongside Christian </p><p>courses. To date Islamic courses are still unavailable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups </p><p>from testifying in civil court or giving their testimony less </p><p>weight; however, the testimony of women and non-Muslims is </p><p>usually accorded less weight in Shari\'a courts. For example, </p><p>if one woman testifies, a second woman must also provide </p><p>testimony to equal the weight of the testimony of one man. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abuses of Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The extension of Shari\'a law in many Northern states </p><p>generated a public debate on whether Shari\'a punishments such </p><p>as amputation for theft, stoning for adultery and caning for </p><p>fornication and public drunkenness constituted "torture or </p><p>... inhuman or degrading treatment" as stipulated in the </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On July 6, 2001 Umaru Aliyu had his hand amputated in Sokoto </p><p>State after being convicted of stealing a goat and </p><p>approximately $400 cash. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On October 19, 2001 a local Shari\'a judge in Sokoto State </p><p>sentenced Safiya Hussaini to death by stoning for adultery. </p><p>The judged based his decision on his interpretation that the </p><p>divorced Hussaini\'s  pregnancy was conclusive proof of </p><p>adultery. The court found that Hussaini had also confessed. </p><p>However, Hussainiappealed the sentence arguing ten separate </p><p>grounds for her acquittal. Defense drew from the Koran, the </p><p>Hadiths, the Nigerian Constitution, the Sokoto State Shari\'a </p><p>Penal Code and the Shari\'a Procedure Code. Accepting several </p><p>of the defendant\'s arguments, the Sokoto State Shari\'a Court </p><p>of Appeal overturned the conviction in March of 2002.  The </p><p>court cited several fundamental flaws in the original court\'s </p><p>findings.  First neither the date nor location of the alleged </p><p>crime was specified. Second the charge was not sufficiently </p><p>explained to Ms. Hussaini.  Third, Shari\'a law allows a </p><p>defendant to withdraw a confession any time prior to the </p><p>execution of a sentence, which the defendant did.  Finally, </p><p>the age of the child indicated that the alleged crime must </p><p>have been committed prior to the implementation of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a in Sokoto State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Katsina man was hanged in January in Kaduna State after </p><p>being convicted in a Shari\'a court of stabbing a woman and </p><p>her two children to death while robbing her home. Nigeria\'s </p><p>constitution permits capital punishment, however this is the </p><p>first execution since its return to democracy in 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Also in January a Shari\'a judge was publicly flogged after </p><p>being convicted of consuming alcohol. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In late March in Katsina State, Amina Lawal was sentenced to </p><p>death by stoning after confessing to having a child while </p><p>divorced. The court has allowed Lawal to return to her own </p><p>village at least until January 2004.  The appeals court is </p><p>scheduled to begin hearing her appeal on July 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Four other women have been convicted of adultery under </p><p>Shari\'a law.  Two of these women have been released on bail, </p><p>while two were sentences to pay a fine, which they have done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Seven men convicted of stealing and housebreaking have been </p><p>sentenced to have their right hands amputated in Kano State. </p><p>Two of the men have appeals pending, the other  five have not </p><p>exercised their right to appeal.  In Bauchi State, four men </p><p>convicted of stealing have been sentenced to have their right </p><p>hands amputated.  Bauchi State Governor Adamu Mu\'azu referred </p><p>these cases to the Inspectorate Division of Shari\'a Courts </p><p>for review.  Once the review is complete it is the governor\'s </p><p>decision whether or not the sentences are carried out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other convicted Muslim criminals in Shari\'a law states were </p><p>subjected to public caning for various minor offenses, such </p><p>as petty theft, public consumption of alcohol, and engaging </p><p>in prostitution. Indigent persons without legal </p><p>representation were more likely to have their sentences </p><p>carried out immediately upon being sentenced. </p><p>A number of state-sanctioned and private vigilante Shari\'a </p><p>enforcement groups have formed in states with expanded </p><p>Shari\'a law. In Zamfara state, Governor Ahmed Sani vested the </p><p>local vigilante group with full powers of arrest and </p><p>prosecution because he believed that the police were not </p><p>enforcing the new Shari\'a laws. Governor Saminu Turaki of </p><p>Jigawa state also mobilized a statewide Shari\'a enforcement </p><p>committee to arrest, detain, and prosecute Muslim offenders. </p><p>These groups still exist, but their activities decreased </p><p>during the reporting period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On March 2, 2002  Pastor Tunde Bakare was detained and </p><p>interrogated for 16 hours by the State Security Service (SSS) </p><p>after returning to Nigeria from Ghana.  It is alleged that </p><p>Bakare prophesied the fall of the Obasanjo government and </p><p>that he left Nigeria to avoid the anticipated chaos.  Bakare </p><p>was arrested upon his return from Ghana and questioned by the </p><p>SSS but was not charged.  Media reports claiming that his </p><p>passport was confiscated could not be verified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Six Pakistani Muslim scholars were arrested in Benue </p><p>State September 23 on suspicion of immigration violations. </p><p>They were questioned by Federal Government officials in Abuja </p><p>and subsequently deported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Forced Religious Conversion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of forced religious conversion, </p><p>including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or </p><p>illegally removed from the United States, or of the </p><p>Government\'s refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to </p><p>the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for </p><p>Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Curfews, bans on large religious gatherings outside of </p><p>traditional houses of worship, on religious processions, and </p><p>on proselytization remain in effect in some areas; however, </p><p>some local and state authorities informally relaxed the bans </p><p>in practice, and allowed some public proselytizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since the outbreak of Shari\'a-related violence in 2000,  the </p><p>governors of Kaduna, Abia, and Lagos states have taken steps </p><p>to prevent further violence and tension. During the period </p><p>covered by this report, the governors made more tempered </p><p>public statements, and focused on shared economic </p><p>opportunities between residents of their states and migrants </p><p>from other regions of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many non-Muslims had feared that implementation of Shari\'a </p><p>would change their way of life but there has been little or </p><p>no change for most people.  While some state and local </p><p>governments have stringently interpreted the new Shari\'a </p><p>laws, most others have interpreted their laws differently and </p><p>have implemented them with moderation.  Additionally, there </p><p>is trend developing among some elements in the Muslim </p><p>community to shift focus from  the criminal law aspects of </p><p>Shari\'a law to its  tenets of social justice and charity for </p><p>the poor.   Islamic scholars and many Muslim lawyers are </p><p>educating the poor and the less well informed about their </p><p>procedural rights under Shari\'a.  Several lawyers offer pro </p><p>bono services to the indigent in cases where the potential </p><p>punishment might be severe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section III: Societal Attitudes </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious differences often correlate to regional and ethnic </p><p>differences.  For example, the North, including part of the </p><p>Middle Belt, is overwhelmingly Muslim and the large Hausa and </p><p>Fulani ethnic groups tend to dominate these  areas. Most </p><p>southern ethnic groups are predominantly Christian. </p><p>Consequently it is often difficult to distinguish between </p><p>religious conflict and discrimination, and ethnic conflict </p><p>and discrimination.  It is not unusual for two ethnic groups </p><p>with a long history of conflict to adopt different religions, </p><p>thereby placing a religious overlay atop tensions that </p><p>originally arose from ethnic confrontation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the weekend of September 7, violence erupted in </p><p>Jos that eventually claimed more than 2300 lives.  It is </p><p>unclear how the unrest began, but tensions had risen over the </p><p>appointment of an ethnic Hausa to the chairmanship of a local </p><p>Poverty Alleviation Program, and earlier violence between </p><p>Christian Sayewa and Muslim Hausa-Fulani in Tafawa Balewa, </p><p>Bauchi, only 60 kilometers away. Reliable sources indicate </p><p>that most of the casualties were Hausa-Fulani Muslims, who </p><p>constitute a significant minority in Jos.  The military was </p><p>able to restore order, but thousands of Hausas fled Plateau </p><p>state for Kaduna, Kano, Jigawa and Bauchi.  This conflict </p><p>appears to have been primarily ethnic, and secondarily </p><p>religious.  Christians of different sects were reported to </p><p>have attacked each other, and Yoruba Muslims reportedly </p><p>joined in attcking their Hausa co-religionists.  The Jos </p><p>conflict produced approximately 11,600 internally displaced </p><p>persons according to the Nigerian Red Cross. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Similarly, in February 2002, violent clashes rocked the </p><p>Idi-Araba area of Lagos as Yoruba youth clashed with Hausa </p><p>residents. The incident was caused by interethnic tensions </p><p>but had some religious overtones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian law prohibits religious discrimination; however, </p><p>private businesses frequently are guilty of informal </p><p>religious and ethnic discrimination in their hiring practices </p><p>and purchasing patterns. In nearly all states, ethnic </p><p>rivalries between majority groups and minority "immigrants" </p><p>lead to some societal discrimination against minority ethnic </p><p>and religious groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Purdah, the Islamic practice of keeping girls and women in </p><p>seclusion from men outside the family, continued among some </p><p>families in some parts of the far North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In many parts of the country, girls are discriminated against </p><p>regarding access to education for social and economic </p><p>reasons, with religious belief sometimes being a factor. </p><p>Girls in the more traditionalist rural areas, both in the </p><p>predominantly Muslim North and the predominantly Christian </p><p>South, are even more disadvantaged than their urban </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section IV: U.S. Government Policy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy officials regularly discussed religious freedom </p><p>issues with various federal, state and local officials. </p><p>Embassy officials raised religious freedom issues with </p><p>government officials in the context of the U.S. Government\'s </p><p>overall dialog and policy of promoting human rights. The U.S. </p><p>Government, through the U.S. Embassy and in statements from </p><p>officials in Washington, sought to encourage a peaceful </p><p>resolution to the Shari\'a issue and urged that human rights </p><p>and religious freedom be respected in any resolution. The </p><p>Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) created programs for </p><p>conflict resolution training that are being continued by the </p><p>U.S. Agency for International Development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In February 2002, the Embassy\'s Public Affairs Section </p><p>sponsored the visit to Nigeria of the Executive Director of </p><p>the American Muslim Council, Aly Abuzaakouk to discuss the </p><p>War Against Terror, religious  tolerance, and the religious </p><p>freedom that Muslims enjoy in the United States. Abuzaakouk </p><p>addressed over 500 Muslims and Christians in Abuja, Ibadan, </p><p>Jos, Lagos, Kaduna and Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy facilitated the visit to Nigeria of former </p><p>President Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates Sr., of the Bill and </p><p>Melinda Gates Foundation, who promoted HIV/AIDS awareness and </p><p>prevention.  President Carter addressed the Presidential </p><p>Chapel at the Sunday service, where he preached a message of </p><p>abstinence and faithfulness as a way to halt the spread of </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In June, 2002 the Embassy\'s Public Affairs Section  sponsored </p><p>the Reverend Eugene Rivers of the Ten Point Coalition, who </p><p>addressed inter-religious groups with his message of </p><p>abstinence and fidelity.  Rivers engaged Muslims and </p><p>Christians in Kaduna and Lagos and challenged them to </p><p>overcome their differences, in order to cooperate in the </p><p>fight against HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
