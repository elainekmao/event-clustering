<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 002233 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT REAP, DS/ATA, L/LEI, IO, SA/RA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PGOV, PREL, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA/MALDIVES:  2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) STATE 210627; (B) STATE 198192 </p><p> </p><p>1.  POST\'S RESPONSE TO REF B REQUEST FOR INPUT FOR THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOLLOWS.  DATA </p><p>ON SRI LANKA IS CONTAINED IN PARA TWO AND DATA ON THE </p><p>MALDIVES IN PARA THREE.  PARAS 2-3 ALSO CONTAIN </p><p>INFORMATION RESPONSIVE TO REF A CONCERNING UPGRADING </p><p>HOST COUNTRY ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DATA ON SRI LANKA FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>SRI LANKA HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE IN THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM.  THERE IS NO INFORMATION THAT </p><p>INDICATES THAT THERE IS ANY RISK THAT GSL COOPERATION </p><p>WILL DECREASE.  THROUGHOUT 2001, THE GSL CONTINUED TO </p><p>BATTLE THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE), THE </p><p>ONLY TERRORIST GROUP CURRENTLY BELIEVED ACTIVE IN SRI </p><p>LANKA.  THE GSL SUFFERED LARGE-SCALE CASUALTIES IN AN </p><p>OFFENSIVE ON LTTE POSITIONS IN NORTHERN SRI LANKA IN </p><p>APRIL.  THE LTTE LAUNCHED A DEVASTATING ATTACK ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND AIRBASE COMPLEX NORTH OF </p><p>COLOMBO IN LATE JULY.  THE LTTE ALSO ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS </p><p>HIT-AND-RUN ATTACKS IN THE NORTH AND EAST THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>YEAR.  IN EARLY NOVEMBER, A SUICIDE BOMBER BLEW HIMSELF </p><p>UP IN DOWNTOWN COLOMBO, KILLING FIVE OTHER PEOPLE. IN </p><p>OCTOBER 2001, THE DEPARTMENT RE-DESIGNATED THE LTTE AS A </p><p>FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996. </p><p>IN LATE OCTOBER 2001, THE LTTE WAS ADDED TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 BLOCKING THE ASSETS OF </p><p>TERRORIST ENTITIES.  BOTH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA </p><p>TOOK STEPS TO BAN LTTE ACTIVITIES IN 2001.  IN NOVEMBER, </p><p>SRI LANKA TOOK STEPS TO IMPLEMENT UNSCR 1333 AND 1373, </p><p>WHICH CALLED FOR U.N. MEMBER-STATES TO FREEZE THE ASSETS </p><p>OF TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE U.S. CONTINUES TO URGE THE </p><p>SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO BECOME A PARTY TO THE REMAINING </p><p>FOUR OF THE 12 INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS IT DOES NOT BELONG TO ALREADY. </p><p> </p><p>(((THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS A </p><p>THROUGH M IN PARA TWO OF REF B.))) </p><p> </p><p>(A) IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATROCITIES, </p><p>THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY DECLARED ITS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>COALITION PARTNERS IN THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  IN NOVEMBER, SRI LANKA TOOK STEPS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT UNSCR 1333 AND 1373, WHICH CALLED FOR U.N. </p><p>MEMBER-STATES TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST </p><p>ENTITIES.  BECAUSE OF THE LONGSTANDING WAR AGAINST THE </p><p>LTTE, THE GSL ALREADY HAD MANY COUNTERTERRORISM LAWS ON </p><p>THE BOOKS.  IN ADDITION, IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, </p><p>INCLUDING AT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE SOUTH ASIAN </p><p>ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC), AND THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH, THE GSL HAD ALREADY PROVEN ACTIVE IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON WAYS TO FIGHT TERRORISM INTERNATIONALLY. </p><p>THERE IS NO INFORMATION THAT INDICATES THAT THERE IS ANY </p><p>RISK THAT GSL COOPERATION WILL DECREASE. </p><p> </p><p>(B) THROUGHOUT 2001, THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT HERALDED </p><p>MANY INSTANCES WHEN PURPORTED LTTE TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>WERE THWARTED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM MOST OF THESE </p><p>GSL CLAIMS.  IN NOVEMBER, HOWEVER, POLICE INTERCEPTED A </p><p>SUICIDE BOMBER IN DOWNTOWN COLOMBO BEFORE HE REACHED HIS </p><p>TARGET.  (NOTE:  THE TARGET COULD HAVE BEEN THEN-PRIME </p><p>MINISTER WICKREMANAYAKE.)  THE SUICIDE BOMBER DID MANAGE </p><p>TO DETONATE HIS BOMB, KILLING FIVE OTHER PEOPLE, </p><p>INCLUDING TWO POLICE OFFICERS.  IN OCTOBER, THE POLICE </p><p>ALSO CLAIM TO HAVE FOUND A "SUICIDE VEST" PACKED WITH </p><p>HIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES IN A LOCAL COLOMBO PARK.  THE GSL </p><p>CLAIMS THAT THIS VEST WAS TO BE USED TO ATTACK PRESIDENT </p><p>KUMARATUNGA. </p><p> </p><p>(C) THE GSL CONDUCTED NO PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 2001.  WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM, THE GSL CONTINUED TO ARREST AND </p><p>DETAIN SUSPECTED OPERATIVES OF THE LTTE.  IN DOING THIS, </p><p>THE GSL RELIED ON THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT (PTA) AND ALSO A 1998 </p><p>BLANKET ACT BANNING LTTE ACTIVITIES.  MANY OF THOSE </p><p>ARRESTED ARE ULTIMATELY CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF THE </p><p>CRIME OF WITHHOLDING INFORMATION.  TO DATE, THE GSL HAS </p><p>NOT APPREHENDED OR PROSECUTED ANY IMPORTANT LTTE </p><p>LEADERS.  LTTE LEADER VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN AND EIGHT </p><p>OTHER LTTE MEMBERS REMAIN INDICTED FOR COMPLICITY IN THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JANUARY 1996 CENTRAL BANK BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>(D) THE GSL DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR. </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID NOT REQUEST ANY EXTRADITIONS OR </p><p>ASK FOR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES.  IN JUNE 1995, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>LTTE LEADER PRABHAKARAN AND TWO OTHER SENIOR LTTE </p><p>OFFICIALS (INTELLIGENCE CHIEF POTTU AMMAN AND WOMEN\'S </p><p>WING LEADER AKILA, ALTHOUGH MOST BELIEVE THE LATTER IS </p><p>DEAD) FOR COMPLICITY IN THE 1991 ASSASSINATION OF RAJIV </p><p>GANDHI.  NO EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEGUN, AND IT </p><p>SEEMS UNLIKELY SECURITY FORCES OR POLICE WILL APPREHEND </p><p>THESE LTTE LEADERS AS EVENTS NOW STAND. </p><p> </p><p>(E) THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT MAKES TERRORISM </p><p>ILLEGAL IN SRI LANKA AND THE GSL PROSCRIBED THE LTTE IN </p><p>1998.  POST HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS </p><p>TO GSL PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  IN FACT, THE SEPTEMBER 1999 SIGNING OF A </p><p>GENERAL EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES </p><p>(RATIFIED BY THE U.S. SENATE IN OCTOBER AND SIGNED BY </p><p>THE PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER 1999), FACILITATED EXTRADITION </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  SRI LANKA HAS SIGNED THE </p><p>1988 SAARC REGIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>TERRORISM, WHICH DESIGNATES CERTAIN ACTS SPECIFICALLY AS </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AND NOT AS POLITICAL ACTS, THEREBY </p><p>NULLIFYING ATTEMPTS BY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO CLAIM </p><p>POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS FOR VIOLENCE.  THE GSL THEREFORE </p><p>SEEMS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE REQUEST FROM INDIA </p><p>FOR THE EXTRADITION OF PRABHAKARAN, THOUGH ITS OWN </p><p>PROSECUTION OF THE LTTE LEADER WOULD LIKELY TAKE </p><p>PRECEDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>(F) AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONSIDERS ITSELF A "FRONT-LINE" STATE IN THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, HAVING BATTLED THE LTTE FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. </p><p>AS PART OF ITS CAMPAIGN TO ISOLATE THE LTTE, THE GSL </p><p>GIVES STRONG SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE TERRORISM PROBLEM, INCLUDING IN THE </p><p>POST-SEPTEMBER 11 TIMEFRAME.  THE GSL CONTINUES TO URGE </p><p>STATES TO TAKE STEPS TO BAN THE LTTE, WHICH THE UNITED </p><p>KINGDOM AND CANADA DID EARLIER THIS YEAR.  THE GSL </p><p>COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN ITS </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE RAJIV GANDHI ASSASSINATION.  SRI </p><p>LANKA REGULARLY CONDEMNS INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>IN OTHER COUNTRIES, HAS SIGNED THE TOKYO, THE HAGUE AND </p><p>MONTREAL CONVENTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM, AND HAS PASSED </p><p>THE NECESSARY ENABLING LEGISLATION FOR ALL THREE </p><p>PROTOCOLS.  SRI LANKA HAS ALSO SIGNED THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PROTOCOL AGAINST BOMBING IN JANUARY 1998.  IN 1997, SRI </p><p>LANKA RATIFIED THE 1988 PROTOCOL FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>UNLAWFUL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AT AIRPORTS SERVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION.  IN ADDITION, IT HAS </p><p>EITHER SIGNED, OR HAS TAKEN THE NECESSARY INTERNAL STEPS </p><p>TO BECOME A SIGNATORY, TO THE 1979 CONVENTION AGAINST </p><p>THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES, THE 1979 CONVENTION ON THE </p><p>PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS, AND THE 1988 </p><p>CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS AGAINST </p><p>THE SAFETY OF MARITIME NAVIGATION.  THOUGH THE GSL HAS </p><p>YET TO RATIFY THE 1991 CONVENTION OF THE MARKING OF </p><p>PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETECTION, THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE GSL WILL CONSIDER BECOMING A SIGNATORY.  THE U.S. </p><p>CONTINUES TO URGE THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO BECOME A </p><p>PARTY TO THE REMAINING FOUR OF THE 12 INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS IT DOES NOT BELONG TO </p><p>ALREADY. </p><p> </p><p>(G) THROUGHOUT 2001, THE GSL CONTINUED TO CONDUCT A </p><p>LARGE-SCALE WAR EFFORT AGAINST THE LTTE.  THIS WAR HAD </p><p>MANY FACETS:  BY CONDUCTING COUNTER-TERRORIST AND </p><p>COUNTER-INSURGENCY OPERATIONS AGAINST THE LTTE, </p><p>INCLUDING MILITARY ACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEASURES TO </p><p>PROTECT URBAN AREAS, IMPORTANT INSTALLATIONS AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT LEADERS, THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO WEAKEN THE </p><p>LTTE AND INHIBIT ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS AS WELL AS MILITARY OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, AS </p><p>REVIEWED ABOVE, SRI LANKA REMAINED ACTIVE IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA AND IN BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS IN </p><p>URGING COUNTRIES TO TAKE STRONG STEPS AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p>SRI LANKA WAS COOPERATIVE IN THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>TIMEFRAME, REPEATEDLY CONDEMNING THE ATROCITIES </p><p>COMMITTED THAT DAY, AND SUPPORTING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORT TO HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE FULLY ACCOUNTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>(H) NOT APPLICABLE - THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>(I) THE GSL HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p>THAT SAID, LARGELY BECAUSE OF ITS "NON-ALIGNED" STATUS, </p><p>SRI LANKA HAS NOT PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF CUBA, IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN, OR SYRIA. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, ITS CONDEMNATION OF ANTI-ISRAELI </p><p>TERRORISM, SUCH AS THAT CARRIED OUT BY HAMAS AND ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD, IS RELATIVELY MUTED. </p><p> </p><p>(J) THERE WAS NO DISCERNIBLE CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>STRONG ANTI-TERRORISM POSTURE IN 2001.  IF ANYTHING, THE </p><p>EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 ONLY SOLIDIFIED THE GSL VIEW THAT </p><p>TERRORISM IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE </p><p>ADDRESSED THROUGH COHERENT, COORDINATED MULTILATERAL </p><p>EFFORTS.  THE GOVERNMENT VIEWS THE CONTINUING USG </p><p>DESIGNATION OF THE LTTE AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION AS POSITIVE, AND THE RECENT ACTIONS BY THE </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA BANNING LTTE ACTIVITIES AS </p><p>BREAKTHROUGHS IN ITS ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>(K) IN THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 ENVIRONMENT, THE U.S. </p><p>HEIGHTENED ITS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE GSL CONCERNING </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL MENACE OF TERRORISM.  IN RESPONSE, SRI </p><p>LANKA WAS COOPERATIVE AND TOOK ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>UNSCR 1333 AND 1373 VIA FREEZING THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST </p><p>ENTITIES.  IN TERMS OF BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>U.S., THE GSL CONTINUES TO ACCEPT U.S. OFFERS OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM </p><p>(ATA).  THREE SEPARATE TRAINING PROGRAMS TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>2001.  THESE INVOLVED: </p><p> </p><p>-- HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION; </p><p> </p><p>-- CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION; AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- SURVEILLANCE DETECTION. </p><p> </p><p>(L-I)  THE GSL CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF U.S. LAW </p><p>BY INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(L-II)  AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE NOT BELIEVED TO BE THE </p><p>PRIMARY TARGET OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SRI LANKA. </p><p>AMCITS, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE </p><p>WRONG TIME, AND HAVE BEEN INJURED IN AT LEAST ONE PAST </p><p>ATTACK:  IN OCTOBER 2000, TWO AMERICANS BYSTANDERS WERE </p><p>INJURED IN A SUICIDE BOMB EXPLOSION IN COLOMBO. </p><p> </p><p>(M) THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SEVERAL REQUESTS TO THE </p><p>GSL FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES FOR U.S. PERSONNEL </p><p>AND FACILITIES IN SRI LANKA.  THE GSL HAS MET ALL </p><p>REQUESTS EXPEDITIOUSLY, INCLUDING IN THE </p><p>POST-SEPTEMBER 11 ATMOSPHERE WHEN THERE WERE SOME ANTI- </p><p>U.S. PROTESTS.  THESE REQUESTS WERE MADE TO ENHANCE </p><p>SECURITY IN GENERAL AND NOT IN RESPONSE TO ANY </p><p>IDENTIFIABLE THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DATA ON THE MALDIVES FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>CONSISTING OF OVER 1,100 ISLANDS SET IN THE INDIAN OCEAN </p><p>WITH A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 270,000, THE REPUBLIC </p><p>OF MALDIVES HAS NO INDIGENOUS TERRORISM PROBLEM AT THIS </p><p>TIME.  THE MALDIVIAN GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TRANSIT OF TERRORISTS </p><p>THROUGH THE COUNTRY (THERE IS NO SOLID EVIDENCE OF THIS) </p><p>AND ALSO OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF SOME HARD-LINE RELIGIOUS </p><p>ELEMENTS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY (SOME OF WHOM HAVE </p><p>BEEN DETAINED).  MALDIVIANS ALSO REMAIN FOCUSED ON </p><p>PREVENTING A REPEAT OF THE EVENTS OF 1988 WHEN A FORMER </p><p>MALDIVIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LAUNCHED A COUP ATTEMPT </p><p>WITH THE HELP OF SRI LANKAN TERRORIST ELEMENTS.  THE </p><p>COUP FAILED DUE TO THE INTERVENTION OF THE INDIAN ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  DESPITE THESE CONCERNS, THE MALDIVES HAS </p><p>EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT IT CAN DEAL WITH POTENTIAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  IN THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE MALDIVES PROVED EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE </p><p>IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION, AND </p><p>REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED THAT DAY. </p><p>IN TERMS OF CONCRETE ACTIONS, THE MALDIVES TOOK </p><p>IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT UNSCR 1333 AND 1337, </p><p>WHICH BLOCKED THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE </p><p>U.S. CONTINUES TO URGE THE MALDIVIAN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>BECOME A PARTY TO THE REMAINING FIVE OF THE 12 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS IT DOES NOT </p><p>BELONG TO ALREADY. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
