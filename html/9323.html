<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001308 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, H, SA/INS </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE AND ASST ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>WCHAMBERLAIN </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD, LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, DOJ FOR DEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, EAID, PREL, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: TIBETAN REFUGEES AND U.S. INTERESTS - </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1247 (B) KATHMANDU 1239 (C) </p><p>     KATHMANDU 1219 (D) KATHMANDU 1133 (E) </p><p>     KATHMANDU 1132 (F) KATHMANDU 1044 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Embassy understands that a group of nine congressmen </p><p>who sent a letter on June 19 to the Prime Minister of Nepal </p><p>is now poised to introduce punitive legislation against Nepal </p><p>if the government does not satisfy their ultimatum regarding </p><p>the status of Tibetan refugees in Nepal.  The Embassy feels </p><p>strongly that such an action would be inconsistent with </p><p>broader U.S. interests in Nepal.  Moreover, on July 11, </p><p>Samdhonje Rinpoche, the Prime Minister of the Tibetan </p><p>Government in Exile in Dharamsala, informed the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>representative in Nepal that punitive legislation against </p><p>Nepal would not support Tibetan objectives.  The Embassy </p><p>believes it is important that the Department contact these </p><p>congressmen on July 11 and make the following points. </p><p> </p><p>2. -- TIBETAN COMMUNITY IN NEPAL -- </p><p> </p><p>-- Since 1959, Nepal has become the home and sanctuary for </p><p>over 20,000 Tibetans.  The Tibetan community in Nepal lives </p><p>in peace and prosperity with a standard of living higher than </p><p>that of most native Nepalese.  Tibetan culture and religion </p><p>have thrived and propagated in Nepal over the past four </p><p>decades, as demonstrated by the great increase in the number </p><p>of monasteries. </p><p> </p><p>-- Since 1990, according to the Dalai Lama\'s office in Nepal, </p><p>the Government of Nepal has assisted over 28,000 undocumented </p><p>Tibetans transiting Nepal on their way to Dharamsala in </p><p>northern India.  In violation of Nepal\'s immigration laws, </p><p>the GON has treated the transiting Tibetans with special </p><p>consideration in accordance with a gentleman\'s agreement with </p><p>UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>-- Recently, the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu has increased </p><p>pressure on the GON to circumscribe the activities of </p><p>Tibetans and complicate the transit of Tibetans to India.  As </p><p>a result of this pressure and despite vigorous complaints by </p><p>the Embassy and other international agencies, 18 Tibetans </p><p>were deported to China on May 31. </p><p> </p><p>-- Since then, the Embassy repeatedly has raised the issue </p><p>with the Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Prime Minister </p><p>and King.  The Prime Minister assured the Ambassador that GON </p><p>policy toward transiting Tibetans had not changed and that in </p><p>the future transiting Tibetans will be handed over, as </p><p>before, to UNHCR (Ref A).  On June 30, King Gyanendra </p><p>apologized for the deportation and said the deportation was </p><p>an aberration that does not reflect official policy (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-- Since the deportation, the GON has granted exit permits </p><p>for three busloads of 115 Tibetans to travel to India.  On </p><p>June 29, the GON also released to UNHCR 19 Tibetans who had </p><p>been detained because they lacked documentation (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>-- Most significantly, the Dalai Lama\'s representative in </p><p>Nepal and Tibetan Prime Minister Samdhonje Rinpoche have </p><p>agreed that punitive legislation against Nepal is not in the </p><p>interests of the Tibetan community and not an objective of </p><p>the Dalai Lama\'s government-in-exile. </p><p> </p><p>-- The withdrawal of U.S. assistance to Nepal, by taking </p><p>resources away from ordinary people and weakening the GON\'s </p><p>hand in dealing with Maoist insurgents, could have the </p><p>reverse affect of hurting the Tibetan community in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. -- BROADER U.S. INTERESTS -- </p><p> </p><p>-- Since 1951, over $700 million in U.S. development </p><p>assistance has made major contributions toward the </p><p>development of Nepal\'s infrastructure, health and legal </p><p>systems, as well as important steps in building institutions </p><p>for Nepal\'s fledgling democracy.  Progress has been made in </p><p>decreasing child mortality and fertility rates and </p><p>substantial gains in literacy and food security. </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S. has helped and continues to help Nepal fight the </p><p>Maoist insurgency, which is a direct threat to the country\'s </p><p>young democracy.  The Maoists continue to systematically </p><p>harass, extort from and abduct ordinary Nepalese despite a </p><p>cease-fire and code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON cooperates with the U.S. on counter-narcotics. </p><p>With the growing incidence of Nepalese participating in </p><p>international drug trafficking, cooperation between the GON </p><p>and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency will becoming </p><p>increasingly important (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON cooperates with the U.S. on counter-terrorism.  In </p><p>March, the GON and U.S. signed an anti-terrorism agreement </p><p>committing the GON to work with the U.S. on fighting global </p><p>terrorism.  Also, two Royal Nepal Army officers are now </p><p>visiting CENTCOM in Florida to discuss the deployment of </p><p>Nepalese soldiers to help U.S. peacekeeping operations in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON also cooperates with the U.S. in combating </p><p>trafficking in women and children.  The 2002 U.S. Annual </p><p>Trafficking in Persons Report cited as a "best practice" the </p><p>progress the GON has made in stemming the illegal flow of </p><p>Nepalese women and children at the border crossings between </p><p>Nepal and India. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON also cooperates with the U.S. in removing the </p><p>worst forms of child labor.  Within the first year, U.S. </p><p>programs in Nepal will have reached over 15,000 children at </p><p>risk and provided direct support to over 1,500 children </p><p>working in the garment industry, domestic service, as miners </p><p>and porters, enabling them to attend school. </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S. is also ramping up efforts to strengthen </p><p>anti-corruption efforts, enhance judicial administration and </p><p>increase access to justice for the poor and disenfranchised. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: In sum, the Embassy strongly believes that </p><p>punitive legislation against Nepal, cutting off security and </p><p>other valuable assistance because of the Tibetan issue would </p><p>undermine broader U.S. objectives in the region.  Moreover, </p><p>the Tibetan leadership itself does not support legislation </p><p>that would cut U.S. assistance to Nepal.  Post urges the </p><p>Department to convey these sentiments to the nine congressmen </p><p>as soon as possible.  With continued assistance, the U.S. can </p><p>remain the most active and influential force working in Nepal </p><p>in defense of Tibetan political and human rights.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
