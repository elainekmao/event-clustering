<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SOCI, PGOV, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GVN CONCERNED OVER VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In a meeting with Charge on March 13, Assistant </p><p>Foreign Minister Nguyen Duc Hung, concurrently Director of </p><p>the MFA\'s America\'s Department, expressed concern that the </p><p>Vietnam Human Rights Act (VHRA) will be reintroduced in the </p><p>U.S. House of Representatives.  Such legislation is "not in </p><p>the interests of either the U.S. or Vietnam and will harm </p><p>the bilateral relationship," Hung stated.  "No one wants a </p><p>repeat of what happened in 2001," he claimed.  Hung also </p><p>predicted that the legislation would lead to "strong </p><p>reactions from the media and the Vietnamese people." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Hung told the Charge that, while the GVN </p><p>understands that this bill represents only a "small minority </p><p>view," it is "counterproductive."  He asked that the Charge </p><p>inform Washington how seriously this bill, if introduced, </p><p>will be viewed in Vietnam.  He urged that the Department </p><p>work against the VHRA reintroduction to avoid a "strong </p><p>reaction" in Vietnam.  In contrast, Hung pointed to the </p><p>success of last week\'s Asia Society conference and how it </p><p>had "done much" to advance "mutual understanding," </p><p>especially with the US business community. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Charge told Hung that he would pass the GVN\'s </p><p>concern to Washington.  He urged Hung to encourage the GVN </p><p>embassy in Washington to increase its outreach efforts to </p><p>the Vietnamese community and others in the U.S.    PORTER </p><p></p></div>
