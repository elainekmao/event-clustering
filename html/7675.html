<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM USMISSION ICAO </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR IO/T, EB/TRA/OTP/AVP </p><p>DOT FOR OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AVIATION </p><p>FAA FOR AIA-100 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ATRN, ICAO, Transportation </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING OF MALIAT PARTIES AT ICAO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A CORRECTED VERSION OF MONTREAL 463 (NOTAL) ADDING </p><p>INFO ADDRESSEES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CABEL AS </p><p>BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  AT A BRIEF LUNCHTIME MEETING ON THE SIDES OF </p><p>THE ICAO 5TH WORLDWIDE AIR TRANSPORT CONFERENCE, </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON </p><p>LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT (MALIAT) </p><p>MEMBER COUNTRIES MET TO DISCUSS WAYS TO INCREASE THE </p><p>AGREEMENT\'S MEMBERSHIP.  CURRENT PROSPECTS ARE SLIM, THE </p><p>GROUP AGREED, WITH TONGA THE ONLY LIKELY CANDIDATE. </p><p>PURSUIT, THEREFORE, OF A CARGO-ONLY ACCESSION OPTION WAS </p><p>AGREED TO BE DESIRABLE, AND THE U.S. COMMITTED TO PROVIDE TO </p><p>THE PARTNER COUNTRIES TEXT OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE MALIAT </p><p>THAT WOULD ALLOW SUCH ACCESSION. IN DISCUSSION OF </p><p>TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, PARTIES AGREED THAT SUCH </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE OF LIMITED DURATION LEADING TO FULL </p><p>MEMBERSHIP, AND ARE MOST PRACTICALLY PURSUED ON AN AD HOC, </p><p>BILATERAL BASIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT PROSPECTS FEW </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. AT A MEETING HELD ON THE SIDELINES OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION\'S (ICAO) 5TH WORLDWIDE AIR </p><p>TRANSPORT CONFERENCE IN MONTREAL, THE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AIR TRANSPORT (MALIAT) REVIEWED THEIR OUTREACH TO VARIOUS </p><p>POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR ACCESSION TO THE MALIAT.  SOME </p><p>CANDIDATES - U.A.E., OMAN, SRI LANKA, THE COOK ISLANDS, AND </p><p>TONGA WERE MENTIONED - BUT OF THIS GROUP, IT APPEARED THAT </p><p>ONLY TONGA HAD EXPRESSED SERIOUS INTEREST. NOTE: IN A </p><p>SEPARATE DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S. HEAD OF DELEGATION, THE </p><p>CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE FROM TONGA, WHO WAS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE ICAO MEETING, INDICATED THAT HIS COUNTRY WOULD BE </p><p>TAKING A SERIOUS LOOK AT MALIAT MEMBERSHIP. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3. AS THE GROUP BRAINSTORMED, CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO </p><p>POTENTIAL CANDIDATES IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  PERU AND CHILE, </p><p>HOWEVER, NOTED THAT THEY HAVE FEW OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS IN </p><p>THIS REGION AND THAT MOST CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS ARE </p><p>AFRAID OF THEIR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH, PARTICULARLY CHILE. </p><p>THEY ARE THEREFORE UNLIKELY TO GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO </p><p>MALIAT ACCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>CARGO-ONLY PROSPECTS MORE PROMISING </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LIST OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES GREW LONGER WHEN </p><p>DISCUSSION OF A CARGO-ONLY ACCESSION WAS RAISED.  ALL </p><p>MEMBERS SUPPORTED IN PRINCIPLE THE CONCEPT OF AMENDING THE </p><p>MALIAT TO ALLOW SUCH ACCESSION, AND ALL EXPRESSED INTEREST </p><p>IN REVIEWING AMENDMENT LANGUAGE PROMISED BY THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THE U.S. EXPLAINED THAT THE USG INTERNALLY HAD BEEN </p><p>WRESTLING WITH WHETHER TO INCLUDE BELLY CARGO IN THE </p><p>AMENDMENT, AND HAD FINALLY DECIDED TO DO SO.  THERE WAS SOME </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THIS APPROACH, AND ALSO </p><p>OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING CLEAR HOW A CARGO-ONLY MALIAT </p><p>WOULD APPLY IN PARALLEL TO PASSENGER BILATERALS, BUT MOST </p><p>WISHED TO RESERVE COMMENT UNTIL SEEING THE U.S. DRAFT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE CANDIDATES FOR FULL ACCESSION LISTED ABOVE WERE </p><p>VIEWED AS MORE LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR A CARGO-ONLY ACCESSION. </p><p>OTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATES INCLUDED PAKISTAN, WITH WHOM THE </p><p>U.S. HAS OPEN SKIES, THAILAND, WHICH HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST </p><p>IN ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL CARGO HUB, AND AUSTRALIA, WHICH </p><p>HAS NO SIGNIFICANT CARGO CARRIERS OF ITS OWN AND WITH WHOM </p><p>MOST MALIAT MEMBERS ALREADY HAVE CARGO OPEN SKIES.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, CHILE AND PERU NOTED THAT THEY BOTH HAVE OPEN </p><p>CARGO AGREEMENTS WITH ARGENTINA, AS DOES THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>TAIWAN, DUE TO ITS UNIQUE POLITICAL STATUS, WAS ALSO </p><p>MENTIONED AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE. </p><p> </p><p>6. IT WAS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT BEFORE A FINAL APPROVAL OF ANY </p><p>CARGO-ONLY AMENDMENT, THAT AMENDMENT SHOULD BE SHARED WITH </p><p>POTENTIAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT IT MIGHT BE ATTRACTIVE TO </p><p>THEM.  SOME MEMBERS EXPRESSED A DISINCLINATION TO AMEND THE </p><p>MALIAT WITHOUT THE HIGH PROBABILITY OF AN ACCESSION </p><p>CANDIDATE. </p><p> </p><p>TRANSITIONAL AGREEMENTS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. IT WAS GENERALLY AGREED THAT ANY TRANSITIONAL MEASURES </p><p>SHOULD BE JUST THAT - LEADING ULTIMATELY TO FULL MEMBERSHIP </p><p>- AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PERMANENT "LEVELS" OR </p><p>"CATEGORIES" OF MEMBERSHIP WITHIN THE MALIAT (OTHER THAN THE </p><p>CARGO-ONLY OPTION DISCUSSED ABOVE).  FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS </p><p>LARGELY FELT THAT TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE ON AN </p><p>AD HOC, BILATERAL BASIS WHERE THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS OF A </p><p>POTENTIAL ENTRANT COULD BE ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>PERU AND CHILE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF THE CURRENT THREAT BY PERU TO </p><p>WITHDRAW FROM THE MALIAT.  BOTH DELEGATIONS WERE RELATIVELY </p><p>SILENT DURING THE MEETING, ALTHOUGH CHILE\'S REMARKS ON THE </p><p>UNDESIRABILITY OF TRANSITIONS SEEMED AIMED AT THEIR PERUVIAN </p><p>COUNTERPARTS.  DURING THE CONFERENCE, U.S. DELEGATION </p><p>MEMBERS SPOKE SEPARATELY WITH PERU AND CHILE ABOUT THEIR </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IN THE MALIAT, AND BOTH EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT </p><p>THE U.S. WOULD INVOLVE ITSELF IN HELPING THEM TO RESOLVE </p><p>THEIR DIFFERENCES.  FOR ITS SIDE, CHILE WAS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>ANY SEPARATE, TRANSITIONAL AGREEMENT WITH PERU BE OPEN TO </p><p>THE SCRUTINY OF OTHER MALIAT MEMBERS, SO THAT PERU FEELS </p><p>GREATER PRESSURE TO MAKE THE EVENTUAL TRANSITION TO FULL </p><p>MEMBERSHIP.  PERU FOR ITS PART EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER THE APPROVAL OF OTHER MALIAT MEMBERS WAS REQUIRED </p><p>BEFORE ANY AD HOC BILATERAL AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE FORCE.  IN </p><p>BOTH CASES, U.S. DELEGATION MEMBERS MADE CLEAR THAT, WHILE </p><p>THE U.S. WAS HAPPY TO OFFER ASSISTANCE, ANY SOLUTION LIES </p><p>WITH PERU AND CHILE TO RESOLVE BILATERALLY. </p><p>PRICE KANTER </p><p></p></div>
