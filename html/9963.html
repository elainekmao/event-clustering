<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 005006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: AFTERMATH OF ATTACK ON JORDAN\'S EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge d\'Affaires David Hale, for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) Charge spoke to Prime Minister Abul Ragheb and </p><p>Foreign Minister Muasher on August 7 to convey our </p><p>condolences and sympathies for the losses and injuries </p><p>suffered in the attack on Jordan\'s Baghdad Embassy.  Both </p><p>stressed in the course of the day their gratitude for U.S. </p><p>and CPA action on the ground to shelter and transport the </p><p>survivors and protect the bombed facility.  Both emphasized </p><p>the importance of continued protection of the building by </p><p>U.S. personnel to prevent looting, which would leave a very </p><p>damaging image in the Arab world.  Similar messages have been </p><p>conveyed from senior GOJ officials via ROAL channels.  Post </p><p>will continue to work with CPA on this issue, including in </p><p>defining an end point when such protection will no longer be </p><p>required. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Abul Ragheb and Muasher both asked for a rapid </p><p>investigation to undercover the culprits.  Amman is awash in </p><p>rumors about the origin of the attack.  Rumored culprits </p><p>range from pro-Saddam figures enraged by Jordan\'s support for </p><p>the coalition, to anti-Saddam figures seeking retribution for </p><p>Jordan\'s past association and provoked by Jordan\'s recent </p><p>harboring of Saddam\'s daughters.  Some commentators have even </p><p>pointed fingers at Ahmad Chalabi, for his alleged </p><p>anti-Jordanian bias.  Soberer security contacts are focusing </p><p>on known terrorist linkages between Jordan and Iraq, with an </p><p>established record of attacks here. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SEPTEL reports EAC meeting. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
