(SBU)  SUMMARY:  Deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini </p><p>and Members of the Italian Parliament told CODEL Hyde that </p><p>improving the transatlantic relationship was a priority for </p><p>the Italian EU Presidency.  Fini said that the GOI recognizes </p><p>and appreciates the sacrifices America has made to preserve </p><p>freedom in Europe, and believes the EU and the US need close </p><p>cooperation to prevent the spread of WMD. He said that the </p><p>GOI wants to overcome differences on biotech issues during </p><p>its Presidency, and said patent protection is crucial to </p><p>fueling continued investment and wealth creation.  MPs </p><p>stressed development of a European Procurement Agency as a </p><p>longer-term goal to achieve a common market for military </p><p>research, development and procurement, increasing efficiency </p><p>and economies of scale.   Italy is aware of the need to </p><p>confront rogue states that support terrorism and jeopardize </p><p>international peace.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  From June 27 through July 2, a Congressional </p><p>Delegation led by HIRC Chairman Henry Hyde visited Rome for </p><p>Transatlantic Legislature Dialogue (TLD) meetings with </p><p>Members of the European Parliament, and meetings with GOI </p><p>officials to discuss GOI priorities for the Italian EU </p><p>Presidency and bilateral economic and Political issues. </p><p>(SEPTELS report TLD and economic bilateral meetings). </p><p>Ambassador Sembler accompanied the CODEL to the meetings with </p><p>Fini and the Italian Parliament.  CODEL members joining </p><p>Chairman Hyde in the meetings with Fini and MPs were: Reps Jo </p><p>Ann Davis, Henry Waxman, John Mica, Phil English, Ed </p><p>Whitfield, Randy Forbes, Diane Watson, Katherine Harris, </p><p>Thaddeus G. McCotter, and Candice Miller. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Deputy PM Fini opened the July 1 meeting with a </p><p>warm welcome to Chairman Hyde and other delegates.  Noting </p><p>Italy\'s assumption of the EU Presidency was to begin that </p><p>day, Fini offered a sketch of the GOI\'s priorities. </p><p>Improving the transatlantic relationship is a top priority, </p><p>and Italy recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices America </p><p>has made preserving freedom in Europe.  During its six-month </p><p>Presidency the GOI hopes to guide the EU towards continued </p><p>partnership with the U.S., not rivalry. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Fini made clear the EU had a responsibility, and </p><p>the ability, to fight the GWOT alongside the U.S.  He agreed </p><p>with the need to improve aviation security.  Fini believes </p><p>the EU and the U.S. need close cooperation to prevent the </p><p>spread of nuclear arms, and promised the GOI would focus on </p><p>encouraging the EU to pursue additional inspections in Iran </p><p>and provide aid to countries that cooperate in halting WMD </p><p>proliferation.  In the war on drugs Italy stands shoulder to </p><p>shoulder with the U.S., and is the second largest contributor </p><p>to UN anti-drug efforts after the United States.  Fini did </p><p>caution that foreign policy choices often have adverse </p><p>consequences, pointing out the rapid rise in opium production </p><p>that followed the Taliban\'s fall. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  On IPR, Fini underscored his support for the </p><p>initiatives of Minister of Productive Activities Marzano, and </p><p>said that patent protection is crucial to fueling continued </p><p>investment and wealth creation.  He acknowledged that the </p><p>fight against world hunger and poverty could be won with the </p><p>assistance of biotech and GMOs.  The GOI wants to work </p><p>towards overcoming differences on biotech issue during its </p><p>Presidency, but the issue might be one where friends should </p><p>agree to disagree.  Fini agreed hydrogen fuel cells were </p><p>potentially useful if they raise the quality of life, but </p><p>expressed concern that governments not ignore potential </p><p>negative effects on auto workers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Just prior to ending their meeting, Chairman Hyde </p><p>thanked the GOI for its cooperation in the Middle East, </p><p>noting with gratitude that PM Berlusconi did not meet with </p><p>Arafat on a recent Middle East visit.  Fini said the GOI </p><p>considers the success of the roadmap critical to the peace </p><p>process and hopes the Quartet will continue to play a key </p><p>role.  Palestinian PM Abu Mazen was invited to Rome in July, </p><p>and Fini mentioned a possible peace conference in Sicily </p><p>during the fall. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Immediately following the Fini meeting, the CODEL </p><p>met Chamber Defense Committee Chair Luigi Ramponi, Foreign </p><p>Affairs Vice Chair Dario Rivolta, and the Chamber\'s Alternate </p><p>Representative to the European Convention (and ranking </p><p>opposition member on the Foreign Affairs Committee) Valdo </p><p>Spini. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Defense Chairman Ramponi (a member of the second </p><p>party in the governing coalition, National Alliance, AN) </p><p>emphasized development of Europe\'s self-defense capability, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>increased defense spending (within economic realities), using </p><p>the entry of the ten new EU members to improve Europe\'s </p><p>defense, and coordination of European defense against </p><p>terrorism.  The latter, he noted, should rely not only on </p><p>military means, but even more on integrating intelligence and </p><p>law enforcement capabilities of all partners.  Ramponi also </p><p>stressed development of a European Procurement Agency as a </p><p>longer-term goal to achieve a common market for military </p><p>research, development and procurement, increasing efficiency </p><p>and economies of scale.  Ramponi urged the delegation to note </p><p>Italy\'s extensive support for international peacekeeping </p><p>operations (which they did in their responses and questions), </p><p>despite budgetary limitations and domestic political </p><p>pressures.  "We\'re with you in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in </p><p>Kosovo, and elsewhere," Ramponi said, "despite our admittedly </p><p>low spending on defense." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Cong. Forbes sought Ramponi\'s evaluation of the </p><p>implications of U.S. force transformation in Europe.  Ramponi </p><p>acknowledged that different threats in Europe after the Cold </p><p>War could justify a reduction and relocation in U.S. forces. </p><p>"I would understand if you must reduce and would not think </p><p>you are abandoning Europe politically," he said. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Cong. Harris praised the reconstruction </p><p>contributions of smaller, specialized Italian teams in </p><p>Afghanistan and asked for further contributions of small </p><p>teams to security outside Kabul.  She asked for clarification </p><p>on the GOI request that the USG confirm that the 173rd </p><p>Airborne had parachuted into a permissive environment in </p><p>northern Iraq in the first week of Operation Iraqi Freedom; </p><p>what did this imply for future cooperation?  Ramponi was </p><p>pleased with the recognition of Italy\'s specialized </p><p>contributions.  Outlining Italy\'s on-going contributions in </p><p>Afghanistan, however, he implied further concurrent </p><p>involvement was unlikely.  He suggested that involvement </p><p>outside Kabul would require a new UN decision.  He explained </p><p>some of the political pressure on the GOI during the Iraq </p><p>war; it had requested confirmation of the 173rd\'s mission in </p><p>order to defuse opposition allegations that the GOI had lied </p><p>about use of Italian territory to launch military strikes </p><p>against Iraq.  Ambassador Sembler clarified the </p><p>constitutional restrictions under which Italy had operated. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Rivolta ( foreign affairs spokesman for PM </p><p>Berlusconi\'s Forza Italia (FI) party) highlighted Italy\'s </p><p>pride at being a "special friend" of the U.S., adding that </p><p>Italy cannot see a Europe that does not cooperate closely </p><p>with the U.S.  Even in France and Germany, politicians know </p><p>that the future of Europe is with the United States.  Europe </p><p>can be a stronger and better partner to the U.S. if it is </p><p>united, Rivolta continued.  Coordinating, rather than </p><p>duplicating, will allow Europe to increase its defense </p><p>spending as the U.S. has requested.  Italy is aware of the </p><p>need to confront rogue states that support terrorism and </p><p>jeopardize international peace.  Together, we can defeat </p><p>their weapons, but, Rivolta added, we must also defeat the </p><p>sympathy some feel toward those who engage in terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Cong. Miller asked if possible American force </p><p>restructuring in Europe would be perceived as retaliation, </p><p>particularly if troops in Germany and France were reduced. </p><p>Admitting that it was difficult for him to evaluate German or </p><p>French reaction, Rivolta opined that if such a change </p><p>occurred now, it could be perceived as a rupture.  Cong. </p><p>Watson asked Rivolta to elaborate on Italy\'s relations with </p><p>Syria and Iran.  Rivolta suggested Italy\'s continued dialogue </p><p>with Syria might bring Damascus closer to U.S. (and Western) </p><p>views.  Iran was a tougher case.  He had hoped for a quicker, </p><p>easier transformation there. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Cong. Tancredo asked if Italy shared U.S. </p><p>concerns on human trafficking; how could we ensure more </p><p>aggressive prosecution of perpetrators?  Rivolta replied that </p><p>Italy is particularly exposed to the evils of trafficking </p><p>with its huge coastline.  He explained Italy\'s overall </p><p>concerns with immigration and trafficking, noting their </p><p>importance in Italy\'s EU Presidency program.  He mentioned </p><p>the discussion of whether to assist Libya with its ability to </p><p>interdict illegal immigration flows by relaxing the embargo </p><p>against Qaddafi. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Spini (member of opposition Democrats of the </p><p>Left, DS) highlighted the critical importance of the </p><p>Berlin-Plus agreement, noting it was yet to be resolved </p><p>whether the EU or NATO would authorize use of the </p><p>60,000-person Rapid Reaction Force.  Practically, he </p><p>observed, it would have to be NATO, although not all European </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>nations would agree.  Spini expressed optimism that </p><p>differences over the Iraq war would lead to new understanding </p><p>and cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Cong. Harris asked about new members\' ability to </p><p>enforce immigration policy.  Spini emphasized the importance </p><p>of European integration in diminishing tensions from </p><p>formerly-disputed borders between now-united nations.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked Spini if the opposition supported PM </p><p>Berlusconi\'s calls to expand the EU to Russia and Israel. </p><p>No, Spini replied -- closer association with Russia, </p><p>especially through NATO, was important, but Russia\'s economy </p><p>is too different and too large to permit incorporation into </p><p>the EU at this time.  Turning to Turkey\'s possible entry to </p><p>the EU, Spini said there were advantages and disadvantages to </p><p>the entry of the first Muslim country to a currently </p><p>Christian Union.  For Israel, he urged involvement through a </p><p>strong Mediterranean relationship now, with closer </p><p>association after peace. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) The CODEL did not clear this telegram prior to </p><p>departing Rome. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03200 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
