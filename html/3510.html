<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SFRC STAFFER TALWAR\'S MEETING WITH FM MUASHER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Foreign Minister Muasher met with the DCM, Poloff, and </p><p>SFRC Staffer Puneet Talwar on August 13.  Most of the </p><p>discussion revolved around the MEPP and Iraq.  FM Muasher </p><p>applauded the U.S. commitment to a three-year time-frame for </p><p>a Palestinian state, but urged that the U.S. come up with a </p><p>plan of action on how to achieve it.  Muasher appeared to </p><p>expect a U.S. action against Iraq, and while emphasizing the </p><p>uncertainities and risks for Jordan, said "this is not 1990," </p><p>and pointed out the importance of the U.S. relationship for </p><p>Jordanians.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MEPP: WE NEED A ROAD MAP </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The President\'s June 24 speech changed the landscape, </p><p>according to Muasher, and the GOJ viewed the 3-year </p><p>time-frame in the speech positively.  The GOJ\'s diplomatic </p><p>efforts now are focused on pressing for a plan of action to </p><p>reach that goalpost.   Muasher said the Jordanians were </p><p>reassured during the King\'s visit by the President\'s </p><p>reiteration of the U.S. commitment to the three-year </p><p>time-frame beginning on June 24.  The Jordanians in </p><p>Washington had also stressed that the U.S. needed to develop </p><p>a workplan that would tell the Palestinians exactly what lay </p><p>ahead, otherwise average Palestinians would not be engaged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Muasher had some general comments on what the road </p><p>map should include.  First, the three-year time-frame needs </p><p>to be solid.  Muasher pushed the idea of an international </p><p>monitoring group to ensure progress continued.  Second, </p><p>Muasher said the settlement needed to be comprehensive and </p><p>include solutions for Syria and Lebanon.  The Syria/Lebanon </p><p>tracks did not have to begin at the same time or move at the </p><p>same pace as the Palestinian track.  Muasher understood the </p><p>importance of dealing with the Palestinian issue first, but </p><p>"by the end of the three years, there needs to be Syrian and </p><p>Lebanese solutions as well". </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SAUDIS IN FOREFRONT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Muasher stressed the importance of Saudi engagement. </p><p>"This time they are following up, they are pressing people, </p><p>convincing the Syrians to cooperate...they are playing a much </p><p>more active role than the Egyptians."  When asked about the </p><p>Egyptians, Muasher said confidentially that "in the end, they </p><p>go along with the Jordanian and Saudi ideas, but they have no </p><p>ideas of their own, they have no clear idea on how to move </p><p>forward." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ARAFAT: GIVE THE PEOPLE A REAL CHOICE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) When asked about Arafat, Muasher expressed his </p><p>frustration with the Palestinian leader.  "We are all </p><p>frustrated with Arafat...he has not accepted change or the </p><p>need to evolve."  Although Muasher agreed in principle to the </p><p>need for reform of the Palestinian leadership, he thought the </p><p>U.S. approach was a bit heavy-handed.  Muasher encouraged the </p><p>U.S. to reinforce the three-year timeline with a road map and </p><p>present it in clear terms for the Palestinians--what will it </p><p>be, a state in three years or Arafat?  Given the choice--with </p><p>a clearly defined path to a Palestinian state--Muasher </p><p>believed the Palestinians would choose a state.  But without </p><p>such a road map, people would be reluctant to speak or act </p><p>against Arafat, lest they be branded traitors.   If there is </p><p>only a promise of additional negotiations for a state, then </p><p>the Palestinian people have nothing to gain from removing </p><p>Arafat.  Although Muasher thought it was imperative for the </p><p>Palestinians to do more on security issues, he was very </p><p>encouraged by financial reform. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>GOJ-ISRAEL TIES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) When asked about the Jordanian-Israeli bilateral </p><p>relationship, Muasher said that there had been little </p><p>movement in the relationship or useful diplomatic contact </p><p>with the Israeli government in recent months.  The Jordanians </p><p>still talk to Ben Eliezer, but the relationship with Peres </p><p>has weakened.  Muasher opined that the Labor party was in </p><p>complete disarray.  "Ben Eliezer will tell you things at </p><p>variance with Sharon, and Peres will tell you things at </p><p>variance with his own party."  Muasher said improvement in </p><p>the relationship had to be reciprocal.  "If we returned our </p><p>Ambassador to Tel Aviv without any Israeli action, then </p><p>people would see the normalization steps as further </p><p>capitulation to Israel without anything in return.  But if we </p><p>sent back our Ambassador, and the Israelis did something in </p><p>kind, that would mean something." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ: RESIGNATION AND CONCERN </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) While Muasher confirmed the GOJ public stance that </p><p>Jordan "will not invade Iraq" (i.e., take a direct role in </p><p>the attack), he stressed that the Jordan of 2002 was not the </p><p>Jordan of 1990.  "We have a strong strategic relationship </p><p>with the U.S. that we will not jeopardize."  At the same </p><p>time, Muasher said the GOJ cannot afford to take a public </p><p>stance against Iraq.  "I don\'t think the U.S. will ask us </p><p>things that we cannot deliver; on the other hand, we don\'t </p><p>want to put the U.S. in a difficult position."  Muasher </p><p>underscored the negative economic consequences for Jordan of </p><p>an attack and reiterated the GOJ expectation that the U.S. </p><p>will help Jordan in the short term.  Muasher said the length </p><p>of any offensive would be critical.  "Bombing civilians for </p><p>two weeks will be much different than if the campaign went on </p><p>for six months.  This is not 1990...people are not concerned </p><p>about Saddam, but the Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Mr. Talwar did not have an opportunity to clear this </p><p>message bbefore departing Jordan. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
