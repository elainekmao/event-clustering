(C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWE HAS CHANGED FOREVER AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE RECENT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION THAT BROADENED </p><p>PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY.  THE "LOSERS" IN </p><p>THIS ELECTION, THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC), WILL TAKE THEIR ELECTORAL GRIEVANCES TO </p><p>COURT, NOT THE STREET, THUS MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE.  WE EXPECT IT WILL PLAY THE ROLE </p><p>OF VOCAL OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT AND ATTEMPT TO SHIFT </p><p>THE FOCUS OF THE DEBATE THERE TO THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>FOUNDERING ECONOMY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE IS IN CRUSADE MODE </p><p>AND WILL LEAD HIS RADICALIZED PARTY IN SEARCH OF THE </p><p>HOLY GRAIL OF LAND REDISTRIBUTION.  WE THINK HE VIEWS </p><p>THE MDC\'S SHOWING IN THE POLLS AS A SETBACK FROM WHICH </p><p>HE MUST REGROUP WITH A VIEW TO RUNNING AGAIN IN 2002 </p><p>AGAINST MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN IN ZIMBABWE AND ELECTED A </p><p>NEW PARLIAMENT WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED 57 SEATS FOR AN </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>(MDC).  IN THE CONTEXT OF AFRICA IN GENERAL, THIS IS </p><p>QUITE A REMARKABLE FEAT.  THOUGH THE MDC "LOST" BECAUSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03521  01 OF 02  281310Z </p><p>IT GOT A FEWER NUMBER OF SEATS THAN ZANU-PF AT 62, IT </p><p>MAY ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVED THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES </p><p>CAST.  WE DO NOT, AS A RESULT, EXPECT ITS FOLLOWERS TO </p><p>RESORT TO VIOLENCE IN PROTEST OF A STOLEN ELECTION. </p><p>RATHER, THE MDC IS SET TO CHALLENGE THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>ELECTION VIA RECOUNT DEMANDS AND PERHAPS COURT </p><p>CHALLENGES IN UP TO 20 CONSTITUENCIES.  THE GROUNDS FOR </p><p>THE LEGAL CHALLENGES LIKELY WILL BE PRE-ELECTION AND </p><p>ELECTION DAY INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE, AND VOTERS\' ROLL </p><p>OR PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES THAT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>DISENFRANCHISED MANY INDIVIDUALS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE ELECTION SWEPT OUT A NUMBER OF ZANU-PF </p><p>STALWARTS AND MEMBERS OF THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO, SUCH AS </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER DUMISO DABENGWA, MINES ENVIRONMENT </p><p>AND TOURISM MINISTER S.K. MOYO, ZANU-PF WOMEN\'S LEAGUE </p><p>PRESIDENT TENJIWE LESABE, JUSTICE LEGAL AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, AND A </p><p>MODERATE LIKE MASVINGO PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN DZIKAMAI </p><p>MAVHAIRE.  IT SEATED THE HARD-LINERS IN THE PARTY, SUCH </p><p>AS MASHONALAND CENTRAL GOVERNOR BORDER GEZI; CHEN </p><p>CHIMUTENGWENDE, THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION, POSTS AND </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS; ZANU-PF SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION </p><p>DIDYMUS MUTASA; MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI; AND NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR VETERANS\' </p><p>ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT CHENJERAI HITLER HUNZVI.  THEY </p><p>REPRESENT REMOTE RURAL CONSTITUENCIES WHERE THE MDC HAD </p><p>FEWER POLLING AGENTS AND VOTER INTIMIDATION SEEMS TO </p><p>HAVE WORKED, IN ADDITION TO THE STRATEGIC PLACEMENT OF </p><p>POSTAL VOTES TO SWING KEY OUTCOMES, AS THEY WON BY </p><p>MARGINS THAT DID NOT CONFORM TO THE ESTABLISHED PATTERN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03521  01 OF 02  281310Z </p><p>TOTALLY UNKNOWN NAMES OR INDIVIDUALS WHO PREVIOUSLY </p><p>NEVER DID VERY WELL WON MASSIVELY IN SUCH </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES.  THE SIGNAL BEING SENT BY THESE </p><p>ELECTORAL VICTORIES IS THAT THE ZANU-PF PARTY IS </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY POLARIZED, AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ROOM </p><p>FOR INDEPENDENT BEHAVIOR OR DISSENT.  THE HARD-LINE </p><p>RADICALS NOW HAVE THE UPPER HAND.  IN OUR JUDGMENT </p><p>MUGABE WILL INTERPRET HAVING CLINCHED 62 SEATS THROUGH </p><p>THE FIRST-PAST-THE-POST METHOD AS A CLEAR VICTORY AND </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO GOVERN IN MANNER AS RUTHLESS AS BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE PRESIDENT\'S IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS WILL BE HIS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS 30 PARLIAMENTARIAN APPOINTEES (EIGHT </p><p>ARE THE STANDING GOVERNORS, AND 10 OF THE APPOINTMENTS </p><p>ARE RESERVED FOR TRIBAL CHIEFS, LEAVING 12 PURELY </p><p>"POLITICAL" SLOTS TO BE FILLED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE); </p><p>AND NAMING THE CABINET.  A ZANU-PF CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEETING IS SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 30, REPORTEDLY TO </p><p>DISCUSS THESE ISSUES.  IN APPOINTING THE 12 PARLIAMENT </p><p>MEMBERS, WE EXPECT MUGABE TO RESUSCITATE SOME OF THE </p><p>ELECTION-LOSING FORMER POLITBURO STALWARTS AS EMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA, DUMISO DABENGWA AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>GENDER AFFAIRS OPPAH MUCHINGURI.  ON THE CABINET FRONT </p><p>WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL CONSIST MAINLY OF HARD-LINERS </p><p>FAITHFUL TO MUGABE\'S ARTHRITIC MARXIST IDEOLOGY AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6696 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03521  02 OF 02  281311Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------67EB66  281311Z /38 </p><p>P 281312Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6462 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID, DAA/AFR VERNE NEWTON, AND AFR/SA </p><p>CREINTSMA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03521  02 OF 02  281311Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, PREL, ZI, US </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NEW ZIMBABWEAN PARLIAMENT: THE GLOVES </p><p>WILL BE OFF </p><p> </p><p>LOYAL, BEYOND QUESTION, TO THE OLD MAN AS WELL.  IF, </p><p>CONTRARY TO PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS BY MUGABE\'S </p><p>SUBORDINATES, CABINET SCRAPS ARE THROWN TO THE MDC, THEY </p><p>LIKELY WILL BE POSITIONS HEADING MINISTRIES THAT ARE </p><p>WINDOW DRESSING OR THE MOST PROBLEMATIC, SUCH AS HEALTH </p><p>AND EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUES ON WHICH THE NEW </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WHICH BY OUR READING OF THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>MUST CONVENE FOR ITS FIRST SESSION BY EARLY OCTOBER, IS </p><p>LIKELY TO CLASH IS LAND REDISTRIBUTION, AN ECONOMIC AND </p><p>EMOTIONAL HEAVYWEIGHT.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT MADE IT </p><p>THE HALLMARK OF HIS PARTY\'S ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND </p><p>AMENDED A NUMBER OF STATUTES BY DECREE IN ORDER TO PUT </p><p>IN PLACE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO BEGIN HIS REDISTRIBUTION </p><p>VENTURE.  THE MDC LIKELY WILL DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO </p><p>TRY TO BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THESE ACTIONS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT. AND WE FULLY EXPECT MUGABE WILL RETURN TO </p><p>HIS DIVISIVE AND INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC, CHARACTERIZING </p><p>THE MDC AS A TOOL OF THE WHITES, EX-RHODESIANS, THE </p><p>BRITISH OR WHOMEVER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN HIS CONCILIATORY SPEECH ACCEPTING THE </p><p>ELECTIONS RESULTS THE EVENING OF JUNE 27, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE STATED HIS EXPECTATION THAT PARLIAMENT " IS </p><p>CERTAINLY DESTINED TO PROVE LIVELY" THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03521  02 OF 02  281311Z </p><p>WE CONCUR; AND PREDICT THAT THE MDC WILL BE A VERY VOCAL </p><p>OPPOSITION, CALLING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, COMMON SENSE AND </p><p>RATIONALITY FROM GOVERNMENT.  THE MDC WILL ALSO ATTEMPT </p><p>TO RAISE THE ECONOMY TO BE THE FOCUS OF DEBATE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  OF COURSE, THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT </p><p>ITS PARLOUS STATE WILL REST WITH MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>REPACKAGED GANG OF THIEVES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE THINK MUGABE SEES THE MDC\'S GAINS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT NOT AS DEFEAT BUT A REBUFF FROM WHICH HE MUST </p><p>REGROUP, MUCH AS HE DID AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM IN FEBRUARY.  INSTEAD OF FOUR </p><p>MONTHS HE WILL HAVE NEARLY TWO YEARS TO LAY THE </p><p>GROUNDWORK FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN </p><p>2002, IN WHICH WE EXPECT HE WILL RUN AGAINST THE MDC\'S </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  MUGABE WILL BE IN FULL CRUSADE MODE, </p><p>LEADING THE RULING PARTY ON ITS QUEST FOR THE HOLY GRAIL </p><p>OF LAND REFORM.  REINFORCING THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT IN </p><p>HIS SENSE THAT HE IS ABSOLUTELY ON THE CORRECT PATH IS </p><p>THE UNQUESTIONING ENDORSEMENT OF HIS FELLOW HEADS OF </p><p>STATE FROM THE REGION, PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA\'S THABO </p><p>MBEKI.  SUCH SUPPORT WILL DO NOTHING TO ATTENUATE THE </p><p>PRICKLY MUGABE\'S ARROGANCE AND USUAL TACTIC OF RAISING </p><p>THE STAKES AND SUSPENDING THE RULES TO GET WHAT HE </p><p>WANTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE GOOD NEWS, HOWEVER, IS THAT WE SENSE A </p><p>GENUINE DESIRE IN THE COUNTRY TO PUT THE RECENT, </p><p>DIABOLICAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN BEHIND ITSELF AND MOVE </p><p>FORWARD TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO ITS IMAGE, COHESIVENESS </p><p>AND ECONOMY.  YES, ZIMBABWE IS CHANGED FOREVER AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03521  02 OF 02  281311Z </p><p>BROAD-BASED DEMOCRACY, AS WE ADVOCATE IT IN OUR MISSION </p><p>PROGRAM PLAN, HAS MADE A BRILLIANT SHOWING OVER THE JUNE </p><p>24-25 WEEKEND.  WE BELIEVE OUR PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY </p><p>BUILDING PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN FULLY OPERATIONAL SINCE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1999 IS NOW MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER.  WE LOOK </p><p>FORWARD TO HELPING ZIMBABWE SUSTAIN IT AND WELCOME IT </p><p>INTO THE FOLD OF THE COMMUNITY OF DEMOCRACIES. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
