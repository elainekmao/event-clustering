<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 000598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION - ENTER </p><p>RAWLINGS STAGE RIGHT? - CORRECTED FOR DATE IN PARA 1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) </p><p>continues the balancing act of assembling a historical record </p><p>of human rights abuses while avoiding politically charged </p><p>proceedings.  It faced its most difficult public proceedings </p><p>yet when the independent journalist Kwaku Baako deviated from </p><p>his expected testimony to offer hearsay evidence.  He said </p><p>that former President Jerry John Rawlings, in unrelated </p><p>incidents, ordered and supervised torture sessions and the </p><p>extra-judicial killing of a former colleague.  The testimony </p><p>invoked cheers and jeers from spectators ) the first hint of </p><p>the political circus that the NRC is struggling to avoid. </p><p>The NRC has invited former President Rawlings to submit a </p><p>written  response to the various allegations.  The opposition </p><p>NDC party, complaining about the admission of hearsay </p><p>evidence, fears (or claims to fear) the witch hunt has begun. </p><p>The NRC would welcome public testimony from Rawlings, and </p><p>Rawlings himself told Poloff in a March 20 meeting that he </p><p>will appear if asked.  Such testimony could be a useful </p><p>exploration of a very violent period in Ghana\'s history; it </p><p>could also polarize political factions.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Journalist Testimony </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On March 11, Kwaku Baako testified as a witness in </p><p>the torture case of the late Mawuli Goka (son of a Nkrumah </p><p>government Finance Minister) who was tried for treason and </p><p>executed.  While not an eyewitness to the torture, Baako was </p><p>imprisoned with Goka and saw the scars on his body.  He </p><p>offered very compelling and disturbing testimony on the </p><p>abuses heaped on those imprisoned. During the testimony, </p><p>Baako also alleged that former President Rawlings ordered and </p><p>supervised torture sessions, and also executions, in cases </p><p>not before the Commission that day.  None of these comments </p><p>were based upon personal knowledge.  His testimony, before a </p><p>packed house, evoked strong reaction from the crowd, and some </p><p>hostility to probing questions put to him by opposing </p><p>attorneys.  Much discussion ensued in local newspapers and </p><p>radio stations on the testimony, and Rawlings\' NDC party </p><p>issued a formal statement criticizing the Commission for </p><p>allowing such uncorroborated hearsay testimony to transpire. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Poloffs met with NRC Executive Secretary Ken Attafuah </p><p>March 21 to discuss the Baaku testimony and further </p><p>proceedings.  Attafuah initially noted that the NRC was a </p><p>quasi-judicial body designed for victim reconciliation as </p><p>much as formal fact finding.  As such, the rules of evidence </p><p>used in a court of law were not binding, but used only as "a </p><p>guide".  The healing function of the NRC, he said, made it </p><p>necessary to afford victims the full opportunity to express </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although disconcerted by Baaku\'s sudden straying into </p><p>matters not before the Commission, Attafuah said that </p><p>Commission members were generally hesitant to interrupt </p><p>witnesses who offered hearsay testimony in the midst of </p><p>emotional recitations of events.  This might be construed as </p><p>"inappropriately stifling" testimony.  Such evidence would be </p><p>admissible, he said, but would only be used in the findings </p><p>of the NRC if the weight of further testimony and </p><p>investigation warranted it.  Generally speaking, NRC </p><p>procedures sought to avoid the surprises seen in Baako\'s </p><p>testimony, he further explained.  Those testifying are asked </p><p>to put their testimony in writing, allowing the accused </p><p>advanced warning and preparation.  Baako did not submit his </p><p>free-ranging and unconnected accusations about Rawlings to </p><p>the NRC in advance.  Attafuah asserted that the Commission </p><p>was anxious to avoid the circus-like atmosphere that often </p><p>prevailed at the human rights commission hearings in Nigeria, </p><p>and he and Commission members were not about to let such </p><p>"straying" occur regularly. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Possible Rawlings\' Testimony </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turning to the subject of former President Rawlings\' </p><p>possible testimony, Dr. Attafuah stated that the NRC has sent </p><p>a letter to Rawlings requesting a written response to the </p><p>Baaku accusations.  The Commission had also sent several </p><p>other letters on unrelated cases, also inviting a response. </p><p>The Commission had yet to invite Rawlings to appear </p><p>personally before the Commission, and would not consider </p><p>doing so before it had heard from a number of other </p><p>witnesses. Any decision requesting his appearance would not </p><p>be based solely upon the as-yet unsubstantiated hearsay </p><p>testimony of Baaku. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Attafuah suggested that Rawlings would likely be </p><p>eager to appear, and would make a compelling witness.  There </p><p>were a number of people in contact with the Commission, he </p><p>commented, who would attest to their lives being saved by </p><p>Rawlings during the very turbulent times when Rawlings first </p><p>came to power.  Rawlings was the central figure in the 1979 </p><p>and 1981 coups, he commented, and led the PNDC government for </p><p>12 years, a period when many abuses occurred.  No testimony </p><p>from Rawlings, he said, would significantly diminish the </p><p>impact and the work of the Commission. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Rawlings\' Meeting </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Polchief met with Rawlings and an aide March 19, and </p><p>confirmed that Rawlings had received letters from the </p><p>Commission inviting written responses.  Regarding the Kwaku </p><p>Baaku testimony, the former President said his legal team </p><p>(led by former Speaker and Supreme Court Justice D. F. Annan) </p><p>would essentially reply that "I don\'t comment on hearsay </p><p>testimony."  Although much perturbed by the Kwaku Baaku </p><p>submissions, Rawlings said that if invited to appear before </p><p>the Commission, he would do so "willingly." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Rawlings, agitated and emotional, said repeatedly that </p><p>he had only witnessed a single execution during his time as </p><p>an officer in the Air Force, and, later, as Head of State: </p><p>that of a fellow member of the armed forces involved in the </p><p>murder of Ghanaian judges in 1982 who had been properly tried </p><p>and found guilty.  He denied overseeing torture sessions.  He </p><p>saw the Kwaku Baaku testimony, he said, as "one more example </p><p>of the NPP trying to ruin the NDC and myself."  He also </p><p>asserted that, should he appear, he would have ample examples </p><p>of how he in fact restrained "the boys" during a time when </p><p>many abuses did indeed occur, and many more killings "could </p><p>easily have happened." </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment.  Kwaku Baaku, local journalist and political </p><p>gadfly, runs a local paper in which he attacks Rawlings in </p><p>nearly every issue. The Commission could easily have </p><p>anticipated Baaku "straying" from his anticipated testimony. </p><p>Perhaps it simply chose to let him proceed, and raise </p><p>explosive issues that it must, in time, examine in more </p><p>comprehensive fashion. In any case, the issue is now joined, </p><p>and both the Commission and Rawlings\' handlers assert they </p><p>are ready and willing to have him testify in open session. </p><p>Rawlings, still a very skilled and charismatic speaker, will </p><p>be no pushover. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Comment continued.  Testimony by Rawlings on his </p><p>role in the 1979 and 1981 coups, and on abuses during his </p><p>time as head of state, will make great political theater.  If </p><p>he is indeed allowed to tell his story as he sees it, and </p><p>bring witnesses to support him, the Commission may, through </p><p>that testimony, and the testimony of the many victims who </p><p>suffered grievously, shed an accurate light on some very dark </p><p>moments in Ghanaian history.  However, avoiding descent into </p><p>catcalls and general chaos will require a firmer </p><p>administrative hand on proceedings than that exhibited during </p><p>the Baaku testimony. End comment. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
