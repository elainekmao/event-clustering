Summary: Kuwaiti commentators show predictable sympathy </p><p>to the US position with the UNSC and the Turkish </p><p>Parliament\'s refusal to accept US troops for an attack on </p><p>Iraq. Blix\'s "indecisive" reports are blamed for </p><p>contributing to the disunity on the Security Council. </p><p>Opposition to war in Iraq continues in Islamist circles with </p><p>the radical Islamist "Salafist" group calling for opposition </p><p>to this "new Crusade." </p><p> </p><p>A writer attacks the Department\'s Shared Values campaign, </p><p>declaring that the State Department has abandoned it due to </p><p>excessive criticism and the realization that US policies are </p><p>to blame for its poor image in the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>On the news pages, three more Kuwaitis were arrested on </p><p>suspicion of providing intelligence to Iraq. The trial of </p><p>Sami al-Mutairi, charged with the January 21 murder of </p><p>American civilian defense contractor Michael Pouliot and the </p><p>injuring of his colleague, began on March 12. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: The Kuwaiti Salafi Movement (conservative </p><p>Islamist) issued a press release denouncing American plans </p><p>for war against Iraq, and calling on the Arab and Islamic </p><p>worlds to confront this "new Crusade." </p><p> </p><p>The Kuwaiti Criminal Court began hearing of the case of Sami </p><p>Al-Mutairi, charged with killing American citizen Michael </p><p>Pouliot and injuring his colleague in a shooting attack on </p><p>January 21, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Three Kuwaitis were arrested on suspicion of providing </p><p>intelligence to the Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p>Three Americans were detained for photographing military </p><p>installations and sensitive areas of Kuwait International </p><p>Airport. </p><p> </p><p>Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, refuted Iraqi claims that the holes which </p><p>were made in the border fence earlier this week were an </p><p>aggression to which Kuwait will be legally held responsible: </p><p>"Passages in the border fence were made on our land, and </p><p>this is our right." </p><p> </p><p>Daily Al-Qabas reports that Washington is expected to order </p><p>the departure of its non-essential diplomats and their </p><p>families from Kuwait, Israel and Syria this week. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait Airways has reduced the number of flights to some </p><p>destinations during the month of March. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait Petroleum Company states it will close two refineries </p><p>if war breaks out. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Health has begun vaccinating emergency </p><p>medical workers against smallpox. </p><p> </p><p>The Humanitarian Operations Center, a liaison center for </p><p>relief NGOs and the US military, was opened in Kuwait City </p><p>on March 11. </p><p> </p><p>Peninsula Shield troops may be assigned to undertake </p><p>humanitarian operations and to protect Iraqi refugees as </p><p>necessary. </p><p> </p><p>Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah hailed Jordan\'s support of </p><p>Kuwaiti issues in the recent Arab and Islamic summits, and </p><p>King Abdullah\'s refusal to meet Ali Hassan Al-Majid, the </p><p>military governor of Kuwait during the 1990-91 occupation, </p><p>on a recent Arab trip. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3. "The Turkish Dilemma " </p><p>Dr. Yacoub Al-Sharah wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(3/11): "Turkey has disappointed the US by not allowing it </p><p>to deploy its forces in preparation for the expected war on </p><p>Iraq despite Turkey\'s military and political agreements with </p><p>the US. [T]his crisis is expected to get worse unless there </p><p>is a sudden reversal of the Turkish parliament decision, or </p><p>if Turkey does not offer alternate solution that coincides </p><p>with the American demands." </p><p> </p><p>4. "The Blazing Reports" </p><p>Lawyer Jamal Al-Kandari wrote in independent Al-Watan </p><p>(3/11): "The gray Blix\'s reports regarding WMD in Iraq have </p><p>contributed to creating a big gap among the 15 [Security </p><p>Council members] at the UN. His reports were not decisive, </p><p>despite the fact that he was convinced that Iraq had </p><p>violated the resolutions. He imagined that being courteous </p><p>with Iraq would contribute in Iraq\'s response to disclose </p><p>its WMD. Blix\'s elastic statements in his reports have sowed </p><p>sedition among the UN members." </p><p> </p><p>5. "Even in America There are Foolish Propagandists" </p><p>Islamist Adel Al-Qassar wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(3/11):  "There are ignorant propagandists in the Isalmic </p><p>world who deform the true image of Islam, just as there are </p><p>foolish propagandists such as Senator Joseph Biden. [that </p><p>are] radical extremists who distort the US image because </p><p>they simply do not understand Islam. Both types of </p><p>propagandists, Islamists and Americans alike, are considered </p><p>a threat to the security and stability of their societies. </p><p>The contradictory concepts of US efforts to improve its </p><p>image, and its [Middle East policies] have led the US State </p><p>Department to call off the Shared Values campaign in the </p><p>face of criticism by Muslim Arabs in the US and abroad." </p><p> </p><p>6. "Your Father\'s Worries" </p><p>Mohammad Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/11):  "To </p><p>President George Bush, I share your father\'s worries at </p><p>seeing his son walking alone on an unpaved road in preparing </p><p>to make a decision against Iraq. [G]iven the circumstances, </p><p>it would be wise to give international inspectors more time </p><p>to scrap Iraqi WMD, as put forth in a plan supported by </p><p>France, Germany, Russia and China. Mr. President, we once </p><p>again share your father\'s worry about you and about the </p><p>world. The question is, does ousting Saddam Hussein and his </p><p>regime justify the enormous expected losses to be incurred </p><p>by the US?" </p><p> </p><p>7. "USA: The Shelter for People from Tyrants and </p><p>Suppressors" </p><p>Nahar Al-Mikrad wrote in Independent Al-Watan (3/12):  "We </p><p>cannot hide our admiration for the people and the great </p><p>nation of the USA. America does not hide facts and its </p><p>record is crystal clean. America confronted the Nazis and </p><p>their allies and ended their dreams of expansion. We, as </p><p>Kuwaitis and GCC citizens, appreciate the American stance </p><p>and we can never forget their sacrifices for liberating us </p><p>from Iraq. Today, the US and Britain are standing ready for </p><p>the zero hour in order to remove the tyrant in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
