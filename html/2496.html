ON FEBUARY 15 AGRICULTURE MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO PROPOSED ATAX ON BEEF TO FUND NEW </p><p>MEASURES TO ENSURE MEAT AFETY. ACCORDING TO </p><p>ALEMANNO THIS TAX WOULD INCRASE GOVERNMENT </p><p>REVENUE BY 67 MILLION EUROS AND B USED TO </p><p>AUGMENT FUNDS PRESENTLY EARMARKED FOR TH BSE </p><p>CRISIS.  THIS TARGET WAS CALCULATED UNDER TE </p><p>ASSUMPTIONS OF CURRENT LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION </p><p>AND A TAX FIXED AT 5 CENTS PER KG.  THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S SCHEME WAS PROPOSED AS CONSUMERS </p><p>REACTED WITH ALARM TO THE DISCOVERY ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 OF ITALY\'S FIRST CASE OF THE </p><p>HUMAN VERSION OF MAD COW DISEASE (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>2.  ITALIAN FARMER ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA, CONFEDERAZIONE ITALIANA </p><p>AGRICOLTORI, AND THE ITALIAN MEAT INDUSTRY </p><p>ASSOCIATION ASSOCARNI SUPPORTED THE SCHEME </p><p>BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED THIS TAX A </p><p>CONTRIBUTION BY RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS TO </p><p>FOOD SAFETY COSTS. ACCORDING TO </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA A SIMILAR TAX ALREADY </p><p>OPERATES IN FRANCE.  A NEGATIVE REACTION CAME </p><p>FROM ITALY\'S OTHER MAJOR FARMER ORGANIZATION, </p><p>COLDIRETTI, AND ALL CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS WHO </p><p>OPPOSED PAYING EXTRA FOR A SERVICE THEY </p><p>BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALREADY PROVIDE. ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 10 MINISTER OF HEALTH SIRCHIA WAS </p><p>REPORTED TO ENDORSE THE PLAN, BUT BY THE </p><p>FOLLOWING WEEK HE PANNED THE TAX. </p><p> </p><p>3.

THIS MEETING CANCELED THE TAX </p><p>FOR 2002, PROMISED THAT GOVERNMENT WOULD PICK </p><p>UP COSTS FOR COLLECTING AND DISPOSING OF </p><p>"SPECIFIED RISK MATERIALS" OR BYPRODUCTS OF </p><p>SLAUGHTER FACILITIES WHICH MIGHT TRANSMIT </p><p>BSE, AND MADE SEVERAL PROMISES, INCLUDING </p><p>REVISITING THE IDEA OF A TAX IN 2003.  A FEW </p><p>CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS NEVERTHELESS VOWED TO </p><p>BOYCOTT BEEF TO PRESSURE INDUSTRY TO GIVE </p><p>THEM MORE ASSURANCES ON MEAT SAFETY, BUT </p><p>WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COST TO CONSUMERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALEMANNO\'S PLAN CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING </p><p>ITEMS (UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION): </p><p>1- THE GOVERNMENT WILL FUND THE COLLECTION </p><p>AND DESTRUCTION OF MEAT AND BONE MEAL (MBM) </p><p>AND SPECIFIED RISK MATERIALS ( SRMS) THROUGH </p><p>THE END OF 2002. </p><p>2- THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE NEW </p><p>PROGRAMS FOR THE USE OF SRMS AS ORGANIC </p><p>MATERIAL FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION. </p><p>3- THERE WILL BE INCREASED CONTROLS ON </p><p>ILLEGAL SLAUGHTERING AND ILLEGAL MEAT AND </p><p>BONE MEAL (MBM) USE  IN ORDER TO BUILD </p><p>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.  ESTABLISH TRAINING </p><p>COURSES FOR OFFICERS WORKING IN </p><p>SLAUGHTERHOUSES.  SET A MARKET REVIEWING </p><p>AGENCY TO PREVENT SPECULATION ON PRICES. </p><p>4- ESTABLISH A BOVINE DATA BASE BY JUNE 2002. </p><p>5- STUDY A WAY TO SHARE THE COSTS OF THIS </p><p>PLAN THROUGHOUT THE MEAT PRODUCTION, SUPPLY </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  INTERNATIONAL PRESS REPORTS ON FEBRUARY </p><p>13 REVEAL THAT JAPAN\'S INVESTIGATION INTO ITS </p><p>OWN OUTBREAK OF BSE HAVE LEAD THE GOJ TO </p><p>SOURCES OF CATTLE FEED INCLUDING ITALIAN </p><p>SALES OF MEAT AND BONE MEAL MADE IN 1998. THE </p><p>GOJ HAS ASKED THE GOI FOR AN EXPLANATION OF </p><p>WHY IN 1998 ITALIAN MBM WAS NOT STEAM. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
