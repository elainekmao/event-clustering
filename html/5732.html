Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Jaffna is in an uproar in the wake of a </p><p>February 12 confrontation between the Tamil Tigers and </p><p>the military.  Angry over the incident in which several </p><p>cadre were injured, the Tigers forced the postponement </p><p>of the planned reopening of the Jaffna Library, a </p><p>cultural landmark.  Tiger spokesman Balasingham was also </p><p>quoted as bitterly complaining about the incident, </p><p>asserting it was a threat to the ceasefire.  With the </p><p>help of the monitors, the GSL is trying to tamp down the </p><p>tensions.  In essence, this is another instance of the </p><p>LTTE\'s employing mafia-type tactics to prove a point. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) LTTE/MILITARY INCIDENT:  Jaffna District is in </p><p>an uproar in the wake of a February 12 confrontation </p><p>between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and </p><p>the Sri Lankan military.  The incident took place on </p><p>February 12 and was sparked when Sri Lanka Army (SLA) </p><p>troops stopped LTTE women cadre in the town of Manipay, </p><p>located just outside of Jaffna town.  The cadre were </p><p>reportedly trying to pass through a military checkpoint </p><p>wearing their uniforms and reacted badly when the SLA </p><p>ordered them to remove their belts, which were of a </p><p>military style.  (Note:  The cadre seem to have been </p><p>unarmed, but, according to the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>accord, they cannot be in uniform in government- </p><p>controlled areas, such as Jaffna.)  The dispute quickly </p><p>flared into fisticuffs with pro-LTTE Tamil civilians </p><p>protesting the actions of the military and the SLA </p><p>calling out a riot squad.  Several LTTE cadre and army </p><p>personnel were injured in the confrontation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) SLMM/GSL REACTION:  The Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was quickly called in to </p><p>investigate the incident.  In a public statement issued </p><p>soon thereafter, SLMM spokesman Teitor Torkelson said </p><p>the LTTE cadre had violated the ceasefire accord by </p><p>wearing uniforms in government-controlled Jaffna.  He </p><p>also stated that the army used excessive force when </p><p>quelling the public demonstration.  The SLMM pledged to </p><p>continue its investigation, and urged both sides to calm </p><p>down. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Eager to protect the peace process, the Sri </p><p>Lankan government also urged that all sides cool off. </p><p>During a town hall-type meeting in Colombo hosted by a </p><p>local think-tank, G.L. Peiris and Milinda Moragoda, two </p><p>key GSL ministers involved in peace process issues, </p><p>briefly discussed the LTTE-military confrontation on </p><p>February 13.  They asserted that the GSL was doing </p><p>everything possible to resolve the dispute.  Moreover, </p><p>they said the Tigers had agreed with the GSL on the need </p><p>to lower temperatures. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) POSTPONEMENT OF LIBRARY REOPENING:  The Sri </p><p>Lankan ministers evidently spoke too soon, as the LTTE </p><p>decided to up the ante.  Pro-LTTE elements honored the </p><p>group\'s call for a work stoppage in large parts of </p><p>Jaffna on February 13.  In the meantime, LTTE supporters </p><p>reportedly attacked the offices of an anti-LTTE Tamil </p><p>party in Chavakachcheri, a town located to the east of </p><p>Jaffna town.  In reaction to the LTTE-instigated ruckus, </p><p>Jaffna\'s mayor announced late February 13 that the </p><p>planned reopening of the Jaffna Library scheduled for </p><p>February 14 had been postponed indefinitely.  (Note: </p><p>The library is a cultural landmark for many Tamils.  It </p><p>was burned down in fighting in the 1980s and all its </p><p>books -- some of them priceless -- were utterly </p><p>destroyed.  In an attempt at reconciliation with Tamils, </p><p>the government has been working for some time to rebuild </p><p>the structure, which is believed to be almost finished.) </p><p>By all accounts, the announcement by the mayor was </p><p>engineered by the LTTE, which made clear that it was </p><p>angry about the February 12 incident and did not want </p><p>any sort of celebration of GSL-Tamil amity at this time. </p><p>In making this point, the pro-LTTE elements reportedly </p><p>paid a personal visit to the mayor, threatening him and </p><p>his staff. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  The Tiger pressure was a bit much for </p><p>Jaffna\'s municipal council members and, shortly after </p><p>the announcement of the postponing of the library </p><p>reopening, they resigned en masse.  Even Tamil United </p><p>Liberation Front, "TULF," members of the council -- </p><p>usually a pro-LTTE block -- were apparently put off by </p><p>the LTTE\'s strong-arm tactics.  In a rarity, for </p><p>example, V. Anandasangarai, a senior TULF MP and a </p><p>leader of the party, expressed public disappointment </p><p>with the LTTE.  While dramatic, the resignations were </p><p>more symbolic than anything else inasmuch as members\' </p><p>five-year terms of office were up next week in any case. </p><p>End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) LTTE HITS OUT SOME MORE:  Not content with just </p><p>shutting down the library\'s reopening, the LTTE decided </p><p>to up the pressure some more.  LTTE spokesman and the </p><p>head of its negotiating team, Anton Balasingham, for </p><p>example, was quoted as bitterly complaining about the </p><p>incident, and stating that if the military did not </p><p>change its ways the Tigers would reconsider their </p><p>involvement in the ceasefire.  Pro-LTTE students and </p><p>others have also planned a protest march for February 14 </p><p>at the end of which a petition is to handed over to the </p><p>SLMM complaining about the military\'s actions on </p><p>February 12. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT:  The government and the SLMM continue to </p><p>work feverishly to tamp down tensions.  The GSL, for </p><p>example, has announced that it is launching a full </p><p>inquiry into the military\'s role in the incident.  It is </p><p>not yet clear whether the LTTE will respond in a </p><p>cooperative manner soon.  Certainly, Balasingham\'s </p><p>reported statement that the ceasefire could be in the </p><p>balance was a bit menacing, as it was one of the first </p><p>times the LTTE has issued such a threat since the peace </p><p>process began.  Another factor that seems to underlie </p><p>the Tigers\' aggressive reaction includes the fact that </p><p>the group is clearly still sore over the February 7 </p><p>incident in which three Tiger cadre committed suicide </p><p>after their arms smuggling boat was intercepted (see Ref </p><p>B).  (Note:  It is also the case, of course, that the </p><p>LTTE\'s latest protest campaign fits in well with its </p><p>long-standing opposition to the military\'s security </p><p>zones in Jaffna.)  In addition, as reviewed in Ref B, </p><p>the overall pattern of the Tigers\' latest antics </p><p>highlight their continued employment of mafia-type </p><p>tactics against perceived opponents.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
