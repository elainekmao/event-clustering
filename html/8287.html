<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000623 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: THIRTEEN YEARS ON, NLD CALLS ON JUNTA TO HONOR </p><p>1990 ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  At a ceremony honoring the 13th anniversary </p><p>of multiparty elections in Burma, the National League for </p><p>Democracy, which won 392 out of the 485 elected seats, called </p><p>on the regime to honor the election\'s results.  Citing the </p><p>junta\'s pledges from the pre- and post-election period that </p><p>it would allow elected representatives to take office, the </p><p>NLD lambasted the State Peace and Development Council for </p><p>failing to honor these commitments.  NLD leader Aung San Suu </p><p>Kyi did not attend the ceremony, as she continued a </p><p>month-long visit to northern Burma.  Despite continuing junta </p><p>harassment of her party and supporters along the route, large </p><p>crowds have greeted her at every stop.  Finally, there were </p><p>new arrests of political activists on May 19, while others </p><p>arrested in February were released.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On May 27, at a crowded and sweltering ceremony at </p><p>NLD headquarters, party representatives called on the SPDC to </p><p>honor the results of multiparty elections held in 1990.  With </p><p>electricity to the building cut off (purposely?), the </p><p>temperature inside soared as well wishers, press, and </p><p>representatives of other political parties crowded in to hear </p><p>the proceedings.  Diplomats from the U.S., UK, Germany, </p><p>France, Japan, and a smattering of UN agencies attended the </p><p>event.  Conspicuously absent were any diplomats from ASEAN </p><p>countries.  Speakers from the NLD and other parties held the </p><p>SPDC to account for its failure to follow through on public </p><p>statements over the years that it would return to the </p><p>barracks and allow the elected officials to govern the </p><p>country.  There were tributes to elected Members of </p><p>Parliament who continue to press for recognition of the </p><p>elections and, as a result, have sacrificed their freedom and </p><p>the well being of their families.  Although 40-50 MPs-elect </p><p>attended the event, a rumored larger turnout of MPs from </p><p>around the country did not materialize. </p><p> </p><p>ASSK Still On the Road </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi, reportedly in Mandalay </p><p>on her return from a trip to Kachin State, did not attend the </p><p>ceremony.  Her traveling party and citizens hoping to see her </p><p>have been harassed and intimidated at almost every location </p><p>on the trip.  Large crowds of supporters have nonetheless </p><p>turned out, ignoring authorities\' threats of retaliation. </p><p>ASSK is expected to return to Rangoon on or about June 2, in </p><p>anticipation of UN Special Envoy Razali\'s visit from June </p><p>6-10. </p><p> </p><p>New Political Arrests and Releases </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Three NLD members, including one MP-elect, were </p><p>reportedly arrested in Sagaing Division May 19 for discussing </p><p>rice problems with local farmers.  The three were reportedly </p><p>sentenced to 2 years in prison under a law dealing with </p><p>public disturbances.  The MP-elect, U Win Myint Aung, was the </p><p>first MP-elect since 1998 to receive a prison sentence </p><p>(although many have been detained or put under house arrest). </p><p> The other two members were officers in the NLD Tabayin </p><p>township office.  We have heard reports that six other NLD </p><p>members may have been arrested in the same township, but no </p><p>additional information is yet available. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Late-May Foreign radio broadcasts report three </p><p>members of the Arakan League for democracy were released </p><p>April 6 - 12.  On May 20 the SPDC released Sai Nyunt Lwin, </p><p>the Secretary General of the Shan Nationalities League for </p><p>Democracy (SNLD) from Insein prison in Rangoon.  Sai Nyunt </p><p>Lwin was arrested along with several NLD members on February </p><p>8 for allegedly distributing democracy literature and for </p><p>acts against the State.  Sai Nyunt Lwin turned state\'s </p><p>witness and was not charged, while those he testified against </p><p>received sentences ranging from five years to life.  Sai </p><p>Nyunt Lwin reportedly claimed his testimony did not lead to </p><p>the convictions as the others did not deny the charges </p><p>against them.  He is being reinstated as the SNLD\'s Secretary </p><p>General.  This episode has soured relations between the NLD </p><p>and the SNLD, Burma\'s second largest party.  SNLD Chairman </p><p>Hkun Htun Oo was noticeably absent from the May 27 elections </p><p>ceremony at NLD headquarters. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
