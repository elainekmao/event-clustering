EARLY RATIFICATION WOULD </p><p>BE A GOOD SIGN OF US WILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, HE ADDED.  HE PLEDGED THAT VIETNAM WAS </p><p>PREPARED TO RATIFY THE BTA AFTER THE US CONGRESS HAD DONE </p><p>SO.  HE SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD SUBMITTED THE BTA </p><p>TO THE STATE PRESIDENT, WHILE RELEVANT ECONOMIC AGENCIES </p><p>WERE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING TO IMPLEMENT ITS </p><p>TERMS.
