CPN-UML and four other </p><p> political parties, which proposed Madhav Kumar Nepal\'s </p><p> candidature for the prime ministership, have expressed </p><p>their dissatisfaction over Thapa\'s appointment. </p><p>Seventy-five-year-old Thapa has been appointed to the </p><p>top post for the fifth time in his political career </p><p>that dates back to 1958.

(Media reports, 6/9) </p><p> </p><p>-- Koirala puts condition for support: Nepali Congress </p><p>president Girija Prasad Koirala offered to support the </p><p>Surya Bahadur Thapa Government provided it would </p><p>recommend revival of the dissolved House of parliament. </p><p>(centrist "Kantipur," V/D, 6/7) </p><p> </p><p>PM PLEDGES FOR PEACE AND ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>-- Prime Minister Thapa pledged (6/7) that his </p><p>government would evolve a national consensus in order </p><p>to solve the Maoist problem.  He appealed to all the </p><p>political parties including the Maoists to come around </p><p>to a national consensus and facilitate the people to </p><p>exercise their right to elect a new government at the </p><p>center as well as the local level. Major political </p><p>parties have taken Thapa\'s address to the nation as not </p><p>different from the traditional ones in its essence and </p><p>meaning.

Prachanda adds that the </p><p>Maoists\' stance towards the new government would be the </p><p>same as towards the Chand government on the dialogue </p><p>table, reiterating that constitutionally the Thapa </p><p>government was not very different from the Chand </p><p>government. (Media reports, 6/5)  Dr. Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>said, "There is no elemental difference between his </p><p>predecessor and him.  He would do better to continue </p><p>the four-month-old peace process." ("The Kathmandu </p><p>Post," 6/5) </p><p> </p><p>-- Regressive move, says UM </p><p>L: The meeting of the </p><p>standing committee of the UML on Thursday labeled </p><p>Thapa\'s appointment as a "continuation of regression." </p><p>("Kantipur," 6/5) </p><p>-- Five parties flay appointment: The five major </p><p>political parties have flayed the appointment of Thapa </p><p>as the new Prime Minister.  They have claimed that the </p><p>new move taken by the King was only eyewash and would </p><p>merely strengthen regressive tendency.

(Media </p><p>reports, 6/5-6) </p><p> </p><p>-- Former Nepali Congress Minister skeptical: "Thapa\'s </p><p>chance of his making an all-inclusive government is </p><p>nowhere in sight.  A most probable scenario is that his </p><p>cabinet would consist of old Panchayat politicians </p><p>rejected in the electoral process.  Mr. Thapa will have </p><p>to show all his skill and dynamism to prove that this </p><p>will not be so, and what he means is nothing short of </p><p>the immediate and full reactivation of the </p><p>constitution, which is the fundamental law of the </p><p>land."

(Nepalnews.com, 6/5) </p><p> </p><p>-- Foreign hands: Security analysts claim that Chand\'s </p><p>resignation was a result of the growing influence of </p><p>the U.S. intelligence agency in Nepal\'s internal </p><p>affairs.  India became suspicious over the U.S.\'s </p><p>increasing interest in Nepal and mobilized all its </p><p>energy to resolve Nepal\'s problems.  When parliamentary </p><p>parties proposed U.S.-trusted Madhav Nepal, even Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba, the honest actor of the U.S. </p><p>intelligence agency, supported the proposal.  It was </p><p>almost sure then that Nepal would become the new Prime </p><p>Minister.  But Indian heavy weights - former PM Chandra </p><p>Shekhar, former Ambassador K.V. Rajan and Nepal expert </p><p>S.D. Muni, came to Kathmandu and played crucial roles </p><p>to get Thapa to the post of prime minister.

It was </p><p>during his visit Thapa emerged as a candidate for </p><p>premiership, despite the recommendation of the five </p><p>political parties.  The nomination, however, did </p><p>highlight one thing clearly: India intends to turn </p><p>Nepal into another Sikkim.  Thapa is a puppet.

It is an indication of how weak </p><p>we have become as a state that diplomats this time </p><p>didn\'t even bother to conceal their meetings with </p><p>political leaders and express their preference for </p><p>leadership..."
