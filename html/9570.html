<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001847 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OSD FOR DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: GG, KCRM, MD, NL, PREL, UP, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: OSCE:  A/S JONES\' MEETINGS IN THE HAGUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: DALY-EUR EMAILS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES DANNY R. RUSSEL FOR REAS </p><p>ONS 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>(A/S Jones cleared this cable.) </p><p> </p><p>(U)  1.  During a July 15 visit to The Hague, A/S Jones met </p><p>with Daan Everts, director of the Dutch OSCE office, to </p><p>discuss Moldova, Georgia, and the December 2003 ministerial. </p><p>OSCE was also raised in her meeting with parliamentarians </p><p>from the Labor party (PvdA). Other issues reported septels. </p><p> </p><p>MOLDOVA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 2.  A/S Jones and Everts agreed that the OSCE (and the </p><p>Dutch as CiO) must "leave no stone unturned" to achieve a </p><p>peace settlement in Moldova by year\'s end, and doing so will </p><p>require U.S. and European pressure on all parties.  A/S Jones </p><p>said the U.S. line with Russia is, "you can\'t possibly want </p><p>to perpetuate instability on your southern border; now is the </p><p>time to end the frozen conflicts."  She asked Everts whether </p><p>there were particular points Deputy Secretary Armitage could </p><p>raise during counter-terrorism talks with Russian deputy FM </p><p>Trubrikov July 22-23 in Williamsburg. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 3. Everts described Russia as unpleasantly surprised by </p><p>the peace consolidation concept, and underscored the </p><p>importance of getting the Russians on board, especially </p><p>before an August summit among Putin, Moldova\'s Voronin and </p><p>the Ukraine\'s Kuchma, and Putin\'s visit to Chisinau in </p><p>October. He said that the Russians appear to be hopeful that </p><p>a settlement will not/not happen, allowing them to maintain </p><p>the status quo at year\'s end and obtain OSCE blessing to keep </p><p>the Russian-led peacekeeping arrangement in place. The CiO </p><p>wants to avoid this at all costs; A/S Jones reiterated U.S. </p><p>agreement with the Dutch on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 4. Everts said the U.S. could help convince Russia that </p><p>there is no chance the OSCE would bless the current </p><p>peacekeeping arrangement, and encourage Russia to make good </p><p>on its claim that it wants to comply with its Istanbul </p><p>commitments before the Maastricht ministerial in December. </p><p>Likewise, the Russians should understand that settling </p><p>Moldova is an opportunity to work more closely with the EU. </p><p>Everts added that it would be helpful for the U.S. to make </p><p>clear to Smirnov that a federal system is necessary and that </p><p>there is no chance of support for the sort of arrangements </p><p>existing between Serbia and Montenegro.  A/S Jones and Everts </p><p>also discussed collaborating on a demarche to the Ukrainians. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 5. In envisioning the way forward, Everts said agreeing </p><p>on the basic structure of the federation is the prerequisite </p><p>for a peace settlement, which in turn is the prerequisite for </p><p>the EU agreeing to provide peacekeepers.  The OSCE must work </p><p>to guarantee that, upon agreement of a peace settlement, any </p><p>future EU peacekeeping operation in Moldova would fall under </p><p>an OSCE umbrella and conform to Berlin-plus.  He said work is </p><p>underway in Brussels, including formats that engage the </p><p>Russians.  (Note: Deputy Political Director Herman Schaper </p><p>called POL Counselor July 16 (ref emails) to clarify that the </p><p>Dutch presented the EU and Russia with a "food for thought" </p><p>paper, which included the idea of EU peacekeepers along with </p><p>other options, but that no decision has been made yet in </p><p>favor of an EU force. End note.)  Everts and Jones discussed </p><p>the possibility of naming a senior statesman to bring talks </p><p>to a conclusion. </p><p> </p><p>GEORGIA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 6. Everts, noting that he was working in conjunction with </p><p>ODIHR, outlined CiO thinking on Georgian elections.  He said </p><p>the OSCE cannot assume operational charge for these </p><p>elections, and should not be seen as doing so.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the OSCE has an interest in helping to organize the Georgian </p><p>effort to ensure that what is done locally conforms as much </p><p>as possible with international standards.  This can be done </p><p>by:  ensuring early deployment of long-term advisors; </p><p>secunding an elections expert to the mission in Tbilisi to </p><p>alert the OSCE of problems and bring in short-term assistance </p><p>to solve them (the expert was due to arrive July 21); </p><p>maintaining a constant stream of high-level visits (CiO will </p><p>visit in October); assisting in the efforts of George Soros </p><p>to organize a local NGO election monitoring group, and </p><p>encourage NDI and others to assist in this area. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 7.  A/S Jones described James Baker\'s recent trip, </p><p>describing both his efforts and the ongoing political issues </p><p>in passing a Unified Election Code in Parliament.  Baker </p><p>worked hard to push the Georgians to take responsibility for </p><p>their own elections rather than rely on the international </p><p>community.  A/S Jones noted it is disheartening to see how </p><p>little faith the Georgian political parties have in </p><p>themselves.  The issue of identifying an individual to serve </p><p>as chairman of the central election commission remains a </p><p>stumbling block to passage of the Code, but the U.S. is </p><p>urging the OSCE to take on this responsibility.  A/S Jones </p><p>said intensive collaboration among the OSCE, COE, the local </p><p>ambassadors\' group in Tbilisi, and other interested parties </p><p>is necessary, and noted that Baker\'s visit had encouraged </p><p>Shevardnadze. Everts raised Abkhazia, saying the group of </p><p>Western friends needed prodding and that the CIO\'s role is </p><p>limited by the fact that the UN has the lead.  He said the </p><p>Dutch are focused on a police presence and on the return of </p><p>IDPs in Gali. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trafficking in Persons </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(U) 8.  A/S Jones said it was important that we find ways to </p><p>cooperate on anti-trafficking programs and initiatives in the </p><p>OSCE. Amb. Everts noted the OSCE was focused on encouraging </p><p>the adoption of anti-trafficking in persons measures </p><p>throughout the OSCE area.  At the December 2003 Maastricht </p><p>Ministerial, the Dutch would like to see the OSCE appoint a </p><p>high-ranking special representative to work on this issue. </p><p>At an earlier meeting with Dutch parliamentarians from the </p><p>Labor party, Nebahat Albayrak, rapporteur for the OSCE </p><p>parliamentary group\'s human dimension, also expressed </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 2003 Maastricht Ministerial </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>(C) 9. Deputy Political Director Herman Schaper urged that </p><p>the Secretary attend the December 2003 OSCE Ministerial in </p><p>Maastricht, Netherlands.  A/S Jones stressed that </p><p>streamlining the summit was key to persuading the Secretary </p><p>to attend. The U.S. had proposed that the Ministerial </p><p>Communique and regional statements be agreed prior to the </p><p>Ministerial to avoid forcing ministers to negotiate texts. </p><p>The U.S. also hoped that the reading of prepared texts by </p><p>ministers would be replaced by more directed discussion of a </p><p>small number of topics, especially the "frozen conflicts" in </p><p>the former Soviet Union.  A/S Jones noted that she would </p><p>raise these specific suggestions at the OSCE during her July </p><p>16-17 visit to Vienna. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
