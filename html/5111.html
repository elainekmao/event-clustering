<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/RPM, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, TU, IZ, NATO, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: NATO/IRAQ: TURKEY PATIENT FOR NOW BUT LOOKING FOR </p><p>NATO COVER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 9504 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: MFA DG for International Security Affairs </p><p>Morali told DCM January 13 that NATO should move forward </p><p>prudently on Articles IV and V with respect to Iraq. </p><p>Nevertheless, the GOT hopes the package outlined in reftel </p><p>with evolve as necessary and discussion of Article IV will </p><p>not be deferred indefinitely.  Morali noted that making </p><p>public the discussion of Iraq at NATO would ease the Turkish </p><p>public\'s anxiety over an Iraq operation and provide Turkey </p><p>international legitimacy to cooperate with the US.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) DCM delivered reftel points to MFA DG for </p><p>International Security Affairs Morali January 13, emphasizing </p><p>that discussion of Article IV and Iraq at NATO was premature </p><p>and that the US needed more time to prepare for the </p><p>discussion.  Morali appreciated that the USG responded </p><p>quickly to the Turkish initiative, which was "moving in the </p><p>direction of concrete action."  Morali noted the activity was </p><p>opening the way for NATO involvement in a potential </p><p>operation, which the GOT had been pursuing in order to gain </p><p>international legitimacy and allay public anxiety about an </p><p>operation.  He added that the point of the initiative was not </p><p>to turn US plans into a NATO operation, but to get legitimacy </p><p>for Turkey\'s participation.  The "political essence" of this </p><p>exercise was important for this reason and could facilitate a </p><p>political decision by the GOT.  Therefore, while prudence was </p><p>important, the GOT did not want the discussion deferred </p><p>indefinitely.  Morali said NATO solidarity should "come in a </p><p>timely way," preferably by January 27 when the Blix report </p><p>was due.  Furthermore, the GOT needed its public to know that </p><p>its defense was being discussed at NATO in order to counter </p><p>public disapproval of a military operation and Turkey\'s </p><p>involvement in it.  Morali assured the DCM that the </p><p>discussion of Article V was not urgent and would be taken up </p><p>if and when Iraq attacked Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Morali observed that the addition of CBW defense </p><p>capabilities to the package presented to the NAC by Wolfowitz </p><p>was welcome.  He hoped the package would evolve as additional </p><p>measures became necessary.  Morali agreed that tasking the </p><p>NMAs as proposed by reftel was the normal way to proceed and </p><p>should not encounter any problems among other Allies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Comment: For now, the GOT is satisfied with the US </p><p>response to its request for Article IV and V discussions at </p><p>NATO.  The process itself provides the new Turkish government </p><p>the cover it needs to convince the public its defense is </p><p>being carefully considered and that the operation has </p><p>international legitimacy.  Providing the GOT this cover soon, </p><p>will facilitate its deliberations on Iraq policy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
