HARARE 1076 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 1058 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Peggy Blackford for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  The MDC officially announced that protests </p><p>including demonstrations would begin June 2 and run </p><p>throughout the week.  However, in contrast to the official </p><p>MDC call for mass action next week, MDC Special Presidential </p><p>Advisor Gandi Mudzingwa confided that the party hoped to move </p><p>up its timetable, turn out large crowds for short </p><p>demonstrations in the high density areas over the weekend, </p><p>and avoid confrontations by catching the GOZ off guard.  He </p><p>indicated that the MDC is now confident that most police and </p><p>army are sympathetic to the MDC cause and will remain </p><p>neutral. If the demonstrations are a success, the MDC will </p><p>simply declare victory on Monday and will mostly limit next </p><p>week\'s action to a stayaway. The MDC hopes that these actions </p><p>will sway additional ZANU-PF loyalists to the view that a </p><p>negotiated change is essential. So far Mudzingwa is the only </p><p>one to suggest that action will begin before that Monday </p><p>deadline.  Embassy observers will remain alert to reports of </p><p>protest over the weekend but are dubious that significant </p><p>action will take place before the announced Monday start </p><p>date. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In an official statement issued May 29, MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai cited recent political and </p><p>economic woes, and the inability of the Mugabe government to </p><p>deal with these.  He appealed to all Zimbabweans throughout </p><p>the country to participate in on-going prayer meetings, and </p><p>during the week of June 2 to June 6, to "rise up in your </p><p>millions and take part in nationwide peaceful protest marches </p><p>for DEMOCRACY and GOOD GOVERNANCE", and to stayaway from work </p><p>for the week.  He emphasized MDC\'s commitment to non-violence </p><p>and urged protesters to be peaceful even if provoked. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)   PolOffs met Special Presidential Advisor Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa later on May 29 and queried him about specific MDC </p><p>plans.  Official announcements and conversations with other </p><p>MDC officials including MDC president Tsvangirai reported </p><p>reftels have implied that demonstrations would take place on </p><p>Monday or later next week and would concentrate on the city </p><p>center. In contrast, Mudzingwa said that the MDC was adopting </p><p>a different strategy which it hoped would demonstrate victory </p><p>early.  The party hopes to organize demonstrators in Harare </p><p>to protest over the weekend rather than waiting until next </p><p>week.  The demonstrations would take place in the high </p><p>density areas, particularly the western suburbs, on Saturday </p><p>and Sunday.  They would be called at the last minute and </p><p>would be kept to perhaps a half a hour so that GOZ would have </p><p>to scramble to react. If the police turned out in massive </p><p>numbers in one area, the party plans to  shift the </p><p>demonstration to another location.  This is a technique they </p><p>used this week at prayer meetings. When the police showed up </p><p>to prevent a crowd from gathering, MDC organizers were able </p><p>to quickly pass the word and move the meeting to a different </p><p>location.  If the demonstrations go well, the MDC will </p><p>declare victory and limit activities next week in Harare to </p><p>primarily a stayaway, though Mudzingwa did not rule out </p><p>further demonstrations.  Outside of Harare however, protests </p><p>are very likely to run into next week.  According to </p><p>Mudzingwa, the objective of this mass action is to erode the </p><p>confidence of ZANU-PF supporters and convince them that the </p><p>status quo cannot hold.  Asked how these hit and run tactics </p><p>would effect press coverage, Mudzingwa expressed confidence </p><p>that they had reliable contacts in the press who would be on </p><p>hand where needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)   On the issue of police reaction, Mudzingwa said </p><p>that they were confident that the majority were now either </p><p>sympathetic to the MDC position or determined to remain </p><p>neutral if at all possible.  He was somewhat concerned about </p><p>a few special units who have apparently received riot </p><p>training since March or that existing unit commanders would </p><p>be replaced by GOZ militants, possibly war veterans. </p><p>Mudzingwa said he thought the MDC\'s propaganda aimed at the </p><p>army, as well as private conversations with selected army </p><p>officers, had worked and that the greater part of the army </p><p>was inclined to remain neutral - though all uncertainties on </p><p>this front had not been eliminated.  On the whole however, he </p><p>believed that the MDC strategy would avoid confrontations by </p><p>assembling and disbursing too quickly for the GOZ forces to </p><p>be a problem. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)   Comment:  In theory Mudzingwa\'s plan sounds viable </p><p>but it relies heavily on very good organization and </p><p>communication, and the willingness of sympathetic police and </p><p>local authorities to remain apolitical even if they get </p><p>advance notice that a demonstration is imminent.  Its </p><p>avoidance of marching/demonstrations near State House or city </p><p>center would be less neuralgic to authorities.  The plan also </p><p>relies on holding demonstrations in distant locales and </p><p>spreading militant security forces too thin to respond </p><p>effectively.  Word travels fast though, and a harsh crackdown </p><p>in one suburb could quell peoples\' willingness to take to the </p><p>streets in others.  The MDC has a very limited track record </p><p>of getting people to march, and it is unclear whether general </p><p>frustration and desperation is enough to make notoriously </p><p>patient Zimbabweans take to the streets in huge numbers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In light of the fact that to date Mudzingwa, though </p><p>very well-placed in the MDC hierarchy, is the only source to </p><p>report any action is planned before Monday, Embassy observers </p><p>remain skeptical that any major events will take place over </p><p>the weekend.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
