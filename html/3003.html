<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001242 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: JOURNALISTS\' COURT APPEARANCE POSTPONED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) A Harare magistrate has postponed the hearing </p><p>    for two journalists arrested on May 1 for "publishing </p><p>    falsehoods." "Guardian" correspondent Andrew Meldrum </p><p>    (an American citizen) and "Daily News" reporter Lloyd </p><p>    Mudiwa appeared in court on May 22, expecting their </p><p>    case would be heard.  Instead, the magistrate postponed </p><p>    the hearing to May 30.  Both reporters face charges </p><p>    related to a now-disproven story about a woman beheaded </p><p>    by ruling party supporters. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Harare-based journalists have told us that </p><p>    the presiding magistrate finds no merit in the charges </p><p>    against Meldrum and Mudiwa and wants to dismiss the </p><p>    case, but has been prevented from doing so by high- </p><p>    level political pressure. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
