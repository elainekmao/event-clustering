<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003050 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- A lead story in all papers today, May 22, </p><p>highlights America\'s "strong" warning of potential </p><p>attacks in the near future.  Same story reports the </p><p>arrest of three Moroccans in Saudi Arabia for planning </p><p>to hijack a plane for suicide bombing purposes against </p><p>Saudi targets.  Stories also report on President </p><p>Bush\'s "intended" visit to the region.  Reports on </p><p>preparations for the Jordanian parliamentary elections </p><p>continue, with the majority of commentaries hoping for </p><p>and expecting transparent and democratic elections. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The mass graves!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Hilmi Al-Asmar, writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (05/22):  "Finally, we `discovered\' mass </p><p>graves in Iraq.  Piles of skeletons and human bones </p><p>are shown on televisions, where bereaved families and </p><p>orphans stand looking, trying to identify their lost </p><p>loved ones.  A heartbreaking scene.  But, Saddam </p><p>Hussein was not the only dictator in the world, and </p><p>mass graves is not an Iraqi invention..  The mass </p><p>graves of Iraq are similarly found in many parts of </p><p>this wretched earth.  No one remembers those others </p><p>and no one mentions `civil rights\' and `human rights\' </p><p>until these issues have some relationship with serving </p><p>Israel or oil.  And here stands Palestine, a living </p><p>witness to the ugliness of the `world order\'." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
