HANOI 1340  B. HCMC 0632 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH IN HCMC AND HUE AS </p><p>POLICE MAINTAINED TIGHT SURVEILLANCE OVER SEVERAL PAGODAS </p><p>WHOSE RESIDENTS INCLUDE MONKS LOYAL TO THE BANNED UNIFIED </p><p>BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV).  UBCV MONKS FROM </p><p>VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN SOUTHERN VIETNAM HAD PLANNED TO </p><p>CONGREGATE IN CENTRAL QUANG NGAI PROVINCE ON JUNE 7 IN </p><p>DEFIANCE OF GOVERNMENT PROHIBITIONS (SEE REF B AND </p><p>PREVIOUS).

(U) THICH QUANG DO, THE SECOND-RANKING MONK IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00684  01 OF 03  070943Z </p><p>OUTLAWED UBCV, HAD NOTIFIED GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES THAT HE </p><p>WOULD LEAD A DELEGATION OF MONKS TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE ON </p><p>JUNE 7 WITH THE PURPOSE OF TAKING UBCV PATRIARCH THICH </p><p>HUYEN QUANG BACK TO HIS HOME PAGODA IN HCMC.  HUYEN QUANG </p><p>HAS BEEN CONFINED TO AN ISOLATED PAGODA IN CENTRAL VIETNAM </p><p>SINCE 1982.  MONKS, INCLUDING THICH QUANG DO, WHO HAVE </p><p>VISITED THE 83-YEAR-OLD HUYEN QUANG, HAVE NOTED A MARKED </p><p>DETERIORATION IN THE PATRIARCH\'S HEALTH OVER THE PAST </p><p>TWELVE MONTHS.  THEY ARE CONCERNED OVER THE LACK OF </p><p>MEDICAL FACILITIES IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, AND NOTING THAT </p><p>HIS TERM OF DETENTION WAS OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED IN 1997, </p><p>HAVE URGED OFFICIALS TO ALLOW QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC. </p><p>(NOTE: IN DECEMBER 1999, OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY OFFERED TO </p><p>ALLOW HUYEN QUANG TO BE RELOCATED TO HANOI WHERE QUALITY </p><p>MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE.  QUANG REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>THEM HE WOULD NEVER GO TO HANOI.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED </p><p>DELEGATION OF UBCV MONKS TO TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, </p><p>POLICE ENTERED THICH QUANG DO\'S THANH MINH ZEN PAGODA IN </p><p>HCMC ON JUNE 1 AND READ A GOVERNMENT DECISION TO PLACE HIM </p><p>UNDER A TWO-YEAR ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION (HOUSE ARREST) </p><p>ORDER.  POLICE ALSO CUT THE PHONE LINES TO THE PAGODA. </p><p>POLOFF SPOKE WITH PENELOPE FAULKNER, OF THE UBCV\'S </p><p>INFORMATION OFFICE IN PARIS ON JUNE 3.  SHE SAID THAT HER </p><p>CONTACTS IN HCMC REPORT THAT QUANG DO IS CONFINED TO HIS </p><p>LIVING QUARTERS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE PAGODA.  NO ONE </p><p>EXCEPT POLICE OFFICERS HAS HAD DIRECT ACCESS TO HIM SINCE </p><p>JUNE 1.  SEVERAL NON-UNIFORMED POLICE MAINTAIN A PRESENCE </p><p>OUTSIDE HIS ROOM IN THE PAGODA.  WHENEVER POLICE ENTER HIS </p><p>ROOM, ACCORDING TO FAULKNER\'S CONTACTS, THEY DO SO TWO AT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00684  01 OF 03  070943Z </p><p>A TIME IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT NEITHER OF THEM COOPERATES </p><p>WITH HIM TO SMUGGLE OUT MESSAGES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE SCHEDULED TIME FOR DEPARTURE OF THE </p><p>DELEGATION TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE WAS 10:00 A.M. ON JUNE </p><p>7.  POLOFF DROVE DIRECTLY BY THE PAGODA AT 9:55 A.M.  AT </p><p>THAT TIME, THE GATES TO THE PAGODA WERE OPEN, BUT THE AREA </p><p>BEHIND THE GATES LEADING TO THE ENTRANCEWAY TO THE PAGODA </p><p>AND THE LIVING QUARTERS WAS EMPTY.  TWO PERSONS WHO MAY </p><p>HAVE BEEN PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN SAT AT A COFFEE SHOP </p><p>ACROSS THE STREET.  THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>EUROPEAN MP ARRESTED AND DEPORTED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) OLIVIER DUPUIS, A BELGIAN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, ENTERED THE PAGODA ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 7. </p><p>HE REPORTEDLY PLANNED TO STAGE A SIT-IN DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>SYMPATHY WITH QUANG DO.  PLAINCLOTHES POLICE ALLOWED HIM </p><p>TO STAY IN THE PAGODA FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, BUT THEN TOOK </p><p>HIM BACK TO HIS HOTEL IN A "MILITARY VAN," ACCORDING TO </p><p>ONE WITNESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) BUT DUPUIS, WHO IS ALSO SECRETARY OF THE ITALIAN- </p><p>BASED TRANSNATIONAL RADICAL PARTY, WAS NOT DISSUADED.  HE </p><p>REPORTEDLY RETURNED TO THE PAGODA IN THE LATE AFTERNOON </p><p>WITH AN ASSISTANT, MARTIN SCHULTES, AND UNFURLED A BANNER </p><p>THAT SAID "RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR VIETNAM" IN BOTH ENGLISH </p><p>AND VIETNAMESE.  POLICE THEN DETAINED BOTH DUPUIS AND </p><p>SCHULTES AND EXPELLED THEM FROM THE COUNTRY.  THE BELGIAN </p><p>EMBASSY WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY IF EITHER DUPUIS OR SCHULTES </p><p>WERE EVER OFFICIALLY "ARRESTED" OR "DEPORTED," BUT AN </p><p>OFFICER AT THE EMBASSY DID CONFIRM TO POLOFF THAT </p><p>IMMIGRATION POLICE ESCORTED DUPUIS FROM HIS HOTEL TO </p><p>HCMC\'S TAN SON NHUT AIRPORT, AND HE LEFT THE COUNTRY AT </p><p>ABOUT 9:00 P.M. ON JUNE 7. </p><p> </p><p>ANXIETY AT HCMC PAGODAS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IN THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 7, CONGEN CALLED THE AN </p><p>QUANG PAGODA IN HCMC, THE HOME PAGODA OF THICH HUYEN </p><p>QUANG, AND ASKED FOR THICH TAM AN, A MONK WHO REPORTEDLY </p><p>HAD BEEN DETAINED BY POLICE THE DAY BEFORE.  THE PERSON </p><p>WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE SAID THAT IF WE WISHED TO TALK WITH </p><p>TAM AN, WE SHOULD GO THERE IN PERSON AND THEN ABRUPTLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00684  02 OF 03  070944Z </p><p>HUNG UP THE PHONE.  WE THEN CALLED THE RESIDENTIAL NUMBER </p><p>OF THICH TRI QUANG, WHO ALSO LIVES AT AN QUANG PAGODA AND </p><p>IS ONE OF THE THREE RANKING MONKS OF THE OFFICIAL BUDDHIST </p><p>ASSOCIATION IN HCMC.  TRI QUANG SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF </p><p>ANY ATTEMPTS BY MONKS TO GO TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE THAT </p><p>MORNING.  HE SAID THAT THICH TAM AN WAS PRESENT AT THE </p><p>PAGODA BUT, AS OF JUNE 4, HE WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COME TO </p><p>THE PHONE AT THE MOMENT (REF A).  CONGEN ALSO CALLED THICH </p><p>HIEN PHAP, ANOTHER OF THE THREE RANKING MONKS OF THE </p><p>OFFICIAL BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION WITH WHOM WE HAVE MET </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE.  PHAP, WHO HAS IN THE PAST BEEN </p><p>WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE UBCV, SEEMED ANNOYED BY OUR </p><p>INQUIRIES AND SAID HE KNEW NOTHING MORE ABOUT THICH QUANG </p><p>DO AND THE UBCV PROBLEMS THAN WHAT WAS REPORTED ON </p><p>TELEVISION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) CONGEN CALLED THE XA LOI PAGODA IN HCMC.  AT ONE </p><p>NUMBER, THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE SUGGESTED WE </p><p>CALL BACK LATER.  WHEN WE CALLED AN HOUR LATER, NO ONE </p><p>ANSWERED THE PHONE.  AT ANOTHER NUMBER, THE PERSON WHO </p><p>ANSWERED THE PHONE BECAME ANGRY AT OUR INQUIRIES.  HE SAID </p><p>NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS HAPPENING AT THE PAGODA AND SUGGESTED </p><p>WE SHOULD PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) CONGEN ALSO CALLED CAO DAI AND CATHOLIC CONTACTS </p><p>WHO LIKELY WOULD BE AWARE OF THE UBCV SITUATION.  THESE </p><p>CONTACTS, WHO HAVE NEVER HESITATED TO TALK OVER THE </p><p>TELEPHONE BEFORE, SAID THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO MEET </p><p>POLOFF, BUT DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK OVER THE PHONE. </p><p>LIKEWISE, POLOFF WAS ABLE TO REACH THE HCMC-BASED UBCV </p><p>MONK WHO DEPARTED HCMC ON JUNE 1 FOR QUANG NGAI.  HE IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00684  02 OF 03  070944Z </p><p>BACK IN HCMC, BUT SAID IT WAS "TOO DANGEROUS" TO SPEAK </p><p>OVER THE TELEPHONE.  (NOTE: POLOFF PLANS TO MEET WITH THIS </p><p>CONTACT AS SOON AS TIME PERMITS.  HE RESIDES IN ONE OF THE </p><p>RURAL DISTRICTS, LOCATED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CITY. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>TENSIONS IN HUE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) CONGEN WAS UNABLE TO REACH THICH THAI HOA AT THE </p><p>TU HIEU PAGODA IN HUE CITY.  ALL PHONE LINES TO THE PAGODA </p><p>HAVE NOW BEEN CUT. (REF A REPORTED THAT THAI HOA\'S </p><p>RESIDENTIAL NUMBER WAS OUT OF SERVICE, BUT THE TWO LINES </p><p>TO THE MAIN PAGODA WERE STILL WORKING.)  THE LINES TO </p><p>PHUOC THANH PAGODA AND THIEN LAM PAGODA ARE SIMILARLY OUT </p><p>OF SERVICE.  THE LINE TO BAO QUOC PAGODA WAS OUT OF </p><p>SERVICE, BUT CONGEN WAS ABLE TO GET THROUGH ON ANOTHER </p><p>NUMBER.  POLOFF ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THICH THIEN HANH, WHO </p><p>REPORTEDLY HAD BEEN CALLED IN FOR QUESTIONING BY POLICE A </p><p>FEW DAYS EARLIER.  THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE ASKED </p><p>US TO CALL BACK AGAIN IN TEN MINUTES.  WE CALLED </p><p>REPEATEDLY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT NO ONE PICKED UP </p><p>THE RECEIVER AT THE OTHER END. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) CONGEN ALSO CALLED THE CHAU LAM PAGODA IN HUE, </p><p>THE RESIDENCE OF THICH PHUOC VIEN, ONE OF THOSE WHO </p><p>REPORTEDLY PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI.  WHEN WE ASKED </p><p>TO SPEAK WITH PHUOC VIEN, THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE </p><p>PHONE ENGAGED IN A LONG CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE ELSE </p><p>PRESENT AT THE PAGODA BEFORE ANSWERING.  HE THEN TOLD US </p><p>TO CALL BACK IN TEN MINUTES.  TEN MINUTES LATER, AND </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THAT, THE PHONE WENT UNANSWERED.  WHEN </p><p>SOMEONE FINALLY ANSWERED THE PHONE, WE WERE TOLD THAT </p><p>THICH PHUOC VIEN WAS BUSY AND UNABLE TO TALK WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) AT LONG QUAN PAGODA IN HUE, THE PERSON WHO </p><p>ANSWERED THE TELEPHONE ENGAGED IN A CURIOUS CONVERSATION. </p><p>WHEN WE ASKED A QUESTION, HE HESITATED FOR A LONG TIME, </p><p>THEN ASKED WHY WE WERE ASKING ABOUT THE UBCV, THEN </p><p>HESITATED SOME MORE.  AFTER HE TALKED WITH SOMEONE ELSE </p><p>WHO APPARENTLY WAS PRESENT IN THE ROOM WITH HIM, HE </p><p>SHOUTED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE AND THEN HUNG UP THE </p><p>PHONE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) A MONK AT PHUOC DUYEN PAGODA IN HUE SAID POLICE </p><p>HAD BEEN PRESENT ON THE PAGODA\'S GROUNDS UNTIL 11:30 P.M. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00684  03 OF 03  070944Z </p><p>THE NIGHT BEFORE.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN CALLED IN FOR </p><p>QUESTIONING AT THE POLICE STATION IN THE MORNING.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT POLICE HAD ALSO CALLED IN THICH CHI THANH (FROM THE </p><p>PHUOC THANH PAGODA), THICH THIEN HANH (FROM THE BAO QUOC </p><p>PAGODA), AND THICH CHI MAU.  THE MONK AT PHUOC DUYEN </p><p>PAGODA SAID HE AND 30 TO 40 OTHER MONKS FROM HUE STILL </p><p>PLANNED TO GO TO QUANG NGAI, BUT THAT CAR AND TAXI OWNERS </p><p>WERE TOO AFRAID TO PROVIDE VEHICLES FOR THEM.  SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION, HE SAID THE SITUATION IN </p><p>HUE WAS "EXTREMELY TENSE" AND THE MONKS WERE "ANGRY." </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) MEANWHILE, A UBCV PRESS RELEASE FROM PARIS SAID </p><p>THAT POLICE HAVE SURROUNDED THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S RESIDENCE </p><p>IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, AND "UBCV MEMBERS TRYING TO VISIT </p><p>HIM HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) CLOSE POLICE SURVEILLANCE OF UBCV MONKS LIKELY </p><p>WILL PREVENT ANY OF THEM FROM MEETING WITH THICH HUYEN </p><p>QUANG FOR THE TIME BEING.  THEIR SUCCESS IN SEALING OFF </p><p>HUYEN QUANG, HOWEVER, MAY ONLY ADD TO THE FRUSTRATION AND </p><p>RESENTMENT OF HIS SUPPORTERS (WHO ARE SIZABLE IN NUMBER). </p><p>FURTHERMORE, VIETNAM IS STILL LEFT WITH THE PROBLEM OF AN </p><p>AGING UBCV PATRIARCH IN AN ISOLATED PAGODA IN QUANG NGAI </p><p>PROVINCE.  SHOULD HIS HEALTH EVENTUALLY FAIL HIM WHILE </p><p>STILL IN DETENTION IN THIS REMOTE PROVINCE, THE TENSIONS </p><p>OF RECENT DAYS MAY SEEM MILD IN COMPARISON. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00684  03 OF 03  070944Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
