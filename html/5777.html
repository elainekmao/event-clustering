<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOE JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush abusing his office" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its February 18 editorial to declaring </p><p>      that the current standoff between the United </p><p>      States and Iraq is about the control of Iraqi </p><p>      oil.  "(President George W.) Bush and his </p><p>      Chihuahuas. . .want to persecute the people of </p><p>      Iraq for their oil under the cover of human </p><p>      rights," the editorial stated.  Adding "If </p><p>      anything, we believe that it is the American </p><p>      President who is guilty of abusing his office, </p><p>      imposing his will on the rest of us and grossly </p><p>      violating human rights."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Those who espouse democracy would say that its </p><p>      major tenet is the happiness of the greater number. </p><p>      We believe that those who want to work against the </p><p>      happiness of the greater number would largely be </p><p>      viewed as dictators or autocrats.  We refer to the </p><p>      unyielding stance taken by the President of the United </p><p>      States, George W. Bush, who seems intent on defying </p><p>      world opinion in his quest to pursue a parochial </p><p>      agenda of war.  Bush and his Chihuahuas, among them </p><p>      Tony Blair and John Howard, want to persecute the </p><p>      people of Iraq for their oil under the cover of human </p><p>      rights.  The world knows why Iraq is so important to </p><p>      American foreign policy.  There is no need for Bush to </p><p>      throw a blanket over world opinion because the crux of </p><p>      the matter is that America is fighting to control </p><p>      Iraqi oil and President Saddam Hussein stands accused </p><p>      of standing in the way of that American dream.  We </p><p>      believe the Americans should come clean on their </p><p>      involvement in the Middle East, where they are </p><p>      selective about the application of human rights.  If </p><p>      anything, we believe that it is the American President </p><p>      who is guilty of abusing his office, imposing his will </p><p>      on the rest of us and grossly violating human rights. </p><p> </p><p>      "If there were elections to send criminals of </p><p>      war to the International Court of Justice, we </p><p>      believe that the world would have voted </p><p>      unanimously through the international protests </p><p>      directed at Bush et al.  The verdict would be a </p><p>      foregone conclusion.  It is about time that real </p><p>      criminals were taken to the Court because the </p><p>      world could do better without them.  We are yet </p><p>      to see whether Bush and his boys will go ahead </p><p>      with their war plan against a defiant world </p><p>      opinion that believes life is more important </p><p>      than oil.  This will confirm a view that we have </p><p>      long held, that, to quote London Mayor Ken </p><p>      Livingstone; `George Bush has never given a damn </p><p>      about human rights.\'  The `war\' is about oil." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
