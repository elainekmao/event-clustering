<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 009055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IR, KICT, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>TURKEY REGARDING IRANIAN TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) SECSTATE 191487 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 7270 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (C) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson. </p><p>Reason:1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action recommendation - para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Per ref B, GOT MFA has provided Embassy with court </p><p>documents involving two cases purportedly establishing and </p><p>illustrating Iranian support for terrorism in Turkey.  These </p><p>cases are in the public domain; the documents, in the </p><p>original Turkish, will be sent to Department via pouch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to the MFA, the cases were adjudicated </p><p>before Ankara State Security Court No.2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- One case (documents provided by MFA are dated July 2002) </p><p>alleges a relationship between Iran and the Tevhid Group.  It </p><p>refers to the murders of Ugur Mumcu, Bahriye Ucok, Muammer </p><p>Aksoy, Ahmet Taner Kisali, Abdulgani Bedevi, Victor Deam </p><p>Marwick, Ehud Sadan, and Kaya Kaman.  The case involves </p><p>alleged confessions by perpetrators establishing their </p><p>relations with Iranian intelligence personnel in Ankara and </p><p>Iran.  The verdict is pending; according to the MFA, no date </p><p>has been set for final decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The other case, brought in 1997, purports to demonstrate </p><p>ties between Iran and the "Turkish" Hizbullah, a largely </p><p>Kurdish group operating in southeastern Turkey.  The case </p><p>makes reference to the notorious events of January 31, 1997 </p><p>in Sincan muncipality of Ankara, at which Islamists attending </p><p>a "Jerusalem Night" rally supported the then Iranian </p><p>Ambassador\'s public criticism of the secularist Turkish </p><p>State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite MFA\'s assurances that the cases are admissable </p><p>in other, international court proceedings, there are </p><p>potential procedural questions which argue against the USG\'s </p><p>using these cases in international fora.  The Tevhid case </p><p>may, for example, include uncertainties as to whether police </p><p>methods used to extract confessions were legal.  As for the </p><p>"Turkish" Hizbullah case, we note that the "Jerusalem Night" </p><p>events in question became the focal point of the "February 28 </p><p>Process" -- the military-orchestrated ouster later that year </p><p>of the then Islamist-led government of Turkey -- and the </p><p>start of what is widely regarded as Turkey\'s "post-modern" </p><p>coup d\'etat.  As such, it probably reflects in part the MFA\'s </p><p>diplomatic defense to the world of Turkish State efforts to </p><p>control or interfere with elected civilian governments having </p><p>Islamic coloration -- and is thus even more problematic </p><p>regarding both the utility of such a case and its </p><p>implications for USG-GOT relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action recommended: with regard to para 4, post </p><p>recommends against USG including these materials in any </p><p>action before the Hague (per ref A) regarding Iranian support </p><p>for terrorism. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
