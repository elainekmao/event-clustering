<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003217 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>(CORRECTED COPY - PARA NUMBERS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, US, XF, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 24 SPEECH </p><p>ON THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 122320 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03217  051609Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL MC GARY ROBBINS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: THE GOI INITIALLY EXPRESSED GENERAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 24 SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>TEMPERED WITH CONCERN OVER ARAFAT\'S ROLE.  AFTER THE G8 </p><p>SUMMIT, WHERE PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI HAD A CHANCE TO </p><p>SPEAK WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND WAS REPORTEDLY "OVERWHELMED" BY </p><p>THE EVIDENCE LINKING ARAFAT AND THE PA TO TERRORISM, </p><p>BERLUSCONI CHANGED HIS STAND ON ARAFAT.  HE HAS NOW SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT ARAFAT STEP DOWN AS LEADER OF THE PA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) MFA SOURCES EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 24 SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE EAST, SAYING IT </p><p>REFLECTED US WILLINGNESS TO COMMIT TO REACTIVATING THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS IN THE REGION.  MFA SOURCES ALSO NOTED THE POINTS OF </p><p>CONVERGENCE WITH THE EU\'S POSITION AT THE EU COUNCIL IN </p><p>SEVILLE JUNE 21-22: TWO STATES, STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM, </p><p>AND END OF OCCUPATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) MFA SOURCES AGREED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT AND URGENT TO </p><p>HOLD ELECTIONS IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  THEY STRESSED </p><p>HOWEVER THAT ONLY THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>CHOOSE THEIR LEADERSHIP.  SPEAKING PUBLICLY ON JUNE 25, </p><p>ALFREDO MANTICA, THE MFA\'S UNDER SECRETARY FOR AFRICA AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, SAID "UNDOUBTEDLY, FOR THE AMERICANS TO CHOOSE </p><p>ARAFAT AS A CONDITION FOR NON-PEACE IS A RISK.  THIS WILL </p><p>CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR BUSH WITH MANY EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS </p><p>WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION.  EVEN WE ITALIANS HAVE </p><p>REITERATED THAT ARAFAT IS THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION AND THAT ONLY THE PALESTINIANS CAN </p><p>CHOSE THEIR REPRESENTATIVE". </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03217  051609Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) BERLUSCONI ECHOED MANTICA\'S VIEWS RIGHT BEFORE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE G8 SUMMIT IN KANANASKIS.  SPEAKING TO </p><p>JOURNALISTS JUNE 26, HE SAID: "ARAFAT CERTAINLY IS AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE THE ELECTED LEADER OF THE PALESTINIANS."  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A SPECIFIC QUESTION HOWEVER, BERLUSCONI SAID HE </p><p>WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY WHETHER ARAFAT IS AN OBSTACLE THAT MUST </p><p>BE REMOVED ONLY AFTER SPEAKING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH.  ONE DAY </p><p>LATER, AFTER THE DINNER WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND BEING </p><p>REPORTEDLY OVERWHELMED BY THE INFORMATION LINKING ARAFAT AND </p><p>THE PA TO TERRORISM, BERLUSCONI INVITED ARAFAT TO STEP ASIDE: </p><p>"IF I WERE ARAFAT, I WOULD MAKE THE GREAT GESTURE THAT WOULD </p><p>CONSECRATE HIM TO HISTORY AS A MAN WHO DID EVERYTHING FOR HIS </p><p>COUNTRY."  BERLUSCONI WAS REPORTEDLY THE ONLY EUROPEAN LEADER </p><p>TO STATE THAT ARAFAT SHOULD STEP DOWN FOR THE GOOD OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: WHY SUCH A METAMORPHOSIS IN BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>POSITION?  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS INDEED PERSUADED BY </p><p>EVIDENCE LINKING ARAFAT TO TERRORISM.  IT IS MORE LIKELY, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT BERLUSCONI SAW IN THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF THE US WHEN SOME OTHER EU LEADERS, AND SOME KEY </p><p>OFFICIALS WITHIN HIS OWN MFA, HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE US </p><p>POSITION ON ARAFAT.  BERLUSCONI, WHO IS STILL ACTING FM, </p><p>CONTINUES TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE IS ONE </p><p>OF OUR GREATEST SUPPORTERS IN THE EU.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
