<p>S E C R E T ROME 001734 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, KNNP, KN, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DPRK/SARS: ODDS AND ENDS FROM THE GOI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM TOM COUNTRYMAN. REASON:1.5 (B)(D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) DURING A CATCH-UP SESSION, THE MFA DEPUTY OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR EAST ASIA, PAOLA MUNZI (STRICTLY PROTECT), </p><p>    REVEALED TO POLOFF SOME INTERESTING TIDBITS ABOUT THE DPRK, </p><p>SARS, AND THE GOI, AS WELL AS HER FUTURE POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) ACCORDING TO MUNZI, THE DPRK HAS MADE A SERIES OF ODD </p><p>REQUESTS OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS TO THE GOI.  THE FIRST, </p><p>FAXED TO HER OFFICE, WAS FOR A SPECIFIC BOLOGNA-BASED TEAM OF </p><p>POTATO EXPERTS TO COME TO NORTH KOREA FOR CONSULTATIONS.  NOT </p><p>SEEING ANY HARM, THE GOI APPROVED THE VISIT.  THE SECOND </p><p>REQUEST WAS FOR A COPY OF A 1933 NON-AGGRESSION TREATY </p><p>BETWEEN ITALY AND VARIOUS CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  WHEN </p><p>PRESSED A BIT ON THIS SHE WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER IF IT HAD BEEN </p><p>GIVEN TO THEM JUST YET, OR WHICH COUNTRIES EXACTLY IT APPLIED </p><p>TO, ALTHOUGH SHE SAID ARCHIVISTS WERE RESEARCHING THE </p><p>REQUEST.  THE GOI IS WILLING TO HELP THE NORTH KOREANS LOCATE </p><p>A COPY OF THE TREATY, VIEWING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE </p><p>THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH THEY REALIZE IT IS PECULIAR AND ARE NOT </p><p>SURE HOW THE DPRK INTENDS TO BENEFIT FROM POSSESSING A COPY. </p><p>(COMMENT: AN EIGHTY-YEAR OLD, MUSSOLINI-ERA TREATY MIGHT NOT </p><p>BE THE BEST OPTION IF THE DPRK IS ATTEMPTING TO CRAFT A </p><p>MODERN NON-AGGRESSION PACT.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) MUNZI WELCOMED THE RECENT U.S.-DPRK TALKS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SHE MENTIONED THERE WAS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT AMONG EU MEMBERS </p><p>THAT THEY WERE NOT YET PLAYING A ROLE.  HOWEVER, SHE STATED </p><p>THE GOI WAS PLEASED WITH THE "MULTILATERAL" NATURE OF THE </p><p>TALKS AND THE WILLINGNESS OF BOTH SIDES TO BEND SLIGHTLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  SHE NOTED THAT SARS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTING </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL GOI TRIPS TO ASIA.  ACCORDING TO MUNZI, PRESIDENT </p><p>CIAMPI\'S APRIL VISIT TO BEIJING, SUPPOSEDLY CANCELED DUE TO </p><p>THE IRAQ WAR, WAS IN REALITY SHELVED DUE TO FEARS OF THE SARS </p><p>    VIRUS.  THIS APPLIED AS WELL TO A PLANNED VISIT BY MARGHERITA </p><p>BONIVER, UNDER-SECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL </p><p>AS A WIDE-VARIETY OF OTHER TRIPS NOW LANGUISHING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION MS. MUNZI MENTIONED </p><p>SHE HAD RECENTLY MARRIED A TIBETAN NATIONAL (KNOWN TO POLOFF) </p><p>AND WAS LIKELY TO LEAVE ROME IN LATE SUMMER FOR THE NUMBER </p><p>TWO POSITION IN ITALY\'S NEW YORK CONSULATE, ALTHOUGH THAT HAD </p><p>NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.  HER HUSBAND, RECIPIENT OF A FORD </p><p>FOUNDATION GRANT, EXPECTS TO BEGIN HIS MASTER\'S DEGREE AT SIT </p><p>IN VERMONT, ASSUMING HE RECEIVES A STUDENT VISA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) PRIOR TO HER CURRENT POSITION, MUNZI WAS ON THE MFA </p><p>WORKING GROUP FOR ANTARCTICA IN 2001-2002, IN THE MFA </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION BUREAU, OFFICE FOR EAST/WEST AFRICA </p><p>IN 1999-2001, WAS FIRST SECRETARY AND COUNSELOR FOR </p><p>COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS IN HARARE 1994-1999, AND SERVED AS FIRST </p><p>VICE-CONSUL AND CONSUL IN BARCELONA 1991-1994.  SHE WAS BORN </p><p>MAY 26, 1963 IN ROME, AND GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN </p><p>POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ROME IN JULY OF </p><p>1985.  SHE JOINED THE FOREIGN SERVICE IN 1987 AND SERVED HER </p><p>INITIAL TOUR FROM 1987-1991 IN THE MFA OFFICE FOR EAST-WEST </p><p>RELATIONS, THE FORMER USSR, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01734 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
