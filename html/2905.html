<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/6/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OPPOSITION PARTIES TALK MERGER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1324 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In reporting President Obasanjo\'s formal </p><p>announcement to seek reelection, reftel forecasted that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s statement would force his opponents to respond. </p><p>His political adversaries wasted little time making that </p><p>prediction come true. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Most major daily newspapers have been reporting that </p><p>the APP and the yet-to-be-registered UNDP have been </p><p>immersed in merger talks since Obasanjo declared his </p><p>reelection bid. Significant progress has been made and the </p><p>conclusion of a formal agreement appears imminent.  It is </p><p>possible that the NDP might also join the merger.  If that </p><p>were to happen, it would create a potentially significant </p><p>rival to the ruling PDP in the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Yaya Abubakar, a businessman, the </p><p>merger might be formalized this week. As part of the deal, </p><p>the existing party chairmen would resign, making way for a </p><p>new person not publicly affiliated with any of the existing </p><p>parties to emerge. The new chairman would likely be from </p><p>the Southwest. The way then would be open for the new party </p><p>to nominate a Presidential candidate from the North and a </p><p>running mate from the Southeast. The simultaneous </p><p>resignation of both (or all three) chairmen would create an </p><p>impression of a merger of equals. But Abubakar said the </p><p>entire deal could yet fall apart since each outgoing </p><p>chairman was trying to retain influence by picking the </p><p>(unified) successor chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: A North/Southeast ticket would replicate </p><p>the winning formula in past elections. Additionally, this </p><p>partially responds to the noisy clamor from the Igboland </p><p>for a President of their own. Dangling the Vice Presidency </p><p>before them might attract Igbos who feel estranged from the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration and do not see much hope about </p><p>wresting the top job in the PDP since Vice President Atiku </p><p>is a Northerner. These Igbos might see the Vice Presidency </p><p>in 2003 as the stepping stone to the Presidency in 2007 or </p><p>2011. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Abubakar said that a recurring theme in the talks </p><p>among APP, UNDP and NDP was the need for a younger man to </p><p>assume the Presidency, someone under 50, someone such as </p><p>himself. Abubakar offered that there was some support for </p><p>airline owner Mohammed Buba Marwa, a retired brigadier </p><p>general and former military governor of Borno and Lagos </p><p>states. However, many discussants were sour on naming a </p><p>former military leader. They feared the electorate would </p><p>draw little distinction between them and the PDP if they </p><p>tapped another retired military officer to face former </p><p>General Obasanjo. However, Marwa was still a possibility as </p><p>his popularity in Lagos intrigued many of those in the </p><p>merger talks who want to hit Obasanjo, a Yoruba, hard in </p><p>his own electoral backyard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment: Some Northern powerbrokers are considering </p><p>trying to nominate an elderly Igbo (e.g., Alex Ekwueme) or </p><p>southern minority leader (e.g., C.C. Onoh) as the </p><p>Presidential candidate while bringing in a young Northerner </p><p>to run things behind the scenes as Vice President.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) During a May 1 conversation with PolCouns, National </p><p>Assembly Member Farouk Lawal confirmed that the President\'s </p><p>opponents have been talking feverishly. Lawal, allied with </p><p>Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba as an Obasanjo foe within the PDP, </p><p>stated the opposition had been stymied by its inability to </p><p>find a credible consensus figure. Stoked by the President\'s </p><p>reelection declaration, sentiment for unity in the </p><p>opposition was at its crest. Lawal predicted opposition </p><p>forces had only a few weeks to select a candidate and </p><p>execute the formal merger. After that, centrifugal forces </p><p>of regionalism, religion and personal ambition would begin </p><p>to supercede the mutual opposition to Obasanjo, Lawal </p><p>remarked. He added that already Obasanjo operatives were </p><p>trying to sow discord among the participants in the merger </p><p>talks. Lawal asserted that if the parties do formally </p><p>merge, there likely would be a mass exodus of Obasanjo </p><p>opponents from the PDP to the new creation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: That the parties have moved so quickly in </p><p>the merger talks illustrates the significance of the </p><p>opposition to an Obasanjo second term. However, the fine </p><p>points still pending to consummate the deal show the </p><p>difficulty in fusing divergent interests into an ABOP -- </p><p>Anybody But Obasanjo Party. With former Head of State </p><p>Babangida second-in-command Augustus Aikhomu leading the </p><p>UNDP team, this development seems to have IBB\'s blessing, </p><p>if not his behind the scenes involvement. We heard from one </p><p>source that IBB was orchestrating this amalgam not to fight </p><p>Obasanjo but to form a party big enough to thwart former </p><p>Head of State Buhari\'s attempt to steam-roll the APP </p><p>nomination. Buhari\'s dislike of IBB is legendary, and IBB </p><p>clearly has more to fear from a Buhari first term than from </p><p>Obasanjo\'s retention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Regardless of the primary intention behind the </p><p>merger, it could pose a serious threat to Obasanjo if it </p><p>jells and selects a formidable candidate.  The claim that </p><p>the prospective party wants a new face and wants to break </p><p>from the past rings hollow. The manner in which the party </p><p>is being formed and the attempt of a select group of </p><p>powerbrokers to pick the presidential candidate smack of </p><p>traditional Nigerian politics. Basically, this is a move by </p><p>Northern politicians, stung by what they feel has been </p><p>Obasanjo\'s disregard for their station and their support in </p><p>the 1999 election, to regain control of national politics. </p><p>In the end, with so many of the established players </p><p>involved and assuming their familiar roles as backroom </p><p>bargainers, this attempted merger appears to be the same </p><p>old card game played on a refurbished table. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
