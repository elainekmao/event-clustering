<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000875 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: STRONG ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT TO ASSESS </p><p>YEMEN\'S ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 818 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SANAA 706 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Yemen\'s parliamentary election April 27 (refs </p><p>and septel) will benefit from a well-organized election </p><p>observation effort that will assess its outcome.  Encouraged </p><p>by the ROYG, political parties and NGOs, more than 30,000 </p><p>international and domestic observers will deploy on election </p><p>day.  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) will field the </p><p>only official international delegation and plans to issue a </p><p>statement on April 29.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In an event striking for its contrast with some </p><p>other country leaders who discourage or disallow independent </p><p>election observation, President Saleh hosted a televised </p><p>event for all international observers at the Presidential </p><p>compound on April 23.  President Saleh welcomed the observers </p><p>and said that Yemen has "attempted to learn from other </p><p>democratic experiments" and has worked hard to improve </p><p>election administration.  He described efforts to ensure a </p><p>peaceful election and said that Yemen is committed to </p><p>democratic development.  When challenged about the </p><p>disappointing number of women candidates running for </p><p>election, he encouraged all voters to elect women and </p><p>admitted that Yemen had to work harder on women,s inclusion </p><p>in political life while noting the difficulties involved </p><p>culturally in doing so.   One National Democratic Institute </p><p>(NDI) observer told Pol/Econoff that she was "pleasantly </p><p>surprised" to get such a welcome after her observation </p><p>experience in Zimbabwe, noting that NDI, UNDP and IFES had </p><p>characterized the cooperation between internationals and the </p><p>ROYG during the election process to her as "constructive and </p><p>close" despite some difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The 30-member international delegation from NDI </p><p>arrived in Yemen April 22.  Members from 10 countries, </p><p>including Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, </p><p>comprise the NDI delegation, which includes members of </p><p>parliament, academics, NGO and political party activists, </p><p>journalists and former diplomats (including former U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Yemen Charles Dunbar).   Because of funding </p><p>constraints and security concerns, neither the UN nor the EU </p><p>was able to mount official observation efforts, making NDI,s </p><p>the only official international delegation.  NDI plans to </p><p>issue its statement on the election on April 29. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The NDI delegation will be joined by more informal </p><p>efforts by various embassies, including the U.S.  Post will </p><p>deploy more than 20 observers to constituencies in Sanaa, </p><p>Aden and Hadramaut but plans to keep a low profile, both for </p><p>security reasons and to ensure the multi-country NDI </p><p>delegation remains at the forefront.  Post has closely </p><p>coordinated within the Embassy and with NDI to ensure </p><p>appropriate security coverage for the observers by the ROYG. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  More than 30,000 domestic observers representing </p><p>NGOs, political parties and other actors have obtained </p><p>credentials to examine the election process.  Of these, </p><p>6-10,000 are from non-partisan and experienced NGOs trained </p><p>by NDI, which should add valuable analysis to NDI,s official </p><p>statement. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
