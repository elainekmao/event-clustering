<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, JO, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN CELEBRATES THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN WITH </p><p>         PRAYER AND TREPIDATION </p><p> </p><p>1.    The following cable was drafted by one of our FSNs and </p><p>   conveys  the  mood  of Ramadan 2002 in  Jordan  from  her </p><p>   perspective. </p><p> </p><p>2.    Summary:  While  last year\'s Ramadan was  marked  with </p><p>   pessimism and lethargy, one would have thought  that  the </p><p>   situation wouldn\'t and couldn\'t possibly get worse.  Last </p><p>   year, Jordanians greeted Ramadan with daily fresh images of </p><p>   wounded Palestinians and the added weightiness of the  US </p><p>   campaign in Afghanistan. This year, the mood in Ramadan is </p><p>   one of "accumulated frustration", "further disillusionment", </p><p>   and  "a case of hopelessness". Jordanians see a continued </p><p>   Intifada that seems to be going nowhere; an inevitable war </p><p>   on Iraq; political unrest within Jordan; a sinking economy; </p><p>   and a new war many believe to be targeted at Islam and Arabs </p><p>   at  large.   Faced  with  these  simultaneous  pressures, </p><p>   Jordanians are spending more time in reflection,  and  in </p><p>   mosques.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.    Although this year\'s Ramadan is far from festive,  the </p><p>   mood is not all one of gloom and tension.  Homes and streets </p><p>   are decorated with lanterns and crescents (in the manner of </p><p>   Christmas);  special-made food  items  are  prepared  and </p><p>   fashionably displayed; and cafes and hotels offer Ramadan </p><p>   Iftars and quiz nights at a good price. The King and Queen </p><p>   host  Iftars for the underprivileged, other Royal  Family </p><p>   members  host Iftars for orphans, and donations and  food </p><p>   packages are routed to the poor by the able and fortunate. </p><p>   The streets are emptied at sunset and grid locked after the </p><p>   stomachs are full. Non-Jordanian satellite TV stations host </p><p>   many politicized shows such as Horseman without a Horse -- </p><p>   about resistance to the British and Zionist colonization - </p><p>   which  are  aired in prime time. (Note: Jordan Television </p><p>   (JTV) is not airing this program.  However, Jordanians are </p><p>   able to view it either on the "Al- </p><p>   Manar" or "Dream" satellite stations. End Note.) This  is </p><p>   followed  by the story of Juha, the legendary figure  who </p><p>   represents  the  underdog in society  facing  up  to  the </p><p>   government.  Several lottery shows - increasingly popular - </p><p>   promise  people a chance to win - and offer  a  momentary </p><p>   escape from reality. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Beneath it all, however, people have become cynical and </p><p>   depressed about the reality they are forced to  live.  "I </p><p>   don\'t read the news as much because it\'s the same everyday." </p><p>   "It\'s supposed to be a holy month, but there is nothing holy </p><p>   or  sanctified  about it . . . there  are  still  Israeli </p><p>   incursions  and  deaths everyday. Nothing  has  changed." </p><p>   "People   are   praying  more  because  it   leaves   the </p><p>   responsibility to God to do something". </p><p> </p><p>5.    Consequently, more Jordanians are spending their  time </p><p>   in quiet reflection and prayer. People are less politicized </p><p>   publicly, but their worries and frustration are evident. In </p><p>   contrast to last year, the number of people attending mosque </p><p>   prayers after Iftar has increased dramatically, especially </p><p>   among young women. There are now new facilities that make it </p><p>   easier for women to attend - women can take their children </p><p>   with them and have the mosque management attend to them. The </p><p>   press has featured articles deeming it `wrongful\' for men to </p><p>   stop their wives from going to post Iftar prayers; there\'s a </p><p>   lot of Quran reading and more and more TV shows catering for </p><p>   this religious segment. We have also heard anecdotal reports </p><p>   that  the  number of Jordanians traveling to  Mecca  this </p><p>   Ramadan  to perform Umra has also increased significantly </p><p>   over  previous years. It is well known that in  times  of </p><p>   trouble people turn to religion, and Jordanians have a lot </p><p>   on  their  minds these days as the region inches  towards </p><p>   conflict. </p><p> </p><p>6.     Jordanians  have  somehow  adopted  a  new  level  of </p><p>   normalcy. While Ramadan carries on as usual, beneath it all </p><p>   lies a cautious ennui and trepidation about possible more </p><p>   difficult times to come. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
