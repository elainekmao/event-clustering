<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001580 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ WELCOMES POTUS STATEMENT ON ROADMAP BUT </p><p>COMMENTATORS REMAIN SKEPTICAL; PM CALLS FOR NATIONAL UNITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In what most here see as the final days before the </p><p>beginning of a U.S.-led war against Iraq, senior GOJ </p><p>officials have issued a series of public statements welcoming </p><p>the President\'s March 14 Statement on the Roadmap and calling </p><p>for national unity in the face of imminent challenges.  At </p><p>the same time, the government allowed peaceful anti-war </p><p>demonstrations to take place March 15 in Amman and Irbid </p><p>(septel).  Comments by Embassy contacts and in the local </p><p>press make clear that -- the President\'s statement </p><p>notwithstanding -- most Jordanians remain deeply skeptical </p><p>about U.S. motives and plans for the region.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Welcomes President\'s Roadmap Endorsement </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Soon after the President\'s March 14 Rose Garden </p><p>presentation, King Abdullah and FM Marwan Muasher quickly </p><p>issued public statements welcoming the news that Washington </p><p>would publicize the Roadmap soon after the naming of a </p><p>Palestinian PM.  FM Muasher told the official Petra News </p><p>Service March 14 that "Jordan has constantly called for the </p><p>need to declare a roadmap and start work immediately on its </p><p>execution without any modifications," while the King on March </p><p>15 said "the announcement . . . gives strong momentum to the </p><p>efforts that aim at easing tension and violence in </p><p>Palestinian territories." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Emphasis on National Unity </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) These official comments came a day after statements PM </p><p>Ali Abul Ragheb had made stressing the need for Jordan to </p><p>maintain national cohesion and unity, given the regional </p><p>uncertainties of the moment.  In a March 13 meeting with the </p><p>Secretaries General of Jordan\'s 30 registered political </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>parties, Abul Ragheb stated that "the homeland\'s security and </p><p>stability is a collective responsibility" and called on the </p><p>parties to "carry out their role in making citizens aware of </p><p>the need to behave responsibly."  According to press reports </p><p>of the gathering, the PM told the assembled party heads that </p><p>"Jordan, through its conscious (sic) leadership and the </p><p>joined forces of its institutions and citizens, is able to </p><p>surpass the difficult circumstances imposed by the regional </p><p>situation." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Peaceful Anti-War Marches </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Notwithstanding these statements expressing hope for </p><p>forward movement on the MEPP and confidence in the Kingdom\'s </p><p>inner strength, the GOJ has also recognized the need to allow </p><p>Jordanians to express their opposition to a possible Iraq war </p><p>as a means of managing current internal pressures.  On March </p><p>15, the GOJ allowed large, peaceful demonstrations to be held </p><p>in Amman and Irbid, the country\'s third largest city (details </p><p>septel).  While the gatherings (each numbering in the several </p><p>thousand) were peaceful, the rhetoric was (according to press </p><p>reports and Embassy security contacts) sharp and </p><p>anti-American in tone. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Few Minds Changed Regarding U.S. Plans and Motives </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) An initial check of Embassy contacts and the local </p><p>press indicate that the President\'s 3/14 statement has thus </p><p>far done little to alter the Jordanian public\'s deep </p><p>skepticism about U.S. policy vis-a-vis Iraq or the MEPP.  A </p><p>common sentiment is that the President\'s statement is nothing </p><p>more than a momentary attempt to divert Arab opposition from </p><p>an Iraq war.  One contact told POLFSN "the Roadmap is an </p><p>obvious cover by Bush to look good while he plans to strike </p><p>Iraq."  Another noted "Bush\'s words and promises mean </p><p>nothing," while former Parliamentarian Mahmoud Kharabsheh </p><p>(East Banker) told Poloff "nobody believes this means </p><p>anything." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While the Arabic dailies led with President Bush\'s </p><p>announcement and the King\'s welcoming of it as their lead </p><p>stories, their commentary was deeply skeptical.  A cartoon in </p><p>the influential Ad-Dustour showed President Bush in military </p><p>garb marching to war while tossing "The Palestinian </p><p>tranquilizer" pill over his shoulder into the mouth of an </p><p>ecstatic Arab.  Prominent columnist Tariq Masarweh predicts </p><p>in the semi-official daily al-Rai that the announcement </p><p>"would do nothing to assuage popular anger or U.S. double </p><p>standards, and the promised Palestinian state, should it ever </p><p>materialize despite \'impossible preconditions,\' would lack </p><p>borders, people, a capital and contiguous territory." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The government-affiliated English-language Jordan </p><p>Times took a somewhat more positive tone and characterized </p><p>the President\'s statement as "long overdue, but nonetheless </p><p>welcomed."  It went on to note, however, that if the </p><p>President "is serious about solving the conflict, he should </p><p>be evenhanded.  Before asking the Palestinians for a prime </p><p>minister with \'real authority,\' he should ask Israel for a </p><p>real commitment to peace."  Longtime establishment columnist </p><p>Musa Keilani summed up the general skepticism by noting "If </p><p>we are misreading the situation, then let Washington correct </p><p>it right now by setting a deadline for Israel to publicly </p><p>undertake to abide by UN Security Council resolutions and </p><p>then implement that undertaking.  Anything short of that </p><p>would be meaningless and sheer deception." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The King has long expressed the concern that </p><p>simultaneous conflicts in Iraq and the West Bank could create </p><p>significant problems for Jordan.  The GOJ has been pressing </p><p>for public release and presidential endorsement of the </p><p>Roadmap, and will be pleased by the President\'s remarks. </p><p>Nonetheless, most Jordanians will view this move as a way to </p><p>distract world attention from Iraq, and will be convinced of </p><p>our sincerity only when they see concrete progress toward a </p><p>Palestinian state. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
