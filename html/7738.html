<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002809 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON ARAFAT CONTACTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 106646 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In absence of higher-ranking MFA officials, we </p><p>delivered reftel demarche to Acting Head of Department for </p><p>Middle East and Maghreb Tuzun.  In response Tuzun said he is </p><p>not aware of any current GOT plans to visit Arafat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Noting Turkey\'s strong support for President Bush,s </p><p>initiative, Tuzun underscored Turkey\'s good relations with </p><p>both Palestinians and Israelis and readiness to contribute to </p><p>a solution.  After citing a Turkish-translation of a </p><p>&Ha,aretz8 article quoting Japanese Foreign Minister </p><p>Yoriko Kawaguchi saying she will meet Arafat despite Israeli </p><p>objections, Tuzun then shared his personal view regarding </p><p>Turkish relations with the Palestinians and Israelis.  He </p><p>stated that, since Arafat is the legally elected Palestinian </p><p>chairman, it would not be proper not to visit him and it </p><p>would be more useful to have direct talks with Arafat to </p><p>express Turkish views.  It would not be useful to put </p><p>restrictions on dealing with the Palestinians at the </p><p>beginning of the peace process.  Tuzun re-emphasized these </p><p>views are his own.  We asked him to ensure U.S. views were </p><p>considered at more senior levels. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
