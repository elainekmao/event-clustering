<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001643 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/TB, INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, MARR, BM </p><p>SUBJECT:  BURMA\'S ARMED FORCES PAT THEMSELVES ON THE </p><p>-         BACK AND PROMOTE THE ARMY CINC </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DESPITE UNUSUALLY INCLEMENT WEATHER, THE </p><p>49TH BURMQY WENT OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT ON MARCH 27.  IN </p><p>HIS HOLIDAY ADDRESS, SLORC CHAIRMAN THAN SHWE STRESSED </p><p>THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE MILITARY IN BURMESE NATION- </p><p>BUILDING AND CALLED FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>STABILITY.  WITHOUT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT ARMY CINC LTG </p><p>MAUNG AYE WAS AWARDED HIS FOURTH STAR ON MARCH 21, THUS </p><p>FIRMING UP HIS FORMAL SUPERIOR RANKING TO POWERFUL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CZAR LTG KHIN NYUNT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>DON\'T RAIN ON MY PARADE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE MOST REMARKABLE ASPECT OF THE RITUAL MASS </p><p>MARCH AND SPEECH BY THE DEFENSE SERVICES COMMANDER AND </p><p>SLORC CHIEF, SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE, WAS THE </p><p>UNSEASONAL SQUALL (THE FIRST IN 118 YEARS OF </p><p>RECORD-KEEPING) THAT COINCIDED WITH THE EVENTS. </p><p>SHOWING THEIR METTLE, NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE SLORC </p><p>FLINCHED FOR AN UMBRELLA; NEWSPAPER PHOTOS SHOW THE </p><p>WHOLE SLORC LINEUP, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAN SHWE, </p><p>SOAKED TO THE SKIN.  NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF SUPERSTITION HERE, THE FREAK WEATHER </p><p>PROVED TO BE GRIST FOR THE MILLS OF THE MANY BURMESE </p><p>LOOKING HERE FOR OMENS OF THE SLORC\'S IMPENDING DEMISE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A SHORT AND MINIMALLY POLEMICAL SPEECH, SENIOR </p><p>GENERAL THAN SHWE CHARACTERIZED THE MILITARY\'S MAIN </p><p>TASK NOW AS CREATING CONDITIONS TO ENSURE POLITICAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC STABILITY EVEN AFTER POWER IS TRANSFERRED </p><p>TO A NOMINALLY CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT (NO TIMEFRAME </p><p>SPECIFIED).  HE LAID SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION BUT SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ONLY OF THE NEED </p><p>FOR A MEETING OF THE MINDS WITH ARMED INSURGENTS, NOT </p><p>THE SLORC\'S POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  HE ALSO POINTED TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THE NEW CONSTITUTION AS </p><p>SERIOUS FACTORS IN BURMA\'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, THOUGH THAN SHWE HIMSELF CLAIMED "THE </p><p>NATION IS STRONG ONLY WHEN THE TATMADAW (ARMY) IS </p><p>STRONG," THE GOVERNMENT RADIO COMMENTATOR REMINDED </p><p>LISTENERS THAT THE MILITARY EXISTS FOR THE COUNTRY, </p><p>NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.  NOTE:  WHETHER COINCIDENTAL </p><p>OR NOT, THIS PHRASE WAS FREQUENTLY USED BY AUNG SAN </p><p>SUU KYI DURING HER PRO-DEMOCRACY CAMPAIGNING. </p><p> </p><p>5. (ORIGINAL TEXT MISSIN) ...WESTERN AMBASSADORS </p><p>EITHER HAVING DISCREETLY LEFT TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND OR </p><p>SIMPLY DECLINING OUTRIGHT THEIR INVITATION TO THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES DAY BANQUET, THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR FOUND </p><p>HIMSELF THE TEMPORARY DEAN OF THE LOCAL DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CORPS.  BESIDES OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES, RUSSIA, </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA AND ISRAEL ALL SENT DIPLOMATS TO THE </p><p>DINNER, WHICH REPORTEDLY WAS OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>ERADICATING HISTORY WITH A HISTORY MUSEUM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  REGARDING OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ARMED FORCES DAY </p><p>CELEBRATION, SEVERAL CONSPICUOUS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS </p><p>WERE SUCCESSFULLY RUSHED TO COMPLETION IN TIME FOR THE </p><p>HOLIDAY.  THESE INCLUDED A DAM NEAR PROME, A </p><p>MILITARY-SPONSORED BUDDHIST MONASTERY NEAR THE </p><p>SHWEDAGON PAGODA, AND THE DEFENSE SERVICES MUSEUM. </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF THE MASSIVE NEW MUSEUM ENTAILED THE </p><p>DEMOLITION OF THE COLONIAL-ERA JUBILEE HALL, THE SITE </p><p>OF MANY IMPORTANT EVENTS IN BURMA\'S POST-INDEPENDENCE </p><p>HISTORY (INCLUDING AUNG SAN\'S STATE FUNERAL).  THE </p><p>MUSEUM\'S INITIAL EXHIBITION FOCUSES ON BURMESE </p><p>MILITARY HISTORY (LESS HISTRIONIC THAN EXPECTED) AND </p><p>THE WORK OF THE REGIONAL COMMANDS.  INDICATIVE OF THE </p><p>SEAMLESSNESS OF THE MILITARY/GOVERNMENT WEB HERE, EACH </p><p>MINISTRY, WHETHER OR NOT HEADED BY A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>ARMED FORCESQY DEVOTED TO ITSACTIVITIES. PUBLIC </p><p>ATTENDANCE HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN DISAPPOINTING. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A QUIET PROMOTION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  TO DATE THE SLORC HAS NOT USED THE ARMED FORCES </p><p>CELEBRATION TO ANNOUNCE PROMOTIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, </p><p>WITHOUT FANFARE, THE ARMY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LTG </p><p>MAUNG AYE, WAS AWARDED HIS FOURTH STAR ON MARCH 21. </p><p>SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN LISTED SIMPLY AS "GENERAL," </p><p>INCLUDING IN THE PORTRAIT PANTHEON MOUNTED IN THE </p><p>ENTRANCE OF THE JUST OPENED DEFENSE SERVICES MUSEUM. </p><p>GOB CONTACTS VIEW HIS PROMOTION AS SIMPLY ROUTINE, </p><p>COMING AFTER THE TRADITIONAL YEAR\'S WAIT IN THE FOUR </p><p>STAR ARMY CINC BILLET.  ALL THE SAME, MAUNG AYE NOW </p><p>FORMALLY OUTRANKS KHIN NYUNT AND IS EVEN MORE THAN </p><p>BEFORE THE OBVIOUS CHOICE TO SUCCEED THAN SHWE, SHOULD </p><p>THE SLORC CHIEF CEDE THE REINS ANYTIME SOON. </p><p> </p><p>HUDDLE </p><p></p></div>
