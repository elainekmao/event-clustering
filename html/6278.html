<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001546 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW TURKISH GOVERNMENT: WHAT WILL ERDOGAN\'S </p><p>CABINET LOOK LIKE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1364 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: AK Party chairman Erdogan has the mandate to </p><p>form a new Turkish government.  We expect him to shuffle the </p><p>outgoing cabinet, although timing of the shuffle is not yet </p><p>certain.  While the Erdogan government might assume office </p><p>quickly, contacts across the spectrum advise us Erdogan is </p><p>not in a hurry to re-submit a U.S. deployment resolution to </p><p>parliament.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AK Party chairman Tayyip Erdogan has taken the oath as </p><p>an M.P., current P.M. Abdullah Gul has submitted his </p><p>resignation, and President Sezer has given Erdogan the </p><p>mandate to form a new government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) We expect Erdogan to submit his cabinet list to Sezer </p><p>quickly, perhaps as early as March 12.  Reftel gives the </p><p>sequence and timing of steps for the new government to assume </p><p>power, present its program, and then be confirmed in a vote </p><p>of confidence.  In any event the Erdogan government will take </p><p>office from the moment Sezer approves a cabinet list and </p><p>sends it to parliament, which could be as early as March 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Korkut Ozal, a brother of late P.M./President Turgut </p><p>Ozal and a Godfather to the reformist wing of the National </p><p>View (Milli Gorus) Islamist movement ("the Movement") which </p><p>Erdogan grew up in, told us March 11 he has urged Erdogan to </p><p>focus first on passing a U.S. deployment resolution and only </p><p>then shuffle the cabinet.  Otherwise, Ozal thinks, the </p><p>resentments provoked by changes in the cabinet will further </p><p>distract Erdogan and compound the fate of any new draft </p><p>resolution.  Ozal acknowledged, however, that Erdogan\'s </p><p>temper may get the better of him and lead him to shuffle the </p><p>cabinet at the beginning of his tenure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Faruk Demir -- the executive director of the Advanced </p><p>Strategy Center (YSM), which has close links to the TGS, NSC, </p><p>and National Intelligence Organization -- told us March 10 </p><p>that he has heard Erdogan\'s cabinet shuffle may affect a </p><p>sizeable slice of the cabinet.  Demir\'s analysis of why </p><p>Erdogan may replace some or all of the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Deputy P.M. Ertugrul Yalcinbayir (known as a "liberalist"; </p><p>he reportedly voted against the draft resolution to permit </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops because he already knew he would </p><p>not be included in the Erdogan cabinet); </p><p>--Deputy P.M. Mehmet Ali Sahin (seen by Erdogan\'s circle as </p><p>too close to Gul); </p><p>--State Minister in charge of finance Ali Babacan (nervous, </p><p>pushy, and lacking the sense of deference Erdogan demands); </p><p>--State Minister in charge of foreign trade Kursad Tuzmen </p><p>(not deferential enough); </p><p>--State Minister in charge of religious affairs Mehmet Aydin </p><p>(reportedly close to Islamist philosopher Fethullah Gulen, </p><p>and thus not considered inside the National View Islamist </p><p>circle among Erdogan\'s close advisors; </p><p>--Fonmin Yasar Yakis (Erdogan had not wanted Yakis as Fonmin </p><p>in the Gul government, but was forced to put him in the </p><p>position in a rearrangement resulting from Sezer\'s rejection </p><p>of another cabinet designate; in any event, Yakis has been a </p><p>hack-handed embarrassment to Erdogan); </p><p>--Culture Minister Huseyin Celik (similarly to Yalcinbayir, </p><p>voted against the deployment resolution because he had heard </p><p>he would not be in Erdogan\'s cabinet; in any event </p><p>controversial as minister); </p><p>--Tourism Minister Aksit (ineffective); </p><p>--Education Minister Erkan Mumcu (not from the Movement and </p><p>too openly ambitious for Erdogan\'s taste; might be shifted to </p><p>a lower-profile ministry). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Demir said his sources tell him that, as part of a </p><p>move to reduce the number of ministries, Erdogan may combine </p><p>the Babacan and Tuzmen portfolios under a single </p><p>finance/foreign trade state ministership; figures rumored to </p><p>be under consideration are AK Party deputy chairman for </p><p>research and development Reha Denemec (excellent English; MBA </p><p>from the U.S.) or Nazim Ekrem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In addition a visibly nervous Justice Minister Cemil </p><p>Cicek, one of the most experienced members of Gul\'s cabinet </p><p>but not a member of the Movement, told us March 11 he is not </p><p>certain he will be kept on, a reflection of how close to the </p><p>chest Erdogan is keeping his choices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Mehmet Ali Bayar, a former Turkish diplomat with wide </p><p>political contacts and now senior foreign policy advisor to </p><p>right-of-center DYP chairman Agar, warned us March 11 that </p><p>Erdogan will stall submission of a new draft deployment </p><p>resolution as long as possible.  Bayar opines that Erdogan </p><p>and his advisors are wrapped up in narrowly-focused </p><p>calculations of how to ensure personal position and power. </p><p>In making a similar assessment to us March 10, YSM executive </p><p>director Demir stated that Erdogan is scared for his </p><p>political future and therefore paralyzed in his </p><p>decision-making on the deployment question. </p><p>9. (C) Founding member of Ozal\'s ANAP and former close Ozal </p><p>advisor Vehbi Dincerler affirmed to us as well March 11 that </p><p>Erdogan will not tangle with the resolution unless the U.S. </p><p>gives him something he can portray to the Turkish public as </p><p>an additional U.S. commitment, e.g., a concrete clarification </p><p>of Turkey\'s role in post-Saddam Iraq, a U.S. commitment on </p><p>the role of the Turkmen in N. Iraq, a stronger U.S. </p><p>commitment to prevent formation of an independent Kurdish </p><p>state.  In discussing timing, Korkut Ozal told us that the </p><p>lack of an absolute drop-dead date from the U.S. for the </p><p>beginning of hostilities is also making it hard for Erdogan </p><p>to feel a sense of urgency. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
