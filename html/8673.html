(U) In an abbreviated Board session (one day), the </p><p>Executive Board approved a country program for Pakistan, a </p><p>school feeding intervention for Lesotho, and protracted </p><p>relief and recovery operations for Kenya (Somali and </p><p>Sudanese refugees), Uganda (refugees and internally </p><p>displaced), and the Central African Republic. USDEL </p><p>conducted a number of productive side meetings dealing with </p><p>WFP\'s relationships with NGOs, UNHCR, and updates on WFP </p><p>interventions on Pakistan, Uganda and parts of the Great </p><p>Lakes region of Central Africa. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Pakistan Country Program and Lesotho school feeding </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Board approved the 2004-2008 Pakistan country </p><p>program with a five-year funding approval amounting to USD </p><p>77.9 million. USDEL lauded WFP\'s efforts to "focus and </p><p>concentrate" its proposed efforts in 34 districts. Other </p><p>USDEL comments were as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-Stronger capacity for monitoring poverty and the impact of </p><p>anti-poverty programs needs to be developed; </p><p> </p><p>-WFP and its UN sister Agencies are encouraged to work </p><p>closely with host government partners related to the </p><p>honoring of stated commitments to protect women and </p><p>minorities against legal, political and social </p><p>discrimination; </p><p> </p><p>-USDEL strongly agrees with WFP\'s focus and attention to </p><p>"promoting safe motherhood" in conjunction with WFP-assisted </p><p>health programs, especially the emphasis on factors that </p><p>affect low birth weight, timing of first births, inter-birth </p><p>intervals, and maternal nutrition; </p><p> </p><p>-WFP is encouraged to expand its relationship with NGOs that </p><p>need to be increasingly recognized as a useful and </p><p>potentially significant part of Pakistan\'s development; </p><p> </p><p>-We are particularly concerned with beneficiaries, such as </p><p>Afghan refugees, and ask that WFP focus on pipeline issues. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In a side meeting with WFP Country Director German </p><p>Valdivia, implementation of the WFP-UNHCR MOU (whereby WFP </p><p>assumes responsibility for food deliveries directly to the </p><p>refugee populations) was discussed as well as the problems </p><p>resulting from a poorly resourced food pipeline. Valdivia </p><p>indicated that WFP was dropping 27,500 refugees from the </p><p>program as the tripartite process had decided (GOP, UNHCR </p><p>and WFP) to close one camp and repatriate the refugees. </p><p>(Comment: it was not clear whether this action in cutting </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>off distribution may be de facto coercing the refugees to </p><p>return to Afghanistan.  Refcoord and PRM/ANE may wish to </p><p>follow up with UNHCR. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On Lesotho, the Board approved a four year (2004- </p><p>2007) school feeding support to the GOL\'s Free Primary </p><p>Education undertaking, with a total cost to WFP of USD 14.45 </p><p>million. The project will assist 285,300 beneficiaries. </p><p>USDEL noted that Lesotho remains dramatically food insecure </p><p>and that the "drag" of AIDs on economic growth will further </p><p>reduce the ability of the government to handle the rising </p><p>social and healthcare costs. USDEL suggested that where </p><p>appropriate WFP and its sister UN Agencies should consider </p><p>revisiting previous methods of shoring up governments and </p><p>populations in crisis -- including direct support to </p><p>ministries, organizations and institutions that are losing </p><p>the human resources and skilled professionals required to </p><p>function effectively. Note: U.S. Ambassador in Maseru was </p><p>reportedly thanked profusely by GOL officials for U.S. </p><p>support of school feeding in Lesotho. End note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Protracted relief and recovery (PRRO) operation - Kenya </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) WFP\'S protracted relief and recovery operation </p><p>(PRRO) for Kenya (10258.0) - Food assistance to Somali and </p><p>Sudanese refugees, from October 2003 through September 2005, </p><p>covering 230,358 beneficiaries, with a total cost to WFP of </p><p>USD 57.46 million - was approved by the Board. WFP Country </p><p>Director Tesema Negash commented that at present "about 15 </p><p>percent of the food delivered to the camps is sold or </p><p>bartered due to the inability of the other UN Agencies to </p><p>supply non-food items." He also estimated that some 6 </p><p>percent of the refugees were presently engaged in income </p><p>generating activities but this was exceedingly difficult to </p><p>document. Negash concluded that at present the camps were </p><p>reasonably secure, given that the UN had supplied patrol </p><p>vehicles to the local police. Germany stated that it was </p><p>willing to consider placing experts into Kenya\'s "line </p><p>ministries" to strengthen implementation efforts. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Protracted relief and recovery (PRRO) operation - Budget </p><p>increase Uganda </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) A budget increase for PRRO Uganda 10121.0 - Targeted </p><p>Food Assistance for Relief and Recovery of Refugees, </p><p>Displaced Persons and Vulnerable Groups in Uganda, from </p><p>April 2002 through March 2005, with a revised total cost to </p><p>WFP of USD 178.9 million and an additional beneficiary </p><p>caseload is 567,276, which brings the overall caseload to </p><p>1,596,691 persons - was approved by the Board. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In a USDEL side meeting, Uganda Country Director </p><p>Ken Davies gave an overview of WFP operations for 154,000 </p><p>refugees, over 800,000 IDPs, and now an additional 535,000 </p><p>drought victims and 6,000 especially vulnerable new </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Congolese refugees (out of 30,000 recent new arrivals).  Of </p><p>the 6,000 vulnerable new arrivals, most of them are women </p><p>and children, and about half are expected to accept UNHCR\'s </p><p>offer to relocate to a refugee camp.  A contribution from </p><p>the European Commission is expected to prevent a break in </p><p>the PRRO pipeline before September.  Furthermore, USAID/FFP </p><p>plans to contribute to the PRRO through an approved call- </p><p>forward this month. </p><p>8. (SBU) Davies said that resourcing a PRRO with such a </p><p>diverse caseload has been especially difficult over the last </p><p>year.  Many donors diverted contributions to southern Africa </p><p>and other crises while attacks by the Lord\'s Resistance Army </p><p>(LRA) and instability in the north exacerbated needs for </p><p>IDPs in particular and resulted in increased acute </p><p>malnutrition among IDP children under five years old. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) As for the refugees, Davies felt that despite some </p><p>difficulties, the Self Reliance Strategy (SRS) had been </p><p>successful in many respects and enabled WFP to remove 40,000 </p><p>refugees from its caseload, as they received land and became </p><p>self-sufficient.  He added that the best land had already </p><p>been distributed, and other refugees included in the SRS </p><p>would need to rely on WFP to meet 10-40 percent of their </p><p>food needs.  As the largest buyer of food in Uganda, WFP has </p><p>had a positive impact on small-scale agricultural </p><p>production.  In effect, it has supported small farmer </p><p>cooperatives and greatly strengthened Uganda\'s commercial </p><p>agricultural sector.  WFP purchased USD 9 million of cereals </p><p>and pulses locally in 2002 and plans to purchase USD 20 </p><p>million this year. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Regarding efforts to prevent exploitation, Davies </p><p>described how WFP distributes food to clusters of </p><p>households, many of which are headed by women, and relies </p><p>upon traditional leaders within each cluster for the </p><p>allocation to individual households.  In refugee camps, WFP </p><p>plans to move towards family-based distributions.  Security </p><p>conditions preclude advance announcement of distributions. </p><p>WFP-UNHCR-NGO-GOU joint assessment missions are conducted in </p><p>66 settlements every six months. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Davies was especially appreciative of PRM\'s recent </p><p>cash contribution towards refugee needs in Uganda.  He said </p><p>that the refugees were an easy caseload for WFP to target </p><p>there.  Asked how the local purchase process worked and the </p><p>timelines involved, he said that upon learning of a PRM </p><p>contribution, he could immediately issue a tender and then </p><p>sign a contract within two weeks.  The contract would </p><p>require delivery within four weeks, and the refugees would </p><p>actually receive the food another two weeks after that. </p><p>Therefore, the food will be distributed to the refugees no </p><p>later than two months after the contribution is made. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Other USDEL side meetings - NGOs/UNHCR MOU/ICRC-related </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) USDEL met WFP Deputy Executive Director Shiela </p><p> </p><p>Sisulu and Deputy Director of Operations Francesco Strippoli </p><p>regarding WFP\'s nascent task force to improve its relations </p><p>with the NGO community.  Sisulu commented that after WFP </p><p>Executive Director Morris met in April with NGOs in Kansas </p><p>City, he said he wanted to come out of WFP\'s October 2003 </p><p>conference for NGOs "with his head still on."  Sisulu comes </p><p>from the NGO community, and she is making this initiative </p><p>one of her immediate and top priorities.  She acknowledged </p><p>that WFP and NGOs view each other not only as partners but </p><p>also as competitiors, and she asked for USDEL views. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) FFP Director Lauren Landis suggested that WFP </p><p>focus not only on technical issues but also partnership </p><p>issues with NGOs.  WFP and the NGO community could work on a </p><p>joint framework and ensure its implementation in the field. </p><p>Strippoli agreed, admitting that country offices have little </p><p>clear guidance from WFP Headquarters and considerable </p><p>discretion in how they deal with NGO partners.  As part of </p><p>his efforts to rationalize WFP\'s guidance and instructions </p><p>to the field, he has invited NGOs to a meeting in Rome on </p><p>June 20 to further discuss WFP\'s draft strategic plan and </p><p>report out on progress of the WFP-NGO working group. </p><p>Special focus will be put on a revised risk management plan. </p><p>For example, in some cases, NGO partners are reimbursed for </p><p>warehouse costs on the basis of tonnage delivered, though </p><p>deliveries may be disrupted for reasons beyond their </p><p>control.  Also, WFP\'s contracts with NGO partners are </p><p>usually short-term - 3-6 months - due to the vulnerability </p><p>of pipelines, but Strippoli would like to extend contracts </p><p>through the period of the PRRO or EMOP, subject to </p><p>availability of funding. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) USDEL/PRM commented that this would go part-way to </p><p>addressing NGO concerns around implementation of the WFP- </p><p>UNHCR MOU, but that WFP also needed to consider coordination </p><p>at the field/camp level, especially since some of UNHCR\'s </p><p>NGO partners provide other services to beneficiaries, aside </p><p>from food distribution. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) While Sisulu and Strippoli are leading WFP\'s </p><p>initiative to improve relations with NGOs, Morris has </p><p>specifically indicated his desire to establish an NGO unit </p><p>headed by a senior level coordinator by October 2003. </p><p>Sisulu added that NGOs are also valuable partners in </p><p>building local capacity in recipient countries. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) On WFP\'s relationships with UNHCR, USDEL met with </p><p>Francesco Strippoli, his Interagency Branch Chief Zlatan </p><p>Milisic, West Africa Regional Director Manuel Aranda da </p><p>Silva, Uganda Country Director Ken Davies, and Pakistan </p><p>Country Director German Valdivia.  Each shared their views </p><p>on the pilot programs under the UNHCR-WFP MOU.  Sierra </p><p>Leone, Uganda, and Pakistan represent three of the five </p><p>pilot programs whereby UNHCR has transferred all </p><p>responsibilities for refugee feeding, including end- </p><p>distribution, to WFP.  Zambia is expected to be the fourth </p><p>pilot when the WFP PRRO is renewed and the costs incorporate </p><p>WFP\'s new responsibilities.  WFP has proposed Kenya as the </p><p>fifth pilot to UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Overall, coordination between WFP and UNHCR was </p><p>characterized very positively.  WFP Deputy Executive </p><p>Director and Director for Operations Jean-Jacques Graisse </p><p>and UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner (AHC) Morjane and </p><p>their staffs are in frequent contact on a range of issues. </p><p>Strippoli again requested PRM support for two joint UNHCR- </p><p>WFP field workshops to help ensure that this progress </p><p>translates into training and coordination at the field level </p><p>and that the respective headquarters get feedback from their </p><p>country directors and staff.  Strippoli said that the </p><p>implementation of the MOU, particularly in Sierra Leone, has </p><p>highlighted the need for WFP to re-vamp and improve its </p><p>relations with NGO partners. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) WFP West Africa Regional Manager Aranda da Silva </p><p>noted that there had been some rough spots in the </p><p>implementation of the MOU in Sierra Leone.  The West Africa </p><p>Coastal PRRO did not adequately cover WFP\'s additional costs </p><p>in taking over end-distribution, and WFP and UNHCR have used </p><p>different cost structures and different NGO partners in the </p><p>region.  Both Strippoli and he said that WFP needs to take </p><p>into account the impact of the transfer on camp management; </p><p>some UNHCR implementing partners have had other critical </p><p>responsibilities in the camps, and their presence in some </p><p>cases became economically feasible only by doing food </p><p>distribution.  Furthermore, WFP wants to find a way to ease </p><p>some of the pressure on NGO partners in the region by </p><p>negotiating food distribution contracts for a longer period, </p><p>rather than the standard 90-days.  This </p><p>effort is part of ED Morris\' broader efforts to: (1) improve </p><p>relations with NGOs, (2) shift risk from beneficiaries to </p><p>WFP, and (3) strengthen coordination with other UN </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Implementation of the MOU seemed to go more smoothly </p><p>in Pakistan and especially Uganda.  Uganda Country Director </p><p>Davies noted that WFP and UNHCR had the same four major </p><p>implementing partners.  The existing tripartite agreement </p><p>with the GOU was also useful and provided transparency in </p><p>costs and negotiating new contracts.  WFP has also been able </p><p>to realize some of the savings anticipated by the MOU and </p><p>has negotiated lower rail and trucking costs.  These savings </p><p>have helped WFP offset increased security costs. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Pakistan Country Director Valdivia said that the </p><p>tripartite agreement and good relations with his UNHCR </p><p>counterpart helped make the pilot a success thus far.  He </p><p>said that he had negotiated costs with UNHCR\'s NGO partners </p><p>downwards, as their costs and international staff had been </p><p>inflated post-9/11 and were now more in line with rates of </p><p>other implementing partners. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) On ICRC, Strippoli has begun discussing the </p><p>revision of their 1996 exchange of letters on cooperation, </p><p>making these instruments more operational by replicating a </p><p>number of measures refined in the WFP/UNHCR MOU.  He said </p><p>that WFP and ICRC have cooperated closely and effectively in </p><p>Iraq, Afghanistan, and other emergencies.  The two </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>organizations already consult on dividing up food </p><p>distributions, coverage of different regions and </p><p>beneficiaries, hand-off of operations, and other activities. </p><p>Strippoli wants to work more closely with ICRC on early </p><p>warning, preparedness, and operational issues.  (Note: </p><p>Strippoli asked us to be discreet in discussing this </p><p>initiative, in the event the U.S. wishes to sound out ICRC </p><p>on its views. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) WFP clearly has a lot on its plate. The next six </p><p>months will deeply test its ability to cope with a myriad of </p><p>crises and widespread (ambitious) management improvements. </p><p>"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few." </p><p>Hall </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02657 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
