Ankara stressed that it would not accept </p><p>conditions for an accession date, and added that Turkish </p><p>support for a possible operation against Iraq should not be </p><p>taken for granted.  MFA Spokesman Buluc said Turkey hoped to </p><p>begin accession negotiations with the EU in 2003.  "Radikal" </p><p>claims that Ankara hinted at an EU compromise on the issue </p><p>of the European defense mechanism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: UN Cyprus envoy De Soto said after meeting MFA U/S </p><p>Amb. Ziyal on Thursday that he hoped to see the Cyprus </p><p>problem resolved before the EU Copenhagen Summit in </p><p>December.  De Soto denied reports that Annan would present </p><p>the Turkish and Greek Cypriots a new plan for peace.  The </p><p>MFA praised Annan\'s `good will mission,\' but urged him not </p><p>to interfere in direct talks between the two sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Papandreou in Istanbul: Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou </p><p>met in Istanbul with his Turkish counterpart Gurel to watch </p><p>the soccer game between Istanbul\'s Fenerbahce and Athens\' </p><p>Panathinaikos.  Papandreou told the press that he backed the </p><p>UN attempt to resolve the Cyprus issue, and reiterated </p><p>support for Turkey\'s EU bid.  Accompanied by the </p><p>Panathinaikos soccer team, Papandreou paid a visit to the </p><p>Fener Greek Patriarch Bartholomeos before the game. </p><p>Bartholomeos voiced hope that the new Turkish government </p><p>would contribute to the friendly atmosphere between Greece </p><p>and Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA on Chechens: Dailies claim Ankara was preparing a note </p><p>of protest to Moscow in order to reject allegations </p><p>regarding the presence of Chechen organizations in Turkey. </p><p>MFA Spokesman Buluc said on Thursday that there was no </p><p>`Chechen-Ichkeria organization\' in Turkey.  However, a CNN- </p><p>Turk reporter showed Buluc a business card from a member of </p><p>the organization.  Buluc did not take this seriously, </p><p>pointing out that anybody could print a business card. </p><p>Turkey\'s Ambassador to Moscow Kurtulus Taskent said that any </p><p>outlawed Chechen organization raising money in Turkey would </p><p>be closed, and added that Turkey was ready for cooperation </p><p>with Russia in the fight against terror. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Election: The AKP leadership toned down criticism against </p><p>President Sezer, and recognized that the presidency has the </p><p>ultimate authority to appoint a new Prime Minister.  Papers </p><p>claim that after Erdogan was barred from taking office, a </p><p>heated rivalry has erupted among possible AKP candidates </p><p>Abdullah Gul, Bulent Arinc and Abdullatif Sener for the post </p><p>of Prime Minister.  DSP leader Ecevit accused AKP of hiding </p><p>its true intentions, and said that Turkish secularism might </p><p>be damaged if AKP came to power.  Ecevit told "Milliyet" </p><p>that he would leave DSP leadership within a year.  The </p><p>Constitutional Court is to decide on the injunction against </p><p>Erdogan today.  If the high court upholds the injunction, </p><p>Erdogan will have to step down as AKP chairman.  The High </p><p>Election Board (YSK) said the name of Erdogan appearing on </p><p>election ballot will not lead to an annulment of ballots. </p><p>Papers report State Spokesman Boucher\'s response to a </p><p>question, saying that the U.S. was against the closure of </p><p>political parties for the peaceful expression of their </p><p>views. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Terrorism/Turkey-Russia </p><p>b) Turkey-EU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Russia is right" </p><p>Fatih Altayli commented on the recent tiff between Turkey </p><p>and Russia over Chechen terrorists in the mass appeal </p><p>"Hurriyet" (11/1): "Chechen behavior has served to justify </p><p>the Russian depiction of Chechens as `terrorists.\'  Russia </p><p>is also accusing Turkey of supporting the Chechens.  There </p><p>is no `state policy\' to support Chechens, yet we should </p><p>acknowledge that Turkey has presented a negative picture. . </p><p>If we look at Belgian support for the DHKP-C, for example, </p><p>Belgium can also claim that it does not have a state policy </p><p>to support this terrorist organization.  At the same time, </p><p>Belgium does not interfere when DHKP-C gets organized in the </p><p>country and is involved in illegal acts against Turkey, </p><p>including terrorism. . There is simply no difference between </p><p>what Belgium is doing to Turkey and what Turkey is doing to </p><p>Russia.  The Chechen groups are terrorists for Russia as </p><p>much as the PKK or DHKP-C are terrorists for Turkey.  Russia </p><p>is right to criticize Turkey.  Tolerance and friendly </p><p>feelings do not mean supporting, or even ignoring, </p><p>terrorism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Minds are even more confused!" </p><p>Sami Kohen commented on Turkey\'s EU prospects in the mass </p><p>appeal Milliyet (11/1): "It looks like the upcoming EU </p><p>summit will do its best not to send Turkey home empty- </p><p>handed.  The chances that Turkey will be given a clear and </p><p>firm date for negotiations are nil.  However, we might </p><p>expect `something like a calendar,\' such as a conditional </p><p>negotiation date.  The EU conditions will not be new, but </p><p>rather a series of expectations that Turkey fulfill all of </p><p>its current obligations, particularly in the area of human </p><p>rights and freedoms. . Let\'s hope that the Copenhagen summit </p><p>reaches such a decision.  If that happens, it is quite </p><p>possible that Turkey would begin the negotiations with the </p><p>EU during the Greek chairmanship. . Turkey should not sit </p><p>and wait.  As soon as a decision is given toward Turkey\'s </p><p>negotiation process, we have a lot to accomplish.  I hope by </p><p>that time Turkey has a new government with the EU issue as </p><p>one of its priorities." </p><p></p></div>
