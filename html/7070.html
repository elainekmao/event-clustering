Anandasangaree and N. Raviraj, </p><p>charge the Tigers with using strong-arm tactics in their </p><p>bid to control the Tamil community in Jaffna.  The </p><p>course the two have chosen is a courageous one, but </p><p>risky, and, as of this point, they seem isolated in </p><p>their public stance.  In the long-term, however, their </p><p>decision to oppose the Tigers could have important </p><p>ramifications for politics in the Tamil community.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Two MPs take a Public Stand </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Two key Tamil politicians have ramped up their </p><p>criticism of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>in recent weeks.  In highly unusual public remarks for </p><p>Tamils, the two, V. Anandasangaree and N. Raviraj, have </p><p>publicly underscored that they are independent of the </p><p>LTTE and do not have to listen to the group\'s edicts. </p><p>(Note:  Anandasangaree, 70, is the leader of the Tamil </p><p>United Liberation Front, "TULF," and has been in </p><p>Parliament since 1970.  He is from Jaffna.  Raviraj, 40, </p><p>formerly mayor of Jaffna, represents the </p><p>Chavachchkacheri area in Jaffna for TULF.  He has been </p><p>in Parliament since 2001.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Of the two, Anandasangaree\'s comments have been </p><p>particularly biting.  Last month, for example, he </p><p>announced publicly that he did not see the LTTE as being </p><p>"the sole representative of the Tamil community." </p><p>(Note:  It is a mantra of the LTTE that it is the "sole </p><p>representative" of the Tamils.)  In February, </p><p>Anandasangaree also faced off against the LTTE, publicly </p><p>complaining about the group\'s (successful) effort to </p><p>prevent the ceremonial reopening of the Jaffna library. </p><p>(Note:  In preventing the reopening, the LTTE clearly </p><p>did not want Tamil politicians, such as Anandasangaraee, </p><p>to get the credit for the reconstruction of a cultural </p><p>landmark -- See Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the meantime, Raviraj has also made clear his </p><p>disdain for the LTTE, announcing recently that he was </p><p>seriously considering running as an independent </p><p>candidate for mayor of Jaffna, his former job. </p><p>(Note:  It is possible that long-delayed local elections </p><p>may take place in the north and east in June.)  In </p><p>making this announcement, Raviraj was signaling that he </p><p>wanted out of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a loose </p><p>political grouping of Tamil parties which has forged </p><p>very close links with the Tigers since it was formed in </p><p>late 2001. </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>Strong Views in Private, too </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) To discuss the developing situation, the </p><p>Ambassador met separately with Anandasangaree on </p><p>March 19 and Raviraj on April 1.  In these meetings, </p><p>both men hit out in very, very harsh terms against the </p><p>LTTE.  One core element of their points was the </p><p>(accurate) claim that LTTE cadre are often using </p><p>intimidation and violence against Tamils in Jaffna. </p><p>While providing few details, both men went on to accuse </p><p>the LTTE of assassinating Tamil opponents in Jaffna and </p><p>elsewhere.  (Note:  Per Reftels,  Mission has picked up </p><p>several reports lately in which LTTE cadre allegedly </p><p>have killed informants working for the security forces </p><p>and other Tamils.  These reports have not been </p><p>confirmed.) </p><p>6.  (C) Another aspect of their criticism of the LTTE is </p><p>that the group is showing no respect for the TULF. </p><p>Raviraj remarked that the Tigers seem to believe that </p><p>they have the "complete right" to control Tamil </p><p>politics.  He went on to note to the Ambassador that the </p><p>TULF was the oldest Tamil political party and one of the </p><p>oldest in Sri Lanka, and should be respected by the </p><p>LTTE.  In emotional tones, Raviraj also commented that </p><p>the Tigers should now back off given that the LTTE-GSL </p><p>war was in remission and let politics in the Tamil </p><p>community play out its natural course. </p><p>7.  (C) In his comments to the two politicians, the </p><p>Ambassador underlined that he respected their courageous </p><p>views.  The U.S. had never accepted that the Tigers were </p><p>the "sole representative of the Tamil people," and had </p><p>also always argued that the Tamil community in the north </p><p>and east deserved full democratic rights.  The </p><p>Ambassador commented, however, that the two would be </p><p>wise to proceed carefully and judiciously.  Both men </p><p>took the Ambassador\'s point, adding that they were </p><p>fearful of possible LTTE retribution and had spoken to </p><p>the GSL to request additional security.  As of yet, </p><p>however, they had not been threatened directly by the </p><p>Tigers.  The Ambassador asked both men to contact the </p><p>Mission immediately in case they received any such </p><p>threats.  (Note:  For its part, as is its style, the </p><p>LTTE has not commented publicly on the two men\'s </p><p>criticisms, though some pro-LTTE elements have harshly </p><p>hit out at them.) </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>Isolated, So Far </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) At this point, Anandasangaree and Raviraj seem </p><p>isolated from the mainstream of Tamil politics, and, as </p><p>of yet, there is no indication that other well-known </p><p>Tamil politicians are about to join them in their anti- </p><p>LTTE stand.  (Note:  There are several former </p><p>paramilitary parties that have historically opposed the </p><p>LTTE.  These groups, though they have some support, are </p><p>not within the general mainstream of Tamil politics.) </p><p>When asked, Anandasangaree admitted that few of the </p><p>other TNA (including TULF) MPs supported his views, </p><p>though he felt that some of them might do so privately. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In a sign of the problem the two might have in </p><p>gaining support, N. Sampathan, a TULF MP from </p><p>Trincomalee with historically moderate leanings, has </p><p>given no indication of wanting to join them.  In an </p><p>April 2 meeting with the Ambassador, Sampathan said he </p><p>thought that Anandasangaree was being "too emotional" </p><p>about things and "needed to act his age as a senior </p><p>leader of the party."  Anandasangaree, he added, had </p><p>said some "unfortunate" things about the LTTE over the </p><p>Jaffna library incident.  To clear the air, Sampathan </p><p>recommended that Anandasangaree go to the LTTE- </p><p>controlled Wanni region and discuss his concerns face- </p><p>to-face with the Tiger leadership.  When asked, </p><p>Sampathan discounted the possibility that </p><p>Anandasangaree\'s life might be under threat from the </p><p>LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Sampathan also maintained a sunny perspective </p><p>regarding the LTTE, in general.  He said he thought the </p><p>group\'s cadre were reacting well to peace and that they </p><p>were maturing "after years in the jungle."  It would </p><p>take time until the group acted more as a political </p><p>party and less as an insurgent army, but the </p><p>transformation had already begun.  Queried about reports </p><p>of intimidation, Sampathan remarked that the Tigers </p><p>could not be blamed fully for that, as they were </p><p>fighting off the former paramilitary groups, which had </p><p>used strong-arm tactics against other Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The course Anandasangaree and Raviraj have </p><p>chosen is a courageous one.  It is also highly risky for </p><p>the two given that several top leaders of TULF have been </p><p>killed by the LTTE in the past.  These assassinations </p><p>include that of TULF leader A. Amirthalingham (killed in </p><p>July 1989) and TULF senior MP N. Thirulchelvam (killed </p><p>July 1999).  It is possible that the ongoing peace </p><p>process might afford the two men some protection in that </p><p>the Tigers might be reluctant to kill high-profile Tamil </p><p>opponents at this time. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) In the long-term, the decision by the two to </p><p>oppose the Tigers could have important ramifications, </p><p>especially if the ceasefire and peace process continue. </p><p>In the past, when the war was on, many Tamils did not </p><p>want to break community solidarity and criticize the </p><p>group.  In light of the current peaceful situation, </p><p>however, many Tamils are clearly feeling less beholden. </p><p>Although very few Tamils have taken the plunge thus far, </p><p>it is possible that Anandasangaree and Raviraj could be </p><p>at the forefront of a movement that could point Tamil </p><p>politics in a more constructive direction.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
