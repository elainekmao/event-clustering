(U) Local press reported on March 3 that the General </p><p>Manager of the Stock and Commodity Authority -- the UAE </p><p>equivalent of the SEC -- Abdullah Al Turifi, told UAE </p><p>financial institutions that he expects the possible war with </p><p>Iraq to have long-term impact on UAE stock markets. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Stock and Commodity Authority will reduce </p><p>expected market volatility by putting stronger curbs in </p><p>place to prevent equity values from dropping too </p><p>precipitously.  (Note:  Current curbs are 10% movement per </p><p>day.  End note.)  Al Turifi also conceded that the market is </p><p>currently moribund as traders have postponed purchases until </p><p>after the war starts, since they expect stock prices to </p><p>tumble once it begins. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment:  While some in the UAE anticipate business </p><p>opportunities as a result of the Iraq crisis, the local </p><p>stock market regulatory authority is clearly taking no </p><p>chances, acting now to prevent potential market </p><p>destabilization in the event of a conflict. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
