<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT FOR REAP AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, VM, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM:  2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SECTSTATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>1.  EMBASSY\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL FOLLOWS IN PARAGRAPH 2. </p><p>THE RESPONSE IS KEYED TO THE PARAGRAPHS IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2. </p><p>A)  THE GVN HAS ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE GLOBAL COALITION </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM AND TAKEN A NUMBER OF MEASURES AGAINST AL- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02692  01 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>QAIDA.  THE GVN HAS CLEARLY AND FREQUENTLY DENOUNCED </p><p>TERRORISM DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.  THE GVN </p><p>RATIFIED FOUR ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS RELATED </p><p>TO COUNTERTERRORISM, BRINGING ITS TOTAL TO EIGHT.  THE GVN </p><p>SUPPORTED THE ADOPTION OF THE US-ASEAN COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>DECLARATION.  AT THE UN, THE GVN DESCRIBED TERRORISM AS "A </p><p>GLOBAL SCOURGE," ADDING THAT "ANY COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURE </p><p>MUST COMPLY WITH THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, RESPECT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OF STATES."  THE GVN HAS CONTINUED TO AGREE TO </p><p>RECEIVE FROM THE U.S. LISTS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, TO REVIEW ITS IMMIGRATION RECORDS, TO ADD </p><p>THESE NAMES TO ITS WATCHLISTS, AND TO ORDER SEARCHES OF THE </p><p>RECORDS OF ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR ASSETS RELATED TO </p><p>AL-QAIDA AND OTHER TERRORIST ENTITIES.  DURING 2002, THE GVN </p><p>FURTHER UPGRADED SECURITY FROM ALREADY ELEVATED POST- </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 LEVELS AT MANY DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS IN </p><p>HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE U.S., TO </p><p>DETER TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>B)  DURING 2002 THERE WERE NO KNOWN ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM OR PROSECUTIONS FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM IN VIETNAM. </p><p>THERE WERE NO KNOWN JUDICIAL ACTIONS IN VIETNAM DURING 2002 </p><p>RELATED TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE GVN </p><p>CONTINUED THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO PRESS FOR THE </p><p>PROSECUTION OF INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING "TERRORIST" </p><p>ACTS IN 2001 AGAINST VIETNAMESE INTERESTS OVERSEAS.  IN </p><p>OCTOBER 2002, A US COURT CONVICTED ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS </p><p>OF ATTEMPTED ARSON AND ASSAULT ON A FEDERAL OFFICER DURING </p><p>AN ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG </p><p>IN SAN FRANCISCO IN DECEMBER 2001.  THE GVN HAS DESCRIBED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02692  01 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>THIS ATTEMPTED ATTACK INCIDENT AS "TERRORISM."  US </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARRESTED A US RESIDENT ON TERRORISM-RELATED </p><p>CHARGES IN OCTOBER 2001 AND HELD HIM PENDING AN EXTRADITION </p><p>HEARING IN NOVEMBER 2002 TO STAND TRIAL IN THAILAND FOR AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO BOMB THE VIETNAMESE EMBASSY IN BANGKOK. </p><p> </p><p>C)  EXTRADITION:  THE GVN DID NOT EXTRADITE ANY SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS DURING THE YEAR, NOR WERE ANY REQUESTS FOR SUCH </p><p>EXTRADITIONS MADE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE.  THE GVN HAS CONTINUED </p><p>TO PRESS FOR THE EXTRADITION TO THAILAND OF TWO INDIVIDUALS </p><p>RESIDING IN THE U.S. THAT THE GVN ASSERTS WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO BOMB GVN INTERESTS OVERSEAS.  US AUTHORITIES </p><p>ARRESTED ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN 2001 (SEE PARA B); US </p><p>EXTRADITION HEARINGS ARE PROCEEDING. </p><p> </p><p>D)  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY </p><p>BETWEEN THE GVN AND THE USG.  HOWEVER, AT USG REQUEST, THE </p><p>GVN HAS DEPORTED INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED OF CRIMES TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>E)  THE GVN MADE NUMEROUS PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING </p><p>TERRORISM;  SOME EXAMPLES FOLLOW.  IN JANUARY, COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH, DURING AN INTERVIEW </p><p>WITH A WESTERN JOURNALIST, SAID THAT "WE OPPOSE TERRORISM IN </p><p>ANY FORM."  ON APRIL 28, DURING THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT </p><p>MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN PHU </p><p>BINH STATED THAT "VIETNAM CONDEMNS ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM." </p><p>ON MAY 10, THE MFA SPOKESPERSON "STRONGLY CONDEMNED" THE MAY </p><p>9 BOMBINGS IN DAGESTAN.  ON OCTOBER 14, AFTER THE BALI </p><p>BOMBINGS, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESPERSON </p><p>STATED THAT "VIETNAM RESOLUTELY CONDEMNS AND ACTS AGAINST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02692  01 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>TERRORISM IN WHATEVER FORMS. . . . IT IS WORTHY TO NOTE THAT </p><p>THE BLAST TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE WORLD COMMUNITY IS </p><p>EXERTING CONCERTED EFFORTS TO PREVENT TERRORIST MOVES."  SHE </p><p>ADDED THAT "THE BOMB BLAST IS AN INTOLERABLE CRIME."  THE </p><p>GVN SUPPORTED MISSION-SPONSORED SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL </p><p>EVENTS.  PROVINCIAL-LEVEL GVN AUTHORITIES SEIZED PRODUCTS </p><p>BEARING USAMA BIN-LADEN\'S IMAGE ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT PRODUCTION OF SUCH ITEMS WAS PUNISHABLE BY </p><p>LAW. </p><p> </p><p>F)  THE GVN, REPRESENTED BY PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, </p><p>SUPPORTED THE ADOPTION OF THE US-ASEAN COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>DECLARATION AT THE ASEAN SUMMIT IN BRUNEI DURING JULY.  HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY POLICE ESTABLISHED A "TACTICAL RESPONSE TEAM" </p><p>THAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A COUNTERTERRORISM TOOL, ALTHOUGH ITS </p><p>MORE IMMEDIATE USE WAS PROBABLY AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME </p><p>GANGS.  A SIMILAR TACTICAL UNIT NOW EXISTS IN HANOI, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE EMBASSY HAS NOT YET SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OR OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>G)  THE GVN IS NOT KNOWN TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0845 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02692  02 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>ACTION SCT-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  TEST-00  USIE-00  ASDS-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------0429C8  061029Z /38 </p><p>R 061013Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8037 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT FOR REAP AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H)  THE GVN HAS NOT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED A TERRORIST- </p><p>SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM-SPECIFIC ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>I)  THE GVN TOOK A MORE SERIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARDS </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY OF TERRORIST CELLS </p><p>IN FELLOW ASEAN MEMBERS SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA EARLY IN THE </p><p>YEAR.  THE GVN HAS BEEN FOLLOWING CLOSELY THE TRIAL OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG IN SAN FRANCISCO IN DECEMBER 2001. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02692  02 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>THE GVN HAS DEEMED THIS A TERRORIST ACT. </p><p> </p><p>J)  THE GVN HAS COOPERATED WITH THE USG IN A NUMBER OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM AREAS.  THE STATE BANK OF VIETNAM HAS </p><p>ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO ALL STATE, PRIVATE, FOREIGN AND JOINT </p><p>VENTURE BANKS AND BRANCHES TO SEARCH FOR ASSETS RELATED TO </p><p>NAMED ENTITIES ON LISTS PROVIDED BY THE USG, ALTHOUGH IT </p><p>LACKS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR REPORTING RESULTS OF THESE </p><p>SEARCHES.  THE GVN HAS COOPERATED WITH THE US CUSTOMS </p><p>SERVICE\'S OPERATION GREEN QUEST.  THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS HAS AGREED THAT THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY </p><p>(MPS) WOULD CHECK IMMIGRATION RECORDS AGAINST LISTS OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS PROVIDED BY THE USG.  AT USG REQUEST, </p><p>MPS HAS PROVIDED A HIGHLY VISIBLE SECURITY PRESENCE AROUND </p><p>USG FACILITIES.  HOWEVER, IN ONE CASE IN SEPTEMBER, IT TOOK </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS TO PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY SECURITY PRESENCE AT </p><p>ONE FACILITY. </p><p> </p><p>K)  PRIOR TO 2001, THE INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WAS NOT A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HOWEVER, SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, </p><p>THE GVN HAS COOPERATED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WITH THE USG </p><p>EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMITTING </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST US CITIZENS AND INTERESTS.  THE GVN </p><p>HAS AGREED TO CONDUCT CHECKS OF IMMIGRATION RECORDS ON LISTS </p><p>OF NAMES OF TERRORISTS WHO MAY HAVE TRANSITED THROUGH </p><p>VIETNAM.  IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO GENERALLY </p><p>RESPONDED PROMPTLY TO USG REQUESTS FOR CHECKING THE </p><p>BONAFIDES OF PASSPORTS AND VISAS, ESPECIALLY WHEN TIPPED OFF </p><p>THAT THE PASSPORT HOLDERS ARE BEHAVING SUSPICIOUSLY.  THE </p><p>GVN HAS CONTRIBUTED INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT TO US EFFORTS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02692  02 OF 02  061028Z </p><p>IDENTIFY AND SUSPEND FINANCIAL ASSETS OF TERRORISTS AND </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>EXCEPT THE RECEIPT OF SEVERAL SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES -- </p><p>EVENTUALLY CONFIRMED TO BE HARMLESS -- MAILED BOTH </p><p>DOMESTICALLY AND FROM OVERSEAS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM COMMITTED AGAINST US CITIZENS OR INTERESTS IN </p><p>VIETNAM FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS.  THE GVN HAS PROVIDED </p><p>INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE AT USG FACILITIES AND DEVELOPED </p><p>MEASURES TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC THREAT SITUATIONS.  THE GVN </p><p>HAS RESPONDED HELPFULLY AND PROMPTLY TO ANALYZE THE CONTENTS </p><p>OF SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.  HOWEVER, GVN RESPONSE TIMES TO </p><p>OTHER POTENTIALLY THREATENING SITUATIONS HAVE VARIED.  IN </p><p>THE BEST CASE, POLICE RESPONDED WITHIN LESS THAN FIVE </p><p>MINUTES.  IN ANOTHER CASE INVOLVING A DIFFERENT POTENTIAL </p><p>THREAT AT A DIFFERENT FACILITY, CLEARLY THE LOCAL POLICE DID </p><p>NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AT THEIR IMMEDIATE </p><p>DISPOSAL, NOR WERE THEY FAMILIAR WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS </p><p>TYPE OF THREAT.  CALLING IN THE REQUIRED SPECIALISTS TOOK </p><p>THREE HOURS, AND COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS GVN OFFICES </p><p>INVOLVED WAS SLOW.  THE SPECIALISTS THEMSELVES WERE </p><p>PROFESSIONALLY COMPETENT, BUT LACKED ANY PROTECTIVE </p><p>GEAR/EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>L.
