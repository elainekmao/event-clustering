O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, AMGT, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Still Too Few Rains for Non-Irrigated Crops </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  The latest Famine Early Warning Systems </p><p>Network (FEWSNET) report confirms that Zimbabwe is still </p><p>drawing too little rainfall to improve food supply. </p><p>Continued drought affords the GOZ an opportunity to dodge </p><p>blame for the disastrous consequences of its fast-track </p><p>land reform and export policies, the primary causes of </p><p>dwindling agricultural output. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. The FEWSNET report characterizes rainfall during the </p><p>2002/03 as "poor," ranging from 40 to 60 percent of </p><p>normal.  Most other reports from around Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>agricultural centers, both scientific and anecdotal, are </p><p>similarly pessimistic.  Half of this season\'s maize seed </p><p>may not yield crop.  A possibility still exists that </p><p>heavy and persistent rains could rescue much of the crop, </p><p>but it is becoming less likely.  Even under the best of </p><p>climate conditions, Zimbabwe is only cultivating for food </p><p>only 50 percent (and for foreign exchange-earning cash </p><p>crops, only 25 percent) of the area it used in the 1990s. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. Damage caused by the GOZ\'s fast-track land reform and </p><p>export policies far exceeds the repercussions of El Nino. </p><p>However, we expect the GOZ to continue to blame rainfall </p><p>for low agricultural output. Postponing an eventual </p><p>reckoning with its counterproductive policies does not </p><p>bode well for an economy already declining by over 10 </p><p>percent annually.  By the time the GOZ devalues its </p><p>currency, reduces crippling export taxes, stops </p><p>intervening in the sale of primary goods and allows more </p><p>able and equipped farmers take control of the resettled </p><p>lands (perhaps by allowing title deeds to change hands), </p><p>there may not be much of an economy left to salvage. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
