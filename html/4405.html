<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, AORC, PHUM, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: TEMPORARY UNHCR HEAD IN KATHMANDU DISCUSSES </p><p>BHUTANESE REFUGEE SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GENEVA 4707 </p><p>     B. GENEVA 4652 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The new UNHCR Kathmandu Officer-in-Charge </p><p>(OIC) traveled to Nepal,s Bhutanese refugee camps November </p><p>16 to follow-up on an investigation into reports that </p><p>refugees on the staffs of UNHCR,s implementing partner NGOs </p><p>had engaged in sexual exploitation.  The new OIC arrived </p><p>in-country November 13 to take over from the departing </p><p>Representative, who was removed after he was slow to act on </p><p>these reports.  Geneva has tasked the OIC with devising an </p><p>action plan to prevent the recurrence of such incidents and </p><p>to help the victims.  Nepal,s Foreign Ministry has pledged </p><p>to cooperate in the identification and prosecution of the </p><p>perpetrators.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Just Landed, New OIC Leads Mission to Camps </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The newly-arrived Officer-In-Charge for UNHCR </p><p>Kathmandu, Abraham Abraham (Note: same first and last names), </p><p>told the Ambassador November 15 that he would travel to </p><p>southeastern Nepal November 16 to lead an inspection mission </p><p>to follow-up on reports of sexual exploitation by staff at </p><p>the Bhutanese refugee camps (Reftels).  The mission would </p><p>focus on measures and remedies, including protection systems, </p><p>to prevent such problems from recurring, and would look at </p><p>what could be done for those affected, Abraham said.  Abraham </p><p>arrived in Nepal on November 13 on temporary assignment after </p><p>the previous UNHCR Representative, Michel Dupoizat, was </p><p>called back to Geneva "for consultations."  Abraham disclosed </p><p>that Dupoizat probably will not return to his position in </p><p>Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In addition to Abraham himself, the team includes two </p><p>protection officers and a media specialist from UNHCR </p><p>headquarters, as well as two Norwegian experts on sexual </p><p>abuse.  Upon completion of his inspection, Abraham will </p><p>return to Geneva to brief his superiors. </p><p> </p><p>Promises Action Plans, Refocus of Priorities </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In sending Abraham to Nepal, Geneva charged him with </p><p>devising both immediate and long-term plans of action to </p><p>respond to the allegations.  Abraham plans to review UNHCR </p><p>Kathmandu,s entire 2003 program with an eye to reorienting </p><p>it.  From what he knows so far of UNHCR,s operations in </p><p>Nepal, Abraham said, he has noticed a tendency for the </p><p>protection and program teams &to go off on their own without </p><p>sufficient cooperation.8  Thus the protection and </p><p>programming functions would have to be better integrated, he </p><p>judged.  (Note:  Abraham has visited Nepal twice before, and </p><p>previously served as the head of UNHCR,s South Asia desk. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Abraham made clear that his was not a fact-finding </p><p>mission.  A team had already been to the camps for that </p><p>purpose, and their report was in preparation.  He said he </p><p>would await that report before making a judgment on the </p><p>facts, but that as soon as the report is completed, the focus </p><p>will be on identifying the victims.  Eighteen have come </p><p>forward to date.  Abraham confirmed Reftels, reports that </p><p>the perpetrators included teachers and staff of NGOs working </p><p>as UNHCR,s implementing partners, but no one working for </p><p>UNHCR directly. </p><p> </p><p>Donors Briefed on Investigation </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Abraham presided over a donors\' meeting at UNHCR </p><p>Kathmandu\'s offices November 19 at which he briefed on his </p><p>plans for moving forward.  The first priority will for the </p><p>two temporary field officers in Jhapa to contact the victims </p><p>to provide them with psychological, social, medical and </p><p>security assistance.  Second will be to see that immediate </p><p>action is taken against the perpetrators.  Abraham stated </p><p>UNHCR\'s belief that these individuals should be fired, not </p><p>employed elsewhere in the camps, and prosecuted.  Third, </p><p>UNHCR will work with camp and local officials to ensure that </p><p>these types of incidents do not recur.  To this end, they </p><p>plan to:  highlight the problem, train NGOs to deal with it, </p><p>link the issue to "all aspects of assistance," and encourage </p><p>all partners to sign a Code of Conduct similar to that </p><p>devised by UNHCR following a similar scandal in West Africa. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Abraham told the assembled donors that UNHCR had </p><p>delegated "far too much" responsibility to NGOs and to the </p><p>refugees, and it was time for these responsibilities to be </p><p>taken back.  Moreover, the entire protection system would </p><p>have to be reviewed.  Abraham\'s remarks were strikingly </p><p>candid, as when he said, "we thought NGOs knew how to deliver </p><p>humanitarian aid, but perhaps we were mistaken." </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Pledges Cooperation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>8. (C) Abraham related to the Ambassador that he had met with </p><p>Nepal,s ForSec on November 15 and requested that the </p><p>perpetrators be identified and brought to justice.  The </p><p>ForSec was aware of the investigation, and agreed to </p><p>cooperate as far as possible. </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR Taking Charges &Very Seriously8 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) According to Abraham, the reports of sexual </p><p>misbehavior by camp staff &came as a shock to all of us.8 </p><p>The incidents in West Africa had put Geneva &on high </p><p>alert,8 and they did not want to see them repeated. </p><p>Headquarters had an &absolute focus8 to make sure this does </p><p>not go any further and is &nipped in the bud.8  Thus they </p><p>took the reports from Nepal very seriously and would likely </p><p>discipline those involved as well as UNHCR officers who had </p><p>overall responsibility for the program. </p><p> </p><p>Previous Head Out of Step </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) One local UNHCR staff member (strongly protect) told </p><p>Conoff that Dupoizat,s initial reaction to reports of sexual </p><p>abuse had been to rationalize that such incidents are </p><p>inevitable in a refugee population that large.  (Note:  Over </p><p>100,000 Bhutanese refugees inhabit the seven camps.  End </p><p>Note.)  The staffer said she had pointed out to Dupoizat that </p><p>after the West Africa scandal, the High Commissioner had </p><p>stated publicly that even one incident was too many.  Given </p><p>the social stigma, the staffer told Dupoizat that she </p><p>believed the actual number of cases could be at least ten </p><p>times larger than the number reported.  The staffer clarified </p><p>that Dupoizat had not objected when the Jhapa field office, </p><p>in its monthly report to Geneva, had reported the allegations </p><p>of sexual exploitation.  Almost immediately, Geneva sent the </p><p>inspection team described Ref B.  There was no &whistle </p><p>blower8 per se, the staffer added. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) UNHCR headquarters has responded quickly to </p><p>investigate the very serious allegations made against staff </p><p>in its camps.  The problems at UNHCR,s office in Kathmandu </p><p>are not unlike those faced by most large bureaucratic </p><p>organizations:  over-compartmentalization of information, a </p><p>lack of communication and accountability, turf battles.  Even </p><p>so, for a dozen years the office managed what are widely </p><p>regarded as model refugee camps to house the Bhutanese </p><p>refugees.  Dupoizat,s comments to his local staffer suggest </p><p>that his removal came in large part because he was out of </p><p>step with his High Commissioner--and with the times--and thus </p><p>had acted slowly to address serious problems in the camps </p><p>under his charge. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
