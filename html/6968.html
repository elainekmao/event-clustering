<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000572 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOIST IDEOLOGUE SURFACES IN CAPITAL; </p><p>CONDEMNS US INTERFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Since his return to the capital March 28, </p><p>Maoist ideologue and second-ranking leader Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>has conducted a media blitz, appearing at two consecutive </p><p>press conferences, a Reporters\' Club ceremony, and a popular </p><p>television talk show.  In his appearances so far, Bhattarai </p><p>has castigated the Government for alleged  ceasefire </p><p>violations, emphasized that the Maoists have not given up on </p><p>their goal of a republic, pressed the demand for a </p><p>constituent assembly, and criticized the US for "interfering" </p><p>in Nepal\'s internal affairs.  The Maoists seek "mutually </p><p>beneficial relations" with all nations, Bhattarai told </p><p>reporters, and may seek meetings with diplomatic missions, </p><p>including the U.S.  Absent from Bhattarai\'s statements thus </p><p>far has been any regret for Maoist excesses or any detailed </p><p>explanation of the proposed constituent assembly.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>BABURAM\'S BACK </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Maoist ideologue and second-ranking leader Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai entered Kathmandu publicly on the afternoon of </p><p>March 28 for the first time since the beginning of the </p><p>seven-year insurgency.  Since then, Bhattarai has conducted a </p><p>virtual media marathon, staging consecutive press conferences </p><p>on March 29 and 30, distributing prizes at a Reporters\' Club </p><p>ceremony (where he shared the dais and shook hands with Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand) on March 31, and appearing </p><p>on a popular television talk show (hosted by a former </p><p>Humphrey Fellow) the night of March 31.  Bhattarai, whom the </p><p>Maoists nominated to head their negotiating team, reportedly </p><p>also met with Nepali Congress President and former Prime </p><p>Minister G.P. Koirala on March 30, and was scheduled to meet </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) </p><p>General Secretary Madhav Nepal the following day. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p>CLAIMS CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS MEANS TO NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In his press conferences on March 29 and 30, where </p><p>he was flanked by fellow Politburo members Ram Bahadur Thapa </p><p>(aka Badal), the Maoists\' military strategist, Dev Gurung, </p><p>Krishna Mahara, and Matrika Yadav, Bhattarai stressed that </p><p>the Maoists have not relinquished their long-term goal of </p><p>establishing a communist republic.  In light of the current </p><p>situation, which Bhattarai described as one of "strategic </p><p>balance," the Maoists have amended their near-term objectives </p><p>to realization of "a new democratic system" transcending </p><p>"regressive alternatives," in which the interests of the </p><p>downtrodden (e.g., members of ethnic minorities, the lower </p><p>castes, women) will be fully represented.  The three existing </p><p>political forces (the Maoists, the parliamentary parties, and </p><p>the Palace) must each be involved in achieving this </p><p>resolution.  This new democratic model will be the "logical" </p><p>outcome of a three-step process, according to Bhattarai, that </p><p>begins with a round-table conference "of all sides."  In the </p><p>Maoist schematic, an interim government will "emanate" from </p><p>the round-table conference, which will in turn oversee </p><p>elections to a constituent assembly to draft a new </p><p>constitution.  A new constitution is imperative, Bhattarai </p><p>claimed, because "a constitutional vacuum" exists at present </p><p>and "no constitutional structure is in place."  The new </p><p>political system will represent "all forces and movements," </p><p>he declaimed to his audience on March 30, and will ""go </p><p>beyond the present multiparty system.  We are absolutely </p><p>clear there will be no return to the status quo."   He did </p><p>not, however, offer details of how the proposed new system </p><p>would differ from the multiparty system. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>CRITICIZES GON </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Bhattarai opened his March 29 address by reiterating </p><p>stock Maoist criticism of the Government of Nepal (GON) for </p><p>failing to create "a conducive environment" for dialogue. </p><p>Instead, the GON is trying "to prolong the ceasefire for an </p><p>indefinite period," Bhattarai charged, accusing it of </p><p>violating the terms of the ceasefire "by engaging in </p><p>unnecessary searches, arrests, and interference in peaceful </p><p>political programs" and declining to release Maoist </p><p>"prisoners of war." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SUGGESTS KING ABDICATE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Bhattarai also took the opportunity to replay </p><p>another recurrent Maoist theme in recent public </p><p>statements--heated denials that the Maoists had struck a </p><p>"secret" deal with the Palace or held clandestine meetings </p><p>with the King.  In his remarks to members of the foreign and </p><p>domestic press corps on March 30, Bhattarai was quoted as </p><p>claiming that the Maoists had made a number of significant </p><p>compromises to their original demands and called on the King </p><p>to show similar "flexibility."  When pressed to define the </p><p>extent of such flexibility, Bhattarai reportedly suggested </p><p>that the King could abdicate his throne. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>CHARGES US INTERFERENCE, </p><p>BUT WANTS TO MEET </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Speaking on March 30, Bhattarai declared that the </p><p>Maoists, mindful of the "sensitive geo-political" position of </p><p>their country between Indian and China, would strive to have </p><p>"cordial and mutually beneficial relations" with all foreign </p><p>countries, including their giant neighbors, based on </p><p>"principles of peaceful coexistence."  He appealed to the </p><p>international community to help "materialize" the Maoist </p><p>proposal for a constituent assembly as the "most democratic </p><p>option right now."  To that end, he said he hoped to meet </p><p>with the US, Indian, Chinese, British and EU "missions" in </p><p>Kathmandu.  (Note:  We have not been approached about such a </p><p>meeting.  End note.)  That said, the US should not interfere </p><p>in Nepal\'s internal affairs, he warned, adding that America </p><p>is "unnecessarily" interested in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Bhattarai\'s appearance in Kathmandu is a telling </p><p>indication of the importance the Maoists are placing on </p><p>possible negotiations.  Despite the suspense surrounding </p><p>Bhattarai\'s long-anticipated return to Kathmandu, however, </p><p>the Maoists\' most authoritative wordsmith had little new or </p><p>surprising to say.  Noticeably absent from his rather lengthy </p><p>remarks was any acknowledgement of or regret for the damage </p><p>and suffering wrought by the Maoists in their seven-year </p><p>insurgency.  Also missing was any discussion of the purported </p><p>deficiencies of the current Constitution that warrant </p><p>scrapping it, or how the "new" political system will ensure </p><p>the rights of the disadvantaged and underserved for whom the </p><p>Maoists claim to speak. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
