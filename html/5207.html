<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA/USOAS, S/CT, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, AORC, HO, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN DELEGATION TO CICTE IN EL SALVADOR; GOH </p><p>HAS SIGNED BUT NOT RATIFIED 1971 AND 2001 OAS CT CONVENTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 7902 </p><p> </p><p>     B. OLSEN/MAKENS E-MAILS DECEMBER 2002 </p><p>     C. TEGUCIGALPA 3318 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) PolOff delivered reftel A demarche January 10 on the </p><p>CICTE Third Regular Session January 22-24 in El Salvador to </p><p>MFA DG for Foreign Policy AMB Mario Fortin.  Fortin informed </p><p>PolOff January 16 that the Honduran delegation to the CICTE </p><p>meeting would be AMB Policarpo Callejas, Advisor to the </p><p>Foreign Minister, AMB Jaime Guell Bogran, Ambassador to El </p><p>Salvador, and Fortin. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Post notes that the GOH has signed but not ratified </p><p>either of the two OAS counterterrorism (CT) conventions (1971 </p><p>and 2001).  EmbOffs have continuously pressed the GOH to </p><p>become a party to these conventions, along with five other </p><p>international counterterrorism conventions still pending. </p><p>EmbOffs have requested a meeting with Vice Minister Anibal </p><p>Quinonez to deliver official copies in Spanish of the two OAS </p><p>CT conventions.  WHA/USOAS and WHA/CEN obtained these </p><p>documents and forwarded them to Post and Honduran OAS PermRep </p><p>AMB Salvador Redezno, at the request of the MFA Director </p><p>General for Treaties Ivonne Bonilla (ref C).  Bonilla had </p><p>said that the GOH wanted to become a party to all pending CT </p><p>conventions but claimed that the GOH first needed official </p><p>Spanish-language copies of the conventions that would be </p><p>suitable for forwarding to Congress for consideration.  Post </p><p>is guardedly optimistic that once the MFA has the official </p><p>copies of the two OAS CT conventions it will finally move to </p><p>send the two conventions to Congress for approval. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
