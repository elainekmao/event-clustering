(A) KATHMANDU 1853 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1938 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  On October 8 Maoist insurgents attacked a Norwegian </p><p>hydropower project northeast of Kathmandu, cutting its power </p><p>production in half.  The motive for the attack, according to </p><p>a Nepali employee of the company, was "out-and-out </p><p>extortion," rather than anti-Western ideolgoy.  The same day </p><p>suspected insurgents also set off a bomb in the bathroom at </p><p>the Kathmandu offices of the largest business association in </p><p>the country.  No one was injured.  On October 7 Prachanda, </p><p>the Maoist Party Chairman, released a statement reconfirming </p><p>the program of agitation announced earlier (Ref A), including </p><p>the November 11-13 general strike, or "bandh."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>KHIMTI CUT-OFF </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Late on October 8 approximately 150 Maoist </p><p>insurgents attacked the intake mechanism at the 60 MW Khimti </p><p>power project on the border between Ramechhap and Dolakha </p><p>districts northeast of Kathmandu.  The plant is now </p><p>functioning at only 50 percent capacity, according to a </p><p>source at Himal Power Company, a private Nepali shareholder </p><p>in the project.  Army troops stationed six km away at the </p><p>power house were apparently unaware of the attack when it </p><p>occurred because communications lines were cut.  No one was </p><p>injured in the attack.  A consortium of Norwegian investors, </p><p>including the state-owned Statkraft, holds an 85 percent </p><p>share in the USD 140 million project, which went on line in </p><p>late 2000. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  An official at Himal Power Company described the </p><p>attack as having been motivated by "out-and-out extortion." </p><p>Maoists had been regularly extorting money from local project </p><p>employees, but had recently upped their demands to two </p><p>percent of profits, which would amount to USD 800,000.  After </p><p>project employees refused to meet the increased demand, the </p><p>Maoists retaliated by destroying the intake.  (Note:  Power </p><p>supply to the Kathmandu Valley has not been affected by the </p><p>attack, since there is currently an oversupply of electricity </p><p>in the grid.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BOMB AT BUSINESS ASSOCIATION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Earlier in the day on October 8 suspected Maoists set </p><p>off a small explosive device in a bathroom in the Kathmandu </p><p>offices of the Federation of Nepal Chambers of Commerce and </p><p>Industry (FNCCI), Nepal\'s largest business association and a </p><p>frequent and outspoken critic of the insurgency.  No one was </p><p>injured in the blast. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO BREAK IN BANDH SCHEDULE, SAYS PRACHANDA </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  On October 7, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>Chairman Prachanda and insurgent ideologue Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>released a lengthy press statement expanding on an earlier </p><p>diatribe against the King\'s action in dismissing the </p><p>government (Ref B).  The King\'s anti-corruption admonitions </p><p>are intended only to divert public attention "from the </p><p>offenses of (Crown Prince) Paras Shah, who has for a long </p><p>time been involved in smuggling . . . and also many murder </p><p>cases."  The statement urges all Nepalis to launch "a strong </p><p>protest program" against the King\'s action by organizing "a </p><p>roundtable conference of all political parties inside and </p><p>outside Parliament, and patriotic national powers and </p><p>organizations to form an interim government to hold elections </p><p>to a constitutional assembly, disarm the Royal Army, and form </p><p>a national army."  Toward this end, Prachanda reiterated his </p><p>appeal to all Nepalis to observe the Terai general strike, or </p><p>"bandh," he had called for October 27 and the nationwide </p><p>strike called for November 11-13 (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The motivation for the attack on the Khimti power </p><p>plant appears to have been venal, rather than ideological or </p><p>specifically anti-Western.  Whatever the reason, however, the </p><p>attack is a serious setback to a government eager to attract </p><p>foreign investment to its hydropower sector.  So far public </p><p>reaction to the King\'s dismissal of the government has been </p><p>generally positive, and we expect little popular enthusiasm </p><p>for a three-day national bandh to protest his action.  At the </p><p>same time, however, we do expect the Maoists will be able, as </p><p>in the past, to enforce support for the strike through fear </p><p>and intimidation. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
