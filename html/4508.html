<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002845 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, PGOV, KHIV, VM, HIV/AIDS, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  SEX AND THE CITY -- HANOI STYLE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  01 HANOI 735 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) ADMIT THAT PROSTITUTION IS A </p><p>MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE COUNTRY.  DISCOS, KARAOKE BARS, </p><p>MASSAGE PARLORS, AND OTHER "FUN" LOCATIONS EVEN IN STAID </p><p>HANOI INCREASINGLY OFFER PROFESSIONAL OR SEMI-PROFESSIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02845  01 OF 03  261021Z </p><p>SEX SERVICES FOR SALE.  APART FROM LAMENTING THE PROBLEM, </p><p>OFFICIALS APPEAR TO DO LITTLE TO REMEDY THIS SOCIAL EVIL -- </p><p>PARTLY DUE TO CORRUPTION BUT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY </p><p>BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE SURE WHETHER THE PUBLIC WOULD RATHER </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENJOY SUCH NEWFOUND FREEDOMS OR WELCOME A </p><p>CLAMPDOWN AND RETURN TO "SOCIALIST MORALITY." </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF THE GROWING SEX </p><p>INDUSTRY ARE NO JOKE, WITH HIV/AIDS INFECTIONS RISING </p><p>STEADILY (ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT THE </p><p>LARGE MAJORITY OF INFECTIONS STEM FROM INTRAVENOUS DRUG </p><p>USE).  TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS RELATED TO PROSTITUTION ALSO </p><p>REMAINS A SERIOUS ISSUE OF CONCERN TO THE GVN, ALTHOUGH MORE </p><p>IN VIETNAM DUE TO THE EXPORT OF WOMEN THAN TO THE DOMESTIC </p><p>MARKET (REFTEL).  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT HANOI NIGHTLIFE </p><p>AND SOCIETY INCREASINGLY RESEMBLE THE REST OF SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIAN CITIES -- ESPECIALLY HO CHI MINH CITY.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH </p><p>PLENUM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) 9TH CONGRESS </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 9 ADMITTED "URGENT SOCIAL PROBLEMS" THAT NEED TO </p><p>BE ADDRESSED, NOTABLY "SOCIAL EVILS SUCH AS DRUG ADDICTION, </p><p>PROSTITUTION, AND CRIME" AS WELL AS CORRUPTION.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, IN OPENING REMARKS TO THE </p><p>SECOND SESSION OF THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON NOVEMBER 12, </p><p>REFERRED TO "URGENT SOCIAL ISSUES" AND POINTED IN PARTICULAR </p><p>TO "DRUG ADDICTION, PROSTITUTION AND CRIME."   NEITHER ARE </p><p>BRAND-NEW THEMES FOR SENIOR CPV AND GVN OFFICIALS, BUT THEIR </p><p>PROMINENCE IN THESE KEYNOTE ADDRESSES -- AS WELL AS THE </p><p>TOTAL ABSENCE OF PROPOSED SOLUTIONS -- REFLECT THE NOW "IN </p><p>YOUR FACE," ENDEMIC NATURE OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE VIETNAM </p><p>OF THE 21ST CENTURY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02845  01 OF 03  261021Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  HANOI HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING THE DOUR </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC OLDER BROTHER OF THE MORE FLASHY HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY; THIS CHARACTERIZATION IS NOT FAR OFF THE MARK.  BUT </p><p>OVER THE PAST DECADE, WITH RISING INCOMES, GROWING PERSONAL </p><p>FREEDOMS, AND DIMINISHING PUBLIC SECURITY INTRUSIONS INTO </p><p>PERSONAL LIVES, AT LEAST MANY HANOI RESIDENTS HAVE AGAIN -- </p><p>OR FOR THE FIRST TIME -- BEEN ABLE TO INDULGE IN RANGE OF </p><p>SEXUAL LICENSE THAT WOULD MAKE HO CHI MINH AND HIS </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY CONFRERES TURN OVER IN THEIR GRAVES.  (OR </p><p>MAYBE NOT; RUMORS CONTINUE TO PERSIST ABOUT CPV GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH BEING THE ILLEGITIMATE SON OF UNCLE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HO AND ONE OF HIS SERVANTS.) </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>DISCO LIVES! </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  AT LEAST THREE DISCOS IN HANOI CATER TO THE WELL- </p><p>HEELED TWENTY- AND THIRTY-SOMETHING VIETNAMESE OF HANOI; </p><p>ALL, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, SPORT ENGLISH NAMES:  "NEW </p><p>CENTURY," "MAGIC MOO," AND "SPARK."  ANOTHER, "APOCALYPSE </p><p>NOW," CATERS PRIMARILY TO A WESTERN CROWD BUT HAS A SIZEABLE </p><p>AND APPARENTLY INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF LOCALS.  COGNAC -- </p><p>AT PRICES THAT IN THE COURSE OF AN EVENING COULD EASILY EAT </p><p>UP THE ANNUAL PER CAPITA INCOME OF THE AVERAGE VIETNAMESE -- </p><p>AND BEER ARE THE BEVERAGES OF CHOICE.  CONVENTIONAL WISDOM </p><p>HOLDS THAT "NEW CENTURY" IS ALSO A POPULAR SITE FOR DRUG </p><p>PURCHASES AND EVEN USAGE, ESPECIALLY OF METHAMPHETAMINES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  WHAT ALL THESE CLUBS HAVE IN COMMON ARE, UNUSUALLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02845  01 OF 03  261021Z </p><p>FOR VIETNAM, LARGE NUMBERS OF UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG LADIES WHO </p><p>ARE REMARKABLY FRIENDLY TO STRANGE MEN.  MANY, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>THE UPSCALE "NEW CENTURY," EVEN SPORT LONG, SLINKY EVENING </p><p>GOWNS (WHICH MUST BE A TRICK TO WEAR WHEN ARRIVING BY </p><p>MOTORCYCLE, AS VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CLIENTELE DOES).  BASIC </p><p>POLITENESS REQUIRES GENTLEMEN WHO DANCE WITH THEM TO BUY AT </p><p>LEAST ONE DRINK PER DANCE; EVERYTHING FROM THERE ON OUT </p><p>APPEARS NEGOTIABLE.  UNLIKE THE MIDNIGHT CURFEW THAT HAS HIT </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY\'S DISCO SCENE IN RECENT YEARS, HANOI\'S </p><p>CLUBS STAY OPEN -- AND OFTEN STRANGELY FULL -- INTO THE </p><p>EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SING, SING A SONG </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  KARAOKE HAS EXPLODED ONTO THE HANOI SCENE WITH A </p><p>VENGEANCE; THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF KARAOKE BARS -- </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED -- SCATTERED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE CITY.  THEY RANGE FROM LUXURY ESTABLISHMENTS </p><p>AT THE DAEWOO AND FORTUNA HOTELS TO BARE MINIMUM HUTS ALONG </p><p>THE ROAD TO THE AIRPORT AND ELSEWHERE.  THE MAIN ROAD NORTH </p><p>OUT OF HANOI THROUGH ITS GIA LAM DISTRICT -- JUST ACROSS THE </p><p>DOWNTOWN CITY BRIDGE SPANNING THE RED RIVER -- IS KNOWN BY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2625 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02845  02 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   EVG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------0E92E1  261022Z /38 </p><p>R 260957Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8196 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 002845 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LOCALS AS "HONG KONG HANOI" DUE TO ITS HEAVY CONCENTRATION </p><p>OF KARAOKE BARS AND OTHER "ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS."  MOST OF </p><p>THESE KARAOKE BARS CARRY THE FULL RANGE OF SONGS, INCLUDING </p><p>NOT ONLY VIETNAMESE FAVORITES BUT ALSO A SURPRISINGLY BROAD </p><p>SELECTION OF ENGLISH, CHINESE, AND KOREAN TUNES.  (RANDOM </p><p>SAMPLINGS SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBER OF HANOI RESIDENTS WHO </p><p>KNOW "SEALED WITH A KISS" AND "UNCHAINED MELODY" IN ENGLISH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02845  02 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>FAR OUTNUMBERS COUNTERPART GROUPS IN THE U.S.)  MOST KARAOKE </p><p>OFFER AT LEAST ONE -- IN SOME CASES, DOZENS -- OF PRIVATE </p><p>ROOMS FOR MORE DISCREET CROONING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  PROBABLY BECAUSE SINGING CAN BE A LONELY BUSINESS, </p><p>MANY KARAOKE BARS EMPLOY A STABLE OF USUALLY VERY GOOD- </p><p>LOOKING "HOSTESSES," WHOSE SINGING ABILITIES VARY </p><p>CONSIDERABLY.  VIETNAMESE CALL THIS KIND OF KARAOKE BARS </p><p>"KARAOKE OM" -- CUDDLE KARAOKE.  THE HOSTESSES ARE GENEROUS </p><p>WITH THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR OTHERWISE UNTALENTED RENDITIONS OF </p><p>POPULAR TUNES, BUT ALSO WILLING -- NAY, EAGER -- TO KEEP THE </p><p>MALE SINGERS WARM AGAINST THE CHILL OF AIR CONDITIONED ROOMS </p><p>IN THE HANOI HEAT.  MOST, ACCORDING TO ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE, </p><p>ARE ALSO QUITE WILLING TO GET OFF WORK EARLY TO GO ON TO </p><p>OTHER NOCTURNAL ACTIVITIES, IN EXCHANGE FOR CERTAIN MONETARY </p><p>COMPENSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>RELAX -- THE "THAI" WAY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  A REAL BOON FOR HANOI RESIDENTS WITH BAD BACKS OR </p><p>STIFF NECKS, INTER ALIA, HAS BEEN THE PROLIFERATION OVER THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF AT LEAST HUNDREDS OF MASSAGE CENTERS, </p><p>OFTEN HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THEY OFFER "THAI-STYLE" </p><p>MASSAGES.  (ODDLY, THE VIETNAMESE TERM "XOA BOP" IS </p><p>GRADUALLY GIVING WAY IN THE LINGUA FRANCA AS WELL AS ON </p><p>SIGNS TO A MORE VIET-ENGLISH "MASSAT" OR THE STRAIGHTFORWARD </p><p>USE OF THE ENGLISH WORD.)  AN ASTONISHINGLY HIGH PERCENTAGE </p><p>OF THESE MASSEUSES APPEAR TO BE ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADIES, </p><p>MANY OF WHOM CLAIM TO BE FROM OUT OF TOWN.  (FOR SOME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02845  02 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>REASON, MANY DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS SAIGON NATIVES; MAYBE </p><p>THEY ARE.)  VIRTUALLY ALL APPARENTLY OFFER PRIVATE ROOMS, </p><p>SOME WITH ATTACHED BATHS.  ONE NEW MULTI-STORY </p><p>"ENTERTAINMENT CENTER," WHOSE ELABORATE STATUARY AND OTHER </p><p>DECORATION HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY SOME OBSERVERS AS "CLASSIC </p><p>BROTHEL STYLE," IS JUST A COUPLE OF DOORS DOWN THE STREET </p><p>FROM THE US EMBASSY AND WAS REPORTEDLY BUILT AT A PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT OF SEVERAL MILLION US DOLLARS.  IT INCLUDES NOT </p><p>ONLY SEVERAL FLOORS OF INDIVIDUAL MASSAGE ROOMS BUT ALSO </p><p>SAUNAS, A SMALL SWIMMING POOL, SEVERAL RESTAURANTS, A BAR, </p><p>AND A KARAOKE LOUNGE, AS WELL AS SOME OFFICES AND APARTMENTS </p><p>NOW AVAILABLE FOR RENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  ACCORDING TO MANY HABITUS OF THE MASSAGE SCENE, </p><p>THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS NOT THE MASSAGE ITSELF OR EVEN OF </p><p>OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE PREMISES.  RATHER, THE </p><p>ATTRACTION IS THE WILLINGNESS OF THE MASSEUSES TO "GO OUT" </p><p>WITH THE CLIENT AFTERWARDS.  HOWEVER, SOME MANAGERS </p><p>QUAINTLY PROMISE "HAPPY ENDING MASSAGES" TO WOULD-BE MALE </p><p>CLIENTS AT THEIR MASSAGE CENTERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>REST FOR THE WEARY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  WHERE ARE ALL THESE NEWLY FORMED COUPLES HEADING? </p><p>TO ONE OF THE SEEMINGLY UBIQUITOUS "NHA NGHI" -- REST HOUSES </p><p>-- THAT DOT THE URBAN (AND MORE AND MORE, EVEN THE RURAL) </p><p>LANDSCAPE.  AGAIN, MOST ARE SMALL ESTABLISHMENTS, PRIVATELY </p><p>OWNED, AND ASK FEW QUESTIONS OF THEIR GUESTS, UNLIKE HOTELS </p><p>AND GUESTHOUSES, WHICH USUALLY REQUIRE THE DEPOSIT OF A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02845  02 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT ID CARD AND/OR FOREIGN PASSPORT TO RENT A ROOM. </p><p>MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE "REST HOUSES" OFTEN OFFER ROOMS BY </p><p>THE HOUR FOR THOSE QUICK NAPS -- OR TRYSTS.  AT ABOUT USD 7 </p><p>AN HOUR, THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THE BEST BARGAINS IN HANOI, BUT </p><p>ARE NOT OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE LOCAL CLIENTELE.  SOME, BUT </p><p>PROBABLY NOT EVEN MOST, OFFER YOUNG HOSTESSES OF THEIR OWN </p><p>FOR OTHER SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE -- INCLUDING FROM THE USUALLY </p><p>RELIABLE STAPLE OF POLOFFS EVERYWHERE, TAXI DRIVERS -- </p><p>INDICATE THAT THE COST OF SHORT-TIME SEXUAL SERVICES RANGE </p><p>FROM 100,000 VIETNAMESE DONG (USD 7) UPWARD.  VIETNAMESE MEN </p><p>CALL STEPPING OUT FOR ONE OF THESE EXTRAMARITAL LIAISONS </p><p>"EATING PHO" (THE CLASSIC VIETNAMESE NOODLE SOUP), IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO "EATING RICE" AT HOME.  AS IN OTHER ASIAN </p><p>CULTURES, MANY HANOI MEN TEND TO GO OFF AND "EAT PHO" ALONG </p><p>WITH THEIR BUDDIES, RATHER THAN ON THEIR OWN, OFTEN AFTER AN </p><p>EVENING IN A BEER HALL AND/OR KARAOKE AND/OR MASSAGE.  WHILE </p><p>OF COURSE MANY -- PERHAPS EVEN MOST -- HANOI MEN MAY NEVER </p><p>ENGAGE IN THIS STILL ILLEGAL PASTIME, RANDOM SAMPLES SUGGEST </p><p>THAT MANY MALES DO SO ABOUT ONCE A MONTH, AND THAT THE FIRST </p><p>SEXUAL EXPERIENCE OF MOST HANOI MEN PROBABLY TAKES ONE OF </p><p>THESE FORMS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2627 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02845  03 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   EVG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------0E92FB  261022Z /38 </p><p>R 260957Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8197 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 002845 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>DOWN BY THE LAKE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.

(DRUG USE HERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM; USED SYRINGES DOT </p><p>THE PARK, AND THE BENCHES ARE FULL OF SLEEPING ADDICTS AT </p><p>ALL HOURS.)  EXPAT FOLKLORE HAS IT THAT THIS PARK WAS A </p><p>CENTER FOR FURTIVE HOMOSEXUAL ENCOUNTERS AS LONG AGO AS THE </p><p>EARLY 1980S.  NOWADAYS, THE HOAN KIEM LAKE (LAKE OF THE </p><p>RETURNED SWORD) -- THE SPIRITUAL IF NO LONGER PHYSICAL </p><p>CENTER OF DOWNTOWN HANOI -- OFFERS AGGRESSIVELY FRIENDLY </p><p>YOUNG MEN COURTING CLIENTS; EMBASSY ADVICE TO TRAVELERS IS </p><p>TO STAY OUT OF THE PUBLIC TOILETS THERE UNLESS EXPLICITLY </p><p>SEEKING AN ENCOUNTER OF ANOTHER KIND. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IT\'S NO JOKE, HOWEVER </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT IN THE OFFICIAL </p><p>MEDIA, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS PREDICTED THAT THE NUMBER </p><p>OF PEOPLE IN VIETNAM INFECTED WITH HIV/AIDS WILL REACH </p><p>200,000 BY 2005.  ALREADY, ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, 154,244 </p><p>PEOPLE ARE INFECTED, 23,605 CASES WITH FULL-BLOWN AIDS, AND </p><p>20,089 ON THE VERGE OF DEATH.  THE NATIONAL AIDS STANDING </p><p>BUREAU OFFICIALLY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED ONLY 56,495 HIV CARRIERS </p><p>(13,000 OF WHOM WERE IDENTIFIED SO FAR IN 2002), AS WELL AS </p><p>A TOTAL OF 4,649 DEATHS (1,096 IN 2002) AND 8,450 CURRENT </p><p>AIDS PATIENTS, ACCORDING TO ANOTHER REPORT IN THE OFFICIAL </p><p>MEDIA.  MOST GVN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT THE </p><p>LARGE MAJORITY OF INFECTIONS STEM FROM INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THIS TREND IS NOW </p><p>SHIFTING IN FAVOR OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS.  GVN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02845  03 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE NOTED PRIVATELY THAT HIV/AIDS INFECTION BY A </p><p>PRISON INMATE IS SOMETIMES A FACTOR IN WINNING AN AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  AS NOTED IN REFTEL SUBMISSION TO THE ANNUAL ANTI- </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT, TRAFFICKING IN VIETNAM </p><p>REMAINS AN ISSUE OF CONCERN TO THE GVN AND OTHER OBSERVERS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE USG.  HOWEVER, MOST TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN </p><p>APPEARS TO BE AIMED AT FOREIGN AUDIENCES, ALTHOUGH SOME </p><p>TRAFFICKING FROM RURAL TO URBAN AREAS FOR THE PURPOSES OF </p><p>PROSTITUTION EXISTS.  ECONOMIC INCENTIVES ARE MORE LIKELY </p><p>FACTORS TO INDUCE YOUNG WOMEN VOLUNTARILY INTO PROFESSIONAL </p><p>OR SEMI-PROFESSIONAL PROSTITUTION DOMESTICALLY, HOWEVER. </p><p>WITHIN HANOI, THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CHILD SEX </p><p>PROSTITUTION SO ABHORRENT IN OTHER NEAR-BY COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  NO RELIABLE ESTIMATES EXIST ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE </p><p>ARE ENGAGED -- FULL-TIME, PART-TIME, FREE-LANCE, EMPLOYED -- </p><p>IN PROSTITUTION IN HANOI THESE DAYS, BUT THE NUMBERS APPEAR </p><p>TO BE GROWING.  HANOI STILL (AS FAR AS EMBASSY KNOWS) HAS </p><p>NOTHING LIKE DE FACTO BROTHELS OR BANGKOK-STYLE "MASSAGE </p><p>PARLORS," BUT THE RANGE OF OTHER OPTIONS HAS DEVELOPED </p><p>MARKEDLY AND IS CLEARLY MEETING SOME MARKET DEMANDS.  THE </p><p>RESPONSE OF POLICE AND SECURITY OFFICIALS TO ALL OF THESE </p><p>TRENDS APPEARS WEAK, EVEN INDIFFERENT.  THE CLEAR </p><p>IMPLICATION IS THAT, AS ELSEWHERE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, </p><p>CORRUPTION IS EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING POLICE AWAY AND OFF OF </p><p>THE BACKS OF THESE DEMIMONDE ENTREPRENEURS.  IT IS NO WONDER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02845  03 OF 03  261022Z </p><p>THAT THE GVN AND CPV FEEL COMPELLED TO ADMIT THE GROWING </p><p>PREVALENCE OF SOCIAL EVILS.  WHAT THEY MAY NOT YET HAVE A </p><p>GOOD GAUGE FOR IS WHETHER THE HANOI PUBLIC WOULD RATHER </p><p>THESE SOCIAL EVILS CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE, OR WHETHER THEY </p><p>WOULD PREFER AUTHORITIES MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS.  IT MAY BE </p><p>THIS INDECISION THAT PREVENTS A MORE VIGOROUS OFFICIAL </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM OF PROSTITUTION IN HANOI AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT HANOI\'S </p><p>NIGHTLIFE AND SOCIETY INCREASINGLY RESEMBLE THOSE OF OTHER </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIAN CITIES -- ESPECIALLY HO CHI MINH CITY. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
