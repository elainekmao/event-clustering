For one thing, the wall means the </p><p>failure of Israel\'s military option and also means </p><p>that Israel is building because of pressure from the </p><p>Palestinian resistance.  A second positive point is </p><p>the fact that, with the building of this wall, </p><p>Israel\'s ideology of a Greater Israel has become </p><p>obsolete.  Another point is the fact that this is the </p><p>first time that Israel establishes borders between </p><p>itself and areas it used to occupy, political borders </p><p>that will be hard to change in the future.  A fourth </p><p>and final point is the destruction of the very </p><p>foundations of the settlement movement in the West </p><p>Bank." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
