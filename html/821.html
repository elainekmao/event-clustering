<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 001338 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:  OADR 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, ECON, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: THE CROWN PRINCE\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>          REFORM, GULF WAR SPENDING, ISRAEL AND IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RIYADH 0023, B. RIYADH 0029 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE KATTOUF: 1.5 B,D. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A SELF-CONFIDENT CROWN PRINCE, OBVIOUSLY AT </p><p>HOME WITH HIS EXPANDED AUTHORITY, SEPARATELY LECTURED </p><p>FORMER U.S. AMBASSADORS TO SAUDI ARABIA, A/S RICHARD </p><p>MURPHY AND CHAS FREEMAN, ON THE UNFAIR FINANCIAL BURDEN </p><p>THE U.S. PLACED ON SAUDI ARABIA DURING THE GULF WAR. </p><p>ECHOING SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED MORE FORCEFULLY BY MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES AND OTHER COMMONERS, ABDULLAH STATED THAT THE </p><p>SAG SPENT "FAR TOO MUCH" AND QUESTIONED U.S. MOTIVES IN </p><p>EXACTING THE FINANCIAL TOLL.  INDICATING THAT MORE </p><p>BELT-TIGHTENING WAS IN ORDER, THE CROWN PRINCE ALLUDED </p><p>TO THE NEED TO "UNIFY" THE SAUDI BUDGET, WHICH FREEMAN </p><p>INTERPRETED TO MEAN BRINGING ON-BUDGET THE MAMMOTH </p><p>OFF-BUDGET MONIES DEVOTED TO THE MOSQUE RECONSTRUCTION, </p><p>AL-YAMAMAH WEAPONS DEAL, AND THE STRATEGIC (OIL) STORAGE </p><p>PROJECT.  ABDULLAH QUESTIONED U.S. ALLEGATIONS OF A </p><p>LIBYAN CHEMICAL CAPABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF USG </p><p>SILENCE ON ISRAEL\'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  FINALLY, </p><p>ABDULLAH URGED THAT THE U.S. FIND COMMON GROUND ON WHICH </p><p>TO CONSTRUCTIVELY, OR AT LEAST COMMERCIALLY, ENGAGE </p><p>IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S REMARKS, AND WE ASSUME THEY WERE </p><p>CONVEYED ACCURATELY BY THE TWO FORMER AMBASSADORS, SHOW </p><p>THAT THE CROWN PRINCE APPEARS WILLING TO CHALLENGE A </p><p>NUMBER OF BASIC TENETS OF RULE BY THE AL FAHD.  PLACING </p><p>THE OFF-BUDGET ITEMS IN THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET, LONG A </p><p>GOAL OF REFORMERS HERE, WOULD WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF THE </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY TO CARRY OUT THE PERSONAL LARGESSE THAT IT </p><p>HAS OFTEN USED TO ENSURE FAMILY UNITY AND BUY THE </p><p>LOYALTY OF ITS SUBJECTS.  (IT COULD ALSO PROVE </p><p>DETRIMENTAL TO THE PALACE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.) </p><p>OVERALL, THE CROWN PRINCE\'S VIEWS REFLECT A SAUDI RULER </p><p>WHO MIGHT TAKE REFORM OF THE OLD REGIME SERIOUSLY, WHO </p><p>LIKELY ENDORSES THE SAG\'S LESS RESPONSIVE STANCE TO U.S. </p><p>REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>INITIATIVES AND COMMERCIAL DEALS, BUT WHO MAY BE MORE IN </p><p>TUNE WITH THE SAUDI POPULACE.  AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS THAT IT IS A LOT EASIER TO ESPOUSE REFORM, </p><p>THAN IT IS TO ACHIEVE IT, PARTICULARLY IN A POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEM BASED ON FAMILY CONSENSUS AND COMPROMISE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  IN THE LAST WEEK, TWO FORMER AMBASSADORS TO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, RICHARD MURPHY AND CHAS FREEMAN, VISITED </p><p>RIYADH AND SEPARATELY RELATED TO THE AMBASSADOR AND POL </p><p>COUNSELOR THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF THE POST-GULF WAR SAUDI </p><p>POLITICAL ORDER, BASED ON MEETINGS WITH THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE, MORE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD, AND MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES IN RIYADH AND JEDDAH.  MURPHY IS A FREQUENT </p><p>TRAVELLER TO SAUDI ARABIA (THIS TRIP WAS UNDER THE </p><p>AUSPICES OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS), WHILE </p><p>FREEMAN\'S VISIT WAS HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO CALL UPON </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE SINCE HIS DEPARTURE IN AUGUST 1992. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ABDULLAH ASCENDANT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  FREEMAN DESCRIBED A RELAXED, YOUNGER-LOOKING, </p><p>AND MORE CONFIDENT CROWN PRINCE WHO, IN THE COURSE OF </p><p>THE HOUR LONG MEETING, DID NOT ONCE STUTTER.  DESPITE </p><p>HIS IMPLICIT ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE CURRENT POLITICAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENT -- WITH THE KING TECHNICALLY BACK IN CHARGE </p><p>BUT, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, ISOLATED IN JEDDAH -- </p><p>IS AWKWARD, ABDULLAH EXUDED SELF-CONFIDENCE AND GREATER </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  MURPHY TOO COMMENTED ON ABDULLAH\'S UNUSUALLY </p><p>RELAXED AND RELATIVELY LOQUACIOUS STYLE AND SECONDED </p><p>FREEMAN\'S IMPRESSION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE IS ENJOYING </p><p>HIS EXPANDED RESPONSIBILITIES.  MURPHY RELATED THAT </p><p>WHILE ABDULLAH SIMPLY STATED THAT FAHD IS "FINE," A </p><p>CLOSE ARAB FRIEND OF THE KING\'S HAD TOLD HIM THAT DURING </p><p>A RECENT PHONE CONVERSATION WITH FAHD, THE KING FALTERED </p><p>AND THEN WAS HEARD ASKING SOMEONE "WHO AM I SPEAKING </p><p>WITH?"  FREEMAN\'S REQUEST TO MEET WITH THE KING WAS MET </p><p>WITH SILENCE BY ROYAL PROTOCOL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BOTH FORMER AMBASSADORS WERE TOLD BY FAMILIES </p><p>WHO ENJOY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AL SAUD THAT </p><p>FAHD\'S BROTHERS ARE CONCERNED THAT HE MAY BE TAKEN </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF BY HIS AVARICIOUS IN-LAWS, THE </p><p>AL-IBRAHIMS.  JEDDAH MERCHANT FAMILIES BELIEVE RIYADH </p><p>GOVERNOR PRINCE SALMAN\'S CONTINUED PRESENCE IN JEDDAH BY </p><p>THE KING\'S SIDE IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO FEND OFF EFFORTS </p><p>BY AL-JAWHARA (THE KING\'S FAVORITE WIFE), HER SON ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ (THE KING\'S FAVORITE SON), AND HER BROTHERS, THE </p><p>AL-IBRAHIMS, TO SECURE A GREATER PORTION OF THE KING\'S </p><p>ASSETS.  ACCORDING TO THESE REPORTS, AL-JAWHARA AND ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ ARE UNEASY WITH THE GRADUAL CEDING OF POLITICAL </p><p>AUTHORITY TO THE CROWN PRINCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>PICKING UP THE TAB: THE UNPLEASANT GULF WAR MEMORY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ABDULLAH TOOK BOTH MEN TO TASK FOR WHAT HE </p><p>JUDGED TO BE THE UNFAIR FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON THE </p><p>SAUDI ECONOMY BY THE U.S. DURING DESERT SHIELD/STORM. </p><p>REFERRING TO JIM BAKER\'S MEMOIRES, THE CROWN PRINCE TOLD </p><p>FREEMAN HE APPRECIATED HIS EFFORTS DURING THE WAR TO </p><p>CONVINCE THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE TO MODERATE HIS </p><p>FINANCIAL DEMANDS.  IN CONTRAST TO THE EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE </p><p>ABDULLAH PAID TO THE U.S. FORCES SIX MONTHS AFTER THE </p><p>WAR, IN THIS MOST RECENT MEETING WITH MURPHY THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE SPONTANEOUSLY REMARKED, "WE SPENT FAR TOO MUCH ON </p><p>THE GULF WAR," AND QUERIED "WHY DID YOU GET US TO SPEND </p><p>SO MUCH?"  IN RESPONSE, MURPHY STATED THAT AT THE TIME </p><p>WE WERE CONCERNED OVER ENGAGING THE FOURTH LARGEST ARMY </p><p>IN THE WORLD AND THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE ON IRAQ WAS </p><p>ALWAYS WEAK.  ABDULLAH SNAPPED IN RESPONSE, "WHERE WAS </p><p>THE CIA, SLEEPING?...IS IT ANY BETTER NOW?"  THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE CONCLUDED BY NOTING, "WELL, THE MONEY IS GONE, </p><p>SPENT." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  AMONG THE PRIVATE SECTOR, REACTION TO THE </p><p>FINANCIAL AFTER-SHOCKS OF THE GULF WAR IS "VIOLENT," </p><p>ACCORDING TO FREEMAN.  WHILE CAREFUL TO COUPLE THEIR </p><p>CRITICISMS WITH APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. MILITARY </p><p>RESPONSE, SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TOLD FREEMAN THAT THE U.S. </p><p>TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN ALLY IN A TIME OF CRISIS. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, FREEMAN WAS LECTURED, THE PROMOTION OF </p><p>LARGE COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AFTER THE WAR, SUCH AS THE </p><p>BOEING AIRPLANE DEAL, FURTHER REDUCES THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS DOMESTIC ARREARS.  BASED ON </p><p>HIS MEETINGS WITH THE MAJOR MERCHANT FAMILIES, FREEMAN </p><p>HAZARDED THAT THE SAG OWES BETWEEN 12-15 BILLION USD IN </p><p>ARREARS.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY ESTIMATES PLACE ARREARS AT </p><p>10-13 BILLION USD.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S PLATFORM: UNITED BUDGET, LESS CORRUPTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  ABDULLAH INDICATED TO FREEMAN THAT HE WAS </p><p>PREPARED TO TACKLE SAUDI ARABIA\'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES </p><p>HEAD-ON.  NOTING THAT MORE ECONOMIC BELT-TIGHTENING </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE IMPOSED, THE CROWN PRINCE AGREED THAT </p><p>SOME MEASURE OF AUSTERITY MIGHT PROVIDE A VALUABLE </p><p>LESSON FOR SAUDI YOUTH, WHO, ABDULLAH BELIEVES, HAVE </p><p>BECOME TOO SOFT DURING THE BOOM YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO LEADING QUESTIONS FROM </p><p>FREEMAN,  THE CROWN PRINCE OPAQUELY COMMENTED ON THE </p><p>NEED TO "UNIFY" THE SAUDI BUDGET, WHICH FREEMAN READ TO </p><p>MEAN INCORPORATING INTO THE BUDGET THE OFF-BUDGET </p><p>EXPENDITURES RELATED O THE "RECONSTRUCTION" OF THE TWO </p><p>HOLY MOSQUES IN MECCA AND MEDINA, THE SAG-UK AL-YAMAMAH </p><p>WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND THE STRATEGIC STORAGE PROJECT. </p><p>(NOTE: IT IS FROM THESE PROJECTS, WHOSE ESTIMATED 12 </p><p>BILLION USD BUDGETS SIDESTEP THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, </p><p>THAT THE KING AND MINDEF SULTAN ARE BELIEVED TO DIVERT </p><p>GREAT SUMS INTO THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OR TO COMPANIES </p><p>IN WHICH ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE AN INTEREST.)  THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE NOTED IN GENERAL TERMS THAT SUCH A TASK </p><p>WOULD NOT BE EASY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  A FURTHER INDICATION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE </p><p>WILL EMBRACE AN ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE AS PART OF HIS </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA, FREEMAN CONTINUED, IS THE TIGHT </p><p>SURVEILLANCE THAT ABDULLAH KEEPS HIS SONS UNDER WHEN IT </p><p>COMES TO PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE AWARE THAT ABDULLAH\'S PROGENY, SUCH </p><p>AS DEPUTY SANG COMMANDER PRINCE MITIB, ARE NOT LACKING </p><p>IN AVARICE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ABDULLAH ON ISRAEL AND IRAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  COMING ON THE HEELS OF A TELEPHONE </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK, THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE QUESTIONED MURPHY CLOSELY ABOUT LIBYAN CHEMICAL </p><p>CAPABILITIES.  ABDULLAH, MURPHY NOTED, REMARKED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. HAS MADE AGAIN ACCUSATIONS OF A COVERT WEAPONS </p><p>PROGRAM AGAINST LIBYA AND PAKISTAN, YET HAS SAID NOTHING </p><p>ABOUT ISRAEL\'S NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  ABDULLAH EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT ARAFAT CANNOT ACCEPT ANY SETTLEMENT WHICH IS UNJUST </p><p>AND STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT BEING </p><p>METED OUT BY ISRAEL AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS.  MURPHY </p><p>URGED ABDULLAH NOT TO EXAGGERATE THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>DIMENSION, WHICH CAN BE REMEDIED QUICKLY, BUT FOCUS ON </p><p>WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SHORE UP THE POLITICAL WILL OF BOTH </p><p>PERES AND ARAFAT TO MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  REPEATING COMMENTS WHICH HE FIRST MADE TO </p><p>MURPHY IN NOVEMBER 1995, THE CROWN PRINCE URGED THE </p><p>UNITED STATES TO FIND AN ARENA IN WHICH TO ENGAGE IRAN, </p><p>ESSENTIALLY ENDORSING THE EUROPEAN UNION\'S POLICY OF </p><p>CRITICAL DIALOGUE.  ABDULLAH CHARACTERIZED THE TRADE </p><p>EMBARGO AS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE U.S.\'S LONG-TERM </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S REMARKS, AS REPORTED BY THE TWO </p><p>AMBASSADORS, REFLECT A RULER WHO TAKES ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>SERIOUSLY; WHO, AS KING, LIKELY WILL SHARPEN THE PATTERN </p><p>OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS UNDER FAHD\'S TENURE OF </p><p>DECLINING RECEPTIVITY TO APPEALS BY THE USG FOR DONOR </p><p>AID TO SUPPORT FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES; BUT WHO IS </p><p>MORE IN TUNE, ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY, WITH HIS </p><p>SUBJECTS.  WHILE FREEMAN DESCRIBED HIS CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>ABDULLAH ON ECONOMIC REFORM AS PART KABUKI THEATER, HE </p><p>LEFT THE MEETING CONVINCED (AS ABDULLAH\'S RIGHT HAND </p><p>MAN, SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ AL-TUWAIJRI, HAS OFTEN TRIED TO </p><p>CONVINCE US - REFTELS) THAT ABDULLAH IS SERIOUS ABOUT </p><p>REFORMING BOTH THE SAUDI ECONOMY AND THE ROYAL FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  IF HE WERE TO SUCCEED IN "UNIFYING" THE </p><p>BUDGET, WHICH HAS LONG BEEN THE GOAL OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S </p><p>TECHNOCRATS, ABDULLAH WOULD REMOVE FROM THE </p><p>DISCRETIONARY SPHERE THE FUNDS WITH WHICH THE AL FAHD </p><p>HAVE USED TO SUPPORT THEIR LAVISH LIFESTYLE, AS WELL AS </p><p>DISTRIBUTING TO THEIR SUPPORTERS.  ABDULLAH\'S STATEMENTS </p><p>MAY REFLECT HIS OWN FRUSTRATION AT HAVING THE KINGDOM\'S </p><p>DISCRETIONARY FUNDS TIED UP IN OFF-BUDGET, AL </p><p>FAHD-CONTROLLED, PROJECTS.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS EASIER </p><p>TO ENDORSE REFORM AS A CROWN PRINCE, THAN IT IS TO </p><p>EFFECT IT AS A KING.  REGARDLESS OF ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>CREDENTIALS AS A REFORMER, HIS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>AGENDA WILL REQUIRE HIS ACHIEVING A FAMILY CONSENSUS </p><p>THAT WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE COMPROMISES WITH THE VERY </p><p>PRINCES WHOSE LIVELIHOOD HIS REFORMS WOULD THREATEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
