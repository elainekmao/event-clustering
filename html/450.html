<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 RIYADH 03320 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USIA </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR NEA, P/G, P/M, P/FW, P/PFN, R </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PROP, PGOV, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SAUDI PRESS: PROFILES OF INDIVIDUAL PAPERS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) RIYADH 3311 (B) RIYADH 2749 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  THIS CABLE GIVES BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF </p><p>SAUDI DAILY NEWSPAPERS, THEIR INDIVIDUAL ORIGINS, SPECIAL </p><p>SLANTS, AND ESTIMATED CIRCULATION FIGURES.  (ONLY </p><p>"AL-HAYAT," A SAUDI-CONTROLLED DAILY PUBLISHED IN LONDON </p><p>IS NOT INCLUDED).  REF A DESCRIBED THE STRUCTURE OF THE </p><p>SAUDI PRESS ESTABLISHMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>INHIBITORS ON PRESS FREEDOM, AND THE POSSIBLE LOCAL </p><p>IMPACT OF THE INVASION OF SAUDI ARABIA BY THE FOREIGN </p><p>PRESS DURING OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/STORM.  REF B </p><p>COVERED INCREASED SAUDI INVESTMENT, AND POSSIBLE EFFORTS </p><p>TO HAVE MORE EDITORIAL INFLUENCE, IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ARABIC PRESS.  POST WILL PROVIDE STATE AND USIA MEDIA </p><p>ELEMENTS WITH A SEPARATE UNCLASSIFIED PROFILE, EXTRACTED </p><p>FROM THIS CABLE, FOR DESKTOP REFERENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  "AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT" (SAUDI-OWNED, LONDON-BASED, </p><p>MODERATE, INTERNAL CIRCULATION: 100,000-125,000, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CIRCULATION: 200,000-300,000).  FOUNDED IN </p><p>1977, "AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT" IS SAUDI ARABIA\'S MOST </p><p>INFLUENTIAL PUBLICATION AND ARGUABLY ONE OF THE TWO OR </p><p>THREE MOST INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPERS IN THE ARAB WORLD. </p><p>"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT" IS PRINTED IN RIYADH, JEDDAH, CAIRO, </p><p>DHAHRAN, CASABLANCA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, MARSEILLE, PARIS, </p><p>AND NEW YORK.  OWNERS OF RECORD ARE THE AL-HAFIZ FAMILY, </p><p>BUT THE GOVERNOR OF RIYADH, PRINCE SALMAN BIN ABDUL AZIZ </p><p>AL SAUD (A FULL BROTHER OF KING FAHD) IS RUMORED TO BE A </p><p>MAJOR BEHIND-THE-SCENES INVESTOR IN THE PAPER.  "AL-SHARQ </p><p>AL-AWSAT\'S" INFLUENCE IS MORE RELATED TO THE GLOBAL REACH </p><p>OF THE PAPER THAN THE COLORFULNESS OF ITS EDITORIAL </p><p>WRITING, BUT A FEW WRITERS (NOTABLY SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>BAHRAIN, GHAZI AL-GOSAIBI) HAVE DEVOTED FOLLOWINGS.  THE </p><p>PAPER FREQUENTLY TAKES A MORE MODERATE STANCE ON </p><p>ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUES THAN OTHER SAUDI NEWSPAPERS </p><p>REFLECTING THE DIFFERING VIEWS AND MORE COSMOPOLITAN </p><p>NATURE OF ITS INTERNATIONAL READERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  "UKAZ" (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED </p><p>CIRCULATION: 110,000-125,000).  SISTER PAPER OF THE </p><p>"SAUDI GAZETTE."  FOUNDED IN 1960, "UKAZ" IS THE MOST </p><p>POPULAR PAPER IN THE HIJAZ AND THE MOST WIDELY-CIRCULATED </p><p>DAILY IN SAUDI ARABIA DUE TO DECLINING COMPETITION FROM </p><p>OTHER HIJAZI PAPERS.  IN MID-1980S, "UKAZ" WAS OFTEN </p><p>PERCEIVED AS A NEWSPAPER IN DECLINE DUE TO FAILURE TO </p><p>INVEST IN MODERNIZATION, BUT HAS INVESTED IN IMPROVED </p><p>PRINTING FACILITIES AND STEADILY EXPANDED CIRCULATION. </p><p>DURING NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1990, THE SAUDI PRESS LURCHED </p><p>TOWARDS SENSATIONALISM AND YELLOW JOURNALISM IN SMEARING </p><p>STATES PERCEIVED AS PRO-IRAQI.  "UKAZ" WAS GENERALLY </p><p>VIEWED AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND SENSATIONALIST IN </p><p>PRINTING SUCH STORIES, PARTICULARLY STORIES DIRECTED </p><p>AGAINST YEMEN AND PRESIDENT SALEH OR THE OCCASIONAL </p><p>"INSPIRED LIE," SUCH AS A RECENT REPORT OF THE DEATH OF </p><p>SADDAM.  LIKE PULITZER AND HEARST OF YORE, THIS POLICY </p><p>PAID FINANCIAL DIVIDENDS AS "UKAZ" GRABBED MARKET SHARE </p><p>AND INCREASED ITS CIRCULATION VIS-A-VIS OTHER SAUDI </p><p>DAILIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  "AL-RIYADH" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED </p><p>CIRCULATION: 100,000-120,000).  SISTER PAPER OF THE </p><p>ENGLISH "RIYADH DAILY."  FOUNDED IN 1964, "AL-RIYADH" AND </p><p>"AL-JAZIRA" COMPETE FIERCELY FOR INFLUENCE IN NAJD AND </p><p>EACH CLAIM TO BE A LARGER AND MORE INFLUENTIAL PAPER THAN </p><p>THE OTHER.  (WE GIVE THE EDGE TO "AL-RIYADH" BY A SLIM </p><p>MARGIN.)  COMPARATIVELY PROGRESSIVE FOR A SAUDI </p><p>NEWSPAPER, "AL-RIYADH" WAS THE FIRST SAUDI NEWSPAPER TO </p><p>OPEN A WOMEN\'S BUREAU.  ITS LITERARY PAGE IS DEEMED TO BE </p><p>BY FAR THE BEST IN THE KINGDOM.  ITS EDITOR, TURKI </p><p>AL-SUDAIRI, IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS ONE OF SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S BEST WRITERS AND ENJOYS A MEASURE OF </p><p>ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT RESPECTABILITY HAVING ONCE BEEN BANNED </p><p>FROM WRITING DUE TO A PARTICULARLY BITING DENUNCIATION HE </p><p>WROTE OF THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION IN THE MID-EIGHTIES, </p><p>THOUGH SUDAIRI IS FIRMLY IN THE CAMP OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>LOYALISTS.  USIS RELATIONS WITH THIS PAPER, ALTHOUGH </p><p>CORRECT, HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE.  DESPITE OUR BEST </p><p>EFFORTS, WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET "AL-RIYADH" AS </p><p>INVOLVED IN USIS PROGRAMMING AS OTHER PAPERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  "AL-JAZIRA" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED </p><p>CIRCULATION: 95,000-110,000).  FOUNDED IN 1963 AND SISTER </p><p>PAPER OF "AL-MASA\'IYA."  AS NOTED ABOVE, "AL-JAZIRA" AND </p><p>"AL-RIYADH" COMPETE FIERCELY AGAINST EACH OTHER.  USIS </p><p>RIYADH ENJOYS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PAPER THAN </p><p>ANY OTHER.  (IN 1986, THE PAPER COYLY SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>QADDAFI MAY HAVE GOTTEN WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM WHEN THE </p><p>U.S. BOMBED LIBYA IN 1986 IN COMPARISON WITH THE </p><p>UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE REACTIONS OF OTHER SAUDI PAPERS). </p><p>MANAGING EDITOR, JASER AL-JASER, WRITES THE ONLY DAILY </p><p>EDITORIAL DEVOTED TO POLITICAL COMMENTARY IN THE KINGDOM </p><p>AND IS WIDELY FOLLOWED, ALTHOUGH, IN THE VOLUME OF HIS </p><p>PRODUCTION, QUALITY SOMETIMES SUFFERS.  (AL-SUDAIRI AT </p><p>"AL-RIYADH," BY CONTRAST, PRODUCES ONLY A WEEKLY COLUMN). </p><p> </p><p>7.  "AL-MADINA" (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, MORE </p><p>RELIGIOUS THAN OTHER SAUDI PAPERS, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: </p><p>75,000-80,000).  FOUNDED IN MADINA IN 1936, "AL-MADINA" </p><p>IS SAUDI ARABIA\'S OLDEST PAPER.  IN THE EARLY 1980S, THE </p><p>PAPER LED "UKAZ" IN CIRCULATION, BUT HAS BADLY STUMBLED </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS ALLOWING "UKAZ" TO ESTABLISH A COMMANDING </p><p>LEAD IN THE HIJAZI MEDIA MARKET.  THE PAPER IS THOUGHT TO </p><p>BE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  "AL-YOM" (DAMMAM-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED </p><p>CIRCULATION: 75,000-90,000).  THE PAPER ENJOYED A </p><p>REPUTATION IN LATE 1970S AS A PAPER OF MILD NASSERIST </p><p>SYMPATHIES LEADING TO A CRACKDOWN IN 1981-1982 WHICH </p><p>RESULTED IN THE DISMISSALS OF SEVERAL JOURNALISTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE PAPER\'S CHIEF EDITOR.  UNDER NEW EDITORSHIP </p><p>AND WITH NO POLITICAL AXES TO GRIND, "AL-YOM" MAKES NO </p><p>PRETENSIONS TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LOCAL PAPER </p><p>CATERING TO EASTERN PROVINCE AUDIENCES, ALSO CIRCULATED </p><p>IN BAHRAIN, QATAR, AND ABU DHABI.  IN THE EARLY 1980S, </p><p>THE PAPER DREAMED OF ESTABLISHING AN ENGLISH EDITION, BUT </p><p>THESE PLANS SEEM FIRMLY SHELVED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  "AN-NADWA"  (MAKKAH-BASED, RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE, </p><p>ESTIMATED CIRCULATION OF 25,000-30,000).  "AN-NADWA\'S" </p><p>SMALL CIRCULATION MASKS THE IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF </p><p>THIS PAPER WHICH IS A REDOUBT OF RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>OPINION IN THE KINGDOM.  THE PAPER\'S EDITOR, YUSUF </p><p>DAMANHOURY, IS ONE OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S MOST RESPECTED </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND ENJOYS A REPUTATION AS AN EDITOR WILLING </p><p>TO TAKE RISKS AND MAKE PRINCIPALLED STANDS.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>"AL-NADWA" WAS THE ONLY SAUDI PAPER WHICH CONDEMNED THE </p><p>IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT BEFORE THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT </p><p>ADOPTED AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE ISSUE.  THE PAPER </p><p>ALSO USED TO BE KNOWN FOR ITS STRONG SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE, AN EDITORIAL LINE FREQUENTLY </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN STAFFERS AT </p><p>THE PAPER.  RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE PAPER HAS SWITCHED 180 </p><p>DEGREES ON ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PLO AND HAS BEEN THE MOST </p><p>OUTSPOKEN OF SAUDI PAPERS IN CRITICIZING ARAFAT\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP, INCLUDING CARRYING EDITORIALS CALLING ON </p><p>ARAFAT TO STEP DOWN AND QUESTIONING WHETHER THE PLO IS </p><p>INDEED THE "SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE" OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  SEVERAL STAFFERS AT THE PAPER ARE </p><p>ALSO EMPLOYED BY THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE.  THE PAPER\'S </p><p>LOCATION IN MAKKAH INHIBITS USIS CONTACTS WITH THE PAPER </p><p>DUE TO THE INABILITY OF NON-MUSLIMS TO TRAVEL TO THE HOLY </p><p>CITY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CONTACT WITH ITS CORRESPONDENTS IN </p><p>RIYADH AND JEDDAH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  "AL-BILAAD"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 25,000-30,000).  FOUNDED IN 1959, </p><p>IT IS GENERALLY AGREED TO BE ONE OF THE WEAKEST OF SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S DAILIES.  ITS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD IS AMIN </p><p>ABDULLAH KARKORI, WHO, ALONG WITH A CADRE OF BUSINESSMEN </p><p>AND LOCAL WRITERS, ARE THE MAINSTAYS OF THE PAPER\'S </p><p>EDITORIAL STAFF.  THE PAPER EMPLOYS FEW REPORTERS AND </p><p>RELIES HEAVILY ON WIRE SERVICES FOR ITS NEWS COVERAGE. </p><p>EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ABDUL AZIZ NAHARI IS A UNIVERSITY </p><p>LECTURER WITH M.A. AND PH.D. DEGREES FROM THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THE PAPER IS PROBABLY NOT A MONEY-MAKER. </p><p> </p><p>11.  "ARAB NEWS"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, YET </p><p>LIBERAL IN THE SAUDI CONTEXT, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: </p><p>75,000-80,000.  ALSO PUBLISHED IN CAIRO).  SISTER PAPER </p><p>OF "AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT" AND FOUNDED IN 1975.  BY FAR, THE </p><p>MOST PROFESSIONAL OF THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PAPERS IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA.  ITS EDITOR, KHALID AL-MAENNA, IS WELL-KNOWN IN </p><p>JEDDAH FOR HIS SENTIMENTS FAVORING GREATER POLITICAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN SAUDI ARABIA AND, IN NOVEMBER 1990, </p><p>OPENLY ADMITS TO HAVING TESTED THE ACCEPTED BOUNDARIES OF </p><p>SAUDI PRESS CENSORSHIP BY CARRYING STORIES ON THE ROLE OF </p><p>WOMEN IN SAUDI SOCIETY AND HIGHLIGHTING COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>PROCLAIMED KUWAITI COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  SAUDI </p><p>AUTHORITIES WERE REPORTEDLY NOT AMUSED, TOLD AL-MAENNA TO </p><p>STOP FLIRTING WITH THE REGULATIONS, AND AL-MAENNA HAS </p><p>RELUCTANTLY COMPLIED.  THE PAPER HAS SEVERAL WESTERN </p><p>REPORTERS ON ITS STAFF TO ENSURE THAT EDITORIAL COPY </p><p>REFLECTS PREVAILING ENGLISH SPELLING AND GRAMMAR. </p><p> </p><p>12.  "SAUDI GAZETTE"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 25,000-35,000).  SISTER PAPER OF </p><p>"UKAZ." FOUNDED IN 1976, THE "SAUDI GAZETTE," WAS PERHAPS </p><p>THE MOST ANTI-U.S. OF SAUDI PAPERS PRIOR TO DESERT </p><p>SHIELD/STORM AND OCCASSIONALLY IS STILL SNIDE ABOUT U.S. </p><p>POLICIES IN THE REGION.  ITS FLAMBOYANT EDITOR IS RIDAH </p><p>LARY, A SAUDI CITIZEN OF PERSIAN ORIGIN, NOTED FOR </p><p>WRITING SOME OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S LONGEST EDITORIALS WHICH </p><p>EVEN ARABS CONCEDE FREQUENTLY GO ON AND ON WITHOUT EVER </p><p>COMING TO THE POINT.  THE "SAUDI GAZETTE\'S" CHIEF </p><p>CARTOONIST, ABDEL RAHIM ALIREZA, HAS A THIRD GRADER\'S </p><p>TALENT FOR ART AND HAS A PARTICULARLY STRONG ANTI-U.S. </p><p>STREAK TO HIS CARTOONS WHOSE POINT IS FREQUENTLY </p><p>INCOMPREHENSIBLE.  (ONCE IN THE MID-1980S, A PARTICULARLY </p><p>PIQUED USIS PAO REFUSED TO INCLUDE "SAUDI GAZETTE" </p><p>EDITORIALS IN HIS USIS MEDIA REACTIONS STATING THAT HE </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE THEY WERE REFLECTIVE OF MAINSTREAM PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION IN SAUDI ARABIA.)  ALTHOUGH STILL SAUDI ARABIA\'S </p><p>SECOND LARGEST ENGLISH PAPER, THE NEWSPAPER HAS SUFFERED </p><p>QUALITATIVE DECLINES THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTIES AND </p><p>REPORTEDLY SUFFERS FROM DECLINING READERSHIP.  AS KHALID </p><p>AL-MAENNA, THE EDITOR OF THE COMPETING "ARAB NEWS" ONCE </p><p>REMARKED, "I HOPE RIDAH LARY STAYS EDITOR OF THE PAPER </p><p>FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS." </p><p> </p><p>13.  "RIYADH DAILY" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 15,000-25,000).  THE PAPER CLAIMS </p><p>ORIGINS IN THE MID-1970S WHEN IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A </p><p>FEW XEROXED SHEETS STAPLED TOGETHER, BUT BECAME A SERIOUS </p><p>NEWSPAPER IN 1985.  UNDER A NEW EDITOR, TALAAT WAFA (AN </p><p>M.A. HOLDER FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY AND A PH.D. </p><p>CANDIDATE AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY), THE PAPER HAS MADE </p><p>MAJOR QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS AND IS QUICKLY CATCHING UP </p><p>ON THE "SAUDI GAZETTE" IN TERMS OF CIRCULATION.  WAFA HAS </p><p>INVESTED HEAVILY IN THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND USE OF </p><p>COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE PAPER WHICH REPORTEDLY STILL </p><p>MAKES PUBLICATION UNPROFITABLE, BUT THE PAPER\'S </p><p>MANAGEMENT SEEMS COMMITTED TO STRIVING AGGRESSIVELY TO </p><p>COMPETE IN THE CROWDED SAUDI MARKET FOR ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  "AL-DHAHIRA"  (LONDON-BASED, SISTER PUBLICATION OF </p><p>"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT", CIRCULATION IN THE LOW THOUSANDS). </p><p>"AL-DHAHIRA" WAS BROUGHT OUT AS AN AFTERNOON PAPER BY THE </p><p>SAUDI RESEARCH AND MARKETING COMPANY (PUBLISHERS OF </p><p>"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT" AND "ARAB NEWS") IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR </p><p>NEWS THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD.  THE PAPER DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>EDITORIAL CONTENT AND LIMITS ITSELF TO PUBLISHING UP TO </p><p>THE MINUTE WIRE SERVICE REPORTS ON REGIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLICATION IN THE WAKE </p><p>OF THE GULF WAR IS UNCLEAR, BUT ITS CIRCULATION IS </p><p>CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT PURCHASES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  "AL-MASA\'IYA"  (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, </p><p>RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION OF </p><p>25,000-35,000).  SISTER PAPER OF "AL-JAZIRA."  OPENED IN </p><p>1982 AS SAUDI ARABIA\'S ONLY AFTERNOON NEWSPAPER.  IN </p><p>1983, CAME UNDER HEAVY FIRE FROM RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>AFTER PUBLISHING ARTICLES WHICH RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES </p><p>FELT MOCKED ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS VALUES.  TO AVOID CLOSURE, </p><p>THE PAPER APPOINTED A NEW EDITOR FROM RIYADH\'S </p><p>ULTRACONSERVATIVE IMAM MUHHAMAD UNIVERSITY WHO HAS SHOWN </p><p>LITTLE DIRECTION IN LEADING THE PAPER ANYWHERE.  THE </p><p>PAPER IS REPORTEDLY IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN LIGHT OF </p><p>COMPETITION FROM "AL-DHAHIRA" FOR A DECLINING </p><p>AFTERNOON/EVENING READERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>16.  COMMENT.  FOR A COUNTRY WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF </p><p>ROUGHLY TWELVE MILLION (SEVEN OR EIGHT MILLION OF WHOM </p><p>ARE SAUDIS, THE REMAINDER ARE EXPATRIATES RUNNING THE </p><p>GAMUT FROM SOPHISTICATED WESTERN TECHNOCRATS TO </p><p>IMPOVERISHED ASIAN SWEEPERS), SAUDI ARABIA HAS AN </p><p>UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF DAILY NEWSPAPERS.  THESE DOZEN </p><p>PAPERS PROVIDE A LARGE VOLUME OF EDITORIALS AND NEWS </p><p>ANALYSES FOR USIS MEDIA REACTIONS, BUT RARELY IS THERE </p><p>ANY PROVOCATIVE DEVIATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT\'S PERCEIVED </p><p>VIEWS ON DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES.  IN COMPARISON </p><p>WITH OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES, THE SAUDI PRESS (BOTH IN THE </p><p>ENGLISH, AND TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT, IN THE ARABIC </p><p>PRESS) DEVOTES LARGE VOLUMES OF NEWSPRINT TO PROMOTING </p><p>ISLAMIC PRACTICES AND PIETIES, AS A CONSTANT REINFORCER </p><p>OF THE "CORRECTNESS" OF THE SAUDI VIEW OF ISLAM.  (SUCH </p><p>WRITINGS PROBABLY ATTRACT MORE READERS TO THE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE PRESS THAN ANY COVERAGE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EVENTS.)  WHILE THE NUMBER OF PAPERS AND JOURNALISTS </p><p>CERTAINLY MERITS STRONG USIS ATTENTION, THE SAUDI PRESS </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, LIKE THE REST OF THE KINGDOM\'S MODERN </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE (SLEEK SUPERHIGHWAYS, L.A.-STYLE </p><p>HIGHRISES, AND 21ST CENTURY AIRPORTS), HAS AN AIR OF </p><p>GIANTISM AND UNREALITY ABOUT IT.  SUPERFICIALLY, THE </p><p>SAUDI PRESS IS IMPRESSIVE AND GLITZY WITH ACCESS TO ALL </p><p>OF THE WORLD\'S MEDIA SOURCES AND THE LATEST AND MOST </p><p>TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, YET </p><p>WITHIN IT THERE IS A CERTAIN HOLLOWNESS AS EGYPTIAN AND </p><p>SUDANESE EXPATRIATES TOIL TO ASSEMBLE THIS NUMERICALLY </p><p>LARGE, BUT UNPROVOCATIVE, ARRAY OF DAILY PRESS </p><p>PUBLICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  MINIMIZES CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GILBERT </p><p></p></div>
