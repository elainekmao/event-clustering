CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p></p><p>2.  INR\'S FEBRUARY 28 ASSESSMENT ENTITLED SOUTH AFRICA: </p><p>CHALLENGES FACING MBEKI" IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR </p><p>INFORMATION AND COMMENT, AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p></p><p>3.  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT MANDELA\'S FEBRUARY 15 </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEEK A SECOND TERM IN </p><p>OFFICE HAS MADE DEPUTY PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEXT </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR 1999.  GROWING RIFTS </p><p>WITHIN THE ANC WILL INCREASINGLY TEST MBEKI\'S LEADERSHIP. </p><p></p><p>4.  ONE MAJOR RIFT IS BETWEEN THE CURRENTLY PREVAILING </p><p>MODERATES, LED BY MANDELA AND MBEKI, AND PARTY </p><p>MILITANTS.  BUT AS ANC SUPPORTERS BECOME INCREASING </p><p>FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW PACE OF REFORM, THE ANC IS </p><p>COMING UNDER GROWING PRESSURE TO RADICALIZE ITS </p><p>POLICIES, AND THE MILITANT RHETORIC OF A GROUP OF RISING </p><p>STARS, INCLUDING WINNIE MANDELA, IS GAINING POPULARITY. </p><p>ANOTHER SCHISM LIES BETWEEN THE SUPPORTERS OF MBEKI AND </p><p>THOSE OF ANC SECRETARY-GENERAL CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, WHO IS </p><p>MBEKI\'S STRONGEST COMPETITOR FOR SOUTH AFRICA\'S TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP POSITION. </p><p></p><p>5.  THE POPULIST APPEAL.  BESIDES WINNIE MANDELA, THE </p><p>ANC\'S "POPULIST" GROUPING INCLUDES THREE OTHER PARTY </p><p>LEADERS WHOSE STATURE IN THE ANC IS NOT ACCURATELY </p><p>REFLECTED BY THEIR CURRENT TITLES.  THEY ARE PETER </p><p>MOKABA, PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON TOURISM CHAIRPERSON; </p><p>BANTU HOLOMISA, DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS </p><p>AND TOURISM; AND ROCKY MALEBANE-METSING, SPECIAL ADVISER </p><p>TO THE NORTHWEST PROVINCE.  WITH THEIR OUTSPOKEN </p><p>MILITANCY AND ADVOCACY OF RADICAL REDISTRIBUTION, THE </p><p>FOUR HAVE ATTRACTED A LARGE FOLLOWING AMONG THE ANC\'S </p><p>POOREST CONSTITUENCIES--SQUATTERS, RURAL DWELLERS, THE </p><p>URBAN UNEMPLOYED, AND MARGINALIZED YOUTH.  THEIR APPEAL </p><p>IS BROADENING DESPITE THE EMBROILMENT OF EACH IN WIDELY </p><p>PUBLICIZED SCANDALS. </p><p></p><p>6.  MRS. MANDELA, THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF THE FOUR, </p><p>WAS CONVICTED IN 1993 OF KIDNAPPING AND ASSAULT, AND, </p><p>ALONG WITH MOKABA AND MALEBANE-METSING, HAS FACED </p><p>REPEATED CHARGES OF FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT.  HOLOMISA\'S </p><p>DICTATORIAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE FORMER TRANSKEI </p><p>HOMELAND HAS COME UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY.  EVEN SO, AT THE </p><p>ANC\'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE LAST DECEMBER, HOLOMISA, </p><p>MOKABA AND MRS. MANDELA WERE NOMINATED FIRST, THIRD AND </p><p>FIFTH RESPECTIVELY FOR POSITIONS ON THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  THE ANC\'S POPULISTS ARE BUILDING A </p><p>POWERFUL BASE OF SUPPORT THAT COULD, ONCE MANDELA STEPS </p><p>DOWN, PLACE THEM IN A POSITION TO WIELD SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INFLUENCE WITHIN THE PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p>7.  AN UNEASY ALLIANCE.  MANDELA AND MBEKI CAN ILL </p><p>AFFORD TO DISMISS THE POPULISTS\' WIDE APPEAL--MRS. </p><p>MANDELA ALONE HAS THE SUPPORT OF PERHAPS 40 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE ANC\'S CONSTITUENTS.  FOR HIS PART, MBEKI, WHOSE LONG </p><p>YEARS IN EXILE LEFT HIM ISOLATED AND LARGELY UNKNOWN TO </p><p>THE BLACK POPULATION, HAS ALLIED HIMSELF TO THE </p><p>POPULISTS, DESPITE FUNDAMENTAL IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, </p><p>TO GAIN POPULAR SUPPORT.  HIS STRATEGY HAS LARGELY PAID </p><p>OFF, AND HE NOW ENJOYS THE WIDE ACCEPTANCE HE NEEDS AS </p><p>MANDELA\'S HEIR APPARENT.  IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, </p><p>MBEKI WILL COME UNDER GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE POPULISTS, </p><p>WHOSE RISE IN THE GOVERNMENT MBEKI HAS FACILITATED, TO </p><p>APPOINT THEM TO SENIOR CABINET POSTS, IN WHICH THEY WILL </p><p>BE EVEN BETTER PLACED TO RADICALIZE ANC POLICIES. </p><p></p><p>8.  RAMAPHOSA STILL STRONG.  MBEKI\'S ALLIANCES WITH THE </p><p>POPULISTS HAVE GIVEN HIM THE EDGE OVER RAMAPHOSA, WHO </p><p>BOWED OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR DEPUTY PRESIDENT AT THE </p><p>LAST MINUTE, KNOWING THAT A MAJORITY OF ANC NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SUPPORT MBEKI.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>RAMAPHOSA, WHO RUNS THE PARTY ORGANIZATION AND IS A </p><p>MAJOR PLAYER IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, REMAINS </p><p>HIGHLY RESPECTED AMONG THE ANC SENIOR RANKS AND IS </p><p>LIKELY TO CHALLENGE MBEKI FOR THE ANC\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>NOMINATION IN THE NEXT ELECTION. </p><p></p><p>9.  RAMAPHOSA WOULD BE A FORMIDABLE RIVAL:  A PROMINENT </p><p>LABOR LEADER DURING THE APARTHEID ERA, HE TRADITIONALLY </p><p>HAS FAR GREATER SUPPORT THAN MBEKI AMONG GRASSROOTS ANC </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
