<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICE DISRUPT PUBLIC CELEBRATION OF TIBETAN </p><p>DEMOCRACY DAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On September 2 local police halted the Tibetan </p><p>community\'s religious celebration of Tibet\'s "Democracy Day" </p><p>and detained Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering </p><p>and another man for several hours.  The celebration, which </p><p>had been originally scheduled to be held on the grounds of </p><p>the Boudhanath Stupa, was ultimately allowed to resume within </p><p>the confines of the monastery--but without the presence of </p><p>the Office of Tibet Representative. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Tsering told emboff he had applied for permission </p><p>from local police to hold the "puja," or religious </p><p>celebration, and had encountered no objection.  On the </p><p>morning of the celebration, however, he reported 30-40 police </p><p>were awaiting the celebrants on the grounds of Boudhanath. He </p><p>was asked to accompany police to the local station, where the </p><p>ranking officer explained he had been directed by the Home </p><p>Ministry to halt the proceedings and to keep Tsering at </p><p>headquarters till sundown.  A Tibetan man who had been </p><p>handing out pamphlets on the grounds of the stupa was also </p><p>detained.  Tsering said he tried to persuade the local </p><p>authorities that the celebration was religious, rather than </p><p>political, and to remind them that the Tibetan community had </p><p>marked the same occasion in previous years without </p><p>interruption.  He was not successful, and was forced to stay </p><p>at the police station, drinking tea, making phone calls, and </p><p>chatting with police, until he was released at 4:00 p.m. the </p><p>same day, along with the pamphleteer. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The lapse of a state of emergency August </p><p>28 lifted a ban on public assemblies.  Tsering speculated </p><p>pressure from the Chinese may have influenced the Home </p><p>Ministry\'s decision to stop the public </p><p>celebration--especially since it was allowed to continue </p><p>inside the monastery.  The Embassy will raise this apparently </p><p>arbitrary suppression of the right to free assembly with the </p><p>Home Ministry and other Government officials. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
