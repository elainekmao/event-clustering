<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/ARN AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR THEROUX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KPAL, KWBG, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE REACTION TO AQABA AND SHARM </p><p>SUMMITS A MIXTURE OF HOPE AND </p><p>SKEPTICISM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 2611 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: UAE reaction to last week\'s summits in </p><p>Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba has been a mixture of </p><p>appreciation for the President\'s personal engagement, </p><p>skepticism about Sharon\'s ultimate commitment to a peaceful </p><p>solution and fear for Abu Mazen\'s political future and </p><p>physical safety.  The press has criticized Hamas\' decision </p><p>to continue the armed struggle and expressed fears over the </p><p>outbreak of a Palestinian civil war.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid telephoned the </p><p>Ambassador over the local weekend with his own assessment </p><p>of the Aqaba summit.  While he felt that the statements </p><p>issued by the four leaders were encouraging, Hamdan remains </p><p>worried about actual implementation of the roadmap and the </p><p>many Israeli reservations.  Hamdan reported that the </p><p>Emirati leadership believes Abu Mazen said all the right </p><p>things but fears that he will be further weakened in </p><p>Palestinian circles if he does not get some kind of </p><p>substantive response from the Israelis.  (Comment:  The 6/8 </p><p>joint attacks on Israeli soldiers have no doubt further fed </p><p>fears of Abu Mazen\'s marginalization and inability to stem </p><p>future attacks.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Former UAE Oil Minister Mana\'a Saeed Al-Otaiba, in a </p><p>June 7 meeting with the Ambassador (other topics covered </p><p>septel), expressed his trepidation about Abu Mazen\'s </p><p>safety.  Al-Otaiba, noting that Abu Mazen was a close </p><p>personal friend and that Abu Mazen\'s elder brother had been </p><p>his primary school teacher in Qatar in the late 1950s/early </p><p>1960s, recalled a recent private meeting with Abu Mazen in </p><p>Morocco.  In Al-Otaiba\'s view, Abu Mazen was faced with a </p><p>very daunting task, governing a people who were difficult </p><p>to manage in the best of times, with limited resources and </p><p>absent the basic tools with which to maintain security. </p><p>Al-Otaiba was not surprised by Abu Mazen\'s decision not to </p><p>take back Palestinian territory until he could adequately </p><p>control the security situation.  Shaykh Hamdan had raised </p><p>this point in an earlier conversation with the Ambassador </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The UAE press also took a pragmatic approach toward </p><p>the Aqaba and Sharm summits.  The English daily Gulf Today </p><p>opined that "the spate of pledges by the participants of </p><p>the Aqaba summit should have raised waves of hope all </p><p>around the Red Sea had it been made under more realistic </p><p>circumstances.  But neither Palestinian Prime Minister </p><p>Mahmoud Abbas nor Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would </p><p>swear on what they pledged in the presence of U.S. </p><p>President George W. Bush, now in the role of a peacemaker." </p><p>The paper\'s editorial went on to note that "it would be </p><p>naive to believe that Sharon would get the approval from </p><p>his extreme right wing colleagues for dismantling </p><p>settlements."  The English daily Gulf News feared that "the </p><p>sudden announcement by Hamas to break off talks with the </p><p>Palestinian National Authority (PNA) could give rise to a </p><p>Palestinian civil war that will undermine the roadmap and </p><p>detract Palestinians from their goal of regaining their </p><p>national rights." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
