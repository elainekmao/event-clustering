<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000339 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR CLAUDE BURCKY </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC ASSURANCES ON TRIPS AND MEDICINES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 26895 </p><p> </p><p>     B. DICKSON-LAITINEN 1/31 EMAIL </p><p>     C. OTTAWA 156 </p><p>     D. OTTAWA 007 </p><p> </p><p>1. Econoff discussed the latest evolution in GOC thinking on </p><p>TRIPS and medicines with Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade IPR Director Catherine Dickson on January </p><p>30.  Dickson reaffirmed the assurances given by Trade </p><p>Minister Pettigrew in his January 10 phone conversation with </p><p>USTR Zoellick and the position announced by the Canadian </p><p>delegation at the January 28 informal TRIPS Council meeting. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Canada remains disappointed that the TRIPS Council did </p><p>not resolve the issue by the December 2002 deadline, but </p><p>shares the USG commitment to finding a long-term, </p><p>multilateral solution to the problem.  In the meantime, said </p><p>Dickson, the GOC will not take dispute settlement action </p><p>against any poor country that needs access to medicines to </p><p>treat a public health crisis (e.g., HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, </p><p>malaria) but has limited or no manufacturing capablity. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dickson underscored the Canadian position in writing via </p><p>Ref B, which she copied to USTR\'s Claude Burcky. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
