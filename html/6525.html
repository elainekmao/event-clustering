<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SECOND DAY OF MDC STAYAWAY A MAJOR SUCCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 557 B) HARARE 546 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>ALMOST UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Approximately 80-90 percent of private urban </p><p>businesses were closed nationwide on March 19, the second day </p><p>of the national stayaway organized by the opposition MDC.  In </p><p>Harare, more than 90 percent of retail shops in the central </p><p>business district were shuttered (significantly more than the </p><p>50 percent the day before), with 60 percent of the normally </p><p>full parking spaces available.  A 15-minute drive-around by </p><p>polchief in the industrial areas revealed only one business </p><p>open, and that one appeared to be operating at minimal </p><p>capacity.  In the northern, low-density suburbs where most </p><p>Embassy families reside, most shops were closed.  Most of the </p><p>high-density suburbs around Harare were quiet today and </p><p>public transportation from those areas into central Harare </p><p>was largely unavailable.  More than 40 percent of U.S. </p><p>Mission FSN\'s (78/185) were not at work today and many of </p><p>those who did appear left soon after noon, hoping the early </p><p>departure would give them a head-start in securing scarce </p><p>transport home. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The stayaway gained momentum on the second day, when </p><p>many more businesses around the country shut their doors.  In </p><p>Bulawayo, Zimbabwe\'s second-largest city, the central </p><p>business district was very quiet, as 80-90 percent of shops </p><p>were closed.  Pedestrian and vehicular traffic was very light </p><p>in downtown Bulawayo, and very few commuter omnibuses were </p><p>operating.  Approximately half of businesses in the </p><p>industrial area were again open, with most of those operating </p><p>at minimal capacity.  In the southern city of Masvingo, </p><p>virtually every shop was closed, according to Mayor Alois </p><p>Chaimiti.  Some 90 percent of private businesses in the </p><p>eastern city of Mutare were shut, an impressive increase over </p><p>the 30 percent of the day before.  MDC advisor Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa, one of the key organizers of the stayaway, was </p><p>pleased with the results on day two.  He claimed that more </p><p>than 80 percent of businesses were closed in every major </p><p>urban center in Zimbabwe except Gweru, where he said MDC </p><p>structures were "not well-grounded." </p><p> </p><p>Relatively Little Violence </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) There were reports of violence the evening of March </p><p>18 in the high-density suburbs of Kuwadzana, Dzivaresekwa, </p><p>and Chitungwiza, involving both battles between rival groups </p><p>of youths (in Kuwadzana) and beatings administered by police </p><p>(in Dzivaresekwa and Chitungwiza).  We heard unconfirmed </p><p>reports of isolated incidents of stoning of cars and </p><p>intimidation of those trying to get to work the morning of </p><p>March 19. </p><p> </p><p>Sympathy from security services? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A drive by emboffs through downtown Harare and </p><p>several high-density suburbs (Tafara, Epworth, Warren Park, </p><p>and Kuwadzana) revealed virtually no overt police presence. </p><p>We understand from some sources that police concentrated </p><p>their attention today on the high-density areas of Glenview, </p><p>Budiriro, and Chitungwiza.  A military helicopter made a </p><p>number of flights over Harare, with teargas canisters clearly </p><p>visible underneath.  MDC advisor Mudzingwa told us he was </p><p>encouraged by two specific incidents on March 18 which he </p><p>interpreted as sympathy for the MDC efforts by security force </p><p>elements.  In the first instance, Mudzingwa claimed that the </p><p>burning of a bus in Chitungwiza was instigated by police. </p><p>The police officers apparently approached a group of MDC </p><p>youths, said they were fed up with what was happening in </p><p>Zimbabwe, and promised not to arrest them if they burned a </p><p>bus.  Although wary at first, the youths proceeded to torch a </p><p>bus, then ran away as the police officers stood by </p><p>motionlessly.    Then, in Chitungwiza the evening of March </p><p>18, soldiers made no attempt to stop MDC youths from burning </p><p>another bus or to subsequently detain them. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The two-day stayaway was a major success for the </p><p>MDC, which demonstrated its capacity to mobilize widespread </p><p>support and paralyze Zimbabwe\'s economy.  The party </p><p>leadership decided against prolonging the stayaway out of </p><p>concern for the effort\'s sustainability beyond the announced </p><p>two days.  We think this was a correct decision, particularly </p><p>if the party was uncertain about the prospects for success, </p><p>as the MDC can now declare victory and deploy a useful </p><p>bargaining chip in its efforts to forge a sustainable </p><p>resolution of Zimbabwe\'s political crisis.  The opposition </p><p>party must now find a way to build constructively on the </p><p>political momentum of the last two days, including mobilizing </p><p>the urban population to move from passive resistance to more </p><p>activist, peaceful protest against the Mugabe regime. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
