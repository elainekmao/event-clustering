<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W, PRM AND DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  DECLARATION OF DISASTER: DISPLACEMENT OF ITSEKIRI </p><p>AND IJAW VILLAGERS IN WARRI AREA, DELTA STATE </p><p> </p><p>1. The Ambassador hereby declares the situation in the </p><p>Warri North, Warri South, and Warri Southwest Local </p><p>Government Areas (LGAs) of Delta State as a man-made </p><p>disaster.  In accordance with USAID/DCHA Office of U.S. </p><p>Foreign Disaster Assistance guidance, the Ambassador </p><p>requests immediate OFDA support of $50,000 in order to </p><p>provided emergency humanitarian relief assistance to the </p><p>approximately 9,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in </p><p>this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The affected LGAs are located in the Niger Delta, a </p><p>region of the country that accounts for around 90 percent </p><p>of Nigeria\'s export earnings and 80 percent of the </p><p>government\'s revenue, but which remains one of the least </p><p>developed regions in Nigeria with per capita income well </p><p>below the national average of $280.  This disparity has </p><p>contributed to a regular cycle of conflict in this oil- </p><p>producing region over the past several years.  However, </p><p>this is the first time that the conflict has been so severe </p><p>in its impact on the oil flows to the world market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The current conflict between two major ethnic groups in </p><p>the region, the Ijaws and the Itsekiri, was ostensibly </p><p>provoked by the Ijaws\' grievance over a recently redrawn </p><p>division of electoral wards in the Warri Southwest LGA. </p><p>The Ijaws are the fourth largest ethnic group in Nigeria </p><p>and the new division has been perceived as giving rival </p><p>Itsekiri political dominance over an area heavily populated </p><p>by Ijaws.  Fighting between the Nigerian military and Ijaw </p><p>youth over illegal "bunkering" (theft by siphoning) of oil </p><p>from pipelines is also seen as a contributing factor. </p><p>Regardless of the true source of the conflict, starting on </p><p>March 13, Ijaw youth attacked and razed 28 Itsekiri </p><p>villages.  In response, the Nigerian Navy and Army fired on </p><p>Ijaw villages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. According to the International Foundation for Education </p><p>and Self-Help (IFESH) -- a U.S. NGO with office, staff and </p><p>projects in Warri and the surrounding area -- the conflict </p><p>has left approximately 8,000 Itsekiri IDPs living outdoors </p><p>in common areas in Warri town and Sapele (about 45 </p><p>kilometers north of Warri town) since mid-March: 2,500 of </p><p>the Itsekiri IDPs are currently in Warri town and 5,500 are </p><p>in Sapele.  An additional 1,000 ethnic Ijaw IDPs are also </p><p>living without shelter in Obe-Ijoh, the seat of Warri </p><p>Southwest LGA.  Itsekiri and Ijaw leaders generally confirm </p><p>these figures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. On March 20, in response to the severity of violence </p><p>associated with the conflict, both Chevron and Shell closed </p><p>down wells and flow stations in the area and evacuated </p><p>their personnel to Warri town, Port Harcourt and Lagos. </p><p>Shell and Chevron also assisted in the evacuation of </p><p>thousands of villagers displaced by the fighting.  The </p><p>resulting "shut-in" of oil production translated in the </p><p>lost production of approximately 800,000 barrels/day, equal </p><p>to more than one-percent of global demand and over 40 </p><p>percent of Nigeria\'s production.  Lost revenue to both the </p><p>Nigerian government and the oil companies could exceed as </p><p>much as $1.5 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Because of a lack of resources and a deep distrust of </p><p>the government by the affected ethnic groups, the Federal </p><p>Government of Nigeria and the Delta State Government are </p><p>unable to fulfill the immediate humanitarian needs of these </p><p>IDPs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Federal Government (Office of the Presidency) has </p><p>been contacted formally and we anticipate shortly a </p><p>response indicating GON acceptance of this USG (OFDA) </p><p>disaster relief through a U.S. NGO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Providing relief to address the humanitarian needs of </p><p>those affected by this conflict is strongly in the USG\'s </p><p>interest.  The shut-down of oil production in this area </p><p>adversely affected global oil supplies and prices: as the </p><p>largest purchaser of Nigerian crude oil, the US is </p><p>particularly sensitive to fluctuations in Nigeria\'s oil </p><p>production.  The Niger Delta is also home to the largest </p><p>concentration of U.S. investment in continental Africa. </p><p>More generally, mitigating a humanitarian emergency in the </p><p>region will underscore U.S. concerns for the people of </p><p>Nigeria in this strategically critical area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Given, the lack of GON capacity to respond to the </p><p>situation, the willingness of Nigeria\'s Federal Government </p><p>to accept USG disaster relief through a U.S. NGO, and the </p><p>strategic importance of the region to the U.S., this </p><p>disaster relief request meets USAID/DCHA requirements for </p><p>funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Why IFESH? </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The Embassy proposes to use IFESH to respond to the </p><p>immediate needs of the IDPs because it is uniquely </p><p>positioned to provide this relief aid efficiently and </p><p>equitably.  IFESH is the only U.S. NGO operating in the </p><p>affected swamplands of Delta State.  It has earned the </p><p>respect of both Ijaw and Itsekiri communities -- no easy </p><p>feat in this conflict-plagued land -- implementing </p><p>community development and conflict resolution activities </p><p>with USAID and Chevron support.  IFESH, founded by the late </p><p>Reverend Leon Sullivan, is also well known to USAID </p><p>throughout the world.  Equally important, the Nigerian Red </p><p>Cross -- the usual vehicle for delivery of disaster relief </p><p>here -- is in our view unsuitable for the efficient and </p><p>equitable disbursement of relief aid in this region.  A </p><p>prominent Itsekiri leader recently told the Embassy that </p><p>her people would not trust the Red Cross because it is seen </p><p>as an arm of the government and relatively unknown to the </p><p>local communities.  This view was echoed by Warri staff of </p><p>IFESH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. According to an assessment provided by IFESH, an </p><p>estimated 4,000 of the IDPs are in immediate need of </p><p>bedding, clothing, food and counseling.  IFESH workers in </p><p>Warri claim that shelter material (e.g. tents or tarps) are </p><p>not/not needed as the IDPs feel vulnerable to attack in </p><p>these; the IDPs prefer and are using enclosed spaces such </p><p>as public schools and sheltered stadiums.  The projected </p><p>budget for this OFDA relief assistance is as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--500 sets of Bedding at Naira 4,000/set = $15,335 </p><p>--Food for 4,000 for 14 days at Naira 50/pp/pd = $23,077 </p><p>--4,000 sets of clothing at Naira 300/set = $9,230 </p><p>--Counseling at three sites = $2,092 </p><p>TOTAL:  $49,734. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Post will encourage Chevron, which already co-funds </p><p>IFESH projects in the Delta, to contribute to the relief </p><p>effort.  In addition to the airlift provided to 2,000 IDPs </p><p>from its operational compound, Chevron initially provided </p><p>some food relief to the displaced.  We will also encourage </p><p>Shell, though not a U.S. company, to provide similar </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. If OFDA approves this request for disaster assistance, </p><p>Post\'s USAID Mission would provide the funding directly to </p><p>the Nigeria office of IFESH for immediate procurement of </p><p>relief supplies on the local market.  IFESH certifies its </p><p>ability to find these items easily on the local market and </p><p>asserts its capacity to deliver them in a timely and </p><p>accountable manner to the desired IDP recipients.  Full </p><p>accounting and evaluation reports will be provided to the </p><p>USAID MDRO by IFESH after the relief delivery is completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Points of contact for this request are: 1) Post\'s </p><p>Mission Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO) Denise Rollins, at </p><p>office: (234-9) 234-2175 or 234-2189; home: (234-9) 413- </p><p>5740; cell phone: (234-803) 408-1034;  e-mail: </p><p>drollins@usaid.gov or denise_rollins@hotmail.com; and (2) </p><p>Post\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Mark Taylor </p><p>at 234-9-523-0916 or (cellphone) 234-80359-00448, email: </p><p>TaylorMB2@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
