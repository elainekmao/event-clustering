STATE 69669 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action cable; action for INL in para 16. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Timothy D. Andrews for reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Summary:  The Government of Nigeria turned over </p><p>fugitive Gabriel Etim Umoh to Embassy\'s LEGATT on June 8 and </p><p>he was flown out of the country, bound for Washington, via a </p><p>commercial flight that evening.  GON cooperation was </p><p>excellent.  The Attorney General oversaw the GON\'s side of </p><p>the process and personally intervened with prison authorities </p><p>to ensure Umoh was transferred to the LEGATT\'s custody in a </p><p>timely manner.  This success reflects the GON\'s commitment to </p><p>improved law enforcement cooperation with us.  We would like </p><p>to think it presages progress on our pending extradition </p><p>requests for at least 11 more fugitives, but our optimism </p><p>should be cautious.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) In response to formal USDOJ extradition papers </p><p>presented to the Ministry of Justice in early February, </p><p>Attorney General Kanu Agabi on April 10 ordered the start of </p><p>extradition proceedings for Umoh.  A U.S.-Nigeria dual </p><p>national, Umoh was convicted of mail fraud in the court </p><p>district of Central California and sentenced to 18 months </p><p>imprisonment followed by three years of probation.  Free on </p><p>bond, Umoh fled to Nigeria rather than reporting to prison. </p><p>In mid-April, Umoh\'s extradition proceedings opened in the </p><p>Lagos High Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Court proceedings ended on May 13 and the presiding </p><p>judge issued a favorable ruling on May 20.  The Director of </p><p>Public Prosecutions, Mrs. I.S. Omiyi, formally notified the </p><p>Embassy June 5 that an order transferring Umoh to the </p><p>Embassy\'s custody would be forthcoming within days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Mission elements worked on the assumption that the </p><p>extradition should proceed as quickly as possible.  LEGATT </p><p>Michael Bonner volunteered to escort Umoh to Washington on a </p><p>commercial flight and USSS Assistant Attache\' Frank Boudreau </p><p>agreed to be the second escort.  On June 7, the Embassy </p><p>responded to Omiyi\'s letter, stating that we were ready and </p><p>wanted to proceed with the transfer forthwith.    In a phone </p><p>call with RNLEO that afternoon, the AG agreed to sign the </p><p>order immediately.  He agreed to fly a MOJ official fly to </p><p>Lagos with the original copy of the order on the morning of </p><p>June 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prison Problems </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) On June 8, Omiyi, LEGATT, RNLEO, a Police/Interpol </p><p>Officer and the MOJ official who carried the AG\'s order from </p><p>Abuja went directly to the Prison in Lagos, where the group </p><p>found a recalcitrant Prison Supervisor who offered myriad </p><p>reasons for not turning over the fugitive -- ranging from the </p><p>inconvenient timing (the weekend) and lack of an explicit </p><p>court order, to uncertainty over the authenticity of the AG\'s </p><p>written order.  The Embassy officers remained silent during </p><p>this exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) RNLEO phoned the AG\'s personal assistant in Abuja (who </p><p>was in the AG\'s residence) and got the AG on the phone with </p><p>the DPP.  The AG then spoke with the Prison Superintendent, </p><p>who produced Umoh within 15 minutes.  (Note: The AG\'s Special </p><p>Assistant later disclosed to RNLEO that the AG had informed </p><p>the Prison Superintendent that if he didn\'t transfer Umoh the </p><p>AG would go to the President and have him fired.  The AG also </p><p>warned that anyone obstructing this lawful extradition would </p><p>be disciplined.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) According to the MOJ officials who were inside the </p><p>prison, when Umoh was informed he would be leaving for the </p><p>U.S., he attempted to forestall the extradition by claiming </p><p>that he had filed an appeal. The DPP reportedly noted that no </p><p>such appeal had been registered with the court.  Umoh then </p><p>stated that he planned to file the appeal when courts </p><p>reopened on Monday.  This did not impress the DPP and Umoh </p><p>was soon transferred to the custody of the Nigerian </p><p>Police(Interpol) officer and escorted to a temporary police </p><p>holding facility nearby.  Four hours later (7pm) LEGATT and </p><p>USSS Asst. Attache arrived in U.S. Mission vehicles with </p><p>Consulate security escorts and formally took Umoh into USG </p><p>custody.  RNLEO accompanied the group to the airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Departure Time </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) The U.S. Mission received excellent cooperation from </p><p>Nigerian authorities during the crucial transfer of Umoh to a </p><p>KLM flight at Lagos\' Murtala Muhammed International Airport. </p><p>RNLEO requested NDLEA assistance in providing security and a </p><p>secure area where Umoh could be held; NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji </p><p>obliged immediately.  The Federal Aviation Authority of </p><p>Nigeria\'s (FAAN) Chief of Security for the airport met the </p><p>arriving convoy at the diplomatic parking area and escorted </p><p>the party to the NDLEA hold area, allowing the US officials </p><p>and the fugitive to bypass the more congested arrival hall. </p><p>The FAAN official later escorted the travelers through a </p><p>direct route to the gate.  KLM also was very cooperative, </p><p>allowing for early boarding and selective seating. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) Umoh and his FBI/USSS escorts departed Lagos at </p><p>10:40pm on KLM flight 588 and, after pre-arranged assistance </p><p>from Dutch Immigration, the party connected to Northwest </p><p>Flight 35 that left Amsterdam on June 9 and arrived at </p><p>Washington/Dulles at 2:10pm.  At Dulles Airport, U.S. </p><p>Marshals took Umoh, escorting him to California. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Umoh\'s Case </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) Gabriel Umoh, a dual U.S./Nigerian national, had </p><p>plead guilty and was convicted of one charge of Mail Fraud in </p><p>the court of the Central District of California in November </p><p>1987.  Before beginning his prison sentence of 18 months and </p><p>3 years of probation, he violated bail and fled to Nigeria. </p><p>In November 1998 the USG requested Umoh\'s arrest but no </p><p>action was forthcoming.  In February 2001 Umoh and two </p><p>Nigerian narcotics fugitives were arrested by the Nigerian </p><p>police.  The GON planned to render these three fugitives to </p><p>US justice without formal extradition proceedings, similar to </p><p>the process used to render four fugitives in November 2000. </p><p>After the USG indicated the need for formal extradition </p><p>hearings, the police in April 2001 released them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) Through the Embassy, DOJ resubmitted full </p><p>documentation for Umoh\'s arrest and extradition in February </p><p>2002.  Umoh was rearrested shortly after the Attorney General </p><p>signed the official order to start extradition proceedings in </p><p>his case on April 8.  Those proceedings started one week </p><p>later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) According to the MOJ prosecutor presenting the </p><p>Ministry\'s case for Umoh\'s extradition before the Federal </p><p>High Court, the defense counsel attempted to argue that the </p><p>crime (mail fraud) was not covered under the U.S.-UK </p><p>Extradition treaty of 1931 or the 1967 Nigerian Extradition </p><p>Act.  This argument failed.  MOJ prosecutors are not entirely </p><p>sure why Umoh did not immediately appeal the judge\'s ruling, </p><p>but speculate that given the lack of any successful </p><p>extraditions in the past, Umoh\'s attorney may not have seen </p><p>the urgency in filing that appeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) Comment:  In any event, the attorney\'s failure to act </p><p>promptly, together with GON determination to help us move </p><p>swiftly, produced the first judicial extradition to the U.S. </p><p>from Nigeria in at least a decade -- perhaps longer.  This is </p><p>a major accomplishment, and we would like to think it bodes </p><p>well for our many other extradition requests.  However, we </p><p>need to temper our optimism.  Umoh\'s case was different from </p><p>most as he had already been convicted.  Also, Umoh may hot </p><p>have had the same resources available to him to corrupt </p><p>judicial proceedings that we believe other fugitives have </p><p>often employed. End Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kudos and Action Request </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) The new Attorney General moved our request for Umoh\'s </p><p>extradition through the judicial system at a remarkable pace. </p><p> According to his Special Assistant, Agabi expressed his </p><p>desire to erase Nigeria\'s poor image as a criminal haven. </p><p>This first extradition under the Obasanjo administration has </p><p>shown that the corruption-plagued Nigerian justice system can </p><p>work when pushed.  Umoh\'s  status as a convicted (vice </p><p>indicted) fugitive probably helped the public prosecutor\'s </p><p>case.  Umoh\'s extradition also benefited from an ideal level </p><p>of GON support -- from the Attorney General just a cell phone </p><p>call away to having the Director of Public Prosecutions </p><p>accompany LEGATT and RNLEO to the Prison.  The timing was </p><p>also perfect.  A late Friday order from the AG to the Prison </p><p>and the Police and an immediate Saturday departure preempted </p><p>a last minute appeal.  It was disappointing, but not </p><p>surprising given Nigeria\'s endemic corruption, that the AG </p><p>had to make explicit threats to get line officers to obey his </p><p>formal and written orders. </p><p>15.(C) During his transport to the United States, Umoh </p><p>confided to Legatt that the federal Prison Ikoyi was grossly </p><p>overcrowded and he paid N30,000 for a semi private jail cell </p><p>with a television set.  Umoh stated that he had planned to </p><p>file his appeal first thing Monday and the Prison Official </p><p>was aware of his plan.  Umoh stated that the official,s </p><p>reluctance to release him was a result of his knowledge that </p><p>Umoh was going to file the appeal.  Keeping Umoh in prison </p><p>was to the official,s advantage because he would continue to </p><p>receive payments from Umoh for his privilege of a </p><p>semi-private jail cell.  Umoh stated that the official </p><p>offered to get him released from prison for N800,000. </p><p>16.(SBU) Kudos for team work all around.  This success </p><p>reflects excellent teamwork on all sides.  We want to thank </p><p>Jason Carter and others in DOJ/OIA, Peter Prahar and Ed Flood </p><p>in INL, Steve Cutler and others at FBI Headquarters, Richard </p><p>Visek in L/LEI, Carl Cundiff and Dan Epstein in AF/W, and all </p><p>others in Washington who contributed to this extremely </p><p>short-fused coordination task -- all done by phone and e-mail </p><p>before we could get a cable out.  That great Washington </p><p>support was mirrored by teamwork at the U.S. Mission here, </p><p>from getting formal correspondence to the Nigerian Justice </p><p>Ministry to arranging security for the prisoner transfer and </p><p>a Consular Section travel letter for the passport-less </p><p>prisoner.  And, of course, we appreciate the efforts of some </p><p>terrific counterparts in the Nigerian Police and Ministry of </p><p>Justice who went beyond the call of duty to make sure this </p><p>happened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.(C) We will begin plans for the next extradition already </p><p>in train -- Daniel Orhiumu (ref D), also convicted of fraud. </p><p>Encouraged by our success with Umoh and with valuable lessons </p><p>learned in that process, we hope the Justice Ministry will </p><p>work with us in clearing the backlog of extradition requests, </p><p>while entertain new requests.  We would caution, however, </p><p>that Umoh\'s case may have been easier for the court to </p><p>process and, as the first extradition success, it had the </p><p>benefit of surprise -- other fugitives may be better prepared </p><p>to file quick appeals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.(SBU) Action Request for INL:  In light of this positive </p><p>development, we would like to set dates for the INL-funded </p><p>OPDAT extradition workshop in Abuja and involving US and </p><p>Nigerian MOJ prosecutors and Nigerian High Court judges.  We </p><p>would propose July or August as a general time-frame. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
