<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001705 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>STATE PLEASE ALSO PASS USTR - BRUCE LEVINE </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S PREPARATIONS FOR WTO WORKING PARTY MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 164046 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Upcoming general elections on November 13 do not </p><p>seem to have impeded preparations by the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) for its second Working Party meeting on accession to </p><p>the WTO September 12.  Accession to the WTO has broad, </p><p>multipartisan support, and the process is unlikely to be </p><p>negatively affected by a change in government.  GON </p><p>interlocutors have signaled some openness to considering </p><p>further revisions to the services offer.  The delegation\'s </p><p>greatest concern is that the USG and governments of other </p><p>developed countries provide necessary and adequate technical </p><p>assistance, particularly in relation to TRIPS requirements. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GON PREPARATIONS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On July 27 the Ministry of Commerce hosted a briefing </p><p>for the diplomatic community on Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>preparations for the second Working Party meeting on </p><p>accession to the WTO, to be held in Geneva September 12. </p><p>Commerce Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka, who will head the </p><p>delegation, assured attendees of his government\'s commitment </p><p>to bring its trade regime into conformity with WTO standards, </p><p>and asked that attendees\' governments support Nepal\'s bid to </p><p>enter WTO.  Commerce Ministry Joint Secretary Prachanda Man </p><p>Shrestha also provided a brief overview of the GON\'s revised </p><p>market access offers for goods and services since the first </p><p>Working Party meeting in 2000.  Both presentations </p><p>highlighted GON expectations that the "good will" of </p><p>developed countries--i.e., a recognition of Nepal\'s </p><p>limitations and constraints as an LDC--will be a significant </p><p>factor in the upcoming Working Party meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  In a September 2 meeting with emboff, Shrestha </p><p>asserted that the GON\'s revised offer on tariffs, which he </p><p>said average about 40 percent for agricultural products and </p><p>about 30 percent for non-agricultural, are well below those </p><p>of other South Asian countries.  He acknowledged the </p><p>assessment of surcharges on the tariffs--as much as 4.5 </p><p>percent for non-agricultural products--which he described as </p><p>local development and security fees.  Agricultural products, </p><p>which face an added agricultural development fee, are </p><p>assessed surcharges of as much as 9.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Shrestha argued that the GON had substantially </p><p>broadened its offer of market access for services from no </p><p>more than three in 2000 to eleven sectors and sub-sectors in </p><p>2002.  Emboff asked why the GON had not opened up more </p><p>financial services in the revised offer.  Shrestha replied </p><p>that the GON--in particular the Central Bank--has not yet </p><p>fully assessed the possible effect that inviting broader </p><p>foreign participation in the banking sector could have on </p><p>Nepal\'s economy and modest foreign exchange reserves.  The </p><p>Central Bank is particularly leery of opening up banking to </p><p>foreign investment, he said.  Discussions on the margins of </p><p>WP2 between members of the USG delegation and the GON\'s </p><p>Central Bank representative regarding these concerns would be </p><p>helpful, he agreed.  Much of the GON\'s worry regarding </p><p>opening up the financial sector focuses on India, he </p><p>confided, rather than on other potential foreign investors. </p><p>Some quarters in the GON fear that liberalizing market access </p><p>in the financial sector would result in the small Nepali </p><p>market being swamped and completely dominated by Indian </p><p>investors.  If there is genuine, specific American interest </p><p>in Nepal\'s modest market, Shrestha indicated, the GON </p><p>delegation would welcome further discussion of possible </p><p>revisions to its services market access offer with the USG </p><p>delegation. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>GON NEEDS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Shrestha said the GON\'s greatest concern in </p><p>embarking on WP2 is that it receive adequate technical </p><p>assistance from developed nations to meet its requirements </p><p>under WTO.  Of special concern is the GON\'s ability to comply </p><p>with TRIPS obligations, he noted, an area in which the GON </p><p>has no expertise.  During the first Working Party in 2000, </p><p>the GON received numerous pledges of technical assistance </p><p>from various countries (Shrestha says the USG had </p><p>specifically committed to provide assistance in customs </p><p>valuation), but so far not one country has delivered. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>USG AID TO DATE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The USAID Mission in Nepal has agreed to fund </p><p>travel and per diem for a U.S. Customs assessment team to </p><p>review GON requirements for customs valuation assistance. </p><p>The Mission\'s Economic Growth program is closing out at the </p><p>end of this fiscal year, however, and it is uncertain if </p><p>USAID Nepal will thus be able to provide follow-on funding </p><p>for any actual training or equipment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>POLITICAL CLIMATE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba asked the King </p><p>to dissolve Parliament May 22 and call mid-term elections for </p><p>November 13.  Deuba remains in power, along with most of his </p><p>original Cabinet, until then.  Because Maoist insurgents, who </p><p>have been waging a six-year effort to overthrow Nepal\'s </p><p>constitutional monarchy, are expected to attempt to disrupt </p><p>the elections, the polling may be conducted in phases in </p><p>various parts of the country, elongating the election </p><p>schedule considerably.  The new Cabinet and Parliament may </p><p>thus not be in place before January.  Accession to WTO enjoys </p><p>broad, multipartisan support from all but a very few small, </p><p>politically insignificant parties.  The largest Opposition </p><p>party, the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML) was the first political party to endorse publicly </p><p>Nepal\'s efforts to accede to WTO.  None of the likely (and </p><p>even not-so-likely) winners of the November election is </p><p>expected to repudiate previous commitments made during the </p><p>Working Party meeting or to reverse position on accession to </p><p>WTO. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The upcoming elections have not seemed to hinder </p><p>GON preparations for WP2. WTO accession is not controversial </p><p>in Nepal and unlikely to become an election issue.  The </p><p>Commerce Ministry\'s emphasis on anticipated "good-will" </p><p>concessions in view of Nepal\'s status as an LDC and its </p><p>framing of tariff rates in a regional, rather than global </p><p>context, make it seem unlikely that the GON will offer a more </p><p>significant reduction in tariffs.  There does seem to be </p><p>latitude for further bilateral discussion of market access </p><p>for  services.  The GON will almost certainly raise its </p><p>understanding of previous USG offers to provide Nepal with </p><p>customs valuation assistance.  We recommend that the USG </p><p>formally commit to offer such assistance. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
