(C)  Summary.  Islam as a factor in politics in </p><p>southwestern Nigeria and the </p><p>threat of the imposition of Shari\'a (Koranic law) in the </p><p>south are not current </p><p>or near-term possibilities.  However, all observers agree </p><p>that overwhelming </p><p>poverty, and uncertainty and possible instability in </p><p>government in Nigeria are </p><p>factors that could lead to some future politicization of </p><p>Islam in the region. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Northern Nigeria has had a significant Muslim </p><p>population (Hausa and </p><p>Fulani ethnic groups) since the eleventh century, and is </p><p>today over 90 percent </p><p>Muslim.  Only as recently as the nineteenth century has Islam </p><p>spread </p><p>significantly in the south.  Southern Muslims (mainly in the </p><p>Yoruba southwest) </p><p>have lived peacefully with their Christian and animist </p><p>countrymen for decades. </p><p>However, according to researchers on the issue of the rise of </p><p>political or </p><p>fundamentalist Islam, conditions in all of Nigeria over the </p><p>past decade have </p><p>become ideal for the development of politicized Islam.  They </p><p>point to the facts </p><p>that Nigeria is the most populous country on the continent, </p><p>Muslims probably </p><p>make up over half its population, there is wide-spread </p><p>poverty, political </p><p>instability, a weak and ineffective police force and </p><p>prodigious official </p><p>corruption all of which have, in other majority Muslim </p><p>countries, led to the </p><p>rise of dissident Islamists.  Some Muslims have addressed </p><p>social grievances </p><p>through religious expression in fundamentalist appeals to </p><p>piety or challenges </p><p>to the political status quo.  It should be noted here that </p><p>Usama bin Laden\'s </p><p>original protest was against what he believed to be the </p><p>corrupt, greedy, and </p><p>ineffective ruling al Saud family who claimed to be the </p><p>protectors of the </p><p>holiest places in Islam, but who allowed US troops </p><p>(non-Muslims) to defile </p><p>Saudi soil by their very presence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In 1999 Nigeria transitioned from military to civilian </p><p>rule and </p><p>installed retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian </p><p>Yoruba from the south, </p><p>as President.  According to southern observers, this was </p><p>accomplished only because </p><p>Obasanjo and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) agreed to </p><p>support the official </p><p>adoption of Shari\'a law in several northern states. </p><p>(Comment. Several of our </p><p>southern interlocutors, Christian and Muslim and from several </p><p>political parties, </p><p>say that adoption of Shari\'a led to an increase in </p><p>ethnic/religious conflict and </p><p>confrontations between Muslims and Christians in the north </p><p>over the past four </p><p>years.  The Muslim majority in the north scored a political </p><p>point with Shari\'a, </p><p>and they press that point home at every opportunity.  End </p><p>comment.) The events </p><p>of September 11, 2001, further heightened Nigeria\'s </p><p>visibility, along with other </p><p>west African countries, as a majority Muslim country and a </p><p>possible breeding </p><p>ground for Islamist fundamentalist terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Questions of regional stability prompted </p><p>investigation of whether Islam </p><p>is on the rise and becoming more political in the country. </p><p>When a Muslim woman </p><p>(Amina Lawal) from the North was sentenced to death by </p><p>stoning, several </p><p>contestants in the Miss World Pageant that was to be held in </p><p>Nigeria in </p><p>November, 2002, protested by refusing to come to Nigeria. </p><p>Shortly after the </p><p>remaining contestants arrived, an article in a national </p><p>newspaper that </p><p>allegedly "insulted" the prophet Mohammed set off Muslim </p><p>riots that left 200 </p><p>dead.  These events and the continuing ethnic/political </p><p>conflicts in the North </p><p>also raise unease about the possible upsurge in political </p><p>Islam in the South. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State of Islam in the South </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PolOff met with the Secretary General of the </p><p>Lagos-based Nigerian </p><p>Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Dr. Lateef Adegbite. </p><p>Adegbite said that </p><p>there is no conflict between Muslims in the south and other </p><p>religions here. </p><p>Although he could not give even a rough estimate of the </p><p>current number of </p><p>Muslims in the south, he said that Islam is growing steadily </p><p>in the region and </p><p>the concern of the Muslim community is to fund and build </p><p>enough schools </p><p>(madrassas) for increasing numbers of Muslim children. </p><p>According to Adegbite, </p><p>there is no pressure to adopt Shari\'a in the south, and the </p><p>uproar over the </p><p>Lawal case will be resolved peacefully by the courts. </p><p>Adegbite\'s views on </p><p>other possible areas of religious friction are conservative </p><p>and track the views </p><p>of other Muslim sources.  He told us that many Muslims, in </p><p>Nigeria and </p><p>worldwide, were convinced the War on Terrorism is a war </p><p>against Muslims, and he </p><p>added the familiar charge that the US has a "double standard" </p><p>when dealing with </p><p>the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>Supreme Council </p><p>has no authority to appoint or remove Muslim clergy, nor to </p><p>review or </p><p>standardize the Friday mosque sermons, unlike many other </p><p>majority Muslim </p><p>countries.  As a consequence, Adegbite said he has no way to </p><p>determine if an </p><p>individual mosque, or southern mosques in general, are </p><p>becoming politicized, </p><p>but he doubts this could be the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PolSpecs from Abuja and Lagos spent several days in </p><p>January interviewing </p><p>key members of the Muslim communities in Lagos, Ibadan and </p><p>other towns in the </p><p>southwest about their views on the status of Islam in the </p><p>region.  (Comment. </p><p>All observers agree that Muslims do not make up a significant </p><p>percentage of the </p><p>population in the southeast or south-central regions.  Thus, </p><p>the PolSpecs </p><p>concentrated their efforts in the southwest.  End comment.) </p><p>After a number of </p><p>interviews, they reached the general conclusion that religion </p><p>is not a major </p><p>factor in the political calculations of residents and </p><p>politicians in the </p><p>southwest.  However, they reported that many of their </p><p>interlocutors were also </p><p>quick to point out that Islam is growing in the region, </p><p>Muslims are being more </p><p>assertive and, thus, religion could at some point in the </p><p>future become a </p><p>political issue.  Some Muslims reported seeing signs now, </p><p>such as growing </p><p>religious intolerance and exclusion based on religion, that </p><p>may be the </p><p>precursors of future religious strife and disruptions of </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A scholar\'s view </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  In Ibadan, PolSpecs met with Ahmeed Agberemi, a </p><p>highly respected </p><p>Islamic scholar.  Agberemi told them that Muslims object to </p><p>the use of the word </p><p>"fundamentalist" when discussing Islam, and disagree with </p><p>most Westerners\' </p><p>definition of the term.  "What we should be concerned about," </p><p>he declared, "is </p><p>rising \'essentialism\' in all the major religions."  He </p><p>explained that </p><p>essentialism, often mistaken for fundamentalism, has an </p><p>overarching presence </p><p>within and across national boundaries, and has the potential </p><p>to influence </p><p>socio-political outcomes, not only in Nigeria, but globally </p><p>as well.  Agberemi </p><p>said he does not believe that fundamentalism is, as yet, a </p><p>problem in the </p><p>southwest, nor does he think that the region\'s politics are </p><p>currently </p><p>influenced in any way by religion.  "Unlike in the north," he </p><p>said, "where </p><p>there are extreme forms of Islam, the 50-50 Christian to </p><p>Muslim demographic </p><p>split in most southwestern States precludes the possibility </p><p>of the ascendance </p><p>to power by Islamists of whatever persuasion."  On the </p><p>subject of Shari\'a, </p><p>Agberemi said the likelihood of southwestern States\' enacting </p><p>Shari\'a law was </p><p>extremely remote.  He was more concerned, however, with what </p><p>he said is a </p><p>growing use of inciting rhetoric in speeches by Muslim </p><p>leaders and in the </p><p>mosques sermons.  He concluded, saying that the recent </p><p>debates and discussions </p><p>in Nigeria about identity, ethnicity and the role of religion </p><p>in government, </p><p>are "notions that merely inhibit pluralities of ideas while </p><p>justifying </p><p>exclusion, hatred and violence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Muslim woman\'s view </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) PolSpecs also met with Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, </p><p>Executive Director of the </p><p>Lagos-based Center for Women Advocates, Research and </p><p>Documentation. </p><p>Akiyode-Afolabi is also a noted supporter of and campaigner </p><p>for Muslim women\'s </p><p>rights.  Although she generally agreed with the thoughts of </p><p>Agberimi, she </p><p>warned that a failing economy and massive poverty could drive </p><p>Nigerians "to the </p><p>point where they seek social justice through politicized </p><p>religion."  She said </p><p>some Muslim politicians in the past had tried to get </p><p>co-religionists\' votes by </p><p>passing out food and oney.  She predicted that this might </p><p>again be the </p><p>situation in the upcoming elections because of the alarming </p><p>rate of poverty. </p><p>As to real politicized Islam, that is, Muslims voting for </p><p>Muslims only because </p><p>of their religion, or Muslims voting for Muslims in the hope </p><p>of influencing </p><p>government with Islamic tenets, Akiyode-Afolabi said she had </p><p>not seen this in </p><p>the southwest--yet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A politician\'s view </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  In a private conversation with Ambassador and CG </p><p>(septel), Lagos State </p><p>Governor Bola Tinubu, himself a Muslim, concurred that Islam </p><p>is not politicized </p><p>in the south.  Tinubu opined that in the southeast and </p><p>southwest, religion is </p><p>less important to voters than a candidate\'s political record </p><p>or personality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment.  Based on our interviews and the opinions of </p><p>political </p><p>observers in the southwest, we conclude that Islam and the </p><p>possibility of </p><p>Shari\'a law are not political concerns for the near-term in </p><p>southwestern </p><p>Nigeria.  Islam in the southwest is relatively new, compared </p><p>to that in the </p><p>north, and may be too young to flex its muscles here.  Even </p><p>growing Muslim </p><p>activities in the region, especially the sudden emergence and </p><p>fast growth of </p><p>"Nasfat" groups (Muslim youth organizations)  in Lagos and </p><p>other parts of the </p><p>southwest, do not appear to be an indication of the </p><p>politicization of Islam; </p><p>instead these activities are an effort by Muslim elite to </p><p>turn Muslim youth </p><p>from the seduction of a robust Pentecostal movement by making </p><p>Muslim ritual </p><p>more "Christian-like."  For the long-term, however, all of </p><p>our sources agree </p><p>that if socio-economic conditions do not improve, there is a </p><p>reasonable </p><p>possibility of a future politicization of Islam in both </p><p>northern and southern </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
