<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 KUWAIT 002949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, G/IWI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ETRD, KPAO, KU, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SCUL, SOCI </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) MEPI 03-04: COUNTRY STRATEGY FOR KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 126550 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) Post welcomes the opportunity to present this MEPI </p><p>country strategy </p><p>for Kuwait.  As we consider how best to engage on these </p><p>issues, particularly on </p><p>sensitive issues such as political reform and education </p><p>(where the U.S. has </p><p>already been unjustly accused of inappropriate interference), </p><p>it is important to ensure that we do a lot of listening </p><p>before endorsing specific projects, and that we work behind </p><p>the scenes to build up the capacity of like-minded local </p><p>advocacy groups to press their case.  We will also need to </p><p>spend sufficient time and effort to persuade Kuwait\'s leaders </p><p>that their national interest is best served by reform.  (This </p><p>is a point that they seem to accept intellectually, but on </p><p>which they are either unwilling or unable to act.) </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) The strategies below are delineated by pillar. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM PILLAR </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Where Kuwait should be in three to five years: </p><p>The challenge for Kuwait is to reduce the role of the public </p><p>sector in the </p><p>economy.  Within three to five years, frameworks to regulate </p><p>privatized industries (including the introduction and </p><p>enforcement of a rigorous competition policy) should be in </p><p>place.  Current barriers to investment (including outdated </p><p>agency laws and ownership restrictions) should be falling, as </p><p>should barriers to trade (such as the wrong-headed </p><p>International Conformity Certificate Program).  Kuwait should </p><p>begin taking an active role in the WTO.  Trade and customs </p><p>rules should be sufficiently modernized and streamlined to </p><p>ensure that the country is the main entrepot for movement of </p><p>goods and services into a rebuilding Iraq. Small-scale </p><p>privatizations should have begun. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) Strategies to get there: </p><p> </p><p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Reform: </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(Supports MEPI Goals of global competitiveness and </p><p>encouraging investment.) </p><p>Kuwait\'s current IPR laws (the Copyright law, specifically) </p><p>are not fully TRIPS </p><p>compliant.  Further, enforcement mechanisms are weak, </p><p>penalties are barely a </p><p>slap on the wrist, and judges and prosecutors do not have </p><p>sufficient background </p><p>or training.  As a result, piracy rates in Kuwait are </p><p>approaching 80 percent </p><p>for some products. </p><p> </p><p>Improving IPR protection will require several steps: </p><p>programs to review and </p><p>improve current legal frameworks (working with both </p><p>government and National </p><p>Assembly representatives); extended training and/or technical </p><p>assistance </p><p>programs for police investigators and officers on detecting </p><p>and apprehending </p><p>pirates; and extended training and/or technical assistance </p><p>programs to train </p><p>judges and prosecutors.  Justice officials will also benefit </p><p>from programs that </p><p>focus on rules of evidence, and on the benefits of </p><p>establishing a special IPR </p><p>court.  Finally, we should work with GOK officials on a </p><p>public relations </p><p>campaign to change attitudes about IPR protection. </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Law Reform </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(Supports MEPI Goals of global competitiveness and </p><p>encouraging investment.) </p><p>Current commercial laws in Kuwait are not extraordinarily </p><p>bad, but the legal </p><p>process is slow and opaque.  Tax law, on the other hand, is </p><p>bad (with a top </p><p>rate of 55 percent), old (passed in 1955), discriminatory </p><p>(applies only to </p><p>non-Kuwaiti firms) and opaque (the tax department appears to </p><p>rule anyway it </p><p>wants, regularly ignoring precedent).  The lack of </p><p>consistency, transparency, and predictability of both tax and </p><p>commercial law are key impediments to attracting both foreign </p><p>and domestic investment. </p><p> </p><p>The GOK has on several occasions requested consultations with </p><p>Treasury on </p><p>negotiating a bilateral tax treaty and the request has been </p><p>turned down flat </p><p>due to the discriminatory nature of the GOK tax law.  We </p><p>recommend engaging the </p><p>GOK in serious discussions on such a treaty, but hinging the </p><p>conclusion of the </p><p>agreement on deep changes in the current GOK tax scheme.  As </p><p>for commercial Law </p><p>Reform, we understand that the Department of Justice is </p><p>moving forward with </p><p>plans to establish a Regional Legal Advisor (RLA) position in </p><p>the Gulf; we </p><p>believe this is an excellent step.  Additionally (and cross </p><p>cutting to </p><p>political reform and the President\'s plan for training </p><p>parliamentarians), </p><p>Kuwait\'s National Assembly has very few professional staff in </p><p>key areas such as </p><p>researching and drafting legislation.  A technical assistance </p><p>program to help </p><p>the legislature build professional staff for its key </p><p>committees, or even to </p><p>establish something along the lines of our own Congressional </p><p>Research Service, </p><p>would immensely enhance the Assembly\'s effectiveness.  Also, </p><p>in an effort to </p><p>increase transparency, the USG could work with our OECD </p><p>partners in a </p><p>determined effort to get Gulf States like Kuwait to abide by </p><p>the OECD\'s </p><p>anti-bribery conventions. </p><p> </p><p>Reducing the Role of Government in the Economy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>(Supports MEPI Goals of Encouraging Investment and </p><p>Facilitating SME Growth.) </p><p>Approximately 92 percent of employed Kuwaiti citizens work </p><p>for the Kuwaiti government, and approximately 80 percent of </p><p>budgeted government revenues are used to pay salaries and </p><p>wages.  The government dominates nearly every facet of the </p><p>economy; public-sector wages and salaries have become a </p><p>mechanism to distribute oil wealth. </p><p> </p><p>While many proclaim that privatization is the only solution, </p><p>privatization </p><p>alone will not be sufficient.  Before privatization begins, </p><p>the USG should </p><p>offer technical assistance in developing regulatory systems </p><p>and comprehensive, </p><p>rigorous competition policy, to ensure that public monopolies </p><p>do not simply </p><p>become private monopolies.  In addition, prior to privatizing </p><p>state-owned firms and government services, competition and </p><p>investment rules should be written to </p><p>encourage domestic and foreign investment.  Training programs </p><p>to improve </p><p>business skills of displaced government workers and new </p><p>graduates (both men and </p><p>women) will be necessary to ensure that these new entrants </p><p>into the private </p><p>labor force have the required expertise (cross cuts to the </p><p>Education pillar). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>EDUCATION REFORM PILLAR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Where Kuwait should be in three to five years: </p><p>School curricula emphasize excellence in math and science </p><p>skills, focusing on </p><p>critical thinking skills and preparation to enter the </p><p>(private) workplace.  New </p><p>private universities expand educational choice and create </p><p>competition for </p><p>educational services. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Strategies to get there: </p><p> </p><p>The issue of educational reform is highly politicized in </p><p>Kuwait.  Islamists </p><p>have in the past (falsely) accused the embassy of pushing for </p><p>the expurgation </p><p>of Quranic texts from school curricula, and a senior Ministry </p><p>of Education </p><p>official, a noted progressive administrator, has told us that </p><p>she fears that </p><p>USG program involvement in educational reform would be a </p><p>lightning rod for </p><p>local criticism.  Any MEPI educational initiatives involving </p><p>Kuwait must, </p><p>therefore, have the lightest USG fingerprint possible if they </p><p>are to succeed. </p><p>With this caveat in mind, we propose the following strategies: </p><p> </p><p>- Use the International Visitor program to expose Ministry of </p><p>Education </p><p>officials to curriculum reform/civil society programs in the </p><p>US, and build on </p><p>these relationships to influence internal reform efforts. </p><p>(Post is sending an </p><p>MOE official charged with curriculum development on an </p><p>upcoming civil society </p><p>IV program this fall.) </p><p> </p><p>- Establish summer programs in the US for Kuwaiti middle/high </p><p>school students </p><p>ages 12-17. Such a program would allow young Kuwaitis an </p><p>opportunity to see </p><p>themselves and their culture in an international context--an </p><p>important goal in </p><p>an environment where Islamist teachers and administrators </p><p>sometimes impart a </p><p>stridently polarized and sectarian worldview to the young. </p><p> </p><p>- Seek GOK involvement in proposed MEPI Arabic book </p><p>translation pilot program </p><p>for third and fourth grades.  (Again, USG profile for this </p><p>program would have </p><p>to be very low.) </p><p> </p><p>- Communicate to Kuwaiti audiences that countries that adopt </p><p>educational </p><p>strategies that emphasize critical thinking, foreign </p><p>languages and knowledge of </p><p>foreign cultures tend to be strong and well-integrated into </p><p>the international </p><p>economy, while countries that do not tend to be weak and </p><p>isolated.  Use speaker </p><p>programs, op/eds and discussions by embassy officers to </p><p>emphasize this point. </p><p> </p><p>--Work with Kuwait University to establish American Studies </p><p>courses and </p><p>increase American studies course content. </p><p> </p><p>--Explore opportunities to develop cooperative relationships </p><p>with Kuwait\'s new private universities as they begin </p><p>operations. </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM PILLAR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Where Kuwait should be in three to five years: </p><p>Women have full </p><p>political rights.  All citizens have full political rights. </p><p>Political parties </p><p>allowed to form and participate in the political process. </p><p>Kuwait\'s parliament </p><p>becoming a partner in, and not an obstacle to, the country\'s </p><p>political and </p><p>economic development.  Kuwaitis begin to understand that the </p><p>rights of </p><p>citizenship also come with significant responsibilities. </p><p>NGOs to track </p><p>government transparency and accountability begin in operate </p><p>in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Strategies to get there (all support MEPI goals of </p><p>strengthening </p><p>democratic processes and promoting the rule of law and </p><p>accountable, effective </p><p>government institutions): </p><p> </p><p>Women\'s political rights: </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Our overall strategy must be to support indigenous efforts. </p><p>It would be </p><p>counter-productive to foster public perception that the US </p><p>seeks to impose its </p><p>own cultural or religious values.  We propose a program of </p><p>concurrent </p><p>interventions targeting three audiences:  women\'s-rights </p><p>advocates themselves, </p><p>Kuwaiti society at large, and policy makers. </p><p> </p><p>- Strengthen the capacity of women\'s advocacy groups through </p><p> </p><p>-- establish a Leadership Development Institute for women in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p>Kuwaiti womens\' rights activists have already been in contact </p><p>with NDI on this </p><p>issue; </p><p> </p><p>-- workshops on developing effective advocacy campaigns. </p><p>Kuwaiti womens\' </p><p>rights activists have expressed interest in mounting an </p><p>advocacy campaign to </p><p>push for equal benefits for women under Kuwait\'s child </p><p>allowance law; </p><p> </p><p>-- facilitation of contacts and mutual support among Arab and </p><p>Muslim women from </p><p>many countries. </p><p> </p><p>- Help Kuwaiti women transcend their social and political </p><p>differences through a </p><p>gender-budgeting analysis (funding requested per ref B) to </p><p>highlight issues of </p><p>common concern, such as unequal treatment of female-headed </p><p>households, gender </p><p>imbalance in health,  education and family-related services. </p><p> </p><p>- Raise public consciousness of the impact on society of the </p><p>degree of female </p><p>empowerment, through guest speakers, publications, </p><p>round-tables, media events. </p><p> </p><p>- Dialogue with policy makers:  senior USG officials should </p><p>convey consistently </p><p>that gender equality is both politically important to us and </p><p>highly beneficial </p><p>to society.  Decision-makers should be exposed to the same </p><p>substantive </p><p>information used in public consciousness raising. </p><p> </p><p>Political parties: </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>The impediment to the existence of political parties is </p><p>governmental </p><p>opposition, presumably based on fear that parties would be </p><p>harder to control. </p><p>The result is that the most organized groups in the National </p><p>Assembly are the </p><p>Islamists, who share a defined ideology and agenda (though </p><p>even they are </p><p>divided into at least four distinct groups in the Assembly). </p><p>We propose a </p><p>strategy of policy dialogue and public awareness-raising, </p><p>featuring consistent </p><p>affirmations of the right of association, and examination of </p><p>the impact the </p><p>prohibition on political parties is having on the character </p><p>and quality of the </p><p>National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>Parliament: </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait\'s National Assembly is the oldest national democratic </p><p>institution in any </p><p>of the Arab Gulf states.  As such, it is a source of national </p><p>pride and a </p><p>factor in the stability of the country.  Yet the institution </p><p>shows very mixed </p><p>quality -- not surprising, as some of its members can be </p><p>elected with less than </p><p>a thousand votes.  We propose to offer access to </p><p>capacity-building courses for </p><p>members and staffers.  Key areas of interest include budget </p><p>analysis; effective </p><p>oversight; and research skills/resources, so that on a given </p><p>issue the Assembly </p><p>can draw on best practices and lessons learned from around </p><p>the world. </p><p> </p><p>Civil-society monitoring of government: </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>We propose to strengthen the ability of existing NGOs to act </p><p>as responsible </p><p>"watchdogs," by offering training workshops and facilitating </p><p>institutional </p><p>contact with reputable similar organizations abroad.  We also </p><p>propose that the </p><p>US policy dialogue with the GOK encourage openness to </p><p>responsible civil-society </p><p>watchdog groups.  The following themes suggest themselves: </p><p>transparency and </p><p>accountability are fundamental to the long-term health of </p><p>government and the </p><p>stability of society; all governments are subject to outside </p><p>scrutiny in </p><p>today\'s inter-connected world; Kuwait\'s international </p><p>reputation is best </p><p>protected by openness and responsiveness. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
