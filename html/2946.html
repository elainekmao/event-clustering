<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>DOJ FOR ICITAP--BARR/BEINHART </p><p>. </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: INSPECTOR GENERAL APPROVES POLICE REFORM PROJECT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sensitive But Unclassified -- Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) RNLEO met with Nigeria\'s new Inspector General of </p><p>Police, Tafa Balogun, May 14 at Police Headquarters in Abuja </p><p>to discuss the INL/ICITAP Police Reform Project.  This </p><p>meeting followed a late April introductory call on Balogun by </p><p>Ambassador Jeter who pushed for the IGP\'s early approval of </p><p>this important project so that implementation could commence </p><p>quickly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Balogun was open in his endorsement of the project, </p><p>noting that it would serve the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) </p><p>well.  He disclosed that he had written the President on the </p><p>proposed USG program.  According to Balogun, President </p><p>Obasanjo issued instructions to accept the project in its </p><p>entirety as this was an issue of great importance to him and </p><p>something he had requested from the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The IGP, however, raised one proposed change to the </p><p>project.  He expressed the desire to have the Program </p><p>Manager/Police Advisor (PM) based in Jos, rather than in </p><p>Abuja.  He reasoned that the PM would have closer access to </p><p>the project\'s training activity occurring in Jos, would enjoy </p><p>better weather, and could travel to Abuja regularly.  RNLEO </p><p>responded by noting that a senior Training Advisor is already </p><p>slated to commence work in Jos in June; therefore, the </p><p>training work in Jos is covered.  Moreover, the Project </p><p>Manager would find it difficult to fulfill his </p><p>responsibilities of overseeing all project activities and </p><p>providing support to the IGP and others in NPF headquarters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The meeting closed with Balogun pledging to write the </p><p>Embassy formally to indicate his approval of the INL/ICITAP </p><p>project and to give us his decision on the placement of the </p><p>Program Manager/Police Advisor.  Balogun encouraged the USG </p><p>to send the PM and training advisors to Nigeria as soon as </p><p>possible.  He also requested RNLEO to hold discussions on the </p><p>"nitty-gritty" of the project with senior NPF managers as </p><p>soon as the project personnel arrive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) Comment:  At long last, the USG\'s police reform </p><p>project is ready for launch and, Washington funding </p><p>arrangements permitting, Embassy hopes for an early June </p><p>formal start.  President Obasanjo\'s personal commitment to </p><p>police reform was on display as he intervened to see this </p><p>project through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU)Comment Cont\'d:  The resistance to putting the PM in </p><p>Police Headquarters in Abuja -- and the attempt to sideline </p><p>him in Jos -- most likely reflects nationalistic sentiment </p><p>among some senior NPF managers and not Balogun\'s own views. </p><p>Earlier informal comments offered by officials in the NPF and </p><p>the Police Service Commission indicated some resistance among </p><p>Balogun\'s seven Deputy Inspectors General to U.S. police </p><p>officer resident in NPF Headquarters.  As such, Balogun\'s </p><p>desired change was not a surprise.  It did not, however, </p><p>appear cleared by the Presidency and, after RNLEO argued that </p><p>the Police Advisor remain as planned in Abuja, it appears the </p><p>IGP may give on this point. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
