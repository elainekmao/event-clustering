(SBU) THE HOLY SEE OUTLINED ITS CONCERNS ABOUT MOUNTING </p><p>UNREST IN THE NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI  IN THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) IN A NOTE PASSED TO EMBASSY MARCH 24. </p><p> THE VATICAN IS CALLING ON THE PARTIES TO "RESPECT AGREEMENTS </p><p>ALREADY SIGNED AND RESUME NEGOTIATIONS."  THE HOLY SEE, WITH </p><p>CLERGY IN COMMUNITIES ON ALL SIDES OF THIS MULTIFACETED </p><p>    CONFLICT, IS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT RECENT GAINS IN THE CONGO </p><p>PEACE PROCESS ARE AGAIN AT RISK FROM THE MILITARY OCCUPATION </p><p>OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE ASKED US TO </p><p>BRING THEIR CONCERNS TO THE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION AND WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE U.S. SUPPORT FOR THEIR POSITION AS OUTLINED IN </p><p>THEIR PRO-MEMORIA NOTE TO ENCOURAGE ADHESION TO THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS AND RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE TEXT OF THE NOTE FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>IN RECENT TIMES, THE ALREADY COMPLICATED SITUATION IN THE </p><p>NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI (DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO) </p><p>HAS INCREASINGLY WORSENED, INCLUDING A MILITARY OCCUPATION OF </p><p>THE CITY OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES (UPDF) WHO HAVE </p><p>CAUSED THE MILITIA OF THE MOVEMENT UNION DES PATRIOTES </p><p>CONGOLAIS (UPC) TO FLEE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF KIGALI HAS </p><p>PUBLISHED A DECLARATION THREATENING A REPOSITIONING OF </p><p>RWANDAN TROOPS IN CONGO:  "IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS </p><p>FOUND IT ACCEPTABLE FOR UGANDA TO RETURN TO THE DRC, FOR ALL </p><p>THE DUBIOUS REASONS IT HAS GIVEN, THEN IT IS LEGITIMATE THAT </p><p>RWANDA SHOULD GO IN THE DRC TO CONTAIN THIS NEW SITUATION" </p><p>(STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION, MARCH 14TH, 2003). </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSES ITS CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH A POSITION WILL HAVE ON </p><p>THE STRAINED PEACE PROCESS IN THE REGION, AS WELL AS ON THE </p><p>CIVIL POPULATION SUFFERING THE VIOLENCE OF THE VARIOUS ARMED </p><p>GROUPS FIGHTING IN THAT REGION. </p><p></p><p>FOR THESE REASONS, THE HOLY SEE ASKS THE INTERESTED PARTIES </p><p>TO AVOID FURTHER SUFFERING OF UNARMED CIVILIANS, TO RESPECT </p><p>THE AGREEMENT FOR THE CEASE-FIRE AND TO WITHDRAW FOREIGN </p><p>TROOPS FROM CONGOLESE TERRITORY, TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS FOR </p><p>PEACE IN THE AREA AND TO PUT INTO PLACE A TRANSITIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE HAS ASKED THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIOS IN </p><p>THE INTERESTED COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE PERMANENT OBSERVERS </p><p>TO THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK AND GENEVA, TO </p><p>PRESENT THESE CONCERNS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, IT APPEALS TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHICH MAINTAIN CLOSE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES OF THE GREAT LAKES </p><p>REGION, URGING BOTH THEM AND THE MILITIA TO WORK MORE </p><p>DECISIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY TOWARDS A LASTING PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE VATICAN, 24 MARCH 2003. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) COMMENT:  BECAUSE THE HOLY SEE HAS CLERGY ON ALL </p><p>SIDES OF THIS CONFLICT, THEY HAVE GENERALLY AVOIDED TAKING </p><p>STANDS ON ANY SIDE OF THE CONFLICT.  THEIR DECISION TO ENGAGE </p><p>AT THIS TIME WITH A NOTE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES AND OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ENGAGED IN THE PEACE EFFORT REFLECTS THEIR FEAR </p><p>THAT THE PROGRESS ATTAINED TO DATE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION </p><p>IS AT RISK OF FALLING APART.  IT ALSO RESPONDS TO A RECENT </p><p>ADMONITION FROM THE POPE, WHO CAUTIONED IN A RECENT AUDIENCE </p><p>THAT, IN THE FACE OF THE FOCUS ON IRAQ, THAT THE WORLD NOT </p><p>NEGLECT THE MANY OTHER WARS AND CONFLICTS THAT THREATENED </p><p>    HUMANITY. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01329 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
