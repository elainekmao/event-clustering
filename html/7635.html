<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI ELECTION HEATS UP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 875 </p><p>     B. SANAA 818 </p><p>     C. SANAA 706 </p><p>     D. SANAA 263 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  With three days left in the campaign, </p><p>Yemen\'s April 27 parliamentary elections dominate the </p><p>political scene (refs b and c).  The opposition Islah party </p><p>looks likely to gain seats against the ruling General </p><p>People\'s Congress (GPC), although no observers predict that </p><p>the GPC will lose its majority.  A war of harsh words between </p><p>the political parties has not yet escalated into violence. </p><p>Yemen has declared April 27 a "weapons free day" in another </p><p>measure to help ensure peaceful elections.  More than 30,000 </p><p>international and domestic election observers will deploy to </p><p>assess the conduct of Yemen,s third parliamentary election </p><p>(ref a).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Predictions Difficult, </p><p>but Islah Will Likely Narrow the Gap </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Even though the campaign is almost over, predictions </p><p>of probable winners remain complicated.  Clear differences in </p><p>campaign issues are for the most part difficult to discern </p><p>between the parties, leaving the process of the campaign a </p><p>more important factor in its outcome.  A well organized </p><p>campaign by the Islah party, coupled with what some observers </p><p>call poor candidate selection by the GPC, make it likely that </p><p>the wide gap between the GPC and Islah in the last parliament </p><p>will be narrowed from the previous 223 to 64 margin. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Evidence of the Islah party\'s strong campaign is </p><p>clear.  Islah party activists are going door-to-door in their </p><p>constituencies asking citizens for their vote.  Their </p><p>campaign literature is well-composed and modern in style, </p><p>with clear and concise messages.  Islah party banners, </p><p>posters, flags and mountain sculptures of their party symbol, </p><p>the sun, blanket Sanaa, Marib, Aden and other areas of Yemen. </p><p> In contrast, while the GPC has also blanketed Yemen with </p><p>such material, there is little evidence of door-to-door </p><p>campaigning or well-crafted campaign literature.  As one GPC </p><p>Shura Council member lamented to Pol/Econoff, the GPC is like </p><p>an elephant when it comes to embracing modern campaign </p><p>methods -- if one grabs its foot, it takes a long time for </p><p>the touch to reach its brain.  He also noted that being in </p><p>government allows for laziness in the campaign, while being </p><p>in opposition makes their supporters motivated to work hard. </p><p>According to him, the strong Islah grassroots campaign has </p><p>many GPC party leaders concerned. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Informed observers expect the Yemeni Socialist Party </p><p>(YSP) -- which boycotted the 1997 election -- to gain between </p><p>10 and 15 seats, with small numbers of other seats going to </p><p>various smaller political parties and independents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Campaign Rife with Partisan Fighting </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  A battle is waging via faxes, newspapers, electronic </p><p>media and word of mouth between political parties accusing </p><p>each other of unfair campaign practices and violations of </p><p>election law.  Accusations run the gamut from exploiting </p><p>government property for campaigning to using rhetoric </p><p>intended to incite to tearing down each other\'s posters to </p><p>interfering with campaign rallies.  Opposition parties also </p><p>raised concerns about the use of State media in favor of the </p><p>GPC and various actions by the Supreme Commission for </p><p>Elections and Referenda (SCER), including allegedly </p><p>preventing some opposition party election commissioners from </p><p>working and erroneously eliminating some candidates by citing </p><p>improper registration.  Observers characterize these </p><p>complaints, however, as minor. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Disputes in several constituencies have caused </p><p>concern and, in some cases, direct action by the SCER.  For </p><p>example, according to the UNDP, the election has been </p><p>suspended in one constituency because one political party </p><p>continues to hold hostage a ballot box from the 1997 </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Despite reported clashes in several constituencies, </p><p>there are no reports of deaths as a result of violence. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>The Al-Ahmar Clan Straddles Both Sides; </p><p>A Son Clashes with Governor </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Leader of the Islah party and former Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar has five sons running in the </p><p>elections, three for his Islah party and two for the GPC.  In </p><p>an example of tribe triumphing over party, one GPC candidate </p><p>son is being contested by a powerful Islahi Sheikh from the </p><p>same tribe.  It remains to be seen if this is a serious </p><p>challenge that could engender violence or insurance to make </p><p>sure the seat remains within the tribe. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The eldest al-Ahmar son, an Islah party candidate, </p><p>clashed with the GPC governor of Amran on April 16, injuring </p><p>several, when the governor was campaigning in the son\'s </p><p>district.  The SCER responded by suspending the election in </p><p>that constituency, while the governor offered his resignation </p><p>in protest.  However, according to a Shura Council contact, </p><p>the dispute has been resolved after high level discussions </p><p>sponsored by President Saleh.  The election is on, and the </p><p>governor is still in place. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>"Weapons Free Day" Declared; </p><p>Sporadic Violence Still Likely </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The SCER announced early this week that election </p><p>day should be "weapons free," a move echoed by ROYG </p><p>officials.  The first announcement of its kind in Yemen, it </p><p>encourages all Yemenis to leave their weapons at home to </p><p>ensure a peaceful election.  The UNDP and SCER voter </p><p>education project will include wide dissemination of the </p><p>directive as part of its overall outreach efforts, which are </p><p>widespread.  Education efforts include television skits, </p><p>radio spots, banners, cars with megaphones and information </p><p>tents in all areas of Yemen.  Some of the other messages </p><p>disseminated by the project include assuring voters that </p><p>their ballot is secret, encouraging citizens to exercise </p><p>their right to vote, reminding women to vote and instructing </p><p>voters to only vote once. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The call for a "weapons free day" is part of </p><p>several moves by government, political parties and other </p><p>stakeholders to discourage violence during the election </p><p>period.  Yemen has experienced sporadic violence in every one </p><p>of its elections and voter registration periods since </p><p>unification, including more than 20 killed during the 2001 </p><p>local elections and 7 killed during the 2002 voter </p><p>registration.  The SCER will not allow any weapons inside </p><p>voting centers.  A widely publicized "Code of Honor" was </p><p>signed April 9 by 22 political parties to encourage all </p><p>parties in Yemen to conduct free and fair campaigns and </p><p>refrain from electoral violence (ref d).  Spurred by an </p><p>initiative from IFES and NDI in late 2002, President Saleh </p><p>took sponsorship of the Code, formed a committee of political </p><p>parties and came to an agreement.  While the initiative has </p><p>significant symbolic power, neither the Code nor the </p><p>committee has any enforcement measures to ensure that the </p><p>signatories live up to the measure. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  A decision pushed by the political parties that was </p><p>issued by the SCER recently threatens to heighten tensions on </p><p>election day.  Because Yemen does not have a tradition of </p><p>citizens holding identity documents, internationals and the </p><p>SCER had intended to allow citizens to vote if they forgot </p><p>their voter registration card or other identification as long </p><p>as their name and photo could be verified on the voter lists </p><p>and attested to by all commission members.  For reasons </p><p>unclear to the UNDP director of the election support project, </p><p>the Islah party refused to go along with the suggestion. </p><p>This decision could increase the likelihood of clashes on </p><p>election day as voters without ID are turned away from the </p><p>polls. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
