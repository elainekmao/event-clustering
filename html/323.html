(U)  THESE UNPROVOKED ACTIONS BY THE PDF COME IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF NORIEGA\'S LATEST MEASURE TO CREATE A FACADE FOR </p><p>HIS CONTINUING CAMPAIGN OF SUPPRESSION OF THE PANAMANIAN </p><p>PEOPLE.  ON DECEMBER 15, AN UNELECTED ASSEMBLY OF </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS HAND-PICKED BY NORIEGA-WITHOUT ANY </p><p>LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR, INDEED, POPULAR </p><p>LEGITIMACY--DECLARED THAT PANAMA IS IN A STATE OF WAR WITH </p><p>THE U.S. AND PROCLAIMED NORIEGA AS CHIEF OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THESE ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE AS THE REGIME HAS BECOME </p><p>FURTHER ISOLATED INTERNATIONALLY, UNDERSCORED IN NOVEMBER </p><p>BY THE CONDEMNATION OF THE NORIEGA REGIME BY THE GENERAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND THE </p><p>DISINVITATION OF THE PDF FROM THE BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF </p><p>THE AMERICAN ARMIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  BEGIN BACKGROUND: </p><p> </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OPENED FIRE ON A </p><p>CAR CARRYING FOUR U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS IN THE EVENING OF </p><p>DECEMBER 16, KILLING ONE AMERICAN SERVICEMAN AND INJURING </p><p>ANOTHER.  A THIRD U.S. MILITARY OFFICER, WHO WITNESSED </p><p>THE EVENT, WAS DETAINED AND BEATEN BY THE PDF. </p><p> </p><p>EARLIER IN THE EVENING, THE FOUR OFF-DUTY OFFICERS LEFT </p><p>THE U.S. ARMY BASE AT FORT CLAYTON, UNARMED, IN CIVILIAN </p><p>CLOTHING, AND DRIVING IN A PRIVATELY OWNED CAR, HEADING </p><p>FOR DINNER IN A POPULAR DOWNTOWN PANAMA CITY RESTAURANT. </p><p>ON THEIR WAY DOWNTOWN, THEY GOT LOST AND UNINTENTIONALLY </p><p>DROVE ONTO AVENUE A. NEAR THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCE\'S </p><p>HEADQUARTERS INSTEAD OF FOURTH OF JULY AVENUE WHICH </p><p>CONNECTS U.S. MILITARY BASES. </p><p> </p><p>AT 9:05PM  ON DECEMBER 16, PANAMA TIME, THEY CAME TO A PDF </p><p>ROADBLOCK AND WERE STOPPED BY ABOUT FIVE UNIFORMED MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE PDF.  A CROWD OF 30 TO 40 CIVILIANS, SPOTTING THE </p><p>U.S. LICENSE PLATES, SWARMED TOWARD THE CAR.  THE PDF </p><p>MEMBERS REACHED THROUGH THE OPEN CAR WINDOWS, TUGGING AT </p><p>THE SERVICEMEN\'S CLOTHES AND SEAT BELTS, AND OPENED SOME </p><p>OF THE CAR DOORS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PULL THE AMERICANS FROM </p><p>THEIR CAR. </p><p> </p><p>THE FEW CARS AHEAD OF THE AMERICANS AT THE ROADBLOCK WERE </p><p>WAVED ON, AND ONE OF THE U.S. OFFICERS ASKED IN SPANISH </p><p>WHY THE AMERICANS WERE BEING SINGLED OUT.  NO ANSWER WAS </p><p>GIVEN.  THE DRIVER OF THE CAR SAW THAT THE PDF WEAPONS -- </p><p>AK-47\'S AND AUTOMATIC RIFLES - HAD BEEN LOADED AND AIMED </p><p>AT THE AMERICANS.  FEARING FOR THEIR SAFETY, THEY CLOSED </p><p>THE WINDOWS AND DROVE AWAY, PAST THE ROADBLOCK. </p><p> </p><p>AS THE CAR SPED AWAY, PDF SOLDIERS OPENED FIRE ON THE </p><p>AMERICANS.  ONE OF THE U.S. OFFICERS WAS WOUNDED AND </p><p>ANOTHER WAS GRAZED AT THE ANKLE BY A BULLET.  THEY DROVE </p><p>TO GORGAS ARMY HOSPITAL, ABOUT FIVE BLOCKS FROM THE U.S. </p><p>SOUTHERN COMMAND HEADQUARTERS AT QUARRY HEIGHTS, WHERE THE </p><p>WOUNDED OFFICER DIED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER ARRIVING. </p><p>THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED, </p><p>PENDING NOTIFICATION OF THEIR NEXT OF KIN. </p><p> </p><p>A U.S. NAVY LIEUTENANT AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN STOPPED IN </p><p>THEIR CAR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE FOUR OFFICERS </p><p>ARRIVED, AT THE SAME CHECKPOINT ON AVENUE A.  THEY GOT </p><p>LOST AFTER DINING OUT WHILE HEADING HOME TO THE U.S. NAVAL </p><p>STATION AT RODMAN, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE PANAMA CANAL </p><p>NEAR HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE.  PDF SOLDIERS STOPPED THEIR </p><p>CAR, ASKED FOR THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS, AND TOLD THEM </p><p>TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET UNTIL THEIR </p><p>IDENTIFICATION WAS CHECKED. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WAITING IN THE CAR, THE COUPLE SAW THE FOUR </p><p>AMERICANS ARRIVE AND LATER WITNESSED THE PDF SOLDIERS </p><p>RAISE THEIR WEAPONS AND AIM AT OFFICERS\' CAR AS IT STARTED </p><p>TO SPEED AWAY.  THE COUPLE SAID THE PDF THEN BEGAN TO FIRE </p><p>AT THE OFFICERS\' CAR. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER THE SHOOTING, THE PDF MEMBERS RETURNED TO THE </p><p>WAITING NAVY OFFICER AND HIS WIFE.  THEY TOOK THE COUPLE </p><p>TO A NEARBY PDF OFFICE, BLINDFOLDED THEM WITH MASKING </p><p>TAPE, AND DROVE THEM IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK TO </p><p>ANOTHER LOCATION, WHICH THE NAVY OFFICER BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>THE PDF HEADQUARTERS.  THE COUPLE WAS INTERROGATED FOR </p><p>ABOUT FOUR HOURS. </p><p> </p><p>DURING THE QUESTIONING, THE NAVAL OFFICER WAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>BEATEN AND KICKED IN THE GROIN AND HEAD.  HE WAS TOLD HE </p><p>WOULD BE KILLED IF HE DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIS </p><p>DUTIES AND HIS UNIT.  HIS WIFE WAS SLAMMED AGAINST A WALL </p><p>WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HER HEAD WAS CUT.  AFTER STANDING AT </p><p>THE WALL FOR HALF AN HOUR, WITH HER ARMS ABOVE HER HEAD, </p><p>SHE COLLAPSED ONTO THE FLOOR.  SHE WAS ALSO SEXUALLY </p><p>THREATENED BY PDF SOLDIERS. </p><p> </p><p>FOUR HOURS AFTER THEY WERE STOPPED, THE NAVAL OFFICER AND </p><p>HIS WIFE WERE ESCORTED BY THE PDF TO FOURTH OF JULY AVENUE </p><p>THREE BLOCKS AWAY AND RELEASED.  THEY ARRIVED AT THE NAVAL </p><p>SECURITY OFFICE AT RODMAN ABOUT 2:15AM, DECEMBER 17, WHERE </p><p>THEY PROVIDED STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND IMPOSED PERSONNEL MOVEMENT </p><p>LIMITATION "D" ABOUT 9:50PM ON DECEMBER 16, DIRECTING ALL </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THEIR DEPENDENTS TO STAY OUT OF </p><p>PUBLIC AREAS IN PANAMA.  SECURITY AT ALL U.S. MILITARY </p><p>INSTALLATIONS WAS IMMEDIATELY ENHANCED TO ENSURE THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF U.S. PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHERN COMMAND AND U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED </p><p>GRAVE CONCERN OVER THE UNWARRANTED USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY </p><p>THE PDF. </p><p> </p><p>THE PDF\'S PATTERN OF HARRASSMENT OF AMERICANS HAS NOW </p><p>RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A UNITED STATES SERVICEMAN, THE </p><p>BEATING OF A NAVAL OFFICER, AND THE HARASSMENT OF HIS WIFE. </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL NORIEGA HAS NOW BRUTALIZED THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA, </p><p>CRACKED DOWN ON HIS OWN CIVILIANS AND MILITARY ALIKE AFTER </p><p>THE LAST COUP ATTEMPT, DESIGNATED HIMSELF THE LEADER OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AND DECLARED A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE CREATED A CLIMATE OF </p><p>AGGRESSION THAT PUTS AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK.  THIS IS </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>END BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FOR ACTION ADDRESSEES:  IN ORDER TO IMPRESS ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF ACTION ADDRESSEES THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF </p><p>THESE ACTIONS BY THE NORIEGA REGIME, THE SECRETARY HAS </p><p>ASKED THAT ACTION ADDRESSEES MAKE THE DEMARCHE AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
