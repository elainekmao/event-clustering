<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: LAST DITCH EFFORTS TO RESUME PEACE TALKS </p><p>LIKELY TO FAIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1413 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) As reported in reftel, Nepal\'s Maoists have </p><p>established a July 31 deadline for the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GoN) to meet their conditions for a third round of peace </p><p>talks.  Embassy contacts in the police concur with our </p><p>assessment that all the preconditions will not be met, </p><p>thereby seriously imperiling no just the peace dialogue but </p><p>also the cease-fire.  Despite these dire predictions, the GoN </p><p>negotiating team is attempting a last ditch effort to save </p><p>the talks; the team is offering the Maoists the release of </p><p>three Central Committee Members held in Kathmandu\'s central </p><p>jail in exchange for talks.  The offer has been forwarded to </p><p>the Maoist negotiation team through the peace talk </p><p>coordinators.  A Maoist response is expected as early as </p><p>tomorrow, July 30.  The GoN may also request former </p><p>government negotiator, Narayan Singh Pun, to assist in </p><p>reviving the peace talks.  He is expected to return to </p><p>Kathmandu from London tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Kathmandu residents are becoming increasingly </p><p>alarmed by rumors of a Maoist offensive to strike the valley </p><p>after July 31 deadline.  Police sources speculate that </p><p>elements of the Maoist People\'s Liberation Army are actually </p><p>mobilizing in the East and West and that any attack on </p><p>Kathmandu Valley would serve to distract the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  The GoN\'s last-minute efforts will fall </p><p>well short of Maoist demands.  While some in the security </p><p>forces see the benefits of preemptive action against the </p><p>Maoists before the deadline, we believe it unlikely the GoN </p><p>will move to break the cease-fire.  However, our concern that </p><p>the Maoists may strike before July 31 is much higher. </p><p>Security forces, while hopeful peace efforts will succeed, </p><p>continue their elevated defensive posture. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
