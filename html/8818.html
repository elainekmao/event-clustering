<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-18-13 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 92  (06-18-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Joseph L. Novak, Charge d\'Affaires, </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MORE ON AFTERMATH OF LTTE SHIP SINKING </p><p>-          LETTER FROM ASSASSINATED TAMIL POLITICIAN </p><p>-          U.S. NAVY SHIP VISIT </p><p>-          VISA REQUEST FOR PROPOSED SRI LANKAN EMBOFF </p><p> </p><p>MORE ON AFTERMATH OF LTTE SHIP SINKING </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) Just wanted to flag that the situation remains </p><p>relatively quiet in the aftermath of the June 14 sinking </p><p>of the Tiger ship off the northeast coast (Colombo 1061, </p><p>1053).  From what we hear, however, the Tigers remain </p><p>very, very angry over the incident.  Thus far, however, </p><p>the group has confined its reaction to words and not </p><p>taken other measures (that we know of).  Re the incident, </p><p>local newspapers had some articles today (June 18) </p><p>alleging that the navy had not briefed officials in the </p><p>government about the June 14 operation as it was </p><p>happening.  This is what Moragoda mentioned to us (as </p><p>flagged in Colombo 1061) and quite possibly leaked to the </p><p>press subsequently.  We are not sure whether a </p><p>controversy is brewing over this matter and it is not </p><p>clear what, if anything, the PM plans to do about the </p><p>navy\'s apparent insubordination in any case.  By the way, </p><p>re the PM, we understand that the government-controlled </p><p>TV channel will show his opening remarks made at Tokyo </p><p>last week on the evening of June 19 in Sinhala and then </p><p>in English.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>LETTER FROM ASSASSINATED TAMIL POLITICIAN </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) FYI.  We received a letter yesterday (June 17) </p><p>from the Tamil politician who was assassinated in Jaffna </p><p>on June 14 (see Colombo 1053).  In the letter, which was </p><p>apparently a circular of sorts sent out to other local </p><p>missions, T. Subathiran warns about the LTTE and their </p><p>policy of killing of Tamil opponents, and he asks for </p><p>international assistance to stop it.  The letter is </p><p>chilling given what subsequently took place.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>U.S. NAVY SHIP VISIT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3.  (SBU) In one of the irregular visits by the U.S. Navy </p><p>to Sri Lanka, the USS O\'Kane is set to visit Colombo from </p><p>June 20-23.  The O\'Kane is a guided missile destroyer </p><p>with a crew of around 350.  It will be holding a </p><p>reception on board on the evening of June 21 for Sri </p><p>Lankan military officials and Mission personnel. </p><p>(POL/DAO) </p><p> </p><p>VISA REQUEST FOR PROPOSED SRI LANKAN EMBOFF </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU) We sent some e-mails to the desk on the </p><p>following matter and wonder whether it had been looked </p><p>into.  The case involves the following:  A Sri Lankan </p><p>named Llangakoon Adikari came to the Embassy in late May </p><p>for a visa interview with a diplomatic note from the MFA </p><p>that indicated that he would be going to Los Angeles as </p><p>the Public Relations Officer of the Sri Lankan Consulate </p><p>there.  He did not have a diplomatic passport and </p><p>explained that this was due to his being "locally </p><p>recruited."  He had never been to the US as far as could </p><p>be determined.  We called the MFA regarding the </p><p>diplomatic note and it confirmed it was real, but pointed </p><p>out that he was not "home-based" and the Consul General </p><p>in Los Angeles was making this hiring decision.  The </p><p>applicant had no experience in public relations, but did </p><p>appear to have extensive construction and drafting </p><p>training certificates.  Based on discussions with the </p><p>Front Office, a decision was made to make sure this </p><p>posting decision was legitimate by asking SA/INS to check </p><p>with Ambassador Subasinghe.  Could you get back to us </p><p>with any information regarding this matter? -- the MFA is </p><p>knocking on our door.  If Subasinghe thinks this fellow </p><p>is fine for the City of Angels, okay, but it seems a bit </p><p>fishy to us.  Thanks.  (CONS) </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
