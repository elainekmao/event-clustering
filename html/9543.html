<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Dept. for CA/OCS/ACS/PRI, EAP/BCLTV, and EAP/PD </p><p>State also pass to USTR Bryan </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, CJAN, ECON, SOCI, VM, EINV </p><p>SUBJECT: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT AS A GATEWAY TO THE U.S.? </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Recent advertisements carried in local Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City newspapers for a real estate investment opportunity in </p><p>Houston, Texas, attracted significant interest among local </p><p>investors and the local press.  Post interest was aroused by </p><p>implications in the advertisements that this investment would </p><p>allow investors\' children to attend public schools in the U.S., </p><p>and that the Consulate had agreed in advance to notarize all </p><p>documents related to the real estate sales.  Post issued a press </p><p>release widely reported in the local press disavowing any USG </p><p>endorsement or approval of the project and warning potential </p><p>buyers that Vietnamese citizens need student visas to study in the </p><p>U.S.  Post CONS and ECON chiefs sat down with the company\'s </p><p>directors to discuss the misleading nature of the advertisements, </p><p>and to clarify what the ConGen could and could not do in </p><p>connection with visas and notarial services for Vietnamese </p><p>investors.  The company has since printed a retraction of its </p><p>earlier claims and has promised to clarify these issues with all </p><p>potential buyers.  We expect that this is the first of many such </p><p>investments that will be marketed to Vietnam\'s new monied class. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Buying a Piece of America </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2.  In late June, a series of advertisements in local newspapers </p><p>claimed that, for the first time, Vietnamese citizens would be </p><p>allowed to invest in property in the United States.  SEI (Southern </p><p>Investment and Informatics Corporation) Corp. of Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>was offering 86 lots at a cost of USD 35,000 each, in a property </p><p>development near Houston, Texas, under the name Diamond Star. </p><p>Post\'s Public Affairs and ACS units received numerous inquiries </p><p>about the advertisements, drawing our attention to implications </p><p>within the ads that purchase of land in Houston would permit </p><p>owners\' children to attend public school, and that the Consulate </p><p>General had agreed in advance to notarize all the real estate </p><p>contracts.  Aside from the obviously misleading information </p><p>regarding student visas, the implications contained in the ads </p><p>that a special agreement had been reached between the GVN and the </p><p>USG on this project raised concerns that the public might believe </p><p>the USG had in some way endorsed or approved the investment </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>Is This for Real? </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3.  In an effort to obtain details on the real estate investment </p><p>deal, and to correct the misleading information in contained in </p><p>the ads, Post\'s Fraud Prevention Manager contacted an SEI </p><p>official, who responded that all of the information in the </p><p>advertisement was technically correct, if examined from a certain </p><p>point of view, and that SEI had in no way promised buyers that </p><p>they would obtain student visas for their children.  This lack of </p><p>responsiveness on the part of SEI raised further concerns that the </p><p>Diamond Star Project might, in fact, be a scam.  Post\'s FCS office </p><p>contacted the Department of Commerce office in Houston, Texas to </p><p>determine if Diamond Star was a real project with actual real </p><p>property for sale in Houston.  FCS confirmed that Diamond Star was </p><p>a project registered by U.S. Southern Corporation, a wholiy-owned </p><p>subsidiary of SEI. </p><p> </p><p>Post Clarifies Matters and SEI Comes Forward </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>4.  Post issued a press release to local newspapers in response to </p><p>the advertisements and public and press inquiries regarding </p><p>Diamond Star.  In the statement, the Consulate General disavowed </p><p>any USG involvement in real estate deals and unequivocally stated </p><p>that student visas are adjudicated and notarial services are </p><p>provided solely on a case-by-case basis.  The subsequent media </p><p>interest in the case grew as did questions about the bona fides of </p><p>the project, and the directors of SEI Corporation found themselves </p><p>trying to fend off new rumors that they may in fact not be a </p><p>legitimate investment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Upon further investigation of SEI, it became clear that one of </p><p>the main investors of the company was a contact well and favorably </p><p>known to the Econ section.  Mr. Dang Thanh Tam, who owns 25% of </p><p>the company, is also director of a number of successful industrial </p><p>parks in Vietnam.  At our request, he and a director of the </p><p>company, Ms. Chau Ngoc Thi Nguyen met with ECON and CONS chiefs on </p><p>June 30 to clarify their position. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ConGenoffs detailed Post\'s concerns regarding the misleading </p><p>nature of SEI\'s advertisements, as well as our concerns over the </p><p>response of SEI when contacted by our FPM.  CONS chief clarified </p><p>the legal requirements for obtaining a student visa and the </p><p>general circumstances governing notarial services at a U.S. </p><p>Embassy or Consulate.  ECON reiterated that the advertisements </p><p>troubled many of Post\'s staff, particularly the CG, as they led </p><p>readers to believe that the USG somehow endorsed or approved this </p><p>investment opportunity.  He stated that while Post is pleased to </p><p>see increased interest in trade and investment between the U.S. </p><p>and Vietnam, we are not in a position to support any particular </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Ms. Nguyen provided details on the structure of SEI and U.S. </p><p>Southern Corporation, described the real estate investment </p><p>development project in Houston as well as planned future </p><p>developments in Texas and Florida, and apologized for any </p><p>confusion and concern the advertisements caused.  Both SEI </p><p>officials promised to clarify the statements made in the </p><p>advertisement, and promised that advertisements for future </p><p>projects would not make such claims.  Mr. Tam also apologized for </p><p>the advertising and market campaign that he characterized as </p><p>sloppy and misleading.  He stated that this was only one of many </p><p>projects that he was involved in, and as a minority shareholder </p><p>(his sister holds majority share) he had not followed it very </p><p>closely.  He assured us, however, that he would fix whatever </p><p>needed fixing and that he did not want this "small project" to </p><p>damage his reputation. </p><p> </p><p>8. On July 1, SEI forwarded a draft press statement to Post for </p><p>our clearance, correcting the misinformation contained in their </p><p>earlier advertisements and apologizing for any confusion such </p><p>statements may have caused to potential investors.  A few days </p><p>later the Justice Newspaper, widely read in Ho Chi Minh City, ran </p><p>an article based on information from SEI in which SEI apologized </p><p>for its earlier misleading advertisements and made clear that the </p><p>visa issue is separate from any property transaction.  The Saigon </p><p>Times Weekly also ran a letter to the editor from SEI in which it </p><p>also reviewed the same issues.  No further advertisements for </p><p>Diamond Star have appeared in the local press; however, Post </p><p>continues to receive inquiries from member of the local media. </p><p> </p><p>Economics of the Deal </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>9.  Initially press reports indicated that all 86 lots sold out </p><p>within 36 hours of going on sale. As of July 15, however, most of </p><p>those who "registered" to buy a lot have already cancelled.  Five </p><p>buyers in Vietnam have put down 10% deposits, and another ten lots </p><p>have been sold to buyers in the U.S.  It is not clear if potential </p><p>buyers abandoned the project because of the bad publicity,  after </p><p>they became aware that they were only buying land and not the </p><p>right for their children to study in the U.S., or if difficulties </p><p>in actually making the investment interfered with the transaction. </p><p>Mr. Tam correctly noted to Econoff that Vietnam has not yet </p><p>permitted capital to be remitted overseas for property </p><p>investments, but his company is seeking permission.  All of the </p><p>five current potential buyers in Vietnam have family or business </p><p>interests in the United States so they do not face the same </p><p>restrictions.  If this permission to remit funds overseas is not </p><p>granted, it would make the sale of the remainder of the lots much </p><p>more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Comment:  Although it is likely that the implication of easy </p><p>student visas and USG backing was responsible for much of the </p><p>strong initial interest in the Diamond Star lots, it is also </p><p>indicative of a growing moneyed class in Vietnam that would like </p><p>to invest abroad.  Land ownership is a popular investment choice </p><p>among the Vietnamese, and Houston, with its large Vietnamese- </p><p>American community, is a natural site for such development </p><p>projects.  According to SEI, most of their buyers were people with </p><p>relatives already in Houston, people planning to immigrate to the </p><p>area in the near future, and companies whose owners are interested </p><p>in having their children attend school in the U.S.  This case </p><p>clearly illustrates the need for further public outreach regarding </p><p>visa processing as well as general information on the role of the </p><p>USG in daily life.  The case also shows that there is a growing </p><p>class of people here with significant private resources despite </p><p>the poverty reflected in the overall economic statistics for </p><p>Vietnam.   Mr. Tam stated that this is the first of several </p><p>property development projects overseas that SEI plans to market </p><p>primarily to buyers in Vietnam.  End Comment. </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
