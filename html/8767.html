<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 002896 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA AND PRM, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS, THEROUX AND KHALILZAD </p><p>DOD FOR OSD/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: NEED FOR GUIDANCE ON IRAQI PASSPORT ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) AMMAN 3455 </p><p> </p><p>      B) ABU DHABI 2529 </p><p>      C) STATE 100462 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action request; see paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Like our colleagues in Embassy Amman (ref A), Embassy </p><p>officers here have received more than 50 calls and walk-ins </p><p>since the closure of the Iraqi Embassy in Abu Dhabi in early </p><p>June from Iraqi nationals resident in the UAE for assistance </p><p>with consular services and travel to Iraq.  Those who first </p><p>contact the UAEG seeking assistance are now being automatically </p><p>referred to us for help.  We expect that the number of requests </p><p>for assistance will grow exponentially as days pass, given that </p><p>there are reportedly more than 80,000 Iraqis resident in the </p><p>UAE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Our Iraqi callers fear that their inability to renew their </p><p>passports will jeopardize their residency status in the UAE and </p><p>affect their ability to travel abroad, whether for education </p><p>purposes or medical treatment.  The following two cases are </p><p>representative of the urgent requests for assistance that we </p><p>have received: </p><p> </p><p>--An Iraqi engineer resident in the UAE requested assistance </p><p>because his Iraqi passport expires in two months and the UAEG </p><p>will not renew his residency visa unless his passport is valid </p><p>for at least six months.  When his residency visa expires, he </p><p>will become an illegal overstay and lose his employment. </p><p> </p><p>--The Iraqi Office Director to the UAE Minister of Interior </p><p>requested assistance on behalf of his son, whose Iraqi passport </p><p>expired in May.  The son has been studying at a Canadian </p><p>university for three years.  The university refused to enroll </p><p>the Office Director\'s son this summer because his passport had </p><p>expired, and advised him that he will not be allowed to enroll </p><p>this fall for his final year if his passport is not renewed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  We note that our consular section has received at least one </p><p>application for a U.S. visa by an Iraqi citizen holding a </p><p>passport issued after 19 March.  An SAO request was submitted </p><p>pursuant to ref C. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACTION REQUEST:  We request Department guidance at the </p><p>soonest on how we should respond to requests for assistance.  We </p><p>also need guidance that we can pass to the UAEG outlining when </p><p>we expect passport services to resume at the Iraqi Embassy in </p><p>Abu Dhabi.  In the meantime, the Ambassador is seeking the </p><p>assistance of de facto UAE Foreign Minister Hamdan bin Zayid to </p><p>ensure that the Emiratis grant waivers to Iraqi citizen </p><p>residents who are experiencing visa/residency difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
