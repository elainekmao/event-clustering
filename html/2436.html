DESPITE 36 AMENDMENTS, MORE THAN 20 SECTIONS OF THE </p><p>    CONTROVERSIAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF </p><p>    PRIVACY BILL REMAIN UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THIS WAS SAID BY THE </p><p>    CHAIRMAN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE, MR. EDDISON </p><p>    ZVOBGO (ZANU PF, MASVINGO SOUTH), IN PARLIAMENT ON JANUARY </p><p>    29 WHEN HE PRESENTED AN ADVERSE REPORT WHICH DECLARED THAT </p><p>    MOST OF THE CLAUSES IN THE AMENDED BILL INFRINGED THE </p><p>    CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY SECTION 20 ON THE FREEDOM OF </p><p>    EXPRESSION.  "THE BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS THE MOST </p><p>    CALCULATED AND DETERMINED ASSAULT ON OUR LIBERTIES </p><p>    GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN THE 20 YEARS I SERVED AS </p><p>    CABINET MINISTER AND AS A MEMBER OF THE CABINET COMMITTEE </p><p>    ON LEGISLATION FOR 16 OF THOSE YEARS.  WHAT IS WORSE, THE </p><p>    BILL WAS BADLY DRAFTED IN THAT SEVERAL PROVISIONS WERE </p><p>    OBSCURE, VAGUE, ILL CONCEIVED AND DANGEROUS," ZVOBGO TOLD </p><p>    PARLIAMENT.  ALTHOUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, MR. ANDREW </p><p>    CHIGOVERA, DEFENDED SOME OF THE CLAUSES SAYING THEY WERE </p><p>    CONSTITUTIONAL AND JUSTIFIABLE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, </p><p>    BOTH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND JUSTICE, LEGAL AND </p><p>    PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA ALSO </p><p>    CONCEDED SOME OF THE PROVISIONS WERE POSITIVELY </p><p>    UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>    PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE ARE EXPECTED TO MEET THIS </p><p>    MORNING (JANUARY 30) TO RESOLVE THE DEADLOCK BY DISCUSSING </p><p>    THEIR CONCERNS AND POSSIBLY COME UP WITH FURTHER AMENDMENTS </p><p>    FOR DEBATE WHEN PARLIAMENT MEETS IN THE AFTERNOON. </p><p> </p><p>2.   EXCERPTS FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>    REPORT FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>    ". . .THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS MANIFESTLY </p><p>    UNCONSTITUTIONAL. . .I CAN SAY WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION SAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00287  311906Z </p><p>    THAT, THIS BILL, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS THE MOST </p><p>    CALCULATED AND DETERMINED ASSAULT ON OUR LIBERTIES </p><p>    GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION, IN THE 20 YEARS I </p><p>    SERVED AS CABINET MINISTER AND AS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>    CABINET COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION FOR 16 YEARS OF THOSE </p><p>    YEARS.  WHAT IS WORSE, THE BILL WAS BADLY DRAFTED IN </p><p>    THAT SEVERAL PROVISIONS WERE \'OBSCURE, VAGUE, OVER- </p><p>    BROAD IN SCOPE, ILL-CONCEIVED AND DANGEROUS.\'  YOUR </p><p>    COMMITTEE EXPRESSES ITS GRATITUDE TO THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>    HOUSE. . .HONORABLE PATRICK CHINAMASA, FOR HIS </p><p>    UNSTINTING HEROISM, THROUGH AMENDMENTS, TO GIVE THIS </p><p>    BILL A HUMAN FACE.  WE APPLAUD THE EFFORT AS HIS </p><p>    MINISTRY WAS ABLE TO AMEND, REPEAL, RE-WORD SEVERAL </p><p>    PROVISIONS, WHICH WERE BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  IT </p><p>    IS A MATTER FOR REGRET THAT SOME UNCONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>    PROVISIONS STILL REMAIN.  IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT </p><p>    THE BILL REMAINS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE MOST OFFENDING </p><p>    CLAUSES ARE 14, 37, 40, 47, 52, 54, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, </p><p>    72, 73, 74, 75, 77, 80, 82, 86, AND 93.  AT STAKE ARE </p><p>    THE PROTECTIONS OF ZIMBABWEANS ENSHRINED IN SECTIONS </p><p>    16, 18 AND 20 OF THE CONSTITUTION. . .YOUR COMMITTEE </p><p>    CONSIDERS THAT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN </p><p>    ADVERSE REPORT.  WE ARE NOT A COURT OF LAW.  IF IT </p><p>    PLEASES THE HOUSE TO OVERRIDE OUR REPORT, WE WILL </p><p>    REMAIN COMFORTED IN THE VIEW THAT WE DISCHARGED OUR </p><p>    BURDEN TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
