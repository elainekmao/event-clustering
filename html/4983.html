<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE AND PM; OSD FOR DASD BRZEZINSKI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, GR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT PROTESTS PORT VISIT BY US NAVY TO RHODES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown. Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Embassy recently received a diplomatic note from </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding visits by US Naval </p><p>vessels to the island of Rhodes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Begin text of MFA note No. 2002DHGY/485435: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey </p><p>presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States </p><p>of America and has the honor to bring the following to the </p><p>kind attention of the Embassy: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry has been informed that two MK V type American </p><p>naval boats visited the island of Rhodes on 4 November, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry would like to emphasize that Rhodes and other </p><p>Dodecanese islands have been placed under a permanent </p><p>demilitarized status by the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty which </p><p>excludes all forms of military presence and activities on the </p><p>said islands, including port visits by naval ships. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry would therefore like to request the US </p><p>Administration to abide by the regime enshrined in the 1947 </p><p>Paris Peace Treaty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign affairs of the Republic of Turkey </p><p>avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of </p><p>the United States of America the assurance of its highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara, 17 December 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  The MFA\'s position as described in the </p><p>diplomatic note is consistent with the long-standing GOT </p><p>position on port calls by US ships to Rhodes and other </p><p>islands that the GOT considers de-militarized.  MFA and TGS </p><p>officials most recently raised this issue during the Dec </p><p>16-18 High-Level Defense Group (HLDG) Political-Military </p><p>Working Group meeting in Garmisch, Germany, and we expect </p><p>them to raise it again during the HLDG meeting in the US in </p><p>May 2003. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
