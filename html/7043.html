<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001212 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP, IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ASEC, MOPS, PGOV, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT TO UMM QASR BY ORHA DIRECTOR AND SENIOR STAFF </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON:  1.5 (A) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ORHA Director Lt. Gen. Jay Garner (ret.), </p><p>accompanied by ORHA senior staff, visited the liberated Iraqi </p><p>port city of Umm Qasr  on April 1.  The ORHA team met with </p><p>the commanding officers of the British forces holding both </p><p>the port facilities and the town.  The port and associated </p><p>rail line are in relatively good shape; the town is in a </p><p>highly degraded condition, due more to grinding poverty and </p><p>recent looting than to military action.  British officers </p><p>reported success in standing up the port\'s freight-handling </p><p>facilities and restoring electric power and drinking water to </p><p>the town.  The entire local administrative and government </p><p>apparatus in Umm Qasr has dissolved, as local Baath officials </p><p>have fled the town to avoid revenge and retaliation by </p><p>citizens venting their fury.  The inhabitants suspect that </p><p>coalition forces will not in fact stay the course, fear that </p><p>the Baathist regime will survive in the end, and are </p><p>consequently terrified of retaliation from the regime\'s </p><p>security forces, should they opt to cooperate with coalition </p><p>forces.  There has been no violence between Sunni and Shi\'ite </p><p>believers in the town, and both mosques are functioning </p><p>normally.  ORHA leadership is considering deploying a team to </p><p>Umm Qasr within a week to begin operations inside liberated </p><p>Iraq.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>2. (U) The Road to Umm Qasr: ORHA Director Garner and members </p><p>of his senior staff visited the liberated Iraqi town of Umm </p><p>Qasr (population: 20,000)  on the Shatt al-Arab on April 1, </p><p>in the company of British General Albert Whitley.  British </p><p>General Timothy Cross, a member of the ORHA senior staff, </p><p>took part in the trip, as well as State Department Officer </p><p>Michael Gfoeller and British Foreign Office representative </p><p>Simon Elvy.  The trip from Kuwait City to the border was </p><p>uneventful, as was the border crossing.  Numerous military </p><p>vehicles were in evidence, including coalition convoys </p><p>guarded by heavy machine guns.  The obviously peaceful border </p><p>zone was full of large herds of sheep and camels accompanied </p><p>by Beduin herdsmen. </p><p>3. (U) Progress in the Port: The ORHA team was briefed by </p><p>three senior British officers: the commander of joint force </p><p>logistics for Umm Qasr, Brigadier General Sean Cowlam, the </p><p>commander of the 17th Port and Maritime Regiment, Lt. Col. </p><p>Paul Ash, and the comMander of the Royal Marines in Umm Qasr, </p><p>Col. Steven Cox.   According to them, British forces have </p><p>succeeded in clearing most of the port area of mines.  The </p><p>entire area, including both the old and new ports and the </p><p>town, are firmly in coalition hands.  In the old port, berths </p><p>5 through 10 have been repaired, as have all berths in the </p><p>new port.  A superficial examination of the new port revealed </p><p>an apparently operational facility, currently hosting a large </p><p>coalition military presence.  The Shatt al-Arab channel, </p><p>however, is silting up, since dredging operations have been </p><p>reduced sharply since the start of the war.  Before the war, </p><p>it took eight dredging vessels working 24-hours a day to keep </p><p>the channel clear; only two dredgers are in service now. </p><p>Coalition forces are planning to bring in more from Kuwait. </p><p>The local rail line lis undamaged, according to coalition </p><p>officers. </p><p>4. (U) Water and Electricity Restored: Coalition officers </p><p>reported that they restored electricity to 75 percent of the </p><p>town two days ago.  The power comes from a local generator </p><p>bank. The voltage, normally 220 volts, is at present only 180 </p><p>volts.  The local population therefore has light, but cannot </p><p>operate such devices as air conditioners or electric motors. </p><p> A 2.5 kilometer pipeline has been run from Kuwait to a point </p><p>just inside the city and the Iraqi border, to a location in </p><p>the old UN compound.  Tanker trucks are filled there with </p><p>drinking water, at no charge.  The truck drivers then sell </p><p>the water to city residents for 25 Iraqi dinars per liter. </p><p>This arrangement has mitigated the formerly extreme lack of </p><p>water in the town.  That said, water is "liquid gold" in Umm </p><p>Qasr, according to the British forces there, and the drinking </p><p>water terminal at the UN compound is heavily fortified to </p><p>prevent rioting.  It is surrounded by a 12-foot fence topped </p><p>by razor wire and guarded by heavy machine guns in sandbag </p><p>emplacements and numerous troops.  Iraqis in ragged clothing </p><p>could be observed just beyond the fence, holding empty water </p><p>cans. </p><p>5. (U) The Local Administration Melts Away: State officer and </p><p>Foreign Office representative Elvy spoke with two local </p><p>inhabitants, both middle class professionals, who have </p><p>stepped forward along with several other residents to </p><p>cooperate with the British forces.   They explained that the </p><p>entire government administrative apparatus in Umm Qasr </p><p>dissolved as soon as the coalition forces moved in.  The </p><p>entire 40-man police force deserted, both officers and </p><p>rank-and-file policemen, and at present there are no local </p><p>police in the town.  The rest of the government </p><p>administration collapsed as well.  Nearly all Baath officials </p><p>in Umm Qasr fled to Basra to avoid falling prey to acts of </p><p>revenge by the citizenry. </p><p>6.  (U) Omnipresent Poverty: The town in fact seemed full of </p><p>impoverished people wandering aimlessly.  There was no </p><p>organized market in evidence, although individuals could be </p><p>observed selling drinking water by the side of the road. </p><p>There were many beggars, mostly children. Though obviously </p><p>poor, the population did appear adequately fed.  There is no </p><p>shortage of grain locally, though meat and milk are in short </p><p>supply.   Asked by ORHA staffers what level of salary would </p><p>enable a local person to survive in an austere fashion, they </p><p>replied that $50 per month is the minimum, while $100 per </p><p>month would allow a more comfortable existence, if hardly an </p><p>affluent one.  They stressed the fact that the local economy </p><p>is at a standstill and will remain so until the port reopens. </p><p>7.  (C) Terror of the Regime: The local citizens with whom </p><p>ORHA officials spoke said that coalition forces should expect </p><p>similar scenarios to develop as further towns are secured. </p><p>The hatred of the local population for Baathist officials is </p><p>so extreme that they will try to take vengeance on them, once </p><p>the party\'s power has been broken.  The regime is striking </p><p>back, they noted, by deploying members of many different </p><p>security agencies: the Saddam Fedayeen, the Security Forces, </p><p>the Special Security Forces, etc.  Members of these forces </p><p>can infiltrate themselves easily into coalition-held </p><p>territory, the local residents said, since they operate in </p><p>civilian attire.  Such elements operating out of Basra have </p><p>free access to Umm Qasr, they noted.   "The road to Basra is </p><p>open," one resident said.  A resident who has cooperated </p><p>actively with coalition forces reported that he has received </p><p>death threats, and in fact he appeared deeply terrified by </p><p>the possibility that he would soon be killed in retaliation </p><p>for cooperating with the coalition. </p><p>8. (C) The local residents added that the population of Umm </p><p>Qasr is largely unwilling to cooperate openly with the </p><p>coalition because they are gripped by terror.  People doubt </p><p>that the US and the coalition have the staying power to </p><p>achieve a final victory over the Baathist regime, and they </p><p>fear that Saddam will somehow survive in the end and return </p><p>to take vengeance on them if they work with us.  This fear </p><p>can be reduced only once coalition forces take Basra, and it </p><p>can be eliminated only after Baghdad has fallen, they said. </p><p> Nevertheless, the British forces have succeeded in hiring </p><p>120 local men to work in the port, at rates of pay varying </p><p>from $3 to $5 per day.  Some 60 men reportedly refused to </p><p>work in the port because they were warned not to by the Iraqi </p><p>security services. </p><p>9. (C) Comment:  It is impossible to overstate the extent to </p><p>which the local population in Umm Qasr still fears the </p><p>regime.  The terror felt by local residents reminded the </p><p>State officer present, who served several tours in Eastern </p><p>Europe and the former Soviet Union, of the deep fear Soviet </p><p>citizens once had of the KGB.  Overcoming this psychological </p><p>obstacle to re-establishing normal governance in Umm Qasr </p><p>will require several things, further progress on the </p><p>battlefield chief among them.  Once Basra is firmly in </p><p>coalition hands, people in Umm Qasr and other towns and </p><p>cities across Iraq will probably take heart and begin to </p><p>believe that the regime will actually fall this time, and </p><p>their readiness to work with us may well rise then.  The </p><p>implementation of relief and recovery operations will also </p><p>boost confidence.  The local inhabitants with whom ORHA staff </p><p>spoke may represent hope for the future.  They and others </p><p>like them will gradually emerge to take over the reins of </p><p>governance, Deo volente.  While inexperienced, many of them </p><p>will be largely untainted by the Baathist regime.  The </p><p>challenge will be to work with such people and the surviving </p><p>elements of the bureaucracy to re-establish order and lay a </p><p>foundation for a democratic future in Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
