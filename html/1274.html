FROM AMBASSADOR MCDONALD TO AF DAS SCHNEIDMAN, AND </p><p>AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER:  I WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05051  01 OF 02  111542Z </p><p>YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE AT YOUR EARLIEST </p><p>CONVENIENCE.  WE NEED TO COME TO SOME CONSENSUS </p><p>QUICKLY ON TERMINATING THIS PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p>2. DONORS INVOLVED IN THE UNDP/TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT </p><p>(TSU) LAND REFORM SUPPORT ACTIVITY, INCLUDING THE </p><p>U.S., NORWAY, SWEDEN, AND THE NETHERLANDS, MET ON </p><p>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5 AT UNDP WITH ACTING UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE (RESREP) CHINWE TO DISCUSS THE STATUS </p><p>AND RECOMMENDED DISPOSITION OF THIS ACTIVITY GIVEN THE </p><p>CONTINUING ILLEGAL FARM OCCUPATIONS AND ASSOCIATED </p><p>PROBLEMS.  NOTE:  ALTHOUGH NOT A CONTRIBUTING DONOR TO </p><p>THIS SPECIFIC ACTIVITY, GIVEN THEIR CLOSE ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH THIS PROGRAM, A WORLD BANK REPRESENTATIVE ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED THIS MEETING.  END NOTE.  SEE REFTEL A FOR A </p><p>FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THIS MULTI-DONOR LAND REFORM </p><p>SUPPORT PROJECT ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. PER REFTEL B, THIS ACTIVITY WAS OFFICIALLY \'FROZEN\' </p><p>(I.E., NO NEW FUNDING COMMITMENTS) AFTER DONOR AND </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT CONSULTATIONS IN MARCH 2000.  A </p><p>LETTER WAS SENT TO THE GOZ OULY REFLECTING THIS </p><p>DECISION.  NOTE:  TO DATE, WE HAVE RECEIVED NO </p><p>RESPONSE FROM THE GOZ TO THIS \'FREEZE\' </p><p>LETTER/DECISION.  END NOTE.  AS A RESULT, THE PROJECT </p><p>HAS ONLY BEEN PAYING SALARIES OF RECRUITED TSU STAFF </p><p>SINCE THAT TIME, AS NO ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT </p><p>OR OPERATING COSTS ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE SUSPENSION </p><p>OR FREEZE.  ACCORDINGLY, EXACERBATED BY THE MORE </p><p>RECENT DRAMATIC AOVERSE TURN OF IN-COUNTRY EVENTS, TSU </p><p>STAFF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH LITTLE OF THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05051  01 OF 02  111542Z </p><p>EXPECTED SCOPE OF WORK SINCE MARCH 2000.  RESREP </p><p>CHINWE ALSO INFORMED THE MEETING THAT THERE WAS NEED </p><p>FOR A TIMELY DECISION IN THIS MATTER AS, GIVEN ITS </p><p>CURRENT LOCATION WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND CABINET, THE TSU IS COMING UNDER INCREASING </p><p>PRESSURE FROM THE GOZ TO USE THEIR EQUIPMENT AND STAFF </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S \'FAST-TRACK\' PROGRAM </p><p>WHICH THE DONORS DO NOT SUPPORT IN ITS CURRENT FORM. </p><p> </p><p>4. CONSIDERING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THE CURRENT </p><p>BLEAK PROSPECTS FOR ANY RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN THIS </p><p>SITUATION, ALL DONORS TO THIS PROGRAM RECOMMEND THAT </p><p>IT IS BEST TO \'CUT OUR LOSSES\' AT THIS TIME, AND </p><p>TERMINATE OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. LESS DRASTIC OPTIONS DISCUSSED (E.G., RETAINING </p><p>SOME MODIFIED SEMBLANCE OF THIS ACTIVITY FOR SUPPORT </p><p>OF ON-GOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES WITH </p><p>REMAINING PROJECT FUNDS, SUCH AS MONITORING OF ON- </p><p>GOING ZIMBABWE LAND REFORM ACTIVITIES/EVENTS, </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE TECHNICAL STUDIES, AND/OR FACILITATION OF </p><p>A DONOR-GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE ON THIS SUBJECT) WERE </p><p>REJECTED DUE TO THE FORMAL NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT FOR </p><p>THIS ACTIVITY BETWEEN THE UNDP AND THE GOZ REQUIRING </p><p>THAT ANY/ALL SUCH MODIFIED USES OF PROJECT RESOURCES </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO APPROVED BY THE GOZ.  UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IN THE INTEREST OF MAINTAINING A </p><p>DESIRED DEGREE OF AUTONOMY AND FLEXIBILITY VIS-A-VIS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S EXPRESSED PLANS AND ACTIONS ON THIS </p><p>SUBJECT, ALL PRESENT AGREED THAT IT WAS BEST TO </p><p>TERMINATE THIS ACTIVITY ALTOGETHER.  THEREAFTER, ONCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05051  01 OF 02  111542Z </p><p>WE HAVE A CLEARER IDEA WHERE THE \'FAST-TRACK\' PROGRAM </p><p>IS GOING AND WHAT OUR POSSIBLE STRATEGIC POINTS OF </p><p>ENTRY MIGHT BE, A NEW PROGRAM COULD BE DEVELOPED. </p><p>NOTE: IN THIS LATTER REGARD, THE MISSION NOTES THAT </p><p>THE U.S.G. WILL RETAIN THE CAPABILITY FOR SUCH ON- </p><p>GOING TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWE LAND REFORM, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL STATUS OF THIS MULTI-DONOR </p><p>UNDP/TSU ACTIVITY, UNDER OUR SEPARATE, COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>AND DIRECT AGREEMENT WITH THE UNVIERSITY OF </p><p>WISCONSIN\'S LAND TENURE CENTER (SEE REFTEL A). </p><p> </p><p>6. NEXT STEPS: </p><p> </p><p>-A. AFTER DONOR CONCURRENCE, UNOP WILL DRAFT A FORMAL </p><p>LETTER TO GOVERNMENT INDICATING OUR OECISION TO </p><p>TERMINATE OUR SUPPORT UNDER THIS ACTIVITY.  NOTE: IT </p><p>WAS AGREED AT THIS MEETING THAT THIS DRAFT LETTER </p><p>WOULD BE CLEARED BY ALL CONCERNED PARTIES PRIOR TO </p><p>FINALIZATION/TRANSMITTAL.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>-B.

IN THE INTERIM, PARTICIPATING DONORS WILL CONSIDER </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY/INTEREST IN CONTINUING TO SUPPORT SOME </p><p>TYPE OF SUCCESSOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) ACTIVITY </p><p>WITH REMAINING PROJECT FUNDS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>7. ONCE THESE STEPS ARE COMPLETE, THE DONORS WILL MEET </p><p>AGAIN TO FINALIZE OUR RESPECTIVE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS </p><p>AND CLOSE-OUT PROCEDURES UNOER THE EXISTING ACTIVITY, </p><p>AND TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF ANY SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSOR ACTIVITY. </p><p>8. COMMENT: FOR THE SEVERAL REASONS STATED ABOVE, </p><p>EMBASSY BELIEVES THIS ACTIVITY TERMINATION DECISION IS </p><p>THE CORRECT ONE AT THIS TIME.  ALL OTHER DONORS </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN THIS ACTIVITY CLEARLY SUPPORT THE </p><p>NECESSITY FOR THIS ACTION AT THIS TIME.  IN THE </p><p>PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, AT BEST, WE ARE SIMPLY WASTING </p><p>MONEY BY CONTINUING TO FUND THE TSU; AND, AT WORST, WE </p><p>COULD SEE OUR RESOURCES CO-OPTED TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CURRENT ILLEGAL \'FAST-TRACK\' LAND REFORM </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH A FINAL ACCOUNTING </p><p>IS YET TO BE COMPLETED, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT, AT MOST, </p><p>WE HAVE US$100,000 TO 150,000 OF U.S.G. FUNDS </p><p>REMAINING UNDER THIS ACTIVITY AT THIS TIME. </p><p>THEREFORE, EVEN IF WE OPTED TO \'GO IT ALONE\', WE COULD </p><p>ACCOMPLISH LITTLE ON OUR OWN WITHOUT THE CONTINUING </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF THE OTHER THREE DONORS TO THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY.  FINALLY, IT IS NOTEO THAT THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE MERIT TO MAINTAINING A UNITED OONOR FRONT </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE.  HOWEVER, AS THE TERMINATION LETTER TO </p><p>THE GOZ IS ONLY BEING ORAFTED NOW, WE WILL HAVE TIME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05051  02 OF 02  111543Z </p><p>TO RECONSIOER THIS OECISION BEFORE IT BECOMES FINAL, </p><p>IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING IN NEW YORK (UNGA) </p><p>MERIT SUCH A RECONSIDERATION.  NOTE: THE UNDP HAS </p><p>SINCE CALLED AN INFORMAL DONORS MEETING FOR THIS WEEK </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE RECENT UNGA DELIBERATIONS AND THEIR </p><p>POSSIBLE IMPACT ON THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.  FURTHER </p><p>POST NOTES DAS SCHEIDMAN\'S DISCUSSION LAST WEEK WITH </p><p>THE DIRECTOR OF UNDP.  END NOTE.  MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
