<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 04875 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356 DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KU, </p><p>SUBJECT: TFKU01: CHEESEBURGERS AS SYMBOLS OF RESISTANCE; WATER AS A </p><p>WEAPON OF WAR </p><p> </p><p>1.  CANADIAN EMBASSY LAST NIGHT, AUGUST 27, LEARNED IN A MOST </p><p>TANGIBLE WAY OF THE STRENGTH OF THE KUWAIT RESISTANCE, AND THE </p><p>IMPACT EMBASSIES\' DEFIANCE OF IRAQI ORDERS TO CLOSE HAS HAD ON THE </p><p>LOCAL KUWAITI POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN THE LATE EVENING, THE SMALL BAND OF CANADIAN DIPLOMATS SEALED </p><p>INTO THEIR EMBASSY HEARD ROCKS BEING PELTED AT THEIR WINDOWS. </p><p>FEARING THE WORST -- THE MUCH RUMORED RENT-A-MOBS -- THEY GINGERLY </p><p>LOOKED OUT THEIR WINDOWS.  THERE, ON THE SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THEIR </p><p>CHANCERY, WERE TWO VERY FRIGHTENED KUWAITI BOYS.  IN THEIR HANDS </p><p>WERE A PLATTER OF CHEESEBURGERS, PICKLES, A CASE OF SODAS AND A </p><p>COOLER OF ICE.  AS THEY PLACED THE FOOD DOWN BY THE GATE, THEY </p><p>SHOUTED OUT "THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STAYING", AND SCAMPERED OFF.  A </p><p>FEW MINUTES LATER, ANOTHER YOUNG, SCARED BOY CAME TO THE GATE, </p><p>PUSHED A BOX OF TABLE CANDLES THROUGH, AND RAN OFF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CHEESEBURGERS BY CANDLELIGHT WILL NOT END THE IRAQI OCCUPATION </p><p>OF KUWAIT.  THE WILLINGNESS OF THESE THREE BOYS, AND THEIR FAMILIES, </p><p>TO DEFY THE SEALING (THE CANADIANS ARE NOT AS GUARDED AS OTHERS) BY </p><p>BRINGING FOOD AND LIGHT IS, HOWEVER, A SIGN THAT THE KUWAITIS HAVE </p><p>NOT GIVEN UP YET, AND SEE OUR COLLECTIVE DIPLOMATIC WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>TOUGH IT OUT ON THEIR BEHALF AS A PORTENT THAT KUWAIT WILL </p><p>ULTIMATELY PREVAIL.  THE HAMBURGERS WERE EVEN HOT AND PROPERLY DONE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A LATER CONVERSATION, CANADIAN CHARGE INFORMED US THAT IN THE </p><p>COURSE OF THE MORNING, THE IRAQIS HAD RETURNED TO HIS CHANCERY AND </p><p>DUG A LARGE DITCH, THEREBY PERMANENTLY CUTTING OFF THEIR WATER. </p><p>BOWDEN ASSURES US (AND WOULD LIKE HIS GOVERNMENT INFORMED) THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE AMPLE SUPPLIES.  BOWDEN WOULD LIKE INFORMATION WE CAN PASS TO </p><p>HIM ON WHAT OTTAWA IS DOING TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE IRAQI EMBASSY </p><p>THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
