<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 001299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARRARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETRD, SNAR, PHUM, KDEM, EAID, ELAB, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT PORTILLO DISCUSSES CAFTA, PEACE ACCORDS, </p><p>COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION AND LABOR RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  In a May 14 breakfast at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>residence with visiting senior USG officials, President </p><p>Portillo expressed hope for the prompt conclusion of a free </p><p>trade agreement with the U.S. which, he said, "will transform </p><p>Guatemala;" said that in his remaining months in office he </p><p>would seek Congressional passage of laws implementing the </p><p>peace accords in order to "ensure the accords remain a </p><p>priority for the next government" and prevent a new </p><p>administration from rolling back reforms; and noted that he </p><p>hoped Guatemala\'s increased counter-narcotics cooperation </p><p>would lead to an early USG decision to "re-certify" to reduce </p><p>the chances that this issue would influence the upcoming </p><p>national elections.  Portillo and Minister of Finance Weymann </p><p>spoke of the need for constitutional reform in order to </p><p>modernize tax laws and implement many elements of the peace </p><p>accords.  The Ambassador and senior Washington visitors told </p><p>Portillo that, through trade capacity building programs, we </p><p>will help the GOG prepare their most disadvantaged economic </p><p>sectors to participate effectively in CAFTA; stressed the </p><p>importance of making concrete advances in implementation of </p><p>the peace accords in the next eight months; and expressed </p><p>hope that the GOG would initial a maritime counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation agreement in the next few days, increasing the </p><p>likelihood of an early inter-agency review of Guatemala\'s </p><p>decertification as a cooperating partner in the war on drugs. </p><p> The meeting was cordial and reaffirmed President Portillo\'s </p><p>desire to advance issues of interest to us in the remaining </p><p>months of his presidency.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On May 14, the Ambassador hosted a breakfast at the </p><p>Residence for visiting USG officials to discuss CAFTA, Peace </p><p>Accord implementation, counter-narcotics cooperation and </p><p>labor rights with President Alfonso Portillo.  Portillo was </p><p>accompanied by Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgar Gutierrez </p><p>and Minister of Finance Eduardo Weymann.  The Ambassador was </p><p>accompanied by Assistant USTR Regina Vargo, USAID Assistant </p><p>Administrator for LAC Adolfo Franco, Deputy Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State for INL Deborah McCarthy, Acting Deputy </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Undersecretary of Labor Jorge Perez-Lopez, WHA/CEN Guatemala </p><p>Desk Officer Brian Wilson, Acting USAID Guatemala Director </p><p>Deborah Kennedy-Iraheta, EconCouns Steve Olson, and PolCouns </p><p>David Lindwall (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>Bullish on Free Trade </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>3. (C) President Portillo opened the meeting by saying his </p><p>government believes a free trade agreement with the United </p><p>States will transform Guatemala, not only by creating jobs </p><p>and generating economic growth, but also by modernizing and </p><p>opening up the economy.  Portillo said he expects Guatemala\'s </p><p>Congress to overwhelmingly approve the final agreement, </p><p>noting that "only a handful of legislators from the left" </p><p>will oppose it.  He noted that some in the private sector and </p><p>civil society will oppose CAFTA based on their own parochial </p><p>interests and fundamental misunderstandings of how it will </p><p>work, but said that opposition will not be significant. </p><p>Portillo noted that it will be important to work with sectors </p><p>of the economy that will be disadvantaged by CAFTA -- </p><p>specifically mentioning small farmers -- to prepare them to </p><p>better compete.  He acknowledged that CAFTA will not </p><p>transform Guatemala overnight, but heralded it as the best </p><p>hope for bringing Guatemala\'s economy into the 21st century. </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez added that CAFTA will break the </p><p>monopolies that have long dominated Guatemala\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) USAID Franco said that the USG is prepared to help </p><p>disadvantaged sectors of the Central American economies </p><p>prepare for CAFTA, and has established a fund for trade </p><p>capacity building focused largely on small enterprise and the </p><p>rural sector.  He added that USAID is currently working in </p><p>Guatemala on agricultural diversification in response to the </p><p>coffee crisis.  He noted that the success of CAFTA would </p><p>depend to a large extent on GOG actions to increase </p><p>transparency and to improve the administration of justice. </p><p>USTR Vargo commented that customs rules in Central America </p><p>need to be uniform and transparent in order for Central </p><p>American economic integration to also benefit from CAFTA. </p><p>Finance Minister Weymann acknowledged that Guatemala\'s </p><p>customs procedures are in great need of reform, and blamed </p><p>the zeal of the tax authority (SAT) for much of the current </p><p>lack of transparency in customs operations (Comment: Weymann </p><p>has recently been trying to distance himself from the SAT, </p><p>which reports to him.  He appears to be signalling that Vice </p><p>President Reyes, not he, is the one who condones some of the </p><p>SAT\'s heavy handed tactics. End comment).  President Portillo </p><p>interjected that despite major reforms in customs, tax </p><p>evasion at the port of entry is still on the order of 45%. </p><p>Minister Weymann said that, in terms of USG trade capacity </p><p>building programs, he believes reforming the way Central </p><p>Americans market their products is just as important as </p><p>modernizing production. </p><p> </p><p>Using the Consultative Group to Move Peace Process Forward </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador told President Portillo that we have </p><p>firm expectations that the Consultative Group Meeting (which </p><p>met in Guatemala on May 13-14) would lead to a GOG plan of </p><p>concrete actions which would implement many remaining Peace </p><p>Accord commitments during the last eight months of the </p><p>Portillo Administration.  The Ambassador praised the IDB\'s </p><p>leadership of the meetings, and said we would consider the CG </p><p>a success if it produced a package of specific areas for </p><p>short-term compliance.  He expressed disappointment that the </p><p>political parties had used their fifteen minutes at the CG to </p><p>attack the government, but did not offer a vision on how they </p><p>would implement the accords, leaving the impression that the </p><p>political parties are not making peace accord implementation </p><p>an important component of their electoral platforms. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Foreign Minister Gutierrez blamed civil society and </p><p>the opposition for "self-fulfilling prophecies of failure" of </p><p>the accords, noting that both played an important role in </p><p>implementing the accords.  He said that the Portillo </p><p>Government\'s big challenge in its remaining months was </p><p>ensuring that peace accord implementation "survives the </p><p>transition to a new government."  President Portillo said </p><p>that he had implemented many of the accords through </p><p>presidential decrees, which could easily be undone by a new </p><p>government.  He intends to consolidate much of the </p><p>implementation to date by having Congress pass laws </p><p>implementing the reforms, making it more difficult for a new </p><p>government to change them.  Minister of Finance Weymann </p><p>commented that it is particularly important to resume </p><p>implementation of the fiscal pact, noting that several of the </p><p>candidates in the upcoming election are already talking about </p><p>dropping taxes in possible violation of the peace accord </p><p>commitment to raise tax revenue to 12% of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) President Portillo launched into an impassioned </p><p>defense of the need for constitutional reform, saying that </p><p>the current constitution had been "made to order" by the </p><p>different interest groups that held sway at the time of its </p><p>drafting (1985).  He said constitutional provisions affecting </p><p>financial and fiscal laws stand in the way of genuine </p><p>economic reform and create a drag on implementing the peace </p><p>accords.  In response to questions regarding what mechanism </p><p>he would use to reform the constitution (i.e. through a vote </p><p>in Congress, ratified by a national referendum or by a </p><p>constituent assembly), Portillo said that previous attempts </p><p>to reform the constitution by Congress had been voted down </p><p>when submitted to a national referendum.  Therefore, he </p><p>believes the only way to achieve constitutional reform is </p><p>through a constituent assembly.  He acknowledged that opening </p><p>up the whole constitution for reform, as would happen if a </p><p>constituent assembly were convoked, had its perils, but said </p><p>he is considering calling for a constituent assembly to meet </p><p>after the first round of elections (November 9, 2003) to </p><p>minimize potential politicization (Note:  Guatemala\'s </p><p>constitution requires that Congress convoke constituent </p><p>assemblies by a two-thirds majority vote, a virtual </p><p>impossibility without significant consensus among all </p><p>parties. End note). </p><p> </p><p>The Path Ahead on Counter-Narcotics Cooperation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>8. (C) INL DAS McCarthy said that recent improvements in GOG </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation were encouraging, and said that </p><p>the U.S. would look to Guatemala to initial a maritime </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation agreement before we would </p><p>consider proposing an early decision on "re-certifying" </p><p>Guatemala.  Foreign Minister Gutierrez acknowledged the </p><p>importance of a maritime agreement, and said his Ministry had </p><p>provided a counter-proposal to us "in record time."  He </p><p>welcomes our comments on their counterproposal and said the </p><p>GOG hopes to initial an agreement with us "very soon." </p><p>Gutierrez said that re-certifying Guatemala early (before the </p><p>normal September review) would reduce the impact of the </p><p>decision on the November presidential elections, and would be </p><p>healthy for all sides.  DAS McCarthy noted that the interests </p><p>of the different USG agencies that weigh-in on certification </p><p>decisions are very diverse, and urged the Guatemalans to </p><p>sustain counter-narcotics performance in all areas if they </p><p>want an early review of their certification status. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Ambassador said that we were pleased with the </p><p>Castillo extradition, but that other extradition requests are </p><p>pending that could be moved forward by the GOG.  He noted </p><p>that the Attorney General\'s office is cooperating with an </p><p>extensive request by DOJ for evidence in a recent money </p><p>laundering case in which cash was seized in Guatemala, and </p><p>that completing that request is very important to us.  He </p><p>added that we remain interested in seeing the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office assign greater personnel resources to their </p><p>money laundering unit, and said that cooperation between that </p><p>unit and bank supervisors is still inadequate.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted, however, that we have been pleased with the </p><p>passage of asset forfeiture legislation, the increase in </p><p>cocaine seizures, the burning of stored drugs used for </p><p>evidence in old cases and other progress in counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation.  President Portillo said "you will see new </p><p>progress in the next week!" </p><p> </p><p>New Steps on Labor Reform </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>10. (C) DOL Jorge Perez-Lopez told President Portillo that he </p><p>had met at length with Minister of Labor Victor Moreira on </p><p>May 13 and was pleased with the recent establishment of a </p><p>bilateral working group on labor rights, formed at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s suggestion in the context of a GSP labor rights </p><p>review.  He said the USG views this as an important mechanism </p><p>for continuing dialogue on this critical issue that has </p><p>implications for human rights and free trade.  President </p><p>Portillo recounted his government\'s actions in promoting </p><p>labor rights, and the opposition these had generated on the </p><p>part of the private sector.  He said that he intends to </p><p>promote further reforms in his remaining months in office, </p><p>including one aimed specifically at reducing the time labor </p><p>courts can consider a case from the current two years down to </p><p>six months. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>11. (C) President Portillo clearly appreciated the chance to </p><p>meet with visiting senior USG officials, and to articulate </p><p>his vision for progress on the bilateral agenda in the </p><p>remaining months of his presidency.  He has made conclusion </p><p>of a free trade agreement with us and regaining certification </p><p>as a cooperating partner in the war on drugs a high priority, </p><p>but provided little indication that peace accord </p><p>implementation would see much concrete progress in coming </p><p>months.  We will continue to press Portillo to not let the </p><p>election campaign distract him from the full range of issues </p><p>on our bilateral agenda. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The cable was not cleared by visiting USTR, USAID, </p><p>DOS and DOL officials prior to their departure from post. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
