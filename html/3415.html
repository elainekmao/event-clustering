(U) SUMMARY:  FOR ONE VIETNAMESE FARMER IN THE </p><p>MEKONG DELTA, PRODUCTION OF "TRA" AND "BASA" -- THE </p><p>FISH FORMERLY KNOWN AS "CATFISH" -- IS A STUNNING </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE </p><p>UNFETTERED APPLICATION OF FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES. </p><p>FIERCE COMPETITION AND SELF-TAUGHT MARKET SAVVY SEEM TO </p><p>BE CREATING A NEW BREED OF FARMER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NGUYEN VAN THO, "THE CATFISH KING" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON JULY 18, AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT AND AN </p><p>EMBASSY/CONSULATE GENERAL TEAM (DPO, ECONOFF, FSN </p><p>POL/ECON ASSISTANT, AND INTERPRETER) VISITED A </p><p>FINGERLING FARM AND FLOATING CAGE OWNED BY NGUYEN VAN </p><p>THO, KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE "KING OF CATFISH.",  HE IS </p><p>THE BIGGEST PRIVATE "TRA" AND "BASA" PRODUCER IN AN </p><p>GIANG PROVINCE.  TRAINED BY HIS FATHER AND A VIETNAMESE </p><p>PH.D. FISHERIES ADVISOR, THO WAS A POOR FARMER WITH NO </p><p>FORMAL EDUCATION WHO TOOK A CHANCE ON THE GROWING TRA </p><p>AND BASA MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THO LITERALLY BUILT HIS BUSINESS FROM THE GROUND </p><p>UP.  IN 1995, THO BEGAN BUYING LAND FROM NEIGHBORS, </p><p>PAYING APPROXIMATELY VND 200 MILLION (USD 1300) PER </p><p>HECTARE.  TO FINANCE THESE PURCHASES, THO OBTAINED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00785  01 OF 02  010759Z </p><p>LOANS FROM FRIENDS AND VIETNAMESE PRIVATE BANKS.  HE </p><p>SAID STATE-OWNED BANKS WERE RELUCTANT TO LEND MONEY TO </p><p>PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN, AND THE GOVERNMENT GAVE HIM NO </p><p>LOANS OR SUBSIDIES.  WHEN HE HAD ACQUIRED 14 HECTARES, </p><p>THO INVESTED VND 400 MILLION (USD 2670) TO DEVELOP 80 </p><p>PONDS ON THE LAND.  THO PLANS TO DEVELOP ANOTHER 20 </p><p>HECTARES IF AMERICAN CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO SNAP UP HIS </p><p>FISH.  IN ADDITION, THO ANCHORS 40 FLOATING CAGES IN </p><p>THE RIVER, EACH WEIGHING 25 TO 50 METRIC TONS. </p><p> </p><p>A FORTUNE IN FISH </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THO\'S HOMEGROWN FISH BUSINESS TURNS OVER </p><p>APPROXIMATELY VND 24 BILLION (USD 1,600,000), WITH A </p><p>NET PROFIT OF VND 4 BILLION (USD 267,000) ANNUALLY.  HE </p><p>OPERATES FAIRLY CLOSE TO HIS BOTTOM LINE, HOWEVER.  IF </p><p>THE PRICE REMAINS AT VND 12,000 (USD 0.80) PER </p><p>KILOGRAM, THO MAKES A PROFIT.  BUT HE LOSES MONEY IF </p><p>THE PRICE DECLINES BY AS LITTLE AS USD 0.05, TO VND </p><p>9,000 (USD 0.75) PER KILOGRAM.  THO SELLS HIS FISH TO </p><p>THE HIGHEST BIDDER, USUALLY FISH PROCESSING FACTORIES </p><p>LINING THE RIVER WHO RECEIVE THE LIVE FISH DIRECTLY </p><p>FROM A TRANSPORT SHIP.  AFTER THE FISH IS PROCESSED AND </p><p>FROZEN, IT IS EXPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES\' EAST </p><p>COAST, WHERE THO\'S TRA FILLET SELLS FOR USD 1.71- </p><p>1.75/POUND (USD 3.76-3.85/KILOGRAM).  BASA SELLS FOR </p><p>USD 2.00-2.03/POUND (USD 4.40-4.47/KILOGRAM). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) IN ADDITION TO HIS "WHOLE FISH" OPERATION </p><p>DESCRIBED ABOVE, THO PRODUCES 10 MILLION FISH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00785  01 OF 02  010759Z </p><p>"FINGERLINGS" ANNUALLY, WHICH HE SELLS TO OTHER MEKONG </p><p>DELTA FARMERS FOR VND 10 BILLION (USD 670,000), FOR A </p><p>NET PROFIT OF VND 2 BILLION (USD 133,000).  THE </p><p>FINGERLINGS SELL FROM VND 300-1200 (USD 0.02-0.08) EACH </p><p>AT 30-85 DAYS OLD.  THUS ALTOGETHER, THO\'S FISH </p><p>BUSINESS NETS A PROFIT OF USD 400,000 PER YEAR.  THO </p><p>HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT, IN ADDITION TO HIS </p><p>IMMEDIATE FAMILY, THE BUSINESS NOW SUPPORTS THE </p><p>FAMILIES OF 16 RELATIVES.  THO HIMSELF HAS BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>SEND ALL FOUR OF HIS CHILDREN TO STUDY ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>LOW TECH BUT HIGH PRODUCTION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THO AND HIS DAUGHTER, WHO STUDIED ENGLISH FOR </p><p>SIX MONTHS IN AUSTRALIA, ESCORTED THE AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>CONGEN TEAM THROUGH THE 14-HECTARE FINGERLING FARM, A </p><p>SERIES OF EARTHEN PONDS LINKED BY WOODEN GANGPLANKS, </p><p>WITH A LONG, OPEN SHED HOUSING THE RUDIMENTARY BREEDING </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  ALTHOUGH THE FACILITIES ARE BASIC, THE </p><p>PONDS ARE DRAINED AND CLEANED EVERY 15 DAYS AND PH </p><p>TESTS ARE USED TO ENSURE WATER QUALITY.  THO EITHER </p><p>SELLS THE FINGERLINGS OR TRANSFERS THEM TO HIS OWN </p><p>CAGES.

(SBU) FURTHER DOWN THE RIVER, THE AMBASSADOR BOARDED </p><p>THO\'S HOME, A HOUSEBOAT WITH A GIANT FISH CAGE </p><p>UNDERNEATH.  VARIOUS FLOATING FISH PENS WERE ATTACHED </p><p>TO THE SIDES, AND THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS TIED </p><p>TOGETHER BY ROPES AND ANCHORED TO THE RIVER BOTTOM. </p><p>FEEDING THE FISH WAS SIMPLE.  WORKERS OPENED A TRAP </p><p>DOOR IN THE CENTER OF THE HOUSE AND DUMPED A SACK OF </p><p>FISHFOOD INTO THE WATER BELOW.  THE SUBSEQUENT FEEDING </p><p>FRENZY SHOWED LARGE FISH ROILING IN THE MURKY WATER. </p><p>THO SAID HE ONCE USED AMERICAN CARGILL FISHFOOD FOR </p><p>FISH WEIGHING OVER 600 GRAMS, AS WELL AS PROCONCO AND </p><p>UNI-PRESIDENT FEED.  BUT HE HAD STOPPED BUYING FROM </p><p>CARGILL BECAUSE OF WHAT HE TERMED "QUALITY" CONCERNS </p><p>AND A LACK OF RESPONSIVENESS TO HIS SUGGESTIONS. </p><p>(NOTE:  POST WILL FOLLOW UP ON THIS WITH CARGILL, WHEN </p><p>THEIR LOCAL EXECUTIVES RETURN FROM VACATION.) </p><p> </p><p>ROARING CAPITALISM IN THE PLACID DELTA </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THO OWES HIS SUCCESS TO HIS INGENUITY, SMART </p><p>INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND SHEER CHUTZPAH.  HE ALSO </p><p>BENEFITS FROM VIETNAM\'S CHEAP LABOR, HUGE AMOUNTS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00785  02 OF 02  010759Z </p><p>FREE, RELATIVELY CLEAN WATER, AND CREATIVE CONCEPTS, </p><p>SUCH AS GIANT PORTABLE CAGES.  WHILE THE OTHER 5000 </p><p>FISH FARMERS IN AN GIANG PROVINCE ARE NOT AS SUCCESSFUL </p><p>AS THO, TOGETHER THEY PRODUCE HALF OF VIETNAM\'S ENTIRE </p><p>TRA AND BASA HARVEST, ESTIMATED AT 120,000 METRIC TONS. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FISH FARMS ARE </p><p>PRIVATELY-OWNED BUSINESSES WITH FAMILY SAVINGS (OR </p><p>DEBT) INVESTED.  ONLY ONE FULLY-OWNED STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISE (SOE) CONTINUES TO PRODUCE TRA AND BASA IN </p><p>AN GIANG (IT ONLY HAS 40 CAGES), ALTHOUGH THO SAID THE </p><p>STATE OWNS A SHARE OF ONE LARGE PRIVATIZED PRODUCER AND </p><p>THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY ITSELF IS A MIX OF SOES AND </p><p>PRIVATE BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) COMMENT: NGUYEN VAN THO CREATED A MILLION- </p><p>DOLLAR BUSINESS, USING ONLY PRIVATE FUNDS AND ELBOW </p><p>GREASE.  HIS FUTURE SUCCESS AND THAT OF OTHER PRIVATE </p><p>ENTREPRENEURS WILL DEPEND ON THE GVN\'S WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>LET THEM OUTPERFORM THE SOES AND BECOME MAJOR MARKET </p><p>FORCES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  THESE NEW ENTREPRENEURS </p><p>WILL BE THE ONES WHO DEAL WITH THE FIERCE COMPETITION </p><p>IN WORLD MARKETS.  ALTHOUGH THE ANTI-DUMPING CASE WAS </p><p>ONLY DISCUSSED BRIEFLY, THO (AND OTHER SCRAPPY </p><p>ENTREPRENEURS) MAY LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT BEING TOO </p><p>SUCCESSFUL CAN TRIGGER UNEXPECTED REACTIONS -- AND </p><p>LEAVE HIM WONDERING HOW HIS COMPETITIVE EDGE WORKED </p><p>AGAINST HIM. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
