<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL ARMENIA PROCLAMATION: GOT SENSITIVITIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: MFA DG Tezcan expressed the GOT\'s opposition </p><p>to use of the term "genocide" in referring to the events of </p><p>1915 and asked the U.S. to refrain from using that term in </p><p>connection with the April commemoration events.  DCM </p><p>encouraged the GOT to renew efforts to reconcile views of </p><p>history and to seek ways to improve relations with Armenia. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On March 28, at the MFA\'s request, DCM met with Ecvet </p><p>Tezcan, DG for Intelligence and Research.  Tezcan, who was </p><p>accompanied by DDG for the Americas Suna Ilicak, wanted to </p><p>highlight Turkey\'s concern regarding the content of President </p><p>Bush\'s upcoming April 24 Armenia proclamation.  The GOT had </p><p>learned that 104 Congressmen had jointly sent a letter to the </p><p>President asking that this year he use the word "genocide" in </p><p>describing the events of 1915. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tezcan underlined Turkish sensitivities about the use </p><p>of genocide, reminding DCM that characterization of the 1915 </p><p>events as genocide would affect bilateral relations, as it </p><p>had with France.  He described U.S.-Turkey relations as </p><p>fundamentally close and durable, but he urged that we not add </p><p>a further "test" by making an issue of what, from the Turkish </p><p>perspective, ought to be a matter for historians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Harkening back to the year 2000 debate regarding the </p><p>commemoration, Tezcan called the annual commemoration a </p><p>"sword of Damocles" for our bilateral relationship.  He </p><p>expressed displeasure with the use in last year\'s </p><p>proclamation of the word "massacre," but he did not push the </p><p>point.  He thought that certain groups might view the current </p><p>U.S.-Turkish "problems" over northern Iraq as an opportunity </p><p>to profit at Turkey\'s expense, but he asked that the USG </p><p>recognize the dangers of stirring centuries\' old hatreds in </p><p>the region at this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The DCM replied that the USG recognizes Turkey\'s </p><p>sensitivity on this topic.  He added that we had always found </p><p>ways to address the issue, but we encourage Turkey to </p><p>reinvigorate the attempts to reconcile differing views of </p><p>history.  We also encourage Turkey to facilitate steps to put </p><p>Armenian-Turkish bilateral relations on a "better footing," </p><p>such as opening the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
