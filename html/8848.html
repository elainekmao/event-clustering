<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-19-13 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 93  (06-19-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Joseph L. Novak, Charge d\'Affaires, </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  BAIL REFUSED FOR FORMER DEP. DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>-          NO JAZZ IN JAFFNA </p><p>-          PM SPEECH </p><p>-          VISA REQUEST FOR PROPOSED SRI LANKAN EMBOFF </p><p> </p><p>BAIL REFUSED FOR FORMER DEP. DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) FYI:  Former Dep. defense minister (and close </p><p>relative of President Kumaratunga) Anuruddha Ratwatte was </p><p>again refused bail by a Sri Lankan lower court on June </p><p>18.  As previously reported, Ratwatte and 14 others </p><p>(including two of his sons) are incarcerated due to their </p><p>alleged involvement in the murder of 10 Muslims that took </p><p>place on election day in December 2001.  The generally </p><p>pro-Kumaratunga Supreme Court had earlier directed the </p><p>lower court to consider the bail applications.  It is not </p><p>clear whether the Supreme Court will intervene to </p><p>overrule the lower court.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>NO JAZZ IN JAFFNA </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2.  (C) FYI.  In preparation for a Mission-planned </p><p>cultural event in Jaffna, our PAO went north on June 18 </p><p>to meet with the Additional Government Agent (AGA) and </p><p>tour possible concert venues.  The PAO received a cool </p><p>reception from the AGA, who suggested that the event be </p><p>postponed until September or October from the planned </p><p>July 23 date.  This response was in sharp contrast to a </p><p>June 16 meeting between the AGA and Pol FSN, when the </p><p>idea of the cultural event -- a jazz trio -- was warmly </p><p>received.  The change in attitude from June 16 to June 18 </p><p>is most likely due to the Tigers being briefed -- and </p><p>deciding that they did not like the jazz idea.  (Note: </p><p>We don\'t think the Tigers have anything against Chet </p><p>Baker, per se.  The group, however, has been assiduously </p><p>blocking other efforts to return life in Jaffna to </p><p>normal.  The group, for example, scrubbed the re-opening </p><p>of the Jaffna library earlier this year.)  In any case, </p><p>Public Affairs is relocating the venue to Kandy, which is </p><p>unfortunate because there has not been a USG-sponsored </p><p>cultural event in Jaffna for many a year.  (POL/PAO) </p><p> </p><p>PM SPEECH </p><p>--------- </p><p>3.  (SBU) PM Wickremesinghe is slated to give a (pre- </p><p>recorded) national address re the peace process tonight </p><p>(June 19) on national TV.  (Note:  Per yesterday\'s o/i </p><p>note on this, we had originally been told that the speech </p><p>would consist of old video of the PM\'s remarks made at </p><p>Tokyo, but it now seems the PM is giving a brand new </p><p>speech.)  We will be in touch with you if he makes any </p><p>dramatic announcements.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>VISA REQUEST FOR PROPOSED SRI LANKAN EMBOFF </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU) Per our o/i note from June 18 and previous e- </p><p>mail traffic:  In regards to the diplomatic visa for </p><p>Ilankoon Adikari, who the MFA has proposed for a public </p><p>relations slot at the SL Consulate General in Los </p><p>Angeles, we request that this appointment be turned off </p><p>by the SL MFA without our having to reject the </p><p>application.  As was previously mentioned in the June 18 </p><p>Desk(Waller) - Post(MWilliams) email, Ambassador </p><p>Subasinghe had offered to "kill" the case.  The </p><p>Department, however, did not think this was necessary at </p><p>the time and had said Colombo could deny the visa if it </p><p>was not justifiable. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In Mission\'s view, it would be far more </p><p>favorable if the GSL took action on this issue without a </p><p>formal denial from the Consular Section in Colombo. </p><p>Therefore, Mission would request that Ambassador </p><p>Subasinghe be taken up on his offer to "kill" the case. </p><p>This would result in the same outcome, but would be far </p><p>less contentious and not cause unnecessary difficulties </p><p>(which might include the MFA trying to take reciprocal </p><p>measures against us).  (CONS) </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
