<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/S-O, EAP, EAP/BCLTV, DRL, INR </p><p>STATE PASS USTR DAMOND </p><p>NSC FOR EAST ASIAN DIRECTORATE </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EAP STERN </p><p>USDOC FOR 4431/MAC/AP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00919  01 OF 03  181124Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: LEANER POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO BE UNVEILED AT WEEKEND COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HANOI 905   B) HANOI 638 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: FOUR NEW POLITBURO MEMBERS -- REPORTEDLY </p><p>INCLUDING MASS MOBILIZATION HEAD DUOC AND FORMER LABOR </p><p>MINISTER HOAN -- ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN A SLIMMED-DOWN, 15- </p><p>MEMBER LEADERSHIP TO BE UNVEILED AT THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, WHICH OPENS APRIL 19.  ON BALANCE, THE NEW </p><p>POLITBURO, EXPECTED TO BE HEADED BY ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH, </p><p>SHOULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC REFORM.  SEVEN MOSTLY </p><p>OLDER MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETIRE, INCLUDING GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU, FATHERLAND FRONT LEADER DUYET, AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ARMY POLITICAL COMMISSAR NGAN.  IN A SURPRISE, </p><p>SEVERAL SOURCES SAY DEFENSE MINISTER TRA, RECENTLY </p><p>DISCIPLINED BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WILL RETAIN HIS SEAT </p><p>AS THE LONE MILITARY MAN IN THE BODY.  THE LATEST REPORTS </p><p>WE HEAR ARE THAT PM KHAI WILL REMAIN IN PLACE, PERHAPS FOR </p><p>ANOTHER YEAR.  HCMC PARTY CHIEF TRIET, POPULAR AMONG HIS </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE PEERS, IS SAID BY SEVERAL SOURCES TO BE </p><p>HIS HEIR APPARENT.  OTHERS SAY FIRST DEPUTY PM DUNG WILL </p><p>RETAIN HIS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SLOT FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p>WE EXPECT THE LEANER, 150-MEMBER CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO TO </p><p>BE MARGINALLY MORE ASSERTIVE WITH THE POLITBURO AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00919  01 OF 03  181124Z </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC REFORM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS TO APPROVE NEW POLITBURO </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE 1,168 VOTING DELEGATES TO THE NINTH COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS (TWO OTHERS ARE ILL) WILL FORMALLY MEET </p><p>APRIL 19-22 IN BA DINH HALL TO APPROVE THE FOUR SEMINAL </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DOCUMENTS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>(CPV) AND TO APPROVE THE NEW LEADERSHIP LINEUP.  AS CITED </p><p>REF A, GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU APPEARS HIGHLY LIKELY </p><p>TO BE REPLACED BY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF SOURCES.  SEVERAL SOURCES REPORT </p><p>MANH, INITIALLY RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE SUPREME POST, AGREED </p><p>TO DO SO AFTER REQUESTS FROM CPV ELDERS AND WINNING A </p><p>STRONG VOTE OF SUPPORT FROM THE DELEGATES.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, OTHER REPORTS CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE THAT CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL AFFAIRS CHIEF NGUYEN VAN AN WAS CONSIDERED </p><p>ON THE LAST DAY OF THE PRE-CONGRESS FOR THE TOP SLOT.  IN </p><p>ANY EVENT, THE PROGRAM FOR THE CONGRESS NOTABLY OMITS THE </p><p>NAME OF THE GENERAL SECRETARY AT THE END OF THE CONGRESS, </p><p>WHILE LISTING PHIEU AT THE BEGINNING. (COMMENT: WE EXPECT </p><p>MANH TO BE UNVEILED THE AFTERNOON OF APRIL 22 WHEN THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE APRIL 21 CONGRESS ELECTIONS ARE FORMALLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED, BUT THIS OPAQUE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE HAS </p><p>SURPRISED US BEFORE, SO WE\'LL WAIT FOR THE SOLOIST IN THIS </p><p>CPV OPERA TO FINISH HER LAST ARIA BEFORE PRONOUNCING WITH </p><p>CERTAINTY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AMONG CPV-CONNECTED SOURCES </p><p>IS THAT FOUR NEW MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN A SLIMMED- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00919  01 OF 03  181124Z </p><p>DOWN, 15-MEMBER POLITBURO.  WE HEAR DIFFERENT NAMES FROM </p><p>DIFFERENT SOURCES.  HEAD OF THE CPV\'S MASS MOBILIZATION </p><p>ORGANIZATION, TRUONG QUANG DUOC, AND FORMER LABOR MINISTER </p><p>NGUYEN DINH HOAN ARE COMMON TO MOST LISTS.  BOTH SEEM </p><p>PLAUSIBLE CHOICES.  THE HEAD OF MASS MOBILIZATION </p><p>TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN A POLITBURO MEMBER, AND THIS IS THE </p><p>POST PHAM THE DUYET PREVIOUSLY HELD.  GIVEN UNREST IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND THE NEED TO RALLY POPULAR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>CPV POSITIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, THIS MAKES SENSE. </p><p>LIKEWISE, WE HAVE HEARD FROM A CLOSE WORKING CONTACT </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) AT THE LABOR MINISTRY, WHO CONSIDERS </p><p>HOAN HIS MENTOR, THAT HE BELIEVES HE MAY BE MOVING ON TO </p><p>WORK WITH HOAN WHEN HE MOVES UP TO THE POLITBURO. </p><p>(COMMENT: WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT DUOC BUT HIS CURRENT </p><p>PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY FOCUSED ON IDEOLOGICAL AND CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS.  HOAN IS AN ADVOCATE OF MORE RAPID </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORM, AND IS SEEN BY A FORMER DEPUTY </p><p>AS A PROGRESSIVE.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE OTHER TWO POLITBURO SLOTS ARE MORE MUDDLED.  ONE </p><p>CPV SOURCE SAYS CULTURE AND INFORMATION MINISTER NGUYEN </p><p>KHOA DIEM AND THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE CPV CONTROL </p><p>COMMISSION, LE HONG ANH, ARE THE OTHER TWO TAPPED FOR THE </p><p>ELITE BODY.  HOWEVER, EARLIER IN THE WEEK WE HEARD THAT </p><p>TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN AND DEPUTY PM KHIEM WERE SLATED FOR </p><p>THIS PROMOTION.  (COMMENT: RUMORS CIRCULATE THAT VU KHOAN </p><p>IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO TAKE THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DUTIES </p><p>OF RETIRING NGUYEN MANH CAM, WHO IS ALSO A POLITBURO </p><p>MEMBER.  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER KHOAN WILL TAKE OVER </p><p>EITHER THE POLITBURO SEAT AND POSSIBLY THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>POST.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SEVEN MOSTLY OLDER POLITBURO MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>STEP DOWN.  WE BELIEVE THEY WILL BE CPV GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>PHIEU, FATHERLAND FRONT HEAD DUYET, PEOPLE\'S ARMY POLITICAL </p><p>COMMISSAR GEN. PHAM THANH NGAN (WHO REPORTEDLY WILL FALL </p><p>WITH HIS MENTOR PHIEU), DEPUTY PM CAM, HO CHI MINH </p><p>POLITICAL ACADEMY DIRECTOR NGUYEN DUC BINH, CPV IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>AFFAIRS DIRECTOR LE XUAN TUNG, AND CPV CONTROL COMMISSION </p><p>CHAIRWOMAN NGUYEN THI XUAN MY.  WE HAVE LONG BELIEVED CAM, </p><p>BINH, AND TUNG WERE RIPE TO STEP DOWN.  PHIEU\'S AND DUYET\'S </p><p>BATTLES TO RETAIN THEIR POSTS OVER THE PAST MONTHS HAVE </p><p>BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED.  LIKEWISE, MY WAS STRONGLY CRITICIZED </p><p>FOR HER POOR MANAGEMENT OF THE CRITICISM/SELF-CRITICISM </p><p>CAMPAIGN, BUT THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK </p><p>WAS THE CPV WOULD NOT WANT TO REMOVE THE ONLY WOMAN EVER </p><p>APPOINTED TO THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00919  02 OF 03  181124Z </p><p>7. (C) THE MOST INTERESTING NAME ON THIS LIST, NGAN, IS </p><p>CLOSELY TIED TO THE MOST INTERESTING OMISSION, TRA.  GEN. </p><p>NGAN HAS LONG BEEN SEEN AS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL "COMERS" </p><p>AMONG THE POLITBURO, BUT IT HAS BEEN CLEAR HIS RAPID RECENT </p><p>RISE WAS CLOSELY TIED TO PHIEU\'S.  HE FOLLOWED PHIEU AS </p><p>POLITICAL COMMISSAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND OVER THE PAST </p><p>YEAR SEVERAL MILITARY SOURCES SUGGESTED HE WAS DESTINED FOR </p><p>HIGHER THINGS.  CONVERSELY, THE AGING DEFENSE MINISTER TRA </p><p>WAS SHARPLY RAPPED ON THE KNUCKLES BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>ONLY WEEKS AGO, IN PART FOR THE VIOLATIONS OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>AIRSPACE BY VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN SELF-DESCRIBED "FREEDOM </p><p>FIGHTER" LY TONG.  THAT REPRIMAND SEEMED TO FORESHADOW HIS </p><p>LIKELY RETIREMENT FROM HIS GOVERNMENT AND POLITBURO POSTS. </p><p>WE SUSPECT TRA MAY HAVE BEEN RETAINED EITHER AS A SOP TO </p><p>PHIEU LOYALISTS, OR AS PART OF OTHER BARGAINING WITH </p><p>MILITARY SUPPORTERS.  STRIKINGLY, IF THE CURRENT FORECASTED </p><p>LINE-UP HOLDS, TRA WOULD BE THE ONLY MILITARY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>KHAI REPORTED TO STAY ON AS PRIME MINISTER </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) CONTRARY TO REPORTS IN REF A, THE LATEST REPORTS WE </p><p>HEAR ARE THAT PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI WILL REMAIN IN </p><p>PLACE FOR THE TIME BEING, PERHAPS FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  HCMC </p><p>PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET, WHO POLLED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>SUPPORT AMONG HIS CENTRAL COMMITTEE PEERS IN SEVERAL </p><p>BALLOTS OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS, APPARENTLY IS SEEN BY MANY </p><p>AS HEIR APPARENT.  HOWEVER, FOR THE TIME BEING, IT APPEARS </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY PM NGUYEN TAN DUNG WILL RETAIN HIS SLOT AND </p><p>THUS A PLAUSIBLE CLAIM AS PM-IN-WAITING.  (COMMENT: TRIET, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00919  02 OF 03  181124Z </p><p>DUNG AND TRUONG TAN SANG HAVE LONG BEEN SEEN AS THE </p><p>YOUNGER, MORE DYNAMIC SOUTHERN REFORMERS MOST LIKELY TO </p><p>TAKE OVER FROM KHAI.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) SOURCES SUGGEST THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE WILL </p><p>HAVE 150 MEMBERS (VERSUS 170 FOR THAT ELECTED IN 1996). </p><p>CPV BRIEFERS SAID APRIL 18 THE CPV WOULD EMPHASIZE "QUALITY </p><p>OVER QUANTITY" AS PART OF ITS STREAMLINING.  CPV OFFICIALS </p><p>TOLD THE PRESS THE CPV WOULD BRING BACK A SECRETARIAT STAFF </p><p>THAT WOULD RUN THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) IF THE FORECASTED LINE-UPS ARE CONFIRMED APRIL 22, </p><p>THE NEW LEANER LEADERSHIP BODIES OF THE CPV LOOK TO BE </p><p>MODESTLY MORE SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING THE PACE OF ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM.  NOTABLE IS THAT MOST OF THE IDEOLOGICAL DEADWOOD </p><p>OF THE SEPTUAGENARIANS IN THE POLITBURO WILL BE RETIRED. </p><p>SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS LIKELY WILL PROVIDE MORE VIGOR </p><p>IN PRESSING THE REFORM PROGRAM.  THAT SAID, THIS IS A </p><p>COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP, AND THE SCREEDS AGAINST THE U.S. IN </p><p>THE PRESS AND THE REFLEXIVE HARPING ON THE DANGERS OF </p><p>"PEACEFUL EVOLUTION" INDICATE REFORM CHANGES WILL BE </p><p>GRADUAL AND MEASURED.  MANH IS A COALITION BUILDER, AND </p><p>THOUGH PERHAPS LESS WELL-REPRESENTED IN THE TOP RANK, THE </p><p>MILITARY, PUBLIC SECURITY AND CPV IDEOLOGUES STILL COMMAND </p><p>IMPORTANT SEATS AT THE TABLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
