PASS S/E WOLPE </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MBEKI "SEIZES THE MOMENT" IN STATE VISIT </p><p>TO WASHINGTON; WANTS AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY ON </p><p>HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: PRETORIA 3414 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DELANO LEWIS.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. IN A MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR LEWIS, PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI DESCRIBED HIS UPCOMING STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. AS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO "SEIZE THE MOMENT" TO TACKLE PROBLEMS OF </p><p>POVERTY AND LACK OF DEVELOPMENT THAT PLAGUE SOUTH AFRICA.  HE </p><p>SEEKS INVESTMENT FOR SOUTH AFRICA AS A MEANS TO POVERTY </p><p>ALLEVIATION IN A COUNTRY THAT CANNOT COMPETE FAVORABLY FOR </p><p>INVESTORS WITH AN INDIA, CHINA, OR BRAZIL.  MBEKI WANTS TO </p><p>EXPLORE WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON WAYS TO TACKLE THE NEGATIVE </p><p>IMAGE, FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SOUTH AFRICA PRESENTS TO THE </p><p>WORLD AS A COUNTRY RIDDLED WITH CRIME. MBEKI CONTRADICTS THE </p><p>VIEW THAT CRIME IN SOUTH AFRICA IS WORSE THAN ANY PLACE ELSE. </p><p>HE UNDERSTANDS THE NEGATIVE FALLOUT, IN PUBLIC RELATIONS </p><p>TERMS, PRODUCED BY HIS CONTROVERSIAL POSITION ON HIV/AIDS HAS </p><p>PRODUCED AND HAS DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH HIS STAFF. </p><p>AMBASSADOR LEWIS WILL MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL TO EXPLORE A COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY ON THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S HIV/AIDS POSITION THAT HIGHLIGHTS HIS POSITIVE </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMBATTING THE HIV/AIDS SCOURGE.  MBEKI </p><p>CONTINUES TO HOLD THE VIEW THAT VARYING OPINIONS MUST BE </p><p>HEARD.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT HIS DESIRE </p><p>TO SEE MBEKI HAVE A SUCCESSFUL U.S. TRIP AND HAS OFFERED ALL </p><p>HIS HELP AND CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE TO ENABLE THE PRESIDENT TO </p><p>ACHIEVE GOALS BOTH THE U.S. AND MBEKI SHARE FOR SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR LEWIS, ACCOMPANIED BY POLCOUNSELOR, MET </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT MBEKI MAY 3 AT THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE IN </p><p>PRETORIA.  PRESIDENT MBEKI WAS JOINED BY THE REV. FRANK </p><p>CHIKANE, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY, </p><p>AND BY ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER AZIZ PAHAD.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REQUESTED THE MEETING TO DISCUSS GOALS FOR THE MBEKI STATE </p><p>VISIT TO THE U.S. MAY 22-23, THE OPTICS OF MBEKI\'S </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL POSITION ON HIV/AIDS, AND THE SITUATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  REFTEL ADDRESSED ZIMBABWE.  THIS CABLE REVIEWS THE </p><p>DISCUSSION ON MBEKI\'S U.S. STATE VISIT AND HIS HIV/AIDS </p><p>POSTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>SEIZING THE MOMENT WITH A STATE VISIT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN RESPONSE TO AN INQUIRY FROM AMBASSADOR LEWIS, </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI GROUNDED HIS OBJECTIVES FOR HIS UPCOMING </p><p>STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. IN REMARKS MADE BY PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>IN THREE SPEECHES -- BEFORE THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW </p><p>YORK LAST SEPTEMBER, AT DAVOS, AND AT THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN </p><p>RELATIONS IN NEW YORK IN 1998.  MBEKI REMARKED THAT IN THOSE </p><p>SPEECHES, CLINTON HIGHLIGHTED THE ASTOUNDING HIGH NUMBERS OF </p><p>POOR PEOPLE WORLDWIDE; THE TENDENCY OF PHARMACEUTICALS TO </p><p>RESEARCH AND DEVELOP DRUGS THAT DON\'T HELP CURE DISEASES OF </p><p>THE POOR BECAUSE THE POOR COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THOSE </p><p>DRUGS; AND THE ROLE THE INDONESIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS HAD HAD </p><p>IN THRUSTING ENTIRE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES INTO POVERTY. </p><p>SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE.  CLINTON IS RIGHT TO RAISE THESE </p><p>ISSUES, MBEKI SAID, AND THERE IS A "PARTICULAR MOMENT" IN </p><p>HISTORY NOW THAT HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO DEAL WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)   MBEKI CONTINUED THAT HE DID NOT THINK MANY PEOPLE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THIS ASPECT OF WHAT CLINTON WAS SAYING.  AT THE </p><p>COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, CLINTON EXPRESSED A NEED TO </p><p>LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE, TO SEEK </p><p>STABLE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS, AND TO ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>SHORT-TERM  CAPITAL FLOWS AND STRENGTHENING THE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM.  YET IN THE END, CLINTON IS SAYING THAT ONE IS STILL </p><p>LEFT WITH BILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE.  EVEN RECENTLY, MBEKI </p><p>ADDED, THE CEO OF CITICORP REMARKED THAT THOSE AT THE TOP END </p><p>OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM SHOULD NOT PRESUME THAT THEIR ISSUES </p><p>ARE THE KINDS OF ISSUES THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE WANT </p><p>ADDRESSED.   THIS STATEMENT, MBEKI SAID, INDICATES "FURTHER </p><p>CHANGE IN THE AIR." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>IN SEARCH OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)   THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED TO MBEKI THAT HE APPEARED </p><p>TO BE SAYING THAT HIS U.S. VISIT WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A </p><p>PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND THAT PRIVATE INVESTMENT COULD VERY WELL FORM </p><p>A PART OF THAT MOMENT.  MBEKI AGREED.  HE SAID ALL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT HAS FOCUSED ON CAPITAL AND THE NEED TO INVEST </p><p>CAPITAL.  AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON WAS SAYING THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO GET DIRECT </p><p>INVESTMENT INTO COUNTRIES, BUT WHAT MUST ONE DO?   IF ONE IS </p><p>A CHINA, MBEKI SAID, IT IS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE MARKET </p><p>IS HUGE AND NO ONE CAN STAY AWAY FROM THAT MARKET. BUT WHAT </p><p>OF SOUTH AFRICA WITH ONLY 40 MILLION PEOPLE?  SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>CANNOT ATTRACT THE INVESTMENT OF AN INIDIA, CHINA, OR BRAZIL. </p><p>IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE SOUTH AFRICA ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTMENT? </p><p>HE SPOKE OF POSSIBILITIES USING INTERNAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH </p><p>AS THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PENSION FUND.  "IF YOU </p><p>POLITICALLY INTERVENE," MBEKI CONTINUED, "YOU MAY BE ABLE TO </p><p>MAKE A DIFFERENCE."  MBEKI SAID CLINTON UNDERSTOOD THIS NEED </p><p>TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN HE SAID THAT POVERTY IS </p><p>INTOLERABLE.  "BUT HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE DEVELOPMENT?," MBEKI </p><p>ASKED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE DESIRE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR COMMENTED ON HIS PERSONAL BACKGROUND WHICH </p><p>BRINGS 20 PLUS YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO THE "TIME AND </p><p>MOMENT" OF HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH AFRICA.  HE </p><p>TOLD MBEKI HE WAS RIGHT THAT SOME PEOPLE DO NOT SEE THE TIME </p><p>AND MOMENT.  HE INDICATED TO MBEKI HIS DESIRE AND THAT OF HIS </p><p>MISSION TO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIM TO SEE IF TOGETHER THEY </p><p>MIGHT SEEK WAYS TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL </p><p>INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED HIS </p><p>POSITIVE MEETING EARLIER IN THE DAY WITH MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WHO WERE EXCITED ABOUT BEING IN </p><p>THE SOUTHERN AFRICA REGION AND EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS </p><p>FOR INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. HE ALSO TOLD MBEKI THAT AT </p><p>THE STATE DINNER PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS PLANNING FOR HIM IN </p><p>WASHINGTON, THERE WOULD BE MANY BUSINESS LEADERS AND CHIEF </p><p>EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PRESENT.  SOUTH AFRICA MUST CREATE A </p><p>CLIMATE TO ATTRACT THEIR INVESTMENT HERE BY TACKLING ISSUES </p><p>SUCH AS CRIME. IF THERE IS A PERCEIVED LACK OF STABILITY, </p><p>ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS WOULD PROVE MORE DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>THE NEED TO TACKLE SOUTH AFRICA\'S CRIME-RIDDEN IMAGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FOLLOWING ON AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS, MBEKI MADE THE </p><p>POINT THAT SOMETHING WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA SEEMS TO CONVEY A </p><p>MESSAGE THAT CRIME IS AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM IN SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NO WORSE THAN THAT OF A COUNTRY SUCH AS </p><p>BRAZIL.   IT IS INCORRECT, IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT, MBEKI </p><p>OPINED, TO ATTRIBUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF CRIME TO SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>MBEKI EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT SUCH TALK IS DRIVEN BY SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS WHO HAVE PLACED INTO THEIR OWN HEADS AND INTO THE </p><p>HEADS OF OTHERS THE NOTION THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS NOT SAFE. </p><p>WE IN SOUTH AFRICA, HE SAID, "BEAT THE DRUMS WHEN ONE BANK </p><p>ROBBERY OCCURS", WHILE IN FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 80 BANK </p><p>ROBBERIES OCCUR PER MONTH, BUT THEY ARE NOT REPORTED IN THE </p><p>PRESS.  THIS IS DONE BECAUSE FRANCE FEARS SUCH STATISTICS </p><p>WOULD GIVE FRANCE A BAD NAME. "I  DON\'T KNOW HOW," HE SAID, </p><p>\'WE TURN THIS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AROUND."   MBEKI SAID HE </p><p>WOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH PRESIDENT CINTON DURING THE STATE </p><p>VISIT.  HE ADDED THAT THE MESSAGE ON CRIME MUST ALSO BE </p><p>CONVEYED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p>DEALING WITH THE OPTICS OF A CONTROVERSIAL HIV / AIDS POSITION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD MBEKI THAT HE WANTED TO RAISE </p><p>WITH HIM THE SCENARIO HE IS LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER UPON HIS </p><p>ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON FOR HIS STATE VISIT, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>LIGHT OF THE POSITION HE HAS TAKEN ON HIV/AIDS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT WANT THAT POSITION, AND </p><p>OTHERS\' REACTION TO IT, TO OVERSHADOW THE VISIT AND THE VERY </p><p>POSITIVE THINGS MBEKI IS DOING IN SOUTH AFRICA TO COMBAT </p><p>AIDS.  HE NOTED THAT THE ISSUE HAD DOGGED VICE PRESIDENT GORE </p><p>ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND MANY ACTIVISTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S VIEWS.  WE STAND READY, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>CONTINUED, TO HELP YOU THINK THROUGH A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY </p><p>TO CONFRONT THIS SCENARIO. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS HAD NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>HELPFUL NOW TO STRESS THE POSITIVE THINGS BEING DONE IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT </p><p>THIS COULD COMPLEMENT THE VERY POSITIVE STATEMENTS BOTH </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY SUSAN RICE AND PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE </p><p>ABOUT HIS LETTER ON HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT ACTIVISTS MIGHT ATTEMPT TO BOYCOTT THE DURBAN </p><p>CONFERENCE ON AIDS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  MBEKI NODDED IN AGREEMENT, SAYING HE AND HIS STAFF </p><p>HAD DISCUSSED APPROACHES TO THE SCENARIO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DESCRIBED.  YET HE DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BOYCOTT THE </p><p>DURBAN CONFERENCE.  HE LAMENTED THAT THE ORGANIZERS OF THE </p><p>DURBAN CONFERENCE APPEARED TO WANT TO BAR EXHIBITS THAT DID </p><p>NOT DOVETAIL WITH THEIR VIEWS.  AS SUCH, THEY HAD WITHDRAWN </p><p>PERMISSION FOR AN ACT-UP SAN FRANCISCO EXHIBITION, SAYING </p><p>"OTHER NGOS" HAD BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THEIR POINT OF VIEW. </p><p>THIS GROUP SUPPORTED DISSENTING VIEWS.  THE PRESIDENT\'S LEGAL </p><p>ADVOCATE MOJANKU GUMBI HAD DETERMINED THAT THE ACTION OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZERS WAS ILLEGAL.  IN THE END, ACT-UP SAN FRANCISCO WAS </p><p>GRANTED PERMISSION TO PUT UP ITS EXHIBIT, BUT THE PASSING OF </p><p>TIME HAD MEANT THERE WERE NO LONGER SPACES IN THE MAIN </p><p>EXHIBIT HALL.  WHAT IS TROUBLING, MBEKI SAID, IS THAT PEOPLE </p><p>ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY DIFFER WITH YOUR VIEWS, </p><p>DISCUSSION OF YOUR VIEWS IS NOT PERMITTED.  MBEKI SAID </p><p>DESPITE ACT-UP\'S DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE LOCATION ASSIGNED TO </p><p>THEIR EXHIBIT, HE HAD INSTRUCTED HIS MINISTER OF HEALTH TO </p><p>PUT THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN WRITING TO THE ORGANIZERS, BUT </p><p>THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISRUPTION OF CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, REV. </p><p>CHIKANE ASKED IF THE AMBASSADOR MIGHT MEET WITH HIM TO </p><p>DISCUSS FURTHER POSSIBLE COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES THE </p><p>PRESIDENT MIGHT USE IN WASHINGTON TO TACKLE THE NEGATIVE </p><p>PUBLICITY OF MBEKI\'S STANCE ON HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>AGREED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) PRESIDENT MBEKI WAS VERY UPBEAT ABOUT HIS VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON AND HIS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON, AS A "FRIEND OF AFRICA", PERMEATED HIS REMARKS. WHAT </p><p>MBEKI WANTS MOST TO ACHIEVE IS INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT FOR </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA. THAT REMAINS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF HIS VISIT </p><p>AGENDA. ON HIS CONTROVERSIAL HIV/AIDS POSITION, WE DO NOT </p><p>EXPECT TO SEE CHANGE.  WE DO EXPECT, HOWEVER, THAT MBEKI WILL </p><p>MOVE EARLY ON IN HIS VISIT TO POINT OUT THE POSITIVE ASPECTS </p><p>OF HIS HIV/AIDS PROGRAM.  THE AMBASSADOR WILL FOLLOW THROUGH </p><p>ON A MEETING WITH CHIKANE TO EXPLORE VIABLE OPTIONS FOR MBEKI </p><p>IN THIS AREA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEWIS </p><p></p></div>
