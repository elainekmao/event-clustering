<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OREP, EPET, SENV, ECON, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: U.S. OIL EXECUTIVES TELL SENATOR BINGAMAN </p><p>FLARING REDUCTION DEPENDS ON GON FUNDING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 3201 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: On August 31, Senator Bingaman (D-New </p><p>Mexico) met representatives of the three largest </p><p>Nigerian-based U.S. oil companies (ChevronTexaco, Conoco, and </p><p>ExxonMobile) to discuss natural gas flaring in Nigeria.  The </p><p>oil executives stated that efforts to halt gas flaring have </p><p>been hamstrung by the GON\'s lack of funding to the Nigerian </p><p>National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  ExxonMobil, second </p><p>largest producer in Nigeria after Shell, with 520,000 barrels </p><p>per day (bpd), plans to end flaring by 2005; Chevron-Texaco, </p><p>with production around 450,000 bpd, hopes to stop gas flaring </p><p>by 2007, a year before the GON-mandated 2008 deadline. </p><p>Conoco, a relatively small producer at 15,500 bpd, will </p><p>deplete its current production field in 2004.  The deep-water </p><p>blocks the companies are now developing will not flare gas. </p><p>The executives added that development of the natural gas </p><p>industry and of an internal market for natural gas has been </p><p>stifled by the GON\'s inability to formulate natural gas </p><p>policies that encourage private sector investment.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The U.S. oil executives who met with Senator Bingaman </p><p>were Steven L. Howard, ChevronTexaco Nigeria Limited General </p><p>Manager Finances and IT Department; Larry Salz, ExxonMobil </p><p>Producing Nigeria Unit Limited, Executive Director, </p><p>Production; John T. Capps, Conoco Energy Nigeria Limited </p><p>President and Managing Director. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Senator Concerned by Gas Flaring </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Senator Bingaman told the oil executives that his </p><p>interest in gas flaring had been piqued after meeting with </p><p>World Bank (WB) officials in Washington in early August. </p><p>Briefing the Senator on a proposed $3 to $4 million dollar </p><p>program to curtail gas flaring and venting, the WB officials </p><p>identified Russia and Nigeria as the two most prolific gas </p><p>flarers, with as much as 75 per cent of Nigeria\'s natural gas </p><p>being wasted. Pointing to the economic and environmental </p><p>losses caused by gas flaring, the Senator asked the oil </p><p>executives what steps they were taking to rectify this loss. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Slow Progress on Gas Flaring </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Salz said ExxonMobil, which mostly re-injects natural </p><p>gas into the wells in order to lift more crude, flares 25% to </p><p>30%, "probably the lowest in Nigeria."  Salz stated that by </p><p>Nigerian law, all flaring should halt in 2008; ExxonMobil has </p><p>set 2005 to eliminate gas flaring at all of its facilities. </p><p>Salz said the major problem in halting gas flaring was the </p><p>NNPC, which holds 60% of the JV to ExxonMobil\'s 40%.  The </p><p>NNPC\'s budget has been cut by the GON and will likely not be </p><p>able to provide its share of the $2.5 billion project to halt </p><p>gas flaring, he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: Through the NNPC, the GON owns the </p><p>controlling interests in all joint ventures or production </p><p>sharing contract production blocks with oil companies.  The </p><p>NNPC, which relies on the GON for its annual budget, has been </p><p>unable to provide its share of the capital investments </p><p>required to fund gas flaring reduction facilities.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Political Machinations Complicate Problem </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Senator Bingaman remarked that, meeting earlier in </p><p>the day, Nigerian President Obasanjo told the CODEL that gas </p><p>flaring would end by 2004.  Salz responded that the current </p><p>pace of GON investment would not sustain the President\'s </p><p>prediction.  Salz added, "Nigeria has been slow to stop gas </p><p>flaring because it is easier to flare than to re-inject or </p><p>sell it." ChevronTexaco\'s Howard then said that though there </p><p>is a huge potential market for natural gas in Nigeria, it is </p><p>not profitable to produce and sell because, in part, the GON </p><p>keeps electric and natural gas prices low. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Capps reported that Conoco would halt oil flaring as </p><p>soon as its only oil field runs dry, probably in 2004. </p><p>Concoco\'s future projects will not flare gas.  Howard said </p><p>that ChevronTexaco has started projects to halt gas flaring </p><p>by the GON\'s mandated 2008 date, and hopes to complete them </p><p>by 2007.  Bingaman asked the executives why the NNPC was not </p><p>acting to halt gas flaring sooner.  ExxonMobile\'s Salz </p><p>believes the problem is money, for which there are many </p><p>demands in the GON.  He explained that last year the GON gave </p><p>NNPC $3.1 billion of which ExxonMobile\'s budget was $1.3 </p><p>billion.  This year that budget was cut by $350 million to </p><p>$950 million.  Simply spoken, the GON penalizes oil companies </p><p>for flaring, but does not provide NNPC the funding necessary </p><p>to end it.  Nigeria is still not very environmentally </p><p>conscious and a reduction of flaring, the executives </p><p>speculated, may not be as politically attractive as other </p><p>potential uses of the limited government funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Uncertainty in Natural Gas Regime Makes Investors Wary </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Senator asked about plans to build natural gas </p><p>power plants that would use the gas now being flared. </p><p>ChevronTexaco\'s Howard said the lack of an integrated policy </p><p>on natural gas hurts development of the gas and power </p><p>industries.  For example, the GON tries to stimulate the gas </p><p>industry by taxing profits at 30 per cent (as compared to 70 </p><p>per cent for oil).  But another measure, entry of capital </p><p>goods duty free, was revoked recently as a way to gather </p><p>revenue.  A USAID Officer also noted that the GON has not </p><p>decided how to administratively divide up the natural gas </p><p>portfolio.  A lack of clear administrative guidelines and the </p><p>unclear pricing and regulatory policy in power generation and </p><p>natural gas have dampened interest by potential investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>75 per cent flared is probably too high </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Bingaman asked whether the WB estimate that Nigeria </p><p>flares 75 per cent of its natural gas was accurate.  The oil </p><p>executives replied in unison that they thought the figure too </p><p>high.  Oil companies must provide monthly flaring reports to </p><p>the GON and the NNPC should be able to provide an accurate </p><p>number.  The Senator stated that he was concerned about the </p><p>flaring issue and would try to build support in the Senate </p><p>for the WB\'s initiative to reduce gas flaring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Comment: Inadequate GON funding of the NNPC bodes </p><p>poorly for a reduction in Nigeria\'s gas flaring at the rate </p><p>the companies plan.  This does not mean that the GON is </p><p>disinterested in gas flaring.  A high GON energy sector </p><p>priority is to become a major player in the natural gas </p><p>market.  To do so, Nigeria must start capturing the gas it </p><p>now burns.  The hurdle is that the GON\'s current budgetary </p><p>squeeze makes it difficult to invest significant funds to end </p><p>gas flaring in the short-term.  Because of the GON\'s </p><p>financial constraints, this is an issue we must continue to </p><p>push if we are to get more rapid GON movement to end the </p><p>environmentally damaging gas flaring. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
