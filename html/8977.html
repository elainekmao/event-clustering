<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ELIOTT ABRAMS </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/RA LAWSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, JO, MEPN </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE RED SEA - DEAD SEA CONVEYANCE PROJECT:  A </p><p>CONDUIT FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION: Sunday afternoon\'s </p><p>World Economic Forum (WEF) panel session on the Red Sea - </p><p>Dead Sea canal was noteworthy for the first-ever public </p><p>meeting of the Palestinian Minister of Planning, the Israeli </p><p>Minister of National Infrastructure, and the Jordanian </p><p>Minister of Water and Irrigation to discuss the project. </p><p>Jordan has historically been the most aggressive proponent </p><p>of the project (and probably has the most to gain), with </p><p>Israel supportive, and the Palestinian Authority (PA) often </p><p>marginalized.  Some politics crept into the forum when the </p><p>Israelis showed their reservations by talking of the </p><p>Palestinians as "potential partners"-clearly signaling a </p><p>longstanding concern that recognizing a Palestinian right to </p><p>the Dead Sea might constrain the Israeli position in </p><p>subsequent territorial negotiations.  Similarly, the </p><p>Palestinians raised their political concerns that the </p><p>project might compromise their negotiating position on water </p><p>rights, a prickly final status issue.  Despite these </p><p>political concerns, both the Israelis and Palestinians </p><p>expressed great interest in further pursuing the project. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The WEF panel did not directly address the cost </p><p>(estimated at between $10-13 million) of a comprehensive </p><p>feasibility study outlined in the draft Terms of Reference </p><p>(TOR) prepared by the World Bank, and only the Jordanian </p><p>minister hinted at the $1 billion needed for the initial </p><p>phase of the expected $5-6 billion project.  In a subsequent </p><p>discussion with the Jordanian Minister of Water and </p><p>Irrigation, he shared with us that his government as well as </p><p>the Israeli government each are committed to contribute $1 </p><p>million towards the feasibility study.  He also told us that </p><p>the Swiss government offered $1 million and the Italians are </p><p>expected to make an unspecified contribution as well.  The </p><p>minister confided to us that the three parties would be </p><p>forwarding a formal request to Washington to help finance </p><p>the feasibility study with other international donors. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) We recommend that Washington encourage the </p><p>Jordanians, Palestinians, and Israelis to reach agreement on </p><p>the TOR so that it meets each of the parties\' requirements. </p><p>Once the three core parties invite the U.S. to become </p><p>involved, we should participate to the extent possible to </p><p>facilitate the regional cooperation.  Finally, we recommend </p><p>that the U.S. join the international donor group already </p><p>forming to help finance the comprehensive feasibility study. </p><p>END SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE POLITICAL CONTEXT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Jordan River Basin is shared by five </p><p>riparians-Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and the PA-and </p><p>plays a critical role in their individual and collective </p><p>well-being.  Water is also an important element in regional </p><p>cooperation and security.  Water will continue to be an </p><p>important part of any future agreement among all </p><p>beneficiaries of the Basin and may well serve as key </p><p>contributor to a foundation for comprehensive peace, </p><p>security, and cooperation in the region. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A trilateral Jordanian/Israeli/U.S. initiative from </p><p>the mid-1990s declared the Jordan Rift Valley a strategic </p><p>development zone.  The objective of this initiative is to </p><p>strengthen economic integration and cooperation through </p><p>development and construction of infrastructure and services </p><p>between Jordan and Israel, supported by public and private </p><p>sector investments.  Plans intended to help with the </p><p>integrated water resources planning and management of the </p><p>Jordan Rift Valley, have been developed through a </p><p>consultative process among Israel, Jordan, and the PA and </p><p>with assistance from the donor and the financial </p><p>communities.  The proposed Red Sea - Dead Sea Water </p><p>Conveyance Project (RDP) is one such scenario.  The RDP </p><p>concept is one of the projects being promoted by Jordan and </p><p>Israel, and indirectly by the PA. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) As articulated by the parties, individually and/or </p><p>jointly, notably at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable </p><p>Development last year and at the Third World Water Forum in </p><p>Kyoto this spring, the shared public vision of the RDP is: </p><p> </p><p>--"saving" the Dead Sea; </p><p>--making drinking water available at affordable prices to </p><p>  Jordan, Israel, and the PA; </p><p>--building a symbol of peace and cooperation in the region. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The RDP would constitute a major opportunity for </p><p>the stakeholders to work together to prepare, construct, and </p><p>operate the project.  The PA has been following the </p><p>proceedings without being directly involved up to this </p><p>point.  It will be important in the near future for the PA </p><p>to be directly involved in the feasibility study process. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) If water resources management is to be established </p><p>on a cooperative basis, a process and a framework for </p><p>cooperation need to be developed.  Global interest in this </p><p>project and the sustainability of water resources in the </p><p>region will greatly depend on the degree of cooperation </p><p>demonstrated by the beneficiary parties. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) While currently sharing water through water rights </p><p>and treaties, Jordan, Israel, and the PA may find it to </p><p>their advantage, individually and collectively, to move </p><p>towards sharing the benefits that can be generated from the </p><p>water and the shared vision.  The RDP, if proven feasible, </p><p>could well provide a practical vehicle for working together </p><p>to bring this about. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE TECHNICAL CONCEPT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The concept of an inter-sea transfer between the </p><p>Red Sea and Dead Sea has been studied in many forms since </p><p>the 1800s and more seriously since the mid-20th century. </p><p>The 400-meter difference in elevation between the Red Sea </p><p>and the Dead Sea creates a gravity flow advantage and </p><p>considerable potential for the generation of hydropower. </p><p>The present concept, stemming from earlier peace </p><p>negotiations between Jordan and Israel, proposes an </p><p>alignment from the Red Sea that generally follows the border </p><p>between the two countries, but lies entirely in Jordanian </p><p>territory. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Under consideration is a design that places a high </p><p>priority on restoration of the Dead Sea and involves three </p><p>phases:  (1) Red Sea water conveyed to the Dead Sea via a </p><p>conduit; (2) a desalination facility to be built close to </p><p>the Dead Sea to produce potable water from part of the water </p><p>transferred and to provide energy; and (3) potable water </p><p>distribution via pipelines to municipalities in Jordan, the </p><p>PA, and Israel. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Transferring water from the Red Sea to the Dead </p><p>Sea means many things to the stakeholders and beneficiaries, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>--arresting and reversing the environmental degradation of </p><p>  the Dead Sea region; </p><p>--protecting a unique region of the world with cultural, </p><p>  religious, and political significance; </p><p>--driving economic development of the Dead Sea area, </p><p>  focusing on the expansion of tourism activities and the </p><p>  protection of the extractive potash industry; </p><p>--involving government entities in the region to work </p><p>  together on a major project of mutual interest, </p><p>  increasing the prospects for stability, security, and </p><p>  prosperity in the region; </p><p>--alleviating the medium- to long-term drinking water needs </p><p>  in Jordan, Israel, and the PA. </p><p> </p><p>At times, the project has been viewed as a water supply </p><p>project with positive environmental benefits, while more </p><p>recently it has been promoted as an environmental project </p><p>with potential water supply benefits--probably a result of </p><p>pandering to environmental sensitivities. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) At the request of Jordan, the World Bank recently </p><p>developed the TOR for a feasibility study on the latter </p><p>approach to the RDP.  The principal objective of the </p><p>feasibility study is to help determine whether or not the </p><p>concept of transferring water from the Red Sea to the Dead </p><p>Sea makes environmental and economic sense, and what would </p><p>be the impact of the project on the region.  There has been </p><p>a particular environmental concern about the effect of </p><p>mixing the two waters whose properties are significantly </p><p>different from each other.  Although the scope of the TOR is </p><p>somewhat limited geographically and technically, it is </p><p>designed to be carried out within a comprehensive </p><p>development framework with a multidisciplinary approach, </p><p>involving the full range of economic, financial, technical, </p><p>environmental, social, and political issues. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION:  We were extremely </p><p>pleased to see the Jordanians, Palestinians, and Israelis </p><p>jointly promote the RDP at the recent extraordinary meeting </p><p>of the WEF.  It was the first such public declaration of </p><p>intent by the three parties to move forward on the RDP. </p><p>Previous fora, such as last year\'s Johannesburg World Summit </p><p>on Sustainable Development, only brought together the </p><p>Jordanians and Israelis.  Despite some minor political </p><p>statements on the part of both the Israeli and Palestinian </p><p>ministers, the tri-lateral support for the project was </p><p>clearly there.  We also found broad support for the project </p><p>from other WEF attendees.  To the extent possible, the U.S. </p><p>should support the Jordanians, Palestinians, and Israelis as </p><p>they seek to develop the TOR of the RDP feasibility study </p><p>acceptable to all.  We understand that the three parties </p><p>will formally request the U.S. government to participate </p><p>shortly.  Given the apparent commitment by Jordan and Israel </p><p>to partially finance the feasibility study, as well as the </p><p>willingness of the Swiss and Italians to also contribute to </p><p>its cost, we recommend that Washington join the </p><p>international donor consensus. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
