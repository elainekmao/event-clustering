<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA </p><p>DEPT PASS TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, JONES </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE EURO CHANGEOVER IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 2002 MILAN 14 (B) 01 ROME 6222 </p><p>(C) 01 MILAN 728  (D) 01 MILAN 666 </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPLACES ROME 01059 DATED FEBRUARY 28, 2002, WHICH WAS </p><p>CANCELLED. </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: ITALYS TRANSITION TO THE EURO WENT SMOOTHLY, WITH </p><p>ONLY A FEW SNAGS  PRINCIPALLY IN THE SOUTH.  ITALIANS STOPPED </p><p>USING LIRE ON FEBRUARY 28, ALTHOUGH THE BANKING ASSOCIATION, </p><p>AT THE REQUEST OF THE BANK OF ITALY, HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE </p><p>FOR EXCHANGING LIRE FOR EUROS UNTIL JUNE 30.  OPINIONS ARE </p><p>MIXED ABOUT THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGEOVER. </p><p>OFFICIAL DATA SHOW A MODEST IMPACT, WHILE CONSUMER </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS ARGUE THAT THE INFLATIONARY EFFECT WAS FAR </p><p>HIGHER, BUT NOT CAPTURED BY OFFICIAL STATISTICS. ITALYS FIRST </p><p>COUNTERFEIT EUROS HAVE BEEN FOUND. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A LONG CHANGEOVER </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ITALIAN EURO CHANGEOVER PERIOD WAS ONE OF THE LONGEST </p><p>AMONG THE 12 EU COUNTRIES THAT ADOPTED THE NEW CURRENCY. </p><p>GERMANY, NETHERLANDS, IRELAND AND FRANCE ALREADY FINISHED </p><p>THEIR CHANGEOVER.  ITALY WAS TO HAVE FINISHED BY FEBRUARY 28, </p><p>BUT, AT THE REQUEST OF THE CENTRAL BANK, THE ITALIAN BANKING </p><p>ASSOCIATION EXTENDED THE CHANGEOVER PERIOD FOR FOUR ADDITIONAL </p><p>MONTHS UNTIL THE END OF JUNE. THE EURO WILL BE THE ONLY LEGAL </p><p>CURRENCY IN ITALY STARTING MARCH 1, BUT CUSTOMERS MAY CHANGE </p><p>LIRE INTO EUROS, FREE OF CHARGE, AT BANKS UNTIL JUNE 30. </p><p>THERE WILL BE SOME CONDITIONS: THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED PER </p><p>EXCHANGE WILL BE 1,000,000 LIRE (516 EURO) PER DAY FOR </p><p>CHECKING ACCOUNT HOLDERS BUT ONLY 500,000 (258 EURO) DAILY FOR </p><p>OTHER CUSTOMERS.  LARGER TRANSACTIONS WILL REQUIRE MORE </p><p>NOTICE.  POST OFFICES, WHICH ACCEPT CURRENCY PAYMENTS FOR </p><p>UTILITIES, SAVINGS PLANS, ETC., ARE CONSIDERING EXTENDING THE </p><p>CHANGEOVER PERIOD. AFTER MID-JUNE, CUSTOMERS MAY STILL CHANGE </p><p>LIRE INTO EUROS AT BANK OF ITALY BRANCHES UNTIL FEBRUARY 2012, </p><p>FREE OF CHARGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALY IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY OF THE EURO-ZONE THAT HAS </p><p>EXTENDED THE CHANGEOVER PERIOD FOR BANKS.  BANKS IN FRANCE, </p><p>LUXEMBOURG, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN WILL EXCHANGE NATIONAL </p><p>CURRENCY FOR EUROS, FREE OF CHARGES, UNTIL END-JUNE.  ANOTHER </p><p>FOUR COUNTRIES (AUSTRIA, FINLAND, GREECE AND IRELAND) ARE </p><p>DISCUSSING A POSSIBLE EXTENSION.  IN THE NETHERLANDS, EXCHANGE </p><p>WILL BE POSSIBLE UNTIL THE END OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>CHANGEOVER DATA </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ITALIAN CHANGEOVER WENT SMOOTHLY, BUT THERE ARE STILL </p><p>LIRE BANKNOTE CIRCULATING, NOTICEABLY IN SUPERMARKETS, </p><p>SHOPPING CENTERS, MALLS AND RESTAURANTS. THE OVERALL VALUE OF </p><p>LIRE CIRCULATING IN ITALY AT THE END OF 2001 WAS 120 TRILLION </p><p>LIRE, EQUIVALENT TO 62 BILLION EURO.  ACCORDING TO THE BANK OF </p><p>ITALY, MORE THAN 1.6 BILLION LIRE BANKNOTE HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN </p><p>FROM CIRCULATION, VALUED AT ABOUT 90 TRILLION LIRE (46.5 </p><p>BILLION EURO).  THERE ARE REMAINING 30 TRILLION LIRE (15.5 </p><p>BILLION EURO) OR 25 PERCENT OF LIRE VALUE STILL IN </p><p>CIRCULATION.  MOST LARGE LIRE BANKNOTES HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED </p><p>FOR EUROS.  DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THE CHANGEOVER, 1.6 BILLION </p><p>LIRE IN BANKNOTES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN CIRCULATION AFTER </p><p>FEBRUARY 28, MOSTLY IN SMALL DENOMINATIONS.  THE EXTENSION OF </p><p>THE LIRA/EURO EXCHANGE DEADLINE IS EXPECTED TO HELP SMALL </p><p>SHOPKEEPERS, THE ELDERLY AND OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN SLOW </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE EURO CHANGEOVER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION, DURING THE </p><p>CHANGEOVER, ITALIAN BANKS HAVE WITHDRAWN 100 TRILLION LIRE </p><p>(51.6 BILLION EURO) SO FAR AND ARE EXPECTED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>ANOTHER 110 TRILLION (56.8 BILLION EURO) BY THE END OF </p><p>FEBRUARY. (COMMENT: THE DATA REFER TO LIQUIDITY CONVERTED FROM </p><p>LIRE TO EURO SO FAR, WITH NO IMPACT ON OVERALL LIQUIDITY.) </p><p> </p><p>INCREASE OF CREDIT CARD USE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CREDIT CARD USE IN ITALY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN </p><p>THE PAST SIX MONTHS.  ACCORDING TO LUCIANA STRIPPOLI OF </p><p>AMERICAN EXPRESS ITALY, THE NUMBER OF AMEX CARDS REQUESTED IN </p><p>2001 GREW BY 35 PERCENT, WITH THE LARGEST INCREASE REGISTERED </p><p>IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR, RIGHT BEFORE THE EUROS </p><p>INTRODUCTION.  THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS WITH AMEX CREDIT </p><p>CARDS INCREASED BY 20 PERCENT IN JANUARY 2002 OVER THE </p><p>CORRESPONDING MONTH IN 2001.  STRIPPOLI SAID THAT IT IS HARD </p><p>TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO, BUT </p><p>BELIEVES MOST CONSUMERS REQUESTED A CREDIT CARD BECAUSE THEY </p><p>FELT MORE SECURE USING A CARD INSTEAD OF CASH.  MAURIZIO </p><p>CARTOCCI, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF SERVIZI INTERBANCARI, ITALYS </p><p>FIRST ISSUER OF CREDIT CARDS, SAID THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN </p><p>CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS OF 15-18 PERCENT IN THE FIRST WEEKS </p><p>OF THE YEAR.  SSB (SOCIETY OF BANKING SERVICES) SAID THAT </p><p>TRANSACTIONS USING DEBIT CARDS REGISTERED A 57 PERCENT </p><p>INCREASE IN THE FIRST WEEKS OF THE EURO. </p><p> </p><p>ONE- AND TWO-CENT COINS DEBATE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  LATE IN JANUARY, ECONOMY MINISTER GIULIO TREMONTI </p><p>MENTIONED THAT GOI IS CONSIDERING FOLLOWING FINLANDS LEAD AND </p><p>ELIMINATING ITS SMALLEST EURO COINS.  TREMONTI TOLD REPORTERS </p><p>THAT GETTING RID OF THE TINY ONE- AND TWO-CENT COINS WOULD </p><p>CERTAINLY WIN THE FAVOR OF ITALIAN CITIZENS AND SAID HE WAS </p><p>CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE IDEA.  BUT THE MINISTER, WHO WAS </p><p>CRITICIZED AS A EURO-SKEPTIC IN THE WAKE OF HIS COOL </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW SINGLE CURRENCY, </p><p>STRESSED THAT SUCH DECISIONS SHOULD NOT BE UNILATERAL. CALLS </p><p>FOR SUCH A PRACTICE ARE GAINING MOMENTUM IN ITALY.  THE MAYOR </p><p>OF THE NORTHEASTERN CITY OF TREVISO, GIANCARLO GENTILINI, SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO TREMONTI URGING THE ELIMINATION OF THE </p><p>COINS.  GENTILINI SAID HE HAD HAD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM </p><p>CITIZENS EXASPERATED BY THESE TWO MICROSCOPIC COINS.  OUR </p><p>WALLETS ARE ALREADY STUFFED TO OVERFLOWING WITH THE BIGGER </p><p>COINS.  THE CENTS WERE FINE BEFORE WORLD WAR II, WHEN MANY </p><p>PEOPLE DIED WITHOUT EVER TASTING THE JOY OF HANDLING A </p><p>THOUSAND LIRE BANKNOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GIANCARLO DEL BUFALO, OF THE EURO COMMITTEE OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE, DEFENDED THE EURO-CENTS, </p><p>WHICH ALLOWED A MORE PRECISE CONVERSION OF LIRE PRICES INTO </p><p>EURO PRICES.  ECHOING THE OPINION OF FINANCE MINISTRY </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY VITO TANZI, DEL BUFALO SAID THE MARKET WOULD BE </p><p>THE ULTIMATE ARBITRATOR OF THE TYPE OF COINS USED. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  ACCORDING TO A MID-FEBRUARY SURVEY BY THE UNION OF ITALIAN </p><p>CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND THE POLLING COMPANY TAGLIACARNE </p><p>INSTITUTE, THE CHANGEOVER WAS SMOOTH. THE SUPPLY OF EUROS IN </p><p>BANK CHANNELS WAS SUFFICIENT IN MOST CASES: ONLY 17 PERCENT OF </p><p>THOSE POLLED HAD PROBLEMS WITH OBTAINING EUROS AT BANKS. POST </p><p>OFFICES DID EVEN BETTER: ONLY 11 PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED HAD </p><p>PROBLEMS OBTAINING EUROS AT POST OFFICES.  WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>PRICE HIKES, 37 PERCENT SAID THAT EURO PRICES FOR GOODS AND </p><p>SERVICES HAD INCREASED FROM THE LIRE PRICES. (THIS CONTRASTS </p><p>WITH A MUCH GREATER NUMBER -- 55 PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED </p><p>WHO SAID IN JANUARY THAT EURO PRICES WERE HIGHER.) THE POLL </p><p>SHOWED A LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN ITALY </p><p>IN TERMS OF EURO SUPPLY AND PRICE INCREASES.  FORTY-ONE </p><p>PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED IN THE SOUTH SAID THEY HAD </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES AT THE POST OFFICE, WHILE ANOTHER 32 </p><p>PERCENT SIGNALED THE SAME DIFFICULTIES AT BANKS.  SEVENTY- </p><p>SEVEN PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE SURVEYED IN THE SOUTH LAMENTED </p><p>UNJUSTIFIED PRICE INCREASES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN THE SOUTH, LONG LINES AT BANKS AND POST OFFICES </p><p>PERSISTED THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY.  EVEN AS THE FEBRUARY 28 </p><p>DEADLINE APPROACHED, MANY TRANSACTIONS IN SMALL SHOPS WERE </p><p>STILL BEING CARRIED OUT IN LIRE.  TAXIMETERS, WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>CONVERTED TO EUROS IN ROME SOON AFTER THE NEW YEAR, STILL </p><p>SHOWED PRICES IN LIRE IN NAPLES AS RECENTLY AS LATE FEBRUARY. </p><p>SHOPKEEPERS IN NAPLES FREQUENTLY HAVE PROBLEMS MAKING CHANGE, </p><p>AS MOST CASH DRAWERS CONTAIN FAR MORE LIRE THAN EUROS. </p><p>DESPITE THE INITIAL CONFUSION, AND THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE </p><p>TO THE NEW CURRENCY, BANCO DI NAPOLI OFFICIALS MINIMIZED THE </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH THE CHANGEOVER IN THE SOUTH.  THEY BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE PROCESS OF ADAPTATION WILL ACCELERATE QUICKLY ONCE THE </p><p>LIRA LOSES ITS VALUE AS LEGAL TENDER. </p><p> </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGEOVER </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT, IN SEVERAL SECTORS, PRICES </p><p>WERE ROUNDED UP TO FACILITATE THE EURO CONVERSION.  ONLY AFTER </p><p>FIRST QUARTER RESULTS ARE IN WILL A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE BE </p><p>POSSIBLE.  OFFICIAL STATISTICS INDICATE A 0.5 PERCENT INCREASE </p><p>IN PRICES FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH BOTH IN JANUARY AND </p><p>FEBRUARY.  IN PARTICULAR, PRICE FIGURES FROM TWENTY ITALIAN </p><p>CITIES, RELEASED ON FEBRUARY 21, INDICATE THAT THE YEAR-TO- </p><p>YEAR INFLATION RATE INCREASED FROM 2.4 PERCENT IN DECEMBER AND </p><p>JANUARY TO 2.5 PERCENT IN FEBRUARY.  CENTRAL BANK CONTACTS SAY </p><p>A 0.7 PERCENT INCREASE IN INFLATION IS LIKELY IN THE FIRST </p><p>QUARTER BECAUSE OF THIS ROUNDING UP. THIS INCREASE WILL NOT BE </p><p>EASILY ABSORBED DURING THE YEAR AND COULD PUSH THE YEARLY </p><p>AVERAGE INFLATION RATE CLOSE TO TWO PERCENT.   THERE WAS SOME </p><p>ROUNDING DOWN AS WELL, WHICH COMPENSATED FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF </p><p>THE ROUNDING UP. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF ITALYS LARGEST INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION, CONFINDUSTRIA, CONSIDERS THE ACCELERATION OF </p><p>INFLATION A TEMPORARY EFFECT OF THE CHANGEOVER, AND BELIEVES </p><p>THAT THE DECELERATION WILL START IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. </p><p>HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 2002, THE </p><p>CONFINDUSTRIA ESTIMATE OF AN INFLATION RATE OF 1.5 PERCENT IN </p><p>2002 HAS HAD TO BE REVISED UPWARD TO ABOUT 2.0 PERCENT.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE AND THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO TRUST IN THE ANTI-INFLATIONARY </p><p>MECHANISMS SET UP BY THE GOI, AND PREDICT THAT THE CHANGEOVER </p><p>WILL HAVE ONLY A MODEST INFLATIONARY IMPACT.  OTHER GOI </p><p>CONTACTS PREDICT THAT ADDITIONAL PRICE INCREASES MAY OCCUR ON </p><p>MARCH 1, WHEN THE LIRA IS TAKEN OUT OF CIRCULATION.  CARLO </p><p>RIENZI, PRESIDENT OF THE LEADING CONSUMER ASSOCIATION, </p><p>CODACONS, FORESEES SUBSTANTIAL PRICE INCREASES STARTING MARCH </p><p>1, WHEN LIRE PRICES WILL NO LONGER BE POSTED FOR COMPARISON. </p><p>FROM THAT DAY, JUNGLE LAW WILL PREVAIL, RIENZI SAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, ADICONSUM, CODACONS AND UNIONE </p><p>CONSUMATORI, SAY THAT THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT IS HIGHER THAN </p><p>THE GOI HAS REPORTED. THESE ASSOCIATIONS PLAN TO APPEAL TO </p><p>ISTAT, THE CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS, WHICH IS IN CHARGE </p><p>OF THE CALCULATION AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRICE DATA, </p><p>REQUESTING THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW INDEX AND THE </p><p>METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE ASSOCIATIONS, THE JANUARY DATA DO NOT MEASURE THE REAL </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE EURO CHANGEOVER, WHICH, THEY SAY, </p><p>MAY EQUAL AN AVERAGE INFLATION OF THREE PERCENT THIS YEAR. </p><p>THE ASSOCIATIONS ESTIMATE THAT PRICES WILL INCREASE BY 14 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2002 ON AVERAGE, WITH A LOSS OF PURCHASING POWER OF </p><p>557.77 EURO (USD 490) A YEAR PER HOUSEHOLD, APPROXIMATELY 40 </p><p>TO 50 EUROS PER MONTH.  THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS RECENTLY </p><p>PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET HIGHLIGHTING PRICE INCREASES.  HIGHWAY </p><p>TOLLS ROSE BY 2.21 PERCENT, NATIONAL TELEVISION FEES BY 1.46 </p><p>PERCENT, LOTTERY TICKET PRICES BY 1.6 PERCENT FROM 5,000 LIRE </p><p>(EURO 2.58) TO THREE EUROS.  IN MILAN, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION </p><p>TICKETS INCREASED BY 29.1 PERCENT, FROM 1,500 LIRE (EURO 0.77) </p><p>TO ONE EURO. </p><p> </p><p>MONEY-LAUNDERING AND COUNTERFEITING </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE EURO HAS BLACK-MARKET BENEFITS THAT THE DOLLAR CANNOT </p><p>MATCH.  THE SINGLE CURRENCY GLIDES WITHOUT A TRACE ACROSS A </p><p>NEWLY BORDER-LESS EUROPE IN BILLS DENOMINATED IN LARGE VALUES </p><p>SCARCELY SEEN IN THE REGION.  THE E500 NOTE  THE HIGHEST </p><p>DENOMINATION - IS ALSO ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE VALUE OF THE </p><p>LARGEST DOLLAR NOTE IN CIRCULATION, THE USD 100 BILL.  WHETHER </p><p>MEASURED BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME, THIS MEANS MORE EUROS CAN BE </p><p>JAMMED INTO A BRIEFCASE THAN DOLLARS OR OLD EUROPEAN </p><p>CURRENCIES. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE, </p><p>THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO INCREASED THE RISKS OF MONEY- </p><p>LAUNDERING.  THE PERIOD OF DOUBLE CIRCULATION LIRA-EURO </p><p>REPRESENTS THE LAST CHANCE FOR HOLDERS OF ITALIAN LIRE OF </p><p>ILLICIT ORIGIN TO TRY TO RECYCLE THROUGH THE CONVERSION IN </p><p>EURO OR THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND INVESTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ON FEBRUARY 19, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SEIZED NEAR </p><p>ROME 25,000 COUNTERFEIT 50 AND 200 EURO BANKNOTES.  THIS IS </p><p>THE FIRST SEIZURE OF COUNTERFEIT BANKNOTES IN ITALY, WHICH </p><p>WERE APPARENTLY OF HIGH QUALITY.  COMMENT: THERE HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>A NOTABLE INCREASE IN COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY IN ITALY. LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AT POST  AND IN ITALY IN GENERAL -- </p><p>SAID THAT THEY EXPECTED A SIGNIFICANT UPSWING IN COUNTERFEIT </p><p>EUROS IN THE FIRST WEEKS AFTER ITS INTRODUCTION, AS </p><p>COUNTERFEITERS TESTED THE MARKETS AWARENESS ABOUT THE </p><p>EUROS APPEARANCE.  HOWEVER, THE EUROS SECURITY FEATURES SEEM </p><p>TO HAVE DISSUADED COUNTERFEITING, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AT </p><p>POST COMMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>THE THAI THREAT & OTHER STORIES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE EURO HAS ITS DOUBLES.  THANKS TO THE SIMILARITY </p><p>BETWEEN THE OLD 500 LIRE COINS AND THE TWO-EURO COINS (BOTH </p><p>BI-METALLIC AND WITH ALMOST THE SAME WEIGHT) IN THE FIRST DAYS </p><p>OF THE CHANGEOVER, MANY OLD 500 LIRE COINS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED </p><p>FOR SMALL PAYMENTS IN PLACE OF THE TWO-EURO COINS. THE 500- </p><p>LIRE COIN IS VERY SIMILAR, BUT IS WORTH ONLY ONE-EIGHTH (26 </p><p>EURO CENTS) OF A TWO-EURO COIN. </p><p> </p><p>17.  UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS ANOTHER THREAT.  THE THAI 10-BAHT </p><p>COIN IS A PERFECT TWIN OF THE TWO-EURO COIN, BUT IS WORTH ONLY </p><p>25 EURO CENTS.  ANECDOTALLY, WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME TEN-BAHT </p><p>COINS HAVE BEEN USED IN AUTOMATIC CIGARETTE AND BEVERAGE </p><p>DISPENSING MACHINES. </p><p> </p><p>ROME MISCELLANY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF ROMES 365 AUTOMATIC BUS TICKET </p><p>DISPENSERS ACCEPT EURO COINS.  ATAC, THE ROME CITY </p><p>TRANSPORTATION AGENCY, PROMISED THAT ALL WOULD ACCEPT EUROS BY </p><p>THE END OF FEBRUARY.  AN ESTIMATED FIVE-PERCENT OF GASOLINE </p><p>STATIONS DID NOT ACCEPT EURO BANKNOTES BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. </p><p>BY MARCH 1, ALL PARKING METERS WILL ACCEPT THE EURO. </p><p></p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  DESPITE THE INITIAL INCONVENIENCE, THE ITALIAN TRANSITION </p><p>WAS SMOOTHER AND FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND MORE ITALIANS </p><p>ACCEPTED EUROS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. TOO MANY SMALL LIRE </p><p>BANKNOTES STILL CIRCULATE OR AT LEAST REMAIN TO BE EXCHANGED. </p><p>THE BANKING ASSOCIATIONS DECISION TO PROLONG THE ACCEPTANCE </p><p>PERIOD FOR LIRE SEEMS WISE, GIVEN THE 1.6 BILLION LIRA </p><p>BANKNOTES (WITH AN OVERALL VALUE OF 15.5 BILLION EURO) IN </p><p>CIRCULATION. THE ORIGINAL FEBRUARY 28 DEADLINE FOR EXCHANGING </p><p>THESE NOTES MIGHT HAVE MEANT A LAST MINUTE CRUNCH, WHICH COULD </p><p>HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS DELAYS IN BANKS AND POST OFFICES.  WE ARE </p><p>MONITORING THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGE TO EUROS, AND </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.  WE WILL ALSO KEEP </p><p>ON EYE ON WHETHER THERE IS ANY DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES (OR </p><p>INCREASED DEMAND FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES) AS ITALIANS BEGIN </p><p>TO NOTICE COST DIFFERENTIALS FOR THEIR HIGH-PRICED GOODS AND </p><p>SERVICES COMPARED TO THEIR EURO-ZONE NEIGHBORS.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
