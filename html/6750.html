QUOTE: </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "Time to curb U.S. bully tactics" </p><p>      the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" (03/23) </p><p>      an  opinion article by the newspaper\'s Political Editor, </p><p>      Munyaradzi Huni.  Huni accuses the United States and </p><p>      Britain of leading a campaign "to spread imperialism." </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "My heart bleeds for the people of Iraq.  May the </p><p>      powerful and all-conquering God see to it that good </p><p>      triumphs over evil.  But, if I may ask: `What the </p><p>      hell does the U.S. think it is anyway. . .?\'  Over </p><p>      300,000 U.S.-led forces are already reducing Iraq to </p><p>      ashes. . .not only to remove Saddam Hussein from </p><p>      power but to spread imperialism in that region. </p><p>      America knows that defeating Saddam Hussein is the </p><p>      first and biggest step in conquering the Moslems </p><p>      around the world.  All the talk about weapons of </p><p>      mass destruction is just propaganda to justify the </p><p>      killing of innocent lives in Iraq.  Mr. Blair knows </p><p>      the price for not supporting America. . .  If </p><p>      Britain fails to support America, Mr. Blair knows </p><p>      that once Mr. Bush finishes the project in other </p><p>      countries, the guns will be turned on his country. </p><p>      So while Iraq is thousands of kilometers away, what </p><p>      is happening there could happen to Zimbabwe because </p><p>      the reasons why they are bombing Iraq are the same </p><p>      reasons why they imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. </p><p>      It\'s all about spreading this new kind of </p><p>      colonialism. . .  Once they finish the project in </p><p>      Iraq. . .Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair are likely to turn </p><p>      their attention to North Korea, another country they </p><p>      accuse of having weapons of mass destruction.  After </p><p>      North Korea, no one really knows where the bombs </p><p>      will be pounding, but one thing that is certain is </p><p>      that Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair\'s efforts to spread </p><p>      imperialism will continue because their madness and </p><p>      hunger to rule the world knows no bounds.  Isn\'t it </p><p>      time this madness is put to a quick stop. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN UNQUOTE </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>End Cable Text </p><p> </p><p>Kathleen M Raynor  08/31/2005 02:38:28 PM  From  DB/Inbox:  Search Results </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recipient/Profile Information </p><p>Cable Recipients: </p><p>- No Recipients - LMDS Profiles/Office Symbols: </p><p> PAS </p><p>POL </p><p>DCM </p><p>AMB CableXpress Folders: </p><p>  - No Folders - </p><p></p></div>
