<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EU, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: MESIC SPEECH AT EMBASSY OPENING FAILS TO BOOST </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1296 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) On June 13, President Mesic attended the ceremonial </p><p>opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Zagreb.  The Ambassador </p><p>used the festive occasion to declare that the imposing, </p><p>state-of-the art chancery is a concrete example of the United </p><p>States\' long-term commitment to Croatia.  Rather than use his </p><p>remarks on this occasion to step away from GoC actions which </p><p>have harmed the bilateral relationship (ref), the approach </p><p>and tone of Mesic\'s speech was disappointing and open to </p><p>interpretation.  While he did note some positive elements of </p><p>the U.S. - Croatia relationship, he also raised contentious </p><p>subjects like the U.S. use of sanctions to punish other </p><p>states, the possibility that the U.S. would seek to </p><p>marginalize the UN or seek to slow the progress of EU </p><p>unification.  While Mesic rejected the idea that "the U.S. </p><p>would even think about" these actions, he seemed to be </p><p>conveying his doubts about U.S. policies.  Mesic went on to </p><p>re-assert Croatia\'s sovereignty and declared that the U.S. </p><p>should accept "a Croatia which uses its own head much more </p><p>than a Croatia reduced to a subservient role." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Our GoC interlocutors were quick to point out that </p><p>Mesic does not represent the formal position of PM Racan\'s </p><p>government.  Indeed, since Mesic was elected, he has been a </p><p>willing partner with the Government in limiting the role of </p><p>Croatia\'s presidency in an effort to prevent recurrence of </p><p>the excesses of the Tudjman regime.  Croatia\'s President now </p><p>plays more of a ceremonial role, and his statements are at </p><p>times less nuanced than the GoC positions; that was certainly </p><p>the case last month when he called U.S. action in Iraq </p><p>"illegitimate." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) After the Embassy ceremony, we called President </p><p>Mesic\'s Foreign Policy Adviser Tomislav Jakic (the likely </p><p>author of the speech) to express our dissatisfaction with the </p><p>message delivered.  We told him -- and other GoC </p><p>interlocutors -- that we thought the occasion and location </p><p>was inappropriate for such an ambiguous and condescending </p><p>message.  We also told him the message itself was wrong and </p><p>unhelpful.  Jakic was defensive, saying the speech was </p><p>intended to reject unequivocally the criticisms of U.S. </p><p>policy, but said he would inform the president. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Begin text of Mesic address: </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Rossin, </p><p>Distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps, </p><p>Distinguished guests, </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> </p><p>I am pleased to be able to attend the ceremonial opening of </p><p>the new Embassy of the United States of America in the </p><p>Republic of Croatia.  I wanted to be here today in order to </p><p>affirm in this way as well Croatia\'s friendly feelings </p><p>towards the United States.  And I also wanted to see at close </p><p>range and visit this impressive structure.  This is the best </p><p>response to all those who speculate about the United States </p><p>losing interest in this part of the world and in Croatia. </p><p> </p><p>Our two countries have long-standing relations.  They can be </p><p>traced to the fairly distant past, to the time when many </p><p>Croats and people from Croatia, then part of the </p><p>Austro-Hungarian Empire, left in order to seek a place in the </p><p>sun on the other side of the ocean, in the New World.  There </p><p>is no need to recall the names of famous individuals who have </p><p>come from our lands and made a significant contribution to </p><p>the development and progress of the United States. </p><p> </p><p>Similarly, there is no need to recall what the United States </p><p>had done on the global scale, but also within the scope of </p><p>our bilateral relations, in promoting democracy, freedom and </p><p>human rights.  Let me repeat: there is no need to recall all </p><p>that, because we know it.  I would simply like to say the </p><p>following: Croato-American relations have always been, and </p><p>will be, relations of taking and giving on both sides. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, our relations have passed through different </p><p>phases, they have seen their ups and downs.  But at any </p><p>moment we in Croatia have seen and experienced ourselves as </p><p>sincere friends of the United States. </p><p> </p><p>There have been and there are no anti-American feelings in </p><p>Croatia.  We have always been and we are friends of the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>United States.  However, just as in any relations, it takes </p><p>two to sustain relations of friendship.  In other words, the </p><p>United States also ought to understand that our friendship is </p><p>sincere and durable even when our thinking about a particular </p><p>issue may differ from the thinking in Washington, D.C. </p><p> </p><p>We know that the United States has been the firm mainstay of </p><p>the free world.  Therefore, we know that this excludes the </p><p>possibility that the United States might even think of </p><p>punishing any of its friends, with whom it shares the same </p><p>values and ideals, for remaining true to the fundamental </p><p>tenets of international relations - the freedom of </p><p>individuals and nations and their full equality. </p><p> </p><p>We know that the United States played an irreplaceable role </p><p>in the foundation of the United Nations, and that it should </p><p>be given the credit, perhaps more than anybody else, for the </p><p>sustenance of the world organization in times and conditions </p><p>which were anything but propitious.  Therefore, we reject any </p><p>thought that the United States could even think of </p><p>marginalizing the global organization or even refrain from </p><p>supporting it and thereby endanger its very survival. </p><p> </p><p>We know that the project of united Europe, in the difficult </p><p>and extremely dangerous times of the cold war and of the </p><p>East-West confrontation, could not even have started without </p><p>the sincere and full support of the great ally on the other </p><p>side of the Atlantic.  Therefore, we believe that any </p><p>speculations according to which the United States does not </p><p>regard European unification with the same enthusiasm with </p><p>which its supported that millennial project for decades to be </p><p>absurd and utterly unfounded. </p><p> </p><p>Today Croatia sees and realizes its place in the world within </p><p>the circle of democratic countries, in the ranks of the </p><p>global antiterrorist coalition, in the United Nations, and </p><p>tomorrow - both in the European Union and the NATO.  We have </p><p>never pursued our foreign policy by relying now on this </p><p>country, or group of countries, and now on another. </p><p> </p><p>In line with the same principles, we want to have equally </p><p>good relations with all countries, large and small, powerful </p><p>and less powerful ones alike. </p><p> </p><p>We are aware of our European identity but also our global </p><p>orientation. </p><p> </p><p>We are aware, of course, of the specific role and place of </p><p>the United States in the world in which we live.  It is </p><p>therefore completely clear that one of our foreign policy </p><p>priorities is the continuation and broadening of good </p><p>relations and even of alliance with the United States. </p><p> </p><p>But we are an independent, sovereign state, and until we </p><p>transfer, by our own free will, part of our sovereignty to </p><p>the European Union, we shall make our own decisions, bearing </p><p>in mind first and foremost the interest and welfare of our </p><p>citizens - over the short and long term alike. </p><p> </p><p>We shall always be ready to listen to others, but we also </p><p>expect others to be sensitive to us.  Knowing the history of </p><p>the United States, we are certain that it will best </p><p>understand such a position and know to appreciate a Croatia </p><p>which uses its own head much more than a Croatia reduced to a </p><p>subservient role. </p><p> </p><p>Let me take this opportunity to convey cordial and friendly </p><p>greetings to President George Bush and to the American people. </p><p>Let me also wish the diplomatic representative of the United </p><p>States, who will now work in this modern and impressive </p><p>building at the outskirts of our capital, a pleasant </p><p>performance of their duties in this traditionally friendly </p><p>environment, geared to the continuous progress and </p><p>development of ever better, mutually beneficial relations </p><p>between our two countries. </p><p>End Text. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
