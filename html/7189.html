(A) Toronto 00906 </p><p> </p><p>     (B) Ottawa 00899 </p><p>     (C) Toronto 00886 </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. In Canada the provincial governments have the </p><p>primary responsibility for health matters, including </p><p>managing public health emergencies.  The federal </p><p>authorities nevertheless do play an important </p><p>coordination role between the provinces, with other </p><p>countries and the WHO.  In addition to that role the </p><p>federal authority, Health Canada, has specialized </p><p>laboratory assets as well as public health specialists, </p><p>available to assist the provinces.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Federal Role </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. On March 26, the Government of Ontario declared </p><p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to be a </p><p>provincial emergency (Ref B).  SARS is now a reportable </p><p>disease under Ontario\'s Health Protection and Promotion </p><p>Act.  Ontario provincial health authorities have </p><p>extended restrictive hospital measures to all hospitals </p><p>in the province (Ref A) and thousands of residents of </p><p>Toronto have been asked to quarantine themselves at </p><p>home for 10 days.  This response underscores the fact </p><p>that primary public health monitoring and infectious </p><p>disease response is managed at the provincial level. </p><p> </p><p>3. Under the Canadian constitution, the provinces have </p><p>primary responsibility for managing health issues, </p><p>including public health and disease surveillance </p><p>matters.  There is, nevertheless, a significant role </p><p>for the Canadian federal authorities and the federal </p><p>government possesses key assets that support the </p><p>provincial efforts. </p><p> </p><p>4. John Rainford, Crisis Communications Chief at Health </p><p>Canada explained the specific federal role in managing </p><p>the SARS outbreak. </p><p> </p><p>-- Health Canada issues travel advisories on behalf of </p><p>the federal government with regard to travel to foreign </p><p>location.  Health Canada\'s travel advisories are </p><p>available at the Health Canada website: www.hc- </p><p>sc.gc.ca. They currently advise against travel to </p><p>Hanoi, China including Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. </p><p> </p><p>-- The federal authorities are the focal point for </p><p>Canadian coordination with the World Health </p><p>Organization (WHO).  For example, when the WHO issued a </p><p>global alert for cases of atypical pneumonia on March </p><p>12, 2003, Health Canada immediately notified all </p><p>provinces and territories.  Health Canada is also the </p><p>focal point for coordination with other international </p><p>partners such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control </p><p>and Prevention (CDC).  Rainford told us that CDC and </p><p>Health Canada staff are currently serving in exchange </p><p>position at one another\'s Emergency Response Centers to </p><p>help manage the SARS issue. </p><p> </p><p>-- Health Canada operates Canada\'s "National </p><p>Microbiology Laboratory", a level 4 Bio-containment </p><p>facility and laboratory located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, </p><p>where the Canadian search for the SARS infectious agent </p><p>is being conducted.  We understand that this facility </p><p>is also a member of the CDC network of laboratories and </p><p>we understand that its staff is in frequent </p><p>communication with their CDC counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Health Canada provides assistance to the provincial </p><p>health authorities.  For example twelve federal </p><p>epidemiologists have been sent to Toronto assist </p><p>provincial public health authorities during the current </p><p>SARS situation. </p><p> </p><p>-- The federal government has powers relating to entry- </p><p>exit controls.  After being informed of the SARS </p><p>situation, the federal government immediately activated </p><p>protocols to track potentially infected passengers </p><p>arriving from the epicenters in Vietnam and China.  In </p><p>instances where a returning passenger shows SARS </p><p>symptoms, the passenger manifests for that person\'s </p><p>flights to Canada have been examined and provincial or </p><p>territorial public health authorities are in touch with </p><p>the other passengers to determine if any other </p><p>passengers demonstrate SARS symptoms.  Health Canada </p><p>also began distributing Health Alert Notices to </p><p>international passengers arriving in or returning </p><p>directly to Canada from affected areas in Asia, which </p><p>advised passengers to see a physician if they began to </p><p>have symptoms related to SARS (Ref A).  Also, Health </p><p>Canada has sent quarantine officers to Pearson </p><p>(Toronto), Vancouver and Dorval (Montreal) </p><p>International Airports to support airport staff. </p><p> </p><p>-- In a worst-case scenario, the federal government </p><p>could invoke the Quarantine Act.  The following summary </p><p>is from Health Canada: "The Quarantine Act would </p><p>authorize Health Canada to detain persons, goods or </p><p>conveyances on suspicion that the persons, goods and </p><p>conveyances might introduce a dangerous communicable </p><p>disease into Canada. The authority permits detention </p><p>without due process for a period of 48 hours in order </p><p>to undertake a medical examination of persons, analysis </p><p>of goods or inspection of conveyances. If detention is </p><p>required beyond 48 hours, Health Canada must present </p><p>evidence for a continuation of the detention in a </p><p>federal court. These powers also apply to persons and </p><p>conveyances leaving Canada for another country." </p><p>Health Canada emphasizes that this Act would only be </p><p>invoked if necessary and that such an action is not </p><p>being considering at this time. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. Health Canada officials are taking the SARS public </p><p>health situation very seriously, as evidenced by the </p><p>support they have provided to the provincial </p><p>authorities and measures taken to screen passengers at </p><p>airports.  Health Canada is collaborating closely and </p><p>coordinating efforts with their counterparts across </p><p>Canada, including the Chief Medical Officers of Health </p><p>in each province and territory.  Furthermore, they are </p><p>confident that, as and when SARS cases are identified, </p><p>they will be able to meet any additional provincial </p><p>requests for assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
