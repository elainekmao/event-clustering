<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  SENATE LAYS GROUND FOR BERLUSCONI\'S TRIAL-FREE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ROME 2495  B) ROME 2284  C) ROME 1971 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Before Italy assumes the EU Presidency </p><p>on July 1, the Italian Parliament is virtually guaranteed </p><p>to pass legislation suspending trials against the country\'s </p><p>top five institutional leaders, likely quashing the </p><p>possibility of embarrassing corruption hearings against </p><p>Prime Minister Berlusconi during the six-month Presidency, </p><p>and indeed for the duration of his term.  The GOI is also </p><p>seeking limited parliamentary immunity in the same </p><p>legislation, utilizing a previously-introduced bill </p><p>implementing the Constitution, rather than a constitutional </p><p>amendment.   The legislation passed the Senate handily on </p><p>June 5, and passage by the Chamber of Deputies and full </p><p>effectiveness are expected before the end of June.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On June 5, the Senate passed a bill which would </p><p>provide for the suspension of trials against the country\'s </p><p>top five institutional leaders (the Presidents of the </p><p>Republic, the Constitutional Court, the Senate, and the </p><p>Chamber, and the Prime Minister) during their terms of </p><p>office.  The law would not provide total immunity for the </p><p>named positions.  The President of the Republic could still </p><p>be accused and tried by Parliament for high treason and </p><p>attacks on the Constitution, as foreseen in Article 90 of </p><p>the Constitution.  Likewise, the Prime Minister could be </p><p>tried, with Parliamentary approval, for offenses committed </p><p>in exercising his role, according to Article 96.  The </p><p>officials would also be subject to investigation, but </p><p>trials could not begin until the person leaves office.  The </p><p>statute of limitations clock stops for the duration of the </p><p>individual\'s term.  (COMMENT:  In a tactical maneuver which </p><p>probably adds to opposition wrath, the governing coalition </p><p>took to calling this part of the legislation the "Lodo </p><p>Maccanico."  "Lodo" implies an uncontroversial agreement, </p><p>and "Maccanico" is the name of a respected center-left </p><p>Senator who last year proposed similar legislation.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The same legislation seeks to expand parliamentary </p><p>immunity.  Prior to the 1990\'s "Tangentopoli" </p><p>("Bribesgate") corruption scandal, Article 68 of the </p><p>Constitution guaranteed full immunity to parliamentarians </p><p>during their terms of office.  In 1993, after the uproar </p><p>created when Parliament rejected the magistracy\'s request </p><p>to investigate former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, Article </p><p>68 was revised to permit investigations and prosecution </p><p>without previous parliamentary authorization.  (Arrest, </p><p>wiretaps, or search still require parliamentary approval.) </p><p>The present bill would reinstate immunity from </p><p>investigation and prosecution related to all parliamentary- </p><p>related activities.  (Currently, only votes and opinions </p><p>are protected.)  Magistrates would also need parliamentary </p><p>permission to use information from a wiretap if a </p><p>parliamentarian were one of the speakers, even if s/he was </p><p>not the focus of the investigation.  (COMMENT:  In another </p><p>galling (for the opposition) irony, the legislative </p><p>proposal was appended to a bill introduced by Greens Deputy </p><p>Marco Boato, who sought to restrict judicial phone taps of </p><p>legislators.  Boato, needless to say, has demanded that his </p><p>name be removed from the legislation.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The legislation is drafted as a law to implement </p><p>the Constitution, not as a constitutional amendment.  An </p><p>amendment would require two readings, three months apart, </p><p>in each house, and probably a referendum as well, likely </p><p>about a year-long process.  This appears to be a precedent- </p><p>setting approach, although the erstwhile "Boato Law" would </p><p>have relied on the same technique.  It now goes to the </p><p>Chamber of Deputies, where it is expected to pass on June </p><p>20-21.  It will take full effect the day after it is signed </p><p>by the President of the Republic and published in the </p><p>official gazette, normally the day after final passage.  As </p><p>planned, this would be well in time for the beginning of </p><p>the EU presidency, even allowing about a week for the dust </p><p>to settle. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The opposition is divided on this issue.  The </p><p>more centrist Union of Democrats of Europe (UDEUR) and </p><p>Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) abstained on the Senate </p><p>vote (a tacit sign of support) and can be expected to do </p><p>the same in the Chamber, while the further left parties </p><p>have indicated they will present a referendum to abolish </p><p>the law.  (If they succeed, the referendum could not be </p><p>held before Spring of 2004.)  The opposition charges </p><p>(correctly) that the bill seeks to freeze the on-going </p><p>judicial bribery trial against Prime Minister Berlusconi </p><p>(Ref B).  The center-right counters it is needed to </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>safeguard the institutional figure of the Prime Minister in </p><p>light of Italy\'s impending EU presidency.  Some in the </p><p>opposition have charged that the legislation is </p><p>unconstitutional because it provides separate treatment for </p><p>the five high-level institutional figures.  President </p><p>Ciampi has weighed in, calling on all to tone down their </p><p>rhetoric, which makes Italy look bad in the run-up to the </p><p>EU presidency.  It seems clear the GOI has received </p><p>Ciampi\'s green light (explicitly or implicitly) that the </p><p>legislation passes constitutional muster in his eyes. </p><p>Meanwhile, the center-right has also presented a draft </p><p>constitutional amendment, mirroring that passed recently by </p><p>the EU Parliament (with the support of center-left Euro </p><p>Parliamentarians). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Given the Government\'s majority, it is </p><p>safe to say the legislation will pass prior to the </p><p>beginning of the Italian EU Presidency.  This should rid </p><p>the Prime Minister of the worry of corruption hearings in </p><p>the midst of the Presidency, and indeed for the remainder </p><p>of his term.  The only wrinkle is that the same Milan court </p><p>accused by Berlusconi and his supporters of politicized </p><p>justice (Refs B and C) has the right to request a </p><p>Constitutional Court review of the legislation when it </p><p>passes.  Although Italian justice is known for grinding </p><p>exceptionally slowly, we cannot rule out lightning action </p><p>by the Constitutional Court.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02529 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
