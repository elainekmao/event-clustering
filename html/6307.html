<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MOPS, IZ, CA, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ/UNSC: CANADA STILL WORKING - AT THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVELS - TO "BRIDGE THE DIVIDE" </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) USUN NEW YORK 656 (B) OTTAWA 589 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As seen from Canada\'s proposal for a new UNSC </p><p>resolution on Iraq (reftel A), the GoC continues to be active </p><p>in seeking a compromise solution at the Security Council. </p><p>Officials at the Prime Minister\'s Office (PMO), the Privy </p><p>Council Office (PCO), and Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) have </p><p>confirmed to us that GoC efforts on Iraq are being personally </p><p>handled by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, PCO Foreign Policy </p><p>Advisor Claude Laverdure, and Canada\'s Ambassador to the UN </p><p>Paul Heinbecker.   PMO\'s Paul Genet told the DCM that </p><p>Laverdure has the lead on Iraq.  DFAIT\'s Jon Allen told us </p><p>that Heinbecker had been "chomping at the bit" to put forward </p><p>a Canadian proposal at the UN.  PCO\'s Rob Fonberg (protect) </p><p>told the DCM "there is no question that the Prime Minister is </p><p>in the lead," but that the Iraq file is being handled </p><p>primarily by PCO, with only limited input by DFAIT.  Fonberg </p><p>also speculated that Clerk of the Privy Council Alex </p><p>Himelfarb, a staunch multilateralist, has been advising </p><p>Chretien not to do anything in Iraq without UN support, or </p><p>perhaps even with it. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Commodore Dan McNeil, Laverdure\'s Director of </p><p>Operations and Strategic Planning, told us that the Prime </p><p>Minister continues to be heavily engaged in lobbying Security </p><p>Council heads of state.  Chretien spoke again with British </p><p>Prime Minister Blair on March 12, and was to speak again </p><p>later that day with Chilean President Lagos and Mexican </p><p>President Fox.  McNeil expressed concern that Lagos might </p><p>support the French position, which Canada found unacceptable, </p><p>and that Mexico was considering a proposal for the UN to </p><p>deploy 50,000 blue helmets in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) McNeil reiterated to us that Canada\'s objectives are </p><p>(1) disarmament of Iraq and (2) the Security Council living </p><p>up to its obligations.  Canada knows the U.S. cannot keep its </p><p>military forces in a holding pattern much longer, he </p><p>continued, and Canada\'s proposal sets a concrete deadline for </p><p>action (April 15) if Iraq does not meet disarmament targets. </p><p>McNeil said Chretien recognizes war is now inevitable, but </p><p>that he must reckon with anti-war sentiment in Canada, </p><p>including in his own Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: While Chretien realizes we do not support the </p><p>GoC proposal, he sees the need for a UNSC compromise and will </p><p>remain personally engaged to try to achieve it.  Given </p><p>France\'s determination to veto any resolution sanctioning </p><p>military action, Canada\'s best hope now is for a resolution </p><p>supported by most Security Council members.  Like the </p><p>British, Canada would seize upon such a vote as expressing </p><p>the will of the Security Council, albeit without passage due </p><p>to veto. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
