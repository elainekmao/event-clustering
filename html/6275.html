<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Victory? Not yet" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (3/11): "...The </p><p>truth is that nothing has yet been \'won\' in Iraq - </p><p>notwithstanding the wishful thinking we hear from Mr. </p><p>Chretien, French President Jacques Chirac and the other </p><p>world leaders whose desperation to avoid war is </p><p>blurring into appeasement. The battle will not be won </p><p>until Iraq is fully disarmed - a goal that, more and </p><p>more, would seem to require the removal of Saddam </p><p>Hussein to be achieved." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Saddam has to go, but we can\'t trust Bush to do </p><p>it" </p><p>Retired political reporter and columnist Anthony </p><p>Westell observed in the leading Globe and Mail (3/11): </p><p>"... I\'m in favour of using force if necessary to </p><p>remove Mr. Hussein. But, and here\'s the rub, the man </p><p>who has the force is Mr. Bush, and he, too, I fear, is </p><p>showing signs of megalomania. He loves being a </p><p>president at war. See him strut, hear his bellicose </p><p>speeches to his troops. And remember that Iraq is only </p><p>the first part of his grand strategy. He plans to </p><p>reorganize the Middle East - and, it appears, </p><p>any other part of the world that offends him.... [But] </p><p>how can I reconcile these two views - that we should </p><p>remove Saddam Hussein, by force if necessary, but that </p><p>Mr. Bush is not the man we can trust with the task? My </p><p>answer is probably idealistic. Unless Mr. Hussein </p><p>proves he has disarmed and steps down, I think the </p><p>Security Council should vote to remove him and </p><p>replace his regime with a temporary UN administration, </p><p>using force if necessary, but a measured force, applied </p><p>by troops in blue helmets and under UN command. If Mr. </p><p>Bush agreed to commit U.S. forces under those </p><p>conditions, good. But I know that\'s highly unlikely, </p><p>and there would be no way now to stop him from acting </p><p>alone. In that case, the lesson for the Security </p><p>Council should be that it is time, past time, to create </p><p>a multinational military force able to enforce its </p><p>rulings." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Saddam doesn\'t have a prayer" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "The Iraqi dictator\'s greatest </p><p>miscalculation was to toy with the Bush administration </p><p>after Sept. 11. Now there\'s no turning back," columnist </p><p>Drew Fagan suggested in the leading Globe and Mail </p><p>(3/11) that, "...It may be that the Bush administration </p><p>gambled from the start - using disarmament as a </p><p>smokescreen for regime change, using the UN to give </p><p>credibility to a fundamentally unilateral policy. If </p><p>so, the pretext is </p><p>falling away. But Mr. Hussein\'s calculations have been </p><p>infinitely more reckless. He has brought on himself </p><p>what appears to be the imminent destruction of his </p><p>government and the occupation of his country. Mr. </p><p>Hussein won\'t have to live with the aftermath. The rest </p><p>of the world does. They should hope that the war that </p><p>now appears all but certain goes as well as </p><p>the Americans have planned. This is one Hail Mary pass </p><p>that, if thrown, must be completed successfuly." </p><p> </p><p>4.   "Tide turns against Bush" </p><p>Columnist Thomas Walkom wrote in the liberal Toronto </p><p>Star (3/11): "The Iraq crisis is no longer about </p><p>stopping Iraq. It is about stopping the United </p><p>States.... Most countries outside the U.S. are no </p><p>longer worried about rogue Iraqi dictator Saddam </p><p>Hussein. They are worried about rogue American </p><p>President George W. Bush.... For now it is not Iraq, a </p><p>minor Middle Eastern power, that is in potential </p><p>defiance of the U.N. system, but the mighty U.S. </p><p>In effect, Bush has served notice that the painstaking </p><p>logic of collective security, which the U.S. itself did </p><p>so much to create 58 years ago, is to be junked. War is </p><p>to be no longer a last resort but an active part of </p><p>superpower foreign policy. Decisions on the </p><p>international order are to be made not at the U.N. but </p><p>in Washington alone. The sovereignty of other </p><p>nations is now to be wholly contingent upon U.S. </p><p>geopolitical interests. No wonder the rest of the world </p><p>is nervous. No wonder that France, Germany, </p><p>Russia and (maybe) China have forged their unlikely </p><p>peace coalition." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Test Iraq\'s will to fully disarm" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/11): </p><p>"...Obsessed with toppling Saddam, Bush has trotted out </p><p>one dubious rationale after the other for war: </p><p>To destroy weapons the U.N. isn\'t sure Saddam </p><p>possesses. To guard against the possibility he might </p><p>give weapons to Al Qaeda, when no Baghdad-9/11 axis </p><p>exists. To punish Saddam for befriending other </p><p>terrorists. To defend the U.N.\'s honour. To liberate </p><p>Iraqis from a despot. To defend Israel. To safeguard </p><p>oil. To democratize the Mideast. Because 250,000 U.S. </p><p>troops can\'t be kept waiting forever. And now to spare </p><p>Bush an embarrassing climbdown. This dizzy reasoning </p><p>has sown discord at the U.N., in the North Atlantic </p><p>Treaty Organization and in the European Union. Bush\'s </p><p>threat to ignore the U.N. has led to criticism that he </p><p>is acting like a scofflaw himself.... The U.N. can </p><p>legitimately demand that Baghdad `disarm\' or face </p><p>attack, as the U.S. wants. But not without defining </p><p>what that implies. And not without giving the Iraqis a </p><p>chance to comply." </p><p> </p><p>6.   "An untutored, unprepared president will be </p><p>running this war" </p><p>Former Washington correspondent and professor of </p><p>journalism and international affairs at Carleton </p><p>University, Andrew Cohen pointed out in the nationalist </p><p>Ottawa Citizen (3/11) that, "...[President Bush] hasn\'t </p><p>seen war, as JFK or Truman did, or pondered the future, </p><p>as Lincoln did, which would make him more credible. Why </p><p>won\'t he disavow the interests of oil? Does he </p><p>challenge the hawks? Does he demand more information? </p><p>His lack of perception and curiosity make even those </p><p>who support intervention wish this </p><p>were Al Gore\'s War. He sees Iraq as a question of </p><p>security, pure and simple, and security is a </p><p>president\'s greatest responsibility. The dangers - the </p><p>damage to the United Nations, the alienation of old </p><p>allies, the challenge of Iraq after Saddam - are of </p><p>less consequence. In these matters, he is innocent of </p><p>nuance. Without great experience or knowledge, Mr. Bush </p><p>does have faith. He reads short inspirational homilies. </p><p>Religion allows him to see things in black and white - </p><p>evil or America, peace or chaos - which may be the only </p><p>way to see Saddam Hussein. As he makes the most </p><p>important decision a president can, he is said to be </p><p>keeping his own counsel. In the end he may well do the </p><p>right thing for the wrong reasons in Iraq, and it may </p><p>make him courageous, resolute and wise. One hopes so. </p><p>In the meantime, Mr. Bush on the brink is simply </p><p>frightening." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
