<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 005018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR T, PM, PM/B AND S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREL, PREL, IT, KICC, ITKICC, ITKICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: ARTICLE 98 DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: COPENHAGEN 3183 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05018  01 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>NS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) IN MEETINGS AT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE ICC/ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT NEGOTIATING </p><p>TEAM PRESENTED A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE U.S. POSITION </p><p>AND RATIONALE FOR OUR DRAFT ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT TEXT. </p><p>ITALIAN COUNTERPARTS UNDERSCORED THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE EU </p><p>GUIDELINES WHILE STATING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO STRETCH THOSE </p><p>GUIDELINES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO MEET U.S. NEEDS, A </p><p>WILLINGNESS DERIVING FROM PM BERLUSCONI\'S DETERMINATION TO </p><p>WORK WITH US TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE.  BOTTOM LINE: AVOIDING </p><p>COVERAGE OF ALL U.S. NATIONALS IS THE ONLY REDLINE FOR THE </p><p>GOI; THE ITALIANS STATED ART. 98 (1) ALREADY COVERS CURRENT </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THIS COVERAGE COULD BE STRETCHED TO COVER </p><p>FORMER OFFICIALS.  ART. 98 (2), THEY ADDED, MIGHT BE EXTENDED </p><p>TO ANYONE WHO COULD BE DEFINED AS HAVING AN OFFICIAL LINK TO </p><p>THE USG (I.E., WHO IS THEREFORE "SENT" IN SOME WAY).  THEY </p><p>SUGGESTED THESE ISSUES COULD BE WORKED OUT IN THE TEXT OF A </p><p>BILATERAL PROTOCOL OR AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SUPPLEMENT </p><p>EXISTING ACCORDS.  THE ITALIANS STATED THE NATO SOFA, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, WAS AN EXISTING AGREEMENT THAT PROTECTED U.S. </p><p>FORCES, THE CIVILIAN COMPONENT, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS, FROM </p><p>SURRENDER TO THE ICC.  IN CLOSING, THE ITALIAN SIDE WELCOMED </p><p>FURTHER DETAILED DISCUSSIONS, AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THIS </p><p>ROUND OF TALKS IN EUROPE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05018  01 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>REAFFIRMATION OF BERLUSCONI\'S COMMITMENT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  IN A MEETING AT PALAZZO CHIGI OCT. 10, PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR AMBASSADOR GIOVANNI </p><p>CASTELLANETA REITERATED THE ITALIAN LEADER\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>HELP THE U.S. FIND A WAY FORWARD ON THE ISSUE OF THE ICC THAT </p><p>PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT AND YET MEETS THE NEEDS </p><p>OF THE U.S. WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONCERNS REGARDING THE COURT </p><p>AND ITS JURISDICTION.  CASTELLANETA, WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED IN </p><p>THE MEETING BY POLITICAL DIRECTOR GIANCARLO ARAGONA AND OTHER </p><p>AIDES, TOOK PAINS TO OUTLINE TO PM ADVISOR LINO AND DEPUTY </p><p>CHIEF OF MISSION SKODON THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONSIDERED THIS ISSUE.  HE ALSO NOTED </p><p>-- A THEME REPEATED BY ARAGONA THE NEXT DAY -- THE EXTENT TO </p><p>WHICH ITALY WAS KEY IN HELPING TO ENSURE THE EU DECISION AT </p><p>THE GAC SEPTEMBER 30 PERMITTED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH THE U.S. PROPOSAL.  LINO </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR ITALY\'S RECENT OFFER OF ALPINI </p><p>TROOPS FOR OEF AND FOR THE ITALIAN INTERCESSION WITHIN THE EU </p><p>TO ACHIEVE THE BEST RESULT POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>U.S. PRESENTATION ON ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT DRAFT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) A HALF-DAY MEETING AND WORKING LUNCH OCT. 11 COMPLETED </p><p>THE TALKS WITH THE GOI.  POLITICAL DIRECTOR ARAGONA LED THE </p><p>ITALIAN SIDE; HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY UMBERTO LEANZA (HEAD OF </p><p>THE MFA LEGAL OFFICE,) AND RAFFAELE DE LUTIO (HEAD OF THE MFA </p><p>UN OFFICE.) ON THE U.S. SIDE, AMBASSADOR LINO WAS ACCOMPANIED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05018  01 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>BY LARA BALLARD (L/PM,) CDRS. DAVE GROGAN (OSD) AND PATRICK </p><p>MCCARTHY (OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL, DOD.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE U.S. TEAM\'S PRESENTATION ADDRESSED THE EU\'S </p><p>GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THE GOI FELT </p><p>IT HAD SUFFICIENT LATITUDE TO AGREE TO THE DRAFT U.S. ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT.  WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING AGREEMENTS, THE </p><p>ITALIANS AGREED THAT THE NATO SOFA CONSTITUTED AN AGREEMENT </p><p>CONTEMPLATED UNDER ARTICLE 98(2) AND THAT AS A RESULT, U.S. </p><p>FORCES, THE CIVILIAN COMPONENT, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS WOULD </p><p>NOT BE SUBJECT TO SURRENDER TO THE ICC.  THEY ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>THE TWO SIDES SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH </p><p>OTHER AGREEMENTS, SUCH AS EXTRADITION AGREEMENTS, PROVIDE THE </p><p>PROTECTIONS THE U.S. SEEKS.  WITH RESPECT TO THE EU POINT </p><p>REGARDING "IMPUNITY," THE GOI STATED EMPHATICALLY THAT THIS </p><p>WAS NOT AN ISSUE, AS NO ONE WITHIN THE EU DOUBTED THE U.S. </p><p>COMMITMENT TO PROSECUTE WAR CRIMINALS.  THE U.S. TEAM ALSO </p><p>RAISED THE ISSUE OF RECIPROCITY, INDICATING THAT WHILE THERE </p><p>WAS NO PROBLEM CONCLUDING A NON-RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT, </p><p>CONCERNS EXISTED WITH THE WAY THE EU PHRASED ITS </p><p>NON-RECIPROCAL GUIDELINE BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS APPROXIMATELY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2764 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05018  02 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>ACTION T-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  PERC-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /002W </p><p>                  ------------------F792C2  151619Z /38 </p><p>O 151539Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6324 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 005018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR T, PM, PM/B AND S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KICC, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: ARTICLE 98 DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALY </p><p> </p><p>20,000 SERVICEMEMBERS WHO ARE NOT U.S. CITIZENS.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>EU GUIDELINES STATE THAT ONLY NATIONALS OF NON-PARTY STATES </p><p>CAN BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, A RESULT THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05018  02 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMMITMENT UNDER THE NATO SOFA </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE FOREIGN NATIONALS IN THE U.S. ARMED FORCES. </p><p>END NOTE.)  THE U.S. SIDE ALSO RAISED THE POINT THAT OTHER </p><p>USG EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS MIGHT NOT BE U.S. CITIZENS.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN SIDE INDICATED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS WORKABLE BUT </p><p>FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON U.S. SERVICEMEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE DISCUSSION THEN FOCUSED ON THE MEANING AND EFFECT </p><p>OF ART. 98(2) WITH REGARD TO "SCOPE."  THE ITALIAN SIDE </p><p>SEEMED FAMILIAR WITH THE U.S. ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE MEANING OF </p><p>"SENDING STATE."  THE U.S. SIDE PRESENTED AND ELABORATED ON </p><p>THE RATIONALE PRESENTED IN COPENHAGEN (REFTEL): ART. 98(2) </p><p>WAS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE MEANING ASCRIBED IN THE NATO SOFA, </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF THE TERM "SENDING STATE" IN ART. 98(2) DID </p><p>NOT RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF PERSONS WHO COULD BE COVERED BY AN </p><p>ART. 98 AGREEMENT, AND THERE WAS NO COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>WHAT MIGHT CONSTITUTE A "SENT" PERSON UNDER THE EU\'S READING </p><p>OF ART. 98(2).  THE U.S. TEAM ADDITIONALLY RAISED THE POINT </p><p>THAT THE FOUR 1949 GENEVA CONVENTIONS CREATED A REGIME UNDER </p><p>WHICH EACH HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY UNDERTOOK TO EITHER BRING </p><p>ACCUSED WAR CRIMINALS BEFORE THEIR OWN COURTS OR TURN OVER </p><p>SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO OTHER HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES FOR TRIAL. </p><p> ANY SURRENDER TO ANOTHER ENTITY, SUCH AS THE ICC, IS NOT </p><p>PROVIDED FOR IN THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS.  THUS, THE EU </p><p>INTERPRETATION OF ART. 98 (2) COULD PUT THE EU COUNTRIES IN </p><p>CONFLICT WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>ITALIAN REBUTTAL FOCUSES ON LIMITS OF EU GUIDELINES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05018  02 OF 03  151619Z </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  THE GOI SIDE REITERATED MOST OF THE ARGUMENTS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY ADVANCED BY THE EU WITH REGARD TO ART. 98(2) AND </p><p>THE DEFINITION OF "SENDING STATE," INDICATING IT SIMPLY COULD </p><p>NOT ACCEPT THAT ARTICLE 98(2) COULD ALLOW FOR THE EXEMPTION </p><p>OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT SENT BY A GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>SOME OFFICIAL CAPACITY.  HOWEVER, THE ITALIAN SIDE LATER </p><p>NOTED THAT THE GOI WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSTRUE THE </p><p>DEFINITION OF "SENT" AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE SO AS TO </p><p>ENCOMPASS, FOR INSTANCE, OLYMPIC ATHLETES, PEACE CORPS </p><p>VOLUNTEERS, INDIVIDUALS SENT ON CULTURAL EXCHANGES, AND ANY </p><p>PERSON WHO HAD SOME SORT OF OFFICIAL LINK WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  WHAT THE GOI COULD NOT DO WAS EXTEND COVERAGE TO </p><p>A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL WITH NO OFFICIAL "LINK" WHATSOEVER. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ARAGONA EXPLAINED THAT THE GOI\'S PROBLEM WITH THE </p><p>SCOPE OF COVERAGE SOUGHT BY OUR DRAFT AGREEMENT IS AS MUCH </p><p>POLITICAL AS LEGAL.  THE ITALIAN PUBLIC WOULD PERCEIVE SUCH </p><p>AN AGREEMENT AS A USG ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT THE ICC OR PLACE US </p><p>CITIZENS ABOVE THE LAW. PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL FOR ANY SUCH </p><p>AGREEMENT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>OBTAIN, INSISTED ARAGONA. WITH REGARD TO THE REFERENCES TO </p><p>THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS, THE ITALIAN RESPONSE WAS THAT THE </p><p>ROME STATUTE CHANGED THE CONTRACTING PARTIES\' OBLIGATION WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO SURRENDER OF PERSONS ACCUSED OF GRAVE BREACHES TO </p><p>OTHER CONTRACTING PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WITH REGARD TO FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE </p><p>ITALIAN SIDE SUGGESTED THAT THEY WOULD ALREADY ENJOY </p><p>"FUNCTIONAL IMMUNITY" UNDER ART. 98(1), AND THUS, IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE, THE GOI DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05018  02 OF 03  151619Z </p><p>ARTICLE 98 COVERAGE FOR FORMER OFFICIALS.  ITALIAN LEGAL </p><p>ADVISOR LEANZA POINTED OUT THAT MOST OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMES LISTED IN THE ROME STATUTE, BY DEFINITION, WOULD BE </p><p>CRIMES DIRECTED BY OFFICIALS.  WHEN THE U.S. SIDE ASKED HOW </p><p>FUNCTIONAL IMMUNITY COULD PROTECT FORMER USG OFFICIALS IF </p><p>THERE WERE SOME DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER SUCH A CRIME HAD </p><p>BEEN COMMITTED IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY, THE ITALIAN SIDE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE SCOPE OF ART. 98(1) COULD BE "CLARIFIED" </p><p>TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>ARAGONA SUMMARIZES THE ITALIAN POSITION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AT THE CLOSE OF THE SESSION, ARAGONA SUMMARIZED HOW </p><p>FAR THE GOI COULD BE EXPECTED TO GO AND STILL REMAIN </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ICC TREATY AND THE </p><p>GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE ICC.  HE REITERATED THAT, IN </p><p>ESSENCE, THE ONLY EU GUIDING PRINCIPLE AT ISSUE IS SCOPE.  HE </p><p>AGREED THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THOSE PERSONS COVERED UNDER </p><p>THE NATO SOFA, THE GOI COULD AGREE TO ARTICLE 98 COVERAGE FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2765 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05018  03 OF 03  151620Z </p><p>ACTION T-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  PERC-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /002W </p><p>                  ------------------F792D5  151620Z /38 </p><p>O 151539Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6325 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 005018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR T, PM, PM/B AND S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KICC, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: ARTICLE 98 DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALY </p><p> </p><p>ALL OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM THE U.S. SEEKS </p><p>PROTECTION UNDER THE US ARTICLE 98 MODEL TEXT, WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF COVERAGE FOR "ALL U.S. NATIONALS."

HE CONCLUDED BY STATING </p><p>THAT THE GOI DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE US TERMINATION </p><p>CLAUSE AND THAT ANY ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, WOULD, BY </p><p>NECESSITY, HAVE TO BE SENT TO THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR </p><p>APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) DISCUSSIONS REMAINED POSITIVE AND FRIENDLY THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE VISIT, WITH THE ITALIANS CLEARLY COMMITTED TO FINDING A </p><p>MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION THAT WOULD ADDRESS U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS.  THE U.S. TEAM TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD WITH </p><p>THE GOI\'S CONCURRENCE THAT FORMER USG OFFICIALS CAN BE </p><p>COVERED.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE ITALIANS\' SUGGESTION THAT SUCH </p><p>COVERAGE BE LINKED TO ART 98(1), AS AMBASSADOR ARAGONA SAID, </p><p>"THE DEVIL MAY BE IN THE DETAILS."  THE GOI UNAMBIGUOUSLY </p><p>AFFIRMED THAT THE NATO SOFA ALREADY PROTECTS U.S. FORCES, THE </p><p>CIVILIAN COMPONENT AND THEIR DEPENDENTS FROM SURRENDER TO THE </p><p>ICC, AND THE GOI REITERATED THE COMMENT MADE BY THE DANES </p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE USG\'S COMMITMENT </p><p>TO PROSECUTE WAR CRIMINALS.  BOTH OF THESE AFFIRMATIONS ARE </p><p>POSITIVE STEPS FORWARD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.
