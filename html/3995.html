END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>Reported Legal Trouble for GSL Proposal </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The government\'s proposed constitutional </p><p>amendment reining in the president\'s powers has run into </p><p>a major roadblock.  Our soundings confirm October 17 </p><p>press reports that the Supreme Court has apparently </p><p>decided the following (although it has not yet been </p><p>officially announced): </p><p> </p><p>-- In addition to needing two-thirds support in </p><p>Parliament, the part of the proposed amendment that </p><p>would rein in the power of the president to call an </p><p>election one year after the last election requires a </p><p>national referendum.  The effective transfer of the </p><p>power to call an election from the president to the </p><p>Parliament per the proposal is so "fundamental" that the </p><p>issue has to be put to a popular vote.  The court left </p><p>the door open for the GSL to rewrite this part of the </p><p>proposed amendment in some way that better protected </p><p>executive prerogatives.  (Note:  The last parliamentary </p><p>election was held in December 2001.  The government </p><p>pushed ahead on this effort to rein in President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s powers out of fear that she would call a </p><p>new election in December 2002, her first opportunity to </p><p>do so.) </p><p> </p><p>-- As for the other key section, the court reportedly </p><p>ruled that the proposal to allow crossover voting in </p><p>Parliament is basically unconstitutional.  In doing </p><p>this, the court apparently determined that the power of </p><p>party whips to control MPs was a right protected by the </p><p>constitution.  (Note:  The GSL wanted this provision in </p><p>place as a way to protect members of other parties who </p><p>decided to support the proposed amendment.  Without such </p><p>protection, members who vote against their party\'s </p><p>announced position can be tossed out of Parliament after </p><p>legal maneuvering.) </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  It is not clear when the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>official decision will be announced, but it is expected </p><p>soon.) </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>Government Lacking Support In Any Case? </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Supreme Court\'s apparent decision comes amid </p><p>reports that the GSL might not have the requisite two- </p><p>thirds support needed in Parliament to pass the proposed </p><p>amendment to begin with.  With a vote supposed to take </p><p>place in the next several weeks, the government does not </p><p>seem to have rallied enough support from other parties </p><p>to win.  In fact, the government\'s campaign for the </p><p>proposed amendment seems to be running out of steam as a </p><p>possible vote draws nearer. </p><p>4.  (C) Breaking down the numbers, Jehan Perera, the </p><p>director of a well-known think-tank, told us that the </p><p>government can only count on about 130 of the 150 MPs it </p><p>needs in the 225-member Parliament.  The governing </p><p>United National Party (UNP) is having trouble luring </p><p>members of President Kumaratunga\'s People\'s Alliance </p><p>(PA) party to its side, despite its initial success in </p><p>siphoning off a handful of PA MPs.  In addition, he </p><p>related, the UNP is even having trouble holding onto </p><p>members of its own coalition, such as MPs from the Sri </p><p>Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).  (Note:  Several SLMC MPs </p><p>are clearly frustrated with the GSL over the peace </p><p>process, especially the involvement of SLMC leader Rauf </p><p>Hakeem in the peace effort, and are playing hard to </p><p>get.)  In a sign of its success on the peace process </p><p>front, however, the UNP can count on the support of the </p><p>16 MPs of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Perera </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Mulling Over Other Options </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) A New Election?:  With its plans for the </p><p>proposed amendment in real disarray, the GSL is </p><p>reportedly mulling over the idea of calling a new </p><p>election or maybe going for impeachment.  Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, a key minister and close adviser to the prime </p><p>minister, told us that he tentatively favored the idea </p><p>of calling a new election.  In his estimation, given the </p><p>popularity of the peace process, the UNP could count on </p><p>picking up a good number of seats if an election is held </p><p>soon.  Simultaneously, the PA could expect to lose quite </p><p>a few seats, while the UNP\'s ally, the TNA, picked up </p><p>seats.  He elaborated on two crucial problems with this </p><p>option.  First, most UNP MPs were not very enthusiastic </p><p>about entering into what could be an unpredictable </p><p>election process.  Second, it was not clear </p><p>constitutionally whether the PM and the governing </p><p>coalition could call election on their own volition or </p><p>whether they needed the approval of the president. </p><p>(Note:  Although there is plenty of ambiguity, a reading </p><p>of the constitution tends to indicate that only the </p><p>president has the power to call an election and </p><p>Kumaratunga has indicated that she has no plans to do so </p><p>-- See more on this issue below in para seven.)  (Note: </p><p>Ref A FBIS report indicates that the cabinet has </p><p>formally decided to go for a new election.  Best that we </p><p>can figure, the report is not accurate.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Inpeaching the President?:  Another option </p><p>involves the impeachment route.  Moragoda noted that </p><p>there are a number of UNP MPs who want to move forward </p><p>with a long-standing plan to impeach Kumaratunga on </p><p>abuse of power and other charges.  The supporters of </p><p>this course are vocal and influential in the UNP. </p><p>Moragoda remarked, however, that they do not have the </p><p>ear of the PM, who is reluctant to go down this track </p><p>because it would lead to distractions that would </p><p>probably get in the way of GSL initiatives, including </p><p>the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>Presidential Assistant\'s Reaction </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The president\'s office clearly is not unhappy </p><p>over the government\'s conundrum on what to do.  In a </p><p>meeting with PAO and polchief, Harim Peiris, a </p><p>presidential media adviser, appeared quite satisfied </p><p>regarding what he had heard about the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>apparent decision.  He remarked that the court was only </p><p>taking the position that the president\'s office had held </p><p>since the proposal was first made.  Asked about possible </p><p>next steps by the government, Peiris speculated that it </p><p>probably would not go for impeachment, which was too </p><p>messy.  As for a new election, Peiris was clear that he </p><p>thought that only the president had the ultimate power </p><p>to make that decision and she had publicly stated that </p><p>she had no intention of doing so.  It was also possible, </p><p>Peiris allowed, that the government might rewrite its </p><p>proposed amendment, framing it to pass the court\'s </p><p>muster.  All in all, Peiris thought that cohabitation </p><p>would muddle along, with no great shifts.  He stressed </p><p>that the cohabitation situation would be greatly </p><p>improved if Prime Minister Wickremesinghe would order </p><p>all members of his cabinet to quit what Peiris termed </p><p>"harsh attacks" on the president, who only wanted to be </p><p>"treated like a lady." </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The smoke has not yet cleared on this situation. </p><p>Indeed, although there clearly has been a leak, the </p><p>Supreme Court\'s decision has not yet been formally </p><p>announced and it is possible that initial reports on its </p><p>contents may be inaccurate.  All that said, it does seem </p><p>that the government has suffered a setback in its </p><p>efforts to marginalize the president.  President </p><p>Kumaratunga has played a weak hand very well and seems </p><p>to have put the government on the defensive for the </p><p>moment.  It is possible that this will unnerve the GSL </p><p>and make it press harder against her, perhaps by </p><p>precipitating a potential constitutional crisis over who </p><p>has the power to call a new election.  At the same time, </p><p>it is possible that the government may take the opposite </p><p>tack and decide to try harder to work with her.  In </p><p>fact, the GSL may be leaning in this direction already </p><p>per its recent decision to engage the president in </p><p>"joint" meetings on peace process and national security </p><p>issues (see Reftels).  If the government chooses this </p><p>latter option and does not to hit the panic button, the </p><p>present convoluted situation might lead to improved </p><p>cohabitation ties, not worse.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
