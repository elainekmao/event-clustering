<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001571 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EMIN, PINS, BM, Economy, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: KACHIN ETHNIC BUSINESSES: JADE, GOLD, AND LIQUOR </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Ethnic Kachin cease-fire groups have </p><p>benefited significantly from semi-autonomous economic control </p><p>of their areas of influence.  The commercial arms of these </p><p>armies turned political groups are involved in everything </p><p>from jade and gold mining to sugar milling and liquor </p><p>production.  Unfortunately, to date little of this economic </p><p>windfall has trickled down to the poor residents of the </p><p>cease-fire groups\' remote areas of control.  However, with </p><p>some political changes afoot, this imbalance may start to </p><p>change.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Two Embassy staff recently visited Myitkyina, the </p><p>capital of Kachin State.  Kachin State is located in the far </p><p>north of Burma, bordered on the east by China and on the </p><p>northwest by India.  For more than 40 years, the state was </p><p>caught up in the turmoil of civil war, with a cease-fire </p><p>agreement between the government and the predominate Kachin </p><p>Independence Army (KIA) signed only in 1994.  On the economic </p><p>side, Kachin State is mountainous and very rich in natural </p><p>resources, containing the world\'s only pure jadeite mines as </p><p>well as gold, timber, and other mining.  Despite these </p><p>riches, the people remain very poor and the economy quite </p><p>undeveloped.  The riches gained from the jade and gold mines </p><p>do not trickle down very far, and according to one Kachin </p><p>leader in Rangoon, the SPDC has put little or no development </p><p>funding into the state since 1994 (though it has granted NGOs </p><p>access to the area).  Increasing Chinese economic influence </p><p>in the state has further intensified local people\'s concerns </p><p>that their state\'s wealth is being exported. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Since the cease-fire, the armed groups have begun to </p><p>focus on political and economic matters within their zones of </p><p>control.  The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO; the </p><p>political wing of the KIA), and, to a lesser extent, the New </p><p>Democratic Army - Kachin State (NDA-K), both have corporate </p><p>arms which occupy themselves primarily with earning revenue </p><p>from natural resource extraction and some customs collection. </p><p> The KIO, through its commercial arm, Bu Ga Co., Ltd, has the </p><p>widest economic interests including a sugar mill and a rum </p><p>distillery. </p><p> </p><p>A Smorgasbord of Natural Resources... </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Bu Ga, and other Kachin business leaders, </p><p>under the terms of the 1994 cease-fire agreement, the KIO and </p><p>NDA-K have some autonomy in the development of the natural </p><p>resources within their "territories."  If the SPDC wants to </p><p>offer for bid areas for timbering or mining within the KIO </p><p>zone, there has to be an agreement struck between the SPDC, </p><p>the KIO, and the investor.  The details are unclear of how </p><p>these agreements are structured.  The lack of such an </p><p>agreement can lead to violence.  We heard one tale of a KIA </p><p>attack several years ago on a Chinese firm that signed an </p><p>agreement with the SPDC to mine coal in a KIA-controlled area </p><p>without consultation with the Kachin group. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) For plots not put up for bid by the SPDC, the KIO </p><p>says it is free to negotiate directly with private firms. </p><p>Non-KIO Kachin jade miners and businessmen told us that </p><p>dealing with the KIO is often easier than negotiating with </p><p>the SPDC because the smaller bureaucracy means fewer bribes. </p><p>The sections of the Irrawaddy River that run through KIO </p><p>territory can be dredged for gold without government </p><p>approval.  For portions of the river within SPDC-controlled </p><p>territory, mining is only possible in a joint venture with </p><p>the corporate front of the Burmese army\'s powerful Northern </p><p>Command. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) However, according to Kachin sources, neither the </p><p>local Kachin-owned jade mining firms, nor Bu Ga, have the </p><p>capital to invest in the heavy machinery needed for serious </p><p>mining.  For that equipment, local firms grudgingly link up </p><p>with the military\'s Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd, </p><p>with overseas Chinese who are prevented by Burmese law from </p><p>directly investing in jade mining, or with companies tied to </p><p>Wa, Kokang, and Pa-O ethnic cease-fire groups in Shan State. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) There are conflicting tales on logging.  In theory, </p><p>the KIO political leadership asserts, there is a KIO ban on </p><p>logging in its cease-fire zone.  Only under very special </p><p>circumstances, and with the agreement of the government, can </p><p>some logging be undertaken.  An example of such an exception </p><p>is some teak logging that was permitted by the KIO and SPDC </p><p>in order to clear land for expansion of the Myitkyina-Bhamo </p><p>road.  In reality, Bu Ga is still involved in the logging </p><p>industry, both buying whole logs from the government for </p><p>processing and export, and cutting trees illegally for sale </p><p>over the Chinese border.  Bu Ga told us the logging in the </p><p>KIO regions is constrained more by the depletion of good </p><p>trees than by political mandates. </p><p> </p><p>...And A Few Non-Traditional Ventures </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Through a quirk of the cease-fire accord, the KIA </p><p>(through Bu Ga) was forced by the SPDC to take over a </p><p>decrepit and money-losing sugar mill near Myitkyina.  The </p><p>mill, circa 1956, suffers from a lack of raw materials (most </p><p>local farmers would rather pan for gold than grow sugar </p><p>cane), chronic spare part shortages (due to government import </p><p>controls), and poor quality control.  One way Bu Ga is trying </p><p>to make up for these shortcomings is by turning the sugar </p><p>cane into rum for sale locally. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Another good source of income for the KIA is customs </p><p>revenue.  The KIA, which controls most of the Burma-China </p><p>border in Kachin State, maintains good relations with local </p><p>Chinese frontier officials.  The KIO seems to have the </p><p>primary right to collect customs on trade that comes through </p><p>the controlled border areas. </p><p> </p><p>Regional Development Misses the Gravy Train </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) It is difficult to get a clear picture of whether </p><p>the KIA\'s economic benefits are being transmitted in a </p><p>meaningful way to the grassroots level.  We did not travel to </p><p>the KIA zone, but NGOs in Myitkyina told us that the areas </p><p>around the Chinese border are the poorest and least developed </p><p>in the State.  Likewise, KIO leaders were not able to point </p><p>to any concerted effort to turn a portion of the revenue </p><p>earned by the KIA and its commercial arm into community and </p><p>economic development.  The one exception is the Kachin </p><p>Baptist Convention, a group closely affiliated with the KIO, </p><p>which has been working independently and with other community </p><p>and religious groups on health education and community </p><p>development projects in some remote villages. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment:  Despite significant economic benefits that </p><p>have come the way of the cease-fire groups and their </p><p>affiliated businesses, until now, regional economic </p><p>development has not been a priority of the Kachin ethnic </p><p>leadership.  However, there is some optimism that this may </p><p>change.  The KIO is under new, younger leadership (as of </p><p>January 2002), which has dedicated itself to more "openness" </p><p>and a better "connection with the masses."  KIO leaders also </p><p>told us they would like to attract more tourism and foreign </p><p>investment in infrastructure in its area.  Likewise, the KIO, </p><p>the NDA-K, and the smaller Kachin Democratic Army (operating </p><p>in northern Shan State) have apparently unified politically </p><p>under the Kachin National Consultative Assembly (KNCA).  The </p><p>KNCA is asserting that two of its primary goals are economic </p><p>development and improved education for all Kachin people. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
