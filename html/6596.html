<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, CASC, KFLO, MARR, PREL, PINR, AMGT, IZ, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: NIGERIA QUIET IN WAKE OF IRAQ ATTACK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B&D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  News of the initial attack by the </p><p>Coalition of the Willing (COW) on Iraq spread rapidly. </p><p>Most Nigerians are aware hostilities have begun, but the </p><p>initial public reaction was muted.  The mood now is tense </p><p>and expectant.  Public response to the hostilities will </p><p>likely be delayed until tomorrow, March 21, after Friday </p><p>prayers and after potential demonstrators had an extra day </p><p>to organize.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>THE MOOD </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Throughout the nation, Embassy contacts report no </p><p>demonstrations or violence.  While Nigeria remains calm on </p><p>the surface, privately, many (especially religious leaders) </p><p>express resentment and opposition to the war.  Christian </p><p>and Muslim clerics alike have called on their followers to </p><p>pray.  While the Christian protesters have no convenient </p><p>timetable, the Muslims will listen attentively to Juma\'at </p><p>Prayers March 21 to hear what the Imams have to say.  Large </p><p>crowds associated with the Friday gatherings provide a </p><p>convenient recruitment base for demonstrations, while the </p><p>Mosques themselves offer excellent venues for launching </p><p>points. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>REPORTS OF DEMONSTRATIONS UNCONFIRMED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Reports of an anti-American rally in Kano March </p><p>19 and one in Abuja March 20 appear to be baseless.  In </p><p>Kano, dozens of Hizba (religious police) members </p><p>demonstrated at the Kano State Government offices, </p><p>insisting that their role in implementing Shari\'a in Kano </p><p>should be officially endorsed.  Kano State officials </p><p>assured the Embassy they were taking the threat of violence </p><p>seriously and working to minimize the chance of any </p><p>protests taking a violent turn. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In Abuja, Ambassador and PolCouns transited an </p><p>area where a 3,000 person demonstration was reportedly </p><p>taking place.  They saw nothing that would indicate a </p><p>protest.  A demonstration thought to be about one-third </p><p>that size did take place in the Central Area, but it </p><p>targeted the GON\'s failure to attack corruption.  The </p><p>demonstrators evidenced no interest in Iraq, according to </p><p>Mission surveillance detection assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  It is still early in the COW campaign, </p><p>and potential protesters have not yet had time to coalesce. </p><p>Friday, March 21, will give a first indication of what we </p><p>can expect in Nigeria in response to the attack on Iraq. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
