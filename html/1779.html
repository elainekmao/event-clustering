<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ETHNIC CLASHES IN NASARAWA STATE: </p><p>CONFLICT OVER LAND AND COMMUNITY STATUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  Ethnic clashes in the Middle-Belt State of </p><p>Nasarawa highlight long-standing and bitter disputes over </p><p>land and community status.  "Settlers" and indigenes trade </p><p>reprisal raids, burning homes, seizing property, and taking </p><p>lives.  The State Government struggles to effect dialogue </p><p>between the affected communities,  and relative peace appears </p><p>to have been re-established after security forces intervened. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Local press reported June 22 violent clashes between </p><p>rival ethnic groups in the south-east corner of Nasarawa </p><p>State, a Middle-Belt State located immediately to the east of </p><p>the Federal Capital Territory.  One report listed 10 killed </p><p>in clashes near the town of Azara over the past few days </p><p>between ethnic Tiv communities and Hausa-speaking </p><p>inhabitants.  Poloff spoke by telephone with Nasarawa Deputy </p><p>Governor Onje Gye-Wado June 22, and received an update on the </p><p>conflict and the State Government\'s efforts to calm the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Gye-Wado told Poloff that, in an area long unsettled </p><p>by tensions between rival ethnic groups in the south-eastern </p><p>corner of the state, the latest round of attacks and </p><p>reprisals began in March with the murder of a Kwala community </p><p>leader.  Gye-Wado spoke of a four-way contest between the </p><p>Tiv, the Kwala, Hausa-speaking peoples originally from Borno </p><p>State (located to the north), and Jukun communities.  The </p><p>Deputy Governor had no exact figures at hand, but he said </p><p>that "quite a few" people had lost their lives over the last </p><p>three months in repeated raids by the four groups on each </p><p>other\'s communities, the burning of homes, and looting of </p><p>property.  The root causes of the conflict were access to </p><p>land, and the relative status of the various communities </p><p>vis-a-vis the others.  "It is a very tricky situation," said </p><p>Gye-Wado.  "Everyone is always talking of "settlers," and how </p><p>they must leave the area."  Each ethnic group (aside from the </p><p>Hausa-speakers) made some claim to being indigenes, with the </p><p>others categorized as interlopers (and hence of low status). </p><p>Many people had fled the area in the past two weeks, he said, </p><p>in particular Tiv peoples crossing into Benue State to the </p><p>south (which is a majority Tiv state). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Gye-Dado said that violence sprang up again last week </p><p>after the murder of a community leader among the </p><p>Hausa-speakers.  In one unfortunate incident this week, he </p><p>said, six rioters were killed by police, with one policeman </p><p>killed in the melee. Beefed-up security forces had basically </p><p>restored order, he said, but beyond the immediate </p><p>intervention of security forces, his government had spent </p><p>much time and effort on consultative measures with and among </p><p>the four communities.  The Nasarawa Government had also </p><p>worked intensively with the Benue Government to discuss </p><p>lessening of tensions and joint security meansures, he said. </p><p>These efforts had borne fruit, and, for now, at least, a </p><p>relative calm had returned to the area.  People had begun to </p><p>return to their homes.  Although he offered no predictions, </p><p>the Deputy Governor said he hoped that dialogue and </p><p>consultation would prevail, and the rounds of reprisal </p><p>attacks cease. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment.  Bitter disputes over land and community </p><p>status bedevil many States in Nigeria.  Tiv, Jukun, Kwala and </p><p>Hausa-speakers live intermingled in this section of Nasarawa </p><p>State and disputes tend to fester for months if not years. </p><p>The Nawarawa Government appears to understand the importance </p><p>of dialogue and consultation.  But localized disputes such as </p><p>this will continue among impoverished communities where land </p><p>and status are acutely coveted and jealously guarded.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
