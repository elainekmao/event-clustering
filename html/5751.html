<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MOPS, IZ, CA, Iraq, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ/UN: CANADIAN REACTION TO FEBRUARY 14 </p><p>INSPECTORS\' REPORT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 15. (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham, speaking to </p><p>the press after the February 14 weapons inspectors\' report to </p><p>the UN Security Council, said that the report shows progress </p><p>as well as the need for continued pressure on Iraq.  Graham </p><p>said that while no-one is excluding the use of force, that is </p><p>the last resort, and there is still a chance war can be </p><p>avoided.  Echoing Prime Minister Chretien\'s February 13 </p><p>speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Graham </p><p>emphasized the importance of staying faithful to the UN </p><p>process and Resolution 1441.  He argued that no country, </p><p>including the United States, intended to move immediately </p><p>against Iraq.  When pressed on whether Canada would </p><p>participate in a military campagin against Iraq that did not </p><p>have UN blessing, Graham refused to speculate. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Early reaction in the Canadian media was that the </p><p>inspectors\' report supports the French argument for continued </p><p>inspections.  Commentators noted that Blix and El-Baradei </p><p>felt there was still useful work to be done, and that they </p><p>are still building their capacity. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: While the GoC continues to keep its options </p><p>open, the inspectors\' report does not help our case here in </p><p>the court of public opinion.  Chretien\'s Liberal Party is </p><p>split over Iraq, with four backbench MPs voting for a </p><p>February 11 opposition resolution  requiring explicit UNSC </p><p>endorsement for action if Canadian were to participate.  So </p><p>long as the inspectors say they are making progress and the </p><p>Security Council is not ready to abandon that process, the </p><p>GoC will find it hard to disagree. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT CONT\'D: Graham did tell the press that time is </p><p>"very limited" for Iraq, but the GoC would clearly prefer </p><p>some accommodation between the U.S. and France in the </p><p>Security Council.  In that vein, we note that Graham also </p><p>mentioned he would be discussing Iraq later on February 14 </p><p>with the Mexican Foreign Minister.  As for the NATO dispute </p><p>over support to Turkey, Foreign Affairs contacts tell us that </p><p>Graham and Political Director Jim Wright took the French </p><p>Ambassador to task this week over France\'s continued </p><p>obstruction. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
