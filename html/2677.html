END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE IDLI ASSEMBLY OF MEMBER STATES MET MARCH 20, 2002 </p><p>IN ROME. IDLI MEMBERS ARE: U.S., TUNISIA, SENEGAL, </p><p>NORWAY, FRANCE, CHINA, BULGARIA, AUSTRALIA, COLOMBIA, </p><p>ECUADOR, EGYPT, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PHILIPPINES, ITALY </p><p>AUSTRIA AND SUDAN.  USAID LEGAL COUNSEL JOHN GARDNER AND </p><p>MISOFF COMPRISED THE U.S. DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. IDLI\'S ANNUAL REPORT, PREPARED BY DIRECTOR WILLIAM </p><p>LORIS (U.S.) NOTED THAT THE ORGANIZATION\'S STRATEGIC </p><p>PLAN, ENTITLED "VISION 2000," ENVISIONED IDLI GROWING IN </p><p>STATURE AS AN ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE </p><p>RECOGNITION INTERNATIONALLY AS A LEADER IN PROMOTING THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AS A MEANS OF DEVELOPMENT (SEE DISCUSSION </p><p>REFTEL B).  LORIS HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR THE WORK THAT </p><p>IDLI HAD DONE TRAINING JUDGES IN EAST TIMOR, ITS PROPOSED </p><p>PROJECT ON RESTORATION OF RULE OF LAW IN AFGHANISTAN, AND </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS ALUMNI NETWORKS (SOME 29 LOCAL </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS OF IDLI-TRAINED LEGAL PROFESSIONALS FROM </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION). THE </p><p>RECENT DECISION OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO MAKE AN </p><p>ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF USD 200,000 TO IDLI WAS WELCOMED, </p><p>ALONG WITH HOPES THAT OTHER DONORS MIGHT CONSIDER MAKING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01544  01 OF 02  270916Z </p><p>ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN LINE WITH "VISION 2000," MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO </p><p>APPROVE TWO CHANGES TO IDLI\'S "ESTABLISHMENT AGREEMENT": </p><p>1) CHANGE THE NAME TO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LAW </p><p>ORGANIZATION (VICE INSTITUTE) IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE </p><p>COMMON MISPERCEPTION THAT IDLI IS CONNECTED TO AN </p><p>ACADEMIC INSTITUTE AND 2) PROVIDE A SPECIFIC MANDATE FOR </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE (REFTEL A). </p><p> </p><p>5.  CHINA AND FRANCE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE NOT IN A </p><p>POSITION TO SUPPORT THE CHANGES. CHINA STATED THAT HER </p><p>COUNTRY DID NOT WISH TO SEE IDLI CHANGE FROM A TRAINING </p><p>INSTITUTE TO A POLICY INSTITUTE AND THEREFORE WAS NOT IN </p><p>A POSITION TO ADOPT CHANGES TO THE BASIC TEXTS (COMMENT: </p><p>THE CHINESE POSITION MAY REFLECT THE FACT THAT </p><p>"GOVERNANCE" AND "RULE OF LAW"  -- WHILE ALWAYS IMPLICIT </p><p>IN IDLI\'S MANDATE -- WERE HERETOFORE NOT SO EMPHASIZED. </p><p>END COMMENT). FRANCE DID NOT EXPLAIN HER POSITION TO THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY, BUT TOLD USDEL ON THE MARGINS THAT FRANCE WAS </p><p>OPPOSED TO CHANGING IDLI\'S NAME TO "ORGANIZATION" </p><p>BECAUSE, WITH ONLY 16 MEMBERS, IT WAS PREMATURE FOR THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION TO ASPIRE TO UN SPECIALIZED AGENCY STATUS </p><p>(REFERRING TO THE DIRECTOR\'S OPENING REMARKS WHERE HE </p><p>SAID THAT HE HOPED THAT ONE DAY IDLI WOULD BE TO "RULE OF </p><p>LAW" WHAT WHO WAS TO HEALTH).  FURTHERMORE, FRANCE DID </p><p>NOT SUPPORT THE ORGANIZATION MOVING AWAY FROM A VOLUNTARY </p><p>TO ASSESSED BUDGET BASIS AND WAS CONCERNED THAT, AS AN </p><p>"ORGANIZATION," IDLI MIGHT NEXT PROPOSE A NEW FUNDING </p><p>BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01544  01 OF 02  270916Z </p><p>6.  U.S., NETHERLANDS, AUSTRALIA AND ITALY EXPRESSED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES.  OTHER DELEGATES STATED </p><p>THAT THEY WERE WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, OR NOT AUTHORIZED TO </p><p>VOTE.  IT WAS AGREED THAT THE VOTE WOULD BE CONDUCTED BY </p><p>CORRESPONDENCE AND A RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED TO THAT </p><p>EFFECT. (COMMENT: A THREE QUARTERS MAJORITY IS NEEDED TO </p><p>CHANGE THE BASIC TEXTS.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE MEMBERS APPROVED WITHOUT DEBATE THE DATE OF THE </p><p>NEXT SESSION (MARCH 2005), A RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL OFFICE IN CAIRO, </p><p>APPROVAL OF A NEW STEERING COMMITTEE (AUSTRIA, CHINA AND </p><p>EGYPT) AND THE APPOINTMENT OF THREE NEW DIRECTORS: </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICE CATHERINE BRANSON (AUSTRALIA), FEDERAL COURT OF </p><p>AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY </p><p>MRS.
