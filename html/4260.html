(C) HOLY SEE DIRECTOR OF CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS PAINTED A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05471  01 OF 02  080949Z </p><p>PICTURE OF A DEFENSIVE CUBAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN A NOVEMBER 6 </p><p>MEETING WITH POLOFFS TO DISCUSS CUBA AND VENEZUELA (VENEZUELA </p><p>REPORTED SEPTEL).  MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA SAID THE HOLY SEE AND </p><p>CUBAN CHURCH HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ENGAGE IN OVERTLY POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATIC DISSIDENTS IN CUBA IN ORDER TO AVOID A </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON THE CHURCH BY THE GOC.  HE NOTED THAT THE ONE </p><p>CHURCH-RELATED PUBLICATION THAT ENGAGES IN POLITICAL </p><p>COMMENTARY, "VITRAL," HAS CAUSED THE HOLY SEE SOME DIFFICULTY </p><p>WITH CUBAN AUTHORITIES, ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE BISHOP RESPONSIBLE FOR IT TO RESPOND </p><p>POSITIVELY TO CUBAN AUTHORITIES\' DEMAND THAT IT BE REGISTERED </p><p>DESPITE THE BISHOP\'S FEARS OF CENSORSHIP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>A CHURCH PLAYING DEFENSE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON RECENT USINT REPORTING ON CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH ACTIVITIES IN CUBA (REFTELS), POLOFFS CALLED ON </p><p>VATICAN COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE CARIBBEAN STATES, MSGR. </p><p>GIORGIO LINGUA, NOVEMBER 6 TO DISCUSS THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS OF </p><p>THE STATE OF THE CHURCH AND DEMOCRATIC DISSIDENCE IN CUBA. </p><p>WE ASKED WHETHER THE PAPAL NUNCIO HAS DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINS </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE DISSIDENT COMMUNITY AND WHETHER THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WOULD TAKE A POSITION ON A CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION. </p><p> LINGUA RESPONDED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY INTENTION OF </p><p>THE HOLY SEE TO ENGAGE ON THE HR RESOLUTION, EVEN BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES.  FURTHERMORE, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE SUPPORTS THE CUBAN </p><p>CHURCH\'S CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO POLITICAL ACTIVITIES, AND WAS </p><p>NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANNED OUTREACH TO CUBA\'S DISSIDENT </p><p>COMMUNITY BY THE NUNCIO.  HE INDICATED THAT THE CHURCH (AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05471  01 OF 02  080949Z </p><p>THE HOLY SEE) PHILOSOPHICALLY SUPPORTED GREATER POLITICAL </p><p>FREEDOMS IN CUBA.  HOWEVER, HE PAINTED A PICTURE OF A CHURCH </p><p>IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DEFENSIVE POSTURE. ITS OVERRIDING CONCERN </p><p>WAS TO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY OF THE FAITHFUL TO PRACTICE THEIR </p><p>FAITH AND TO AVOID A CRACKDOWN BY THE GOC ON THE CHURCH\'S OWN </p><p>LIMITED FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS CAUTION, LINGUA POINTED TO THE </p><p>FACT THAT ALMOST ALL CHURCH PUBLICATIONS IN CUBA AVOID </p><p>EXPLICITLY POLITICAL COMMENTARY.  HE SAID THE ONLY EXCEPTION </p><p>IS THE PUBLICATION OF THE PINAR DEL RIO DIOCESE\'S NEWSLETTER </p><p>"VITRAL," WHOSE EDITOR, DAGOBERTO VALDEZ, WAS A RELATIVELY </p><p>OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE GOC.  LINGUA TOLD US THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE HAD RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT VITRAL FROM THE </p><p>CUBAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE.  IN RESPONSE, THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>ALWAYS UNDERSCORED THE PAPER\'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD </p><p>URGED THE BISHOP OF PINAR DEL RIO TO "REGISTER" THE PAPER </p><p>WITH CUBAN AUTHORITIES AS THE LATTER HAVE BEEN DEMANDING. </p><p>THE HOLY SEE THOUGHT IT NORMAL FOR REVENUE GENERATING </p><p>ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VITRAL TO HAVE TO REGISTER WITH CIVIL </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  BUT, ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE BISHOP FEARED </p><p>CENSORSHIP AND HAD SO FAR REFUSED TO REGISTER THE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  QUERIED AS TO WHY THE CHURCH IN CUBA, AN </p><p>HISTORICALLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY, WASN\'T AS ACTIVE IN THE FIGHT </p><p>FOR FREEDOM AS HAD BEEN THE POLISH CHURCH, LINGUA NOTED THAT </p><p>THE CHURCH HAD ALWAYS CHARTED A CAUTIOUS COURSE IN CUBA, YET </p><p>IT WAS NEVER SUPPRESSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS HAD BEEN THE </p><p>CASE IN MANY COUNTRIES OF EASTERN EUROPE.  CATHOLIC CLERGY, </p><p>EVEN BISHOPS, WERE ALL CUBANS, NOT FOREIGN, AND HAD RETAINED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05471  01 OF 02  080949Z </p><p>THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE AND PROMOTE THEIR FAITH.  THEY HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN THROWN INTO A GULAG, AS HAD BEEN THE CASE IN EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE, AND THUS DID NOT FEEL AS THREATENED BY "OLD FASHIONED </p><p>SOCIALISM" AS THEIR EASTERN EUROPEAN BRETHREN. NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>LINGUA RECOGNIZED THAT THE CHURCH WAS CONSTRAINED, AS IT </p><p>NEITHER HOSTED POLITICAL EVENTS NOR PROVIDED RESOURCES FOR </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS PROVIDING MEETING SPACES) IN </p><p>ORDER TO AVOID PROVOKING THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SEEKING SPACE AMIDST CONSTRAINTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN REVIEWING CURRENT RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE </p><p>CHURCH, LINGUA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CHURCH\'S SOCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE) HAD BEEN </p><p>TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE AFTER THE REVOLUTION, AND THAT MANY </p><p>CHURCH PROPERTIES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED.  IN ADDITION, HE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9473 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05471  02 OF 02  080950Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------0560F0  080950Z /38 </p><p>P 080839Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>USINT HAVANA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005471 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, CU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE CAUTIOUS ON CUBAN DISSIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>NOTED THAT THE GOC CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE VISA APPLICATIONS </p><p>AND ACTIVITIES IN CUBA OF NON-CUBAN RELIGIOUS WORKERS -- </p><p>PARTICULARLY THOSE ENGAGED IN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD DISCUSSED ANY CONCERNS WITH THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE LOMBARDY REGIONAL GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>AGREEMENT TO REFURBISH A FORMER CHURCH PROPERTY (REF D), </p><p>LINGUA APPEARED UNAWARE OF THE DECISION AND WAS NON-COMMITTAL. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NO PLANS FOR TRANSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05471  02 OF 02  080950Z </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  POLOFFS PRESSED LINGUA WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD </p><p>GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO PREPARING FOR AN EVENTUAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>TRANSITION IN CUBA, AND HE OFFERED HIS VIEW THAT SUCH A </p><p>TRANSITION, WHILE INEVITABLE, COULD BE MANY YEARS AWAY, EVEN </p><p>YEARS AFTER FIDEL CASTRO LEAVES THE SCENE.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>MANY OF HIS CUBAN INTERLOCUTORS WERE REVOLUTIONARY "TRUE </p><p>BELIEVERS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ENDING EMBARGO WOULD STIMULATE REFORM </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) TURNING TO THE EMBARGO, LINGUA MAINTAINED THAT EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE EMBARGO WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CUBA\'S DIRE </p><p>ECONOMIC STRAITS, WERE IT TO BE LIFTED THE GOC WOULD HAVE NO </p><p>MORE EXCUSES FOR ITS POOR PERFORMANCE; ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>REFORMS WOULD NECESSARILY FOLLOW.  REFLECTING VIEWS WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD AT CARITAS, LINGUA BELIEVED PHASING OUT THE EMBARGO </p><p>WOULD BE "JUST" AS WELL AS "SMART," AS A REFORM PROCESS WOULD </p><p>HELP AVOID A SUDDEN POLARIZATION OF CUBAN SOCIETY THAT COULD </p><p>LEAD TO VIOLENCE DURING A POST-CASTRO TRANSITION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE\'S CONTINUED CAUTION ON ITS APPROACH TO </p><p>CUBA AND ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER PLANNING FOR A </p><p>POST-REVOLUTIONARY CUBA ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05471  02 OF 02  080950Z </p><p>TRADITIONALLY CAUTIOUS VATICAN DIPLOMATIC CORPS.    IT ALSO </p><p>REFLECTS A GROWING RESIGNATION THAT THE POPE\'S HISTORIC 1998 </p><p>HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA HAS CHANGED LITTLE.  IN THE PAST WE </p><p>HAVE HEARD DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THE VATICAN AT LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS IN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AFTER THE POPE\'S HISTORIC 1998 </p><p>VISIT TO CUBA, WHEREAS NOW, THEY APPEAR WILLING TO TAKE </p><p>HALF-A-LOAF AND WAIT FOR POLITICAL CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE </p><p>BEFORE PRESSING HARD FOR GREATER FREEDOMS.  AS A RESULT, WE </p><p>EXPECT THE HOLY SEE (IF NOT ALL OF ITS BISHOPS) WILL REMAIN </p><p>DISCRETE IN DEALINGS WITH CUBA\'S DISSIDENT COMMUNITY, WHILE </p><p>PATIENTLY SEEKING TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND SPACE FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>ENGAGE MORE DIRECTLY WITH DISSIDENTS AND RAISE ITS VOICE AS </p><p>THE POPE DID IN 1998 FOR BROADER HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05471 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
