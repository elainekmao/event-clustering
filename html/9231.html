<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001277 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, PRM/RMACKLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, PHUM, KIRF, CH, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: GON CANCELS DALAI LAMA CELEBRATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 KATHMANDU 1332 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  ON JULY 4, THE GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL </p><p>(GON) PROHIBITED TIBETAN GROUPS FROM HOLDING CELEBRATIONS </p><p>ON JULY 6 TO HONOR THE DALAI LAMA\'S BIRTHDAY.  DESPITE THE </p><p>PROHIBITION, AT LEAST TWO TIBETAN GROUPS PROCEEDED WITH </p><p>CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT GON INTERFERENCE.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS ARE NECESSARILY POLITICAL AS WELL AS </p><p>RELIGIOUS, THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO SIGNAL A FURTHER </p><p>TIGHTENING OF RESTRICTIONS ON TIBETAN ACTIVITIES IN NEPAL. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JUNE 19, THE OFFICE OF TIBET FORMALLY APPLIED </p><p>FOR PERMISSION TO HOLD BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS, INCLUDING A </p><p>CULTURAL SHOW AT A TIBETAN BOARDING SCHOOL AND AN EVENING </p><p>RECEPTION FOR DIGNITARIES AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS AT A MAJOR </p><p>HOTEL.  ON JUNE 26, WANGCHUK TSERING, THE DALAI LAMA\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN NEPAL, RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM </p><p>KATHMANDU\'S CHIEF DISTRICT OFFICER (CDO) TO HOLD THE </p><p>CELEBRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) HOWEVER, ON JULY 4, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE </p><p>FOR CENTRAL KATHMANDU TOLD TSERING THAT, ON THE ORDER OF </p><p>THE HOME MINISTRY, THE OFFICE OF TIBET WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>CANCEL ALL CELEBRATIONS HELD IN HONOR OF THE DALAI LAMA\'S </p><p>BIRTHDAY, EVEN THOSE TO BE HELD INSIDE THE TEMPLE AT </p><p>BOUDDHANATH STUPA AND SURROUNDING MONASTERIES.  [NOTE. </p><p>THE BOUDDHANATH STUPA IS CONSIDERED THE HOLIEST TEMPLE FOR </p><p>TIBETAN BUDDHISTS IN NEPAL.  END NOTE.]  ACCORDING TO </p><p>TSERING, THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID THAT CELEBRATIONS COULD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ONLY BE HELD "IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN HOMES."  DESPITE </p><p>REPEATED EFFORTS TO CONTACT OTHER GON OFFICIALS, THE </p><p>OFFICE OF TIBET AND OTHER TIBETAN COMMUNITY LEADERS MADE </p><p>REPEATED BUT UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO PERSUADE GON </p><p>OFFICIALS TO GRANT THEM PERMISSION TO HOLD THE </p><p>CELEBRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) DESPITE THE PROHIBITION, AT LEAST TWO TIBETAN </p><p>GROUPS HELD CELEBRATIONS ON JULY 6.  A GROUP OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 300 BUDDHIST NEPALI CITIZENS GATHERED AT THE </p><p>BOUDDHANATH STUPA TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTHDAY.  ALSO, THE </p><p>HIMALAYAN BUDDHIST SOCIETY PROCEEDED WITH ITS CELEBRATION </p><p>AT A MONASTERY NEAR BOUDDHA, NORTHEAST OF KATHMANDU, WHICH </p><p>BETWEEN 300-400 PEOPLE ATTENDED.   THESE CELEBRATIONS WERE </p><p>CONDUCTED WITHOUT INTERFERENCE BY THE GON. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT.  WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE CANCELLATION OF </p><p>TIBETAN CELEBRATIONS FOR THE DALAI LAMA\'S BIRTHDAY AGAIN </p><p>THIS YEAR REPRESENTS A FURTHER TIGHTENING OF TIBETAN </p><p>CULTURAL EXPRESSION IN NEPAL.  THIS YEAR, UNLIKE LAST </p><p>YEAR, THE OFFICE OF TIBET FORMALLY REQUESTED, AND </p><p>RECEIVED, PERMISSION FROM THE GON TO HOLD ITS </p><p>CELEBRATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT WAS LATER RESCINDED.  ALSO </p><p>UNLIKE LAST YEAR, THE TIBETANS WERE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>PROHIBITED FROM HOLDING CEREMONIES WITHIN TEMPLES AND </p><p>MONASTERIES.  THE DALAI LAMA\'S DUAL ROLE NOT ONLY AS </p><p>RELIGIOUS FIGURE BUT ALSO AS HEAD OF THE TIBETAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN EXILE POSES A SERIOUS DILEMMA FOR THE GON. </p><p>OFFICIALS AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TELL US THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE NO DESIRE TO CURTAIL TIBETAN RELIGIOUS </p><p>PRACTICES, BUT THE TIBETAN THEOCRACY IN EXILE MEANS THAT </p><p>VIRTUALLY EVERY EVENT ORGANIZED BY THE DALAI LAMA\'S OFFICE </p><p>IN NEPAL IS INVESTED WITH NATIONALISTIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE, WHICH COMPLICATES NEPAL\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>CHINA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
