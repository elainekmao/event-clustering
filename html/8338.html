SUMMARY:  USAID/OFDA ASIA REGIONAL ADVISOR TRAVELED TO </p><p>SRI LANKA FROM MAY 21-25 TO ASSIST THE MISSION WITH </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE FLOOD DISASTER.  SHE TRAVELED WITH </p><p>USAID/SRI LANKA MISSION DISASTER RELIEF OFFICER (MDRO) TO </p><p>THE WORST HIT DISTRICTS IN SOUTHWESTERN SRI LANKA.  WHILE </p><p>THE FLOODWATERS HAVE RECEDED IN MANY OF THE AREAS AT </p><p>HIGHER ELEVATIONS, WATER LEVELS REMAIN HIGH OR HAVE RISEN </p><p>IN SOME OF THE LOW LYING AREAS. AS ROAD ACCESS TO MOST </p><p>AREAS IMPROVES, FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF ITEMS ARE BEING </p><p>DISTRIBUTED TO AFFECTED FAMILIES. CROP DAMAGE AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE FLOODS MAY RESULT IN A MID-TERM SHORTFALL IN </p><p>FOODSTOCKS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE </p><p>POPULATIONS.  PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER IS THE HIGHEST </p><p>PRIORITY NEED AT THIS TIME.  OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR </p><p>RECOMMENDS OFDA/WASHINGTON CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL </p><p>FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THE FLOODS, FOCUSING ON </p><p>THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR, PENDING RECEIPT AND </p><p>APPROVAL OF FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BACKGROUND:  PER REF A, HEAVY RAINS HAVE AFFECTED THE </p><p>WESTERN, SOUTHERN AND SABARAGAMUWA PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA </p><p>RESULTING IN FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES IN KALUTARA, </p><p>RATNAPURA, GALLE AND MATARA DISTRICTS.  THE UNUSUALLY </p><p>HEAVY RAINS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEASONAL MONSOON; </p><p>HOWEVER, THE SITUATION HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY CYCLONIC </p><p>ACTIVITY IN THE BAY OF BENGAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  USAID/OFDA ASIA REGIONAL ADVISOR MARIZA ROGERS TRAVELED </p><p>TO COLOMBO MAY 21-25, 2003 TO ASSIST THE USAID MISSION </p><p>WITH THE FLOOD AND LANDSLIDE DISASTER IN THE SOUTHWESTERN </p><p>REGION OF SRI LANKA.  SHE WAS JOINED BY USAID/SRI LANKA </p><p>MDRO JESSICA DAVEY FOR COORDINATION MEETINGS IN COLOMBO </p><p>AND ASSESSMENTS IN THE DISTRICTS OF RATNAPURA, GALLE, </p><p>MATARA AND KALUTARA IN THREE SOUTHWESTERN PROVINCES OF SRI </p><p>LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CURRENT SITUATION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL) </p><p>CRISIS MANAGEMENT CENTER WITHIN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE HAS BEEN COLLECTING AND UPDATING THE FIGURES </p><p>CONCERNING THIS DISASTER FROM POLICE REPORTS, RELIEF </p><p>WORKERS AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENTS IN THE AFFECTED </p><p>DISTRICTS.  AS OF MAY 27, 2003, THE GSL REPORTS: 151,141 </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED; 250 DEATHS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED; 24,365 HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND 22,073 </p><p>HOMES HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY DAMAGED. WHILE FLOOD WATERS </p><p>REMAIN STANDING IN SOME DISTRICTS, ROAD ACCESS AND THE </p><p>REQUIRED ROAD CLEARANCE CONTINUE TO BE THE GREATEST </p><p>OBSTACLES TO DISTRIBUTION OF RELEIF IN THOSE AREAS. THE </p><p>METEOROLOGY DEPARTMENT HAS FORECAST MORE RAIN IN THE </p><p>AFFECTED AREAS AS PART OF THE SEASONAL MONSOON. </p><p>METEROLOGISTS ARE MONITORING THE EXISTING CONDITIONS, </p><p>FAVOURABLE FOR CYCLONES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RESPONSE TO DATE:  PER REF B, THE USG PROVIDED </p><p>IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE SRI LANKA RED CROSS WITH </p><p>A GRANT OF US$50,000 FOR RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>10,000 PEOPLE.  THE SUPPLIES WILL BE PROVIDED TO FAMILIES </p><p>WHOSE HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, OR THOSE WHO LOST MOST OF </p><p>THEIR HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS AS A RESULT OF THE FLOOD.  THE </p><p>RELIEF ITEMS INCLUDE BED SHEETS, COOKING SETS, SLEEPING </p><p>MATS, LANTERNS, BUCKETS, SOAP, AND BOTTLED WATER.  THESE </p><p>LOCALLY PROCURED ITEMS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PACKAGED AS </p><p>KITS BY RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS, AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO </p><p>THE AFFECTED FAMILIES SHORTLY.  IN ADDITION, PART OF THE </p><p>FUNDS WILL SUPPORT THE CLEANING AND REPAIR OF 100 WATER </p><p>WELLS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS OF MAY 26, 2003, DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RELIEF </p><p>EFFORTS AMOUNT TO MORE THAN US$ 2 MILLION ACCORDING TO </p><p>RELIEFWEB (WWW.RELIEFWEB.ORG).  DONOR COUNTRIES INCLUDE </p><p>JAPAN, NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, </p><p>INDIA AND SWEDEN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  RELIEF COORDINATION:  THE LEAD MINISTRY FOR COORDINATION </p><p>OF DISASTER RESPONSE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IS THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF POWER AND ENERGY; AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL, THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF SOCIAL WELFARE HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>RESPONSE.  AN OPERATIONS CENTER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED </p><p>WITHIN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE, WHERE INFORMATION ON </p><p>CASUALTIES, DAMAGES AND NEEDS ARE BEING COLLECTED.  THE UN </p><p>AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE INCLUDE U.N. HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR), WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>(WFP), UNICEF, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), AND UN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP).  THE UN OFFICE FOR </p><p>COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (OCHA) HAS FIELDED </p><p>ASSESSMENT TEAMS AND ALSO PROVIDED UN VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST </p><p>WITH COORDINATION OF RELIEF ACTIVITIES AT THE DISTRICT </p><p>LEVEL.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO INTERNATIONAL NGOS WORKING </p><p>IN THE AFFECTED AREAS, AND ONLY A FEW LOCAL COMMUNITY- </p><p>BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPERATIONAL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  RATNAPURA DISTRICT ASSESSMENT:  ON MAY 23, THE TEAM </p><p>VISITED RATNAPURA DISTRICT AND OBSERVED VARYING DEGREES OF </p><p>RECOVERY; WITHIN RATNAPURA TOWN THE ELECTRICITY HAD BEEN </p><p>RESTORED, AND FAMILIES WERE SHOVELING THE MUD AND DEBRIS </p><p>FROM THEIR HOMES; CLOTHES, FURNITURE AND SCHOOL BOOKS WERE </p><p>LAID OUT TO DRY ALONGSIDE THE ROADS. HOWEVER, BEYOND THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITY LIMITS, ROAD CLEARANCE AND REPAIR WAS </p><p>CONTINUING; MORE HOMES WERE PARTIALLY DAMAGED OR </p><p>DESTROYED, AND MANY PADDY FIELDS WERE WASHED AWAY.  THE </p><p>TEAM ATTEMPTED TO REACH A VILLAGE WHERE LOCALS REPORTED </p><p>THAT 40 OUT OF 75  FAMILIES WERE BURIED BY A LANDSLIDE. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE ROAD WAS TOO HEAVILY DAMAGED AND THE VILLAGE </p><p>COULD ONLY BE ACCESSED ON FOOT - ANOTHER 5 KILOMETERS </p><p>WALK.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LIMITED </p><p>RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR THE VILLAGERS HAD BEEN AIRDROPPED BY </p><p>MILITARY HELICOPTERS.  THERE WERE MANY REPORTS OF SUCH </p><p>ISOLATED AREAS AND SITUATIONS ALL OVER THE DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  KALUTARA AND GALLE DISTRICTS ASSESMENT:  ON MAY 23 AND </p><p>24, THE TEAM VISITED KALUTARA AND GALLE DISTRICTS, AND </p><p>OBSERVED A SIMILAR RETURN TO NORMALCY IN THE LARGER TOWNS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE TEAM NOTED THAT STANDING WATER AND RESIDUAL </p><p>MUD REMAINED IN MORE AREAS OF THESE DISTRICTS. WHILE FLOOD </p><p>WATERS IN THE HILL AREAS HAVE MOSTLY RECEDED, THE WATER </p><p>LEVELS IN THE LOWER LYING AREAS HAVE RISEN.  THE EXISTING </p><p>BUNDS IN THESE DISTRICTS HAVE BUFFERED SOME HOMES FROM THE </p><p>EFFECTS OF THE FLOOD, BUT APPEAR TO HAVE WORSENED THE </p><p>IMPACT IN OTHER AREAS.  IN EACH OF THE DISTRICTS, THE TEAM </p><p>SPOKE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SRI LANKA RED CROSS, </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENTS, AND THOSE DISPLACED FAMILIES, NOW </p><p>EVACUATED TO SCHOOLS, TEMPLES AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  NEEDS:  ACCORDING TO THE UN, THE RED CROSS AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, FOOD IS NOT AN URGENT REQUIREMENT AT </p><p>THIS TIME.  IN ADDITION TO PREPARED FOOD AND DRY RATIONS </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES, AND </p><p>THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WFP HAS DIVERTED SOME OF ITS </p><p>FOODSTOCKS TO THE FLOOD-AFFECTED AREAS.  FLOOD-RELATED </p><p>CROP DAMAGE MAY RESULT IN SOME MID-TERM SHORTFALL IN </p><p>FOODSTOCKS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE </p><p>POPULATIONS; THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION MAY REQUIRE </p><p>MONITORING.  NON-FOOD RELIEF ITEMS ARE BEING PROVIDED </p><p>THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR DONATIONS, WHILE THE </p><p>UN HAS PROVIDED ITEMS FROM ITS OWN STOCKPILE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AT </p><p>THIS TIME.  MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNAL WELLS </p><p>REMAIN FLOODED.  IN THE AREAS WHERE THE WATER HAS RECEDED, </p><p>THE WELLS HAVE SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, AND THE WATER </p><p>IS CONTAMINATED BY SEDIMENT AND DEBRIS.  DRINKING WATER IS </p><p>BEING DELIVERED BY LORRY AND TRACTOR MOUNTED BOWSERS TO </p><p>AREAS ALONG AND NEAR THE MAJOR ROADS; OUTLYING AREAS ARE </p><p>DEPENDENT UPON DISTRIBUTION OF BOTTLED WATER.  WHILE THERE </p><p>IS CONCERN ABOUT WATER-BORNE DISEASES, THERE ARE NO </p><p>CONCLUSIVE REPORTS OF INCREASED INCIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  RECOMMENDATION:  THE EMERGENCY PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER </p><p>IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE HEALTH STATUS OF PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>FLOOD-AFFECTED AREAS.  OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR RECOMMENDS </p><p>THAT OFDA/WASHINGTON CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS </p><p>FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THE FLOODS, FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR, PENDING RECEIPT AND APPROVAL </p><p>OF FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
