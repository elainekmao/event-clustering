<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 002479 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/NIS AND EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  2/5/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, RS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA: THE VEIL OF EXTREMISM </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS </p><p>JOHN M. ORDWAY.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, CHECHEN PRESIDENT </p><p>ASLAN MASKHADOV DECLARED A STATE OF SHARIA (ISLAMIC) </p><p>LAW TO BE IN EFFECT IN CHECHNYA.  ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN </p><p>PRESS REPORTS, MASKHADOV ASKED THE CHECHEN LEGISLATURE </p><p>AND THE COUNCIL OF MUFTIS TO DRAFT A SHARIA </p><p>CONSTITUTION WITHIN ONE MONTH\'S TIME.  OFFICIAL </p><p>REACTIONS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA </p><p>HAVE BEEN VARIED, BUT ANALYSTS SUGGEST SHARIA LAW MAY </p><p>BE PREFERABLE TO WAHHABIST EXTREMISM WHICH HAS </p><p>THREATENED THE REGION FOR MONTHS.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>OBSERVERS HERE AGREE THAT MASKHADOV\'S IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>SHARIA LAW, IN FACT, IS A THINLY-VEILED EFFORT TO </p><p>NEUTRALIZE HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS BY IMPLEMENTING DE </p><p>FACTO ABSOLUTE RULE IN CHECHNYA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>SHARIA ON THE HORIZON </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 3, FULL-SCALE SHARIA LAW WENT INTO </p><p>EFFECT IN CHECHNYA, THE INITIATIVE OF CHECHEN PRESIDENT </p><p>ASLAN MASKHADOV.  INTERFAX REPORTED THAT MASKHADOV </p><p>SIGNED SEVERAL DECREES STIPULATING THAT ALL LOCAL </p><p>LEGISLATION MUST BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE KORAN </p><p>AND SHARIA REGULATIONS.  THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW </p><p>IN CHECHNYA IS INTENDED TO STRIP THE CHECHEN </p><p>LEGISLATURE OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS, LEAVING THE </p><p>ELECTED BODY WITH NOTHING BUT SELECT OVERSIGHT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  IRONICALLY, THE LEGISLATORS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ORDERED BY MASKHADOV TO WRITE A SHARIA </p><p>CONSTITUTION FOR REVIEW IN ONE MONTH\'S TIME.  MASKHADOV </p><p>ALSO INSTRUCTED THE CHECHEN COUNCIL OF MUFTIS TO ASSIST </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARIANS WITH THIS TASK. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>"IF IT\'S ISLAMIC, IT CAN\'T BE GOOD" </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAS BEEN MIXED.  IVAN RYBKIN, </p><p>FORMER SECRETARY OF RUSSIA\'S SECURITY COUNCIL, TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS THAT MASKHADOV\'S DECISION IS IN DIRECT </p><p>CONTRADICTION TO THE CHECHEN CONSTITUTION DRAFTED </p><p>DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF DZHOKHAR DUDAYEV.  UNDER THE </p><p>DUDAYEV CONSTITUTION, THE CHECHEN REPUBLIC IS SUPPOSED </p><p>TO BE A SECULAR STATE, AND THE EQUALITY OF ALL </p><p>RELIGIONS IS EMPHASIZED.  THE DUDAYEV CONSTITUTION ALSO </p><p>STATES THAT THE LAWFULLY ELECTED PARLIAMENT OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC HAS NO RIGHT TO BE DISSOLVED BY ANYONE, NOR IS </p><p>IT ABLE TO DISSOLVE ITSELF.  RYBKIN STATED THAT "ONE </p><p>CANNOT EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD...FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF </p><p>SUCH A DECISION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAS </p><p>RECEIVED CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC REACTIONS FROM REGIONAL </p><p>ANALYSTS.  ALEKSEY MALASHENKO OF THE MOSCOW CARNEGIE </p><p>CENTER CALLED SHARIA LAW "A COMPROMISE BETWEEN ANARCHY </p><p>AND ANARCHY."  MALASHENKO BELIEVES THAT WITHOUT A </p><p>FIRMER GRIP ON THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC, MASKHADOV </p><p>WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO MORE THAN KEEP THE POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION AT A CONSTANT LOW BOIL.  THE ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>MASKHADOV, ACCORDING TO MALASHENKO, IS A MENTALLY </p><p>UNSTABLE GROUP OF OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDERS HEADED BY </p><p>SALMAN RADUYEV, SHAMIL BASAYEV, AND KHUNKOR-PASHA </p><p>ISRAPILOV.  MALASHENKO NOTES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>FACTOR IN A BASAYEV/ RADUYEV/ ISRAPILOV POWER OPTION IS </p><p>THAT IT MOST LIKELY WILL BE FUNDED BY EX-FIELD </p><p>COMMANDER AL-KHATTAB.  AL-KHATTAB IS A SAUDI NATIONAL </p><p>WITH WAHHABIST TENDENCIES WHO FAVORS A MORE MILITANT </p><p>VERSION OF ISLAMIC LAW THAN SHARIA.  (NOTE:  AL- </p><p>KHATTAB, IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMER FIELD COMMANDER </p><p>ARBI BARAYEV, IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>MOST HOSTAGE-TAKING IN THE REGION AS WELL AS THE </p><p>BEHEADING OF THE FOUR WESTERN HOSTAGES IN DECEMBER </p><p>1998.  AFTER THE HOSTAGE\'S HEADS WERE DISCOVERED, </p><p>MASKHADOV\'S GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED ITS DESIRE TO EXPEL </p><p>AL-KHATTAB FROM CHECHNYA, BUT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) VALENTIN VLASOV, FORMER HOSTAGE AND RUSSIAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO THE REGION, TOLD THE RUSSIAN MEDIA </p><p>THAT "NO FUSS SHOULD BE RAISED ABOUT THE DECISION" TO </p><p>INSTITUTE A STATE OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA.  FORMER </p><p>CHECHEN FOREIGN MINISTER MOVLADIY UDUGOV CALLED </p><p>MASKHADOV\'S MOVE THE "MOST CORRECT DECISION," AND </p><p>STATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW </p><p>WILL ALLOW MASKHADOV TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MASKHADOV\'S SEEMINGLY SNAP DECISION TO </p><p>INTRODUCE SHARIA LAW IS BEING VIEWED WITH MUCH </p><p>SKEPTICISM BY CHECHEN OPPOSITION FORCES AS WELL AS </p><p>CHECHNYA\'S NEIGHBORS.  ALTHOUGH THE TRUE NATURE OF </p><p>CHECHEN SHARIA LAW WILL NOT BECOME APPARENT UNTIL AFTER </p><p>A CONSTITUTION IS DRAFTED, PRESUMABLY SOME MEASURES OF </p><p>ISLAMIC INFLUENCE WILL BECOME MORE EVIDENT, IF ONLY AS </p><p>A FACADE.  ISLAMIC EXTREMISM ON ITS BORDERS IS </p><p>SOMETHING WHICH RUSSIA CONTINUES TO FEAR.  MASKHADOV\'S </p><p>MOVE COULD TOUCH OFF NEW FEARS IF HE IS UNABLE TO </p><p>CONTROL THE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM WITH WHICH ANALYSTS ARE </p><p>VIEWING MASKHADOV\'S MOVE IS PERHAPS MORE REALISTIC AND </p><p>DEVOID OF THE EMOTIONAL BIAS AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ISLAM </p><p>WHICH PREVAILS IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY TODAY.  RUSSIAN </p><p>POLITICIANS (E.G. PM PRIMAKOV, MINISTER FOR </p><p>NATIONALITIES ABDULATIPOV, AND DEPUTY PM FOR REGIONAL </p><p>AFFAIRS GUSTOV) HAVE INVESTED IN MASKHADOV\'S GOVERNMENT </p><p>BY OPENING NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSING PLANS FOR </p><p>IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE REGION WITH </p><p>HIM.  FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MASKHADOV HAS FACED SERIOUS </p><p>AND GROWING CHALLENGES TO HIS AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO </p><p>GOVERN CHECHNYA.  MASKHADOV HAS BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ANY SEMBLANCE OF ORDER IN CHECHNYA.  THE INTRODUCTION </p><p>OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA MAY BE VIEWED AS MASKHADOV\'S </p><p>ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HIS ISLAMIC EXTREMIST OPPOSITION, </p><p>WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CREATING THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH </p><p>HE CAN IMPOSE AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF ORDER WITH A </p><p>MODERATE LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
