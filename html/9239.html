<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 005570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ECON, EAIR, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: TOP HESSE CDU PLAYERS KOCH AND ROTH TUSSLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 2002 FRANKFURT 11843; B) FRANKFURT 392 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Hesse\'s two most powerful Christian </p><p>Democratic (CDU) politicians, Hesse\'s Minister President </p><p>Roland Koch and Frankfurt Lord Mayor Petra Roth have public </p><p>disagreements and competing national ambitions.  Roth was </p><p>elected in May 2003 as president of the German Council of </p><p>Cities.  Koch was reelected in February 2003 as Minister- </p><p>President of Hesse with an absolute majority.  They disagree </p><p>on major issues such as the expansion of Frankfurt airport </p><p>and regional reform.  Though Roth is losing support in the </p><p>Hesse state CDU, she remains very popular in Frankfurt.  Her </p><p>public opposition to Koch\'s initiatives could create </p><p>problems for the Hesse Minister-President for the remainder </p><p>of his second term.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The media have reported a serious rift between </p><p>Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch and Frankfurt Lord </p><p>Mayor Petra Roth (both CDU).  The Frankfurter Neue Presse, a </p><p>left-of-center newspaper, quotes CDU politicians\' </p><p>description of icy relations between the two influential </p><p>Hesse leaders that date back to Roth\'s re-election as Mayor </p><p>of Frankfurt two years ago.  Roth had distanced herself from </p><p>Koch, who was then entangled in a party financing scandal. </p><p>Roth denies allegations of tensions, stating that, "There </p><p>are several politicians in Wiesbaden who want to fabricate a </p><p>rift that does not exist."  She does admit that she tends to </p><p>compensate with her outspoken views for what she perceives </p><p>as Frankfurt\'s insufficient representation in the state </p><p>parliament.  "Frankfurt is Hesse\'s most important urban </p><p>center," says Roth\'s assistant, "But we only have twelve </p><p>deputies in state parliament (out of 100).  Frankfurt lacks </p><p>a strong lobby." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Roth and Koch, publicly clash on: </p><p> </p><p>  -    Frankfurt airport expansion.  Koch supports it, Roth </p><p>     rejects the selected variant, because due to the potential </p><p>     increase in noise for residents near Frankfurt; </p><p>-    Regional reform. Roth would like more responsibility </p><p>for a regional (multi-state) body led by Frankfurt to </p><p>facilitate administrative, economic and cultural </p><p>cooperation.  Koch intends to limit Frankfurt\'s influence; </p><p>-    Privatization of the Frankfurt Trade Fair, a huge </p><p>exhibition center in downtown Frankfurt.  Koch supports </p><p>selling Hesse\'s 40 percent share.  Roth is against selling </p><p>the city of Frankfurt\'s 60 percent share. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Since Lord Mayor Petra Roth was elected head of the </p><p>German Council of Cities May 15, 2003, she has been de facto </p><p>Hesse\'s second most powerful politician.  Roth\'s </p><p>relationship with the Chairman of the Frankfurt CDU, Udo </p><p>Corts is especially problematic.  Udo Corts is Hesse </p><p>Minister of Higher Education and former state Interior </p><p>Minister.  He is a rising star in Koch\'s cabinet, and a </p><p>favorite of the Minister-President.  In a meeting with the </p><p>Consul General in June, Corts openly expressed his dislike </p><p>of Roth.  Corts said that Roth is losing support in the </p><p>state CDU due to her reputation for unreliability and open </p><p>resistance to Koch\'s initiatives.  Corts said not only Koch, </p><p>but other cabinet members, are wondering what Roth\'s goals </p><p>really are.  Corts also said it was, "far from certain that </p><p>Roth will be re-nominated by the state CDU, if her track </p><p>record does not improve." (Note: Roth was re-elected for a </p><p>six-year term in 2001.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment: Koch and Roth are both ambitious </p><p>politicians who have set their sights on national office: </p><p>Koch for Chancellor (2006), Roth for Federal President </p><p>(2004).  Both know that it would be virtually impossible for </p><p>two Hesse politicians to hold these offices at the same time </p><p>and the competition adds to the tension between them. </p><p>(Note: Despite her ambitions, most observers put Roth\'s </p><p>chances of becoming Federal President at close to zero.) </p><p>Koch\'s drive to redesign the administrative structure of the </p><p>region is perceived as a threat by Roth and others across </p><p>the Frankfurt political party spectrum.  The tension between </p><p>Hesse\'s competitive Minister-President Roland Koch and </p><p>Frankfurt\'s vocal Lord Mayor Petra Roth could make Koch\'s </p><p>second term more difficult than his absolute majority might </p><p>indicate.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
