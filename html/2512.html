ON WFP\'S SIZABLE CASH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, </p><p>THE BOARD REQUESTED THAT A DETAILED ANALYSIS BE PROVIDED OF </p><p>THE REASONS FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL OF CASH BALANCES AND THAT </p><p>AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CASH BALANCES BE INDICATED BY WFP\'S </p><p>SECRETARIAT LATEST OCTOBER 2002.

THIS SESSION MARKED THE FINAL </p><p>BOARD APPEARANCE OF CATHERINE BERTINI WHOSE TENURE AS WFP\'S </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AFTER TEN YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE, </p><p>ENDS APRIL 5. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>CATHERINE BERTINI\'S REPLACEMENT - "IN LOGIC PROCESS AND </p><p>RESULTS ARE EQUIVALENT. (THEREFORE NO SURPRISES)." </p><p></p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ON MONDAY AFTERNOON FEBRUARY 11, THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF </p><p>FAO DR. JACQUES DIOUF ADDRESSED THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE INTENTION OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND </p><p>HIMSELF AS DG FAO TO APPOINT JAMES T. MORRIS (AMCIT) AS THE </p><p>NEXT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WORLD FOOD PROGRAM EFFECTIVE </p><p>APRIL 2002. SEVERAL OECD MEMBERS TOOK STRONG OBJECTION TO </p><p>THE ANNOUNCEMENT CLAIMING THAT THE SPIRIT OF WFP\'S GENERAL </p><p>REGULATION (ARTICLE VII.2) WHICH REQUIRES THAT "THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHALL BE APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL (FAO) AFTER CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH THE BOARD" HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY FOLLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE LEGAL COUNSEL OF FAO WAS ASK TO APPEAR BEFORE THE </p><p>BOARD AND PROVIDE A LEGAL OPINION ON THE MEANING OF </p><p>"CONSULTATION." THE OPINION RENDERED IS AS FOLLOWS: "WITH </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM \'CONSULTATION\', </p><p>THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS HAS CONSISTENTLY TAKEN THE </p><p>POSITION THAT THE MEANING OF THE EXPRESSION \'IN </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH\' AND \'AFTER CONSULTATION WITH\' IN THE </p><p>PRACTICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE </p><p>VIEWS OF THE PARTIES CONSULTED ARE SOUGHT OR ASCERTAINED, </p><p>AND THAT IT MUST BE DISTINGUISHED FROM \'AGREEMENT\', </p><p>\'CONCURRENCE\' OR \'CONSENT\'." </p><p> </p><p>4. THE BOARD WAS HOWEVER CAREFUL TO SEPARATE THE SPECIFIC </p><p>CANDIDACY AND QUALIFICATIONS OF JAMES T. MORRIS FROM THIS </p><p>ARGUMENT ON PROCESS, AND "REQUESTED THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>BOARD TO ADDRESS THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TO INFORM </p><p>HIM OF THE DESIRE OF THE BOARD TO WORK WITH HIM IN CLOSE </p><p>AND HARMONIOUS COLLABORATION." </p><p> </p><p>5. ON A SEPARATE ITEM UNDER "OTHER BUSINESS," THE BOARD </p><p>"REGRETTED THAT THE CURRENT APPLICATION OF ARTICLE VII.2 </p><p>HAD NOT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT A CLEAR AND </p><p>SATISFACTORY CONSULTATION," AND "PROPOSED THAT MEASURES BE </p><p>TAKEN TO CARRY OUT FUTURE CONSULTATIONS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>MANNER. TO THAT END, IT REQUESTED THE BUREAU TO EXAMINE THE </p><p>MATTER AND TO REPORT BACK TO THE BOARD." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>BERTINI ANALYZES "A DECADE OF CHANGE" AT WFP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. CATHERINE BERTINI OPENED THE BOARD SESSION ON FEBRUARY </p><p>11 BY DESCRIBING KEY CHANGES AT WFP OVER THE PERIOD 1992- </p><p>2002, AND SUMMARIZED THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN. SHE </p><p>FOCUSED ON HOW WFP HAS BUILT ITS CAPACITY TO DELIVER FOOD </p><p>AID TO THE HUNGRY POOR. KEY STEPS INCLUDE THE USD 40 </p><p>MILLION FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (FMIP), </p><p>EXTENSIVE DECENTRALIZATION, INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF GENDER </p><p>EQUALITY, SHARPENING THE GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING OF FOOD AID </p><p>FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND THE ORGANIZATION\'S ENHANCED EMERGENCY </p><p>RESPONSE CAPABILITY. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>7. IN 2001, BERTINI COMMENTED THAT WFP SHIPPED 3.9 MILLION </p><p>METRIC TONS, MEETING 83 PERCENT OF OVERALL TONNAGE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. CONFIRMED CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALED NEARLY USD </p><p>1.9 BILLION. BERTINI REGRETTED THAT FOOD AID FOR WFP\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO HAD FURTHER DECLINED TO USD 273 </p><p>MILLION (14.4 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL PROGRAM) DESPITE THE </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL CY 2001 U.S. GLOBAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION </p><p>INITIATIVE CONTRIBUTION. SHE POINTED OUT THAT THE TOP FIVE </p><p>DONORS (UNITED STATES, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, JAPAN, THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY) HAD CONTRIBUTED 80 PERCENT OF </p><p>WFP\'S 2001 BUDGET AND REMARKED ON WFP\'S NEED TO BROADEN ITS </p><p>DONOR BASE WITH OTHER OECD COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>8. BERTINI DIRECTLY ADDRESSED A NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>TOPICS. ON THE ISSUE OF "SURPLUS COMMODITIES" (FROM THE </p><p>UNITED STATES UNDER SECTION 416(B)), SHE ASKED: "WHAT IS </p><p>WRONG WITH SURPLUS WHEN IT IS TARGETED TO CHRONICALLY FOOD </p><p>INSECURE POPULATIONS?" SHE RENEWED HER APPEAL FOR GREATER </p><p>UN SECURITY ATTENTION FOR HUMANITARIAN STAFF IN </p><p>EMERGENCIES, COMMENTING THAT "OF THE 200 PLUS UN STAFF </p><p>KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY OVER THE PAST DECADE, ONLY 3 </p><p>CULPRITS WERE EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THESE </p><p>UN STAFFERS." </p><p></p><p> </p><p>9. SHE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON UN REFORM </p><p>ISSUES. BERTINI REITERATED THAT ALL UN ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD </p><p>HAVE TERM LIMITS; THAT DONOR GOVERNMENTS SHOULD REQUIRE </p><p>CLOSER COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE WORLD BANK/IMF AND UN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT/RELIEF AGENCIES; THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR </p><p>GREATER STAFF INTERCHANGE BETWEEN THE THREE UN AGENCIES </p><p>BASED IN ROME; THAT DONORS SHOULD CALL A HALT TO THE EVER </p><p>INCREASING NUMBER OF UN "SUMMITS;" AND THAT THE BOARD </p><p>SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON BROAD STRATEGIC ISSUES (E.G., </p><p>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS, UN AGENCIES WORKING WITH THE </p><p>MILITARY IN RELIEF OPERATIONS) RATHER THAN ON INDIVIDUAL </p><p>PROJECT APPROVALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS AND EC COMMISSIONER NEILSON RESPOND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. BOTH USAID ADMINISTRATOR ANDREW NATSIOS AND EC </p><p>COMMISSIONER (DEVELOPMENT) POUL NEILSON ADDRESSED THE BOARD </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 11. NATSIOS ON BEHALF OF THE USG THANKED </p><p>BERTINI FOR TEN YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>WORLD\'S HUNGRY POOR, COMMENTING THAT "THE OUTSTANDING </p><p>EFFORTS OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND HER STAFF OVER THIS </p><p>PAST DECADE HAVE GREATLY ADVANCED BOTH WFP\'S INTERNAL </p><p>REFORMS AND THE OVERALL UN REFORM AGENDA." NATSIOS NOTED </p><p>THAT OVERALL DONOR SUPPORT TO WFP 1992-2001 TOTALED USD </p><p>15.54 BILLION, OF WHICH THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTED USD </p><p>6.38 BILLION (41 PERCENT). NOTE: WITHIN THE UN-SYSTEM, ONLY </p><p>THE UNDP SURPASSES WFP IN DONOR SUPPORT. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>11. NATSIOS SPECIFICALLY CITED WFP EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>WHERE, SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, WFP HAD DELIVERED NEARLY 300,000 </p><p>METRIC TONS OF FOOD AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE AVERAGING MORE </p><p>THAN 2,000 TONS PER DAY TO ASSIST SOME 6.6 MILLION PEOPLE. </p><p>HE FURTHER NOTED THAT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE FOOD THAT </p><p>WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN OVER THIS PERIOD THROUGH WFP CAME </p><p>FROM THE UNITED STATES. IN GENERAL, HE LAUDED THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT STEPS TAKEN BY WFP OVER THE PAST DECADE TOWARDS </p><p>STRENGTHENING ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE (SERC) CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p>12. NATSIOS ASSURED MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD THAT THE </p><p>U.S. REMAINS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN </p><p>SUPPLYING FOOD AID TO VULNERABLE PEOPLE. HE COMMENTED THAT </p><p>SUPPORT FOR FOOD AID IS EVEN MORE VITAL IN THIS NEW ERA OF </p><p>TERRORIST THREATS AS HUNGER LEADS TO DESPERATION, AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY, VIOLENCE. HE UNDERLINED HOWEVER THAT IT IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT THAT WFP BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>MEASURABLE PROGRESS AND REAL IMPACT IN ITS FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>13. EC COMMISSIONER (DEVELOPMENT) POUL NIELSON REMARKED </p><p>THAT THE EC, WHILE "AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO WFP," WAS </p><p>NOT "AN EASY PARTNER." HE QUESTIONED THE PRESENT MODE OF </p><p>CALCULATING INDIRECT SUPPORT COSTS, POSTULATED THAT THE </p><p>PRESENT ISC RATE WAS "TOO HIGH," AND REQUESTED THAT A </p><p>REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE RATE BE INSTITUTED BY OCTOBER </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>14. NEILSON PROCEEDED TO CLARIFY THE EC POSITION ON FOOD </p><p>AID AS FOLLOWS: "WE DO NOT REGARD FOOD AID AS AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENT TO CREATE LONG-TERM FOOD SECURITY, </p><p>BUT RATHER AS AN ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENT FOR EMERGENCY AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTIONS TO LINKING RELIEF, </p><p>REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND AS AN ELEMENT OF SAFETY </p><p>NET STRATEGIES FOR PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE SECTIONS OF THE </p><p>POPULATION." HE INDICATED THAT THE EC WOULD MAKE SURE THAT </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FOOD AID "BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE ATTENTION IN THE </p><p>WTO TRADE AGENDA." </p><p> </p><p>15. ON WFP\'S PRROS, NEILSON URGED FURTHER WFP THINKING, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON LINKING IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND EMERGENCY </p><p>INTERVENTIONS TO RECOVERY/DEVELOPMENT. ON RESULTS-BASED </p><p>MANAGEMENT, HE OPINED THAT "MOST OF THE DONORS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE EC HAVE NOT YET DELIVERED. EVERYONE IS ASKING FOR </p><p>INDICATORS. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO PRETEND THAT THE </p><p>WORLD IS SIMPLER THAN IT REALLY IS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>WFP CASH MANAGEMENT AND REVIEW OF WFP FINANCIAL BALANCES OF </p><p>PROJECTS CLOSED PRIOR TO 2001 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. THE BOARD NOTED THE PRESENT LEVEL OF WFP\'S CASH </p><p>BALANCES, AND REVIEWED THE ORGANIZATION\'S LEVEL OF </p><p>FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AND INVESTMENT POLICY. ON CASH </p><p>BALANCES, IT REQUESTED THAT A DETAILED ANALYSIS BE PROVIDED </p><p>OF THE REASON FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL OF CASH BALANCES AND </p><p>THAT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CASH BALANCES BE INDICATED BY </p><p>WFP\'S SECRETARIAT LATEST OCTOBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>17. ON ACCOUNTS CLOSED PRIOR TO 2001 AND RECENTLY MIGRATED </p><p>INTO THE NEW WFP INFORMATION NETWORK AND GLOBAL SYSTEM </p><p>(WINGS), THE BOARD ASK THE SECRETARIAT TO COMPLETE ITS </p><p>ANALYSIS AND ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL DONORS </p><p>TO CLEAR ALL CONTRIBUTIONS AND BALANCES OF CLOSED PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>18. ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS COMMENTED THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>HAD OFTEN RAISED THE ISSUE OF WFP\'S SIZABLE CASH BALANCES </p><p>AND THAT THESE AMOUNTS SHOULD BE REASONABLY MODEST. HE </p><p>ENDORSED THE POSITION OF THE UN\'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY QUESTIONS (ACABQ) THAT THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM PROVIDE SOONEST A DETAILED ANALYSIS AS </p><p>TO THE APPROPRIATE CASH BALANCE LEVEL NEEDED TO CONDUCT ITS </p><p>BUSINESS. </p><p></p><p>19. HE SUPPORTED THE POSITION OF THE EC (PARA 13 ABOVE) </p><p>THAT THE WFP PRESENT ITS ANALYSIS OF INDIRECT SUPPORT COSTS </p><p>(ISC) TO THE MAY 2002 EXECUTIVE BOARD AND THAT ADJUSTMENTS </p><p>BE MADE AT THAT TIME IN ITS PERCENTAGE RATE, APPLICABLE FOR </p><p>CY 2002 ISC CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>20. FINALLY, NATSIOS ALSO FAVORED TASKING WFP\'S EXTERNAL </p><p>AUDITOR TO PROVIDE ITS CONSIDERED OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>THE APPROPRIATE CASH BALANCE LEVEL AT THE TIME OF ITS </p><p>PRESENTATION OF THE 2000-2001 BIENNIUM ACCOUNTS IN OCTOBER </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS - PRROS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>21. PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS FOR UGANDA </p><p>(USD 102.9 MILLION); ETHIOPIA (USD 40.36 MILLION); </p><p>INDONESIA/INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND URBAN POOR (USD 65.5 </p><p>MILLION); BURMA/NORTH RAKINE STATE RETURNEES (USD 6.84 </p><p>MILLION); NEPAL/BHUTANESE REFUGEES (USD 8.5 MILLION) </p><p>SUDAN/ERITREAN REFUGEES (USD 7.43 MILLION); AND THE FEDERAL </p><p>REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (EXCLUDING KOSOVO) (USD 16.53 </p><p>MILLION) -TOTALING OVERALL USD 248.13 MILLION- WERE </p><p>APPROVED EN BLOC BY THE BOARD. NOTE: USDEL MET SEPARATELY </p><p>WITH WFP REGIONAL MANAGERS ON THESE AND OTHER MAJOR WFP </p><p>OPERATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE REGIONS. SEPTEL WILL PROVIDE </p><p>AN UPDATE ON THE ALGERIA PRRO - ASSISTANCE TO WESTERN </p><p>SAHARA REFUGEES. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>APPROVED COUNTRY PROGRAMS - 2002-2007 - WFP\'S 2002 </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO FUNDING IN SERIOUS TROUBLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>22. THE BOARD APPROVED COUNTRY PROGRAMS FOR THE FOLLOWING </p><p>COUNTRIES: BHUTAN, USD 14.7 MILLION; AND YEMEN, USD 40 </p><p>MILLION. IN ADDITION, A COUNTRY STRATEGY OUTLINE FOR </p><p>MAURITANIA WAS APPROVED. </p><p> </p><p>23. ON THE WIDER ISSUE OF GLOBAL FOOD AID NEEDS FOR WFP\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO FOR CY 2002, THESE ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>ESTIMATED AT 1.2 MILLION TONS VALUED AT USD 389 MILLION. </p><p>BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXPECTED LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>AND THE AMOUNT OF CARRY-OVER PLEDGES FROM 2001, WFP </p><p>ESTIMATES A CURRENT SHORTFALL OF 571,000 METRIC TONS (USD </p><p>180.2 MILLION), OR 46 PERCENT OF REQUIREMENTS. THE FORECAST </p><p>AVAILABILITY, 660,000 METRIC TONS (USD 208.8 MILLION) </p><p>REPRESENTS THE LOWEST LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CATEGORY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>HARMONIZATION OF PROGRAMMING PROCESSES AMONG THE UN FUNDS </p><p>AND PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>24. THE BOARD REQUESTED THE SECRETARIAT TO PRODUCE AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL AND MORE DETAILED REPORT PURSUANT TO GENERAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION A/56/201 "TRIENNIAL POLICY REVIEW OF </p><p>OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS SYSTEM." IT RECOMMENDED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE ROME - AND NEW YORK - BASED BOARDS OF THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS FUNDS AND PROGRAMS BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH </p><p>WFP BOARD PARTICIPATION IN THE JOINT MEETING(S) OF THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARDS OF UNDP/UNFPA AND UNICEF. </p><p> </p><p>25. USDEL APPLAUDED THE RECENTLY ISSUED "IDEAS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE COMMON COUNTRY ASSESSMENT (CCA)/ UNITED </p><p>NATIONS DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK (UNDAF) PROCESS," BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF DENMARK, FINLAND, NORWAY AND SWEDEN (OCTOBER </p><p>2001) - THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EITHER DEVELOPED OR ARE </p><p>DEVELOPING BROAD-BASED NATIONAL POVERTY REDUCTION </p><p>STRATEGIES (PRSP) AND HENCE CCA/UNDAF GUIDELINES "BE </p><p>ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS MAJOR AND POSITIVE CHANGE." </p><p> </p><p>26. USDEL ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WFP PURSUE WITH OTHER UN </p><p>AGENCIES, AS PART OF THE UNDAF PROCESS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>COMMON TOOLS TO MONITOR PROGRESS AND EVALUATE </p><p>OUTCOMES/RESULTS OF THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY PROGRAMS, AS </p><p>RECOMMENDED AT THE ANNUAL SESSION OF THE UNDP/UNFPA 2001 </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>PAPER ON NON-FOOD COMPONENTS OF RELIEF INTERVENTION IN THE </p><p>HORN OF AFRICA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>27. THE PRINCIPAL FINDING OF THIS PAPER RELATED TO THE CY </p><p>2000 DROUGHT IN THE HORN OF AFRICA WAS THAT, IN ORDER TO </p><p>ENABLE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES TO EFFECTIVELY RECOVER FROM </p><p>DROUGHTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE, BOTH FOOD AND NON-FOOD </p><p>SHORTFALLS NEEDED TO BE RESOURCED AS A MATTER OF PRIORITY. </p><p>IN SHORT, IN ADDITION TO FOOD, URGENT DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>WERE REQUIRED PARTICULARLY FOR INTERVENTIONS IN THE WATER, </p><p>HEALTH, LIVESTOCK, AGRICULTURAL AND SEED SECTORS. FOOD AID </p><p>ALONE AS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS NOT ENOUGH. </p><p> </p><p>28. USDEL COMMENTED THAT, GIVEN RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, THERE </p><p>IS A CLEAR NEED FOR UN AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO BETTER </p><p>DEMONSTRATE COST EFFICIENCIES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND THE </p><p>UN\'S ABILITY, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TO OBTAIN HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>SUPPORT. MOREOVER, THE UN AGENCIES NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT </p><p>RIGOR IS SYSTEMATICALLY APPLIED TO THE CONSOLIDATED APPEALS </p><p>(CAP) PROCESS IN ORDER TO AVOID "INFLATING THE NUMBERS." </p><p>THE UPCOMING UN CAP REVIEW (MONTREUX) SHOULD PROVIDE A GOOD </p><p>UN INTERAGENCY AND DONOR FORUM TO FURTHER "STREAMLINE" THE </p><p>CAP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOMAGE TO OUTGOING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BERTINI </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p></p><p>29.

THERE WAS NO DOWN SIDE TO THIS TRIBUTE. IN SHORT, </p><p>UNIVERSAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A JOB WELL DONE. INDEED, AS </p><p>ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED BY UNICEF\'S CAROL BELLAMY: "FOR ME, AS </p><p>FOR OTHERS, CATHERINE HAS BEEN MORE THAN A GIFTED LEADER. </p><p>SHE HAS BEEN A GOOD AND LOYAL COLLEAGUE-AND A TRUE FRIEND. </p><p>I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS OF ONE NEW YORK GIRL TO </p><p>ANOTHER-CATHERINE THE UPSTATER AND ME THE CITY GIRL. I </p><p>THINK I SPEAK FOR A MULTITUDE-MILLIONS OF WHOM MAY NEVER </p><p>EVEN KNOW HER NAME-WHO WILL MISS HER VERY MUCH." </p><p> </p><p>31.
