ROME 1754 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  ITALY ANSWERED THE CALL TO ASSIST THE </p><p>COALITION WIN THE WAR IN IRAQ.  THE GOI MADE A STRATEGIC </p><p>CHOICE TO KEEP ITS POLICY ALIGNED WITH THE U.S. AND STUCK TO </p><p>IT, DESPITE INTENSE INTERNAL POLITICAL PRESSURE TO FOLD. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02045  01 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>ITALY DID NOT SHY AWAY FROM THIS CHOICE, AGREEING TO BE NAMED </p><p>PUBLICLY AS A COALITION MEMBER.  TOP OFFICIALS SPOKE OUT </p><p>REPEATEDLY AND FORCEFULLY ON THE NEED TO ENSURE IRAQI </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH UN RESOLUTIONS.  THEY STOOD UP FOR OUR </p><p>OBJECTIVES AT THE UN, SPOKE OUT AGAINST IRAQ\'S WAR CRIMES, </p><p>AND EXPELLED IRAQI DIPLOMATS FROM ITALIAN SOIL.  OUR CONTACTS </p><p>GAVE US HEARTBURN WITH THEIR PENCHANT FOR NOTIFYING THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT ABOUT OPERATIONAL MINUTIA, BUT IN THE END REGULAR </p><p>CONSULTATION KEPT POTENTIALLY UNRULY LEGISLATORS IN LINE AND </p><p>OPSEC WAS PROTECTED.  WHEN PRESIDENT CIAMPI SEEMED ON THE </p><p>VERGE OF CALLING INTO CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION THE DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF THE U.S. ARMY\'S 173RD AIRBORNE BRIGADE DIRECTLY TO IRAQ </p><p>FROM ITALIAN SOIL, THE GOI WORKED TACTICS WITH US TO ADDRESS </p><p>HIS CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE U.S. MILITARY WAS </p><p>OUTSTANDING.  WE GOT WHAT WE ASKED FOR ON BASE ACCESS, </p><p>TRANSIT, AND OVERFLIGHTS, ENSURING THAT FORCES -- INCLUDING </p><p>TROOPS ON CIVILIAN CHARTER JETS -- COULD FLOW SMOOTHLY </p><p>THROUGH ITALY TO GET TO THE FIGHT.  ITALIAN AIRFIELDS, PORTS, </p><p>AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE WERE PLACED AT OUR DISPOSAL. </p><p>AUGUSTA BAY, SICILY BECAME A MAJOR RESUPPLY HUB, OVER 1,000 </p><p>MISSIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AT THE SIGONELLA NAS, </p><p>AND AVIANO SUPPORTED THE LARGEST COMBAT MOVEMENT OF C-17S IN </p><p>HISTORY FROM ITALIAN SOIL.  MOREOVER, LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>AUTHORITIES PREVENTED DETERMINED PROTESTERS FROM STOPPING </p><p>TRAINS AND TRUCKS TRANSPORTING U.S. EQUIPMENT ACROSS ITALY TO </p><p>STAGING AREAS FOR DELIVERY TO SW ASIA.  FORCE PROTECTION WAS </p><p>BUMPED UP AT U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THROUGHOUT ITALY AND </p><p>THE GOI GRANTED VIRTUALLY ALL OUR REQUESTS TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>U.S. VESSELS TRANSITING AUGUSTA BAY IN SUPPORT OF OIF WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02045  01 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>ADEQUATELY PROTECTED.  THE GOI IS NOW MOVING AT A STEADY PACE </p><p>TO FILL OUT A RELIEF AND PHASE IV STABILIZATION PACKAGE. </p><p>ITALY IS PLANNING TO SPEND EUROS 79 MILLION ON RELIEF, IS </p><p>DEPLOYING A FIELD HOSPITAL, AND IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE </p><p>UK TO STAND UP A BRIGADE-SIZE ARMY FORCE (COMPLEMENTED BY </p><p>CARABINIERI) IN THE BRITISH SECTOR IN SOUTHERN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE LEARNED SEVERAL LESSONS FROM WORKING WITH THE GOI </p><p>ON OIF.  FOR ANY FUTURE MILITARY OPERATIONS THAT INVOLVE </p><p>ITALY, KEEPING DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATION IN SYNC WITH THE </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY CHANNEL WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING </p><p>THE RIGHT RESULTS, QUICKLY.  PRESIDENT CIAMPI CANNOT BE </p><p>IGNORED ON INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.  WHITE HOUSE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT WOULD, WE ARE CONVINCED, PAY </p><p>DIVIDENDS.  WHILE THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT CAN BE TRUSTED TO </p><p>MANAGE THE INTERNAL POLITICS OF THORNY SECURITY QUESTIONS, </p><p>HAD A DIFFERENT COALITION BEEN IN POWER--IN PARTICULAR ONE </p><p>CONTROLLED BY THE CENTER-LEFT--THE RIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>BUMPIER.  ITALY\'S INTERAGENCY PROCESS IS IMPROVING, BUT STILL </p><p>INHIBITS THE SMOOTH MESHING OF INTENT WITH CONCRETE ACTION. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE HAVE REFUSED TO ACT AS THE GOI\'S "MANAGEMENT </p><p>CONSULTANT," WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HELP ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0795 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02045  02 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    OIGO-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------63C246  121722Z /38 </p><p>P 121721Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9807 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY VATICAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>COMUSNAVEUR LONDON UK PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF ARMY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>HQ USAF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECNAV WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 06 ROME 002045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02045  02 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J5, POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, IT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: REVIEW OF ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIF </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT TALK TO, RATHER THAN PAST EACH OTHER.  ALL SAID, </p><p>THE EMBASSY REMAINS CONVINCED THAT ITALY IS AN EXCELLENT </p><p>PLACE TO DO OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY BUSINESS, NOT LEAST </p><p>BECAUSE THE COUNTRY\'S MUCH-MALIGNED BUREAUCRACY HAS A CASTE </p><p>OF TOP-NOTCH PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>HELP US GET THE OPERATIONAL JOB DONE ON OIF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>OVERVIEW OF ITALY OIF CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AS THE COALITION SWITCHES GEARS AND MOVES FULL SPEED </p><p>AHEAD WITH PHASE IV, WE WANTED TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITALY\'S </p><p>MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIF AND HIGHLIGHT SOME LESSONS LEARNED </p><p>ABOUT WORKING WITH THE GOI.  IT WAS A BUMPY RIDE AND WE WERE </p><p>AT TIMES FRUSTRATED THAT THE GOI COULD NOT MOVE ON OUR </p><p>REQUESTS AS RAPIDLY AS WE MIGHT HAVE PREFERRED.  HOWEVER, IF </p><p>TANGIBLE RESULTS ARE WHAT COUNT, THEN BY ANY MEASURABLE </p><p>STANDARD ITALY SCORES WELL; INDEED VERY WELL.  THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT BROUGHT A COUNTRY ROUNDLY OPPOSED TO WAR AS CLOSE </p><p>AS IT COULD POLITICALLY TO THE BRINK OF BELLIGERENT STATUS. </p><p>WITHOUT THE PRESSURE OF THE VATICAN, SEVERE POLITICAL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02045  02 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO CONFLICT, AND UNEASE WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNING COALITION ABOUT THE USE OF FORCE, THE GOI MIGHT </p><p>HAVE DONE EVEN MORE.  AS IT WAS, ITALY, ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT </p><p>PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND, DID MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>HELPING THE COALITION WIN THE WAR IN IRAQ.  NOW, IT IS </p><p>HELPING ENSURE THAT STABILIZATION TAKES HOLD AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION CAN BEGIN.  WE THINK THERE IS A GOOD STORY </p><p>HERE AND ONE WORTH REFLECTING ON.  NEVERTHELESS, FOR THOSE </p><p>READERS WHO PREFER ONLY A SNAPSHOT OF ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS, </p><p>WE BEGIN WITH THE FACTS. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>- ITALY AGREED TO BE NAMED PUBLICLY AS COALITION MEMBER </p><p>- GOI OPPOSED EFFORTS IN UN TO CRITICIZE U.S. IRAQ POLICY </p><p>- GOI EXPELLED FOUR IRAQI OFFICIALS SUSPECTED OF INTELLIGENCE </p><p>TIES </p><p>- GOI MAINTAINED PARLIAMENTARY BACKING FOR IRAQ POLICY </p><p>- GOI ENSURED THAT PRESIDENT CIAMPI DID NOT CHALLENGE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 173RD BRIGADE\'S DEPLOYMENT FROM VICENZA </p><p>TO NORTHERN IRAQ, THE LARGEST COMBAT AIR DROP SINCE WW II </p><p> </p><p>LOGISTICAL SUPPORT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>- GOI SUPPORTED 124 GLOBEMASTER TAKEOFFS/LANDINGS AT AVIANO, </p><p>THE LARGEST EVER COMBAT MOVEMENT OF C-17S </p><p>- GOI ASSISTED IN SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF SOME 1,300 </p><p>MISSIONS FROM SIGONELLA NAS </p><p>- GOI AGREED TO OUR REQUEST TO USE SIGONELLA AS DIVERT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02045  02 OF 06  121721Z </p><p>AIRFIELD FOR OVERFLIGHT OF WMD SAMPLES </p><p>- ITALIAN PORTS HOSTED 71 U.S. VESSELS </p><p>- AUGUSTA BAY, SICILY SERVED AS MAJOR RESUPPLY HUB </p><p>- U.S. CHARTER FLIGHTS TRANSPORTING OVER 8000 TROOPS TO SW </p><p>ASIA TOUCHED DOWN ON ITALIAN CIVIL/MILITARY AIRFIELDS </p><p>- GOI PREVENTED PROTESTERS FROM DISRUPTING FLOW OF </p><p>MEN/MATERIEL THROUGH ITALY, INCLUDING COMPLEX MOVES IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE 173RD\'S DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>FORCE PROTECTION SUPPORT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>- LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES CONTINUED CLOSE COOPERATION </p><p>WITH U.S. BASE COMMANDERS TO PREVENT SERIOUS INCIDENTS </p><p>- MAJOR FP INCREASE/SUPPORT AT SIGONELLA AND AUGUSTA BAY </p><p>INCLUDING ARMED ITALIAN NAVY ESCORT, ROVING GUARDS, NEW </p><p>WATERSIDE SECURITY SYSTEM </p><p>- U.S. NAVY SHIPS ALLOWED TO CONDUCT UNARMED TRAINING </p><p>EXERCISES IN ITALIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS </p><p> </p><p>HUMANITARIAN/PHASE IV SUPPORT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0798 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02045  03 OF 06  121722Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /003W </p><p>                  ------------------63C25B  121722Z /38 </p><p>P 121721Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9808 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY VATICAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>COMUSNAVEUR LONDON UK PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF ARMY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>HQ USAF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECNAV WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 06 ROME 002045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02045  03 OF 06  121722Z </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J5, POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, IT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: REVIEW OF ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIF </p><p> </p><p>- INITIAL EUROS 15 MILLION TRANCHE DISTRIBUTED TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF AGENCIES </p><p>- DEPLOYMENT OF FIELD HOSPITAL TO IRAQ MOVING AHEAD </p><p>- COOPERATION WITH UK ON DEPLOYMENT OF BRIGADE-SIZE FORCE </p><p>PLUS CARABINIERI IN BRITISH PHASE IV SECTOR </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT - DEPENDABILITY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PM BERLUSCONI MADE A STRATEGIC CHOICE TO STICK BY THE </p><p>U.S. WHICH HE ABIDED BY AND PERIODICALLY REAFFIRMED.  HE </p><p>COULD HAVE BUCKLED UNDER HEAVY PRESSURE FROM SOME EU BRETHREN </p><p>TO PEEL AWAY FROM THE COALITION.  OTHERS MIGHT HAVE; </p><p>BERLUSCONI DID NOT.  SIGNING THE ORIGINAL LETTER OF THE EIGHT </p><p>WAS A CLEAR AND HELPFUL SIGN TO EU MEMBERS AND CANDIDATE </p><p>STATES OUTSIDE THE FRANCO-GERMAN AXIS THAT IT WAS ACCEPTABLE </p><p>TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED, PUBLICLY.  MOREOVER, STRONG </p><p>COMMENTS BY MINDEF MARTINO AND FM FRATTINI TO EU COLLEAGUES </p><p>AND THE MEDIA ON THE NEED TO ENFORCE UN RESOLUTIONS ON IRAQ\'S </p><p>DISARMAMENT KEPT THE UK AND SPAIN  FROM BEING ISOLATED IN THE </p><p>EU.

WE ASKED </p><p>THE GOI TO OPPOSE EFFORTS TO USE THE UNGA OR OTHER UN FORA TO </p><p>CRITICIZE COALITION ACTION IN IRAQ, AND IT DID.  WE URGED THE </p><p>GOI TO EXPEL IRAQI OFFICIALS SUSPECTED OF INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ACTIVITY IN ITALY AND, WITHIN DAYS OF OUR DEMARCHE, ALL BUT </p><p>ONE OF THOSE ACCREDITED TO ITALY WERE GONE (NOTE: WE HAD LESS </p><p>SUCCESS WITH THE IRAQIS RESIDENT IN ITALY BUT ACCREDITED TO </p><p>THE VATICAN OR THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION.  END </p><p>NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE GOI PROVED TO THE EMBASSY THAT IT KNEW VERY WELL </p><p>HOW TO MANAGE A DELICATE INTERNAL POLITICAL SITUATION -- </p><p>ESPECIALLY PARLIAMENT AND RELATIONS WITH PRESIDENT CIAMPI. </p><p>IN SOME INSTANCES, WE QUESTIONED GOI DECISIONS TO NOTIFY </p><p>PARLIAMENT OF SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL DETAILS.  INDEED, MINDEF </p><p>MARTINO TOLD US THAT HE PROBABLY SET THE BAR TOO LOW AND </p><p>ULTIMATELY HAD TO WALK BACK PARLIAMENT FROM EXPECTING FINE </p><p>GRANULARITY ABOUT ITALY\'S ASSISTANCE EFFORTS.  AS WE HAVE </p><p>SAID PREVIOUSLY ABOUT MARTINO, HE OFTEN TAKES A CIRCUITOUS </p><p>ROUTE IN DEALING WITH CONTROVERSIAL SECURITY ISSUES.  BUT HE </p><p>USUALLY GETS IT RIGHT IN THE END.  THOUGH IT HAD TO </p><p>RECALIBRATE MIDSTREAM, THE GOI WAS ABLE TO RETAIN CRUCIAL </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT THROUGH REGULAR CONSULTATION AND </p><p>INFORMATION SHARING, ALL THE WHILE KEEPING ITS PROMISES TO </p><p>PROTECT OPSEC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PERHAPS EVEN MORE CRITICALLY, THE GOI, WITH OUR HELP, </p><p>KEPT PRESIDENT CIAMPI FROM BLOWING THE CONSTITUTIONAL WHISTLE </p><p>ON ITALIAN ASSISTANCE.  HE NEGOTIATED A COMPLEX PACT WITH THE </p><p>GOI NOT TO INVOLVE ITALY "IN DIRECT ATTACKS ON IRAQ."

THE GOI </p><p>WORKED CLOSELY WITH US ON TACTICS TO ENSURE THAT CIAMPI DID </p><p>NOT CALL INTO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT, RECOMMENDING A LETTER FROM THE AMBASSADOR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT EXPLAINING THE 173RD\'S MISSION THAT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE GOI, HEADED OFF HIS INTERVENTION TO BLOCK IT.  WHILE THE </p><p>GOI WAS RIGHT IN REQUESTING THAT THEY, NOT US, MANAGE THE </p><p>CIAMPI CONUNDRUM, IT REMINDS US FORCEFULLY THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED ON KEY NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS.
