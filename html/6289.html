Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: The Ambassador visited Jaffna, March 11. </p><p>The March 10 sinking of a LTTE arms resupply ship was on </p><p>everyone\'s minds, with the military and Tamils in sharp </p><p>discord on the GSL\'s action.  The military, which was </p><p>highly critical of the LTTE, defended the size of its </p><p>security zones.  Tamils, meanwhile, complained about the </p><p>zones and the lack of economic progress in Jaffna.  One </p><p>sign of hope was the reconstructed Jaffna library.  The </p><p>Ambassador urged both sides to stay the course and </p><p>exercise more patience.  Media coverage of the visit was </p><p>positive.  Overall, Jaffna seemed in a sour, suspicious </p><p>mood.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Visit to Jaffna </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador Wills led a Mission team on a March 11 </p><p>visit to Jaffna.  DAO, PAO, A/RSO, and polchief </p><p>accompanied the Ambassador.  During the one-day visit, </p><p>the Ambassador met with Major General Sarath Fonseka, </p><p>the commander of Sri Lankan military forces in Jaffna, </p><p>at his Palaly airbase office.  In Jaffna city, he had </p><p>lunch with several local representatives of non- </p><p>governmental organizations and held a separate meeting </p><p>with several Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs.  The </p><p>visit wrapped up with a stop at the newly reconstructed </p><p>Jaffna library.  Before departing for Colombo from </p><p>Palaly, the Ambassador met briefly with Fonseka. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Sharp Disagreement over March 10 Incident </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador asked General Fonseka about the </p><p>March 10 sinking of a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) ship off Sri Lanka\'s northeast coast by the Sri </p><p>Lankan navy (see Refs A-B).  Fonseka replied that, based </p><p>on what he had heard, the LTTE ship was a very large one </p><p>and was clearly carrying a large amount of arms, </p><p>although the exact type was not known.  The Ambassador </p><p>noted dryly that it, indeed, appeared as if the ship was </p><p>not carrying "books for the Jaffna library."  It was </p><p>positive, Fonseka noted, that the GSL had decided to </p><p>challenge the LTTE by taking action against the group\'s </p><p>resupply efforts.  Introducing a theme he would keep </p><p>coming back to (see Paras 5-7), Fonseka remarked that </p><p>the incident highlighted why he thought it was so </p><p>difficult to trust the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Tamil politicians had a completely different </p><p>take on the incident.  M. Senathirajah, a TNA </p><p>parliamentarian with close links to the LTTE, was </p><p>particularly vociferous in his denunciation of the </p><p>government\'s action.  Senethirajah said the incident was </p><p>a very, very "serious" one, complaining that the GSL had </p><p>no right to attack a LTTE ship in international waters. </p><p>(Note:  Per Ref B, the ship was intercepted </p><p>approximately 175 nautical miles off the northeast coast </p><p>in international waters, but within Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>exclusive economic zone, "EEZ.")  While underscoring </p><p>that he believed the LTTE wanted the peace process to </p><p>continue despite the incident, Senethirajah averred that </p><p>nothing good could come from the government\'s action. </p><p>(Note:  The Tamil politicians seemed to believe they had </p><p>a relatively good handle on LTTE views re the incident, </p><p>as all of them had just met LTTE officials, including </p><p>chief negotiator Anton Balasingham, during a visit to </p><p>the Tiger-controlled Wanni region earlier in the day.) </p><p>The Ambassador replied that the U.S. certainly hoped </p><p>that the LTTE continued its involvement in the peace </p><p>process.  Arms smuggling by the Tigers was a very </p><p>serious matter, however.  Such activities gave rise to </p><p>very, very serious doubts about the group\'s commitment </p><p>to peace, the Ambassador said. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Military Hits out at LTTE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Asked about the overall situation in Jaffna, </p><p>General Fonseka expressed deep concerns about the </p><p>pattern of LTTE activities.  The group continued to </p><p>recruit, and to harass and intimidate Tamils that did </p><p>not agree with it.  On multiple occasions, for example, </p><p>the Tigers had attacked the Jaffna offices and personnel </p><p>of the Eelam People\'s Democratic Party (EPDP), an anti- </p><p>LTTE grouping.  For Tamils, the situation was very tense </p><p>and, according to General Fonseka, "worse than before </p><p>the ceasefire" because they had "to bow" to LTTE </p><p>pressure and could not exercise their political rights. </p><p>The LTTE\'s local political cadre were also very active </p><p>in instigating marches and demonstrations against the </p><p>GSL and the military.  In one current case, for example, </p><p>the Minister of Education was visiting Jaffna and the </p><p>Tigers had launched a "black armband" campaign among </p><p>students protesting his presence.  Soldiers were also </p><p>sometimes spat at, or harassed by motorcycle drivers, </p><p>who drove around them in circles, revving their engines, </p><p>trying to incite an incident. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Summing up, Fonseka said the military was doing </p><p>its best to keep its cool in the face of LTTE </p><p>provocations.  It was really quite difficult to deal </p><p>with the group and to believe simultaneously that it was </p><p>totally sincere about the peace process, he commented. </p><p>While taking note of the difficult circumstances the </p><p>military found itself in, the Ambassador stressed that </p><p>it was important for the sake of the peace process that </p><p>the military continue to exercise restraint to the full </p><p>extent possible. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In response to a question, Fonseka commented </p><p>that he and his officers met at times with the LTTE\'s </p><p>high-level officials in Jaffna.  In general, contacts at </p><p>this level, including with Jaffna political chief </p><p>Ilamparuthi, were relatively cordial.  It was at the </p><p>lower levels that contacts were difficult.  Many of the </p><p>LTTE\'s political cadre in Jaffna were hard-liners, who </p><p>made clear they did not want the military to remain on </p><p>the peninsula.  These cadre made the situation </p><p>especially tense.  Fonseka went on to discount reports </p><p>of a split between Jaffna and eastern LTTE cadre, </p><p>asserting that the group was essentially entirely loyal </p><p>to LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran.  (Note:  DATT will report </p><p>further on Fonseka\'s comments re the LTTE and the </p><p>military situation in Jaffna.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Not surprisingly, most Tamil interlocutors </p><p>perceived the LTTE in a different light.  The Tamil </p><p>politicians, in particular, defended the LTTE and its </p><p>activities, often harking back to decades old incidents </p><p>to justify Tamil anger toward the south.  Most NGO </p><p>representatives also defended the LTTE, though in less </p><p>stentorian tones.  That said, in a private conversation </p><p>with A/RSO, two Tamil NGO representatives, S. Nicoline </p><p>of CARE and Saroja Sivachandran of the Center for </p><p>Women\'s Development, complained about the LTTE, </p><p>asserting that the GSL had "lost control" of the group </p><p>and was allowing it to run rampant in the peninsula. </p><p>The two women also asserted that the group\'s taxation of </p><p>goods and commerce was helping to smother the Jaffna </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Disagreement over Security Zones </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) When asked about the long-standing controversy </p><p>over the "high security zones" in Jaffna, Fonseka </p><p>underscored that the military needed the zones to defend </p><p>itself properly.  (Note:  The security zones comprise </p><p>about 18 percent of the Jaffna peninsula.  The LTTE and </p><p>many Tamils have been agitating for their reduction in </p><p>size.)  Fonseka pointed to the pattern of Tiger </p><p>activities he had reviewed earlier as proof that the </p><p>LTTE simply could not be trusted.  Surprisingly, Fonseka </p><p>did not see the zones as crucial to defending his forces </p><p>by giving them in-depth protection from Tamil Tiger </p><p>long-range artillery attack.  Instead, he felt that the </p><p>zones were crucial in providing his forces protection </p><p>from large-scale LTTE infiltration of the military\'s </p><p>positions.  In stating this, Fonseka stressed that the </p><p>army did not have sensors, night vision or other </p><p>equipment, as the U.S. military used.  Given this </p><p>situation, the army was reliant on old-fashioned, </p><p>strategically placed pickets and guard posts for its </p><p>defense. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) With Tamil interlocutors, the size of the </p><p>security zones was clearly a serious bone of contention, </p><p>but none urged that the miltary completely withdraw from </p><p>the peninsula.  NGO representatives underlined that </p><p>Tamils were reliant on cash crops, such as onions and </p><p>tobacco, for their livelihoods.  The security zones, </p><p>however, were preventing displaced persons from </p><p>resettling their "golden lands" inside the security </p><p>zones.  This was preventing them from growing the crops </p><p>that would fuel the income generation that was so badly </p><p>needed.  (Note:  In response to this point, Fonseka </p><p>commented that he thought Tamils vastly overplayed the </p><p>importance of the land in the security zones.  There was </p><p>some good land, but not that much of it, and the fact </p><p>that it was fallow was not the main source of Jaffna\'s </p><p>economic problems.)  Tamils also stressed their concerns </p><p>that the government was doing little by way of economic </p><p>development in Jaffna.  While electricity had been </p><p>recently restored to part of the peninsula, not much </p><p>else had been done.  In addition, restrictions on </p><p>fishing still remained in place.  (Note:  Queried about </p><p>the complaints about continued restrictions on fishing, </p><p>Fonseka responded that the military had done its best to </p><p>comply with the terms of the February ceasefire accord </p><p>in this area.  Despite all of the complaints, Fonseka </p><p>asserted that Tamil fishermen were not fully taking </p><p>advantage of the relaxation in restrictions.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The Ambassador told Tamil interlocutors that he </p><p>sympathized with the lot of their community and realized </p><p>that much more had to be done.  Patience was crucially </p><p>important, however.  The government was trying to </p><p>improve conditions and knew it was not doing a perfect </p><p>job.  The U.S. and others in the international community </p><p>were committed to trying to help, and would be meeting </p><p>in Tokyo in June on development plans.  In sum, it would </p><p>take time, but the situation would improve.  In the </p><p>meantime, it was important to stay the course and </p><p>support the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) In addition, while emphasizing that the U.S. </p><p>was not directly involved in the negotiations, the </p><p>Ambassador suggested that it might be possible to do </p><p>something about the security zones if the Tigers took </p><p>some sort of confidence-building step.  The group could, </p><p>for example, announce that it was committed to ending </p><p>violence, or that it was disbanding its "Black Tiger" </p><p>suicide squads, or that it was willing to turn over its </p><p>long-range artillery to independent monitors.   If the </p><p>Tigers took any of these steps, the GSL might take that </p><p>as a sign that the zones could be reduced in size as a </p><p>matter of reciprocity.  In response, none of the Tamil </p><p>politicians took the bait, preferring to continue to </p><p>defend the LTTE and criticize the government. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Jaffna Library:  One Sign of Hope </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>13.  (C) Amid all the mutual recriminations and </p><p>distrust, one sign of hope in Jaffna was the newly </p><p>reconstructed Jaffna library.  Totally destroyed in </p><p>fighting in the 1980s, the library has long been an </p><p>important cultural symbol for Tamils.  The government, </p><p>determined to make a gesture of reconciliation, has </p><p>funded reconstruction efforts at the site for the past </p><p>several years.  The Ambassador was given a tour of the </p><p>facility, which -- smelling of paint and lacquer -- was </p><p>close to complete, with bookshelves being hauled in and </p><p>floors being polished.  The Ambassador also visited the </p><p>library\'s spanking new computer room, which had been </p><p>funded by UNESCO.  When asked about the recent </p><p>controversy over the issue, the head of the library was </p><p>not certain when the formal reopening ceremony would </p><p>take place.  (Note:  In February, the LTTE forced the </p><p>Jaffna municipal council to postpone the planned </p><p>reopening of the library.  The LTTE\'s overt rationale </p><p>was that the library was not yet 100 percent finished. </p><p>It is believed, however, that the group stopped the </p><p>opening ceremony because it did not want anyone to draw </p><p>attention to signs of government-Tamil amity at this </p><p>time.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Media Coverage </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) The Ambassador\'s visit received modest, but </p><p>positive coverage in the English and Sinhala dailies on </p><p>March 12.  Coverage in the Tamil dailies was massive, </p><p>but equally positive.  The Ambassador\'s call for support </p><p>for the peace process and patience resonated in both the </p><p>English and vernacular press. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Jaffna\'s recent history has been very troubled. </p><p>As happens in places that are truly desperate, initial </p><p>moves toward peace and seeming normality were greeted in </p><p>Jaffna with something just short of euphoria. </p><p>Unfortunately, but inevitably, that sense of euphoria is </p><p>dying off.  Compared with recent visits (see Ref C, for </p><p>example), Jaffna seemed to be in a sour, suspicious </p><p>mood, with the military and Tamils sharply at odds.  In </p><p>particular, the issue of what to do about the security </p><p>zones continues to bedevil the situation, with both </p><p>sides not sure how to move forward toward resolution on </p><p>that core issue.  Moreover, based on what Mission saw </p><p>and heard, precious little of any sort of economic </p><p>"peace dividend" has been lavished on Jaffna.  The </p><p>region remains poor and marginalized, especially when </p><p>compared to the wealth of Colombo, and there is a lot of </p><p>frustration (and envy) among Tamils over that fact. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Hanging over the whole situation is the </p><p>question of the Tamil Tigers.  The LTTE is clearly </p><p>calling a lot of shots in Jaffna\'s Tamil community at </p><p>this point and, based on what we heard, its grip is not </p><p>a relaxed one.  In our estimation, the situation at rock </p><p>bottom cannot really improve in Jaffna until the LTTE </p><p>wants it to.  While the group has had opportunities to </p><p>change its brutal image, it seems intent on proving once </p><p>again that it does not have the true interests of the </p><p>Tamil community at heart.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
