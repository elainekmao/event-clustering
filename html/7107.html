BERRY, REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy is closed April 4 for the Jordanian </p><p>weekend.  It will reopen for regular business on Sunday, </p><p>April 6.  The movement of American staff remains restricted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) See information about AMCIT reporter in para 9 below. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The official Petra news service reported that King </p><p>Abdullah and Egyptian President Mubarak discussed the </p><p>regional situation in a telephone call April 3.  According to </p><p>the Petra account the two leaders "underlined the importance </p><p>of searching for all means to stop the war as quickly as </p><p>possible.  They also warned against the effects of this war </p><p>on the innocent Iraqi civilians." (ref A) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Government-affiliated Arabic daily Al-Rai gave </p><p>extensive coverage in its April 3 edition to remarks made by </p><p>PM Ali Abul Ragheb in an April 2 meeting with members of the </p><p>Jordanian Senate and several ministers (ref B).  Stressing a </p><p>message of national unity, Abul Ragheb stated that the </p><p>current situation in the region "prompts us more than any </p><p>time in the past to preserve the cohesion of our internal </p><p>front.  Also, we must not allow any side to exploit these </p><p>circumstances to practice oneupsmanship or cast doubt in our </p><p>national and Pan-Arab stands." Rebutting recent criticisms of </p><p>GOJ positions vis-a-vis Iraq, Abul Ragheb said "we welcome </p><p>suggestions and ideas and advice, but oneupsmanship must not </p><p>be practiced at the expense of the country.  We were accused </p><p>of allowing U.S. troops to be stationed in Jordan to </p><p>participate in the war against Iraq and this is absolutely </p><p>untrue." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In the same press account of the meeting, the </p><p>President of the Jordanian Senate, Zaid al-Rifai, echoed the </p><p>PM\'s remarks stating "all of us highly commend His Majesty </p><p>King Abdullah II\'s stands and appreciate the arduous efforts </p><p>he made to prevent the war and his current intensive efforts </p><p>to stop it . . . It is our joint responsibility to preserve </p><p>the Kingdom and its security and stability under the </p><p>leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Nothing new to report -- we will report on likely </p><p>weekend demonstrations in subsequent sitrep. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:04/04/2013 </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  A crew from ABC Television planned to cross the </p><p>Jordan-Iraq border on the morning of April 4, but apparently </p><p>changed their minds after appraising the situation from the </p><p>border.  Also on April 4, a four vehicle convoy consisting of </p><p>foreign correspondents from CBS, London Times, Sky News, </p><p>Portuguese TV, the Toronto Star, as well as two French </p><p>freelancers and two South African journalists planned to </p><p>enter Iraq via Jordan.  A second vehicle convoy of two to </p><p>three vehicles from France\'s Channel two also reportedly </p><p>departed Amman for the Iraqi border.  There are no AMCITS in </p><p>either convoy. </p><p>10. (C) On April 4, local media reported the April 3 meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Gnehm and PM Abul Ragheb (ref C), with the </p><p>Jordan Times calling it a "summons" in their headline.  The </p><p>media drew largely from the Petra News Agency story.  The JT </p><p>quoted the Ambassador, "we have differences of opinion from </p><p>time to time, at the same time, we have some common views of </p><p>things, and one of them is government of Jordan\'s desire to </p><p>be very active and very much involved in the humanitarian </p><p>effort for the Iraqi people."  Editorials surmised that the </p><p>King\'s interview, followed by the PM\'s summons to the </p><p>Ambassador, now makes clear the GOJ\'s position of solidarity </p><p>with the Iraqi people.  The local media also reported April 4 </p><p>the King\'s telephone conversation with Mubarak (para 3). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Al Destour led with a story on "27 Iraqi civilians </p><p>killed and 193 wounded in airstrike," and ran a front-page </p><p>picture of a young boy who had lost his arms.  Al-Rai </p><p>reported Defense Secretary Rumsfeld\'s "latest warning" to </p><p>Syria, and reported the Iraqi regime\'s "denial" of the </p><p>coalition forces approach to Baghdad. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
