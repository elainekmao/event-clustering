<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/UBI, EB/ESC FOR DAS BORG AND J. EIGHMIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ETTC, IR, JA, NL, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ILSA - READOUT FROM AMBASSADOR\'S JULY 2 MEETING </p><p>WITH ROYAL DUTCH (SHELL) PRESIDENT JEROEN VAN DER VEER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 180247 </p><p> </p><p>     B. EIGHMIE-GREEN EMAIL 6/26 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Cliffor M. Sobel for reasons a.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On July 2 the Ambassador met with Jeroen van der </p><p>Veer, President of the Dutch side of Royal Dutch Shell, to </p><p>deliver demarche ref A regarding the Azadegan oil fields in </p><p>Iran.  Van der Veer was accompanied by Senior Regional </p><p>Adviser Dr. Gavin Graham, who recently met with EB/ESC </p><p>officials in Washington on June 25 (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Graham confirmed that Shell had urged the Japanese </p><p>consortium to seek an extension of the MOU, arguing that </p><p>politically this was not good time to be signing agreements. </p><p>Graham noted that he found that the Japanese did not fully </p><p>understand the potential international repercussions of a </p><p>deal with Iran.  "They did not appreciate the seriousness of </p><p>the situation."  However, commercial negotiations between </p><p>Iran and the Japanese were "far from resolved," and this was </p><p>likely also a factor in the Japanese decision to suspend for </p><p>now.  Graham said he did not expect the commercial </p><p>negotiations to be completed soon.  He noted that the June 30 </p><p>deadline had passed without comment by Iran, perhaps showing </p><p>a willingness not to force the issue. </p><p> </p><p>Shell\'s Role </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Shell does not have daily contact with the Japanese, </p><p>and to date has provided only advice on the logistical </p><p>aspects of the plan, not technology itself.  Graham said the </p><p>Japanese group initially approached Shell due to the </p><p>company\'s experience in "heavy" oil, good record of </p><p>cooperation with Japanese firms, and the fact Shell is a </p><p>major supplier to Japan.  Shell has no formal role in the </p><p>Japanese proposal nor in discussions between Iran and the </p><p>Japanese.  However, Graham confirmed that it if the Japanese </p><p>reached agreement with Iran, Shell would consider </p><p>involvement, first looking at the commercial feasibility of </p><p>the agreement:  "We are a commercial company, after all".  If </p><p>the pact was deemed to be commercially viable for Shell, it </p><p>would then consider the political implications. Shell </p><p>reiterated that its policy is to keep the USG informed of its </p><p>actions, and that it follows a credo of "no surprises." </p><p>Graham surmised that other companies would be willing to step </p><p>in based on Shell\'s analysis. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Graham said Shell is looking at Iran today for its </p><p>prospects 5 years down the road as a major player in oil and </p><p>gas.  Japan has similar long term interests:  it is dependent </p><p>on energy imports and Iran is a logical future source due to </p><p>its geography.  The Japanese will likely extend discussions </p><p>with Iran with a view to signing an agreement at a point of </p><p>time when political conditions are better.  One way to remain </p><p>involved while waiting for political conditions to improve </p><p>might be to work on demining activity and on handling </p><p>dangerous environmental problems. </p><p> </p><p>Bangestan Field </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Van der Veer said Shell initially looked positively </p><p>at the Bangestan Field, but now sees environmental and social </p><p>challenges, so they have dropped it from consideration. </p><p>Furthermore, the terms offered by the Iranians were not good. </p><p> Shell has closed its study group. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador complemented Shell on its </p><p>transparency, underlined the importance of the issue to the </p><p>USG, and thanked them for their willingness to engage in </p><p>frank dialogue. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
