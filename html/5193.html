Per reftel request, Post provides the following </p><p>information on the regulation of services in Honduras by sub- </p><p>central government entities. </p><p> </p><p>2.  There is little regulation of services in Honduras by </p><p>sub-central entities.  Services are primarily regulated per </p><p>laws issued in the National Congress.  The Law of Public </p><p>Administration gives the Executive Branch, including </p><p>ministries and other central government entities (state- </p><p>owned telephone and electricity companies), the right to </p><p>issue implementing regulations governing particular public </p><p>services.  CONATEL, the government\'s telecommunications </p><p>regulator, also has the authority to pass regulations for </p><p>the telecom sector. </p><p> </p><p>3.  There are 199 municipalities in Honduras.  The Law of </p><p>Municipalities gives municipal authorities the right to fix </p><p>prices and requirements for construction permits, water </p><p>rates, trash removal and operating licenses for markets, </p><p>restaurants, bars and other establishments.  In an effort to </p><p>promote further decentralization and improve services in the </p><p>health and education sectors, the GOH has proposed passing </p><p>the management and care of some schools and hospitals in </p><p>selected areas to municipalities and community groups. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The law governing the creation of professional </p><p>organizations gives these bodies the right to establish fees </p><p>for services rendered in their profession.  There are at </p><p>least ten bodies for licensed professionals in Honduras, </p><p>including for the engineering, architectural, accounting, </p><p>legal, medical and nursing professions, among others. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
