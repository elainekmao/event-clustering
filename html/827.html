<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 WINDHOEK 001695 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/RA, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, KWMN, SADC, WA </p><p>SUBJECT: STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION: </p><p>NAMIBIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 112270 </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS POSED </p><p>REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WOMEN AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION IS VERY PROGRESSIVE </p><p>IN GUARANTEEING FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS TO ALL </p><p>CITIZENS.  IN ADDITIONAL TO GENERAL GUARANTEES OF </p><p>LIFE, LIBERTY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND </p><p>FREEDOM FROM DISCRIMINATION, ARTICLE 23 SUBSECTION </p><p>(3) DEALING WITH APARTHEID AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, </p><p>MAKES SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO PROMOTE </p><p>GENDER EQUALITY AND STATES, "IT SHALL BE </p><p>PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE REGARD TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN </p><p>IN NAMIBIA HAVE TRADITIONALLY SUFFERED SPECIAL </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED </p><p>AND ENABLED TO PLAY A FULL, EQUAL AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND </p><p>CULTURAL LIFE OF THE NATION." </p><p> </p><p>3.

WHILE THE ACT </p><p>ELIMINATES DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN CIVIL </p><p>MARRIAGES, WOMEN MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW ARE </p><p>OFTEN SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATION.  ALL TOO </p><p>FREQUENTLY, WHEN CUSTOMARY PRACTICES ARE IN </p><p>CONFLICT WITN MODERN STATUTES, CUSTOMARY PRACTICES </p><p>PREVAIL, PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AREAS.  AT A </p><p>RECENT NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADITIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MADE IT CLEAR </p><p>THAT CUSTOMARY LAWS WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION OR MODERN </p><p>STATUTES WOULD BE INVALID.  HOWEVER, PRACTICES IN </p><p>THE RURAL AREAS ARE SLOW TO CHANGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>IT IS COMMON FOR A WOMAN MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY </p><p>LAW TO HAVE HER HOUSE AND POSSESSIONS SEIZED BY </p><p>HER HUSBAND\'S FAMILY IF THE HUSBAND PASSES AWAY. </p><p>OFTEN THE WOMEN IS THROWN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND </p><p>LEFT TO FEND FOR HERSELF.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>CONDEMNED THIS PRACTICE, BUT IT STILL CONTINUES. </p><p>WOMEN ACTIVISTS AND SOCIAL RESEARCHERS IN NAMIBIA, </p><p>ENCOURAGED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE MARRIED PERSON\'S </p><p>EQUALITY ACT, ARE NOW LOOKING AT WAYS OF ATTACKING </p><p>THE PROBLEM OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN </p><p>MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>BEIJING PLAN OF ACTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>4.
