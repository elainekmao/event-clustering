THE SYRIANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY USED THE </p><p>ADP TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS, MOST </p><p>OF WHOM ARE ARAFAT SUPPORTERS, AND MANY OF WHOM ARE </p><p>FORMER FATAH MEMBERS WHO JOINED TAWHID WHEN ARAFAT WAS </p><p>FORCED OUT OF TRIPOLI.  THE SYRIANS ARE APPARENTLY </p><p>CONTENT AT THIS POINT TO LET THE CONFLICT SIMMER WHILE </p><p>WORKING TO AVOID AN OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE WHICH THEY </p><p>COULD NOT CONTROL.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
