(SBU)  Citibank Jordan General Manager Suhair Al-Ali </p><p>told ECON/C July 1 that Citigroup had scheduled a July 13 </p><p>presentation to Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb on the </p><p>proposed use in Jordan of OPIC\'s new "Non-Honoring of </p><p>Sovereign Guarantee Insurance" facility.  She hoped that </p><p>an OPIC official would be available to participate in the </p><p>presentation and to answer questions from the PM, Finance </p><p>Minister Marto, Planning Minister Awadallah and others </p><p>about how it would work. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Al-Ali also said she would forward to the </p><p>Embassy a copy of a draft agreement between Citigroup and </p><p>Jordan covering the use of the facility.  Embassy will </p><p>forward this to Washington by email when received.  Al- </p><p>Ali said that the GOJ was keen to take advantage of the </p><p>program and that the Finance Minister\'s earlier </p><p>objections to taking on new sovereign debt had been </p><p>resolved.  She thought one of the first borrowings would </p><p>be for the Bechtel-managed Aqaba Development Corporation, </p><p>which is responsible for the strategic development of </p><p>Aqaba as an industrial, tourism and transportation hub on </p><p>the Red Sea. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Following the Iraq war, recent </p><p>progress on Israeli-Palestinian track, and the success of </p><p>the World Economic Forum meetings in Jordan, there </p><p>appears to be a resurgence of interest in investing in </p><p>Jordan.  Al-Ali said she wanted to assure OPIC that </p><p>Citigroup is very serious about moving forward with this </p><p>initiative.  She felt that OPIC participation in the </p><p>presentation would be very helpful.  Post is highly </p><p>supportive of OPIC\'s engagement in Jordan and would be </p><p>pleased to support an OPIC visitor for this purpose. </p><p> </p><p>4.
