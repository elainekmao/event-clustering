<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002743 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/17/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KDEM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DISCUSSION OF IFES EXPULSION WITH MFA </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) HARARE 2710  B) HARARE 2690 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ROBERT WHITEHEAD.  REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) IN A SEPTEMBER 17 MEETING WITH MFA DIVISION DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS JONATHAN WUTAWUNASHE, CHARGE ROTH RAISED </p><p>U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXPULSION OF THE TEAM FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (IFES -- REF B), AND </p><p>PROVIDED A COPY OF THE EMBASSY\'S SEPTEMBER 13 DIPLOMATIC NOTE ON </p><p>THIS MATTER.   THE CHARGE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p>IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND ASKED FOR A CLEARER SENSE OF THE GOZ\'S </p><p>POSITION ON WHETHER INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WOULD BE PERMITTED IN </p><p>THE RUN-UP TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WUTAWUNASHE REPLIED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST HE HAD HEARD </p><p>OF THE MATTER; HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN A COPY OF OUR DIPLOMATIC </p><p>NOTE.  TOLD THAT THE TEAM HAD NOT NOTIFIED THE GOZ PRIOR TO ITS </p><p>VISIT, WUTAWUNASHE SAID THAT WAS LIKELY THE CORE OF THEIR </p><p>DIFFICULTIES.  ELECTION OBSERVERS, HE INSISTED, SHOULD BE INVITED </p><p>INTO ZIMBABWE, NOT "FOIST THEMSELVES" ONTO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. </p><p>WUTAWUNASHE SAID ZIMBABWE HAS ALWAYS HELD ELECTIONS "ON TIME."  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE ZIMBABWE HAD EXPERIENCED ELECTION-RELATED </p><p>PROBLEMS SUCH AS VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE PERPETRATORS.  THE "OTHER </p><p>GUYS," HE INSISTED, "ARE NOT HELPLESS."  THAT, ROTH RESPONDED, IS </p><p>WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE CREDIBLE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS HERE, </p><p>SO THAT THEY CAN DOCUMENT PROBLEMS AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THERE IS A CERTAIN "PSYCHOLOGY" AND "PARANOIA" PREVAILING </p><p>WITHIN THE GOZ, WUTAWUNASHE REPLIED, THAT LEADS MANY OFFICIALS TO </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN "CONFERENCES" IN </p><p>FOREIGN CAPITALS CALLING FOR MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE AND THE PRESSURE </p><p>FROM GROUPS WANTING TO MONITOR THE ELECTIONS.  THERE IS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02743  181640Z </p><p>PERCEPTION AMONG MANY, WUTAWUNASHE POINTED OUT, THAT THE MDC WAS </p><p>NOT FORMED IN ZIMBABWE BUT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THAT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S ACTIVITIES ARE NOT "HOME-GROWN."  THE CHARGE SAID HE </p><p>WAS AWARE OF THAT PERCEPTION.  THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES WANTS </p><p>TO FOLLOW ZIMBABWE\'S RULES AND WHY WE WERE SEEKING CLARIFICATION </p><p>ON HOW TO PROCEED.  WUTAWUNASHE RESPONDED ONLY THAT "A LITTLE BIT </p><p>OF PATIENCE ON THE PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD BE A </p><p>GOOD THING." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IT WAS APPARENT THAT WUTAWUNASHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>PROVIDING CLARIFICATION ON THE GROUND RULES FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS.  HIS DESCRIPTION OF PARANOIA WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND RULING PARTY, HOWEVER, IS SPOT ON.  WE ARE BECOMING </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT THE GOZ WILL USE PROCEDURAL AND OTHER </p><p>ROADBLOCKS TO PREVENT VISITS BY OBSERVER MISSIONS WHOSE </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MIGHT NOT BE FAVORABLE, </p><p>LIKELY UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION ITSELF.  SEVERAL DAYS AFTER </p><p>IFES\'S EXPULSION, A SIMILAR -- BUT MUCH LARGER -- EU TEAM </p><p>SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE ON SEPTEMBER 23 WAS TOLD IT COULD NOT COME </p><p>UNTIL IT HAD RECEIVED AN INVITATION FROM THE GOZ (SEPTEL).  THE </p><p>GOZ, NOT SURPRISINGLY, DECLINED TO PROVIDE ANY DETAILS ON WHEN </p><p>SUCH AN INVITATION MIGHT BE FORTHCOMING. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
