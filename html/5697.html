<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000343 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:02/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA\'S OBASANJO ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) FBIS 131123Z FEB 03 </p><p>  (B) FBIS 121434Z FEB 03 </p><p>  (C) Harare 322 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nigerian President Obasanjo February 14 told </p><p>DAS Bridgewater and Ambassador Jeter that Tsanvirgai had made </p><p>a mistake by going to court.  Dialogue was not possible under </p><p>the circumstances, and it made no sense to continue sanctions, </p><p>still less since Australia had implemented additional measures </p><p>outside those established by the Commonwealth.  Obasanjo urged </p><p>the US and UK to be patient and supportive; Africans would </p><p>produce the desired results, though perhaps not on the West\'s </p><p>schedule.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO RECOMMENDS AN END TO SUSPENSION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In response to visiting AF DAS Bridgewater\'s query, </p><p>Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo February 14 confirmed </p><p>that he had recommended and end to Zimbabwe\'s suspension from </p><p>the Commonwealth in a letter to Australian Prime Minister </p><p>Howard and South African President Mbeki.  DAS Bridgewater </p><p>replied that the USG urged him to reconsider that position. </p><p>"Why?" Obasanjo asked.  Because there needs to be dialogue </p><p>between the GOZ and the opposition first, DAS Bridgewater </p><p>answered.  With what opposition? Obasanjo wanted to know. </p><p>Primarily the MDC, DAS Bridgewater responded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Obasanjo contended that Tsvangirai and the MDC had </p><p>precluded dialogue by going to court.  Obasanjo said he had </p><p>counseled Tsvangirai against such a step: "We have a saying </p><p>here; when you are in court, you cannot be friends."  If your </p><p>case is in court, you cannot have dialogue.  The MDC argued </p><p>that it had to file suit within a limited period of time or </p><p>lose the right to contest the election and that it had been </p><p>urged to pursue legal redress if it wanted to contest the </p><p>results, Obasanjo continued.  Therefore, the MDC had gone to </p><p>court despite its early rejection of that course of action. </p><p>Now, the case had been in court for over a year, with no </p><p>progress.  "I told [Tsvangirai] that his case could be in </p><p>court for five years and nothing would happen."  Obasanjo </p><p>remarked that he and Mbeki also objected to the Australian </p><p>decision to implement sanctions that went beyond those </p><p>prescribed by the Commonwealth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LET US SOLVE IT THE AFRICAN WAY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Acknowledging the Nigerian efforts, DAS Bridgewater </p><p>said the USG would continue to provide humanitarian relief. </p><p>Obasanjo cut in, "We should press for realistic things.  I </p><p>have always pleaded, as I did with Cote d\'Ivoire, to let us </p><p>[Africans] take care of it.  You should stand behind and give </p><p>us support."  Obasanjo went on to describe steps ECOWAS had </p><p>taken toward resolving the conflict and hinting that some of </p><p>the false starts and stumbling blocks resulted from the well- </p><p>meaning but ill-advised proposals of non-Africans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Returning to Zimbabwe and the MDC\'s court case, </p><p>Obasanjo rhetorically asked what he should do.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter wondered what Tsvangirai\'s response to the implicit </p><p>advice to drop the court challenge had been.  "He seemed </p><p>confused," Obasanjo replied.  "he wanted to keep his options </p><p>open." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Obasanjo rhetorically moved northward, saying that the </p><p>key to the success of Kenya\'s elections was that Africans had </p><p>convinced arap Moi that he really had to give up power.  "That </p><p>is what we must try with Mugabe."  Obasanjo said he had told </p><p>the Zimbabwean that he (Obasanjo), though younger than Mugabe, </p><p>was already making plans for succession.  Mugabe should do the </p><p>same thing.  "I broached it with him, and he said, \'Oh, that </p><p>is difficult.\'"  Had he even thought about it, wondered DAS </p><p>Bridgewater.  "No, he had not," Obasanjo replied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) "I think the British influence has been negative on </p><p>this issue," Obasanjo offered, arguing that HMG wanted too </p><p>much, too fast.  African leaders should have time to work on </p><p>Mugabe, to convince him to give up power without feeling </p><p>pressured to do so.  "It may not be at your speed, Obasanjo </p><p>concluded, but we\'ll get there." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Zimbabwean opposition reaction (refs A&B) to the </p><p>letter was swift, denunciatory and vigorous.  The domestic </p><p>profile of this issue is lower, and also lower now than it was </p><p>six months or a year ago.  For this part, Obasanjo has become </p><p>more relaxed and confident about addressing it.  A year ago, </p><p>he avoided the Ambassador for nearly six weeks in order to </p><p>preclude a discussion on Zimbabwe.  This time, Obasanjo sought </p><p>out Ambassador Jeter to give him a heads-up; the Ambassador, </p><p>however, was in Katsina at the time and could not return to </p><p>Abuja in time for the requested appointment.  While the USG </p><p>and the GON are unlikely to see eye-to-eye on Zimbabwe, the </p><p>way to genuine dialogue is open, and with it the possibility </p><p>to influence Obasanjo positively.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Ambassador Bridgewater cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
