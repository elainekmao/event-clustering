SUMMARY. REACTION TO OMB ADMINISTRATOR JOHN GRAHAM\'S </p><p>MESSAGE ON REGULATORY REFORM IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE RANGED </p><p>FROM A LIVELY GIVE-AND-TAKE AMONG SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS, </p><p>INCLUDING A NOTED EU PARLIAMENTARIAN, TO POLITE CURIOSITY </p><p>AMONG BUSINESS LEADERS.  WHILE BOTH AUDIENCES ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THE UTILITY OF DOING STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF PROPOSED </p><p>REGULATIONS, THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS WHETHER THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION SHOULD MAKE SUCH STUDIES MANDATORY BEFORE ISSUING </p><p>REGULATIONS.  GOI OFFICIALS REPRESENT A POTENTIAL BASE OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE USG AS WE MAKE OUR CASE BEFORE THE COMMISSION </p><p>ON THE EU\'S PLANNED REGULATORY REFORM.  GETTING ITALIAN </p><p>BUSINESSES ENGAGED IN THE ISSUE WILL BE A MORE DIFFICULT </p><p>TASK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. OMB ADMINISTRATOR JOHN GRAHAM CAME TO ROME ON NOVEMBER 13 </p><p>AS PART OF A PUBLIC-AFFAIRS SPONSORED PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDED </p><p>STOPS IN BERLIN, COPENHAGEN, BRUSSELS AND PARIS.  THE EMBASSY </p><p>HOSTED A ROUNDTABLE WITH NOTABLE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, INCLUDING: GIUSEPPE GARGANI, EU PARLIAMENTARIAN </p><p>AND CHAIR OF THE EU PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AFFAIRS </p><p>AND THE INTERNAL MARKET; ALESSANDRO PALANZA, VICE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL, CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES; MADDALENA FILIPPI, JUDICIAL </p><p>ADVISOR TO THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND A MEMBER </p><p>OF THE OECD WORKING GROUP ON REGULATORY REFORM; STEFANO </p><p>RODOTA, PRESIDENT, ITALIAN DATA PRIVACY COMMISSION AND CHAIR </p><p>OF THE EU WORKING GROUP ON DATA PRIVACY; AND CLAUDIO </p><p>TUCCIARELLI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, REFORMS MINISTRY AND ADVISOR </p><p>TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF REGULATORY REFORM.  AN AFTERNOON </p><p>SESSION WAS HOSTED BY CONFINDUSTRIA, ITALY\'S LARGEST </p><p>EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION, WITH INVITED MEMBERS OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05568  01 OF 02  151704Z </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. DURING THE EMBASSY\'S ROUNDTABLE, QUESTIONS FOR GRAHAM </p><p>FOCUSED ON SEVERAL KEY ASPECTS: WHAT TYPE OF COST-BENEFIT </p><p>ANALYSIS IS DONE?  WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF EXPERTISE IN OMB </p><p>AMONG ECONOMISTS, TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS, SOCIAL POLICY </p><p>EXPERTS?  WHAT IS THE METHODOLOGY USED? WHAT IS OMB\'S </p><p>(GRAHAM\'S OFFICE) RELATIONSHIP WITH STATE AND LOCAL </p><p>LEGISLATORS, AUTHORITIES AND REGULATORS? WHAT GUIDELINES ARE </p><p>USED TO DETERMINE WHEN A REGULATION IS NEEDED? WHAT IS OMB\'S </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS </p><p>THE SEC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK? WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS?  WHAT REVIEW, IF ANY, DOES OMB CONDUCT OF </p><p>LEGISLATION PASSED BY CONGRESS THAT IN EFFECT, ARE REGULATORY </p><p>IN NATURE?  GRAHAM HIGHLIGHTED MANY ASPECTS OF U.S. POLICIES </p><p>AND PROCEDURES: COST BENEFIT ANALYSES INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE </p><p>ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION OF FAIRNESS </p><p>AND EQUITY ISSUES; HIS 50-PERSON STAFF REPRESENTS ALL THE </p><p>SOCIAL SCIENCES; GUIDELINES/METHODOLOGY ARE ON OMB\'S WEBPAGE. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT OMB HAS NO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER THE SEC </p><p>AND THE FED, AND CAN ONLY PROVIDE ADVISORY OPINIONS ON DRAFT </p><p>LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. OMB\'S POLICY TO CONDUCT REGULATORY IMPACT STUDIES OF THE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT DRAFT REGULATIONS GENERATED THE GREATEST </p><p>INTEREST. PALANZA OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND JUDICIAL </p><p>ADVISOR FILIPPI SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGED THE DESIRABILITY, IF </p><p>NOT NECESSITY, OF DOING SUCH STUDIES BEFORE REGULATIONS WERE </p><p>ISSUED.  PALANZA ACKNOWLEDGED THE UTILITY OF THE OECD\'S </p><p>WORKING GROUP ON REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY REFORM, AND </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER THE EU COULD ADOPT SIMILAR PROCESSES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05568  01 OF 02  151704Z </p><p>FILIPPI ALSO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN EX-POST-FACTO REVIEW OF </p><p>REGULATIONS ONCE IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE EU\'S PLAN FOR REGULATORY REFORM ALSO PROMPTED A </p><p>GIVE-AND-TAKE DISCUSSION. GRAHAM RAISED THE QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>WHOM IN THE COMMISSION WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR QUALITY </p><p>CONTROL AND PEER REVIEW.  IN RESPONSE, GARGANI NOTED THAT </p><p>EUROPE HAS NO STANDARD FOR REGULATORY IMPACT STUDIES; THERE\'S </p><p>NO UNIVERSAL TRADITION OF DOING SO.  HE EXPRESSED THAT AMONG </p><p>HIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THERE\'S SOME SKEPTICISM THAT SUCH </p><p>STUDIES SHOULD BE DONE; HE SEEMED TO HEDGE HIS PERSONAL </p><p>OPINION.  HE QUESTIONED HOW THE U.S. DEFINES EFFICIENCY AND </p><p>FAIRNESS IN ITS COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES, WHICH GRAHAM HAD </p><p>UNDERSCORED ARE PART OF THE U.S. REVIEW ALONG WITH A PURE </p><p>QUANTITATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS.  GARGANI ALSO NOTED, SUBTLETY, </p><p>THAT COSTS AND EFFICIENCY ARE NOT ALWAYS THE DECIDING FACTORS </p><p>BEHIND REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN CASES OF LEGISLATION </p><p>PASSED BY PARLIAMENTS THAT IN EFFECT, CREATE REGULATIONS. </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THIS IS SOMETIMES THE CASE IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, GRAHAM ARGUED, HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT A REASON TO </p><p>IGNORE REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSES. </p><p> </p><p>6. DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES IN OPINIONS AMONG THE ROUNDTABLE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS, ALL WERE EAGER TO READ THE OFFICIAL U.S. </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE COMMISSION\'S REGULATORY REFORM ACTION PLAN. </p><p>THEY EXPRESSED APPRECIATION OF ACTIVE U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN THIS </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO3787 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05568  02 OF 02  151704Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  FMP-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------09387A  151725Z /38 </p><p>R 151548Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6934 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2957 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, ETRD, EUN, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BETTER REGULATION: OMB ADMINISTRATOR GRAHAM </p><p>PROMPTS LIVELY DEBATE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05568  02 OF 02  151704Z </p><p>7. IN CONTRAST TO THE LIVELY DEBATE OF THE ROUNDTABLE, THE </p><p>SESSION HOSTED BY CONFINDUSTRIA DEMONSTRATED ITALIAN </p><p>BUSINESSES\' MINIMAL ENGAGEMENT IN THE ISSUE OF REGULATORY </p><p>REFORM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE </p><p>ITALIAN CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION, THE PARTICIPANTS </p><p>LISTENED TO GRAHAM WITH POLITE ATTENTION.  IN CONTRAST, THE </p><p>CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING REPRESENTATIVE SPOKE PASSIONATELY AND </p><p>INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT THE RISK OF DISENGAGEMENT, USING THE </p><p>COMMISSION\'S WHITE PAPER ON CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AS AN EXAMPLE. </p><p>GRAHAM ALSO NOTED THE FLAWS IN THIS WHITE PAPER, AND </p><p>QUESTIONED HOW THE COMMISSION COULD IMPOSE THE SAME TOXICITY </p><p>TESTS FOR CHEMICALS THAT COULD PRESENT WIDESPREAD EXPOSURE </p><p>RISK AND THOSE WITH MINIMAL EXPOSURE RISKS. THE CHEMICAL </p><p>MANUFACTURERS\' REPRESENTATIVE UNDERSCORED THE DESIRABILITY OF </p><p>HAVING INPUT FROM THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>ON REGULATORY REFORM ISSUES. IN RESPONSE TO GRAHAM\'S INQUIRY </p><p>ABOUT HOW ITALIAN BUSINESSES LOBBY ON ISSUES IN BRUSSELS, </p><p>PANELISTS ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFICULTY IN BEING EFFECTIVE AND </p><p>IN BEING "LISTENED TO", THEY REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT: POST BELIEVES ADMINISTRATOR GRAHAM\'S VISIT COULD </p><p>HELP GENERATE A MORE IN-DEPTH EXCHANGE WITH GOI OFFICIALS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE HANDS-ON INVOLVEMENT WITH </p><p>REGULATORY REFORM, ON THE COMMISSION\'S PLANS. WE APPRECIATE </p><p>WASHINGTON AND USEU\'S SUPPORT FOR THIS VISIT. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05568 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
