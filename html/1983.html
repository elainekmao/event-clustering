<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 008352 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 9/12/11 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MARR, PTER, PGOV, PREL ,CO </p><p>SUBJECT: OPERATION SEVENTH OF AUGUST WINDS DOWN </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BOGOTA 7805 B) BOGOTA 7555 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY\'S (COLMIL) "SEVENTH OF </p><p>AUGUST" OPERATION, LAUNCHED ON AUGUST 17 AGAINST A </p><p>1,300 STRONG FARC FORCE IN THE EASTERN COLOMBIAN </p><p>DEPARTMENTS OF GUAVIARE AND META IS WINDING DOWN.  THE </p><p>JOINT ARMY/AIR FORCE OPERATION WAS EXTREMELY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL, ESPECIALLY IN ITS EARLY STAGES, AS IT </p><p>INFLICTED SUBSTANTIAL CASUALTIES ON SOME OF THE FARC\'S </p><p>ELITE MOBILE COLUMNS, AND LED TO THE DEATH OF "URIAS </p><p>CUELLAR," THE FARC\'S SECOND MOST IMPORTANT FIELD </p><p>COMMANDER AND HEIR APPARENT TO "MONO JOJOY." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SINCE THE END OF AUGUST, THE COLMIL HAS BEEN </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO ENCIRCLE THE FARC COMBATANTS AS THEY </p><p>RETREAT BACK TO THE FARC "DEMILITARIZED ZONE" </p><p>("DESPEJE").  THIS EFFORT HAS HAD LIMITED RESULTS FOR </p><p>THE COLMIL, WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF FARC COMBATANTS </p><p>SURRENDERING.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THE RETREATING FARC </p><p>COMBATANTS HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN ABLE TO ELUDE THE </p><p>COLMIL\'S ENCIRCLEMENT BY BREAKING UP INTO SMALL GROUPS </p><p>AND USING THE AREA\'S DENSE VEGETATION TO THEIR </p><p>ADVANTAGE.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE LIMITED SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>MOP-UP OPERATION, OPERATION "SEVENTH OF AUGUST" IS THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN MILITARY\'S BIGGEST SUCCESS AGAINST THE FARC </p><p>IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OPERATIONAL RESULTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AS REPORTED REFTELS, ON AUGUST 17, THE COLMIL </p><p>LAUNCHED A MAJOR JOINT ARMY/AIR FORCE OPERATION AIMED </p><p>AT DESTROYING MOBILE FARC UNITS WHICH HAD EARLIER LEFT </p><p>THE FARC "DEMILITARIZED ZONE" TO ATTACK MILITARY </p><p>TARGETS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF META AND GUAVIARE.  THE </p><p>FARC UNITS WERE UNDER DIRECT ORDERS TO RETAKE THE TOWN </p><p>OF BARRANCOMINAS (GUAINIA DEPARTMENT), LOST TO THE </p><p>COLMIL DURING OPERATION "GATO NEGRO."  ESTIMATES ARE </p><p>THAT THE FARC SUFFERED 150 KILLED IN COMBAT, THE </p><p>LARGEST NUMBER OF FARC KILLED IN AN OPERATION IN RECENT </p><p>HISTORY.  FURTHERMORE, INTELLIGENCE SOURCES INDICATE </p><p>THAT APPROXIMATELY 30 FARC COMBATANTS SURRENDERED </p><p>FOLLOWING THE COLMIL\'S INITIAL BATTLEFIELD SUCCESSES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, </p><p>FOLLOWING ITS EARLY BATTLEFIELD SETBACKS, THE FARC </p><p>FORCE WAS ABLE TO SPLIT INTO GROUPS OF 50-300, WHICH </p><p>HAVE LARGELY SUCCEEDED IN RETREATING INTO THE </p><p>SURROUNDING JUNGLE AND WORKING THEIR WAY BACK TO THE </p><p>"DESPEJE."  THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE CONTINUE CONDUCTING </p><p>RECONNAISSANCE AND PURSUIT OPERATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>LOCATE AND DESTROY SOME OF THESE SMALLER GROUPS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL JORGE MORA, HE HAS </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 750 TROOPS IN BLOCKING POSITIONS TO </p><p>INTERCEPT THE FARC COLUMNS SEEKING TO RETURN TO THE </p><p>"DESPEJE."  ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL ENGAGEMENTS LED TO </p><p>HEAVY FARC LOSSES, THE MOP-UP OPERATION HAS SO FAR HAD </p><p>ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS AND WILL NOT LIKELY YIELD THE </p><p>LARGE NUMBER OF FARC DESERTIONS THAT THE MILITARY WAS </p><p>ORIGINALLY PREDICTING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>FARC FIELD MORALE LOW </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE COLMIL\'S SEIZURE OF AT LEAST EIGHT TONS OF </p><p>RATIONS DESTINED FOR THE FARC COMBATANTS, THE FARC\'S </p><p>INABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS GOAL TO RETAKE BARRANCOMINAS </p><p>AND REESTABLISH A MAJOR DRUGS/WEAPONS CENTER ON THE </p><p>BRAZILIAN BORDER, AND THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AIR TO </p><p>GROUND ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE </p><p>HAVE, ACCORDING TO CAPTURED FARC GUERRILLAS, KEPT FARC </p><p>FIELD MORALE VERY LOW.  THE ARMY HAS REPOSITIONED ITS </p><p>TROOPS INTO BLOCKING POSITIONS TO CUT OFF THE FARC\'S </p><p>ROUTES OF RETREAT TO THE "DESPEJE," AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>HOPE TO CAPTURE OR KILL GUERRILLAS AS THEY FLEE THE </p><p>COMBAT ZONE.  THIS MOP-UP PHASE IS EXPECTED TO END IN </p><p>THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THIS OFFENSIVE REFLECTS THE TACTICAL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE COLMIL HAS MADE OVER THE PAST TWO </p><p>YEARS. INTELLIGENCE WAS VITAL TO LOCATING THE FARC </p><p>COLUMN, AND THE COLMIL WAS ABLE TO EXPLOIT THAT </p><p>INTELLIGENCE BY MAKING USE OF ITS VASTLY IMPROVED </p><p>TRANSPORT CAPABILITIES, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE C-130 </p><p>MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY A </p><p>SHORTAGE OF PARTS AND SKILLED MECHANICS.  TWO YEARS </p><p>AGO, EVEN IF INTELLIGENCE HAD PROVIDED THE NECESSARY </p><p>INFORMATION, THE COLMIL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>MOVE OVER 3,000 TROOPS IN 48 HOURS TO THE COMBAT ZONE, </p><p>AND THE FARC WOULD HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY ESCAPED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) AT ONE TIME, THE COLMIL WAS HOPEFUL THAT A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF TRAPPED FARC GUERRILLAS WOULD TURN THEMSELVES </p><p>IN, AS HAD OCCURRED LATE LAST YEAR DURING OPERATION </p><p>BERLIN.  IN THIS CASE, THE DIFFICULT TERRAIN ALLOWED </p><p>MOST OF THE GUERRILLA UNITS TO EVADE CONTACT WITH THE </p><p>MILITARY AND THUS RETURN SAFELY TO THE "DESPEJE." </p><p>ALTHOUGH LARGE SCALE DESERTIONS ARE UNLIKELY, OPERATION </p><p>"SEVENTH OF AUGUST" IS, BY ANY MEASURE, ONE OF THE </p><p>COLMIL\'S BIGGEST MILITARY SUCCESSES IN THE LAST FEW </p><p>YEARS.  THIS OPERATION WILL LIKELY REINFORCE THE TREND </p><p>OF THE FARC REVERTING TO HIT-AND-RUN TACTICS AND </p><p>AVOIDING FRONTAL ENGAGEMENTS WITH NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR </p><p>GROUND TROOPS BACKED BY SUPERIOR FIREPOWER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
