<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001431 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT BRIEFS AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary: Ambassador Jeter paid a courtesy call on </p><p>Secretary to Government for the Federation (SGF) Ufot Ekaette </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>on June 15.  Ekaette described the role of the SGF in </p><p>civilian government as a cross between Chief of Staff and </p><p>"super-Minister."  In a meeting that ranged widely over </p><p>topics of current interest in bilateral relations, the SGF </p><p>proved to have a firm command of the issues.  He offered his </p><p>assistance to the Ambassador if ever USG officials </p><p>encountered difficulty getting a directive from the President </p><p>translated into action by the Ministries, a common problem. </p><p>As proof of his willingness to help, Ekaette concluded the </p><p>meeting by asking to be included in correspondence from the </p><p>Embassy to the Ministries of Aviation and Internal Affairs </p><p>regarding re-deploying INS officials to train airline </p><p>employees and GON officers in identifying and interdicting </p><p>fraudulent documents.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  SGF Ekaette described for the Ambassador the role of </p><p>his office within Nigeria\'s new democratic dispensation. </p><p>Under military rule, the SGF normally acted as Head of the </p><p>civil service, but this function has been separated since the </p><p>return of democracy.  Ekaette said that the SGF sits as </p><p>Secretary on all Executive Councils: Council of State, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Federal Executive Council, and Security Council.  He said </p><p>that all action items produced by Ministries are routed </p><p>through his office, and if he disagrees with them on policy, </p><p>budgetary or administrative grounds, they are sent back for </p><p>reconsideration.  Ekaette added that the President, when </p><p>dissatisfied with solutions proposed by the Council of State, </p><p>will ask the SGF to chair a committee of Ministers to work on </p><p>an alternative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The SGF has six Permanent Secretaries on his staff, </p><p>and is in charge of a number of Ministers of State working </p><p>directly in the President\'s office, including Political, </p><p>Economic and Administrative Affairs.  (Comment: Protocol </p><p>hierarchy is both very sensitive and unsettled within the </p><p>GON: practically speaking, Ministers follow the Speaker of </p><p>the House, after the Senate President and Vice President. </p><p>The SGF appears to hold a practical rank equivalent to that </p><p>of Minister, while appearing to be primus inter pares in </p><p>terms of his influence and co-ordinating role between the </p><p>Presidency and Ministries.  End Comment.)  Ekaette denied </p><p>having a direct supervisory role over the Head of Service or </p><p>Ministers, yet his influence is perhaps indicated by the fact </p><p>that he announced the sacking of several ministers in a </p><p>surprise move last week.  The SGF offered to assist if ever </p><p>there appears to be a "logjam" in getting something </p><p>accomplished through Ministerial channels.  "I break </p><p>through," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The Ambassador asked Ekaette, an indigene of Akwa </p><p>Ibom, his position on Niger Delta issues.  The SGF replied </p><p>that there would likely be a political solution to the </p><p>problem despite the current litigation in the Supreme Court. </p><p>"The President\'s mandate is national--he must balance the </p><p>demands of individual states with the demands of the whole." </p><p>On the state of the Civil Service, Ekaette said he felt the </p><p>GON had adequately dealt with the issue of ghost workers, </p><p>although some may remain.  He estimated the total number of </p><p>GON employees, including the military and police, to be </p><p>247,000.  The SGF was equally conversant in other topics </p><p>raised by the Ambassador, including the Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission, AGOA, and rule of law/sanctity of contract </p><p>issues.  On the latter, the SGF said it was unfortunate to </p><p>unilaterally nullify contracts, but he defended the practice </p><p>when the contracts in question are "fictitious."  He said </p><p>that the current Government inherited a large number of </p><p>contracts which existed only to the extent that the </p><p>"mobilization fee" (roughly 50 percent of the contract\'s </p><p>value) was paid, but no work was ever done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Finally, the Ambassador raised the problems </p><p>surrounding the use of fraudulent documentation by passengers </p><p>on the South African Air/ Nigerian Airways flight from Lagos </p><p>to New York.  Ambassador Jeter described his efforts with </p><p>Kema Chikwe, Minister of Aviation, and Sunday Afolabi, </p><p>Minister of Internal Affairs, to promptly reach agreement </p><p>regarding the return of INS officials to Nigeria to assist in </p><p>training Nigerian and South African airline employees and </p><p>possibly GON officials in identifying fraudulent documents. </p><p>Ekaette asked to be included in the communication regarding </p><p>this issue, and promised to assist, if needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Comment: Ekaette may prove to be a vital link that </p><p>the Mission has lacked in persuading Ministries to translate </p><p>verbal commitments into action.  Where an action requires </p><p>more than the assent of one minister, such as the USD 3.5 </p><p>million dollar payment to MPRI, GON officials seem content to </p><p>kick the ball but never reach the goal line.  As for the </p><p>SGF\'s real influence, after walking us down to the car, </p><p>Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, and impressive Permanent Secretary who was </p><p>recently at the Ministry of Commerce, shook his head and said </p><p>that the SGF was being modest.  "He can make Ministers do </p><p>things."  We will see.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
