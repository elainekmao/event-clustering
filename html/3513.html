<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PGOV, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: LAND REFORM ZIMBABWE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Evict defiant farmers" the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its August 15 </p><p>      editorial to encouraging the government of Zimbabwe to </p><p>      eject all "defiant farmers" from the designated commercial </p><p>      farms under the fast-trek land reform program.  "Terrorists </p><p>      masquerading as farmers must be crushed," the editorial </p><p>      bellowed.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .It is pertinent to warn any farmer that there is </p><p>      no individual, whether they have blue eyes or white skin, </p><p>      who can take the might of the State and win.  In fact no </p><p>      government will tolerate that.  Ours will not be an </p><p>      exception.  That is called terrorism and to quote U. S. </p><p>      President George W. Bush, no resources will be spared to </p><p>      fight terrorists.  Terrorists masquerading as farmers must </p><p>      be crushed. . .If Britain and the U. S. really care about </p><p>      their citizens they should advise them to comply by moving </p><p>      out of the acquired farms peacefully as they face forcible </p><p>      eviction. . .No amount of statements from the U. S. State </p><p>      Department or Britain will change that.  Not even </p><p>      `extending\' the hollow personal sanctions against the </p><p>      government can stop the agrarian revolution. . .In short, </p><p>      to borrow a phrase from Mr. Bush, they must be `flushed </p><p>      out\' before their tails grow longer." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
