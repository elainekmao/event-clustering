<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004490 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/R/MR, EUR/SE, EUR/PD, NEA/PD, DRL </p><p>JCS PASS J-5/CDR S. WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>THURSDAY, JULY 17, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER </p><p>THREE THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEALS </p><p>U.S.: Suleymaniye raid a regrettable, unfortunate </p><p>incident - Hurriyet </p><p>Gul: Rumsfeld letter voices respect for Turkey\'s </p><p>military - Aksam </p><p>Gul to U.S. next week - Milliyet </p><p>U.S. troops in Iraq furious at Bush, Rumsfeld - Vatan </p><p>Chaos prevails in Iraq - Sabah </p><p>Consumers boycott U.S. goods - Hurriyet </p><p>Denktas invites Greeks to Varosha - Turkiye </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPINION MAKERS </p><p>U.S. voices regret over Suleymaniye raid - Radikal </p><p>Iraq swamp pulling Washington down - Radikal </p><p>Wexler slams Rumsfled over Suleymaniye arrests - Yeni </p><p>Safak </p><p>A PKK member in Iraqi interim council - Zaman </p><p>Tehran admits Canadian reporter beaten to death - </p><p>Cumhuriyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rumsfeld letter to Erdogan: In a letter on behalf of </p><p>President Bush to Prime Minister Erdogan, Secretary of </p><p>Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the significance of U.S.- </p><p>Turkish friendship and voiced regret about the </p><p>Suleymaniye detentions, most dailies report.  However, </p><p>some papers interpret the letter was concrete evidence </p><p>that the detentions were carried out with the approval </p><p>of Washington.  The Rumsfeld letter says that the </p><p>Turkish soldiers were detained for arming the Turkomen, </p><p>a clear violation of agreements between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey.  Sources close to the ruling AKP are inclined </p><p>to regard the letter as a message voicing regret over </p><p>the Suleymaniye arrests, an `isolated incident.\' All </p><p>papers agree that the letter fell outside of </p><p>conventional diplomatic practice, and stress that it </p><p>should have been signed either by the President or Vice </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Washington approves fact-finding commission statement: </p><p>Washington approved a statement by the joint fact- </p><p>finding commission probing the detention of Turkish </p><p>troops in Suleymaniye.  The U.S. approval comes 24 </p><p>hours after TGS released the Turkish version of the </p><p>statement.  Papers claim that the U.S. had been upset </p><p>by the TGS decision to release the statement without </p><p>official confirmation from Washington.  U.S. officials </p><p>said the delay was caused by bureaucratic formalities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pro-PKK figure in Iraqi governing council: Dr. Mahmud </p><p>Osman, a member of the Iraqi governing council formed </p><p>by the U.S., is closely linked to the PKK, "Aksam" </p><p>reports.  The paper deems the appointment `surprising,\' </p><p>since the PKK/KADEK is in the U.S. list of terrorist </p><p>organizations.  The U.S. wanted to silence criticism of </p><p>the PKK/KADEK, and to give a message that the new </p><p>administration will include representatives of all </p><p>Kurds in Iraq, "Aksam" speculates.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul said Turkey is investigating Osman\'s alleged ties </p><p>with the PKK, and noted that Ankara would not recognize </p><p>a terrorist in the Iraqi administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palestinian FM in Ankara: Visiting Palestinian Foreign </p><p>Minister Shaath asked for Ankara\'s support in </p><p>convincing Israel to move forward in the Middle East </p><p>peace process.  After meeting with Shaath on Wednesday, </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul said that the reform process in </p><p>Palestine was being discussed, and that Turkey would </p><p>help Palestine to draft a constitution.  Gul also noted </p><p>that Ankara has extended an invitation for an official </p><p>visit by Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Denktas invites Greek Cypriots to Varosha: Turkish </p><p>Cypriot leader Denktas said that if the Greek Cypriot </p><p>government rejects his offer of jointly opening Varosha </p><p>to tourism, the Greek Cypriots would be allowed to </p><p>settle in Varosha.  Denktas reportedly said the </p><p>deserted town of Varosha `cannot remain closed </p><p>forever.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Decline in consumption of U.S. goods: Papers report on </p><p>a survey carried out by Roper ASW, which shows a 13 </p><p>percent decline in consumption of U.S.-made goods in </p><p>Turkey since 1999.  Roper ASW claimed that the Iraq </p><p>crisis has caused consumers worldwide to boycott </p><p>American culture and consumer products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can\'t we be more specific?" </p><p>Sami Kohen stated in mass appeal Milliyet (7/17): </p><p>"Ankara is suffering because of its failure to present </p><p>a clearly defined policy for Northern Iraq.  This issue </p><p>has not been  properly discussed to this point, but </p><p>there is an urgent need for an open discussion and to </p><p>work toward new strategies based on the facts in the </p><p>region.  Northern Iraq has turned into an issue that </p><p>could determine the fate of Turkish-American relations. </p><p>Both Turkey and the US need to fine-tune their policies </p><p>on Iraq if there is a common desire to enhance </p><p>bilateral ties." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq and Turkey" </p><p>Cengiz Candar commented in DB Tercuman (7/17): "Turkey </p><p>has experienced a defeat in Iraq in all military, </p><p>political and diplomatic senses.  Turkey must </p><p>completely change its approach to Iraq, particularly </p><p>its `northern Iraq mentality,\' as quickly and </p><p>thoroughly as possible.  Otherwise, we can expect new </p><p>challenges with the US, new defeats for Ankara, and </p><p>more problems for the Turkoman community." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agreeing to disagree" </p><p>Ilnur Cevik is back from the region and observed in the </p><p>English language Turkish Daily News (7/17): "The </p><p>Americans have decided not to pursue the issue any </p><p>further for the sake of Turkish-American ties, but the </p><p>dispute is still there.  Now Turkish leaders have to </p><p>sit down and decide what we want to do in northern Iraq </p><p>and how.  This means the civilian leadership should be </p><p>more involved in the decision-making process, and </p><p>should not leave everything to the military." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
