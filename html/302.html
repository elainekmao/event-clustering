<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KADUNA 01532 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR KOLKER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR FENDRICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:   PGOV, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  THE DYNAMICS OF PARTISAN POLITICS: </p><p>          SCEPTICAL VIEWS ON IBB\'S POLITICAL UTOPIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) LAGOS 15948  (B) LAGOS 15697 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  DURING A WEEK-LONG TRIP TO BENUE AND GONGOLA </p><p>STATES, CONGEN QUERIED BUSINESSMEN, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>FORMER MINISTERS OF GOVERNMENT, CIVIL SERVANTS, AND </p><p>TRADITIONAL TITLEHOLDERS  ABOUT PRESIDENT IBRAHIM </p><p>BABANGIDA\'S HISTORIC DECISION TO REGISTER TWO POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES OF HIS OWN CREATION.  INTERLOCUTORS AGREED THAT, </p><p>WHILE A DEFT SURPRISE, THE DECISION WAS TOO IDEALISTIC, </p><p>I.E., THE NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURES WILL NEVER BE IMMUNE TO </p><p>THE NIGERIAN ENVIRONMENT OF TRIBAL, ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS AND </p><p>REGIONAL PARTISANSHIP, THE "MONEYBAGS" AND CORRUPTION. </p><p>SEVERAL COMMENTATORS OPINED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW </p><p>SHIFTED HIS VISION TO "GUIDED DEMOCRACY" WITH LONG-TERM </p><p>MILITARY SUPERVISION AND A SUSTAINED THREAT OF </p><p>INTERVENTION.  NOTWITHSTANDING SUCH OPINIONS, ALL WILL </p><p>JOIN ONE OF THE TWO NEW PARTIES AND SOME WILL ACTIVELY </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN PARTY AFFAIRS.  REPRESENTATIVE VIEWS FROM </p><p>FOUR INDIVIDUALS ARE PRESENTED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BENUE STATE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  BANNED POLITICIAN PAUL UNONGO, FORMER MINISTER OF </p><p>MINES, POWER AND STEEL IN THE SHAGARI REGIME AND DEFEATED </p><p>NPP CANDIDATE IN THE 1983 BENUE STATE GUBERNATORIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS, HAS BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS IN BENUE STATE OF THE NOW-DISSOLVED PEOPLES </p><p>SOLIDARITY PARTY (PSP).  UNONGO STATED THAT THERE ARE </p><p>THREE THEORIES ABOUT BABANGIDA\'S DECISION.  THE </p><p>"CONSPIRACY THEORY" ASSERTS THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S INTENTION </p><p>TO REMAIN IN POWER HAS BEEN MANIFESTED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE </p><p>THE 1985 COUP THROUGHSHIS SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION OF </p><p>OPPONENTS.  THE ABOLISHMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES RULING </p><p>COUNCIL (AE) AND ITS RECONSTITUTION AS A SMALLER GROUP </p><p>AND THE FREQUENT REPLACEMENT OF GOVERNORS ARE CITED AS </p><p>RECENT EVIDENCE.  THEORISTS CLAIM THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF TWO NEW PARTIES BEHOLDEN Y TO H M IS HIS LATEST </p><p>MANEUVER. </p><p> </p><p>THE "IDEALIST THEORY" POSITS THE OPPOSITE, THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>BABANGIDA IS SINCERE IN HIS DESIREJ BREAK WITH THE PAST </p><p>AND ESTABLISH A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE THIRD </p><p>REPUBLIC AND THAT HE BELIEVES HE CAN ACHIEVE THIS GOAL </p><p>THROUGH THE TWO NEW PARTIES.  HIS DECISION REFLECTS HIS </p><p>FRUSTRATION WITH BOTH OLD AND NEW BREED POLITICIANS AND </p><p>HIS DESIRE TO LET THE IGERIAOEOPLE DECIDE FOR </p><p>THEMSELVES.  IN SHORT, HE SHOULD BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD. </p><p> </p><p>LASTLY, THE "THEORY OF GUIDED DEMOCRACY" CENTERS ON THE </p><p>BELIEF THAT BABANGIDA WILL REMAIN IN SOME AS YET </p><p>UNSPECIFIED ROLE, OR PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE DRAFTED AS </p><p>PVSIDENT, TO EXERT MILITARY GUIDANCE, REWARDS AND </p><p>PUNISHMENT OVER THE THIRD REPUBLIC.  HE RECOGNIZES THATHD </p><p>IGERIA IS NOT READY FOR FULL DEMOCRACY AND WILL NEED </p><p>"GUIDANCE" FOR AT LEAST TEN TO TWENTY YEARS, SAY THIS </p><p>THEORY\'S PROPONENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNONGO SUBSCRIBES TO THE LATTER THEORY BUT WOULD NOT </p><p>CONJECTURE HOW BABANGIDA WOULD DO IT.  THIS WILL NOT </p><p>PREVENT THE DEFUNCT PSP FROM JOINING EN MASSE THE NEW </p><p>SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP), HE SAID.  THE EX-PEOPLE\'S </p><p>FRONT OF NIGERIA (PFN) WILL DO SO AS WELL BECAUSE THE PSP </p><p>AND PFN WILL STICK TO THEIR PRE-DECISION DEAL, ENGINEERED </p><p>BY HIMSELF AND ALHAJI SHEHU YAR\'ADUA, WHICH SPECIFIED THAT </p><p>THE LOSER AMONG THE TWO WOULD JOIN THE WINNER AFTER </p><p>REGISTRATION.  TOGETHER WITH THE FORMER LIBERAL PARTY (LP) </p><p>THE NEW SDP "WELFARISTS" WILL FACE THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN </p><p>CONVENTION (NRC), THE PARTY OF "PRIMORDIAL CAPITALISTS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  UNONGO IS A DYNAMIC, YOUTHFUL-APPEARING </p><p>POLITICIAN WHO APPEARS TO ENJOY A LOYAL FOLLOWING AMONG </p><p>THE TIV PEOPLE IN NORTHERN BENUE STATE.  AT A LUNCHEON AT </p><p>HIS RESIDENCE IN GBOKO, STATE-WIDE PSP OPERATIVES </p><p>DEFIANTLY PLEDGED TO ROUND UP THEIR SUPPORTERS TO REGISTER </p><p>SDP AND TO TAKE OVER AT STATE CONVENTIONS, TELLING CONGEN </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD BEAT BAGANGIDA AT HIS OWN GAME.  UNONGO </p><p>BASKED IN THEIR HOMAGE, CLEARLY INTENDING TO CONTINUE HIS </p><p>BEHIND-THE-SCENES ROLE AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MR. IYORKOHOL AKURE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BENUE STATE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND MINES, WAS </p><p>HIGHLY CRITICAL OF BABANDIGA\'S DECISION.  THE NEC </p><p>GUIDELINES FOR REGISTRATION WERE IMPOSSIBLE, HE STATED, </p><p>WITH THE TIME TOO SHORT, THE DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS </p><p>ONEROUS, THE RANGE TOO BROAD, AND THE COSTS PROHIBITIVE. </p><p>THE TWO NEW PARTIES MIRROR THE DISSOLVED PSP AND NIGERIAN </p><p>NATIONAL CONGRESS (NNC) IN OUTLOOK AND PHILOSOPHY, AND IN </p><p>FREE ELECTIONS WITH ALL 13 POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>CONTESTING AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THEY WOULD HAVE </p><p>PREVAILED, HE MAINTAINED.  WHAT THEN IS THE EFFICACY OF </p><p>THIS DECISION, HE ASKED.  HE CONTINUED THAT IT ONLY SHOWS </p><p>BABANGIDA\'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE NIGERIA POLITY, </p><p>HIS THEORETICAL AND IMPRACTICAL APPROACH TO POLITICAL </p><p>PROBLEMS, AND ABOVE ALL HIS CONTEMPT FOR NIGERIAN CIVILIAN </p><p>SOCIETY.  THE PRESIDENT IS PREDISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE </p><p>SUPERIORITY OF THE MILITARY AGAINST ALL EVIDENCE OF POOR </p><p>JUDGMENT AND SIMPLISTIC THOUGHT, HE OPINED.  IN SUM, THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON POLITICS, THE </p><p>FORMATION OF POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE NEC </p><p>VERIFICATION EXERCISE WERE DEGRADING AND DISILLUSIONING. </p><p> </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, AKURE SAID, THE PSP NATIONAL EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE IS RESIGNED TO THE NEW REALITY AND WILL ENJOIN </p><p>ITS FOLLOWERS TO REGISTER WITH THE SDP.  ON OCTOBER 2, </p><p>1992 - ONE DAY AFTER THE RETURN TO CIVILIAN RULE - THE SDP </p><p>WILL REWRITE ITS MANIFESTO TO REFLECT PSP VIEWS, RENDERING </p><p>BANBANGIDA\'S MOVE A PYRRHIC VICTORY, HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  AKURE\'S VIEWS, COMING ONE DAY AFTER THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD INITIAL CONSTERNATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT AMONG </p><p>BENUE STATE PSP ADHERENTS THAT THEIR ASSOCIATION HAD LOST </p><p>OUT.  AS ELSEWHERE THE DECISION WAS SOON VIEWED </p><p>AS JUST ONE MORE CHALLENGE THRUST UPON THEM BY BABANGIDA, </p><p>WHICH WOULD NOT, HOWEVER, ALTER THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF </p><p>NIGERIAN POLITICS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GONGOLA STATE </p><p>------------- </p><p>7.  ALHAJI BAMANGA MUHAMMED TUKUR - ELECTED CIVILIAN </p><p>GOVERNOR OF GONGOLA STATE (1983), FORMER GENERAL MANAGER </p><p>OF THE NIGERIAN PORTS AUTHORITY (1975-82), PROMINENT </p><p>BUSINESSMAN, AND TRADITIONAL TITLEHOLDER  (THE WAKILI </p><p>CHAMBA) - WAS EQUALLY CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DECISION.  TO HIM, THE NEW TWO PARTY SYSTEM, RATIFIED BY </p><p>THE COERCIVE "POWER-OF-THE-GUN," IS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE </p><p>IDEAS, FEELINGS, AND LOYALTIES IN THE PRACTICE OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  HOWEVER, TRUE DEMOCRACY MUST SPRING FROM THE </p><p>PEOPLE, WHICH EVEN THE U.S.S.R. AND EASTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES ARE REALIZING, AND NEEDS TIME TO DEVELOP, HE </p><p>SAID.  IT MUST GROW FROM INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND WANTS </p><p>COALESCING WITH OTHERS INTO GROUP DEMANDS AND THE </p><p>FORMULATION OF ASSOCIATIONS TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS </p><p>THROUGH POLITICAL ACTION, HE MAINTAINED.  THERE WILL BE NO </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IF AS A PEOPLE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEARN TO </p><p>GOVERN OURSELVES, TO MAKE MISTAKES, AND TO LEARN FROM </p><p>THEM, HE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>INSTEAD, HE SAID, THE DECISION FORCES PEOPLE TO THINK </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S IDEAS, ACCEPT ITS VIEWS, AND OPERATE WITHIN </p><p>ITS PRESCRIBED PARAMETERS.  MOREOVER, IT REINFORCES THE </p><p>IDEA OF THE INEVITABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MILITARY </p><p>RULE, HE CONTINUED.  ECHOING A THEME REPEATEDLY </p><p>HEARD, TUKUR SAID THAT THE MILITARY HAS RULED NIGERIA FOR </p><p>21-PLUS YEARS OF ITS 29 YEARS OF EXISTENCE.  THOSE FEW </p><p>SHORT YEARS OF CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION WERE INSUFFICIENT </p><p>TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF DEMOCRACY, HE SAID, BUT THE LONG </p><p>YEARS OF MILITARY CONTROL HAVE TAUGHT THAT THE POWER OF </p><p>COERCION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO RULE.  THE NEW </p><p>DECISION, CONTEMPTUOUS AND HUMILIATING, SHOWS BABANGIDA\'S </p><p>TRUE COLORS - A DEMAGOGUE, CONVINCED OF THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>SUPERIORITY, WHO WANTS TO REMAIN IN POWER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  TUKUR CRITIZED THE POLITICAL ASSOCIATION EXERCISE AS A </p><p>USELESS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  THE NEC REPORT MIRRORED </p><p>THE FMG\'S VIEW  THAT ALL CIVILIAN POLITICAL GROUPS AND </p><p>POLITICANS, OLD AND NEW ALIKE, ARE UNTRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE </p><p>BY THEIR VERY NATURE THEY OPPOSE THE SUPREMACY OF THE </p><p>MILITARY, HE SAID.  THE DECISION THUS PERPETUATES THE IDEA </p><p>THAT MILITARY RULE IS ACCEPTABLE, WHILE DISCREDITING THE </p><p>EDUCATED AND EXPERIENCED CIVILIAN LEADERS.  IN EFFECT, </p><p>THEN, THERE ARE ONLY TWO GROUPS IN NIGERIA - THE MILITARY </p><p>AND EVERYONE ELSE; THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TWO PARTIES </p><p>AND THE PEOPLE ALLOWED TO DECIDE, HE SUGGESTED. </p><p> </p><p>AS FOR THE NEW LEFT/RIGHT DICHOTOMY, TUKUR OPINED THAT </p><p>NIGERIA COULD NEVER BE TRULY LEFTIST BECAUSE IT IS TOO </p><p>DIVERSE, INSUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED, AND CULTURALLY </p><p>OPPOSED.  THE TRADITIONS OF CHIEFTANCY, RESPECT FOR </p><p>ELDERS, THE EDUCATED LEADING THE UNEDUCATED, AND THE </p><p>EXPERIENCED AS GUIDES CANNOT BE ABOLISHED BY MILITARY </p><p>FIAT.  MOREOVER, THE NIGERIAN PEOPLE ARE CAPITALISTS, </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED, AND FREE-THINKING, SO SOCIALIST AND </p><p>COLLECTIVIST IDEAS WILL NOT PROSPER, HE SAID.  EVEN SO, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOW IMPOSE IDEAS BASED ON THE THINKING </p><p>OF BUREAUCRATS CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY, SO ONE CANNOT </p><p>TELL.  IN ANY CASE, MEMBERS OF THE NEW PARTIES WILL HAVE </p><p>NO LOYALTY TO THE PARTY STRUCTURES OR THEIR IDEALS BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WILL NOT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT, HE </p><p>CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  ALHAJI TUKUR REFLECTS VIEWS COMMON AMONG </p><p>NORTHERN TRADITIONAL ELITES - COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY </p><p>TEMPERED BY LEADERSHIP BY THE ARISTOCRACY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALHAJI ADAMU IBRAHIM, FORMER LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF BALI, GONGOLA STATE, GAVE VIEWS FROM A </p><p>DIFFERENT, MORE GRASSROOTS PERSPECTIVE.  THE PFN, HE SAID, </p><p>HAD BEEN STRONGER IN HIS AREA THAN ANY OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION.  ITS LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN "NEW BREED" BUT </p><p>FOLLOWED PFN S DELI </p><p>FFROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL.  HE </p><p>WORRIES THAT THE NEC REPORT AND THE PRESIDENT\'S ADDRESS </p><p>AND DECISION SO CRITICIZED THESE BUDDING POLITICIANS THAT </p><p>THEY WILL NOW OPT OUT.  HAVING BEEN ELECTED IN DECEMBER </p><p>1987 ON PERSONAL MERIT, IBRAHIM HAD WANTED TO JOIN THE </p><p>REPUBLICAN PARTY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHAIRMEN, BUT THERE </p><p>WAS NO OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE IN GONGOLA STATE, GIVEN POOR </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS AND INSUFFICIENT TIME.  HE BELIEVES THAT </p><p>VOTERS WOULD FOLLOW HIM IF HE WERE TO INDICATE STRONG </p><p>INTEREST AND PREFERENCE FOR ONE OF THE NEW PARTIES, BUT HE </p><p>HAS DECIDED TO SIT IT OUT RATHER THAN HAVE A POLITICAL </p><p>PROGRAM IMPOSED UPON HIM.  (HE IS NOW GONGOLA STATE\'S </p><p>LIAISON OFFICER IN KADUNA.)  HE SUSPECTS THAT THE SDP WILL </p><p>DO WELL, GIVEN ITS WELFARIST STANCE, BUT THAT THE NRC WILL </p><p>BE VIEWED AS "MORE ISLAMIC."  IN THE END, PREFERENCE WILL </p><p>BE DEPENDENT ON WHICH WAY THE STATE AND NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP GO, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  ONE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF BABANGIDA\'S </p><p>DECISION MAY BE TO DRIVE OUT SOME OF THE MORE IDEALISTIC </p><p>POLITICAL NEOPHYTES WHO JOINED IN THE POLITICAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION FORMATION EXERCISE.  THE DISILLUSIONMENT </p><p>EXPRESSED BY ALHAJI IBRAHIM IS REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY </p><p>VIEWS CONGEN HEARD FROM MIDDLE-LEVEL GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>BUSINESS CONTACTS DURING THE VISIT TO BENUE AND GONGOLA </p><p>STATES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLMES </p><p></p></div>
