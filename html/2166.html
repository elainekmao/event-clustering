<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002857 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, NI, EING </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STATUS OF CHILD LABOR PROVISIONS FOR </p><p>TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT PROVISIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 182648 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Due to severe staffing shortages, particularly the </p><p>prolonged vacancy of Post\'s Labor officer position, Embassy </p><p>Abuja and Consulate Lagos are unable to meet reftel request </p><p>for "detailed and comprehensive information" on the status of </p><p>child labor in Nigeria.  The Regional Labor officer departed </p><p>Post in July and this critical position remains unfilled. </p><p>Many other vacancies have further weakened our capacity to </p><p>collect and interpret information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Indicator A: Laws and regulations proscribing the worst </p><p>forms of child labor </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Nigeria has agreed in principle to ratify ILO Conventions </p><p>182, Worst Form of Child Labor, and 138, Minimum Age for </p><p>Employment.  However, ratification will require approval by </p><p>the Federal Executive Council (equivalent of the U.S. </p><p>Cabinet) and a consenting vote by the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The 1974 Labor Decree strictly prohibits employment of </p><p>children under 15 years old in commerce and industry, and </p><p>permits child labor only for home-based agricultural or </p><p>domestic work.  The law states that children may not be </p><p>employed in agricultural or domestic work more than 8 hours </p><p>per day.  The decree allows the apprenticeship of youths at </p><p>age 13 under specific protective conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The 1974 Labor Decree and the 1999 Constitution prohibit </p><p>forced or compulsory labor, a prohibition that extends to </p><p>children, although they are not mentioned specifically in the </p><p>laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There is draft legislation now before the National </p><p>Assembly that would make trafficking in persons a crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Indicator B: Implementation and enforcement of laws </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Trafficking in children as indentured servants or for </p><p>criminal activities such as prostitution is a problem and </p><p>enforcement is ineffective.  According to ILO reports, there </p><p>is an active, extensive trade in child laborers, some of whom </p><p>are exported to Cameroon, Gabon, Benin and Equatorial Guinea </p><p>to work in agricultural enterprises.  Other children are </p><p>coerced into prostitution.  Authorities have identified trade </p><p>routes for traffickers that wind through Katsina and Sokoto </p><p>to the Middle East and East Africa.   The eastern part of </p><p>Nigeria and southern states such as Cross Rivers and Akwa </p><p>Ibom have been the loci of trafficking of children for labor. </p><p> Nigeria also remains a destination for the trafficking of </p><p>Togolese children.  An ILO report on child trafficking in </p><p>West Africa identified Nigeria as a source, destination and </p><p>transit area for child trafficking within the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There is evidence of trafficking of Nigerian children to </p><p>the United States and Europe, mostly for the reunification of </p><p>children with undocumented parents in destination countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Nigerian police report that, due to economic pressures, </p><p>the families of girls and women often condone their entry </p><p>into the sex trade.  During the past year, at least one </p><p>documented case of trafficking in children was reported in </p><p>Lagos, though incidents of trafficking in Lagos and other </p><p>major Nigerian cities are suspected to be commonplace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A rare and high-profile arrest of a suspected trafficker </p><p>occurred in mid-2001.  Bisi Dan Musa, a prominent Lagos </p><p>businesswoman and wife of a former Presidential aspirant, was </p><p>arrested and charged with 19 counts of &child stealing8 </p><p>(kidnapping) and slave dealing after 16 children, between one </p><p>and four years old, were found in her custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In August, 33 Nigerian women and children intercepted in </p><p>Conakry, Guinea, were repatriated to Nigeria following the </p><p>personal intervention of President Obasanjo.  As of this </p><p>writing, the Nigerian Government is planning to seek the </p><p>extradition of 15 Nigerian traffickers arrested by Guinea in </p><p>connection with the 33 women and girls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Basic economic incentives often underlie child </p><p>trafficking.  Generally, families who employ children as </p><p>domestic servants (a widespread practice in West Africa) also </p><p>pay their school fees.  Child traffickers receive a monthly </p><p>payment from the employer, part of which is remitted to the </p><p>parents of the indentured child servant. Traffickers take </p><p>advantage of a cultural tradition of child fostering, under </p><p>which it is acceptable to send a child to live and work with </p><p>a more prosperous family in return for educational and </p><p>vocational opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Indicator C: Institutional mechanisms to investigate and </p><p>address allegations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The absence of large numbers of documented reports of </p><p>trafficking is believed to result, in part, from ineffective </p><p>enforcement mechanisms, lack of resources, and weak </p><p>government commitment.  The GON has conducted few </p><p>investigations into the alleged involvement of government </p><p>officials in trafficking, though involvement of government </p><p>officials reportedly is widespread. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Police attempts to stem the trafficking of persons are </p><p>inadequate and too often focus on the victims of trafficking, </p><p>who are often subjected to lengthy detention and public </p><p>humiliation upon repatriation to Nigeria.  In contrast, </p><p>traffickers are rarely identified and punished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Labor Ministry has an Inspections Department whose </p><p>major responsibilities include enforcing the legal provisions </p><p>relating to conditions of work and protection of workers. </p><p>However, there are less than 50 inspectors for the entire </p><p>country.  The Ministry conducts inspections only in the </p><p>formal business sector, in which the incidence of child labor </p><p>is not significant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Indicator D: Social programs to prevent worst forms of </p><p>child labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Awareness campaigns, often conducted by spouses of </p><p>prominent politicians or non-governmental entities, have only </p><p>recently begun to garner widespread attention. Statistics are </p><p>insufficient to determine if these campaigns are productive. </p><p>The development of a reliable, statistically-valid base for </p><p>assessing the child trafficking problem has only recently </p><p>begun under ILO auspices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Primary education is compulsory, although this requirement </p><p>rarely is enforced.  Studies indicate declining school </p><p>enrollment due to deteriorated public schools and increased </p><p>economic pressures on families.  The lack of sufficient </p><p>primary schools and the high cost of school fees limit many </p><p>families\' access to education, inducing them to place their </p><p>children in the labor market.  Economic hardship leads to </p><p>high numbers of children in commercial activities aimed at </p><p>enhancing meager family income.  Children are frequently used </p><p>as beggars, hawkers, and bus conductors in urban areas.  The </p><p>use of children as domestic servants is common.  According to </p><p>data from the ILO (dated 1998) and UNICEF, the incidence of </p><p>child prostitution is growing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Private and government initiatives to stem the growing </p><p>incidence of child employment exist but are ineffective, </p><p>given the size of the problem, and the need for a </p><p>well-functioning legal system.  UNICEF operates programs that </p><p>remove young girls from the street hawking trade and relocate </p><p>them to informal educational settings.  UNICEF believes its </p><p>efforts only scratch the surface, however. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Indicator E: Whether Nigeria has a comprehensive policy </p><p>for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In conjunction with the ILO, the Nigerian government is </p><p>building a national program of action in support of child </p><p>rights, survival, protection, development and participation. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
