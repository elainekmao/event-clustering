IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE APPOINTMENT </p><p>WAS ANNOUNCED, ALL EYES ARE ON FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI, A TALENTED TECHNOCRAT WHO MANY BELIEVE IS THE </p><p>CABINET\'S MOST IMPORTANT MINISTER, WHILE INDUSTRY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO ARGUABLY HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04039  01 OF 03  210957Z </p><p>THE NUMBER TWO SPOT.  THE CHOICE OF MAKONI SURPRISED </p><p>MANY, GIVEN THE ROCKY RELATIONSHIP HE HAS HAD WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND RECENT INDICATIONS THAT MACON MIGHT JOIN </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC).  WE </p><p>THINK THAT THE IDEOLOGICALLY UNRECONSTRUCTED MUGABE WILL </p><p>NOT YIELD ANY POWER AND WILL BE UNABLE TO RESIST </p><p>MEDDLING IN MAKONI\'S BRIEF.  IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE </p><p>CASE, MAKONI MAY NOT LAST LONG IN THE JOB AND HIS MOST </p><p>POWERFUL WEAPON WOULD BE A CRITICALLY WORDED RESIGNATION </p><p>LETTER.  MUGABE MAY ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HIS NEW FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER BY ELEVATING HIM TO ZANU-PF\'S POLITBURO, A MOVE </p><p>THAT SURELY WILL BE RESISTED BY INSIDERS LIKE EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA AND SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI.  ZANU-PF OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>IN CAMPAIGN MODE FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND </p><p>IT IS NOT REALISTIC TO EXPECT ENLIGHTENED BEHAVIOR FROM </p><p>THEM.  THE BEST THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT MAKONI IS </p><p>LIKELY TO FIGHT HARD TO PUT IN PLACE SOUND ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES, BUT WILL ONLY WIN SOME OF THEM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WHEN PRESIDENT MUGABE APPOINTED HIS NEW CABINET, </p><p>IT WAS WIDELY AGREED THAT THE BEST NEWS WAS THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF DR. SIMBARASHE "SIMBA" HERBERT STANLEY </p><p>MAKONI AS MINISTER OF FINANCE.  THE CHOICE WAS SOMETHING </p><p>OF A SURPRISE, GIVEN PAST TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO MEN. </p><p>ONCE A RISING STAR IN CABINET AS ENERGY MINISTER, </p><p>MAKONI, LATER AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE STATE-OWNED </p><p>NEWSPAPER CORPORATION, ANGERED MUGABE AFTER TRYING TO </p><p>SUSPEND "SUNDAY MAIL" EDITOR CHARLES CHIKEREMA, A ZANU- </p><p>PF HEAVYWEIGHT.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT ARRANGED FOR </p><p>POLITICALLY CENTRIST MAKONI TO BE PUSHED OUT OF HIS </p><p>POSITION AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04039  01 OF 03  210957Z </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, A POSITION HE HELD FROM 1984 TO </p><p>1993.  MAKONI IS SEEN AS THE MOST IMPORTANT MINISTER IN </p><p>THE NEW CABINET, AND, LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER MAKONI\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT, ALL EYES ARE ON HIM.  MINISTER OF INDUSTRY </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE NKOSANA MOYO, WHO UNTIL LAST </p><p>WEEK DID NOT HAVE A ZANU-PF PARTY CARD, IS IN THE SAME </p><p>LEAGUE AND HAS RECEIVED ALMOST AS MUCH ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THERE ARE TWO STORIES CIRCULATING IN HARARE ON </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF THE CAPABLE SIMBA MAKONI AS MINISTER </p><p>OF FINANCE.  THE FIRST IS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE ASKED </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA TO INFORM MAKONI OF HIS </p><p>DECISION.  WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT DID SO, THE MINISTER </p><p>DESIGNATE ASKED FOR AN AUDIENCE WITH MUGABE TO DISCUSS </p><p>HOW HE WOULD HANDLE THE PORTFOLIO.  MSIKA TOOK THE </p><p>MESSAGE BACK, AND IN TYPICAL MUGABE FASHION NO AUDIENCE </p><p>TOOK PLACE AND THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE.  IN THE </p><p>SECOND VERSION, MAKONI ACTUALLY MET WITH MUGABE FOR </p><p>THREE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME HE SPELLED OUT THE </p><p>CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH HE WOULD ACCEPT THE APPOINTMENT. </p><p>DEPENDING ON WHICH VERSION YOU BELIEVE, EITHER MUGABE OR </p><p>MAKONI HAS ALREADY WON THE FIRST OF WHAT ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>BE MANY BATTLES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4494 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04039  02 OF 03  210957Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------70E1F0  210959Z /38 </p><p>P 211002Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6666 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY MASERU </p><p>AMEMBASSY MBABANE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04039  02 OF 03  210957Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR R.

(C) SOME CRITICS, FOR EXAMPLE MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, BELIEVE THAT MAKONI\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>APPOINTMENT WAS IN ITSELF A CAPITULATION TO MUGABE.  IT </p><p>CAUGHT THE OPPOSITION LEADER BY SURPRISE BECAUSE AT ONE </p><p>POINT IT APPEARED PROBABLE THAT MAKONI MIGHT JOIN THE </p><p>MDC, ADDING TO THE NEW PARTY\'S INTELLECTUAL HEFT AND </p><p>PRESTIGE.  TSVANGIRAI TOLD AN OFFICER OF THE BRITISH </p><p>HIGH COMMISSION HERE THAT HE THOUGHT MAKONI WAS A </p><p>"COWARD," AND THAT IF HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO </p><p>ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL CAREER, HE WAS WRONG. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04039  02 OF 03  210957Z </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, MAKONI HAS A REPUTATION FOR INDEPENDENT </p><p>THINKING, AND IF MUGABE DOES WISH TO CO-OPT HIM, </p><p>ELEVATING HIM TO THE POLITBURO OF ZANU-PF IS PROBABLY </p><p>THE BEST WAY TO DO SO.  THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY LIKELY </p><p>WILL APPLAUD THE MOVE, AS IT WILL GIVE MAKONI THE </p><p>POLITICAL CLOUT TO PURSUE HIS POLICIES.  SIMILARLY, IT </p><p>MAY SHOW THE POPULATION THAT MUGABE IS FORGIVING, IN THE </p><p>TRADITION OF AFRICAN CHIEFS, OF A "LITTLE MAN" WHO ONCE </p><p>INSULTED HIM.  FINALLY, MAKONI WOULD BE A "MADE MAN," </p><p>DEPENDENT ON THE ONE WHO MADE HIM -- MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TSVANGIRAI\'S PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, MANY OBSERVERS HERE SEE MAKONI AND MOYO </p><p>OPERATING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.  THEY ARGUE THAT </p><p>IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE TWO MEN WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED </p><p>THEIR POSITIONS IF IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT </p><p>THEIR HANDS WOULD BE COMPLETELY TIED.  FURTHERMORE, IF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT HAD SIMPLY WANTED A ZANU-PF PARTY HACK, HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE APPOINTED ONE.  IN FACT, WE UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT MADE THE APPOINTMENT AT THE PRODDING OF SOME </p><p>MEMBERS OF HIS ENTOURAGE, WHO SEE ADDRESSING THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC ILLS AS THE KEY TO ZANU-PF\'S (AS WELL </p><p>AS THEIR) OWN SURVIVAL.  THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS </p><p>PROBABLY NOT CONVINCED THAT THE ECONOMY IS THE MOST </p><p>PRESSING ISSUE ON HIS AGENDA, BUT HE LIKES TO SURPRISE </p><p>AND CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, AND THUS AGREED TO </p><p>MAKE THE APPOINTMENT.  IF THE TWO MINISTERS DO FIND </p><p>THEMSELVES STYMIED BY MUGABE, THEIR MOST POWERFUL WEAPON </p><p>AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE A CRITICALLY WORDED LETTER OF </p><p>RESIGNATION, SHOULD PRESIDENTIAL INTERFERENCE IN THEIR </p><p>PORTFOLIO MAKE THEIR POSITION UNTENABLE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04039  02 OF 03  210957Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) EVEN IF MUGABE DOES NOT ACT DIRECTLY TO THWART </p><p>MAKONI, THE NEW FINANCE MINISTER STILL FACES A DIFFICULT </p><p>TASK.  WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE FOR MINIMIZING THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE, AND THE NATURE OF THE </p><p>DOMESTIC DEBATE IS SHIFTING TOWARD ECONOMICS, CURRENT </p><p>CONDITIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO REACH DECISIONS ON THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  WHILE MAKONI IS AN ABLE TECHNOCRAT, HE LACKS </p><p>THE POLITICAL BASE OR CLOUT TO ENFORCE THE TOUGH </p><p>ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.  HE ENJOYS THE </p><p>SUPPORT AND RESPECT OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, BUT </p><p>GETTING TOO CLOSE TO IT WOULD RAISE THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>SUSPICIONS, AS MUGABE PERCEIVES IT AS THE ENEMY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE BOSSY AND IDEOLOGICALLY UNRECONSTRUCTED </p><p>MUGABE MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST MEDDLING WITH </p><p>MAKONI\'S PORTFOLIO.  MEMBERS OF THE ZANU-PF INNER </p><p>CIRCLE, SUCH AS EMMERSON MNANGAGWA AND SYDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI, WOULD SEE MAKONI\'S SUDDEN RISE INTO THE </p><p>POLITBURO AS A THREAT TO THEIR INTERESTS AND WOULD DO </p><p>EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO BLOCK IT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FURTHERMORE, ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE MAKONI\'S CONTROL, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4485 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04039  03 OF 03  210958Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------70E203  210958Z /38 </p><p>P 211002Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6667 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY MASERU </p><p>AMEMBASSY MBABANE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04039  03 OF 03  210958Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR R.
