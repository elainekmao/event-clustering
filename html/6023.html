President Sezer\'s warning about </p><p>the lack of international legitimacy for an Iraq operation </p><p>has forced the government to seek the counsel of the NSC. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" and "Milliyet" blame the government for `hiding </p><p>behind the NSC\' after having failed to obtain solid </p><p>guarantees from the U.S.  Papers say that the U.S. has given </p><p>Turkey no guarantees of blocking the establishment of a </p><p>Kurdish state, and reports suggest continued ambiguity </p><p>regarding the economic aid package.  "Vatan" claims that the </p><p>voting was delayed due to strong opposition among AKP </p><p>deputies.  Dailies expect 38,000 of the total 45,000 U.S. </p><p>troops deployed in Turkey to pass into northern Iraq, with </p><p>the remaining 7,000 to be stationed on Turkish soil.  60,000 </p><p>Turkish troops will set up a 30 km security zone inside </p><p>northern Iraq.  Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups, upset by the </p><p>fact that Turkey and the U.S. are close to a compromise, </p><p>staged protest demonstrations against Turkey in Erbil.  KDP </p><p>leader Barzani reportedly said at the Iraqi opposition </p><p>conference in Sulaimania that Turkey should not interfere in </p><p>the Kurds\' internal affairs.  Meanwhile, the MFA has issued </p><p>a warning for Turkish citizens to leave Iraq in order to </p><p>avert `likely risks.\'  Some NGOs and labor unions will stage </p><p>a large rally against the war in Ankara on Saturday. </p><p>Cyprus: UN Secretary General Annan, in Cyprus for talks, has </p><p>suggested that Papadopoulos and Denktas take the third plan </p><p>to a referendum on March 30, and he invited the two leaders </p><p>to The Hague on March 10 to sign an agreement.  Denktas </p><p>rejected Annan\'s offer, saying that the new plan has many </p><p>`traps.\'  "Hurriyet" believes that Annan, seeing Denktas as </p><p>the largest obstacle to a compromise, intended to by-pass </p><p>the Turkish Cypriot leader.  Papers report that about 70,000 </p><p>Turkish Cypriots attended a rally against Denktas, with some </p><p>demonstrators carrying placards saying `Rescue us, Annan,\' </p><p>`We are all Cypriots, let\'s unite,\' and `Give peace a </p><p>chance.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkey on Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There is a chance to delay the war" </p><p>Fehmi Koru suggested in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(2/28): "Even the founding principles of the Turkish </p><p>republic have been forgotten.  Oddly enough, Turkey debated </p><p>the possibility of preventing a war during the Gulf crisis. </p><p>. There is not much difference regarding the essential </p><p>principles and sensitivities about the situation today and </p><p>the 1990s.  Yet I am still looking for an authorized </p><p>representative who will stand up and ask the very basic </p><p>question: What has Turkey got to do with somebody else\'s </p><p>war? .  The parliamentarians better listen to the warning of </p><p>President Sezer very carefully and wait until international </p><p>legitimacy has been ensured.   The authorization debate at </p><p>the parliament must be postponed until the next UN </p><p>resolution." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US weighs the importance of Turkey and the Kurds" </p><p>Sedat Ergin analyzed the reasons for the anti-Turkish </p><p>sentiment among some Iraqi Kurdish groups in mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (2/28): "There are certain factors and reasons for </p><p>the hostility, which can be listed as follows: </p><p>1)   the Barzani factor: The threatening, anti-Turkish </p><p>remarks mostly come from KDP leader Barzani, not from PUK </p><p>leader Talabani. This is explained by the fact Turkey\'s </p><p>border are is under the control of Barzani. </p><p>2)   the psychological factor: Kurdish groups will be </p><p>uncomfortable if the Turkish army enters northern Iraq. They </p><p>will consider the presence of a colossal foreign military </p><p>force -- around 40,000 -- in their territory as a threat to </p><p>their aspirations for sovereignty. </p><p>3)   Domestic policy considerations: The Kurdish leaders </p><p>might be trying to address the public at home by making </p><p>threatening remarks against Turkey. </p><p>4)   the Turkey-US deal: The timing of the Kurdish threats </p><p>is also very important. </p><p>They came after details about the political and military </p><p>agreements discussed by Turkey and the US were leaked to the </p><p>press. It is clear that Kurdish leaders were disappointed by </p><p>the guarantees given by the US to Turkey. </p><p>5)   the federation problem: Kurdish leaders might be </p><p>disappointed by the references to a federation in the </p><p>political agreement between Turkey and the US. Barzani was </p><p>planning to form a federation on an ethnic basis in the post- </p><p>war era.  He may very well be disappointed to see the </p><p>obstacles placed in front of his goal. </p><p>6)   the future of the peshmerges:  Once the unified Iraqi </p><p>army is formed, both Barzani and Talabani will have to </p><p>dissolve their local forces. The Kurdish leaders must have </p><p>been bothered by the fact that after the war the US is </p><p>planning to take back the weapons distributed to the Kurds, </p><p>and by the fact that this operation will be carried out the </p><p>observation of the Turks. The Iraqi Kurds are uneasy with </p><p>the control mechanisms set up by Turkey. </p><p>7)   the deterrent effect of Turkish troops: The Turkish </p><p>army says it will go into Northern Iraq for humanitarian </p><p>activities. The Iraqi Kurds, however, see the situation </p><p>differently. They know that the Turkish army will be present </p><p>in northern Iraq to avoid  `undesirable developments.\' The </p><p>presence of the Turkish army will restrict the movements of </p><p>the Kurds and will block their aspirations for independence </p><p>or for acquiring control of oil-rich regions. </p><p>8)   Turkey-US plan not compatible with Kurdish plans: The </p><p>plans for a post-war Iraq designed by the US and Turkey are </p><p>not compatible with the plans of the Iraqi Kurds. The Kurds </p><p>will have to give up certain privileges they acquired during </p><p>as a result of the power vacuum, including de-facto </p><p>sovereignty status, since 1991.  Ironically, they might even </p><p>prefer that Saddam Hussein stays in power. </p><p>9)   Bargaining tool: It is possible that the Iraqi Kurds </p><p>are deliberately aggravating the tension with Turkey in </p><p>order to win more support from the US. They hope to change </p><p>the balances in their favor after the war. </p><p>10)  Suspicions about US intentions: Just like Turkish </p><p>decision-makers, the Kurds might be suspicious about US </p><p>intentions in a post-war Iraq. They are afraid that the US </p><p>will abandon the Kurds by giving major concessions to </p><p>Turkey. </p><p>11)  The US needs the northern front and wants to increase </p><p>its strategic cooperation with Turkey to topple Saddam </p><p>Hussein. Thus, the strategic importance of Turkey weighs </p><p>more than the importance of the Kurdish groups in the eyes </p><p>of the US.  Nevertheless, Turkey should not forget the </p><p>possibility that the situation might change after the war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
