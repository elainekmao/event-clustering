<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: RECONCILIATION EFFORTS IN NEPALI CONGRESS PARTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1055 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Efforts to reconcile intra-party rivals Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Nepali Congress President and </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala appear headed in the right </p><p>direction.  Koirala has directed party peacemakers to patch </p><p>things up during his upcoming jaunt to China June 1.  In a </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador May 31, Koirala said his party </p><p>will participate in the November 13 elections, but stressed </p><p>his continuing fear that royal and/or military interference </p><p>may undermine chances that they are free and fear.  The </p><p>business community appears to be solidly behind PM Deuba and </p><p>may threaten to withhold customary contributions to the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party if intra-party squabbling continues. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>EFFORTS AT RECONCILIATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Neutral-minded leaders in the Nepali Congress Party, </p><p>such as former Deputy Prime Minister Ram Chandra Poudel, </p><p>former Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, and former Speaker </p><p>Taranath Ranabhat, are joining party patriarch K.P. </p><p>Bhattarai\'s ongoing efforts to heal the rift between Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and former Prime Minister and </p><p>Nepali Congress Party President G.P. Koirala (Reftel).  Mahat </p><p>told the Ambassador May 30 Koirala admitted to the </p><p>peacemakers that expelling Deuba from the party was a </p><p>mistake, and is looking for a face-saving way out of the </p><p>impasse.  Koirala will leave for a four-day visit to China </p><p>June 1 and will likely do nothing, however, until after his </p><p>return. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Some party insiders have told us that while Koirala </p><p>may have seen the error of his ways, his supporters seem </p><p>hell-bent on fueling the antagonism between the two leaders, </p><p>making any possible conciliatory gesture all the more </p><p>difficult.  Among the most rabid is said to be G.P.\'s </p><p>daughter Sujata, who has political aspirations of her own and </p><p>sees Deuba (who is closer to her age than to her father\'s) as </p><p>a significant obstacle to her dynasty-building. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Complicating efforts at reconciliation, however, is </p><p>the personalization of politics both Deuba and Koirala </p><p>cultivate.  Former Cabinet member and Deuba friend Ram Sharan </p><p>Mahat said Deuba typically took any opposition to his wishes </p><p>in the Cabinet as a personal attack.  Extension of the </p><p>emergency should have been argued on its own merits, Mahat </p><p>said; instead, Deuba made it a test of personal loyalty to </p><p>him. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>KOIRALA: LEAVE IT TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION </p><p>TO SORT OUT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Ambassador met with Koirala at the former PM\'s </p><p>residence May 31.  Koirala said his principal concern now is </p><p>that the elections scheduled for November 13 be free and </p><p>fair. People don\'t want elections now, he opined.  Conditions </p><p>are not conducive; the insurgency has fueled an atmosphere of </p><p>fear, and there is doubt about how the military and police </p><p>will conduct themselves during the polling.  But since the PM </p><p>has called elections, the Nepali Congress Party, as a </p><p>democratic institution, will participate.  He told the </p><p>Ambassador he had met with human rights groups the previous </p><p>day to emphasize the need for neutral and effective election </p><p>monitoring, and noted that he plans to travel to the </p><p>districts soon to assess the situation.  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that he and other donors have stressed to all </p><p>involved--including PM Deuba, the King, and the </p><p>military--that ensuring free and fair elections in November </p><p>is critical.  All seemed to understand the importance and </p><p>pledged their support.  The Embassy is also looking at how it </p><p>can be helpful during the elections in other ways, such as </p><p>voter education.  Koirala said he was glad to hear of the </p><p>King\'s reaction, but asked rhetorically how "serious" the </p><p>monarch\'s assurances are. </p><p>6.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that the Nepali Congress Party </p><p>faces the additional challenge of attempting to mount a </p><p>national election campaign when its internal house is in </p><p>disarray.  Koriala acknowledged that some party leaders, </p><p>including the aged and increasingly frail K.P. Bhattarai, are </p><p>trying to patch up the rift.  He said he has told "the </p><p>younger generation" (i.e., younger than Koirala, who is </p><p>nearly 80) that since he is close to retirement, the future </p><p>of the party depends on them and it is thus up to them to </p><p>find a solution to the problem while he is in China.  (Note: </p><p>Koirala also told the Ambassador eight years ago that his </p><p>generation was then ready to step away from the political </p><p>scene and let the younger generation of party leaders run </p><p>things.  End note.)   He expects some such accommodation will </p><p>be found during his absence.  PM Deuba had committed "a </p><p>Himalayan blunder" in dissolving Parliament, Koirala said, </p><p>after assuring the all-party meeting May 22 that he would </p><p>withdraw his proposal to extend the emergency.  That Deuba </p><p>moved to dissolve Parliament at almost midnight without </p><p>consulting either the Nepali Congress MPs or his own Cabinet </p><p>leads Koirala to suspect "something fishy" in the decision. </p><p>In the previous three dissolutions, the late King Birendra </p><p>had always waited 48 hours to consult lawyers, political </p><p>leaders and others before making his decision.  This new </p><p>King, on the other hand, "moved fast," Koirala observed, </p><p>repeating, "That\'s why I feel there is something fishy."   He </p><p>appealed to the Ambassador to tell the King not to let the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) interfere with the elections. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Why should the King or military wish to undermine </p><p>free and fair elections?  Koirala said he had been </p><p>conducting, with the King\'s knowledge, some behind-the-scenes </p><p>talks with Maoist leaders aimed at restarting dialogue.  The </p><p>King was "positive" toward the initiative, directing Koirala </p><p>to determine the Maoists\' "bottom line" on negotiations.   He </p><p>surmised that the King may not have liked Koirala\'s previous </p><p>public statement that the Maoists should deal with </p><p>Parliament, as the true representatives of the people, since </p><p>the King "doesn\'t want to give credit to Parliament." </p><p>Koirala said he had proposed a referendum on amending the </p><p>Constitution (but not amending essential elements that ensure </p><p>a multiparty democracy, human rights, and a Constitutional </p><p>monarchy).  The informal talks "were going on," but now </p><p>"everything is disrupted."  He intimated that he believes the </p><p>King (and perhaps the military) may have been uncomfortable </p><p>with his progress with the Maoists. </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>BUSINESS LEADERS TO USE CHECKBOOK INFLUENCE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  A number of business leaders have told us they back </p><p>Deuba, and while they would prefer to see fences mended, do </p><p>not want a reconciliation that will only mean continued </p><p>in-fighting and influence peddling.  A meeting Deuba held </p><p>with business leaders May 29 produced a public statement of </p><p>support for him.  President of the Federated Nepal Chambers </p><p>of Commerce and Industry Ravi Bhakta Shrestha told Ambassador </p><p>May 30 that the business community will also use its </p><p>influence to try to mend things in the party.  Specifically, </p><p>Shrestha said his well-heeled members could put Koirala and </p><p>others on notice that partisan bickering is bad for business, </p><p>sends the wrong signal to investors, and is hurting the </p><p>economy.  (Note:  Businessmen are also not likely to welcome </p><p>the United Marxist-Leninist (UML) government that is almost </p><p>certain to win the election if the Nepali Congress Party </p><p>splits.  End note.)  If steps are not taken to improve </p><p>intra-party relations, Shrestha will warn, the Nepali </p><p>Congress can expect significantly reduced contributions from </p><p>the business community in the upcoming elections.  According </p><p>to former Finance Minister Mahat, the Koirala camp is hurting </p><p>for cash, while Deuba has the advantage of being in office </p><p>going for him. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Since a Nepali Congress Party split almost certainly </p><p>means an Opposition victory at the polls, we are not </p><p>surprised that Koirala has instructed the would-be </p><p>peacemakers to clean up the mess he and Deuba have made while </p><p>he is on a face-saving "mission" out of the country.  We </p><p>expect an accommodation will be reached upon his return.  We </p><p>also expect him to keep up the drumbeat of worry about free </p><p>and fair elections--with the inevitable, implicit link to </p><p>possible Palace/military underhandedness in the process.  We </p><p>will continue to underscore to all players our interest--and </p><p>theirs--in securing free and fair elections that are, to the </p><p>extent possible, held on time.  We would like to offer </p><p>assistance, as we have in the past, to support such </p><p>elections, and are now looking at possible ways to be helpful </p><p>in this process. We recommend possible donor support for the </p><p>elections as a topic for discussion at the upcoming meeting </p><p>on Nepal in London June 19-20. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
