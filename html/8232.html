No date has been set yet for the third round of peace </p><p>talks.  However, the controversy continues around </p><p>restrictions on the movements of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA). </p><p>Maoist leaders have demanded explanations for the statements </p><p>made by Ramesh Nath Pandey, Minister for Information and </p><p>Communication and government negotiating team member, </p><p>denying that any agreement has been reached about limiting </p><p>the RNA.  The release of three Maoist Central Committee </p><p>Members has been delayed.  The RNA continues its </p><p>humanitarian assistance and medical treatment outreach </p><p>efforts.  Amnesty International (AI) announced on May 19 </p><p>that it intends to send a delegation to Nepal.  The All </p><p>Nepal National Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary </p><p>(ANNISU) has forced the closure of accounting offices in </p><p>over twenty-four private schools.  A Maoist Central </p><p>Committee Member admitted in a local interview that fear of </p><p>the U.S. military drove the Maoists to the negotiating </p><p>table.  Maoists abducted fifteen civilians, tortured four </p><p>others, and continue to extort money.  Victims of the Maoist </p><p>insurgency continue to voice their objections to being </p><p>excluded from the peace process.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS WANT PANDEY OUT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Baburam Bhattarai, Maoist ideologue and head of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team, angrily reacted to statements by </p><p>Ramesh Nath Pandey, Minister for Information and </p><p>Communication and government negotiating team member, in </p><p>which Pandey said that no agreement was reached regarding </p><p>the restriction of the Royal Nepal Army\'s (RNA\'s) movements </p><p>to only five kilometers from their barracks (Ref A). </p><p>Bhattarai, speaking at a hastily called press conference on </p><p>May 15, said Pandey\'s denial of the agreement was a "blatant </p><p>lie" and a betrayal of the peace process.  The Maoist </p><p>ideologue reiterated his claim that the agreement to </p><p>restrict the RNA\'s movements was reached during the second </p><p>round of peace talks, and said the government should get rid </p><p>of the "liars" on its team.  In addition to the demand for a </p><p>new "trustworthy and powerful (government) team," Bhattarai </p><p>said that the Maoists want clarification of Pandey\'s </p><p>statements, an immediate halt to international intervention </p><p>and "dubious" activities, the immediate release of their </p><p>three Central Committee Members, and a halt to public </p><p>comments by the army. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and </p><p>Works and government negotiating team member, in response to </p><p>Bhattarai\'s complaints against Pandey, said that there had </p><p>been some "misunderstandings" between the government and the </p><p>Maoists, but told reporters that the Maoists were right </p><p>about the agreement made to restrict the army.  In direct </p><p>contrast to Pun\'s statement, however, Badri Narayan Basnet, </p><p>Minister for Forest and Soil Conservation, reportedly </p><p>concurred with Pandey and said that no agreement had been </p><p>reached.  To date, the RNA has continued normal operations. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS FEAR U.S. MILITARY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  During an interview with a local publication in May, </p><p>Matrika Prasad Yadav, a Maoist Politburo member and </p><p>negotiating team member, conceded that the fear of American </p><p>intervention prompted the Maoists to return to the </p><p>negotiating table.  Yadav reportedly said that the growing </p><p>influence of the United States remains a concern to the </p><p>Maoists.  The insurgents have enjoyed many victories over </p><p>GON security forces, Yadav claimed, but conceded that the </p><p>Maoists are not ready to take on American forces and will </p><p>remain at the negotiating table as long as necessary to </p><p>forestall more direct U.S. military involvement. </p><p> </p><p>RELEASE OF MAOIST LEADERS DELAYED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Despite reported government assurances that the Maoists\' </p><p>three Central Committee Members would be released, the GON </p><p>instead filed a detention order, extending the prison </p><p>sentence another six months for one of them.  Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, issued a press release on </p><p>May 21 criticizing the move, and declared the Maoists were </p><p>taking this action "very seriously."  Mahara questioned the </p><p>GON\'s motives in extending the jail sentence and accused the </p><p>GON of violating the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST VIOLATIONS INCREASE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Maoist cadres have continued to violate the ceasefire </p><p>agreement by abducting civilians in three separate </p><p>southeastern districts.  Two civilians were abducted from </p><p>Siraha District on May 20, while on May 19, nine family </p><p>members were abducted by insurgents in Dhanusha District. </p><p>The family members reportedly are members of the Nepali </p><p>Congress (NC) party, and had refused to contribute to the </p><p>Maoists.  The insurgents also reportedly accused them of </p><p>being informants.  Their whereabouts remain unknown. </p><p>Maoists also abducted three former members of local Village </p><p>Development Committees (VDCs) in Sindhuli District, and </p><p>another Nepali Congress supporter from Morang District, who </p><p>remains missing.  Four civilians, including a woman, were </p><p>tortured by Maoists in the northern district of Gorkha after </p><p>the insurgents were given tap water to drink instead of </p><p>filtered water. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Maoists reportedly have continued extorting money from </p><p>tourists in the northeastern region of Dolakha, demanding </p><p>"donations" from as many as seven tourist groups in a week. </p><p>According to press reports, the Maoist leaders in the region </p><p>have admitted the practice, declaring that the money will be </p><p>used for "development purposes," and therefore is not a </p><p>violation of the code of conduct.  In the mid-western </p><p>district of Rolpa, the insurgents reportedly have also been </p><p>issuing trading licenses to local merchants.  Merchants are </p><p>forced to give a "voluntary donation" in order to receive </p><p>permission to sell their goods.  The Rolpa Chief District </p><p>Officer (CDO) was quoted as saying that the Maoists are in </p><p>direct violation of the code of conduct, and that the </p><p>activities should stop immediately. </p><p> </p><p>RNA CONTINUES HEALTH CAMPS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) conducted free health camps </p><p>across Nepal, providing dental care, medical treatment, and </p><p>various humanitarian services (Ref B).  According to press </p><p>reports, Army personnel provided assistance to almost four </p><p>thousand villagers in the districts of Surkhet, Siraha, </p><p>Bharatpur, Itahari, Sindhuli, Dolakha, and Udayapur.  The </p><p>army also distributed supplies to elementary schools in </p><p>Udayapar District, and repaired desks and benches in the </p><p>schools.  In Bharatpur, a blood drive was also held. </p><p> </p><p>AI TO SEND DELEGATION TO NEPAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  Amnesty International (AI) announced on May 19 that it </p><p>will send a delegation to Nepal to discuss its concern over </p><p>increasing human rights violations by both the security </p><p>forces and the insurgents, despite a three-month ceasefire. </p><p>In its press release, AI urged the Maoists and the GON to </p><p>establish immediately an effective monitoring team, and </p><p>provide the necessary resources to conduct impartial </p><p>investigations of alleged human rights violations. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R THREATENS TO CLOSE PRIVATE SCHOOLS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU) has forced the closure of accounting </p><p>offices in over twenty-four schools.  The Maoist aligned </p><p>student group said the offices would be closed indefinitely. </p><p>The disruption in services and continued threats from </p><p>members of ANNISU-R has caused some private schools to </p><p>consider closing permanently, and has stirred the anger of </p><p>parents, many of whom are pleading with school principals to </p><p>keep the schools open.  ANNISU-R has demanded that tuition </p><p>fees be lowered, and locked the accounting offices in </p><p>protest. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST VICTIMS DEMAND JUSTICE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Victims of the Maoist insurgency complain that they </p><p>remain without a voice in the peace process.  The daughter </p><p>of Mohan Krishna Shrestha, the Inspector General of the </p><p>Armed Police Force, who was brutally murdered along with his </p><p>wife and bodyguard (Ref C), told a local publication on May </p><p>16 that the GON should not have released those responsible </p><p>for her parents\' murder.  Shrestha said the murders have </p><p>been forgotten under the pretext of not disturbing the peace </p><p>process.  Victims\' groups have been persistent in trying to </p><p>get their needs on the agenda, but Minister Pun acknowledged </p><p>that the issue of civilian killings has not yet "figured </p><p>into the peace negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
