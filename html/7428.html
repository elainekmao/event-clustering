<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>APRIL 14, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 14, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Evrensel/Bolge: The US and its collaborators </p><p>were condemned at a "Today Iraq, Tomorrow Turkey" </p><p>protest meeting in Adana yesterday. Carrying </p><p>banners and shouting slogans, approximately one </p><p>thousand people gathered at  Railway Station </p><p>Square. The head of the organizing committee -- </p><p>an employee of Radio Arkadas, Mehmet Eraslan -- </p><p>called out to everybody to resist against </p><p>oppression. He added that everybody was watching </p><p>the occupation from live TV programs and the </p><p>whole world saw Bush\'s and the US\'s true face. </p><p>Journalists, such as Abdurrahman Dilipak and </p><p>Sanar Yurdatapan, and the President of the </p><p>International Assistance Foundation, Bulent </p><p>Yildirim, also participated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Sabah/Hurriyet: Ankara was comforted as </p><p>diplomatic and military sources in Iraq reported </p><p>that there were no systematic attacks against </p><p>Turkomen in Kirkuk. The reports by Turkish </p><p>liaison officers verified that there had been </p><p>some individual attacks but attributed that to </p><p>the prevailing disorder in the country. The </p><p>Turkish officers talking to locals in Kirkuk and </p><p>Mosul reported that most of the property-deed </p><p>records were intact, as only some had been </p><p>damaged due to looting. The report emphasized </p><p>that the majority of the peshmergas in Kirkuk had </p><p>pulled out but some had stayed in town under the </p><p>US forces\' control to provide security. The PUK </p><p>officials ensured they would withdraw the rest of </p><p>their forces as more US units arrived in the </p><p>town. On the other hand, an armed attack killing </p><p>one child and wounding four adults was launched </p><p>yesterday evening at the Turkomen Front in </p><p>Kirkuk, which blamed PUK peshmergas for it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Sabah/Dunya: While the PUK leader, Celal </p><p>Talabani, warned neighboring countries not to </p><p>intervene in their domestic affairs, the KDP </p><p>leader, Barzani, demanded that Turkey should give </p><p>up claims to ownership of the oil fields. It is </p><p>reported by IRNA (Iranian News Agency) that at a </p><p>Kirkuk meeting the previous day -- attended by </p><p>Kurdish, Arab, Turkomen, and Assyrian </p><p>representatives - Talabani said all these </p><p>communities lived in Kirkuk in a peaceful </p><p>atmosphere. Barzani stated that KDP respected all </p><p>the accords signed with the coalition forces and </p><p>the Iraqi Opposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: The body of Murat Ekinci, 22, who </p><p>was doing his military service in the 8th Commando </p><p>Unit of the 3rd Mountain and Commando Battalion in </p><p>Semdinli (Hakkari) was returned to his family in </p><p>Diyarbakir for burial. A military officer calling </p><p>the Ekinci family on April 10 told them that </p><p>their son was wounded in an accident but he was </p><p>in good health. Nevzat Ekinci who called the 8th </p><p>Commando Unit to find out more about his </p><p>brother\'s condition was told by another officer </p><p>that his brother had passed away because of </p><p>committing suicide, and expressed his </p><p>condolences. The military officials told the </p><p>Ekinci family that the dead body would be flown </p><p>by helicopter to Diyarbakir the same night, and </p><p>there was no need for the family to go all the </p><p>way to Hakkari. The family was told next morning </p><p>that the corpse had been dispatched by land </p><p>transport. Nevzat Ekinci said the request for </p><p>conducting an autopsy on the body was refused by </p><p>military officials, on the grounds that they </p><p>already had run the autopsy and the deceased was </p><p>ready for burial. The family was not allowed to </p><p>see even the face of the dead body. Nevzat Ekinci </p><p>said his family demanded legal assistance from </p><p>HRA\'s Chapter in Diyarbakir for a determination </p><p>whether his brother had committed suicide or been </p><p>murdered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Evrensel: In order to investigate an April 5 </p><p>explosion that killed two persons in Esenyamac </p><p>(Baskale, Van Province), a delegation made up of </p><p>lawyers and human rights advocates called on </p><p>Baskale\'s Chief Public Prosecutor and Sub- </p><p>governor yesterday. The delegation will start is </p><p>investigation in the village today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet/Turkiye: At the Commando Battalion </p><p>in Palu (Elazig), a commando private who went </p><p>insane killed two soldiers and wounded two others </p><p>with whom he had had a quarrel about the duty </p><p>roster. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Evrensel: The Adana Cukurova University </p><p>students who boycotted their classes on March 21 </p><p>to protest US killing of Iraqi people are being </p><p>interrogated by the university. Some 40 students </p><p>have been interrogated by the university </p><p>administration as of April 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye: The EU and Turkey\'s Merchants and </p><p>Craftsmen Confederation has started the "Women </p><p>Entrepreneur Support" project. It is gathered </p><p>that five centers have been opened nationwide in </p><p>Ankara, Bursa, Corum, Denizli, and Mersin. The </p><p>aim of the project -- initiated with EU one </p><p>million in February 2003 -- is to provide </p><p>training and consultancy to  women and thus </p><p>support women\'s\' entrepreneurship in the </p><p>selected towns.

Turkiye/Bolge: A 90-person Trade Delegation </p><p>that visited Athens and Thessaloniki announced </p><p>that their visit was a success, and it is </p><p>reported that many of them have already made </p><p>business connections. The President of the </p><p>Chamber of Industry of Adana, Umit Ozgumus, </p><p>announced that they achieved their goals with the </p><p>visit to Greece, during which they had the </p><p>opportunity to meet with hundreds of Greek </p><p>companies on a one-to-one basis. Ozgumus said, </p><p>taking the advantage of proximity, they could </p><p>easily increase their annual volume of trade with </p><p>Greece from existing USD 6 million to USD 60 </p><p>million in a short period of time. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
