<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 000278 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA CROCKER, NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; </p><p>NSC FOR KHALILZAD; </p><p>OSD FOR LUTTI AND HRHODE; </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR WALKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ, PHUM, PREF, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: MASOUD BARZANI IN ANKARA: DESPITE </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN "TONE" OF RELATIONS W/GOT, TURKISH MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE IN NIRAQ UNACCEPTABLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 8041 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Summary and Comment </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/REL UK)  Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Masoud </p><p>Barzani briefed DCM, PolMilCouns, Operation Northern Watch </p><p>POLAD and UK Charge in Ankara Jan. 9 on his Jan. 7-9 meetings </p><p>with Turkish officials.  Barzani said the tone of Turkish </p><p>official interaction had improved significantly this visit </p><p>and had set the stage for the KDP to once again be Turkey\'s </p><p>"good friend and ally" in the region.  However, when the </p><p>subject of possible Turkish military intervention in northern </p><p>Iraq came up, Barzani told us that even if the Turks came as </p><p>part of a US-led coalition, the KDP would object and would </p><p>view the Turks as invaders, not liberators like the US and </p><p>the UK.  He said the aim of a Turkish military presence would </p><p>be to strangle Kurdish aspirations and that once the Turks </p><p>came in large numbers, they would never leave.  The alarming </p><p>problem, Barzani complained, is that if the KDP objects to </p><p>Turkish participation, the Turks will accuse the KDP of being </p><p>ant-coalition and pro-Saddam.  If the KDP acquiesces to </p><p>Turkish participation, the Turkish presence will work </p><p>underground against the KDP.  end Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) KDP leader Masoud Barzani visited Ankara January 7-9 </p><p>for the first time since May 2002.  Barzani was accompanied </p><p>by KDP "Deputy PM" Sami Abdulrahman, Politburo member Azad </p><p>Barwari and KDP Ankara rep Safeen Dizayee.  While in Ankara, </p><p>Barzani met PM Gul, TGS D/CHOD Buyukanit, MFA U/S Ziyal and </p><p>Turkish National Intelligence Organization (TNIO) Chief </p><p>Atasaygun.  Barzani briefed DCM, PolMilCouns, ONW POLAD and </p><p>UK Charge for breakfast Jan. 9, before his meetings with the </p><p>PM and D/CHOD (details of those meetings to be reported </p><p>separately).  Barzani told us he plans to travel from Turkey </p><p>to Damascus Jan. 9 for a two-day visit before returning to </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/REL UK) Comment: The conversation with Barzani </p><p>underscores the urgency of getting the Turks, KDP, PUK and </p><p>appropriate US representatives into the same room at the same </p><p>time to make clear the rules of the road we envision as we </p><p>move forward with our Iraq planning.  Clearly, there will be </p><p>ruffled feathers no matter which way we go.  But better to </p><p>have them ruffled now and work out solutions in advance where </p><p>possible than to deal with the disagreements for the first </p><p>time on the ground in northern Iraq after D-day.  Septel with </p><p>recommendation to follow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>KDP Relations with Turks Improving </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/REL UK) Barzani said that in his meetings with TNIO, </p><p>MFA and TGS 1/7-8 the Turks had displayed a new and improved </p><p>tone toward the KDP.  They told him, "we assure you we have </p><p>no intention of taking Kirkuk or Mosul.  We want to work </p><p>together with you.  We respect the will of the Iraqi people. </p><p>Turkey and the KDP should cooperate."  Barzani replied that </p><p>this position would generate positive steps from the KDP, and </p><p>that if the language of the relationship was that of mutual </p><p>respect and cooperation rather than of threats, the KDP would </p><p>once again be Turkey\'s good friend and ally in the region. </p><p>Barzani emphasized Turkey\'s importance for northern Iraq and </p><p>assured the Turks that the KDP did not seek an independent </p><p>Kurdish entity.  He asked them why they repeatedly accused </p><p>the KDP of seeking one.  The KDP supported the outcome of the </p><p>London opposition conference as an expression of the will of </p><p>the Iraqi people and would work on that basis for all of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/REL UK) Barzani went on to say that post-Saddam Iraq </p><p>should be a place where all people exist on an equal basis </p><p>with protection for the rights of all individuals.  He asked </p><p>the Turks why they believed the KDP oppressed, or would in </p><p>the future oppress, the Iraqi Turkmen.  He again invited the </p><p>GOT to send a parliamentary and/or MFA delegation to northern </p><p>Iraq to investigate the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) accusations </p><p>against the KDP so Turks could see for themselves the ITF </p><p>violations of the law and the rights they enjoy nonetheless. </p><p>Barzani pointed out that at London the KDP had supported </p><p>granting the Iraqi Turkmen Front a second seat on the </p><p>Advisory Committee to avoid hard feelings in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>London a Great Success </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/REL UK) Turning to the London Conference, Barzani </p><p>called it a great success that exceeded his personal </p><p>expectations.  He said the opposition and its friends and </p><p>allies should be extremely satisfied.  "We went in with no </p><p>idea of what we could all unite behind and ended up with </p><p>something very satisfying (the vision statement and the </p><p>political declaration) and with good balance in the </p><p>composition of the Advisory Committee."  Barzani praised both </p><p>the message from the White House following the conference and </p><p>his and Jalal Talabani\'s meeting with UK PM Blair.  He hoped </p><p>the next steps would be as successful as London, and declared </p><p>that since London "the Iraqi regime has given up all hope. </p><p>After the next meeting in Salahadeen on January 20 or 21, </p><p>they\'ll be even more angry and agitated."  He said he </p><p>expected the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS/Mukhabarat) to </p><p>direct terror attacks against the meeting, but was confident </p><p>that the KDP had the security situation on the ground under </p><p>control.  "We are taking all the necessary security </p><p>meansures," he said, but noted that Saddam was "upset and </p><p>sensitive" about the whole opposition project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/REL UK) DCM asked Barzani if Turkey still had concerns </p><p>about the balance of the Advisory Committee.  Barzani said </p><p>they did, mainly about SCIRI/Shia domination.  But, he said, </p><p>the Shia are a majority of the population, some are Turkmen, </p><p>and many are not pro-SCIRI.  The Committee roughly reflects </p><p>the population of Iraq although, he conceeded, no one really </p><p>know the demographics of Iraq today with any certainty. </p><p>Barzani thought the Turks exaggerated the balance issue and </p><p>said the solution is an internationally supervised census </p><p>immediately after Iraq is liberated.  DCM then asked if the </p><p>Turks would support and facilitate access to the Salahadeen </p><p>meeting.  Barzani said that MFA U/S Ziyal had not been </p><p>encouraging, but that Barzani would raise the issue with PM </p><p>Gul later that morning.  Barzani added that Iran and Syria </p><p>had both promised to facilitate the access of the Committee </p><p>to the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Barzani Against Turkish Intervention </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/REL UK) PolMilCouns asked if the Turks had raised any </p><p>military plans.  Here the conversation became heated. </p><p>Barzani said they had been raised in a casual manner and he </p><p>expected more detail when he saw the D/CHOD later in the day. </p><p> Barzani said he had responded clearly that the intervention </p><p>of Turkish forces would lead to disarray and multiple </p><p>problems.  He wondered under what pretext the Turks planned </p><p>to intervene.  If to prevent the establishment of an </p><p>independent Kurdish entity, the KDP would give Turkey a </p><p>guarantee against it.  If to prevent a mass exodus, Barzani </p><p>did not believe it would happen and if it did, the people </p><p>wouldn\'t come to Turkey after their experience from the past. </p><p> And Turkish intervention would draw in the Iranians making </p><p>the region a battlefield for settling old scores.  "Frankly," </p><p>Barzani said, "we and the people of northern Iraq cannot </p><p>tolerate such an intervention." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(S/REL UK) When the Turks asked Barzani whether Turkish </p><p>military presence could be arranged through coordination with </p><p>the KDP, he replied that the KDP had done so in the past for </p><p>operations against the PKK and could do so again if a </p><p>situation arises where Turkish assistance is needed.  Barzani </p><p>pointed out that Turkey already has troops in northern Iraq. </p><p>They are visible and their presence is acceptable.  Anything </p><p>more than what is there now is not acceptable.  If there were </p><p>a decision for Turkish military involvement in northern Iraq, </p><p>he said, that would change the circumstances and balances. </p><p>He said, "Turkish military intervention is a survival matter </p><p>for us.  It would mean that we would fall under Turkish rule. </p><p> If we can\'t stop that from happening, we would leave the </p><p>country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Even in US-Led Coalition </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/REL UK) Even if the Turks came into northern Iraq as </p><p>part of a coalition under US command, Barzani said, in fact </p><p>under any circumstances, increased Turkish military presence </p><p>would be unhelpful.  Barzani pointed to the Turkish-led Peace </p><p>Monitoring Force (PMF -set up in 1997 to monitor the </p><p>cease-fire between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan) as an example of why he does not want more Turkish </p><p>troops there.  "I\'ll tell you clearly what the PMF does: </p><p>everything but mediation between us and the PUK.  They try to </p><p>train and arm the ITF, they take away historical artifacts, </p><p>they engage in drug smuggling and even in assassination </p><p>plots.  And they don\'t leave.  And there are only a few </p><p>hundred of them.  If the US signed a document saying the </p><p>Turks would leave immediately after their tasks were </p><p>complete, we could consider supporting Turkish participation </p><p>in northern Iraq."  Barzani said he would welcome the chance </p><p>to discuss with US officials whether Turkish forces were </p><p>needed in northern Iraq and whether the Turks were open to a </p><p>tripartite (US/TU/KDP-PUK) meeting at any level to discuss </p><p>this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S/REL UK) Barzani, twisting his napkin and becoming </p><p>emotional, continued.  "My position is clear.  Under any </p><p>circumstances, Turkish forces will be considered an invading </p><p>force whether alone or part of a coalition because Turkey\'s </p><p>intent is not to leave.  The aims of a Turkish military </p><p>presence are different from those of US and UK liberators. </p><p>The Turks would be there to strangle Kurdish aspirations.  If </p><p>this comes to pass, we will withdraw from all cooperation." </p><p>He said that US authorities had repeatedly assured him that </p><p>there would be no Turkish forces entering northern Iraq.  "We </p><p>totally dislike the idea of their presence," he said.  DCM </p><p>countered that while we were unaware of any decisions about </p><p>Turkish participation from the US or Turkish sides, we would </p><p>hope that if the Turks were there as part of the effort to </p><p>change the regime in Baghdad the KDP would see Turkish </p><p>participation as part of that effort and support it.  DCM </p><p>urged Barzani to take the issue up further with Presidential </p><p>Special Envoy Khalilzad.  Barzani said he would do so and </p><p>underscored that the alarming consideration for the KDP was </p><p>that although the Turks wanted to be in Iraq for their own </p><p>aims, if the KDP opposed their participation the Turks would </p><p>accuse the KDP of being anti-coalition and pro-Saddam.  and </p><p>if the KDP accepted Turkish participation, the Turks would </p><p>work behind the scenes against the KDP, like they are doing </p><p>in the PMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Emergency Relief Preparations in Northern Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S/REL UK) KDP "Deputy PM" Sami Abdulrahman told us that </p><p>the World Food Program had begun an emergency three-month </p><p>advance distribution of food rations and would foillow this </p><p>with another two-month advance so that the 3.6 million ration </p><p>card holders in northern Iraq would soon have five months of </p><p>food at home.  He said the KDP had spoken at length with </p><p>UNOCHI, NGOS and the ICRC and had done considerable </p><p>contingency planning.  "Relief does not require military </p><p>intervention by Turkish forces," he said. "We\'ve been running </p><p>the administration of the region for ten years and can handle </p><p>an IDP situation."  KDP Ankara rep Dizayee noted that the </p><p>KDP\'s Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance and Cooperation had </p><p>completed a study of contingencies and set up a system for </p><p>implementation.  They would soon send a rep to the embassy in </p><p>ankara to brief us on the plans.  Barzani added that the KDP </p><p>would of course welcome any assistance with the relief </p><p>effort, including joint studies and contributions to their </p><p>system.  But, Barzani said, he believed people would not move </p><p>to northern Iraq in large numbers.  If they did, the KDP </p><p>would welcome them.  But that did not mean the KDP needed </p><p>Turkish forces to be present.  Turkey, he said, was using </p><p>protection of refugees as a pretext for intervention. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
