<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, OES AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>DEPT OF INTERIOR FOR U.S. FISH & WILDLIFE SERVICE </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, PGOV, PTER, EAID, ASEC, SOCI, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST AMBUSH MARS ANNUAL RHINO RELOCATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 498 </p><p> </p><p>This message is sensitive but unclassified.  It is not </p><p>intended for distribution outside official USG channels. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Maoist insurgents killed two Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army soldiers near Royal Chitwan National Park on </p><p>March 10 just hours after the start of the annual </p><p>relocation of rhinos from Chitwan to Royal Bardiya </p><p>National Park.  The subsequent army cordoning of the area </p><p>forced four trucks carrying rhinos to stop by the side of </p><p>the highway for about three hours.  The rhino relocation </p><p>is continuing.  However, the incident again demonstrates </p><p>the wide-ranging disruptions in Nepal caused by the armed </p><p>insurgency and the strain on both civilian government and </p><p>military assets that has resulted from Maoist terror.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The annual rhinoceros relocation from Chitwan to </p><p>Bardiya national parks, held under the auspices of the </p><p>King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) and </p><p>sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund, the U.S. Fish and </p><p>Wildlife Service, and others, began successfully on March </p><p>10 and was proceeding according to plan.  Shortly after </p><p>the first four (out of ten planned) rhinos were crated and </p><p>put on trucks, a Maoist attack killed two Army personnel </p><p>riding in a private truck on the Mugling to Narayangadh </p><p>road.  (Note: although this is part of the main highway </p><p>from Kathmandu to the Indian border, it is a number of </p><p>miles from Chitwan, and not on the route the rhinos were </p><p>taking to Bardiya).  The Army promptly cordoned off the </p><p>entire area around the town of Bharatpur and Chitwan </p><p>National Park, forcing the four trucks carrying the rhinos </p><p>to halt by the side of the road.  The trucks with the </p><p>rhinos were allowed to continue on towards Bardiya </p><p>National Park about three hours later. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The poaching of two rhinos from national parks </p><p>for their horns, valued in tradition Chinese medicine, in </p><p>the previous two weeks had already cast a pall over the </p><p>annual relocation.  King Mahendra Trust director Arup </p><p>Rajouria (whose predecessor is now Nepal\'s Ambassador to </p><p>the U.S.) told us the organizers had even considered </p><p>postponing the operation.  Nevertheless, this year\'s </p><p>relocation attracted a high-level contingent of observers </p><p>from the Government of Nepal, WWF, UNDP, several Kathmandu- </p><p>based embassies (including Ambassadors and Emboffs from </p><p>the U.S., China, Australia, and France) and other </p><p>international organizations.  Many, but not all, of the </p><p>international observers had departed the area by the time </p><p>the attack occurred. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) WWF Nepal head Chandra Gurung told us that his </p><p>delegation had just missed becoming eyewitnesses to the </p><p>attack as they were returning by road to Kathmandu from </p><p>the national park.  According to Gurung, the Maoists </p><p>detonated a device by remote control from some nearby </p><p>hills, then fired on the truck carrying the soldiers.  An </p><p>ensuing firefight produced several more injuries among </p><p>army troops, and some witnesses reported dead or wounded </p><p>insurgents being carried away.  Gurung speculated that the </p><p>Maoists must have had excellent intelligence as well as </p><p>communications ability to be able to target this </p><p>particular unmarked truck -- unless they were actually </p><p>targeting Minister of State for Forests and Conservation </p><p>Hamal, who had passed by the site earlier (unlikely). </p><p>(Note: septel will cover reports that both Hamal and his </p><p>superior, Minister Gopal Man Shrestha, resigned on March </p><p>11 on unrelated corruption allegations).  Gurung confirmed </p><p>that the rhinos did reach Bardiya on the morning of March </p><p>11 and were released as planned, and that the relocation </p><p>project was continuing. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment: The attack in the general area of </p><p>Chitwan -- a magnet for the remaining tourists in Nepal, </p><p>and which had previously been considered relatively safe </p><p>from the threat of Maoist terrorism -- underscores the </p><p>point made in reftel.  The insurgency is straining </p><p>Government of Nepal and Royal Nepalese Army resources, </p><p>causing them to redeploy forces away from environmentally </p><p>sensitive areas like the national parks.  The result has </p><p>been a vacuum that both the Maoist insurgents and criminal </p><p>poachers have rushed to exploit.  In this case, the </p><p>victims have included not only the police and army </p><p>officers assassinated by the Maoists, and Nepal\'s helpless </p><p>civilian population, but also Nepal\'s equally defenseless </p><p>wildlife -- a national treasure and an asset of truly </p><p>global significance.  However, we do not believe that the </p><p>attack was timed to coincide with the rhino relocation. </p><p>The Maoists\' target was, once more, the Royal Nepalese </p><p>Army, not the international observers at the rhino </p><p>relocation event. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
