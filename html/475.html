<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 MADRID 12971 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, KPRP, SP </p><p>SUBJECT: SPAIN: 1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 346420 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS EMBASSY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE </p><p>ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR SPAIN FOR 1991.  RESPONSES ARE </p><p>KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS POSED IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>A. GOS PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2. TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SPAIN INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN 1991, </p><p>LEAVING MORE VICTIMS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN ALL </p><p>OF 1990.  THE TWO MAJOR TERRORIST GROUPS ARE THE EXTREMIST </p><p>BASQUE SEPARATIST GROUP "EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA" (ETA), OR THE </p><p>BASQUE HOMELAND AND LIBERTY MOVEMENT, AND THE SMALLER, RADICAL </p><p>ANTI-CAPITALIST GROUP "FIRST OF OCTOBER ANTI-FASCIST RESISTANCE </p><p>GROUP" (GRAPO).  ETA\'S PRINCIPAL INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION IS TO </p><p>BASQUES RESIDENT IN FRANCE.  THE "ITINERANT COMMAND" WITHIN </p><p>ETA, DISMANTLED IN 1990 THROUGH GOS/GOF COOPERATION, WAS </p><p>COMPOSED OF FRENCH BASQUES OR SPANISH BASQUE RESIDENTS IN </p><p>FRANCE.  ETA BRANCHED OUT IN 1991 FROM 1989-90 ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>SPANISH RELATED TARGETS IN THE NETHERLANDS TO TARGETS IN ITALY </p><p>AND GERMANY.  WHEN THE ITALIAN TERRORIST GROUP "FALANGE ARMADA" </p><p>CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR 1991 BOMBINGS IN ROME AND MILAN, IT </p><p>SAID THAT IT ACTED ON ETA\'S BEHALF.  GRAPO ALSO HAS CONTACTS </p><p>WITH FRANCE, AND SOME OF ITS LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>RESIDENT THERE. </p><p> </p><p>3. TWO SMALLER SPANISH TERRORIST GROUPS WERE ALSO ACTIVE IN </p><p>1991:  THE BASQUE ANTI-CAPITALIST TERRORIST GROUP "IRAULTZA," </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN DORMANT FOR SOME MONTHS (AND WHICH HAS TARGETED </p><p>AMERICAN BUSINESSES IN THE PAST), AND THE GUERRILLA ARMY OF THE </p><p>FREE GALICIAN PEOPLE (EGPGC).   A THIRD TERRORIST GROUP, "TERRA </p><p>LLIURE," A SMALL CATALAN SEPARATIST GROUP ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>WEAKENED, PUBLICLY RENOUNCED THE USE OF TERRORISM IN 1991 AND </p><p>AFFILIATED ITSELF WITH A SMALL REGIONALIST PARTY.  IT MAY </p><p>DEVELOP NON-VIOLENT PROTESTS DURING THE OLYMPIC GAME PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE "GAL" (ANTI-TERRORIST LIBERATION GROUP) TRIAL OF TWO </p><p>EX-NATIONAL POLICE OFFICIALS FOR ORGANIZING ASSASSINATIONS OF </p><p>ETA MEMBERS IN FRANCE CONCLUDED THIS SUMMER, WITH BOTH MEN </p><p>RECEIVING STIFF PRISON SENTENCES, EACH TOTALLING OVER 100 </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>5. PRE-TRIAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE PROCEEDING AGAINST A NUMBER OF </p><p>JAILED DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS; BUT THE CRIMINAL </p><p>PROSECUTION PROCESS TENDS TO BE SLOW.  SPANISH LAW AUTHORIZES </p><p>PREVENTIVE DETENTION OF ALLEGED TERRORISTS FOR UP TO TWO YEARS </p><p>AND AN EXTENSION OF TWO YEARS UPON A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF </p><p>PROBABLE CAUSE, WHILE INVESTIGATIONS ARE PROCEEDING.  THE GAL </p><p>DEFENDANTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE UNDER DETENTION FOR THREE YEARS </p><p>BEFORE THEIR TRIAL.  SPANISH PROSECUTORS ALSO ROUTINELY SEEK </p><p>LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES; BUT THE MAXIMUM TIME SERVED, EVEN IN </p><p>CONVICTIONS FOR MULTIPLE CRIMES, CANNOT BE MORE THAN 30 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>B. GOS EXTRADITIONS AND EXTRADITION REQUESTS </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - </p><p> </p><p>6. ETA TERRORISTS RESIDE IN MANY COUNTRIES, AMONG THEM CAPE </p><p>VERDE, CUBA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, FRANCE, SAO TOME </p><p>E PRINCIPE, AND VENEZUELA.  OFTEN, THEY RESIDE ABROAD IN EXILE </p><p>BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SPAIN AND HOST GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7. DURING 1991, THE GOS CONTINUED ITS VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO </p><p>EXTRADITE ETA TERRORISTS FROM ABROAD, ESPECIALLY FROM FRANCE, </p><p>BUT WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.  PROCEDURAL EXTRADITION PROBLEMS </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOF AND GOS CONTINUED TO HAMPER BILATERAL </p><p>COOPERATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, A PROCEDURAL ERROR REQUIRED THE GOF </p><p>TO RELEASE AN ETA OPERATIVE, ANTONIO GABIOLA GOYOGANA, IN </p><p>JULY.  THE MAY 1990 EXTRADITION FROM FRANCE OF JOSE RAMON </p><p>MARTINEZ DE LA PUENTE CONTINUES TO BE THE SOLE EXTRADITION FROM </p><p>FRANCE OF A RELATIVELY HIGH RANKING ETA MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION </p><p>- - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>8. THE PRINCIPAL IMPEDIMENT TO EXTRADITION FROM SPAIN IS THAT </p><p>EXTRADITION WILL NOT BE GRANTED IF THE PERSON WOULD BE SUBJECT </p><p>TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  THIS PROBLEM IS HANDLED BY AN </p><p>UNDERTAKING FROM THE REQUESTING COUNTRY THAT THE DEATH PENALTY </p><p>WILL NOT BE SOUGHT IN THE CASE IN QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>D. OTHER RESPONSES TO COMBAT TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>9. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT STRONGLY AND CONSISTENTLY OPPOSES </p><p>TERRORISM, EVEN WHEN USED TO COMBAT TERRORISM, AS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>BY THE GAL PROSECUTION.   TERRORIST ACTS ARE VEHEMENTLY, </p><p>UNAMBIGUOUSLY, AND REPEATEDLY CONDEMNED BY HIGH RANKING GOS </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>10. SPAIN IS NOT ONLY CONTINUING ITS STRONG CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM, BUT HAS STEPPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM READINESS.  THE GOS RECOGNIZES THAT THERE </p><p>WILL BE AN INCREASED RISK OF TERRORISM IN 1992 DIRECTED AGAINST </p><p>THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BARCELONA AND ITS SATELLITE LOCATIONS, THE </p><p>WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE, AND EVENTS CELEBRATING THE DISCOVERY </p><p>OF THE AMERICAS. </p><p> </p><p>11. THE GOS IS CONTINUING ITS POLICY OF DISPERSING ETA AND </p><p>GRAPO PRISONERS, TO ISOLATE THEM FROM SUPPORTERS AND MAKE </p><p>RESCUE ATTEMPTS MORE DIFFICULT.   ETA AND GRAPO HAVE RESPONDED </p><p>BY STEPPING UP ATTACKS AGAINST PRISON AUTHORITIES.  IN 1991, </p><p>GRAPO ASSASSINATED A DOCTOR WHO TREATED GRAPO PRISONERS ON </p><p>HUNGER STRIKE. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE GOS IS ALSO CONTINUING ITS REINSERTION PROGRAM, UNDER </p><p>WHICH A PRISONER CONVICTED OF TERRORISM MAY RECEIVE LIMITED </p><p>IMMUNITY IF HE RENOUNCES THE USE OF FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE GOS HAS MADE JUDICIAL REFORM ONE OF ITS PRIORITIES AND </p><p>HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO STRENGTHEN THE CRIMINAL CODE.  ONE NEW </p><p>PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE ANYONE CONVICTED OF TERRORISM TO </p><p>COMPLETE HIS/HER FULL SENTENCE, WITH NO TIME OFF FOR GOOD </p><p>BEHAVIOR.  BECAUSE OF THE 30-YEAR LIMITATION ON PRISON </p><p>SENTENCES SERVED, THE MAJOR IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE WOULD FALL ON </p><p>THOSE RECEIVING SHORTER SENTENCES, SUCH AS MINOR ACCOMPLICES, </p><p>DISCOURAGING ASSISTANCE TO TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>14. SPANISH LAW PROHIBITS THE PAYMENT OF RANSOM TO TERRORISTS, </p><p>CONSIDERING SUCH PAYMENT COLLABORATION.  ONE BUSINESSMAN </p><p>KIDNAPPED IN LATE 1990 WAS RELEASED BY ETA IN FEBRUARY 1991, </p><p>REPORTEDLY UPON PAYMENT OF A RANSOM BY HIS FAMILY, BUT NO </p><p>PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED, UNLIKE A SIMILAR CASE IN </p><p>1990. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OF 1991 </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>15. SPAIN COORDINATES ITS COUNTERTERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGH </p><p>THE EC\'S TREVI GROUP AND BILATERALLY WITH MANY NATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE U.S.  BILATERAL ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION WITH </p><p>FRANCE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AND HAS DELIVERED SOME IMPORTANT </p><p>SUCCESSES AGAINST ETA IN FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>16. DOMESTICALLY, GOS EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON ETA, AS THE MOST </p><p>SOPHISTICATED AND LETHAL OF THE DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS, AND </p><p>GRAPO.  AS IN 1990, COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL POLICE AND </p><p>CIVIL GUARD CONTINUES TO BE A GOS FOCUS FOR IMPROVEMENT.  ONE </p><p>STEP IN THIS DIRECTION IN 1991 WAS TO RESTRUCTURE THE CIVIL </p><p>GUARD TO MORE CLOSELY PARALLEL THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>17. IN THE SUMMER OF 1991, ETA AGAIN ANNOUNCED A BOMBING </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST DESIGNATED RAIL LINES, IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>DISRUPT HOLIDAY TRAVEL EMBARRASS THE GOS.  THE GOS MOVED </p><p>QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO AVOID PUBLIC PANIC AND LIMIT </p><p>INCONVENIENCE, ALTHOUGH THIS REQUIRED A HEAVY COMMITMENT OF </p><p>PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES.  THREE BOMBS EXPLODED ON RAILWAY </p><p>LINES, WITH LIGHT MATERIAL AND NO HUMAN CASUALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>18. DURING THE GULF WAR, THE GOS TOOK IMMEDIATE STEPS TO </p><p>INCREASE SECURITY AROUND HIGH RISK TARGETS AND DISCOURAGE ANY </p><p>ATTEMPTED MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN.  THE </p><p>GOS ALSO TOOK SIMILAR SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROVIDE SECURITY </p><p>DURING THE 1991 MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE IN MADRID. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>F. GOS SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>19. THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, FINANCIALLY OR DIPLOMATICALLY, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID, BUT THAT OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  IN THE UNITED NATIONS, THE GOS HAS OPPOSED </p><p>OBSERVER STATUS FOR THE PLO, AND THE GOS ENFORCES EC SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>20. THE GOES DOES NOT ISSUE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>TERRORISM OR OF TERRORIST SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>H. CHANGES IN SPANISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>21. THE AWARENESS OF THE THREAT POSED BY MIDDLE EASTERN </p><p>TERRORISTS GREW IN 1991, AS SPAIN PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST IRAQI AGGRESSION AND HOSTED THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CASEY </p><p></p></div>
