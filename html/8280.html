<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE NEGATIVE COMMENTARY IN GOVERNMENT MEDIA </p><p>TO POWELL-NCUBE MEETING </p><p> </p><p>1. Under the headline "Archbishop Ncube shameless" the </p><p>government-controlled daily "Herald\'s" May 24 editorial </p><p>criticized Archbishop Pius Ncube for meeting with </p><p>Secretary Powell. Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>2. "Like the proverbial Judas Iscariot, Roman Catholic </p><p>Archbishop Pius Ncube was in Washington on Tuesday to </p><p>sacrifice his country to the altar of the mighty U.S. </p><p>and to be thanked by the Americans for being in tune </p><p>with their grand plans on Zimbabwe. . .  Instead of </p><p>reporting to God, who is his Master, he now reports to </p><p>the American Government.  He shamelessly scurries to </p><p>the imperial master for advice and guidance on how to </p><p>deal with the Zimbabwean government.  Archbishop Ncube </p><p>knows that Colin Powell wields enough power to order </p><p>the overthrow of a government as the Americans have </p><p>already done in Afghanistan and Iraq. . .  Instead of </p><p>seeking God\'s intervention for whatever he believes </p><p>needs to be solved in Zimbabwe, Archbishop Ncube has </p><p>gone to the U.S. for them to do to Zimbabwe what Pilate </p><p>and Herod did to Jesus Christ.  The Archbishop knows </p><p>very well that the American Government has no higher </p><p>moral ground than anyone else on human rights or the </p><p>rule of law as its track record in Iraq, Afghanistan or </p><p>the U.S. is atrocious. . .  It would have been </p><p>understandable if the Archbishop was called to the </p><p>Vatican to be thanked by the Pope for standing up to </p><p>what he believes to be right.  He has lost the dignity </p><p>and sanctity of the cloth he wears. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
