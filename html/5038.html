<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, EAID, BM, JP </p><p>SUBJECT: JAPAN EXPANDS DEBT RELIEF; AGREES TO HOST </p><p>CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON BURMA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Japan has agreed to host a consultative group </p><p>meeting on Burma in mid-February.  It is also edging towards </p><p>support for economic reform in Burma.  How far it can or </p><p>should go in that regard, absent real political reform, will </p><p>likely be one of the prime topics at the February meeting. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Consultative Group Meeting </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Japanese Government has agreed to host a </p><p>consultative group meeting on Burma in mid-February. </p><p>According to Japanese Embassy sources, the agenda will </p><p>include political transition, economic reform and human </p><p>rights issues.  The Japanese may also take advantage of the </p><p>meeting to present a summary of the economic reform </p><p>recommendations that have emerged from their Structural </p><p>Adjustment Project.  The Thai and Indian Embassies have both </p><p>told us that their governments plan to attend. </p><p> </p><p>Structural Adjustment Program </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The latest workshop on the Japanese Structural </p><p>Adjustment Program was held December 21 and 22.  David Abel </p><p>headed the Burmese side; a Japanese academic (Professor </p><p>Odaka) headed the Japanese.  The Burmese accepted the </p><p>Japanese recommendations, including currency unification, but </p><p>argued as usual that they needed time and financing support </p><p>for major adjustments.  The Japanese also pushed the idea of </p><p>"special zones" for industry and agriculture within which </p><p>some of the GOB\'s regulations might be lifted.  Again, the </p><p>Burmese accepted the idea, but made no commitments on </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The next step will be a government-to-government </p><p>meeting (as opposed to the latest workshop, which was billed </p><p>as an academic exchange) probably in early March to work on </p><p>an implementation plan for the proposed reforms. At that </p><p>point, Japanese Embassy sources indicated, they will have to </p><p>talk about programs of financial support. </p><p> </p><p>Debt Relief </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Japanese government will provide Burma with debt </p><p>relief equivalent to about 150 billion yen ($1.3 billion) </p><p>under a program that will be implemented starting in February </p><p>2004 and which will cover all maturities coming due after </p><p>April 2003.  According to the Embassy, the program will not </p><p>cover arrears to Japan, which, in Burma\'s case, are now </p><p>equivalent to about $2 billion.  Those arrears will still be </p><p>available for use as leverage in encouraging economic reform. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The program is not specific to Burma, although Burma </p><p>is easily the largest beneficiary.  The debts of a whole </p><p>variety of heavily-indebted states, totaling about 900 </p><p>billion yen, will be forgiven under the program.  There is </p><p>also no connection to political developments in Burma. </p><p>According to Japanese Embassy sources, the new debt relief </p><p>initiative was the product of a general review of Japanese </p><p>debt relief practices.  Previously, the Japanese had forgiven </p><p>debt on an annual basis by providing matching grants for any </p><p>debt service paid by heavily-indebted countries.  However, </p><p>asking countries to come up with the debt payments before </p><p>relief could be granted made the whole program dependent on </p><p>recipient nations\' cash flow.  Whenever recipient nations had </p><p>cash flow problems; i.e., whenever they needed the relief </p><p>most, the whole program broke down.  The new approach will </p><p>avoid those problems. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Japanese are obviously edging towards support for </p><p>economic reform in Burma.  They will want to talk about this </p><p>at the Consultative Group meeting in February and will likely </p><p>argue that it is time to move beyond humanitarian assistance </p><p>and the treatment of symptoms in Burma to the treatment of </p><p>root causes.  That in turn could set the stage for a debate </p><p>as to whether anything can or should be done to treat these </p><p>problems absent real political reform. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
