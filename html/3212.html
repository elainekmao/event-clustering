COVERAGE OF </p><p>REACTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE EAST SPEECH </p><p>REFLECTED POSITIVE COMMENTS FROM ARAB OFFICIALS, AND </p><p>CRITICISM FROM ALL OTHER QUARTERS, INCLUDING AMERICAN </p><p>AND BRITISH COMMENTATORS. </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN EDITORIAL COLUMNISTS CONTINUED TO CRITICIZE </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE EAST SPEECH, CHARGING THAT IT </p><p>IGNORED THE ARAB INITIATIVE AND ARAB DIPLOMACY, AND </p><p>THAT IT HAS PUT ARAB MODERATES AND THE ISRAELI PEACE </p><p>CAMP IN A VERY EMBARRASSING POSITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES THIS MORNING COVERED DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>THE WEST BANK WITH HEADLINES SUCH AS: "A MILLION </p><p>PALESTINIANS UNDER CURFEW" IN THE INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM, AND: "PITCHED </p><p>BATTLES IN HEBRON AND LARGE WAVE OF ARRESTS IN THE WEST </p><p>BANK" IN THE SEMI-OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL- </p><p>RAI.  CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR </p><p>LED WITH THE HEADLINE: "BUSH: NO AID TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WITHOUT REFORMS." </p><p> </p><p>COVERAGE OF REACTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE EAST </p><p>SPEECH VARIED BETWEEN POSITIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS BY ARAB </p><p>OFFICIALS, AND CRITICISM FROM OTHER SOURCES.  THE </p><p>CONTRAST WAS MANIFEST IN TWO ADJACENT STORIES IN AL- </p><p>RAI.  THE HEADLINE OF THE FIRST READ: "AMR MUSSA: BUSH </p><p>DID NOT CALL FOR GETTING RID OF ARAFAT" WHILE THE </p><p>HEADLINE NEXT TO IT READ: "EUROPEAN UNION AND CANADA </p><p>CRITICIZE BUSH\'S CALL FOR GETTING RID OF ARAFAT." </p><p> </p><p>AL-DUSTOUR AND AL-ARAB AL-YAWM REPORTED ON THEIR FRONT </p><p>PAGES THE ARREST IN THE U.S. OF A JORDANIAN WHO HAD </p><p>SHARED RESIDENCE WITH TWO OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>HIJACKERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARY </p><p>-- BUSH IGNORES THE ARAB INITIATIVE </p><p>MOST WIDELY READ JORDANIAN COLUMNIST DR. FAHED AL-FANEK </p><p>WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI </p><p>ON JUNE 27: "THE REFORMS THAT BUSH ASKED EXCLUSIVELY OF </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS ARE CORRECT, AND IN FACT THEY ARE </p><p>DEMANDED BY THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  BUT IN REALITY </p><p>BUSH IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THEM BECAUSE THE U.S. IS IN </p><p>THE HABIT OF DEALING AND MAKING ALLIANCE WITH THE WORST </p><p>DICTATORIAL CORRUPT REGIMES. IN FACT, PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>ASKED CERTAIN RULERS TO HELP IMPLEMENT POLITICAL AND </p><p>FISCAL REFORMS IN PALESTINE THAT THEY DO NOT CARRY OUT </p><p>IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. THE OTHER POINT IS THAT THE </p><p>LEADERS OF JORDAN, EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA MADE SEVERAL </p><p>VISITS TO WASHINGTON AND SPENT LONG HOURS WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE ARAB POINT OF VIEW, AND </p><p>THEY RETURNED OPTIMISTIC THINKING THAT THEY MANAGED TO </p><p>INFLUENCE HIS THINKING, ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD </p><p>CLOSED HIS EYES AND EARS TO THEM BECAUSE HE IS </p><p>COMMITTED TO SHARON\'S VISION." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IGNORING THE ARAB INITIATIVE </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAHMOUD AL-RIMAWI WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JUNE 27: </p><p>"DESPITE THE FREQUENT MEETINGS THAT PRESIDENT BUSH MADE </p><p>WITH ARAB LEADERS, AND WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PUBLICIZED </p><p>ABOUT A POSITIVE SPIRIT IN THESE MEETINGS THAT WERE </p><p>HELD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE </p><p>AMERICAN HAWKS, WHO SHOULD BETTER BE DESCRIBES AND THE </p><p>AMERICAN LIKUD, WERE DOING ALL THAT THEY COULD TO MAKE </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION\'S VIEWS COMPATIBLE WITH THOSE OF THE </p><p>OCCUPATION GOVERNMENT IN TEL AVIV.  THIS IS THE GREAT </p><p>DANGER OF THE SPEECH. ONE NEEDS TO BE AN IMBECILE TO </p><p>BELIEVE AND TRUST THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE SHOULD START WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>ITS NUCLEUS WHILE CLOSING THE DOOR AGAINST SERIOUS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SYRIAN AND LEBANESE TRACKS.  ARABS </p><p>ARE NOW CALLED UPON TO MOBILIZE THEMSELVES TO END THIS </p><p>SAGA THAT USES THE PRETEXT OF FIGHTING TERRORISM TO </p><p>PREVENT PEACE AND ABET THE STATE TERRORISM THAT IS </p><p>BEING PRACTICED BY THE WAR CRIMINALS OF TEL AVIV." </p><p> </p><p>-- ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK </p><p>PROMINENT JORDANIAN COLUMNIST URAIB RANTAWI WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON </p><p>JUNE 27: THE TONGUE [THAT UTTERED THE SPEECH] BELONGED </p><p>TO PRESIDENT BUSH, BUT THE HAND [THAT WROTE IT] WAS </p><p>THAT OF SHARON, TO THE POINT THAT SHARON COULD EASILY </p><p>CLAIM COPYRIGHT OF THIS SPEECH.  PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>SPEECH IS A PERSONAL DEFEAT FOR ARAFAT, AND A STAB FOR </p><p>ARAB DIPLOMACY.  NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IGNORED COMPLETELY </p><p>THE INITIATIVE OF PRICE ABDULLAH AND THE BEIRUT </p><p>DECLARATION, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT ADOPTED THE ISRAELI </p><p>VERSION FROM A TO Z, AND REFUSED TO COMMIT ITSELF TO </p><p>ANY ARAB RIGHTS OF INTERESTS.  THE NET RESULT IS THAT </p><p>BUSH HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR ESCALATING THE CRISIS </p><p>RATHER THAN SOLVING IT.  HE HAS GIVEN FRESH IMPETUS FOR </p><p>EXTREMISTS IN THE REGION, MADE THE LIFE OF ARAB </p><p>MODERATES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, WEAKENED THE PNA IN </p><p>FAVOR OF ITS RIVALS, GIVEN SHARON AND THE RIGHT-WING </p><p>CAMP A NEW LEASE OF LIFE, AND PLACED THE ISRAELI PEACE </p><p>CAMP UNDER SIEGE." </p><p> </p><p>-- WHERE IS THE ISRAELI PEACE PARTNER? </p><p>TAHER AL-ADWAN, CHIEF EDITOR OF INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM WROTE ON JUNE 27: </p><p>"PRESIDENT BUSH\'S SPEECH CONTAINS MANY ERRORS, THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT OF WHICH WAS TO PORTRAY THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND ITS PRESIDENT, ARAFAT, AS UNFIT TO BE A </p><p>PARTNER IN MAKING PEACE, EVEN THOUGH ARAFAT HAS A NOBEL </p><p>PEACE PRIZE, AND HE WAS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN LEADER TO </p><p>SHAKE HANDS WITH ISRAELI LEADERS AND TO RECOGNIZE </p><p>ISRAEL. IF PRESIDENT BUSH WERE BALANCED, HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>CALLED FOR A CHANGE IN THE ISRAELI LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE </p><p>EVEN ISRAELIS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHARON WAS A VOICE </p><p>AGAINST EVERY PEACE TREATY WITH EVERY ARAB COUNTRY, AND </p><p>HE IS AN EXPERT OF CRIMINALITY, MASSACRES, AND </p><p>DESTRUCTION. BUT BUSH CHOSE NOT TO BE BALANCED, AND HIS </p><p>VIEWS WILL PASS AS DUST, THE SAME AS THE DUST RAISED BY </p><p>THE CHAINS OF SHARON\'S TANKS."  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
