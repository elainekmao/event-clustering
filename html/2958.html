BOTH READ-OUTS WERE CONSISTENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02413  161519Z </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE QUARTET </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PERES STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEWLY FORMED </p><p>QUARTET.  HE UNDERLINED THAT THE "HARMONIZATION" BETWEEN THE </p><p>FOUR, AND ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE US AND THE EU, IS KEY TO </p><p>SOLVING THE CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  BERLUSCONI SAID HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED PERES\' MESSAGE ON THE NEED TO </p><p>COORDINATE EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH THE US, THAT HE HAS AN </p><p>EXCELLENT RELATION WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT HE PLANS TO </p><p>RAISE THE MIDDLE EAST ISSUE WITH BUSH ON MAY 27 IN ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ISRAEL\'S DEMANDS OF ARAFAT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PERES STATED THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DEMANDS A </p><p>100% EFFORT FROM ARAFAT TO STOP THE VIOLENCE AND TERROR </p><p>WITHOUT EXPECTING 100% RESULTS.  IN ADDITION TO A CEASE-FIRE, </p><p>THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS ASKING ARAFAT TO CREATE A CENTRAL </p><p>COMMAND OF ALL ARMED MILITIAS IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES </p><p>SO THAT THE ISRAELIS WOULD HAVE A SINGLE RATHER THAN MANY </p><p>COUNTERPARTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A PEACE CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.

THIS CONFERENCE, HE </p><p>ADDED, OUGHT TO BE LED BY THE QUARTET TO ADDRESS LESS "THE </p><p>MEANS TOWARDS PEACE" AND MORE THE "CHARACTER" OF PEACE.  SOME </p><p>ARAB STATES SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE CONFERENCE BUT NOT </p><p>SYRIA, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PERES, IS NOT "READY" YET.  ALL </p><p>THE DIFFERENT PLANS OUGHT TO BE DISCUSSED: THE SAUDI PLAN, </p><p>THE TENET/MITCHELL PLAN, AND THE PERES/ABU ALAA DOCUMENT. </p><p>BERLUSCONI REPEATED HIS DESIRE TO HOST THE PEACE CONFERENCE </p><p>IN ROME.  PERES APPROVED OF ROME AS THE CONFERENCE LOCATION </p><p>FOR ITS SUITABLE POLITICAL CLIMATE, ITS GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>PROXIMITY, AND ITS EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH BOTH SIDES.  HE </p><p>ADDED HOWEVER THAT THE FINAL DECISION OF LOCATION BELONGS TO </p><p>THE US AND THAT THE GOI OUGHT TO DISCUSS IT DIRECTLY WITH THE </p><p>USG IF IT WANTS TO HOST THE CONFERENCE IN ROME.  BOTH PERES </p><p>AND BERLUSCONI AGREED THAT THE CONFERENCE SHOULD TAKE PLACE </p><p>WITHIN TWO MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ISRAEL\'S VIEW OF ITALY\'S ROLE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WHEN ASKED HOW THE GOI COULD HELP THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, PERES ANSWERED: </p><p>BY "HARMONIZING" THE EU/US EFFORTS, PURSUING AN ECONOMIC </p><p>ASSISTANCE PLAN FOR THE REGION, AND SUPPORTING THE IDEA OF A </p><p>PEACE CONFERENCE BY THE END OF JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A LOOK TO THE FUTURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02413  161519Z </p><p>6. (C) PERES SAID THAT THE PALESTINIANS HAVE A PRESIDENT BUT </p><p>NOT A LEADER IN ARAFAT.  HE STRESSED THAT ISRAEL SUPPORTS UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS 242 AND 338 BUT THAT A RETURN TO THE PRE 1967 </p><p>BORDERS WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION BECAUSE OF ISRAEL\'S SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02413 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
