<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000695 </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NEC/GSPERLING AND NSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  APEC, ECON, OPDC, BX </p><p>OVIP (CLINTON, WILLIAM J.) </p><p>SUBJECT: SULTAN OF BRUNEI\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON CONCERNING APEC </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS AN ADVANCE COPY OF SULTAN </p><p>HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH\'S LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>REGARDING THE AGENDA FOR THE NOVEMBER 15-16 APEC </p><p>LEADERS MEETING IN BRUNEI. WE EXPECT THAT BRUNEI </p><p>EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON WILL DELIVER THE ORIGINAL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT OF SULTAN\'S LETTER. </p><p> </p><p>YOUR EXCELLENCY, </p><p> </p><p>I AM VERY PLEASED THAT YOU WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>THE INFORMAL APEC ECONOMIC LEADERS\' MEETING IN </p><p>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN ON 15-16 NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>WE WILL GATHER AGAIN THIS YEAR HAVING FURTHER </p><p>CONSOLIDATED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HAVING </p><p>CONTINUED THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL REFORM </p><p>SO IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF ALL ECONOMIES IN </p><p>THE REGION.  OUR FINANCE MINISTERS, AT THEIR MEETING </p><p>IN BRUNEI DARUSSALAM IN SEPTEMBER, HAVE CAUTIONED </p><p>AGAINST COMPLACENCY IN THESE EFFORTS AND HAVE DRAWN </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE KEY ISSUES NEEDED TO SECURE </p><p>FINANCIAL STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, </p><p>AND TO THE POTENTIAL RISKS AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>THESE ISSUES ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF MANAGING GLOBALISATION WHICH I BELIEVE IS </p><p>THE MAJOR CHALLENGE BEFORE US AT THIS TIME.  I AM </p><p>THEREFORE SUGGESTING THAT THIS BE THE SUBJECT OF OUR </p><p>RETREAT ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.  I WOULD BE </p><p>MOST GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD BE ONE OF THE LEAD </p><p>SPEAKERS ON THIS TOPIC.  I KNOW THAT SOME LEADERS </p><p>MAY ALSO WANT TO RAISE THEIR CONCERNS OVER </p><p>INSTABILITY IN THE PRICE OF OIL AND I PROPOSE THAT </p><p>THIS BE DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MORNING RETREAT. </p><p>I OUTLINED SOME OF THE ISSUES WHICH I THOUGHT WERE </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR OUR DISCUSSION ON GLOBALIZATION AND </p><p>ITS STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH INFORMATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN MY EARLIER LETTER TO YOU </p><p>AND I AM ENCOURAGED BY POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM </p><p>LEADERS.  OUR OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO BEEN PREPARING </p><p>BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR US FOR THIS DISCUSSION WHICH </p><p>SHOWS SOME OF APEC\'S KEY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>SUCCESSES IN GLOBALIZATION AND SOME OF THE ISSUES </p><p>FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF MANY </p><p>FORUMS THIS YEAR, I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE APEC BRINGS </p><p>TOGETHER A DIVERSE RANGE OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING </p><p>ECONOMIES, WE ARE IN A POSITION TO SHOW LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND MAKE A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION.  WE SHOULD BE </p><p>STRIVING TO SHOW OUR COMMUNITIES THAT APEC\'S </p><p>BALANCED AGENDA OF MARKET OPENING AND CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING CAN MAKE GLOBALISATION AND THE REVOLUTION </p><p>IN TECHNOLOGY AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS WHICH, WHEN </p><p>EFFECTIVELY MANAGED, WILL PROVIDE GROWTH AND HIGHER </p><p>LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL SECTIONS OF OUR ECONOMIES. </p><p>WE SHOULD BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BUT IT </p><p>IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE WITH A </p><p>CREDIBLE COURSE OF ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS RESPECT, I AM PLEASED TO LEARN FROM MY </p><p>OFFICIALS THAT MANY ECONOMIES HAVE OFFERED TO </p><p>INITIATE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>CAPACITY OF OUR ECONOMIES TO TAKE UP THE ADVANTAGES </p><p>OF GLOBALIZATION.  THESE PROGRAMS, DESIGNED TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE, OUR MARKETS AND OUR </p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES, GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE </p><p>INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AS THE </p><p>CONDUIT TO THE SO-CALLED NEW ECONOMY.  TOGETHER THEY </p><p>PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR TAKING CAPACITY BUILDING AND </p><p>COMMERCE TO THE WIDEST SPECTRUM OF OUR ECONOMIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES WHO ARE YET </p><p>TO SEE THE FULL BENEFITS. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MORNING SESSION AND AN INFORMAL </p><p>LUNCHEON WHERE COLLEAGUES WILL BE FREE TO DISCUSS </p><p>ISSUES AMONG THEMSELVES, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE </p><p>CONTINUE OUR RETREAT FOCUSING ON THE WTO AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>AS A REGION, OUR STAKE IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADING </p><p>SYSTEM HAS PERHAPS NEVER BEEN GREATER.  I AM SURE </p><p>THEREFORE THAT WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK </p><p>OF PROGRESS IN THE WTO AND WILL WANT TO STRESS IN </p><p>CLEAR TERMS THE IMPORTANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHING </p><p>OF A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>OUR DISCUSSIONS WILL ENABLE US TO SHARE VIEWS ON </p><p>WAYS IN WHICH APEC CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PROGRESS AND </p><p>HOW WE CAN COOPERATE IN CAPACITY BUILDING TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE AND </p><p>DETERMINATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE AFTERNOON RETREAT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN IDEAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXCHANGE VIEWS INFORMALLY ON </p><p>THE NATURE AND RATIONALE OF EMERGING REGIONAL </p><p>TRADING ARRANGEMENTS.  I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS </p><p>DISCUSSION TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING SO THAT WE CAN </p><p>DEVELOP A CLEARER PICTURE OF HOW SUCH ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>WILL HELP ADVANCE OUR COMMON GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>I KNOW THAT ABAC HAS BEEN DISCUSSING BOTH </p><p>GLOBALISATION AND TRADE ISSUES THIS YEAR AND I </p><p>EXPECT THAT OUR DIALOGUE WITH ABAC MEMBERS ON THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF 15 NOVEMBER WILL ENRICH OUR RETREAT </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  SEVERAL LEADERS WILL ALSO BE </p><p>INTERACTING WITH BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES AT THE CEO </p><p>SUMMIT ON 14-15 NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE </p><p>ART EXHIBITION BY YOUNG ARTISTS FROM OUR APEC </p><p>ECONOMIES.  YOUR VIEWING OF THE EXHIBITION AND </p><p>INTERACTION WITH THE ARTISTS AFTER THE CLOSE OF OUR </p><p>MEETINGS ON 15 NOVEMBER WILL SEND AN ENCOURAGING </p><p>SIGNAL TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE VALUE WE PLACE </p><p>ON MAINTAINING CULTURAL IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION IN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF COMMUNITY BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LAST 10 YEARS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED MANY OF THE </p><p>CHALLENGES AHEAD AND HAVE BEGUN OUR PREPARATIONS. </p><p>GIVEN THE TASK AHEAD AND WIDESPREAD CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE FUTURE, I BELIEVE THAT THE LEADERS\' DECLARATION </p><p>SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR AND DECISIVE VISION OF THE </p><p>FUTURE AND ONE WHICH WILL GIVE GREATER CONFIDENCE TO </p><p>ALL PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>I LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO WELCOMING YOU IN BRUNEI </p><p>DARUSSALAM NEXT MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>YOURS SINCERELY, </p><p>///// </p><p>SULTAN HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH </p><p>OF BRUNEI </p><p> </p><p>END OF TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>STANFIELD </p><p></p></div>
