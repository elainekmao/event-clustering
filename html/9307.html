The commission </p><p>is to investigate the detention of Turkish special </p><p>forces in the Northern Iraqi town of Suleymaniye last </p><p>weekend.  The Turks have asked General Sylvester to </p><p>sack Colonel Bill Mayville, and presented him with </p><p>evidence on alleged U.S. ties to PKK/KADEK.  General </p><p>Sylvester will proceed to Northern Iraq on Thursday, </p><p>and return to Ankara this weekend.  Papers expect the </p><p>U.S. and Turkish sides to issue a joint statement </p><p>outlining principles for future military operations in </p><p>Northern Iraq.  The U.S. side has conveyed to Ankara </p><p>its concerns over the cache of arms kept by Turkish </p><p>units in Northern Iraq, which included a considerable </p><p>amount of C-4 explosives.  "Radikal" reports that U.S. </p><p>officers in Northern Iraq accuse the 11 detained </p><p>Turkish soldiers of belonging to a "terror unit" </p><p>involved in illegal activities. The underlying reason </p><p>for the arrests, "Radikal" reports based on AKP </p><p>sources, is that the U.S. wants Turkey out of Northern </p><p>Iraq.  Ankara has refused to pull back its troops, and </p><p>has demanded written guarantees from the U.S. that </p><p>PKK/KADEK activities and a sovereign Kurdish state </p><p>would be prevented.  "Radikal" believes the arrests to </p><p>be part of a regional policy pursued by the U.S. </p><p>Administration, and expects the Americans to continue </p><p>narrowing Turkey\'s room for maneuver in the region. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports a senior U.S. official as saying </p><p>that the 11 Turks were released on the condition that </p><p>they will remain under the supervision of the Turkish </p><p>military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Responding to press reports that Turkey denied landing </p><p>permission for U.S. planes during the Iraq campaign, </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul said that over 30 damaged American </p><p>planes had been allowed to land at Turkish bases.  The </p><p>TGS, which had been expected to seal a $4 billion deal </p><p>for the purchase of Cobra helicopters by late July, has </p><p>suspended negotiations with the Americans over the </p><p>Suleymaniye incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenian genocide: Foreign Minister Gul said that the </p><p>U.S. Administration is working to block the Armenian </p><p>genocide draft being considered by the U.S. Congress. </p><p>President Bush opposes the bill, and Vice President </p><p>Cheney and Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz are </p><p>lobbying to convince Congressmen to vote against the </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Israeli President visits Turkey: Visiting Israeli </p><p>President Katsav said that the tension between U.S. and </p><p>Turkey would not negatively affect ties between Israel </p><p>and Turkey.  Katsav also said that Israel had activated </p><p>the Jewish lobby in the U.S. to help repair the strain </p><p>between Ankara and Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkish Relations/N. Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A new roadmap for US-Turkish relations" </p><p>Islamist-intellectual Zaman carried an analysis by two </p><p>academics, Orhan Gokce and Birol Akgun (7/10): "There </p><p>is a significant difference in US policies in the post- </p><p>9/11 period and the post Word War II period.  Yet it </p><p>seems the Turkish foreign policy-makers have not fully </p><p>realized it. . We have to realize the fact that Turkey </p><p>and the US are not strategic allies, and that our </p><p>regional interests might conflict with US interests </p><p>from time to time.  Turkey must be able to revise its </p><p>relationship with Washington through a new vision.  It </p><p>seems best for Turkey to design its `roadmap\' by taking </p><p>the new political facts into account and by arranging </p><p>bilateral ties in the spirit of a more `distant\' </p><p>partnership." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shaking the trust within NATO" </p><p>Zafer Atay argued in the economic-political Dunya </p><p>(7/10): "The incident in Suleymaniye is not only an </p><p>appalling game, but also shakes the basic pillars of </p><p>NATO.  The NATO alliance is based on mutual trust, </p><p>solidarity, and willingness to work hand-in-hand for </p><p>the achievement of shared ideals.  The arrest of </p><p>Turkish soldiers and the treatment they were given have </p><p>undermined the pillars of NATO. . There is no point in </p><p>believing that there were `disturbing acts by the </p><p>Turkish team.\'  The event was a clear show of force on </p><p>the US side.  The normalization of Turkish-American </p><p>relations requires two conditions to be met: The US </p><p>should convey an official apology to both Turkey and </p><p>NATO; and those responsible for the Suleymaniye </p><p>incident should be punished." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq issue should not be left to the military alone" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the mass appeal-sensational </p><p>Posta (7/10): "The Iraq issue is too sensitive a </p><p>problem to be left to the military alone.  The military </p><p>should always be under civilian checks and controls. </p><p>They must act within the framework of the policies to </p><p>be formulated by the civilian authority.  The </p><p>military\'s view should always be provided, but the </p><p>civilian authority should make the final decision. If, </p><p>in Iraq, State Department and the other institutions </p><p>had joined the loop rather than the Pentagon alone </p><p>dealing with such issues, today\'s problems would not </p><p>have occurred." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
