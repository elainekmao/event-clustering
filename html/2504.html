<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/PA/PD (HILTON), EUR/RHA </p><p>(BINDENAGEL), EUR/AGS, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, GM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ARCHIVES - POPE ORDERS PARTIAL OPENING FOR </p><p>NAZI GERMANY AND WORLD WAR II DOCUMENTS </p><p> </p><p>1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ORDERED THE PARTIAL OPENING OF </p><p>THE VATICAN ARCHIVES FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO THE PERIOD </p><p>LEADING TO AND DURING WORLD WAR II. IN A FEBRUARY 15 </p><p>STATEMENT THE VATICAN\'S CHIEF ARCHIVIST SAID THAT FROM THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF 2003 MATERIAL FROM PIUS XI\'S PONTIFICATE HELD </p><p>BY THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY PERTAINING TO BAVARIA (1922- </p><p>1939) AND GERMANY (1922-1939), AND IN THE VATICAN SECRET </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00819  190632Z </p><p>ARCHIVE FROM THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIATURE IN MUNICH (1922-1934) </p><p>AND BERLIN (1922-1930) WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>RESEARCHERS. THE COMPLETE RELEASE OF ALL DOCUMENTATION </p><p>RELATING TO PIUS XI\'S PONTIFICATE IS STILL SOME THREE YEARS </p><p>AWAY WHEN ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN STATEMENT, MATERIAL ON </p><p>VATICAN-GERMANY ISSUES DURING THE PONTIFICATE OF PIUS XII </p><p>(1939-1958) WILL ALSO BE RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>2.   ARCHIVAL MATERIAL RELATING TO PRISONERS DURING WORLD </p><p>WAR II WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FROM 2003. THE VATICAN </p><p>STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT THE RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENTATION </p><p>WOULD "REVEAL TO HISTORIANS THE GREAT WORKS OF CHARITY AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE CARRIED OUT BY PIUS XII ON BEHALF OF THE NUMEROUS </p><p>PRISONERS AND OTHER WAR VICTIMS, FROM WHATEVER NATION, </p><p>RELIGION AND RACE." </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE VATICAN STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTED THAT THIS </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY DEPARTURE FROM NORMAL VATICAN ARCHIVE </p><p>PROCEDURES WAS EXPRESSLY ORDERED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II, IN </p><p>THE HOPE THAT THE GESTURE WOULD "CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF </p><p>UNJUST AND UNWELCOME SPECULATION." </p><p> </p><p>4.   COMMENT: THE DECISION TO PARTIALLY OPEN THE VATICAN </p><p>ARCHIVES RELATING TO VATICAN-GERMAN RELATIONS DURING THE </p><p>LEAD UP TO WORLD WAR II AND DURING THE WAR ITSELF APPEARS TO </p><p>BE AN ATTEMPT BY THE POPE TO SILENCE ACCUSATIONS OF ANTI- </p><p>SEMITISM LEVELED AGAINST HIS PREDECESSOR PIUS XII. IT MAY </p><p>ALSO HERALD RENEWED VATICAN INTEREST IN BEATIFYING PIUS XII </p><p>- FREE FROM THE PALL OF SCANDAL AND DERISION. THE DECISION </p><p>BY POPE JOHN PAUL II TO DISPENSE WITH STANDARD OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES IN THIS CASE COMES AFTER YEARS OF VATICAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00819  190632Z </p><p>PROTESTATIONS THAT THIS MATERIAL COULD NOT BE RELEASED </p><p>BECAUSE IT WAS NOT YET PROPERLY CATALOGUED.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE GENERAL ARGUMENT WAS FORWARDED THAT MUCH ARCHIVAL </p><p>MATERIAL WAS "SENSITIVE" AND MIGHT EMBARRASS LIVING PERSONS, </p><p>AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL AFTER A PROPER PERIOD </p><p>OF TIME - CURRENTLY 70 YEARS.  TODAY\'S DECISION SHOWS THAT </p><p>WHEN THE POPE IS CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT CHURCH INTERESTS, HE </p><p>WILL DO AWAY WITH THE VATICAN\'S STANDARD OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO FURTHER THOSE INTERESTS. THE DECISION </p><p>SHOWS THAT WHATEVER THE POPE WANTS, DOES IN FACT HAPPEN. </p><p>END COMMENT. NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00819 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
