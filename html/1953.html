<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002227 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/10/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA PROTESTS VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES </p><p>ROBERT C. PORTER, JR.  REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  ( C ) SUMMARY: AN MFA DEMARCHE TO CHARGE </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 10 CHARACTERIZED THE HOUSE </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT </p><p>(VHRA) AS THE MOST SERIOUS STEP SINCE </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AND WARNED OF </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING ON </p><p>RATFICATION HERE OF THE BTA.  THE OFFICIAL </p><p>REACTION IS PREDICTABLE BUT NONETHELESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02227  01 OF 02  101032Z </p><p>REFLECTS ONGOING TOP LEVEL SUSPICION OF US </p><p>MOTIVES TOWARD VIETNAM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ( C ) FOREIGN MINISTRY (MFA) AMERICAS </p><p>DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR NGUYEN XUAN PHONG CALLED </p><p>CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES TO MFA ON SEPTEMBER 10, </p><p>HAVING BEEN UNWILLING TO MEET WITH ANY OTHER </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICIAL ON SEPTEMBER 7 IN CHARGE\'S </p><p>ABSENCE IN HO CHI MINH CITY.   PHONG TOLD </p><p>CHARGE THAT HE WISHED TO EXPRESS THE </p><p>"FEELING" THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE VIETNAM </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACT (VHRA) COULD HAVE A </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS AND ON THE WILLINGNESS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF VIETNAM TO </p><p>WORK WITH THE USG.  HE NOTED THAT THE "HARD </p><p>REALITY" OF THE 410-1 VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES MADE IT "IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY" </p><p>THAT THIS REFLECTED MINORITY OPINION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ( C ) PHONG LABELED THE CONTENT OF THE </p><p>VHRA AS A "BLATENT LIE" AND AS "GROSS </p><p>INTERFERENCE" IN VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD REPEATEDLY DURING </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT URGED THE REVOCATION OF THE </p><p>JACKSON-VANICH AMENDMENT AS A "COLD WAR </p><p>RELIC."  HOWEVER, NOT ONLY DID THE JACKSON- </p><p>VANICH AMENDMENT STILL APPLY TO VIETNAM, BUT </p><p>CONGRESS WAS NOW SEEKING TO MAKE AN "EVEN </p><p>WORSE" LAW (THE VHRA), WHICH WAS AIMED AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02227  01 OF 02  101032Z </p><p>OPPOSING THE INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM, AS WELL AS BEING AGAINST THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF THE FUTURE OF BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ( C ) PHONG STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND PEOPLE OF VIETNAM VIEWED THE VHRA AS THE </p><p>"MOST BLATANT AND SERIOUS" ACT REGARDING </p><p>POLICY TOWARD VIETNAM SINCE THE </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  HE CALLED THE </p><p>IMPACT OF ITS POSSIBLE PASSAGE BY THE SENATE </p><p>AS "UNPREDICTABLE," ESPECIALLY AS CONCERNED </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RATIFICATION OF THE BTA. </p><p>PHONG SAID THAT THE MFA "SQUARELY OPPOSED" </p><p>THE VHRA AND REQUESTED THE STATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>TO "DO WHATEVER" TO STOP SENATE APPROVAL, IN </p><p>THE INTEREST OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ( C ) PHONG ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT </p><p>THE STATE DEPARTMENT, CONTRARY TO </p><p>EXPECTATIONS, HAD NOT FORMALLY OPPOSED HOUSE </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE VHRA, AND CALLED ON </p><p>ADDITIONAL STEPS BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>BEFORE SENATE CONSIDERATION.  SENATE PASSAGE </p><p>COULD HAVE A "VERY, VERY NEGATIVE" IMPACT </p><p>HERE AND WOULD BE "VERY DANGEROUS" TO THE </p><p>FUTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>IT WAS ALREADY "VERY DIFFICULT" TO EXPLAIN </p><p>HOUSE PASSAGE OF THE VHRA TO THE PEOPLE AND </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF VIETNAM, SOME OF WHOM WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02227  01 OF 02  101032Z </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT A PERCEIVED HARDENING OF US </p><p>POLICY TOWARD VIETNAM OR EVEN ABOUT A </p><p>"SECOND AGENDA" OF SEEKING TO DESTROY </p><p>VIETNAM\'S "REVOLUTION, COUNTRY, AND PEOPLE, </p><p>IN SPITE OF BEAUTIFUL WORDS."  HE NOTED THE </p><p>VHRA\'S INCLUSION OF FUNDS FOR GROUPS TO </p><p>PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, WHICH SOME IN </p><p>VIETNAM SAW AS A PRETEXT TO URGE VIETNAMESE </p><p>PEOPLE TO "RAISE UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ( C ) WHILE EMPHASIZING THE POSITIVE </p><p>VOTE ON BTA THE SAME DAY BY THE HOUSE, </p><p>CHARGE PROMISED TO CONVEY MFA CONCERNS TO </p><p>WASHINGTON.  HE NOTED THAT HOUSE PASSAGE OF </p><p>THE VHRA REFLECTED CONCERN OVER THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS SITUATION IN VIETNAM AND URGED </p><p>VIETNAM TO CONSIDER STEPS TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND ITS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>IMAGE, SUCH AS ACCESS BY INDEPENDENT </p><p>OBSERVERS TO THICH QUANG DO, AS WELL AS TO </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  HE AGREED WITH PHONG </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES NEEDED TO WORK HARD </p><p>TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP MOVING </p><p>IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION, AND AGAIN URGED THE </p><p>GVN TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO OVERALL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ( C ) COMMENT:  MUCH OF THE MFA DEMARCHE </p><p>WAS PREDICTABLE, AND PHONG READ CAREFULLY </p><p>FROM A SCRIPT THAT ECHOED SIMILAR COMMENTS </p><p>BY THE MFA SPOKESMAN AND IN A SEPTEMBER 8 </p><p>"NHAN DAN" COMMENTARY.  THE SHRILL TONE IS </p><p>PROBABLY ALSO RELATED TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02227  02 OF 02  101033Z </p><p>ONGOING HEIGHTENED WORRY AMONG SOME OF THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP ABOUT THE USG\'S COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>FUTURE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  THE </p><p>MFA MUST HAVE FELT TAKEN OFF GUARD AND </p><p>INADEQUATELY ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP THE ABSENCE OF FORMAL STATE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO VHRA BEFORE THE HOUSE VHRA </p><p>VOTE AND THE ONE-SIDED NATURE OF THE VOTE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
