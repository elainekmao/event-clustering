(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) A western oil executive previously commented to </p><p>Econchief that the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is </p><p>producing about 10 percent or 200,000 barrels per day (b/d) </p><p>over its current OPEC quota of 2.138 million barrels per </p><p>day (mmb/d) (ref A).  The western oil exec clarified on March </p><p>19 that the above-mentioned overproduction also includes an </p><p>approximate 120,000-150,000 b/d of oil from Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Comment: This tracks well with ADNOC officials\' </p><p>disclosure this week that Abu Dhabi is producing 2.2 mmb/d </p><p>(ref B), which combined with Dubai\'s production indicates that </p><p>the UAE is over-producing its quota by about 200,000 barrels </p><p>per day. OPEC\'s production quota for the UAE encompasses output </p><p>from both Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  However, as Dubai was not a </p><p>member of OPEC at the time of the UAE\'s federation (1971) -- </p><p>and because Abu Dhabi production is so much larger than Dubai\'s </p><p>-- it has long been the policy here that Dubai will produce as </p><p>much oil as it can, with Abu Dhabi filling the rest of the UAE\'s </p><p>quota. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
