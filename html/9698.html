<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 KUWAIT 003358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, IR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT AND THE UNITED STATES: AN AGENDA FOR FUTURE </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM John G. Moran, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Introduction / Overview </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Kuwait and the United States have been full partners </p><p>in the defense of Kuwait since the 1990-91 Gulf War. </p><p>Beginning with the liberation of Kuwait, the fruits of this </p><p>partnership have included the decade long successful </p><p>containment of Saddam Hussein\'s quest for weapons of mass </p><p>destruction and regional domination, the modernization and </p><p>restructuring of Kuwait\'s armed forces and most recently the </p><p>liberation of Iraq from Saddam\'s tyranny.  Long-standing </p><p>cooperation in several other areas has also served our mutual </p><p>interests.  For example, US firms played an active role in </p><p>extinguishing Kuwait\'s oil fires after the war and rebuilding </p><p>key components of the country\'s infrastructure.  Kuwait has </p><p>chosen American partners for major investments in its nascent </p><p>petrochemical industry and American firms are now favorably </p><p>positioned to compete for the Project Kuwait contract to </p><p>develop and operate Kuwait\'s northern oil fields.  American </p><p>and Kuwaiti experts have also worked closely on nuclear </p><p>non-proliferation and other important security issues.  For </p><p>example, Kuwait has been a willing partner in the global war </p><p>on terrorism, offering extensive use of its facilities during </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom and taking steps to prevent the </p><p>diversion of funds from legitimate purposes to the financing </p><p>of terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Notwithstanding the productive cooperation we have </p><p>enjoyed in so many areas, there have been some notable </p><p>exceptions.  For example, Kuwait has so far failed to live up </p><p>to commitments by its Amir to extend suffrage to women and to </p><p>award a major commercial power project to an American firm. </p><p>There has been little, if any, progress on political, </p><p>economic or educational reform.  A two-year old investment </p><p>law remains unimplemented due to the GOK\'s failure to draft </p><p>implementing regulations.  Kuwait remains a poor performer, </p><p>even by regional standards, on the protection of intellectual </p><p>property rights and the rights of foreign workers.  Kuwait </p><p>has also not been sufficiently forthright in its support of </p><p>efforts to find a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>dispute, an issue of professed importance to it.  It has not </p><p>yet ratified all of the major international conventions </p><p>against terrorism, most notably the convention on the </p><p>suppression of terrorist finance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) With the defeat of Saddam Hussein\'s regime, our </p><p>overall relations with Kuwait are probably as good now as </p><p>they\'ve ever been since the immediate aftermath of </p><p>liberation.  However, potential future problems are already </p><p>surfacing.  The occasion of the inauguration of a new </p><p>National Assembly and a new Council of Ministers in Kuwait, </p><p>including a "new" Prime Minister, provides an excellent </p><p>opportunity to review the current state of relations and to </p><p>consider our most pressing priorities for the future as well </p><p>as how best to accomplish them.  Paragraphs 10 - 15 contain </p><p>our key recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>The State of Relations </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Political Issues: Notwithstanding our stunning </p><p>victory over Saddam\'s forces on the battlefield, the </p><p>bilateral relationship is currently burdened by a widely held </p><p>perception among Kuwaitis that the USG has not properly </p><p>acknowledged Kuwait\'s indispensable role in the liberation of </p><p>Iraq.  This sentiment was fueled by the last-minute </p><p>cancellation of President Bush\'s planned visit, and the fact </p><p>that primary Iraq  reconstruction contracts have been given </p><p>only to US contractors.  The GOK is already fretting about </p><p>our ability to stay the course in Iraq while some private </p><p>Kuwaitis gripe at perceived slights such as lack of adequate </p><p>(in their eyes) support for TF Hope, the Kuwaiti task force </p><p>hunting for Kuwaitis missing in Iraq from the Gulf War.  UN </p><p>Compensation Commission issues also bear close scrutiny as </p><p>potentially huge negatives.  There is little understanding </p><p>here of the positive role the US played in the negotiation of </p><p>UNSC 1483 to preserve </p><p>contributions to the UN Compensation Fund.  Over time, </p><p>continued US requests for GOK resource contributions for </p><p>various projects could also gradually help erode the overall </p><p>relationship. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Somewhat paradoxically, the removal of the Iraqi </p><p>threat may negatively alter our ability to advance important </p><p>US objectives such as women\'s suffrage and the extension of </p><p>labor law to domestic servants in the coming year.  Prior to </p><p>the conflict in Iraq, GOK action on such progressive issues - </p><p>issues sometimes vehemently opposed by Islamist and other </p><p>sectors of Kuwait\'s generally conservative society - was </p><p>often undertaken simply out of fear that inaction would </p><p>damage the U.S./Kuwaiti relationship.   In other words, </p><p>regardless of the merits of the arguments or positions </p><p>advocated by the USG, they </p><p>were often sold - if tacitly - to the Kuwaiti public as </p><p>necessary for maintaining the special strategic/security </p><p>relationship with its ultimate security guarantor, the United </p><p>States.  With the backdrop of this security threat removed, </p><p>the GOK will likely meet with less success on divisive issues </p><p>such as women\'s suffrage or the extension of labor rights </p><p>(even if it chooses to push them) until a stronger domestic </p><p>constituency for these issues arises.  In addition, the </p><p>election of a National Assembly where so-called Independents </p><p>have the potential to provide swing votes on many issues may </p><p>prove a further obstacle to the successful passage of </p><p>progressive reform, particularly if a cohesive Islamist </p><p>opposition emerges.  As evidenced by the furor over the </p><p>former Minister of Education\'s comments vis-a-vis education </p><p>reform, Islamist demagogues are more than ready to try to tar </p><p>any initiative that can be deemed un-Islamic and/or is </p><p>associated with the West as being raised solely due to U.S. </p><p>"interference" in domestic political matters.  It is </p><p>difficult to exaggerate the level of sensitivity to any </p><p>perceived imposition of Western culture.  US initiatives in </p><p>key areas of women\'s suffrage, reform of education and </p><p>extension of labor law to domestics will inevitably put us at </p><p>cross purposes with some GOK constituencies. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NOFORN) Military Cooperation Issues: Although </p><p>military-military cooperation remains generally excellent, </p><p>there are already some signs of deterioration in this area as </p><p>well.  The GOK recently informed us that it has decided to </p><p>cancel its participation in Exercise Lucky Sentinel, the only </p><p>bilateral joint and combined exercise on the books. </p><p>(This decision seems to be budget driven and possibly subject </p><p>to change.)  They are also pushing back on Burden Sharing </p><p>support under the bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement for </p><p>our planned long-term deployment of an augmented Brigade </p><p>Combat Team (15,000 US troops) and dragging their feet on </p><p>Camp Arifjan upgrades (which could delay our planned early </p><p>2005 departure from Camp Doha) and on previous commitments to </p><p>upgrades at Al Jaber and Al Salem Airbases.  Meanwhile, </p><p>delays in the search for POW\'s, continued high throughput of </p><p>USG officials and Iraqis without proper documentation (visas) </p><p>on short notice are a potential political irritant that might </p><p>eventually impact on mil-mil relations.  On the other hand, a </p><p>bright spot is that the Minister of Defense and the Chief of </p><p>Staff are known quantities with whom we\'ve worked well. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NOFORN)  Counter-Terrorism/Security Issues: The USG has </p><p>enjoyed excellent cooperation from the various Kuwaiti </p><p>government organs involved in counter terrorism and security </p><p>issues since the terrorist attacks of September 11, </p><p>culminating in a number of new cooperative initiatives during </p><p>the war in Iraq.  Many of these initiatives, aimed at </p><p>countering potential Iraqi threats, were worked at a vigorous </p><p>pace before and during the war, leading to extreme fatigue on </p><p>the part of Kuwaiti services.  The Kuwaiti State Security </p><p>(KSS) Service, overworked during the war, will no doubt slow </p><p>its pace somewhat as it focuses on its move to a new </p><p>headquarters this fall.  Most KSS officers of senior rank are </p><p>planning long vacations beginning in late July or August </p><p>2003, returning to work just prior to the move in October. </p><p>The KSS still has an interim director and many officers are </p><p>suffering from chronically poor morale as a result of public </p><p>criticism (fueled by allegations of abuse from extremists </p><p>arrested or questioned by KSS) and their perceived lack of </p><p>adequate compensation.  All of the above issues will likely </p><p>contribute to an anticipated slowing in joint </p><p>counter-terrorism efforts in the near term.  Moreover, </p><p>leadership on this front, which should come from the Minister </p><p>of Interior, remains a question mark, as we have relatively </p><p>little experience with the newly named minister. </p><p>Nonetheless, physical security provided by the Ministry of </p><p>Interior should remain fully adequate and we expect no </p><p>diminution in this regard.  Kuwaiti support is also expected </p><p>to remain strong on military security issues.  The </p><p>well-respected director of the Kuwaiti military intelligence </p><p>(KMI) service, Brigadier General Khalid al-Jarrah al-Sabah, </p><p>has been informally named the new J-2 for the Ministry of </p><p>Defense, insuring a proactive senior interlocutor in military </p><p>security issues for the foreseeable future.  On the political </p><p>level, the continued detention of 12 Kuwait at GTMO could </p><p>become an irritant as  the detainees\' families and their </p><p>sympathizers periodically stir the pot. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Commercial Issues: Commercial relations are a </p><p>relatively bright spot in bilateral relations.  We\'ve won </p><p>several contracts for American companies recently and US </p><p>firms are well positioned to be big players in the </p><p>development of Kuwait\'s northern oil fields.  However, the </p><p>terms offered thus far are not at all attractive.  The status </p><p>of the Amir\'s commitment on the Al Zour North power project </p><p>also remains elusive.  (The Ambassador recently transmitted </p><p>Secretary of Commerce Evan\'s letter to the Prime Minister </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>asking for reaffirmation of this commitment - by "employing </p><p>US firms to supply equipment and services necessary for the </p><p>development of this power project.")  Such advocacy demands </p><p>will continue, potentially alienating domestic constituencies </p><p>already disappointed by the alleged lack of success thus far </p><p>of Kuwaiti companies in securing contracts on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction programs.  An upside, however, could be </p><p>growing cooperation between US and Kuwaiti firms to exploit </p><p>commercial opportunities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Economic Reform Issues: Cooperation on economic </p><p>policy issues remains perhaps the most disappointing area of </p><p>our bilateral relationship.  Without significant further </p><p>progress on the protection of intellectual property rights </p><p>this year, Kuwait should be put on the Special 301 Priority </p><p>Watch List.  GOK tax policy and offset requirements as well </p><p>as the GOK\'s failure to conform to its WTO obligations are </p><p>also potentially serious negatives.  In developing our </p><p>program to address these and other economic issues with </p><p>Kuwait, we will emphasize the win-win aspects of market-based </p><p>reform.  Rather than emphasize the IPR revenue that U.S. </p><p>exporters lose to counterfeiters of software and </p><p>entertainment products, for example, we will quantify the </p><p>costs to Kuwait\'s importers, distributors and its nascent IPR </p><p>industry.  Rather than dwell on past stumbles in our </p><p>bilateral efforts toward economic and regulatory reform, we </p><p>will attempt to tie progressive GOK actions to beneficial </p><p>regional or multilateral steps at the WTO and elsewhere.  The </p><p>same strategy will be applied to the issue of the inequity in </p><p>Kuwait\'s treatment of foreign workers, by </p><p>highlighting the increased productivity that enlightened </p><p>labor law produces over time. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Achieving the Bilateral Agenda </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) It is an axiom of international diplomacy that a </p><p>downturn in bilateral relations follows any great effort in a </p><p>common cause.  In the case of Kuwait, the GOK leadership and </p><p>the majority of the country\'s elites have stood steadfastly </p><p>with the US against Iraq at some cost to their relations with </p><p>their Muslim/Arab neighbors.  While they had very good </p><p>reasons for doing so--Kuwaitis needed no reminder of the </p><p>existential threat they faced from Saddam--it must be said </p><p>that their support for us during OIF exceeded our </p><p>expectations.  Now that that threat has been removed we must </p><p>show our friends here that the US continues to value its </p><p>friendship and commitment to Kuwait, and that we do not view </p><p>the country merely as a cash cow for international </p><p>commitments or as a parking lot for regional military forces. </p><p> While Kuwait continues to be a moderate and relatively (by </p><p>Arab world standards) progressive society, even Desert Storm </p><p>and OIF did not completely inoculate it against the wider </p><p>political currents sweeping the Muslim world.  Lacking </p><p>personal experience with liberation, younger Kuwaitis are </p><p>particularly vulnerable to these contagions.  Our strategies </p><p>to effect the changes enumerated above should be conducted in </p><p>a manner that supports reform without allowing our opponents </p><p>to convince the average Kuwaiti </p><p>that we are wantonly interfering in domestic affairs.  We </p><p>must therefore be prepared to articulate clearly the reasons </p><p>behind our requests, why we feel we have a stake in the </p><p>issues and how our proposals will benefit Kuwait as well as </p><p>the US.  These are sometimes difficult tasks to accomplish; </p><p>we will then need Washington\'s active support to succeed. </p><p>Our key recommendations are given below. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Political Issues: </p><p> </p><p>-- Increased visits by high-level USG officials (including </p><p>the Secretary, and hopefully, the President) this fall would </p><p>do much to reverse the ongoing erosion in relations due to </p><p>local concerns that Kuwait\'s contributions to OIF have not </p><p>been sufficiently recognized by the USG.  Such visits would </p><p>also help to bolster Shaykh Sabah at an early stage of his </p><p>tenure as Prime Minister and could energize him to act on </p><p>issues of importance to us sooner than otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>-- If visits to Kuwait are not feasible for the </p><p>Secretary/President, an invitation for Shaykh Sabah to visit </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Washington in the fall would be well received, although it </p><p>would not have the same domestic resonance in Kuwait as a </p><p>visit here. </p><p> </p><p>-- With regard to specific issues, our highest priorities are </p><p>women\'s suffrage, educational reform and trafficking in </p><p>persons, primarily a labor reform issue here.  All lie in the </p><p>sensitive socio/religious field.  They will be our toughest </p><p>nuts to crack.  Given the political environment, our work on </p><p>such issues must be persistent but low-key. </p><p>-- Substantive embassy sections are coordinating closely with </p><p>one another to target post\'s MEPI proposals effectively and </p><p>accurately to build domestic constituencies in favor of </p><p>reform.  Specific suggestions include an increase in </p><p>exchanges between influential Kuwaitis and U.S. NGO\'s </p><p>focusing on advancing the role of women in political life. </p><p> </p><p>-- Facilitation of contacts between the National Assembly and </p><p>the US Congress could also be beneficial.  We need to work </p><p>harder to arrange visits to Washington by key </p><p>parliamentarians and to exploit the temporary surge in </p><p>CODEL\'s passing through Kuwait to set up meetings with </p><p>important counterparts in the National Assembly as well as </p><p>with GOK officials. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S/NOFORN) Military Cooperation: </p><p> </p><p>-- While we should not rule out active participation in </p><p>coalition activities outside Kuwait\'s borders, the true </p><p>military value of this partnership lies in Kuwait\'s strategic </p><p>location and readiness to provide a base of operations. </p><p>Although Kuwait is currently resisting increasing levels of </p><p>requested burden sharing support, this probably reflects </p><p>fiscal realities and a perception of the elimination of their </p><p>principal threat more than anything else. We should have </p><p>little real difficulty maintaining a significant US military </p><p>presence (primarily land forces) while focusing our </p><p>engagement with the Kuwaitis on bilateral exercises, training </p><p>and military sales targeted to give needed capabilities. </p><p> </p><p>-- A robust slate of engagement activities is critical to </p><p>honing KAF capabilities, maintaining personal relationships </p><p>with key military and GOK leaders, and providing a stable </p><p>foundation for continued activities in Iraq, as well as for </p><p>any potential future requirements in the GWOT.  Planned </p><p>enhancements to Camp Arifjan, to which we should move the </p><p>bulk of our forces in early 2005, and upgrades to the two </p><p>airbases will support this and should be pushed. </p><p> </p><p>-- The US must also make every attempt to ensure </p><p>interoperability of Kuwait\'s military with our own and their </p><p>willingness to employ it if needed.  Continuance of a full </p><p>slate of bilateral exercises will help ensure this and must </p><p>be stressed continuously.  Such continued engagement </p><p>activities should stress the global terrorist nature of the </p><p>threat (ala Saudi 12 May 03 attacks) and the capabilities </p><p>Kuwait needs to defend against similar threats. </p><p> </p><p>-- Several bilateral activities this fall and/or early 2004 </p><p>could serve all these goals: a meeting of the bilateral </p><p>Defense Review Group followed by a visit of the Minister of </p><p>Defense to the US, during which a meeting of the Joint </p><p>Military Commission could take place for the first time since </p><p>1999. </p><p> </p><p>13. (S/NOFORN) Counter-Terrorism/Security: </p><p> </p><p>-- As threats related to Iraq continue to diminish we will be </p><p>able to focus even greater attention on foreign and domestic </p><p>Sunni extremists such as al-Qa\'ida members and sympathizers, </p><p>as well as Iranian sponsored threats and local Hizbullah </p><p>elements.  This will mean turning even more attention to </p><p>potential threats from Kuwaiti citizens-a very sensitive </p><p>political issue for KSS, KMI and the Ministry of Interior. </p><p>It will surely take time and considerable patient effort to </p><p>re-energize the Kuwaiti security forces and focus them on </p><p>working jointly on our perceived priority threats. </p><p> </p><p>-- Continued high level visits from ORCA HQ and invitations </p><p>to the Minister of Interior to visit there will be crucial in </p><p>nurturing these efforts.  We May also wish to consider visits </p><p>by senior FBI and Department of Justice Officials, as well as </p><p>by State\'s </p><p>Coordinator for Counter-terrorism and the Assistant Secretary </p><p>for Diplomatic Security, perhaps in conjunction with any </p><p>future visits to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Commercial: </p><p> </p><p>-- We will continue to pursue advocacy requests </p><p>energetically, including through written appeals from senior </p><p>Administration officials on high-value cases, such as Project </p><p>Kuwait and the al-Zour North power plant.  However, we should </p><p>recognize the limitations of such approaches. </p><p> </p><p>-- To adequately exploit the many commercial opportunities </p><p>likely to be available in Kuwait in the coming two years, </p><p>full staffing of the embassy\'s FCS section will be essential. </p><p> We also encourage Washington to reconsider our previous </p><p>proposal for the establishment of a trade and investment </p><p>promotion office in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>-- This will help to get the GOK and Kuwaiti private sector </p><p>more actively engaged on Iraqi reconstruction.  Mobilizing </p><p>private investment and job creation is much more important </p><p>than any concessional assistance we can possibly wring out of </p><p>the GOK. </p><p>15.  (C) Economic Reform: </p><p> </p><p>-- Based on our consultations with industry representatives, </p><p>relevant USG agencies and WTO guidelines, we will engage the </p><p>GOK with specific proposals to achieve reform of all major </p><p>IPR  areas, including amendments to its copyright law and </p><p>improved inter-ministerial cooperation on enforcement.  We </p><p>will promote industry-designed seminars and training programs </p><p>on combating piracy.  We will work with EB\'s IPR office to </p><p>adapt to Kuwait\'s environment an enforcement model that USTR </p><p>has recommended for Poland. </p><p> </p><p>-- On economic and regulatory reform issues, we will lay the </p><p>groundwork by encouraging Kuwait\'s return to long-suspended </p><p>negotiations on a Double-Taxation Treaty.  A Bilateral </p><p>Investment Treaty and a Trade and Investment Framework </p><p>Agreement may also be potentially </p><p>negotiable.  USTR is preparing summaries of USG\'s earlier </p><p>positions on a BIT and Double-Taxation Treaty.  The GOK </p><p>meanwhile is documenting its earlier positions and </p><p>formulating an initial offer. </p><p> </p><p>-- On terrorist finance, in the short term, we will encourage </p><p>the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Kuwait to </p><p>nominate officers for U.S. Department of the Treasury </p><p>Anti-Terrorist Financing and Money-Laundering Courses.  We </p><p>will also work with the GOK to </p><p>prepare a base-line study of GOK actions on freeze requests </p><p>up until this time. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
