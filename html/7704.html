<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 001043 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/AAE; EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, EAID, LA, VM, UNODC, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MONITORING VISIT TO KY SON PHASE II PROJECT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  01 Hanoi 3262 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Much to the relief of district </p><p>officials and following extensive delays, the UNODC-funded </p><p>Ky Son Phase II is up and running.  Agriculture and </p><p>livestock models -- the focus of the USG assistance to this </p><p>project --  are being implemented in a number of communes </p><p>dispersed around the district.  The selection process for </p><p>those benefiting from the project is unclear, however.  The </p><p>inventory control system currently in place is also not an </p><p>effective management tool.  UNODC is aware of these problems </p><p>and is attempting to address them, a process complicated by </p><p>the new national project execution.  Septel will report on </p><p>developments in and around the district\'s Nam Can border </p><p>crossing.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  At the invitation of the United Nations Office of </p><p>Drugs and Crime (UNODC -- formerly UNDCP), poloff and pol </p><p>FSN visited Ky Son district in Nghe An Province April 21 - </p><p>24.  (Embassy very much appreciates INL funding for this </p><p>travel.)  Ky Son, which borders Laos, is one of the poorest </p><p>districts in one of Vietnam\'s poorest provinces.  It is </p><p>about a 10-hour drive from Hanoi.  Ky Son\'s population is </p><p>about 60,000, nearly all ethnic minorities (mainly Hmong and </p><p>Kho Mu).  Until 1993, approximately 1,000 hectares of opium </p><p>poppy were grown in the district.  Cultivation has been </p><p>essentially eliminated in Ky Son except in a few remote </p><p>locations.  However, according to UNODC, there is "anecdotal </p><p>evidence" that local Ky Son farmers are cultivating opium on </p><p>the Lao side of the border for consumption and sale in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The visit included meetings with provincial and </p><p>district authorities as well as observation of about 10 </p><p>separate crop substitution and alternative development </p><p>activities in four different communes located in various </p><p>areas of Ky Son district.  Activities visited included </p><p>raising livestock (pigs) and "black" chickens as well as </p><p>cultivating fruit trees (peach and plums), mushrooms, tea, </p><p>terrace rice, and hybrid Chinese (flatland) rice.  Some </p><p>activities were continuations of those begun under Phase I, </p><p>which finished in February 2001; others are new under Phase </p><p>II.  Officially titled "Capacity Building for Alternative </p><p>Development to replace Opium Poppy Cultivation," the project </p><p>was scheduled to begin January 2002.  Actual project </p><p>implementation began in July 2002 (see paras 7 and 8 for </p><p>reasons for this delay). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>DISTRICT SUPPORT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  At Mung Xem, the Ky Son district capital, People\'s </p><p>Committee Chairman Mua No Tu stated that the people in his </p><p>district had "benefited greatly" from the project and "are </p><p>happy" that, after a long delay, Phase II was up and </p><p>running.  He expected Phase II would be "as successful as </p><p>Phase I."  Implementing Phase II meant that UNODC and the </p><p>donor community were "still committed" to making the area </p><p>free from opium poppy cultivation, he noted.  However, he </p><p>lamented that a "small amount" of poppy recultivation had </p><p>occurred this past year in a remote area in the southwestern </p><p>part of the district, but claimed that authorities had </p><p>"quickly eradicated it."  Other communes were "very much </p><p>looking forward" to new project activities, he added.  Tu </p><p>said that at a project review meeting among all relevant </p><p>parties scheduled for "sometime" in May in Hanoi, the </p><p>district and authorities from the Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>and Rural Development (MARD) plan to ask for a project </p><p>extension (with no additional funds) because to the "late </p><p>start" for implementation. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to Nguyen Xuan Phuong, the Phase II </p><p>onsite project manager, Phase II will implement project </p><p>models in 16 of Ky Son\'s 20 communes.  According to UNODC\'s </p><p>technical advisor, Per Vogel, this is "very ambitious," </p><p>considering the logistics involved and the weak </p><p>infrastructure in most parts of the district.  However, if </p><p>the project is indeed extended, it would be possible to </p><p>reach more communes, he predicted. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>LESS UNODC CONTROL - SUBSEQUENT DELAYS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>6.   (U)  According to Vogel, a key feature of Phase II is </p><p>that the GVN assumed management control for most of the </p><p>project\'s components.  The major exception is in the area of </p><p>personnel and administration, which is essentially Vogel\'s </p><p>responsibility.  Vogel, a former UNODC program officer, was </p><p>also involved with Phase I.  Under Phase II, he is a </p><p>contract employee based in Hanoi.  He said that he travels </p><p>to Ky Son "about two or three times" per quarter. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The GVN\'s request to change the project\'s </p><p>modality to national project execution ("NEX") came as a </p><p>"surprise" to UNODC and made the original project document </p><p>"somewhat obsolete," according to Vogel.  As a result of </p><p>this request, it was impossible to transition quickly from </p><p>Phase I and "some momentum" was lost, he admitted.  In </p><p>addition, MARD\'s national project director insisted on </p><p>hiring an onsite project manager whom he knew personally. </p><p>The appointment was a "disaster," Vogel claimed.  Firing and </p><p>replacing the national project manager also cost "a few </p><p>months," he admitted.  Vogel said that he was unsure why the </p><p>request to change to NEX came up so suddenly, but he opined </p><p>that national authorities "might have looked" at UNDP, where </p><p>he claimed most projects are NEX.  (Note:  An NGO source who </p><p>has worked in the Ky Son area told poloff on April 25 that </p><p>UNDP is "reevaluating NEX" in light of implementation and </p><p>accountability problems on "several projects."  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Another issue delaying implementation involved </p><p>the hiring of "specialists" tasked with acting as advisors </p><p>to villages for the various components of the project.  The </p><p>pool of applicants was greatly reduced, according to Vogel, </p><p>because UNODC required the candidates to have a high level </p><p>of English.  Several of the specialists hired in May 2002 </p><p>have underperformed, according to Vogel; when their </p><p>contracts expire in May, they will not be renewed.  Vogel </p><p>concluded that that the English language requirement was </p><p>"unrealistic."  Previously, UNODC required specialists to </p><p>write their reports in English; that will no longer be the </p><p>case -- specialists under the new contract will write their </p><p>reports in Vietnamese and the reports will then be </p><p>translated into English by the project\'s Hanoi office. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SELECTION PROCESS PROBLEMS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Most of the households poloffs visited appeared to </p><p>have some sort of official connection that resulted in their </p><p>participation in the project.  Many were vague about exactly </p><p>how they were selected (e.g., "officials contacted me").  A </p><p>few said that they had previously received benefits from </p><p>Phase I; those appeared relatively prosperous. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  At Huoi Tu commune, about 10 miles northeast of </p><p>Mung Xem, poloffs visited a tea nursery model supported by </p><p>the project.  The objective of the model is to introduce a </p><p>higher-quality tea in the region.  He could not say how many </p><p>or which family households would eventually benefit from the </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  In Tac Ca commune, about five miles west of Mung </p><p>Xem, poloffs visited a newly installed pigsty.  The </p><p>household had received cement from the project to build the </p><p>sty, as well as several sows.  The person in charge of the </p><p>pigs admitted that he did "knew very little" about pigs but </p><p>that his son, the village chief, had asked him to look after </p><p>them.  In Hui Kiem commune, about six miles southeast of </p><p>Mung Xem, the project is assisting a woman to grow </p><p>mushrooms.  She said that while she had been helped with a </p><p>similar project in Phase I, that crop had "failed." </p><p>Subsequently, she reapplied and "the authorities decided to </p><p>help me again."  Subsequently, the woman admitted that she </p><p>was the chairperson of the commune farmers\' association. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  In Muong Long commune, about 20 miles northeast of </p><p>Mung Xen, poloffs visited a relatively prosperous three </p><p>hectare farm that consisted of plum and peach trees, a few </p><p>other crops such as corn, and a well-tended chicken coop. </p><p>The farmer said that he had received tree graftings from </p><p>neighbors who had originally received peach trees (imported </p><p>from Australia and France) during Phase I.  He said that he </p><p>was "looking forward" to receiving more trees in Phase II. </p><p>Project manager Phuong explained that this household had </p><p>"shown much initiative" during Phase I and proved that that </p><p>project could be successful with an individual who had once </p><p>grown poppy on his land.  Therefore, "authorities" decided </p><p>he should receive additional assistance under Phase II. </p><p>Phuong also claimed that the project wanted to implement </p><p>project models among households that had a "good chance to </p><p>succeed." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  In Huu Kiem commune, about 7 miles southeast of </p><p>Mung Xem, poloffs visited a relatively large complex </p><p>containing several fishponds, a pigsty, a chicken coop, and </p><p>crops, including corn and vegetables.  While these </p><p>activities were not project-supported, the farmer said that </p><p>he was "expecting" the project to provide new fish for the </p><p>fish ponds.  The farmer said that he had recently moved to </p><p>the complex and had agreed to make rent payments totaling </p><p>VND 14 million (about USD 980) for the next year to the </p><p>district Agriculture and Forestry department to use the </p><p>property.  He had also recently purchased 65 sows for about </p><p>VND 500,000 each (about USD 35).  The farmer said he was </p><p>expecting to receive fish from the project to stock the </p><p>ponds.  When asked how he managed to pay the rent and buy </p><p>the livestock, he replied "through my savings."  (Comment: </p><p>In a poor area such as this one, having sufficient savings </p><p>to pay rent and buy livestock from savings would seem highly </p><p>unlikely.  End Comment.)  Subsequent questioning revealed </p><p>that the "tenant" was the head of the local farmer\'s union. </p><p>Vogel said that based on what he had seen at this site, he </p><p>would inform the project management that funds should go to </p><p>someone more in need because this individual already </p><p>appeared well-established and the farmer appeared to be </p><p>benefiting from official connections.  He speculated that </p><p>the capital might have come (at least indirectly) from other </p><p>donors active in the district. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Subsequent to the field visits, Vogel admitted </p><p>that the selection process "was not working the way I would </p><p>like."  He lamented that his ability to influence the </p><p>process was "limited" due to NEX and the need for him to </p><p>spend the majority of his time in Hanoi.  Despite a district- </p><p>wide "needs assessment" carried out during the early stages </p><p>of Phase II implementation as well as provisions for </p><p>participatory selection, he agreed that the selection </p><p>process "left much to be desired in terms of transparency." </p><p>Vogel lamented that based on his observations during the </p><p>field visit, it appeared that the authorities "were not </p><p>paying much attention" to the criteria for participation. </p><p>He said he would meet with officials to try to push for a </p><p>more balanced approach; however, he cautioned that NEX </p><p>limits his influence in the process. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>INVENTORY CONTROLS - NOT A CLEAR PICTURE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  According to project manager Phuong,  normally </p><p>there is not much expendable equipment around the UNODC </p><p>project house.  As project material comes in, it is </p><p>generally moved out to the project areas quickly.  The </p><p>current inventory system is not a "living document" - </p><p>despite Vogel\'s requests, the project secretary (who is </p><p>responsible for inventory control) had not updated the list </p><p>for nearly a year.  A spot check of a few items showed some </p><p>discrepancies between on hand counts and the inventory.  The </p><p>motorpool supply area was supposed to have 29 Toyota filters </p><p>for various UNODC vehicles according to the inventory, but </p><p>there were only 19 on hand when the secretary counted. </p><p>Eventually, he was able to account for them through "stock- </p><p>in" and "stock-out" forms, but this required about an hour\'s </p><p>work with the files.  Similarly, we counted 316 hydro </p><p>generators stored in three locations.  These were not even </p><p>inventoried because they were "too new," according to the </p><p>secretary.  After scouring several files, he was able to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>account for 300 of the generators through various receipts. </p><p>The secretary claimed the remaining 16 had been returned to </p><p>the vendor for various reasons, but he could not produce </p><p>documentation to support this claim. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  On the non-expendable side, inventory documents </p><p>indicated about 20 Minsk motorbikes were intended for </p><p>project-related activities in the district.  However, the </p><p>inventory listed their locations as "communes."  Since there </p><p>are 180 villages in 20 communes scattered around Ky Son </p><p>district, this did not provide a very precise location.  No </p><p>project officials could say with certainty where these </p><p>motorbikes were located or how they were being used.  At an </p><p>outbrief on April 23, Vogel and project manager Phuong </p><p>pledged that they would update the inventory, keep it </p><p>current, and endeavor to account for non-expendable property </p><p>during field visits. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Subsequent to our visit, UNODC provided a summary </p><p>copy of the outside auditor\'s report for calendar year 2002. </p><p>The report recommended that, "project management should </p><p>enhance control and monitoring over the project\'s non- </p><p>expendable property." </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  Officials and the local population appear </p><p>committed to fighting drugs and very pleased that Phase II </p><p>is being implemented.  By all appearances, Phase I helped </p><p>contribute both to the virtual elimination of opium poppy </p><p>cultivation and to a general increase in the standard of </p><p>living in parts of the district.  Theoretically, UNODC\'s </p><p>checks and balances in NEX should provide assurances that </p><p>project implementation will proceed according to plan; </p><p>however, questions remain regarding the transparency of </p><p>project participation and accountability for project </p><p>material, issues about which UNODC is now even more clearly </p><p>aware and attempting to address. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
