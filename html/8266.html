(C) In the tenth week of the treason trial of MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai, police officers seized a draft </p><p>copy of Tsvangirai,s opening testimony from an MDC messenger </p><p>sent to deliver it to Tsvangirai.  The State presented a </p><p>certificate signed by the Minister of State and National </p><p>Security Nicholas Goche, exempting the head of the Central </p><p>Intelligence Organization, retired Brigadier Happyton </p><p>Bonyongwe from answering questions on payments made to Ari </p><p>Ben Menashe.  Irregularities such as these may in the end aid </p><p>the defense in its application for dismissal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Police Seize Defense Documents </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The treason trial of MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube, and MDC Shadow Minister </p><p>of Agriculture Renson Gasela continued into its tenth week on </p><p>May 19.  On that day police officers at the High Court </p><p>entrance seized a draft copy of Tsvangirai,s opening </p><p>testimony from an MDC messenger who was delivering the </p><p>document to Tsvangirai from the defense lawyers\' offices.  It </p><p>was returned after defense attorneys intervened, but the </p><p>defense team believes the police made a copy, which if true, </p><p>they fear would severely damage their case.  The defense team </p><p>filed a complaint with the Deputy Attorney General. </p><p> </p><p>CIO Witness Reveals Lies </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Only one witness took the stand this week, the head of </p><p>the Central Intelligence Organization, retired Brigadier </p><p>Happyton Bonyongwe.  Bonyongwe admitted that he did not hear </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai say he wanted to kill, murder or </p><p>assassinate Mugabe.  He also stated that Ben Menashe lied in </p><p>a press article concerning the content of the audiotape. </p><p>Despite this, Bonyongwe said he believed Menashe,s account </p><p>because of undisclosed information his office received from </p><p>other unidentified sources. </p><p> </p><p>State Suppresses Evidence </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On May 21, defense attorney George Bizos asked </p><p>Bonyongwe to produce vouchers, which Bonyongwe\'s office used </p><p>to pay Menashe.  During cross-examination, Ari Ben Menashe </p><p>had said the Central Intelligence Organization had destroyed </p><p>vouchers that provided proof of payments the GOZ had made to </p><p>him.  Bonyongwe confirmed that the vouchers had been </p><p>destroyed.  Bizos asked Bonyongwe, who had made the decision </p><p>to destroy the vouchers, whether or not he had been party to </p><p>the destruction.  Bonyongwe refused to answer. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On May 22, the prosecution produced a certificate </p><p>signed by Minister of State and National Security, Nicholas </p><p>Goche saying that it would not be appropriate for Bonyongwe </p><p>to answer questions about the vouchers for reasons of </p><p>national security.  The prosecution argued that that </p><p>information was privileged and told Garwe that Bonyongwe had </p><p>prepared an affidavit stating reasons why this information </p><p>should not be divulged in open court or in camera. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Bizos argued the information was of public interest </p><p>and had already been referred to previously in the trial. </p><p>Bizos said that Garwe could not make a judgment on </p><p>information, which had not been shown to the defense team. </p><p>Bizos also noted that it was bizarre that the date of </p><p>signature on the certificate was the May 20, yet the </p><p>questions had only been posed to Bonyongwe on the May 21. </p><p>The Deputy Attorney General was quick to state that the date </p><p>was a typing error.  Justice Garwe said he would reserve </p><p>judgment until May 28. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Attendance in court this week was very low. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Continued irregularities like the theft of the </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s draft testimony, and the intervention by </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Minister Goche to suppress evidence point to the difficulties </p><p>the defense faces in simply airing relevant evidence, and </p><p>preparing their clients for upcoming phases of the trial. </p><p>These irregularities are likely to be a double-edged sword </p><p>for the GOZ - their flagrance bolsters the defense argument </p><p>that the trial is unfair.  We still expect the defense team </p><p>to move for dismissal in the coming weeks.  End Comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
