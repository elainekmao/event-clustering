<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR </p><p>TREASURY FOR GRAO </p><p>DOC FOR ITA:  ABENAISSA, LDROKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  FTA\'S DOMINATE SRI LANKA\'S TRADE POLICY </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 1146, (B) Colombo 772 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) is </p><p>in the process of developing a coherent trade </p><p>policy, focused on increasing market access for Sri </p><p>Lankan goods through free trade agreements.  Two US </p><p>Representatives who recently were in Sri Lanka on a </p><p>private visit sponsored by a local business chamber </p><p>(to be reported septel) heard much about GSL\'s </p><p>ambitious plans for negotiating FTAs.  Aiming to </p><p>create economic growth and ease the adjustment to </p><p>the post-Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) world, the GSL </p><p>wants Sri Lanka to become the region\'s trading hub, </p><p>connected through a series of bilateral </p><p>arrangements.  Sri Lanka is now deepening economic </p><p>ties with India under a comprehensive economic </p><p>partnership and is looking in other directions, </p><p>especially toward the US.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Sri Lanka aims for 30 FTAs... </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On June 26, in an interview with "Daily News," </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s Commerce Minister said he wanted to </p><p>sign over 30 FTAs, with countries primarily in SE </p><p>Asia and the Middle East.  These agreements are </p><p>intended to help combat the negative impact of the </p><p>termination of the MFA, which favors Sri Lanka by </p><p>limiting external competition to its all-important </p><p>apparel exports. Heavily dependent on exports, Sri </p><p>Lankans are worried by the free trade arrangements </p><p>and concessions which allow other low-income </p><p>countries quota- and tariff-free access to some </p><p>developed markets, especially the EU. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The GSL hopes to utilize FTAs and the country\'s </p><p>strategic location to become a regional hub for </p><p>trade, manufacturing and transport.  Emphasizing </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s advantages to British investors in </p><p>London last week, Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe referred to trade liberalization as </p><p>one of the key pillars of his government\'s economic </p><p>reforms program.  He said that Sri Lanka\'s goal is </p><p>to reduce barriers and maximize access to key </p><p>markets throughout the region and the world.  He </p><p>also reiterated the Government\'s interest in </p><p>pursuing multiple free trade agreements. </p><p> </p><p>4.  INDO-LANKA FTA:  Sri Lanka\'s first free trade </p><p>arrangement, the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(ILFTA), covering only goods, has been in operation </p><p>since March 2000.  Although the agreement has </p><p>doubled two-way trade between India and Sri Lanka </p><p>to almost $1 billion, it is far from a perfect FTA, </p><p>being flawed by large negative lists on each side </p><p>(see ref B for a fuller assessment of the </p><p>agreement).  Planning to expand the ILFTA, the </p><p>Prime Ministers of the two countries met in March, </p><p>and agreed in principle to enter into an Economic </p><p>Partnership Agreement (EPA).  Currently, an Indo- </p><p>Lanka Study group is exploring areas of cooperation </p><p>including trade in services, investment, IPR </p><p>protection, electronic trade, trade facilitation, </p><p>and movement of persons in order to formulate a </p><p>framework agreement. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OTHER FTAS:  In addition to the ILFTA, talks are </p><p>getting underway for FTAs with Pakistan and Egypt. </p><p>(The Egyptian Ambassador told us the last trade </p><p>talks with Sri Lanka had taken place six years ago </p><p>but said the current Commerce Minister was eager to </p><p>get a new round started.)  Pakistan and Sri Lanka </p><p>have already signed a framework agreement, but </p><p>conclusion of the final agreement has been delayed </p><p>due to disagreement over access of agricultural </p><p>commodities.  Sri Lanka also plans to discuss an </p><p>FTA with Bangladesh.  Working regionally, Sri Lanka </p><p>actively participates with Bangladesh, India, </p><p>Myanmar, and Thailand (together, the so-called </p><p>BIMST grouping) in an effort to create a free trade </p><p>agreement among BIMST-Economic Commission </p><p>countries.  In June, the group held negotiations in </p><p>Colombo on a draft framework agreement for a BIMST </p><p>area-FTA.  This agreement is expected to be signed </p><p>at the next meeting of BIMST heads of state in </p><p>February 2004.  According to sources at the Sri </p><p>Lankan Department of Commerce (DOC), most of the </p><p>other FTAs are still in conceptual stage. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>...as SAARC trade liberalization stalls </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  These attempts to open markets through other </p><p>trade agreements, especially the ILFTA, show the </p><p>lack of progress on a South Asia Free Trade </p><p>Agreement (SAFTA) mooted by South Asian Association </p><p>for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).  For the past </p><p>several years, the South Asian nations have been </p><p>formulating a framework agreement for a SAFTA, </p><p>originally planned to come into effect by 2005. </p><p>According to DOC sources, SAARC officials will meet </p><p>in Nepal later in July in a bid to finalize a </p><p>framework agreement. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Meanwhile, the success of South Asian </p><p>Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA), the </p><p>precursor to SAFTA, which came into force in </p><p>December 1995, has also been limited.  After three </p><p>rounds of negotiations, SAPTA covers only about 10% </p><p>of tariff lines.  This is perhaps because no </p><p>country has seriously considered promoting intra- </p><p>regional trade by including most traded commodities </p><p>under the agreement.  The exchange of tariff </p><p>concessions under SAPTA came to a standstill from </p><p>1998-2001, due to political problems between India </p><p>and Pakistan, two key members of SAARC.  The fourth </p><p>round of SAPTA talks was held in December 2001 but </p><p>member countries are yet to exchange tariff </p><p>concessions agreed at this round. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>But a US FTA would set a new standard </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  While pursuing new markets through free trade </p><p>arrangements, the GSL is anxious to move forward </p><p>with the US Trade and Investment Framework </p><p>Agreement (TIFA) process and on to a comprehensive </p><p>FTA.  From the GSL point of view, a FTA with US is </p><p>vitally important to stay competitive in its </p><p>largest export market.  Unlike its other regional </p><p>and bi-lateral agreements, however, the higher </p><p>standards and more comprehensive nature of a US FTA </p><p>will require that Sri Lanka overhaul its regulatory </p><p>regime and practices.  As described in ref A, Sri </p><p>Lanka is beginning to understand just how high US </p><p>standards are for FTAs, as it studies the Singapore </p><p>and Chile texts as possible models. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Given this nation\'s dependence on trade, as </p><p>well as its ongoing reform agenda, relatively open </p><p>market and small size, Sri Lanka appears to be the </p><p>South Asian nation best suited to become a free </p><p>trade hub.  While GSL may intellectually understand </p><p>the level of liberalization required under a US </p><p>FTA, it will need to prove it has the capacity and </p><p>political will to carry out the necessary reforms. </p><p>In particular, the government will need to lower </p><p>tariffs and further open the agriculture and </p><p>services markets, as well as improve intellectual </p><p>property protection, transparency and the </p><p>regulatory regime.  An FTA with the US would also </p><p>establish new standards for the labor and </p><p>environment sectors.  Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>efforts to conclude more limited agreements </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
