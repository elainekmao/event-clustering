Kathmandu 2492 </p><p>      B.  Kathmandu 2490 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  The GON said it is receptive to and ready to create an </p><p>environment for peace talks with the Maoists.  Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Chand said the GON will accede to the </p><p>Maoists\' demand for information on imprisoned rebels. </p><p>Despite the GON\'s conciliatory gestures, the Maoists have </p><p>called another two-day bandh for February to protest King </p><p>Gyanendra\'s dismissal of the elected government and </p><p>continued their campaign of violence.  Maoists killed six </p><p>civilians, including two children and a young widow whom </p><p>they hacked to death, and injured seven others in separate </p><p>bombing incidents.  The rebels also killed three policemen </p><p>and injured seven members of the Armed Police Force (APF) in </p><p>separate attacks.  Two policemen are still missing from an </p><p>attack on a police post.  Six students were abducted at </p><p>gunpoint by the Maoists and their whereabouts are still </p><p>unknown.  Maoists set off several bombs in the downtown </p><p>Kathmandu area, bombed several Village Development Committee </p><p>(VDC) buildings, set fire to a large residence, and looted </p><p>rice, cotton and fertilizer from a Cotton Development </p><p>Office.  India reportedly arrested three Maoists from Nepal. </p><p>Nepali human rights groups continued to decry the human </p><p>rights violations by both the GON and the Maoists, invoking </p><p>the Geneva Convention and opposing the purchase of weapons </p><p>by the GON. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO MAOIST DEMANDS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Speaking at a tribute to the late King Birendra, Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said the GON is ready to </p><p>reveal the locations and names of Maoist rebels currently </p><p>imprisoned throughout the country.  Maoist leaders have </p><p>demanded the information as one of their preconditions for a </p><p>peace dialogue.  Chand said the only way to achieve peace is </p><p>through dialogue and the GON will do its part, but the </p><p>Maoists will have to take positive steps as well.  Chand </p><p>called for an end to the violence and murder of innocent </p><p>people, saying that such acts are not an acceptable means to </p><p>fulfill political ambitions, but only serve to deprive </p><p>Nepali people of their rights. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CALL ANOTHER TWO-DAY STRIKE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Maoists have called for another nationwide two-day </p><p>strike on February 13-14.  The strike ostensibly is being </p><p>called to protest King Gyanendra\'s dismissal of the elected </p><p>government and to express their anger at what Maoist leader </p><p>Prachanda says is the "suspension of the people\'s sovereign </p><p>rights." </p><p> </p><p>4.  The two-day bandh called by the Maoists on December 29- </p><p>30 for the Bagmati and Narayani districts, including the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley, passed largely without incident (ref A). </p><p>However, most businesses and schools were shut down and few </p><p>vehicles were on the streets.  Nepal saw an unprecedented </p><p>number of bandhs in 2002, particularly educational bandhs. </p><p>According to press reports, there were a total of 39 bandh </p><p>days, of which 17 were educational bandhs. </p><p> </p><p>NO END IN SIGHT TO MAOIST BRUTALITY AND DESTRUCTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  On December 29 Maoist rebels forcibly entered a home in </p><p>Gulariya, southern Bardiga District, and brutally killed a </p><p>twenty-five year old mother by chopping off her legs and </p><p>driving nails into her palms.  On December 28 Maoists threw </p><p>a grenade into a home in southern Dang District, killing </p><p>four members of a family, including a two year-old child. </p><p>Maoists also killed a fourteen-year-old child and injured </p><p>seven others in neighboring Salyan District by throwing a </p><p>bomb into a tea shop.  On December 27 Maoists bombed a </p><p>school dormitory in Kathmandu, injuring five children, a </p><p>teacher and a principal (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>6.  Maoist assaults on policemen and police posts continued </p><p>throughout Nepal.  On January 2 seven members of the Armed </p><p>Police Force (APF), including the superintendent, were </p><p>injured by a Maoist landmine in the Dang District.  Two </p><p>policemen were killed at a temporary police post in southern </p><p>Bara District on December 28 when rebels ambushed the post </p><p>and then blew it up.  Two policemen from the post are still </p><p>missing.  In the Kailali District, armed Maoists surrounded </p><p>a police officer\'s home and kidnapped him.  His mutilated </p><p>body was discovered on December 29. </p><p> </p><p>7.  On December 27 Maoists set fire to a large residence in </p><p>central Nuwakot District, causing damage of over one hundred </p><p>and fifty thousand dollars.  The Maoists also looted gold </p><p>and money from the building before destroying it.  Maoists </p><p>also bombed a statue of the late King Mahendra in the Bara </p><p>District, totally destroying it.  Several bombs went off in </p><p>the Kathmandu Valley on December 28, including one at a </p><p>central shopping area (New Road), and Gongabu Village </p><p>Development Committee (VDC) facilities.  No injuries were </p><p>reported.  Police in eastern Siraha District were able to </p><p>diffuse three pressure cooker bombs that were planted near a </p><p>main road.  Maoist rebels bombed and destroyed a Cotton </p><p>Development Office in southern Bardia District on December </p><p>25 and looted rice, cotton and fertilizer.  Two VDC office </p><p>buildings in southern Parsa District were destroyed after </p><p>being bombed by Maoists on December 27. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists entered a high school in eastern Bhojpur </p><p>District and abducted six students at gunpoint.  The </p><p>students, all boys, were taken to an unknown location and </p><p>have yet to be released. </p><p> </p><p>GLUTTONOUS MAOISTS CLEAN OUT HOMES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Villagers already in fear for their lives now have to </p><p>worry about Maoists depleting their personal food supplies. </p><p>It is becoming common for Maoists to enter a home and stay </p><p>until they have consumed all the food supplies.  The rebels, </p><p>locally known as "Maobadis" or Maoist fanatics, have become </p><p>so greedy that villagers have started calling them </p><p>"khaobadis" or eating fanatics.  Villagers, already </p><p>struggling to feed themselves and their families, now worry </p><p>that they will be forced to feed the "khaobadis." </p><p> </p><p>INDIA ARRESTS NEPALI MAOISTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Three Maoist rebels, including a senior leader of the </p><p>All-Nepal National Free Students Union--Revolutionary </p><p>(ANNFSU-R), were reportedly arrested on December 29 outside </p><p>Siliguri, near Darjeeling.  Police officials said the rebels </p><p>were heading to Patna to attend a meeting with the People\'s </p><p>War Group and the Maoist Communist Center, two Indian Maoist </p><p>groups.  The arrests came after India recently increased </p><p>security along the India-Nepal border. </p><p> </p><p>11.  L.K. Advani, Deputy Prime Minister of India, voiced </p><p>concern that Maoists from Nepal have increased their efforts </p><p>to infiltrate India and step up their campaign of violence. </p><p> </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WANT GENEVA PACT IMPLEMENTED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  Representatives from the Human Rights and Alternative </p><p>Development Academy and the Indigenous Human Rights and </p><p>Concern Society filed a writ petition in Nepal\'s Supreme </p><p>Court, demanding that GON be ordered, under the Geneva </p><p>Convention, to protect human rights.  The petition claims </p><p>that the Geneva Convention can be invoked because of Nepal\'s </p><p>current internal conflict. </p><p>13. Kapil Shrestha, member of the National Human Rights </p><p>Commission, called for zero tolerance of human rights </p><p>violations by both the Maoists and the GON and demanded that </p><p>the Maoists immediately declare a cease-fire.  The Human </p><p>Rights and Peace Society (HURPES), a non-governmental </p><p>organization in Kathmandu, released its own paper on </p><p>December 28 accusing the GON of gross human rights </p><p>violations and the Maoists of violating international </p><p>humanitarian laws. </p><p> </p><p>14. Lakshmi Rai, of the National Women\'s Commission, </p><p>expressed anger that the identities of the rape victims in </p><p>Amnesty International\'s recent human rights report were made </p><p>public.  Rai expressed concern over the revelations and </p><p>airing of video footage of the alleged rape victims, saying </p><p>that it will only serve to ostracize the girls and subject </p><p>them to further victimization.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>has publicly denied the rape charges. </p><p> </p><p>15.  A local human rights group decried the purchase of </p><p>weapons by the GON, saying the arrival of the Belgian arms </p><p>was not conducive to peace talks.  Radha Krishna Mainali, </p><p>committee member of the Communist Party of Nepal-United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), questioned the purchase by the </p><p>GON, saying the deal made it hard to hope for peace. </p><p></p></div>
