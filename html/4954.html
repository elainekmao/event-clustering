<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000013 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/R/MR </p><p>INFO AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS; AF/S RAYNOR </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S./IRAQ/NORTH KOREA STANDOFF; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   With headline "Under the specter of a third world </p><p>      war," the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its January 5 editorial to encouraging the </p><p>      United States, at a time when a military showdown </p><p>      against Iraq seems inevitable, to resolve the </p><p>      nuclear standoff with North Korea peacefully. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "In a statement he made last week, United </p><p>      States. . .President, George W. Bush, said he hoped </p><p>      the crisis over Iraqi arms could be overcome </p><p>      peacefully, to which the Iraqis retorted by saying </p><p>      that `the dog\'s tail will never be straight,\' and </p><p>      that it was hard to believe the American leader had </p><p>      `suddenly become rational.\'  Indeed, Bush\'s </p><p>      statement was hard to believe, especially so when </p><p>      the U. S. has already assembled forces for possible </p><p>      military action in the Gulf region.  Besides, </p><p>      Washington has already invoked the phrase that could </p><p>      trigger a war, accusing Iraq of being in `material </p><p>      breach\' of resolution 1441, the U. N. Security </p><p>      Council resolution designed to force Iraq to give up </p><p>      all weapons of mass destruction and threatening </p><p>      `serious consequences\' if it did not comply. . .As </p><p>      the world waits anxiously for January 27, the date </p><p>      on which the U. N. weapons inspectors are required </p><p>      to report on their progress to the Security Council, </p><p>      the threat of war hangs ominously in the air.  For, </p><p>      any report within the January 27 deadline that the </p><p>      inspectors\' work is being obstructed could lead to </p><p>      an infliction of the `serious consequences\' on Iraq, </p><p>      as spelt out in resolution 1441. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Complicating this already war-charged atmosphere is </p><p>      North Korea\'s New Year\'s Eve expulsion of U. N. </p><p>      inspectors and its threats to withdraw from the non- </p><p>      proliferation treaty, under which it promised not to </p><p>      acquire nuclear weapons.  Apparently, Korea secretly </p><p>      developed a uranium-enrichment program at its </p><p>      Yongbyon plant, even as U. N. inspectors were </p><p>      monitoring the country.  It boldly declared its </p><p>      right to bear nuclear arms, arguing that after being </p><p>      described by Mr. Bush as part of an `axis of evil,\' </p><p>      along with Iran and Iraq, it considered itself a </p><p>      target of U. S. aggression.  America\'s insistence </p><p>      that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear program before </p><p>      any talks could resume may have to soften in the </p><p>      face of certain recalcitrance by the Koreans. </p><p>      Otherwise, a rigid approach to resolving this </p><p>      stalemate may likely lead to war." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
