<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 03741 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, KPAL, KPRP, JO, IS, LE, IS, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SYRIA CONSIDERS ITSELF A TRUE CONFRONTATION </p><p>STATE--EVERYTHING THAT CONTRIBUTES TO DEFEATING THE </p><p>ENEMY IS POSITIVE.  THE "STRUGGLE" PROVIDES A GUIDE </p><p>FOR CHOOSING THE TARGET AND LEGITIMIZES THE MEANS, </p><p>INCLUDING TERRORISM, WHICH IS VIEWED AS COST-EFFECTIVE. </p><p>SYRIA IS HOST TO PLENTY OF WILLING HELPERS, PRIMARILY </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED AND RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS, </p><p>BUT ALSO KURDS AND ARMENIANS.  AS LONG AS COMMON FOES </p><p>ARE TARGETED,  SYRIA TOLERATES TERRORIST ACTIONS BY </p><p>OTHERS.  RETALIATION AGAINST SYRIA WOULD HAVE PROBLEMATIC </p><p>EFFECTS, AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DETER FUTURE TERRORISM. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SYRIA HAS A RECORD OF SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND </p><p>A HISTORY OF HARBORING GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE </p><p>IN TERRORIST ACTS.  SYRIA HAS ALSO BEEN A VICTIM OF </p><p>A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTIONS.  SYRIA </p><p>CONSIDERS ITSELF A CONFRONTATION STATE IN THE PURE SENSE-- </p><p>IT IS AT WAR WITH ISRAEL AND EVERYTHING THAT CONTRIBUTES </p><p>TO THE EFFORT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY IS POSITIVE.  SPECIFIC </p><p>TERRORIST OPERATIONS WILL B MOUNTED OR NOT, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THIS CRITERION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  OTHER ARAB STATES WHOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL IS </p><p>NOT JURIDICALLY ONE OF PEACE DO NOT CONDONE OR PROMOTE </p><p>TERRORISM.  IN THIS MESSAGE WE EXAMINE SOME ASPECTS OF </p><p>SYRIA THAT MAKE IT DIFFERENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHAT MAKES SYRIA DIFFERENT? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BA\'THI,  MINORITY GOVERNMENT OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD IS </p><p>BUILT UPON AN IDEOLOGY THAT INCREASINGLY HAS COME TO </p><p>FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF SYRIA\'S ROLE IN CONFRONTING THE </p><p>"ZIONIST ENEMY," ISRAEL.  SYRIA PERCEIVES THAT IT </p><p>STANDS ALONE AMONG THE STATES NEIGHBORING ISRAEL IN </p><p>PROMOTING "REAL" CONFRONTATION, SINCE JORDAN AND EGYPT </p><p>HAVE FALLEN FROM GRACE  INTO "CAPITULATIONISM," LEBANON </p><p>HAS TURNED INWARD, AND IRAQ HAS SHIFTED TOWARDS THE </p><p>ARAB RIGHT.  SYRIA\'S REGIONAL ISOLATION--AS A RADICAL </p><p>STATE WITH TIES TO IRAN AND LIBYA--ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO </p><p>THE STRONG SENSE OF UNIQUENESS FELT BY THE SYRIAN LEADER- </p><p>SHIP.  GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY ARE ADDITIONAL FACTORS: </p><p>SYRIA IS STRATEGICALLY PLACED ON THE CROSSROADS OF THE </p><p>LEVANT WITH ACCESS TO AND VULNERABILITY FROM MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.  DEMOGRAPHICALLY, SYRIA\'S </p><p>POPULATION IS HETEROGENOUS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF PALESTINIANS, KURDS, AND ARMENIANS. </p><p>THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SYRIA WHO HAVE </p><p>GRIEVANCES AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE, SOMEWHERE ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES SYRIA, HOWEVER, IS ITS </p><p>CANDID ASSESSMENT THAT TERRORISM IS COST EFFECTIVE. </p><p>IN PART, THIS IS A FUNCTION OF THE DETERRENTS TO ANY </p><p>DIRECT MILITARY ACTION POSED BY SUPERIOR ISRAELI FORCES </p><p>OR ARAB OPINION.  SYRIA IS ALSO NOT THE FIRST REGIME </p><p>TO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ONE EFFECTIVE WAY OF DEALING </p><p>WITH POLITICAL OPPOSITION IS TO EXTINGUISH IT.  ANOTHER </p><p>FACTOR WHICH WE CANNOT ASSESS PRECISELY IS THE EXTENT </p><p>AND NATURE OF SOVIET SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES </p><p>WHICH MAY BE DIRECTED FROM SYRIA.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS </p><p>NOT FAR FETCHED TO CONCEIVE OF A SOVIET ROLE IN PROMOTING </p><p>INSURGENT ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE KURDS AGAINST TURKEY </p><p>OR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OTHER GROUPS AGAINST </p><p>EUROPEAN TARGETS.  (THE SOVIETS HERE STOUTLY MAINTAIN </p><p>THEIR OPPOSITION TO, AND NON-INVOLVEMENT IN, ANY SUCH </p><p>ACTIVITIES.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  SYRIA DOES NOT LABEL THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE </p><p>ISRAELI ENEMY AS "TERRORISM."  INDEED, IT IS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS WITH MOST AVERAGE SYRIANS THE ISSUE </p><p>OF TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL; IT IS CONSIDERED AN </p><p>OXYMORON, I.E., IF AMERICANS FOUGHT TO LIBERATE THEIR </p><p>LAND FROM BRITISH OCCUPIERS, THEN LEBANESE AND </p><p>PALESTINIANS ARE ALSO FREEDOM FIGHTERS, NOT TERRORISTS. </p><p>MOREOVER, SYRIA DEFINES THE "NATIONAL RESISTANCE" </p><p>BROADLY, SO THAT MODERATE ARABS BECOME LEGITIMATE </p><p>TARGETS.  BUT THE OBJNCTIVES ARE ALWAYS THE SAME--UNTIL </p><p>SUCH TIME AS THE ARABS ARE UNITED AND STRONG, SYRIA MUST </p><p>WEAKEN THE ENEMY, DISCOURAGE INDEPENDENT ARAB INITIATIVES, </p><p>AND BLOCK A MODERATE CONSENSUS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO </p><p>SHORTAGE OF DISAFFECTED, RADICAL PALESTINIANS WHO ARE </p><p>PREPARED TO ACT NOT ONLY AGAINST THE ISRAELIS BUT, </p><p>MORE IMPORTANTLY, AGAINST THE JORDANIANS AND MODERATE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  THERE ARE WILLING RECRUITS HERE AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE FOR MANY OF THE ACTIONS WHICH COMMONLY ARE </p><p>LABELED SYRIAN-SPONSORED BUT WHICH IN FACT ARE CONDUCTED </p><p>WITHOUT EXPLICIT SYRIAN APPROVAL.  SINCE SYRIA DOES NOT </p><p>GENERALLY OBJECT TO TARGETTING  A COMMON FOE, IT MIGHT, </p><p>THEREFORE, BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CALL THESE TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIONS SYRIAN-TOLERATED. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>TARGETS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  ALMOST ANY TARGET IS "LEGITIMATE."  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>PROBABILITY OF A TERRORIST ACT, AS WELL AS ITS LINKAGE </p><p>TO SYRIA, RISES WITH THE DEGREE OF THE TARGET\'S </p><p>ASSOCIATION WITH ISRAEL OR A PEACE PROCESS THAT DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE SYRIAN APPROVAL.  THUS, SYRIA PROBABLY AT WORST </p><p>TOLERATES AND AT BEST IS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL TERRORISM </p><p>SUCH AS THAT BY ARMENIANS OR KURDS AGAINST TURKS.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, IT COOPERATES ACTIVELY IN TERRORISM </p><p>DIRECTED AGAINST JORDAN, WHEN THE PEACE PROCESS SHOWS LIFE. </p><p>SOMETIMES SYRIA\'S HAND IS QUITE DIRECT, AS IN THE CASES </p><p>OF ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATIONS OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>FIGURES ABROAD AND IN ATTACKS AGAINST IRAQI CITIZENS </p><p>AND FACILITIES.  MORE OFTEN, "FRIENDS" DO THE DIRTY </p><p>WORK.  THUS, THE CRAZY-QUILT OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN </p><p>DAMASCUS ALL OCCASIONALLY GET THEIR CHANCE AT THE </p><p>JORDANIANS, FATAH, OR THE ISRAELIS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RETALIATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p>10.  SINCE THE IDEA OF RETALIATION FOR A TERRORIST ACT </p><p>HAS OCCURRED TO ALL AT SOME POINT, IT IS WORTH CONSIDER- </p><p>ING IN THE CASE OF SYRIA.  OBVIOUSLY, THE GREATEST </p><p>DIFFICULTY IS IN ESTABLISHING SYRIAN COMPLICITY.  THAT </p><p>ASIDE, RETALIATION WOULD MEET HERE WITH A CONTRADICTORY </p><p>RANGE OF EMOTIONS:  IT WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN TYPICALLY </p><p>MIDDLE EAST FASHION, BUT IT WOULD NOT DETER, BECAUSE </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE TERRORIST ACTIONS THI </p><p>CAUSE AND THEIR DEDICATION TO IT ARE PARAMOUNT.  MORE- </p><p>OVER, FAILURE OF A RETALIATORY ACTION COULD BE </p><p>DISASTROUS.  U.S. POLICY WOULD HAVE TO BE PERCEIVED TO </p><p>BE DIRECT, ACCURATE, AND EFFECTIVE.  (THE IMAGE OF U.S. </p><p>ABILITY TO RESPOND IS THREATENED BY OUR PRESUMED ASSOCIA- </p><p>TION WITH EVENTS SUCH AS THE BIR AL-ABID CAR BOMBING IN </p><p>WEST BEIRUT, NOT TO MENTION THE DECEMBER 1983 AIR STRIKE </p><p>IN THE BIQA\' WHICH RESULTED IN CAPTURE OF A U.S. FLYER.) </p><p>FINALLY, RETALIATION IS A FAVORITE ISRAELI POLICY WHICH </p><p>MOST TERRORIST ANALYSTS ACKNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER WORKED. </p><p>THE U.S. COULD END UP ADDING TO THE PROBLEM BY FURTHER </p><p>ALIENATING ARAB OPINION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED UPON THE QUESTION OF PREEMPTION </p><p>BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW, GIVEN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, </p><p>PREEMPTION WOULD SEEM TO BE LOGICAL AND NECESSARY IF IT </p><p>IS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  FINALLY, IRANIAN- AND LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM, </p><p>WHICH TAINTS SYRIA BY ASSOCIATION, IS NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>APPROVED OR EVEN CONDONED BY SYRIA.  A GOOD EXAMPLE IS </p><p>HOSTAGE-TAKING IN LEBANON.  THERE IS LITTLE SYRIA CAN </p><p>DO TO PREVENT SUCH ACTIONS WITHOUT PAYING A HIGH PRICE </p><p>IN OTHER NATIONAL INTERESTS.  SYRIA COULD DO MUCH MORE, </p><p>WE BELIEVE, TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOSTAGES AFTER THEY </p><p>ARE TAKEN, BUT PREVENTION OF INDIVIDUAL TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>SUCH AS THOSE OCCURRING NOW IN BEIRUT, IS PROBABLY NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
