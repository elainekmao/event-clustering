The </p><p>story reports that the US had earlier conveyed a list of </p><p>requests from Turkey for a possible operation in Iraq </p><p>through a letter to the Turkish Ambassador in Washington. </p><p>The letter reportedly included a request for 35,000 Turkish </p><p>troops to be held in reserve for possible intervention in </p><p>Northern Iraq, the use of Turkish air bases, the use of </p><p>Turkish territory for US ground troops, and the use of </p><p>several ports.   The letter also reportedly included a </p><p>December 8 deadline for response, and Grossman and Wolfowitz </p><p>will attempt to learn Ankara\'s initial reaction today. </p><p>Papers listed the predominant issues for the visit as Iraq, </p><p>the EU, and Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan to Parliament: Turkey\'s Supreme Election Board (YSK) </p><p>ruled on Monday that the elections in the southeastern city </p><p>of Siirt will be canceled.  The decision came after the AKP </p><p>applied to the YSK to cancel the elections in Siirt because </p><p>of irregularities in three ballot boxes.  According to YSK </p><p>procedures, the elections in Siirt will be repeated 60 days </p><p>following the cancellation decision, i.e. in February 2003. </p><p>All papers highlight this development as the opportunity for </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan to be elected to parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  Papers note the increasing number of diplomatic </p><p>visitors, and comment that the pressure on the Cyprus issue </p><p>is mounting.  Greek FM Papandreou reportedly changed his </p><p>program to come to Ankara a day early in order to meet U/S </p><p>Grossman to discuss the Cyprus issue.  The visits of UN </p><p>Representative De Soto, the Danish Foreign Minister, and </p><p>British FM Straw are portrayed as efforts to `increase </p><p>pressure on the Cyprus issue prior to the EU summit.\' </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Grossman and Wolfowitz visit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cards Uncovered on Iraq" </p><p>Chief columnist of mass appeal Hurriyet, Oktay Eksi wrote </p><p>(12/3): "It seems that the US has finally expressed its </p><p>demands and expectations from Turkey on the Iraq issue and </p><p>presented them formally to the Turkish side.  . All of the </p><p>reported demands obviously serve US interests both in the </p><p>short and long term.  They require, however, careful </p><p>evaluation by Turkey based on Turkish interests. . Let\'s not </p><p>forget the fact that once the Iraq operation takes place, </p><p>the US will leave the region.  It will be Turkey that will </p><p>be faced with the reality of Iraq as its immediate neighbor. </p><p>This reality alone invalidates the possibility of `Turkish </p><p>soldiers in combat against Iraq.\'  After all, why do we have </p><p>to get involved in the US operation against Iraq?  Clearly </p><p>this is going to happen largely because of US oil </p><p>interests." </p><p></p></div>
