(C) SUMMARY: VATICAN COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR CARIBBEAN </p><p>STATES MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA TOLD POLOFF JANUARY 7 THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S MAIN CONCERN IN VENEZUELA IS TO SEE TENSIONS </p><p>REDUCED AND THE PARTIES WORKING TOWARDS AN AUGUST 2003 </p><p>REFERENDUM, AS PERMITTED BY THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION.  THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S DECEMBER 2002 STATEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT THE CHURCH IN VENEZUELA, AFTER THE SHOOTINGS ON </p><p>PLAYA FRANCIA DE ALTAMYRA, IS PULLING BACK ITS PREVIOUS </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO HELP AVOID A </p><p>VIOLENT DENOUEMENT. THE HOLY SEE IS OPEN TO A "FRIENDS OF </p><p>VENEZUELA" PROCESS ONLY IF IT IS MADE A PART OF GAVIRIAS\' </p><p>BRIEF (ASSUMING THAT LULA DA SILVA WOULD HAVE A MODERATING </p><p>EFFECT ON CHAVEZ).  LINGUA WAS UNSURE WHETHER THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WOULD URGE THE PARTIES TO ASK GAVIRIAS TO TABLE A CONCRETE </p><p>PROPOSAL.  WHILE THE HOLY SEE APPEARS TO BE IN CLOSE CONTACT </p><p>WITH BOTH THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS AND ITS NUNCIO, ITS ABILITY </p><p>TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THEIR POSITIONS IS LIMITED.  EMBASSY </p><p>CARACAS MAY WISH TO WORK WITH PAPAL NUNCIO DUPUY IN ADVANCE </p><p>OF HIS ANNUAL GREETING TO PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AS DEAN OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS, TO MAKE SURE HE IS ON MESSAGE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  POLOFF SHARED REF A POINTS ON THE VENEZUELAN CRISIS </p><p>JANUARY 8 WITH VATICAN CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. </p><p>GIORGIO LINGUA.  LINGUA SAID THE HOLY SEE\'S WAS VERY </p><p>CONCERNED AT THE INCREASE IN CIVIL STRIFE SINCE WE LAST SPOKE </p><p>(REF B).  HE INDICATED THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S </p><p>DECEMBER 2002 STATEMENT SHOWED THAT THE CHURCH, AFTER THE </p><p>SHOOTINGS ON PLAYA FRANCIA DE ALTAMYRA, WAS BACKING AWAY FROM </p><p>ITS PREVIOUS STRONG AND OPEN SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION. </p><p>LANGUAGE IN THAT STATEMENT WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE CONTINUED </p><p>SUFFERING OF VENEZUELA\'S POOREST, HOWEVER, WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO BUILD BRIDGES TO CHAVEZ.  RATHER, ACCORDING TO LINGUA, IT </p><p>INDICATED THE BISHOPS WERE TRYING TO ATTRACT CHAVEZ </p><p>SUPPORTERS AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT. INDEED THE STATEMENT </p><p>CALLED ON MEDIA, THE GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY FORCES TO AVOID </p><p>INFLAMING THE SITUATION.  IT EXHORTED THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS AND ESCHEW "STANDING ON LEGALISMS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z </p><p>POLITICAL STRATEGIES" THAT THREATEN THE SOCIAL FABRIC.    THE </p><p>HOLY SEE REMAINS FEARFUL THAT, IN THE BISHOPS\' WORDS, A </p><p>VIOLENT "SOCIAL FRACTURE" REMAINS A GREATER POSSIBILITY TODAY </p><p>THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE GENERAL STRIKE.  YET THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>NO PLANS AT THIS TIME ACTIVELY TO ENGAGE IN THE DIALOGUE. </p><p>LINGUA REITERATED HIS MESSAGE FROM REF B, THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>HOPED ALL PARTIES WOULD CALM DOWN AND ORGANIZE POLITICALLY TO </p><p>CONTEST A REFERENDUM ON THE CHAVEZ PRESIDENCY IN AUGUST OF </p><p>THIS YEAR, AS IS PERMITTED IN THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION. </p><p>LINGUA OPINED THAT CHAVEZ WAS LOSING SUPPORT AS THE STRIKE </p><p>PROCEEDED (EVEN AS THE STRIKE APPEARED TO BE WINDING DOWN), </p><p>AND THAT OVER THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND AUGUST THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S ABILITY TO CARRY THE REFERENDUM WOULD GROW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) LINGUA SAID THE VATICAN WAS OPEN TO A "FRIENDS OF </p><p>VENEZUELA" PROCESS ONLY IF IT WAS MADE A PART OF GAVIRIAS\' </p><p>BRIEF, BUT WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE A FRIENDS GROUP IF IT </p><p>COMPETED (AND THUS DISTRACTED) FROM THE OAS ENVOY\'S WORK.  HE </p><p>BELIEVED THAT BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT LULA DA SILVA MIGHT BE ABLE </p><p>TO EXERCISE A MODERATING INFLUENCE ON CHAVEZ.  LINGUA WAS </p><p>UNSURE WHETHER THE HOLY SEE WOULD ISSUE A PUBLIC CALL TO </p><p>SUPPORT GAVIRIAS\' WORK.  HE WAS ALSO NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT HOLY </p><p>SEE ENGAGEMENT IN THE PLAN TO HAVE GAVIRIAS TABLE A CONCRETE </p><p>PLAN AROUND WHICH THE PARTIES COULD BEGIN DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  ASKED WHETHER PAPAL NUNCIO DUPUY WOULD GREET </p><p>PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AGAIN THIS YEAR AS DEAN OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CORPS, LINGUA SAID HE HADN\'T YET HEARD.  HE SPECULATED THAT </p><p>THE ANNUAL MEETING MIGHT BE POSTPONED THIS YEAR, GIVEN THE </p><p>SITUATION ON THE STREETS.  LINGUA WRYLY NOTED THAT IF THE </p><p>NUNCIO TRULY SPOKE HIS MIND AGAIN HE MIGHT BE PNG\'D. (NOTE: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z </p><p>SOME MAY RECALL THAT DUPUY\'S URGING OF CHAVEZ IN REMARKS LAST </p><p>JANUARY TO MAKE SPACE FOR THE OPPOSITION\'S DEMANDS PROMPTED </p><p>FROM THE LATTER A VITUPERATIVE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH AS A </p><p>"PARASITE ON VENEZUELAN SOCIETY.")  LINGUA TOLD US THAT </p><p>NUNCIOS USUALLY DRAFT THEIR ANNUAL REMARKS WITHOUT CLEARING </p><p>THEM WITH THE HOLY SEE, AND THAT THEY WOULD GENERALLY AIM FOR </p><p>REMARKS THAT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS AS </p><p>OPPOSED TO THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE HOLY SEE IS FEARFUL THAT IF IT WERE TO </p><p>ENGAGE MORE ACTIVELY IN BRINGING THE VENEZUELAN PARTIES </p><p>TOGETHER, ITS OWN POOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHAVEZ </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, EXEMPLIFIED IN CHAVEZ\' REACTION TO THE </p><p>NUNCIO\'S JANUARY 2002 COMMENTS, WOULD BE MADE EVEN WORSE. </p><p>THIS COULD HAVE UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE CLERGY </p><p>AND FAITHFUL WHO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION.  LINGUA\'S REACTIONS </p><p>SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE HOLY SEE IS NOT FULLY IN CONTROL </p><p>OF THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS, NOR OF ITS OWN NUNCIO.  WE WOULD </p><p>BE INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM EMBASSY CARACAS WHETHER THEY ARE </p><p>CONSULTING WITH DUPUY ON HIS REMARKS, IF ANY, AT THIS YEAR\'S </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7464 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00105  02 OF 02  101651Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   ACE-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------234649  101651Z /38 </p><p>P 101627Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CARACAS PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, VE, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPPORTING OAS SYG GAVIRIAS\' MISSION: VATICAN </p><p>SEEKS TO AVOID POLARIZATION AND VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS.
