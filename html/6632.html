<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 002451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/AGS AND EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTHWEST GERMANY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL NEWS </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Summary: This is the first in a series of monthly </p><p>cables planned to summarize political and economic events in </p><p>ConGen Frankfurt\'s consular district.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Political News </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. New Hesse Cabinet: Corts and Gruettner on the Rise </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Roland Koch named the ministers of his new cabinet on </p><p>February 24.  The number of ministries inreased from nine to </p><p>ten by dividing portfolios previously under one minister. </p><p>Three of the ministers are new.  The Lord Mayor of Fulda </p><p>Alois Rhiel will be the new Economics Minister.  The very </p><p>popular local politician has an economic background and </p><p>belongs to the progressive wing of the CDU known for </p><p>creative ideas and reaching out to non-traditional partners </p><p>such as environmental groups.  His main issue will be </p><p>Frankfurt airport expansion, planned for 2006.  Minister of </p><p>Higher Education, Science and Culture, and Frankfurt CDU </p><p>chief Udo Corts replaces outgoing FDP chairwoman Ruth </p><p>Wagner.  Corts is seen as a potential successor to Minister- </p><p>President Koch.  Former CDU parliamentary manager Stefan </p><p>Gruetter represents the Hesse CDU\'s conservative wing. </p><p>Gruettner takes over the State Chancellery from Jochen </p><p>Riebel, and has the important task of coordinating Koch\'s </p><p>policies among the other ministries. </p><p> </p><p>3. Upcoming Visits to Washington by German Officials </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Hesse Minister-President Koch (CDU) plans a visit to </p><p>Washington D.C. May 13-15, and if his schedule permits, will </p><p>also travel to Hesse\'s partner State Wisconsin.  Koch has </p><p>requested Consulate assistance in setting up meetings.  He </p><p>plans to focus on international issues.  Koch is positioning </p><p>himself as a national CDU player in his ambition to be CDU </p><p>chancellor candidate in 2006.  Interestingly, he announced </p><p>his visit while Angela Merkel was in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>Baden- Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dr. Walter Doering </p><p>will also visit the U.S. this year.  We are gathering </p><p>details. </p><p> </p><p>4. Alexander von Stahl Joins Baden-Wuerttemberg FDP </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Alexander von Stahl, the former Federal Prosecutor, </p><p>who was released from office in 1993, has joined the B-W </p><p>FDP.  Von Stahl is a controversial figure.  He moved from </p><p>Berlin to Ettlingen, a small community south of Karlsruhe </p><p>and is now a member of the Ettlingen FDP chapter.  The </p><p>Chairman of the Ettlingen FDP is Rudolf Doering, the brother </p><p>of FDP State Chairman and Economics Minister Walter Doering. </p><p>Von Stahl has already established contact with Stefan Havlik </p><p>and Dietmar-Dominik Hennig, two members of the Ulm FDP who </p><p>made headlines last year by publicly supporting Juergen </p><p>Moellemann\'s criticism of Jewish leaders.  Von Stahl is also </p><p>in touch with Hans-Manfred Roth, the former ultra- </p><p>conservative chairman of the Bad Cannstatt FDP who caused a </p><p>stir by inviting Austria\'s  Joerg Haider to speak in </p><p>Stuttgart. </p><p> </p><p>5. Stuttgart Islamic Experts Group Concerned About Islamic </p><p>Fundamentalist Links to German Extremist Groups </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) The Stuttgart "Islamic Experts Group" of the Baden- </p><p>Wuerttemberg State Office for the Protection of the </p><p>Constitution, founded in 1997, has gained more importance </p><p>since 9/11.  The unit consists of 35 experts who are fluent </p><p>in several Arab languages, screen Internet pages, Arab </p><p>papers and Arab TV programs.  Landolin Mueller, chief of the </p><p>group, states that Internet messages are difficult to </p><p>interpret when dialects come into play.  Hidden messages </p><p>contain intense hatred against Israel and the U.S.  Hatred </p><p>and attacks against the U.S. are in most cases legitimized </p><p>with quotes from the Koran.  Mueller notes the number of </p><p>militant Islamic fundamentalists is increasing but </p><p>infiltration of fundamentalist circles is extremely </p><p>difficult.  Mueller is concerned about the Internet linkage </p><p>between different militant groups and the fact that these </p><p>circles seek loose ties with right and left wing extremist </p><p>groups in Germany.  Their hatred of the U.S. binds them. </p><p> </p><p>Economic News </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Paris Overtakes Frankfurt Airport in Number of </p><p>Passengers </p><p> </p><p>(U) Paris Charles de Gaulle overtook Frankfurt Airport in </p><p>2002 with the largest number of passengers in continental </p><p>Europe.  According to figures released by the Board of </p><p>Airlines in Germany (BARIG) on March 20, Paris had 48.4 </p><p>million passengers, while Frankfurt had 48.2 million. </p><p>Frankfurt is still Europe\'s number one cargo airport.  1.5 </p><p>billion tons of freight were transported through Frankfurt, </p><p>but Amsterdam and London-Heathrow are catching up.  The </p><p>announcement renewed calls by Frankfurt Airport Executives </p><p>for the speedy construction of a new runway at Frankfurt </p><p>Airport. </p><p>7. Regional Airports in Southwest Germany Losing Passengers </p><p> </p><p>(U) The Stuttgart Airport owns over 60 percent of the </p><p>regional Baden Airport in Soellingen (between Karlsruhe and </p><p>Baden-Baden), a former military airport.  In order to keep </p><p>the status of "regional airport," investments up to 200 </p><p>million Euro will be necessary.  Georg Fundel, Managing </p><p>Director of the Stuttgart Airport, is under pressure from </p><p>the B-W State Government to make such a financial commitment </p><p>despite declining passenger numbers at smaller regional </p><p>airports. During a meeting with Consul General, Fundel made </p><p>clear that he has no intentions to invest the 200 million </p><p>Euro and called the Soellingen airport "a stillborn child". </p><p>Given a choice, Fundel would rather close the airport than </p><p>invest the money.  In light of the current downturn in the </p><p>airline industry, all civilian airports in Baden- </p><p>Wuerttemberg are reporting lower numbers.  In 2002, the </p><p>Stuttgart airport, for example, lost 900,000 passengers, a </p><p>drop of 10 percent compared to the peak year of 2000. </p><p> </p><p>8. Saarland Has Low Unemployment, New Focus on Automotive </p><p>Sector </p><p> </p><p>(U) Saarland, the smallest German state, has the lowest </p><p>unemployment.  In 1999, Saarland was number eleven in </p><p>Germany, today it is number five with 9.9 percent. </p><p>Unemployment rose 4.7 percent in January compared with </p><p>December. (The national average was 10 percent.)  Saarland </p><p>also showed the biggest jump in growth in Germany with 1.2 </p><p>percent (Germany average: 0.2 percent).  The growth is </p><p>attributed to successful economic development initiatives </p><p>and a shift away from steel and coal towards automotive </p><p>supply industries. </p><p> </p><p>9.  German Customs Catch Tax Evaders at Swiss Border </p><p> </p><p>(U) In 2002, customs officers of the Singen customs office </p><p>have confiscated 1 billion Euro during random checks of </p><p>vehicles at the German-Swiss border.  According to German </p><p>customs officials Germans from all professions bring cash </p><p>over the 283-kilometer-long border to Switzerland to avoid </p><p>German taxes.  47 million travelers and 20 million cars pass </p><p>through the 24 border checkpoints each year.  The Stuttgart </p><p>IRS office alone was able to collect an additional 9.3 </p><p>million Euro in 2002 due to the findings of the customs </p><p>officials. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IBM Germany Has New CEO </p><p> </p><p>(U) Walter Raizner is the new CEO of IBM Germany.  He </p><p>succeeds Erwin Staudt who was appointed Chairman of the </p><p>Supervisory Board.  Raizner expects a difficult year for IBM </p><p>Germany, with IT markets shrinking by 1.7 percent. </p><p> </p><p>11. Zeiss Loses Money, Lays Off Workers </p><p> </p><p>(U) The Optics Company Carl Zeiss announced that it will </p><p>have to cut 200 jobs at its headquarters in Oberkochen, a </p><p>sharp decline from its 2002 growth, which created 500 new </p><p>jobs.  During the first four months of the new business year </p><p>(which started October 1, 2002), turnover dropped by nine </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>12. DaimlerChrysler\'s Profits Improve </p><p> </p><p>(U) DaimlerChrysler reported a 6.8 billion Euro operating </p><p>profit for the year 2002.  The Mercedes Car Group </p><p>contributed the largest growth, with an operating profit of </p><p>3.02 billion Euro and the Chrysler Group with 1.3 billion </p><p>Euro.  DaimlerChrysler\'s problem division is trucks and </p><p>vans, with a loss of 343 million Euro.  For the year 2003, </p><p>DaimlerChrysler CEO Juergen Schrempp is worried about </p><p>profits.  The global economic situation and international </p><p>tensions may have a negative impact on growth. </p><p>DaimlerChrysler is in 100 countries. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
