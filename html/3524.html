(SBU) Jordan\'s record on enforcement of IPR laws </p><p>has been improving steadily over the past six months. </p><p>However, greater awareness of the impact of lax IPR </p><p>enforcement on Jordanian industries as well as further </p><p>reform of existing IPR legislation and prosecution is </p><p>still needed if Jordan is to fulfill all of its </p><p>obligations under the WTO and the Jordan-U.S. FTA. </p><p>Courses like the proposed USPTO conference on </p><p>specialized IP courts help in this regard.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ENFORCEMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Director of the National Library (the </p><p>government entity charged with copyright registration </p><p>and IPR enforcement), Ma\'moun Talhouni, has been a </p><p>much more effective enforcer of Jordan\'s IPR </p><p>legislation than his predecessors.  Since his </p><p>appointment on July 22, 2001, the number of raids on </p><p>illegal audio-visual outlets has increased to more </p><p>than a thousand, and the number of cases brought by </p><p>the National Library to the district attorney between </p><p>July 23, 2001 and august, 2002 totaled 350 cases, with </p><p>about 125 of these in July.  This compares to 38 cases </p><p>filed between July 2000 and July 2001 and 6 cases the </p><p>year before.  If one such outlet gets raided twice in </p><p>a row and is found harboring pirated materials, then </p><p>in addition to the fine, licensees are invited to file </p><p>a civil suit against it.  Talhouni told us that a good </p><p>percentage of the patent/trademark/copyright </p><p>infringement cases referred to the courts for </p><p>prosecution receive sentences. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Talhouni told econchief he thought fines and </p><p>jail time could be harsher so as to be more effective </p><p>deterrents.  Still, the substantial increase in the </p><p>number of raids and the number of cases brought in </p><p>front of the courts has made life harder for vendors </p><p>of pirated goods.  As the hassle of being raided and </p><p>then going through the legal process bears fruit, some </p><p>shopkeepers are even starting to report the names of </p><p>other offenders with whom they compete. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In order to take stock of the quantity and </p><p>quality of these sentences, the National Library has </p><p>sent out a survey to the judges of the courts of first </p><p>instance.  The survey inquires about the number of IPR </p><p>cases, the percentage that receive sentences, their </p><p>quality and severity, and problems with each case. </p><p>The survey also aims to evaluate ways the National </p><p>Library can help improve its presentation of each case </p><p>and close any legal loopholes so that it can ensure </p><p>logical and deterrent sentences.  Since most raids are </p><p>still conducted without police support, some </p><p>irregularities take place and render the ensuing cases </p><p>vulnerable to legal questioning.  Better coordination </p><p>with the police department is needed in this respect. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) According to IPR watchers, however, many </p><p>National Library cases have failed in courts because </p><p>library officials did not follow proper law </p><p>enforcement procedures, and because with little </p><p>manpower (just six officers), National Library staff </p><p>have no time to testify in courts themselves.  Under </p><p>the law, the burden of the proof lies on the </p><p>prosecutor to prove intent.  Many defendants take </p><p>advantage of this by claiming ignorance of the law and </p><p>of any wrongdoing to escape prosecution.  Defense </p><p>attorneys are also using the latter and are becoming </p><p>better at finding loopholes in the law and in the </p><p>legal procedures used by the enforcement officials to </p><p>get their clients off the hook. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Furthermore, Talhouni complains that rights- </p><p>holders or other parties whose interests are harmed by </p><p>piracy are not being sufficiently active in protecting </p><p>their rights and in assisting the library. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In addition, the copyright law, despite being </p><p>TRIPS-consistent, still suffers from various loopholes </p><p>that need to be closed.  Finally, Jordan has yet to </p><p>ACCEDE to the WCT, the WPPT and some ARTICLES of the </p><p>Paris convention dealing with patent protection and </p><p>geographical indicators, though it has committed to do </p><p>so under the terms of the U.S.-Jordan FTA.  In an </p><p>important step forward, a local legal firm </p><p>specializing in IPR protection wrote a position paper, </p><p>for the private sector on their IPR needs.  The firm </p><p>offered its assistance to the group in lobbying the </p><p>GOJ to take more stringent IPR measures in advance of </p><p>the FTA joint commission meeting. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Operational hurdles </p><p>------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) With a staff of just six copyright enforcement </p><p>officers throughout Jordan, the National Library </p><p>remains clearly short on qualified manpower.  The </p><p>prime minister recently approved a special 30 percent </p><p>basic salary raise for the over-worked enforcement </p><p>staff in order to make salaries more competitive with </p><p>the private sector.  Still, library salaries are as </p><p>low as USD 150 per month.  USAID, through its AMIR </p><p>program has donated six computers to the National </p><p>Library.  However, the National Library remains in </p><p>acute need of new cars, digital cameras, photocopiers, </p><p>and facilities.  Its staff needs more training, new </p><p>pc\'s and software, mobile phones, English language </p><p>training, and incentives for working late and </p><p>irregular hours.  It also needs to develop a database </p><p>of licensees in order to contact them immediately to </p><p>sue when a case is referred to the courts.  Finally, </p><p>the role of the National Library and its positive </p><p>impact needs to be publicized and linked in the minds </p><p>of Jordanians to the potential impact on Jordan\'s </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Judiciary and IPR </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Whereas enforcement is making progress, the </p><p>judiciary remains the weak link.  Jordanian judges </p><p>need more education on and exposure to IPR in order to </p><p>effectively enforce the legislation in place.  With </p><p>the help of the judicial council, training courses for </p><p>judges on IPR and e-commerce are being conducted with </p><p>the support of the Jordanian bar association, and the </p><p>ministries of culture and industry and trade. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) According to Talhouni, judges need to be </p><p>quicker, more aware and understanding of IPR issues, </p><p>and harsher in their sentences.  Many of them, he </p><p>said, sympathize with the local shop owners and see no </p><p>reason to protect the rights of distant foreigners, </p><p>not realizing the long-term implications of this on </p><p>Jordan\'s own nascent intellectual life.  IPR-related </p><p>crimes are supposed to be fined anywhere between JD </p><p>1,000 - 3,000, which is too low by international </p><p>standards and could not be considered as a sufficient </p><p>deterrent.  Jordan committed to increase to JD 6,000 </p><p>under the Jordan-us FTA.  However, some judges </p><p>consider that too high and so give far more lenient </p><p>sentences.  The solution, said Talhouni, would be </p><p>awareness on how IPR infringement also hurts </p><p>Jordanians.  Testimony by Jordanian victims of piracy </p><p>could change the judges\' mindset and make it more </p><p>favorable towards IPR implementation. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The Library and Higher Judicial Council </p><p>have been working with local IP organizations and WIPO </p><p>to raise judicial awareness through seminars and other </p><p>activities.  The embassy\'s public affairs section has </p><p>also been active in promoting IP awareness, including </p><p>through a series of well-attended digital </p><p>videoconferences.  But much more work remains to be </p><p>done to bring the overworked judiciary up to speed. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) A related complication is the unwillingness </p><p>of victims of IPR infringement, whether the licensees </p><p>or the copyright holders (such as some Jordanian </p><p>writers in a recent case) to file a case against the </p><p>perpetrators for fear of losing business or for lack </p><p>of conviction.  Many of them would complain loudly </p><p>about their problems and issues whenever given the </p><p>chance, however, they would shy away from taking any </p><p>action themselves and would like the government or </p><p>even post to do their bidding for them.  This largely </p><p>stems from the generally non-confrontational nature of </p><p>people and business in Jordan. </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Jordan\'s record on IPR enforcement over the </p><p>past six months remains mixed.  Greater ENFORCEMENT </p><p>and more raids are taking place.  However, without </p><p>closing the loopholes in the IPR laws, changing the </p><p>mindset of the judiciary and convincing the victims of </p><p>IPR crimes to file their own civil suits, IPR </p><p>enforcement in Jordan will be hard-pressed to keep up </p><p>with Jordan\'s commitments under WTO and the Jordan- </p><p>U.S. FTA.  Allocating special IPR judges and training </p><p>them while changing the image of IPR crimes by </p><p>highlighting their negative effects on Jordanians </p><p>would be steps in the right direction.  Finally, </p><p>greater coordination between the National Library, the </p><p>police force and the customs department could help </p><p>making IPR cases a lot more difficult to dismiss. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) We noted with interest ref b announcement </p><p>of USPTO\'s planned conference on specialized IPR </p><p>courts.  This is just the sort of awareness-raising </p><p>Jordan\'s civil court judges need to help their </p><p>resources match their willingness to make progress on </p><p>strengthening IPR enforcement.  We are working with </p><p>Talhouni to identify two English speaking judges could </p><p>benefit from this conference.  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
