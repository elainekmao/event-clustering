CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA </p><p>SOLMAZ UNAYDIN GAVE POL COUNSELOR MARCH 27 ADDITIONAL </p><p>INSIGHTS INTO THE TURKISH-SYRIAN DIALOGUE ON THE PKK. </p><p>SHE SAID FOREIGN MINISTER ALPTEMOCIN HAD RAISED THE </p><p>SUBJECT EXPLICITLY WITH ASAD DURING HIS FEBRUARY VISIT </p><p>TO DAMASCUS.  ASAD REPORTEDLY TOLD ALPTEMOCIN SYRIA </p><p>WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT "IT WOULD TAKE </p><p>TIME."  UNAYDIN THOUGHT REPORTS THAT PKK LEADER OCALAN </p><p>HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST DURING FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SHARA\'S RECENT VISIT TO ANKARA WERE INDICATIVE </p><p>OF A SYRIAN EFFORT TO REIN IN THE PKK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NEVERTHELESS, SHE SAID IT IS CLEAR THAT DAMASCUS </p><p>CONTINUES TO LINK CONTROL OF THE PKK TO THE WATER </p><p>ISSUE.  SHARA HAD BROUGHT A WATER EXPERT WITH HIM ON </p><p>THIS LATEST TRIP TO EXPLORE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT </p><p>FOR TURKEY TO SHUT OF THE FLOW OF EUPHRATES WATER FOR </p><p>2-3 DAYS PER MONTH (THE LATEST CLOSURE WAS MARCH </p><p>24/25).  THE SYRIAN EXPERT TRAVELED TO THE ATATURK DAM </p><p>AFTER SHARA\'S DEPARTURE.  HE IS STILL THERE.  AS UNAYDIN </p><p>EXPLAINED IT, THE POND BEHIND THE DAM IS FILLING AT A </p><p>SLOWER THAN EXPECTED RATE AND TURKISH ENGINEERS FEAR </p><p>THERE IS LEAKAGE.  TO LOCATE THIS, THEY MUST CUT OFF ALL </p><p>EUPHRATES FLOW PERIODICALLY.  THUS FAR, ACCORDING TO </p><p>UNAYDIN, NO LEAK HAS BEEN FOUND. </p><p> </p><p>GROSSMAN </p><p></p></div>
