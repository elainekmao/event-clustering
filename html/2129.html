<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 GABORONE 003517 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PREL, PTER, BC </p><p>SUBJECT: BOTSWANA: TREASURY DEPARTMENT REQUEST FOR </p><p>INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 185882, (B) GABORONE 3458, (C) GABORONE </p><p>3343, (D) GABORONE 3456, (E) MORROW-HOFFMAN EMAIL 10-30- </p><p>2001 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE GOB HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>ITS FINANCIAL SYSTEM DOES NOT BECOME A HAVEN FOR ILLEGAL </p><p>FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER MONEY LAUNDERING, DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKING, OR TERRORIST FINANCING.  WHILE WE STILL HAVE </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT VARYING LEVELS OF IMPLEMENTATION BY THE </p><p>DIFFERENT AGENCIES INVOLVED, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE </p><p>MECHANISMS INVOLVED, BOTH THOSE PRE-EXISTING AND THOSE </p><p>UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY AND TO </p><p>BLOCK TERRORIST\' ACCESS TO FINANCING IN BOTSWANA.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>++++++++++ </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING CONSTITUTES OUR ANSWERS TO THE </p><p>QUESTIONS PRESENTED IN REF A.  AS FURTHER INFORMATION </p><p>DEVELOPS, WE WILL UPDATE THESE ANSWERS.  ALL DOCUMENTS </p><p>REFERRED TO BELOW ARE BEING SENT TO THE TREASURY </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S FOREIGN LAW UNI VIA EXPRESS COURIER (REF E). </p><p> </p><p>A.  THE GOB HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE OF GLOBAL </p><p>COALITION EFFORTS AGAINST TERRORISM, INCLUDING FINANCIAL </p><p>MEASURES.  THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF BOTSWANA (BOB) </p><p>BOTSWANA\'S CENTRAL BANK, ISSUED A LETTER OCTOBER 8 TO ALL </p><p>BANKS IN BOTSWANA OUTLINING EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224, </p><p>DIRECTING THAT CONSTITUENT BANKS HALT PAYMENT AND/OR </p><p>TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO OR FOR ACCOUNTS OF ANY PERSON LISTED </p><p>BY SUCH ORDER.  BOB DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>MOSES PELAELO ISSUED A FOLLOW-UP LETTER OCTOBER 17 WHICH </p><p>PROVIDED THE UPDATED LIST OF ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WHOSE ASSETS ARE TO BE BLOCKED. </p><p>RELEVANT TEXT OF THE LETTERS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>++++++++++ </p><p> </p><p>OCTOBER 8, 2001 </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS TO REMIND YOU THAT BOTSWANA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS.  THIS MEANS THAT ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>IN BOTSWANA, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE ALL </p><p>MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT UNWITTINGLY PROVIDE </p><p>SAFE HARBOR FOR TERRORIST ACTIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  THIS </p><p>FOLLOWS THE SIGNING OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH PROVIDES </p><p>FOR BLOCKING PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY OF </p><p>PERSONS WHO HAVE COMMITTED OR POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF </p><p>COMMITTING ACTS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE FIND ATTACHED HEREWITH THE PAPER ON THE US </p><p>EXECUTIVE ORDER AS WELL AS AN ANNEX DETAILING PERSONS </p><p>WHOSE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED, THUS </p><p>FAR, BY THE US GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDINGLY, WITH IMMEDIATE </p><p>EFFECT, NO PAYMENT AND/OR TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO, OR FOR </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF ANY PERSONS LISTED THEREIN ARE PERMITTED, </p><p>WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>BOTSWANA. </p><p> </p><p>++++++++++ </p><p> </p><p>OCTOBER 17, 2001 </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>FURTHER TO THE GOVERNOR\'S LETTER OF OCTOBER 8, 2001 ON </p><p>THE ABOVE, PLEASE FIND HEREWITH AN UPDATED LIST OF </p><p>ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHOSE FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE TO BE </p><p>BLOCKED. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT, NO PAYMENT AND/OR </p><p>TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO OR FOR ACCOUNT OF ANY PERSON LISTED </p><p>IN ANNEXURE I SHALL BE PERMITTED, WITHOUT THE PRIOR </p><p>APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA. </p><p> </p><p>++++++++++ </p><p> </p><p>B. BOB ADVISOR (AND FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF </p><p>CHICAGO EMPLOYEE) JOHN MONTGOMERY EXPLAINED TO US ON </p><p>OCTOBER 29 THAT THE LETTERS QUOTED ABOVE DO NOT RISE TO </p><p>THE LEVEL OF A FREEZE ORDER.  A FREEZE ORDER WOULD NEED </p><p>TO COME FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE OR FROM A </p><p>COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, DIRECTING ACTION AGAINST </p><p>A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT, ENTITY, PERSON, OR INSTITUTION, HE </p><p>SAID.  OUR PRESUMPTION IS THAT, SHOULD A FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTION REPORT TO THE BOB THE EXISTENCE OF SPECIFIC </p><p>ACCOUNTS, ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION WOULD FOLLOW, BUT THAT </p><p>PRESUMPTION HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. </p><p> </p><p>C.  THE GOB HAS THUS FAR BLOCKED NO ASSETS UNDER THIS </p><p>ORDER, NOR HAS ANY BANK THUS FAR REPORTED THE EXISTENCE </p><p>OF ACCOUNTS BEING HELD BY ANY OF THE ENTITIES MENTIONED </p><p>IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. </p><p> </p><p>D. </p><p> </p><p>(I)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, SUCH AS UNSCR 1267 OR 1373, </p><p>IS REQUIRED BEFORE ASSETS MAY BE FROZEN UNDER BOTSWANA </p><p>LAW.  THE ABOVE OCTOBER 8 AND OCTOBER 17 LETTERS NOTE </p><p>THAT BOTSWANA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS.  BOB </p><p>ISSUED THE LETTERS DIRECTING NO FURTHER TRANSFERS OR </p><p>PAYMENTS TO THE LISTED PERSONS OR ENTITIES UNDER THEIR </p><p>OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO THAT AUTHORITY.  FURTHER LEGAL </p><p>ACTION AGAINST THE ACCOUNTS OR THEIR HOLDERS WOULD BE THE </p><p>PURVIEW OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>(II)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN HOW UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL 1373 WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH </p><p>LISTS.  MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY MPOFU IS CHAIRING AN AD </p><p>HOC INTER-AGENCY COMMITTEE TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING UNSCR </p><p>1373.  (REF D).  THE BANK OF BOTSWANA HAS ALREADY </p><p>DIRECTED BOTSWANA BANKS NOT TO ACT ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD </p><p>BY PERSONS MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX TO E.O. 13324 AND ITS </p><p>UPDATE THROUGH THE LETTERS ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>(III)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A LIST </p><p>ADOPTED BY A MULTILATERAL BODY OTHER THAN THE UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL IS REQUIRED FOR SUCH FREEZING.  AS BOB ADVISOR </p><p>MONTGOMERY INDICATED, FREEZING ACCOUNTS IN BOTSWANA CAN </p><p>ONLY OCCUR PURSUANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR BY A </p><p>COURT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY, AND CAN ONLY BE DIRECTED AT </p><p>A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT.  (NOTE:  BOTSWANA IS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>FINANCIAL AFFAIRS TASK FORCE (FATF) OF COMMONWEALTH </p><p>COUNTRIES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE FATF WOULD HAVE </p><p>DIFFERENT AUTHORITY OR IMPOSE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAN </p><p>THOSE BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>(IV)  THE BANKING ACT OF 1995 DOES NOT EXPRESSLY MENTION </p><p>THE AUTHORITY TO FREEZE TERRORIST-RELATED OR TALIBAN- </p><p>RELATED ASSETS.  PURSUANT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS, THE BOB ISSUED THE LETTERS ABOVE DIRECTING </p><p>BANKS TO CEASE ACTION ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD BY PERSONS </p><p>MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. </p><p> </p><p>E.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE MFA THAT IMPLEMENTING </p><p>LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE MANDATORY UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS INTO BOTSWANA LAW. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCORPORATED </p><p>INTO BOTSWANA LAW; THEY ARE DEEMED RATIFIED ONLY UPON </p><p>SIGNATURE BY BOTSWANA\'S PRESIDENT.  AFTER RATIFICATION, </p><p>THEN THE MINISTRY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTION OVER THE TREATY </p><p>IN QUESTION, IN COORDINATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S </p><p>OFFICE, WILL IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO BOTSWANA LAW TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THE OBLIGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE TREATY IN </p><p>QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>F.  AS BOB\'S MONTGOMERY INDICATED, FREEZING ACCOUNTS IN </p><p>BOTSWANA CAN ONLY OCCUR PURSUANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p>ACTION OR BY A COURT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY, AND CAN ONLY </p><p>BE DIRECTED AT A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT.  PURSUANT TO ITS </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM CONVENTIONS, THE BOB ISSUED THE LETTERS ABOVE </p><p>DIRECTING BANKS TO CEASE ACTION ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD BY </p><p>PERSONS MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. </p><p> </p><p>G.  IF THE USG WERE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT/ACCOUNT </p><p>HOLDER/FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INFORMATION, IT APPEARS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE AG\'S OFFICE COULD ISSUE A FREEZE ORDER. </p><p>ABSENT THAT, THE GOB COULD BLOCK ALL TRANSACTIONS TO ANY </p><p>CATEGORY OF ACCOUNTS IMMEDIATELY, AND SUBSEQUENTLY MOVE </p><p>TO FREEZE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS ONCE IDENTIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>H.  BOB FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEPUTY DIRECTOR NCUBE ON </p><p>OCTOBER 29 GAVE US THREE DOCUMENTS WHICH THE GOB CREATED </p><p>PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11 TO AUGMENT ITS EFFORTS IN TRACKING </p><p>ILLEGAL FINANCIAL ACTIVITY: "DIRECTIVE BOB 3/2001: </p><p>GUIDELINES FOR AN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM"; AN </p><p>"EXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY" HANDOUT; AND A </p><p>"SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT" FORM FOR NOTICE AND COMMENT </p><p>TO BANKS IN BOTSWANA.  THESE DOCUMENTS, CURRENTLY BEING </p><p>CURCULATED TO BANKS IN BOTSWANA FOR COMMENT, WILL BE </p><p>INCORPORATED AS DIRECTIVES INTO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS IN </p><p>BOTSWANA TO REPORT MONEY-LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, AS PER </p><p>SECTION 21(4) OF THE BANKING ACT OF 1995.  BOB\'S TARGET </p><p>DATE FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE DIRECTIVES IS JANUARY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>(I)  WE BELIEVE THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOB OCTOBER 8 </p><p>AND OCTOBER 17 CONSTITUTE THEIR RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL </p><p>REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(II) BOB OFFICIALS REPORT NO TERRORIST ASSETS HAVE BEEN </p><p>LOCATED, AND THEREFORE NO FINANCING HAS BEEN FROZEN, </p><p>UNDER UNSCR 1267, 1333, OR 1373. </p><p> </p><p>I.  PLEASE SEE ANSWER TO H. ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>J.  ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE GOB HAS VOICED ITS </p><p>"UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT" IN OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p>(REF D).  PRESIDENT MOGAE GAVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HOW </p><p>BOTSWANA\'S LAWS ARE ALREADY DESIGNED TO THWART ILLEGAL </p><p>FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, INCLUDING TERRORIST FINANCING (REF </p><p>C).  FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE HAS ASSURED US THAT </p><p>BOTSWANA WILL BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF </p><p>UNSCR 1373 (REF C).  WE RECENTLY SENT A DIPLOMATIC NOTE </p><p>TO THE MFA NOTING THAT WE WOULD WELCOME ANY INFORMATION </p><p>IT CAN PROVIDE PRIOR TO THE REQUIRED 90-DAY REPORT TO THE </p><p>UN. </p><p> </p><p>K.  THE OCTOBER 17 LETTER QUOTED IN PARA (A) INCLUDED THE </p><p>COMPLETE USG LISTS OF 39 NAMES. </p><p> </p><p>L.  THE BOB OWES NO DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY TO ACCOUNT </p><p>HOLDERS.  SECTION 43(1) OF THE BANKING ACT OF 1995 </p><p>IMPOSES A DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY ON THE BANKS TO THEIR </p><p>ACCOUNT HOLDERS IN BOTSWANA, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN </p><p>EXCEPTIONS.  BANK OF BOTSWANA ACT SECTION 59, HOWEVER, </p><p>NOTES THAT "FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF </p><p>THIS ACT AND IN THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF ITS FUNCTIONS </p><p>UNDER THIS ACT, THE BANK MAY CALL FOR SUCH INFORMATION AS </p><p>IT MAY REQUIRE FROM ANY PERSON."  SECTION 60 STATES THAT </p><p>"THE BANK (OF BOTSWANA) SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY OF </p><p>THE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER </p><p>THE BANKING ACT. </p><p> </p><p>M.  COPIES OF ALL AVAILABLE LAWS AND THE LETTERS </p><p>MENTIONED ABOVE ARE BEING SENT VIA EXPRESS COURIER TO THE </p><p>TREASURY DEPARTMENT\'S FOREIGN LAW UNIT.  THE PACKAGE WILL </p><p>INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>  -- BANKING ACT OF 1995; </p><p> </p><p>  -- BANK OF BOTSWANA ACT OF 1996, INCLUDING ITS 1999 </p><p>     AMENDMENT; </p><p> </p><p>  -- BOTSWANA STOCK EXCHANGE ACT OF 1994; </p><p> </p><p>  -- COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT UNDERTAKINGS REGULATIONS, </p><p>     1998; </p><p> </p><p>  -- FINANCE AND AUDIT ACT OF 1994, INCLUDING ITS 1997 </p><p>     AMENDMENT; </p><p> </p><p>  -- LETTER FROM BANK OF BOTSWANA GOVERNOR LINAH K. </p><p>     MOHOHLO OF OCTOBER 8, 2001 TO BANKS AND BUREAUX </p><p>     DE CHANGES ON RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE </p><p>     INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>     THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM; AND </p><p> </p><p>  -- LETTER FROM BANK OF BOTSWANA FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>     DIRECTOR MOSES PELAELO OF OCTOBER 17, 2001 TO BANKS </p><p>     AND BUREAUX DE CHANGES ON UPDATED LIST OF ENTITIES </p><p>     AND INDIVIDUALS WHOSE FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE TO BE </p><p>     BLOCKED. </p><p> </p><p>N.
