<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002411 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A/S KANSTEINER MEETS NEXT GENERATION OF </p><p>NIGERIAN LEADERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  At a 25 dinner hosted by Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Assistant Secretary Kansteiner met with a group of </p><p>Nigeria\'s "best and brightest," young but influential </p><p>advisors in the Obasanjo Administration today, to discuss </p><p>Nigeria\'s economic and political challenges.  The </p><p>participants outlined the damage done by years of </p><p>destructive military rule and diverted oil revenue, which </p><p>eroded government institutions and decimated the civil </p><p>service.  Even considering the obstacles, this dynamic </p><p>group expressed confidence that a second Obasanjo term </p><p>could make inroads solving the country\'s problems through </p><p>increased privatization, economic reform, and an overhaul </p><p>of Nigeria\'s once highly professional civil service.  This </p><p>group of young, highly educated, articulate and deeply </p><p>committed professionals represent the next generation of </p><p>Nigerian leaders and give us hope about the future of </p><p>Nigeria.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Participants in the meeting were: Steve Oronsaye, </p><p>Principal Secretary for the President; Oby Ezekwesili, </p><p>Special Assistant on Political Affairs; Aliyu Moddibo Umar, </p><p>Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff; Magnus Kpakol, </p><p>Chief Economic Advisor; Nasir El-Rufai, Director of Bureau </p><p>of Public Enterprises; Pat Utomi, Director of the Lagos </p><p>Business School.  Ambassador Jeter, Consul General Hinson- </p><p>Jones, A/S Senior Advisor Jim Dunlap, PolCouns, the </p><p>Ambassador\'s Special Assistant and Econoff (notetaker) also </p><p>attended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Exchange Rate: A Sentimental Favorite </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  In today\'s Nigeria, all economic conversations start </p><p>with the recent depreciation of the naira. Ezekwesili, </p><p>stressed the need to educate the public on the benefits of </p><p>a market driven exchange rate, so that people would not </p><p>think the government had "abandoned them." El-Rufai </p><p>asserted that Nigerians have a sentimental attachment to a </p><p>high naira dollar exchange rate and often judged economic </p><p>performance based on the stability in that exchange. The </p><p>truth, participants agreed, was that an overvalued naira </p><p>had subsidized an already wealthy class of elite </p><p>businessmen, importers and consumers, leaving the domestic </p><p>manufacturing sector unable to compete on the world market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Institutional Capacity and Management of Resources </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Conversation then focused on Nigeria\'s lack of </p><p>institutional capacity and poor performance in managing </p><p>resources, topics that repeat like a broken record in any </p><p>conversation of the country\'s economic ills.  Ezekwesili </p><p>pointed out that when the system fails in the US, like with </p><p>Enron, people turn to the law for a remedy to fix the </p><p>"broken" institution. She complained that in Nigeria, </p><p>decades of colonialism, military rule and corruption fueled </p><p>by huge revenues from the sale of oil had eroded </p><p>traditional institutions that checked government excesses </p><p>and mismanagement. When the Ambassador asked if the Nigeria </p><p>would ever develop an institutional system of checks and </p><p>balances, the participants said yes, but the process would </p><p>take time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Participants also cited the gross mismanagement of </p><p>resources as a major contributor to economic stagnation. </p><p>For too long, a small number of people reaped huge benefits </p><p>from oil revenues, without having to engage in economically </p><p>productive activity.  One area most affected by a lack of </p><p>resources was the civil service.  In the early days of the </p><p>Republic, civil servants received adequate and regular pay; </p><p>moreover, they joined the government out of a deep sense of </p><p>patriotism and national commitment.  This situation has </p><p>changed dramatically.  Years of poorly paid government </p><p>employees has created a diminished and lethargic, atavistic </p><p>bureaucracy, prone to corruption.  Now, Rufai said, the </p><p>Bureau of Public Enterprises (the agency responsible for </p><p>privatizing public companies) said he must pay 3 times the </p><p>salary of the private sector to lure qualified individuals. </p><p>High salaries have paid off, he said, by creating a highly </p><p>motivated and competent work force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Nigeria\'s Future: What Will Obasanjo Do Next? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Considering all the problems mentioned, the Ambassador </p><p>wondered what Obasanjo\'s first year in office would look </p><p>like, if he were re-elected.  One participant quickly </p><p>replied that he would be a true statesman and would push </p><p>for real economic reform.  El-Rufai commented that </p><p>privatization would continue at a determined pace. </p><p>Ezekwesili promised civil service reform would be a </p><p>priority, hoping the government could create a team of </p><p>"brain boxers", or a competent bureaucratic corps through </p><p>higher wages and merit based employment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment:  Listening to this influential and intelligent </p><p>group of dedicated civil servants and professionals, one </p><p>wonders why the Nigerian economy is still in crisis.  The </p><p>existence of such a group within the government and their </p><p>efforts to reform the system gives hope for progress. </p><p>Several USAID programs have attempted to tap into this </p><p>commitment, including assistance to the Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprises (BPE), the Vice President\'s Economic Policy </p><p>Coordinating Committee(EPCC), and the Debt Management </p><p>Office in the Ministry of Finance.  Still, many in Nigeria </p><p>do not share this commitment to reform and Obasanjo will </p><p>face steep opposition, even if given the luxury of a second </p><p>term.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
