(CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BANGLADESH HOPES THAT RAJIV GANDHI WOULD </p><p>BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>HAVE FADED OVER THE PAST YEAR.  BANGLADESH AND INDIA </p><p>HAVE MADE LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS ON LONG-STANDING </p><p>PROBLEMS UNDER RAJIV; MANY AGAIN APPEAR INTRACTABLE </p><p>AND NEW PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN.  THE UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE </p><p>IN THE CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS HAS BEEN A PARTICULARLY </p><p>IMPORTANT SETBACK.  WHILE THE USG HAS NO INTEREST IN </p><p>GETTING INVOLVED IN BANGLADESH-INDIA PROBLEMS AND SHOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO AVOID ANY POSITIONS ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES, </p><p>THE IMPROVEMENT OF BILATERAL RELATIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL </p><p>IN PROMOTING REGIONAL STABILITY, A LONG-TIME U.S. </p><p>OBJECTIVE IN SOUTH ASIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT PERCEPTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  BANGLADESHI HOPES THAT INDIAN PRIME MINISTER RAJIV </p><p>GANDHI WOULD BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IMPROVING RELATIONS </p><p>HAVE FADED OVER THE PAST YEAR. THERE IS A GROWING REAL- </p><p>IZATION THAT RAJIV FACES A MYRIAD OF DOMESTIC PROBLEMS, </p><p>AS WELL AS DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND SRI </p><p>LANKA, AND CAN DEVOTE LITTLE TIME TO BANGLADESH.  IN </p><p>THE BDG VIEW, WHAT GOODWILL OR NOBLE INTENTIONS HE MAY </p><p>HAVE TOWARDS IMPROVING RELATIONS HAVE BEEN STYMIED AT </p><p>EVERY TURN BY THE INDIAN BUREAUCRACY AND BY LESS HELP- </p><p>FUL POLITICAL FIGURES.  (WATER RESOURCES MINISTER </p><p>B. SHANKARANAND REMAINS A FAVORITE BDG BLACK HAT.) </p><p>MANY BANGLADESHIS CONSIDER THAT THE INDIAN FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY BUREAUCRACY IS DOMINATED BY PEOPLE WITH AN </p><p>IMPERIOUS  ATTITUDE TOWARDS INDIA\'S NEIGHBORS.  THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT WHILE ERSHAD AND RAJIV MAY PERSONALLY GET </p><p>ALONG WELL AND WANT TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES, </p><p>INDIAN BUREAUCRATS ARE DETERMINED TO KEEP UP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON BANGLADESH.  REPORTS THAT RAJIV CANNOT </p><p>MANAGE THESE BUREAUCRATS, AND GROWING PERCEPTIONS </p><p>THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S POLITICAL POSITION IS </p><p>WEAKENING, ONLY COMPOUND THE FEAR AMONG MANY IN </p><p>BANGLADESH THAT RAJIV IS POWERLESS TO EFFECT CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>4.  PRESIDENT ERSHAD\'S STATE VISIT TO DELHI JULY 14-16, </p><p>1986  LED TO AN OPEN AND POSITIVE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS, </p><p>BUT MANY IN BANGLADESH VIEWED IT AS A TEST OF RAJIV\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO HASTEN THE RESOLUTION OF BILATERAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>IN PARTICULAR THE TIN BIGHA LAND CASE AND THE EASTERN </p><p>WATERS PROBLEM.  BY JANUARY 1987, OPTIMISM THAT PROGRESS </p><p>COULD BE MADE ON BILATERAL ISSUES HAD FADED.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER TIWARI FACED A LITANY OF BDG GRIEVANCES DURING </p><p>HIS JANUARY 6-8 VISIT TO DHAKA.  BANGLADESH AND INDIA </p><p>HAVE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS ON LONG-STANDING PROBLEMS </p><p>UNDER RAJIV; MANY AGAIN APPEAR INTRACTABLE AND NEW </p><p>PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN.  FOREIGN MINISTER CHOUDHURY, IN A </p><p>MARCH 25 SPEECH BEFORE PARLIAMENT, DEVOTED NEARLY HALF </p><p>OF HIS HOUR-LONG ADDRESS TO INDO-BANGLADESHI BILATERAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  CHOUDHURY\'S FOCUS ON INDIA REFLECTED THE BDG </p><p>INTEREST IN DEMONSTRATING THE CORRECTNESS OF A STRONG </p><p>STAND ON BILATERAL ISSUES AT A TIME WHEN THE BDG IS </p><p>BECOMING INCREASINGLY EMBARRASSED AND FRUSTRATED BY </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FOLLOWING BILATERAL ISSUES, THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED EXTENSIVELY FROM DHAKA, FOR </p><p>THE MOST PART ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BESET </p><p>BANGLADESH-INDIA RELATIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND </p><p>DIMINISHED HOPES THAT RELATIONS WOULD IMPROVE UNDER </p><p>RAJIV.  LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN RECORDED ON LONG- </p><p>STANDING POLITICAL ISSUES.  AND IN ONE INSTANCE, THE </p><p>CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS, THE UPSURGE OF VIOLENCE THERE </p><p>HAS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  EASTERN WATERS.   ALTHOUGH THE BDG WAS PLEASED </p><p>THAT INDIA AGREED TO A TRILATERAL APPROACH TO AUGMENTING </p><p>THE FLOW OF GANGES RIVER WATER TO BANGLADESH, SENIOR BDG </p><p>OFFICIALS RECOGNIZED THAT ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>EASTERN WATERS ISSUE BY BUILDING A SERIES OF DAMS IN </p><p>NEPAL WAS CERTAIN TO BE FRUITLESS.  IN A "SHARING" </p><p>APPROACH, BANGLADESH IS NOW ASKING INDIA FOR A GUARAN- </p><p>TEED FLOW OF 25,000 CUSECS FROM THE GANGES, LESS THAN </p><p>THAT PROVIDED IN THE SHORT-TERM AGREEMENT NOW IN FORCE, </p><p>BUT ABOUT EQUAL TO WHAT BANGLADESH RECEIVES IN THE </p><p>LOWEST WATER MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN-SHARING </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THAT AGREEMENT.  BANGLADESH ALSO WANTS A </p><p>GUARANTEED 75 PERCENT OF THE FLOW OF THE BRAHMAPUTRA </p><p>AND 50 PERCENT OF THE FLOW OF THE OTHER BORDER RIVERS. </p><p>IF INDIA AGREES TO GUARANTEE THESE QUANTITIES OF WATER </p><p>FOR BANGLADESH, THE BANGLADESH IRRIGATION MINISTER </p><p>CLAIMS THE BDG WILL DROP ITS PROPOSAL FOR STORAGE DAMS </p><p>IN NEPAL AND INDIA COULD THEN ABANDON THE IDEA OF A </p><p>LINK CANAL FROM THE BRAHMAPUTRA TO THE GANGES ACROSS </p><p>BANGLADESH.  THE BDG BELIEVES THAT SUCH A SHARING </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH INDIA IS POSSIBLE, BUT THE INDIAN </p><p>BUREAUCRACY REMAINS OBSTRUCTIVE.  IN BANGLADESH </p><p>POLITICS, THE GREAT DANGER IS BEING SEEN AS "PRO- </p><p>INDIAN."  THUS, PRESIDENT ERSHAD IS CAUTIOUS IN DEALING </p><p>WITH THE EASTERN WATERS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>7.  CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS.   BDG OFFICIALS CLAIM </p><p>THAT INDIA HAS PROVIDED ARMS, REFUGE, AND FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE SHANTI BAHINI INSURGENTS IN THE </p><p>CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS, THUS FUELING AN INSURGENCY </p><p>WHICH HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY VIOLENT.  INDIA, ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, CLAIMS THAT BANGLADESH HAS GIVEN </p><p>REFUGE TO MEMBERS OF AN INDIAN INSURGENT GROUP, THE </p><p>TRIPURA NATIONAL VOLUNTEERS.  INDIA AND BANGLADESH </p><p>RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT BANGLADESH WOULD </p><p>REPATRIATE OVER 24,000 CHAKMA REFUGEES WHO FLED FROM </p><p>BANGLADESH IN THE WAKE OF SHANTI BAHINI VIOLENCE. </p><p>THE REPATRIATION PROGRAM WAS TO HAVE BEGUN ON </p><p>JANUARY 15, BUT SHANTI BAHINI ATTACKS STOPPED THE </p><p>REPATRIATION BEFORE IT BEGAN.  INDIA AND BANGLADESH </p><p>CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE CHARGES ABOUT WHICH COUNTRY IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.  FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>(#)UMAYUN RASHID CHOUDHURY IN A MARCH 25 SPEECH BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT SAID THAT BANGLADESH IS READY TO TAKE </p><p>BACK THE REFUGEES, BUT THAT THE GOI HAS NOT RESPONDED </p><p>TO BANGLADESH\'S PROPOSAL TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN </p><p>HOME SECRETARIES ON THE REPATRIATION PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS ISSUE IS A PARTICULARLY SENSI- </p><p>TIVE ONE FOR BANGLADESH IN VIEW OF A SEPTEMBER 1986 </p><p>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT CHARGING WIDESPREAD </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE HILL TRACTS BY BANGLADESH </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>8.  TIN BIGHA.   THE CALCUTTA HIGH COURT RULED IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1986 THAT THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION MUST </p><p>BE AMENDED BEFORE INDIA COULD LEASE THE TIN BIGHA </p><p>CORRIDOR  TO BANGLADESH IN PERPETUITY.  THE BANGLA- </p><p>DESHIS HAD ASKED FOR THE TERRITORY TO BE TURNED OVER </p><p>TO THEM DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1987.  RAJIV </p><p>PROMISED TO DELIVER QUICKLY ON TIN BIGHA, AND HAS </p><p>THUS FAR FAILED TO KEEP THAT PROMISE.  THE BDG </p><p>CLAIMS THE ISSUE IS A TEST OF INDIA\'S SINCERITY IN </p><p>IMPROVING RELATIONS OVERALL, BUT IN FACT APPEARS </p><p>FAIRLY RELAXED ABOUT INDIA\'S SLOWNESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>9.  MARITIME BOUNDARY.   FOREIGN MINISTER CHOUDHURY </p><p>IN HIS MARCH 25 SPEECH HAS SAID THAT, ACCORDING TO ALL </p><p>AVAILABLE INFORMATION, SOUTH TALPATTY ISLAND BELONGS </p><p>TO BANGLADESH.  INDIA, HOWEVER, HAS STAKED A CLAIM TO </p><p>THE ISLAND.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER NOTED THAT THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED TO DETERMINE OWNERSHIP THROUGH </p><p>A JOINT SURVEY. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>10.  IN THE MIDST OF THESE CONTENTIOUS BILATERAL </p><p>ISSUES, SOME BRIGHT SPOTS EXIST.  FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>11.  TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE.   BANGLADESH\'S </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD AND TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE </p><p>IN 1986  PASSED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO BANGLADESH-INDIA </p><p>RELATIONS.  INDO-BANGLADESHI RELATIONS WERE NEVER </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE PARLIAMENTARY OR </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.  WHILE THE INDIANS </p><p>MAY HAVE WANTED THE AWAMI LEAGUE TO EMERGE IN A </p><p>STRONG POSITION IN PARLIAMENT, NEITHER EVIDENCE NOR </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OF INDIAN INVOLVEMENT EXIST.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD OF THE LIFTING OF MARTIAL LAW </p><p>AND THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT ERSHAD, THERE WERE NO </p><p>SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS OF EITHER INDIAN INTERVENTION IN </p><p>BANGLADESH\'S AFFAIRS OR PRO-INDIAN SENTIMENT ON THE </p><p>PART OF BDG OFFICIALS.  AWAMI LEAGUE LEADER SHEIKH </p><p>HASINA\'S MEETING WITH RAJIV GANDHI IN NOVEMBER 1986 </p><p>CREATED A BRIEF FLURRY IN DHAKA, BUT APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>HAD NO LASTING IMPACT ON THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SCENE. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>12.  SAARC.   ALTHOUGH THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION </p><p>FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC) HAS YET TO HAVE A </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE ROLE IN THE REGION, INDIA HAS COOPERATED </p><p>WITH ITS NEIGHBORS TO ESTABLISH SAARC.  RAJIV\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR ERSHAD\'S PERSONAL ROLE IN SAARC\'S ESTAB- </p><p>LISHMENT, AND THEIR USE OF THE FORUM SAARC PROVIDED </p><p>FOR THE DISCUSSION OF BILATERAL ISSUES, HAVE BEEN </p><p>POSITIVE FACTORS IN BANGLADESH-INDIA RELATIONS DURING </p><p>THE PAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>13.  ASSAM BORDER.   THE ASSAM INFILTRATION ISSUE </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE SUBSIDED, AND THE INDIANS SEEM TO </p><p>HAVE DROPPED PLANS TO CONSTRUCT THEIR PROVOCATIVE </p><p>BORDER FENCE AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE HERE.  BUT LIKE </p><p>MANY  OTHER PROBLEMS IN INDO-BANGLADESH RELATIONS, </p><p>THE ISSUE  OF ALLEGED BANGLADESHI INFILTRATION INTO </p><p>LESS HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS OF NORTHEASTERN INDIA </p><p>REMAINS ONE WHICH CAN SUDDENLY BE BROUGHT AGAIN TO </p><p>PROMINENCE EITHER BY A STRAY EVENT OR AS A CONSEQUENCE </p><p>OF PERCEIVED DOMESTIC POLITICAL NEEDS IN THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  TRADE.   BANGLADESH\'S FRUSTRATIONS OVER THE </p><p>GROWING TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA AND INDIA\'S </p><p>NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO THE BDG REQUEST FOR IMPORT </p><p>FINANCING HAVE HEIGHTENED BANGLADESH\'S DISAPPOINT- </p><p>MENT AND PUBLIC SKEPTICISM ABOUT INDIAN INTENTIONS. </p><p>BANGLADESH-INDIA ECONOMIC TALKS ON DECEMBER 1-2, </p><p>1986 FOCUSED PRINCIPALLY ON THE TRADE IMBALANCE, </p><p>WHICH GREW TO 57 MILLION DOLLARS IN FY 1985.  IN </p><p>THAT YEAR, BANGLADESHI EXPORTS WERE UNUSUALLY STRONG, </p><p>BUT SUCCEEDED IN COVERING ONLY 39 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>IMPORTS FROM INDIA.  BANGLADESHIS VOICED DISAPPOINT- </p><p>MENT AT THE LACK OF CONCRETE DECISIONS COMING FROM </p><p>THE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS.  PROTESTS SURROUNDING THE </p><p>OPENING OF AN INDIAN TRADE EXHIBITION IN DHAKA IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1986 REFLECTED THE UNDERLYING TENSION IN </p><p>BANGLADESH\'S COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND THE </p><p>SENSITIVITY OF THIS ISSUE IN SOME POLITICAL QUARTERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>15.  ACCESS.   INDIAN REQUESTS FOR ACCESS THROUGH </p><p>BANGLADESH TERRITORY HAVE MET WITH RESISTANCE FROM </p><p>BDG AUTHORITIES.  ACCESS TO ASSAM VIA INLAND WATER </p><p>TRANSPORT, RAIL, AND ROAD, AND ACCESS TO THE SEA </p><p>(THROUGH CHITTAGONG) FOR MIZORAM HAVE BECOME CONTEN- </p><p>TIOUS BILATERAL ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS, THE </p><p>BANGLADESH MILITARY FEAR BOTH THE SECURITY ASPECTS </p><p>OF SUCH ACCESS AND THE "SMUGGLING" WHICH WOULD TAKE </p><p>PLACE.  BANGLADESH BELIEVES THERE WOULD BE A TREMEN- </p><p>DOUS, UNCONTROLLABLE LEAKAGE OF INDIAN GOODS INTO </p><p>BANGLADESH FROM RAILWAY AND ROAD TRANSIT.  THE </p><p>DIRECTOR ADDED THAT INDIA HAS THREATENED TO BUILD A </p><p>ROAD THROUGH THE NARROW NECK OF LAND WHICH CONNECTS </p><p>ASSAM TO THE REST OF INDIA.  THAT WOULD "CUT BANGLADESH </p><p>OUT" OF THE "BENEFITS" (TAXING POWER, FOR EXAMPLE) </p><p>WHICH WOULD COME FROM ALLOWING INDIA ACCESS TO ASSAM </p><p>THROUGH BANGLADESH TERRITORY.  (THE DIRECTOR, HOWEVER, </p><p>THINKS THE THREAT IS A BLUFF; THE ROAD WILL NEVER BE </p><p>BUILT BECAUSE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE.) MORE POSITIVELY, </p><p>INDIA AND BANGLADESH AGREED TO IMPROVE LAND LINE </p><p>TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATIONS TO PERMIT AUTOMATIC DIRECT </p><p>DIALING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THE SERVICE TOOK </p><p>EFFECT ON MARCH 26. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>16.  SMUGGLING.  LONG A PROBLEM BETWEEN INDIA AND </p><p>BANGLADESH, SMUGGLING APPEARS TO HAVE INCREASED </p><p>DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>RELIABLE STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE.  THIS FURTHER </p><p>STRAINS ECONOMIC RELATIONS.  THE BDG HAS FORMED AN </p><p>ANTI-SMUGGLING COMMITTEE, IN WHICH ERSHAD TAKES </p><p>A PERSONAL INTEREST, TO CRACK DOWN ON ALL SMUGGLING, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE POROUS INDIA-BANGLADESH BORDER. </p><p>ON MARCH 23, 1987  THE PARLIAMENT PASSED AN AMENDMENT </p><p>TO THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT ALLOWING THE DEATH PENALTY </p><p>TO BE IMPOSED AGAINST SMUGGLERS.  THE PRESIDENT IS </p><p>LIKELY TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION LATER THIS YEAR.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL SMUGGLED ITEMS SUCH AS COTTON </p><p>TEXTILES, BANGLADESH OFFICIALS BELIEVE HEROIN AND OTHER </p><p>ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE FINDING THEIR WAY INTO BANGLADESH </p><p>FROM INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE USG HAS NO INTEREST IN GETTING INVOLVED IN </p><p>BANGLADESH-INDIA PROBLEMS AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>AVOID ANY POSITIONS ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IMPROVEMENT OF BANGLADESH- </p><p>INDIA RELATIONS WILL PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY, A </p><p>LONG-TIME U.S. OBJECTIVE IN SOUTH ASIA.  OUR ROLE MUST </p><p>BE TO ENCOURAGE EACH SIDE, IN A LOW-KEY WAY, TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OTHER TO RESOLVE THE BILATERAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  AND ALL MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO QUICK, </p><p>EASY SOLUTION TO ANY OF THEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHAFFER </p><p></p></div>
