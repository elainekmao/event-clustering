<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: APPROVAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS APPEARS TO </p><p>OPEN WAY TO PRIME MINISTERSHIP FOR AK CHAIRMAN ERDOGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 ANKARA 9183 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) President Sezer\'s Dec. 31 approval of a package of </p><p>constitutional reforms appears to open the door for Justice </p><p>and Development (AK) Party leader Erdogan to regain his </p><p>political rights, run for Parliament, and become Prime </p><p>Minister.  A political reform package of legal amendments </p><p>(the second of the AK government\'s reform packages), designed </p><p>among other things to clear Erdogan\'s criminal record, awaits </p><p>Parliament\'s endorsement this week.  Erdogan has said he will </p><p>decide within days whether to apply to participate in the </p><p>re-run of the general election in Siirt province.  The Siirt </p><p>election is currently scheduled for Feb. 9.  However, Supreme </p><p>Election Board (YSK) chairman Algan declared publicly January </p><p>2 that March or April would be more appropriate "owing to </p><p>weather conditions" and in order to bring the election law </p><p>into conformity with the new constitutional amendments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) At the same time powerful elements of the State -- </p><p>including the judiciary, security services, and some in the </p><p>Turkish General Staff -- continue to share Sezer\'s wariness </p><p>toward Erdogan.  These elements still have the means to </p><p>attempt to hobble Erdogan and to promote and exploit intra-AK </p><p>frictions.  Specifically, legal hurdles remain with which </p><p>Erdogan must contend, including ongoing corruption trials </p><p>linked to Erdogan\'s 1994-98 tenure as Mayor of Istanbul.  In </p><p>addition, the closure case against AK continues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: run-up to the Siirt election will occur in </p><p>the context of a sharpened international and domestic Turkish </p><p>debate on Iraq.  Given Erdogan\'s insistence on controlling </p><p>the current AK government\'s decisions from party </p><p>headquarters, his propensity to play to popular feelings, and </p><p>his desire not to be handed any fait accompli, we expect GOT </p><p>decision-making to be further encumbered in January and </p><p>February. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
