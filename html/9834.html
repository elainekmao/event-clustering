<p>S E C R E T RANGOON 000919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, BM, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON AUNG SAN SUU KYI\'S LOCATION; VISITS TO </p><p>HOMES OF OTHER NLD LEADERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ron McMullen for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) NLD insiders tell us Aung San Suu Kyi has recently </p><p>been held in the house of a military officer on the complex </p><p>of a counter-terrorism unit in Hlegu Township, a few miles </p><p>north of Rangoon\'s international airport.  We do not know if </p><p>she is there permanently or was moved temporarily (from the </p><p>Clear Water Pond facility or elsewhere) to facilitate the </p><p>ICRC visit.  We hope to get a readout from the ICRC head of </p><p>delegation August 4th on his recent meeting with ASSK.  A </p><p>visiting academic with good links to the SPDC has asked to </p><p>see her, but so far has received no reply. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On July 30 emboffs drove to the Rangoon homes of </p><p>eight senior NLD leaders who are being held under house </p><p>arrest.  In most instances the homes were guarded by one </p><p>policeman and a municipal ward representative (typically an </p><p>unemployed young man paid "tea money" by MI to restrict </p><p>access to the house).  In some cases the police permitted us </p><p>to deliver packets of "American News and Views" right to the </p><p>houses, but more often they took the packets with a promise </p><p>to deliver them once the contents were cleared by their </p><p>superiors.  We know that as of August 1 NLD Chairman U Aung </p><p>Shwe has not received the packet we delivered. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We understand that this rather lax house arrest </p><p>system has enabled NLD activists to occasionally sneak into </p><p>the homes of the party leadership to pass news and receive </p><p>instructions.  We will continue our rather high-profile </p><p>regular visits, whether or not we are successful in getting </p><p>printed material to the detainees, to remind the SPDC and the </p><p>detained NLD leaders that we remain concerned about their </p><p>plight. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
