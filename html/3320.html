<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003916 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN YOUTH UNCONVINCED ABOUT THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM; FEARFUL THAT THEY COULD BE ITS NEXT TARGET </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Amman 3330 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The following cable is a report prepared by a foreign </p><p>service national and based on extensive contacts in the </p><p>student community. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Through the eyes of most Jordanian young adults, </p><p>America\'s war on terrorism is a war on Islam and the Arabs. </p><p>America\'s support for Israeli "oppression" of Palestinians - </p><p>which they see as getting worse, not better since September </p><p>11 -- is the main reason for this belief. A 20-year-old male </p><p>sums it up: "Palestinians have suffered brutal oppression </p><p>for the past 50 years under the Israelis. It is with </p><p>American support and with American weaponry that Israel is </p><p>able to do so." There is little popular support for current </p><p>US foreign policy among Jordan\'s youth. This was evident </p><p>when students burned American flags alongside the Israeli </p><p>flag during the April demonstrations in a show of angry </p><p>protest at America\'s "biased war." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Silenced politicized majority </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. POLFSN spoke recently with several dozen Jordanian </p><p>students. Despite a broad sense of apathy and helplessness, </p><p>these young adults were highly opinionated and politicized. </p><p>Almost every youth interviewed talked about his/her </p><p>inability to do anything about the "situation". Beyond </p><p>calling for the destruction of Israel, burning flags, and </p><p>boycotting American/Israeli goods, Jordanians feel powerless </p><p>in the face of a campaign of such magnitude (i.e. the war on </p><p>terrorism). "We are forbidden to talk politics, we are weak, </p><p>we can\'t allow political movements, demonstrations....". The </p><p>war on terrorism has highlighted their frustration with </p><p>their own government as demonstrations and public speeches </p><p>have been curtailed during moments of tension. </p><p> </p><p>4. There is a widespread perception among young adults that </p><p>the Security Services are all too often willing to </p><p>circumscribe freedom of expression in their effort to ensure </p><p>stability. A Professor at the University of Jordan claims </p><p>that students are "forbidden to talk or discuss terrorism </p><p>because that would mean talking about Islamism and </p><p>fundamentalism. Public talks are forbidden to delve into </p><p>these themes - rather, they must speak in general, and not </p><p>mention names, organizations, or the USA." They talk in </p><p>symbols or in the privacy of their own homes, with people or </p><p>professors they trust. When the Professor asks his students </p><p>political questions in class, the answers are usually muted. </p><p>"There is heavy GID presence in the classrooms and so </p><p>students are afraid to voice their opinion, but they come to </p><p>me in private, and they grasp ideas and they are vocal about </p><p>their anger at American foreign policy." </p><p> </p><p>5. One common denominator in the feelings of young adults in </p><p>Jordan is their opposition to America\'s war on terrorism. </p><p>"It\'s not a fair war, they (USG) are taking sides, they are </p><p>trying to be judges of the world, they give themselves the </p><p>right to decide who is a terrorist and who is not - and it\'s </p><p>not that simple", said one young adult. While many still do </p><p>not believe for certain that Bin Laden was responsible for </p><p>September 11, the majority is convinced of one thing: </p><p>America is biased and America doesn\'t like the Muslim Arab </p><p>world. This belief is entrenched, dangerously so, in the </p><p>minds of many. When asked about what message they would like </p><p>to send to the USG, the responses strike the same chord: "no </p><p>one likes terrorism, but think before you act against people </p><p>- and stop using September 11th in misguided ways." There is </p><p>a perception that anyone who has an Arab name, and has a </p><p>beard is automatically suspect. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Just how entrenched? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The following incident is worth mentioning as it sheds </p><p>light on Anti-American (foreign policy) sentiment in youth </p><p>circles. In mid-May, 5 professors were expelled from the </p><p>Shariaa (religious) school of the University of Jordan </p><p>(Reftel). Students with whom we spoke blame the USG for this </p><p>outcome. Their rational is this: All the professors were </p><p>graduates from Saudi Arabia, they were all appointed by the </p><p>Jordanian government, never talked badly about Jordan or the </p><p>King, and never received illegal foreign funding. "What </p><p>could be the reason behind their expulsion if it weren\'t for </p><p>America\'s campaign and crackdown on fundamentalism?" They </p><p>conclude that because the professors were Saudi graduates, </p><p>then the names of the professors must have come from America </p><p>to the Jordanian government, and that is the reason behind </p><p>their expulsion. </p><p> </p><p>7. Following the expulsion of the Professors, the University </p><p>took harsh disciplinary action against three students - all </p><p>from the Islamic movement in the University. Many students </p><p>are fearful that the University may impose additional </p><p>measures; student sources say that there possibly are twenty </p><p>facing similar disciplinary action.  Two strikes were held </p><p>in mid June, prompting the head of the Islamic Action Front </p><p>to send a letter to the Prime Minster with regard to the </p><p>perceived crackdown on students with an Islamic background. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Education not Punishment </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. A University of Jordan Professor of Sociology offered the </p><p>following analysis and advice on how best to address the </p><p>psycho-sociological reality of Jordan\'s youth: "Terrorism </p><p>and violence are rooted in people\'s lives, understandings, </p><p>and desperation. The war on terrorism should be geared to </p><p>education. It is important to uproot the causes of violence, </p><p>but if you want to fight the fighter, you will generate more </p><p>strife." He advocated a more tolerant view to "dry the </p><p>sources of discrimination and instead create more dialogue". </p><p>Although the Professor did not see this as a war on Islam </p><p>and the Arabs, he believes that many students view it as </p><p>such because it is Arab Muslim countries that the US appears </p><p>to be targeting. </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment: The main concern among many young Jordanians is </p><p>that the tactics America is employing in its war on </p><p>terrorism will, in the long run, only serve to intensify </p><p>Arab feelings of being identified as the enemy - and that </p><p>this is already having repercussions in the Middle East. </p><p>Such a dynamic - many educated Jordanians note ironically - </p><p>will only act to undermine support for the U.S. in Arab and </p><p>Muslim countries -- support that is necessary for the US\'s </p><p>war on terrorism to succeed. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
