Recalling earlier discussions (refs B-E), </p><p>Abdullah Rashed replied that the UAEG had not taken </p><p>control of the Iraqi mission in the UAE as it had </p><p>taken over supervision of the Rafidain Bank.  Noting </p><p>that this was in interim period as far as legal </p><p>authority in Iraq was concerned, he stated that the </p><p>UAEG would like to have some reference for taking </p><p>action with regard to Iraqi diplomatic facilities. </p><p>Charge replied that the steps being requested had been </p><p>communicated by the Iraqi MFA to Iraqi missions. </p><p>Abdullah Rashed suggested that it would be helpful for </p><p>the Iraqi MFA to communicate directly with host </p><p>governments regarding status of Iraqi missions and </p><p>noted that the UAE Embassy was functioning in Baghdad. </p><p>Charge replied that we were communicating on behalf of </p><p>the Iraqi MFA because it was constrained in its </p><p>ability to communicate with governments after having </p><p>instructed its diplomatic personnel abroad to cease </p><p>all diplomatic and consular activities.  Abdullah </p><p>Rashed undertook to study the request and get back to </p><p>us. </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
