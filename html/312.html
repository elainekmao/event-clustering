<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 09763 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, KPRP, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 363024 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF SAUDI ARABIAN </p><p>SUBMISSION TO THE 1989 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL.  DRAFT </p><p>VERSION OF CLASSIFIED ANNEX IS BEING SENT SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL POSTS -- </p><p> </p><p>-     A. RESULTS OF 1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>-      IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE JULY 1989 BOMBINGS AT </p><p>MECCA, SAUDI SECURITY FORCES DETAINED A LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>PEOPLE, POSSIBLY RUNNING INTO THE HUNDREDS, BUT MOST WERE </p><p>QUICKLY RELEASED AFTER INTERROGATION.  THE PERSONS </p><p>FINALLY ARRESTED WERE TRIED WITHOUT PUBLICITY AND </p><p>ACCORDING TO SHARIA LAW, THE CUSTOMARY LEGAL PROCEDURE IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR PUBLIC TRIALS OR </p><p>A DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR THE ACCUSED BUT HAS A BUILT-IN </p><p>APPEALS SYSTEM.  ON SEPTEMBER 21, AFTER REVIEW OF THE </p><p>SENTENCES BY TWO DIFFERENT APPEALS BOARDS AND THE KING, </p><p>16 MEN WERE BEHEADED NEAR THE GRAND MOSQUE IN MECCA.  ALL </p><p>WERE SHIA MUSLIMS OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY, ALTHOUGH TWO </p><p>WERE SAID TO BE OF SAUDI AND ONE OF QATARI DESCENT.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, FOUR SHIA OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY WERE </p><p>SENTENCED TO PRISON TERMS AND FLOGGINGS OF 1000 OR 1500 </p><p>LASHES, TO BE GIVEN IN INSTALLMENTS OVER THE TERM OF </p><p>THEIR SENTENCES.  NINE SHIA OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY WERE </p><p>RELEASED WITHOUT PUNISHMENT AND REPATRIATED TO KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>IN AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF OPENNESS, SAUDI </p><p>TELEVISION BROADCAST PICTURES OF THE BOMBING SITES, </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH VICTIMS, AND FULL VIDEOTAPED CONFESSIONS </p><p>BY THE SIXTEEN EXECUTED MEN, WHO DID NOT APPEAR TO BE </p><p>UNDER DURESS AND IN MOST CASES SPOKE CALMLY.  SEVERAL </p><p>STATED IN THEIR CONFESSIONS THAT THEY OBTAINED THE </p><p>EXPLOSIVES USED IN THE BOMBS THROUGH THE IRANIAN EMBASSY </p><p>IN KUWAIT, BUT SAUDI MEDIA DID NOT INITIALLY STRESS THE </p><p>IRANIAN ELEMENT IN THE CASE.  AFTER AN INITIAL PERIOD OF </p><p>RESTRAINT, HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN MEDIA CRITICIZED SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA HARSHLY FOR THE EXECUTIONS, AT WHICH POINT THE </p><p>SAUDI MEDIA BEGAN TO DEAL MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT.  THE SAUDIS ALSO </p><p>PUBLICIZED MESSAGES OF SUPPORT FOR THE TRIALS AND </p><p>EXECUTIONS BY OTHER MUSLIM GOVERNMENTS AND BY MUSLIM </p><p>RELIGIOUS BODIES, INCLUDING SEVERAL SHIA GROUPS IN THE </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCE.  NO EVIDENCE WAS EVER PUBLISHED OF </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASE BY SAUDI SHIA, AND SOME EASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE SHIA REPORTEDLY SENT A LETTER TO THE KING </p><p>SUPPORTING THE SENTENCES AND CONDEMNING THE BOMBINGS. </p><p> </p><p>-     B. STATEMENTS BY HOST COUNTRY IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON A TERRORISM ISSUE: </p><p> </p><p>-     SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH STATEMENTS IN </p><p>1989.  IN FACT, HIGH OFFICIALS STRONGLY CONDEMNED </p><p>TERRORISM ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, MOST NOTABLY AT THE </p><p>TIME OF THE MECCA BOMBINGS NOTED ABOVE, BUT ALSO ON THE </p><p>OCCASION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST SAUDI PERSONNEL AND </p><p>PROPERTY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DURING 1989, </p><p>AND FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MOAWAD OF </p><p>LEBANON.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT NEVER MADE ANY OFFICIAL </p><p>COMMENT ON THE RUSHDIE CASE.  THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE, </p><p>HEADQUARTERED IN MECCA, AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC), HEADQUARTERED IN JEDDAH, BOTH </p><p>PASSED RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING RUSHDIE\'S BOOK AND URGING </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL BOYCOTT OF IT, BUT AN IRANIAN PROPOSAL </p><p>THAT THE OIC ENDORSE IRAN\'S DEATH SENTENCE ON RUSHIE WAS </p><p>TURNED DOWN WITHOUT A VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SPECIFIC POST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>-     A.  REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IN 1989, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA: </p><p> </p><p>-      SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AND </p><p>VOTE AGAINST TERRORISM IN 1989 ON ALL APPROPRIATE </p><p>OCCASIONS.  IN THE FIELD OF ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING, THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER THAT THE </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM UNIT (ATU) OF THE SAUDI SPECIAL FORCES </p><p>(SSF), WHICH BEGAN TRAINING IN 1988, WAS BEING DISBANDED </p><p>AND ITS WEST GERMAN TRAINERS REPATRIATED.  THE REASON </p><p>GIVEN WAS THAT ITS SAUDI COMPONENTS HAD SHOWN THEY NEEDED </p><p>MORE BASIC TRAINING BEFORE THEY COULD ABSORB THE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES TAUGHT BY THE WEST GERMANS. </p><p>FOLLOWING A NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTS OR THREATS AGAINST </p><p>SAUDI DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL ABROAD, THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS INITITATED A PROGRAM OF COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE DIPLOMATIC SECURITY DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>STATE, AIMED AT SETTING UP AN EMBASSY GUARD SERVICE AND A </p><p>SYSTEM OF REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICES SIMILAR TO THAT USED </p><p>BY U.S. MISSIONS.  SEVERAL SAUDI OFFICIALS FROM THE </p><p>MINISTRY\'S SECURITY OFFICE TRAVELLED TO THE U.S. FOR </p><p>TRAINING IN WASHINGTON AND AT QUANTICO, AND A STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT MOBILE TRAINING TEAM VISITED RIYADH TO OFFER </p><p>A SHORT COURSE IN THREAT AWARENESS AND SELF-DEFENSE TO </p><p>MINISTRY PERSONNEL.  THE DEPARTMENT\'S THREAT ASESSMENT </p><p>DIVISION ALSO SENT A TEAM TO SAUDI ARABIA TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>THE SAUDIS ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION IN THE FIELD OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE EXECUTIONS OF THE MECCA BOMBERS, AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT THREATS OF RETALIATION BY HIZBULLAH AND OTHER </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, SAUDI SECURITY AGENCIES INTENSIFIED </p><p>INTERNAL CONTROLS, ESPECIALLY IN AIRPORTS AND IN THE </p><p>RIYADH AREA.  THESE PRECAUTIONS WERE GRADUALLY RELAXED IN </p><p>THE FOLLOWING WEEKS, BUT AS OF EARLY DECEMBER, POLICE </p><p>WERE CONTINUING TO SET UP ROADBLOCKS AND CARRY OUT </p><p>IDENTIFICATION CHECKS ON AN APPARENTLY RANDOM BASIS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE RIYADH AREA. </p><p> </p><p>-     B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING </p><p>EXTRADITION ACTIONS, ACTIONS ON TERRORISM AFFECTING </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES, OR DEALING WITH OTHER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>-     AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS </p><p>CALLED INTO PLAY FOR THE TRIAL OF THE 29 PERSONS ARRESTED </p><p>FOR THE MECCA BOMBINGS.  AFTER THE TRIAL BEFORE A SHARIA </p><p>COURT, THE SENTENCES WERE REVIEWED BY A CASSATION COURT, </p><p>NEXT BY A HIGHER APPEALS COURT, AND FINALLY BY THE KING, </p><p>WHICH IS STANDARD PRACTICE IN ALL SAUDI CASES INVOLVING </p><p>THE DEATH PENALTY.  THOSE INVOLVED IN THE MECCA CASES </p><p>WERE ACTUALLY TRIED FOR THE CRIME OF "APOSTASY", BASED ON </p><p>THEIR DISRUPTION OF THE HAJJ, RATHER THAN UNDER THE 1988 </p><p>DECREE ON TERRORISM, SABOTAGE AND HIJACKING. </p><p> </p><p>-     C. SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, INCLUDING POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER </p><p>PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO </p><p>TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING VOTING </p><p>RECORDS: </p><p> </p><p>-       THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE POLITICAL </p><p>OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST TERRORIST ACTS IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI OFFICIALS MAKE A CAREFUL </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM AND SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE PLO, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION MOVEMENT, AND WERE ONE OF THE FIRST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO EXTEND RECOGNITION TO THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>"STATE."  WHILE SUPPORTING THE PLO BOTH POLITICALLY AND </p><p>FINANCIALLY (INDEED, IT IS ONE OF THAT ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>LEADING DONORS), SAUDI ARABIA DECRYS ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAUSE.  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN SANCTUARY FOR </p><p>TERRORISTS, NOR DOES IT MISUSE DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO </p><p>SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
