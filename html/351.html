<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 02527 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  PEACE BREAKING OUT IN THE NORTH? </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EXHAUSTED BY FRATRICIDE AND WEAKENED BY </p><p>HUNGER,FEUDING TRIBES IN NORTHWEST SOMALIA MAY AT LAST </p><p>BE READY TO MAKE PEACE AMONG THEMSELVES, WITH SNM, AND </p><p>WITH GSDR.  SOMALI ARMY "WARLORDS" IN THE NORTH HAVE </p><p>ALREADY WITHDRAWN FROM THE FRAY TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO </p><p>BUSINESS DEALS, AND SNM COMMANDERS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO </p><p>SIMILAR ENTERPRISES TO KEEP FROM STARVING.  RESIDUAL </p><p>FIGHTING IS LITTLE MORE THAN INTER-TRIBAL RAIDING.  OUR </p><p>SOURCE SAYS EVERYONE IS READY TO LAY DOWN ARMS AND PEACE </p><p>TALKS ARE SPROUTING LIKE MUSHROOMS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  COLONEL OMAR ABDULLAHI HANDE, A GADABOURSI (FROM </p><p>BORAMA) CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH ARMED FORCES COMMANDER </p><p>GENERAL "MASLAH", CALLED ON AMBASSADOR ON HIS RETURN FROM </p><p>SIX WEEKS IN NORTHWEST SOMALIA MARCH 12.  HE TOLD US HE </p><p>HAD JUST MADE FOLLOWING POINTS IN A REPORT TO PRESIDENT </p><p>SIAD: </p><p>- </p><p>-- PROFITEERING "WARLORDS" HAD TAKEN FULL CHARGE OF </p><p>SOMALI ARMY FORCES STATIONED IN THE NORTHWEST.  HE FOUND </p><p>NONE/NONE PROSECUTING THE WAR AGAINST SNM.  INSTEAD, </p><p>ALL SENIOR COMMANDERS WERE DEVOTING THEMSELVES ENTIRELY </p><p>TO BUSINESS DEALS, SELLING SOLDIERS\' RATIONS, FUEL, AND </p><p>AMMUNITION TO BOTH SNM AND TRIBAL FIGHTERS. </p><p>- </p><p>-- FIGHTING NOW GOING ON WAS CONDUCTED ALMOST </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY BY TRIBAL MILITIAS OR "FRONTS" AND WAS AIMED </p><p>AT PRESERVING TRIBAL TERRITORIES, HERDS, WATERHOLES, AND </p><p>GRAZING AREAS AGAINST ENCROACHMENTS BY OTHERS (OFTEN BUT </p><p>NOT ALWAYS SNM).  SOLDIERS BELONGING TO LOCAL CLANS HAD </p><p>DESERTED THEIR UNITS AND SHED THEIR UNIFORMS IN ORDER TO </p><p>FIGHT ALONGSIDE TRIBAL BROTHERS; THOSE FROM OUTSIDE THE </p><p>REGION HAD SIMPLY WITHDRAWN TO TOWNS TO WAIT OUT THE WAR. </p><p>- </p><p>-- TRADE IN GUNS AND AMMUNITION HAD BECOME HIGHLY </p><p>PROFITABLE FOR ARMY OFFICERS, SINCE BOTH SNM AND ALLIES </p><p>AND THEIR TRIBAL OPPONENTS WERE BIDDING UP PRICES. </p><p>COMMANDERS WERE ALSO PROFITLNG FROM DESERTION OF THEIR </p><p>TROOPS BY SIMPLY POCKETING SALARIES. </p><p>- </p><p>-- MANY DISPLACED PERSONS (I.E. ISAAKS) WOULD HAVE </p><p>RETURNED HOME LONG AGO HAD THEY NOT BEEN DETERRED FROM </p><p>DOING SO BY BOTH/BOTH SNM AND GOVERNMENT FORCES.  GROWING </p><p>NUMBERS WERE NOW RETURNING, BECAUSE AUTHORITY ON BOTH </p><p>SIDES HAD PRACTICALLY COLLAPSED AND ISAAKS, SUFFERING </p><p>FROM THIRST, HUNGER, DISEASE, AND ABOMINABLE CAMP </p><p>CONDITIONS, WERE DEMANDING TO GO HOME. </p><p>- </p><p>-- AMONG THEMSELVES, TRIBAL LEADERS -- REALIZING THEY HAD </p><p>BECOME VICTIMS AND PAWNS IN THE WAR BETWEEN SIAD AND SNM -- </p><p>WERE NEGOTIATING PEACE AGREEMENTS ON ALL SIDES.  ISAAKS OF </p><p>HABR TOLJALQ   AND HABR YUNIS CLANS HAD SIGNED A TRUCE </p><p>WITH DOLBAHANTA FROM LAS ANOD.  ISAAKS FROM HARGEISA AND </p><p>BORAMA HABR AWAL WERE SUING QADABOURSI FOR PEACE ALONG </p><p>THEIR COMMON TERRITORIAL BORDER EAST OF BORAMA.  A SIMILAR </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN GADABOURSI AND ISSA APPEARED WITHIN </p><p>REACH. </p><p>- </p><p>-- CLOSURE OF DJIBOUTI-BORAMA HIGHWAY HAD BADLY HURT </p><p>COMMUNITIES ALONG THAT ROAD AND FORCED PRICES SKY HIGH IN </p><p>BORAMA.  A 50 KILO BAG OF RICE NOW COST MORE THAN 80,000 </p><p>SO.SH., OR ABOUT TWELVE TIMES THE PRICE OF AN AVERAGE </p><p>GOAT.  HOWEVER, GADABOURSI IN BORAMA HAD ESTABLISHED </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TRADE LINKS VIA BERBERA AND WERE RUNNING </p><p>CONVOYS UNDER ARMED (NON-MILITARY) ESCORT FOUR TIMES A </p><p>MONTH, CARRYING LIVESTOCK TO BERBERA PORT AND RETURNING </p><p>WITH SUPPLIES OF FOOD.  (COLONEL OMAR COMMENTED THAT IT </p><p>WAS NOW DJIBOUTI ITSELF THAT WAS SUFFERING MOST FROM </p><p>CLOSURE OF THE ROAD AND LOSS OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  AMBASSADOR COMMENTED TO COLONEL OMAR HE HAD HEARD FROM </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SAMANTAR THAT A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH SNM </p><p>MIGHT BE CONCLUDED AS EARLY AS APRIL.  OMAR SAID THIS WAS </p><p>NOT/NOT BEYOND POSSIBILITY, AS THE SNM LEADERSHIP WAS </p><p>ITSELF COLLAPSING, ITS FORCES HAD TAKEN SEVERAL SEVERE </p><p>DEFEATS AT THE HANDS OF GADABOURSI AND OTHER TRIBAL </p><p>"FRONTS" IN RECENT WEEKS, AND ISAAK ELDERS WERE PROBING </p><p>FOR PEACE DEALS AMONG BOTH OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS AND GSDR </p><p>ITSELF.  SNM LEADERS WERE NO LONGER "TALKING SO TOUGH" </p><p>AS THEY HAD BEFORE AND ARE SO DIVIDED THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO HOLD THEIR SCHEDULED CONGRESS.  INDEED, COLONEL OMAR </p><p>SAID, THEY HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SAME HABITS AS SOMALI </p><p>ARMY OFFICERS: USING TRUCKS DONATED BY ISAAK SUPPORTERS TO </p><p>TRANSPORT KHAT AND FOR OTHER PRIVATE COMMERICAL PURPOSES. </p><p>GIVEN THIS SITUATION, PLUS SAMANTAR GOVERNMENT\'S APPARENT </p><p>DETERMINATION TO REACH AGREEMENT SOON IN ORDER TO HOLD </p><p>ELECTIONS, COLONEL OMAR BELIEVED THAT SAMANTAR JUST MIGHT </p><p>BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ONE INTERESTING SIDELIGHT: WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF </p><p>NOMADIC FIGHTERS ON BOTH SIDES OR THE BORDER AND SOLDIERS </p><p>FROM BOTH SIDES SELLING THEIR GUNS TO BUY FOOD, BIGGEST </p><p>PURCHASERS OF WEAPONS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE THE OROMO </p><p>LIBERATION FRONT.  OMAR POINTED OUT THAT THE OLF (WHICH </p><p>COUNTS ON BACKING FROM SOME 22 MILLION OROMOS, OMAR SAID) </p><p>NOW SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MENGISTU\'S </p><p>SETBACKS AT THE HANDS OF ERITREANS AND TIGRAYANS AND HAVE </p><p>SUDDENLY GROWN VERY AMBITIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  COLONEL OMAR\'S ASSIGNMENT, WE INFER, WAS TO </p><p>INSURE THAT THE GADABOURSI AROUND BORAMA REMAIN FIRMLY </p><p>ENROLLED ON THE SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT (THEY ARE IN FACT </p><p>SURROUNDED BY ANTI-GOVERNMENT ISAAK AND ISSA FORCES THAT </p><p>HAVE BEEN TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO BRING BORAMA TO ITS </p><p>KNEES).  OMAR SEEMS TO HAVE GONE BEYOND HIS ASSIGNMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, TO SURVEY THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL SITUATION </p><p>GENERALLY IN THE NORTHWEST.  HIS REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>HAS BOTH BAD NEWS AND GOOD NEWS:  AN UTTERLY INEFFECTIVE </p><p>AND CORRUPT SOMALI ARMY FORCE FACING AN EQUALLY INEFFECTUAL </p><p>AND EXHAUSTED INSURGENCY.  OMAR BELIEVES EVERYONE IS TIRED </p><p>OF THE WAR NOW AND LOOKING FOR PEACE AND WE HOPE HE\'S </p><p>RIGHT.  CERTAINLY PRIME MINISTER SAMANTAR IS COUNTING </p><p>HEAVILY ON THE FATIGUE FACTOR, AS HE MOUNTS HIS RELIEF </p><p>OPERATION FOR RETURNED ISAAKS IN BURAO AND PROMISES A </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.  PERHAPS THERE IS LIGHT </p><p>AT THE END OF THIS DREADFULLY LONG TUNNEL. </p><p> </p><p>CRIGLER </p><p></p></div>
