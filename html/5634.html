ANKARA 1003 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 861 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On February 6-7, Treasury U/S Taylor and his </p><p>delegation met with a GOT delegation, led by Minister of </p><p>State in charge of Treasury Ali Babacan, which included </p><p>Treasury, Central Bank, and State Planning officials, and </p><p>Babacan\'s academic economist advisor.  Minister of Finance </p><p>Kemal Unakitan also participated in the talks, and Taylor had </p><p>a separate meeting on the trade package with State Minister </p><p>for Foreign Trade Kursad Tuzmen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Agreement was reached on the term sheet for the </p><p>loan/grant facility, with the exception of six brackets.  The </p><p>main bracketed issue concerns economic reform conditionality: </p><p> the Turks agree to completion of the Fourth Review with the </p><p>IMF as a condition precedent, but otherwise want no reference </p><p>to IFI programs in the conditions, and at least some part of </p><p>the GOT team (MinFin Unakitan) wants no conditions on the </p><p>grant portion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Turks raised four other issues outside the term </p><p>sheet: an economic MOU to complement the military and </p><p>political MOUs; a contingency portion of the facility in case </p><p>Turkey\'s economy is worse than expected; a bridge or other </p><p>short-term loan before Congressional approval; and a list of </p><p>trade and Iraq-related concessions that goes well beyond our </p><p>trade package.  Taylor dispensed with the contingency portion </p><p>(impossible) and the trade list (we already gave a generous </p><p>package), and said we\'d get back on the other two, but the </p><p>Turks may be expected to raise all four again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Turks agreed to defer the magnitude issue while we </p><p>finalized the terms, but again raised it at the end of </p><p>Taylor\'s visit, asking for $92 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Embassy would like instructions for use by the </p><p>Ambassador on the Economic MOU by our COB February 10, and </p><p>for the U.S. del to plan to return to Ankara by February 12, </p><p>with a view to finalizing our package before the February 18 </p><p>parliamentary vote.   See action request at para. 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Magnitude of the Facility </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Babacan stressed, in opening remarks 2/6 and 2/7, the </p><p>Turkish main concern with the amount or magnitude of our </p><p>package. He referred several times to the GOT charts claiming </p><p>GNP losses from the 1991 Gulf War, and estimating GNP losses </p><p>from a new conflict in Iraq at over $100 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Taylor responded that there\'s enormous variation in </p><p>GNP forecasts (Turkey\'s own forecast for 2002 GNP growth was </p><p>3 percent, but it ended up close to 7 percent), that GNP </p><p>losses cannot be attributed solely to one factor like the </p><p>Iraq conflict, that Turkish estimates didn\'t catch the </p><p>enormous positives of a free Iraq, and that our package was </p><p>designed to contain GNP effects by affecting Turkish real </p><p>interest rates and the exchange rate.  He stressed that our </p><p>package was huge - as much as 10 percent of Turkey\'s GNP </p><p>given the loan options.  The Ambassador and Taylor asked </p><p>Babacan to set aside the discussion of the numbers, and urged </p><p>the Turks to reach agreement on all other issues related to </p><p>the economic assistance package in these discussions. </p><p>Babacan agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The magnitude issue came up at the end of the talks, </p><p>in a one-on-one discussion late 2/7 with Babacan and </p><p>MinFinance Unakitan, which followed Taylor\'s meetings with PM </p><p>Gul and MFA U/S Ziyal.  Babacan and Unakitan told Taylor </p><p>their number for the bilateral support package should be $92 </p><p>billion.  Taylor responded that that number was unacceptable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Request for Comprehensive MOU </p><p>On Economic Assistance </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In the initial session 2/6, Taylor tabled the draft </p><p>term sheet, and the Turks agreed to provide comments on it. </p><p>On 2/7, the Turks also tabled a document, a "Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding for Economic Assistance Program between the </p><p>Republic of Turkey acting by and through (the </p><p>Undersecretariat of Treasury) and the United States of </p><p>America acting by and through (blank)."  Babacan said the GOT </p><p>wanted three MOUs - for the political, military, and economic </p><p>aspects - and the economic MOU should include all the </p><p>agreements and understandings related to economic assistance, </p><p>including "bridge financing," the grant/loan facility, oil </p><p>support, and "immediate and medium term economic cooperation </p><p>and support" which could include trade concessions and </p><p>procurement commitments.  (Embassy faxed the draft MOU to </p><p>EUR/SE on 2/8.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Taylor said he could not agree to the concept of an </p><p>economic  MOU without instructions from Washington.  His </p><p>instructions were to reach agreement on the terms of the </p><p>grant/loan facility.  He strongly doubted that some elements </p><p>of the draft MOU - oil support for instance - could be put in </p><p>writing. Conferring with the Ambassador, he asked the Turks </p><p>to defer discussion of the MOU as a format issue, and instead </p><p>to focus on the substance of the terms in our term sheet. </p><p>The substance of these terms could be incorporated in </p><p>whatever documents we later decide to sign.  Babacan agreed, </p><p>noting that a major part of the MOU concerned the grant/loan </p><p>facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Requests for a Additional Contingency </p><p>Portion of the Facility, and for a Bridge Loan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Contingency Portion.  Babacan, referring to the GOT\'s </p><p>draft MOU, said an important element of the grant/loan </p><p>facility to the Turks was "adaptability." He explained this </p><p>to mean a USG commitment now to seek an additional support </p><p>package, if the military operation takes longer or if other </p><p>things occur which increase the damage to Turkey from the </p><p>operation. Taylor replied that we could not build in such a </p><p>contingency.  This was not the way our or other legislatures </p><p>worked.  Our facility preserves flexibility in the loan </p><p>terms, and Taylor stressed this was an unprecedented </p><p>arrangement for the USG.   The loan terms (interest rate, </p><p>maturity) were flexible to allow us to respond to changing </p><p>circumstances, but the budget cost amount we are seeking from </p><p>Congress could not be re-opened, and he stated that </p><p>legislatively this was impossible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Bridge Loan.  Both Babacan and Treasury Under </p><p>Secretary Oztrak stressed the need for a short-term "bridge </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>loan" component of our assistance.  They noted GOT </p><p>vulnerability in March to debt roll-over concerns (on both </p><p>March 5 and 19 there is a $2.5 billion debt payment to the </p><p>markets, ref b).  They  doubted that the USG announcement of </p><p>intention to seek a support package for Turkey would be </p><p>sufficient to calm market concerns in March.  Taylor </p><p>explained that we can only bridge to something concrete and </p><p>very short-term, citing the five-day bridge loan to Uruguay. </p><p>If Turkey were in position to complete its IMF Fourth Review, </p><p>and a board date were established, perhaps we could bridge to </p><p>it.  Babacan replied that if "bridge financing" were </p><p>impossible, the USG should consider some other form of </p><p>short-term financing, prior to Congressional approval of the </p><p>grant/loan facility, stating that this was a "critical" need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Taylor reiterated that he saw no way for the USG to </p><p>do this, but agreed to take the matter back to Washington. </p><p>He stressed that he wanted Babacan and the GOT to understand </p><p>the trade-offs involved.  We had just put together a very </p><p>generous trade package for Turkey which had been very </p><p>difficult to do, but was considered insufficient by the </p><p>Turkish side (see below).  There were trade-offs involved in </p><p>every new request, he cautioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Term Sheet Issues - Economic Reform Conditionality </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Most of the full day talks on 2/7 focused on the </p><p>draft term sheet, and agreement was reached on all terms with </p><p>the exception of six brackets (ref a).  Taylor stressed that </p><p>the term sheet was an informal document, and that final terms </p><p>would be spelt out in a different document, such as a loan </p><p>agreement, but would incorporate terms we agreed on now. </p><p>Turkish remaining concerns are as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Economic reform conditionality.  Babacan agreed that </p><p>completion of the Fourth Review with the IMF was a condition </p><p>precedent, but otherwise wanted to "keep separate" the USG </p><p>facility and the IMF/World Bank programs, both in the </p><p>condition precedent and cause for termination terms.  He also </p><p>questioned the "subjectivity" of this condition, saying "who </p><p>will judge whether our policies are strong enough?" </p><p>Separately, MinFinance Unakitan said he agreed with economic </p><p>reform conditionality on loans, but not on grants.  Grants </p><p>were a gesture of friendship, he stressed, and they should be </p><p>unconditional.  Asked if this was the GOT position, Babacan </p><p>agreed that grants should be unconditional, and </p><p>conditionality on loans should more generally refer to </p><p>"strong economic policies" without reference to the IFIs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Taylor responded that economic reform conditionality is </p><p>needed for market confidence.  Since Turkey is committed to </p><p>an IMF-backed reform program, it\'s needed here to give </p><p>markets assurance that this program will be fully </p><p>implemented.  Cutting references to the IFI-supported </p><p>programs would be harmful. Taylor stressed that the reference </p><p>to "strong economic policies" allows for adjustments in </p><p>circumstances.  Furthermore, responding to Unakitan, he said </p><p>that both grants and concessional loans are gestures of </p><p>friendship. (Unakitan nodded.)  Taylor said to achieve the </p><p>purpose of the Facility - to contain the economic impact from </p><p>a conflict in Iraq - required two elements working together. </p><p>"We\'re doing the grant/loan facility, and you\'re doing your </p><p>part, the good policies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Other concerns.  Babacan didn\'t want "full military </p><p>cooperation" either as a condition precedent or a cause for </p><p>termination, stating that this issue would be solved shortly </p><p>by signing of the military MOU.  We agreed to keep the term </p><p>in, but to bracket language "to be defined."  The remaining </p><p>brackets were requested by the Turks for the default and </p><p>penalty terms.  Babacan said he didn\'t want to contemplate </p><p>what the situation Turkey would be in if these terms became </p><p>operable.  Oztrak wanted to check if our language was </p><p>consistent with Turkey\'s World Bank loans.  (Treasury DG </p><p>Ekren produced such loan  documents and they looked </p><p>substantially the same as our language.)  Taylor said legal </p><p>documents such as loan agreements needed to contemplate such </p><p>eventualities, though no one wanted them; he also noted this </p><p>language was used in USAID loans and required by us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  General tone of the language.  On 2/7 morning, Babacan </p><p>said having read the term sheet overnight, that it sounded </p><p>like terms given by the IMF to Argentina, not the provision </p><p>of a loan or grant facility to an ally.  He asked that the </p><p>language reflect to the extent possible the  context of two </p><p>allies countries going to war against a joint enemy, though </p><p>he offered no specifics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trade Package </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) After Taylor\'s meeting with PM Gul (septel), Babacan </p><p>set up an evening meeting for the U.S. del with State </p><p>Minister for Foreign Trade Kursad Tuzmen.   Babacan said the </p><p>GOT\'s proposals on trade would be part of the Economic MOU </p><p>(in Article VI on "Immediate Support Mechanism") and Tuzmen </p><p>had contributed to this list of proposals.  (He later </p><p>explained that the list, faxed to EUR/SE, included both </p><p>Tuzmen proposals, printed in bold, and Treasury and MFA </p><p>proposals, in non-bold type face.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Tuzmen devoted his time with Taylor to a long-winded </p><p>justification of his focus on expanding Turkey\'s trade with </p><p>its neighbors, which is at present only 5 percent of Turkey\'s </p><p>foreign trade.  "And why only 5 percent?  Because our </p><p>neighbors are either enemies or potential enemies of the </p><p>U.S."  Taylor asked Dep Assistant USTR Mowery to explain our </p><p>trade package.   After listening, Tuzmen said he appreciated </p><p>this effort, but "frankly this is peanuts."  He said GSP </p><p>expansion was good (note: in fact it is on item 15 of the </p><p>Turkish list), but the QIZ U.S. input condition needed to be </p><p>changed.  Turkey imports 400,000 metric tons of cotton fiber </p><p>per year, and U.S. cotton should be the input condition </p><p>"provided your price is right."  Turkey has sufficient </p><p>production of fabric and yarn, he said.  In conclusion, he </p><p>stressed "our southeast is bleeding" and among Turkey\'s needs </p><p>was $2 billion for the Turkish Ex-IM Bank (note: in his </p><p>portfolio) which the U.S. should provide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Taylor thanked Tuzmen for his views and suggestions, </p><p>and urged him to consider the trade package which the U.S. </p><p>had designed to help Turkey.  We believe it could lead to $1 </p><p>billion in trade expansion over a short period of time, a </p><p>nearly 20 percent increase in bilateral trade.  In a later </p><p>meeting with Babacan, Taylor responded to the Turkish trade </p><p>list.  Many items on the list had to do with Turkey\'s future </p><p>trade and investment relationship with Iraq, and implied that </p><p>the U.S. would ensure preferential Turkish treatment.  Taylor </p><p>said we couldn\'t do this.  Instead he stressed the </p><p>Afghanistan reconstruction model - the U.S. would work to </p><p>help ensure a level playing field, with the contracts going </p><p>to the best bidders, and this would help Turkish firms.  The </p><p>USG would separately be active with Turkish firms in helping </p><p>publicize opportunities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Term Sheet Next Steps </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Regarding our list of "technical/procedural </p><p>questions" attached to the term sheet, the Turks answered: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The funds should be disbursed to a GOT account held by </p><p>the Central Bank, acting as the GOT\'s agent, with the Federal </p><p>Reserve Bank of New York.  The GOT may set up a new </p><p>sub-account of the existing account to hold the funds, as was </p><p>done with the $200 million in ESF disbursed in November 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Treasury Undersecretariat will be in charge of </p><p>operational issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOT will not engage outside legal counsel. Instead it </p><p>will rely on its in-house lawyers, and requests that the U.S. </p><p>team return to Ankara to work with them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Typically, a loan agreement doesn\'t require parliamentary </p><p>approval.  The GOT needs to examine whether this one will </p><p>require such approval, given the references to military </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Central Bank will play a role, as agent for the GOT </p><p>in the NY Fed account. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Embassy recommends Washington agencies consider the </p><p>following two next steps: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Provide Ambassador with instructions to go back to the </p><p>GOT on the economic MOU.  These instructions should say </p><p>whether the USG is willing to negotiate an economic MOU, and </p><p>should include our description of the format of the documents </p><p>we foresee signing to complete the economic assistance </p><p>package. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  U.S. Del should plan to return to Ankara by 2/12, with a </p><p>view to finalizing the documents before the parliamentary </p><p>vote on 2/18 in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) U/S Taylor did not have the opportunity to clear </p><p>this message before departing Ankara 2/8. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
