<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001765 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR - MELLE </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4320/MAC/WH/ON/OIA/BENDER AND </p><p>ITA/IA/TERPSTRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, CA, Softwood lumber </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOFTWOOD LUMBER:  CANADIAN REACTIONS TO USDOC </p><p>       POLICY BULLETIN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 OTTAWA 844 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  Canadian reactions to the USDOC policy </p><p>bulletin on softwood lumber, which was released by </p><p>Undersecretary Grant Aldonas on June 18, were mildly </p><p>positive except in Quebec where there was broad </p><p>disappointment that the section concerning that </p><p>province was excluded from the document.  Whatever </p><p>reactions may emerge, nothing in the bulletin can have </p><p>come as a surprise given the extensive process that </p><p>generated it, and there is currently no alternative </p><p>"exit strategy" from the dispute.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   In March 2002 (reftel), when USDOC imposed anti-dumping </p><p>and countervailing duties on softwood lumber from Canada, </p><p>Mission Canada witnessed some of the strongest criticism of </p><p>U.S. trade policy in a decade.  The fact that the release of </p><p>the policy bulletin made scarcely a ripple in the media </p><p>shows just how much the political temperature around this </p><p>issue has cooled.  Yet the economic stakes are as high as </p><p>ever.  Indeed, on June 20 two major Quebec-based players, </p><p>Domtar and Tembec, announced a restructuring of their money- </p><p>losing mills in Eastern Canada (this announcement was </p><p>reported without mention of the policy bulletin). </p><p> </p><p>3.    Quebec business and political players expressed </p><p>disappointment that their province was not covered by the </p><p>bulletin, and focused on responding to this situation, which </p><p>press commentators interpreted as threatening to isolate </p><p>Quebec from other provinces in negotiations with U.S. </p><p>interests.  Quebec Forest Industry Council head Georges </p><p>Courteau said Quebec "must pursue talks with with a set of </p><p>new ideas to put on the table."  Quebec Natural Resources </p><p>Minister Sam Hamad said the province would make use of the </p><p>comment period to submit further explanation of Quebec\'s </p><p>practices. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Representatives of integrated, western-based producer </p><p>Weyerhaeuser Canada, when interviewed the day before </p><p>publication, were supportive of the policy bulletin process, </p><p>and said they also support the use of interim measures for </p><p>up to two years or so provided they are part of an "exit </p><p>strategy" leading to a permanent solution. </p><p> </p><p>5.   B.C. Lumber Trade Council President John Allan was </p><p>quoted calling the bulletin "a significant step" and said he </p><p>was "pretty confident we can show the Americans we\'ve got </p><p>market-based policy reform in B.C."  "Obviously we are </p><p>pleased it has come out," Allan said.  "By and large it is </p><p>consistent with our understanding on what we have discussed </p><p>with the U.S."  Allan was quoted saying that the interim </p><p>aspects of U.S. proposals for resolving the dispute are </p><p>more problematic, and also that while he did not like the </p><p>numbers in the U.S. proposal, it could be enough to get both </p><p>sides back to the negotiating table in coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p>6. B.C. Forests Minister Mike De Jong portrayed the bulletin </p><p>as a necessary step.  "For the first time we are seeing from </p><p>the U.S. federal administration a clear acceptance of the </p><p>notion that we need to establish in clear terms the rules </p><p>upon which we are going to get off this trade dispute </p><p>treadmill.  That has been a fundamental objective of ours in </p><p>British Columbia from the outset." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
