IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05460  01 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>1. (C) ON SEPTEMBER 27 THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION HERE </p><p>SHARED WITH US THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE, CLASSIFIED </p><p>"CONFIDENTIAL" AND SENT SEPTEMBER 22, CONCERNING MDC- </p><p>SPONSORED MASS ACTION IN ZIMBABWE.  PLEASE PROTECT THE </p><p>SOURCE.  MARK LYALL GRANT, REFERRED TO IN PARA. 2, IS A </p><p>SENIOR OFFICER IN THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE\'S </p><p>AFRICA DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>MDC OPPOSITION PARTY PREPARING FOR MASS ACTION NEXT </p><p>MONTH.  PROBABLY LONG-RUNNING GENERAL STRIKE. </p><p>MEMBERSHIP BEING PREPARED THROUGH MPS\' OUTREACH </p><p>MEETINGS.  FORMAL NOTICE WILL BE DELIVERED AT MASS RALLY </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 30.  PARTY LEADERS ANTICIPATE VIOLENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>DETAIL </p><p> </p><p>WITH LYALL GRANT (VISITING) I HAD SEPARATE MEETINGS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 20 AND 21 WITH MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AND HIS DEPUTY, GIBSON SIBANDA, WHO IS ALSO PARTY LEADER </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT.  OUR CALLS FOLLOWED CLOSELY ON THE POLICE </p><p>RAIDS ON THE PARTY OFFICES AND THE STATEMENT BY HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTER NKOMO THAT WEAPONS AND INCRIMINATING </p><p>PAPERS HAD BEEN FOUND. </p><p> </p><p>WE ASKED THEM TO EXPAND ON TSVANGIRAI\'S PASSING </p><p>REFERENCES TO MASS ACTION IN HIS REMARKS TO THE PRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05460  01 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>AFTER NKOMO\'S STATEMENT.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THE PRESSURE </p><p>FROM THE MEMBERSHIP AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE FOR DIRECT </p><p>ACTION WAS HUGE.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFUSAL TO BUDGE FROM </p><p>PRE-ELECTION POSITIONS HAD CREATED ANGER AND </p><p>FRUSTRATION.  MUGABE HAD PUSHED THE PEOPLE TO THE POINT </p><p>WHERE MASS ACTION WAS "NOT NEGOTIABLE". </p><p> </p><p>PLANNING WAS WELL ADVANCED.  THE CORE FEATURE WOULD BE A </p><p>SNAP GENERAL STRIKE.  MDC LEADERS ARE STILL UNDECIDED ON </p><p>ITS DURATION, BUT ONE OPTION DESCRIBED BY SIBANDA WAS TO </p><p>KEEP IT GOING UNTIL MUGABE IS FORCED OUT OF OFFICE.  THE </p><p>PLAN IS FOR ALL MDC MEMBERS AND LIKE-MINDED PARTIES TO </p><p>WORK AS NORMAL UNTIL LUNCHTIME ON A SPECIFIED DAY, </p><p>RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND NOT COME BACK. </p><p> </p><p>NEITHER TSVANGIRAI NOR SIBANDA MENTIONED A DATE, BUT THE </p><p>MESSAGE WILL BE SPELLED OUT IN PLAIN TERMS AT CROSS- </p><p>COUNTRY RALLIES TO BE HELD ON SEPTEMBER 30 TO MARK THE </p><p>MDC\'S FIRST ANNIVERSARY.  THE STRIKE WILL BEGIN WITHIN </p><p>ONE OR TWO WEEKS OF THAT EVENT.  TSVANGIRAI HAS </p><p>CANCELLED A VISIT TO BRUSSELS PLANNED FOR THE FIRST WEEK </p><p>OF OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>MDC MPS AND OFFICIALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ALERTING </p><p>CONSTITUENTS TO THE PLANS FOR MASS ACTION.  WITH </p><p>PARLIAMENT IN RECESS SINCE YESTERDAY, THEY WILL BE </p><p>STEPPING UP THEIR ACTIVITIES NATIONWIDE IN PREPARATION </p><p>FOR SEPTEMBER 30. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE STRIKE WILL BE ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY PLANNED RALLIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, BUT SPONTANEOUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05460  01 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>ACTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGH-DENSITY AREAS IS NOT </p><p>UNLIKELY.  TSVANGIRAI AND SIBANDA BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL CRACK DOWN ON THE MOVEMENT WITH ALL THE </p><p>MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL - VIOLENCE, TEARGAS, ARRESTS, </p><p>THE WHOLE PANOPLY OF THE POLICE STATE.  TSVANGIRAI IS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL NOT BREAK THE MOMENTUM.  HE </p><p>SAID THE ACTION WOULD BE MASSIVE AND COUNTRYWIDE: THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO </p><p>CONTAIN IT.  HE ADDED THAT ONCE THE ACTION HAD BEGUN, IT </p><p>WAS UNLIKELY THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>THE MASS ACTION AS DESCRIBED BY THE TWO MDC LEADERS HAS </p><p>BEEN IN GESTATION FOR SOME TIME.  THEIR ACCOUNT CONFIRMS </p><p>THE REPORTS WE HAVE BEEN GETTING OF MDC PLANNING </p><p>SESSIONS AND WELL-ATTENDED PREPARATORY MEETINGS IN THE </p><p>HARARE CONSTITUENCIES.  THE STRATEGY IS A RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE INCREASING ANGER OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO THE SEVERE </p><p>HARDSHIP OF LIFE IN ZIMBABWE AND THEIR FRUSTRATION AT </p><p>WHAT THEY SEE AS THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFUSAL TO BUDGE FROM </p><p>THE POLICIES AND ATTITUDES WHICH BROUGHT THIS ABOUT. </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI CAN EXPECT MASSIVE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE CITIES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND MATABELELAND, BUT A KEY FACTOR WILL BE THE RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2527 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05460  02 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /008W </p><p>                  ------------------8A8DFD  271459Z /38 </p><p>O 271459Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7211 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005460 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5,6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MORGAN TSVANGIRAI INFORMS BRITISH HIGH </p><p>COMMISSION OF MASS ACTION PLANS </p><p> </p><p>IN THE RURAL AREAS.

TSVANGIRAI HAS NO DOUBT THAT THE CALL FOR </p><p>ACTION WILL SWEEP THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS HIGH RISK.  MUGABE\'S INSTINCT WILL BE TO RESPOND </p><p>WITH THE USUAL BATTERIES OF RIOT POLICE SUPPORTED BY THE </p><p>MILITARY.  HE WILL WISH TO PUT DOWN THE ACTION IN ITS </p><p>EARLY STAGES AND PROBABLY USE IT AS A PRETEXT TO SEIZE </p><p>THE MDC LEADERSHIP.  AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR HIM IS </p><p>WHETHER SUCH A TACTIC WILL ALSO REVERSE THE GROUNDSWELL </p><p>AGAINST HIM WITHIN ZANU-PF OR WHETHER POTENTIAL </p><p>DISSIDENTS AND CHALLENGERS WILL RALLY BEHIND HIM IN THE </p><p>FACE OF A COMMON THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW TO RESPOND TO A POSSIBLY </p><p>EXTENDED PERIOD OF CIVIL STRIFE AND ASSOCIATED </p><p>REPRESSION.
