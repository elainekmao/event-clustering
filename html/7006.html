<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 001380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA KOTOK </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, KUNR, KUNR, FAO AORC, FAO AORC, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO RIGHT TO FOOD WORKING GROUP: REPORT OF FIRST </p><p>SESSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE FIRST SESSION OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01380  01 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>WORKING GROUP FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY </p><p>MET MARCH 24-26, 2003. THE U.S. WAS ELECTED TO THE BUREAU </p><p>AS VICE-CHAIR.  AS EXPECTED, MANY G-77 MEMBERS, SOME OECD </p><p>MEMBERS (NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND) AND MOST NGO\'S PRESENT </p><p>SOUGHT TO MOVE THE DEBATE AWAY FROM "VOLUNTARY," </p><p>"NATIONAL" GUIDELINES TO AN "INTERNATIONAL" AND "LEGALLY </p><p>BINDING" INSTRUMENT.  WHILE THE U.S. IS ALONE IN PUBLICLY </p><p>REJECTING A "RIGHT TO FOOD," WE FEEL THAT WE ARE </p><p>SUPPORTED BY MOST OTHER OECD COUNTRIES IN SEEKING AN </p><p>OUTCOME FOCUSED ON PRACTICAL STEPS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL </p><p>RATHER THAN ON A THEORETICAL "RIGHT TO FOOD." THE BUREAU </p><p>WILL MEET INTER-SESSIONALLY TO PREPARE A FIRST DRAFT OF </p><p>THE GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION TO THE NEXT SESSION IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2003.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FAO CONVENED THE FIRST MEETING OF THE </p><p>INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP FOR THE ELABORATION OF </p><p>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE </p><p>REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY (IGWG-RTF) MARCH 24-26, 2003. </p><p>THE IGWG WAS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 10 OF THE </p><p>DECLARATION OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT: FIVE YEARS LATER </p><p>AND ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR) AGREED BY </p><p>THE 123RD FAO COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>BUREAU AND PARTICIPANTS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3.  PARTICIPANTS IN THE IGWG INCLUDED 83 FAO AND UN </p><p>MEMBERS, 17 INTERNATIONAL NGOS, AS WELL AS UN AND OTHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01380  01 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>SPECIALIZED AGENCIES, THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, THE OFFICE </p><p>OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE UN </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD.  THE GROUP </p><p>ELECTED AMBASSADOR NOURI-NAEENI (IRAN) AS CHAIR, </p><p>AMBASSADOR CHRISTIAN MONNOYER (BELGIUM) AS FIRST VICE- </p><p>CHAIR AND AMBASSADOR GURGEL DE ALENCAR (BRAZIL), MR. </p><p>HAMADOUN CISSE (MALI), MR. PETER BENNET (NEW ZEALAND), </p><p>MR. NOEL D. DE LUNA (PHILIPPINES) AND MS. LUCY TAMLYN </p><p>(U.S.) AS VICE-CHAIRS.  COMMENT: AMBASSADOR MONNOYER, THE </p><p>OECD CANDIDATE FOR CHAIR, WITHDREW HIS CANDIDACY AT THE </p><p>LAST MINUTE IN THE FACE OF STRONG G-77 INTEREST IN THE </p><p>CHAIR.  IN EXCHANGE, IT WAS AGREED THAT MONNOYER WOULD </p><p>SERVE AS THE FIRST VICE-CHAIR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>QUESTION OF RAPPORTEUR </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4.  AS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THE G-77 ASSUMED </p><p>THE CHAIR, THE G-77 OFFERED (AND SOME OECD MEMBERS HAD </p><p>SUPPORTED) CREATING A RAPPORTEUR IN ORDER TO BRING </p><p>ANOTHER OECD MEMBER ONTO THE BUREAU.  THE FIRST ORDER OF </p><p>BUSINESS ASSIGNED TO THE BUREAU WAS DETERMINING WHETHER A </p><p>RAPPORTEUR WAS NEEDED.  (THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>RAPPORTEUR WAS NORWAY.)  USDEL OBJECTED TO CREATING A </p><p>RAPPORTEUR, ARGUING THAT THE POSITION WAS NOT IN THE TOR </p><p>AND TOOK AWAY FROM THE BUREAU\'S ASSIGNED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE BUREAU AGREED THAT IT WOULD NOT </p><p>CREATE A RAPPORTEUR DURING THIS SESSION, BUT RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT SOME COUNTRIES MIGHT WISH TO RAISE THE ISSUE AGAIN </p><p>AT A LATER DATE. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. STATEMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01380  01 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>-------------- </p><p>5.  AMBASSADOR TONY P. HALL DELIVERED THE U.S. OPENING </p><p>STATEMENT.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE IGWG SHOULD FOCUS ON </p><p>PRACTICAL STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>OTHER ACTORS TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE:  INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; CREATING </p><p>AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT; PROMOTING TRANSPARENT AND </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT; BOOSTING AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY; DEVELOPING DOMESTIC MARKET AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRADE OPPORTUNITIES; SECURING PROPERTY RIGHTS AND ACCESS </p><p>TO FINANCE; ENHANCING HUMAN CAPITAL; PROTECTING THE </p><p>VULNERABLE; ADVANCING THE STATUS OF WOMEN; AND </p><p>MAINSTREAMING A GENDER PERSPECTIVE IN NATIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, POLICIES, AND BUDGETS AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE U.S. STATEMENT NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE ATTAINMENT OF THE RIGHT TO AN ADEQUATE </p><p>STANDARD OF LIVING WAS A GOAL OR ASPIRATION TO BE </p><p>REALIZED PROGRESSIVELY THAT DID NOT GIVE RISE TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR DOMESTIC LEGAL ENTITLEMENT; </p><p>NOR DID IT DIMINISH THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TOWARD THEIR CITIZENS.

ALMOST EVERY STATEMENT BY GOVERNMENTS, NGOS, AND UN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES (EXCEPT FOR WFP) SUPPORTED THE "RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD."  HOWEVER, ON EXAMINATION, MOST STATEMENTS REALLY </p><p>DEALT WITH THE "RIGHT TO ACCESS TO FOOD" RATHER THAN THE </p><p>"RIGHT TO FOOD" PER SE.  THE EU STATEMENT INCLUDED </p><p>PRACTICAL MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ACHIEVE FOOD </p><p>SECURITY SUCH AS THE NEED FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE; ADDRESSING </p><p>FOOD SECURITY AS PART OF OVERALL NATIONAL POVERTY </p><p>REDUCTION STRATEGIES; EMPHASIZING GOVERNMENTS\' OBLIGATION </p><p>TO RESPECT AND PROTECT PEOPLE\'S ABILITY TO FEED </p><p>THEMSELVES; ACCESS TO PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES; THE ROLE OF </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY IN DEVELOPING FOOD SECURITY STRATEGIES; THE </p><p>NEED FOR COOPERATION AMONG THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, NGOS, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICIABILITY AND INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  SOME GOVERNMENTS AND NGOS SUPPORTED AN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>"RIGHT" IN THE FULL SENSE OF THE WORD (I.E. INDIVIDUALS </p><p>COULD TAKE LEGAL MEASURES AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENTS IF </p><p>THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOOD) AND "INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS" (I.E. INDIVIDUALS OR STATES COULD TAKE LEGAL </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEIR NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOOD). SPEAKING IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JUSTICIABILITY WERE </p><p>THE UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD, THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01380  02 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>OFFICE OF THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>SWITZERLAND AND NORWAY (WHO MADE JOINT STATEMENTS). OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES AND REGIONS WHICH SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>JUSTICIABILITY WERE ZIMBABWE (SPEAKING FOR THE AFRICAN </p><p>REGION), UGANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA (RTF IS INCLUDED IN </p><p>THEIR CONSTITUTIONS), MALI, BANGLADESH AND DOMINICAN </p><p>REPUBLIC (WHO PROPOSED THAT THE VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES LEAD </p><p>TO A BINDING CODE OF CONDUCT). WHEN THE DOMINICAN </p><p>REPUBLIC DELEGATE SPOKE ON BEHALF OF GRULAC, HE WAS MORE </p><p>MODERATE AND SAID THAT GOVERNMENTS NEEDED GUIDANCE FROM </p><p>THEIR CAPITALS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE G-77 ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE NEED TO INCLUDE </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION AND INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CANADA AND RUSSIA STATED THAT THE VOLUNTARY </p><p>GUIDELINES SHOULD NOT ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS </p><p>OR JUSTICIABILITY.  THE EU WRITTEN SUBMISSION STATED THAT </p><p>THE GUIDELINES SHOULD NOT ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS AND WAS SILENT ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>JUSTICIABILITY.  BRAZIL STATED THAT THE IGWG NEEDED TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT COUNTRIES HAD DIFFERENT LAWS AND DIFFERENT </p><p>RESOURCE BASES AND ARGUED THAT THE IGWG COULD NOT IMPOSE </p><p>ANY OBLIGATIONS ON COUNTRIES BUT MUST RESPECT NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT: IT WAS CLEAR FROM INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>DELEGATES THAT THE NOTION OF "JUSTICIABILITY" WAS POORLY </p><p>UNDERSTOOD.  FOR MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, </p><p>JUSTICIABILITY IMPLIED INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND NOT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01380  02 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>NATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  COUNTRIES PARTY TO THE COVENANCT </p><p>ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL (ESC) RIGHTS WERE NOT </p><p>CLEAR WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p>WOULD BE TO THEIR LEGALLY BINDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE </p><p>COVENANT.  WHILE COMMENT 12 OF THE COMMITTEE ON ESC </p><p>RIGHTS WAS WIDELY SUPPORTED AS A BASIS FOR THE VOLUNTARY </p><p>GUIDELINES, THE FACT THAT COMMENT 12 INCLUDES </p><p>JUSTICIABILITY WAS ALSO NOT RECOGNIZED.  MANY NGO\'S </p><p>ARGUED FOR A LEGALLY BINDING RIGHT TO REINFORCE A GENERAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT, WHICH </p><p>EMPHASIZES THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE RIGHTS AND GOVERNMENTS </p><p>HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR CITIZENS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  OTHER ISSUES THAT RECEIVED ATTENTION WERE: WHETHER </p><p>THE RTF INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO SAFE DRINKING WATER AND </p><p>WHETHER THE RTF TAKES PRIORITY OVER OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  AT THE REQUEST OF MEMBERS THE SECRETARIAT PREPARED A </p><p>DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT HIGHLIGHTING THE MAIN AREAS OF </p><p>CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE.  THE GROUP DISCUSSED THE </p><p>DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT AND PRESENTED COMMENTS AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1704 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01380  03 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  FDRE-01  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   PER-00   IRM-00   SS-00    TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  ECA-00   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------4E3DF7  011150Z /38 </p><p>R 011148Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9054 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2605 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 001380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA KOTOK </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, KUNR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO RIGHT TO FOOD WORKING GROUP: REPORT OF FIRST </p><p>SESSION </p><p> </p><p>CORRECTIONS TO THE SECRETARIAT EFFORT.  THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01380  03 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>CRITICIZED THE DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT AND REQUESTED THAT </p><p>COMMENTS BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE NEXT DRAFT. </p><p>U.S. CORRECTIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT REFERRED TO "EXISTING LEGAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD."  THERE </p><p>ARE NO SUCH EXISTING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. </p><p>-- THE U.S. COULD NOT SUPPORT USING GENERAL COMMENT 12 OF </p><p>THE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS AS </p><p>AN AUTHORITATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE </p><p>FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>THE DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT DID NOTE THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>CONVERGENCE ON THE QUESTION OF JUSTICIABILITY AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE IGWG APPROVED A SHORT REPORT OF THE MEETING </p><p>WHICH THE BUREAU (ACTING AS AN AD-HOC DRAFTING COMMITTEE) </p><p>HAD WORKED ON AND AGREED TO BEFORE PRESENTATION TO THE </p><p>PLENARY. </p><p> </p><p>FUTURE ORGANIZATION OF WORK </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>15.  THE IGWG AGREED THAT MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS COULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO SEND SUBMISSIONS UNTIL APRIL 7, AFTER WHICH </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT WOULD FINALIZE A SYNTHESIS REPORT OF </p><p>SUBMISSIONS.  THE FINALIZED SYNTHESIS REPORT WILL BE </p><p>APPROVED BY THE BUREAU AND SENT TO THE FAO COMMITTEE ON </p><p>FOOD SECURITY IN MAY 2003 ALONG WITH THE IGWG REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE BUREAU WILL PREPARE A FIRST DRAFT OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01380  03 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES (USING THE REVISED "WORKING </p><p>DOCUMENT" FOR INSPIRATION) IN DUE TIME FOR SUBMISSION TO </p><p>THE SECOND SESSION OF THE IGWG (TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>THE LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 2003).  THE THIRD SESSION WILL </p><p>LIKELY OCCUR IN MARCH 2004.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE </p><p>IGWG WILL COMPLETE ITS WORK BY SEPTEMBER 2004. </p><p> </p><p>17.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE BUREAU WOULD REVIEW </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO THE </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, AS WELL AS WORK CLOSELY WITH </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT ON ITS PROPOSED PROGRAM OF WORK.  THE </p><p>U.S. INTERVENTION SUGGESTED LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES AND </p><p>PRACTICAL STEPS TO PROMOTE FOOD SECURITY IN SPECIFIC </p><p>COUNTRIES AND IN GENERAL DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF IDEAS </p><p>WHERE THERE WAS BROAD CONVERGENCE.  OTHER MEMBERS SAW THE </p><p>INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE INTO </p><p>ISSUES OF DIVERGENCE SUCH AS JUSTICIABILITY AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION. USDEL ARGUED THAT ROME DELEGATES </p><p>WERE NOT HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS, AND WERE NOT EXPECTED TO </p><p>ACT AS SUCH: THE RESPONSIBILITY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ROME </p><p>BECAUSE OF EXPERTISE IN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND WE </p><p>SHOULD FOCUS ON OUR AREA OF COMPETENCE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18.  WHILE THE U.S. IS ALONE IN NOT SUPPORTING A "RIGHT </p><p>TO FOOD" WE FEEL THAT WE ARE SUPPORTED BY MANY OECD </p><p>COUNTRIES IN SEEKING A PRACTICAL AND USEFUL OUTCOME WHICH </p><p>IS FOCUSED ON NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY RATHER THAN ON </p><p>JUSTICIABLE, INTERNATIONALLY BINDING OBLIGATIONS. THE </p><p>U.S. IS ALSO WELL POSITIONED IN THAT THE TOR PROVIDE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01380  03 OF 03  011149Z </p><p>BUREAU WITH BROAD DRAFTING POWERS AND OVERSIGHT OVER </p><p>SECRETARIAT ACTIVITIES INTERSESSIONALLY.  THE CHALLENGE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WILL BE TO KEEP OTHER ROME DELEGATES FOCUSED ON "NATIONAL </p><p>FOOD SECURITY" AND ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME THAT IS (AT LEAST) </p><p>AS GOOD AS THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT PLAN OF ACTION.
