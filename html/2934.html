<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR MSCOVILL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, ELAB, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN QIZ UPDATE APRIL 2002 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1616 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3379 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  QIZ exporters and park managers are cautiously </p><p>optimistic for a strong 2002 export season.  Production is </p><p>steady throughout the QIZ\'s, orders are on the rise, and new </p><p>investment interest is beginning to trickle in once more. </p><p>With the apparent passing of the immediate crisis in the West </p><p>Bank, concerns about border access have been muted.  Park </p><p>managers continue to worry about competition from Turkish </p><p>QIZ\'s, particularly as these new QIZ\'s might impact their own </p><p>efforts to diversify out of the textile sector.  Park </p><p>managers would no doubt welcome the chance to take advantage </p><p>of Turkish participation in the initiative, provided that </p><p>this would entail Turkish and/or Israeli investment in </p><p>high-end economic sectors in Jordanian QIZ parks.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>PRODUCTION STEADY, ORDERS UP </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  QIZ-related exports from all of Jordan\'s </p><p>QIZ-designated industrial parks are up in 2002. </p><p>January-April exports from Al Hassan QIZ in Irbid total $67.6 </p><p>million, up from $50.8 million for the same period in 2001. </p><p>In a similar vein, January-April exports from Al Dulayl QIZ </p><p>total $14.4 million, compared to total year exports of $17.8 </p><p>million in 2001.  According to most of our QIZ business </p><p>contacts, orders are coming in at a steady pace.  Many of the </p><p>larger exporters are booked through the end of the fall, </p><p>while smaller companies are booked through the summer.  We </p><p>have nearly completed a survey of all QIZ exporters to guage </p><p>predicted 2002 export volumes.  If company predictions hold </p><p>(as they did for 2001), QIZ-related exports could easily top </p><p>$500 million for 2002.  Of that, we can expect QIZ exports to </p><p>the US to be in the $325-375 million range. </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT STILL A MIXED BAG </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  On the investment side, a number of larger </p><p>companies in each of the four major parks have begun </p><p>ambitious expansion programs.  While new investment interest </p><p>remains relatively low, some park managers are starting to </p><p>get expressions of interest again following the complete </p><p>silence heard after the recent escalation of violence in the </p><p>West Bank.  On the other hand, we are hearing this spring of </p><p>the first QIZ business failures.  We have confirmed two </p><p>closings (one in Irbid and one in Amman), and have heard </p><p>rumors of a third (also in Amman).  The companies that have </p><p>ceased operations were smaller QIZ "sub-contractors," </p><p>processing orders for larger QIZ exporters in the same zones. </p><p> With the business downturn that plagued the sector after </p><p>9/11 and into the beginning of 2002, larger companies stopped </p><p>contracting out orders, putting these smaller companies at </p><p>risk. </p><p> </p><p>OPERATIONS BACK TO NORMAL </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Concerns reported ref a regarding access to </p><p>Israeli inputs and transportation routes have largely melted </p><p>away with the easing of tensions in the West Bank.  Exporters </p><p>and park managers believe the threat is still there, but </p><p>agree that it has not yet materialized.  Partially to help </p><p>allay those fears and partially to spark business in Aqaba, a </p><p>USAID-funded expert is looking into the possibility of </p><p>establishing a dedicated direct shipping route from Aqaba to </p><p>New York or Miami, primarily for QIZ exports.  Two major US </p><p>shipping lines have shown initial interest, provided QIZ </p><p>exporters can send sufficient volume through the port.  If </p><p>the plan materializes, the dedicated route could shave </p><p>several days off shipping times from Aqaba to the U.S. east </p><p>coast, making Aqaba more competitive with Haifa and </p><p>potentially reducing political risk for exporters. </p><p> </p><p>TURKISH QIZ\'S STILL A SORE SPOT </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Park managers and investment promotion officers in </p><p>the GOJ are resigned to the prospect of Turkish QIZ\'s, though </p><p>they are still worried that such a scheme will draw potential </p><p>investors away from Jordanian QIZ parks.  They recognize that </p><p>the garment sector is unlikely to be affected, but are still </p><p>concerned that Turkish zones could "steal" investors in </p><p>higher-tech sectors away from Jordan.  This is particularly </p><p>worrying to GOJ investment promotion officers, who are </p><p>already having a tough time diversifying the QIZ parks out of </p><p>the textile sector. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>6.  (sbu)  As during previous crises, QIZ exporters and park </p><p>managers have shown a pragmatic, gritty ability to weather </p><p>political and economic storms nearby and quietly go about </p><p>improving on past successes.  Absent further major </p><p>disruptions, exporters should be able to come close to their </p><p>$500 million mark.  In addition, we are beginning to hear </p><p>that buyers are looking at Jordan as an alternate sourcing </p><p>base in the run-up to 2005, when textile quotas will be </p><p>eliminated world-wide.  Many top exporting countries have in </p><p>the past been allowed to "borrow" quota from future years to </p><p>increase output in the current year.  As 2004 approaches, </p><p>though, it will be harder for major garment-producing </p><p>countries to "borrow" quota as they have done in the past, </p><p>since quotas will themselves be eliminated in 2005.  The </p><p>additional restrictions imposed by borrowing done in 2002 and </p><p>2003 may further restrict quotas in big producing countries </p><p>in 2003 and 2004.  If this happens, we might expect a </p><p>short-term shift into Jordan of many of the orders cut off by </p><p>more severe quota restrictions in those years, making QIZ </p><p>prospects even more rosy. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  As for the angst over Turkish QIZ\'s, we expect </p><p>that Jordan might actually welcome the development, provided </p><p>it can benefit from some of the new relationships.  If </p><p>Turkish participation generates interest in the initiative </p><p>from more specialized sectors, or if Turkish investors see </p><p>Jordan as a place to do some of their QIZ processing, </p><p>Jordanians may welcome the expansion of the initiative. </p><p>Barring such developments, we expect Jordanian officials and </p><p>park managers to turn a cold shoulder to visiting </p><p>Turkish/Israeli delegations looking at Jordan as a model to </p><p>set up shop elsewhere. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
