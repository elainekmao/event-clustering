(C - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  NABIL SHA\'ATH INFORMED CONSUL GENERAL LATE </p><p>JANUARY 24 THAT FOUR PRINCIPAL ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS IN </p><p>GAZA HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE PPF.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT </p><p>ARAFAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONCRETE </p><p>STEPS AGAINST ISLAMIC RADICALS.  ARAFAT REPORTEDLY </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON RABIN FOLLOWING </p><p>THE BEIT LID BOMBING.  SHA\'ATH COMMENTED THAT RABIN </p><p>NEEDS USG SUPPORT VIS-A-VIS HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOLLOWING NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS BY CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>WITH PA OFFICIALS JANUARY 24 URGING A FIRM PA RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE BEIT LID BOMBING, NABIL SHA\'ATH CALLED CONSUL </p><p>GENERAL TUESDAY EVENING TO INFORM HIM THAT AT ARAFAT\'S </p><p>ORDERS, FOUR PRINCIPAL ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS IN GAZA HAD </p><p>BEEN ARRESTED.  THE FOUR ARE ABDALLAH AL SHAMI, ABDALLAH </p><p>SULIEMAN AL ZUQ, MOHAMMAD ABDALLAH SHALLAH AND OMAR </p><p>MOHAMMAD FURAH.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT SEVERAL GUARDS OF </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD ALSO BEEN ARRESTED.  CONSUL </p><p>GENERAL SAID THAT THIS WAS A GOOD MOVE BUT FOLLOW </p><p>THROUGH WAS VERY IMPORTANT.  IF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE </p><p>HELD FOR A FEW DAYS AND RELEASED, THE ACTION WOULD BE </p><p>MEANINGLESS.  SHA\'ATH SAID HE UNDERSTOOD.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>ARAFAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONCRETE </p><p>MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REFERRING TO RABIN\'S ADDRESS TO THE ISRAELI NATION </p><p>JANUARY 23, SHA\'ATH SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT RABIN HAD </p><p>BEEN VERY STATESMANLIKE IN HIS DETERMINATION TO PROCEED </p><p>WITH THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE SAID THAT HE, ARAFAT AND </p><p>OTHER PALESTINIAN LEADERS UNDERSTOOD THE TREMENDOUS </p><p>PRESSURE THAT RABIN WAS UNDER BECAUSE OF THE BEIT LID </p><p>BOMBING.  AS FOR A STRONG STATEMENT BY ARAFAT CONDEMNING </p><p>THE BOMBING, SHA\'ATH SAID THAT ARAFAT HAD MADE TWO </p><p>SPEECHES IN GAZA JANUARY 24 ATTACKING THE ISLAMISTS FOR </p><p>ACTIONS TAKEN WHICH DAMAGED PALESTINIAN INTERESTS. </p><p>SHA\'ATH SAID THAT THIS WAS THE STRONGEST ATTACK EVER </p><p>AGAINST THE ISLAMIC MILITANTS.  HE REPEATED THAT THERE </p><p>WAS MUCH MORE RESOLVE ON ARAFAT\'S PART TO CONFRONT THE </p><p>MILITANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SHA\'ATH EXPRESSED ANXIETY ABOUT RABIN\'S DOMESTIC </p><p>POSITION AND SAID THAT RABIN NEEDS USG SUPPORT VIS-A-VIS </p><p>HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.  HE ALSO RAISED THE CLOSURE OF </p><p>GAZA AND JERICHO, ASKING FOR U.S. INTERCESSION WITH </p><p>RABIN TO ADVISE HIM AGAINST AN EXTENDED CLOSURE AS </p><p>OCCURRED AFTER THE TEL AVIV BOMBING.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT </p><p>THE MOOD IN GAZA IS CURRENTLY VERY MUCH AGAINST ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD.  HE SAID THAT EVEN HAMAS IS TRYING TO DISTANCE </p><p>ITSELF FROM THE IJ.  HOWEVER, THE LONGER THE CLOSURES </p><p>LAST THE MORE THE AVERAGE PALESTINIAN WILL BLAME THE PA </p><p>FOR THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT WHEN THE CLOSURE HAD BEEN </p><p>INITIALLY IMPOSED, LOCAL IDF UNITS WERE PREVENTING ALL </p><p>TRAFFIC TO AND FROM GAZA INCLUDING BANNING OF FOOD AND </p><p>OTHER SUPPLIES FROM REACHING GAZA AND CUTTING OFF THE </p><p>EXPORT OF FLOWERS AND STRAWBERRIES FROM GAZA.  SHA\'ATH </p><p>SAID HE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO DANNY ROTHSCHILD IN A </p><p>MEETING AT EREZ JANUARY 24 AND ROTHSCHILD HAD </p><p>STRAIGHTENED OUT THE PROBLEM OF THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS TO </p><p>AND FROM GAZA.  ROTHSCHILD ALSO TOLD SHA\'ATH THAT THE </p><p>CLOSURE WOULD LAST NO LONGER THAN THE END OF THE WEEK. </p><p>SHA\'ATH SAID HE HOPES THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. </p><p>7.  NABIL ABU RUDEINA ALSO CONFIRMED TO CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>THAT ARAFAT ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE FOUR ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>LEADERS.  ABU RUDEINA SAID THAT ARAFAT PLANS TO LEAVE </p><p>LATER TODAY FOR HIS MEETING IN AMMAN WITH KING HUSSEIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABINGTON </p><p></p></div>
