<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SSS DG ARE ON BENUE CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 3200 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2985 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2855 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Aware of the international attention to the conflict </p><p>in Benue, State Security Service (SSS) Director General </p><p>Kayode Are briefly gave his insights into the Tiv-Jukun </p><p>inter-communal conflict to Ambassador Jeter on December 11. </p><p>Explaining that the SSS was seen as an impartial party by all </p><p>sides, Are said the SSS was continuing to investigate the </p><p>deaths of the 19 soldiers and the reprisal attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Are explained that many believed that the Tiv were </p><p>originally from Bantu tribes in central and southern Africa, </p><p>and had moved from Cameroon into the Jukun controlled </p><p>Kwararafa Empire (covering most of west-central Nigeria) in </p><p>the 18th century.  However, the Tiv disagreed with much of </p><p>this history, and in any case, they had lived in the area too </p><p>long to still be considered settlers.  Are flatly stated that </p><p>both sides were attempting to use history, and sometimes </p><p>revisionist history, to support their claims to control. </p><p>These misguided sentiments were obstacles to political </p><p>settlement and peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Are identified several factors that impeded political </p><p>solution and led to conflict between the Tiv and Jukun. </p><p>Unemployed youth in the area, both Tiv and Jukun, were </p><p>setting up roadblocks to take tolls and were always at hand </p><p>to attack another group.  Are stated that these youth had no </p><p>political agenda, but were easy tools of those who did. </p><p>Explaining that he had spoken to some notable political </p><p>actors on both sides of the conflict, Are said that some </p><p>efforts, including the formation of a seven-member peace </p><p>committee, had been tried, but as of yet to no avail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Tiv, traditionally an egalitarian and rural </p><p>society, were historically under the leadership of the Jukun </p><p>traditional leader, the Aku Uka.  Because the Tiv were seen </p><p>as settlers by the Jukun, and because of the conflicts </p><p>between them which begun in the 1950s as Nigeria neared </p><p>independence, the Jukun resisted allowing the Tiv to be part </p><p>of the Wukari (Taraba State) Traditional Council. Implying </p><p>Jukun complicity, Are stated that a number of Tiv village </p><p>heads had recently been killed, because village heads are </p><p>automatically part of the Council.  In 1947, the British </p><p>created the Tiv Council and the traditional/spiritual leader </p><p>position of Tor Tiv.  The Jukun also objected to the Tiv </p><p>being part of the Wukari Council because of Tiv allegiance to </p><p>the Tor Tiv.  Finally, the Jukun (and many Nigerians in </p><p>general) believed that the Tiv were expansionists, taking </p><p>over land and power as they fanned out to take new land for </p><p>agriculture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Are, a political solution would have to </p><p>be found.  However, until the two sides could control the </p><p>youth, and make concessions to each other, conflict would </p><p>continue, despite everyone\'s best efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: Are had a sound historical reading of the </p><p>conflict, and his assessment of the need for political </p><p>concessions from both sides is absolutely correct.  The </p><p>Tiv-Jukun conflict, with periodic explosions, has been </p><p>simmering in the Middle Belt for about 50 years, and will </p><p>continue to burn until a serious effort is made to resolve </p><p>the many issues.  At the Operation Focus Relief graduation in </p><p>Serti (Taraba State) on December 12, the Taraba State Deputy </p><p>Governor Alhaji Danboyi told the Ambassador that the Tiv </p><p>could have land and that the Jukun are willing to live </p><p>together with them, but would never allow the Tiv to be part </p><p>of Jukun traditional and political institutions.  Until this </p><p>type of position softens, the conflict likely will go on. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
