<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PGOV, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMERS CHARGED WITH CRIME OF FARMING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  On July 4-5, 15 Chiredzi-area commercial sugar </p><p>farmers were charged with violating section 8 of the Land </p><p>Acquisition Act by continuing to farm past the </p><p>government-mandated deadline for ceasing commercial farming </p><p>activity.  As of May 10, 2002 all farmers who fail to stop </p><p>occupying, holding, or using land 45 days after the original </p><p>section 8 notification were subject to criminal penalities. </p><p>This legislation is retroactive to all previous section 8 </p><p>acquisition orders, thereby making any occupation or use of </p><p>land after June 24 a criminal offense.  The farmers were </p><p>charged with obstructing the government,s land resettlement </p><p>program even though they had adhered to the government,s </p><p>guidelines regarding farm-size ,and had formally applied for </p><p>an extension of their section 8 orders in advance of the </p><p>deadline.  It is unclear why these 15 were singled out for </p><p>prosecution because all of the 52 small-scale commercial </p><p>farmers in Chiredzi have followed the same process to both </p><p>avoid contravening  the Land Acquisition Act, and to continue </p><p>to pursue their livelihoods.     End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. On July 9, Poloff and Econoff met with David Hasluck, </p><p>Director of the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) to discuss the </p><p>charges brought against the fifteen independent sugar cane </p><p>farmers on July 4 and 5 for continuing to tend to their crops </p><p>subsequent to the June 24 deadline.  Hasluck believes that </p><p>someone resettled under the fast track program probably </p><p>raised the complaint against the farmers,thereby staking a </p><p>claim on the cane growing on the farms.  Hasluck\'s feeling </p><p>was that this -- the first such filing of official charges </p><p>under the Land Acqusition Act --  was a test case, and that </p><p>if the farmers lost, this would signal even more chaos at a </p><p>time when few crops are being grown and widespread famine is </p><p>looming. </p><p> </p><p>3. The farmers were charged with violating the government\'s </p><p>resettlement program even though their farms are within the </p><p>maximum farm size regulations promulgated by Minister of </p><p>Lands Joseph Made.  Although the regulation has not been </p><p>formally enshrined within the Land Act, the 15 farmers were </p><p>under the impression that as long as they complied with this </p><p>guideline they would be allowed to retain their holdings and </p><p>continue to farm.  The fact that the farmers have been </p><p>charged anyway makes it increasingly unclear how commercial </p><p>farmers can legally retain any portion of their holdings. The </p><p>Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Ministry has </p><p>announced a bevy of (sometimes contradictory) guidelines </p><p>relating to the resettlement program, and the situation on </p><p>the ground varies significantly from area to area.  Hasluck </p><p>commented that, often, the amount of land each farmer is </p><p>allowed to retain depends on the individual proclivities of, </p><p>as well as the farmer\'s relationship with, the local land </p><p>committees.   The disconnect between the messages emanating </p><p>from Harare and the situation on the ground leaves commercial </p><p>farmers in the untenable situation of not knowing which </p><p>regulations to comply with to avoid contravening the Land </p><p>Act.  Essentially, the lack of transparency within the </p><p>resettlement process means that even if these commercial </p><p>farmers adhere to the most recent "rules" of the land reform </p><p>program they have very little legal recourse because the GOZ </p><p>continually moves the goalposts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Hasluck noted that all 52 of the small scale sugarcane </p><p>growers in  Chiredzi submitted formal requests for extension </p><p>of their section 8 acquisition orders to Minister Made </p><p>because they still had crops in the ground that needed to be </p><p>harvested.  It is therefore unclear why the 15 farmers were </p><p>selected for prosecution,and not any of the other 37 </p><p>independent cane growers.  This is only the latest example of </p><p>widespread arbitrariness in the implementation of the GOZ\'s </p><p>resettlement program. </p><p>5. Hasluck told the story of a Chegutu commercial farmer who </p><p>applied to Minister Made,s office for an extension of his </p><p>section 8 orders.  The farmer copied his request to the local </p><p>land committee and then approached this body to follow-up. </p><p>Although the local committee informed the farmer that he was </p><p>free to continue his operations, halfway into the growing </p><p>season, he received a letter on behalf of Minister Made </p><p>informing him that there were to be absolutely no extensions </p><p>of section 8 orders, and that the local land committees did </p><p>not have the authority to grant waivers.  In many ways the </p><p>Chegutu farmer,s predicament is analogous to the situation </p><p>faced by the 15 Chiredzi commercial farmers and, indeed, </p><p>commercial farmers throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6. We agree with Hasluck\'s assesment that this will be an </p><p>important test case of the GOZ\'s land reform program.  A </p><p>successful prosecution will embolden the GOZ to pursue </p><p>charges against all commercial farmers who have not stopped </p><p>farming, and will discourage any remaining commercial farmers </p><p>from continuing their operations.  This will exacerbate the </p><p>already dramatic food shortage, as newly resettled farmers </p><p>won\'t come close to filling the gap left by the commercial </p><p>producers.  The Chegutu example suggests that Minister Made </p><p>is uninterested in compromise, despite the fact that half the </p><p>population will soon require food assistance.  August 9 now </p><p>looms as a crucial date, as that is the GOZ\'s deadline for </p><p>all commercial farmers to be off properties that have been </p><p>listed. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
