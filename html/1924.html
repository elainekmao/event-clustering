(C) SUMMARY: ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS DESCRIBED TO </p><p>STAFFDEL REES THE FEBRUARY/MARCH UNREST IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE PEOPLE SEEKING </p><p>REFUGE IN CAMBODIA, NOTED GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO SOLVE </p><p>ETHNIC PROBLEMS, AND DISMISSED REPORTS OF COERCIVE </p><p>FAMILY PLANNING METHODS AND FORCED STERILIZATIONS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CAUSES OF THE UNREST </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) JOSEPH REES (COUNSEL TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS) AND BRIAN GUNDERSON (CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF TO HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER), ALONG WITH CONGENOFFS, </p><p>MET AUGUST 13 AT CONGEN WITH SEVEN ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>STUDENTS FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS CURRENTLY ENROLLED </p><p>AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN HCMC.  THE STUDENTS </p><p>COMPRISED THREE MEMBERS OF THE KQHO ETHNIC GROUP FROM </p><p>LAM DONG PROVINCE, TWO MEMBERS OF THE LACH ETHNIC GROUP </p><p>FROM LAM DONG PROVINCE, ONE MEMBER OF THE EDE ETHNIC </p><p>GROUP FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE, AND ONE MEMBER OF THE GIA </p><p>RAI ETHNIC GROUP FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>TWO STUDENTS FROM DAK LAK AND GIA LAI PROVINCES DID </p><p>MOST OF THE TALKING, ALL THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE CONVERSATION.  (NOTE: THE STUDENT </p><p>FROM DAK LAK SAID HE HAD ARRIVED IN HCMC FROM BUON ME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02152  01 OF 04  310909Z </p><p>THUOT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>THE STAFFDEL MEETING.  ANOTHER STUDENT AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES MENTIONED </p><p>THAT A PROGRAM OF THE FORD FOUNDATION WAS FUNDING HIS </p><p>EDUCATION.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) REES BEGAN THE MEETING BY INQUIRING INTO THE </p><p>CAUSES OF THE FEBRUARY/MARCH UNREST THAT TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>DAK LAK AND GIA LAI PROVINCES.  THE STUDENTS ALL AGREED </p><p>THAT THE MAIN REASON FOR THE UNREST WERE THE ISSUES OF </p><p>MIGRATION AND CLAIMS TO LAND.  THEY CLAIMED THAT ETHNIC </p><p>VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE HAD QAPPROPRIATEDQ THOUSANDS OF </p><p>HECTARES OF LAND THAT QBELONGEDQ TO THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE AREA FOR GENERATIONS. </p><p>ONE STUDENT EXPLAINED THAT ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE </p><p>PRACTICE SHIFTING AGRICULTURE, CULTIVATING LAND IN ONE </p><p>SECTION OF FOREST WHILE LEAVING OTHER SECTIONS FALLOW </p><p>FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO REJUVENATE THE SOIL.  MIGRANTS </p><p>TAKE LAND THAT THEY THINK IS ABANDONED OR UNOCCUPIED </p><p>WHEN IN REALITY IT IS CULTIVATED LAND CURRENTLY FALLOW, </p><p>HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ONE STUDENT COMMENTED THAT WHEN THE CHILDREN OF </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE GET MARRIED, THEIR APPLICATION </p><p>TO BUILD A HOME OR TO CULTIVATE LAND IS A COMPLEX </p><p>PROCEDURE.  IN CONTRAST, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ENCOURAGES MIGRATION FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE </p><p>PROCEDURE FOR MIGRANTS TO BUILD AND CULTIVATE IS </p><p>SIMPLIFIED, HE CLAIMED.  ANOTHER STUDENT SAID THAT AS </p><p>MORE MIGRANTS SETTLE IN THE AREA, THERE IS MORE CONTACT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02152  01 OF 04  310909Z </p><p>BETWEEN THEM AND THE MINORITIES, AND ETHNIC TENSION IS </p><p>INEVITABLE.  THE STUDENT SAID THE ETHNIC VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH MIGRANTS SOMETIMES DUMP THEIR GARBAGE IN MINORITY </p><p>AREAS, AND THIS LEADS TO MANY QUARRELS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) TWO OF THE STUDENTS STATED THAT JUST PRIOR TO </p><p>THE DEMONSTRATIONS THAT BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 2, A NUMBER </p><p>OF FIGHTS OCCURRED BETWEEN MIGRANTS AND ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PEOPLE.  ONE STUDENT SAID THAT IN PHU BO DISTRICT OF </p><p>GIA LAI PROVINCE, A QUARREL BETWEEN A MIGRANT HOUSEHOLD </p><p>AND A MINORITY FAMILY OVER LAND QUICKLY DEVELOPED INTO </p><p>A NEIGHBORHOOD BRAWL IN WHICH SEVERAL PEOPLE USED </p><p>KNIVES AND CLUBS.  THE POLICE INTERVENED, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE STUDENT, BUT USED ELECTRIC PRODS AGAINST THE </p><p>MINORITY PEOPLE AND APPEARED TO BE PROTECTING THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE KINH.  ANOTHER STUDENT SAID THAT IN CHU SE </p><p>DISTRICT OF GIA LAI PROVINCE JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE </p><p>FEBRUARY 2, A FIGHT HAD BROKEN OUT BETWEEN DOZENS OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS AND ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE </p><p>THAT RESULTED IN MANY INJURIES SUCH AS BROKEN RIBS. </p><p>(NOTE: CHU SE DISTRICT APPARENTLY REMAINS VERY TENSE. </p><p>IT IS THE DISTRICT TO WHICH PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO KEEP AMBASSADOR PETERSON FROM TRAVELING IN </p><p>JULY.  SEE REFTEL.) </p><p> </p><p>BUON ME THUOT DEMONSTRATIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ACCORDING TO A STUDENT FROM BUON ME THUOT, UP TO </p><p>1000 ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE DEMONSTRATED IN THAT TOWN </p><p>IN DAK LAK PROVINCE ON FEBRUARY 3.  HE SAID THE LEADERS </p><p>OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS USED LOUDSPEAKERS TO VOICE THEIR </p><p>DEMANDS, WHICH INCLUDED THE RETURN OF ALL CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS LAND TO THE ETHNIC MINORITIES, BETTER </p><p>EDUCATION FOR MINORITY PEOPLE, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. </p><p>THE STUDENT ALSO NOTED THAT MANY DEMONSTRATORS CALLED </p><p>FOR RECOGNITION OF AN INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE WITH KOK </p><p>KQSOR AS ITS PRESIDENT.  (NOTE: SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, KOK KQSOR, WHO LIVES IN SOUTH CAROLINA, </p><p>PROCLAIMED HIMSELF PRESIDENT-IN-EXILE OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>DEGA STATE, ENCOMPASSING ALL OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>HE AND HIS CABINET-IN-EXILE REPORTEDLY PLAYED AN </p><p>INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN PLANNING THE DEMONSTRATIONS ALONG </p><p>WITH ORGANIZERS RESIDENT IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>DEGA IS A TERM USED TO DENOTE THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>AREA AND THE MINORITY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.  SEE </p><p>REFTEL.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE SAME STUDENT SAID THE DEMONSTRATORS HAD </p><p>CONGREGATED IN THE CENTER OF TOWN, BUT ARMORED MILITARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02152  02 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>VEHICLES PREVENTED THEM FROM REACHING THE PEOPLEQS </p><p>COMMITTEE BUILDING (TOWN HALL).  HE ADDED THAT OTHER </p><p>ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES ENCIRCLED THE DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>AND THAT SOLDIERS PREVENTED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE FROM </p><p>JOINING THE CROWD.  AT ONE POINT, A FIRE ENGINE BLASTED </p><p>WATER CANONS AT THE DEMONSTRATORS.  IN RESPONSE, HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THE DEMONSTRATORS THREW STONES AT THE </p><p>FIRE ENGINE AND AT THE MILITARY VEHICLES, WHILE SOME </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS FOUGHT WITH POLICE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>OPERATORS OF THE FIRE ENGINE FLED UNDER A VOLLEY OF </p><p>STONES.  AFTER THE SITUATION CALMED, A REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>FROM THE PEOPLEQS COMMITTEE CAME OUT AND MET WITH THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE DEMONSTRATORS.  THE PEOPLEQS COMMITTEE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES PROMISED TO CONSIDER THE DEMONSTRATORSQ </p><p>DEMANDS.  BY THE AFTERNOON, THE DEMONSTRATORS AGREED TO </p><p>GO HOME, AND THE PEOPLEQS COMMITTEE AGREED TO PROVIDE </p><p>VEHICLES TO TAKE THEM HOME, ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT </p><p>WHO WAS NOT AN EYEWITNESS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) SEVERAL STUDENTS SAID THAT AFTER THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS OF FEBRUARY 2 IN PLEI KU IN GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE AND FEBRUARY 3 IN BUON ME THUOT, OTHER </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS OCCURRED IN SMALLER TOWNS OF THE TWO </p><p>PROVINCES IN THE SUCCEEDING WEEKS.  THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT SENT IN LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITARY TROOPS TO </p><p>GIA LAI PROVINCE, ACCORDING TO THESE STUDENTS.  IN DAK </p><p>LAK PROVINCE, TROOPS WENT ONLY TO EA SUP AND BUON DON </p><p>DISTRICTS, THEY CLAIMED.  TWO STUDENTS STATED THAT THEY </p><p>HAD SEEN A HELICOPTER ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, BUT DID </p><p>NOT KNOW IF IT WAS THE SAME HELICOPTER.  THEY ALSO SAID </p><p>THEY SAW TANKS IN THE AREA IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02152  02 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>THESE STUDENTS ALL STATED THAT MOST OF THE UNIFORMED </p><p>SECURITY FORCES HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR BASES, BUT A FEW </p><p>REMAIN.  A STUDENT FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID A SMALL </p><p>CONTINGENT OF ABOUT 30 SOLDIERS STILL PATROLLED HIS </p><p>HOME DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERN FOR PERSONS WHO FLED TO CAMBODIA </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ONE STUDENT SAID MOST OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS HAD FLED TO CAMBODIA, BUT SOME HAD BEEN </p><p>QARRESTEDQ IN VIETNAM.  HE SAID HE HEARD AN UNKNOWN </p><p>NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE DETAINED IN CAMBODIA AND TURNED </p><p>OVER BY CAMBODIAN POLICE TO VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES. </p><p>ALL THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>HAD FLED TO CAMBODIA AND ASKED ABOUT THEIR CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION.  REES TOLD THEM THAT 38 PERSONS HAD BEEN </p><p>RESETTLED TO THE U.S., AND THAT ANOTHER 360 WERE UNDER </p><p>UNHCR PROTECTION IN CAMBODIA.  HE ADDED THAT ABOUT 70 </p><p>PERSONS WHO HAD GONE TO CAMBODIA REPORTEDLY HAD </p><p>RETURNED TO VIETNAM.  HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE 360 </p><p>STILL IN CAMBODIA HAVE STATED THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO TO </p><p>THE U.S.  INSTEAD, THEY WISH TO RETURN TO VIETNAM, BUT </p><p>ONLY AFTER THE LAND AND MIGRATION PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. </p><p>THE STUDENTS WERE DISMAYED THAT SOME PERSONS MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN RETURNED TO VIETNAM.  WHEN ASKED WHAT THEY THOUGHT </p><p>BEST FOR THOSE REFUGEES STILL IN CAMBODIA, THE STUDENTS </p><p>TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES AND THEN SAID THEY THOUGHT IT </p><p>BEST FOR THEM TO STAY IN CAMBODIA UNDER UNHCR </p><p>PROTECTION UNTIL CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT THEY COULD </p><p>RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISAL. </p><p> </p><p>PROTESTANT PROBLEMS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ALL THE STUDENTS AGREED THAT LAND AND MIGRATION </p><p>WERE THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE ETHNIC UNREST.  SOME OF </p><p>THEM NOTED FURTHER, HOWEVER, THAT MANY ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PEOPLE BELONG TO PROTESTANT CONGREGATIONS, AND THAT THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO RESULTED FROM THE VENTING OF PENT- </p><p>UP FRUSTRATIONS OVER HARASSMENT OF ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PROTESTANTS BY LOCAL OFFICIALS OVER THE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ONE STUDENT SAID FRIENDS HAD TOLD HIM THAT IN </p><p>KRONG PA DISTRICT OF GIA LAI PROVINCE, AUTHORITIES </p><p>RECENTLY DEMANDED SEVERAL ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT </p><p>BELIEVERS RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH.  WHEN THEY REFUSED, </p><p>THEY WERE MADE TO PAY FINES (WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM </p><p>OF MONEY OR LIVESTOCK).  ONE OF THE STUDENTS SAID HE </p><p>HAD BEEN DENIED A JOB IN PLEI KU BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02152  03 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>CROSS OUT QTIN LANHQ (PROTESTANT) ON HIS JOB </p><p>APPLICATION FORM.  SEVERAL STUDENTS SAID THEY HAD HEARD </p><p>THAT IN APRIL, A COFFEE SHOP OWNER IN DAM RONG VILLAGE, </p><p>LAC DUONG DISTRICT IN LAM DONG PROVINCE WAS PLAYING A </p><p>VIDEO OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN HER SHOP WHEN </p><p>POLICE CAME AND TOLD HER TO TURN IT OFF.  TEN OR TWELVE </p><p>CUSTOMERS WHO WERE IN THE SHOP ARGUED WITH THE </p><p>POLICEMAN WHO THEN WENT AWAY.  BUT 30 MINUTES LATER, </p><p>THE SHOP CAUGHT FIRE AND BURNED TO THE GROUND.  THE </p><p>STUDENTS CLAIMED THAT WHEN REPORTERS FROM THE DALAT </p><p>CITY NEWSPAPER CAME TO THE VILLAGE INQUIRING ABOUT THE </p><p>INCIDENT, THE POLICE TOLD THEM THAT THE COFFEE SHOP </p><p>OWNER HAD BEEN SHOWING A PORNOGRAPHIC FILM. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE STUDENTS ALL AGREED THAT ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>CATHOLICS GENERALLY FARED BETTER THAN ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN THE HIGHLAND PROVINCES, BUT IN CERTAIN </p><p>LOCALITIES CATHOLICS, TOO, FACED REPRESSION IN VARYING </p><p>DEGREES.  ONE STUDENT SAID HE WAS AWARE THAT IN LAC </p><p>DUONG DISTRICT IN LAM DONG PROVINCE, THE PRIEST AT THE </p><p>SINGLE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS BEEN REQUESTING PERMISSION </p><p>TO RENOVATE HIS BADLY DILAPIDATED CHURCH SINCE 1989, </p><p>BUT HAS RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHORITIES. </p><p>CATHOLICS IN THIS AREA ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM BAPTISMS </p><p>ONLY ON CHRISTMAS AND EASTER, HE SAID, BUT THIS YEAR, </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE ETHNIC UNREST, EASTER BAPTISMS WERE NOT </p><p>ALLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE STUDENTS FROM LAM DONG PROVINCE SAID IT WAS </p><p>WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THE PRESTIGIOUS HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>BOARDING SCHOOL FOR ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02152  03 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>PROVINCIAL CAPITAL DALAT DOES NOT APPROVE REGISTRATION </p><p>FOR PROTESTANT STUDENTS.  SOME OF THE STUDENTS ADDED </p><p>THAT THEY KNEW OF A 16-YEAR-OLD STUDENT AT THIS </p><p>BOARDING SCHOOL WHO WAS EXPELLED IN MAY WHEN IT BECAME </p><p>KNOWN THAT HIS FATHER HAD ONCE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>FULRO.  (NOTE: FULRO WAS POLITICAL/MILITARY </p><p>ORGANIZATION THAT ESPOUSED AUTONOMY FOR THE INDIGENOUS </p><p>PEOPLES OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS UNTIL ITS FINAL DEMISE </p><p>IN THE EARLY 1990QS.  END NOTE.)  SOME OF THE STUDENTS </p><p>CLAIMED THE REASON PROTESTANTS FACE REPRESSION IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IS BECAUSE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>ASSOCIATE PROTESTANTISM WITH FULRO.  THE STUDENTS </p><p>UNANIMOUSLY DISAGREED WITH THIS VIEW.  THEY AGREED </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PROTESTANT PASTORS </p><p>AND FULRO IN THE PAST, BUT THAT NOWADAYS PROTESTANT </p><p>PASTORS PREACH ONLY RELIGION.  (COMMENT: SEVERAL </p><p>RELIABLE PROTESTANT SOURCES HAVE PAINTED A SOMEWHAT </p><p>DIFFERENT PICTURE ABOUT PROTESTANTISM AND POLITICS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THEY SAY THERE IS A SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN THE MAJORITY OF PASTORS WHO WANT ONLY TO PREACH </p><p>RELIGION AND A VOCAL MINORITY WHO WERE ACTIVE </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF THE FORMER FULRO AND ARE NOW SUPPORTERS </p><p>OF THE DEGA STATE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO FIND SOLUTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) MOST OF THE STUDENTS SAID THEY WERE ENCOURAGED </p><p>THAT THE CENTRAL AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS APPEAR TO </p><p>BE SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS </p><p>OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, A FEW OF </p><p>THEM WERE DISCOURAGED THAT SOME OF THE GOVERNMENTQS </p><p>EFFORTS APPEARED INSINCERE.  ONE STUDENT RECOUNTED THAT </p><p>IN GIA LAI PROVINCE, LOCAL TELEVISION CREWS FILMED </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS DISTRIBUTING MOSQUITO NETS, BAGS </p><p>OF SALT AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN A MINORITY VILLAGE, BUT </p><p>WHEN THE CAMERAS WERE TURNED OFF, THE OFFICIALS </p><p>REQUESTED PAYMENT FOR THE ITEMS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE SEVEN STUDENTS CONCURRED THAT THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE STEP THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN IS TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO CONDUCT </p><p>PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION IN MINORITY LANGUAGES.  THE </p><p>STUDENTS ALL AGREED THAT ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS HAVE </p><p>LAGGED BEHIND EDUCATIONALLY OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE </p><p>CLASSES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN VIETNAMESE Q A NON- </p><p>NATIVE LANGUAGE TO THEM.  (NOTE: THEIR CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH STAFFDEL WAS NONETHELESS IN VIETNAMESE WITH </p><p>ENGLISH INTERPRETATION.  END NOTE.)  THEY APPLAUDED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTQS EFFORTS TO CONDUCT PRIMARY EDUCATION IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02152  04 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>LOCAL LANGUAGES WHILE TEACHING VIETNAMESE AS A SEPARATE </p><p>SUBJECT.  SEVERAL STUDENTS ALSO SAID THERE HAS BEEN A </p><p>CAMPAIGN SINCE FEBRUARY THAT ALL LOCAL OFFICIALS (WHO </p><p>GENERALLY ARE ETHNIC VIETNAMESE KINH SENT TO ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY AREAS) SHOULD LEARN THE LANGUAGES OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK.  THIS HAS LED TO SOME </p><p>JOB CREATION FOR MINORITY PEOPLE BEING HIRED AS </p><p>LANGUAGE TEACHERS.  IN APRIL, LAM DONG PROVINCE HIRED </p><p>SEVERAL MINORITY PEOPLE TO TEACH MINORITY LANGUAGES TO </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL POLICE, ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) SEVERAL STUDENTS ADDED THAT, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>LANGUAGE PROGRAMS, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS SENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES INTO MINORITY COMMUNITIES TO LISTEN TO </p><p>GRIEVANCES AND CALM PEOPLE DOWN.  THESE STUDENTS ALSO </p><p>SAID THEY NOTICED A REAL EFFORT ON THE PART OF </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS TO IDENTIFY AND FIND EMPLOYMENT </p><p>FOR ETHNIC MINORITY UNIVERSITY GRADUATES.  (TWO OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS REMARKED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY COMPLETED THEIR </p><p>OWN UNIVERSITY COURSES BUT CONTINUED TO TAKE CLASSES </p><p>BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, </p><p>HOWEVER.) </p><p> </p><p>THE STUDENTS SAY NO FORCED STERILIZATIONS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) REESQS FINAL QUESTION WAS ABOUT CONTINUING </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS ARE MADE TO UNDERGO ABORTIONS OR </p><p>STERILIZATIONS AGAINST THEIR WILL.  THE STUDENTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02152  04 OF 04  310910Z </p><p>(INCLUDING ONE FEMALE STUDENT) REPLIED UNANIMOUSLY THAT </p><p>THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE BEING SUBJECTED TO </p><p>FORCED ABORTION OR STERILIZATION.  THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD A FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM THAT </p><p>ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO USE IUDQS OR OTHER METHODS OF </p><p>BIRTH CONTROL, BUT THE STUDENTS DID NOT BELIEVE ANY </p><p>COERCION WAS INVOLVED.  IN A DISCUSSION AMONG </p><p>THEMSELVES, ONE STUDENT SAID THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN </p><p>ISOLATED INCIDENTS IN THE PAST, BUT THE OTHERS </p><p>DISAGREED. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) THE STAFFDEL DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CLEAR THIS MESSAGE BEFORE DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
