Under headline "State must explain policy flip- </p><p>      flop on GM food" the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>      News" dedicated its September 10 editorial to </p><p>      challenging the government to explain President </p><p>      Mugabe\'s ruling that Zimbabwe will accept food aid </p><p>      that may contain biotech products.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The government must explain its sudden U-turn on </p><p>      genetically modified (GM) maize. . .  State media </p><p>      reports that James Morris, the director of the World </p><p>      Food Program (WFP), was rebuffed by President Mugabe. </p><p>      . .when he first raised the issue on the sidelines of </p><p>      the Earth Summit in Johannesburg.  Morris persisted </p><p>      and came out to Harare.  Soon after meeting Mugabe, </p><p>      the government announced the WFP planned to ship </p><p>      600,000 tons of maize, some of it GM, into the </p><p>      country.  So what was all the fuss about?  The </p><p>      government\'s only face-saver was that the food will be </p><p>      `quarantined,\' whatever that means.  The government </p><p>      must explain what it knows now about GM food - which </p><p>      it didn\'t know last week - the precautions people must </p><p>      take before consumption and the reason for this </p><p>      radical policy shift." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
