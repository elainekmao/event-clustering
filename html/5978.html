<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: QUOTA GUARANTEES WOMEN SIX SEATS IN PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) A royal decree issued on February 19 formalized a </p><p>quota system that guarantees six seats for women in the next </p><p>Parliament.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW QUOTA GUARANTEES FEMALE PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The GOJ amended the election law on February 19 to </p><p>include a new quota that guarantees six seats for women in </p><p>the next Parliamentary elections.  The six seats will be </p><p>added to the current 104 seats, bringing the total number of </p><p>seats available in the next Parliamentary elections to 110. </p><p>The next elections are expected to be held sometime this </p><p>summer. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The quota seats will be distributed nationally to the </p><p>six candidates who receive the highest percentage of votes in </p><p>their respective districts.  (For example, if a woman </p><p>candidate in Kerak wins 2.5 percent of the vote in that </p><p>district, she would place ahead of a woman candidate in Amman </p><p>who won 2.3 percent of her district\'s vote.)  If a woman </p><p>candidate wins the most votes in her district, she wins the </p><p>seat outright and it is not counted against the quota.  As in </p><p>the past, eligible women will be able to run for the </p><p>Circassian and Christian quota seats as well. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The quota has inspired a flurry of pre-election </p><p>activity in women\'s groups.  Over fifty female candidates </p><p>have expressed an interest in running as candidates in the </p><p>next elections.  However, several contacts predict the number </p><p>will decrease when candidates have to pay the 500 JD (roughly </p><p>$700) campaign fee. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>SOME WOMEN EXPECT IAF AND GOVERNORATES TO BENEFIT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Poloff recently discussed the quota issue with several </p><p>prominent women who represent the socially active liberal </p><p>elite, two of whom will likely be running in the next </p><p>election.  All opined that if the IAF decides to participate </p><p>in the next election, "they will win all six quota seats." </p><p>Salwa Nasser-Mahmoud, the NGO coordinator for the Jordanian </p><p>National Commission for Women, said the IAF was "too </p><p>well-organized, too well-funded" to be defeated.  (Salwa </p><p>commented that campaign expenses can run up to $40,000 with </p><p>candidates absorbing much of the costs.)  Contacts feared </p><p>that the IAF would not represent the needs of liberal women </p><p>if it won the quota seats.  One contact told Poloff, "if the </p><p>IAF wins the quota seats, it would erase all of our gains." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The "one man, one vote" electoral system also poses </p><p>challenges for the candidates.  Few women will have the name </p><p>recognition or tribal support to lure voters away from </p><p>established candidates who have the endorsement of tribal </p><p>leaders.  Contacts cited voter apathy as another hurdle. </p><p>"Some view election day as a vacation day--they go out to </p><p>picnic or go to Petra, instead of to the polls."  Voter </p><p>apathy also favors the IAF candidates, whose supporters tend </p><p>to vote in higher percentages. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Most contacts agreed that the quota benefits women </p><p>running in smaller governorates.  One contact running in the </p><p>Balqa district said, "it is more difficult to receive a </p><p>higher percent of the votes in my district, with 20,000 </p><p>constituents, than in Tafileh, which only has 2,000 </p><p>constituents."  Women are also unlikely to be elected in </p><p>Amman.  Several districts in Amman will have multiple women </p><p>candidates, who will likely split the vote.  Voting districts </p><p>in Amman are among the largest in Jordan--some with over </p><p>200,000 constituents, making it more difficult for a woman to </p><p>receive a high percentage of the votes.  Contacts predict </p><p>that the smaller governorates--including Tafileh, Mafraq, </p><p>Kerak, and Irbid--will most likely win the quota seats. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>LACK OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATION HURTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Although there are several NGOs in Jordan focused on </p><p>women\'s issues, no one organization has emerged to coordinate </p><p>a general strategy for women candidates in the elections. </p><p>(Post PA section has worked closely with Princess Basma\'s </p><p>Hashemite Foundation and the National Commission for Women in </p><p>an ongoing series of campaign workshops for women candidates, </p><p>but the National Commission for Women has shown little </p><p>initiative as a general coordinator, in part because some of </p><p>the potential organizers show great reluctance to offer help </p><p>to women outside their own social circles.)  Contacts </p><p>complain that the lack of such an organization will undermine </p><p>their collective interests.  For example, at least five </p><p>liberal women plan to run in the third district of Amman, </p><p>ensuring that none will likely win a quota seat.  Prominent </p><p>women have also expressed the fear that "unqualified" women </p><p>will run, win, perform poorly in Parliament, and weaken </p><p>future support for women\'s participation in politics.  "We </p><p>are concerned that women who are not qualified nor prepared </p><p>will run for the wrong reasons...and if they win, will not </p><p>represent us well." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>ONE STRATEGY: COURT THE CHRISTIANS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) At least two women running in districts with large </p><p>percentages of Christians told Poloff that they would be </p><p>campaigning for the Christian vote.  One woman running in </p><p>Balqa/Salt area said that she has no chance of obtaining the </p><p>tribal vote in her district, but "Christians may vote for a </p><p>moderate Muslim woman," who would more likely serve their </p><p>interests than a tribal or IAF candidate.  However, in most </p><p>heavily Christian districts, women would be competing with </p><p>Christian quota seats (currently there are nine seats </p><p>reserved for Christians). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Most women Poloff contacted believe this coming </p><p>election is a make or break event for women\'s political </p><p>participation in Jordan.  Although many women are energized </p><p>by this opportunity, they lack the infrastructure, and so </p><p>far, the leadership to compete effectively with the IAF and </p><p>tribal loyalties.  To this end, Post PA is organizing a </p><p>fellowship campaign for April, circumstances permitting and </p><p>will assist in the set-up and funding of a campaign phone </p><p>center, managed by the Hashemite Fund, to be used jointly by </p><p>women candidates.  Post is also involved in arranging </p><p>post-election training and exchanging opportunities for the </p><p>six (or more) successful women candidates.  We plan to speak </p><p>with a broad spectrum of women candidates in the run-up to </p><p>the election. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
