From March 4-8, (2003) USAID/AFR/SA Officer </p><p>(AIDOff) MacNairn conducted three field trips to assess </p><p>the delivery and impact of humanitarian assistance in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Events covered for these field trips </p><p>included a seed fair, a food distribution (also </p><p>attended by DCM Whitehead), and an interview with a </p><p>commercial farm worker.  The seed fair and food </p><p>distribution proceeded smoothly, and the commercial </p><p>farm worker provided first-hand support for the </p><p>widespread allegations of corruption and political </p><p>manipulation of government food distributions.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>RUDAWIRO SEED FAIR </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  On March 4, AIDOff, accompanied by Catholic Relief </p><p>Services\' (CRS) staff, attended a seed fair in Rudawiro </p><p>business center, Chigwarada Ward, UMP District in </p><p>Mashonaland East Province.  The seed </p><p>fair voucher system is funded by USAID and the </p><p>Department for International Development-UK (DFID), and </p><p>provides beneficiaries in communal farming areas with </p><p>Z$6400 (about US$4.50 equivalent) worth of vouchers to </p><p>purchase seeds.  In this particular case, vegetable </p><p>seeds were available (e.g., rape, cabbage, cucumber, </p><p>tomato, squash, carrot, bean, onion, spinach, etc.), as </p><p>the planting season for cereals has already passed. </p><p>This seed fair targeted 1200 beneficiaries within the </p><p>zone, covering roughly 80-90% of the total population </p><p>for the area.  Beneficiary selection criteria for this </p><p>scheme included widows, child-headed households and </p><p>orphans, those chronically-ill, handicapped, or </p><p>otherwise destitute. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Pannar and Prime were the two seed companies </p><p>providing the seeds at this fair.  Beneficiaries chose </p><p>which seeds they wanted, based on price and their </p><p>Z$6400 budget, and the seed companies collected the </p><p>vouchers.  The seed companies then present these </p><p>vouchers for payment to CRS\' partner NGO, in this case </p><p>Community Technology Development Trust (CTDT).  CTDT </p><p>selects and registers beneficiaries based on set </p><p>criteria, organizes the seed fairs, prints the voucher </p><p>coupons, and provides other logistical support.  CRS\' </p><p>agriculture project manager provides technical </p><p>assistance and other support for the activity.  The </p><p>seed fairs are a novel approach to food security in </p><p>that distributed seeds help to avoid the dependence </p><p>that direct food aid creates, the seed distributions </p><p>empower beneficiaries by allowing them to choose what </p><p>they want to grow, and the vegetables contribute to a </p><p>better-balanced, more nutritious diet, particularly </p><p>important for those suffering from debilitating chronic </p><p>illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Training is provided by CRS and its partner NGO, </p><p>CTDT, to allow beneficiaries to save seeds from grown </p><p>vegetables for the next planting cycle.  For some </p><p>vegetables it is much easier to save seeds, i.e., </p><p>butternut squash and tomatoes, as opposed to cabbage </p><p>and rape, where it is usually easier to provide seeds </p><p>on a continual basis.  Effective saving of seeds </p><p>through multiple growing cycles contributes to the </p><p>sustainability of the intervention.  At this point, CRS </p><p>has focused its efforts on emergency relief </p><p>interventions with CTDT.  CRS and CTDT expect that </p><p>future training for seed fair beneficiaries will make </p><p>them better able to implement seed replication </p><p>techniques, as all stakeholders prepare for the 2003/4 </p><p>growing season. </p><p> </p><p>5.  It is expected that beneficiaries will consume </p><p>roughly sixty percent of vegetables grown, and sell the </p><p>remaining forty percent.  CTDT will perform follow-up </p><p>visits to ascertain whether these above proportions are </p><p>generally correct, whether beneficiaries have planted </p><p>their purchased seeds, and productivity levels for </p><p>individual gardens.  The area targeted for this seed </p><p>fair should be one of the more productive areas for </p><p>Mashonaland East, as numerous perennial streams run </p><p>through that part of the province, and water sources </p><p>should remain readily available after the rainy season </p><p>ends in April. </p><p> </p><p>6.  UMP District is served by World Vision with </p><p>international food aid from the World Food Program </p><p>(WFP), and the governmental Grain Marketing Board (GMB) </p><p>for other/commercial food supplies.  World Vision is </p><p>expected to target two-thirds of the district </p><p>population for food aid in March 2003.  Rudawiro </p><p>residents reported that GMB deliveries for the past 6 </p><p>months have been erratic.  Respondents </p><p>also reported that maize meal was being sold at the </p><p>official price of Z$560/50 kgs., but that only very </p><p>small quantities were available.  Residents stated that </p><p>the recent doubling of the gas price (officially </p><p>Z$150/liter) meant that round trip costs by bus from </p><p>Rudawiro to Murehwa (Z$2000) and Harare (Z$4400) had </p><p>become onerously expensive. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SANYATI FOOD DISTRIBUTION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On March 6, AIDOff accompanied Embassy DCM </p><p>Whitehead, observed a CRS food distribution in Sanyati </p><p>town in Kadoma District.  1219 families received </p><p>rations for this general distribution.  This represents </p><p>100% coverage for this initial CRS food distribution in </p><p>this area (as opposed to 75% coverage in most other </p><p>program areas).  Beneficiaries patiently organized </p><p>themselves in small groups of 50 or so people, based on </p><p>their home areas, and waited for their turn to receive </p><p>the monthly ration of 10kg. bulgur wheat and 1 kg. </p><p>pinto beans.  No oil was available for this </p><p>distribution, and bulgur wheat </p><p>was a new food commodity for beneficiaries.  CRS </p><p>distributed handouts in English and Shona </p><p>explaining how to cook the bulgur wheat, and </p><p>promised to follow up to determine whether </p><p>beneficiaries were properly cooking the bulgur, </p><p>and whether they liked the commodity. </p><p> </p><p>8. Beneficiaries appeared to be happy upon receiving </p><p>the bulgur wheat.  Initial reports received indicated </p><p>that beneficiaries liked the commodity and did not have </p><p>difficulty cooking the bulgur wheat.  However, follow </p><p>up will be required to determine if this new food </p><p>commodity is truly accepted by the beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Grain Marketing Board (GMB) maize meal deliveries </p><p>at Sanyati, were also reported to be erratic, with </p><p>widely varying amounts reported to be delivered over </p><p>the past several months.  One villager alleged that the </p><p>GMB has reduced deliveries to Sanyati because CRS is </p><p>now distributing food in the area. </p><p> </p><p>10. The primary and secondary schools in Sanyati </p><p>town do not provide meals for students.  The headmaster </p><p>for each respective school reported </p><p>lowered attendance because of the recent food shortages </p><p>- 45% decrease at the primary school </p><p>and 30% at the secondary school.  Both headmasters also </p><p>expected attendance to increase in the coming week, </p><p>once these initial food distributions had </p><p>been completed. </p><p> </p><p>11. GOZ officials turned out in force for this </p><p>distribution, likely due to the DCM\'s presence </p><p>and the fact that this was the first CRS </p><p>distribution for this area.  GOZ officials present </p><p>for the distribution included the local Kadoma </p><p>West Member of Parliament (ZANU-PF), the District </p><p>Administrator, the Deputy District Administrator, </p><p>representatives from the Ministries of Education </p><p>and Social Welfare, at least 8 policemen, and the </p><p>two headmasters.  NOTE: This was in contrast to the </p><p>Rudawiro seed fair where no local government officials </p><p>were visible.  End Note.  The distribution </p><p>appeared well-organized and efficiently run, </p><p>with no overt political posturing evident during </p><p>our visit.  The MP invited the DCM to a virginity </p><p>certification ceremony to take place in his district in </p><p>the following week.  The DCM respectfully declined the </p><p>invitation </p><p> </p><p>12. The Sanyati area borders the Munyati River, </p><p>and cotton is the predominant crop in this </p><p>lowveld area.  The maize harvest for this area </p><p>is expected to be about 40% of normal. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FARM WORKER INTERVIEW </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  A credible commercial farm worker was </p><p>interviewed on March 8 in Manicaland Province. </p><p>The main points from this conversation include: </p><p>- GMB maize is widely being sold at inflated </p><p>prices of Z$2000/20 kgs., rather than the </p><p>official Z$560/50 kgs. Price. </p><p>- many people know that maize meal is being sold </p><p>at inflated prices on the black market, but individuals </p><p>are unwilling to complain, as they </p><p>fear reprisals from local authorities involved </p><p>in the illegal practice. </p><p>- newly-resettled farmers in the area were </p><p>typically coming from outside the province, were </p><p>not from communal areas, and typically had little </p><p>farming experience. </p><p>- newly-resettled farmers were positively favored </p><p>in receiving GMB maize at the official price. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The commercial farm worker relayed a </p><p>further story where a neighboring commercial farm </p><p>was prevented from planting maize at the beginning </p><p>of the rainy season in 2002, because it was </p><p>occupied by war veterans.  The commercial farmer </p><p>then recently attempted to buy GMB maize meal for </p><p>his 75 workers as he had no maize to feed them </p><p>from his farm.  Officials selling the GMB maize </p><p>said that he could only purchase one bag of maize </p><p>meal at the official price for himself, rather </p><p>than the 75 bags that he wanted, as his farm </p><p>workers were perceived to be MDC supporters, and </p><p>thus did not `qualify\' for GMB maize at the </p><p>official price. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The commercial farm worker also commented that the </p><p>national youth service centers were contributing to the </p><p>spread of AIDS, because little education or controls </p><p>were being provided for the trainees. </p><p>Finally, he noted that inflation was destroying </p><p>the purchasing power of the average commercial </p><p>farm worker.  The official minimum wage for </p><p>commercial farm workers is Z$7500/month plus </p><p>benefits, which translates to US$5/month at the </p><p>current parallel market rate.  Many commercial </p><p>farm workers on resettled farms make less than </p><p>the official $7500 wage. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>16.  CRS\' innovative seed fair strategy appears </p><p>to be popular and highly successful, and should </p><p>be encouraged.  Follow-up evaluations should be </p><p>conducted to determine sustainability, and the </p><p>actual percentages of consumption and sales for </p><p>the vegetables grown.  Although the bulgur wheat </p><p>distribution went well, it remains to be seen </p><p>if this new food commodity is truly accepted by </p><p>the beneficiaries.  Follow-up will be required </p><p>here, too.  The farm worker commentary provides </p><p>first-hand corroboration for the widespread allegations </p><p>of corruption and political </p><p>manipulation of government food supplies. </p><p>End Comment.
