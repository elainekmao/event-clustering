<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, PGOV, UK, HR, ICTY, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA USING "UNCOMFORTABLE" BACK-CHANNEL TO </p><p>CONVINCE GOTOVINA TO SURRENDER </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1579 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Patrick S. Moon for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Croatian government is using an unusual </p><p>back-channel in an attempt to create conditions in which </p><p>PIFWC Ante Gotovina would surrender for transfer to ICTY. </p><p>The GoC\'s urgency and unorthodox approach is derived from the </p><p>UK\'s refusal to ratify Croatia\'s Stabilization and </p><p>Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU unless Croatia </p><p>demonstrates its commitment to cooperate with ICTY.  Unless </p><p>the SAA is ratified soon, Croatia will miss a key deadline in </p><p>its application for EU membership.  ICTY is showing some </p><p>flexibility in its approach to the Gotovina case, but the </p><p>likelihood that this particular effort will bring about </p><p>Gotovina\'s surrender is uncertain.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) UK Ambassador in Croatia Nicholas Jarrold has kept us </p><p>closely informed of an unusual GoC back-channel effort to </p><p>broker the surrender of ICTY PIFWC Ante Gotovina.  The key </p><p>players in the effort are: </p><p> </p><p>- Zeljko Bagic, one of President Mesic\'s top National </p><p>Security Advisors (Mesic has been seeking a way for Gotovina </p><p>to "tell his side of the story" before giving himself up - </p><p>ref); </p><p> </p><p>- Ivo Pukanic, editor of the sensationalist newsweekly </p><p>"Nacional," which on June 10 ran Gotovina\'s first interview </p><p>after two years in hiding (in the interview, Gotovina said he </p><p>recognized the authority of the ICTY, widely interpreted as a </p><p>signal he was ready to talk about surrendering); </p><p> </p><p>- Thomas Osorio, ICTY representative in Zagreb; and </p><p> </p><p>- UK Ambassador Nicholas Jarrold, a hesitant participant, but </p><p>evidently selected by the GoC because the UK is the EU </p><p>country Croatia needs most to convince that they are serious </p><p>about transferring Gotovina to the Hague. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On July 30, Pukanic approached Amb. Jarrold (at the </p><p>urging of Bagic) and said that Gotovina offered to make </p><p>himself available in Zagreb for an interview with ICTY </p><p>representatives.  Gotovina was prepared to agree to fly to </p><p>The Hague and surrender five days later.  Pukanic said that </p><p>Gotovina is seeking a scenario which would retain his "honor </p><p>as a Croatian general."  Amb. Jarrold rejected this scheme </p><p>and held firm: Gotovina must go to The Hague -- no detours. </p><p>Nonetheless, Jarrold said that he saw no problem with </p><p>Gotovina making himself "available" to the ICTY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Amb. Jarrold instructed his DCM to brief local ICTY </p><p>representative Osorio, who apparently consulted with The </p><p>Hague and came back with a proposal for Gotovina: Osorio and </p><p>several of his investigators would meet Gotovina in Bosnia </p><p>for a period of hours for an interview, giving Gotovina the </p><p>opportunity to make the statement to investigators that he </p><p>seeks.  SFOR would provide "security" for the meeting, and </p><p>Gotovina would surrender to SFOR afterwards.  Having Gotovina </p><p>surrender in Bosnia would also spare GOC officials all the </p><p>angst related to having to send their "war hero" off to The </p><p>Hague. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Amb. Jarrold told us that he delivered this offer to </p><p>Nacional editor Pukanic on July 31.  Pukanic responded that </p><p>such a meeting was not possible since Gotovina was "5,000 to </p><p>10,000" kilometers away.  Pukanic suggested a meeting in </p><p>Mexico City.  Amb. Jarrold immediately rejected such an </p><p>arrangement pointing out the obvious complications of </p><p>involving Mexican and possibly American authorities. </p><p>Jarrold also reported that UK contacts with del Ponte\'s staff </p><p>in The Hague suggested that she might be backtracking from </p><p>the offer Osorio made here.  He pointed to the difficulties </p><p>in dealing with individuals on her staff and del Ponte\'s poor </p><p>relations with other parts of the Tribunal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Amb. Jarrold said that his involvement has run its </p><p>course, and he is ending his role, with which he was clearly </p><p>uncomfortable.  Jarrold said EC officials told him that for </p><p>Croatia to stay on their desired timeline in the EU </p><p>application process, they need all the ratifications of </p><p>Croatia\'s SAA by late December or early January.  The UK </p><p>would require three months for the Parliament, government and </p><p>Queen to act.  The Dutch are the other holdout, but The Hague </p><p>needs only a week or so to act since the Dutch parliament has </p><p>already approved the SAA; the government is holding the </p><p>ratification pending sufficient GOC action on ICTY issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Unlike the previous interactions with Gotovina, these </p><p>talks have not yet surfaced in the press.  We will have to </p><p>wait until early next week when the next issue of Nacional </p><p>appears to see whether Pukanic will make public his latest </p><p>intermediary services. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The ball is again in Gotovina\'s court with the GOC </p><p>watching anxiously and no doubt praying that Gotovina will </p><p>take up the ICTY\'s offer.  While Gotovina\'s surrender is a </p><p>necessary step for British ratification of the SAA, it will </p><p>not likely be sufficient.  London will probably also want to </p><p>see that the GOC acts appropriately when it receives new </p><p>indictments, rumored for September.  The GOC has said it will </p><p>be responsive and act quickly, but we -- like the British -- </p><p>will want to see that they do so and not merely accept their </p><p>word. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
