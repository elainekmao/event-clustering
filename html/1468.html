<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/29/2010 </p><p>TAGS: CG, PGOV, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT KABILA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(C) (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Swing met with President Kabila </p><p>for an hour at latter\'s Marble Palace Office on December 29. </p><p>In response to concerns expressed about the renewed fighting </p><p>in Katanga and Equateur Provinces, Kabila defended his </p><p>actions as defensive moves in retaliation for Rwandan </p><p>offensives in Katanga and Bemba\'s MLC in Equateur.  A senior </p><p>DRC delegation is presently holding meetings with President </p><p>Chiluba in Lusaka regarding Kabila\'s allegation that Zambia </p><p>may be allowing Rwanda to use its territory to attack </p><p>Lubumbashi.  Kabila said that he looks forward to meeting </p><p>with Congressman Frank Wolf on January 8.  Ambassador urged </p><p>Kabila to appoint a new UN permanent representative without </p><p>further delay.  Septel reports on Kabila\'s discussions with </p><p>Burundian President Buyoya.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Good News.....bad news at year\'s end </p><p>     Ambassador Swing and President Kabila met alone for an </p><p>hour at latter\'s Marble Palace office and home in the Binza </p><p>section of town.  Although showing signs of fatigue, Kabila </p><p>was relaxed and in a good mood. (His unofficial number two </p><p>and relative, Interior Minister of State Gaetan Kakudji, </p><p>waited outside the house during the meeting.)  The Ambassador </p><p>hailed the passage of UNSCR 1332 and the signature of </p><p>disengagement sub-plans, but expressed concern at the renewed </p><p>fighting in Katanga and Equateur and the difficult situation </p><p>this was creating both inside the DRC and in neighboring </p><p>Zambia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) "End of the war perceptible if......" </p><p>     The Ambassador asked whether, notwithstanding these </p><p>latest conflicts, it is conceivable that the end of the Congo </p><p>war might be approaching with the prolongation of MONUC\'s </p><p>mandate and the signature of the disengagement sub-plans. </p><p>Kabila replied affirmatively, saying that the end of the war </p><p>is "perceptible" provided the disengagement sub-plans are </p><p>effectively implemented and MONUC deploys. </p><p>     "Unfortunately", Kabila said, Rwanda has chosen to </p><p>"re-start" the fighting which he found "surprising".  Also, </p><p>JP Bemba and his MLC had decided to take the war further </p><p>south and to capture Befale.  These moves had forced him, </p><p>Kabila, to re-position and activate FAC "aviation".  He had </p><p>also had to reinforce Boende, including moving heavy </p><p>equipment there.  "Bemba must leave Befale", he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Talks with Chiluba about Rwanda </p><p>     The Ambassador also expressed concerns about the serious </p><p>situation which the Katanga fighting is creating inside </p><p>northern Zambia (Kinshasa 8622).  Kabila turned the issue </p><p>around to allege Zambian collaboration with Rwanda and the </p><p>RPA.  He claimed that President Chiluba had authorized Rwanda </p><p>to let an RPA brigade transit Zambia to attack Lubumbashi via </p><p>Kipushi.  The source of his information, Kabila said, is </p><p>senior Zambian military leadership, some of whom have ethnic, </p><p>familial and linguistic links in Katanga. </p><p>     As a result of his concern, Kabila said, he had taken </p><p>two measures.  He had phoned Chiluba personally to express </p><p>his "discontent" and to demand that Chiluba cease any further </p><p>collaboration with Rwanda and the RPA.  Second, he had sent </p><p>General Joseph Kabila and Katanga Governor Augustin Katumba </p><p>Mwanke to Lusaka this week to follow up with President </p><p>Chiluba.  During the three days they had been in Lusaka, they </p><p>had already seen Chiluba twice, he said.  He had instructed </p><p>Joseph Kabila to stay longer if necessary to "coordinate" on </p><p>the issue with the Zambians.  (Kabila claimed that because </p><p>Chibula\'s "security chief" has close ties with Rwanda, he </p><p>often gets Chiluba into difficulty, such as in this case.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CODEL Wolf </p><p>     The Ambassador informed Kabila that Congressman Frank </p><p>Wolf would be visiting the Congo (DRC) January 7-10 and urged </p><p>Kabila to meet with him and his delegation, noting that they </p><p>would also be traveling to Goma and Bukavu.  Kabila said that </p><p>he expected   at present to be in Kinshasa on January 8 and </p><p>would be pleased to see the Congressman that morning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A New Congolese Ambassador to UN Urgently Needed </p><p>     Kabila agreed with the Ambassador both that Andre </p><p>Kapanga has represented Kabila and the DRC well as Ambassador </p><p>to the UN, and that it would not be in the Congo\'s interest </p><p>to leave this key post vacant very long.  Kabila said that, </p><p>precisely because it is critical to find someone of Kapanga\'s </p><p>quality, it had taken longer than desired to name a </p><p>replacement.  He hoped, however, to be able to announce the </p><p>name of the new Ambassador soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.
