SUMMARY - US MISSION REPRESENTATIVES MET WITH FAO </p><p>DG JACQUES DIOUF TO DISCUSS FAO\'S ROLE IN THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  WE URGED </p><p>FAO TO TAKE A PUBLIC STANCE ON BIOTECH FOODS TO </p><p>CLARIFY MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF POLITICAL LEADERS </p><p>BASED, AT LEAST IN PART, ON MISINFORMATION </p><p>DISSEMINATED BY FAO REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SUB- </p><p>REGION.  DIOUF, IN A JOINT LETTER FROM WHO DG </p><p>BRUNDTLAND TO WFP ED MORRIS, PROPOSES A UN POLICY </p><p>WHICH, IN OUR VIEW, RAISES MORE DOUBTS ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL RISK OF CONSUMING U.S. FOOD AID THAN IT </p><p>SETTLES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.   ACTING PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AND US MISSION </p><p>AGRICULTURAL COUNSELOR MET WITH FAO DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL JACQUES DIOUF ON AUGUST 16 TO DISCUSS </p><p>FAO\'S ROLE IN QUELLING THE GROWING </p><p>MISUNDERSTANDING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA OF BIOTECH </p><p>FOOD AID BEING OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES </p><p>THROUGH THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM.  U.S. REPS </p><p>REITERATED OUR REQUEST MADE IN PREVIOUS DEMARCHES </p><p>TO FAO THAT THE FAO COMMUNICATE THAT, TO THE BEST </p><p>OF ITS KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY RISK </p><p>TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM BIOTECH FOODS, SPECIFICALLY </p><p>FROM FOOD AID SHIPMENTS IN RECENT YEARS BY THE </p><p>FAO.  US REPS CITED MISINFORMATION STILL BEING </p><p>DISSEMINATED BY THE FAO (ZIMBABWE IS A CASE IN </p><p>POINT). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04048  01 OF 02  191545Z </p><p>3.   DIOUF\'S RESPONSE WAS BUREAUCRATIC AND DEFENSIVE. </p><p>FAO CANNOT GET OUT IN FRONT OF WFP WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITY OF COORDINATING THE UN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE EMERGENCY SITUATION IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA, HE SAID.  FURTHERMORE, QUESTIONS OF HUMAN </p><p>HEALTH SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO WHO, NOT FAO.  HE </p><p>SAID FAO HAD CORRECTED INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE </p><p>FIELD, BUT WOULD NOT PROMISE TO REITERATE THAT </p><p>CORRECTION.  AND THE FAO HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF </p><p>BIOTECH FOOD BEING INCLUDED IN ANY SHIPMENTS OF </p><p>FOOD AID TO DATE.  HE SAID THE UNITED STATES WAS </p><p>NAIVE TO THINK THAT MERE INFORMATION COULD QUELL </p><p>CONCERNS, THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS POLITICAL ACTORS </p><p>BEHIND THE CURRENT FUROR IN SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE WRITTEN REPLY FROM DIOUF AND WHO DG BRUNTLAND </p><p>PLACES RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK ASSESSMENT ON </p><p>RECIPIENT COUNTRIES SINCE FAO HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN </p><p>SUCH AN ASSESSMENT.  IT STATES THAT, "BASED ON </p><p>NATIONAL INFORMATION FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES FAO </p><p>AND WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF GM </p><p>COMMODITIES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET IS NOT LIKELY </p><p>TO PRESENT AN APPRECIABLE HUMAN HEALTH RISK," BUT </p><p>GOES ON TO RECOMMEND CONSIDERATION OF PROCESSING </p><p>TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MILLING.  IT CALLS ON </p><p>RECIPIENTS TO "WEIGH THE SEVERE AND IMMEDIATE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF INSUFFICIENT FOOD SUPPLIES AGAINST </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASED RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH </p><p>FROM CONSUMING FOODS DERIVED FROM MODERN </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY AND THE ADDITIONAL RISK TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04048  01 OF 02  191545Z </p><p>BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE." </p><p>IT CITES THE ONGOING PROCESS IN CODEX ALIMENTARIUS </p><p>WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN GUIDELINES ON FOOD </p><p>SAFETY IN ANOTHER YEAR OR SO. </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE FAO HAS BEEN UNHELPFUL IN SEVERAL ASPECTS.  US </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES POINTED OUT THAT FAO HAD APPROVED </p><p>OF PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS OF FOOD AID WHICH, IN ALL </p><p>LIKELIHOOD, HAD CONTAINED BIOTECH FOOD SINCE IT </p><p>WAS INTRODUCED IN THE MID-1990\'S IN THE U.S. </p><p>DIOUF DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH CONTENT.  DIOUF </p><p>ALSO PURPORTED TO BE UNAWARE OF THE TOWN MEETING </p><p>IN LUSAKA REPORTED REFTEL AND SEEMED NOT TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT FAO\'S VOICE COULD HAVE PLAYED A </p><p>POSITIVE ROLE, AS DID WFP\'S.  (U.S. MISSION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES CONFIRMED WITH FAO OFFICES IN ROME </p><p>THAT NO RANKING REPRESENTATIVE OF FAO WAS PRESENT </p><p>AT THE LUSAKA MEETING, ONLY A NOTETAKER.)  DIOUF </p><p>DID SAY THAT FAO HAD TAKEN PROMPT ACTION TO </p><p>CORRECT THE MISINFORMATION REPORTED BY USAID </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4616 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04048  02 OF 02  191546Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   WHA-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  TEDE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   TEST-00  PRM-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------DB22AF  191546Z /03 </p><p>O 191506Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5452 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>SADC COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR IO, PRM, DEPT.

COMMENT - US MISSION BELIEVES THIS ISSUE HAS </p><p>REACHED A CRUCIAL STATE.  FAO HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL </p><p>IN REACHING A POSITIVE RESOLUTION OF THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA CRISIS.  THIS HAS BECOME EVEN MORE SERIOUS </p><p>IN LIGHT OF ZAMBIA\'S DECISION AUGUST 16 TO REJECT </p><p>BIOTECH FOOD AID, SPECIFICALLY U.S. CORN.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT FAO SHOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED THAT </p><p>SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THERE IS NO RISK </p><p>TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM CONSUMING BIOTECH FOOD AND </p><p>THAT THOSE RECEIVING FOOD AID THROUGH WFP HAVE NOT </p><p>REPORTED ANY NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS.  INSTEAD, </p><p>FAO FIELD REPRESENTATIVES HAVE CONTINUED TO </p><p>TRANSMIT INACCURATE INFORMATION ON BIOTECH FOOD </p><p>AND TO MISINTERPRET THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL RAISING </p><p>NEEDLESS DOUBTS AND FEAR.  WE REGRET THAT FAO HAS </p><p>NOT PROVIDED MEMBER GOVERNMENTS THE BENEFIT OF ITS </p><p>SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE IN THE CURRENT FOOD SECURITY </p><p>CRISIS.  ALTHOUGH FAO CONTINUES TO CHARACTERIZE </p><p>THE SITUATION IN TERMS OF MALNUTRITION, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT LIVES WILL BE LOST AS A RESULT OF FAO\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO ACT IN TIME. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04048 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
