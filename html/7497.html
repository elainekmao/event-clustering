<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 37 (4/16 1600 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2321 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Embassy staff are allowed greater freedom of movement </p><p>although restrictions are still in place. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On April 16 ICRC contacted Embassy to report an </p><p>AMCIT in Baghdad had approached their office there with a </p><p>request that he be returned to the US.  He also requested the </p><p>same assistance for his wife and daughter, who are not </p><p>AMCITS, and he claimed he has filed immigration petitions for </p><p>his wife and daughter in Amman.  We are in the process of </p><p>verification. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Situation remains stable; no new developments to </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) UNHCR reported April 16 that 220 persons currently are </p><p>being held in "no-man\'s land" at the Jordan-Iraq border.  Six </p><p>Syrians reportedly arrived the night of April 15/16.  In an </p><p>April 16 telcon, the Ambassador urged Minister of State </p><p>Shaher Bak to allow these groups to remain in "no-man\'s land" </p><p>until an appropriate solution can be found and reminded the </p><p>GOJ of its obligation to grant temporary admission and </p><p>protection  to all legitimate asylum seekers.  He also urged </p><p>the GOJ to allow seven Iraqis and four Palestinians to move </p><p>from "no-man\'s land" into the Ruweished camps, as had been </p><p>pledged to UNHCR on April 15.  Bak said the GOJ would allow </p><p>the 200-plus Iranians to remain in "no-man\'s land" until a </p><p>solution could be found and had directed GOJ authorities to </p><p>assist in the construction of additional humanitarian </p><p>infrastructure in "no-man\'s land."  Bak also promised to look </p><p>into the case of the seven Iraqis and four Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IOM reports that increasing numbers of TCNs are </p><p>entering Jordan:  75 on April 15 and 65 by 12:00 pm today. </p><p>Recent TCN arrivals report that Iraqis in Baghdad are </p><p>threatening foreign workers and pressuring them to leave, </p><p>telling them that they were guests of Saddam and no longer </p><p>are welcome in Baghdad.  IOM expects TCN arrivals to increase </p><p>still further and is increasing staff at the border and </p><p>Ruweished. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) According to PLO Refugee Affairs Rep Mohammed Abu </p><p>Bakr, 60-70 Palestinian families were expelled from their </p><p>homes in Baghdad on April 14.  They reportedly have gathered </p><p>at a park.  It is unclear whether they were expelled by </p><p>returning landlords or for political reasons.  (Long-term </p><p>Palestinian residents of Iraq are viewed by some Iraqis as </p><p>supporters of the Saddam regime and hence are vulnerable to </p><p>political reprisals.)  We have alerted the ICRC of this </p><p>matter. </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Media reaction on Syria-USG "standoff" indicates some </p><p>editorial writers believe the USG is "bluffing." (reftel). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
