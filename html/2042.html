EDITORIALS IN THE OCTOBER 9 EDITIONS OF THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" AND THE </p><p>   INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" FOCUS ON THE </p><p>   UNITED STATES-LED STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN.  FULL </p><p>   EDITORIAL TEXTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. GOVERNMENT MUST ACT </p><p>   CORRECTLY," THE "HERALD" COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>"THE U. S. FACES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND DREADFUL RISKS </p><p>NOW THAT IT HAS STARTED ITS BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW ANY STATE IS </p><p>ENTITLED TO DEFEND ITSELF AND IS ENTITLED TO RETALIATE </p><p>AGAINST THOSE WHO ATTACK IT AND THOSE WHO ACTIVELY </p><p>SUPPORT ITS ATTACKERS.  THE U. S. WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 11.  THE MAIN ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE </p><p>CARRIED OUT AGAINST CIVILIAN TARGETS WITH THE </p><p>DELIBERATE INTENTION OF KILLING CIVILIANS.  SO ASSUMING </p><p>THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST AL-QUAEDS, LED BY OSAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN, IS AS GOOD AS THE AMERICANS CLAIM, THEN THE </p><p>ATTACKS ON AL-QUAEDS AND THE TALIBAN RULERS OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN ARE JUSTIFIED.  THE TALIBAN HAVE SUPPORTED </p><p>AND PROTECTED AL-QUAEDS.  BUT THIS RIGHT OF SELF- </p><p>DEFENSE IS NOT A BLANK CHECK.  THE U. S. WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN BETTER ADVISED TO HAVE MADE PUBLIC THE EVIDENCE IT </p><p>HAS BEEN PRESENTING TO MANY OF ITS ALLIES, BOTH OLD AND </p><p>NEW, AS TO THE BLAMEWORTHINESS OF BOT AL-QUAEDS AND THE </p><p>TALIBAN.  THE EVIDENCE IS SAID TO BE IMPRESSIVE.  YET </p><p>MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03004  01 OF 02  091445Z </p><p>THEMSELVES AND MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.  IT IS </p><p>UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO DO SO. </p><p>CARPET BOMBING OF AFGHANISTAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD PUT </p><p>THE U. S. IN THE SAME CAMP AS THOSE WHO FLEW THE PLANES </p><p>INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  KILLING CIVILIANS FOR </p><p>IGNOBLE MOTIVES OF REVENGE IS TERRORISM.  THE INITIAL </p><p>ATTACKS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN AGAINST LEGITIMATE TARGETS </p><p>AND IT ALSO APPEARS, FROM THE CASUALTY TOLL, THAT THE </p><p>BOMBING EXHIBITED A HIGH DEGREE OF PRECISION.  IT IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL THAT FUTURE ATTACKS FOLLOW THE SAME COURSE. </p><p>IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT THE U. S. RESTRICTS ITS WAR </p><p>AIMS.  THE U. S. MUST RESISTS THE TEMPTATION TO TRY AND </p><p>IMPOSE SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT ON AFGHANISTAN.  THAT </p><p>MUST BE LEFT TO THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WITH THE ADVICE AND </p><p>HELP OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY </p><p>THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN WILL BE BOTH </p><p>NATIONALISTIC AND ISLAMIC.  AFTER ALL ALMOST ALL </p><p>AFGHANS ARE MUSLIMS AND, AS FOREIGN INVADERS HAVE </p><p>DISCOVERED, ARE INTENSELY NATIONALISTIC.  IT IS INDEED </p><p>HIGHLY LIKELY THAT ANY FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE </p><p>ALLIED TO BOTH IRAN AND PAKISTAN, ITS MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>NEIGHBORS, AND WILL BE CLOSER TO RUSSIA AND CHINA AMONG </p><p>THE GREAT POWERS THAN TO THE U. S.  SUCH A GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS UNLIKELY TO REGARD THE U. S. AS ITS BEST FRIEND AND </p><p>IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE OF THE AMERICANS TO EXPECT </p><p>THIS.  ALL THAT THE U. S. CAN EXPECT, AND IS ENTITLED </p><p>TO EXPECT, IS A GOVERNMENT THAT ACCEPTS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW.  THE U. S. IS REGARDED, JUSTIFIABLY, WITH GREAT </p><p>SUSPICION IN MUCH OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  ANY MEDDLING </p><p>IN AFGHAN POLITICS WOULD DOOM A RESULTANT GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE ISLAMIC SUSPICION OF THE U. S. HAS THREE STRANDS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03004  01 OF 02  091445Z </p><p>FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, IS THE U. S. BACKING IN </p><p>ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ISRAEL.  THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>INDICATIONS IN THE LAST WEEK THAT THE U. S. DOES </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE PALESTINIANS TOO HAVE RIGHTS, BUT MANY </p><p>WILL WANT TO SEE ACTION BEFORE THEY BELIEVE THIS. </p><p>SECONDLY, THERE IS THE GENERAL THIRD WORLD IRRITATION </p><p>WITH THE U. S.\'S ASSUMPTION OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE.  THE </p><p>U. S. NEEDS TO BE LESS DOMINEERING.  AND THIRDLY THERE </p><p>IS A DISTASTE OF THE SECULAR CONSUMER CULTURE OF THE U. </p><p>S., A GAP THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE BRIDGED BUT WHICH </p><p>NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD.  SO THE U. S. HAS THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY OF CRIPPLING AL-QUAEDS IN THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM AND GIVING THE AFGHAN PEOPLE A CHANCE TO HAVE </p><p>A GOVERNMENT THEY DESERVE.  IT RUNS THE RISK OF BEING </p><p>SEEN AS A BIG ANTI-ISLAMIC BULLY.  THE CHOICE IS UP TO </p><p>THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND IT MUST ACT AS CORRECTLY AS IT </p><p>HAS STARTED." </p><p> </p><p>3.

BUSH HAS </p><p>IGNORED WORLD OPINION NOT TO ACT HASTILY.  IT WAS </p><p>ESSENTIAL TO FURNISH THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH </p><p>SPECIFIC EVIDENCE LINKING THE CHIEF SUSPECT IN LAST </p><p>MONTH\'S ATTACK ON THE U. S., OSAMA BIN LADEN, TO THE </p><p>DASTARDLY ACTS.  THAT EVIDENCE REMAINS PRIVY TO THE </p><p>AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR BRITISH ALLIES.  IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE PREFERABLE TO LET THE WHOLE OF </p><p>THE WORLD KNOW OF THIS EVIDENCE FOR THEM TO MAKE AN </p><p>INFORMED DECISION, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS GOING TO BE IN </p><p>CONCERT WITH THAT OF THE AMERICANS.  BUT SUCH AN </p><p>ARGUMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS.  AMERICA </p><p>IS ENTITLED TO PURSUE ITS INTERESTS AND SECURITY, BUT </p><p>IN SO DOING IT IS ERODING THE ENORMOUS SYMPATHY AND </p><p>SUPPORT IT GARNERED SINCE THE ATTACKS ALMOST A MONTH </p><p>AGO.  AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO </p><p>SOPHISTICATED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE STRIKING TARGETS </p><p>OTHER THAN EXACT LOCATIONS OF BIN LADEN, IF IT IS </p><p>ACCEPTED THAT HE BE CONVICTED BEFORE A TRIAL.  BUT THAT </p><p>THEY SHOULD BE DROPPING BOMBS ALL OVER AFGHANISTAN </p><p>RAISES FAR MORE SERIOUS CONCERNS: THE CASUALTIES ARE </p><p>GOING TO BE MORE THAN THE ALLEGED PERPETRATORS OF THE </p><p>11 SEPTEMBER ATTACKS.  AFGHANISTAN IS A NATION OF </p><p>DISPLACED PEOPLE.  SUNDAY\'S BOMBINGS WILL HAVE HASTENED </p><p>THE WAVE OF AFGHANS FLEEING THEIR COUNTRY.  WHILE THEY </p><p>SEEK REFUGE IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, THERE IS </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION.  THERE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03004  02 OF 02  091445Z </p><p>COULD BE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG LEADERS IN THAT REGION </p><p>AS RESENTMENT AGAINST DISPLACEMENT AND AMERICA BUILDS </p><p>UP.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHE THAT </p><p>DRIVES PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES </p><p>FOR A CAUSE.  AMONG THOSE FLEEING AFGHANISTAN INTO </p><p>NEIGHBORING STATES ARE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO A CAUSE, ONE </p><p>OF THEM BEING TO FIGHT AMERICA.  THEY WILL BE DIFFICULT </p><p>TO DETECT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AN ARMY, BUT THE EFFECTS </p><p>OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE DEADLY.  THE FORMER SOVIET UNION </p><p>KNOWS THE LESSON TOO WELL.  IT MET ITS WATERLOO AGAINST </p><p>THE TALIBAN.  MANY OF THOSE BACKING THE AMERICAN </p><p>STRIKES AGAINST AFGHANISTAN DO SO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE </p><p>THE OUTCOME WILL CONVENIENTLY SOLVE THEIR OWN LONG- </p><p>STANDING PROBLEMS, WHOSE ORIGINS ARE SEEN AS EMANATING </p><p>FROM AFGHANISTAN OR THAT REGION OF THE WORLD.  BY </p><p>BOMBING AFGHANISTAN, THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ARE </p><p>MERELY VICTIMIZING THE ORDINARY AFGHANS WHO HAVE NO </p><p>CAPACITY TO ESCAPE OR HIDE FROM THE ATTACKS.  THE </p><p>QUESTION THEY WILL ASK IS: WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO WITH </p><p>BIN LADEN\'S AGENDA?  INSTEAD OF SYMPATHY MORE HATRED IS </p><p>ENGENDERED.  THE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE LEARNT FROM THE </p><p>NORTH ATLANTIC ORGANIZATION\'S EXPERIENCE IN YUGOSLAVIA. </p><p>THE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE USED THEIR SOPHISTICATED </p><p>INTELLIGENCE TO TRACK DOWN BIN LADEN AND BRING HIM TO </p><p>JUSTICE WITHOUT RISKING UNNECESSARY CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES.  IT IS POSSIBLE THE CHIEF SUSPECT IS </p><p>NOWHERE NEAR THE PLACES BEING BOMBED AS HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>LONG ANTICIPATED THIS ACTION.  THE LIVES AND SECURITY </p><p>OF NATIONALS BELONGING TO THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE NOW IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY.

THE 11 SEPTEMBER ATTACKS DEMONSTRATE THE DILEMMA </p><p>THE WORLD FACES IN ANTICIPATING THE ACTION OF THE </p><p>TERRORIST ENEMY.  BUT THIS MAY BE AN ENEMY FOR WHICH </p><p>THERE IS NO DEARTH OF RECRUITS.  SO EVEN THE EVENTUAL </p><p>CAPTURE OF BIN LADEN WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT GUARANTEES </p><p>AGAINST FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM.  IF BIN LADEN IS THE </p><p>MAN BUSH SAYS HE IS, THEN THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES MAY </p><p>HAVE FALLEN FOR THE CHIEF SUSPECT\'S PLAN." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
