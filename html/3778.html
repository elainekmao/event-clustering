<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001853 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S MAOISTS ANNOUNCE NEW PROGRAM OF AGITATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1832 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1797 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 1772 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Maoist insurgents, apparently hoping to keep up the </p><p>momentum from their successful September 16 general strike, </p><p>have announced a fresh campaign of agitation, including a </p><p>three-day general strike preceding scheduled national </p><p>Parliamentary elections in November.  The press release, </p><p>dated September 21, also notes the Maoists\' readiness to </p><p>resume negotiations and enter into a ceasefire if "a positive </p><p>political solution" to the conflict is found.  Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba has expressed willingness to resume </p><p>negotiations with the insurgents in principle, but the </p><p>Maoists\' shadowy organization and surreptitious methods leave </p><p>him unsure of which would-be mediators are authoritative </p><p>interlocutors.  The burden remains on the Maoists to assure </p><p>the Government of the sincerity of their overtures.   The </p><p>insurgents have released the pilot and passenger abducted </p><p>after the destruction of their helicopter September 19.  The </p><p>Maoists have also released 200 students in eastern Nepal\'s </p><p>Ramechhap District kidnapped from their school the same day. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MAOISTS PROCLAIM MORE AGITATION, </p><p>THREE-DAY BANDH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Apparently hoping to capitalize on the relative </p><p>success of their September 16 general strike, or "bandh" (Ref </p><p>B), the Maoists have announced a new program of agitation, </p><p>protests, and "mobilization," culminating in a three-day </p><p>nationwide bandh November 11-13 that coincides with the </p><p>beginning of national elections.  The September 21 press </p><p>release, issued on behalf of the Maoists\' central committee </p><p>by Maoist leaders Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai and deemed </p><p>authentic by media outlets, labels the November 13 elections </p><p>a feudal "conspiracy" and notes the "threat" of royal </p><p>intervention under Clause 127 of the Constitution (Ref C). </p><p>To protest against both the "sham" elections and the </p><p>possibility of royal intervention, the release announced the </p><p>following five-stage program: </p><p> </p><p>Sept 22 - Oct. 6:  Publicity/propaganda </p><p>Oct. 7 - Oct. 27:  Regonal/local-level programs (not further </p><p>identified); </p><p>Oct. 27:  Strike in Terai (southern plains area along Indian </p><p>border) and Tharuwan (southwestern districts of Banke, </p><p>Bardiya, Kailali, and Kanchanpur); </p><p>Oct. 28 - Nov. 10:  "Vast public mobilization"; </p><p>Nov. 11 - Nov. 13:  Nepal Bandh (nationwide general strike). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The press release notes the Maoists\' earlier calls </p><p>for "negotiation for an immediate political solution," and </p><p>asserted they remain open to resuming talks.  "We guarantee </p><p>more flexibility and responsibility and would like to say if </p><p>a conducive solution is found, then we will be ready for a </p><p>ceasefire and will withdraw the programs scheduled."   If, </p><p>however, "the feudal tyrannical rulers are obstinate . . we </p><p>will fight to the death and continue the scheduled programs." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>PM OPEN TO TALKS IN PRINCIPLE, </p><p>BUT WHO TO TALK WITH? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has told the </p><p>Ambassador he is open to resuming talks with the Maoists, but </p><p>remains uncertain which of numerous would-be interlocutors </p><p>can speak authoritatively for the Maoist leadership (Ref C). </p><p>Having been duped by the Maoists in talks last year, the PM </p><p>is doubly cautious this time.  He fears the allusions to </p><p>talks may be no more than a ploy to buy time and to postpone </p><p>national elections he has pledged to hold on time. If the </p><p>Maoists genuinely want to negotiate, he reasons, they know </p><p>where to find him. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>HELO PILOT, PASSENGER SAFE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The pilot and passenger of a helicopter destroyed </p><p>by Maoist insurgents while on a humanitarian mission in </p><p>Solukhumbu District September 19 (Ref A) were set free late </p><p>the following day and have since returned to Kathmandu </p><p>safely.  The pilot, Arun Malla, said his captors were mainly </p><p>teenage boys about 15-16 years of age who eventually </p><p>apologized for holding him.  They explained they had a </p><p>mission to destroy all aircraft that could be used in </p><p>security operations against them and said they meant him no </p><p>personal harm.  (Note:  Security forces occasionally use </p><p>charter aircraft, especially helicopters.  The helicopter </p><p>destroyed in this incident, however, was on a humanitarian </p><p>mission to airlift a sick man to Kathmandu to attend the </p><p>funeral of his wife.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Malla said he was well treated during his brief </p><p>captivity, most of which was spent marching through dense </p><p>jungle.  He overnighted with his captors in a </p><p>Maoist-controlled village, where he met the 27-year-old local </p><p>commander and was given a meal of potatoes.  He was then </p><p>marched some distance the following day to neighboring </p><p>Khotang District, where he was able to call his family and </p><p>employers on his cell phone, advise them of his whereabouts, </p><p>and ask for a helicopter to pick him and his fellow captive </p><p>up.  The Maoists then returned his wallet, which they had </p><p>confiscated earlier, and urged him to count the money to be </p><p>sure that it was all there.  Karnali Air sent another </p><p>helicopter to the location, which landed without incident and </p><p>picked up the captives. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The owner of Karnali Air, retired Army officer and </p><p>former MP Narayan Singh Pun, told us the loss of this </p><p>helicopter leaves only four in his inventory.  (Note:  The </p><p>Embassy relies upon Karnali for all its medevacs from the </p><p>Annapurna Circuit.  Karnali is also one of just a few </p><p>companies capable of performing medevacs from the Everest </p><p>Base Camp.  End note.) Another aviation source speculated </p><p>that insurance rates, already climbing because of the </p><p>insurgency, might be raised yet again, putting the ability of </p><p>private helo operators to continue air services in question. </p><p>A September 22 meeting chaired by Civil Aviation Minister Bal </p><p>Bahadur K.C. (who is from Solukhumbu District and, who, </p><p>according to local press, had personally requested the </p><p>hapless special flight), decided that no more helicopter </p><p>flights will take place to areas where the security </p><p>environment is inadequate. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>RECRUITMENT RAID IN RAMECHHAP? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  On September 19 Maoists abducted approximately 200 </p><p>people, including students and teachers from a village in </p><p>Ramechhap District in the east.  The students ranged in age </p><p>from 12 to 16.  According to the Ramechhap Chief District </p><p>Office (CDO), the captives were taken to Okhaldunga, a </p><p>neighboring district to the east.  All of the captives were </p><p>later released and returned safely to Ramechhap the same </p><p>evening.  No one at the CDO\'s Office could say why the </p><p>captives were taken to Okhaldunga or why they were abducted </p><p>in the first place, although there was some speculation that </p><p>the Maoists had may have wanted to recruit the abductees as </p><p>cadre. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Both the destruction of the helicopter and the </p><p>apparent mass abduction in Ramechhap are further indications </p><p>of the ever-deteriorating law and order situation in the </p><p>country, and demonstrate the continued brutal tactics of the </p><p>Maoists.  The helicopter incident could further limit our </p><p>ability to medevac sick AmCits from remote locations.  The </p><p>Maoists\' announcement of their campaign intensifies </p><p>pre-election pressure on the Government of Nepal (GON), </p><p>already under fire from other political parties, to re-engage </p><p>in talks.  Until the Maoists can demonstrate the seriousness </p><p>of this latest offer, however, the PM will be hard pressed to </p><p>take them up on it.  Having let the Maoists know that he is </p><p>open to talks under the right conditions, the Prime Minister </p><p>has put the burden back on the insurgents to prove their </p><p>sincerity. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
