<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: BUDGET COULD BE PASSED "IN TWO </p><p>WEEKS;" CONCERN WITH FOREIGN BANK LINES </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The Turkish Ministry of Finance\'s top </p><p>budget expert told us the process of enacting the 2003 budget </p><p>could take as little as two weeks.   But the Government is </p><p>delaying submission of the budget to parliament, per this </p><p>expert, because it has not agreed with the IMF over measures </p><p>needed to reach the 6.5 percent of GNP primary budget </p><p>surplus.  This expert confirmed that the IMF position still </p><p>shows a 1.5 percent of GNP or $3 billion shortfall towards </p><p>this primary surplus target.  By not moving quickly to pass a </p><p>2003 budget which the IMF can support, the GOT risks putting </p><p>itself in a vulnerable situation vis a vis the markets.  One </p><p>foreign bank told us of indications that one of the major </p><p>European bank lenders to Turkish banks is already limiting or </p><p>pulling its lines.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Budget Process "A Matter of Two Weeks" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkey\'s 2003 budget could be enacted into law in </p><p>as little as two weeks, according to Turkish Finance Ministry </p><p>Deputy DG for the budget Ahmet Kesik.  Kesik outlined the </p><p>four-step process for us: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The "Higher Planning Council" (a subset of Cabinet </p><p>ministers and econ agency heads) must meet and approve the </p><p>budget law (status: done); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The full Cabinet must approve and submit the budget to </p><p>parliament (status:  Cabinet has discussed but not yet </p><p>submitted it to parliament.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Parliament\'s Budget and Planning Commission approves </p><p>the budget, and prepares a report recommending its passage by </p><p>the full parliament (Kesik said this could take as little as </p><p>two days); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The full parliament votes on the budget </p><p>article-by-article (the 2003 budget law has about 50 </p><p>articles, but the two political parties in parliament could </p><p>agree to limit debate.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Kesik added that the reason the full Cabinet has </p><p>not yet approved the budget was the impasse with the IMF.  He </p><p>confirmed that the IMF sees the draft budgetary measures they </p><p>would accept as yielding a 5.0 percent of GNP primary surplus </p><p>(the IMF cannot accept the GOT\'s proposed delay of the </p><p>"Direct Income Support" for farmers, worth about 0.5 percent </p><p>of GNP), whereas the GOT sees a 6.5 percent primary surplus </p><p>in its existing draft.  (The 1.5 percent of GNP gap is about </p><p>$ 3 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  The current interim budget expires March </p><p>31.   The GOT could in theory pass another interim, and </p><p>continue negotiating with the IMF over the full year primary </p><p>surplus measures, but then it risks the following dangerous </p><p>scenario: a conflict with Iraq, no budget, no IMF agreement </p><p>and an unhappy bond market.  On the IMF front, resrep told us </p><p>there is still no progress on closing the 1.5 percent of GNP </p><p>primary surplus gap.  In fact, MinFin Unakitan, in a meeting </p><p>this week, raised with IMF staff the possibility of new VAT </p><p>tax cuts for certain sectors (milk products and funeral </p><p>services.)  IMF staff believes the GOT still hopes to move </p><p>the USG off our conditionality language, and thus obviate the </p><p>need to take difficult budget measures required by the IMF. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An Initial Sign of Trouble with Foreign Bank Confidence </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Barclays Bank Turkey managers Matt Vogel and Burak </p><p>Ince told us 2/27 that they see signs, and are hearing </p><p>rumors, that one of the major European bank lenders to </p><p>Turkish banks has pulled or at least limited credit lines to </p><p>Turkish banks.  The sign is that over past two days several </p><p>Turkish banks approached Barclays seeking short-term "repo" </p><p>(i.e., Turkish T-bill-backed) loans.  Barclays is not a major </p><p>lender to Turkish banks and the sudden, large-scale demand </p><p>for these repo deals indicates that one of the three major </p><p>European lenders (currently Dresdner, Credit Agricole and </p><p>West LB) has stopped lending. </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment:  Turkish banks may want to continue to </p><p>roll-over their T-bill lending to the GOT, even in the </p><p>absence of a U.S. package or an IMF agreement, but their </p><p>ability to do so has funding constraints, and foreign bank </p><p>credit lines are an important element in these constraints. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
