<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001553 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S, D, P, SA; NSC FOR MILLARD; CINCPAC FOR </p><p>POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PINS, PREL, PTER, CE, ECONOMICS, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA:  DEPUTY SECRETARY MEETS PRIME MINISTER: </p><p>WAR, PEACE, TERRORISM, DEVELOPMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills; reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: In a very cordial half-hour August 22 </p><p>meeting (followed by a press conference and a working dinner) </p><p>with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe,  Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage stressed US support for the GSL\'s ongoing </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>efforts to reach a negotiated solution to Sri Lanka\'s 20-year </p><p>civil war.  The Deputy Secretary noted that his visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka, coming less than a month after the PM\'s meeting with </p><p>President Bush in Washington, should serve as a visible </p><p>manifestation of the strength of US support for the </p><p>still-fledgling peace process.  The Deputy Secretary, who had </p><p>visited the war-torn Jaffna peninsula earlier in the day, </p><p>told the PM that while the US could not provide the answer </p><p>for Sri Lanka\'s problems, and could not serve as an "honest </p><p>broker" between the GSL and the terrorist LTTE, the US could </p><p>help Sri Lanka realize its tremendous potential. He urged the </p><p>PM to continue to make efforts to get along with President </p><p>Kumaratunga to ensure that the peace process did not break </p><p>down because of discord within the GSL.  In response to the </p><p>PM\'s urging, the Deputy Secretary promised to raise with the </p><p>Japanese the possibility of a more energetic "friends of Sri </p><p>Lanka" aid donor group that would help Sri Lanka raise the </p><p>estimated $500 million it will need over the next five years </p><p>to address the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and </p><p>restoration of the war-impacted northern and eastern regions </p><p>of the island. The PM provided a relatively upbeat assessment </p><p>of Sri Lanka\'s economy in the coming year; the Deputy </p><p>Secretary noted that economic growth would enable Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to raise internally some of the money it needs to rebuild the </p><p>nation. The PM expressed great satisfaction with his visit to </p><p>Washington last month, saying the meeting with President Bush </p><p>had helped shore up support for the peace process among the </p><p>majority Sinhalese, many of whom remain skeptical about the </p><p>possibility of peace with the Tamil LTTE.  He expressed </p><p>appreciation for the positive role played by the United </p><p>States in Sri Lanka, and hoped for ever closer relations </p><p>between the two countries.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Deputy Secretary of State Armitage made an August 22 </p><p>call on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the PM\'s </p><p>official residence.  In the cordial thirty-minute meeting, </p><p>the Prime Minister had with him Minister for Economic Reform </p><p>Milinda Moragoda (Amcit), MFA Foreign Secretary Nihal </p><p>Rodrigo, and the PM\'s Secretary Bradman Weerakoon. </p><p>Accompanying the Deputy Secretary were the Ambassador, NSC </p><p>Senior Director for Asian Affairs James Moriarity, SA PDAS </p><p>Michele Sison, Special Assistant Kara Bue, and Colombo DCM </p><p>(notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Deputy Secretary opened the conversation by </p><p>discussing his trip earlier in the day to war-torn Jaffna </p><p>city and peninsula (septel). He described the devastation he </p><p>had seen and related some of the conversations he had with </p><p>local residents.  He noted the irony that some of the </p><p>interlocutors criticized the GSL on human rights grounds, but </p><p>apparently had no fear of doing so in the presence of heavily </p><p>armed Sri Lanka troops and senior GSL officials, including </p><p>Minister Moragoda.  He said, however, all of the persons with </p><p>whom he spoke in Jaffna gave the PM high marks for his </p><p>efforts to end the war, even if they had doubts that he could </p><p>succeed in convincing the Sinhalese majority to come to terms </p><p>with the Tamil minority.  The PM recalled his own visit to </p><p>Jaffna in which SA A/S Rocca accompanied him, saying that he </p><p>had received a very warm welcome from the Tamils there, who </p><p>clearly want the 20-year war to end.  He said that the human </p><p>rights situation has improved markedly but that the GSL still </p><p>had not provided the people of Jaffna with a tangible "peace </p><p>dividend" (as noted below, the Sri Lankans would return to </p><p>this topic.)  He noted, for example, that landmines -- an </p><p>estimated two million mines -- remain a major threat to the </p><p>population in the north and inhibit the ability of people to </p><p>resume normal lives. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Deputy Secretary expressed great satisfaction with </p><p>the PM\'s visit to Washington last month and, especially, his </p><p>meeting with President Bush.  He noted that the US </p><p>bureaucracy has moved very quickly in response to GSL </p><p>requests for assistance in the areas of intelligence, </p><p>security, trade, investment, and aid.  He noted that his own </p><p>visit, coming less than a month after the PM\'s meeting with </p><p>President Bush, should serve as a strong manifestation of US </p><p>support for the PM\'s efforts to bring peace to Sri Lanka. </p><p>Over the coming months Sri Lanka will receive the visits of </p><p>US assessment teams to look at how the US can assist Sri </p><p>Lanka in the areas mentioned by the GSL as needing help.  He </p><p>noted that the intelligence team (septel) and a team from the </p><p>Peace Corps are in the country. He also commented that the US </p><p>has a demining team in Sri Lanka which has removed a </p><p>considerable number of mines and UXO in the Jaffna peninsula </p><p>and continued to do so -- the Deputy Secretary had visited a </p><p>site near Jaffna where the team works. He stressed that the </p><p>US  could not provide the answer for Sri Lanka\'s problems, </p><p>and could not serve as an "honest broker" between the GSL and </p><p>the terrorist LTTE (as some people wanted), but the US could </p><p>help Sri Lanka realize its tremendous potential. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked the PM how the visit to </p><p>Washington had played in Sri Lanka.  The PM laughed and said </p><p>"it helped me politically."  He went on to explain that </p><p>certain sectors in the Sinhalese majority south have great </p><p>reservations about negotiating with the LTTE.  They view with </p><p>great satisfaction the fact that the USG has the LTTE on its </p><p>list of FTOs.  Hence, the PM noted, to have the US, known for </p><p>being anti-terrorist, support his peace efforts gives him </p><p>political coverage with the Sinhalese doubters. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Moragoda interjected that for the peace process to </p><p>continue to receive support, or at least not encounter </p><p>serious opposition, the GSL needs to show a "peace dividend." </p><p> The PM hopes to launch an international effort to raise $500 </p><p>million over the next five years for the rebuilding of the </p><p>war-affected areas.  Moragoda noted that Japan continues to </p><p>be the biggest donor to Sri Lanka and said that the GSL needs </p><p>US help to convince the Japanese to lead an international </p><p>effort ("Friends of Sri Lanka") to raise the funds. Moragoda </p><p>commented that the donor group has not had a formal meeting </p><p>in some time, and thought one could prove helpful.  He </p><p>remarked that the Indians have provided Sri Lanka some </p><p>credits and seemed willing to do more. He hoped the US could </p><p>galvanize donors to greater generosity. He also stressed that </p><p>an FTA with the US could serve as a key component in the </p><p>GSL\'s economic recovery strategy. The PM said that Sri Lanka </p><p>needed a great deal of technical expertise to modernize its </p><p>economy and governmental structure.  Despite that and a </p><p>drought earlier this year which affected food production and </p><p>power generation, the GSL hoped to have economic growth of </p><p>about 3 percent this year as compared to a negative 1.3 </p><p>percent last year.  The PM said he hoped to get Sri Lanka </p><p>back to a growth rate of about 9 percent/year. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Deputy Secretary replied that the Bush </p><p>Administration had reversed the prior decision to close the </p><p>AID mission in Colombo, and sought to increase funding for </p><p>AID in Sri Lanka.  He and the Ambassador also noted that the </p><p>Administration\'s "Millennium Challenge Account" could </p><p>potentially prove very beneficial to Sri Lanka, although no </p><p>decisions have yet been made. He promised to talk to the </p><p>Japanese during his forthcoming visit to Tokyo and said he </p><p>would relay their response to the GSL via the Ambassador.  He </p><p>commented that if the Sri Lanka can get a growth rate of 3 </p><p>percent, not to mention 9 percent, it could begin to provide </p><p>funds for rebuilding from its own sources.  Deputy Secretary </p><p>Armitage and the Ambassador said that while an FTA might be a </p><p>ways off, the US and Sri Lanka can use the recently-signed </p><p>TIFA to provide the framework for negotiating a mutually </p><p>satisfactory trade arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Turning to the subject of India, the Deputy Secretary </p><p>said that the Indians have expressed great interest in what </p><p>"the US is doing in Sri Lanka" and seemed to pay considerable </p><p>attention to his visit. PDAS Sison noted that the Indian </p><p>Embassy in Washington had been very interested in the PM\'s </p><p>meeting with President Bush. Moragoda said the Indians remain </p><p>a bit "worried" by the greater US profile in Sri Lanka but </p><p>that this seems to be dissipating. In response to the Deputy </p><p>Secretary\'s question, the Foreign Secretary provided an </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>upbeat account of the recent SAARC meeting he attended. He </p><p>said Indian and Pakistani representatives had a brief but </p><p>cordial encounter. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Deputy Secretary Armitage asked about the PM\'s </p><p>relations with President Kumaratunga.  He stated that </p><p>"cohabitation" is the only real option if the peace process </p><p>is going to work, and the peace process "is the only game in </p><p>town."  The PM agreed, but related his difficulties with the </p><p>President who seems lukewarm about the peace process.  He </p><p>described a letter he had just received from her highly </p><p>critical of the GSL and essentially accusing it of kowtowing </p><p>to the LTTE.  The PM had decided not to reply to the </p><p>President\'s letter. The PM said he hoped to have a private </p><p>meeting with the President upon her return from the UK next </p><p>week. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Deputy Secretary\'s visit was clearly a big hit </p><p>with the GSL -- he is the most senior USG representative to </p><p>visit the country in nearly 20 years.  The PM is obviously </p><p>still basking in the glory of his recent visit to the US and </p><p>in the notably increased official American attention to Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s efforts to end 20 years of war and fifty years of </p><p>socialist economics.  The GSL has repeatedly told us that it </p><p>wants even greater US involvement in Sri Lanka, and this </p><p>attitude came through clearly throughout the Deputy </p><p>Secretary\'s visit. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The PM clearly worries about the unpredictable </p><p>President Kumaratunga, who although suffering some </p><p>significant political reverses in the past few months remains </p><p>a formidable political force in the Sinhalese south. He also </p><p>worries about the state of Sri Lanka\'s economy and the need </p><p>to show a "peace dividend." The Deputy Secretary\'s visit has </p><p>provided the GSL a needed expression of international support </p><p>as it plans to enter into formal dialogue with the LTTE next </p><p>month in Thailand and should help firm up the GSL\'s resolve </p><p>to take on the long and difficult task of bringing decades of </p><p>communal warfare and terrorism to an end. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
