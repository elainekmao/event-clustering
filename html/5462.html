ANKARA 745 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Amid an edgy public mood over Iraq, a </p><p>strident anti-American propaganda campaign is underway in </p><p>Turkey, encouraged by various political and Turkish State </p><p>actors.  According to our contacts, such rhetoric is </p><p>resonating with the man on the street, who is (1) convinced </p><p>that an operation will tank Turkey\'s already weak economy and </p><p>(2) susceptible to arguments that the U.S.\'s anti-Saddam </p><p>policy is motivated by anti-Muslim feelings.  That the Kurds </p><p>of Southeastern Turkey reportedly are less susceptible to </p><p>"Turkish" propaganda is further feeding official and press </p><p>paranoia about U.S. intentions.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Multiheaded Anti-Americanism </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A number of actors, including politicians, media, and </p><p>elements of the Turkish State, have a hand in the current </p><p>anti-American propaganda effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ref (A) notes recent allegations in the press, including </p><p>in media baron Aydin Dogan\'s mainstream daily "Milliyet", of </p><p>USG support for the terrorist PKK/KADEK.  As reported in Ref </p><p>(B), the MFA has strongly intimated to us that suspicions in </p><p>the Turkish General Staff (TGS), reflected in a report leaked </p><p>to the press alleging contact between DoD officials and the </p><p>PKK, are driving the current press campaign.  Jan. 29 edition </p><p>of "Hurriyet," another Dogan Group mass daily, ran a column </p><p>asserting that Parliament\'s Human Rights committee recently </p><p>met with incarcerated PKK Number Two man Semdin Sakik (aka </p><p>Fingerless Zeki), captured in 1998.  According to "Hurriyet," </p><p>Sakik claimed the PKK acquired U.S. weapons left behind after </p><p>the first Gulf War -- and that the USG supports establishment </p><p>of an independent Kurdish state in Iraq.  In a private </p><p>meeting with us Jan. 29, Human Rights committee chairman </p><p>Elkatmis (AK Party) portrayed himself as buying Sakik\'s </p><p>remarks.  Continuing to play to latent anti-American </p><p>instincts in his left-of-center CHP, main opposition leader </p><p>Deniz Baykal also promoted the Sakik remarks in a CNN Turk </p><p>interview on Feb. 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Internet-based letter-writing protest campaigns are </p><p>underway against the U.S. (ref G); we are charged with </p><p>nefarious "plans" for Turkey.  One e-mail form letter </p><p>admonishes the Embassy not to "take our hospitality for </p><p>granted; we have other characteristics as a nation which you </p><p>should certainly get a better grasp of (sic)."  Consular </p><p>section has already received about 450 such e-mails. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ref (C) notes that the Genc (Youth) Party of Motorola </p><p>deadbeat Cem Uzan is waging a virulent anti-American mass </p><p>media campaign of its own.  Genc is using both the Uzan </p><p>family\'s own extensive TV and newspaper resources and daily </p><p>ads on page two of Dogan group papers (including "Milliyet," </p><p>which gave front-page coverage and legitimacy to the U.S.-PKK </p><p>story).  TV and print ads depict a devastated landscape, ask </p><p>"who will America hit" -- the clear implication is that </p><p>Turkey will suffer -- and assert that Turkey has no interest </p><p>in being used by the U.S. to strike "another Muslim country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Recent protest marches in Istanbul and Ankara by an </p><p>amalgam of left-right and Islamic activists featured </p><p>diatribes against U.S. "imperialism" and chants proclaiming </p><p>the greatness of God.  While expressing solidarity with the </p><p>Iraqi people, demonstrators also waved posters portraying </p><p>Saddam as a sympathetic hero.  Several contacts, including </p><p>the Turkish correspondent for a British defense weekly and a </p><p>former Turkish NSC staffer who has maintained close ties to </p><p>the TGS, have drawn our attention to the fact that until the </p><p>last month anti-American protest marches -- including a large </p><p>one planned for Izmir -- had consistently been disallowed by </p><p>the authorities.  Approval of marches now is an indirect way </p><p>for the Turkish State to signal its criticism of U.S. policy, </p><p>our contacts independently noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Contacts of all stripes and levels suggest to us that </p><p>the campaign is feeding simmering perceptions and resentment: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek told us Jan. 27 that his own </p><p>polls show Genc, which came out of nowhere before the Nov. 3 </p><p>elections and made a surprisingly strong run for Parliament, </p><p>as Turkey\'s second most popular party, ahead of the </p><p>opposition CHP though still behind the ruling AKP.  AK party </p><p>vice chairman for political strategy echoed this view to us </p><p>Jan. 29. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former P.M. Ecevit has been featured in the media </p><p>reiterating blanket assertions that he has long been aware of </p><p>U.S. support for the PKK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Picking up on similar allegations, Mumtaz Yavuz, Vice </p><p>Chairman of right-of-center True Path Party (DYP) told us </p><p>Jan. 28 that new DYP boss Mehmet Agar is charging that "there </p><p>would not be 30 thousand (sic) PKK members in Northern Iraq </p><p>without the support of the USG."  Yavuz also asserted that </p><p>the USG is supporting a de facto Kurdish state in Iraq and </p><p>admonished us to abide by a "Turkish State view" on Kurdish </p><p>issues.  Agar, a former interior minister and senior police </p><p>official and now the chairman of right-of-center DYP, is </p><p>intimately familiar with the reality of USG support for </p><p>Turkey against PKK/KADEK, but insists on perpetuating the </p><p>myth of the U.S.-PKK connection.  Turks also label him as: 1) </p><p>a symbol of what they call the "Deep State" owing to his </p><p>implication in the notorious 1996 Susurluk scandal, which </p><p>gave the Turkish public a penetrating -- if fleeting -- </p><p>glimpse at the then-prevalent connections among the armed </p><p>forces, security and intel services, extrajudicial hit </p><p>squads, and groups like Turkish Hizbullah; and 2) a </p><p>politician with particularly strong ties to organized crime </p><p>hit squads (refs E,F). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Conversations with ordinary citizens bear out the </p><p>success of the campaign.  In recent days, Turks on the street </p><p>have: 1) accused us of threatening to "kill children" in </p><p>Iraq; 2) charged that the USG agenda "is all about oil;" and </p><p>3) asserted that we are hamstringing the AK Government by </p><p>preventing it from focusing on the shaky Turkish economy.  A </p><p>Fulbrighter reported to us receiving a death threat from a </p><p>group of street toughs -- the target audience of the Genc </p><p>campaign -- out seeking confrontation with Americans.  Other </p><p>contacts, from tradesmen and taxi drivers to M.P.s, tell us </p><p>the worst part is the uncertainty they see in U.S. policy, an </p><p>uncertainty fueling continuing uncertainty at the retail </p><p>level: "Just get it over with" is a common refrain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>"Aren\'t the Kurds Muslims, Too?" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The one region of Turkey where anti-American </p><p>sentiments appear to be minimal is the predominately Kurdish </p><p>Southeast (ref D).  In recent days, Southeastern contacts </p><p>including several CHP and AK M.P.s -- ethnic Turks and Kurds </p><p>alike -- prominent figures in the nominally illegal </p><p>Naksibendi tarikat (a sufi order particularly influential in </p><p>the region), and NGO reps, have suggested to us that local </p><p>Kurds support immediate USG intervention in Iraq.  Some of </p><p>Turkey\'s Kurds, they note, also have close, even familial, </p><p>ties to Masud Barzani and the KDP.  According to our </p><p>contacts, Kurds are looking forward to the prospect of what </p><p>they hope are thousands of American soldiers bringing </p><p>economic benefits with them to the Southeast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Above all, our contacts express hope that the presence </p><p>of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Southeastern Turkey would make </p><p>it harder for the Turkish State to repress Kurds on either </p><p>side of the border.  As one CHP M.P. from Diyarbakir told us </p><p>Jan. 27, his constituents\' primary concern is that the </p><p>Turkish military might "precipitate a massacre" of Kurds to </p><p>keep the lid on the region.  One Naksibendi Shaykh asked us </p><p>rhetorically Jan. 24 if Embassy ever wonders why "they" -- </p><p>meaning the Turks -- "have only enemies everywhere?"  Another </p><p>Naksibendili, formerly an M.P. with the Islamist Refah party </p><p>and affiliated with Saadet, told us recently that he and </p><p>other Kurds had expressed their displeasure to AK with the </p><p>recent visit to Iraq by AK Trade Minister Kursad Tuzmen, a </p><p>nationalist formerly with the right-wing MHP.  "The Turks say </p><p>we don\'t want to make war on Muslims," he said.  "We asked </p><p>them (the GOT) \'aren\'t the Kurds Muslims, too?\'" </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We have been vigorously rebutting the scurrilous </p><p>U.S.-PKK accusations at all levels of the GOT and the </p><p>political class.  In this context we note that, beyond the </p><p>evident hardening of public attitudes as a result of the </p><p>media campaign, several aspects of this story potentially </p><p>have an even more profound impact on efforts to promote USG </p><p>equities here.  One factor is the willing participation of </p><p>mainstream press barons with close pecuniary and other ties </p><p>to the Establishment.  Resorting to Sakik "confessions" is a </p><p>tried and true tactic.  In 1998, the mainstream press </p><p>highlighted alleged Sakik "confessions" to the security </p><p>forces implicating numerous politicians and several </p><p>journalists with a balanced view of the U.S., forcing at </p><p>least one journalist, Cengiz Candar, to go into self-imposed </p><p>exile in Washington for a time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
