(C) The current picture in Turkey for International </p><p>Organizations, the United Nations, and international NGOs for </p><p>cross-border humanitarian operations is still unclear.  To </p><p>date, no international organization has received an official </p><p>permit to transit humanitarian supplies through Turkey to </p><p>northern Iraq.  The World Food Program (WFP), under the U.N. </p><p>Development Program,s (UNDP) umbrella, does support school </p><p>feeding programs in northern Iraq through Turkey.  However, </p><p>from February 27 through March 7, 41 World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>trucks traveling to Kurdish-controlled areas, carrying high </p><p>protein biscuits, vegetable oil, and chickpeas, were unable </p><p>to cross the Turkish-Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Movement by international NGOs to apply for transit </p><p>permits, as well as registration status, with the Government </p><p>of Turkey,s (GOT) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has been </p><p>slow.  On March 10, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) </p><p>submitted a transit and registration application to the MFA. </p><p>Three other international NGOs (International Medical Corps, </p><p>and Northwest Medical Team, and Save the Children/USA) are in </p><p>Ankara preparing to submit applications to the MFA so that </p><p>they can move personnel and supplies through Turkey to </p><p>northern Iraq. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Current Picture in Turkey for Cross-Border International </p><p>Humanitarian Operations </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The current picture in Turkey for cross-border </p><p>international humanitarian organizations is as follows: </p><p>A)    International NGOs have generally not been allowed </p><p>access to northern Iraq from Turkey since 1996. </p><p>B)    Only two international NGOs have current registration </p><p>status with the GOT to operate in Turkey, Amnesty </p><p>International and the International Catholic Migration </p><p>Commission (ICMC).  Programs being implemented by these </p><p>organizations are likely not in a position to support </p><p>emergency humanitarian response contingency planning in </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p>C)    The International Rescue Committee (IRC) submitted a </p><p>transit and registration application to the MFA on March 10, </p><p>2003.  The process is expected to take two to three weeks for </p><p>a transit permit. </p><p>D) Three NGOs (International Medical Corps (IMC), and </p><p>Northwest Medical Team, and Save the Children/USA) are in </p><p>Ankara to submit applications for  transit registration, so </p><p>that they can move personnel and supplies through Turkey to </p><p>northern Iraq.  Indications are that all four organizations </p><p>will submit their applications to the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs (MFA) the week of March 10-15.  "Reftel A" </p><p>D)    WFP is the only UN Agency considering cross-border </p><p>operations.  WFP,s contingency plan calls for more than </p><p>100,000 metric tons (MT) of emergency food assistance to </p><p>arrive in Iraq via Turkey per month; however, WFP currently </p><p>does not have registration status with the GOT and is working </p><p>under UNDP,s umbrella at present.  WFP submitted their </p><p>transit application on February 28 and is hoping to have an </p><p>official transit license in the next two weeks. </p><p>E)    IFRC will not participate in cross-border operations, </p><p>but will assist Kizilay in humanitarian response in Turkey. </p><p>F)    ICRC will have a liaison office in Ankara, but are not </p><p>planning cross-border operations due to difficulties in </p><p>acquiring permission from the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kizilay and GOT are setting up a coordination office </p><p>in Diyarbakir and an operation office in Silopi.  Kizilay and </p><p>GOT representation in Diyarbakir will provide overall </p><p>coordination and report back to Ankara.  The Silopi operation </p><p>office will coordinate locally at the camp level and oversee </p><p>the distribution of supplies and personnel as needed. </p><p>Currently, there are no NGOs involved in either the operation </p><p>center in Silopi or coordination office in Diyarbakir.  U.N. </p><p>agencies based in Ankara are considering sending liaison </p><p>officers to the coordination office in Diyarbakir, but will </p><p>concentrate on needs in Turkey. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Constraints on Delivering Humanitarian Assistance Through </p><p>Turkey </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>5. (C) Beginning February 27, the Silopi border crossing </p><p>(Habur Gate) was closed to all trucks going to </p><p>Kurdish-controlled areas of Iraq, while trucks going to Mosul </p><p>or further south were allowed to continue crossing the </p><p>border.  Forty-one World Food Program (WFP) trucks traveling </p><p>to Kurdish-controlled (KDP and PUK) areas in northern Iraq, </p><p>carrying high protein biscuits, vegetable oil, and chickpeas, </p><p>were unable to cross the Turkish-Iraqi border since February </p><p>27.  The WFP food is for its program in Iraq, which supports </p><p>school feeding and nutritional programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Subsequent information provided by WFP indicated that </p><p>10 commercial trucks, including four WFP contracted vehicles, </p><p>were able to cross the border on March 7.  However, at this </p><p>time, all vehicles with papers indicating that they are </p><p>transporting supplies to Kurdish-controlled areas of northern </p><p>Iraq are being offloaded and searched before gaining entry </p><p>through the Habur Gate.  Speculation in Silopi on March 4 was </p><p>that the border was closed because Turkish Customs officials </p><p>found a commercial truck, not associated with WFP, trying to </p><p>bring weapons across the border. Note: The border closing </p><p>coincided with the Turkish military taking up positions near </p><p>the border crossing. EndNote Prior to February 27, more than </p><p>100 trucks crossed the border at Habur Gate daily bound for </p><p>Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Role for the DART Field Office/North </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (SBU)Key International Organizations and UN agencies, such </p><p>as ICRC, UN OCHA, WFP, UN JLC, UNHCR, and UNICEF, as well as </p><p>several international NGOs, are in country and provide </p><p>valuable information on humanitarian contingency plans. </p><p>Discussing and identifying humanitarian contingency options </p><p>with these organizations remains important. </p><p>8. (SBU) Indications from the MFA on the NGO transit and </p><p>registration issue are encouraging.  Positive indications </p><p>from the MFA in the near future regarding the submission of </p><p> transit applications,, such as IRC,s submission on March </p><p>10, are critical to supporting international humanitarian </p><p>operations in northern Iraq. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
