<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR IO, AF/RA AND AF/C </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KPAO, NI, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UN CHR-59 COUNTRY PROFILE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 252917 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by CDA: ANDREWS: Reason: 1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Nigeria\'s interests in the Human Rights Commission are </p><p>conflicting.  Nigeria wants to maintain a position of </p><p>leadership among the developing nations.  It is very </p><p>sensitive to the G-77 views and most especially those of the </p><p>Africa Group.  In this vein, another Nigerian tradition has </p><p>been to oppose country-specific resolutions on human rights. </p><p>Given expected flaws in the conduct of the 2003 elections, </p><p>the negative attention caused by Sharia and the lack of </p><p>accountability for the killings at Odi and Zaki Biam, Nigeria </p><p>will be very hesitant to support strong country-specific </p><p>resolutions out of fear that it also might someday be a </p><p>target of such a resolution.  While Nigeria\'s adherence to </p><p>these positions is usually very strong, it is not completely </p><p>unshakeable.  Nigeria realizes that the level of Western </p><p>donor support for NePAD hinges on good governance and human </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) NePAD notwithstanding, Nigerian diplomacy will tend to </p><p>hew its traditional line.  A change in course on a major </p><p>issue would require a decision by President Obasanjo.  While </p><p>some issues might be worked through the Foreign Ministry, </p><p>Foreign Minister Sule Lamido and his pugnacious Number Two, </p><p>Minister of State Dubem Onyia, are less flexible than the </p><p>Presidency regarding GON adherence to G-77 and African </p><p>solidarity.  On matters that Nigeria believes it can vote </p><p>with us but not risk its leadership position in Africa, it </p><p>may exercise greater flexibility and USG intervention could </p><p>possibly be persuasive in pushing Nigeria to abstain on a </p><p>vote it ordinarily would not have supported.  However, on </p><p>hot-button issues such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria is unlikely to </p><p>deviate from the Africa/G-77 norm, no matter how hard we </p><p>push.  The Nigerian line on Cuba will be that Cuba, like the </p><p>U.S., is a "friendly" country with which Nigeria has long </p><p>enjoyed good relations.  In fact, a strong USG push on some </p><p>issues, particularly Zimb </p><p>abwe, could be counterproductive, encouraging Nigeria to </p><p>engage actively in opposition to the U.S. in order to </p><p>demonstrate its "independence" from "Western interference." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The answers to questions in para four of reftel </p><p>follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) The Nigerian representatives in Geneva make most decisions </p><p>based on prior voting record and general instructions. </p><p>Changes on relatively minor issues could be decided by the </p><p>MFA.  Any change on a major topic would be the result of a </p><p>Presidential decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b) Name and contact information: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Ad\'Obe Obe </p><p>The President\'s Special Assistant for International Affairs </p><p>White House, Abuja </p><p>243-9-314-0285 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c) Nigeria will not want Sharia criminal punishments in </p><p>Nigeria nor the Odi and Zaki Biam massacres to be raised. </p><p>Nigeria will likely oppose a strong resolution against </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d) Our USAID program and our military assistance programs are </p><p>among the largest in Africa.  However, they offer little </p><p>leverage on the GON in the UNHCR. On issues of cardinal </p><p>importance, direct discussion between POTUS or Secretary </p><p>Powell and President Obasanjo would provide the most </p><p>effective chance to influence the Nigerian position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e) With the cancellation of the POTUS visit, our major </p><p>opportunity for lobbying has been removed.  Given that the </p><p>GON will be increasingly preoccupied with the 2003 elections </p><p>during the first quarter of the year, there will be very few </p><p>other significant lobbying opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f) As no important changes in traditional voting will occur </p><p>without the President\'s direct authority, public diplomacy </p><p>outreach within Nigeria is likely to have little effect. </p><p>Quite the contrary, in certain cases (such as Zimbabwe), it </p><p>would likely be counterproductive. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
