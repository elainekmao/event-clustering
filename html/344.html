<p>UNCLAS STATE 048186 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AF/P: INFORM CONSULS AND PAOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: AFRICA IN THE U.S. PRESS - FEBRUARY 13, 1990 </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS PLEASE PASS USEC </p><p>CAPE TOWN FOR EMBASSY </p><p>NAIROBI PLEASE PASS MOMBASA </p><p>RIYADH ALSO FOR AMB. FREEMAN </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR VATICAN </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THE NEW YORK TIMES </p><p></p><p>IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT, THE NELSON MANDELA WHO WALKED OUT </p><p>OF VICTOR VERSTER PRISON FARM SUNDAY MORNING APPEARED TO </p><p>RESEMBLE CLOSELY THE IMPRESSIVE FIGURE DESCRIBED IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS BY THE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO VISITED HIM IN PRISON, </p><p>JOHN BURNS WRITES.  BECAUSE THOSE VISITORS HAD DESCRIBED </p><p>MANDELA IN GLOWING TERMS - A MAN OF UNUSUAL MEMORY AND </p><p>GREAT PERSONAL WARMTH, EVEN TOWARD HIS CAPTORS, REPORTERS </p><p>WAITING TO SEE HIM ON SUNDAY WERE WATCHING FOR FEET OF </p><p>CLAY.  BUT THERE WERE FEW WHO SAID THEY FOUND THEM. </p><p>ADDRESSING A PRESS CONFERENCE IN ARCHBISHOP TUTU\'S CAPE </p><p>TOWN GARDEN ON MONDAY, MANDELA APPEARED MODEST, </p><p>SOFT-SPOKEN, ANALYTICAL YET GENEROUS IN HIS POLITICAL </p><p>OBSERVATIONS AND FRIENDLY.  EVEN THOUGH HIS NEWSPAPERS AND </p><p>MAGAZINES WERE HEAVILY CENSORED UNTIL THE MID-1980S, HE </p><p>SHOWED A BROAD GRASP OF EVENTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA.  IN MONDAY\'S PRESS CONFERENCE, HE DESCRIBED SOME OF </p><p>HIS CAPTORS AS GOOD MEN.  "THAT HAS WIPED OUT ANY </p><p>BITTERNESS A MAN COULD HAVE," HE SAID.  P. A17; </p><p></p><p>BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS IN THE NEW YORK AREA SAID IN </p><p>INTERVIEWS YESTERDAY THAT THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA </p><p>IMPROVED THE PROSPECTS FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SAG AND </p><p>THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT, ERIC PACE REPORTS.  SOME SAID </p><p>THAT MANDELA\'S RETURN TO THE POLITICAL SCENE WOULD INCREASE </p><p>COHESIVENESS WITHIN THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT.  OTHERS </p><p>INTERPRETED THE RELEASE AS ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE SAG OF THE </p><p>STRENGTH AND PIVOTAL ROLE OF THE ANC.  SELOKA PHIRWA, A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE ANC\'S OBSERVER MISSION TO THE UN AND OTHERS, </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE RELEASE OF MANDELA WAS A "BOLD STEP," OTHER </p><p>CONDITIONS SET BY THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SAG "REMAINED UNFILLED."  THE LABOR </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE PAC, LESOANA MAKHANDA, SAID MANDELA WAS </p><p>BEING RELEAED "MERELY INTO A LARGER JAIL, WHICH IS THE REST </p><p>OF SOUTH AFRICA."  P. A17; </p><p></p><p>WHILE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA CELEBRATED THE </p><p>RELEASE OF MANDELA, THE QUESTION RAISED BY SUPPORTERS AND </p><p>OPPONENTS ALIKE IS WHETHER PRESIDENT DE KLERK, IN FREEING </p><p>MANDELA, HAS UNLEASED A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT HE WILL NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO CONTROL.  PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHETHER DE KLERK </p><p>WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE GORBACHEV OF SOUTH AFRICA, A </p><p>REFORMER WHO SETS OUT ON A MODEST COURSE OF CHANGE ONLY TO </p><p>FIND THAT HE HAS UNCAGED FORCES THAT MOVE THROUGH SOCIETY </p><p>IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS, FORCES THAT EVEN THREATEN TO </p><p>OVERWHELM HIM.  WHILE CP LEADER ANDRIES TREURNICHT TALKED </p><p>OF THE SAG HAVING SURRENDERED TO A MARXIST REVOLUTION, </p><p>MODERATES AMONG WHITES AND BLACKS AGREED THAT THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA OF YESTERDAY, IN WHICH WHITES DECREED FOR BLACKS, IS </p><p>ALMOST SURELY GONE FOREVER.  THE LIBERAL "WEEKLY MAIL" </p><p>SAID:  "IF THE GOVERNMENT STILL BELIEVES IT CAN CONTROL THE </p><p>PROCESS IT HAS STARTED, IT IS KIDDING ITSELF."  JOHN BURNS </p><p>REPORTS.  P. A16; </p><p></p><p>AN EDITORIAL, "SUNRISE IN SOUTH AFRICA," STATES THAT THE </p><p>JAIL THAT OPENED SUNDAY FOR NELSON MANDELA "BEGAN TO FREE A </p><p>NATION EVEN AS IT FREED A MAN."  MANDELA ROSE TO A </p><p>"REMARKABLE OCCASION:"  HE PRAISED HIS FOLLOWERS FOR THEIR </p><p>STEADFASTNESS, BUT REMINDED THEM THAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES </p><p>HAD TO BE RESPECTED; HE PRAISED F.W. DE KLERK AS "A MAN OF </p><p>INTEGRITY; HE DEFENDED THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT ALSO SAID HE </p><p>HOPED A NEW CLIMATE WOULD END THE NEED FOR A "DEFENSIVE" </p><p>RESPONSE.  THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO SAY THAT GLOBAL </p><p>SANCTIONS HAVE HASTENED REFORMS, INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF </p><p>MANDELA AND THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC.  "THESE STEPS ARE A </p><p>VINDICATION OF SANCTIONS, NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR REPEALING </p><p>THEM."  AT THE SAME TIME, THE EDITORIAL SAYS BUSH HAS TAKEN </p><p>"THE RIGHT FIRST STEP" IN INVITING BOTH DE KLERK AND </p><p>MANDELA TO WASHINGTON AND THAT "IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO EASE </p><p>SOME PENALTIES AS PRETORIA MOVES FORWARD, THEREBY PROVIDING </p><p>INCENTIVES FOR FURTHER CHANGE WHILE KEEPING THE LEGISLATION </p><p>IN FORCE."  WHILE CONCEDING THE SAG STILL HAS TO TAKE OTHER </p><p>STEPS TO CREATE A CLIMATE FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT IT </p><p>WON\'T BE EASY TO MESH THE GOALS OF THE SAG AND THE </p><p>ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT, EVEN AFTER NEGOTIATIONS HAVE </p><p>BEGUN, THE EDITORIAL ENDS ON AN UPBEAT NOTE:  "IN CAPE TOWN </p><p>AS ELSEWHERE . . . THE UNTHINKABLE HAS BECOME IMAGINABLE </p><p>AND A STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BEGUN BY NAMELESS ORDINARY </p><p>PEOPLE HAS FOUND CHAMPIONS IN LEADERS LIKE MIKHAIL </p><p>GORBACHEV, LECH WELESA, VACLEV HAVEL, F.W. DE KLERK AND, </p><p>NOW, NELSON MANDELA."  P. A24; </p><p></p><p>IN AN OP-ED PIECE, TONY LEWIS WRITES OF MANDELA\'S WALK TO </p><p>FREEDOM:  "NOT MANY EVENTS IN THE WORLD HAVE SUCH SYMBOLIC </p><p>EMOTIONAL POWER."  MANDELA\'S SURVIVAL OF 27 YEARS IN PRISON </p><p>IS TESTIMONY "THAT HIS CAUSE - NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA - COULD NOT BE CRUSHED."  THE ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>RESPONSE OF SOUTH AFRICANS TO A FREE MANDELA IS AN </p><p>EXPRESSION OF A REALITY THE SAG HAS TRIED TO SUPPRESS FOR </p><p>MANY YEARS:  "THAT BLACKS, 75 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, </p><p>WANT TO HAVE THEIR PART IN RUNNING THE COUNTRY."  LEWIS </p><p>GOES ON TO SAY THAT DE KLERK MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>ENORMOUS EMOTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS WHICH WOULD BE AROUSED </p><p>BY MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND HE MUST BE CREDITED WITH "RARE </p><p>COURAGE."  WHILE THERE ARE STILL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING </p><p>THE RESISTANCE OF RIGHT-WING WHITES TO ANY CHANGE, THE </p><p>REACTION OF WHITES - FROM THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SABC TO </p><p>PIK BOTHA AND WHITES IN SUNDAY\'S CROWD ON THE ROAD TO CAPE </p><p>TOWN - HAS BEEN "SURPRISINGLY FRIENDLY" TO MANDELA.  LEWIS </p><p>CONCLUDES THAT INSTEAD OF DWELLING ON APARTHEID\'S PAST </p><p>EVILS, "IT IS BETTER TO THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES </p><p>AHEAD.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE A NEW SOUTH AFRICA COULD MAKE TO </p><p>ITSELF AND ITS CONTINENT."  P. A25; </p><p></p><p>AP REPORTS PLATINUM FUTURES PRICES JUMPED YESTERDAY AFTER </p><p>NELSON MANDELA ENDORSED ANTI-APARTHEID VIOLENCE AND </p><p>NATIONALIZATION OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S MINING INDUSTRY, SENDING </p><p>FEAR ABOUT SUPPLIES THROUGH THE PRECIOUS METALS MARKETS. </p><p>BERNARD SAVAIKO, SENIOR METALS ANALYST AT PAINE WEBBER </p><p>INC., SAID MINE SABOTAGE POSES OBVIOUS PRODUCTION PROBLEMS, </p><p>WHILE THE ANC\'S CALL FOR NATIONALIZATION OF THE MINES </p><p>"LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FLOW OF SUPPLY WILL </p><p>DIMINISH BECAUSE OF THE INEFFICIENCIES OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>MINING OPERATIONS AS OPPOSED TO THOSE CONTROLLED BY FREE </p><p>ENTERPRISE."  SOUTH AFRICA IS THE WORLD\'S LARGEST PRODUCER </p><p>OF PLATINUM AND GOLD.  P. D17; </p><p></p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORLD\'S 42 POOREST NATIONS MET IN </p><p>DHAKA, BANGLADESH OVER THE WEEKEND TO DEVISE NEW WAYS TO </p><p>CONVINCE RICHER COUNTRIES THAT NEARLY HALF A BILLION PEOPLE </p><p>NEED HELP DESPERATELY.  THIS FIRST MINISTERIAL MEETING OF </p><p>LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IS EXPECTED TO RESTATE FORCEFULLY </p><p>A PLEA THAT AID DONORS AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING </p><p>ORGANIZATINS TREAT THE POOREST NATIONS SEPARATELY FROM THE </p><p>REST OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THE GROUP OF 42 - OF WHICH </p><p>28 ARE IN AFRICA - WILL MEET WITH DONOR NATIONS IN GENEVA </p><p>AT THE END OF MARCH IN PREPARATION FOR A LARGER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN PARIS IN SEPTEMBER ON THE </p><p>PLIGHT OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COUNTRIES.  BARBARA </p><p>CROSSETTE REPORTS.  P. A3; </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL </p><p></p><p>IN A LENGTHY ANALYSIS WRITTEN FROM THE ERITREAN FRONT, </p><p>GERALDINE BROOKS WRITES THAT THE STRUGGLE IN ERITREA, AFTER </p><p>28 YEARS, MAY BE NEAR A CLIMAX.  OPPOSING BLACK AFRICA\'S </p><p>BEST-EQUIPPED ARMY, THAT OF ETHIOPIA, EPLF GUERRILLAS SEEK </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FOR AN ENGLAND-SIZE STRIP OF RED SEA COAST </p><p>THAT IS HOME TO 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE.  ETHIOPIA ANNEXED IT IN </p><p>1962.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR IT EVER </p><p>SINCE.  A RAPID STRING OF GUERRILLA VICTORIES FORCED THE </p><p>GPDRE INTO PEACE TALKS MEDIATED BY JIMMY CARTER LAST FALL. </p><p>IN THE PAST WEEK, THE EPLF ADVANCED AGAIN IN FIERCE </p><p>FIGHTING AROUND THE RED SEA PORT OF MASSAWA.  THEY CLAIM TO </p><p>HAVE CAPTURED THE PORT, WHILE THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMNENT </p><p>ONLY SAYS THAT HEAVY FIGHTING AT THE PORT CONTINUES.  AN </p><p>ERITREAN VICTORY WOULD CULMINATE A STRUGGLE IN AFRICA\'S </p><p>LONGEST WAR, BUT IT WOULD BE A VICTORY THAT HARDLY ANY OF </p><p>ERITREA\'S NEIGHBORS SEEM TO DESIRE.  AFRICAN NATIONS WORRY </p><p>THAT ONE SECESSIONIST VICTORY WOULD PUT THE WHOLE </p><p>CONTINENT\'S MAP AT RISK.  ISRAEL PREFERS THE PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT TO THE ARAB ENCIRCLEMENT IT </p><p>FEARS WOULD FOLLOW A WIN BY PARTLY MOSLEM ERITREA.  WAR AND </p><p>PERIODIC FAMINE NOTWITHSTANDING, THE ERITREANS HAVE MANAGED </p><p>TO BUILD A COMPLEX SOCIETY ON THEIR CAPTURED LAND. </p><p>SPENDING TWO WEEKS WITH THE EPLF, BROOKS SAW AN UNDERGROUND </p><p>MOVEMENT THAT IS LITERALLY THAT:  SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, </p><p>FACTORIES AND "GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS" ARE GOUGED OUT OF </p><p>ROCK OR BUILT IN EARTHEN TUNNELS TO HIDE FROM THE ENEMY\'S </p><p>MIGS.  THE EPLF\'S LEADER, ISAIS AFEWERKE, CLAIMS THE </p><p>MOVEMENT IS NOT "MARXIST."  "THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE DO </p><p>COLLECTIVELY, NOT BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE THAT WAY BUT </p><p>BECAUSE WE DON\'T HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE," HE SAYS.  P. A1; </p><p></p><p>AN EDITORIAL ASSERTS THAT WITH MANDELA\'S WALK TO FREEDOM, </p><p>"THE LEGEND ENDS AND THE HUMAN BEING COMES OUT."  MANDELA\'S </p><p>FIRST SPEECH IN CAPE TOWN, THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO SAY, </p><p>FAILED TO REASSURE NON-ANC MEMBERS THAT HE WANTS </p><p>RECONCILIATION WITH ALL SOUTH AFRICANS.  HE FAILED TO </p><p>MENTION ANY MODERATE BLACKS SUCH AS CHIEF BUTHELEZI, </p><p>PROMISED TO CONTINUE THE "ARMED STRUGGLE" AND PRAISED THE </p><p>SACP.  HE ALSO OPENED AND CLOSED HIS SPEECH IN XHOSA, THE </p><p>LANGUAGE OF THE ANC\'S DOMINANT ETHNIC GROUP.  THE EDITORIAL </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT MANDELA WILL NEED TIME TO EVALUATE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN TODAY\'S SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH HAS CHANGED </p><p>CONSIDERABLY IN THE YEARS HE WAS IN PRISON.  NOTING </p><p>ECONOMIC PROGRESS BY BLACKS - 57 PERCENT OF ALL HOUSING </p><p>PERMITS LAST YEAR WENT TO BLACKS, FOR EXAMPLE - THE </p><p>EDITORIAL ASSERTS THAT THIS "SILENT REVOLUTION HAS NOT ONLY </p><p>BEEN EFFECTIVE IN UNDERMINING APARTHEID, BUT HAS ALSO LED </p><p>MANY BLACKS TO REVIEW THEIR POLITICS.  "THE ANC\'S MOST </p><p>RADICAL ELEMENTS MAY FIND LESS SUPPORT FOR SOCIALISM IN THE </p><p>TOWNSHIPS THAN THEY EXPECT."  IF MANDELA DOES NOT TAKE THIS </p><p>INTO ACCOUNT, HE COULD FIND DIFFICULTY IN PURSUING THE </p><p>ANC\'S AGENDA.  THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDES:  "THE ANC HAS </p><p>ALWAYS ACTED AS IF NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AROUND A </p><p>SQUARE TABLE WITH TWO CHAIRS, ONE FOR THE ANC AND ONE FOR </p><p>THE WHITES.  THE SOONER BOTH SIDES REALIZE THAT A ROUND </p><p>TABLE WITH CHAIRS REPRESENTING MANY INTERESTS WILL BE </p><p>NEEDED, THE MORE SMOOTHLY A TRANSITION TO A POST-APARTHEID </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA IS LIKELY TO GO."  P. A20; </p><p></p><p>INTERNATIONAL AID DONORS PLEDGED 27 MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP </p><p>AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR BUSINESSES OFF THE GROUND. </p><p>THE AFRICA PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILITY SAID AFTER A </p><p>MEETING WITH 14 WESTERN DONOR NATIONS AT THE WORLD BANK </p><p>THAT IT AIMED TO FIND MORE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FIVE YEARS.  P. A16; </p><p></p><p> </p><p>WASHINGTON POST </p><p></p><p>NELSON MANDELA TOOK A CONCILIATORY TONE TOWARD WHITE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS IN A FIFTY MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>RELEASE.  HE SAID THAT HE WANTED WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS WHO </p><p>FEAR FOR THEIR SECURITY TO FEEL SAFE ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF </p><p>BLACK-MAJORITY RULE, AND HE PREDICTED THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON </p><p>THE NATION\'S POLITICAL FUTURE WOULD BEGIN SOON.  HE ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE ANC MIGHT STOP ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IF </p><p>PRETORIA ENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND AGREED TO OTHER </p><p>CONCESSIONS.  BUT EVEN AS HE TRIED TO CALM WHITES\' FEARS, </p><p>HE DECLARED SUPPORT YESTERDAY FOR NATIONALIZATION OF KEY </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIES, SETTING OFF CONCERN IN THE </p><p>BUSINESS WORLD.  GOLD PRICES FELL 4 PERCENT ON THE </p><p>JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE FINANCIAL RAND </p><p>PLUMMETED 10 PERCENT.  VIOLENCE, FOLLOWING MANDELA\'S </p><p>RELEASE, WAS UP SHARPLY.  POLICE REPORTED 40 PEOPLE KILLED </p><p>AND SCORES INJURED SINCE SUNDAY, INCLUDING 10 SHOT WHEN </p><p>POLICE OPENED FIRE ON LOOTERS WHO BROKE AWAY FROM </p><p>CELEBRATING CROWDS NEAR EAST LONDON ON SUNDAY.  IN CAPE </p><p>TOWN, MANDELA FIELDED QUESTIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESS CORPS.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN "ABSOLUTELY SURPRISED" TO </p><p>SEE SO MANY WHITES WELCOMING HIM SUNDAY ON THE SHORT DRIVE </p><p>FROM THE PRISON INTO CAPE TOWN AND HE STRESSED THAT IF THE </p><p>NATION\'S 25 MILLION BLACK MAJORITY ASSUMES POWER, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S 5 MILLION WHITES NEED HAVE NO FEARS FOR THEIR </p><p>FUTURE.  "THE ANC IS VERY MUCH CONCERNED TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>QUESTION OF THE CONCERN OF WHITES OVER THE (BLACK) DEMAND </p><p>OF ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE," HE SAID.  "THEY INSIST ON </p><p>STRUCTURAL GUARANTEES TO ENSURE THAT THE REALIZATION OF </p><p>THIS DEMAND DOES NOT RESULT IN THE DOMINATION OF WHITES BY </p><p>BLACKS.  WE UNDERSTAND THOSE FEELINGS, AND THE ANC IS </p><p>CONCERNED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND TO FIND A SOLUTION </p><p>WHICH WILL SUIT BOTH THE BLACKS AND WHITES OF THIS </p><p>COUNTRY."  MANDELA HINTED THAT THE ANC IS CONSIDERING SOME </p><p>RECIPROCAL MOVE FOLLOWING DE KLERK\'S ACTIONS, BUT HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THIS COULD OCCUR ONLY IF THE GOVERNMENT ENDS </p><p>THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND RELEASES ALL POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS.  HE REPEATED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE ANC\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE MINES AND SIMILAR </p><p>SECTORS.  WHEN PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE WAS A COMMUNIST, </p><p>MANDELA REPLIED, "LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.  I DO NOT BELONG TO </p><p>ANY PARTY APART FROM THE ANC."  DAVID OTTAWAY REPORTS.  P. </p><p>1; NYT. P. 1; CSM P. 1;  W.T.  P. A1; </p><p></p><p>ON MANDELA\'S RELEASE, MARY MCGRORY WRITES, "IN A SEASON OF </p><p>STUNNING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, THE RELEASE OF NELSON </p><p>MANDELA WAS IN A CLASS BY ITSELF, PARTAKING OF THE FALL OF </p><p>THE BERLIN WALL AND THE SOVIET CEDING OF MONOPOLY POWER. </p><p>MOST SPECTATORS AT THE GALLOPING HISTORY WE GET THESE DAYS </p><p>EXPECTED SOUTH AFRICA TO BE THE LAST TO CHANGE OR GIVE UP </p><p>ITS TITLE FOR INTRACTABILITY TO ISRAEL OR NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND."  MCGRORY CREDITS GIL KULICK OF THE CARNEGIE </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR BEING ONE OF THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE DE </p><p>KLERK\'S SINCERITY IN WANTING "A NEW AFRICA."  P. 2; </p><p></p><p>IN AN EDITORIAL, THE POST EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT NELSON </p><p>MANDELA\'S TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p>THE EDITORIAL ASKS WHY COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS STILL </p><p>DOMINATE THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE ANC AND WHY THEY </p><p>EVIDENTLY ALSO HAVE A STRONG POSITION IN THE MASS </p><p>DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT.  THE POST URGES THE ANC "TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE BLACK LEADERSHIP IS NOT CAPTURED OR INFLUENCED BY </p><p>A PARTY THAT IS A RELIC OF A CONSPIRATORIAL PAST."  P. 20; </p><p></p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH INDICATED YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL NOT ASK </p><p>CONGRESS TO CONSIDER LIFTING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA IN RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA, </p><p>BUT HE ADDED THAT SOME OF THE SANCTIONS ARE </p><p>"COUNTERPRODUCTIVE."  AT A WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE DEVOTED </p><p>ALMOST ENTIRELY TO SOUTH AFRICA AND EAST-WEST RELATIONS, </p><p>BUSH SAID MANDELA\'S RELEASE WAS A "DRAMATIC SIGN" THAT </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA IS MOVING TOWARD A MORE RACIALLY EQUITABLE </p><p>SOCIETY.  ON SANCTIONS, THE PRESIDENT CITED THE CAAA AND </p><p>SAID "I AM BOUND BY THE LAW...THE SANCTIONS REMAIN ON UNTIL </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE TAKEN CERTAIN (OTHER) STEPS" TOWARD </p><p>RACIAL EQUALITY.  IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW, HANK COHEN </p><p>SAID THAT U.S. SANCTIONS PLAYED ONLY A SMALL ROLE IN </p><p>MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND THAT SOME "GESTURE" SHOULD BE MADE TO </p><p>DE KLERK.  "WHAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT IS ENCOURAGING </p><p>FURTHER PROGRESS....IF THAT MEANS RELAXATION OF SANCTIONS, </p><p>FINE."  ANN DEVROY REPORTS.  P. 14;  BALT. SUN  P. A1; </p><p>W.T.  P.

THE WINDOWS OF JACKSON\'S </p><p>MERCEDES WERE BROKEN AND THE ROOF CAVED IN AS CROWDS </p><p>SWARMED OVER THE CAR MISTAKING HIM FOR MANDELA.  JACKSON </p><p>WAS WAITING INSIDE CITY HALL WITH A SMALL GROUP OF SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN CIVIC AND CHURCH LEADERS WHEN MANDELA ARRIVED TO </p><p>GIVE HIS FIRST SPEECH.  JACKSON, WHO\'S VISIT HAS BEEN </p><p>LARGELY OVERSHADOWED BY MANDELA\'S RELEASE, HAS BEEN URGING </p><p>BLACK OPPOSITION GROUPS TO STRIVE FOR UNITY AMONG </p><p>THEMSELVES.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS CONVINCED AFTER MEETING </p><p>WITH DE KLERK THAT THE PRESIDENT INTENDS TO "HONOR HIS </p><p>WORD" AND CONTINUE HIS REFORMS.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAD A </p><p>SENSE THAT DE KLERK WOULD LIFT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>SHORTLY.  DAVID OTTAWAY REPORTS.  P. 14; </p><p></p><p>NELSON MANDELA AGREED TO SPEND LAST NIGHT AT AN UNDISCLOSED </p><p>SITE NORTH OF JOHANNESBURG AFTER THE COMMITTEE OF BLACK </p><p>LEADERS HANDLING HIS SCHEDULE DECIDED THAT THE HUGE CROWDS </p><p>OF BOISTEROUS PEOPLE WAITING TO WELCOME HIM BACK TO HIS </p><p>HOME POSED A THREAT TO HIS SAFETY.  FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT </p><p>DAY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE POURED INTO THE STREETS TO </p><p>CHEER AND DANCE IN CELEBRATION, WHILE TWO STADIUMS, WHERE </p><p>MANDELA WAS SCHEDULED TO APPEAR, WERE SWAMPED BY </p><p>UNMANAGEABLE CROWDS.

"LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WE\'VE BEEN </p><p>CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED BY MR. DE KLERK\'S BOLDNESS.  AS SO OFTEN </p><p>IN OUR DEALINGS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, WE FIND OURSELVES </p><p>TONGUE-TIED."  HIS QUESTIONS ARE DO WE APPLAUD HIM FOR WHAT </p><p>HE\'S DONE OR DO WE CONDEMN HIM FOR WHAT HE HASN\'T DONE?  DO </p><p>WE CHEER OR SIT ON OUR HANDS?  MATTHEWS SAYS WE HAVE </p><p>ALIENATED WHITES WITH OUR LIMITED SANCTIONS AND UNLIMITED </p><p>MORAL POSTURING.  WE\'VE TURNED OFF BLACKS BY "KEEPING OUR </p><p>IDEALS IN THE BACK OF THE BUS WHILE SITTING OUR INTERESTS </p><p>UP FRONT."

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF  DISADVANTAGES FACING </p><p>MANDELA.  UNTIL 5-6 YEARS AGO, MANDELA WAS AN OBSCURE </p><p>OPERATIVE OF AN UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.  HIS </p><p>CAPACITIES FOR REAL LEADERSHIP REMAIN COMPLETELY UNTESTED. </p><p>AMONG THE FACTORS WORKING AGAINST MANDELA ARE HIS AGE, THE </p><p>FACTIONALISM WITHIN THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT ITSELF, AND </p><p>MANDELA\'S ABSENCE FROM THE SOCIETY FOR 27 YEARS.  QUESTIONS </p><p>TO BE ASKED ARE:  HOW WEDDED IS MANDELA TO THE MARXIST </p><p>IDEOLOGY, WHAT DID HE MEAN WHEN HE CALLED FOR "A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THE INEQUALITIES OF APARTHEID ARE </p><p>ADDRESSED?"  THE EDITORIAL URGES MANDELA TO TAKE A LONG </p><p>VACATION INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA AND SEE WHAT IS REALLY </p><p>HAPPENING IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE </p><p>1964.  "IF MANDELA CLINGS TO THE LEFTIST ORTHODOXY HE HELD </p><p>27 YEARS AGO, SOUTH AFRICAN BLACKS MAY BE FORCED TO TRADE </p><p>THE OLD SHACKLES OF APARTHEID FOR NEW SHACKLES OF SOCIALIST </p><p>POVERTY."

THE QUESTION </p><p>CONFRONTING THE U.S. IS SHOULD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION </p><p>CONSIDER LIFTING SANCTIONS AS A SIGN OF ENCOURAGEMENT OR </p><p>SHOULD THE U.S. WEIGH THE IDEA OF TOUGHER NEW SANCTIONS TO </p><p>KEEP THE PRESSURE ON, AS ANTI-APARTHEID ACTIVISTS WITHIN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA ARE PROPOSING?  NEITHER APPROACH WOULD BE </p><p>APPROPRIATE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME.

BUT, THE L986 </p><p>LAW LISTS FIVE CONDITIONS THE SAG MUST MEET BEFORE THE U.S. </p><p>CAN LIFT SANCTIONS.  THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN </p><p>MET.
