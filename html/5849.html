<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W </p><p>STATE PASS OPIC, TDA, AND EX-IM </p><p>STATE PASS USTR AND DOT </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EAGR, ELTN, EPET, EIND, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP FEBRUARY 20 </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report from Abuja and Lagos </p><p>includes: </p><p>--Canned Beer and Soda Coming Soon to Nigeria </p><p>--Nigeria\'s Juice Ban Squeezes Out U.S. Exports </p><p>--Trucks Roll Only at Night in Port Harcourt </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Canned Beer and Soda Coming Soon to Nigeria </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and Brewtech </p><p>Nigeria signed a $251,000 grant agreement January 23 in Abuja </p><p>to fund a feasibility study on the construction of an </p><p>aluminum can manufacturing facility in Lagos State. Roeslein </p><p>and Associates, in conjunction with Ball Packaging, will </p><p>conduct the study. The USTDA grant will partially fund the </p><p>cost of the study, with Roeslein and Associates providing an </p><p>additional $166,320 to complete the total project. This early </p><p>planning assistance will provide a full assessment of the </p><p>current economic, financial, and environmental conditions for </p><p>the construction of a can production line in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Currently, Nigeria imports cans from South Africa. </p><p>However, South Africa is reaching its capacity and has been </p><p>unable to supply a sufficient amount of cans to the Nigerian </p><p>fillers, including Coca-Cola, Vita-Malt and Nigerian </p><p>Breweries. When fully implemented, the project could lead to </p><p>hundreds of new jobs in can manufacturing, filling processes, </p><p>and logistics management. In addition, it could stimulate </p><p>exports of $32 million in U.S. goods and services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria\'s Juice Ban Squeezes Out U.S. Exports </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>4. Information Minister Jerry Gana announced on January 29 </p><p>that Nigeria\'s Federal Cabinet had banned the import of fruit </p><p>juices in retail packs effective immediately. Gana continued, </p><p>"Juices to be imported into the country must be in drums and </p><p>must be processed in the country to generate income and </p><p>employment. Packaged fruit juices imported into the country </p><p>will be destroyed at the point of entry unless the </p><p>consignment is in drums." Industry sources indicate that the </p><p>ban is to protect local production and a few importers of </p><p>juice concentrates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Nigeria\'s overall import figures are not readily </p><p>available; however, import demand increased markedly over the </p><p>past four years. The ban has cut off growing U.S. exports of </p><p>fruit juices to Nigeria which reached a record level of </p><p>$304,000 (U.S. trade data) last fiscal year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trucks Roll Only at Night in Port Harcourt </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>6. A new Rivers State law restricts the movement of trucks to </p><p>night hours. Effective February 1, 2003, Heavy Goods Vehicles </p><p>(HGV), including all trucks and trucks with trailers, are </p><p>allowed on the state\'s roadways only between 2100 and 0600. </p><p>The measure is aimed at easing congestion, reducing accidents </p><p>and, according to the government circular, to "bring back </p><p>sanity to our roads and streets." One major shipping company </p><p>reports that police are stopping and arresting drivers of </p><p>trucks traveling in daylight hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. This concept is not new to Nigeria; under the Buhari </p><p>regime, truck traffic in and around Lagos was restricted to </p><p>the hours of midnight to 0600 with some success, but the </p><p>policy was abandoned when Ibrahim Babangida came to power in </p><p>1985. A source in the shipping industry believes the </p><p>restriction will be loosened and companies will be able to </p><p>obtain decals allowing them to drive trucks during daylight </p><p>hours upon the payment of special fees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment: The Port Harcourt area of Rivers State has long </p><p>suffered acute road congestion, particularly at Eleme or </p><p>"Refinery" Junction. Many of Nigeria\'s interstate roads, </p><p>particularly in the south, have become dilapidated and in </p><p>some areas nearly impassable, leading to ever-increasing </p><p>traffic congestion and vehicular accidents. Large trucks ply </p><p>the roads of Rivers State with loads picked up from the docks </p><p>of Port Harcourt as well as petroleum products. On the </p><p>highway leading out of Port Harcourt northeastward, tanker </p><p>trucks park along both sides of the road for miles near the </p><p>entrance to the government-run oil refinery, while others </p><p>move in and out of traffic slowly and erratically. In many </p><p>places roadways are reduced to rutted, water-filled single </p><p>lanes, sometimes haphazardly repaired by local boys with </p><p>shovels who ask passing motorists for money. It is common to </p><p>see large trucks tipped over, their cargo strewn along the </p><p>roadways. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment Continued: Forcing trucks to travel only at night </p><p>may help ease congestion in Rivers State, but it also forces </p><p>shippers, transport firms and other companies to adjust their </p><p>business practices. For example, Panalpina World Transport </p><p>now makes deliveries in Rivers State only at night. Further, </p><p>given the state of the roadways in the south, truck passage </p><p>may become more hazardous with less visibility and the </p><p>increased risk of highway robbery at night. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Comment Continued: It is unclear what effect forcing </p><p>trucks to travel at night will have on economic conditions </p><p>overall in Rivers State or to what extent the policy will </p><p>affect commerce between Port Harcourt and the rest of </p><p>Nigeria. We expect exemptions or daylight permits to be </p><p>offered for special fees. But if successful, we may see calls </p><p>for similar measures in traffic-choked cities such as Lagos </p><p>and Ibadan. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
