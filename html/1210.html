(C) SUMMARY: THE TENTH COMMUNIST PARTY PLENUM, </p><p>WHICH CONCLUDED JULY 4, FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON </p><p>FINALIZING KEY POLICY DOCUMENTS FOR THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS NEXT MARCH.  THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS </p><p>AGREED ON DRAFT TEXTS OF THE POLITICAL REPORT, FIVE- </p><p>YEAR ECONOMIC PLAN, 10-YEAR SOCIAL/ECONOMIC STRATEGY </p><p>PLAN, AND PARTY STATUTE, ALL OF WHICH NOW GO TO LOCAL </p><p>AND PROVINCIAL PARTY CONGRESSES FOR DISCUSSION </p><p>BEGINNING IN AUGUST.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PLENUM FINALIZES DRAFT REPORTS FOR PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE 165 CURRENT MEMBERS OF VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY (CPV) CENTRAL COMMITTEE MET FOR THEIR TENTH </p><p>PLENUM SESSION FROM JUNE 26-JULY 4 IN HANOI.  THE </p><p>PLENUM\'S PRIMARY AGENDA WAS TO FINALIZE THE KEY </p><p>DOCUMENTS FOR THE NINTH CPV CONGRESS, WHICH IS </p><p>TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED TO BE AT THE END OF MARCH 2001. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A BRIEFING BY CENTRAL COMMITTEE DEPUTY </p><p>HEAD OF IDEOLOGY DAO DUY QUAT, THE PLENUM MEMBERS </p><p>AGREED ON "MOST POINTS" OF THE DRAFT TEXTS OF THE FOUR </p><p>KEY REPORTS -- THE POLITICAL REPORT, THE ECONOMIC PLAN </p><p>FOR 2001-2005, 10-YEAR SOCIAL/ECONOMIC STRATEGY REPORT </p><p>FOR 2001-2010, AND THE PARTY STATUTE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENT: THIS PLENUM FINALIZED THE WORK OF </p><p>THE NINTH PLENUM IN APRIL, AT WHICH TIME THE CPV </p><p>LEADERSHIP HAD EXPECTED TO FINISH THESE DOCUMENTS. </p><p>THIS DELAY SUGGESTS THAT THE PARTY MAY HAVE TROUBLE </p><p>STAYING "ON SCHEDULE" TO HOLD THE CPV CONGRESS BY THE </p><p>END OF MARCH.  FIVE YEARS AGO, THE CPV EIGHTH CONGRESS </p><p>WAS DELAYED SEVERAL MONTHS TO FINISH THE CONSULTATION </p><p>PROCESS AND REACH AGREEMENT ON KEY DOCUMENTS.  ARGUING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01493  01 OF 04  101114Z </p><p>AGAINST A DELAY THIS TIME, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT </p><p>HANOI WILL BE HOSTING THE ASEAN MINISTERIAL, POST- </p><p>MINISTERIAL, AND ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM MEETINGS NEXT </p><p>SUMMER, PROBABLY IN JULY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THOUGH THE DRAFT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DOCUMENTS WERE NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC OR </p><p>CIRCULATED OUTSIDE THE PARTY, THERE WERE NO SURPRISES </p><p>REGARDING THE THEMES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PLENUM </p><p>COMMUNIQUE OR IN BRIEFINGS FOLLOWING THE PLENUM. </p><p>PICKING UP THEMES CITED IN RECENT SPEECHES BY CPV </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU AND IN THE COMMUNIQUE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE NINTH PLENUM IN APRIL, THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED IT WILL FURTHER OUTLINE HOW </p><p>VIETNAM PLANS TO DEVELOP ITS "MULTI-SECTOR, MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTED SOCIALIST ECONOMY."  OVERALL THE PLENUM </p><p>CONTINUED THE PARTY\'S EMPHASIS ON STABILITY AND </p><p>INCREMENTAL ECONOMIC POLICY CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) IN A PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER THE PLENUM, QUAT </p><p>SAID THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HELD EXTENSIVE DEBATE OVER </p><p>FOUR MAIN SUBJECTS THAT THE POLITBURO AND PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS DRAFTING COMMITTEE WERE LOOKING AT REGARDING </p><p>THE PARTY CONGRESS DOCUMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- AN EVALUATION OF THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SITUATIONS, WITH ATTENTION TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND </p><p>CHALLENGES FACING VIETNAM IN THE 21ST CENTURY; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FORMS OF OWNERSHIP ALLOWED IN VIETNAM AND THE </p><p>VARIOUS ECONOMIC SECTORS IN THIS PERIOD OF "TRANSITION </p><p>TO SOCIALISM"; </p><p> </p><p>-- BUILDING AN INDEPENDENT AND SELF-RELIANT ECONOMY; </p><p> </p><p>-- DIRECTIONS FOR THE CPV\'S "PARTY BUILDING" IN THE </p><p>COMING YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>(COMMENT: THE RUBRIC OF "TRANSITION TO SOCIALISM" IS </p><p>HOW THE CPV DESCRIBES WHERE VIETNAM IS ON THE ROAD TO </p><p>ITS GLORIOUS "SOCIALIST" FUTURE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT </p><p>MARKETS ARE PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01493  02 OF 04  101114Z </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) SPEAKING AT THE CLOSE OF THE PLENUM, PHIEU </p><p>AFFIRMED THE CPV WOULD CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO A MULTI- </p><p>SECTOR ECONOMY IN WHICH THE STATE PLAYS A LEADERSHIP </p><p>ROLE.  HE REVIEWED, IN DIALECTICAL FASHION, BOTH THE </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF </p><p>VIETNAM IN RECENT YEARS AND SUGGESTED THE KEY TASKS </p><p>FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND </p><p>MODERNIZATION IN THE YEARS AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AN OFFICER AT THE CHINESE MISSION IN HANOI </p><p>INFORMED POLCOUNS THAT THIS YEAR\'S POLITICAL REPORT IS </p><p>MUCH MORE STREAMLINED THAN IN PAST YEARS: 63 PAGES, </p><p>WITH 10 MAIN THEMES.  ACCORDING TO THE PRC MISSION, </p><p>THIS CONTRASTS WITH THE 1996 POLITICAL REPORT AT THE </p><p>EIGHTH CONGRESS, WHICH WAS UNWIELDY AT MORE THAN 100 </p><p>PAGES AND HAD LITTLE THEMATIC UNITY.  THE THEMES CITED </p><p>BY QUAT (PARA 6 ABOVE) COMPRISE AT LEAST FOUR OF THESE </p><p>10 THEMES, ACCORDING TO THE PRC EMBOFF, AND WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT, BROKEN OUT INTO SUB-THEMES, THEY MAY COMPRISE </p><p>THE BULK OF THE POLITICAL REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>PLENUM FOCUSES ON GLOBALIZATION, THOUGH NOT BTA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE MEDIA AND </p><p>DIPLOMATS, QUAT SAID MUCH OF THE PLENUM DISCUSSION </p><p>FOCUSED ON GLOBALIZATION, INCLUDING ITS POSITIVE AND </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT.  THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>AND GAVE GENERAL ASSENT TO A GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01493  02 OF 04  101114Z </p><p>DEVELOP A "KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY" TO MAKE GREATER </p><p>USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  (WE WILL REPORT </p><p>FURTHER ON THESE ISSUES IN FORTHCOMING SEPTEL.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION, QUAT </p><p>SAID THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) WAS NOT </p><p>DISCUSSED SPECIFICALLY, THOUGH THERE WAS MUCH GENERAL </p><p>DISCUSSION ON GLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. </p><p>CHOOSING HIS WORDS WITH OBVIOUS CARE, QUAT DESCRIBED </p><p>THE THEN-UPCOMING TRIP OF TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN TO </p><p>WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BARSHEFSKY AND NOTED VIETNAM\'S INTEREST IN CONCLUDING </p><p>THE BTA SOON.  HE SAID "IT IS HOPED BOTH SIDES WILL </p><p>REFLECT ON THE ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES" AT </p><p>STAKE CONCERNING THE BTA, AND THAT IF A TEXT CAN BE </p><p>AGREED UPON THAT "CONFORMS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>EQUALITY AND MUTUAL BENEFIT," THEN THE BTA CAN BE </p><p>SIGNED SOON.  (COMMENT: THOUGH A CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, QUAT IS NOT A KEY PLAYER ON THE BTA, </p><p>AND WE DO NOT READ INTO HIS RESPONSE ANY GREAT </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE, AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECENT </p><p>GVN STATEMENTS ON THE BTA.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>DOCUMENTS PASSED TO LOCAL CONGRESSES FOR DISCUSSION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ALL OF THE KEY PARTY CONGRESS DOCUMENTS WILL </p><p>NOW BE TRANSMITTED TO THE LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL PARTY </p><p>CONGRESSES FOR DISCUSSION BY LOCAL CPV MEMBERS AT </p><p>"GRASSROOTS LEVELS."  ACCORDING TO THE CPV\'S POLICY OF </p><p>"DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM," THE CPV MEMBERS WILL PROVIDE </p><p>FEEDBACK AND INPUT TO THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE THAT IS </p><p>FINALIZING THESE DOCUMENTS FOR PRESENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) QUAT SAID CPV CONGRESSES AT ALL SUBORDINATE </p><p>LEVELS -- FIRST LOCAL LEVELS AND LATER PROVINCIAL AND </p><p>MUNICIPAL LEVELS (THE LATTER FOR LARGE CITIES SUCH AS </p><p>HANOI, HO CHI MINH CITY AND DANANG) -- WOULD BEGIN </p><p>MEETING IN AUGUST.  QUAT SAID THE PARTY\'S NEXT PLENUM </p><p>WOULD BE HELD AFTER ALL THE LOCAL CONGRESSES ARE </p><p>CONDUCTED, LIKELY IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER.  ANOTHER CPV </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE STATED THERE WOULD BE YET ANOTHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01493  03 OF 04  101114Z </p><p>PLENUM (WHICH WOULD BE THE TWELFTH) PRIOR TO THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS (PRESUMABLY AT THE BEGINNING OF 2001).  QUAT </p><p>SAID THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DOCUMENTS WOULD BE </p><p>PUBLISHED OPENLY IN EARLY 2001 SO THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>PUBLIC AT LARGE COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO COMMENT ON THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO THE CONGRESS.  (SEPTEL WILL REPORT </p><p>FURTHER ON THE ROAD TO THE PARTY CONGRESS AND THE </p><p>MEETINGS LEADING UP TO IT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>PARTY-BUILDING, SELF-CRITICISM, AND STANDING BOARD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) AT THE PLENUM, GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU ALSO </p><p>CALLED FOR CONTINUING THE PARTY-BUILDING AND </p><p>RECTIFICATION CAMPAIGN, WHICH HE ADMITTED HAD MET WITH </p><p>LIMITED SUCCESS.  (NOTE: FOR THE PAST YEAR THE CPV HAS </p><p>BEEN ENGAGED IN A CRITICISM/SELF-CRITICISM CAMPAIGN, </p><p>WHICH HAS LED TO THE CENSURING OF SEVERAL SENIOR PARTY </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING FORMER DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER LOC, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT GIA, AND FORMER CUSTOMS CHIEF DINH.)  PHIEU </p><p>URGED THAT THE PARTY CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO BUILD A </p><p>STRONGER ORGANIZATION AND MAINTAIN PRINCIPLES AND </p><p>INTEGRITY.  HE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>MEMBERS CONTINUE THIS CAMPAIGN AFTER THE CONGRESS. </p><p>UNLIKE THE NINTH PLENUM THAT ENDED APRIL 19, PARTY </p><p>PERSONNEL ISSUES WERE NOT DISCUSSED SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO QUAT. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION, QUAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01493  03 OF 04  101114Z </p><p>SAID THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE VOTED TO RETAIN THE PRESENT </p><p>STRUCTURE OF THE POLITBURO STANDING BOARD, COMPRISED </p><p>OF THE CPV\'S FIVE MOST SENIOR MEMBERS.  AT THE LAST </p><p>PLENUM, THE CPV HAD CONSIDERED RETURNING TO A </p><p>POLITBURO SECRETARIAT, COMPOSED OF STAFF PRESUMABLY TO </p><p>HELP THE SENIOR POLITBURO MEMBERS DEAL WITH THE PRESS </p><p>OF BUSINESS ON THEIR SCHEDULES.  HOWEVER, QUAT SAID </p><p>THE PLENUM WOULD NOW RECOMMEND TO THE PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>TO MAINTAIN THE PRESENT STRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER QUESTION, QUAT SAID </p><p>THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF WHETHER TO COMBINE THE </p><p>ROLES OF PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE PRESIDENT. </p><p>(COMMENT: WE UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW </p><p>PHIEU TO ATTAIN THE DUAL STATUS SIMILAR TO THAT HELD </p><p>BY PRC PRESIDENT JIANG, CONTINUES TO BE DISCUSSED </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND MAY YET BE ADOPTED AT </p><p>THE PARTY CONGRESS, THOUGH THE OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) COMMENT: THIS PLENUM CONTAINED LITTLE OF </p><p>SURPRISE.  THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FINALIZED DRAFTS OF </p><p>THE KEY PARTY REPORTS, AND WE SEE LITTLE VISION AMIDST </p><p>THE THEMES HIGHLIGHTED.  THE BROAD DEBATE ON </p><p>GLOBALIZATION AND A "KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY" IS </p><p>INTRIGUING TO US; OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THINK TANK SOURCES SUGGEST THERE IS A GROWING </p><p>REALIZATION AT MID-LEVELS OF THE CPV AND GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF VIETNAM\'S MOVING FORWARD WITH </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>THE BENEFITS OF GREATER TRADE AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  HOWEVER, AS ALWAYS IN THIS </p><p>HIGHLY PATERNALISTIC POLITICAL CULTURE, WHAT DECIDES </p><p>THE DAY IS WHAT THE SENIOR-MOST LEADERS OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO THINK ON THESE QUESTIONS.  EXPERIENCE SHOWS </p><p>THEY PREFER A CAUTIOUS, INCREMENTAL APPROACH.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
