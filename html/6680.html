Hull, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) March 23 to discuss current threat </p><p>information, enhanced security measures and Embassy security </p><p>posture.  EAC decided to move from StandFast to MoveSafe </p><p>effective 3/23 at the close of business.  Key offices and </p><p>personnel represented at the meeting included: AMB, DCM, </p><p>POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, DATT, ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, </p><p>FPD and RMO.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Current Threat Information </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new threat information.  ORCA </p><p>and RSO reported that the Political Security Organization </p><p>(PSO) and Ministry of Interior had no indications of any </p><p>upcoming planned demonstrations.  ORCA noted that the PSO </p><p>continues to make arrests in relation to the 3/21 </p><p>demonstration that turned violent, including a ROYG move to </p><p>ask the Shura Council and Council of Deputies (the upper and </p><p>lower houses of parliament) for a waiver of immunity for two </p><p>of its members, both Nasserite party members involved in </p><p>organizing and inciting the unauthorized demonstration.  DATT </p><p>briefed on developments with the Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  EAC discussed what Embassy personnel are hearing </p><p>about popular opinion.  PD reported anecdotal information </p><p>from contacts that Yemeni "street" opinion is rising in </p><p>anger. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Increased Security Measures </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  RSO briefed EAC on increased security measures. </p><p>Embassy stood down the 24/7 watchstanders.  The location </p><p>where cars are swept outside the compound was changed to be </p><p>farther away from the street.  Embassy employees other than </p><p>cleared Americans will no longer be allowed to park vehicles </p><p>inside the compound.  ROYG security enhancements and </p><p>responses include: </p><p> </p><p>-- providing additional personnel and equipment to guard the </p><p>Embassy, residences and other Amcit locations such as the </p><p>Sheraton Hotel. </p><p> </p><p>-- ensuring that Iraqi agents are under 24-hour surveillance. </p><p> </p><p>-- working with the Embassy to compile a list of expat </p><p>Americans and their contact information to provide extra </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>--attempting to manage public opinion through statements and </p><p>the media to avoid violent reaction. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Embassy Change to MoveSafe 3/23 COB </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  EAC decided to alter Embassy\'s security posture from </p><p>StandFast to MoveSafe effective COB 3/23.  MoveSafe entails </p><p>curtailed operations, limited movement from residence to </p><p>Embassy and to essential meetings and travel exclusively in </p><p>armored vehicles.  Despite the end of StandFast, the Embassy </p><p>will not/not be open to provide visa/consular services to the </p><p>public.  Armored vehicle shuttle services began after EAC to </p><p>ensure a well-staggered departure from the Embassy.  FSNs </p><p>will return to work on 3/24 as normal. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>No Request for Authorized Departure </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  EAC discussed whether a request should be made to </p><p>move to authorized departure status and deferred making a </p><p>recommendation pending developments.  The issue remains open </p><p>and under active review, and will be discussed further in </p><p>connection with tripwires (particularly the possibility of </p><p>further violent demonstrations in coming days). </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
