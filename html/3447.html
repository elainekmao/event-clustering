<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PBTS, MOPS, CM, FR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO AND A/S </p><p>KANSTEINER DISCUSS BAKASSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2268 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON </p><p>1.6X5 AND 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. During their July 25 meeting at Aso </p><p>Rock Villa, President Obasanjo and Assistant Secretary </p><p>Kansteiner discussed major regional conflicts and the </p><p>potential crisis on Nigeria\'s southeastern border -- </p><p>the Bakassi. This cable reports the discussion on </p><p>Bakassi. Other topics are reported septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) On Bakassi, President Obasanjo asked our help </p><p>urging Cameroon toward a negotiated "political </p><p>solution" rather than waiting for a winner-take-all </p><p>ICJ judgment that might heighten tensions between the </p><p>two countries. Joining President Obasanjo in the </p><p>meeting were NSA Aliyu Mohammed, Minister of </p><p>Cooperation and African Integration Bimbola Ogunkelu, </p><p>the President\'s Chief of Staff and MFA Americas </p><p>Officer Director Basil Ukpong. Ambassador Jeter, Lagos </p><p>Consul General Hinson-Jones, A/S Senior Special </p><p>Advisor Jim Dunlap and PolCouns (notetaker) </p><p>accompanied A/S Kansteiner. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Bakassi Is A Problem! </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During most of this 90-minute meeting, Obasanjo </p><p>was in relaxed good spirits.  But as discussions swung </p><p>toward Bakassi, the President\'s look turned to one of </p><p>deep concern and his speaking cadence became more </p><p>deliberate, as if to underscore the gravity of the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When he was military Head of State, Obasanjo </p><p>recalled, the border friction with Cameroon was </p><p>contained and had not assumed the ominous significance </p><p>it has today. Twenty some years ago, he was able to </p><p>manage difficulties and maintain good rapport with </p><p>Cameroon\'s leader Ahidjo. Successor leaders in both </p><p>countries, unfortunately, allowed the dispute to </p><p>percolate. (Comment: Obasanjo offered his personal </p><p>historical perspective to set the stage for his </p><p>request to us. In attesting to his own "innocence," he </p><p>also was casting blame at the military rulers who </p><p>followed him.  Because someone got him into this mess, </p><p>he feels he has the moral standing to ask someone else </p><p>-- the United States and others -- to help him out of </p><p>it.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Immediately after his 1999 election, Obasanjo </p><p>made a goodwill visit to Yaounde. At that time Biya </p><p>wanted to discuss Bakassi; however, believing the </p><p>discussion inappropriate since he was not yet </p><p>inaugurated, Obasanjo demurred, saying he lacked the </p><p>authority to consult at that time. Once sworn in, he </p><p>would eagerly talk Bakassi, Obasanjo told the </p><p>Cameroonian. Obasanjo told Biya that he had come so </p><p>soon after the election as a goodwill gesture but that </p><p>he could not discuss such a weighty matter without </p><p>formally being in office. That his temporary reticence </p><p>came when the moody Biya was ready to talk might have </p><p>permanently "turned Biya off" from talking to him, </p><p>Obasanjo speculated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Since taking office, Obasanjo tried several </p><p>times to communicate but Biya has rebuffed him and his </p><p>emissaries at every turn. Believing Cameroon might </p><p>listen to the French, Obasanjo raised Bakassi with </p><p>President Chirac, asking the Gallic leader to act as </p><p>an intermediary. He recalled translating for Chirac a </p><p>Yoruba adage " that you don\'t go to court against </p><p>someone and come back as friends."  Obasanjo advised </p><p>Chirac to take the "African way" by not labeling </p><p>either party as completely right or absolutely wrong; </p><p>instead, he counseled the French President to </p><p>apportion both blame and credit to each side. This way </p><p>neither side would lose face or gloat completely. </p><p>Chirac initially accepted the assignment with </p><p>enthusiasm; however, after talking to Biya, Chirac\'s </p><p>enthusiasm waned. Biya, confident of his chances </p><p>before the ICJ, had turned a stubborn and deaf ear to </p><p>the French President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Obasanjo and Chirac had their most recent </p><p>discussion on Bakassi on the margin of the Kananaskis </p><p>G-8 Summit.  During this meeting, Obasanjo stressed a </p><p>court decision completely negating all Nigerian claims </p><p>would be very "hard to swallow politically."  However, </p><p>he explained, a "political solution" could be </p><p>fashioned to make the negative impact more gradual and </p><p>thus more palatable.  Even if Bakassi inhabitants had </p><p>to change their nationality, a deliberate approach </p><p>that protected their rights and did not generate </p><p>upheaval or panic should be explored, Obasanjo told </p><p>Chirac.  At the end of their talks, Obasanjo asked </p><p>Chirac to intercede once more. Chirac responded that </p><p>he would raise the matter with Kofi Annan and ask </p><p>Annan to talk to Obasanjo. (Comment: Apparently, </p><p>Obasanjo was unable to elicit from Chirac a firm </p><p>commitment to talk to Biya; if Chirac had committed, </p><p>Obasanjo probably would have told us. From Obasanjo\'s </p><p>own rendition of his last encounter with the French </p><p>leader, Chirac seemed less than keen on revisiting </p><p>this matter with Biya. Attempting to pass the baton, </p><p>Chirac appears to be pushing Kofi Annan into the spot </p><p>Obasanjo wants Chirac to occupy. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) In their conversation, Obasanjo told Annan that </p><p>Nigeria had established a senior level implementation </p><p>commission to plan how to handle the ICJ decision, </p><p>whether negative or positive.  He stressed to Annan, </p><p>however, that Nigeria and Cameroon should be working </p><p>toward a peaceful political solution before the </p><p>verdict. Annan endorsed the idea, according to </p><p>Obasanjo. Obasanjo then asked Annan to discuss this </p><p>approach with Chirac.  (Comment: Obasanjo has </p><p>initiated a diplomatic round-robin that thus far has </p><p>yielded only half of what he seeks. He talked to </p><p>Chirac who shuffled him to Annan as the one to see. He </p><p>conferred with Annan whom he asked to talk to Chirac. </p><p>Seems the trio agree on a general approach, but </p><p>Obasanjo does not appear to have successfully </p><p>convinced either Chirac (again) or Annan (first time) </p><p>to approach Biya directly.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Irrespective of the outcome of the ICJ verdict, </p><p>Obasanjo told Kansteiner, both nations would have to </p><p>cooperate to implement cardinal aspects of the verdict </p><p>dealing with boundary demarcation and movement of </p><p>people. Awkward as it might be, Nigeria was open to </p><p>talk because it could not wish Cameroon away.  Try as </p><p>he could, Biya "might be able to wish me away but he </p><p>could not wish Nigeria away," Obasanjo quipped. </p><p>Obasanjo added that while he wanted to work for a </p><p>peaceful solution, the GON was receiving reports of </p><p>increased harassment of Nigerian inhabitants in the </p><p>Bakassi by Cameroonian authorities. These reports only </p><p>increased the temperature and could be a source of </p><p>provocation, the President implied. (Comment: Alluding </p><p>to his domestic political woes, Obasanjo half-joked </p><p>that before long Biya\'s wish to be rid of him might </p><p>come true.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) A/S Kansteiner responded the USG wanted </p><p>Bakassi resolved peacefully; therefore, we would help </p><p>where possible but our influence with Biya was less </p><p>than that of France. Kansteiner mentioned new French </p><p>Foreign Minister de Villepin, although only a few </p><p>months on the job, had taken a keen interest in things </p><p>African. Nigeria would likely find France\'s new top </p><p>diplomat a helpful interlocutor. Kansteiner offered </p><p>that we would be willing to raise Bakassi with de </p><p>Villepin.  Perking up somewhat, Obasanjo interjected </p><p>that working through the French Foreign Minister might </p><p>be a good avenue to encourage France to re-engage </p><p>Biya. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Immediately before the session with the </p><p>President, A/S Kansteiner met NSA Aliyu Mohammed where </p><p>Bakassi was also discussed.  Mohammed claimed Nigeria </p><p>was prepared to forcibly settle Bakassi 20 years ago </p><p>but President Shagari refused to go to war.  Since </p><p>then, there had been numerous flare-ups regarding the </p><p>peninsula.  With the advent of the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration, Mohammed claimed the GON had done its </p><p>utmost to talk to Biya.  However, the Cameroonian, </p><p>smug in the belief that he has the stronger legal </p><p>case, rebuffed every Nigerian overture.  Mohammed </p><p>recalled going to London with a letter from President </p><p>Obasanjo to hand to Biya, only to discover that Biya </p><p>had scotched the rendezvous at the last minute, even </p><p>though the two were staying at the same hotel.  After </p><p>summarizing Obasanjo\'s efforts with Chirac and Annan, </p><p>Mohammed stressed the GON wanted to be engaged in </p><p>negotiations with Cameroon quickly in order to resolve </p><p>the matter by November, the month the Nigerians </p><p>project the ICJ will render its decision. </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Clearly, President Obasanjo and his foreign </p><p>policy team are deeply concerned about Bakassi. </p><p>Obasanjo did not explicitly state Nigeria would go to </p><p>war if it lost the ICJ case and if Biya remains </p><p>steadfastly intransigent. However, with the President </p><p>twice stressing his hope for a "peaceful political </p><p>solution," the implication is inescapable that a </p><p>Nigerian military response is possible should Biya </p><p>continue to refuse to engage. To a degree, some of </p><p>these dire insinuations may be to stoke the USG, the </p><p>French and others to intercede. Nevertheless, this is </p><p>not simply a negotiating tactic. Nigerian concern is </p><p>real that domestic pressures might compel a military </p><p>response if Cameroon overplays its hand by refusing </p><p>even the possibility of negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) To lessen the possibility of military action, </p><p>Biya and Obasanjo should talk. Herein, lies the rub. </p><p>While Obasanjo might have gotten sympathetic hearings </p><p>from Annan and Chirac, neither apparently committed to </p><p>directly asking Biya to soften. Obasanjo is now asking </p><p>the USG to approach Biya as well as to persuade the </p><p>French to do so. Biya will be a very difficult sell. </p><p>While we defer to the opinion of our colleagues in </p><p>Yaounde regarding Biya\'s modes and moods, convincing </p><p>him to negotiate will likely take a lot more than a </p><p>subtle nudge. What advantage does he derive by </p><p>removing from the game the ICJ trump card he currently </p><p>holds in order for the Nigerians to have their desire </p><p>for a reshuffled deck?  For negotiations to have a </p><p>chance, it appears the parties would have to agree </p><p>that the expected outcome of the ICJ opinion should be </p><p>the "informal basis," the starting point for </p><p>apportioning the relative rights, claims and duties of </p><p>the two sides in a compromise arrangement on the </p><p>Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) Ambassador Jeter has briefed French Ambassador </p><p>Simon on the Obasanjo-Kansteiner discussion of </p><p>Bakassi. Simon was grateful and agreed with the </p><p>proposed approach of us engaging Foreign Minister de </p><p>Villepin. Simon is a close friend of de Villepin and </p><p>thinks the Foreign Minister will try to be helpful. </p><p>Simon also believes Chirac has more influence with </p><p>Biya than anyone else; nonetheless, Simon is uncertain </p><p>that Biya will listen to anyone, including his </p><p>respected mentor. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
