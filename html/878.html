(U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBIN L. RAPHEL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE. </p><p>REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) DURING THE COURSE OF A 4/29 TELCON, SAUDI POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR RAHAB MASSOUD AFFIRMED TO SA A/S RAPHEL THAT THE </p><p>SAG\'S FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET THE TALIBAN TO HAND OVER TO </p><p>THEM OSAMA BIN LADEN. THEIR SECOND PRIORITY IS TO KEEP BIN </p><p>LADEN FROM DIRECTING OPERATIONS OR HAVING ACCESS TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND TO OTHER RADICAL ISLAMISTS. THE </p><p>SAUDIS WERE GREATLY UPSET BY THE SPATE OF MEDIA INTERVIEWS </p><p>AND ARTICLES THAT APPEARED WHEN BIN LADEN WAS IN THE </p><p>JALALABAD AREA.  THEY DISCUSSED BIN LADEN\'S MEDIA ACCESS </p><p>WITH THE TALIBAN. THE SAG IS HOPEFUL THAT THE TALIBAN </p><p>DECISION TO MOVE BIN LADEN CLOSE TO TALIBAN HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>KANDAHAR WILL EFFECTIVELY KEEP BIN LADEN ISOLATED, AWAY </p><p>FROM THE MEDIA AND UNDER TALIBAN CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) RAHAB ALSO SAID THEY ARE PRESSING THE TALIBAN ON </p><p>VARIOUS FRONTS -- POLITICALLY, RELIGIOUSLY AND LEGALLY -- </p><p>ON THEIR DEALINGS WITH BIN LADEN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SAUDIS </p><p>HAVE SENT A DELEGATION OF RELIGIOUS EXPERTS TO DISCUSS </p><p>ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE WITH THE TALIBAN AND, PRESUMABLY, TO </p><p>OFFER THEM ISLAM-BASED JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TURNING BIN LADEN </p><p>OVER TO THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
