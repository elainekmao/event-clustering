<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREF, PHUM, PTER, CE, KWMM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Displaced person returns to Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>north/east continue to swell </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 543, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The number of displaced persons </p><p>returning to Sri Lanka\'s north/east continues to swell </p><p>and now stands at 270,000.  The returnees are Tamil; few </p><p>are Muslim.  In other trends, many Tamils also appear to </p><p>be leaving the war-ravaged north/east in search of </p><p>economic opportunities in the south.  The high number of </p><p>returnees seems to represent a vote of confidence in the </p><p>peace process.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) RETURNS SWELL:  In its latest figures, UNHCR </p><p>has told us that the total number of Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDPs) who have returned to their </p><p>points of origin in the north/east has swelled to over </p><p>270,000 as of the end of January.  UNHCR reports that </p><p>35,000 additional returnees went back to their home </p><p>areas in the three-month time span between late 2002 and </p><p>January 2003.   UNHCR estimates that the rate of return </p><p>will continue at a clip of about 10,000 a month for the </p><p>foreseeable future.  Given the time-lag in its figures, </p><p>this means that as of April 2003 close to 300,000 IDPs </p><p>may have returned to their home areas since the start of </p><p>the peace process in December 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUSLIMS STAY PUT:  The vast majority of the </p><p>returnees continue to travel to the Jaffna Peninsula in </p><p>northern Sri Lanka and to points in the east.  The </p><p>returnees are invariably Tamil.  The number of Muslim </p><p>IDPs returning to their home areas is very, very low. </p><p>(Note:  Explaining this phenomenon, M.I.M. Mohideen, </p><p>chairman of the Muslim Rights Organization (MRO), </p><p>recently released a statement asserting that Muslims </p><p>simply did not trust the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam, "LTTE."   According to Mohideen, despite LTTE </p><p>entreaties, Muslims are not comfortable with the group </p><p>and do not plan to return to their homes in the north </p><p>soon.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MANY TAMILS GO SOUTH, TOO:  In addition to the </p><p>high rate of returns by IDPs, there are also indications </p><p>that many Tamils are leaving the north/east in search of </p><p>education and employment in the south.  Non-government </p><p>organizations (NGOs) focused on migration have noted </p><p>that the economic situation in the south remains much, </p><p>much better than that in the war-torn north/east.  In </p><p>light of the reopening of many roads throughout the </p><p>country, Tamils can now easily move back-and-forth, </p><p>allowing many to try their luck in the south.  (Note: </p><p>In the past, before the start of the peace process, it </p><p>was very difficult for Tamils to move around the country </p><p>due to the war and government security regulations.) </p><p>Many of the Tamils who go south wind up in Colombo, </p><p>where the Tamil community constitutes perhaps a third of </p><p>the population. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  The continued high rate of returns </p><p>seems to be a clear indication that Tamil IDPs have a </p><p>high degree of confidence in the current peace process. </p><p>That said, over 500,000 IDPs still remain in camps or </p><p>with families in the south, and it is not clear when the </p><p>bulk of these might go home (if ever).  (Note:  Mission </p><p>has not heard any reports that indicate that the </p><p>approximately 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India </p><p>plan to return home at any time soon.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
