<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UPDATE ON BENUE COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ABUJA 1193 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: The Secretary of the Judicial Commission </p><p>investigating the Zaki-Biam killings January 16 told </p><p>PolCouns that while the Commission had completed the fact- </p><p>finding part of its mission, its final report would not be </p><p>ready until March.  Sufi confirmed that the Commission\'s </p><p>report would include indictments of those found responsible </p><p>for the October 2001 violence in Benue State.  He thought </p><p>the retirements and transfers mentioned in President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s letter to Senator Feingold were routine </p><p>administrative actions.  Sufi\'s version, however, was </p><p>contradicted by Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa, who told the Ambassador on January 29 that the </p><p>retirements/transfers were in response to the killings in </p><p>Benue.  Batagarawa said he would provide additional </p><p>information next week, but would not divulge the names of </p><p>those involved until the Judicial Commission\'s report is </p><p>released.  Batagarawa maintained that the </p><p>retirement/transfers resulted from the Army\'s own internal </p><p>review.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a January 16 conversation with POLCOUNS, </p><p>Secretary of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on Inter- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>communal Conflicts in Plateau, Benue, Taraba and Nassarawa </p><p>States Dr. Sani Sufi related the current status of the </p><p>Commission\'s report.  According to Sufi, the Commission has </p><p>interviewed over 1,000 people who were witness to or </p><p>involved in inter-communal violence.  Sufi offered to allow </p><p>Polcouns to view some of the videotaped testimony - </p><p>including that of former Army Chief of Staff General Victor </p><p>Malu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) With the fact-finding part of its mission now </p><p>behind it, Sufi said, the Commission would now focus on </p><p>analyzing all of the evidence and reaching a consensus on </p><p>the report it will submit to the GON.  Sufi thought the </p><p>report would be completed in March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Sufi said he was very pleased with the work the </p><p>Commission had done so far.  He believed that, at a </p><p>minimum, the 1,000-plus interviews the Commission had </p><p>conducted in the course of its investigation had given </p><p>people a chance to talk about their experiences and to vent </p><p>some of their anger and frustration.  He hoped such open </p><p>dialogue would help relieve tension and lead to more frank </p><p>discussions of the problems and of the solutions to inter- </p><p>communal violence in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) After discussing the status of the Commission, </p><p>PolCouns related the contents of President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>letter to Senator Feingold.  The letter stated "all </p><p>officers involved in the Zaki-Biam incident have been </p><p>reassigned and are no longer in command, pending the Report </p><p>of the Judicial (Commission)."  (COMMENT: While the letter </p><p>does not explicitly say the transfers were a result of the </p><p>officers involvement in the violence in Benue State, that </p><p>is the implication.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Sufi said he had not heard of the letter until he </p><p>was asked about it by Minister of State for Defense (Army) </p><p>Lawal Batagarawa\'s office after Ambassador had raised the </p><p>issue during a January 9 meeting with the Minister.  During </p><p>that meeting, Batagarawa said he had no knowledge of the </p><p>letter, nor could he verify that the officers involved were </p><p>reassigned or relieved of command.  However, Batagarawa </p><p>noted, "If Mr. President says this happened, then it is the </p><p>truth."  Sufi did not try as hard to support the </p><p>President\'s story.  He postulated that since the Commission </p><p>had not yet completed its report, the GON could not know </p><p>which officers to hold responsible.  Sufi believed any </p><p>transfers or retirements were not punitive in nature, but </p><p>rather routine administrative actions.  (COMMENT: In a </p><p>January 25 meeting with the Ambassador, President Obasanjo </p><p>said that he was not certain who had drafted his letter to </p><p>Senator Feingold, but he thought it might have been </p><p>Ministers of State for Defense (Army) Batagarawa. </p><p>Presidential Special Assistant for International Affairs </p><p>Ad\'Obe Obe, who also was not sure who authored the letter, </p><p>vaguely remembered that the letter may have been "handed" </p><p>to him by Nigeria\'s Ambassador to Washington, Professor </p><p>Jibril Aminu.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Sufi\'s version of events was later contradicted by </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa, who </p><p>told the Ambassador on January 29 that the </p><p>retirements/transfers were in response to the killings in </p><p>Benue.  Batagarawa said he would provide additional </p><p>information next week, but would not divulge the names of </p><p>those involved until the Judicial Commission\'s report is </p><p>released.  Batagarawa maintained that the </p><p>retirements/transfers resulted from the Army\'s own internal </p><p>review.  Noting Batagarawa\'s newly found knowledge of the </p><p>retirements/transfers, Ambassador said he hoped the </p><p>Feingold letter was not a ruse on the part of the GON to </p><p>placate the Senator. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DAO Abuja sources report no Army personnel have </p><p>been punished for their involvement in the killings in </p><p>Benue.  Outside of routine personnel rotation, no officers </p><p>have been moved.  DAO sources also corroborate Sufi\'s </p><p>assertion that decisions regarding reprimands for officers </p><p>involved in Benue will not be made until the Commission\'s </p><p>full report is presented to the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT: While the slow, but steady progress of the </p><p>Commission is heartening, post cannot help but be concerned </p><p>over the Obasanjo-Feingold letter.  While the letter does </p><p>not explicitly claim that the transfers were effected to </p><p>punish offenders, mention of them in this letter strongly </p><p>suggests a GON desire for us to interpret that assertion </p><p>this way.  The intent of the letter is clear, therefore, </p><p>even if the wisdom in sending it was more dubious.  It is </p><p>possible that in an attempt to placate Senator Feingold, </p><p>the GON overreached in saying what it thought the Senator </p><p>wanted to hear.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
