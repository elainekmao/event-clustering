(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During the course of a 5/31 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador (other topics covered septel), MFA </p><p>Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid noted UAE disappointment </p><p>with the statement produced at last week\'s OIC </p><p>meeting in Tehran.  Prior to receiving the </p><p>Ambassador, Hamdan had just met with Moroccan </p><p>Foreign Minister Ben Eissa and both agreed that the </p><p>OIC declaration was "one hundred percent" Iranian </p><p>and written prior to the event.  Reportedly, the </p><p>Iranians refused to make any changes to the </p><p>document.  Ben Eissa and Hamdan were both worried </p><p>by the course of events inside Iran and Ben Eissa </p><p>noted that Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi was </p><p>noticeably stressed and unusually nervous during </p><p>the summit.  (Note:  Hamdan\'s privately expressed </p><p>disappointment is in contrast to ref official </p><p>statement released by the UAEG at the OIC </p><p>ministerial describing the outcome of the </p><p>conference as "good."  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan went on to reiterate UAE concerns </p><p>about the internal struggle in Iran between the </p><p>hardliners and the moderates.  In his view, Khatami </p><p>has been completely marginalized and Rafsanjani and </p><p>Khamenei are increasingly taking over the reins of </p><p>power. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  The Emiratis had placed great hope </p><p>in Khatami as an interlocutor and partner, both in </p><p>terms of improving UAE-Iranian ties and enhancing </p><p>regional security.  Khatami and confidant VP </p><p>Muhammad Abtahi had worked closely with Hamdan and </p><p>the UAE leadership to forge a possible settlement </p><p>for the three decade-long dispute between the two </p><p>countries over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the </p><p>Greater and Lesser Tunbs.  With Khatami on the </p><p>outs, the Emiratis fear that any opportunity to </p><p>settle this longstanding bilateral irritant will be </p><p>lost.  More importantly, they with extreme concern </p><p>the destabilizing effect on the region of the </p><p>hardliners\' approach. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
