The notable absence of Baburam Bhattarai, number two </p><p>leader and head of the Maoist negotiating team, has raised </p><p>speculation that the Maoist ideologue is once again out of </p><p>the country.  Senior Maoist leaders continue to condemn </p><p>alleged US "interference" in Nepal.  Uncertainty persists </p><p>over the next round of peace talks, with no date set for the </p><p>third round.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is </p><p>awaiting a response from the Government of Nepal (GON) on </p><p>the draft it submitted to ensure adherence to the ceasefire. </p><p>Maoists held several rallies, including a massive one in </p><p>downtown Kathmandu.  The insurgents reportedly forced </p><p>thousands of schoolchildren to attend.  Maoists abducted </p><p>four civilians, including a Red Cross official, beat to </p><p>death a civilian, and seriously injured another.  In a </p><p>separate incident, the insurgents brutally assaulted a </p><p>schoolteacher who refused to provide "donations," and took </p><p>control of a micro-hydro project after the managing operator </p><p>refused the insurgents\' demands for money.  Maoists </p><p>reportedly have threatened to cut off the hands and legs of </p><p>those who defy orders not to attend health camps conducted </p><p>by the RNA.  The humanitarian outreach efforts by the RNA </p><p>reportedly have been highly successful.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>BHATTARAI OUT OF SIGHT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Baburam Bhattarai, number two leader and head of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team, has not been seen publicly for </p><p>several weeks.  The Maoist ideologue, who has dominated the </p><p>press since coming out of hiding, has been </p><p>uncharacteristically silent.  Peace talk facilitators </p><p>reportedly said that they had not been in contact with the </p><p>Maoist ideologue because he was out of Kathmandu.  There is </p><p>speculation that Bhattarai is visiting neighboring India. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CONTINUE ANTI-US RHETORIC </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Maoist leaders continued to condemn the United States. </p><p>On June 25 Krishna Bahadur Mahara, politburo member and </p><p>Maoist spokesman, decried the "increasing US interference" </p><p>in Nepal, and declared that the USG was "meddling in the </p><p>peace talks."  Mahara, who conceded that the possibility of </p><p>American involvement drove the Maoists to the negotiating </p><p>table, claimed the USG was hatching a conspiracy from behind </p><p>the scenes to disrupt the peace talks. (Note:  The local </p><p>press reported that during a June 18-20 visit to Nepal, </p><p>Lieutenant General James Campbell, Pacific Commander of the </p><p>US Army, assured Nepal of continued US financial and </p><p>political support in its battle against the Maoists. Senior- </p><p>level Maoists have been especially critical of the US </p><p>military presence in Nepal.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, Maoist military chief </p><p>and negotiating team member, also criticized the USG.  On </p><p>June 20, speaking at a Maoist rally in Kathmandu, Badal </p><p>claimed that the United States was trying to disrupt the </p><p>peace talks, and lambasted the inclusion of the Maoists on a </p><p>US terrorist watch list. </p><p> </p><p>UNCERTAINTY LOOMS OVER PEACE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Amid public pressure for continuity in the peace process </p><p>and charges of ceasefire violations, representatives from </p><p>the Government of Nepal\'s (GON) negotiating team and the </p><p>Maoist team still have not set a date for the next round of </p><p>peace negotiations.  Prime Minister Thapa repeatedly has </p><p>said the third round would happen "soon," but has not </p><p>offered a timeframe.  On June 25 Krishna Bahadur Mahara, </p><p>Maoist spokesman, accused the GON of delaying the </p><p>negotiations and demanded that the GON move forward honestly </p><p>with the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Despite the lack of a date for the third round, Prime </p><p>Minister Thapa has outlined an agenda for the fourth round. </p><p>Thapa said that the issue of the RNA\'s restriction to a 5- </p><p>kilometer radius around its barracks would be discussed in </p><p>the fourth round when the GON would give its official </p><p>position on the controversial issue.   Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, Maoist spokesman and negotiating team member, </p><p>retorted that "there is no point in carrying on the talks" </p><p>if the GON does not send the army back to its barracks. </p><p> </p><p>NHRC AWAITS RESPONSE FROM GON </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has still </p><p>not received a response to the human rights accord draft it </p><p>presented to the Prime Minister on June 19.  The NHRC has </p><p>criticized both the GON and the Maoists for not abiding by </p><p>the code of conduct, and the proposal calls for closer </p><p>monitoring of human rights violations and assurance of </p><p>availability of medical treatment, food supplies and </p><p>education.  The Prime Minister said he was studying the </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS HOLD "PEACE" RALLIES; </p><p>FORCE SCHOOLCHILDREN TO ATTEND </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  On June 20 the Maoists, along with the five major </p><p>political parties, held a massive rally in Kathmandu. </p><p>Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman and negotiating </p><p>team member, addressed the crowd and said his party wanted </p><p>reform and permanent peace.  However, the local press </p><p>reported that the majority of the attendees were </p><p>schoolchildren, some younger than ten years old, who were </p><p>forced to attend the rally.  A teacher was quoted as saying </p><p>that the Maoists demanded the students attend the rally, </p><p>causing schools to shut down for half of the day.  Other </p><p>schools declared the day a holiday so that the children </p><p>could stay at home and not be forced to attend the protest. </p><p> </p><p>9.  On June 23 Maoists staged another rally in the south </p><p>western district of Banke that blocked a major highway.  The </p><p>insurgents formed a human chain protesting alleged United </p><p>States interference in Nepal, and also demanded the </p><p>immediate withdrawal of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  In </p><p>Chitwan, Maoist cadres blocked roads throughout the district </p><p>for several hours, demanding that the GON bring peace </p><p>negotiations to a successful conclusion.  The insurgents </p><p>also reiterated the Maoist demands for a round-table </p><p>conference, interim government and constituent assembly. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS IGNORE CEASEFIRE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Maoists continued to violate the ceasefire with the </p><p>abduction of civilians.  Maoist cadres reportedly kidnapped </p><p>the President of the Red Cross Society in Kalikot District </p><p>and two other civilians on June 25.  Their whereabouts are </p><p>unknown.  In Taplejung District insurgents abducted an </p><p>employee of the transportation association on June 25 for </p><p>remarrying and imprisoned his new wife. </p><p> </p><p>11.  In Sarlahi District Maoists dragged two civilians from </p><p>their house on June 23 in the early morning and brutally </p><p>beat one of them to death and seriously injured the other. </p><p>Security forces in the area reportedly have said they will </p><p>not remain "mute spectators," warning that the insurgents </p><p>will face stiff action by the security forces.  Maoists in </p><p>the region reportedly took responsibility for the murder, </p><p>but said the incident "could be an accident."  Two young </p><p>children were killed by a bomb in Rukum District, a Maoist </p><p>stronghold.  The bomb reportedly was hidden by insurgents </p><p>and exploded while the children were playing with it. </p><p> </p><p>12.  In another display of violence, on June 20 a group of </p><p>insurgents in Dolakha severely beat a schoolteacher after he </p><p>refused to give them money.  According to the Society of </p><p>Maoist Displaced Teachers, a local association, Maoists have </p><p>killed nine teachers since the declaration of the ceasefire </p><p>and injured thirteen others.  Many teachers are refusing to </p><p>return to schools outside district headquarters because of </p><p>inadequate security. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoists in Rukum District took control of a micro-hydro </p><p>project on June 24 after management refused to provide them </p><p>with several thousand dollars in "donations."  Electricity </p><p>also reportedly has been disrupted in other parts of the </p><p>district due to the Maoists.  According to the managing </p><p>director of the micro-hydro project, only five Village </p><p>Development Committees (VDC) out of forty-three have access </p><p>to electricity, and operations cannot continue without </p><p>adequate security. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ISSUE WARNINGS OVER HEALTH CAMPS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists reportedly have threatened to cut off the hands </p><p>and legs of those who defy orders not to attend health camps </p><p>conducted by the RNA.  According to press accounts, Maoist </p><p>cadres in the far-western regions have warned that attendees </p><p>of the camps would have their legs and hands chopped off </p><p>after the army leaves.  As a result of the threats, it is </p><p>estimated that hundreds of people are being deprived of </p><p>medical treatment out of fear of retaliation by the </p><p>insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>15.  On June 21 seven armed Maoists reportedly were killed </p><p>by RNA personnel in the far-western district of Jajarkot </p><p>during an exchange of gunfire.  The insurgents reportedly </p><p>opened fire on the convoy which was arriving to set up a </p><p>camp for medical and other services in the region (Reftel). </p><p>On June 26 a Maoist cadre was killed by army personnel in </p><p>Bhojpur District after attempting to disrupt assistance to a </p><p>school in the district. </p><p> </p><p>RNA OUTREACH EFFORTS BRANDED A SUCCESS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The humanitarian assistance provided by the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) has enjoyed significant success, despite </p><p>opposition from Maoists.  According to figures published in </p><p>the local press, over 130,000 people in rural areas have </p><p>received some form of assistance, including medical and </p><p>veterinary treatment, agricultural training and citizenship </p><p>and passport services.  In addition, over forty thousand </p><p>dollars in medicine was distributed free of charge.  The </p><p>outreach efforts were aimed at some of the most remote </p><p>districts of Nepal, particularly those hit hardest by the </p><p>Maoist insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>17.  On June 24 the RNA held relief and health camps in </p><p>Jumla District, benefiting over 1400 people, and on June 23 </p><p>RNA soldiers organized a health camp in Dailekh District, </p><p>providing medical examinations and distributing medicines, </p><p>and assistance with such administrative matters as </p><p>passports.  Maoist cadres reportedly also received treatment </p><p>at the camp. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
