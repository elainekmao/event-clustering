(U) MFA Ambassador for Iraq Reconstruction Issues Ahmed </p><p>Rifat Okcun called in Econ Counselor April 21 on Turkish </p><p>Red Crescent (TRC) plans to visit Iraq to discuss </p><p>assistance for hospitals with the Iraqi Red Crescent.

MDRO advised </p><p>TRC and MFA that the HOC should be notified 96 hours in </p><p>advance of any movements by humanitarian organizations. </p><p>TRC and MFA agreed to postpone the visit until May 26 and </p><p>to provide further details of the delegation\'s itinerary </p><p>to MDRO.  Embassy will provide delegation details by fax </p><p>to the Kuwait Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ozturk said that the International Committee of </p><p>the Red Cross (ICRC) has not been informed of this trip, </p><p>but that TRC would brief ICRC, MFA and the Embassy after </p><p>the return of the delegation. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
