A TEAM LED BY AMBASSADOR TONY HALL VISITED MALAWI OCTOBER </p><p>11-13 AND FOUND THAT RELIEF PROGRAMS TO ALLEVIATE HUNGER AND </p><p>THE SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGE ARE PROGRESSING WELL, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>NEED TO EXPAND AND ACCELERATE OPERATIONS REMAINS AS MORE AND </p><p>MORE HOUSEHOLDS GO WITHOUT FOOD. NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION WILL REQUIRE RELIEF ASSISTANCE OVER </p><p>THE PERIOD JANUARY-MARCH 2003 (3.3 MILLION). THE FOOD CRISIS </p><p>HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY HIV/AIDS AND POVERTY. DESPITE A WELL-ORGANIZED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE,  LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS </p><p>ARE SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SERIOUSLY DISRUPT </p><p>THE TIMELY FLOW OF RELIEF FOOD.

AMBASSADOR TONY HALL, US MISSION TO ROME; HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ATTACHE TIM LAVELLE; AND SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>MAX FINBERG, VISITED MALAWI OCTOBER 11-13. IN ADDITION TO </p><p>MEETINGS IN LILONGWE WITH U.S. EMBASSY/USAID, UN AND GOM </p><p>FUNCTIONARIES, THE TEAM SPENT ONE DAY IN THE RURAL </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE REVIEWING UN AND NGO RELIEF OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. MALAWI IS A SMALL, LANDLOCKED COUNTRY WHICH IS DENSELY </p><p>POPULATED (10.5 MILLION PEOPLE), POVERTY-STRICKEN AND ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. MALAWI, WHICH </p><p>HAS INITIATED AN ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA, FACES CHALLENGES ON </p><p>SEVERAL FRONTS, AMONG THEM A RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION, </p><p>LIMITED NATURAL RESOURCES, HIGH LEVELS OF INEQUALITY, AND </p><p>THE CORROSIVE EFFECTS OF RECURRING DROUGHTS, POOR RESOURCE </p><p>MANAGEMENT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. IN LATE 2000, </p><p>MALAWI WAS APPROVED FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER THE HEAVILY </p><p>INDEBTED POOR COUNTRIES (HIPC) PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>4. MOREOVER, MALAWI HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST HIV/AIDS RATES ON </p><p>THE CONTINENT (31 PERCENT HIV PREVALENCE FOR WOMEN IN ANTI- </p><p>NATAL CLINICS COMPARED TO A 12 PERCENT AVERAGE IN SUB- </p><p>SAHARAN AFRICA). AT THE END OF 2001, THERE WERE 850,000 </p><p>PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS IN MALAWI, OF WHOM 7.5 PERCENT </p><p>WERE CHILDREN. APPROXIMATELY 16.5 PERCENT OF THE ADULT </p><p>POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO BE INFECTED. THE LEADING CAUSE OF </p><p>ADULT DEATH, AIDS HAS SERIOUSLY IMPACTED ON THE REDUCTION IN </p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY FROM 52 TO 37 YEARS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE MORE THAN 500,000 ORPHANS WHO HAVE LOST AT LEAST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05133  01 OF 04  220735Z </p><p>ONE PARENT. THE  DFID REPRESENTATIVE, THE UK\'S AID AGENCY, </p><p>OBSERVED THAT "AS MUCH AS 75 PERCENT OF THE DISCRETIONARY </p><p>BUDGET OF MANY GOM MINISTRIES GOES TO FUNERAL EXPENSES FOR </p><p>THEIR EMPLOYEES." EACH USG EMPLOYEE WE MET IN COUNTRY HAD </p><p>RECENTLY ATTENDED A FUNERAL. THE STARK CONNECTION BETWEEN </p><p>THE CURRENT FOOD CRISIS AND THE ALARMING HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC </p><p>WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN ONE NGO STAFF\'S QUOTE: "POVERTY TAKES </p><p>AWAY HOPE, SO WHY NOT HAVE SEX?" </p><p> </p><p>5. MALNUTRITION AMONG CHILDREN IS ENDEMIC (AROUND 30 PERCENT </p><p>OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE ARE UNDERWEIGHT). </p><p> </p><p>6. THE WORLD BANK/IMF POINT OUT THAT "WHILE MALAWI HAS A </p><p>NUMBER OF SAFETY NET PROGRAMS, THESE HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>INTEGRATED INTO A COORDINATED STRATEGY (AND HENCE) AS A </p><p>RESULT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS ARE CHARACTERIZED </p><p>BY A DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS, GAPS IN COVERAGE, AND COST </p><p>INEFFECTIVENESS." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CURRENT HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1095 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05133  02 OF 04  220735Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   ANHR-00  E-00     UTED-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      IO-00    NEA-00   NSCE-00  OIC-02   P-00     SS-00    TEST-00 </p><p>      SA-00    PRM-00   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------FC0C28  220739Z /38 </p><p>P 220649Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY LILONGWE PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6457 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC PRIORITY 2335 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2861 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 005133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE FOR AMBASSADOR MEECE AND USAID DIRECTOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05133  02 OF 04  220735Z </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, DCHA/FFP, </p><p>USAID/GLOBAL/HEALTH, SA/KPOE AND CWHAGELMAN </p><p>STATE FOR U/S GROSSMAN, U/S LARSON, IO ACTING A/S WOOD, A/S </p><p>PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, AFR/SA </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, RTILSWORTH AND LREICH </p><p>NSC FOR JWDORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EAGR, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR TONY P. HALL IN MALAWI - "THE JOURNEY IS </p><p>FAR FROM OVER" </p><p> </p><p>7. DUE TO DROUGHT AND FLOODS (FEBRUARY 2002), THE 2002 </p><p>HARVEST TURNED OUT TO BE 28 PERCENT BELOW THE FIVE-YEAR </p><p>AVERAGE, AND SIX PERCENT LOWER THAN 2001. MAIZE IMPORT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS IN 2002/2003 (APRIL/MARCH) WERE CALCULATED BY </p><p>THE FAO/WFP MISSION AT 433,000 TONS, INCLUDING 225,000 TONS </p><p>OF COMMERCIAL IMPORTS AND 208,000 TONS OF FOOD AID. (THE </p><p>FOOD AID NUMBER HAS NOW BEEN FURTHER RATCHETED UP TO 236,500 </p><p>MTS.) ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE, MANY PRIVATE TRADERS HAVE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAWN FROM MAJOR IMPORTATION DUE TO THE COST </p><p>OF FINANCE (LOCAL INTEREST RATES ABOUT 50 PERCENT), </p><p>UNCERTAINTIES OVER THE USD/MALAWI KWACHA EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>(CURRENTLY 80MK = USD 1) AND UNCERTAINTIES OVER GOVERNMENT </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN PRICE CONTROLS. GOVERNMENT HAS THEREFORE, AS </p><p>IN 2001, ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMERCIAL GRAIN (MAIZE) </p><p>IMPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. NOTE: OVER THE PAST 10-15 YEARS, MALAWI HAS SHIFTED FROM </p><p>BEING A NATIONALLY SELF-SUFFICIENT PRODUCER OF MAIZE IN NON- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05133  02 OF 04  220735Z </p><p>DROUGHT YEARS TO BEING DEPENDENT ON COMMERCIAL FOOD IMPORTS </p><p>AND FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL FOOD BALANCE. </p><p>END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>9. FROM JUNE 2001 LOCAL MAIZE PRICES ROSE DRAMATICALLY. OVER </p><p>THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, PRICES HAVE DROPPED AND BEGUN TO </p><p>STABILIZE BETWEEN M/10-M/15/KG., WHICH IS 50 PERCENT HIGHER </p><p>THAN LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME. MANY HOUSEHOLDS OVERSTRETCHED </p><p>THEIR COPING MECHANISMS LAST YEAR, REDUCING THEIR RESILIENCE </p><p>AND INCREASING THEIR VULNERABILITY IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED </p><p>FOOD SHORTAGES. </p><p> </p><p>10. DESPITE WIDESPREAD REPORTS THAT THE SALE OF GOM\'S </p><p>STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE LAST YEAR CAUSED THE PRESENT </p><p>SHORTAGES, USAID REFUTED THESE ARGUMENTS. WHILE NOT </p><p>DISMISSING SOME POSSIBILITY OF CORRUPTION, THE SALE OF </p><p>167,000 METRIC TONS OF MAIZE THIS PAST YEAR HAD SOME </p><p>JUSTIFICATION, INCLUDING AGE OF THE STOCK IN STORAGE, </p><p>STORAGE COSTS, AND LACK OF INDICATION OF MAJOR CROP </p><p>SHORTFALLS FOR 2002. WHILE THE GOM-HELD MAIZE RESERVE MIGHT </p><p>HAVE HELPED THE FOOD CRUNCH THIS YEAR, THE AMOUNT SOLD WAS </p><p>TOO MODEST TO HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE </p><p>PRESENT CONTEXT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHAT THE TEAM SAW </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. ON OCTOBER 12 THE TEAM VISITED A NUMBER OF SITES IN </p><p>SALIMA DISTRICT AND SPOKE WITH A NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES, </p><p>UN, GOM AND NGO STAFF. IN THE FIELD, USAID AND OTHER DONORS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05133  02 OF 04  220735Z </p><p>ARE WORKING THROUGH WFP AND A CONSORTIUM OF NGOS UNDER THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF CARE. TWELVE NGOS HAVE TAKEN UP THE DISTRICT </p><p>CO-ORDINATION ROLE IN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>12. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE PROBLEM OF FOOD INSECURITY RUNS </p><p>DEEP IN MALAWI, AND WILL REQUIRE A LONG-TERM FOCUS. </p><p>PARTICULARLY MENACING IS THE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC. WE VISITED A </p><p>CENTER RUN BY A LOCAL NGO, SALIMA AIDS SUPPORT ORGANIZATION </p><p>(SASO), AT CHANKUNGU. BEGUN IN 2000 WITH 60 ORPHANS (WHO </p><p>RECEIVE WEEKLY FOOD SUPPLEMENTS AND CHILD-CARE), THE NUMBER </p><p>OF CHILDREN PRESENTLY ENROLLED EQUALS 604. THE CENTER\'S </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR TOLD US THAT THE DISTRICT CONTAINED 1,426 </p><p>CHILDREN WHO HAD LOST ONE OR MORE PARENTS, LARGELY DUE TO </p><p>AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>13. WE SAW A GENERAL RELIEF FOOD DISTRIBUTION NEAR SALIMA, </p><p>MANAGED BY SAVE/UK. A NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES REPORTED THAT </p><p>THEY HAD CUT DOWN THEIR FOOD CONSUMPTION TO ONE MEAL A DAY. </p><p>WE INQUIRED OF MANY CHILDREN AS TO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME </p><p>THEY HAD EATEN A MEAL.

WE </p><p>WERE INFORMED THAT NUTRITION REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>SUPPORTING AN AVERAGE 35,000 CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE WOMEN </p><p>PER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>14. UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH. RURAL WAGES FOR CASUAL LABOR ARE </p><p>ON THE ORDER OF 30 TO 60 KWACHA PER DAY (I.E., ROUGHLY U.S. </p><p>.38 TO .75 CENTS). WE WERE TOLD THAT MOST OF THE POPULATION </p><p>IS NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE FULL COMMERCIAL PRICE FOR A BAG OF </p><p>MAIZE. THE GOM\'S ANSWER IS UNIVERSALLY SUBSIDIZING THE PRICE </p><p>OF MAIZE AT AROUND 17 KWACHA (U.S. .21 CENTS/KILO), MEANING </p><p>THAT THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE COMMERCIAL MAIZE </p><p>ARE ALSO BENEFITING FROM THE SUBSIDY. NOTE: OVER THE PERIOD </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002-MARCH 2003, THE GOM HOPES TO IMPORT 250,000 </p><p>MTS (FINANCED BY COMMERCIAL LOANS). THE GOM WILL NOT PROVIDE </p><p>OR DISTRIBUTE HUMANITARIAN FOOD SUPPLIES, WHETHER FOR NORMAL </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OR FOR FEEDING PROGRAMS (THEY EXPECT </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THIS).

MALAWI NEEDS A BETTER SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING AREAS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY DUE TO LOWER THAN NORMAL PRODUCTION AND/OR AN </p><p>UNEXPECTED FALL IN PURCHASING POWER. AS OF NOW, THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE EMPIRICAL BASIS FOR TARGETING FOOD AID, INSOFAR AS </p><p>DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION ON HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY IS </p><p>LACKING. </p><p> </p><p>16. THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER RATIONALIZATION AND </p><p>PRIORITIZATION OF BOTH NEW AND EXISTING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>17. MALAWI WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM A REGULAR TITLE II </p><p>FEEDING PROGRAM, WHICH SHOULD BE DIRECTLY COORDINATED </p><p>THROUGH USAID/MALAWI. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS A COMPELLING </p><p>NEED TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF UNDER-NUTRITION IN </p><p>INFANTS AND EXPECTANT MOTHERS. UNLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH </p><p>AS INDIA, MALAWI HAS NO PROGRAM THAT DELIVERS A COMBINATION </p><p>OF SERVICES (FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, MICRO-NUTRIENTS, HEALTH </p><p>INPUTS, IMMUNIZATIONS, ETC.) TARGETED TO THE MOST </p><p>NUTRITIONALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS IN THE POPULATION (E.G., </p><p>INFANTS AND PREGNANT WOMEN). </p><p> </p><p>18. THE LONG-TERM VALUE OF EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY FOR </p><p>GIRLS, TO IMPROVED NUTRITION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS CANNOT </p><p>BE OVERSTATED. IN THIS CONTEXT, SCHOOL FEEDING INTERVENTIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY RATCHETED UP.

BOTH THE UN AND NGOS NEED TO QUICKLY INTENSIFY AND </p><p>EXPAND ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN HIV/AIDS INFORMATION </p><p>CAMPAIGNS, CARE FOR ORPHANS, AND TRAINING FOR SERVICE </p><p>PROVIDERS TO BETTER MANAGE THIS TERRIBLE SCOURGE. </p><p> </p><p>20. WFP AND THE UN AGENCIES SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOOD </p><p>DELIVERIES (WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF BENEFICIARIES OFTEN WAIT </p><p>FOR HOURS TO RECEIVE THEIR RATION) TO IMPART MOTHER-CHILD </p><p>CARE HEALTH TRAINING AND NUTRITION EDUCATION MESSAGES, </p><p>HIV/AIDS AWARENESS, ETC. WITHOUT MORE COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING HIV/AIDS, FOOD AID ALONE WILL </p><p>HARDLY PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE ALL DESIRE. </p><p> </p><p>21. MALAWI IS LIKELY GOING TO BE A NET IMPORTER OF MAIZE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE, BUT THIS NEED NOT BE VIEWED AS A FAILURE. THE UN </p><p>(PARTICULARLY FAO) SHOULD ASSIST WITH DIVERSIFICATION INTO </p><p>HIGHER-VALUE CROPS, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT MONO FOCUS ON </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCTION.
