<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004591 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: AMBASSADOR\'S JULY 21 FAREWELL CALL ON </p><p>ANKARA MAYOR GOKCEK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson. </p><p>Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador paid a farewell call July 21 on I. Melih </p><p>Gokcek, long-time and currently independent Mayor of Ankara. </p><p>Gokcek provided his view on recent U.S.-Turkey tensions and </p><p>how to repair them.  Gokcek observed that anti-Americanism is </p><p>on the rise and risks becoming a permanent, and decisive, </p><p>feature of Turkish-American political relations in the wake </p><p>of the July 4 incident in Suleimaniyah.  He noted that the </p><p>skyrocketing sales of Cola Turka (a new product marketed by </p><p>the Ulker company, long associated with culturally </p><p>conservative political circles) are a direct result of the </p><p>strong sense of wounded Turkish national pride felt on the </p><p>streets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador thanked Gokcek, and noted at length that </p><p>the USG had, in fact, good reason to believe that Turkish </p><p>Special Forces troops in Suleimaniyah had been preparing to </p><p>take action inimical to stability in Iraq.  The point </p><p>immediately registered with, and was understood by, Gokcek, </p><p>who then observed that the AK Government is facing strong </p><p>pressure from three sources: 1) the USG; 2) the Turkish </p><p>General Staff (TGS); and 3) the Turkish public.  The </p><p>Government has to take into account all three pressure </p><p>centers without offending any of them.   Speaking candidly, </p><p>Gokcek observed that "if the AK Government offends the USG, </p><p>we know our economy will be in trouble.  If it offend the </p><p>TGS, you know better than I do just what will happen.  If AK </p><p>offends the voters it will be finished politically."   He </p><p>added that if relations continue to sour as a result of the </p><p>July 4 or similar incidents, the GOT will have to choose </p><p>sides with "either of the two domestic groups" -- the Turkish </p><p>people or the TGS.  Absent a signal of friendship from the </p><p>U.S. directly to the Turkish people, things risked getting </p><p>worse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Local Politics </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Speaking of the voters, Gokcek observed that the </p><p>public as a rule "only remembers what you\'ve done in your </p><p>last year of office" -- right before elections.  He referred </p><p>in that vein to the numerous road-building and other </p><p>construction/urban renewal projects currently underway across </p><p>Ankara.  He downplayed speculation that Turkey will head this </p><p>fall to nation-wide local elections (mandatory by April </p><p>2004), noting that President Sezer seems to be in veto-mode </p><p>and is likely to try to veto any election law that comes down </p><p>the pike -- thus at the very least delaying or otherwise </p><p>complicating any fall election time-table that might be under </p><p>consideration.  Gokcek offered nonchalantly that "I\'ll </p><p>probably be joining AK in a few weeks," dismissing the </p><p>possibility that Kecioren Mayor Turgut Altinok will challenge </p><p>him for the ruling AK Party\'s Ankara mayoral nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Gokcek is a keen political observer and ambitious </p><p>operator who makes it his business to keep abreast of what is </p><p>on the voter\'s minds -- and understands his potential value </p><p>to P.M./AK Chairman Erdogan as a successful mayor of Turkey\'s </p><p>capital and second largest city as the local election </p><p>campaign kicks off.  A nationalist at heart, Gokcek </p><p>nevertheless has long looked askance at the TGS, and has long </p><p>opposed its dominant role in politics and policy-making.  In </p><p>this context, it is worth underscoring Gokcek\'s suggestion </p><p>that they way to assuage wounded Turkish pride is by an </p><p>appeal to the electorate rather than to the TGS -- which, </p><p>while certainly feeling the sting, has its own agenda and </p><p>reasons for portraying itself as the guardian of Turkish </p><p>national honor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Though extremely well-informed about national </p><p>politics, reflecting his aspirations for a national </p><p>leadership role, Gokcek is still for now keeping his feet </p><p>firmly on local ground.  During the Q and A with the press </p><p>before the private meeting, only one question was asked to </p><p>the Ambassador -- by a Gokcek staffer seeking his comment on </p><p>the quality of city services. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
