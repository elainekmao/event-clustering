<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 08 MOGADISHU 01175 </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/IDN DEBORAH ROCHA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/ODF FOR CHARLES ENGLISH </p><p>AID/PPC/EA FOR KEN KAUFMANN </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR MFO/MILLIKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EAID, SO </p><p>SUBJ: ECONOMIC POLICY PROFILE:  SOMALIA </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) 84 STATE 369917    B) 84 MOGADISHU 1091 </p><p> </p><p>1.  ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICIES: </p><p>- </p><p>2.  RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE:  SOMALIA IS A LARGE, </p><p>SPARSELY SETTLED COUNTRY OF 5 MILLION PEOPLE, WHOSE </p><p>MAJOR RESOURCES ARE ITS LAND AND LOCATION.  SITUATED </p><p>ADJACENT TO THE MARKETS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND </p><p>WITHIN EASY SHIPPING RANGE OF EUROPE, SOMALIA POSSESSES </p><p>A LAND AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 64 MILLION HECTARES. </p><p>OF THIS, ABOUT 8.2 MILLION HECTARES ARE ARABLE, BUT, </p><p>WITH WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LABOR LIMITING FACTORS </p><p>ONLY ABOUT 900,000 HECTARES ARE UNDER CULTIVATION.  OF </p><p>THE REMAINING LAND, ABOUT 60 PERCENT IS SUTIABLE FOR </p><p>GRAZING WITH THE BALANCE WASTE.  ITS FISHING POTENTIAL </p><p>AND MINERAL RESOURCES REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN AND UN- </p><p>EXPLOITED, THOUGH SIX FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN SURVEYS AND EXPLORATION.  THE </p><p>NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE  BASE IS WEAK, WITH ONLY TWO </p><p>MAJOR URBAN CENTERS (MOGADISHU AND HARGEISA), THREE </p><p>DEEPWATER PORTS (MOGADISHU, KISMAYO AND BERBERA), A </p><p>POORLY DEVELOPED INTERNAL ROAD NETWORK, AND NO RAILROAD. </p><p>PUBLIC UTILITY, EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE </p><p>LARGELY CONFINED TO THE MAJOR CITIES.  THE HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCE BASE IS ALSO WEAK, WITH MANAGERIAL AND </p><p>TECHNICAL SKILLS PARTICULARLY SCARCE. </p><p>- </p><p>3. STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY:  THE ECONOMY IS DOMINATED </p><p>BY THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, AND WITHIN AGRICULTURE BY </p><p>LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION.  OVERALL GDP (AT CURRENT MARKET </p><p>PRICES) WAS ABOUT US DOLS 1.3 BILLION IN 1983; WITH A </p><p>POPULATION (INCLUDING REFUGEES) OF 5 MILLION, PER </p><p>CAPITA GDP WAS ABOUT US DOLS 260.  LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION </p><p>NORMALLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 38 PERCENT OF GDP; 50-60 </p><p>PERCENT OF TOTAL EMPLOYMENT AND 80 PERCENT OF EXPORT </p><p>EARNINGS.  CROP PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 7-10 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP, WITH BANANAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT EXPORT </p><p>CROP, AND SORGHUM, MAIZE AND SESAME GROWN FOR LOCAL </p><p>CONSUMPTION.  THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS SMALL </p><p>(7 PERCENT OF GDP), INEFFICIENT, AND DOMINATED BY </p><p>38 PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WHICH NOW ACCOUNT FOR 80 PER- </p><p>CENT OF ALL VALUE ADDED IN MANUFACTURING.  DESPITE </p><p>CHANGES UNDERWAY, SERVICES ARE STILL DOMINATED BY </p><p>PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WITH BANKING, INSURANCE AND </p><p>PORTIONS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE THE PROVINCE OF </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES.  REMITTANCES REMAIN AN </p><p>IMPORTANT FACTOR IN NATIONAL INCOME, WITH TRANSFERS </p><p>FROM 100,000 SOMALIS NOW WORKING IN THE GULF ACCOUNT- </p><p>ING IN PAST YEARS FOR UP TO ONE-THIRD OF SOMALIA\'S </p><p>TOTAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>RELATIVELY STABLE.  IN PLACE FOR 15 YEARS, WITH THE </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES UNDER FIRM CONTROL, IT HAS THUS FAR </p><p>WEATHERED SUCCESSFULLY DROUGHTS, WARS AND REFUGEE </p><p>CRISES, AND, MORE RECENTLY, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY </p><p>PRESSURES ON THE BORDER AND ATTACKS ON NORTHERN </p><p>TERRITORIES BY DISSIDENT  GROUPS   BASED IN ETHIOPIA. </p><p>- </p><p>4. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS:  SOMALIA\'S OVERALL </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS DETERIORATED BADLY OVER THE </p><p>PAST TWO YEARS AS A SERIES OF BLOWS TO ITS EXTERNAL </p><p>ACCOUNT HAVE COMBINED WITH BURGEONING FISCAL DEFICITS </p><p>TO RECREATE THE LOW GROWTH, HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENT </p><p>THAT HAD PREVAILED IN THE LATE 1970S.  WITH EXPORT </p><p>EARNINGS CUT TO LESS THAN HALF THEIR 1982 LEVEL </p><p>(LARGELY AS A RESULT OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S 1983 BAN ON </p><p>CATTLE IMPORTS FROM AFRICA) AND FOREIGN AID FINANCING </p><p>DOWN 18 PERCENT FROM ITS 1982 PEAK, SOMALIA CLOSED </p><p>1984 WITH ITS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE OVERALL BALANCE OF </p><p>PAYMENTS DEFICIT, A NEGATIVE NET FOREIGN ASSETS </p><p>POSITION AND GROSS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES EQUAL TO </p><p>BARELY SIX WEEKS OF CASH FINANCED IMPORTS.  DEPRESSED </p><p>BY IMPORT SHORTAGES AND WEAK RAINS, REAL GDP GROWTH </p><p>IN 1983 SLIPPED TO ONLY 1 PERCENT AND SEEMS IN 1984 </p><p>LIKELY TO HAVE TOTALLED NO MORE THAN 1 TO 2 PERCENT, </p><p>EVEN WITH STRONG RAINS AND RECORD CROP PRODUCTION. </p><p>INFLATION, MEANWHILE, HAS SOARED, RISING FROM AN </p><p>AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF 24 PERCENT IN 1982 TO 36 PER- </p><p>CENT IN 1983 AND 93 PERCENT IN 1984. </p><p>- </p><p>5. LOOKING AHEAD TO 1985, PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND </p><p>PRICE STABILITY WILL DEPEND UPON THE WEATHER, </p><p>SOMALIA\'S SUCCESS IN MUSTERING INTERNATIONAL AID </p><p>SUPPORT FOR ITS PROPOSED IMF STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE ECONOMIC REFORM PROCESS.  IF THE </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITMENT IS FIRM, THE RAINS ADEQUATE, </p><p>AID SUPPORT SUFFICIENT, SOMALIA MAY BE ABLE TO WORK </p><p>THROUGH ITS PROPOSED STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT TOWARDS </p><p>CONSISTENT, EXPORT LED GROWTH.  IF NOT, SOMALIA </p><p>COULD WELL REMAIN TRAPPED WITHIN THE LOW GROWTH, </p><p>HIGH INFLATION VORTEX INTO WHICH IT STUMBLED IN </p><p>1983 AND 1984. </p><p>- </p><p>6. ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE, A WORLD BANK SPONSORED </p><p>CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING ON SOMALIA IN OCTOBER </p><p>1983 PROVIDED THE STIMULUS FOR AN INITIAL REVIEW OF </p><p>SOMALIA\'S PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WHICH THE WORLD </p><p>BANK HAS SINCE FOLLOWED UP WITH STAFF VISITS </p><p>THROUGHOUT 1984.  AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 1985, THE </p><p>RESULT OF THESE REPEATED REVIEWS IS A PUBLIC INVEST- </p><p>MENT PROGRAM LARGELY FREE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANTS </p><p>THAT HAD PLAGUED PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT PLANS, BUT </p><p>STILL OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE COUNTRY\'S REAL FISCAL </p><p>AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES.  RETURNS ON IN- </p><p>VESTMENT HAVE BEEN ABSURDLY LOW OVER THE PAST 13 </p><p>YEARS (BELOW 6.7 PERCENT PER ANNUM ON AVERAGE TO JUDGE </p><p>FROM GDP GROWTH AND NATIONAL INVESTMENT RATES) AND </p><p>LIKELY WILL REMAIN LOW IN COMING YEARS, IF MORE CARE- </p><p>FUL CONTROL IS NOT EXERTED OVER THE DISTRIBUTION AND </p><p>USE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS.  A SECOND CONSULTATIVE GROUP </p><p>MEETING NOW TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 1985 </p><p>WILL PROVIDE DONORS WITH A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO  IN- </p><p>FLUENCE THIS PROCESS. </p><p>- </p><p>7. POLICY FRAMEWORK:  SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT </p><p>STEPS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>INCENTIVES, OPPORTUNITIES AND FREE OPERATING </p><p>ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A </p><p>MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC SYSTEM.  IT HAS ENDED </p><p>PRICE CONTROLS, VIRTUALLY ABOLISHED IMPORT AND EXPORT </p><p>LICENSING, DEVALUED REPEATEDLY (BY A TOTAL OF 83 PER- </p><p>CENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TERMS), AND, IN JANUARY 1985, </p><p>ESTABLISHED A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET WITH A </p><p>FREE AND LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET FOR MOST FOREIGN EX- </p><p>CHANGE TRANSACTIONS.  IT HAS ALSO BOOSTED BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM LOAN AND DEPOSIT RATES BY 8 TO 10 POINTS (IN </p><p>TWO STAGES OVER THREE YEARS), AND COMPLETELY LIBERAL- </p><p>IZED INTERNAL FOODGRAIN MARKETING.  HOWEVER, IT HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY BACK THESE REFORMS </p><p>WITH THE REQUISITE FISCAL AND MONETARY DISCIPLINE. </p><p>REAL INTEREST RATES REMAIN NEGATIVE, AND THE EFFECTS </p><p>OF PAST DEVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY WIPED OUT </p><p>BY EXCESSIVE MONETARY EXPANSION.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>ALSO BEEN SLOW TO ATTACK INTERNAL MONOPOLY POSITIONS. </p><p>WHILE IT HAS ENDED MOST PUBLIC SECTOR TRADING MONO- </p><p>POLIES, IT HAS LEFT IN PLACE MONOPOLIES IN BANKING, </p><p>INSURANCE, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  IT HAS ALSO LEFT IN PLACE AN UNREALISTIC </p><p>(THOUGH LARGELY UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WMICH OFFICIALLY </p><p>DEPRIVES EMPLOYERS OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE AS </p><p>THEY PLEASE.  OVERALL, THEREFORE, WHILE SOMALIA HAS </p><p>TAKEN MANY OF THE BASIC AND MOST CRITICAL STEPS TOWARDS </p><p>A FREELY OPERATING MARKET ECONOMY OVER THE PAST THREE </p><p>YEARS, IT STILL NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE TASK WITH </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS IN INTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND IMPROVE- </p><p>MENTS IN GENERAL PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>8. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATES) </p><p> </p><p>-                                  1972-1980   1981-1983 </p><p> </p><p>REAL PER CAPITA INCOME (1)          - 2.7         2.4 </p><p>MONEY (M1)                           23.0        14.6 </p><p>SAVINGS AND TIME DEPOSITS </p><p>-     (QUASI-MONEY)                  25.6        23.0 </p><p>TAXES/GDP                            12.7        14.2 </p><p>CONSUMER PRICES                      17.7        34.7 </p><p> </p><p>-  (1) REAL PER CAPITA GDP AT MARKET PRICES FOR </p><p>-      NON-REFUGEE POPULATION </p><p>- </p><p>9. POLICY INDICATORS </p><p> </p><p>10. MONEY SUPPLY:  FISCAL DEFICITS, ONLY PARTIALLY </p><p>OFFSET BY CONSEQUENTIAL DECLINES IN NET FOREIGN ASSETS, </p><p>HAVE PROVIDED THE MAJOR IMPETUS FOR MONEY SUPPLY </p><p>GROWTH IN SOMALIA OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. </p><p>THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS PATTERN WAS DURING THE 1981 </p><p>TO 1983 PERIOD, WHEN, UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF A SERIES </p><p>OF IMF PROGRAMS, NEW NET CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR VIRTUALLY ALL MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH.  WHEN </p><p>SOMALIA\'S IMF PROGRAMS LAPSED IN 1984, HOWEVER, </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEMAND FOR CREDIT REASSERTED ITSELF, ALONE </p><p>ACCOUNTING FOR TWO-THIRDS OF A 72 PERCENT INCREASE IN </p><p>NET DOMESTIC CREDIT DURING THE YEAR\'S FIRST NINE </p><p>MONTHS. </p><p>- </p><p>11. MONEY SUPPLY DETERMINANTS:  CHANGE IN OUTSTANDING </p><p>-   STOCKS (SO.SH. MILLIONS) </p><p> </p><p>-                                1972-80    1981-1983 </p><p> </p><p>M1                                2342.7      1526.3 </p><p>NET DOMESTIC CREDIT TO </p><p>-   THE GOVERNMENT                1927.2     -  97.4 </p><p>NET DOMESTIC CREDIT TO </p><p>-   PUBLIC ENTERPRISES            1513.0     - 388.1 </p><p>NET DOMESTIC CREDIT TO </p><p>-   THE PRIVATE SECTOR             111.0      1866.7 </p><p>NET FOREIGN ASSETS               - 156.1     -2372.4 </p><p>- </p><p>12. MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS:  SOMALIA OPERATES </p><p>A RELATIVELY SIMPLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF </p><p>A CENTRAL BANK, A COMMERCIAL BANK, A DEVELOPMENT </p><p>BANK AND A SINGLE INSURANCE COMPANY, ALL GOVERNMENT </p><p>OWNED.  THE CENTRAL BANK TENDS TO RELY UPON QUANTI- </p><p>TATIVE CONTROLS ON CREDIT ALLOCATIONS TO CONTROL </p><p>THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THE CENTRAL BANK ALSO HAS POWERS </p><p>TO FIX INTEREST RATES AND ADJUST COMMERCIAL BANK </p><p>RESERVE REQUIREMENTS (NOW 10 PERCENT).  HOWEVER, IT </p><p>HAS NOT ADJUSTED RESERVE REQUIREMENTS SINCE 1972, </p><p>AND INTEREST RATES, WHILE ADJUSTED UPWARDS IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS, REMAIN NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS AND INEFFECTIVE </p><p>IN CONTROLLING THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THERE IS NO MONEY </p><p>MARKET OR OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA. </p><p>- </p><p>13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND MARKET POLICIES: </p><p>SOMALIA NOW OPERATES A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>MARKET.  THE OFFICIAL MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED </p><p>BY GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND LOANS AND 35 PERCENT OF </p><p>ALL EXPORT EARNINGS, PROVIDES FINANCING FOR ALL </p><p>DEBT AND OTHER OFFICIAL SERVICE PAYMENTS AND FOR </p><p>ALL PUBLIC SECTOR OIL IMPORTS.  THE EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>IN THIS MARKET IS NOW 36:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS) </p><p>AND IS ADJUSTED UPWARDS MONTHLY BY HALF A SHILLING </p><p>PLUS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN SOMALIA\'S CONSUMER </p><p>PRICE INDEX AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE IN- </p><p>FLATION RATES OF THE FIVE SDR BASKET CURRENCIES. </p><p>- </p><p>14.  ALL OTHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS; I.E., </p><p>ALL TRANSACTIONS NOT SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE </p><p>OFFICIAL MARKET, ARE COVERED IN A LEGAL PARALLEL </p><p>MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED BY PRIVATE TRANSFERS AND </p><p>RETAINED EXPORT EARNINGS (65 PERCENT OF ALL EARN- </p><p>INGS).  ALL TRANSACTIONS IN THIS MARKET TAKE PLACE </p><p>THROUGH FOREIGN AND LOCAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK, WHICH CAN BE OPENED </p><p>BY ANY RESIDENT (FOREIGNER OR NATIONAL) OF SOMALIA. </p><p>THE EXCHANGE RATE IN THIS MARKET FLOATS, WITH THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK SETTING A DAILY RATE </p><p>FOR ITS OWN TRANSACTIONS AT THE AVERAGE OF THE </p><p>PREVIOUS DAY\'S MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  STARTING AT </p><p>75:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS), THIS BANK RATE HAS </p><p>MOVED TO 82 IN THE THREE WEEKS SINCE THIS NEW </p><p>MARKET WAS ESTABLISHED ON JANUARY 2, 1985, AND WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY APPROACH THE REAL CURRENT PARALLEL MARKET </p><p>RATE OF 93 TO 95:1. </p><p>- </p><p>15. EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN SOMALIA INCLUDE DIRECT </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON REMITTANCES OF PROFITS, EARNINGS </p><p>AND CAPITAL, AND A LICENSING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL </p><p>CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  UNDER SOMALIA\'S CURRENT </p><p>INVESTMENT LAW, REGISTERED INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE </p><p>DEEMED "PRODUCTIVE" ARE ENTITLED TO REMIT ANNUALLY </p><p>EARNINGS EQUIVALENT TO 30 PERCENT OF INVESTED </p><p>CAPITAL; "NON-PRODUCTIVE" INVESTMENTS ARE PERMITTED </p><p>NO REMITTANCES FOR THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS, AND </p><p>REMITTANCES ANNUALLY EQUIVALENT TO ONLY 10 PERCENT </p><p>OF INVESTED CAPITAL.  WAGE EARNINGS OF FOREIGN </p><p>WORKERS, SIMILARLY, ARE RESTRICTED TO 50 PERCENT </p><p>OF ANNUAL INCOME.  ALL OF THESE RESTRICTIONS </p><p>REMAIN IN EFFECT UNDER SOMALIA\'S NEW DUAL FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE MARKET SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ACCOUNT </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS AT THE COMMERCIAL BANK, THESE RESTRIC- </p><p>TIONS EFFECTIVELY APPLY ONLY TO THOSE FUNDS WHICH </p><p>ORIGINALLY ARRIVED IN COUNTRY AS EXPORT PROCEEDS. </p><p>- </p><p>16. GOVERNMENT BUDGET OPERATIONS:  CENTRAL GOVERN- </p><p>MENT OPERATIONS HAVE ABSORBED A HIGH AND INCREASING </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF GDP IN SOMALIA.  BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ABSORBED AN AVERAGE </p><p>OF 22.6 PERCENT OF GDP ANNUALLY, A PERCENTAGE WHICH </p><p>ROSE TO 26.3 PERCENT BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  REVENUES, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAVE NOT KEPT PACE, AVERAGING 15.3 PERCENT </p><p>OF GDP IN BOTH PERIODS.  DEFICITS IN BOTH PERIODS </p><p>WERE FINANCED PRIMARILY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS. </p><p>IN THE EARLIER PERIOD, HOWEVER, THIS FOREIGN </p><p>FINANCING WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY SIZEABLE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM CREDITS, A REQUIREMENT THAT WAS ELIMINATED </p><p>BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983 BEFORE REAPPEARING IN 1984. </p><p>- </p><p>17. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET OPERATIONS (AS A </p><p>-   PERCENT OF GDP) </p><p> </p><p>-                                1972-80     1981-83 </p><p> </p><p>EXPENDITURES                       22.6        26.3 </p><p>REVENUE                            15.3        15.3 </p><p>DEFICIT                             7.3        11.0 </p><p> </p><p>18.

TAXATION:  SOMALIA RAISES THE VAST MAJORITY </p><p>OF ITS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE FROM TAXES ON </p><p>TRADE AND TRANSACTIONS.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY </p><p>GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES, TAXES ON INCOME AND PROFIT </p><p>IN 1983 ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 4 PERCENT OF TOTAL </p><p>REVENUE; PROPERTY TAXES CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENT; WHILE </p><p>LEVIES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES AND DEPARTMENTAL </p><p>SURPLUSES ACCOUNTED FOR 17 PERCENT.  THE BALANCE </p><p>WAS COVERED BY TAXES ON IMPORTS (51 PERCENT OF TOTAL </p><p>REVENUE), EXPORTS (3 PERCENT), EXCISE TAXES (12 </p><p>PERCENT) AND STAMP TAXES (6.8 PERCENT).  RATES </p><p>VARIED BY SOURCE.  ON PERSONAL INCOME EARNED FROM </p><p>EMPLOYMENT, TAX RATES RANGED FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS </p><p>LESS THAN US DOLS 6  PER MONTH TO 18.9 PERCENT FOR </p><p>EARNINGS ABOVE US DOLS 42 PER MONTH.  FOR OTHER </p><p>PERSONAL INCOME, RATES RANGE FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS </p><p>LESS THAN US DOLS 67 PER YEAR TO 30 PERCENT FOR EARN- </p><p>INGS ABOVE US DOLS 835 PER YEAR.  PRIVATE CORPORATE </p><p>PROFITS ARE TAXED AT A FLAT 35 PERCENT RATE. </p><p>SPECIFIC EXCISE TAXES ARE LEVIED ON SUGAR, TOBACCO, </p><p>MATCHES, BEVERAGES, MINERAL WATER, SOAP AND SHAMPOO; </p><p>A GENERAL 5 PERCENT SALES TAX HAS ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED </p><p>WHICH WILL APPLY TO ALL BUT ESSENTIAL GOODS. </p><p>CUSTOMS DUTIES AVERAGE 60-65 PERCENT OF THE VALUE OF </p><p>DUTIABLE MERCHANDISE AND ARE APPLIED AT RATES THAT </p><p>RANGE FROM ZERO TO OVER 100 PERCENT ON 120 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE L/C VALUE OF IMPORTED COMMODITIES VALUED </p><p>AT AN ADMINISTRATIVE RATE OF 60:1 (SHILLINGS TO </p><p>DOLLARS).  EXPORT TAXES ARE APPLIED ON ALL MAJOR </p><p>EXPORTS AT RATES RANGING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF FOB </p><p>VALUE.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND STATISTICAL TAXES ARE </p><p>ALSO APPLIED AT A 10 PERCENT AD VALOREM RATE TO ALL </p><p>IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.  TAXES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES </p><p>INCLUDE A TURNOVER TAX (APPLIED AT A RATE OF 50 </p><p>PERCENT ON NET PROFIT), A PROFIT TAX (APPLIED AT A </p><p>35 PERCENT RATE AFTER DEDUCTION OF THE TURNOVER TAX) </p><p>AND A 50 PERCENT GOVERNMENT SHARE IN ANNUAL DEPRECIA- </p><p>TION ALLOWANCES. </p><p>- </p><p>20. PRICING POLICIES:  CONSUMER PRICES:  SOMALIA </p><p>OFFICIALLY ENDED ALL CONSUMER PRICE CONTROLS IN </p><p>JANUARY 1985.  OIL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE IMPORTED BY </p><p>A GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY OPERATING AT THE OFFICIAL </p><p>(36:1) EXCHANGE RATE, ARE STILL AVAILABLE AT WHAT </p><p>AMOUNTS TO SUBSIDIZED PRICES (E.G., 17 SHILLINGS PER </p><p>LITER OF GASOLINE).  ALL OTHER PRICES, HOWEVER, </p><p>INCLUDING PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER, HAVE </p><p>BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT FULL COSTS AT THE PARALLEL </p><p>MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE. </p><p>- </p><p>21. PRODUCER PRICES:  AGRICULTURAL MARKETS AND PRICES </p><p>WERE LARGELY DECONTROLLED BY SOMALIA IN JANUARY 1984, </p><p>AND, IN THE YEAR SINCE, BASIC FOOD PRICES HAVE RISEN </p><p>TO MARKET RATES.  THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>CORPORATION, THE GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY WHICH </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HELD A MONOPSONY ON ALL GRAIN PURCHASES </p><p>IN SOMALIA, STILL HOLDS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO PURCHASE </p><p>UP TO 5 PERCENT OF EACH YEAR\'S CROP, BUT HAS NOT </p><p>EXERCISED THAT RIGHT IN RECENT YEARS.  BANANA EXPORTS </p><p>FROM SOMALIA ARE ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF A </p><p>PRIVATE/PUBLIC JOINT VENTURE, WHICH, OBLIGED IN THE </p><p>PAST TO OPERATE AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, HAS </p><p>NOT ALWAYS OFFERED COMPETITIVE PRICES FOR EXPORT </p><p>QUALITY FRUIT.  NOW FREE TO OPERATE AT THE PARALLEL </p><p>MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER </p><p>COMPETITIVE PRICES IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>- </p><p>22. STATE ENTERPRISE PRICES:  THE PRICE DECONTROL </p><p>INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 1985 HAS LEFT ALL PUBLIC </p><p>ENTERPRISES WITH FULL FREEDOM TO SET INPUT AND </p><p>OUTPUT PRICES AT LEVELS THAT WILL FULLY COVER </p><p>COSTS.  MANY, HOWEVER, ENJOY MONOPOLY POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE ECONOMY, AND HAVE NOT BEEN FORCED BY COMPETITIVE </p><p>PRESSURES OR PRICE DEVELOPMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE </p><p>ECONOMY TO MOVE THEIR PRICES TO ECONOMIC LEVELS.  IN </p><p>THIS CLASS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MONOPOLIES ARE THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK; THE STATE INSURANCE </p><p>COMPANY OF SOMALIA; THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM AGENCY, </p><p>WHICH CONTROLS OIL IMPORTS; THE SOMALI COOPERATIVE </p><p>MOVEMENT,WHICH CONTROLS IN-COUNTRY OIL DISTRIBUTION </p><p>AND, THROUGH THE FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH AGENCY, EX- </p><p>PORTS OF AROMATIC GUMS; THE SOMALI LEATHER AGENCY, </p><p>WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF HIDES AND SKINS, ASPIMA, </p><p>WHICH CONTROLS IMPORTS OF VETERINARY DRUGS; </p><p>SOMALFRUTTA, WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF BANANAS; </p><p>THE SOMALI SHIPPING AGENCY, AND THE SOMALI CLEARING </p><p>AND FORWARDING AGENCIES. </p><p>- </p><p>23. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT POLICIES:  THE PUBLIC </p><p>ENTERPRISES:  THERE ARE NOW 51 PARASTATAL CORPORATIONS </p><p>OPERATING IN SOMALIA, INCLUDING FIVE FINANCIAL, 33 </p><p>NON-FINANCIAL AND EIGHT NON-COMMERCIAL PUBLIC ENTER- </p><p>PRISES, WHICH TOGETHER DOMINATE MOST BANKING, </p><p>INSURANCE, AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN SOMALIA. </p><p>DURING THE 1970\'S THESE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT TREATED </p><p>PRIMARILY AS PROFIT-MAKING COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, </p><p>BUT OFTEN AS SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL </p><p>WELFARE POLICIES.  SURPLUSES WERE TAXED AWAY BY HIGH </p><p>PROFIT TAXES AND GOVERNMENT CLAIMS ON DEPRECIATION </p><p>ALLOWANCES; WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT WERE DISTORTED BY </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AND PRICES FOR BOTH INPUTS </p><p>AND OUTPUTS MAINTAINED AT UNREALISTICALLY LOW LEVELS. </p><p>BEGINNING IN 1981, SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.  THREE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES </p><p>HAVE BEEN CLOSED; OTHERS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH </p><p>FOREIGN MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE.  THE REST ARE BEING </p><p>REVIEWED TO DETERMINE WHICH TO RETAIN AS SERVICE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES, WHICH TO DIVEST </p><p>OR CLOSE, AND WHICH TO ESTABLISH AS COMMERCIAL </p><p>ENTERPRISES IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS.  DECISIONS HAVE </p><p>ALSO BEEN TAKEN TO GRANT ALL PUBLIC ENTERPRISES </p><p>AUTONOMY IN REGARD TO WAGE, EMPLOYMENT AND PRICING </p><p>DECISIONS, AND WHERE POSSIBLE, TO ELIMINATE THE </p><p>REMAINING PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES IN TRADE, BANKING </p><p>AND SERVICES.  PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THESE DECISIONS, </p><p>HOWEVER HAS BEEN SLOW. </p><p>- </p><p>24. PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  INCENTIVES:  SOMALIA\'S </p><p>CURRENT INVESTMENT LAW OFFERS NEW INVESTMENTS TAX </p><p>HOLIDAYS ON ALL INCOME, IMPORT, EXCISE AND PROPERTY </p><p>TAXES FOR PERIODS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS.  IT ALSO </p><p>GUARANTEES REMITTANCES AT THE RATES OUTLINED ABOVE. </p><p>IN ADDITION, J  FHE NEW FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS, FACILITIES FOR REMITTANCES ABOVE THE </p><p>RATES DEFINED IN THE LAW ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEW </p><p>LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET.  SOMALIA HAS NEGOTIATED A </p><p>BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC </p><p>OF GERMANY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR MOST FAVORED NATION </p><p>OR NATIONAL TREATMENT FOR GERMAN INVESTORS, PROMPT </p><p>AND ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IN CASE OF EXPROPRIATION, </p><p>AND FREE TRANSFER OF CAPITAL, DIVIDENDS, INTEREST </p><p>AND EARNINGS.  IT ALSO HAS UNDER CONSIDERATION TWO </p><p>DRAFT BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN. </p><p>- </p><p>25. DISINCENTIVES:  DISINCENTIVES TO PRIVATE INVEST- </p><p>MENT INCLUDE THE COUNTRY\'S GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURAL AND </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES, THE CONTINUING THREAT OF </p><p>POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, THE PRE-EMPTION </p><p>OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE </p><p>MONOPOLIES, A CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY REGARDING </p><p>MARKET FREEDOMS, THE CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS ON </p><p>WAGE AND CAPITAL REMITTANCES, THE LACK OF A WELL </p><p>DEFINED BODY OF COMPANY AND COMMERCIAL LAW, AND AN </p><p>ONEROUS (THOUGH UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WHICH OFFICIALLY </p><p>DEPRIVES THE EMPLOYER OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE </p><p>FREELY, MANDATES AN UNECONOMICALLY HIGH LEVEL OF WORKER </p><p>BENEFITS, AND RESTRICTS THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN </p><p>NATIONALS.  A REVIEW OF INVESTMENT LAW NOW UNDER WAY </p><p>MAY ELIMINATE SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS NOW IMPOSED </p><p>ON REMITTANCES, AND PROVIDE A FULLER SET OF PROPERTY </p><p>RIGHTS FOR NEW INVESTORS. </p><p>- </p><p>26. LEVELS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS, AS </p><p>WEATHER INDUCED FLUCTUATIONS IN INVENTORY ACCUMULATION </p><p>IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT LIVESTOCK SECTOR OVERWHELMED </p><p>RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF PRIVATE SECTOR FIXED CAPITAL </p><p>FORMATION.  PUBLIC SECTOR SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT HAVE </p><p>ALSO VARIED WIDELY AS WARS, DROUGHTS AND REFUGEE </p><p>CRISES HAVE REPEATEDLY SWELLED RECURRENT EXPENDITURES. </p><p>OVERALL, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT TOTALLED APPROXIMATELY </p><p>18 PERCENT OF GDP (10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 8 PERCENT PRIVATE) </p><p>BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, RISING TO 21 PERCENT (10 PERCENT </p><p>PUBLIC, 11 PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983. </p><p>SAVINGS LAGGED, TOTALLING ONLY 3 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS </p><p>7 PERCENT PUBLIC, 10 PERCENT PRIVATE) IN 1972 TO 1980, </p><p>AND 4 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS 10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 14 </p><p>PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  THE BALANCE </p><p>OF INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES WERE COVERED BY FOREIGN </p><p>GRANTS AND LOANS, AND REMITTANCES, WHICH TOGETHER </p><p>AVERAGED 15 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, </p><p>AND 18 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  FOR 1984 </p><p>TO 1986, SOMALIA HAS PROPOSED A PUBLIC INVESTMENT </p><p>PROGRAM WHICH WOULD RAISE NATIONAL INVESTMENT TO 23 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP (16 PERCENT PUBLIC AND 7 PERCENT </p><p>PRIVATE) FINANCED ENTIRELY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS </p><p>(25.5 PERCENT OF GDP).  WITH FOREIGN FINANCING AND </p><p>THE PUBLIC SECTOR\'S OWN ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY SETTING </p><p>LIMITS TO PUBLIC SECTOR ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, ACTUAL </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT TOTALLED ONLY ABOUT 9 PERCENT </p><p>OF GDP IN 1984 - A RATE THAT LIKELY WILL HOLD FOR THE </p><p>NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>27. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT (AS SHARES OF GDP): </p><p> </p><p>-                                1972-80     1981-83 </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT                         18.4        21.1 </p><p> </p><p>-   PUBLIC                         10.0        10.1 </p><p>-   PRIVATE                         8.4        11.0 </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC SAVINGS                    3.0         3.6 </p><p> </p><p>-   PUBLIC                       -  7.2      - 10.2 </p><p>-   PRIVATE                        10.2        13.8 </p><p> </p><p>REMITTANCES                         1.6         1.8 </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS           13.8        15.7 </p><p>- </p><p>28. AID ASSISTANCE:  DISBURSEMENTS OF GRANTS AND </p><p>LOANS TO SOMALIA FROM ALL OFFICIAL SOURCES FOR </p><p>ALL USES (REFUGEE, DEVELOPMENT AND BALANCE OF </p><p>PAYMENTS ASSISTANCE) HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY OVER </p><p>THE PAST NINE YEARS, RISING FROM SLIGHTLY OVER </p><p>US DOLS 120 MILLION IN 1975 TO APPROXIMATELY US </p><p>DOLS 300 MILLION IN 1983, BEFORE DROPPING OFF </p><p>SLIGHTLY IN 1984 TO APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 260 </p><p>MILLION.  GRANTS ACCOUNTED FOR A GRADUALLY IN- </p><p>CREASING PROPORTION OF THIS ASSISTANCE (ABOVE 50 </p><p>PERCENT IN 1984), AND LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS </p><p>FROM THE IMF AND ARAB MONETARY FUND, FOR THE </p><p>BALANCE.  MAJOR DONORS AND LENDERS INCLUDED SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, KUWAIT, THE UNITED STATES, ITALY, THE </p><p>FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, THE EEC, THE IBRD, </p><p>THE IMF, THE ARAB FUND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK.  FOR 1985 AND 1986, </p><p>SOMALIA HAS PROJECTED FURTHER GRANT AND LOAN DIS- </p><p>BURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 900 MILLION, </p><p>THOUGH ACTUAL DISBURSEMENTS MAY FALL SOMEWHAT </p><p>SHORT OF THIS TARGET. </p><p>- </p><p>29. PARALLELING THE RAPID INCREASE IN AID DIS- </p><p>BURSEMENTS HAS BEEN AN EQUALLY RAPID RISE IN SOMALIA\'S </p><p>EXTERNAL DEBT.  BETWEEN YEAR END 1979 AND YEAR END </p><p>1984, SOMALIA\'S TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT ROSE TO APPROX- </p><p>IMATELY US DOLS 1445 MILLION, UP US DOLS 848 MILLION </p><p>FROM THE US DOLS 597 MILLION LEVEL WHICH HAD PRE- </p><p>VAILED AT THE CLOSE OF 1979.  THANKS TO EXTENSIVE </p><p>REFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, (WITH MIDDLE EASTERN </p><p>CREDITORS, IN PARTICULAR), OVERALL DEBT SERVICE </p><p>PAYMENTS HAVE REMAINED MANAGEABLE (50 PERCENT OF </p><p>GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS IN 1984).  WITHOUT </p><p>FURTHER RESCHEDULINGS, HOWEVER, DEBT SERVICE PAY- </p><p>MENTS WILL RISE TO, AND MAY EXCEED, THE TOTAL OF </p><p>SOMALIA\'S GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS OVER THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS. </p><p>- </p><p>30. SOURCES:  THE PRIMARY SOURCES USED IN COMPILING </p><p>THIS REPORT WERE THE WORLD BANK\'S PRELIMINARY </p><p>ESTIMATES OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT AGGREGATES PUBLISHED </p><p>IN AUGUST 1984, THE IMF\'S REVIEW OF SOMALIA\'S STAND- </p><p>BY ARRANGEMENT PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1984, THE IMF\'S </p><p>DRAFT FINANCIAL PROGRAM FOR SOMALIA\'S PROPOSED </p><p>1985 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1984, AND THE IMF\'S GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL </p><p>STATISTICS YEARBOOK FOR 1983, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>STATISTICS YEARBOOK FOR 1984, AND REPORT ON EX- </p><p>CHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS FOR </p><p>1984.
