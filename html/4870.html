<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 002484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/NEA </p><p>STATE ALSO PLEASE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>USAID FOR ANE/AA GORDON WEST AND JIM BEVER </p><p>MANILA FOR USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL/DAUFHAUSER AND DAS JZARATE </p><p>TREASURY ALSO FOR OFAC/RNEWCOMB AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PTER, CASC, PGOV, NP, IN, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  UPDATE ON MAOIST ACTIVITIES, DEC 21-DEC 27 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.   The Centre For Economic and Social Development released </p><p>a study on December 24 that showed an overwhelming majority </p><p>of Nepalis, particularly those in Maoist infested areas, </p><p>support a multi-party democracy.  The local press reported </p><p>that India has tightened security along its northern borders </p><p>following reports of Maoists entering the area, while the </p><p>Indian Ambassador claimed to the press that two Indian </p><p>terrorist groups have been crossing the border to train in </p><p>camps located in Nepal.  Amnesty International has accused </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) of intimidating two victims into </p><p>recanting their allegations of rape by top army officials. </p><p>The RNA is facing increasing pressure from the media and </p><p>human rights organizations for alleged human rights abuses. </p><p>Skepticism surrounds the proposed peace talks between the </p><p>government and Maoists as both sides demand formal peace </p><p>proposals.  Maoist violence continued, with the killings of </p><p>three policemen, a soldier, and a schoolteacher, and a </p><p>December 26 bomb blast in downtown Kathmandu.  The </p><p>insurgents also abducted, but later released, unharmed, 45 </p><p>schoolchildren; kidnapped a local development officer; </p><p>destroyed a police post; and increased extortion demands. </p><p>Besides a one-day general strike in the western region that </p><p>disrupted business, education and transportation, the </p><p>Maoists have also called a strike December 29-30 in the </p><p>Narayani and Bagmati zones, which includes the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley.  Another bandh has been declared for January 3 in </p><p>the southeastern city of Biratnagar to disrupt a visit to </p><p>that area by the King. </p><p> </p><p>NEPALIS FAVOR MULTI-PARTY DEMOCRACY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  A survey conducted by the Centre For Economic and Social </p><p>Development (CESOD), a Kathmandu based non-governmental </p><p>organization, released December 24, shows that over 73 </p><p>percent of Nepalis support a multi-party democracy.  CESOD </p><p>conducted its research over a six-month period, in the </p><p>districts of Surkhet, Bardia, Sindhuli, Rautahat, Morang, </p><p>and Dhankuta, all of which are infested with Maoists.  The </p><p>report also stated that villagers favor a democracy that is </p><p>free from corruption and want the current political crisis </p><p>to be solved through dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>INDIA PUTS PARAMILITARY FORCES ALONG BORDER </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. According to the local press, India has placed </p><p>paramilitary forces along its borders, following reports </p><p>that Maoist rebels were crossing into Northern India.  Shyam </p><p>Saran, India\'s Ambassador to Nepal, publicly denied that </p><p>India harbors Nepali Maoists, instead blaming the open </p><p>border.  Saran also said that members of two Indian </p><p>terrorist groups, the Maoist Coordination Committee (MCC) </p><p>and the Peoples War Group (PWG) cross the border into Nepal </p><p>to enter training camps.  Saran asserted that India will not </p><p>take part in any joint military action with Nepal against </p><p>the Maoists, nor play any role in mediating talks between </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>RNA UNDER FIRE, HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Following publication of its December 19 report on </p><p>Nepal, Amnesty International (AI) accused the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) of pressuring two victims highlighted in the </p><p>report to recant their allegations of rape against army </p><p>officials.  The AI statement called upon the GON to ensure </p><p>the protection and safety of all victims of human rights </p><p>abuses.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has </p><p>issued a statement castigating the GON for failing to </p><p>acknowledge the AI report and demanding that the GON </p><p>investigate human rights abuses and punish violators </p><p>accordingly.  NHRC announced that it will send teams of </p><p>observers to the western districts of Banke and Baridya to </p><p>monitor the situations there.  Meanwhile, the Non Government </p><p>Federation and the Association of International NGOs have </p><p>joined in expressing their "grave concern" over  human </p><p>rights abuses by both the Maoists and the government, citing </p><p>the escalation of rape, torture, kidnappings and </p><p>disappearances of civilians.  The Human Rights and Peace </p><p>Society denounced the November 27 killings by the RNA of </p><p>five young men and boys in Nuwakot as a human rights </p><p>violation. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Under increasing pressure from the media and human </p><p>rights organizations, the RNA held a press conference </p><p>December 26 to defend its human rights record and give its </p><p>version of two well publicized cases, the killing of five </p><p>youths in the Nuwakot district as well as the allegations of </p><p>rape by top Army officials. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) issued a statement denying </p><p>the accusations of rape.  Gurung said the reports of rape </p><p>were baseless and denied that the victims were forced to </p><p>recant their stories.  He showed video footage of the two </p><p>women involved and claimed that they appeared relaxed and </p><p>not under any pressure to recant their stories.  Preliminary </p><p>results of the RNA investigation into the Nuwakot killings </p><p>indicate that the five youths may have been innocent, Gurung </p><p>acknowledged.  Should the final investigation support those </p><p>initial findings, appropriate action against the soldiers </p><p>involved will be taken, he pledged. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DECLARE BANDHS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Maoists have declared a two-day general strike (bandh) </p><p>for December 29 and 30 in the Bagmati and Narayani zones, to </p><p>include the Kathmandu Valley.  Taxi and bus services will be </p><p>shut down, and businesses and schools closed.  In the past, </p><p>vehicles that break the strike have been attacked.  The </p><p>Maoists have also declared a bandh in southeastern Nepal, to </p><p>include the Biratnagar area, on January 3, which coincides </p><p>with a visit by the King to that region. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists called a one-day bandh on December 25 in the </p><p>western region that affected businesses, schools and </p><p>transportation.  Districts affected by the bandh included </p><p>Baglung, Rupandehi, and Nawalparasi. Major businesses, </p><p>schools and industries closed, and highways were empty. </p><p> </p><p>PM CHAND WANTS FORMAL PROPOSAL FROM MAOISTS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand told the press he </p><p>is still awaiting a formal peace proposal from the Maoists </p><p>in order to move ahead with peace talks.  Chand said the GON </p><p>would take a "positive stance" if the Maoists made an </p><p>"authoritative and credible" offer of a peace proposal. </p><p>Devi Prasad Ojha, Minister for Education and Sports, </p><p>however, told the press that he expected the talks to be </p><p>held by the second week of February, but refused to </p><p>elaborate. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS SET CONDITIONS FOR TALKS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Maoists, in turn, have demanded that the government </p><p>announce a formal peace offer before beginning dialogue. </p><p>Maoist leader Prachanda issued a statement demanding that </p><p>the GON comply with four conditions before dialogue can take </p><p>place: that the terrorist designation by the government be </p><p>lifted; that it stop killing innocent people; that it </p><p>disclose the location of detainees; and that it provide a </p><p>clear agenda of the issues that need to be discussed. </p><p>According to Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for Physical </p><p>Planning and Works, the GON is considering whether to lift </p><p>the terrorist designation, but will not reach a decision </p><p>until it has consulted with all major political parties. </p><p>Party leaders quoted in the local press expressed skepticism </p><p>regarding the Maoists\' sincerity in pushing for talks. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS TRY NEW STRATEGY IN GORKHA </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  In the historic western district of Gorkha, Maoists are </p><p>trying to garner support from the villagers, according to </p><p>local press reports.  The Maoists reportedly have changed </p><p>their tactics from using violence to handing out food and </p><p>treats to the villagers.  At the same time, however, the </p><p>Maoists have warned that those who spy against them will be </p><p>killed.  Villagers, some willingly and some out of fear, </p><p>provide food and shelter to the insurgents, making it more </p><p>difficult for the security forces to take action against </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>AMID PEACE TALKS, MAOIST VIOLENCE CONTINUES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  A bomb exploded in downtown Kathmandu on December 26, </p><p>injuring seven people and damaging two buildings.  On </p><p>December 20, a group of Maoists brutally killed a </p><p>schoolteacher in central Kavre district, dragging him from </p><p>his bed, stabbing him with khukuris and iron rods, and </p><p>pouring acid in his wounds.  On December 21, Maoist rebels </p><p>kidnapped a local development officer in the Ridibazar </p><p>district.  On December 22, Maoists also abducted 45 students </p><p>from a secondary school in the Surkhet district.  The </p><p>students reportedly were released unharmed. </p><p> </p><p>13. On December 23, a group of Maoists bombed the Mahuwari </p><p>Police Post in Rupandehi district, completely destroying the </p><p>post and all of the documents inside.  Maoists shot and </p><p>killed a National Intelligence Department (NID) inspector at </p><p>his home in the Kathmandu Valley on December 24.  Another </p><p>officer was killed in Kapilvastu district on December 25 </p><p>when Maoist rebels opened fire on him as he was conducting </p><p>checks on a passenger bus.  On that same day, another </p><p>officer was killed in Tikapur, when he was called from his </p><p>house by two Maoists, who then shot him.  Two other </p><p>policemen in the Syangja district were injured when a </p><p>landmine was detonated by Maoists.  On December 22, Maoist </p><p>rebels set a Chief District Officer\'s house on fire after </p><p>forcing the family members to vacate it.  In another </p><p>incident, a Royal Nepalese Army soldier was killed on </p><p>December 22 in an ambush by Maoists in the eastern district </p><p>of Panchthaar. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists have ordered residents in the district of </p><p>Surkhet to leave by early January, hinting at an attack on </p><p>the district headquarters.  Villagers have been asked to </p><p>vacate their houses and shops. </p><p> </p><p>PLEA TO MAOISTS TO STOP KILLING JOURNALISTS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Members of Reporters Without Borders (RSF) issued a </p><p>plea to Maoists to stop killing members of the media after </p><p>the kidnap and murder of a journalist who had been working </p><p>for a pro-Maoist newspaper before surrendering to the </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS EXTORT MORE MONEY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  Maoists have launched a massive "household tax" </p><p>campaign, demanding money from households in the western and </p><p>southern parts of northern Bhojpur district.  The insurgents </p><p>reportedly assess the tax on a sliding scale,  according to </p><p>the financial status of the families.   Maoists have also </p><p>intensified their collection of money from professionals in </p><p>the Parbat and Ramechhap districts, demanding donations from </p><p>teachers, government employees, and merchants. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Maoists have issued a 35-day ultimatum for all non- </p><p>government organizations, including educational </p><p>institutions, in the far-western district of Doti to </p><p>register with them or face shutdowns.  The Maoists have </p><p>warned that those organizations who fail to register with </p><p>the "people\'s government" will be forcibly closed. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
