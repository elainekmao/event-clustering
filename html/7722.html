<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PMAT, INL, EB, NEA, AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, EAID, KCRM, KJUS, IZ, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION: CANADA OFFERS AIR TRANSPORT, </p><p>DART ENGINEERS AND CIVILIAN POLICE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 1161 AND PREVIOUS (B) STATE 98807 (C) </p><p> </p><p>     STATE 102473 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canadian Prime Minister Chretien issued an Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction press release on April 29, announcing that </p><p>Canada is ready to make available elements of its Disaster </p><p>Assistance Response Team (DART); Canadian transport aircraft </p><p>to support humanitarian assistance efforts and reconstruction </p><p>material movement; and police, corrections and legal </p><p>assistance.  The transport aircraft would be drawn from three </p><p>CC130 Hercules aircraft already deployed in theater as part </p><p>of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Chretien also discussed these </p><p>offers during a press conference following a Cabinet meeting </p><p>later in the day.  Alex Himelfarb, Clerk of the Privy </p><p>Council, told DCM that Chretien decided over the weekend not </p><p>to wait for the April 29 Cabinet meeting to respond to our </p><p>requests, and that his decision was unequivocal. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Just prior to the press release, Jill Sinclair, </p><p>Foreign Affairs Director General for International Security, </p><p>informed DCM of the Canadian decision on military assistance, </p><p>and presented him with a paper on "Canadian Support for </p><p>Reconstruction in Iraq" (faxed to WHA/CAN).  In addition to </p><p>the military and police contributions, the paper notes that </p><p>the GoC is considering contributions to the rehabilitation of </p><p>health, water and sanitation systems of Iraq, and increasing </p><p>its US$3.5 million contribution to the UN Mine Action Service </p><p>for Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The GoC paper welcomes the "early efforts on the part </p><p>of the occupying powers to work with Iraqis to establish an </p><p>interim authority," and calls for the international community </p><p>to play in important role.  On the UN, the paper notes </p><p>Canada\'s support for UNSC resolutions which would facilitate </p><p>the flow of donor assistance, provide legitimacy to an Iraqi </p><p>interim authority, and provide a multilateral framework for </p><p>"ongoing reconstruction assistance."  Sinclair reiterated, </p><p>however, that Canada will take a pragmatic approach to </p><p>reconstruction assistance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Sinclair said that while the GoC has already taken the </p><p>decision on its military offer for post-conflict Iraq, the </p><p>Cabinet still needs to make a final decision on the levels </p><p>and sources of funding for civil assistance.  She expected </p><p>final decisions to be taken at the May 6 Cabinet meeting. </p><p>Sinclair reiterated strong GoC interest in participating in </p><p>the "justice sector" assessment team visit to Iraq beginning </p><p>May 8.  She noted that the Canadian Government requires a </p><p>site visit before deployment of Canadian police teams abroad, </p><p>and that it would greatly expedite getting Canadian police on </p><p>the ground if Canada could be there with the U.S. and other </p><p>national representatives.  Canada would propose to send two </p><p>RCMP officers for the assessment visit, one with a </p><p>corrections background and the other with a justice </p><p>background. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: The PMO\'s message was more positive and </p><p>straightforward than the message we received from Foreign </p><p>Affairs, and more in line with what we had been expecting. </p><p>Canada is offering the types of support we had expected for </p><p>post-conflict Iraq, plus a bit more with the DART engineers. </p><p>Canada will now want to hear from us, as soon as possible, on </p><p>how to best incorporate these offers with what we and other </p><p>coalition partners are doing.  In the first instance, we </p><p>strongly encourage a positive response to the Canadian </p><p>request to be included on the police assessment team visit to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
