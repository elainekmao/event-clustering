(SBU) Summary: This cable reports findings of </p><p>joint visit by REDSO/FFP and OFDA/ARO reps to </p><p>Zimbabwe to review humanitarian crisis, including </p><p>participation in FAO/WFP crop and food supply </p><p>crisis will be much worse due to the minimal </p><p>carryover stocks, the continuing impact of poor </p><p>economic policy management and the so-called "fast- </p><p>track" land reform program.  Of particular concern </p><p>is the impact of continuing prohibitions of </p><p>private sector imports and foreign exchange </p><p>controls.  A combination of urgent economic policy </p><p>reforms and humanitarian assistance is needed now </p><p>to avert the advent of a large scale famine that </p><p>would have grave social and economic impacts on </p><p>Zimbabwe and the region.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Overview of situation:  Historically a </p><p>breadbasket for the Southern African region, </p><p>Zimbabwe is now in need of massive food imports </p><p>and humanitarian assistance.  This staggering </p><p>reversal has been brought on by a combination of </p><p>commercial farm invasions in the guise of land </p><p>reform, poor economic policy management, and </p><p>drought.  Production on commercial farms has </p><p>fallen dramatically, and many communal farming </p><p>areas, particularly in the South and East, have </p><p>experienced near total crop failure.  The hunger </p><p>season, which would normally end with the maize </p><p>harvest in April/May, has instead been extended </p><p>and deepened.  There is a lack of maize available </p><p>for sale in local markets, and even individuals </p><p>with funds are finding it increasingly difficult </p><p>to obtain food.  While the climatic severity of </p><p>this year\'s drought may be less than that of 1992, </p><p>the food security crisis will be much worse due to </p><p>the minimal carryover stocks, the continuing </p><p>impact of poor economic policy management and the </p><p>so-called "fast-track" land reform program.  Of </p><p>particular concern is the combination of </p><p>continuing prohibitions on private sector imports </p><p>and GOZ foreign exchange controls.  A combination </p><p>of urgent economic policy reforms and humanitarian </p><p>assistance is needed now to avert the advent of a </p><p>large scale famine that would have grave social </p><p>and economic impacts on Zimbabwe and the region. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Crop and food supply assessment mission: </p><p>FAO and WFP led a multi-agency crop and food </p><p>supply assessment mission in Zimbabwe from April </p><p>23 to May 10.  On May 9, the assessment team </p><p>debriefed donor representatives on its preliminary </p><p>findings (assessment details were reported in </p><p>September).  A final written report of assessment </p><p>findings should be released by WFP/FAO before the </p><p>end of May.  REDSO/FFP rep participated in part of </p><p>the field portion of the mission, traveling to </p><p>Masvingo and Matabeleland South provinces. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Crop production estimates:  The </p><p>assessment mission concluded that maize production </p><p>levels are even less than the 600,000 mts </p><p>previously estimated, perhaps around 500,000 mts, </p><p>this compares to a normal year production of over </p><p>two million mts.  Annual domestic consumption </p><p>requirements are over 1.8 million mts, leaving a </p><p>maize import requirement of roughly 1.3 to 1.4 </p><p>million mts.  The assessment mission also forecast </p><p>that wheat production would fall to about one- </p><p>third of last year\'s harvest of about 330,000 mts. </p><p>The poor winter wheat crop is due to the dramatic </p><p>reduction of acreage planted on commercial farms, </p><p>and is a direct consequence of uncertainty created </p><p>by the GOZ\'s fast track land reform program and </p><p>commercial farm invasions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Effects of drought:  Poor rainfall has </p><p>affected most of the country, with the effects of </p><p>drought on crop production most pronounced in the </p><p>Southern and Western provinces of Masvingo and </p><p>Matabeleland (areas assessed by REDSO/FFP rep), </p><p>where a long dry spell in January/February (midway </p><p>through the growing season) led to widespread crop </p><p>failure.  Many households and communities observed </p><p>during the assessment mission had virtually no </p><p>harvest al all.  Most maize in these areas is </p><p>grown by communal farmers, with commercial farms </p><p>focused more on ranching.  Given the dry climate, </p><p>these areas are not self-sufficient in maize </p><p>production even in normal years, and most farm </p><p>households normally supplement crop production </p><p>with market purchases.  Livestock, remittances, </p><p>gold mining, and farm labor are among key income </p><p>sources.  The one bit of good news is that </p><p>livestock has not been seriously affected. </p><p>Pasture and water conditions are expected to be </p><p>adequate for the rest of the year, assuming normal </p><p>rains next season.  In this respect the drought is </p><p>less severe than the 1992 drought, which caused </p><p>heavy cattle losses. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Fate of commercial farm workers: </p><p>Commercial farm invasions have caused loss of </p><p>employment and displacement for many farm workers </p><p>and their families.  Over 2000 commercial farms </p><p>are reported to have been taken over to date, and </p><p>an additional 3,000 are slated for fast track </p><p>takeover by the end of August 2002.  In most </p><p>cases, farm workers on invaded commercial farms </p><p>have been chased off the land with little or no </p><p>notice, sometimes with only the personal </p><p>possessions they could carry, or were wearing. </p><p>While it is difficult to get a firm grip on the </p><p>numbers, a conservative estimate is 40-50 workers </p><p>per farm and 3-4 persons per farm worker family. </p><p>By this calculation, the numbers of dispossessed </p><p>and now internally displaced farm workers and </p><p>family members would be around 300,000 people. </p><p>This number is expected to rise dramatically over </p><p>the next several months when additional 3,000 </p><p>farms are slated for fast track takeover. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) As yet, displaced farm workers and their </p><p>families have not begun to congregate in makeshift </p><p>camps or descend masse to larger urban areas.  It </p><p>is believed that some have moved to neighboring </p><p>farms, that others are still on the invaded farms </p><p>themselves, and that still others have either </p><p>blended into communities, or moved in with </p><p>relatives in other urban and peri urban areas.  It </p><p>is anticipated that the problem of displaced </p><p>workers will be most serious in the area of </p><p>Mashonaland in the north, which accounts for an </p><p>estimated 80% of all commercial farm workers. </p><p>Assessing the gravity of the problem has been </p><p>complicated, since those seeking to analyze the </p><p>situation (e.g., the FAO/WFP assessment mission) </p><p>have been unable to visit affected areas due to </p><p>restrictions or intimidation by government and/or </p><p>so-called "war veterans".  To date, only limited </p><p>numbers of displaced farm workers have assembled </p><p>in group sites.  OFDA/FFP reps visited two of </p><p>these sites near Harare, where NGOs are providing </p><p>food, shelter and other assistance to </p><p>approximately 270 displaced workers and family </p><p>members.  As the number of farm invasions </p><p>continues to increase, it is likely that the </p><p>numbers arriving in such sites will rise </p><p>substantially. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Economic policy effects:  Have </p><p>compounded the problems caused by drought and the </p><p>invasion of commercial farms.  Economic policies </p><p>that have discouraged crop production and greatly </p><p>restricted the country\'s capacity to import maize. </p><p>Key among these policies are food price controls, </p><p>the monopoly of the GOZ\'s Grain Marketing Board </p><p>(GMB), and foreign exchange rate controls. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Market access to food:  In past years, </p><p>when crop performance was poor, rural households </p><p>could satisfy their food needs with purchases in </p><p>local markets - and, in particular sales from the </p><p>government\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB) where </p><p>maize was usually readily available and </p><p>affordable.  This is no longer the case in many </p><p>areas, since access to maize in local markets and </p><p>from the GMB is increasingly difficult.  In all </p><p>the areas visited, including the cities of Harare </p><p>and Bulawayo, maize is increasingly in short </p><p>supply, with a marked drop off in availability </p><p>since the election.  While the GMB\'s official </p><p>prices remain reasonable (despite a recent </p><p>increase), very little maize can actually be </p><p>bought at this price.  GMB\'s imports have been </p><p>inadequate for meeting demand, and much of their </p><p>supplies are going through traders or "insiders" </p><p>who are reselling at prices above the official </p><p>prices.  No surprisingly, it is alleged that </p><p>affiliation with the ruling party is a determining </p><p>factor in who gets direct access to GMB supplies. </p><p>Given the government policies prohibiting both the </p><p>import of and wholesaling of food by the private </p><p>sector, privileged traders with access to GMB </p><p>supplies can readily take advantage of the </p><p>situation to charge prices double, triple or more </p><p>than the official price.  At one rural GMB depot </p><p>(visited by REDSO/FFP rep), women had been queuing </p><p>for several days, waiting to purchase maize that </p><p>had not even arrived yet.  There was wheat </p><p>available at the depot, but it was twice as </p><p>expensive and thus unaffordable.  In other places, </p><p>many consumers have no access to maize from GMB </p><p>and must either rely on private traders or </p><p>substitute other food.  This scarcity of maize in </p><p>markets will only get worse as the year </p><p>progresses.  With a limited supply of foreign </p><p>exchange, the GOZ is expected to be able to </p><p>purchase only about a quarter of the cereal import </p><p>requirement, leaving a consumption gap of </p><p>approximately one million mts. </p><p>10.  (SBU) Health/nutrition concerns:  UNICEF, WHO </p><p>and related NGOs are reporting serious </p><p>deterioration of the health service network in </p><p>Zimbabwe, as well as the general health of people. </p><p>Many health workers have left the country or are </p><p>doing other jobs, and NGOs report that remaining </p><p>health post personnel are desperately in need of </p><p>training.  Health posts and clinics also lack </p><p>basic medicines.  In particular, cholera has been </p><p>reported, since accessing medicine for treatment </p><p>of cholera is difficult.  DFID and EU have </p><p>recently provided several million USD to WHO and </p><p>UNICEF for medicines.  In addition measles </p><p>vaccination coverage has fallen from 70-80% in </p><p>previous years to only 43% in 2001.  Problems of </p><p>inadequate health services are reportedly worse in </p><p>rural areas than in urban areas.  UNICEF and WHO </p><p>have been working with the GOZ Ministry of Health </p><p>to conduct health and household surveys in 24 of </p><p>59 districts, data from which should be available </p><p>soon.  However, OFDA rep expressed serious </p><p>concerns about the quality and reliability of the </p><p>survey work being done. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Food aid needs:  While food aid has </p><p>already helped to mitigate the food availability </p><p>problem in many areas, food aid alone will not be </p><p>able to meet this large consumption gap, nor </p><p>should it be expected to.  Availability of donor </p><p>resources, logistical constraints, and the limited </p><p>capacity of NGOs to effectively implement and </p><p>monitor large scale food aid distributions are all </p><p>factors that will limit the scale of the food aid </p><p>response.  To be effective, the food aid response </p><p>must be accompanied by reversal of GOZ policies </p><p>that have closed import and wholesale markets to </p><p>the private sector and severely restricted access </p><p>to foreign exchange.  It is essential that </p><p>commercial imports be dramatically increased so </p><p>that the bulk of consumers that have economic </p><p>means can obtain food in local markets and thereby </p><p>allow emergency food aid to be targeted only to </p><p>households that lack purchasing power. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Political manipulation of humanitarian </p><p>aid:  Donors are very concerned about the </p><p>potential (and actual) political manipulation of </p><p>food aid and other humanitarian assistance.  There </p><p>are reports of humanitarian aid being directed </p><p>only to pro-ZANU/PF supporters and to government </p><p>officials "attaching themselves" to food aid </p><p>deliveries in order to gain political support from </p><p>beneficiaries.  USG and other donors are therefore </p><p>emphasizing that close "external" monitoring </p><p>(i.e., monitors outside of the implementing </p><p>agencies themselves) is essential to ensure </p><p>effective targeting of resources and minimizing </p><p>political manipulation of donor aid. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) GMO maize acceptability:  As of the end </p><p>of May, the GOZ had not accepted the 10,000 mts of </p><p>U.S. yellow maize that has been allocated for </p><p>Zimbabwe from the regional shipment of 30,000 mts </p><p>of yellow maize (plus other commodities) that is </p><p>expected to dock in Dar Es Salaam around May 26. </p><p>(Note: This shipment has been rerouted to other </p><p>regional beneficiaries).  The GOZ\'s refusal is </p><p>based on concerns about the maize being </p><p>genetically modified (i.e., GMO).  It is unclear, </p><p>however exactly what the GOZ is concerned about, </p><p>since they have switched back and forth between </p><p>risks of contamination of local (hybrid) varieties </p><p>and risks to EU export markets (even though the EU </p><p>denies any prohibitions on GMO-fed beef). </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Cereal alternatives:  If the GOZ does </p><p>not agree to accept the maize allocated from the </p><p>regional stock, an immediate implication is that </p><p>the 10,000 mts of maize from the regional shipment </p><p>will have to be reallocated to other countries in </p><p>the region.  (See note above).  This will have a </p><p>major negative impact on the Zimbabwe food aid </p><p>pipeline at a time when distributions need to be </p><p>substantially increased.  An additional </p><p>implication is that it will be necessary to </p><p>identify an alternative cereal for future </p><p>shipments.  While GMO yellow maize meal (as </p><p>opposed to grain) is acceptable (and is already </p><p>being used) FFP/W has indicated that it will not </p><p>be able to supply meal in great enough quantities </p><p>to address the Zimbabwe crisis.  A second </p><p>alternative would be immediate milling of yellow </p><p>corn that is not certified GMO-free upon arrival, </p><p>at GOZ expense.  While traveling in the field, </p><p>REDSO/FFP rep queried many people about the </p><p>acceptability of sorghum.  While it is clearly not </p><p>the preferred option, it appears that sorghum </p><p>would be an acceptable alternative to maize grain </p><p>in Zimbabwe (it could also be used in some other </p><p>countries in the region).  The fact that sorghum </p><p>is less preferred could also have advantages for </p><p>targeting purposes. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Addressing urban food needs:  While </p><p>food aid activities are currently targeted only to </p><p>rural areas, the lack of maize in urban markets, </p><p>the resulting higher prices, and the general </p><p>decline and rising unemployment are causing </p><p>increasing food insecurity in urban areas. </p><p>However, distributing food aid in urban areas </p><p>through conventional distribution approaches would </p><p>be very difficult due to the large numbers </p><p>involved as well as the lack of NGO capacity. </p><p>Ideas are under discussion by WFP and donors on </p><p>how to channel food aid through the private sector </p><p>(e.g., subsidized sales).  However, a prerequisite </p><p>for any such approach is GOZ enactment of a number </p><p>of policy changes to liberalize markets (as </p><p>described above).  There is presently little sign </p><p>that GOZ will make such changes.  It is also not </p><p>clear at this point that allocating substantial </p><p>amounts of emergency food aid to this type of </p><p>urban intervention would be the most effective use </p><p>of this scarce resource, as needs in rural areas </p><p>are currently more acute than in urban areas, with </p><p>the possible exception of the so-called "informal </p><p>settlements" areas.  It is also unclear that </p><p>subsidized food aid sales would directly benefit </p><p>the most needy urban dwellers, who may have little </p><p>or no purchasing power.  This issue does require </p><p>further consideration, however, and in particular </p><p>more attention must be directed to informal </p><p>settlements, where urban poverty is greatest. </p><p>16.  (SBU) Future assessments and regional food </p><p>appeal:  This cable does not provide specific </p><p>numbers on food aid and non-food aid needs.  In </p><p>part this is because UN is not prepared at this </p><p>time to release specific numbers until completion </p><p>and analysis of the data and discussion at the </p><p>regional meetings to be held June 6 and 7. </p><p>OFDA/ARO and REDSO/FFP reps plan to participate in </p><p>these meetings and will subsequently report on </p><p>estimated levels of regional needs.  In addition, </p><p>OFDA/ARO and REDSO/FFP are also planning for a </p><p>series of follow-up assessments to further refine </p><p>needs assessments and recommendations for </p><p>response. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
