<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, NP, CH, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: 21 TIBETANS DETAINED ON IMMIGRATION CHARGES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Twenty-one Tibetan refugees, including </p><p>eleven minors, were detained by Nepal\'s Department of </p><p>Immigration (DOI) on April 15.  In an apparent toughening of </p><p>rhetoric, the Home Secretary was "quite adamant" in an April </p><p>17 meeting with Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk </p><p>Tsering that the group would be returned to China.  However, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>eighteen of the refugees have been fined, and will be </p><p>required to serve jail terms ranging from three to ten months </p><p>if they cannot pay.  The three youngest refugees (six to nine </p><p>years of age) will be released into the custody of UNHCR. </p><p>The GON has not informed UNHCR of any change in policy toward </p><p>Tibetans, but the latest arrests are part of a series of </p><p>incidents that violate the unwritten "gentleman\'s agreement" </p><p>governing the travel of Tibetans through Nepal to India. </p><p>Tibetan leaders have blamed the less tolerant attitude of the </p><p>Nepal Government on growing pressure from Beijing.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) A group of twenty-one Tibetan refugees, including </p><p>eleven minors, was arrested by GON authorities near Kathmandu </p><p>on April 15.  The undocumented refugees crossed into Nepal on </p><p>foot via Nangpa-La (a 17,000-foot pass in the Everest region) </p><p>then took a bus to the capital.  They were arrested at the </p><p>Thankot police checkpoint, about 10 miles from Kathmandu, and </p><p>immediately handed over to the Department of Immigration. </p><p>Eighteen members of the group have been jailed, pending </p><p>payment of approximately 100 USD each in fines and visa fees. </p><p> Failing payment, the refugees will be required to serve a </p><p>prison term of 10 months.  (Note: One thirteen-year-old boy </p><p>was given a half-fine, reducing his total required payment to </p><p>70 USD and his total possible prison term to 3 months. End </p><p>note.)  The three youngest members of the group (two </p><p>six-year-olds and a nine-year-old) will be released into </p><p>UNHCR custody.  Their parents were not among those detained. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering told </p><p>PolOff on April 17 that the Home Secretary had been "quite </p><p>adamant" that the refugees would be returned to China, </p><p>despite an informal agreement with UNHCR to allow Tibetans to </p><p>transit to India.   According to Tsering, the Home Secretary </p><p>claimed that "thousands" of Tibetans would flood the country </p><p>if the current UNHCR-administered process were allowed to </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UNHCR Protection Officer Giulia Ranawat said that her </p><p>office was pursuing the matter, and would seek a </p><p>clarification of the GON\'s current policy toward Tibetans </p><p>traveling to India.  "We have not received any notification </p><p>from the government of any change in policy, but they seem to </p><p>be arresting and fining people quite frequently," she said. </p><p>"We will be pressing them to find out if the procedure has </p><p>changed."  Ranawat indicated that UNHCR had not yet been </p><p>granted the opportunity to interview the refugees to </p><p>determine if they are persons of concern, but said that her </p><p>office had "valid reasons to assume" that they would be. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  The Home Secretary\'s concern about </p><p>"thousands" of Tibetans flooding Nepal on their way to the </p><p>UNHCR Reception Center is specious.  The number of refugees </p><p>processed by UNHCR has declined in the past few years to </p><p>under 1500 per annum, and those who do enter Nepal are </p><p>escorted out to India, primarily for free schooling in </p><p>Dharamsala.  The system has worked well for thirteen years, </p><p>but Tibetan leaders have reported increased pressure by the </p><p>Chinese Government on Nepal to crack down on Tibetan </p><p>immigrants.  Post will continue to work with UNHCR and the </p><p>Office of Tibet to determine if the so-called "gentleman\'s </p><p>agreement" has been abandoned by the GON, and what the </p><p>ramifications of such a decision would be for Tibetans, who </p><p>will likely continue to seek a way to join the Tibetan </p><p>community in India whether a protective agreement is in place </p><p>or not. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
