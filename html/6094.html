<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 4 AM: HIGH YIELDS IN T-BILL </p><p>AUCTION; DETAILS OF 2003 BUDGET MEASURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 193 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:   The GOT raised TL 2 quadrillion in two </p><p>Treasury debt auctions on March 4, but yields were high - </p><p>62.5 percent on the one-year bond.  This result, together </p><p>with the Treasury\'s TL 4.2 quadrillion cash reserve, is </p><p>sufficient to meet the March 5 debt redemption of TL 3.9 </p><p>quadrillion.  According to the general manager of Akbank, the </p><p>largest player in Turkey\'s domestic debt market, the </p><p>ramifications of the March 1 parliamentary vote are still </p><p>being felt in the markets.  "Not getting the U.S. package is </p><p>one thing, and there\'s still some hope there, but AK\'s </p><p>mishandling of this vote is causing lack of confidence in the </p><p>government which is not easily forgotten."  This lack of </p><p>market confidence in the GOT translates into higher interest </p><p>rates on T-bills, which will add to debt sustainability </p><p>questions. Also included in this report are the details of </p><p>the 2003 new budget measures announced March 3 - including </p><p>cuts to military spending, Northern Cyprus appropriation, </p><p>delays to the World Bank-supported "Direct Income Support" </p><p>for farmers, and two new taxes on real estate and vehicles. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets - Interest Rates Higher </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  At mid-day March 4, Turkish markets were stable, </p><p>though T-bills were trading at a much higher rate, </p><p>anticipating the high yields in today\'s T-bill auctions (see </p><p>below). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The benchmark (most heavily traded) T-bills were trading </p><p>at 62.50-63 percent in compounded terms. </p><p>--  The lira appreciated slightly from March 3 close, trading </p><p>at TL 1,642,000 to the dollar. </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange rebounded slighlty from </p><p>yesterday\'s 13 percent sell-off, and was up 1.6 percent at </p><p>noon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Akbank (Turkey\'s largest private sector bank and </p><p>largest T-bill investor) General Manager Zafer Kurtul told us </p><p>March 4 that PM Gul had called him, and other major Turkish </p><p>bank general managers, around midnight March 2 asking about </p><p>the likely market reaction to the parliamentary vote.  Kurtul </p><p>told us he said to Gul that the GOT needed to show the </p><p>markets a fiscally responsible budget (comment:  this advice </p><p>may have helped prompt GOT agreement with the IMF later that </p><p>evening).   Kurtul opined to us that the ramifications of the </p><p>March 1 vote are not over: "not getting the U.S. package is </p><p>one thing, and there is still some hope on that, but AK\'s </p><p>mishandling of this vote has caused major market lack of </p><p>confidence and that will not be easily forgotten." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March 4 Treasury Auction </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Turkish Treasury released the results of its March </p><p>4 auctions at 2:00 PM local time.  The total amount raised </p><p>(about TL 2 quadrillion) and the yields were within market </p><p>expectations.  However,  the Turkish banks are now asking a </p><p>significantly higher rate to roll-over the domestic debt, and </p><p>this will add to debt sustainability concerns already in the </p><p>markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                 Compounded Yield  Amt Sold </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1-Year Bond         62.5           TL 1.65 quad </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7-Month Bill        58.5           TL 0.36 quad </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Details of Fiscal Saving Measures </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Following are the fiscal saving measures released by </p><p>PM Gul on March 3.  They represent all fiscal measures agreed </p><p>with the IMF on the 2003 budget.  This list includes an </p><p>earlier set of measures announced January 8, reftel, but has </p><p>changed the fiscal impact of such measures in line with IMF </p><p>experience (for instance, the impact of the tax amnesty is </p><p>now TL 750 trillion, not TL 2.4 quadrillion as stated January </p><p>8). </p><p>5.  (U) Among the highlights of the new measures are:  public </p><p>investment cuts of TL 2.6 quadrillion (note: the World Bank </p><p>will share with us later the list of cut projects) and </p><p>military spending cuts (TL 450 trillion); delay of the </p><p>"Direct Income Support" (DIS) payments to farmers (TL 1.4 </p><p>quadrillion); and two new taxes on real estate and vehicles </p><p>(TL 1.750 quadrillion).  Though not a fiscal saving measure, </p><p>but still significant, the GOT agreement to include in the </p><p>definition of primary spending all "foreign-financed </p><p>investments" (these are foreign export credit agency-financed </p><p>goods imported by line ministries, including medical and </p><p>construction equipment and vehicles.)   This category of </p><p>primary spending was included in the budget for the first </p><p>time, and the overall amount was also cut. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Table of New Fiscal Measures for 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        trillion TL   % of GNP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Expenditure Measures </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Personnel, includes:        545        0.2 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Civil Servants </p><p> (limit new hires to </p><p>  35,000) </p><p>Public Workers </p><p> (postpone bonuses) </p><p>Limit pharmaceutical </p><p>  benefits </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Investment                4,105         1.2 </p><p> (stop new car purchases, </p><p>  cut foreign-financed </p><p>  purchases, rationalize list </p><p>  of investment projects) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other                      1,184       0.3 </p><p>  cut military spending      450 </p><p>  transfer unspent mil </p><p>  appropriations from last </p><p>  year                       270 </p><p>  cut health and education    50 </p><p>  other cuts                 414 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transfers                  3,967         1.1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Civil servant pension </p><p> fund restructuring            764       0.2 </p><p> Self-employed pension </p><p> fund restructuring            350       0.1 </p><p> Other Employee pension </p><p> fund restructuring            190       0.1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Other Transfers               2,315     0.7 </p><p> incl: cut transfer to Cyprus     50 </p><p> postpone "DIS" to farmers     1,400     0.4 </p><p> new reg on tax rebates for      294     0.1 </p><p> exports </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Expenditure sub-total:          9,801    2.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Revenue Measures, including: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Tax Amnesty                     750      0.2 </p><p>- New tax on real estate          650      0.2 </p><p>- New tax on vehicles           1,100      0.3 </p><p>- Revenue claw back of </p><p>  municipalities                  275      0.1 </p><p>- Cancel earmarking of revenues, </p><p>  return to central budget      1,440      0.4 </p><p>- eliminate lags in corporate </p><p>  tax collection                780        0.2 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Revenue sub-total                5,972     1.7 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total Savings                TL 15,773     4.4 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
