<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LOEVINGER, MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/OEURA/CDP/DDEFALCO </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S TAYLOR\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH GOT ON ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, DECEMBER 27-28 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: In his talks in Ankara December 28 and 29, </p><p>Treasury Under Secretary Taylor several times stressed the </p><p>need for the GOT to implement economic reform, specifying the </p><p>2003 primary budget surplus, resolution of two large banks, </p><p>and implementation of the Public Procurement Law as three key </p><p>issues.  In response, Deputy Prime Minister Sener, State </p><p>Minister in charge of Treasury Babacan and Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan separately confirmed that the GOT was committed to </p><p>continuing the existing IMF-backed economic reform program. </p><p>However, implementation of the program is stalled, and there </p><p>are no indications that the GOT is preparing necessary </p><p>actions to implement key program conditions.  U/S Taylor\'s </p><p>interlocutors did not commit to the 6.5 percent of GNP </p><p>primary budget surplus target for 2003.  Babacan said the </p><p>Public Procurement Law would be implemented on time in </p><p>January, but that the GOT would also seek to amend the law. </p><p>Taylor also discussed the general economic outlook with GOT </p><p>officials.  Year-end 2002 growth forecasts now range between </p><p>6.5 - 6.8 percent; the GOT and Central Bank have agreed on </p><p>2003 targets of 20 percent CPI increase and 5 percent GNP </p><p>growth.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Concern with Policy Slippage </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Treasury Under Secretary Taylor, during his </p><p>December 27-28 meetings in Ankara with Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Sener, State MInister Babacan and Finance Minister Unakitan, </p><p>raised the importance of Turkey\'s economic reform program. </p><p>Fully implementing this IMF-backed program is a key element </p><p>to maintaining market confidence.  Taylor stressed these </p><p>areas of concern over possible slippage: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Fiscal policy, especially the 6.5 percent of GNP primary </p><p>surplus, which Taylor noted is part of the government\'s </p><p>agreement with the IMF for 2003; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Banking sector reform, and in particular the banking </p><p>board\'s resolution of two undercapitalized banks (Pamuk and </p><p>Yapi Kredi); and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Public Procurement Law, passed in January 2002 and </p><p>scheduled to come into force in January 2003.  This law will </p><p>establish more transparent rules for, and allow foreign </p><p>participation in, bidding on government tenders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Babacan, Unakitan and Sener, in separate meetings, </p><p>said the new government was committed to continuing the </p><p>existing IMF program.  Babacan said the government agreed in </p><p>principle with the economic reform strategy of both the IMF </p><p>and World Bank, though there were disagreements over details </p><p>with both agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On fiscal policy, Babacan blamed the prior GOT </p><p>government for over-spending and creating a primary surplus </p><p>shortfall for 2002.  Treasury U/S Oztrak added that, while </p><p>the markets were expecting a 2002 primary surplus of 5 to 5.5 </p><p>percent of GNP, his latest estimates were that it would be </p><p>less - perhaps 4.5 percent of GNP.  Asked about the GOT\'s </p><p>commitment to the 6.5 primary surplus target for 2003, </p><p>Babacan said "we\'ll try."  He added that the 2003 budget </p><p>would increase social expenditures, given that 20 percent of </p><p>the population was below the official poverty line, but he </p><p>didn\'t specify expenditure cuts in other areas to pay for </p><p>these increases.  U/S Taylor noted the GOT\'s less than full </p><p>commitment to the 6.5 percent surplus, and said a full </p><p>commitment was needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Treasury U/S Oztrak said the GOT would generate </p><p>savings in 2003 through reforming health care expenditures. </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan further specified that cuts would </p><p>come from deferral of non-urgent investment projects, </p><p>reducing the fleet of state-owned vehicles, controlling </p><p>pharmaceutical costs, and a performance-based program for </p><p>overall government downsizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On structural reforms in the banking sector, </p><p>Babacan stressed that the GOT was committed to independence </p><p>of the banking board (BRSA) and "has empowered this agency to </p><p>do its job."  Of course, he continued, there is a need to </p><p>improve the BRSA\'s operations, but any changes made would be </p><p>in the direction of increasing the agency\'s transparency and </p><p>its reporting to the public.  He added that that the </p><p>resolution of two banks was in the courts system, the GOT </p><p>could not interfere.   On the Public Procurement Law, Babacan </p><p>said there were "some problems in implementation."  Unakitan </p><p>said bureaucrats were claiming that the law might interfere </p><p>with basic government operations.  But the GOT had decided to </p><p>implement it on time in January 2003, and at the same time to </p><p>seek several "technical amendments to correct the law\'s </p><p>flaws."  (Comment:  World Bank contacts tell us the 16 </p><p>amendments proposed by the GOT, if passed by parliament, </p><p>would in effect gut the law by excluding procurement by </p><p>municipalities and state economic enterprises. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Babacan described two economic policy initiatives </p><p>of the new government - in privatization and foreign direct </p><p>investment (FDI).  He stressed that no government in Turkey </p><p>had ever had such strong political support for privatization: </p><p>the GOT was committed to accelerating privatization and would </p><p>release its 2003 program in January to implement this vision. </p><p>  Furthermore, the new GOT sees FDI as crucial.  The GOT </p><p>would soon submit five separate laws to parliament aimed at </p><p>encouraging FDI; it has also established an inter-agency </p><p>coordinating committee to enhance the investment climate, </p><p>staffed at the undersecretary (i.e., agency head) level, </p><p>which includes private sector representatives and which </p><p>Babacan will chair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Taylor welcomed this focus on privatization and </p><p>FDI, in addition to the other IMF program conditions.  He </p><p>stressed, however, that markets will focus on the budget and </p><p>on the banking sector issues as well as FDI.  He warned that </p><p>the 2002 primary budget shortfall will require a IMF board </p><p>waiver, and he noted that the IMF board will question what </p><p>the GOT has done to reduce this shortfall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic Outlook for Year-End 2002 and 2003 </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Taylor also discussed Turkey\'s economy with State </p><p>Minister Babacan, Central Bank Governor Serdengecti, Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak, and State Planning Undersecretary Tiktik over </p><p>lunch December 28.  Taylor began by asking Governor </p><p>Serdengecti his view of the recent declines in Turkish </p><p>financial markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Serdengecti said there were two main reasons: </p><p>first, conflicting statements from various politicians had </p><p>caused worries in the markets over the GOT"s commitment to </p><p>economic reform; and second, talk of an imminent war in Iraq </p><p>had added to the volatility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) On prospects for growth, SPO head Tiktik said his </p><p>agency estimates year-end 2002 growth will be 6.8 percent, </p><p>while Treasury U/S Oztrak puts the figure at 6.5 percent. </p><p>Central Bank Governor Serdengecti commented that this strong </p><p>performance shows the Turkish economy\'s resilience - this </p><p>sort of rebound also happened after the 1994 crisis.  The </p><p>rebound this time has been broad-based:  agricultural </p><p>production helped, but so did tourism and industry. </p><p>Exporters showed their adaptability in the face of slow </p><p>growth in Europe which is the main export market. But, </p><p>Serdengecti continued, Turkey needs stable, sustainable </p><p>growth.  By the third quarter of 2003, Turkey reached the </p><p>industrial production levels of 1997 and 2000 - the two peaks </p><p>of the past decade.  Further growth will only come from </p><p>productivity gains through private sector investment, he </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Serdengecti and Oztrak affirmed that the GOT and </p><p>Central Bank had agreed on several key macro-economic targets </p><p>for 2003: the 20 percent CPI increase, and the 5 percent GNP </p><p>growth target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Treasury has cleared this message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
