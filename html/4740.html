<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 006002 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR IO, IO/UNP, IO/SHA, DRL, DRL/MA AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/15/2004 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, IT, PREL, IT, LY, UN, LYPHUM, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: CHR-59 LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP: ITALIANS COULD ACCEPT </p><p>"CONSTRUCTIVE" LETTER OR STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 258439 B) ROME 5802 C) STATE 244156 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M/C TOM COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ITALY CONTINUES TO OPPOSE CONFRONTATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06002  01 OF 02  161821Z </p><p>TACTICS TO OVERTURN LIBYA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP OF CHR-59 THAT COULD </p><p>DAMAGE THE COMMISSION\'S LONGER-TERM VIABILITY OR THAT LEAD </p><p>PIECEMEAL TO A FORCED VOTE ON THE MATTER.  THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REFLEXIVE SUPPORT FOR U.S. POLICY HAS, IN THIS </p><p>NARROW CASE, BEEN TRUMPED BY AN UNYIELDING SUPPORT FOR THE UN </p><p>SYSTEM, AND ITS CONSENSUAL DECISION-MAKING, AND A BELIEF THAT </p><p>THEIR POLICY OF ENGAGING LIBYA IS SLOWLY MOVING QADAFFI IN </p><p>THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  THE ITALIANS HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT </p><p>QADAFFI\'S REGIME AND WOULD WORK IN ADVANCE TO PREVENT MORE </p><p>PROMINENT LIBYAN POSITIONS IN THE UN SYSTEM.  BUT THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THE MORE CEREMONIAL NATURE OF THE CHR CHAIRMANSHIP </p><p>MAKES IT AN APPROPRIATE POSITION TO TEST AND ENCOURAGE </p><p>QADAFFI\'S COMMITMENT TO REHABILITATING LIBYA\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>STANDING.  THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO JEOPARDIZE\'S THE </p><p>COMMISSION\'S FUTURE EFFECTIVENESS -- AND THEIR OWN FUTURE </p><p>CANDIDACY --  THROUGH AN OPEN-ENDED SERIES OF CRITICAL WEOG </p><p>LETTERS AND STATEMENTS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED CONDITIONALLY TO </p><p>SUPPORT A WEOG LETTER OF CONCERN AND, PERHAPS, A GROUP </p><p>STATEMENT ON LIBYA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP, OFFICIALS AT PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE MFA TOLD US DECEMBER 16.  THEIR </p><p>LIKELY SUPPORT FOR A LETTER OR STATEMENT WOULD BE CONTINGENT </p><p>UPON: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OVERALL STRATEGY: ITALY WOULD NOT AGREE TO AN </p><p>OPEN-ENDED, PIECEMEAL APPROACH THAT PRODUCED A SERIES OF </p><p>AD-HOC MEASURES CULMINATING IN A JANUARY 20 VOTE IF THE </p><p>LIBYAN CANDIDATE WAS NOT REPLACED.  SUCH AN ESCALATORY </p><p>APPROACH WOULD BE OVERLY CONFRONTATIONAL, REDUCING PROSPECTS </p><p>FOR ANY PRODUCTIVE WORK AT THIS YEAR\'S CHR AND ENDANGERING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06002  01 OF 02  161821Z </p><p>THE WEOG\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN FUTURE COMMISSIONS.  ITALY COULD </p><p>ACCEPT A LETTER OR STATEMENT IN LIEU OF A VOTE: BUT NOT AS A </p><p>FIRST STEP THAT CULMINATED IN A VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TONE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE LETTER AND/OR STATEMENT: </p><p>IT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLY CRITICAL OF THE AFRICAN GROUP FOR </p><p>SELECTING LIBYA BUT SHOULD INSTEAD CONCENTRATE ON STATING </p><p>CLEARLY WEOG EXPECTATIONS AND RED LINES FOR LIBYA\'S </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE, WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THE DANGER IN PULLING THE </p><p>PUNCH TOO MUCH; IN THAT SCENARIO, WE COULD END UP WITH BOTH A </p><p>WEAK OR DISUNIFIED EXPRESSION OF CONCERN (OUR LEAST-FAVORED </p><p>OUTCOME) AND A CONFRONTATIONAL VOTE, THE GOI\'S LEAST-FAVORED </p><p>OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CONTACTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE TOLD US PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI WAS AWARE OF THE LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP ISSUE; THE PM </p><p>WANTED AN OUTCOME GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH HIS POLICY  OF </p><p>REALISTIC ENGAGEMENT WITH LIBYA REINFORCED BY HIS OCTOBER </p><p>VISIT TO TRIPOLI.  DURING THAT VISIT, THE ITALIAN DELEGATION </p><p>(THOUGH NOT BERLUSCONI PERSONALLY) HAD DISCUSSED WITH THE </p><p>LIBYANS A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES -- INCLUDING THE CHR </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP -- THAT COULD GRADUALLY REINTEGRATE LIBYA INTO </p><p>THE WIDER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  AS A RESULT, ITALY WAS IN </p><p>THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF SUPPORTING BROAD WEOG EFFORTS TO </p><p>REGISTER CONCERNS ABOUT LIBYA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP WITHOUT </p><p>VIOLATING ITS BILATERAL COMMITMENT TO TRIPOLI, MADE BEFORE </p><p>THE U.S. EXPRESSED ITS STRONG OPPOSITION TO A LIBYAN CHAIR. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, WE LEARNED SEPARATELY FROM MAGHREB OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR BELLAVIA, ITALY WAS PURSUING A STATEMENT THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06002  01 OF 02  161821Z </p><p>CREATED A FRAMEWORK AND OUTLINED WEOG EXPECTATIONS FOR THE </p><p>UPCOMING CHR SESSION RATHER THAN ONE THAT EXCESSIVELY </p><p>CRITICIZED THE AFRICA GROUP\'S SELECTION OF LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) EVEN BEFORE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN GENEVA, WE HAD </p><p>BEEN PRESSING THE CASE AGAINST LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP AT </p><p>SUCCESSIVELY HIGHER LEVELS, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>CONVEYING WEOG CONCERNS PRIOR TO THE HOLIDAY RECESS.  WITH </p><p>MINOR VARIATIONS, THE REPLY HAS BEEN THE SAME: SKEPTICISM </p><p>THAT THE AFRICA GROUP COULD BE PERSUADED TO NOMINATE ANOTHER </p><p>CHAIR MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMISSION\'S IDEALS; AND </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO THE NORMAL COMITY AMONG UN </p><p>REGIONAL GROUPS.  THE LATTER CONCERN CLEARLY REVOLVES AROUND </p><p>ITALY\'S PROSPECTIVE TENURE ON (AND, PERHAPS, CHAIRMANSHIP OF) </p><p>THE 2004 SESSION OF THE COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) REINFORCING THE ITALIAN VIEW IS THE RELATIVE PAUCITY, </p><p>IN THEIR ANALYSIS, OF COMPELLING ALTERNATIVE CHAIRS WITHIN </p><p>THE AFRICA GROUP.  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR NEA BADINI </p><p>COUNTERED DCM\'S DECEMBER 6 PITCH ON THE ISSUE BY OBSERVING </p><p>THAT LIBYA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD WAS NOT WORSE THAN ITS </p><p>MAGHREB NEIGHBORS OR, FOR THAT MATTER, THOSE OF MOST MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE AFRICA GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1076 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  06002  02 OF 02  161821Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------18853E  161822Z /38 </p><p>O 161816Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7341 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 006002 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C) COMMENT: THE ITALIANS HAVE SUPPORTED VIRTUALLY EVERY </p><p>MAJOR U.S. INITIATIVE SINCE PM BERLUSCONI ENTERED OFFICE 18 </p><p>MONTHS AGO (INCLUDING STEPPING ASIDE WITHIN THE WEOG TO ALLOW </p><p>THE U.S. TO REGAIN A SEAT IN THE 2003 SESSION OF THE HUMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06002  02 OF 02  161821Z </p><p>RIGHTS COMMISSION).  BUT THAT SUPPORT TAILS OFF WHEN THE </p><p>OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE UN SYSTEM OR, IN THIS CASE, ONE </p><p>OF ITS COMPONENTS, IS THREATENED (IN THEIR VIEW) BY AN OVERLY </p><p>SPECIFIC U.S. OBJECTIVE.  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL NOT </p><p>SUPPORT MEASURES WITHIN THE WEOG THAT ARE, IN THEIR VIEW, </p><p>LITTLE MORE THAN SPEED BUMPS ON THE ROAD TO A </p><p>"CONFRONTATIONAL" VOTE JANUARY 20.  BUT THEY ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>EXPLORE LANGUAGE THAT PUTS THE WEOG ON RECORD, AND LIBYA AND </p><p>THE AFRICA GROUP ON NOTICE, REGARDING OUR CONCERNS AND </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR THE 2003 SESSION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06002 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
