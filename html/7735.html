<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE FOR OSD/NESA </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA AND PM/RSAT </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PARM, MOPS, GCC, AF, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD MEETING </p><p>WITH UAE ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>SHAYKH MUHAMMAD BIN ZAYID AL-NAHYAN </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY: SecDef met with UAE Armed Forces </p><p>Chief of Staff LTG Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>(MbZ) on April 27 in Abu Dhabi.  After </p><p>congratulating SecDef on Operation Iraqi Freedom, </p><p>MbZ made the following points:  (1) There is a </p><p>narrow window to curtail Iranian influence among </p><p>Iraqi Shi\'a groups.  (2) Iran is a regional threat </p><p>and the leadership in Tehran uses the "American and </p><p>Israeli enemy" to maintain control.  (3) Jordan\'s </p><p>King Abdullah is a courageous leader who deserves </p><p>our support.  SecDef made the following points: </p><p>(1) He thanked the UAE for its support in the </p><p>liberation of Iraq.  (2) While it is understandable </p><p>for Iraq\'s neighbors, including Iran and Syria, to </p><p>have an interest, we cannot abdicate to them </p><p>control of Iraq\'s internal affairs. (3) Syria has </p><p>played an unhelpful role, although Bashar Al-Asad </p><p>appears to be getting the message to some extent. </p><p>(4) The U.S.  provides support to Jordan and </p><p>encourages others to follow suit.  (5) The U.S. has </p><p>made progress in training the Afghan National Army, </p><p>but it is important that this progress be </p><p>accelerated.  CENTCOM Commander Gen. Franks and </p><p>Amb. Wahba joined SecDef. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM:  MbZ congratulated </p><p>SecDef on the "amazing" success of Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom against an Iraqi regime that was the enemy </p><p>of both the U.S. and the UAE.  SecDef thanked MbZ </p><p>for the UAE\'s cooperation; the role played by the </p><p>UAE and Kuwait helped speed up the operation and </p><p>saved lives.  SecDef credited General Franks and </p><p>his team for the success of the plan and the </p><p>campaign.  There was a minimum loss of life, no </p><p>environmental damage, no ballistic missiles fired </p><p>at neighboring states and virtually no outflow of </p><p>refugees. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN IRAQ:  SecDef asked MbZ </p><p>about Iran\'s influence in Iraq.  MbZ replied that </p><p>Iran concerns everyone.  Anticipating Saddam\'s </p><p>fall, the Iranians seized the opportunity to gain </p><p>the confidence and loyalty of "their Shi\'a groups" </p><p>in Iraq.  Though the Emiratis would not object to a </p><p>Shi\'a president if elected, they would be concerned </p><p>by the emergence of a powerful Shi\'a religious </p><p>figure.  In his view, we are in a critical period, </p><p>during which we have an opportunity to encourage </p><p>the emergence of moderate Shi\'a leaders and </p><p>circumscribe Iranian influence.  SecDef </p><p>acknowledged that the transition from Saddam\'s rule </p><p>may be bumpy; while it is understandable for Iraq\'s </p><p>neighbors, including Iran and Syria, to have some </p><p>influence, abdicating control to them is </p><p>unacceptable. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) IRANIAN THREAT TO THE REGION:  MbZ and </p><p>SecDef agreed that Iran poses a significant </p><p>regional and international threat.  SecDef hoped </p><p>for internal change in Iran; he doubted that young </p><p>Iranians will want to be ruled by the clerics </p><p>indefinitely.  MbZ said the Iranian leadership has </p><p>successfully used the concept of the "enemy" </p><p>Americans and Israelis to maintain control.  Seven </p><p>years ago, Rafsanjani\'s brother had told him that </p><p>Iran would not stop developing its technology until </p><p>it had in its arsenal a missile that could reach </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) SYRIA UNHELPFUL:  When asked whether Syria </p><p>had been cooperating as we wanted, SecDef said no. </p><p>On balance Syria had been unhelpful, and "unwisely </p><p>so."  Damascus had stopped weapons from crossing </p><p>the border when the U.S. cautioned Syria, but </p><p>allowed busloads of mercenaries to cross into Iraq. </p><p>SecDef stated that Bashar Al-Asad seems to be </p><p>getting the message after the intervention of Hosni </p><p>Mubarak and others.  While he did not think Al-Asad </p><p>will allow more wanted Iraqis into Syria, SecDef </p><p>believed that the Syrian leader will permit the </p><p>exit of those already in Syria.  MbZ reported that </p><p>Shaykh Zayid had dispatched UAE Information </p><p>Minister Abdullah bin Zayid to Damascus to warn </p><p>them to be careful, only 48 hours before SecDef </p><p>spoke publicly about Syria\'s unhelpful role. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) JORDAN DESERVES OUR SUPPORT: SecDef asked </p><p>MbZ for his assessment of how his friend King </p><p>Abdullah weathered the Iraq conflict.  MbZ said  he </p><p>thought Abdullah was in "reasonable shape."  MbZ </p><p>admired Abdullah\'s courage in backing the OIF </p><p>coalition -- 180 degrees from what his father had </p><p>done during Desert Storm.  SecDef and MbZ agreed </p><p>that Jordan deserves our support.  "If anyone </p><p>deserves our support, he does," SecDef agreed </p><p>fully. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) AFGHANISTAN:  SecDef asked MbZ\'s view of the </p><p>situation in Afghanistan.  MbZ said a UAE military </p><p>team had just returned from Kabul and reported it </p><p>was calm and secure, "like any other city."  SecDef </p><p>noted the past footdragging of MoD and regional </p><p>leaders.  It was two steps forward, one step back. </p><p>A number of Afghan National Army (ANA) battalions </p><p>were trained, but they are not yet linked to the </p><p>Defense Ministry.  It is important that ANA </p><p>training be accelerated to build confidence in the </p><p>central government. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) SecDef has reviewed and cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
