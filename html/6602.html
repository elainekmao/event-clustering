<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000800 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/CIP TFINTON </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR KSHAGRIN AND JMCHALE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD </p><p>SUBJECT: 1377 REVIEW: CANADA CONSIDERING RESPONSE TO ISP </p><p>APPLICATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 50683 </p><p> </p><p>1. Econoff contacted CRTC Executive Director for </p><p>Telecommunications Shirley Soehn to solicit information on </p><p>how Canada planned to address the issues raised Reftel. </p><p>Soehn noted that the CRTC received an Application from the </p><p>Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) regarding </p><p>the "anti-competitive provision of high-speed access and </p><p>retail Internet services, including \'lite\' service, by </p><p>incumbent cable and telephone carriers."  Soehn stated that </p><p>ISP\'s already have non-discriminatory access to cable </p><p>infrastructure at wholesale rates set by the CRTC and that it </p><p>was not a requirement that CRTC address this issue of access </p><p>to "lite" Internet service.  However, the CRTC is currently </p><p>reviewing the application and follow-on submissions and would </p><p>be making a recommendation to the CRTC Commissioner.  Soehn </p><p>did not provide a time-frame for a conclusion of the </p><p>proceedings on CAIP\'s application.  Details on the various </p><p>submissions can be found on the CRTC web site at: </p><p>www.crtc.gc.ca/PartVII/end/2002/8622/c51-03.h tm. </p><p> </p><p>2. Soehn commented that she was surprised that this issue had </p><p>been raised in the context of USTR\'s annual 1377 review given </p><p>that "Canadian regulations go well beyond those in the U.S." </p><p>in providing ISP\'s with access to incumbent\'s high speed </p><p>Internet networks. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
