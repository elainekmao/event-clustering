<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000747 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, US, IZ, CZ </p><p>SUBJECT: CZECH AMBASSADOR "OFFERS" FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a conversation on the evening of February 27 Czech </p><p>Ambassador Jana Hybashkova (please protect) told the </p><p>Ambassador that her country had a field hospital that it was </p><p>prepared to deploy to the AOR for possible duty in Iraq upon </p><p>US request.  She said that all the internal political </p><p>approvals had already been obtained (as a byproduct of </p><p>obtaining the approvals for the Czech contribution to the </p><p>CJTF-CM).  The only reason her government had not yet come </p><p>forward to offer the hospital was financial.  Recent </p><p>increases in its contribution to the CJTF-CM and an upcoming </p><p>contribution of SOF forces for Afghanistan have depleted the </p><p>Czech military\'s discretionary financial resources </p><p>completely.  Hybashkova doubted that they could even pay for </p><p>transport.  However, if the US requested the hospital and was </p><p>prepared to help with transport/expenses, she was sure the </p><p>hospital would be made available.  She added that the 150-bed </p><p>unit could handle 500-600 casualties per day.  It had seen </p><p>action in Kosovo and Afghanistan already; the members of its </p><p>staff were proven performers. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment:  We have shared the above information with </p><p>CFLCC and been advised that it is interested in this </p><p>prospective offer.  CENTCOM and/or Embassy Prague may wish to </p><p>pursue the matter with Czech authorities as appropriate. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
