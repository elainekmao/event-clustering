(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Richard A. Albright </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: The UAEG will welcome the </p><p>Middle East Trade Initiative (METI) and its comprehensive </p><p>efforts to encourage economic reform and enhance economic </p><p>growth in the region -- particularly if METI is defined in </p><p>unambiguously non-political terms.  The UAE sees itself as </p><p>a model of economic prosperity and diversity for other Arab </p><p>countries, and will likely view the Initiative more as a </p><p>mechanism to enhance economic reform elsewhere in the </p><p>region.  Post recommends that any approach to the UAE </p><p>regarding the Middle East Trade Initiative focus on areas </p><p>where we can reinforce the already strong bilateral </p><p>economic relationship, and refrain from suggesting that our </p><p>goal is to reform the UAE economy.  The GCC -- the only </p><p>existing free trade area in the Middle East -- is a ready </p><p>vehicle through which the USG could approach the Gulf </p><p>countries on the Middle East Trade Initiative.  The </p><p>countries of the GCC face similar economic problems -- </p><p>which vary significantly from the economic challenges of </p><p>other countries in the Middle East -- and the GCC offers </p><p>the perfect venue for addressing such issues collectively. </p><p>End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>The UAE Can Benefit From The Initiative </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Although the UAE is well ahead of the rest of the </p><p>region in terms of economic diversity and private sector </p><p>participation, the Middle East Trade Initiative could </p><p>encourage the UAE\'s compliance with international workers\' </p><p>rights and protection, support workforce skills </p><p>development, and the revamping/updating of the local </p><p>commercial and agency laws and courts -- all of which </p><p>hinder foreign investment in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UAE officials have also welcomed targeted WTO </p><p>training -- especially in Trade in Services and TRIPs -- </p><p>and raised the issue at the U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue in </p><p>Washington in November.  Post believes that the UAE could </p><p>also benefit from training in Government Procurement and </p><p>Intellectual Property Rights, specifically.  A better </p><p>understanding of agreements related to Customs Valuation </p><p>Methods, Rules of Origin, and Standards as Non-Tariff </p><p>Barriers to Trade are also critical to the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The long-term presence in the Gulf of an American </p><p>trade expert, who could educate the UAEG on its specific </p><p>WTO obligations and explain U.S. positions in multilateral </p><p>negotiations, would be a welcomed sign that we are serious </p><p>about strengthening our economic ties to the UAE and the </p><p>region.  Given the UAE\'s reputation as the regional trading </p><p>hub, the UAEG may offer to cover the costs of trade </p><p>experts, host training sessions, and even propose a </p><p>permanent regional training facility in the UAE for trade- </p><p>related programs. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Approach The UAE Through The GCC </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GCC is an existing free trade zone that -- </p><p>although is experiencing problems with the logistics of its </p><p>customs union -- is politically committed to economic </p><p>integration.  The USG has secured a number of agreements </p><p>with the GCC in the past, including most recently the </p><p>Multilateral Open Skies Agreement.  This agreement began as </p><p>several concurrent bilateral initiatives with individual </p><p>GCC members, and morphed into a regional Open Skies </p><p>Agreement with the GCC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The GCC is the best forum to discuss trade- </p><p>institution building in the Gulf and the UAE\'s specific </p><p>trade-related concerns, as well.  Such an approach might </p><p>also usefully address issues arising from the </p><p>implementation of the GCC Customs Union in terms of WTO </p><p>obligations, and standards issues.  Such discussions could </p><p>take place during the regular (but currently overdue) </p><p>meetings of the U.S.-GCC Economic Dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Israel Will Be A Problem </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>8. (C) The GCC forum would also provide political cover for </p><p>sensitive political decisions regarding trade with Israel. </p><p>Although the UAE no longer enforces the secondary and </p><p>tertiary aspects of the Arab League boycott of Israel, some </p><p>government contracts continue to contain pro forma </p><p>provisions requiring companies to observe the regulations </p><p>of the Arab League regarding the boycott.  A political </p><p>decision at the highest level of the UAEG will be necessary </p><p>to initiate trade ties with Israel.  The UAE is unlikely to </p><p>make such a decision unilaterally, and without consent of </p><p>its GCC neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
