(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  The controversial Abu Dhabi-based, Arab </p><p>League-affiliated and UAEG-funded Zayid Center for </p><p>Coordination and Follow-Up (ZCCF) will cease temporarily </p><p>all of its activities this summer, and will have a new </p><p>board of trustees and executive staff in the fall, the </p><p>Ambassador learned during a meeting July 5 with Mohammad </p><p>Habroush al-Suwaidi, a close adviser of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>ruling family.  The decision, coming after months of </p><p>engagement by the Ambassador at senior levels of the UAEG, </p><p>should put this issue to rest.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador met July 5 with Mohammad Habroush </p><p>al-Suwaidi, who is chairman of the National Bank of Abu </p><p>Dhabi, a member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council and </p><p>Supreme Petroleum Council, and a close confidant of the Abu </p><p>Dhabi ruling family and plays the role of advisor to the </p><p>Crown Prince, Shaykh Khalifa.  Over the past two years, the </p><p>Ambassador has developed a good working relationship with </p><p>Habroush who maintains a very low public profile.  In the </p><p>meeting, the Ambassador explained the USG view on the ZCCF, </p><p>just as she has done in previous meetings with Abu Dhabi\'s </p><p>senior leadership over the past nine months.  Habroush told </p><p>the Ambassador that both he and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince </p><p>Sheikh Khalifa were very concerned by the negative press </p><p>that the ZCCF was receiving, and agreed "100 percent" with </p><p>the USG position that the Center is no longer promoting </p><p>President Zayid\'s philosophies, including a message of </p><p>tolerance, understanding, and a pro-American policy. </p><p>Habroush added that Sh. Khalifa appointed him as his </p><p>emissary to meet one-on-one with his half-brother the </p><p>Center\'s patron, Deputy Prime Minister Sultan bin Zayid, </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s second eldest son. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In their one-on-one meeting, Sultan was reportedly </p><p>cooperative and said he never meant any harm to his father. </p><p>He conceded that some of the speakers and activities at the </p><p>Center had tarnished his father\'s reputation and were not </p><p>in keeping with his father\'s policies and ideology.  Sultan </p><p>further agreed that all of the Center\'s public activities </p><p>should cease for the summer, and that the executive staff </p><p>was in need of an overhaul.  In addition, to ensure better </p><p>oversight, the Center will get a new board of trustees this </p><p>fall.  MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid, in a telcon with the </p><p>Ambassador July 6, confirmed the steps Habroush outlined. </p><p>The Ambassador has repeatedly engaged the senior UAEG </p><p>leadership on the need to make substantive changes at the </p><p>Center, a "think tank" that has sponsored a series of </p><p>offensive lectures, released publications containing </p><p>noxious material about Judaism, and allowed anti-semitic </p><p>language on its website. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Habroush assured the Ambassador that the Center </p><p>will no longer tolerate anti-American, anti-semitic, or </p><p>other offensive messages.  (Note: There was no discussion </p><p>of the Center\'s website, but we assume that it will be </p><p>cleaned up as well.  End note.)  Although there had been </p><p>talk of changing the Center\'s name to remove any reference </p><p>to Shaykh Zayid, Sultan\'s willingness to do the needful </p><p>with regard to staffing, activities and programs is </p><p>sufficient, Habroush said. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Ambassador told Habroush that she would convey </p><p>these positive developments to Washington.  The Embassy has </p><p>seen US press reports citing Harvard President Lawrence </p><p>Summers saying he will decide in the next two weeks whether </p><p>to accept a gift from Shaykh Zayid to establish a chair for </p><p>Islamic Religious Studies.  When queried this spring by the </p><p>Divinity School\'s Dean, we told Harvard that while the ZCCF </p><p>is funded by the UAEG, it does not necessarily reflect the </p><p>views of the UAEG or Shaykh Zayed personally.  Harvard </p><p>isn\'t the only educational institution with questions about </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s generosity.  We have seen US press reports </p><p>about a new controversy involving a $15,000 donation by </p><p>Shaykh Zayid to the Las Flores Elementary School in </p><p>southern California.  The school reportedly needs the funds </p><p>to save teachers\' jobs.  The School Superintendent has </p><p>asked Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach for help in </p><p>researching Sheykh Zayid\'s "background" before deciding </p><p>whether the school can keep his money. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  In the end, credit goes to Khalifa, </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s eldest son, for acting decisively by </p><p>engaging one-on-one with his younger half-brother (albeit </p><p>by deploying a close ally of Shaykh Zayid, perhaps to save </p><p>the embarrassment entailed in a face-to-face consultation). </p><p>The Ambassador\'s senior interlocutors had cautioned that </p><p>any move against Sultan by his younger half-brothers - de </p><p>facto Defense Minister Muhammad bin Zayid and MFA Minstate </p><p>Hamdan, would be viewed as an outright power play.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Biographic note:  Habroush is related to Ahmed bin </p><p>Khalifa al-Suweidi, the UAEG\'s first foreign minister and </p><p>an architect of UAE federation.  He wields considerable </p><p>political power behind the scenes through his close </p><p>relationship with CP Khalifa and his membership on the </p><p>Executive and Petroleum Councils of Abu Dhabi. </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
