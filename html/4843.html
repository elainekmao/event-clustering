<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0422 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          DECEMBER 13, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for </p><p>December 13, 2002.  Please note that Turkish press reports </p><p>often contain errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana </p><p>does not vouch for the accuracy of the reports summarized </p><p>here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ANTI-WAR DECLARATION </p><p>(Bolge/Bolge)  The Cukurova University (Adana) Teaching </p><p>Staff Association issued a written statement calling for </p><p>opposition to the proposed U.S. operation against Iraq. </p><p>The statement said:  "The U.S. is preparing for an </p><p>operation against Iraq taking shelter behind the words </p><p>`terror and democracy.\'  The U.S. has been trying to </p><p>maintain its international relations by the way of war </p><p>because the economic basis on which its power is based has </p><p>gradually weakened.  We are concerned over the possibility </p><p>of Turkish support for such an operation intended to bring </p><p>oil regions under control.  With all our might, we are </p><p>saying "No" to (this) war.  We simply oppose the U.S. </p><p>preparing to become the world empire."  Evrensel reported a </p><p>group of Cukurova University students issued a press </p><p>release under the December 10-17 Human Rights Week </p><p>criticizing anti-democratic practices in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  FAREWELL TO ARMS IN OHAL </p><p>(Radikal/Milli Gazete/Evrensel)  In the Southeast, licenses </p><p>to carry weapons which were issued during the State of </p><p>Emergency (OHAL) due to personal security will be replaced </p><p>with licenses to own weapons.  Licenses of those who fail </p><p>to apply by January 16 will be declared null and void and </p><p>their weapons seized.  Village guards do not fall within </p><p>the scope of this practice, because officials said the fact </p><p>that OHAL was abolished does not mean the village guard </p><p>system has also been lifted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PARLIAMENTARY HRC WILL MAKE ITS FIRST TOUR IN SE </p><p>(Radikal)  The Parliamentary Human Rights Commission will </p><p>make its first tour of inspections in the Southeast, from </p><p>where many complaints are received.  The Commission\'s </p><p>President, Mehmet Elkatmis (AKP\'s Nigde Deputy), said the </p><p>commission would investigate all kinds of allegations of </p><p>human rights abuses, eventually coming up with a road map </p><p>on human rights.  According to Elkatmis, torture will be </p><p>the main item on the commission\'s agenda.  "With laws to be </p><p>passed, there will be no more human rights abuses," </p><p>Elkatmis pledged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  SES OFFICIAL "EXILED" </p><p>(Evrensel)  Health Employees\' Union (SES) Bingol chapter </p><p>President Muharrem Aydinalp and his wife Mevlude Aydinalp </p><p>were transferred to Erzurum province, allegedly due to </p><p>Aydinalp\'s union-related activities.  The decision was </p><p>reportedly made although an August investigation against </p><p>Aydinalp turned up no criminal activity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  HEROIN SEIZURE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Gurpinar (Van) District Security Directorate\'s </p><p>Anti-smuggling and Organized Crime teams seized 79.491 </p><p>kilograms of heroin in four bags in the search of a home in </p><p>Yukari Kaymak Quarter.  Over 100 kilograms of unprocessed </p><p>narcotics were also seized.  Police arrested one suspect </p><p>who had been preparing to transport the seized drug to </p><p>another province in a vehicle\'s 80-liter LPG tank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  EU SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION </p><p>(Milliyet)  The Adana National Education Directorate has </p><p>launched a campaign to get its share of the EUR 12 million </p><p>(approx. USD 12.2 million) donated by the EU for "Basic </p><p>Education Support Project" to be carried out in big </p><p>provinces such as Adana, Mersin, Antalya, Bursa and </p><p>Istanbul, which attract intense migration from the </p><p>Southeast.  Adana National Education Director Gungor Kose </p><p>said the project went into effect on September 11 as a </p><p>result of the February 8, 2000 protocol agreement signed </p><p>between the EU and the National Education Ministry.  The </p><p>donation will be used to educate adults, street and working </p><p>children, as well as to turn some schools into multi- </p><p>purpose educational centers for the purpose of training </p><p>illiterate women, girls, and street and working children </p><p>especially in slum areas. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
