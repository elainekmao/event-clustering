<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, ECON, KIRF, CA, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: CLONING CLAIM PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON QUEBEC-BASED </p><p>RAELIAN GROUP </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: THE FOLLOWING IS SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE MONTREAL-BASED RAELIAN GROUP, WHOSE MEMBER DR. BRIGITTE </p><p>BOISSELIER ANNOUNCED AT A DECEMBER 27 PRESS CONFERENCE IN </p><p>HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST CLONED HUMAN </p><p>BEING, A 7 POUND BABY GIRL NICKNAMED EVE. AND ITS TWO MAIN </p><p>FIGURES LEADER CLAUDE VORILHON, BETTER KNOWN AS RAEL, AND </p><p>DR. BOISSELIER.  ONE LIKELY RESULT OF THE BOISSELIER </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT CANADA\'S PENDING LEGISLATION TO BAN </p><p>HUMAN CLONING COULD CONTAIN STRICTER RESTRICTIONS. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE RAELIAN MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED BY FRENCHMAN CLAUDE </p><p>VORILHON, A FORMER SPORTS JOURNALIST, FAILED SINGER, RADIO </p><p>COMMENTATOR AND AVID STOCK CAR RACER. VORILHON CLAIMS TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED ON DECEMBER 25, 1945, BY A FRENCH MOTHER </p><p>AND AN ALIEN FATHER. SPECIALISTS SAY HE WAS BORN IN VICHY, </p><p>FRANCE IN 1946. VORILHON WHO USES THE NAME RAEL  (GOD\'S </p><p>LIGHT) (PRONOUNCED RA-EL IN FRENCH (RHYMES WITH KAL-EL AND </p><p>JOR-EL)) SAYS HE CREATED THE MOVEMENT AFTER ALIENS VISITED </p><p>HIM IN CENTRAL FRANCE IN 1973. AT THAT TIME, LITTLE GREEN </p><p>ALIENS (APPROXIMATELY 4 FT TALL) TOLD HIM --IN FLUENT FRENCH- </p><p>- EARTHLINGS HAD BEEN CREATED IN A LABORATORY 25,000 YEARS </p><p>AGO. SINCE THESE ALIENS WHICH HE CALLS THE ELOHIM (THE </p><p>HEBREW WORD FOR GOD) ARE 25,000 YEARS AHEAD OF US, RAEL SAYS </p><p>CLONING IS VERY SIMPLE TASK FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3. ALTHOUGH THE SECT IS BASED IN MONTREAL--AND NOT </p><p>SWITZERLAND AS THE BRITISH TABLOID PRESS HAS REPORTED --RAEL </p><p>MOVED HIS PERSONAL HEADQUARTERS TO FLORIDA IN THE EARLY </p><p>NINETIES. WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED RAEL WAS MOVING TO FLORIDA, </p><p>RADIO COMMENTATORS JOKED HE WAS SIMPLY IMITATING QUEBEC </p><p>SNOWBIRDS OR THAT HE WANTED TO GET CLOSER TO NASCAR </p><p>CIRCUITS. HOWEVER, SOME SAW U.S. EXPANSION AS A LOGICAL </p><p>BUSINESS MOVE. ON THE ONE HAND, SINCE THE 1960S, QUEBEC HAS </p><p>PROVEN TO BE TOUGH RECRUITING GROUNDS FOR ALL RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUPS, MAINSTREAM OR OTHERWISE. ON THE OTHER, THE U.S. </p><p>OFFERS MUCH BIGGER POOLS OF MONEY AND TARGET AUDIENCES FOR </p><p>RAELIAN COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. BECAUSE THE GROUP IS </p><p>RECOGNIZED AS AN ATHEIST RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION BY THE </p><p>QUEBEC GOVERNMENT IT ENJOYS THE SAME FISCAL ADVANTAGES AS </p><p>OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GROUP OPERATES A THEME PARK CALLED UFO LAND IN </p><p>QUEBEC\'S EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AREA. THE FACILITY, WHICH </p><p>CONSISTS MAINLY OF A LARGE FLYING SAUCER, A LARGE-SCALE DNA </p><p>MOLECULE AND SOME ROOMS FOR SUMMER SEMINARS AND MEDIA </p><p>INTERVIEWS, WAS RECENTLY VANDALIZED BUT IS SCHEDULED TO </p><p>REOPEN THIS SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN PHOTOS AND TELEVISION APPEARANCES, RAEL SURROUNDS </p><p>HIMSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. RAELIAN MEDIA KITS INCLUDE </p><p>MANY PICTURES OF SCANTILY DRESSED "MEMBERS." RAEL PREACHES </p><p>"SENSUAL MEDITATION" WHICH ENABLES THE FAITHFUL TO REACH THE </p><p>"COSMIC ORGASM." </p><p> </p><p>6. DESPITE THE SECT\'S TWO POWERFUL MARKETING TOOLS, SEX AND </p><p>UFOS, THE RAELIANS HAVE VERY FEW MEMBERS.   THEIR WEB SITE </p><p>WWW.RAEL.ORG CLAIMS -IN TWENTY LANGUAGES-- TO HAVE 55,000 </p><p>MEMBERS IN 84 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER MIKE KROPVELD, EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE MONTREAL-BASED INFO-SECTE (NO RELATION WITH </p><p>THE PARIS ORGANIZATION OF THE SAME NAME) TOLD POST THAT THE </p><p>RAELIANS INFLATE THEIR FIGURES WITH PAST AND OCCASIONAL </p><p>MEMBERS. BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEDIA ATTENTION, THE GROUP </p><p>CREATES A LOT OF CURIOSITY -A RAEL SPOKESMAN STATED IN THE </p><p>LOCAL PRESS ON DECEMBER 30 THAT THE WEBSITE WAS GETTING ONE </p><p>MILLION HITS PER HOUR ON DECEMBER 26 -- BUT MOST VISITORS </p><p>ONLY ATTEND A FEW MEETINGS. THE ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IS BETWEEN </p><p>2,000 AND 3,000 WORLDWIDE AND ABOUT 700 IN MONTREAL, SAYS </p><p>KROPVELD. </p><p> </p><p>7. ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEWS ANALYSTS, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF </p><p>RAELIANS IS TO CREATE LIFE IN A LABORATORY WHICH WOULD MAKE </p><p>HUMAN BEINGS IMMORTAL AND ENABLE THEM TO CREATE ANOTHER </p><p>CIVILIZATION ON ANOTHER PLANET. IN THE MEANTIME, RAEL WANTS </p><p>TO BUILD AN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL TO WELCOME THE ELOHIM WHEN </p><p>THEY COME BACK IN 2035. THE GROUP HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICIZED </p><p>FOR ADVOCATING THE USE OF GENETICS FOR EUGENIC ATTEMPTS AT </p><p>IMPROVING THE HUMAN RACE. THE GROUP\'S STRUCTURE WITH PRIESTS </p><p>AND BISHOPS IS BASED ALONG THE LINES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>8. UNTIL RECENTLY THE GROUP AVOIDED SERIOUS CONTROVERSY. </p><p>THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY STORIES OF FORMER MEMBERS </p><p>COMPLAINING ABOUT BEING CONNED OUT OF THEIR MONEY OR </p><p>PHYSICALLY ABUSED OR SEDUCED, AND NO INVOLVEMENT WITH MINORS </p><p>-- EXCEPT ONE CASE IN FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  NONETHELESS, THE RAELIANS KNOW HOW TO PIGGYBACK ON </p><p>STORIES TO GET PUBLICITY. WHEN IN 1993, AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>QUEBEC DECIDED AGAINST INSTALLING CONDOM DISTRIBUTORS IN </p><p>SCHOOLS, RAELIANS VISITED THE KIDS WITH FREE SAMPLES. IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE RECENT PEDOPHILE CHARGES AGAINST VARIOUS </p><p>RELIGIOUS ORDERS, THE GROUP WENT BACK TO THE SCHOOLS IN </p><p>QUEBEC. THEIR PLAN THIS TIME WAS TO HAND OUT SMALL WOODEN </p><p>CROSSES FOR THE STUDENTS TO BURN. BUT PUBLIC AND </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL OPPOSITION STOPPED THE LATER PROJECT. IN BOTH </p><p>CASES, ALMOST ALL THE PUBLICITY THEY GARNERED WAS BAD. </p><p> </p><p>10. SENSING A SIMILAR WAVE OF CONDEMNATION, RAEL HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM DR. BOISSELIER, A RAELIAN </p><p>BISHOP, AND HER CLONING WORK, SAYING HE HAD GOTTEN RID OF </p><p>CLONAID TWO YEARS AGO. HOWEVER, KROPVELD BELIEVES THAT </p><p>CLONING IS BY FAR THE GROUP\'S MOST DANGEROUS WORK. KROPFELD </p><p>EVEN DOUBTS RAEL REALLY BELIEVES IN CLONING HUMAN BEINGS </p><p>BEYOND ITS MARKETING POSSIBILITIES FOR HIMSELF AS SECT </p><p>LEADER. </p><p> </p><p>11. AS FOR DR BRIGITTE BOISSELIER, SHE WAS BORN IN 1956 IN </p><p>FRANCE. SHE HOLDS TWO PHDS IN CHEMISTRY, ONE FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF DIJON IN FRANCE AND ONE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>HOUSTON. AFTER HOUSTON SHE WAS HIRED BY AIR LIQUIDE THE </p><p>FRENCH INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL GAS MULTINATIONAL TO WORK ON </p><p>REVERSIBLE OXYGEN BINDING. IN 1989, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTED HER </p><p>TO VP RESEARCH. </p><p> </p><p>12. PRIOR TO JOINING CLONAID (SEE WWW.CLONAID.COM) IN 1997, </p><p>DR. BOISSELIER HAD NOT WORKED IN BIOLOGY OR REPRODUCTION </p><p>TECHNIQUES. THE LAS VEGAS-BASED CLONAID RECEIVED $500,000 </p><p>FROM MARK HUNT TO BUILD A LABORATORY IN WEST VIRGINIA BEFORE </p><p>MR. HUNT DECIDED TO STOP FINANCING THAT PROJECT. CLONAID </p><p>ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE RECEIVED $200,000 FROM 250 DIFFERENT </p><p>DONORS IN THE HOPE OF CLONING A FAMILY MEMBER. ON MARCH 28, </p><p>2001 DR. BOISSELIER AND RAEL DEFENDED THEIR CLONING PROJECTS </p><p>BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT. THE PUBLICITY GARNERED BY THE CLONING </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE USED BY THE RAEL ORGANIZATION TO GAIN </p><p>NEW ADHERENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>14.  CANADA LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>ADOPTING LEGISLATION BILL C-113 WHICH WOULD BAN HUMAN </p><p>CLONING. ONE LIKELY RESULT OF THE BOISSELIER ANNOUNCEMENT IS </p><p>THAT SUCH LEGISLATION COULD CONTAIN STRICTER RESTRICTIONS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>KANTER </p><p></p></div>
