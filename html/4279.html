SUMMARY: The mid-October accreditation of three </p><p>additional NGOs to serve as WFP implementing partners by the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe is a welcome step but will do little </p><p>to reduce the increasing levels of malnutrition in the </p><p>country.  Wasting among children under five was close to the </p><p>upper limit for non-drought Africa, and stunting was among </p><p>the highest in the world, according to a study published in </p><p>September.  Without a relaxation of grain import restictions, </p><p>clarification on the importation of additional </p><p>biotechnology-derived corn, and an infusion of corn into the </p><p>country, these additional implementing partners will be </p><p>insufficient for the fight against starvation.  (NOTE: This </p><p>is the first in a series of regular food security and </p><p>nutritional updates. END NOTE.) END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>New NGOs Struggle to Set Up </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. In October, the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) accredited </p><p>three more NGOs (GOAL, CONCERN, and Catholic Relief Services </p><p>(CRS)) to be WFP implementing partners. With the addition of </p><p>these NGOs, 49 districts out of 57 will be serviced.  These </p><p>new NGOs hope to be distributing food by the end of the year </p><p>but face great logistical challenges.  Save the Children-UK, </p><p>CARE International, World Vision, and Catholic Relief </p><p>Services will service most remaining districts through </p><p>bilateral arrangements.  The other WFP implementing partners </p><p>are World Vision, Plan International, Organization of Rural </p><p>Associations for Progress (ORAP), Lutheran World Federation </p><p>(LWF), Help Age, Christian Care, and CARE International. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Political Officer spoke with country director for </p><p>CONCERN, Mike McDonnagh about the recent accreditation. </p><p>CONCERN, an Irish NGO, will operate in Gokwe and Kwekwe in </p><p>Midlands province and Nyanga in Manicaland province.  They </p><p>will feed 570,000 people with 40,000 metric tons (MT) of food </p><p>over four months.  McDonnagh said he hoped to begin </p><p>distributing food by the end of November but was just </p><p>beginning beneficiary registration and hiring local staff. </p><p>CONCERN will need to purchase and install computers in the </p><p>field.  McDonnagh was optimistic about getting everything in </p><p>place, saying GOZ representatives had been very helpful since </p><p>CONCERN received accreditation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Political Officer spoke with a CRS representative, Greg </p><p>Bastion, who said CRS will distribute food to 291,628 people </p><p>in Chegutu, Makonde, and Kadoma districts in Mashonaland </p><p>West.  CRS is planning to distribute 4086 tons of food per </p><p>month.  Bastion said CRS was well positioned to increase </p><p>capacity because it was already working in country providing </p><p>supplementary and therapeutic feeding to patients in </p><p>hospices.  Bastion said CRS still needed at least six weeks </p><p>to get everything in place for a successful food </p><p>distribution.  CRS was in the process of hiring staff, </p><p>finding warehouses and office space, procuring vehicles, and </p><p>supplying the offices.  CRS was not as optimistic as CONCERN </p><p>about when actual food distributions will begin but would </p><p>only say that they would like them to begin before 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP public affairs officer, Luis Clemens, told us that in </p><p>spite of their best efforts, CONCERN and GOAL would not be up </p><p>and running by mid-November, although hopefully by the </p><p>beginning of December.  He also said GOAL, an Irish NGO, will </p><p>feed 392,000 beneficiaries in Hurungwe in Mashonaland West </p><p>province and Makoni in Manicaland province.  They will </p><p>distribute 27,405 MT of food aid between November 2002 and </p><p>March 2003.  GOAL has started fieldwork but has the same </p><p>logistical issues as CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP plans to increase food distributions to more than </p><p>50,000 metric tons per month between November 2002 and April </p><p>2003 and increase the beneficiary load to 5.9 million. </p><p>According to the UN Relief and Recovery Unit, as of October </p><p>15, the WFP had distributed a total of 53,047 MT of food to </p><p>1.05 million people since the end of February.  The addition </p><p>of CONCERN, CRS, and GOAL will increase WFP capacity by </p><p>20,000 MT per month and beneficiaries by 1.25 million. </p><p>COMMENT: Even if the WFP implementing partners succeed in </p><p>setting up their relief distribution operations, they may not </p><p>have the corn to distribute because of restrictive GOZ </p><p>policies on grain trade and biotechnology-derived foods.  See </p><p>Reftels C and D for a discussion of these supply constraints. </p><p>END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>7.  The WFP implementing partner and district breakdowns are </p><p>as follows: </p><p>--World Vision: Chiredzi, Gwanda, Matobo, Umguza, Bubi, </p><p>Lupane, Chikomba, Wedza, Seke, Marondera, Goromonzi, Murehwa, </p><p>Mutoko, Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe (UMP), Mudzi, Mt. Darwin </p><p>--Plan International: Mutare, Mutasa </p><p>--ORAP: Hwange, Tsholotsho, Umzingwane, Insiza </p><p>--LWF: Shurugwi </p><p>--Help Age: Nkayi </p><p>--Christian Care: Chipinge, Buhera, Kariba, Guruve, Zvimba, </p><p>Mazowe, Bindura, Muzarabani, Rushinga </p><p>--CARE: Zvishavane, Chivi, Mberengwa, Mwenezi, Masvingo, </p><p>Zaka, Bikita </p><p>--CONCERN: Kwekwe, Gokwe North, Gokwe South, Nyanga </p><p>--GOAL: Hurungwe, Makoni </p><p>--Catholic Relief Services: Chegutu, Kadoma, Makonde. </p><p> </p><p>Nutritional Status to Worsen </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>8.  In spite of the additional implementing partners, the </p><p>nutritional status of the population, in particular of </p><p>children, continues to worsen.  A September Zimbabwe </p><p>Emergency Food Security Assessment Report prepared by FEWSNET </p><p>and the Zimbabwe National and SADC FANR Vulnerability </p><p>Assessment Committee (VAC) showed a worsening nutritional </p><p>status when compared with previous studies.  (Direct </p><p>comparison between the various studies is not possible </p><p>because of different sampling methods, but the VAC results </p><p>affirm a deteriorating nutrition situation nationally.) </p><p>Approximately 7 percent of children aged 6 to 59 months </p><p>showed evidence of wasting or low weight for height </p><p>measurement.  Wasting reflects acute or recent nutritional </p><p>deficits and at its most severe is linked to increased </p><p>mortality risk.  Wasting prevalences of 5 to 10 percent are </p><p>usual in African populations in non-drought periods.  More </p><p>than 41 percent of children sampled were stunted, low height </p><p>for age.  Stunting reflects the cumulative effect of chronic </p><p>malnutrition.  Stunting prevalence ranges from 32 percent in </p><p>developing countries to 43 percent in the least developed </p><p>countries, according to UNICEF.  Wasting was highest among </p><p>children aged 6 to 11 months (9.7 percent) while stunting was </p><p>highest among the 12-23 month olds (49.1 percent). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Interviews by embassy political officers during field </p><p>trips to rural areas during rural council elections and the </p><p>Ambassador,s Midlands province trip highlight the growing </p><p>concern child nutrition has become for the general population. </p><p>--Manicaland: A German physician who runs a clinic where she </p><p>treats victims of violence noted that malnutrition levels </p><p>among children were up compared to last year.  She also said </p><p>she had not seen the distended bellies but had noticed signs </p><p>of wasting, kwashiorkor, redness and loss of hair, and </p><p>scaling skin. </p><p>--Matebeleland: Political Officers visited St. Luke,s </p><p>Mission Hospital about 100 km north of the city of Bulawayo. </p><p>The resident German doctor said he had witnessed a dramatic </p><p>rise in the numbers of adults and children affected by </p><p>malnutrition in the last two months.  In the hospital ward </p><p>set aside for malnutrition cases, all the toddlers suffered </p><p>from wasting and several were suffering from skin lesions and </p><p>kwashiorkor, and at least one had reddish hair.  The doctor </p><p>said he expected all of the children in the malnutrition ward </p><p>to either die from HIV/AIDS, which afflicted 80-90 percent of </p><p>the hospital,s patients, or malnutrition (See Reftel A). </p><p>--Midlands: Chief Cyprian Malisa of Silobela in Midlands </p><p>province told political officer that one child had already </p><p>died in one of his areas of jurisdiction and three other </p><p>children looked to be near death.  (See Reftel B) </p><p>--In addition, the independent newspaper The Daily News </p><p>reported on October 16 that two people in Binga had died </p><p>recently of starvation, and that school children were </p><p>fainting at their desks from hunger. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10.  COMMENT: It is unlikely that WFP and its implementing </p><p>partners will be able to stave off widespread malnutrition </p><p>despite their best efforts.  GOZ recalcitrance in admitting </p><p>there would be food shortages,  accrediting NGOs to help in </p><p>food aid distribution, and allowing free trade of grain has </p><p>made a successful response to the crisis unlikely.  The </p><p>nutritional level of children in Zimbabwe has undoubtedly </p><p>worsened over the last 3-4 months, since the completion of </p><p>the VAC survey, and may be approaching critical levels.  The </p><p>VAC, as well as individual NGOs, plans to conduct regular </p><p>nutritional surveys and to monitor the status of children. </p><p>Per Reftel D, USAID/OFDA is also exploring possible USG </p><p>support for establishing a national nutrtional sentinel </p><p>surveillance system for Zimbabwe.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
