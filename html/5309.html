<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PREF, PHUM, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: PAVING THE WAY FOR US-TURKEY-KURD </p><p>TRILATS (II) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 18029 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 539 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 283 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 278 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 b </p><p>and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See Para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) TGS DCHOD Buyukanit told Ambassador Jan. 24 that the </p><p>MFA had reported to him that the US in Ref B discussion with </p><p>MFA U/S Ziyal said it did not want 5-way talks.  Ambassador </p><p>told Buyukanit that was not true, that he had told Ziyal he </p><p>needed to ask Washington for instructions, and that it was </p><p>Turkey that told us it only wanted US-Turkey bilats and we </p><p>had been proceeding on that basis until the Ref B </p><p>conversation.  Ambassador emphasized that we told MFA we were </p><p>ready for talks.  Buyukanit indicated that now was better </p><p>than later and that he would be discussing this with the MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) KDP and PUK Ankara reps Safeen Dizayee and Bahros </p><p>Galali told ONW POLAD Jan. 24 they had heard from their </p><p>respective headquarters about the idea and were instructed to </p><p>tell the MFA they were prepared to enter "US-Turkey-Iraqi </p><p>Kurd" talks.  KDP rep Dizayee told us a TGS rep subsequently </p><p>called on him to say if Barzani and Talabani participated, </p><p>Iraqi Turkmen Front Chairman Sanan Aga must participate as </p><p>well.  Dizayee said he passed that message back to Barzani, </p><p>who replied that ITF participation was not acceptable, as </p><p>this discussion was not about the Turkmen.  Dizayee added </p><p>that the KDP did not want to "confuse these meetings with the </p><p>Ankara Process (which included the ITF as observers), as that </p><p>process had been superceded by the Washington Agreement and </p><p>overcome by events.  The KDP did not want to create the </p><p>impression that there were problems between the KDP and the </p><p>PUK," which was what the Ankara Process was designed to </p><p>resolve. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Action Request and Recommendation:  We propose the </p><p>Department send us points for the Ambassador\'s use soonest to </p><p>open subject bilats with Turkey.  We also suggest that Amb. </p><p>Khalilzad open subject talks ASAP either via STU III or </p><p>face-to-face in Washington or some other location before his </p><p>upcoming travel with the KDP and the PUK.  We believe we need </p><p>to use these bilats to prepare the way for multi-party </p><p>face-to-face talks when Amb. Khalilzad is here in early </p><p>February and to sort out the issue of ITF participation.  To </p><p>insist on ITF participation risks losing the KDP from the </p><p>process.  To reject it risks losing the Turks.  We need to </p><p>use the bilats to finesse this issue, possibly by including </p><p>the ITF as observers, as was done in the Ankara Process, </p><p>while making clear that this is not/not a continuation of </p><p>that process.  End Action Request and Recommendation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
