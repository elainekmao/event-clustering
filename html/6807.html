O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Business Leaders Push Envelope - Gently </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 531 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Zimbabwean business leaders told us </p><p>they are increasingly willing to assert themselves with </p><p>GOZ ministers. Still, they acknowledge that their </p><p>outspokenness has its limits and carries some risks. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Modest Break-Through? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador Sullivan hosted a roundtable </p><p>discussion on March 25 for five prominent company chiefs: </p><p>Dairiboard\'s Anthony Mandiwanza, Cottco\'s Sylvester </p><p>Nguni, International Capital Corporation\'s Bernard </p><p>Chidzero, Intermarket\'s Nicholas Vingirai and PG </p><p>Industries\' Gerald Mujaji.  The businessmen feel the GOZ </p><p>has finally begun to entertain their input, citing recent </p><p>talks with the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries </p><p>(CZI), which Mandiwanza heads, as well as the </p><p>government/industry/labor Tripartite Negotiating Forum </p><p>(TNF).  These negotiations helped bring about devaluation </p><p>and could lead to a relaxation in price controls. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nonetheless, dialogue with the GOZ still has its </p><p>challenges.  Mandiwanza agreed the GOZ should scrap price </p><p>controls, but could not make that case in blunt terms to </p><p>the ultra-sensitive government ministers.  Instead, he </p><p>redefined controls as "managed" prices, satisfying the </p><p>government\'s interventionist zeal and the private </p><p>sector\'s need for higher prices. Mandiwanza employed the </p><p>same strategy in gaining a devaluation, labeling it an </p><p>"export support mechanism."  He was less successful in </p><p>arguing for liberalized fuel prices and import licenses, </p><p>as inflation fears cut the proposed price increase by two- </p><p>thirds.  In these and any other matters of economic </p><p>policy, roundtable participants agreed that even moderate </p><p>government officials have a very steep learning curve. </p><p>Businesses are more accustomed to getting their way </p><p>through quiet, tactical bribes.  Conversely, our </p><p>interlocutors still fear for themselves and their </p><p>families if they stick their necks out too far, ensuring </p><p>the government/business relationship remains uneasy. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) As we have reported (ref), the GOZ has </p><p>successfully implemented devaluation and higher fuel </p><p>prices.  These are arguably the first positive </p><p>macroeconomic developments in over a year, and ones that </p><p>several roundtable participants had a hand in.  If the </p><p>GOZ wants to turn around this economy, however, it\'s </p><p>still just in the first inning.  Further reforms will fan </p><p>popular discontent, possibly triggering an escalation in </p><p>GOZ repression. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The businessmen want desperately to approach </p><p>economics in isolation from politics, maintaining the </p><p>kind of neutral, nonpartisan posture that a corporation </p><p>might in the U.S.  Most businesses bent over backwards to </p><p>avoid any appearance of supporting the opposition\'s </p><p>stayaway on March 19-20, although most avoided opposing </p><p>it either.  At a time when the public-private sector </p><p>dialogue is advancing, neutrality has both appeal and </p><p>merit.  Ultimately, though, we do not believe anyone here </p><p>in government, business or civil society can disentangle </p><p>economic growth and stability from political legitimacy, </p><p>human rights and rule-of-law -- economic-political </p><p>linkage that both the African Growth and Opportunity Act </p><p>(AGOA) and New Partnership for Africa\'s Development </p><p>(NEPAD) underscore.  Participants at the lunch -- the </p><p>elite of indigenous businessmen -- are increasingly </p><p>cognizant of the linkages and the need for Zimbabwe to </p><p>reengage internationally with its traditional economic </p><p>partners.  PG\'s Mujaji said his participation at this </p><p>moment in an American Embassy lunch was intended and will </p><p>be read as a signal by the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) At the lunch, we underlined problems with GOZ </p><p>governance and lack of respect for human and civil </p><p>rights.  We praised the businessmen for their success in </p><p>achieving several positive economic steps, but observed </p><p>that the economic crisis could not solved without also </p><p>addressing Zimbabwe\'s political crisis, in which at least </p><p>half the population is alienated from the Government. </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
