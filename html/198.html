<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 17 HARARE 01365 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PINR, KPRP, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE NEW GOZ:  BIO INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) HARARE 17 B) HARARE 394 C) 87 HARARE 6985 D) HARARE 240 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY </p><p>2, 1988 THE COMPOSITION OF HIS NEW CABINET (REF A). </p><p>THIS NEW GOVERNMENT CONSISTS OF THREE SENIOR MINISTERS, </p><p>21 CABINET MINISTERS, 3 CABINET-RANK MINISTERS OF STATE, </p><p>15 DEPUTY MINISTERS, 5 MINISTERS OF STATE WHO WORK AS </p><p>"PARTY APPOINTEES", AND 3 DEPUTY MINISTERS OF STATE WHO </p><p>ASSIST THE "PARTY APPOINTEES". </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AMONG THESE VARIED GROUPS, THERE ARE 14 ZERURU, </p><p>12 KARANGA, 11 MANYIKA, 8 NDEBELE, 3 WHITES, 2 </p><p>COLOUREDS, AND AN ASIAN (REF B).  SIX OF THESE 51 </p><p>APPOINTEES ARE WOMEN.  WHILE SOME MINISTERS FROM THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE RETAINED THEIR PORTFOLIOS, </p><p>OTHER VETERAN MINISTERS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO NEW </p><p>ASSIGNMENTS.  SEVERAL PROMINENT PERSONALITIES HAVE ALSO </p><p>BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CABINET AND THERE ARE, OF COURSE, </p><p>SOME NEW FACES.  PROVIDED BELOW ARE BIO SKETCHES FOR ALL </p><p>THE MEMBERS OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT.  OTHER APPOINTMENTS, </p><p>SUCH AS PERMANENT SECRETARIES AND AMBASSADORS, ARE STILL </p><p>TO BE ANNOUNCED.  THE BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION PROVIDED IN </p><p>THIS REPORT IS THE BEST OVERALL DATA WHICH HAVE HAVE </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO ASSEMBLE SINCE THE FORMATION OF THE NEW </p><p>GOZ.  WE WELCOME COMMENTS AND ADDITIONS AS WELL AS </p><p>QUERIES FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF THIS GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3. (U) SIMON VENGESAI MUZENDA:  IS A VETERAN NATIONALIST </p><p>AND LONG-TIME MUGABE CONFIDANT AND LOYALIST.  IN THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HE SERVED AS THE DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, A POSITION HE HAS HELD CONTINUOUSLY SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  MUZENDA IS ZANU\'S SECOND SECRETARY AND </p><p>MEMBER OF THE POLITBURO.  IN ADDITION TO BEING NAMED </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IN 1980, MUZENDA ALSO SERVED UNTIL </p><p>JANUARY 1981 AS MUGABE\'S FIRST FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p>MUZENDA WAS BORN IN 1922.  HE IS MARRIED AND HAD EIGHT </p><p>CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS KILLED DURING THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MUZENDA IS FROM THE KARANGA TRIBE AND IS THE </p><p>LEADER OF ONE OF THE POLITICAL FACTIONS WHICH NOW </p><p>DIVIDES THAT GROUP.  IT IS SAID THAT MUZENDA MAY ACTUALLY </p><p>BE A MEMBER OF THE TINY VENDA TRIBE, A NON-SHONA GROUP </p><p>FROM SOUTHERN ZIMBABWE WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE KARANGA.  UNLIKE OTHER KARANGAS, </p><p>MUZENDA AND HIS FACTION (AS MUGABE LOYALISTS) ARE NOT </p><p>CHALLENGING THE ZEZURU POLITICAL ASCENDENCY.  IT IS </p><p>SAID THAT THERE IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN MUZENDA AND </p><p>JOSHUA NKOMO, AND BETWEEN MUZENDA AND FELLOW KARANGA </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO.  THE ANIMOSITY BETWEEN MUZENDA AND NKOMO </p><p>WAS REPORTEDLY EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT BOTH </p><p>MUZENDA AND NKOMO EXPECTED TO BE NAMED VICE PRESIDENT. </p><p>MUGABE, IT IS RUMORED, MADE MATTERS WORSE BY DELAYING </p><p>HIS DECISION ON WHICH MAN TO TAP FOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY </p><p>UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT.  DESPITE HIS BEING VICE PRESIDENT, </p><p>MUZENDA IS NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE THE LIKELY </p><p>PERMANENT SUCCESSOR TO MUGABE SHOULD THE LATTER LEAVE </p><p>OR BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, THOUGH HE WOULD LIKELY BE </p><p>THE INTERIM LEADER DUE TO HIS NUMBER TWO POSITIONS IN </p><p>BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>SENIOR MINISTERS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>5. (U) MAURICE NYAGUMBO:  REMAINS IN CHARGE OF POLITICAL </p><p>AFFAIRS IN THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  HE SERVED IN THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>POLITICAL AFFAIRS AND CO-ORDINATION OF COOPERATIVES, </p><p>ATTACHED TO THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE.  NYAGUMBO IS </p><p>ONE OF THE TOP FIVE ZANU PARTY OFFICIALS, IS IN THE </p><p>POLITBURO, AND SERVES AS THE PARTY\'S SECRETARY FOR </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  SINCE INDEPENDENCE, NYAGUMBO SERVED AS </p><p>THE MINISTER OF MINES AND ENERGY RESOURCES UNTIL JANUARY </p><p>1984 WHEN HE BECAME A MINISTER OF STATE.  NYAGUMBO WAS </p><p>BORN IN 1924.  HE IS MARRIED AND HAS SIX CHILDREN. </p><p>NYAGUMBO TRAVELED TO THE US IN 1987 ON A USIA IV GRANT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) NYAGUMBO IS ANOTHER LONG-TIME MUGABE ASSOCIATE </p><p>AND WAS HELD IN DETENTION WITH MUGABE UNTIL HIS RELEASE </p><p>IN 1975.  WHILE IN PRISON, NYAGUMBO SUPPORTED MUGABE\'S </p><p>BID TO TAKE OVER THE LEADERSHIP OF ZANU FROM NDABANINGI </p><p>SITHOLE.  NYAGUMBO IS A MANYIKA--THE LEADER OF A MANYIKA </p><p>FACTION WHICH IS LOYAL TO MUGABE--AND OPPOSES THE MANYIKA </p><p>FACTION LED BY EDGAR TEKERE.  LIKE THE KARANGA, THE </p><p>MANYIKA ARE DIVIDED BY VARIOUS INTERNAL FACTIONS AND </p><p>LACK A SINGLE COMMANDING LEADER.  UNLIKE THE KARANGA, </p><p>THE MANYIKA HAVE HISTORICALLY ALLIED THEMSELVES WITH </p><p>THE ZEZURU.  NYAGUMBO IS NOW WELL POSITIONED TO BE A </p><p>STRONG CONTENDER FOR EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDING MUGABE AS </p><p>PRESIDENT, BUT HE HAS NOT IMPRESSED MANY PEOPLE WITH </p><p>HIS ADMINISTRATION OR LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) BERNARD CHIDZERO IS NOW THE SENIOR MINISTER OF </p><p>FINANCE, ECONOMIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. HE HAS </p><p>SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES </p><p>OF INDUSTRY, TRADE AND COMMERCE, LAND AND AGRICULTURE, </p><p>AND MINES.  HE ALSO SERVES AS HIS OWN FINANCE MINISTER, </p><p>THE POSITION HE HELD IN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT. </p><p>CHIDZERO RECIEVED HIS HIGHER EDUCATION IN CANADA, </p><p>EARNING AN M.A. AT OTTAWA UNIVERSITY IN 1955, AND A </p><p>PH.D. AT MCGILL UNIVERSITY (MONTREAL) IN 1958.  HE DID </p><p>POST-GRADUATE STUDIES IN OXFORD.  BEFORE ENTERING </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN 1980 AS MINISTER OF ECONOMIC PLANNING AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, CHIDZERO HELD SEVERAL POSITIONS IN THE U.N. </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, THE LAST BEING AS DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>COMMODITIES DIVISION OF UNCTAD.  CHIDZERO WAS BORN IN </p><p>1927.  HE CONVERTED TO ROMAN CATHOLICISM AS A YOUNG </p><p>MAN.  HE IS MARRIED TO A CANADIAN AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CHIDZERO, THE SON OF A ZEZURU MOTHER AND A </p><p>MALAWIAN FATHER, WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE HARARE AREA. </p><p>HE WAS OVERSEAS DURING MOST OF THE NATIONALIST STRUGGLE </p><p>AND THUS LACKS THE POLITICAL BASE AND LIBERATION </p><p>CREDENTIALS TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN A WELL RESPECTED </p><p>TECHNOCRAT.  HE IS WIDELY RESPECTED IN THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR HERE AND IN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. </p><p>HE CLEARLY FAVORS MOST OF THE ECONOMIC REFORMS AND </p><p>GROWTH STRATEGIES WHICH THE WORLD BANK RECOMMENDS FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  HE ALSO FAVORS THE EXECUTION OF AN OPIC </p><p>AGREEMENT.  DISAPPOINTINGLY, HE WILL NOT FORCEFULLY </p><p>ARGUE FOR SUCH ECONOMIC CHANGES IN CABINET IF HE SENSES </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS ANY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) JOSHUA NKOMO, A VETERAN NATIONALIST AND PRESIDENT </p><p>OF ZAPU, IS NOW BACK IN GOVERNMENT AS THE SENIOR </p><p>MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND RURAL AND URBAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, WITH ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR </p><p>COMMUNITY AND CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT, WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS, </p><p>AND NATIONAL HOUSING.  NKOMO, WHO TURNED DOWN MUGABE\'S </p><p>OFFER TO MAKE HIM THE PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE AFTER </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, FIRST SERVED IN THE GOVERNMENT AS THE </p><p>MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS FROM MARCH 1980 TO JANUARY </p><p>1981, WHEN HE WAS SHIFTED TO MINISTRY OF PUBLIC </p><p>SERVICE.  IN THE LATTER POSITION, NKOMO WAS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR RESTRUCTURING THE WHITE-DOMINATED CIVIL SERVICE. </p><p>NKOMO\'S REASSIGNMENT WAS SEEN BY SOME AS A DEMOTION AND </p><p>AN ATTEMPT BY THE RULING ZANU CLIQUE TO EXCLUDE ZAPU </p><p>MEMBERS FROM MINISTRIES DEALING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>MATTERS.  NKOMO WAS MADE MINISTER WITHOUT PORFOLIO, AND </p><p>WAS FINALLY DISMISSED FROM THE CABINET ALONG WITH OTHER </p><p>ZAPU MINISTERS IN FEBRUARY 1982.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, </p><p>NKOMO WENT INTO EXILE IN THE UK BUT RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>AFTER A FEW MONTHS.  SINCE THEN, NKOMO WORKED </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY ON ZAPU BUSINESS AND ENTERED A SERIES OF </p><p>DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MUGAGE FOR THE UNIFICATION </p><p>OF ZANU AND ZAPU.  THESE NEGOTIATIONS CONCLUDED AT THE </p><p>END OF 1987, AND THE "UNITY AGREEMENT" WAS SIGNED ON </p><p>DECEMBER 22 (REF C).  NKOMO WAS BORN IN 1917.  HE BEGAN </p><p>HIS POLITICAL CAREER AS A TRADE UNIONIST WITH THE </p><p>RAILWAY WORKERS.  HE IS MARRIED AND HAS THREE GROWN </p><p>CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THERE HAD BEEN RUMORS THAT NKOMO EXPECTED TO BE </p><p>APPOINTED TO THE VICE PRESIDENCY WHEN MUGABE WAS </p><p>INAUGURATED AS THE NEW EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT ON </p><p>DECEMBER 30, 1987.  MUGABE, HOWEVER, APPOINTED FORMER </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND ZANU SECOND SECRETARY SIMON </p><p>MUZENDA AS THE NEW VICE PRESIDENT, MUCH TO NKOMO\'S </p><p>CHAGRIN.  IT IS EXPECTED, HOWEVER, THAT NKOMO AND </p><p>MUZENDA WILL HAVE EQUIVALENT POSITIONS, SUBORDINATE TO </p><p>MUGABE, IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE UNIFIED ZANU/ZAPU PARTY </p><p>ALTHOUGH SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT NKOMO WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY EMERGE THE STRONGER.  AS THE SENIOR MINISTER </p><p>IN CHARGE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>NKOMO SHOULD BE IN A POSITION TO CHANNEL MUCH NEEDED </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND ASSISTANCE INTO MATABELELAND </p><p>(NKOMO\'S HOME TURF) WHICH HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY NEGLECTED </p><p>IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENTAL ASSISTANCE AND BLIGHTED BY </p><p>DROUGHT AND BANDITRY.  NKOMO\'S PRIORITIES ARE TO END </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT AND VIOLENCE IN MATABELELAND, AND HE </p><p>RECENTLY ADJURED THE BANDITS/DISSIDENTS THERE TO LAY </p><p>DOWN THEIR WEAPONS.  NKOMO HAS ALSO PUT HIS PERSONAL </p><p>PRESTIGE BEHIND THE UNITY OF ZAPU AND ZANU AND IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT HE CONTINUES TO BE POPULAR AMONG THE </p><p>NDEBELE.  NKOMO, HIMSELF, IS FROM THE KALANGA TRIBE </p><p>WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY MADE UP OF SHONA-SPEAKING PERSONS </p><p>ABSORBED BY THE NDEBELE AT THE TIME OF THE LATTER\'S </p><p>OCCUPATION OF SOUTHWESTERN ZIMBABWE IN THE LAST </p><p>CENTURY.  THE KALANGA ARE NOW IDENTIFIED WITH THE </p><p>NDEBELE.  NKOMO IS ONE OF SEVERAL PROMINENT ZAPU </p><p>LEADERS WHO, THOUGH ASSUMED TO BE NDEBELE, IS ACTUALLY </p><p>PART OF THE KALANGA SUBGROUP.  THERE IS NOT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE SAME AMOUNT OF TRIBAL RIVALRY BETWEEN THE KALANGA </p><p>AND THE NDEBELE AS THERE IS AMONG THE VARIOUS </p><p>SHONA-SPEAKING SUBGROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>CABINET MINISTERS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>11. (U) MUGABE NAMED 21 CABINET MINISTERS (UP FROM 18 </p><p>MINISTERS IN THE PREVIOUS CABINET).  THESE MINISTERS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA </p><p>-- SHAMUYARIRA IS NEW TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND TAKES </p><p>OVER THIS PORTFOLIO FROM WITNESS MANGWENDE.  A </p><p>JOURNALIST BY TRAINING, HE SERVED AS THE MINISTER OF </p><p>INFORMATION SINCE 1980.  SHAMUYARIRA IS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>ZANU POLITBURO AND IS THE PARTY\'S SECRETARY FOR </p><p>PUBLICITY AND INFORMATION.  HE JOINED ZAPU IN 1962, BUT </p><p>LEFT IN 1963 TO HELP FOUND ZANU.  IN 1964, SHAMUYARIRA </p><p>LEFT TO STUDY POLITICAL SCIENCE AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, </p><p>AND RECEIVED A BA IN 1967.  HE SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK A </p><p>POSITION AS A LECTURER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES </p><p>SALAAM.  SHAMUYARIRA WAS APPOINTED ZANU\'S SECRETARY FOR </p><p>EXTERNAL AFFAIRS IN 1968.  HE LEFT ZANU IN 1971 TO HELP </p><p>FOUND FROLIZI, BUT LEFT FROLIZI TO RETURN TO THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF DAR IN 1973.  HE REJOINED ZANU IN 1977 AND </p><p>WENT TO MOZAMBIQUE AS THE DIRECTOR OF ZANU\'S EDUCATION </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  HE LATER SERVED AS THE PARTY\'S </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY.  SHAMUYARIRA IS THE AUTHOR OF </p><p>THE BOOK "CRISIS IN RHODESIA" (ANDRE DEUTSCH, 1965).  HE </p><p>IS MARRIED AND HAS A DAUGHTER. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) SHAMUYARIRA IS A ZEZURU BUT HAS NO PERSONAL </p><p>POLITICAL CONSTITUENCY.  HE IS ESSENTIALLY A TECHNOCRAT </p><p>RATHER THAN A POLITICIAN, AND IS DEPENDENT ON MUGABE\'S </p><p>FAVOR FOR HIS POSITION.  AS THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION, </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA DISPLAYED A TENDENCY TOWARD DOCTRINAIRE </p><p>SOCIALISM AND HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>HOWEVER, MANY OBSERVERS DESCRIBE HIM AS MORE OF AN </p><p>OPPORTUNIST THAN A COMMITTED IDEOLOGUE.  IN THE TWO </p><p>MONTHS THAT SHAMUYARIRA HAS BEEN FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>HE HAS BEEN REASONABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND CERTAINLY </p><p>HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT OVER HIS PREDECESSOR, WITNESS </p><p>MANGWENDE.  A SOURCE TELLS US THAT SHAMUYARIRA, ALONG </p><p>WITH ANOTHER ZEZURU MINISTER, SIDNEY SEKERAMAYI, WERE </p><p>THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND BLOCKING THE APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, A KARANGA, TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>DEFENSE.  SHAMUYARIRA IS REPORTEDLY ONE OF THE LEADERS </p><p>IN THE "GROUP OF 26" WHICH SEEKS TO MAINTAIN AND </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE ZEZURU ASCENDENCY ON THE GOZ. </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA ALSO REPORTEDLY RESISTED THE ZAPU/ZANU </p><p>UNITY ACCORD.  HE IS ALSO WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE VERY </p><p>CLOSE TO THE SOVIETS, THOUGH FOR OPPORTUNISTIC AND </p><p>PRAGMATIC, RATHER THAN IDEOLOGICAL REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) MINISTER OF INFORMATION, POSTS, AND </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (IPT) WITNESS MANGWENDE: </p><p>-- MANGWENDE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS SINCE 1981.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INDEPENDENCE </p><p>N 1980, MANGWENDE SERVED AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER.  MANGWENDE STUDIED AT THE </p><p>LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS DURING THE YEARS OF THE </p><p>NATIONALIST STRUGGLE, AND SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>ZANU\'S ZIMBABWE STUDENTS\' UNION.  IN 1979 HE WAS </p><p>APPOINTED CHIEF ZANU REPRESENTATIVE TO MOZAMBIQUE. </p><p>MANGWENDE WAS BORN IN 1946, IS MARRIED, AND HAS NO </p><p>CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) WHILE MANGWENDE DOES NOT HAVE A PERSONAL </p><p>POLITICAL CONSTITUENCY, HE REMAINS IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS MEMBERSHIP IN A PROMINENT ZEZURU CLAN. </p><p>MANGWENDE THEREFORE CAN BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>POLITICAL STATUS QUO WHICH FAVORS THE ZEZURU ASCENDENCY. </p><p>HE WAS NOT FAVORABLY REVIEWED AS A FOREIGN MINISTER BY </p><p>THE LOCAL DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY.  MANGWENDE WAS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO REACH, DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH, AND HAS </p><p>A DRINKING PROBLEM.  HIS LACK OF DIPLOMATIC SKILLS </p><p>AND COMPLETE ESPOUSAL OF THIRD WORLD, ANTI-US RHETORIC, </p><p>GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DETERIORATION OF US-ZIMBABWE </p><p>RELATIONS IN THE 1983-86 PERIOD.  SINCE BECOMING </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTER, MANGWENDE HAS BEEN FEATURED </p><p>PROMINENTLY ON RADIO AND TELEVISION, HAS CRITICIZED </p><p>THE IMPORTING OF FOREIGN TELEVISION PROGRAMS, AND HAS </p><p>CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL TELEVISION </p><p>PRODUCTION INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) MINISTER OF DEFENSE:  ENOS NKALA </p><p>-- NKALA IS NEW TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, TAKING OVER </p><p>THIS PORTFOLIO FROM MUGABE WHO, SINCE INDEPENDENCE, HAD </p><p>SERVED AS HIS OWN DEFENSE MINISTER.  NKALA JOINED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS THE MINISTER OF FINANCE IN 1980, AND THEN </p><p>BECAME THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS IN JULY 1985.  HE IS </p><p>A MEMBER OF THE ZANU POLITBURO, AND IS THE PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE.  NKALA BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A </p><p>JOURNALIST, AND FIRST BECAME INVOLVED IN NATIONALIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN THE LATE 1950\'S.  HE WAS A FOUNDING </p><p>MEMBER OF ZANU, AND WAS DETAINED WITH MUGABE AND OTHER </p><p>ZANU LEADERS FROM 1964 TO 1974.  NKALA WAS BORN IN </p><p>1932.  HE WAS A WIDOWER; HE REMARRIED IN 1987.  HE HAS </p><p>THREE CHILDREN FROM HIS FIRST MARRIAGE.  NKALA TRAVELED </p><p>TO THE US IN 1987 ON A USIS IV GRANT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THOUGH AN NDEBELE, NKALA IS PERSONALLY VERY LOYAL </p><p>TO MUGABE AND SUPPORTS THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO (PERHAPS </p><p>BECAUSE HE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT AMONG HIS OWN TRIBE).  NKALA HAS LIVED IN </p><p>HARARE FOR MANY YEARS AND HIS HOME WAS A MEETING PLACE </p><p>FOR THE FOUNDERS OF ZANU.  WHILE NKALA WAS DETAINED ALONG </p><p>WITH OTHER ZANU LEADERS, HE SUPPORTED MUGABE\'S BID TO </p><p>REPLACE SITHOLE AS ZANU PRESIDENT.  MUGABE IS SAID TO </p><p>HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN NKALA.  AS THE </p><p>MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, NKALA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE </p><p>DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE PERSECUTION OF ZAPU IN THE </p><p>LAST YEAR.  IT IS ALSO REPORTED THAT NKALA WAS NAMED </p><p>TO THE DEFENSE MINISTRY AFTER THE ZEZURU CLIQUE OBJECTED </p><p>TO MUGABE\'S PLAN TO NAME EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, A KARANGA, </p><p>TO THAT POST.  SOURCES INDICATE THAT NKALA\'S MISSION IS </p><p>TO ASSERT CIVILIAN CONTROL OVER THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE </p><p>COMMANDS AND CRACK DOWN ON CORRUPTION WITHIN THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  MOVEN MAHACHI </p><p>-- MAHACHI, WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE MINISTER OF </p><p>LANDS, AGRICULTURE, AND RURAL RESETTLEMENT, HAS TAKEN </p><p>OVER THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS FROM ENOS NKALA. </p><p>THOUGH HE IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE CABINET </p><p>(BORN 1948), MAHACHI HAS BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  HE FIRST SERVED AS DEPUTY MINISTER FOR </p><p>LANDS, RESETTLEMENT, AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT, BECOMING THE </p><p>MINISTER IN FEBRUARY 1982.  THE AGRICULTURE PORTFOLIO </p><p>WAS LATER ADDED TO HIS MINISTRY IN JULY 1985.  DURING </p><p>THE NATIONALIST STRUGGLE, MAHACHI SERVED AS AN </p><p>UNDERGROUND OPERATIVE IN SUPPORT OF ZANU.  HE WAS </p><p>ARRESTED IN 1975 AND DETAINED UNTIL 1979.  MAHACHI IS </p><p>MARRIED AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN.  HE JOINED THE ANGLICAN </p><p>CHURCH AS A YOUNG MAN. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) MAHACHI IS A MANYIKA, BUT HE HAS NO INDEPENDENT </p><p>POLITICAL BASE.  HIS POSITION IN GOVERNMENT IS DUE TO </p><p>HIS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MUGABE.  DURING THE </p><p>NATIONALIST STRUGGLE, MAHACHI WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>SECRETLY CONVEYING MUGABE TO MOZAMBIQUE IN 1975 TO </p><p>AVOID ANOTHER ARREST.  ONCE INSIDE MOZAMBIQUE, MUGABE </p><p>CONSOLIDATED HIS CONTROL OVER ZANU/ZANLA AND BECAME </p><p>THE PREEMINENT NATIONALIST LEADER.  MAHACHI SHOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO MUGABE AS HE MANAGES </p><p>THE DIFFICULT HOME AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO.  AS A MUGABE </p><p>LOYALIST, MAHACHI CAN BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE ZEZURU </p><p>POLITICAL ASCENDENCY.  A SOURCE TELLS US THAT MAHACHI </p><p>WAS ALONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECENT RELEASE OF TWO </p><p>WHITE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR THE </p><p>LAST TWO YEARS ON SUSPICION OF SPYING FOR SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>IT IS RUMORED THAT MAHACHI WAS REPRIMANDED FOR THIS </p><p>ACTION.  THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT MAHACHI IS HAVING </p><p>TROUBLE WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE AND THAT THE </p><p>COMMISSIONER DOES NOT ALWAYS CARRY OUT MAHACHI\'S ORDERS. </p><p>SOME OBSERVERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MAHACHI MAY BE </p><p>"TOO SOFT" FOR HIS CURRENT ASSIGNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE, AND RURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT:  DAVID KARIMANZIRA </p><p>-- TOOK OVER THIS PORTFOLIO FROM MOVEN MAHACHI.  HE IS </p><p>ANOTHER YOUNG MINISTER (BORN 1947) BUT, UNLIKE MAHACHI, </p><p>WAS ONLY APPOINTED TO THE CABINET IN 1985 AFTER HIS </p><p>FIRST ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT AS THE MINISTER OF SPORT, </p><p>YOUTH AND CULTURE.  KARIMANZIRA HAS, HOWEVER, SERVED IN </p><p>VARIOUS NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT POSITIONS </p><p>SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  IN 1980 HE WAS APPOINTED AS THE </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION IN MUGABE\'S FIRST </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND LATER BECAME DEPUTY MINISTER.  HE HAS </p><p>ALSO SERVED AS A PROVINCIAL OFFICER FOR ZANU.  HE IS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE ZANU CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND IS THE PARTY\'S </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY. </p><p>KARIMANZIRA RECEIVED HIS UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN </p><p>RHODESIA, AND ALSO STUDIED IN THE UK IN THE LATTER HALF </p><p>OF THE 1970\'S.  DURING THAT TIME HE WAS ACTIVE IN ZANU\'S </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UK.  HE IS MARRIED (HIS WIFE WORKS </p><p>IN THE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE) AND THEY HAVE TWO </p><p>CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) KARIMANZIRA IS A ZEZURU AND IS CONSIDERED MORE </p><p>OF AN APPARATCHIK THAN A POLITICIAN WITH AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>BASE.  AS A ZEZURU HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO UPHOLD THE </p><p>POLITICAL STATUS QUO.  KARIMANZIRA HAS THE REPUTATION </p><p>FOR BEING CRITICAL OF THE US AND HE HAS THE DUBIOUS </p><p>DISTINCTION OF MAKING THE SPEECH AT EMBASSY HARARE\'S </p><p>FOURTH OF JULY (1986) RECEPTION THAT PROMPTED FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT CARTER TO WALK OUT.  KARIMANZIRA DID NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, WRITE THE OFFENDING SPEECH AND WAS SPEAKING </p><p>AT THE TIME ON BEHALF OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) MINISTER OF YOUTH, SPORT, AND CULTURE:  DAVID </p><p>KWIDINI </p><p>--  HAS TAKEN OVER THIS MINISTRY FROM DAVID </p><p>KARIMANZIRA.  KWIDINI IS AN NDEBELE WHO, AS A ZAPU MP </p><p>AND MEMBER OF THE ZAPU CENTRAL COMMITTEE, CROSSED OVER </p><p>TO JOIN ZANU IN MAY 1986.  THIS IS KWIDINI\'S FIRST </p><p>APPOINTMENT TO GOVERNMENT.  KWIDINI IS AN EDUCATOR BY </p><p>PROFESSION AND IS NOW ALSO SERVING AS THE INTERIM </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ALL AFRICA PARLIAMENTRAY </p><p>COUNCIL ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>23. (U) MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>AFFAIRS:  EMMERSON MNANGAGWA (ALSO SPELLED MUNANGAGWA) </p><p>--  TOOK OVER THIS PORTFOLIO FROM EDDISON ZVOBGO, WHO IS </p><p>NOW ONE OF THE MINISTERS OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS </p><p>ATTACHED TO ZANU HEADQUARTERS.  MNANGAGWA IS A VETERAN </p><p>ZANLA GUERILLA LEADER WHO, SINCE INDEPENDENCE, HAS </p><p>SERVED AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p>MNANGAGWA JOINED ZANU IN 1963, AND WAS AMONG THE FIRST </p><p>GROUP OF FIVE ZANU GUERILLAS TO TRAVEL TO THE PRC FOR </p><p>TRAINING.  HE WAS ARRESTED BY THE RHODESIAN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES IN 1965 AND WAS IMPRISONED UNTIL 1974.  ONCE </p><p>RELEASED, HE WENT TO ZAMBIA AND OBTAINED A LAW DEGREE. </p><p>HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE ZAMBIAN BAR IN 1976.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>IS THE ZANU POLITBURO SECRETARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p>HE IS MARRIED AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) MNANGAGWA HAS BEEN A LONG-TIME ADVISOR TO </p><p>MUGABE ON SECURITY MATTERS, AND SOURCES REPORT THAT HE </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE NAMED MINISTER OF DEFENSE OR HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>IN THE NEW CABINET.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, A </p><p>ZEZURU CLIQUE (LED BY NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA AND SIDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI) IN THE GOZ PERSUADED MUGABE NOT TO APPOINT </p><p>MNANGAGWA, A KARANGA, TO A SECURITY MINISTRY.  WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT MNANGAGWA WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HIS </p><p>NEW ASSIGNMENT AS JUSTICE MINISTER, ESPECIALLY SINCE </p><p>JUSTICE\'S MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN RECENT YEARS (I.E. </p><p>DRAFTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS FOR ENDING </p><p>RACIAL REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT AND ESTABLISHING </p><p>AN EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY) HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  WE HEARD </p><p>THAT MNANGAGWA WAS EVEN CONSIDERING AT ONE POINT RETIRING </p><p>FROM GOVERNMENT AND GOING INTO PRIVATE BUSINESS, BUT </p><p>HE IS NOW SAID TO HAVE ACCEPTED HIS NEW POSITION.  IT </p><p>IS STILL NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, IF MNANGAGWA WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO SERVE AS ZANU\'S SECRETARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY:  SYDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI </p><p>-- HAS TAKEN OVER MNANGAGWA\'S FORMER POSITION AND </p><p>OPERATES OUT OF THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  SEKERAMAYI IS A </p><p>PHYSICIAN BY TRAINING (HAVING BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST </p><p>STUDENTS TO BE SPONSORED BY ZANU FOR OVERSEAS STUDIES IN </p><p>THE 1960\'S; HE STUDIED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND SWEDEN </p><p>WHERE HE OBTAINED HIS M.D.).  HE BRIEFLY WORKED IN </p><p>SWEDEN BEFORE MOVING TO SET UP HIS MEDICAL PRACTICE IN </p><p>ZAMBIA, WHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL 1976 WHEN HE WENT TO UK </p><p>FOR SPECIALIZED SURGICAL TRAINING.  HE WAS RECALLED BY </p><p>ZANU TO SERVE WITH ZANLA IN MOZAMBIQUE.  HE JOINED THE </p><p>ZANU CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN 1977.  HE IS NOW A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO AND SERVES AS THE PARTY\'S SECRETARY FOR </p><p>TRANSPORT.  IN 1980 SEKERAMAYI BECAME THE MINISTER OF </p><p>LANDS, RESETTLEMENT, AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT.  HE BECAME </p><p>THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENSE IN FEBRUARY 1982 AND </p><p>WAS THE ACTING MINISTER OF HEALTH.  HE WAS FORMALLY </p><p>APPOINTED AS MINISTER OF HEALTH IN JANUARY 1984 AND HELD </p><p>THAT PORTFOLIO UNTIL THE FORMATION OF THIS NEW CABINET. </p><p>SEKERAMAYI WAS BORN IN 1944 AND IS MARRIED. </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) SEKERAMAYI IS A ZEZURU, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>THE MAIN REASON IN COMBINATION WITH HIS PREVIOUS </p><p>EXPERIENCE AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENSE, FOR </p><p>REPLACING MNANGAGWA AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT SEKERAMAYI WAS, </p><p>ALONG WITH NEW FOMIN SHAMUYARIRA, ONE OF THE LEADERS </p><p>OF THE ZEZURU CLIQUE WHICH BLOCKED MNANGAGWA\'S APPOINTMENT </p><p>AS MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  SEKERAMAYI CAN BE EXPECTED </p><p>THEREFORE TO SUPPORT THE ZEZURU NOMINATION OF THE GOZ </p><p>TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE KARANGA.  HE IS AN IMPRESSIVE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL IN CONVERSATION AND APPEARS BOTH BRIGHTER </p><p>AND MORE ARTICULATE THAN MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES.  HE </p><p>MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE FUTURE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>27. (U) MINISTER OF HEALTH:  BRIGADIER FELIX MUCHEMWA </p><p>--  HAS TAKEN OVER FROM SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI AS THE NEW </p><p>MINISTER OF HEALTH.  MUCHEMWA IS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE ARMY\'S MEDICAL SERVICES, AND SERVED AS THE COMMANDER </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD UNTIL OCTOBER 1987 WHEN HE WAS </p><p>ELECTED AS A NON-CONSTITUENT MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT. </p><p>MUCHEMWA WAS FORMERLY A ZANLA GUERILLA. </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) MUCHEMWA IS A MANYIKA AND AS SUCH CAN BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO.  SOURCES </p><p>HAVE TOLD US THAT MUCHEMWA WAS, IN EFFECT, "KICKED </p><p>UPSTAIRS" BY MUGABE WHEN MUGABE INCLUDED MUCHEMWA ON </p><p>THE ZANU LIST FOR ELECTION TO A NON-CONSTITUENT SEAT </p><p>IN THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.  AS A RESULT OF THIS ELECTION, </p><p>MUCHEMWA, WHO ONLY BECAME A BRIGADIER IN NOVEMBER 1986, </p><p>HAD TO RESIGN FROM THE ARMY.  MUCHEMWA APPARENTLY DID </p><p>NOT HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION AS A MILITARY OFFICER, AND </p><p>IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT HE HAS A DRUG PROBLEM.  AS </p><p>THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF ARMY MEDICAL SERVICES, MUCHEMWA </p><p>SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ON DEALING </p><p>WITH AIDS AND STD.  SUCH EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE USEFUL </p><p>FOR THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WHICH IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH AIDS IN ZIMBABWE.  AS IS THE CASE WITH </p><p>THE TWO OTHER MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY </p><p>APPOINTED TO THE GOZ, MUCHEMWA HOLDS A NON-CONSTITUENT </p><p>SEAT IN PARLIAMENT AND DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL BASE </p><p>OF HIS OWN.  (SEE REF D FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE MILITARY OFFICERS IN THE CABINET.) </p><p> </p><p>29. (U) MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:  SIMBARASHE MUMBENGEGWI </p><p>--  REPLACED HERBERT USHEWOKUNZE.  MUMBENGEGWI </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HELD A NUMBER OF OTHER CABINET POSTIONS AS </p><p>THE MINISTER OF WATER RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT, THE </p><p>MINISTER OF HOUSING, AND THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AND NATIONAL HOUSING, WHICH PORTFOLIO HE </p><p>HELD UNTIL THE FORMATION OF THIS CURRENT GOVERNMENT. </p><p>MUMBENGEGWI ALSO SERVED AS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER FROM </p><p>INDEPENDENCE TO FEBRUARY 1982 AND HAS ACTED AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.  HE BECAME ACTIVE IN </p><p>POLITICS AS A MEMBER OF ZAPU AND LATER ZANU YOUTH </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  HE ATTENDED UNIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA AND </p><p>RECEIVED A DEGREE IN EDUCATION.  FROM 1973 TO 1978 HE </p><p>WAS ZANU\'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE IN AUSTRALIA.  BETWEEN </p><p>1978 AND 1980 HE WAS THE CHIEF ZANU REP IN ZAMBIA. </p><p>MUMBENGEGWI HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT SINCE 1980. </p><p>MUMBENGEGWI WAS BORN IN 1945, IS MARRIED AND HAS ONE </p><p>CHILD. </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) MUMBENGEGWI IS SAID TO BE A LOYAL CIVIL SERVANT </p><p>RATHER THAN A POLITICIAN WITH HIS OWN POLITICAL BASE. </p><p>HE IS A KARANGA, SAID TO BE ALLIED WITH THE KARANGA </p><p>FACTION LED BY VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA.  HE HAS A </p><p>REPUTATION FOR DILIGENT HARD WORK AND HONESTY, </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS APPOINTED TO CLEAN UP THE MESS </p><p>LEFT BY THE CORRUPT, OPPORTUNISTIC USHOWOKUNZE. </p><p> </p><p>31. (U) MINISTER OF PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION AND NATIONAL </p><p>HOUSING:  JOSEPH MSIKA </p><p>--  HAS TAKEN OVER THIS MINISTRY FROM SIMBARASHE </p><p>MUMBENGEGWI.  MSIKA IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ZAPU AND </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE GOVERNMENT AS THE MINISTER OF </p><p>NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER DEVELOPMENT FROM APRIL 1980 </p><p>TO FEBRUARY 1982 WHEN ZAPU MINISTERS WERE DEPOSED. </p><p>BEFORE GOING INTO ZAPU POLITICS, MSIKA WAS TRAINED AS A </p><p>CABINET MAKER AND LATER WAS A TRADE UNION OFFICIAL IN </p><p>THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY.  IN HIS NEW CABINET POSITION MSIKA </p><p>WILL BE REPORTING TO SENIOR MINISTER NKOMO, WHO IS ALSO </p><p>HIS PARTY LEADER.  MSIKA WAS BORN IN 1923.  MSIKA WAS </p><p>PART OF THE ZAPU DELEGATION WHICH NEGOTIATED THE </p><p>ZANU/ZAPU UNITY AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>32. (C) MSIKA IS A ZEZURU BUT WAS RAISED IN MATABELELAND </p><p>AND IS A LONG-TIME ZAPU MEMBER AND OFFICIAL.  HE CAN BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO SIDE WITH JOSHUA NKOMO AND THE NDEBELES </p><p>SHOULD THEY CHALLENGE THE SHONA DOMINANCE OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL MACHINERY.  MSIKA JOINED ZAPU AT A </p><p>TIME WHEN THAT ORGANIZATION HAD MANY ZEZURU MEMBERS AND </p><p>WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN NDEBELE TRIBAL ENCLAVE.  SUBSEQUENT </p><p>DIVISIONS IN ZAPU IN THE EARLY 1960\'S CAUSED MANY SHONA </p><p>TO SHIFT ALLEGIANCE TO ZANU.  MSIKA REMAINED LOYAL TO </p><p>ZAPU. </p><p> </p><p>33. (U) MINISTER OF LABOUR, MANPOWER PLANNING, AND </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE:  JOHN NKOMO </p><p>--  ANOTHER HIGH RANKING ZAPU LEADER WHO HAS BEEN NAMED </p><p>TO THE CABINET.  NKOMO TAKES OVER AS MINISTER OF LABOUR </p><p>FROM FREDRICK SHAVA.  NKOMO (WHO IS NOT RELATED TO ZAPU </p><p>PRESIDENT JOSHUA NKOMO) PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>AS DEPUTY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT </p><p>UNTIL APRIL 1982 WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED AS THE MINISTER </p><p>OF STATE WITH SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER.  IN THIS CAPACITY IT IS SAID THAT HE DEVELOPED </p><p>AN OVERALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE OPERATIONS OF EACH </p><p>MINISTRY.  NKOMO WAS RELIEVED OF HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN NOVEMBER 1984 </p><p>BECAUSE HE CONTINUED TO SIT ON THE ZAPU CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE.  NKOMO IS THE ZAPU SECRETARY FOR PUBLICITY </p><p>AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE ZAPU DELEGATION WHICH NEGOTIATED </p><p>THE ZANU/ZAPU UNITY AGREEMENT.  NKOMO TRAVELED TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN 1986 AS A USIA IV GRANTEE. </p><p> </p><p>34. (C) EMBASSY HAS FOUND NKOMO TO BE A USEFUL AND </p><p>THOUGHTFUL INTERLOCUTOR.  HE SEEMS TO HAVE A CLEAR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF ZIMBABWE\'S PROBLEMS AND IS INCLINED </p><p>TO ACT.  AS THE NEW MINISTER OF LABOUR, NKOMO HAS </p><p>PUBLICALLY STATED THAT THE COUNTRY\'S LABOUR RELATIONS </p><p>ACT  (LRA) NEEDS ADJUSTMENT.  IN PRIVATE, HOWEVER, HE </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE LRA NEEDS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY OVERHAULED. </p><p>NKOMO IS A SHREWD POLITICIAN WHO SOMETIMES APPEARS TO </p><p>BE PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET AT ONCE.  THERE ARE </p><p>STORIES THAT HE SPOKE OUT IN ZAPU COUNCILS AGAINST UNITY </p><p>WITH ZANU WHILE AT THE SAME TIME KEEPING IN CLOSE </p><p>CONTACT WITH ZANU OFFICIALS.  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT </p><p>NKOMO REMAINED IN HIS PREVIOUS GOZ POSITION UNTIL 1984 </p><p>WHEN ALL OTHER ZANU OFFICIALS WERE SACKED FROM THE GOZ </p><p>IN 1982. </p><p> </p><p>35. (U) MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION:  DZINGAI MUTUMBUKA </p><p>--  HAS BEEN THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION SINCE 1980, BUT </p><p>WITH THE FORMATION OF THIS NEW CABINET, HE HAS LOST </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL </p><p>EDUCATION (WHICH HAVE BEEN GROUPED INTO A NEW MINISTRY </p><p>UNDER THE DIRECTION OF FAY CHUNG) AND WILL NOW CONTINUE </p><p>AS THE MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION.  MUTUMBUKA IS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE ZANU POLITBURO, AND SERVES AS THE PARTY\'S </p><p>SECRETARY FOR PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>MUTUMBUKA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PERSONS TO JOIN ZANU IN </p><p>THE 1970\'S WHO HAD A HIGHER EDUCATION.  HE OBTAINED A </p><p>DOCTORATE DEGREE IN CHEMISTRY IN THE UK AND TAUGHT </p><p>CHEMISTRY IN ZAMBIA UNTIL HE JOINED THE ARMED STUGGLE IN </p><p>1974.  HE HAS REPRESENTED ZANU AT A NUMBER OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES.  MUTUMBUKA TRAVELED TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN 1982 AS A USIA IV GRANTEE. </p><p> </p><p>36. (C) MUTUMBUKA IS A KARANGA WHO HAS BEEN LOYAL TO </p><p>MUGABE AND THE ZEZURU CLIQUE.  NONETHELESS, THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN SPECULATION THAT AS A KARANGA HE WAS DISCRIMINATED </p><p>AGAINST IN THE FORMATION OF THIS NEW CABINET WHEN MORE </p><p>THAN HALF OF HIS PORTFOLIO WAS TAKEN FROM HIM.  WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD THAT MUTUMBUKA IS ANGERED THAT HIS PORTFOLIO HAS </p><p>BEEN REDUCED TO HIGHER EDUCATION SINCE THERE IS ONLY ONE </p><p>INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION (THE UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE) FOR HIM TO OVERSEE.  THE ISSUE OF WHICH </p><p>MINISTRY WILL BE IN CHARGE OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING HAS </p><p>NOT YET BEEN SETTLED.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, AN ALTERNATIVE </p><p>EXPLANATION FOR THE REDUCTION OF MUTUMBUKA\'S PORTFOLIO. </p><p>SINCE 1980 MUTUMBUKA HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY OF MASS EDUCATION WHICH EACH YEAR </p><p>TURNS OUT INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBERS OF "SCHOOL LEAVERS" </p><p>WHO EXPECT WHITE COLLAR EMPLOYMENT OR POSITIONS IN THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY.  BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CAN ONLY ADMIT A </p><p>SMALL NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL LEAVERS EACH YEAR, AND </p><p>JOB CREATION OUTSIDE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE HAS BEEN </p><p>VIRTUALLY NIL, THE POOL OF ZIMBABWE\'S UNEMPLOYED YOUNG </p><p>PEOPLE IS GROWING RAPIDLY AND THE GOZ IS NOW VERY </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS </p><p>OF SUCH AN UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM.  IT MAY BE THEREFORE </p><p>THAT MUGABE BLAMES MUTUMBUKA FOR THIS "SCHOOL LEAVERS" </p><p>CRISIS AND HAS PUNISHED HIM BY TAKING AWAY RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>37.  MINISTER OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION:  FAY </p><p>CHUNG </p><p>--  HAS TAKEN OVER THIS NEW MINISTRY WHICH WAS SPUN OFF </p><p>FROM THE ORIGINAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.  CHUNG, A </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN OF CHINESE DESCENT, WAS NAMED DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>OF EDUCATION SHORTLY BEFORE HER ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT </p><p>AS A NON-CONSTITUENT MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY IN </p><p>OCTOBER 1987.  SHE HAD SERVED IN THE MINISTRY\'S </p><p>CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT UNIT FROM 1983 TO 1987.  CHUNG </p><p>WAS A PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER.  SHE JOINED </p><p>ZANU IN 1973 AND MOVED TO MOZAMBIQUE IN 1975 WHERE SHE </p><p>WORKED IN POLITICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULUM </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  IN THIS CAPACITY SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>TEACHER TRAINING AND TEXTBOOK PRODUCTION.  CHUNG\'S </p><p>TEACHER-TRAINING PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE IS SAID TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN THE FORERUNNER OF THE CURRENT ZIMBABWE INTEGRATED </p><p>NATIONAL TEACHER EDUCATION COURSE (ZINTEC), IN WHICH </p><p>CHUNG HAS CONTINUED TO BE ACTIVE.  SHE ALSO HAD A ROLE </p><p>IN DEVELOPING THE ZIMBABWE FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATION WITH </p><p>PRODUCTION (ZIMFEP).  CHUNG RECEIVED HER B.A. AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF RHODESIA, AND EARNED AN M.A. AT LEEDS (UK) </p><p>UNIVERSITY.  SHE WAS BORN IN 1941 AND HAS ONE CHILD. </p><p>SHE IS EXPECTED TO TRAVEL TO THE US ON A USIS IV GRANT </p><p>IN MID-1981. </p><p> </p><p>38. (C) CHUNG HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A LOCAL OPINION </p><p>MAGAZINE AS THE "STAR APPOINTEE" IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT, </p><p>AND IT IS CLEAR THAT CHUNG\'S STAR HAS BEEN ON THE RISE </p><p>IN THE LAST YEAR.  CHUNG, WHO HAS A REPUTATION FOR </p><p>HAVING RADICAL POLITICAL VIEWS, IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A </p><p>LECTURER ON IDEOLOGY FOR THE ZANLA CADRES IN MOZAMBIQUE. </p><p>CHUNG REPORTEDLY IS ALSO A DEVOUT CATHOLIC.  SHE HAD </p><p>HER CHILD DURING HER STAY IN THE BUSH, BUT SHE DID NOT </p><p>MARRY, AND THE FATHER\'S IDENTITY IS NOT PUBLICLY KNOWN. </p><p>WHILE IN MOZAMBIQUE CHUNG WAS REPORTEDLY CLOSE TO MUGABE, </p><p>BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT SHE AND MUGABE HAD A SERIOUS </p><p>FALLING OUT WHICH RESULTED IN HER BEING IGNORED BY THE </p><p>PARTY AND UNEMPLOYED AFTER INDEPENDENCE.  THIS INCIDENT </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE PRESS WHICH HAS FEATURED </p><p>ARTICLES ON HER RECENTLY.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PROMPTED </p><p>CHUNG\'S RECENT RETURN TO FAVOR WITH MUGABE.  CHUNG DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT POLITICAL BASE AND HER POSITION </p><p>RESTS ON THE CONTINUED FAVOR OF MUGABE.  HER RAPID </p><p>ELEVATION TO THE MINISTRY OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY </p><p>EDUCATION MAY VERY WELL BE DUE TO THE URGENT NEED FOR </p><p>THE GOZ TO RESTRUCTURE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO REMEDY </p><p>THE SCHOOL LEAVER CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>39. (U) MINISTER OF COMMUNITY AND CO-OPERATIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS:  TERAI ROPA (JOYCE) </p><p>MUJURU A/K/A:  TERAI ROPA NHONGO </p><p>--  IS A MEMBER OF THE ZANU POLITBURO AND SERVES AS </p><p>PARTY SECRETARY FOR WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS.  IN 1980 SHE BECAME </p><p>THE FIRST WOMAN AND YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE CABINET WHEN </p><p>SHE WAS APPOINTED AS THE MINISTER OF YOUTH, SPORT, AND </p><p>CULTURE.  SINCE JANUARY 1981 SHE HAS SERVED AS THE </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND WOMEN\'S </p><p>AFFAIRS ATTACHED TO THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE.  WITH </p><p>THE FORMATION OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, MUJURU\'S OFFICE </p><p>HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A MINISTRY WITH THE ADDITION OF </p><p>COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.  DURING </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, MUJURU JOINED ZANLA IN </p><p>1973, BECAME A MEMBER OF THE GENERAL STAFF, AND WAS </p><p>OVERALL COMMANDER OF THE WOMEN\'S DETACHMENT WHEN IT WAS </p><p>FORMED IN 1974.  MUJURU IS A MEMBER OF THE POLITBURO AND </p><p>SERVES AS THE PARTY SECRETARY FOR WOMENS AFFAIRS.  SHE </p><p>IS MARRIED TO THE ARMY COMMANDER AND HAS THREE CHILDREN, </p><p>BUT IS ESTRANGED FROM HIM.  SHE IS A ZEZURU AND WAS BORN </p><p>IN 1955. </p><p> </p><p>40. (U) MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND TOURISM: </p><p>VICTORIA CHITEPO </p><p> </p><p>--  IS THE THIRD AND FINAL WOMAN IN THE CABINET.  SHE </p><p>HAS HELD THIS PORTFOLIO SINCE FEBRUARY 1982, HAVING </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS DEPUTY MINISTER SINCE JANUARY </p><p>1981.  HER PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT WAS AS DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>FOR EDUCATION AND CULTURE, TO WHICH SHE WAS APPOINTED IN </p><p>1980.  CHITEPO, A TEACHER BY TRAINING, IS THE WIDOW OF </p><p>HERBERT CHITEPO, THE ZANU NATIONAL CHAIRMAN WHO WAS </p><p>ASSASSINATED IN ZAMBIA IN 1977.  SHE TRAVELED TO THE US </p><p>IN 1985 ON A USIA IV GRANT.  CHITEPO WAS BORN IN 1927. </p><p> </p><p>41. (C) CHITEPO IS SAID TO OWE HER POSITION IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO RESPECT FOR HER LATE HUSBAND.  SHE IS A VERY POOR </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR.  SHE IS A MANYIKA, BUT DOES NOT APPARENTLY </p><p>HAVE HER OWN POLITICAL FOLLOWING. </p><p> </p><p>42. (U) MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, RURAL AND URBAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT:  ENOS CHIKORWORE </p><p>--  HAS HELD THIS PORTFOLIO SINCE FEBRUARY 1982.  HE </p><p>PREVIOUSLY WAS APPOINTED AS DEPUTY MINISTER IN JANUARY </p><p>1981.  CHIKOWORE BECAME ACTIVE IN POLITICS IN THE LATE </p><p>1950\'S AND JOINED ZANU IN 1963.  AFTER BEING DETAINED HE </p><p>WENT TO ZAMBIA WERE HE SERVED AS THE PARTY\'S FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND WAS ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>RECRUITING OF CADRES.  HE LEFT TO STUDY IN THE UK IN </p><p>1967 AND RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE IN 1980 WHERE HE WAS </p><p>ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY AS A REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>FROM MASHONALAND WEST.  CHIKOWORE WAS BORN IN 1936 AND </p><p>IS A ZEZURU. </p><p> </p><p>43. (U) MINISTER OF ENERGY, WATER RESOURCES AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT:  KUMBIRAI KANGAI </p><p>--  HAS ALSO RETAINED HIS FORMER CABINET POSITION. </p><p>KANGAI JOINED THE GOVERNMENT IN 1980 AND FIRST SERVED AS </p><p>THE MINISTER OF LABOR.  HE LATER BECAME THE MINISTER OF </p><p>ENERGY, WATER RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT, THE POSITION HE </p><p>CONTINUES TO HOLD.  A TEACHER BY PROFESSION, KANGAI </p><p>JOINED ZANU IN 1963 BUT WENT TO THE US IN 1964 WHEN HE </p><p>LOST HIS TEACHING POSITION FOLLOWING AN ARREST FOR </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.  HE STUDIED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>CALIFORNIA (CAMPUS UNKNOWN) UNTIL 1972, AND SERVED AS </p><p>ZANU\'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE TO NORTH AMERICA DURING PART </p><p>OF THAT TIME.  HE WENT TO ZAMBIA IN 1973 AND WAS ELECTED </p><p>AS A MEMBER OF THE ZANU REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (DARE). </p><p>KANGAI, A MANYIKA, WAS BORN IN 1938. </p><p> </p><p>44. (U) MINISTER OF MINES:  RICHARD HOVE </p><p>--  BECAME THE MINISTER OF MINES IN JULY 1985, AND HE </p><p>RETAINS THAT PORTFOLIO IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

(U) MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY:  CALLISTUS </p><p>NDLOVU </p><p>--  HAS BEEN REAPPOINTED TO THIS MINISTRY, A POSITION </p><p>WHICH HE HAS HELD SINCE JULY 1985.  PRIOR TO THIS </p><p>ASSIGNMENT, NDLOVU WAS APPOINTED MINISTER OF </p><p>CONSTRUCTION IN JANUARY 1982, AND LATER TOOK OVER THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF MINES FROM MAURICE NYAGUMBO IN JANUARY </p><p>1984.

(U) MINISTER OF TRADE AND COMMERCE:  OLIVER </p><p>MUNYARADZI </p><p>--  HAS ALSO BEEN REAPPOINTED TO HIS PREVIOUS POSITION. </p><p>HE BECAME THE MINISTER OF TRADE AND COMMERCE IN JULY </p><p>1985.

(U) MINISTER OF STATE FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE:  CHRIS </p><p>ANDERSON </p><p>--  ANDERSON, CONSIDERED BY SOME TO BE THE BEST LAWYER </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, RETAINS HIS PORTFOLIO AS THE MINISTER OF </p><p>STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE, A POSITION HE HAS HELD SINCE </p><p>1982.  ANDERSON BECAME A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE </p><p>RHODESIAN FRONT IN 1974.  HE WAS APPOINTED MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE IN THE SMITH GOVERNMENT IN 1978 AND LATER BECAME </p><p>THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE IN THE MUZOREWA GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>1979.  ANDERSON CONTINUED TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT AFTER </p><p>INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, BUT HE LEFT THE RHODESIAN FRONT IN </p><p>1982 TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT.  MUGABE APPOINTED HIM </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE THAT SAME YEAR. </p><p>ANDERSON IS THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BAR AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>SIT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT.  BORN IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG IN 1935, ANDERSON CAME TO RHODESIA WITH HIS </p><p>FAMILY IN 1938.  HE TRAVELED TO THE US IN 1985 ON A USIA </p><p>IV GRANT.  ANDERSON IS MARRIED AND HAS THREE CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>50. (C) AS A MEMBER OF THE RF, ANDERSON WAS KNOWN FOR </p><p>ESPOUSING RACIST VIEWS.  HE DID A COMPLETE ABOUT FACE </p><p>IN 1982.  HE IS THOUGHT TO BE KEPT IN HIS MINISTERIAL </p><p>POSITION BY MUGABE IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE INTEGRITY </p><p>WITHIN THE CIVIL SERVICE.  HE HAS NO POLITICAL BASE IN </p><p>THE WHITE COMMUNITY AND IS NOT REGARDED BY WHITES AS </p><p>"THEIR SPOKESMAN" IN GOVERNMENT.  HE IS AN AVID FLY </p><p>FISHERMAN. </p><p> </p><p>51. (U) MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS: </p><p>JOSEPH CULVERWELL </p><p>--  CULVERWELL IS NEW TO THE CABINET, HAVING PREVIOUSLY </p><p>SERVED AS THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION.  HE IS THE </p><p>ONLY "COLOURED" MINISTER.  A TEACHER BY PROFESSION, </p><p>CULVERWELL WAS EDUCATED IN SOUTH AFRICA AND BRITAIN.  HE </p><p>WAS IMPRISONED FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN 1967 AND </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE WENT TO WORK AS A TEACHER IN THE </p><p>UK.  DURING THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT HE WAS ACTIVE </p><p>ASSISTING ZIMBABWEANS WHO WERE IN EXILE IN BRITAIN. </p><p>CULVERWELL RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE IN 1980 TO CAMPAIGN FOR </p><p>ZANU.  AFTER THE ELECTION HE WAS APPOINTED TO THE </p><p>SENATE.  CULVERWELL HAS SERVED CONTINUOUSLY IN THE </p><p>SENATE SINCE 1980 AND SINCE 1981 HE HAS SERVED AS DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER FOR EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>52. (C) CULVERWELL, A COLOURED, IS REPORTEDLY NOT VERY </p><p>POPULAR WITH THE COLOURED POPULATION IN ZIMBABWE.  HIS </p><p>POLITICAL POSITION IS DUE TO HIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH MUGABE AND OTHER ZANU BOSSES FOR WHOM HE DID FAVORS </p><p>AND RAN ERRANDS DURING THE LANCASTER HOUSE CONFERENCE IN </p><p>LONDON.  IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR WHAT CULVERWELL IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO DO IN THIS NEWLY CREATED POSITION AND EVEN </p><p>THE LOCAL PRESS HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT IS A "DO NOTHING" </p><p>JOB.  CULVERWELL IS WELL KNOWN AS AN "OLD ROGUE" WHO IS </p><p>USUALLY SEEN IN THE COMPANY OF LADY FRIENDS MUCH YOUNGER </p><p>THAN HE.  HE IS A FREQUENT VISITOR TO LOCAL NIGHT SPOTS, </p><p>THOUGH HAS GIVEN UP SMOKING AND ALCOHOL FOR HEALTH REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY CABINET MINISTERS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>53. (U) FIFTEEN DEPUTY CABINET MINISTERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>APPOINTED TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT (UP FROM THE ELEVEN </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERS WHICH WERE FEATURED IN THE PREVIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT).  NOT ALL MINISTRIES HAVE DEPUTY MINISTERS, </p><p>AND WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE MINISTRIES WHICH DEAL MOST </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH NATIONAL SECURITY (SUCH AS FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS, DEFENSE, AND HOME AFFAIRS) DO NOT/NOT HAVE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERS.  WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF DEPUTY MINISTERS IS TYPICAL FOR CERTAIN KEY </p><p>MINISTRIES BECAUSE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MINISTER FROM </p><p>A KEY MINISTRY, MUGABE APPOINTS ANOTHER OF HIS CLOSEST </p><p>MINISTERS TO ACT IN THE PLACE OF THE ABSENT MINISTER </p><p>RATHER THAN ALLOW THE MANAGEMENT OF A KEY MINISTRY TO </p><p>FALL TO A DEPUTY MINISTER.  THE DEPUTY MINISTERS IN THE </p><p>CURRENT GOVERNMENT ARE: </p><p> </p><p>54. (U) KENNETH BUTE, DEPUTY MINISTER FOR COMMUNITY AND </p><p>COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AND WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS: </p><p>--  BUTE IS NEW TO THE GOVERNMENT AND HIS PORTFOLIO IS A </p><p>NEW ADDITION TO THE GOZ SINCE HIS IS ONE OF THE NEWLY </p><p>CREATED MINISTRIES.

KAY IS A COMMERCIAL FARMER FROM THE WEDZA </p><p>DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>59. (C) FELLOW WHITES, INCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, </p><p>ARE NOT VERY IMPRESSED WITH KAY\'S APPOINTMENT.  KAY IS </p><p>INEXPERIENCED IN GOVERNMENT AND HIS PROFESSIONAL </p><p>COMPETENCE IS ALSO QUESTIONABLE.  THE WHITE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS GENERALLY DOUBT THAT KAY WILL BE CAPABLE OF </p><p>SAFEGUARDING THEIR INTERESTS EVEN IF HE WISHES TO. </p><p>KAY HAS BEEN A LONG-TIME, WELL-MEANING AND FAITHFUL </p><p>EMBASSY CONTACT. </p><p> </p><p>60.

ZVOBGO WAS </p><p>DETAINED, DURING WHICH TIME HE STUDIED LAW AND WAS </p><p>ADMITTED TO THE BAR.  HE RETURNED TO THE US IN 1972 TO </p><p>CONTINUE HIS STUDIES AT THE FLETCHER SCHOOL (TUFTS) AND </p><p>HARVARD LAW.  HE LATER TAUGHT AS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR </p><p>AT THE LEWIS UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW IN ILLINOIS. </p><p>ZVOBGO WAS A LEGAL ADVISOR FOR ZANU AT THE GENEVA </p><p>CONFERENCE AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE ZANU DELEGATION AT </p><p>THE LANCASTER HOUSE CONFERENCE.  HE RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>IN 1980 AND WAS THE ZANU ELECTION CHAIRMAN.  ZVOBGO </p><p>TRAVELED TO THE US IN 1987 ON A USIA IV GRANT.  HE IS </p><p>MARRIED TO ANOTHER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, JULIA ZVOBGO, </p><p>AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN.  ZVOBGO WAS BORN IN 1935 AND IS A </p><p>KARANGA. </p><p> </p><p>83. (C) ZVOBGO WAS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH A POPULAR BASE OF SUPPORT </p><p>(IN HIS CASE IN MASVINGO PROVINCE).  HE WAS FORMERLY </p><p>ZANU PARTY CHAIRMAN OF MASVINGO AND A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO BUT WAS RELIEVED OF THESE POSTS IN 1986 </p><p>AS A RESULT OF A POWER STRUGGLE WITH FELLOW KARANGA </p><p>AND THEN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MUZENDA.  HE HAS A </p><p>SERIOUS DRINKING PROBLEM WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED </p><p>TO HIS DEMOTION. </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERS OF STATE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>84. (U) GENERAL JEVAN MASEKO:  IS THE FORMER ARMY CHIEF </p><p>OF STAFF FOR ADMINISTRATION AND QUARTERMASTER.  AS A </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER OF STATE, MASEKO\'S MILITARY EXPERIENCE </p><p>SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL AS HE WILL BE WORKING UNDER </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE KANDUNGURE IN THE PREPARATION OF A </p><p>NATIONAL SERVICE PLAN.  HE LEFT THIS POSITION AND </p><p>RESIGNED HIS COMMISSION TO BECOME A NON-CONSTITUTENT </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IN NOVEMBER 1987.  MASEKO IS A </p><p>FORMER ZIPRA COMBATANT WHO ENTERED THE NEW ZIMBABWE </p><p>NATIONAL ARMY AT INDEPENDENCE.  HE IS AN NDEBELE. </p><p> </p><p>85. (C) MASEKO IS SAID TO BE A PLEASANT FELLOW BUT IS </p><p>CONSIDERED TO BE A MEDIOCRE OFFICER.  THOUGH HE HAS BEEN </p><p>TO SOME EXTENT COOPTED BY THE SHONA HIERARCHY, HE IS </p><p>SAID TO STILL BE POPULAR AMONG THE NDEBELE AND MAINTAIN </p><p>SOME UNOFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH ZAPU.  AS A NON-CONSTITUENT </p><p>MP HE LACKS A CLEARLY DEFINED POLITICAL BASE SO HIS </p><p>FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED GOOD FAVOR OF MUGABE. </p><p>BY ENTERING THE PARLIAMENT MASEKO HAD TO RESIGN HIS </p><p>COMMISSION, SO THE SENIOR NDEBELE OFFICER HAS LEFT THE </p><p>ARMY.  (SEE REF D FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS IN THE CABINET.) </p><p> </p><p>86. (U) SHUVAI MAHOFA:  IS ONE OF TWO WOMEN WHO NOW </p><p>SERVE AS DEPUTY MINISTERS OF STATE.  MAHOFA IS A MEMBER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT FROM MASVINGO PROVINCE.  DURING THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE MAHOFA SERVED IN AN UNDERGROUND </p><p>DETATCHMENT WHICH PROVIDED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>NATIONALIST GUERILLAS.  SINCE INDEPENDENCE SHE HAS BEEN </p><p>ACTIVE IN WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS AND WAS ELECTED SECRETARY FOR </p><p>WELFARE AND TRANSPORTATION IN THE ZANU WOMEN\'S LEAGUE. </p><p>SHE FREQUENTLY TRAVELS WITH THE DELEGATIONS LED BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S WIFE.  MAHOFA IS A KARANGA. </p><p> </p><p>87. (U) OPAH MUCHINGURI:  HAS ONLY RECENTLY COME TO </p><p>PUBLIC PROMINENCE.  IN NOVEMBER 1987 SHE WAS ELECTED TO </p><p>A NON-CONSTITUENT PARLIAMENTARY SEAT, AND IN JANUARY </p><p>1988 SHE RECEIVED HER FIRST APPOINTMENT TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS A DEPUTY MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>BEFORE HER ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT SHE WORKED AS A </p><p>PRIVATE SECRETARY TO PRIME MINISTER MUGABE.  MUCHINGURI </p><p>JOINED THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE WHEN SHE LEFT HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>IN 1975.  SHE RECEIVED TRAINING IN SECRETARIAL SKILLS </p><p>AND ACCOUNTING AND SERVED AS THE SECRETARY FOR THE ZANLA </p><p>HIGH COMMAND.  AFTER INDEPENDECE SHE WORKED BRIEFLY IN </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE BEFORE LEAVING IN 1981 FOR </p><p>STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  SHE GRADUATED FROM </p><p>MINNESOTA STATE IN 1983 WITH A DEGREE IN  PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY EARNED A MASTER\'S DEGREE </p><p>IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AT USC.  SHE RETURNED TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN JANUARY 1986 AND TOOK UP A POSITION IN THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE.  MUCHINGURI IS SAID TO BE VERY </p><p>CLOSE TO MUGABE.  SHE IS A MANYIKA. </p><p> </p><p>88. (C) MUCHINGURI ESSENTIALLY DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT </p><p>FOR THE FOUR YEARS THAT SHE WAS A STUDENT IN THE US. </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT SHE DELIBERATELY LEFT </p><p>THE COUNTRY BECAUSE SHE WAS A SURVIVOR OF THE AUTOMOBILE </p><p>ACCIDENT WHICH KILLED ZANLA COMMANDER JOSIAH TONGONGARA </p><p>IN 1980.  WHILE THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY RULED THAT </p><p>TONGONGARA\'S DEATH WAS AN ACCIDENT, DOUBTS CONTINUED </p><p>AND SOME FELT THAT MUCHINGURI KNEW MORE THAN HAD BEEN </p><p>TOLD TO THE PUBLIC.  MUCHINGURI KEPT A LOW PROFILE FOR </p><p>THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF AFTER HER RETURN TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>IN 1986.  AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH FAY CHUNG, </p><p>MUCHINGURI\'S STAR HAS BEEN ON THE RISE SINCE HER </p><p>ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT IN NOVEMBER 1987.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT MUCHINGURI\'S RISE IS DUE TO HER REPORTEDLY CLOSE </p><p>PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MUGABE.  WE SUSPECT THAT SHE </p><p>HAS BEEN APPOINTED AS A DEPUTY TO THE MINISTERS OF STATE </p><p>FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS SO THAT SHE CAN SPY ON THIS </p><p>COLLECTION OF ERSTWHILE PARTY LEADERS AND POTENTIAL </p><p>RIVALS TO MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RAWLINGS </p><p></p></div>
