<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS FOR G/TIP, INL, DRL, NEA/RA, AND NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, ELAB, SMIG, ASEC, KFRD, PREF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT: JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Per reftel, Post\'s information for the 2002 </p><p>anti-trafficking in persons report is contained in paras </p><p>below.  Responses are keyed to reftel questions.  Until </p><p>6/1/2003, embassy poc on trafficking issues is PolOff Gregory </p><p>D. LoGerfo.  Subsequent to 6/1/2003 poc will be PolOff James </p><p>Fellows. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. In response to para 16a (reftel): Jordan does not meet the </p><p>definitions contained in the act for a country of "origin, </p><p>transit or destination for a significant number of victims of </p><p>severe forms of trafficking."  According to government, local </p><p>human rights, and international NGO contacts (including the </p><p>Minister of Labor, the International Labor Organization\'s </p><p>regional director, a representative of the Women\'s Forum for </p><p>Human Rights, the European Commission human rights officer in </p><p>Jordan; the former president of the Jordan Society for </p><p>Citizens\' Rights; the human rights consultant for the prime </p><p>ministry and a supervisory prosecutor general with the </p><p>Ministry of Justice) there are no known operations, </p><p>practices, or customs in Jordan - or which are conducted from </p><p>or through Jordan - which conform to the definitions </p><p>contained in section 103 (8) of the act.  Based upon </p><p>familiarity with local human rights conditions and the </p><p>previous accuracy of the sources employed, post believes the </p><p>sources are both adequate and reliable in addressing this </p><p>question. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>PREVENTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  As Jordan is not a country of origin, transit or </p><p>destination for a significant number of victims of severe </p><p>forms of trafficking: </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17b (reftel): The GOJ has never </p><p>formally assigned specific anti-trafficking responsibilities </p><p>to any agency or agencies.  However, as part of Jordan\'s </p><p>overall border security program (which has intensified during </p><p>the year due to various unrelated security concerns), </p><p>security forces, customs officers, and immigration </p><p>authorities closely monitor the flow of people and goods into </p><p>and out of the country. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17c (reftel): There were no </p><p>anti-trafficking information campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17d (reftel): The government has </p><p>continued a number of programs that indirectly discourage </p><p>trafficking by keeping children in schools through grants, </p><p>subsidies, and awareness; by educating local and foreign </p><p>workers about their rights under Jordanian labor laws and by </p><p>promoting women\'s and family rights.  Additionally, Jordan\'s </p><p>socially conservative family culture actively discourages </p><p>women (married or unmarried) from leaving their families in </p><p>search of work in another country. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17e (reftel): As trafficking is a not </p><p>an issue in Jordan, programmatic efforts have been focused </p><p>elsewhere.  However, in the unlikely event that trafficking </p><p>became an issue of national urgency, past government actions </p><p>indicate that Jordan would be able to successfully solicit </p><p>and allocate resources to provide prevention programs. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17f (reftel): There are no </p><p>trafficking-specific programs or relationships between the </p><p>government, NGOs or other elements of civil society. </p><p>However, international agencies such as UNHCR and ICRC report </p><p>the government remains very cooperative in their work efforts. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 17g (reftel) The government has strict </p><p>controls on its Iraqi and Syrian borders and has effective </p><p>joint patrols of its western border with Israel and the </p><p>occupied territories.  Jordan\'s southern border is as well </p><p>effectively controlled.  With the on-going </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict and overall concerns for </p><p>regional stability, Jordan intensified its already tight </p><p>border security regime during the year. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Investigation and prosecution of traffickers </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  In response to para 18a/b (reftel): As Jordan is not, and </p><p>has never historically been, a country of origin, transit or </p><p>destination for a significant number of trafficking victims, </p><p>the government has never had reason to pass a law </p><p>specifically prohibiting trafficking in persons.  However, </p><p>traffickers can be prosecuted through the penal code of 1953, </p><p>which prohibits all forms of slavery.  Additionally, </p><p>according to penal law no. 16 of 1960 (specific provisions </p><p>are outlined below),  prostitution and child prostitution are </p><p>both criminal offenses in Jordan.  Articles no. 305-306 and </p><p>310-318 detail penalties.  Article 305 states that whoever </p><p>banters, jokes, or plays around in an immoral or sexually </p><p>suggestive manner with a child under 15 or a female child </p><p>over 15 without her consent, will be punished with up to one </p><p>year in prison.  Article 306 states that the proposition of </p><p>immoral action or even words of immoral content to a boy or </p><p>girl under 15 years of age is punishable by up to six months </p><p>in prison or a 25 Jordanian Dinar (JD) fine (35 USD). </p><p>Article 310 states that whoever has led or has attempted to </p><p>lead a female under 20 years of age into prostitution will be </p><p>punished by no less than one month and no more than three </p><p>years imprisonment and a 5-50 JD fine (71 USD). The same </p><p>punishment applies for anyone who has led or has attempted to </p><p>lead a boy under 15 to perform homosexual acts.  Article 311 </p><p>states that anyone who threatens or intimidates a female to </p><p>perform illegal intercourse inside or outside the Kingdom </p><p>will be sentenced to one to three years in prison.  Article </p><p>314 states that any guardian of a child between six and </p><p>sixteen years of age who allows his/her child to live in a </p><p>house of prostitution is punishable by up to six months in </p><p>jail or up to a 20 JD fine (28 USD).  The rest of the </p><p>articles detail different prison sentences that range from </p><p>two months to three years depending on the type of </p><p>prostitution-related activity. </p><p> </p><p>- In response to para 18c (reftel): According to Article 292 </p><p>of the penal code, the penalty for rape of a female victim </p><p>under the age of 15 is death, and no less than 7 years </p><p>imprisonment for rape of male victims.  For female victims </p><p>between the ages of 15-18, the penalty is between 5-15 years </p><p>with hard labor (article 294), or 10-15 years with hard labor </p><p>if the perpetrator is a family member or member of the </p><p>religious clergy (article 295).  Any person who has sexual </p><p>intercourse with a female with a physical or mental </p><p>disability will be jailed for not less than ten years with </p><p>hard labor (article 293).  Article 296 makes it punishable by </p><p>jail for anyone to disgrace the honor of men, women or </p><p>children (through unwanted sexual acts without penetration) </p><p>with varying terms of imprisonment depending on the age and </p><p>gender of the victim. </p><p> </p><p>-  In response to para 18L (reftel):  In April 2000, Jordan </p><p>signed ILO Convention 182 concerning the prohibition and </p><p>immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  Jordan ratified the "rights of the child" </p><p>convention in 1991, however it has not yet signed the </p><p>supplemental "sale of children protocol".  In 1976, Jordan </p><p>ratified the convention prohibiting the sale of persons into </p><p>slavery.  As trafficking is not a problem in Jordan, the GOJ </p><p>has not signed or ratified the protocol to "prevent, suppress </p><p>and punish trafficking in persons". </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Protection and assistance to victims </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  As Jordan is not a country of origin, transit or </p><p>destination of significant numbers of victims of trafficking: </p><p> </p><p>In response to para 19b (reftel): The government has not </p><p>found it necessary to allocate budgetary resources for </p><p>programs which provide funding to foreign or domestic NGOs </p><p>for services to victims of trafficking.  The GOJ is in the </p><p>process of establishing a law which will provide relief for </p><p>women who have been physically abused (in any circumstance). </p><p>The details of this law are forthcoming and will be reported </p><p>septel. </p><p> </p><p>In response to para 19f (reftel): The government has not </p><p>designed training programs for officials in how to provide </p><p>assistance to trafficked victims.  There are no </p><p>trafficking-specific training programs or instructions for </p><p>Jordanian diplomats serving in countries that are trafficking </p><p>destinations or transit routes; however, prior to their </p><p>service abroad, all diplomats are required to attend a human </p><p>rights course. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
