THE LEAD ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE AUGUST 5 </p><p>    EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY \'THE SUNDAY </p><p>    MAIL,\' QUOTES MINISTER MOYO AS HAVING CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>    BILL AS "A RACIST PIECE OF LEGISLATION."

THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL SEEMS TO </p><p>    BE A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE FULL OF SOUND </p><p>    THAT SIGNIFY NOTHING. . .THE PEOPLE DON\'T UNDERSTAND </p><p>    HOW A GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS A GENOCIDE IN RWANDA NOW </p><p>    WANTS TO POKE ITS NOSE INTO THE AFFAIRS OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>    THE PEOPLE DON\'T UNDERSTAND HOW A GOVERNMENT THAT IS </p><p>    PLAYING PING PONG WHILE PALESTINIANS ARE BEING GUNNED </p><p>    DOWN BY THE BRUTALITY OF ISRAEL WANTS TO GET INVOLVED </p><p>    IN ZIMBABWEAN MATTERS.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE PEOPLE </p><p>    DON\'T UNDERSTAND HOW A COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT WANT TO </p><p>    APOLOGIZE FOR SLAVERY IN AFRICA, A COUNTRY THAT DOES </p><p>    NOT WANT TO COMPENSATE AFRICA FOR COLONIALISM, YET </p><p>    ASSISTING ISRAEL TO GET COMPENSATION, CAN POKE ITS NOSE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02362  091342Z </p><p>    ON THE AFFAIRS OF ZIMBABWE.  IF THEY DON\'T WANT TO </p><p>    APOLOGIZE TO AFRICA FOR SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM, WHY </p><p>    SHOULD WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY TALK OF </p><p>    DEMOCRACY. . .?  THE BILL IS A RACIST BILL BECAUSE IT\'S </p><p>    TARGETING AFRICAN PEOPLE WHOSE CRIME IS TO SEEK THE </p><p>    RESTORATION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  IT\'S NOTHING </p><p>    BUT A RACIST PIECE OF LEGISLATION. . .AMERICA IS </p><p>    BASICALLY A RACIST COUNTRY.  ITS HISTORY IS A HISTORY </p><p>    OF RACISM, SLAVERY, AND COLONIALISM.  OUR FORMER SLAVE </p><p>    MASTERS CAN NEVER BE OUR LIBERATORS.  THEY CAN NEVER </p><p>    STOP THE THIRD CHIMURENGA, AND IF THEY TRY TO DO SO, </p><p>    THEY WILL CAUSE ANOTHER REVOLUTION. . . .,\' HE SAID." </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
