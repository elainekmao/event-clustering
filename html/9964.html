<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 002017 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, MOPS, EAIR, PREL, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA\'S NO SHOOT-DOWN POLICY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolMil Officer Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5 (a) and ( </p><p>b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Following the April 14 downing of a civilian </p><p>aircraft carrying cocaine in Honduras, we have met with </p><p>senior Guatemalan military officials to confirm that the GOG </p><p>has a strict policy against firing on civilian aircraft </p><p>believed to be transporting narcotics and to ensure that they </p><p>understand that the shootdown of drug laden civilian aircraft </p><p>would not/not help the GOG get recertified as a cooperating </p><p>partner on the war on drugs.  Senior GOG military officials </p><p>at every level assured us that the necessary safeguards are </p><p>in place.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The April 14 shoot down by the Honduran Air Force of a </p><p>civilian aircraft carrying narcotics raised our concern that, </p><p>in the GOG\'s interest in obtaining USG counternarcotics </p><p>"recertification," some in the Guatemalan military may have </p><p>considered relaxing their strict rules against shooting down </p><p>suspect aircraft.  The Ambassador instructed MilGroup and DAO </p><p>to engage the Guatemalan military at the highest levels to </p><p>restate our policy against shootdowns, and to make it clear </p><p>that violations of it would be devastating in the USG\'s </p><p>evaluation of GOG counter-narcotics cooperation. </p><p>Furthermore, a shootdown would lead to the immediate </p><p>suspension of USG information sharing on potential narcotics </p><p>flight tracks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The USG Military Group Commander met separately with </p><p>Minister of Defense Moran, Army Chief of Staff Rios Sosa and </p><p>Air Force Commander Hasse to deliver this message.  The </p><p>senior GOG military leaders assured us that the GOG has firm </p><p>guidelines in place to ensure that a shootdown will not </p><p>happen, and that they fully understood our message that a </p><p>shootdown would kill rather than help "recertification" </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The DATT met with the MOD again in July to reinforce </p><p>our concerns about the possibility of an "accidental" </p><p>shootdown.  The MOD assured DATT that strict guidelines had </p><p>been issued, that in no case will the Guatemalan Air Force </p><p>fire warning shots at civilian aircraft.  He further </p><p>indicated that the only situation in which Air Force pilots </p><p>were authorized to use their weapons was in self defense </p><p>after being fired upon. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
