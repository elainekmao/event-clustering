<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000953 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, NP, CH, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: CHINA\'S AMBASSADOR CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION TO HELP NEPAL FIGHT MAOISTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  "International cooperation" was needed to </p><p>deal with Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency, China\'s Ambassador to </p><p>Nepal told Ambassador at a May 8 dinner.  China would provide </p><p>moral support and assistance in this effort, Ambassador Wu </p><p>Congyong said, but consistent with its policy of </p><p>non-interference in other countries\' internal affairs, China </p><p>was confident that Nepal could solve its own problems.  Wu </p><p>expressed concern about the spread of Maoist violence </p><p>throughout Nepal, saw little hope for a negotiated </p><p>settlement, and predicted a prolonged conflict.  New Delhi </p><p>should prevent the Maoists from using Indian territory.  Wu </p><p>explained China\'s official term for the insurgents: </p><p>"anti-government forces."  On May 10 Wu spoke out publicly </p><p>against the Maoists for the first time, repeating to the </p><p>press the points he made to Ambassador May 8.  The Chinese </p><p>seem shocked by the worsening crisis and have signaled that </p><p>they want to be part of the solution to Nepal\'s problems. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>China Stresses International Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) "International cooperation" was needed to address the </p><p>problem of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal, Chinese Ambassador </p><p>to Nepal Wu Congyong has told us.  At Wu\'s invitation, </p><p>Ambassador and Emboffs dined at the Chinese Embassy May 8. </p><p>Wu emphasized that China would provide "moral support and </p><p>assistance within its means" to help the government of Nepal </p><p>deal with the Maoists, but did not specify what form this aid </p><p>would take.  Social reforms would also be needed to address </p><p>the root causes of the insurgency, Wu added.  China\'s goal </p><p>was to ensure Nepal\'s peace, stability and security. </p><p>Moreover, Wu continued, China\'s policy of non-intervention in </p><p>other countries\' internal affairs also applied to Nepal, and </p><p>China considered that Nepal could solve its own problems. </p><p>The same evening Ambassador briefed Wu on USG policy towards </p><p>Nepal, plans to assist the GON, and Prime Minister Deuba\'s </p><p>May 7 Oval Office meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Chinese See Worsening Situation, Grim Prospects </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wu expressed concern that the security situation in </p><p>Nepal has worsened and that the violence has spread from </p><p>remote areas to the Kathmandu Valley.  Furthermore, of late </p><p>Maoist violence has become increasingly intense.  When the </p><p>Ambassador replied that such violence could not be tolerated, </p><p>Wu agreed.  Wu commented that security problems have </p><p>prevented more Chinese tourists from visiting Nepal.  (Note: </p><p>China and Nepal recently completed a bilateral tourism </p><p>agreement designating Nepal as an approved destination for </p><p>Chinese tour groups.  Two Chinese construction project </p><p>workers have been injured as a result of the conflict in </p><p>Nepal, one in February 2001, and the other in April of this </p><p>year, both in Sindhupalchowk district north of Kathmandu. </p><p>Both were employees of the same project.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Wu judged prospects for a negotiated settlement to be </p><p>poor.  Nepal\'s government called on the Maoists to lay down </p><p>their arms, but this is unlikely.  At the same time, the </p><p>Maoists set out three conditions for talks, but these are not </p><p>acceptable to the GON.  The current situation will likely go </p><p>on for a long time, Wu predicted. </p><p> </p><p>India Needs to Crack Down </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Discussing New Delhi\'s role in the conflict, Wu said </p><p>that it would be good if India could prevent the Maoists from </p><p>using Indian territory.  Wu noted that the open border </p><p>between Nepal and India made it easy to smuggle arms and </p><p>logistical supplies as well as to move personnel back and </p><p>forth. </p><p> </p><p>Will the Real Maoists Please Stand Up </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Wu explained that as a matter of policy China did not </p><p>refer to Nepal\'s insurgents as "Maoists" (Chinese: Maopai), </p><p>but rather as "anti-government forces" (Ch: fan zhengfu </p><p>shili).  The insurgents had "usurped" the name of Chinese </p><p>leader Mao Zedong, Wu insisted.  (Note:  Although he took </p><p>pains to explain his government\'s preference for the latter </p><p>term, in conversation the Chinese Ambassador - a Japan hand </p><p>who speaks little English - more often than not referred to </p><p>the insurgents as "Maopai."  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Chinese Speak Out Against Maoists </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Two days after hosting Ambassador and Emboffs, </p><p>Ambassador Wu for the first time spoke out publicly against </p><p>the Maoists.  Press reports quote him as stating, "we condemn </p><p>the violence and terrorist acts unleashed by anti-government </p><p>forces in Nepal."  (Note:  The Chinese Ambassador was </p><p>speaking at a May 10 event launching his Embassy\'s website: </p><p>www.chinaembassy.org.np.  His public comments tracked with </p><p>those he made at the March 8 dinner.  End Note.)  In Wu\'s </p><p>public statement he also said that "the Chinese government </p><p>consistently opposes terrorism in any form and upholds </p><p>international cooperation to combat terrorism," and "the </p><p>independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Nepal </p><p>should be fully respected and maintained." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Chinese Ambassador seemed genuinely shocked by the </p><p>dramatic increase in the level of Maoist violence in recent </p><p>months.  Watching as a friendly and formerly benign neighbor </p><p>struggles to put down a brutal insurgency is evidently </p><p>discomfiting, as is the prospect of another hot spot in South </p><p>Asia and instability on the Tibet border.  Cognizant of </p><p>increased coordination between the U.S., U.K. and other </p><p>donors on the response to the insurgency, Ambassador Wu </p><p>invited us over in order to send a clear signal that China </p><p>wants to be part of the solution to Nepal\'s worsening crisis. </p><p> That in recent years contacts between our two embassies have </p><p>been sparse and intermittent underlines the significance of </p><p>Wu\'s overture. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
