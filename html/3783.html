<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON PALESTINIAN ISSUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers published today, September </p><p>23, focuses on recent developments in the Palestinian </p><p>issue.  Story highlights Israel\'s "stranglehold" on </p><p>Arafat and the destruction of buildings within his </p><p>headquarters complex.  Stories also highlight the </p><p>Palestinian people\'s demonstrations in support of </p><p>Arafat, in what some papers called "the new Intifada," </p><p>crediting the demonstrations for bringing </p><p>international pressure on Israel to halt its actions. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>--"The dangers in the `Bush doctrine\'" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (09/23) editorializes:  "As the Middle </p><p>East has yet again been ignited by the brutality </p><p>unleashed by Ariel Sharon, the inadequacy of </p><p>Washington\'s Middle East policy is underlined by the </p><p>devastation and bloody violence raging in the West </p><p>Bank.  The world has been almost unanimous in </p><p>condemning the latest Israeli aggression against </p><p>Palestinian President Yaser Arafat.  But only a mild </p><p>call for `restraint\' has so far come from Washington. </p><p>The Bush administration has at best shied away from </p><p>the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, when it has not </p><p>blatantly supported Sharon\'s policies.  After </p><p>September 11, Bush . only read the Mideast conflict in </p><p>the language of the `war on terror\', unable to </p><p>identify the root causes of the problem.  His `vision\' </p><p>for a two-state solution lacked a vital element: a </p><p>strategy.  The `Bush doctrine\' is essentially a </p><p>security doctrine.  And a threat to international law. </p><p>The Security policy of the Bush administration is </p><p>based on preemptive military strikes against any </p><p>perceived enemy.  Today it is Iraq.  Who is next?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The tables will turn" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/23) editorializes:  With arrogance, the Sharon </p><p>government continues its crazy war against Palestinian </p><p>legitimacy, and with aggression and racism, Israel\'s </p><p>war machine destroys the presidential headquarters and </p><p>opens fire on the Palestinian people.  Instead of </p><p>weakening President Arafat and the legitimate </p><p>Palestinian leadership, the outcome was different. </p><p>The tables have turned.  What the Palestinian cities </p><p>witnessed over the past two days was as good as a </p><p>referendum about the Palestinian leadership, a vote in </p><p>favor of Palestinian legitimacy and a rejection of the </p><p>U.S-backed Israeli plans of aggression.  It is a </p><p>national responsibility for Arabs to adopt a more </p><p>effective move to put a stop to the new aggression and </p><p>its objectives." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The `Bush Palestinian state\' trick </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(09/23):  "We are watching the collapse of the </p><p>Palestinian Authority under the duress of Israeli </p><p>weaponry that is strongly backed by American policies. </p><p>What Sharon\'s tanks are destroying is not only the </p><p>Oslo accords, but also the foundations of peace that </p><p>were established in the Madrid conference.  President </p><p>Bush\'s talk about a Palestinian state to exist next to </p><p>the Israeli state must not fool anyone.  Sharon\'s </p><p>right-wing government did not respect the interim Oslo </p><p>accords, let alone Bush\'s Palestinian state. </p><p>Destroying the Palestinian Authority does not mean </p><p>opening the road to Bush\'s Palestinian state.  It </p><p>rather holds a plan to legalize the Zionist occupation </p><p>and settlements, to reject the establishment of a </p><p>Palestinian state over Palestinian soil, and to turn </p><p>the Palestinian issue into a game played by the two </p><p>Israeli parties, who both believe in the transfer and </p><p>the establishment of a Palestinian state outside </p><p>Palestine." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
