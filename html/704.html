<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 020091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  UNITED KINGDOM:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 286744 </p><p> </p><p>1.   FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY INPUT FOR THE UK PORTION OF </p><p>THE 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED </p><p>TO QUESTIONS POSED IN PARA 3 REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.   PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES ACTIVELY TO PROSECUTE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>     PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND ULSTER </p><p>     LOYALIST TERRORIST GROUPS FOR ATTACKS IN NORTHERN </p><p>     IRELAND AND GREAT BRITAIN BEFORE THEIR CEASEFIRES </p><p>     ON SEPTEMBER 1 AND OCTOBER 14 RESPECTIVELY.  WE </p><p>     HAVE NOTED AT LEAST 17 PROSECUTIONS IN ENGLAND IN </p><p>     1994, AS WELL AS AT LEAST 100 IN NORTHERN IRELAND. </p><p> </p><p>--   THREE PROBABLE PKK TERRORISTS WERE CONVICTED IN </p><p>     AUGUST FOR FIREBOMBS IN LONDON IN NOVEMBER 1993. </p><p> </p><p>--   DESPITE INTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>     NO ARRESTS AS YET FOR THE MARCH SERIES OF PIRA </p><p>     MORTAR BOMBS AT HEATHROW, OR THE BOMBINGS OF THE </p><p>     ISRAELI EMBASSY AND A JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER IN </p><p>     LONDON IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   EXTRADITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG HAS BEEN EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE IN EXTRADITING </p><p>     SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (MOST ASSOCIATED WITH PIRA) TO </p><p>     THE U.S. FOR TRIAL.  FURTHER INFORMATION IS </p><p>     AVAILABLE FROM FBI HQ IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG ALSO EXTRADITED TWO ENGLISH WOMEN TO FACE TRIAL </p><p>     IN OREGON FOR CONSPIRACY TO MURDER A STATE ATTORNEY </p><p>     IN 1986 IN CONNECTION WITH THE BHAGWAN SRI RAJNEESH </p><p>     COMMUNE, DESPITE INTENSE OPPOSITION FROM BRITISH </p><p>     HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES TO SEEK EXTRADITION FROM THE U.S. OF </p><p>     FOUR PIRA MEMBERS WHO ESCAPED FROM THE MAZE PRISON </p><p>     IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1983.  A COURT IN CALIFORNIA </p><p>     REFUSED EXTRADITION OF THE FIRST OF THESE, JAMES </p><p>     SMYTH, BUT AN APPEAL IS UNDER CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN FEBRUARY, THE IRISH HIGH COURT REFUSED TO </p><p>     EXTRADITE JOSEPH MAGEE, WANTED FOR THE 1992 MURDER </p><p>     OF A BRITISH ARMY RECRUITING SERGEANT. </p><p> </p><p>--   PKK LEADER KANI YILMAZ, ARRESTED IN LONDON IN </p><p>     OCTOBER, IS RESISTING EXTRADITION TO GERMANY ON </p><p>     ARSON CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>4.   SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES, JURORS AND WITNESSES HAS </p><p>     BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  AS </p><p>     A RESULT, TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE ARE </p><p>     CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES (IN "DIPLOCK COURTS"), AND </p><p>     THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES MAY BE WITHHELD FROM THE </p><p>     DEFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>--   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF CONFESSION AND </p><p>     FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN TRIALS OF IRA SUSPECTS IN </p><p>     ENGLAND IN THE 1970\'S CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE </p><p>     PROSECUTORS NOT TO BRING CASES TO TRIAL UNLESS THE </p><p>     EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING, AND MAKE JURORS RELUCTANT </p><p>     TO CONVICT.  CURRENT COURT GUIDELINES ENABLE A </p><p>     JUDGE, AT HIS DISCRETION, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE TO </p><p>     THE DEFENSE OF ALL EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE </p><p>     CASE, WHETHER OR NOT INTENDED FOR PROSECUTION USE. </p><p>     POLICE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE CASES IN </p><p>     WHICH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS MIGHT THUS BE </p><p>     COMPROMISED. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN RECENT YEARS, PIRA HAS TRAINED ITS MEMBERS TO </p><p>     REFUSE TO ANSWER ANY POLICE QUESTIONS, THEN SPRING </p><p>     A SURPRISE ALIBI AT TRIAL; THIS HAS RESULTED IN </p><p>     ACQUITTALS BEFORE POLICE WERE ABLE TO REFUTE THE </p><p>     ALIBI.  IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED </p><p>     LEGISLATION (IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1988, IN GREAT </p><p>     BRITAIN IN 1994) ENABLING A JUDGE TO DIRECT THE </p><p>     JURY THAT IT MAY DRAW AN INFERENCE OF GUILT FROM </p><p>     REFUSAL TO ANSWER REASONABLE QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--   WIRETAP EVIDENCE IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN TRIALS IN THE </p><p>     UK, SINCE WIRETAPS DO NOT REQUIRE JUDICIAL REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>5.   RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUED TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN </p><p>     TRYING TO PERSUADE LIBYA TO SURRENDER FOR TRIAL THE </p><p>     TWO SUSPECTS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 AND </p><p>     THE 1989 BOMBING OF UTA 772. </p><p> </p><p>--   BRITISH OFFICIALS COOPERATED WITH U.S. AND </p><p>     ARGENTINE AUTHORITIES IN INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING </p><p>     OF A JEWISH CENTER IN BUENOS AIRES. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONDEMNED PALESTINIAN ATTACKS IN ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE </p><p>     PROTECTION TO AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE, AND TO DEMAND </p><p>     THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT LIFT THE THREAT TO HIS </p><p>     LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>6.   MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG AND THE IRISH GOVERNMENT COOPERATED IN APPLYING </p><p>     PRESSURE TO PIRA AND LOYALIST TERRORISTS TO ACCEPT </p><p>     THE DECEMBER 1993 DOWNING STREET DECLARATION AND </p><p>     CEASE TERRORISM.  SINCE THE CEASEFIRES, BRITISH </p><p>     OFFICIALS HAVE ENTERED INTO EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE </p><p>     WITH THE PARAMILITARIES, AND SOME RESTRICTIONS ON </p><p>     THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN </p><p>     LIFTED. </p><p> </p><p>--   POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>     CONTINUED TO CRACK DOWN ON LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN </p><p>     PROTECTION, FRAUD, SMUGGLING, MONEY-LAUNDERING AND </p><p>     VIDEO PIRATING RACKETS, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAIN </p><p>     SOURCES OF INCOME FOR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE UK PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>     COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING ITS ACTIVITIES </p><p>     CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AND OTHERS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES </p><p>     COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE TO </p><p>     NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTS ON A BILATERAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>7.   HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR ANY </p><p>     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND </p><p>     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING </p><p>     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE </p><p>     TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES TO RESIST PRESSURE FROM OTHERS IN </p><p>     EUROPE TO RESTORE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH STATE </p><p>     SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.  IT HAS NO MISSION IN </p><p>     BAGHDAD, TRIPOLI OR PYONGYANG, AND ONLY A SKELETON </p><p>     STAFF IN TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>--   SEVERAL GROUPS AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>     ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN OFFICES IN THE UK, AND ARE </p><p>     PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL AND FUNDRAISING </p><p>     ACTIVITIES AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT VIOLATE BRITISH </p><p>     LAWS, BUT ARE CLOSELY MONITORED. </p><p> </p><p>8.   STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993 IN THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   APART FROM ITS LIMITED DIALOGUE WITH PARTIES </p><p>     AFFILIATED WITH REPUBLICAN AND LOYALIST </p><p>     PARAMILITARY GROUPS SINCE THEIR CEASEFIRES, THERE </p><p>     HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN HMG\'S ADAMANT OPPOSITION TO </p><p>     TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROWE </p><p></p></div>
