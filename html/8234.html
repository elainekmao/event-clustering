<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ZAGREB 001164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PHUM, PHUM, HR, HRPGOV, OSCE, Political Parties/Elections, Minorities </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS </p><p>FAIL -- PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 995 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01164  01 OF 03  231059Z </p><p>1.  (C) ELECTIONS FOR CROATIA\'S NEW LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS </p><p>WERE HELD ON MAY 18, BUT THE TURNOUT WAS SO LOW THAT THE </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE BROADLY JUDGED TO BE A TOTAL FAILURE.  THERE IS </p><p>ENOUGH BLAME ON ALL SIDES TO GO AROUND.  THE GOVERNMENT SET </p><p>AN UNREALISTICALLY SHORT -- BUT LEGAL -- DEADLINE, FAILED TO </p><p>EDUCATE POTENTIAL VOTERS ADEQUATELY AND DID NOT TAKE STEPS TO </p><p>UPDATE A "DISASTROUSLY" OUTDATED VOTER REGISTRY.  MINORITIES </p><p>WERE WARNED OF UPCOMING ELECTIONS WELL IN ADVANCE, BUT THOSE </p><p>GROUPS WHICH CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE DID LITTLE TO PREPARE AND </p><p>REMAIN DISORGANIZED.  THE OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO HOLD REPEAT ELECTIONS </p><p>WHERE COUNCILS WERE NOT SEATED, BUT SUCH A REPEAT ELECTION </p><p>WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE LAW.  THE ELECTIONS COMMISSION </p><p>HAS DELAYED RELEASE OF THE RESULTS, BUT PRELIMINARY VOTER </p><p>TURNOUT DATA SHOW THAT, IN SOME DISTRICTS, OBSERVERS </p><p>OUTNUMBERED VOTERS.  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT THE </p><p>ELECTIONS WERE LAWFUL AND THAT COUNCILS SHOULD BEGIN TO </p><p>FUNCTION IN REGIONS WHERE ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE.  IN A MAY 21 </p><p>MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOC TO ENSURE GREATER PARTICIPATION BY </p><p>MINORITIES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MAY 18 MINORITY ELECTIONS -- WHERE WERE THE VOTERS? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL </p><p>MINORITIES (CLNM) CALLED FOR ELECTIONS OF LOCAL-LEVEL </p><p>"MINORITY COUNCILS" IN ALL MUNICIPALITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS (SEE REFTEL FOR DETAILS).  SINCE </p><p>EACH MINORITY COMMUNITY MAY ELECT ITS OWN COUNCIL (PROVIDED </p><p>IT MAKES UP ENOUGH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01164  01 OF 03  231059Z </p><p>MUNICIPALITY), FULLY 470 COUNCILS COULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED. </p><p>140 COMMUNITIES WITH TOO FEW MINORITIES FOR A COUNCIL WERE </p><p>ELIGIBLE TO ELECT SINGLE REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE UP REGIONAL </p><p>MINORITY COUNCILS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN LESS THAN HALF OF THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES ELIGIBLE AND VOTER TURNOUT IN ALMOST ALL AREAS </p><p>WHERE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WAS SO LOW AS TO BE LAUGHABLE.  IN </p><p>ONE DISTRICT, ONLY THREE VOTERS TURNED OUT TO CAST BALLOTS </p><p>FOR A FIVE-CANDIDATE LIST, A TURNOUT OF 0.13 PERCENT. </p><p>MINORITIES BLAME THE GOVERNMENT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FIELD </p><p>LISTS OF CANDIDATES IN TIME TO MEET THE SHORT DEADLINE. </p><p>CROATIA\'S ETHNIC ITALIAN LEADERS CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE </p><p>ELECTION.  IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, MINORITIES EITHER LACKED </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO REGISTER AS CANDIDATES OR WERE NOT </p><p>ORGANIZED ENOUGH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PUT TOGETHER A </p><p>CANDIDATE LIST.  IN A MAY 19 PRESS STATEMENT, THE OSCE </p><p>MISSION IN CROATIA EXPRESSED "CONCERN" AT THE LOW VOTER </p><p>TURNOUT AND CALLED FOR NEW ELECTIONS TO BE ORGANIZED IN </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THEY WERE NOT HELD. </p><p> </p><p>ETHNIC SERB POLITICIANS FOCUS ON RIVALRY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MILORAD PUPOVAC, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA\'S SERB NATIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL (AND ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATIC </p><p>SERB PARTY - SDSS), TOOK PAINS TO DESCRIBE TO US HIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO LOCAL-LEVEL MINORITY </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  HE AGREED THAT TURNOUT WAS DISMAL, BUT WOULD </p><p>PRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSTITUTE COUNCILS WHERE LAWFUL </p><p>ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE.  SINCE THE LAW PREVENTED POLITICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01164  01 OF 03  231059Z </p><p>PARTIES FROM SUBMITTING CANDIDATE LISTS, PUPOVAC\'S POSITION </p><p>ON THE SERB NATIONAL COUNCIL GAVE HIM AND HIS SDSS UNIQUE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OVER RIVAL ETHNIC SERB POLITICIANS IN CAMPAIGNING </p><p>FOR MINORITY COUNCILS.  PUPOVAC TOLD US THAT ONE INDIRECT </p><p>GOAL OF THE CLNM IN CREATING LOCAL COUNCILS WAS TO GIVE LOCAL </p><p>COMMUNITIES MORE OF A VOICE IN MINORITY AFFAIRS.  HE AGREED </p><p>THAT OUTSIDE OF A SMALL, POLITICALLY ACTIVE ELITE, MOST </p><p>MINORITIES ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN </p><p>CROATIA.   MILAN DUKIC, PRESIDENT OF THE SERB INDEPENDENT </p><p>PARTY (SNS - RIVAL TO PUPOVAC\' SDSS) WAS NOT ABLE TO MOBILIZE </p><p>VOTERS TO TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS, AND SO DISPARAGED THE </p><p>ELECTIONS AS A "CHARADE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PUPOVAC TOLD US HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>DECISION TO SET THE ELECTION DATE WAS LEGAL, BUT POINTS OUT </p><p>THAT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN LEGAL TO SET THE DATE NEARLY A </p><p>MONTH LATER.  FURIO RADIN, WHO REPRESENTS THE ITALIAN </p><p>MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT AND ALSO CHAIRS ITS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMMITTEE, DECLARED TO THE PRESS THAT THE LOW TURNOUT MADE </p><p>THE ELECTION A "FAILURE" AND CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>HOLD NEW ELECTIONS WITH MORE REASONABLE LEAD TIME AND WITH </p><p>GREATER EFFORTS TO EDUCATE POTENTIAL VOTERS.  OTHER ETHNIC </p><p>LEADERS HAVE OPENLY SPECULATED THAT RADIN\'S OPPOSITION TO </p><p>THESE ELECTIONS HAS BEEN MOTIVATED IN PART BY HIS CONCERN </p><p>THAT THE NEW COUNCILS COULD DISPLACE WELL-ESTABLISHED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5738 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01164  02 OF 03  231100Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------6A0199  231100Z /38 </p><p>R 231042Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0290 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 001164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, OSCE, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS </p><p>FAIL -- PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND </p><p> </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS OF CROATIA\'S ETHNIC ITALIANS. </p><p> </p><p>NGO: POLLING PROPER, BUT VOTER REGISTERS A "DISASTER" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GONG, THE HIGHLY-REGARDED CROATIAN NGO WITH LONG </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN MONITORING ELECTIONS IN THE REGION, SENT OUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01164  02 OF 03  231100Z </p><p>TEAMS OF OBSERVERS TO 48 POLLING PLACES.  WE MET WITH VLATKA </p><p>SVEDRUZIC, WHO COORDINATED GONG\'S EFFORTS AND ALSO EXECUTED A </p><p>MODEST VOTER-INFORMATION CAMPAIGN SPONSORED BY THE OSCE </p><p>MISSION IN CROATIA.  SVEDRUZIC SAID THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>POLL WAS PROPER IN ALL RESPECTS, BUT NOT ALL POLLING PLACES </p><p>WERE OPEN.  LOCAL OFFICIALS MADE TIMELY ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT </p><p>WHICH POLLS WOULD BE OPEN, BUT THERE WAS CONFUSION AMONG </p><p>VOTERS NONETHELESS.  CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO POLLING </p><p>PLACES WAS APPROPRIATE, AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES WERE DISBURSED </p><p>TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE POLL.  THE BIGGEST TECHNICAL </p><p>PROBLEM WAS OUTDATED VOTER REGISTERS WHICH SVEDRUZIC TERMED A </p><p>"DISASTER."  DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH DISTRICTS HAD A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MINORITY COMMUNITY TO WARRANT A LOCAL </p><p>COUNCIL WERE MADE BASED ON THE 2001 CENSUS.  BUT THIS </p><p>INFORMATION DID NOT MATCH VOTER ROLLS, SINCE INFORMATION IN </p><p>THE CENSUS ABOUT ETHNICITY IS CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL.  VOTER </p><p>ROLLS ARE ONLY UPDATED BEFORE A MAJOR ELECTION, SVEDRUZIC </p><p>EXPLAINED, AND THE CURRENT LISTS DATE FROM PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS IN JANUARY 2000, AND THEREFORE DO NOT INCLUDE MANY </p><p>FORMER REFUGEES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SVEDRUZIC DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>EDUCATE VOTERS AS "MINIMAL."  CANDIDATE LISTS WERE PUBLISHED </p><p>IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE </p><p>ELECTIONS WERE MADE ON THE RADIO.  GONG RAN A MODEST </p><p>GET-OUT-THE-VOTE CAMPAIGN WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA.  SVEDRUZIC SAID THAT THERE WERE </p><p>NEARLY AS MANY REASONS FOR LOW TURNOUT THERE ARE DISTINCT </p><p>ETHNIC COMMUNITIES IN CROATIA.  SOME SERB POLITICIANS SAW THE </p><p>ELECTION AS A CHANCE TO SCORE POINTS AGAINST THEIR RIVALS. </p><p>CZECHS AND HUNGARIANS HAVE NO ORGANIZATION WITHIN THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01164  02 OF 03  231100Z </p><p>ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.  ITALIANS CHOSE TO BOYCOTT.  BOSNIAKS ARE </p><p>WELL-ORGANIZED, BUT SINCE THEY WERE ONLY DESIGNATED AS AN </p><p>OFFICIAL "NATIONAL ETHNIC MINORITY" WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>CLNM IN DECEMBER, THEY HAD TO CHANGE THEIR ETHNICITY STATUS </p><p>AT THE POLLING PLACE.  (NOTE: BOSNIAK TURNOUT WAS STRONGER </p><p>THAN ANY OTHER MINORITY GROUP, BUT WAS STILL RELATIVELY LOW.) </p><p> SVEDRUZIC SAID THEY MET WITH ROMA REPRESENTATIVES, BUT </p><p>BECAUSE SO MANY OF CROATIA\'S ROMA ARE ILLITERATE, THE </p><p>INFORMATION HANDOUTS DISTRIBUTED WOULD BE OF LIMITED USE. </p><p> </p><p>EXPLAINING LOW TURNOUT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ROMAN MESTROVIC, AN SDP MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE, TOLD US THAT HE EXPECTED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE THE LION\'S SHARE OF THE BLAME FOR THE </p><p>"TOTAL FAILURE" OF THE ELECTION, BUT THERE IS "PLENTY OF </p><p>BLAME FOR ALL."  MESTROVIC BELIEVES IT WOULD BE BEST TO THROW </p><p>OUT ALL OF THE ELECTION RESULTS.  THE MAY 18 EXERCISE SHOULD </p><p>SERVE AS AN "EDUCATION" AND, WITH TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE </p><p>LAW, THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD SCHEDULE NEW ELECTIONS TO TAKE </p><p>PLACE CONCURRENTLY WITH EITHER PARLIAMENTARY OR LOCAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  MATO ARLOVIC, SDP VICE PRESIDENT AND CHAIR OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEM </p><p>COMMITTEE, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE LOW TURNOUT IS ACTUALLY A </p><p>"GOOD RESULT" FOR CROATIA, SINCE IT MEANS MANY MINORITIES ARE </p><p>CHOOSING THE "CIVIC OPTION" OF IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS </p><p>CROATIAN CITIZENS BROADLY AND NOT AS MEMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL </p><p>ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY PM: POLL WAS LEGAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01164  02 OF 03  231100Z </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN A MAY 21 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC AGREED THAT LOW TURNOUT WAS A PROBLEM </p><p>AND AGREED THAT THE GOVERNMENT, IN HINDSIGHT, SHOULD HAVE </p><p>PICKED THE LONGER TIMELINE.  HE DEFENDED THE LEGALITY OF THE </p><p>SHORT DEADLINE, AND SAID THAT MINORITIES SHOULD SHOULDER SOME </p><p>OF THE BLAME FOR THE ELECTIONS\' FAILURE.  MINOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHORTCOMINGS IN PREPARING THE POLL HAD NO EFFECT ON VOTER </p><p>TURNOUT, ASSERTED SIMONIC, WHICH WAS MAINLY DUE TO </p><p>OBSTRUCTION BY OR DISORGANIZATION AMONG CROATIA\'S MINOIRTY </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS.  HE SAID HIS PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT PART OF THE </p><p>REASON FOR THE LOW TURNOUT WAS A "GENTLEMAN\'S CONSPIRACY" BY </p><p>MINORITY ORGANIZATIONS WHICH BELIEVE THEY STAND TO LOSE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SUPPORT, BOTH FROM THE STATE BUDGET </p><p>AND, IN THE CASE OF ITALIANS, FROM ABROAD WHEN THE NEW </p><p>COUNCILS ARE FORMED.  PM RACAN\'S CABINET WOULD MEET SOON TO </p><p>DISCUSS A WAY FORWARD ON THE ISSUE, AND HE SPECULATED THAT </p><p>CHANGES TO THE LAW ON LOCAL ELECTIONS COULD BE PUSHED THROUGH </p><p>TO MAKE POSSIBLE REPEAT ELECTIONS IN THOSE DISTRICTS WHERE </p><p>THEY DID NOT TAKE PLACE.  HOWEVER, A MAY 22 GOC PRESS </p><p>STATEMENT INSISTED THAT THE POLL WAS LEGAL, THE TURNOUT WAS </p><p>IN THE RANGE OF WHAT IT EXPECTED, AND THAT THE RESULTS WOULD </p><p>STAND. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5739 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01164  03 OF 03  231100Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------6A019B  231100Z /38 </p><p>R 231042Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0291 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 001164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, OSCE, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS </p><p>FAIL -- PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR: YOU NEED TO DO BETTER </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.
