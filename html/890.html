<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 133614 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 7/L6/2OO7 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, MASS,  PTER, EG, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH BIN LADEN GROUP AMERICAN BUSINESS </p><p>AFFILIATE </p><p> </p><p>1.   CLASSIFIED BY NEA/ENA DIRECTOR, RICHARD L. JACKSON. </p><p>REASONS 1.5  (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) SUMMARY: TECHMASTER ENGINEERING, INC. (TEL), A US- </p><p>AFFILIATE OF A HOLDING COMPANY OF THE BIN LADEN GROUP HAS </p><p>BEEN ENGAGED IN ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER </p><p>FMF-FUNDED CONTRACTS FOR THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS.   TEL CLAIMS IT WAS BANNED FROM COMPETING FOR NEW </p><p>EGYPTIAN MILITARY CONTRACTS ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE INSTRUCTIONS IN MARCH 1996.   THE BUSINESSMEN </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE BAN MAY BE THE OUTGROWTH OF CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE BIN LADEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH TERRORIST OSAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN.   HOWEVER, THEY WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE BAN IS </p><p>NOT THE RESULT OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY OR OF A PRIOR TEL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY IN EGYPT.   THEY ASKED </p><p>THAT WE CHECK AND,  IF POSSIBLE, LET THEM KNOW THE SOURCE OF </p><p>THE MISUNDERSTANDING.   IF THE PROHIBITION IS INSOLUBLE, TEL </p><p>WILL PLAN TO REFOCUS ITS COMMERCIAL EFFORTS.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) FOLLOWING THEIR ATTENDANCE AT AMBASSADOR WALKER\'S </p><p>ADDRESS TO THE US-ARAB CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THIS MORNING, </p><p>WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE BIN LADEN GROUP  (AND </p><p>RETIRED FSO)  PHIL GRIFFIN AND VICTOR PIETKIEWICZ, VP OF </p><p>TECHNASTER ENGINEERING INC. (TEI), OF NEW JERSEY  (A BIN </p><p>LADEN AFFILIATE) MET WITH DESK OFFICER KELLY, NEA/ENA </p><p>DEPUTY PHILO DIBBLE AND JEFF DONALD,  FROM E/CBA. </p><p>PIETKIEWICZ REQUESTED THE MEETING TO DISCUSS HIS BUSINESS </p><p>CONCERNS IN EGYPT.   TEL, HE EXPLAINED, IS A USG(DSAA)- </p><p>QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR WHICH HAS BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THE </p><p>GOE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.   THEY ARE CURRENTLY BIDDING ON </p><p>$60 MILLION IN PENDING GOE TENDERS AND HAVE BEEN LISTED AS </p><p>A BIDDER FOR A WAREHOUSE DEPOT  (3 BUILDINGS) FOR THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) RECENTLY, PIETKIEWICZ CONFIDED, HE LEARNED FROM A </p><p>CONTRACTS FACILITATOR AT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS THAT </p><p>THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY IS BACKING OFF DOING BUSINESS WITH </p><p>TECHMASTER.  PIETKIEWICZ NOTED THAT HE HAD OBTAINED A COPY </p><p>OF AN OFFICIAL GOE MEMO DATED MARCH 1996, STATING THAT THE </p><p>26TH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE UNIT HAD DETERMINED THAT TEI MAY </p><p>NOT ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR ANY NEW MILITARY CONSTRUCTION </p><p>PROJECTS IN EGYPT  (NFI).  WE DID NOT SEE THIS LETTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) AT THIS POINT, GRIFFIN ADDED THAT AT ABOUT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, HE HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI CONCERNING THE BIN </p><p>LADEN FAMILY AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN. </p><p>FOLLOWING THAT DISCUSSION, HE SAID,  IN APRIL 1996, HE </p><p>FACILITATED A MEETING BETWEEN HASSAN BIN LADEN AND THE FBI. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) PIETKIEWICZ SAID HE HAD EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY BOTH IN CAIRO AND IN THE EMBASSY </p><p>(EPO)  IN WASHINGTON.  HE WAS THEREFORE PERPLEXED BY THE </p><p>CHANGE OF HEART IN DEALING WITH HIS COMPANY.   HE HAD NO </p><p>BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE GOE.   HE OPINED </p><p>THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING DUE TO HIS </p><p>COMPANY\'S EARLIER AGENCY RELATIONSHIP WITH  (RET.GEN.) </p><p>MOHAMED EL SHERBINI, CEO OF THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING GROUP </p><p>IN EGYPT.   IT SEEMS THAT SHERBINI ALSO REPRESENTED SEACOR, </p><p>A COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN BANNED FROM DOING BUSINESS IN </p><p>EGYPT,  HE CLAIMED, DUE TO A "FAILED PROJECT".  ANOTHER </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT CAME TO MIND WAS THAT THE GOE HAS MISTAKEN </p><p>HIS COMPANY FOR ANOTHER COMPANY BY THE SAME NAME. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) WHILE GRIFFIN NOTED "AT TIMES" SOME OF THE BIN </p><p>LADEN FAMILY ARE HARASSED UPON ENTRY IN EGYPT, HE ADMITTED </p><p>THAT OTHER BIN LADEN AFFILIATE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>OPERATING IN EGYPT, WITHOUT RESTRICTION.   WHILE TECHMASTER </p><p>ENGINEERING IS BANNED FROM NEW CONTRACTS WITH THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>MILITARY, THIS BAN DOES NOT TO THEIR UNDERSTANDING APPLY TO </p><p>NON-MILITARY ENDEAVORS, NOT TO ON-GOING MILITARY CONTRACTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) PIETKIEWICZ EXPLAINED THAT HIS PRINCIPAL CONCERN AT </p><p>THIS POINT IS NOT TO TURN THE TIDE, BUT TO RECONFIGURE HIS </p><p>FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IF </p><p>THE BAN ON TECHMASTER IS NOT REVERSIBLE. WHILE HE PREFERS </p><p>TO DEAL WITH THE CERTAINTY OF EGYPTIAN MILITARY </p><p>PROCUREMENT, HE NEEDS TO BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT HIS BUSINESS </p><p>DEALINGS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) COMMENT:  EMBASSY MAY WISH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE </p><p>WHICH WE CAN PASS ALONG TO PIETKIEWICZ IF THIS APPEARS TO </p><p>BE A CASE OF MISTAKEN  (CORPORATE) IDENTITY OR IF EL  - </p><p>SHERBINI OR SEACOR HAVE IN SOME WAY TAINTED THE BUSINESS </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR TEI.   IF, AS IT APPEARS TO US, THE BAN ON </p><p>TEL HAS TO DO WITH EGYPTIAN SECURITY CONCERNS, WE WILL </p><p>REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING A SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE TO </p><p>PIETKIEWICZ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
