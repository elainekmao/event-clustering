<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 01177 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: THE REGIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  IRAQI MORALE IS AT A LOW POINT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>IRAQIS REMAIN AS WEARILY DETERMINED AS EVER NOT TO </p><p>LOSE THE WAR.  SEVERAL RECENT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS -- </p><p>RENEWED POPULAR ARMY RECRUITING, THE EX POST FACTO </p><p>CANCELLATION OF AN AMNESTY FOR DESERTERS, AND THE </p><p>BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE -- ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THIS DIP.  EROSION OF LIVING STANDARDS THROUGH </p><p>INFLATION REMAINS A SERIOUS LONG TERM PROBLEM.  THE </p><p>RECENT MISSILE EXCHANGE HAS ADDED TO CIVILIAN FEARS. </p><p>IT HAS ALSO GIVEN A BOOST TO THE MORALE OF SOME TO </p><p>SEE IRAQ ABLE TO STRIKE BACK AT TEHRAN, BUT THIS </p><p>POSITIVE EFFECT WILL DISSIPATE IF THE EXCHANGE </p><p>CONTINUES VERY LONG.  OFFICIAL BRAVADO IS A RESULT </p><p>OF LOCAL MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO BOOST SAGGING </p><p>HOME-FRONT MORALE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE OPINION OF THE AMBASSADOR, CIVILIAN MORALE </p><p>IN BAGHDAD IS CURRENTLY LOWER THAN AT ANY TIME DURING </p><p>HIS THIRTY-NINE MONTHS AT POST.  WHILE THE QUESTION </p><p>MAY NOT BE CRITICAL FOR IRAQ, SINCE IRAQIS SOMEHOW </p><p>DO AND MUST KEEP ON WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES IN THE </p><p>FACE OF OFFICIAL COMPULSION AND POSSESS A GENUINE </p><p>IF WEARY DETERMINATION NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY A </p><p>DESPISED IRANIAN REGIME, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN </p><p>IS MORE ANGUISHING NOW THAN IN RECENT MEMORY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE IRAQIS, MUCH OF THE ADDED </p><p>BURDEN ON MORALE IS DUE DECISIONS AND MISCALCULATIONS </p><p>BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>-- 1) A MAJOR REAPPEARANCE OF POPULAR ARMY PRESS GANGS </p><p>AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A YEAR.  ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE </p><p>REGIME IS RAISING UNITS TO REPLACE KURDISH TRIBAL </p><p>IRREGULAR UNITS DOING GARRISON AND REAR-AREA PATROL DUTY, </p><p>SINCE THESE UNITS ARE CONSIDERED EVEN LESS RELIABLE </p><p>IN THE WAKE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION </p><p>OF KURDISH VILLAGES.  (THE STREET RUMOR IS THAT </p><p>THREE-FOURTHS OF THE NEW PA FORCES WILL GO NORTH TO </p><p>KURDISTAN;ONE FOURTH TO GUARD PIPELINE.)  MIDDLE-AGED </p><p>BAGHDADIS REALLY FEAR DUTY IN KURDISTAN, EXPECTING </p><p>TO HAVE THEIR THROATS CUT IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. </p><p>ANOTHER EXPLANATION IS THAT AFTER A YEAR OF RECRUITING </p><p>INACTIVITY, MANY PA UNITS ARE DUE TO BE DEMOBILIZED </p><p>AFTER THEIR FOURTEEN MONTHS DUTY PERIOD AND MUST NOW </p><p>BE REPLACED WHOLESALE. </p><p> </p><p>-- 2) THE EX POST FACTO CANCELLATION BY SADDAM OF THE </p><p>LAST AMNESTY DECLARED IN JANUARY.  MANY IRAQIS </p><p>ACCUSE THE REGIME OF LURING DESERTERS IN TO SENTENCE </p><p>THEM TO PRISON AND SOME TO EXECUTION.  THIS PERCEIVED </p><p>DOUBLE-DEALING HAS HARMED THE REGIME\'S ALREADY POOR </p><p>CREDIBILITY WITH ITS OWN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- 3) THE BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE CANCELLED IN </p><p>LATE FEBRUARY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S CHARACTERISTIC </p><p>FAILURE TO EXPLAIN ITSELF AND THE POPULATION\'S USUAL </p><p>PENCHANT FOR WILD RUMORS IN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF </p><p>RELIABLE INFORMATION SOWED REAL PANIC, WITH RUMORS OF </p><p>IMPENDING NUCLEAR ATTACK, CHEMICAL WARFARE, AND FLOODING </p><p>DUE TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE SADDAM TIGRIS DAM NEAR </p><p>MOSUL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A LONGER TERM SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR IRAQIS REMALNS </p><p>THE STEADY EROSION OF THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING </p><p>THROUGH STEADY INFLATION IN THE FACE OF A NINE-YEAR </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAGE FREEZE AND THE DRAFTING ONE AFTER </p><p>ANOTHER OF WORKING MALE FAMILY MEMBERS.  A HIGH </p><p>GOVERNMENT MONTHLY SALARY OF 250 DINARS (800 DOLLARS </p><p>AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, 125 AT THE BLACK MARKET AND </p><p>REAL VALUE RATE) BUYS LITTLE WHEN MEAT ON THE BONE </p><p>COSTS NINE DINARS A KILO AND A KILO OF FRUITS OR </p><p>VEGETABLES TWO TO THREE DINARS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ONE NOTICEABLE RESULT OF THESE CURRENT PRESSURES </p><p>HAS BEEN THE GROWING NUMBER OF BAGHDADIS MOVING THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES OUT OF THE CITY OR MAKING ALTERNATIVE </p><p>EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ELSEWHERE. </p><p>THE EVACUATION EXERCISE AND THE LATEST MISSILE EXCHANGE </p><p>WITH IRAN HAVE ACCELERATED THIS TREND.  (THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S NEAREST NEIGHBOR, ONE OF IRAQ\'S RICHEST </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, HAS DECAMPED TO MOSUL AND POORER PEOPLE </p><p>ARE TRYING TO MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES ELSEWHERE.)  WE DO </p><p>NOT EXPECT ANY WHOLESALE FLIGHT, BUT TRAFFIC IN BADHDAD </p><p>IS CURRENTLY NOTICEABLY LIGHTER THAN USUAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT </p><p>OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE WILL BE.  FOR MANY, IF NOT </p><p>MOST, IT HAS MEANT FEAR.  OTHERS ARE PLEASED TO SEE </p><p>IRAQ AT LAST ABLE TO RESPOND IN KIND AND IN FORCE TO </p><p>PREVIOUS IRANIAN SCUD ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD AND HOPE IT </p><p>WILL FRIGHTEN IRAN FROM FURTHER ATTACKS.  IF, AS WE </p><p>WOULD EXPECT, IRAN RESPONDS INSTEAD WITH MORE SCUDS, </p><p>THESE LATTER PEOPLE WILL LIKELY LOSE THIS OPTIMISTIC </p><p>INTERPRETATION.  FINALLY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>INCLUDING A NORMALLY PACIFIC MFA SOURCE, ARGUE THAT </p><p>IRAQ SHOULD ENCOURAGE A MAJOR IRANIAN ATTACK SINCE THE </p><p>IRAQI ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER, ITS MORALE BETTER, </p><p>WHILE THE IRANIANS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MOBILIZING. </p><p>WE PUT THIS VIEW DOWN TO OFFICIAL BRAVADO ARISING OUT </p><p>OF A RESURGENCE OF IRAQI MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO </p><p>COMBAT SAGGING HOME-FRONT MORALE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
