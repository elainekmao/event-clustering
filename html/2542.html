<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/02 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PHUM, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE ELECTORAL DEVELOPMENTS, MORE UNCERTAINTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00556  01 OF 02  020823Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 543 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  IN ADDITION TO THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>DECISION STRIKING DOWN ELECTORAL LAW AMENDMENTS </p><p>(REFTEL), THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND OTHER </p><p>ELECTORAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PAST 48 HOURS.  A HIGH </p><p>COURT JUDGEMENT ON DUAL NATIONALITY AND A SUPREME COURT </p><p>RULING ON VOTING BY CONSTITUENCIES HAVE CLARIFIED THESE </p><p>ISSUES, ALTHOUGH IT IS PROBABLY TOO LATE IN THE PROCESS </p><p>TO HAVE ANY PRACTICAL EFFECT.  JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>CHINAMASA CONFIRMED OUR ANALYSIS (REFTEL) THAT HE </p><p>INTENDS TO RUN THE ELECTIONS AS HE WISHES, COURT RULINGS </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING.  THE CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE </p><p>ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION\'S (ESC) FAILURE TO </p><p>RELEASE THE LIST OF POLLING PLACES, WHICH IN TURN WOULD </p><p>TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THE NAMES OF POLLING AGENTS AND </p><p>PRESIDING OFFICERS.  THE EMERGING "CHAOS" AROUND THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS IS BEING ORCHESTRATED BY THE GOZ TO </p><p>FAVOR ZANU-PF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>2.  (C) A HIGH COURT RULING AND A SUPREME COURT RULING </p><p>HAVE CLARIFIED TWO ISSUES THAT HAVE DOGGED THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR MONTHS.  THE HIGH COURT </p><p>RULED PROVISIONALLY ON THE CONTROVERSIAL DUAL </p><p>NATIONALITY ISSUE, WHICH HAS FORCED THOUSANDS OF DUAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00556  01 OF 02  020823Z </p><p>NATIONAL ZIMBABWEANS TO RENOUNCE ONE OR THE OTHER OF </p><p>THEIR HOMELANDS.  (THE OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY CHARGED </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF ENGINEERED THIS INITIATIVE TO </p><p>DISENFRANCHISE SEVERAL MILLION POTENTIAL VOTERS WHO ARE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS WITH ROOTS IN NEIGHBORING </p><p>COURTRIES, OR SETTLERS OF NON_AFRICAN ANCESTRY.)  THE </p><p>HIGH COURT EXTENDED THE ALREADY PASSED DEADLINE FOR </p><p>RENUNCIATION BY SIX MONTHS, AN INTERIM RULING THAT </p><p>PRESUMABLY WOULD BE WELCOMED BY THE MDC.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED A HIGH COURT RULING </p><p>THAT COMPELLED THE REGISTRAR GENERAL (RG) TO COMPILE A </p><p>NATIONAL LIST AND PERMIT NATIONAL, RATHER THAN </p><p>CONSTITUENCY LEVEL, VOTING FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  SCORE ONE FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>CHINAMASA SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) IN AN EXTENDED LIVE INTERVIEW ON ZBC TELEVISION </p><p>EVENING NEWS, JUSTICE MINISTER CHINAMASA CONFIRMED OURS </p><p>SUSPICIONS THAT HE WILL FORGE AHEAD ON ELECTORAL </p><p>PLANNING AS HE CHOOSES, AND DAMN THE COURTS.  CHINAMASA </p><p>STATED, ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT MORE OBLIQUELY, THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WILL EMPLOY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES TO RUN THE ELECTION </p><p>ALONG THE SAME LINES ENVISAGED BY THE AMENDED ELECTORAL </p><p>ACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>THE CATCH 22 POLLING STATION CONUNDRUM </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, AS </p><p>REPORTED BY THE EU, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE ESC MORE OR </p><p>LESS STATED THAT THE ESC IS EMPOWERED BY LAW TO PUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00556  01 OF 02  020823Z </p><p>POLLING STATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED.  BY LOGICAL </p><p>EXTENSION, THEY MAY ALSO REMOVE THEM FROM WHERE THEY ARE </p><p>NOT WANTED.  HE WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT </p><p>POLLING STATION NUMBERS WILL BE REDUCED IN MDC </p><p>STRONGHOLDS AND INCREASED IN ZANU-PF TERRITORY, BUT THIS </p><p>APPEARS TO BE THE CASE.  IT IS THUS FAR IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>SAY, SINCE NEITHER THE RG NOR ESC HAVE RELEASED A LIST </p><p>OF DESIGNATED POLLING PLACES.  THIS IN TURN HAS </p><p>PREVENTED ANYONE FROM OBTAINING NAMES OF POLLING AGENTS </p><p>AND PRESIDING OFFICERS, EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING PROGRESS ON </p><p>PLANNING WHERE AND HOW TO DEPLOY INTERNATIONAL/LOCAL </p><p>MONITORS AND POLITICAL PARTY AGENTS ON THE VOTING DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>5.  (C) WE ARE INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT THE RECENT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF A CAREFULLY </p><p>ORCHESTRATED SCHEME TO OBSCURE THE ELECTIONS BENEATH A </p><p>VEIL OF DISORDER AND UNCERTAINTY.  THE HIGH COURT RULING </p><p>ON DUAL NATIONALITY MEANS NOTHING, ONE WEEK AWAY FROM </p><p>THE VOTE, SINCE THE VOTER ROLLS ARE PRESUMABLY CLOSED </p><p>FOR THOSE PROBABLE MDC SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE THEORETICALLY </p><p>RECEIVED A JUDICIAL REPRIEVE FROM DISENFRANCHISEMENT. </p><p>THE CONSTITUENCY DECISION IS MORE OF A TWO-EDGED SWORD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8470 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00556  02 OF 02  020823Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------6E5D2E  020823Z /38 </p><p>O 020812Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1077 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/02 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE ELECTORAL DEVELOPMENTS, MORE UNCERTAINTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00556  02 OF 02  020823Z </p><p> </p><p>AND THUS HARDER TO COMPREHEND FROM THE ZANU-PF </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  IT WOULD SEEM TO BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO </p><p>DISCOURAGE INTIMIDATED AND DISLOCATED MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>FROM RETURNING TO VOTE IN THEIR HOME CONSTITUENCIES, BUT </p><p>IT WOULD ALSO SERVE TO COMPLICATE ZANU-PF ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>BRING IN OUTSIDERS TO VOTE IN CONSTITUENCIES OTHER THAN </p><p>THEIR OWN.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE GOZ HAS SET THE </p><p>STAGE TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS TO TILT THE VOTE AS MUCH </p><p>AS POSSIBLE IN FAVOR OF ZANU-PF WHILE ATTEMPTING, </p><p>THROUGH THE FOG OF CONFUSION, TO MAINTIAN A PRETEXT THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE NOT OUTRIGHT STOLEN THE ELECTION.  THE CAT AND </p><p>MOUSE GAME WITH OBSERVERS AND DOMESTIC CSOS CONTINUES, </p><p>WITH ZANU-PF AND CHINAMASA DETERMINING THE RULES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
