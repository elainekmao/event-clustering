<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 07 ANKARA 004552 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR TURKISH FONMIN GUL\'S JULY 24 VISIT </p><p>TO WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 6339 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  F.M. Gul comes to Washington as we try to </p><p>pull Turkey into a more fully helpful role in Iraq.  The last </p><p>year has shaken the confidence of the Turkish public, </p><p>politicians, and military in the strength of the relationship </p><p>with the U.S., just as it has shaken our confidence in the </p><p>Turks.  While we have been able to manage the issue of the </p><p>July 4 incident, it is likely to fester for a long time in </p><p>the minds of many Turks as a humiliation to the military, and </p><p>could thus continue to affect U.S.-Turkey security </p><p>cooperation broadly.  In part, our problems come from </p><p>divergent views on Iraq, particularly the security threat </p><p>from various possible development in northern Iraq.  However, </p><p>in large part they are also a function of Turkish domestic </p><p>politics.  The ruling AK Party is seen as a threat to the </p><p>existing order of Turkey that the military and much of the </p><p>Establishment is trying to defend -- and the military is seen </p><p>as a barrier to the changes AK and others would like to make </p><p>in Turkey.  The relationship with the U.S., the reforms </p><p>needed for the EU and even the range of Iraq issues have been </p><p>approached, frequently, by both sides in the context of the </p><p>relationship between the military/traditional Establishment </p><p>and AK, rather than on their merits.  In reacting to the July </p><p>4 incident, P.M. Erdogan and Gul maintained a measured </p><p>approach, while the TGS, under pressure from military </p><p>hard-liners, refused any responsibility and stirred national </p><p>outrage.  The implications of the internal political dynamic </p><p>for the wider issue of GOT Iraq policy are considerable. </p><p>Civilian authorities would like to complete a transformation </p><p>of Iraq policy away from the historic northern-Iraq centered </p><p>obsession and fear of a Kurdish state -- a change in focus </p><p>that stems in part from efforts by the MFA and other civilian </p><p>authorities to wrestle control over Turkey\'s Iraq policy from </p><p>the Turkish military.  Following on the July 18th visits of </p><p>CMDRUSEUCOM and CMDRUSCENTOCM, we have cooperative </p><p>perspectives for Iraq stabilization force, terror action, and </p><p>greater transparency and liaison before us.  This visit needs </p><p>to reinforce the direction, but we cannot press hard on the </p><p>stabilization force contribution at the risk of being </p><p>counterproductive.  It will also be important to present </p><p>positive and operational response to Turkey\'s offers of </p><p>civilian humanitarian assistance.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Domestic Context </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Gul, Erdogan, and the rest of the AK leadership have </p><p>maintained a measured approach to the incident in Iraq in </p><p>order to protect our bilateral relationship and to press its </p><p>proposed reform package to loosen the TGS\'s grip on Turkish </p><p>policy.  However, to keep their political opponents off </p><p>balance, they have publicly been supportive of the military. </p><p>The hard-liners saw the event as a way to resist AK\'s effort </p><p>and weaken its standing by attacking it as an American </p><p>"supporter."  Thus, the AK stance contrasts starkly with the </p><p>reaction from the military, President Sezer, and opposition </p><p>CHP, all of whom have used the press to castigate both AK for </p><p>being "too soft" and the U.S. for its actions.  After the </p><p>release of the joint statement the Turkish press focused on </p><p>the absence of an apology. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) U.S.-Turkey tensions fit into a complex competition </p><p>between AK and the military. They portray themselves as </p><p>having opposed visions of Turkey\'s future.  Within each group </p><p>there are tensions too.  There are increasing signs of </p><p>discontent among hard-liners in the senior military </p><p>leadership, who are trying to force TGS chief Ozkok into a </p><p>more confrontational stance toward the USG as a way to rally </p><p>nationalism and counter AK.  The difference between the AK </p><p>Government and the Establishment on this front highlights a </p><p>basic gap in Turkey between those -- led in the first </p><p>instance by the military hawks -- who support an order linked </p><p>to a rigid, statist-oriented view of what Ataturk wanted for </p><p>the Republic of Turkey, and those who say they want a more </p><p>open, EU candidacy-linked, conservative Turkey, with greater </p><p>opportunity for Islamic influences, to prevail.  In this </p><p>political competition there are also question marks regarding </p><p>AK\'s: 1) ultimate social, political, and economic intentions </p><p>domestically; and 2) its ability to run a competent </p><p>government and willingness to respond to U.S. interests.  The </p><p>domestic competition is often more important to the TGS or AK </p><p>than the issues being addressed, and many U.S.-Turkey </p><p>questions are dealt with as fodder as much as on their </p><p>merits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Turkish Military </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Contacts in the MFA, press, and among national </p><p>security analysts think the Turkish military misjudged </p><p>Turkey\'s equities in Iraq after the end of operations and </p><p>that TGS\'s efforts to use the Turkmen issue as a wedge </p><p>against U.S. policy was a mistake.  TGS D/CHOD Buyukanit, </p><p>regarded as one of the senior officers pushing a harder line </p><p>against the US during the Iraq war, also admitted that the </p><p>Turkish military had misplayed its hand on Iraq.  While </p><p>arguing that both sides had made mistakes and defending </p><p>(without great conviction) TGS\'s attempts to persuade the </p><p>Parliament to pass the March 1 troop deployment resolution, </p><p>Buyukanit had said -- before the July 4 incident -- that TGS </p><p>was ready to move forward with the U.S.  TGS supported the </p><p>recent Cabinet decree to allow the U.S. and other coalition </p><p>partners to use Turkish bases and ports for operations </p><p>consistent with UNSCR 1483, including a positive response in </p><p>principle to EUCOM\'s request to station up to 10 tankers and </p><p>1 ISR aircraft at Incirlik in support of OEF and OIF </p><p>operations (EUCOM is in the process of reviewing TGS\'s </p><p>operating guidelines for the deployment and stationing of the </p><p>aircraft, but we are taking a slow approach in the wake of </p><p>the detention of TSF in Iraq). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) TGS asserts privately and publicly that it supports </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy and wants to adopt stances on important </p><p>issues (i.e. non-military approach to PKK/KADEK) that would </p><p>help Turkey vis-a-vis the EU.  However, top military officers </p><p>also have recently publicly criticized the EU and taken </p><p>measures to delay EU-related reforms.  Many continue to </p><p>believe that TGS was behind President Sezer\'s recent decision </p><p>to veto an article of the GOT\'s 6th EU-related reform package </p><p>and that the Turkish military will continue to resist all </p><p>efforts by AK to lessen the military\'s control over what it </p><p>considers to be its sacred role in protecting Turkey\'s </p><p>"secular" status and national security interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) On the TGS horizon is the August Supreme Military </p><p>Council (YAS).  Among the four-star ranks, both the Navy and </p><p>Air Force commanders retire this year, as will the commanders </p><p>of the First and Third Turkish Armies, and the National </p><p>Security Council Secretary General.  The YAS could allow </p><p>Ozkok, who is beginning the second year of his four-year tour </p><p>as Chief of the Turkish General Staff, the first real </p><p>opportunity to shape his own leadership team.  Last year, </p><p>contrary to tradition, the outgoing chief made all the </p><p>general officer assignment and promotion selections.  Ozkok, </p><p>however, may be constrained by the hard-liners and other </p><p>traditionalists with whom he is contending on a number of </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Iraq: Signs of a Shift In Policy </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The detention of TSF by the U.S. military in northern </p><p>Iraq on July 4 has raised suspicions on both sides of the </p><p>other\'s intentions.  CDR EUCOM Gen. Jones reiterated our </p><p>concerns to Ozkok July 18; while Ozkok stuck to the TGS </p><p>position on the issue, he added that he would punish any </p><p>"lack of discipline" he found among the TSF elements </p><p>involved; he added that visible cooperation was the best way </p><p>to move ahead.  While letting Gul know we want the matter </p><p>behind us, we should reiterate to him that U.S. forces had </p><p>solid information and found concrete evidence.  We should </p><p>also press for an outcome of the Iraq discussion which </p><p>underscores that the U.S. and Turkey are jointly focused on </p><p>Iraq\'s recovery and democratization country-wide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Turkey\'s civilian authorities would like to complete a </p><p>transformation of Iraq policy away from the historic </p><p>northern-Iraq centered obsession with border security, fear </p><p>of a Kurdish state, and Turkish military presence towards a </p><p>more Baghdad-oriented policy based primarily on trade and </p><p>assistance.  This change in focus, to the extent it has been </p><p>realized, appears to stem in part from efforts by the MFA and </p><p>other civilian authorities to wrestle control over Turkey\'s </p><p>Iraq policy from the Turkish military.  During a recent </p><p>one-on-one with the Ambassador, MFA U/S Ziyal said he had </p><p>asked P.M. Erdogan after the end of combat operations in Iraq </p><p>to transfer authority over the issue of northern Iraq (and </p><p>Iraq) from the TGS to the MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Turks have taken a number of concrete steps in </p><p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction since the </p><p>Secretary\'s April visit to Turkey. Turkey has become a hub </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>for facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance to </p><p>northern Iraq.  The World Food Program has shipped 341,000 </p><p>tons of food through Turkey since March.  Turkey is also the </p><p>world\'s biggest supplier (in value terms) to WFP.  Turkey </p><p>recently allowed an energy barter arrangement organized by </p><p>Delta Petroleum to go forward.  This will enable coalition </p><p>authorities to supply essential energy supplies to the Iraqi </p><p>people.  Indeed, Turkey has an opportunity to build strong </p><p>trade links with Iraq.  During his Washington meetings in </p><p>June, MFA U/S Ziyal raised Turkey\'s interest in building a </p><p>second border crossing to relieve the burden on the Habur </p><p>Gate (now handling some 2000 vehicles daily).  Bottlenecks in </p><p>processing vehicles continue on both sides of the border, </p><p>with the KDP continuing to charge some (including UN) </p><p>vehicles fees and the GOT carefully scrutinizing incoming </p><p>trucks to limit fuel smuggling.  The Turks have applied to </p><p>reestablish THY commercial air links with Iraq when that </p><p>becomes feasible.  We hope that the visit will allow us to </p><p>begin to operationalize further civilian reconstruction </p><p>cooperation as offered by Ziyal that CPA views favorably. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Relations with Iraqi Kurds </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The MFA has portrayed the mid-May visit to Iraq by a </p><p>three-person MFA delegation as improving Turkish-Kurdish </p><p>relations.  The Turkish delegation found both KDP leader </p><p>Barzani and PUK leader Talabani willing to take concrete </p><p>steps to improve relations.  The MFA delegation proposed a </p><p>number of confidence-building measures designed to improve </p><p>relations, including: (1) more equitable and transparent </p><p>duties charged to Turkish businesses crossing the border; (2) </p><p>softening of rhetoric between Kurdish and Turkmen groups in </p><p>Iraq; (3) establishment of Turkish-Kurdish joint ventures in </p><p>the north; and (4) establishment of "one-stop shopping" in </p><p>key northern Iraqi cities for Turkish business groups. </p><p>Barzani reportedly committed in principle to taking steps to </p><p>improve Kurdish-Turkmen relations, but said he could not </p><p>"change course overnight."  He said the KDP would explore </p><p>taking incremental steps toward improving relations, and said </p><p>that that much would depend on the actions of the Turkmen. </p><p>The KDP and PUK leaders also reportedly heeded Turkey\'s </p><p>request to refrain from calling for the end of the Peace </p><p>Monitoring Force and the withdrawal of the Turkish </p><p>participating troops at least until the end of the year to </p><p>give the Turkish military time to "feel more comfortable" </p><p>with the overall security situation on the ground in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The GOT remains concerned about what it perceives to </p><p>be undue Kurdish influence on coalition authorities in </p><p>northern Iraq.  They have strongly objected to coalition </p><p>plans to disarm all groups except the Kurds, which they </p><p>believe gives the Kurds too much power over the other ethnic </p><p>groups, particularly the Turkmen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Turkmen in Iraq </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) While the GOT remains concerned about the fate of </p><p>Turkmen, the frequency and tone of Turkish "complaints" of </p><p>mistreatment of the Turkmen by other Iraqi groups have </p><p>declined significantly.  GOT officials appear to have made a </p><p>conscious decision to change the way they talk about the </p><p>Turkmen.  The nearly daily reports of Kurdish efforts to </p><p>marginalize Turkmen have been replaced by statements about </p><p>the importance of ensuring proportionate representation for </p><p>all Iraqi groups in local and central decision-making bodies. </p><p> The MFA regularly talks about the need for the Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front to become a real political party, to not be seen as a </p><p>tool of Ankara, and to integrate itself into the political </p><p>process in Iraq.  The GOT continues to look to the U.S. to </p><p>help ensure proper Turkmen representation on key leadership </p><p>councils in the north as well as in the IIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PKK/KADEK </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) The Turks remain interested in working with us on </p><p>collaborative planning to address the PKK/KADEK presence in </p><p>the north; TGS Chief Ozkok reiterated this July 18 to CDR </p><p>CENTCOM Gen. Abizaid.  Nevertheless, recent developments </p><p>might complicate the modalities of such cooperation.  The </p><p>GOT\'s draft law to reintegrate PKK/KADEK militants and their </p><p>leadership in exchange for a PKK/KADEK agreement to lay down </p><p>their arms and return to Turkey appears now to have been </p><p>watered down owing to resistance from parts of the military </p><p>and the traditionally hard-line civilian staff of the Turkish </p><p>NSC.  In the wake of widespread press speculation -- fomented </p><p>in the first instance by a well-known conduit for hard-line </p><p>military views -- the MFA has expressed concern to us about </p><p>Iraq Governing Council member Mahmoud Othman\'s alleged </p><p>PKK/KADEK ties.  It is likely that Gul will raise this with </p><p>the Secretary.  We have not uncovered any information </p><p>suggesting his support for PKK/KADEK and have told the GOT to </p><p>share the evidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Stabilization Force for Iraq </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) TGS Chief Ozkok and MFA U/S Ziyal told CDR CENTCOM </p><p>Gen. Abiziad and Gen Jones July 18 that they welcomed the </p><p>chance to begin thinking in earnest about the modalities of a </p><p>Turkish contribution to the Stabilization Force -- in Ozkok\'s </p><p>view, preferably under NATO auspices -- but warned that </p><p>public opinion and politics could make approval difficult. </p><p>Given the sennsitivities involved, we should avoid creating </p><p>the impression with Gul that we are pushing too aggressively </p><p>on this front.  Rather, we need to let the planning process </p><p>move forward towards the right answer from the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Middle East Roadmap </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The GOT wants to use its excellent relations with </p><p>Israelis and the Palestinians as a vehicle for its larger </p><p>ambitions in the region.  P.M. Erdogan told President Bush </p><p>May 14 he would send F.M. Gul to Israel and Palestine "soon;" </p><p>we understand from an AK party deputy chairman that a Gul </p><p>visit is now more front and center given AK\'s recognition of </p><p>the importance of such a visit for Turkey\'s relations with </p><p>the U.S.  TGS CHOD General Ozkok went to Tel Aviv July 3 and </p><p>Israeli President Katzav visited Turkey July 8-9.  Israeli </p><p>F.M. and DefMin have been to Ankara in the last two months as </p><p>well.  An MFA official also has told us the idea of </p><p>supporting Abu Mazen at the expense of Arafat "poses certain </p><p>problems for the AK party and P.M. Erdogan."  We have had </p><p>similar intimations from AK M.P.s.  During his meetings in </p><p>Washington, Gul expects to hear the current status of play </p><p>and Administration views of how Turkey can best contribute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Syria/Iran </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The Turks remain disturbed by what they see as unfair </p><p>criticism from Washington that they are "soft" on Syria and </p><p>Iran.  GOT officials have argued that Washington\'s perception </p><p>that Turkey\'s relations with Syria and Iran was inconsistent </p><p>with USG policy were "totally unfounded" and denied that </p><p>Turkey was pursuing a strategic partnership with either </p><p>country.  The GOT argues that Turkey shares the same values </p><p>and goals in the Middle East as the U.S. (stability, </p><p>democracy and prosperity), and Gul delivered a call for </p><p>democracy and reform in the Islamic world at the June OIC </p><p>Summit in Tehran.  MFA has gone so far as to argue that the </p><p>U.S. message on Syria that we conveyed to FM Gul prior to his </p><p>May visit to Syria was "softer" than the message Gul </p><p>delivered.  Turkey shares our concern about Iranian support </p><p>for terrorists (including the PKK/KADEK) and WMD programs). </p><p>If the GOT\'s perception is accurate and Washington does </p><p>believe that Turkey is "soft" on Syria and Iran, we recommend </p><p>that the Department make clear what Turkish actions have led </p><p>to this conclusion and what Turkey needs to do to prove that </p><p>it shares U.S. concerns and objectives regarding Syria and </p><p>Iran.  Turkey should be cautioned that Iranian </p><p>destabilization tactics in the region will be met with equal </p><p>and appropriate countermeasures and the USG expects its full </p><p>support should events come to this.  On this latter point, </p><p>however, we can expect Gul, who sees Iran as a much tougher </p><p>nut to crack than Iraq, to be ultra-cautious about endorsing </p><p>active measures against Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) IAEA chief Mohammed El Baradei\'s findings as a result </p><p>of his latest visit to Tehran to discuss the capabilities of </p><p>the recently tested Iranian surface-to-surface Shahab-3 </p><p>ballistic missiles is a potential source of worry for both </p><p>the GOT and the US. Turkey shares the USG\'s concerns </p><p>regarding Iran\'s nuclear program, and has fully supported the </p><p>USG in its call for total Iranian compliance with IAEA\'s </p><p>inspection process and safeguard requirements.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Turkey exhibits a preference for appearing to cooperate with </p><p>Iran while, at the same time, seeking to hide behind USG </p><p>cover to constrain Iran\'s nuclear capabilities.  It will be </p><p>important to remind Turkey of the necessity to present a </p><p>public, unified stance regarding Iranian nuclear </p><p>capabilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Cyprus </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Although the AK government has retreated from its </p><p>much more forward-leaning initial approach in the face of </p><p>concerted political pressure from the military, presidency, </p><p>MFA bureaucracy, and "TRNC President" ReDenktash, senior AK </p><p>officials tell us this was a tactical retreat and Erdogan </p><p>intends to solve the problem before Cyprus\'s entry into the </p><p>EU May 1, 2004.  AK owes Denktas nothing politically, and we </p><p>understand that the GOT is willing to use the Annan III Plan </p><p>as the basis for renewed negotiations, but wants adjustments </p><p>on land and the numbers involved in population shifts between </p><p>the two sides.  It would be useful to emphasize to Gul the </p><p>benefits to U.S.-Turkish relations from GOT acceleration of </p><p>the negotiations and a settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Armenia </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) The AK government is much less wedded to Aliyev and </p><p>tying improvement of relations with Armenia to a settlement </p><p>in Nagorno-Karabakh, but remains under sniper fire from </p><p>entrenched anti-Armenian interests.  AK officials tell us </p><p>they recognize the trade and development benefits to Turkey </p><p>from opening the border.  We understand there may be secret </p><p>F.M.-level contacts continuing at this time.  However, AK </p><p>officials have made it clear that passage of any Armenian </p><p>genocide language, even by only one chamber of Congress, will </p><p>set progress back significantly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>EU Candidacy </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Since coming to power in the November elections, the </p><p>ruling AK Party has made EU membership a top priority.  The </p><p>GOT in January adopted two EU-related legislative reform </p><p>packages designed to crack down on torture and remove </p><p>barriers to free expression, association, and fair trial. </p><p>Parliament adopted another package June 19, the sixth package </p><p>in the past two years, and the GOT plans to pass a seventh </p><p>package before a parliamentary recess in August.  Our </p><p>contacts have confirmed press reports that the seventh </p><p>package will be focused on limiting the military\'s political </p><p>influence, including measures that will change the structure </p><p>of the National Security Council.  However, the pro-EU, </p><p>pro-reform AK government faces opposition from nationalistic </p><p>opponents in the bureaucracy and parts of the military.  In </p><p>several instances, bureaucratic institutions have undermined </p><p>reform legislation by developing highly restrictive </p><p>implementing regulations.  For example, Parliament lifted </p><p>restrictions on Kurdish language broadcasting, but the </p><p>subsequent Radio and Television Board regulation set strict </p><p>time limits and restricted such broadcasts to state-owned </p><p>media outlets.  In addition, our European contacts say that </p><p>while the GOT has made impressive legal reforms, Turkey\'s </p><p>standing in the EU has also been undermined by recent actions </p><p>such as the closing of the pro-Kurdish HADEP party and </p><p>indictment of its sister party, DEHAP, and the recent police </p><p>raid of the Human Rights Association\'s Ankara offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Child Custody </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) The Hague Convention on Child Abduction requires the </p><p>expeditious return of a child to its country of residence so </p><p>the courts in that country can decide on custody.  Turkey has </p><p>been a signatory to the Hague Convention since August 2000. </p><p>During that period of time, we are unaware of any children </p><p>being returned to any country without the agreement of the </p><p>abducting parent.  There are systemic problems:  1) Court </p><p>meets for 10 minutes monthly and does not focus on Hague </p><p>issues;  2) judges do not understand the Hague Convention </p><p>requirment and rule on custody rather than Hague issues, </p><p>thereby requiring a lengthy appeal process; 3) the legal </p><p>process lasts between 2-3 years total; and 4) the Ministry of </p><p>Interior does not focus resources on finding the abducted </p><p>child and the parent.  The US currently has four applications </p><p>pending for return of a child to the US.  In one case the </p><p>child has now been in Turkey over a year due to the slow </p><p>court process and the judge used that delay to rule the child </p><p>should stay in Turkey.  In another case, the Government of </p><p>Turkey has been unable to locate a child abducted to Turkey </p><p>in October 2002.  Due to physical abuse by the abducting </p><p>father, the Turkish court ordered the child returned to the </p><p>mother immediately.  The Interior Ministry places a low </p><p>priority on these types of cases and has been unable to </p><p>locate the child. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Human Trafficking </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) We have discussed with the GOT at various levels the </p><p>need to show progress on Trafficking in Persons (TIP) by </p><p>September in order to avoid facing sanctions as a consequence </p><p>of Turkey\'s Tier III ranking in the TIP report.  GOT </p><p>officials have been highly defensive on the issue, insisting </p><p>that the report is unfair and that they are already taking </p><p>adequate measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Article 98 </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) GOT contacts have repeatedly maintained that, in </p><p>principle, they share our concerns about the International </p><p>Criminal Court (ICC) and favor reaching an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with us.  However, given their status as an EU </p><p>candidate country, they believe it is not in their interest </p><p>to sign an agreement until the U.S. and EU resolve their </p><p>differences on the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Economy </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU) The economy is sending mixed signals.  On the one </p><p>hand, there are solid signs of growth and declining </p><p>inflation.  On the other hand, after having rallied strongly </p><p>in the aftermath of the Iraq operation, particularly once the </p><p>USG announced it would provide $1 billion in financial </p><p>assistance, markets have stalled due to the lack of investor </p><p>confidence in the government\'s commitment to reform.  Markets </p><p>are particularly concerned about continuing delays in the </p><p>Government\'s implementation of its IMF-backed reform program. </p><p> As a result, interest rates on the extremely large </p><p>government debt remain high, and the economy remains </p><p>vulnerable to a sharp depreciation of the currency, which </p><p>would put the entire program and economic stability at risk. </p><p>We need to stress the importance of Turkey flawlessly </p><p>implementing its commitments under the IMF-backed program (to </p><p>the IMF).  Disbursement of USD 1 billion in U.S. assistance </p><p>-- which Gul might raise -- is contingent on continued </p><p>implementation of the IMF program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) In June, MFA U/S Ziyal and U/S Larson agreed to </p><p>convene a fall meeting of the Economic Partnership Commission </p><p>(EPC), which was established in early 2002 to find ways to </p><p>enhance the bilateral economic relationship.  The meeting </p><p>will be an opportunity to press a broad economic agenda </p><p>including structural reform, reduction of trade barriers </p><p>improving the investment climate, and enhancing regional </p><p>economic cooperation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
