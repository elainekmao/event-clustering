(D) FBIS GMP20030325000335 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy continues on a normal schedule March 26. </p><p> Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center and Peace Corps remain suspended.  Movements </p><p>for American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  On March 25 Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan </p><p>accused the Government of Jordan of "stopping" the </p><p>importation of oil from Iraq and thus depriving King Abdullah </p><p>of his "reward" from the Iraqi regime (ref A).  Ramadan </p><p>attacked Jordan for expelling its "diplomats," and asked if </p><p>Jordan had not turned into a "front for the US aggression." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Jordanian Minister of Industry and Trade Salah </p><p>Basheer and Minister of Information Mohammed Adwan stated at </p><p>a joint press conference March 25 that the GOJ and King </p><p>Abdullah, had exhausted all possible means to avoid war and </p><p>to come to a peaceful solution.  Basheer said the flow of </p><p>commodities to Iraq from Jordan is "normal" and denied the </p><p>GOJ had "frozen" Iraqi assets in Jordanian banks.  He also </p><p>said the GOJ would allow the three expelled Iraqi diplomats </p><p>to be replaced by new ones.  As for the oil, Adwan said that </p><p>the security issue posed by the "current circumstances" make </p><p>it unsafe for Jordanian truckers to go into Iraq.  He said </p><p>the GOJ has yet to import oil from other countries, but that </p><p>"brotherly Arab countries" had promised to meet Jordan\'s oil </p><p>demand (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In a press conference on March 25, Jordanian Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher stated that "His Majesty King </p><p>Abdullah II continues exerting efforts to stop war on Iraq." </p><p>Commenting on the expulsion of five Iraqi diplomats, Muasher </p><p>said that "the reasons were not an American dictate," adding </p><p>that Jordan is "ready to receive new diplomats."  On the </p><p>subject of Jordanian trade with Iraq, Muasher said that the </p><p>Oil For Food program was stopped due to the departure of UN </p><p>officials from Iraq due to the war, and noted that Jordan is </p><p>urging the UN to set up new measures by which the Oil for </p><p>Food program can be resumed.  (ref C) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri sent a letter to </p><p>Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher March 25, which was </p><p>read by an announcer on Iraqi Satellite Television, noting </p><p>his surprise at the expulsion of five Iraqi diplomats from </p><p>Jordan.  In the letter, Sabri states:  "You know that the </p><p>so-called charges against our embassy employees are pure lies </p><p>and are groundless."  He notes, in particular, that Jordanian </p><p>"intelligence officials escorted First Secretary </p><p>Adb-al-Razzaq Iyad Ahmad in an uncivilized manner from his </p><p>house in Amman and beat him up," adding that "we have no idea </p><p>about his whereabouts."  Finally, he states:  "This action is </p><p>a blatant violation of pan-Arab values and neighborly </p><p>relations between our two countries," and points out "we </p><p>strongly denounce that these measures of yours come in </p><p>implementation of a disgraceful wish."
