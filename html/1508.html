<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA C. PALMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DANISH DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION MISSION </p><p>CONDITIONS FUTURE AGRICULTURE AID ON POSITIVE RESPONSE </p><p>TO MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 488 AND PREVIOUS (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE DANISH UNDER SECRETARY FOR BILATERAL </p><p>COOPERATION, AMBASSADOR CARSTEN STRAU, TOLD CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES ON JANUARY 31 THAT DENMARK\'S CONTINUED </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE DEPENDED ON THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE TO THE LETTER FROM </p><p>UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR MARK </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN TO PRESIDENT MUGABE (REFTEL).  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE RESPONSE TO THE MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER IS SEEN AS A </p><p>KEY INDICATOR OF FUTURE DONOR SUPPORT -- WHETHER FOR </p><p>LAND OR GENERAL DEVELOPMENT.  THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE, NOT TO MENTION ITS TONE AND </p><p>TENOR, WILL PROVIDE A SIGNAL OF INTENT ON ITS "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" LAND REFORM PROGRAM AND WHAT SORT OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>IT WOULD REQUEST OF DONORS.  AN IN-YOUR-FACE RESPONSE </p><p>WILL LEAD TO A HARDER LINE BY DONORS.  IN THE CURRENT </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, EVEN A POSITIVE, CONCILIATORY RESPONSE </p><p>LIKELY WILL BE MET WITH SKEPTICISM AND A "SHOW-ME" </p><p>ATTITUDE.  NO DONOR EXPECTS A ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>ABOUT-FACE. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE DANISH DIPLOMAT SAID HE PUT THAT MESSAGE </p><p>ACROSS TO MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STANISLAUS MUDENGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00620  011428Z </p><p>EARLIER THAT DAY.  THE DANISH PARLIAMENT RECENTLY VOTED </p><p>NO NEW AID FOR ZIMBABWE, AND THE PARTY THAT AMBASSADOR </p><p>STRAU IS LEADING SEEKS TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO LEVERAGE AID </p><p>THAT IS STILL IN THE PIPELINE, DESPITE REDUCED LEVELS. </p><p>DENMARK NO LONGER FUNDS ZIMBABWE\'S MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE; IT USES MONIES REMAINING FROM THAT PROGRAM </p><p>TO SUPPORT "COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES" TO THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  ALL OTHER DANISH AID </p><p>NOW GOES TO NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, BUT FUNDS </p><p>FOR HIV/AIDS AND OTHER HEALTH PROJECT ASSISTANCE REMAIN </p><p>AT NORMAL LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) STRAU TOLD US THAT MUDENGE DID NOT RECITE THE </p><p>HISTORY OF THE LAND QUESTION IN ZIMBABWE OR TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVILE THE BRITISH, </p><p>SOMEWHAT TO HIS SURPRISE.  RATHER, THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER REASONABLY PROBED THE EXTENT OF THE </p><p>DANISH AID CUTBACK AND CONDITIONS FOR ITS RETURN TO </p><p>PREVIOUS LEVELS.  THE DANISH DIPLOMAT STRESSED TO THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER THAT THAT WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON </p><p>WHETHER VIOLENCE WAS EMPLOYED IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE SORTS OF TACTICS </p><p>EMPLOYED IN THE FAST-TRACK LAND REDISTRIBUTION EXERCISE. </p><p>THERE WAS PROVISION TO SCALE BACK AID LEVELS EVEN </p><p>FURTHER.  HE URGED THE MINISTER TO ENTER INTO A ROBUST </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON LAND REFORM, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, IN ORDER TO </p><p>SECURE A SETTLEMENT THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL.  DENMARK, </p><p>HE NOTED, HAD PLACED ZIMBABWE IN A CATEGORY OF COUNTRIES </p><p>NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR ITS STANDARD FIVE-YEAR AID </p><p>PROGRAM.  STRAU\'S GOVERNMENT WILL MONITOR PROGRESS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00620  011428Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS BEFORE CONSIDERING </p><p>RESUMING NORMAL ASSISTANCE LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: THE DANES HAVE A LARGE BILATERAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN ZIMBABWE AND, AS A RESULT, ARE </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY INFLUENTIAL WITH ITS GOVERNMENT.  WE </p><p>HAVE HEARD THAT MUDENGE PRIVATELY EXPRESSED BITTERNESS </p><p>AT THE DANES\' CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD HIS GOVERNMENT, </p><p>GIVEN THEIR TRACK RECORD OF GENEROSITY AND POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE RULING ZANU-PF WHEN IT WAS A LIBERATION </p><p>MOVEMENT.  THE DANES HAVE SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS AND </p><p>THEIR VIEWS ON THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S CONDUCT OF </p><p>THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE HEW CLOSELY TO </p><p>OUR OWN.  WHETHER STRAU\'S MESSAGE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S FINAL RESPONSE TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S CONDITIONS FOR HELPING ON LAND REFORM </p><p>REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT HERE </p><p>COULD NOT FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE DANES\' CLARITY AND </p><p>BLUNTNESS.  ALL INDICATORS ARE THAT OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES WILL FOLLOW SUIT -- LED BY SWEDEN, THE CURRENT </p><p>HEAD OF THE 15-NATION EUROPEAN UNION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
