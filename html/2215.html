THE COURT TRIAL BEGAN IN LATE MAY, BUT WAS SUSPENDED </p><p>AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS, </p><p>THE CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL SEEMED UNUSUALLY CONTRIVED WITH THE </p><p>ACCUSED CLAIMING THAT THEY HAD BEEN SCAPEGOATED.

THE AUTHORITIES, ESPECIALLY COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM </p><p>(CPV) GENERAL SECRETARY (GS) NONG DUC MANH, FREQUENTLY </p><p>IDENTIFY CORRUPTION, ALONG WITH RED TAPE AND WASTERFUL </p><p>SPENDING, AS WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS HINDERING NATIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.

IF THE MUONG TE TRIAL IS AN INDICATION, CORRUPTION IS </p><p>PERCEIVED TO RUN WIDE AND DEEP.  SPEAKING AT THE JUST- </p><p>CONCLUDED TRIAL, THE PRESIDING JUDGE COMMENTED, "MANY (MORE) </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, BOTH FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LAI CHAU PROVINCE, </p><p>ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE RECEIVED BIG AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM SON </p><p>AND THIET (TWO OF THE ACCUSED)."  MOST OF THE PRESS AND </p><p>PUBLIC ATTENTION FOCUSED ON HOW THE COURT DEALT WITH THE </p><p>CASES. AFTER DELIVERING ITS VERDICT, THE COURT ANNOUNCED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03080  230932Z </p><p>THAT THE INVESTIGATING OFFICE WOULD CONTINUE ITS </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS. THE COURT ALSO CONFIRMED THAT INVESTIGATING </p><p>OFFICES RECEIVED VND 240 MILLION (USD 1,600) IN RETURNED </p><p>BRIBE MONEY FROM 24 INDIVIDUALS, MANY OF THEM BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>SENIOR STATE EMPLOYEES. DURING THE INVESTIGATION POLICE </p><p>REPORTEDLY FOUND A NOTEBOOK BELONGING TO ONE OF THE ACCUSED </p><p>CONTRACTORS LISTING BRIBES TO 117 OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR, THE VCP PUNISHED 13 MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ETHNIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, INCLUDING MINISTER- </p><p>CHAIRMAN HOANG DUC NGHI AND THREE VICE-CHAIRMEN, FOR </p><p>"WRONGDOINGS".

COMMENT:  THE ATTENTION FOCUSSED ON THE MUONG THE TRIAL </p><p>AND GS MANH\'S RECENT REMARKS SHOW THAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE </p><p>PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO PUBLIC DISCONTENT ABOUT </p><p>CORRUPTION.  THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS AN OPEN QUESTION. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
