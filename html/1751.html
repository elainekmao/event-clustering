<p>UNCLAS       SECTION 01 OF 09 ABUJA 001364 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRL/CRA; DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 66404 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  The following is Embassy Abuja\'s submission for this </p><p>year\'s International Religious Freedom Report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>OLUSEGUN </p><p>OBASANJO ASSUMED OFFICE ON MAY 29, 1999.  THE 1999 </p><p>CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  WHILE THE </p><p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GENERALLY RESPECTED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, IT </p><p>DID NOT ANNUL THE ADOPTION OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A STATUTES BY A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NORTHERN STATES, PREFERRING TO ALLOW </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THESE LAWS </p><p>IN THE COURTS.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKED BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES TO DEFUSE CONFLICTS, BUT THE 36 STATE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>REMAINED THE PRIMARY ACTORS IN THE ARENA OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE STATUS OF RESPECT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DETERIORATED </p><p>DURING THE YEAR, AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXPANDED </p><p>VERSION OF SHARI\'A LAW IN SEVERAL NORTHERN STATES </p><p>INCREASED TENSIONS BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  FOLLOWING ZAMFARA STATE\'S LEAD, SOKOTO, KEBBI, NIGER, </p><p>KANO, KATSINA, KADUNA, JIGAWA, YOBE, AND BAUCHI STATES HAVE </p><p>ALL ADOPTED VARYING FORMS OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A LAW.  ADHERENCE </p><p>TO THE NEW SHARI\'A PROVISIONS IS COMPULSORY FOR MUSLIMS IN </p><p>SOME STATES, AND OPTIONAL IN OTHERS.  THIS REPRESENTS A </p><p>CHANGE FROM PRIOR </p><p>PRACTICE, WHEN SHARI\'A COURTS WERE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR </p><p>PERSONAL LAW MATTERS (MARRIAGE, HEREDITARY CLAIMS, CHILD </p><p>CUSTODY, ETC.) AND CIVIL LITIGATION.  THE SHARI\'A CRIMINAL </p><p>STATUTES DO NOT CRIMINALIZE APOSTASY OR CONVERSION, AND DO </p><p>NOT APPLY TO CHRISTIANS.  AS SUCH, THEY HAVE NOT DIRECTLY </p><p>INHIBITED THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF CHRISTIANS OR MUSLIMS. </p><p>WITH THE ADVENT OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A, MANY NORTHERN CHRISTIANS </p><p>ARE CONCERNED THAT THEIR CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS WILL NOT </p><p>BE ADEQUATELY RESPECTED BY THE MUSLIM MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MUCH OF THE INTER-RELIGIOUS TENSION THAT SURROUNDED THE </p><p>RE-INTRODUCTION OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A IN NORTHERN NIGERIA HAS </p><p>ABATED.  SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS REMAIN, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF MORE EXTREME </p><p>"HADD" PUNISHMENTS OF AMPUTATION AND STONING. </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS TENSION IN SOME NORTHERN STATES HAVE THEIR </p><p>ROOTS IN LONG-STANDING ETHNIC CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE </p><p>PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM HAUSA-FULANI MAJORITY AND A LARGE </p><p>MINORITY OF PREDOMINANTLY CHRISTIAN OR ANIMIST ETHNIC GROUPS </p><p>WITH ROOTS IN THE MIDDLE-BELT AND THE SOUTH.  KADUNA STATE, </p><p>THE LOCUS OF INTER-ETHNIC AND INTER-RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN </p><p>FEBRUARY AND MAY OF 2000 THAT CLAIMED OVER 2000 LIVES, HAS </p><p>MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN INCREASING UNDERSTANDING </p><p>BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM ETHNIC GROUPS.  OTHER STATES, </p><p>SUCH AS ZAMFARA AND GOMBE, HAVE SEEN INTER-RELIGIOUS TENSIONS </p><p>RISE.  SOME GOVERNORS HAVE ENCOURAGED INTER-FAITH AND </p><p>INTER-ETHNIC DISCUSSIONS TO BENEFICIAL EFFECT.  IN NEARLY ALL </p><p>NIGERIAN STATES, ETHNIC RIVALRIES BETWEEN MAJORITY </p><p>"INDIGENES" AND MINORITY "IMMIGRANTS" RESULT IN MINORITY </p><p>ETHNIC GROUPS (OFTEN PRACTITIONERS OF THE MINORITY RELIGION </p><p>IN THAT STATE) SUFFERING SOME DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT AT THE </p><p>HANDS OF THE MAJORITY.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK A </p><p>DECIDELY HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO RESOLVING ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONFLICTS.  THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FRACTIOUS AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY VIOLENT NATURE OF NIGERIAN ETHNIC AND REGIONAL </p><p>POLITICS--BEYOND STOPPING VIOLENCE ONCE IT OCCURS, DIRECT </p><p>INTERVENTION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN IN FACT EXACERBATE </p><p>ETHNIC TENSIONS.  IT RELIES, THEREFORE, ON BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNORS AND PROVIDES DIRECTIVES ON HOW TO </p><p>MITIGATE CONFLICT WHEN IT OCCURS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE EMBASSY IN ABUJA AND </p><p>THROUGH STATEMENTS FROM WASHINGTON EXECUTIVE BRANCH </p><p>SPOKESPERSONS, HAS ADVOCATED PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO </p><p>ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN NIGERIA, AND HAS EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MUST BE RESPECTED IN </p><p>ANY RESOLUTION OF THE SHARI\'A QUESTION.  THE OFFICE OF </p><p>TRANSITION INITIATIVES (OTI) AND USAID HAVE ALSO CREATED </p><p>PROGRAMS FOR CONFLICT-RESOLUTION TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION I.  RELIGIOUS DEMOGRAPHY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, LOCATED IN SUB-SAHARAN </p><p>WEST AFRICA, IS 923,768 SQ. KM. (356,700 SQ. MI.), WHICH </p><p>IS AN AREA ABOUT THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA, NEVADA, AND </p><p>ARIZONA COMBINED.  THE POPULATION IS CURENTLY ESTIMATED </p><p>TO BE 120 MILLION.  THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ACCURATE </p><p>CENSUS FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES AND MANY ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE POPULATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THIS </p><p>OFTEN-CITED FIGURE. </p><p>ABOUT HALF THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION PRACTICES ISLAM, </p><p>40 PERCENT CHRISTIANITY, AND 10 PERCENT </p><p>PRACTICES EXCLUSIVELY TRADITIONAL INDIGENOUS RELIGIONS </p><p>OR NO RELIGION AT ALL; MANY PERSONS COMBINE ELEMENTS OF </p><p>CHRISTIANITY OR ISLAM AND ELEMENTS OF A TRADITIONAL </p><p>RELIGION IN THEIR RELIGIOUS PRACTICE.  THE </p><p>PREDOMINANT FORM OF ISLAM IN THE COUNTRY IS SUNNI, MOST OF </p><p>THEM MALIKIS.  THE CHRISTIAN POPULATION INCLUDES ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLICS, ANGLICANS, BAPTISTS, METHODISTS, AND A GROWING </p><p>NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS OF INDEPENDENT, EVANGELICAL PENTECOSTAL </p><p>GROUPS.  CATHOLICS CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN </p><p>DENOMINATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN MISSIONARY GROUPS OPERATE IN THE COUNTRY AND DO </p><p>NOT FACE RESTRICTIONS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO DETER </p><p>THEIR ACTIVITIES.  MANY MISSIONARY GROUPS HAVE NOTED </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS, OBSTRUCTION, AND ATTEMPTS TO EXTORT </p><p>MONEY FOR THE PROCESSING OF NECESSARY VISAS AND </p><p>RESIDENCE PERMITS FOR FOREIGNERS; HOWEVER, MANY FOREIGN </p><p>BUSINESSES AND OTHER NON-RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS EXPERIENCE </p><p>SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES.  IN DECEMBER </p><p>2000, REINHARD BONNKE, A GERMAN EVANGELIST BASED IN THE </p><p>U.S., VOLUNTARILY CHOSE NOT TO HOLD RELIGIOUS SERVICES </p><p>IN KADUNA BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT HIS PRESENCE COULD </p><p>EXACERBATE RELIGIOUS TENSIONS IN THAT CITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN </p><p>RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND ETHNIC AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY.  THE </p><p>NORTH, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY THE LARGE HAUSA AND FULANI </p><p>ETHNIC GROUPS, IS PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM, WITH SIGNIFICANT </p><p>POPULATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE BELT </p><p>AND URBAN CENTERS.  IN THE SOUTHWEST, WHERE THE LARGE YORUBA </p><p>ETHNIC GROUP IS DOMINANT, THERE IS NO DOMINANT RELIGION. </p><p>BECAUSE OF EXTENSIVE PROSELETYZING BY MUSLIMS DURING THE </p><p>JIHAD OF USMAN DAN FODIO IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, ISLAM IS </p><p>PRACTICED BY A PLURALITY, IF NOT A MAJORITY, IN THE LARGEST </p><p>CITIES OF THE REGION.  MANY YORUBAS PRACTICE ISLAM OR </p><p>CHRISTIANITY, WHILE OTHERS CONTINUE TO PRACTICE THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL YORUBA RELIGION, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH BELIEF IN A </p><p>SINGLE SUPREME DEITY AND THE WORSHIP OF LESSER DEITIES </p><p>BELIEVED TO SERVE AS THE AGENTS OF THAT SUPREME DEITY WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF LIFE.  IN THE EAST, WHERE THE </p><p>LARGE IGBO ETHNIC GROUP IS DOMINANT, CATHOLICS AND METHODISTS </p><p>ARE IN THE MAJORITY, ALTHOUGH MANY IGBOS CONTINUE TO OBSERVE </p><p>TRADITIONAL INDIGENOUS RELIGIOUS PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION II. STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL/POLICY FRAMEWORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE 1999 CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF </p><p>THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION, INCLUDING FREEDOM TO </p><p>CHANGE ONE\'S RELIGION OR BELIEF, AND FREEDOM TO MANIFEST </p><p>AND PROPAGATE ONE\'S RELIGION OR BELIEF IN WORSHIP, </p><p>TEACHING, PRACTICE AND OBSERVANCE.  AS MANY NORTHERN STATES </p><p>HAVE RE-INTRODUCED DIFFERENT FORMS OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A LAW </p><p>DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS MUST BE </p><p>CONSIDERED: (1) DO SHARI\'A CRIMINAL AND ANCILLARY STATUTES </p><p>DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY VIOLATE CHRISTIANS\' FREEDOM OF </p><p>RELIGION; AND (2) DOES THE ADOPTION OF A FAITH-BASED CRIMINAL </p><p>CODE, WHICH DOES NOT PROHIBIT CONVERSION, VIOLATE THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF MEMBERS OF THAT FAITH PER SE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE SHARI\'A STATUTES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ALL NON-MUSLIMS FROM </p><p>THEIR JURISDICTION.  ONE CHRISTIAN HAS BEEN TRIED FOR ASSAULT </p><p>IN A CRIMINAL SHARI\'A COURT AFTER HE VOLUNTARILY CHOSE THAT </p><p>JURISDICTION, APPARENTLY BECAUSE THE PENALTY OF CANING WAS </p><p>LESS ONEROUS THAN THE POTENTIAL PENALTY UNDER COMMON LAW.  DE </p><p>FACTO DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BY STATES AGAINST MINORITY </p><p>RELIGIONISTS--LIMITING ACCESS TO STATE CONTRACTS AND </p><p>STATE-OWNED MEDIA, REFUSING TO GRANT CERTIFICATES OF </p><p>OCCUPANCY TO MINORITY PLACES OF WORSHIP, FAILING TO PROVIDE </p><p>RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION FOR MINORITY RELIGIONISTS IN PUBLIC </p><p>SCHOOLS--PREDATED CRIMINAL SHARI\'A IN THE NORTH, AND ARE </p><p>PREVALENT ELSEWHERE IN NIGERIA.  ANCILLARY LAWS PASSED BY </p><p>SOME NORTHERN STATES OUTLAWING PROSTITUTION, REGULATING THE </p><p>SALE AND CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL AND BARRING MIXED-GENDER </p><p>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, WHILE NOT DIRECTLY LIMITING </p><p>CHRISTIANS\' RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, HAVE NONETHELESS SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>AFFECTED THEM, AS WELL AS MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHETHER CRIMINAL SHARI\'A THAT DOES NOT OUTLAW OR PUNISH </p><p>CONVERSION VIOLATES MUSLIMS\' RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS OPEN TO </p><p>DEBATE.  THE DETERMINATION OF THIS QUESTION SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>AFFECTS WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  ARTICLE 18 </p><p>OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS OF 1948 DEFINES </p><p>FREEDOM OF RELIGION AS THE "FREEDOM TO CHANGE...RELIGION OR </p><p>BELIEF, AND FREEDOM...IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE TO </p><p>MANIFEST...RELIGION OR BELIEF IN TEACHING, PRACTICE, WORSHIP </p><p>AND OBSERVANCES."  THE CRIMINAL SHARI\'A SYSTEMS RE-INTRODUCED </p><p>IN NORTHERN NIGERIA IN THE PAST YEAR DO NOT APPEAR TO VIOLATE </p><p>THIS DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THESE SYSTEMS DO, </p><p>HOWEVER, PROVIDE FOR INHUMAN OR DEGRADING PUNISHMENTS, AND </p><p>THEREFORE HAVE SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS.  HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT SHARI\'A PUNISHMENTS CAN BE </p><p>DISTINGUISHED FROM VIOLATIONS OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF </p><p>ADHERENTS--UNLESS ADHERENTS ARE PROHIBITED BY SHARI\'A FROM </p><p>CHANGING THEIR FAITH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION FORBIDS THE FEDERAL OR ANY </p><p>STATE GOVERNMENT FROM ADOPTING ANY RELIGION AS A STATE </p><p>RELIGION.  AS NIGERIA LACKS AN ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE, BOTH </p><p>STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN RELIGION IN A </p><p>MUCH MORE DIRECT WAY THAN IN THE U.S.   THIS INVOLVEMENT </p><p>INCLUDES MANDATORY RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF EITHER CHRISTIAN </p><p>OR MUSLIM RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE </p><p>OCCASIONAL CONSTRUCTION OF MOSQUES AND CHURCHES USING </p><p>GOVERNMENT FUNDS, AND SUBSIDIZING INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>HAJJ AND PILGRIMAGES TO JERUSALEM, RESPECTIVELY.  SOME STATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED A DESIRE </p><p>TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO EXPRESSLY PERMIT THE ADOPTION </p><p>OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A CODES IN MAJORITY MUSLIM STATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A FEDERAL SHARI\'A COURT OF APPEAL AND FINAL </p><p>COURT OF APPEAL; HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET </p><p>ESTABLISHED SUCH COURTS BY YEAR\'S END.  AS MENTIONED ABOVE, </p><p>SOME STATES HAVE EXPANDED SHARI\'A JURISDICTION TO INCLUDE </p><p>CRIMINAL MATTERS.  THESE COURTS MAY BE USED FOR BOTH CIVIL </p><p>AND CRIMINAL CASES BY MUSLIMS.  IN SOME STATES, SHARI\'A </p><p>CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OVER MUSLIMS IS MANDATORY, WHILE IN </p><p>OTHERS IT IS OPTIONAL.  IN ALL OF THESE STATES, IF A </p><p>CHRISTIAN IS IN A CIVIL DISPUTE WITH A MUSLIM, HE OR SHE CAN </p><p>OPT TO HAVE THE CASE HEARD IN A SHARI\'A, RATHER THAN A COMMON </p><p>LAW COURT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOME CHRISTIANS HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE REINTRODUCTION </p><p>OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A, COUPLED WITH THE CONTINUED USE OF STATE </p><p>REVENUE TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF MOSQUES, TRAINING FOR </p><p>ALKALIS (MUSLIM JUDGES), AND PILGRIMAGES TO MECCA, </p><p>CONSTITUTES THE ADOPTION OF ISLAM AS A STATE RELIGION. </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASANJO IN NOVEMBER 1999 EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT </p><p>THE EXPANDED SHARI\'A PROVISIONS WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT INTERVENE LEGALLY DUE </p><p>TO REGIONAL, ETHNIC AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.  IT HAS </p><p>OPTED TO ALLOW DEFENDENTS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY </p><p>OF SHARI\'A CRIMINAL STATUTES THROUGH THE COURTS.  NO APPEALS </p><p>WITH ADEQUATE LEGAL STANDING HAVE YET MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH </p><p>THE APPELATE SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA JOINED THE ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE </p><p>(OIC) IN 1986 UNDER PRESIDENT IBRAHIM BANBANGIDA.  IT </p><p>HAS RETAINED THAT MEMBERSHIP AND CONTINUED TO SEND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO MEETINGS DESPITE MISGIVINGS THAT THIS </p><p>UNDERMINES THE CONCEPT OF A SECULAR STATE.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>OIC INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SUB-SAHARAN STATES THAT ARE MEBERS </p><p>DESPITE BEING CONSTITUTIONALLY SECULAR AND HAVING </p><p>MINORITY MUSLIM POPULATIONS. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EACH YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECLARES THE FOLLOWING </p><p>ISLAMIC AND CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL DAYS AS </p><p>NATION-WIDE HOLIDAYS: EID-EL-KABIR, EID-EL-FITR, GOOD </p><p>FRIDAY, EASTER MONDAY, EID-EL-MAULUD, AND CHRISTMAS DAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTIAN AND ISLAMIC GROUPS ARE SUPPOSED TO REGISTER </p><p>WITH THE CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION (CAC) WHEN </p><p>BUILDING A NEW CHURCH OR MOSQUE.  THE LAW REQUIRES THAT </p><p>A BOARD OF TRUSTEES BE NAMED, A NOTICE BE PLACED IN </p><p>THREE NATIONWIDE NEWSPAPERS OF THE GROUP\'S INTENT TO </p><p>ORGANIZE, AND TRUSTEE INFORMATION SENT TO THE CAC.  IF </p><p>NO OBJECTIONS ARE RECEIVED, THE GROUP CAN PROCEED WITH </p><p>ITS MEETINGS.  THIS LAW WAS PUT INTO EFFECT IN ORDER TO </p><p>STEM THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW BUILDINGS IN THE ABSENCE </p><p>OF ZONING LAWS, TO RESOLVE LEGAL QUESTIONS ARISING FROM </p><p>DISPUTES OVER CHURCH OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL, TO PROVIDE A </p><p>SINGLE REGISTRY FOR GOVERNMENT REFERENCE IN </p><p>THE EVENT THAT COMPENSATION IS DEMANDED FOLLOWING CIVIL </p><p>DISTURBANCES, AND TO ALLOW FOR LEGAL SOLEMNIZATION OF </p><p>MARRIAGES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION STATES "NO PERSON ATTENDING ANY PLACE </p><p>OF EDUCATION SHALL BE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE RELIGIOUS </p><p>INSTRUCTION OR TO TAKE PART IN OR ATTEND ANY RELIGIOUS </p><p>CEREMONY OR OBSERVANCE IF SUCH INSTRUCTION, CEREMONY, OR </p><p>OBSERVANCE RELATES TO A RELIGION OTHER THAN HIS OWN." </p><p>DESPITE THESE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, PUBLIC </p><p>SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF </p><p>THEIR FAITH, WERE SUBJECTED TO MANDATORY ISLAMIC OR </p><p>CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.  CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION </p><p>OF NIGERIA (CAN) LEADERS HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO PLACE </p><p>TEACHERS OF CHRISTIANITY IN ZAMFARA AND SOKOTO STATE </p><p>SCHOOLS WHERE STUDENTS ALLEGE THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO </p><p>TAKE COURSES IN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO </p><p>GRADUATE. </p><p>GOVERNORS FOR BOTH STATES SAID THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF </p><p>THE PROBLEM BUT WELCOMED THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF </p><p>NIGERIA\'S OFFER OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH QUALIFIED CHRISTIAN </p><p>TEACHERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIKEWISE, THE LACK OF COURSES IN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE </p><p>AND </p><p>THE INABILITY TO CONDUCT MORNING DEVOTIONS IN OYO STATE </p><p>RESULTED IN OVER 1,500 STUDENTS PROTESTING AT STATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN IBADAN ON DECEMBER 5, 2000.  THE </p><p>STUDENTS ALSO ALLEGE THAT THEY WERE BEATEN BY CHRISTIAN </p><p>SEMINARY STUDENTS FROM A NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DURING PROTESTS </p><p>AT THE SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>SECTION III.  RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEF OR ADHERENCE IS NOT REQUIRED FOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES.  HOWEVER, IN </p><p>MAY 2001, TWO MEMBERS OF THE ZAMFARA STATE ASSEMBLY -- IBRAHIM </p><p>MUSA MURAI AND ABDULLAHI MAJIDADI KURYA -- WERE </p><p>SUSPENDED BY THE HOUSE FOR THREE MONTHS FOR NOT </p><p>SUPPORTING BILLS INTRODUCED BY GOVERNOR AHMED SANI. </p><p>THEY WERE ACCUSED OF NOT SHOWING FULL SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>COMPULSORY CLOSING OF BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, AND HOSPITALS </p><p>DURING FRIDAY PRAYERS AND AN ENFORCED ZAKKAT (ALMS) </p><p>PAYMENT TO ASSIST THE NEEDY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF WIDESPREAD RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN </p><p>FEBRUARY </p><p>2000 AND AGAIN IN MAY 2000, NEITHER </p><p>THE FEDERAL NOR STATE GOVERNMENTS DISCOURAGED FREEDOM OF </p><p>ASSEMBLY FOR PEACEFUL RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>SEVERAL NORTHERN STATE GOVERNMENTS BANNED OPEN AIR </p><p>PREACHING AND PUBLIC RELIGIOUS PROCESSIONS IN 2000.  SUCH </p><p>BANS WERE VIEWED AS NECESSARY PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURES AFTER </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PEOPLE DIED IN SHARI\'A-RELATED VIOLENCE </p><p>NATIONWIDE.  THE KOGI STATE GOVERNMENT ENACTED SUCH A BAN ON </p><p>MARCH 1, 2000.  THE KADUNA STATE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED SHORTLY </p><p>THEREAFTER, ENACTING A BAN ON ALL FORMS OF "PROCESSIONS, </p><p>RALLIES, DEMONSTRATIONS, AND MEETINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES." </p><p>GOMBE STATE OFFICIALS, ON MARCH 23, 2000, ARRESTED 19 </p><p>REPORTEDLY PEACEFUL PEOPLE FOR "UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY CAPABLE OF </p><p>CAUSING A BREACH OF PEACE IN THE STATE."  THOSE PEOPLE WERE </p><p>ALLEGEDLY MEETING FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES.  TO DATE, NONE </p><p>OF THESE BANS HAS BEEN FORMALLY LIFTED ALTHOUGH STATE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALLOWED PERMITS ON A CASE-BY-CASE </p><p>BASIS.  IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, LARGE </p><p>OUTDOOR RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS CONTINUED TO BE COMMON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING SHARI\'A-RELATED VIOLENCE IN KADUNA AND ABIA </p><p>STATES, SEVERAL NORTHERN STATE GOVERNMENTS BANNED </p><p>PROSELYTIZING, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS </p><p>PERMITTED BY THE CONSTITUTION.  SOME STATES HAVE </p><p>INFORMALLY RELAXED THESE RESTRICTIONS OVER THE PAST </p><p>YEAR.  OFFICIALS APPEAR TO USE THE "REASONABLE MAN ON </p><p>THE STREET" JUDGEMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE </p><p>PROSELYTIZING BORDERS ON HARASSMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE REPORTS BY CHRISTIANS IN ZAMFARA STATE OF THE </p><p>STATE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS (CHRISTIAN) LITERATURE.  LAST YEAR, BISHOP SAMSON </p><p>BALA, OF GUSAU DIOCESE, SAID THAT THE STATE RADIO STATION HAD </p><p>"CLOSED </p><p>ITS DOORS TO CHRISTIANS."  "COMMERCIALS AND PAID </p><p>ADVERTISEMENTS CONTAINING CHRISTIAN LITERATURE ARE NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED--ONLY ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS ARE AIRED." </p><p>TO DATE, CHRISTIAN GROUPS REPORT NO CHANGE IN THIS </p><p>SITUATION.  SIMILAR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE USE OF </p><p>STATE-OWNED MEDIA FOR MUSLIM PROGRAMMING HAS BEEN REPORTED IN </p><p>THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MILITARY\'S CHAPLAINCY CORPS INCLUDES IMAMS, CATHOLIC </p><p>PRIESTS, AND PROTESTANT PASTORS FOR SOLDIERS OF </p><p>VARIOUS FAITHS.  THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF DISCRIMINATION </p><p>OR NON-ADVANCEMENT TO SENIOR POSITIONS IN THE MILITARY </p><p>DUE TO RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  NO ONE RELIGIOUS FAITH </p><p>DOMINATES THE SENIOR RANKS.  TRADITIONALLY, MORE SOUTHERNERS </p><p>JOINED THE MILITARY THAN NORTHERNERS, AND THEREFORE </p><p>CHRISTIANITY MAY PREDOMINATE IN THE MILITARY AS A WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTIAN STUDENTS IN NORTHERN PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE </p><p>ALLEGED THAT THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO STUDY ISLAMIC </p><p>RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAITH, IN ORDER </p><p>TO GRADUATE.  THEY ALLEGED THAT THE TEACHING OF </p><p>CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN BANNED. </p><p>THE SPEAKER OF THE ZAMFARA HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, WHEN </p><p>CONFRONTED WITH THIS ACCUSATION BY A LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ORGANIZATION, DENIED IT, SAYING THAT TO THE BEST OF HIS </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, THE TWO RELIGIONS WERE BEING TAUGHT SIDE-BY- </p><p>SIDE.  GOVERNORS FROM ZAMFARA AND SOKOTO STATES HAVE </p><p>ALSO DENIED THAT CHRISTIAN STUDENTS CANNOT ACCESS </p><p>BIBLICAL OR CHRISTIAN EDUCATION CLASSES.  THEY HAVE </p><p>INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT SCHOOLS IN RURAL AREAS MAY NOT </p><p>HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THAT </p><p>STUDENTS IN THESE SCHOOLS HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE </p><p>OTHERWISE REQUIRED KORANIC KNOWLEDGE CLASSES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA OFFICES IN ZAMFARA </p><p>AND SOKOTO ALLEGE THAT CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY </p><p>(CO\'S), WHICH ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SHOW TITLE TO </p><p>LAND, ARE BEING DENIED OR DELAYED TO CHRISTIANS.  WHEN </p><p>QUESTIONED ABOUT SPECIFIC </p><p>ALLEGATIONS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF USG OFFICIALS, </p><p>ZAMFARA AND SOKOTO STATE OFFICIALS DENIED THAT </p><p>DISCRIMINATION WAS BEHIND THE FEW CASES CITED BY CAN. </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY POINT OUT THAT THE CERTIFICATION BOARDS </p><p>ARE DEALING WITH A HUGE BACKLOG OF CASES FOR ALL PEOPLE, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF RELIGIOUS FAITH, BECAUSE PREVIOUS MILITARY </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAD SIMPLY STOPPED ISSUING THE CO\'S.  THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ZAMFARA STATE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>RETAKE POSSESSION OF A CLINIC IT ONCE OWNED THAT WAS </p><p>CONFISCATED DURING A </p><p>PERIOD OF MILITARY RULE IN THE 1970S.  THE CHURCH </p><p>HAS BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY TO </p><p>REOCCUPY THE BUILDING AND LAND THAT ADJOINS IT HOUSE OF </p><p>WORSHIP.  HOWEVER, RENEWAL OF THE CO FOR THE CHURCH </p><p>ITSELF WAS APPROVED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE NORTHERN, PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM AREA OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY, ALSO ALLEGED ATTEMPTS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS TO USE ZONING REGULATIONS TO STOP OR SLOW THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW CHRISTIAN CHURCHES.  OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>RESPONDED THAT MANY OF THESE NEW CHURCHES ARE BEING FORMED IN </p><p>TRADITIONALLY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE NOT ZONED </p><p>FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES.  THE HOMEOWNER\'S NEIGHBORS ARE FORCED </p><p>TO ENDURE INCREASED TRAFFIC, PARKING DIFFICULTIES, AND </p><p>ADDITIONAL NOISE AS THE HOME-BASED CHURCH\'S MEMBERSHIP GROWS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE EXPANDED SHARI\'A LAWS TECHNICALLY DID NOT APPLY </p><p>TO CHRISTIANS, THE CHRISTIAN MINORITY, ESPECIALLY IN ZAMFARA </p><p>STATE, WAS UNAVOIDABLY SUBJECTED TO MANY OF THE SOCIAL </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.  IN ZAMFARA, THE SEPARATION OF THE </p><p>SEXES IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES AND THE BAN ON </p><p>ALCOHOL SALE AND CONSUMPTION  HAVE INEVITABLY AFFECTED </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE STATE.  IN ZAMFARA STATE, CHRISTIAN </p><p>ASSOCATIONS HAVE ARRANGED FOR PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES </p><p>FOR CHRISTIAN FEMALES SO THAT THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO WAIT FOR </p><p>FEMALE ONLY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDED BY THE ZAMFARA STATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  SOKOTO STATE\'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS RUN </p><p>COMPLETELY BY PRIVATE OPERATORS.  THE GOVERNOR HAS EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT IF THE PRIVATE OPERATORS CHOOSE NOT TO CARRY FEMALE </p><p>PASSENGERS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS, THE STATE </p><p>CANNOT COMPEL THEM TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SENTIMENTS ABOUT SHARI\'A, </p><p>ALL MUSLIMS IN STATES THAT RETURNED TO CRIMINAL SHARI\'A WERE </p><p>MADE SUBJECT TO THE NEW SHARI\'A CRIMINAL CODES.  AS NOTED </p><p>ABOVE, THE VERY NOTION OF A CRIMINAL LAW WHOSE JURISDICTION </p><p>IS DETERMINED BY THE FAITH OF DEFENDANTS MIGHT BE ARGUED TO </p><p>BE AN INFRINGEMENT ON THEIR FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  IN ZAMFARA </p><p>STATE, MUSLIMS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE ALL CASES HEARD BY </p><p>A SHARI\'A COURT.  OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SHARI\'A LAW </p><p>STILL ALLOW MUSLIMS TO CHOOSE COMMON LAW COURTS FOR CRIMINAL </p><p>CASES IF THEY CHOOSE, BUT SOCIETAL PRESSURE MAY FORCE MOST TO </p><p>USE THE SHARI\'A COURT SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ZAMFARA STATE, RECENT PROPOSED LAWS INCLUDE A DRESS </p><p>CODE FOR WOMEN THAT BANS SHORT SKIRTS AND TROUSERS, THE </p><p>MANDATORY CLOSING OF SHOPS ON FRIDAYS, AND BANNING OF VIDEO </p><p>RENTAL </p><p>CLUBS.  THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA BRANCH IN </p><p>ZAMFARA STATE HAS PROTESTED THESE NEW LAWS TO THE ZAMFARA </p><p>STATE GOVERNMENT.  THEY WERE REPORTEDLY TOLD THE FIRST LAW IS </p><p>FOR PUBLIC DECENCY AND THAT THE SECOND ONLY </p><p>APPLIES TO MULSIM BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN MARCH 2001, A CIVIL RIGHTS CONFERENCE ON SHARI\'A WAS </p><p>CANCELED IN KADUNA DUE TO FEARS OF POTENTIAL VIOLENCE </p><p>FROM VIGILANTE GROUPS. </p><p>IN MARCH 2001, JOURNALISTS COVERING THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF SHARI\'A LAW IN BAUCHI STATE WERE WARNED BY GOVERNOR </p><p>ADHMADU MU\'AZU THAT THEY WOULD BE PROSECUTED IF THEY WROTE </p><p>NEGATIVELY ON HOW SHARI\'A LAWS WERE ENACTED IN THE </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN APRIL 2001, THE KATSINA ARTS AND MUSICIANS </p><p>ASSOCIATION WROTE TO THE KATSINA HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY </p><p>PROTESTING THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF SIRAJO MAI- </p><p>ASHARALLE.  MAI-ASHARALLE WAS ARRESTED BY THE RUNDUNAR </p><p>ADALCI VIGILANTE GROUP WHILE PERFORMING MUSIC AT A LOCAL </p><p>FUNCTION.  THE PERFORMANCE OF MUSIC AND DANCING WAS </p><p>BANNED UNDER THE SHARI\'A LAW INTRODUCED BY KATSINA </p><p>STATE.  THE AMA CITED THIS AS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON </p><p>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ABUSES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SHARI\'A PUNISHMENTS THAT VIOLATE THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS OF MUSLIMS ALSO VIOLATE THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>PER SE.  BECAUSE OF THAT AMBIGUITY, THE FOLLOWING INCIDENTS </p><p>OF SHARI\'A PUNISHMENTS ARE INCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAMFARA STATE AMPUTATED THE HAND OF </p><p>LAWAL ISA BUZU, A CONVICTED BICYCLE THIEF, ON MAY 3, </p><p>2001.  THE VICTIM VOLUNTARILY SUBMITTED TO THE FULL </p><p>SHARI\'A PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AMPUTATION, AND CHOSE NOT </p><p>TO APPEAL THE DECISION.  FOLLOWING THE AMPUTATION, LAWAL </p><p>REPORTEDLY THANKED ALLAH FOR ALLOWING HIM TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>VERDICT AND THANKED GOVERNOR AHMED SANI FOR </p><p>REINTRODUCING SHARI\'A LAW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN JANUARY 2001, ZAMFARA STATE OFFICIALS CANED 14-YEAR-OLD </p><p>BARIYA MAGAZU FOR FORNICATION.  THE UNMARRIED MAGAZU RECEIVED </p><p>100 LASHES AFTER BEARING A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK, WHICH THE </p><p>ALKALI--IN VIOLATION OF SHARI\'A PRECEPTS--CONCLUDED WAS </p><p>CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF FORNICATION.  (COMMENT: THE COURT </p><p>MISREPRESENTED HER AGE AS 17 IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE </p><p>SHARI\'A PRINCIPLE THAT GIRLS UNDER CERTAIN AGES DO NOT HAVE </p><p>THE CAPACITY TO CHOOSE TO HAVE SEX.  END COMMENT).   MAGAZU </p><p>REPORTEDLY WAS FORCED BY HER FATHER TO PROVIDE SEXUAL FAVORS </p><p>TO THREE MEN TO WHOM HE OWED DEBTS.  SHE NAMED THE MEN IN </p><p>COURT, BUT INSTEAD OF PROSECUTING THEM FOR STATUTORY RAP, THE </p><p>COURT FORCED MS. MAGAZU TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED FOUR </p><p>WITNESSES TO THE SEXUAL ACT TO CORROBORATE HER TESTIMONY. </p><p>THIS WAS REPORTEDLY DONE TO PROTECT THE MEN, WHO, BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WERE MARRIED, WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO </p><p>STONING FOR ADULTERY.  BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT "PROVE" THAT THE </p><p>MEN SHE NAMED HAD HAD SEX WITH HER, THE SHARI\'A COURT HANDED </p><p>DOWN A SENTENCE OF 100 LASHES FOR FORNICATION AND  80 </p><p>ADDITIONAL LASHES FOR BEARING FALSE TESTIMONY.  MAGAZU </p><p>APPEALED AND THE SENTENCE WAS </p><p>TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED.  ZAMFARA STATE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>REFUSED TO STAMP THE LEGAL APPEAL AS HAVING BEEN RECEIVED BY </p><p>THE COURT, AND THE JUDGE EXECUTED A REDUCED SENTENCE OF 100 </p><p>LASHES.  MAGAZU\'S APPEAL IS STILL PENDING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OTHER CONVICTED MUSLIM CRIMINALS IN SHARI\'A LAW STATES WERE </p><p>SUBJECTED TO PUBLIC CANING FOR VARIOUS MINOR OFFENSES SUCH AS </p><p>PETTY THEFT, CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL, AND ENGAGING IN </p><p>PROSTITUTION.  THOSE WHO HAD THE SENTENCES CARRIED OUT WERE </p><p>MOST LIKELY POOR AND HAD NO LEGAL REPRESENTATION AT THE TIME </p><p>OF TRIAL.  (NOTE: CANING EXISTS AS A PUNISHMENT AVAILABLE TO </p><p>COMMON LAW JUDGES THROUGHOUT NIGERIA, AND IS BY NO MEANS AN </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY SHARI\'A-BASED PUNISHMENT.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF RELIGIOUS DETAINEES OR </p><p>PRISONERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A NUMBER OF STATE-SANCTIONED AND VIGILANTE SHARI\'A </p><p>ENFORCEMENT GROUPS HAVE FORMED IN SHARI\'A STATES.  IN </p><p>JANUARY, CRIMINAL YOUTHS POSING AS SHARI\'A ENFORCERS BEAT </p><p>LIVINUS OBI, AN IGBO CHRISTIAN, FOR ALLEGEDLY SELLING BEER IN </p><p>KANO.  THEY ALSO INVADED HIS HOME, STOLE MONEY AND LIQUOR AND </p><p>BROKE BOTTLES OF BEER.  ALTHOUGH THE ASSAILANTS WERE BROUGHT </p><p>BEFORE A SHARI\'A COURT ON CHARGES OF ASSAULT AND THEFT, OBI </p><p>LATER DROPPED THE CHARGES BECAUSE HE FELT INTIMIDATED </p><p>TESTIFYING AGAINST HIS NEIGHBORS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>ATTACK.  MILITARY BASES ARE CONSIDERED SHARI\'A-FREE ZONES </p><p>UNDER THE NEW LAWS, BUT ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION, DELIVERY OF </p><p>ALCOHOL TO A BASE WAS FORCIBLY INTERDICTED BY KANO VIGILANTES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>FORCED RELIGIOUS CONVERSION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF THE FORCED RELIGIOUS CONVERSION </p><p>OF MINOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN ABDUCTED OR </p><p>ILLEGALLY REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, OR OF THE </p><p>REFUSAL TO ALLOW SUCH CITIZENS TO BE RETURNED TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN RESPECT FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT OLUSEGUN OBASANJO </p><p>HAS SHOWN A GREATER RESPECT FOR HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS THAN THE MILITARY REGIMES OF THE PAST.  WHILE THE NEW </p><p>SHARI\'A CRIMINAL CODES DO NOT EXPLICITLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST </p><p>CHRISTIANS, THEIR IMPLEMENTATION APPEARS TO HAVE A </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON CHRISTIAN MINORITIES IN THE NORTH. </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT ATIKU ABUBAKAR RECENTLY PLEDGED TO VISIT THE </p><p>TEN STATES WHERE SHARI\'A LAW HAS BEEN ENACTED TO FIND WAYS TO </p><p>PROTECT ADHERENTS OF MINORITY RELIGIONS FROM VIGILANTE GROUPS </p><p>AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CURFEWS, BANS ON LARGE RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS OUTSIDE OF </p><p>TRADITIONAL HOUSES OF WORSHIP, BANS ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>PROCESSIONS, AND BANS ON PROSELYTIZATION REMAIN IN </p><p>EFFECT IN MANY STATES FOLLOWING THE MAYHEM OF THE FEBRUARY </p><p>AND MAY 2000 </p><p>SHARI\'A-RELATED RIOTS.  HOWEVER, LOCAL AND STATE </p><p>AUTHORITIES, WHERE THESE BANS HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT, HAVE </p><p>RELAXED THEM IN PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNOR MAKARFI OF KADUNA STATE HAS PROVIDED </p><p>400 MILLION NAIRA (APPROXIMATELY 3.63 MILLION USD) TO </p><p>PAY RESTITUTION TO VICTIMS OF THE FEBRUARY 2000 RIOTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KADUNA, ABIA, AND LAGOS STATES CONTAIN SOME OF NIGERIA\'S </p><p>LARGEST CITIES, MARKETS, AND HOUSES OF WORSHIP.  THEY </p><p>ALSO SHARE LARGE NUMBERS OF RESIDENTS OF MINORITY </p><p>FAITHS.  SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE LAST YEAR, THESE </p><p>GOVERNORS HAVE TONED DOWN HARSH RHETORIC AND FOCUSED ON </p><p>SHARED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES INSTEAD.  GOVERNOR MAKARFI OF </p><p>KADUNA STATE RECENTLY VISITED MANY SOUTHERN AND MIDDLE-BELT </p><p>STATES TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE TO THEIR INDIGINOUS </p><p>PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING THE KADUNA RIOTS.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING DIVERSITY IN </p><p>NIGERIA\'S MULTI-ETHNIC AND MULTI-RELIGIOUS SOCIETY, AND </p><p>ENCOURAGED THOSE WHO HAD LEFT THE STATE TO RETURN.  THIS TYPE </p><p>OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND INITIATIVE HAS REDUCED THE RHETORICAL HEAT </p><p>THAT SPARKED </p><p>LAST YEAR\'S RIOTS AND PREVENTED FURTHER ROUNDS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS IN THESE STATES\' </p><p>MAJOR CITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER 2000, GOMBE STATE GOVERNOR ABUBAKAR HASHIDU </p><p>SET UP A JUDICIAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>THE CAUSES OF THE RELIGIOUS CLASH THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE </p><p>CITY OF BAMBAM IN 2000.  THE SEVENTEEN-MEMBER COMMITTEE </p><p>INCLUDES BOTH CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, </p><p>REV. GEORGE CAREY, MADE A VISIT TO ZAMFARA </p><p>STATE AND SPOKE WITH GOVERNOR AHMED SANI ON PRACTICAL </p><p>WAYS THAT CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS CAN CO-EXIST.  GOVERNOR </p><p>SANI PROVIDED HIM WITH A HIGH PROFILE WELCOME AND OPEN </p><p>DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF SHARI\'A LAW AND SOME OF ITS </p><p>PUNISHMENTS.  STATE GOVERNORS IN ZAMFARA, SOKOTO, KANO, AND </p><p>KADUNA STATES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO MEET WITH A VARIETY OF USG </p><p>OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS THE 2000 RELIGIOUS RIOTS, THE ENACTMENT </p><p>OF SHARI\'A LAW, AND ATTEMPTS TO ALLAY MINORITY RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUP CONCERNS.  LIKEWISE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>RECEPTIVE TO USG DEMARCHES AND INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS ON </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION III--SOCIETAL ATTITUDES </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIAN LAW PROHIBITS RELIGIOUS OR ETHNIC </p><p>DISCRIMINATION.  NONETHELESS, THERE WERE COMMON REPORTS OF </p><p>INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AGAINST </p><p>PERSONS FROM DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS OR FAITHS, MOST NOTABLY </p><p>IN HIRING OR AWARDING CONTRACTS.  PRIVATE BUSINESSES </p><p>FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN INFORMAL ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>DISCRIMINATION IN THEIR HIRING PRACTICES AND PURCHASING </p><p>PATTERNS.  THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE CULTURE PRACTICE OF THE </p><p>SPOILS SYSTEM: BOTH IN POLITICS AND IN BUSINESS, IT IS </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE REWARDS MEMBERS OF ONES OWN ETHNIC GROUP </p><p>WHERE POSSIBLE.  THIS ETHOS OF GOVERNMENT EXPLAINS THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE NIGERIANS ATTACH TO THE ETHNICITY OR RELIGIOUS </p><p>PERSUASION OF THEIR PRESIDENTS OR MILITARY RULERS. </p><p>RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES IN NIGERIA USUALLY CORRESPOND TO </p><p>REGIONAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES.  BECAUSE OF THE JIHAD OF </p><p>USMAN DAN FODIO, THE NORTHERN REGION AND MUCH OF THE </p><p>MIDDLE-BELT ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MUSLIM, AS ARE THE LARGE HAUSA </p><p>AND FULANI ETHNIC GROUPS OF THAT AREA.  BECAUSE THE BRITISH </p><p>PREVENTED CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES FROM WORKING TO CONVERT </p><p>NORTHERN MUSLIMS, IMMIGRANTS FROM THE SOUTH WERE HISTORICALLY </p><p>THE ONLY CHRISTIANS IN THE NORTH DURING THE COLONIAL ERA. </p><p>CURRENTLY, MANY OF THE SMALLER ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>BELT THAT WERE NOT CONVERTED TO ISLAM HAVE ADOPTED </p><p>CHRISTIANITY OR AN ADMIXTURE OF CHRISTIANITY AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>BELIEFS.  CONVERSELY, BECAUSE THE JIHAD REACHED AS FAR SOUTH </p><p>AS YORUBALAND, A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OR YORUBA ARE MUSLIM. </p><p> MOST SOUTHERN ETHNIC GROUPS, HOWEVER, ARE PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>CHRISTIAN OR ANIMIST.  CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DISTINGUISH RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC CONFLICT OR DISCRIMINATION, </p><p>BECAUSE THE TWO USUALLY OVERLAP.  IT CAN BE SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT ETHNICITY ALMOST ALWAYS TRUMPS RELIGION IN THESE </p><p>CONFLICTS.  THIS WAS EVINCED BY THE KILLING OF SOUTHERN </p><p>MUSLIMS IN THE NORTH DURING THE KADUNA RIOTS, AND HAUSA </p><p>CHRISTIANS DURING REPRISALS IN THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE SHARI\'A CRISIS BEGAN WITH THE SIGNING INTO LAW OF </p><p>TWO BILLS BY THE ZAMFARA STATE GOVERNOR ON OCTOBER 8, </p><p>1999, AIMED AT INSTITUTING ISLAMIC SHARI\'A LAW IN HIS </p><p>STATE.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW BEGAN ON JANUARY 22. </p><p>FOLLOWING ZAMFARA\'S LEAD, SOKOTO, KEBBI, NIGER, KANO, </p><p>KATSINA, KADUNA, JIGAWA, YOBE, AND BAUCHI STATES BEGAN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING VARYING FORMS OF EXPANDED </p><p>SHARI\'A.  BORNO STATE HAS DECLARED THAT SHARI\'A CRIMINAL LAW </p><p>WILL TAKE EFFECT IN JUNE 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHARI\'A CRIMINAL LAW WAS PRACTICED IN THE NORTH UNTIL THE </p><p>ADVENT OF COLONIAL RULE.  WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS, SUCH AS </p><p>OUTLAWING AMPUTATION AND STONING, THE SHARI\'A SYSTEM </p><p>CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE COLONIAL ERA.  THIS MODIFIED SHARI\'A </p><p>WAS SUBSUMED, ALMOST VERBATIM, UNDER THE SECULAR "NORTHERN </p><p>NIGERIAN PENAL CODE" (NNPC) PRIOR TO INDEPENDENCE.  SHARI\'A </p><p>CIVIL COURTS CONTINUED TO OPERATE THORUGHOUT THE NORTH, </p><p>MAINTAINING JURISDICTION OVER PERSONAL AND FAMILY LAW FOR </p><p>MUSLIMS, AND SETTLING CIVIL DISPUTES BETWEEN MUSLIMS.  THE </p><p>RE-INTRODUCTION OF CRIMINAL SHARI\'A ESSENTIALLY ALLOWED </p><p>SHARI\'A COURTS--INSTEAD OF COMMON LAW JUDGES--TO APPLY </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE SHARI\'A CRIMINAL LAW, MOST OF WHICH WAS CONTAINED </p><p>IN THE NNPC.  THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT AMPUTATION </p><p>AND STONING WERE POSSIBLE PUNISHMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME </p><p>SINCE PRE-COLONIAL TIMES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATES ALSO PASSED LAWS OUTLAWING GAMBLING, PROSTITUTION AND </p><p>THE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL BY MUSLIMS.  WHERE THE STATE </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE FAILED TO UPHOLD THESE </p><p>PROVISIONS, NEWLY FORMED VIGILANTE GROUPS HAVE STEPPED </p><p>IN TO ENFORCE THE NEW LAWS, AND IN SOME CASES, PUNISH </p><p>OFFENDERS.  IN ZAMFARA STATE, GOVERNOR AHMED SANI HAS </p><p>VESTED THE LOCAL VIGILANTE GROUP WITH FULL POWERS OF </p><p>ARREST AND PROSECUTION SINCE HE BELIEVES THAT THE POLICE </p><p>ARE NOT ENFORCING THE NEW SHARI\'A LAWS.  LIKEWISE, </p><p>GOVERNOR SAMINU TURAKI OF JIGAWA STATE HAS MOBILIZED A </p><p>STATEWIDE SHARI\'A ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE TO ARREST, </p><p>DETAIN, AND PROSECUTE MUSLIM OFFENDERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN KANO STATE, AN UNOFFICIAL VIGILANTE GROUP, ALSO KNOWN </p><p>AS HISBAH, HAS BEGUN TAKING ACTION AGAINST BOTH MUSLIMS </p><p>AND CHRISTIANS WHO VIOLATE THE NEW SHARI\'A LAWS.  IN </p><p>FEBRUARY, YOUTHS IN THE HISBAH ATTACKED A TRUCK BRINGING </p><p>ALCOHOL TO A MILITARY BASE IN KANO STATE.  THE SAME </p><p>WEEK, THEY ATTACKED THE NIGERIA UNION OF JOURNALISTS </p><p>PRESS CENTER IN KANO BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT ALCOHOL </p><p>WAS SERVED ON THE PREMISES.  ON APRIL 14, 2001, KANO </p><p>STATE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ABDULLAHI UMAR GANDUJE LED </p><p>VIGILANTE ENFORCERS AND NATIONAL POLICE FORCE OFFICERS TO </p><p>FIVE OF KANO\'S LARGEST HOTELS TO ORDER THEM NOT TO SELL </p><p>ALCOHOL.  DURING THE VISITS TO SOME HOTELS, UNOFFICIAL </p><p>VIGILANTE OFFICIALS BROKE LIQUOR BOTTLES AND ENGAGED IN MINOR </p><p>VANDALISM.  ON APRIL 16, THE UNOFFICIAL HISBAH BURNT DOWN THE </p><p>HENZINO HOTEL, AN ESTABLISHMENT KNOWN FOR SERVING ALCOHOL IN </p><p>A PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM NEIGHBORHOOD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN APRIL, SOME KANO STATE HOTELS STOPPED RENTING </p><p>CONFERENCE HALLS TO CHRISTIAN GROUPS FOR FEAR OF BEING </p><p>TARGETS OF THIS VIGILANTE VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES OF OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL </p><p>VIGILANTE GROUPS, THERE WERE VARIOUS REPORTS OF </p><p>MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN CLASHES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2000, FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF A COMMITTEE </p><p>SAMPLING PUBLIC OPINION ON THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARI\'A </p><p>IN GOMBE STATE, A RIOT BROKE OUT IN THE CITY OF BAMBAM. </p><p>SOME SURVIVORS SPECULATED THAT THE ATTACK WAS STARTED BY </p><p>PEOPLE FROM THE NEARBY DADIYA AND TULA COMMUNITIES. </p><p>GOVERNOR ABUBAKAR HASHIDU STATED THAT EIGHTEEN MUSLIMS </p><p>LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE RIOTING.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE LOSS OF LIFE, A NUMBER OF MOSQUES, </p><p>CHURCHES, SHOPS, HOMES, AND VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED IN </p><p>THE RIOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN LATE NOVEMBER 2000, YOUTHS ATTACKED RESIDENTS IN </p><p>HADEJIA LOCAL COUNCIL IN JIGAWA STATE OVER ALLEGEDLY </p><p>BLASPHEMOUS STATEMENTS MADE AGAINST THE PROPHET </p><p>MOHAMMED.  AT LEAST ONE PERSON DIED IN THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>A NUMBER OF CHURCHES AND STORES WERE BURNED DURING THE </p><p>RAMPAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN JANUARY 2001, APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND YOUTHS </p><p>DESTROYED LOCAL HOTELS, SHOPS, AND HOMES IN YOLA </p><p>(ADAMAWA STATE) FOLLOWING ANECLIPSE OF THE MOON THAT </p><p>THEY BLAMED ON PROSTITUES AND THE HOTELIERS THAT </p><p>ALLOWED THEM TO OPERATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 24, 2001, AS MANY AS FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED </p><p>AND AT LEAST TEN WOUNDED WHEN YOUTHS CLAIMING TO BE SHI\'ITES </p><p>CLASHED WITH POLICE DURING A PROTEST FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF </p><p>ISRAELI AMBASSADOR ITZHAK OREN TO GOMBE STATE.  THE YOUTHS </p><p>ALSO BURNED TWO CHURCES AND A NIGHTCLUB DURING THE MELEE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN MAY, VIOLENCE AGAIN ERUPTED IN GOMBE STATE DURING </p><p>LEGISLATIVE DEBATE ON THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARI\'A LAW. </p><p>CHRISTIAN GROUPS OPPOSED TO THE TWO BILLS BEING </p><p>CONSIDERED ORGANIZED PROTESTS WHICH DEVOLVED INTO </p><p>VIOLENT ATTACKS.  ACCORDING TO A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN, </p><p>THERE WERE INJURIES, A NUMBER OF SHOPS WERE LOOTED, AND </p><p>ONE MOSQUE AND ONE CHURCH WERE BURNED DOWN IN A RIOT IN </p><p>THE TOWN OF KUMO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION IV.  U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVES REGULARLY ENGAGE FEDERAL, STATE, AND </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS IN DISCUSSIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES.  WHILE SOME STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS MAY NOT </p><p>ADOPT SUGGESTIONS MADE DURING DEMARCHES OR VISITS BY USG </p><p>OFFICIALS, THEY HAVE BEEN RECEPTIVE AND POLITE IN THESE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE OFTEN BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>SPIRITED DEBATES DEFENDING THEIR POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS WERE HIGHLY RECEPTIVE TO AN </p><p>OFFICIAL FACT-FINDING VISIT BY MEMBERS OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DESPITE ASSURANCES BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT </p><p>CERTAIN SHARI\'A RELATED PUNISHMENTS SUCH AS AMPUTATION </p><p>WOULD BE HELD IN ABEYANCE UNTIL THE COURT SYSTEM COULD HANDLE </p><p>APPEALS REGARDING THE CONSITUTIONALITY OF SHARI\'A-BASED LAWS, </p><p>ZAMFARA STATE OFFICIALS CARRIED OUT A SECOND AMPUTATION.  NO </p><p>OTHER STATES HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT.  EMBASSY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN TO ZAMFARA STATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICIALS FREQUENTLY DISCUSS THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL SITUATION WITH VARIOUS RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO </p><p>PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN CIVIL SOCIETY AND IN THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS COMMUNITY.  EMBASSY OFFICERS ALSO RAISED </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND NGO LEADERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S OVERALL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RESPECT FOR HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.
