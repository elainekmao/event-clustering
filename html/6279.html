<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000413 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA,SA/INS,D </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USAID AMBASSADOR, WENDY CHAMBERLAIN, AA/ANE; GORDON </p><p>WEST, DAA/ANE; JAMES BEVER AND BERNADETTE BUNDY, ANE/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: THIRD PLANNING MEETING FOR TOKYO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   The third planning meeting of the Tokyo Core Group was </p><p>held on March 10.  The Japanese Ambassador said that his </p><p>Government was waiting for confirmations from countries </p><p>asked to co-chair the Tokyo Conference.  Subsequent to the </p><p>co-chair confirmations the Japanese would determine which </p><p>countries and organizations should attend but he anticipated </p><p>that EU members, ASEAN, SARC countries, China, Korea, UAE, </p><p>Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would be invited, subject to the </p><p>approval of the co-chairs. On the issue of seminars, the </p><p>Japanese Ambassador confirmed that his government had been </p><p>overly ambitious in planning for four pre-conference </p><p>meetings.  The Tokyo seminar is cancelled and he asked the </p><p>GSL to see if the EU had an interest in the proposed seminar </p><p>there.  The GOJ would wait until it had a confirmation on </p><p>the co-chair issue before exploring a Brussels seminar </p><p>further. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Since the Washington Seminar dates have been set, </p><p>Ambassador Wills requested further advice from the GSL on </p><p>its goals and possible topics for discussion.  Based on what </p><p>the Post learned earlier, the Ambassador laid out a possible </p><p>scenario for the Washington Seminar for the group to </p><p>consider. The nations invited would be similar to the </p><p>initial list set out by the Japanese Ambassador.  The </p><p>Ambassador suggested three or four presentations of 10-15 </p><p>minutes each covering an update on the Peace Talks by the </p><p>GSL and Norway, a macro-economic assessment by the IMF, and </p><p>a summary of the Needs Assessment by the IFIs.  Minister </p><p>Moragoda said the GSL was thinking about doing a short </p><p>multimedia presentation covering the peace process, </p><p>Regaining Sri Lanka and the GSL priorities. The goal is to </p><p>get donor buy-in prior to Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The Ambassador also raised the issue of attaching </p><p>milestones to assistance disbursement to ensure that donor </p><p>values will be reflected in the way funds are spent. This is </p><p>a key issue for a large number of bilateral donors. The </p><p>World Bank representative concurred but stated that peace </p><p>conditionalities were a very sensitive topic.  Minister </p><p>Moragoda indicated that if this were going to be raised, we </p><p>would need to consider carefully how to structure the </p><p>discussion. </p><p> </p><p>4.   There was considerable discussion about the UN/ADB/WB </p><p>Needs Assessment for the North and East and the location of </p><p>the validation workshop.  This was a sensitive issue because </p><p>the LTTE wants it on its turf although accommodating the </p><p>Tigers is logistically difficult.  Several suggestions on </p><p>multiple workshops or a more centrally located venue in the </p><p>North or East were discussed.  It was agreed that more </p><p>thought needed to be given to the issue.  The GSL vetted its </p><p>ideas on the nature and number of documents that would be </p><p>available for the seminars and the actual Conference and the </p><p>level of detail required by donors prior to pledging. The </p><p>decision was to avoid getting into the weeds but to have the </p><p>backup information available on actual projects and places </p><p>on a database. </p><p> </p><p>5.   The first meeting of the Tokyo Wider Group was held </p><p>immediately following the Core Group meeting.  This wider </p><p>group includes the Ambassadors and High Commissioners from </p><p>countries that participated in the OSLO donor meeting, the </p><p>Director General of the Peace Secretariat, Secretary of the </p><p>Ministry of Enterprise Development, Chairman of the Board of </p><p>Investment, Representative from UNICEF and UNHCR, the </p><p>President of the National Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of </p><p>the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Director of the </p><p>Consortium of Humanitarian Assistance, representing the NGO </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p>6.   A recap of the planning done to date by the Tokyo Core </p><p>Group was provided by Minister Moragoda and the Japanese </p><p>Ambassador.  The IFIs spoke about the PRGF and CAS documents </p><p>which have been sent to their boards for review and </p><p>approval. The PRGF arrangement is for $560 million which is </p><p>a combination of PRGF and EFF funds. The UN Rep reported on </p><p>the Needs Assessment progress and planned validation </p><p>workshop. The remainder of the meeting focused on the pre- </p><p>Tokyo Seminars. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Since the Washington Seminar was the first in line </p><p>Ambassadors were interested in the level of representation </p><p>which was expected. Ambassador Wills indicated that the </p><p>Ministerial and Senior Deputy level from Ministries of </p><p>Finance and Development Cooperation would be invited. </p><p>Because the Seminar was scheduled for the day after the </p><p>close of the World Bank/IMF meetings, the Japanese </p><p>Ambassador requested that the US provide an early </p><p>notification to invitee countries so that they could include </p><p>the Seminar in the travel plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
