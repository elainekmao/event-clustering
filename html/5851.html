Gul has </p><p>asked for written guarantees from Washington in order to </p><p>convince the parliament to support a decision on U.S. troop </p><p>deployments.  Deputy Prime Minister Sener said that the GOT </p><p>has not yet reached agreement with the U.S. regarding the </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops.  White House Spokesman Fleischer </p><p>is quoted by Turkish papers as warning that the offer </p><p>extended by the U.S. is final, and that there is not much </p><p>time left.  Papers speculate that the tough bargaining has </p><p>increased tension between Washington and Ankara.  Reports </p><p>suggest a $6 billion discrepancy between the U.S. offer and </p><p>Turkey\'s demands.  Dailies write that the U.S. </p><p>Administration has rejected Turkey\'s request for $32 </p><p>billion, including $10 billion in grants.  The U.S. has </p><p>promised Turkey a share from Iraqi oil revenues, according </p><p>to "Radikal."  Papers agree that the U.S. will not give </p><p>Turkey more than $26 billion.  "Milliyet" carries the </p><p>details of a `draft agreement\' between the U.S. and Turkey </p><p>on military cooperation.  Turkish and American troops will </p><p>be commanded by national commanders; U.S. troops will be </p><p>subject to Turkish law; the security of U.S. troops </p><p>transiting into northern Iraq will be provided by Turks; </p><p>only U.S. forces will enter Mosul and Kirkuk; the number of </p><p>U.S. troops in Turkey will not exceed 50,000, and Turkey </p><p>will deploy 60,000 troops in northern Iraq.  Papers also </p><p>expect the U.S. to make additional trade concessions to </p><p>Turkey within the framework of proposed QIZ legislation. </p><p>Dailies report that a U.S. vessel unloaded 522 military </p><p>vehicles, including tanks, at the port in Iskenderun. </p><p>Meanwhile, AKP leader Erdogan said on Wednesday that even if </p><p>the U.S. meets Turkey\'s demands, the GOT still prefers to </p><p>see the report by UN arms inspectors before moving ahead. </p><p>Erdogan added that the economic aid package for Turkey </p><p>should be approved by the U.S. Congress.  On the other hand, </p><p>"Hurriyet" claims that the TGS has notified the government </p><p>of the need to restore emergency rule in Southeast Turkey -- </p><p>namely in Diyarbakir, Batman, Siirt, Mardin, Sirnak and </p><p>Hakkari -- in the event of war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The brinksmanship policy" </p><p>Ismet Berkan opined in liberal-intellectual Radikal (2/20): </p><p>"Despite the final offers, at least so they seem, uttered by </p><p>the Turkish and the US sides, the bilateral negotiations are </p><p>still going on.  This is clearly a brinksmanship policy. . </p><p>Interesting part of this story comes with the fact that the </p><p>US is not giving up the northern front option, thus the </p><p>bargaining continues although it is said to be over.  On the </p><p>other hand, this kind of brinksmanship style of policy </p><p>requires a "Plan B" in case the first one does not work. </p><p>The US certainly has an alternative plan and seems </p><p>determined to carry out the operation from the south if </p><p>necessary.  We do not know if this government has a plan B </p><p>in this story." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who is the ingratitude?" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (2/20): </p><p>"When you observe the ongoing negotiation process, one </p><p>clearly can see that this is not a discussion between the so- </p><p>called `strategic partners.\'  The US is imposing its terms </p><p>and conditions upon Turkey, which in no way can be described </p><p>as partnership.  Yet the worse is to come, because at the </p><p>most critical stage of the discussions, the US officials saw </p><p>no harm to themselves in  threatening Turkey openly by </p><p>saying `either our terms are accepted, or Turkey pays for </p><p>serious consequences.\'  . The US is asking Turkey to be on </p><p>its side in a war for which the US has failed to convince </p><p>the world about its reasons.  The strategic partner rhetoric </p><p>is so comfortably uttered yet we don\'t see the </p><p>representatives of the US administration have been acting </p><p>accordingly.  Somebody must remind the fact to the US: </p><p>Turkey is not desperate and helpless." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
