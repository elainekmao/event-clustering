<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/IFD, WHA/CAN AND WHA/EPSC </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/IMI - HARLOW, MATHIEU </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/MAC/ON/OIA/JBENDER </p><p>CALGARY PASS TO WINNIPEG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, CA, Manitoba </p><p>SUBJECT: MANITOBA BUDGET "STEADY AS SHE GOES" AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  On the eve of a provincial election this spring, </p><p>Manitoba\'s left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) government </p><p>delivered a cautious budget on April 22, laying out its fiscal </p><p>plan for the upcoming year.  As in previous NDP budgets, this </p><p>years\' rendition features very modest tax-cuts for middle-income </p><p>earners and devotes more money to health care.  Based on an </p><p>anticipated real growth rate of 3.2 percent, Finance Minister </p><p>Greg Selinger projects the NDP\'s fourth consecutive balanced </p><p>budget since taking power in 1999.  Successive Manitoba </p><p>Governments have brought down balanced budgets each year since </p><p>1995. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The NDP continued the tradition they began in last year\'s </p><p>budget of raiding the revenues of the publicly owned electric </p><p>utility, Manitoba Hydro, for C$52 million to help balance the </p><p>books.  In total, the GOM will collect approximately C$365 </p><p>million in fees, "dividends" and assorted charges from Manitoba </p><p>Hydro in 2003-4.  A C$48 million draw on the province\'s fiscal </p><p>stabilization fund will leave only C$145 million in the fund, </p><p>compared to C$264 million when the NDP took power in 1999.  The </p><p>province expects to spend C$7.256 billion in 2003-4 (an increase </p><p>of 4.7 percent over the previous year), with revenues increasing </p><p>by 5.4 percent.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Manitoba Tax Rates Uncompetitive </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Manitoba\'s meager - and largely symbolic - tax reductions, </p><p>while welcome, have not kept pace with the more rapid reductions </p><p>in most Canadian jurisdictions, feeding fears in the Manitoba </p><p>business community that Manitoba is no longer competitive with </p><p>other Canadian provinces, much less bordering states.  Even after </p><p>the cuts, Manitoba\'s personal and business tax levels remain </p><p>among the highest in Canada.  For example, Manitoba\'s personal </p><p>income tax rates at all levels of income are higher than the </p><p>rates paid by residents of six of Canada\'s ten provinces, </p><p>including Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.  At the same </p><p>time, Manitoba\'s general corporate income tax rate is the second </p><p>highest in the country.  Provincial comparisons aside, when </p><p>Manitobans expressed concerns that their tax rates put them at a </p><p>competitive disadvantage with their U.S. counterparts, the </p><p>Provincial Finance Minister responded that Manitoba retains a </p><p>cost of living advantage over U.S. jurisdictions because higher </p><p>payroll taxes and healthcare costs are not included in the U.S. </p><p>figures.  Manitoba also boasts relatively lower prices for </p><p>electricity than neighboring provinces and states. </p><p> </p><p>A Little Here, a Little There. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  In a budget devoid of major initiatives or incentives, </p><p>funding Manitoba\'s publicly-funded healthcare system clearly </p><p>remains a priority for the NDP.  Funding in 2003-4 will increase </p><p>by 5.7 percent to just over C$3 billion, or 41 percent of the </p><p>province\'s total budget.  Most of the new money for health care </p><p>is coming from the federal government. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Manitoba businesses will be offered a new tax credit to </p><p>invest in equipment or technology that reduces their own energy </p><p>consumption.  The measure, which the GOM predicts will cost C$1 </p><p>million, is meant to leave more hydroelectricity on the grid for </p><p>export, mostly to U.S. customers.  The GOM offered no estimate of </p><p>the amount of energy that will be saved by the measure.  As </p><p>previously announced, the corporate tax will fall by a further </p><p>0.5 percent in 2004 to 15.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Other spending decisions announced in the budget include a </p><p>C$20/per month increase in welfare rates for single recipients </p><p>and people with disabilities, as well as C$1 million to find new </p><p>markets and products to shore up the beleaguered Port of </p><p>Churchill. </p><p> </p><p>Local Reaction:  Underwhelmed </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  Business and taxpayers groups have roundly condemned the GOM </p><p>for failing to provide any meaningful tax relief, and for the </p><p>NDP\'s failure to keep Manitoba competitive with neighboring </p><p>jurisdictions.  The President of the Winnipeg Chamber, Robert </p><p>Kreis, said "It is a very good day for our competitor provinces </p><p>and our competitor businesses outside the province."  Jim Carr, </p><p>president of the Business Council of Manitoba called it </p><p>".typically cautious without much risk taking, and there isn\'t </p><p>much dare-devilling going on.  It tries to straddle the middle, </p><p>where most of the voters are.  We would have liked to have seen </p><p>more aggressive cuts to personal taxation." </p><p> </p><p>8.  The NDP\'s traditional allies on the left were slightly more </p><p>restrained in their criticism of the budget, with Sid Frankel of </p><p>the Social Council of Winnipeg applauding the move to inject $6 </p><p>million into child care, but said the NDP is going to have to tax </p><p>upper-income earners more if it plans to keep funding social </p><p>programs, adding "Government has really put itself in a situation </p><p>where it\'s not taxing those who are really benefiting from the </p><p>economy."  Gaile Whelan Enns, Manitoba director of the Canadian </p><p>Nature Federation\'s Wildland Campaign, praised the NDP\'s new tax </p><p>credit for businesses to reduce energy consumption, but panned </p><p>the government for only funding the creation of one new </p><p>provincial park while 138 areas in Manitoba need protection. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Reaction in Winnipeg\'s major newspapers has also been </p><p>unfavorable. The centrist Winnipeg Free Press said that "if the </p><p>middle class can be bought off with an average tax cut 20 months </p><p>down the road of $155, what does that say about Manitoba?"  It </p><p>further lamented "that there does not seem to be an effective </p><p>opposition with a vision more compelling to voters than the </p><p>promise of a pitiful $155 saving on taxes eventually."  The right </p><p>of center Winnipeg Sun described the budget as having "far too </p><p>many empty carbohydrates and not enough energizing protein." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  This year\'s budget is consistent with the NDP\'s established </p><p>practice in the last four budgets of being cautious to a fault, </p><p>increasing funding to health care, and offering small, targeted </p><p>measures on a multitude of issues, and continuing with the most </p><p>modest tax cuts of any province in Canada.  They have outlined </p><p>the fiscal path they will use in the upcoming election campaign, </p><p>and will be quite content to campaign on a balanced budget, a </p><p>strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in Canada at 5.2 </p><p>percent.  The opposition parties - especially the Progressive </p><p>Conservatives - will likely focus their attacks during the </p><p>campaign on Manitoba\'s uncompetitive tax environment and how it </p><p>is preventing investment and growth as well as hastening the loss </p><p>of the province\'s best and brightest to greener pastures </p><p>elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
