(U) SUMMARY:  On August 28, the Honduran Armed Forces </p><p>(HOAF) designated Army Auditor General Colonel Rodolfo Reyes </p><p>Argueta to investigate the alleged robbery of 230 of 790 </p><p>AKMS-type assault rifles from the arms cache in Naco.  The </p><p>weapons were stored under court injunction in a Honduran </p><p>military facility, and were discovered missing on July 31 </p><p>during a spot check conducted by a prosecutor from the Task </p><p>Force against Organized Crime.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SETTING THE BATTLE SCENE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The small town of Naco hosts the 4th Logistical </p><p>Base (CALE) and a large cache of weapons and artillery.  In </p><p>1985, Longlac Enterprises, a Panamanian-registered arms </p><p>importer, sent weapons to Honduras on deposit for use by the </p><p>HOAF.  After years of poor storage and neglect, the cache </p><p>became a serious hazard, and in 1993 an explosion killed two </p><p>people.  In 2001 the GOH destroyed the unstable weapons, and </p><p>moved the remaining weapons to a more secure storage facility </p><p>- to eliminate the threat to the nearby population and to </p><p>reduce the risk of pilferage. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Meanwhile, Longlac sold the cache of arms to </p><p>Miami-based Samco Global Arms.  For several years, there has </p><p>been a complicated legal battle over the ownership of the </p><p>weapons and who is responsible for removing them.  Currently, </p><p>the Honduran courts control the storage facility and the </p><p>inventories.  The legal battle became even more complicated </p><p>when Samco sued the GOH in Miami and the GOH counterclaimed. </p><p>(COMMENT: Post is concerned that the weapons might fall into </p><p>the hands of arms traffickers or terrorists, and we have </p><p>advised the GOH of the U.S. willingness to assist in the </p><p>destruction or disposal of the remaining cache once ownership </p><p>is established. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MISSING ASSAULT RIFLES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On July 31, 2002, the prosecutor from the Task Force </p><p>against Organized Crime conducted a spot check, accompanied </p><p>by a Court Clerk from the Fourth Circuit of the Honduran </p><p>Criminal Court, a DAO military attache, and a team of arms </p><p>experts from the Defense Intelligence Agency.  The prosecutor </p><p>conducted the spot check using an inventory attested to by </p><p>affidavit of the Chief Judge of the Fourth Criminal Court of </p><p>San Pedro Sula and the Commander of the CALE dated July 31, </p><p>2001.  Moreover, the affidavit certified that the cache was </p><p>being stored under court order and that the keys to the </p><p>storage facility were maintained in the custody of the Court. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Among other arms and ammunition, the inventory </p><p>included 790 AKMS assault rifles that are Chinese-made AKMS </p><p>type 56-1-copies of the Soviet folding stock AKMS.  The </p><p>recent spot check revealed that 230 of the AKMS are missing, </p><p>presumably stolen.  (NOTE:  The Honduran press erroneously </p><p>reports that there are "more than 500 AK-47s" missing.  See </p><p>Reftel for more detailed information about the missing </p><p>weapons.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>HOAF INVESTIGATION? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) On August 28, the high command of the HOAF designated </p><p>Army Auditor General Colonel Rodolfo Reyes Argueta and </p><p>"Captain of Justice" (comparable to the U.S. JAG) Fernando </p><p>Ruiz Figueroa to investigate the alleged theft of the arms. </p><p>Post has no information on either of the individuals that the </p><p>HOAF appointed to investigate the theft. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Post concurs with DAO,s assessment in </p><p>Reftel that the theft was an inside job involving military </p><p>personnel.  While the military guards are the likely </p><p>suspects, it is highly probable the HOAF officers were also </p><p>involved.  Embassy staff will monitor what progress (if any) </p><p>is made in this investigative effort of the HOAF, but is </p><p>pessimistic that the investigation will move forward.  The </p><p>GOH and HOAF do not enjoy a good track record with respect to </p><p>rooting out and addressing corruption.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
