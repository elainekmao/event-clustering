<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002152 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF; ALSO INL </p><p>NSC FOR BYRNE AND FRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LAFIAJI ON NDLEA EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 122773 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2118 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2117 </p><p>     D. LAGOS 2179 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) NDLEA Chairman Alhaji Bello Lafiaji called on </p><p>Ambassador Jeter on August 27.  The Ambassador informed </p><p>Lafiaji that he had shared the non-paper on certification </p><p>benchmarks with National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed and </p><p>President Obasanjo.  The President had informed the </p><p>Ambassador that 250m Naira had been earmarked for the NDLEA, </p><p>and would be released soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador told Lafiaji that the U.S. was aware of </p><p>his efforts, as was President Obasanjo.  Lafiaji complained </p><p>bitterly that he had done a great deal to improve the NDLEA, </p><p>but was still struggling to get resources for the Agency </p><p>(particularly for communications equipment and logistics), </p><p>and to garner support and cooperation from Ministries and </p><p>other government agencies.  He said that he had personally </p><p>filled-out 99 percent of the FATF survey, even though it was </p><p>really the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and it </p><p>still had not been sent.  Lafiaji said that the NDLEA would </p><p>work to meet every benchmark that was part of its portfolio, </p><p>and he would try to get other Ministries and agencies to do </p><p>their part.  Lafiaji bemoaned the lack of cooperation he had </p><p>received, particularly from the Ministry of Justice, and said </p><p>that the Ministry was not playing its required role. </p><p>However, assistance from some state governors for NDLEA zonal </p><p>commands in their states has been excellent, and much better </p><p>than expected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador asked Lafiaji if he planned to </p><p>coordinate with ECOWAS on the NDLEA academy in Jos (Ref D). </p><p>Lafiaji said he would, and observed that he was seeking a </p><p>Ministerial-level endorsement from ECOWAS for the academy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Lafiaji plans to travel to the U.S. for the UNGA to </p><p>address the Third Committee (on October 3 or 4).  He would </p><p>appreciate meetings in Washington the day after his address </p><p>in New York, and would like to meet with INL A/S Rand Beers, </p><p>as well as State/AF, DEA, FBI, and perhaps the NSC.  He told </p><p>the Ambassador that he would inform the Embassy of the exact </p><p>dates of his trip as soon as they are known. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: Lafiaji has made a number of important </p><p>changes in the NDLEA, including a merit-based promotion </p><p>system.  He also opposed politicizing the Agency, including </p><p>appointments of political cronies.  He has also made himself </p><p>readily available to the Embassy, and has stated his </p><p>willingness to address Embassy concerns.  However, there </p><p>seems to be little he can do to make other agencies and </p><p>Ministries more actively engaged, despite his active </p><p>lobbying.  He expressed strong frustration with others in the </p><p>GON, and reacted somewhat defensively when the Ambassador </p><p>said that not enough was being done.  Embassy will watch for </p><p>improved GON performance as a result of President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>infusion of much needed money into the NDLEA and recent </p><p>high-level approaches on the counter-narcotics benchmarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: On August 29, Lafiaji called the </p><p>Ambassador to inform him that 60 kg of cocaine had been </p><p>seized from a ship from Brazil at Tin Can Island (Lagos). </p><p>Lafiaji described this as the single largest interdiction </p><p>since the beginning of his tenure.  Embassy will report on </p><p>this potentially significant development as more information </p><p>becomes available.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
