HARARE 1276, B. HARARE 1102 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\' AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON APRIL 10 EDGAR GUNDRY, CHAIRMAN FOR THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) REGION OF MASHONALAND </p><p>WEST-SOUTH, TOLD ECONOFF THAT A GROUP OF CFU OFFICIALS </p><p>MET ON APRIL 9 WITH ZIMBABWE\'S FIVE SECURITY SERVICES. </p><p>THESE SERVICES, ACCORDING TO GUNDRY, ARE THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>OFFICE, THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE, THE ZIMBABWE NATIONAL ARMY, </p><p>AND THE ZIMBABWE AIR FORCE.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING </p><p>WAS FOR THE CFU TEAM TO PRESENT THEIR "FARMING INTO THE </p><p>FUTURE" PLAN, A BLUEPRINT AGREED TO AT THE CFU SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS HELD IN MARCH (REF B).  GUNDRY DID NOT KNOW THE </p><p>NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS WHO HAD REPRESENTED EACH OF THE </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES, BUT SAID THAT THE PRESENTATION WAS </p><p>VIDEOTAPED BY SECURITY OFFICIALS.  HE BELIEVED THIS WAS </p><p>DONE SO THAT THE PRESENTATION COULD BE VIEWED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GUNDRY WAS INFORMED BY THE CFU EXECUTIVE THAT THE </p><p>PRESENTATION WAS RECEIVED POSITIVELY BY THE FIVE </p><p>SECURITY SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES.  HOWEVER, THE CFU TEAM </p><p>WAS ALSO TOLD BY ONE, APPARENTLY IN REFERENCE TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE, THAT "YOU </p><p>CREATED A MONSTER, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT. </p><p>WE WILL FORGIVE YOU AND MOVE ON, BUT WE WILL NOT FORGET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01293  111239Z </p><p>THAT." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) GUNDRY SAID THAT THE MEETING WITH THE SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES WAS PART OF THE CFU\'S ONGOING EFFORT TO QUIETLY </p><p>RE-ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE (REF A).  AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, GUNDRY </p><p>REVEALED THAT THE CFU TEAM WAS SCHEDULED TO MEET ON </p><p>APRIL 10 WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON LAND TO </p><p>PRESENT THE CFU PLAN.  GUNDRY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE CFU </p><p>EXECUTIVE THAT THE GOZ OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED </p><p>THE PLAN HAVE REACTED FAVORABLY TO IT, BUT THAT NONE OF </p><p>THESE OFFICIALS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THE PLAN AS </p><p>A WAY FORWARD ON THE LAND ISSUE.  IT IS CLEAR, GUNDRY </p><p>ADDED, THAT THE FINAL DECISION LIES WITH ONE PERSON -- </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THE CONTINUING QUIET MEETINGS BETWEEN </p><p>THE CFU AND THE GOZ ARE POSITIVE INDICATORS.  IT IS </p><p>CLEAR TO ALL THAT THE GOZ\'S "FAST TRACK" LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM IS GETTING NOWHERE FAST.  OUR BEST </p><p>GUESS, THROUGH TALKING TO COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND </p><p>BUSINESSES, AND TRACKING PRESS REPORTS, IS THAT NO MORE </p><p>THAN 5,000 FAMILIES HAVE BEEN RESETTLED NATIONWIDE UNDER </p><p>"FAST TRACK".  (NOTE: THE WORLD BANK ESTIMATES A TOTAL </p><p>OF 27,000 PEOPLE IN THESE 5,000 FAMILIES.  THIS </p><p>CONTRASTS WITH THE LATEST GOZ CLAIM OF 80,000 FAMILIES </p><p>RESETTLED.)  THE RESETTLEMENT THAT HAS OCCURRED HAS </p><p>ENTAILED GIVING PEOPLE A PIECE OF LAND ON AN OCCUPIED </p><p>FARM, AND PROVIDING NO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE OR SUPPORT </p><p>SERVICES.  GIVEN THAT THE GOZ HAS NO RESOURCES TO FUND A </p><p>REAL RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, THE CURRENT FREEFALL IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01293  111239Z </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY, AND THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS PLAY IN THE ECONOMY, THE PRESSURE IS </p><p>MOUNTING ON PRESIDENT MUGABE TO REACH A COMPROMISE ON </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE.  HOWEVER, POLITICAL GAIN FROM THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE REMAINS THE OVERRIDING CONCERN FOR MUGABE.  HE </p><p>WILL NOT AGREE TO A COMPROMISE WITH THE CFU AND WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNLESS IT ALLOWS HIM A WAY TO </p><p>PROCLAIM VICTORY ON THE LAND ISSUE AND USE THIS TO </p><p>BOLSTER THE RULING PARTY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.  OUR </p><p>VIEW IS THAT THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE MUGABE WILL </p><p>TAKE THIS OPTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
