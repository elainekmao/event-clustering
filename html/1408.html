(C) SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH COMMISSIONER A.J.D. NDOU TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD AT LUNCH ON DECEMBER 2 THAT, WHILE HE </p><p>HAD WORKED ON THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE MEETING AMONG </p><p>PRESIDENTS MBEKI, OBASANJO AND MUGABE, HE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>BRIEFED ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR NOVEMBER 30 MEETING. </p><p>ACCORDING TO GODFREY MWEDZI, ZIMBABWEAN MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA, THE THREE HEADS OF </p><p>STATE MET ALONE FOR FOUR HOURS, EXCLUDING MINISTERS, </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONERS AND NOTE TAKERS FROM THEIR </p><p>DELIBERATIONS.  THEY EMERGED AFTER THEIR MEETING TO FACE </p><p>THE PRESS, AT WHICH TIME NEITHER MBEKI NOR MUGABE LOOKED </p><p>COMFORTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PRESIDENT MBEKI HOPED TO HAVE A CANDID </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH MUGABE ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC QUAGMIRE, BECAUSE HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT </p><p>IS HAPPENING HERE, ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN HEAD OF STATE REASONS </p><p>THAT IF THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT ONLY FOLLOWED ITS OWN </p><p>LAW WITH RESPECT TO LAND REFORM THE PROBLEMS IT IS </p><p>ENCOUNTERING COULD BE RESOLVED.  THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT SHOULD BE USING THE POLICE IN A NON-PARTISAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06803  050607Z </p><p>MANNER AND RESPECTING COURT ORDERS.  AS IT WAS, THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE IS BECOMING A BIGGER REGIONAL PROBLEM, AFFECTING </p><p>NOT ONLY SOUTH AFRICA BUT OTHERS.  MBEKI WAS MEASURED IN </p><p>WHAT HE SAID, HOWEVER, SINCE HE DID NOT WANT THE DOOR TO </p><p>CONTINUING ENGAGEMENT SHUT ON HIM, NDOU TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR. RATHER, THE SOUTH AFRICAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE </p><p>LOOKED TO HIS NIGERIAN COUNTERPART TO COME ON STRONGER. </p><p>ON AT LEAST THREE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS MBEKI HAD DELIVERED </p><p>A SIMILAR MESSAGE, BUT HAD CONCLUDED THAT HE COULD NOT </p><p>FORCE MUGABE TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO DO, </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICAN DIPLOMAT AVERRED.  NDOU ALSO TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE TWO KEY SOUTH AFRICAN PARASTATALS, ESKOM AND </p><p>SASOL, WILL CONTINUE SUPPLYING ZIMBABWE LIMITED AMOUNTS </p><p>OF ELECTRICITY AND FUEL ON AN OPEN ACCOUNT BASIS, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THESE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PAST HAVE ADVOCATED </p><p>BUSINESSLIKE DECISIONS BEING TAKEN REGARDING ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURING THE LUNCHEON THAT MUGABE HOSTED FOR HIS </p><p>GUESTS (THAT NDOU ATTENDED), HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN </p><p>NKOMO ARRIVED LATE AND IN GOOD SPIRITS DIRECTLY FROM HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN. </p><p>NDOU SAID THAT AFTER NKOMO REPORTED HOW PRODUCTIVE HIS </p><p>CONVERSATION HAD BEEN, MUGABE RESPONDED WITH A JOKE </p><p>ABOUT MALLOCH-BROWN BEING BRITISH.  (COMMENT: ON </p><p>DECEMBER 2 AT A NATIONAL TREE PLANTING DAY CEREMONY, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE DEPARTED FROM HIS PREPARED REMARKS AND </p><p>REVERTED TO HIS INCREASINGLY TRADEMARK, VITUPERATIVE </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST THE WHITE FARMERS, THE COURTS, THE </p><p>BRITISH AND ANY AND ALL STANDING IN THE WAY OF THE FAST- </p><p>TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.
