SUMMARY: The Public Affairs Section and the </p><p>Foreign Commercial Service of the U.S. Mission in </p><p>Nigeria organized two one-day seminars, June 19-20, </p><p>in Abuja focusing on the Africa Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA).  The seminars, "AGOA: </p><p>Participating in Trade," and "Public-Private </p><p>Partnership for Success with AGOA," featured PD- </p><p>provided speaker Dr. Sharon Freeman with Fred </p><p>Oladeinde and Gregory Simpkins of the Washington- </p><p>based Foundation for Democracy in Africa and Embassy </p><p>Counselor for Commercial Affairs Miguel Pardo de </p><p>Zela.  The interaction of the speakers with the </p><p>audience, and the audience with itself, created a </p><p>positive dynamic and led to pledges of follow-up </p><p>between the GON and private sector.  Audience </p><p>participation included seven Senators from the </p><p>Committee on Economic Affairs; senior officials of </p><p>the Nigeria Customs Service, Nigerian Investment </p><p>Promotion Council (NIPC), and Nigerian Export </p><p>Promotion Council (NEPC); officials from Ministries </p><p>of Commerce and Industries at state and federal </p><p>levels, and leading industrialists and textile </p><p>industry representatives from Kano and Kaduna.  The </p><p>seminars also promoted AGOA-related activities </p><p>including the July 11-12 Seminar in Accra, Ghana. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GPRA Data: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: More than 140 </p><p>policymakers and key players in the Nigerian </p><p>manufacturing sector participated in the two days of </p><p>seminars.  The key speaker for the two sessions, Dr. </p><p>Sharon Freeman, described AGOA and explained its </p><p>potential to enhance growth and productivity.  Dr. </p><p>Freeman said the failure to date to implement </p><p>textile visas and trans-shipment laws, and poor </p><p>infrastructure, had prevented Nigeria from realizing </p><p>significant benefits from AGOA.  She encouraged the </p><p>private and public sector participants to express </p><p>their own concerns, and suggested possible remedies </p><p>based on her experience promoting the Caribbean </p><p>Basin Initiative in the 1980s. Oladeinde and </p><p>Simpkins addressed the need for public-private </p><p>sector interaction.  Pardo de Zela discussed the </p><p>inevitability of globalization, the need for </p><p>Nigerian enterprises to proactively seek out and use </p><p>available information and sources of credit, and </p><p>described how the Foreign Commercial Service could </p><p>assist businesses wishing to export to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: During the two </p><p>years since AGOA became law, Nigeria has made little </p><p>progress in increasing exports to the U.S. </p><p>Macroeconomic policies which hamper exports, a lack </p><p>of commitment by the business community, and poor </p><p>infrastructure are among the obstacles to using AGOA </p><p>to create an alternative to petroleum as a source of </p><p>export earnings.  These seminars brought key </p><p>individuals and institutions together to see how </p><p>these problems might be addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  DATE: June 19-20, 2002, FY 2002, third quarter </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. MPP UMBRELLA THEME AND AUDIENCE REACHED: Economic </p><p>Development.  Over 140 contacts drawn from relevant </p><p>Nigerian institutions, including officials of the </p><p>Ministry of Commerce, Nigerian Export Promotion </p><p>Council, Nigerian Investment Promotion Council, </p><p>NEXIM Bank, Nigerian Customs Service, elected </p><p>officials including several national legislators and </p><p>state governors or their representatives, and </p><p>private sector representatives from chambers of </p><p>commerce, major textile manufacturers, exporters, </p><p>and non-governmental organizations engaged in </p><p>manufacturing attended the seminar.  Regular viewers </p><p>of Nigeria\'s national television, estimated to be </p><p>several million, and those who read newspapers, were </p><p>also part of the audience reached with the AGOA </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. NON-USG SUPPORT: None </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. USG SUPPORT: Excellent.  Post appreciates </p><p>Washington\'s support in making Dr. Freeman </p><p>available.  The Foreign Commercial Service was also </p><p>of great assistance, as was USAID, which sponsored </p><p>Oladeinde and Simpkins and his group in their trip </p><p>to Nigeria.  Freeman is an articulate speaker.  At </p><p>Post request, she modified her presentation to </p><p>promote greater dialogue among the participants. Her </p><p>experience in working with Central America gave her </p><p>the authority to convince the audience that they </p><p>could overcome similar problems facing their export </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. MEDIA REACTION: Dr. Freeman gave a 45-minute </p><p>interview to Rhythm Radio, Abuja.  The national TV </p><p>network, NTA, gave her a 60-second soundbite. </p><p>Lagos-based Vanguard, one of Nigeria\'s leading </p><p>papers, particularly among business readers, ran a </p><p>three-quarter-page interview with Dr. Freeman. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
