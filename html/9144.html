<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS AF/W, INR, EB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EPET, ENRG, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON AND LABOR REMAIN AT LOGGERHEADS AS </p><p>FUEL STRIKE CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1147 (B) ABUJA 1135 (C) ABUJA 1107 (D) </p><p>     ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter: Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary: Nigeria has entered the third day of a </p><p>national strike, with no agreement in sight between the </p><p>National Labour Congress (NLC) and the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration over fuel prices.  Tensions in Abuja rose </p><p>today as police clashed with NLC leaders and demonstrators. </p><p>Street clashes continued in Lagos and other parts of the </p><p>south and a major demonstration is planned in Kano later </p><p>today.  Crude oil production appears unaffected thus far, but </p><p>the senior staff union PENGASSAN has now stated it will join </p><p>the strike if no agreement is reached by midnight Sunday, </p><p>July 6.  Air traffic experienced increased delays and </p><p>disruptions, as strike supporters found ways to sporadically </p><p>block operations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Obasanjo Intransigent </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) A senior official at the Presidency told Poloff that </p><p>Obasanjo was, for now, "intransigent" on rolling back the </p><p>fuel price increase. "These meetings are a waste of time </p><p>because we have been instructed not to compromise," he </p><p>claimed.  During a speech at the Presidency on Monday, </p><p>Obasanjo professed that with the fuel subsidy gone, the GON </p><p>would better fund hospitals, roads and schools; the same </p><p>justification he used for the last increase.  He also said </p><p>that the price hike was good because it would curb Nigerians\' </p><p>appetite for road travel. Obasanjo\'s logic was that since </p><p>fuel was now more expensive, the average Nigerian would </p><p>travel less, stay at home more, and be more industrious.  He </p><p>also quipped that less travel on Nigerian roads would save </p><p>the GON millions of naira on road repair bills. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNPC Not Optimistic </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Austen Oniwon, a senior aide to Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Group Managing Director </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki, confirmed to Econoff that the GON and NLC </p><p>remained at loggerheads.   Stating that during yesterday\'s </p><p>meeting, the NLC indicated willingness to accept a small fuel </p><p>price increase.  The two sides could not agree on the exact </p><p>amount. Oniwon was not optimistic that the NLC and GON would </p><p>reach an agreement during meetings scheduled for today. </p><p>Although the Permanent Secretary and Acting Minister of Labor </p><p>told the Ambassador this afternoon that progress was being </p><p>made and he thought a settlement was imminent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) NLC officials privately indicated to Emboff that they </p><p>would be willing to accept a 5 to 7 naira increase in fuel </p><p>prices but maintain their public posture that no increase is </p><p>acceptable.  Press reports on Monday indicated that the GON </p><p>might consider a reduction.  Nonetheless, in public </p><p>appearances over the last two days, Obasanjo has stubbornly </p><p>advocated keeping the full price hike in place. (Comment: </p><p>Obasanjo, by engaging the NLC in marathon meetings, may be </p><p>stalling for time in hopes that the strike will fizzle.  End </p><p>Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NLC Prepared For The Long-Haul? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) NLC senior official Benson Upah confirmed last night\'s </p><p>negotiations made no headway.  Upah said he was very </p><p>pessimistic that an agreement could be reached soon, stating </p><p>"we are in for the long haul, and we are prepared".  All NLC </p><p>officials were concerned by the GON\'s continued excessive use </p><p>of force to quell labor\'s peaceful demonstrations at Abuja\'s </p><p>Federal Secretariat and other locations, he stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>White Collar Oil Union May Join NLC </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Kenneth Narebor, General Secretary of the white-collar </p><p>petroleum workers\' union PENGASSAN, confirmed that he issued </p><p>a warning yesterday that PENGASSAN members will join the </p><p>nation-wide strike next week if no agreement were reached by </p><p>midnight, July 6.  Narebor said a directive will be sent out </p><p>later today to all PENGASSAN\'s units instructing them to shut </p><p>down oil production facilities if ongoing negotiations </p><p>between the NLC and the federal government remain deadlocked </p><p>by Saturday, July 5.  He also said his union is "dead </p><p>serious" about this warning, and will ensure that the oil and </p><p>gas sector is completely shut down by the weekend if a </p><p>breakthrough were not achieved.  He stated he was, however, </p><p>optimistic that on-going talks between NLC and GON would </p><p>produce positive results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Meanwhile, NUPENG Organizing Secretary Bernard Ugbi </p><p>reported that his union had not previously considered a </p><p>shut-down option, but added that it cannot be ruled out in </p><p>view of PENGASSAN\'s new statements.  Until now, the two </p><p>unions have agreed to keep oil flowing during the strike so </p><p>as not to completely undermine Nigeria\'s economy while NLC </p><p>pressures the federal government for action on the fuel price </p><p>issue.  On July 2, a Conoco representative echoed earlier </p><p>reports from Shell and ExxonMobil that while its headquarters </p><p>are operating with skeleton staff, crude production has not </p><p>been affected in the first two days of the strike. </p><p>Police Assaults Journalists, Imprison Labor Leaders </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Demonstrations continue throughout Abuja on Wednesday. </p><p> Police reportedly fired shots and used tear gas to disperse </p><p>demonstrators at the Federal Secretariat, the Federal Capital </p><p>Development Authority, Ministry of Works and Housing and </p><p>Abuja\'s main market.  We have no information on possible </p><p>injuries during these incidents.  During a NLC-led </p><p>demonstration at the Federal Secretariat yesterday, police </p><p>assaulted four journalists, hospitalizing one, for taking </p><p>photos.  Police incarcerated over twenty labor leaders in </p><p>Abuja yesterday and reportedly imprisoned scores of NLC local </p><p>leaders nation-wide. Maj. Gen. G. A. Kpamber was accused of </p><p>ordering security at the Secretariat to use live ammunition </p><p>to prevent a speech by NLC President Adams Oshiomhole on </p><p>Monday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Confirming previously reported deaths, a security </p><p>official told Emboff that the strike is "gaining momentum." </p><p>A senior military officer echoed this sentiment, telling </p><p>Poloff that Defense HQ is "increasingly concerned" about the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  More vehicles have taken to the streets in Abuja, </p><p>but virtually all of the North remains shut down.  Gas </p><p>stations throughout the North have received no deliveries for </p><p>more than 10 days, but fuel has been generally unavailable at </p><p>stations for more than a year.  In Abuja, the stations opened </p><p>for business Wednesday, but were evidently ordered closed </p><p>after the morning demonstrations, stranding hundreds of </p><p>vehicles queued up for fuel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  Port Harcourt remained very calm on Wednesday </p><p>morning.  Some private cars are plying the streets, but gas </p><p>stations have run out of fuel and are shuttered.  In spite of </p><p>reports in the government-influenced press that the strike </p><p>has had no effect in Rivers State, only 20 percent of the </p><p>civil service, almost all senior staff, reported for work at </p><p>the Federal Secretariat today.  NLC representatives entered </p><p>the buildings on Tuesday and effectively chased workers out. </p><p>Workers arriving Wednesday morning found an increased police </p><p>presence at the Secretariat compound.  The federal government </p><p>is both tightening security and offering incentives to civil </p><p>service workers willing to come to work.  One government </p><p>circular requires staff to display their certificates of </p><p>employment to their superiors on a daily basis.  Another </p><p>lists incentives such as increased housing allowances, </p><p>transportation and meals upwards of 300 percent more than </p><p>present rates as a ploy to entice workers back to their </p><p>desks.  However, similar proposals were forwarded several </p><p>months ago before the dispute over wages, so most civil </p><p>servants view these incentives as empty promises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FLIGHTS ON OR OFF? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Domestic airlines and the government-influenced </p><p>press report that normal flight operations have resumed </p><p>throughout the country.  Spot checks indicate, however, that </p><p>many flights have been canceled for lack of passengers.  Many </p><p>of the few remaining flights have been delayed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  The strike appears to be holding its own into its </p><p>third day.  While it is difficult to assess the compliance </p><p>with the NLC\'s "stay-at-home" directive, it is apparent that </p><p>the level of confrontation on the street has risen since </p><p>Monday.  While the GON-influenced press generally downplays </p><p>the strike, wire service reports that the country is in </p><p>flames are equally exaggerated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The truth remains somewhere in between. It is </p><p>unlikely that the NLC will be willing to show much </p><p>flexibility without significant concessions on the part of </p><p>government.  Meanwhile, the Obasanjo Administration is losing </p><p>even greater political support the longer the strike drags </p><p>on.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
