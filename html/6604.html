<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000746 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, GT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MARCH 17 LETTER FROM PRESIDENT PORTILLO TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) President Alfonso Portillo sent President Bush a </p><p>letter on March 17 (delivered by the Guatemalan Embassy in </p><p>Washington to the White House and Department of State) saying </p><p>that Guatemala stands by the United States during the current </p><p>difficult international situation.  Following is the </p><p>Embassy\'s translation of the text of the Portillo letter: </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Begin text: </p><p>Guatemala, March 17, 2003 </p><p>Mr. George W. Bush </p><p>President of the United States of America </p><p> </p><p>Mr. President: </p><p> </p><p>I have the honor to address you to express my solidarity </p><p>(with you) during this difficult moment in the international </p><p>situation.  My government shares your concern over the </p><p>persistence of international actors that represent a serious </p><p>risk to international peace and security, as well as the need </p><p>for the community of nations to act with determination to </p><p>confront these risks. </p><p> </p><p>Of those risks, the most virulent is terrorism, while so </p><p>violently has attacked your country as well as many others in </p><p>the world.  All of the nations and peoples of the world have </p><p>an obligation to act in concert to prevent, attack and, if </p><p>possible, eradicate this threat. </p><p> </p><p>At the same time, we remember the need to maintain the great </p><p>achievements that humanity has gradually built over the past </p><p>century, in particular, the multilateral organizations such </p><p>as the United Nations, which are the best guarantee that we </p><p>will continue to build a world founded on the values of </p><p>democracy and peace. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. President, permit me to repeat my desire that our nations </p><p>conserve their friendship and shared visions for better </p><p>societies. </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary closing) </p><p>Alfonso Portillo (signed) </p><p>end text. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment:  Like his public statements, in which </p><p>Portillo has not wanted to comment on his position on </p><p>hostilities with Iraq but has wanted to appear on the side of </p><p>the U.S., the letter to President Bush is another attempt by </p><p>Portillo to have it both ways. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
