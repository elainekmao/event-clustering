EDDY-COUNTRYMAN E-MAIL 01/11/03 </p><p>B. FINKBEINER-TEKACHBALL E-MAIL 08/01/02 </p><p>C. 02 STATE 266327 </p><p>D. 02 ROME 2977 </p><p>E. 02 ROME 2257 </p><p>F. 02 ROME 6098 </p><p>G. 02 ROME 6135 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) IN RESPONSE TO REF A, ECONOFF MET JANUARY 14 WITH MFA </p><p>NP COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR TO ONCE AGAIN EXPRESS STRONG U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS OVER THE SALE OF HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS FROM </p><p>ITALIAN FIRMS TO IRAN, AND TO INQUIRE WHETHER ANY SUCH </p><p>VESSELS HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO IRAN. (REFS D-G CHRONICLE OUR </p><p>PREVIOUS EXCHANGES WITH THE GOI ON THIS AND OTHER </p><p>IRAN-RELATED NP ISSUES.)  DE MOHR RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THE BOATS HAD BEEN DELIVERED FROM THE </p><p>COMPANIES TO IRAN.  REITERATING WHAT HE TOLD US DURING OUR </p><p>INQUIRY IN LATE JULY (REF B), DE MOHR SAID THAT, SINCE THE </p><p>GOI HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE BOATS WERE NEITHER MILITARY NOR </p><p>DUAL-USE IN NATURE, THEY WERE NOT SUBJECT TO GOI CONTROLS </p><p>(SUCH AS AN EXPORT LICENSE).  AS SUCH, THE GOI HAD NOT </p><p>FOLLOWED UP TO SEE WHETHER THE BOATS WERE EVER DELIVERED.  DE </p><p>MOHR AGREED, HOWEVER, TO CHECK INTO THE MATTER FOR US.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT, AFTER OUR JULY CONVERSATION, HE HAD </p><p>CONSULTED ONCE AGAIN WITH OTHER GOI AGENCIES, ALL OF WHICH </p><p>CONFIRMED THEIR VIEWS THAT THE BOATS WERE SOLELY CIVILIAN IN </p><p>NATURE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) ECONOFF ALSO STRESSED THAT USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>DELIVERY OF THESE VESSELS TO IRAN WERE SO STRONG THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE MIGHT BE RAISED DURING FOREIGN MINISTER FRATTINI,S </p><p>UPCOMING MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY.  DE MOHR RESPONDED THAT </p><p>IN ANY BRIEFING OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER HE WOULD REITERATE </p><p>THE GOI INTERAGENCY CONSENSUS THAT THE BOATS WERE NEITHER </p><p>MILITARY NOR DUAL USE, WHILE POINTING OUT THE OPPOSING US </p><p>VIEW.  HE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE WAS NO LEGAL AUTHORITY </p><p>FOR THE GOI TO STOP DELIVERY OF THE BOATS, GIVEN THE GOI,S </p><p>EVALUATION OF THEIR USE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ECONOFF ALSO RAISED THE POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>ITALIAN COMPANIES IN THE COMPETITION FOR CONTRACTS TO </p><p>RETROFIT LIBYAN BOATS TO MAKE THEM SUITABLE FOR TRAINING </p><p>DIVERS (REF C).  DE MOHR TOLD US THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY </p><p>SUCH INTEREST ON THE PART OF ITALIAN FIRMS. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
