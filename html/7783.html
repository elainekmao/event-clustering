SUMMARY:  ROME GENEVA GROUP (GG) MEMBERS ARE DIVIDED ON </p><p>SUPPORTING ZERO NOMINAL GROWTH OR ZERO REAL GROWTH FOR THE </p><p>UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION\'S (FAO) UPCOMING 2004- </p><p>2005 BUDGET BUT DO AGREE THAT GOVERNANCE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM: </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION HAS REPEATEDLY FAILED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO </p><p>MEMBER PRIORITIES.  GG COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>WORKING FOR GREATER FAO ACCOUNTABILITY: THE RECENTLY ISSUED </p><p>JIU REPORT ON FAO MANAGEMENT PROVIDED A GOOD ROAD-MAP FOR </p><p>NEEDED REFORM, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS FAO COUNTRY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES.  GG MEMBERS WILL SEEK PROGRAM AND FINANCE </p><p>COMMITTEE ENDORSEMENT OF A TIME-BOUND FAO ACTION PLAN FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ROME GENEVA GROUP (MAJOR DONORS) MET APRIL 30, 2003 </p><p>AT THE U.S. MISSION TO DISCUSS THE UPCOMING FAO FINANCE AND </p><p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEETINGS.  DELEGATES FROM THE U.K., THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS, BELGIUM, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, </p><p>JAPAN AND FRANCE ATTENDED.  ITALY, CANADA, SPAIN AND SWEDEN </p><p>SPAIN WERE ABSENT. </p><p> </p><p>FINANCE COMMITTEE </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3. UNDER "FINANCIAL AND BUDGET REPORTS," THE U.S. CALLED </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT CERTAIN FAO DIVISIONS (MOST </p><p>NOTABLY THE INVESTMENT CENTER) HAD OVERSPENT IN THE FIRST </p><p>YEAR OF THE BIENNIUM.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE FAO WAS IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF SELECTING A NEW INVESTMENT ADVISOR LONG-TERM </p><p>PORTFOLIO MANAGER (THE FORMER ADVISOR MANAGER HAVING FAILED </p><p>TO MEET THE AGREED BENCHMARKS.)  THE NETHERLANDS NOTED THAT </p><p>BOTH IFAD AND WFP HAVE A NEW INVESTMENT ADVISOR "WITH WHICH </p><p>THEY APPEAR TO BE SATISFIED."  MEMBERS HAD A BRIEF </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IFAD\'S INVESTMENTS </p><p>(WHICH ARE LONG-TERM) AND FAO\'S (WHICH ARE MORE SHORT TERM). </p><p>IT WAS NOTED THAT BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA HAD THE LARGEST </p><p>ARREARS TO THE ORGANIZATION.  DO YOU WANT TO MENTION </p><p>ARREARS? </p><p> </p><p>4. UNDER "OVERSIGHT MATTERS" MEMBERS DISCUSSED FOLLOW-UP TO </p><p>THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR, NOTING THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF MANY OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR\'S FINDINGS, AND </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAO COMPLIANCE.  THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC </p><p>DISCUSSION OF ANY RECOMMENDATION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF A NEW INTERNAL AUDITOR.  IN THIS CONTEXT, IT </p><p>WAS NOTED THAT FAO HAS NOT YET ADVISED CONCERNING THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT A NEW INTERNAL AUDITOR (AGENDA ITEM 10). </p><p></p><p>5. UNDER "FINANCIAL POLICY MATTERS," MEMBERS DISCUSSED THE </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR A SPECIAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY AND REHABILITATION </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE NETHERLANDS STATED THAT A CLEARER PROPOSAL </p><p>WAS NECESSARY.  HE NOTED THAT OTHER UN AGENCIES ACTIVE IN </p><p>EMERGENCIES "SEEMED TO MANAGE" AND ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A FUND HAD BEEN ONE OF THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS OF LAST YEAR\'S EVALUATION OF FAO\'S EMERGENCY </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  (THE FUNDING IS TO COME FROM, INTER ALIA, </p><p>DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DONORS; RETENTION/TRANSFER OF FUND </p><p>BALANCES AS AUTHORIZED BY DONORS; TRANSFER OF A SHARE OF </p><p>FUNDS FROM THE DIRECT OPERATING COST RECOVERY ACCOUNT.) IS </p><p>IT IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FAO IS ASKING TO SPEND MONEY THEY </p><p>DON\'T REALLY HAVE YET?    UNDER DISCUSSION OF THE COSTS OF </p><p>THE WFS5YL (SOME USD 2 MILLION IN REGULAR BUDGET RESOURCES, </p><p>USD 2 MILLION IN VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS), AUSTRALIA </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT MEMBERS ASK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE REGULAR </p><p>PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF HAVING DIVERTED ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF WFS5YL. MEMBERS ALSO NOTED THAT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR (NON- </p><p>EMERGENCY) TECHNICAL COOPERATION ACTIVITIES HAVE DECLINED </p><p>AND OTHER CHAPTERS OF THE BUDGET WERE BEING CALLED ON TO </p><p>ABSORB THE FIXED COSTS NO LONGER COVERED BY SUPPORT COST </p><p>INCOME.  THIS IS A LONG-TERM PROBLEM WHICH MUST BE </p><p>ADDRESSED. </p><p>(THERE WAS ALSO THE DISCUSSION HERE OF THE LONG TERM PROBLEM </p><p>OF BUILDING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ALL THESE FIELD </p><p>OPERATIONS, BUT NOT HAVING THE BUDGET TO SUPPORT THEM) </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER "BUDGETARY MATTERS," A TOUR DE TABLE OF GENEVA </p><p>GROUP MEMBERS SHOWED THAT THE U.S., JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA HAD </p><p>A ZERO-NOMINAL-GROWTH (ZNG) POSITION.  GERMANY SAID THAT ITS </p><p>POSITION WAS UNCHANGED FROM LAST YEAR (ZNG), NOTING THAT THE </p><p>VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZNG AND ZERO-REAL-GROWTH (ZRG) </p><p>IN THE 2002-2003 BUDGET HAD ULTIMATELY MADE IT EASIER TO </p><p>"SWALLOW" A ZRG BUDGET IN 2001.  THE NETHERLANDS AND </p><p>SWITZERLAND WERE "OPEN TO ZRG." FRANCE NOTED THAT THERE WAS </p><p>NO CONSENSUS IN THE EUROPEAN REGIONAL GROUP (ERG) ON ZNG; </p><p>FRANCE AND BELGIUM WERE WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS: THEY HAVE </p><p>"SYMPATHY FOR ZNG" BUT WERE "DISPOSED TO CONSIDER ZRG."  THE </p><p>U.K. WAS SIMILARLY WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, BUT UNLESS ADVISED </p><p>OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS ZNG.  NEW ZEALAND WAS WITHOUT </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS, NOTED THAT WELLINGTON WAS LOOKING AT ALL UN </p><p>AGENCIES ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BUT NEW ZEALAND\'S </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF ZRG IN 2001 HAD BEEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD REVERT TO A ZNG POSITION FOR THE 2003-2004 </p><p>BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE ITEM ON THE SPLIT CURRENCY ASSESSMENT, THE </p><p>U.K. ARGUED THAT IT NEEDED TO BE SETTLED THIS YEAR, AND </p><p>STATED THAT THE SECRETARIAT RECOMMENDATION WAS A GOOD ONE. </p><p>THE U.S. NOTED THAT THE SPLIT CURRENCY PROPOSAL MOVED </p><p>EXCHANGE RATE RISK TO MEMBERS AND ADVISED THAT WASHINGTON </p><p>DID NOT SUPPORT THE CHANGE.  THE NETHERLANDS RECALLED THAT </p><p>THE EU COORDINATION GROUP POLICY WAS TO HAVE UN AGENCIES </p><p>BASED IN EUROPE CAST THEIR BUDGETS IN EUROS, BUT THEY "COULD </p><p>GO" WITH A SPLIT ASSESSMENT.  UNDER SCALE OF ASSESSMENTS IT </p><p>WAS NOTED THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAD OBJECTED TO THEIR NEW </p><p>ASSESSED RATE WOULD PROBABLY RAISE THE ISSUE AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  UNDER "HUMAN RESOURCES MATTERS" MANY DELEGATES </p><p>COMPLAINED ABOUT THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH APPLICANTS </p><p>AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE FAO RECRUITMENT PROCESS </p><p>WHICH THEN OBLIGED PERMANENT REPRESENTATIONS TO SEEK ANSWERS </p><p>TO QUESTIONS THAT APPLICANTS COULD NOT THEMSELVES OBTAIN </p><p>FROM THE FAO PERSONNEL OFFICE.  THE NETHERLANDS NOTED THAT </p><p>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIONS NEEDED TO BE ASCERTAINING WHETHER </p><p>THE FAO "IS FOLLOWING ITS OWN RULES."   THE U.S. SAID THAT </p><p>IT WOULD NOT SUPPORT A PROPOSED CHANGE OF THE METHODOLOGY </p><p>FOR DETERMINING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, NOTING THAT THE </p><p>PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO WOULD VASTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT WERE "EQUITABLY REPRESENTED" AND SHRINK THE </p><p>NUMBER OF "OVERREPRESENTED" COUNTRIES.  THE U.S. ALSO </p><p>QUESTIONED THE CRITERIA FOR SEEKING "EQUITABLE REGIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION." JAPAN SUPPORTED THE SECOND METHODOLOGY, </p><p>ARGUING THAT IT WOULD RENDER EVEN MORE DRAMATIC JAPANESE </p><p>UNDERREPRESENTATION.  OTHER COUNTRIES DID NOT COMMENT, BUT </p><p>APPEARED TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SUGGESTION OF THE UK </p><p>THAT A DECISION WAS UNLIKELY TO BE REACHED AT THE CURRENT </p><p>FINANCE COMMITTEE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE </p><p>----------------- </p><p>9.  GG MEMBERS FOCUSED ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET AND </p><p>THE QUESTION OF SETTING PRIORITIES.  THE NETHERLANDS NOTED </p><p>THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE CONSENSUS WITHIN THE MEMBERSHIP THAT </p><p>NORMATIVE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED (SUCH AS THE </p><p>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION AND THE INTERIM COMMISSION ON </p><p>PHYTOSANITARY MATTERS (ICPM)); THE REAL GROWTH BUDGET </p><p>RESPONDED TO THIS CALL BY MEMBERS, BUT THE SECRETARIAT </p><p>THREATENED TO CUT BACK THOSE ACTIVITIES IF FORCED TO MOVE TO </p><p>ZRG OR ZNG: WAS THIS AN APPROPRIATE REACTION TO THE </p><p>PRIORITIES EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS?  THE U.K. AGREED THAT </p><p>PRIORITIES SHOULD BE "BUDGET BLIND," I.E., YOU SET YOUR </p><p>PRIORITIES AND THEN APPLY IT TO WHATEVER BUDGET LEVEL TO </p><p>WHICH YOU FINALLY AGREE.  AUSTRALIA NOTED THE NEED TO LINK </p><p>PRIORITIES WITH RESULTS AND EVALUATION.  NEW ZEALAND ARGUED </p><p>THAT MEMBERS HAD STATED CLEARLY THROUGH ALL OF THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE BODIES AND MECHANISMS THAT ICPM NEEDED MORE </p><p>RESOURCES: HOW COULD THE FAO\'S ZRG BUDGET REDUCE THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY?  HOW ELSE WERE MEMBERS TO PRIORITIZE?  IN </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE FAO PAPER ON "PRIORITY SETTING", MEMBERS </p><p>AGREED THAT IT WAS A VALID BASIS TO START FROM BUT NEEDED TO </p><p>BE TAKEN MUCH FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  UNDER THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE EVALUATION OF THE SPECIAL </p><p>PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS), PC MEMBERS NOTED THAT THEY </p><p>HAD VERY CLEARLY TOLD THE SECRETARIAT TO TIGHTEN UP THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE EXPANDING; THE SECRETARIAT HAD </p><p>EXPANDED IT NONETHELESS.  THE NETHERLANDS ARGUED THAT THERE </p><p>WAS SO MUCH G-77 SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM, THE BEST WE CAN DO </p><p>IS MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS APPROVED, AND KEEP A </p><p>CAP ON THE BUDGET LEVEL.  THE UK STATED THAT THE PC -- THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE BODY WITHIN FAO TO ADDRESS SUCH AN ISSUE --  HAD </p><p>BEEN IGNORED. THIS AND OTHER POINTS RAISED IN PARA 10 RAISED </p><p>THE QUESTIONS OF WHO SETS PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>AND HOW TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC CHANGE WITHIN FAO. </p><p> </p><p>JOINT MEETING OF FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>11.  UNDER THE ITEM "INDEPENDENCE OF THE EVALUATION UNIT", </p><p>SWITZERLAND ARGUED THAT THE RECENT CHANGE AT IFAD IN THIS </p><p>REGARD GAVE A POSITIVE EXAMPLE TO WORK FROM.  SWITZERLAND </p><p>SAID THAT HE COULD NOT ENDORSE THE PAPER AS WRITTEN: THE </p><p>EVALUATION UNIT SHOULD REPORT DIRECTLY TO COUNCIL, SHOULD </p><p>WORK CLOSELY WITH THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE, SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN </p><p>BUDGET, FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STAFF, AND THE DIRECTOR </p><p>SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY THE FAO COUNCIL.  ALL GG MEMBERS AGREED </p><p>THAT GREATER INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE GOOD; THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>NOTED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (IFI\'S) </p><p>HAD THIS, BUT WITHIN THE UN SYSTEM IT WAS HARD TO FIND A </p><p>MODEL.  HE ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE "FEEDBACK LOOP" </p><p>TO PROGRAM MANAGEMENT.  MEMBERS AGREED THAT THE THERE WAS NO </p><p>NEED TO MERGE THE AUDIT AND EVALUATION UNITS.  THE UK ASKED </p><p>ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN EVALUATION UNIT AND THE </p><p>CONTINUAL "AUTO-EVALUATION" THAT PROGRAM MANAGERS ARE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE GG DISCUSSED "REFORM OF DEBATE" AT THE GENERAL </p><p>CONFERENCE (GC).  NEW ZEALAND (WHOSE MINISTER WILL CHAIR THE </p><p>GC) SAID THAT HIS DELEGATION STRONGLY SUPPORTED AN </p><p>INTERACTIVE FORMAT.  HE SAID THAT ROUNDTABLES SHOULD BE ON </p><p>INTERESTING TOPICS, SMALL, AND GIVE MINISTERS AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>FOR GIVE AND TAKE.  THE NETHERLANDS SAID THAT HE WAS </p><p>"GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE" BUT NOTED THAT SOME ERG MEMBERS HAD </p><p>HAD PROBLEMS COVERING THE PROLIFERATION OF SIDE EVENTS AT </p><p>THE WFS5YL.  IN CONCLUSION, MEMBERS AGREED THAT THEY WOULD </p><p>ASK FOR MORE ALTERNATIVES THAN THE TWO PRESENTED BY THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT IN THE DOCUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>13.  TURNING TO THE JIU REVIEW OF FAO MANAGEMENT, THE U.S. </p><p>CALLED ATTENTION TO THE CRITICISM OF FAO REGIONAL OFFICES </p><p>(PARTICULARLY GERMANE GIVEN THAT THE FAO WAS SEEKING MORE </p><p>MONEY FOR FAO LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES.)  THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>STATED THAT FAO MIGHT LEARN FROM UNDP, WHICH HAD A GOOD </p><p>PROCESS FOR SELECTING LOCAL REPS; WHO HAS A COUNTRY "FOCUS </p><p>INITIATIVE" WHICH COULD BE EMULATED.  THE GROUP AGREED THAT </p><p>THE JIU RECOMMENDATIONS COULD WELL FORM THE BASIS FOR FUTURE </p><p>FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE AGENDAS, GIVEN THE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>ISSUES RAISED CONCERNING STAFF SELECTION, HUMAN RESOURCES </p><p>MANAGEMENT, DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS AND FINANCES AND </p><p>PERFORMANCE BASED ALLOCATION.  MEMBERS AGREED THAT THE </p><p>REPORT OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE SHOULD BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE </p><p>IN STATING THAT THE MANAGEMENT RESPONSE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY </p><p>AND ASKING FOR A PLAN OF ACTION (WITH TIMING) ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS.
