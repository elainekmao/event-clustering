<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, PGOV, PREL, CA, Canadian Military </p><p>SUBJECT: DEFENSE MINISTER MCCALLUM AND THE CANADIAN FORCES </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 178 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Nine months into his tenure as Minister, John McCallum </p><p>is starting to put his mark on the Department of National </p><p>Defense.  He was able to get a greater-than-expected increase </p><p>in defense spending in the latest GoC budget, and he has </p><p>announced a defense review to guide transformation of the </p><p>Canadian Forces.  McCallum\'s economics background and </p><p>determination to find savings have helped him in Cabinet, </p><p>specifically in the budget battle.  His limited political and </p><p>military experience has shown at times, and has caused some </p><p>friction with the Canadian Forces and defense advocates.  But </p><p>McCallum has greater strategic vision and influence in </p><p>Cabinet than his recent predecessors, and he is a consistent </p><p>advocate for strengthening the U.S.-Canada defense </p><p>relationship.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>BUDGET VICTORY </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GoC budget announced on February 18 was a real </p><p>victory for McCallum, though he has gotten little credit from </p><p>defense advocates here because the needs are so much greater. </p><p> The baseline defense budget increased by US$533 million per </p><p>year (from US$7.9 billion in the 2002-2003 budget) for three </p><p>years, and McCallum has promised US$133 million per year in </p><p>administrative savings (e.g., greater efficiency in </p><p>procurements).  McCallum argues that one-fourth of all </p><p>incremental spending in the 2003-2004 GoC budget went to </p><p>defense, and that he could not have gotten more given </p><p>competing domestic priorities (especially health care). </p><p>McCallum asserts that DND got all that he was asking for, and </p><p>all that it could use efficiently in 2003-2004.  While we </p><p>disagree with his argument that more was not justified - </p><p>especially given the upcoming deployments to ISAF IV and V - </p><p>his point about the limits on defense spending in the </p><p>Chretien Government is certainly valid. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Under these circumstances, McCallum did well in the </p><p>2003-2004 budget, but you would never have known it from his </p><p>address to the Conference of Defense Associations (CDA) on </p><p>February 27.  McCallum grew visibly agitated as he fielded </p><p>one critical comment after another about the budget and the </p><p>pending deployment to Aghanistan.  The audience\'s mood was </p><p>not helped by the disclosure earlier in the week that the new </p><p>budget eliminates future funding for the CDA.  It is not yet </p><p>clear whether this was simply a cost-cutting measure, or </p><p>retribution for an organization that has loudly criticized </p><p>the GoC\'s defense program for years. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>OVERSTRETCHED CANADIAN FORCES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While McCallum will not lose any sleep over veterans </p><p>organizations, he does have to concern himself with Canadian </p><p>Forces\' morale.  McCallum admitted to the CDA audience that </p><p>some in the Army were unhappy over the decision to deploy to </p><p>Afghanistan.  Many in the Canadian Forces would have prefered </p><p>a GoC commitment to contribute land forces in Iraq, and the </p><p>size and duration of the ISAF commitment - a battalion and </p><p>brigade headquarters for 12 months - will exacerbate the </p><p>military\'s biggest problem, operational tempo.  The Canadian </p><p>Forces leadership was also upset because it had little or no </p><p>advance warning of McCallum\'s February 12 ISAF announcement. </p><p>Chief of Defense Staff GEN Henault told the CDA that the </p><p>"content" came as no surprise, though it did lead one senior </p><p>officer - MGEN Cam Ross, DND Director General of </p><p>International Security Policy - to resign in protest. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On the positive side, McCallum has made a concerted </p><p>effort to bolster the U.S.-Canada defense relationship, which </p><p>is crucial for the Canadian Forces.  He pushed through a 2002 </p><p>agreement for a binational, counterterrorist Planning Group </p><p>at NORAD, despite sovereignty concerns in Ottawa, and has </p><p>forced missile defense cooperation onto the Cabinet\'s agenda </p><p>(outcome still to be determined). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Within a divided Cabinet, McCallum has also advocated </p><p>keeping open the option of military participation in Iraq - </p><p>i.e., naval or air assets already in theater - without a </p><p>second UNSC resolution.  McCallum got burned, however, when </p><p>he publicly stated that this was GoC policy after his January </p><p>9 meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.  McCallum had it </p><p>right, but Chretien has not wanted to admit publicly that </p><p>Canada might act without UN blessing.  After Chretien reined </p><p>him in (reftel), McCallum overreacted by ordering Canadian </p><p>military planners at CENTCOM to not attend a coalition </p><p>planning meeting the following week.  This unnecessary </p><p>action, which did not reflect any change in GoC policy, </p><p>damaged Canada\'s credibility for Iraq planning in Tampa and </p><p>in Washington. </p><p>-------------- </p><p>DEFENSE REVIEW </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Shortly after becoming Defense Minister, McCallum </p><p>directed DND to undertake a "defense update" focused on </p><p>immediate needs for the 2003-2004 budget cycle.  As GEN </p><p>Henault describes it, funding increases in the latest budget </p><p>allow the Canadian Forces to shift their focus from </p><p>survivability to sustainability.  The next step will be </p><p>transformation, and McCallum has said that a full-scale </p><p>"defense review" will be conducted to guide that process. </p><p>McCallum cautions that this may or may not result in </p><p>increased funding for the military, but that it should point </p><p>the way on bigger procurement decisions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) On one of the military\'s biggest needs, strategic </p><p>lift, McCallum has publicly stated that a stand-alone </p><p>Canadian purchase of C-17s is not in the cards.  His </p><p>reasoning is that given limited GoC funding, purchasing C-17s </p><p>would gut the defense budget, making it impossible to meet </p><p>other needs.  Instead, DND is looking into a combined </p><p>purchase of C-17s with NATO allies.  McCallum has also </p><p>expressed doubts over the continued need for tanks, so long </p><p>as the Army has some direct-fire capability (e.g., the </p><p>planned U.S. combat system/mobile gun system).  McCallum did, </p><p>in the latest budget, allocate US$467 million in funding over </p><p>the next ten years for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target </p><p>Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LIBERAL PARTY LEGACY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) One procurement issue that continues to haunt the GoC </p><p>is a replacement for its Sea King maritime helicopters, which </p><p>entered service in 1963.  In the 1993 campaign, Chretien </p><p>attacked the Tory Government\'s plans to purchase EH-101 </p><p>maritime helicopters as extravagant.  After the election </p><p>Chretien cancelled the deal, and he has stymied subsequent </p><p>DND efforts to let a new contract.  Meanwhile, the Sea Kings </p><p>continue to diminish the Canadian Navy\'s effectiveness.  The </p><p>latest example came on February 27 when the Canadian </p><p>Destroyer HMCS Iroquois, headed for a Canadian-led, combined </p><p>naval task force in the Persian Gulf, had to return to </p><p>Halifax after its Sea King crashed onto the deck.  The </p><p>Iroquois set sail again on March 5, this time with no </p><p>helicopter, </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Sea King fiasco is a reminder of the challenges </p><p>the Canadian Forces will continue to face in Ottawa.  While </p><p>Chretien is set to step down in February 2004, we expect the </p><p>Liberal Party to remain in power for the foreseeable future. </p><p>While Chretien\'s successor - probably ex-Finance Minister </p><p>Paul Martin - may be better disposed toward the Canadian </p><p>Forces, he is also unlikely to make dramatic increases to the </p><p>defense budget.  McCallum and his successors will have to </p><p>continue to make incremental moves and plenty of hard </p><p>choices.  The hope here is that a defense review can be ready </p><p>to go soon after Chretien leaves office, and that the next </p><p>Prime Minister will be more supportive of the Canadian Forces. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
