<p>UNCLAS VANCOUVER 000819 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, PREL, PTER, XD, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: AIR INDIA "TRIAL OF THE CENTURY" CONTINUES IN VANCOUVER </p><p> </p><p>    1. SUMMARY:  THE TRIAL OF TWO SUSPECTS IN THE 1985 BOMBING OF </p><p>AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182, WHICH BEGAN IN FEBRUARY, CONTINUES AT THE </p><p>BRITISH COLUMBIA SUPREME COURT.  THE AIR INDIA CASE IS THE </p><p>LARGEST CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN CANADIAN HISTORY AND THE TRIAL </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO BE UNPRECEDENTED IN LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY. IT IS </p><p>ESTIMATED IT WILL LAST WELL INTO 2004.  THE RCMP HAS </p><p>INVESTIGATED THE CASE FOR 18 YEARS.  ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE THAT </p><p>SECTORS OF THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IGNORED CLUES THAT MAY HAVE </p><p>PREVENTED THE BOMBING.  THE TRIAL HAS BEEN ADJOURNED UNTIL </p><p>SEPTEMBER 8TH, 2003. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. BACKGROUND: ON JUNE 23, 1985, AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 FROM </p><p>MONTREAL TO LONDON, CARRYING LUGGAGE LOADED IN VANCOUVER, </p><p>EXPLODED AND CRASHED INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 240 KILOMETERS OFF </p><p>THE COAST OF IRELAND. ALL 329 PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE KILLED. </p><p>FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES EARLIER, A SUITCASE LOADED IN VANCOUVER ONTO </p><p>CANADIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 003 EXPLODED IN THE AIRPORT AT NARITA, </p><p>JAPAN. THE SUITCASE WAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO AIR INDIA FLIGHT </p><p>301 TO BANGKOK AND DELHI. TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS WERE KILLED AND </p><p>FOUR OTHER PERSONS INJURED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POLICE ALLEGE VANCOUVER MILLIONAIRE RIPUDAMAN SINGH MALIK </p><p>AND AJAIB SINGH BAGRI PLANNED TO BOMB FLIGHT 182 AS PART OF A </p><p>TERRORISM CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH MEN WERE </p><p>ALLEGED SIKH SEPARATISTS PLOTTING AGAINST THE NATIONAL AIRLINE </p><p>OF INDIA IN RETALIATION FOR THE INDIAN ARMY\'S ATTACK A YEAR </p><p>EARLIER ON THE GOLDEN TEMPLE AT AMRITSAR, SIKHISM\'S HOLIEST </p><p>SHRINE. THE SUSPECTED MASTERMIND WAS TALWINDER SINGH PARMAR, A </p><p>MILITANT SIKH RELIGIOUS LEADER IN VANCOUVER. HOWEVER, HE WAS </p><p>NEVER CHARGED WITH MURDER AS PUNJABI POLICE KILLED HIM IN 1992. </p><p>ON OCTOBER 27, 2000, MALIK AND BAGRI WERE ARRESTED IN RELATION </p><p>TO THE BOMBINGS; THEY WERE CHARGED JOINTLY WITH EIGHT COUNTS </p><p>INCLUDING MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER AND CONSPIRACY. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK ON AIR INDIA WAS WIDELY KNOWN IN </p><p>THE WEEKS BEFORE THE AIR INDIA BOMBING. MANY B.C. SIKHS HAD </p><p>CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE AIRLINE.  THE VANCOUVER SUN REPORTED </p><p>IN OCTOBER 2000 THAT PARMAR MADE A FIERY SPEECH AT A SIKH TEMPLE </p><p>IN SOUTHEAST CALGARY IN THE SUMMER OF 1984 THAT AIR INDIA PLANES </p><p>WOULD "FALL FROM THE SKY." PARMAR\'S MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED </p><p>PRIVATELY TO A GROUP OF ABOUT 20 WHO GATHERED IN THE TEMPLE TO </p><p>HEAR THE FOUNDER OF ONE OF THE MOST MILITANT SIKH SEPARATIST </p><p>GROUPS -- THE BABBAR KHALSA OR TIGERS OF THE TRUE FAITH. </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE LOCAL PRESS HAS DESCRIBED A CONTROVERSY THAT HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) AND </p><p>CANADIAN INTELLIGENCE (CSIS) OVER THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>PREVENTED.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MONTHS BEFORE THE </p><p>BOMBING THE RCMP INVESTIGATED A TIP THAT AN AIR INDIA PLANE OUT </p><p>OF MONTREAL WOULD BE BOMBED. THE RCMP ASKED CSIS FOR A THREAT </p><p>ASSESSMENT ON ITS LIKELIHOOD.  POLICE CRITICS SUGGEST THAT CSIS </p><p>IGNORED CLUES THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE BOMBING.  THERE HAVE </p><p>ALSO BEEN ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE WAS A CSIS MOLE WORKING WITH </p><p>THE ALLEGED BOMBING CONSPIRATORS. HOWEVER, THE RCMP AND THE CSIS </p><p>HAVE BOTH DENIED THESE ALLEGATIONS.  THE AIR INDIA TRIAL IS </p><p>CERTAIN TO GENERATE CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DEBATE, MULTIPLE </p><p>CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND ABUNDANT CRITICISM OF FORMER AND CURRENT </p><p>PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS IT PROCEEDS OVER THE COMING YEAR OR MORE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARREAGA </p><p></p></div>
