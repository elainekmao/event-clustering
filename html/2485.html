DEFMIN ANTONIO MARTINO TOLD BURNS THAT ITALY IS </p><p>PREPARED TO TAKE COMMAND OF TFF FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, SHOULD </p><p>THAT BE NECESSARY.  HE NOTED THAT EU DEFENSE MINISTERS DO NOT </p><p>SHARE THE ENTHUSIASM OF EU FOREIGN MINISTERS FOR A FOLLOW-ON </p><p>EU COMMAND FOR TFF.  ITALIAN OFFICIALS ALSO EXPLORED THE IDEA </p><p>OF TIMING A CELEBRATION OF THE CREATION OF THE NATO-RUSSIA </p><p>COUNCIL TO COINCIDE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH\'S TRIP TO MOSCOW IN </p><p>LATE MAY.  BURNS SUGGESTED THAT POLDIR ARAGONA RAISE THE </p><p>ISSUE DURING HIS FEBRUARY 11-12 VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DEFMIN MARTINO </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2. (C) WHILE IN ROME TO GIVE THE GRADUATION SPEECH AT THE </p><p>NATO DEFENSE COLLEGE, USNATO AMBASSADOR BURNS MET WITH </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO AND OTHER SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM THE MFA, MOD, PRIME MINISTER\'S AND PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, </p><p>AS WELL AS JOURNALISTS AND POLITICAL LEADERS, IN A SERIES OF </p><p>MEETINGS AND ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS.  IN A FEBRUARY 8 </p><p>MEETING, DEFMIN MARTINO CONFIRMED THAT ITALY IS PREPARED TO </p><p>TAKE THE LEAD ON TFF FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, IF REQUESTED. </p><p>MARTINO AGREED WITH BURNS THAT THE SITUATION IN MACEDONIA IS </p><p>FLUID AND ADMITTED THAT WORKING WITH THE MACEDONIANS CAN BE </p><p>UNPREDICTIBLE.  BURNS SAID THE USG WILL SUPPORT AN EXTENSION </p><p>OF TFF FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS, BUT WOULD NEED TO REVIEW AN </p><p>EXTENSION OF SIX MONTHS.  THE US IS OPEN TO DISCUSSING A </p><p>SHIFT IN COMMAND FROM NATO TO THE EU, SHOULD THE MANDATE NEED </p><p>TO BE EXTENDED AGAIN, BUT HAD NOT MADE ANY FIRM DECISIONS, </p><p>BURNS SAID.  HE POINTED OUT THAT, AT NATO, BRITAIN, GERMANY </p><p>AND THE NETHERLANDS ARE RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT AN EU COMMAND </p><p>UNTIL ALL THE BERLIN-PLUS ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MET. MARTINO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00721  01 OF 02  131347Z </p><p>NOTED THAT, UNLIKE THE "FOREIGN MINISTERS\' CLUB," THE </p><p>"DEFENSE MINISTERS\' CLUB" IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO SHIFTING </p><p>COMMAND FROM NATO TO THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BURNS COMMENTED ON THE DISTURBING CAPABILITIES GAP </p><p>BETWEEN THE US AND NATO ALLIES, AND POINTED TO LORD </p><p>ROBERTSON\'S SUGGESTION TO PARE DOWN THE DCI\'S 58 SPENDING </p><p>PRIORITIES TO A MORE MANAGEABLE FIVE OR SIX.  IF THE CORE </p><p>NATO ALLIES FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING CAPABILITIES SUCH AS </p><p>STRATEGIC LIFT, SPECIAL OPS FORCES, PRECISION GUIDED </p><p>MUNITIONS AND SECURE COMMUNICATIONS, NATO WOULD HAVE THE </p><p>FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO ASYMMETRICAL THREATS AS WELL AS </p><p>CONVENTIONAL ONES.  MARTINO, AN ECONOMIST BY TRAINING, </p><p>ADMITTED THAT EUROPE HAS HAD A FREE RIDE FROM THE US FOR THE </p><p>PAST 50 YEARS.  INCREASED DEFENSE SPENDING WILL HAVE TO BE </p><p>FINANCED BY INCREASED TAXATION -- NOT A PALATABLE OPTION, </p><p>MARTINO SAID.  NATO NOT ONLY NEEDS TO REDUCE ITS PRIORITIES, </p><p>ITS MEMBERS NEED TO SPEND AVAILABLE FUNDS MORE EFFICIENTLY, </p><p>HE SAID.  ALONG THESE LINES, MARTINO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S PARTICIPATION IN JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, AND ADDED THAT </p><p>JSF IS AN OPPORTUNITY ITALY CAN\'T AFFORD TO MISS.  HE AGREED </p><p>THAT ITALIAN INDUSTRY DEMANDS ARE STALLING COMPLETION OF THE </p><p>DEAL, AND SAID NATIONAL ARMAMENTS DIRECTOR ADMIRAL DIPAOLA </p><p>MAY MAKE SOME HEADWAY WHILE IN WASHINGTON DURING THE WEEK OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 11. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MARTINO ADMITTED THAT NATO ENLARGEMENT WILL BE A </p><p>CHALLENGE BUT TOLD BURNS THAT BRINGING ROMANIA AND BULGARIA </p><p>IN IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BALKANS REGION.  THEY WANT TO FEEL A </p><p>PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AND IT WILL BE </p><p>HARD FOR THEM TO BE LEFT BEHIND IF SLOVENIA AND SLOVAKIA ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00721  01 OF 02  131347Z </p><p>ADMITTED, MARTINO SAID.  BURNS EXPLAINED THAT THE USG WANTS </p><p>TO DELAY DECIDING WHICH COUNTRIES WILL BE ADMITTED UNTIL LATE </p><p>FALL IN ORDER TO GIVE CANDIDATES AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>MAKE THE NECESSARY REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>POLDIR ARAGONA </p><p>-------------- </p><p>5. (C)  AMBASSADOR BURNS HEARD A SIMILAR MESSAGE ON </p><p>ENLARGEMENT FROM MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR GIANCARLO ARAGONA </p><p>DURING A FEBRUARY 7 MEETING. ARAGONA SAID ADMITTING TWO OR </p><p>SEVEN OF THE NINE ASPIRANTS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE BUT ADMITTING </p><p>FIVE WOULD BE DIFFICULT.  STRENGTHENING SE EUROPE IS A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL INTEREST FOR ITALY, HE SAID.  ALBANIA </p><p>AND MACEDONIA ARE NOT READY FOR MEMBERSHIP, BUT BRINGING </p><p>ROMANIA AND BULGARIA IN WOULD STABILIZE THE REGION AND HELP </p><p>SPUR NECESSARY REFORMS.  BURNS NOTED THAT AN INTERAGENCY TEAM </p><p>WOULD BE TRAVELING TO THE ASPIRANT COUNTRIES IN FEBRUARY TO </p><p>EVALUATE HOW TO HELP THEM TOWARD MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN CONTRAST TO MARTINO, ARAGONA SAID THAT ITALY </p><p>SUPPORTS AN EU COMMAND OF TFF EVENTUALLY, AS A TEST OF </p><p>EU-NATO SYNERGY.  IF ALLIES AGREE TO ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1826 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00721  02 OF 02  131347Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  PM-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  NFAT-00  SAS-00     /000W </p><p>                  ------------------663BBA  131354Z /38 </p><p>O 131322Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 2119 </p><p>INFO ALL NATO POST COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000721 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: NATO, MARR, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR BURNS BRIEFS ITALIANS ON NATO ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>OF BERLIN-PLUS, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO SHIFT TO AN EU </p><p>COMMAND EVEN IF A FORMAL AGREEMENT IS NOT IN PLACE, ARAGONA </p><p>SUGGESTED.  BURNS NOTED USG WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS EU COMMAND </p><p>OF TFF.  WITH ARAGONA AND OTHERS, HE EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR </p><p>THE EU TO DISCUSS ITS AMBITIONS NOT ONLY INTERNALLY BUT ALSO </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH THE MACEDONIANS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ARAGONA TOLD BURNS THAT PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI </p><p>SHARES PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ENTHUSIASM FOR IMPROVED NATO-RUSSIA </p><p>RELATIONS.  ARAGONA SAID BERLUSCONI FAVORS HOLDING AN EVENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00721  02 OF 02  131347Z </p><p>TO CELEBRATE THE CREATION OF THE NATO-RUSSIA COUNCIL AFTER </p><p>THE NATO FM\'S MEETING IN REYKJAVIK.  ON FEBRUARY 4, DEFMIN </p><p>MARTINO HAD REPEATED AN EARLIER ITALIAN INVITATION TO HOST </p><p>SUCH AN EVENT.  ASSEMBLING A HIGH-LEVEL MEETING MIGHT BE </p><p>EASIER IF IT WERE TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>TRIP TO MOSCOW MAY 23-26, ARAGONA SAID.  BURNS NOTED THAT THE </p><p>US BELIEVED IT TOO EARLY TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT SUCH A </p><p>SUMMIT AND SUGGESTED ARAGONA MENTION IT DURING HIS UPCOMING </p><p>VISIT.  OTHER POSSIBLE DATES FOR AN INAUGURAL EVENT ARE THE </p><p>REYKJAVIK FM\'S MEETING MAY 14-16 OR THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>THE FOUNDING ACT ON MAY 27, BURNS SAID.  THE CZECH\'S WERE </p><p>LIKELY TO OBJECT TO HOLDING AN EVENT TOO CLOSE TO THE PRAGUE </p><p>SUMMIT IN NOVEMBER, HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BURNS\' LUNCHEON WITH SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS FEATURED </p><p>SIMILAR THEMES.  PARTICPIANTS INCLUDED PRESIDENT CIAMPI\'S </p><p>SENIOR DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, PURI PURINI; PM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>SENIOR MILITARY ADVISOR, GEN. TRICARICO; MOD DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR GRECO; VICE CHOD CAMPORINI; AND MFA SENIOR SECURITY </p><p>ADVISOR PENSA.  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT NATO </p><p>COUNTRIES NEED TO INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING AND SPEND THOSE </p><p>FUNDS MORE EFFICIENTLY.  THE OFFICIALS ALSO AGREED THAT NATO </p><p>NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE FLEXIBLY TO UNCONVENTIONAL </p><p>THREATS AS WELL AS TO THE CONVENTIONAL THREATS THAT HAVE BEEN </p><p>THE BASIS FOR THE ALLIANCE.  GENERAL CAMPORINI NOTED THAT </p><p>COMMAND STRUCTURE LIMITATIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR NATO TO </p><p>DEPLOY TROOPS QUICKLY.  IN DISCUSSING TFF COMMAND, CAMPORINI </p><p>FLOATED THE IDEA THAT ITALY COULD ASSUME COMMAND OF TFF UNDER </p><p>A NATO FLAG, AND THAT THE TRANSITION TO AN EU MISSION COULD </p><p>COME AT THE HALFWAY POINT OF THE ITALIAN COMMAND. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00721  02 OF 02  131347Z </p><p>9. (C) THROUGHOUT AMB. BURNS\' MEETINGS, GOI OFFICIALS SENT A </p><p>CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGE OF A CLOSE ALLY THAT IS FULLY </p><p>WILLING -- AND AT TIMES EAGER -- TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH </p><p>THE US ON POL-MIL AFFAIRS.  BUILDING UPON ONGOING SUPPORT FOR </p><p>OEF AND THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT\'S CLOSE COLLABORATION DURING </p><p>THE KOSOVO CAMPAIGN, KEY PLAYERS IN BERLUSCONI\'S GOVERNMENT </p><p>ARE SEEKING AVENUES OF COOPERATION RANGING FROM MD TO </p><p>NATO-RUSSIA TO DEFENSE-INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION.  SUCH </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES HAVE THEIR LIMITS, AS THE CENTER-RIGHT GOI </p><p>PURSUES ITS OWN CONCEPT OF NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST.  BUT THEY </p><p>ARE REAL.  WITH THE GOI\'S DEEPENING SENSE THAT KEY EUROPEAN </p><p>"PARTNERS\' ARE UNWILLING TO GIVE ITALY ITS DUE, THE US HAS A </p><p>UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FOSTER EVEN CLOSER GOI-USG COOPERATION, </p><p>BOTH WITHIN THE ALLIANCE AND BILATERALLY. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) AMBASSADOR BURNS HAS CLEARED THIS MESSAGE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00721 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
