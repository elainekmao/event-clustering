<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SEVEN U.S. COMPANIES BID FOR NATIONAL ID </p><p>CARD PROJECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: CARRIG-WALKER EMAIL 6/25/01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Seven U.S. companies, in two separate </p><p>consortia, made oral presentations for a USD 200 million </p><p>national identification card project on June 28.  The actual </p><p>presentation of bid proposals appeared to be open and </p><p>transparent, with a total of four consortia competing for the </p><p>bid.  However, is alleged that the French government may be </p><p>placing intense pressure on the GON to choose the French </p><p>consortium.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. On June 28, Ambassador Jeter and EconOffs attended the </p><p>oral presentations of seven U.S. companies (in two consortia) </p><p>in their bid for the national identification card project, </p><p>worth approximately USD 200 million.  All four consortia </p><p>presented their proposals in front of a wide audience of GON </p><p>officials and interested diplomatic representatives.  GON </p><p>officials included President Obasanjo, Vice President </p><p>Abubakar, the Minister, Deputy Minster, and Permanent </p><p>Secretary for Internal Affairs, Chief of the Independent </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>National Electoral Commission, and Senate Chairman of the </p><p>Committee on National Identification Cards. Post was </p><p>encouraged by the open and transparent manner in which the </p><p>bidding process was conducted, and the lively questioning </p><p>that ensued following the presentations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Per Ref email, DOC earlier had advised Ambassador Jeter </p><p>to represent Datacard and Polaroid, as the only U.S. concerns </p><p>for the project, at the June 28 presentation.  To demonstrate </p><p>USG support for Datacard\'s bid, Ambassador Jeter prepared a </p><p>letter to Vice President Abubakar on behalf of the company. </p><p>However, the letter went undelivered because the Ambassador </p><p>discovered, after arriving at the presentation venue, that </p><p>there were in fact five other U.S. companies bidding for the </p><p>project as partners in the Mint/Crest consortium.  These </p><p>companies are East Shore Technologies, NCS Pearson, Omicron, </p><p>Oracle, and IBM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. President Obasanjo commented, as an aside, that only three </p><p>of the four consortia are competitive: Crest/Mint, Chams </p><p>(Datacard and Polaroid), and a consortium of French </p><p>companies.  The Government of France (GOF) appears to be very </p><p>active in promoting its companies in the tendering process. </p><p>During the course of the presentations, several of the U.S. </p><p>companies commented to Ambassador Jeter that the GOF was </p><p>putting significant pressure on the GON on behalf of the </p><p>French consortium.  For example, one company representative </p><p>suggested that the French government had offered bilateral </p><p>debt cancellation in exchange for award of the contract. </p><p>Moreover, the French Foreign Minister arrived in Abuja that </p><p>same evening on a long scheduled visit, and upon arrival </p><p>would undoubtedly be in a position to pressure the GON to </p><p>accept the French bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment.  Unfortunately, Post was not informed in advance </p><p>of five of the seven U.S. companies bidding for the national </p><p>ID project and, therefore, the Ambassador was unable to </p><p>provide a specific endorsement of any one or combination of </p><p>U.S. companies.  As it turned out, Ambassador Jeter who sat </p><p>just left of President Obasanjo, felt compelled to stay for </p><p>all of the U.S. companies\' presentations, a total of about </p><p>seven hours.  In his statement, Ambassador Jeter said that </p><p>all of the U.S. companies represented were eminently </p><p>qualified for this project and expressed the hope that there </p><p>would be American participation.  The companies present </p><p>seemed satisfied with the approach and expressed deep </p><p>gratitude for an Embassy presence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment Continued: Post is encouraged by President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s efforts to make the bidding process open and </p><p>transparent for this high profile national project (one </p><p>dogged, unfortunately, with extensive allegations of waste </p><p>and corruption for years).  The tendering process, at least </p><p>at this semi-public event, appears to have been on a level </p><p>playing field.  A Statehouse official told the Ambassador on </p><p>June 29 that President Obasanjo and his team will take a few </p><p>weeks to assess their findings and impressions and will make </p><p>an announcement of their decision at such time.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
