<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 002817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PTER, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ AND TURKEY: GOT SAYS SHIFTING FOCUS FROM </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE TO TRADE AND AID, WANT TO DEVELOP </p><p>RELATIONS W/IRAQI KURDS, GET TURKMEN TO INTEGRATE </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) According to MFA Iraq Department Head Kerim Uras </p><p>(strictly protect), the GOT held a coordination meeting on </p><p>Iraq policy April 26 at which MFA, TNIO and TGS reps agreed </p><p>that Turkey should concentrate more on trade with and aid to </p><p>Iraq, and less on the military issues surrounding the Iraqi </p><p>border.  Uras said there was a broadly shared perception at </p><p>the meeting that due to Kurdish participation with US forces </p><p>in OIF, the US was increasingly listening to the Iraqi Kurds </p><p>and marginalizing the role of Turkey in northern Iraq.  He </p><p>said that while Turkey had been unhappy with Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>behavior at the time Kirkuk and Mosul fell, things were </p><p>getting back on track, and the Turks were calm and determined </p><p>to further develop their relations with the Iraqi Kurds, </p><p>especially via trade.  Uras said the MFA was considering </p><p>sending a delegation to northern Iraq in the near future </p><p>(Deputy U/S Ali Tuygan was scheduled to go there April 10 but </p><p>canceled over developments in Kirkuk). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) On the Iraqi Turkmen, Uras said the meeting assessed </p><p>that slowly the Iraqi Turkmen Front was getting its act </p><p>together but had weak leadership.  The ITF should become more </p><p>aware that it must behave as a component of the new Iraq, </p><p>which required establishing better relations with other local </p><p>groups and more moderate statements and behavior.  Turkey </p><p>believes the Iraqi Turkmen remain vulnerable.  The ITF, he </p><p>said, is opening 30 offices across Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 3. (S) The final issue raised at the meeting, according to </p><p>Uras, was the continuing PKK/KADEK presence in northern Iraq. </p><p> The Turks observed that the US had coordinated well with </p><p>Iran in "crushing" the MEK, and hoped we would do the same </p><p>with the PKK/KADEK.  Uras added that, in his view, we did not </p><p>need to "crush" the PKK/KADEK, but rather capture them so </p><p>they could serve short prison terms and be "rehabilitated." </p><p>Uras also said the US and Turkey should soon discuss how to </p><p>end the work of the Peace Monitoring Force (PMF).  In </p><p>general, Uras noted, Turkey has been soft on substance </p><p>regarding Iraq but has talked tough, while the Iranians and </p><p>Syrians have taken the opposite tact.  Turkey, he said, was </p><p>fed up with having Syria and Iran hide behind Turkey on these </p><p>issues.  He said Turkey would likely be less tough on </p><p>northern Iraq issues in the near future as it sought to shift </p><p>to a trade focus in relations with the Kurds there. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
