(U) The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs completed </p><p>the final draft of a proposal permitting the creation of </p><p>full-fledged labor unions, on 2/24.  The plan will be </p><p>reviewed by the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of </p><p>Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf before a final proposal </p><p>is submitted to the Cabinet. After approval by the Cabinet, </p><p>the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs will enact a bylaw </p><p>to institute the new policy.  The Ministry will also </p><p>establish a new department responsible for handling matters </p><p>related to labor unions. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Under the draft proposal, the Labour Ministry will </p><p>establish membership conditions for new unions.  A worker is </p><p>defined as a "person who works in a public or private </p><p>organization and gets paid for his work."  Groups of twenty </p><p>or more nationals working in a profession or trade will be </p><p>permitted to organize to protect their rights and interests. </p><p>Organizations will be allowed to join Arab or international </p><p>trade unions and the proposal also refers to the possibility </p><p>of establishing a unified labor federation in the UAE. </p><p>Expatriate laborers working in the UAE for more than six </p><p>years will be allowed to join as associate members but will </p><p>not be permitted to vote or contest elections. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: The draft proposal by the Labour Ministry </p><p>is another step in the right direction by the UAEG to bring </p><p>domestic labor laws into conformity with international </p><p>standards.  While workers here continue to have considerable </p><p>rights of association -- and there have even been strikes </p><p>(often by expatriates over non-payment of wages) -- these </p><p>new proposals will officially ensure workers\' rights to </p><p>organize and bargain collectively. The Embassy will follow- </p><p>up with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs on the </p><p>draft proposal and monitor its movement through the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
