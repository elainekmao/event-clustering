(C) SUMMARY: The Oputa Panel held its final session on </p><p>October 19, and has begun to draft its findings, due by </p><p>year\'s end.  While Panel proceedings kept Nigerians glued to </p><p>their televisions, many came away feeling the Panel did not </p><p>delve far enough into the death of Abiola.  Nor was the Panel </p><p>able to force former Heads-of-State Buhari, Babangida and </p><p>Abubakar to appear and answer questions (the three snubbed a </p><p>special Panel offer to make in camera statements without </p><p>cross-examination). Beyond a few instances of personal and </p><p>inter-communal reconciliation and catharsis, the Panel\'s </p><p>greatest contribution was to provide a national forum for the </p><p>airing of human rights grievances, a first for Nigeria. </p><p>Despite its failings, this often emotional reminder of the </p><p>hardships suffered during military rule and the civil war was </p><p>a useful exercise, particularly when Nigeria has experienced </p><p>a degree of political tension and communal conflict that have </p><p>led some Nigerians to talk about the "order" provided by past </p><p>military governments.  A by-product of the Oputa Panel may </p><p>hav been to further boost the consolidation of Nigeria\'s </p><p>nascent and sometimes shaky democracy.  The Panel may seek </p><p>funding from the USG in order to complete its report.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION? </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The National Human Rights Violations Investigation </p><p>Commission (HRVIC), known as the Oputa Panel, finished its </p><p>public hearings in Abuja on October 19 (hearings were </p><p>previously held in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kano).  Highly </p><p>respected former Supreme Court Justice Chukwudifu Oputa </p><p>chaired the Panel, which received over 10,000 petitions and </p><p>memoranda alleging human rights violations by military </p><p>regimes from 1966 to 1998.  To manage this vast workload, 150 </p><p>cases were ultimately selected for public presentation based </p><p>on popular demand, different patterns of violations, the </p><p>evidence supporting the allegations and the possibility of </p><p>alternative redress for the violations.  The public hearings </p><p>also included special institutional and sectoral hearings on </p><p>civil society, the military and the security agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>A PANEL MEMBER SPEAKS </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During an October 10 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Panel member Father Matthew Hassan Kukah optimistically </p><p>described the Panel\'s outcome.  Kukah outlined the goals of </p><p>the Panel as: (1) reconciliation between individuals; (2) </p><p>reconciliation between communities; and, (3) national </p><p>reconciliation.  Considering its limited budget, the Panel </p><p>had provided a cathartic event for Nigeria, Kukah opined. </p><p>Reconciliation had occurred between some individuals and some </p><p>communities, and the country had been given a peek under the </p><p>veil of history to see the depredations inherent in military </p><p>regimes.  Not every stone had been turned, but enough muck </p><p>had been exposed to remind people of the dangers and excesses </p><p>of military rule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kukah noted that almost all of Nigeria\'s ethnic </p><p>communities had complained of "marginalization," through </p><p>denial of full access to resources, limited or no services </p><p>provided by government, or repression by another ethnic </p><p>group.  Kukah, mindful of the irony, noted many complainants </p><p>were themselves the subject of petitions by other communities </p><p>on the same grounds.  The Igbos had accused the Hausa-Fulani </p><p>of resource strangulation; in turn, the Ibibios accused the </p><p>Igbos of the same offense.  (COMMENT: Calls for a Sovereign </p><p>National Conference to review the 1999 Constitution, thus far </p><p>rejected by President Obasanjo, reflect the strong belief </p><p>that the current governmental framework will only promote </p><p>marginalization.  Only a fundamental change in the national </p><p>"rules of the game" (i.e., derivation of power and resources </p><p>to regionally-based ethnic groups) will protect the </p><p>fundamental rights of the groups advocating the conference. </p><p>However, there is no guarantee that such a conference will </p><p>foster reconciliation; instead, it might degrade into </p><p>inter-ethnic caviling and separatist polemics. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In his closing remarks on the last day of the Panel\'s </p><p>sitting, Justice Oputa commented in a similar vein, saying, </p><p>"from the memoranda and evidence from those groups, it became </p><p>apparent that there exists a simmering discontent which </p><p>should not ever be allowed to boil over.  The challenge then </p><p>is to find an answer to this dreadful trend called </p><p>marginalization; and find an answer Nigeria must." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>WHERE\'S THE BEEF? </p><p>================= </p><p>6. (C) The largest single complaint against the HRVIC was the </p><p>lack of closure regarding M.K.O. Abiola\'s death.  Numerous </p><p>claims came from numerous quarters, including a distasteful </p><p>insinuation that Dr. Susan Rice was involved because she </p><p>served the tea at the meeting where Abiola became ill. </p><p>Despite the time expended, the Panel was unable to make </p><p>conclusive findings that would satisfy rank-and-file </p><p>Nigerians regarding Abiola\'s demise.  Kukah described the </p><p>testimony surrounding Abiola\'s death as inconclusive and </p><p>dismissed accusations against Rice as "sensationalistic." </p><p>(COMMENT:  Some newspapers tried to give the insinuations </p><p>against Dr. Rice high media play, due to the obvious </p><p>sensational value of the by-line.  Fortunately, this </p><p>non-story never gained traction and has faded away.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Coming in a close second as the other major public </p><p>disappointment was that, after much wrangling, Generals </p><p>Abubakar, Babangida, and Buhari never appeared.  There was </p><p>considerable debate whether the three military Heads-of-State </p><p>who ruled Nigeria between 1983-1999 would appear before the </p><p>Panel and address allegations.  On October 3, the HRVIC </p><p>denied a claim of immunity argued by lawyers representing </p><p>Generals Abubakar, Babangida and Buhari, and suggested that </p><p>it could compel their attendance before the Commission.  By </p><p>the end of the hearings, however, the three had not appeared </p><p>and the Panel never sought to compel their presence.  (A </p><p>Court of Appeal subsequently ruled that they could not be </p><p>forced to appear, but this appellate decision was largely </p><p>moot, as it came after the Panel\'s final day of hearings.) </p><p>(See additional background in paras 11-14.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Kukah told the Ambassador that he had personally </p><p>spoken to all three, urging them to appear.  They had been </p><p>promised examinations of limited scope -- no issues outside </p><p>the four filed petitions would be allowed.  Moreover, Kukah </p><p>had informed them that the objective was not to assess </p><p>culpability, but to seek socially responsible national </p><p>reconciliation.  Kukah told the trio that after President </p><p>Obasanjo appeared twice before the Panel they were exposing </p><p>themselves to charges that they were contemptuous or afraid </p><p>because they really had something to hide.  Despite Kukah\'s </p><p>urgings, the three Generals never showed.  Kukah remarked </p><p>that the three were probably seen as the "last (viable </p><p>leaders) the North has to offer," and opined that those </p><p>surrounding the Generals might have urged them not to appear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>COMMENT - THE SUM IN A ZERO SUM GAME </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: The Panel\'s report, due at the end of the </p><p>year, is expected to focus on steps the Federal Government </p><p>should take to reduce the likelihood of future human rights </p><p>violations.  Many human rights problems in Nigeria are the </p><p>result of institutional weaknesses, i.e. a lack of human </p><p>rights training for the police, the use of an untrained </p><p>military for internal security, lack of resources for the </p><p>prison system, and a crippled judiciary.  Fundamentally, the </p><p>severe economic inequalities between the rich political and </p><p>economic elite and the poor majority highlight a major </p><p>cleavage, and ethnic and religious divisions continue to fuel </p><p>the perception among nearly every group that they are being </p><p>wronged by another group.  While the Panel managed to forge </p><p>limited personal and inter-communal reconciliation, it also </p><p>underscored that the larger questions, which gave rise to </p><p>past abuses, remain no closer to resolution now than before </p><p>the Panel convened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT CONT: The Panel did, however, allow the </p><p>"common man" to see in an unflattering glare some of the </p><p>major figures of Nigeria\'s military regimes.  This was useful </p><p>to remind Nigerians how problematic, ruthless and fractious </p><p>military rule was for the country.  This was particularly </p><p>helpful at a time when civilian leadership is faced with </p><p>numerous challenges.  The Oputa proceedings reminded many </p><p>Nigerians that the past does not offer solution; therefore, </p><p>the Panel may have provided a boost to greater consolidation </p><p>of Nigeria\'s nascent and unsteady democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONT: An opportunity to differentiate himself </p><p>from the Generals may partially explain why President </p><p>Obasanjo appeared before the Panel.  Many of his supporters, </p><p>and perhaps Obasanjo himself, believe the Generals, </p><p>particularly Babangida, are even now instigating political </p><p>problems, including fomenting unrest in the North.  Obasanjo </p><p>does not want a direct confrontation with these still </p><p>powerful king-makers.  However, he might like to see them </p><p>slog through a bit of mud.  By appearing at the Panel, </p><p>Obasanjo implicitly laid down the gauntlet to face public </p><p>scrutiny, or fail to appear and face public approbation. </p><p>Additionally, Obasanjo\'s appearance totally undermined any </p><p>claims of indemnity the three Generals might have asserted as </p><p>former Heads-of-State, since Obasanjo appeared as a sitting </p><p>President.  However, it would have been confrontational to </p><p>force the Generals\' appearance.  Both Justice Oputa and </p><p>Obasanjo are southerners, and a confrontation with the three </p><p>northern Generals might have taken on regional and even </p><p>religious connotations.  Instead of reducing discord, the </p><p>Panel could have added to it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Initially created by President Obasanjo in June 1999, </p><p>the Oputa Panel was constituted under the Tribunals of </p><p>Inquiry Act to investigate human rights violations committed </p><p>by military regimes ruling Nigeria from December 31, 1983 to </p><p>May 29, 1999.  In September 1999, the Panel was re-designated </p><p>as a Judicial Commission, giving it powers to compel </p><p>appearance and issue orders equivalent to those of a High </p><p>Court.  With this amendment, the Commission became known as </p><p>the Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission (HRVIC), </p><p>or more commonly, "The Oputa Panel."  The scope of the Panel </p><p>was also adjusted to include all military regimes since </p><p>January 1966, and the duration of its mandate was extended to </p><p>one year from the date of its first public sitting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Public hearings began October 23, 2000 in Abuja. </p><p>Since then, hearings have been held in Lagos, Port Harcourt, </p><p>Kano, Enugu and again in Abuja.  The Commission listed for </p><p>public presentation and evidence 150 of over 10,000 petitions </p><p>and memoranda submitted by members of the public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The Commission has requested a six-month extension of </p><p>its current mandate to draft and submit its report, findings </p><p>and recommendations.  The HRVIC expects to complete this work </p><p>by the end of 2001.  A preliminary concept of its report </p><p>proposes a document in seven volumes, with an executive </p><p>summary constituting an eighth volume.  The volumes will </p><p>cover: the background, evolution and mandate of the </p><p>Commission; the nature and typologies of human rights </p><p>violations under the military; the summary of the proceedings </p><p>of and petitions submitted to the Commission (2 volumes); the </p><p>legal and international context to the work of the </p><p>Commission; reparations and remedies; findings and </p><p>recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Specialists in international and human rights law </p><p>will write the report working under the supervision of the </p><p>Commission.  The Commission is not fully funded for the </p><p>drafting and publication phase.  The Federal Government plans </p><p>to release funds to assist the Commission.  However, </p><p>additional funding will likely be required.  The Commission </p><p>has begun to seek such assistance, but has not yet approached </p><p>the USG. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
