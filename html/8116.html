<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000907 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POSSIBLE DEAL FOR WARRI POLITICAL IMPASSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 816 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Post\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) </p><p>met with Temi Harriman, the National Assembly </p><p>Representative (PDP) for the Warri area, on May 13 </p><p>in Abuja.  Although she characterized polling in her </p><p>constituency on both April 12 and 19 (National </p><p>Assembly and Presidential/Gubernatorial elections, </p><p>respectively) as almost non-existent, she refrained </p><p>from casting doubt on her renewed electoral mandate. </p><p>She felt she was a strong candidate for Deputy </p><p>Speaker of the House, a position to be decided at a </p><p>May 22 PDP meeting in Port Harcourt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Commenting on the ongoing crisis in the Warri </p><p>area, Harriman, an Itsekiri, blamed  the new </p><p>outbreak of violence on Ijaw youth in the Warri </p><p>Southwest Local Government Area (LGA).  She rejected </p><p>Ijaw claims that this LGA is populated predominantly </p><p>by Ijaws.  Similarly, she dismissed Ijaw demands to </p><p>control the majority of the LGA\'s 10 electoral </p><p>wards, six of which are currently controlled by </p><p>Itsekiri.  Nevertheless, she emphasized that her </p><p>constituency, the three LGAs of Warri, include </p><p>substantial numbers of Ijaw and Uhrobos in addition </p><p>to her fellow Itsekiri; she claimed to be working </p><p>with moderate Ijaw leaders who in turn have given </p><p>her political support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) During the meeting at Harriman\'s Abuja </p><p>residence, Jefferson Arubi, the PDP candidate  for </p><p>the Chairman of the Warri Southwest local government </p><p>area, arrived with an "emergency" issue to discuss </p><p>with Harriman.  According to the visibly agitated </p><p>Arubi, the Delta PDP had just reassigned him to run </p><p>for the lower office of Deputy Chairman, while </p><p>elevating an Ijaw candidate to the Chairmanship </p><p>candidacy.  Arubi claimed this was the handiwork of </p><p>Delta  Governor James Ibori (PDP); Arubi said he had </p><p>been told that any attempt to resist this change </p><p>would lead to his expulsion from the party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Harriman\'s immediate response was negative, </p><p>because Warri Southwest LGA had been historically </p><p>controlled by Itsekiri.  Upon reflection, however, </p><p>she noted that this was likely an attempt by the </p><p>Presidency to ameliorate the Warri crisis by giving </p><p>the Ijaw a taste of politcal power in Warri.  She </p><p>advised Arubi to accept the Deputy Chairman position </p><p>and inform the Ijaw candidate that the Itsekiri have </p><p>accepted this move in the name of peace.  The Ijaw </p><p>should not, however, consider the arrangement </p><p>permanent; in four years the Chairmanship should </p><p>revert to Itsekiri control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Comment:  The militant Ijaw youth of Warri </p><p>have vowed to block the June 21 LGA elections. </p><p>Ijaws fear the Itsekiri will dominate the elections. </p><p>The effort to give the Chairmanship of the LGA to </p><p>the Ijaw certainly looks like an attempt to help </p><p>defuse the crisis.  While this solution is a stop- </p><p>gap measure and does not address the fundamental </p><p>Ijaw grievances of the Warri Southwest LGA, it </p><p>offers the Ijaw tangible political concessions that </p><p>might help ease tensions.  This gesture by itself, </p><p>however, is probably inadequate to mollify the Ijaw </p><p>militants.  The challenge will now be for </p><p>traditional Ijaw leaders such as Chief E.K. Clark to </p><p>"sell" this development as a meaningful gain to the </p><p>rebellious, sometimes criminally inclined, Ijaw </p><p>youth in the marshy areas of Warri. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
