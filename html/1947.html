(U) SUMMARY: Riots broke out in central Jos afternoon of </p><p>September 7.  Deputy Governor Botmang imposed an 1800 to 0600 </p><p>curfew, made a statewide broadcast calling for calm, and </p><p>authorized the police to shoot looters and trouble-makers on </p><p>sight.  Botmang received permission from President Obasanjo </p><p>to call out the Army to back the police.  By nightfall, </p><p>Police sources were reporting that the incident was </p><p>contained.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) PolOff 7 September (1800 local) received a call from </p><p>Terry Hammack, a missionary with the Society of International </p><p>Missionaries in Jos, Plateau State.  According to Hammack, </p><p>riots began during the afternoon in the Nassarawa district </p><p>and the area near the Jos Central Mosque.  He did not know </p><p>the immediate cause but speculated that rumors of people </p><p>putting "curses" on others may have created tensions. </p><p>Reportedly, a man putting "curses" on people was caught by a </p><p>crowd on 6 September, and stated that he was "hired by </p><p>Alhajis" (Muslims) to curse people.  Hammack commented that </p><p>local politics might have also played a role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The caller stated that he had traveled just outside of </p><p>the riot area on his motorcycle, seen fires and heard rumors </p><p>that some churches had been burned.  He noted that most of </p><p>the car dealerships lots had been emptied quickly during the </p><p>afternoon and taxis were off the roads -- people were walking </p><p>to their homes.  In the Government Reserved Area (GRA) where </p><p>the caller lives, he stated that "you wouldn\'t know it was </p><p>going on."  Further, he believed the roads out of Jos to the </p><p>north and south were still open.  He said he had seen </p><p>military vehicles and heard sirens heading into the city. </p><p>Embassy cannot confirm that any religious structures were </p><p>burned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) CDA Andrews spoke at 1725 GMT with Plateau State </p><p>Deputy Governor Chief Michael Botmang (Governor Dariye is on </p><p>leave).  Botmang stated that the riot had started on Bauchi </p><p>Road and spread.  Some people had been beaten by crowds and </p><p>some houses had been burned.  Botmang had made a broadcast </p><p>asking people to remain calm.  He told the CDA that he had </p><p>authorized the police to shoot looters and other </p><p>trouble-makers on sight.  Moreover, he had asked President </p><p>Obasanjo to authorize the use of the Army to back the police, </p><p>and had received permission.  The General Officer Commanding, </p><p>3rd Armored Division was responding.  Botmang had also </p><p>imposed an 1800 to 0600 curfew, and said he would travel in </p><p>the city on 8 September to view the situation and gather more </p><p>details.  He assured CDA that the rioting would be contained </p><p>and that American lives and property would be safely guarded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) RSO spoke with Olayinka Balogun, Personal Staff </p><p>Officer to the Inspector General of Police.  Balogun stated </p><p>that he had spoken to the Commissioner of Police of Plateau </p><p>State, M.D. Abubakar.  According to Abubakar\'s report, </p><p>rioting had started during Friday prayers at the Central </p><p>Mosque.  The Mosque was filled beyond capacity with </p><p>worshippers, so some worshippers carried their prayer rugs </p><p>into the street to pray.  One motorist, unhappy with the </p><p>detour, returned to the scene with several other individuals, </p><p>and a conflict ensued.  Balogun stated that the problems were </p><p>isolated (to the Mosque area), and that the Police had the </p><p>situation under control. (COMMENT: Balogun was unspecific </p><p>when asked what "under control" meant.  END COMMENT). </p><p>Embassy was unable to contact Commissioner M.D. Abubakar </p><p>directly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Duty Officer spoke with Charles Abe, Manager at the </p><p>Hilltop Hotel in Jos at 1830 GMT.  Abe said there was a lot </p><p>of confusion, but that the police were trying to get the </p><p>situation under control.  He reported that no Americans were </p><p>staying at the Hilltop.  At 1835 GMT, Duty Officer spoke with </p><p>the Duty Manager at the Hill Station Hotel, Fomm Yakub. </p><p>Yakub said there were police guarding the Hill Station Hotel, </p><p>and the uprising had not reached his location. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) An official American couple that was planning to </p><p>travel to Jos on September 8 has been advised to defer the </p><p>trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Post intends to activate the warden system and deliver </p><p>the following message: "The Embassy has received reports of </p><p>disturbances in Jos, and we understand a curfew has been </p><p>declared by the Deputy Governor of Plateau State between 1800 </p><p>and 0600.  All American citizens are urged to exercise </p><p>caution until the situation has been resolved." </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
