<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, CASC, YM, EAC </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1Z01:  SANAA EAC MEETING MARCH 30 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) meeting on March 30 to assess Embassy </p><p>security posture and threat information.  Key offices and </p><p>personnel represented at the meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, </p><p>CONS, DCM, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  ORCA and RSO reported no new threats.  DCM </p><p>briefed on authorized departure procedures. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  EAC decided to go to a "MoveSafe Lite" posture </p><p>effective close of business March 30.  EAC decided to change </p><p>its security posture from MoveSafe to more normal operations </p><p>in the absence of new threat information and given the lack </p><p>of large violent demonstrations in the last several days. </p><p>EAC members deemed it essential to adopt a flexible approach </p><p>-- adjusting security measures in response to changing threat </p><p>conditions -- in order to sustain full compliance of </p><p>employees with security conditions throughout the war in </p><p>Iraq, no matter how long it lasts.  Employees are encouraged </p><p>to continue using the armored shuttles, but are allowed to </p><p>drive their own vehicles if they wish to and from work. </p><p>Travel outside of Embassy and residence will remain at the </p><p>discretion of the COM and RSO and be severely limited. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Consular services will be provided on a limited </p><p>basis during a gradual return to a pre-StandFast level of </p><p>operations.  Immigrant visa applications and American </p><p>passport services will be provided on an appointment-only </p><p>basis. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
