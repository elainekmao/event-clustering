JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is a corrected version of KUWAIT 5292, adding </p><p>dropped text.  Please disregard KUWAIT 5292 in favor of this </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Action Request:  see paragraph 8. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SUMMARY:  ICRC seeks advance approval of draft </p><p>Minutes of the upcoming TPC meeting (date still TBD).  We </p><p>seek Department\'s concurrence with recommended wording, and </p><p>guidance on pressing the Speicher case.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Draft Minutes:  ICRC has circulated to the coalition </p><p>allies (US, UK, France, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) draft Minutes </p><p>of the upcoming extraordinary meeting of the Tripartite </p><p>Commission (TPC - see reftel).  Its intent is to ensure that </p><p>there are no surprises in Geneva, by getting all parties to </p><p>agree in advance on the outcome of the meeting, and by </p><p>strictly limiting the agenda (for instance, prepared </p><p>statements are not/not anticipated).  As soon as the allies </p><p>agree, ICRC will share the draft with Iraq.  The draft text </p><p>is as follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT </p><p>Minutes of the 24th Tripartite Commission Meeting </p><p>Geneva, xy December 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Tripartite Commission met on xy December 2002.  It </p><p>was attended by all its members. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Tripartite Commission agreed to extend the mandate of </p><p>the Technical Sub-Committee until the next meeting of the </p><p>Tripartite Commission. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Tripartite Commission formally endorsed the following: </p><p> </p><p>To suspend the Technical Sub-Committee\'s quorum rule No 8 for </p><p>a period of four (4) months as permitted by rule No 16 in </p><p>order to allow meetings between Iraq and any other Tripartite </p><p>Commission member to address cases previously discussed in </p><p>the Tripartite Commission in the presence of a third </p><p>Tripartite Commission member mutually agreed between Iraq and </p><p>the other party. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Tripartite Commission decided to hold its next </p><p>meeting in Geneva on xy April, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Republic of France               Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </p><p> </p><p>Republic of Iraq                 United Kingdom of Great </p><p>Britain and Northern Ireland </p><p> </p><p>State of Kuwait                  United States of America </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Kuwaiti Addition:  Kuwait wants to insert a fifth </p><p>point stipulating that the countries that would meet under </p><p>the new TSC dispensation would be Kuwait and Iraq, in the </p><p>presence of Saudi Arabia.  Dr. Ibrahim al-Shaheen, Vice </p><p>Chairman of the National Committee for Missing and POW </p><p>Affairs (NCMPA), told the Ambassador December 9 that the GOK </p><p>is concerned that not specifying an agreed formulation for </p><p>the TSC during the TPC would throw the question into a round </p><p>of time-consuming bilateral discussions which Iraq would no </p><p>doubt seek to exploit for its benefit.  In addition, putting </p><p>this in the TPC Minutes would make it doubly clear that the </p><p>Iraq-Kuwait-Saudi meetings came under the TPC umbrella.  From </p><p>our perspective, however, if not worded carefully, the </p><p>Kuwaiti formulation might inadvertently preclude other </p><p>possible compositions of the TSC, such as US and Iraq in the </p><p>presence of Kuwait (or any other third TPC member acceptable </p><p>to Iraq).  We have informed ICRC ad referendum that we can </p><p>live with the fifth point provided it is worded as follows: </p><p>"The initial meetings of the Technical Sub-Committee will be </p><p>limited to Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia."  The key word </p><p>there is "initial," which preserves our equities. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Background and Comment:  The TPC, including its TSC, </p><p>constitutes the internationally-recognized apolitical forum </p><p>for direct discussion among the parties to the Gulf War of </p><p>issues related to POWs and missing persons.  UNSCR 1284 </p><p>specifically called on Iraq to resume cooperation with the </p><p>TPC.  Iraq has boycotted the Commission for the last four </p><p>years, allegedly in protest at US and UK participation. </p><p>However, recently it has tried to tempt both Kuwait and the </p><p>US into addressing such issues bilaterally, i.e. outside the </p><p>TPC framework.  Last spring, the Iraqis issued a patently </p><p>cynical invitation to the USG to come to Baghdad to discuss </p><p>the case of missing US Naval aviator Captain Michael Scott </p><p>Speicher.  The USG did not take the bait.  Now, it appears </p><p>that Iraq may be willing to re-engage - at least with some </p><p>TPC members - within the TPC framework.  That was the intent </p><p>of the proposed rule suspension.  Given Iraq\'s past </p><p>pronouncements, all expectations are that it will agree only </p><p>to meet with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, but the wording of the </p><p>proposed rule suspension was intentionally designed to leave </p><p>open the possibility of other TSC permutations, including a </p><p>US-Iraq-third country meeting on the Speicher case.  At the </p><p>upcoming extraordinary meeting of the TPC, the US delegation </p><p>may want to propose such a session.  If so, it will need to </p><p>be prepared for the unlikely event that Iraq might suddenly </p><p>profess readiness to engage in-depth on Speicher on the spot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Dates: </p><p> </p><p>A. PolChief asked ICRC Regional Delegate Michel Meyer why, </p><p>according to the draft Minutes, the TPC meeting set for March </p><p>6-7 was being put off to April.  Meyer explained that April </p><p>would allow a full four months to test the success of the </p><p>rule suspension, but he took the points that: </p><p> </p><p>(i) it is not necessary for the TPC to wait the full four </p><p>months before deciding whether to extend the rule suspension, </p><p>and </p><p> </p><p>(ii) if the next TPC meeting is not until April, it should be </p><p>earlier in the month, i.e. not quite four months from the </p><p>date of the rule suspension, to keep the suspension from </p><p>lapsing. </p><p> </p><p>B.  ICRC has still not proposed a specific date for the </p><p>upcoming extraordinary meeting, but we expect it to be in the </p><p>December 14-20 timeframe.  We will advise USMission Geneva </p><p>immediately when we know the date, in order to secure hotel </p><p>accommodations.  Regarding the spring 2003 TPC meeting, we </p><p>recommend holding onto the reservations made for March 6-7; </p><p>we will advise as soon as any new dates for that meeting are </p><p>confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED:  Department, in consultation with </p><p>OSD/DPMO, is requested to advise as soon as possible (a) </p><p>whether the draft Minutes as per paragraphs 4 and 5 above are </p><p>acceptable to the USG; (b) whether we should push in Geneva </p><p>for a meeting with the Iraqis in the revised TSC context, and </p><p>how hard (also, should we flag this now in our comments on </p><p>the draft Minutes?); (c) if the Iraqis refuse to meet with </p><p>us, whether we should object to the proposed rule change; (d) </p><p>if the Iraqis are amenable and leave the choice to us, which </p><p>if any country we would prefer as the third party.  We would </p><p>be most grateful for an answer to (a) by our oob Tuesday </p><p>December 10, as ICRC is keen to finalize the draft Minutes </p><p>and present them to Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
