THE </p><p>   EDITORIALS WERE UNANIMOUS IN CALLING ON PRESIDENT </p><p>   ROBERT MUGABE TO ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES </p><p>   FACING THE COUNTRY.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "BEYOND THE VOTE" THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>   WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" (03/14) COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>   "THAT ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD NOT BE </p><p>   FREE AND FAIR WAS NOT IN DOUBT FROM THE VERY START. </p><p>   . .  THE UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD, MARKED BY THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT\'S ABUSE OF THE STATE MEDIA, ITS USE OF </p><p>   HASTILY CRAFTED UNDEMOCRATIC LAWS WHICH WERE </p><p>   CHANGED VIRTUALLY EVERY HOUR TO SUIT ONE CANDIDATE, </p><p>   ITS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT INDEPENDENT MONITORS AND </p><p>   OBSERVERS AND ITS DECISION TO CUT POLLING STATIONS </p><p>   IN URBAN AREAS, WAS BOUND TO PRODUCE A PRE- </p><p>   DETERMINED RESULT. . .  ZIMBABWEANS WHO VOTED IN </p><p>   THEIR MILLIONS TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THEIR </p><p>   HARROWING LIVES AND TO RESCUE THEIR COUNTRY FROM </p><p>   ITS RAPID DESCENT INTO THE ABYSS WERE BOUND TO BE </p><p>   DISAPPOINTED AND ANGERED, BUT THAT IS NOW WATER </p><p>   UNDER THE BRIDGE.  THEY WILL FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. </p><p>   UNFORTUNATELY FOR ZIMBABWEANS, THE POLL RESULT </p><p>   SPELLS MUCH MORE PAIN AND SUFFERING BECAUSE, FROM </p><p>   NOW ON, THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL </p><p>   TREAT THIS COUNTRY AS A PARIAH WHICH IT IS. . . </p><p>   FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS BACKERS, THIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00672  01 OF 03  141108Z </p><p>   ELECTION WILL BE INTERPRETED AS A FINAL AND HEROIC </p><p>   VINDICATION OF HIS BLACK NATIONALIST CREDENTIALS </p><p>   AND HARD-LINE STANCE ON THE UNRESOLVED LAND </p><p>   QUESTION WHICH HE SAYS HE MUST PUT TO REST ONCE AND </p><p>   FOR ALL.  MANY IN THE LAND AND BEYOND WILL BE </p><p>   SEARCHING FOR CLUES TO SEE IF, IN HIS LAST </p><p>   PRESIDENCY IF IT STANDS, HE WILL REDEEM HIMSELF AND </p><p>   PULL HIS TROUBLED COUNTRY BACK FROM THE BRINK. </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .MUGABE MUST NOW BEGIN TO CHART A NEW AND </p><p>   DIFFERENT VISION FOR ZIMBABWE COMPARED TO THE ONE </p><p>   HE RAMMED THROUGH THE NATION FOR TWO DECADES, NO </p><p>   MATTER HOW LATE.  HE MUST WORK ASSIDUOUSLY TO HEAL </p><p>   A NATION DEEPLY FRACTURED BY BLOODY CONFLICT, </p><p>   UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC RUIN AND MASS HUNGER IN ONE </p><p>   OF AFRICA\'S RICHEST COUNTRIES.

PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS WON A </p><p>   NEW MANDATE.  HIS WIN WAS COMFORTABLE AND DECISIVE. </p><p>   HOWEVER, AS HE PREPARES FOR A NEW SIX-YEAR TERM OF </p><p>   OFFICE, HE DOES SO AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A HIGHLY </p><p>   POLARIZED NATION.  FOR TWO YEARS ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN </p><p>   IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT </p><p>   RESEMBLED A BATTLEFIELD OR A CIVIL CONFLICT. </p><p>   HAVING OVERCOME THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF HIS </p><p>   POLITICAL CAREER, THE PRESIDENT FACES THE DAUNTING </p><p>   TASK OF BRINGING TOGETHER A DIVIDED NATION THAT HAS </p><p>   FOR YEARS EXISTED UNDER A FACADE OF RACIAL HARMONY </p><p>   AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY WHILE HIDING THE DEEP </p><p>   DIVISIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK COUNTRYMEN AND </p><p>   THE GROWING POVERTY AMONG ITS PEASANTRY. . .

FOR AS LONG AS THE MDC </p><p>   LEADER, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, CONTINUES TO ASSUME THE </p><p>   POSTURE OF A GUERILLA LEADER AND NOT AN OPPOSITION </p><p>   LEADER, THE OUTSIDE FORCES THAT HAVE SUBJECTED THIS </p><p>   COUNTRY TO THE MOST TORRID TIMES WILL HAVE AN </p><p>   EXCUSE TO PERPETUATE THEIR NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES. </p><p>   THE FIGHTING IS OVER AND IT IS TIME TO REBUILD THE </p><p>   COUNTRY LOOKING AT THE REALITIES THAT CONFRONT THIS </p><p>   NATION.  WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BURY OUR HEADS IN THE </p><p>   SAND AND PRETEND THAT THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>   ISSUES THAT ARE CRYING OUT TO BE REDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00672  02 OF 03  141108Z </p><p>   "THE QUESTION OF LAND WAS THE MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE </p><p>   IN THIS ELECTION, WHICH WAS AFFIRMED BY THE </p><p>   MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>   MUGABE. . .
