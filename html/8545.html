(C) Summary: Chief of the General Staff (TGS) Ozkok\'s </p><p>attempt to smother disgruntlement in senior ranks and at the </p><p>same time to warn ruling AK party against perceived </p><p>anti-secular trends has achieved neither goal.  While </p><p>tensions between the military and AK, and within each, will </p><p>continue, we see no likelihood under the current </p><p>constellation of forces for the military to force a change of </p><p>government.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Chief of the TGS Ozkok\'s May 26 political warning in </p><p>the form of a briefing for selected newspaper journalists is </p><p>yet more evidence that the TGS is very unhappy: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Unhappy within itself (Ozkok is being pressed by a group </p><p>of six to eight senior officers who hold what a broad range </p><p>of journalist, political, and national security analyst </p><p>contacts characterize for us as "Eurasianist, status quo, </p><p>keep-military-procurement-secret" views; other TGS officers, </p><p>such as J-5 chief of agreements Air Force MG Ajar, who is </p><p>well connected to Ozkok, told us he agrees with the </p><p>assessment that Ozkok is too soft on AK). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Unhappy with the AK government, which proclaims itself </p><p>conservative-democratic, but which the TGS and most of the </p><p>rest of the Kemalist Establishment (presidency, most of the </p><p>judiciary, bureaucracy, main opposition CHP, and large </p><p>majorities of the media and academe) charge is both </p><p>incompetent and carrying an Islamist torch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Unhappy with the fact, flexibility, and speed of change in </p><p>the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Unhappy with change at home, where social change from </p><p>below, a growing freedom of debate about many hitherto taboo </p><p>subjects, and the government\'s attempt to avoid submitting </p><p>its newest package of EU Copenhagen Criteria-related reforms </p><p>to the military-dominated NSC for review all suggest that, as </p><p>ordinary Turks consider where their country should go, the </p><p>Turkish military is beginning to lose its position as the </p><p>ultimate arbiter of republican probity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) As many contacts -- among them premier national </p><p>defense analyst Faruk Demir -- have reminded us, we should </p><p>put Ozkok\'s latest remarks in the context of a longer series </p><p>of TGS statements and growing military discomfort (refs A-F </p><p>stretching back to October 2002).  Ozkok\'s aims on May 26 </p><p>were six-fold: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A) To cut the legs off the press reports, originating in the </p><p>May 23 issue of Kemalist "Cumhuriyet" that "young officers" </p><p>are very uneasy about AK party and the AK government\'s goals. </p><p> "Young officers" is a phrase redolent of the May 27, 1960 </p><p>coup, engineered by young officers against both the </p><p>government of the day and senior commanders, and Ozkok was </p><p>determined (1) to end public speculation that his tenure is </p><p>under question in the officers\' ranks and (2) to restore </p><p>discipline in the ranks -- his use of an oblique Ottomanesque </p><p>phrase ("kerameti kendinden menkul kimseler", roughly </p><p>equivalent to "Lord Muck miracle workers") to demean his TGS </p><p>critics made his message to them all the blunter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B) While acknowledging that the TGS is not monolithic in its </p><p>discussions of "ideas", to reject all speculation that there </p><p>are differences of view or any polarization in the TGS (note: </p><p>to protect his image as chief of the TGS, Ozkok felt he had </p><p>to assert that there is no difference of view in the TGS, but </p><p>others, including MG Acar, readily admit to us that there is </p><p>a heated debate, especially concerning Turkey\'s direction on </p><p>the EU, relations with the U.S., and what to do about AK </p><p>party). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) To declare that the TGS and AK government are not on the </p><p>same wavelength. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(D) To affirm that the TGS as a whole is "uneasy" with the </p><p>current political situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(E) To reject any discussion of a coup "under this roof" (the </p><p>TGS) but to leave the journalists, and thus the public at </p><p>large on alert (1) by emphasizing that the armed forces will </p><p>continue its secularist struggle "to the very end" within the </p><p>constitutional framework; and (2) by warning that the </p><p>February 28 process (the "post-modern" coup that brought an </p><p>end to the Islamist Erbakan government in 1997) is a cause </p><p>and effect relationship, and "with the reasons for February </p><p>28 continuing, its effects will continue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(F) To defend himself against the charges -- which appear to </p><p>originate with the high-ranking generals aligned against him </p><p>-- that he is too democratic and Western-oriented to be a </p><p>strong guardian of core "secularist" values; Ozkok said that </p><p>his attachment to democratic values and the benefits of </p><p>having served in Western billets strengthen his ability to </p><p>defend core values. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ozkok\'s briefing has produced sound and fury, but </p><p>uneven effect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) First, press and private commentaries have been as </p><p>openly critical of the military\'s heavy-handedness as we </p><p>recall ever having experienced in Turkey.  Not one of the </p><p>journalists, analysts, politicians or businessmen we have </p><p>talked to since the briefing sees a coup as possible under </p><p>current circumstances, or even desirable.  However, Demir </p><p>emphasized that the way Ozkok broached the coup subject </p><p>leaves the door open should the AK government\'s performance </p><p>cause widespread and sharp discontent, thereby eroding the </p><p>resilient support Erdogan and AK continue to have in </p><p>Anatolia.  Some see Ozkok\'s position as lessened or, more </p><p>broadly, the military\'s ability to intimidate politicians and </p><p>the public as diminished.  Emblematic of this latter view is </p><p>the comment we heard from a major crude oil and molasses </p><p>shipper, who expressed the hope that this controversy marks a </p><p>definitive turning point toward full democracy and civilian </p><p>control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Second, senior generals\' objections to Ozkok\'s more </p><p>patient, reasonable line appear not to have abated.  Our </p><p>defense and national security contacts identify seven of the </p><p>generals opposed to Ozkok as Land Forces Commander Yalman, </p><p>Jandarma Commander Eruygur, First Army Commander Dogan, </p><p>Aegean Army Commander Tolon, Second Army Commander Turkeri, </p><p>and NSC SecGen Kilinc, with Buyukanit described as playing it </p><p>both ways.  Buyukanit\'s anti-American/anti-Western remarks at </p><p>a May 29 conference in Istanbul (ref H) lend weight to </p><p>classifying him in this group.  Cengiz Candar noted to us May </p><p>29 a report that on May 28, General Dogan, in speaking at a </p><p>memorial service for a recently deceased army colleague, </p><p>deliberately used the inflammatory "young officers" phrase in </p><p>a way which would underscore continuing defiance of Ozkok. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The carrying power of this group remains a subject of </p><p>debate.  Three contacts (Faruk Demir, a military affairs </p><p>journalist, and a center-right politician with close ties to </p><p>high-level retired generals) have separately told us they </p><p>have heard that this group of generals aims to give Ozkok a </p><p>memorandum demanding that he resign or submit to their view </p><p>and get tough with AK.  At the same time, MG Acar told us he </p><p>sees no possibility of an "open rupture" within the military. </p><p> Moreover, Ozkok has the opportunity to put his own stamp on </p><p>the military this year.  He can retire two of this group (who </p><p>also opposed his nomination as CHOD) in summer 2003, and two </p><p>more in summer 2004.  He will promote a significant number of </p><p>three- and four-star generals and can change up to 80% of the </p><p>senior TGS staff this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Third, P.M. Erdogan has publicly admonished those who </p><p>would seek to foment AK-military tensions and privately </p><p>acknowledged that it is essential to support Ozkok, although </p><p>he told Cengiz Candar he is at a loss how to do so.  AK </p><p>deputy party chairman Firat affirmed to us May 30 that </p><p>Erdogan is searching for a modus vivendi.  At the same time, </p><p>Justice Minister Cicek; Firat; and other AK M.P.s such as </p><p>former Erdogan chief of staff Comez, deputy parliamentary </p><p>group chairmen Ipek and Ergin, and human rights committee </p><p>deputy chairman Torun, have each reiterated to us in the past </p><p>few days that the party will press ahead with its new EU </p><p>harmonization reform packages.  Ipek emphasized that the NSC </p><p>is merely an advisory body and the fiery Torun asserted that </p><p>the party is ready "to go down like Menderes" (the P.M. </p><p>removed in the 1960 coup and hanged in 1961) to defend its </p><p>reforms against the military.  However, most of our AK </p><p>interlocutors admit that they will have to slow the pace </p><p>owing to TGS and NSC objections to specific reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: Ozkok and Erdogan appear to be strange </p><p>bedfellows as each grapples with lack of coherence and </p><p>discipline in the ranks below and both try to figure out a </p><p>modus vivendi with the other through weekly one-on-one </p><p>meetings.  Each tries to give direction to the divided </p><p>institution (military high command, parliamentary majority) </p><p>he relies on for authority and power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Given Erdogan\'s political savvy and the strong </p><p>protection afforded him by his continuing solid support </p><p>across Turkey, we see no evidence that a coup, direct or </p><p>politically-engineered, is likely under current </p><p>circumstances.  However, aside from the pressures Ozkok </p><p>faces, his and Erdogan\'s challenge in finding a </p><p>mutually-compatible way forward is compounded by the </p><p>following factors in AK: Erdogan\'s self-imposed isolation and </p><p>consequent dearth of fresh information from outside; the </p><p>uneven level of competence among party vice chairmen and </p><p>parliamentary group deputy chairmen (whips); static-filled </p><p>communications between party and government on the one hand </p><p>and parliamentary group on the other; factions which render </p><p>the party a coalition in itself; controversy over whether the </p><p>party\'s candidates for management positions in the </p><p>bureaucracy are sufficiently competent or loyal to secular </p><p>precepts; and questions over the party\'s intentions in </p><p>pursuing certain draft legislation (e.g., right to set up a </p><p>prayer room -- of any denomination -- in every apartment </p><p>building).  See ref (F) and septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) What is clear is that Ozkok\'s briefing neither </p><p>satisfied those in the military who oppose his approach nor </p><p>intimidated AK.  The tensions between the military and AK, </p><p>and within each institution, will continue and affect </p><p>Turkey\'s ability to set itself on a consistent course in any </p><p>direction. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
