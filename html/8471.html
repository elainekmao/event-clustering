Dr. Mulhi agreed that instruments </p><p>to protect children were an important international effort. </p><p>He noted that Yemen\'s ratification of ILO Convention No. 182 </p><p>had resulted in the ROYG\'s strong cooperation with the ILO </p><p>and IPEC on specific programs to combat child labor despite </p><p>the widespread poverty in Yemen that causes it. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Mulhi asked for the protocols on children in armed </p><p>conflict and sale of children, child prostitution and child </p><p>pornography in Arabic to facilitate efforts in the ROYG to </p><p>sign and ratify.
