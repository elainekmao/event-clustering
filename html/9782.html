<p>UNCLAS MONTREAL 000999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN AND WHA/AND </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, SOCI, PREF, CA, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: YOUTH GROUP VISITS CONSULATE ON PLIGHT OF AFRO- </p><p>COLOMBIANS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Two leaders of Black Youth in Action (BYIA), a </p><p>Montreal NGO, paid a visit to the Consul General (CG) on </p><p>Monday, July 21.   The purpose of the visit was to deliver a </p><p>letter describing the displacement of the Afro-Colombian </p><p>population in Colombia and to request the names of African- </p><p>American civil rights leaders to whom BYIA could lobby for </p><p>the protection of the Afro-Colombians.  The CG provided a </p><p>suggested list of organizations to BYIA on July 25.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   BYIA, also known as Jeunesse Noire En Action (JNEA), </p><p>was founded in 1999.  It is a political and civic </p><p>organization composed of Black youth with family, </p><p>organizational and interest ties to Africa, the Caribbean, </p><p>North America and Latin America.  BYIA is "dedicated to </p><p>integrating Black youth in the social and political life of </p><p>Quebec Province and Canada."  The BYIA membership age range </p><p>is from 13 to 30.  The group has been successful recently in </p><p>getting its views heard around Montreal and other parts of </p><p>Quebec Province. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BYIA Founder and Political Coordinator Peter Flegel and </p><p>BYIA member Karl Didier informed the Consul General about </p><p>the organization\'s numerous initiatives in the past year. </p><p>The group expressed concern to Montreal Mayor Tremblay about </p><p>"racist" remarks made by Municipal Councillor Jeremy Searle </p><p>in a borough council meeting; launched a letter-writing </p><p>campaign to complain to the Editor-in-Chief of Quebec City\'s </p><p>major paper, Le Soleil, about a cartoon depiction of two </p><p>Black Francophones; launched a campaign in Montreal high </p><p>schools to combat violence; participated in the United </p><p>Nations Working Group on People of African Descent; engaged </p><p>municipal, provincial and federal government leaders about </p><p>the unemployment rate of Black university graduates; and </p><p>mobilized the Black youth vote in the 2003 provincial </p><p>election campaign.  As a result of its efforts in the 2003 </p><p>provincial campaign, BYIA has gained the attention of </p><p>Premier Jean Charest. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The primary purpose of the July 21 visit was to discuss </p><p>what BYIA reports as "ethnic cleansing" of the Afro- </p><p>Colombian population by the Colombian paramilitary forces. </p><p>The BYIA representatives specifically noted a May 2, 2002 </p><p>bombing that resulted in the death of 119 Afro-Colombians </p><p>and the serious injury of 98.  BYIA concluded that one of </p><p>the main causes for attacks on the Afro-Colombian community </p><p>is a link between the amended constitution that provided </p><p>Afro-Colombians with collective land ownership rights in </p><p>Choco Province and vested interests of Colombian and </p><p>multinational companies in the petroleum, uranium and gold </p><p>found in the area.  BYIA also noted that the Government of </p><p>Colombia seeks to build a canal linking the Caribbean Sea </p><p>with the Pacific Ocean through land owned by Afro- </p><p>Colombians. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BYIA reports that Colombian organizations have warned </p><p>that further attacks on the Afro-Colombian population are </p><p>imminent. BYIA said that it has voiced its concerns to the </p><p>Government of Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade (DFAIT), urging DFAIT to "pressure the </p><p>Government of Colombia to protect the Afro-Colombians from </p><p>paramilitary forces, to guarantee Afro-Colombian land </p><p>ownership after the civil war has ended, and to implement </p><p>social programs to assist the displaced Afro-Colombian </p><p>population."  BYIA also has urged the Government of Canada </p><p>to implement a moratorium on all deportations to Colombia. </p><p> </p><p>6. The two BYIA leaders closed their meeting with the CG by </p><p>requesting assistance in establishing contact with major </p><p>African American civil rights leaders, so that BYIA could </p><p>"inform them about the plight of Afro-Colombians and </p><p>encourage them to pressure the U.S. Government to protect </p><p>people of African descent in Colombia." </p><p> </p><p>7.  The CG faxed Political Coordinator Flegel on July 25, a </p><p>list and contact information for the following organizations </p><p>with human rights advocacy and/or interest in issues related </p><p>to the African diaspora: The National Association for the </p><p>Advancement of Colored People, The Congress of Racial </p><p>Equality, The King Center, The Rainbow Coalition/Operation </p><p>Push, The Carter Center and The Office of the Congressional </p><p>Black Caucus. </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
