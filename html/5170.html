<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01/17/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, SOCI, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Five things that upset Sinhalese </p><p>extremists </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 90, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>======= </p><p>1.  (C) Always a lively crowd, Sri Lanka\'s Sinhalese </p><p>extremists have been raising a ruckus over five issues </p><p>of late.  They have demanded, for example, that (#1) the </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador be expelled from the country, and </p><p>complained about (#2) a pro-Tamil movie that opened in </p><p>Europe recently and (#3) a BBC poll that gave pride of </p><p>place to a Tamil nationalist song.  Constructing </p><p>strawmen, they are also demanding that no effort be made </p><p>to change (#4) the flag or (#5) the national anthem as </p><p>part of the peace process.  Although their anti-peace </p><p>process tirades have generated little impact thus far, </p><p>the extremists\' use of these five issues highlights how </p><p>they continue to nibble away at the margins of the body </p><p>politic.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>Issue #1:  The Norwegian Ambassador </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In addition to their usual anti-peace process </p><p>tirades, Sri Lanka\'s Sinhalese extremists have been </p><p>raising a ruckus lately on five peace-related issues. </p><p>(Note:  FYI.  About 75 percent of Sri Lankans belong to </p><p>the Sinhalese ethnic group, which is mostly Buddhist. </p><p>Sinhalese extremist groups maintain the support of </p><p>somewhere over 10 percent of the total body politic.) </p><p>One of the issues that has them up in arms is Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Jon Westborg, who they want kicked out of the </p><p>country.  They charge that Westborg illegally allowed </p><p>the Norwegian Embassy to import radio equipment for the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in a diplomatic </p><p>consignment.  (Note:  In fact, the Norwegian Embassy did </p><p>this only at the specific request of the government\'s </p><p>Peace Secretariat.  This issue has prompted a recent </p><p>exchange of letters among the GSL, President </p><p>Kumaratunga, and the GoN -- see Reftels.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Upping the pressure in a January 13 press </p><p>statement, the Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party </p><p>demanded that Westborg leave the country immediately. </p><p>If this did not happen, it threatened to launch an </p><p>"agitation" campaign against him.  Commenting on the </p><p>situation, Taranjit Sandhu, polchief at the Indian High </p><p>Commission, told us that this was quite a "threat" </p><p>against Westborg, given the JVP\'s proven ability to </p><p>raise a crowd.  (Note:  The radical JVP, the country\'s </p><p>largest Sinhalese extremist party, has thousands of </p><p>disciplined cadre, including many from its lively labor </p><p>union wing.)  More generally, Sandhu thought that the </p><p>JVP\'s anti-Westborg invective was an attempt to ramp up </p><p>its long-standing campaign to undermine the Norwegian </p><p>government peace facilitation effort, which the JVP (and </p><p>other Sinhalese extremists) consider pro-LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>#2 & #3:  Anger over a Movie and a Song </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Another issue that has the extremists spun up </p><p>involves a movie called "In the Name of the Buddha," </p><p>which apparently opened in Oslo recently and is now </p><p>showing in the UK.  (Note:  The movie was reportedly </p><p>filmed mostly in the UK by Sri Lankan Tamils.)  From </p><p>what Mission understands (we have not seen it), the </p><p>movie takes a pro-Tamil slant on the Sri Lankan </p><p>conflict, accusing the GSL\'s security forces of </p><p>committing widespread human rights abuses.  In a </p><p>decidedly heavy-handed and inflammatory linkage, the </p><p>figure of the Buddha is reportedly super-imposed on a </p><p>Tamil cemetery at one point in the movie. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The showing of the movie in the UK has </p><p>garnered widespread negative publicity in Sri Lanka.  In </p><p>particular, it has enraged the JVP and the Sihala </p><p>Urumaya (SU), another extremist political party.  Both </p><p>parties have publicly demanded that the GSL work to </p><p>ensure that the movie is no longer shown.  In reaction </p><p>to the JVP and SU protests, as well as those of some </p><p>Buddhist groups which call the movie "blasphemous," Sri </p><p>Lankan High Commissioner in London Faiz Mustapha has </p><p>complained to the British Foreign Office and other HMG </p><p>ministries.  This effort has been to no avail inasmuch </p><p>as the movie is apparently still being shown. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Extremists are also angered over the results </p><p>of a recent poll on a BBC website.  The poll, which </p><p>asked people to register their favorite songs of all </p><p>time, listed the Tamil-language song "Poovum Nadakkuthu, </p><p>Pinchum Nadakkuthu" at the number five slot.  A rough </p><p>translation of the (rather prosaic) title is "Even the </p><p>children are displaced, the children are not spared." </p><p>The song is strongly pro-Tamil and anti-GSL, and recites </p><p>an account of Tamils being displaced due to an attack by </p><p>the Sri Lankan military.  Similar to the uproar against </p><p>"In the Name of the Buddha," the song has served to stir </p><p>up Sinhalese extremists, who have demanded that the song </p><p>be taken off the BBC website.  According to press </p><p>accounts, Mustapha was reportedly ordered by the Foreign </p><p>Minister to study the text of the song as the first step </p><p>before the possible launching of an official protest by </p><p>the GSL against it.  In response to the attention, the </p><p>BBC has stated that the poll was open to the public on </p><p>its website and it just published the results.  (Note: </p><p>The "top ten" list was extremely eclectic:  the number </p><p>one song is called "A Nation Once Again" by the Wolfe </p><p>Tones and the number eight song is "Believe" by Cher.) </p><p> </p><p>========================================== </p><p>#4 & #5:  The Flag and the National Anthem </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The JVP and SU have also criticized the </p><p>government heatedly for allegedly trying to change the </p><p>flag and national anthem.  Both parties accuse the GSL </p><p>of maintaining a "secret plan" to adjust the flag and </p><p>the anthem so that they represent a more cosmopolitan </p><p>nation and not primarily a Sinhalese Buddhist one. </p><p>(Note:  The Sri Lankan flag is dominated by a lion, </p><p>which is a symbol of Sinhalese Buddhists.  The national </p><p>anthem is also rich in Sinhalese Buddhist associations.) </p><p>In a letter to the Minister of Cultural Affairs, the SU </p><p>also accused the GSL of trying to re-do the anthem to </p><p>"suit the so-called proposed federal state."  (Note:  In </p><p>the ongoing GSL-LTTE peace talks, both sides are </p><p>discussing transforming the constitution and making it </p><p>federalist in structure, as opposed to unitary.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In a recent conversation about the JVP and SU </p><p>complaints, Kethesh Loganathan of the Center for Policy </p><p>Alternatives, a well-known local NGO, told us that both </p><p>parties were creating strawmen.  He noted that there had </p><p>been some discussion "over drinks" in academic circles </p><p>of these issues, including whether the country\'s name, </p><p>"Sri Lanka" (a name rich in Sinhalese associations), </p><p>should be changed back to the more neutral "Ceylon." </p><p>Nonetheless, there was no "secret plan" by the </p><p>government to change the flag and anthem, and he doubted </p><p>that there was any intention to do so. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Tirades by Sinhalese extremists against the </p><p>peace process seem to have generated little support for </p><p>their cause, thus far.  The extremists\' use of the five </p><p>issues reviewed above, however, highlights how they </p><p>continue to nibble away at the margins of the body </p><p>politic.  It is unclear whether their constant attacks </p><p>and forays into cultural nationalism are having an </p><p>effect at the village level in the Sinhalese hinterland </p><p>in the south.  If they are, it is possible that the </p><p>extremists could be putting themselves in position to </p><p>make political gains if the peace process hits a </p><p>stumbling block.  At this point, however, with the </p><p>process still buoyed by widespread public support, the </p><p>JVP and SU remain decidedly on the outside looking in </p><p>despite their best efforts.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
