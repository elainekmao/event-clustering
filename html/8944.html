<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001106 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-24-13 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV, Political Parties, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 95  (06-24-03) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires, </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  CHARGE MEETS WITH FOREIGN SECRETARY </p><p>-          PRESIDENT\'S PARTY HOLDS ANNUAL CONVENTION </p><p>-          PRO-TIGER DEMONSTRATION PLANNED FOR JAFFNA </p><p> </p><p>CHARGE MEETS WITH FOREIGN SECRETARY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) Charge Don Camp called on Foreign Secretary Nihal </p><p>Rodrigo today (June 24).  The Foreign Secretary thanked </p><p>the US for its continued support re the peace process and </p><p>for D\'s strong remarks at the recent Tokyo donors </p><p>conference.  He said the GSL had the same sentiments as </p><p>the US re resuming direct talks versus trading indirect </p><p>communications with the LTTE.  Regarding a June 24 </p><p>TamilNet report, which we review in a front-channel </p><p>today, Rodrigo thought the Tigers would wait for a solid </p><p>government announcement re an interim administration </p><p>before returning to the talks.  In regard to the PM\'s </p><p>visit to London, Rodrigo said the GSL\'s objectives were </p><p>to keep Britain informed about the peace process, and to </p><p>discuss visa and repatriation issues. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Charge delivered a dipnote to the Foreign </p><p>Secretary re the non-surrender agreement (Jim Waller/Joe </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Novak 06-21-03 class email) officially noting the USG\'s </p><p>entry into force of the accord.  Rodrigo responded that </p><p>the Cabinet had approved the agreement and it was </p><p>currently being cleared by appropriate ministers as a </p><p>formality.  He expected another couple of weeks before an </p><p>official GSL note was sent to us confirming the accord\'s </p><p>entry into force in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Please see our front-channel cable tomorrow </p><p>(June 25) on the Foreign Secretary\'s and Additional </p><p>Secretary Sarala Fernando\'s comments on SAARC and its </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>upcoming foreign secretaries meeting.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S PARTY HOLDS ANNUAL CONVENTION </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU) FYI.  On June 22, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party </p><p>(SLFP), the major faction in the Opposition People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA) coalition, held their annual convention </p><p>with President Kumaratunga, her brother Anura </p><p>Bandaranaike, Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapakse, and </p><p>former Dep. Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte as </p><p>headliners.  (Note:  As cited in Colombo 1079, Ratwatte </p><p>was denied bail from charges stemming from election day </p><p>violence in 2001 and attended the June 22 conference only </p><p>on special permission from the courts.)  Press reports </p><p>from the one-day meeting focused heavily on party </p><p>comments re the expected SLFP-JVP linkup (See Colombo </p><p>859, and previous).  The president stated that, "the two </p><p>parties have agreed on a practical and conceptual agenda </p><p>to rebuild the country." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Re the peace process, the president also used </p><p>the forum to complain that the GSL was letting the Sri </p><p>Lankan military grow weak, when it should be strengthened </p><p>vis-a-vis the LTTE.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRO-TIGER DEMONSTRATION PLANNED FOR JAFFNA </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) FYI.  A large-scale pro-LTTE demonstration is </p><p>scheduled for June 27 in Jaffna.  Called "Pongu Tamil" </p><p>(translation: "Rising Tamil") by the LTTE and its </p><p>supporters, the Tigers sponsored several of these rallies </p><p>around the island early last year when the peace process </p><p>was just beginning.
