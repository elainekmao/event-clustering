<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 02961 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PHUM, PREF, ET, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  CONVERSATION WITH FORMER PM SADIQ AL MAHDI </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON FORMER PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI JUNE 26.  SADIQ DESCRIBED THE </p><p>CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS HAVING THE WORST </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS OF DICTATORSHIP AND A COALITION </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE GOS, HE SAID, IS FAILING DISMALLY </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND CAUSING THE PEOPLE GREAT SUFFERING. </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER LAWS, HE DECLARED, MUST GO.  PEACE AND </p><p>A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN STOP THE SUDAN FROM BEING </p><p>A "MAVERICK" COUNTRY.  (COMMENT:  FOR THE FUTURE, IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT SADIQ WILL WAIT ON THE SIDELINES AS THE </p><p>AL BASHIR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES ITS DOWNWARD ECONOMIC </p><p>PLUNGE.  HE WILL THEN BE AVAILABLE TO PICK UP THE </p><p>PIECES. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT THE INVITATION OF SADIQ AL MAHDI AMBASSADOR </p><p>CALLED ON HIM JUNE 26.  THE ATMOSPHERE WAS </p><p>COMFORTABLE AND THE CONVERSATION RELAXED.  DCM </p><p>ATTENDED, SADIQ WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. SADIQ DESCRIBED THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS HAVING </p><p>THE WORST CHARACTERISTICS OF A DICTATORSHIP AND A </p><p>COALITION GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE SAID, IS </p><p>DIVIDED BETWEEN THE NIP UNDER HASSAN TURABI AND THE </p><p>ARMY, THOUGH HE IMPLIED THAT THE NIF HAD THE UPPER </p><p>HAND NOW.  HASSAN TURABI, SADIQ SAID, IS NOT A TRUE </p><p>ISLAMIST BUT ONE WHO USED ISLAM FOR THE POLITICAL </p><p>BENEFIT.  SADIQ COMMENTED THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED BY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NIP (ALI OSMAN TAHA AND IBRAHIM MAHDI </p><p>AMONG OTHERS) WHO WERE INTERESTED IN SECURING HIS </p><p>SUPPORT.  HE COMMENTED THE NIF HAD DIVISIONS AND </p><p>TURABI WAS AWARE OF THEM. PRESIDENT AL BASHIR HAD </p><p>ALSO VISITED HIM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TO DISCUSS </p><p>POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT/SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>SADIQ SAID.  SADIQ SPOKE WELL OF THE HONESTY OF AL </p><p>BASHIR BUT WAS LESS THAN COMPLIMENTARY REGARDING HIS </p><p>INTELLECTUAL ABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SADIQ WAS VISIBLY UPSET WITH WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS </p><p>THE GOS DISMAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WHICH HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED IS CAUSING PEOPLE GREAT SUFFERING.  HE </p><p>ALSO CONDEMNED THE GOS FOR NOT REQUESTING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AID FOR THE FAMINE VICTIMS AS HE HAD </p><p>DONE WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER.  AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>SADIQ AGREED THAT THE NIF, SPECIFICALLY HASSAN </p><p>TURABI, OPPOSED RELIEF AID EVEN IF ITS LACK WOULD </p><p>CAUSE THE DEATHS OF SUDANESE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEACE </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6. SADIQ APPRECIATED USG PEACE EFFORTS.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AT TIMES PROGRESS COULD NOT BE SEEN </p><p>BUT HE SAID THE USG MUST PERSEVERE IN THESE EFFORTS. </p><p>IT WAS ONLY A "GREAT POWER" LIKE THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WHICH COULD MOVE BOTH SIDES TOWARD PEACE. PEACE </p><p>REQUIRED A PLURALISTIC, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WHICH </p><p>RESPECTED HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, </p><p>SADIQ SAID THE SEPTEMBER LAWS "MUST GO".  AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROVIDED A BRIEFING ON USG PEACE EFFORTS AND GAVE A </p><p>COPY OF A/S COHEN\'S SPEECH ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION. </p><p>SADIQ REEMPHASIZED THAT PEACE AND A DEMOCRATIC, </p><p>PLURALISTIC GOVERNMENT WOULD KEEP THE SUDAN FROM </p><p>TURNING INTO A "MAVERICK COUNTRY".  PEACE WOULD ALSO </p><p>ALLOW SUDAN TO HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT: SADIQ SAID MANY THINGS WHICH HE KNEW THE </p><p>USG SUPPORTS.  HE IS IN FAVOR OF COOPERATION ON </p><p>RELIEF, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRATIC </p><p>SOCIETY.  IN SUPPORT OF THE LATTER, IS HIS STATEMENT </p><p>THAT THE SEPTEMBER LAWS MUST GO. </p><p> </p><p>8. SADIQ\'S ASSERTION THAT HE IS BEING VISITED BY THE </p><p>NIF AND OTHERS LOOKING FOR HIS SUPPORT IS TRUE. </p><p>SADIQ IS A WILY AND UNSCRUPULOUS POLITICIAN.  HE IS </p><p>POSITIONING HIMSELF IN THE EVENT THAT THIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>FALLS.  ONE SHOULD NOT TAKE HIS STATEMENT ON THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER LAWS AT FACE VALUE; HE DID NOT SAY HE </p><p>WANTED A SECULAR STATE.  SADIQ COULD FEEL COMFORTABLE </p><p>INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT.  HIS OPPOSITION TO </p><p>THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOCTRINE, IT IS OVER WHO HAS </p><p>POWER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
