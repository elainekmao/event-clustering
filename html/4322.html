<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 003105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: "PATRIOTS" ASK OBASANJO TO </p><p>FOREGO SECOND TERM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  ( C)  Summary: Chief Frederick  Rotimi Williams, prominent </p><p>Lagos attorney and charter member of the "Patriots", a group of </p><p>prominent Southern and Middle Belt figures, told Ambassador Jeter </p><p>on October 21 that the "Patriots" had issued a public statement urging </p><p>President Obasanjo not to seek re-election because his quest for re- </p><p>election was creating too much political tension.  Moreover, the </p><p>"Patrots" believe that and that the time is now ripe for a President </p><p>from the South-South.  Despite championing a South-South </p><p>Presidency, Williams could not readily name one viable candidate </p><p>from that region.  As part of their deliberations on reducing electoral </p><p>tension, the "Patriots" also proposed single term limits for the </p><p>President and State Governors.  Williams likewise called for a </p><p>National Conference to explore constitutional changes that would </p><p>allow all geopolitical zones equitable participation in national </p><p>leadership.  Williams felt that former military Head of State, Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida, as well as current Vice President Abubakar </p><p>Atiku would be unacceptable presidential candidates in the South. </p><p>Joining the Ambassador at the October 21 meeting were PolCouns </p><p>and Lagos PolOff. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During a visit to Lagos, Ambassador met Chief Rotimi </p><p>Williams at his law firm on October 21, to discuss the "Patriots"\' </p><p>October 15 press statement.  Williams, an imposing man with a </p><p>venerable presence, told the Ambassador that the "Patriots" saw </p><p>Obasanjo\'s quest for a second term as the primary factor in </p><p>Nigeria\'s roiling political equation.  If Obasanjo disavowed his </p><p>ambition, politics would calm considerably, Williams stated.  Thus, </p><p>for the sake of political sobriety and  equilibrium, the "Patriots" </p><p>concluded that Obasanjo should forego a second term.  Williams </p><p>continued that, by eschewing a second term, Obasanjo would be </p><p>helping to forge a new political reality in Nigeria.   For the next </p><p>elections and for the first time in Nigerian history, the Presidency </p><p>should go to the South-South. By stepping aside, Obasanjo would be </p><p>helping to facilitate this unprecedented development.   According to </p><p>Williams, the struggle for national power in Nigeria has been a </p><p>struggle between the three most important ethic groups: North/Hausa- </p><p>Fulani, Southwest/Yoruba and Southeast/Igbo.  Consequently, the </p><p>victorious political alliance would always be the one that joined two </p><p>of these three dominant groups.  Competition for national political </p><p>power has always centered on these groups with the usual winning </p><p>combination being a North/Southeast axis, leaving the Yoruba as the </p><p>odd man out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The North has used its perceived numerical majority to claim </p><p>superior, almost exclusive, title to national power, the veteran lawyer </p><p>argued.  Unfortunately, "The [purported] Northern majority has not </p><p>been properly taught how to exercise its majority right," he asserted. </p><p>This numerical majority had been used to gag the political aspirations </p><p>of the lesser ethnic groups, and because the larger ethnic groups were </p><p>not adequately enlightened, Williams saw a one-term presidency to be </p><p>rotated among the six geographical zones as key to a more equal </p><p>distribution of national power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>THE "PATRIOTS": AN OCCASIONAL GATHERING OF </p><p>EMINENT PEOPLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU)   The "Patriots" are an informal group that meets on an ad </p><p>hoc basis to discuss national issues.  Originally, the group had </p><p>seventeen members drawn  predominantly from the South and Middle </p><p>Belt.  In the years since its 1998  inception, the group has only </p><p>publicized the results of their deliberations on two previous </p><p>occasions.  Thus, the "Patriots" October 15 recommendations that the </p><p>President and Governors be limited to one five year terms attracted </p><p>significant media attention and have helped generate much public </p><p>debate.  A look at the credentials of some members of the group </p><p>shows why its opinions matter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The current Chairperson is Chief Frederick Rotimi Williams, one of </p><p>Nigeria\'s </p><p>most eminent lawyers.  Williams has served in senior government </p><p>positions since the mid-fifties and was Chairman of the Constitutional </p><p>Committee that drafted the 1979 Constitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Chief Richard  Akinjide is also a prominent attorney and recently </p><p>represented Nigeria before the International Court of Justice in the </p><p>dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Chief Felix Ibru is from a wealthy family that owns "The </p><p>Guardian", the second largest newspaper in Nigeria, as well as the </p><p>Lagos Sheraton; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Chiefs Abraham Adesanya and Ayo Adebanjo are members of the </p><p>preeminent Yoruba group, Afenifere; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Professor Ben Nwabueze, lawyer, businessman, and professor of </p><p>constitutional law is General Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Igbo </p><p>leadership group from the Southeast region. Nwabueze  is a long time </p><p>associate of former Head of State Babangida; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Dan Suleiman is retired military and a prominent Middle Belt figure </p><p>remembered  for having been forced into exile for having opposed </p><p>late military dictator, Sani Abacha; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Chief Matthew Tawo Mbu has had a long and successful career as a </p><p>businessman and head of many government Ministries.  He is from </p><p>Delta State in the South-South region and is the leader of the Union </p><p>of the Niger Delta, a leading socio-cultural group much like Afinefere </p><p>and Ohange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EVERYONE SHOULD GET THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The dominance of national power by the three biggest blocs </p><p>has progressively embittered the Southern minorities, according to </p><p>Williams. Although the South-South was the fount of the nation\'s </p><p>wealth, it has remained economically poor and politically </p><p>disadvantaged.  Continuation of this unjust situation would speed the </p><p>day of Nigeria\'s social and political explosion, he warned.   Thus, the </p><p>"Patriots" hoped that a South-South President would emerge in 2003. </p><p>While the "Patriots" realized they were asking Obasanjo to give up </p><p>his personal right to contest for office, rising dissatisfaction among </p><p>the minorities in the Delta could lead to violence, Williams feared. </p><p>Obasanjo should sacrifice his personal desires for the national good. </p><p>"Now is the time to rotate the Presidency to the South-South region, </p><p>"the Patriots have all agreed  that, to continue as a nation, the </p><p>ethnic </p><p>minorities must be heard." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)   However, the articulate Williams stammered when the </p><p>Ambassador asked him to identify a viable candidate from the South- </p><p>South.  Williams could only respond that he hoped the South-South </p><p>would put forward a credible candidate if given the opportunity.  He </p><p>expressed confidence that there were qualified people in </p><p>the South-South. These politicians should be given a chance at </p><p>national leadership and not excluded simply because they did not </p><p>have enough ethnic kinsmen to buoy their political status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)   Ambassador asked if a minority candidate from the South- </p><p>South region might raise public fears in other zones that this area had </p><p>finally gotten control of the oil revenue and would try to monopolize </p><p>it.  Williams countered that a candidate from the South-South would </p><p>bring the issue of resource and revenue allocation into the arena of </p><p>public debate.  "We believe," he said, "that there should be a budget </p><p>allocation to the Federal Government derived from the resources of </p><p>each state."  But the each State should be the primary </p><p>beneficiary of resources within its borders.  Off-shore resources, he </p><p>continued, must be controlled by the Federal Government because </p><p>only the Federal Government can and should maintain the functions </p><p>such as border patrols and coast guard necessary to protect those </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Williams continued that the "Patriots" had long supported a </p><p>"National Congress" to allow all groups, but especially ethnic </p><p>minorities, to "air their views and political aspirations,"  and </p><p>propose </p><p>changes to the constitutional structure to allow fuller participation </p><p>and </p><p>end the alleged "second class" political status of the ethnic </p><p>minorities. </p><p>The Constitution should be changed so that every group has an </p><p>opportunity to qualify for leadership of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OBASANJO VS. THE "PATRIOTS" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) When the Ambassador asked Williams about Obasanjo\'s </p><p>reaction to the Patriot\'s suggestion, Williams said Obasanjo rejected </p><p>it.   The President felt he had a right to contest and did not want to </p><p>surrender that right.  Obasanjo had been personally affronted and </p><p>"very annoyed" because many of the "Patriots" were long-time </p><p>friends and associates.  He felt the "Patriots" should have </p><p>discussed their proposal with him privately before going public. </p><p>Williams contended that this was not a private matter but an issue of </p><p>national concern requiring public debate.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>questioned whether the fact that prominent members of Afenifere </p><p>were part of the "Patriots" group would hurt Obasanjo\'s  bid </p><p>for re-election in that it looked like some important Yorubas were </p><p>now against him. (Comment.  Afenifere is the most influential </p><p>organization in the Yoruba Southwest.  Although Yoruba, Obasanjo </p><p>did not carry this region in the 1999 elections.  The Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD), which is closely associated with Afenifere, controls </p><p>most of the Southwest.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C )  Williams explained that the "Patriots" opposed the </p><p>impeachment threat against Obasanjo because it was ill-timed, based </p><p>on questionable motives, and could raise ethnic tensions. The </p><p>impeachment was perceived in the Southwest as an assault by </p><p>Northern politicians against a Yoruba, albeit not a very popular one. </p><p>Thus, the "Patriots" opposed  impeachment because it would damage </p><p>the political system in their  view;  they opposed Obasanjo\'s second </p><p>term for the same reason, he contended.  When asked whether the </p><p>"Patriots" "tried to save Obasanjo (from impeachment)  so that he </p><p>could sacrifice himself ( not seek reelection)," Williams nodded in </p><p>agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELL ALMOST EVERYONE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   (C )  The Ambassador asked Williams whether the South would </p><p>accept former military ruler Ibrahim Babangida or current Vice </p><p>President Abubakar Atiku as President.  Williams was adamant that </p><p>elevation of either to the Presidency would risk "the unity of the </p><p>nation."  Despite the current four years of a Yoruba President, the </p><p>"Patriots" believe that the Northern "ruling class" had held power for </p><p>too long; now was not the time for a Northern President.  When asked </p><p>about a candidate from the Southeast, Williams stated that since the </p><p>Igbos have only held power during the abbreviated Ironsi military </p><p>government in the sixties, an Igbo President would not be </p><p>objectionable.  He noted several possible candidates from the Igbo </p><p>Southeast.  When asked about reports that the North was courting the </p><p>Southeast to finger a pliable Igbo candidate and that the "Patriots" </p><p>stance could actually be facilitating this agenda, Williams shrugged, </p><p>acknowledging the possibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  There is no significant political event in Nigeria without </p><p>the </p><p>Babangida factor attached to it. The Patriot\'s statement is no </p><p>exception.  Rumor has it that IBB warned Igbo members of the </p><p>"Patriots" that power would shift to the North in 2007 for at least </p><p>eight years.  Thus, the chances of these old men seeing an Igbo </p><p>President within their lifetime was nil unless that happened in 2003. </p><p>Consequently, when the "Patriots" met, the Igbos unleashed a brutal </p><p>indictment of Obasanjo which changed the course of the discussion </p><p>toward the eventual conclusion that Obasanjo should not run. </p><p>However, some "Patriots" were angered by the group\'s statement. </p><p>They claimed they were not invited to the meeting because of their </p><p>alleged pro-Obasanjo tendencies, and they have publicly disavowed </p><p>the October 15 statement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  The "Patriots" like many other groups are trying to help </p><p>Nigeria find a way out of its current political impasse.  However, </p><p>despite the claim to be elder statesmen, the "Patriots" are not a </p><p>detached, dispassionate group.  The October 15 statement was </p><p>peppered by political considerations.  For a variety of reasons, many </p><p>"Patriots" dislike Obasanjo and the October 15 statement reflected </p><p>that.  Because it was endorsed by some prominent Yoruba figures, it </p><p>caused Obasanjo some unexpected damage.  However, given the </p><p>fluidity of political events now, that damage might not be permanent </p><p>as the memory of the statement is eclipsed by the frenzy of other </p><p>political events. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14 . (C)  On another level, Williams\' assertion about a South-South </p><p>Presidential candidate and the end to the top three ethnic groups\' </p><p>dominance seemed surprisingly naive if taken at face value.  Clearly, </p><p>not all the "Patriots" agreed with this position. Last week, Ohaneze </p><p>Ndigbo met with the Northern leadership group, Arewa </p><p>Consultative Forum.  That meeting produced a public statement </p><p>against Obasanjo\'s second term.  We can be almost certain that the </p><p>participants also discussed conditions for resurrecting the North- </p><p>Southeast political axis that has been successful in the past. </p><p>Contrary </p><p>to Williams\' assertion that the "Patriots" back a South-South </p><p>Presidency, the Ohaneze leadership has been carrying the torch for an </p><p>Igbo Presidency and it is doubtful that Ohaneze will voluntarily </p><p>extinguish that flame. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  Perhaps Williams has staked out this position in order to </p><p>hedge  possible Yoruba  political  losses.  Maybe he and others sense </p><p>that Obasanjo is a less than an even bet ( a growing belief among </p><p>political pundits, even some of Obasanjo\'s own men).  Instead of </p><p>backing the wrong horse, some Yorubas may have decided to </p><p>champion the idea of a South-South Presidency as the best possible </p><p>alternative. If the Igbos were convinced this was a good option, this </p><p>plan of a united South would keep national power in the South, thus </p><p>preventing the historic North-Southeast alliance that has often </p><p>resulted in the Yoruba Southwest being on the losing side of national </p><p>elections. Second, a South-South presidency would keep power out of </p><p>Igbo hands. For historic reasons, Yorubas and Igbos do not repose </p><p>much trust in each other. Yoruba Leader Olufemi Awolowo </p><p>undermined the Igbo leader Nnandi Azikiwe\'s quest for national </p><p>power in the late sixties. Since then, political cooperation between </p><p>the </p><p>two groups has been minimal.   Older Yoruba leaders like Williams </p><p>probably still fear that the Igbo still bear a grudge. Moreover, the </p><p>Yorubas may back the idea of a South-South minority President </p><p>because they believe they can influence a South-South incumbent. </p><p>The Southern minorities historically have been wary of  Igbo </p><p>domination, and are more comfortable with  the Yorubas  If this is </p><p>Williams\' tack, then his support for a South-South President is not </p><p>based on principles of fairness for the ethnic minorities but concern </p><p>that the North- Southeast alliance not be repeated to the detriment of </p><p>Southwest in the 2003 elections. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
