(U) THIS IS ONE IN A SERIES OF REPORTS OF INTERVIEWS </p><p>WITH WAR CRIMES VICTIMS CONDUCTED IN LATE 1993 IN MAOCA, </p><p>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BY AN OFDA (DART/ZAGREB) FIELD </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AND AN AMCIT IRC REPRESENTATIVE WHILE THEY </p><p>WERE IN THE AREA ASSESSING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS. </p><p>THIS REPORT, LIKE THE OTHERS, NAMES  VICTIMS AND, IN SOME </p><p>CASES, PERPETRATORS AND THE DETAILS OF SPECIFIC CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WITNESS INFORMATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (LOU)  THE WITNESS, AJKUNA MUMINOVIC (STRICTLY </p><p>PROTECT), WAS BORN SEPTEMBER 26, 1952.  SHE WAS A RESIDENT </p><p>OF VLASENICA, A SMALL TOWN ABOUT 60 MILES BY ROAD </p><p>NORTHEAST OF SARAJEVO, FROM 1964 TO JUNE, 1992. SHE WAS </p><p>EMPLOYED IN A BANK AS AN OFFICE CLEANER AND MESSENGER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE WITNESS\'S ACCOUNT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ON JUNE 11, 1992 THE WITNESS AND HER HUSBAND </p><p>ESCAPED FROM VLASENICA AND WENT TO CERSKA.  THERE SHE </p><p>WORKED AS A COOK FOR THE BOSNIAN ARMY UNTIL AUGUST 21, </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01222  01 OF 03  280721Z </p><p>1992.  ON THAT DAY SHE CONVINCED HER HUSBAND TO COME WITH </p><p>HER AND WALK TO THE VILLAGE OF SUCESKA, NEAR SREBRENICA, </p><p>WHERE, SHE HAD HEARD, HER SON, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND </p><p>GRANDCHILD WERE LIVING.  SHE AND HER HUSBAND LEFT ON FOOT, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY THREE OTHERS.  ON THE WAY, THEY CAME UPON A </p><p>"CHETNIK" (SERBIAN ARMY) BARRICADE AND WERE FIRED ON.  THE </p><p>WITNESS WAS SHOT IN BOTH LEGS.  HER HUSBAND AND THE THREE </p><p>OTHERS RAN AWAY.  SHE COULD HEAR THE FIRING CONTINUING FOR </p><p>SOME TIME.  AFTER IT STOPPED, SHE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE BUT </p><p>COULD NOT, AND NOTICED SHE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD. </p><p>NIGHT WAS FALLING AND SHE WAS AFRAID DOGS MIGHT COME AND </p><p>ATTACK HER.  SHE CALLED FOR HELP THREE OR FOUR TIMES, BUT </p><p>THEN PASSED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  WHEN THE WITNESS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS, SHE </p><p>COULD HEAR THE "CHETNIKS" TALKING ABOUT HER.  THEY THOUGHT </p><p>SHE WAS A MAN.  SHE TOLD THEM SHE WAS A WOMAN; THEY ASKED </p><p>HER WHY SHE HAD NOT SURRENDERED, SINCE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>SHOT AT A WOMAN.  THEY SAID THEY HAD MISTAKEN HER FOR A </p><p>SCOUT, OR SPY.  SHE INFORMED THEM SHE WAS ONLY TRYING TO </p><p>FIND HER SON.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION THEY TOOK HER TO THE </p><p>ROAD, WHERE HER WOUNDS WERE BANDAGED.  SOME TIME LATER SHE </p><p>WAS TAKEN BY CAR TO THE LOCAL CLINIC IN KRAVICA, NEAR </p><p>BRATUNAC.  SHE WAS GIVEN INJECTIONS AND REBANDAGED AND </p><p>TAKEN ONWARD TO A HOSPITAL IN BRATUNAC, WHERE SHE WAS </p><p>ADMITTED AND GIVEN A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  AN HOUR OR SO AFTER SHE ARRIVED AT THE BRATUNAC </p><p>HOSPITAL A SOLDIER CAME TO INTERROGATE HER.  HE ASKED </p><p>WERE SHE WAS GOING AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING.  HE TOLD HER </p><p>THAT IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH HE WOULD TAKE OUT THE </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01222  01 OF 03  280721Z </p><p>TRANSFUSION AND SHE WOULD DIE.  SHE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE </p><p>KNEW.  LATER, SHE WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO ZVORNIK </p><p>HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE WAS TREATED BY DR. ZORAN LAZAREVIC, A </p><p>PHYSICIAN SHE KNEW FROM VLASENICA.  HE TREATED HER VERY </p><p>KINDLY.  SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SEVEN MONTHS, FROM </p><p>AUGUST 21, 1992 TO MARCH 23, 1993. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  ON MARCH 23 SHE WAS TAKEN FROM THE HOSPITAL BY </p><p>SERBIAN POLICE, WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS BEING TAKEN TO GIVE A </p><p>STATEMENT REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER INJURY. </p><p>HOWEVER, NO STATEMENT WAS TAKEN.  INSTEAD SHE WAS TAKEN TO </p><p>A PRISON AT NOVI IZVOR.  FIVE MEN AND FOUR OTHER WOMEN </p><p>WERE HELD WITH HER ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN SEPARATE ROOMS. </p><p>THEY WERE GUARDED BUT WERE ALLOWED TO USE THE TOILET, WERE </p><p>FED, AND HAD BLANKETS AND FOAM BLOCKS FOR BEDS. FROM TIME </p><p>TO </p><p> TIME OTHER "CHETNIKS" WOULD COME AND ASK TO SEE THE </p><p>MUSLIMS.  THEY WOULD BEAT THE MEN; THE WOMEN COULD HEAR </p><p>SCREAMS IN THE NEXT ROOM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THE OTHER WOMEN IN THE ROOM WITH THE WITNESS WERE </p><p>A 73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, FATA (NFI), 65-YEAR-OLD HATA KARIC </p><p>AND HER 11-YEAR-OLD HALF-SERBIAN GRANDDAUGHTER, ALMA.

HATA </p><p>AND ALMA WERE ALLOWED VISITORS AND WERE GIVEN FAVORABLE </p><p>TREATMENT.  THEY OFTEN DRANK COFFEE WITH THE GUARDS AND </p><p>USED THEIR INFLUENCE TO HAVE THE WITNESS TREATED MORE </p><p>SEVERELY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE WITNESS SAID SHE BECAME FRIENDS WITH ONE MAN, </p><p>HASSAN (NFI), BEING DETAINED ON THE SAME FLOOR.  HATA DID </p><p>NOT APPROVE, AND TOLD THE GUARDS HE WAS AN EXTREMIST.  AS </p><p>A RESULT, THE WITNESS SAID, HASSAN WAS VERY BADLY BEATEN. </p><p>HE HAD FOOTPRINTS ON HIS BODY FROM BEING STOMPED ON AND </p><p>WAS VERY SWOLLEN  AFTER THE BEATING HASSAN WAS </p><p>TRANSFERRED TO THE FLOOR ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  WHILE IMPRISONED AT NOVI IZVOR, THE WITNESS WAS </p><p>ORDERED TO CLEAN ROOMS AND MAKE COFFEE.  WHEN SHE PLEADED </p><p>WITH HER CAPTORS NOT TO FORCE SUCH WORK UPON HER BECAUSE </p><p>OF PAINS IN HER WOUNDED LEGS, SHE WAS BEATEN.  SHE WAS </p><p>INSULTED AND TOLD SHE WAS BEING TREATED WELL IN COMPARISON </p><p>TO THE TREATMENT A SERB WOULD RECEIVE AT THE HANDS OF </p><p>MUSLIMS. </p><p>10. (U)  AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE WITNESS WAS PLACED </p><p>IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.  SHE BLAMED THIS ON HATA\'S </p><p>CONTINUAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT HER.  SHE WAS HELD IN SOLITARY </p><p>CONFINEMENT FOR ONE WEEK;  DURING THAT TIME SHE WAS GIVEN </p><p>ONLY ONE MEAL.  SHE WAS TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE COMMON </p><p>ROOM FOR A SHORT TIME, THEN SENT BACK TO SOLITARY </p><p>CONFINEMENT AGAIN.  AT THE TIME OF HER ARRIVAL AT THE </p><p>PRISON, THE PRINCIPAL GUARD WAS ONE "DUSAN" (NFI).  WHEN </p><p>HE LEFT, HE WAS REPLACED BY "MIRKO" AND "RATKO." </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01222  02 OF 03  280722Z </p><p>11.  (U)  THE WITNESS RECOUNTED HOW SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  ON ONE OF THESE, SHE SAID, "WHEN I HAD </p><p>MADE COFFEE FOR MIRKO I MOVED HIS GUN SLIGHTLY TO PUT THE </p><p>COFFEE DOWN.  HE YELLED AT ME AND PUNCHED ME TWICE, HARD. </p><p>THEN HE ORDERED HASSAN BROUGHT DOWN FROM UPSTAIRS.  HE </p><p>GAVE HASSAN A RUBBER STICK AND ORDERED HIM TO BEAT ME ON </p><p>THE BACK.  I WAS FORCED TO STAND AGAINST A WALL.  HASSAN </p><p>DID NOT BEAT ME HARD. THEN MIRKO TOOK THE STICK AND HIT </p><p>HASSAN IN THE NECK HARD, TO SHOW HIM HOW HE SHOULD BEAT </p><p>ME."  AS A RESULT OF THE BLOW, SHE SAID, HASSAN COULD NOT </p><p>SPEAK FOR 3 DAYS AFTERWARDS.  UNDER THIS DURESS, HASSAN </p><p>STRUCK HER VIOLENTLY 12 TIMES IN THE KIDNEY REGION.  AS </p><p>HASSAN WAS ADMINISTERING THE BEATING, MIRKO SAID </p><p>SARCASTICALLY THAT HE WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE HER HARMED, </p><p>AND THAT IT WAS HER OWN PEOPLE WHO WERE BEATING HER. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE WITNESS WAS RETURNED TO </p><p>SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.  THREE DAYS LATER, DUSAN REAPPEARED </p><p>AND SPOKE TO MIRKO AND RATKO.  HE CAME TO THE WITNESS\'S </p><p>ROOM BRINGING TWO YOUNG BOSNIANS, 17 AND 18 YEARS OLD, WHO </p><p>HAD BEEN CAPTURED FLEEING FROM CERSKA TO TUZLA.  THE TWO </p><p>BOYS WERE VERY FRIGHTENED, THE WITNESS SAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  THE WITNESS SAID DUSAN ORDERED HER AND THE TWO </p><p>BOYS TO REMOVE ALL THEIR CLOTHES.  HE FORCED HER TO BEND </p><p>OVER AND ORDERED ONE OF THE BOYS TO SODOMIZE HER WHILE </p><p>FORCING HER TO PERFORM ORAL SEX ON THE OTHER.  WHEN SHE </p><p>COMPLAINED OF INTENSE PAIN IN HER INJURED LEGS, DUSAN </p><p>ALLOWED HER TO LIE DOWN BUT CONTINUED TO FORCE THE TWO </p><p>YOUNG BOSNIANS TO VIOLATE HER, BOTH ORALLY AND VAGINALLY. </p><p>AFTER SOME TIME, SHE SAID, DUSAN ASKED THE TWO BOYS IF </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01222  02 OF 03  280722Z </p><p>THEY WERE SATISFIED, AND SAID HE WOULD COME BACK THE NEXT </p><p>DAY WITH TWO OTHER MEN. </p><p>14.  (U)  AT ABOUT 1:00 A.M. THAT MORNING MIRKO CAME INTO </p><p>HER ROOM.  HE SAT IN A CHAIR AND ORDERED HER TO PERFORM </p><p>ORAL SEX ON HIM.  WHEN SHE RESISTED HE RAPED HER ANALLY. </p><p>HE TOLD HER NOT TO TELL ANYONE.  SHE BLED A GREAT DEAL AS </p><p>A RESULT OF THIS ASSAULT, THE WITNESS SAID. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) LATER THAT MORNING MIRKO CAME INTO HER ROOM. </p><p>SEEING THE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR, HE ASKED WHAT IT WAS.  WHEN </p><p>SHE TOLD HIM IT WAS THE RESULT OF HIS ASSAULT ON HER </p><p>EARLIER THAT MORNING, HE ORDERED HE </p><p>R TO CLEAN IT UP AND </p><p>NOT TO TELL ANYONE.  AT THIS POINT THE WITNESS, STILL </p><p>BLOODY FROM MIRKO\'S ASSAULT, BEGAN TO MENSTRUATE.  THE </p><p>GUARD RATKO TOLD HER TO TAKE A BATH BUT SHE DEMURRED, </p><p>SAYING SHE COULD NOT BECAUSE OF HER PERIOD.  EVERY DAY </p><p>THEY ORDERED HER TO TAKE A BATH AND EVERY DAY SHE REFUSED </p><p>CLAIMING SHE WAS MENSTRUATING.  AT ONE POINT MIRKO ASKED </p><p>HER WHAT SHE WOULD THINK WHEN DUSAN STARTED SENDING </p><p>"CLIENTS" TO HER.  SHE KNEW MIRKO OWNED A CAFE, SHE SAID, </p><p>AND SUSPECTED HE WOULD FORCE HER INTO PROSTITUTION IF SHE </p><p>WERE TO TAKE A BATH.  THUS SHE CONTINUED TO CLAIM SHE HAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01222  03 OF 03  280722Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     OASY-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      EB-01    EUR-01   OIGO-01  HA-09    H-01     IMMC-01  TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-16    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-01    PRS-01   P-01     RP-10    RPCS-01  SCT-03 </p><p>      SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00  RPE-01 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-02  PMB-00     /058W </p><p>                  ------------------34FCA7  280723Z /38 </p><p>R 280716Z MAR 94 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1352 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 001222 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/EE, L, HA, IO </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM PREF MOPS PINS HR BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFSROL:  SEVERE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN BOSNIA- </p><p>          HERZEGOVINA:  VICTIM\'S REPORT OF BEATINGS AND </p><p>          RAPE AT NOVI IZVOR PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01222  03 OF 03  280722Z </p><p>HER PERIOD AND REFUSED TO BATHE FOR A LONG TIME.

RATKO WAS ON TRANQUILIZERS, FOR WHICH MIRKO </p><p>BLAMED THE MUSLIMS.  ON ONE OCCASION MIRKO TRIED TO FORCE </p><p>THE WITNESS TO TAKE A DOSE OF THESE TRANQUILIZER PILLS; </p><p>WHEN SHE STEPPED BACKWARD TO AVOID THIS, HE PUNCHED HER IN </p><p>THE FACE.  MIRKO STOPPED RATKO FROM CONTINUING TO BEAT </p><p>HER. </p><p> </p><p>17.

AT THAT TIME, HOWEVER, SHE WAS GREATLY </p><p>DISTRAUGHT, HAVING JUST LEARNED OF THE DEATH OF HER SON. </p><p>DR.

HE </p><p>THREATENED NEVER TO EXCHANGE HER UNTIL THEY WERE REMOVED, </p><p>BECAUSE  SUCH PLATES WERE BADLY NEEDED BY WOUNDED SERB </p><p>SOLDIERS. IF SHE WAS RELEASED THEY WOULD BE USED ON </p><p>MUSLIMS, HE SAID.  NONETHELESS SHE WAS EXCHANGED, WITH THE </p><p>PLATES STILL IN HER LEGS, ON JULY 21, 1993.
