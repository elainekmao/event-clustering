NOT FOR </p><p>INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) ON MARCH 1, GEORGE WALLS CALLED ON POLOFF TO </p><p>RELAY THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE ATTACK ON HIM BY </p><p>SUSPECTED WAR VETERANS THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 23.  WALLS </p><p>IS THE SON OF PETER WALLS, FORMER COMMANDER OF THE </p><p>RHODESIAN ARMY UNDER THE IAN SMITH REGIME.  THE FEBRUARY </p><p>26 EDITION OF "THE DAILY NEWS" REPORTED THE ATTACK ON </p><p>THE YOUNGER WALLS IN A HEADLINE STORY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) WALLS TOLD POLOFF THAT "THE DAILY NEWS" STORY </p><p>WAS GENERALLY ACCURATE.  AROUND 10:15 PM ON FEBRUARY 23, </p><p>WHILE WALLS WAS DRIVING TO HIS SUBURBAN HARARE HOME, </p><p>FOUR MEN IN ANOTHER VEHICLE PULLED A GUN ON HIM AND </p><p>FORCED HIM TO STOP.  THREE OF THE MEN, SHABBILY DRESSED, </p><p>ACCORDING TO WALLS, GOT OUT AND DEMANDED TO KNOW THE </p><p>LOCATION OF HIS FATHER.  (NOTE: IT WAS REPORTED IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2000 THAT WALLS\' FATHER HAD BEEN SEEN IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE AT VICTORIA FALLS.  THE JUNIOR WALLS SAID IT </p><p>WAS COMPLETELY FALSE, AS HIS FATHER HAD NOT BEEN TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN 21 YEARS, AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD </p><p>MISTAKEN A BRITISH NATIONAL NAMED PETER WELLS FOR HIS </p><p>FATHER.  END NOTE.)  WALLS STATED THAT THE MEN CLAIMED </p><p>TO BE "LIBERATION FIGHTERS."  HE NEVER CLAIMED THEY WERE </p><p>CIO OPERATIVES, AS REPORTED IN "THE DAILY NEWS."  WALLS </p><p>SAID HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT A CIO AGENT LOOKED LIKE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00881  011512Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) WHEN HE DENIED THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY, THE THREE MEN PROCEEDED TO BEAT WALLS.  ONE </p><p>STRUCK HIM IN THE FACE WITH AN ELECTRICAL CORD, WHICH </p><p>PRODUCED A DEEP GASH FROM HIS FOREHEAD TO BELOW HIS </p><p>RIGHT EYE, AND PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE.  ANOTHER STABBED </p><p>HIM IN HIS RIGHT THIGH, HE STATED.  (COMMENT: WALLS </p><p>CLEARLY HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED.  HIS FACE WAS </p><p>COVERED WITH BANDAGES AND HE WALKED WITH A NOTICEABLE </p><p>LIMP.  END COMMENT.)  THE ATTACKERS WARNED WALLS THAT IF </p><p>HE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE POLICE, THEY WOULD </p><p>RETURN AND KILL HIM.  A PASSER-BY TOOK WALLS TO THE </p><p>HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AND TREATED FOR THREE </p><p>DAYS.  THE GASH TO HIS FACE REQUIRED PLASTIC SURGERY, </p><p>WALLS SAID.  HIS SISTER WENT TO THE POLICE AND MADE A </p><p>STATEMENT.  THEY WERE SYMPATHETIC, WALLS REPORTED, BUT </p><p>HE DID NOT KNOW IF THEY WERE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>INCIDENT.  WALLS SAID HE RECEIVED A THREATENING PHONE </p><p>CALL THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 28. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) POLOFF ASKED WALLS WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>LED TO THE INCIDENT.  HE STATED HE DID NOT REALLY KNOW. </p><p>HIS FATHER IS ACTUALLY LIVING IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND HE </p><p>BELIEVES THE ZIMBABWEAN AUTHORITIES KNOW THIS.  IN FACT, </p><p>THE CIO HAD SENT HIS FATHER A LETTER THERE 10 YEARS AGO </p><p>STATING THAT THEY HAD RECOMMENDED TO PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>THAT WALLS BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO ZIMBABWE.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT NEVER FORMALLY GAVE PERMISSION, SO THE OLDER </p><p>WALLS STAYED IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE SON REPORTED.  HE ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT IN APRIL 2000, THREE WELL-DRESSED CIO AGENTS </p><p>HAD PAID HIM A VISIT AND POLITELY WARNED HIM AGAINST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00881  011512Z </p><p>PURSUING POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.  SINCE THEN, WALLS HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN THREATENED IN ANY WAY UNTIL NOW.  HE SPECULATED </p><p>THAT UNION WORKERS AT HIS PLANT MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING </p><p>TO DO WITH IT, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WARNED HIM A WEEK </p><p>BEFORE THAT WAR VETERANS WOULD BE COMING AFTER HIM. </p><p>WALLS SAID THAT WORKERS AT HIS PLANT SOMETIMES GET </p><p>MILITANT WHEN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS COME UP, BUT THAT </p><p>THEY ARE NOT SCHEDULED UNTIL JULY, AND BESIDES, HE IS </p><p>ONLY A MIDDLE MANAGER AND WOULD BE THE WRONG PERSON TO </p><p>THREATEN.  WALLS TOLD POLOFF THAT HE BELIEVED THE ATTACK </p><p>HAD BEEN WELL-PLANNED AND ROBBERY WAS DEFINITELY NOT A </p><p>MOTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) COMMENT:  THE ASSAULT ON WALLS IS UNUSUAL </p><p>BECAUSE IT OCCURRED IN A LOW-DENSITY SUBURB OF HARARE </p><p>AGAINST A WHITE PERSON OF SYMBOLIC VALUE, BASED ON WHO </p><p>HIS FATHER WAS.  THAT HE IS APOLITICAL MADE NO </p><p>DIFFERENCE TO HIS ATTACKERS.  GIVEN INCREASED WAR </p><p>VETERAN ACTIVITY AND A CRACKDOWN ON GOVERNMENT OPPONENTS </p><p>IN URBAN AREAS, WE SUSPECT THAT THE ATTACK ON WALLS WAS </p><p>CARRIED OUT TO INTIMIDATE AND STRIKE FEAR INTO URBAN </p><p>WHITES, A KEY SOURCE OF SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
