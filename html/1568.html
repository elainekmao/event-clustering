<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, EAP/EX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, ASEAN, ARF </p><p>SUBJECT:  DAS BOYCE MEETING WITH VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LE CONG PHUNG ON ARF AND ASEAN ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>1.   EAP DAS BOYCE MET FEBRUARY 28 WITH LE CONG PHUNG, VICE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR ASEAN AFFAIRS, TO DISCUSS A </p><p>RANGE OF ISSUES CONCERNING ASEAN AND THE ASEAN REGIONAL </p><p>FORUM (ARF).  MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTORS PHAM HUU </p><p>CHI AND TRAN NGOC AN, AND AMERICAS DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DOAN </p><p>XUAN HUNG, SAT IN ON THE VIETNAMESE SIDE.  EAP/RSP DIRECTOR </p><p>JUDITH STROTZ AND EAP/RSP OFFICER DEAN YAP ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BOYCE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00539  01 OF 03  080245Z </p><p> </p><p>INTERSESSIONAL SUPPORT GROUP PROCESS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.   DAS BOYCE SAID THAT IN THE U.S. VIEW THE ISG IS THE </p><p>HEART OF THE ARF, WHERE THE INVISIBLE WORK GETS DONE THAT </p><p>ENABLES VISIBLE PROGRESS.  THE U.S. IS CONCERNED OVER LACK </p><p>OF PROGRESS AT THE SEOUL ISG, ALONG WITH OTHER ARF MEMBERS, </p><p>AND PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING TO HELP PROMOTE ISG </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS: </p><p> </p><p>     -- MOVEMENT TO TOPIC-BASED DISCUSSIONS ON REGIONAL </p><p>SECURITY, RATHER THAN SET PIECES FROM THE VARIOUS </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  OTHER ARF MEMBERS HAVE RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO </p><p>THIS IDEA, AND IT WORKED WELL IN SINGAPORE.  THE U.S HOPES </p><p>THE SEOUL ISG CAN BE ARRANGED THIS WAY. </p><p> </p><p>     -- CONTINUATION AT THE KL ISG OF THE VOLUNTARY </p><p>BRIEFINGS HELD IN SEOUL.  THE U.S. WOULD LIKE TO BRIEF THE </p><p>ARF ON CINCPAC ADMIRAL BLAIR\'S PROPOSAL FOR ENHANCED </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>     -- INCREASED TIME FOR THE DEFENSE OFFICIALS\' MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>     -- BEEFING UP SUBSTANTIVE EXPERTISE AT THE EXPERTS\' </p><p>GROUP MEETING (EGM) FOLLOWING THE KL ISG, RATHER THAN </p><p>LETTING THIS FORUM BECOME BOGGED DOWN BY GENERALISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   PHUNG DEFENDED THE SEOUL ISG AND SAID VIETNAM IS TRYING </p><p>ITS BEST AS CHAIR TO MOVE THE ARF PROCESS FORWARD.  HE </p><p>RESISTED THE SUGGESTION OF TOPIC-BASED SECURITY DISCUSSIONS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00539  01 OF 03  080245Z </p><p>SAYING IT BREAKS WITH LONG-HELD PRECEDENT AND IS TOO CHAOTIC </p><p>IN A FORUM WITH 23 MEMBERS.  A SET AGENDA PROVIDES BETTER </p><p>STRUCTURE FOR DISCUSSIONS.  PHUNG WELCOMED THE IDEA OF </p><p>CONTINUED VOLUNTARY BRIEFINGS, HOWEVER, AND SAID VIETNAM </p><p>WILL NOTIFY ASEAN COUNTERPARTS TO LOOK FOR THE U.S. </p><p>CONTRIBUTION, AND TO PREPARE ANY BRIEFINGS THEY MAY WANT TO </p><p>PRESENT.  THE ONLY STIPULATION IS THAT SUCH BRIEFINGS MUST </p><p>BE RELEVANT TO THE ISG.  PHUNG ALSO UNDERTOOK TO INSTRUCT </p><p>EGM PARTICIPANTS TO FOCUS MORE ON CONCRETE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>ARF WORKING PAPERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.   PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY PRINCIPLES:  DAS BOYCE EXPRESSED </p><p>THE U.S. VIEW THAT FORWARD MOVEMENT ON THE DRAFT ARF WORKING </p><p>PAPERS IS A KEY TO PROGRESS IN THE ARF.  THE U.S. IS WILLING </p><p>TO SEE THE PAPER ON PD PRINCIPLES PASSED AS IS, AS A </p><p>"SNAPSHOT" OF CURRENT THINKING ON THE ISSUE.  PHUNG </p><p>RESPONDED THAT VIETNAM HAS CIRCULATED THE PAPER, BUT </p><p>REACTIONS ARE NOT ALL YET IN.  HE DID REMARK THAT ASEAN IS </p><p>"SERIOUSLY STUDYING" THIS PAPER, AND HOPES TO HAVE CONSENSUS </p><p>BY KL. </p><p> </p><p>5.   ROLE OF THE ARF CHAIR:  BOYCE SAID THE U.S. BELIEVES </p><p>THE CHAIR NEEDS TO HAVE AN "EARLY WARNING" FUNCTION, THE </p><p>ABILITY TO FLAG ISSUES WHICH NEED ATTENTION, AND AUTHORITY </p><p>TO CONVENE MEETINGS IF NECESSARY AND IF GROUP CONSENSUS </p><p>EXISTS.   PHUNG WAS NON-COMMITTAL, NOTING ONLY THAT THE </p><p>DRAFT PAPER WILL BE ON THE AGENDA AT THE KL ISG, AND </p><p>DISCUSSION SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO THE SOM OR MINISTERIAL </p><p>LEVEL IF NECESSARY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00539  01 OF 03  080245Z </p><p> </p><p>6.   PHUNG EXPRESSED VIETNAM\'S GREAT APPRECIATION FOR RECENT </p><p>INVITATIONS TO VIETNAM AS THE ARF CHAIR TO ATTEND A PACOM </p><p>LEGAL CONFERENCE AND UNDERTAKE REGIONAL FAMILIARIZATION </p><p>TRAVEL (THE LATTER INVITATION INCLUDES BRUNEI, AS FUTURE ARF </p><p>CHAIR).  PHUNG SAID THE PACOM INVITATION WENT TO THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE FOR CONSIDERATION; IT WAS </p><p>LIKELY THE MND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND IN TIME TO </p><p>ACCEPT THE INVITATION.  VIETNAM WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND </p><p>IN ANY EVENT IN THE CAPACITY OF ARF CHAIR, AS THERE WAS NO </p><p>PRECEDENT.  THE REGIONAL TRAVEL INVITATION WILL BE AN ISSUE </p><p>OF DISCUSSION AT THE MARCH ASEAN SOM IN HO CHI MINH CITY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH PHUNG NOTED THAT VIETNAM\'S REMAINING TIME AS ARF </p><p>CHAIR IS SHORT. </p><p> </p><p>7.   EXPERTS AND EMINENT PERSONS REGISTER:  DAS BOYCE </p><p>EXPRESSED THE U.S. VIEW THAT THE EEP REGISTER SHOULD </p><p>REPRESENT A PROBLEM-SOLVING GROUP, RATHER THAN JUST A </p><p>RESEARCH BODY.  HAVING THE SCOPE TO OFFER OPINIONS WOULD </p><p>ATTRACT MORE TRUE EXPERTISE TO THE REGISTER, WHICH COULD BE </p><p>A VALUABLE RESOURCE -- SUBJECT ALWAYS TO CONSENSUS -- TO AN </p><p>EXPANDED ARF CHAIR. </p><p> </p><p>8.   PHUNG SAID THIS ISSUE NEEDS MORE DISCUSSION AMONGST </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS.  IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE EEP GROUP TO </p><p>PERFORM IN-DEPTH STUDIES AND OFFER NON-BINDING PROFESSIONAL </p><p>ADVICE, ALTHOUGH ANY ACTIVITIES WOULD HAVE TO OBSERVE BASIC </p><p>ASEAN PRINCIPLES OF RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGNTY AND NON- </p><p>INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  THE DRAFT PAPER ALSO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00539  02 OF 03  080246Z </p><p>NEEDS TO QUANTIFY FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ARF MEMBERS. </p><p>VIETNAM WOULD LIKE THIS PAPER DISCUSSED AT THE APRIL ASEAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS\' RETREAT. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER ARF ISSUES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   PHUNG COMMNENTED THAT VIETNAM IS WORKING NOW ON THE </p><p>DRAFT CHAIR\'S STATEMENT FOR THE JULY MINISTERIAL, AND WILL </p><p>SEND IT OUT SOON FOR COMMENTS.  VIETNAM PARTICULARLY WANTS </p><p>SUGGESTIONS FROM THE MAJOR ARF PARTNERS, INCLUDING THE U.S., </p><p>FOR THE MINISTERIAL AND BEYOND. </p><p> </p><p>10.  VIETNAM HAS HEARD THE CRITICISM, PHUNG CONTINUED, THAT </p><p>THE ARF IS SLOWING UNDER ITS CHAIRMANSHIP.  ALL ASEAN </p><p>MEMBERS, VIETNAM INCLUDED, AGREE THAT THE ARF IS A SLOW- </p><p>MOVING FORUM.  VIETNAM VERY MUCH WANTS TO LEAVE ITS MARK AS </p><p>ARF CHAIR, BUT IS CONSTRAINED IN PUSHING FORWARD BY THE </p><p>ASEAN TRADITION OF WAITING FOR NEW MEMBERS AND THOSE </p><p>UNPREPARED FOR NEXT STEPS.  FOR THIS REASON, ALTHOUGH </p><p>VIETNAM IS ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT </p><p>STAGE, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES (CBMS) WILL REMAIN THE </p><p>ARF\'S MAIN THRUST FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p> </p><p>11.   IN THIS VEIN, PHUNG BROUGHT UP THE ECONOMIC SECURITY </p><p>SEMINAR INITIATIVE, ON WHICH A PAPER CIRCULATED AT THE SEOUL </p><p>ISG.  VIETNAM WANTS A CO-SPONSOR FOR THIS CBM, AND SOLICITS </p><p>U.S. SUPPORT.  THE MARCH SOM WILL DISCUSS THE TOPIC, AND </p><p>VIETNAM WOULD TENTATIVELY LIKE TO SEE THE SEMINAR HAPPEN AT </p><p>THE END OF 2001.   DAS BOYCE PROMISED U.S. CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>THE IDEA. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00539  02 OF 03  080246Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  BOYCE ASKED FOR PHUNG\'S VIEWS ON DISCUSSIONS OVER THE </p><p>SOUTH CHINA SEA CODE OF CONDUCT, AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE </p><p>ARF COULD WORK.  PHUNG SAID ONLY THAT "DIFFERENCES" REMAIN </p><p>AMONGST THE ASEAN MEMBERS, AND THE GROUP NEEDS TIME TO REACH </p><p>CONSENSUS.  OF POSSIBLE NOTE, PHUNG SAID CHINA HAD PROPOSED </p><p>A CHINA-VIETNAM-MALAYSIA MEETING TO DISCUSS OUTSTANDING </p><p>ISSUES, BUT ASEAN BELIEVES INTERNAL GROUP CONSENSUS IS </p><p>NECESSARY FIRST BEFORE ENGAGING WITH CHINA ON ANY OTHER </p><p>BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>ASEAN POST-MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  PHUNG SAID VIETNAM IS ALSO MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE </p><p>ASEAN PMC, AND IS SOLICITING THE VIEWS OF THE DIALOGUE </p><p>PARTNERS ON HOW TO MANAGE THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE THE ASEAN </p><p>MINISTERS\' MEETING, THE ARF, THE PMC, AND APEC.  QUNG </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE VIEWS OF MAJOR PARTNERS SUCH AS THE U.S. </p><p>ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.  VIETNAM\'S CURRENT VIEW IS THAT </p><p>THE PMC SHOULD FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT, LEAVING POLITICAL AND </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES TO THE ARF. </p><p> </p><p>14.  BOYCE EXPRESSED U.S. RESERVATIONS OVER A CONTINUED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FOCUS IN THE PMC, AS THE LEVEL OF DETAIL </p><p>ENTAILED IS NOT WELL SUITED TO DISCUSSION AT THE MINISTERIAL </p><p>LEVEL AND OTHER MORE APPROPRIATE FORA ALREADY EXIST.  BOYCE </p><p>ALSO RAISED CONTINUED LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON U.S. DEVELOPMENT </p><p>COOPERATION WITH ASEAN, BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY CONCERNS OVER </p><p>BURMA, AND SUGGESTED TOO HARD A FOCUS ON THIS TOPIC COULD </p><p>AFFECT THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE MEETING.  INSTEAD, THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00539  02 OF 03  080246Z </p><p>BELIEVES THE PMC MAY BE A USEFUL VENUE FOR DISCUSSION OF </p><p>TRANSNATIONAL AND EXTRA-REGIONAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  PHUNG UNDERTOOK TO PASS THESE VIEWS ON, AND COMMENTED </p><p>THAT DISCUSSION OF EXTERNAL VIEWS COULD BE USEFUL.  IN THE </p><p>10-PLUS-ONE MEETING IN PARTICULAR, HOWEVER, TIME IS LIMITED, </p><p>AND NEEDS TO BE DEVOTED TO BILATERAL U.S.-ASEAN TIES. </p><p>OVERALL, VIETNAM AND MOST OTHER ASEAN MEMBERS CONTINUE TO </p><p>THINK DEVELOPMENT IS A GOOD TOPIC FOR THE PMC.  PRESSED FOR </p><p>FURTHER DETAIL ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUES VIETNAM PROPOSES FOR </p><p>DISCUSSION, PHUNG OUTLINED THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>     -- OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES AS ASEAN FACES </p><p>GLOBALIZATION, AND HOW TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICES. </p><p> </p><p>     -- NARROWING THE DEVELOPMENT GAP BETWEEN THE ASEAN OLD- </p><p>TIMERS AND NEW-COMERS, AND BETWEEN ASEAN AND OTHER REGIONS. </p><p> </p><p>     -- HOW TO ATTRACT EXPANDED OUTSIDE INVESTMENT AND </p><p>COOPERATION, BOTH BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL, INCLUDING </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PHUNG COMMENTED THAT THE POINT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WOULD </p><p>NOT BE TO REQUEST FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO MUCH AS TO SOLICIT </p><p>IDEAS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  DAS BOYCE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THIS </p><p>MESSAGE BEFORE DEPARTING POST. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00539  03 OF 03  080246Z </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
