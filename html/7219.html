(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador used the opportunity of an </p><p>April 6 meeting with MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan to again urge forward movement on </p><p>the signing of an ICC Article 98 agreement.  Hamdan </p><p>acknowledged the importance of dealing with this </p><p>issue, which had been on the agenda of last year\'s </p><p>inaugural Bilateral Strategic Dialogue.  The </p><p>Ambassador laid out the option of formalizing the </p><p>agreement via an exchange of diplomatic notes, but </p><p>emphasized that this would need to be legally </p><p>binding.  Hamdan promised to look into the matter </p><p>right away. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MFA Deputy Legal Affairs Director Yacoub Al- </p><p>Hosani contacted Polchief on April 7 to report that </p><p>Hamdan had decided to pursue an exchange of dip </p><p>notes.  He assured that this course of action would </p><p>be legally binding.  Polchief faxed over the dip </p><p>note draft language in Arabic and English provided </p><p>by the Department.  Al-Hosani briefed that a </p><p>committee has been formed to review the language; he </p><p>estimated that the UAE would need approximately </p><p>three to four weeks for the review process.  We will </p><p>continue to follow-up with the MFA and report our </p><p>findings to the Department. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
