Threat Assessment for the Netherlands is as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The treat to official Americans in the Netherlands is low. </p><p>There are no specific threats or security restrictions in </p><p>place at this time.  However, all Americans should exercise </p><p>caution while traveling abroad, as U.S. citizens are often </p><p>the target of groups demonstrating opposition to U.S. </p><p>foreign policy.  For the latest worldwide terrorism </p><p>advisories, please consult the State Department web page at </p><p>www.state.gov.  A major concern for visitors is crime.  Most </p><p>crimes against Americans are limited to pick-pocketing, </p><p>burglary, vandalism to automobiles, and theft from hotel </p><p>rooms.  Streets can be walked in relative safety, but the </p><p>same amount of caution should be exercised after dark in the </p><p>more populated cities of The Hague, Amsterdam, and </p><p>Rotterdam, as would be appropriate in any urban city in the </p><p>US City centers, red-light districts, and public </p><p>transportation hubs are common locations for incidents of </p><p>street crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Budget for travel and representational events will </p><p>follow septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
