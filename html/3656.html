<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, SNAR, PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UPDATE ON FATF MONEY LAUNDERING REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 12345 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) Since Ambassador Jeter\'s August 29 meetings with </p><p>President Obasanjo and Presidential Advisors Stephen Oronsaye </p><p>and Obi Ezekwesili, the Government of Nigeria has moved </p><p>quickly in an attempt to repair its bad reputation with the </p><p>Financial Action Task Force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) On August 30 President Obasanjo wrote to FATF </p><p>President Sanio, detailing a number of steps to be taken in </p><p>to coming weeks, including new Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) </p><p>guidelines for reporting by financial institutions and a </p><p>planned visit to the FATF\'s Africa and Middle East Review </p><p>Group (AMERG) in Rome in mid-September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) On August 31, President Obasanjo sent letters to the </p><p>President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of </p><p>Representatives, depicting the dire situation Nigeria is in </p><p>vis-a-vis the FATF and urging the legislature to enact the </p><p>draft Financial Crimes Commission bill introduced in November </p><p>2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) During a September 4 conversation with the </p><p>President\'s Principal Secretary, Stephen Oronsaye, the </p><p>Ambassador warned that the GON might need to explain to the </p><p>FATF\'s AMERG in writing and in advance of any face-to-face </p><p>meeting in Rome, tangible steps the GON has taken or will </p><p>take imminently to address the FATF concerns on Nigeria\'s lax </p><p>money laundering controls.  Without such advance notice of </p><p>tangible progress, the AMERG may turn down a GON request to </p><p>meet in Rome in mid-September, Jeter noted.  Oronsaye took </p><p>this on-board and promised to provide a document to the AMERG </p><p>Chairman in the coming days.   RNLEO delivered the same </p><p>message to the Attorney General on September 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) The Presidency held an inter-agency meeting at the </p><p>Villa the morning of September 5 to produce a strategy for </p><p>resolving the FATF crisis.  It was agreed that Attorney </p><p>General Kanu Agabi would lead a delegation to Rome in </p><p>mid-September, after the Central Bank issues new "circulars" </p><p>or regulations tightening reporting requirements on Nigeria\'s </p><p>banks as well as increasing the threat of penalties for </p><p>failure to abide by these circulars and existing regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) The front page of the September 6 "Punch" (major </p><p>English-language daily) carried the following article under </p><p>the headline, "FG Expresses concern over Financial Crimes:" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo has expressed concern over the </p><p>absence of a commission to handle matters related to </p><p>anti-terrorism, economic and financial crimes in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In separate letters to the Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim </p><p>and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Ghali </p><p>Umar Na\'Abba, dated August 31, Obasanjo reminded the </p><p>legislators that the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force </p><p>(FATF), has threatened to blacklist financial institutions in </p><p>Nigeria by October if nothing was done about financial crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He therefore urged the National Assembly to urgently pass a </p><p>bill for the establishment of a commission on anti-terrorism, </p><p>economic and financial crimes, in the country. The bill was </p><p>sent to the Assembly last November. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The president warned that the country\'s international trade </p><p>and business standing would come to harm if the FATF threat </p><p>was carried out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The letter reads: "The president of the FATF has indicated </p><p>that during its Plenary on 19-21 June 2002, a decision was </p><p>taken to apply counter-measures against Nigeria with effect </p><p>from 31 October 2002 unless we begin substantive </p><p>communications with the FATF and also take significant steps </p><p>to address identified deficiencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"He further indicated that a discussion of the Nigerian </p><p>situation will be given priority during the Group\'s Plenary </p><p>scheduled for 9-11 October 2002, expressing the hope that </p><p>Nigeria would have to take substantive measures to address </p><p>the observed deficiencies and thus avoid the planned </p><p>counter-measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I understand that the planned measures, if taken, would </p><p>render difficult any financial flows to or out of Nigeria </p><p>thereby putting our international trade and business </p><p>transactions at risk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It is for this reason that I urge you and the distinguished </p><p>Senators to give priority consideration to the </p><p>Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Bill </p><p>which I had earlier transmitted to you." </p><p>Obasanjo said that the threat by the FATF is worsened by the </p><p>fact that for a long time, Nigeria did not engage the </p><p>organisation in a dialogue on what was being done to </p><p>strengthen existing legislation or, where necessary, to enact </p><p>new ones to combat financial crimes and related crimes. </p><p>Last week, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said that </p><p>Nigeria was on the list of countries considered by FATF as </p><p>not co-operating in the global war against terrorism, </p><p>financial and economic crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The FATF is used to pressurising various governments to </p><p>ensure that money laundered do not find their way through </p><p>banks.  The international  body has classified Nigeria as a </p><p>non-cooperating country.  The body has given Nigeria till </p><p>October to correct this problem or else we would be in </p><p>serious problem," the CBN said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It warned against opening anonymous accounts for customers. </p><p>"We want the FATF to delist the country from the list of </p><p>uncooperating countries.  The banks have to adhere to the </p><p>rules guiding money transfer," the apex bank stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Comment:  The President and his staff "get it" -- the </p><p>threat of counter-measures from FATF members is very real and </p><p>serious -- and they have responded with alacrity.  Yet months </p><p>of neglect are hard to repair in days and the GON will face a </p><p>tough sell of its defense in Rome, if such a meeting occurs. </p><p>From our contacts with the President, his immediate staff, </p><p>the Attorney General and the Central Bank, we detect a </p><p>sincere and unprecedented, although belated, commitment to </p><p>setting this situation right. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
