<p>S E C R E T ROME 003570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, KN, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREA TELLS ITALY U/S BOLTON SHOULD NOT </p><p>ATTEND SIX-PARTY TALKS </p><p> </p><p>    CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY: DPRK AMBASSADOR TO ITALY CHOE TAEK-SAN </p><p>REQUESTED ITALY SUPPORT NORTH KOREA\'S DEMAND THAT U/S BOLTON </p><p>NOT ATTEND UPCOMING SIX-PARTY TALKS.  HE ALSO MENTIONED NORTH </p><p>KOREA DID NOT CURRENTLY POSSESS A NUCLEAR BOMB, ALTHOUGH </p><p>CONTINUED U.S. AGGRESSION WOULD FORCE IT TO CREATE ONE.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REJECTED HIS REQUEST AND EMPHASIZED NORTH </p><p>KOREA HAD NO NEED FOR A NUCLEAR BOMB.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR EAST ASIA PAOLA MUNZI GAVE </p><p>POLOFF A READOUT AUGUST 5 OF A CONVERSATION WITH NORTH KOREAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR CHOE TAEK-SAN EARLIER IN THE DAY.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POPPED-IN UNEXPECTEDLY TO DISCUSS THE PLANNED SIX-PARTY </p><p>TALKS.  ACCORDING TO MUNZI, THE AMBASSADOR FIRST CREDITED THE </p><p>NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT FOR PROPOSING THE TALKS AND THEIR </p><p>FORMAT, AND THEN REQUESTED ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR NORTH KOREA\'S </p><p>DEMAND THAT U/S BOLTON NOT ATTEND.  AMBASSADOR CHOE EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN OFFENDED BY U/S </p><p>BOLTON\'S RECENT SPEECH IN SEOUL AND COULD NOT BEAR THE </p><p>HUMILIATION IF HE WAS PRESENT AT THE TALKS.  CHOE ALSO TOLD </p><p>MUNZI NORTH KOREA DID NOT YET HAVE A NUCLEAR BOMB, BUT DID </p><p>HAVE MATERIAL AT HAND TO ASSEMBLE ONE AND WOULD FEEL </p><p>OBLIGATED TO DO SO IF THE U.S. CONTINUED TO THREATEN NORTH </p><p>KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) CHOE REPORTEDLY TOLD MUNZI THE DPRK DESIRED A </p><p>DENUCLEARIZED KOREAN PENINSULA, WITH NO AMERICAN STRATEGIC </p><p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN SOUTH KOREA.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED THE U.S. SHOULD REFRAIN FROM CARRYING OUT ANY </p><p>MILITARY EXERCISES OR SENDING ADDITIONAL PLANES TO SOUTH </p><p>    KOREA IN ADVANCE OF THE TALKS, AS MILITARY ACTIONS BY THE </p><p>U.S. COULD PREJUDICE THE OUTCOME.  CHOE THEN REITERATED THAT </p><p>U/S BOLTON\'S PARTICIPATION WOULD ALSO CREATE AN UNFAVORABLE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) MUNZI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE DPRK COULD NOT </p><p>CHOOSE WHO WOULD SIT IN THE U.S. DELEGATION, AS THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD SET THE NEGOTIATING TEAMS.  SHE </p><p>ALSO QUESTIONED THE DPRK\'S NEED FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NOTING </p><p>NORTH KOREA\'S LARGE ARMY PROVIDED ASSURANCE THAT NO ONE WOULD </p><p>ATTACK.  SHOULD ANYONE BE SO FOOLISH AS TO DO SO ANYWAY, DPRK </p><p>ARTILLERY COULD DESTROY SEOUL.  MUNZI SAID AMBASSADOR CHOE </p><p>AVOIDED DISCUSSING THE ARMY AND REITERATED THAT THE DPRK WAS </p><p>VERY WILLING TO NEGOTIATE IF U/S BOLTON WAS NOT AT THE TALKS. </p><p> MUNZI DESCRIBED THE AMBASSADOR AS ALMOST MAKING THE TALKS </p><p>CONTINGENT ON U/S BOLTON\'S (NON)-PARTICIPATION, BUT NEVER </p><p>EXPRESSLY SAYING IT WAS A REDLINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) AMBASSADOR CHOE TOLD MUNZI RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH </p><p>AND NORTH KOREA HAD COOLED RECENTLY, AND THE APPARENT SUICIDE </p><p>OF HYUNDAI HEIR CHUNG MONG-HUN WAS PROBABLY A POLITICALLY </p><p>MOTIVATED MURDER BY ANTI-DPRK FORCES, OR PART OF A LARGER </p><p>POLITICAL PLOT TO IMPEDE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE </p><p>SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) MUNZI TOLD POLOFF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT </p><p>SUPPORT THE NORTH KOREAN REQUEST.  IN AN ASIDE, HOWEVER, SHE </p><p>DID MENTION THAT IF U/S BOLTON DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>PLANNED TALKS, NORTH KOREA COULD NOT CLAIM HIS PRESENCE HAD </p><p>FOILED NEGOTIATIONS AND ATTENTION WOULD FOCUS ON THE NORTH </p><p>KOREAN GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. </p><p>    POLOFF THANKED MUNZI FOR ITALY\'S RESPONSE, NOTED THE NORTH </p><p>KOREAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF NEGOTIATING IN </p><p>GOOD FAITH, AND POINTED OUT THE USG WOULD APPOINT ITS </p><p>DELEGATION AS IT SAW FIT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03570 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
