PolOff conveyed reftel points to Sylvia Corado, Acting </p><p>Director General for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign </p><p>Ministry, on February 19.  Corado agreed that the DPRK\'s </p><p>announced intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the </p><p>Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was worrisome but </p><p>had no official response.  PolOff followed up with Corado on </p><p>February 24 and again on February 28, when Corado candidly </p><p>said that the NPT is not a priority for the GOG.  However, </p><p>Corado said the MFA would look for appropriate opportunities </p><p>to make public statements underlining the importance of the </p><p>NPT, as requested reftel.  Corado was not able to speculate </p><p>about the timing or venue for such statements. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
