FROWICK, REASONS 1.5 (B), </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: EMBASSY OFFICERS MET 2/7 WITH VATICAN NGO </p><p>"CARITAS INTERNATIONAL" CUBA SPECIALISTS FOR A CONVERSATION </p><p>ON CARITAS\' HUMANITARIAN WORK IN CUBA. THE OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>THE ROLE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THEY CLAIMED CARITAS CUBA </p><p>ENJOYED A REASONABLE DEGREE OF FREEDOM AND MAINTAINED A </p><p>COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THEY </p><p>CHALLENGED THE USG TO "ENGAGE" WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>INSTEAD OF ISOLATING IT WITH INEFFECTIVE EMBARGO. THEY </p><p>FORESAW A USEFUL ROLE FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE US IN </p><p>CUBA\'S FUTURE SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AND URGED THE USG TO PLAN NOW FOR THE POST-CASTRO ERA. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>ABOVE POLITICS - JUST MEETING A HUMANITARIAN NEED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C)  EMBASSY OFFICERS MET MARCH 7 WITH CARITAS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CUBA SPECIALIST, FATHER NELSON VIOLA (AN </p><p>ARGENTINE NATIONAL) AND CARITAS CARIBBEAN DESK OFFICER EBER </p><p>FERRER (BRAZILIAN). THEY DISMISSED REFTEL REPORT THAT THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT STEP UP PRESSURE ON THEM BECAUSE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01436  01 OF 03  161439Z </p><p>THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION\'S INITIATIVE FOR FAITH RELIEF </p><p>AGENCIES.  AFTER INSISTING THAT CARITAS WAS NOT "POLITICAL" </p><p>AND ONLY MET A HUMANITARIAN NEED, THEY OFFERED THEIR CANDID </p><p>APPRAISAL OF THE SITUATION IN CUBA. BOTH MEN NOTED HIGH </p><p>STANDARDS OF INTELLECTUAL, CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AMONG CUBANS. HOWEVER, THEY LAMENTED POOR </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, EXCESSIVE STATE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY, AND </p><p>HARD-LINE ATTITUDES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT THAT IMPEDED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  VIOLA CLAIMED CUBA\'S MARKET ECONOMY IS SLOWLY </p><p>DEVELOPING IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS, AND THAT </p><p>THE OVERALL ECONOMY IS BETTER BECAUSE OF TOURISM AND THE </p><p>INFLUX OF HARD CURRENCY REMITTANCES.  HE SAID THE GENERAL </p><p>POPULATION HAD LESS FEAR OF THE STATE AND THAT PLURALISM </p><p>HAD BEGUN TO TAKE HOLD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THEY BOTH CALLED THE U.S. EMBARGO AN ANACHRONISM </p><p>THAT WAS STILL MANIPULATED BY FIDEL CASTRO AS AN EXCUSE FOR </p><p>CUBA\'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WOES.  FR. VIOLA OPINED THAT </p><p>CARITAS WOULD HAVE LESS WORK TO DO IN CUBA IF THE U.S. </p><p>EMBARGO WERE LIFTED, ALTHOUGH THE CHURCH\'S OPPOSITION TO IT </p><p>WAS PRACTICAL, NOT POLITICAL.  HE SAID IT WAS </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLE DURING THE COLD WAR, IF NOT JUSTIFIED, BUT </p><p>THAT NOW THE U.S. IS JUST LOSING BUSINESS TO EUROPEAN </p><p>COMPETITORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  VIOLA SAID CARITAS FUNNELS MOST OF ITS ASSISTANCE </p><p>THROUGH OFFICIAL CUBAN MECHANISMS.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH </p><p>CUBAN OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO HUNGER IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY, CARITAS DISCREETLY RUNS "SOUP KITCHENS," FOR THE </p><p>ELDERLY AND UNMARRIED MOTHERS.  THE GOC DISCOURAGES RELIEF </p><p>THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE SOCIALIST MODEL (WHICH WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01436  01 OF 03  161439Z </p><p>PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO FOOD FOR ALL), BUT TOLERATES THESE </p><p>CARITAS ENTERPRISES.  VIOLA SAID THAT OFTEN THE SOUP </p><p>KITCHENS OPERATE FROM THE RESIDENCE OF A LOCAL CLERGYMAN </p><p>WHO CLOAKS IT AS A GESTURE OF HOSPITALITY TO ALLAY OFFICIAL </p><p>SUSPICIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SITUATION OF CHRISTIANS IMPROVED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA CLAIMS THAT IT HAS TAKEN CUBANS 40 </p><p>YEARS TO WAKE UP TO CASTRO\'S TWO MAIN ERRORS: HIS ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN POLICY AND HIS PROMOTION OF AN ATHEISTIC </p><p>COMMUNISM. VIOLA CLAIMS THAT PUBLIC MANIFESTATION OF </p><p>RELIGION IS BECOMING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND THAT THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH HAS A GROWING INFLUENCE ON CUBAN SOCIETY.  ATTENDING </p><p>CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS SERVICES NO LONGER LEADS INEVITABLY TO </p><p>SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP -- EVEN SOME COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS ARE NOW OPENLY CATHOLIC.  THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN </p><p>BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE GOC IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS AFTER THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL CONTINUES TODAY. </p><p>CARITAS CUBA HAS GROWN FROM A SMALL HAVANA-BASED BRANCH TO </p><p>A PRESENCE IN EVERY PARISH IN 2001. FATHER VIOLA DISMISSED </p><p>CLAIMS THAT THE 1999 PAPAL VISIT HAD COME TO NOTHING IN THE </p><p>END.  HE SAID MANY CHRISTIANS EXPECTED TOO MUCH AT ONCE. </p><p>CHANGE, HE OPINED, TAKES A LONG TIME AND IT WAS AN </p><p>ABSURDITY TO EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE.  THE PAPAL VISIT WAS A </p><p>CATALYST FOR CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>6.

FOR EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE), WHA/CCA, WHA/CAN (NIGRO), </p><p>DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 41/OL </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (TEXT/PARA NUM 11) </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/11 </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KIRF, CU, VT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01436  02 OF 03  161443Z </p><p>SUBJECT: CARITAS INTERNATIONA ON CUBA - "CAUTIOUS </p><p>OPTIMISM" </p><p> </p><p>OTHER CULTURES ERE "CUBAN TRAITS."  HE SPOKE OF AN </p><p>INTERPENETRAION AND DIALECTIC BETWEEN OLDER AND YOUNGER </p><p>BELIVERS.  DESCRIBING MARXISM AS AN INTELLECTUAL </p><p>ABERATION, VIOLA SAID THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS CETRAL </p><p>TO THE INTELLECTUAL AWAKENING OF THE CUBAN POPLE.  HE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED OPPOSITION TO RELIGION AND O THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH TO A "NATURAL SOCIOLOGICALAND PSYCHOLOGICAL </p><p>REACTION" DURING THE REVOLUTIOARY PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>VIOLA, THE CATHOLIC CHRCH HAS RECEIVED HAVANA\'S APPROVAL </p><p>TO OPEN A THIR SEMINARY TO TRAIN FUTURE CLERGY (THERE ARE </p><p>ALREDY TWO IN OPERATION) AND THAT CUBA\'S BISHOPS ARE FEE </p><p>TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY.  THE CHURCHIS CONTENT </p><p>WITH, BT MONITORING CUBA\'S SECULAR EUCATION SYSTEM TO </p><p>GUARD AGAINST THE TEACHING OF ATI-CHRISTIAN THEMES. THE </p><p>CHURCH STILL SEEKS THE REEDOM TO CONDUCT RELIGIOUS </p><p>EDUCATION, BUT AS YE HAS NEITHER THE PERMISSION NOR THE </p><p>FINANCIAL CAACITY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE EDUCATION </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE PRIEST ALSO CLAIMED THAT CUBAN AUTHOITIES </p><p>HAVE NO PROBLEM ABOUT USG FUNDS REACHING IS CITIZENS </p><p>THROUGH DONATIONS TO CARITAS CUBA FRO ITS SISTER AGENCY IN </p><p>THE U.S., CATHOLIC RELIEF ERVICES.  HE SAID CARITAS CUBA </p><p>IS THE ONLY FOREIN NGO REGISTERED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>AS AN AM OF THE CUBAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS CONFERENCE, CARITA </p><p>IS IN AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT FORCES TE CUBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE CHUCH, SOMETHING THAT </p><p>GIVES CARITAS "COVER" ACCORDING TO VIOLA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01436  02 OF 03  161443Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MODELS FOR CHANGE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C)  VIOLA SUGGESTED THAT THE CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF </p><p>MIAMI COULD BECOME A KIND OF CARIBBEAN CENTER FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID OPERATIONS.  ACCORDING TO VIOLA, THIS </p><p>DOVETAILS WITH THE VATICAN\'S "SINGLE AMERICAN CONTINENT" </p><p>POLICY, BUT IT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR CULTURAL, FINANCIAL, </p><p>LOGISTICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS REASONS.  HE BELIEVED THE </p><p>U.S. HAD A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT THE COORDINATION CENTER </p><p>MUT OPERATE ON A DEMOCRATIC MODEL.  ITS WORK WOULD HVE TO </p><p>BE VERY DISCRETE AND ABOVE POLITICAL ISSUE.  HE SAID THE </p><p>ARCHDIOCESE WAS ALREADY WORKING WTH YOUNG CUBAN-AMERICANS </p><p>TO CHANGE ATTITUDES AND OSTER RECONCILIATION.  FATHER </p><p>VIOLA MENTIONED MIAMI ASSISTANT BISHOP THOMAS G. WENSKI </p><p>WAS A KEY FIGURE FOR U.S. CATHOLIC CHURCH EFFORTS IN CUBA </p><p>AND THE CARIBBEAN REGION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA ALSO ENTHUSED OVER A MEDICAL PROJECT </p><p>IN THE DIOCESE OF SANTA CLARA.  SUPPORTED BY THE CUBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND AT ONE STAGE TO HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY A U.S. </p><p>FOUNDATION, THE JOHN PAUL II PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY INSTITUTE </p><p>OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS TO BE A </p><p>CATCHMENT HOSPITAL FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA, AND COULD </p><p>"SERVE EVERYONE\'S INTERESTS."  APPARENTLY A FUNDING HICCUP </p><p>HAS STALLED IT.  VIOLA PROFFERED THE HOSPITAL AS A PROJECT </p><p>IN WHICH THE U.S. COULD BECOME INVOLVED, PERHAPS THROUGH </p><p>THE MEDIATION OF THE MIAMI ARCHDIOCESE, AND SO ENGAGE THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID CUBA WAS RIPE FOR CHANGE AND A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01436  02 OF 03  161443Z </p><p>PROJECT SUCH AS THIS COULD HELP STIMULATE POSITIVE CHANGE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO VIOLA, U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE PROJECT WOULD </p><p>ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, DAMAGED BY </p><p>THE EMBARGO. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>APRES CASTRO LE DELUGE? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA URGED THE USG TO PLAN NOW FOR A </p><p>POST-CASTRO TRANSITION, AT THE SAME TIME INSISTING THAT </p><p>SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE WOULD HAVE GREATEST </p><p>SUCCESS WHILE CASTRO WAS STILL ALIVE.  HE SAID THE </p><p>ATMOSPHERE IN CUBA WAS TENSE, AND THAT THERE WAS A RISK OF </p><p>VIOLENCE WITH THE TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIANISM TO A </p><p>MORE LIBERAL CLIMATE.  THIS WAS AGGRAVATED BY VOCIFEROUS </p><p>HARD-LINERS ON ALL SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  CLEARLY VIOLA WAS CONFIDENT ABOUT THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>FUTURE IN CUBA.  HE EXPLAINED HIS UNVARNISHED CRITICISM OF </p><p>USG POLICY BY SAYING "I ASK A LOT OF HAVANA, BUT I HAVE A </p><p>RIGHT TO ASK EVEN MORE OF YOU."  ALTHOUGH THIS INITIAL </p><p>MEETING WITH A/DCM WAS A RECITATION OF RAMBLING ANALYSES, </p><p>SHIBBOLETHS, AND PLATITUDES, WE BELIEVE VIOLA CAN BE AN </p><p>IMPORTANT LENS INTO CUBAN AFFAIRS SINCE HE TRAVELS </p><p>REGULARLY THROUGHOUT CUBA AND APPEARS WILLING TO SHARE HIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        VATICA  01436  02 OF 03  161443Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6824 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01436  03 OF 03  161446Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------D2D915  161448Z /38 </p><p>R 141648Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO USINT HAVANA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 001436 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.
