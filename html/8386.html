<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 000776 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ARMED FORCES DEPUTY AFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>EU, BUT TAKES SWIPES AT U.S., EU, AND DOMESTIC "OPPONENTS" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Declaring at a globalization conference that </p><p>the Turkish military is not against Turkey\'s pursuit of EU </p><p>membership, deputy chief of the TGS Buyukanit further </p><p>qualified the military\'s stance with a series of reservations </p><p>and an indirect but clear set of jabs at the U.S.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Opening a Turkish Armed Forces-sponsored symposium </p><p>on globalization at the Military Academy in Istanbul on May </p><p>29, Turkish General Staff (TGS) deputy Yasar Buyukanit </p><p>declared that the Turkish Armed Forces cannot be against the </p><p>EU because the EU is the "ultimate condition" for realizing </p><p>Ataturk\'s modernization targets.  He went on to denounce </p><p>claims that the Turkish military opposed European Union </p><p>membership as an "unfair attack."  He called for the EU to </p><p>treat Turkey\'s "40-year old" membership application "without </p><p>any prejudice."  At the same time, Buyukanit denounced past </p><p>foreign support for domestic terrorism (i.e., Kurdish </p><p>separatism) by countries using the guise of "trying to teach </p><p>us human rights."  Buyukanit also warned those with "archaic </p><p>and separatist goals" that EU membership could not be used as </p><p>a means to advance their objectives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In thinly-veiled criticism of the U.S. and Western </p><p>Europe, Buyukanit criticized "developed" and "hegemonic" </p><p>states for not being sensitive to local concerns in pursuing </p><p>policies that "exploit ethnic diversities" and "damage social </p><p>stability" in developing countries.  While condemning </p><p>terrorism, Buyukanit said that "powerful countries" must also </p><p>pursue strategies that are in compliance with international </p><p>law.  Finally, in light of vast income disparities, developed </p><p>countries should be less "stingy" in their approach to </p><p>developing countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Amidst continuing speculation following remarks by NSC </p><p>Secretary-General Kilinc and subsequent remarks by TGS Chief </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ozkok, conference attendees (including many of Turkey\'s most </p><p>prominent columnists, academics, and retired diplomats and </p><p>generals) expected Buyukanit to deliver a message confirming </p><p>the military\'s commitment to Turkey\'s EU membership. </p><p>Although most appeared encouraged by his remarks, some of the </p><p>attendess were unconvinced.  Ilnur Cevik, editor and </p><p>columnist for the English-language Turkish Daily News, </p><p>pointed out to poloff that Buyukanit had given no specifics </p><p>on the necessary steps that the military itself would have to </p><p>take for Turkey to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria.  One </p><p>foreign analyst and long-time Turkey resident was </p><p>particularly struck by the jabs at the U.S.  In remarks to </p><p>Pol Counselor in Ankara, leading commentator Cengiz Candar </p><p>agreed with this latter assessment.  Candar saw Buyukanit as </p><p>using the EU-candidacy-related portion of his remarks (with </p><p>support for EU candidacy couched in negative terms, i.e. the </p><p>Armed Forces "cannot be against") as a mere lead-in to a </p><p>criticism of the U.S. and a warning to domestic groups the </p><p>military judges to be against Ataturkist principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Other columnists also picked up on the negative </p><p>message: Sedat Ergin in centrist mass-circulation "Hurriyet" </p><p>focused on Buyukanit\'s criticism of the U.S. and </p><p>globalization; Himet Bila in Kemalist "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>interpreted the remarks as a warning to the West and a </p><p>defiant statement against those who want to see the Turkish </p><p>military\'s influence wane. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: lack of specifics and swipes at the U.S. and </p><p>EU in Buyukanit\'s remarks have left many questions </p><p>unanswered.  Some of our Istanbul contacts worry that at a </p><p>time when the TGS is making critical decisions about </p><p>senior-level appointments, TGS Chief Ozkok appears to be more </p><p>and more isolated.  Hurriyet columnist Cuneyt Ulsever told </p><p>poloff before the speech that he is worried about divisions </p><p>within the top brass and thinks some anti-EU hard-liners may </p><p>be looking for an "emergency" to justify extending in their </p><p>positions for another year. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
