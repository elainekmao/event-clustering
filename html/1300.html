<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JAKARTA 004700 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, PREF, UNHCR, ID </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY COHEN\'S LUNCH WITH BAMBANG YUDHOYONO </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR GREG FERGIN FOR </p><p>REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  IN A SEPTEMBER 18 LUNCH, INDONESIAN COORDINATING </p><p>MINISTER FOR POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND SECURITY AFFAIRS BAMBANG </p><p>YUDHOYONO TOLD SECRETARY COHEN THAT ON YUDHOYONO\'S MISSION TO NEW </p><p>YORK, HE WILL DESCRIBE IN DETAIL INDONESIA\'S AGENDA FOR DISARMING </p><p>AND DISBANDING THE MILITIAS.  HE SAID INDONESIA WOULD FIRST TRY </p><p>PERSUASIVE METHODS AND THEN "REPRESSIVE" METHODS.  THE GOI HAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED A FIRM TIMETABLE FOR DISARMAMENT; POLICE, BACKED UP BY </p><p>THE MILITARY, WILL TAKE COERCIVE MEASURES IF THE MILITIAS DO NOT </p><p>TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS FROM SEPTEMBER 22-24.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT </p><p>SIX SUSPECTS IN THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND THAT </p><p>OTHER ARRESTS, INCLUDING OF NOTORIOUS MILITIA LEADER EURICO </p><p>GUTERRES, ARE IMMINENT.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE FACES PRESSURE </p><p>FROM ULTRA-NATIONALIST FORCES WITHIN INDONESIAN SOCIETY AND IN THE </p><p>INDONESIAN CABINET.  HE SAID THAT MANY INDONESIANS MISUNDERSTAND </p><p>THE UNSC RESOLUTION AND MISREAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AS A THREAT </p><p>TO INDONESIAN SOVEREIGNTY.  HE SAID DELAYING THE UNSC MISSION </p><p>WOULD HELP DISARM NATIONALIST CRITICS.  HE ALSO URGED COHEN TO </p><p>ALLAY NATIONALIST CONCERNS BY INCLUDING A STRONG STATEMENT OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY IN HIS PRESS </p><p>STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED.  SECRETARY COHEN TOLD YUDHOYONO THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXPECTS QUICK RESULTS ON DISARMING AND </p><p>DISBANDING THE TIMOR MILITIAS AND ON PROSECUTING THOSE RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE MURDERS OF UN PEACEKEEPERS AND THE ATAMBUA MASSACRE OF </p><p>UNHCR STAFF.  COHEN SAID WHEN SENIOR INDONESIAN OFFICIALS DENY </p><p>INDONESIA\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATAMBUA MURDERS OR EVEN BLAME </p><p>FOREIGNERS FOR THE KILLINGS, IT HURTS INDONESIA\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>IMAGE.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS READY TO SUPPORT INDONESIA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS AT MILITARY REFORM, BUT THAT EVENTS OVER THE PAST SIX </p><p>MONTHS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO REESTABLISH MILITARY-MILITARY </p><p>TIES.  COHEN SAID THE "WORLD IS LOOKING AT INDONESIA THROUGH THE </p><p>LENS OF TIMOR," AND URGED YUDHOYONO TO TAKE SWIFT MEASURES, </p><p>INCLUDING ACTION AGAINST EX-INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL </p><p>ACTIVE IN TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THE MILITIAS.  STRONG MEASURES </p><p>WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE </p><p>INDONESIAN MILITARY IS READY TO TAKE A RESPONSIBLE ROLE IN </p><p>INDONESIAN SOCIETY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ON SEPTEMBER 18, SECRETARY COHEN AND AMBASSADOR GELBARD MET </p><p>OVER LUNCH WITH INDONESIAN COORDINATING MINISTER FOR POLITICAL, </p><p>SOCIAL, AND SECURITY AFFAIRS BAMBANG YUDHOYONO.  CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>FOR TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS LT. GENERAL AGUS WIDJOYO, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES BODNER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF </p><p>DEFENSE KENNETH BACON, AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>SKIP BOYCE ALSO ATTENDED THE LUNCH. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>YUDHOYONO: GOI PLANS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT ON HIS MISSION TO NEW YORK HE WOULD </p><p>EXPLAIN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WEST TIMOR, CONVEY THE GOI\'S </p><p>RESPONSE TO UNSC RESOLUTION 1319, DESCRIBE THE GOI\'S PLAN OF </p><p>ACTION FOR DISBANDING AND DISARMING THE MILITIAS AND THE </p><p>PROSECUTION OF THOSE GUILTY OF CRIMES, AND DISCUSS HOW THE GOI CAN </p><p>WORK WITH UNTAET ON REPATRIATION OF TIMOR IDPS.  YUDHOYONO SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOI WOULD FIRST TAKE A "PERSUASIVE APPROACH" IN DISARMING </p><p>THE MILITIAS.  YUDHOYONO HAD MET ON SEPTEMBER 14 WITH MILITIA </p><p>LEADERS AS PART OF THAT PERSUASIVE APPROACH AND THE MILITIA </p><p>LEADERS HAD PROMISED TO TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS.  YUDHOYONO FEELS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THE MILITIAS WILL DISARM VOLUNTARILY, BUT THE GOI </p><p>HAS SET A STRICT TIMETABLE FOR COMPLIANCE.  IF THE MILITIAS DO NOT </p><p>TURN OVER THEIR WEAPONS DURING THE THREE-DAY PERIOD SEPTEMBER 22- </p><p>24, THE INDONESIAN POLICE, BACKED UP BY THE MILITARY, WILL </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE "REPRESSIVE" PHASE OF DISARMING THE MILITIAS. </p><p>YUDHOYONO SAID THAT A PERIOD OF MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP WILL ALSO </p><p>BE REQUIRED BECAUSE THE MILITIAS MAY HAVE MANY HIDDEN CACHES OF </p><p>ARMS.  HE SAID THAT DISARMING THE MILITIAS WOULD BE A LONG </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ARRESTS PROCEEDING </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>KILLINGS AT ATAMBUA IS PROCEEDING.  SIX SUSPECTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS.  OTHER ARRESTS, </p><p>IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS, ARE IMMINENT. </p><p>YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT NOTORIOUS MILITIA LEADER </p><p>EURICO GUTERRES WOULD SOON BE ARRESTED, THOUGH NOT ON CHARGES </p><p>RELATED TO THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS.  SECRETARY COHEN AND AMBASSADOR </p><p>GELBARD REVIEWED THE EVIDENCE PLACING GUTERRES AT ATAMBUA ON THE </p><p>DAY OF THE KILLINGS.  YUDHOYONO INITIALLY SAID THAT EURICO MIGHT </p><p>HAVE BEEN IN WEST TIMOR BECAUSE OF THE DEATH THE PREVIOUS DAY OF </p><p>MILITIA LEADER OLIVIO MORUK.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>SIX-HOUR TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN KUPANG AND ATAMBUA MEANT THAT </p><p>GUTERRES MUST HAVE DEPARTED BY 5:30 A.M. TO ARRIVE IN ATAMBUA. </p><p>THIS WAS EVIDENCE OF GUTERRES\'S PREMEDITATED MALICE.  YUDHOYONO </p><p>FINALLY SAID THAT THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO BUILD A CASE TO LINK </p><p>GUTERRES DIRECTLY TO THE CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>NATIONALIST PRESSURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT, AS IN ANY DEVELOPING COUNTRY, THERE </p><p>ARE "ULTRA-NATIONALIST" ELEMENTS IN SOCIETY AND IN THE CABINET. </p><p>HE SAID THAT HE ADVOCATES WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>AND FACING UP TO INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS, BUT FACES STRONG PRESSURE </p><p>FROM THE NATIONALISTS.  MANY INDONESIANS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND OFFICIALS MISREAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERN OVER TIMOR </p><p>AND OTHER TOPICS AS A THREAT TO INDONESIAN SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p>NATIONALISM HAD CAUSED CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE FOR YUDHOYONO </p><p>PERSONALLY.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE HAD PREVIOUSLY TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>FLAK FOR ADVOCATING A POLICY OF COOPERATION WITH INTERFET. </p><p>SIMILARLY, RESISTANCE FROM OLDER OFFICERS IN THE MILITARY HAD </p><p>STYMIED YUDHOYONO\'S BLUEPRINT FOR MILITARY REFORM, WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>AGREED UPON TWO YEARS AGO.  HE ASKED FOR U.S. SUPPORT AND PATIENCE </p><p>OVER THE LONG TERM. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>UNSC MISSION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT INDONESIANS, AND SPECIFICALLY </p><p>"ULTRANATIONALISTS," MISUNDERSTAND THE UN THESE INDONESIANS EQUATE </p><p>ANYTHING RELATED TO THE UN WITH UN PEACEKEEPING OR A UN TRIBUNAL. </p><p>SUCH SENTIMENTS HAD LED TO INDONESIAN RESISTANCE TO THE UNSC </p><p>MISSION ON WEST TIMOR.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT THE MISSION WOULD BEST </p><p>BE DELAYED SO THAT IT COULD CONFIRM INDONESIAN PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>WEST TIMOR CRISIS RATHER THAN COME UP WITH "A NEW PACKAGE" ON WEST </p><p>TIMOR.  RESISTANCE TO THE MISSION, HE SAID, MIGHT BE OVERCOME </p><p>MERELY BY CHANGING THE TIMING.  IN RESPONSE, AMBASSADOR GELBARD </p><p>NOTED THAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE KILLINGS AND IN </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF CONCRETE ACTIONS, FURTHER DELAY WAS INCREASINGLY </p><p>DIFFICULT.  YUDHOYONO ALSO SAID THAT A DELEGATION OF "BLUE BERETS" </p><p>MIGHT BE LESS INFLAMMATORY TO NATIONALIST PASSIONS THAN A UNSC </p><p>MISSION.  (NOTE: YUDHOYONO\'S REFERENCE TO "BLUE BERETS" PROBABLY </p><p>MEANT UN MILITARY OBSERVERS.)  THE SECRETARY AND THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REBUTTED THAT IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A GROUP OF SIX DIPLOMATS </p><p>WOULD BE PERCEIVED AS MORE THREATENING THAN A MILITARY DELEGATION. </p><p>MOREOVER, THERE WAS A PRECEDENT FOR THE MISSION IN LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>UNSC MISSION.  FINALLY, INACCURATE, AND PICAYUNE, INDONESIAN </p><p>CRITICISM OVER THE DATES LISTED IN THE UNSC RESOLUTION WAS NOT </p><p>BECOMING EITHER. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>COHEN: WORLD WAITING FOR ACTION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) SECRETARY COHEN SAID THAT WEST TIMOR WAS THE MAIN TOPIC OF </p><p>DISCUSSION DURING HIS ENTIRE VISIT.  THE U.S. AND THE ENTIRE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXPECT THE GOI TO TAKE SWIFT, STRONG </p><p>ACTION TO DISBAND AND DISARM THE MILITIAS AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE </p><p>THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLINGS OF UN PEACEKEEPERS AND FOR THE </p><p>ATAMBUA MASSACRE.  HE SAID THAT WHEN SENIOR INDONESIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>PUBLICLY DISPUTE INDONESIAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEMS IN </p><p>WEST TIMOR AND EVEN BLAME THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS ON FOREIGNERS (AS </p><p>HAD BEEN STATED MORE THAN ONCE BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER), IT WAS </p><p>NOT HELPFUL TO INDONESIA\'S IMAGE.  SECRETARY COHEN HAD ALSO BEEN </p><p>DISAPPOINTED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER\'S STATEMENT THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>WAS NOT ABLE TO DISARM THE MILITIAS.  SUCH STATEMENTS INDICATE </p><p>THAT INDONESIA IS NOT FACING UP TO ITS OBLIGATION TO SOLVE THE </p><p>PROBLEMS IN WEST TIMOR.  AMBASSADOR GELBARD SAID THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, HAVING PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED GUARANTEES OF </p><p>THE UNHCR WORKERS\' SAFETY, WAS NOW ADAMANT THAT INDONESIA DO MORE </p><p>THAN MAKE COMMITMENTS, BUT TAKE REAL ACTION.  COHEN SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO MOVE AGAINST THE EX-MILITARY </p><p>WHO TRAIN AND EQUIP THE MILITIAS.  WHEN YUDHOYONO EQUIVOCATED OVER </p><p>POSSIBLE EX-MILITARY INVOLVEMENT, AMBASSADOR GELBARD SAID THERE IS </p><p>SOLID EVIDENCE THAT THE MILITIAS HAVE RECEIVED SMALL-UNIT TRAINING </p><p>AND NEW ARMS AND MATERIEL FROM MILITARY SOURCES. YUDHOYONO SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD ASKED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THAT THE REGIONAL </p><p>MILITARY COMMAND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF EX-MILITARY OFFICERS\' </p><p>INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MILITARY TIES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) YUDHOYONO DESCRIBED HOW INDONESIA WANTS TO MOVE TOWARD A </p><p>MORE PROFESSIONAL AND EFFECTIVE MILITARY.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. ESTABLISH BETTER MILITARY TO MILITARY TIES TO ASSIST </p><p>INDONESIA\'S EFFORTS.  COHEN SAID THAT THE U.S. LOOKED FORWARD TO </p><p>THE TIME WHEN CONDITIONS ALLOW THE REESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY TO </p><p>MILITARY TIES.  COHEN SAID THAT PERSONALLY HE GENERALLY ADVOCATES </p><p>IMET AND OTHER MILITARY TIES; HOWEVER, CONTINUING CONCERNS OVER </p><p>TIMOR IN PARTICULAR HAVE KEPT STRICT CONGRESSIONAL PROHIBITIONS </p><p>SOLIDLY IN PLACE.  HE NOTED THAT THE USG HAD PROVIDED C-130 PARTS </p><p>AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL.  UNFORTUNATELY, DETERIORATING EVENTS </p><p>OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAVE NOW UNDERMINED PROGRESS AT </p><p>REESTABLISHING MILITARY TIES.  SECURITY IN TIMOR WAS BETTER A YEAR </p><p>AGO, HE SAID.  WHEN TIES ARE GRADUALLY REESTABLISHED, THE U.S. </p><p>WILL CONCENTRATE FIRST ON THE NAVY, AIR FORCE, AND MARINES BEFORE </p><p>MOVING TO THE ARMY, WHERE REFORM EFFORTS HAVE LAGGED.  YUDHOYONO </p><p>SAID THAT HE ALWAYS PREFERS FRANK DIALOGUE AND DIALOGUE.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HE FOUND THE SECRETARY\'S AND AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS STRONG </p><p>BUT USEFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE FRANKLY STATED. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>NEED A SIGNAL </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COHEN SUMMED UP BY SAYING THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE LOOKING TO INDONESIA TO SEND A SIGNAL.  IF ACTION </p><p>IS TAKEN IN A SHORT TIME TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS IT WILL </p><p>SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT THE MILITARY IS READY TO PLAY A MORE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN INDONESIA AND THAT INDONESIA IS READY TO PLAY </p><p>A MORE POSITIVE INTERNATIONAL ROLE.  FAIRLY OR NOT, COHEN SAID, </p><p>"THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT INDONESIA THROUGH THE LENS OF EAST </p><p>TIMOR."  THE U.S. HAS A SELFISH INTEREST IN PROMOTING THE </p><p>STABILITY AND PROSPERITY OF A UNIFIED INDONESIA, WHICH WOULD HAVE </p><p>A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE REGION.  COHEN CALLED ON THE GOI </p><p>TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ALLOW THE U.S. TO HELP INDONESIA. </p><p>A STRONG INDONESIA IS EVERYONE\'S GOAL, HE SAID </p><p> </p><p>GELBARD </p><p></p></div>
