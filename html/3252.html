<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 07/03/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, XY, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECOWAS REPORT WILL NOT CONTAIN FALSE </p><p>ACCUSATIONS ABOUT THE US AND UK </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 126028 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a July 3 meeting, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>raised reftel points with ECOWAS Acting Executive </p><p>Secretary (Deputy Executive Secretary for Economic </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Integration) Mame Sen, and Colonel Dixon Dikio, </p><p>Military Advisor to the Executive Secretary. Both </p><p>Executive Secretary Chambas and Deputy Executive </p><p>Secretary for Political Affairs Diarra had left </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Nigeria and were in route to Durban for the OAU/AU </p><p>Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Sen expressed surprise at the allegations of </p><p>collusion with the LURD. He had not seen the actual </p><p>report but received an oral briefing from the ECOWAS </p><p>Representative in Monrovia and these allegations were </p><p>not mentioned during the briefing. The more informed </p><p>Dikio acknowledged the field report from the </p><p>assessment team that visited Monrovia mentioned "it </p><p>was possible that Guinea, the UK and US were </p><p>supporting the LURD." However, Dikio assured us that </p><p>this charge was not contained in the condensed report </p><p>the Secretariat prepared and sent to ECOWAS Chairman, </p><p>Senegalese President Wade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dikio explained that the assessment team\'s </p><p>mandate was to collect information from various </p><p>sources in Liberia and make a comprehensive report to </p><p>the Secretariat. The team interviewed a wide range of </p><p>contacts including GOL officials, opposition leaders, </p><p>religious leaders, members of civil society groups, </p><p>etc. While the team was to gather information, the </p><p>Secretariat\'s role was to weigh the credibility of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>information before submission to the Heads of State. </p><p>Thus, the subject allegations never reflected the </p><p>views of the ECOWAS Secretariat, he stressed; instead, </p><p>in reporting the allegations the team was reporting </p><p>what it had heard while in Liberia.  Dikio stated that </p><p>both Chambas and he recognized the import and </p><p>sensitivity of the accusations. Moreover, since the </p><p>field report did not cite any corroborating evidence </p><p>or attribute the allegations to a credible source, </p><p>they gave the charges little weight and decided to </p><p>expunge them from the Secretariat\'s final report. </p><p>However, just to be sure, Chambas raised the issue </p><p>with the UK Deputy High Commissioner. Once Chambas </p><p>heard the UK\'s denial, he was convinced the </p><p>allegations should be excised from the report. </p><p>Convinced by the UK denial, Chambas saw no reason to </p><p>raise this with the US, Dikio recalled. Dikio assured </p><p>the Ambassador that ECOWAS would never allow such a </p><p>serious allegation to pass, given the close </p><p>relationship that exits between ECOWAS and the Embassy </p><p>and the close personal relationship between the </p><p>Executive Secretary and the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Promotion of better relations between the Mano </p><p>River States was another reason the allegations did </p><p>not survive the editing process. Dikio mentioned that </p><p>Guinean and Sierra Leonean diplomats in Monrovia </p><p>stated that relations with the GOL were improving and </p><p>underscored that care must be taken not to rock the </p><p>boat. Dikio stated that even President Taylor had </p><p>remarked to the assessment team about an upswing in </p><p>the bilateral relationship with Guinea.  To preserve </p><p>and nurture this trend, the Secretariat felt it would </p><p>be better not to pass to ECOWAS Heads of State </p><p>unsubstantiated allegations about Guinea being a </p><p>conduit of support to the LURD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
