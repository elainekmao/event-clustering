<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>BANGKOK FOR FAS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA: WHO WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR FREEING RICE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 448 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GOB\'s official announcement of its rice </p><p>liberalization policy answered the questions: who, what, </p><p>where, and when.  However, why, how, and how much are still </p><p>vague.  Until these questions are answered, the success of </p><p>the new policy will be uncertain.  However, we are encouraged </p><p>by the direction the government seems to be taking in the </p><p>agricultural sector, and hope that it will continue.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Unfunded Mandates </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The details of the government\'s new rice policy, </p><p>announced officially on April 24, were largely as reported in </p><p>reftel.  However, there are four key areas left unaddressed </p><p>or vague in the regime\'s announcement.  First and foremost is </p><p>the question of funding for the new reform policy.  The </p><p>government avows that it will no longer force farmers to sell </p><p>in advance, at prices well below the market, a certain number </p><p>of baskets of paddy.  Instead, the GOB will procure from </p><p>merchants at their "purchase price" whatever milled rice (or </p><p>unmilled paddy) it needs for supplementing the incomes of </p><p>civil servants and the military.  Ministry of Agriculture and </p><p>Irrigation (MOAI) officials tell us that the GOB, through the </p><p>newly formed "Myanmar Rice Trading Steering Committee," will </p><p>play a role in setting this "purchase price" though it will </p><p>be market-driven. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) It is unclear how the regime will finance these new, </p><p>more expensive purchases.  Even if the government buys </p><p>cheaper paddy from merchants, the Ministry of Commerce\'s </p><p>Myanmar Agriculture Produce and Trading (MAPT) company could </p><p>face procurement costs as much as 40 billion kyat (roughly </p><p>$40 million) higher than last year.  In the government\'s </p><p>recently published budget, there is no increase reflected in </p><p>expected expenditures for the Ministry of Commerce or MAPT. </p><p>However, supplementary appropriations are legal and routine, </p><p>and deficits, including the deficits of state economic </p><p>enterprises like MAPT, are funded automatically by the </p><p>Central Bank.  In short, if all else fails, there is always </p><p>the printing press. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A high-ranking MOAI official agreed that MAPT would </p><p>be on the hook for much larger procurement expenses than </p><p>before, and that this issue would have to be monitored </p><p>closely.  However, he pointed out that expanded production in </p><p>the long run should drive down domestic prices, and thus </p><p>MAPT\'s expenses.  Also, under the policy proposal the </p><p>government is set to benefit richly from expected increases </p><p>in rice exports.  The government already nets 10 percent from </p><p>a tax on all exports, a practice that will continue. </p><p>However, in this new export regime, traders will have to turn </p><p>over 50 percent of after-tax foreign exchange earnings to the </p><p>government, in exchange for 50 percent of the trader\'s </p><p>documented kyat expenses, plus some "acceptable," but yet </p><p>undetermined, profit margin. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) There is also the possibility that the government </p><p>may choose to cover the cost of the new policy with new </p><p>taxes, particularly on agriculture.  Up to now, the only </p><p>significant taxes farmers paid in Burma were those implicit </p><p>taxes applied through government procurement at below market </p><p>prices.  With that procurement now ended, farmers should be </p><p>fair game for new and more efficient taxes, particularly </p><p>taxes on land.  Part of the proceeds from these taxes could </p><p>be applied, if the government sees fit, to the cost of a rice </p><p>subsidy. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Another option would be for the government to cut </p><p>its rice subsidies to government employees (about 80 million </p><p>baskets per year) and/or replace it with a salary increase. </p><p>Rumors of such an increase have been floating around for </p><p>several months.  However, this raise did not materialize with </p><p>the commencement of the new fiscal year (April 1), and there </p><p>is no hint from the budget numbers that such a huge increase </p><p>in spending is in the cards.  Absolute cuts in the rice </p><p>subsidy, meanwhile, are possible, but would be politically </p><p>unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>No Credit, No Education, No Problem! </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The serious question of credit was also not </p><p>addressed in the GOB\'s policy proclamation.  Starting this </p><p>monsoon crop cycle (June), farmers will not receive the </p><p>advance procurement payments from MAPT that, while small, </p><p>were the main source of credit for purchasing fertilizer, </p><p>seeds, diesel fuel, and other inputs.  According to the MOAI </p><p>official, this issue has not been resolved.  The banking </p><p>sector will be little help, with private banks under water </p><p>and the state-owned Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank </p><p>lending a maximum of 5,000 kyat ($5) per acre.  MOAI and rice </p><p>merchants forecast that farmers will muddle through by taking </p><p>loans, at high interest rates, from the large informal </p><p>financial sector and, ironically, by making advanced sales to </p><p>consortia of rice merchants and to MAPT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Similarly, the question of needed technology and </p><p>education was left unresolved.  A Union of Myanmar Federation </p><p>of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) official told </p><p>us that his organization was working with FAO to establish </p><p>some small training seminars for entrepreneurs and possible </p><p>fact-finding trips to the newly liberalized rice markets of </p><p>Vietnam and Cambodia.  However, he complained that the regime </p><p>had made no mention of any new training programs or education </p><p>above the existing, inadequate agricultural extension and </p><p>research programs.  The MOAI Director General for Planning </p><p>admitted that there had been no new money extended for </p><p>training and education in the recent Ministry budget despite </p><p>his division\'s regular requests.  However, his division and </p><p>the Ministry were working informally to get whatever </p><p>technical advice it could from Japan, South Korea, and from </p><p>Burma\'s ASEAN neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>Why Now? </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Perhaps only Than Shwe\'s astrologer knows for sure </p><p>why the SPDC chose to introduce such a major new initiative </p><p>just before planting began.  We believe the new policy had </p><p>been building momentum for some time, influenced by intense </p><p>lobbying from the UMFCCI and the MOAI, and a number of other </p><p>factors.  First, domestic pressure on the government due to </p><p>record high rice prices was making rice a political hot </p><p>potato.  The transfer of responsibility to the private sector </p><p>will give the GOB a scapegoat should the price of rice </p><p>continue its upward climb.  Second, SPDC Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe was reportedly much impressed during his recent visit to </p><p>Vietnam by that country\'s success in liberalizing its rice </p><p>exports, adding to the regime\'s comfort level in privatizing </p><p>its own rice market.  Leaders here often return from abroad </p><p>with "good ideas" that are announced and implemented with </p><p>unusual alacrity. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Another factor that cannot be ignored is the </p><p>influence of the work Japanese economic experts have been </p><p>doing with their Burmese counterparts to put together a </p><p>comprehensive economic structural reform roadmap.  High on </p><p>the list of priorities is the need for agricultural reform, </p><p>particularly of the rice sector.  According to a MOAI </p><p>official, this advice had significant resonance among some </p><p>Burmese government officials.  The Japanese ambassador to </p><p>Burma agreed with this assessment, telling the COM recently </p><p>that he thought Japan\'s agricultural recommendations had had </p><p>a definite impact on the GOB\'s decision to open the rice </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p>Rice Liberalizations Good, But Not Enough </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Traders are also questioning their ability to buy </p><p>and sell on a country-wide basis.  Right now, military </p><p>commanders in the countryside are under orders to maintain </p><p>local self-sufficiency, and have powers to block trade across </p><p>district lines if that self-sufficiency is threatened.  As a </p><p>result, in late April in northern Shan state, the regional </p><p>commander was posting signs forbidding any transfers of rice </p><p>between districts in southern Kachin and northern Shan </p><p>states, even as the new rice liberalization measures were </p><p>being announced.  If the new rice marketing policies are to </p><p>work properly, the government will have to not only free the </p><p>trade, as it has, but also unify the market by curtailing the </p><p>powers military commanders now have to limit commerce.  If </p><p>that is not done, the free market policies will have, at </p><p>most, only localized effects. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Likewise, rice liberalization cannot succeed in an </p><p>economic policy vacuum.  Without complementary reforms (such </p><p>as a reduction of price inflation and re-establishment of </p><p>some functioning formal financial system), farmers and </p><p>merchants will not be able to take full advantage of the </p><p>benefits of a free rice market. </p><p> </p><p>Only the Beginning? </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) It\'s hard to know at this early stage whether rice </p><p>liberalization is the vanguard of a host of agricultural </p><p>reforms or just an isolated action.  Businessmen, rice </p><p>merchants, foreign diplomats, and government officials are </p><p>all in the dark.  We can hope, though, that the move on rice </p><p>will give courage to those in the private sector and various </p><p>ministries who have been pushing for fundamental agricultural </p><p>and economic reform measures.  MOAI officials have told us </p><p>they are going to push for a reform of the agriculture </p><p>taxation system as soon as possible.  The Japanese government </p><p>is trying to further bolster economic reformers by outlining </p><p>clear objectives and strategies.  We too can assist by </p><p>providing examples of U.S. "best practices" and offering </p><p>whatever we can to the anemic, but burgeoning, private </p><p>agricultural sector. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
