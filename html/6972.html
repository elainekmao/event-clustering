THE ITALIAN ECONOMY ADDED 315,000 JOBS IN THE FORMAL </p><p>SECTOR IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 1.5 PERCENT, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL STATISTIC INSTITUTE\'S ANNUAL SURVEY.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>ECONOMY ADDED FEWER JOBS THAN IN EITHER OF THE TWO PRECEDING </p><p>YEARS, THE MODEST GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT NONETHELESS EXCEEDED </p><p>THE MINIMAL 0.4 PERCENT GROWTH IN GDP.  PAYROLL EMPLOYMENT </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR ALL OF THE GROWTH; THE NUMBER OF SELF-EMPLOYED </p><p>ITALIANS DECLINED SLIGHTLY (BY 18,000).  SLIGHTLY OVER ONE- </p><p>THIRD OF THE NEW POSITIONS, OR 115,000, WERE PART-TIME OR </p><p>FIXED-TERM.   EMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN GREW AT 2.2%; OVER HALF </p><p>THE NEW JOBS CREATED WENT TO WOMEN.  REGIONALLY, GROWTH IN </p><p>EMPLOYMENT WAS STRONGEST IN THE CHRONICALLY UNDERDEVELOPED </p><p>SOUTHERN REGION (1.9 PERCENT), FOLLOWED BY THE CENTER (1.8 </p><p>PERCENT) AND NORTH (1.1 PERCENT), ALTHOUGH NORTHERN ITALY </p><p>CREATED THE MOST JOBS (123,000) OF THE THREE REGIONS. </p><p>TRADITIONALLY LARGE REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>CONTINUED: THE ANNUAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN NORTHERN ITALY </p><p>WAS 4 PERCENT; IN CENTRAL ITALY, 6.6 PERCENT; AND IN </p><p>SOUTHERN ITALY, 18.3 PERCENT.  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY TOOK CREDIT FOR THE MODEST GOOD NEWS AND </p><p>CITED THE ENORMOUS REGIONAL DISPARITIES AS FURTHER EVIDENCE </p><p>OF THE NEED FOR RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS PACKAGE OF LABOR </p><p>MARKET REFORMS (APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT, PENDING </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION REGULATIONS BY THE LABOR MINISTRY - SEE REF </p><p>A). </p><p> </p><p>STRIKE TOTALS SKYROCKETED IN 2002, LARGELY FOR POLITICAL </p><p>REASONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. ITALIAN WORKERS SPENT OVER 4 MILLION MAN-DAYS ON STRIKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01360  01 OF 03  311336Z </p><p>IN 2002, A 355-PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE PRECEDING YEAR, </p><p>ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE ISTAT.  ROUGHLY </p><p>32.7 MILLION MAN-HOURS WERE LOST TO STRIKES, UP FROM 7.2 </p><p>MILLION MAN-HOURS IN 2001.  OVER 85 PERCENT OF THE LOST TIME </p><p>- SOME 27.5 MILLION MAN-HOURS - STEMMED FROM STRIKES CALLED </p><p>FOR MOTIVES UNRELATED TO BARGAINING OR OTHER ELEMENTS OF </p><p>LABOR RELATIONS.  IN 2001, ISTAT REGISTERED ONLY 144,000 MAN- </p><p>HOURS LOST TO STRIKES FOR REASONS OTHER THAN LABOR </p><p>RELATIONS.  THE HUGE INCREASE REFLECTS PRIMARILY DECISIONS </p><p>BY THE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS (ESPECIALLY CGIL, THE </p><p>LARGEST AND MOST LEFT-LEANING POLITICALLY) TO CALL SEVERAL </p><p>NATIONAL STRIKES TO PROTEST BROAD GOVERNMENT POLICY.  OF </p><p>THOSE HOURS LOST TO STRIKES UNDERTAKEN FOR TRADITIONAL LABOR </p><p>MOTIVES, OVER SIXTY PERCENT WERE CONCENTRATED IN THREE </p><p>SECTORS: METALWORKERS (1.8 MILLION MAN-HOURS, OR 34.8 </p><p>PERCENT); PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES </p><p>(833,000 MAN-HOURS, OR 16 PERCENT); AND TRANSPORT AND </p><p>TELECOM (532,000 MAN-HOURS, OR 10.2 PERCENT). </p><p> </p><p>ITALIAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM NOT MEETING WORKFORCE NEEDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE PHENOMENON IS THE RESULT OF BOTH </p><p>ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS, NOTABLY HISTORICALLY POOR </p><p>INTEGRATION OF THE LABOR MARKET WITH EDUCATION AND TRAINING </p><p>SYSTEMS.  ITALY\'S CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS LARGELY THE </p><p>PRODUCT OF 1920\'S, FASCIST-ERA LEGISLATION, CONCENTRATING ON </p><p>CLASSICAL CORE CURRICULA THAT PROVIDES EXCELLENT PREPARATION </p><p>FOR THOSE HEADED TO UNIVERSITY BUT DOES NOT PREPARE OTHER </p><p>STUDENTS FOR THE TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE </p><p>IN AN ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL AND INFORMATION ECONOMY. </p><p>INCREMENTAL REFORMS IN RECENT YEARS FAILED TO CORRECT THIS </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS; A RECENT EDUCATION REFORM PACKAGE MAY </p><p>DO BETTER (SEE LAST ITEM). </p><p> </p><p>6. ITALY WAS ALSO LATE IN DEVELOPING A TRAINING SYSTEM FOR </p><p>UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND IN ADOPTING THE "LIFE-LONG LEARNING" </p><p>CONCEPT.  PROGRAMS IN BOTH AREAS DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE EU </p><p>STARTED CO-FINANCING PROGRAMS IN THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES </p><p>DEVOTED TO REDUCING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.  EVEN AFTER THESE </p><p>NEW INITIATIVES, TRAINING AGENCIES HAD LIMITED CAPABILITIES </p><p>TO EVALUATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN MATCHING POTENTIAL </p><p>EMPLOYEES TO THE LABOR MARKET DEMANDS; PUBLIC/GOVERNMENT </p><p>EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WERE PRIMARILY BUREAUCRATIC OPERATIONS </p><p>CERTIFYING EMPLOYMENT OR UNEMPLOYMENT STATUS.  PUBLIC </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE VIEWED LARGELY AS AVOCATIONAL, </p><p>ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE PERSONAL INCLINATIONS, RATHER </p><p>THAN AS STRATEGIC TOOLS TO ADDRESS EMPLOYERS\' REQUIREMENTS </p><p>FOR WORKERS WITH SPECIFIC SKILLS OR EXPERTISE.  THE RESULT </p><p>HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE MISMATCH BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF </p><p>WORKERS.  UNEMPLOYED ITALIANS OFTEN SPEND TWO TO THREE YEARS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01360  02 OF 03  311337Z </p><p>LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR EDUCATION AND </p><p>OFTEN END UP ACCEPTING ALMOST ANY JOB THEY CAN FIND. </p><p> </p><p>NEW PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACT STEAMS PRIVATE EMPLOYERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. ON FEBRUARY 27, ARAN (THE OPM-EQUIVALENT THAT REPRESENTS </p><p>PUBLIC MINISTRIES) AND THE THREE LARGEST UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT.  THE PACT ESTABLISHES </p><p>NEW REGULATIONS AND SALARIES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIONS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OVERALL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON BARGAINING ESTABLISHED IN 1993.  THE THREE </p><p>MAJOR CONFEDERATIONS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES OVER </p><p>BARGAINING PRIORITIES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR CONTRACTS (WHICH </p><p>ARE NEGOTIATED NATIONALLY FOR EACH INDUSTRIAL/SERVICE </p><p>SECTOR) AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S LABOR MARKET REFORM PROPOSALS </p><p>TO PRESENT A UNITED BARGAINING FRONT ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR </p><p>CONTRACT.  AS A RESULT, THEY SECURED AN AVERAGE SALARY </p><p>INCREASE OF 5.7% FOR PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES - SOME 1 </p><p>PERCENT GREATER THAN THE INFLATION TARGET ESTABLISHED BY THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR, GENERALLY USED AS A GUIDE </p><p>FOR SALARY INCREASES IN THE NEW ROUND OF LABOR BARGAINING. </p><p>PRIVATE EMPLOYERS CRITICIZED THE NEW CONTRACT.  THEY CALLED </p><p>THE SALARY INCREASES OVERLY GENEROUS AND INDICATED IT WILL </p><p>MAKE BARGAINING OVER THE NEW SET OF PRIVATE SECTOR CONTRACTS </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT, AS THE CONFEDERATIONS SEEK COMPARABLE SALARY </p><p>INCREASES FROM EMPLOYERS SEEMINGLY DETERMINED TO HOLD WAGE </p><p>INCREASES TO MORE MODEST LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACT DOES NOT INTRODUCE NEW </p><p>FLEXIBLE LABOR ARRANGEMENTS (SUCH AS JOB-SHARING AND STAFF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01360  02 OF 03  311337Z </p><p>LEASING) RECENTLY PASSED BY THE PARLIAMENT; THE LABOR </p><p>MINISTRY IS STILL WRITING THE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE </p><p>INNOVATIVE PROVISIONS.  HOWEVER, IT DOES CONTAIN NEW MEASURE </p><p>TO FIGHT SEXUAL ABUSE AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT IN THE </p><p>WORKPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>EMPLOYERS, TRADE UNIONS COOKING UP REMEDIES TO DECLINING </p><p>COMPETITIVENESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. ITALY\'S THREE MAJOR TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS HAVE </p><p>LAUNCHED A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS WITH CONFINDUSTRIA, THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL CONFEDERATION FOR LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANIES, </p><p>ON POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE DECLINING </p><p>COMPETITIVENESS OF ITALY\'S INDUSTRIAL SECTOR.  THE PARTIES </p><p>HAVE CREATED FOUR DISCUSSION FORA TO ADDRESS KEY ASPECTS: </p><p>RESEARCH, INFRASTRUCTURE, TRAINING AND THE MEZZOGIORNO (THE </p><p>SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE ITALIAN PENINSULA, WHICH SUFFERS FROM </p><p>CHRONIC HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND COMPARATIVELY LOW INVESTMENT). </p><p>PARTNERED OFF IN THESE FOR A, LABOR AND MANAGEMENT INTEND TO </p><p>DEVELOP JOINT PROPOSALS TO PRESENT TO THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT: IN SOME CASES, SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS </p><p>FOR FUNDING, IN OTHERS ADJUSTMENTS TO LEGISLATION OR </p><p>REGULATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.

BOTH LABOR </p><p>AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING MORE </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT PRIVATE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AND </p><p>TO BUILD ON THOSE AREAS, SUCH AS DESIGN, AT WHICH ITALIAN </p><p>INDUSTRY EXCELS.  EVEN IF THE TALKS FAIL TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE </p><p>SPECIFIC RESULTS, THEY COULD FOSTER A MORE PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ATMOSPHERE FOR UPCOMING NEGOTIATIONS OVER PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>WAGES AND BENEFITS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER WORKPLACE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENT APPROVES SWEEPING EDUCATION REFORM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. ON MARCH 12, THE SENATE PASSED THE FIRST MAJOR REFORM TO </p><p>ITALY\'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN 80 YEARS.  THE REFORM PACKAGE </p><p>IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF PUBLIC </p><p>EDUCATION.   IN PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH MORE CHOICE AND </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVISE A MORE PERSONALIZED EDUCATION, THE </p><p>PACKAGE SHOULD HELP LOWER THE NATION\'S CURRENT DROPOUT RATE </p><p>OF 10.5 PERCENT, SUPPORTERS CLAIM.  THE REFORMED SYSTEM </p><p>SHOULD ALSO PRODUCE A MORE VARIED/SKILL-DIVERSIFIED POOL OF </p><p>GRADUATES BETTER PREPARED TO FILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF </p><p>EMPLOYERS IN A CHANGING ECONOMY.  THE REFORM PACKAGE, </p><p>SUPPORTERS ASSERT, IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN IMPROVING </p><p>ITALY\'S COMPETITIVENESS WITH FELLOW EU MEMBER-STATES AND </p><p>OTHER COMPETITORS. </p><p> </p><p>12.

STUDENTS WILL ALSO </p><p>GAIN OPPORTUNITIES TO RECEIVE PRACTICAL TRAINING THROUGH </p><p>APPRENTICESHIP OR INTERNSHIP-STYLE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE </p><p>LABOR MARKET TO COMPLEMENT THEIR TRADITIONAL STUDIES. </p><p>FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTION WILL BEGIN </p><p>IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL; A SECOND FOREIGN LANGUAGE WILL BE </p><p>ADDED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.  STUDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND </p><p>SCHOOL OR RELATED PROGRAMS FOR AT LEAST TWELVE YEARS. </p><p>FORMAL EDUCATION, PRACTICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AND LABOR </p><p>MARKET NEEDS WILL BE BETTER INTEGRATED, ALLOWING STUDENTS TO </p><p>GAIN PRACTICAL EXPOSURE TO POSSIBLE PROFESSIONS AND TO </p><p>PERSONALIZE CURRICULUMS. A SIMPLIFIED EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR </p><p>STUDENTS AND NEW RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES FOR PROFESSORS ALSO </p><p>WILL BE INTRODUCED. </p><p> </p><p>13.
