(SBU) Honduran government officials are working hard to </p><p>close the gap with the International Monetary Fund over a </p><p>new three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) </p><p>program.  With plans for new revenue measures of usd 175 </p><p>million and planned reduction in costs (primarily personnel </p><p>cuts) of usd 35 million, the government believes it can </p><p>reduce the central government deficit to three percent of </p><p>GDP for 2003, down from 5.6 percent in 2002.   The GOH is </p><p>already implementing recommendations by the Fund in the </p><p>financial sector and working closely with the World Bank-IMF </p><p>evaluation of the financial sector.   A delegation of 4-6 </p><p>IMF directors will visit Honduras January 17-21.  The GOH\'s </p><p>macroeconomic team will return to Washington after that </p><p>visit to review tax reform legislation before sending it to </p><p>Congress in early February.   The GOH hopes that the IMF </p><p>mission would return to Honduras in March, after approval of </p><p>the legislation to sign off on a letter of intent, and that </p><p>the program could go to the IMF Board in April.  The IMF\'s </p><p>insistence on major reductions in public sector salaries as </p><p>percent of GDP continues to be the main sticking point, </p><p>along with the associated timing of the folding-in of </p><p>teachers into a planned civil service reform program.   End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Significant Revenue Measures Planned </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ministry of Finance has identified new revenue </p><p>measures that will raise central government income by 2.8 </p><p>percent of GDP (about usd 175 million).  These measures </p><p>include: elimination of exemptions from the sales tax, an </p><p>implementation of withholding taxes designed to reduce </p><p>evasion of sales and income taxes, broadening of the base </p><p>for income tax to include a higher percentage of bonuses and </p><p>benefits packages, and the taxing of the retirement income </p><p>above a specified level.  The government plans to introduce </p><p>a decree to eliminate the tax exemption for diesel used in </p><p>the production of electricity (this exemption is believed to </p><p>be the source of enormous tax evasion); the state-owned </p><p>power company ENEE would be charged with negotiating an </p><p>adjustment to the price paid to private electricity </p><p>generation companies to cover this tax change.  The Finance </p><p>Ministry plans to direct credit card companies to send sales </p><p>tax payments directly to the tax authorities (the DEI) in </p><p>order to avoid evasion of sales tax and help collect the </p><p>planned withholding taxes.  Vice Minister William Chong Wong </p><p>noted that this type of measure has been extremely </p><p>successful in El Salvador and other countries.  The Finance </p><p>Ministry also wants to require audits for companies with </p><p>more than ten million lempiras (approx. usd 593,000) in </p><p>sales annually, and to make financial officers of companies </p><p>and accounting firms more accountable for intentional tax </p><p>evasion.  Chong Wong is heading up the effort to draft </p><p>reforms to the income tax law and tax code.  The GOH plans </p><p>to review these draft legal changes with the IMF in mid to </p><p>late January. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Wage Bill Reductions - Sticking Point with IMF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On the expenditure side, the GOH has identified </p><p>some one-time measures that will reduce government spending </p><p>and the wage bill by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2003.  Six </p><p>thousand teachers who are over 65 years old will be retired </p><p>in early January (an overdue legal requirement) and will be </p><p>replaced by younger teachers with lower salaries.  Similar </p><p>measures will be taken among state-employed medical staff. </p><p>The government is also cleaning up its payroll records (to </p><p>be completed by February) and expects to be able to achieve </p><p>savings of 200 million lempiras (approx. usd 11.9 million) </p><p>per year by reducing ghost workers and individuals receiving </p><p>multiple full-time salaries. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to Finance Minister Alvarado, however, </p><p>the IMF is pushing for additional reductions in the wage </p><p>bill as a percent of GDP: </p><p> </p><p>     2002     10.7 percent </p><p>     2003     10.1 percent </p><p>     2004      9.1 percent </p><p>     2005      8.1 percent </p><p> </p><p>The GOH does not see how they can meet these targets. </p><p>Alvarado (strictly protect) has now proposed to the Cabinet </p><p>a public sector wage freeze for 2003.  There is some </p><p>interest but the government remains stymied over the idea of </p><p>freezing teacher salaries only months after reaching a </p><p>settlement on teacher wage increases for 2002-2005. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) During the December 16-17 consultations between the </p><p>GOH macroeconomic team and the IMF in Washington, the </p><p>government finally shared its draft Civil Service Framework </p><p>bill.  Discussion focused on Article 110, which currently </p><p>says that the teachers will be folded into overall state </p><p>wage policy by 2006, indicating that the salary provisions </p><p>of the estatutos (laws governing particular professions) </p><p>will be eliminated that year.  Alvarado said that IMF staff </p><p>are insisting that the teachers be covered by the civil </p><p>service reform immediately upon adoption of the law.  The </p><p>GOH has commented that the World Bank is more understanding </p><p>of their stance on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>The Results: Sizable Projected Reduction in Government </p><p>Deficit Based on Reforms That Could Get Through Congress </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The central government deficit for 2002 is </p><p>estimated to be 5.6 percent of GDP.  This deficit is </p><p>projected to decline to 5.1 percent in 2003 if no further </p><p>measures are implemented.  The IMF mission in November </p><p>estimated that the reforms envisioned by the GOH would bring </p><p>down the central government deficit to 4.0 percent of GDP. </p><p>Finance Minister Alvarado is now saying that he can get it </p><p>down to 3.0 percent of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The government is determined, however, to go to the </p><p>Congress only once more on major fiscal reforms.  For this </p><p>reason, they want to be absolutely sure the IMF is on board </p><p>with all legislative proposals before they are sent to the </p><p>legislature.  At the same time, the GOH is certain that any </p><p>further changes to the agreement with the teachers would </p><p>undermine congressional approval.  On the expenditure side, </p><p>they believe they\'ve gone as far as they can go.  Minister </p><p>Alvarado noted, in a meeting with Econ Counselor and AID </p><p>economist on December 31, that the GOH wants to be sure it </p><p>can deliver what it promises.  He alluded to problems that </p><p>Nicaragua is already having in getting its program approved </p><p>by the legislature. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The GOH was heartened by the Honduran Congress\' </p><p>easy acceptance of the austerity budget for 2003 on December </p><p>4.  The budget was virtually unchanged from the 2002 budget </p><p>in nominal terms, with the exception of usd 262 million in </p><p>needed infrastructure projects, meaning that most ministries </p><p>will face cuts in real terms of about eight percent after </p><p>accounting for inflation.  The Congress identified new </p><p>funding for all of these infrastructure projects. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Public Enterprises Still A Concern </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. The declining surpluses in the key public enterprises </p><p>(electricity utility ENEE, phone company Hondutel, and the </p><p>Port Authority) remain a concern.  Finance Minister Alvarado </p><p>acknowledged that while ENEE\'s financial picture should </p><p>improve by 2004-2006 when high cost power contracts are </p><p>replaced by new low-cost Lufussa and AES projects (see ref </p><p>b), 2003 is going to be a very tough year for the state- </p><p>owned electricity utility.  The government plans a series of </p><p>privatization and liberalization initiatives in 2003 and </p><p>2004, including privatization of some port facilities, the </p><p>postal system and some roads.  This may help increase </p><p>government revenues in the short run and efficiency in the </p><p>long run.  Privatization of Hondutel, a twice failed </p><p>undertaking, remains a politically charged issue, with the </p><p>government in denial about the true low value of the utility </p><p>to an outside investor and the fairly strong union trying to </p><p>fight any changes.  A GOH requested study of liberalization </p><p>of the telecom sector in Honduras has been approved by the </p><p>U.S. Trade Development Agency and should begin in the first </p><p>half of 2003.  In the power sector, the GOH has the results </p><p>of a USAID sponsored white paper on modernization.  To </p><p>depoliticize the issue, the GOH is no longer talking about </p><p>privatization of ENEE, but rather the unbundling of its </p><p>generation, transmission and distribution activities. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Financial Sector: Actions Underway </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) As reported in Ref C, Banking and Insurance </p><p>Commission President Ana Cristina Mejia de Pereira </p><p>apparently is making strides in meeting prior action </p><p>requirements of the Fund in the financial sector.  Banco </p><p>Capital was liquidated on December 19.  The GOH needed to </p><p>tap into about usd 30 million of Hondutel cash to cover the </p><p>deposit insurance for this failed bank; the Minister of </p><p>Finance indicated to emboffs on December 31 that this is the </p><p>last time he will authorize use of those funds to cover a </p><p>bank failure.  The Commission has ordered an appraisal of </p><p>the value of Banco Sogerin, the other bank which the </p><p>government took over in May, and hopes to be able to sell it </p><p>in February (three potential purchasers have shown </p><p>interest).  The Commission is working closely with five </p><p>additional banks to ensure they meet the higher </p><p>capitalization requirements.  Two or three of these banks </p><p>will probably be sold to larger banks; in the remaining </p><p>cases, the shareholders are providing the needed additional </p><p>capital. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Road to a Program </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The GOH has invited interested IMF executive </p><p>directors to visit Honduras January 17-21.  Alvarado, </p><p>Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza and Central Bank </p><p>President Maria Elena Mondragon plan to return to Washington </p><p>right after that visit to provide IMF staff with detailed </p><p>proposals and projections and to review their drafts for new </p><p>legislation.  The new laws would be submitted to Congress </p><p>upon their return for adoption in February and to enter into </p><p>force on March 1.  The GOH hopes that the IMF mission would </p><p>then return to Honduras to complete a letter of intent on a </p><p>new three-year PRGF, and Honduras\' program would go to the </p><p>IMF board in April.  Speed is vital at this point.  Quite a </p><p>few World Bank, Interamerican Development Bank, and </p><p>bilateral aid programs are on hold until Honduras gets back </p><p>on track with an IMF program.  Honduras is off track for </p><p>HIPC debt relief and is now accumulating new arrears in its </p><p>service of its Paris Club debt (arrears estimated at over </p><p>usd 70 million at this point).  USG agencies should track </p><p>this carefully, as the Brooke Amendment could come into </p><p>force as early as March 31, forcing agencies such as USAID </p><p>to begin drawdown plans. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) If the government adopts the identified measures </p><p>and is successful in reducing the central government deficit </p><p>to three percent of GDP (i.e. a 2.5 percentage point </p><p>reduction over the passive expected level), that will be a </p><p>substantial achievement.  Similarly, adoption of the long- </p><p>awaited civil service reform that would provide the GOH with </p><p>control over wage policy and create a career civil service </p><p>would be important moves.  If real progress is made in these </p><p>areas in the next month, the GOH will have a much stronger </p><p>hand with which to convince the IMF to accept a slower </p><p>timetable on inclusion of the teachers in the civil service </p><p>reform. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The other possible development that could help the </p><p>fiscal imbalance is a resumption of economic growth.   It </p><p>will be important for the GOH to start focusing on measures, </p><p>other than tax incentives, which can be taken to attract </p><p>investment and improve the business climate. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
