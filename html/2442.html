<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000320 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO SUMMARIZES HIS </p><p>ZIMBABWE VISIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 200 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On January 25, during a brief pull aside prior to a </p><p>larger meeting on a just established USAID program for </p><p>agricultural assistance, President Obasanjo briefed me on his </p><p>January 20-21 trip to Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Obasanjo recounted that his discussion with Mugabe </p><p>focused mainly on the need for the Zimbabwean to clean up the </p><p>political arena.  The President told Mugabe that he would </p><p>like to be able to support him in the Commonwealth but could </p><p>not help Mugabe in that assembly unless Mugabe pledged </p><p>himself and the GOZ to free and fair elections in March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Mugabe did not voice opposition to fair elections </p><p>and indicated his understanding of Nigeria\'s position </p><p>regarding the Commonwealth, Obasanjo said.  Attempting to </p><p>show his commitment to a free and fair contest but </p><p>maintaining his animus towards London, Mugabe stated he would </p><p>allow all EU and Commonwealth election observers, except for </p><p>the UK, Obasanjo noted.  The door would also open to the </p><p>foreign press to cover the election, except for UK-based </p><p>media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Obasanjo reported that the Africa Union would form a </p><p>Foreign Ministers task force, which would presumably include </p><p>Nigeria\'s Lamido, to meet on Zimbabwe. The group would meet </p><p>February 10-11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In an effort to ease political tensions and to give </p><p>the public a sign that reconciliation was possible, Obasanjo </p><p>tried to broker a meeting between Mugabe and MDC leader </p><p>Tsvangirai; however, Mugabe rejected the offer. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Obasanjo concluded the pull aside, stating that he </p><p>briefed Tsvangirai on his meeting with Mugabe and that the </p><p>MDC leader seemed pleased. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
