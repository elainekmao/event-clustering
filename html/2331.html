<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 003238 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W, AF/RA AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1, 1.6X5, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SSS DG ARE ON AL QAIDA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 208320 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2560 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2405 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.6X1, </p><p>1.6X5, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) During a December 11 call on State Security Service </p><p>Director General Kayode Are, Ambassador Jeter (accompanied by </p><p>RAO and PolMilOff) thanked Are for the GON\'s efforts to </p><p>combat terrorism and to ensure the safety of official and </p><p>non-official Americans in Nigeria.  Jeter presented reftel </p><p>points, emphasizing the need for Nigeria to be sensitive to </p><p>the possibility that Taliban and Al Qaida members could </p><p>conceivably seek refuge here.  Are said the SSS, in </p><p>cooperation with other Nigerian Security Agencies, remained </p><p>vigilant to that possibility.  Are further noted that he had </p><p>heard a story about a Nigerian named "Agrah" who had been </p><p>identified as fighting for the Taleban, but dismissed the </p><p>story, saying that "Agrah" was not a Nigerian name. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Are stated that SSS investigations had increased as </p><p>a result of 9/11.  In reference to the visa and entry/exit </p><p>stamps in one of the hijackers passport (also see Refs B and </p><p>C), Are said the SSS had concluded that the individual had, </p><p>in fact, never visited Nigeria.  The visa was fraudulent, </p><p>there had been no entry card, and the signature on the entry </p><p>stamp was not that of the immigration officer on duty at the </p><p>time.  Are speculated that the false documents had been </p><p>obtained from a Nigerian syndicate operating in Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Are asked if there were any connection between </p><p>Hizballah and Al Qaida?  RAO said there did not appear to be </p><p>a direct connection (one being Shi\'a; the other Sunni), but </p><p>that cross-pollination was always a possibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) In response to Ambassador Jeter\'s question about </p><p>media reports of Nigeria deporting six Pakistani nationals, </p><p>Are explained that while no troubling connections had been </p><p>found between the Pakistani proselytizers and terrorism, the </p><p>decision was made to deport them now, but with the promise </p><p>that they might return next year.  He explained that the </p><p>media had blown the story out of proportion drawing a </p><p>connection to terrorism.  The Lagos-based Muslim NGO called </p><p>"Tabliq" organized the proselytizing trips, and had been </p><p>doing so for years.  Are stated that he planned to meet with </p><p>the leaders of Tabliq to discuss their operations, and that </p><p>they should be allowed to continue if there were no illicit </p><p>connections.  However, the SSS Director General expressed </p><p>concern regarding the funding for the organization, which </p><p>came through wire transfers from sources in Pakistan, India </p><p>and Malaysia. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
