SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Nova Scotia provincial government remains </p><p>optimistic about the future of the Deep Panuke offshore </p><p>natural gas project despite EnCanaQs decision to halt work </p><p>for the time being.  The province is eager to persuade USG </p><p>officials of Atlantic CanadaQs importance in ensuring a </p><p>secure, long-term energy supply for North America.  (END </p><p>SUMMARY) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Nova ScotiaQs newly appointed Energy Minster, Ernie </p><p>Fage, focused on the Deep Panuke offshore natural gas </p><p>project during his first meeting with CG on February 27. </p><p>Fage acknowledged that he has taken over the energy </p><p>portfolio from his predecessor Gordon Balser at a difficult </p><p>time for the province\'s energy sector.  Just the previous </p><p>day, federal and provincial regulators agreed to </p><p>discontinue their public review of the Deep Panuke project </p><p>at the request of the projectQs principal sponsor, the </p><p>EnCana Corporation of Calgary.  The company announced on </p><p>February 14 that it was asking for the "time-out" while it </p><p>undertook a comprehensive review of the project.  Company </p><p>officials cited concerns over the availability of </p><p>sufficient gas reserves to make the project economically </p><p>viable. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Minister Fage admitted that the main problem lies </p><p>in disappointment in some quarters over the lower-than- </p><p>expected quantities of new, exploitable natural gas </p><p>reserves discovered thus far in the areas offshore Nova </p><p>Scotia.  Estimates of the recoverable portion of this gas </p><p>field have been declining from the 1.2 trillion cubic feet </p><p>of gas originally projected.  EnCana\'s had initially hoped </p><p>to begin supplying gas to the U.S. northeast by 2006, but </p><p>the company now has no idea of the new start-up date. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Despite the obvious bad news to Nova Scotia\'s </p><p>developing energy sector, Minster Fage said he agreed with </p><p>industry observers that that EnCana\'s delay was primarily a </p><p>business decision.  The minister acknowledged that </p><p>uncertainty over the size of the gas reserves was making </p><p>Deep Panuke less attractive than EnCana\'s other investments </p><p>elsewhere, such as in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. </p><p>He also speculated that the company, which just came into </p><p>existence last year through a merger between PanCanadian </p><p>and Alberta Energy Company, may still be sorting out its </p><p>priorities and moving those with a quicker return on </p><p>investment to the top of the list. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Taking a long-term view, Fage echoed comments by many </p><p>in the industry who believe that Deep Panuke may follow the </p><p>model of the Sable Island project, whose development </p><p>languished in the doldrums for years before the discovery </p><p>of new reserves and changing economic conditions propelled </p><p>the project into the production phase.  Just how long the </p><p>delay will be for Deep Panuke, the Minster predicted, might </p><p>depend on world energy prices.  Equally important will be </p><p>the results of EnCana\'s various exploratory drilling </p><p>activities in the Nova Scotia offshore areas, as well as </p><p>those of other companies determined to find economically- </p><p>viable natural gas there.  Fage said he expected that there </p><p>will be 8-10 new exploratory wells this year, bringing the </p><p>total value of work commitments to the level of C$1.5 </p><p>billion. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  While some of FageQs comments about Deep </p><p>Panuke may reflect the provinceQs forced optimism, the </p><p>overall prospects for the offshore energy sector in </p><p>Atlantic Canada remain very strong.  The Minister displayed </p><p>eagerness to get the message across to senior USG officials </p><p>that this region can play a vital role in producing secure, </p><p>long-term energy supplies for North America.  Fage will be </p><p>traveling to Houston and Washington in March, then </p><p>attending the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston in </p><p>May.  CG offered to help arrange appointments for him with </p><p>appropriate USG federal officials.  The Minister promised </p><p>to get back to us with his schedule.
