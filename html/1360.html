(C) SUMMARY: ON NOVEMBER 21, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC), BRIEFED THE HARARE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON THE </p><p>MDC VIEW OF THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>AN EU-SADC CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN BOTSWANA NOVEMBER 24 </p><p>TO DECEMBER 1.  TSVANGIRAI SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>SADC, THE EU, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEAL </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE\'S CRISIS WITH FORESIGHT.  THE MDC LEADER </p><p>STATED THAT HE IS NOT SEEKING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE MDC, BUT SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PRINCIPLES IN ZIMBABWE.  TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAD TRIED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ) AND THE RULING ZANU-PF IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>SINCE THE JUNE ELECTIONS, BUT HAD BEEN CONSISTENTLY MET </p><p>WITH HOSTILITY AND VINDICTIVENESS.  HE OUTLINED FOUR </p><p>FUTURE SCENARIOS OF DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS HE AND HIS </p><p>PARTY ARE CONSIDERING: 1) WAITING FOR THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, 2) EARLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, </p><p>3) MASS ACTION WITH NO GOVERNMENT REPRESSION, AND 4) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06564  01 OF 03  221603Z </p><p>MASS ACTION RESULTING IN POLICE AND MILITARY REPRESSION </p><p>THAT COULD LEAD TO MARTIAL LAW.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THE MDC </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE HAD MADE A DECISION ON THE QUESTION </p><p>OF MASS ACTION, AND THE PARTY COUNCIL WILL MEET NOVEMBER </p><p>24 TO VOTE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE\'S DECISION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BRIEFS THE HARARE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECONOFF ATTENDED A NOVEMBER 21 BRIEFING BY THE </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOR THE HARARE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  THE BRIEFING WAS WELL ATTENDED BY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE MAJOR DONOR COUNTRIES. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID THE PURPOSE OF THE BRIEFING WAS TO SHARE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE MDC\'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE PRIOR TO </p><p>AN EU-SADC CONFERENCE IN BOTSWANA FROM NOVEMBER 24 TO </p><p>DECEMBER 1.  HE STATED THAT THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR HAD </p><p>WANTED THE MDC INVITED TO THE CONFERENCE, BUT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA HAD VETOED THIS DECISION AS </p><p>"UNDEMOCRATIC."  (NOTE: TSVANGIRAI DID NOT SAY WHAT </p><p>COUNTRY THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR WAS ACCREDITED TO, AND </p><p>ECONOFF WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A CLARIFICATION ON THIS. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.

WHAT </p><p>IS CRITICAL IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORTS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>WHEN ASKED WHAT HAD BEEN HIS GOAL IN MEETING WITH NELSON </p><p>MANDELA A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, TSVANGIRAI STATED IT WAS </p><p>TWO-FOLD: FIRST, MANDELA HAS TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE AND </p><p>CLOUT IN THE REGION, AND COULD COMMUNICATE TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA THE IMPORTANCE OF REVIEWING </p><p>ITS POSITION ON THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE; AND SECOND, TO </p><p>GIVE ASSURANCE THAT AN MDC GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT SEEK </p><p>RETRIBUTION AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE STATED THAT HE </p><p>WAS NOT ASKING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, OR MANDELA, </p><p>TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE GOZ, BUT RATHER TO BRING REASON </p><p>TO BEAR. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>DEALING WITH ZANU-PF AND THE GOZ </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT THE MDC HAD TRIED (AFTER </p><p>THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS) TO WORK WITH THE GOZ </p><p>AND ZANU-PF IN PARLIAMENT ON ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN, </p><p>SUCH AS THE ECONOMY AND LAND REFORM, BUT FOUND THE GOZ </p><p>AND ZANU-PF VINDICTIVE AND UNWILLING TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY.  THE MDC LEADER EXPLAINED THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>IS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THAT PUBLIC OPINION IN MUCH OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY IS AGAINST THEM, AND IT IS WILLING TO USE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4750 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06564  02 OF 03  221604Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------A2C377  221613Z /38 </p><p>P 221602Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7682 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06564  02 OF 03  221604Z </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI BRIEFS DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON MDC </p><p>VIEWS; SAYS DECISION ON A MASS ACTION WILL BE MADE </p><p>NOVEMBER 24 </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE TO STAY IN POWER.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THIS IS </p><p>EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE OCCURRING IN </p><p>MARONDERA WEST, WHERE A BY-ELECTION FOR A SEAT IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT WILL BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  HE WAS </p><p>SCHEDULED TO SPEAK AT AN MDC RALLY IN MARONDERA ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 17, BUT CANCELLED WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WOULD RESORT TO VIOLENCE </p><p>TO DISRUPT THE RALLY. </p><p> (NOTE: A VIOLENT ALTERCATION </p><p>BETWEEN ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS AND MDC SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>MARONDERA STILL OCCURRED ON NOVEMBER 17, AND AN INNOCENT </p><p>BYSTANDER WAS SHOT DEAD IN AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE.  END </p><p>NOTE).  TSVANGIRAI STATED IT WAS CLEAR THERE CAN BE NO </p><p>PEACEFUL FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, </p><p>AND THAT THE MDC WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO </p><p>WITHDRAWING FROM THIS OR OTHER ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THE FOUR FUTURE SCENARIOS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) TSVANGIRAI TOLD HIS AUDIENCE THAT THE MDC WAS NOW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06564  02 OF 03  221604Z </p><p>CONSIDERING FOUR FUTURE SCENARIOS FOR ITS ROLE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE: </p><p> </p><p>  1) WAIT FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>     THE PROBLEM WITH THIS STRATEGY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE </p><p>     IMPATIENT AND WANT CHANGE NOW.  HE ALSO QUESTIONED </p><p>     WHO WAS GOING TO UNDERWRITE THE GOZ FOR THE NEXT 18 </p><p>     MONTHS WHILE IT DESTROYS THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>  2) AN ACCELERATED CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS LEADING TO </p><p>     EARLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>     HE SAID THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE OPTION BECAUSE </p><p>     PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS LOST HIS MANDATE TO RULE, </p><p>     AND WHY SHOULD THE PEOPLE WAIT 18 MONTHS FOR A </p><p>     CHANGE WHEN THE COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD IT. </p><p> </p><p>  3) A MASS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>     THE QUESTIONS ARE WHEN WILL IT OCCUR, AND WILL </p><p>     IT PLUNGE ZIMBABWE INTO CHAOS?  HE STATED THAT HE </p><p>     WANTED ANY MASS ACTION TO BE PEACEFUL AND WITHIN </p><p>     THE LAW, AND THAT THE GOZ WILL NOT RESPOND WITH </p><p>     FORCE AGAINST A PEACEFUL MASS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>  4) A MASS ACTION WITH GOZ REPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p>     TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE GROUP THAT HE WAS CONCERNED </p><p>     THAT A MASS ACTION WOULD BE MET BY SEVERE POLICE </p><p>     AND MILITARY REPRESSION, POSSIBLY EVEN LEADING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06564  02 OF 03  221604Z </p><p>     MARTIAL LAW.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THIS SCENARIO </p><p>     WOULD HAPPEN, BECAUSE THE POLICE AND MILITARY IN </p><p>     ZIMBABWE RESPECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF </p><p>     CIVILIAN CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MDC TO LEAD MASS ACTION IN DECEMBER? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AFTER LAYING OUT THESE SCENARIOS, TSVANGIRAI TOLD </p><p>THE GATHERING THAT THE MDC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE HAD MADE A </p><p>DECISION REGARDING WHETHER TO CALL FOR A MASS ACTION. </p><p>(COMMENT: TSVANGIRAI WAS DELIBERATELY VAGUE ON WHAT THE </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE HAD DECIDED.  END COMMENT.)  THE </p><p>PARTY COUNCIL, REPRESENTING THE MDC\'S 12 PROVINCES, WILL </p><p>MEET NOVEMBER 24 TO VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE\'S DECISION.  (NOTE: THE MDC DIVIDES </p><p>ZIMBABWE INTO 12 "PROVINCES" FOR REPRESENTATION ON ITS </p><p>PARTY COUNCIL, WHICH IS THE SUPREME DECISION-MAKING BODY </p><p>OF THE MDC.  THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE ACTS ON THE </p><p>COUNCIL\'S BEHALF WHEN IT IS NOT IN SESSION.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>MEETS INFREQUENTLY AND ONLY TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7.
