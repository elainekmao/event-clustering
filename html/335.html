DURING THE 30-MINUTE </p><p>MEETING WHICH PRECEDED LUNCH, DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE FY </p><p> </p><p>90 U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO YEMEN.  THE U.S. CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT TOTAL U.S. FY 90 ASSISTANCE WILL BE 47.5 MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- 21 MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, </p><p>-- 25 MILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD ASSISTANCE PL-480 TITLE I, </p><p>-- 500,000 DOLLARS IN FMS, AND </p><p>-- 1 MILLION DOLLARS IN IMET. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE U.S. SIDE DESCRIBED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE 25 MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS IN PL-480 AS FOLLOWS:  AN AGREEMENT FOR 5 MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS IN RICE UNDER TITLE I PL-480 HAS ALREADY BEEN </p><p>SIGNED.  THIS IS THAT PORTION OF THE FY 89 PROGRAM WHICH </p><p>MOVED TO FY 90.  THE U.S. AND YEMEN ARE PREPARED TO SIGN </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 25 A SECOND AGREEMENT ON 10 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL RICE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT </p><p>ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE 5 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW FEED </p><p>GRAIN PROGRAM.  AID ACTING ADMINISTRATOR EDELMAN ADDED </p><p>THAT HE COULD NOW ALSO ANNOUNCE U.S. WILLINGNESS TO ADD AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN FEED GRAINS TO THE 5 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED.  HE ATTRIBUTED THIS </p><p>NEW DEVELOPMENT TO THE EFFECTIVE EFFORTS OF AMBASSADOR </p><p>DUNBAR DURING THE DAYS PRECEDING THE VISIT.  THE YEMENI </p><p>SIDE WAS TOLD THAT 20 MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE NOT INCLUDED IS THE 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN RICE </p><p>CARRIED OVER FROM FY 89 WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER EXTRA </p><p>CONCESSIONAL TERMS, WHICH INCLUDES A TEN-YEAR GRACE PERIOD </p><p>AND A 40-YEAR REPAYMENT SCHEDULE. </p><p> </p><p>5. PRESIDENT SALEH EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE YAR.  HE TOLD THE SECRETARY THAT HE </p><p>WANTED HIS VISIT TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPRINT ON U.S.-YEMENI </p><p>RELATIONS -- A LAUNCHING POINT FOR A STRONGER BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  THIS WAS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF </p><p>THE RECENT DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WORLD.  HE ASKED </p><p>FOR FURTHER U.S. ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR YEMEN\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ITS ECONOMY.  HE REQUESTED U.S. HELP IN </p><p>OBTAINING LOANS FROM THE WORLD BANK IN SUPPORT OF YEMEN\'S </p><p>FIVE-YEAR PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE SECRETARY CONFIRMED THAT WE DO SUPPORT YEMEN\'S </p><p>BORROWING FROM THE IDA BUT THAT HE UNDERSTANDS YEMEN </p><p>CURRENTLY HAS 250 MILLION DOLLARS IN UNDISBURSED LOANS. </p><p>THE SECRETARY ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING </p><p>MORE SPECIFIC THAT WE COULD DO TO ASSIST YEMEN.  MINISTER </p><p>ATTAR RAISED THE 220 KILOMETER HUTH-HARAD ROAD PROJECT. </p><p>HE SAID YEMEN HAS WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR 10 MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS BUT NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL  15 MILLION DOLLARS. </p><p>FURTHER, THE YAR WISHES TO PAY 20 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL </p><p>COSTS OF THE PROJECT FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY GENERATED BY </p><p>PL-480 SALES.  FINALLY, THEY HOPE THE WORLD BANK WILL </p><p>AGREE TO "FORCED ACCOUNT," WHEREBY THE PROJECT IS EXECUTED </p><p>SOLELY BY YEMENI ENTERPRISES.  THE SECRETARY REPLIED THAT </p><p>WE WOULD GET THE DETAILS AND SEE HOW WE CAN HELP. </p><p> </p><p>7. THERE THEN FOLLOWED A RATHER DISJOINTED DISCUSSION OF </p><p>MONEY WHICH THE YEMENIS BELIEVED HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THEM BY </p><p>THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR MILITARY, BUT WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER </p><p>RECEIVED.  PRESIDENT SALEH THOUGHT THERE REMAINED 17 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ORIGINAL SAUDI COMMITMENT OF 400 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS IN 1978 TO PAY FOR U.S. PLANES AND TANKS. </p><p>HE ARGUED THAT THE U.S. HAD THIS BALANCE IN ITS ACCOUNTS </p><p>AND SHOULD GIVE IT TO THE YEMENIS RATHER THAN RETURNING IT </p><p>TO THE SAUDIS.  THE U.S. SIDE ATTEMPTED TO TO EXPLAIN </p><p>THAT, IF INDEED THE SAUDIS HAD DEPOSITED ALL OF THE 400 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE FMS ACCOUNT, THAT MONEY REMAINED </p><p>LEGALLY THEIRS.  THE U.S. SIDE WAS NOT CERTAIN, IN FACT, </p><p>THAT THERE WAS A BALANCE FROM THE ORIGINAL 1978 PROGRAM. </p><p>THE SECRETARY ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION AS TO WHETHER </p><p>PRESIDENT SALEH WAS ASKING US TO WEIGH IN WITH THE SAUDIS, </p><p>INDICATING THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER IT IF THAT WERE THEIR </p><p>REQUEST.  PRESIDENT SALEH DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RESPOND TO </p><p>THE SECRETARY BUT PROCEEDED TO DESCRIBE THE AWKWARD </p><p>TRILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH THE U.S., SAUDI ARABIA, AND </p><p>YEMEN HAVE IN SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY PROGRAM IN THE YAR. </p><p>HE SEEMED TO CONFUSE THE EARLIER ISSUE OF A 17 MILLION </p><p>DOLLAR BALANCE IN THE ACCOUNT WITH SAUDI REFUSAL TO </p><p>DELIVER A SIMILARLY VALUED AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND SPARE </p><p>PARTS.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER INTERJECTED THAT A FEW YEARS </p><p>AGO THE U.S. HAD OFFERED YAR 14 MILLION DOLLARS IN FMS </p><p>CREDITS, BUT THAT THE CREDITS WERE OFFERED AT SUCH A HIGH </p><p>INTEREST RATE THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE USED.  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT MAYBE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE TERMS. </p><p>THE SECRETARY SAID WE WOULD LOOK INTO IT. </p><p> </p><p>//GSM PROGRAM// </p><p> </p><p>8. THE PRESIDENT AGAIN RAISED FOOD ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID </p><p>YEMEN NEEDS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF WHEAT ANNUALLY </p><p>AND HE NEEDS U.S. HELP IN OBTAINING THAT VOLUME OF WHEAT </p><p>ON THE SAME CONDITIONS CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY ALGERIA AND </p><p>EGYPT.  MINISTER ATTAR NOTED THAT YEMEN NOW GETS ONLY </p><p>THREE YEARS FOR REPAYMENT AND WANTS EITHER FIVE OR SEVEN </p><p>YEARS TO REPAY.  AMBASSADOR DUNBAR, NOTING THAT THE YEMENI </p><p>SIDE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE GSM PROGRAM, EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>YEMEN WAS IN ARREARS IN ITS PAYMENT ON PAST GSM PROGRAMS </p><p>AND THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IN TALKS FOR </p><p>BETTER TERMS WHILE THE ARREARAGES REMAIN.  PRESIDENT SALEH </p><p>SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY WOULD SETTLE ALL ARREARAGES </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  ALL WOULD BE PAID. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE SECRETARY REFERRED TO PRESIDENT SALEH\'S EARLIER </p><p>REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p>AND SAID THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THE GSM PROGRAM IN THAT </p><p>SPIRIT IF THE PRESIDENT CAN GET THE ARREARAGE ISSUE BEHIND </p><p>US.  ONCE THE ARREARAGES ARE PAID, WE WILL ASK THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY CAN BE MORE </p><p>FORTHCOMING IN THE TERMS THEY OFFERED.  PRESIDENT SALEH </p><p>SEEMED PLEASED AND SAID AGAIN THAT ALL ARREARS WILL BE </p><p>PAID.  HE QUIPPED THAT THE SOVIETS HAD A SIMILAR BUT MUCH </p><p>BIGGER PROBLEM WITH YEMEN.  "WE HAVE 2 BILLION DOLLARS IN </p><p>DEBTS TO THE SOVIETS WHICH WE RESCHEDULE EVERY YEAR.  NOW </p><p>THAT THEY ARE CAPITALISTS, IT WILL BE MUCH TOUGHER TO </p><p>RESCHEDULE."  "YOU WILL FIND MANY OF US," HE SAID, </p><p>"WISHING THEY HAD REMAINED SOCIALISTS:"  THE SECRETARY </p><p>SUGGESTED SALEH TRY TO GET SOVIET AGREEMENT TO PAY OFF THE </p><p>ENTIRE DEBT IN RUBLES BECAUSE THEN THE YAR COULD WIPE OUT </p><p>ITS DEBT IN ONE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>//INVESTMENT LAW// </p><p> </p><p>10. THE SECRETARY ASKED ABOUT THE STATUS OF YEMEN\'S  NEW </p><p>INVESTMENT LAW.  PRESIDENT SALEH SAID THE LAW WAS </p><p>PRESENTLY IN DRAFT.  HE DESCRIBED IT AS ONE OF THE BEST </p><p>INVESTMENT LAWS IN THE WORLD.  HE THANKED THE U.S. AND </p><p>SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR THEIR GREAT ASSISTANCE.  THE </p><p>LAW WILL SOON BE SENT TO PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL.  IN HIS </p><p>WORDS, EVERYTHING IS ON TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>11.
