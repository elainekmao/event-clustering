<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CU, GT, UNCHR </p><p>SUBJECT: VICE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO CUBA SPURS SPECULATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 317 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 511 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  A glowing press conference by Vice President </p><p>Reyes after an official visit to Cuba fueled speculation that </p><p>some in the GOG are reconsidering Cuba policy.  Reyes hinted </p><p>that Guatemala would abstain on the Cuba vote at the UNCHR, </p><p>did not rule out voting with Cuba, and said that he brought </p><p>an invitation from Castro for an official visit by President </p><p>of Congress Rios Montt.  The Ambassador had two separate </p><p>conversations with the Foreign Minister and President </p><p>Portillo (ref B).  Portillo said the FRG was reacting to </p><p>decertification; he promised a calm, rational decision on the </p><p>CUBA HR vote.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) After a seven-day official visit to Cuba and a </p><p>four-hour meeting with Castro, Vice President Reyes told </p><p>reporters on February 19 that Guatemala would do well to </p><p>emulate Castro\'s policies on education, medicine, tourism, </p><p>and agriculture.  Cheerfully handing out Cohiba cigars, the </p><p>Vice President spent nearly an hour extolling the virtues of </p><p>the Cuban system.  Although the Cuban budget for education is </p><p>smaller than Guatemala\'s, Reyes said Cuba accomplishes three </p><p>times as much with it.  Reyes went so far as to say that what </p><p>he had seen in Cuba almost made him want to move there </p><p>(opposition press cartoons depicted people taking up a </p><p>collection to pay his airfare).  Even before his departure, </p><p>Reyes recorded a national address that was broadcast during </p><p>his trip in which he expressed gratitude for the work of </p><p>Cuban doctors in Guatemala.  Reyes said Guatemala could solve </p><p>its medical problems if Guatemalan doctors were more like </p><p>their Cuban counterparts (Comment: Ex FonMin Orellana told </p><p>DCM that Cuba had asked Reyes to increase the GOG\'s payment </p><p>for Cuban Doctors). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Reyes was vague on the UNCHR vote.  In response to </p><p>direct questions, he refused to rule out voting with Cuba, </p><p>but hinted that an abstention would be a more likely outcome. </p><p> Reyes insisted that Castro never mentioned the issue in </p><p>their meeting. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Reyes said he found Rios Montt open to the possibility </p><p>of an official visit to Cuba when he conveyed Castro\'s </p><p>invitation.  Aristides Crespo, Secretary General of the FRG </p><p>party and right-hand-man to Rios Montt, has avoided the issue </p><p>except to deny speculation that a Cuba visit would hurt the </p><p>FRG\'s electoral prospects in the eyes of its largely </p><p>anti-Communist support base.  Reftel reports Crespo, on the </p><p>floor of Congress, calling for support of Cuba at the UNCHR. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We recently heard from the Foreign Ministry that a </p><p>March bilateral, usually held at the Vice-Minister level, has </p><p>been upgraded by the Ministry to a full Ministerial.  The </p><p>agenda will review "all aspects of the relationship." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) At a February 20 dinner that included Foreign Minister </p><p>Edgar Gutierrez, the Ambassador asked what is going on with </p><p>Vice President Reyes and his remarks praising the Castro </p><p>regime.  The Foreign Minister said he, too, had been </p><p>surprised by Reyes Lopez\' comments, and met with him to hear </p><p>about his trip to Cuba.  The Ambassador told Gutierrez that </p><p>the Vice President\'s remarks, especially about the UNCHR </p><p>vote, looked like an intentional poke in our eye driven by </p><p>pique over decertification.  He added that a Guatemalan </p><p>abstention in Geneva would undermine Guatemala\'s hard-won </p><p>credibility on human rights, and asked if the GOG was willing </p><p>to throw this away simply to annoy us.  Gutierrez </p><p>acknowledged that Reyes\' statements had been unhelpful, and </p><p>assured us that the GOG would consult us on the human </p><p>rights situation in Cuba before President Portillo makes any </p><p>decision on the UNCHR vote. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador reiterated these arguments to President </p><p>Portillo on February 25 (ref B).  Portillo candidly said the </p><p>FRG was flirting with CUBA to annoy the USG, due to </p><p>decertification (which hurts the FRG\'s electoral chances) and </p><p>perceived USG blocking of a Rios Montt candidacy.  The </p><p>Ambassador\' urged Portillo not to squander the prestige the </p><p>GOG had acquired in the last two years on Cuba and said the </p><p>USG would ask the GOG to vote yes on a Cuba human rights </p><p>motion.  Portillo was non-committal, but said the GOG would </p><p>make a decision after things had calmed down. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Cuba is not a significant domestic issue.  VP </p><p>Reyes\' flirtation with Cuba probably is in fact a poke in the </p><p>eye of the USG.  We will continue to engage the GOG on this </p><p>issue. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
