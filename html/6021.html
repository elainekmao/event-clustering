<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0056 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>FEBRUARY 26, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 26, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Tercuman: In its session on February 28, the </p><p>Turkish National Security Council is going to </p><p>evaluate the idea of declaring state of emergency </p><p>rule or martial law in Diyarbakir, Batman, </p><p>Mardin, Sirnak, Siirt, and Hakkari provinces in </p><p>order to prevent any kind of disorder that might </p><p>take place in the event of war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Evrensel: Although officially not declared, </p><p>the OHAL administration is in effect reinstated </p><p>in Diyarbakir. All the checkpoints that existed </p><p>during the OHAL period have been re-activated, </p><p>while special-team units and armored personnel- </p><p>carriers have been deployed in town. ID checks </p><p>are being conducted more frequently. Diyarbakir </p><p>inhabitants are unhappy about the reappearance of </p><p>these OHAL practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Milliyet/Turkiye/Tercuman/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Cumhuriyet: It is reported that Kurdish </p><p>leaders Mesut Barzani and Celal Talabani in </p><p>northern Iraq wrote a joint letter to President </p><p>Bush demanding that Turkish soldiers should not </p><p>be allowed to enter northern Iraq, and asked for </p><p>"urgent protection" from the US. The two Kurdish </p><p>leaders expressed in their letter that Turkey </p><p>aimed at diminishing the "democratic government" </p><p>formed in northern Iraq, and that there would be </p><p>clashes with Turkish soldiers if Turkish soldiers </p><p>came. </p><p>In Erbil, the Kurdish National Assembly decided </p><p>to oppose the presence of Turkish forces in </p><p>northern Iraq.  The Vice President of the IKDP </p><p>Group, Ahmet Salar, stated that "It is not </p><p>Turkey, but rather the Iraqi people and Iraqi </p><p>Kurds, who are responsible for the territorial </p><p>integrity of Iraq. We can provide our own </p><p>security." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  A commission to improve relations between </p><p>Turkey and Barzani\'s IKDP was formed by Iraqi </p><p>opposition groups. Cuneyt Mengun from the </p><p>Turcoman Front was also included in this </p><p>committee. After the commission\'s meeting with </p><p>Barzani, an anti-Turkish demonstration planned in </p><p>Erbil was ordered stopped by Mesut Barzani. Sami </p><p>Abdurrahman, an IKDP official, said they were not </p><p>as afraid of threat by Saddam as afraid of </p><p>Turkey. He said Saddam killed many Kurds, but </p><p>Turkey would kill Kurdish people\'s ambitions and </p><p>hopes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Hurriyet: Per the agreement between Turkey </p><p>and the United States, some 62,000 American </p><p>soldiers will be deployed in tent cities to be </p><p>set up in Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Malatya, </p><p>Batman, and Silopi. The American soldiers -- who </p><p>will come via Iskenderun port -- will be </p><p>concentrated in Gaziantep and then dispersed to </p><p>their stations via Sanliurfa highway, and </p><p>eventually enter northern Iraq through the Habur </p><p>border gate. It is reported that the US has </p><p>promised financing for the resurfacing of the </p><p>Gaziantep-Urfa highway after the conclusion of </p><p>the war. </p><p>The designated tent-city centers are: 1) </p><p>Gaziantep airport and its adjacent area, 2) </p><p>Malatya\'s Erhac airport and its adjacent area, 3) </p><p>Diyarbakir airport and its adjacent area, 4) </p><p>Mardin airport and its adjacent area, 5) Batman </p><p>airport and its adjacent area, 6) Silopi township </p><p>of Sirnak -- mainly to be used for soldiers who </p><p>arriving by sea via Iskenderun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet/Hurriyet/Turkiye/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Sabah/Radikal: </p><p>A 48,143 gross ton US Navy affiliate vessel named </p><p>"Capella" docked at Iskenderun port yesterday but </p><p>did not unload. After the Navy vessel, other </p><p>ships named "Gute" and "Rozana" also approached </p><p>the docks.  The American Delegation rented a 52- </p><p>bed capacity, fully equipped private hospital in </p><p>Batman. Fifteen doctors in various specialties </p><p>work at the hospital. The US delegation visited </p><p>some of the doctors in their private offices, </p><p>too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Turkiye: An Antonov-124 Russian cargo plane </p><p>brought Patriot missile ramps that will be </p><p>installed at Diyarbakir and Batman airports. The </p><p>teams who had come to Turkey for installing the </p><p>Patriot missile systems will start work in the </p><p>coming days. A military convoy of 40-50 vehicles </p><p>carrying five heavy cannons (mortars), three </p><p>ambulances, two cranes, and several trucks </p><p>traveled from Adana to the southeast yesterday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Cumhuriyet: Teachers Union\'s Diyarbakir </p><p>chapter president, Abdullah Demirtas, said </p><p>although the ratio of the schools constructed in </p><p>the region increased progressively the number of </p><p>students per classroom was still very high. He </p><p>said there was an average of 60-70 students in a </p><p>class, and their main problem was the shortage of </p><p>teachers.  Demirtas said 1200 teachers had been </p><p>appointed to the region, but because of </p><p>retirements and transfers there was still a big </p><p>shortage of teachers, and in some schools, they </p><p>had heating problems, and in addition there was a </p><p>need for another 1200 school janitors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Hurriyet: 26 persons charged of raping a 12 </p><p>year old poor girl were arraigned in a secret </p><p>session at the 1st Felony Court of Mardin. Two </p><p>women who allegedly were involved in trafficking </p><p>the girl were also charged. It is claimed that </p><p>the girl recognized all the persons who allegedly </p><p>raped her. The inmates apparently stated in their </p><p>interrogations that they were wealthy, reputable, </p><p>and mature persons living in Mardin and </p><p>Kiziltepe, and it was impossible for them to </p><p>attempt to do such a thing. They claimed that </p><p>they saw the girl at the court for the very first </p><p>time, and that in Mardin there was a mafia that </p><p>tried to extort money from them by blackmail. The </p><p>sub-governor\'s secretary -- who is one of those </p><p>accused of having raped the girl -- defended </p><p>himself saying that many people apply to his </p><p>office for assistance, and some people whom he </p><p>couldn\'t help may have tried to take their </p><p>revenge from him by such an accusation. The </p><p>hearing was adjourned to an unspecified date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Milliyet/Turkiye/Sabah: Because of heavy </p><p>rainfall in Reyhanli township of Hatay, the level </p><p>of water in the Asi River has swelled </p><p>dramatically and villages are flooded. Tayfur </p><p>Sokmen, Terzihoyuk, Kurtulmus, Cumhuriyet and </p><p>Karcancik villages are on stand-by for evacuation </p><p>should the water level rise even further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Radikal: The Bush Administration has chosen </p><p>Eric Edelman, Vice President Cheney\'s "prince," </p><p>to become the new U.S. Ambassador to Ankara. </p><p>Edelman, 51, who served as U.S. Ambassador to </p><p>Finland previously, is an expert on Russia.  He </p><p>will take up his posting this summer, pending the </p><p>Senate\'s confirmation of his nomination. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
