<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001487 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PRM (KENNELLY) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, SMIG, CA, CIC </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S INTENTIONS REGARDING SAFE THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>SIDE LETTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 123874 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In a meeting on May 23, officials with </p><p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada told poloffs that while </p><p>Canada is prepared to meet its commitments concerning the </p><p>resettlement of refugees under its Safe Third Country </p><p>Agreement with the United States, it will not begin to do so </p><p>until that agreement is fully implemented by the U.S. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Poloffs met on May 23 with Daniel Jean, Acting </p><p>Assistant Deputy Minister for Policy and Program Development </p><p>at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), and Bruce </p><p>Scoffield, Director of the Refugees Branch in Policy and </p><p>Program Development, to convey the points set out reftel. </p><p>While we had initially requested a meeting with CIC Deputy </p><p>Minister Michel Dorrais, we were referred to Acting ADM Jean. </p><p>Jean said Canada is prepared to set in motion the process </p><p>necessary to for resettlement of refugees referred to Canada </p><p>by the U.S., as proposed in the side letter to the Safe Third </p><p>Country agreement, once that agreement has been fully </p><p>implemented by the U.S. Jean said he had heard it will be </p><p>several months before the safe third regulations are </p><p>published in the U.S., and commented "we are becoming very </p><p>impatient" with this delay.  Jean complained that the U.S. </p><p>had asked Canada to take a number of actions following </p><p>September 11, and Canada had responded quickly to those </p><p>requests; the Safe Third Country agreement was the one thing </p><p>Canada asked of the U.S., and it has not yet been completed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) With respect to the issue of resettling interdicted </p><p>Cubans now located at Guantanamo, Jean indicated that GOC </p><p>views Guantanamo as Cuban territory, and therefore Canada </p><p>cannot accept such persons under current regulations as that </p><p>would constitute in-country processing for refugees. </p><p>Scoffield noted that third country nationals located at </p><p>Guantanamo, such as Haitians, can be resettled in Canada. </p><p>Referring to Michael Smith\'s May 19 letter to DAS Ryan, Jean </p><p>emphasized that Canada wants to see procedures set in place </p><p>for the referral of refugee cases by the U.S., and is ready </p><p>to meet with the U.S. to begin discussing such procedures. </p><p>Jean also stated that Canada would like to include the policy </p><p>implications of refugee resettlement in a broader dialogue </p><p>with the U.S. on humanitarian issues, another point made in </p><p>Smith\'s letter. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
