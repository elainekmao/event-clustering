On 8 April, the DART attended the Water/Sanitation </p><p>Sectoral Meeting, held at the UNDP Office in Kuwait City. </p><p>The DART also met with civil affairs representative and </p><p>UNICEF to discuss the water supply situation in Umm Qasr. </p><p>The following report is based on these meetings.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UNICEF\'S WATER STRATGEY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The United Nations Children\'s Fund\'s (UNICEF) strategy </p><p>for improving the water supply services in Umm Qasr does not </p><p>involve the direct use of the Coalition-built pipeline from </p><p>Kuwait.  This pipeline has the capacity of delivering up to </p><p>2,000,000 liters per day of potable water provided by the </p><p>Government of Kuwait (GOK).  At the pipeline terminus, the </p><p>water is supplied to tankers, 22 of which have been hired by </p><p>Coalition forces, for delivery within Umm Qasr and </p><p>surrounding areas.  The agreement with the GOK for the </p><p>supply of water expires at the end of May, and reportedly is </p><p>unlikely to be renewed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The UNICEF plan involves several objectives.  The first </p><p>is to provide potable water to Umm Qasr by tankering water a </p><p>distance of eight kilometers (km) from Kuwait to Umm Qasr. </p><p>UNICEF has hired four tankers of 38,000-liters capacity each </p><p>to bring the water to the Umm Qasr hospital and four other </p><p>locations in the town.  The hospital will have a 10,000- </p><p>liter bladder, while the other four locations will each have </p><p>a 20,000-liter bladder.  Tap stands will be erected at the </p><p>bladders to allow people to draw water for their personal </p><p>needs.  The water will be free.  It is expected that the </p><p>tankers will supply approximately 400,000 liters per day. </p><p>Additional bladders and tap stands will be installed if the </p><p>situation requires them. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The second objective (and first priority) of the UNICEF </p><p>plan is to restore the pre-war municipal piped water system. </p><p>This system consisted of a 75 km pipeline from Basrah to Umm </p><p>Qasr that supplied 2,000,000 liters of water per day to a </p><p>treatment plant, from which it was distributed through the </p><p>reticulation system to houses within the town.  The water </p><p>supplied by this system, although bacteriologically safe, </p><p>was non-potable because of high salinity.  As such, the </p><p>water was used in Umm Qasr for uses other than drinking. </p><p>Potable water was provided by two commercial factories </p><p>through private vendors.  The water treatment plant and the </p><p>two commercial factories were damaged by the war and the </p><p>subsequent looting that took place.  The overall restoration </p><p>of this piped system will require assessment and repair of </p><p>the pipeline from Basrah, repair of the treatment plant, and </p><p>repair of the piped reticulation system.  One constraint is </p><p>that the pipeline passes through currently non-permissive </p><p>areas, which means that neither UNICEF nor its non- </p><p>governmental organization (NGO) partners are allowed to </p><p>carry out the needed assessment at this time. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>DART LIAISON BETWEEN UNICEF AND CIVIL MILITARY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  At the Water/Sanitation Sectoral Meeting, held at the </p><p>United Nations Development Program\'s (UNDP) office in Kuwait </p><p>City on 8 April, a representative of USAID\'s Reconstruction </p><p>Team reported that USAID was willing to rebuild the </p><p>treatment plant and install desalinization equipment to make </p><p>the water potable.  UNICEF, which is currently prohibited </p><p>from working directly with agencies of the U.S. Government, </p><p>indicated that it would be delighted to see such an activity </p><p>take place.  At the close of the meeting, a DART </p><p>representative inquired whether UNICEF had any objections to </p><p>a U.S. Civil Affairs unit carrying out the necessary </p><p>technical assessment of the 75 km pipeline from Basrah and </p><p>then making the results available to UNICEF.  Again, UNICEF </p><p>replied that it would be pleased to receive such </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Also on 8 April, the DART met with Civil Affairs </p><p>representatives to discuss the assessment of the pipeline </p><p>with the civil affairs authorities.  The DART will make an </p><p>official request so that the official process for </p><p>authorization can start.  If no difficulties are </p><p>encountered, the assessment could begin within a couple of </p><p>days.  The DART pointed out to the Civil Affairs officers </p><p>that UNICEF cannot deal directly with the U.S. military and, </p><p>therefore, the DART would act as a liaison between UNICEF </p><p>and the military. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
