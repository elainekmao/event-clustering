<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 02299 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GOES ON THE WAGON </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IS PRESSING ITS </p><p>SOCIAL AGENDA ONCE AGAIN, BY TRYING TO BAN ALCOHOL. </p><p>THE MB PROBABLY KNOWS THAT THIS EFFORT WILL NOT </p><p>SUCCEED; MORE LIKELY, THE MOVEMENT IS CHAFING UNDER </p><p>THE BIN SHAKER GOVERNMENT\'S TIGHT REINS AND WANTS TO </p><p>FIGHT BACK, IF ONLY SYMBOLICALLY.  THE MB IS NOT </p><p>WITHOUT STRENGTH; THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT CANNOT </p><p>DIRECTLY CONFRONT THE IKHWAN ON "ISLAMIC" ISSUES LIKE </p><p>A PROHIBITION ON ALCOHOL.  BUT IT CAN -- AND LIKELY </p><p>WILL -- STUDY THE ISSUE TO DEATH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>NO INTENTION OF ALTERING THE ESSENTIALLY MODERATE </p><p>SOCIAL IMAGE OF JORDAN.  HOWEVER, WHILE IT IS WILLING </p><p>TO CONFRONT THE MB ON POLITICAL ISSUES LIKE THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, IT WILL TAKE A MORE SUBTLE ROUTE ON SOCIAL </p><p>MATTERS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTIES PUSHED THROUGH </p><p>PARLIAMENT FEBRUARY 15 A MOTION TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO DRAFT LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE PRODUCTION, SALE </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IN THE </p><p>KINGDOM.  THE MOVE WAS SUPPORTED BY 34 DEPUTIES </p><p>(INCLUDING THE MB AND INDEPENDENT ISLAMISTS), WITH NO </p><p>OBJECTIONS AND 20 ABSTENTIONS.  SEVERAL DEPUTIES LEFT </p><p>THE CHAMBER BEFORE THE VOTE.  THE DEBATE ENGENDERED </p><p>HARSH WORDS BETWEEN AN ISLAMIST DEPUTY AND TWO </p><p>PROMINENT LEFTISTS, ONE OF WHOM RETORTED, "FOR THOSE </p><p>WHO WANT AN ISLAMIC STATE, GO FORM ONE SOMEWHERE </p><p>ELSE."  HOWEVER, EVEN THESE DEPUTIES DID NOT OPPOSE </p><p>THE MOTION TO SEND THE ISSUE TO THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION TO A </p><p>BAN ON ALCOHOL, FEW DEPUTIES SPOKE AGAINST THE MOTION/ </p><p>REFLECTING THE GENERALLY CONSERVATIVE, MUSLIM NATURE </p><p>OF SOCIETY HERE.  AS ESTABLISHMENT DEPUTY ABD AL-RAUF </p><p>AL-RAWABDEH TOLD US FEBRUARY 20, NO DEPUTY WANTS TO BE </p><p>SEEN OPPOSING A MEASURE WHICH IS POPULARLY VIEWED AS </p><p>AN ISLAMIC DUTY.  RAWABDEH SAID HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IF </p><p>A POPULAR REFERENDUM ON PROHIBITION WERE HELD IN HIS </p><p>CONSTITUENCY OF IRBID, ALCOHOL WOULD BE BANNED.  THE </p><p>DETRIMENTAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS ON TOURISM AND FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT WOULD BE NO MATCH FOR A CITATION FROM THE </p><p>QUR\'AN. </p><p> </p><p>5. DESPITE HIS OPPOSITION TO PROHIBITION, RAWABDEH </p><p>VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION.  HE AND OTHER DEPUTIES </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE BEST SOLUTION WAS TO ALLOW THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO STUDY THE MATTER, WHICH IS ALL THE </p><p>IKHWAN WERE ASKING.  THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF </p><p>PROHIBITION WOULD BE INCLUDED IN SUCH A STUDY, AND THE </p><p>ISSUE WOULD BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES UNTIL IT WAS </p><p>FORGOTTEN.  IN THE MEANTIME, NO MUSLIM DEPUTY WOULD </p><p>OPEN HIMSELF UP TO CHARGES OF NOT BEING FAITHFUL TO </p><p>HIS RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE MB\'S RATIONALE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. THE MB\'S ANTI-ALCOHOL MOTION SYMBOLIZES THE GROUP\'S </p><p>CURRENT PREDICAMENT.  THE MB, MORE ASSERTIVE DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS MASRI GOVERNMENT, HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY </p><p>THE MORE POWERFUL BIN SHAKER GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO CLAMP DOWN ON MAJOR ISSUES LIKE THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>THE GROUP ALSO REALIZES THAT ITS 1989 IMAGE HAS BEEN </p><p>TARNISHED BY ITS LACK OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>AND IN THE BADRAN GOVERNMENT.  THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>MOTION IS THUS A MEANS OF RE-POLISHING THAT IMAGE </p><p>WHILE EMBARRASSING THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>7. WHETHER ALCOHOL IS ACTUALLY BANNED APPEARS TO BE A </p><p>SECONDARY PRIORITY FOR THE MB.  ONE EMBASSY CONTACT </p><p>WAS TOLD BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>COMMITTEE HANDLING THE ISSUE THAT MB DEPUTIES SEEMED </p><p>RELATIVELY DISINTERESTED IN PUSHING THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>BEGIN ITS STUDY.  ALTHOUGH THE PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE </p><p>THE AUTHORITY TO DRAFT THE LEGISLATION THEMSELVES, THE </p><p>MB HAS CHOSEN TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SO.  THIS </p><p>WINS THE BROTHERS SOME POINTS WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE </p><p>ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DRAFTING A MEASURE WHICH </p><p>COULD THEN BE ATTACKED FOR ITS IMPRACTICALITY OR </p><p>ECONOMIC INADVISABILITY.  INSTEAD, IT CAN SIT AND TAKE </p><p>POT SHOTS AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR DELAYING THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION CONSISTENT WITH THE </p><p>QUR\'AN.  THE MB REMEMBERS HOW MEASURES IT PROPOSED </p><p>WHILE IT HELD MINISTRIES UNDER THE BADRAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>LARGELY BROUGHT RIDICULE UPON THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SEGREGATED EDUCATION NEXT? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. WE HAVE RECEIVED AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT THE MB </p><p>IS ABOUT TO BRING BEFORE PARLIAMENT A REQUEST TO </p><p>SEGREGATE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIVERSITIES.  AGAIN, WE </p><p>SEE THE MOVE AS A POLITICAL PLOY RATHER THAN A REAL </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE THE MB\'S SOCIAL AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LONGER-TERM REACTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. THE GOVERNMENT HAS PREDICTABLY STAYED SILENT ON THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S ALCOHOL MOTION, PRESUMABLY PREFERRING TO </p><p>KILL IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.  HOWEVER, ONE CONTACT </p><p>TOLD US FEBRUARY 23 THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS NOT </p><p>AMUSED BY THE IKHWAN\'S TACTICS.  HE REPORTEDLY SENT A </p><p>MESSAGE BACK TO THE MB THAT THE GROUP SHOULD </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT "JORDAN IS NOT ALGERIA."  COMMENT: WE </p><p>CANNOT CONFIRM BIN SHAKER\'S ALLEGED REMARK, BUT IF HE </p><p>DIDN\'T SAY IT, HE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE MB\'S PARLIAMENTARY MOVES ARE DESIGNED TO </p><p>RESERVE FOR ITS MEMBERS THE ISLAMIC HIGH GROUND. </p><p>CENTRISTS HAVE LONG BEEN TELLING US THEY NEED TO PUT </p><p>UP CANDIDATES IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WHO CAN COMPETE </p><p>WITH THE IKHWAN IN STANDARDS OF ISLAMIC PIETY.  THE </p><p>CENTRISTS ARE BEGINNING TO GET A TASTE OF THE KINDS OF </p><p>ISSUES THEY WILL BE FACING IN THE NEXT CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KEENE </p><p></p></div>
