<p>S E C R E T MONTREAL 000979 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR CA/VO/L/C and INR/IC and SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2O13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KVPR, PINR, Terrorism </p><p>SUBJECT: TAMIL TIGERS FUND-RAISER IN MONTREAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Bernadette Allen, Principal Officer; Reasons </p><p>1.5 B and D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  A Local Canadian Law Enforcement </p><p>Source has informed Post that there will be a "Tamil </p><p>Olympics" the week of 28 July 20O3 in Montreal, </p><p>Quebec, Canada.  Source reports that this event is a fund </p><p>raiser for the Tamil Tigers Terrorist Organization (LTTE). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  According to the reliable source the "Tamil </p><p>Olympics" is a gathering of individuals of Sri Lankan </p><p>decent who now live in Canada.  The gathering includes many </p><p>activities including several sporting games, and attracts </p><p>Sri Lankans from all over Canada.  According to Source at </p><p>last year\'s "Olympics" individuals were prcssured into </p><p>"donating" gold jewelry and cash.  Local Law Enforcement </p><p>attempted to track the jewelry; however, according to </p><p>Source the jewelry passed through many individuals and the </p><p>trail was lost.  Local Law Enforcement believes that the </p><p>money derived from the jewelry was funneled to the LTTE. </p><p>Source also states that individuals were threatened with </p><p>violence to give money to various charities that Law </p><p>Enforcement believes funneled the money to the LTTE.  Local </p><p>Law Enforcement was not able to make any arrests because </p><p>the individuals involved in the extortion would not come </p><p>forward to talk to Law Enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Source also stated that his branch of Local Law </p><p>Enforcement was being pressured to "find something on the </p><p>LTTE soon because the (Canadian) Government wants to put </p><p>the LTTE on the (Canadian) list of Terrorist </p><p>Organizations."  Source stated that Local Law Enforcement </p><p>would have the "Olympics" under surveillance but added that </p><p>they have had significant problems infiltrating the local </p><p>Tamil groups in the past because they are a very tight- </p><p>knit, homogeneous group. </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
