<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 LIMA 12419 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:       PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PE </p><p>SUBJECT:    BETWEEN SENDERO AND THE GOP: </p><p>            LIFE ON LIMA\'S OUTER FRINGE </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  VILLA EL SALVADOR, A SHANTY TOWN </p><p>SUBURB OF LIMA, IS SYMBOLIC OF THE BATTLE </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SENDERO LUMINOSO </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE LOYALTIES OF A </p><p>POVERTY-STRIKEN POPULATION.  BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>LIMITED PRESENCE AND RESOURCES, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS DIFFICULTY RESPONDING TO THE SENDERO\'S </p><p>SELECTIVE CAMPAIGN OF TERRORISM OR THE </p><p>POPULATION\'S EXPECTATIONS.    END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SHINING EXAMPLE ON THE HILL: VILLA EL SALVADOR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  POLITICAL OFFICERS RECENTLY REVISITED VILLA </p><p>EL SALVADOR, LIMA\'S MOST SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT </p><p>"PUEBLO JOVEN" (PJ - LITERALLY YOUNG TOWN).  IT </p><p>IS A FAVORITE STOP ON THE POVERTY TOURISM ROUTE </p><p>IN PERU.  ONE OF THE LARGEST AND OLDEST </p><p>"SPONTANEOUS" SETTLEMENTS THAT RING METROPOLITAN </p><p>LIMA, "VILLA" IS WIDELY CONSIDERED THE </p><p>PROTOTYPICAL SUCCESS STORY OF WHAT A SQUATTER </p><p>INVASION CAN BECOME THROUGH COMMUNITY </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND HARD WORK.  VILLA LIES IN </p><p>LIMA\'S SOUTHERN CONE AND IS HOME TO ABOUT THREE </p><p>HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PERSONS.  FOUNDED </p><p>TWENTY-ONE YEARS AGO, VILLA HAS GENERALLY MADE </p><p>THE TRANSITION FROM A SQUATTERS SHANTY TOWN TO A </p><p>POOR WORKING CLASS "BEDROOM COMMUNITY" WITH AN </p><p>AIR OF SETTLED PERMANENCE:  MANY HOMES AND </p><p>BUSINESSES ARE MADE OF BRICK OR CEMENT BLOCK; </p><p>ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE 90 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>TOWN\'S HOMES HAVE TELEVISION; THE MAIN STREET </p><p>AND MANY SIDE STREETS ARE PAVED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DAILY STRUGGLE FOR </p><p>EXISTENCE LIVED BY MOST INHABITANTS OF LIMA\'S </p><p>SHANTY TOWNS, RESIDENTS OF VILLA EL SALVADOR ARE </p><p>GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE WELL OFF.  THE </p><p>COMMUNITY IS ORGANIZED BY SECTIONS, AND ELECTED </p><p>DELEGATES TO THE UMBRELLA VILLA EL SALVADOR </p><p>SELF-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION ("CUAVES") HAVE </p><p>FOUGHT HARD, AND WITH SOME SUCCESS, TO OBTAIN </p><p>ELECTRICITY, WATER, SEWAGE AND GARBAGE </p><p>COLLECTION FOR MANY PARTS OF VILLA.  VILLA\'S </p><p>HARD WORK AND SOLID ORGANIZATION (AND </p><p>CONSIDERABLE INTERNATIONAL LARGESSE) EARNED IT </p><p>AN OFFICIAL COMMUNITY CHARTER AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RECOGNITION IN THE FORM OF A "PRINCE OF </p><p>ASTURIAS" AWARD FROM SPAIN\'S CROWN PRINCE </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HOWEVER, LIFE IN VILLA IS BY NO MEANS EASY. </p><p>VILLA RESIDENTS MUST PAY A MINIMUM OF 0.50 SOLES </p><p>(1.36 SOLES CURRENTLY EQUALS 1 U.S. DOLLAR) FOR </p><p>THE CHEAPEST BUS TRANSPORTATION TO LIMA. </p><p>PRINCIPAL WAGE EARNERS, WHO AVERAGE PERHAPS 10 </p><p>SOLES A DAY IN EARNINGS, SPEND AT LEAST 10 </p><p>PERCENT OF THAT ON TRANSPORTATION.  THE RANKING </p><p>POLICE SERGEANT ON DUTY AT VILLA\'S ONLY POLICE </p><p>STATION TOLD POLITICAL OFFICERS THAT ON HIS </p><p>OFFICIAL SALARY OF 7 SOLES A DAY HE MUST PROVIDE </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF, HIS WIFE AND FOUR </p><p>CHILDREN.  CLAIMING THAT HIS COLLEGE-AGE SON </p><p>NEEDED THE EQUIVALENT OF 3 SOLES A DAY TO ATTEND </p><p>THE UNIVERSITY, AND HIS PRINCIPAL LUNCHEON MEAL </p><p>MIGHT COST TWO SOLES, HE SHRUGGED WHEN HE ASKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY HOW HE WAS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>REST OF HIS FAMILY ON THE REMAINDER OF HIS LEGAL </p><p>SALARY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO THE POLICE OFFICIAL, </p><p>ABSENTEEISM IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF VILLA EL </p><p>SALVADOR WAS RAMPANT BECAUSE FAMILIES IN THE </p><p>TOWN WERE REQUIRED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN OUT TO </p><p>WORK AT AN EARLY AGE RATHER THAN TO SCHOOL.  IN </p><p>ANY EVENT, THE POLICE SERGEANT DISMISSED MOST OF </p><p>THE TEACHERS IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS </p><p>UNDER-QUALIFIED AND UNDER-MOTIVATED OUTSIDERS. </p><p>MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE EQUALLY LIMITED. </p><p>RESIDENTS DEPRECATED THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO THEM, NOTING THAT THE NEAREST </p><p>HOSPITAL WAS NOT ONLY DISTANT, BUT NOT EVEN </p><p>FULLY FUNCTIONING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WITH UNCERTAINTY OVER THE VALUE OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL CURRENCY, THE DOLLAR HAS BECOME THE </p><p>PREFERRED MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE FOR TRANSACTIONS IN </p><p>VILLA EL SALVADOR.  CITY OFFICIALS ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT BUSINESSES OR HOUSES ON THE TOWN\'S MAIN </p><p>STREET SOLD FOR 4,000-5,000 DOLLARS, WITH PRIME </p><p>CORNER LOCATIONS GOING FOR AS MUCH AS </p><p>TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.  ALL TRANSACTIONS </p><p>ARE IN DOLLARS.  ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF PERU\'S </p><p>MONEY SUPPLY IS IN DOLLARS. </p><p> </p><p>PROBLEMS IN CAMELOT: SENDERO WITHIN THE GATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  SENDERO LUMINOSO IS TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE </p><p>TOWN\'S GOVERNMENT.  THREE FACTORS SUPPOSEDLY </p><p>MADE THE TOWN IMPENETRABLE TO THE SENDERO </p><p>TERRORISTS:  THE LEADERSHIP\'S CLOSE TIES TO THE </p><p>POPULATION, THEIR LINKS WITH TRADITIONAL PARTIES </p><p>OF THE LEFT, THE TOWN\'S COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURE, AND ITS LEVEL OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  FOREIGN AID TO VILLA EL SALVADOR, </p><p>AS A "MODEL SLUM," WAS ALSO HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  HOWEVER, VILLA\'S REPUTATION AS A REDOUBT </p><p>AGAINST SENDERO WAS LITERALLY EXPLODED WITH THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF VICE-MAYOR MARIA ELENA MOYANO </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 15.  NEXT, VILLA\'S CITY HALL AND </p><p>POLICE STATION WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY DESTROYED </p><p>BY A SENDERO LUMINOSO CAR BOMB ON APRIL 8, </p><p>1992.  ALSO DAMAGED IN THE ATTACK WERE NEARBY </p><p>BUILDINGS INCLUDING A COMPLEX HOUSING A SCHOOL </p><p>AND VILLA\'S COMMUNITY RADIO AND TELEVISION </p><p>STATION.  IN ADDITION, IN 1992 AN SL-ASSOCIATED </p><p>SLATE ALSO LEGITIMATELY WON AN ELECTION IN THE </p><p>MICRO-INDUSTRIAL PARK TO REPRESENT THE PARK IN </p><p>VILLA\'S GOVERNMENT.  PERUVIAN SENDERO EXPERT </p><p>CARLOS TAPIA SUBSEQUENTLY DESCRIBED VILLA EL </p><p>SALVADOR AS A SHINY APPLE THAT CUT OPEN REVEALED </p><p>ITSELF TO HAVE BEEN INFESTED WITH SENDERO WORMS. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE RARELY VENTURE INTO THE CITY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  POLITICAL OFFICERS VISITED THE SHELL OF THE </p><p>STILL FUNCTIONING POLICE STATION.  THERE ARE </p><p>SOME 70 POLICEMEN WORKING IN THREE SHIFTS FOR </p><p>THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.  ACCORDING TO THE SENIOR </p><p>POLICE SERGEANT INTERVIEWED, POLICE ONLY VENTURE </p><p>OUT OF THE STATION IN PAIRS, HAVE NO VEHICLES </p><p>(THEIR PATROL CARS WERE DESTROYED BY THE CAR </p><p>BOMB), AND HAVE NO TELEPHONE.  THE POLICE </p><p>OFFICIAL REPORTED THAT IT COULD TAKE UP TO AN </p><p>HOUR FOR ANY REINFORCEMENTS TO ARRIVE ONCE THEY </p><p>HAD BEEN REQUESTED USING THE ONE RADIO LINK </p><p>AVAILABLE AT THE STATION.  SINCE AT LEAST A </p><p>DOZEN POLICE GUARD THE MUNICIPAL CENTER AT ALL </p><p>TIMES, AT BEST ONE OR TWO PATROLS ARE AVAILABLE </p><p>FOR RESPONDING ON FOOT TO ASSISTANCE CALLS FROM </p><p>THE COMMUNITY AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  ALTHOUGH THERE </p><p>ARE SCHOOLS WITHIN SIGHT OF THE POLICE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS, THE OFFICIAL INDICATED THAT NO </p><p>COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO STUDENTS WAS ACTIVE OR </p><p>CONTEMPLATED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE POLICE IN VILLA EL SALVADOR HAVE LITTLE </p><p>EXPECTATION OF REINFORCEMENTS FROM LIMA IN THE </p><p>EVENT OF TROUBLE, AND AT LEAST ONE POLICEMAN </p><p>ADMITTED TO A MODUS VIVENDI WITH SENDERO.  THE </p><p>OFFICER TOLD POLOFFS THAT HE LIVED IN VILLA WITH </p><p>HIS FAMILY -- SENDERO KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW </p><p>THEM.  HE EXPLAINED THAT WHILE HE OFTEN HAD </p><p>FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH "THEM" ABOUT CURRENT </p><p>EVENTS, HE AVOIDED PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATES AND </p><p>SAID BOTH SIDES "KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THINGS" </p><p>BETWEEN THEM. </p><p> </p><p>VILLA\'S LEADERS STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  MICHEL AZCUETA, FOR TWENTY YEARS THE MAYOR </p><p>OF VILLA EL SALVADOR, ESTIMATED THAT IN THE AREA </p><p>OF VILLA EL SALVADOR PROPER AND THE ADJOINING </p><p>SHANTY TOWN, THE SENDERO LUMINOSO HAS BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A MAJOR PRESENCE WITH PERHAPS 7-10 </p><p>ACTIVIST MEMBERS AND APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY </p><p>ACTIVE SYMPATHIZERS IN THE COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>FUJIMORI REMAINS POPULAR </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  AZCUETA, WHO WAS ELECTED IN 1989 ON AN </p><p>OPPOSITION SLATE AS A LIMA CITY COUNCILMAN, </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED PERUVIAN PRESIDENT FUJIMORI </p><p>RETAINED HIS POPULARITY WITH THE RESIDENTS OF </p><p>THIS OUTLYING COMMUNITY.  FUJIMORI\'S PRINCIPAL </p><p>APPEAL, IN AZCUETA\'S VIEW, WAS HIS CAREFULLY </p><p>CULTIVATED IMAGE AS A "NON-POLITICIAN."  THE </p><p>INHABITANTS OF HIS TOWN, REMARKED AZCUETA, WERE </p><p>FED UP WITH POLITICIANS AND TRADITIONAL POLITICS </p><p>SINCE THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL STRUCTURES AND </p><p>PROCESSES HAD PRODUCED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF </p><p>CONCRETE BENEFITS FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL AND MAYORAL ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>14.  AZCUETA DEMURRED WHEN ASKED IF HE PLANNED </p><p>TO BE A CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  HE WAS UNCERTAIN WHO MIGHT </p><p>RUN, NOTING THAT A LIKELY TACTIC OF THE SENDERO </p><p>LUMINOSO GUERRILLAS WOULD BE TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ASSASSINATION </p><p>AGAINST LOCAL CANDIDATES IN OUTLYING AREAS WHILE </p><p>USING CAR BOMBINGS IN LIMA FOR THEIR PROPAGANDA </p><p>VALUE.  ATTACKS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS, IN ADDITION </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATING THE GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO </p><p>PROVIDE LOCAL CANDIDATES AND OFFICIALS WITH </p><p>PROTECTION WOULD HAVE SEVERAL EFFECTS, IN </p><p>AZCUETA\'S VIEW.  IN ADDITION TO ADVANCING THE </p><p>SENDERO STRATEGY OF SHOWING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IMPOTENCE, RANDOM ASSASSINATIONS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>DETER THE BEST CANDIDATES FROM SEEKING OFFICE. </p><p>THE RESULT, IN AZCUETA\'S VIEW, WOULD BE </p><p>SECOND-BEST OR MEDIOCRE CANDIDATES TAKING THEIR </p><p>PLACE.  SUCH A GROUP OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS UNABLE </p><p>TO RESOLVE PERU\'S PROBLEMS, OR EXACERBATE THEM, </p><p>WOULD FIT INTO THE SENDERO\'S STRATEGY, CONCLUDED </p><p>AZCUETA. </p><p> </p><p>15. COMMENT:  VILLA EL SALVADOR ILLUSTRATES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S DIFFICULTIES IN FIGHTING SENDERO </p><p>LUMINOSO.  THE RELATIVE PROSPERITY THAT BRINGS </p><p>TELEVISION ALSO BRINGS THE RISING EXPECTATIONS </p><p>OF GOOD LIFE OF THE "TELENOVELAS" DEPICTED ON </p><p>THE SOAP OPERAS AND DEMANDS FOR SERVICES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROVIDE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY A LIMITED </p><p>PRESENCE IN A TOWN WHICH IS PART OF THE </p><p>CAPITAL\'S METROPOLITAN AREA, PERHAPS 45 MINUTES </p><p>FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  WHAT CONTACT THE </p><p>AVERAGE RESIDENT OF VILLA EL SALVADOR HAS WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVE, I.E., </p><p>THE TAX COLLECTOR COLLECTING MONEY OR THE </p><p>POLICEMAN DEMANDING A BRIBE.  SENDERO IS </p><p>CAPITALIZING ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S LIMITED </p><p>PRESENCE BY PICKING AND CHOOSING TARGETS OF </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>FROM THE PEOPLE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>SELF-HELP AND LOCAL INITIATIVE OF THE RESIDENTS </p><p>OF VILLA EL SALVADOR SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE </p><p>WITHOUT, OR DESPITE, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SENDERO IN VILLA EL SALVADOR IS FIGHTING TWO </p><p>ENEMIES: LOCAL LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SENDERO HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE HEADWAY IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  EVEN THOUGH THE ARREST OF SENDERO LUMINOSO </p><p>FOUNDER AND LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>12 MAY TEMPORARILY DISRUPT THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>OPERATIONS, THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS--POVERTY, </p><p>ECONOMIC STAGNATION, RACISM, UNRESPONSIVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT--UPON WHICH IT HAS FED REMAIN.  AND </p><p>EVEN IF VILLA EL SALVADOR TURNS THE CORNER, TE </p><p>NEXT WAVE OF POTENTIAL SYMPATHIZERS, NOW SITTING </p><p>ON THE SAND HILLS ABOVE THE TOWN IN CARDBOARD </p><p>HOUSES, WILL ALREADY BE DEMANDING ITS SHARE OF </p><p>THE ECONOMIC PIE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUAINTON## </p><p></p></div>
