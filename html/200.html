<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ATHENS 04106 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, GR, KPRP </p><p>SUBJECT:  GREECE:  1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) STATE 42378; (B) STATE 54439; </p><p>-     (C) STATE 54781; (D) 87 ATHENS 4694 </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>1.  GREECE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING 1987 GREECE CONTINUED TO BE THE SCENE </p><p>OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS, SPONSORED BOTH BY DOMESTIC </p><p>AND FOREIGN GROUPS.  TWO ATTACKS WERE DIRECTED </p><p>SPECIFICALLY AGAINST AMERICANS.  THE EXTREME-LEFT </p><p>GREEK "NOVEMBER 17TH" TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>(ACTIVE SINCE 1975 AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>PREVIOUS KILLINGS OF TWO U.S. OFFICIALS) CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMBINGS ON APRIL 24 AND </p><p>AUGUST 10 OF BUSSES TRANSPORTING U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL IN THE ATHENS AREA.  IN BOTH CASES </p><p>AMERICANS WERE INJURED, BUT FORTUNATELY THERE WERE </p><p>NO FATALITIES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THESE ATTACKS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>3.  SYMPTOMATIC OF THE NATURE OF THE TERRORIST </p><p>PROBLEM IN GREECE WERE THE KILLING OF A KUWAITI </p><p>BUSINESSMAN JANUARY 7 BY UNKNOWN BUT PROBABLY </p><p>MIDDLE EASTERN ASSAILANTS, THE SHOOTING WITH </p><p>INTENT TO INJURE SERIOUSLY OF A PROMINENT GREEK </p><p>NEUROSURGEON BY THE "NOVEMBER 17TH" ORGANIZATIOM </p><p>FEBRUARY 4, THE SHOOTING AND SERIOUS WOUNDING OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE GREEK CONFEDERATION OF </p><p>WORKERS ON JUNE 24, THE SHOOTING WITH OBVIOUS </p><p>INTENT TO KILL OF AN ARAB LEAGUE DEPUTY ON </p><p>DECEMBER 21 (ALSO BY PROBABLE MIDDLE EASTERN </p><p>ASSAILANTS), AND A NUMBER OF BOMBINGS WITHOUT </p><p>APPARENT INTENT TO ENDANGER LIFE BY THE </p><p>"REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLES\' STRUGGLE" ORGANIZATION </p><p>("ELA"), INCLUDING A BOMB ATTACK SEPTEMBER 27 AT </p><p>THE U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARY IN CENTRAL ATHENS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>4.  OFFICIAL EFFORTS NOTWITHSTANDING, THE </p><p>CONTINUANCE OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY ON GREEK SOIL </p><p>DURING 1987 HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>SUCCESSES IN POLICE COUNTER-TERRORIST EFFORTS. </p><p>THE MOST STRIKING SUCCESS ENJOYED BY THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES DURING THE YEAR WAS A VIOLENT </p><p>ENCOUNTER WITH A SMALL GROUP OF TERRORISTS ON </p><p>OCTOBER 1 WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ONE AND </p><p>THE ARREST OF TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH THE "ANTI-STATE </p><p>STRUGGLE" GROUP.  HOWEVER, DESPITE ACTIVE POLICE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS EVENT, NO </p><p>FURTHER ARRESTS HAVE YET TAKEN PLACE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, GREEK AUTHORITIES </p><p>CONTINUED DURING 1987 THE EFFORTS THEY HAD </p><p>INITIATED EARLIER TO IMPROVE SECURITY AT AIR AND </p><p>SEA PORTS OF ENTRY (PARTICULARLY IN THE </p><p>ATHENS-PIRAEUS AREA), TO IMPROVE SURVEILLANCE OF </p><p>SUSPECTED FOREIGN TERRORISTS, TO ENHANCE THE </p><p>TRAINING AND CAPABILITIES OF POLICE FORCES </p><p>DEDICATED TO FIGHTING TERRORISM AND TO IMPROVE </p><p>COORDINATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES.  PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS HAS BEEN </p><p>COMMENDABLE, ALTHOUGH THERE REMAINS COMSIDERABLE </p><p>ROOM FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT.  THE GREEK </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS GENERALLY BEEN RESPONSIVE TO U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR PROTECTIVE SECURITY FOR </p><p>ITS PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES LOCATED IN GREECE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS AN AMBIVALENT </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM AS AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL POLICY PROBLEM.  GREECE REMAINS THE </p><p>ONLY MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WHICH DOES </p><p>NOT CONDEMN STATES WHICH SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  IT CONTINUES TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS </p><p>FOR "PROOF" OF STATE COMPLICITY AND TO INTRODUCE </p><p>SO-CALLED "NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES" INTO ITS </p><p>DECISIONS ON TERRORIST EVENTS WHICH VIRTUALLY </p><p>PRECLUDE EITHER ANY CONDEMNATION OF THOSE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE OR ANY ACTION LIKELY TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>FURTHER SUCH ACTIVITIES.  GREEK RELUCTANCE TO TAKE </p><p>A MORE ACTIVE POSITION AGAINST STATE-SPONSORED </p><p>TERRORISM IS BASED ON A POLICY WHICH APPARENTLY </p><p>DEFINES SOME TERRORIST ORGANIZATIOMS AS </p><p>"JUSTIFIABLE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS". </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  DURING THE PERIOD JUNE-AUGUST 1987 THE UNITED </p><p>STATES GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GREEK GOVERNMENT ABOUT ITS CONCERNS RELATING TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SPECIFICALLY TO </p><p>REPORTS OF CONTACTS BETWEEN GREEK OFFICIALS AND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABU NIDAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION (WHICH WERE PUBLICLY AND VEHEMENTLY </p><p>DENIED BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT).  THIS DIALOGUE, </p><p>WHILE CONFIDENTIAL, SERVED TO ENHANCE THE </p><p>AWARENESS OF GREEK AUTHORITIES TO THE DEPTH OF </p><p>AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT TERRORIST ISSUES. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>8.  GREECE RECOGNIZES THE PALESTINE LIBERATION </p><p>ORGANIZATION WHICH MAINTAINS AN ACCREDITED </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN ATHENS.  WHILE THE PLO HAS </p><p>ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE RHETORICAL SUPPORT IN GREECE </p><p>(FROM ALL MAJOR POLITICAL FACTIONS), THERE IS NO </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THE GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS ASSISTED </p><p>THE PLO OR ANY OF ITS CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS IN THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THERE IS ALSO NO </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT GREECE HAS EXTENDED SUPPORT TO ANY </p><p>OTHER ORGANIZATION INVOLVED IN TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>9.  THERE WERE NO JUDICIAL RESPONSES TO TERRORIST </p><p>CASES INVOLVING AMERICANS IN GREECE DURING 1987, </p><p>LARGELY BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ARRESTS OF </p><p>PERPETRATORS DURING THE YEAR.  ON OCTOBER 6 AN </p><p>IMPRISONED MEMBER OF THE "ARMEMIAN SECRET APMY FOR </p><p>THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA" ("ASALA"), VAHE </p><p>KHODAVERDIAN, WAS RELEASED FROM GREEK PRISON AND </p><p>DEPORTED.  HE HAD BEEN SERVING A TEN YEAR </p><p>SENTENCE, WHICH HE SUCCESSFULLY APPEALED WITH A </p><p>CONSEQUENT REDUCTION TO A TERM OF TWO YEARS WHICH </p><p>AMOUNTED TO TIME SERVED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE UNITED STATES MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE </p><p>OFFICIAL DIALOGUE WITH GREEK AUTHORITIES ON ALL </p><p>ASPECTS OF TERRORIST-RELATED ISSUES AND IT SEEKS </p><p>TO ASSIST THE GREEK GOVERNMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE </p><p>IN ITS COUNTER-TERRORIST EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>KEELEY </p><p></p></div>
