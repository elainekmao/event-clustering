<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PARTIAL TEXT OF 6/2/02 GEN MALU INTERVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Para 2 contains an excerpt from a June 2, 2002 interview </p><p>given by dismissed Chief of Army Staff  Samuel Victor Leo </p><p>Malu to  "This Day" newspaper. His May 27  testimony before </p><p>the Commission investigating last October\'s violence in Benue </p><p>(to which Malu family members and property fell victim) had </p><p>placed the outspoken Malu in the public eye once more and the </p><p>interview in "ThisDay" sought to capitalize on his currency. </p><p>A friend to controversy and ally of unfounded statements, </p><p>Malu makes good copy for Nigeria\'s sensationalist press. </p><p>Malu claims Obasanjo fired him because he opposed Operation </p><p>Focus Relief (OFR) while Obasanjo favored the program to </p><p>curry favor with the USG.  Malu also alleges  OFR was a USG </p><p>pretext to collect intelligence about the Nigeria military. </p><p>In another gross misrepresentation, Malu claimed Ambassador </p><p>Jeter wrote a report that stated Nigeria\'s peacekeeping </p><p>performance in Liberia was better than what U.S. units could </p><p>have done. While his rancor was directed mostly at Obasanjo, </p><p>Malu tried to cause us collateral damage, still holding a </p><p>grudge at our perceived role in his removal.  Most </p><p>knowledgeable Nigerians realize they must take Malu\'s </p><p>statements with a grain of salt.  For example, because of the </p><p>ample media coverage given OFR, Malu\'s statement that OFR\'s </p><p>purpose has never been divulged, rings patently untrue. </p><p>However, Nigerians who dislike the U.S. will choose to </p><p>believe Malu , not because he is right but because they want </p><p>to. </p><p>2.   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q:   Now can you situate this incident with your relationship </p><p>with President Obasanjo when you were chief of army staff? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A:   Yes, I opposed President Obasanjo on a lot of issues, </p><p>and this was not because I was being rude.  The man is my </p><p>commander in chief.  I was the professional head of the army </p><p>and had to advise him on matters relating to the army.  He </p><p>can claim to have been a General and I do not grudge him </p><p>about it.  But when you look at the whole thing, Obasanjo </p><p>served for eighteen years and got to the rank of General, I </p><p>served thirty three years and got to the same rank.  If you </p><p>know the history of my army commands you will know that I did </p><p>not get the rank as some kind of favor.  So if at that stage, </p><p>I could not advise on the service that I was heading, then he </p><p>needed to find a stooge.  I could not just go and say "yes </p><p>sir" to everything because he was my commander in chief.  I </p><p>should have an imput particularly with things that border on </p><p>the country\'s security especially with the coming of the </p><p>Americans. Till today, President Obasanjo has not explained </p><p>what those people came to do.  But I will tell you that they </p><p>came to gather intelligence that they could not get through </p><p>the years especially during the period of the late General </p><p>Abacha.  They could have got some through sattelite but not </p><p>much. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They needed to know how a third world country with all such </p><p>sanctions on it by then succeeded in peace keeping operations </p><p>where the superpower Americans can not.  And they came, we </p><p>gave them this information.  Nobody is afraid America will </p><p>attack us, they will not do that.  But in international </p><p>relations, you do not have permanent friends but permanent </p><p>interests. America can use a country like Republic of Benin </p><p>to embarrass us so badly when it pleases them.  Because this </p><p>man believes it was America that gave him the presidency, he </p><p>decides everything should be given to them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the case of peace keeping operations in Liberia, the </p><p>present American Ambassador to Nigeria, Howard Jeter, was in </p><p>Liberia by then as their representative to the Liberian </p><p>crisis.  If you see the report he wrote to the American </p><p>government and advised them that if they wanted to assist a </p><p>few third world countries with regional bodies like ECOMOG, </p><p>they should not bother about giving them troops, but should </p><p>give them logistics and they will excel as we did in Liberia. </p><p> He even went further to say that what we did in Liberia was </p><p>beyond anybody\'s comprehension and that he does not think </p><p>American Army would have done that.  Because he saw what we </p><p>did.  We opened roads, and were working with machetes, </p><p>cutlasses.  Roads that had not been used in eight years, so </p><p>that electioneering and free movements could be achieved.  My </p><p>soldiers became like labourers.  But as a mission we tasked </p><p>ourselves and we had to do it.  That is why, if I go to </p><p>Liberia now, they treat me like a head of state, it is not as </p><p>if they like me.  I used to use the most foul language on </p><p>them. They hated my guts, but they respected me. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment.  The report by Ambassador Jeter that Malu refers </p><p>to possibly was one written several years ago for a </p><p>presentation Ambassador Jeter made at a conference on </p><p>regional peacekeeping. The report commended ECOMOG for its </p><p>efforts and recognized its valuable contribution to the peace </p><p>process in Liberia.  However, the report also mentioned </p><p>ECOMOG shortcomings and that the international community had </p><p>to provide assistance so that ECOMOG could adequately </p><p>implement its mandate.  What the report did not do was state </p><p>that the Nigerian army\'s peacekeeping capabilities were </p><p>superior to the U.S army\'s. That claim can be solely </p><p>attributed to the butcher of Odi\'s inflated ego and gross </p><p>disregard for the truth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The following contains some commentary from the </p><p>accompanying front page article. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo removed him from office last year mainly to </p><p>curry favor from the United States.  He fell out of favor </p><p>from the President following his (Malu\'s) persistent </p><p>opposition to the presence of the United States military team </p><p>that was drafted to Nigeria for what he called unexplained </p><p>reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Till today, President Obasanjo has not explained what those </p><p>people came to do.  But I will tell you that they came to </p><p>gather intelligence that they could not get through the years </p><p>especially during the period of the late General Sani Abacha. </p><p> They needed to know how  a third world with all such </p><p>sanctions on it by then succeeded in peace keeping operations </p><p>where the superpower Americans can not.  "And they came, we </p><p>gave them this information.  Nobody is afraid America will </p><p>attack us, they will not do that. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Advancing more arguments to support his opposition of the </p><p>presence of the United States Military on the country, he </p><p>said: "America can use a country like Republic of Benin to </p><p>embarrass us so badly when it pleases them.  Because this man </p><p>believes it was America that gave him the presidency, he </p><p>decides everything should be given to them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
