(C) PRESIDENT MUGABE RECEIVED ME DECEMBER 13 FOR A </p><p>ONE HALF-HOUR FAREWELL CALL.  WHILE THE ATMOSPHERICS OF </p><p>THE MEETING WERE GOOD AND LIGHT, I DID MANAGE TO </p><p>INTERRUPT THE START OF A TIRADE AGAINST THE BRITISH BY </p><p>ADVANCING THE ARGUMENT THAT MUGABE SHOULD TO GIVE UNDP </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN\'S INITIATIVE A CHANCE </p><p>AND TO REMAIN OPEN TO IT (REF).
