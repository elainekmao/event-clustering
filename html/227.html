<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BAGHDAD 04587 </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR MARSH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN-IRAQ: EVE OF GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) BAGHDAD 4454  (B) STATE 270576 </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA HAVING CONCEDED </p><p>TO IRAN WHAT IT WANTED MOST, I.E., A CEASE-FIRE, </p><p>AND THEY ARE, WE SUSPECT, DUBIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY </p><p>THINK OHEZ CAN GET OUT OF THE TALKS.  THEY WANT </p><p>ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION (INCLUDING WARSHIPS) </p><p>WITHOUT INSPECTION BY IRAN; NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN; </p><p>NO VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL COMMITTEE ACCUSING IRAQ; </p><p>CLEAR DEMARCATION OF LAND BORDERS; AND ULTIMATELY, </p><p>A PEACE TREATY WHICH GUARANTEES THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF ALL, . NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS (INCLUDING WITHDRAWAL OF SUPPORT OF KURDS). </p><p>THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE IRAQIS PROBABLY DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT A CLERICAL REGIME, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI </p><p>DIES, CAN BE ANYTHING BUT EXPANSIONIST/REVOLUTIONARY, </p><p>SO THAT NO PEACE TREATY WOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN THE </p><p>LONG RUN. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA IN A QUANDARY.  THEY HAVE </p><p>ALREADY CONCEDED TO IRAN THE MAIN THING IRAN WANTED </p><p>RIGHT NOW, I.E.,  CEASE-FIRE -- A BREATHING SPACE </p><p>JUST WHEN IRAQ HAD TURNED THE TABLES MILITARILY. </p><p>THEY MADE THIS CONCESSION PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF </p><p>NEARLH UNAH </p><p>YUNCOLDS OVER IRAN IS MILITARY </p><p>THREAT, AND THE REPUBLICAN GUARD CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>MASSED OPPOSITE ABADAN AS A POTENT WARNING TO IRAN. </p><p>BUT THE JUBILANT CELEBRATIONS ALL OVER IRAQ MAKE IT </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE PRINCIPAL DETERMINANT OF WHETHER THE IRAQIS </p><p>WILL BE FORTHCOMING OR OBSTRUCTIONIST AT GENEVA IS </p><p>THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE KEY ISSUE: IS IRAN REALLY </p><p>INERESTED IN COMPJEHENSIVE PEACE?  WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE IRAQIS THEMSELVES DO WANT A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE. </p><p>FOR ALL THEIR PRESENT MILITARY ADVANTAGE, WE DOUBT </p><p>THAT THEY ENTERTAIN NOTIONS OF MILITARY CONQUEST </p><p>OF IRAN.  THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH </p><p>IRAN AND THAT IN TIME THE TABLES MAY TURN BACK THE </p><p>OTHER WAY AGAIN, WITH IRAN RESURGING IN STRENGTH </p><p>MILITARILY AND ECONOMICALLY.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE </p><p>GAINED THE UPPER HAND WITH THE KURDS, THEY BADLY </p><p>NEED A GUARANTEE OF NONSUPPORT OF THE KURDS FROM </p><p>IRAN.  BUT FOR ALL THEIR YEARNING FOR A GENUINE </p><p>PEACE, WE DOUBT LHAHTHE IRAQIS ARE NAIVE ENOUGH </p><p>TO BELIEVE THAT ANY CLERICAL REGIME IN IRAN, EVEN </p><p>AFTER KHOMEINI DIES, WILL RENOUNCE THE REVOLUTION </p><p>OR ITS INTEGRAL ELEMENTS, EXPANSIONISM AND INTER- </p><p>FERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, </p><p>PRINCIPALLY IRAQ\'S. </p><p> </p><p>5. IF THIS ASSESSMENT IS CORRECT, WE PREDICT THAT </p><p>EVEN THOUGH TARIQ AZIZ EMPHATICALLY WANTS TO AVOID </p><p>A LONG PERIOD OF "NO PEACE, NO WAR" (ALONG THE LINES </p><p>OF THE POST-1948 ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE), THE IRAQIS </p><p>WILL NOT BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO BE FORTHCOMING </p><p>IN THE GENEVA TALKS, SINCE A PEACE TREATY WOULD </p><p>NOT IMPEL THE IRANIANS TO SCALE DOWN THEIR LONG- </p><p>TERM REVOLUTIONARY AMBITIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THERE ARE A SERIES BF ULTIMATE GAINS THE IRAQIS </p><p>MIGHT AIM FOR, INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>-- ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION IN THE GULF/HORMUZ/ </p><p>SHATT, INCLUDING FOR WARSHIPS WITHOUT INSPECTION </p><p>OR HINDRANCE BY IRAN.  THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POINT </p><p>WAS ALREADY MADE CLEAR TWO DAYS AFTER IRAN\'S </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF 598 IN TARIQ AZIZ\'S JULY 20 LETTER, </p><p>OVER HALF OF WHICH WAS DEVOTED TO THE ISSUE OF </p><p>NAVIGATION.  THE IRAQIS EMPHASIZE IT NOT ONLY </p><p>BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT, </p><p>BUT BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS A TEST OF IRANIAN </p><p>INTENTIONS.  AT A BASER LEVEL, THEY MAY ALSO WANT </p><p>TO DRIVE THIS POINT HOME AS A WAY TO EMBARRASS </p><p>IRAN; </p><p> </p><p>-- DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES AS VOUCHSAFED </p><p>IN PREVIOUS TREATIES INCLUDING THE ALGIERS ACCORD, </p><p>WHICH IRAN FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON.  THE IRAQIS </p><p>NOW OCCUPY ZAYN AL-QAWS, SAIF SA\'D, AND THE OTHER </p><p>TINY SECTORS (ONLY 356 SQ. KM. ALL TOLD), MAKING </p><p>THEIR POSITION NOT ONLY LEGALLY (##) </p><p>MISSION OFFICIALS SPENT </p><p>FOUR YEARS FINDING EVER MORE INGENIOUS WAYS TO AVOID </p><p>THE DEMARCATION, AND SO IRAN CONTINUED TO HOLD ZAYN </p><p>AL-QAWS, SAIF SA\'D, AND THE OTHER POCKETS.  DDING </p><p>TO IRAQI ANGER IS THE FACT THAT IRAN SHELLED BORDER </p><p>TOWNS IN SEPTEMBER 1980 FROM THESE POCKETS -- </p><p>INDEED, THE IRAQIS ARGUE THAT THAT SHELLING WAS THE </p><p>IMMEDIATE TRIGGER OF THE WAR; </p><p> </p><p>-- CANCELLATION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD INSOFAR AS </p><p>CONCERNS THE SHATT, I.E., RETURN OF SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>TO IRAQ OVER THE ENTIRE RIVER COURSE.  THE IRAQIS </p><p>HAVE LEFT THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OPEN AT PRESENT, </p><p>SAYING THAT THE SHATT SHOULD BE CLEARED FOR UTILI- </p><p>ZATION BY BOTH PARTIES AND SPEAKING INFORMALLY OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.  BUT IF THE IRANIANS DO </p><p>NOT COME FORWARD ON THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER </p><p>THE ACCORD, BOTH IN REFERENCE TO NONINTERFERENCE </p><p>AND DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES, THE IRAQIS WILL </p><p>CERTAINLY NOT CONCEDE ON SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL THE </p><p>RIVER.  (THEY MAY NOT CONCEDE AT ALL.); </p><p> </p><p>-- NO NEGATIVE VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY.  WE </p><p>THINK THE IRAQIS UNDERSTAND FULL WELL THAT NO COM- </p><p>MITTEE WILL EVER GIVE IRAQ A POSITIVE VERDICT -- </p><p>THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE A "NONVERDICT" </p><p>THAT IMPUGNS BOTH SIDES OR ONE THAT BLAMES IRAQ </p><p>FOR STARTING THE WAR.  THE IRAQIS HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>EXUDED CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF AN </p><p>IMPARTIAL BODY SET UP TO EXAMINE THE GENERALIZED </p><p>ISSUE OF "RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR," AS OPPOSED </p><p>TO THE NARROW QUESTION OF "WHO STARTED THE WAR" </p><p> </p><p>-- INDEED, THE IRAQIS CALLED FOR SUCH AN IMPARTIAL </p><p>INQUIRY AS FAR BACK AS 1982.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY </p><p>ARE NOT EAGER FOR SUCH AN INQUIRY AND INSIST ON </p><p>EXAMINATION OF ISSUES IN 598 IN STRICT SEQUENTIAL </p><p>ORDER; </p><p> </p><p>-- NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN.  A YEAR AGO IF IRAN HAD </p><p>ACCEPTED 598, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL-PLACED, WITH </p><p>MAJNUN AND FAW IN ITS POSSESSION, TO DEMAND BILLIONS </p><p>OF DOLLARS WORTH OF REPARATIONS.  NOW THEY HAVE </p><p>LOST THEIR LEVERAGE.  THE IRAQIS WILL BE UNWILLING </p><p>TO ADMIT THE CONCEPT OF REPARATIONS, AND THEY WILL </p><p>WANT RECONSTRUCTION FOR ONE SIDE TO BE BALANCED BY </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION FOR THE OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>6. IMPORTANT AS THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES ARE FOR IRAQ, </p><p>THE MOST IMPORTANT, AND MOST ELUSIVE, IS AN ASSURANCE </p><p>OF NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, MEANING </p><p>NONSUPPORT FOR THE KURDS AND THE SHI\'A.  THE IRAQI </p><p>MFA STRESSES TO DIPLOMATS THAT KHOMEINI\'S BREACH </p><p>OF THIS SINGLE ISSUE IN THE ALGIERS ACCORD IS THE </p><p>BASIS FOR IRAQI INSISTENCE THAT IRAN HAS (DE FACTO) </p><p>ABROGATED THE AGREEMENT.  IT WAS THE ASSURANCE OF </p><p>NONINTERFERENCE THAT PROMPTED THE IRAQIS -- SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN AS THE PARTY\'S VICE-CHARIMAN AND SA\'DUN </p><p>HAMMADI AS FOREIGN MINISTER -- TO SWALLOW THEIR </p><p>PRIDE IN 1975 AND AGREE TO GIVING UP FULL SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>OVER THE SHATT, SOMETHING THAT IRAQ, AND BEFORE IT </p><p>THE OTTOMANS, HAD ALWAYS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED UPON. </p><p>(IRAQ, UNLIKE IRAN, HAS ONLY A TINY COAST AND VIEWS </p><p>THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES RIVER SYSTEMS AS ITS OWN, </p><p>NOTE BY OC/T: (##) OMISSION IN TEXT CORRECTION TO FOLLOW... </p><p>COMPLETELY NON-PERSIAN.)  THE SHAH\'S AGREEMENT </p><p>TO NONINTERFERENCE IN 1975 HAD A STUNNINGLY IMMEDIATE </p><p>IMPACT -- MULLA MUSTAFA BARZANI FLED TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES WITHIN WEEKS AND THE SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>IRANIAN SUPPORT COMPLETELY DEVASTATED THE </p><p>KURDISH INSURGENCY -- AND A SIMILAR RESULT WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY OCCUR NOW.  HOWEVER, WHILE THE PRESENT </p><p>IRANIAN REGIME HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING THE APPLICABILITY </p><p>OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD TO THE SHATT AL-ARAB, IT HAS </p><p>BREATHED NOTHING  ABOUT ITS OWN PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION </p><p>UNDER THE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. ANOTHER GOAL -- PARTICULARLY TRICKY -- FOR IRAQ </p><p>WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT INTERNATIONAL STRICTURES ON </p><p>SUPPLY OF ARMS TO IRAN CONTINUE AND THAT WESTERN </p><p>FLEETS CONTINUE IN PLACE IN THE GULF.  IRAQ IS </p><p>OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL-PLACED TO PRESSURE EXTERNAL </p><p>POWERS.  THE FACT MAY NOT BE LOST ON THE IRAQIS </p><p>THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IS TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR REMAINS IN THE HEADLINES OF </p><p>THE WORLD MEDIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST WAY TO </p><p>DO THAT IS TO OBSTRUCT THE GENEVA PROCESS AND, </p><p>INDEED, TO RENEW HOSTILITIES.  IRAQ WANTS TO BE </p><p>CAREFUL NOT TO DO THIS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BECOME </p><p>ISOLATED OR HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY POINT </p><p>A FINGER DIRECTLY AT IRAQ AS THE CONTINUER OF THE </p><p>WAR. </p><p> </p><p>8. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER, IRANIAN OBJECTIVES </p><p>AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE, ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM </p><p>IRAQ\'S: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IRANIANS HAVE THE CEASE-FIRE; THE TRICK FOR </p><p>THEM NOW IS TO MAINTAIN IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, </p><p>GIVING AS LITTLE AWAY AS POSSIBLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- THEIR IDEA OF A "COMPREHENSIVE PEACE" IS SIMPLY A </p><p>NONAGGRESSION PACT.  IN MAHALLATI\'S MOST RECENT </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT (TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW AUGUST 20, </p><p>FBIS NC2008073888) THE ONLY SPECIFIC POINT HE MEN- </p><p>TIONED THAT IS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE GENEVA TALKS </p><p>IS "STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT RENEWED </p><p>AGGRESSION." </p><p> </p><p>-- REASSERTION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD ONLY IN REGARD </p><p>TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SHATT, I.E., BOUNDARY AT THE </p><p>THALWEG, WITHOUT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS ON NONINTER- </p><p>FERENCE OR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS; </p><p> </p><p>-- INSISTENCE ON RIGHT TO INSPECT ALL VESSELS IN THE </p><p>GULF AND TO CONFISCATE ALL WAR-RELATED MATERIEL, </p><p>INCLUDING SEIZING WARSHIPS; </p><p> </p><p>-- VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY (WHICH THE IRANIANS </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO HAVE STACKED WITH PARTIES OF THEIR </p><p>CHOOSING) COMPLETELY IN IRAN\'S FAVOR; </p><p> </p><p>-- MASIVE REPARATIONS ONLY TO IRAN; </p><p> </p><p>-- PERIOD OF QUIET IN WHICH THE WORLD FORGETS ABOUT </p><p>IRAN AND IRAQ, THE WESTERN FLEETS GO HOME, STRICTURES </p><p>ON ARMS DELIVERIES ARE LIFTED. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE IRANIAN CONCEPT OF THE DIRECT TALKS AT GENEVA </p><p>IS ALREADY BECOMING CLEAR.  AS MUCH AS THE IRANIANS </p><p>PURPORT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SECRETARY GENERAL IS </p><p>COMPLETELY ON THEIR SIDE, THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE </p><p>PLAIN LANGUAGE IN HIS AUGUST 8 LETTER, SENT IDENTICALLY </p><p>TO BOTH TEHRAN AND BAGHDAD: "BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE </p><p>AGREED THAT DIRECT TALKS SHALL BE HELD UNDER MY </p><p>AUSPICES TO REACH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER </p><p>PROVISIONS OF RESOLUTION 598."  TO THE CONTRARY, IN </p><p>THE IRANIAN VIEW (AGAIN, MAHALLATI\'S AUGUST 20 IN- </p><p>TERVIEW), "THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS BEEN GRANTED </p><p>THE RIGHT TO INVITE BOTH SIDES TO TALK ONLY ABOUT </p><p>ARTICLE 4 OF THE RESOLUTION, AND NOT THE TOPICS </p><p>INCLUDED IN ARTICLES 1-8."  ARTICLE 4 DEALS WITH </p><p>"ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES," I.E., THOSE NOT SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ADDRESSED IN THE RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>10. ANOTHER ELEMENT CALLING FOR PESSIMISM ABOUT THE </p><p>HARMONIOUS PROGRESS OF TALKS IN GENEVA IS IRAQ\'S </p><p>DEEP DISTRUST OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  WELL AWARE OF </p><p>THIS DISTRUST, THE SYG MIGHT HAVE MOVED QUICKLY TO </p><p>FIND A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, </p><p>BUT HE HAS NOT YET DONE SO, AND INSTEAD HE IS SEEN </p><p>AS JEALOUSLY GUARDING LEADERSHIP OF THE PROCESS IN </p><p>HIS OWN HANDS AND OF ONE SUBORDINATE, GIANNI PICCO </p><p>(WHOM THE IRAQIS HAVE ALSO TAKEN A DISLIKE TO, </p><p>APPARENTLY).  RECRIMINATIONS ROSE TO A CRESCENDO </p><p>DURING THE PAST WEEK, WITH THE IRAQIS BELIEVING </p><p>THE SYG WAS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE A FORESHADOWING OF </p><p>HIS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, INCLUDING A REFERENCE TO </p><p>THE ALGIERS ACCORD.  THE SYG HAS ALLOWED HIMSELF </p><p>TO APPEAR TO BE ARGUING THE IRANIANS\' BRIEF, WITH </p><p>INCALCULABLE DETRIMENT TO HIS STANDING AS AN IMPARTIAL </p><p>ASSISTANT TO THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>11. INITIAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES IN GENEVA -- NOT TO </p><p>MENTION SUBSTANCE -- ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFICULT. </p><p>THE IRAQIS WILL REACT SHARPLY TO ANY SUGGESTIONS </p><p>ON PROCEDURE THAT APPEAR TO BE IMPOSED BY THE SYG. </p><p>THEY WILL PROBABLY INSIST THAT EVEN THE MOST MUNDANE </p><p>MATTERS OF PROCEDURE BE WORKED OUT DIRECTLY BY THE </p><p>TWO PARTIES.  THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT A PREARRANGED </p><p>AGENDA -- IN THEIR EMPHASIS ON STRICT SEQUENTIALITY, </p><p>THE IRAQIS HAVE SIGNALED THAT AN AGENDA IS NOT "MERE" </p><p>PROCEDURE FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>12. FOR DCM MARSH IN GENEVA: AN EXCELLENT CONTACT </p><p>IN THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL BE DR. RIYAD AL-QAYSI. </p><p>(AMBASSADOR HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM THIS EVENING, </p><p>AUGUST 23, JUST BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE.)  HE HAS BEEN </p><p>THE FOREMOST INTERNATIONAL JURIST IN THE IRAQI MFA </p><p>FOR OVER A DECADE.  WHILE OFFICIALLY HE IS DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OFFICE, HE </p><p>HAS BEEN WORKING FULL TIME FOR OVER A YEAR ON </p><p>BUILDING THE IRAQI LEGAL CASE FOR THE IMPARTIAL </p><p>COMMITTEE (IF IT IS EVER ESTABLISHED) AND FOR ALL </p><p>OTHER MATTERS IN 598; HE KNOWS     EVERY ASPECT, </p><p>DOWN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL, OF THE CENTURIES- </p><p>OLD BORDER/SHATT DISPUTE.  QAYSI HAS A SHARP MIND </p><p>AND IS AN ENGAGING INTERLOCUTOR, ALTHOUGH HE CAN </p><p>BE OVERLY LEGALISTIC.  AS DEPARTMENT HAS INFORMED </p><p>YOU, THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL ALSO INCLUDE PERMANENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE KITTANI AND AMBASSADOR ANBARI.  MFA </p><p>HAS INFORMED US THAT ANBARI WAS ASSIGNED TO THE </p><p>IRAQI DELEGATION BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LEGAL BACKGROUND </p><p>(ANOTHER LAWYER -- THE IRAQIS WILL BE FULLY PREPARED </p><p>TO BE STICKLERS, AS THE NEED ARISES). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
