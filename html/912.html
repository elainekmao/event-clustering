<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 MEXICO 011061 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO HERMOSILLO </p><p>TIJUANA </p><p>MERIDA </p><p>MATAMOROS </p><p>GUADALAJARA </p><p>NUEVO LAREDO </p><p>CIUDAD JUAREZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 11/17/2006 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, ECON, PINR, KDEM, MX </p><p>SUBJECT: PAN UNVEILS LEGISLATIVE, REFORM </p><p>AGENDAS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY MINISTER COUNSELOR FOR </p><p>POLITICAL AFFAIRS VAL MARTINEZ.  REASON 1.5 </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY: ON NOVEMBER 7, 1997, </p><p>NATIONAL ACTION PARTY (PAN) PRESIDENT FELIPE </p><p>CALDERON UNVEILED THE PAN\'S LEGISLATIVE </p><p>AGENDA FOR THE COMING YEAR, AS WELL AS ITS </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR REFORM OF THE STATE.  THE PAN\'S </p><p>AGENDA CLOSELY MIRRORS THE PARTY\'S MORE THAN </p><p>FIFTY YEAR PURSUIT OF INCREASED FEDERALISM IN </p><p>MEXICO, DECENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>AUTHORITY, AND EMPOWERMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROPOSAL </p><p>CONTAINS ELEMENTS INTENDED TO RAISE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S PROFILE IN CONGRESS AND INCREASE ITS </p><p>ATTRACTION TO LOWER INCOME VOTERS, WHILE NOT </p><p>RUNNING COUNTER TO THE BUDGETARY AND REFORM </p><p>GOALS OF ITS MAJOR "ALLY" IN THE CHAMBER, THE </p><p>PARTY OF THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION (PRD). </p><p>THE PAN GOAL OF REDUCING TAXES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THE VALUE ADDED TAX FROM 15 TO 12 PERCENT, IS </p><p>NOT UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED EVEN IN THE PAN AND </p><p>IS PROBABLY NEGOTIABLE.  INTERESTINGLY </p><p>ENOUGH, NONE OF THE PAN\'S 33 FEDERAL SENATORS </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE UNVEILING OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>AGENDA.  A FORMER PAN CONGRESSMAN TOLD POLOFF </p><p>NOVEMBER 14 THAT COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN THE PARTY\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN BOTH HOUSES IS LACKING, </p><p>THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTS IN THE OTHER MAJOR </p><p>PARTIES AS WELL (THE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY PARTY (PRI) AND THE PRD), AND </p><p>THAT SOME TYPE OF MECHANISM -- PERHAPS </p><p>CONFERENCE COMMITTEES-- MUST BE ESTABLISHED </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES TO ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>REFORM OF STATE EVENTUALLY PROSPERS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PAN: RAISING ITS PROFILE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON NOVEMBER 7, PAN PRESIDENT FELIPE </p><p>CALDERON AND PARTY LEADERS FROM THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES UNVEILED TO REPORTERS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATS THE PAN\'S LEGISLATIVE AND REFORM OF </p><p>STATE PROPOSALS FOR THE 57TH CONGRESS.  PAN </p><p>COORDINATOR IN THE CHAMBER AND PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE RULES COMMITTEE, CARLOS MEDINA, AND SUB- </p><p>COORDINATOR FOR SOCIAL POLICY, FRANCISCO JOSE </p><p>PAOLI BOLIO, OUTLINED THE PARTY\'S LEGISLATIVE </p><p>AGENDA FOR THE COMING YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE PRESENTATION FOLLOWED A FLURRY OF </p><p>ACTIVITY BY CALDERON IN RECENT WEEKS TO RAISE </p><p>AND DISTINGUISH THE PAN\'S PROFILE FROM ITS </p><p>GOVERNING ALLY IN THE CHAMBER, THE PRD. </p><p>CALDERON INITIALLY TRADED BARBS WITH THE </p><p>PRD\'S SHARP-TONGUED COORDINATOR IN THE </p><p>CHAMBER, PORFIRIO MUNOZ LEDO.  HE THEN </p><p>SOUNDED THE NEED FOR A BROAD CONSENSUS IN </p><p>STATE REFORM TO ACHIEVE FULL DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>SHARED COFFEE WITH PRD PRESIDENT -- AND MUNOZ </p><p>LEDO RIVAL-- ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR. </p><p>MOST RECENTLY, CALDERON MET WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>ZEDILLO AT HIS LOS PINOS RESIDENCE, IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE UNSETTLED DISPUTE BETWEEN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION IN THE CHAMBER AND THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>BRANCH OVER WHETHER ZEDILLO OR SECRETARY OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT EMILIO CHAUYFFET SHOULD LEAD </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH CONGRESS OVER REFORM OF THE </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE PAN BUDGETARY AND REFORM </p><p>PROPOSALS APPARENTLY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE </p><p>MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES.  WHILE PAN DOGMAS OF </p><p>GREATER FEDERALISM AND DECENTRALIZATION OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT ARE HONORED, THE PARTY ALSO </p><p>PROPOSES MEASURES TO INCREASE ITS POPULARITY </p><p>WITH SECTORS THAT HAVE RARELY IDENTIFIED WITH </p><p>THE PAN:  LOWER INCOME MEXICANS AND </p><p>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES.  IN ADDITION, AND DESPITE </p><p>CALDERON\'S EFFORTS TO BURNISH THE PAN\'S </p><p>PROFILE, THE PROPOSAL APPEARS CAREFULLY </p><p>TAILORED TO AVOID RUPTURING THE DELICATE </p><p>COOPERATION ACHIEVED IN THE CHAMBER, NOT ONLY </p><p>WITH THE PRD, BUT WITH THE LABOR PARTY (PT) </p><p>AND ECOLOGICAL GREEN PARTY (PVEM) AS WELL. </p><p>THE PAN PROPOSALS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>PAN\'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: GREATER FEDERALISM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

(U)  DURING THE PRESENTATION MEDINA AND </p><p>PAOLI BOLIO STRESSED THAT THE PAN\'S SOCIAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC PROPOSALS ARE ROOTED IN OVER </p><p>FIVE DECADES OF PROPOSALS BY THE PARTY IN </p><p>CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>THE PARTY\'S STRATEGIC FOCUS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) CONGRESSIONAL DEPUTY JUAN MIGUEL </p><p>ALCANTARA SORIA, DEPUTY COORDINATOR UNDER </p><p>MEDINA FOR POLITICAL AND JURIDICAL ISSUES, </p><p>OUTLINED THE PAN\'S STRATEGIC FOCUS FOR THE </p><p>57TH LEGISLATURE. </p><p> </p><p>PROMOTING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRACY </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.

(U)  THE PAN WANTS TO ACHIEVE AN </p><p>INCLUSIVE, ORDERED, AND DIGNIFIED SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BY: </p><p> </p><p>-- PROMOTING THE PAN INITIATIVE TO PROMULGATE </p><p>A NEW FEDERAL LABOR LAW THAT REEVALUATES AND </p><p>ENRICHES SALARIES; IMPROVES WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR WOMEN; ESTABLISHES SOCIAL </p><p>JUDGES WITH JUDICIAL AUTHORITY; MAKES </p><p>POSSIBLE JOINT-EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP OF </p><p>BUSINESSES, BEGINNING WITH 2.5 PERCENT OF A </p><p>PARTICULAR ENTERPRISE; IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>JURIDICAL STRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>COMMISSION OF MINIMUM SALARIES MUST BE </p><p>REVISED. </p><p> </p><p>-- ADDRESSING IN A COMPASSIONATE AND </p><p>EFFICIENT FASHION RURAL PROBLEMS, KEEPING IN </p><p>MIND THESE INVOLVE ISSUES OF HUMAN DIGNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- ADDRESSING PROBLEMS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES </p><p>AND COMMUNITIES, WITH THE GOAL OF PRESERVING </p><p>THEIR IDENTITY, CULTURE, AND RIGHTS THROUGH </p><p>NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND LEGAL </p><p>MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ESTABLISHING A NEW POLICY OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY THAT PROMOTES CITIZEN PARTICIPATION </p><p>AND EDUCATION TO FIGHT CRIME; TIMELY </p><p>ATTENTION SHOULD BE GUARANTEED TO CRIME </p><p>VICTIMS, AS WELL AS EFFICIENT PROSECUTION AND </p><p>SOCIAL REHABILITATION OF CRIMINALS. </p><p> </p><p>-- DETAINING THE CONSTANT INCREASE IN FUEL </p><p>PRICES THROUGH APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- CREATING THE JURIDICAL BASES NECESSARY TO </p><p>END PRIVATE OVER-INDEBTEDNESS, WITH A </p><p>TRANSPARENT DISTRIBUTION OF THE COSTS BETWEEN </p><p>DEBTORS, INVESTORS, BANKS AND THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) COMMENT: OBVIOUSLY THE PAN\'S BLUE </p><p>PRINT FOR REFORM IS SUBJECT TO DEBATE AND </p><p>COMPROMISE, BOTH INSIDE AND OUT OF THE PARTY. </p><p>GUANAJUATO GOVERNOR VICENTE FOX, A SELF- </p><p>PROCLAIMED CANDIDATE FOR THE PARTY\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN 2000, DISAGREES </p><p>WITH THE PARTY\'S POSITION TO CUT TAXES.

DIAZ NOTED THAT DIFFERENCES </p><p>EXIST BETWEEN THE REFORM AGENDAS OF THE PAN </p><p>AND THE PRD, BUT THAT THESE ARE "NUANCES" AND </p><p>ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE.  BOTH, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>PROPOSE DOUBLING RESOURCES FOR COMBATING </p><p>POVERTY AND INCREASING SPENDING ON EDUCATION </p><p>AND HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) POLOFF NOTED TO DIAZ THAT NONE OF </p><p>THE PAN\'S 33 SENATORS PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF THE PARTY\'S PROPOSAL.  DIAZ </p><p>INDICATED THAT LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN PARTY REPRESENTATIVES IN </p><p>THE CHAMBER AND THE SENATE IS A PROBLEM, ONE </p><p>THAT EXISTS FOR THE OTHER MAJOR PARTIES AS </p><p>WELL (THE PRD AND PRI).  THIS IS AN ISSUE </p><p>THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CREATION </p><p>OF A MECHANISM LIKE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE TWO HOUSES OF </p><p>CONGRESS ARE CONTROLLED BY DIFFERENT PARTIES </p><p>OR COALITIONS, THE PRI IN THE SENATE, AND THE </p><p>PRD, PAN, PT, AND PVEM IN THE CHAMBER.  DIAZ </p><p>ADDED THAT LITTLE, IF ANY, PROGRESS WOULD BE </p><p>MADE ON REFORM OF THE STATE MATTERS BETWEEN </p><p>NOW AND YEAR\'S END, WITH CONGRESS\' FOCUS </p><p>CLEARLY RESTING ON DEBATING AND APPROVING THE </p><p>BUDGET.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BRAYSHAW </p><p></p></div>
