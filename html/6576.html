<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/ERIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS POSTURING FOR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 480 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On March 19, the Ambassador met with Kul Chandra </p><p>Gautam, Deputy Executive Director with UNICEF in New York, </p><p>and a Nepali visiting the country for personal and </p><p>professional reasons.  Gautam related a conversation with the </p><p>Maoists\' second-in-command regarding the latter\'s desire for </p><p>a constituent assembly and his expectations for the form it </p><p>should take.  Gautam\'s conversation is reflective of the </p><p>Maoists\' ongoing charm offensive, in which they are trying to </p><p>project the image of a democratic party.  As reported in </p><p>reftel, however, there is no evidence the Maoists have </p><p>abandoned their basic goal of gaining power in Nepal at the </p><p>head of a communist, single-party state.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Content Is Less Important than Form </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On March 19, the Ambassador met with Kul Chandra </p><p>Gautam, Deputy Executive Director with UNICEF in New York, </p><p>and a Nepali visiting the country out of personal and </p><p>professional concerns.  Gautam described his meetings with a </p><p>range of political leaders, including phone calls with Maoist </p><p>second-in-command, Baburam Bhattarai, about the political </p><p>future of Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Gautam, Bhattarai stated that the </p><p>process for resolving Nepal\'s conflict is as important as the </p><p>content of the final resolution.  Even if the King issued a </p><p>"progressive" constitution, in doing so he would undermine </p><p>the people\'s sovereignty, Bhattarai argued.  Gautam reported </p><p>Bhattarai\'s contention that resolution of Nepal\'s domestic </p><p>conflict can come only through a constituent assembly. </p><p>Bhattarai claims the Maoists are on a winning streak. </p><p>However, the Maoist leadership cannot satisfy the demands of </p><p>its cadres with promises of only amendments to the present </p><p>constitution.  For Maoist leaders to satisfy their followers, </p><p>they must persuade the government to accede to a sovereign </p><p>constituent assembly.  (Note:  The term "sovereign" was not </p><p>defined during the discussion and could refer either to the </p><p>people\'s sovereignty as defined by the existing constitution </p><p>or to an agreement that the conclusions of the constituent </p><p>assembly have sovereign status.) </p><p> </p><p>Maoists as Supposed Defenders of Democracy? </p><p>=========================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) As reported by Gautam, Bhattarai expects elections to </p><p>be held for representation to a constituent assembly.  During </p><p>the campaign, all parties, including the Maoists, should be </p><p>allowed to compete on their respective platforms.  For the </p><p>Maoists, this includes calling for the establishment of a </p><p>communist republic.  Bhattarai, according to Gautam, stated </p><p>that if the Maoists\' vision is not accepted by the people </p><p>during the constituent assembly elections, they will abide by </p><p>the will of the people.  Gautam\'s own opinion is that all </p><p>parties should contest constituent assembly elections because </p><p>that mechanism would either resolve the conflict through </p><p>democratic means or serve to "call the Maoists\'s bluff." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The conversation related by Gautam appears to reflect </p><p>part of an ongoing charm offensive by the Maoists to improve </p><p>their stature as a legitimate political party--a strategy </p><p>made necessary by their loss of public support due to their </p><p>violent excesses over the past year.  Gautam\'s contact with </p><p>Bhattarai provides insight into the Maoists\' political </p><p>strategy, particularly in light of evidence that they </p><p>continue to pursue their fundamental goal of the creation of </p><p>a communist republic (reftel).  Bhattarai\'s promise to abide </p><p>by the electorate\'s free choice of delegates to a constituent </p><p>assembly is credible only as a tactic to curry favor among </p><p>political party leaders, human rights advocates, and the </p><p>international community.  By reaching out to political </p><p>parties, in particular, the Maoists may hope to muster enough </p><p>support in a constituent assembly to engineer a new </p><p>constitution that would marginalize the monarchy and make the </p><p>army susceptible to Maoist infiltration and eventual control. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
