SUMMARY:  THE ARAB SUMMIT IN SHARM EL-SHEIKH RECEIVED PRIMARY </p><p>AND EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL MEDIA.  NEWS REPORTING AND </p><p>EDITORIALS CRITICIZED THE ARAB SUMMIT FOR NOT INCLUDING SHEIKH </p><p>ZAYID\'S PLAN FOR IRAQ IN ITS FINAL RESOLUTION.  EDITORIALS </p><p>CRITICIZED THE ARAB LEADERS FOR NOT CONSIDERING OR DEBATING </p><p>SHEIKH ZAYID\'S PLAN FOR IRAQ AS A POSSIBLE WAY OUT OF THE CURRENT </p><p>IMPASSE.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL STRONGLY CRITICIZED SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S REQUEST OF THE ARAB SUMMIT TO ADVISE SADDAM TO SEEK </p><p>EXILE AS A SHAMELESS DIPLOMATIC PLOY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CRITICIZING ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE UAE\'S INITIATIVE FOR </p><p>IRAQ PRESENTED TO THE ARAB SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... ZAYED ADVISED THE ARAB LEADERS OF THE EXPECTED EARTHQUAKE, </p><p>AND, WHILE IN DIRE NEED OF COUNSEL, THEY HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING ALL </p><p>ADVICE DURING THE PREVIOUS DECADES, NOT REALIZING THE GRAVE </p><p>CONCEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS, WHICH CAUSED ALL (PREVIOUS) CRISES </p><p>IN THE FIRST PLACE ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  REMARKING ON THE DECISIONS MADE AT AND THE U.S. ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARDS THE ARAB SUMMIT, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... GIVEN THE U.S. ATTITUDE OVERLOOKING THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI- </p><p>WAR MOOD, AND ITS INSISTANCE ON CHANGING THE FACTS AS A </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS ATTACKS, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL TAKE </p><p>INTO CONSIDERATION THE DECISIONS MADE BY AN ARAB SUMMIT IN SHARM </p><p>AL SHEIKH, WHILE REALIZING THAT THE ARABS WERE NEVER SERIOUS </p><p>ABOUT ANY OF THEIR DECISIONS?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE UAE\'S INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED TO THE ARAB </p><p>SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/02: </p><p> </p><p>"...  THE UAE\'S INITIATIVE CALLING ON SADDAM TO STEP DOWN AND </p><p>LEAVE IRAQ WITH INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES TO PROTECT HIS DIGNITY </p><p>IS A PRICE THAT SHOULD BE PAID TO AVERT WAR AND IS THE CHEAPEST </p><p>PRICE TO SAVE THE PEOPLE, THE COUNTRY, AND THE WHOLE REGION.  THE </p><p>CONCEQUENCES OF ANY OTHER CHOICE ARE WELL-KNOWN BECAUSE THE U.S. </p><p>IS DETERMINED ON PLAYING TO THE VERY END TO TOPPLE THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE ARAB SUMMIT AND THE AMERICAN DISDAIN FOR </p><p>IT, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE IRAQIS ARE THREATENED BY ANOTHER \'TRANSFER\' WHEN </p><p>DISCUSSING THE EFFECTS OF THE ANTICIPATED BUSH-BLAIR WAR THAT </p><p>COULD LEAD TO THE EMIGRATION OF TWO MILLION IRAQIS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>STATISTICS, IT MIGHT ALSO CAUSE THE DEATHS AND INJURIES OF </p><p>ANOTHER MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE AMERICAN PLANS TO BOMB IRAQ </p><p>WITH THOUSANDS OF MISSILES.  THE WHITE HOUSE IS PLANNING ON </p><p>TRANSFORMING IRAQ FROM AN ARAB COUNTRY INTO AN AMERICAN TERRITORY </p><p>IN THE HEART OF THE ARAB WORLD AND THEN APPLYING THIS "MODEL" IN </p><p>THE REGION ... THE LEAST THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT THE </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS SUBMITTED TO THE ARAB SUMMIT BY COLIN POWELL, U.S. </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE, IS THAT IT REPRESENTS A SHAMELESS DIPLOMATIC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PLOY TO IMPOSE CERTAIN OPINIONS ON THE SUMMIT.  THIS MUST URGE </p><p>THE ARABS TO TAKE A STRONG STAND IN THE SUMMIT FOLLOWING U.S. </p><p>DISDAIN OF ARABS AND ANYTHING THEY REPRESENT ... THE SUMMIT IS </p><p>REQUESTED TO ASSERT TO THE U.S THAT THE ARABS HAVE REACHED A </p><p>POINT WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM.  WHAT IS REQUIRED </p><p>IS A UNIFIED ARAB ATTITUDE AND NOT A RAMBLING STAND FED BY THE </p><p>U.S TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND THOSE OF ISRAEL.  WITHOUT THIS, THE </p><p>CHANCE WILL BE LOST, JUST AS OTHERS BEFORE IT, AND THERE WILL BE </p><p>NO NEED FOR ANY SUMMITS SINCE THE U.S. WILL BE POSITIONED IN THE </p><p>ARAB REGION CONTROLLING EVERYTHING.  THE CURRENT IRAQI CRISIS, </p><p>AFTER THE PALESTINIAN CRISIS, WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR FURTHER </p><p>CRISES IN THE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTING SADDAM\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ANTICIPATED WAR, EDITOR- </p><p>IN-CHIEF OF "AL-BAYAN" KHALED MUHAMMAD AHMAD WROTE ON 3/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... AT A TIME WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD, AND THE ARAB WORLD IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, IS BUSY WITH THE ANTICIPATED U.S. WAR AGAINST IRAQ, </p><p>IRAQI NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED \'SADDAM\'S ORDERS\' TO HIGHLY RANKED </p><p>OFFICIALS AND SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS TO LOSE WEIGHT OR ELSE </p><p>LOSE PART OF THEIR WAGES AND OTHER PRIVALAGES ... SADDAM HAS </p><p>PUSHED THE ARABS INTO MANY WARS; THE WAR WITH IRAN WHICH ENDED </p><p>WITH IRAQ\'S DEFEAT, AND \'THE MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES\' WHICH ENDED </p><p>WITH THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF IRAQ.  HOW DOES SADDAM WANT TO END </p><p>THIS THIRD WAR, WHICH SEEMS VERY IMMINENT?  ARABS ARE HELPLESS </p><p>AND ARE EVEN UNABLE TO STOP IT!!" </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
