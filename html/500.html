<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 02013 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (DELETING SECTION INFORMATION) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  EMERGENCE OF BASHIR? - ROLE DEFINING IN THE </p><p>          NIF DOMINATED GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ADDIS ABABA 01259 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  FROM A NUMBER OF CONTACTS </p><p>WE HAVE HAD LATELY IN KHARTOUM\'S EVER ACTIVE </p><p>POLITICAL CIRCLES, THERE IS PLAUSIBLE, BUT NOT YET </p><p>CONCLUSIVE, HOPE THAT SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT MAY BE </p><p>TRYING TO WIGGLE OUT SOMEWHAT FROM UNDER THE NIF </p><p>SHADOW.  BASHIR\'S CONTINUING WEAKNESS, HOWEVER, IS </p><p>THAT HIS CORE SUPPORT GROUP, THE ARMY, IS BEING </p><p>REMOLDED DAY BY DAY BY THE NIF.  WHEN IT COMES TO </p><p>POLITICAL ASSETS, BASHIR HAS HAD LITTLE TO RECOMMEND </p><p>HIM BUT HIS UNIFORM.  THAT NOW MAY BE DEVALUED.  ANY </p><p>INDEPENDENCE HE NOW MAY SHOW, PERHAPS USING THE NEW </p><p>TNC, MAY WELL BE TOO LATE TO MATTER MUCH.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A RECENT CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCM, POL&ECON </p><p>COUNSELOR AND PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR CIVILIAN </p><p>AFFAIRS AHMED ZEIN AL ABDIEN, NEWLY NAMED TO THE </p><p>TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL AND LONG A DUP PARTY </p><p>STALWART, PARALLELED GENERALLY THE LINE WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>HEARING FROM OTHERS LATELY THAT BASHIR HAS SOME </p><p>IDEAS OF HIS OWN AND IS NOT A TOTALLY KEPT MAN. </p><p>THIS ARGUMENT ALSO SQUARES WITH THE COMMENTS BASHIR </p><p>IS REPORTED TO HAVE MADE TO TGE PRESIDENT MELES AND </p><p>PGE CHIEF ISAIAS DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO ASMARA. </p><p>(REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>4.  AL ABDEIN HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR FEW BRIDGES TO </p><p>BASHIR AS US/SUDAN RELATIONS SOURED AND SANK.  HE IS </p><p>A WESTERN ORIENTED LAWYER, AN OLD TIME POLITICIAN </p><p>AND WHEELER-DEALER, AND AN ODD MAN IN BASHIR\'S </p><p>ENTOURAGE.  WE TAKE HIM FOR A MESSAGE BEARER, AND A </p><p>MAN TO REPORT HIS SOUNDINGS TO BASHIR.  AS FAR AS WE </p><p>CAN TELL, HE IS NOT SOME NIF PLANT DOUBLING ON </p><p>BASHIR BUT HAS HIS OWN AXES TO GRIND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN THE COURSE OF A LENGTHY CONVERSATION ON THE </p><p>NEW PSEUDO-PARLIAMENT, THE TNC, AL ABDEIN SAID HE </p><p>HAD RECEIVED BY DIRECT INTERVENTION WITH BASHIR, A </p><p>FAIR SLICE OF THE SEATS FOR HIS OWN DUP PARTY </p><p>CRONIES.  HE DESCRIBED THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF </p><p>POLITICAL WHEELING AND DEALING, ASSURING US THAT, </p><p>NIF OR NOT, SUDAN STILL HAD PLENTY OF ACTIVE </p><p>POLITICKING GOING ON. </p><p> </p><p>6.  HE ALSO MADE THE POINT THAT THE TNC COULD, NOT </p><p>WOULD, DEVELOP INTO A POLITICAL MECHANISM OF USE TO </p><p>BASHIR DESPITE ITS RIGGED NIF MAJORITY OF </p><p>APPOINTEES.  AL ABDEIN WENT TO SOME LENGTH TO PAINT </p><p>BASHIR AS A MAN BURDENED WITH OFFICE, AN </p><p>UNSOPHISTICATED BUT GENERALLY HONEST SOLDIER WHO WAS </p><p>IN OVER HIS HEAD.  AL ABDEIN VERY STRONGLY </p><p>SUGGESTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE TNC COULD TURN OUT TO </p><p>BE A BASHIR HORSE TO THE NIF\'S TROY.  IF PROPERLY </p><p>USED, THE TNC COULD SERVE TO BUILD POLITICAL POWER </p><p>BACKING THE PRESIDENT.  HE WOULD NOT BE DRAWN OUT ON </p><p>THE CHANCES FOR THIS COMING ABOUT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MORE COMMENT: WE DOUBT THAT AN EMERGENCE OF </p><p>BASHIR VIA THE TNC IS IN THE CARDS.  FROM ALL THAT </p><p>WE HAVE SEEN OF IT AND ITS ORGANISATION, THE TNC </p><p>MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES AN OLD SOVIET STYLE PEOPLES </p><p>CONGRESS, A PULPIT FOR THE OLIGARCHS TO USE TO </p><p>RECEIVE PREPARED OVATIONS.  BUT AL ABDEIN\'S </p><p>SUGGESTION THAT BASHIR MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS BODY </p><p>AND HIS REPEATED ASSERTION THAT BASHIR IS NOT JUST A </p><p>CIPHER, LEAD US TO THINK BASHIR MAY IN FACT HAVE </p><p>SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE HIS NIF MENTORS HAVE LED </p><p>HIM AND HIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  EVEN IF TRUE, IT MAY WELL BE TOO LATE.  IN ANY </p><p>EVENT, THE NIF ARE MAKING IT MORE AND MORE CLEAR </p><p>THAT THEY PLAY ROUGH; ANY ERRANT SHOW OF INDEPENDENCE </p><p>IN THE TNC IS LIKELY TO GET ITS AUTHOR SMACKED DOWN </p><p>PROMPTLY.  IF BASHIR HOPES TO USE THE TNC TO BUILD </p><p>HIMSELF A POLITICAL BASE, HE WILL HAVE TO MOVE WITH </p><p>MORE POLITICAL SAVVY AND ENERGY THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN </p><p>HIM SO FAR. </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
