(U) On June 3, the Bank of Canada downgraded its </p><p>2003 growth outlook for Canada from nearly 4%, in May, </p><p>to 2.5- 3%.  BOC Governor Dodge confirmed the less </p><p>optimistic view in a June 18 speech, saying that the </p><p>BOC now expects continued softness in the Canadian </p><p>economy over the short term.  A number of private </p><p>sector economists have recently announced downward </p><p>revisions to their short-term forecasts as well. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On June 17, Federal Finance Minister John Manley </p><p>announced that the GOC is slashing its 2003 economic </p><p>growth forecast by up to a full percentage point, </p><p>possibly to 2.2%.  Manley stressed that federal </p><p>finances will remain in the black, but cited increased </p><p>federal spending to cope with the fallout from SARS and </p><p>mad cow disease, the weak U.S. economy and the sharply </p><p>rising C$ as factors contributing to the GOC\'s more </p><p>pessimistic view. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. SBU) First Quarter GDP data released by Statistics </p><p>Canada on May 30 shows that the Canadian economy grew </p><p>at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter </p><p>of 2003 - up from a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the </p><p>preceding three months. However, the brisk activity in </p><p>consumer spending, residential construction, and </p><p>government expenditures was overshadowed by a massive </p><p>involuntary build-up in inventories, in particular in </p><p>the auto sector.  In addition, exports of goods and </p><p>services declined for the second consecutive quarter </p><p>and the recent appreciation of the C$ (up 18% against </p><p>the US$ since the beginning of the year) point to </p><p>further weakness.  This will further exacerbate </p><p>conditions in the manufacturing sector which has lost </p><p>66,000 factory jobs over the past six months, nearly </p><p>half of the 141,000 jobs created in that sector in the </p><p>past two years.  These job losses point to short-term </p><p>weakness in consumer spending and government revenues. </p><p>Over the longer term, the cuts in employment plus the </p><p>increase in investment in imported capital goods </p><p>supported by the stronger C$ should boost productivity. </p><p> </p><p>WE LOWER OUR FORECAST </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Revised data and the change in economic </p><p>conditions lead us to expect economic growth of 2.1% in </p><p>2003, rising to 3.2% in 2004.  On May 30, Statistics </p><p>Canada released actual GDP data for QI 2003, along with </p><p>quarterly revisions for previous years.  Incorporating </p><p>the revisions (which resulted in a higher base for </p><p>previous years) lowered our forecast projection (ref B) </p><p>to 2.4% for 2003 (from 3.5% in January), and 3.9% for </p><p>2004 (from January\'s 4.3% estimate).  Our April </p><p>economic and fiscal update (ref A) for 2003 revised the </p><p>January forecast numbers to around 3%, and to just </p><p>under 4% in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The BOC signaled a shift in monetary policy </p><p>on June 3, by leaving interest rates unchanged, </p><p>following two consecutive increases.  Given BOC </p><p>concerns about continued weakness over the next two </p><p>quarters, we assume a degree of monetary stimulus in </p><p>the short term that keeps our growth forecast for 2003 </p><p>just above 2%. </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
