Summary:  The 124th Session of the UN Food and </p><p>Agriculture Organization (FAO) Council will meet June 23- </p><p>28, 2003 in Rome.  Items of particular importance to the </p><p>U.S. during this Council session will be:  an agenda item </p><p>on Director General term limits; a U.S.-requested agenda </p><p>item on reporting on World Food Summit follow-up; the </p><p>Program of Work and Budget 2004-2005 (including the </p><p>proposal for a split currency assessment) and a proposal </p><p>for a second Global Forum of Food Safety Regulators.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The 124th session of the FAO Council will meet June </p><p>23-28, 2003 in Rome.  The 49-member Council is charged </p><p>with, inter alia, reviewing the world food and </p><p>agricultural situation and related matters; making </p><p>recommendations on the current and future activities of </p><p>the organization, including its program of work and </p><p>budget; exercising control over the financial management </p><p>of the organization and making recommendations to the </p><p>conference on amendments to the basic texts.  Independent </p><p>Chair of Council, Ambassador Aziz Mekouar (Morocco) is </p><p>expected to return to Rome to chair the Session, </p><p>Important issues for the upcoming session are highlighted </p><p>below: </p><p> </p><p>3.  Agenda item 1, Adoption of the Agenda. </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>The Council will have before it the U.S. request to add </p><p>an agenda item on reporting on World Food Summit follow- </p><p>up.  The EU supported the request by separate </p><p>communication to the FAO Director General. We understand </p><p>from the Secretariat that a short background paper will </p><p>be prepared.  If the Council agrees to add the item to </p><p>the agenda, U.S. delegation will need to be prepared to </p><p>take the lead on discussion and next steps. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Agenda Item 3, Summary Program of Work and Budget </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>The Council will have before it the Summary Program of </p><p>Work and Budget (SPWB), recently reviewed in the Finance </p><p>and Program Committees.  No decision on the final budget </p><p>level will be taken at the Council; U.S. delegation </p><p>should reiterate points made on the budget during the </p><p>Finance Committee (support for Zero Nominal Growth) and </p><p>in the technical committees (support for standard </p><p>setting, in particular, the Interim Commission on </p><p>Phytosanitary Measures). </p><p> </p><p>5.  Agenda Item 9, Report of the Committee on Agriculture </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>The Council will have before it the reports of all of the </p><p>technical committees.  U.S. intervention should </p><p>reiterate, in particular, points on the Food Chain </p><p>Approach to Food Safety, on Biosafety and on </p><p>Biotechnology made during COAG (reftel a). </p><p> </p><p>6.  Agenda Item 13, the Number and Length of Term of the </p><p>Office of the Director General </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Misoff queried the Secretariat concerning documentation </p><p>for this agenda item, which is still not available. </p><p>According to the FAO Legal Counsel, FAO is waiting for a </p><p>Report from the Independent Chair of Council on the </p><p>conclusion of the Friends of the Chair meetings on this </p><p>subject.  The first Chair\'s report contained explicit </p><p>language on the incumbent\'s rights to run again.  The </p><p>U.S., EU and Canada informed the Chair by writing that </p><p>this was not consistent with the agreement reached at the </p><p>Friends of the Chair (reftel b).  In the absence of a </p><p>Report from the Chair, the FAO Legal Office does not feel </p><p>that it can proceed to draft proposed changes to the FAO </p><p>Basic Texts. Comment: This item is particularly important </p><p>as any change to the Basic Texts must be approved by </p><p>Council and be notified to members 120 days before the </p><p>Conference.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Agenda Item 13, Report of the Finance Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>The Council must approve the proposed scale of </p><p>assessments and the proposed change to the Finance </p><p>Regulations allowing for national project execution. </p><p> </p><p>Other items from the Finance Committee will be for </p><p>Council comment and information.  USDel should speak on </p><p>the question of a split currency assessment, which will </p><p>be taken up again at the September Finance Committee </p><p>session. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Agenda Item 17, Convening of the Second Global Forum </p><p>of Food Safety Regulators </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>In addition to Council consideration, FAO and WHO will </p><p>hold a Preparatory Meeting at FAO Headquarters on July 8, </p><p>2003 of representatives of the G-8, the EC and other </p><p>donor countries as well as selected countries from each </p><p>FAO and WHO region to discuss the proposed second Global </p><p>Forum for Food Safety Regulators. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Agenda Item 18, Application for New Membership </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>Tuvalu has applied for membership with FAO. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Japanese request on composition of Finance and </p><p>Program Committees </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Japan has circulated two proposals to amend FAO\'s Basic </p><p>Texts concerning membership of the Program and Finance </p><p>Committees.  (Proposals faxed to IO/EDA Sharon Kotok </p><p>6/9/03).  Both of the proposals are designed to increase </p><p>Asian representation on the Committees. Neither proposal, </p><p>as drafted, would affect North American membership on the </p><p>Finance and Program Committees, but would affect other </p><p>regions.  Japan\'s intention is to improve their chances </p><p>(and that of the other Asian OECD member, Republic of </p><p>Korea) of a seat on the two Committees. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p>11. We expect that other regions will object to the </p><p>Japanese proposals as they reduces their presence on the </p><p>Committees. Any debate on the question is sure to arrive </p><p>at the question of why the North American region (with </p><p>only two countries and guaranteed seats on FAO\'s policy </p><p>making bodies) is so favored.  Clearly, this debate is </p><p>not in the U.S. (or Canada\'s interest).  End Comment. </p><p>Hall </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02546 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
