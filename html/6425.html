<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001285 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, KPAL, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACEFUL MARCHES IN PROTEST OF THE IMPENDING </p><p>U.S. MILITARY ATTACK ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The local press reported that students at the </p><p>UAE University in Al-Ain participated in a peaceful </p><p>anti-war demonstration on March 15. (Note: The UAE </p><p>University, with some 14,000 students, is the largest </p><p>in the UAE.  End note.) The march was organized by the </p><p>Emirates National Students\' Union (ENSU) and was the </p><p>first public protest by students against the war. </p><p>Marchers carried UAE flags and placards criticizing </p><p>the U.K. and the U.S. Speaking for the demonstrators, </p><p>Wahid Al Badi, president of ENSU, asserted there was </p><p>no justification for war. Badi was concerned that </p><p>innocent Iraqis would be killed and he called for </p><p>Muslim solidarity, especially with the Palestinian </p><p>people. (Note: The number of demonstrators was not </p><p>reported. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Another peaceful demonstration took place in </p><p>the Northern Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah on March 16. </p><p>Local press reported that hundreds of protesters of </p><p>various nationalities chanted slogans against the U.K. </p><p>and the U.S. They called for a peaceful resolution to </p><p>the Iraqi crisis and demanded that the inspectors be </p><p>allowed to do their job.  Protestors linked Iraq with </p><p>the Palestinian situation and accused the U.S. of </p><p>double standards, coveting Iraq\'s oil resources, and </p><p>humiliating Arabs. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: These rallies are not unexpected </p><p>considering the recent anti-war demonstrations that </p><p>have taken place throughout the world. The protests </p><p>here have been peaceful and well-organized and much </p><p>smaller than the demonstrations that took place </p><p>throughout the UAE at the beginning of the Intifadah </p><p>and the Israeli incursion into Jenin. More marches are </p><p>likely to occur in the near future, especially during </p><p>the first few days of a conflict with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
