Action Request; Para two </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The American Embassy in Nigeria requests </p><p>Washington reconsideration of our proposed government- </p><p>to-government "Food for Progress" activity.  This </p><p>proposal, presented by President Olusegun Obasanjo, </p><p>requests an allocation of 12,500 MT of rice to </p><p>implement the Women\'s Initiative for Sex Education and </p><p>Empowerment (WISE) in Nigeria.  We believe the sale of </p><p>this donated rice will be not only beneficial in terms </p><p>of the targeted audience of the WISE project but also </p><p>will complement other objectives of our Mission </p><p>Program Plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Mission has several programs in place that </p><p>focus on health.  However, due to the very high </p><p>incidence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, as well as the lack </p><p>of direct support to vulnerable young women, we </p><p>believe this program will be especially beneficial in </p><p>central Nigeria.  Abuja, Nigeria\'s new capital city, </p><p>for example, has one of the highest incidences of </p><p>HIV/AIDS in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  President Obasanjo has a very keen interest in </p><p>this program.  On numerous occasions, he has asked me </p><p>as well as the AfriCare representative for information </p><p>about the status of the proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Approval of this program may help provide </p><p>Nigeria\'s private sector as well as the Mission with </p><p>leverage in other areas.  For example, several rice </p><p>processors/importers are currently seeking a five </p><p>percent duty on imported paddy rice.  However, most of </p><p>the rice imported is parboiled rice from India and </p><p>Thailand which is subject to a duty of 100 percent. </p><p>The U.S. would be able to supply a greater share of </p><p>the market if the GON were to agree to support this </p><p>private sector proposal for a two-tiered duty for </p><p>rice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The GON is increasingly using protectionist </p><p>measures such as import bans to support local </p><p>agriculture/agro-processing. Realistically, Nigeria </p><p>cannot become self-sufficient in most product areas </p><p>due to insufficient infrastructure and credit, high </p><p>cost of inputs, etc.  USG support in the form of </p><p>government-to-government food aid, may encourage the </p><p>GON to rely on methods to support the agriculture </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  We understand this proposal was considered under a </p><p>competitive process.  However, given the Mission\'s </p><p>strong support for this initiative, we hope funding </p><p>can be found to move the project forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
