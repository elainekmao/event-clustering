<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001182 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION G8 SUMMIT AND NEPAD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "NEPAD\'s Zim quarantine a false </p><p>   start" the independent weekly "Zimbabwe Independent" </p><p>   warns the G8 countries meeting in Canada next month not </p><p>   to ignore the crisis in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Remarks by the Canadian High Commissioner to </p><p>   South Africa\'s Thabo Mbeki reveal a worrying trend: </p><p>   The G8 countries are preparing to swallow the </p><p>   deception that African leaders have the Zimbabwe </p><p>   crisis \'in hand\' and thereby qualify for the US$64 </p><p>   billion on offer for trade and investment under the </p><p>   NEPAD plan. . .  The Canadian statement this week </p><p>   signaled that collective self-deception about peer </p><p>   review has become the official line.  Zimbabwe as a </p><p>   topic will be quarantined so its contagion does not </p><p>   infect the NEPAD process even though the Zimbabwe </p><p>   crisis itself is demonstrably infecting the region. </p><p>   Statements following Mbeki\'s visits to Oslo and </p><p>   London this week confirm that nothing will be </p><p>   allowed to get in the way of the NEPAD juggernaut. </p><p>   The West wants an African success story and NEPAD, </p><p>   they hope, is it. </p><p> </p><p>   "Zimbabwe\'s crisis meanwhile cannot be so easily </p><p>   swept under the G8 carpet.  It is the elephant in </p><p>   the living room.  It cannot be ignored.  The </p><p>   humanitarian disaster that is already unfolding </p><p>   across the land is the direct product of bad </p><p>   governance, not drought.  And this tragedy has been </p><p>   allowed to develop precisely because African </p><p>   leaders indulged President Mugabe by recognizing </p><p>   his flawed victory in the presidential poll.  If G8 </p><p>   leaders cannot see the contradiction between that </p><p>   act of political dishonesty and NEPAD\'s proclaimed </p><p>   commitment to good governance, the project is </p><p>   doomed from the outset.  There will be no African </p><p>   recovery, no renaissance until leaders like Mbeki </p><p>   and Obasanjo get to grips with rogue rulers in the </p><p>   midst.  That means speaking out on human rights </p><p>   abuses, lawlessness and economic sabotage.  The G8 </p><p>   should make this clear.  Looking the other way in </p><p>   Canada is no basis for future relations between the </p><p>   developed world and Africa." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
