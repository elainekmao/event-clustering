<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: A SNAPSHOT OF THE IRAQI COMMUNITY IN JORDAN - SOME </p><p>OF THE POOREST OF THE POOR </p><p> </p><p>REF:  AMMAN 1587 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) AS PART OF ROUTINE REFCOORD MONITORING OF PRM-FUNDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN </p><p>(MONITORING REPORT SUBMITTED REFTEL), FSN REFUGEE ASSISTANT </p><p>VISITED THE HOMES OF THREE VULNERABLE IRAQI FAMILIES LIVING </p><p>IN JORDAN, ALL OF WHOM HAD OBTAINED OR WERE SEEKING </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC MIGRATION </p><p>COMMISSION (ICMC)\'S USG-FUNDED PROJECT.  THE FAMILIES LIVE </p><p>IN HASHMI SHAMALI AND JABAL AL-NASR, POOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN </p><p>AMMAN THAT ARE HOME TO LARGE NUMBERS OF IRAQIS.  BASED ON </p><p>THESE HOME VISITS, IT APPEARS THAT THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF </p><p>VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN DO NOT DIFFER WIDELY FROM OTHER </p><p>ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS, SUCH AS PALESTINIAN </p><p>REFUGEES WHO QUALIFY FOR UNRWA SPECIAL HARDSHIP STATUS OR </p><p>IMPOVERISHED JORDANIANS IN SOUTHERN JORDAN.  THE IRAQIS\' </p><p>GREATEST HARDSHIP SEEMS TO COME FROM THEIR ILLEGAL STATUS IN </p><p>JORDAN, WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM ACCESSING GOJ PUBLIC </p><p>SERVICES, PARTICULARLY IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) WHILE THE REASONS FOR THEIR PRESENCE IN JORDAN </p><p>VARY, THESE IRAQIS SHARE THE SAME DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES: </p><p>LARGELY ILLEGAL STATUS, LIMITED ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND </p><p>HEALTH CARE, LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SUBSTANDARD </p><p>HOUSING AND CONSTANT FEAR OF REPRISAL FROM THE IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND/OR DEPORTATION BY THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE UNHCR-RECOGNIZED REFUGEES HOPE TO LEAVE JORDAN QUICKLY, </p><p>TO BEGIN LIFE IN A THIRD COUNTRY.  THOSE IRAQIS RESIDENT IN </p><p>JORDAN WITHOUT UNHCR STATUS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AND </p><p>MANY REPORT THAT THEY MAY RESORT TO ILLEGAL SMUGGLING TO </p><p>FIND JOBS IN EUROPE.  ALL THE IRAQIS INTERVIEWED EXPRESSED A </p><p>GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY CONCERNING POSSIBLE HOSTILITIES IN </p><p>IRAQ - PARTICULARLY FOR THE SAFETY OF FAMILY MEMBERS </p><p>REMAINING INSIDE IRAQ.  THEY ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR FEAR AND </p><p>DISLIKE OF THE CURRENT IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  SKETCHES OF THEIR </p><p>INDIVIDUAL STORIES FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE RECENT ARRIVALS:  A LOOSE FAMILY GROUPING - </p><p>FATALLY ILL DAUGHTER, TWO GRANDPARENTS AND AN UNCLE - CAME </p><p>TO JORDAN ONE MONTH AGO IN SEARCH OF MEDICAL TREATMENT.  THE </p><p>GIRL\'S FATHER WAS GIVEN PERMISSION BY THE IRAQI AND </p><p>JORDANIAN GOVERNMENTS TO REMAIN IN JORDAN FOR FOUR DAYS </p><p>ONLY, AND LEFT HIS DAUGHTER IN THE CARE OF THE OTHER ADULT </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS.  THE GIRL\'S UNCLE REPORTEDLY QUIT THE IRAQI </p><p>ARMY WITHOUT PERMISSION; HE AND HIS PARENTS FEAR PUNISHMENT </p><p>IF THEY RETURN TO IRAQ.  THIS FAMILY, LIKE MANY OTHER </p><p>DIVIDED FAMILIES, DID NOT SEEK UNHCR ASSISTANCE AS ASYLUM- </p><p>SEEKERS BECAUSE THEY FEAR RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS STILL LIVING IN IRAQ. THE IRAQI COMMUNITY IN JORDAN </p><p>WIDELY BELIEVES THAT UNHCR OFFICES ARE WATCHED CLOSELY BY </p><p>IRAQI INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS, WHO ALLEGEDLY REPORT ALL ASYLUM </p><p>SEEKERS TO BAGHDAD, WITH REPERCUSSIONS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS </p><p>REMAINING INSIDE IRAQ.  THE FAMILY SOUGHT ICMC\'S HELP IN </p><p>OBTAINING MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THE GIRL, WHO WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS.  WHILE ICMC HAS </p><p>PROVIDED MEDICAL TREATMENT UNDER THE USG GRANT, IT IS ABLE </p><p>TO PROVIDE LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.  THE FAMILY WILL RUN OUT </p><p>OF SAVINGS IN TWO MONTHS AND HAS NO OTHER MEANS OF SUPPORT. </p><p>AS ILLEGAL RESIDENTS, THEIR WORK OPPORTUNITIES ARE EXTREMELY </p><p>LIMITED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE UNHCR CASE:  A SHI\'A FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLD </p><p>WITH FIVE CHILDREN, THIS FAMILY ARRIVED IN JORDAN IN JANUARY </p><p>2000 AND RECEIVED UNHCR REFUGEE STATUS IN 2002.  THE FEMALE </p><p>HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD REPORTS THAT HER HUSBAND WAS FORCED TO </p><p>REJOIN THE IRAQI ARMY AFTER HE HAD ALREADY FINISHED HIS </p><p>COMPULSORY SERVICE.  THE WOMAN KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HER </p><p>HUSBAND\'S WHEREABOUTS AND BELIEVES HER BROTHER-IN-LAW MIGHT </p><p>HAVE BEEN EXECUTED AS PUNISHMENT AFTER HER HUSBAND FLED THE </p><p>ARMY. THE FAMILY IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON UNHCR ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO COVER THEIR HOUSING COSTS AND ON OCCASIONAL CHARITY AND </p><p>SUPPORT TO PURCHASE FOOD.  THE FAMILY REPORTS THAT THEY WERE </p><p>HARASSED BY THE JORDANIAN COMMUNITY IN THE THEIR PREVIOUS </p><p>RESIDENCE IN JABAL AL-NASR, WHEN THEIR DISABLED 17-YEAR OLD </p><p>CHILD WAS BEATEN BY NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN, THE MOTHER WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY THREATENED BY THE PERPETRATORS\' FAMILIES AND </p><p>THE JORDANIAN POLICE FINALLY ADVISED THE FAMILY TO MOVE. </p><p>WITH HOPES OF ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM UNHCR, </p><p>THE FAMILY MOVED TO A NEW APARTMENT IN JEBEL EL WEBDEH, A </p><p>SAFER AND MORE EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD.  THIS FAMILY RECENTLY </p><p>TOOK IN ANOTHER IRAQI FAMILY - A SINGLE MOTHER AND FOUR </p><p>CHILDREN - LEAVING A TOTAL OF ELEVEN PEOPLE LIVING IN A 75- </p><p>SQUARE METER (ROUGHLY 675 SQUARE FEET) APARTMENT.  THE </p><p>FEMALE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD HAS STARTED CLEANING HOUSES IN THE </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT HER EARNINGS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT HER </p><p>FAMILY.  THE FAMILY SEEKS ICMC ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING </p><p>MEDICAL CARE FOR THE 17 YEAR-OLD DISABLED CHILD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS:  A FIVE-PERSON MUSLIM </p><p>FAMILY HAS BEEN LIVING IN JORDAN ILLEGALLY FOR FIVE YEARS, </p><p>HAVING LEFT IRAQ FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.  THE MALE HEAD OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLD WORKS AS AN ILLEGAL DAY LABORER, TRAVELING </p><p>CONSTANTLY AROUND JORDAN LOOKING FOR WORK AND LIVING ON </p><p>BELOW-STANDARD WAGES.  THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT ALLOWED THE </p><p>CHILDREN TO BE REGISTERED AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>REASONS BUT DOES NOT PERMIT THE FAMILY TO USE GOJ HEALTH </p><p>FACILITIES.  ONE OF THE CHILDREN IS SUFFERING FROM A SERIOUS </p><p>BLOOD DISEASE AND MOST OF THE TIME IS UNABLE TO ATTEND </p><p>SCHOOL.  THE FAMILY DOES NOT KNOW HOW LONG THEY WILL BE ABLE </p><p>TO STAY IN JORDAN AND APPARENTLY HAS NO MEANS TO GO BACK TO </p><p>IRAQ.  THE FAMILY SEEKS ICMC ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING MEDICAL </p><p>TREATMENT FOR THE ILL CHILD. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
