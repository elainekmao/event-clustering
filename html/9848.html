<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001981 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICAL TENSIONS RELATED TO RIOS MONTT\'S </p><p>CANDIDACY SUBSIDE </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1952 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affairs David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and ( </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Following the Constitutional Court\'s controversial </p><p>July 30 decision to order the Supreme Electoral Tribunal </p><p>(TSE) and Registry of Persons to register FRG leader Efrain </p><p>Rios Montt as a presidential candidate in the November </p><p>elections (reftel), the political opposition and civil </p><p>society groups have changed their strategy from opposing Rios </p><p>Montt\'s candidacy in the courts to a strategy of getting out </p><p>the anti-Rios Montt vote on election day.  Two political </p><p>parties (the UNE and Partido Patriota) filed motions with the </p><p>TSE calling on it to disqualify Rios Montt\'s candidacy, but </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the action was largely symbolic as the TSE has already made </p><p>it clear it will not go against the instructions of the </p><p>Constitutional Court.  Editorials in all the leading </p><p>newspapers focused on the importance of educating voters </p><p>about the ills of keeping the FRG in power, and tacitly </p><p>accepted that Rios Montt is now a candidate and the decision </p><p>will be made at the ballot box. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In statements to the press, OAS Election Monitoring </p><p>Mission Chief, Former President of Peru Valentin Paniagua </p><p>called on all sides to refrain from electoral violence, </p><p>saying that the events of July 24-25 only cloud the process </p><p>of free and fair elections.  When questioned about the </p><p>Constitutional Court\'s decision to allow Rios Montt to be a </p><p>candidate, Paniagua responded that the Mission would not </p><p>comment on the legal qualifications of any candidate as that </p><p>was up to Guatemalan courts to decide. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Paniagua\'s deputy, Moises Benamor, told us that the </p><p>Mission was in contact with numerous political sectors on </p><p>July 31, and all had come around to accepting, however </p><p>reluctantly, the Constitutional Court\'s decision.  He said </p><p>that at the July 31 meeting of the OAS-sponsored Forum of </p><p>Political Parties, the opposition parties did not discuss </p><p>challenging the finding of the Constitutional Court, and </p><p>spent most of the session discussing ways to bring the FRG </p><p>back into the forum (Note: opposition party reps expelled the </p><p>FRG from the forum after the FRG-led violent protests of July </p><p>24-25. End note).  Benamor told us that there were reports </p><p>that some in the Supreme Court were upset about the </p><p>Constitutional Court\'s decision, but had not been able to </p><p>come up with a legal strategy to challenge it.  Benamor\'s </p><p>assessment was that the phase for challenging Rios Montt\'s </p><p>candidacy in the courts was now effectively over, and that </p><p>all sides would focus on winning votes. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Avenues for prolonging the constitutional </p><p>challenge to Rios Montt\'s presidential candidacy were </p><p>effectively closed by the Constitutional Court\'s July 30 </p><p>decision, and the registration of his candidacy by the </p><p>Supreme Electoral Tribunal on July 31.  While procedural </p><p>challenges, like the ones filed by UNE and the Partido </p><p>Patriota, may continue to crop up, all sides now recognize </p><p>that Rios Montt will be a candidate and the battle will take </p><p>place on election day. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
