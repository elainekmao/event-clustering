<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS AMBUSH VIP SECURITY DETAIL ON MAJOR </p><p>HIGHWAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 509 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Maoists ambushed a police security team in </p><p>Sindupalchowk district March 13, killing six officers and </p><p>seriously injuring six others, police sources confirmed. </p><p>Press reports state that the insurgents electronically </p><p>detonated explosives laid in the road.  The attack </p><p>occurred on the Arniko Highway - the main route to the </p><p>Tibet border - about 55 kilometers east of Kathmandu.  The </p><p>22-member police team was on its way to meet and escort </p><p>Parliament Speaker Taranath Ranabhat and State Minister </p><p>for Health Mohan Basnet, who were to travel from the </p><p>capital to a program at a high school in Bahrabise.  The </p><p>two cancelled their trip on learning of the ambush. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) This is the second attack in four days on police </p><p>detailed to guard high-ranking Nepalese officials.  The </p><p>detail attacked March 9 (Reftel) had just completed a VIP </p><p>security assignment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment:  The insurgents\' recent guerrilla </p><p>actions are becoming both more frequent and more daring. </p><p>Both the March 9 and 13 ambushes took place in broad </p><p>daylight.  In each case, however, the police appear to </p><p>have been targets of opportunity; the VIPs were not in the </p><p>area at the time.  Maoists have attacked high-level </p><p>government figures in the past; a February 3, 2001 attack </p><p>on the Chief Justice\'s convoy killed six.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
