The U.S. side admitted that </p><p>the arrests were wrong, but declined to apologize. </p><p>`Both sides expressed regret over the incident, and for </p><p>the treatment of Turkish soldiers during the detention </p><p>period,\' the statement read.  Both sides have agreed to </p><p>take additional measures to improve cooperation and </p><p>coordination to prevent a recurrence of similar </p><p>incidents.  "Sabah" claims that at the commission </p><p>meetings on Monday, U.S. officials presented to the </p><p>Turks documents proving that Turkish troops in Northern </p><p>Iraq had given weapons to the Turkomen.  The Turks </p><p>responded by showing the Americans photos of U.S. </p><p>officials meeting with PKK/KADEK members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. wants Turkomans disarmed: "Milliyet" writes that </p><p>U.S. troops in Northern Iraq will launch an operation </p><p>against Turkomen offices in Irbil, Kirkuk, Mosul, and </p><p>Suleymaniye because the Turkomen have so far refused to </p><p>relinquish their weapons.  The Turkomen have told the </p><p>Americans that they wished to keep the weapons because </p><p>of safety concerns, and agreed to be disarmed only if </p><p>KDP and PUK also lay down their arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Talabani sends warm message to Ankara: PUK leader </p><p>Talabani has encouraged Ankara to open a consulate in </p><p>Suleymaniye, according to "Yeni Safak.".  Believing </p><p>Talabani to be the main figure responsible for the </p><p>Suleymaniye incident, Ankara has refused to renew the </p><p>PUK leader\'s Turkish passport.  The paper regards the </p><p>Talabani offer as a goodwill gesture to mend fences </p><p>with Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson expects no delay in aid for Turkey: </p><p>Speaking to the press after a farewell visit to </p><p>Turkey\'s Union of Chambers (TOBB) on Monday, U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson said that the U.S. would not delay </p><p>the $1 billion grant to Turkey for damages suffered </p><p>during the Iraq crisis.  Pearson said that the U.S. </p><p>side is expecting a Turkish delegation in Washington to </p><p>discuss final details of the assistance package. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey downsizes military: Turkey\'s military has </p><p>decided to reduce its troops by 17 percent, and began </p><p>dismissing 90,000 soldiers, dailies report.  The </p><p>duration of compulsory military service has been </p><p>reduced from 18 to 15 months, and from 16 to 12 months </p><p>for reserve officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Turkoman Shock for Ankara" </p><p>Sedat Ergin evaluates the Iraqi governing council in </p><p>mass appeal Hurriyet (7/15): "For the Turkoman </p><p>representative, Ambassador Paul Bremer\'s choice was a </p><p>lady from the Turkoman Women\'s Union as opposed to </p><p>Ahmed Aga, leader of Iraqi Turkoman Front.  This choice </p><p>is completely against what Ankara had been expecting to </p><p>see, and it has a special meaning.  The US took care to </p><p>include all political organizations in Iraq, with the </p><p>notable exception of the Turkoman.  The Turkoman </p><p>community has been given representation in the </p><p>governing council not through its main political </p><p>organization, but through a non-governmental </p><p>organization.  The US apparently does not want to </p><p>involve Turkey in the process of Iraq\'s political </p><p>future. . Bremer\'s final list clearly says to Ankara </p><p>that Turkey will not be a part of the political </p><p>dialogue with the US about Iraq. . After all, this is </p><p>the `political operation\' that comes after the recent </p><p>military operation against the Turks in Suleymaniye." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Global Gangster" </p><p>Ozgen Acar argued in the social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (7/15): "It seems the situation for </p><p>President Bush is getting messier every day.  He is now </p><p>labeled as a `liar,\' and things are not promising for </p><p>the future, since the Iraq occupation is becoming an </p><p>increasingly complex issue.  . Popular support for Bush </p><p>has dropped from 90 percent to 58.  The Defense </p><p>Secretary is after supplemental budget, which signals </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that in Iraq the US will have to spend more than it can </p><p>possibly earn from oil revenues. . The US failed to </p><p>capture Usama Bin Laden in Afghanistan or Saddam in </p><p>Iraq.  Yet US intelligence managed to capture 11 </p><p>Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq prior to their </p><p>assassination attempt against the governor of Kirkuk. </p><p>It looks like the day is approaching when nobody will </p><p>take the CIA seriously." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
