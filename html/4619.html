<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001553 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, INL AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA AND FINCEN </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>NSC FOR BEERS </p><p>MANILA ALSO FOR USED/ADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EFIN, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: INITIAL MONEY LAUNDERING INVESTIGATIONS IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 908 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Burma has begun at least two investigations </p><p>under its new money laundering law.  It has frozen assets </p><p>worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and applied to the </p><p>courts for forfeiture of a variety of property connected with </p><p>two high-profile narcotics cases.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Burma has moved with extraordinary speed to deal with </p><p>problems of money laundering identified by the Financial </p><p>Action Task Force.  On June 17, 2002, it enacted a powerful </p><p>new law which criminalized money laundering in connection </p><p>with virtually every kind of serious criminal activity.  A </p><p>Central Control Board chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs </p><p>was established in July and training for financial </p><p>investigators was conducted in Rangoon and Mandalay in July </p><p>and August.  Most importantly, the first investigations under </p><p>the new law were begun within weeks of its passage.  Two </p><p>cases, in particular, stand out.  The first involves the Gold </p><p>Uni Investment Company; the second is directed at Tuan Sin </p><p>Htan, one of the principals in the October 2000 Fiji drug </p><p>bust. </p><p> </p><p>Gold Uni Investment Company </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 12, police officials in Hong Kong discovered </p><p>12.5 kilograms of heroin concealed within a shipment of raw </p><p>jade stones from Burma.  They relayed information to Burma\'s </p><p>Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which </p><p>immediately opened up an investigation.  Numerous arrests </p><p>followed.  On July 19, Burma\'s new financial investigation </p><p>unit was also tasked with pursuing leads in regard to bank </p><p>accounts and currency transfers.  As a result of the work of </p><p>the financial investigation unit, CCDAC has now filed under </p><p>the new money laundering law for forfeiture of assets worth </p><p>approximately Burmese Kyat 166 million (i.e., USD 166,000). </p><p>The assets include four residential buildings, one poultry </p><p>feed factory, five automobiles and one motorcycle, and five </p><p>raw jade stones.  In addition, CCDAC has filed for a court </p><p>order freezing all savings and checking accounts of suspects </p><p>in the case, and is auditing eleven other accounts to </p><p>determine if there is any further cause for action against </p><p>other individuals. </p><p> </p><p>Tuan Sin Htan </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On October 28, a multinational investigation team </p><p>seized 357 kilograms of heroin in Suva, Fiji.  Shipping </p><p>documents pointed to a Burma-based trading company, KMT </p><p>Trading Enterprise.  CCDAC opened an investigation and, using </p><p>powers granted under both its 1993 Narcotics Law and the new </p><p>money laundering law, identified the following assets for </p><p>forfeiture: 12 buildings, one golf course, one recreation </p><p>center, two orange groves, two vehicles, three heavy </p><p>construction vehicles, and one plot of undeveloped land.  It </p><p>also froze all of the checking and savings accounts of the </p><p>company and seized cash totaling approximately Burmese Kyat </p><p>31 million (i.e., USD 31,000). </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Burmese police have not hesitated to use the </p><p>powers granted by the money laundering law.  What is </p><p>surprising is that, at least to date, they have been careful </p><p>to ensure that the law is applied only in clearly criminal </p><p>cases.  This is important, because the powers in the law are </p><p>truly extraordinarily.  Basically, it states that the </p><p>government has the right to seize the funds or property of </p><p>anyone who cannot "clearly prove with valid evidence" how he </p><p>obtained the money or property in question.  Since almost no </p><p>one can prove the source of funds in Burma, where </p><p>record-keeping is a lost art, this means, in effect, that all </p><p>funds on deposit in the banking system are potentially at </p><p>risk and any indiscriminate investigations could provoke a </p><p>panic.  Sensitive to this, police have focused on clearly </p><p>criminal cases, at least to date.  Nevertheless they have </p><p>produced some striking results and could produce more as they </p><p>become more familiar with financial investigations. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
