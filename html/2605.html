<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000788 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, LI, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: LEGAL DIRECTOR LALOUPO GIVES A LIBERIA </p><p>UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 622 </p><p>     B. MONROVIA 396 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) PolMilOff and OIG Inspector Paul Tyson March 6 met </p><p>ECOWAS Director of Legal Affairs Roger Laloupo. DAS Perry, </p><p>accompanied by PolMilOff, also met Laloupo and his Deputy, </p><p>Halima Ahmed, on March 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Laloupo said the ECOWAS-sponsored Liberia meeting was </p><p>still set for March 14-16, but was not confirmed due to </p><p>difficulty in contacting the various parties.  Contrary to </p><p>what Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf told us (Ref a), Laloupo remarked </p><p>that the March meeting would be a preparatory session to </p><p>allow the stakeholders to set a venue, date and agenda for </p><p>the actual reconciliation meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Laloupo confirmed ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas </p><p>and Nigerian Minister of Integration and Cooperation in </p><p>Africa Bimbola Ogunkelu had traveled to Monrovia to garner </p><p>President Taylor\'s assent to the meeting.  They later went to </p><p>Dakar to elicit President Wade\'s approval.  After a stop-over </p><p>in Libya, the two traveled on to Addis Ababa for a meeting on </p><p>NEPAD. (Laloupo added that the Secretariat had just faxed a </p><p>list of possible meeting participants to Chambas in Addis for </p><p>vetting.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Laloupo lamented ECOWAS\' inability to convince Liberia </p><p>to accept its help in working towards national reconciliation </p><p>and the restructuring of the Liberian armed forces after the </p><p>end of the Liberian civil war.  Since that effort had been </p><p>unsuccessful, he sighed, problems that contributed to the war </p><p>remained largely unresolved would have to be faced now, </p><p>particularly with elections approaching. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ahmed, who had visited Monrovia during the war and </p><p>then again recently, opined that the country looked worse </p><p>now.  Unfortunately, she remarked, President Taylor could </p><p>point to sanctions and the rebels and likely avoid </p><p>culpability when election season rolled around.  The only </p><p>hope of a real election challenge to Taylor was if the </p><p>opposition parties coalesced, though that seemed unlikely. </p><p>When Ambassador Perry emphasized concern that many opposition </p><p>figures feared returning to Liberia without security </p><p>guarantees, Ahmed agreed, suggesting that ECOWAS might have </p><p>to consider providing security to opposition politicians </p><p>similar to that provided Hutu moderates in Burundi by the </p><p>South African military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) DAS Perry joined Ambassador Jeter for a March 7 lunch </p><p>with Alhaji Kromah, former leader of ULIMO-K, who also claims </p><p>to have the loyalty of LURD fighters.  On the issue of a fair </p><p>electoral process, Kromah thought it possible only if Charles </p><p>Taylor were not around.  Kromah planned to attend the March </p><p>14-16 conference but expected nothing material to be </p><p>achieved.  He felt that the only solution was to continue to </p><p>apply pressure on Taylor to leave office and the country. </p><p>Kromah suggested that the way to get Taylor\'s attention and </p><p>inspire greater political flexibility was to publicly make </p><p>known the possibility that consideration might be given to </p><p>bringing Taylor before the Sierra Leone Special Court for his </p><p>role in the RUF-driven civil war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: Laloupo\'s characterization is the first we </p><p>have heard that the meeting might be preparatory and not </p><p>substantive.  Laloupo admitted not having the latest details </p><p>from Chambas, but is usually in the loop.  It is possible </p><p>that concerns raised by President Taylor and perhaps </p><p>President Wade made ECOWAS to lower the bar for the Abuja </p><p>meeting.  Whether the meeting is preparatory or substantive, </p><p>time is running out to prepare for the session and to invite </p><p>the necessary participants.  Many know of the session because </p><p>of the hyperactive Liberian grapevine and will attend without </p><p>a formal invitation.  However, if this meeting is a bust it </p><p>may sap the momentum for a regionally inspired reconciliation </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) DAS Perry cleared this message. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
