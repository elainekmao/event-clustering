<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002106 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER SAYS U.S. IS FINANCING "ANTI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT NGOS" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The September 17 edition of the government- </p><p>      controlled daily Bulawayo "Chronicle" carries a page- </p><p>      one, above-the-fold story entitled "Unholy alliance: </p><p>      Washington finances anti-government NGOs."  Excerpts </p><p>      follow. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The U.S. Government is assisting non- </p><p>      governmental organizations in Zimbabwe to open off- </p><p>      shore accounts in the British Isles so that they can </p><p>      circumvent exchange control regulations and conceal </p><p>      their sources of funding, `Chronicle\' learnt this </p><p>      week.  The Open Society Institute for Southern Africa </p><p>      (OSISA), funded by Hungarian-born American </p><p>      billionaire, Mr. George Soros, has been financing </p><p>      pirate radio stations in Zimbabwe in a bid to </p><p>      destabilize the country. Investigations by `Chronicle\' </p><p>      have revealed that the U.S. Agency for International </p><p>      Development (USAID) has, through an agent identified </p><p>      as Brett Hurst, been assisting NGOs to open off-shore </p><p>      accounts in the British Isles where millions of </p><p>      dollars in `aid\' have been wired to Zimbabwe.  Mr. </p><p>      David Lush, the OSISA representative in Southern </p><p>      Africa, has been coordinating financing for anti- </p><p>      government NGOs from his base in Johannesburg. </p><p> </p><p>      "`Chronicle\' has established that America </p><p>      played a pivotal role in financing anti- </p><p>      government pirate radio stations with its </p><p>      destabilization wing - the Office of </p><p>      Transitional Initiatives (OTS) - heavily </p><p>      involved in fanning `hate propaganda\' prior to </p><p>      the March presidential elections.  Two U.S. </p><p>      senators also secretly slipped into the country </p><p>      in June last year and met representatives of </p><p>      the Radio Dialogue Trust FM at a Bulawayo </p><p>      hotel.  Three nationals, Messrs Eden Egan from </p><p>      PACT - an arm of USAID, Hurst and Scott (from </p><p>      the OTI) - have been instrumental in </p><p>      coordinating NGO activity in the country.  The </p><p>      U.S. government has announced it is working </p><p>      with South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana to </p><p>      topple the government of Zimbabwe.  But the </p><p>      three Southern African states have flatly </p><p>      denied the claims. . .  Sources alleged that </p><p>      Mr. Hurst is an agent of USAID and assists NGOs </p><p>      to open offshore accounts so that they can </p><p>      circumvent exchange control regulations and </p><p>      conceal their sources of funding. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
