<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 21902 </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR DOUG PAAL </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA FINNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRC GOALS AFTER TIANANMEN:  THE </p><p>          OFFICIAL VIEW FROM THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE </p><p>OFFICIAL, THE PRC NOW HAS FOUR PRESSING GOALS: </p><p>COMPLETE ERADICATION OF "COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>ELEMENTS"; CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC OPENNESS AND </p><p>REFORM; POLITICAL EDUCATION OF THE MASSES; AND THE </p><p>WEEDING OUT OF CORRUPTION.  ZHAO\'S LAXITY AND </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN PRINCIPLES HAD LED TO </p><p>COUNTER-REVOLUTION, A MISTAKE THAT THE NEW LEADERSHIP </p><p>WOULD NOT REPEAT.  WELCOMING SECRETARY BAKER\'S </p><p>MEETING IN PARIS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL STRESSED THAT CHINA\'S POLICY OF OPENNESS TO </p><p>THE OUTSIDE WORLD REMAINED UNCHANGED DESPITE EFFORTS </p><p>TO PUNISH THE PRC FOR EVENTS OF JUNE 3-4.  WHILE THE </p><p>OFFICIAL REPEATEDLY STRESSED THE LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>DETERMINATION TO CHECK CORRUPTION, HE REVEALED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET DRAWN UP THE REGULATIONS </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT THE CAMPAIGN -- AND TACITLY ADMITTED </p><p>THAT THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD HAVE LOTS OF LOOPHOLES </p><p>WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY PROMULGATED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON AUGUST 8, POLOFFS MET WITH ZHANG YAOCHEN, </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE.  ZHANG, A PRE-CRACKDOWN </p><p>CONTACT OF THE EMBASSY, HAD CAREFULLY PREPARED A </p><p>LENGTHY PRESENTATION ON THE STEPS THE PRC LEADERSHIP </p><p>HAS TAKEN SINCE THE TIANANMEN CRACKDOWN TO SOLIDIFY </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY RULE. </p><p> </p><p>CRUSHING THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ZHANG NOTED THAT THE CCP HAD WON A "DECISIVE" </p><p>VICTORY AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS </p><p>WHO WERE TRYING TO OVERTHROW CHINA\'S SOCIALIST </p><p>SYSTEM.  THE AUTHORITIES HAD RESTORED ORDER </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THE SITUATION HAD </p><p>STABILIZED.  STILL, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO CONTINUE </p><p>ITS EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ZHANG SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET </p><p>ARRESTED ALL THOSE WHO HAD HELPED ORGANIZE THE </p><p>COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CONSPIRACY, ADVOCATED BOURGEOIS </p><p>LIBERALIZATION, LIAISED WITH HOSTILE FOREIGN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, OR ENGAGED IN LOOTING, ARSON, AND </p><p>MURDER.  SO LONG AS THAT WERE THE CASE, MARTIAL LAW </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE IN BEIJING.  ZHANG NOTED THAT CHINESE </p><p>PEOPLE WERE NOT NEARLY AS CONCERNED AS FOREIGNERS </p><p>ABOUT HOW LONG MARTIAL LAW WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ZHANG, MOST CHINESE VIEWED MARTIAL LAW </p><p>MERELY AS A MEANS TO ENSURE THAT THE SITUATION </p><p>REMAINED CALM. </p><p> </p><p>6.   ZHANG REFUSED TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH LONGER IT </p><p>WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNMENT TO ROUND UP ALL THE </p><p>UNDESIRABLES AND WEAPONS.  HE ALSO SAID HE DID NOT </p><p>KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN ARRESTED OR SENT TO </p><p>PRISON AND WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY </p><p>COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES REMAINED AT LARGE. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ZHANG STRESSED THAT ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC REFORM HAD </p><p>LED TO SOME SOCIAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS UNEVEN </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, IT WAS THE ONLY PATH THAT </p><p>CHINA COULD FOLLOW.  ECONOMIC OPENNESS MUST CONTINUE </p><p>IF CHINA WERE TO DEVELOP.  ACCORDINGLY, CHINA WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE </p><p>WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THUS, THE PRC LEADERSHIP WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>"DISTORTED" ACCOUNTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA OF </p><p>THE TURMOIL IN BEIJING HAD LED SOME WESTERN COUNTRIES </p><p>TO IMPOSE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  IN CONTRAST, ZHANG </p><p>SAID, MOST OF THE THIRD WORLD HAD SUPPORTED CHINA\'S </p><p>POSITION THAT THE TIANANMEN INCIDENT HAD BEEN </p><p>STRICTLY AN INTERNAL AFFAIR.  SANCTIONS WERE DOOMED </p><p>TO FAIL, ZHANG SAID.  HE NOTED THAT WESTERN NATIONS </p><p>WERE ALREADY RESUMING NORMAL CONTACTS WITH BEIJING </p><p>AND WERE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD "REALLY" </p><p>HAPPENED IN BEIJING.  ZHANG POINTED, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>TO FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN\'S MEETING WITH SECRETARY </p><p>BAKER WHICH, ZHANG ASSERTED, STRONGLY UNDERLINED THE </p><p>FUTILITY OF TRYING TO ISOLATE CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ZHANG MORE THAN ONCE REITERATED HIS DESIRE FOR </p><p>FRIENDLY SINO-U.S. RELATIONS.  HE REGRETTED THE </p><p>CANCELLATION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S VISIT TO </p><p>CHINA, BUT SAID THAT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE LOOKED </p><p>FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONTACT WITH THE U.S.  ZHANG </p><p>STRESSED THAT, WHILE TWO COUNTRIES MIGHT DISAGREE ON </p><p>CERTAIN ISSUES BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT HISTORIES, </p><p>CULTURES, AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS, CONTINUED DIALOGUE WAS </p><p>NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>EDUCATING THE MASSES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ACCORDING TO ZHANG, WHEN DENG XIAOPING  HAD </p><p>BEGUN HIS POLICY OF OPENNESS TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE </p><p>WORLD, HE HAD INSISTED THAT IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE EMPHASIZED IN ORDER TO INSULATE </p><p>CHINA FROM CORRUPTING FOREIGN INFLUENCES. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, ZHANG NOTED, ZHAO ZIYANG, WHILE HE WAS </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE PARTY, HAD SADLY NEGLECTED </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING OF THE MASSES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE NEW LEADERSHIP HAD LEARNED FROM ZHAO\'S </p><p>MISTAKES AND WOULD RELENTLESSLY PUSH FORWARD WITH </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING.  THE TRAINING WOULD EMPHASIZE </p><p>THE FOUR CARDINAL PRINCIPLES:  KEEPING TO THE </p><p>SOCIALIST ROAD; UPHOLDING THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE </p><p>PROLETARIAT; UPHOLDING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY; AND UPHOLDING MARXISM-LENINISM AND </p><p>MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT.  ZHANG NOTED THAT PROPAGANDA </p><p>MEETINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE A CONTINUOUS PROCESS.  "THE </p><p>LESSONS THEY TEACH ARE FORGOTTEN QUICKLY." </p><p> </p><p>12.  ZHANG SAID THAT HE SAW NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN </p><p>A PROFESSED POLICY OF OPENNESS AND A CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>BOURGEOIS LIBERALIZATION.  HE ARGUED THAT THE THE </p><p>LATTER WAS NOT INTENDED TO EXCLUDE ALL WESTERN </p><p>THOUGHT, BUT RATHER TO EDUCATE THE CHINESE PEOPLE SO </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE AND REJECT </p><p>UNSUITABLE IDEAS. </p><p> </p><p>ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  ZHANG LAID GREATEST EMPHASIS ON THE CENTRAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S DETERMINATION TO WEED OUT CORRUPTION. </p><p>CORRUPTION, WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN A PROBLEM IN </p><p>POST-LIBERATION CHINA, HAD FLOURISHED UNDER ZHAO, WHO </p><p>LOOKED UPON IT AS "INEVITABLE" IF CHINA WERE TO </p><p>PURSUE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IN CONTRAST, ZHANG </p><p>SAID, THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP REALIZED THAT </p><p>COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS HAD USED THE </p><p>CORRUPTION ISSUE TO UNDERMINE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  CORRUPTION THUS HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER </p><p>CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ZHANG MAINTAINED THAT ONE IMPORTANT REASON WHY </p><p>THIS ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN WOULD SUCCEED WHILE THE </p><p>1987 ONE HAD FAILED WAS THAT IT WOULD START AT THE </p><p>VERY HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND WORK ITS WAY </p><p>DOWN.  PEOPLE WOULD SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>SERIOUS ABOUT FIGHTING CORRUPTION AND SPECIAL </p><p>PRIVILEGES AMONG HIGH-LEVEL CADRES, AND WOULD THUS BE </p><p>INSPIRED TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE CAMPAIGN AT LOWER </p><p>LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ZHANG ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>NOT YET PREPARED THE REGULATIONS NECESSARY TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE 7-POINT ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN WHICH </p><p>THE POLITBURO HAD ANNOUNCED ON JULY 28.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>IT WAS DIF FICULT TO DETERMINE WHO SHOULD BE AFFECTED </p><p>BY THE BAN ON HIGH-LEVEL CADRES\' CHILDREN ENGAGING IN </p><p>BUSINESS -- AND INDEED, WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES </p><p>SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BAN.  (NOTE:  THE POLITBURO </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT SINGLED OUT THE CHILDREN AND SPOUSES OF </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL POLITICAL BUREAU, THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT AND THE STANDING COMMITTEE -- A </p><p>FORMULATION THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE DENG XIAOPING\'S </p><p>CHILDREN, NOR A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAVE PROFITTED </p><p>FROM OFFICIAL CONNECTIONS.)  SIMILARLY, THE BAN ON </p><p>THE IMPORT OF FOREIGN-MADE CARS ALSO COULD NOT BE </p><p>INTERPRETED TOO RIGIDLY.  "THAT, TOO, COULD LEAD TO A </p><p>WASTE OF MONEY."  ZHANG SAID THAT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE, ALONG WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND PARTY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, WAS STUDYING THESE QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  ZHANG\'S REMARKS WERE A CAREFULLY PREPARED </p><p>PRESENTATION OF CCP GOALS DURING THE POST-CRACKDOWN </p><p>PERIOD.  ZHANG SPOKE VIRTUALLY NON-STOP FOR ALMOST </p><p>NINETY MINUTES, NOTING THAT ANY QUESTIONS POLOFFS </p><p>MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE ANSWERED IN THE COURSE OF HIS </p><p>COMMENTS.  READERS OF THE CHINESE PRESS WILL FIND </p><p>MOST OF HIS COMMENTS FAMILIAR.  ZHANG, LIKE THE </p><p>PRESS, WAS LONG ON THEORY AND SHORT ON DETAILS AND </p><p>FACTS.  HIS PRESENTATION, HOWEVER, MADE IT CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE PRC VIEWS THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN AS </p><p>KEY IN ITS EFFORTS TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE </p><p>CHINESE PEOPLE.  THUS, WE WERE STRUCK THAT NEARLY TWO </p><p>WEEKS AFTER AFTER THE POLITUBRO ANNOUNCED ITS </p><p>SEVEN-POINT ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAM, THE CAMPAIGN, AT </p><p>LEAST AS PRESENTED BY THE JUSTICE MINISTRY,  CONSISTS </p><p>LARGELY OF RHETORIC -- WITH PLENTY OF LOOPHOLES FOR </p><p>WELL-CONNECTED CADRES AND THEIR RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
