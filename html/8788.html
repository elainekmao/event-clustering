<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001063 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/RA, PM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, MARR, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR REAPPORTIOMENT OF FMF </p><p> </p><p>1.  During the recent visit of the PACOM J4, Brigadier </p><p>General James Kennon to Colombo, Post learned that India may </p><p>not accept five million dollars in Foreign Military Funding </p><p>(FMF) from the US government for a variety of reasons.  If </p><p>India does in fact not need the FMF, Post requests </p><p>consideration of reapportionment of the five million into </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s FMF account.  Post\'s original request for 15 </p><p>million of FMF in support of programs recommended by the </p><p>2002 US DoD assessments was reduced to 1 million in the </p><p>final interagency. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The five million dollars of FMF would go a long way to </p><p>strengthening the Sri Lankan military in the face of the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a State Department Foreign </p><p>Declared Terrorist Organization.  As combatting terrorism is </p><p>a national level and PACOM priority, assistance to the Sri </p><p>Lankan military in containing LTTE terrorists in Sri Lanka </p><p>supports Post\'s Mission plan and PACOM\'s theater Security </p><p>Cooperation plan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POC is LTC Richard S. Girven, Defense Attache tel 94-1- </p><p>448007, ext 2442. </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
