<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002686 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/OP/AF AND DS/DSS/ITA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OFDP, ASEC, EU, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: NIGERIA: EU TROIKA\'S CALL ON THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RE: SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b), </p><p>(d), (g). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On October 16, the EU Troika (the Belgian and Spanish </p><p>Ambassadors, and Head of the European Commission Delegation), </p><p>called on Ambassador Jeter to discuss ongoing events in </p><p>Nigeria in light of September 11 and the coalition response </p><p>in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Belgian Ambassador Jozef Smets, currently representing </p><p>the EU Presidency, informed the Ambassador that the Troika </p><p>had reached out to Muslim leaders, most recently the Chairman </p><p>of the Assembly of Muslims of Nigeria.  They found the </p><p>Assembly Chairman to be moderate and reasonable, but very </p><p>interested in evidence against Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. </p><p>Unfortunately, a "smoking gun" was unavailable.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter recalled his similar experience with the Chief Imam of </p><p>the National Mosque in Abuja (septel).  In addition to </p><p>seeking evidence, many interlocutors had the Middle East </p><p>peace process in the back of their minds, the Ambassador </p><p>continued.  The Emir of Ilorin, on the other hand, had been </p><p>nothing but supportive (septel).  The Troika and Ambassador </p><p>agreed on the need to get the message out to more moderate </p><p>Muslim leaders in Nigeria.  (COMMENT: Embassy is developing a </p><p>list of 20 or so key Muslim leaders for this effort, and will </p><p>share information with EU colleagues, as appropriate.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Smets raised the possibility of periodic inter-Mission </p><p>meeting between senior personnel to manage issues related to </p><p>ongoing events, particularly to discuss evacuation scenarios </p><p>and security.  Ambassador Jeter responded that his DCM had </p><p>met with counterparts from the British, Canadian, Dutch and </p><p>German Missions, and a group of RSOs also had started </p><p>meeting.  This could be expanded to include other EU Missions </p><p>following consultations within this core group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GON support for the safety of diplomats and diplomatic </p><p>facilities appeared strong, Jeter stated.  The will was </p><p>there, although one had to be realistic about GON </p><p>capabilities.  If a domestic conflict spread to multiple </p><p>areas in the country, the GON\'s ability to respond could be </p><p>quickly eroded.  However, after the riots in Kaduna and the </p><p>resulting attacks on Hausas in the East, the GON appeared </p><p>better prepared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that President Obasanjo had </p><p>recently said he was most concerned about Kano, Zamfara, </p><p>Sokoto and Kaduna.  He had asked the President to add Lagos </p><p>to his list.  The Troika agreed strongly.  The Spanish </p><p>Ambassador noted that Obasanjo dislikes Lagos, so he ignores </p><p>it.  The Ambassador and the Troika briefly discussed the </p><p>conflict in Kano, agreeing that the causes were multiple, </p><p>including economic, ethnic and religious factors.  The </p><p>Ambassadors agreed that they should meet periodically to </p><p>exchange views on security issues, perhaps at least once </p><p>every two weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: This was the second meeting between the </p><p>Embassy and the EU Troika, the first being a condolence call </p><p>on the Charge shortly after September 11.  We are pleased </p><p>that our European colleagues are equally focused on outreach </p><p>to moderate Muslim leaders, and interested in working </p><p>together toward this mutual objective.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
