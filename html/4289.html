ANKARA 7775 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7550 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7509 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 7148 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Operation Northern Watch POLAD met with Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front (ITF) Ankara rep and Executive Committee member Dr. </p><p>Mustafa Ziya November 12.  Ziya said that although the </p><p>opposition conference steering committee had increased the </p><p>number of Turkmen seats, the total number of seats had also </p><p>been increased.  The Turkmen, Ziya said, still end up with </p><p>only 6 percent.  He complained that at the 1999 New York </p><p>meeting the ITF got all of the Turkmen seats, but for the </p><p>Brussels conference 2 percent were being given to Turkmen </p><p>Islamists, 2 percent to KDP-friendly Turkmen and only 2 </p><p>percent to the ITF.  Ziya said that the ITF wanted to </p><p>participate, but would not do so unless the situation were </p><p>fixed.  He said that the ITF could live with 6 percent of the </p><p>seats, and even with sharing those with the Turkmen </p><p>Islamists.  However, the ITF would not participate if the </p><p>KDP-friendly Turkmen were attending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Dr. Ziya Names Names </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ziya said that the Turkmen the ITF objected to are: </p><p>Walid Sharika, Turkmen Brotherhood Party; Saifat din Damerji, </p><p>Turkmen Union Party; Jawdat Najar, Kurdistan Turkmen Cultural </p><p>Association and minister in the Kurdistan Regional </p><p>Government; and Shirzat Oza\'iri, Democratic Turkmen Party of </p><p>Kurdistan.  Ziya alleged that Sharika and Oza\'iri were not </p><p>really Turkmen at all and worked for KDP intel services, and </p><p>that Oza\'iri and din Damerji participated in the GOI\'s Anfal </p><p>campaign against the Kurds.  All these individuals and their </p><p>groups had, Ziya said, at most a few dozen supporters (the </p><p>ITF, he said was "a thousand times" bigger) and received </p><p>their salaries from the KDP.  It was, he said, impossible for </p><p>the ITF to agree to sit with them as part of the Turkmen </p><p>delegation to the conference.  Ziya said these four </p><p>individuals really represented the KDP, and that the KDP was </p><p>using its position on the steering committee to "stack the </p><p>deck" in its favor at the conference.  He urged the US to </p><p>press the KDP to get these individuals removed from the </p><p>invitation list. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ITF Seeks USG Intervention to Reign-in KDP </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ziya said the ITF\'s impression was that the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds and Shi\'a were controlling the steering committee.  It </p><p>would, he said, be useful for the USG to discuss the </p><p>conference problems with the "group of nine" (the steering </p><p>committee plus the ITF and Assyrians - we are unsure who </p><p>number 9 is).  Ziya said the ITF rep in London would be </p><p>meeting with Iraqi National Congress leader Ahmed Chalabi to </p><p>discuss the conference, but would be in a listening mode and </p><p>would not try to form an alliance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ziya also told us that per Ref A, the ITF had decided </p><p>to appoint him ITF representative responsible for external </p><p>relations.  An official announcement will be made November </p><p>16. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
