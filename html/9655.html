<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 002115 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NP/RA, NP/MNA, IO/T, NEA/NGA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, MNUC, PREL, IR, CA, IAEA, Iran, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: CANADA AGREES ON NEED TO MOVE UP EL </p><p>BARADEI REPORT BUT DOUBTS AUGUST 15 IS DOABLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 210913 (B) OTTAWA 1670 (C) OTTAWA 2109 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada agrees with us that the IAEA Director General\'s </p><p>next report on Iran needs to be issued prior to August 29 in </p><p>order to mount an effective campaign before the September </p><p>8-12 Board of Governors meeting (ref. A), but believes that </p><p>August 15 may not be feasible.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs\' </p><p>Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, told us on July 23 </p><p>that the extended absences of El Baradei and of Deputy DG </p><p>Goldschmidt (who will be returning from leave on August 18) </p><p>and the need for a thorough report will make it difficult for </p><p>the IAEA to proceed two weeks earlier.  But Wood said that we </p><p>must have more time to prepare for this BOG meeting than we </p><p>had in June, when the DG\'s Iran report came out on the 6th </p><p>and the BOG meeting was held on the 16th.  Exactly how far in </p><p>advance of August 29 is the challenge. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Wood said that Canada has an added complication if the </p><p>DG\'s report is moved up to August 15.  Another GoC agency is </p><p>preparing to provide "sensitive information" on Iran to the </p><p>IAEA Secretariat, and had not planned to do so before </p><p>mid-August (the Secretariat\'s informal deadline for </p><p>submissions to be considered in the report is August 15). </p><p>Wood was unsure whether or how much the sharing of this </p><p>information, which was out of Foreign Affairs\' hands, could </p><p>be accelerated.  Wood was not suggesting the report be held </p><p>up on account of this, but said that Canada wanted to bring </p><p>the information to bear on the report if at all possible. </p><p>(NOTE: Canada has not previously shared intelligence with the </p><p>IAEA, and is grappling with how to do so.  The GoC has </p><p>informed us (ref. B) that it has intelligence from the late </p><p>1990s regarding nuclear activity at Kalaye.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The GoC continues to push both the Iranian Government </p><p>and the IAEA on full disclosure and full accountability. </p><p>Wood said that Canada\'s Ambassador in Vienna is meeting with </p><p>IAEA Acting DG Waller on July 24 to reiterate Canadian </p><p>concerns, including moving up issuance of the Iran report, </p><p>maintaining a rigorous approach to inspections, and using all </p><p>the IAEA\'s tools, including special inspections.  Wood told a </p><p>Secretariat official earlier this month that if Iran did not </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>agree to environmental sampling at Kalaye, Canada would push </p><p>for a special inspection to be conducted there.  Wood was </p><p>preparing a letter from Minister Graham to El Baradei </p><p>reiterating these messages, and said that Graham discussed </p><p>Canadian concerns again this month with Iranian FM Kharazzi. </p><p>He noted that Canadian access in Tehran will be more limited </p><p>now that the Canadian Ambassador has been recalled over the </p><p>death in custody of Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi </p><p>(ref. C). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Overall, Wood was pessimistic about bringing Iran </p><p>around.  He noted that experts who travelled with El Baradei </p><p>to Iran this month had returned early because of the lack of </p><p>cooperation by the Iranians.  Wood said that the IAEA\'s </p><p>investigation was showing additional Iranian work with </p><p>nuclear materials that had not been declared. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
