(C) SUMMARY: DURING AN HOUR AND A HALF MEETING </p><p>NOVEMBER 28 MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE SOUGHT AMBASSADOR MCDONALD\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PRACTICAL ADVICE ON HOW TO ENSURE THAT UNDP </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN\'S VISIT TO ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>A SUCCESS.  THE PERMANENT SECRETARY SAID HE WAS LOOKING </p><p>FOR WAYS TO BUILD PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CONFIDENCE IN ORDER </p><p>TO ACCEPT CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WILL HAVE WITH RESPECT ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM, AND SOUGHT A SIGNAL FROM THE USG TO BOLSTER THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR\'S MISSION.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO CONSULT WITH WASHINGTON REGARDING HIS REQUEST, </p><p>BUT ADVISED THE PRESIDENT NOT TO BE DEFENSIVE AND </p><p>READILY AGREE TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARM OCCUPATIONS.  CHIWEWE TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT MUGABE WANTED TO SPEND SOME SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>TIME WITH MALLOCH-BROWN AND WOULD GIVE THOSE KINDS OF </p><p>ASSURANCES.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>CLEAREST SIGNAL PRESIDENT MUGABE COULD SEND TO THE WEST </p><p>DEMONSTRATING HIS SERIOUSNESS WOULD BE TO CALL ON THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS TO LEAVE THE FARMS, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>SAID THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE UNDER THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  INSTEAD, HE SUGGESTED AN ACCELERATED </p><p>ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PROCESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>CHIWEWE HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE IN SERIOUS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNDP AND GENUINELY WANTS USG </p><p>INPUT.  IF WE COULD REPACKAGE THE UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED </p><p>IN THE 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE AND SECURE ADDITIONAL </p><p>PLEDGES, WE MIGHT HAVE A WIN-WIN PROPOSITION ON OUR </p><p>HANDS.  CHIWEWE SEEMED TO TAKE OUR POINTS ON BOARD AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06661  01 OF 02  281642Z </p><p>THE ATMOSPHERICS WERE EXCELLENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING A ONE AND A HALF-HOUR MEETING NOVEMBER 28 </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD </p><p>CHIWEWE INFORMED AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>BUSY MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE NOVEMBER 30 VISIT OF </p><p>UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN.  ON NOVEMBER 27 </p><p>HE HAD CONSULTED UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR </p><p>ANGELO AND ZIMBABWEAN PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS TICHAONA JOKONYA, AND THOUGHT HE SHOULD </p><p>TOUCH BASE WITH THE "CHIEF GLOBAL PLAYER," SO HE ASKED </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR TO COME OVER FOR A PRACTICAL DISCUSSION </p><p>ABOUT HOW TO GET SOMETHING DONE. CHIWEWE CAME STRAIGHT </p><p>TO HIS POINT: HE ASKED WHETHER THE USG COULD "GIVE A </p><p>SIGNAL" TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE THAT MALLOCH-BROWN </p><p>IS SERIOUS AND THAT THE DONOR COMMUNITY SUPPORTS HIM. </p><p>THE PERMANENT SECRETARY HAD ASKED ANGELO WHETHER THE </p><p>UNDP COULD CONTRIBUTE A SYMBOLIC AMOUNT TO THE FUND FOR </p><p>LAND REFORM, BUT THE LATTER UNDERSTANDABLY MADE NO </p><p>COMMITMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD REPLIED THAT HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO CONSULT WITH WASHINGTON REGARDING HIS REQUEST.  THAT </p><p>SAID, THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS </p><p>A "CRITICAL, CRITICAL" MEETING, BECAUSE ZIMBABWE WAS AT </p><p>A FORK IN THE ROAD.  HE TOLD CHIWEWE THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE SHOULD EMBRACE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. </p><p>THE PERMANENT SECRETARY THEN ASKED THE AMBASSADOR, "WHAT </p><p>DO YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO DO?"  CHIWEWE UNDERSCORED </p><p>THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR CANDID ADVICE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SAY TO MALLOCH-BROWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06661  01 OF 02  281642Z </p><p>THAT HE NEEDS SUPPORT FOR HIS LAND REFORM PROGRAM AND </p><p>SHOULD NOT ACT DEFENSIVELY. THE SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DIPLOMAT REPORTED THAT, AS A SIGN OF THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ATTACHED TO THE VISIT, HE HAD SAID THAT </p><p>HE WANTED "SOME REAL TIME WITH MR. BROWN."   CHIWEWE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET ALLIES TO BUILD </p><p>CONFIDENCE SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT FIND HIMSELF </p><p>"BENDING TO AN UNBENDING ENVIRONMENT."  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING MUGABE COULD DO </p><p>TO SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL TO THE WEST WOULD BE FOR HIM TO </p><p>GO TO HIS PORTICO AND CALL FOR THE WAR VETERANS TO LEAVE </p><p>THE FARMS IMMEDIATELY.  IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN 90 </p><p>PERCENT OF THEM WOULD DO SO, THE AMBASSADOR STATED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHILE CHIWEWE APPRECIATED THE SUGGESTION, HE </p><p>NOTED THAT MUGABE COULD NOT DO THAT, BECAUSE WHEN IT HAD </p><p>BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST, WAR VETERANS LEFT THE PREMISES </p><p>OF A FARM, BUT CAMPED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD ONLY TO </p><p>RETURN LATER.  IF WE HAD A CLEAR 5 MILLION AVAILABLE </p><p>HECTARES, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO </p><p>SAY ANYTHING, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY SAID.  INSTEAD, </p><p>CHIWEWE THOUGHT THE WAY TO PROCEED WOULD BE TO QUICKEN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6797 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06661  02 OF 02  281642Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     ACQ-00 </p><p>      CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   VCE-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------A4AEE7  281642Z /38 </p><p>O 281637Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7728 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006661 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.MCCALL AND AFR/SA FOR C.PALMA AND </p><p>M.WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAGR, UNDP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ASKS FOR USG GESTURE </p><p>ON LAND TO COINCIDE WITH MALLOCH-BROWN VISIT </p><p> </p><p>THE PACE THROUGH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT LEGALLY ACQUIRED </p><p>FARMS AND MOVED PEOPLE ONTO THOSE FARMS.  "IT HAS TO BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06661  02 OF 02  281642Z </p><p>ACQUISITION, REMOVAL, ACQUISITION, REMOVAL, IN ORDER TO </p><p>KEEP THE SITUATION CONTROLLED," HE ARGUED.  IF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WERE TO PROVOKE POLITICAL DISCONTENT WE COULD </p><p>ASSUME THAT "MISCHIEF BEGINS AMONG SUCH PEOPLE."  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR CAUTIONED THE PERMANENT SECRETARY THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD NOT PAY FOR LAND THAT </p><p>WOULD GO TO CRIMINALS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT MIGHT WISH TO MEET MALLOCH-BROWN FOR AN </p><p>EXTENDED PERIOD ON THURSDAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AND THEN </p><p>BEGIN DRAFTING A CLEAR STATEMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>PRINCIPLES, AFTER WHICH THE TWO WOULD MEET TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>IT.  CHIWEWE AGREED WITH THE CONCEPT, BUT SUGGESTED THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER AND MALLOCH-BROWN DO IT, AS THEY ARE ON </p><p>THE SAME LEVEL. THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT THE UNDP </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR NEEDED TO LEAVE ZIMBABWE BEING ABLE TO SAY </p><p>THAT HE MET PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>WANTS THE RULE OF LAW TO PREVAIL ON THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS.  HE WILL NEED THAT GUARANTEE FROM THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED.  "AND HE WILL GET IT," THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: IN HIS OWN BLUNT AND PECULIAR MANNER, </p><p>CHIWEWE IS ATTEMPTING TO BUILD BRIDGES FROM HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HE MUST HAVE </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S NOD TO ENGAGE IN THESE PRACTICAL </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  THE WORK HE HAS PUT IN PREPARING FOR THE </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN VISIT IS INDICATIVE OF THE IMPORTANCE HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO IT.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THOROUGH </p><p>PREPARATION LIKE THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER SUCH GATHERING. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06661  02 OF 02  281642Z </p><p>THE WAY WE SEE IT, THE GOVERNMENT EITHER WILL TAKE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY GIVEN BY THE VISIT TO DEFUSE TENSIONS AND </p><p>BEGIN A SANE LAND REFORM PROGRAM, OR STEP UP THE PACE </p><p>AND VIOLENCE OF THE CURRENT LAND GRAB.  WE NEED TO THINK </p><p>CREATIVELY OF WAYS WE CAN ENCOURAGE THE GOZ IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: WE CAN SUGGEST ONE WAY: TAKE </p><p>THE LAND AND REFORM RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM THAT THE GOZ </p><p>AND THE DONORS HAD AGREED TO IN 1998; THROW IN SOME NEW </p><p>PLEDGES (FROM DONORS AND THE CFU) TO GET THE GOZ UP TO </p><p>THE 5 MILLION HECTARES IT IS LOOKING FOR; "REPACKAGE" IT </p><p>COMPLETE WITH A CLEVER NEW NAME THAT SINGS "LAND TO THE </p><p>PEOPLE" TO ZIMBABWEANS AND "RULE OF LAW" TO CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND THE DONOR COMMUNITY; LET MUGABE DECLARE </p><p>VICTORY AND CALL THE WAR VETERANS OFF THE FARMS; AND GET </p><p>THE LAND PROGRAM BACK "ON-TRACK" AND THIS ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL TRANSITION OFF THE DIME.  WITH THE RIGHT </p><p>NEGOTIATING SKILLS, THIS COULD BE PULLED OFF IN AN </p><p>ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYONE NEEDS A WIN.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
