<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 05548 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, LE, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  SEPTEMBER 19 "ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR THE LIBERATION </p><p>          OF PALESTINE" COMMUNIQUE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIRUT 5502 </p><p> </p><p>1. FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF HAND-WRITTEN </p><p>COMMUNIQUE (ARABIC) DELIVERED THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 18 </p><p>TO BEIRUT DAILY NEWSPAPER "AN-NAHAR" AND PUBLISHED IN </p><p>THE PAPER\'S SEPTEMBER 19 EDITION.  COMMUNIQUE WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY A COLOR POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH OF BEIRUT </p><p>UNIVERSITY COLLEGE (BUC) HOSTAGES ALAN STEEN, JESSE </p><p>TURNER, ROBERT POLHILL AND MITHILESHWAR SINGH SEATED </p><p>TOGETHER.  EMBASSY HAS OBTAINED COPIES OF THE COMMUNIQUE </p><p>AND PHOTO AND WILL POUCH TO DEPARTMENT.  (NOTE:  REFTEL </p><p>IS TEXT OF SEPTEMBER 16 COMMUNIQUE FROM SAME GROUP.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT OF COMMUNIQUE: </p><p> </p><p>ATTENTION| </p><p> </p><p>PURSUANT TO THE POSITIVE INITIATIVE PROPOSED TO SOLVE </p><p>THE ISSUE OF THE HOSTAGES AND THE SUBSEQUENT RESPONSES </p><p>OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR </p><p>THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCES THE </p><p>FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>FIRST - THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS ENDING THE HOSTAGE </p><p>ISSUE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  RATHER, IT </p><p>COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MORAL AND HUMAN VALUES THAT </p><p>WE BELIEVE IN.  THE DAY WILL NEVER COME THAT WE </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF KILLING AND CRIME. </p><p>FOLLOWING A CAREFUL, ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE STUDY OF </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL DETENTE IN THE REGION, </p><p>HOWEVER, WE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE THIS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>FORWARD WITH A POSITIVE INITIATIVE REGARDING THE HOSTAGE </p><p>ISSUE, WHICH CONSTITUTES BOTH A PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION </p><p>IN THE CONTEXT OF REGIONAL EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A CHANCE FOR THE LEADING PERSONALITIES OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER AND THINK </p><p>RESPONSIBLY OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THIS ISSUE, FOR </p><p>THIS IS A CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER COME AGAIN.  ALL WE ASK </p><p>IN RETURN IS WHAT IS STIPULATED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS PACT </p><p>(SIC) REGARDING THE INTIFADA OF OUR HEROIC PALESTINIAN </p><p>PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND, AND NHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING THE DETENTE WHICH HAS BEGUN </p><p>IN THE REGION, ON THE OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>SECOND - THE JUST CAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE IS PART OF A </p><p>GREATER WHOLE; THE SUPPORT OF LEGAL RIGHTS IS PART OF A </p><p>GREATER WHOLE, AND THE ISSUE OF THE USE OF POWER AND </p><p>VIOLENCE OR INITIATIVES OF PEACE AND STABILTY ARE ALSO </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL.  THIS IS THE BASIS OF WHAT IS ACHIEVED </p><p>THROUGH OUR IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES.  WEAKNESS WAS NEVER </p><p>AN INCENTIVE FOR CHANGING OUR COURSE AND POWER HAS NEVER </p><p>FORCED ANY CHANGES.  WHAT IS NECESSITATED BY OUR </p><p>PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTALS IS WHAT WILL BE.  WE ARE </p><p>ALWAYS PREPARED FOR VIOLENCE AND FOR CALM AND PEACEFUL </p><p>ATTITUDES.  THIS IS A TIME OF POSITIVE RESPONSES.  DO </p><p>NOT WASTE THIS OPPORTUNITY THROUGH HAUGHTY WORDS THAT </p><p>PROVOKE US AND ENCOURAGE US TO DRAW BACK AND RESORT TO </p><p>VIOLENCE AND FORCE TO GAIN RECOGNITION.  THIS ISSUE MUST </p><p>BE SOLVED POSITIVELY AND THE ADMINISTRATION MUST ASSUME </p><p>ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>THIRD - WE ARE ASTONISHED AT THE RIDICULOUS DEALS MADE </p><p>BY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DUKAKIS IN ANNOUNCING THE </p><p>TRANSFER OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IN ORDER </p><p>TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF ZIONIST PRESSURE GROUPS IN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  HE HAS BLATANTLY DEFIED THE FEELINGS OF OUR </p><p>HEROIC PEOPLE AND THE MOSLEMS OF THE WORLD.  THIS </p><p>FOREBODES A DARK FUTURE.  WE DECLARE, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>JERUSALEM IS AN EVER-BURNING VOLCANO IN WHICH THE </p><p>AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL MELT.  UNTIL THEN, WE HAVE VARIOUS </p><p>POSITIONS.  WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS VIEW OF HIS </p><p>(DUKAKIS) DOES NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE.  THAT IS WHY IT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE </p><p>HOSTAGE ISSUE, OVER WHICH ALL THE SUITABLE CONDITIONS </p><p>FOR A SOLUTION ARE GATHERED. </p><p> </p><p>FINALLY, THE INITIATIVE IS STILL THERE AND EXISTS.  WE </p><p>ARE WAITING FOR RESPONSES, IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH WE WILL </p><p>DECIDE SUBSEQUENT STEPS, ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS </p><p>REQUIRED BY OUR GLORIOUS INTIFADA. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE BE UPON HE WHO SERVES THE TRUTH FOR THE TRUTH. </p><p> </p><p>(SIGNED) ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT OF COMMUNIQUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMPSON </p><p></p></div>
