<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 3, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 3, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet/Bolge/Tercuman/Milliyet: It is </p><p>reported that PKK-KADEK has expedited armament of </p><p>its militants in Northern Iraq by reinforcing </p><p>them with rockets and missiles. It is believed </p><p>that the PKK has been seeking chemical weapons, </p><p>too. Some 44 of these PKK militants had </p><p>surrendered to security forces during operations </p><p>in February and March 2003, while 192 had </p><p>deserted from the organization. It is believed </p><p>that the organization has 743 active members </p><p>within Turkey, and 4550 of its armed militants </p><p>are in northern Iraq. It is alleged that the </p><p>organization purchased a 5 kilo chemical </p><p>"substance" worth of Euro one million and brought </p><p>it to northern Iraq via Iran, and subsequently </p><p>has been keeping it under tight control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: In an interview with Washington </p><p>Post, a Kurdish leader, Nursirvan Mustafa, said </p><p>there were 6,000 underground fighters in Kirkuk </p><p>who were ready waiting for a nod from the US to </p><p>start an uprising in the town. Mustafa said he </p><p>did not know the reason why the US did not give </p><p>approval for the uprising.  The Kurdish leader </p><p>said the Kurds wanted to be active participants </p><p>in the war and "enhance their autonomy" in the </p><p>post-war restructuring of Iraq. Mustafa said the </p><p>total number of US troops in northern Iraq did </p><p>not exceed 3,000 for the time being, and that the </p><p>northern Front was still a "ghost front". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: Saddam Huseyin warned Celal </p><p>Talabani in northern Iraq that he should not </p><p>support the US in this war. In the message read </p><p>by his Information Minister, Saddam said to </p><p>Talabani: "I am warning you not to get engaged in </p><p>activities that you would regret. You and your </p><p>forces in alliance with the foreigners should </p><p>avoid warring against the Iraqi people and its </p><p>army." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: In a press release yesterday, a </p><p>DEHAP member, Osman Ozcelik, warned the Turkish </p><p>government not to use Kurds as a pretext for an </p><p>operation in northern Iraq.  He asked the Turkish </p><p>government to give up its paranoia about the </p><p>situation south of the Turkish border.  Ozcelik </p><p>added that "The existence of an autonomous </p><p>Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, and its </p><p>becoming one of the fundamental components of a </p><p>possible federation to be established, are a </p><p>reality of Iraq and an event that takes place </p><p>beyond our borders." Ozcelik said that the </p><p>portrayal of PKK-KADEK militants as an obstacle </p><p>to military operations in Iraq was not convincing </p><p>because those militants were positioned in camps </p><p>at Iraq-Iran border some 300 kilometers away from </p><p>the Turkish border. Ozcelik said necessary legal </p><p>changes should be made to enable PKK militants to </p><p>abandon their weapons and participate in </p><p>democratic life in Turkey, and that there was no </p><p>other way of removing PKK from being a danger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Evrensel: Abdullah Ocalan\'s lawyers went to </p><p>Gemlik Jandarma Station in order to visit their </p><p>client at Imrali Island, but were not allowed to </p><p>go to the island on the grounds of adverse </p><p>weather conditions. The lawyers returned to </p><p>Istanbul and announced that they had formally </p><p>requested the Justice Ministry buy a new boat. </p><p>Meantime, Diyarbakir DEHAP\'s Provincial Womens\' </p><p>Committee Organization members held a press </p><p>announcement in which they protested both against </p><p>the war and against Abdullah Ocalan\'s isolation, </p><p>calling for an end to the war and a general </p><p>amnesty. In Adana and Siirt, DEHAP\'s women </p><p>members protesting the war and Ocalan\'s isolation </p><p>handed out carnations. Of 20 suspects arrested on </p><p>the grounds of holding pro-Ocalan demonstrations </p><p>in Yuksekova, two persons, Nuri Kurt and Serbest </p><p>Abi, were ordered held on charges of assisting </p><p>and harboring PKK-KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Cumhuriyet/Bolge/Tercuman/Evrensel: On one </p><p>hand the US dispatches its military vehicles and </p><p>equipment from the region, but on the other, they </p><p>still keep their vehicles and equipment in the </p><p>three factories they have hired in the Organized </p><p>Industrial Zone nearby Kiziltepe.  In addition, </p><p>the U.S. has been building a helicopter pad at </p><p>the KIDAS yarn factory inside the Organized </p><p>Industrial Zone. The US continues shipping </p><p>vehicles and equipment from the bases in Mardin </p><p>and Tasucu of Mersin to Iskenderun port and </p><p>Incirlik Air Force Base. It is reported that more </p><p>Patriot batteries will be unloaded from a </p><p>freighter that is expected to dock at Tasucu port </p><p>today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Dunya: During his one-day visit to Ankara, </p><p>Secretary of State Colin Powell called on the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Turkish President, Prime Minister, Foreign </p><p>Minister, and Chief of TGS. Powell said they </p><p>would be in cooperation with Turkey in rebuilding </p><p>of Iraq, and that Turkey was an important member </p><p>of the coalition forces, and while emphasizing </p><p>Turkey\'s concerns about northern Iraq, the </p><p>Secretary of State remarked that "There is no </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>need for the Turkish soldiers to cross the </p><p>border." Turkey and the US agreed on the </p><p>following points, which will not require </p><p>parliamentary approval: humanitarian convoys will </p><p>go to northern Iraq via Turkey, and Turkey will </p><p>be the intermediary for the humanitarian relief </p><p>directed to Kirkuk; fuel for vehicles of US units </p><p>deployed in northern Iraq will be supplied from </p><p>Turkey, and will be carried in Turkish tankers; </p><p>Turkey will facilitate US search-and-rescue </p><p>operations in northern Iraq, from bases in </p><p>Turkey; Turkey\'s inspection regime along the </p><p>Iraqi border will be lightened, and the channels </p><p>for fuel trade with peshmergas will be reopened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Radikal/Turkiye/Hurriyet/Tercuman/ Mill </p><p>iyet: It is reported that a convoy of 25 Turkish </p><p>trucks carrying US military equipment passed </p><p>through Habur border gate and arrived in Erbil in </p><p>northern Iraq under US troops\' protection. The </p><p>TGS announced that permission had been granted </p><p>for 204 Hummer jeeps brought to Turkey under </p><p>modernization project to now cross into northern </p><p>Iraq. Milliyet reports that military vehicles and </p><p>equipment brought to Turkey under the site- </p><p>preparations agreement have to be taken out of </p><p>Turkey by May 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Milliyet: Gang members trying to extort </p><p>money from merchants and police arrested </p><p>businessmen in Adana at gunpoint. Based on a tip </p><p>that some persons were trying to collect money </p><p>for a promissory note a merchant was forced to </p><p>sign, the police launched an operation that led </p><p>to the arrest of the brothers Yusuf Demir and </p><p>Ismet Demir.  They were caught with weapons and 5 </p><p>billion Turkish lira in their possession.
