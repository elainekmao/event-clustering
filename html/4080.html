<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 005226 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON AND ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY BILL </p><p>WOODS </p><p>OES FOR HAROLD FOSTER, EB FOR KLEMM AND MALAC </p><p>USDA FOR ED SCARBROUGH, USDA/FAS FOR REICH/HUGHES, </p><p>USDA/APHIS FOR ENRIGHT/DUNAHAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05226  01 OF 02  250950Z </p><p>USAID FOR JOSETTE LEWIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAGR, SENV, FAO, WHO, SENV AORC, FAO, WHO </p><p>SUBJECT:  WFP BOARD DISCUSSION OF BIOTECH FOOD </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: DURING THE OCTOBER 21, 2002 DISCUSSION OF </p><p>BIOTECH ENGINEERED FOOD AID AT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, EU </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD ARGUED THAT WORKABLE </p><p>ALTERNATIVES TO BIOTECH ENGINEERED FOOD AID MUST BE FOUND </p><p>AND THAT THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT OF COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT OR </p><p>REJECT BIOTECH FOOD AID MUST BE RESPECTED.  THE EU ARGUED </p><p>IN FAVOR OF IMPLEMENTING "ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT" </p><p>BEFORE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL. </p><p>THE UNITED STATES SPOKE MOST FORCEFULLY ON BEHALF OF </p><p>THOSE WHO ARE IN DANGER OF STARVING (WITH SUPPORT FROM </p><p>CANADA AND JAPAN).  THE G-77 COUNTRIES STATED THAT THEY </p><p>HAD NOT HAD ADEQUATE TIME TO CONSIDER THIS COMPLEX ISSUE </p><p>AND WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT THEIR CAPITALS.  THE DUTCH, WHO </p><p>HAD REQUESTED THE ITEM BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD, PUSHED </p><p>FOR A STRONGER DECISION FROM THE BOARD THAN THE ONE </p><p>ADOPTED (TO "TAKE NOTE" OF THE PAPER AND "LOOK FORWARD" </p><p>TO FOLLOW UP MEASURES.)  THE OFFICERS OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>BOARD WILL LIKELY MEET TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE </p><p>NEXT EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETING IN FEBRUARY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT THE REQUEST OF THE NETHERLANDS DELEGATION, THE WFP </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD HAD BEFORE IT AN INFORMATION DOCUMENT </p><p>OUTLINING WFP POLICY CONCERNING BIOTECH ENGINEERED FOOD </p><p>AID.  THE ENSUING DISCUSSION ON OCTOBER 21, 2002 REVEALED </p><p>SERIOUS CONFUSION AND CONCERNS AMONG BOTH OECD DONOR AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05226  01 OF 02  250950Z </p><p>RECIPIENT COUNTRIES CONCERNING THE HEALTH AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT OF BIOTECH ENGINEERED FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE DUTCH, IN THEIR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS, </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WFP WAS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS FOOD </p><p>SAFETY NOR TRADE, BUT ARGUED THAT IT WAS THE FORUM TO </p><p>DISCUSS FOOD AID.  THEY EMPHASIZED THE RIGHT OF RECIPIENT </p><p>COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE FOOD AID ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>"INFORMED CONSENT" AND CALLED FOR PROVIDING WORKABLE </p><p>ALTERNATIVES TO BIOTECH FOOD AID.  NORWAY AND BELGIUM </p><p>ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD RESTRICT CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>PURCHASE NON-GMO FOOD ONLY.  SWITZERLAND NOTED THAT EVEN </p><p>IF FOOD WAS SAFE TO CONSUME, THE EFFECT ON BIODIVERSITY </p><p>WAS STILL UNCLEAR AND ADVOCATED MILLING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE EC REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT HE REALIZED THAT NON- </p><p>ACCEPTANCE POSED LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS SUCH THAT FOOD MIGHT </p><p>NOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO SAVE LIVES.  HOWEVER, GOVERNMENTS </p><p>SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO APPLY THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE TO </p><p>PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FROM BIOTECH MAIZE (PARTICULARLY BULK FOOD </p><p>AID BEING USED AS SEEDS WHICH WAS LIKELY TO CONTAMINATE </p><p>LOCAL VARIETIES WHICH WERE "BETTER ADAPTED.")    THE EC </p><p>ASKED DONORS TO GIVE CASH TO FUND LOCAL PROCUREMENT OF </p><p>FOOD AID.  THEY ALSO CALLED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT PROVISION OF THE CARTAGENA </p><p>PROTOCOL "BEFORE IT ENTERED INTO FORCE."  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE EC REPRESENTATIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE EU </p><p>ALLOWS THE IMPORT OF GM MAIZE FOR FOOD AND INTENTIONAL </p><p>INTRODUCTION INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND DOES NOT BAN THE </p><p>IMPORT OF ANIMALS FED ON GM MAIZE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05226  01 OF 02  250950Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE U.S. PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE, AMBASSADOR TONY </p><p>HALL, SPOKE FORCEFULLY IN FAVOR OF ACCEPTING BIOTECH </p><p>ENGINEERED FOOD AID TO PREVENT IMPENDING DISASTER IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA.  HE RECOUNTED THAT HE HAD VISITED THE </p><p>SUB-REGION LAST WEEK AND WITNESSED FIRST-HAND HOW </p><p>DESPERATE THE SITUATION WAS.  AMBASSADOR HALL STATED THAT </p><p>BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL BODIES WERE DEBATING GM FOOD IT WAS </p><p>CREATING FEAR AND CAUSING DELAYS IN GETTING ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE HUNGRY AND AS A RESULT, PEOPLE WOULD DIE.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>HALL POINTED OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD PREDICTED </p><p>THERE WOULD BE A CRISIS AND RESPONDED IN A TIMELY WAY </p><p>WITH DONATIONS OF TONS OF FOOD THAT IS EATEN BY MILLIONS </p><p>EVERY DAY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE.  THIS WAS </p><p>FOOD THAT HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO RIGOROUS TESTING FOR </p><p>SAFETY AND WHICH POSED NO KNOWN RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH. </p><p>RATHER, BIOTECH FOOD OFFERED HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3779 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05226  02 OF 02  250950Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   ANHR-00  EB-00    E-00     UTED-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      IO-00    OES-01   SS-00    TEST-00  SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------FE1116  250950Z /38 </p><p>R 250900Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6562 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION US IN NEW YORK NY </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2343 </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MASERU </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY MBABANE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2870 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005226 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON AND ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY BILL </p><p>WOODS </p><p>OES FOR HAROLD FOSTER, EB FOR KLEMM AND MALAC </p><p>USDA FOR ED SCARBROUGH, USDA/FAS FOR REICH/HUGHES, </p><p>USDA/APHIS FOR ENRIGHT/DUNAHAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05226  02 OF 02  250950Z </p><p>USAID FOR JOSETTE LEWIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, WHO, EAGR, SENV </p><p>SUBJECT:  WFP BOARD DISCUSSION OF BIOTECH FOOD </p><p> </p><p>7.  AMBASSADOR HALL MENTIONED THAT NO ONE HE MET IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA MENTIONED BIOTECH -- NOT NGO\'S, OR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LET ALONE POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES. </p><p>HE CLOSED BY NOTING THAT BOTH ACTION AND INACTION HAVE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES IN SUCH A SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE FEW REPRESENTATIVES OF THE G-77 THAT SPOKE VOICED </p><p>THEIR FRUSTRATION AT BEING CAUGHT IN THIS DILEMMA.  IRAN, </p><p>WHO CHAIRS THE G-77, SAID THE RECIPIENTS DON\'T KNOW IF </p><p>THERE IS A RISK OR NOT, THAT PEOPLE ARE FACED WITH THE </p><p>"CHOICE BETWEEN STARVING NOW OR DYING IN SIX MONTHS TIME </p><p>IF THEY CONSUME GMO\'S."  HE CALLED ON WFP TO BRING IN </p><p>EXPERTS TO INFORM THE MEMBERSHIP.  ZIMBABWE, WHO SPEAKS </p><p>FOR THE AFRICAN REGIONAL GROUP, SAID THE ISSUE WAS TOO </p><p>SENSITIVE TO DECIDE WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH CAPITALS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  AS EXPECTED, THE DISCUSSION OF BIOTECH </p><p>ENGINEERED FOOD AID DEGENERATED INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>"RISKS" -- TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- BY A </p><p>BODY THAT IS NOT EQUIPPED OR MANDATED TO HANDLE QUESTIONS </p><p>OF RISK ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT.  THE EU COUNTRIES </p><p>APPEAR TO BE LINING UP BEHIND THE "SOLUTION" OF </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL\'S "ADVANCE </p><p>INFORMED AGREEMENT" PROVISIONS PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO FORCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05226  02 OF 02  250950Z </p><p>OF THE AGREEMENT.  THE COMPLACENCY OF THIS APPROACH -- </p><p>WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION OF HOW AND WHY DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUCH AGREEMENT IS </p><p>SHOCKING WHEN THE HUMAN SUFFERING RESULTING FROM DELAYS </p><p>IS ALREADY THERE TO BE SEEN.
