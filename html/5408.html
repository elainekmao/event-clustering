END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00213  301332Z </p><p>2. USAID/CROATIA IS FUNDING ONE HIV/AIDS ACTIVITY WHICH </p><p>FOCUSES ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IN THE SEAPORT CITY </p><p>OF SPLIT.  IMPLEMENTATION IS THROUGH THE AMERICAN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HEALTH ALLIANCE (AIHA) IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE </p><p>CITY OF SPLIT AND A LOCAL NGO.  THE HIV/AIDS PROJECT </p><p>INCLUDES THREE INTERVENTION AREAS:  PEER-EDUCATION; </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY AWARENESS MATERIALS; AND A MASS </p><p>MEDIA CAMPAIGN.  TWO ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH NGOS WILL BE </p><p>FUNDED IN MID-MARCH, BOTH OF WHICH WILL WORK ON COUNSELING, </p><p>PUBLIC EDUCATION AND YOUTH AT RISK. </p><p> </p><p>3. USAID/CROATIA IS FUNDING TWO ANTI-TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, </p><p>ONE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC MIGRATION COMMISSION </p><p>(ICMC) IN COOPERATION WITH THE ROSA CENTER (A LOCAL NGO), </p><p>AND ONE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION </p><p>(IOM).  BOTH ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON RAISING AWARENESS AMONG THE </p><p>PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, THE LEGAL SECTOR AND POLICY MAKERS </p><p>THROUGH TARGETED CAMPAIGNS AND TRAINING.  IOM\'S AWARENESS </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS AIMED AT EDUCATING THE PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, NGO </p><p>COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS - TO UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>TRAFFICKED PERSONS ARE VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN </p><p>BEINGS CONSTITUTES A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p>TRAINING FOR JOURNALISTS THROUGH THE IOM\'S PROJECT WILL </p><p>ENSURE ACCURATE AND NON-BIASED REPORTING ON TIP ISSUES.  THE </p><p>OVERALL GOAL OF THE ICMC--ROSA CENTER ACTIVITY IS TO BUILD </p><p>CAPACITY OF LOCAL NGOS AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH </p><p>TRAININGS INCLUDING SUB-ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INFORMATION AND </p><p>AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS.  IN ADDITION THIS ACTIVITY WILL PUBLISH </p><p>A QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER.  RECENTLY, ICMC AND THE ROSA CENTER </p><p>ORGANIZED A SEMINAR FOR CROATIAN JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS FOR </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00213  301332Z </p><p>JUDICIAL ISSUES OF RECOGNIZING AND PROSECUTING TRAFFICKERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. USAID/CROATIA REVIEWS ALL DRAFT PUBLICATIONS AND MEDIA </p><p>PLANS IN BOTH TRAFFICKING AND HIV/AIDS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO </p><p>PUBLICATION AND BROADCAST TO ENSURE THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>U.S. LAWS AND ADMINISTRATION POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. USAID/CROATIA DOES NOT FULLY OR PARTIALLY FUND ANY </p><p>WEBSITE IN ITS GRANTS TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS OR TRAFFICKING. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR OWN WEBSITE AND THOSE OF THE </p><p>CURRENT IMPLEMENTERS AND CONFIRM THAT THE MATERIAL IS </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
