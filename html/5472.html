WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, TC, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF US EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Thomas Williams for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary:  Commercial Officer Mary O\'Brien received information </p><p>that U.S. company Criminal Research Products, Inc. has been willfully </p><p>evading US export regulations by exporting controlled items to Canada </p><p>for re-export to at least one destination where those items would </p><p>require a U.S. export license.  The New York Field Office of the Office </p><p>of Export Enforcement has an open investigation on Criminal Research </p><p>Products, Inc. and the case agent assigned is Tom Williams in NYFO. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C/NF)  On January 29, Comoff O\'Brien met with Mohammed-Hani C. Ali, </p><p>Sales and Marketing Manager, Giftex Corp., Abu Dhabi, UAE.  Mr. Ali had </p><p>contacted Comoff O\'Brien to report that a shipment of fingerprint items </p><p>he had ordered from Criminal Research Products, Inc. (CRP), 206-218 E. </p><p>Hector St., Conshohocken PA 19428, had been delayed.  He reported that </p><p>he had attempted on many occasions to contact Dick Richards of CRP to </p><p>ascertain why the shipment had been delayed and received only one </p><p>response from Mr. Richards on 12/10/02. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C/NF) Following is a report of Mr. Ali\'s comments and the facts as </p><p>revealed by documents in the files of Giftex. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C/NF)  Giftex has been purchasing products from CRP since at least </p><p>1997.  Mr. Ali reported that CRP had never requested that he complete a </p><p>end-user form for purchases from CRP.  Mr. Ali has completed such forms </p><p>for purchases from other companies in the U.S. and so was familiar with </p><p>the form.  He said Mr. Richards had always assured him it was not </p><p>necessary.  On 10/2/02, Giftex confirmed their order for $8,276.40 of </p><p>fingerprint equipment including 4 different kinds of fingerprint powder </p><p>and various lifters.  On 10/29/02, Giftex requested that CRP report the </p><p>status of this order.  On 11/4/02, Dick Richards replied that the order </p><p>could be supplied by December 10.  Beginning 11/16/02, Giftex sent </p><p>numerous emails requesting a copy of the air waybill for the shipment o </p><p>the items. </p><p> </p><p>6.(C/NF)  Giftex received no response until 12/10/02 when </p><p>Dick Richards sent an email reading in part as follows: </p><p>     "Reference is made to your various e-mails, faxes and </p><p>     telephone calls regarding your order. </p><p> </p><p>     Due to certain government regulations and restrictions </p><p>     we are having a difficult time in getting this order </p><p>     released for shipment. </p><p> </p><p>     When we first quoted to you we did not anticipate any </p><p>     restrictions or regulations would arise however it has, </p><p>     henceforth the reason for the delay. </p><p> </p><p>     We are diligently working on this problem and we hope </p><p>     to have it resolved soon." </p><p> </p><p>This information may indicate that CRP\'s shipment was </p><p>detained in the U.S. by U.S. Customs for lack of an export </p><p>license but post has been unable to confirm this. </p><p> </p><p>7.(C/NF)  Beginning 12/12/02, Giftex continued to press CRP by e-mail, </p><p>fax and phone calls for information about when the shipment would </p><p>arrive.  On or about 12/21/02, Giftex personnel had a telephone </p><p>conversation with Dick Richards of CRP. The content of this telephone </p><p>call was referred to in an email dated 12/21/02 from Dr. Fouad Aoudi of </p><p>Giftex which states: </p><p> </p><p>       "As we have no other choice but to wait.  And based on </p><p>       your confirmation and reconfirmation regarding </p><p>       the supply of products through our several correspondences </p><p>       we have confirmed to our client and gave him assurances </p><p>       to supply on date.  As we are under delayed penalty </p><p>       which is equal to 25 percent of the order value up to </p><p>       date.  Also I would like to remind you that you </p><p>       confirmed to us, there will be no problem to supply </p><p>       transpassing [sic] the authorities from your side by </p><p>       supplying from [sic] the goods from Canada." </p><p> </p><p>Since that telephone call, Giftex has received no/no </p><p>communication from CRP regarding this order. </p><p> </p><p>8.(C/NF)  While reviewing documents related to previous </p><p>orders, Comoff O\'Brien found an invoice dated 12/12/01 </p><p>issued by CRP to Giftex for 5 Deluxe LP [Latent Print] </p><p>Technician Kits #27-275, valued at $460 each in 3 cartons </p><p>weighing 129 pounds. Comoff requested to see the inbound </p><p>documents for this shipment.  Mr. Ali provided a copy of a </p><p>UPS waybill dated 12/19/01 from Invitro Sciences Inc., 166 </p><p>Bridlewood Dr, Welland, Ontario, Canada 030602.  The </p><p>description of goods states forensic fingerprint collection </p><p>kits and states the country of origin as the US.  The </p><p>sender\'s name is P. Couture and the phone number is 905-714- </p><p>7540.  The shipment consisted of 3 boxes weighing 129 </p><p>pounds. </p><p> </p><p>9.(C/NF)  The shipment was accompanied by an invoice </p><p>dated 12/19/01 issued by Invitro Sciences to Giftex for 5 </p><p>C27-275 Deluxe LP Fingerprint Kits at $460 each. The </p><p>invoice also indicates the shipment is in 3 cartons weighing </p><p>129 pounds and states the country of origin is the US. </p><p> </p><p>10.(C/NF)  Comoff O\'Brien also reviewed the Airport Import </p><p>Bill issued by UAE customs for clearance.  This document </p><p>dated 12/23/01 cleared 3 cartons of fingerprint kits valued </p><p>at $2300 addressed to Giftex. The Customs Bill showed the </p><p>country of origin as Canada. </p><p> </p><p>11.(C/NF)  Due to the sensitivity of the situation, Comoff </p><p>requested copies of documents for only the one shipment </p><p>transshipped through Canada, although there have obviously </p><p>been numerous shipments from CRP to Giftex since 1997. </p><p>Comoff suggests that CRP has been evading export license </p><p>requirements with some frequency. </p><p> </p><p>12.(C/NF)  Comoff O\'Brien also reviewed documents relative </p><p>to the export of a stream light to Giftex in 2002.  An email </p><p>from Dick Richards to Giftex states that the shipment could </p><p>be sent through (quote) our satellite office (unquote). </p><p>Based on the shipper\'s letter of instruction, this export </p><p>was exported under NLR.  It is unclear whether this item </p><p>would require an export license; therefore copies of these </p><p>documents were not taken. Copies of all other documents will </p><p>be forwarded under separate cover. </p><p> </p><p>13.(C/NF) Per a telephone conversation with NYFO, Comoff </p><p>O\'Brien confirmed that the New York Field Office of the </p><p>Office of Export Enforcement has an open investigation of </p><p>criminal research products.  NYFO has not however detained any </p><p>shipments by CRP. This information is provided to NYFO for necessary </p><p>action. </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
