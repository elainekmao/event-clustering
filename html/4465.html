<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe to Try Dual Interest Rates </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 2546 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The Reserve Bank announced it will allow the </p><p>market to determine lending rates for most businesses and </p><p>consumers while subsidizing an ultra-low rate for certain </p><p>exporters.  The welcome step toward interest rate </p><p>liberalization is unlikely to offset other </p><p>interventionist measures that punish exporters.  If the </p><p>market-determined rate applies to savings as well as </p><p>borrowing, it will provoke an investor exodus from </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s stock market.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Businesses must cope with rate hikes </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2. The GoZ said it would finance the ultra-low borrowing </p><p>rate of 15 percent (inflation is conservatively pegged at </p><p>144 percent) with a Z$ 25 billion (US$ 16 million) fund. </p><p>This is great news to anyone who can access the funds, </p><p>but the GoZ did not explain how it would prioritize </p><p>exporters.  The lucky few should be able to boost </p><p>productivity and earn the GoZ desperately-needed foreign </p><p>exchange.  Other businesses and consumers will watch </p><p>their variable interest rates float to more natural </p><p>levels, from approximately 60 to 160 percent. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. This would be a logical market solution to shore up </p><p>exports if the GoZ were not also tightening its grip on </p><p>most aspects of the economy.  Through the subsidy, the </p><p>GoZ will return to exporters as a whole only a small </p><p>portion of the 50-100 percent of foreign exchange </p><p>earnings it now retains (ref).  At the same time, many </p><p>borrowers will have to endure skyrocketing rates, causing </p><p>homeowners to default and businesses to raise prices </p><p>(tricky, given the GoZ\'s renewed vigor to control </p><p>prices). </p><p> </p><p>4. Finally, the GoZ did not address savings rates. We </p><p>assume they will also rise to levels that take inflation </p><p>into account, from perhaps 20-40 to 90-130 percent.  If </p><p>this happens, investors will transfer funds from stocks </p><p>to money-markets, causing a steep plunge in equities. </p><p>Many firms would thus be hit concurrently with </p><p>undercapitalization and higher borrowing rates. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
