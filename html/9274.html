<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PPD, ECA/PE, AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: JUDGE BUMIN\'S MAY VISIT TO US DEEMED A SUCCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3187 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons 1.5 b </p><p>and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish Constitutional Court Chairman </p><p>Mustafa Bumin called his May visit to the US "intensive </p><p>and valuable" and said he was exposed to US trial </p><p>alternatives and police practices that could be beneficial </p><p>for Turkey. Bumin also said he plans to follow through on </p><p>a recommendation to establish a Free Speech Committee. </p><p>One of the US-based organizers of Bumin\'s visit said the </p><p>justice appeared open minded, though defensive at times </p><p>about Turkey\'s image.  Embassy will continue to engage Bumin </p><p>on the issue of judicial reform. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Bumin traveled to the Washington, D.C., and San </p><p>Francisco areas May 17-24 under an individual program </p><p>sponsored and organized by the Embassy.  Bumin met with </p><p>officials from: the U.S. Supreme Court (including Chief </p><p>Justice Rehnquist); the California State Supreme Court; </p><p>district and superior courts; American University; the </p><p>Department of State; and the Department of Justice. In </p><p>addition, he participated in the Eleventh International </p><p>Judicial Conference in Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Justice Observes Mediation, Meets With Police </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Bumin told Ambassador June 5 that his US trip was </p><p>"intensive and valuable."  Bumin said he observed a </p><p>prosecutor and defense attorney conducting an arbitration, </p><p>the first time he had observed such a process.  He said he </p><p>also observed a two-hour mediation.  He noted that police </p><p>in Turkey are sometimes accused of serious mistreatment and </p><p>torture, particularly troubling given Turkey\'s EU candidacy. </p><p>He said police officials in the U.S. recommended to him ways </p><p>Turkish police could avoid such accusations.  Bumin said he </p><p>is enthusiastic about organizing a Committee on Freedom of </p><p>Thought and Expression in Turkey, as suggested to him by </p><p>Stephen Mayo, executive director of the Institute for the </p><p>Study and Development of Legal Systems (ISDLS), which </p><p>organized the California portion of Bumin\'s program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Impressed By US Trial Alternatives, </p><p>Defensive On Police Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Mayo told Embassy PA Counselor June 9 that Bumin </p><p>recognized the value of the US mediation process, calling </p><p>it "a better way of settling disputes," and saying Turkey </p><p>needed to adopt a similar practice.  Mayo said Bumin </p><p>recognized that such trial alternatives could have avoided </p><p>a recent ruling against Turkey by the European Court of </p><p>Human Rights for the excessive length of the Turkish trial </p><p>process.  Mayo said Bumin also showed interest in police </p><p>oversight groups in California.  However, he said Bumin </p><p>argued that the police-related reforms in Los Angeles were </p><p>fueled by citizen outrage and strong NGO/civil society </p><p>influence, and claimed it would be difficult to enact such </p><p>reforms in Turkey, where, he asserted, anti-police sentiment </p><p>is less intense.  Mayo said Bumin also made occasional </p><p>comments to the effect that American and French police are </p><p>more "abusive" than Turkish police, who have an "impeccable </p><p>record."  Mayo said these comments reflect the typically </p><p>defensive reaction of other Turkish participants in the </p><p>US-Turkey Judicial Exchange Program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Based on our interactions with Bumin, and the ISDLS </p><p>readout of his US visit, we hope Bumin can continue to play </p><p>a valuable role in our Judicial Exchange Program.  Bumin is </p><p>at times deaf to valid criticism of Turkey, and sometimes </p><p>clings to outmoded, Establishmentarian views about the need </p><p>to protect the State from the perceived threat of Islamic </p><p>"fundamentalism" and Kurdish cultural identity.  Still, he </p><p>appears more open to new ideas than most other high-level </p><p>Turkish justices.  This, combined with his stature as chief </p><p>of Turkey\'s highest court, makes him an important </p><p>interlocutor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
