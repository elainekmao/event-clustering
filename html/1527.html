REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE IS BEHIND OVERTURES MADE TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) IN LATE </p><p>JANUARY BY SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A SENIOR MDC ADVISOR.  THE SECRET CONTACTS ARE </p><p>CONTINUING BETWEEN ENVOYS FROM BOTH SIDES AND MIGHT LEAD TO </p><p>A MEETING BETWEEN MUGABE AND A SENIOR MDC REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>LATER THIS MONTH.  WE SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>INTENDS TO GIVE ANY REAL POWER TO THE MDC BUT, RATHER, HIS </p><p>OFFER OF A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IS CERTAINLY </p><p>DESIGNED TO COOPT HIS OPPOSITION.  MDC LEADER MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IS LIKELY ENGAGING IN THIS DIALOGUE IN AN EFFORT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TO AVOID FURTHER GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED BLOODSHED AND, WE </p><p>SUSPECT, IS ATTRACTED BY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIS PARTY TO </p><p>HAVE A VOICE IN DECIDING THE WAY FORWARD FOR ZIMBABWE. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WILL HAVE A VERY TOUGH -- IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE -- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TASK CONVINCING MANY IN HIS PARTY\'S OWN LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>VALUE OF JOINING HANDS WITH ZANU-PF, MANY OF WHOM BLAME </p><p>MUGABE PERSONALLY FOR ZIMBABWE\'S SLIDE INTO POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC TURMOIL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-MDC SECRET TALKS CONTINUE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE REPORTED REFTEL THAT SPEAKER OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00754  01 OF 02  151209Z </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA IN LATE JANUARY SENT FEELERS </p><p>TO THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), PROPOSING THAT </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY JOIN A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI CONSIDERED THE </p><p>DETAILS OF MNANGAGWA\'S INITIAL OFFER UNACCEPTABLE, HE </p><p>AGREED TO CONTINUE THE SECRET DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 14, MDC SENIOR ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY </p><p>(PROTECT) TOLD CHARGE AND POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF THAT </p><p>CONTACTS HAVE CONTINUED SINCE HIS FEBRUARY 2 CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH US (REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO PUZEY, IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HIMSELF IS BEHIND MNANGAGWA\'S OFFER. </p><p>PUZEY REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S LONG-TIME CONFIDANT, </p><p>CATHOLIC PRIEST FATHER FIDELIS MUKONORI, S.J., HAD RECENTLY </p><p>MET WITH PUZEY ONE-ON-ONE.  IN THAT MEETING, FIDELIS HAD </p><p>CLAIMED THAT MUGABE IS UNCERTAIN OF HIS CONTINUED HOLD ON </p><p>POWER, DISTRUSTS THOSE AROUND HIM, AND IS AWARE THAT, IF </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS HERE CONTINUE ON THEIR PRESENT COURSE, </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS FACING CERTAIN ECONOMIC DISASTER.  ALL OF THESE </p><p>FACTORS, FIDELIS OSTENSIBLY SAID, HAD LED MUGABE TO MAKE </p><p>THE OVERTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PUZEY REPORTED THAT TSVANGIRAI, WITH WHOM HE HAD </p><p>SPOKEN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, IS WILLING TO AGREE TO AN </p><p>AMNESTY FOR MUGABE AND THE PAYMENT OF A PENSION UPON THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DEPARTURE FROM OFFICE.  TSVANGIRAI REPORTEDLY </p><p>TOLD PUZEY THAT HE IS INCLINED TO JOIN A GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>NATIONAL UNITY IF IT RESULTS IN RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW AND BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON THE WAY FORWARD FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  IF THOSE IMPORTANT GOALS ARE ACHIEVED, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IS YOUNG AND WILLING TO WAIT ANOTHER FEW YEARS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00754  01 OF 02  151209Z </p><p>FOR HIS SHOT AT THE PRESIDENCY.  THE ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>REACHING SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT, PUZEY INSISTED, IS </p><p>BLOODSHED ON A SCALE NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN ZIMBABWE, AS </p><p>MUGABE WILL UNLEASH INDISCRIMINATE KILLING IN A BRUTAL </p><p>EFFORT TO MAINTAIN HIS GRIP ON POWER. </p><p> </p><p>CONTACTS VERY CLOSE-HOLD </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PUZEY SAID THAT ZANU-PF GO-BETWEEN GOODSON NGUNI </p><p>HAS ASKED HIM TO BRIEF THE BRITISH AND US ON THE STATUS OF </p><p>THESE TALKS, WHICH REMAINED VERY CLOSE-HOLD.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT, IN ADDITION TO HIMSELF, MUGABE, TSVANGIRAI, NGUNI, </p><p>AND FATHER FIDELIS, ONLY A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE AWARE </p><p>OF THE ONGOING CONTACTS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES: </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S ADVISOR GANDI MUDZINGWA, COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNION PRESIDENT TIM HENWOOD, AND STANBIC BANK MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR GREG BRACKENRIDGE. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) PUZEY SAID HE AND NGUNI HAD AGREED THAT MORNING </p><p>THAT A SENIOR MDC REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD MEET WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO AGREE ON NEXT STEPS.   PUZEY AND NGUNI DECIDED TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8700 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00754  02 OF 02  151209Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C60C2C  151209Z /38 </p><p>O 151209Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8229 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000754 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUGABE SAID TO BE BEHIND OVERTURE TO OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING ELABORATE SCENARIO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00754  02 OF 02  151209Z </p><p>WHICH PRESUMABLY PROVIDES COVER FOR A MUGABE MEETING WITH </p><p>THE MDC.  PAUL NYATHI, AN MDC MP WHO IS WELL-RESPECTED </p><p>ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WOULD BE ASKED TO PROPOSE ON </p><p>THE FLOOR OF PARLIAMENT THAT LEGISLATORS SING "HAPPY </p><p>BIRTHDAY" TO PRESIDENT MUGABE ON HIS BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY 21. </p><p>NYATHI WOULD FURTHER SUGGEST THAT A BIPARTISAN DELEGATION </p><p>OF MPS BE SENT TO DELIVER A BIRTHDAY CARD TO THE PRESIDENT. </p><p>ONCE AT STATE HOUSE, NYATHI WILL BE PULLED ASIDE BY FATHER </p><p>FIDELIS TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH MUGABE, WHO REPORTEDLY IS </p><p>PREPARED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A MEETING.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND NYATHI WOULD THEN DISCUSS THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR </p><p>PROCEEDING WITH FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, </p><p>INCLUDING AGREEING ON A VENUE OUTSIDE OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>TOUGH SELL </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE CHARGE COMMENTED THAT, IF NOT HANDLED </p><p>CAREFULLY, TSVANGIRAI\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH ZANU-PF COULD </p><p>TEAR APART THE MDC.  COULD TSVANGIRAI CONVINCE THE MDC </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND GENERAL MEMBERSHIP TO JOIN A GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>NATIONAL UNITY?  IT WOULD BE A TOUGH SELL, PUZEY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED.  HE THOUGHT THAT MDC MPS DAVID COLTART, MIKE </p><p>AURET, SR., AND TRUDY STEVENSON WOULD BE THE MOST DIFFICULT </p><p>TO CONVINCE.  IF THE TALKS ARE CONSTRUCTIVE AND RESULT IN A </p><p>MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT, THOUGH, PUZEY MUSED THAT </p><p>PAUL NYATHI COULD BE A KEY FIGURE IN BRINGING HIS FELLOW </p><p>MDC LEGISLATORS ALONG. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00754  02 OF 02  151209Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE ELABORATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A MUGABE-NYATHI </p><p>MEETING AT STATE HOUSE ARE UNDERSTANDABLE, AS WE SUSPECT </p><p>BOTH SIDES ARE NERVOUS ABOUT KEEPING THEIR DISCUSSIONS </p><p>SECRET.  A MORE DIFFICULT EXERCISE IS ANALYZING THE LIKELY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MOTIVATIONS OF MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI FOR ENGAGING IN THIS </p><p>DIALOGUE.  MUGABE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT HE IS UNLIKELY TO WIN </p><p>A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT IS FREE AND FAIR, BUT HE HAS </p><p>MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE IS WILLING TO USE ANY AND ALL </p><p>METHODS TO WIN.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT REALIZES </p><p>THAT SUCH A VICTORY WOULD COME AT A VERY HIGH PRICE IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND HE MUST FIGURE IT IS WORTH </p><p>EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF HOLDING ON TO POWER.  AS A </p><p>BRITISH DIPLOMAT REMARKED TO US, HOWEVER, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI </p><p>IS LIVING IN A FANTASYLAND IF HE THINKS THAT MUGABE, IN </p><p>EXTENDING THIS APPARENT OLIVE BRANCH, INTENDS TO REACH A </p><p>GENUINE POWER-SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE MDC.  WE WOULD </p><p>WAGER THAT MUGABE\'S OBJECTIVE IS TO COOPT HIS OPPOSITION </p><p>AND THAT, IF THE ATTEMPT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, HE WILL RESORT TO </p><p>HIS TIME-TESTED SUCCESSFUL TACTICS OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION.   NGUNI\'S PUTATIVE REQUEST THAT PUZEY BRIEF </p><p>US AND THE BRITISH IS INTERESTING, AND SUGGESTS THAT MUGABE </p><p>WANTS TO SEND US A SIGNAL THAT HE IS TRYING TO BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN AGREEING TO ENGAGE IN THIS DIALOGUE, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED PRIMARILY BY A DESIRE TO AVOID </p><p>BLOODSHED HE BELIEVES WOULD OTHERWISE BE INEVITABLE AND TO </p><p>ELICIT RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>OFFER OF 40 PERCENT OF CABINET SEATS MUST BE, ON THE </p><p>SURFACE, AN ATTRACTIVE OFFER FOR A PARTY THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00754  02 OF 02  151209Z </p><p>UNABLE TO RESPOND TO ITS CONSTITUENTS\' DEMANDS FOR CHANGE, </p><p>GIVEN ITS ABSENCE FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  SINCE MUGABE </p><p>HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT ALLOW THE MDC TO ASSUME </p><p>POWER EVEN IF IT WINS IN 2002, TSVANGIRAI MUST HAVE DECIDED </p><p>THAT IT IS AT LEAST WORTH SEEING WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO </p><p>OFFER.  THE MDC LEADER\'S INCLINATION TO PROCEED WITH SECRET </p><p>TALKS, HOWEVER, POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE COHESION OF </p><p>THE PARTY.  AS PUZEY INTIMATED, MANY IN THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND AMONG THE PARTY\'S SUPPORTERS BLAME MUGABE PERSONALLY </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE\'S DESCENT INTO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL </p><p>AND WOULD STRONGLY REJECT PARTICIPATION IN A GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>NATIONAL UNITY WITH A PRESIDENT THEY CONSIDER A WAR </p><p>CRIMINAL.  BESIDES, MANY ZIMBABWEANS BELIEVE IT IS ONLY A </p><p>MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THE MDC ASSUMES POWER AND THAT ALL </p><p>THEY NEED TO DO IS WAIT FOR THE MUGABE-LED ZANU TO IMPLODE. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, THEREFORE, MUST TREAD VERY CAREFULLY.   END </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
