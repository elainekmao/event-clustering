<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002245 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, SA/RA, DS/IP/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREL, PTER, KPAO, CASC, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. ARMS SALES TO NEPALI ARMY MAKES FRONT-PAGE </p><p>NEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2171 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Reports on U.S. sales of M-16 rifles to the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) appeared on the front pages of the November </p><p>23 editions of leading newspapers.  Disclosure of this </p><p>information, apparently leaked by the RNA itself, follows a </p><p>November 15 Maoist statement claiming responsibility for the </p><p>killings of two Embassy guards and warning that diplomatic </p><p>missions working against the Maoists "will not be spared by </p><p>our party."  Suggested press guidance follows in Para 4 </p><p>below.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On November 23, the Kathmandu Post, the </p><p>largest-circulation English daily, and its vernacular </p><p>counterpart, Kantipur, ran front-page reports on U.S. sales </p><p>of M-16 rifles to the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  The story, </p><p>quoting unidentified "RNA sources," reported RNA plans over </p><p>the next three years to provide every soldier with an M-16. </p><p>(Note:  A statement in the fourth paragraph of the story, </p><p>alleging that a first tranche of 5,000 of the weapons were </p><p>received in August, is incorrect.  No weapons have yet been </p><p>received by the RNA.  End note.)  The RNA decision to </p><p>purchase the rifles is explicitly linked to "escalating </p><p>Maoist violence." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  Until now, the Embassy has successfully </p><p>deflected specific queries from the public and the press </p><p>about details of our security assistance to the Government of </p><p>Nepal and the RNA.  It will be difficult for us to continue </p><p>to do so, at least with respect to our sales of M-16s. </p><p>Delivery of the first 1,500 may take place as early as </p><p>December, with the balance of the delivery in March.  The </p><p>story follows a November 15 press release from the Maoists </p><p>claiming responsibility for the slayings of two U.S. Embassy </p><p>guards (both Nepali) on December 15, 2001, and on November 9, </p><p>2002 (Reftel).  The press release sparked concern because of </p><p>its explicit warning that members of the U.S. and other </p><p>diplomatic missions "working against the Maoist party or . . </p><p>. to destroy the people\'s war . . . will not be spared by our </p><p>party. . . . We do not have the policy of fighting against </p><p>them unless they come to fight with us."  We suspect the </p><p>Maoists may well have known the rifles were coming, although </p><p>information about exact numbers and delivery dates may have </p><p>been sketchy.  Now that the story is out, we think it is </p><p>important that it be couched in a manner that the USG policy </p><p>decision to expand its military-to-military relationship with </p><p>Nepal be linked publicly to Maoist terror.  At the same time, </p><p>we plan to emphasize the unprecedented levels of our </p><p>development assistance and note that the arms sales in no way </p><p>undercut our previously stated support for a negotiated </p><p>resolution to the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Begin text of suggested, if-asked press guidance: </p><p> </p><p>IF ASKED ABOUT WEAPONS SALES: </p><p> </p><p>--The USG has agreed to sell M-16 rifles to the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army.  We have provided such rifles in the past for </p><p>international peacekeeping. </p><p> </p><p>--This agreement follows a USG policy decision to support the </p><p>Government of Nepal in its fight against Maoist terror and </p><p>violence against innocent civilians.  This violence has </p><p>obstructed international development programs--including </p><p>decades of US assistance--and severely undermined Nepal\'s </p><p>economic growth and social welfare. </p><p> </p><p>--Our security assistance to Nepal has expanded in direct </p><p>response to the unprecedented expansion of Maoist violence. </p><p> </p><p>--This assistance will include equipment, supplies, and </p><p>training, with particular emphasis on human rights training </p><p>for Royal Nepal Army soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>--We know that resolving the insurgency will require more </p><p>than security assistance.  Our government has increased </p><p>development assistance to Nepal to the unprecedented level of </p><p>almost USD 38 million--more than double the amount of our </p><p>security assistance. </p><p> </p><p>--More important than either security or development </p><p>assistance from foreign donors is commitment from the </p><p>government, the insurgents and the Nepali people to finding a </p><p>peaceful resolution to the conflict that upholds </p><p>constitutional multi-party democracy. </p><p> </p><p>--We call on the Maoists to cease their campaign of violence </p><p>and terror and accept the government\'s call for dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
