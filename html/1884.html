<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002072 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W (BOOTH), AF/RA (BITTRICK), AND PM FOR </p><p>(PETERS) </p><p>JCS FOR HEIMERLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, NI, MAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SECURITY ASSISTANCE MEETING CHAIRED BY </p><p>ACTING MINISTER OF DEFENSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: REF: ABUJA 2036 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: On August 13, Ambassador Jeter accompanied by </p><p>DATT, Acting ODC Chief and PolMilOff met with Acting Minister </p><p>of Defense Lawal Batagarawa and other Ministry officials to </p><p>discuss security assistance programs.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>explained that he had requested the meeting due to slow </p><p>progress on many assistance cases, including MOD failure to </p><p>sign a number of significant LOAs, and continuing problems </p><p>with IMET.  A lively and positive discussion followed, </p><p>facilitated by Minister Batagarawa, including an ODC briefing </p><p>on the role of ODC and the types of U.S. security assistance </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Batagarawa promised an improved relationship ("the </p><p>same as I did with OFR").  As a result of the meeting, the </p><p>participants agreed to have bi-weekly meetings between ODC </p><p>and the Ministry and Services.  Additionally, Batagarawa </p><p>asked for training on security assistance for the Ministry\'s </p><p>Legal Department and Joint Services Department.  The Ministry </p><p>agreed to give multiple names for all IMET slots in the </p><p>future.  Finally, the Minister instructed the head of the </p><p>Legal Department to inform the Nigerian DATT in Washington, </p><p>Group Captain Ode, to sign the Amended LOA for MPRI (although </p><p>it appears that additional intra-Ministry discussions will </p><p>occur before this instruction is carried out).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========== </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Numerous problems have plagued the security assistance </p><p>relationship between the U.S. and Nigeria since the inception </p><p>of democracy in May 1999.  Lack of Ministry action, largely </p><p>due to stovepipe communication channels within the Ministry </p><p>and between the Ministry and Services, as well as </p><p>bureaucratic infighting over resources, have delayed </p><p>completion of LOAs and caused the loss of badly needed and </p><p>highly desired IMET slots.  Moreover, the Nigerian DIA </p><p>insists that the DATT provide a notice of at least 30 days </p><p>before there is any contact between the DATT and GON </p><p>officials.  DIA has included ODC in this highly restrictive </p><p>requirement, which has made it nearly impossible for the many </p><p>TDY ODC staff members to establish and maintain productive </p><p>relationships.  (However, this has not prevented DIA from </p><p>returning ODC\'s letters seeking IMET course requests with </p><p>long lists filled only with intelligence courses.)  As a </p><p>result, Ambassador Jeter requested a meeting between the </p><p>Embassy (including himself, DATT, ODC and PolMilOff) and </p><p>policy-makers in the Ministry, including the Minister, the </p><p>Ministers of State for Army, Navy and Airforce, the Chief of </p><p>Defense Staff and the three Service Chiefs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ambassador Jeter was accompanied to the meeting by </p><p>DATT Nelson, Acting ODC Chief Kinser and PolMilOff.  The </p><p>meeting was chaired by the Acting Minister of Defense </p><p>(Minister of State for Army), Lawal Batagarawa.  Also in </p><p>attendance from the Ministry were the Permanent Secretary, </p><p>the heads of the Joint Services and Legal Departments and the </p><p>Directors of the Army, Navy and Air Force Departments.  The </p><p>Chief of Defense Staff, Vice Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi appeared </p><p>during the last few minutes of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>A NEW BEGINNING? </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter explained the reasons he had </p><p>requested the meeting, and emphasized the importance of </p><p>opening lines of communication on security assistance. </p><p>Delayed response to LOAs was holding back assistance that was </p><p>clearly needed and desired by the Ministry and Services. </p><p>Dropped IMET slots resulted in lost money and training to </p><p>Nigeria.  If the situation did not improve, it would be </p><p>difficult to convince Washington to maintain the current </p><p>level of security assistance to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Minister Batagarawa explained that while he was aware </p><p>that the Ambassador had requested a meeting with </p><p>policy-makers, he felt it was more important to begin with </p><p>the civil servants that dealt with these issues on a daily </p><p>basis.  Moreover, he noted, policy-makers can change, while </p><p>the MOD civil servants were less likely to be moved (and thus </p><p>could provide continuity in the security assistance </p><p>relationship).  A policy-maker level meeting could follow, if </p><p>desired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Major Kinser gave a security assistance briefing, and </p><p>a lively discussion of the legalese of LOAs, including the </p><p>MPRI amended LOA ensued.  The Head of the Legal Department </p><p>complained that the Embassy expected that the Ministry\'s </p><p>signature on LOAs was the perceived final step, whereas the </p><p>Nigerians were used to a three stage process, including a </p><p>letter of offer, a letter of acceptance and, after </p><p>negotiation, the signature of an agreement.  She bemoaned </p><p>many of the legal details in U.S. LOAs, including the 2.5 </p><p>percent fee and responsibility to pay any additional costs. </p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the Minister suddenly interrupted his </p><p>Head of Legal Department\'s questioning, and accurately </p><p>explained the difference between direct commercial sales, FMS </p><p>cases, and FMS grant assistance.  He emphasized the </p><p>advantages of working through the USG to procure equipment, </p><p>but noted it was discretionary.  However, with FMS cases </p><p>where the USG grants were provided, the Ministry would be </p><p>mistaken not to take full advantage of the goodwill.  Major </p><p>Kinser explained the difficulties the Embassy had had with </p><p>IMET.  The Head of the Joint Services gave her commitment </p><p>that from now on the Ministry would supply multiple names for </p><p>each training slot, and do so in a timely manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that the MPRI amended LOA had </p><p>yet to be signed by the GON.  This meant that the U.S. could </p><p>not access the money that Nigeria had transferred.  He also </p><p>noted that due to payment delays and exchange-rate </p><p>fluctuations, the final sum had come up short by about USD </p><p>400,000.  Batagarawa asked his Head of the Legal Department </p><p>if that were true.  She explained that it was, that she had </p><p>concerns about the LOA language that she had raised with </p><p>Minister Danjuma, and that she had sent a letter to the </p><p>Nigerian DATT in Washington, Group Captain Ode, to send a </p><p>letter giving the USG access to the money, rather than </p><p>signing the LOA.  Batagarawa directed that now that she had </p><p>clarification on the LOA process, she should immediately </p><p>write to Ode to sign the LOA.  She complained that she had </p><p>planned to meet with other department heads to discuss the </p><p>case, and wanted to do so before carrying out Batagarawa\'s </p><p>instruction.  He agreed, but told her to meet "quickly," and </p><p>bring him a recommendation by Thursday, August 16. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DATT suggested a bi-weekly meeting between ODC and the </p><p>Ministry to discuss cases and IMET slots, and to avoid any </p><p>future misunderstandings.  DATT, however, explained that this </p><p>might be a problem due to DIA\'s requirements for the DOD </p><p>personnel at the Embassy.  However, DIA could certainly </p><p>attend the regularly scheduled meetings.  The Minister </p><p>heartily agreed to the bi-weekly meetings (as did the MOD </p><p>staff in attendance).  He waved off DIA as a problem, but </p><p>agreed that including DIA was acceptable.  He also stated </p><p>that representatives of the CDS and the Service Chiefs should </p><p>also attend.  The situation would improve, the Minister said. </p><p> I give my personal commitment, "the same as I did with OFR." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Minister then told the DATT that he wanted </p><p>security assistance training for MOD civil servants, </p><p>especially the Legal and Joint Services Department.  He </p><p>explained that fewer problems would occur if there were a </p><p>better understanding in the Ministry of the U.S. process. </p><p>Colonel Nelson agreed to work on a security assistance </p><p>training plan that would involve bringing a small team to </p><p>Abuja to carry out the training for the Ministry.  Smiling, </p><p>the Minister asked, "Colonel Nelson, do I have your word on </p><p>that?" and jocularly turned to the Ambassador, and said, "I </p><p>am going to hold you responsible for his commitment."  (NOTE: </p><p>A slot was found for MOD personnel in October by the ODC. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>COMMENT AND ANALYSIS </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Due to the suspension of security assistance during </p><p>the Abacha regime, the Embassy and the Ministry of Defense </p><p>are in some ways creating a new relationship. </p><p>Understandably, any new relationship has problems.  While the </p><p>Embassy has worked for the past two years to reform and </p><p>rebuild the security assistance relationship with Nigeria, </p><p>the Ministry of Defense is in many ways just now finding its </p><p>feet, and expanding its role in overseeing the Services.  A </p><p>renewed effort to establish open and transparent channels of </p><p>communication between the Embassy and the Ministry, is an </p><p>important step.  The recent meeting was extremely helpful in </p><p>this regard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) For those that would engage in corrupt practices, </p><p>working with the USG presents serious problems.  Because our </p><p>programs are so well defined and carefully managed, there is </p><p>little room for kickbacks.  Therefore, the purchase of </p><p>military goods from others, such as Russia or China, holds a </p><p>much greater attraction for those MOD rent seekers.  While </p><p>corruption of this sort will not go away any time soon, </p><p>improved communication and cooperation will make it more </p><p>difficult for those who would restrict and then criticize the </p><p>relationship with the U.S. for their own ends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Minister Batagarawa has consistently met his </p><p>commitments to the Embassy, and has served effectively as a </p><p>problem-solver for the bilateral relationship.  His decision </p><p>to involve the Ministry\'s civil servants was well-considered. </p><p> We are also confident that he will do everything he can to </p><p>meet his commitment to us for improved coordination on FMS </p><p>cases and IMET. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) DAO COMMENT:  A security-related follow-on meeting </p><p>between ODC and MOD, Service and DIA staff was held on August </p><p>14.  The meeting established the bi-weekly schedule.  At the </p><p>meeting, MOD Joint Services and Legal Departments stated that </p><p>unless the U.S. makes the voluminous legal changes to the </p><p>LOAs currently awaiting signature, they would not be signed. </p><p>ODC explained that it was very unlikely that any substantive </p><p>changes would be made but that our legal experts would review </p><p>the Nigerian requests.  DAO pointed out that this would mean, </p><p>at best, further delays and at worst, the complete cessation </p><p>of the FMF program for Nigeria.  DATT believes that when this </p><p>development is revealed to Batagarawa, the MOD Legal and </p><p>Joint Staff representatives will be told to cooperate.  END </p><p>DAO COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) This cable was cleared with DAO and ODC. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
