<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 26: U.S. AID PROPOSAL SPARKS </p><p>LIMITED RALLY; IMF REPORTS PROGRESS ON FOURTH REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Markets rallied March 26 am with T-bill </p><p>yields dropping six percentage points, on news of the U.S. </p><p>war supplemental for Turkey.  But market sentiment remains </p><p>pessimistic about upcoming debt roll-overs, and the GOT\'s </p><p>credibility with the markets remains rock bottom.  IMF resrep </p><p>reports overnight progress towards finalizing the LOI, which </p><p>now could be signed by mid-next week.  State Planning Chief </p><p>told us the GOT is serious about moving forward quickly on </p><p>reforms to help restore market confidence.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Improve, But Foreigners </p><p>Stay Out for Now </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkish markets rallied on March 26 am, on further </p><p>news that the USG\'s supplemental budget request to Congress </p><p>includes a $1 billion grant to Turkey, potentially </p><p>convertible into as much as $8.5 billion in loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Lira-denominated T-bill yields dropped to 64 percent </p><p>compounded (yesterday\'s close was 70 percent.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira appreciated nearly 3 percent, trading at TL </p><p>1,690,000 to the dollar at mid-day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index closed up 3.4 </p><p>percent in light trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Foreign investors are staying out of Turkish </p><p>markets for now, per local brokers and bond traders.  Some </p><p>market analysts (Bender Securities Golkan, Eurosource\'s Ucer) </p><p>believe Turkish banks are driving down T-bill yields partly </p><p>for end of quarter "window dressing" purposes, i.e., making </p><p>the asset side of their balance sheets (stuffed with T-bills) </p><p>look temporarily better as of Monday March 31.  We agree that </p><p>in general markets remain unhappy with the GOT, and there is </p><p>ongoing concern with the GOT\'s ability to comfortably </p><p>roll-over debt in advance of large debt redemption dates </p><p>(April 9, May 21, June 4 and June 18).  We note the managers </p><p>of the top four Turkish banks are in Ankara in talks with </p><p>MinState Babacan to express their concerns.  State Bank Board </p><p>Chairman Ocak told Econ Counselor March 26 that "Istanbul </p><p>remains furious with the GOT;" he believes immediate credible </p><p>steps are needed to repair market sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  Nevertheless, with yesterday\'s </p><p>announcement on the war supplemental, analysts here see the </p><p>possibility of a good scenario based on two elements: the GOT </p><p>repairing relations with IMF, finishing the Fourth Review and </p><p>continuing to implement reforms; the reduced but still </p><p>existing perception that the USG won\'t let Turkey\'s economy </p><p>meltdown during the Iraq war. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Progress on the IMF Fourth Review </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) IMF resrep briefed us this morning on the results </p><p>of his March 25 evening meeting with Turkish Treasury U/S </p><p>Oztrak.  Resrep said if the progress continued, he could </p><p>foresee signing the LOI as early as mid-next week, with a </p><p>possible Board date as early as mid-April. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Timing.  Oztrak was pushing for signing the LOI this </p><p>Friday, and  IMF staff seeking a Board date before the $3 </p><p>billion debt redemption on April 9.  Resrep said this was </p><p>over-optimistic.  If progress continued, the IMF could issue </p><p>a positive statement on the Fourth Review in advance of the </p><p>April 9 redemption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Macro-Economic Targets.  Treasury asked the IMF to delay </p><p>revising the program\'s macro framework until the Fifth </p><p>Review, in order to expedite consideration of the Fourth </p><p>Review.  IMF staff was weighing this request.  Current </p><p>volatilities (market roller coaster, uncertain growth </p><p>projections, possible need to revise inflation targets) all </p><p>argued in favor of postponing until the Fifth Review, he </p><p>noted. But he wouldn\'t second guess the decision of IMF </p><p>headquarters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Issues for Signing the LOI.  If the IMF agrees to </p><p>postpone revision of the macro-economic framework, there are </p><p>still at least two policy issues left to be resolved before </p><p>the LOI can be signed, per Resrep.  First, the GOT must </p><p>identify the sources for the TL 4 quadrillion in spending </p><p>delays announced on March 24.  Oztrak said the plan is to </p><p>pass the budget as planned on March 28, and then within five </p><p>days thereafter to issue a circular to all ministries </p><p>indicating which expenditures must be delayed.  For LOI </p><p>purposes, however, these additional 2003 spending delays or </p><p>blocks must be reflected in the central government primary </p><p>balances annex (there is a bimonthly performance criterion </p><p>for this balance), and the IMF won\'t agree to delay this </p><p>until the Fifth Review.  Second, the GOT has not yet canceled </p><p>the pending investigations into the BRSA over the June 2002 </p><p>intervention of Pamukbank. </p><p>--  Prior Actions for Finishing the Fourth Review.  Resrep </p><p>reported progress also on the four key prior actions.  First, </p><p>the parliament would vote on the 2003 budget on March 28. </p><p>Second, IMF staff have approved the draft Direct Tax Reform </p><p>bill, which is slated to be submitted to the parliament\'s </p><p>budget and planning commission on March 27 (the prior action </p><p>is passage through this commission).  Third, the GOT is </p><p>preparing two regulatory measures to address over-staffing in </p><p>state enterprises (a Cabinet decree to cancel earlier decrees </p><p>that prevent forcible retirements; a new schedule and </p><p>strategy for eliminating redundant positions by year-end). </p><p>Fourth, the TEKEL privatization plan faces one last obstacle: </p><p> the Competition Board currently wants to break up the </p><p>tobacco and spirits units into smaller pieces,  while the </p><p>privatization plan is to sell them as entire units to </p><p>maximize buyer interest and GOT revenue from the sale.  The </p><p>World Bank is advising to proceed with the existing plan, and </p><p>amend it later if the Competition Board\'s final ruling </p><p>requires splitting up the privatization tenders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Planning Chief Asserts GOT is Serious </p><p>About Reforms </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In a March 26 meeting with Econ Counselor, State </p><p>Planning U/S Ahmet Tiktik said the government understood the </p><p>need to take significant steps to bolster market confidence, </p><p>and was beginning to take those steps.  Most important, per </p><p>Tiktik, the government would implement the March 24 </p><p>announcement on TL 4 quadrillion of spending delays by </p><p>freezing non-compulsory spending, including public </p><p>investments and certain transfers.  He described this as a </p><p>temporary, emergency measure to build up Treasury\'s cash </p><p>reserves.  Tiktik said the government would also try to </p><p>accelerate structural reforms, including privatization.   We </p><p>noted the precariousness of Turkey\'s financial situation and </p><p>the lack of confidence among investors, and stressed the need </p><p>for bold action -- not just rhetoric -- in the coming days. </p><p>We also suggested that the government consider steps outside </p><p>of the IMF program -- such as accelerating telecom </p><p>liberalization -- to demonstrate to investors that it has a </p><p>long-term plan to promote growth and competitiveness, in </p><p>addition to a short-term plan to avoid financial collapse. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
