<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  07-23-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, CE, NO, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  In meeting, radical JVP party leader flays </p><p>peace process, supports pact with president\'s party </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 1275; (B) 01 Colombo 1564 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a July 23 meeting, Tilvin Silva, </p><p>leader of the radical JVP party, asserted that the GSL\'s </p><p>recent proposal on forming an interim structure in the </p><p>north/east would give the Tigers too much power.  He </p><p>also claimed that the Norwegian facilitators were biased </p><p>toward the Tigers.  The JVP remained committed to </p><p>forming an alliance with the president\'s party.  Based </p><p>on Silva\'s comments, the JVP has not climbed down a wit </p><p>from its long-standing anti-peace process views.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MEETING WITH RADICAL PARTY LEADER:  Polchief and </p><p>poloff met July 23 with Tilvin Silva, the General </p><p>Secretary of the Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>("People\'s Liberation Front").  The meeting took place </p><p>at the JVP\'s headquarters in a large house in a non- </p><p>descript Colombo suburb.  Fitting with its radical </p><p>image, the party\'s offices were modestly furnished (no </p><p>bourgeois elements here!) and festooned with large </p><p>pictures of "revolutionary" heroes, including Marx, </p><p>Lenin, and Guevara.  There was also a large picture of </p><p>Rohana Wijeweera, the JVP\'s founder, looking more than a </p><p>bit like Che thanks to a beard and beret with a red star </p><p>on it.  (Note:  Wijeweera, who led failed insurrections </p><p>against the government in the 1970\'s and 1980\'s, was </p><p>slain by security forces in November 1989.  Through the </p><p>1990\'s, the JVP, which now professes a commitment to </p><p>democracy, has steadily gained in elections and now </p><p>holds 16 seats in Parliament.  End Note.)  While he </p><p>clearly understands some English, Silva spoke in Sinhala </p><p>throughout the meeting.  (Note:  The JVP is an </p><p>overwhelmingly Sinhalese party and its officials make a </p><p>conscious choice to speak Sinhala, the "mother tongue.") </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) HITTING OUT AT THE PEACE PROCESS:  Silva used </p><p>much of the meeting to flay the government\'s effort to </p><p>achieve a negotiated settlement with the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  While sticking to his </p><p>typically low-key style, Silva exuded a strong sense of </p><p>purpose in the process, indicating no lessening in the </p><p>JVP\'s long-standing hard-line stance against the peace </p><p>track.  (Note:  For bio-data on Silva, who served time </p><p>in prison during the 1988-89 JVP uprising -- see Ref B.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Silva, specifically, criticized the GSL\'s recent </p><p>proposal setting out modalities on forming an interim </p><p>structure in the north/east.  (Note:  Per Ref A, the </p><p>Norwegian government facilitators provided the proposal </p><p>to the LTTE last week and the Tigers continue to review </p><p>it.)  Silva claimed that the proposal provides the </p><p>Tigers too much power in running the north/east.  In </p><p>addition, the proposal did not provide enough </p><p>protections to minority communities, such as the Muslims </p><p>and the Sinhalese.  While underscoring his party\'s </p><p>support for an end to the war, Silva said peace could </p><p>only come about through the disarmament of the LTTE, </p><p>which had created an "illegal" military force.  In </p><p>response, polchief underscored U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process, urging the JVP to work with the </p><p>government on this key issue of national importance. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NORWEGIANS COME IN FOR SOME FLAK:  Regarding </p><p>Norway\'s role, Silva had no/no words of support.  The </p><p>JVP, he said, believed that the Norwegians were no </p><p>longer acting as a "facilitator," but were increasingly </p><p>acting as a "mediator," recommending items to the </p><p>parties and, thus, trying to "direct" their course of </p><p>action.  This was unacceptable to an independent </p><p>country.  Moreover, the Norwegian government and the </p><p>Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) had </p><p>generally shown themselves to be pro-LTTE.  As an </p><p>example of this, he said the SLMM should not have </p><p>recommended that the government recognize the legitimacy </p><p>of the "Sea Tigers," the LTTE\'s naval force. </p><p>(Note:  Silva got this wrong:  the SLMM, reacting to </p><p>several violent confrontations at sea, had earlier this </p><p>year offered to work with the GSL and the Tigers on ways </p><p>to avoid incidents.  The SLMM never said the government </p><p>should "recognize" the Sea Tigers, however.)  Polchief </p><p>remarked that the JVP should reconsider its view of the </p><p>GoN effort; the Norwegians really wanted what was best </p><p>for Sri Lanka and were in no way biased toward the </p><p>Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) JVP STILL WANTS AN ALLIANCE:  When queried, </p><p>Silva replied that the JVP still wanted to ally itself </p><p>with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the key </p><p>constituent element in President Kumaratunga\'s People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA).  Shooting down reports to the contrary, </p><p>Silva said there had been no delay in forming the </p><p>alliance:  the two parties were still negotiating a </p><p>joint framework, which should be completed soon.  The </p><p>major factor propelling the JVP\'s desire to form the </p><p>alliance, he continued, was the need to bring down the </p><p>United National Party (UNP) government, which was </p><p>"ruining" the country.  If a SLFP-JVP alliance was </p><p>reached and took power, the JVP would seriously consider </p><p>assuming ministerial positions.  (Note:  This view re </p><p>ministries is new.  The PA and the JVP formed a pact in </p><p>late 2001 in which the JVP backed the faltering PA </p><p>government in Parliament.  The JVP refused to assume </p><p>ministerial positions at that time.  The pact later </p><p>lapsed.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Based on Silva\'s comments, the JVP has </p><p>not climbed down a wit from its long-standing anti-peace </p><p>process views.  It is hard to assess how dangerous the </p><p>party is to the peace track.  If the JVP does link up </p><p>with President Kumaratunga and her party, it may have a </p><p>shot at being in the next government, which would be a </p><p>serious blow to the peace process.  As an independent </p><p>force, however, the party is a bit marginal:  it can </p><p>stir up demonstrations, etc., but otherwise has little </p><p>leverage.  Some observers say, however, that the party </p><p>may be gaining strength in the rural Sinhalese heartland </p><p>and be on its way to becoming even more of an electoral </p><p>force than it already is.  (Note:  In the last election </p><p>in December 2001, the JVP won almost 10 percent of the </p><p>vote, an impressive total for a hard-line left wing </p><p>party in Sri Lanka.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimized considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
