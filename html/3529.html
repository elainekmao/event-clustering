<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ASEC, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: MASS ARRESTS OF ZIMBABWEAN FARMERS WHO IGNORE </p><p>EVICTION DEADLINE, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Police have begun arresting commercial farmers -- and </p><p>family members, in some cases -- who have failed to comply </p><p>with the August 8 deadline to leave their properties.  More </p><p>than 140 people were arrested over the August 17-18 weekend, </p><p>and 92 remained incarcerated on the morning of August 19. </p><p>Orders clearly have been issued from on high to incarcerate </p><p>farmers who have chosen to remain on their properties, </p><p>instead of charging and releasing them, and arrests seem to </p><p>be taking place throughout the country.  Some of those in </p><p>detention have been subjected to humiliating treatment and </p><p>are hoping that the courts rule favorably on their bail </p><p>applications early in the week of August 19.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) According to the splinter group Justice for </p><p>Agriculture (JAG), whose mandate is to publicize developments </p><p>in the long-standing land acquisition exercise, the majority </p><p>of arrests have occurred in Mashonaland East, Mashonaland </p><p>Central, Mashonaland West, and Masvingo, with other </p><p>detentions scattered throughout the remaining farming </p><p>regions.  The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) has encouraged </p><p>farmers to present a signed statement to the police who </p><p>arrest them, containing a list of reasons why the August 8 </p><p>deadline does not apply to them, including:  the lack of an </p><p>Administrative Court ruling on the acquisition, objections to </p><p>the validity of section 8 orders, and objections to </p><p>abandoning crops in the field and livestock.  We understand </p><p>that police have refused to accept such statements, noting </p><p>simply that they have orders from above to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>Snapshot from a troubled region </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As an illustrative example, Alan Parsons (strictly </p><p>protect) is a leader in the farming community in Karoi, a </p><p>town 200 km northwest of Harare which has been particularly </p><p>affected by land invasions since 2000.  Parsons told us that </p><p>arrests in the Karoi area began in earnest on August 16, but </p><p>farmers at that point were released after being charged with </p><p>remaining on their properties after the August 8 deadline and </p><p>signing "warned and cautioned" statements.  The district </p><p>police commissioner began going farm-to-farm in a </p><p>four-vehicle convoy, accompanied by war veterans, the </p><p>district administrator (the central government\'s top local </p><p>authority), and riot police.   On August 18, however, the </p><p>police changed their approach and began jailing those found </p><p>on designated properties, including a farmer\'s spouse in at </p><p>least one case.  The district police commissioner told </p><p>Parsons he had come under strong pressure from his </p><p>"superiors" to incarcerate farmers who had received </p><p>acquisition notices.   On August 16, Parsons was at the Karoi </p><p>police station trying to offer assistance to affected farmers </p><p>and witnessed 15 separate police details being issued </p><p>weapons, including automatic weapons. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Parsons, who has received four preliminary </p><p>acquisition notices but not a final Section 8 notice, told us </p><p>about the particularly egregious case of the August 18 arrest </p><p>of Louise Cochran, a farmer\'s spouse.  When police failed to </p><p>find her husband at home, Cochran was taken to jail, and </p><p>forced to leave her six-year-old and three-year-old children </p><p>at the homestead with a housekeeper.  When the husband later </p><p>offered to replace his wife in jail, the police denied his </p><p>request.  To add insult to injury, police did not allow </p><p>delivery of basic personal items to Mrs. Cochran, including a </p><p>toothbrush, soap, facecloth, and drinking water.  The </p><p>officer-in-charge said Mrs. Cochran would have to share a </p><p>single mug and bucket of (presumably untreated) drinking </p><p>water with six other inmates.  The unfortunate irony in this </p><p>case is that the Cochrans do not own the property on which </p><p>they live; they lease it.  In a separate case which reveals </p><p>the chaotic and nonsensical way in which this effort is being </p><p>conducted, the manager of a farm which has already been ceded </p><p>to the GOZ was arrested and incarcerated as he was </p><p>supervising the winding down of activities on the property. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Parson expressed concern that "things might get nasty" </p><p>as a result of the government\'s latest initiative.  He has </p><p>heard some desperate farmers threatening to use personal </p><p>weapons both to spring their colleagues from jail and to </p><p>defend their homesteads. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Meanwhile, another of the farmers caught up in the </p><p>latest police sweep is Guy Coke-Norris, arrested in the </p><p>eastern city of Mutare on August 16.  Coke-Norris is in his </p><p>late 60\'s and suffers from a heart ailment, but he has been </p><p>denied access to his medication and medical care.  He has </p><p>been told he will be allowed only one visitor a week, and his </p><p>initial court hearing has been scheduled for August 22. </p><p>Other farming contacts have related similar tales, including </p><p>the inexplicable tracking down and beating of a farmer in the </p><p>Chisipite suburb of Harare, although the farmer had </p><p>reportedly abandoned his rural farm several months ago.  He </p><p>suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries, but to </p><p>date no one has been able to explain the exact genesis of the </p><p>assault. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) The final bell appears to be tolling for Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>white commercial farmers.   The GOZ seems determined to force </p><p>the vast majority of white farmers off their properties, </p><p>while intimidating and humiliating them, the consequences be </p><p>damned.  The farmers will undoubtedly seek protection in the </p><p>courts, but President Mugabe has already stated he will </p><p>ignore court rulings with which he does not agree.  The </p><p>government appears determined to jail holdout farmers while </p><p>six million Zimbabweans require food assistance, an image </p><p>that is both tragic and surreal.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
