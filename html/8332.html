<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0146 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 28, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 28, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal: An investigation was begun against </p><p>Enis Alkan, a senior student at Ataturk </p><p>University in Erzurum, because officials believe </p><p>Alkan made a pro-Kurdish statement with his </p><p>signature while filing a petition with the </p><p>university for mid-term exams. The report from </p><p>the security directorate stated, "although the </p><p>meaning of the signature is not being examined in </p><p>our laboratory, the signature resembles the word </p><p>Kurtculuk (Kurdism)." Alkan was dismissed from </p><p>the university. Alkan\'s request for suspension of </p><p>the act by the university was denied at the local </p><p>administrative court on the grounds that there </p><p>was no serious opposition to the law or </p><p>irrecoverable losses. Alkan is waiting for the </p><p>result of the appeal he made to the Regional </p><p>Administrative Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Radikal: In Kazanci village of Diyarbakir, </p><p>the elementary school teacher required a sick </p><p>student to read an anthem that begins with "happy </p><p>is he who says I am a Turk."  Because the student </p><p>chanted it silently, the teacher misunderstood </p><p>the student, and thought he said "happy is he who </p><p>says I am a Kurd;" and charges were brought </p><p>against the student at the State Security Court. </p><p>The unidentified student, who was tried at </p><p>Diyarbakir State Security Court, was acquitted on </p><p>the grounds that moral components of the crime </p><p>were not constituted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Radikal: Police in Hakkari used an </p><p>interesting method to determine people who </p><p>shouted pro-Ocalan and PKK/KADEK organization </p><p>slogans during the Newruz festivities in Hakkari </p><p>on March 21. Thirteen persons viewed with open </p><p>mouths in pictures taken by police were </p><p>interrogated for having shouted pro-separatist </p><p>organization slogans. The police filed a petition </p><p>with the office of the Chief Public Prosecutor of </p><p>Hakkari against the suspects for "supporting and </p><p>harboring the organization," and demanded a </p><p>warrant of arrest in absentia be issued for eight </p><p>suspects not found at their addresses. Five other </p><p>suspects were arraigned. Later the court released </p><p>the suspects because of lack of solid evidence. </p><p>The suspects\' attorney, Mikhail Demiroglu, said </p><p>the police did not have sound records of the </p><p>people accused, and it was difficult to </p><p>understand what was said and by whom at a place </p><p>where thirty thousand people had gathered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: A court in Tunceli gave a one month </p><p>imprisonment sentence to 30 persons, including </p><p>HADEP\'s former Provincial Chairman Alcan Onlu, </p><p>and the former Provincial Chairman of EMEP, Salih </p><p>Gundogan, for attending the May 1 Labor Day </p><p>Meeting in Tunceli. Regarding the issue, an </p><p>attorney from Tunceli Bar Association, Baris </p><p>Yildirim, said, although the OHAL (State of </p><p>Emergency Rule) has been lifted, its effects </p><p>still continue. Yildirim said the people had </p><p>gathered to celebrate Labor Day, and making a </p><p>press release was not a crime by law. Yildirim </p><p>said they would appeal the court\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milli Gazete/Bolge: Adana Governor Kemal Onal </p><p>said there was a pressing need in Adana for five </p><p>thousand classrooms in elementary schools and 925 </p><p>classrooms in secondary schools. Governor Onal </p><p>said because Adana received influxes of </p><p>immigrants, the need for classrooms increased. </p><p>The Governor also stated 300 teachers, appointed </p><p>to Adana for health and family reasons, were </p><p>receiving their salaries without teaching any </p><p>classes. Onal claimed that most of the immigrants </p><p>had multiple children and the need for classrooms </p><p>was mainly felt in Yuregir and Seyhan districts </p><p>of the town. Governor Onal said he was expecting </p><p>support from private citizens and companies to </p><p>resolve the issue. He added they spent </p><p>approximately 2.750 million USD for </p><p>transportation of 13,500 students throughout the </p><p>province. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Hurriyet: Three hundred physicians and nurses </p><p>from various towns were trained on "Family </p><p>Planning Standardization Education" at the </p><p>Yavuzlar Infirmary in Adana. Adana Provincial </p><p>Health Director, Dr. Serdar Mercan, stated their </p><p>objective is to give standard, good quality </p><p>family planning service in all Health Ministry- </p><p>affiliated institutions. Mercan said a team </p><p>consisting of 15 persons started the education </p><p>program in Adana in 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Bolge: The President of Chamber of Commerce </p><p>in Adana, Saban Bas, said they would open an </p><p>International Fair in September in Adana. He </p><p>stated this fair would be vitally important for </p><p>promoting the trade in the Southern and </p><p>Southeastern regions. Bas said the fair would be </p><p>set up on 50 acres of land with 11 thousand </p><p>square meters of covered area for tents. Bas said </p><p>permanent buildings for the fair would be built </p><p>in coming years. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
