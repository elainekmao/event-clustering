THE GERMAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT (BMZ) HAS PROPOSED AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF </p><p>WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO. DR. HORST BREIR (HEAD OF </p><p>EVALUATION, BMZ) ADDRESSED AN INFORMAL DONOR SESSION OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05511  131052Z </p><p>THIRD REGULAR SESSION OF WFP\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD ON OCTOBER </p><p>23, AND PRESENTED A DRAFT TOR NON-PAPER.

A QUALIFIED CONTRACTING FIRM WOULD BE </p><p>SELECTED THROUGH AN INTERNATIONAL TENDERING PROCESS. DENMARK </p><p>AND THE NETHERLANDS AFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS </p><p>UNDERTAKING. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE STUDY WOULD BE A FOLLOW ON TO A TRIPARTITE EVALUATION </p><p>OF WFP, CONDUCTED BY CANADA, THE NETHERLANDS AND NORWAY OVER </p><p>THE PERIOD 1991-94. IT WOULD SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE </p><p>PRESENT STATUS OF WFP\'S FOOD AID AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY, AS </p><p>ADOPTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD IN MAY 1999; THE LEVEL OF </p><p>FUNDING, TRENDS AND SCOPE OF WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO; </p><p>AND THE ABILITY OF WFP TO MEET ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS WITH </p><p>REGARD TO TARGETING, PARTICIPATION, RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT </p><p>AND PROGRAM IMPACT. THE EVALUATION WILL PRINCIPALLY FOCUS ON </p><p>LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WFP\'S 1999 </p><p>POLICY, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT CONTEXTS IN </p><p>WHICH FOOD AID MAKES SENSE AND POSSIBLE NEED FOR GREATER WFP </p><p>FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION OF ITS DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. BMZ PROPOSES A YEAR-AND-A-HALF TIME FRAME (JANUARY 2003- </p><p>JUNE 2004). A RESTRICTED STEERING COMMITTEE OF DONOR </p><p>EVALUATION EXPERTS (INCLUDING A WFP EVALUATION MEMBER) WOULD </p><p>BE ESTABLISHED (TOTAL 5-6 PERSONS) TO GUIDE THE PROCESS. WFP </p><p>WOULD BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL STAGES OF THE </p><p>EVALUATION AND ACT AS A FACILITATOR OF THE PROCESS, WHILE </p><p>THE DONORS ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT WILL ENSURE THE HIGH DEGREE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05511  131052Z </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE EVALUATION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. USMISSION SEES THIS BMZ PROPOSED INDEPENDENT EVALUATION </p><p>AND OFFER OF PARTIAL FUNDING AS BOTH TIMELY AND HIGHLY </p><p>DESIRABLE. THE REVIEW WILL ANALYZE BOTH THE STATUS OF WFP </p><p>PROGRESS RELATED TO ENGAGING HOST COUNTRY GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>INSTITUTIONS IN THE PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT </p><p>OF ITS DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH WFP </p><p>AND ITS UN SISTER AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY </p><p>LINK TOGETHER FOOD AID AND FOOD SECURITY STRATEGIES. </p><p>USMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT DCHA/FFP AND PPE GIVE DUE </p><p>CONSIDERATION TO PARTIAL FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED </p><p>EVALUATION.
