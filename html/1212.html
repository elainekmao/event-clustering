(C)  SUMMARY:  ALTHOUGH WIDESPREAD FEARS OF A </p><p>SPIKE IN VIOLENCE TO APRIL-MAY LEVELS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS HAVE SO FAR </p><p>PROVEN UNFOUNDED, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTURBING </p><p>SIGNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ZANU-PF ARE CONTINUING </p><p>THEIR PRE-ELECTION POLICY OF SPONSORING VIOLENCE AND </p><p>LAWLESSNESS.  DESPITE HOPES THAT THE OCCUPATION OF </p><p>FARMS BY WAR VETS WAS A PRE-ELECTION PLOY, FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS HAVE CONTINUED AND ABOUT 25 ADDITIONAL </p><p>FARMS HAVE BEEN INVADED.  FARMERS HAVE REPORTED </p><p>INCREASINGLY INTIMIDATING BEHAVIOR BY WAR VETS ON </p><p>THEIR FARMS, INCLUDING DEATH THREATS.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS SINCE THE </p><p>ELECTION IN WHICH POLICE AND SOLDIERS HAVE BEATEN UP </p><p>PEOPLE PERCEIVED AS SUPPORTERS OF THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE PROBABILITY OF LARGE-SCALE ELECTION- </p><p>RELATED RETALIATORY VIOLENCE IS RECEDING AS TIME </p><p>PASSES.  HOWEVER, WE NOTE THAT POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>HAS ALWAYS BEEN ORCHESTRATED FROM THE TOP AND THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT MAY ONCE AGAIN FIND A NEW SPATE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE -- AGAINST THE MDC, FARMERS, OR OTHER </p><p>PERCEIVED OPPONENTS -- TO BE IN HIS POLITICAL </p><p>INTEREST.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SITUATION ON FARMS REMAINS GRIM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03759  01 OF 03  111533Z </p><p>3.  (C)  BEFORE THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS, </p><p>THE OCCUPATION OF FARMS BY WAR VETS WAS USED AS AN </p><p>ELECTION PLOY AIMED AT RALLYING THE PUBLIC BEHIND </p><p>THE IDEA OF LAND REDISTRIBUTION.  IT WAS WIDELY </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE VETS WERE LIKELY TO LEAVE THE </p><p>FARMS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE </p><p>CASE.  THE VETS HAVE REMAINED ON OVER 1000 OCCUPIED </p><p>FARMS AND HAVE ESCALATED THE LEVEL OF VERBAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION AIMED AT FARMERS AND WORKERS, INCLUDING </p><p>THREATENED RETRIBUTION AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 25 NEW FARM </p><p>INVASIONS SINCE THE ELECTIONS.  IN A JULY 5 </p><p>STATEMENT, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) NOTED </p><p>THAT "THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER NOW AND YET THE </p><p>EXTORTION, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, THEFT AND THE </p><p>THREATS CONTINUE LARGELY UNABATED ON FARMS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE CFU TOLD US THAT, </p><p>FOLLOWING THE JULY 2 DEADLINE FOR FARMERS TO APPEAL </p><p>THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF 804 FARMS, WAR VETS </p><p>DEMANDED THAT THE FARMERS LEAVE THEIR LAND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  IN CONTRAST TO THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD, DURING WHICH MANY FARMERS WERE ALLOWED TO </p><p>CONTINUE RUNNING THEIR FARMS AS LONG AS THEY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE WAR VETS WERE IN CHARGE, </p><p>FARMERS ARE NOW IN MANY CASES BEING FORCED OFF THE </p><p>FARMS ALTOGETHER.  TONY REELER (PROTECT), DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE AMANI TRUST, AN NGO THAT ASSISTS VICTIMS OF </p><p>TORTURE AND OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, TOLD US </p><p>THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS DEATH THREATS AGAINST </p><p>FARMERS SINCE THE ELECTION.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03759  01 OF 03  111533Z </p><p>THE CFU REPORTS THAT THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>BY WAR VETERANS ON THE FARMS HAS DECREASED SINCE THE </p><p>ELECTION.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO POST-ELECTION REPORTS </p><p>OF KILLINGS ON FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF MDC MEMBERS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  A NUMBER OF EMBASSY CONTACTS, INCLUDING MDC </p><p>LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, HAVE REPORTED TO US THAT </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE POLICE AND MILITARY HAVE DESCENDED ON </p><p>NIGHTCLUBS IN HIGH-DENSITY HARARE SUBURBS ON RECENT </p><p>WEEKENDS AND ASSAULTED PATRONS THEY BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS.  THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF SIMILAR </p><p>INCIDENTS IN THE MIDLANDS PROVINCE CITY OF KWEKWE, </p><p>WHERE MINISTER OF JUSTICE EMMERSON MNANGAGWA LOST TO </p><p>THE MDC IN A HIGH-PROFILE RACE.  TONY REELER HAS </p><p>TOLD US THAT HIS ORGANIZATION IS RECEIVING A </p><p>"CONTINUING STREAM" OF VICTIMS WHO ARE PROVIDING </p><p>TESTIMONY OF CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND REPRISALS.  HIS </p><p>UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED </p><p>IN THE VIOLENCE TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THE POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUED IMPUNITY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7616 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03759  02 OF 03  111534Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------6CBC96  111534Z /38 </p><p>P 111538Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6568 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003759 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

(C)  A NUMBER OF EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE </p><p>EMPHASIZED TO US THAT THEY ARE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED </p><p>NOT ONLY ABOUT CONTINUING VIOLENCE BUT ABOUT </p><p>IMPUNITY FOR PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>NO ARRESTS IN ANY OF THE MORE THAN 30 CASES OF </p><p>POLITICALLY MOTIVATED MURDER SINCE FEBRUARY.  POLICE </p><p>HAVE FAILED TO LODGE CHARGES AGAINST PERSONS </p><p>WITNESSES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS THE PERPETRATORS OF </p><p>ACTS OF VIOLENCE, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE REFUSED </p><p>EVEN TO TAKE AFFIDAVITS FROM WITNESSES.  REELER </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT, EVEN IN THE SMALL MINORITY OF </p><p>CASES WHERE CHARGES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT, THE SEVERITY </p><p>OF THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN UNDERSTATED -- FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>PEOPLE GUILTY OF MURDER HAVE BEEN CHARGED ONLY WITH </p><p>PUBLIC VIOLENCE.  REELER TOLD US THAT IN A NUMBER OF </p><p>CASES, SUCH AS THE MURDER OF FARMER DAVID STEPEHENS, </p><p>THE POLICE HAVE REFUSED TO MAKE ARRESTS EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THEY ADMIT THAT THEY KNOW WHO THE CULPRITS ARE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI COMPLAINED </p><p>TO THE AMBASSADOR IN A JULY 10 MEETING (SEPTEL) THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS FALSELY IMPLICATED HIGH-LEVEL MDC </p><p>MEMBERS IN INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>NEWLY ELECTED MDC MP JUSTIN MUTENDADZAMERA HAD BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED ON JULY 6 FOR ALLEGEDLY SEVERELY ASSAULTING </p><p>A MAN WEARING A "VOTE YES" (FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM) T-SHIRT.   IN FACT, TSVANGIRAI SAID, THE </p><p>INCIDENT HAD BEEN A "SCUFFLE" BETWEEN GRASSROOTS- </p><p>LEVEL ZANU-PF AND MDC MEMBERS IN WHICH </p><p>MUTENDADZAMERA WAS NOT INVOLVED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03759  02 OF 03  111534Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE TO CALL, AS THEY HAVE SINCE </p><p>THE VIOLENCE BEGAN AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM IN FEBRUARY, FOR A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE.  TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON JULY 10 </p><p>THAT THE MDC WILL CALL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE VIOLENCE AS ONE OF </p><p>ITS FIRST ACTS AS THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>LEVEL OF ORCHESTRATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  OUR CONTACTS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO </p><p>SPECULATE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF ORCHESTRATION OF POST- </p><p>ELECTION VIOLENCE.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS FORUM, A GROUP </p><p>OF TEN LOCAL LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS, CONTINUES </p><p>TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AND PLANS TO ISSUE A BRIEF </p><p>REPORT ON POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN RECENT WEEKS. </p><p>PHIL MATSHEZA (PROTECT), EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION TRUST OF </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA, TOLD DCM ON JULY 6 THAT HE DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE A SENSE THAT THE POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE IS </p><p>BEING DIRECTED FROM SENIOR LEVELS OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AT THIS STAGE.  ABSENT A DECISION BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO LAUNCH ANOTHER SPATE OF ORCHESTRATED </p><p>AGGRESSION, HE CONTINUED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT VIOLENCE WILL BURN ITSELF OUT IN A FEW </p><p>WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03759  02 OF 03  111534Z </p><p>10.  (C)  OTHERS, HOWEVER, HAVE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE HERE IS GENERALLY ORCHESTRATED AT </p><p>THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF UNIFORMED </p><p>SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE VIOLENCE POINTS TO HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>COMPLICITY.  THERE IS ALSO WIDESPREAD CONCERN THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT RELATIVE QUIET, COMPARED TO THE APRIL- </p><p>MAY PERIOD, MAY MERELY BE A LULL BEFORE MORE </p><p>POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED RETRIBUTION FROM BOTH SIDES </p><p>BEGINS.  MANY OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE REMINDED US THAT </p><p>THERE WAS A PERIOD OF RELATIVE PEACE BETWEEN </p><p>FEBRUARY 13, WHEN PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM WAS DEFEATED, AND APRIL 1, WHEN THE WAR </p><p>VETS ATTACKED A PEACEFUL NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY MARCH IN HARARE AND THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE LAND INVASIONS BEGAN IN EARNEST. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD RELIEF THAT </p><p>POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE HAS NOT REACHED APRIL-MAY </p><p>LEVELS.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>MORE RETALIATORY VIOLENCE IF ZANU-PF HAD LOST OR IF </p><p>THE MDC HAD LOST BY A LARGER MARGIN.  HOWEVER, GIVEN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7617 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03759  03 OF 03  111534Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------6CBCA1  111534Z /38 </p><p>P 111538Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6569 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003759 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT VIOLENCE, LIKE THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE, IS BEING ORCHESTRATED FROM THE TOP.  THE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT OF UNIFORMED SERVICE MEMBERS IN VIOLENCE </p><p>IS A SIGN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DEVELOPING NEW </p><p>TACTICS OF INTIMIDATION IN THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD. </p><p>THE OVERALL LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN COMING MONTHS IS </p><p>LIKELY TO DEPEND, AS IT HAS IN THE PAST, ON WHETHER </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE BELIEVES THAT VIOLENCE IS IN ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S POLITICAL INTEREST.  THE PRESIDENT AND ZANU-PF </p><p>ARE REELING FROM THE PARTY\'S ELECTION DEFEAT AND MAY </p><p>NOT HAVE DECIDED WHAT NEXT STEPS TO TAKE.
