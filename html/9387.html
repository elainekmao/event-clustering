<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003141 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: FIRST REACTION: SHAYKH SABAH APPOINTS NEW CABINET </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA U/S Ahmed Al-Jarallah shared the names of newly </p><p>appointed Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah\'s </p><p>cabinet with the Ambassador on July 14.  U/S Jarallah said </p><p>the names would be formally announced later the same day. </p><p>Following is a list of the new cabinet and initial reactions, </p><p>in no particular order: </p><p> </p><p>First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior - Shaykh </p><p>Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah </p><p> </p><p>A brother of both the Amir and Shaykh Sabah, Shaykh Nawaf has </p><p>previously served as Minister of Interior and Minister of </p><p>Defense, both before the Gulf War.  While it came as no </p><p>surprise that former Minister of Interior Mohammed Khaled </p><p>al-Sabah was replaced, (his relationship with Shaykh Sabah </p><p>has been decidedly and publically strained) the choice of </p><p>Shaykh Nawaf to fill his shoes is somewhat disappointing, </p><p>given that Shaykh Nawaf has a reputation of being a </p><p>less-than-forceful Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense - Shaykh Jabir </p><p>al-Mubarak al-Sabah </p><p> </p><p>Although low-key, Minister Jabir proved an important ally in </p><p>completing U.S. requested preparatory tasks prior to OIF. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister of Labor and </p><p>Social Affairs - Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah </p><p> </p><p>The promotion of Dr. Mohammed to Foreign Minister was </p><p>expected, although he was repeatedly challenged for the post </p><p>by current Minister of Amiri Diwan Affairs Shaykh Nasser </p><p>Mohammed al-Sabah.  He has served ably as Minister of State </p><p>for Foreign Affairs since his return from Washington, and is </p><p>very close to Shaykh Sabah.  The addition of Minister of </p><p>Labor and Social Affairs to his portfolio may aid us </p><p>significantly in our efforts to strengthen labor laws and </p><p>protection for third country workers. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Health - Dr. Mohammed al-Jarallah </p><p> </p><p>An able technocrat, al-Jarallah worked well with with the </p><p>U.S. military before and during OIF. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Information - Mohammed Abulhasan </p><p> </p><p>A career diplomat who has served Kuwait well as its U.N. </p><p>PermRep, Abulhasan brings to the table a very astute </p><p>political sense and a keen understanding of U.S. interests. </p><p>His appointment as Minister of Information may be meant as a </p><p>signal to Islamists -- who view the Ministries of Information </p><p>and Education as the high ground in their ideological battle </p><p>-- that the new government will not be cowed by them. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Education - Dr. Rasheed al-Hamad </p><p> </p><p>A close relative of Arab Fund Director and former Finance </p><p>Minister Abdullatif al-Hamad, Rasheed al-Hamad is a former </p><p>A/S of Education who has spent his entire career working in </p><p>the field.  Although competent, we expect he will have little </p><p>political clout. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water - </p><p>Shaykh Ahmed Fahad </p><p> </p><p>The appointment of Shaykh Ahmed Fahad to these two key </p><p>ministries is indicative of his status as a contender for the </p><p>next generation of Kuwaiti leadership.  Further, and more </p><p>importantly for the USG, it may signal Prime Minister Shaykh </p><p>Sabah al-Ahmed\'s intention to bring to fruition the long </p><p>delayed AZN power plant and Northern Oilfields projects. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Housing - Badr al-Humaidhi </p><p> </p><p>The long-time director of the Kuwait fund, al-Humaidhi is an </p><p>interesting choice for a Ministry locally known as the </p><p>"Ministry of Problems," due to large numbers of squabbles and </p><p>complaints it must adjudicate and respond to. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Communications - Shaykh Ahmed Abdullah al-Sabah </p><p>retains his portfolio. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Justice - Ahmed Baquer </p><p> </p><p>A chemist by trade and a Salafi MP, Ahmed Baquer retains his </p><p>post as Minister of Justice, while losing the Ministry of </p><p>Awqaf. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Awqaf - Abdullah al-Matooq, whom we are told is a </p><p>member of the Muslim Brotherhood. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Finance - Mahmoud al-Nouri </p><p>Mahmoud al-Nouri is the Chairman of Global Investment House, </p><p>a former Chairman of Kuwait Transport Co and brother of </p><p>former Minister of Education Anwar al-Nouri.  Unlike his </p><p>predecessor, Yousef Ibrahim, al-Nouri is not an economist. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Trade - Abdullah Taweel </p><p>A liberal with a degree in Computer Science, Taweel is a </p><p>former chairman of the Kuwait Computing Society. </p><p>2. (C) The new cabinet has caused no great excitement among </p><p>those of our contacts who are privy to these appointments. </p><p>Post will continue to analyze these developments and provide </p><p>a more in-depth analysis as more information becomes </p><p>available.  Overall, it appears that Shaykh Sabah has chosen </p><p>a cabinet that will largely maintain the status-quo. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
