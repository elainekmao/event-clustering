<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 08792 </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO PASS AID/APRE </p><p>MANILA FOR AMB. PLATT </p><p>USIA FOR NEA - RUGH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12536: DECL:N.A. </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHARIA--WHERE DID IT GO? </p><p> </p><p>1. LOU- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  ONE MONTH AGO, THE LEADING TOPIC OF POLITICAL </p><p>DISCUSSION IN MUCH OF PAKISTAN WAS THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S SHARIA BILL, OSTENSIBLY MEANT TO </p><p>"ISLAMIZE" PAKISTANI LAWS, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY. </p><p>DEBATE RAGED IN THE PRESS BETWEEN CRITICS FROM THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS RIGHT, WHO ARGUED THAT THE BILL WAS TOO </p><p>WEAK, AND LIBERALS WHO PREDICTED IT WOULD--AT A </p><p>MINIMUM--INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND </p><p>MINORITIES.  DAILY EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, AND </p><p>INTERVIEWS HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIONS OF COMPETING </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEADERS.  THE BILL\'S </p><p>INTRODUCTION INTO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON MAY 12 </p><p>THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL LINE-UP, WITH </p><p>THE SECULAR PDA, ANP, AND MQM ALLIED WITH THE </p><p>ISLAMIST PARTIES AGAINST THE BILL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN CONTRAST TO POPULAR EXPECTATIONS, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GENERAL PREOCCUPATION WITH SHARIA DISAPPEARED </p><p>ALMOST OVERNIGHT AFTER ITS MAY 16 PASSAGE BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  SHARIA\'S PASSAGE BY THE SENATE </p><p>ON MAY 28 DREW LITTLE NOTICE--THE SENATE MADE NO </p><p>CHANGES, ESSENTIALLY RUBBER-STAMPING THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S DECISION.  AT THE TIME, BOTH THE PRESS </p><p>AND MEMBERS OF NAWAZ\'S IJI COALITION PREDICTED </p><p>PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN WOULD SIGN THE BILL INTO </p><p>LAW WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.  THREE WEEKS LATER, </p><p>HOWEVER, SHARIA HAS LARGELY DISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC </p><p>DISCUSSION.  A SURVEY OF PAKISTAN\'S LEADING DAILIES </p><p>FOUND NO MENTION EITHER OF PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ </p><p>KHAN\'S UNEXPLAINED DELAY IN SIGNING IT, OR OF HIS </p><p>FINALLY SIGNING SHARIA INTO LAW ON JUNE 14.  A TRUE </p><p>NON-EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. WE BELIEVE MOST OF THIS SUDDEN DECLINE OF </p><p>INTEREST IS DUE TO NAWAZ\'S SUCCESS IN CREATING AN </p><p>ACT THAT IS LONG ON RHETORIC BUT BRINGS NO IMMEDIATE </p><p>CHANGE TO PAKISTANIS\' DAILY LIVES.  WHILE THERE WAS </p><p>STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR LANGUAGE THAT COULD--FOR </p><p>BETTER OR WORSE--AFFECT PAKISTANI\'S LIVING </p><p>CONDITIONS, THE ACT WAS OF INTENSE INTEREST.  MANY </p><p>LIBERALS, WOMEN AND MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES REMAIN </p><p>LEARY OF THE SHARIA LEGISLATION--CITING, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ABUSES OF THE HADOOD (ISLAMIC PUNISHMENT) </p><p>ORDINANCES UNDER GENERAL ZIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW </p><p>RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED LEGISLATION CAN BE TWISTED TO </p><p>FIT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  EVEN THEY, HOWEVER, HAVE </p><p>ADMITTED TO US THAT THE TEXT OF THE ACT ITSELF IS </p><p>LESS AN ISSUE THAN THE DEPARTURES THIS OR A FUTURE </p><p>REGIME MIGHT TAKE FROM THE LETTER OF THE LAW.  (THE </p><p>PUNATIVE ARTICLES OF THE HADOOD ORDINANCE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ENFORCED WHILE </p><p>ACCOMPANYING PROTECTIONS GIVEN WOMEN HAVE OFTEN </p><p>FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE.)  CRITICS SUCH AS THE PDA\'S </p><p>AITZAZ AHSAN ARE, IN FACT, MORE CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>BILL\'S VAGUENESS--ALLOWING NEW INTERPRETATIONS "AT </p><p>WILL"--THAN OF ANY MANDATE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>ACT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE AMENDMENTS INSERTED INTO THE ACT DURING THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATE HAVE HELPED DEFUSE THE </p><p>ISSUE FOR MOST PAKISTANIS.  THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY </p><p>APPROVED AN AMENDMENT, JOINTLY PROPOSED BY FIVE </p><p>MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES, STATING THAT "NOTHING </p><p>CONTAINED HEREUNDER SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE </p><p>NON-MUSLIMS GUARANTEED BY OR UNDER THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION."  SIMILARLY, NAWAZ READILY AGREED TO </p><p>AN AMENDMENT STATING "THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS </p><p>GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED </p><p>(BY SHARIA)."  A THIRD AMENDMENT, PROPOSED BY THE </p><p>SECULAR ANP AS THE PRICE OF THEIR SUPPORT, STATES </p><p>THAT "NOTHING CONTAINED HERE SHALL AFFECT PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM."  THE INITIAL </p><p>THREE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR THE ABOLITION OF INTEREST </p><p>WAS REPLACING IT WITH THE VAGUE "SHORTEST POSSIBLE </p><p>TIME."  ANOTHER AMENDMENT, DEFINING THE QURAN AND </p><p>SUNNAH AS THE SOURCE OF PAKISTANI LAW--RATHER THAN </p><p>THE SUM TOTAL OF LAW, IN AND OF ITSELF--ESSENTIALLY </p><p>BLOCKS ATTEMPTS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTION OR </p><p>LEGISLATING WITH CITATIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE QURAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED DURING THE </p><p>WEEKS BETWEEN NAWAZ\'S PROPOSAL OF SHARIA AND ITS </p><p>PASSAGE BY PARLIAMENT WILL REMAIN HIGH ON PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA FOR YEARS TO COME.  IN </p><p>FACT, THE BILL WAS ADVERTISED AS ONLY BEING A BROAD </p><p>COMMITTMENT TO AN ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MUST LATER BE </p><p>FLESHED OUT BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION DRAFTED TO </p><p>CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BASIC LAW. WIDE </p><p>DIFFERENCES REMAIN WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY OVER THE </p><p>PROPER ROLE OF RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND </p><p>SOCIETY, WITH A SMALL BUT VOCAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT </p><p>STILL DETERMINED TO DICTATE ITS VIEWS TO SOCIETY AT </p><p>LARGE.  SIMILARLY, A COALITION OF WOMEN\'S, MINORITY, </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS REMAIN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE ACT.  WHILE THEY TELL US THEY RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>SHARIA ACT IS A FAIT ACOMPLI, THEY ARE MOBILIZING </p><p>AGAINST FUTURE SHARIA-RELATED LEGISLATION. </p><p>THEREFORE, WHILE THE SHARIA ACT PASSED BY THE </p><p>PAKISTANI PARLIAMENT IN MAY 1991 DOES NOT, IN THE </p><p>END, REPRESENT THE TYPE OF ATTACK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES </p><p>MANY IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE FEARED, THE CONCERN </p><p>OVER THE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL </p><p>REMAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
