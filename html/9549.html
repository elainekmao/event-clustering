Dailies </p><p>predict that Gul will discuss the issue of Turkey\'s </p><p>contribution to Iraqi peacekeeping, and the terrorist </p><p>presence of the PKK in Northern Iraq.  Weekend papers </p><p>quote Gul as denying press reports that Turkey had </p><p>agreed to pull back troops from the region.  Gul said </p><p>his visit will open a new chapter in strategic </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish contribution to Iraqi peacekeeping: The Turkish </p><p>military\'s 28th Peace Brigade has started preparations </p><p>for an Iraqi peacekeeping mission, Monday\'s "Hurriyet" </p><p>reported.  The GOT is positive in principle about </p><p>joining the peacekeeping mission in Iraq, but wants </p><p>clarification of the status and location of its troops. </p><p>The ruling AKP is expected to submit to the parliament </p><p>a motion in late July to deploy about 5,000 troops in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson\'s farewell interview: U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara, W. Robert Pearson, gave an </p><p>exclusive interview to "Hurrriyet" on Sunday.  Pearson </p><p>voiced regret over the Suleymaniye incident.  He said </p><p>the U.S. was waiting to see the impact of the </p><p>Repentance Law for defectors from terror organizations. </p><p>`PKK/KADEK terrorists will either surrender or face the </p><p>alternative, which is removal of their presence in </p><p>Northern Iraq through military force,\' Ambassador </p><p>Pearson stressed.  Pearson said the GOT had given U.S. </p><p>assurances last year regarding a northern front for </p><p>Iraq.  `The refusal of the related motion by the </p><p>parliament was a big disappointment for all sides,\' </p><p>Pearson noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In a statement following the departure of visiting U.S. </p><p>Generals Jones and Abizaid on Saturday, Ambassador </p><p>Pearson said the visits were a reaffirmation of the </p><p>close ties between the militaries of the two NATO </p><p>allies.  Pearson confirmed that Turkey\'s contribution </p><p>to Iraqi peacekeeping activities was discussed </p><p>`informally\' during the meetings in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Generals\' Turkey visit: EUCOM Commander General </p><p>James Jones, and CENTCOM Chairman General John Abizaid </p><p>came to Ankara on Friday to take the pulse of the </p><p>Turkish leadership and strengthen mutual confidence in </p><p>the wake of the Suleymaniye incident.  The generals </p><p>reportedly asked Ankara to send at least a brigade to </p><p>Iraq to help in infrastructure work and to assist in </p><p>the training of an Iraqi army and police force.  The </p><p>sides have also discussed the possibility of a joint </p><p>operation against the PKK.  Dailies believe the U.S. is </p><p>working on a formula acceptable to Ankara and the </p><p>Kurdish groups in Northern Iraq in order to remove the </p><p>PKK/KADEK presence from the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq and US-Turkey relations/WMD </p><p>controversy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Repair of US-Turkey relations goes through Iraq " </p><p>Yasemin Congar commented on the upcoming visit by FM </p><p>Gul to Washington in the mass appeal "Milliyet" (7/21): </p><p>"Turkey needs a new policy for northern Iraq to ensure </p><p>that incidents such as the one in Suleymaniye will not </p><p>occur again.  It should also make sure that Turkey </p><p>would never be involved in improper acts in the region, </p><p>which were depicted by US authorities as `paramilitary\' </p><p>activities.  All of this can only be achieved if new </p><p>policies are made and implemented not only by the </p><p>military, but also under the supervision of Turkey\'s </p><p>political authority.  The upcoming visit of Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul to Washington will provide an opportunity </p><p>to deepen the bilateral dialogue.  Yet a solid basis of </p><p>trust in the bilateral relationship can only be </p><p>achieved once Turkey takes steps to change its policy </p><p>in Iraq.  The way to heal the Turkish-American </p><p>relationship goes is to deal directly with the wound - </p><p>that is, in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The change of US thinking after 9/11" </p><p>Tufan Turenc argued in the mass appeal "Hurriyet" </p><p>(7/21): "It is becoming more obvious every day that </p><p>both Bush and Blair lied to the whole world as well as </p><p>their own people in order to justify the Iraq </p><p>operation.  President Bush may have been acting in a </p><p>rather irrational way because of the "September 11 </p><p>psychology," but there is no way to understand Blair\'s </p><p>position. President Bush is likely to lose the upcoming </p><p>elections for having led the United States into the </p><p>"Iraq swamp." . The incident in Suleymaniye and the way </p><p>the Turkish soldiers were treated is another example of </p><p>the post-9/11 syndrome.  . The normalization of Turkish- </p><p>American relations can only come once Bush and the neo- </p><p>conservatives leave power in the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
