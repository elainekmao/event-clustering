SUMMARY. THE ITALIAN ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO REMAIN </p><p>SOMEWHAT WEAK OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD.  GDP GROWTH IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE AN ANEMIC 1.3 PERCENT IN 2002. THE </p><p>GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES TO DAMPEN </p><p>ITALIAN EXPORTS, AND HEIGHTEN CONSUMER UNCERTAINTY. </p><p>THE CONVERSION TO THE EURO HAS PUSHED UP INFLATION TO </p><p>2.4 PERCENT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>PROBLEM OF A SPIRALING PUBLIC DEFICIT. OPPOSITION FROM </p><p>TRADE UNIONS, WHICH HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SOCIAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKING, HAS STALLED PROGRESS ON </p><p>KEY LABOR AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT THE RIGHT MIX OF FISCAL POLICIES AND </p><p>BEGIN TO ENACT SIGNIFICANT REFORMS FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY TO BE STRONG.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GDP GROWTH: 2002 </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02958  01 OF 10  181526Z </p><p> </p><p>2. GDP GROWTH IN ITALY CONTINUES TO DECELERATE.  THE </p><p>GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IS HURTING ITALIAN EXPORTS TO </p><p>ITS MAJOR MARKETS: THE U.S. AND GERMANY.  CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND SIGNS OF </p><p>INCREASED INFLATION HAVE DEPRESSED CONSUMER DEMAND. </p><p>EVEN THE ANEMIC GDP GROWTH IN 2001 OF 1.8 PERCENT MAY </p><p>SURPASS GROWTH IN 2002.  THE MOST PESSIMISTIC FORECAST </p><p>IS A GROWTH RATE OF 1.3 PERCENT.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MAINTAINS THAT GROWTH WILL BE AROUND 2.3 PERCENT, BUT </p><p>HAS CONCEDED THAT IT COULD BE AS LOW AS 1.3 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE LATEST DATA ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ARE </p><p>DISAPPOINTING. ON A YEARTO-YEAR BASIS, INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO REGISTER A DECLINE. IN THE </p><p>FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF 2002, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WAS </p><p>DOWN 3.5 PERCENT OVER THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF </p><p>PREVIOUS YEAR.  APRIL HOLIDAYS AND THE GENERAL STRIKES </p><p>HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION THAT </p><p>POSTED AN ANEMIC 0.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN APRIL.  A </p><p>MODEST RECOVERY IS EXPECTED IN MAY. (NOTE: 17 MILLION </p><p>HOURS HAVE BEEN LOST TO STRIKES THROUGH APRIL 2002, UP </p><p>1,317.4 PERCENT OVER THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF </p><p>2001.) EVEN WITH BETTER RESULTS IN MAY, INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PRODUCTION THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF 2002 STILL </p><p>WOULD BE ONE TO TWO PERCENT BELOW THE CORRESPONDING </p><p>PERIOD IN 2001. </p><p> </p><p>4. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS FALLING, </p><p>AFTER RISING IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2002, TO </p><p>LEVELS SIMILAR TO THOSE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02958  01 OF 10  181526Z </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11. A SIGN OF THE TIMES: CAR SALES DROPPED </p><p>BY 11 PERCENT FROM APRIL TO MAY AND BY 12.7 PERCENT </p><p>FROM JANUARY TO MAY OVER 2001 SALES.  CONSUMERS ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN </p><p>GENERAL AND ABOUT INCREASED INFLATION IN PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>5. THESE TRENDS, IF THEY CONTINUE, WOULD DECELERATE </p><p>GDP GROWTH FROM THE 1.8 PERCENT REGISTERED IN 2001 TO </p><p>1.3 PERCENT IN 2002.  THIS IS FAIRLY IN LINE WITH THE </p><p>AVERAGE GROWTH RATE IN THE EURO AREA, BUT HIGHER THAN </p><p>GERMANY.  ACCORDING TO THE CONSENSUS FORECAST OF </p><p>ITALIAN RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, EVEN IF GDP GROWTH </p><p>ACCELERATED IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2002, GDP GROWTH </p><p>WILL NOT MAKE UP GROUND LOST IN 2001.  THE CONSENSUS </p><p>FORECAST, WHICH WE SHARE, IS THAT GDP GROWTH IN 2002 </p><p>WILL BE 1.3 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. TWO OTHER COMPONENTS OF DOMESTIC DEMAND, PRIVATE </p><p>CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT, WILL SUPPORT WHATEVER GDP </p><p>GROWTH OCCURS.  PRIVATE CONSUMPTION IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>ACCELERATE SLIGHTLY FROM 1.1 PERCENT IN 2001 TO 1.3 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2002, WHILE INVESTMENT IS EXPECTED TO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0868 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02958  02 OF 10  181526Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     UTED-00  FOE-00   VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   IPS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------BEF322  181526Z /07 </p><p>P 181132Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC 4273 </p><p>INFO USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2707 </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 10 ROME 002958 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>PARIS ALSO FOR USOECD </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, JONES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02958  02 OF 10  181526Z </p><p>STATE PASS CEA </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>USDOC 6800/ITA/TD/OTEA/TISD/HSCHULTZ AND </p><p>4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ELAB, KPRP, IT, </p><p>SUBJECT: ECONOMIC FORECAST FOR ITALY 2002-2003: JUNE </p><p>2002 PREDICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>ACCELERATE FROM 2.4 PERCENT IN 2001 TO 2.5 PERCENT </p><p>THIS YEAR.  HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>INCREASE SLIGHTLY AS A RESULT OF THE MINOR INCREASE IN </p><p>WAGES.  THESE INCREASED WAGES ARE, HOWEVER, PARTLY </p><p>OFFSET BY LOSS IN INCOME FROM STOCKS. (NOTE: STOCK </p><p>INDICES DROPPED 25.1 PERCENT IN 2001). CONSUMPTION </p><p>WILL ALSO BE TEMPERED BY INCREASED INFLATION, WHICH IS </p><p>A RESULT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES, AND THE IMPACT OF THE </p><p>ECONOMIC CRISIS IN ARGENTINA.  (NOTE: THE LEADING </p><p>CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS ESTIMATE THAT 450,000 PRIVATE </p><p>ITALIAN INVESTORS HOLD ARGENTINE ASSETS.) </p><p> </p><p>7. PUBLIC CONSUMPTION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN 2002. </p><p>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED EU-MANDATED BUDGET </p><p>TARGETS ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THEIR </p><p>PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, AS A SHARE OF GDP, IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>DECLINE FROM 17.6 PERCENT IN 2001 TO 17.4 PERCENT IN </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>OUR FORECAST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02958  02 OF 10  181526Z </p><p> </p><p>GDP COMPONENT AS PCT OF GDP2001    2002 </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE CONSUMPTION 59.8      59.8 </p><p>PUBLIC CONSUMPTION17.6      17.4 </p><p>INVESTMENT20.8      21.0 </p><p>0.8Q      21.0 </p><p>INVENTORIES -0.2      -0.1 </p><p>EXPORTS30.3      30.3 </p><p>IMPORTS28.3      28.5 </p><p>GDP    100.0     100.0 </p><p> </p><p>8.

END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>9. PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE UP, PRIMARILY </p><p>AS A RESULT OF TAX INCENTIVES PROVIDED IN THE TREMONTI </p><p>LAW.  THIS LAW GIVES TAX BENEFITS FOR REINVESTED </p><p>PROFITS. INVESTMENT GREW 2.4 PERCENT IN 2001 AND IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY 2.5 PERCENT BOTH IN 2002 AND </p><p>2003. THE EFFECTS OF THE TREMONTI LAW ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>BE GREATEST IN THE LAST HALF OF 2002 AND FIRST HALF OF </p><p>2003. THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF THE TAX INCENTIVES ON </p><p>PRIVATE INVESTMENT WILL BE PARTLY OFFSET BY THE </p><p>EXPECTED DECELERATION IN PUBLIC INVESTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>GDP GROWTH: 2003 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02958  02 OF 10  181526Z </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>003 </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. GDP IS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE GRADUALLY TO 2.4 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2003, SUPPORTED BY DOMESTIC DEMAND AND A </p><p>RECOVERY OF EXPORTS.  REDUCED INFLATIONARY PRESSURES </p><p>AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE STOCK MARKET ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>BOOST HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND PRIVATE CONSUMPTION. </p><p>CONSUMPTION MAY BE SLIGHTLY TEMPERED, HOWEVER, BY THE </p><p>EXPECTED INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

MEASURES INCLUDE: </p><p>A. A FIVE-PERCENT CUT IN GOI PAYMENTS TO </p><p>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI </p><p>EXPECTS THIS MEASURE TO PRODUCE 500 MILLION EUROS IN </p><p>SAVINGS.  PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING U.S.- </p><p>OWNED FIRMS, HAVE OBJECTED STRONGLY TO THIS PRICE CUT; </p><p>B.

THE ROUNDING UP OF PRICES FOLLOWING THE EURO </p><p>CHANGEOVER AND HIGHER PRICES FOR AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTED FROM AN UNUSUALLY COLD </p><p>WINTER, PUSHED UP INFLATION IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS </p><p>YEAR.
