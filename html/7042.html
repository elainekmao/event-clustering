(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Sana\'a Al-Kitbi (strictly protect), Secretary- </p><p>General of the UAE Red Crescent Authority, told us on </p><p>the afternoon of April 2 that all UAE Red Crescent </p><p>humanitarian relief activities in Iraq are on hold. </p><p>The reason is that the Iraqis have officially refused </p><p>permission to the UAE to deliver aid in regime- </p><p>controlled areas.  Al-Kitbi said that as a result of </p><p>the Iraqi decision, the only place the UAE could </p><p>deliver its aid would be Umm Qasr and its environs. </p><p>(Note:  The Red Crescent had been planning to deliver </p><p>aid across the country, focusing on the neediest </p><p>areas, many of which they judge to be in regime- </p><p>controlled territory.  End note.)  The entire issue of </p><p>humanitarian aid for Iraq has now become -- because of </p><p>Iraq\'s refusal to cooperate -- a matter of enormous </p><p>political sensitivity.  RCA humanitarian aid shipments </p><p>must wait until the UAE leadership decides how best to </p><p>respond. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  Al-Kitbi had earlier told us that </p><p>while Baghdad might refuse aid from Saudi Arabia and </p><p>Kuwait, she was confident that the Iraqis would grant </p><p>permission for Emirati relief activities because of </p><p>the UAE\'s long and close association with the Iraqi </p><p>Red Crescent Society (see reftel).  That assessment </p><p>appears to have been incorrect.  The Ambassador has </p><p>requested an early appointment with MFA Minstate (and </p><p>RCA Chairman) Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid, and will use </p><p>the opportunity of that meeting to press for the UAE </p><p>to move forward to deliver its much-needed aid to </p><p>those areas in Iraq where it will be safe for them to </p><p>do so -- noting that that area is expanding every day. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
