(C) SUMMARY: THE DECEMBER 27 DEATH OF SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE SIMBARASHE MUCHECHETERE AND THE DECEMBER 31 </p><p>RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY BRINGS INTO </p><p>QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF WHAT HAS STOOD AS AN AFRICAN </p><p>MODEL OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.  ONLY TWO OF THE SIX </p><p>REMAINING MEMBERS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS VERIFIABLY </p><p>INDEPENDENT.  CHIEF JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU HAS </p><p>ALREADY PROVEN HIMSELF AS AN INSTRUMENT OF ZANU-PF, AND </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE REMAINING THREE JUSTICES REMAINS UNCLEAR, </p><p>DESPITE INITIAL INDICATIONS THAT THEY TOO MAY BE </p><p>FAVORABLE TO THE ZANU-PF AGENDA.  HOW GROUPS PLANNING </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO PENDING REPRESSIVE </p><p>LEGISLATION FARE IN THEIR LEGAL CASES WILL CLARIFY THE </p><p>ULTIMATE POSTURE OF THE BENCH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LOSS OF TWO INDEPENDENTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) EARLY ON DECEMBER 27, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE </p><p>SIMBARASHE MUCHECHETERE, AGE 57, DIED IN HIS BULAWAYO </p><p>HOME, REPORTEDLY FROM MALARIA COMPLICATIONS. </p><p>MUCHECHETERE\'S SUDDEN DEATH CAME AS A SURPRISE BECAUSE </p><p>HE WAS BELIEVED TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH.  HE WAS WELL- </p><p>REGARDED ON THE BENCH, ON WHICH HE HAD SERVED SINCE </p><p>1993, AND WAS GENERALLY VIEWED AS INDEPENDENT OF PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00038  01 OF 02  041117Z </p><p>POLITICS.  ON DECEMBER 31, JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY </p><p>OFFICIALLY RETIRED FROM THE HIGHEST COURT AFTER REACHING </p><p>THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF 70.  (NOTE: ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>JUDGES NORMALLY MUST RETIRE AT 65, BUT IF THEY CAN </p><p>DEMONSTRATE GOOD MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH TO A DOCTOR, </p><p>THEY CAN STAY ON TO THE AGE OF 70, AFTER WHICH NO </p><p>EXTENSION IS POSSIBLE.  END NOTE.)  IN FEBRUARY 2001, </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA ATTEMPTED TO FORCE </p><p>MCNALLY INTO EARLY RETIREMENT -- AFTER SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>DOING SO WITH CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY -- BUT </p><p>MCNALLY RESISTED.  MCNALLY WAS KNOWN LOCALLY FOR HIS </p><p>RESPECT OF THE LAW.  (NOTE: THE JANUARY 3 EDITION OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" REPORTED THAT HIGH </p><p>COURT JUDGE DAVID BARTLETT UNEXPECTEDLY RESIGNED ON </p><p>DECEMBER 31; BARTLETT COULD LEAVE OFFICE AS SOON AS </p><p>FEBRUARY 28.  BARTLETT IS THE FOURTH HIGH COURT JUDGE TO </p><p>RESIGN IN THE LAST YEAR.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE IS CLOSER TO HAVING HIS IDEAL COURT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE DEPARTURE OF TWO INDEPENDENT JUSTICES LEAVES </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ZANU- </p><p>PF.  MUGABE REPLACED GUBBAY WITH ZANU-PF SYCOPHANT </p><p>GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU AND APPOINTED THREE NEW MEMBERS TO </p><p>THE BENCH IN AUGUST 2001, EXPANDING THE BENCH FROM FIVE </p><p>TO EIGHT MEMBERS.  OF THE SIX REMAINING MEMBERS, ONLY </p><p>TWO CAN BE DESCRIBED AS INDEPENDENT; THE OTHER FOUR ARE </p><p>BEGINNING TO LOOK AMENABLE TO THE RULING PARTY\'S LEGAL </p><p>AGENDA.  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE </p><p>REMAINING SIX: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00038  01 OF 02  041117Z </p><p> </p><p>-- CHIEF JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, AGE 54: FORMER </p><p>JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH COURT, BECAME ACTING CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE IN MARCH 2001 AFTER GUBBAY WAS FORCED TO RETIRE; </p><p>OFFICIALLY APPOINTED IN AUGUST 2001.  CHIDYAUSIKU\'S </p><p>LINKS TO ZANU-PF ARE WIDELY KNOWN: HE SERVED IN TWO </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERIAL POSITIONS IN THE EARLY 1980S AND WAS </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION </p><p>IN 1999; OUR CONTACTS TELL US HE IS ALSO SLATED TO </p><p>RECEIVE PROPERTY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.  CHIDYAUSIKU WROTE THE DECEMBER </p><p>3, 2001 DECISION THAT ESSENTIALLY LEGALIZED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SEIZURE OF COMMERCIAL FARMING PROPERTY (REF </p><p>A).  A GROUP OF BLACK ZIMBABWEAN LAWYERS CIRCULATED A </p><p>LETTER BEFORE CHIDYAUSIKU\'S APPOINTMENT CALLING HIM </p><p>"MORALLY UNFIT" TO SERVE AS CHIEF JUSTICE AND CITED </p><p>CASES OF WOMANIZING, PUBLIC OUTBURSTS, SEXUAL </p><p>HARASSMENT, AND PHYSICAL ASSAULT. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUSTICE MISHECK CHEDA: JUDGE OF THE BULAWAYO HIGH </p><p>COURT FROM 1991 UNTIL HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT IN AUGUST 2001; SERVED AS PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR </p><p>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 1989-1991.  CHEDA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED </p><p>AS A SOUND JUDGE AND IS A FORMER CRITIC OF CHIDYAUSIKU\'S </p><p>PRO-GOVERNMENT RULINGS.  HOWEVER, CHEDA WENT ALONG WITH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6230 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00038  02 OF 02  041117Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------533A36  041118Z /38 </p><p>O 040833Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0644 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000038 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LOSS OF TWO ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES </p><p>STRENGTHENS ZANU-PF\'S INFLUENCE OVER BENCH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00038  02 OF 02  041117Z </p><p>THE DECEMBER LAND DECISION LEGALIZING FARM SEIZURES. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUSTICE LUKE MALABA: JUDGE OF THE BULAWAYO HIGH COURT </p><p>FROM 1994 UNTIL HIS APPOINTMENT IN AUGUST 2001; ONCE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST CAPABLE LAWYERS IN </p><p>MATABELELAND; HAS A STRONG HUMAN RIGHTS BACKGROUND, BUT </p><p>SIGNED ONTO THE DECEMBER LAND RULING. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUSTICE VERNANDA ZIYAMBI: THE FIRST FEMALE ZIMBABWE </p><p>SUPREME COURT JUSTICE; FORMER JUDGE OF THE HARARE HIGH </p><p>COURT.  ZIYAMBI HAS SOMEWHAT WEAKER LEGAL CREDENTIALS </p><p>THAN HER COUNTERPARTS, BUT IS REPORTED TO HAVE STRONG </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS.  ZIYAMBI\'S HUSBAND WAS MINISTER </p><p>OF JUSTICE UNTIL HE DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN 1991. </p><p>ZIYAMBI\'S CHILDREN REPORTEDLY BLAME ZANU-PF FOR </p><p>ORCHESTRATING HIS DEATH, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER </p><p>ZIYAMBI DOES AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUSTICE AHMED IBRAHIM, AGE 64: THE LONGEST-SERVING </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CURRENT BENCH (SINCE 1990); THE MOST </p><p>PROMINENT MUSLIM IN ZIMBABWE AND PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL </p><p>ISLAMIC CULTURAL SOCIETY; WELL-KNOWN FOR HIS RESPECT OF </p><p>THE LAW AND INDEPENDENT THINKING.  IBRAHIM SERVED IN THE </p><p>ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE IN THE EARLY 1980S BEFORE HIS </p><p>HIGH COURT APPOINTMENT IN 1984.  JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>CHINAMASA ATTEMPTED TO STRONG-ARM HIM INTO RESIGNING IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2001 BUT INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT REPORTEDLY </p><p>CONVINCED HIM TO STAY. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA, AGE 60: ON THE BENCH SINCE </p><p>1998, HE IS THE COURT\'S MOST SENIOR BLACK MEMBER.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00038  02 OF 02  041117Z </p><p>SERVED AS A HIGH COURT JUDGE BETWEEN 1983 AND 1997, </p><p>INCLUDING AS JUDGE PRESIDENT FROM 1984.  SANDURA IS </p><p>WIDELY RESPECTED FOR HIS NON-PARTISAN READING OF THE LAW </p><p>AND IS VIEWED AS ONE OF THE TWO LAST REMAINING </p><p>INDEPENDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: COURT UNDER ZANU-PF INFLUENCE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>IN AFRICA AND ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S MOST OUTSPOKEN </p><p>WATCHDOGS IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING A RUBBER STAMP FOR </p><p>THE GOZ AND THE ZANU-PF RULING PARTY.  THE DEPARTURE OF </p><p>TWO INDEPENDENT JUSTICES PUTS MUGABE\'S RECENT -- AND </p><p>POSSIBLY MORE PLIABLE -- APPOINTMENTS IN A CLEAR </p><p>MAJORITY ON THE BENCH.  OUR SOURCES TELL US THAT CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE CHIDYAUSIKU IS LEANING ON THE JUNIOR COURT </p><p>MEMBERS (CHEDA, MALABA, ZIYAMBI) TO PRODUCE THE RESULTS </p><p>THAT MUGABE WANTS, I.E. LEGALIZATION OF LAND SEIZURES </p><p>AND THE UPHOLDING OF REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION.  AT LEAST </p><p>TWO OF THESE NEW MEMBERS WHO APPEARED TO HAVE SOLID AND </p><p>INDEPENDENT LEGAL CREDENTIALS (CHEDA AND MALABA), FELL </p><p>UNDER CHIDYAUSIKU\'S SWAY ON THE DECEMBER LAND RULING. </p><p>IF MUGABE WANTS REPLACEMENT JUSTICES (THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>STIPULATES THAT THE SUPREME COURT MUST HAVE AT LEAST </p><p>FIVE MEMBERS, BUT PROVIDES NO MAXIMUM LIMIT), HE WILL </p><p>HAVE NO TROUBLE INSTALLING REPLACEMENTS HE VIEWS AS </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO ZANU-PF\'S CAUSES, WITH CHIDYAUSIKU AT THE </p><p>HELM OF THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION.  HOWEVER, AT </p><p>THIS POINT, THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT NEED REPLACEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00038  02 OF 02  041117Z </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE TRUE TEST OF THE "NEW" </p><p>COURT\'S LEANINGS WILL COME WHEN ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO </p><p>THE GOZ\'S POLICIES INTRODUCE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO </p><p>PROPOSED REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION.  JOURNALIST GROUPS AND </p><p>THE MDC ARE ALREADY PREPARING CONSTITUTIONAL CASES </p><p>AGAINST THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION BILL AND THE PUBLIC </p><p>ORDER AND SECURITY BILL, RESPECTIVELY.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU DISMISSED THE GOVERNMENT\'S INCITEMENT TO </p><p>VIOLENCE CASE AGAINST MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, </p><p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE GAVE THE GOVERNMENT AN "OUT" BY SAYING </p><p>IT COULD CHANGE THE LAW TO LEGALLY PERMIT FUTURE ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE OPPOSITION LEADER.  EVEN IF THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT JUSTICES BELIEVE THE REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION IS </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHICH MOST LEGAL EXPERTS HERE AGREE </p><p>THAT IT IS, CHIDYAUSIKU IS LIKELY TO PRESSURE HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES INTO ISSUING EQUIVOCAL RULINGS, OR POSTPONING </p><p>THEM ALTOGETHER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
