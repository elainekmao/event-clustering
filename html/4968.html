<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, ADCO, ADPM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN FOREIGN MINISTER ON COUNTER-TERRORISM, </p><p>SCUDS, POUCHES AND PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 3853 </p><p>     B. SANAA 4024 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Summary:  The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister </p><p>Qirby on January 5 at the MFA to follow-up on the SCUDS and </p><p>pouch issues and to discuss counter-terrorism cooperation and </p><p>upcoming USG programs.  Also present were MFA advisor </p><p>al-Iryani, A/DCM and A/PolEcon Chief (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The Ambassador expressed appreciation for the ROYG\'s </p><p>practical and political response to the tragedy in Jibla last </p><p>week, including the condolences received and the ROYG\'s </p><p>efforts to galvanize public opinion to counter terror. </p><p>Recent ROYG efforts include a government report to </p><p>parliament, an unusual cabinet meeting chaired by Saleh after </p><p>the Jibla incident and a meeting of Islamic scholars (ulema) </p><p>to denounce terror (septel).  The FM agreed that mobilizing </p><p>public opinion was very important, noting that the ROYG </p><p>cannot fight terrorism without popular support and a </p><p>comprehensive approach that includes economic development and </p><p>educational reform.  Qirby said that the U.S.-ROYG </p><p>relationship should be expanded.  The Ambassador agreed with </p><p>the notion of a comprehensive approach and mentioned several </p><p>ongoing and future initiatives that the USG is undertaking in </p><p>development, including the hospital in Marib, expanded work </p><p>in Beihan and al-Jowf and the return of USAID. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The Ambassador reported to Qirby continuing acute </p><p>interest in Washington in finalizing understanding on North </p><p>Korean-Yemeni arms deals.  Given his role in managing the </p><p>crisis, the Secretary was interested in a clear understanding </p><p>that would avoid any future problem.  Ambassador then pressed </p><p>for the ROYG\'s response letter in the exchange of letters to </p><p>close the loop on the SCUDs issue (ref b).  Qirby said that </p><p>President Saleh instructed him to facilitate a meeting for </p><p>the Ambassador with the Minister of Defense to get accurate </p><p>details on any remaining shipments of parts and to formulate </p><p>the ROYG\'s response letter.  Ambassador said we would hold </p><p>that meeting soonest. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Qirby agreed to study a more detailed Embassy </p><p>request to facilitate diplomatic pouches, including "belly </p><p>loads" (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  The Ambassador briefed the FM on the special IV </p><p>program for presidential and MFA protocol officers and on the </p><p>NESA seminar being organized to assist the ROYG in developing </p><p>a national military strategy.  Qirby expressed appreciation </p><p>for both initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Qirby brought up the notion of developing mechanisms </p><p>for dialogue and said he was developing a plan to establish </p><p>working teams.  The Ambassador noted a possible visit from </p><p>A/S Burns and/or Qirby\'s next visit to Washington as good </p><p>starting points. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Comment:  Qirby\'s promotion of a meeting with the </p><p>MOD may indicate he wants an authoritative statement of </p><p>Yemen\'s arms relationship with North Korea and/or he wants </p><p>the Embassy to do the ROYG interagency coordination of this </p><p>issue.  We have already requested a meeting with the MOD to </p><p>follow up.  End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
