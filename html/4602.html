<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 005241 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, NEA/FO, H </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IZ, KU, OREP, PGOV, PREL, US </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) CODEL ISSA MEETS KUWAITI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>SPEAKER AND MEMBERS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 </p><p> (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Codel Issa met with the Speaker of Kuwait\'s </p><p>National Assembly, Mr. Jassem Al-Khorafi, and other MP\'s on </p><p>November 25, 2002. Among the topics discussed were Kuwait\'s </p><p>concerns over the U.S.-Saudi relationship, a post-Saddam Iraq </p><p>and the impact of U.S. policies in Israel and the territories </p><p>on Arab support for U.S. policy initiatives in the region. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Khorafi to Codel: You need the Saudis </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Speaker Khorafi advised Codel Issa that the Congress </p><p>should play a larger and more proactive role in "cementing" </p><p>the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.  "The </p><p>U.S. has become famous for losing friends and gaining </p><p>enemies," he said, as he urged the members of the delegation </p><p>to "please keep them as allies."  He said that Kuwait is very </p><p>concerned about the "irritants" to which Saudi Arabia had </p><p>been exposed over the past few months, and asked the Codel to </p><p>work to ensure there was no further deterioration of the </p><p>relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.  In </p><p>particular, Khorafi noted what he felt was unfair U.S. media </p><p>coverage of Saudi Arabia.  While he thanked the USG for </p><p>making a clear and public distinction between Islam and </p><p>terrorist activities, he expressed his belief that negative </p><p>media reports emanating from the U.S. were confusing Arab </p><p>perceptions and damaging the relationship between the two </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Responding to Speaker Khorafi\'s concerns, Rep. Darrell </p><p>Issa (R-CA) replied that the U.S. relationship with Saudi </p><p>Arabia was still very strong, despite media reports, and </p><p>noted that unflattering coverage was a burden societies that </p><p>enjoy a free press sometimes have to bear.  He added that he </p><p>believed the U.S. public capable of distinguishing between </p><p>fact and press speculation.  Rep. William Delahunt (D-MA) </p><p>added that the benefits of a free press outweigh the trouble </p><p>that comes along with it.  He noted that Al-Jazeera is "a </p><p>test for Arab states," which have limited experience with a </p><p>truly free press. </p><p> </p><p>Israel and Palestine </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Khorafi also used the opportunity to address Kuwaiti </p><p>concerns over U.S. policy on Israel/Palestine.  He said that </p><p>while Kuwait was eager to see peace finalized, Israel was not </p><p>committed to finding a peaceful solution.  Sharon\'s actions, </p><p>he said "will only create more extremists" and produce an </p><p>environment where the two parties "cannot sit at the table to </p><p>find a solution."  At the same time, he said, "dictators" in </p><p>the Arab world were keen on having Israel serve as a </p><p>scapegoat to ensure their continued existence.  He called </p><p>upon the U.S. to confound dictators by solving the </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While thanking the U.S. for its commitment to a </p><p>two-state solution to the conflict, Khorafi was also critical </p><p>of U.S. demands that the Palestinians elect new leadership. </p><p>He observed that Kuwait had suffered as a result of </p><p>Palestinian policies, but nonetheless the U.S. should "leave </p><p>it to them to decide" their own leadership, or face the </p><p>prospect of "embarrassing" those who support the U.S. push </p><p>for change, but do not want to be seen as "puppets of the </p><p>U.S." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Rep. Issa responded by remarking that Congress is </p><p>committed to pushing both parties towards a solution and </p><p>reminded the Speaker that President Bush explicitly supported </p><p>a Palestinian state.  Rep. Delahunt added his belief that the </p><p>solution to the Palestinian problem lay not in U.S. action, </p><p>but in increased action on the part of Arab states including </p><p>Kuwait.  He called on Kuwait to play a more active role. </p><p> </p><p>Guantanamo detainees </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Turning to the well-publicized issue of Kuwaiti </p><p>detainees at Guantanamo, Khorafi said the U.S. should give </p><p>them "every opportunity provided under international law," </p><p>decide if they are guilty or not, and then take the </p><p>appropriate action.  He added that Kuwait would stand by any </p><p>decision the USG made. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Rep. Issa explained that while the U.S. was in </p><p>uncharted waters, and taking new actions in response to new </p><p>threats, he would work with Congress in an effort to find a </p><p>sound solution as quickly as possible. </p><p> </p><p>Concern over Oil Prices </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Islamist MP Nasser al-Sane voiced his concern that </p><p>regime change in Iraq could lead to oil prices as low as five </p><p>USD per barrel.  He told Codel Issa that a British Petroleum </p><p>analyst had quoted this price in a discussion over possible </p><p>supply growth spurred by the development of Iraqi oil </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) responded by assuring al-Sane </p><p>that stable oil prices are in the economic interest of the </p><p>entire world, including the United States, whose high-cost </p><p>producers would be driven out of business by a precipitous </p><p>drop in prices.  Rep. Issa agreed, but told al-Sane that </p><p>Kuwait would have to invest in the modernization of its oil </p><p>sector if it wished to remain competitive.  The Ambassador </p><p>used this as an opportunity to stress the importance of early </p><p>passage of legislation authorizing a foreign role in the </p><p>development of Kuwait\'s Northern oil fields. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment: That Speaker Khorafi chose to lead off his </p><p>comments by focusing on Saudi Arabia reflects the extreme </p><p>importance Kuwait attaches to its relations with both the US </p><p>and Saudi Arabia, as the twin guarantors of its security. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) This cable was not cleared by Codel Issa. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p> </p><p>RJONES </p><p></p></div>
