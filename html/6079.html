<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SNAR, PHUM, GT, CACS </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL DE LEON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  In a dinner conversation February 28, De </p><p>Leon told the Ambassador that he would seek to energize </p><p>investigations of murdered American citizens and labor </p><p>leaders, to beef up his office on money laundering </p><p>investigations and said that, if invited, he would attend the </p><p>next high-level meeting on counter-narcotics cooperation with </p><p>the Ambassador.  He professes to be a big supporter of the </p><p>proposal to investigate clandestine groups, but opposes the </p><p>human rights, ombudsman,s key role in the selection of </p><p>members.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) De Leon and his wife hosted the Ambassador and Mrs. </p><p>Hamilton to dinner February 28.  This was mostly a social </p><p>occasion, but covered the following substantive topics: </p><p> </p><p>Murdered American citizens </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>3. (SBU)   The Ambassador briefed De Leon on his meeting, </p><p>February 27, with the special prosecutor assigned to American </p><p>citizen cases (septel), commenting that she and her two </p><p>assistants seemed sincere and well-intentioned, but </p><p>over-whelmed by the difficulty of the cases (to which she was </p><p>assigned after initial investigations were bungled or </p><p>non-existent).  Would it be possible to take her out of the </p><p>normal duty rotation, in order to lighten her caseload?  De </p><p>Leon avoided saying yes, but did agree to another suggestion, </p><p>that he meet with her to review progress in the cases every </p><p>month or two.  The Ambassador said he would continue to meet </p><p>with her every two months, noting that progress in these </p><p>cases is a high priority for us and that they could figure </p><p>prominently in Congressional debates on CAFTA approval and </p><p>the like. </p><p> </p><p>Labor rights </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4. (SBU)  The Ambassador briefed De Leon on the AFL-CIO GSP </p><p>petition, telling him that unresolved cases of threats and </p><p>violence against labor leaders figure centrally in the </p><p>petition.  To date, none of the cases of the last two years </p><p>has been resolved.  Could he take an interest in these cases </p><p>and seek to energize the prosecutors handling them?  De Leon </p><p>said he would. </p><p> </p><p>Clandestine Group Investigation Proposal </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>5. (SBU)  De Leon professed to be a strong supporter of the </p><p>need to investigate and prosecute clandestine groups but, </p><p>toward the end of the evening, returned to this topic to say </p><p>he opposed having the Human Rights Ombudsman produce the </p><p>slate of names for three members (as proposed by Human Rights </p><p>Watch official Jose Miguel Vivanco).  De Leon was so adamant </p><p>about this seemingly innocuous feature of the proposal that </p><p>it belied his claim to favor it. </p><p> </p><p>Counter-narcotics meeting </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU)  The Ambassador tweaked De Leon for pledging </p><p>personally to attend the February 21 high-level meeting on </p><p>drug cooperation only not to be represented at all.  Looking </p><p>sheepish, De Leon said he had meant to come but got tied up </p><p>in the teachers, strike and that, in any event, the public </p><p>ministry had not been invited this time.  The Ambassador said </p><p>we would check with the foreign ministry about participation. </p><p> </p><p>Money laundering investigations </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU)  The Ambassador told De Leon frankly that his office </p><p>on money laundering investigations is seriously understaffed, </p><p>that the financial analysis unit in the tax superintendency </p><p>is raring to go but has a weak partner in the public </p><p>ministry.  De Leon acknowledged the point and promised to </p><p>beef up the office significantly, when he gets a total of 150 </p><p>new auxiliary prosecutors in about another month. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In an unsolicited comment, De Leon gave our visa </p><p>revocation of Attorney Fernando Linares a big thumbs up. </p><p> </p><p>Bio note </p><p>----------- </p><p>9. (SBU)  De Leon,s wife, Maria del Maria Carpio Nicole, is </p><p>the daughter of former vice president Roberto Carpio Nicole </p><p>(1985-1990) and the niece of politician and newspaper editor </p><p>Jorge Carpio Nicole, who was assassinated in 1993.  Her first </p><p>cousin, Jorge Carpio,s son, was married to Karen Fischer, De </p><p>Leon,s special prosecutor on corruption.  The De Leon,s </p><p>have a 15-year-old daughter, Michelle, who lives with Mrs. De </p><p>Leon\'s sister and two cousins in Boston, attending high </p><p>school there, out of the De Leons, concern that his job puts </p><p>her security at risk in Guatemala.  The De Leons spent a year </p><p>at the Kennedy School at Harvard in the late 1980s; he was a </p><p>classmate of Jose Maria Figueres, who was subsequently </p><p>(1994-1998) President of Costa Rica.  The  De Leon\'s live in </p><p>a modest home 15 kilometers outside Guatemala City. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
