<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002664 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THOMAS BARLOW, DOC, CODE 4121 </p><p>STATE, EB/IFD/OIA-MARTHA KELLEY AND KATHRYN STEVENS, AND </p><p>L/LEI-TOM HEINEMANN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PGOV, BR, AR, SI, CI, BU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH IMPLEMENTATION OF OECD BRIBERY CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 79413 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  The GOT Parliament ratified the OECD Bribery </p><p>Convention in 2000, but did not ratify the implementing </p><p>legislation until January 2, 2003.  This makes Turkey the </p><p>last of the 35 signatories to the Convention to ratify laws </p><p>that make it a crime to bribe foreign officials in </p><p>international business transactions.  In line with the </p><p>provisions of the Convention, Parliament has amended the </p><p>Turkish penal code and expanded the scope of laws that </p><p>previously dealt with bribery of domestic officials. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Enforcement of Convention </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) GOT officials claim that there has not been enough </p><p>time to assess enforcement of the law (see below for </p><p>specifics of new law), as this law has yet to apply to any </p><p>cases at the prosecution stage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The GOT\'s resources for enforcement include the </p><p>Justice Ministry, which has responsibility for investigating </p><p>and prosecuting bribery cases (Justice will work with MASAK </p><p>in cases of bribery of foreign officials - see below).  The </p><p>Turkish National Police (TNP) and Jandarma, which both fall </p><p>under the Interior Ministry, investigate bribery cases under </p><p>the guidance of prosecutors in the Ministry of Justice.  In </p><p>addition, the Prime Ministry Inspection Board (PMIB) </p><p>investigates domestic corruption cases, and is currently </p><p>advising a new Parliamentary committee.  Bulent Tarhan, of </p><p>the  PMIB, is one of several experts who are advising the </p><p>recently established Corruption Investigations Committee, </p><p>which has two primary functions:  investigating corruption </p><p>cases through public hearings and also studying the </p><p>underlying reasons behind corruption, based on analysis of </p><p>PMIB and other authorities\' investigations over the past five </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Implementing Legislation </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Law number 4782, passed January 2, 2003, effectively </p><p>ratified the necessary implementation required of the GOT </p><p>under the OECD Bribery Convention, which the GOT became party </p><p>to in 2000.  This law provides several amendments/additions </p><p>to the Turkish Penal Code.  Specifically, amendments were </p><p>made to the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering, the Law on </p><p>Controlling Narcotics Substances, the Civil Service Law and </p><p>the decree with the force of law on the Organizational </p><p>Structure and Duties of the Finance Ministry.  The following </p><p>amendments/additions were made: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-There is a bribery case if there is an attempt or a </p><p>commitment to provide benefits to the individuals appointed </p><p>as legislative, administrative or judicial government </p><p>authorities in a foreign country or to officials conducting </p><p>international duties in a host country to provide certain </p><p>services or to prevent provision of services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-If the representatives of a corporate body are involved in </p><p>bribery, both the representatives and the corporate body </p><p>itself will be required to pay a cash penalty, as high as two </p><p>to threefold of the benefit received.  Individuals repeatedly </p><p>conducting anti-bribery crimes will be discharged from their </p><p>duties and cannot work as GOT contractors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-The GOT can file a new bribery lawsuit against an individual </p><p>upon the Justice Ministry\'s order, even if there is an </p><p>existing court verdict regarding bribery of this individual </p><p>in a foreign country.  The GOT will not file a new lawsuit </p><p>against an individual if there is a former verdict regarding </p><p>this person\'s involvement in crimes related to counterfeiting </p><p>foreign currency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-With the amendment to the Law on Prevention of Money </p><p>Laundering, bribery of foreign officials in host country or </p><p>bribery of foreign officials in a foreign country were </p><p>defined as predicate offenses for money laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) These amendments expand the authority of MASAK </p><p>(Financial Crimes Investigation Board), the GOT\'s financial </p><p>intelligence unit (FIU) that has primary responsibility for </p><p>crimes associated with money laundering.  "This legislation </p><p>gives the ability to create the necessary framework for </p><p>cooperation between FIUs for all cooperation more broadly," </p><p>said Oya Karakas, of MFA\'s General Directorate of </p><p>Multilateral Economic Affairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Promoting Public Awareness </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The GOT has yet to promote public awareness of the new </p><p>legislation, although plans are in the works.  Karakas said </p><p>the MFA plans to set up an international workshop of OECD </p><p>members, and representatives from Central Asian countries, to </p><p>promote anti-corruption measures that have been taken. </p><p>Karakas said a date has not been set yet, but the location </p><p>will be the OECD Regional Center in Istanbul.  In addition, </p><p>Karakas says the MFA plans to take advantage of a library </p><p>that is physically located between and shared by the OECD </p><p>Regional Center and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.  She </p><p>said the OECD is working to establish an e-library that can </p><p>be used for research of anti-corruption activities undertaken </p><p>by OECD members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Related Anti-Corruption Activities </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) Representatives from local NGOs had little comment on </p><p>the GOT measures related to the new law.  However, </p><p>representatives from the Turkish chapter of Transparency </p><p>International remain concerned about GOT attempts to amend </p><p>the Public Procurement Law, which established a board to </p><p>oversee public tenders (an important condition in the </p><p>IMF-supported reform program).  Earlier this year, the GOT </p><p>proposed two articles to a new draft law designed to revise </p><p>the tax forgiveness law, and give substantial savings to </p><p>companies close to the new government.  This GOT effort has </p><p>been defeated, at least for the time being, by pressure from </p><p>the IMF, World Bank, USG, and NGOs such as Transparency </p><p>International. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
