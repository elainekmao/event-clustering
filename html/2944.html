<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ASEC, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC LEADER TSVANGIRAI ON THE WAY FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1136 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai told us his </p><p>party is pursuing a four-pronged strategy in the election </p><p>aftermath: participating in the (now stalled) inter-party </p><p>dialogue; challenging the election result in court; </p><p>organizing mass action; and encouraging increased </p><p>international pressure on the Mugabe regime.  President </p><p>Obasanjo reportedly told the MDC the talks would continue </p><p>despite ZANU-PF\'s request for a suspension, even if he had to </p><p>travel to Harare personally.  Tsvangirai is skeptical the </p><p>court case will result in overturning the election result, </p><p>but will expose the fraudulent tactics the ruling party </p><p>employed to win.  The party\'s supporters are waiting for </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s word to proceed with strikes and peaceful </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>demonstrations, but the MDC leader wants to ensure the timing </p><p>is right before giving such an instruction.  Tsvangirai </p><p>acknowledged that some radical elements have encouraged the </p><p>party to engage in violent resistance, but he claims to have </p><p>discouraged them and appears genuinely committed to peaceful </p><p>change.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Inter-party talks </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a May 14 breakfast with MDC leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai, the Ambassador, joined by polchief, asked about </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the opposition\'s thinking on the way forward.  Tsvangirai </p><p>replied that the MDC is pursuing a four-pronged strategy </p><p>focused on increasing the pressure on President Mugabe and </p><p>ZANU-PF.  The first element is the (stalled) inter-party </p><p>dialogue.  Tsvangirai expressed his belief that Mugabe had </p><p>instructed his negotiating team to pull back because he </p><p>feared he would not be able to control where the talks led. </p><p>He reported that Nigerian President Obasanjo had told MDC </p><p>Vice-President Gibson Sibanda several days before in Abuja </p><p>that the talks would go on even if Obasanjo had to travel </p><p>personally to Harare to make that happen.  Although the </p><p>facilitators are trying to convince ZANU-PF to reverse its </p><p>position, the MDC, he said, is now operating on the </p><p>assumption that the talks will not resume.  To reengage, the </p><p>MDC would have to be convinced that the ruling party was </p><p>sincere about making progress, and did not insist on </p><p>precondictions for dialogue.  "Look," Tsvangirai stressed, </p><p>"I\'ve come under significant pressure for participating in </p><p>these talks at all," given the serious doubts about Mugabe\'s </p><p>legitimacy.  "Many of our supporters are afraid we\'re going </p><p>to get hoodwinked."  (Comment:  later on May 14, the Nigerian </p><p>High Commissioner told us the facilitators are actively </p><p>pressing for resumption of the talks and were scheduled to </p><p>meet with President Mugabe at noon.  They were strung along </p><p>by the ruling party side without a definitive answer most of </p><p>May 13.) </p><p> </p><p>Legal challenge </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The second element of the MDC\'s post-election </p><p>strategy is the recently-filed court challenge of the </p><p>election results.  ZANU-PF, he said, seems at a loss as to </p><p>how to respond.  He is dubious that the election result will </p><p>be overturned, asking "who would have the courage to deliver </p><p>such a ruling?"  The real value of the legal case, however, </p><p>is that it provides a public forum for the exposure of the </p><p>ruling party\'s electoral tactics. </p><p> </p><p>Mass action </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ultimately, Tsvangirai thought peaceful mass action </p><p>in the form of strikes and demonstrations might be the most </p><p>effective course of action.  He noted that he has been </p><p>holding well-attended rallies around the country, where the </p><p>crowds have pressed hard for the party to "do something" to </p><p>stanch the continued political and economic decline.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked whether the MDC would lead such an effort, </p><p>or whether it would be more appropriate or effective for an </p><p>organization such as the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions </p><p>(ZCTU) to be in the forefront.  The MDC is the appropriate </p><p>actor, he replied, as the Zimbabwean crisis is caused by </p><p>broad political and economic issues and is not, at its core, </p><p>a labor problem.  People around the country are waiting for </p><p>his word to launch mass action, Tsvangirai said, but he wants </p><p>to ensure the timing is right.  Asked whether such action </p><p>could be imminent, the MDC leader replied in the affirmative. </p><p> (Note:  Tsvangirai\'s special advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, told </p><p>us several days earlier that mass action could begin as early </p><p>as late May.  End Note.) </p><p>International pressure </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Continued international pressure on the Mugabe regime </p><p>is crucial to a positive resolution of the crisis here, </p><p>Tsvangirai insisted.  Targeted sanctions were helpful, and he </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>urged that those measures currently in place be broadened and </p><p>toughened.  The degree of international attention on Zimbabwe </p><p>would also be an important factor in the timing of mass </p><p>action.  Tsvangirai said he wanted to avoid giving the </p><p>instruction to proceed if the international community was, at </p><p>that moment, consumed by major developments or crises in </p><p>another part of the world. </p><p> </p><p>Paramilitary planning </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador told Tsvangirai that some people -- </p><p>most of them outside the MDC\'s formal party structure -- </p><p>have, in recent conversations with us, advocated an </p><p>unconventional paramilitary campaign against the government. </p><p>Such an approach, he warned, could give the government the </p><p>excuse it has long sought to crush the MDC.  It would also </p><p>have little prospect of success, since the instruments of </p><p>force are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of the </p><p>ruling party.  The Ambassador said we had strongly </p><p>discouraged these interlocutors from engaging in such </p><p>activity and he hoped that Tsvangirai would do the same if </p><p>approached.  The MDC leader replied that every party contains </p><p>radical elements, and he acknowledged that some had urged him </p><p>to pursue the road of violent resistance.  He said that some </p><p>ex-Rhodesians who wanted the MDC to adopt their violent ideas </p><p>were also being turned aside.  Tsvangirai agreed that such an </p><p>approach could have disastrous consequences and, despite </p><p>criticism from some quarters that he is a weak leader, </p><p>continues to believe in and press for peaceful change. </p><p> </p><p>Less violence, but more discrimination in food distribution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Tsvangirai believed that violence against MDC </p><p>supporters in rural areas has begun to ease.  His primary </p><p>worry in rural areas is the political manipulation of food, </p><p>particularly that MDC supporters are being denied access to </p><p>scarce food supplies controlled by the government\'s Grain </p><p>Marketing Board. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Tsvangirai did not seem disappointed by ZANU-PF\'s </p><p>reluctance to continue with the inter-party dialogue.  He had </p><p>low expectations anyway, and ZANU-PF\'s apparent intransigence </p><p>can only help the MDC\'s diplomatic efforts to ramp up the </p><p>pressure on the Mugabe regime.  However, if the facilitators </p><p>convince the ruling party to come back to the table, the MDC </p><p>will feel immense pressure to follow suit, notwithstanding </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s rejection of preconditions.  The opposition </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>party has been working actively with its structures around </p><p>the country to organize mass action, but it is not clear to </p><p>us how successful those efforts have been.  MDC rallies have </p><p>had good turnouts for a non-election period.  We believe </p><p>Tsvangirai remains convinced for now that peaceful resistance </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>is the best way to effect positive change and we will </p><p>continue to strongly counsel him in this direction. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
