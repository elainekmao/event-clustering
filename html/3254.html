<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001314 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, NP, IN, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIA VISIT EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, NEPAL\'S KING </p><p>SAYS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1216 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  King Gyanendra\'s week-long visit to India in </p><p>late June "exceeded his expectations," a businessman close to </p><p>Nepal\'s monarch told the Ambassador July 3.  In New Delhi the </p><p>King received assurances of Indian support conditioned on the </p><p>maintenance of Nepal\'s constitutional monarchy and </p><p>multi-party system.  Gyanendra pledged to protect both, and </p><p>adduced his assent to the Nepali Prime Minister\'s request to </p><p>dissolve Parliament as evidence of his commitment to the </p><p>constitutional system.  The King reportedly pressed Home </p><p>Minister Advani to take more decisive action against Maoists </p><p>operating in India and to share information on terrorists </p><p>reportedly operating in Nepal.  Third-country security </p><p>assistance to Nepal was not an issue in the King\'s meetings, </p><p>and in fact Defense Minister Fernandes extended an offer to </p><p>help fill gaps in foreign assistance.  Our interlocutor also </p><p>reviewed meetings with opposition leader Sonia Gandhi and </p><p>former PM Chandrasekhar.  The King travels to China July </p><p>9-15.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>India Trip Exceeds Monarch\'s Expectations </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nepal\'s King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah reported that </p><p>his June 23-28 visit to India "exceeded his expectations in </p><p>virtually all respects," a Nepali businessman with extremely </p><p>close ties to the monarch told Ambassador and DCM July 3. </p><p>Prabhakar Rana (strongly protect) said the King had asked him </p><p>the night before to relate to the Ambassador his assessment </p><p>of his trip to India, his first foriegn visit since his </p><p>accession to the throne in June 2001.  Echoing a Royal Palace </p><p>press notice issued just before the King\'s departure for New </p><p>Delhi, Rana labeled the themes of the visit as "continuation" </p><p>and "consolidation" (Reftel).  The King felt press coverage </p><p>of the trip had been "generally good," Rana added. </p><p> </p><p>India Conditions Support on Continuation of Democracy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In India the King used every opportunity to brief his </p><p>interlocutors on both the security situation in Nepal and </p><p>what Rana termed "the big political mess in Kathmandu."  The </p><p>Indians--including PM Vajpayee--made it clear that India </p><p>would support any and all measures to deal with the </p><p>insurgency as long as two elements remained:  the </p><p>constitutional monarchy and a multi-party system.  Gyanendra </p><p>replied that both he and his late brother King Birendra saw </p><p>themselves as protectors of the constitutional system, and he </p><p>offered assurances that the multi-party system was here to </p><p>stay. </p><p> </p><p>King Commits to Constitutional Role </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PM Vajpayee reportedly asked the King during their </p><p>private meeting why he had agreed to Nepal\'s Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba\'s request to dissolve Parliament.  Gyanendra replied </p><p>that his role as constitutional monarch gave him no choice </p><p>but to go along.  The only alternative would be to change </p><p>Nepal\'s political system.  Rana did not know whether in India </p><p>the King had addressed the possibility of his having to </p><p>intervene politically should elections fail to take place in </p><p>November, sparking a constitutional crisis.  (Note:  The DCM </p><p>related to Rana the concerns of some Nepali politicians that </p><p>if elections failed to take place and the King had to step </p><p>in, forces in the palace would press for scrapping the </p><p>multi-party system and restoring a Panchayat-style regime </p><p>like that which ruled Nepal during 1960-1990.  Rana admitted </p><p>that some in the palace might hold such views, but insisted </p><p>that those individuals do not have political standing.  He </p><p>was categorical that there was no possibility of abrogating </p><p>the party system and going back to something else.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Vajpayee had agreed that Nepal\'s palace would maintain </p><p>close relations with the PM\'s office in New Delhi, and </p><p>expressed no opposition to the King also developing direct </p><p>relations with the Indian Home Minister. </p><p> </p><p>King Presses Home Minister Advani </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a meeting with Home Minister Advani, the King </p><p>reiterated that Nepal was committed to opposing terrorists of </p><p>any stripe, Rana told us.  The King had been firm with </p><p>Advani, telling him that India\'s policy on Nepal\'s Maoists </p><p>would have to change, implicitly to one more forthright and </p><p>decisive.  The King also asked Advani why he had not </p><p>consulted with the GON before making public statements </p><p>claiming Islamic militant groups were operating in Nepal. </p><p>When the King asked whether India had passed information </p><p>about the groups to Kathmandu, Advani replied that thought so </p><p>but would check.  The King added that if India provides solid </p><p>information about such activity, Nepal would take action. </p><p>Advani expressed his agreement to maintaining direct links </p><p>between his ministry and Nepal\'s Royal Palace. </p><p> </p><p>Third-Country Security Aid to Nepal Not at Issue </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Rana was not aware of India expressing concerns to the </p><p>King about U.S. or other outside security assistance coming </p><p>into Nepal.  He knew of only one occasion when the recent </p><p>London meeting on aid to Nepal was mentioned:  the King\'s </p><p>meeting with Defense Minister Fernandes.  Fernandes had not </p><p>expressed concern about third-country military assistance. </p><p>On the contrary, he offered that India stood ready to fill </p><p>gaps in needed security assistance to Nepal, including </p><p>short-term shortfalls.  The King and Fernandes had discussed </p><p>Nepal\'s specific defense needs in some detail, Rana said. </p><p>(Note:  Rana indicated that in New Delhi the King had been </p><p>briefed on the London conference by Ministry of External </p><p>Affairs (MEA) Joint Secretary Meera Shankar.  Her briefing </p><p>jibed with the one Rana heard from the British Charge in </p><p>Kathmandu who had attended the meeting in London, Rana said. </p><p>This was evidence, in Rana\'s view, that the MEA was being </p><p>more open and cooperative with the GON than it had been in </p><p>the past.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with Opposition Leader </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi stuck to personal </p><p>matters in her meeting on Nepal\'s King, leaving substantive </p><p>issues to her economic advisor and former Finance Minister </p><p>Manmohan Singh.  (Note:  Manmohan Singh\'s appearance </p><p>surprised the Nepalis, who had expected Gandhi\'s political </p><p>advisor, Natwar Singh, to join her as their substantive </p><p>interlocutor.  End Note.)  The King briefed the Congress </p><p>Party leader on the security and domestic political </p><p>situations in Nepal.  Gandhi agreed that the King would keep </p><p>up direct contact with the party through Manmohan Singh. </p><p> </p><p>Chandrasekhar </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Former PM Chandrasekhar--who has close ties to Nepal\'s </p><p>former PM Girija Prasad Koirala--paid a call on King </p><p>Gyanendra in New Delhi.  The King anticipated that the </p><p>leftish former PM would criticize the continued campaign </p><p>against the Maoists, so he preempted the line of questioning </p><p>by first asking how India could allow the Nepali Congress </p><p>Party (NCP) to split.  Chandrasekhar replied that he no </p><p>longer has the influence with the NCP that he once had.  The </p><p>King pressed Chandrasekhar for help in marshalling assistance </p><p>to counter Nepal\'s Maoists insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>Next Stop: China </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) King Gyanendra, who departs for China for a six-day </p><p>state visit July 9, said he expected his trip there to be </p><p>less problematic than his India visit.  The King had </p><p>considered the trip to India "riskier" because of the </p><p>possibility of domestic criticism, as many Nepalis harbor </p><p>deep suspicions about their southern neighbor. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
