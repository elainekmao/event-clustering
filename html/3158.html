<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 001780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PPC, WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 06/17/22 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  CERRO LA MOLE RADAR--THE UNREQUITED PACT </p><p> </p><p>Classified by PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  In 1993, the U.S. entered into an </p><p>agreement with GOH regarding the maintenance of the radar </p><p>located at Cerro La Mole.  The U.S. agreed to pay 75% of </p><p>all maintenance costs up to a limit of $400,000 per year, </p><p>while the GOH agreed to pay 25% of the maintenance costs, </p><p>in addition to the manpower needed to maintain the radar. </p><p>To date, the U.S. has paid nothing under the agreement, </p><p>while the GOH has paid for all maintenance costs of the </p><p>equipment.  U.S. noncompliance with the agreement </p><p>increasingly is becoming an issue in bilateral relations </p><p>between the U.S. military and the Honduran Armed Forces </p><p>(HOAF).  The radar equipment is part of an integrated </p><p>counterdrug radar architecture in the region, and post </p><p>seeks guidance on how to resolve the unsettled issue of </p><p>the U.S.\'s obligations under the agreement. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE AGREEMENT ITSELF </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In 1993 the U.S. and GOH signed a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding between the Government of the Republic of </p><p>Honduras and the Government of the United States of </p><p>America for the Expansion of the Radar Located in Cerro </p><p>La Mole in the Caribbean Basin Radar Network (MOU).  The </p><p>purpose of the MOU was to reaffirm the cooperation of the </p><p>two governments in the international battle against </p><p>narcotics trafficking by expanding the radar capability </p><p>of the region as set forth in the Caribbean Basin Radar </p><p>Network agreement (CBRN) signed by the U.S. and the GOH </p><p>April 7, 1989.  The MOU was designed to integrate the </p><p>Cerro La Mole radar (hereinafter referred to as "the </p><p>radar") into the operations of the CBRN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The core provisions of the MOU are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-The radar is owned and operated by the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>-The costs of operation and maintenance of the radar are </p><p>to be borne by the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. will have unrestricted access to the data from </p><p>the radar except in the case of a Honduran national </p><p>emergency (GOH will notify the U.S. in such instance). </p><p>Likewise, the U.S. will provide the HOAF access to data </p><p>from the U.S. owned radar on Calentura Hill. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. and the GOH will develop a joint operations </p><p>plan for the operation of the radar. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. will provide spare parts support and technical </p><p>assistance valued at a maximum of $400,000 per year, with </p><p>the GOH responsible for no less than 25 percent of the </p><p>total spare parts/technical assistance costs each year. </p><p> </p><p>-Materials, equipment and services imported into Honduras </p><p>by the U.S. in connection with the operation and </p><p>maintenance of the radars are duty-free and exempt from </p><p>taxes. </p><p> </p><p>-The GOH will provide land for installation of </p><p>communication equipment needed to operate the radars. </p><p> </p><p>-The GOH has an option to purchase the U.S. installed </p><p>equipment at a price set by the parties pursuant to the </p><p>U.S. Foreign Military Sales Procedures during the </p><p>effective dates of the agreement. </p><p> </p><p>-The financial obligations of the parties under the MOU </p><p>are subject to the availability of authorized and </p><p>appropriated funds of the parties. </p><p> </p><p>-The MOU is effective from the date the parties exchanged </p><p>notes indicating that their respective constitutional </p><p>requirements have been met and remains in force until </p><p>April 7, 2009. </p><p> </p><p>-The MOU may be extended by written agreement of the </p><p>parties, and may be terminated at any time by either </p><p>party upon one-year written notice to the other party. </p><p>Within the one-year period preceding the termination of </p><p>the MOU, the U.S. may remove any U.S. installed equipment </p><p>that the GOH has not purchased. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE DIPLOMACY PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The U.S. has not paid any of the maintenance </p><p>costs for the radar, as required in the MOU.  Simply </p><p>stated, this is a source of tension between the HOAF </p><p>and the U.S. military personnel working in Honduras. </p><p>Additionally, it creates a diplomatic uncertainty for the </p><p>U.S. mission and the GOH.  The resulting discomfort stems </p><p>from a variety of sources. </p><p>-Presumably the MOU is a legally binding contract entered </p><p>into by two sovereign nations.  The U.S. has a </p><p>responsibility to abide by its terms. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. military conducts a significant number of </p><p>engagement activities with the HOAF in Honduras. </p><p>Relations between the two militaries are adversely </p><p>affected by the fact that the U.S. has not performed </p><p>under the MOU. </p><p> </p><p>-It is difficult to enforce proper end use of U.S. </p><p>training and equipment when HOAF officials repeatedly </p><p>point to the U.S.\'s failure to abide by a properly </p><p>executed MOU. </p><p> </p><p>-The MOU issue is repeatedly raised by the HOAF and, </p><p>therefore, takes up an inordinate amount of time and </p><p>manpower. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE DRUG WAR PROBLEM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) More and more frequently, Honduran waters are </p><p>used by narcotraffickers for transshipment of drugs from </p><p>Columbia to the U.S.  The U.S. regularly asks the GOH to </p><p>assist in the drug war.  The radar at Cerro La Mole is a </p><p>part of an integrated counterdrug radar architecture in </p><p>the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.  According to U.S. </p><p>military officials here in Honduras, there is essentially </p><p>a "hole" in the U.S. radar capability in the Western </p><p>Hemisphere.  The Cerro La Mole radar would, if </p><p>functional, fill that void and foster counterdrug efforts </p><p>in the region.  In this sense, the radar could serve a </p><p>useful purpose in support of U.S. interests in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The funding for payment of the U.S. obligation </p><p>to provide 75% of the radar maintenance cost apparently </p><p>exists--at least in theory.  $400,000 is budgeted each </p><p>fiscal year and routed to Air Combat Command.  However, </p><p>it is apparently unlawful to utilize these funds for the </p><p>maintenance of the radar for two reasons.  First of all, </p><p>counterdrug money cannot fund recurring maintenance costs </p><p>of equipment not owned by the U.S.  Secondly, Air Combat </p><p>Command is prohibited from paying recurring maintenance </p><p>costs of assets that do not belong to the U.S.  As a </p><p>result, the $400,000 is turned back unused each year. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Post seeks guidance as to the appropriate </p><p>resolution of this ongoing issue.  There are several </p><p>potential solutions: </p><p> </p><p>-Keep the pact in place and take the steps necessary to </p><p>make the funding available for its intended purpose-- </p><p>thereby honoring the original bargain.  It is difficult </p><p>to predict the cost of this option, but it is safe to say </p><p>that the GOH has not spent anything close to the amount </p><p>that would require the U.S. to pay $400,000 per year for </p><p>the relevant MOU time frame. </p><p> </p><p>-Negotiate a lump-sum buy-out of the U.S. obligation </p><p>under the MOU.  This might cost anywhere between $400,000 </p><p>and $3.6 million, according to our military sources. </p><p> </p><p>-Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, notify the GOH of the </p><p>U.S.\'s intention to terminate the MOU--then follow </p><p>through. </p><p> </p><p>-Take the official position that, due to the funding </p><p>predicament, Article IX of the MOU eliminates the U.S.\'s </p><p>responsibility for maintenance costs under the MOU. </p><p>Taking this stance, one must argue that U.S. financial </p><p>obligations have always been legally non-existent. </p><p> </p><p>-Enter into negotiations with the GOH in order to </p><p>extricate the U.S. from the MOU.  Post\'s recommendation </p><p>briefly described below is one way of accomplishing this </p><p>option. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POST\'S RECOMMENDATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Post maintains that it is in the best interest </p><p>of the U.S. to amicably resolve the U.S. obligations </p><p>pursuant to the MOU.  Post recommends that we negotiate </p><p>an end to the MOU, while at the same time ensuring that </p><p>both U.S. and Honduran interests are addressed.  One </p><p>possible solution is to offer to GOH the opportunity to </p><p>participate in the Cooperating Nations Intelligence </p><p>Exchange System (CNIES).  CNIES is a system based in Key </p><p>West and operated by the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force </p><p>East (JIATFE).  It provides images of portions of the </p><p>Western Hemisphere.  CNIES is a system in which the GOH </p><p>is very interested, and post believes that if it were </p><p>possible to provide the GOH access to CNIES, the GOH </p><p>might well agree to relinquish any claims against the </p><p>U.S. under the MOU.  This option would solve the U.S.\'s </p><p>dilemma with respect to the MOU, and at the same time </p><p>would provide beneficial information (particularly in </p><p>terms of counter-drug efforts) to the GOH.  Additionally, </p><p>it is noteworthy that this option would cost the U.S. </p><p>virtually nothing. </p><p> </p><p>ALMAGUER </p><p></p></div>
