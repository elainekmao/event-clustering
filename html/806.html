<p>UNCLAS RIYADH 005382 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  1995 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 245276 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEYED TO POINTS IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A.  (U)  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 13 BOMBING OF THE </p><p>RIYADH HEADQUARTERS OF THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, </p><p>SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD (OPM/SANG), WHICH KILLED SEVEN </p><p>PERSONS, INCLUDING FIVE AMERICANS, AND INJURED MORE THAN FORTY </p><p>OTHERS, THE SAG LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION IN FULL </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE USG.  THIS INCLUDED PROVIDING COMPLETE </p><p>SUPPORT TO AN FBI INVESTIGATION TEAM.  INCREASED SECURITY </p><p>MEASURES FOR AMERICAN FACILITIES WERE INSTITUTED UNDER THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF SENIOR SAUDI LEADERS, AND THE TWO GOVERNMENTS </p><p>ENTERED INTO A DEEPER DIALOGUE ON COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES IN </p><p>GENERAL.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES APACE.  THERE WERE NO </p><p>OTHER ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM, BY DEPARTMENT OF STATE DEFINITION, IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA THIS YEAR, AND NO CASES ARE PENDING FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (U)  THE SAG WAS NOT FORTHCOMING WHEN THE USG, ACTING ON A </p><p>TIP FROM AN INFORMANT, REQUESTED SAUDI ASSISTANCE IN DETAINING </p><p>A TERRORIST IDENTIFIED IN PRESS REPORTS AS HIZBALLAH SPECIAL </p><p>SECURITY CHIEF IMAD MUGHNIYAH.  THE LATTER WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>SCHEDULED TO MAKE A STOPOVER APRIL 7 IN JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>EN ROUTE FROM KHARTOUM TO BEIRUT.  THE USG REQUESTED THAT THE </p><p>SAUDIS ARREST MUGHNIYAH UPON ARRIVAL IN JEDDAH AND TURN HIM </p><p>OVER TO OFFICIALS FOR TRANSPORT TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND </p><p>TRIAL FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE HIJACKING OF TWA FLIGHT 847 IN </p><p>1985.  THE SAG REFUSED THE PLANE PERMISSION TO LAND IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (U)  THERE ARE NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS TO SAG </p><p>PROSECUTION OF PERSONS COMMITTING TERRORIST ACTS WITHIN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA.  NO FORMAL EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST BETWEEN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>D.  (U)  SAUDI LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL--INCLUDING KING FAHD, </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, AND CABINET MINISTERS--ISSUED FORCEFUL </p><p>STATEMENTS CONDEMNING THE NOVEMBER 13 OPM/SANG BOMBING AND ITS </p><p>PERPETRATORS.  OFFICIAL MEDIA CARRIED EXTENSIVE REPORTS OF </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACK ON U.S. FACILITIES ISSUED BY PUBLIC, </p><p>RELIGIOUS, AND PRIVATE GROUPS.  THE MEDIA WERE SIMILARLY </p><p>DEPLOYED TO PUBLICIZE SAG COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING AND TO APPEAL FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE </p><p>IN IDENTIFYING THE PERPETRATORS. </p><p> </p><p>--  IN JULY, THE SAG RELEASED A PUBLIC STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE </p><p>KIDNAPPINGS OF THE FIVE WESTERNERS IN KASHMIR AS COUNTER TO THE </p><p>TENETS OF ISLAM AND CALLED FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>HOSTAGES, AS DID SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADERS UPON THE URGING </p><p>OF THE SAG.  IN NOVEMBER, THE SAG JOINED IN CONDEMNING THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF YITZHAK RABIN AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>E.  (U)  THE SAG UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORUMS IN 1995.  HOWEVER, THE SAG DID CONDUCT A </p><p>MAJOR INVESTIGATION OF THE OPM/SANG BOMBING AND PROVIDED </p><p>OUTSTANDING SUPPORT TO THE USG\'S OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>F.  (U)  THE SAG OFFICIALLY DENIES IT FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS OR ACTIVITIES, AND SINCE APRIL </p><p>1993 SAUDI REGULATIONS HAVE REQUIRED NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES COLLECTING </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES TO OBTAIN </p><p>FORMAL SAG AUTHORIZATION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE UNCONFIRMED </p><p>REPORTS OF FINANCIAL TIES BETWEEN TERRORIST GROUPS AND SOME </p><p>PRIVATE SAUDI-BASED NGOS. </p><p> </p><p>G.  (U)  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ON THE USG\'S SO-CALLED </p><p>"TERRORISM LIST" ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  ON APRIL 20, THE SAG </p><p>ALLOWED A LIBYAN AIRLINES JET CARRYING LIBYAN HAJJ PILGRIMS TO </p><p>LAND AT JEDDAH\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BE SERVICED, AND DEPART </p><p>IN VIOLATION OF UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO </p><p>THE FLIGHT, MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAIF HAD COMMENTED </p><p>PUBLICLY THAT ALL PILGRIMS WITH VALID HAJJ VISAS WOULD BE </p><p>RECEIVED BY SAUDI ARABIA, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>H.  (U)  THE UNSOLVED NOVEMBER 13 BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH HAS GREATLY HEIGHTENED SAG CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT </p><p>ALSO DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FOREIGN-SPONSORED </p><p>INCIDENTS, INCLUDING DURING HAJJ.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, </p><p>THERE MAY ALSO EXIST OFFICIAL CONCERN THAT THE WAR IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN ATTRACTED SAUDI AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED </p><p>TRAINING IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES AND OTHER WEAPONS.  SUCH </p><p>INDIVIDUALS MAY NOW ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD AND ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
