<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002612 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL DAS CARPENTER AND EAP DAS DALEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/12 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PINS, PREL, SOCI, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 2345 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02612  01 OF 02  300231Z </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  THE NOVEMBER 8 HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>VIETNAM WILL BE ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR EFFORTS </p><p>TO DEEPEN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND TO REITERATE </p><p>THE GENUINE CONCERN FELT IN THE U.S. -- WITHIN THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS, AND THE PUBLIC -- ABOUT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ABUSES AND SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>EMBASSY APPRECIATES THE ONGOING PREPARATION BY DRL AND </p><p>EAP AND WELCOMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>OFFICER TIM SWANSON TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS SESSION, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE SUBSEQUENT POLITICAL DIALOGUE ON NOVEMBER </p><p>15.  THE US-VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE OPERATES IN </p><p>PARALLEL WITH SIMILAR REGULAR OR SEMI-REGULAR EXCHANGES </p><p>(USUALLY NOT LABELED AS SPECIFIC "HUMAN RIGHTS" </p><p>DIALOGUES) WITH THE EU, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, SWEDEN, </p><p>NORWAY, AND SWITZERLAND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THERE SHOULD BE NO ILLUSIONS, HOWEVER, THAT WE </p><p>SHOULD EXPECT ANY MEETING OF THE MINDS BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>DELEGATIONS ON THE NATURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE </p><p>EXTENT OF PROBLEMS IN VIETNAM.  GVN OFFICIALS REMAIN </p><p>OFFICIALLY WEDDED TO THE PROPAGANDA THAT THE CPV HAS </p><p>BEEN THE SAVIOR OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE FROM CENTURIES </p><p>OF WHAT THEY SEE AS TYRANNY BY OUTSIDE FORCES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE U.S.  AS SUCH, THEY VIEW THE CPV (AND, </p><p>THROUGH IT, THE GVN ITSELF) AS THE CREATOR (NOT EVEN </p><p>RESTORER) OF THOSE RIGHTS NOW ENJOYED BY THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>VIETNAM, PRIMARILY THAT OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE BUT </p><p>ALSO OF THE LARGER SOCIETAL "RIGHTS" OF STABILITY, </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND EQUALITY.  TO GVN OFFICIALS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02612  01 OF 02  300231Z </p><p>THE BOTTOM LINE QUESTIONS WHEN TALKING ABOUT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS IN VIETNAM REMAIN "ARE THE LIVES OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE PEOPLE BETTER NOW THAN BEFORE 1986 (WHEN THE </p><p>POLICY OF DOI MOI BEGAN)? THAN BEFORE 1975?  THAN </p><p>BEFORE 1954?"  THE CPV CLAIM THAT THE ANSWER IN ALL </p><p>THREE CASES IS "YES" IS PROBABLY MOSTLY CORRECT, EXCEPT </p><p>FOR THE GREATER CIVIL LIBERTIES, E.G., PRESS AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, ENJOYED IN THE SOUTH BEFORE 1975. </p><p>(REFTEL DESCRIBED SOME OF THE IMPORTANT EXPANSIONS IN </p><p>PERSONAL FREEDOMS AT LEAST SINCE 1986.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SUSPICIONS REMAIN DEEP AND REAL THAT THE U.S. </p><p>HAS SOME SINISTER AGENDA -- CALL IT PEACEFUL EVOLUTION, </p><p>OR GLOBALIZATION, OR HEGEMONY, OR WHATEVER -- IN </p><p>RAISING HUMAN RIGHTS WITH VIETNAM AND OTHER LIKE </p><p>COUNTRIES.  GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>OUR INTEREST IS BENIGN AND THAT WE GENUINELY CARE ABOUT </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM.  MANY OF THEM STILL BELIEVE THAT </p><p>OUR REAL GOAL REMAINS TO DEFEAT GLOBAL COMMUNISM AND </p><p>ENSURE THAT THESE REGIMES TURN INTO AMERICAN-STYLE </p><p>DEMOCRACIES.  THEY SEE THE U.S. AS A WORLD-CLASS BULLY </p><p>INTENT ON IMPOSING ITS OWN VALUES ON COUNTRIES -- </p><p>INCLUDING VIETNAM -- THAT, BECAUSE THEY NEED ACCESS TO </p><p>OUR MARKETS, ARE OBLIGED TO LISTEN TO US COMPLAINTS AND </p><p>CRITICISMS, WHILE PUBLICLY REJECTING THE US\' RIGHT TO </p><p>"INTERFERE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS."   EVEN THE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE DELEGATION WHO ARE MOST SAVVY ABOUT THE US SYSTEM </p><p>AND IDEALS LIKELY BELIEVE THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THESE </p><p>US CONCERNS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IN VIETNAM ARE NO MORE </p><p>THAN NITPICKING ABOUT ISSUES AND SITUATIONS THAT WE DO </p><p>NOT TRULY UNDERSTAND. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02612  01 OF 02  300231Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BUT THE VIETNAMESE INSISTENCE -- BOTH IN THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS IN SECTIONS OF THE PENAL CODE </p><p>APPLIED TO FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY AND A MORE RECENT CASE </p><p>INVOLVING LE CHI QUANG --ON THE ENSHRINED PRIORITY OF </p><p>NATIONAL SOLIDARITY, AS WELL AS THE FREQUENT REFERENCES </p><p>TO THREATS TO INTERNAL STABILITY, MAY REFLECT AN </p><p>UNACKNOWLEDGED ANXIETY THAT LONGER TERM TRENDS FOR </p><p>VIETNAM DO INDEED NOT FAVOR THE CONTINUED MONOPOLY </p><p></p></div>
