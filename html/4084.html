<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CASC, PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VIOLENCE FLARES AGAIN IN JOS; PART OF A </p><p>CONTINUING TREND IN PLATEAU STATE. </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2809 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Communal violence continued to plague parts </p><p>of Plateau State, including areas of the capital Jos. Initial </p><p>reports from Amcits resident there indicated spill-over </p><p>violence in Jos after at least 10 were killed in the nearby </p><p>village of Maza. Military troops have restored order to the </p><p>area but the atmosphere remains tense and violence can </p><p>rekindle quickly.  According to our sources, no Amcits have </p><p>been injured or even involved in the violence. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Recent Violence </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The morning of October 23, Post received reports of </p><p>violence in Jos from Amcits living in the city. Apparently, </p><p>fighting had broken out in Maza village, northeast of Jos. </p><p>According to media reports the village was "attacked" during </p><p>the night of October 22. The attackers were reported to be </p><p>armed with automatic weapons and bows with poison arrows. </p><p>Governor Joshua Dariye of Plateau State ordered security </p><p>forces to use lethal force in order to quell the violence. It </p><p>took security forces 2 hours to subdue the attackers. </p><p>Newspapers report that 88 suspects, mostly Fulani and some </p><p>foreigners were arrested. Gabriel Makan, personal assistant </p><p>to the governor, blamed foreign "mercenaries" for other </p><p>recent attacks in Plateau State.  There is some speculation </p><p>that Nigerien and Chadian outlaws have participated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Comment: For many years criminal bands comprised of </p><p>Nigerian, Chadian and Nigerien elements have operated in </p><p>Northern Nigeria, particularly in the corridor encompassing </p><p>Borno, Bauchi, Gombe and Yobe States.  At times these bands </p><p>have struck in Plateau State.  If reports of criminal </p><p>participation in these acts are true it seems that their </p><p>presence in Plateau is much more pronounced than in the past. </p><p> Part of the reason may be they have had to expand their </p><p>circle of operation due to diminishing returns elsewhere. </p><p>However, some of the information received indicates that </p><p>feuding ethnic groups and villages may be hiring these </p><p>outlaws in hopes of gaining the upper hand against their </p><p>rivals.  The injection of these criminals will make local </p><p>disputes more violent and harder to contain. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Both media and Amcits reported that when the victims\' </p><p>bodies were transported from Maza to Jos, people became upset </p><p>when they saw the dead. Their agitation sparked a disturbance </p><p>in Jos itself, which was quickly subdued by security forces. </p><p>Another report indicated that the turmoil was also linked to </p><p>street-side traders being forced to move some of their </p><p>make-shift business locations. Gabriel Makan reported similar </p><p>action by the State Government had led to rioting earlier </p><p>this month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Amcit heard reports of trucks loaded with troops </p><p>entering the affected areas in Jos, followed by reports that </p><p>fighting had stopped. The situation, however, remained tense. </p><p>Amcit also reported that there was significantly reduced </p><p>vehicular traffic in Jos, even during the normal rush hour. </p><p>Unconfirmed reports claimed that schools had been closed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) At approximately 9:00 AM October 23 the Plateau State </p><p>Governor, Joshua Dariye, reported via State radio that there </p><p>had been an attack on a village near Jos and that 3 people </p><p>had been killed, but the situation was under control. (Note: </p><p>Media reports now claim 10 were killed; underreporting of </p><p>casualties by state officials is common. End Note.) He </p><p>further stated "there is reasonable peace" in the city of Jos </p><p>and that there was no need for panic.  The Governor repeated </p><p>a similar message every 10 minutes, appealing for calm. By </p><p>11:00 a.m. Amcit reported that there was still little traffic </p><p>on the road, but he heard or saw no further evidence of </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Background to the Crisis </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The October 23 report is the most recent in a series </p><p>of violent incidents that have flared in Plateau State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) On October 2 in Jos, Conoff observed a row of medium </p><p>sized Nigerian Army tents pitched along the roadside of the </p><p>border between Christian and Muslim sections of town. Each </p><p>tent appeared to house 8-12 Nigerian Army soldiers who were </p><p>in full combat uniform and armed with AK-47 assault rifles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Gabriel Makan reported that many of the outbreaks </p><p>could be traced to competing claims over cattle herds and </p><p>land. Several outbreaks of violence have occurred when </p><p>herders attempted to reclaim cattle. If the herder could not </p><p>find his own animals, he would take a corresponding number </p><p>from another herd.  The wronged owner would retaliate and </p><p>violence would begin again. Perhaps more worrisome, Makan </p><p>indicated that several attacks have been carried out by </p><p>Muslim Fulani raiders on non-Muslim villages.  While these </p><p>attacks were probably due to competition over local </p><p>resources, the identities of the rural groups lends both </p><p>ethnic and religious overtones to the violence.  Makan </p><p>claimed that several raiders had been apprehended and killed. </p><p> The Plateau State Government claimed these raiders were </p><p>mercenaries from outside Plateau State, with some coming from </p><p>Chad and Niger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (SBU) Order has been established after the latest </p><p>violence but many Plateau residents fear the calm is tenuous </p><p>and dependent on visible military deployments in the troubled </p><p>areas.  The unfortunate confluence of divergent ethnic groups </p><p>and the competition for land and livestock inherent at the </p><p>level of subsistence farming that is common throughout much </p><p>of Plateau State, indicates the eruption of communal violence </p><p>will continue to be one of the State\'s major challenges in </p><p>the near term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) While Plateau State may not be able to end the </p><p>outbreaks, it must do its best to contain them.  By deploying </p><p>strong and adequate law enforcement and working with </p><p>community leaders, the Plateau State Government should be </p><p>able to minimize the participation of criminal bands lest </p><p>violence in Plateau escalate again to the levels we have </p><p>witnessed in the recent past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
