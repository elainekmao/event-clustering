(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In the course of a 1/22 meeting with visiting </p><p>NEA A/S Burns, MFA Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid Al- </p><p>Nahyan briefed on the difficulties he is </p><p>encountering sealing a deal with Iran on Abu Musa, </p><p>one of three Gulf islands occupied by Iran but </p><p>claimed by both the UAE and Iran.  In contrast to </p><p>his earlier optimism, conveyed to the Ambassador as </p><p>recently as one month ago (ref a), Hamdan now </p><p>believes that the "difficult internal situation" in </p><p>Iran -- namely the strengthening of the hardliners </p><p>at the expense of the reformers -- has made progress </p><p>towards a deal more elusive.  Hamdan explained that </p><p>the UAE had worked with Khatemi and the reformers to </p><p>move the deal along but now that the hardliners have </p><p>the upper hand, it has apparently been put on hold. </p><p>He does not expect the situation to change; in fact, </p><p>with military action looming in Iraq, it is the UAE </p><p>leadership\'s collective belief that the position of </p><p>the Iranian hardliners will only strengthen. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  Hamdan is clearly disappointed at </p><p>this setback, having come so close to sealing the </p><p>deal.  He expended a lot of time (two trips to </p><p>Tehran and countless hours in Abu Dhabi with Iranian </p><p>envoy Muhammad Abtahi, Khatemi\'s chef de cabinet who </p><p>was subsequently promoted to the post of Vice </p><p>President) and prestige.  We expect the Emiratis </p><p>will sit tight for now, though they clearly would </p><p>have liked to remove this irritant in their </p><p>bilateral relationship with Iran before any major </p><p>regional geostrategic upheaval.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) A/S Burns did not clear this message. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
