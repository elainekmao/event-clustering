The Turkish leader called the </p><p>President the other day to offer condolences for the Riyadh </p><p>bombings. According to all papers Bush said that the U.S. </p><p>would cooperate with Turkey in Iraq\'s rebuilding and asked </p><p>for support for the Mideast road map, while Erdogan, </p><p>agreeing, vowed to send Foreign Minister Gul to Israel.  The </p><p>rapprochement was further strengthened when National </p><p>Security Advisor Rice stressed the strategic alliance </p><p>between the two countries, reports note.  U.S. officials </p><p>bear in mind Turkey\'s concern over the security situation in </p><p>Northern Iraq, and vowed to eliminate the terrorist threat </p><p>in the region.  Nevertheless, papers report that the U.S. </p><p>has told Ankara that the struggle against PKK/KADEK terror </p><p>was not among immediate American priorities.  Meanwhile, </p><p>"Yeni Safak" reports Deputy SecDefense Wolfowitz would pay a </p><p>`make up\' visit to Turkish peacekeeping troops during his </p><p>trip to Bosnia Herzegovina on Friday. </p><p>Deputy Treasury Secretary John Taylor: Most dailies and TV </p><p>news report that Deputy Secretary of Treasury Taylor said </p><p>that negotiation over the $1 billion grant for Turkey will </p><p>be discussed immediately after the conclusion of the 5th IMF </p><p>review.  Taylor noted Turkey\'s situation would be taken up </p><p>at the upcoming G-8 finance ministers\' meeting in France. </p><p>Taylor is reported to have said that Iraq\'s reconstruction </p><p>process will create job opportunities for Turkish </p><p>companies,. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister Babacan to Bilderberg meetings: "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>State Minister for economy, Ali Babacan would attend the </p><p>Bilderberg meetings in Paris on Friday.  The paper reminds </p><p>readers that Islamists have always fired strong criticism at </p><p>political figures such as ANAP\'s former leader Mesut Yilmaz </p><p>and social democrat Erdal Inonu participating at the `summit </p><p>of Zionists.\'  Paul Wolfowitz will be the `surprise\' guest </p><p>at the meetings, according to Hurriyet.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>ruling AKP deputies and cabinet members will gather at a </p><p>resort in Antalya on Friday for a three-day consultation </p><p>process before the party congress in August, papers report. </p><p>Commentators point to growing disagreement among the members </p><p>of AKP, which they regard as a `patchwork\' instead of a </p><p>disciplined political party.  On the other hand, papers </p><p>report Foreign Minister Gul as saying that AKP would apply </p><p>for membership to the Christian Democrat Party\'s wing of the </p><p>Parliament of Europe (ironic for an "Islamist" party). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Edelman  - U.S. envoy to Ankara: A "Sabah" editorial says </p><p>Eric Edelman, advisor to Dick Cheney, and an expert on the </p><p>Middle East and Russia, will be assigned as U.S. Ambassador </p><p>to Ankara later this summer.  Edelman is among the </p><p>`Preventive War\' theoreticians like Wolfowitz and Khalilzad. </p><p>The article opines that Washington is sending a `hawk\' to </p><p>Ankara to contribute to the restructuring of the Middle </p><p>East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Aftermath of Riyadh Bombings </p><p>b) Turkish-Kurdish Issues </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Return of Al Qaida" </p><p>Erdal Guven commented in liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(5/16): "Despite all the indications and speculations about </p><p>`Al Qaida is finished\', the recent Riyadh bombings seems to </p><p>prove what American expert Peter Bergen was saying.  Bergen, </p><p>a known Al Qaida expert believes that the organization is </p><p>more of an ideology than a network.  . Al Qaida is not only </p><p>targeting the US, but also the pro-American regimes in the </p><p>region.  Thus it comes as no surprise that Saudi Arabia </p><p>becomes a frequent target. . There is a lesson to learn from </p><p>the Riyadh bombings. Al Qaida, as an ideology, is not going </p><p>to be flexible in negotiation, for making concessions or </p><p>reconciliation.  Yet the antidote for Al Qaida will come </p><p>through the rapid implementation of political, economic and </p><p>social reforms in all of the Arab regimes, particularly the </p><p>Saudi regime. Otherwise the termionation of Al Qaida will </p><p>remain an impossible goal. . In the meantime, the big </p><p>picture, i.e. Palestine-Israel issue, must not be ignored. </p><p>If the issue remains unsettled, we will see the return of Al </p><p>Qaida many times." </p><p>"Cold war in northern Iraq" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli noted in tabloid Star (5/16): "Washington </p><p>stated the need for humanitarian aid in Iraq and invited </p><p>Turkish NGOs to become involved.  Ankara welcomed this </p><p>message and began working for cooperation with the US. </p><p>However, the Kurdish groups in northern Iraq are very much </p><p>occupied in finding ways of getting Turkey out of the area. </p><p>The Kurdish Parliament in the area recently adopted a </p><p>decision to call for the dissolution of the `Peace </p><p>Monitoring Force\' which protected Kurdish groups since 1996. </p><p>. This group was initiated by Turkey and kept 800 Turkish </p><p>soldiers on duty.  Assyrians and Turkomans also served in </p><p>this group.  It remains to be seen what would be </p><p>Washington\'s reaction to this unanimous decision by the </p><p>Kurdish parliament.  At the moment, Ankara is asking </p><p>Washington for the continuation of the mission, while the </p><p>Kurdish groups are pressuring for the dissolution.   It </p><p>seems the `cold war\' in northern Iraq is to continue, at </p><p>least for the foreseeable future." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
