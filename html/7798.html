<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TRADING WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 104141 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 1213 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 1578 </p><p>     D. KUWAIT 1617 </p><p>     E. KUWAIT 1683 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post responses are provided to questions posed in reftel. </p><p> </p><p>Q: WE UNDERSTAND THAT IRAQ HAS COMPLETED FREE TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES. IF HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS AN FTA WITH IRAQ, WHAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT? I.E. DOES IT SIMPLY COVER GOODS, OR DOES IT </p><p>COVER OTHER AREAS AS WELL? WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THIS </p><p>AGREEMENT? WITH CHANGE IN IRAQ\'S REGIME, IS IT STILL </p><p>VALID? WHERE DOES IMPLEMENTATION STAND ON THESE </p><p>AGREEMENTS AND THE PAN ARAB FREE TRADE AGREEMENT? </p><p> </p><p>A:  Post contacts confirm that Kuwait does not currently have </p><p>an FTA with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q:  WHAT DO YOUR HOST GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE </p><p>THINK OF THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE WITH IRAQ? WAS THERE A </p><p>TRADITIONAL LINK THAT WILL BE RE-ESTABLISHED? DO THEY </p><p>EXPECT IT TO POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT DOMESTIC </p><p>MARKETS? DO THEY STILL HAVE BUSINESS CONTACTS IN IRAQ? </p><p> </p><p>A. Post has reported extensively on Kuwait\'s views on doing </p><p>business with a post-Saddam Iraq (see reftels).  In short, </p><p>Kuwait has extensive historical, trade, and family ties with </p><p>Iraq that it hopes to quickly reestablish and exploit.  In </p><p>the short run Kuwaitis hope to profit generously from </p><p>reestablished trade with Iraq, but realize that without </p><p>significant domestic economic reform the country stands to be </p><p>left behind as the Iraqi economy becomes a magnet for </p><p>investment.  Kuwait has not traded with Iraq since the 1990 </p><p>invasion, but is working to reestablish pre-invasion business </p><p>ties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q. WHAT CAN HOST COUNTRY CONTACTS TELL US ABOUT THE </p><p>CUSTOMS REGIME UNDER SADDAM, PRE AND POST SANCTIONS? WAS </p><p>THERE AN IMPORT TARIFF REGIME? WERE THERE OTHER FEES OR </p><p>ASSESSMENTS? WAS THERE A FUNCTIONING CUSTOMS REGIME, </p><p>ELEMENTS OF WHICH COULD BE RETAINED UNDER A NEW IRAQI </p><p>REGIME (OR INTERIM AUTHORITY). </p><p> </p><p>A. Post is working with Kuwait Customs on these questions, to </p><p>be reported septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q. UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY TRADE OUTSIDE OF THE FOOD FOR </p><p>OIL PROGRAM WAS NOT LEGAL AND THEREFORE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>CLOSELY MONITORED BY OFFICIAL SOURCES. TO THE EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE, WE ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING TRADE STATISTICS </p><p>FROM 1999-2001. EVEN ESTIMATES WOULD BE HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>A. Kuwait has not traded with Iraq since the 1990 invasion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q.  WHAT KINDS OF ASSISTANCE DO YOU FORESEE BEING REQUIRED </p><p>BY IRAQ TO ENABLE TRADE TO COMMENCE ONCE SANCTIONS ARE </p><p>LIFTED? WHAT TYPES OF SHORT, MEDIUM TERM TRADE-RELATED </p><p>ASSISTANCE DO YOU THINK IRAQI AUTHORITIES REQUIRE? </p><p> </p><p>A. Please see refs B and D.  It is worth noting that at a </p><p>recent Kuwait Economic Society meeting on Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction, the chairman of the Finance and Economic </p><p>Committee of the National Assembly called on the GOK to </p><p>create a company to guarantee Kuwaiti investment in Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
