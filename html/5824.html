SATIA APPRECIATED RECEIVING THE U.S. DEMARCHE AND </p><p>STATED THAT HE AND OTHERS IN FAO FISHERIES WOULD, AS </p><p>ALWAYS, STUDY THE DOCUMENT CAREFULLY IN ADVANCE OF THE </p><p>SESSION BEGINNING MONDAY, 2/24. </p><p> </p><p>3. REGARDING THE UNFSA DISCUSSION, SATIA SAID THERE WAS </p><p>NO NEED TO RAISE THE ISSUE UNDER "OTHER MATTERS." </p><p>INSTEAD, HE SUGGESTED THAT IT BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION </p><p>OF THE PROGRESS REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CODE, </p><p>WHICH BEGINS ON MONDAY (2/24) AFTERNOON (AGENDA ITEM 5) </p><p>AND CONTINUES THROUGH TUESDAY (2/25) MORNING.

SATIA VISIBLY CRINGED WHEN THE IDEA OF CHANGES TO THE </p><p>AGENDA FROM THE FLOOR WAS RAISED, STATING THAT HE HOPED </p><p>NOT TO "WASTE TIME" DEBATING THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING, </p><p>SINCE A FULL SLATE OF ITEMS IS ALREADY SCHEDULED AND </p><p>EVENING OR WEEKEND SESSIONS ENVISIONED.  HE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>MENTIONED THAT ISSUES SUCH AS CORAL REEFS, TURTLES AND </p><p>DEEP SEA MATTERS COULD BE DISCUSSED UNDER IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF THE CODE OR EVEN DURING THE ECOSYSTEMS DEBATE (ITEM </p><p>11).  ABSENT ANY GUDANCE REGARDING WHAT CHANGES MIGHT BE </p><p>PROPOSED, TE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE PROMISED ONLY TO RELAY </p><p>SATA\'S CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00677  01 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>5. DRAFTING COMMITTEE AND BUREAU:OECD CHAIR (NEW </p><p>ZEALAND) WAS ABLE TO SECURE ONE EXTRA OECD SEAT ON THE </p><p>DRAFTING COMMITTEE (SEVEN INSTEAD OF SIX), BUT STILL HAD </p><p>DIFFICULTY WINNOWING DOWN THE LIST OF INTERESTED PARTIES. </p><p>ABSENT A CONSENSUS, THE "FALLBACK" IS TWO MEMBERS PER </p><p>REGIONAL GROUP.  THUS, BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA </p><p>(NORTH AMERICA) WILL BE INCLUDED, WHILE THE EUROPEANS </p><p>(ERG) WERE FORCED EITHER TO PICK TWO AMONGST THEMSELVES </p><p>OR CONVINCE JAPAN TO STAND DOWN (IN THE END, SWEDEN </p><p>WITHDREW).  STILL TO BE DECIDED IS THE FATE OF THE NORTH </p><p>AMERICAN VICE CHAIR.  THE CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE IS VERY </p><p>RELUCTANT TO SERVE, AND IN FACT CANADA HAS SERVED AS VICE- </p><p>CHAIR DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO COFI MEETINGS.  THE OECD </p><p>CHAIRMAN WOULD LIKE THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE UP THE </p><p>MANTLE.  ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE ADVISE U.S. POSITION ON </p><p>VICE CHAIRMANSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM ICELAND FORWARDED BY E-MAIL A </p><p>PROPOSAL RELATED TO CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN FAO AND </p><p>CITES.  THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT COFI ESTABLISH AN </p><p>EXPERT PANEL TO ASSESS PROPOSALS TO AMEND CITES </p><p>APPENDICES I AND II.  THE PANEL, TO BE CHAIRED BY A </p><p>SENIOR FAO FISHERIES RESOURCES OFFICER, WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>CITES WITH AN ASSESSMENT CAPABILITY FROM THE FISHERIES </p><p>SECTOR.  THE PANEL WOULD ASSESS PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS </p><p>THAT INVOLVE COMMERCIALLY EXPLOITED AQUATIC SPECIES.  THE </p><p>PANEL\'S "POINT OF DEPARTURE" WOULD BE THAT SUCH SPECIES </p><p>WOULD ONLY BE INCLUDED IN THE APPENDICES IN EXCEPTIONAL </p><p>CASES.  THE DRAFT PROPOSAL WAS FORWARDED BY E-MAIL TO </p><p>TINKHAM/MCIFF. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        ROME  00677  01 OF 02  191552Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7247 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00677  02 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>ACTION OES-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CG-00    CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  FMC-01 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------3837DC  191611Z /38 </p><p>R 191503Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8331 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY REYKJAVIK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE U.S. MISSION TO THE UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>FOR OES/OMC STETSON TINKHAM/COLIN MCIFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIS, ETRD, SENV, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO FISHERIES PERSONNEL DISCUSS COFI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00677  02 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>7.
