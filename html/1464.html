<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LONDON 008980 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 217248 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE UNITED KINGDOM CONTINUED ITS AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS </p><p>AGAINST DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 2000.  IT </p><p>PASSED A NEW TERRORISM LAW THAT GIVES THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED </p><p>POWERS TO FIGHT BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TERRORISM, AND IT </p><p>CONTINUED ITS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES TO </p><p>BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>A.  RESPONSE OF THE UK JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM DURING 2000:  TWELVE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN CHARGED </p><p>BASED ON THEIR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE FEBRUARY 7 </p><p>HIJACKING OF AN AFGHAN ARIANA AIRLINER THAT LANDED AT </p><p>STANSTED AIRPORT.  THE CHARGES INCLUDE HIJACKING, FALSE </p><p>IMPRISONMENT, POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WITH INTENT TO CAUSE </p><p>FEAR OF VIOLENCE, AND POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES.  THEIR TRIAL </p><p>IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON JANUARY 15, 2001.  FOLLOWING A </p><p>U.S.-UK INITIATIVE, THE TRIAL OF TWO LIBYANS CHARGED WITH THE </p><p>BOMBING IN 1988 OF PAN AM 103 OVER LOCKERBIE SCOTLAND BEGAN </p><p>IN MAY 2000 IN A SCOTTISH COURT SITTING IN THE NETHERLANDS. </p><p>THE ACCUSED ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER, BREACH OF THE UK </p><p>AVIATION SECURITY ACT, AND CONSPIRACY.  AT YEAR END, THE </p><p>TRIAL CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>IN APRIL, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>THE GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE CONDUCTED SEARCHES AT TWO </p><p>LOCATIONS IN MANCHESTER IDENTIFIED AS RESIDENCES OF TWO </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED HAS HAVING BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH USAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN AND AL-QUEDA.  IN NOVEMBER, TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE </p><p>ARRESTED IN BIRMINGHAM FOR CONSPIRACY TO CAUSE EXPLOSIONS </p><p>UNDER THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE SUBJECTS, MOINUL </p><p>ABEDIN AND FAISAL MUSTAFA, FACE LIFE IMPRISONMENT IN THE UK </p><p>IF CONVICTED. </p><p> </p><p>DURING 2000, HMG CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST </p><p>MURDERS RELATING TO THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE THE 1998 BOMBING IN OMAGH, WHICH KILLED 29 PERSONS, </p><p>AND THE MARCH, 1999 MURDER OF ROSEMARY NELSON, A DEFENSE </p><p>LAWYER.  OFFICIALS MADE PUBLIC SOME OF THE INFORMATION THEY </p><p>HAVE COLLECTED ON BOTH CASES AND APPEALED FOR WITNESSES TO </p><p>COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SUSPECTS TO </p><p>BE PROSECUTED. </p><p> </p><p>HMG ALSO PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  IT CONTINUES TO PURSUE THE CASES OF BRITISH AND </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS MURDERED IN YEMEN IN 1998 AND THE MURDER OF </p><p>BRITISH CITIZENS IN UGANDA IN 1999.  IT IS WORKING WITH GREEK </p><p>OFFICIALS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>MURDER IN ATHENS ON JUNE 8 OF THE BRITISH MILITARY ATTACHE </p><p>BRIGADIER SAUNDERS.  THE 17 NOVEMBER GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT </p><p>FOR THE MURDER.  HMG IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>YEMEN TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK ON </p><p>THE BRITISH EMBASSY THERE IN OCTOBER, AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF SAUDI ARABIA RELATIVE TO THE ATTACKS AND MURDER OF BRITISH </p><p>CITIZENS IN THAT COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>B.  UK RECORD OF EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  THE UK </p><p>CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE UNITED STATES IN REGARD </p><p>TO THE U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF INDIVIDUALS INDICTED </p><p>IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON TERRORISM-RELATED </p><p>CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN </p><p>NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM. KHALED AL-FAWWAZ, IBRAHIM HUSSEIN </p><p>ABDEL HADI EIDAROUS, AND ABEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMAGID BARY </p><p>HAVE ALL BEEN FOUND BY UK COURTS TO BE SUBJECT TO EXTRADITION </p><p>TO THE U.S.  THEIR APPEALS TO THIS FINDING ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>BEFORE BRITISH COURTS.  HMG IS ALSO COOPERATING WITH A </p><p>REQUEST BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SEEKING THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>RASHID RAMDA, AN ALGERIAN WANTED IN CONNECTION WITH A SERIES </p><p>OF BOMBINGS IN FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  IT IS HMG POLICY TO </p><p>PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  HMG PURSUES </p><p>THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, AND UK ASYLUM </p><p>LAWS.  UNLIKE U.S. LAW, BRITISH LAW DOES NOT GIVE UK </p><p>AUTHORITIES EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION IN TERRORISM CASES. </p><p> </p><p>D.  UK RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION TO TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS:  HMG CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>AND PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP STRONG </p><p>COUNTERTERRORIST MEASURES.  UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>WORKING CLOSELY ON THE GROUND WITH BOTH GREEK AND SAUDI </p><p>OFFICIALS TO ASSIST THE HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS INTO ATTACKS ON BRITISH SUBJECTS OR INTERESTS. </p><p> HMG CONSULTS WITH AND PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS </p><p>THAT ARE PREPARED TO DEVELOP AND PURSUE POLICIES TO FIGHT </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY HMG IN 2000: </p><p> </p><p>IN JULY, A NEW UK-WIDE TERRORISM ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW, </p><p>EXTENDING MECHANISMS AND POWERS THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED TO </p><p>DEAL WITH TERRORISM RELATING TO NORTHERN IRELAND TO ALL FORMS </p><p>OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TERRORISM ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM. </p><p>THE LAW, WHICH COMES INTO FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2001, REPLACES </p><p>THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT OF </p><p>1989 AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT OF </p><p>1996 (AMENDED IN 1998). </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW LAW WILL APPLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TO </p><p>ALL FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  IT WIDENS </p><p>THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE ACTIONS OR THREATS OF </p><p>ACTION THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT OR </p><p>INTIMIDATE THE PUBLIC TO ADVANCE A POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL CAUSE AND THAT INVOLVE SERIOUS VIOLANCE AGAINST A </p><p>PERSON OR SERIOUS DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, ENDANGERS A PERSON\'S </p><p>LIFE, CREATES A SERIOUS RISK TO THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THE </p><p>PUBLIC, OR IS DESIGNED TO SERIOUSLY INTERFERE WITH AN </p><p>ELECTRONIC SYSTEM.  THE ACT GIVES THE POLICE SPECIAL ARREST </p><p>POWERS IN TERRORIST CASES AND ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>PROSCRIBE ORGANIZATIONS CONCERNED WITH ANY FORM OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND TO PROSECUTE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATE IN OR SUPPORT SUCH ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>OR THEIR ACTIVITIES.  THE LAW ENHANCES THE GOVERNMENT\'S POWER </p><p>TO SEIZE RESOURCES RELATING TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>A NEW REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS ACT, WHICH BECAME </p><p>LAW IN JULY 2000, ESTABLISHES ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERCEPTION </p><p>OF COMMUNICATIONS AND A STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE AUTHORIZATION </p><p>AND USE OF COVERT SURVEILLANCE.  THE ACT GIVES ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS NEEDED LEVERAGE IN DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS OR </p><p>GROUPS SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN TERRORIST-RELATED </p><p>ACTIVITIES WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC FROM UNNECESSARY </p><p>INVASIONS OF THEIR PRIVACY.  BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE INITIATED </p><p>COOPERATIVE EFFORTS WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO ASSIST THEM </p><p>IN BRINGING TO JUSTICE INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND TO DETER ACTS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>HMG SIGNED THE UN CONVENTION ON TERRORIST BOMBING ON JANUARY </p><p>10, 2000, THE FIRST DAY THE CONVENTION WAS OPENED FOR </p><p>SIGNING.  IT IS COMMITTED TO RATIFYING THAT CONVENTION AND </p><p>THE CONVENTION ON TERRORIST FINANCING, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN </p><p>1998, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS:  HMG DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY FORM OF TERRORISM </p><p>OR ANY TERRORISTS.  IT ACTIVELY OPPOSES INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, TERRORISTS AND TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS COMMITTED TO PREVENTING THE UK BEING USED AS A BASE FOR </p><p>TERRORISM, INCLUDING AS A SOURCE FOR FUNDING OF TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES ABROAD.  THE NEW TERRORISM ACT WILL ENHANCE HMG </p><p>AUTHORITIES\' ABILITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRIES ON A TERRORIST ISSUE:  HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF </p><p>TERRORISM ON TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES.  IT CONSISTENTLY </p><p>SPEAKS OUT PUBLICLY IN OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM AND USES ITS </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED AS </p><p>SUPPORTING OR TOLERATING TERRORISM, TO DO THE SAME. </p><p> </p><p>H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE UK\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM </p><p>DURING 2000:  THE UK REMAINS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM </p><p>IN ALL FORMS. </p><p> </p><p>I.  U.S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVESS PURSUED IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH HMG:  HMG COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. </p><p>AT ALL LEVELS ON COUNTERTERRORISM POLICIES AND OPERATIONS, </p><p>BOTH BILATERALLY AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING </p><p>THE G8 AND THE UN.  THIS COOPERATION INCLUDES REGULAR </p><p>BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS ON POLICY AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>WASHINGTON\'S CLOSE TIES TO BOTH LONDON AND DUBLIN FACILITATED </p><p>OUR CONTINUING KEY ROLE IN FACILITATING THE PEACE PROCESS IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE RESULT OF THE CLOSE COOPERATION HAS </p><p>BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND </p><p>CONTINUED PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF POLITICAL, </p><p>POLICING AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS AS CALLED FOR IN THE GOOD </p><p>FRIDAY AGREEMENT.  U.S. OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY </p><p>WITH BRITISH AND IRISH COUNTERPARTS TO CONTAIN THE CONTINUED </p><p>TERRORIST THREAT PRESENTED BY DISSIDENT REPUBLICAN AND </p><p>LOYALIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  INCIDENTS OR ATTEMPTS DURING </p><p>2000 INCLUDE INTRACOMMUNITY FEUDS AND PUNISHMENT ATTACKS ON </p><p>CIVILIANS AS WELL AS ACTIONS AGAINST POLICE, SECURITY AND </p><p>MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND PERSONNEL IN BOTH NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>AND GREAT BRITAIN.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED THE </p><p>REAL IRA, THE CONTINUITY IRA, THE RED HAND DEFENDERS, AND THE </p><p>ORANGE VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT MAINTAINING A TOTAL AND UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>CEASE-FIRE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IN DECEMBER, HMG JOINED THE U.S. IN VOTING IN THE UNSC FOR </p><p>SANCTIONS TO BE IMPOSED ON THE TALIBAN.  IT HAS SUPPORTED THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF AN EU COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY AND ENCOURAGED </p><p>USE OF THE G8 MECHANISM TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>IN COUNTERING TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>J.  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN THE INVESTIGATION OR </p><p>PROSECUTION OF ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS OR INTERESTS:  COOPERATION BETWEEN THE USG AND HMG </p><p>HAS BEEN INVALUABLE TO THE UNITED STATES IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>ITS INVESTIGATION INTO USAMA BIN LADEN AND AL-QAEDA </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  HMG CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE USG TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT KHALID AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMADGID </p><p>BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN INDICTED IN </p><p>THE U.S. ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES, ARE EXTRADITED TO THE </p><p>U.S.  U.S.-UK COOPERATION HAS BEEN CRUCIAL IN BRINGING TO </p><p>TRIAL THE TWO LIBYANS CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING </p><p>OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 IN 1988. </p><p> </p><p>K.  PREVENTION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS IN THE </p><p>UK:  THE USG AND HMG SHARE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE TERRORIST </p><p>THREATS AND SPONSOR REGULAR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS, JOINT </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND EXERCISES WHICH FURTHER STRENGTHEN </p><p>COOPERATIVE EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>OR SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EMBASSY LONDON IS ALSO FORWARDING BY FAX SUGGESTED </p><p>REVISIONS TO THE TEXT OF APPENDIX B OF \'PATTERNS OF GLOBAL </p><p>TERRORISM - 1999\', WHICH PROVIDES BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, AND LANGUAGE PROVIDED BY HMG REGARDING </p><p>WHETHER CERTAIN OF THOSE GROUPS IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED TO BE ON CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EMBASSY LONDON REQUESTS THAT WE BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO REVIEW THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE MAIN TEXT AND SECTIONS OF </p><p>THE APPENDICES OF THE 2000 REPORT THAT DEAL WITH THE UK, </p><p>INCLUDING NORTHERN IRELAND, PRIOR TO PUBLICATION OF THE </p><p>REPORT.  WE WILL COORDINATE THIS REVIEW WITH CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL BELFAST TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATEMENTS AND </p><p>DESCRIPTIONS ARE CURRENT AND ACCURATE AT THE TIME OF </p><p>PUBLICATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LADER </p><p></p></div>
