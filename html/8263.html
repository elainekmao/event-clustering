Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) From April 26 to May 4, Embassy and USAID </p><p>representatives traveled to Nepal\'s northwest district of </p><p>Dolpa.  Fifteen of the district\'s twenty-five villages are </p><p>affected by Maoist activities, with six in the southwest </p><p>highly affected.  Maoists in the district have begun some </p><p>development work, in some cases applying to the Government </p><p>for materials.  In the district\'s Tibetan-speaking north, </p><p>Maoist outreach programs have been ineffective due to </p><p>language and cultural barriers.  A May 3 Maoist political </p><p>rally held in the district headquarters was approved by the </p><p>district government, which also provided food for up to 300 </p><p>attendees.  Political parties\' activities are limited to the </p><p>district\'s headquarters.  They charge that the Maoists are </p><p>violating the terms of the cease-fire and not allowing </p><p>freedom of travel to others.  Should the cease-fire break, </p><p>the government will have difficulty maintaining control of </p><p>southern Dolpa without significant military reinforcement. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy and Aid Officers Visit Maoist-affected Dolpa </p><p>============================================= ======== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) From April 26 to May 4, Embassy and USAID </p><p>representatives traveled to Nepal\'s northwest district of </p><p>Dolpa to evaluate USG development and environmental projects </p><p>(septel) and the security situation.  The trip entailed </p><p>travel by foot three days north and one day west of district </p><p>headquarters Dunai and encompassed many of the areas </p><p>afflicted by seven years of Maoist attacks in Dolpa.  The </p><p>district is still recovering from two significant attacks. </p><p>On April 2, 2002 the Maoists attacked Juphal Airport, closing </p><p>it for six months, while a September 25, 2000 attack on Dunai </p><p>killed 14 police and injured 24.  The closure of the airport </p><p>suspended government imports of rice, reportedly causing food </p><p>shortages. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Since 1996, the Maoists have destroyed all the </p><p>district\'s local government offices outside of Dunai; 16 of </p><p>17 police posts (the airport\'s police post was restored one </p><p>week before our arrival); 14 forestry offices (the one </p><p>remaining field office is now abandoned); the Juphal Airport </p><p>terminal; the jail; and a small Royal Nepal Army garrison. </p><p>The Embassy and USAID group identified Maoist slogans painted </p><p>on homes and prominent rock outcroppings on trails to the </p><p>north and west of Dunai, while Maoist flags were also </p><p>displayed in villages to the west of Dunai. </p><p> </p><p>Overview of Dolpa </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The district is home to an estimated 29,000 people </p><p>and is roughly bisected by topography and ethnicity.  The </p><p>mountainous north is inhabited by the Tibetan-speaking </p><p>Dolpo-pa, while the south is dominated by Nepali-speaking </p><p>Hindus.  The district has no motorable roads.  A four-day </p><p>walk is required to reach the nearest roadhead southwest of </p><p>the district headquarters.  The district has one airport, in </p><p>the village of Juphal, a three-hour walk from the district </p><p>headquarters.  The district is bordered by the Maoist </p><p>strongholds of Rukum and Jajarkot to the south and </p><p>increasingly Maoist-affected Jumla to the west. </p><p> </p><p>Security Forces\' Reports of Maoist Activities in Dolpa </p><p>============================================= ========== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Government control in the district is strictly </p><p>limited to the district headquarters in Dunai and the Juphal </p><p>airport.  Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Bachaspati </p><p>Regmi stated that of the district\'s twenty-three villages, </p><p>fifteen, mostly in the district\'s west, were affected by </p><p>Maoists, with six in the southwest highly affected.  He </p><p>reported that the Maoists allowed government health posts and </p><p>schools to operate.  The DSP also stated that fifteen </p><p>families had fled from southwestern Dolpa to the district </p><p>headquarters, but because of the cease-fire are now willing </p><p>to return home.  The police continue to patrol one day\'s </p><p>distance east and west from Dunai.  The DSP reports that </p><p>during these patrols they find little activity.  The police </p><p>in Dolpa no longer hold any Maoists prisoner, as they have </p><p>been unable to take prisoners into long-term custody after </p><p>the jail was destroyed in the September 2000 attack.  The </p><p>Maoist military wing is armed with Lee-Enfield .303 rifles </p><p>(stolen from the police and army), muskets, and home-made </p><p>socket bombs.  Royal Nepal Army (RNA) Company Commander Major </p><p>Raji Pandey and his deputy, Captain Laba Thapa, reported that </p><p>their company patrols one day north into the national park. </p><p>The USG team found the Army\'s well-marked campsite in the </p><p>park.  The position was located on two sides of a wooden </p><p>bridge and surrounded by Maoist graffiti. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Development Programs </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to Chief District Officer (CDO) G. P. </p><p>Dhakal, Maoists in western parts of the district have </p><p>undertaken the construction of trails and toilets and the </p><p>rebuilding of a school.  The Maoist leadership has approached </p><p>the CDO for materials to complete drinking water and bridge </p><p>projects.  The CDO stated that he has refused these requests </p><p>for now by reporting that neither he nor the Local </p><p>Development Office have the materials available.  Members of </p><p>the USG team witnessed a Maoist cadre leaving a </p><p>non-governmental organization office (NGO) in Dunai.  The NGO </p><p>staff later reported that the cadre had been seeking </p><p>information on the project.  The Dutch development agency, </p><p>SNV, is building a trail in southwestern Dolpa and reportedly </p><p>has to coordinate with the Maoists in order to move the </p><p>project forward. </p><p> </p><p>Dolpa\'s Maoists Ineffective with Dolpa\'s Tibetans </p><p>============================================= ===== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) From September 27 to 30, the USG group traveled </p><p>north into Dolpa\'s Shey-Phoksumdo National Park and regularly </p><p>observed Maoist graffiti along the trail.  At the northern </p><p>most point in the team\'s travel on the shore of Phoksumdo </p><p>Lake, the ethnically Tibetan villagers reported that they had </p><p>been approached by the Maoists.  However, the villagers said </p><p>they did not trust these outsiders and had difficulty in </p><p>understanding their Nepali. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Political Rally </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The USG team learned that the Maoists would be </p><p>conducting a cultural program in the district headquarters on </p><p>May 3.  (Note:  In an area where entertainment of any sort is </p><p>rare, cultural exhibitions of dance and song draw a large </p><p>crowd.  The Maoists have turned these events into rallies in </p><p>order to deliver their political messages.  End note.)  The </p><p>CDO and DSP reported that a Maoist representative had </p><p>approached them for approval of the event.  The CDO and DSP </p><p>stated that the program was within the cease-fire\'s code of </p><p>conduct and that they had no objection to the event, as long </p><p>as the Maoists came unarmed and out of uniform (also terms of </p><p>the code of conduct).  When the representative requested that </p><p>the CDO provide government rice for the program\'s estimated </p><p>1,500 participants, the CDO said he responded that he would </p><p>provide rice for no more than 300.  The CDO reported that the </p><p>Maoist representative agreed to the terms.  The USG team was </p><p>unable to learn the actual level of attendance. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) On May 2, members of the USG team trekked west of </p><p>the district headquarters.  En route, one member witnessed </p><p>forty Maoist cadres in transit to the next day\'s cultural </p><p>program.  The Maoists were between the ages of fourteen and </p><p>twenty-five, all of lower castes, well-dressed in western </p><p>clothing, and well-fed.  Two exceptions were the upper-caste </p><p>Maoist District Military Commander, who was in his </p><p>mid-thirties, in uniform, and carrying a battery-powered </p><p>bullhorn, and an upper-caste man in his early forties of </p><p>unidentified rank.  Many of the group\'s members carried </p><p>personal tape players and radios.  These items are considered </p><p>luxuries in this rural area, requiring expensive imported </p><p>tapes and batteries to operate.  As the USG team stopped in a </p><p>village 5 kilometers to the west, a local hotelier relayed </p><p>stories of a Maoist cultural program (cum political rally) </p><p>that took place in neighboring Jumla district headquarters a </p><p>week earlier. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Restrict and Victimize Political Parties </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML) and the Nepali Congress (NC) parties continue </p><p>to have representatives in the district headquarters.  In </p><p>past elections, the UML won 60-80 percent of the local polls, </p><p>while the NC won no more than 5 percent at any time.  The UML </p><p>District Secretary reported that of the more than 120 UML </p><p>cadre killed nationwide by the Maoists during the conflict, </p><p>one was in Dolpa.  The individual was tortured with a knife </p><p>and killed in front of his family.  The UML Secretary charged </p><p>that the Maoists are violating the code of conduct, </p><p>continuing to extort money and food, and compelling </p><p>attendance at Maoist meetings.  He also charged that the </p><p>political parties are not allowed freedom of movement within </p><p>the district, with the Maoists using robbery and beatings to </p><p>enforce this internal travel ban.  On May 2, the USG team met </p><p>the NC District Secretary on the trail, as he was fleeing </p><p>from the Maoists in the district headquarters.  His departure </p><p>was understandable.  Prior to the cease-fire, the NC </p><p>Secretary had been held for two weeks by the Maoists and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>beaten. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Maoists in Dolpa are capitalizing on the lack of </p><p>government presence in this remote district, due in large </p><p>part to their campaign of violence there over the past seven </p><p>years.  The cease-fire has allowed Maoist cadres to move </p><p>throughout the district and the district headquarters </p><p>unhindered by the security forces.  The Maoists\' efforts </p><p>appear to be aimed at restoring popular support, damaged </p><p>after their attack on the airport and destruction of other </p><p>government infrastructure.  The security forces have no plans </p><p>or resources to reassert government control, and the </p><p>political parties reported no plans to revitalize and </p><p>mobilize support.  International NGOs have continued to </p><p>operate in the district.  It appears, however, that their </p><p>efforts are closely monitored by the Maoists. Should </p><p>hostilities resume, the government presence in southern Dolpa </p><p>will be hard-pressed to cling to its limited territory and </p><p>will certainly be unable to carry forward any pacification </p><p>programs without massive reinforcement. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
