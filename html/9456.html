(SBU) US MISSION MET ON JULY 11 WITH LAURENT THOMAS, FAO </p><p>SENIOR OPERATIONS OFFICER, SPECIAL RELIEF OPERATIONS SERVICE </p><p>TO DISCUSS FAO\'S TRANSITION PLANS FOR ITS IRAQ OPERATIONS. </p><p>    FAO IS COGNIZANT OF THE NEED TO KEEP UP A DAILY DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY (CPA) IN "MANAGING" </p><p>THE TRANSITION. FAO NEITHER WANTS TO PROCEED AT THIS STAGE </p><p>WITHOUT PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH CPA NOR TO BE ACCUSED OF NOT </p><p>MOVING SWIFTLY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TRANSITION "HAPPEN" BY THE </p><p>UNSCR NOVEMBER 21 DEADLINE. US MISSION SHARES FAO\'S VIEW </p><p>THAT CFA DEPLOY SOONEST A SENIOR AGRICULTURE OFFICER TO THE </p><p>NORTHERN 3 GOVENORATES TO WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH FAO TO </p><p>"GUARANTEE" THE PHASE-OVER. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) US MISSION MET ON JULY 11 WITH LAURENT THOMAS, FAO </p><p>SENIOR OPERATIONS OFFICER, SPECIAL RELIEF OPERATIONS SERVICE </p><p>TO DISCUSS FAO\'S TRANSITION PLANS FOR ITS IRAQ OPERATIONS </p><p>PRESENTLY FUNDED BY THE UN OFFICE FOR IRAQ PROGRAMS (OIP) IN </p><p>NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) WORK IN THE NORTH - FAO CURRENTLY HAS PROJECTS </p><p>TOTALING USD 671 MILLION THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY OIP.  AS </p><p>OF 11 JULY, USD 478 MILLION HAD BEEN DISBURSED, AND FAO </p><p>EXPECTS THAT AN ADDITIONAL USD 40-60 MILLION WILL BE SPENT </p><p>BEFORE OCTOBER 1, WHICH IS THE DELIVERY DEADLINE THAT FAO </p><p>HAS GIVEN THE VENDORS/SUPPLIERS FOR THE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORATES.  PROJECTS FOR THE USD 40-60 MILLION ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY BEING JOINTLY SUBMITTED FROM FAO AND THE CPA, WHO </p><p>MUST APPROVE EACH PROJECT (AS SPECIFIED UNDER UNSCR 1483) </p><p>BEFORE IT IS SUBMITTED FOR APPROVAL TO FAO/HQ AND OIP.  THE </p><p>ESTIMATED BALANCE OF USD 133-153 MILLION WOULD BE </p><p>    SUPPLEMENTED BY INCOME THAT FAO IS CURRENTLY GENERATING BY </p><p>SELLING EQUIPMENT TO PRIVATE COMPANIES.  IN TOTAL, FAO </p><p>EXPECTS THERE TO BE A BALANCE OF USD 150-160 MILLION IN THE </p><p>13 PERCENT ACCOUNT FOR THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES WHEN </p><p>THE NOVEMBER 21 DEADLINE ARRIVES.  ALL OF THESE PROJECTS (IN </p><p>FAO\'S EYES) WILL BE COMPLETED OR NEARLY COMPLETED BY </p><p>NOVEMBER 21. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FAO IN BAGHDAD HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE </p><p>CPA IN BAGHDAD, BUT FOR THE NORTH, FAO IS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>DISCUSSION REGARDING THE PHASE-OVER FOR THE NORTHERN THREE </p><p>GOVERNORATES IS BEHIND SCHEDULE. FAO CURRENTLY HAS 40 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STAFF IN IRAQ, ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE </p><p>WORKING IN THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES. FAO HAS ABOUT </p><p>550 NATIONAL STAFF IN THE NORTH, MANY OF WHOM HAVE WORKED </p><p>FOR FAO SINCE 1997.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE 4,000-6,000 </p><p>CASUAL LABORERS WHO ALSO HAVE WORKED FAIRLY STEADILY FOR FAO </p><p>OVER THE YEARS.  FAO IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVISING A LAY-OFF </p><p>PLAN FOR THESE EMPLOYEES, BUT ANTICIPATES THAT THIS WILL NOT </p><p>BE EASY. </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003257  002 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) AFTER THE PASSING OF UNSC 1472 AND 1476, FAO REVIEWED </p><p>THE CONTRACTS THAT HAD BEEN LET BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ </p><p>FOR SOUTH/CENTRAL AND APPROVED BY OIP UNDER THE 59 PERCENT </p><p>ACCOUNT.  IN REVIEWING AND PRIORITIZING THE CONTRACTS, FAO </p><p>CHOSE THE ONES WHERE IT APPEARED THAT THE VENDOR COULD </p><p>DELIVER ON OR BEFORE JUNE 3 (THE ORIGINAL DATE OF THE </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE OFF PROGRAM) AND WHERE THE FUNDS HAD </p><p>    ALREADY BEEN PLACED INTO A LETTER OF CREDIT FROM OIP.  THESE </p><p>CONTRACTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY USD 185 MILLION.  MANY OF </p><p>THESE CONTRACTS ARE ALREADY IN THE EXECUTION STAGE; OTHERS </p><p>ARE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF NEGOTIATION. FAO IS SEIZED WITH </p><p>ENSURING THE TIMELY RECEIPT, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>THESE INPUTS, SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE CONTRACTS RELATED TO THIS USD 185 MILLION DO </p><p>NOT INCLUDE AGRICULTURAL PROVISIONS/SUPPLIES FOR THE FALL </p><p>AND WINTER.  FAO HAS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE LEAD TIME </p><p>REQUIRED TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES OF SEEDS, PESTICIDES AND </p><p>FUNGICIDES FOR CROPS, ANIMAL VACCINES, IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT, </p><p>ETC. FOR THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS AS WE NEAR THE FALL </p><p>PLANTING SEASON.  THIS CONCERN HAS LESSENED JUST RECENTLY </p><p>AS, IN THE LAST TEN DAYS, CPA ASKED FAO TO ASSUME USD 700 </p><p>MILLION WORTH OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDES THE </p><p>ABOVE ITEMS.  AND ON JULY 14, CPA TOLD FAO IT WOULD LIKE IT </p><p>(FAO) TO TAKE OVER ALL CONTRACTS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, </p><p>WHICH COULD AMOUNT TO AN ADDITIONAL USD HUNDREDS OF </p><p>MILLIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) NOTE: JUST AS WFP HAD TO DO FOR ALL THE CONTRACTS </p><p>FOR WHICH IT ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY, FAO WILL HAVE TO RE- </p><p>NEGOTIATE ALL THESE CONTRACTS.  IT IS A FORMIDABLE TASK AS </p><p>NO ONE CONTRACT IS SIMILAR TO ANOTHER.  EACH CARRIES ITS OWN </p><p>UNIQUE QUALITIES/PROBLEMS/CHALLENGES. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) IN THE PAST, IRAQ HAD SEVERAL OPERATIONAL </p><p>FERTILIZER FACTORIES IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS. </p><p>HISTORICALLY, IT DID NOT HAVE TO IMPORT FERTILIZER FOR THE </p><p>CROPPING SEASONS UNDER THE OFF PROGRAM.  AS, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>    FERTILIZER FACTORIES ARE PRESENTLY NON-OPERATIONAL, FAO </p><p>ASSERTS THAT FERTILIZER CONTRACTS NOW NEED TO BE ADDED TO </p><p>THE AGRICULTURAL IMPORT SUPPLY LIST.  FAO REPORTS THAT </p><p>JORDAN IS A LARGE PRODUCER OF FERTILIZER SO ACQUIRING IT IN </p><p>A TIMELY FASHION SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT, ONCE ANY CONTRACT </p><p>GOES THROUGH THE VARIOUS APPROVAL CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FAO LIAISON WITH CPA </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) ONE IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT OF ALL UN CONTRACTS IS </p><p>THAT THE VENDOR MUST BE ABLE TO DELIVER PRIOR TO NOVEMBER </p><p>21. FAO/HQ HAS ASKED ITS STAFF IN BAGHDAD TO RECEIVE IN </p><p>WRITING FROM THE CPA THAT IT WILL ASSUME THE FOLLOWING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES, WHEN GOODS ARRIVE: </p><p> </p><p>-PROVIDE SECURITY FROM THE BORDER POINT TO THE DELIVERY </p><p>POINT, AND IF NEEDED, AT THE DELIVERY POINT; </p><p>-TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE GOODS AT THE DELIVERY POINT AND DO </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003257  003 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>STRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) FAO IS POSITIVE ABOUT ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CPA IN </p><p>BAGHDAD, BUT STRESSES THAT A CPA AGRICULTURE LIAISON IS </p><p>URGENTLY NEEDED IN THE NORTH.  FAO FEELS THAT CPA WILL HAVE </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE AT A HIGH LEVEL FOR A </p><p>    LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN IT (CPA) MAY CURRENTLY </p><p>ANTICIPATE, INCLUDING IN THE NORTH, EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER </p><p>REGION IS ADMITTEDLY NOT AS "NEEDY" AS THE REST OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) ON JULY 14, AMBASSADOR DAN AMSTUTZ, THE CPA SENIOR </p><p>ADVISOR FOR AGRICULTURE, COMMUNICATED WITH THE FAO/HQ\'S </p><p>LAURENT THOMAS, RELATED TO HOW CPA SEES FAO\'S EVOLVING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  NOTE: THOMAS IS QUITE POSITIVE ON </p><p>AMBASSADOR AMSTUTZ\'S FORMIDABLE AGRICULTURAL CREDENTIALS AND </p><p>"TAKE-CHARGE" QUALITIES. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>FAO PREPARATIONS FOR THE OCTOBER DONOR CONFERENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) FAO, UNDP AND THE WORLD BANK HAVE NOW COMMENCED AN </p><p>OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE IRAQI AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR THE DONORS MEETING ON IRAQ TO BE HELD THIS </p><p>OCTOBER.  THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE ASSESSMENT IS TO BE </p><p>COMPLETED BY AUGUST 15. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) FAO HAS ALSO PREPARED THE FOLLOWING FINAL DRAFT </p><p>WORKING DOCUMENTS ON THE NORTHERN IRAQ AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, </p><p>AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>A) THREE-VOLUMES, RELEASED IN JUNE 2003: </p><p> </p><p>-    SCR 9686 - THREE-YEAR AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM IN THE IRAQI </p><p>  NORTHERN GOVERNORATES - MAIN REPORT & ANNEXES 1 TO 6 </p><p>-    ANNEX 7 TO THE MAIN REPORT </p><p>    -    TEN WORKING PAPERS (VOLUME 3); AND </p><p> </p><p>B) FOUR-VOLUMES, RELEASED IN JULY 2003: </p><p> </p><p>-PROJECT PROFILES - COMPONENT 1 (VOLUME 4 OF 6) (PART A); </p><p>-PROJECT PROFILES - COMPONENT 2 (VOLUME 4 OF 6) (PART B); </p><p>-PROJECT PROFILES - COMPONENT 3 (VOLUME 5 OF 6); AND </p><p>-PROJECT PROFILES - COMPONENTS 4 AND 5 (VOLUME 6 OF 6). </p><p> </p><p>NOTE. HARD COPIES OF A COMPLETE SET OF THESE REPORTS HAVE </p><p>BEEN FEDEXED TO MARY T. CHAMBLISS, DA/EC/USDA/FAS. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) FAO HAS AT PRESENT A LARGE AND HEAVY PORTFOLIO - </p><p>HELPING SALVAGE THE CURRENT HARVEST BY ACTING AS THE BARLEY </p><p>BUYER OF "LAST RESORT;" ACQUIRING FERTILIZER AND PESTICIDES </p><p>IN AMPLE AND TIMELY QUANTITIES; ENSURING THAT THERE IS SEED </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003257  004 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>ENT REGIONWIDE SPREAD OF </p><p>DISEASE; TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REHABILITATION OF </p><p>IRRIGATION WORKS; FRUIT TREE AND POULTRY REVIVAL; AND SO ON. </p><p>TO KEEP THE TURNOVER TIMETABLE ON-TRACK, DAILY DIALOGUE WILL </p><p>BE NEEDED BOTH IN BAGHDAD AND IN THE NORTH. FAO NEITHER </p><p>WANTS TO PROCEED AT THIS STAGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH CPA NOR TO BE ACCUSED OF NOT MOVING SWIFTLY ENOUGH TO </p><p>MAKE THE TRANSITION "HAPPEN" BY THE UNSCR-IMPOSED NOVEMBER </p><p>21 DEADLINE. US MISSION SHARES FAO\'S VIEW THAT CFA DEPLOY </p><p>SOONEST A SENIOR AGRICULTURE OFFICER TO THE NORTHERN 3 </p><p>GOVENORATES TO WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH FAO TO "GUARANTEE" THE </p><p>    PHASE-OVER. </p><p> </p><p>15.
