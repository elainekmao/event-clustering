<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Powell faces more protests on </p><p>      return to Africa" the August 22 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" carried </p><p>      the following opinion piece by Tim Chigodo on </p><p>      page 11: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "U. S. Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell is </p><p>      returning to Africa, a continent he despises. </p><p>      Mr. Powell who is well known for his anti- </p><p>      African views will head the U. S. delegation to </p><p>      the 10-day World Summit on Sustainable </p><p>      Development (WSSD) starting August 26 in place </p><p>      of President George W. Bush who has skipped the </p><p>      meeting. . .  Since assuming America\'s top and </p><p>      powerful foreign post, the Gulf war veteran has </p><p>      made more enemies in Africa than anywhere else </p><p>      in the world. . .  He faces more protests on his </p><p>      return. . .  The U. S. Secretary of State has </p><p>      never had love for Africa and would therefore be </p><p>      the least expected to say anything positive </p><p>      about the continent and its leaders. . .  While </p><p>      Mr. Powell has been criticized as an Uncle Tom, </p><p>      President Mugabe is revered the world over for </p><p>      he has fought colonialism and refuses to be </p><p>      cowed down by super powers.  To black people he </p><p>      is symbol of strength.  Mr. Powell does not </p><p>      understand Africa that he denigrates and </p><p>      therefore cannot be expected to help the </p><p>      continent solve its many problems. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
