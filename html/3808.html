ROME 4625 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 4484 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04668  01 OF 02  251804Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINCOUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN HIS PRESENTATIONS BEFORE PARLIAMENT, </p><p>ITALY\'S PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES, UNDERSCORED THE THREAT FROM IRAQ\'S </p><p>WEAPONS CAPABILITIES, AND NOTED THAT MULTILATERAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE EFFECTIVE IN ORDER TO KEEP INDIVIDUAL </p><p>COUNTRIES FROM ACTING UNILATERALLY.  THE GOVERNING COALITION </p><p>IS LINED UP SQUARELY BEHIND THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MAINTAINS ITS RESERVATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE NEED TO </p><p>AVOID UNILATERAL ACTION, WITH PUBLIC STATEMENTS HEAVY ON THE </p><p>NEED TO "PREVENT WAR" AND NEGATIVE ON POTENTIAL ITALIAN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT.  PRIVATELY, THE MORE CENTRIST ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ARE PREPARED TO CONCEDE THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION -- UNDER UN AUSPICES.  EMBASSY </p><p>CONTINUES TO HIGHLIGHT THE NATURE OF THE THREAT TO CONTACTS </p><p>BOTH IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE OPPOSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI PRESENTED THE GOI POSITION </p><p>ON IRAQ TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AT 10:30 A.M. ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>25 AND TO THE SENATE AT 4:30 P.M. THE SAME DAY.  HIS SPEECH </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT EFFECTIVE MULTILATERAL ACTION COULD PRECLUDE </p><p>THE NEED FOR UNILATERAL ACTION BY THE USG.  THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER MADE CLEAR THAT THE THREAT POSED BY SADDAM HUSSEIN </p><p>AND HIS WMD IS REAL:  IT IS "A REGIME THAT THREATENS TO USE </p><p>DREADFUL CHEMICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT COULD LEAD </p><p>TO DRAMATIC EVENTS."  BERLUSCONI EMPHASIZED THAT ITALY, ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS, MUST WORK WITH EUROPE </p><p>AND THE UNITED STATES TO ELIMINATE THE IRAQI THREAT AND IRAQI </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND TO ENSURE A STRONG, DETAILED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04668  01 OF 02  251804Z </p><p>CLEAR UN RESOLUTION DEFINING CONDITIONS FOR THE "MEASURED USE </p><p>OF FORCE" IN CASE OF A NEW IRAQI CHALLENGE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE HISTORICAL </p><p>COST OF INACTION AS "INCALCULABLE."  THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE, </p><p>THEREFORE, IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A COALITION CAPABLE OF </p><p>IMPOSING ON IRAQ RESPECT FOR A NEW, STRONG, CLEAR AND </p><p>PRESSING UN RESOLUTION.  REFERRING TO ITALY\'S CONSTITUTION, </p><p>BERLUSCONI SAID "ITALY REPUDIATES WAR AS AN OFFENSIVE </p><p>INSTRUMENT," BUT ADDED THAT PREVENTION IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOVERNING COALITION LINED UP BEHIND THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER.  MEETING WITH THE DCM AWAY FROM THE DEBATE, CHAMBER </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN GUSTAVO SELVA (NATIONAL </p><p>ALLIANCE, AN) SAID HIS DEFENSE COMMITTEE COUNTERPART, LUIGI </p><p>RAMPONI (AN), WAS TAKING THE SAME POSITION AS THE PM IN THE </p><p>CHAMBER EVEN AS SELVA AND THE DCM MET (REF A).  FERDINANDO </p><p>ADORNATO, CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER\'S CULTURE AND SCIENCE </p><p>COMMITTEE AND FORMER PARTY SPOKESMAN, WOULD SPEAK FOR </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S FORZA ITALIA (FI) PARTY.  "WE WILL NOT LEAVE THE </p><p>U.S. ALONE," SELVA ASSURED US. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES, NOT SURPRISINGLY, </p><p>OPPOSED BERLUSCONI\'S STATEMENT.  MARGHERITA (DAISY) PARTY </p><p>PRESIDENT FRANCESCO RUTELLI SAID THERE WAS NO SPACE FOR A </p><p>UNILATERAL SOLUTION IN EITHER WAR OR PEACE.  NOTHING CAN </p><p>SUBSTITUTE FOR UN LEGITIMACY, AND A U.S. DECISION CANNOT </p><p>AUTOMATICALLY BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL OR ITALIAN ONE.  LIKE </p><p>DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT (DS) REPRESENTATIVES, RUTELLI </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR ITALY TO WORK WITH ITS EUROPEAN </p><p>ALLIES.  (RUTELLI ADDED "AND AMERICA.")  DS SECRETARY PIERO </p><p>FASSINO RHETORICALLY ASKED BERLUSCONI:  WHAT CONSEQUENCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04668  01 OF 02  251804Z </p><p>WOULD WAR HAVE FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN WESTERN AND ISLAMIC </p><p>SOCIETIES?  WHAT REPLY COULD ITALY EXPECT IN THE WAY OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS?  WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST?  FASSINO SAID THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE SHOWED </p><p>THAT ITALY SHOULD DO ALL IN ITS POWER TO AVOID WAR.  DS </p><p>PRESIDENT MASSIMO D\'ALEMA ACCUSED BERLUSCONI OF BEING NOT AN </p><p>ALLY OF, BUT SUBSERVIENT TO, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.  IN </p><p>KOSOVO, HE SAID, THERE WAS THE NEED TO DEFEND CIVILIANS WHO </p><p>WERE THREATENED AND EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES.  IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A TERRORIST PRESENCE AND </p><p>THE WORLD ACTED IN CONFORMITY WITH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMIZATION.  NOW, HE CONTINUED, ITALY IS CONFRONTED WITH </p><p>THE IDEA OF A PREVENTIVE WAR, WITH PROPOSED ACTION OUTSIDE </p><p>THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY.  D\'ALEMA </p><p>INACCURATELY ACCUSED BERLUSCONI OF FAILING EVEN TO MENTION </p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION IN HIS REMARKS.  THE GREENS, COMMUNIST </p><p>RENEWAL, AND THE ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ALL CRITICIZED THE </p><p>SPEECH, AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  PUBLIC REMARKS FROM THE OPPOSITION ARE MORE STRIDENT </p><p>THAN THOSE THEY MAKE TO US IN PRIVATE.  POLMINCOUNS MET </p><p>SEPARATELY WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY SPOKESPEOPLE ON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8641 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04668  02 OF 02  251805Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------ECD059  251805Z /45 </p><p>O 251713Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6010 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, MARR, IZ, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON IRAQ:  BERLUSCONI </p><p>UNDERSCORES ALLIANCE WITH U.S. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS FOR THE DAISY AND DS PARTIES THE </p><p>MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 25.  BOTH WERE WILLING TO LISTEN TO U.S. </p><p>VIEWS AND FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO PREVENT ANTI-WAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04668  02 OF 02  251805Z </p><p>ARGUMENTS FROM BECOMING ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC.  BOTH STRONGLY </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE IMPERATIVE FOR UN SUPPORT FOR ANY ACTION IN </p><p>IRAQ.  DAISY REPRESENTATIVE LAPO PISTELLI WAS MORE </p><p>FORWARD-LEANING AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT UN WEAKNESS COULD FORCE </p><p>A U.S. REACTION.  DS REP MARINA SERENI WAS LESS WILLING TO </p><p>CONCEDE THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR MILITARY INTERVENTION AND THE </p><p>FACT THAT IRAQ HELD THE KEY FOR PREVENTING IT.  EACH MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT BAGHDAD HAD ZERO CREDIBILITY WITH THE ITALIAN </p><p>LEFT.  HOWEVER, EACH SAID THAT THE USG SEEMED TO BE </p><p>UNDERESTIMATING THE NEGATIVE REGIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF U.S. </p><p>MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISER, </p><p>PAOLO DIONISI, TOLD DCM AND POLMINCOUNS THE AFTERNOON OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 25 THAT BERLUSCONI WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH HIS </p><p>STATEMENT BEFORE PARLIAMENT AND WITH THOSE MADE BY HIS </p><p>COALITION PARTNERS.  DIONISI THOUGHT OPPOSITION REACTION WAS </p><p>PREDICTABLE AND MANAGEABLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  IN HIS SPEECH, BERLUSCONI DID A SOLID JOB </p><p>IN CONTINUING TO LAY THE GROUND TO BRING PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>BEHIND HIM IF THE U.S. CALLS ON ITALY TO SUPPORT ACTION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ (REF B).  HE URGED INTERNATIONAL ACTION, BUT </p><p>UNDERSCORED SUCH ACTION MUST BE STRONG, CLEAR, DECISIVE -- </p><p>AND BACKED BY THE WILLINGNESS TO USE FORCE.  HIS COALITION IS </p><p>SUPPORTING THE PM IN HIS EFFORTS TO BRING THE ITALIAN PUBLIC </p><p>ALONG.  OPPOSITION INSISTENCE ON A UN IMPRIMATUR, HOWEVER, IS </p><p>ALSO A VERY REAL REFLECTION OF PUBLIC OPINION HERE.  EVEN </p><p>ITALIANS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT WE MUST ACT AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>UNDERSCORE THAT ACTION UNDER A UN UMBRELLA IS FAR PREFERABLE </p><p>TO ACTION ALONE OR BY ONLY A FEW.

IF AND WHEN THE TIME </p><p>COMES, BERLUSCONI WILL DO HIS UTMOST TO HELP AND SUPPORT THE </p><p>USG, BUT HIS ABILITY TO ACT WILL BE CONSIDERABLY RESTRICTED </p><p>ABSENT A UN MANDATE, OR AT LEAST A BROAD AND COHESIVE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COALITION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04668 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
