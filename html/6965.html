<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001910 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Front pages of all papers published today, March </p><p>31, continue to focus on developments in the war in </p><p>Iraq.  Major reports highlight the effect of the </p><p>suicide bombings, a "division" in the Pentagon over </p><p>the military operations, as well as the continued </p><p>Iraqi resistance and the continued American and </p><p>British bombing of Baghdad and Basra.  A banner </p><p>headline in Al-Arab Al-Yawm reads "Four Thousand Arab </p><p>Would-Be Martyrs [suicide bombers] for Iraq".  Al-Arab </p><p>Al-Yawm also carries the text of a letter sent to the </p><p>King by 99 well-known Jordanian former officials and </p><p>others urging him to adopt a stand in defense of the </p><p>Iraqi people.  Covers of all Jordan\'s dailies feature </p><p>above-the-fold photographs of civilian-area </p><p>destruction or armed coalition forces searching Iraqi </p><p>civilians. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "An unclean war" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(03/31):  "To begin, it is an illegitimate and an </p><p>unjust war, and it is a war by the armies of </p><p>superpowers against a small third world country.. </p><p>Bush and Rumsfeld are trying to keep under cover the </p><p>war\'s developments so that their crimes stay in the </p><p>dark..  There were bloodbaths in Baghdad and Basra </p><p>where children, men and women became human pieces. </p><p>That is why Rumsfeld gave strict orders to the </p><p>American media not to publish any photos of the crimes </p><p>being perpetrated against humanity..  Yet, blood is </p><p>thicker than water.  Al-Jazira and other satellite </p><p>televisions covered the atrocities of Rumsfeld\'s dirty </p><p>war..  The least an Arab can do is not to keep quiet </p><p>about the brutality of the American-British </p><p>aggression.  The least we can do is to pursue the war </p><p>leaders with their daily crimes and atrocities against </p><p>the Iraqi people in order to expose them and put an </p><p>end to them.  If the media is silent about a crime, it </p><p>becomes as good as a supporter and an accessory." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Smart weapons and stupid policies" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/31):  "This unjust war launched by Washington and </p><p>London against Iraq is not aimed to disarm Iraq\'s non- </p><p>existent weapons of mass destruction, nor is it to </p><p>fight terrorism or to spread freedom and democracy. </p><p>All these are mere fabricated pretexts.  This war is </p><p>being waged for the sake of Israel, the oil and </p><p>controlling the region.  This war is being waged with </p><p>smart weapons but with stupid policies.  This campaign </p><p>of aggression is going to mark the beginning of the </p><p>end of the America as the sole world superpower, just </p><p>as the colonialist British empire ended following its </p><p>aggression against in Egypt in 1956 and just as the </p><p>Soviet Union collapsed with the failure of its </p><p>campaign in Afghanistan..  We had imagined that the </p><p>Anglo-American axis would secure a military victory </p><p>but suffer a political defeat.  The surprise is that </p><p>the military victory has not been achieved and the </p><p>political defeat is being confirmed day in and day </p><p>out..  What is required is to stop this crazy war now. </p><p>It is a war that is costing Iraq and is incurring </p><p>major losses for America and its allies.  There is </p><p>still an opportunity for an acceptable peaceful </p><p>solution that saves face for all parties." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Civil Jihad [non-violence] against the United </p><p>States" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/31):  "We all feel much hatred for American </p><p>policies.  We do not care about diplomatic or trade </p><p>relations when the American army is committing </p><p>monstrous massacres in Iraq.  Yes, we feel severe </p><p>hatred and we are thinking of all possible means by </p><p>which we can respond against the American aggression. </p><p>The problem with the introverted, government- </p><p>suppressed Arab societies is that they either resort </p><p>to random military retaliation, which directs feelings </p><p>of hatred in the incorrect direction, or they give up </p><p>and war and aggression become just another </p><p>`consumption method\'..  Jihad is not just a military </p><p>form, because not all Muslims have the capability to </p><p>fight or use weapons..  The interesting thing is that </p><p>the concept of `Jihad\' is applied in the West and its </p><p>societies that are more open-minded than the Arab and </p><p>Muslim societies, because the latter simply has no </p><p>concept of the idea of a civil society..  Civil Jihad </p><p>includes many options such as the boycott of American </p><p>commodities, strikes, and civil disobedience..  The </p><p>Jihad against the United States and against its </p><p>invasion of Iraq, its occupation of Iraq\'s territory, </p><p>stealing Iraq\'s resources, killing Iraq\'s people, is a </p><p>required and a legitimate Jihad.  It is not only a </p><p>military action, rather it includes a number of </p><p>peaceful and civil actions that would work to change </p><p>the feelings of hatred into effective actions against </p><p>the American invasion on all political, civil, </p><p>economic, cultural and socials levels." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The future is bleak" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the back-page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/31):  "The coalition media is engaging in what we </p><p>used to think are special characteristics of the Arab </p><p>media alone:  lying through the teeth, taking sides, </p><p>and thwarting its professionalism and credibility.. </p><p>It is shameful that this media cannot find anything </p><p>other than the image of the British soldier giving an </p><p>Iraqi child in Umm Qasr some chocolates as proof of </p><p>`the humanity of the war, its legitimacy and its </p><p>cleanliness\'.  This media is ignoring the horrific </p><p>images of the civilian victims of the markets in </p><p>Baghdad, Mosul and Basra, and ignores the images of </p><p>the dead and the wounded of the allied forces.  We </p><p>used to not believe the Iraqi official media - and the </p><p>media in Iraq is all official, its credibility shaken </p><p>and its performance desperate - yet, in this war, we </p><p>are not looking for the truth in the stories of </p><p>western media, because they too have become involved </p><p>in lies and misinformation." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
