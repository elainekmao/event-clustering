PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU)  The Canadian Radio-Television and </p><p>Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) concluded in a January </p><p>17, 2003 report that there is no need to amend its current </p><p>New Media Exemption Order.  This decision upholds the intent </p><p>of Bill C-11, passed in December 2002 (Reftel), making it </p><p>illegal to put broadcast TV signals onto the Internet </p><p>without permission.  The decision is a victory for U.S. and </p><p>Canadian broadcasters who have worked for more than three </p><p>years to outlaw non-consensual Internet retransmission in </p><p>Canada.  The complete text of the CRTC decision is available </p><p>on the web at: </p><p>www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/2003/pb200 3-2.htm. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Bill C-11, which amended Canada\'s compulsory licensing </p><p>regime specifically to disallow the retransmission of </p><p>television signals over the Internet, was tied to the CRTC\'s </p><p>New Media Exemption Order.  During the debate on Bill C-11, </p><p>the CRTC was ordered to review the Exemption Order. </p><p>Internet retransmissions would have been eligible for the </p><p>benefits of the compulsory license in the Copyright Act if </p><p>the CRTC had decided either to license them as broadcasters </p><p>or to create a new exemption order specifically for them. </p><p>The CRTC chose to do neither. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Canadian legal experts told Econoff that the CRTC </p><p>decision, combined with the contents of C-11, provides an </p><p>absolute exclusion of Internet retransmitters from the </p><p>Canadian compulsory license for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Bill C-11, which was proclaimed into law in December but is </p><p>not yet in force, is expected to enter into force as law </p><p>next month. </p><p> </p><p>4.   In a separate but related development, Aliant, a </p><p>Maritime phone consortium, filed an application with the </p><p>CRTC for an experimental license to continue its Internet </p><p>retransmission service.  Aliant\'s filing was made before the </p><p>CRTC handed down its recent decision so it is expected that </p><p>the CRTC will deny the application and Aliant\'s subscriber </p><p>service, "TV-On-My-PC", will have to cease operations. </p><p>However, we will continue to follow the issue and report any </p><p>findings that would be of concern to U.S. interests. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
