<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 00858 </p><p> </p><p>ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, IR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAIT MFA OFFICIAL ON IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  MFA UNDER SECRETARY SULAIMAN MAJED </p><p>AL-SHAHEEN FEBRUARY 4 TOLD STATE/CENTCOM BRIEFING TEAM </p><p>IRAN NO LONGER SHOWED OPEN INTEREST IN SHIA ON THE ARAB </p><p>SIDE OF THE GULF, BUT MAINTAINED ITS CONTACTS THROUGH </p><p>"OTHER ORGANIZATIONS".  KUWAIT HAS ACCEPTED AN IRANIAN </p><p>ENVOY, BUT IS RELUCTANT TO RESTORE AIR LINKS.  SHAHEEN </p><p>SAID IRAN STILL HOLDS ABOUT 92 KUWAITI SMALL CRAFT </p><p>SEIZED FROM FISHERMEN AND PLEASURE BOATERS.  HE HOPES </p><p>FOR NORMALIZATION OF SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS, BUT SAID </p><p>THE EXECUTION OF 16 KUWAITI SHIA AFTER LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>MECCA BOMBINGS HAD HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT BECAUSE TEHRAN </p><p>STILL HELD ITSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR "SHIA BLOOD".  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  STATE/CENTCOM BRIEFING TEAM LED BY BRIG. GEN. </p><p>DREWFS FEBRUARY 4 PROVIDED BRIEFING ON IRAN TO MFA </p><p>UNDER SECRETARY SULAIMAN MAJED AL-SHAHEEN.  THE MEETING </p><p>WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY MFA AMERICAS DEPARTMENT CHIEF DR. </p><p>SUHAIL SHUHAIBER, TWO OTHER MFA STAFFERS, DCM, CHUSLOK, </p><p>AND POLCHIEF.  SHAHEEN LISTENED CAREFULLY, ASKED A </p><p>NUMBER OF QUESTIONS, AND AT THE CONCLUSION EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE BRIEFING.  HE TERMED IT A "SIGN OF </p><p>THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN KUWAIT AND THE US" AND ASSURED </p><p>THE BRIEFERS THAT "THE MAIN POINTS WILL FIND THEIR WAY </p><p>TO HIGHER AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER (SHAIKH SABAH AL-AHMED, WHO DOUBLES AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER)". </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHAHEEN OFFERED THE TEAM KUWAIT\'S PERSPECTIVE ON </p><p>IRANIAN DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL.  COMMENTING ON </p><p>RAFSANJANI\'S HOLD ON POWER, HE SAID IT WAS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>TELL IF RAFSANJANI WAS STRONG OR HIS OPPONENTS WERE </p><p>WEAK.  AHMED KHOMEINI CLEARLY HAD LITTLE REAL POWER </p><p>EXCEPT THE REFLECTED INFLUENCE OF HIS NAME, AND </p><p>APPEARED TO BE CONCENTRATING NOW ON RELIGIOUS ISSUES </p><p>(SUCH AS BUILDING HIS FATHER\'S SHRINE) RATHER THAN </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE UNDER SECRETARY SAID KUWAIT HAD INFORMATION </p><p>THAT THE IRANIANS HAD BEGUN A CAMPAIGN (NOT WITH </p><p>SUCCESS TO DATE) TO CONVINCE IRANIAN INTELLECTUALS AND </p><p>TECHNOCRATS IN EUROPE AND THE US TO RETURN.  ON IRAN\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARDS ITS GULF NEIGHBORS, HE SAID ALTHOUGH </p><p>TEHRAN NO LONGER OPENLY SHOWED INTEREST IN THE SHIA OF </p><p>THE GULF, IT LIKELY WAS WORKING THROUGH "OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS" TO KEEP TIES WITH THE SHIA ON THE ARAB </p><p>SIDE OF THE GULF.  ON SAUDI-IRANIAN TIES, HE SAID </p><p>KUWAIT HOPED RELATIONS WOULD BE NORMALIZED BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRANIANS </p><p>"STILL HOLD THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR SHIA BLOOD" AND </p><p>SAID THE SAUDIS\' EXECUTION OF 16 KUWAITI SHIA AFTER THE </p><p>MECCA BOMBINGS LAST JULY HAD AFFECTED SAUDI-IRANIAN </p><p>RELATIONS.  HE CITED THE KILLING OF THREE SAUDI </p><p>DIPLOMATS IN THAILAND IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON KUWAIT\'S OWN RELATIONS WITH IRAN, HE RECALLED </p><p>THAT AN IRANIAN AMBASSADOR HAD RECENTLY TAKEN UP HIS </p><p>POSITION IN KUWAIT AND THAT KUWAIT HAD A CHARGE IN </p><p>TEHRAN.  HE DID NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF </p><p>WHETHER/WHEN A KUWAITI AMBASSADOR MIGHT GO TO IRAN. </p><p>SHAHEEN SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE "STILL TALKING" ON </p><p>THE ISSUE OF AIR LINKS, BUT THE GOK FEELS "THE AIRSPACE </p><p>IS STILL NOT CLEAR".  THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS AS </p><p>WELL ON WHICH THE GOK HAD NOT HAD A CLEAR ANSWER FROM </p><p>TEHRAN.  HE SAID THE IRANIANS WERE HOLDING ABOUT 92 </p><p>SMALL BOATS, INCLUDING FISHING BOATS AND SPEEDBOATS. </p><p>OFTEN, HE SAID, THE BOAT WOULD BE SEIZED AND THE </p><p>FISHERMEN, USUALLY EGYPTIANS, RELEASED.  SHAHEEN SAID </p><p>THE TEHRAN GOVERNMENT SAYS IT DOESN\'T KNOW ABOUT THE </p><p>BOAT SEIZURES "AND WE BELIEVE THEM".  HE SAID THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LIKELY DID NOT CONTROL THE ACTIONS </p><p>OF LOCAL COAST GUARD COMMANDERS.  THIS EVIDENT LACK OF </p><p>CENTRAL AUTHORITY WAS ITSELF A VERY WORRYING SIGN OF </p><p>RAFSANJANI\'S ABILITY, OR LACK THEREOF, TO ESTABLISH </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT.  SHAHEEN\'S REMARK ABOUT IRAN MAINTAINING </p><p>ITS TIES TO SHIA THROUGH "OTHER ORGANIZATIONS" BETRAYS </p><p>CONTINUING GOK CONCERN ABOUT TEHRAN\'S MISCHIEF-MAKING </p><p>ABILITY, DESPITE A THAW IN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  "OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS" LIKELY MEANS CLANDESTINE SHIA </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  THE REFERENCE TO THE 16 KUWAITI SHIA </p><p>ALSO REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT\'S KEEN AWARENESS THAT THE </p><p>UPS AND DOWNS IN SAUDI-IRANIAN TIES HAVE AN IMPACT </p><p>HERE.  AS LONG AS THAT RELATIONSHIP IS POOR, IT WILL </p><p>LIMIT TO SOME EXTENT THE SPEED WITH WHICH KUWAIT CAN </p><p>IMPROVE ITS OWN RELATIONS WITH TEHRAN -- WHICH, ALL </p><p>THINGS BEING EQUAL, KUWAIT WOULD LIKE TO DO.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
