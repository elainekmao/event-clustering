<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000536 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3-28-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KJUS, SOCI, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court rules that </p><p>December 2001 election was unfair for many Tamils </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 485; (B) Colombo 147 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court ruled March 25 </p><p>that the previous government violated the fundamental </p><p>rights of numerous Tamils by preventing them from voting </p><p>in the December 2001 general election.  Human rights </p><p>activists applauded the ruling, stating that it set a </p><p>precedent for freer-and-fairer elections in the future. </p><p>Observers believe that the surprise ruling is a </p><p>political black eye for the People\'s Alliance (PA) and </p><p>the radical JVP, which were in power at the time.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In a dramatic ruling, the Supreme Court announced </p><p>March 25 that the fundamental rights of voters in the </p><p>north and east were violated when they were not </p><p>permitted to vote in the December 2001 general election. </p><p>Agreeing with the case presented by the Tamil </p><p>plaintiffs, the court ruled specifically that the Sri </p><p>Lankan military, acting on orders from the PA-Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) government then in power, </p><p>prevented Tamils in the Vavunia and Batticaloa areas </p><p>from passing through military check points in order to </p><p>vote.  (Note:  Accounts by election observers placed the </p><p>numbers of Tamils prevented from voting that day in the </p><p>north and east in the tens of thousands -- please also </p><p>see the 2001 human rights report for Sri Lanka.)  The </p><p>Court also held that VIPs in the government (including </p><p>the president and several of her key ministers) were </p><p>given special treatment and allowed to vote illegally </p><p>before the election. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) As for its remedy, the court allowed that there </p><p>could be no vote recount at this point, but it fined Sri </p><p>Lanka Army Commander Lt. General L. Balagalle, then- </p><p>Commissioner of Elections D. Dissanayake, and the </p><p>government a total of 391,000 Sri Lankan Rupees </p><p>(approximately USD 4,100) each for their roles in </p><p>mismanaging the election.  From what Mission understands </p><p>(with the proviso that it is sometimes very difficult to </p><p>understand Sri Lanka\'s almost Dickensian legal system), </p><p>the case cannot be appealed. (Note:  The ruling was made </p><p>by a three-justice bench of the 11-member Supreme Court. </p><p>The bench was apparently acting with full-and-plenary </p><p>powers.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Human rights observers were pleased with the </p><p>ruling, hoping that it would set a precedent for freer- </p><p>and-fairer elections in the future.  Kingsley Rodrigo, </p><p>the head of PAFFREL, a well-known local NGO involved in </p><p>election monitoring, told us that the ruling showed that </p><p>the oft-criticized Supreme Court can act in a decisive </p><p>fashion and in the public interest.  He hoped the ruling </p><p>would have a positive impact on proposed local elections </p><p>in the north and east which might take place later this </p><p>year.  (Note:  Per Ref A, at the end of the recent sixth </p><p>round of peace talks, a joint statement was issued </p><p>stating that the Tigers would "favorably consider" </p><p>allowing local elections to be held in the north and </p><p>east, including, presumably, in Tiger-controlled areas.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Regarding potential political ramifications, </p><p>observers have told us that the ruling was a black eye </p><p>for the PA and the JVP (who are currently trying to </p><p>unite and form an alliance again).  Desmond Fernando, a </p><p>prominent lawyer and human rights advocate (with close </p><p>connections to the prime minister), told us that the </p><p>Supreme Court\'s decision was a huge embarrassment for </p><p>President Kumaratunga, the leader of the PA, and a blow </p><p>to her image as tolerant toward all communities. </p><p>Tamils, he commented, will be sure to view Kumaratunga </p><p>in an increasingly bad light, given that it was her </p><p>government that prevented members of their community </p><p>from voting.  (Note:  Re the December 2001 election, </p><p>Kumaratunga is also in some trouble from a different </p><p>angle.  Her close relative, former minister Anuruddha </p><p>Ratwatte, and two of his sons and 13 others, are </p><p>currently on trial for alleged involvement in the </p><p>slaying of ten Muslims on election day.) </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  The outcome of the case is clearly a </p><p>victory for Tamils and human rights advocates, who have </p><p>long fought for judicial acknowledgement of electoral </p><p>abuses.  The fact that individuals (Balagalle and </p><p>Dissanayake) were held directly responsible for their </p><p>actions was another small, but important, step in </p><p>overcoming Sri Lanka\'s history of impunity regarding </p><p>human rights matters.  On the political side, the ruling </p><p>was clearly a blow to the PA and JVP, including the </p><p>president herself.  The fact that the ruling emerged </p><p>from a court reportedly controlled by an ally of the </p><p>president\'s (Chief Justice Sarath Silva) was also a bit </p><p>of a surprise.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
