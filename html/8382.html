<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000998 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL - A/S CRANER, AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2015 </p><p>TAGS: Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL DEPORTS TIBETAN DETAINEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0997 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 144931 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 0991 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) In the early morning hours of May 31, Nepali </p><p>authorities handed over 18 Tibetan detainees (including 8 </p><p>minors) to representatives of the Chinese Embassy for </p><p>deportation.  As of 0915 local time, the Chinese Embassy </p><p>vehicle containing the 18 was reported heading toward the </p><p>Chinese border with a police escort.  UNHCR was denied access </p><p>to the detainees and to police officials.  Embassy efforts to </p><p>contact high-ranking officials at the Home Ministry and at </p><p>the police to avert the deportation proved fruitless.  At the </p><p>earliest possible opportunity, the Embassy will register with </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON) our protest at its violation of </p><p>international norms and practices.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AFTER-HOURS PAPERWORK </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  At about 6:00 p.m. local time on May 30, a white </p><p>van with a license plate identifying it as belonging to the </p><p>Chinese Embassy appeared at Hanuman Dhoka Jail, where 18 </p><p>Tibetan detainees (including 8 minors) had been moved the </p><p>previous day.  According to reports from the Office of Tibet, </p><p>two Chinese Embassy representatives emerged and went inside. </p><p>The Office of Tibet notified UNHCR, which sent two protection </p><p>officers to the jail.  The officers requested, but were </p><p>denied, access to the detainees and to police authorities. </p><p>The officers remained at the jail until about 9:00 p.m., </p><p>leaving after the Chinese Embassy representatives left.  The </p><p>UNHCR officers were advised to contact the Superintendent of </p><p>Police after 10:00 a.m. the following (Saturday) morning. </p><p>Wangchuk Tsering, from the Office of Tibet and the </p><p>representative of the Dalai Lama in Nepal, said he understood </p><p>a CNN news crew attempting to cover the story also was barred </p><p>from entering Hanuman Dhoka on the night of May 30.  Poloff </p><p>attempted to reach Home Ministry officials, including the </p><p>Home Secretary, at both their homes and offices for several </p><p>hours that night to no avail. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>AND EARLY-MORNING DEPARTURE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  At about 6:00 a.m. local time on May 31, Office of </p><p>Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering reported that the </p><p>Chinese Embassy van had reappeared at Hanuman Dhoka, along </p><p>with a second Chinese Embassy vehicle.  (Note:  Saturdays in </p><p>Nepal are like what Sundays in the U.S. used to be like, with </p><p>all government offices and most retail businesses closed. </p><p>End note.)  Tsering said he feared the police were preparing </p><p>to hand over the Tibetan detainees to the Chinese.  Poloff </p><p>called Home Secretary Tika Datta Niraula at home.  A male </p><p>answered the phone and hung up after she identified herself. </p><p>Repeated attempts to call back were met with a busy signal </p><p>(which continued for several hours).  She also attempted to </p><p>contact Ministry Joint Secretary Niranjan Baral at home at </p><p>6:00 a.m. and was told he was out.  Other attempts to call </p><p>back were also met with a busy signal.  Poloff consulted with </p><p>a UNHCR protection officer on next steps.  The officer said </p><p>she was planning to consult with Geneva shortly. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Tsering then reported that Office of Tibet members </p><p>observed the Tibetan detainees being taken out of the jail by </p><p>police, who were attempting to put them into the Chinese </p><p>Embassy van.  (Note:  They observed the scene from some </p><p>distance, as they were not allowed onto the compound.  End </p><p>note.)  When the detainees began screaming in protest, the </p><p>police loaded all 18 into a police vehicle, which proceeded, </p><p>followed by the Chinese van, to the Police Club grounds, </p><p>where the occupants reportedly were transferred to the </p><p>Chinese vehicle.  The Chinese vehicle (with its tell-tale </p><p>license plate now covered in paper) was proceeding toward the </p><p>Chinese border with a police escort, Tsering said. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>EMBASSY EFFORTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) When attempts to speak to authorities on the </p><p>telephone proved fruitless, charge went to Hanuman Dhoka Jail </p><p>to meet the police and try to avert the detainees\' </p><p>deportation.  Unfortunately, however, by the time he arrived </p><p>there around 8:00 a.m. (the jail is across town), the </p><p>detainees were already gone.  All of the officers on duty </p><p>claimed to have just begun their shifts, and professed </p><p>ignorance of the events.  Charge attempted to contact the </p><p>Superintendent of Police at his office, his home and on his </p><p>cell phone, but was unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In addition to delivering ref B demarche to the </p><p>Foreign Secretary and contacting Home Ministry officials (Ref </p><p>A), Embassy staff, including the Ambassador, have made a </p><p>number of other representations at high levels on behalf of </p><p>the Tibetan detainees.  On April 25 Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>spoke with the Home Secretary about the case, and again on </p><p>May 9 the Ambassador raised the Tibetans\' plight with the </p><p>King, who professed unawareness of the matter but undertook </p><p>to look into it.  On May 28 the Charge again raised the </p><p>matter with Prabhakar Rana, King Gyanendra\'s confidant and </p><p>business partner.  On May 29 Charge discussed the problem </p><p>with a prominent private American citizen, who reported that </p><p>he had also raised the subject with the King that day. </p><p>Charge spoke with Rana again on May 31 and asked him to </p><p>convey to the King USG concerns at the GON\'s apparent change </p><p>of policy with regard to Tibetans transiting Nepal.  Rana </p><p>said that he intends to make a detailed proposal to the King, </p><p>after researching the subject with the Tibetan community, </p><p>UNHCR, and others, to clarify the GON\'s position and to </p><p>formally revert to the past policy of turning over transiting </p><p>Tibetans to UNHCR.  Charge advised UNHCR of Rana\'s intent. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Home Ministry officials were aware of our (and EU </p><p>embassies\') concern and studiously avoided our efforts to </p><p>speak and/or meet with them all day May 30 and May 31.  The </p><p>decision to deport the Tibetans despite our repeated </p><p>representations presumably was taken at the very highest </p><p>levels of the GON, which made a calculation that the costs of </p><p>displeasing their giant northern neighbor on this issue far </p><p>outweighed the possible benefits of responding to the </p><p>concerns of the rest of the international community.  We find </p><p>it ironic that the GON has so obviously disregarded our </p><p>expressed views on this matter at the same time that it seems </p><p>to be responding positively to our pressure to broaden </p><p>representation in the interim government (Ref C).  We will </p><p>continue to press the GON through all appropriate channels to </p><p>reinstitute its former practice of turning over Tibetan </p><p>"persons of concern" to UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
