<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 003030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT AND AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ECON, ETTC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NASCO GROUP (NIGERIA) LIMITED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A)STATE 165061, B) STATE 10592, C0 ABUJA 187 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON </p><p>1.6X5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) During an October 10 conversation, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter informed National Security Advisor Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed that the NASCO parent company based in Turkey </p><p>and many of its subsidiaries and affiliate companies </p><p>have been jointly designated by the Italian and United </p><p>States governments as involved in terrorist financing. </p><p>The Ambassador stressed that NASCO had links to Al </p><p>Queda and other known terrorist organizations, thus </p><p>the basis for NASCO\'s designation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Ambassador Jeter told Mohammed that NASCO </p><p>subsidiaries in Nigeria were not yet designated. Given </p><p>the large role the NASCO group of companies plays in </p><p>the economy of Plateau State this was salutary </p><p>economically; moreover, the non-designation also </p><p>helped Nigeria politically. However, the Ambassador </p><p>emphasized the investigative process was not yet </p><p>complete. If the use of any of these subsidiaries for </p><p>terrorism financing were to be detected, the companies </p><p>would be swiftly quickly placed on the list. </p><p>Moreover, since many of the other NASCO companies were </p><p>now designated, NASCO principals might try to use the </p><p>non-designated companies in Nigeria to move money. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter advised Mohammed that Nigeria must be </p><p>extremely vigilant in watching these companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Mohammed stated that he clearly understood the </p><p>importance of this issue and would confer with the </p><p>Central Bank to establish a mechanism to strictly </p><p>monitor NASCO financial transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) we plan to get back to NSA Mohammed to inquire </p><p>what concrete actions have been taken and to ascertain </p><p>any findings thus far. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
