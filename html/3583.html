<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001948 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OF MEDIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The government-owned weekly "Sunday Mail" </p><p>      reported on August 25 that the government has </p><p>      introduced amendments to the controversial Access to </p><p>      Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) that </p><p>      will further tighten government control of the media. </p><p>      According to the news article, the Cabinet Committee </p><p>      on Legislation has already approved amendments to </p><p>      AIPPA.  The parliament will have to approve the </p><p>      amendments, but ruling party control of parliament </p><p>      makes that approval a formality. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Salient points of the amendments include: </p><p> </p><p>  -    Restricts public access to information by </p><p>     allowing the ".head of a public body to refuse to </p><p>     disclose to an applicant information, including </p><p>     personal information about the applicant, if the </p><p>     disclosure will result in a threat to another person\'s </p><p>     safety or mental or physical health." </p><p>  -    Exempts the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and </p><p>     ZIANA (the government-owned wire service) from the </p><p>     AIPPA-mandated media registration process. </p><p>  -    Limits the accreditation of foreign journalists </p><p>     in Zimbabwe to 30 days, rather than 12 months as </p><p>     permitted under the original law. </p><p>  -    Defines and expands the crime of "publishing </p><p>     falsehoods," giving courts clearer benchmarks for </p><p>     convictions or dismissals. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Excerpts of the article follow: </p><p> </p><p>     ". . .In his submissions to the committee, </p><p>     Chinamasa said the purpose of the Bill was to </p><p>     amend the AIPPA with a view to improving it and </p><p>     correcting certain anomalies and errors that have </p><p>     come to the attention of the ministry since the </p><p>     Act was promulgated.  The Bill seeks to repeal </p><p>     Section 22 of the Act and substitutes it with a </p><p>     new section that says: The head of a public body </p><p>     may refuse to disclose to an applicant </p><p>     information, including personal information about </p><p>     the applicant, if the disclosure will result in a </p><p>     threat to another person\'s safety or mental or </p><p>     physical health.  Section 35 of the Bill that </p><p>     deals with the penalty for deliberately </p><p>     falsifying personal information reads: `Any </p><p>     person who, when required under any enactment to </p><p>     supply to a public body any personal information </p><p>     verbally or in writing about himself or herself </p><p>     or a third party, supplies any information which </p><p>     he or she knows to be false or does not have </p><p>     reasonable grounds for believing to be true, </p><p>     shall be guilty of an offense and liable to a </p><p>     fine not exceeding level five or imprisonment for </p><p>     a period not exceeding six months or to both such </p><p>     fine and such imprisonment.\' </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The Bill seeks to exempt from registration </p><p>      `mass medium founded under an Act of Parliament, </p><p>      a mass media service consisting of the </p><p>      activities of a person holding a license issued </p><p>      in terms of the Broadcasting Services Act to the </p><p>      extent that such activities are permitted by </p><p>      such license or a representative office of a </p><p>      foreign mass media service permitted to operate </p><p>      in Zimbabwe in terms of Section 90.\'  Section 80 </p><p>      of the Bill reads: `A journalist who abuses his </p><p>      journalistic privilege by; (a) falsifying or </p><p>      maliciously or fraudulently fabricating </p><p>      information or; (b) publishing or reproducing </p><p>      any statement (i) knowing it to be false or </p><p>      without having reasonable grounds for believing </p><p>      it to be true; and (ii) recklessly, or with </p><p>      malicious or fraudulent intent, representing it </p><p>      as a true statement or; (c) committing or </p><p>      facilitating the commission of a criminal </p><p>      offense; `Shall be guilty of an offense and </p><p>      liable to a fine not exceeding level seven or to </p><p>      imprisonment for a period not exceeding two </p><p>      years.\' </p><p> </p><p>      "In its considerations, the committee said it </p><p>      felt that 12 months was `too long a period for </p><p>      the accreditation of a foreign journalists and </p><p>      advised that the period be reduced to 30 days." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Comment:  The original AIPPA was enacted early </p><p>      this year after significant parliamentary debate.  The </p><p>      Act established a Statutory Media Commission, which </p><p>      requires that all journalists apply for a one-year </p><p>      renewable license.  Media organizations (now excepting </p><p>      some state-owned media) must pay substantial </p><p>      registration fees and meet a stringent set of </p><p>      requirements before issuance of a license.  However, </p><p>      the license can be revoked at any time if for those </p><p>      who breach a planned code of conduct.  Since its </p><p>      enactment, more than a dozen local journalists, </p><p>      including an American citizen, have been arrested and </p><p>      tried for violating AIPPA.   Two separate legal </p><p>      challenges to AIPPA have been filed by journalists and </p><p>      will be heard later this year.  End comment. </p><p>  SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
