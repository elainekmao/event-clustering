<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000809 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/FO A/S KANSTEINER AND P/DAS BELLAMY AND </p><p>AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR ADVISER FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SF, NI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN PERSPECTIVE ON ZIMBABWE </p><p>FACILITATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH COMMISSIONER NDOU TOLD US MARCH </p><p>26 THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN/NIGERIAN FACILITATED TALKS </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOZ/ZANU-PF AND THE MDC WOULD BEGIN APRIL 2 </p><p>IN HARARE.  HE SAID THAT TALKS THUS FAR HAD BEEN HELD </p><p>SEPARATELY WITH THE TWO SIDES TO DISCUSS THE AGENDAS OF </p><p>THE TWO, BUT THAT FACE-TO-FACE TALKS WOULD BEGIN NEXT </p><p>TUESDAY.  HE STRESSED THAT THE SOUTH AFRICANS/NIGERIANS </p><p>WOULD NOT BE MEDIATING, BUT FACILITATING.  HE DISCOUNTED </p><p>ANY PROSPECT THAT THE WIDELY DIFFERING AGENDAS WOULD </p><p>PREVENT ANY SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT, SAYING THAT EVEN SOME </p><p>VENTING FROM BOTH SIDES WOULD BE USEFUL TO CLEAR THE </p><p>AIR.  NDOU SAID THAT THE AREAS TO BE DISCUSSED WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE PEACE AND STABILITY, THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND </p><p>LAND. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HC NDOU BELIEVED THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>REACH AGREEMENT RAPIDLY ON A NEW CONSTITUTION USING AS A </p><p>BASE THE CONSTITUTION REJECTED IN THE 2000 REFERENDUM, </p><p>AS COMPLEMENTED BY THE MANY PUBLIC DEBATES AND INPUTS </p><p>RECEIVED SUBSEQUENTLY.  (IRONICALLY, MDC FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>SPOKESMAN BITI MADE ALMOST THE SAME POINT TO US </p><p>RECENTLY, ALTHOUGH HE WOULD LIKELY WANT TO SEE THE </p><p>DRAFTING PROCESS DRIVEN BY CIVIL SOCIETY, NOT A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED SYSTEM.  NDOU ALSO BELIEVED THAT </p><p>THE GOZ WAS FAR MORE OPEN TO ECONOMIC REFORM THAN ITS </p><p>POST-ELECTIONS ACTIONS INDICATED.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ RECOGNIZED THE PROFUNDITY OF ITS ECONOMIC CRISIS, </p><p>BUT WOULD LEAVE SERIOUS ECONOMIC REFORM TO THE YET-TO-BE </p><p>DESIGNATED NEW CABINET. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00809  271510Z </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) NDOU SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT NEW ELECTIONS </p><p>COULD BE HELD NOW UNDER THE SAME POLARIZED CONDITIONS. </p><p>INSTEAD, ELECTIONS MUST COME AS THE RESULT OF AN </p><p>AGREEMENT TO BUILD PEACE AND STABILITY.  NDOU DECLINED </p><p>TO BLAME ZANU-PF FOR MOST OF THE POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE, </p><p>SAYING THERE WAS SOME VIOLENCE ON BOTH SIDES.  HE ALSO </p><p>DISAGREED THAT MUGABE WAS AT THE HEART OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS, SAYING IT WAS THE SYSTEM WHICH ENCOURAGED </p><p>VIOLENCE AND POLARIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE ANC SECRETARY-GENERAL WHO IS FACILITATING THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WILL BE JOINED NEXT WEEK BY SEVERAL </p><p>ASSISTANTS, BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING WITH THE </p><p>ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE HIGH COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) HC NDOU SAID THAT SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BE HELPING </p><p>THE GOZ MEET ITS FOOD NEEDS, BUT NOT WITH CREDITS OR </p><p>DONATIONS.  INSTEAD THE SAG WOULD HELP LOCATE GRAIN FOR </p><p>SALE AND SEEK TO OVERCOME TRANSPORTATION BOTTLENECKS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: THE SAG VIEW OF THESE TALKS WHICH HE </p><p>PROJECTS IS NOT OF PUTTING PRESSURE ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES </p><p>TO REACH AGREEMENT, BUT RATHER ACCOMPANYING THE PROCESS </p><p>UNTIL THEY AGREE ON KEY POINTS FOR RECONCILIATION.  WE </p><p>ARE DOUBTFUL THAT THE TWO PARTIES\' RADICALLY DIFFERENT </p><p>AGENDAS CAN BE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS READILY AS THE HC </p><p>SEEMS TO ASSUME.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>TO US THAT MUGABE WILL EMBRACE A MOVE FOR A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION IN THE HOPE THAT SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD </p><p>DEFLATE MOMENTUM FOR A NEW ELECTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00809  271510Z </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
