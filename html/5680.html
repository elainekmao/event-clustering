<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000301 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHER AMCIT PROPERTY FORMALLY SEIZED </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  A fourth American-owned property has now </p><p>received final notice of acquisition from the Minister of </p><p>Lands, Agriculture and Resettlement.  The other forcibly </p><p>acquired properties now occupy a limbo as their owners pursue </p><p>various legal challenges and political solutions.  Although </p><p>the most recently acquired property was purchased well after </p><p>independence and was designated as a "wildlife conservancy," </p><p>two categories which should have offered some protection, it </p><p>is unclear whether protests, legal challenges, or personal </p><p>relationships will be enough to return possession of the </p><p>property to the Amcit title holders.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The Zimbabwean property belonging to two American </p><p>citizens, Sam and Janet Chambliss, was served with a Section </p><p>8 notice, or Final Notice of Acquisition, on January 26, </p><p>2003.  The Chamblisses bought their property in 1985, and </p><p>after investing close to US $750,000, they formally </p><p>incorporated the property as a wildlife conservancy under </p><p>Zimbabwe law in 1993.  Approximately fifteen separate farms </p><p>in the Midlands province were served with Section 8 notices </p><p>that same weekend, despite the GOZ\'s oft-repeated claim last </p><p>November and December that "the land resettlement program is </p><p>now complete."  Post responded, as we have for other American </p><p>citizens in similar situations, with a diplomatic note of </p><p>protest addressed to the Foreign Ministry, which has gone </p><p>unanswered. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  In this case, Ambassador Sullivan also called the </p><p>Governor of the Midlands province, Cephas Msipa, to discuss </p><p>the forced acquisition.  Governor Msipa is a personal friend </p><p>of the Chamblisses and had previously managed to cushion them </p><p>to some degree from the chaotic land grab.  In one instance </p><p>during the fall of 2002, while the Chamblisses were in the </p><p>United States on personal business, a Harare physician showed </p><p>up at the rural property and advised the caretaker that he </p><p>was there to claim the farm.  The Chamblisses contacted </p><p>Governor Msipa from the US; Msipa assured them that the </p><p>claimant was not legitimate and that they could ignore the </p><p>attempted land-grab and return to their property. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Governor Msipa advised the Ambassador that he had </p><p>spoken with the Chamblisses the day before his conversation </p><p>with the Ambassador.  Msipa claimed that he did not </p><p>understand why the new Section 8 notices had gone out, since </p><p>the GOZ had agreed on December 8 not to notify any </p><p>conservancy owners of impending acquisition until a general </p><p>land policy toward conservancies was agreed upon and </p><p>implemented.  Msipa feared that Minister of Lands, </p><p>Agriculture and Resettlement Joseph Made made the decision to </p><p>seize the Midlands properties on his own.  Msipa stated that </p><p>he had already raised the issue of both the conservancy </p><p>status of the property as well as US citizen ownership with </p><p>Vice President Msika and other relevant ministers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  In a recent meeting with Laboff, Ambassador Lucas </p><p>Tavaya, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment </p><p>and Tourism, argued that that "many" farmers had previously </p><p>chosen to turn productive farmland to the cultivation of </p><p>wildlife, to their personal benefit and the detriment of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s food security.  Laboff was further advised that </p><p>"(private) conservancies were not recognized under Zimbabwe </p><p>law."  When pressed with the question of whether the GOZ </p><p>refused to recognize the existence of private conservancies </p><p>such as Malilangwe, Save Valley Conservancy, and Bubiana </p><p>Conservancy,  Ambassador Tavaya backtracked and stated that </p><p>"most farms calling themselves conservancies did not meet the </p><p>definition of a conservancy."  It may be that this latest </p><p>sweep of Section 8 notices is merely intended to seize white </p><p>commercial farmland that had previously fallen through </p><p>procedural cracks.  However, Ambassador Tavaya\'s ambiguous </p><p>comments about the legal status of conservancies may indicate </p><p>that the GOZ is attempting to sidestep its previously stated </p><p>support of private conservancies in order to justify forced </p><p>acquisition.  Against a concerted GOZ attempt to acquire </p><p>wildlife conservancies, simply calling a farm a "conservancy" </p><p>-- regardless of the legal steps taken to dedicate such farms </p><p>to wildlife conservation -- will no longer offer any </p><p>protection to landowners. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  At this point, it appears that the Section 8 notice </p><p>gives the Chamblisses ninety days to vacate their property -- </p><p>forty-five days to wind up their "farming" operations, and a </p><p>further forty-five days to vacate their homestead.  Although </p><p>they must vacate this property within the stipulated period, </p><p>the Chamblisses would retain, nonetheless, the right to </p><p>pursue their case through the courts.  It is unclear whether </p><p>the intervention of Post or of Governor Msipa will help the </p><p>Chamblisses retain possession of their property. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
