<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ROME PASS TO AMBASSADOR TONY HALL, MAX FINBERG </p><p>AND TIM LAVELLE AT FODAG </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>USAID/W FOR DCHA,OFDA,FFP AND AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MAJOR ISSUES FOR AMBASSADOR TONY HALL\'S VISIT </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE, OCTOBER 8 - OCTOBER 11 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p>NOT SUITABLE FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The US Mission in Zimbabwe welcomes the visit </p><p>of Ambassador Anthony Hall to Zimbabwe.  Ambassador </p><p>Hall\'s schedule includes several meetings with donors </p><p>and NGOs working on the delivery of humanitarian </p><p>assistance, senior Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) </p><p>officials and civil society leaders. </p><p> </p><p>We expect that these meetings will focus on the </p><p>following seven major issues: </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Issue 1:  GOZ Policies and the Food Crisis </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The economic and political policies of the </p><p>GOZ have created the food crisis in Zimbabwe.  This </p><p>mismanagement has been aggravated by the lack of rain </p><p>during the critical growing period last season.  Many </p><p>of the same policies have hindered the domestic and </p><p>international response to the crisis. Most importantly, </p><p>the Grain Marketing Board\'s monopoly on the purchase of </p><p>grain from local producers and on the import of grain, </p><p>along with government price controls on basic </p><p>commodities (including maize) far below market price </p><p>deters production and prevents the private sector from </p><p>ameliorating the crisis.  The impact of the fast track </p><p>land reform program is well known.  The lack of foreign </p><p>exchange, due to the unrealistic fixed exchange rate, </p><p>has limited the GOZ\'s ability to import food and fuel </p><p>to move the food.  This has contributed to a black </p><p>market in basic foods which has pushed them outside of </p><p>the ability of many even with some money to purchase </p><p>staple foods.  The implosion of the economy has also </p><p>significantly limited the GOZ\'s ability to provide </p><p>agricultural inputs (seed, fertilizer, and land </p><p>preparation) to the new farmers, guaranteeing a </p><p>continuation of the food crisis after the next harvest. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post recommends that you raise these policy issues </p><p>in meetings with GOZ officials in order to facilitate </p><p>the operation of the donors trying to respond to the </p><p>food crisis and to permit the participation of the </p><p>private sector.  A change in these policies would </p><p>lessen the severity of the inevitable continuation of </p><p>the crisis next year. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Issue 2:  Food Gap </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The recently released Emergency Food Security </p><p>Assessment report indicates that a more realistic </p><p>estimate of the food gap may be 5-600,000MT prior to </p><p>the next harvest season.  The food gap is defined as </p><p>the total amount of food needed to prevent massive </p><p>hunger minus the sum of food in country, food the GOZ </p><p>and private sector can import and food commitments by </p><p>the donor community.  Without significantly greater </p><p>food commitments to the WFP EMOP or a significant </p><p>policy change by the GOZ to permit the private sector </p><p>to participate, Zimbabwe faces a potentially </p><p>significant human catastrophe.  Although the GOZ claims </p><p>to be covering much of the gap, there are serious </p><p>doubts that it will be able to import the additional </p><p>650,000MT of grain it has promised.  Post does, though, </p><p>recommend that you encourage the GOZ to meet its public </p><p>commitments.  Even if the GOZ does fully meet this </p><p>commitment, a significant gap will still exist (over </p><p>100,000MT). </p><p> </p><p>-- Post recommends that you highlight this gap in </p><p>discussions with WFP and other donors in order to </p><p>encourage increased contributions, and with GOZ </p><p>officials and in press contacts to push for policy </p><p>changes that will permit the private sector to </p><p>participate in the relief effort. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Issue 3:  Biotech Food Imports </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The USG has committed to providing significant </p><p>food contributions to the current crisis.  However, </p><p>current GOZ policies related to biotech food imports </p><p>have impeded our efforts to meet this commitment.  The </p><p>first round of this issue has been resolved with the </p><p>signing of an MOU to swap GM whole kernel corn from the </p><p>US with current non-GM maize held by the GOZ for </p><p>distribution by WFP.  The GOZ will take responsibility </p><p>for milling and distribution of the US grain.  This </p><p>agreement only covers 17,500MT of corn currently held </p><p>in Durban, RSA.  There is no formal agreement from the </p><p>USG, WFP, or the GOZ on future imports of whole kernel </p><p>corn from the US.  We are waiting to see how successful </p><p>this swap will be. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post recommends that you discuss with GOZ officials </p><p>and with WFP officials alternative means for future </p><p>importation of US whole kernel corn, including the </p><p>potential for further swaps or funding options for </p><p>milling. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Issue 4:  NGO Capacity </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) It is clear that Zimbabwe will need all the food </p><p>it can get.  Non-GOZ food distribution is done through </p><p>NGOs.  The NGOs that participate in the WFP program </p><p>must be registered with the Ministry of Social Welfare. </p><p>Currently, the WFP works with 7 international NGOs, </p><p>and has only been able to reach less than half of its </p><p>food distribution goal of 55,000MT per month.  WFP and </p><p>the UN Resident Coordinator have been pressing this </p><p>issue, but it is proving very difficult for additional </p><p>NGOs to get registered; e.g., OXFAM, CRS and Save the </p><p>Children (UK) were all rejected while at least 3 others </p><p>are still waiting to be registered.  More international </p><p>NGOs will be needed to meet the food requirements of </p><p>the people. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post recommends that you bring up this critical </p><p>issue in your meeting with the Minister of Social </p><p>Welfare, July Moyo, whose Ministry is responsible for </p><p>the registration of the NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Post is also concerned about the capacity of </p><p>the NGOs already implementing programs to fulfill their </p><p>numerous obligations.  USG and WFP policies are to use </p><p>international NGOs to lead the implementation of their </p><p>humanitarian assistance (HA) food distribution </p><p>programs, some in partnership with local organizations. </p><p>There are a very limited number of such NGOs registered </p><p>to do this work in Zimbabwe.  Therefore, there is </p><p>significant overlap of implementers between bilateral </p><p>and multilateral food distribution programs.  In fact, </p><p>the main NGOs (World Vision, CRS, and CARE) are used </p><p>by both operations, in addition to their own programs. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, OFDA is entering into a seed distribution </p><p>program with these same NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post recommends that you express concern about the </p><p>capacity of the existing NGOs to carry out so many </p><p>programs simultaneously when you meet with these </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Issue 5:  The PVO Law </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The GOZ has signaled its intention to crack </p><p>down on the operation of Private Voluntary </p><p>organizations (PVOs) (including Trusts), particularly </p><p>those involved in democracy/human rights and in </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  As many as 2/3 of the local </p><p>NGOs could face closure and/or criminal penalties by </p><p>being declared in violation of the current registration </p><p>laws.  A new draft PVO law is also rumored to prohibit </p><p>local PVOs from receiving support from sources outside </p><p>of the country.  This could have far reaching impact on </p><p>the entire US assistance program and cripple the </p><p>current humanitarian assistance efforts of the donor </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p>-- While we are certain that WFP and NGOs will raise </p><p>this issue with you, you should be sure to raise it </p><p>with GOZ officials. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Issue 6:  Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Current estimates indicate that there are </p><p>750,000 - 1 million IDPs in Zimbabwe.  Most of these </p><p>are economically and/or physically displaced farm </p><p>workers.  It is expected that this number could reach 2 </p><p>million IDPs by next year.  Both the USG and the UN are </p><p>assessing the situation, but no one has programmed </p><p>significant funds to deal with the problem. </p><p>-- Post recommends that you raise this issue in </p><p>discussions with the UN and others outside government </p><p>and solicit views on what more can be done to address </p><p>the problem.  We also recommend that you encourage the </p><p>UN Resident Coordinator to get promised OCHA support in </p><p>place as soon as possible. </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Issue 7:  Monitoring Food Delivery </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) You should be aware that there have been </p><p>documented accusations of political bias in the GOZ\'s </p><p>emergency food distribution program. The major food </p><p>donors have been working with the UN to establish a </p><p>food delivery monitoring unit ("Information and </p><p>Verification Unit" - IVU) to investigate such charges </p><p>related to all food distribution programs.  It has been </p><p>agreed to set up this unit in the Relief and Recovery </p><p>Unit (RRU) of the Office of the UN Resident </p><p>Coordinator.  While the RRU has never been a strong </p><p>player in donor coordination we had hoped that </p><p>additional support from OCHA would strengthen their </p><p>performance.  That support has not yet been put in </p><p>place.  Unfortunately, the management of the RRU has </p><p>continued to deteriorate and the donors have concerns </p><p>about the viability not only of the RRU but of the </p><p>much more important IVU. </p><p> </p><p>-- We recommend that you raise the future of the RRU </p><p>and the IVU in your meetings with the Resident </p><p>Coordinator as well as with other major food </p><p>donors - most notably the EU Ambassador (the EU will be </p><p>providing the bulk of funding for the IVU) and the High </p><p>Commissioner of the UK (the other major food donor). </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
