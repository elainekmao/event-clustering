<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, PBTS, NATO, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH MFA ON "PEACE CONSOLIDATION" IN MOLDOVA PAPER </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 161930 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR NATHANIEL DEAN FOR REASONS 1. </p><p>5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>(C) ACTING POLCOUNS DELIVERED REFTEL COMMENTS TO DUTCH MFA </p><p>OSCE TASK FORCE OFFICERS GEOFFREY VAN LEEUWEN AND WILLEMIJN </p><p>KALLENBERG ON JUNE 13.  AS SUGGESTED REFTEL, THE DUTCH PLAN </p><p>TO SHARE THEIR DRAFT PAPER ON A "PEACE CONSOLIDATION" FORCE </p><p>IN MOLDOVA WITH BOTH THE MOLDOVANS AND THE RUSSIANS.  OWING </p><p>TO HOM HILL\'S PRESENCE IN WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK, THEY PLAN TO </p><p>PASS THEIR PAPER VIA THE MOLDOVAN AMBASSADOR IN VIENNA EARLY </p><p>IN THE WEEK.  THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE GOM A CHANCE TO </p><p>DIGEST THEIR IDEAS BEFORE SHARING THE PAPER WITH THE </p><p>RUSSIANS.  THE DUTCH ACCEPTED WASHINGTON\'S SUGGESTION OF </p><p>DELETING REFERENCE TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF TROOPS FOR THE </p><p>FORCE SO AS TO AVOID THE RUSSIANS POCKETING A SPECIFIC </p><p>NUMBER.  CONCERNING REFERENCE TO THE EU\'S "EXISTING PLANNING, </p><p>COMMAND AND CONTROL CAPACITY," THEY ARE STILL WORKING ON THE </p><p>TEXT (ACTING POLCOUNS WAS SHOWN LATEST DRAFT AND MFA\'S </p><p>NATO-CENTRIC SECURITY POLICY DEPARTMENT HAD ALSO SOUGHT TO </p><p>ADJUST THIS LANGUAGE).  THEY CURRENTLY PLAN TO ADD AN ANNEX </p><p>TO THE PAPER SPELLING OUT THE ESDP ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING </p><p>HOW THE RUSSIANS MIGHT BE WOVEN INTO AN EU-LED FORCE.  (MFA </p><p>OSCE TASK FORCE CHIEF AMB. EVERTS STRESSED IN HIS JUNE 12 </p><p>MEETING WITH AMB. PERINA THAT THE DUTCH WOULD INSIST THAT ANY </p><p>EU OPERATION BE CONSISTENT WITH BERLIN PLUS ARRANGEMENTS.) </p><p>VAN LEEUWEN SAID THAT WHILE THE FORCE WOULD HAVE AN OSCE </p><p>MANDATE, THE EU WOULD MAINTAIN POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE </p><p>MILITARY OPERATION, WITH THE RUSSIANS INCLUDED AT THE TROOP </p><p>LEVEL.  AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH THE EU THE DUTCH WOULD PLAN </p><p>TO HAVE HIREP SOLANA DISCUSS THE PLAN WITH VORONIN AND THEN </p><p>FM IVANOV. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
