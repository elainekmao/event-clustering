(U) Although Canada\'s energy exports to the United </p><p>States have grown at impressive rates in recent decades, </p><p>making Canada our largest total energy supplier, Canada\'s </p><p>conventional natural gas resources are maturing and </p><p>production from current areas could peak within a decade. </p><p>GOC forecasters expect that Canada\'s exports of natural </p><p>gas will peak in 10-15 years and their share of U.S. </p><p>demand will decline from about 18 percent at the peak, to </p><p>perhaps 13 percent by 2025.  Yet, like other countries, </p><p>both the U.S. and Canada continue to build gas-burning </p><p>infrastructure at high rates.  There is a risk that </p><p>future tight gas supplies and high prices could "strand" </p><p>some of this investment (i.e. make it uneconomic before </p><p>the end of its intended lifespan). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Gas industry observers are increasingly focused </p><p>on what is required in order for yet-to-be-developed </p><p>northern gas resources - in Alaska and in Canada\'s </p><p>northern territories - to take the place of these </p><p>"maturing" conventional supplies.  Because Canada is a </p><p>net energy exporter, it is much more willing to accept </p><p>high energy prices, and thus its economic interests with </p><p>respect to northern gas development differ significantly </p><p>from those of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) An outcome attractive to key Canadian interests </p><p>would likely entail (1) ensuring that two pipelines </p><p>(Mackenzie Valley and Alaska Highway) are constructed, </p><p>and (2) locating industrial benefits - perhaps a gas- </p><p>liquids separation facility - in Canada.  Observers argue </p><p>that, while such a "big political deal" could be </p><p>relatively straightforward and low-risk, only the USG has </p><p>an overwhelming interest in brokering it. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) This message is based on conversations with </p><p>contacts in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton and was prepared </p><p>with assistance from Amconsul Calgary. </p><p>END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GAS DEMAND GROWTH CONCENTRATED IN POWER SECTOR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Recent rapid growth in overall demand for natural </p><p>gas has been driven by this fuel\'s low cost and </p><p>availability, and its low emissions relative to oil and </p><p>coal.  In electric power generation, another important </p><p>factor is at work:  gas-burning plants can be located </p><p>very close to power markets, avoiding the need to </p><p>construct additional power transmission lines, which has </p><p>become very difficult politically (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) As a result, ExxonMobil forecasts that while total </p><p>world energy demand will grow at an average 1.8 percent </p><p>annual rate through 2020, gas demand will grow faster - </p><p>2.6 percent overall, and 3.6 percent in the power </p><p>industry.  By ExxonMobil\'s projection, gas will fuel 29 </p><p>percent of the world\'s electricity by 2020 (versus 21 </p><p>percent today). </p><p> </p><p>CONVENTIONAL GAS SUPPLIES MATURING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Most of Canada\'s natural gas production so far has </p><p>come from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) </p><p>(ref B), where conventional production is expected to </p><p>peak in 2008-2013.  Symptoms of this maturation include </p><p>simultaneous high drilling rates and declining new </p><p>discoveries; steeply rising drilling/discovery costs; and </p><p>a withdrawal from gas drilling activity by major energy </p><p>firms. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Coal-bed methane and other nonconventional gas </p><p>sources, while they are promising, might not be large </p><p>enough to fully offset the decline in conventional </p><p>production.  It appears unlikely that they will be </p><p>sufficient to cause overall Canadian gas production to </p><p>grow beyond the period 2015-2020 (see figure 5.6 of the </p><p>National Energy Board study, "Canadian Energy Supply and </p><p>Demand to 2025," at neb-one.gc.ca).  As a result, the NEB </p><p>expects Canada\'s natural gas exports to peak in the </p><p>period 2013-2018.  Canadian exports\' share of total U.S. </p><p>gas demand is projected to fall from 18 percent at the </p><p>peak, to 13 percent by 2025. </p><p> </p><p>THE NORTH IS WILD </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The "wild card" in this supply-demand projection </p><p>is the development of gas resources from Alaska and </p><p>northwestern Canada.  Canada\'s northern territories </p><p>(roughly north of 60 degrees latitude) contain </p><p>significant oil and gas resources, notably gas in the </p><p>Beaufort Sea and near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, a </p><p>few hundred miles east of Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay.  National </p><p>Energy Board (NEB) projections guesstimate that this gas </p><p>will start coming to market in the period 2009-2017, and </p><p>contribute modestly to supply - perhaps 1.5 to 2 billion </p><p>cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2025, on the order of one- </p><p>tenth of Canada\'s total production.  This GOC forecast </p><p>limits itself to Canada, and is silent on Alaskan </p><p>developments.  Also, over longer time periods, </p><p>development could extend to far larger reserves further </p><p>north, in Canada\'s Arctic Islands. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) IN RECENT DECADES, THE OBSTACLES TO OIL AND GAS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN THE TERRITORIES HAVE SHRUNK DUE TO A </p><p>NUMBER OF TRENDS - INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, </p><p>INCREASED DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS AS OPPOSED TO OIL (GAS </p><p>BEING EASIER TO TRANSPORT IN COLD CONDITIONS), PROGRESS </p><p>ON ABORIGINAL LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS, AND GREATER </p><p>RECEPTIVENESS TO RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AMONG ABORIGINAL </p><p>GROUPS (SEE REF D FOR DETAILS).  THE GOC HAS HELD </p><p>REGULAR AUCTIONS OF EXPLORATION RIGHTS IN THE NORTHERN </p><p>TERRITORIES SINCE THE LATE 1990\'S (SEE WEBSITE </p><p>INAC.GC.CA/OIL FOR DETAILS).  NEVERTHELESS, GREAT </p><p>UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE POLITICAL- </p><p>REGULATORY TIME LAG FROM PROPOSAL TO THE START OF </p><p>CONSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>PIPELINE PLANS TO ACCELERATE THIS YEAR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) With rising energy prices in 2000-2001 and the </p><p>release of the USG\'s National Energy Policy Report in May </p><p>2001, interest in northern pipeline developments revived. </p><p>Various stakeholder groups formed alliances to promote </p><p>one prospective route or another.  The two most </p><p>frequently suggested options are: </p><p> </p><p>-- A relatively short, flat "all-Canadian" line from the </p><p>Mackenzie Delta southward up the river valley and into </p><p>northern Alberta.  (In an ambitious, one-pipeline </p><p>solution known as the "over the top" route, the north end </p><p>of this line could conceivably extend westward to Prudhoe </p><p>Bay - but this would greatly expand both the project\'s </p><p>scale, and the political/environmental/aboriginal </p><p>barriers to approval). </p><p> </p><p>-- A more mountainous "Alaska Highway" line from Alaska\'s </p><p>North Slope southward to Fairbanks, thence more or less </p><p>along the highway route through the Yukon Territory and </p><p>northern British Columbia to northern Alberta. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The stakeholder alliance in support of the "all- </p><p>Canadian" Mackenzie Valley line involves the Government </p><p>of the Northwest Territories (NWT), the Aboriginal </p><p>Pipeline Group (APG), and likely either or both of the </p><p>largest pipeline operators -- TransCanada Pipelines </p><p>(transcanada.com) and/or Enbridge (enbridge.com). </p><p>Insiders expect the NEB to receive a formal application </p><p>regarding this line during 2003.  Supporters have lobbied </p><p>the GOC for fiscal incentives, but so far without </p><p>success, as the GOC (like the USG) remains officially </p><p>"route-neutral." </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Backers of the "Alaska Highway" line include the </p><p>Governments of Alaska and the Yukon Territory, as well as </p><p>Foothills Pipelines (foothillspipe.com).  Foothills holds </p><p>permits dating from the 1970\'s (and now of undefined </p><p>value) to build a gas line on this route.  Supporters and </p><p>opponents are intensely interested in the final version </p><p>of forthcoming U.S. energy legislation, since it may </p><p>include various fiscal measures ("subsidies," pricing </p><p>mechanisms, tax credits) which would affect the project\'s </p><p>economics. </p><p> </p><p>A MACKENZIE LINE ALONE WON\'T BE ENOUGH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) While the "Canada-only" pipeline proposal may seem </p><p>at this point to be moving toward realization, even if it </p><p>were built first, it is not projected to offset either the </p><p>decline in gas production from the WCSB, or the need to </p><p>bring Alaska\'s North Slope gas to market.  A "Canada-only" </p><p>line would only deliver perhaps one-third as much gas as a </p><p>line from Alaska.  Moreover, Mackenzie gas is expected to be </p><p>mostly or entirely consumed in Northern Alberta, since gas </p><p>will be the main energy input to the production of crude oil </p><p>from Alberta\'s oil sands.  (This energy-intensive, heat- </p><p>driven process will see immense capital investment over the </p><p>coming decade as conventional oil production declines in </p><p>Western Canada). </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) If, as now seems quite possible, the "Canada-only" </p><p>line begins construction first, this is considered unlikely </p><p>to make much difference to the economic case for building a </p><p>larger line from Alaska\'s North Slope soon afterward.  On </p><p>the other hand, if an Alaska line were to begin construction </p><p>first, this could well put off the construction of a </p><p>Mackenzie Valley line for at least several years.  For one </p><p>thing, the demand generated by the larger Alaska project </p><p>would drive up prices for already scarce skilled labor, </p><p>pipe, and other inputs; for another, the resulting gas </p><p>supply would undercut the economic case for the smaller </p><p>line. </p><p> </p><p>ALASKA GAS:  U.S. HOLDS THE BIGGEST INTEREST BY FAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) Obviously, Alaska natural gas development must </p><p>answer many questions and clear many hurdles in order to </p><p>become reality.  How much would it really cost to build? </p><p>What are the environmental consequences?  How can aboriginal </p><p>groups best participate?  Might liquefied natural gas (LNG) </p><p>facilities make more sense as a transportation option? </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) But those discussing these questions should be </p><p>cognizant of Canadian factors which are too easily </p><p>underestimated in a "lower 48" perspective: </p><p> </p><p>-- If a pipeline (rather than LNG) is to be the means of </p><p>transport, Alaskan gas must cross Canadian territory in </p><p>order to reach major markets.  That territory is at least </p><p>1,500 miles wide and is under four or more jurisdictions. </p><p> </p><p>-- The usual close alignment of national economic interests </p><p>will not necessarily hold in this case.  Indeed, Canadian </p><p>economic and regional interests could work against this </p><p>development - at least, without some major political deal- </p><p>making.  And Canada, as an energy exporter, can tolerate the </p><p>higher natural gas prices that might result if Alaskan gas </p><p>remains undeveloped.  Simply put, an Alaska gas pipeline is </p><p>much more clearly in the U.S. national interest than it is </p><p>in Canada\'s national interest.  This is particularly true as </p><p>a Canada-only Mackenzie Valley pipeline moves toward the </p><p>proposal stage. </p><p>MAKING THE CASE TO CANADIANS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska </p><p>would have positive economic spin-offs in western Canada, </p><p>but Canadians in that region understand well that such </p><p>effects are small and brief, because construction tends to </p><p>employ "flown-in" skilled trades and lasts only a few </p><p>seasons.  The key sustained payoff for Canadian interests </p><p>would be in hosting "gas stripping" facilities to separate </p><p>liquids from the relatively "wet" Alaska gas.  These liquids </p><p>provide inputs for petrochemicals and plastics industries </p><p>that are already established in Alberta, and which the </p><p>provincial government is determined to expand in the long- </p><p>term. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) On the downside, there are two major "negative </p><p>risks" for Canadian interests.  First, subsidies or other </p><p>incentives granted to Alaskan gas could take market- </p><p>distorting forms that would be inconsistent with both </p><p>countries\' expressed energy policies.  Second, both </p><p>construction and the resulting gas flows could undercut the </p><p>economics of a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.  Regional and some </p><p>national leaders very much want the latter pipeline for its </p><p>wider regional development effects - including all-season </p><p>roads and stimulus to hydrocarbon and mineral exploration </p><p>(see ref D). </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) It bears noting that these concerns could be easy </p><p>for U.S. interests to address.  Alberta (or northeastern </p><p>British Columbia) may well be the most economic location in </p><p>North America for gas-liquids separation, given northern </p><p>Alberta\'s already massive gas processing capacity.  Market- </p><p>distorting subsidies are, after all, not in either country\'s </p><p>true interest.  And as noted above (para. 15), the Mackenzie </p><p>Valley line, which may have a head start anyhow, is not </p><p>expected to change the fundamental economic case for Alaskan </p><p>gas development. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  THE BOTTOM LINE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) COMMENT:  North America will need to have its </p><p>"north of sixty" natural gas developed during the next two </p><p>decades.  We can discern features of a possible low-cost, </p><p>low-risk political bargain that could pave the road to </p><p>developing this gas - by assuring key jurisdictions that </p><p>they will benefit, without imposing gross distortions on </p><p>energy markets. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU)  The USG and GOC are already committed to "route- </p><p>neutrality" and in most parties\' opinions - as well as from </p><p>an economic standpoint - they should remain so.  If fiscal </p><p>regimes must be tilted in favor of developments preferred by </p><p>the State of Alaska, it is clearly in the broader U.S. </p><p>national interest (economically and diplomatically) to </p><p>minimize the bias. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (SBU)  Most stakeholders will be satisfied if two </p><p>pipelines - both the Mackenzie Valley (probably first) and </p><p>the Alaska line -- eventually get constructed.  This would </p><p>satisfy top concerns of the sub-federal governments and </p><p>other groups in both the Yukon and Northwest Territories. </p><p>This outcome is also positive for northern Alberta oil-sand </p><p>interests and for the Government of Canada - as well as for </p><p>North America\'s continental energy security.  Finally, a </p><p>"politically ideal" compromise would deliver some industrial </p><p>benefits to British Columbia as well as to Alaska and </p><p>Alberta. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
