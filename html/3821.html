(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02345  01 OF 04  270928Z </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE EXPANSION OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS </p><p>AND DIMINISHMENT OF CPV AND STATE CONTROL OVER </p><p>INDIVIDUAL LIVES HAVE BEEN WELCOME TRENDS OVER THE PAST </p><p>TWO DECADES.  NEW INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP RULE OF LAW </p><p>ARE ALSO HOPEFUL SIGNS OF CHANGE AS WELL AS ESSENTIAL </p><p>COMPONENTS OF VIETNAM\'S CONTINUED INTEGRATION INTO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MARKET ECONOMY.  STRENGTHENED, MORE </p><p>GENUINE LEGAL SYSTEMS WILL EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE </p><p>CPV\'S EFFECTIVE ABILITY TO RETAIN FINAL SAY ON ALL </p><p>MAJOR POLICY AND LEGAL ISSUES, HOWEVER.  THE CURRENT </p><p>GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP IS PROBABLY TOO BUSY </p><p>SUSTAINING THE NEEDED MOMENTUM OF ECONOMIC GROWTH TO </p><p>COPE WITH THIS DILEMMA.  MORE RESULTS-ORIENTED AND/OR </p><p>WESTERN-EDUCATED OFFICIALS FIVE OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW </p><p>MAY BE ABLE TO ACCEPT -- OR POSSIBLY EVEN INSIST ON -- </p><p>A MORE PASSIVE CPV ROLE.  LESS PROGRESSIVE LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS CONSERVATIVE AND FRUSTRATED </p><p>ELEMENTS WITHIN THE MILITARY, MAY CONTINUE TO BE DRAGS </p><p>ON ANY EVENTUAL POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION, HOWEVER. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOOD NEWS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY </p><p>IN VIETNAM HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT -- AND MOSTLY </p><p>WELCOME -- CHANGE OVER THE SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) AND GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM (GVN) INSTITUTED THE "DOI MOI" POLICY OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02345  01 OF 04  270928Z </p><p>RENOVATION (MORE LITERALLY, "NEW CHANGE").  THE OVERALL </p><p>THRUST HAS BEEN TO REDUCE THE MICRO-MANAGEMENT BY THE </p><p>STATE NOT ONLY IN ECONOMIC PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE BUT </p><p>ALSO IN THE PERSONAL LIVES OF ITS CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  VIETNAMESE NOW HAVE DRAMATICALLY MORE PERSONAL </p><p>FREEDOMS THAN THEY DID TWO DECADES AGO.  THEY CAN </p><p>TRAVEL ESSENTIALLY WITHOUT RESTRICTION DOMESTICALLY, </p><p>AND GO OVERSEAS WITH CONSIDERABLE EASE -- AS LONG AS </p><p>THEY CAN GET A FOREIGN VISA AND HAVE ACCESS TO </p><p>SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES (THEIR OWN OR THEIR VIET </p><p>KIEU RELATIVES).  FARMERS LARGELY DECIDE ON THEIR OWN </p><p>WHAT CROPS TO GROW AS WELL AS HOW, WHERE, AND FOR HOW </p><p>MUCH TO SELL THEM.  NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE JOB MARKET </p><p>MOSTLY FIND THEIR OWN JOBS, INCREASINGLY IN NON-STATE </p><p>SECTOR EMPLOYMENT.  (ACCORDING TO WORLD BANK ESTIMATES, </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL HAVE TO CREATE MORE OR LESS ALL </p><p>OF THE APPROXIMATELY 2 MILLION NEW JOBS NEEDED ANNUALLY </p><p>OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.)   MOST -- IF NOT VIRTUALLY </p><p>ALL -- RURAL CITIZENS LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES, WHICH </p><p>THEY BUILD AND/OR EXPAND AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.  A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF URBAN RESIDENTS INCREASINGLY </p><p>DO THE SAME.  MORE CHURCHES AND TEMPLES ARE AVAILABLE </p><p>FOR ROUTINE USE BY THE FAITHFUL -- ALBEIT UNDER THE </p><p>SUPERVISION OF GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>ORGANS -- AND THE NUMBERS OF RELIGIOUS WORKERS ARE </p><p>STEADILY INCREASINGLY AGAIN AS RELIGIOUS SEMINARIES </p><p>HAVE BEEN RE-OPENED AND EXPANDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE INTRUSIONS INTO INDIVIDUAL LIVES BY PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY FORCES HAVE DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH THE GVN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02345  01 OF 04  270928Z </p><p>RETAINS THE CAPABILITY OF MONITORING MAIL, TELEPHONES, </p><p>AND E-MAIL, AS WELL AS WATCHING VISITORS FOR THOSE </p><p>CITIZENS WHOSE LOYALTY IS IN DOUBT OR ARE BELIEVED TO </p><p>BE ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p>VISIBLE SURVEILLANCE OF FOREIGNERS HAS DECLINED.  THE </p><p>PENALTIES OR HARASSMENT OF VIETNAMESE CITIZENS WHO </p><p>BEFRIEND FOREIGNERS, INCLUDING DIPLOMATS, SEEM TO BE </p><p>MORE RARELY INVOKED.  DISCUSSIONS, EVEN ON POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUES, AT HANOI\'S UBIQUITOUS BEER HALLS ARE MORE AND </p><p>MORE FREE-WHEELING, ALTHOUGH ALMOST INEVITABLY STOPPING </p><p>SHORT OF ANY DIRECT CRITICISM OF THE CPV OR CALLING FOR </p><p>MULTI-PARTY DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>THE BAD NEWS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CPV LEADERS CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE ZERO </p><p>TOLERANCE OF POLITICAL PLURALISM OR ANY INTENTION TO </p><p>LOOSEN THEIR GRIP ON THE MONOPOLY OF POLITICAL POWER. </p><p>THE CPV\'S POLITBURO, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE, REMAIN THE NEXUS OF ALL IMPORTANT DECISION- </p><p>MAKING.  IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 11ST NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>INAUGURAL SESSION IN JULY AND AUGUST 2002, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS ARE BELIEVED </p><p>TO HAVE HAMMERED OUT THE NEW GOVERNMENT LINE-UP THAT </p><p>WAS THEN DULY RATIFIED BY THE NA DELEGATES.

THE NEW SLATE </p><p>OF NA DELEGATES ACTUALLY INCREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>CPV MEMBERS IN THE NA, REVERSING WHAT HAD APPEARED TO </p><p>BE A DIFFERENT TREND IN THE ELECTIONS FIVE YEARS AGO </p><p>AND FOILING THE NA\'S OWN ANNOUNCED INTENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  CPV PLENUM DOCUMENTS OVER THE PAST MANY MONTHS </p><p>HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO IMPROVE "GRASSROOTS </p><p>DEMOCRACY," BUT THIS HAS NOT LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF </p><p>EMPOWERMENT OR PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING AT THE </p><p>LOCAL LEVEL.  INSTEAD, THE PUSH APPEARS TO BE ON </p><p>REINVIGORATING AND STRENGTHENING CPV LEADERSHIP DOWN TO </p><p>THE LOWEST LEVELS IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE THE CPV\'S </p><p>WILL DOWNWARD -- NOT TO ENSURE THAT OPINIONS AND </p><p>POPULAR WISHES ARE CHANNELED UPWARD.  THE CPV IS ALSO </p><p>POISED -- OR AT LEAST IT SAYS IT IS -- TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>MORE SYSTEMATIC ROTATION OF CPV AND GVN OFFICIALS AMONG </p><p>PROVINCES AS WELL AS BETWEEN PROVINCES AND THE CENTER </p><p>IN ORDER TO UPROOT ENDEMIC CORRUPTION AND TO LESSEN </p><p>LOCAL FIEFDOMS THAT SOMETIMES THREATEN EFFECTIVE </p><p>CENTRAL CPV LEADERSHIP.  IT IS ALSO ENGAGING IN A NEW </p><p>PUSH TO RE-EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN THE </p><p>NATION\'S ALREADY NONE-TOO-STRONG EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, </p><p>WHERE STUDENTS ARE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND </p><p>IN ENGLISH AND COMPUTER SKILLS -- AMONG OTHER ESSENTIAL </p><p>TOPICS -- COMPARED WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE LEGAL SYSTEM REMAINS AT BEST IN ITS </p><p>INFANCY, ALTHOUGH PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE USG, UNDP, AND </p><p>OTHER DONORS HAVE BEGUN TO PAY OFF IN TERMS OF CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, THE JUDICIARY, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02345  02 OF 04  270928Z </p><p>AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  DESPITE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>GUARANTEES THAT ALL DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE PRESUMED </p><p>INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, HOWEVER, AS MANY AS 95 </p><p>PCT OF ALL CASES RESULT IN CONVICTION.  THIS IS </p><p>UNLIKELY EITHER TO BE A COINCIDENCE OR A TRIBUTE TO </p><p>EFFECTIVE PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES.  JUDGES IN VIETNAM </p><p>WERE NOT EVEN REQUIRED TO HAVE A BACHELOR\'S DEGREE </p><p>UNTIL 1999.  NO LEGAL TRAINING WAS OFFERED IN THIS </p><p>COUNTRY BETWEEN 1954 AND 1976. THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE </p><p>DID NOT EVEN EXIST BETWEEN 1960 AND 1984.  CPV CELLS </p><p>CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, AS AT ALL </p><p>OTHER MINISTRIES, AS WELL AS WITHIN THE JUDICIARY; THE </p><p>COMMON PERCEPTION IS THAT THESE CELLS HAVE THE FINAL </p><p>SAY ON ANY REMOTELY SENSITIVE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>RULE BY PARTY VS. RULE BY LAW </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ARGUABLY, IT IS THE CPV-BLESSED TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AIMED AT CREATING OR IMPROVING RULE </p><p>OF LAW -- OR AT LEAST WHAT MANY DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS </p><p>DISMISSIVELY LABEL "RULE BY LAW" -- THAT MAY LEAD TO </p><p>POLITICAL COLLISIONS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.  THE CPV </p><p>WILL FACE TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT ITS OWN FUTURE ROLE.  THE </p><p>CONCEPTS OF TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, PRIMACY OF </p><p>LEGAL PRECEDENCE, EQUAL APPLICATION OF LAW AND </p><p>REGULATION, AND NATIONAL TREATMENT FLY IN THE FACE OF </p><p>TIME-HONORED CPV TRADITIONS OF SECRECY, PATERNALISTIC </p><p>GOVERNANCE, AND FAVORITISM FOR STATE ENTITIES.  MANY </p><p>VIETNAMESE OPENLY ASSUME THAT SENIOR CPV LEADERS ARE </p><p>VIRTUALLY IMMUNE FROM LEGAL PROSECUTION, APART FROM THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02345  02 OF 04  270928Z </p><p>OCCASIONAL SCAPEGOATS (MOST RECENTLY IN THE NAM CAM </p><p>CORRUPTION CASE THAT LED TO THE OUSTER -- BUT NOT </p><p>PROSECUTION SO FAR -- OF ONE VICE MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE VOICE OF </p><p>VIETNAM RADIO).   FOR RULE OF LAW TO WORK, THE CPV </p><p>CANNOT RETAIN THE FINAL SAY, EVEN ON A PICK-AND-CHOOSE </p><p>BASIS.  TRUE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE WOULD UNDERMINE THE </p><p>CPV\'S CONSTITUTIONALLY-MANDATED ROLE AS THE LEADING </p><p>FORCE OF THE STATE AND SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  FOR VIETNAM TO BECOME AND REMAIN TRULY </p><p>COMPETITIVE IN THE REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKET- </p><p>BASED ECONOMY AND TO ATTRACT NEEDED FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p>CAPITAL, HOWEVER, THE GVN HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO PROCEED </p><p>WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LEGAL SYSTEM AND BUILDING </p><p>OF RULE OF LAW.  IT CANNOT HOPE TO IMPLEMENT THE US- </p><p>VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITHOUT DOING SO, NOR </p><p>CAN IT DREAM OF WTO ACCESSION OTHERWISE.  IT CANNOT </p><p>SUSTAIN THE JOB CREATION MOMENTUM NEEDED TO EMPLOY ITS </p><p>YOUNG AND GROWING POPULATION WITHOUT THE LEGAL </p><p>GUARANTEES AND SAFEGUARDS THAT ENABLE PRIVATE </p><p>ENTERPRISE TO FLOURISH.  IT IS TRUE THAT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ECONOMY AND SOCIETY HAVE NOT FARED AT ALL BADLY OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A GENUINE LEGAL </p><p>SYSTEM.  BUT THE "EASY" REFORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. </p><p>THE COMPETITION FOR MARKETS AND INVESTMENT </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE MUCH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4593 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02345  03 OF 04  270929Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      ED-01    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /021W </p><p>                  ------------------EDC116  270929Z /38 </p><p>R 270931Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7649 </p><p>INFO ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HANOI 002345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>TOUGHER THAN ANYTHING VIETNAM HAS YET EXPERIENCED, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02345  03 OF 04  270929Z </p><p>MUST BE RULES-BASED. </p><p> </p><p>11.

HOWEVER, CPV PLENUMS BEFORE THE </p><p>DECEMBER 2001 NA CONSIDERATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CHANGES AND BEFORE THE JULY 2002 NA VOTES ON THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT LINE-UP PROVIDED QUITE EXPLICIT </p><p>"RECOMMENDATIONS" ON WHAT THE NA SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT </p><p>DO, AND REINFORCED THAT NA DECISION-MAKING SHOULD BE </p><p>NEATLY UNDER THE CPV LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE.

TINKERING </p><p>WITH THE CPV\'S LEADING ROLE, BLESSING NEW POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES, OR EVEN ENFORCING ALL OF THE RIGHTS AND </p><p>FREEDOMS ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN THE CONSTITUTION ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO BE ON THE RADAR SCOPE OF THE POLIBURO. </p><p>CREATING ENOUGH JOBS AND ENSURING THAT URBAN AND RURAL </p><p>INCOMES CONTINUE TO RISE WILL KEEP THE CPV LEADERSHIP </p><p>PREOCCUPIED FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>14.

BARRING MAJOR DOMESTIC </p><p>UNREST OR FOREIGN INVASIONS, THE NEXT GENERATION MAY BE </p><p>READY TO ACQUIESCE IN MORE OF A BACKSEAT ROLE FOR THE </p><p>CPV.  MORE THAN THIS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS </p><p>MAY INSIST ON SUCH A CHANGE.  EVEN SO, SUCH CHANGES ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO BE TOP-DOWN RATHER THAN IN REACTION TO A </p><p>CLAMOR FROM THE "MASSES," WHO ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN </p><p>WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT VOICE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNANCE FOR </p><p>THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
