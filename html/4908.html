<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002502 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IN, NP, PGOV, PTER, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MILITARY AID RUNS AGROUND ON THE SHOALS OF </p><p>BUREAUCRACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael Malinowski for reasons b,d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Delivery of M16A2 rifles for the Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army (RNA), already two months later than scheduled, </p><p>was delayed again on December 24 when the Government of India </p><p>(GOI) denied overflight permission for the transport plane. </p><p>The delay makes the US arms shipment the third in a string of </p><p>military assistance packages that have fallen victim to </p><p>bureaucratic obstacles on their way to Nepal.  Continued </p><p>delay in provision of promised military aid is prompting the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) to look to India and other sources </p><p>for an interim solution to its critical equipment needs.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>BELGIAN AND US SHIPMENTS DELAYED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On December 26, New Delhi DAO was contacted by a </p><p>representative from Air Transport International (ATI), a </p><p>freight company charged with delivery of 3,000 M16A2 rifles </p><p>to Kathmandu, requesting urgent assistance in obtaining </p><p>overflight approval for the transport plane.  According to </p><p>the ATI rep, their commercial agent failed to identify the </p><p>plane\'s cargo as weaponry in the initial permit application, </p><p>resulting in refusal of the request.  After direct </p><p>intervention with the GOI by Embassy New Delhi, the shipment </p><p>of arms, intended to replace the RNA\'s outdated Indian </p><p>Self-Loading Rifles, has been rescheduled for January 6, </p><p>assuming that overflight clearance will be granted. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) In addition, Post was informed on December 31 that </p><p>ammunition intended for the "Balance Nail" training team has </p><p>also been delayed by red tape.  The ammunition was scheduled </p><p>to arrive on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok on December </p><p>31.  However, the shipment didn\'t arrive in Thailand in time </p><p>to make the flight to Kathmandu, and the agreement between </p><p>Thai Airways and the GOI concerning hazmat overflight </p><p>clearance expires at midnight.  The ammunition will have to </p><p>be rerouted on the less-reliable Royal Nepal Airlines, and </p><p>should arrive on January 3, barring any further complications. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The US shipments are only the latest in a string of </p><p>military aid packages that have been held up by bureaucratic </p><p>obstruction on their way to Nepal.  Earlier in December, a </p><p>plane carrying 500 Belgian Minimi machine guns was diverted </p><p>to Kazakhstan when the Eastern European shipping company </p><p>failed to meet Indian overflight requirements.  Delivery of </p><p>the machine guns has been postponed since December 14, while </p><p>Nepali and Belgian diplomats in New Delhi sort out the proper </p><p>application procedure for overflight clearances for arms. </p><p> </p><p>UK HELICOPTERS STUCK IN BELARUS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Two critically needed MI-17 helicopters promised by </p><p>the UK also have been delayed.  Our British colleagues, </p><p>citing their Belgian purchasing agent, expected the </p><p>helicopters to be delivered early in December. Recently they </p><p>learned that the Belarussian airframes have not yet been </p><p>outfitted with engines and may not be outfitted with them any </p><p>time in the near future.  British diplomatic sources did not </p><p>elaborate on  the complications preventing the installation </p><p>of engines, but implied that Russian organized crime and </p><p>possibly government corruption were the root causes of the </p><p>delay.  The resulting cost increases, they say, are </p><p>threatening to quash the entire deal.  The RNA currently has </p><p>only one mission-capable MI-17, its only significant </p><p>troop-carrying helicopter. </p><p> </p><p>RNA: "US HAS NOT DELIVERED" </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) The RNA is becoming increasingly frustrated with </p><p>the inability of the US and other overseas supporters to </p><p>provide arms as quickly as needed to counter increasing </p><p>Maoist violence.  The USG initially planned to deliver 5,000 </p><p>M16A2 rifles in October 2002, and the RNA has already trained </p><p>the units scheduled to receive the weapons.  Although the RNA </p><p>spokesman has publicly stated that once GOI overflight </p><p>applications are processed the army does not expect any </p><p>further problems, confidential comments have been less </p><p>sanguine. "The US has promised a lot but has not delivered," </p><p>one highly placed RNA officer told the Embassy SAO.  "Other </p><p>countries such as Israel, the UK, China and India have </p><p>stepped up and performed, but the RNA is still waiting for </p><p>the US to produce." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) RNA officials have asserted that they would like to </p><p>equip their entire force with M16A2 rifles.  In order to meet </p><p>their existing critical need for weaponry, however, the RNA </p><p>has purchased several thousand inferior Indian Small Arms </p><p>Systems (INSAS) rifles and plans to distribute them to three </p><p>full brigades while waiting for US M16s.  Embassy DATT plans </p><p>to meet with the Indian DATT on January 3 to acquire further </p><p>details. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Post does not believe that the current refusal of </p><p>overflight privileges by the GOI is part of a conscious </p><p>effort to scuttle foreign military assistance to Nepal.  The </p><p>delay appears instead simply to be evidence that Indian </p><p>requirements regarding the overflight of arms are too </p><p>complicated for some transport companies to navigate </p><p>successfully on the first try.  However, while indications </p><p>are that the present delay will be temporary and that the red </p><p>tape surrounding the US and Belgian arms is slowly </p><p>unraveling, Post is desirous to ensure that future shipments </p><p>do not meet a similar fate.  The convergence of bureaucratic </p><p>obstacles and other postponements that have  delayed the </p><p>delivery of military aid undermines the credibility of the </p><p>USG and other military suppliers, and threatens the effective </p><p>coordination of international military assistance.  And </p><p>whatever the cause, failure to provide critically needed arms </p><p>and equipment in a timely fashion to Nepal\'s beleaguered army </p><p>compromises the ability of the GON to combat the Maoist </p><p>insurgency and force the rebels to the bargaining table. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
