<p>UNCLAS ROME 002408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR HALL FOR AMBASSADORS BREMER, RAPHEL AND </p><p>KENNEDY </p><p></p><p>NEA PASS TO ORHA FOR AMBASSADORS BREMER, RAPHEL AND </p><p>KENNEDY </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON, U/S GROSSMAN, IO A/S HOLMES, PRM </p><p>A/S DEWEY, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, SA/INS, IO/EDA S. WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND </p><p>LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR AA/DCHA WINTER, D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, </p><p>D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR JE/J4/J5 </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAID, EAGR, IZ, WFP </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  WFP PURCHASE OF IRAQI WHEAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  IMMEDIATELY UPON MY RETURN TO POST, I SPOKE WITH </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JIM MORRIS ON </p><p>THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2003 CONCERNING WFP\'S PURCHASE OF IRAQI </p><p>WHEAT.  I EMPHASIZED THAT VERY RAPID ACTION IS CRITICAL. </p><p>THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD IS ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ </p><p>RIGHT NOW AND SPEED, COORDINATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ARE </p><p>REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  JIM MORRIS TOLD ME THAT WFP HAS JUST FINALIZED A USD </p><p>152 MILLION COMMITMENT TO BUY THE WHEAT.  THEY BELIEVE -- </p><p>AND I SHARE THEIR VIEW -- THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS </p><p>PROJECT STARTED ABOUT A WEEK AGO, THAT IS VERY QUICK </p><p>    TURNAROUND.  THE PURCHASE PRICE OF USD 105/METRIC TON WAS </p><p>JUST FINALIZED ON MAY 22.  THEY ARE GRATEFUL THAT THEY </p><p>WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN SO LITTLE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY.  WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>NEED FOR WFP TO DEMONSTRATE ONCE AGAIN THAT THEY ARE UP </p><p>TO THE JOB.

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE </p><p>OPEN BETWEEN THE FIELD AND ROME; THAT WE ARE ABLE TO </p><p>SATISFY WFP\'S REQUESTS OF US FOR ASSISTANCE; THAT IN- </p><p>COUNTRY CAPABILITY  -- IN PARTICULAR, OUR MISSION\'S </p><p>SENIOR HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR, REGINA DAVIS, CURRENTLY </p><p>ON THE USAID DART TEAM IN IRAQ -- IS FULLY UTILIZED; AND </p><p>THAT THE DAY-TO-DAY PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH AN OPERATION </p><p>OF THIS SIZE DO NOT BECOME MAJOR ISSUES.    HALL </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02408 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
