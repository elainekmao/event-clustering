<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI, PINR, ECON, EAGR, EMIN, LY </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS KADUNA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 0501 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  Ambassador Jeter paid his first official </p><p>visit to Kaduna State on March 27 and 28.  He met with </p><p>Kaduna Governor Ahmed Makarfi, the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji </p><p>Shehu Idris, former Military Head of State General </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari, Northern kingmaker Dr. Liman Ciroma and </p><p>leaders in Muslim-Christian inter-faith dialogue efforts. </p><p>Governor Makarfi focused on his plans for economic </p><p>expansion in agriculture and solid-minerals development. </p><p>He described his close scrutiny over all government </p><p>contracts, which he claimed to annul or modify where there </p><p>appears to be collusion or kickbacks.  Makarfi said that </p><p>this scrutiny allowed him to provide an unprecedented level </p><p>of infrastructure development and new government services </p><p>while maintaining a balanced budget--one of the benefits of </p><p>an effective anti-corruption campaign.  The Ambassador\'s </p><p>meeting with the Emir of Zazzau was largely protocolary. </p><p>His meetings with Kaduna\'s retired generals will be </p><p>addressed in septel. </p><p>------- </p><p>Shari\'a </p><p>------- </p><p>2. (U)  During his first official visit to Kaduna State, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter was guest of honor at a State Dinner </p><p>hosted by Governor Makarfi on March 27.  During lengthy </p><p>private meetings on March 27 and 28, the Ambassador </p><p>congratulated Governor Makarfi on the work he had done </p><p>since the unrest last February to return Kaduna to </p><p>normalcy.  Makarfi provided an overview of developments in </p><p>Kaduna, and discussed his efforts to rebuild parts of the </p><p>city destroyed in last year\'s rioting, as well as to </p><p>rebuild trust between the various ethnic groups in the </p><p>State (Reftel).  He described the tripartite legal system-- </p><p>criminal Shari\'a and customary courts limited to minor </p><p>offenses, and common law criminal courts for more serious </p><p>offenses.  He said that the choice between Shari\'a, </p><p>customary or common law courts will be at the defendants\' </p><p>discretion, adding that the civil jurisdiction of Shari\'a </p><p>courts over Muslims is mandatory--and has been in the North </p><p>since before the colonial era.  Makarfi said that the </p><p>common law justice system had broken down, especially for </p><p>the poor, who lack access and resources to properly defend </p><p>themselves, or to enforce their rights.  (Note: By most </p><p>accounts, the Shari\'a court system throughout the North is </p><p>itself dysfunctional.  End Note.)  The Ambassador asked </p><p>whether a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of </p><p>criminal Shari\'a would help at this point.  Makarfi said </p><p>that such a ruling would have been helpful initially, but </p><p>that now the issue has "settled down." </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Infrastructure and Economic Development </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (U)  Makarfi began by indicating an interest in </p><p>concluding a sister city arrangement with an appropriately </p><p>sized and diverse U.S. city.  He then discussed his </p><p>budgetary priorities, and described his successes in rural </p><p>electrification, provision of potable water and road- </p><p>building.  (Comment:  Post can confirm that this is not </p><p>mere rhetoric, but that a substantial portion of Kaduna\'s </p><p>budget is in fact being used to establish and expand </p><p>infrastructure throughout the State.  End Comment.) </p><p>Makarfi said that he was focusing on solid minerals </p><p>exploitation and expanding development in the agricultural </p><p>sector.  He commented that the agricultural sector had the </p><p>greatest direct impact on average Nigerians, but said that </p><p>the federal government had neglected to invest in </p><p>transportation infrastructure and market development that </p><p>would permit large-scale agricultural exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Makarfi said that one of his biggest projects was </p><p>to create a "massive" irrigation system that would permit </p><p>year-round farming in much of Kaduna State.  He said the </p><p>lack of a functioning rail system, as well as the </p><p>difficulties in clearing goods through customs, inhibited </p><p>the agricultural export sector.  Makarfi stated that he was </p><p>working to create agricultural co-operatives that would be </p><p>able to enter into export agreements with European buyers </p><p>and guarantee supply.  While Makarfi acknowledged that this </p><p>would be a long-term project, he said that agricultural </p><p>development was in fact the most important sector for </p><p>bettering the lives of average Nigerians.  (Note: </p><p>Nigerians not involved in the oil economy live on an </p><p>average of 1 USD per day.  End Note.)  Makarfi also </p><p>mentioned that Kaduna State owns a "state-of-the-art" </p><p>canning facility in Zaria that he wants to privatize as </p><p>part of his effort to revitalize the agricultural sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  The Governor said that he was particularly </p><p>interested in recruiting U.S. mining companies to look into </p><p>the feasibility of mineral extraction in Kaduna State.  He </p><p>mentioned that Libyan officials had been showing interest, </p><p>but expressed concern that their presence might not be in </p><p>the long-term best interests of the state.  He mentioned </p><p>that there were commercially viable quantities of precious </p><p>and semi-precious metals in Kaduna, and said that Kaduna </p><p>State would not present the same security risks as </p><p>Nigeria\'s South-South, where the oil industry is based. </p><p>The Ambassador agreed to provide any U.S. Geological Survey </p><p>information to the Governor, and said that he would refer </p><p>the Governor\'s request to the U.S. Commercial Service. </p><p>---------- </p><p>Corruption </p><p>---------- </p><p>6. (C)  Ambassador Jeter noted that many Nigerians appeared </p><p>cynical about what they consider to be an ineffective and </p><p>rapacious Fourth Republic federal government, as well as </p><p>equally incompetent local government authorities.  He added </p><p>that in some states, like Kaduna, Nigerians who were </p><p>cynical about the local and federal governments appeared to </p><p>feel greater allegiance to State governments that were </p><p>actually delivering services to the populous.  The </p><p>Ambassador then asked Makarfi how he managed his budget to </p><p>ensure that State funds were invested rather than </p><p>misappropriated.  In reply, Makarfi said that his </p><p>background was in finance and private banking, having been </p><p>the Commissioner of Finance in Kaduna under the </p><p>administration of military governor Colonel Jafa\'ar Isa. </p><p>Makarfi emphasized that he knows how to read a balance </p><p>sheet, and said that he personally reviews and approves all </p><p>contracts let by the Kaduna State government.  He said, "I </p><p>know what it costs to get something done." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Makarfi said that when President Obasanjo came to </p><p>visit Kaduna State last Autumn, he asked how Makarfi </p><p>managed to get so much accomplished with no more money that </p><p>is given to any other state government.  Makarfi said that </p><p>he told the President that the states have adequate funding </p><p>to accomplish a great deal.  It is managing the money--and </p><p>the contracts it is spent on--that is the challenge. </p><p>Makarfi also commented on the difficulty in monitoring the </p><p>corrupt practices of local governments, which have </p><p>independent budgetary allocations coming from the federal </p><p>government.  He said that early in his tenure as Governor </p><p>he picked the most rapacious among the local government </p><p>chairmen in Kaduna, ordered the police to investigate the </p><p>financial practices of the LGA, and then referred him to </p><p>the State Assembly for removal, which it did.  Makarfi said </p><p>this put the other LGA chairmen on notice that their </p><p>activities would be monitored, and punished for corruption </p><p>and wrongdoing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Makarfi added that the National Association of </p><p>Local Governments was "lobbying" the National Assembly to </p><p>pass a bill guaranteeing LGA chairmen a four-year tenure, </p><p>which would prevent their removal by State Assemblies for </p><p>malfeasance.  Makarfi said that nearly 400 million naira </p><p>(3.07 million USD) had been spent in direct payments to </p><p>Assembly members to ensure passage of the bill, which he </p><p>added, would be unconstitutional unless presented in the </p><p>form of a constitutional amendment to remove the oversight </p><p>function of state governments over their LGA\'s.  (Comment: </p><p>LGA\'s and State government budgets, when not properly </p><p>administered, represent a substantial drain of GON </p><p>resources into private pockets.  In the FY 2001 budget, </p><p>LGA\'s will receive 218 billion naira (1.67 billion USD), 20 </p><p>percent of the federal budget, and States will receive 262 </p><p>billion naira (2 billion USD), or 28 percent of the federal </p><p>budget.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Discussing corruption, Makarfi said that he was </p><p>disappointed in the lack of oversight being exercised over </p><p>federal Ministries.  Criticizing some of the current </p><p>Ministers, Makarfi asserted "the President is being mis- </p><p>used by his advisors."  He said, "If the Ministries in </p><p>Abuja simply applied the oversight that I do here in </p><p>Kaduna, a great deal of corruption could be eliminated." </p><p>The Ambassador commented on the fact that Governors had </p><p>become a powerful independent political force in the Fourth </p><p>Republic.  Makarfi agreed that it was a new phenomenon, and </p><p>traced it to the efforts of PDP governors to get President </p><p>Obasanjo elected.  He said that part of the President\'s </p><p>problem in managing what Makarfi described as a largely </p><p>corrupt and undisciplined Cabinet stems from the fact that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s Ministers were nominated in repayment of </p><p>political debts and as an attempt to adhere to strict </p><p>"zoning" by geographical region.  Makarfi said that they </p><p>are not themselves electable, and many of them are spending </p><p>a great deal of time, and government money, trying to </p><p>position themselves as potential candidates for Governor in </p><p>their home states.  (Note: State Governors in Nigeria are </p><p>superior to Ministers in official protocol and most </p><p>exercise more effective power than federal Ministers.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Comment:  Governor Makarfi is one of President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s favorites.  The Governor and his more </p><p>progressive colleagues represent a new development in the </p><p>Nigerian democratic experiment.  To the extent that </p><p>ordinary Nigerians are experiencing a "democracy dividend," </p><p>it appears to derive from effective State governments run </p><p>by executives, like Makarfi, who claim to keep an eye on </p><p>the bottom line.  We are not in a position at this point to </p><p>assess definitively which Governors are in the vanguard of </p><p>good government and which are engaging in business-as-usual </p><p>while claiming to be advocates of good government.  We also </p><p>cannot independently verify Makarfi\'s assertions of clean </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  What we see on the gound, however, indicates that </p><p>a larger amount of Kaduna State money may be going to fund </p><p>projects than into officials\' bank accounts.  Makarfi </p><p>described himself as the wealthiest man in Kaduna State at </p><p>the time he was elected, and therefore can afford to be </p><p>clean, as he does not have to make his fortune during his </p><p>tenure as Governor.  As we identify Governors who are </p><p>delivering services to their constituents--and combating </p><p>corruption--it would seem appropriate to support them and </p><p>good governance by targeting some of assistance efforts to </p><p>those states.
