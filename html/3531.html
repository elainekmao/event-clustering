<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001885 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (COX, DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OIIP, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CRITICIZES POWELL; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   A group of African-Americans, who flew into the </p><p>      country last week at the invitation of the Zimbabwean </p><p>      government, has accused U. S. Secretary of State Colin </p><p>      Powell of extreme dislike of Africa.  According to an </p><p>      article carried on page two of the August 19 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald," Mr. Elombe Brath </p><p>      of the Patrice Lumumba Coalition said: "I went to the same </p><p>      school with Powell and everyone knew that he never had any </p><p>      love for Africa."  Excerpts of the article published under </p><p>      headline "`Powell has never loved Africa\'" follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "U. S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has never had </p><p>      any love or appreciation for Africa and therefore will </p><p>      never do or say anything positive about the continent, a </p><p>      visiting American said yesterday.  Mr. Elombe Brath of the </p><p>      Patrice Lumumba Coalition said he knew Mr. Powell well </p><p>      enough as they grew up together in the U. S.  `I went to </p><p>      the same school with Powell and everyone knew that he never </p><p>      had any love for Africa,\' Mr. Brath said during a meeting </p><p>      with the ZANU PF national chairman and Minister of Home </p><p>      Affairs, (Mr.) John Nkomo, at the party headquarters.  `We </p><p>      went to the same church and lived along the same street and </p><p>      he is known for his views against Africa. . .\'  According </p><p>      to him, Mr. Powell was being `used\' by the U. S. </p><p>      administration in its fight against the `people of color. </p><p>      The Washington system says blacks have no rights.\'  Mr. </p><p>      Powell, who was branded as an `Uncle Tom\' and `White House </p><p>      nigger\' by South African students during a visit to that </p><p>      country early last year, went on to attack President Mugabe </p><p>      and his government.  "He criticized the ongoing land reform </p><p>      program and accused (Mr.) Mugabe of `clinging to power.\' </p><p> </p><p>  3.   "Mr, Brath said that most average black people knew </p><p>      that (Mr.) Mugabe was the most `dangerous\' person in </p><p>      that his views were `inimical\' to the interests of </p><p>      Western powers while advancing those of blacks. </p><p>      `President Mugabe is on the verge of making history </p><p>      in Africa.  He is an example for the whole of the </p><p>      continent.  For instance, he made the correct </p><p>      decision to intervene in the Democratic Republic of </p><p>      Congo, which in history will become one of the most </p><p>      important decisions ever made.\'  He also scoffed at </p><p>      the U. S. presidential election, saying it was a </p><p>      `mockery\' for anyone to say Mr. George Bush was </p><p>      fairly elected. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
