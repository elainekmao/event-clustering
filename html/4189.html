<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 007847 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS RALLY ON ELECTION RESULTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On November 4, Turkish markets reacted positively to </p><p>the AK Party\'s landslide victory in parliamentary elections. </p><p>The lira strengthened very slightly, closing at TL 1,678,000 </p><p>to the dollar; the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index closed </p><p>up 6.1 percent; the benchmark lira T-bills closed unchanged </p><p>at 64 percent in annual compounded terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The local T-bill market weakened in the morning, </p><p>but by afternoon was attracting buyers (rumors say AK Bank, </p><p>already the largest holder of Turkish bonds, was buying). </p><p>Market participants expect strong demand in two Treasury </p><p>auctions to be held November 5, ahead of the November 6 TL 6 </p><p>quadrillion (about $3.5 billion) redemption.  Foreign </p><p>investors will likely join these auctions, per JP </p><p>Morgan/Chase Treasurer Gumisdis who expects rates to decline </p><p>to 62-63 tomorrow.  Yapi Kredi Treasurer Huseyin Imece told </p><p>us some potential investors stayed out of the market today, </p><p>given the normal thin volumes, but will likely jump in </p><p>tomorrow in the large auctions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment: Turkish market contacts across the board </p><p>caution that the initial optimism with AK\'s single party </p><p>government could quickly fade.   Gumisdis said the markets </p><p>will focus on who AK appoints to be "economy minister" adding </p><p>that AK old-timers, like Ali Coskun, are not confidence </p><p>enhancing.  However, many of the AK young guard, like Ali </p><p>Babacan, will be fine. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
