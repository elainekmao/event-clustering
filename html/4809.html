<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002440 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/OSAC, DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PINS, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: EXTORTION LETTER DELIVERED TO COCA-COLA\'S LOCAL </p><p>MANAGER -- KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2369 </p><p> </p><p>1.  On 17 December,  Mr. N.N. Singh (source protect), the </p><p>head of Coca Cola\'s Nepal operations, told RSO that he had </p><p>received a letter purporting to be from the Maoists and </p><p>"requesting...financial support of" 3 million Nepali Rupees </p><p>(NRs).  Singh stated that he had received the letter several </p><p>days earlier, but has been busy dealing with the death of his </p><p>brother (Hindu death rituals require several days activities </p><p>before returning to normal business).  He provided a copy of </p><p>the letter, a translation thereof, and showed the RSO the </p><p>original.  He expressed greater concern over this extortion </p><p>attempt than those in the past, observing that this letter </p><p>was delivered to his home as opposed to his office.  Singh </p><p>stated that he is concerned for his personal safety and that </p><p>of his business.  He told RSO that he has been in contact </p><p>with Coca Cola security officials in Atlanta regarding this </p><p>matter. </p><p> </p><p>2.  RSO offered to contact host country security services on </p><p>Coca Cola\'s behalf and ask for additional security.  Singh </p><p>told RSO that he did not want a GON bodyguard nor a physical </p><p>presence of GON security personnel at either his home or </p><p>office; his preference is for increased Royal Nepalese Army </p><p>(RNA) patrolling in the vicinity of his residence, citing </p><p>lack of confidence in the police.  RSO has passed this </p><p>request through DAtt. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Singh told RSO of his involvement in recent talks between </p><p>Nepal\'s largest chamber of commerce (FNCCI) and the RNA over </p><p>establishment of a new industrial security force.  He said </p><p>that the RNA has asked businesses to front 850 million NRs to </p><p>fund the force\'s creation.  Singh lamented that in the </p><p>current business environment it is not possible for </p><p>businesses to contribute so much, comparing the figure to the </p><p>Maoists\' high extortion demands.  He expressed doubt as to </p><p>when, if ever, the industrial security force would become a </p><p>reality. </p><p> </p><p>4.  RSO compared the copy of the extortion letter to one Post </p><p>has on record, which was received by an AmCit business owner </p><p>on December 2 (ref).  The letters are identical with the </p><p>exception of the pre-lined areas filled in by hand </p><p>(addressee, address, reference number, amount of money </p><p>requested).  RSO noted that the handwriting contained in the </p><p>pre-lined sections did not match with the handwriting </p><p>contained in the first letter.  RSO assesses the letter </p><p>presented by Singh as an authentic Maoist extortion letter </p><p>and has passed this assessment on to him. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Post notes that extortion by the Maoists seems to be on </p><p>the rise after a several month hiatus.  Singh\'s pessimistic </p><p>outlook on both the economy and security situation are </p><p>similar to those held by many of Post\'s contacts.  Whether </p><p>this renewed drive for money signals financial difficulties </p><p>for the insurgents or an attempt to build funds for a new </p><p>push against the GON, as they state in their correspondence, </p><p>is unclear.  However, the frustration and feeling of dilemma </p><p>rampant in the business community is crystalline. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
