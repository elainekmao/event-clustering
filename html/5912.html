<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001182 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/PCI PAYNE; IP/G/NEA CBOURGEOIS, JGAFFNEY; </p><p>ECA/R RUTH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KGLB, SENV, SCUL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON JORDAN GLOBE PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) SECSTATE 06351     B) 2002 AMMAN 4426 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PER REF A, POST HAS IMPRESSED UPON THE LOCAL GLOBE </p><p>COORDINATOR THE IMPORTANCE OF JORDANIAN STUDENTS AND </p><p>TEACHERS ATTENDING THE UPCOMING GLOBE LEARNING EXPEDITION IN </p><p>CROATIA.  THROUGH THE NEA REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT OFFICE (REO), </p><p>BASED IN AMMAN, WE ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN ASSISTING THE </p><p>JORDAN GLOBE PROGRAM IN NUMEROUS WAYS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR EXAMPLE, UPON A REQUEST FROM THE REO IN 1999, A </p><p>LOCAL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE FREE </p><p>INTERNET ACCESS FOR 13 UNDERPRIVILEGED GLOBE SCHOOLS IN </p><p>JORDAN.  THIS HAS ALLOWED THE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS TO MORE </p><p>EASILY CONDUCT THE DATA ENTRY AND DATA SHARING THAT IS </p><p>CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF GLOBE\'S MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN JANUARY 2002, GLOBE JORDAN INTRODUCED ITS PROGRAM TO </p><p>JORDANIAN SCIENTISTS AT A PUBLIC FORUM THROUGH PRESENTATIONS </p><p>BY THE GLOBE COORDINATOR AND STUDENTS.   AT THE SAME EVENT, </p><p>THE REO ENCOURAGED JORDANIAN PROFESSORS AND SCIENTISTS TO </p><p>PARTNER WITH GLOBE SCHOOLS AND ACT AS MENTORS FOR GLOBE </p><p>STUDENTS.  SCIENTISTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO USE GLOBE DATA FROM </p><p>LOCAL SCHOOLS IN THEIR RESEARCH, IF POSSIBLE, AND TO EXPOSE </p><p>GLOBE STUDENTS TO WAYS IN WHICH THEIR DATA CAN HAVE </p><p>APPLICATION IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.  THE REO PROMOTED THESE </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN GLOBE SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS OF </p><p>HIGHER LEARNING TO BROADEN JORDANIAN YOUTH\'S UNDERSTANDING </p><p>AND APPRECIATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY 5 </p><p>UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS WHO ARE DONATING THEIR TIME TO THE </p><p>JORDAN GLOBE PROGRAM AND ACTING AS ADVISORS TO STUDENTS WITH </p><p>THEIR DATA COLLECTION AND PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  POST ALSO HAS ENCOURAGED THE JORDAN GLOBE PROGRAM TO </p><p>CONSIDER CONDUCTING REGIONAL PROJECTS INVOLVING GLOBE </p><p>STUDENTS FROM SEVERAL NEA COUNTRIES COLLABORATING ON A </p><p>COMMON ISSUE.  TO THIS END, IN JUNE 2002, GLOBE JORDAN </p><p>HOSTED A REGIONAL WORKSHOP IN AQABA WITH GLOBE STUDENTS AND </p><p>TEACHERS FROM LEBANON AND BAHRAIN.  A SECOND REGIONAL GLOBE </p><p>WORKSHOP, ORGANIZED BY GLOBE JORDAN, FOR STUDENTS FROM </p><p>LEBANON, BAHRAIN AND JORDAN WAS HOSTED IN LEBANON IN JULY </p><p>2002.  THE EGYPT GLOBE PROGRAM ALSO SENT AN OBSERVER TO THIS </p><p>EVENT, FOLLOWING REO\'S MEETING IN CAIRO WITH GLOBE </p><p>COORDINATORS AND EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS IN APRIL 2002. THE </p><p>SERIES OF WORKSHOPS FOCUSED ON SEAWATER CHARACTERISTICS, FOR </p><p>WHICH THE STUDENTS PRODUCED COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REPORTS AND A </p><p>JOINT "COMPARATIVE STUDY PAPER" ON THE TOPIC.  A THIRD </p><p>FOLLOW-UP WORKSHOP, INVOLVING JORDAN, LEBANON, BAHRAIN, </p><p>EGYPT, AND SAUDI ARABIA (AS OBSERVER), HAD BEEN SCHEDULED </p><p>FOR FEBRUARY 2003 IN BAHRAIN, BUT WAS POSTPONED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE REO FACILITATED A MEETING BETWEEN GLOBE JORDAN AND </p><p>EMBASSY AMMAN PUBLIC DIPLOMACY TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>ASSISTING GLOBE THROUGH EXISTING EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.  REO AND </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY HAVE ENCOURAGED THE GLOBE COORDINATOR TO </p><p>SUBMIT A PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING THROUGH MEPI.  WE ARE ALSO </p><p>EXPLORING USING THE SISTER CITIES INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM AS </p><p>ANOTHER MEANS TO LINK JORDANIAN GLOBE STUDENTS WITH THEIR </p><p>AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP GLOBE JORDAN OVERCOME THE </p><p>FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IT HAS HAD IN RAISING FUNDS TO PURCHASE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC KITS AND CONDUCT ACTIVITIES, THE REO OFFERED A </p><p>GRANT WRITING WORKSHOP FOR JORDANIAN NGO\'S AND OFFICIALS, </p><p>AMONG WHOM WERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM GLOBE, IN AUGUST 2002 </p><p>(REF B).  WE HAVE ALSO PUT THE GLOBE JORDAN COORDINATOR IN </p><p>TOUCH WITH LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE SO THAT THEY CAN </p><p>SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROGRAM.  FINALLY, WE ARE </p><p>COORDINATING WITH THE FOREIGN COMMERCIAL SERVICE AT EMBASSY </p><p>AMMAN TO INTRODUCE THE GLOBE PROGRAM TO THE JORDAN AMERICAN </p><p>BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AS A POSSIBLE RECIPIENT OF CORPORATE </p><p>GOOD CITIZENSHIP.  BY RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT GLOBE, </p><p>WE HOPE TO ENCOURAGE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO PLAY AN </p><p>ACTIVE ROLE IN SUPPORTING GLOBE ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. BACKGROUND ON GLOBE PROGRAM IN JORDAN:  THE GLOBE/JORDAN </p><p>AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON OCTOBER 31, 1996, BETWEEN THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF MUNICIPALITIES, RURAL AFFAIRS AND THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO JORDAN.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY DESIGNATED A JORDANIAN NGO, THE FRIENDS OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY (FOE), TO COORDINATE AND IMPLEMENT GLOBE </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT JORDAN.  THERE ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY 23 SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN GLOBE. </p><p> </p><p>8.   THE FOE IS A NON-PROFIT, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1994 AND IS DEDICATED TO ENCOURAGING </p><p>YOUTH TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN CONSERVING AND IMPROVING </p><p>THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  IT HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE COORDINATOR OF THE </p><p>GLOBE PROGRAM, INCLUDING PROVIDING STAFF TRAINING FOR </p><p>FLEDGLING GLOBE PROGRAMS IN OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
