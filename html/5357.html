<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000218 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, SNAR, PHUM, ETRD, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH PRESIDENTIAL PRE-CANDIDATE </p><p>ALVARO COLOM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David E. Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) At a January 24 breakfast meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>presidential pre-candate Alvaro Colom of the center-left </p><p>Union for National Hope Party (UNE) said that the main </p><p>challenge for the winner in this year\'s presidential election </p><p>will be to jump-start the economy and to shut down the </p><p>transnational criminal mafias that currently have so much </p><p>influence in the government.  He said that he would be </p><p>meeting with PAN presidential pre-candidate Oscar Berger </p><p>later that day to begin talks on an agreement to make these </p><p>the focus of their common campaign against the ruling FRG. </p><p>Colom dismissed rumors of his joining forces with the PAN </p><p>during the first round of the election, but said that a </p><p>second round alliance is already being discussed.  Colom </p><p>believes he currently has 17% of the vote, though polls we </p><p>have seen show him at between 5% and 12%.  Colom does not </p><p>expect electoral fraud on voting day to be significant, but </p><p>believes the FRG is already "stacking the deck" by wooing the </p><p>ex-PAC\'s and others with irresponsible financial promises. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador told Colom that we share his concerns </p><p>over the influence of organized crime as well as his interest </p><p>in promoting economic growth.  The Ambassador discussed our </p><p>support for the idea of setting up a commission, under the </p><p>auspices of the UN/OAS, to investigate the operations of </p><p>"clandestine groups."  He noted that we look forward to </p><p>working with the winner of the next election to curb the </p><p>influence of these transnational criminal mafias.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that the best hope for reducing poverty in </p><p>the region was the successful negotiation of a free trade </p><p>agreement between Central America and the United States.  A </p><p>free trade agreement would meet opposition from sectors of </p><p>U.S. society concerned about the situation of human and labor </p><p>rights in Guatemala, the lack of resolution of the cases of </p><p>11 Amcits murdered since 1999 and the lack of cooperation in </p><p>the war against drugs.  It is critical that there be </p><p>significant progress in these areas before CAFTA can be </p><p>concluded.  Colom agreed, and said that his party is a big </p><p>supporter of CAFTA (Note: In private life, Colom is an </p><p>apparel exporter. End note). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  Colom won 20% of the vote in the 1999 </p><p>elections and, despite the subsequent fracturing of </p><p>Guatemala\'s left, continues to have significant popular </p><p>support.  It is too early to guess whether his movement can </p><p>make it into the second round of elections, but at a minimum </p><p>the votes of his supporters will be critical in a tightly </p><p>fought race. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
