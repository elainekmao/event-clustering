<p>S E C R E T  STATE 368870 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR KOLKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: ANC, SF, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH ANC LEADER THABO MBEKI </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 319466 (NOTAL) </p><p></p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p></p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ANC INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR THABO </p><p>MBEKI MADE HIS SECOND VISIT TO WASHINGTON IN AS MANY </p><p>MONTHS NOVEMBER 9 - 14.  MIXING CALLS IN WASHINGTON WITH </p><p>TRAVEL ELSEWHERE (HE ARRIVED IN NEW YORK NOVEMBER 1), </p><p>MBEKI OFFICIALLY OPENED THE ANC\'S WASHINGTON OFFICE WITH </p><p>A RECEPTION HOSTED BY CONGRESSMAN DELLUMS ON NOV 9 AND </p><p>HAD MEETINGS AT THE DEPARTMENT ON NOV 13.  IN A MEETING </p><p>WITH ACTING AF ASSISTANT SECRETARY WARREN CLARK, MBEKI </p><p>SAID THAT THE RECENT RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS </p><p>BEGUN A PROCESS THAT IS BOUND TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT </p><p>ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S FUTURE.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED TO ARGUE </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT DE KLERK DOES NOT DESERVE CREDIT FOR THESE </p><p>AND OTHER RECENT POSITIVE MOVES.  EXPANDING ON REMARKS </p><p>MADE IN OCTOBER TO AS COHEN (REFTEL), MBEKI ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED THE ANC ACCEPTS THE NEED FOR BOTH SIDES TO </p><p>COMPROMISE ON THE ISSUE OF GROUPS.  HE INDICATED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT WHILE COMPROMISE ON CULTURAL/EDUCATION </p><p>ISSUES MAY BE POSSIBLE (THOUGH DIFFICULT), SCHEMES TO </p><p>PROTECT WHITE POLITICAL POWER ARE UNACCEPTABLE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p></p><p>------------------ </p><p>LEGALIZING THE ANC </p><p>------------------ </p><p></p><p>3.  HA ASSISTANT SECRETARY SCHIFTER, NSC STAFFER DAVID </p><p>PASSAGE, S/P STAFFER WALTER KANSTEINER, AF/S DIRECTOR </p><p>PERITO AND AF/S OIC GALLUCCI ALSO PARTICIPATED IN CLARK\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH MBEKI.  MBEKI TOLD THE ASSEMBLY THAT ONE </p><p>COULD NOT DISMISS RECENT MOVES BY DE KLERK TO FREE </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ALLOW PEACEFUL PROTEST AS SIMPLY </p><p>COSMETIC.  DE KLERK, HE SAID, HAS OBVIOUSLY BEGUN A </p><p>PROCESS THAT CANNOT BE STOPPED.  IT MUST LEAD AT SOME </p><p>POINT TO LEGALIZATION OF THE ANC.  THE RELEASED LEADERS </p><p>ARE UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE TO BE LEADERS OF THE ANC.  IN </p><p>FACT, CONTINUED MBEKI, THE ANC WILL ANNOUNCE SHORTLY THAT </p><p>THE RELEASED SENIORS ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL ANC </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND WILL ACT FOR AND SPEAK FOR THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION IN SOUTH AFRICA.  OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS </p><p>LESS PROMINENT BUT ALSO JAILED BECAUSE OF THEIR ANC </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO READY TO PLAY A ROLE.  THESE ARE THE </p><p>INGREDIENTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL ANC MEMBERSHIP INSIDE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA. </p><p></p><p>4.  MBEKI SUGGESTED THAT THIS INTERNAL ANC WILL OPERATE </p><p>OPENLY AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN HAVE TO LIFT </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON THE UDF AND OTHERS.  THIS WILL ALLOW THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO BEGIN ORGANIZING.  THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS </p><p>THAT THIS PROCESS MUST LEAD SOON TO NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE </p><p>THE ANC WILL GROW STRONGER AS IT EXPANDS OPEN </p><p>OPERATIONS.  THE SAG ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT IT CANNOT </p><p>RELEASE MANDELA UNTIL IT IS READY FOR NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO MBEKI, MANDELA\'S RELEASE WILL </p><p>SIGNAL THAT DE KLERK IS READY. </p><p></p><p>---------------------- </p><p>EVALUATION OF DE KLERK </p><p>---------------------- </p><p></p><p>5.  WHILE HE ACCEPTED THAT THIS PROCESS WILL HAVE GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE FOR SOUTH AFRICA, MBEKI REFUSED TO CREDIT DE </p><p>KLERK WITH GOOD INTENTIONS.  REFERRING TO DE KLERK\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH "THE PRIESTS" (TUTU, BOESAK AND CHIKANE), </p><p>MBEKI SAID THAT IT IS STILL AN EDUCATION PROCESS FOR </p><p>F.W.  WHILE DE KLERK LECTURED THE PRIESTS FOR THE FIRST </p><p>30 MINUTES OF THEIR MEETING ON HOW THEY HANDLED THE </p><p>PRESS, THERE WAS THEN A GOOD DISCUSSION ON WHAT THE SAG </p><p>MUST DO.  MBEKI REMARKED THAT IN THEIR REPORT ON THE </p><p>MEETING, THE PRIESTS NOTED THAT WHILE THIS DISCUSSION DID </p><p>NOT APPEAR TO BE NEW GROUND FOR GERRIT VILJOEN, DE KLERK </p><p>WAS NOT AWARE OF THE ISSUES.  MBEKI REPEATED HIS ARGUMENT </p><p>THAT DE KLERK REMAINS WEDDED TO THE GROUPS CONCEPT AND </p><p>HAS UNDERTAKEN POSITIVE STEPS ONLY IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PRESSURE.  (NOTE:  THIS WAS THE </p><p>CLOSEST MBEKI CAME TO DIRECTLY RAISING THE SANCTIONS </p><p>ISSUE.) </p><p></p><p>---------- </p><p>COMPROMISE </p><p>---------- </p><p></p><p>6.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PLACE OF </p><p>GROUPS IN SOUTH AFRICA, MBEKI NOTED THAT THE POLITICAL </p><p>STRUGGLE IN SOUTH AFRICA IS REALLY ONE BETWEEN THOSE </p><p>COMMITTED TO A NON-RACIAL SOUTH AFRICA AND THOSE WHO SEEK </p><p>THE PROTECTION OF GROUPS.  IN THE END, HE SAID, IT WILL </p><p>COME DOWN TO THESE TWO SIDES FACING EACH OTHER AT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATING TABLE.  BUT MBEKI SAID HE ALSO RECOGNIZED </p><p>THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPROMISE ON BOTH SIDES.  HE </p><p>VENTURED THAT IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP SOME FORMULA </p><p>TO GUARANTEE LANGUAGE RIGHTS.  BUT THIS WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE SINCE IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO </p><p>MANY TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM IN WHICH SEPARATE STREAMS OF </p><p>CHILDREN GO OFF TO THEIR SEPARATE AFRIKANER AND </p><p>ZULU-LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.  THE IDEAL SITUATION, MBEKI </p><p>CONTINUED, WOULD BE FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN POPULATION TO </p><p>MIX.  BUT THE RIGHT TO PEOPLE\'S OWN CULTURE, LANGUAGE AND </p><p>RELIGION MUST BE GRANTED.  ACCEPTING THIS REALITY IS ONLY </p><p>THE FIRST STEP.  THE HARD PART WOULD BE "CODIFYING" THESE </p><p>RIGHTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COMMON SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>WITHOUT RETREATING TO SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MBEKI INDICATED THAT POLITICAL COMPROMISE WOULD BE </p><p>MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.  HE REJECTED OUT-OF-HAND AN UPPER </p><p>HOUSE FOR GROUP REPRESENTATION OR ANY ATTEMPT TO WRITE A </p><p>"GROUP REPRESENTATION" CONSTITUTION.  VIS-A-VIS THE </p><p>LATTER, MBEKI SPECIFICALLY REJECTED ANY GROUP-BASED </p><p>FEDERALISM, ARGUING THAT THE ISSUE OF FEDERALISM IN </p><p>GENERAL IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN CONTEXT THE EMERGENCE OF RACIAL MINI-STATES.  HE </p><p>INDICATED HOWEVER THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED PROVINCES </p><p>MIGHT MAKE SENSE.  ON THE MATTER OF PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>REPRESENTATION, MBEKI SAID THAT A ZIMBABWE-TYPE SOLUTION </p><p>OF RESERVED SEATS WOULD NOT BE IDEAL.  "OUR WHITE </p><p>COMPATRIOTS", HE NOTED, SEE THIS AS PUTTING THE WHITES </p><p>"OUT OF THE LOOP."  BUT IN THE END, SUGGESTED MBEKI, THAT </p><p>MIGHT HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. </p><p></p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>HOMELAND LEADERS AND BUTHELEZI </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p></p><p>8.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM AMBASSADOR SHIFTER, </p><p>MBEKI REPEATED AGAIN THE NEW ANC HARD LINE ON CHIEF </p><p>BUTHELEZI.  HE SUGGESTED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO </p><p>SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AT THE SIDE OF HOMELAND </p><p>LEADERS SUCH AS TRANSKEI GENERAL HOLOMISA THAN WITH </p><p>BUTHELEZI.  ACCORDING TO MBEKI, HOLOMISA SHARES THE </p><p>NON-RACIAL COMMITMENT AND WOULD NOT SEEK TO REPRESENT THE </p><p>TRANSKEI HOMELAND AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  (MBEKI SAID </p><p>THAT IN ALL, SIX OF THE 10 HOMELANDS LEADERS ARE IN THE </p><p>NON-RACIAL CAMP.  HE ADDED AT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT MEETING </p><p>THAT THE ANC BELIEVED IT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TO </p><p>INCLUDE HOMELAND LEADERS HOLOMISA AND ENOS MABUZA IN THE </p><p>CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC FUTURE THAN SMALL BLACK </p><p>CONSCIOUSNESS AND AFRICANIST GROUPS.)  WHILE BUTHELEZI </p><p>WOULD BE IN PRINCIPLE WELCOME IF HE MADE THE SAME </p><p>COMMITMENT, AT PRESENT, MBEKI SAID, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT </p><p>TO SEE HIM IN THIS LIGHT WHILE HE IS NOT COOPERATING IN </p><p>EFFORTS TO BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE IN NATAL. </p><p></p><p>----------- </p><p>CEASE FIRE? </p><p>----------- </p><p></p><p>9.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, MBEKI SAID THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO ANC DECISION TO DESIST FROM VIOLENCE OR UNDERTAKE A DE </p><p>FACTO CEASEFIRE.  RATHER, THE ANC-MK IS CONCENTRATING ON </p><p>BUILDING A MILITARY CAPABILITY WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA.  THE </p><p>ANC RECOGNIZES THAT ITS WAR FROM OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICA HAS </p><p>BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE.  SO IT HAS GONE FROM BOMBING </p><p>AND HITTING SELECTED TARGETS TO BUILDING A MILITARY MK </p><p>STRUCTURE INSIDE THE COUNTRY. </p><p></p><p>------------- </p><p>ANC/PAC TALKS </p><p>------------- </p><p></p><p>10.  MBEKI DENIED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ANY ANC/PAC </p><p>TALKS.  HE SAID THAT PAC LEADER JEFF MASEMOLA WAS ADDED </p><p>TO THE LIST OF ANC RELEASEES AT THE REQUEST OF NELSON </p><p>MANDELA.  MANDELA THEN MET WITH MASEMOLA TO ASK HIM TO </p><p>BEHAVE PROPERLY UPON HIS RELEASE SO AS NOT TO REFLECT </p><p>BADLY ON POLITICAL PRISONERS.  MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>MASEMOLA HAD FALLEN IN WITH CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHILE </p><p>IMPRISONED.  (MBEKI TOLD AN EARLIER MEETING THAT THE PAC </p><p>IS "IRRELEVANT.") </p><p></p><p>---------------- </p><p>UNGA RESOLUTIONS </p><p>---------------- </p><p></p><p>11.  MBEKI NOTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>COOPERATION AT THE UN TO TRY TO PRODUCE CONSENSUS ON </p><p>POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS.  HE ADDED THAT EVERYONE SHARES THE </p><p>VIEW THAT CONSENSUS AT THE UPCOMING SPECIAL SESSION ON </p><p>APARTHEID IS NECESSARY.  MBEKI ASKED WHAT THE U.S. FINDS </p><p>INAPPROPRIATE IN THE OAU HARARE DECLARATION.  CLARK </p><p>RESPONDED THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE REFERENCES TO AN </p><p>INTERIM GOVERNMENT OR LANGUAGE SUGGESTING THE ANC IS THE </p><p>SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PEOPLE.  CALLS FOR SANCTIONS ARE ALSO UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p>MBEKI SAID THAT SANCTIONS NEED NOT BE MENTIONED IN THE </p><p>SPECIAL SESSION DECLARATION.  HE ALSO THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE </p><p>TO DEAL WITH HOW TO REFER TO THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT POINT WITHOUT USING THAT </p><p>PARTICULAR PHRASE.  AT THE LEAST, MBEKI CONTINUED, WE </p><p>COULD AGREE ON WHAT ELEMENTS ARE IN THE "SPIRIT OF </p><p>HARARE" AND WHAT IS NOT.  HE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE </p><p>ELEMENTS IN THE ANC-DRAFTED DOCUMENT WERE INTENTIONALLY </p><p>DRAWN FROM SECRETARY SHULTZ\'S 1987 SPEECH ON SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>AND BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HOWE\'S 1988 EFFORT.  THE ANC </p><p>WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE REQUEST TO DEFINE BETTER WHAT </p><p>IT IS FOR.  PERITO REPLIED THAT THESE ARE THE ELEMENTS WE </p><p>FOUND POSITIVE AND THE REASON WE SAID SO PUBLICLY.  BUT </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED THAT WE COULD NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING SMACKING </p><p>OF A 435-LIKE EFFORT OR FULL OF PRECONDITIONS.  MBEKI </p><p>INVITED FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE POINTS, PERHAPS IN </p><p>LUSAKA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
