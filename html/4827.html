<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 005465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL AND NEA/ARP </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, AFMLS AND NDDS </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EFIN, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT: 2002-03 INCSR REPORT (FINANCIAL CRIMES AND </p><p>MONEY LAUNDERING) </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 240035 </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Following is Embassy Kuwait\'s submission for the </p><p>2002-2003 INCSR report.  Text is keyed not to specific </p><p>questions but to subject headings in reftel. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) General Questions:  Despite its relative wealth, </p><p>Kuwait is not considered a major financial center nor a \'hot </p><p>spot\' for money laundering.  Nevertheless, as a matter of </p><p>policy and practice, and as a member in the Financial Action </p><p>Task Force (through the Gulf Cooperation Council) the State </p><p>of Kuwait is taking active measures to combat money </p><p>laundering and terrorist finance. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Laws and Regulations to Prevent Money Laundering: </p><p>Money Laundering related to any criminal activity was </p><p>specifically criminalized in February 2002.  Even before the </p><p>passage of the law, bank regulators had strengthened </p><p>\'know-your-customer\' requirements and other rules designed to </p><p>prevent and detect money laundering, such as mandatory </p><p>suspicious transaction reporting, mandatory training for bank </p><p>officers, and so forth.  Such rules apply to all financial </p><p>institutions as defined by the Minister of Finance, to </p><p>include insurance firms and money exchangers.  The new law </p><p>imposes reporting requirements for cross-border currency </p><p>movements, but the implementing regulations for this are </p><p>still being finalized.  The new law also envisions the </p><p>creation of an interagency Financial Intelligence Unit.  To </p><p>our knowledge, there have been no arrests or prosecutions </p><p>specifically on money laundering or terrorist finance charges </p><p>in 2002.  However, two terrorist suspects were charged in </p><p>late 2002 with "gathering funds for, and financing the </p><p>establishment of, military training camps abroad." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Terrorist Finance Section:  The money laundering law </p><p>of 2002 does not specifically cite terrorist financing as a </p><p>crime; however, the definition of criminal activity is </p><p>sufficiently broad so as to allow such interpretation. </p><p>Kuwaiti authorities have complied with their obligations </p><p>under UN resolutions to search for and seize terrorist assets </p><p>(although none have yet been identified in Kuwait).  As </p><p>regards the possible misuse of charity funds, the Kuwaiti </p><p>government did order the freeze of assets of two overseas </p><p>branches of a Kuwaiti charity in January 2002, and is </p><p>developing new regulatory and oversight mechanisms to ensure </p><p>the transparency and accountability of charity operations. </p><p>This includes the creation of a new charity oversight </p><p>department in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. </p><p>Kuwait is not a party to the 1999 International Convention </p><p>for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Offshore Financial Centers:  Kuwait is not considered </p><p>an offshore financial center, nor are offshore banks or </p><p>financial institutions permitted. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) International Cooperation:  There is no formal </p><p>bilateral agreement on record exchanges with U.S. </p><p>authorities, although Kuwaiti law permits such cooperation in </p><p>response to specific requests on the basis of reciprocity. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Asset Forfeiture and Seizure Legislation: The 2002 </p><p>Money Laundering Law allows the broad seizure of assets </p><p>("funds, properties, proceeds and means") as a penalty for </p><p>money laundering crimes.  The law does not stipulate how </p><p>seized assets are to be disposed of. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Asset Seizure Enforcement:  As the implementing </p><p>regulations for the 2002 Money Laundering Law remain </p><p>unfinished, there have been no asset seizures under it. </p><p>However, the Kuwaiti government is working to develop </p><p>effective procedures for tracing and seizing assets within </p><p>the banking sector and beyond. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
