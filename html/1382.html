<p>UNCLAS STATE 228569 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: APER </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL GUIDE TO ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY.  WE IN HR/CDA RECOGNIZE THAT THE ASSIGNMENT </p><p>AND TRANSFER PROCESS CAN BE A COMPLICATED UNDERTAKING.  WE </p><p>WANT TO HELP EMPLOYEES MAKE THESE TRANSITIONS AS SMOOTHLY </p><p>AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE AWARE THAT EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES FACE </p><p>PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF SOME </p><p>IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER ISSUES.  WE HAVE </p><p>PREPARED THIS MESSAGE TO HELP EMPLOYEES AVOID THESE </p><p>PITFALLS.  OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR CDOS </p><p>IN HR/CDA IF OTHER ISSUES NOT INCLUDED HERE SHOULD BE </p><p>ADDED IN THE FUTURE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>TOURS OF DUTY </p><p>2.  RULES ON R&R: ALL EMPLOYEES SERVING IN POSTS WHICH </p><p>HAVE AN R&R SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MUST SERVE AT THE </p><p>POST FOR THE FULL TOUR OF DUTY TO QUALIFY FOR THE R&R(S). </p><p>ANY CURTAILMENT BY ONE MONTH OR MORE RESULTS IN A </p><p>REQUIREMENT TO EITHER REPAY THE R&R OR REQUEST A WAIVER OF </p><p>THE REPAYMENT FROM THEIR CAREER DEVELOPMENT OFFICER (CDO) </p><p>IN HR/CDA.  EVEN IF THE GAINING AND LOSING POST AND THE </p><p>EMPLOYEE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT, THE EMPLOYEE MUST REQUEST </p><p>AN R&R REPAYMENT WAIVER IF S/HE WILL DEPART POST PRIOR TO </p><p>THE LAST MONTH OF THE FULL TOUR OF DUTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HOME LEAVE: EMPLOYEES BECOME ELIGIBLE TO TAKE HOME </p><p>LEAVE AFTER 18 MONTHS SERVICE OVERSEAS.  TIME IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES ON R&R, PERSONAL TRAVEL, OR ANNUAL LEAVE </p><p>DOES NOT COUNT TOWARD THE 18 MONTH REQUIREMENT NOR DOES IT </p><p>RESTART THE CLOCK (SEE 3 FAH-1 H-3434.2).  THUS, AN </p><p>EMPLOYEE WHO IS ASSIGNED OVERSEAS FOR 18 MONTHS MAY NOT BE </p><p>ELIGIBLE FOR HOME LEAVE ON TRANSFER IF VACATION OR R&R </p><p>TIME WAS SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE FACT THAT AN </p><p>EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE FOR HOME LEAVE AFTER 18 MONTHS </p><p>OVERSEAS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN THAT HOME LEAVE WILL </p><p>BE FOLDED INTO THE TOUR OF DUTY.  HOME LEAVE IS NORMALLY </p><p>TAKEN UPON TRANSFER FROM POST OF ASSIGNMENT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HOME LEAVE IS MANDATED BY STATUTE TO BE TAKEN AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE AFTER 36 MONTHS OVERSEAS. FOR THIS REASON, </p><p>EMPLOYEES WITH HOME LEAVE/RETURN FOLDED INTO THEIR TOUR OF </p><p>DUTY SHOULD BE SURE TO TAKE THE HOME LEAVE WHEN INDICATED. </p><p>THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR EMPLOYEES AT R&R POSTS </p><p>WHERE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE HOME LEAVE BE TAKEN AT THE </p><p>MID-POINT IN THE TOUR TO PROTECT ELIGIBILITY FOR R&R. </p><p>EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO TAKE POST TO POST OR </p><p>ROUND TRIP HOME LEAVE TRAVEL MUST GENERALLY SPEND AT LEAST </p><p>20 WORK DAYS IN THE UNITED STATES.  EMPLOYEES MAY REQUEST </p><p>A WAIVER OF THIS HOME LEAVE REQUIREMENT IN ADVANCE. </p><p> </p><p>SEPARATION:  RESIGNATIONS AND RETIREMENTS </p><p>4.  EMPLOYEES FACING SEPARATION, WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR </p><p>INVOLUNTARY, SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO </p><p>REPAY R&R, HOME LEAVE, HOME SERVICE TRANSFER ALLOWANCES, </p><p>DOMESTIC RELOCATION EXPENSES, LONG TERM TRAINING EXPENSES </p><p>AT NON-STATE FACILITIES, PHYSICIANS COMPARABILITY </p><p>ALLOWANCES, OR TO SHIP THEIR OWN EFFECTS IF THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>MET THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS.  PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CDO </p><p>BEFORE MAKING ANY PLANS TO SEPARATE FROM THE FOREIGN </p><p>SERVICE TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT INCURRING AN UNEXPECTED </p><p>EXPENSE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SELECTION OF THE SEPARATION ADDRESS ON THE OF 126 </p><p>RESIDENCY AND DEPENDENCY FORM IS CRITICAL.  THIS ADDRESS </p><p>ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND TO SHIP YOUR HOUSEHOLD EFFECTS.  YOU </p><p>MAY CHANGE THAT ADDRESS UP UNTIL YOUR LAST DAY IN ACTIVE </p><p>DUTY STATUS.  AFTER THAT TIME, YOU HAVE A MAXIMUM OF 18 </p><p>MONTHS (YOU MUST REQUEST THIS EXTENSION) TO SHIP YOUR HHE </p><p>TO ITS FINAL DESTINATION.  IF THAT FINAL DESTINATION IS </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM THE SEPARATION ADDRESS ON YOUR OF 126, YOUR </p><p>HHE WILL BE SHIPPED ON A COST-CONSTRUCTIVE BASIS TO THE </p><p>FINAL DESTINATION. </p><p>6.  NEW APPOINTEES SIGN AN AGREEMENT TO REMAIN IN THE </p><p>SERVICE FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THEY ENTER ON DUTY. </p><p>SHOULD AN EMPLOYEE RESIGN PRIOR TO THAT ONE-YEAR MARK, </p><p>REPAYMENT OF ALL/ALL APPOINTMENT TRAVEL EXPENSES (FROM </p><p>PLACE OF RESIDENCE AT TIME OF APOINTMENT THROUGH TRAINING </p><p>PER DIEM TO TRAVEL AND SHIPMENT TO FIRST PERMANENT DUTY </p><p>STATION) MUST BE MADE.  NEW APPOINTEES ARE REQUIRED TO </p><p>COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TWO-YEAR FIRST OVERSEAS TOUR (OR ONE </p><p>YEAR OF THE SECOND OVERSEAS TOUR) TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>SEPARATION TRAVEL ORDERS AND SHIPMENT OF EFFECTS BACK TO </p><p>THE U.S. </p><p>7.  EMPLOYEES CANNOT TAKE ANNUAL LEAVE JUST PRIOR TO </p><p>SEPARATION FROM THE FOREIGN SERVICE.  SEE 3 FAM 3416. </p><p>8.  EMPLOYEES SHOULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEIR </p><p>RETIREMENT COUNSELOR IN HR/RET DURING SEPARATION </p><p>CONSULTATIONS.  HR/RET HANDLES COLLECTION OF STATE ID </p><p>BADGES, DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS, QUESTIONS ON ANNUITIES/TSP, </p><p>ETC. </p><p> </p><p>AWAY FROM POST EDUCATION ALLOWANCE </p><p>9.  THE STANDARDIZED REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT AN EMPLOYEE </p><p>BE AT POST BEFORE ANY PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE FOR EDUCATION </p><p>ALLOWANCE.  THIS MEANS THAT IF AN EFM WILL REMAIN IN THE </p><p>SAME BOARDING SCHOOL WHILE THE EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS FROM ONE </p><p>POST TO ANOTHER, NO FURTHER PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE UNTIL THE </p><p>EMPLOYEE ARRIVES AT THE NEW POST, AND THE MAXIMUM RATE </p><p>AUTHORIZED MAY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE MOVE TO A NEW </p><p>POST.  THE BOARDING SCHOOL MAY REQUIRE THE PAYMENTS TO </p><p>HOLD THE SPACE FOR THE EFM WHILE THE EMPLOYEE IS BETWEEN </p><p>ASSIGNMENTS.  THE EMPLOYEE WILL HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>TO MAKE THE PAYMENT AND THEN SEEK REIMBURSEMENT UPON </p><p>ARRIVAL AT THE NEW POST. </p><p> </p><p>EFMS TURNING 21 </p><p>10. ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS (EFMS) REACHING THE AGE OF 21 </p><p>ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO TRAVEL TO POST ON GOVERNMENT </p><p>ORDERS UNLESS THE EFM QUALIFIES FOR EDUCATION TRAVEL WHILE </p><p>AGE 21 OR 22.  IF THE EFM TURNS 21 WHILE OVERSEAS, S/HE </p><p>MAY BE TRAVELED BACK TO THE EMPLOYEES SERVICE SEPARATION </p><p>ADDRESS.  ONCE THE EFM REACHES AGE 23, S/HE IS NOT </p><p>ELIGIBLE FOR EDUCATION TRAVEL EITHER.  EFMS ARE NOT </p><p>ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AFTER THE </p><p>AGE OF 21, WHETHER ON EDUCATION TRAVEL OR NOT.  EMPLOYEES </p><p>SHOULD MAKE SEPARATE MEDICAL INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR </p><p>THESE FAMILY MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>ADDING EFMS/CHANGING HOME LEAVE OR SEPARATION ADDRESS </p><p>11. IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY ANY ITEM ON YOUR RESIDENCY AND </p><p>DEPENDENCY REPORT (HOME LEAVE ADDRESS, SEPARATION ADDRESS, </p><p>DEPENDENTS, ETC.) PLEASE BE SURE TO FILL OUT FORM OF-126 </p><p>IN ITS ENTIRETY AS THE NEW FORM SUPERSEDES EVERYTHING ON </p><p>THE OLD FORM.  FORMS SHOULD BE SENT TO YOUR PERSONNEL </p><p>TECHNICIAN IN HR/CDA/ASD. </p><p> </p><p>MEDICAL CLEARANCES </p><p>12. ALL PERSONS MUST HAVE A CURRENT, VALID MEDICAL </p><p>CLEARANCE FOR POST OF ASSIGNMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>MEDICAL PROGRAM.  EMPLOYEES TRANSFERRING FROM ONE OVERSEAS </p><p>POST TO ANOTHER OVERSEAS POST MUST UPDATE THEIR OWN </p><p>MEDICAL CLEARANCE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR EFMS RECEIVE AN </p><p>UPDATED MEDICAL CLEARANCE PRIOR TO THE END OF THEIR </p><p>CURRENT TOUR OF DUTY OR WHILE ON HOME LEAVE.  EMPLOYEES </p><p>RETURNING TO POST AFTER HOME LEAVE MUST UPDATE THEIR </p><p>MEDICAL CEARANCES AND THE MEDICAL CLEARANCES FOR THEIR </p><p>EFMS PRIOR TO THE END OF HOME LEAVE.  APPOINTMENTS SHOULD </p><p>BE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF HOME LEAVE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE </p><p>TIME IS ALLOWED TO COMPLETE THE CLEARANCE PROCESS.  MED </p><p>MUST APPROVE THE POST OF ASSIGNMENT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES OR </p><p>EFMS HOLDING A LIMITED MEDICAL CLEARANCE PRIOR TO ANY </p><p>DIRECT TRANSFER OR OTHER ASSIGNMENT ROTATION.  TO OBTAIN </p><p>INFORMATION ON HOW TO UPDATE YOUR MEDICAL CLEARANCE, </p><p>CONTACT THE POST MEDICAL OFFICER, REGIONAL MEDICAL OFFICER </p><p>OR MEDICAL CLEARANCES THREE TO FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>END OF THE TOUR OF DUTY OR THE BEGINNING OF HOME LEAVE. </p><p>EMPLOYEES TRANSFERRING FROM THE US TO OVERSEAS MUST </p><p>CONCLUDE MEDICAL CLEARANCES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR EFMS </p><p>TO RECEIVE THEIR POST TRANSFER ORDERS. IT IS THE </p><p>EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBILITY TO INITIATE AND CONCLUDE THE </p><p>MEDICAL CLEARANCE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>LONG TERM TRAINING:  ASSIGNMENT VERSUS DETAIL </p><p>13. EMPLOYEES BEING ASSIGNED TO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND </p><p>LESS THAN 365 DAYS OF TRAINING IN DC EN ROUTE TO ANOTHER </p><p>OVERSEAS POST MAY CHOOSE WHETHER TO BE DETAILED OR BE </p><p>ASSIGNED.  (TRAINING OF LESS THAN SIX MONTHS IS ALWAYS </p><p>HANDLED AS A DETAIL AND PER DIEM PAID TO THE EMPLOYEE </p><p>ONLY; TRAINING OF 12 MONTHS OR MORE IS ALWAYS HANDLED AS </p><p>AN ASSIGNMENT ALLOWING SHIPMENT OF EFFECTS AND NO PER DIEM </p><p>IS PAID.)  IF THE EMPLOYEE ELECTS TO BE DETAILED, THE </p><p>EMPLOYEE (NOT EFMS) RECEIVES PER DIEM FOR THE LENGTH OF </p><p>THE TRAINING.  THE TRAINING MAY NOT BE EXTENDED PAST 365 </p><p>DAYS WITH PER DIEM OR THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE TAXED BY IRS ON </p><p>ALL PER DIEM PAID THROUGHOUT THE TRAINING.

ANY EFM UNDER AGE </p><p>12 GETS 50 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES RATE HOWEVER, </p><p>EMPLOYEES ARE AGAIN CAUTIONED THAT LONG-TERM TRAINING </p><p>GENERALLY DOES NOT INCLUDE TDY AUTHORIZATION FOR FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS (SEE PARA 13 ABOVE). </p><p> </p><p>15.

EMPLOYEES RETURNING FROM AN OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT TO AN </p><p>ASSIGNMENT IN WASHINGTON MAY APPLY FOR THE HOME SERVICE </p><p>TRANSFER ALLOWANCE (HSTA).  THIS IS AVAILABLE IF THE </p><p>EMPLOYEE IS NOT PLANNING TO SEPARATE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. </p><p>THE ALLOWANCE IS INTENDED TO COVER TEMPORARY QUARTERS </p><p>EXPENSES UNTIL PERMANENT HOUSING IS SECURED.  SUBSISTENCE </p><p>EXPENSES CAN BE INCURRED PRIOR TO REPORTING FOR DUTY WHILE </p><p>IN A LEAVE STATUS, BUT ONLY AT THE NEW DUTY STATION. </p><p>HOWEVER A CLAIM CANNOT BE MADE UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY </p><p>REPORTS FOR DUTY.
