Editorials, though preachy and full of </p><p>didactic advice for the new PM, are unusually supportive of </p><p>the appointment, which most writers hope will signal an era </p><p>of good feelings in Kuwaiti governance. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   News Stories: All newspapers lead with news of the </p><p>appointment of former Acting Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al- </p><p>Ahmad as the new Prime Minister of Kuwait. All newspapers </p><p>report that Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad sent a letter to the Crown </p><p>Prince and former Prime Minister, Sheikh Saad, "commending </p><p>his sincere efforts in holding the responsibility of </p><p>chairing successive governments." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that an official source has denied reports </p><p>that the Crown Prince, Sheikh Saad, was stripped of his </p><p>powers as head of the government, stressing that Sheikh Saad </p><p>had voluntarily submitted his resignation as required by the </p><p>constitution, which calls for the resignation of the </p><p>government immediately following parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that MPs, academicians and political </p><p>figures welcome the appointment of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad to </p><p>form the new government, and commend the separation of the </p><p>positions of Crown Prince and Prime Minister. Al-Anba </p><p>newspaper reported that Shia\'a scholars in Kuwait have also </p><p>welcomed Sheikh Sabah\'s appointment. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that Islamist Salafi Islamic Coalition </p><p>chairman Khalid Sultan Al-Issa stated that the separation of </p><p>the positions reflects the "beginning of a new era," and </p><p>that the composition of the new cabinet will determine the </p><p>level of cooperation between the government and the National </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report a statement by the Secretary General </p><p>of the Islamic Constitutional Movement, Issa Al-Shaheen that </p><p>the decision is a big step towards political reform in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seeyasah reports that former MP Adnan Abdelsamad stated </p><p>that the National Assembly is now capable of holding the </p><p>Prime Minister accountable for his mistakes, in contrast to </p><p>when the Crown Prince held the position. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad is expected </p><p>to announce the new Council of Ministers (cabinet) on July </p><p>15. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports on its front page that Islamist MP Waleed </p><p>Al-Tabtabaei warns against the appointment of "Westernized" </p><p>ministers in the new government. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The New Government and Kuwait\'s Dues" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Qabas, Waleed Al-Nesef, </p><p>opined (7/14): "Kuwait stands at a historic moment that </p><p>requires the political leadership to guide the country </p><p>towards the future. [The new Prime Minister] has to appoint </p><p>cabinet members who respect and defend laws, and are capable </p><p>of resisting the extortion of MPs. Kuwait deserves a </p><p>government that believes in the principles of participation. </p><p>therefore, the number of royal family members in the new </p><p>cabinet should be limited. Kuwait deserves a government that </p><p>is politically balanced, not controlled or led by one </p><p>current or power. We want a courageous government that is </p><p>capable of making incisive decisions and is able to </p><p>implement these decisions. This is a new opportunity for </p><p>Kuwait to seriously solve its problems and confront the </p><p>internal and the regional problems facing the country." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "May God Help you" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Watan, Mohammad Al-Jassim </p><p>writes (7/14): "We have to look toward the future now after </p><p>the appointment of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad as the Prime </p><p>Minister. Our efforts must be united to reorganize our </p><p>internal affairs. The duties thrown on Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad </p><p>are enormous. One of the most important issues that the </p><p>government must deal with is the reformation of the </p><p>relationship between the government and the National </p><p>Assembly, which was troubled over the past years. Kuwait </p><p>also needs to reconstruct its political and economical </p><p>systems in light of regional and international events. We </p><p>extend our congratulations to Sheikh Sabah and at the same </p><p>time we tell him, `May God help you.\'" </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Reign" </p><p>Editor-in-chief of independent Al-Rai Al-Aam, Jassim Boodai </p><p>writes (7/14): "Sheikh Saad has been serving Kuwait without </p><p>rest since the Sixties. He engaged in constructive dialogue </p><p>in making his decisions. He stood beside the Amir on many </p><p>occasions, and helped him in running the country and </p><p>rebuilding Kuwait after the invasion. He ignored his </p><p>doctor\'s advice to relax and ended up paying a dear price </p><p>for his continued efforts. The assignment of Sheikh Sabah Al- </p><p>Ahmad as Prime Minister is. an honor to Sheikh Saad by </p><p>reducing the load of his duties." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "More Important than the Appointment" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (7/14): </p><p>"I strongly believe that Kuwait is facing a serious </p><p>political challenge and its direction depends on what the </p><p>new Prime Minister aims to achieve. and the team who will </p><p>assist him in his mission. Moreover, from the names I have </p><p>read so far as possible Cabinet members, it appears that the </p><p>next Cabinet will not be in touch with the requirements of </p><p>the twentieth century. I believe that the government will </p><p>include members of the religious parties, while liberals and </p><p>businessmen will be excluded. This is a preliminary </p><p>indication that Kuwait has not comprehended what it needs to </p><p>face the future, or the changes in the region planned by the </p><p>US." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "One Step in a One Thousand Mile Trip" </p><p>Liberal lawyer Hassan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(7/14):  "The appointment of Sheikh Sabah as Prime Minister </p><p>is an important step in a one thousand mile trip. Sheikh </p><p>Sabah has before him the difficult task of implementing </p><p>reforms, and is not an exaggeration to say that the new </p><p>National Assembly will be an obstacle in the road reform of </p><p>many issues. These are just small challenges compared to </p><p>what is happening in the region." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "We Welcome, Cautiously" </p><p>Abdelataif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas (7/14): </p><p>"I have mentioned on many occasions that we do not want a </p><p>change in persons only [in the cabinet], but rather new and </p><p>open policies. We need to be politically, socially and </p><p>economically open to others. Our welcoming of Sheikh Sabah </p><p>as Prime Minister depends on whether if he is capable of </p><p>starting a new era or not." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
