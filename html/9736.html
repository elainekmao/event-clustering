<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001414 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, PGOV, PREL, KMDR, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKLY NEPAL MEDIA REPORT: JULY 22 - 28, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-  STATE FOR NP, AC, PM </p><p>-  STATE FOR IN/R/MR </p><p>-  STATE FOR SA/INS, PM/CBM, PM/PRO </p><p>-  STATE FOR SA/PPD </p><p> </p><p> 1. PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p> -- Minister denies government agreed to restrict army: </p><p> Finance Minister Dr. Parakeet Chandler Lorain said </p><p> (7/27) the previous talk team of the government had not </p><p> committed to restrict the army within five kilometers </p><p> of the barracks and that the best thing was to sit down </p><p> for talks rather than communicating through letters. </p><p> (centrist "Kantipur," V/D, 7/28) </p><p> </p><p> -- Maoists send response letter to government: The </p><p> Maoists have sent a response letter to the government </p><p> with five conditions and a five-day ultimatum.  The </p><p> conditions include the compliance by the army with all </p><p>agreed-upon decisions so far.  The so-called five-year </p><p>antiterrorism treaty with the U.S. should be annulled </p><p>and all the U.S. military advisors and experts should </p><p>be expelled from the county.  The political agenda </p><p>proposed by the former government should be publicized. </p><p>(independent "Nepal Samacharpatra," V/D, 7/28) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government proposes third round talks by mid-August: </p><p>The government dispatched (7/25) a 14-point letter to </p><p>the Maoists with a proposal to hold the third round of </p><p>formal talks by mid-August. (government media, 7/26) </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. is here for business, nothing else: U.S. </p><p>Embassy spokesperson: Amid allegations of excessive </p><p>interest and intervention in the internal matters of </p><p>the country, the United States has said she wants peace </p><p>in Nepal so that the nation can attract more U.S. </p><p>investment.  "All we have been saying is that we want </p><p>peace so that we can urge American businesses to invest </p><p>in Nepal," director of American Center, Constance </p><p>Colding Jones told "The Himalayan Times."  She said </p><p>America wants the Maoists to behave "like a regular </p><p>political party" and stop indulging in killings, </p><p>kidnappings, extortions and threats.  "Our only concern </p><p>is that we do not want to have yet another hotspot in </p><p>this area," said Jones.  "We also have to protect our </p><p>own interests here in Nepal," she said referring to the </p><p>investment of over US$ 700 million through the USAID </p><p>over the past 50 years.  Jones dismissed the Maoists\' </p><p>allegation that the U.S. is intervening too much in </p><p>Nepal, saying the joint military exercises by the </p><p>armies of the two countries have nothing to do with the </p><p>rise of Maoists\' rebellion and is a part of the </p><p>"regular trainings that have been going on for over 10 </p><p>years". (pro-India "Himalayan Times," E/D, 7/27) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government establishes "contacts" with Maoists: </p><p>Amidst apprehensions that the Maoists may call off the </p><p>six-month long truce and resort to violence again, the </p><p>government today made "informal" contacts with them. </p><p>"We have had an informal contact with them," a </p><p>government source told "The Kathmandu Post."  "We have </p><p>received a positive message from the Maoists that they </p><p>will respond to our last week\'s letter within two to </p><p>three days."  (Major newspapers, 7/22) </p><p> </p><p>-- Five democracies urge Maoists to end "extortions": </p><p>The Industrial Security Group (ISG), a consortium of </p><p>five major democracies including USA, UK, France, </p><p>Germany and India, has asked the Maoists to give up </p><p>"criminal extortions" and sincerely pursue the peace </p><p>process.  It was on the statement issued here today </p><p>(7/21) by the British Embassy, on behalf of the ISG. </p><p>(centrist "Kathmandu Post," E/D, and "The Himalayan </p><p>Times," 7/22) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government must express its regrets: Maoists: The </p><p>Maoists informed that they would open both the contact </p><p>off </p><p>ice and the office of its student wing, provided the </p><p>government regretted the arrest of Bharat Dhungana, </p><p>secretary at the Maoists contact office.  The general </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>secretary of the Maoists\' student wing said that the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Maoists would immediately open their office and they </p><p>would even reply to the letter sent by the government </p><p>if the latter "repented" in public.  ("Kantipur," 7/23) </p><p> </p><p>-- Government assures full security to Maoists: Urging </p><p>Maoists to reopen the Kathmandu contact office, </p><p>Information Minister and talks-convener Kamal Thapa </p><p>said Tuesday government will provide full security to </p><p>Maoist negotiators and is committed to peace talks. </p><p>(Major Newspapers, 7/23) </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoists send "tough" letter to govt.: The Maoists, </p><p>in their letter, have demanded immediate implementation </p><p>of the decisions reached during the second round of </p><p>peace talks.  They have stated, "if the government does </p><p>not do so, we will suppose the government has </p><p>unilaterally broken the ceasefire and left the peace </p><p>process."  In particular, the letter demanded to limit </p><p>army within five kilometers periphery of the barrack. </p><p>This was one of the agreements reached between the </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand government and the Maoists.  On </p><p>the King\'s role, the letter said the talks are getting </p><p>momentum due to the King, who is "playing foul from </p><p>behind the curtains".  "The King should, either get </p><p>involved in the peace talks directly, or stop playing </p><p>foul by granting formal authority to the government to </p><p>hold talks," said the letter. (Major newspapers, 7/24) </p><p> </p><p>2. MAOIST ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. refutes Maoists\' allegations: The U.S. embassy </p><p>has refuted recent allegations made by the Maoists that </p><p>there were linkages between the Royal Nepal Army and </p><p>the U.S. Army.  "There is no existence of American </p><p>military personnel in Nepal.  Only two army liaison </p><p>officers are in the American embassy here," said </p><p>Constance Jones, the director of the American Center, </p><p>Kathmandu.  Jones stressed on talks to find a peaceful </p><p>solution of the present problem.  She reiterated that </p><p>there would be no change in American policy if the </p><p>Maoists continue with their extortion, murders and </p><p>kidnappings. (government-owned "Rising Nepal," E/D, </p><p>7/26) </p><p> </p><p>-- Home Ministry, Maoists deny attacks: In two separate </p><p>statements, Home Ministry and Maoists have denied </p><p>reports of attacks on Sugauli Customs Police Post. </p><p>Various published reports said Monday armed-Maoists </p><p>attacked the police post looting half a dozen weapons. </p><p>(Media reports, 7/22) </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoist cadres want revival of peace process: Hardly </p><p>a day had expired after the Maoists closed down their </p><p>contact office in Kathmandu and announced that its </p><p>leaders were going underground due to security </p><p>concerns, many rank and file Maoist cadres held corner </p><p>meetings in various districts arguing for the need to </p><p>continue the peace process.  ("The Kathmandu Post," </p><p>7/22) </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoists loot solar panels: A large group of armed </p><p>Maoists looted two solar panels connected to the </p><p>repeater tower of the Nepal Telecommunication </p><p>Corporation (NTC) in Kapilvastu district this morning, </p><p>confirmed a guard stationed at the tower.  ("Kantipur," </p><p>7/24) </p><p>3.  NEPAL-U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-- Garment bill gets U.S. green signal: Following the </p><p>Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya\'s week-long visit </p><p>to Washington, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein has agreed </p><p>to move ahead with the bill favoring Nepali garments in </p><p>the U.S. market.  However, her spokesman, Scott Gerber, </p><p>stressed that the senator will stand firm on moving </p><p>ahead with the bill only on the condition that </p><p>incidents like the May deportation "don\'t happen </p><p>again."  Nepalese-made garments are currently subjected </p><p>to an average tariff rate of 18 percent in the U.S., </p><p>which absorbs up to 80 per cent of the garments </p><p>manufactured in Nepal.  The enactment of the bill would </p><p>pave the way for duty and quota free access for a two- </p><p>year period. (Compiled from major dailies, 7/27) </p><p> </p><p>-- Nepali team requests U.S. to pass bill on garments: </p><p> </p><p>A Nepali delegation led by Madhu Raman Acharya, </p><p>secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met E. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ashley Wills, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative and </p><p>Cecilia Leahy Kleln, Director, WTO Accession and </p><p>requested them to pass the bill on Nepali garments at </p><p>the U.S. Senate soon.  The bill was withdrawn from the </p><p>Senate last month on the grounds of Nepal\'s deportation </p><p>of 18 Tibetans to China.  ("The Kathmandu Post" & "The </p><p>Himalayan Times," 7/24) </p><p>4.  BHUTANESE REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>-- India disagrees U.S.\'s assertion: India has </p><p>disagreed the U.S.\'s remarks that India\'s role was </p><p>compulsory for the resolution of the Bhutanese refugee </p><p>crisis.  Indian Embassy First Secretary Sanjay Verma </p><p>said "bi-lateral talks is the appropriate </p><p>medium"..."since the affairs is between the two countries </p><p>[Nepal and Bhutan].  (centrist "Rajdhani," V/D, 7/27) </p><p> </p><p>-- Bhutan in "no mood" to take back refugees: Hiram A. </p><p>Ruiz, the Director of Communications of the U.S. </p><p>Committee for Refugees (USCR) pointed out that in light </p><p>of the "obstinate position" of the Druk government on </p><p>the issue of taking back the refugees, the </p><p>international community had the responsibility to </p><p>resettle the refugees in the third world countries. </p><p>Speaking to "The Kathmandu Post" after his three-day </p><p>visit to the four refugee camps in eastern Nepal, Ruiz </p><p>said, "Given the obstinate position of the Bhutanese </p><p>government, the repatriation of the refugees at this </p><p>point seems impossible."  He added that it was highly </p><p>likely that Bhutan would make it impossible for the </p><p>refugees to return to their homeland. ("The Kathmandu </p><p>Post," 7/27) </p><p> </p><p>-- Editorial on USCR Director\'s remarks: The USCR </p><p>Director\'s remarks, in fact, reinforced the views held </p><p>by many that Bhutan is not playing a fair game.  The </p><p>Khudunabari verification showed that the majority of </p><p>the refugees (about 76 percent) are genuine Bhutanese </p><p>but Bhutan has found one reason or another to refuse </p><p>then their right to return home.  Indeed, over 70 </p><p>percent of the verified refugees are Bhutanese who </p><p>sought refuge "voluntarily".  The USCR Director\'s plea </p><p>to involve India in repatriating the refugees to their </p><p>homeland needs to be taken seriously by New Delhi.  In </p><p>fact, unless the parties involved along with countries </p><p>and agencies concerned such as UNHCR are able to reach </p><p>an agreement satisfactory to the refugees, the </p><p>situation is bound to become murkier. (Editorial in the </p><p>"Kathmandu Post," 7/28) </p><p> </p><p>-- Druk regime on "ethnic cleansing" drive?: At a time </p><p>when the Bhutanese refugee issue has raked up an </p><p>international storm, a new controversy has come to the </p><p>fore with the Druk government issuing an order to </p><p>demolish all the Nepali style houses in Southern Bhutan </p><p>and replace them with Buddhist style houses. </p><p>("Kantipur," 7/27) </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. government to be briefed on Bhutanese refugees: </p><p>Two senior officials of U.S. Refugee Committee will </p><p>soon visit Bhutanese refugee camps and will brief the </p><p>U.S. government on the real situation of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees. ("Kantipur," 7/22) </p><p>-- Refugee categorization: A Nepali, Bhutani joint </p><p>verification team is expected to complete its work on </p><p>appeals of a controversial categorization of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees for repatriation by July 31, Foreign Ministry </p><p>Spokesman Dr. Madan Bhattarai said.  (centrist </p><p>"Annapurna Post," V/D, 7/24) </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. member visits camp: Senior member of the U.S. </p><p>Refugee Committee Hiram Ruij visited the Bhutanese </p><p>refugee camps.  Sources claimed the U.S. visitor had a </p><p>meeting with donor agencies involved in the upkeep of </p><p>refugees.  ("Kantipur," 724) </p><p> </p><p>5.  OTHERS </p><p> </p><p>-- Din of protests against India\'s "unilateral act": </p><p>Over 100 people, representing various social and </p><p>student organizations, staged protest in the capital </p><p>today condemning India\'s unilateral construction of </p><p>Mahalisagar Bund and encroachment of Nepali land on the </p><p>international border.
