<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 004258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/OHI </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 134/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/10/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KNAR, PHUM, KNAR, VT.PREL, VT. </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ARCHIVES Q "THE REAL STORY" </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04258  01 OF 02  131205Z </p><p>REF: STATE 137397 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM GEORGE FROWICK, REASON E.O. 12958 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  A/DCM AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT MET WITH JESUIT </p><p>FATHER PETER GUMPEL AUGUST 10 AT HIS OFFICES IN THE JESUIT </p><p>CURIA TO DISCUSS THE TECHNICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN OPENING </p><p>THE VATICAN ARCHIVES.  (NOTE: THIS WAS A PREVIOUSLY ARRANGED </p><p>MEETING, I.E. BEFORE WE RECEIVED REFTEL. WE NEVERTHELESS </p><p>DELIVERED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME SET OF POINTS, FOCUSING ON </p><p>THE USG\'S INTEREST IN PROMOTING A POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE </p><p>DIALOGUE, AND QUICKLY, AS THE HOLOCAUST GENERATION IS </p><p>PASSING. END NOTE.)    GUMPEL IMMEDIATELY ADVISED THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE OF ACCESS TO THE VATICAN ARCHIVES RELATED TO THE WORLD </p><p>WAR II ERA WAS SIMPLY AN INTERNAL MATTER OF PROCEDURE AND </p><p>NOT A POLITICAL ONE. ALTHOUGH LATER HE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD </p><p>BEEN TURNED INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE THROUGH A DISTORTION OF </p><p>FACTS RELATED TO THE WORKINGS OF A JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION </p><p>STUDYING PIUS XII\'S ROLE DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. </p><p>GUMPEL PROFFERED COPIES OF HIS STATEMENT, WRITTEN WITH </p><p>AUTHORIZATION FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS WITHIN THE VATICAN </p><p>HIERARCHY, COUNTERING "FALSE" ASSERTIONS BY UNNAMED MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE COMMISSION, AS WELL AS A STATEMENT PREPARED BY </p><p>CARDINAL WILLIAM KEELER OF BALTIMORE, THE U.S. BISHOPS </p><p>DELEGATE FOR CATHOLIC-JEWISH AFFAIRS, WHO DID NAME NAMES. </p><p>HE ASSURED US THAT HE WAS A JUDGE FOR MATERIAL USED IN THE </p><p>PROCESS TO DECLARE PIUS XII A SAINT AND NOT THE PROMOTER OF </p><p>THE CAUSE FOR SAINTHOOD. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE "TECHNICAL" PROCESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04258  01 OF 02  131205Z </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  WHEN PRESSED, GUMPEL, WITH SCHOLARLY PRECISION, </p><p>EXPLAINED THE TECHNICAL PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS TO THE VATICAN </p><p>ARCHIVES.  THE MOST RECENT MATERIAL RELEASED FOR SCHOLARLY </p><p>SCRUTINY GOES BACK FIVE PONTIFICATES.  MATERIAL RELATED TO </p><p>THE REIGN OF BENEDICT XV (1914-1922) HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AND </p><p>CATALOGUED AND IS AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS.  CLASSIFICATION </p><p>AND CATALOGUING OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PONTIFICATE OF </p><p>PIUS XI (1922-1939) WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2009 AT THE LATEST. </p><p>GUMPEL SAID HE HOPES FOR AN EARLIER COMPLETION DATE. (NOTE. </p><p>THE PIUS XI DOCUMENTS WILL CONTAIN MATERIAL RELATED TO PIUS </p><p>XII WHEN, AS CARDINAL EUGENIO PACELLI, HE WAS PIUS XI\'S </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE Q PM EQUIVALENT - FROM 1930 UNTIL 1939. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>END NOTE). WORK TO CLASSIFY AND CATALOGUE MATERIAL RELATED </p><p>TO POPE PIUS XII (1939-1958) WOULD NORMALLY COMMENCE IN </p><p>2009. GUMPEL POINTED OUT THAT FOUR JESUITS HAD BEEN GIVEN </p><p>ACCESS TO THE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS AND HAD SPENT </p><p>17 YEARS (1964-1981) SORTING OUT ALL/ALL THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MATERIAL RELATING TO PIUS XII\'S ACTIVITY DURING THE SECOND </p><p>WORLD WAR. THESE WERE THE PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE 12 VOLUMES </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE COMMISSION.  (COMMENT: IT IS </p><p>POST\'S UNDERSTANDING THAT IT CURRENTLY IS LOGISTICALLY </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN UP THE VATICAN ARCHIVES RELATED TO PIUS </p><p>XII\'S ACTIVITIES DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. GUMPEL SAID IT </p><p>CONSISTS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED BOXES (THROUGH WHICH THE JESUITS </p><p>WENT PAPER-BY-PAPER EXTRACTING ALL DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS FOR </p><p>REVIEW) AND MILLIONS OF SHEETS OF PAPER.  MANY OF THESE ARE </p><p>PASTORAL DOCUMENTS (LETTERS TO PRIESTS, ETC) THAT HAVE </p><p>NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HOLOCAUST, BUT WHICH COULD PROVE </p><p>EMBARRASSING TO LIVING PEOPLE.  IT TOOK FOUR HIGHLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04258  01 OF 02  131205Z </p><p>MOTIVATED, INTELLIGENT, MULTILINGUAL JESUITS 17 YEARS TO </p><p>SORT THROUGH AND PUBLISH THE MATERIAL. END COMMENT.)  THE </p><p>VATICAN INSISTS THE OTHER DOCUMENTS WILL BE OPEN TO SCRUTINY </p><p>ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND CATALOGUED AND NOT </p><p>BEFORE.  TWO ARCHIVISTS STAFF THE VATICAN ARCHIVE.  GUMPEL </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS INADEQUATE AND THAT HE HAS REQUESTED </p><p>AN INCREASE IN PERSONNEL PRECISELY TO SPEED US THE PROCESS. </p><p>GUMPEL INFORMED US THAT THIS ARCHIVAL PROCEDURE HAD BEEN </p><p>CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO THE SCHOLARS ON THE COMMISSION OVER THE </p><p>COURSE OF MANY CONVERSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>ACRIMONY FROM THE COMMISSION\'S WORK </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  GUMPEL RECOUNTED AN OCTOBER 2000 MEETING HE HAD </p><p>BEEN ASKED TO ATTEND WITH MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH-VATICAN </p><p>COMMISSION STUDYING PIUS XII\'S ROLE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. </p><p>THE MEETING WAS TAPE-RECORDED WITH THE CONSENT OF ALL THOSE </p><p>PRESENT. GUMPEL ASSERTED TO US THAT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION HAD BEEN WORKING IN AN UNSCHOLARLY WAY AND THAT </p><p>THEIR METHODOLOGY HAD BEEN FLAWED.  NONE OF THE COMMISSION </p><p>MEMBERS HAD READ ALL THE PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS, AND MOST WERE </p><p>NOT ABLE TO READ THE DOCUMENTS IN THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN AND </p><p>HAD TO RELY ON TRANSLATED SUMMARIES. GUMPEL NOTED THAT FROM </p><p>A SCHOLARLY PERSPECTIVE, THIS SITUATION WAS "LESS THAN </p><p>IDEAL."  THE COMMISSION\'S REPORT, WHICH CONSISTED OF 46 </p><p>COMPLEX QUESTIONS, GUMPEL HAD PREPARED TO ANSWER.  HE WORKED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        VATICA  04258  01 OF 02  131205Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0646 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04258  02 OF 02  131206Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NSAE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-00  DSCC-00  LBA-00   PRM-01   DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------115973  131213Z /38 </p><p>R 131146Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 004258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/OHI </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 134/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/10/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KNAR, VT. </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ARCHIVES Q "THE REAL STORY" </p><p> </p><p>UP A SERIES OF HISTORICAL DOSSIERS, INCLUDING PRIMARY </p><p>DOCUMENTS. YET HE SAID HE WAS SUSPICIOUS THAT THE COMMISSION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04258  02 OF 02  131206Z </p><p>HAD NO INTENT TO THOROUGHLY EXPLORE THE QUESTIONS SINCE THEY </p><p>ONLY ALLOCATED THREE HOURS TO THEIR ENCOUNTER.  MOREOVER, </p><p>AFTER REVIEWING DOSSIERS ON ONLY 12 QUESTIONS, SOME OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION MEMBERS LAUNCHED INTO POLEMICAL ATTACKS ON THE </p><p>HOLY SEE FOR ITS ALLEGED LACK OF COOPERATION.  SOME </p><p>COMMISSION MEMBERS LATER MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT A LACK </p><p>OF SUCH ON HIS PART. GUMPEL LAMENTED THE AGGRESSIVE POSITION </p><p>TAKEN TOWARDS HIM PERSONALLY BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION AND THE LACK OF PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC COHESION IN </p><p>THE GROUP OF HISTORIANS AS A WHOLE.  HE HAS DEPOSITED THE </p><p>TAPES OF THE MEETING WITH THE VATICAN.  HIGH LEVEL VATICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE LISTENED TO THE RECORDINGS AND EXPRESSED </p><p>REGRET AT THE UNSCHOLARLY METHODOLOGY OF SOME OF THE JEWISH </p><p>MEMBERS. THOSE SAME VATICAN OFFICIALS, HE SAID, EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR FR. GUMPEL\'S ACUTE KNOWLEDGE OF THE </p><p>SITUATION AND HIS SCIENTIFIC PROFESSIONALISM.  GUMPEL MADE </p><p>IT CLEAR TO A/DCM THAT EVEN POPE JOHN PAUL II IS AWARE OF </p><p>THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>I AM A GERMAN, NOT A NAZI </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  GUMPEL WAS PERSONALLY PAINED BY SOME OF THE AD </p><p>HOMINUM COMMENTARY DIRECTED AT HIM BY JEWISH MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION AND OTHER JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS.  HE STRESSED TO </p><p>A/DCM THAT HE HAS REFRAINED FROM CHARACTERIZING THE WORK OF </p><p>CERTAIN COMMISSION MEMBERS "UNTIL NOW" AS A PROFESSIONAL </p><p>COURTESY AND OUT OF RESPECT.  HOWEVER, HE WARNED THAT IF </p><p>ATTACKS AND FALSEHOODS CONTINUED, HE WOULD RELEASE THE TAPES </p><p>OF THE MEETINGS. (NOTE: GUMPEL INSINUATED THAT THE RELEASE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04258  02 OF 02  131206Z </p><p>TO THE TAPES WOULD PROVE TO BE EMBARRASSING FOR SOME OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION MEMBERS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE COMMISSION ITSELF </p><p>WAS "IN CRISIS" BECAUSE OF CERTAIN MEMBERS\' UNPROFESSIONAL </p><p>BEHAVIOR.  END NOTE).  GUMPEL ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>REFERENCES IN THE MEDIA AND IN OTHER COMMENTS TO HIM AS THE </p><p>"GERMAN JESUIT."   GUMPEL TOLD A/DCM THAT HIS FAMILY HAD </p><p>BEEN VICTIMS OF NAZI PERSECUTION AND SEVERAL HAD BEEN KILLED </p><p>BY THE NAZIS.  HE HIMSELF HAD TO FLEE NAZI GERMANY AS A </p><p>REFUGEE, FIRST TO FRANCE AND THEN LATER TO HOLLAND.  HE </p><p>RECALLED THAT AT ONE POINT A REPORTER HAD PLANNED TO PRINT </p><p>AN ASSERTION THAT GUMPEL WAS A NAZI HIMSELF -- SOMETHING </p><p>GUMPEL SAID WAS LIBELOUS, AND WHICH HE WAS MORE THAN WILLING </p><p>TO GO TO COURT TO FIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  GUMPEL SAID HE WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN THE JEWISH- </p><p>VATICAN COMMISSION DECIDED TO SUSPEND ITS WORK. HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT SOME OF ITS MEMBERS HAD AGENDAS THAT WENT BEYOND THE </p><p>SCOPE OF THE COMMISSION\'S MANDATE (TO STUDY THE TWELVE </p><p>VOLUMES).   OBJECTIONS ABOUT A LACK OF ACCESS TO THE VATICAN </p><p>ARCHIVES OR ABOUT THE VATICAN HAVING SOMETHING TO HIDE ARE, </p><p>IN GUMPEL\'S OPINION, A SMOKE SCREEN FOR POLITICAL AGENDAS </p><p>WHICH HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THE SERIOUS HISTORICAL STUDY </p><p>THAT IS HIS LIFE.  HE CLOSED BY SAYING THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>WANTS TO LET PASS A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE REOPENING THIS </p><p>DISCUSSION.  HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN AND HE HIMSELF WERE </p><p>MORE THAN WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY ANOMALIES OR QUESTIONS </p><p>RELATING TO THE 12-VOLUME HISTORY ALREADY PUBLISHED.  THEY </p><p>JUST DIDN\'T THINK THAT THE JUST-DISBANDED COMMISSION </p><p>CONSISTED OF THE RIGHT MIX OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04258  02 OF 02  131206Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA04258 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
