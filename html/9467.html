(U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The World Food Program, Kellogg, Brown and Root, and </p><p>Delta Petroleum advise that food and fuel supplies </p><p>continue to flow across the Habur border crossing into </p><p>Iraq.  Noting good cooperation with the GOT, WFP reports </p><p>that Turkey is still the leading source of food </p><p>procurements and still an important transit corridor for </p><p>shipments to Iraq.  However, following the July 4 </p><p>incident in Iraq, the MFA has instituted a diplomatic </p><p>note requirement for U.S. citizens seeking entry into </p><p>Iraq from Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>World Food Program </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mission Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO) and </p><p>Environmental Specialist called on Taieb Essayem, the </p><p>World Food Program\'s Emergency Coordinator in Ankara, on </p><p>July 16 to discuss WFP shipments to Iraq.  Essayem told </p><p>us that, through July 3, WFP has delivered 1.2 million </p><p>tons of food to Iraq through neighboring countries.  Of </p><p>this, 450,000 tons have been sent through Turkey, which </p><p>remains the largest aid corridor in tonnage terms. </p><p>Essayem stated that food transport is slowing down now </p><p>that WFP is procuring food in Iraq.  Other aid corridors </p><p>are increasing in relative importance given that </p><p>northern Iraq\'s warehouses are relatively full.  Turkey </p><p>remains a leading supplier to the organization as well, </p><p>with USD 55.6 million (125,000 tons) of food bought in </p><p>Turkey in 2003.  Spending on transport, milling and </p><p>other expenses brings the total spent in Turkey to USD </p><p>95 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Essayem emphasized that the GOT has been very </p><p>cooperative in this operation, and noted that the WFP </p><p>and the GOT signed an agreement giving WFP diplomatic </p><p>status during the week of July 7.  He reported that the </p><p>Habur crossing is now open 24 hours daily.  However, </p><p>local authorities on the Iraqi side are charging WFP </p><p>fees of USD 5 for each 100 liters of fuel that truckers </p><p>bring with them on their return to Turkey and charges </p><p>WFP a fee of USD 20 per entering truck. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fuel Aid and Trade </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Energy supplies continue to flow to Iraq from </p><p>Turkey.  Delta Petroleum, a Turkish company which has </p><p>entered in an energy barter arrangement with SOMO, the </p><p>Iraqi state oil company, told us on July 15 that it has </p><p>transported 19,668 tons of gasoline and 6,658 tons of </p><p>liquid petroleum gas from Turkey to Iraq.  It has also </p><p>moved 34,996 tons of fuel oil in the opposite direction. </p><p>Kellogg, Brown and Root Operations Manager Kurt Meyer </p><p>told us that KBR has bought 220 million liters of </p><p>benzine and 42,000 metric tons of LPG in Turkey for Iraq </p><p>(valued at USD 90 million) to date.  Meyer confirmed </p><p>that Habur is now open on a 24-hour basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Diplomatic Note Now Required </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MFA advised us on July 16 that it would now </p><p>require a diplomatic note from the Embassy for all U.S. </p><p>citizens crossing into Iraq, including USG contractors </p><p>and private citizens.  KBR advised that they were </p><p>unaware of the change in policy.  A U.S. military </p><p>officer from the Incirlik base was turned back at the </p><p>Habur crossing July 16. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
