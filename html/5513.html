<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR SECRETARY THOMPSON </p><p>DEPT PASS FDA FOR DR. MCCLELLAN </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV - LAWLESS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAID, KIPR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Jordan Requests FDA Assessment Team </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Embassy Amman received a letter from Jordanian </p><p>Health Minister Dr. Walid Ma\'ani to HHS Secretary Tommy </p><p>Thompson requesting assistance in developing Jordan\'s </p><p>capacity to support a research-based pharmaceutical </p><p>industry.  The request follows successful meetings </p><p>between Trade Minister Salah al Bashir and FDA </p><p>representatives during the December 2002 Joint Economic </p><p>Committee meetings in Washington, and represents a </p><p>continuation of Jordan\'s steps over the past several </p><p>years to strengthen IPR protections in the pharmaceutical </p><p>sector.  Text of letter follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text </p><p> </p><p>HE Mr. Tommy G. Thompson </p><p>Secretary </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services </p><p>200 Independence Avenue, SW </p><p>Rm. 615F </p><p>Washington, DC  20201 </p><p> </p><p>Excellency, </p><p> </p><p>In view of the strong friendly relationship between </p><p>Jordan and the US which was recently demonstrated by </p><p>enacting the Jordan-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Jordan </p><p>now has a unique opportunity to significantly boost </p><p>private sector-led economic growth through increased U.S. </p><p>trade and investment.  As only the fourth bilateral FTA </p><p>that the U.S. has entered into internationally, and the </p><p>first with an Arab country, this FTA sends a powerful </p><p>signal to potential investors and traders that Jordan is </p><p>open for business, offering unprecedented access to the </p><p>US market. </p><p> </p><p>Capitalizing on our friendly ties and the recent FTA, I </p><p>would appreciate your kind assistance in supporting a </p><p>comprehensive and integrated program whose objective is </p><p>to develop, assist, and establish a self-sustaining </p><p>pharmaceutical regulatory infrastructure in the areas of </p><p>inspection, bio-equivalence studies and drug application </p><p>reviews.  This program will involve all stakeholders, </p><p>such as the Drug Directorate, Jordanian Ministry of </p><p>Health, academia, and industry.  I would also like to </p><p>explore the possibility of inviting an FDA assessment </p><p>team to Jordan as part of this integrated program, and </p><p>follow up with the possibility of sending some of our </p><p>inspectors to be trained at the FDA. </p><p> </p><p>Our pharmaceutical industry, which is considered the </p><p>second export earner for Jordan, is expected to benefit </p><p>tremendously from such a program, as many Jordanian </p><p>companies are poised to export to new markets including </p><p>Europe and the US. </p><p> </p><p>Thanking you in anticipation and looking forward to </p><p>hearing from you at your earliest convenience. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>/s/ </p><p>Prof. Dr. Walid Ma\'ani </p><p>Minister of Health </p><p> </p><p>Cc/Dr. Mark B. McClellan </p><p>Commissioner </p><p>US Food and Drug Administration </p><p>HE US Ambassador/Jordan </p><p>HE Jordan Ambassador/US </p><p>JAPM </p><p>Drug Directorate </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Comment:  Ma\'ani who assumed office late in </p><p>2002, is a forward-looking new Minister who has ambitious </p><p>objectives for developing Jordan\'s health sector and </p><p>overhauling an archaic health ministry.  At a January 12 </p><p>opening event for a new Bristol Myers Squibb Middle East </p><p>regional office in Amman he announced the government\'s </p><p>intention to move quickly on plans to establish a food </p><p>and drug regulatory agency modeled on the FDA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Jordan leads the region in its protection of </p><p>intellectual property rights pertaining to the </p><p>pharmaceutical industry.  The kingdom has stuck to its </p><p>commitments, despite some short-term pains caused to the </p><p>sector, and is looking now to strengthen those </p><p>commitments in order to become a regional center for the </p><p>research-based pharmaceutical industry.  In addition, </p><p>Jordan\'s domestic industry already has both the capacity </p><p>and the expertise to be a platform for US generics </p><p>companies looking to export to the MENA region, or to be </p><p>a low-cost production base to supply the US market </p><p>itself.  The only thing hindering even stronger growth in </p><p>the sector is the time lag involved in the FDA approval </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Supporting Minister Ma\'ani\'s request will help </p><p>cement the gains made in IPR protection in Jordan to </p><p>date, and will help make Jordan a more attractive </p><p>prospect for foreign investment in the health sector.  It </p><p>will also help the local industry develop contacts with </p><p>US partners for co-production, licensing, and the like </p><p>for exports to both the MENA region and the US.  Embassy </p><p>strongly supports Ma\'ani\'s request, and would be happy to </p><p>help support further follow-up contacts between the </p><p>Health Ministry and FDA officials. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
