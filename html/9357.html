Under headline "Bush visit sees welcome consensus on </p><p>      Zim" the independent weekly "The Zimbabwe </p><p>      Independent" dedicated its July 11 editorial to </p><p>      hailing President Bush\'s trip to Africa, saying: "By </p><p>      reaching out to Africa. . .Bush has indicated that </p><p>      post-Iraq America may be turning a new leaf." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "President George W. Bush leaves Africa this weekend </p><p>      hopefully better informed about the myriad problems </p><p>      the continent faces.  He cannot be accused of </p><p>      lacking enthusiasm.  He has committed his government </p><p>      to billions of U. S. dollars in aid and trade that </p><p>      far exceeds anything the Clinton administration </p><p>      attempted.  And as well as promoting a now-familiar </p><p>      agenda on governance, he listened to what other </p><p>      leaders had to say.  In particular he built on ties </p><p>      already forged at past meetings with South African </p><p>      President Thabo Mbeki.   Of interest to us was of </p><p>      course their talks on Zimbabwe. . .While Mbeki </p><p>      appears to have given Bush the same questionable </p><p>      assurances on Zimbabwe that he has been giving other </p><p>      heads of government. . .there does appear to be an </p><p>      identity of views on the need to make progress in </p><p>      resolving the spiraling crisis here that has </p><p>      consequences for the region and NEPAD. . .But for </p><p>      things to give, Mbeki will have to move beyond the </p><p>      facile argument that `the principal responsibility </p><p>      for the resolution of this problem rests with the </p><p>      people of Zimbabwe.\'  If the people of Zimbabwe lie </p><p>      bound and gagged, how then are they supposed to free </p><p>      themselves?  If Bush missed the opportunity to ask </p><p>      that question. . .he will have missed a gaping hole </p><p>      in Mbeki\'s rhetoric armor. . .We trust Bush is not </p><p>      intent upon ignoring these problems in the interests </p><p>      of diplomacy. . .Bush has faced considerable </p><p>      hostility from civil society during his visit to </p><p>      South Africa.  His record on the environment, </p><p>      including abandonment of the Kyoto consensus, </p><p>      breaches of long-held liberties in the interment of </p><p>      individuals suspected of links to Al-Qaeda, the </p><p>      promotion of security legislation that infringes on </p><p>      basic freedoms and encourages other states to do the </p><p>      same, and the frontal assault on the post-1945 </p><p>      international dispensation which the end of </p><p>      multilateralism portends, have all combined to </p><p>      create the impression of a brash gun slinging regime </p><p>      in Washington that disregards the concerns of </p><p>      friends and foes alike.  But bullheaded diplomacy </p><p>      and confrontation with critics do not. . .provide a </p><p>      basis for sound relations with the international </p><p>      community.  By reaching out to Africa, addressing </p><p>      its concerns and doing some uncustomary listening, </p><p>      Bush has indicated that post-Iraq America may be </p><p>      turning a new leaf; that there is more to U. S. </p><p>      power than twisting arms. . . . " </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
