CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  A/S KELLY CONVOKED IRAQI AMBASSADOR </p><p>AL-MASHAT FOR A MEETING AT 1430 EDT, 8/3/90, PRIMARILY TO </p><p>PUT IRAQ ON NOTICE THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY OF </p><p>AMERICANS.  KELLY ALSO CALLED AGAIN FOR IRAQI WITHDRAWAL </p><p>AND RESTORATION OF LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT. </p><p>AL-MASHAT DENIED THAT IRAQ WAS BUILDING UP TROOPS FOR USE </p><p>AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS HELD BY IRAQ </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  KELLY SAID THE UNITED STATES REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN KUWAIT, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT </p><p>OF REPORTS THAT TROOPS HAD TAKEN INTO CUSTODY A NUMBER OF </p><p>AMERICAN OIL FIELD EMPLOYEES.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT WE WERE </p><p>NOT ACCUSING IRAQI TROOPS OF WRONGDOING, BUT IRAQ MUST DO </p><p>TWO THINGS: INFORM US OF THE WELFARE AND WHEREABOUTS OF </p><p>ALL AMERICANS, AND RELEASE ALL DETAINED AMERICANS AT </p><p>ONCE.  THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AL-MASHAT REPLIED THAT IRAQ WAS VERY CONCERNED FOR THE </p><p>SAFETY OF BOTH AMERICANS AND KUWAITIS.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>IRAQI MFA UNDER SECRETARY HAMDUN HAD ASSURED HIM THERE WAS </p><p>NO POLICY OF ARRESTING AMERICANS, AND THAT IRAQI FORCES </p><p>WERE LOOKING FOR THE AMERICANS REPORTED MISSING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHILE AMERICANS HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED, HE SAID, </p><p>SEVERAL HAD BEEN FOUND "IN HOTELS AND OTHER PLACES."  FOUR </p><p>ARE BEING TRANSPORTED TO BAGHDAD AT THIS TIME.  AL-MASHAT </p><p>NOTED THAT ONE OF THE MEN ON THE LIST OF DETAINED </p><p>AMERICANS PASSED TO THE IRAQI MFA BY CHARGE WILSON HAD </p><p>BEEN FOUND TO BE A BRITISH CITIZEN.  HE ASKED THAT NEWS OF </p><p>THE FOUR AMERICANS EN ROUTE TO BAGHDAD BE CONVEYED TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>IRAQI WITHDRAWAL </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  KELLY INFORMED AL-MASHAT THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>ENTIRELY SUPPORTS THE GCC STATEMENT CALLING FOR IRAQI </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT.  FURTHERMORE, THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>ALONG WITH THE UNSC, CALLS ON IRAQ TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES </p><p>FROM KUWAIT IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AL-MASHAT SAID IT IS IRAQ\'S POLICY TO WITHDRAW WITHIN </p><p>A MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS, AS STATED IN PREVIOUS IRAQI </p><p>STATEMENTS IN WASHINGTON AND BAGHDAD.  HE NOTED THAT ARAB </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY KING HUSSEIN AND OTHERS WERE MAKING </p><p>PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  KELLY STRESSED THAT THE UNITED STATES WANTS </p><p>RESTORATION OF THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF KUWAIT. </p><p>AL-MASHAT SAID HE WOULD PASS THAT WISH TO BAGHDAD. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>IRAQI MILITARY BUILD-UP </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  KELLY INFORMED AL-MASHAT THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED A </p><p>CONTINUING BUILD-UP OF IRAQI ARMED FORCES IN AN AREA OF </p><p>CONCERN TO US.  AL-MASHAT REPLIED THAT HE IS UNAWARE OF </p><p>ANY BUILD-UP, AND ASKED WHERE IT IS TAKING PLACE.  KELLY </p><p>REPEATED THAT THE BUILD-UP IS IN AN AREA OF CONCERN TO </p><p>US.  HE REMINDED AL-MASHAT THAT HE (AL-MASHAT) HAD BEEN </p><p>UNAWARE OF IRAQ\'S INVASION PLANS, SO HE MIGHT BE SIMILARLY </p><p>UNINFORMED OF THE PRESENT BUILD-UP.  AL-MASHAT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT "ENTERING </p><p>KUWAIT."  MR. KELLY CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY REPEATING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES POSITION THAT IRAQI FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW </p><p>FROM KUWAIT AT ONCE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN THE CORRIDOR AFTER THE MEETING  AL-MASHAT RAISED </p><p>KELLY\'S STATEMENT ABOUT AN ONGOING IRAQI MILITARY BUILD-UP </p><p>WITH DAS MACK.  AL-MASHAT STATED THAT IF KELLY HAD MEANT A </p><p>BUILD-UP DIRECTED AT SAUDI ARABIA, HE COULD STATE THAT </p><p>THERE IS "NOT ONE IOTA OF TRUTH" IN THE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
