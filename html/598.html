<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 000190 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPTURN IN FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>ACTIVITY IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) CAIRO 4357, (B) ALEXANDRIA 150 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY/COMMENT:  COMMENT:  ALEXANDRIA AND THE </p><p>DELTA HAVE, SO FAR, TRAILED UPPER EGYPT AND CAIRO IN </p><p>TERMS OF VIOLENT FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY.  WE DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE NORTHERN EGYPT IS IMMUNE TO THIS KIND OF </p><p>ACTIVITY AND ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN RELIGIOSITY </p><p>AND SIGNS THAT VIOLENCE MAY NOT BE FAR OFF.  END </p><p>COMMENT.  FORTY EIGHT PERSONS WERE ARRESTED MARCH 8; </p><p>EIGHT JIHAD MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED MARCH 15 FOR </p><p>BREAKING INTO A MOSQUE IN THE GHARBIA GOVERNORATE </p><p>TOWN OF ZEFTRA AND TRYING TO TAKE IT OVER, AND WE ARE </p><p>HEARING OUR FIRST REPORTS OF EGYPTIANS OBJECTING TO </p><p>AMERICANS GOING ABOUT WITHOUT THEIR HEADS COVERED. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE ALEXANDRIA ARRESTS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA ON </p><p>MARCH 8.  ALTHOUGH SOME WEAPONS WERE FOUND THERE WERE </p><p>NONE OF THE CLASHES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR </p><p>MEASURES ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT.  BY CONTRAST, A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ISLAMIST ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>PRINTED MATERIAL WAS SEIZED. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE CONFLICTING STORIES ABOUT WHO AND WHAT </p><p>THOSE ARRESTED ARE.  ONE POLICE OFFICER TOLD US ALL </p><p>THOSE ARRESTED WERE FROM UPPER EGYPT AND THAT SOME </p><p>WERE INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF THE BRITISH TOURIST </p><p>LAST OCTOBER AND OTHER ATTACKS ON TOURISTS.  OTHER </p><p>POLICE SOURCES INDICATED THAT THOSE ARRESTED WERE </p><p>ACTIVISTS (PLANNERS, ORGANIZERS) AS OPPOSED TO </p><p>TERRORISTS.  THE PRESS REPORTS THAT 11 OF THE 48 </p><p>ARRESTED HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE PRESS CLAIMS THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE </p><p>ARRESTED BELONG TO "HEZBOLLAH", BUT THERE IS </p><p>CONFUSION ON THAT SCORE AS WELL.  ONE POLICE SOURCE </p><p>DENIED THAT HEZBOLLAH WAS PRESENT IN ALEXANDRIA AT </p><p>ALL.  ANOTHER SOURCE SAID THE NAME HEZBOLLAH WAS </p><p>ADOPTED BY A SMALL GROUP OF EXTREMISTS WHO HAD </p><p>BROKEN AWAY FROM THEIR MAIN GROUP BECAUSE OF A </p><p>DISPUTE OVER CONTROL AND HAD CHOSEN WHAT THEY </p><p>THOUGHT WAS A CATCHY NAME. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MOSQUE TAKE OVER </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  EIGHT MEMBERS OF JIHAD WERE ARRESTED FOR </p><p>BREAKING INTO A MOSQUE, USING CHAINS TO ATTACK THOSE </p><p>SAYING PRAYERS AND ATTEMPTING TO TAKE OVER THE </p><p>MOSQUE FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.  THE INCIDENT </p><p>OCCURRED IN THE VILLAGE OF SHOUBRA MALAS IN ZEFTA IN </p><p>THE DELTA GOVERNORATE OF GHARBIA.  THERE WAS A CLASH </p><p>BETWEEN THE INTRUDERS AND THE "CONGREGATION", BEFORE </p><p>INTRUDERS WERE ARRESTED.  THIS INCIDENT CLOSELY </p><p>RESEMBLES ANOTHER ATTEMPTED TAKE OVER OF A MOSQUE IN </p><p>KAFR EL ZAYAT, ALSO IN GHARBIA, IN AUGUST 1992.  THE </p><p>AUGUST INCIDENT WAS REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED BY </p><p>ACTIVISTS FROM UPPER EGYPT ATTEMPTING TO FORM JIHAD </p><p>CELLS IN THE DELTA. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THE PRESS ALSO REPORTS A MARCH 17 INCIDENT IN </p><p>TANTA, THE CAPITAL OF GHARBIA GOVERNORATE.  TWENTY </p><p>EIGHT FUNDAMENTALISTS ARE ACCUSED OF ATTACKING A </p><p>SHRINE AND ATTEMPTING TO DIG UP THE COFFIN OF THE </p><p>SAINT TO WHICH IT IS DEDICATED.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS, REVERENCE OF SAINTS IS AN </p><p>ABERRATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>HEJAB FOR AMERICANS? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  TWO AMERICAN WOMEN RESIDENT IN ALEXANDRIA WERE </p><p>WAVED OUT OF AN ANTIQUE SHOP IN TOWN THIS WEEK </p><p>BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR HEADS COVERED.  AT </p><p>LEAST ONE OF THE WOMEN IS A GRANDMOTHER AND BOTH </p><p>WERE CONSERVATIVELY DRESSED.  BOTH HAVE SHOPPED IN </p><p>THE AREA BEFORE AND NEVER ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM. </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  TO DATE ALEXANDRIA HAS BEEN SPARED THE VIOLENCE </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH INCIDENTS IN UPPER EGYPT AND EVEN </p><p>CAIRO.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, A DEFINITE INCREASE IN </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY AND, FOR SOME LONGTIME </p><p>RESIDENTS, AN ALMOST PALPABLE CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. </p><p>AS NOTED, THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AS TO </p><p>WHO IS DOING WHAT IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA.  GOE </p><p>OFFICIALS JUMP AT ANY CHANCE TO ATTRIBUTE PROBLEMS </p><p>TO FOREIGN INFLUENCES, WHILE ALEXANDRIA OFFICIALS </p><p>JUMP AT ANY CHANCE TO CLAIM THE TROUBLEMAKERS COME </p><p>FROM UPPER EGYPT.  THERE PROBABLY IS SOME EXTERNAL </p><p>INFLUENCE AND THERE MAY BE UPPER EGYPTIANS WHO HAVE </p><p>COME TO ALEXANDRIA TO ESCAPE POLICE ATTENTION AND/OR </p><p>TO ORGANIZE; THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND HERE BEFORE.  BUT, </p><p>EVEN WITHOUT THEM, ECONOMIC DISSATISFACTION AND A </p><p>TREND TOWARD FUNDAMENTALISM HAVE EXISTED FOR SOME </p><p>TIME PRIMARILY AMONG THE POORER ELEMENTS OF </p><p>ALEXANDRIAS POPULATION, EVEN IF THIS HAS NOT YET </p><p>SPURRED THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE SEEN IN UPPER EGYPT </p><p>AND, MOST RECENTLY, IN CAIRO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHELL </p><p></p></div>
