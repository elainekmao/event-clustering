<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/08/06 </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, PGOV, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROVINCIAL EDUCATION: DOING THEIR BEST BUT. . . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT C. PORTER, CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES, A.I.,  REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  PROVINCES BETWEEN HO CHI MINH CITY AND </p><p>HANOI CLEARLY HAVE DEVOTED STAFF AND GOOD INTENTIONS IN </p><p>THEIR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, BUT AN ENDEMIC LACK OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02963  01 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>RESOURCES LEAVES CHILDREN IN OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS </p><p>WITH FEW RESOURCE MATERIALS.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>SEEK TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO FINISH </p><p>GRADE 9 AND HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND ENGLISH </p><p>CLASSES WITHIN A FEW YEARS, BUT MANY LOCALITIES MAY </p><p>MISS THIS TARGET.  THESE EDUCATIONAL CONSTRAINTS WILL </p><p>FURTHER REDUCE VIETNAM\'S ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY </p><p>IN GLOBAL MARKETS IN THE FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  DURING OCTOBER 25-NOVEMBER 2 TRAVELS TO </p><p>PROVINCES ALONG ROUTE ONE BETWEEN HO CHI MINH CITY AND </p><p>HANOI, POL/C AND POL FSN DISCUSSED EDUCATIONAL ISSUES </p><p>WITH PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN, </p><p>EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT CHIEFS, AND SCHOOL PRINCIPALS, </p><p>AND ALSO VISITED A NUMBER OF ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE/HIGH </p><p>(GRADES 6-9) SCHOOLS.  SEPTELS WILL DESCRIBE OTHER </p><p>DISCUSSIONS DURING THIS TRIP BY EMBASSY VEHICLE. </p><p> </p><p>HOW MANY KIDS CAN YOU FIT IN A CLASSROOM? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  THE PHYSICAL REALITIES OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>EDUCATION AT LEAST IN THESE COASTAL PROVINCES OF </p><p>VIETNAM ARE OFTEN DISMAYING FROM AN AMERICAN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, ALBEIT NOT NOTICEABLY INFERIOR TO SIMILAR </p><p>SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA.  CLASSROOMS ARE </p><p>ALMOST INVARIABLY OPEN AIR, DESPITE THE HIGH HEAT AND </p><p>HUMIDITY AS WELL AS SEASONAL DOWNPOURS.  STUDENTS IN </p><p>BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS ARE USUALLY CROWDED </p><p>FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS TO A BENCH AND FORTY TO FIFTY </p><p>STUDENTS PER CLASSROOM.  VIRTUALLY ALL ELEMENTARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02963  01 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>SCHOOLS AND MANY MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOLS MUST DIVIDE THEIR </p><p>STUDENT POPULATIONS INTO MORNING AND AFTERNOON GROUPS </p><p>DUE TO OVERCROWDING.  WHILE STUDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO </p><p>HAVE FOUR OR FIVE HOURS OF CLASSROOM TIME EACH DAY, THE </p><p>MIGRATION TO AND FROM SCHOOL BY FOOT OR BICYCLE IN MID- </p><p>MORNING OR MID-AFTERNOON SUGGEST THAT MANY SCHOOLS ARE </p><p>NOT ABLE TO KEEP TO THIS SCHEDULE.  PLAYGROUND OR </p><p>SPORTS FACILITIES ARE USUALLY SMALL OR NON-EXISTENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  STUDENTS IN MANY SCHOOLS APPEAR TO HAVE FEW </p><p>BOOKS, APPARENTLY RELYING MORE COMMONLY ON LECTURES BY </p><p>THE TEACHERS AND TRADITIONAL BLACKBOARDS.   THE </p><p>LIBRARIES IN MANY SCHOOLS CONSIST ONLY OF A SMALL ROOM </p><p>WITH A HANDFUL OF BOOKS OR PERIODICALS.  (AT MANY </p><p>SCHOOLS, POL/C PRESENTED VARIOUS PAS PUBLICATIONS IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND ENGLISH ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.)  COMPUTER ROOMS AT MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOLS USUALLY </p><p>CONTAINED NO MORE THAN TEN WORKSTATIONS AND A SINGLE </p><p>PRINTER;  FEW HAVE INTERNET ACCESS.  EVEN COMPUTER </p><p>ROOMS WERE USUALLY NOT AIR-CONDITIONED AND APPEARED NOT </p><p>TO BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDENT ACCESS BETWEEN OR AFTER </p><p>CLASSES. </p><p> </p><p>PROVINCIAL REALITIES AND HOPES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO BINH THUAN PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN </p><p>NUYNH TAN THANH, THIS PROVINCE WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE </p><p>UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION BY 1997.  HIS GOAL NOW IS </p><p>TO REACH UNIVERSAL MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION BY 2003 </p><p>OR 2004.  THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HIS PROVINCE FACES IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02963  01 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>THIS EFFORT ARE A LACK OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND RURAL </p><p>POVERTY THAT FORCES PARENTS TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO </p><p>WORK.  WHILE IN PRINCIPLE ALL 103 MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOLS </p><p>ARE SUPPOSED TO OFFER COMPUTER CLASSES TO STUDENTS, NOT </p><p>ALL YET HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR TEACHERS.  ALL 31 SENIOR </p><p>HIGH SCHOOLS (INCLUDING 4 BOARDING SCHOOLS FOR MINORITY </p><p>STUDENTS) PROVIDE SUCH TRAINING, HOWEVER.  DISTANCE </p><p>LEARNING VIA TELEVISION OR INTERNET IS "LIMITED," HE </p><p>NOTED, ALTHOUGH STUDENTS AT THE PROVINCIAL TEACHERS\' </p><p>COLLEGE CAN TAKE SOME UNIVERSITY CLASSES IN PHAN THIET </p><p>CITY.  HE ADDED THAT A PRIVATELY-FUNDED UNIVERSITY IS </p><p>IN THE WORKS, AND HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE ABOUT </p><p>ULTIMATE GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR ITS ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE KHANH HOA PROVINCIAL EDUCATION CHIEF </p><p>NOTED THE NEED TO "STRENGTHEN" ITS SCHOOL SYSTEM AND TO </p><p>"STRUGGLE" TO ACCOMPLISH UNIVERSAL 9TH GRADE EDUCATION; </p><p>ONLY ABOUT 60 PCT OF TEENAGERS AT THAT AGE NOW COMPLETE </p><p>MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL.  HE LAMENTED THE FISCAL LIMITATIONS </p><p>THAT PREVENTED ESTABLISHMENT OF MORE SCHOOLS. </p><p>PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN PHAM VAN CHI CLAIMED THAT FAMILY </p><p>POVERTY RATHER THAN INSUFFICIENT PROVINCIAL BUDGETS WAS </p><p>THE LARGER ISSUE;  EVEN THE MODEST MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>FEES OF 70,000 DONG (USD 5) PER STUDENT PER YEAR WAS </p><p>BEYOND THE RESOURCES OF SOME FAMILIES.  HE ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT THE PROVINCE HAD A TOTAL OF ONLY 60 COMPUTERS FOR </p><p>2000 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT BY </p><p>2003 75 PCT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS </p><p>TO THE INTERNET (ONLY 4 PCT DO NOW, HE SAID).  SIXTH </p><p>GRADE STUDENTS NOW BEGIN ENGLISH; HE EXPRESSED A HOPE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02963  02 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>TO BEGIN TEACHING ENGLISH IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS AT SOME </p><p>POINT IN THE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THERE ARE NO </p><p>SPECIFIC PLANS TO DO SO YET. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  BINH DINH PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN VU HOANG HA </p><p>EXPRESSED A HOPE FOR UNIVERSAL MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>EDUCATION BY 2003 OR 2004 AS WELL AS FOR THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT BY 2003 OF A PRIVATELY FUNDED UNIVERSITY. </p><p>THERE ARE NOW OVER 900 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, ABOUT 50 </p><p>MIDDLE AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS, AND ONE TEACHER\'S </p><p>COLLEGE FOR AN OVERALL STUDENT POPULATION OF ABOUT </p><p>11,000.  SOME PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ALREADY </p><p>EXIST, MOSTLY TEACHING NON-DEGREE COURSES IN COMPUTER, </p><p>ENGLISH, OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING.  TWO APPLICATIONS ARE </p><p>PENDING FOR PRIVATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO COMPLEMENT A </p><p>SINGLE EXISTING PRIVATE SCHOOL.  HIS GOAL IS THAT 95 </p><p>PCT OF STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO FINISH GRADE 9 BY 2005. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT ALL HIGH SCHOOLS ALREADY REQUIRE </p><p>COURSES IN COMPUTERS AND ENGLISH; SOME HAVE INTERNET </p><p>ACCESS.  A FEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ALSO OFFER ENGLISH, </p><p>HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO QUANG NAM PROVINCIAL VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN HO THI THANH LAM, ALL CITIES AND DISTRICTS IN </p><p>THE PROVINCE NOW HAVE MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOLS BUT SOME </p><p>RURAL TOWNSHIPS DO NOT.  EVEN PRIMARY EDUCATION IN THIS </p><p>PROVINCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE FULLY UNIVERSAL BEFORE </p><p>2007, ALTHOUGH ABOUT 80 PCT OF PRIMARY SCHOOL AGE </p><p>CHILDREN NOW ARE ABLE TO ATTEND.  SHE CLAIMED ABOUT 60 </p><p>PCT OF 15-YEAR OLDS FINISH MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL.  SHE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL ANNUAL FEES OF ABOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02963  02 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>90,000 DONG (US 6) POSE A PROBLEM FOR SOME FAMILIES, </p><p>BUT SAID GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES WERE AVAILABLE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR MINORITY STUDENTS.  ENGLISH CLASSES ARE </p><p>MANDATED BEGINNING IN 6TH GRADE, WITH SOME ELEMENTARY </p><p>SCHOOLS ALSO OFFERING COURSES.  COMPUTER TRAINING DOES </p><p>NOT BEGIN UNTIL 10TH GRADE, HOWEVER;  SHE EXPRESSED A </p><p>WISH THAT FUTURE BUDGETS WOULD ENABLE PURCHASE OF MORE </p><p>COMPUTERS.  CLASSES FOR MINORITY STUDENTS ARE ALMOST </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY IN VIETNAMESE, ALTHOUGH SHE SAID THE </p><p>PROVINCE WAS "TRYING TO DO MORE" TO TEACH IN LOCAL </p><p>MINORITY LANGUAGES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) DANANG MUNICIPAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR HUYNH </p><p>VAN HOA SAID THAT THE CITY HAD ACHIEVED UNIVERSAL </p><p>PRIMARY EDUCATION IN 2000 AND HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST </p><p>LEVEL OF MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE NATION, </p><p>WITH ABOUT 80 PCT OF ALL FIFTEEN-YEAR OLDS IN THE CITY </p><p>NOW FINISHING 9TH GRADE.  HE NOTED THAT THEY MIGHT </p><p>NEVER REACH 100 PCT DUE TO THE LACK OF SCHOOLS FOR </p><p>PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED STUDENTS. (SEPTEL </p><p>WILL REPORT ON A PRIVATE FACILITY FOR SUCH STUDENTS RUN </p><p>BY CATHOLIC NUNS.)  MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL MONTHLY FEES OF </p><p>20,000 DONG (USD 1.25) POSE LITTLE PROBLEM FOR MOST </p><p>URBAN RESIDENTS, BUT 5-10 PCT OF MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>STUDENTS NONETHELESS RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIPS.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED A HOPE FOR MORE FOREIGN LANGUAGE CLASSES, S&T </p><p>TRAINING, ASSISTANCE FROM THE USG AND NGOS FOR PRIMARY </p><p>EDUCATION, AND SCHOLARSHIPS TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT ALL MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SHOULD </p><p>HAVE INTERNET ACCESS BY 2005;  HALF OF MIDDLE/HIGH </p><p>SCHOOLS IN DANANG NOW PROVIDE IT.  ALL MIDDLE/HIGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02963  02 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE ENGLISH, AND THE </p><p>GOAL WITHIN 5 YEARS IS TO BEGIN ENGLISH TRAINING IN THE </p><p>3RD OR 4TH GRADE.  HE ADDED THAT DANANG HAS HAD PRIVATE </p><p>SCHOOLS FOR ABOUT A DECADE, NOW INCLUDING THREE HIGH </p><p>SCHOOLS, AND THAT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN "SATISFACTORY." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  QUANG BINH PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN PHAN </p><p>VIET DUNG DESCRIBED HOW THE PROVINCE HAD REACHED </p><p>UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION AS EARLY AS 1993.  AT </p><p>PRESENT, ABOUT 78 PCT OF TEENAGERS FINISH 9TH GRADE; </p><p>THE GOAL IS TO REACH UNIVERSAL MIDDLE/HIGH EDUCATION BY </p><p>2005.  ONLY ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF TEENAGERS FINISH </p><p>SENIOR/HIGH SCHOOL, HOWEVER.   HE ADMITTED A SPECIAL </p><p>NEED TO DO MORE TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>FOR MINORITY STUDENTS;  FOUR BOARDING SCHOOLS NOW EXIST </p><p>FOR STUDENTS FROM THESE REMOTE AREAS.  ENGLISH CLASSES </p><p>ARE NOW ONLY COMPULSORY IN THE PROVINCE\'S 18 SENIOR </p><p>HIGH SCHOOLS;  BY 2003, THE PROVINCE WANTS TO MAKE </p><p>ENGLISH COMPULSORY IN ALL 115 MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOLS AS </p><p>WELL.  THERE ARE NO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AT PRESENT DUE TO </p><p>"LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS," BUT HE CITED SOME "SEMI- </p><p>PRIVATE" SCHOOLS FOR COMPUTER TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO NGHE AN VICE CHAIRMAN HOANG KY </p><p>AND THE PROVINCIAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR, THIS PROVINCE </p><p>HAD REACHED UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION BY 1998 AND </p><p>SEEKS TO UNIVERSALIZE MIDDLE/HIGH EDUCATION BY 2005. </p><p>COMPUTER TRAINING WAS AVAILABLE IN THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>CAPITAL FOR STUDENTS EVEN AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL BUT </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS ONLY AT MOST MIDDLE AND SENIOR HIGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02963  03 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>SCHOOLS.  SOME REMOTE SCHOOLS IN MINORITY AREAS DO NOT </p><p>YET HAVE ELECTRICITY.  ENGLISH IS COMPULSORY ONLY IN </p><p>MIDDLE AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS.  THE PROVINCE, WHICH </p><p>HAS A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATION, HAS BEGUN SOME </p><p>ELEMENTARY CLASSES IN HMONG LANGUAGE BUT HAS "NO </p><p>SPECIFIC PLANS" FOR INTRODUCTION OF OTHER MINORITY </p><p>LANGUAGES.  LESS THAN 20 PCT OF ALL TEACHERS THEMSELVES </p><p>COME FROM MINORITY GROUPS.  EDUCATION IS FREE FOR </p><p>MINORITY STUDENTS EVEN THROUGH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND </p><p>UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  NGHE AN OFFICIALS ALSO NOTED HOW THE </p><p>PROVINCE HAD "STRUGGLED" TO INDUCE HMONG FAMILIES TO </p><p>ALLOW THEIR DAUGHTERS TO STUDY.  IN SOME AREAS, THE </p><p>PROVINCE SET UP SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS, WITH ONLY </p><p>FEMALE TEACHERS.  OFFICIALS AND TEACHERS HAVE ALSO BEEN </p><p>PROMOTING THE CONCEPT THAT HMONG BOYS SHOULD ONLY MARRY </p><p>GIRLS WHO KNOW HOW TO READ.  THERE ARE NO BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOLS FOR MINORITY STUDENTS AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL, </p><p>BUT SOME EXIST FOR MIDDLE AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>STUDENTS WHOSE HOMES ARE MORE THAN TWO HOURS FROM A </p><p>SCHOOL.  THE MAIN CHALLENGES OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE TO REDUCE THE GAP </p><p>BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN STANDARDS, TO POPULARIZE AND </p><p>FUND COMPUTER AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRAINING, AND TO </p><p>PROMOTE POST MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION.  AT PRESENT, </p><p>ONLY ABOUT 1,000 OF THE PROVINCE\'S 7,000 SENIOR/HIGH </p><p>SCHOOL GRADUATES ENTER UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  COMMENT:  VIETNAMESE CULTURE HAS </p><p>TRADITIONALLY VALUED EDUCATION, AND THERE ARE CLEARLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02963  03 OF 03  140145Z </p><p>MANY DEVOTED TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL OFFICIALS IN </p><p>THESE AND OTHER PROVINCES.   NEW SCHOOLS ARE BEING </p><p>BUILT (SOME WITH FUNDING INDIRECTLY FROM USDA AND </p><p>OTHERS BY OTHER INTERNATIONAL DONORS SUCH AS SOUTH </p><p>KOREA) OR RENOVATED.  EDUCATION APPEARS TO REPRESENT A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF LOCAL BUDGETS, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS </p><p>UNCLEAR HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE UNDER </p><p>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION GUIDANCE.  THE STRUGGLE TO </p><p>PROMOTE MORE UNIVERSAL EDUCATION WILL CONTINUE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE NEXT DECADE, BUT MAY NOT BE FULLY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL GIVEN FINANCIAL AND PERSONNEL CONSTRAINTS AS </p><p>WELL AS GEOGRAPHICAL BARRIERS AND LOCAL CULTURAL </p><p>TRADITIONS.  THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT, IN AN ERA OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION AND INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS, TOO FEW </p><p>PROVINCIAL STUDENTS IN VIETNAM ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE </p><p>COMPETENCY EVEN IN ENGLISH OR BASIC INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO ENHANCE VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS.  THIS REALITY IS UNLIKELY TO </p><p>CHANGE DRAMATICALLY EVEN WITHIN A DECADE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  NOTE:  FOLLOWING A RECENT VISIT BY THE </p><p>REGIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE OFFICER FROM AMEMBASSY </p><p>BANGKOK, POST NOW PLANS TO INITIATE SEVERAL SMALL </p><p>PROJECTS WITH UNIVERSITIES IN HANOI AND HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY AIMED AT REFORMING THE STANDARDS USED IN MEASURING </p><p>ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY IN VIETNAM AND IMPROVING </p><p>TRAINING FOR TEACHERS OF ENGLISH AT THE PRIMARY AND </p><p>SECONDARY LEVELS. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02963  03 OF 03  140145Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
