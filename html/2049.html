ABUJA 2113 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2560 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolCouns and </p><p>PolMilOff, called on NSA Aliyu Mohammed on October 8. </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sule Lamido, the Governor of </p><p>Kaduna State, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi, Adobe Obe, an </p><p>advisor to President Obasanjo, and LTC Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor also attended.  This message covers their </p><p>conversation on the Sudan peace process, and Nigeria\'s </p><p>mediation efforts on the DROC and Burundi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED: The NSA conveyed a message passed </p><p>to President Obasanjo from Sudanese Minister al-Din </p><p>requesting the U.S. suspend unilateral sanctions on Sudan. </p><p>Mohammed explained Nigeria\'s plan to host conferences of </p><p>Southern and Northern Sudanese leaders in Abuja next month. </p><p>The NSA made a strong case for U.S.-Nigeria cooperative </p><p>efforts to achieve peace in Sudan.  On Congo, after an </p><p>initial attempt at a meeting with Kabila, Bemba and Onusumba </p><p>failed due to logistical snafus, Nigeria now was working on a </p><p>second meeting.  Finally, the NSA briefly discussed a </p><p>possible peacekeeping mission in Burundi, and told us that an </p><p>ailing Mandela had asked Obasanjo to take over as mediator. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>SUDAN - TOO MANY COOKS? </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The NSA informed Ambassador Jeter that, during a </p><p>recent meeting, the Sudanese Minister of Peace, Dr. Ghazi </p><p>Salah al-Din, had asked President Obasanjo to appeal to </p><p>President Bush to waive U.S. unilateral sanctions against </p><p>Sudan (due for renewal on 4 November, according to the NSA). </p><p>The NSA believed that lifting the sanctions would help the </p><p>peace process.  Mohammed believed Sudan was making an effort </p><p>to be on the right side of the war against terrorism and was </p><p>seeking to engage bilaterally with many countries, including </p><p>the U.S.  FM Lamido agreed, noting that Sudan appeared to be </p><p>under "a new dispensation."  The NSA added that al-Din had </p><p>suggested Special Envoy Senator Danforth travel to Abuja to </p><p>meet with President Obasanjo when Danforth makes his first </p><p>trip to Sudan.  President Obasanjo would welcome a meeting </p><p>with Senator Danforth, either before or after he travels to </p><p>Sudan, the NSA interjected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The NSA outlined Nigeria\'s approach to facilitating </p><p>the peace process.  Nigeria planned to hold two simultaneous </p><p>conferences in Abuja from 12 to 17 November: one to get the </p><p>fractious Southern leaders to a common position; the other </p><p>for the Northern leaders.  Once both groups had achieved a </p><p>workable degree of internal cohesion, the two conferences </p><p>would be brought under one tent.  The goal was to reach a </p><p>cessation of hostilities, and to come to agreement on a </p><p>"united Sudan" that would grant significant autonomy to the </p><p>South through a federation, "like Nigeria\'s."  On matters of </p><p>health, education and development, the component states would </p><p>have significant decision-making powers, but in foreign </p><p>affairs and monetary policy, Khartoum would be paramount, </p><p>Lamido noted.  The Carter Center, the office of the UN </p><p>Secretary General, Libya, and other interested African states </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>would be invited to have observers at the conference, </p><p>particularly Sudan\'s neighbors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked if Sudan were willing to </p><p>discuss self-determination.  Lamido responded that </p><p>self-determination was a "complicated phrase," and that a </p><p>more palatable term for Khartoum was "autonomy."  Both Lamido </p><p>and Mohammed contended that some neighboring states had </p><p>self-interested agendas which they were pushing to the </p><p>detriment of peace in Sudan.  Some states were complicating </p><p>matters by using phrases like self-determination that only </p><p>stoked the passions of hard-liners on both sides of the </p><p>North-South divide.  In this regard, it was important to keep </p><p>the headstrong Garang from acting like a choleric </p><p>jack-in-the-box who could up-end the entire process. </p><p>Conversely, the NSA explained, Nigeria had no ulterior </p><p>motives but was merely seeking to provide a venue where </p><p>discussions could take place and was seeking the support of </p><p>the UN, U.S. and EU for this effort.  (COMMENT:  The </p><p>statement about pristine non-interest does not entirely ring </p><p>true.  Nigeria is trying to cast itself as an important </p><p>catalyst in African diplomacy.  Moreover, with an Islamic </p><p>North that usually wields national power and a fractious </p><p>Christian South, there is a certain impressionistic </p><p>similarity between the two states that beckons to the </p><p>Nigerians as they grapple with their own internal conflicts. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>DROC - A MISSED MEETING </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NSA stated that "Baby Kabila" (as President </p><p>Obasanjo calls him) briefly had visited Nigeria for a meeting </p><p>with Bemba, Onusumba and President Obasanjo on October 2. </p><p>However, the other two were no shows.  Recounting the events </p><p>that led to the abortive meeting, the NSA explained that </p><p>Onusumba had been unable to make an airline connection from </p><p>Brussels.  Bemba had therefore decided not to come to Abuja, </p><p>fearing he would be accused of striking a secret deal if he </p><p>met Kabila alone.  Kabila had a short meeting with President </p><p>Obasanjo.  Meanwhile, all three agreed to try again.  The GON </p><p>hoped to arrange the discussions for 12-13 October. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Responding to Ambassador Jeter\'s question whether the </p><p>NSA expected any breakthrough, the NSA struck a much more </p><p>positive note about President Kabila than in the past (Ref </p><p>A).  The NSA described Kabila as intelligent and as having a </p><p>vision for his country that would lead him to make </p><p>compromises.  However, the NSA cautioned, the Kabila </p><p>government only controlled Kinshasa and its environs. </p><p>Additionally, Kabila was surrounded by his father\'s henchmen </p><p>who did not embrace all of Kabila the Younger\'s more </p><p>progressive ways. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================================== </p><p>BURUNDI - A NEW ROLE FOR OBASANJO? </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked whether President Obasanjo had </p><p>asked the National Assembly\'s permission to send troops to </p><p>Burundi, as reported in the Nigerian press.  The NSA stated </p><p>that Burundi had sought Nigeria\'s assistance, and thus Army </p><p>Minister Batagarawa had visited Burundi the previous week. </p><p>As a result, Nigeria, along with two other countries (South </p><p>Africa and possibly Senegal), were considering sending </p><p>peacekeeping forces there.  Obasanjo needed approval from the </p><p>Nigerian legislature.  More significantly, the NSA stated </p><p>that President Mandela had asked President Obasanjo to take </p><p>over his role as mediator.  (COMMENT:  Obasanjo himself later </p><p>told Ambassador Jeter, however, that he would not take over </p><p>Mandela\'s role but would work more closely with Mandela on </p><p>the Burundi problem than he has done in the past.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Lamido observed that President Mandela was "tiring and </p><p>not well" and wanted out of the process but did not want his </p><p>exit to create a vacuum in the peace process.  Thus Mandela </p><p>had to seek a personality with high stature to fill his role. </p><p> The NSA did not indicate if President Obasanjo had agreed to </p><p>Mandela\'s request.  (COMMENT:  During a later conversation, </p><p>the SA to the Army Minister told PolMilOff that he and his </p><p>Minister had in fact met in Arusha last week.  He was jetting </p><p>off with his Minister (Lawal Batagarawa) to meet again with </p><p>the same cast of characters, this time on October 11 in </p><p>Pretoria.  He expected a Head of State meeting would take </p><p>place in South Africa in the near future, but was unsure who </p><p>would attend.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: In its quest to be a preeminent Continental </p><p>actor, Nigeria continues to play a useful role, such as the </p><p>recently negotiated Abuja agreement on Zimbabwe, and has had </p><p>some successes, such as the recently negotiated peace in </p><p>Sierra Leone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: NSA Mohammed clearly signaled </p><p>Nigeria\'s willingness to work with us on Sudan.  Washington </p><p>and Abuja\'s interests in Sudan generally coincide.  In </p><p>tandem, we could do much to advance the process as well as to </p><p>demonstrate the utility of a stronger U.S.-Nigeria </p><p>partnership in Continental peacekeeping matters. </p><p>12. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: If we do not work together, this </p><p>will complicate the Sudanese process and throw dirt on the </p><p>foreign policy aspect of our bilateral relationship.  Working </p><p>with Nigeria will also lessen the perception that our latest </p><p>efforts in Sudan are faith-based and perhaps even </p><p>anti-Islamic, a perception that we must assiduously guard </p><p>against at this time.  Consequently, it would be extremely </p><p>useful for Senator Danforth to meet President Obasanjo soon </p><p>in order to coordinate efforts on the Sudan, preferably </p><p>before the Senator travels to Khartoum.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
