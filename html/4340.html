<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001479 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI: CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD CASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Razali told diplomats at an early evening </p><p>briefing today that the dialog between the NLD and the SPDC </p><p>appeared to be stalled as much by a personality conflict </p><p>between Aung San Suu Kyi and Than Shwe as anything else. </p><p>Each one is imperious in his own way and neither is ready to </p><p>compromise.  The visit also made clear that Than Shwe was the </p><p>decision-maker in Burma; any commitments made by Khin Nyunt </p><p>had to be confirmed by Than Shwe.  That said, Khin Nyunt had </p><p>broached the idea of reconvening a reformulated National </p><p>Convention -- a suggestion that is apparently acceptable, at </p><p>least in principle, to both ASSK and the ethnic parties. </p><p>Khin Nyunt also suggested that 200 to 300 additional </p><p>political prisoners and security detainees could be released </p><p>by the close of the year, though, again, as with all other </p><p>matters, Than Shwe failed to confirm the commitment. Finally, </p><p>Razali confirmed that he would continue as Special Envoy, </p><p>with his next visit possibly occurring early next year. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UN Special Envoy Razali told diplomats November 15 </p><p>that he would continue in his role as facilitator for the </p><p>talks between the NLD and the GOB.  He was, he said, </p><p>beginning to get a feel for "the complexities of the </p><p>situation".  He had met with Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi representatives of the ethnic communities and Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe and understood now that there were at least </p><p>"two levels of decision-making" within the SPDC.  Any </p><p>commitments by Khin Nyunt had to be confirmed by Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe.  Furthermore, there was probably blame on </p><p>both sides for the lack of progress on the dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Razali described his meeting with Khin Nyunt as "very </p><p>good, very candid and very relaxed."  Razali took Khin Nyunt </p><p>up on his failure to deliver on his August promise to Razali </p><p>regarding the start of real dialog. Khin Nyunt said he was </p><p>doing his best, trying to act "as a catalyst between the NLD </p><p>and the SPDC."\' However, every aspect of exchanges with the </p><p>NLD were examined every week in detail by the SPDC.  As a </p><p>result, it was difficult to move forward on anything.  Khin </p><p>Nyunt also told Razali that there was "a channel of </p><p>discussion" between the NLD and the SPDC.  The Minister of </p><p>Education (a cousin of Than Shwe, he is also Secretary </p><p>General of the USDA), the Deputy Minister of Information and </p><p>Brigadier General Than Thun had met four times with Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi in "round table discussions" which Khin Nyunt </p><p>described as "positive and constructive."  in the same </p><p>breath, however, he also complained that ASSK had to take the </p><p>discussions more seriously.  Seemingly, she was disdainful of </p><p>both the participants and the topics on the table.  In fact, </p><p>Razali said, when he met with her, she was scornful of the </p><p>meetings with the Minister of Education et al. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Khin Nyunt also told Razali that he is prepared to </p><p>reconvene the National Convention with adjustments in its </p><p>rules and procedures, though, when pushed on what adjustments </p><p>would be made, was vague.  Similarly, Khin Nyunt also </p><p>suggested that as many as 300 additional political prisoners </p><p>and security detainees could be released before the close of </p><p>the year. Aung San Suu Kyi, Razali said, agreed that the NLD </p><p>would rejoin a properly reformulated National Convention. </p><p>According to Razali, representatives of ethnic parties also </p><p>accepted the idea of a reconvened Convention. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Than Shwe gave Razali only fifteen minutes, but that </p><p>was enough to convince Razali that Khin Nyunt and Than Shwe </p><p>were not always on the same page.  Than Shwe for instance did </p><p>not commit to reconvening the National Convention and, </p><p>according to Razali, even now he cannot say whether or not </p><p>the GOB will go that route.  Similarly, when the topic turned </p><p>to consultations with the NLD regarding humanitarian </p><p>assistance for Burma -- an idea which Khin Nyunt had accepted </p><p>-- Than Shwe, while not saying a word, gave every indication </p><p>of acute discomfort.  He also failed to confirm Khin Nyunt\'s </p><p>commitment on the release of political prisoners.  The most </p><p>he would say is that he would "do the best for the country." </p><p>Than Shwe also vetoed Razali\'s final meeting with Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi, which had been scheduled for Taungyi in Shan State, </p><p>where she is traveling on NLD business.  According to Than </p><p>Shwe, ASSK was on a "political tour" and any meeting by </p><p>Razali with her while she was on that tour would show undue </p><p>favoritism for the NLD. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In general, Razali concluded that the relationship </p><p>between ASSK and Than Shwe was extremely difficult.  There </p><p>was a great deal of suspicion of ASSK\'s activities and </p><p>apparently Than Shwe felt that somehow, somewhere ASSK had </p><p>offended him on two occasions, though nobody would say </p><p>exactly what the offense was.  As for ASSK, she simply had a </p><p>"hard personality" that Than Shwe (and others) had difficulty </p><p>dealing with. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On other topics, Razali said that he had been warned </p><p>not to raise Burma\'s economic situation with Than Shwe. </p><p>Presumably, the senior general had gotten an earful from </p><p>other ASEAN members during the ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh. </p><p>He also suggested that he might be back in January or </p><p>February for what will be his tenth visit. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
