(U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST, SEE PARAGRAPH FIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) IN A WORRISOME AND UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT, THE </p><p>GOI HAS ISSUED A LEGISLATIVE DECREE WITH A PROVISION </p><p>THAT, IF ADOPTED IN ITS CURRENT FORM, WOULD REDUCE THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT FOR TELECOM COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN TELEPHONE </p><p>DATABASES FROM FIVE YEARS TO 18 MONTHS.  THE OMNIBUS </p><p>DECREE IS BEFORE THE JUSTICE COMMITTEES OF THE CHAMBER </p><p>R </p><p>AND SENATE, WHICH MUST ISSUE OPINIONS, ALTHOUGH NON- </p><p>BINDING, ON THE DECREE BEFORE JUNE 30. PARLIAMENT, IN A </p><p>2001 LAW, MANDATED THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO ISSUE PRIVACY- </p><p>RELATED DECREES, OF WHICH THIS OMNIBUS DECREE IS ONE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS IN THE SENATE AND </p><p>PRESS STORIES, THE SPECIFIC 18 MONTHS MEASURE WAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY VIGOROUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE ITALIAN PRIVACY </p><p>AUTHORITY, WHICH HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE BIG </p><p>BROTHER ASPECTS OF A FIVE-YEAR RETENTION RULE.  THE </p><p>AUTHORITY ALSO PURPORTEDLY ARGUED THAT COSTS TO MAINTAIN </p><p>DATA FOR FIVE YEARS WOULD BE EXCESSIVE. ITALIAN LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE AND IN </p><p>CONTRAST, HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE DATA </p><p>    HELD FOR EVEN LONGER PERIODS, POSSIBLY EVEN TEN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) AS NOTED ABOVE, THE DECREE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>PUBLICLY RELEASED, HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THE CHAMBER </p><p>AND SENATE, WHICH MUST RETURN OPINIONS NO LATER THAN JUNE </p><p>30.  ALTHOUGH OPINIONS ARE NON-BINDING, PARLIAMENT, IF IT </p><p>IT </p><p>HAS STRONG RESERVATIONS, COULD REQUEST THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>BRANCH TO REVIEW THE DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY BELIEVES THERES A </p><p>SMALL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE THE DEBATE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND REQUESTS WASHINGTON FOR ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE TALKING POINTS. INPUT FROM USEU </p><p>ALSO WOULD BE WELCOME.  WE SPECIFICALLY SEE THE VISIT OF </p><p>NUALA KELLY, CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY, ON JUNE 25, AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE </p><p>USG TO HELP INFLUENCE ITALIAN DECISION-MAKERS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN THE CHAMBER, SENATE AND PRIVACY AUTHORITY, REGARDING </p><p>THIS DRAFT DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT: WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PRIVACY </p><p>AUTHORITY IS LAYING DOWN A MARKER ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN </p><p>THE LEAD-UP TO ITALYS EU PRESIDENCY. IN A RECENT LETTER </p><p>TO EU COMMISSIONER PRODI, STEFANO RODOTA, PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN DATA COMMISSION, SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE </p><p>INTERIM PNR AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EU. </p><p>POST WILL CLOSELY WATCH THE AUTHORITY AND ALERT </p><p>T </p><p>WASHINGTON AND USEU SHOULD THE AUTHORITYS RUMBLINGS </p><p>ABOUT PRIVACY BECOME STRONGER. END COMMENT. </p><p>    SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02652 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
