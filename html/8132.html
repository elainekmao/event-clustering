The primary concern for Iraqis throughout the southern </p><p>region continues to be security.  The security situation is </p><p>improving gradually due to the efforts of Coalition forces </p><p>to establish new Iraqi police forces, but much work remains. </p><p>The lack of adequate resources or clear guidelines for local </p><p>units managing policing initiatives has led to great </p><p>inconsistency in the structures and activities in each city </p><p>or town.  In An Nasiriyah former police officers within </p><p>Coalition units are recruiting a local police force drawn </p><p>mostly from former police and limited in size by the ability </p><p>of Coalition patrols to monitor the activities of local </p><p>police.  In Basrah, Coalition military police (MP) are </p><p>conducting joint patrols with unarmed local recruits that </p><p>have little to no police training.  In Al Amarah, Coalition </p><p>MPs are using a similar model as in Basrah with additional </p><p>security provided by two local Marsh Arab militias. In other </p><p>towns, local leaders have declined offers of assistance from </p><p>Coalition forces and are self-policing.  The success of </p><p>local policing initiatives is dependent on the development </p><p>of an adequate legal system to provide the rules under which </p><p>police may function.  If civil unrest is to be avoided, </p><p>these stopgap measures must be followed quickly by more </p><p>systematic management of local security and justice issues </p><p>that builds on local initiatives already in place.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>POLICING IN AN NASIRIYAH </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The original police force in An Nasiriyah (including </p><p>traffic police) was close to 3,000 people.  Through </p><p>conversations with re-recruited police, Coalition forces </p><p>have concluded that policing was a default profession for </p><p>many men who could not find other jobs.  As of 2 May, the </p><p>new police force was comprised of approximately 300 men who </p><p>were registered and accepted by the Coalition in conjunction </p><p>with the town council to serve as policemen.  They were </p><p>still unarmed, but Coalition forces had plans to arm the </p><p>police once they felt more comfortable with the recruits </p><p>they had selected.  Many more men wanted to register but </p><p>Coalition forces did not have the capacity to monitor a </p><p>larger group.  The Coalition was slowly trying to vet the </p><p>new recruits through interviews and other checks against </p><p>intelligence information.  Several former policemen serving </p><p>with the Coalition forces controlling the town volunteered </p><p>to help with the recruitment and training of this police </p><p>force.  Though policing was not their primary </p><p>responsibility, these former police stepped in as the </p><p>driving force behind the reactivation of local policing in </p><p>An Nasiriyah. </p><p> </p><p>3.  One Coalition officer reported that his troops </p><p>conducting patrols in the town were spread very thin.  He </p><p>said that his one battalion was covering an area that would </p><p>normally be controlled by three battalions.  The four </p><p>companies within his battalion were each assigned a section </p><p>of the town to patrol every two hours.  House to house </p><p>searches for weapons were completed and many weapons were </p><p>confiscated and destroyed.  However, many private citizens </p><p>still have guns. </p><p> </p><p>4.  While Coalition patrols had not been fired upon in the </p><p>last weeks of April, they reported continued shooting among </p><p>the local population.  The shooting appeared to be isolated, </p><p>and Coalition forces attributed it to low-level crime or </p><p>"score-settling" between individuals or families.  Citizens </p><p>reported incidents to Coalition forces either on patrol or </p><p>at the police station.  For example, on 1 May, a woman came </p><p>to the police station and reported that four days prior, </p><p>seven men entered her home at night and shot her husband and </p><p>son.  Both men had returned from hospital and were </p><p>recovering from their bullet wounds.  She gave Coalition </p><p>forces a list of individuals she thought were responsible, </p><p>and it included two of the newly recruited police. </p><p>Coalition forces are investigating this particular incident, </p><p>but this illustrates the problem of recourse for victims </p><p>against police or other authority figures once the Coalition </p><p>forces pull out. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The scope of the violence remains limited in An </p><p>Nasiriyah to individual incidents and has not become </p><p>widespread between larger groups within the town.  However, </p><p>the number of incident reports received from the population </p><p>and the general level of fear in the town increased over the </p><p>three days prior to the DART visit on 2 May.  This increase </p><p>corresponded to the release of approximately 100 enemy </p><p>prisoners of war (EPWs) into An Nasiriyah each day over the </p><p>previous three days.  Though unable to confirm whether the </p><p>release of EPWs back into the town was the cause of the </p><p>increased fear among the population, Coalition forces are </p><p>concerned that some of the newly released EPWs were trying </p><p>to reinsert themselves in the town through fear.  While the </p><p>population continues to be reassured by their presence, </p><p>Coalition forces are concerned about a security vacuum when </p><p>they leave in a few months. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Local leaders in the smaller towns around An Nasiriyah </p><p>have told Coalition forces that they want to police </p><p>themselves.  When offered assistance in policing, local </p><p>leaders have refused the assistance and said they prefer to </p><p>handle community security on their own.  These small towns </p><p>are reportedly "taking care of" the local Fedayeen </p><p>themselves as well. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>POLICING IN BASRAH </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  There were 6,000 police officers in Basrah before the </p><p>conflict.   After the serious and widespread looting </p><p>throughout Basrah toward the end of April, the Coalition </p><p>military police (MPs) began an initiative to recruit and </p><p>train a new local police force.  They have compiled a </p><p>database of over 2,000 names of applicants.  The Coalition </p><p>is validating individuals through a system of intelligence </p><p>checks and interviews with the applicants and others in the </p><p>town.  They are beginning to further organize the force into </p><p>units with approximately 700 regular police participating in </p><p>joint patrols with the Coalition MPs and troops as on-the- </p><p>job training.  On 10 May, 460 traffic police joined a 500- </p><p>person "guard" force to protect important stationary </p><p>infrastructure.  In addition to the police force, the </p><p>Coalition MPs have begun a licensing process for private </p><p>security guards.  There are now four police stations open in </p><p>Basrah city and three others in surrounding areas. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Applicants to the police force are a mixture of former </p><p>police and new recruits.  While the majority are former </p><p>police, the higher-level officers in the former force have </p><p>disappeared and the returning recruits are from the lower </p><p>levels and often had jobs not directly related to policing. </p><p>The Coalition MP providing the description of the training </p><p>initiative to the DART said the former police force had many </p><p>drivers, administrators, and cleaners, but very few </p><p>employees actually involved in proper police responses and </p><p>investigations.  Therefore, most of the recruits, whether </p><p>new recruits or former police, need basic police training. </p><p>Recruits are participating in joint patrols with the </p><p>Coalition troops and MPs for on-the-job training but the </p><p>Coalition is still controlling and monitoring all activities </p><p>closely.  The MPs also have put together mobile training </p><p>teams that visit the various stations and train </p><p>approximately 20 people at a time in basic rules of </p><p>evidence, use of force, etc.  They also have plans for a </p><p>police academy that can train and professionalize the new </p><p>police force more formally, but they have not yet identified </p><p>funding for this initiative. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The primary challenge to the training of new police is </p><p>the lack of a basic legal system to regulate the police </p><p>procedures.  The lack of a legal system with judges and due </p><p>process in place also presents challenges to the ability of </p><p>the Coalition forces and local police to detain or process </p><p>criminals.  For now, low-level criminals such as petty </p><p>looters are arrested, warned and released.  If they find </p><p>repeat offenders, they keep them longer but still have no </p><p>means to process these individuals.  Coalition forces are </p><p>detaining perpetrators of 13 types of serious crime such as </p><p>rape or murder, and sending them down to the EPW camp in Umm </p><p>Qasr because there is nowhere locally to detain them. </p><p>Reportedly, about 150 such detentions have taken place under </p><p>Coalition authority. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POLICING IN AL AMARAH </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>10.  The policing efforts in Al Amarah are following the </p><p>same model as in Basrah with one interesting difference. </p><p>Residents of Al Amarah are very proud to refer to themselves </p><p>as "self-liberated" since they expelled most of the Baath </p><p>Party before the arrival of any Coalition forces.  The chief </p><p>of police, a former Baath Party member, changed sides to </p><p>join those opposing the regime just a few days before this </p><p>self-liberation took place.  He is still the chief of </p><p>police, and most of the existing local police force stayed </p><p>in place wearing the same uniforms as before the conflict </p><p>began.  Two powerful Marsh Arab leaders from the 1991 </p><p>uprising also have re-emerged with their own local militias, </p><p>which participated in this "self-liberation" and are now are </p><p>helping to patrol and secure the town.  Local leaders, </p><p>including the militias, have accepted Coalition oversight, </p><p>and Coalition forces have told them that there is no place </p><p>in Iraq for militias in the future.  For now though, these </p><p>armed militias that wear civilian clothes are helping with </p><p>security by manning checkpoints and providing an expanded </p><p>security coverage in the town.  As a result, Al Amarah has </p><p>had fewer problems with security and crime than other </p><p>places.  Looting and damage to government buildings was </p><p>limited to about two days before coalition forces arrived. </p><p> </p><p>11.  There may be troubling long-term implications, however, </p><p>of relying on a militia to supplement the joint patrols by </p><p>Coalition troops and civilian police.  It may be difficult </p><p>to get the militias to give up power.  In Al Amarah a new </p><p>local judicial structure is well on the way to establishment </p><p>by local lawyers that have elected new judges.  They have </p><p>issued proclamations on their desires for a new justice </p><p>system in that Governorate.  If supported and strengthened, </p><p>this local initiative appears to have the potential to </p><p>create checks on power consolidation in the town.  The </p><p>judges and lawyers are awaiting authorization and legitimacy </p><p>to be granted for their proposed system from the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) in </p><p>Baghdad.  Details on this emerging legal structure will be </p><p>reported via septel. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>PAYMENT OF POLICE AND OTHER CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Another critical need related to the new local police </p><p>forces is the payment of salaries.  Along with all civil </p><p>servants, new police are eager to receive their salaries. </p><p>Due to the delay in getting a national scheme for the </p><p>payment of civil servants in place, Coalition forces are </p><p>trying to solve the problem.  In An Nasiriyah, the new town </p><p>council identified state money in a local bank that they </p><p>authorized the Coalition to use to pay salaries of </p><p>approximately 50,000 civil servants in the governorate. </p><p>They were using a pay scale of USD 10 equivalent for </p><p>unskilled labor, USD 15 for skilled labor, and a maximum of </p><p>USD 22 for managerial positions.  The exchange rate used was </p><p>1400 Iraqi dinar per dollar.  The police were the first of </p><p>the civil servants to be paid in early May.  Coalition </p><p>forces estimated they had enough Iraqi dinars to pay two </p><p>months\' worth of salaries for all the civil servants in the </p><p>Governorate.  They turned money over to the heads of </p><p>individual departments for dispersement to their staff. </p><p>Similarly Coalition forces have identified local cash </p><p>reserves in banks and used them to pay initial salaries to </p><p>police in Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Important issues related to providing needed security </p><p>in Iraq including policing, paying civil servant salaries, </p><p>protecting sensitive documents and physical evidence, </p><p>developing local judicial structures, and rebuilding social </p><p>infrastructure are being addressed through the creative </p><p>efforts of local units of the Coalition, non-governmental </p><p>organizations (NGOs), and emerging local Iraqi leadership. </p><p>While these initiatives are addressing the most pressing </p><p>needs for now, none are adequate or sustainable over the </p><p>medium- to long-term without support.  The legal parameters </p><p>developing in the broader system in Baghdad should be </p><p>communicated to the military units and local leaders in the </p><p>various Governorates working on policing and local justice. </p><p>Such guidance should encourage these emerging local </p><p>initiatives in the right direction toward a locally driven, </p><p>yet consistent system of security and justice for the new </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
