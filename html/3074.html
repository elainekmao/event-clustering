<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PD, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DAILY NEWS EDITORIAL ON US FOOD ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Looking a gift horse in the mouth" </p><p>   the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>   June 5 editorial to calling on the government of </p><p>   Zimbabwe to "avoid politicizing food aid."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "For the estimated six million of the 13 million </p><p>   Zimbabweans on the verge of starvation, the issue </p><p>   of whether the food before them is genetically </p><p>   modified or not is luxury they cannot afford. </p><p>   Their preoccupation is with surviving the current </p><p>   food crisis.  The USA last week gave Zimbabwe </p><p>   18,500 tons of maize, in order to ease the current </p><p>   food shortage.  However, 10,000 tons of the </p><p>   consignment was rejected because it did not have a </p><p>   certificate declaring it was not produced through </p><p>   genetic engineering. . .  If the origin of the </p><p>   grain was unclear, a simple request to the </p><p>   Americans indicating concern about the possibility </p><p>   of the consignment being genetically modified, </p><p>   would certainly have been responded to and the </p><p>   fears by Zimbabwe either confirmed or allayed.  It </p><p>   is possible the government is allowing the standoff </p><p>   between Washington and Harare over the Zimbabwe </p><p>   Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, which slaps </p><p>   \'smart\' sanctions on President Mugabe, his two Vice </p><p>   Presidents, senior government ministers, officials </p><p>   and the ZANU PF leadership, to get in the way of </p><p>   international efforts to respond to the country\'s </p><p>   humanitarian crisis.  This is a desperate situation </p><p>   and it is doubtful whether the people affected </p><p>   would elect to starve instead of consuming alleged </p><p>   genetically modified food.  Which is the lesser of </p><p>   the two evils  - to die of hunger or as a </p><p>   consequence of the suspected effects of genetically </p><p>   modified food?  There is need to be less hysterical </p><p>   and avoid politicizing food </p><p>   aid. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
