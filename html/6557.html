<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/M, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, IIP/G/NEA- </p><p>SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 19: PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>SPEECH/IRAQ DEADLINE; WAR PREPARATIONS IN KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary: President Bush\'s call for Saddam Hussein and </p><p>his sons to leave Iraq within 48 hours was echoed by </p><p>Kuwait\'s National Assembly on March 18. Commentators point </p><p>out that the President\'s ultimatum reflects the proposal of </p><p>Oman\'s Sheikh Zayed for Saddam\'s exile, but that the time </p><p>for that option has passed. </p><p> </p><p>While there are reportedly no plans to close Kuwait </p><p>International Airport, British Airways suspended all of its </p><p>flights in and out of Kuwait on March 18. </p><p> </p><p>Characterizations of military action against Iraq as a war </p><p>of liberation "in order for the Iraqis to enjoy the wealth </p><p>of its nation," share the opinion pages with opposition to </p><p>such action. One commentator writes that US confidence does </p><p>not guarantee success, and that the US could be drawn into a </p><p>longer conflict, "similar to Israel\'s involvement in </p><p>Lebanon." Regarding the implications for the UN, another </p><p>writer opines: "the fate of the United Nations is similar to </p><p>that of the League of Nations, not because [the UN] failed </p><p>to deal with the Iraqi regime, but because Washington </p><p>decided to overstep its bounds under pressure from Christian- </p><p>Zionist radicals."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: All papers report that Sheikh Sabah Al- </p><p>Ahmad, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, announced that Kuwait is ready to deal with all </p><p>contingencies in the event of war. He stressed that Kuwait </p><p>has ample supplies of gasoline, medicine, food and water. </p><p> </p><p>On March 18, widely-read daily Al-Qabas reports that the </p><p>Kuwaiti National Assembly called for Saddam to step down. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam front-pages GCC Secretary General Al-Atiyyah\'s </p><p>comment after his March 18 arrival in Kuwait that Saddam </p><p>should "make a brave decision" and leave Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan carried on its front page a statement by Kuwait </p><p>Airways Director of Public Relations that there are no plans </p><p>to close Kuwait International Airport in the event of war. </p><p>All papers report that British Airways has halted its </p><p>flights to and from Kuwait until further notice. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas front-pages the Kuwaiti National Guard announcement </p><p>that it will deploy on Kuwait\'s streets and around vital </p><p>installations and in residential areas. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas carries an exclusive two-page interview with </p><p>Ambassador Richard Jones on March 19. Ambassador Jones said </p><p>the conflict could begin at any time after 4:15 a.m. </p><p>Thursday [Kuwait local time]- exactly 48 hours after the end </p><p>of President Bush\'s speech. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Interior said that unidentified persons </p><p>wrote graffiti against Kuwaiti State Security and slogans </p><p>calling for "death to America" in the Quortuba district of </p><p>Kuwait City, Al-Qabas reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that a former Russian General stated </p><p>that the US has deployed nuclear weapons to Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The Zero Hour is Approaching" </p><p>Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/19): </p><p>"President Bush stressed that the goal of the war on Iraq is </p><p>to liberate the Iraqi people from the tyrant Saddam in order </p><p>for the Iraqis to enjoy the wealth and its nation. The US </p><p>and its allies will definitely win this war. Therefore, we </p><p>wish that Arab leaders would call on Saddam to convince him </p><p>to step down from power to avert this destructive war." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Opportunity Which The Arabs Lost" </p><p>Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/19): </p><p>"The is no more chance for any peaceful solution, or any way </p><p>to stop the prospective war on Iraq after President Bush\'s </p><p>address to the nation. President Bush\'s ultimatum is a </p><p>translation of Shaikh Zayed\'s initiative [for Saddam to go </p><p>into exile], which the Arabs ignored during their summit in </p><p>Sharm El-Shaikh." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Fate of the League of Nations" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Daeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (3/19): </p><p>"President Bush stated in his address: `The Security Council </p><p>did not carry out its responsibility, and that is why the US </p><p>will take action.\' This statement was not a warning to </p><p>Saddam as much as it was to the United Nations. Today, the </p><p>fate of the United Nations is similar to that of the League </p><p>of Nations, not because [the UN] failed to deal with the </p><p>Iraqi regime, but because Washington decided to overstep its </p><p>bounds under pressure from Christian-Zionist radicals. The </p><p>problem now is that there is no alternative to the </p><p>superpower." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Let us Hope for the Best" </p><p>Salah Al-Fadhli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (3/19): </p><p>"Preliminary indications show that America has the ability </p><p>to make its plans succeed, but history has shown us that </p><p>some things cannot be determined by force. America\'s entry </p><p>and its involvement in Iraq may be similar to Israel\'s </p><p>involvement in Lebanon. At this moment of time, we just pray </p><p>to God that innocent people will not be harmed and let us </p><p>hope for the best." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Whether the People Like it or Not" </p><p>Dr. Sami Nasser Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-A\'am </p><p>(3/19):  "Washington does not only want to dominate Iraq </p><p>economically, but it is also striving to dominate the region </p><p>surrounding Iraq like Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf </p><p>countries. To implement this strategy, the US Administration </p><p>has to start in changing the Iraqi regime. [but] all the </p><p>countries in the region are targets for the White House\'s </p><p>greediness, whether the people like it or not." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
