He pledged to consider the offer and advise Post </p><p>of the GOH\'s intentions in the near future.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  On October 17, 2002, PolOffs met with MOD Federico </p><p>Breve and presented the talking points in reftel.  We had </p><p>shared earlier the demarche with the MFA.  The MOD expressed </p><p>great interest in the offer to provide training and technical </p><p>assistance to combat arms trafficking in Honduras.  He </p><p>referred to the offer as "excellent," acknowledging that </p><p>Honduras has had problems properly controlling the arms cache </p><p>located in Naco. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The MOD underscored Honduras\' need for better </p><p>security of the Naco stockpile, and expressed his view that </p><p>the Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) needs to improve its </p><p>internal communications systems as well as administrative </p><p>controls.  Additionally, the MOD pointed out that the Naco </p><p>cache is the subject of litigation both in Honduras and </p><p>Miami, and that, therefore, destruction of the arms is not </p><p>currently an option.  However, he did acknowledge that the </p><p>type of training and assistance offered by the U.S. </p><p>government would benefit the GOH.  (NOTE:  Despite the </p><p>ongoing litigation, the HOAF are responsible for the security </p><p>of the Naco cache.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  MOD Breve could not provide an immediate and definite </p><p>response to the offer, but indicated that the GOH and HOAF </p><p>would be very interested in the proposed training and </p><p>technical assistance.  Post will follow up this week for a </p><p>formal MOD invitation so that Washington action agencies can </p><p>begin preparation to provide the training. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
