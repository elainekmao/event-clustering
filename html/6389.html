<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CA, Liberal Party </p><p>SUBJECT: SNAPSHOT OF CANADIAN POLITICS: THE RULING LIBERAL </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP CONTEST IS ON </p><p> </p><p>This message is sensitive, but unclassified.  Handle </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SUMMARY. Former Finance Minister Paul Martin Jr. filed </p><p>nomination papers for the leadership contest of the governing </p><p>Liberal Party on March 6. At this juncture, Heritage Minister </p><p>Sheila Copps, whose candidacy was declared on the first day </p><p>of the official campaign period, is the only other MP openly </p><p>running for the leadership. Deputy PM and current Finance </p><p>Minister John Manley is expected to toss his hat into the </p><p>ring in the near future.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Liberals have held power consecutively for a </p><p>decade under the leadership of Jean Chretien, who won three </p><p>successive Parliamentary majorities at general elections in </p><p>1993, 1997 and 2000 ) a rare feat in Canadian politics. </p><p>Nevertheless, the party owes a significant measure of its </p><p>success to Paul Martin Jr. for his strong performance as </p><p>Finance Minister during 1993-2002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The son of a prominent Liberal minister whose own </p><p>prime ministerial ambitions were never realized, Paul Martin </p><p>has been a Member of Parliament for some 15 years.  In </p><p>addition to his natural appeal to the business community (he </p><p>is a successful financier and industrialist in his own right) </p><p>Martin has cultivated important social and environmental </p><p>policymaking credentials.  Moreover, as Finance Minister </p><p>under Chretien, he turned around the nation,s serious budget </p><p>deficit into a surplus within a few years, while </p><p>simultaneously reducing unemployment and inflation )- a feat </p><p>that few &ex ante8 observers thought possible. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Despite his clear advantage early in the contest, </p><p>Paul Martin seems to be leaving nothing to chance, including </p><p>the timing of the official launch of his campaign in April, </p><p>from his home riding of LaSalle-Emard, Montreal, to </p><p>&maximize the impact8 on vote-getting.  In filing for </p><p>nomination-*which requires paying a deposit of half the </p><p>$75,000 candidacy fee by June 10--candidates get access to </p><p>bulk membership forms (allowing them to enlist new members in </p><p>groups of 100) and Liberal party membership lists that are </p><p>vital to any campaign.  Moreover, in light of the CAD 4 </p><p>million ceiling on official campaign expenditures, it is in </p><p>Martin,s interest to delay imposing such a constraint on his </p><p>war chest (he has been touring the country in unofficial </p><p>appearances since his resignation from Cabinet). </p><p> </p><p>THE MARTIN-CHRETIEN DYNAMIC </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) A long time political rival of Chretien, Martin,s </p><p>relationship with the Prime Minister has been especially </p><p>tense following their 1990 competition for the Liberal </p><p>leadership.  Martin,s adept handling of the finance </p><p>portfolio -- until that time considered a dead end for </p><p>leadership aspirants -- and his unceasing ambition for the </p><p>party leadership only aggravated the rivalry and culminated </p><p>in Martin,s resignation from Cabinet last summer. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) By that time, the former Finance Minister already </p><p>had developed a seemingly unassailable advantage in political </p><p>reputation and riding-by-riding organization, and an enviable </p><p>campaign war chest.  Although he placed second in the 1990 </p><p>leadership contest with only 25 percent of the vote, in the </p><p>intervening years Martin,s supporters diligently gained </p><p>control of key elements of the party machinery, enabling </p><p>their candidate to position well ahead of the pack in the </p><p>current contest.  His personal wealth and an apparent knack </p><p>for fundraising have given Martin the wherewithal to gain </p><p>name recognition and to publicize his credentials well ahead </p><p>of the official campaign season launched February 24. </p><p> </p><p>THE OTHER CONTESTANTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Although the names of other senior Ministers have </p><p>continued to surface as potential leadership contestants, few </p><p>have taken up the gauntlet seriously. Industry Minister Allan </p><p>Rock dropped out of possible contention in January 2003 and </p><p>Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal recently indicated </p><p>that he would not run for personal reasons. While Canadian </p><p>Heritage Minister Sheila Copps formalized her intentions in </p><p>February, she is said to have done so primarily at the urging </p><p>of PM Chretien, ostensibly to avoid the appearance of an </p><p>uncontested race for Paul Martin. It is expected that Copps </p><p>will receive a "golden parachute" from Chrtien in the form </p><p>of a coveted "permanent" patronage appointment before he </p><p>steps down. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, who also </p><p>succeeded Martin in the Finance portfolio, is expected to </p><p>announce his candidacy at some point. Observers speculate </p><p>that he will need to be assured of a strong second place </p><p>finish, in order to position himself for a good job in a </p><p>Martin Cabinet (Finance, Foreign Affairs) and a run at the </p><p>leadership post-Martin (Manley is 53 compared to Martin\'s </p><p>64).  As one Embassy contact commented, a weak finish for </p><p>Manley in a leadership race would not help his political </p><p>prospects, and he likely will want to avoid incurring heavy </p><p>campaign debt. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT:  At this time, some 8 months before the </p><p>November convention, Paul Martin is widely deemed the </p><p>probable successor to Chretien, certainly as leader of the </p><p>Liberals and likely as PM following a general election.  His </p><p>organizational lead, combined with personal wealth unmatched </p><p>by other candidates, continue to give him vast advantages in </p><p>the leadership race.  Although his ownership of the </p><p>multi-million dollar Canadian Steamship Lines has been under </p><p>attack as an ethics issue, Martin recently announced his </p><p>intent to cede ownership of the company and implement </p><p>additional transparency measures, in close consultation with </p><p>the current government Ethics Commissioner, to preclude any </p><p>question about his ties to/influence on the company "should" </p><p>he become Prime Minister.  END COMMENT. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
