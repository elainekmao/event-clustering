(U) Sensitive but unclassified, please protect </p><p>accordingly.  Not for Internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Dubbed Prime Minister Jean Chretien\'s "Legacy" </p><p>by Canadian analysts, the budget presented on February 18 </p><p>is the largest fiscal stimulus package since the Trudeau </p><p>era 20 years ago, and the second largest spending program </p><p>in 40 years.  The "Jean Billionaire Budget", with C$14.3 </p><p>billion this year (FY03-04), and C$38 billion over the </p><p>next five years, includes something for almost everyone </p><p>but few surprises. (Note:  using an exchange rate of 1C$ </p><p>= 66 UScents, new spending FY2003-2004 would be US$9.4 </p><p>billion and over five years, US$25.1 billion.) Despite </p><p>the 11.5% increase in spending (four times the rate of </p><p>inflation) this is the GOC\'s sixth consecutive balanced </p><p>budget and does provide for debt reduction. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Finance Minister John Manley was able to use his </p><p>first budget as a launching pad in his bid to succeed </p><p>Prime Minister Chretien. (Chretien has announced that he </p><p>will step down in February 2004.)  In his speech to </p><p>Parliament, Manley stressed benefits for children, the </p><p>homeless and First Nations (aboriginal) communities, </p><p>saying "you can\'t have a world of peace unless you </p><p>address the world of need."  His speech emphasized </p><p>commitment to making Canada a knowledge economy, and </p><p>expressed the wish that the maple leaf, wherever it is </p><p>seen in the world, will represent hope, compassion and </p><p>determination.  Manley also promised a thorough review of </p><p>government programs and expects to reallocate C$1 billion </p><p>a year to higher priority programs on a continuing basis. </p><p> </p><p>The Lion\'s Share for Health Care: 63% </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) As indicated in the Speech from the Throne (ref </p><p>A) and called for in the November 2002 Romanow Report, </p><p>health care spending takes the lion\'s share of the </p><p>budget.  Spending is slated to increase by C$34.8 billion </p><p>over the next five years - C$8.96 billion this year alone </p><p>- for 63 percent of total new spending of C$14.3 billion </p><p>this fiscal year.  Defense spending, in contrast, </p><p>receives 0.8% of this year\'s spending, for a total of </p><p>C$1.1 billion. Although the increase in defense spending </p><p>is less than some had hoped, it reverses years of </p><p>significant declines and is a big step in the right </p><p>direction for Canada\'s military.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  As in past years, the GOC </p><p>intentionally leaked many budget proposals.  Financial </p><p>markets had discounted the GOC\'s spending, and the </p><p>Canadian dollar remained stable.  Some analysts contend </p><p>that the markets will ignore this budget because it can </p><p>be viewed as "just a one-year change in policy" until the </p><p>end of Chretien\'s tenure.  With the generous spending to </p><p>support the Prime Minister\'s swan song "wish list," </p><p>Finance Minister Manley was able maintain Canada\'s image </p><p>of fiscal prudence only in comparison to the fiscal </p><p>deterioration of the rest of the G7.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Budget Overview:  Risks are from the U.S. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Economic Assumptions: </p><p>-- 3.2% real GDP growth in 2003 (highest in the G7) </p><p>-- 3.5% real GDP growth in 2004 </p><p>-- Risks include uncertain economic recovery in the U.S. </p><p>and geopolitical concerns, especially possible war in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Fiscal Projections: The Sun Will Keep Shining </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada is the only G7 country to record a surplus in </p><p>FY2000-2001 (C$15B) and FY2001-2002 (C$8.2B).  The </p><p>Liberal Party is committed to "balanced budgets or </p><p>beyond" from this year (FY2002-2003) through FY2004-2005, </p><p>a promise that has traditionally resulted in surpluses. </p><p> </p><p>-- Debt reduction payments of C$47.6 billion in FY2001- </p><p>2002 lowered the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 46.5%, from </p><p>51.8% in the previous year.  (The debt-to-GDP ratio is </p><p>projected to drop to 40% by FY2004-2005.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOC\'s Contingency Reserve will remain at $3 </p><p>billion, while "Economic Prudence" will rise to C$1 </p><p>billion in this fiscal year and C$2 billion next fiscal </p><p>year, from zero the past two years.  Note:  Economic </p><p>Prudence is a reserve set aside for unforeseen factors </p><p>that could undermine economic performance, such as global </p><p>political and economic uncertainties.  No funds were </p><p>needed for "Economic Prudence" in the previous two fiscal </p><p>years because the Canadian economy performed above </p><p>expectations.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Spending Initiatives: Something For Everyone </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>Total new spending of C$25 billion over three years </p><p>covers most sectors, although some, such as health care, </p><p>have five-year spending commitments or longer. </p><p> </p><p>Health Care and Other Social Spending </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-- The C$34.8 billion committed for increased spending in </p><p>health care over five years includes: </p><p> </p><p>-- A five-year C$16 billion Health Reform Fund for the </p><p>provinces and territories to target primary health care, </p><p>home care and catastrophic drug coverage. </p><p> </p><p>-- A C$9.5 billion increase in cash transfers to the </p><p>provinces and territories over five years. </p><p> </p><p>-- An immediate investment of C$2.5 billion through the </p><p>Canada Health and Social Transfer supplement (with </p><p>details left to the discretion of the respective </p><p>provinces). </p><p> </p><p>-- C$5.5 billion in health reform initiatives, including </p><p>diagnostic/medical equipment and a six-week compassionate </p><p>leave benefit under employment insurance. </p><p> </p><p>-- C$1.3 billion to support First Nations\' health </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>-- C$5.6 billion in social spending for the homeless, </p><p>childcare, and affordable housing. </p><p> </p><p>Defense, Security, Foreign Aid:  Reversing decline </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>-- An increase of C$800 million for Canadian military </p><p>capabilities in each of the next three years. (Note:  in </p><p>his speech, the FinMin said "every year," without </p><p>specifying a time limit.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- C$170 million this fiscal year for urgent capital </p><p>requirements, maintenance of capital equipment, spare </p><p>parts, the purchase of new capital equipment and other </p><p>expenses. </p><p> </p><p>-- C$100 million to support the military commitment in </p><p>Afghanistan ("Operation Apollo"). </p><p> </p><p>-- C$75 million in each of the next two years for the </p><p>Security Contingency Reserve, to enable the GOC to </p><p>respond to unforeseen security needs, including border </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>--  Nearly C$500 million annually in foreign aid (an 8% </p><p>increase), for a total of C$1.4 billion over the next </p><p>three fiscal years. </p><p> </p><p>Sustainable Development (including Kyoto implementation): </p><p>Still Vague </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>The budget allocates C$3 billion to environmental </p><p>initiatives, including: </p><p> </p><p>--   C$2 billion over five years to implement the Kyoto </p><p>Accord; </p><p> </p><p>--   C$1 billion for other environmental measures. </p><p> </p><p>Note:  There are still no details on how the Kyoto </p><p>implementation funds will be spent.  End note </p><p> </p><p>Refining the Tax System </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Manley prefaced his comments on tax changes by saying </p><p>this budget supports improved corporate governance and </p><p>regulation.  The budget will: </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduce the corporate tax rate to 21% from 28% over the </p><p>next five years while making other changes to the </p><p>corporate tax structure. </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduce the tax on resource income to 21% over five </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Raise RRSP and RRP (pension plan) contribution limits </p><p>to C$18,000 over four years, and index the new limits. </p><p> </p><p>-- Eliminate the federal capital tax over the next five </p><p>years, with medium-sized businesses benefiting first. </p><p>(Initially, the capital threshold at which the tax </p><p>applies will be raised from C$10 million to C$50 million </p><p>effective in January 2004.  As of January 2004, medium- </p><p>sized businesses under the C$50 million threshold will no </p><p>longer have to pay the tax.  Second, the rate of the tax </p><p>will be reduced in stages over a period of five years so </p><p>that by 2008, the tax will be completely eliminated.  No </p><p>changes are proposed to the special capital tax on large </p><p>financial institutions.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduce the airport security tax from C$24 to C$14 per </p><p>round trip after March 1. </p><p> </p><p>-- Increase the film and video production services tax </p><p>credit from 11% to 16% of qualified Canadian labor </p><p>expenditures.  The GOC will to continue to consult with </p><p>the Canadian film industry to develop criteria for a </p><p>streamlined mechanism for delivering the tax credit, </p><p>which in turn could provide a refundable tax credit of </p><p>25% of qualified labor expenditures for Canadian film or </p><p>video productions. </p><p> </p><p>Other items </p><p>----------- </p><p>-- C$2 billion has been earmarked for "innovation and </p><p>skills," such as research grants and scholarships. </p><p>Manley highlighted in his speech that this year a greater </p><p>proportion of scholarships will support social science </p><p>scholars.  He also stressed the allocation of C$114.5 </p><p>million over 5 years to support dual language </p><p>proficiency. </p><p> </p><p>-- C$5.2 billion over six years in farm aid </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
