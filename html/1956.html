REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 2642 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE SEPTEMBER 8-9 BULAWAYO MAYORAL ELECTION AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION IN MAKONI WEST WERE MARRED BY MISSION- </p><p>OBSERVED IRREGULARITIES, WHICH WOULD LEAD US TO CHARACTERIZE THEM </p><p>RESPECTIVELY AS "FLAWED" AND "NOT FREE AND FAIR."  IN BULAWAYO, </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS OF VOTERS WERE TURNED AWAY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, </p><p>AND THE USE OF A LARGE SUPPLEMENTARY VOTERS ROLL WHICH HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN MADE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION RAISED </p><p>CONCERNS IN THE MINDS OF OBSERVERS.  IN MID-AFTERNOON ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>10, THE ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNOUNCED THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAD WON ALL SEVEN CITY COUNCIL SEATS, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MAYORAL RESULT UNTIL LATER ON SEPTEMBER 10 OR </p><p>EARLY ON SEPTEMBER 11.  IN MAKONI WEST, VOTING WAS MOSTLY PEACEFUL </p><p>ALTHOUGH 3,000 FEWER VOTES WERE CAST THAN IN THE JUNE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  WE OBSERVED THAT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF </p><p>VOTERS WERE TURNED AWAY AT POLLING STATIONS, AND GOZ AND/OR ZANU- </p><p>PF OFFICIALS TRAVELLED FREELY IN THE CONSTITUENCY, GIVING ORDERS </p><p>TO POLICE OFFICERS AND OTHER RELEVANT ELECTORAL OFFICIALS AT </p><p>POLLING STATIONS.  THE FINAL RESULTS LIKELY WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11.  IN MAKONI WEST, WE DISCERNED AN EMERGING GOZ </p><p>STRATEGY TO TRY TO CONTROL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BY TELLING DIPLOMATS NO ACCREDITATION WAS </p><p>REQUIRED WHILE INSTRUCTING RELEVANT LOCAL OFFICIALS NOT TO SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION WITHOUT PROOF OF ACCREDITATION.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02666  01 OF 03  101552Z </p><p>BULAWAYO </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MAYORAL ELECTION IN BULAWAYO SEPTEMBER 8-9 WAS MOSTLY </p><p>PEACEFUL, BUT WAS MARRED BY A NUMBER OF IRREGULARITIES, OBSERVED </p><p>FIRST-HAND BY EMBASSY OFFICERS.  AS THE SECOND DAY OF VOTING DREW </p><p>TO AN END, ONLY 16 PERCENT OF REGISTERED VOTERS HAD CAST THEIR </p><p>BALLOTS, IN CONTRAST TO 46 PERCENT IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION (60,000 VERSUS 170,000, OUT OF A TOTAL OF 369,294 </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS).  IT IS DIFFICULT TO DRAW ANY DEFINITIVE </p><p>CONCLUSIONS FROM THE LOW TURNOUT FIGURES, AS ZIMBABWEANS RARELY </p><p>TURN UP IN LARGE NUMBERS TO VOTE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS.  WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT, IN THE FIRST DIRECT ELECTION FOR </p><p>BULAWAYO\'S MAYOR IN THE MID-1990\'S, ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS CAST BALLOTS.  ADDITIONAL FACTORS THIS TIME WERE </p><p>LIKELY A WIDESPREAD EXPECTATION THAT THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WOULD WIN HANDILY AND A RELUCTANCE TO RISK </p><p>ONE\'S SKIN TO VOTE IN A MAYORAL ELECTION.  WE ALSO HAVE HEARD </p><p>COMPLAINTS THAT THERE WERE TOO FEW POLLING STATIONS; THEY WERE FAR </p><p>APART, MAKING ACCESS PROBLEMATIC FOR THOSE WITHOUT CARS.  SHARI </p><p>EPPEL, DIRECTOR OF THE BULAWAYO BRANCH OF THE RESPECTED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AMANI TRUST, TOLD US THAT GROUPS OF ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS WERE DROPPED THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE ELECTION IN SEVERAL </p><p>TOWNSHIPS, WHERE THEY SUBJECTED THE RESIDENTS TO THREATS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  WE ALSO HEARD REPORTS OF LARGE NUMBERS </p><p>OF ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS BEING BUSED IN ON THE VOTING DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM A VARIETY OF RELIABLE SOURCES </p><p>REPORTS OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES IN BULAWAYO.  A HIGH NUMBER </p><p>OF VOTERS, FOR INSTANCE -- RANGING BETWEEN TEN AND FORTY PERCENT </p><p>AT EACH POLLING STATION -- WERE TURNED AWAY, EITHER BECAUSE THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02666  01 OF 03  101552Z </p><p>NAMES WERE NOT ON THE ROLL OR BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PRESENT </p><p>PROPER IDENTIFICATION.   EMBASSY OFFICERS SPOKE WITH MANY PEOPLE </p><p>WHO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE, A MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE MALES </p><p>BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 45, A DEMOGRAPHIC WIDELY ASSUMED IN </p><p>THIS REGION TO BE SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THE MDC.  WE ALSO HAVE HEARD </p><p>TROUBLING ACCOUNTS OF VOTER ROLL MANIPULATION.  BELINDA MUSANO, </p><p>DEPUTY COORDINATOR OF THE ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK </p><p>(ZESN), WHICH CONDUCTS THE DOMESTIC MONITORING EFFORT, TOLD </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF THAT A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS HAD CONFIRMED </p><p>THEIR NAMES WERE ON THE VOTERS ROLL DURING THE PERIOD OF PUBLIC </p><p>INSPECTION (JUNE 25-JULY 16), BUT ARRIVED ON VOTING DAY TO FIND </p><p>THAT THEIR NAMES HAD BEEN REMOVED.  MOST OF THE RESIDENTS IN THIS </p><p>SITUATION WERE REPORTEDLY WHITE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN ADDITION, A SUPPLEMENTARY VOTERS ROLL -- WHICH WAS </p><p>NEVER MADE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION -- WAS SEEN </p><p>AT SOME POLLING STATIONS, AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, IT WAS THICKER </p><p>THAN THE REGULAR ROLL.  THERE ALSO WAS SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION ABOUT </p><p>WHERE PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO VOTE.  MOST VOTERS BELIEVED THAT </p><p>THEY COULD CAST THEIR BALLOTS ANYWHERE IN THE CONSTITUENCY IN </p><p>WHICH THEY WERE REGISTERED, BUT WERE TOLD WHEN THEY SHOWED UP TO </p><p>VOTE THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO VOTE IN THE WARD IN WHICH THEY </p><p>WERE RESIDENT (A CONSTITUENCY COMPRISES SEVERAL WARDS).  THIS </p><p>REQUIREMENT WAS APPARENTLY IMPOSED BECAUSE SEVEN CITY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1673 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02666  02 OF 03  101553Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------1CFF96  101553Z /38 </p><p>P 101538Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9678 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BULAWAYO MAYORAL VOTE AND MAKONI WEST BY-ELECTION MARRED </p><p>BY IRREGULARITIES </p><p> </p><p>SEATS -- REPRESENTING PARTICULAR WARDS -- WERE ON THE BALLOT BUT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02666  02 OF 03  101553Z </p><p>BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PRE-ELECTION VOTER EDUCATION, VOTERS WERE </p><p>NEVER INFORMED OF THIS REQUIREMENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ONE INCIDENT WHICH HAS GARNERED SIGNIFICANT PRESS </p><p>ATTENTION WAS THE SEPTEMBER 9 ARREST IN BULAWAYO OF THREE </p><p>BODYGUARDS OF MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DAVID COLTART.  COLTART </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE BODYGUARDS WERE ARRESTED AFTER VIDEOTAPING A </p><p>LARGE BUS OFF-LOADING YOUNG MEN WITH SHAVED HEADS WHOM THEY </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE TROUBLEMAKERS OR ILLEGAL VOTERS BROUGHT IN BY THE </p><p>RULING PARTY.  THE BODYGUARDS WERE DETAINED AND CHARGED WITH </p><p>FIREARMS VIOLATIONS AFTER A SEARCH OF THEIR HOUSES TURNED UP 17 </p><p>GUNS.  COLTART INSISTED THAT HIS BODYGUARDS HAVE LICENSES FOR EACH </p><p>OF THE FIREARMS, BUT THEY REMAINED IN DETENTION AS OF LATE </p><p>AFTERNOON SEPTEMBER 10. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS HOW MUCH THE IRREGULARITIES </p><p>AFFECTED THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY WERE </p><p>SERIOUS AND NUMEROUS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY A DESCRIPTION OF THE </p><p>ELECTION AS "FLAWED" AND RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TACTICS WE ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO SEE EMPLOYED IN FUTURE BY-ELECTIONS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION EXPECTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) SHORTLY BEFORE THIS CABLE WENT TO PRESS, THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC) ANNOUNCED THAT THE MDC HAD WON ALL </p><p>SEVEN OF THE CITY COUNCIL SEATS, REPORTEDLY BY A HANDY MARGIN. </p><p>THE MAYORAL RESULT LIKELY WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED UNTIL LATE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 10 OR EARLY ON SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p> </p><p>MAKONI WEST </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02666  02 OF 03  101553Z </p><p>8.  (C) AFTER A PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN MAKONI WEST MARRED BY THE </p><p>INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT IN </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ELECTIONS (REFTEL) -- ALTHOUGH LESS INTENSE AND </p><p>WIDESPREAD THAN IN THE LAST THREE BY-ELECTIONS IN BINDURA, BIKITA </p><p>WEST, AND MARONDERA -- THE VOTING DAYS THEMSELVES SEPTEMBER 8-9 </p><p>WERE MOSTLY PEACEFUL.  VOTER TURNOUT WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN IN </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, AS THIS TIME 17,067 PEOPLE CAST </p><p>BALLOTS (OUT OF A TOTAL OF 42,788 REGISTERED VOTERS), IN CONTRAST </p><p>TO 20,279 IN JUNE 2000. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) U.S. EMBASSY OFFICERS OBSERVED THE VOTING, COORDINATING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH OTHER DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO ENSURE THAT ALL 44 </p><p>POLLING STATIONS RECEIVED A VISIT.  SEVERAL INCIDENTS PROVIDED </p><p>CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  ON SEPTEMBER 8, POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF CAME </p><p>ACROSS A GROUP OF 200-300 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM MEN APPARENTLY </p><p>UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY, WHO HAD BEEN TURNED AWAY, ALTHOUGH THEIR </p><p>NAMES WERE ON THE VOTERS ROLL.  THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY NOW HAD </p><p>TO VOTE IN THE CONSTITUENCY OF MUTARE WEST, EVEN THOUGH MOST HAD </p><p>CAST BALLOTS IN JUNE 2000 AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THEIR NEIGHBORS </p><p>HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE.  AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>DETERMINE, THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW DEMARCATION OF MAKONI WEST SINCE </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  WE DO NOT YET HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF </p><p>WHETHER THIS WAS MORE THAN AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, BUT WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>ANECDOTAL REPORTS OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE IN THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY.  AT MOST OF THE POLLING STATIONS WE OBSERVED, MORE </p><p>THAN TEN PERCENT OF VOTERS WERE TURNED AWAY EITHER BECAUSE THEY </p><p>WERE NOT ON THE VOTERS ROLL OR BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PRESENT </p><p>IDENTIFICATION SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE PRESIDING OFFICER.  (N.B. </p><p>WE ARE NOT CERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS DUE TO DELIBERATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTIONS OR POOR INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE VOTERS.) </p><p>WHEN THE CHIEF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\'S HARARE-BASED ELECTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02666  02 OF 03  101553Z </p><p>OBSERVATION UNIT SOUGHT AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE LOCAL REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL TO ASK ABOUT THIS AND OTHER ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES, THE </p><p>REGISTRAR-GENERAL REFUSED TO MEET WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) IN A PATTERN CONSISTENT WITH THAT IN PAST BY-ELECTIONS, </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND/OR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS WITHOUT ACCREDITATION MOVED </p><p>UNHINDERED IN AND OUT OF POLLING STATIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, GAVE </p><p>ORDERS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS ON-SITE.  AT ONE POLLING STATION, </p><p>MEN IN A VEHICLE WITH GOVERNMENT PLATES -- WHO DID NOT IDENTIFY </p><p>THEMSELVES -- HARASSED THE DRIVER OF OUR EMBASSY VEHICLE, TELLING </p><p>HIM WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE.  THEY TOLD THE DRIVER THAT, "IF </p><p>YOU ALL (IN AN APPARENT REFERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ) </p><p>INSIST ON CONTINUING TO OBSERVE, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE </p><p>TOUGHER."   THE EFFECTS OF THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION WERE CLEAR, AS EVERYONE -- THOSE WITH AN OFFICIAL </p><p>ROLE RELATED TO THE VOTING AS WELL AS ORDINARY VOTERS -- WERE </p><p>CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING TO US.  AT ONE POLLING STATION, A </p><p>WELL-DRESSED MAN CAME UP TO US, IDENTIFIED HIMSELF IN A FURTIVE </p><p>WHISPER AS AN MDC OFFICIAL, AND SAID HE HAD BEEN SENT FROM HARARE </p><p>TO OBSERVE THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) GIVEN THE TENSE PRE-ELECTION ATMOSPHERE AND THE ELECTION- </p><p>DAY IRREGULARITIES NOTED ABOVE, IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT SOME </p><p>RESIDENTS FELT COMFORTABLE ABOUT VOTING AND THUS STAYED AWAY FROM </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1675 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02666  03 OF 03  101553Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------1CFF9E  101553Z /38 </p><p>P 101538Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9679 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BULAWAYO MAYORAL VOTE AND MAKONI WEST BY-ELECTION MARRED </p><p>BY IRREGULARITIES </p><p> </p><p>THE POLLS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THE FINAL RESULT TO BE </p><p>ANNOUNCED UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY ON SEPTEMBER 10 OR SOMETIME ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN MAKONI WEST, WE OBSERVED WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN </p><p>EMERGING STRATEGY ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THE </p><p>ABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO OBSERVE ALL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>TOLD DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THAT THEY DO NOT REQUIRE ACCREDITATION TO </p><p>OBSERVE BY-ELECTIONS, BUT, DESPITE NUMEROUS REQUESTS, HAS REFUSED </p><p>TO PROVIDE WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION TO THAT EFFECT, WHICH CAN BE USED </p><p>OUTSIDE OF HARARE AND OTHER URBANIZED AREAS.  IN MAKONI WEST, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDING OFFICERS AT EACH POLLING STATION REFUSED </p><p>EVEN TO SPEAK TO US WITHOUT "OFFICIAL" GOZ ACCREDITATION AND, IN </p><p>SOME CASES, REFUSED TO ALLOW CONTACT BETWEEN US AND THE PARTY </p><p>POLLING AGENTS.  IN PAST BY-ELECTIONS, POLICE OFFICERS OFTEN WERE </p><p>WILLING TO SHARE WITH US THEIR ASSESSMENTS OF THE DAY\'S VOTING </p><p>BUT, THIS TIME, THE POLICE AT EACH POLLING STATION SIMPLY REFERRED </p><p>US TO THE PRESIDING OFFICER.  MOST OF THE LOCAL OFFICIALS SEEMED </p><p>TO HAVE A CLEAR SET OF INSTRUCTIONS.  OUR SENSE IS THAT WE MAY </p><p>HAVE A FUTURE PROBLEM WHEREIN THE RELEVANT GOZ AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>HARARE CONTINUE TO TELL US WE DO NOT NEED ACCREDITATION, WHILE </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE INSTRUCTED NOT TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH US </p><p>UNLESS WE ARE ACCREDITED, A CLASSIC CATCH-22. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02666  03 OF 03  101553Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
