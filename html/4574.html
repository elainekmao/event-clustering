<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002742 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLOFF KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 C/D. </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) Summary.  The Zimbabwe ruling party,s annual </p><p>conference has been scheduled for December 11-15 in Chinhoyi. </p><p> No major changes in the ZANU-PF leadership or discussion of </p><p>a Mugabe succession are expected to be announced, although </p><p>the persistent rumor that ailing Vice President Simon Muzenda </p><p>will resign continues to make the rounds.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>ANNUAL CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Fred Shava, ZANU-PF,s Director of Administration, </p><p>confirmed to poloff on December 2 that ZANU-PF,s annual </p><p>conference will be held in Chinhoyi on December 11-15. </p><p>Unlike the ZANU-PF congress held every five years, half the </p><p>party,s 6,000 delegates will attend this year,s conference. </p><p>  Harare diplomats will be invited to attend the opening </p><p>ceremony and embassies should receive their invitations </p><p>shortly, the director noted.  Shava described the conference </p><p>as the party,s annual &management review,8 which is </p><p>different from the 5-year congress.  The 5-year congress is </p><p>tasked with electing the party,s 280 member Central </p><p>Committee, whereas according to the ZANU-PF constitution, no </p><p>leadership changes can be made at a conference.  The next </p><p>5-year congress will be in 2006.  (NOTE: Poloff had been </p><p>trying to meet with Shava for 3 months but was always put </p><p>off.  Shava expressed a desire to meet again in February, </p><p>after the December conference and administrative meetings in </p><p>January.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) This year,s agenda will focus on land reform, price </p><p>controls, international relations, and the economy, according </p><p>to Shava.  Shava seemed particularly interested in the state </p><p>of the economy and repairing international relations.  He </p><p>also said there would not be a discussion of succession--a </p><p>stance seconded by party spokesman, Nathan Shamuyarira, in an </p><p>article in the December 1 edition of the GOZ-controlled </p><p>Sunday Mail.  (NOTE: On November 19, Poloff met with party </p><p>deputy commissar Sikhanyiso Ndlovu who refused to discuss </p><p>party issues, deferring all questions to the Secretary for </p><p>External Affairs, Didymus Mutasa, with whom Poloff has been </p><p>unable to meet. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>4.  (C) This year,s ZANU-PF conference promises nothing new. </p><p> Both the party Director of Administration and the Spokesman </p><p>have dashed any hopes of a party-wide discussion of </p><p>succession by saying there will be no discussion of the issue </p><p>until 2006--two years before the next presidential election </p><p>and one year after the next parliamentary elections.  We </p><p>expect no other major internal changes, although the rumor </p><p>that VP Muzenda will step down because of his failing </p><p>health--reportedly AIDS relate--continues to circulate.  The </p><p>conference will most likely serve as a venue to defend the </p><p>party,s choices that have crippled the economy and </p><p>engendered a grave political crisis.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
