IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY IS CRANKING </p><p>ITS VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION MACHINE INTO HIGH GEAR FOR </p><p>THE BIKITA WEST BY-ELECTION NOW SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY </p><p>13-14, 2001.  THE BY-ELECTION IS BEING HELD TO REPLACE </p><p>THE MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT WHO DIED OF AN ILLNESS IN </p><p>NOVEMBER.  YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER AND NEW ZANU-PF </p><p>COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI HAS DEPLOYED BUSLOADS OF ZANU-PF </p><p>YOUTH AND WAR VETERANS TO BIKITA WEST, IN MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE, TO HARASS OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, STEAL VOTER </p><p>IDENTIFICATION CARDS, AND CLOSE OFF THE AREA TO MDC </p><p>RALLIES, ACCORDING TO AN MDC ADVISOR IN BIKITA WEST. </p><p>FIFTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN CLASHES BETWEEN MDC AND </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS ON DECEMBER 17.  THE MDC CANDIDATE </p><p>HAS ALREADY GONE INTO HIDING.  GIVEN THE MDC\'S NARROW </p><p>MARGIN OF VICTORY IN JUNE, IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT ZANU- </p><p>PF WILL BE ABLE TO INTIMIDATE ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY INTO </p><p>VOTING FOR ITS CANDIDATE AND BOOST ITS MAJORITY IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON DECEMBER 19, POLOFF MET ALEX MUPA, AN MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07164  01 OF 02  201308Z </p><p>MEMBER AND ADVISOR TO MDC CANDIDATE FOR PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>BIKITA WEST, BONIFACE PAKAI.  MUPA REPORTED THAT AFTER </p><p>ZANU-PF CONCLUDED ITS CONGRESS ON DECEMBER 16, YOUTH </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MINISTER AND NEW RULING PARTY COMMISSAR </p><p>BORDER GEZI DEPLOYED FIVE BUSLOADS AND 14 TRUCKLOADS OF </p><p>ZANU-PF YOUTH AND WAR VETERANS TO NYIKA GROWTH POINT IN </p><p>BIKITA WEST.  (NOTE: GEZI, JUST ELEVATED TO THE </p><p>POLITBURO, LED ZANU-PF\'S INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IN JUNE </p><p>IN MASHONALAND WEST, WHERE HE WAS GOVERNOR.  END NOTE.) </p><p>THE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY MAINTAINS A YOUTH </p><p>TRAINING FACILITY IN BIKITA, SO THE PARTY CAN EASILY PUT </p><p>UP HUNDREDS OF SUPPORTERS IN THE CONSTITUENCY, MUPA </p><p>CLAIMED.  TWO OF THE TRUCKS USED IN THE OPERATION WERE </p><p>ARMY VEHICLES, HE ADDED.  CHIKOMBA MP AND WAR VETERANS </p><p>LEADER CHENJERAI HUNZVI AND SELF-STYLED FARM OCCUPATIONS </p><p>LEADER JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA HAVE ALSO APPEARED IN BIKITA </p><p>WEST TO ORGANIZE THE INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN.  THE </p><p>DECEMBER 19 "THE DAILY NEWS" REPORTED THAT, SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER THE ZANU-PF OPERATIVES DESCENDED ON BIKITA WEST ON </p><p>DECEMBER 17, CLASHES ERUPTED WITH MDC SUPPORTERS, AND 50 </p><p>PEOPLE WERE INJURED.  THE "NEWS" REPORTED THAT A YOUTH </p><p>WEARING AN MDC T-SHIRT WAS SEVERELY BEATEN, AND MUPA </p><p>CLAIMED HE LATER DIED FROM HIS INJURIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE ZANU-PF "TASK FORCE" HAS WASTED NO TIME IN </p><p>INTIMIDATING THE RESIDENTS OF BIKITA WEST, ACCORDING TO </p><p>MUPA.  WAR VETERANS ARE BEATING UP SUSPECTED MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS, OCCUPYING COMMERCIAL FARMS AND THE BIKITA </p><p>MINERALS PLANT, AND FORCING PEOPLE TO SURRENDER THEIR </p><p>NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION CARDS SO THEY CANNOT VOTE IN </p><p>JANUARY.  WOMEN ARE BEING FORCED TO SCRUB PAINTED MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07164  01 OF 02  201308Z </p><p>MARKINGS OFF OF ASPHALT ROADWAYS, MUPA CONTINUED.  FARM </p><p>INVASIONS, WHICH BEGAN IN THE AREA LAST FEBRUARY, ARE </p><p>INTENSIFYING: WAR VETS ARE FORCIBLY REMOVING FARM </p><p>WORKERS FROM COMMERCIAL FARMS AND TRANSPORTING THEM TO </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMS, AT LEAST THREE PROMINENT LOCAL </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND CATTLE RANCHERS HAVE FLED THE </p><p>AREA, AND WORK ON THE FARMS HAS HALTED.  ZANU-PF CADRES </p><p>ARE ALSO THREATENING LOCAL CHIEFS AND SUB-CHIEFS, SAYING </p><p>THAT IF THEY DO NOT MAKE THEIR SUBJECTS VOTE FOR ZANU- </p><p>PF, THE RULING PARTY WILL TAKE AWAY THEIR GOVERNMENT </p><p>SALARIES AND POWERS OF LAND APPORTIONMENT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE MDC ADVISOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC, FOR ITS PART, IS BEING FORCED TO HALT </p><p>ITS CAMPAIGN AND REFOCUS ON CIVIC EDUCATION, MUPA </p><p>REPORTED.  THE WAR VETERANS HAVE THREATENED TO ABDUCT </p><p>THE MDC CANDIDATE, BONIFACE PAKAI, AND HE HAS GONE INTO </p><p>HIDING ALONG WITH HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER.  THE WIVES OF </p><p>OTHER LOCAL MDC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE </p><p>AREA FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY, MUPA CONTINUED.  SINCE OPEN </p><p>CAMPAIGNING IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE, THE MDC IS REFOCUSING </p><p>ITS EFFORTS ON CIVIC EDUCATION.  THEY ARE COUNSELING </p><p>BIKITA WEST RESIDENTS ON THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO </p><p>VOTE, THE NEED TO REGISTER TO VOTE, AND THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF HOLDING ON TO THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS.

(C) MUPA WENT ON TO CHARACTERIZE THE BIKITA WEST </p><p>VIOLENCE AS A LARGER CONFLICT BETWEEN THE KARANGA AND </p><p>ZEZURU SUBCLANS OF THE SHONA ETHNIC GROUP.  THE ZEZURU, </p><p>WHO DOMINATE THE GOVERNMENT, ARE BENT ON BREAKING UP A </p><p>PERCEIVED ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE KARANGA OF MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE AND THE NDEBELE, WHO PREDOMINATE IN </p><p>MATABELELAND.  MUPA STATED THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE </p><p>CAMPAIGN IN BIKITA WEST IS LINKED TO THE REMOVAL OF </p><p>MASVINGO "SUPREMO" EDDISON ZVOBGO FROM THE ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO.  MASVINGO, AND THE KARANGA OF BIKITA WEST, </p><p>ARE BEING PUNISHED FOR ZVOBGO\'S DEFIANCE OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE.  MUPA CLAIMED THAT ZANU-PF IS NO LONGER A </p><p>NATIONAL PARTY, BUT PURELY AN INSTRUMENT OF THE ZEZURU </p><p>SUBCLAN. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07164  02 OF 02  201309Z </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE SITUATION </p><p>IN BIKITA WEST FIRST-HAND, WE FIND MUPA\'S ACCOUNT </p><p>CREDIBLE.  BIKITA IS REMOTE AND NOT SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY </p><p>BY THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, DIPLOMATIC CORPS, OR FOREIGN </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENTAL OBSERVERS.  THUS, WE INFER THE RULING </p><p>PARTY FEELS LESS CONSTRAINED IN HOW IT APPLIES THE </p><p>MAILED FIST TO THIS CONSTITUENCY THAT VOTED FOR THE MDC. </p><p>ZANU-PF IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS TO PREVENT THE MDC </p><p>FROM MOBILIZING POPULAR SUPPORT AND TO WHITTLE AWAY AT </p><p>ITS SIZABLE MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT.  THE MDC WON BIKITA </p><p>WEST IN THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS BY FEWER THAN </p><p>300 VOTES, AND ZANU-PF APPARENTLY BELIEVES IT CAN </p><p>RECAPTURE THE SEAT WITH OVERWHELMING INTIMIDATION.  IT </p><p>SAW THAT ITS VIOLENT TACTICS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THE </p><p>NOVEMBER MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION, AND IT WILL STICK </p><p>WITH ITS PROVEN STRATEGY.  POPULAR DISSATISFACTION WITH </p><p>ZANU-PF IS SO GREAT THAT THE PARTY SEES NO OTHER WAY TO </p><p>STAY IN POWER.  ANY ZANU-PF LOSSES AT THIS POINT WOULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE MORE ZIMBABWEANS TO VOTE FOR THE OPPOSITION IN </p><p>THE FUTURE.  THE RULING PARTY IS UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY </p><p>CHANCES.  GIVEN THE OPPOSITION\'S INABILITY TO </p><p>EFFECTIVELY CAMPAIGN IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THE POPULAR </p><p>FEAR OF MORE VIOLENCE AND RETRIBUTION, THE MDC IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO RETAIN ITS SEAT IN BIKITA WEST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: WE HAVE HEARD THAT URBAN </p><p>DWELLERS VISITING FAMILY IN BIKITA FOR THE HOLIDAYS MAY </p><p>TRY TO PLAY A ROLE IN LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD.  THERE </p><p>ARE REPORTS THAT URBAN MDC SUPPORTERS MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE EXTENDED HOLIDAY PERIOD TO VISIT BIKITA AND BOTH </p><p>BOLSTER THE RESOLVE OF BIKITA VOTERS AND "DEAL WITH" THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07164  02 OF 02  201309Z </p><p>ZANU-PF-DEPLOYED YOUTH AND WAR VETERANS.  IF TRUE, THIS </p><p>COULD WELL RESULT IN EVEN MORE VIOLENCE THAN WAS </p><p>EXPERIENCED IN THE RECENT MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION. </p><p>ALSO, IT COULD SIGNAL A NEW KIND OF TAKE-THE-BULL-BY- </p><p>THE-HORNS "MASS ACTION" BY MDC SUPPORTERS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
