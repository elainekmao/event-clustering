<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CONVERSATION WITH MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)   MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube told the </p><p>Ambassador on November 15 that the treason case against him </p><p>and his party compatriots has no legal merit, but it could be </p><p>assigned to a judge who is inclined to give more weight to </p><p>political considerations.  He described growing resentment </p><p>within the MDC about South Africa\'s stand on Zimbabwe and </p><p>said the party is likely to refocus its lobbying efforts </p><p>within SADC away from South Africa toward Mozambique, Malawi, </p><p>Botswana, and Mauritius.  The MDC likely will contest the </p><p>Kuwadzana parliamentary by-election to replace former MDC </p><p>spokesman Learnmore Jongwe but will make a broader policy </p><p>decision after that on whether to continue to participate in </p><p>elections.  Ncube claimed not to know why the independent </p><p>autopsy results on Jongwe had not yet been made available but </p><p>did not dismiss the possibility of suicide.  He urged the USG </p><p>to impose an asset freeze with haste on Zimbabwe\'s primary </p><p>decision-makers and said expulsion of their children from the </p><p>United States would have an effect.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Treason trial </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In a November 15 conversation with the Ambassador </p><p>and polchief, MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube noted that </p><p>the treason trial in which he, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>and MDC MP Renson Gasela are facing charges of plotting the </p><p>assassination of Robert Mugabe had been postponed from </p><p>November to February 2003.  He said the MDC had originally </p><p>sought a shorter delay because the Government has refused to </p><p>provide the defense with a copy of the incriminating </p><p>videotape which is the state\'s key piece of evidence.  Ncube </p><p>claimed that none of the charges would be sustainable in an </p><p>independent court, but he expressed worry that the case could </p><p>be assigned to a judge who would render a decision based on </p><p>political calculations, not legal merits. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On a separate legal development, Ncube was asked to </p><p>comment on the November 14 Supreme Court decision denying the </p><p>MDC a copy of the electronic version of the voters roll used </p><p>in the March presidential election.  (Note:  The GOZ has </p><p>refused to provide the MDC with either hard copies or </p><p>electronic versions of the voters roll, a thorough analysis </p><p>of which will be crucial to the opposition party\'s pending </p><p>legal challenge of the presidential election results.  End </p><p>Note.)  Ncube said the presiding Supreme Court justices had </p><p>used a minor legal technicality to deny the MDC\'s request for </p><p>the electronic version of the roll.  His party would now try </p><p>to obtain hard copies, but Ncube pointed out that scanning </p><p>the information from those into a computer program capable of </p><p>performing analysis would be a daunting, time-consuming task. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>South Africa </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ncube said many members of the MDC\'s national </p><p>executive felt increasing resentment about South Africa\'s </p><p>refusal to engage more actively in the search for a lasting </p><p>solution of Zimbabwe\'s political crisis.  He mentioned a </p><p>recent meeting in Harare with visiting Mbeki advisers who </p><p>said they were well-briefed on the political situation and </p><p>preferred to focus exclusively on the economic crisis. </p><p>According to Ncube, they clearly conveyed the impression that </p><p>they were looking at ways in which South Africa could help </p><p>assuage the economic situation, but were less interested in </p><p>addressing questions of governance.  He said that South </p><p>Africa\'s passivity raised questions in the MDC about their </p><p>appropriateness in any future mediation.  The MDC was </p><p>considering shifting its lobbying efforts within SADC away </p><p>from South Africa and toward countries such as Malawi, </p><p>Mozambique, Botswana, and Mauritius, which have demonstrated </p><p>a greater willingness to express concern about developments </p><p>in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Contesting elections </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ncube acknowledged that the MDC national executive </p><p>was currently considering whether to boycott future </p><p>elections, given that ZANU-PF has perfected the art of </p><p>"winning" them by utilizing violence, intimidation, food, and </p><p>fraud.  The party\'s top six leaders first gave serious </p><p>consideration to this possibility after the ruling party\'s </p><p>"victory" in the Insiza parliamentary by-election in late </p><p>October.  According to Ncube, they split right down the </p><p>middle, with Tsvangirai, Deputy Secretary-General Gift </p><p>Chimanikire, and national chairman Isaac Matongo favoring a </p><p>boycott, while Ncube, Vice-President Gibson Sibanda, and </p><p>treasurer Fletcher Dulini-Ncube opposing it.  Ncube </p><p>emphasized that it would be difficult to convince the MDC\'s </p><p>supporters to continue fighting for positive change if the </p><p>party itself decided simply to concede elections.  He thought </p><p>the national executive would decide to contest the upcoming </p><p>(but not yet scheduled) Kuwadzana by-election to replace </p><p>former party spokesman Learnmore Jongwe -- since at leat six </p><p>of its members were interested in contesting the seat.  He </p><p>thought the party would then make a broader policy decision </p><p>on contesting elections after that. </p><p> </p><p>Jongwe autopsy results </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Polchief noted the government pathologist\'s </p><p>conclusion that Learnmore Jongwe had died of chloroquine </p><p>poisoning and asked why the results of the second, </p><p>independent autopsy commissioned by the MDC had not yet been </p><p>announced.  Ncube replied that he was unsure why the South </p><p>African pathologist retained by the party had not yet </p><p>provided his findings.  He did not rule out that Jongwe may </p><p>have committed suicide, saying that the former MDC </p><p>spokesman\'s lawyer had painted a bleak picture of his legal </p><p>options about a week-and-a-half before his death, in which he </p><p>had apparently stressed the likelihood of Jongwe\'s facing the </p><p>death penalty.  Those who visited Jongwe soon after this </p><p>meeting found him to be particularly morose.  At about the </p><p>same time, according to Ncube, Jongwe had asked at least one </p><p>friend to bring him chloroquine, claiming to be suffering </p><p>from malaria and saying that the prison authorities had </p><p>refused to provide the appropriate medication. </p><p> </p><p>Food </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ncube expressed concern about politicization of </p><p>international food assistance, reporting that he had received </p><p>numerous complaints that ZANU-PF functionaries at the local </p><p>level are involved in selection of beneficiaries.  He added </p><p>that he had received the most complaints about World Vision\'s </p><p>food distribution efforts, and said the NGO\'s national </p><p>director had refused to meet with the MDC\'s shadow </p><p>agriculture minister.  Noting that he had observed many food </p><p>distribution events personally, the Ambassador explained that </p><p>beneficiaries are selected in a rigorous, transparent process </p><p>in which the entire community is involved.  Local authorities </p><p>beholden to the ruling party do not have veto power, he said. </p><p> The Ambassador encouraged the MDC to establish a liaison </p><p>office whose objective would be to become familiar with WFP\'s </p><p>beneficiary selection process and to vet complaints </p><p>thoroughly before passing them on to the UN and us.  He </p><p>expressed his surprise that World Vision\'s director, whom he </p><p>knew well, had refused to meet with MDC officials, but he </p><p>undertook to encourage her to do so. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Pressure </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The MDC\'s Secretary-General thought the targeted </p><p>sanctions imposed by the U.S. to date had been effective in </p><p>turning up the heat on Zimbabwe\'s primary decision-makers. </p><p>He expressed concern, however, that an asset freeze had not </p><p>yet been implemented and believed the absence of follow-up </p><p>sanctions had diminished pressure for a solution.  Ncube also </p><p>encouraged the USG to expel the children of those on our </p><p>sanctions list, insisting that that move would make ruling </p><p>party insiders think long and hard before continuing with </p><p>their disastrous policies. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  One of the MDC\'s leading intellectuals, Ncube did </p><p>not evince much hope that Zimbabwe\'s political crisis would </p><p>be resolved in the short term, at least not peacefully.  The </p><p>MDC has invested significant time and resources during the </p><p>past two years in trying to convince South Africa to engage </p><p>more actively in addressing Zimbabwe\'s political crisis. </p><p>Ncube\'s remarks suggest a growing feeling among the party </p><p>leadership that that effort has failed, and that it is a </p><p>waste of time to expect South Africa to play the role of fair </p><p>broker.  We believe contesting the by-election in Kuwadzana, </p><p>a high-density suburb in Harare, is the better route. </p><p>Although ZANU-PF will employ its usual comprehensive array of </p><p>tactics to win the seat in this MDC stronghold, the people of </p><p>Kuwadzana will not be as vulnerable to violence and food </p><p>manipulation as rural residents, and the ruling party\'s abuse </p><p>of the electoral process will be much more visible to outside </p><p>observers.  We plan to send embassy officers regularly to the </p><p>constituency, beginning several weeks before the election, </p><p>and we will encourage other diplomatic missions to do the </p><p>same. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
