<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 1258: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ECON, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Survey of Jordan\'s Wireless Internet </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 85946 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  As per instructions REFTEL, we consulted with </p><p>Jordanian telecom regulatory officials to respond to </p><p>survey questions regarding Wi-Fi regulations in Jordan. </p><p>Follow-up questions can be directed to Greg Garramone, </p><p>Econ Section (GarramoneGG@state.gov).  The responses </p><p>begin para. 2. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Jordan has allocated unlicensed radio-frequency </p><p>spectrum for use by Wi-Fi and similar wireless </p><p>technologies, specifically Spread Spectrum in </p><p>frequency bands (2400 - 2483.5 MHz), (5150-5250 MHz) </p><p>and (5725-5850 MHz.  Currently, Jordan allows only </p><p>indoor use of Wi-Fi or similar wireless technologies </p><p>with maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) </p><p>of 100mw.  According to Telecommunications Regulatory </p><p>Commission (TRC) regulations, devices producing EIRP </p><p>under 10mw need only type approval, usually obtained by </p><p>the vendor.  Sites installing devices producing EIRP in </p><p>excess of 10mw, but less than 100mw, need to obtain a </p><p>usage license in addition to the type approval. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Wi-Fi systems can not be used without a license in </p><p>Jordan.  A type license is required for devices </p><p>producing EIRP under 10mw; additionally, a usage </p><p>license is required for devices producing EIRP over </p><p>10mw but under 100mw. </p><p> </p><p>The following requirements must be submitted with the </p><p>application for a usage license: </p><p> </p><p>A. A certificate confirming that the system conforms to </p><p>European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) </p><p>standards EN 300 328, EN 300 440, or EN 300 836, or in </p><p>accordance with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) </p><p>Rules Part 15.247 or 15.247(g) or 15.407. </p><p>B. Submit a test report that complies with all TRC </p><p>accredited standards. </p><p>C. Colored pictures for the equipment from all sides, </p><p>showing the brand, model and type. </p><p>D. A complete test report describing the equipment used </p><p>to conduct the test. </p><p>E. Written confirmation by the testing laboratory, </p><p>confirming that the equipment is in accordance with </p><p>European safety requirements regarding the emission of </p><p>radial power. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Wi-Fi can be used in licensed commercial outlets, </p><p>such as Internet cafes, as long as the location abides </p><p>by the regulations governing the use of Wi-Fi. </p><p> </p><p>4.  There are currently no known commercial Wi-Fi </p><p>networks that provide service to the public currently </p><p>operating in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to our sources at the Ministry of </p><p>Information and Communications Technology, Wi-Fi is </p><p>currently in use at few five star hotels for guest and </p><p>staff use.  Global One, a subsidiary of Jordan Telecom, </p><p>told us that their offices utilize Wi-Fi, and that </p><p>there are plans to outfit the Queen Alia International </p><p>Airport passenger halls with Wi-Fi for use by </p><p>travelers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Wi-Fi is currently not in use in rural areas in </p><p>Jordan.  MoICT sources told us that plans to connect </p><p>all schools and universities throughout Jordan to the </p><p>Internet are based on fiber optics and wired LAN\'s and </p><p>WAN\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  There are currently no longer distance (beyond 100 </p><p>meters outdoors) Wi-Fi networks in use in-country as Wi- </p><p>Fi usage is limited to indoor facilities for the time </p><p>being. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The number of Wi-Fi units sold in Jordan is </p><p>currently not available, but indications are that it is </p><p>low compared to wired network devices. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Further information regarding Wi-Fi use and </p><p>licensing is available at the TRC website </p><p>www.trc.gov.jo. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
