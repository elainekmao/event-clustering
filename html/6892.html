<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0088 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TU, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>MARCH 27, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 27, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal: The US applied to Turkey for permission </p><p>to use Incirlik, Batman, and Malatya air bases </p><p>for striking Iraq as it faced difficulty in </p><p>advancing to Baghdad from the south. The Turkish </p><p>government responded that Incirlik AB could be </p><p>used for transporting wounded soldiers and </p><p>damaged vehicles, but a motion was required for </p><p>using new bases and for purposes other than </p><p>specified above. It is also reported that </p><p>reciprocal suspicion concerning goals in Northern </p><p>Iraq have not been totally eliminated. While </p><p>Turkish diplomatic sources complain about lack of </p><p>knowledge about "what the US has exactly promised </p><p>to the Kurds", the US suspects that "Turkey bears </p><p>undeclared intentions about Northern Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal/Sabah/Tercuman: In order not to </p><p>experience the difficulty it has been facing in </p><p>the south in the war on Iraq, the US wants to </p><p>include Turkey in the Military and Humanitarian </p><p>Relief Coordination Center to be established in </p><p>Salahaddin and thus form an air bridge that would </p><p>connect Northern Iraq to the Mediterranean. The </p><p>US reported its expectations from Turkey within </p><p>the framework of this plan to Ankara recently. As </p><p>it was disclosed by the US Commander in </p><p>Selahaddin, Lt. Gen. Henry Osman, establishment </p><p>of a liaison office in Silopi has been requested. </p><p>The US request\'s conformity with the Turkish </p><p>Constitution and laws is being examined, and a </p><p>meeting between the US, Turkey, and Northern </p><p>Iraqi Groups is being considered. The sides are </p><p>in total agreement that Turkey should supply all </p><p>sorts of needs of the refugees who would flow to </p><p>the Turkish border, but the needs of the Northern </p><p>Iraqis who would remain in their houses, </p><p>including food, energy, medicine, infrastructure </p><p>and security should be provided by the US. It is </p><p>believed that the US units hundreds of kilometers </p><p>away from their nearest headquarters in Iraq </p><p>could not fulfill this task without cooperation </p><p>of Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal/Milliyet: Two days after they evacuated </p><p>their base in Nusaybin, the Americans resumed </p><p>construction work at the factories they rented in </p><p>the Organized Industrial Zone on Kiziltepe-Mardin </p><p>highway. The US soldiers surrounded the factories </p><p>with barbed wire, and sand bags. The US also </p><p>rented land behind a yarn factory for </p><p>constructing a helicopter pad, and carried </p><p>logistical material in trucks. Reporters were not </p><p>allowed to the site which had been turned into a </p><p>logistical support center. The soldiers </p><p>positioned on the roofs of the factories remain </p><p>on guard round the clock and control the area </p><p>with binoculars. Tens of armored vehicles, </p><p>antiaircraft batteries, medical equipment, and </p><p>radio equipment are deployed on the base. </p><p>Radikal: In addition to physical measures taken </p><p>in Cukurca of Hakkari and Silopi of Sirnak for </p><p>the likely flow of refugees to the Turkish </p><p>border, the Health Ministry announced it would </p><p>send 30 thousand units of protective shots, and </p><p>dressing kits in addition to the medical supply </p><p>they would dispatch to Van, Hakkari, Sirnak, and </p><p>Mardin provinces. The officials said the refugees </p><p>to be admitted to Turkey would be given </p><p>protective shots, and dressing kits would be kept </p><p>in hospitals. 104 health clerks temporarily </p><p>assigned to the Southeast from Istanbul were </p><p>dispatched to the region by military aircraft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal/Hurriyet/Milliyet: The US and Dutch </p><p>soldiers deployed at Batman AB will be fined on </p><p>grounds of contaminating the environment. It has </p><p>been determined that the soldiers who have been </p><p>staying on the base for 25 days now have been </p><p>dumping their waste into Batman River that flows </p><p>by the base. Batman Directorate of Environment </p><p>has the authority to give a fine ranging from </p><p>approximately $-6,000.- to $-56,000.- per day. </p><p>Hurriyet/Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Dunya/Mil li </p><p>Gazete/Sabah/Bolge/Tercuman: At a press </p><p>conference in Diyarbakir yesterday, the head of </p><p>TGS, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, gave important messages to </p><p>the domestic and international public about how </p><p>the Turkish Armed Forces viewed the Iraq war. </p><p>Gen. Ozkok said only under the following three </p><p>conditions the Turkish army would penetrate into </p><p>Northern Iraq. </p><p>1. There are components of the Turkish Army </p><p>in Northern Iraq. In case of an attack at </p><p>these forces of the Turkish army. </p><p>2. Eruption of a large flow of migration, </p><p>depending on the developments in the war. </p><p>3. Eruption of instability due to clashes </p><p>that might brake out between armed forces </p><p>in the region, or attacks at civilians. </p><p>Gen. Ozkok said if they reached the conclusion </p><p>that the  existent forces could not cope with </p><p>threats and dangers </p><p>that might erupt, a decision for the Turkish </p><p>Armed Forces to send additional forces to Iraq </p><p>could be made, and added they would not enter </p><p>Northern Iraq to fight or occupy if developments </p><p>reached to that point, and had no intention of </p><p>forming permanent buffer zones there. The general </p><p>said suspicious, unjust and sometimes humiliating </p><p>statements by some friends and allies effected </p><p>the Turkish people deeply, and he had difficulty </p><p>in understanding the attitude of the ones talking </p><p>about the oversea threat to themselves not </p><p>finding Turkey\'s claims of the same threat right </p><p>beyond its borders. Gen. Ozkok said they would </p><p>provide support to prevent any instability from </p><p>happening in Northern Iraq, had no secret </p><p>objectives or hostility against anybody, and </p><p>would not enter into hot clashes with anybody </p><p>except in self-defense circumstances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evrensel: As a result of unknown armed clashes </p><p>between village guards on duty in rural Karamese </p><p>village of Sason township, Batman province, </p><p>Suleyman Tas, a village guard from Tasyuva </p><p>village was killed. A large scale investigation </p><p>is underway, officials said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evrensel: With the cooperation of the Civil </p><p>Defense Office in Diyarbakir, a Norwegian team </p><p>conducted drills on how people should protect </p><p>themselves from NBC weapons. The Deputy Governor, </p><p>Nusret Miroglu, who observed the drills said hot </p><p>developments were taking place nearby and such a </p><p>drill was required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evrensel: The Regional Administrative Court of </p><p>Gaziantep decided to stop implementation of a </p><p>decision by Harran University in favor of seven </p><p>students who were expelled from the schoolon the </p><p>grounds of filing a petition with the university </p><p>for teaching of Kurdish as an elective class at </p><p>university. The students will be able to attend </p><p>school again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal/Turkiye: The Court of Cassation\'s Chief </p><p>Public Prosecutor, Sabih Kanadoglu, charged DEHAP </p><p>provincial chairmen in Hakkari, Gaziantep, </p><p>Kahramanmaras, and Kars of "assisting and </p><p>harboring the separatist terrorist organization" </p><p>and demanded in writing from DEHAP to terminate 7 </p><p>of its administrators in a month. In case DEHAP </p><p>does not terminate its provincial representatives </p><p>in provinces mentioned above, Kanadoglu will be </p><p>able to apply to the Constitutional Court to give </p><p>a reprimand to DEHAP, and sue DEHAP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete: 34 mayors from HADEP, </p><p>closed down by Constitutional Court, joined DEHAP </p><p>and transferred their staff to the same party </p><p>yesterday. Former HADEP mayors and supporters </p><p>will take positions in the administration in </p><p>DEHAP after its national convention in May. In </p><p>his address to the new DEHAP mayors, DEHAP\'s </p><p>Chair, Ahmet Turan Demir criticized the US-led </p><p>war on Iraq and AKP\'s attitude toward the war. </p><p>The mayors are getting ready to call on the </p><p>President, Prime Minister, and the Turkish </p><p>National Assembly\'s Spokesman to demand a general </p><p>amnesty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye: According to the Hakkari governor\'s </p><p>office 6 kilos of heroin was seized in a car a </p><p>three persons involved in the trafficking were </p><p>ordered held by the court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye: Based on a tip, the police in Mersin </p><p>seized many historical items, and three persons </p><p>involved in smuggling the items were imprisoned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evrensel: KESK --Public Employees Unions </p><p>Confederation--, DISK -Revolutionary Workers </p><p>Unions Confederation, TTB -Turkish Chamber of </p><p>Doctors--, and TMMO --Turkish Architects and </p><p>Engineers Chamber- holding a meeting at the </p><p>Chamber of Doctors in Adana called out to the </p><p>people to exercise the right they derive from </p><p>production to stop working on March 27.
