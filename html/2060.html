<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 003355 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, BC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MANY BATSWANA SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS ABOUT U.S. </p><p>STRIKES </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  ENERGETIC OUTREACH EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND MISSION STAFF REVEAL THAT INITIAL </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR THE U.S. POST-SEPTEMBER 11 HAS ERODED WITH </p><p>RECENT AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  BATSWANA </p><p>QUESTION U.S. FOREIGN POLICIES; COMPARE THE ASCETIC </p><p>IMAGE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN WITH THE ARRAY OF TECHNICAL </p><p>WEAPONS BEING AIMED AT HIM; AND TALLY THE CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES OF STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.   THEY ASK </p><p>FOR HARD PROOF OF BIN LADEN\'S GUILT; THEY FEAR THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORLD OF A HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION </p><p>WITH TERROR.  ULTIMATELY HOWEVER, THEY VIEW SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 - AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL - AS SOMEONE ELSE\'S </p><p>PROBLEM, NOT THEIRS.  OUR SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO WIN GOB </p><p>SUPPORT COME IN THE FACE OF SOME LOCAL MEDIA WHICH </p><p>PRESS THE GOB TO REMAIN NEUTRAL.  OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>LOCAL EDITORS, MUSLIM OFFICIALS, BUSINESS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, AND KEY OPINION MAKERS HAVE SLOWED, BUT </p><p>NOT STOPPED, THIS TREND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S 10/9 MEETING WITH THREE MEDIA </p><p>EDITORS WAS ILLUSTRATIVE OF MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS </p><p>HELD BY MISSION STAFF.  THE THREE VOLUNTEERED THAT THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS WERE EVIL, AND IN NO WAY </p><p>JUSTIFIED.  THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE WAVE OF SYMPATHY AND </p><p>RESPECT FOR THE USG WHICH BEGAN TO DIMINISH AS IT </p><p>BECAME APPARENT THE USG WOULD RESPOND WITH SIGNIFICANT </p><p>FORCE.  THE EDITORS WERE NOT CONVINCED UBL WAS GUILTY, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THEY CONCEDED HE LIKELY WAS, AND SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE USG SHOULD WORK HARDER TO MAKES ITS PUBLIC </p><p>CASE.   OVERALL THE EDITORS FELT BATSWANA REACTION TO </p><p>THE AIRSTRIKES WAS MIXED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE EDITORS ALSO QUESTIONED THE MEANS THE USG WAS </p><p>USING TO TRY AND APPREHEND UBL.  MEDIA DEPICTED UBL AS </p><p>AN ASCETIC (ONE EDITOR SAID "A SAINT") WHO HAD </p><p>RENOUNCED AN OSTENTATIOUS LIFESTYLE TO FIGHT WARS OF </p><p>LIBERATION.  HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED IN ROBES IN THE </p><p>DESERT, SOMETIMES WITH HIS FAMILY.  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>THE PUBLIC TO IMPUTE TO HIM THE CRIMES HE IS CHARGED </p><p>WITH WHEN THEY ARE FACED WITH THESE IMAGES.  OPPOSITE </p><p>THIS SIMPLE FIGURE STOOD THE ARMED MIGHT OF THE USG, </p><p>WITH SMART BOMBS AND HIGH-TECH AIRCRAFT POISED TO </p><p>ATTACK.  THE AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE UBL NETWORK OF </p><p>ASSOCIATES, THE COMMITMENT TO TERROR, THE POSSIBLE </p><p>STOCK MARKET MANIPULATIONS TO STRESS THAT THIS WAS NOT </p><p>A SIMPLE MAN OR ORGANIZATION.  THE EDITORS RETURNED </p><p>REPEATEDLY, HOWEVER, TO THE IDEA THAT THE USG WAS </p><p>TRYING TO APPREHEND AN INDIVIDUAL BY USING </p><p>OVERWHELMING, AND POSSIBLY INDISCRIMINATE, FORCE.  THEY </p><p>HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN THE TALIBAN; THEY DID GIVE A </p><p>GREAT DEAL OF WEIGHT TO CIVILIAN DEATHS CAUSED BY USG </p><p>ATTACKS AND THE REFUGEE FLOWS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>FINALLY, THEY NOTED THAT RESPONSES TO SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>COULD GENERATE A NEW ROUND OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY </p><p>GROUPS NOT EVEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEPTEMBER 11 BUT NOW </p><p>RESPONDING TO ATTACKS ON THEIR COLLEAGUES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRESSED TO OFFER BETTER ALTERNATIVES, SOME </p><p>SUGGESTED RELYING MORE ON THE UN AND A BROADER </p><p>COALITION EFFORT SO THAT IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A US-ONLY </p><p>EFFORT.  ANOTHER SUGGESTED PUBLICIZING A STRONGER CASE </p><p>AGAINST UBL.  ALL CONCURRED THAT THE USG SHOULD </p><p>CONSIDER OTHER, MORE DIRECTED, MEANS PROPORTIONATE TO </p><p>ITS ENDS - JUSTICE AGAINST THE PERPETRATORS OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11.  THEY ALSO SEVERAL TIMES SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. WAS PERCEIVED AS A "BULLY" INTERNATIONALLY, </p><p>AND THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM LOSES GENERAL APPEAL THE </p><p>MORE IT IS VIEWED AS PRIMARILY A U.S. EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>OUTRIGHT DISAGREEMENT WITH THE USG </p><p> </p><p>5.  BOTSWANA MEDIA AND LETTERS TO THE EDITOR HAVE BEEN </p><p>ON BALANCE MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE ABOUT THE US. </p><p>USING LOCAL AUTHORS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL PRESS </p><p>SERVICE PIECES, THE PRIVATE PRESS HAS ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>U.S.\'S UNILATERAL APPROACH TO DIPLOMACY AND ITS MIDDLE </p><p>EAST POLICIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. </p><p>PRESS HAS ALSO REPORTED CONCERN THAT U.S.-LED ATTACKS </p><p>MAY PROMPT RETALIATIONS.  ONE PAPER EXTENSIVELY </p><p>REPORTED ON A TRAVELLING AMERICAN FAMILY\'S BELIEF THAT </p><p>RECENT U.S. ACTIONS WERE IN ERROR; THE PIECE RAN </p><p>IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE AMBASSADOR\'S OP-ED ON WHY </p><p>BOTSWANA SHOULD SUPPORT THE U.S.  LETTERS HAVE ALSO </p><p>CRITICIZED THE GOB FOR CHOOSING TO SIDE WITH THE U.S. </p><p>IN NO CASE, HOWEVER, HAVE MEDIA ADVOCATED ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, ITS CITIZENS OR </p><p>INSTALLATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AMBASSADOR, POL/ECON CHIEF AND OTHERS HAVE </p><p>EXTENSIVELY ENGAGED THE ONLY HUMAN RIGHTS NGO IN </p><p>GABORONE, DITSHWANELO, ON BOTH THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS </p><p>AND THE OCTOBER 8 STRIKES.  ALICE MOGWE, THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>ARGUED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION OF THE </p><p>GUILTY WAS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE MEANS OF RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATROCITIES.  HER ORGANIZATION\'S VIEWS HAVE </p><p>ALSO BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>AND SUPPORT FOR OUR APPROACH </p><p> </p><p>7.  BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN MORE </p><p>SUPPORTIVE.  BUSINESS TRAVELLERS RETURNING TO BOTSWANA </p><p>RECOUNT NEW RESTRICTIONS AT AIRPORTS, AND CLOSE CALLS </p><p>BY FAMILY OR COLLEAGUES, ANECDOTES WHICH BRING THE </p><p>REALITY OF SEPTEMBER 11 CLOSER TO HOME.  AFTER THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S 10/12 SPEECH TO THE ROTARY CLUB, </p><p>PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT TERRORISM </p><p>COULD TAKE PLACE IN BOTSWANA AND THAT THE GLOBAL </p><p>COALITION ON TERRORISM MUST SUCCEED.  THEY WERE ALSO </p><p>CURIOUS TO LEARN WHETHER THE USG WOULD SHIFT SOME OF </p><p>ITS MIDDLE EAST POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS. </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S AND PAO\'S CONTACTS WITH ACADEMICS ALSO </p><p>ENCOUNTER A GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:   PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POST- </p><p>OCTOBER 8 HAS GENERALLY COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>ELITES; WE SUSPECT THERE IS MORE UNSTATED POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT THAN REGISTERS IN THE PRESS.  WE WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO TARGET OUTREACH PROGRAMS AT THAT BROADER BUT LESS- </p><p>DEFINED SPECTRUM OF BATSWANA WHO HARBOR CONTINUED </p><p>DOUBTS ABOUT UBL GUILT, USG RESPONSE AND QUESTION THE </p><p>RELEVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11 TO BOTSWANA. </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
