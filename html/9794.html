<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001944 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KDEM, ASEC, GT, PJUS </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICE CHIEF MANCHAME FIRED; CONSTITUTIONAL COURT </p><p>REJECTS LATEST FRG APPEAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1908 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Responding to accusations that the Police did </p><p>not ensure public order during the protests of July 24-25, </p><p>Government Minister Reyes Calderon fired Police Chief </p><p>Manchame on July 27.  On July 28, the Constitutional Court </p><p>rejected the FRG\'s latest appeal on behalf of Rios Montt. </p><p>The FRG has filed a new appeal before the Constitutional </p><p>Court, while the Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on </p><p>the original appeal to the decision that Rios Montt can be a </p><p>candidate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Accusations that the GOG did not fulfill its </p><p>obligation to ensure public safety during the violent </p><p>protests by the FRG on July 24-25 led the GOG to remove </p><p>Police Chief Raul Manchame on July 27. It remains unclear who </p><p>was responsible for the lack of police action to maintain </p><p>order during the protests, with some sectors blaming </p><p>Manchame, others blaming the Minister of Government and </p><p>others saying the police officers in the street did not </p><p>follow orders. The Minister of Government named Oscar Segura </p><p>Sanchez to replace Manchame on July 28, and promised to </p><p>provide police protection for citizens during future </p><p>protests.  Manchame later gave a press conference in which he </p><p>loyally refused to blame his superiors.  Little is known </p><p>about Segura Sanchez, who has only been named Acting Police </p><p>Chief and who may yet face fallout for last weeks </p><p>disturbances given his role as Chief of Police Operations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On July 28, the Constitutional Court rejected one of </p><p>the FRG\'s petitions to order the Supreme Electoral Tribunal </p><p>to obey the Constitutional Court\'s July 14 decision to </p><p>register (ret.) General Rios Montt as a presidential </p><p>candidate.  The Court again had to draw at random on an </p><p>alternate justice to replace a permanent magistrate who had </p><p>recused himself.  The alternate, as in the previous draw, was </p><p>one of the justices opposed to Rios Montt, giving the Court a </p><p>3-to-2 majority against the FRG\'s motion. The FRG has filed a </p><p>new appeal before the Constitutional Court in the hopes that </p><p>the draw to replace the missing permanent member will this </p><p>time favor the FRG.  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court continues </p><p>to hear the appeal to the Constitutional Court\'s original </p><p>decision to allow Rios Montt to be a candidate.  A decision </p><p>is expected before August 6. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: Rightly or wrongly, former Police Chief </p><p>Manchame was made the scapegoat for the GOG\'s inaction to </p><p>preserve public order during the recent FRG protests.  He was </p><p>the Portillo Government\'s seventh Chief of Police.  We have </p><p>worked well with Manchame during his brief tenure as Police </p><p>Chief, and will begin engaging his successor as soon as he is </p><p>settled in his office. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment continued: Sooner or later the FRG expects </p><p>to draw an alternate member on the Constitutional Court who </p><p>will favor them (as occurred the first time on July 14), and </p><p>secure a ruling which would instruct the Supreme Court to </p><p>reject the appeals currently before it and register Rios </p><p>Montt as a candidate.  With two pro-Rios Montt alternates, </p><p>three anti-Rios Montt alternates and an evenly split sitting </p><p>Court, the law of averages dictates that sooner or later the </p><p>Court could have a pro-Rios Montt majority.  The filing of </p><p>appeals in this case has already set precedents in Guatemalan </p><p>jurisprudence, and any judicial decision will need to have an </p><p>accompanying political decision if it is to be respected by </p><p>all sides. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
