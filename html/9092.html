<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PREL, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  OIL COMPANIES COURT DELTA MILITANTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C/NF) SUMMARY:  With no discernible progress in the three </p><p>month-old Warri crisis, ChevronTexaco (CTX) appears to be </p><p>talking to the armed Ijaw militants who killed scores of </p><p>people when they attacked and razed over 40 Itsekiri villages </p><p>and several oil installations.  According to sources, CTX </p><p>appears to be seeking a modus vivendi with the militants. </p><p>While it may provide a short-term remedy allowing CTX to up </p><p>production, any compromise with the Ijaw militants will only </p><p>enhance their power and status and will whet their appetite </p><p>for more money and control of the local area.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C/NF) In a June 24 meeting with Embassy ECON and Political </p><p>Officers, Ijaw leader Chief Edwin K. Clark stated  that </p><p>ChevronTexaco Manager for Community Relations Awotorafa </p><p>visited him in Port Harcourt.  According to Clark, Awotorafa </p><p>had earlier shown up in Warri (near Clark\'s home in Uwhelli, </p><p>Delta State) seeking an urgent meeting with the Ijaw leader. </p><p>Awotorafa, an ethnic Ijaw, explained that he sought Clark\'s </p><p>help in brokering a meeting with the Federated Niger Delta </p><p>Ijaw Communities (FNDIC), the militant Ijaw youth </p><p>organization in the Warri area.  Clark and Awotorafa </p><p>reportedly agreed on a meeting at Clark\'s residence for June </p><p>19. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C/NF) On June 18, however, the Chevron manager contacted </p><p>Clark to postpone the meeting until July 10.  Clark recounted </p><p>that the FNDIC officials had already begun arriving at his </p><p>residence from their remote bases in the creeks of Warri, and </p><p>this last-minute postponement caused great consternation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C/NF)  According to Clark, Awotorafa stated that Chevron </p><p>is anxious to resume production at the wells and flow </p><p>stations of the Warri area and wants to negotiate terms for </p><p>resumption of operations with the FNDIC militants.  The </p><p>Chevron representative reportedly asked Clark to identify </p><p>what the armed youth group wanted in return for Chevron\'s </p><p>safe resumption of production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C/NF) Embassy\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) </p><p>asked Clark if these prospective negotiations would lead to a </p><p>request that Chevron pay the FNDIC militants money.  Clark </p><p>avowed that he would not solicit a payoff but emphasized that </p><p>his role would be solely that of facilitator; he would excuse </p><p>himself from the direct negotiations and, therefore, would </p><p>not be involved in the terms of an agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. In a June 25 meeting with EMBOFFs, FNDIC Advisor Daniel </p><p>Ekpedibe confirmed Chevron overtures to his group.  He added </p><p>that the FNDIC welcomes direct talks with Chevron, which it </p><p>views as decidedly anti-Ijaw in the past.  While also denying </p><p>that the FNDIC seeks a cash payoff from Chevron, Ekpedibe </p><p>stated that Chevron would have to agree to "concessions" to </p><p>the Ijaw, including a redistribution of benefits to the </p><p>various local ethnic communities (e.g. jobs, scholarships and </p><p>community development projects) that would be more favorable </p><p>to the Ijaw of Warri. </p><p>7.(C/NF) Both Clark and Ekpedibe separately confirmed that </p><p>Clark had brokered a meeting between FNDIC leaders and </p><p>representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) earlier in the month.  NNPC requested the </p><p>meeting to negotiate an agreement allowing a NNPC </p><p>sub-contractor access to repair an oil pipeline in the </p><p>Escravos area of Warri.  The pipeline goes to a refinery in </p><p>Kaduna.  (Comment:  Bombings, which occurred a month after </p><p>the outbreak of hostilities in Warri, ruptured the pipeline </p><p>in seven areas and effectively shut down one of Nigeria\'s </p><p>only two operational refineries. The attacks were presumably </p><p>the work of the FNDIC. End Comment)  Clark and Ekpedibe claim </p><p>that a deal was reached, which tracks with press reports that </p><p>NNPC has been granted access to repair  the damaged pipeline. </p><p>  NNPC and its sub-contractor can work securely -- protected </p><p>by FNDIC -- and the repaired pipeline will be protected from </p><p>further sabotage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C/NF) According to several outside sources, including CTX </p><p>officials and NGOs in the Delta, NNPC paid approximately 7 </p><p>million naira ($55,000) to the militants for permission to </p><p>repair the pipeline.  This is a source of irony.  The Ijaw </p><p>militants are a challenge to government authority, yet NNPC </p><p>-- a government entity -- actually paid the militants who in </p><p>turn will become a stiffer challenge to the GON\'s writ in the </p><p>Warri area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C/NF) Comment:  Chevron is no doubt feeling intense </p><p>economic pressure to bring wells back on-line.  Its </p><p>management may have reluctantly decided to follow NNPC\'s lead </p><p>and negotiate with the armed militants.  For now, the Federal </p><p>Government appears unwilling to reassert its authority around </p><p>Warri.  FNDIC controls the area\'s waterways and, at the </p><p>moment, is the guarantor of security or the purveyor of </p><p>violence in the area.  Right now it is the ultimate authority </p><p>and companies wanting to operate in the area have to consult </p><p>its leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C/NF)  Comment Cont\'d: ChevronTexaco is not likely to </p><p>publicize its approach to FNDIC.  CTX\'s last minute </p><p>postponement of discussions with FNDIC --after its initial </p><p>request -- may indicate the company has reservations and </p><p>would like an alternative to dealing with the insurgents. </p><p>Although the militants do not admit that a payoff is sought </p><p>from CTX, this is most certainly their objective.  While this </p><p>stop gap may allow the company to resume operations, any </p><p>payment will promote FNDIC\'s prowess, allowing it to become </p><p>stronger and more entrenched, presenting an even greater </p><p>danger to major U.S. and other oil interests in the Niger </p><p>Delta. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
