<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001019 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITBURO MEMBERS QUIETLY CONSIDER POST-MUGABE ERA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Section Chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons:  1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In an April 24 conversation with political section </p><p>chief, ZANU-PF deputy political commissar Sikhanyiso Ndlovu </p><p>said Politburo members are, for the first time, quietly </p><p>discussing ways to ease President Mugabe out, but few are </p><p>willing to confront the Zimbabwean President directly. </p><p>According to Ndlovu, any solution must contain a "safe </p><p>package" for Mugabe which protects him from prosecution and </p><p>allows him to remain in Zimbabwe.  ZANU-PF heavyweight </p><p>Emmerson Mnangagwa is not well-liked by his senior ruling </p><p>party colleagues, but Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi </p><p>enjoys broad Politburo support as a potential Mugabe </p><p>successor.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Political section chief met on April 24 with ZANU-PF </p><p>deputy political commissar and Politburo member Sikhanyiso </p><p>Ndlovu, at the latter\'s request.  As in previous </p><p>conversations with us, Ndlovu described himself as a voice of </p><p>moderation on the Politburo who regularly tries to restrain </p><p>the worst excesses of party hardliners.  He claimed that, now </p><p>that the election is over, he spends much less of his time on </p><p>politics, concentrating instead on running his private </p><p>educational institutes around the country.  He did not </p><p>inquire whether he had been placed on the list of those </p><p>targetted by U.S. sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>Talk of the post-Mugabe era </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ndlovu reported that, for the first time since he </p><p>joined the Politburo two years ago, members are talking </p><p>openly among themselves about what comes after Mugabe, and </p><p>how to ease the Zimbabwean president out.  The Politburo is </p><p>full of &aspiring8 individuals who want their own chance at </p><p>the top job, Ndlovu pointed out.  Two options have been </p><p>discussed informally among like-minded members.  The first is </p><p>to somehow invoke the section of the draft constitution </p><p>rejected in 2000 creating the position of prime minister. </p><p>Creation of such a post, giving it executive powers, and </p><p>making the presidency a largely ceremonial position would be </p><p>one way to preserve Mugabe\'s ego.  Ndlovu stressed several </p><p>times it was important to provide Mugabe with a &safe </p><p>package8 which protects him from prosecution and allows him </p><p>to live out his remaining years in Zimbabwe.  The second </p><p>possibility under informal consideration is to engineer the </p><p>appointment of two young, vigorous vice-presidents, who </p><p>gradually are able to become the primary decision-makers. </p><p> </p><p>No Support for Election Re-Run </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Polchief emphasized to Ndlovu that the USG did not </p><p>consider Mugabe to have been legitimately elected, and we had </p><p>come to the conclusion that the best way to restore </p><p>legitimacy is via a transitional mechanism that leads to an </p><p>opportunity for Zimbabweans to choose their leader in a </p><p>genuinely free and fair process.  Not surprisingly, Ndlovu </p><p>replied that there is no support whatsoever on the Politburo </p><p>for a rerun of the election, and certainly not one which is </p><p>internationally supervised.  He insisted that Zimbabweans are </p><p>sick of the politicking and violence which accompany </p><p>elections, and just wanted to move forward. </p><p> </p><p>Hardliners vs. the moderates </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ndlovu urged the USG not to paint everyone in ZANU-PF </p><p>with one brush.  The party includes moderates like himself </p><p>who are trying to push for positive change from within.  The </p><p>problem is that the hardliners have the upper hand, and the </p><p>moderates are not willing to stick their necks out.  The one </p><p>prominent exception is retired general Solomon Mujuru, who </p><p>recently asked Mugabe during a Politburo meeting when he </p><p>planned to step down.  Mugabe respects and fears Mujuru, </p><p>Ndlovu said, because the former armed forces chief still </p><p>retains the loyalty of many senior military commanders. </p><p>Mujuru is also now independently wealthy, which gives him a </p><p>freedom for maneuver that those whose livelihoods depend on </p><p>ruling party beneficence do not have.  Even Mujuru, though, </p><p>is careful not to push too hard.  Asked why Politburo members </p><p>who disagreed with ruling party policies did not resign, </p><p>Ndlovu seemed surprised by the question, and said one was </p><p>appointed to the Politburo.  Anyone who tried to resign, he </p><p>said, would face very negative &consequences.8 </p><p>6.  (C) Ndlovu described Speaker of Parliament -) and </p><p>ZANU-PF Secretary for Administration -- Emmerson Mnangagwa as </p><p>a ruling party hardliner &through and through8 who has </p><p>little Politburo support, due primarily to his ruthlessness. </p><p>  Asked whether there was anyone the Politburo would endorse </p><p>as the next President, Ndlovu named Minister of Defense </p><p>Sydney Sekeramayi. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) It is noteworthy that Politburo members are beginning </p><p>to speak openly about the post-Mugabe era and even discussing </p><p>means of nudging out the Zimbabwean president.  It is </p><p>unclear, however, whether those involved in such discussions </p><p>have the capacity or gumption to translate talk into action. </p><p>Ndlovu and his like-minded colleagues apparently have focused </p><p>exclusively on how to prolong the ruling party\'s hold on </p><p>power, minus Mugabe; forging a genuine reconciliation with </p><p>the political opposition has apparently not figured in their </p><p>calculations. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ndlovu, an Ndebele and a youthful-looking 65, is a </p><p>shameless self-promoter whose soliloquies on his </p><p>contributions to Zimbabwe,s nation-building and educational </p><p>system are painful to endure.  (He previously served as </p><p>Deputy Minister of Higher Education and founded a number of </p><p>adult education institutes around the country.)  It is </p><p>unclear how much influence Ndlovu wields among his Politburo </p><p>colleagues, but his key position as deputy political </p><p>commissar and willingness to reach out to us make him worth </p><p>staying in touch with.  He is fond of the United States, with </p><p>which he has longstanding connections -) he earned his </p><p>doctorate in education at Syracuse in the 1970,s, and </p><p>several of his children live in the U.S.  At least one child </p><p>is a U.S. citizen who served in the Marine Corps and who, </p><p>Ndlovu likes to  recollect, got married in the Pentagon mess. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Both of Ndlovu\'s succession scenarios are </p><p>problematic.  The move to ceremonial president does not </p><p>address the issue of whether the autocratic Mugabe would </p><p>continue to dictate policy behind the scenes.  Nomination of </p><p>two young vice presidents can occur only if Mugabe concurs, </p><p>and would face strong resistance from Mnangagwa and other </p><p>hard-liners unless they were the anointed successors. </p><p>Ndlovu\'s scenarios sound to us more like wishful thinking </p><p>than the likely way ahead. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
