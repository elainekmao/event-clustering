<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Sri Lanka\'s English front pages found room for only two </p><p>war-related headlines:  "US-led forces destroy Iraqi </p><p>column" and "US-led troops poised to enter Baghdad as week </p><p>two begins."  The vernacular dailies, by contrast, splashed </p><p>the war across all front pages with headlines such as "Iraq </p><p>`Republican\' military force equipped with 1,000 tanks is </p><p>moving south ... to counter attack coalition forces coming </p><p>to invade Baghdad," "1,000 US paratroopers occupy Iraqi air </p><p>force camp ... largest operation in ten years," and </p><p>"Saddam\'s special task force to protect Baghdad" (Sinhala </p><p>dailies); and "Special forces under Saddam\'s son move to </p><p>protect Baghdad," "30,000 more US forces rush to the Gulf," </p><p>and "New war front in Northern Iraq" as "1,000 U.S. </p><p>soldiers land by parachute." </p><p> </p><p>2. Under the headline "What\'s the role of the UN?" the </p><p>ISLAND (opposition English daily, islandwide circulation) </p><p>discusses a "basic question that is being asked amongst </p><p>western powers ...: who rules Iraq if the Saddam Hussein </p><p>regime is eliminated?.  The ISLAND hopes -- but doubts -- </p><p>that the "UN has to step in at some stage.  The sooner, the </p><p>better."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"With the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of one </p><p>superpower, the prospects of the UN playing a more </p><p>significant role in world affairs was much greater.  Indeed </p><p>President George Bush (Sr.) played according to UN rules </p><p>when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait by putting together a </p><p>coalition of nations in accordance with UN resolutions and </p><p>driving the invader out of Kuwait.  But the son has acted </p><p>like a bull in a china shop.  Whereas even radical, usually </p><p>anti-American Arab states, joined the father\'s coalition </p><p>... Saddam, who has been hated in many Arab countries, is </p><p>being cheered and volunteers queuing up to fight for him. </p><p> </p><p>"The war in the past few days has amply demonstrated </p><p>American power to win it but President Bush has failed to </p><p>convince the world that it is a just war even though he is </p><p>attempting to rid Iraq of a bloody dreaded dictator. </p><p> </p><p>"The UN has to step in at some stage. The sooner, the </p><p>better." </p><p> </p><p>3. Under "Tears and sorrow as a result of war" VIRAKESARI </p><p>(independent Tamil daily, islandwide circulation) laments </p><p>the impact of the war, here in Sri Lanka and there in Iraq. </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"While the U.S. war on Iraq has brought hardship to Iraqis, </p><p>effects of war are being experienced in Sri Lanka now. </p><p> </p><p>"While a sad situation is being created for the hundreds of </p><p>thousands of Sri Lankan workers in the Middle East to </p><p>return to Sri Lanka owing to losing their jobs, the prices </p><p>of the essential items will go up in price because of the </p><p>price hike of the petroleum products. </p><p> </p><p>"With the fall of job opportunities in Middle East, which </p><p>brings most of the foreign exchange, Sri Lanka will be </p><p>further affected the fall in tea exports.  70 percent of </p><p>the tea recently offered in auction remained unsold.  This </p><p>is a big blow to our economy.... </p><p> </p><p>"After killing ... attacking with the latest weapons and </p><p>... and destroying buildings, villages, and cities, </p><p>President Bush says with a smile that freedom for Iraqis is </p><p>dawning....  Bush, building castles upon the lives of </p><p>innocent Iraqi people and against the opposition of the </p><p>people world all over, has requested the Congress to </p><p>allocate $75 billion for the war. </p><p> </p><p>"Another sorrowful chapter in the history of the sufferings </p><p>of the century is being written today." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
