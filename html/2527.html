<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, VM, TH, ASEAN, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT:  MFA ON ASEAN PHUKET MEETING -- </p><p>-      VIETNAM WANTS ASEAN "TERRORISM FREE" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. BANGKOK  1461  B. FBIS SEP20020225000071 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: FM NIEN MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR A </p><p>"TERRORISM-FREE" ASEAN REGION WITHIN 15 YEARS AT THE RECENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00430  270810Z </p><p>PHUKET INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS.  THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREED </p><p>IN PRINCIPLE ON STRENGTHENING COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>THROUGH ENHANCED LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION, IMPROVED </p><p>INFORMATION SHARING, AND OTHER MULTI-LATERAL EFFORTS SUCH AS </p><p>CONTINUED MONITORING OF SUSPECT FINANCIAL TRANSFERS AND THE </p><p>TRANSIT OF SUSPECT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN AND THROUGH THE </p><p>REGION.  FM NIEN ALSO LINKED THE REDUCTION OF TERRORIST </p><p>THREATS TO THE NEED FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) TERRORIST FREE ZONE: ACCORDING TO MFA ASEAN </p><p>DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LE CHI DUNG, FOREIGN MINISTER NGYUEN DY </p><p>NIEN AT THE FEBRUARY 21 ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING IN </p><p>PHUKET URGED HIS COLLEAGUES TO STRIVE TO ERADICATE TERRORISM </p><p>WITHIN ASEAN OVER THE NEXT 10-15 YEARS.  FM NIEN PUSHED FOR </p><p>SUCH A BENCHMARK SO THAT ALL THE ASEAN MEMBERS HAD A COMMON </p><p>LONG-TERM GOAL TOWARD WHICH TO STRIVE WHEN COMBATING </p><p>TERRORISM, DUNG CLAIMED, NOTING THAT VIETNAM WANTS FUTURE </p><p>ASEAN COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS TO BE MULTILATERAL IN FOCUS. </p><p>DUNG ADDED THAT FM NIEN ENVISIONED THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS LEADING THE COORDINATION OF FUTURE COUNTER </p><p>TERRORIST EFFORTS.  FM NIEN ALSO REPORTEDLY SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS\' NATIONAL POLICE FORCES COOPERATE IN SHARING </p><p>INFORMATION AND TACTICS THAT HAVE PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>COMBATING TERRORISM WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES.  IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO A QUESTION, DUNG WAS CAREFUL TO STATE THAT THIS WOULD NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY INVOLVE SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE, BUT RATHER </p><p>SHARING USEFUL AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IMPLEMENTATION: VIETNAM FORESEES NEW CONCRETE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES TO MATERIALIZE BY THIS SUMMER, </p><p>DUNG NOTED.  DURING UPCOMING ASEAN MEETINGS IN BRUNEI AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00430  270810Z </p><p>KUALA LUMPUR, SPECIALISTS WILL COME TOGETHER TO DISCUSS </p><p>FUTURE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND MFA COOPERATION IN GREATER </p><p>DETAIL.  DUNG EXPRESSED VIETNAM\'S HOPE THAT, DURING THESE </p><p>MEETINGS, STRONGER CONCRETE MEASURES WILL BE AGREED UPON IN </p><p>ORDER TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) POVERTY ALLIEVIATION:  HOWEVER, FM NIEN\'S PRIMARY </p><p>FOCUS FOR COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CENTERED ON </p><p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION, ACCORDING TO DUNG.  FM NIEN ARGUED THAT </p><p>MANY OF THE RANKS OF TERRORIST CELLS FOUND IN OTHER ASEAN </p><p>STATES, NOTABLY INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA, WERE FILLED WITH THE </p><p>POOREST SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY.  HE ALSO REPORTEDLY ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE PEOPLE ATTRACTED TO TERRORISM WERE DRAWN TO THESE GROUPS </p><p>DUE TO LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS </p><p>DISGRUNTLEMENT WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTS DUE TO THEIR POOR </p><p>ECONOMIC STATUS.  DUNG SAID THAT FM NIEN HAD ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>BEST MEANS OF COMBATING TERRORISM WAS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE POTENTIAL RECRUITS/MILITANTS, AND, </p><p>IN SO DOING, LIMIT THE APPEAL OF TERRORISM.  DUNG CLAIMED </p><p>THAT FM NIEN FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT IMPROVED ECONOMIC </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POOREST PEOPLES OF ASEAN, COMBINED </p><p>WITH A COORDINATED LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROACH, WILL LIMIT THE </p><p>GROWTH OF TERRORISM WITHIN ASEAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) COMMENT:  FM NIEN\'S FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE </p><p>ECONOMIC SITUATION OF ASEAN\'S POOREST CITIZENS SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>SURPRISING, GIVEN THAT VIETNAM HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF </p><p>SHAPING THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SHRINKING THE "DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GAP" AMONG ASEAN MEMBER STATES.  VIETNAM\'S APPARENT </p><p>WILLINGNESS WITHIN ASEAN TO SPEAK OUT FORCEFULLY ON COUNTER- </p><p>TERRORISM IS NONETHELESS A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00430  270810Z </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
