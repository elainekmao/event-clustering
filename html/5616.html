<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LAGOS 000307 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/CC, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NI, PINS </p><p>SUBJECT: LAGOS EXPLOSION AND NNPC FIRE FOLLOW-UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: RSO J. Pelphrey.  Reason 1.5 (d) and (g) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary: RSO met with police officials on Thursday </p><p>and Friday 02/06 and 02/07 regarding last Sunday\'s explosion </p><p>in Lagos.  Police provided some insight into the explosion. </p><p>RSO staff has also been in contact with the bomb squad in an </p><p>effort to see explosives taken from the scene.  One police </p><p>contact provided additional thoughts on the fire at NNPC. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On Thursday 02/06/03, RSO met with Assistant </p><p>Commissioner Ojiri (please protect) concerning police support </p><p>for the Consulate in the event of hostilities and to request </p><p>information regarding the explosion on Sunday 02/02/03.  AC </p><p>Ojiri confirmed that the area of the explosion is a market </p><p>area where Lagos merchants go to buy wholesale merchandise </p><p>for resale throughout Lagos.  He said he did not believe the </p><p>explosion was terrorist related and cited the death of a </p><p>local Immam as proof.  The explosion could have been </p><p>politically motivated citing the upcoming elections.  The </p><p>most likely cause of the explosions was the storage of the </p><p>explosives by someone needing money and having a storage </p><p>space for rent.  Unfortunately, the bomb squad was unable to </p><p>identify the origin of the explosives.  When RSO offered that </p><p>the USG was standing by to offer assistance if requested, AC </p><p>Ojiri said that the Nigerian Police were not yet ready to </p><p>request assistance, but he would pass on the offer on Friday </p><p>when he met with the Lagos State Commissioner of Police  When </p><p>asked if the house where the explosion took place might be a </p><p>bomb factory, AC Ojiri initially did not understand the </p><p>question stating the place of the explosion was not the </p><p>target.  When asked again, AC Ojiri suggested the possibility </p><p>that the owner of the explosives asked someone to arrange </p><p>storage for a fee and the explosives were stored in a </p><p>warehouse area of the residence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On Friday 02/07/03, RSO met with Superintendent </p><p>Garba Baba-Umar (please protect) head of Ikoyi Island police </p><p>district.  During the conversation, Superintendent Baba-Umar </p><p>described the explosives as two types.  One type was long and </p><p>rectangular about the size of a desktop stapler and the </p><p>second was round like an apple but bigger than a hand </p><p>grenade.  The Superintendent advised that members of the bomb </p><p>squad had never seen these types of explosives.  The </p><p>Superintendent offered the following description of events of </p><p>the explosion:  There was a small explosion that started a </p><p>fire followed by two larger explosions that brought down the </p><p>houses.  The superintendent did not offer how the first </p><p>explosion was caused.  The Superintendent said he suggested a </p><p>sweep of the neighborhood to locate additional caches of </p><p>explosives to his superiors, but his idea was not </p><p>enthusiastically received.  He advised that he believes the </p><p>investigation is going slowly because Lagos State politics </p><p>was behind the explosions.  He cited the confiscation of </p><p>numerous weapons by numerous agencies in the past several </p><p>months as further evidence of Lagos State political </p><p>involvement in recent problems.  He also advised that </p><p>numerous "area boys" who have been involved in a gang war </p><p>have been charged to court for criminal activities only to be </p><p>released on bail at the urging of political leaders and their </p><p>lawyers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Superintendent Baba Umar (please protect) provided </p><p>the following information regarding the NNPC fire.  He said </p><p>that he has a tape recording of the suspect from the NNPC </p><p>fire in which the suspect admits starting the fire.  The </p><p>Superintendent advised that he did not believe the suspect </p><p>participated in the fire.  The Superintendent advised the </p><p>only troubling part of the confession was the suspect\'s </p><p>reference that Kaduna would be next.  The Superintendent </p><p>advised that the NNPC refinery in Kaduna caught fire the day </p><p>following the fire at NNPC headquarters in Lagos.  The </p><p>Superintendent said he believed the NNPC fires were </p><p>politically motivated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  RSO FSNI has spoken to the bomb squad deputy </p><p>commander several times during the week who has confirmed the </p><p>explosives are commercial explosives.  RSO has requested to </p><p>see the explosives with the intention of photographing them. </p><p>The Commander of the bomb squad was in Abuja on Friday and </p><p>the request will be made again on Monday.  The investigation </p><p>into the cause of the explosion continues.  RSO will provide </p><p>additional information as it becomes available. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
