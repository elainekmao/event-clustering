<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000537 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IL WHA/PPC AND WHA/CEN </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR ILAB: ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p>USTR FOR BUD CLATANOFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, KDEM, ASEC, CASC, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: TEACHERS STRIKE DEEPENS, TESTING GOG </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 507 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 473 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  February 26, Day 38 of the national </p><p>teachers strike affecting 80,000 public schoolteachers and </p><p>over 2 million students, saw blockades of major airports, </p><p>ports, border crossings, and oil refineries, and the </p><p>indefinite suspension of Congress due to the protests.  After </p><p>receiving a conciliatory message from President Portillo </p><p>later that day, however, strikers abandoned protests blocking </p><p>Guatemala\'s two international airports on February 27. </p><p>Wrangling between strikers and the GOG now appears back to </p><p>the bargaining table, mediated by Archbishop Quezada Toruno. </p><p>The Archbishop told the Ambassador early on February 26 that </p><p>the GOG\'s ability to increase the budget is constrained. </p><p>Strike leaders told LabAtt they are committed to non-violence </p><p>and do not seek to destabilize the GOG by collaborating with </p><p>opposition groups including the organized private sector. </p><p>Nevertheless, the teacher strike occurs at a moment of </p><p>vulnerability for the GOG and governing FRG, and could spur </p><p>additional protests if it continues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Teachers Give Their Side of Conflict </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On February 26 LabAtt met with a group of strike </p><p>leaders including Nery Barrios, Secretary General of the </p><p>Unity of Social and Popular Action (UASP) labor federation, </p><p>and Teachers Association leaders Roberto Madrid, Romualdo </p><p>Maldonado, Joviel Acevedo, and Julio Solano.  LabAtt stated </p><p>USG concerns over the blockage by protesters of airports, </p><p>ports and border crossings, which we do not view as </p><p>legitimate means to impel dialogue in a democracy.  Strike </p><p>leaders responded that throughout a long and frustrating </p><p>process that originated over a year ago, they have strictly </p><p>maintained a policy of non-violence and has striven mightily </p><p>to prevent their members from responding in kind to </p><p>intimidation, threats and provocations from anti-strike </p><p>agents.  Acevedo said he had received threats explicitly </p><p>sourced to the Presidential Guard (EMP), and that his home </p><p>has been invaded and family members threatened.  Solano said </p><p>he had also suffered similar threats.  Strike leaders agreed </p><p>to keep this meeting with LabAtt confidential, and did not </p><p>ask for any public Embassy role in their conflict.  Madrid </p><p>suggested, however, that the Consultative Group might </p><p>helpfully address the issue of educational reform directly in </p><p>its May meeting resolutions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Strike leaders said that strikers had received and </p><p>rejected many offers by opposition political parties and </p><p>other groups including university students, campesinos and </p><p>the private sector to join the teachers\' protests.  The </p><p>teachers said they rejected these offers, most recently from </p><p>the president of the main employer association (CACIF) </p><p>because the do not want to lose control, be used for partisan </p><p>political ends, or for the situation to threaten the </p><p>democratic stability of the country.  LabAtt praised this </p><p>stance.  Madrid summarized the origins and motivation of the </p><p>teachers\' demands, which the GOG and media have distorted by </p><p>portraying the conflict as essentially about salaries/budgets </p><p>instead of the educational reforms blocked by the FRG in </p><p>Congress in August 2002, which provoked the current </p><p>escalation of direct action by teachers.  However, key </p><p>demands that must be addressed for the teachers to return to </p><p>class include an agreement on the budget increase for the </p><p>education ministry, and a GOG commitment to desist from </p><p>reprisals against strikers.  (Note: A labor court judge </p><p>declared the strike illegal on February 20 and gave strikers </p><p>five days to report to work, which was promptly appealed by </p><p>strikers.  If upheld, strikers who refuse to return to work </p><p>could be legally dismissed.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>CACIF Denies Meddling </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Upon hearing of teachers\' allegations of CACIF </p><p>offers to support teachers with a "general strike," </p><p>EconCouns, on Ambassdor\'s instructions, expressed concern to </p><p>Roberto Castaneda, current Chamber of Agriculture President </p><p>and CACIF Vice President,  who will be named CACIF\'s new </p><p>President starting March 3.  Castaneda agreed that, if true, </p><p>Nuetze was "out of line," and he reconfirmed what CACIF </p><p>leaders told the Ambassador on February 25:  they are </p><p>concerned over apparent escalation of agitation against the </p><p>government and have the perception that situation could </p><p>spiral out of control.  Calm and leadership, not inciting </p><p>passions, was what the country needed, they told the </p><p>Ambassador.  Castaneda promised to look into this and get </p><p>back to us. </p><p> </p><p>Archbishop Sees Difficult Negotiations Ahead </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Archbishop Rodolfo Quezada Toruno told Ambassador </p><p>in a courtesy call on February 26 that it would be very </p><p>difficult to resolve the conflict, which he was called upon </p><p>to mediate by both sides.  Three early rounds of meetings </p><p>during the week of February 14 were getting nowhere, so on </p><p>February 24, Quezada told both sides that without a shift in </p><p>positions, he saw no reason to continue.  When the GOG, </p><p>represented at the dialogue table by the Ministers of </p><p>Education, Labor, and Finance, expressed willingness to </p><p>consider an increase to the education ministry\'s budget, </p><p>Quezada asked strike leaders to reconsider their demand for </p><p>2.8 billion queztals and submit a more realistic proposal. </p><p>He had not received a response when Ambassador and LabAtt </p><p>called on him, but confided that he believed the most the GOG </p><p>could offer would be an increase of 1 billion, without having </p><p>to raise the consumption tax, which would be politically </p><p>impossible.  That would permit a salary raise of 2-300 </p><p>quetzals per month ($25-38) and money left over to improve </p><p>schools.  Quezada Toruno noted that the Education Ministry </p><p>budget currently comprises 11% of the budget, the highest </p><p>amount after payment of government debt.  Minister of Finance </p><p>Eduardo Weymann publicly defended the level of that budget, </p><p>saying it was now 40% higher than in 1999. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On other issues, Quezada thanked the Ambassador </p><p>(three times) for his early visits to human rights defenders, </p><p>including the Archbishop\'s Office on Human Rights (ODHAG), </p><p>for the important signal that sent of U.S. interest. </p><p>Quezada\'s most difficult decision, he said, since taking </p><p>office in June 2001, was to continue the Church\'s status as a </p><p>plaintiff in the Gerardi case.  The Ambassador praised that </p><p>decision as the right one, and asked whether Quezada believed </p><p>the justice system had revealed the truth of the Gerardi </p><p>killing.  Quezada said no, but expressed confidence in the </p><p>Supreme Court ruling that the appeals (but not the original </p><p>verdict) be re-done.  Asked by the Ambassador for his view on </p><p>the complicity of Mario Orantes, the priest sentenced to 20 </p><p>years for his role in the crime, Quezada said he believed, </p><p>with the vast majority of the clergy, that Orantes knows more </p><p>than he is saying. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The teachers\' strike occurs at a moment of weakness </p><p>for the GOG and the governing FRG: </p><p> </p><p>-- GOG intervention to save another failed bank (supposedly </p><p>to protect cronies) and continued efforts to pay off the </p><p>ex-PACs (former civil defense patrols whose votes the FRG </p><p>wants) contrast with its inability to meet teachers\' demands. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOG seeks to stay in the good graces of the IMF, in </p><p>large part so it can attract more foreign bond buyers </p><p>(proceeds will go to projects that help the FRG\'s 2003 </p><p>campaign), so its budget options are limited. </p><p> </p><p>-- Just as the GOG\'s cave-in to ex-PACs in 2002 probably </p><p>encouraged the teachers to strike, a perceived capitulation </p><p>to the teachers would make it difficult to fend off a </p><p>transport strike (due to shrinking profits on bus fares due </p><p>to fuel price increases). </p><p> </p><p>-- Portillo has hitherto absented himself from the strike </p><p>issue, fueling unfounded speculation and uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>-- With the election campaign to begin formally in May, there </p><p>is no incentive in other parties to oppose the strike. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While strike leaders now tell us that the GOG\'s new </p><p>flexibility had brought dialogue "back from the brink," deep </p><p>divisions over money and many other issues remain on the </p><p>bargaining table, including the issue of lost wages for </p><p>strikers during this month out of class.  Portillo\'s overdue </p><p>intervention to mollify protesters is typical of his crisis </p><p>management, and follows a similar move with campesino groups </p><p>earlier this week.  Unfortunately, Portillo\'s history of </p><p>dealing with protests by announcing half-measures and </p><p>unfulfilled commitments have deepened skepticism and </p><p>prolonged protests to the point where they reach the crisis </p><p>point, as in this instance.  This strike, which enjoyed broad </p><p>popular support, could prove the most politically costly to </p><p>Portillo and the FRG, alienating left-leaning teachers who </p><p>help shape public opinion in the provinces. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) While a major inconvenience to travelers and </p><p>serious drain on commercial activity, this conflict has not </p><p>to date directly threatened U.S. citizens nor has it risen to </p><p>a level of a threat to Guatemalan democracy.  We will </p><p>continue to monitor protests with a view to U.S. citizen </p><p>security and other U.S. interests. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
