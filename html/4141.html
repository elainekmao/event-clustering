(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT BELLARD; REASON </p><p>1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY:  PROTESTANT CONTACTS REPORT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02628  01 OF 03  310933Z </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED DIFFICULTIES IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS PROVINCE OF DAK LAK, WITH CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>PROTESTANTS DESCRIBED AS THE MOST RESTRICTIVE SINCE </p><p>THE LATE 1970\'S.  HMONG PROTESTANTS IN THE </p><p>NORTHWESTERN PROVINCE OF LAI CHAU REPORT </p><p>"CONSIDERABLE" PRESSURE TO RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH, WHILE </p><p>IN THE NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF LAO CAI,  DISTRICT </p><p>AUTHORITIES ALLOW PROTESTANTS TO PRACTICE THEIR </p><p>RELIGION PRIVATELY.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS HIGHLIGHT THE </p><p>BROAD VARIATIONS IN TREATMENT PROTESTANTS RECEIVE FROM </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.  THE NORTHERN </p><p>EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM (ECVN) IS ATTEMPTING </p><p>FORMALLY TO ACCEPT SEVERAL HUNDRED MOSTLY HMONG </p><p>CONGREGATIONS INTO ITS RANKS, ALTHOUGH THE GVN MAY NOT </p><p>PERMIT THIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN THREE SEPARATE MEETINGS FROM OCTOBER 12 TO </p><p>OCTOBER 18, PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCH LEADER PASTOR </p><p>"STEPHEN" AND A THIRD COUNTRY NATIONAL (TCN) WHO HAS </p><p>REQUESTED THAT HIS NAME NOT BE USED INFORMED POLOFF OF </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING VIETNAM\'S CHRISTIANS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND </p><p>NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS.  BOTH SOURCES HAVE PROVIDED </p><p>RELIABLE INFORMATION TO THE MISSION IN THE PAST. </p><p>PASTOR STEPHEN NOTED THAT HIS INFORMATION WAS MOSTLY </p><p>SECOND-HAND, PASSED TO HIM FROM PROTESTANT PASTORS AND </p><p>LEADERS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND NORTHWEST WHO </p><p>LOOK TO HIM FOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSISTANCE.  THE TCN </p><p>IDENTIFIED HIS SOURCES AS AN EDE PASTOR, Y KEH </p><p>(PHONETIC), WHOM HE SAYS HE HAS KNOWN FOR OVER THIRTY </p><p>YEARS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS PROTESTANTS IN HANOI WHOM HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02628  01 OF 03  310933Z </p><p>CALLED "LONG-STANDING ASSOCIATES." </p><p> </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PASTOR STEPHEN DESCRIBED A THREE-DAY </p><p>CONFERENCE DURING JULY IN DAK LAK IN WHICH GVN </p><p>AUTHORITIES REACHED A DECISION TO "PURIFY </p><p>PROTESTANTISM IN VIETNAM."  HE CLAIMED THAT THIS MEANT </p><p>"DESTROYING," OR AT LEAST "LIMITING" PROTESTANTISM. </p><p>HE REPORTED THAT PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT-LEVEL </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE LEADERS FROM KON TUM, GIA LAI, LAM </p><p>DONG, AND DAK LAK PROVINCES ATTENDED THE MEETING, BUT </p><p>SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF NATIONAL-LEVEL OFFICIALS </p><p>PARTICIPATED.  THE INFORMATION, HE INDICATED, CAME </p><p>FROM SECRETLY CHRISTIAN OFFICIALS WHO HAD ATTENDED THE </p><p>MEETINGS.  SEPARATELY, THE TCN CLAIMED THAT LOCAL </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS WERE TELLING SOME PROTESTANT </p><p>BELIEVERS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS THAT INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>TO ACT AGAINST THEM CAME FROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>DAK LAK </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BOTH PASTOR STEPHEN AND THE TCN SAID THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN DAK LAK HAD BECOME "DRAMATICALLY WORSE" </p><p>SINCE AUGUST.  THE TCN OPINED THAT THIS WAS SOMEWHAT </p><p>SURPRISING BECAUSE GIA LAI HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN </p><p>GENERALLY TOUGHER AGAINST PROTESTANTS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>HIS SOURCE Y KEH, DAK LAK AUTHORITIES PROHIBIT ALL </p><p>MEETINGS, CLOSELY CONTROL MOVEMENT BY BOTH ETHNIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02628  01 OF 03  310933Z </p><p>MINORITIES AND MAJORITY KINH, AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN </p><p>TIGHTER CONTROL, MORE SO THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE </p><p>LATE 1970\'S.  THE TCN REVIEWED THREE DIFFERENT </p><p>INCIDENTS IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE REPORTEDLY </p><p>"DISAPPEARED" IN DAK LAK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN THE FIRST "DISAPPEARANCE," REPORTED </p><p>ORIGINALLY BY THE WIFE OF A HOUSE CHURCH PASTOR, A </p><p>DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN DAK LAK INVITED THE </p><p>PASTOR TO DINNER IN EARLY AUGUST -- AN "ODD" EVENT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE TCN.  THE PASTOR NEVER RETURNED FROM </p><p>THE DINNER, ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT HE HAD LEFT IN GOOD CONDITION AND EVEN SHOWED HIS </p><p>WIFE AN UNSPECIFIED DOCUMENT THAT THE PASTOR HAD </p><p>PURPORTEDLY SIGNED DURING THE DINNER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IN THE SECOND INCIDENT, DISTRICT-LEVEL POLICE </p><p>IN DAK LAK DETAINED ABOUT 240 PERSONS AT A SUNDAY </p><p>GATHERING ON EITHER AUGUST 18 OR AUGUST 25.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS WAS A WORSHIP SERVICE, BUT ALL </p><p>THOSE GATHERED WERE REPORTEDLY ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>PROTESTANTS.

(C)  ON AUGUST 28, IN M\'DRAK DISTRICT IN </p><p>NORTHEASTERN DAK LAK, SECURITY FORCES REPORTEDLY </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO DETAIN A HOUSE CHURCH PASTOR AND HIS TWO </p><p>ADULT SONS.  A GROUP OF LOCAL PEOPLE GATHERED AND </p><p>PREVENTED THE AUTHORITIES FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR </p><p>PLANS.  THE AUTHORITIES LEFT, BUT LATER RETURNED WITH </p><p>REINFORCEMENTS.  A TOTAL OF ABOUT 120 LOCAL RESIDENTS </p><p>GATHERED TO PROTECT THE PASTOR AND HIS SONS.  IN THE </p><p>ENSUING "DONNYBROOK," AS THE TCN DESCRIBED IT, ONE </p><p>VILLAGER WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT OR THE LEG (APPARENTLY </p><p>THE WOUND WAS NOT SERIOUS) AND AUTHORITIES DETAINED </p><p>ALL 120 VILLAGERS.  AGAIN, AUTHORITIES QUICKLY </p><p>RELEASED MOST, BUT AS OF MID-OCTOBER, BETWEEN 20 AND </p><p>30 HAD NOT RETURNED HOME.  AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED DETAINING THEM.  THE PASTOR AND HIS SONS </p><p>ALSO REPORTEDLY HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE AUGUST 28. </p><p> </p><p>THE HMONG </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ALSO IN AUGUST, ACCORDING TO THE TCN, HMONG </p><p>"SPONTANEOUS MIGRANTS" WHO HAD MOVED TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS FROM THEIR HOMES IN THE NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS </p><p>BEGINNING IN THE MID- TO LATE-1990\'S, RECEIVED VISITS </p><p>FROM OFFICIALS OF THEIR HOME PROVINCES.  THESE </p><p>OFFICIALS, WITH COOPERATION FROM CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>AUTHORITIES, WERE REPORTEDLY TRYING TO INDUCE THE </p><p>HMONG TO MOVE BACK TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE TCN SAID </p><p>THAT IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT MEANS THEY WERE USING TO </p><p>CONVINCE THE HMONG TO DO THIS.  SO FAR, NONE OF THE </p><p>HMONG ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02628  02 OF 03  310933Z </p><p>RETURN TO THE NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS.  (NOTE:  AT LEAST </p><p>SOME REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE PRIMARY REASON THE HMONG </p><p>MOVED TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WAS TO HAVE MORE </p><p>FREEDOM TO PRACTICE PROTESTANTISM.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>A BRIGHTER PICTURE IN LAU CAI </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  ACCORDING TO PASTOR STEPHEN, DURING THE </p><p>SUMMER, POLICE IN BAO YEN DISTRICT OF LAU CAI INFORMED </p><p>LOCAL HMONG PROTESTANTS THAT, WHILE THEY COULD NOT </p><p>GATHER TO WORSHIP, THEY COULD PRACTICE THEIR FAITH IN </p><p>THEIR HOMES.  POLICE ARE REPORTEDLY HONORING THIS </p><p>ARRANGEMENT, BASED ON THE GVN\'S CURRENT DECREE ON </p><p>RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>FOUR FAMILIES FROM DIEN BIEN DONG </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  ACCORDING TO PASTOR STEPHEN, ON APRIL 12, </p><p>2001, OFFICIALS OF DIEN BIEN DONG DISTRICT OF LAI CHAU </p><p>CAME TO PHINH GIANG VILLAGE AND URGED THE FIVE </p><p>PROTESTANT FAMILIES AMONG THE 40 FAMILIES IN THE </p><p>VILLAGE TO RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH "BECAUSE THE VILLAGE </p><p>IS NOT PROTESTANT."  ONE FAMILY COMPLIED, BUT THE </p><p>OTHER FOUR REFUSED.  THE AUTHORITIES THEN TOLD THE </p><p>FOUR FAMILIES THAT THEY HAD TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE. </p><p>POLICE AND MILITIA REPORTEDLY THREW ALL OF THEIR </p><p>BELONGINGS OUT OF THEIR HOUSES AND BEAT ONE OF THE </p><p>FAMILY HEADS, MUA BUA SINH, UNTIL BLOOD CAME FROM HIS </p><p>MOUTH AND NOSE. SINH\'S WIFE REPORTEDLY FINALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02628  02 OF 03  310933Z </p><p>PERSUADED HIM TO LEAVE AND THE FOUR FAMILIES GATHERED </p><p>THEIR BELONGINGS AND DEPARTED FOR A VILLAGE IN DIEN </p><p>BIEN PHU DISTRICT, AN HOUR\'S WALK AWAY.  PASTOR </p><p>STEPHEN CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THIS ACCOUNT FROM MUA </p><p>BUA SINH\'S BROTHER AND ALSO GAVE POLOFF COPIES OF </p><p>SEVERAL LETTERS OF COMPLAINT THE FAMILIES WROTE TO </p><p>VARIOUS GVN OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  DIEN BIEN PHU DISTRICT OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY </p><p>DID NOT ALLOW THE FAMILIES TO REGISTER THEIR </p><p>RESIDENCES IN THAT DISTRICT AND HAVE SOMETIMES </p><p>HARASSED THEM AS WELL.  PASTOR STEPHEN SAID THAT MUA </p><p>BUA SINH EVENTUALLY DIED ON JULY 8, 2002 AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE APRIL 12, 2001 BEATING, ALTHOUGH HE WAS UNABLE </p><p>TO EXPLAIN WHY THE BEATING WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO </p><p>SINH\'S DEATH.  PASTOR STEPHEN GAVE POLOFF A PHOTO OF </p><p>SINH\'S CORPSE.  SINH\'S WIDOW AND SIX CHILDREN MOVED TO </p><p>SON LA PROVINCE LATER IN JULY, FOLLOWED IN AUGUST BY </p><p>TWO OF THE OTHER FAMILIES.  THE THREE FAMILIES HAVE </p><p>NOT BEEN ABLE TO REGISTER THEIR RESIDENCE IN SON LA </p><p>PROVINCE EITHER, BUT OFFICIALS THERE REPORTEDLY LEAVE </p><p>THEM ALONE.  MUA BUA SINH\'S BROTHER\'S FAMILY IS </p><p>REPORTEDLY STILL IN DIEN BIEN PHU DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2418 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02628  03 OF 03  310934Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PRS-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------0136E1  310934Z /38 </p><p>P 310923Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7972 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 002628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>TUAN GIAO DISTRICT IN LAI CHAU </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02628  03 OF 03  310934Z </p><p>13.  (C)  PASTOR STEPHEN REPORTED THAT IN EARLY </p><p>OCTOBER THE LEADERS OF FIVE PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>IN TUAN GIAO DISTRICT OF LAI CHAU HAD MET HIM IN HANOI </p><p>AND DESCRIBED EVENTS IN THEIR DISTRICT.  THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN 21 PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES IN THE DISTRICT, BUT </p><p>BEGINNING EARLY IN 2002, AUTHORITIES BEGAN PRESSURING </p><p>THEM TO ABANDON THEIR FAITH.  SECURITY FORCES, </p><p>INCLUDING "REGULAR POLICE" AND "BORDER POLICE," </p><p>ACCORDING TO PASTOR STEPHEN, HAVE BEEN APPEARING EVERY </p><p>WEEK AT HOUSE CHURCH SERVICES TO TELL WORSHIPPERS THAT </p><p>"THOSE WHO DO NOT DENY CHRIST ARE ANTI-COMMUNIST," </p><p>THAT "PROTESTANTISM IS AN AMERICAN RELIGION," AND THAT </p><p>"IF YOU INTEND TO KEEP YOUR FAITH YOU SHOULD LEAVE AND </p><p>GO TO AMERICA."  THE APPARENT LEADER OF THIS CAMPAIGN </p><p>WAS THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE PROVINCIAL POLICE.  PASTOR </p><p>STEPHEN SAID THAT 16 OF THE HOUSE CHURCH CONGREGATIONS </p><p>ARE NOW DEFUNCT, BUT THAT THE OTHER FIVE ARE STILL </p><p>OPERATING. </p><p> </p><p>THE ECVN REACHES OUT TO HMONG HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  THE TCN TOLD POLOFF THAT THE OFFICIALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED ECVN\'S GOVERNING BOARD HAD DECIDED IN MID- </p><p>SEPTEMBER TO TAKE MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS FROM HMONG </p><p>HOUSE CHURCHES.  (NOTE:  THE ECVN ELECTED THE CURRENT </p><p>BOARD IN 1988; ONLY THREE OF THE FIVE MEMBERS ELECTED </p><p>THEN ARE STILL ALIVE, BUT THE ECVN HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>PERMITTED TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS OR HOLD A CONGRESS. </p><p>END NOTE.)  THE ECVN RECEIVED OVER 300 APPLICATIONS </p><p>AND, BY OCTOBER 16, THE BOARD HAD APPROVED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02628  03 OF 03  310934Z </p><p>APPLICATIONS FROM 204 HMONG CONGREGATIONS IN LAI CHAU, </p><p>22 IN LAO CAI, AND ONE NON-HMONG CONGREGATION IN THAI </p><p>NGUYEN.  THE BOARD STILL HAD ABOUT 100 APPLICATIONS TO </p><p>CONSIDER.  THE TCN SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF ANY </p><p>WERE REFUSED.  ON OCTOBER 20, THE TCN PROVIDED CONGEN </p><p>HCMC POLOFF A LIST OF THE 227 APPROVED CONGREGATIONS, </p><p>ALONG WITH A SAMPLE APPLICATION LETTER FROM ONE HMONG </p><p>CONGREGATION DATED JULY 17, 2002 AND AN ECVN APPROVAL </p><p>FORM FOR ANOTHER CONGREGATION DATED OCTOBER 9, 2002. </p><p>THE 227 CONGREGATIONS LISTED RANGED IN SIZE FROM 470 </p><p>TO 25 MEMBERS.  THE ECVN CURRENTLY CLAIMS ABOUT 8,000 </p><p>MEMBERS IN ONLY 14 CONGREGATIONS.  THE ECVN HAS NOT </p><p>INFORMED THE GVN ABOUT THIS ACTION YET, THE TCN </p><p>STATED.  COMMENTING ON THIS UNUSUALLY BOLD MOVE, THE </p><p>TCN SAID THAT THE ECVN BOARD PROBABLY FELT THAT IT </p><p>"HAD NOTHING TO LOSE." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE </p><p>REMAIN WIDE DISPARITIES BETWEEN HOW AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>DIFFERENT PROVINCES, EVEN IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS, </p><p>TREAT PROTESTANTS IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS.  THE ECVN\'S </p><p>MOVE TO INTEGRATE HMONG PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>REFLECTS THE INDEPENDENCE THE CHURCH HAS ASSERTED IN </p><p>REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE GVN\'S CONDITIONS FOR HOLDING AN </p><p>ANNUAL MEETING SINCE 1988.  ECVN TIES TO THE HMONG </p><p>DATE BACK AT LEAST TO THE EARLY 1990\'S.   THE ECVN\'S </p><p>INFORMAL LEADER, PASTOR AU QUANG VINH OF HANOI, HAS </p><p>EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES WITH THE AUTHORITIES SINCE </p><p>1994, WHEN HE HELPED PUBLISH AN UNAUTHORIZED HMONG </p><p>LANGUAGE BIBLE.  THE GVN HAS CLAIMED THAT THE HMONG DO </p><p>NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND PROTESTANTISM AND ARE OFTEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02628  03 OF 03  310934Z </p><p>DECEIVED BY CHARLATANS SEEKING THEIR OWN BENEFIT.  THE </p><p>ECVN ACTIONS FORMALLY TO WELCOME HMONG HOUSE CHURCHES </p><p>MAY BRING THIS ISSUE TO A NEW BOIL. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
