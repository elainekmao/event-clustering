<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR AMBASSADOR TONY HALL, MAX FINBERG AND TIM </p><p>LAVELLE AT FODAG </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA BACKGROUND AND THEMES FOR AMBASSADOR </p><p>HALL\'S VISIT TO ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR POSTING ON THE </p><p>INTERNET. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) Media Background: The Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>   (GoZ) has deliberately and successfully limited media </p><p>   freedom and the flow of information into and out of </p><p>   Zimbabwe.   The majority of Zimbabweans must rely on </p><p>   heavily propagandistic government media for news and </p><p>   analysis of local and international events.  The flow </p><p>   of news out of Zimbabwe has been restricted through the </p><p>   expulsion of once-resident foreign journalists and </p><p>   refusals to grant visas to international journalists </p><p>   wishing to visit. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Radio is the most influential medium in </p><p>   Zimbabwe.  The GoZ has a monopoly on local broadcast </p><p>   media and they offer only unrelenting pro-government </p><p>   propaganda.  One independent broadcaster, Voice of the </p><p>   People, maintained offices in Zimbabwe and provided </p><p>   news and information via Dutch short wave facilities </p><p>   until its Harare office was completely destroyed by a </p><p>   sophisticated firebombing in late August 2002.  Another </p><p>   short wave broadcaster, Short Wave Radio Africa, </p><p>   provides news and information from studios in the </p><p>   United Kingdom.  Anecdotal information indicates that </p><p>   short wave broadcasters have only small audiences. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) Urban Zimbabweans have access to a </p><p>   courageous independent press consisting of one daily </p><p>   and three weeklies (the Daily News, Financial Gazette, </p><p>   Zimbabwe Independent, and the Standard).   Prices, </p><p>   logistical challenges, and the fact that pro-government </p><p>   forces have banned the distribution of independent </p><p>   newspapers in rural areas means that most rural </p><p>   Zimbabweans (60% of the population) have no access to </p><p>   these publications.  The independent press is under </p><p>   steady pressure from the GoZ and pro-government forces. </p><p>   Arrests of editors and reporters are common and the </p><p>   Daily News has twice been bombed, most recently in </p><p>   January 2001 in a sophisticated attack that completely </p><p>   destroyed the paper\'s presses.   No arrests have been </p><p>   made.  The Daily News recently replaced its presses.  A </p><p>   new media registration law, to come into force later </p><p>   this year, is likely to result in increased arrests and </p><p>   harassment of journalists working for the independent </p><p>   press. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) The GoZ owns and exercises tight editorial </p><p>   control over two dailies and three weeklies (the </p><p>   Herald, Chronicle, Sunday Mail, Sunday News and Manica </p><p>   Post).  Although the circulation of these papers has </p><p>   seen a steady decline, they are generally the only </p><p>   newspapers available in rural Zimbabwe.  There is a </p><p>   distinct double standard in the application of media </p><p>   control laws to the independent and government-owned </p><p>   media. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) Over the last 18 months, non-Zimbabweans </p><p>   working for the BBC, Agence France Presse, the Mail and </p><p>   Guardian (South Africa) and other international media </p><p>   have been forced to leave the country.  BBC has </p><p>   explicitly been banned.  The new media registration law </p><p>   is likely to result in the closure of the Associated </p><p>   Press, Reuters and AFP bureaus in Zimbabwe, all </p><p>   currently staffed by Zimbabwean citizens.   The GoZ </p><p>   routinely denies visas to journalists who openly apply </p><p>   to visit the country for reporting purposes. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U) Media Themes for Ambassador Hall\'s Visit: </p><p>   Ambassador Hall\'s visit could usefully promote several </p><p>   themes in the media: </p><p> </p><p>   A) Zimbabwe\'s food crisis is becoming increasingly </p><p>   severe. </p><p> </p><p>   B) The Government of Zimbabwe should make policy </p><p>   decisions to permit the private sector and a larger </p><p>   number of NGOs to take part in helping to meet the </p><p>   nation\'s food needs. </p><p> </p><p>  C) Among the policy issues we believe are </p><p>  exacerbating the food crisis are the Grain Marketing </p><p>  Board\'s monopoly on grain imports and sales; </p><p>  unrealistically low controlled prices on staple </p><p>  foods; ponderous bureaucratic procedures for </p><p>  clearing donated food through Zimbabwean customs; </p><p>  and limitations on the NGOs permitted to participate </p><p>  in food distribution programs. </p><p> </p><p>  D) The United States has been the principal food </p><p>  donor to Zimbabwe, with generous contributions from </p><p>  the United Kingdom and the European Union. </p><p>  Additional assistance from other donors is needed to </p><p>  meet Zimbabwe\'s food needs. </p><p> </p><p>  E) While Southern Africa\'s drought is a factor in </p><p>  the food crisis, the Government of Zimbabwe needs to </p><p>  face the fact that it also bears responsibility for </p><p>  the situation.  Macroeconomic mismanagement </p><p>  (including deficit spending, a grossly overvalued </p><p>  currency, multiple exchange rates, and unrealistic </p><p>  price controls), a violent and chaotic land </p><p>  redistribution program that has badly damaged the </p><p>  nation\'s agricultural sector, and a disregard for </p><p>  the rule of law that has alienated foreign investors </p><p>  and business, have all played a substantial role in </p><p>  creating conditions under which more than half of </p><p>  all Zimbabweans need food aid. </p><p> </p><p>  F) The United States will not politicize its food </p><p>  assistance to Zimbabwe.  In spite of our serious </p><p>  concerns about the actions and policies of the </p><p>  Zimbabwean government, we will not abandon the </p><p>  people of Zimbabwe at this time of need. </p><p> </p><p>  G) We are working closely with the World Food </p><p>  Program and our bilateral NGO partners to make sure </p><p>  that the food we provide is distributed on a non- </p><p>  partisan basis. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
