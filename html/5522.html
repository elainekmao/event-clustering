<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB AND EUR </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA HINTS TURKEY COULD NOT PURSUE COMPREHENSIVE FTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 0706 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 22326 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  MFA Deputy U/S Alev Kilic told DCM February 4 </p><p>that, while his comments should not be taken as the "final </p><p>word" on the FTA issue,  a U.S.-Turkey Free Trade Agreement </p><p>did not appear to be legally possible within the parameters </p><p>of Turkey\'s Customs Union agreement with the EU.  He </p><p>suggested, however that a "quasi-FTA" or "preferential" trade </p><p>agreement might be possible.  Under such an agreement, Turkey </p><p>could lower tariffs on products on which it had already </p><p>negotiated lower tariffs with the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Per ref B, DCM responded that the USG position was </p><p>clear:  free trade agreements must be "comprehensive," and </p><p>certainly could not exclude agriculture.  He asked for </p><p>clarification of Turkey\'s position.  Kilic said he did not </p><p>have the details, but promised that trade experts would put </p><p>together a technical paper to explain Turkey\'s ideas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3,  (C) Comment:  It may well be that Turkey cannot pursue a </p><p>bilateral FTA.  It is useful and important that we continue </p><p>to put the onus on the GOT to say "no," so that everytime </p><p>Turks complain that we are not doing enough to promote trade </p><p>we can remind them that the decision not to expand trade was </p><p>made in Ankara, not Washington. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
