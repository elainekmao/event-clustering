<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER OFFERS CONDOLENCES - </p><p>ADDRESSES SOME OFR CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) CDA Andrews and PolMilOff 13 September called on Army </p><p>Minister Lawal Batagarawa at the Minister\'s request. </p><p>Batagarawa expressed his condolences for the attacks against </p><p>the United States.  He also stated that he had spoken to the </p><p>Director General of the State Security Service, Kayode Are, </p><p>who had told him that the Embassy had made inquires regarding </p><p>press reports of some Nigerians cheering the attacks in </p><p>Zamfara State.  Batagarwa reassured us that the vast majority </p><p>of Nigerians, including Muslim Nigerians, were horrified by </p><p>Tuesday\'s events, and that these signals of support for </p><p>terrorism against the United States were coming from a very </p><p>small and fringe group of people.  "Islam teaches that what </p><p>happens to your neighbor today can happen to you tomorrow, so </p><p>you should sympathize with his problems," Batagarawa </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Andrews suggested that, with the visit of President </p><p>Obasanjo to Zamfara State underway, this might be a good time </p><p>for Governor Sani to speak out against public demonstrations </p><p>of support for these hateful events.  Batagarawa stated that </p><p>it would be difficult to get that message through to Governor </p><p>Sani during the President\'s visit, but that the Embassy could </p><p>expect to see such a message from the Governor within a week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa noted that he would depart on leave 14 </p><p>September and would return to work on 19 September.  He said </p><p>he would get the OFR MOI back from his Legal Department and </p><p>so he could review and approve it before departing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Minister Batagarawa is an observant Muslim, </p><p>who was clearly disturbed by the reports of small public </p><p>demonstrations of jubilation at the expense of the United </p><p>States.  His assessment that this was an aberration rather </p><p>than a true example of public sentiment matches ours.  The </p><p>U.S. Mission in Nigeria is reassessing its security posture </p><p>on a daily basis.  At this time, however, we have no reason </p><p>to believe that either the unrest in Jos or the recent tragic </p><p>events in the United States will have any spill-over effect </p><p>on Mission personnel, or on those involved in Operation Focus </p><p>Relief.  Governor Aleiro of Kebbi State is in Zamfara for </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s visit, but is expected to return </p><p>tomorrow.  We will endeavor to hear from him directly </p><p>regarding the security situation in Kebbi.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
