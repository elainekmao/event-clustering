<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL COMPLAINT ABOUT FLAG BILLS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In a diplomatic note to the State Department dated </p><p>March 20, the MFA formally asked for assistance to "abolish" </p><p>recent bills by the City Councils of Westminster and Garden </p><p>Grove, California to permit the use of the flag of the </p><p>former Republic of Vietnam and to prevent further such </p><p>legislation at the local and state level.  Text of the </p><p>diplomatic note is in para 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Comment:  unusually, the MFA did not address the </p><p>note to the Embassy nor summon emboff to receive the protest </p><p>in person.  This may be due to what appears to be at least a </p><p>partial freeze in official appointments here due to the </p><p>onset of hostilities in Iraq.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  quote </p><p>(unofficial translation) </p><p> </p><p>No: 118 NG-CM </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of </p><p>Vietnam presents its compliments to the Department of State </p><p>of the United States of America and has the honor to refer </p><p>to the latter the following: </p><p> </p><p>It is known that on the (sic) March 11, 2003, the City </p><p>Council of Garden Grove, State of California, endorsed the </p><p>Res. 8486-03 allowing the flag of the former regime of the </p><p>South of Vietnam to be displayed at public institutions, and </p><p>at public functions of Vietnamese-American community in the </p><p>City of Garden Grove.  At present, considerable efforts are </p><p>being made to instigate other city councils in the State of </p><p>California namely those in Oakland, Hayward, Fremont, San </p><p>Jose . . . to introduce a similar resolution, and at the </p><p>same time, to encourage the State of California\'s Assembly </p><p>to consider and pass a bill in this regard.  Such </p><p>developments have not only been causing great indignation </p><p>among the Government and entire people of Vietnam, but also </p><p>triggered the past of hatred among Vietnamese-American </p><p>community in the U.S., undermining the process of national </p><p>reconciliation and unity of the Vietnamese nation, </p><p>completely running afoul of the current course of our </p><p>bilateral relations in consistence with the common interests </p><p>of the two peoples.  Furthermore, the existence of those </p><p>resolutions will send wrong signals to the U.S. Government\'s </p><p>formal position, in observance of U.S. Laws, to acknowledge </p><p>the National Flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in </p><p>the bilateral diplomatic relations. </p><p> </p><p>The Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam strongly </p><p>opposes and requests the Federal Government and the State </p><p>Department of the United States, for the sake of greater </p><p>interests of the two countries, to take timely, and </p><p>appropriate measures to abolish the wrongful resolutions of </p><p>the City Councils of Westminster and Garden Grove, to </p><p>prevent any similar development wheresoever in the United </p><p>States, and to avert consideration and endorsement of any </p><p>similar bill in this regard by the Assembly of other states. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of </p><p>Vietnam takes this opportunity to renew to the Department of </p><p>State of the United States of America the assurances of its </p><p>highest consideration. </p><p>Hanoi, March 20, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>To:  The Department of State </p><p>The United States of America. </p><p>end quote </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
