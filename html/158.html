<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ALGIERS 02184 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPAL, PREL, KPRP, PLO, AG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALGERIA AND THE PLO </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KPRP 28 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ALGERIA HAS LONG BEEN AN ACTIVE-- </p><p>IF DISTANT--PARTICIPANT IN MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY. </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ARISES FROM ALGERIA\'S SELF-PERCEPTION </p><p>AS ROLE MODEL FOR ALL NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLES </p><p>AND FROM STRONG EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>ARAB/ISLAMIC CAUSE.  POINT OF ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, AND ALGERIA </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO IMPART THE "LESSONS </p><p>LEARNED" FROM ITS OWN STRUGGLE AGAINST COLONIALISM, </p><p>URGING "UNITY" ON THE PALESTINIANS FIRST AND </p><p>FOREMOST. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PLO HAS BEEN A SLOW LEARNER.  PALESTINIANS </p><p>HAVE TRIED MIGHTILY TO IMPOSE "UNITY," BUT HAVE </p><p>LACKED THE RESOURCES AND REACH THAT THE FLN HAD </p><p>IN ITS WAR AGAINST FRANCE.  ALGERIA, NONETHELESS, </p><p>HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ALLY FOR THE PLO, AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS HAVE DERIVED BENEFIT FROM THE GOA\'S </p><p>WIDELY VALUED DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.  ALGIERS HAS ALSO </p><p>SERVED AS A USEFUL VENUE FOR A NUMBER OF PLO ACTI- </p><p>VITIES, MAINLY TRAINING AND LARGE CONGRESSES--SUCH </p><p>AS THE PNC SLATED FOR APRIL 20. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALGERIA, FOR ITS PART, HAS COMPLETED A LONG </p><p>JOURNEY FROM THE REJECTIONIST/STEADFASTNESS FRONT </p><p>APPROACH TO THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE, BUT IT STILL </p><p>VIEWS THE CAMP DAVID APPROACH AS A SELLOUT OF </p><p>ESSENTIAL PALESTINIAN INTERESTS.  BUT, WHILE </p><p>CHAMPIONING THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, ALGERIA HAS </p><p>LEFT UNCLEAR WHAT IT THINKS THE VIABLE SOLUTION </p><p>TO THE ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE COULD BE.  THE GOA REJECTS </p><p>"TERROR" AS A TACTIC, BUT STILL REGARDS  ACTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE "IN THE TERRITORY TO BE LIBERATED" AS </p><p>ACCEPTABLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>TO PNC OR NOT TO PNC </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALGERIA IS PLANNING TO HOST THE PALESTINE </p><p>NATIONAL CONGRESS ON APRIL 20 AFTER A PREPARATORY </p><p>MEETING STARTING APRIL 13.  THESE MEETINGS ARE THE </p><p>RESULT OF MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF INTRICATE, CONFUSING, </p><p>AND OFTEN FRUSTRATING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND PRO- </p><p>TRACTED NEGOTIATIONS WITH NUMEROUS PALESTINIAN FACTIONS </p><p>AND OTHER ARAB STATES.  WHILE ALGERIA WILL BE PLEASED </p><p>IF THERE IS A SUCCESSFUL PNC, THE LONG-TERM GOAL </p><p>REMAINS PUTTING TOGETHER A MORE LASTING UNITY THAT </p><p>WILL ALLOW THE PLO TO PARTICIPATE COHESIVELY IN AN </p><p>ARAB SUMMIT, AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, AND EVENTUAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL. </p><p>ALGERIA\'S DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS HAVE SOUGHT TO COMPOSE </p><p>INTERNAL PALESTINIAN DIFFERENCES, INDUCE SYRIA TO </p><p>PUT ASIDE ITS PAROCHIAL OBJECTIVES AND DISLIKE FOR </p><p>YASSIR ARAFAT, AND SOLICIT SOVIET SUPPORT FOR UNITY </p><p>UNDER ARAFAT.  AT THE SAME TIME, ALGERIA HAS ALSO </p><p>BEEN CAREFUL TO HOLD OUT A GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT </p><p>EGYPT CAN REJOIN THE ARAB COMMUNITY WITHOUT </p><p>ABANDONMENT OF ITS ESSENTIAL INTERESTS.  WITH THESE </p><p>FACTORS TO DEAL WITH, IT WILL BE NO SMALL FEAT IF </p><p>THE PNC ACTUALLY CONVENES APRIL 20. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>HISTORY LESSONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE ALGERIANS CONSIDER THEIR WARTIME EXPERIENCE </p><p>A MODEL FOR LIBERATION MOVEMENTS AND FOR THE PLO </p><p>IN PARTICULAR.  FOR THE ALGERIANS, MAINTAINING </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY UNITY UNDER THE FLN UMBRELLA PREVENTED </p><p>BOTH THE FRENCH AND OTHER ARAB STATES FROM EXPLOITING </p><p>PUBLIC CLEAVAGES TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.  ONCE THE ALGERIANS </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THAT FRANCE COULD HOLD ON NO LONGER IN </p><p>NORTH AFRICA, THE FLN ATTAINED VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS </p><p>OBJECTIVES.  IN URGING THESE LESSONS ON THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE ALGERIANS OVERLOOK ONE KEY FACTOR:  THEIR </p><p>UNITY WAS THE RESULT OF RUTHLESS LIQUIDATION OF ANY </p><p>ELEMENT THOUGHT RECALCITRANT OR INCONVENIENT, FROM </p><p>HARKIS WHO FOUGHT WITH FRANCE TO COMMUNISTS WHO JOINED </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR ANTI-NATIONALIST GOALS.  TRY AS THEY </p><p>MIGHT, THE PALESTINIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE </p><p>UNITY ON THIS BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN DEALING WITH THE PLO, THE ALGERIANS HAVE </p><p>TRIED--WITH VARYING SUCCESS--TO CONVEY A FOUR-PART </p><p>MESSAGE TO THEIR PALESTINIAN FRIENDS: </p><p> </p><p>A)  ALGERIA IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO ADVISE MOVEMENTS </p><p>    ENGAGED IN "NATIONAL LIBERATION" STRUGGLES. </p><p> </p><p>B)  A KEY ELEMENT OF SUCCESS IS CONCEALING INTERNAL </p><p>    DISPUTES BEHIND A FACADE OF UNITY. </p><p> </p><p>C)  NO OUTSIDE POWER CAN BE ALLOWED TO DICTATE GOALS, </p><p>    LEADERSHIP, AND STRATEGY.  THE PALESTINIANS, IN </p><p>    CONTRAST TO THE FLN, HAVE SPLINTERED INTO FACTIONS </p><p>    IDENTIFIED CLOSELY WITH ARAB STATES THAT HAVE </p><p>    SACRIFICED PALESTINIAN INTERESTS FOR THE SAKE </p><p>    OF THEIR OWN PAROCHIAL OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>D)  ALGERIA HAS MAINTAINED CONTACT WITH ALL PALESTINIAN </p><p>    GROUPS FROM THE MAIN-LINE FATAH TO THE EXTREME </p><p>    ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION AND HAS INSISTED THAT </p><p>    UNIFICATION OF ALL FACTIONS, WHATEVER THEIR </p><p>    IDEOLOGY, IS THE ONLY WAY TO ADVANCE THE </p><p>    PALESTINIAN CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN ADDITION TO LESSONS ON HOW TO ORGANIZE A </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY WAR, ALGERIA HAS FURNISHED THE PLO </p><p>MORE TANGIBLE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT. </p><p>AS OF LATE MARCH 1987, ABOUT 600 PALESTINIAN COMBATANTS </p><p>WERE LOCATED WITH THE ALGERIAN MILITARY AT EL-BAYADH, </p><p>A REMOTE SITE ABOUT 600 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF THE </p><p>CAPITAL.  THESE COMBATANTS, WHO ARE REPORTEDLY UNHAPPY </p><p>WITH THEIR LOT IN THE REMOTE DESERT LOCATION, HAD </p><p>MOVED TO EL-BAYADH IN LATE 1986 FROM A CAMP AT </p><p>TEBESSA, NEAR THE TUNISIA FRONTIER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ALGERIA ALSO HOSTS AN OFFICIAL PLO EMBASSY, LED </p><p>BY AN ARAFAT SUPPORTER, AND SMALL LIAISON OFFICES </p><p>FOR SOME OF THE PLO FACTIONS.  ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL, </p><p>THE ALGERIANS HAVE, SINCE THE DEATH OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER BENYAHIA IN 1982, DEALT PUBLICLY WITH THE </p><p>PLO THROUGH THE APPARATUS OF THE RULING PARTY (FLN). </p><p>THE PLO WORKS WITH THE ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ON </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, WITH THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE </p><p>ON MILITARY TRAINING, AND WITH THE FLN ON MATTERS </p><p>OF POLICY.  THE MAIN FIGURES WITHIN THE FLN WHO DEAL </p><p>WITH ALGERIAN-PLO RELATIONS ARE MOHAMMED CHERIF </p><p>MESSAADIA, HEAD OF THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT OF THE </p><p>FLN CENTRAL COMMITTEE, AND HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATE, SADEK </p><p>ZOUATEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY COUNCIL OF FRIENDSHIP </p><p>WITH PEOPLES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CATCHING FLIES WITH HONEY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ZOUATEN AND MESSAADIA TAKE CARE OF VISITING </p><p>PALESTINIAN DELEGATIONS, BUT PRESIDENT BENDJEDID </p><p>ALSO ENGAGES HIMSELF PERSONALLY, RECEIVING MOST </p><p>PALESTINIAN DELEGATIONS, AND HIS POSITION AS FLN </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL ALLOWS THE ALGERIANS TO PRESERVE </p><p>THE FORMS OF PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS.  THE ALGERIANS </p><p>CAREFULLY BALANCE THEIR PROTOCOL TREATMENT OF THE </p><p>VARIOUS GROUPS, ENSURING THAT NONE IS SEEN AS FAVORED. </p><p>WHEN GEORGE HABBASH AND THE PFLP, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE </p><p>AT THEIR MOST INTRANSIGENT ON THEIR CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>ATTENDING ANY REUNIFICATION CONFERENCE, THE ALGERIANS </p><p>BECOME EVEN WARMER AND MORE WELCOMING IN THEIR PUBLIC </p><p>TREATMENT OF HABBASH, SEEKING TO WIN HIM OVER TO WHAT </p><p>IS THE ESSENTIALLY PRO-FATAH VIEW OF THE GOA. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WHILE AVOIDING A PUBLIC BREAK WITH ANY PLO </p><p>FACTION, THE ALGERIANS HAVE ALSO APPLIED DISCREET </p><p>PRESSURE ON ALL GROUPS TO PUT REUNIFICATION ABOVE </p><p>PERSONAL AND FACTIONAL INTERESTS.  PART OF THIS </p><p>PRESSURE IS TO INSTILL AND EXPLOIT A SENSE OF SHAME </p><p>AND PERSONAL OBLIGATION.  BENDJEDID HAS STAKED </p><p>CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CAPITAL ON HIS REUNIFICATION </p><p>INITIATIVE, AND NO PALESTINIAN GROUP WANTS OPENLY </p><p>TO DEFY THE PRESIDENT\'S CALLS FOR UNITY AND BEAR </p><p>THE BLAME FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE ALGERIANS HAVE ALSO TRIED TO PRESSURE SPECIFIC </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO THEY BELIEVE ARE OBSTRUCTING UNITY </p><p>EFFORTS.  IN FEBRUARY 1987, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ALGERIANS </p><p>APPARENTLY GAVE ARAFAT COLD TREATMENT FOR OPPOSING A </p><p>UNITY PLATFORM DURING AN ALGIERS PALESTINIAN WRITERS </p><p>AND JOURNALISTS CONFERENCE.  IN ORDER TO BRING GEORGE </p><p>HABBASH AND THE PFLP INTO THE UNIFICATION TALKS, </p><p>ALGERIA HAS TRIED TO USE WHAT INFLUENCE IT HAS ON </p><p>THAT FACTION\'S SYRIAN BACKERS.  WITH THIS GOAL IN </p><p>MIND, ALGERIA HAS TAKEN A NOTABLY PRO-SYRIAN PUBLIC </p><p>STAND SINCE BENDJEDID\'S JANUARY 23 VISIT TO DAMASCUS </p><p>AND SINCE THE KUWAIT ISLAMIC CONFERENCE SUMMIT.  IN </p><p>SO DOING, ALGIERS HAS HAD TO SWALLOW HARD AND MAINTAIN </p><p>PUBLIC SILENCE OVER SYRIA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE AMAL </p><p>MILITIA IN THE LEBANON CAMPS WAR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>TERRORISM VS. NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  ALGERIA RECOGNIZES THE TERRIBLE DAMAGE THAT </p><p>TERRORISM DOES TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE WITH WESTERN </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION.  YET, DRAWING FROM THEIR OWN STRUGGLE </p><p>AGAINST THE FRENCH, THE ALGERIANS FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT </p><p>USE OF VIOLENCE IS A LEGITIMATE TACTIC AGAINST A </p><p>COLONIZER WHO SHOWS NO SIGN OF GIVING IN TO THE DEMANDS </p><p>OF A "COLONIZED PEOPLE."  ALGERIANS FEEL THE DILEMMA </p><p>ACUTELY--BOTH ON A PHILOSOPHICAL AND A TACTICAL LEVEL-- </p><p>AND HAVE COME UP WITH A LINE OF ARGUMENT THAT CONDEMNS </p><p>TERRORISM, BUT ACCEPTS THE MORAL AND TACTICAL VALIDITY </p><p>OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE TERRITORY TO BE LIBERATED. </p><p>THIS ALLOWS THE GOA TO BE CRITICAL OF TOTALLY REPRE- </p><p>HENSIBLE ACTIONS LIKE RANDOM ATTACKS AT EUROPEAN </p><p>AIRPORTS ON INNOCENT PASSENGERS AND THE ACHILLE LAURO </p><p>AFFAIR, BUT PRESUMABLY LEAVES A DOOR OPEN TO ATTACKS </p><p>ON ISRAEL DIRECTLY.  FOR FEAR OF TYING THEMSELVES </p><p>DOWN OR PREJUDGING ISSUES ON WHICH THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>CANNOT THEMSELVES AGREE, THE ALGERIANS ARE PURPOSE- </p><p>FULLY VAGUE ABOUT WHAT TERRITORY IS TO BE LIBERATED-- </p><p>THE WEST BANK AND GAZA OR ISRAEL ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>14.  BEYOND THE PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE, THE ALGERIANS </p><p>FACE MORE PRACTICAL DILEMMAS IN HOW TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ENGAGE IN TERRORISM. </p><p>THE ACHILLE LAURO DISASTER WAS EASY TO CRITICIZE, </p><p>BUT THEY STILL CONSIDER ABU ABBAS AN IMPORTANT PALES- </p><p>TINIAN LEADER WHO MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN UNITY </p><p>GFFORTS.  THEY CONSIDER ABU NIDAL BEYOND THE PALE, </p><p>A JUDGMENT MADE EASIER BY THE FATAH DEATH SENTENCE </p><p>AGAINST HIM, BUT THE GOA NONETHELESS IS NOT OVERTLY </p><p>HOSTILE TO ABU NIDAL AND PERMITS AT LEAST TWO PALES- </p><p>TINIAN STUDENTS LOYAL TO HIM TO LIVE IN ALGIERS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  WHATEVER THE GOA\'S VIEWS ON THE UTILITY OF </p><p>TERRORISM, ALGERIA\'S BROAD POLICY OF KEEPING DOORS </p><p>OPEN TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE "NATIONAL LIBERATION" </p><p>MOVEMENT OVERRIDES MOST OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.  THE </p><p>GOA SEES ITSELF AS THE WORLD\'S MIDDLEMAN AND RECOG- </p><p>NIZES THAT TO DEAL WITH ALL PARTIES TO DISPUTES, IT </p><p>MUST BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THEM.  AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>NO OTHER COUNTRY COULD HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT ALGERIA </p><p>HAS WITH THE PLO UNITY EFFORT THUS FAR, AN ARGUMENT </p><p>CAN BE MADE IN FAVOR OF THAT OPENNESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>WILL THE REAL ALGERIA PLEASE STAND UP </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  ALGERIA HAS COME A LONG WAY FROM THE DAYS IT </p><p>FORMED THE REJECTIONIST/STEADFASTNESS FRONT WITH THE </p><p>LIKES OF SYRIA, SOUTH YEMEN, AND LIBYA.  WHILE ITS </p><p>VIEWS ON THE ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE HAVE CHANGED </p><p>RADICALLY AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO HAVE ITS NAME </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUE HARDLINERS IS NON-EXISTENT, </p><p>THE GOA HAS BECOME VAGUE ON HOW IT THINKS PEACE CAN </p><p>BE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS </p><p>AND GESTURES LIKE HASSAN\'S MEETINB WITH PERES AT </p><p>IFRANE ARE STILL ROUNDLY CRITICIZED IN THE ALGERIAN </p><p>PRESS.  YET, THE ALGERIANS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY </p><p>NOT TO CRITICIZE THE HUSSEIN/ARAFAT ACCORDS WHEN </p><p>THEY SHOWED PROMISE OF WORKING, AND THEY HAVE MADE </p><p>SOME OVERTURES TO EGYPT, INDICATING THAT THE EGYPTIANS </p><p>CAN EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR WAY BACK INTO THE ARAB </p><p>COMMUNITY ON THEIR OWN TERMS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  SO FAR THE ALGERIANS HAVE CAREFULLY AVOIDED </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN DETAILS OF THE COMPLEX NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>LEADING TO THE PNC MEETING.  WHATEVER THEIR PRIVATE </p><p>FEELINGS ABOUT SPECIFIC ISSUES, THEY HAVE TAKEN NO </p><p>PUBLIC STAND ON THE ABROGATION OF THE AMMAN ACCORD, </p><p>ON PLO TIES WITH EGYPT, ON THE ORGANIZATION OF PLO </p><p>LEADERSHIP, OR ON OTHER DIVISIVE QUESTIONS.  DRAWING </p><p>ON THEIR OWN REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE, THE ALGERIANS </p><p>HAVE SAID ONLY THAT THE PALESTINIANS THEMSELVES MUST </p><p>DECIDE THESE QUESTIONS WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE </p><p>AND THAT PERSONALITIES, EVEN YASIR ARAFAT\'S, SHOULD </p><p>NOT BECOME AN ISSUE THAT OBSCURES REVOLUTIONARY GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PROSPECTS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS FOR ALGERIA AND THE PLO </p><p>RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A)  CAN ALGERIA HOST A PNC MEETING IN APRIL AS PLANNED </p><p>    DESPITE FACTIONAL DISPUTES AMONG THE PALESTINIANS? </p><p> </p><p>B)  IF SO, WILL THE PNC INCLUDE ALL FACTIONS OR WILL </p><p>    IT BE A RUMP SESSION WITHOUT PFLP AND OTHER </p><p>    PRO-SYRIAN PARTICIPATION?  FOR THE ALGERIANS, </p><p>    THE LATTER WOULD REPRESENT ALMOST AS SERIOUS A </p><p>    DIPLOMATIC SETBACK AS A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF </p><p>    THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>C)  WILL THE PNC MEETING ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF UNITY </p><p>    OR WILL IT BE ANOTHER FORUM FOR COMPETING GROUPS </p><p>    AND PERSONALITIES TO AIR THEIR DISPUTES IN PUBLIC? </p><p> </p><p>D)  GIVEN THE COMPETING INFLUENCES AT WORK AMONG THE </p><p>    PALESTINIANS, WHAT WILL BE THE LIFE SPAN OF ANY </p><p>    AGREEMENT REACHED AT THE NEXT PNC? </p><p> </p><p>19.  WHILE ALGERIA RETAINS ITS SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF BRINGING ALL PALESTINIAN FACTIONS TO ALGIERS IN </p><p>LATE APRIL, ITS LONG-TERM GOAL REMAINS RESTORING A </p><p>PLO THAT CAN PRESENT A FACADE OF UNITY, SPEAK WITH </p><p>ONE VOICE ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF PALESTINIAN </p><p>NATIONALISM, AND ATTEND AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE </p><p>AS A COHESIVE GROUP.  AT THE SAME TIME, ALGERIA </p><p>WILL TRY TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS MEDIATOR AND </p><p>DISINTERESTED FRIEND AND TEACHER TO ALL PALESTINIAN </p><p>FACTIONS--A TEACHER WHOSE PRESTIGE AND EXPERIENCE </p><p>SHOULD GUIDE RELUCTANT AND REBELLIOUS STUDENTS ON </p><p>THE CORRECT REVOLUTIONARY PATH.  IF ONLY THEY WOULD </p><p>LISTEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JOHNSTONE </p><p></p></div>
