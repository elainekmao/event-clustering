<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/RPM AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EU, MARR, MK, PREL, NATO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI DISAPPOINTED WITH DELAY IN EU TAKEOVER OF </p><p>ALLIED HARMONY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 57448 B) USNATO 228 C) USNATO 170 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00931  061810Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON MARCH 5, ITALIAN MFA DEPUTY HEAD OF </p><p>MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO EXPRESSED SURPRISE TO </p><p>POLMIN AT THE US INTERVENTION (REF A) DURING THAT MORNING\'S </p><p>NAC IN BRUSSELS DEALING WITH THE EU\'S PROPOSED TAKEOVER OF </p><p>OPERATION ALLIED HARMONY.  RATHER THAN FULLY CONCURRING WITH </p><p>THE END OF THE NATO MISSION AND THE BEGINNING OF AN EU </p><p>MISSION, BISOGNIERO LAMENTED THAT THE UNITED STATES APPEARED </p><p>TO BE REASSESSING THE EU\'S ROLE IN MACEDONIA AND DELAYING </p><p>DISCUSSION OF AN EU ROLE IN BOSNIAN SECURITY UNTIL THE END OF </p><p>2003.  GIOVANNI BRAUZZI, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA NATO AFFAIRS </p><p>OFFICE, STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT PLAYING INTO THE HANDS </p><p>OF "OTHERS" WHO SAY THE U.S. HAS MISGIVINGS OVER ESDP.  IN A </p><p>FOLLOW UP CONVERSATION WITH BISOGNIERO, POLMIN UNDERLINED </p><p>THAT OUR CONCERNS HAD BEEN RAISED CONSISTENTLY BY USNATO AT </p><p>VARIOUS MEETINGS IN BRUSSELS, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT THE </p><p>ITALIAN MISSION BY SURPRISE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BISOGNIERO, IT APPEARED AS IF THE U.S. </p><p>WAS REASSESSING THE EU\'S POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF THE MACEDONIA </p><p>MISSION.  READING FROM MEETING NOTES, BISOGNIERO NOTED WITH </p><p>PUZZLEMENT THE ASSERTION FROM THE U.S. SIDE THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>PREMATURE TO DISCUSS PASSING RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOSNIAN </p><p>SECURITY FROM SFOR TO THE EU BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED THE GOI\'S CONCERN THAT SMALL DETAILS WERE NOW </p><p>THREATENING TO STOP A PROCESS THAT WAS IN THE COMMON INTEREST </p><p>OF ITALY AND THE US.  BISOGNIERO ALSO STATED THAT HE HAD </p><p>BELIEVED THERE WERE ONLY TWO ISSUES PENDING -- THE RELEASE OF </p><p>NATO ASSETS TO THE EU AND MODALITIES FOR A POSSIBLE NATO </p><p>INTERVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00931  061810Z </p><p>3. (C)  POLMIN EMPHASIZED THAT OTHER ALLIES, NOT JUST THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, WERE BEING CAUTIOUS IN DISCUSSING THE EU </p><p>TAKEOVER OF SFOR IN BOSNIA.  MACEDONIA IS A RELATIVELY SMALL </p><p>JOB COMPARED TO BOSNIA.  BISOGNIERO NOTED THAT THE GOI HAD </p><p>NOT TABLED ANYTHING RELATED TO BOSNIA, AND WAS WELL AWARE OF </p><p>ITS GREATER COMPLICATIONS.  HAVING ALWAYS TRIED TO HARMONIZE </p><p>EU DEFENSE POLICY WITH NATO, THE GOI WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>THE MARCH 5 MEETING, WHICH THEY HAD EXPECTED TO CONFIRM THE </p><p>EU\'S ASSUMPTION OF ALLIED HARMONY FROM NATO, WITH FULL U.S. </p><p>CONCURRENCE, HAD NOT PRODUCED THE DESIRED OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  BRAUZZI STATED THAT HE HAD THOUGHT ALL THE DETAILS OF </p><p>THE HANDOVER WERE FINISHED, AND RAISED TWO POINTS: THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE EU\'S FIRST MISSION GOING WELL; AND THAT THE </p><p>U.S. SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF "OTHERS" </p><p>(READ FRENCH) WHO SAY THE U.S. HAS MISGIVINGS OVER ESDP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN A FOLLOW UP CONVERSATION WITH BISOGNIERO, </p><p>COUNTRYMAN EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOI SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>SURPRISED THAT AMBASSADOR BURNS HAD LAID OUT US CONCERNS AT </p><p>THE NAC.  USNATO HAD CONSISTENTLY STRESSED IN VARIOUS FORA </p><p>THE NEED TO AVOID MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MACEDONIA, LET </p><p>ALONE TO LEAPFROG TO THE LARGER BOSNIA MISSION, BEFORE TAKING </p><p>CARE OF THE BERLIN PLUS ARRANGEMENTS (REFS B, C).  FURTHER, </p><p>THE CONDITIONS FOR THE MACEDONIA OPERATION LAID OUT BY THE </p><p>U.S. IN BRUSSELS WERE REASONABLE AND ACHIEVABLE WITHIN A </p><p>RELATIVELY SHORT TIMEFRAME.  IT WOULD ONLY BE WISE TO SEE HOW </p><p>IT GOES IN MACEDONIA BEFORE MAKING DEFINITE DECISIONS ON A </p><p>BOSNIA MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: IT\'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE ITALIANS WERE SUPRISED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00931  061810Z </p><p>BY THE US POSITION IN YESTERDAY\'S NAC, BUT ..... THEY WERE. </p><p>THIS APPROACH BY BISOGNIERO SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS A </p><p>COMPLAINT ABOUT OUR POSITION, BUT INSTEAD AS A DESIRE TO BE </p><p>KEPT CLOSELY INFORMED. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00931 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
