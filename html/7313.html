<p>UNCLAS ROME 001534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CIP - TFINTON; </p><p>COMMERCE FOR NTIA/GALLAGHER/SPECK; USDOC FOR </p><p>4220/MAC/EUR/SED/DDEFALCO; FCC FOR AGOMEZ AND ATHOMAS; </p><p>JUSTICE FOR CWILLNER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ECON, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY -- WIRELESS INTERNET SURVEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 85946 </p><p> </p><p>B. ROME 1084 </p><p> </p><p>1. WI-FI HAS BEEN SLOW TO GET OFF THE GROUND IN ITALY, </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGED DURING THE </p><p>MARCH 6-7TH U.S/ITALY BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS ON </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS. MINISTRY OFFICIALS HAVE PUBLICLY </p><p>CRITICIZED THE COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY (ITALY\'S FCC </p><p>EQUIVALENT) FOR THE DELAY IN THE ISSUANCE OF WI-FI RELATED </p><p>REGULATIONS. AUTHORITY OFFICIALS TOLD US ON APRIL 7 THAT THEY </p><p>WILL SOON ISSUE REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE OF R-LAN -- RADIO </p><p>LOCAL AREA NETWORKS -- EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING THE MARCH 6-7TH BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS, BOTH </p><p>MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY OFFICIALS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>INTERFERENCE OF WI-FI SYSTEMS WITH 2G AND 3G MOBILE SYSTEMS </p><p>(REFTEL B). THE U.S. DELEGATION, WHICH WAS HEADED BY </p><p>AMBASSADOR DAVID GROSS OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, REPLIED THAT, </p><p>WHILE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND U.S. INDUSTRY INITIALLY HAD </p><p>THOSE CONCERNS, NOW BOTH PARTIES SEE SYSTEMS AS </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY. TELECOM COMPANIES, U.S. DELEGATES NOTED, SEE </p><p>WI-FI AS PART OF A BUNDLE OF SERVICES THAT INCLUDES 2G AND 3G </p><p>CAPABILITIES.  NOTING THAT THE 2.4 MHZ BAND IS USED MORE IN </p><p>ITALY THAN IN THE U.S., MINISTRY OFFICIALS UNDERSCORED THAT </p><p>SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION OF FREQUENCIES WILL BE </p><p>EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO AVOID INTERFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. ITALY HAS ALLOCATED UNLICENSED RADIO-FREQUENCY SPECTRUM </p><p>FOR USE BY WI-FI AND SIMILAR WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES BOTH FOR </p><p>PRIVATE AND PUBLIC USE. UNDER ITALY\'S FREQUENCY ALLOCATION </p><p>SCHEME (PNRF - PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPARTIZIONE DELLE </p><p>FREQUENZE), THE USE OF R-LAN SYSTEMS FOR WI-FI IS ALLOWED, IN </p><p>THESE FREQUENCY BANDS: 2,400.0 - 2,483.5 MHZ (2.4 GHZ BAND), </p><p>5,150 - 5,350 MHZ, 5,470 - 5,725 MHZ (5 GHZ BAND). FOR </p><p>PRIVATE USE, SYSTEMS AT 2.4 GHZ CAN BE FREELY USED WITHOUT </p><p>ANY FORM OF AUTHORIZATION IN INDOOR PREMISES; AUTHORIZATION </p><p>IS NEEDED FOR OUTDOOR USAGE. OPERATORS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR </p><p>AUTHORIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. TELECOM ITALIA OFFERS INDOOR WI-FI SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. </p><p>SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE OFFERING OUTSIDE WI-FI SERVICES IN </p><p>ITALY. MEGABEAM, WHICH WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED BY TELECOM </p><p>ITALIA FOR ABOUT 11.5 MILLION EUROS, HAS CREATED HOT SPOTS IN </p><p>THE ROME AND MILAN AIRPORTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS MEETING ROOMS </p><p>IN HOTELS IN ROME AND MILAN. WITH FAIRLY HIGH PRICES (115 </p><p>EUROS PER MONTH), THE SERVICE IS FOCUSED ON BUSINESS </p><p>TRAVELERS.  TELECOM ITALIA PLANS A RAPID EXPANSION FOR WI-FI, </p><p>AT FIRST PRIMARILY IN TRAIN STATIONS, AIRPORTS, CONFERENCE </p><p>CENTERS, AND HOTELS.  AIRGATE, AN ITALIAN COMPANY, IS </p><p>PLANNING TO BUILD A NATIONAL WI-FI NETWORK CALLED "SPAGHETTI </p><p>WIRELESS", BASED ON SEATTLE\'S "SEATTLE WIRELESS."  THE CITY </p><p>OF PADUA IS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A CITY-WIDE WI-FI </p><p>NETWORK.  IT HAS EIGHT NODES, OF WHICH SIX ARE OPERATIONAL, </p><p>AND IS PLANNING ON TWELVE MORE THROUGHOUT THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. POST WILL REPORT ON REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE OF R-LAN </p><p>UPON THEIR PUBLICATION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>2003ROME01534 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
