<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: SE RAZALI TO MEET WITH ASSK </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 665 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  UN Special Envoy Razali gave COM a private </p><p>read-out of his meeting this morning, June 9, with Vice </p><p>Senior General Maung Aye.  Maung Aye told Razali that "as a </p><p>special consideration" to the UN and Razali\'s efforts, the </p><p>SPDC had reversed a previous decision to not allow anyone </p><p>access to Aung San Suu Kyi, and Razali could see her June 10 </p><p>at 10:00 in the morning at an undisclosed location.  The only </p><p>conditions on the visit were that Razali cannot divulge where </p><p>the meeting takes place and he must be brief in speaking with </p><p>her.  When Razali asked when ASSK would be released, Maung </p><p>Aye responded, "As soon as it is possible."  Razali is </p><p>briefing the diplomatic corps on these developments just </p><p>prior to his visit to ASSK on June 10, and then leaving on a </p><p>flight to Singapore at noon at the request of the SPDC.  He </p><p>said he would not provide this information to any other </p><p>members of the diplomatic corps except the Japanese </p><p>Ambassador until the morning briefing.  COM said she would </p><p>alert Washington but otherwise keep the information </p><p>close-hold. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Special Envoy Razali briefed COM privately this </p><p>afternoon (June 9) on his meeting earlier this morning with </p><p>SPDC Vice Senior General Maung Aye.  This was Razali\'s first </p><p>substantive meeting with the SPDC number two and he said it </p><p>went quite well.  Razali said it was interesting to see the </p><p>dynamics in the meeting, with Maung Aye relaxed and clearly </p><p>in charge.  Maung Aye told Razali he was aware of the </p><p>situation, Razali\'s efforts, and (interestingly) PM </p><p>Mahathir\'s concerns.  He told Razali that "as a special </p><p>consideration" to the UN and to Razali\'s efforts, the request </p><p>to grant him access to ASSK had been reviewed by "the </p><p>organization" and it was decided to reverse a previous </p><p>decision to bar all access to her.  (Note:  Neither Razali </p><p>nor post has ever heard of "the organization" before.  Razali </p><p>said he plans to follow-up with the Foreign Minister to get a </p><p>better understanding of what it refers to.  This could be a </p><p>term for an SPDC policy council or a smaller subset of key </p><p>decision-makers.  End Note.)  Maung Aye said Khin Nyunt would </p><p>provide Razali with the details of the meeting and began to </p><p>excuse himself.  In an effort to get a commitment for future </p><p>meetings with Maung Aye, Razali noted how useful it had been </p><p>to talk to him and said he hoped to meet with him in the </p><p>future; he said Maung Aye just smiled.  Finally, Razali asked </p><p>Maung Aye when ASSK would be released.  Maung Aye gave the </p><p>enigmatic reply, "As soon as it is possible." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Khin Nyunt then took Maung Aye\'s chair and brought </p><p>out a book with handwritten details on how the visit to ASSK </p><p>would be handled.  He told Razali that he would be taken to a </p><p>military headquarters where he would meet Brigadier General </p><p>Than Tun (the military intelligence officer normally assigned </p><p>as a liaison to ASSK).  The two of them would go together to </p><p>another location to meet her.  Khin Nyunt told Razali that </p><p>the two conditions for the meeting would be that Razali could </p><p>not divulge the location of the meeting to anyone and that he </p><p>had to keep the meeting brief.  Khin Nyunt added that Razali </p><p>"should not be concerned by the location where they meet" </p><p>because ASSK would be brought there for the meeting from </p><p>another location.  Finally, Khin Nyunt asked Razali how long </p><p>he planned to remain in Rangoon.  When Razali said he was </p><p>flexible depending how things were progressing, Khin Nyunt </p><p>suggested that he leave on the 12:15 P.M. Silkair flight to </p><p>Singapore right after his meeting with ASSK.  Razali said he </p><p>was a little taken aback by this, but he agreed.  (Note: </p><p>Razali said he would provide Poloff with information on the </p><p>ASSK meeting at the airport, if possible.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  COM asked if Razali had brought up the condition of U </p><p>Tin Oo or other NLD members and supporters that have been </p><p>detained and reportedly injured.  Razali said he had not </p><p>raised this, preferring to focus on ASSK first and foremost. </p><p>He said he would be meeting with the Foreign Minister later </p><p>in the day and planned to discuss access to other detainees, </p><p>the steps necessary to get national reconciliation back on </p><p>track, and the decision-making process of the junta.  Razali </p><p>said it was fascinating to see how relaxed and confident </p><p>Maung Aye was and how Khin Nyunt was clearly in a subservient </p><p>role in Maung Aye\'s presence.  Most significantly, he felt, </p><p>was that there was no mention of Senior General Than Shwe </p><p>during the meeting.  Razali said it was clear to him that he </p><p>will need to engage with Maung Aye to a greater degree in </p><p>order to move forward with his mission. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
