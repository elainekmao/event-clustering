(C )  Summary:  President Obasanjo\'s renomination is highly </p><p>probable but not certain. The 3,349 delegates to the ruling </p><p>PDP\'s national convention began voting around sundown, but </p><p>the process could drag into Monday morning. On convention </p><p>eve, the President\'s renomination seemed assured (Ref A). </p><p>However, his strategy of alliance with the governors lost </p><p>its legs when most Southeastern and South-South Governors </p><p>turned on him. Other governors joined in. At one point, 16 </p><p>of the 21 PDP governors were estimated to have shifted </p><p>allegiance, with former Vice President Alex Ekwueme the </p><p>beneficiary. By Saturday morning most observers gave </p><p>Ekwueme the inside track. That entire day transformed into </p><p>an endless stream of meetings in numerous locations, with </p><p>key players moving about, facilely proposing deals and </p><p>making promises to advance their interests. Alternatively </p><p>cajoling and arm-twisting governors and delegates, Obasanjo </p><p>slowly recovered ground. VP Atiku Abubakar\'s decision not </p><p>to jump ship stalled the rebellious governors\' momentum. </p><p>By Sunday morning, relieved Presidential advisors claimed </p><p>to have the Governors back in line. While Atiku may have </p><p>wanted to abandon Obasanjo, he feared the consequences of </p><p>openly challenging his President. The PDP will emerge from </p><p>this convention even more profoundly divided than it was </p><p>going in. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Going into the convention, Obasanjo believed his </p><p>re-nomination was assured.  Despite a strong challenge by </p><p>former Vice President Alex Ekwueme (Chairman of the PDP </p><p>Board of Trustees and a founding member of the party), </p><p>Obasanjo and his advisors were confident.  Party apparatus </p><p>in ANPP- and AD-controlled states was firmly behind the </p><p>President.  He had met with PDP Governors (who in most </p><p>cases exercise great influence over their delegations) </p><p>December 30 and thought he had their support.  At that </p><p>meeting, Obasanjo distanced himself from reports that he </p><p>wanted to disqualify some Governors from contesting in the </p><p>general elections despite their having "won" (ref C) </p><p>renomination. Obasanjo promised that his "incumbents pact" </p><p>with the Governors remained solid. However, the harmony of </p><p>that meeting began to dissipate when, soon after returning </p><p>home, the governors started receiving reports from inside </p><p>the Presidency that Obasanjo had lied to secure their </p><p>support: he still intended to push the PDP to jettison some </p><p>governors after he secured the nomination. Faced with </p><p>Obasanjo\'s presumed insincerity, South-South governors met </p><p>Thursday night, deciding the best way to protect their </p><p>seats was to attack Obasanjo\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The South-South Governors\' anger was also stoked by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s failure to sign the amended oil dichotomy bill </p><p>(septel), the hot button issue in their region. Two of the </p><p>leaders of this gubernatorial insurrection were Delta\'s </p><p>James Ibori and Edo\'s Lucky Igbinedion. Ironically, when </p><p>they had thought Obasanjo would sign the bill, this same </p><p>duo had proposed during a PDP National Executive Committee </p><p>(NEC) meeting in November that Obasanjo be renominated "by </p><p>consensus" by the NEC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) It was not hard to entice other governors onto the </p><p>anti-Obasanjo wagon. Southeastern Governors had their own </p><p>grievances.  Moreover, there was the long-standing </p><p>agitation for an Igbo candidate. With former Vice-President </p><p>Ekwueme now the main challenger, these Igbo Governors were </p><p>under pressure at home to support this ethnic favorite son. </p><p>A special assistant to Abia State Governor Kalu told us </p><p>that Kalu\'s presidential aspirations for 2007 made him </p><p>ambivalent about fellow Igbo Ekwueme taking the 2003 PDP </p><p>nomination. Ekwueme\'s ascendance would virtually dash any </p><p>hope of Kalu gaining the Presidency as the rotation would </p><p>not return to the Southeast for over twenty years. However, </p><p>after having been the most vocal advocate for an Igbo </p><p>president, Kalu\'s greatest fear was being branded a crass </p><p>hypocrite if he failed to back Ekwueme. By the time the </p><p>convention began on Saturday morning, several northern </p><p>Governors, including Adamawa\'s Boni Haruna, Vice President </p><p>Atiku\'s acolyte, had joined the rebel camp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Although the governors had decided to oppose the </p><p>President, they had not by early Saturday morning decided </p><p>whom to back. Some of them wanted to put two of their own </p><p>number against the incumbents (an idea they had reportedly </p><p>considered prior to the December 30 meeting). This concept </p><p>never took hold because of disagreement over composition of </p><p>the ticket. Also, it was clear that a role had to be found </p><p>for Ekwueme. The governors then asked the VP to contest </p><p>against Obasanjo, according to Atiku\'s special advisor. </p><p>The Advisor said Atiku offered to take the governors\' </p><p>advice but only if they publicly and unequivocally called </p><p>for Atiku\'s candidacy before he left the President. The </p><p>advisor claimed the Governors\' rejection of Obasanjo was </p><p>driven by the President\'s unpopularity. They feared he </p><p>would not only would lose his general election but would </p><p>take them down with him. As of late Saturday, however, the </p><p>advisor thought the governors would back Ekwueme and that </p><p>he would win the nomination; to restore some party unity in </p><p>the wake of a divisive fight, Ekwueme would name Atiku as </p><p>the Vice-Presidential candidate and Atiku would accept. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO BATTLES BACK </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Jarred by the prospect of humiliating defeat, </p><p>Obasanjo began to act more like a politician than a </p><p>potentate on Saturday. With Atiku in tow, he made the </p><p>rounds to visit state delegations and even to confer with </p><p>influential individual delegates. For instance, to the </p><p>important South-South delegates, he promised to reverse his </p><p>stance and sign the oil dichotomy bill next week. He also </p><p>moved decisively to reconcile with the governors, lunching </p><p>with them as a group, later visiting individually with </p><p>several. There were plausible but unconfirmed reports of </p><p>money changing hands. Obasanjo and his minions also used </p><p>strong-arm tactics. Part of his not-so-gentle suasion with </p><p>the governors was the threat to dedicate the powers of his </p><p>office to scuttle the reelection of those who did not </p><p>support him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Obasanjo even swallowed his pride by asking to meet </p><p>the leadership of the National Assembly, the den of some of </p><p>his staunchest opponents. Reportedly, Assembly members were </p><p>told the President would open the pork barrel by releasing </p><p>funds for "constituency projects" in exchange for support. </p><p>By Sunday morning, Obasanjo\'s overtures seemed to have some </p><p>effect. Key Obasanjo allies were smiling, confident most </p><p>governors had returned to the fold. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>EKWUEME TRIES TO HOLD ON </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Having lost at the last minute to Obasanjo at the </p><p>in 1999 convention, Ekwueme was doing his best to repay </p><p>Obasanjo in the same coin. Ekwueme actively lobbied </p><p>Governors and delegations. He also engaged the other </p><p>presidential contestants, Barnabas Gemade and Abubakar </p><p>Rimi, reportedly offering each the Vice-Presidency in </p><p>exchange for their support. (Rimi probably controls about </p><p>200 votes; Gemade might have 50.). However, Ekwueme\'s most </p><p>serious attentions were directed toward Vice President </p><p>Atiku, whose influence over the party faithful could swing </p><p>several hundred delegates and sway the thinking of the </p><p>governors. Ekwueme made several attempts to meet Atiku, who </p><p>demurred, fearing Obasanjo\'s reaction to such a meeting at </p><p>such a tense moment. Working through intermediaries, </p><p>Ekwueme offered the second slot on his ticket to Atiku. </p><p>Media reports allege that Ekwueme offered, should they win </p><p>the general election, to resign as President in 2006 so </p><p>that Atiku could run as an incumbent in 2007. However, an </p><p>Ekwueme insider denied his candidate made such a desperate </p><p>proposal. He stated the proposal surfaced from Atiku\' side; </p><p>but to protect their boss\'s flank from Obasanjo\'s anger, </p><p>Atiku\'s men attributed the idea to Ekwueme. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO ATIKU </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Because of his influence over individual delegates </p><p>and governors in his PDM faction of the party, Atiku may </p><p>determine the final direction the convention\'s wind blows. </p><p>In some ways, his is an enviable position; but from another </p><p>angle, it is akin to walking a minefield. The pressure on </p><p>him not to make a misstep is intense. The ambitious yet </p><p>cautious Atiku would like the presidential nomination. </p><p>However, Atiku dare not challenge Obasanjo directly, </p><p>knowing Obasanjo would use the tools of the Presidency to </p><p>destroy Atiku for what Obasanjo would see as a monumental </p><p>betrayal. Both prior to the convention and into the early </p><p>hours of its second day, Atiku obviously was groping for </p><p>some device or pretext that would enable him to separate </p><p>from Obasanjo without being accused of having scuttled the </p><p>President\'s re-nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Governor\'s eleventh hour insurgency momentarily </p><p>must have seen like the answer.  Publicly, Atiku announced </p><p>he stood with Obasanjo but his assistants were busy talking </p><p>to the President\'s opponents. Moreover, the Atiku\'s public </p><p>statement of loyalty was less than ringing, and observers </p><p>knew that Adamawa Governor Haruna would never have joined </p><p>the rebellion without his mentor\'s approval.  However, what </p><p>first seemed like a gift became a millstone around the </p><p>Vice-Presidential neck. Obasanjo put Atiku on the spot by </p><p>making sure that Atiku joined his efforts to regain </p><p>gubernatorial support. The more Atiku was seen helping </p><p>Obasanjo, the more Atiku\'s potential supporters in the </p><p>anti-Obasanjo camp pressured him. Some of his followers </p><p>threatened to abandon him unless he joined Ekwueme or </p><p>challenged Obasanjo outright. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Jumping from Obasanjo\'s ship to Ekwueme\'s was not </p><p>ultimately very attractive to Atiku. First, there was that </p><p>little problem of Obasanjo feeling betrayed and then acting </p><p>on those feelings; it is generally believed that Obasanjo </p><p>has sufficient evidence of Atiku\'s corrupt practices to </p><p>ruin the man. Second, Atiku does not fully trust Ekwueme. </p><p>Former Head of State Babangida and probably National </p><p>Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed, two of Atiku\'s political </p><p>rivals in the North, are reportedly backing Ekwueme. Atiku </p><p>has to be concerned that, at Babangida\'s urging, Ekwueme </p><p>might dump him once the PDP nomination was secured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) When not pounding the turf with Obasanjo, Atiku </p><p>spent the remainder of Saturday with allies and aides </p><p>discussing how to walk his tightrope. By Sunday morning, </p><p>Atiku had apparently decided, for better or worse, that he </p><p>was married to Obasanjo and that Ekwueme was not a </p><p>sufficiently strong suitor to steal him from a jealous </p><p>spouse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BUYING TIME </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Obasanjo used influence over the party machinery, </p><p>especially party Chairman Ogbeh, to buy precious additional </p><p>hours on Saturday. Delegate accreditation was scheduled for </p><p>Saturday afternoon. However, PDP officials in charge of the </p><p>process were Obasanjo loyalists. Sensing the momentum had </p><p>shifted to Ekwueme, they slowed accreditation of delegates. </p><p>While the voting was not set until Sunday in any event, the </p><p>accreditation delay pushed the start of balloting from late </p><p>morning to early evening, giving the Presidency some extra </p><p>time to canvas for support. It also provided the psychic </p><p>benefit of regaining control of what had seemed to be a </p><p>runaway train, denting Ekwueme supporters psychologically. </p><p>Some of them began to lament Obasanjo that had the tools to </p><p>orchestrate his victory regardless of the delegate count. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE VOTE AND ITS UNCERTAINTY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) With Atiku and most governors back in the fold, it </p><p>appears Obasanjo has regained the momentum and probably the </p><p>lead. However, the vote tonight will be by secret ballot </p><p>(sort of -- delegates will vote individually but must place </p><p>a thumbprint on the ballot). Since their votes cannot be </p><p>definitively attributed without thumbprint analysis, </p><p>delegate behavior will be hard to predict. No one has done </p><p>an accurate poll of the individual delegates. The working </p><p>assumption has been that the delegates will follow their </p><p>governor\'s lead.  While that may have been true coming into </p><p>the convention, it may not be quite as valid now.  The </p><p>governors\' initial defiance opened the way to delegates to </p><p>assert their own independence. With the cork now off, it </p><p>will be hard to put all the delegates back in the bottle. </p><p>Most of the delegates we talked to favored Ekwueme. It is </p><p>uncertain whether the governors can make most of them </p><p>change course at this point.  The delegates have been </p><p>talking to each other, and this has given them a power and </p><p>momentum of their own. Also, we cannot gauge how committed </p><p>the Governors are to their supposed reconciliation with </p><p>Obasanjo. If the reconciliation was just superficial, then </p><p>they might not try hard to instill voting discipline among </p><p>their delegates.  The Obasanjo camp\'s claim that victory is </p><p>certain is based on the false tally that the pro-Obasanjo </p><p>governors will carry all their delegates. We think the </p><p>actually voting will be more complicated and ambiguous. </p><p>Obasanjo will probably win a first-ballot victory, but the </p><p>overwhelming 75%-plus first-ballot vote of confidence some </p><p>in his camp are predicting may well escape him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Gemade and Rimi, while neither has a chance, also </p><p>are wild cards. Between them, they might control up to 300 </p><p>delegates. If they get the higher figure and Ekwueme holds </p><p>onto anti-Obasanjo delegates, Obasanjo might even be denied </p><p>a first-round victory. Should that happen, the struggle for </p><p>their second-round support would be intense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A FRACTURED PARTY? </p><p>------------------ </p><p>16.  (C) The winner will face a party riven by factionalism </p><p>and the contention of this convention. Large sums are said </p><p>to have been spent to cajole delegates (between 20 and 60 </p><p>million USD, according to most estimates), and the loser\'s </p><p>backers will have to be compensated if they are to return </p><p>to the PDP fold and support the winner in April\'s general </p><p>election. Also, Obasanjo reportedly made promises (e.g., to </p><p>sign a bill that would give coastal states at least 13% of </p><p>the federal revenue derived from oil wells out to 200 NM) </p><p>to secure support from one part of the country (South- </p><p>South) that will not sit will with those states (all others </p><p>except Ondo and Lagos) whose shares of the future revenue </p><p>pie will thereby be reduced proportionately. Assuming he </p><p>emerges victorious from the convention, Obasanjo will have </p><p>to work furiously to ensure that he can legitimately win at </p><p>least one-third of the popular vote in not less than 25 </p><p>states and to prevent mass defections to other parties. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
