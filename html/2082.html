During an October 16 meeting with Nigeria\'s Attorney </p><p>General and Minister of Justice Bola Ige, the Ambassador </p><p>learned that Nigeria had nominated Ige for a seat on the </p><p>International Law Commission (ILC) and has been lobbying for </p><p>his candidacy for several months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Ige, 71, has been Attorney General and Minister of Justice </p><p>since June 2000.  He has held numerous judicial and political </p><p>offices in his career, including Governor of Oyo State </p><p>(1979), Minister of Power and Steel in the current </p><p>government, and several commissioner positions in the </p><p>now-defunct Western state (1960s-70s).  A Senior Advocate of </p><p>Nigeria (SAN), he has practiced law widely throughout </p><p>Nigeria.  He holds a leading member of the Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD)- one of Nigeria\'s three political parties - </p><p>and is the deputy leader of "Afenifere," the Pan-Yoruba </p><p>cultural association.  Though formally a member of the </p><p>opposition, he is close to resident Obasanjo whme he has know </p><p>since the 1960s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The Mission deals with Ige on a wide array of law </p><p>enforcement and judicial issues. We find him to be one of our </p><p>most capable and impressive interlocutors.  Ige is highly and </p><p>broadly respected here.  We recommend the USG support his </p><p>candidacy for the ILC.  If the USG can vote for him in the </p><p>upcoming November 8 election at the UNGA, we should. We </p><p>strongly endorse him based on his qualifications, influence </p><p>and character. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Action request for IO and AF: Please advise USG position </p><p>on Ige\'s candidacy.  End action request. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
