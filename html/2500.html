<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: ONE FEARED DEAD IN BOMB EXPLOSION, ARSON AT </p><p>KATHMANDU LAND REVENUE OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>REF(S):  (A)  KATHMANDU 0340; (B) 01 KATHMANDU 2331 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Suspected Maoists set fire to files and set off </p><p>a timed explosive device at a Kathmandu Land Revenue </p><p>Office a little after 10:00 a.m. on February 15.  Four </p><p>people, including a police officer attempting to </p><p>extinguish the fire were injured.  Embassy has heard </p><p>unconfirmed reports that at least one of the injured </p><p>subsequently died in the hospital of his injuries. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) According to our most recent information, about </p><p>three or four individuals, at least one armed with a </p><p>pistol, entered the Land Revenue Office a little after </p><p>10:00 a.m., the start of the business day in Nepal. </p><p>While the armed individual held occupants of the office </p><p>at bay, the other intruders poured kerosene or another </p><p>accelerant on land records and other files and ignited </p><p>them.  Before leaving the office, the intruders set a </p><p>timed improvised device made with gelatine explosives, </p><p>which detonated shortly thereafter. The Land Revenue </p><p>Office is located a little more than one kilometer from </p><p>the USAID Mission and Lincoln International School, </p><p>which most dependent children in the Mission attend. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Land Revenue offices and other </p><p>outposts of central government authority have long been </p><p>favorite Maoist targets in the hinterlands.  This most </p><p>recent incident and the Feb. 11 bombing of a Kathmandu </p><p>tax office (Ref A) indicate the Maoists are bringing the </p><p>fight out of the districts and into the capital.  Bombs </p><p>have been set off in the capital before, but most, like </p><p>the bomb at the Coca-Cola facility (Ref B), were set </p><p>outside of working hours.  (The December 3 bombing that </p><p>killed two at a Kathmandu carpet factory is an </p><p>exception.)  That the Maoists are now willing to carry </p><p>out such attacks during working hours--and that they can </p><p>slip by the heightened security cordon around the city </p><p>with explosive devices and arms in broad daylight--marks </p><p>a disturbing new development in this seven-year-old </p><p>insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
