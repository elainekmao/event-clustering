<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 005125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY, LE, IT, SY, LE, IT, IZ, IZPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MFA ON LEBANON-ISRAEL WATER ISSUE, SYRIA, </p><p>AND PEACE PROCESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05125  01 OF 02  212149Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: MFA REPORTS THAT THE ITALIAN WATER EXPERT </p><p>CURRENTLY WORKING THE ISRAELI-LEBANESE WATER DISPUTE MAY SEEK </p><p>TO HELP BROKER A LONGER-TERM, BROADER SHARING AGREEMENT, BUT </p><p>AS AN EU INITIATIVE, NOT AN ITALIAN EFFORT.  ROME RECEIVED </p><p>THE PITCH FROM LEBANESE FINANCE MINISTER SINIORA ON THE EU </p><p>GUARANTEEING BONDS FOR LEBANON.  SYRIAN FM AL-SHAR\'A LEFT </p><p>OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SYRIA FIGHTING IRAQ IF SADDAM STRIKES </p><p>ANOTHER ARAB STATE.  ITALY IS PREPARED TO PROPOSE A CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR EU SPECIAL ENVOY IF MORATINOS STEPS DOWN.  THE GOI TURNED </p><p>DOWN A SAUDI DEMARCHE ASKING FOR A STATEMENT CONDEMNING </p><p>RECENT US LEGISLATION ON JERUSALEM.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ON THE ISRAEL/PALESTINE WATER DISPUTE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) LUCA FERRARI, EASTERN MED OFFICE DIRECTOR, TOLD POLMC </p><p>AND NEA WATCHER THAT MAZZITTI, THE EU WATER EXPERT, AN </p><p>ITALIAN, WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN IN RECENT MEETINGS IN THE </p><p>REGION THAT THE ISRAELIS WERE NOT AUTOMATICALLY NEGATIVE ON </p><p>THE IDEA OF AN EU ROLE IN HELPING TO MONITOR AND POSSIBLY </p><p>NEGOTIATE, IN THE LONGER TERM, AN ACCORD ON WATER SHARING. </p><p>THE EXPERT\'S EFFORTS ARE AND WILL REMAIN AN EU AFFAIR.  THE </p><p>GOI HAS NO INTENTIONS TO BECOME INVOLVED BILATERALLY, NOR TO </p><p>PAY FOR PUMPS OR METERS, ADDED FERRARI. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ROME HOSTED OCTOBER 7 THE LEBANESE FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05125  01 OF 02  212149Z </p><p>FUAD SINIORA, WHO PRESENTED PM HARIRI\'S PLAN FOR DEBT </p><p>RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE CONCEPT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, </p><p>OR SOME OF ITS MEMBER STATES, GUARANTEEING BONDS FOR LEBANON. </p><p> WHILE THE CONCEPT WAS CREATIVE, THE MFA HAD GIVEN NO </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT.  FERRARI COULD NOT PICTURE THAT THE ITALIAN </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE WOULD ACCEPT THE IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SYRIA ON A POSSIBLE WAR WITH IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FERRARI GAVE A READ-OUT OF THE SEPT. 26 VISIT OF MFA </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY MANTICA TO DAMASCUS, ONE DAY AFTER PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAD STRONGLY SUPPORTED U.S. POLICY DURING A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON IRAQ.  SYRIAN FM FAROUK AL-SHAR\'A HAD </p><p>HARANGUED THE ITALIANS FOR TWENTY MINUTES, CRITICIZING </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S SPEECH IN DETAIL.  SYRIA COULD NOT JUSTIFY TO </p><p>ITS PEOPLE A PRO-AMERICAN POSITION AGAINST IRAQ. AL-SHAR\'A </p><p>THEN TOOK A BREATH, RELAXED AND EXPLAINED THAT THE MAIN </p><p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR AND A POSSIBLE ATTACK </p><p>ON IRAQ TODAY IS THAT IRAQ THIS TIME DID NOT ATTACK AN ARAB </p><p>COUNTRY.  SYRIA IS NOT ANTI-AMERICAN, STRESSED AL-SHAR\'A, AND </p><p>WOULD AGAIN FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE U.S. AGAINST IRAQ IF IRAQ </p><p>WERE TO ATTACK A "FELLOW ARAB COUNTRY."  THE ITALIANS ASKED </p><p>IF AL-SHAR\'A MEANT THAT DAMASCUS WOULD FIGHT AGAINST IRAQ IF </p><p>SADDAM RESPONDED TO A U.S. MILITARY ATTACK BY ATTACKING SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA OR ANOTHER ARAB NEIGHBOR, TO WHICH AL-SHAR\'A REPLIED </p><p>AFFIRMATIVELY.  FERRARI COMMENTED THAT THE SYRIANS ARE STILL </p><p>QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE NEXT U.S. </p><p>TARGET AFTER IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05125  01 OF 02  212149Z </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ITALIAN CANDIDATE FOR EU MIDDLE EAST ENVOY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FERRARI RECOUNTED SOME OF THE GOSSIP AND MANEUVERING </p><p>IN BRUSSELS AND MADRID OVER MORATINOS\' EXTENSION AS THE EU </p><p>REP FOR THE PEACE PROCESS.  WHILE FERRARI </p><p>(UNCHARACTERISTICALLY) HAD SOME GOOD WORDS ABOUT MORATINOS\' </p><p>RECENT EFFORTS WITHIN THE QUARTET FRAMEWORK, HE STATED </p><p>CLEARLY THAT THE ITALIAN MFA WOULD NOT BE SAD TO SEE HIM </p><p>RETIRE.  THE GOI WAS QUIETLY PREPARING TO PROMOTE THE </p><p>CANDIDACY OF ITS FORMER AMBASSADOR TO TEL AVIV, GIANPAOLO </p><p>CARAVAI, TO REPLACE MORATINOS.  WHILE EMPHASIZING THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD ONLY GO FORWARD IF MORATINOS CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE, </p><p>FERRARI SAID THAT CARAVAI WOULD BE LOOKING TO GET TO KNOW USG </p><p>PEACE PROCESS SPECIALISTS BETTER.  (NOTE: WE UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>THE ITALIAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON HAS ALREADY APPROACHED NEA </p><p>INFORMALLY). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FERRARI SAID THAT THE SAUDI AMBASSADOR HAD </p><p>"INFORMALLY, BUT FIRMLY" DEMARCHED HIS BOSS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL </p><p>FOR MID-EAST BADINI, TO URGE THAT THE GOI ISSUE A STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0297 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05125  02 OF 02  212150Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------FBE822  212150Z /40 </p><p>P 211414Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6441 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIRUT PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAMASCUS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY AMMAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL JERUSALEM </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2854 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY, LE, IT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MFA ON LEBANON-ISRAEL WATER ISSUE, SYRIA, </p><p>AND PEACE PROCESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05125  02 OF 02  212150Z </p><p> </p><p>CONDEMNING THE NEW US LEGISLATION ON JERUSALEM.
