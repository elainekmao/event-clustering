<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH BUSINESS LEADER CRITICIZES AKP; SEEKS U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN LETTER TO AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In a January 13 news conference in Istanbul, Turkish </p><p>Industrialists and Businessmen Association (TUSIAD) Chairman </p><p>Tuncay Ozilhan criticized the new AKP government for its </p><p>loosening of fiscal discipline and its failure to take a </p><p>stand on the Iraq issue.  "We don\'t need any of this in such </p><p>a critical period for Turkey," he said.  "The society was </p><p>expecting a consistent and determined performance from the </p><p>government with the power of a single party government, but </p><p>faced a contrary picture."  On the Iraq issue, Ozilhan said </p><p>that while he would prefer a peaceful solution, he said the </p><p>government needed to cut its losses and give its allies "a </p><p>rational amount of support."  He added that "as a democratic </p><p>country Turkey must never stand by a totalitarian regime." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Privately, in a letter to Ambassador Pearson dated </p><p>January 10, Ozilhan reserved some criticism for U.S. policy; </p><p>specifically, the lack of a determined compensation package. </p><p>Ozilhan stated that Turkey had never fully recuperated from </p><p>the losses it incurred from the Gulf War and complained that </p><p>the U.S. had never fully delivered on economic assistance it </p><p>promised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OZILHAN LETTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.E. Robert Pearson </p><p>U.S. Ambassador </p><p>Embassy of the United States </p><p>Ankara </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Ambassador, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Developments in our part of the world are unfolding rapidly </p><p>and their management to minimize undesired consequences is of </p><p>utmost importance.  In this regard, the cooperation between </p><p>our two countries is crucial and I am happy to observe that </p><p>the spirit of partnership and alliance is prevalent all </p><p>around. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What are also of importance are the existing perceptions in </p><p>our two countries and of course, I can only talk about mine. </p><p>I am writing to you in order to underline their importance so </p><p>that we would be aware and, if possible, try to contain them </p><p>so that they would not be an inhibiting factor for the </p><p>development of the aforesaid relations.  I am referring in </p><p>particular to the consequences of the first Gulf War.  This, </p><p>as has been pointed out by many on various occasions, has </p><p>inflicted a most serious economic damage to Turkey.  Much has </p><p>been promised, discussed, elaborated but little has </p><p>materialized to recuperate the damages incurred from this </p><p>operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Similarly, following the tragic events of 9/11 and during the </p><p>Afghan operation, the subject of strengthening Turkey\'s </p><p>economic capabilities has also been discussed, elaborated and </p><p>explored.  Various ideas were floated - qualified industrial </p><p>zones, quota increases, and preferential trade regimes, etc. </p><p>- none of which have borne any tangible results although a </p><p>lot of time has elapsed since. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this point I beg your understanding on the following </p><p>point:  I have observed that during your discussions with our </p><p>authorities you are again referring to "best efforts" for </p><p>American endeavors to make up for the losses of Turkey should </p><p>there be another operation in Iraq.  This statement, I am </p><p>sure you would agree with me, is simply not sufficient to </p><p>alleviate the concerns of the Turkish public opinion in </p><p>general and the business community in particular. </p><p>Furthermore, this inhibits our deliberations to support our </p><p>Government in realizing an even more comprehensive frame of </p><p>cooperation between our two countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In short, Mr. Ambassador, I think it is of paramount </p><p>importance that Turkey is supplied with more than "best </p><p>efforts" and a solid commitment with realistic parameters is </p><p>put in place so that we will not be subject to the skepticism </p><p>towards the West which was exacerbated as a result of </p><p>unrealized desires of support and solidarity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This of course does not imply at all that we are </p><p>unappreciative of all the support extended by the U.S. on </p><p>issues like Turkey\'s relations with the IMF/World Bank and </p><p>during the Copenhagen Summit of the EU in December for which </p><p>I would like to take this occasion to express heartfelt </p><p>gratitude. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I felt the need to underline the above so that the already </p><p>excellent relations that exist between our two countries </p><p>would be further developed and not flawed by disappointments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to extend to you </p><p>and your family my best wishes for the New Year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kindest personal regards, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUNCAY OZILHAN </p><p>Chairman of the Board </p><p>END TEXT OZILHAN LETTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: Ozilhan is generally a reasonable voice in </p><p>the Turkish constellation as demonstrated by his supportive </p><p>comments on economic reform and Iraq.  His stress on the need </p><p>for something concrete from the U.S. on the economic/trade </p><p>side is a clear signal of how Turkish public attitudes </p><p>towards U.S. policies can be shaped. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
