<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008108 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, ECON, AA, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL MEETING WITH AK PARTY </p><p>CHAIRMAN ERDOGAN </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Ambassador met with victorious AK Party </p><p>leader Erdogan for first post-election visit.  He </p><p>complimented AK on its constructive electoral campaign and </p><p>victory and noted U.S. readiness to work with the new AK </p><p>government.  U.S. seeks stronger bilateral economic ties and </p><p>urges AK to follow a market-credible economic policy; will </p><p>continue to promote Turkey\'s EU candidacy; prefers a peaceful </p><p>solution on Iraq but expects Turkey\'s support if UN track </p><p>fails; urges AK to help pursue a Cyprus settlement before EU </p><p>Copenhagen Summit; and is ready to share information to help </p><p>AK formulate its policies.  Responding constructively on Iraq </p><p>and Cyprus and favorably to the offer of further </p><p>consultations, AK chairman Erdogan emphasized the priorities </p><p>of EU candidacy; steps to ease economic difficulties; and </p><p>government reform and anti-corruption measures.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a 45-minute call Nov. 7 on victorious AK Party </p><p>chairman Erdogan, Ambassador noted that the White House had </p><p>welcomed the democratic nature of Turkey\'s Nov. 3 election </p><p>and recognized the overwhelming nature of AK\'s victory.  The </p><p>USG looks forward to working with the new government in every </p><p>aspect of our strategic relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Complimenting Erdogan on the constructive nature of </p><p>AK\'s campaign, which had focused on the five themes of </p><p>economic prosperity, EU candidacy, democratic reforms and </p><p>human rights, enhancing government efficiency, and tackling </p><p>corruption, the Ambassador laid out U.S. views: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK\'s decision to travel to EU capitals to promote Turkey\'s </p><p>candidacy is an excellent initiative.  In this regard, the </p><p>Embassy would be pleased to provide USG assessments of where </p><p>EU member states stand regarding Turkey (Erdogan accepted the </p><p>offer readily). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The U.S. wants to work on developing trade, investment, and </p><p>energy relations to help restore Turkey to solid economic </p><p>growth.  The Turkish markets are rallying on expectation that </p><p>AK will follow sound policies, but it is well to note that </p><p>the markets could react sharply negatively if they see </p><p>negative developments.  Once the government is formed, it </p><p>could be useful for AK to send party reps to the U.S. to </p><p>explain the party\'s programs and views in Washington and </p><p>elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The current GOT has not met commitments to the IMF on the </p><p>budget\'s primary surplus.  As a result there is likely to be </p><p>a $1 billion additional financing burden which could greet </p><p>the new government.  AK might want to press the bureaucracy </p><p>to take the required steps now to close the gap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--On Iraq, the UNSC is close to adopting a very firm </p><p>resolution which, if backed by world public opinion, could </p><p>help achieve peaceful disarmament of Iraq\'s WMD.  Through </p><p>close consultations the U.S. has demonstrated that it takes </p><p>Turkey\'s concerns seriously on every matter. We will keep the </p><p>GOT fully informed to ensure no surprises and hope to be able </p><p>to work as partners on that issue.  If in the end we are </p><p>unable to get the help we need from the UN, we will look to </p><p>our friends for support as we apply the right of self defense </p><p>to protect ourselves.  The Embassy stands ready to provide </p><p>additional details to AK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Regarding Cyprus, there is still time before the EU </p><p>Copenhagen Summit to find a solution; we will keep AK fully </p><p>informed on U.S. thinking; a solution would bring benefits on </p><p>a number of other questions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--President Bush will take advantage of the Prague Summit to </p><p>press EU member states on behalf of Turkey\'s candidacy; if </p><p>the new GOT could be in place by the time of Prague, it would </p><p>have a strong impact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Congratulating the Republican Party for its success in </p><p>U.S. elections and noting the importance to AK of continued </p><p>strong relations with the U.S., Erdogan emphasized the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--U.S. support for Turkey\'s EU candidacy is highly </p><p>appreciated.  Contrary to his former opposition to the EU, he </p><p>now realizes that Turkey must enter (although, he added, the </p><p>presence of three million Turks in Western Europe means </p><p>Turkey is already there).  AK wants to speed up </p><p>implementation of all relevant changes, which are supported </p><p>by President Sezer as well; a date for accession negotiations </p><p>will accelerate the pace of change.  AK appreciates what </p><p>President Bush is ready to do on Turkey\'s behalf at Prague; </p><p>President Sezer will also lobby vigorously there; </p><p>unfortunately, Turkish post-election procedures will not </p><p>permit formation of the new GOT by Nov. 22. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--It is incumbent on the new government to remedy the </p><p>unemployment and other severe economic difficulties faced by </p><p>Turks across the country.  This is an enormous </p><p>responsibility; indeed, AK must tackle the challenge alone as </p><p>a single-party government, one of the disadvantages of </p><p>winning such a sweeping victory.  In this regard, AK wants </p><p>increased trade opportunities in the U.S., not aid.  Higher </p><p>exports would mean more jobs and growth and enable Turkey to </p><p>pay off its IMF debts.  AK wants Turkey to be a creditor </p><p>country, not a debtor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK sees the need to reestablish mutual confidence among </p><p>Turkish institutions; the lack of confidence stems from </p><p>corruption, which has reached unimaginable proportions and </p><p>against which AK will take serious steps.  AK also aims </p><p>sharply to reduce the number of ministerial portfolios. </p><p>Erdogan will summon AK M.P.s in several days to agree to his </p><p>plan to sell off the State-provided housing for M.P.s.  As a </p><p>further revenue enhancing measure, "one which could plug the </p><p>primary surplus gap", AK wants to sell off as much as </p><p>possible of the vast State holdings of real estate and </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--It is essential for AK to make itself known directly, not </p><p>allow its image to be set by a tendentious Turkish press.  In </p><p>this regard, AK would definitely like to discuss arrangements </p><p>for its officials to visit Washington even before the </p><p>government is established. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Concerning Iraq, AK agrees that the best solution is a </p><p>peaceful one.  At the same time, AK wants to see Iraq </p><p>disarmed of WMD and shares U.S. unease about the nature of </p><p>the Saddam regime.  In a similar vein AK would not want to </p><p>see another 9/11; neither Islam nor any other religion </p><p>condones terrorism; we need a common global platform against </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK wants to see a just, lasting solution for Cyprus, namely </p><p>an equally sovereign bizonal state; if the U.S. uses its </p><p>weight, then a solution is possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Erdogan and the Ambassador showed an easy rapport </p><p>during an uncontroversial 15-minute post-meeting press </p><p>briefing.  AK senior foreign policy advisor/former career </p><p>Ambassador Yakis and Embassy polcounselor (notetaker) also </p><p>attended the meeting. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
