Convoy personnel heard shots impacting </p><p>nearby.  The convoy commander crossed the highway to find out </p><p>where the fire originated; he found some Kuwaiti officers who </p><p>told him that some Kuwaiti soldiers were firing on a rifle </p><p>range on a Kuwaiti military camp.  The range was oriented </p><p>perpendicular to Hwy 80.  Contrary to earlier reports, the </p><p>Marines did not return fire.  No injuries were reported. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The initial report was that Marines in a ccnvoy were </p><p>fired upon, that the Marines returned fire, that the </p><p>attackers fled, and that the Marines pursued them to a mosque </p><p>in which the attackers took refuge.  The on-scene commander </p><p>assures that the Marines did not shoot and that there is no </p><p>truth whatsoever to the mosque story. </p><p> </p><p>3.
