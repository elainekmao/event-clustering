<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PINS, PGOV, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO TALKS TOUGH ON OIL THEFT AND WARRI CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1328 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1286 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. Dawn M. Liberi; reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) President Obasanjo summoned Charge Liberi and other </p><p>diplomatic chiefs of mission to his office August 6 for a </p><p>short briefing on the theft of oil in the Niger Delta.  The </p><p>extraordinarily short (25 minutes) meeting gave the </p><p>diplomatic corps a warning of imminent security force action </p><p>in the Delta, most probably concentrated in the Warri region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) During the short briefing using power-points, the </p><p>President highlighted the fact that the volume of crude oil </p><p>lost to theft has  hit levels not seen since 1999, the last </p><p>year of military rule.  As a result, Nigeria is losing over </p><p>$3 billion a year, and is having difficulty meeting its OPEC </p><p>oil production quota.  This theft is carried out by organized </p><p>groups who siphon crude  oil from pipelines to coastal barges </p><p>and ocean-going tankers.  Nigeria cannot afford this </p><p>hemorrhaging of national revenues, he declared.   Noting that </p><p>this illegal trade is protected by well armed militants, </p><p>Obasanjo warned that Nigerian security forces may soon have </p><p>to "disarm" them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) The Charge asked the President if efforts were being </p><p>made to prosecute the perpetrators of this large-scale, </p><p>organized oil theft.  After turning to his advisors, he </p><p>responded that the government was indeed prosecuting </p><p>offenders and that a "task force" was being established for </p><p>this purpose.  The Charge also asked about his prior day\'s </p><p>meeting with a group of traditional leaders from the </p><p>oil-producing South-South region, which he proclaimed a great </p><p>success; "they agreed with me and will cooperate" in attempts </p><p>to curb oil theft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Another diplomat queried the President on where the </p><p>stolen crude oil was being sold, to which he replied "oil </p><p>refineries in Cote d\'Ivoire and Cameroon." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) According to Ijaw national leader Chief Edwin K. Clark, </p><p>a group of South-South traditional rulers and youth leaders </p><p>was summoned to the Presidential Villa August 5 for a meeting </p><p>on oil theft and pipeline vandalization.  In an August 6 </p><p>meeting with CRO, Clark cited the President\'s quote of over </p><p>USD three billion per year as the annual cost of oil stolen </p><p>and claimed Obasanjo called upon the community leaders to </p><p>assist the federal government in suppressing such crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C)  According to Clark, the President\'s meeting started </p><p>with the viewing of a "video" on bunkering activity, showing </p><p>the barges, oil tankers, valves and hoses/pipes used to tap </p><p>into Shell and Chevron\'s pipelines and flow stations. </p><p>(Comment: This was probably the slide show of surveillance </p><p>photographs taken and assembled by Shell and given to the </p><p>President recently. End Comment) Clark commented that the </p><p>photos showed that this activity is not orchestrated by </p><p>simple youths in the oil swamps but rather by powerful and </p><p>sophisticated "barons" capable of marshaling resources like </p><p>ocean-going oil tankers.  Nevertheless, the Ijaw chief </p><p>conceded that "the boys" (his term for the Ijaw militants of </p><p>the Federated Niger Delta Ijaw Communities--FNDIC) are a </p><p>party to some of the oil theft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) After the video presentation, Obasanjo discussed how </p><p>the communities could play a helpful role in curbing the loss </p><p>of oil.  Clark and other ethnic leaders proposed community </p><p>patrols to find and detain anyone attempting to tap into oil </p><p>companies\' pipelines or flow stations.  According to Clark, </p><p>the President and ethnic leaders assembled agreed to create </p><p>community-level watch groups, headed by community chairmen </p><p>and involving youth such as the Ijaw militants of Warri, </p><p>provided that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) </p><p>support these community patrols in cash and in kind.  The </p><p>Chairman of the NDDC, Onyema Ugochukwu, and his acting </p><p>deputy, Timi Alaibe, were at the meeting and agreed to fund </p><p>the community patrol initiative, said Clark. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Warri Notes </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Turning to the recent upsurge in violence in the Warri </p><p>riverine area, Clark downplayed the significance of the </p><p>August 2 Itsekiri attacks on three Ijaw villages, claiming </p><p>these were "small villages" and revealing that residents of </p><p>the Ijaw village near the Warri Refinery had been involved in </p><p>the theft of oil.  Clark stated he had met with the Ijaw </p><p>youth militants (FNDIC) immediately after the August 2 </p><p>attacks and persuaded them to refrain from engaging in </p><p>retaliatory strikes, absent additional Itsekiri provocations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) In an August 6 meeting with ECONCONS and CRO, NDDC </p><p>Acting Managing Director Timi Alaibe confirmed the plan to </p><p>create local community patrol committees that the NDDC will </p><p>compensate.  He characterized this plan as one of three parts </p><p>of the larger security strategy for the Niger Delta that </p><p>President Obasanjo began unveiling at the August 5 meeting. </p><p>The second element is the creation of a federal security task </p><p>force, comprised of police, army, navy and the NDDC, which </p><p>will attempt to restore peace and security in the Warri </p><p>region first.  The third element is an intensified effort to </p><p>find a political solution to the Warri crisis.  Alaibe </p><p>acknowledged that the NDDC\'s role in supporting community </p><p>patrol committees will call for significant new funds for the </p><p>already strapped Commission, but he claimed that President </p><p>Obasanjo has pledged to provide supplemental funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10.(C) President Obasanjo appears to be confounding two </p><p>separate security issues -- the theft of oil in the Delta and </p><p>the rise of ethnic militancy.  Although there is overlap, as </p><p>the Ijaw militants are clearly involved in oil theft, the </p><p>threats are distinct.  Obasanjo may view it as expedient, </p><p>however, to crack down on the militants of Warri under the </p><p>guise of fighting oil bunkering crime.  The initiative to </p><p>create community-based patrol groups may be little more than </p><p>fluff in light of the ominous warning of a security crackdown </p><p>but, if serious, could be counter-productive.  Such an </p><p>attempt to use economic incentives to control belligerent </p><p>youth involved in oil theft could easily be transformed into </p><p>an extortion scheme by the militants, such as occurred to oil </p><p>companies\' well intentioned plans to improve security in the </p><p>swamps through funding of community youth "home guards." </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
