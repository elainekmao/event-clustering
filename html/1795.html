<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p>PASS TO USAID AFR/ACTING AA DICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EAID, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON MINISTER OF </p><p>  AGRICULTURE -- A CALL FOR A MORE TARGETED AGRICULTURAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Ambassador Jeter met June 26 with Minister of Agriculture </p><p>Bello for a discussion of U.S.-Nigeria relations in the </p><p>agriculture sector.   USAID Country Director provided a </p><p>thorough brief on the range of USG agricultural assistance </p><p>programs.  Minister Bello thought USG efforts were </p><p>under-funded, too broad in their scope, and undefined in </p><p>expectations.  Ambassador Jeter stressed the need for </p><p>capacity-building resulting from two decades of policy and </p><p>resource neglect.  Ministry Directors addressed their needs </p><p>within the limited framework (biotech, vaccines and extension </p><p>services) for USG assistance as outlined by President </p><p>Obasanjo during his recent visit to Washington.  USAID agreed </p><p>to consider programs addressing those needs.  Minister Bello </p><p>asserted that certain trade restrictions were necessary and </p><p>would continue for now.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador Jeter, USAID Country Director Hobgood and </p><p>Embassy Economic Section Chief Carrig met June 26 with </p><p>Minister of Agriculture Adamu Bello, Minister of State Chief </p><p>Chris Agbobu, and five of the Ministry\'s Directors at the </p><p>Minister\'s Federal Secretariat office for a discussion of </p><p>U.S.-Nigerian relations, principally in the agriculture </p><p>sector.  Members of the press attended the initial part of </p><p>the meeting. The session was very cordiale, and the embassy </p><p>delegation was warmly received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Ambassador Jeter opened by noting the importance of </p><p>Nigeria to the USG,s interests in sub-Saharan Africa. </p><p>Nigeria,s size, population, regional influence and </p><p>engagement make critical a full and progressive relationship </p><p>between our two nations, he said.  The Ambassador continued, </p><p>pointing out that our USAID program for Nigeria, a </p><p>significant component of which is in agriculture, was the </p><p>largest in Africa and that the success of that program is as </p><p>important to the present Administration was it was to last. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Country Director Hobgood then briefed the Minister </p><p>on the range of USG agricultural support programs ) both </p><p>through USAID and U.S. Department of Agriculture ) now </p><p>underway in Nigeria, noting that they covered many areas. </p><p>Minister Bello agreed there was broad coverage, but said he </p><p>was not fully satisfied with both the depth and the focus of </p><p>much of the USG,s agricultural support assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SUB) First, Minister Bellow noted that Nigeria,s ties to </p><p>the U.S., cultural, historical, economical (primarily through </p><p>oil exports) and now, political, are sizeable and growing. </p><p>These relationships, he said, merit a much more robust aid </p><p>investment on the part of the U.S.   He characterized the </p><p>present commitment as &a mere fraction of the cost of one </p><p>part of a missile system.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Second, the Minister said he thought that although USG </p><p>programs were well intentioned, they were more directed </p><p>toward capacity-building and model construction than toward </p><p>&measurable8 results.  He said his Ministry wanted aid </p><p>denominated in measurables such as a targeted increase in </p><p>crop yields, savings in fertilizer, and numbers of farm </p><p>implements delivered to the field.  He noted he had, that </p><p>day, signed an agreement with the Japanese that followed on </p><p>an earlier effort, which had met his criteria of &measurable </p><p>deliverables8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Ambassador Jeter followed up on the Minister,s </p><p>comments by noting there were absolutely essential precursors </p><p>to proper use and sustained development of the </p><p>&measureables8 that both he and the Minister would like to </p><p>see in Nigeria in the feature.  He cited the rule of law, </p><p>transparency, integrity in government and a military that </p><p>accepts civilian control and direction as critical to a </p><p>democracy.  The Minister accepted that, but noted that with </p><p>70 percent of Nigeria,s population living on subsistence </p><p>agriculture at less than one U.S. dollar per day, there was </p><p>need enough for a few more immediate &measureables8 along </p><p>the way to a fully developed democracy.  &It isn,t a lack </p><p>of civics lessons for Army officers that will bring the Army </p><p>back; it will be the frustration with economic failure by </p><p>that 70 percent who are hungry that will cause the military </p><p>to intervene,8 he insisted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The Ambassador next recalled President Obasanjo,s </p><p>comment during his recent Washington visit that it might be </p><p>useful if U.S. agricultural assistance programs were fewer in </p><p>number and targeted of Nigeria,s defined top priorities. </p><p>Minister Bello picked up on this immediately.  He then ticked </p><p>off the three targets selected by the President: biotech, </p><p>vaccines and extension services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Ambassador Jeter noted that beyond the GON,s </p><p>identification of the three targets, there was no clear sense </p><p>of where Nigeria wanted to go with such a select program </p><p>group.  He noted that we needed to have better clarity and </p><p>should work together closely on program design, execution and </p><p>evaluation, that agriculture was only one of many competing </p><p>needs for USAID resources, and because of years of neglect, </p><p>the focus had been on capacity-building.  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that decades of military rule had left the public and </p><p>private sectors &a mere shadow8 of their former efficiency </p><p>envied throughout Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minister Bello then called on two of his directors </p><p>for sketches of what they saw as pressing needs for Nigeria </p><p>within the framework President Obasanjo had set out in </p><p>Washington: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      -  The Director of Fisheries thanked the U.S. for the </p><p>recent certification of Nigeria for shrimp exports to the </p><p>U.S., following industry compliance with TED regulations.  He </p><p>noted a need for USG assistance in developing a Nigerian </p><p>aquaculture industry for fish farming. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      -  The Director of Agricultural Science followed next. </p><p>He noted that Nigeria,s farm animal vaccine industry is not </p><p>competitive.  He cited dated technology, poor packaging and </p><p>marketing as the primary areas where USG assistance would be </p><p>useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID Country Director agreed to have relevant members of his </p><p>staff meet with the Ministry\'s Directors to determine whether </p><p>suitable USAID assistance programs exist to address the </p><p>concerns raised in the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Ambassador Jeter concluded by noting that although </p><p>programs may be targeted for the objectives sought by the </p><p>GON, there simply was no substitute for private sector </p><p>investment and management, that aid could only be a catalyst, </p><p>not a replacement for trade and market discipline.  The </p><p>Ambassador then raised with Minister Bello USG concerns about </p><p>trade restrictions.  He cited two: remaining bans on the </p><p>importation of some commodities, e.g., grain sorghum and </p><p>millet, and a de facto ban on poultry imports due to the </p><p>unavailability of import processing documentation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Minister Bello had a quick response for each concern. </p><p> On the bans, he said, simply, that the domestic market </p><p>needed protection and it was incumbent on the GON to provide </p><p>it.  On poultry imports, although he acknowledged the ban had </p><p>been lifted over a year ago, health concerns blocked </p><p>importation for now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) As he was escorting us to our car, the Deputy </p><p>Minister raised Bello\'s desire to visit Washington as was </p><p>mentioned during President Obasanjo\'s May official state </p><p>visit to the U.S.  Bello has written to Secretary of </p><p>Agriculture Ann Veneman with some proposed dates, which the </p><p>Deputy Minister said he would also convey to the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Bello, a tall, handsome Northerner from Adamawa </p><p>State, is new to his office but seems to have a very firm </p><p>grasp of the concerns of his ministry.  It will be worthwhile </p><p>to engage him on a full range of issues, agricultural sales, </p><p>markets restrictions, developmental goals and policy, when </p><p>and if he visits Washington.  The Embassy endorses his visit </p><p>as a possible way of reinjecting vigor into our agricultural </p><p>programs </p><p>15. (U)  Comment.  Bello, who is new to his office, is very </p><p>articulate and seems to have a good grasp of the concerns of </p><p>his Ministry. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
