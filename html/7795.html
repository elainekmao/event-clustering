<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, CA, FAC </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST: CANADA WELCOMES ROADMAP, RECOMMENDS </p><p>SIDELINING BUT NOT HUMILIATING ARAFAT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 111481 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Canadian Foreign Minister Graham issued a statement </p><p>praising the release of the Quartet\'s Roadmap, and saying it </p><p>bolsters the prospects for peace in the Middle East.  Graham </p><p>said the Roadmap and the confirmation of Abu Mazen as </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister were the "first positive things we </p><p>have seen in a long time" in the peace process, and called on </p><p>all parties to take the steps needed for the Roadmap\'s </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We discussed the Roadmap and reftel points with Don </p><p>Sinclair, Foreign Affairs Director General for Middle East </p><p>and North Africa, who commended the U.S.\'s willingness to </p><p>take this on.  While Sinclair agreed with our points on the </p><p>need to bolster Abu Mazen\'s position, he strongly disagreed </p><p>with the tactic of shunning Arafat.  Sinclair and his Foreign </p><p>Affairs colleagues argued that despite Arafat\'s </p><p>obstructionism and incompetence, he remains a major symbol of </p><p>nationalism for Palestinians.  If we deal exclusively with </p><p>Abu Mazen and humiliate Arafat, Sinclair continued, it would </p><p>put Abu Mazen in an untenable position, as he would be seen </p><p>by Palestinians as beholden to Israel and the U.S.  Jonathan </p><p>Laine, Foreign Affairs Senior Advisor for the MEPP, recalled </p><p>how Palestinians had rallied around Arafat during the IDF </p><p>siege of his Ramallah headquarters in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Jill Stirk, Foreign Affairs Director for the Middle </p><p>East, emphasized the need for quick results after the release </p><p>of the Roadmap.  The window of opportunity would only be open </p><p>briefly, and there were many on both sides ready to derail </p><p>the process.  While incidents on both sides are inevitable, </p><p>she said, we need to show progress in order to instill </p><p>confidence.  Sinclair said that the Palestinians needed to </p><p>take the first step by ending terrorist attacks, but that </p><p>Israel must immediately "reward" this effort.  The key issue, </p><p>Sinclair continued, will be eliminating Israeli settlements, </p><p>which will allow a return to the 1967 borders (with some </p><p>modifications as agreed by the parties). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Sinclair told us that Canada is ready to help in any </p><p>way it can, but would wait for U.S. suggestions and guidance </p><p>on what role it should play.  He noted that Canada has a </p><p>reputation in the region for evenhandedness, and that it has </p><p>done considerable work on the refugee issue.  Looking ahead, </p><p>Sinclair said that Canada has already offered to contribute </p><p>military personnel if there is agreement on a third party </p><p>presence.  Despite Israeli resistance, Canada wants to </p><p>explore the third party option as a less destructive, more </p><p>humane alternative to the fence currently being put in place. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Sinclair said that including Egypt and Jordan in our </p><p>Palestinian security force training plans was brilliant.  He </p><p>did not expect our Quartet partners, which are distrusted by </p><p>the Israelis, to add much value to the process.  The </p><p>leadership onus, Sinclair emphasized, will be on the U.S. </p><p>The parties themselves, if left alone, were incapable of </p><p>following through.  If the Roadmap is to work, Sinclair </p><p>concluded, the U.S. must take charge. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
