<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 VATICAN 002268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EB (GADSDEN), EUR/PD/PA (HILTON) </p><p>STATE PASS TO USDA FAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, ETRD, TBIO, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, ETRD, TBIO, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, ETRD, TBIO, VT, VTPREL, VTPREL, Biotechnology </p><p>SUBJECT: AG-BIOTECH: GETTING THE VATICAN TO "YES." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1.    (SBU) SUMMARY: BECAUSE OF THE VATICAN\'S MORAL </p><p>AUTHORITY, IT CAN INFLUENCE GOVERNMENTS\' SOCIAL AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENTAL POLICIES.  PERSUADING THE VATICAN TO COME OUT </p><p>MORE FORTHRIGHTLY IN FAVOR OF GMOS IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02268  01 OF 03  100539Z </p><p>AGRICULTURE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD COULD INFLUENCE DECISION </p><p>MAKERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WOULD UNDERCUT ANTI-GMO </p><p>EUROPEAN ACTIVISTS\' ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>GMO-HOSTILE EU AND EU-MEMBER STATES\' POLICIES. VATICAN </p><p>DECISION MAKERS BELIEVE BIOTECHNOLOGY IS PROMISING, BUT THEY </p><p>COUNSEL CAUTION AND PATIENCE BECAUSE OF UNKNOWN RISKS.  KEY </p><p>TO MOVING THE VATICAN POSITION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS IS </p><p>UNDERSTANDING ITS PEOPLE AND ITS FOREIGN POLICY LEITMOTIF: </p><p>"THE TRUE GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON."  BEFORE VATICAN DECISION </p><p>MAKERS WILL PROMOTE BIOTECH, THEY WILL WANT TO SEE </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, AND SOCIAL AND CONSUMER CONCERNS </p><p>ADDRESSED.   THE VATICAN NEEDS CONVINCING THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>AND GMOS ARE FOR TODAY, AND THAT THE BEST SCIENCE DOVETAILS </p><p>WITH ITS LEITMOTIF. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  WORKING WITH EMBASSY ROME BIOTECH ACTION GROUP, </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN IS MAKING THIS ISSUE A FOCUSED PRIORITY OF </p><p>OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE COMING MONTHS. BUILDING ON OUR </p><p>PREVIOUS EFFORTS (E.G. AMBASSADOR HOSTED DINNER FOR GMO </p><p>EXPERT C.C. PRAKASH), WE WILL FOCUS ON BRINGING IN U.S. </p><p>EXPERTS FOR CONSULTATIONS, NOMINATING A VATICAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY OFFICIAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL VISITORS PROGRAM, </p><p>PROPOSING ACTIVITIES ON THE MARGINS OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT </p><p>IN JUNE, AND HOSTING A VISIT TO INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL </p><p>RESEARCH STATIONS FOR VATICAN EXPERTS LATER IN 2002.  WE HAVE </p><p>A GOOD WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS THE VATICAN ON THIS </p><p>WITH THE NEW CONVERGENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE USG ON THE FLIP </p><p>SIDE OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH -- HUMAN CLONING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>VATICAN ON BIOTECH: "YES, BUT.." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02268  01 OF 03  100539Z </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ARTICLES IN "LA CIVILITA CATTOLICA," A SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>VATICAN PUBLICATION, ARE VETTED BY THE VATICAN\'S SECRETARIAT </p><p>OF STATE BEFORE PUBLISHING. THEY TEND TO REFLECT CURRENT </p><p>VATICAN POLICY AND PREOCCUPATIONS. JESUIT PRIEST AND FORMER </p><p>PROFESSOR OF HUMAN GENETICS IN THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE AT </p><p>GEMELLI CLINIC, ANGELO SERRA, RECENTLY WROTE AN ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>PLANT AND ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR "LA CIVILTA CATTOLICA." </p><p>SERRA\'S ARTICLE OFFERS INSIGHTS ON VATICAN THINKING ON </p><p>SEVERAL ASPECTS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATION, AND </p><p>FORMULATES "NEW OBLIGATIONS" FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE ARTICLE LAUDS COLLABORATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS, </p><p>REGULATORS, FARMERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS (PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE U.S.) AS A SOURCE OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN GMO\'S, SERRA </p><p>DEDICATES THE GREATER PART OF HIS ARTICLE TO THE "RISKS" OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY. FIRSTLY, FOOD AND HEALTH SECURITY RISKS: THE </p><p>INCREASE IN ALLERGIES, RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS AND OF MOST </p><p>CONCERN, ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE. THE U.S. IS SINGLED OUT FOR BEING </p><p>TOO BLITHE TOWARDS RISK ASSESSMENT, BUT SERRA ALSO CRITICIZES </p><p>THE SOMETIMES-IRRATIONAL OPPOSITION OF ANTI-GM ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> SECONDLY, SERRA SOLICITS GREATER CONSIDERATION OF THE RISKS </p><p>TO BIODIVERSITY, GIVING EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES LIKE ITALY AND </p><p>INDIA THAT PRODUCE MOST OF THEIR FOOD FROM 10 OR SO STRAINS </p><p>OF RICE, GRAIN AND CORN. SERRA CALLS FOR ATTENTIVE AND </p><p>DETAILED OBSERVATION OF AREAS WHERE GMO ORGANISMS HAVE BEEN </p><p>INTRODUCED TO AVOID THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY THAT MAY IN TURN </p><p>ADVERSELY AFFECT HUMAN BEINGS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02268  01 OF 03  100539Z </p><p>5.  (U) SERRA\'S THIRD "RISK" DEALS WITH THE SOCIAL </p><p>REPERCUSSIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ECONOMICS AND </p><p>EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HE QUOTES FIGURES THAT PUT 81 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE GLOBAL AGROCHEMICAL MARKET AND 37 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>GLOBAL SEED MARKET IN THE HANDS OF TEN COMPANIES.  SERRA </p><p>LAMENTS THE PRODUCTION OF STERILE PATENTED SEEDS BECAUSE IT </p><p>CONCENTRATES GREAT WEALTH IN A FEW HANDS AND THREATENS THE </p><p>SURVIVAL OF THE POOREST.  HE CALLS FOR STRATEGIES THAT ENSURE </p><p>AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC "EVENING OUT" THAT FAVOR THE POOREST. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) SERRA CONCLUDES BY DESCRIBING PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY\'S </p><p>GOAL AS "THE PERFECT", THE MEANS USED BY GENETIC ENGINEERING </p><p>TO REACH THIS GOAL AS "EXTRAORDINARY," THE RESULTS AS </p><p>"PROMISING," BUT THAT ITS CONSEQUENCES NEED ACCURATE ETHICAL </p><p>REFLECTION. (NOTE: SERRA\'S VIEWS TRACK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE </p><p>VIEWS WE HAVE HEARD BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY FROM KEY </p><p>VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS IN THIS DISCUSSION, E.G., BISHOP </p><p>SGRECCIA AND ARCHBISHOP MARCHETTO END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>WHO\'S WHO ON GMOS IN THE VATICAN; WHERE THEY STAND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5424 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02268  02 OF 03  100540Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  EVG-00   ACQ-00 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    E-00     VC-00    HHS-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00 </p><p>      MED-07   NSAE-00  OES-01   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  ECA-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------AC8E02  100540Z /38 </p><p>O 100521Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 002268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EB (GADSDEN), EUR/PD/PA (HILTON) </p><p>STATE PASS TO USDA FAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, ETRD, TBIO, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: AG-BIOTECH: GETTING THE VATICAN TO "YES." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) GENERALLY POSITIVE:  BISHOP ELIO SGRECCIA, VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT, PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE. SGRECCIA IS THE TOP </p><p>VATICAN ETHICIST SPECIALIZING IN BIOTECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL </p><p>ETHICS, HEALTH AND FAMILY ISSUES. HIS APPROACH TO </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM - THE THEORETICAL </p><p>BENEFITS NEED TO BE BALANCED BY ADEQUATE RESEARCH AND PATIENT </p><p>OBSERVATION. LIKE ALL VATICAN OFFICIALS HE LOOKS TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02268  02 OF 03  100540Z </p><p>SECRETARIAT OF STATE FOR GUIDANCE AND PERMISSION TO UNDERTAKE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES. THE ACADEMY FOR LIFE HAS PUBLISHED </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S CLEAREST POSITION TO DATE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p>SGRECCIA WAS EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF AN EMBASSY INITIATIVE </p><p>THAT BROUGHT U.S. BIOTECHNOLOGIST, C.S. PRAKASH, AND VATICAN </p><p>SCIENTISTS TOGETHER FOR A ROUND TABLE IN 2001.  AT A RECENT </p><p>LUNCH, SGRECCIA TOLD DCM THAT HE LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING </p><p>WITH US ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  GENERALLY NEGATIVE:  ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO MARCHETTO, </p><p>PERMANENT OBSERVER, FAO, ROME, AND SINCE NOVEMBER 2001 </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MIGRANTS AND ITINERANTS. HE ENTERED THE HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>SERVICE IN 1968, AND SERVED IN A NUMBER OF SUB-SAHARAN </p><p>NUNCIATURES. MARCHETTO IS THE CLASSIC EUROPEAN BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>SKEPTIC. HIS POSITION APPEARS BASED MORE ON POPULAR </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF GMOS THAN ON GOOD SCIENCE. HE RELISHES PLAYING </p><p>THE DEVIL\'S ADVOCATE AND CONCENTRATING ON THE "WHAT IFS." </p><p>YET, LIKE THE REST OF THE HOLY SEE, HIS PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS </p><p>SERVING HUMANITY.  IF HE CAN BE PERSUADED THAT GMOS PRESENT A </p><p>NET BENEFIT, HE WOULD BE A POWERFUL ADVOCATE FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  GENERALLY POSITIVE:  ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, </p><p>PERMANENT OBSERVER, UN OFFICES AND SPECIALIST AGENCIES, </p><p>GENEVA. MARTIN, A FORMER IV VISITOR, IS NOT A PROFESSIONALLY </p><p>TRAINED VATICAN DIPLOMAT AND THUS UNTAINTED BY THE PALL OF </p><p>"SUPER CAUTION." HE CALLS A SPADE A SPADE AND APPRECIATES </p><p>GOOD SCIENCE. HE WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT ALLY ON THE BIOTECH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PLAYING FIELD. HIS REPUTATION IN WORLD TRADE </p><p>AND MONETARY CIRCLES IS HIGH, MAKING HIM POTENTIALLY </p><p>INFLUENTIAL WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS. MARTIN\'S FOCUS ON HUMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02268  02 OF 03  100540Z </p><p>RIGHTS ISSUES IN GENEVA COULD BE AN ENTRY POINT FOR THE </p><p>PROMOTION OF BIOTECH BENEFITS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  GENERALLY POSITIVE: MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE, </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER. MIGLIORE WILL LIKELY BE RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR GIVING THE WORKING LEVEL "OK" TO MOST BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>INITIATIVES. AS IS MARTIN, MIGLIORE IS PRAGMATIC AND </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONE OF THE EMBASSY\'S MOST ACCESSIBLE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL INTERLOCUTORS, WE CAN EXPECT HIM TO BE REASONABLE. </p><p> HE HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROBLEMS CAUSED IN </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY MALNUTRITION AND CROP FAILURE. HE </p><p>SERVED AT THE NUNCIATURE IN WASHINGTON DURING THE 1990S AND </p><p>WOULD BE OPEN TO THE BENEFITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, BUT HE WOULD </p><p>ALSO INSIST ON ADEQUATE PRECAUTIONS BEFORE GIVING HIS "NULLA </p><p>OSTA". (NOTE: IT IS CLASSIC VATICAN STRATEGY TO NOT MAKE A </p><p>MOVE BEFORE RECEIVING PERMISSION -- THE "NULLA OSTA" -- FROM </p><p>ONE\'S SUPERIORS. THIS STIFLES INITIATIVE AND GIVES UNDUE </p><p>EMPHASIS TO THE CAUTIONARY APPROACH. THIS APPLIES TO ALL OF </p><p>THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERSONS. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GETTING THEM TO PLAY ON OUR TEAM </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  THE VATICAN IS POTENTIALLY A VALUABLE ALLY IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT TO PROMOTE BROADER ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS AMONG OUR KEY TRADING PARTNERS. ITS </p><p>MORAL CLOUT STILL INFLUENCES MANY NATIONS IN THE EU, AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHERE, IN CERTAIN </p><p>INSTANCES, INDIVIDUAL CLERGY ANTAGONISTIC TO PROFIT-MAKING </p><p>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS HELP BEAT THE ANTI-GMO DRUMS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02268  02 OF 03  100540Z </p><p>VATICAN BACKING FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS AS A MEANS TO FEED </p><p>THE WORLD\'S POOR WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CHANGING </p><p>THE GENERALLY FEARFUL EUROPEAN MINDSET BY UNDERCUTTING A KEY </p><p>RATIONALE OF ANTI-BIOTECH ACTIVISTS (THAT U.S. COMPANIES WILL </p><p>DISPLACE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF AGRICULTURE ACROSS THE </p><p>WORLD).  POST\'S EFFORTS TO EXPOSE VATICAN PROTAGONISTS TO THE </p><p>SCIENCE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY </p><p>2001 WE ORGANIZED A PANEL DISCUSSION BETWEEN VISITING GMO </p><p>EXPERT C.S. PRAKASH OF TUSKEEGEE UNIVERSITY AND MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF THE SCIENCES (PAS) AND THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE (PAL).  AMBASSADOR FOLLOWED THAT </p><p>WITH A DINNER IHO DR. PRAKASH IN FEBRUARY 2002, ATTENDED BY </p><p>VATICAN FM TAURAN AND SEVERAL SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>12.
