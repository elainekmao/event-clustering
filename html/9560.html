<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, ECON, EINV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  JOINT STATEMENT CONDEMNING MAOIST </p><p>EXTORTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  KATHMANDU 1367  B.  KATHMANDU 1358 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Ref A cable resent to expanded list of </p><p>addressees (AmEmbassies Berlin and Paris). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On July 21, the Industrial Security Group in </p><p>Nepal released a press statement condemning Maoist </p><p>extortions of individuals and businesses during the </p><p>current cease-fire.  Despite provisions in the code of </p><p>conduct barring the practice, Maoist exactions have </p><p>grown in size and scope in recent months.  The </p><p>Industrial Security Group, chaired by the British </p><p>Ambassador and composed of the bilateral chambers of </p><p>commerce and industry and representatives of the </p><p>embassies of France, Germany, India, U.K. and the U.S., </p><p>issued the statement to highlight on the Maoists\' </p><p>continuing crimes and to call for an end to them.  The </p><p>Ambassadors received the support of the Prime Minister </p><p>before releasing the statement (ref B).  (The statement </p><p>is provided in its entirety at paragraph 4.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment:  The public statement is precedent- </p><p>setting, as it brought together disparate national </p><p>agendas on a single issue.  Despite early uncertainty </p><p>surrounding the stand of the Indian Embassy, in the end </p><p>it joined with the other members in endorsing the </p><p>statement.  In addition to the unusual cooperation of </p><p>India, it is notable that the usually quiet European </p><p>missions also fully supported this action.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Press Statement, begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Joint Statement of the Industrial Security Group </p><p>Concerning Maoist Extortion </p><p> </p><p>Throughout the period of insurgency in Nepal, </p><p>businesses have complained of extortion demands by </p><p>representatives of the Communist Party of Nepal </p><p>(Maoist).  Extortion is a hidden crime, conducted away </p><p>from view, which exploits the fear of its victims. </p><p>Before the cease-fire, this extortion was enforced by </p><p>terrorist threats and use of violence, including </p><p>beatings, shootings and bombings.  The cease-fire </p><p>between the government and the militants in January, </p><p>and the adoption of a Code of Conduct in March should </p><p>have lead to the end of extortion.  Sadly, this has not </p><p>been the case.  Reports of extortion by members of the </p><p>CPN(M) have increased substantially during the cease- </p><p>fire in the number of incidents, geographical extent </p><p>and amounts of money demanded. </p><p> </p><p>Though the cease-fire has reduced the level of over-all </p><p>violence, Maoists have continued to press Nepalis from </p><p>all walks of life--businessmen, families, farmers, </p><p>landowners, civil servants, development workers, </p><p>educators and factory workers--for money and food. </p><p>These extortion demands are criminal and violate not </p><p>only Nepali law but also the internationally recognized </p><p>right of the Nepali people to security for themselves, </p><p>their families and their property.  Maoist extortion </p><p>also flouts the ninth point of the Code of Conduct, </p><p>which states "There will be no forceful collection of </p><p>cash or kind".  The intensified demands belie Maoist </p><p>claims to support the welfare of the people and the </p><p>health of the nation\'s economy.  Extortion erodes </p><p>public and international confidence in the Maoists\' </p><p>sincerity in seeking a stable peace through </p><p>negotiation.  Extortion of money from tourists also </p><p>threatens Nepal\'s international standing and economic </p><p>well-being and should end. </p><p> </p><p>Chambers of Commerce and Industry and their </p><p>international partners, in the interest of the welfare </p><p>of Nepal\'s people and the sanctity of the rule of law </p><p>in the Kingdom, call upon the CPN(M) to end immediately </p><p>these criminal exactions and adhere to all the </p><p>conditions in the Code of Conduct.  The Industrial </p><p>Security Group also urges His Majesty\'s Government to </p><p>make extortion and other violations of the Code of </p><p>Conduct (including interference in schools, </p><p>intimidation of development projects and extortions of </p><p>hospitals, social institutions and tourists) central to </p><p>the next round of peace talks.  The Industrial Security </p><p>Group also urges the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>to make the necessary steps to rejoin legitimate Nepali </p><p>politics. </p><p> </p><p>Note:  The Industrial Security Group comprised of </p><p>bilateral Chambers of Commerce and Industry and </p><p>representatives of the Embassies of France, Germany, </p><p>India, U.K. and the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>This statement is issued by the British Embassy in </p><p>Kathmandu on behalf of the Industrial Security Group of </p><p>which the Embassy is acting Chair. </p><p> </p><p>21 July 2003 </p><p>British Embassy, Kathmandu </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
