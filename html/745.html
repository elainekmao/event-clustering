(U) PARAGRAPHS CLASSIFIED AS MARKED.  OADR FOR </p><p>FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>2. (C) SINN FEIN LEADERS HAVE AUTHORITATIVELY RULED OUT </p><p>ANY DECOMMISSIONING OF WEAPONS -- EVEN A SYMBOLIC </p><p>GESTURE -- UNTIL THE SHAPE OF AN ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT IS CLEAR, AND HAVE DEMANDED THAT HMG </p><p>IMMEDIATELY CONVENE ALL-PARTY TALKS.  THEY SAID THEIR </p><p>EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE WITH HMG WAS FINISHED, BUT LEFT </p><p>OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF MEETINGS WITH BRITISH MINISTERS </p><p>TO PREPARE FOR ALL-PARTY TALKS.  SINN FEIN HAS LAUNCHED </p><p>A CAMPAIGN TO FORGE "PAN-NATIONALIST" CONSENSUS BEHIND </p><p>ITS POSITION, AND TO ISOLATE THE UNIONISTS AND HMG. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>SINN FEIN\'S CAMPAIGN, BUT UNSURE HOW THEY CAN COUNTER </p><p>IT.  THEY DO NOT WANT THE PEACE PROCESS TO BECOME </p><p>STALLED, AND ARE WORRIED BY INTELLIGENCE INDICATING A </p><p>POTENTIAL SPLIT IN THE IRA IN LATE SUMMER/EARLY AUTUMN. </p><p>THEY WANT TO MOVE ON ISSUES AT THE TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN </p><p>GENDA LIKE PRISONERS AND POLICING, BUT SINN FEIN HAS </p><p>REFUSED TO DISCUSS THEM SERIOUSLY.  THE BRITISH INSIST </p><p>THAT SOME MOVEMENT ON DECOMMISSIONING IS ESSENTIAL IF </p><p>UNIONISTS AND TORY MP\'S ARE TO BE KEPT ON BOARD:  THERE </p><p>CAN BE NO ALL-PARTY TALKS WITHOUT AN UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF IRA INTENT NOT TO RESUME VIOLENCE.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) THE BRITISH ARE LESS WORRIED THAN THEIR IRISH </p><p>COUNTERPARTS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  THEY BELIEVE THE IRA WOULD HAVE LITTLE </p><p>COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR A FULL-SCALE RETURN TO TERRORISM </p><p>AND THAT A DEFECTION OF ONE OR MORE IRA BRIGADES COULD </p><p>BE CONTAINED.  THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR POSITION ON </p><p>DECOMMISSIONING IS BOTH RIGHT AND POLITICALLY </p><p>DEFENSIBLE, AND THAT THEY HAVE NO FURTHER ROOM TO </p><p>MANEUVER.  IF THE BRITISH PERSIST, SOMETHING WILL HAVE </p><p>TO GIVE:  EITHER SINN FEIN AND THE IRA WILL FIND A WAY </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO NONVIOLENCE, OR THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WILL BREAK DOWN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NO TO DECOMMISSIONING </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>5. (U) SINN FEIN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SIGNALING FOR OVER </p><p>A MONTH THAT THE IRA WOULD NOT DECOMMISSION ITS ARMS </p><p>UNTIL POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS PRODUCED A BLUEPRINT FOR </p><p>IRELAND\'S FUTURE THAT IT FOUND ACCEPTABLE.  IN A LONG </p><p>ARTICLE IN THE JUNE 14 "IRISH TIMES" (REF A), GERRY </p><p>ADAMS MADE IT OFFICIAL: </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS DEMANDING THE SURRENDER </p><p>     OF IRA WEAPONS AS A PRECONDITION TO ALL-PARTY PEACE </p><p>     TALKS ON THE FUTURE OF IRELAND.  THE LOGIC OF THAT </p><p>     POSITION, IF ADHERED TO, IS THAT THERE WILL BE NO </p><p>     INCLUSIVE PEACE TALKS AND NO DEMOCRATIC SETTLEMENT." </p><p> </p><p>--   "IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>     SIMPLY ASKING FOR A SYMBOLIC GESTURE.  BUT IT IS A </p><p>     GESTURE WHICH WOULD SYMBOLIZE AN IRA SURRENDER.... </p><p>     THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS, IN EFFECT, DEMANDING THE </p><p>     SURRENDER OF THE IRA." </p><p> </p><p>--   "SINN FEIN CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, INVOLVE ITSELF IN </p><p>     A FUTILE EXERCISE TO BRING ABOUT AN IRA SURRENDER." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES, SPEECHES AND INTERVIEWS </p><p>OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, ADAMS AND OTHER SINN FEIN </p><p>LEADERS REPEATED THIS MESSAGE ENDLESSLY.  ON JUNE 17, </p><p>ADAMS TOLD AN INTERVIEWER THAT A RETURN TO VIOLENCE WAS </p><p>"ABSOLUTELY" POSSIBLE, BUT DENIED THE NEXT DAY THAT HE </p><p>HAD INTENDED THIS STATEMENT AS A THREAT.  MARTIN </p><p>MCGUINNESS MADE THE SAME POINTS IN THE ANNUAL WOLFE TONE </p><p>COMMEMORATION SPEECH JUNE 18 (REF B), CALLING HMG\'S </p><p>INSISTENCE ON AT LEAST TOKEN DECOMMISSIONING "DANGEROUS </p><p>AND DISHONORABLE," AND A "CYNICAL GAME."  ADAMS AND </p><p>MCGUINNESS INSISTED THAT SINN FEIN AND THE IRA WERE </p><p>WILLING TO COUNTENANCE DISARMAMENT, BUT ONLY AS PART OF </p><p>A "UNIVERSAL DECOMMISSIONING OF ARMS, BRITISH AND IRISH, </p><p>ONCE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING POLITICAL DISCUSSION AND </p><p>FRAMEWORK IS AGREED UPON." </p><p> </p><p>DEMAND FOR ALL-PARTY TALKS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) THE SINN FEIN LEADERS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD NOT AGREE TO ANY MORE "EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE" </p><p>MEETINGS WITH BRITISH MINISTERS.  NATIONAL CHAIRMAN </p><p>MITCHEL MCLAUGHLIN TOLD THE BBC ON JUNE 12 THAT "WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT WE\'VE COVERED THOSE ISSUES WHICH WERE </p><p>RELEVANT AND LEGITIMATE AND NOW IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON TO </p><p>A COMMITMENT TO OPEN ALL-PARTY TALKS."  MCGUINNESS MADE </p><p>THE SAME POINTS IN HIS JUNE 18 SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>8.   ADAMS, IN HIS "IRISH TIMES" ARTICLE AND WEEKEND </p><p>INTERVIEWS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, ADDED THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--   "ALL-PARTY PEACE TALKS SHOULD BE INITIATED AS A </p><p>     MATTER OF URGENCY AND WITHIN AN AGREED TIME FRAME." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>     DICTATE THE TERMS OF THIS ACCOMMODATION, NOR CAN IT </p><p>     BE ALLOWED TO DETERMINE WHO CAN OR CANNOT </p><p>     PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTITIONS...." </p><p> </p><p>--   "... THE BRITISH HAVE, AS EVER, USED THE CONVENIENT </p><p>     COVER OF THE UNIONISTS.  IN DOING SO THEY ARE </p><p>     ENCOURAGING, RATHER THAN DISCOURAGING, UNIONIST </p><p>     INTRANSIGENCE." </p><p> </p><p>A FEW LOOPHOLES </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9. (C) DESPITE THE CATEGORICAL TONE OF THE SINN FEIN </p><p>STATEMENTS, IT MAY PROVE SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY LEFT OPEN </p><p>A FEW LOOPHOLES THROUGH WHICH THE PARTY MIGHT EVENTUALLY </p><p>SLIDE OFF ITS HARD-LINE POSITION.  THE REJECTIONS OF </p><p>DECOMMISSIONING GENERALLY SET UP A STRAW MAN TO ATTACK: </p><p>ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS REJECTED A UNILATERAL SURRENDER OF </p><p>ALL IRA WEAPONS BEFORE TALKS COULD BEGIN, KNOWING FULL </p><p>WELL THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ON DIALOGUE, THE SINN FEIN LEADERS CAREFULLY </p><p>ALLOWED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS </p><p>UNDER ANOTHER NAME.  SINCE HMG IS ALREADY CONDUCTING ITS </p><p>TALKS WITH BOTH UNIONIST PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS DODGES </p><p>AND LINGUISTIC SUBTERFUGES, THIS NEED NOT BE AN </p><p>INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO CONTINUING THE EXPLORATORY </p><p>DIALOGUE UNDER A NEW NAME. </p><p> </p><p>PAN-NATIONALIST CAMPAIGN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>11. (C) SINN FEIN\'S LOBBYING CAMPAIGN TO GENERATE A </p><p>"PAN-NATIONALIST CONSENSUS" IN SUPPORT OF ITS POSITION </p><p>HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  IT ECHOES THE </p><p>PATTERN OF PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS FOR VISAS AND FUNDRAISING </p><p>PERMISSION, SEEKING FIRST TO WIN OVER SDLP LEADER JOHN </p><p>HUME, IRISH OFFICIALS AND FIANNA FAIL, THEN PUTTING </p><p>PRESSURE THROUGH THEM ON JOHN BRUTON AND DICK SPRING. </p><p>HUME APPEARS TO BE ON BOARD, THOUGH SDLP DEPUTY LEADER </p><p>SEAMUS MALLON URGED THE IRA ON JUNE 16 TO "DO THIS THING </p><p>ON DECOMMISSIONING FOR THE REST OF US, FOR THE IRISH </p><p>PEOPLE AND CALL THE BRITISH BLUFF."  REFS C-E INDICATE </p><p>THAT IRISH OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN WON OVER.  SPRING AND </p><p>BRUTON HAVE WAVERED, AND MEDIA REPORTS INDICATE THAT </p><p>BRUTON HAS PROPOSED AN ANGLO-IRISH STUDY OF MODALITIES </p><p>OF DECOMMISSIONING, PRESUMABLY AS A DELAYING TACTIC. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) A KEY PART OF THE CAMPAIGN IS TO CREATE A </p><p>CLIMATE OF OPINION THAT THE BRITISH AND UNIONIST DEMANDS </p><p>DO NOT MEAN WHAT THEY SAY, THAT DECOMMISSIONING IS BOTH </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE, AND THAT HMG IS ISOLATED </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY.  ADAMS WROTE THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--   "THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL PRECEDENT AND CERTAINLY </p><p>     NO PRECEDENT IN IRELAND FOR THE HANDING OVER OF </p><p>     WEAPONS." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ... WISH TO DEFLECT AND </p><p>     DILUTE THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>     DEMOCRATIC AND NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT BY CREATING AN </p><p>     UNNECESSARY AND DIVISIVE ARGUMENT OVER IRA WEAPONS." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THEY MAY, IN FACT, WISH TO CAUSE DIVISIONS AND </p><p>     FRACTIONS WITHIN THE IRA ITSELF IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>     UNDERMINE THE STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLICAN POSITION. </p><p>     IN SHORT, THEY WISH TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND ALL POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>     WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNIONISTS HAVE CALLED FOR </p><p>     SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN.  THE BRITISH </p><p>     GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO TAKE THIS ESSENTIAL STEP </p><p>     AND IS PREVENTING PROGRESS TOWARDS AN AGREED AND </p><p>     LASTING POLITICAL SETTLEMENT." </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) SIMILARLY, MCLAUGHLIN POINTED TO BRUTON\'S </p><p>INVITATION TO ALL PARTIES TO TALK, AND SAID THIS PROVED </p><p>THAT HMG WAS "THE OBSTACLE TO AGREEMENT ON PEACE IN </p><p>IRELAND."  AND MCGUINNESS CLAIMED THAT "THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>ALL-PARTY PEACE NEGOTIATIONS IN IRELAND WAS SUPPORTED BY </p><p>AN EXPECTANT AND WATCHING WORLD.  ONLY THE BRITISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT STOOD IN THE WAY OF REAL PEACE TALKS." </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) IN ALL THESE STATEMENTS, NONE OF THE SINN FEIN </p><p>SPOKESMEN ACKNOWLEDGED PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S CALL AT THE </p><p>WASHINGTON INVESTMENT CONFERENCE FOR PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>DECOMMISSIONING, OR FORMER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR </p><p>ARIAS\' SIMILAR APPEAL FOR PARAMILITARY DISARMAMENT AT A </p><p>RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE IN BELFAST. </p><p> </p><p>BRITISH PERPLEXED </p><p>----------------- </p><p>15. (C) BRITISH MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS HAVE WATCHED THE </p><p>SINN FEIN CAMPAIGN DEVELOP, BUT ARE AT A LOSS HOW BEST </p><p>TO COUNTER IT.  THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR CURRENT POSITION </p><p>IS BOTH REASONABLE, MORALLY RIGHT AND POLITICALLY </p><p>DEFENSIBLE.  THEY POINT OUT THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--   THEY HAVE TAKEN A LONG SERIES OF STEPS TO DEFUSE </p><p>     CONFRONTATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND HAVE </p><p>     MODIFIED THEIR POSITION REPEATEDLY IN ORDER TO </p><p>     FACILITATE COMPROMISE WITH SINN FEIN. </p><p> </p><p>--   SINN FEIN AND THE IRA, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE </p><p>     OFFERED VIRTUALLY NO SIGNS OF FLEXIBILITY SINCE THE </p><p>     CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p>--   GENUINE NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT TAKE PLACE IN AN </p><p>     ATMOSPHERE OF TERRORIST THREAT AND COERCION. </p><p> </p><p>--   THEY DO NOT SEEK A UNILATERAL SURRENDER OF ALL IRA </p><p>     WEAPONS, BUT ONLY A TOKEN DECOMMISSIONING AS A </p><p>     GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH AS PART OF THE BEGINNING OF A </p><p>     PROCESS OF PHASED, RECIPROCAL DISARMAMENT IN WHICH </p><p>     THEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THEY ARE ASKING NO MORE OF THE IRA THAN THEY ARE OF </p><p>     THE LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES. </p><p> </p><p>--   THEY HAVE NO FURTHER NEGOTIATING LEEWAY.  UNIONISTS </p><p>     OF ALL STRIPES HAVE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT </p><p>     THEY WILL NOT SIT DOWN WITH SINN FEIN WHILE THE IRA </p><p>     REMAINS ON A WAR FOOTING, AND ABANDONING THE DEMAND </p><p>     FOR SOME DECOMMISSIONING WOULD GIVE NEW IMPETUS FOR </p><p>     TORY BACKBENCH DEMANDS FOR MAJOR\'S RESIGNATION. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE (NIO) OFFICIALS TOLD US </p><p>JUNE 15 THAT THEY DID NOT INTEND TO LEAVE ADAMS\' ARTICLE </p><p>UNCHALLENGED, AND WERE PREPARING A REPLY TO IT.  THEY </p><p>HOPED THEY COULD SUSTAIN THE SUPPORT OF BRUTON AND </p><p>SPRING, AS WELL AS THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>READY TO MOVE </p><p>------------- </p><p>17. (S) WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIM </p><p>THAT HMG IS TRYING TO STALL PROGRESS ON THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, AS SINN FEIN AND SOME IRISH OFFICIALS SUGGEST. </p><p>THE BRITISH ARE ANXIOUS TO SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM </p><p>GENERATED BY THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE.  THEY HAVE </p><p>OFFERED SINN FEIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE ANY ISSUE IT </p><p>WANTS IN THE EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE, AND TO MEET WITH ANY </p><p>NIO MINISTER ON APPROPRIATE ISSUES -- PUTTING SINN FEIN </p><p>EFFECTIVELY ON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE NONVIOLENT </p><p>PARTIES.  THEY BELIEVE THE LOYALISTS ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>MOVE ON DECOMMISSIONING IF THE IRA DOES SO.  AND THEY </p><p>ARE READY TO AUTHORIZE THE WITHDRAWAL OF MORE BRITISH </p><p>ARMY BATTALIONS AS SOON AS CONDITIONS PERMIT. </p><p> </p><p>18. (S) THE BRITISH ALSO SHARE THE WORRIES OF THEIR </p><p>IRISH COUNTERPARTS ABOUT A POSSIBLE SPLIT WITHIN THE IRA </p><p>IF THERE IS NO FURTHER PROGRESS BEFORE THE AUGUST </p><p>CEASEFIRE.  INTELLIGENCE REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE IS </p><p>MIXED.  SOME REPORTS INDICATE THAT ONE OR MORE IRA </p><p>BRIGADES MAY DEFECT IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER.  OTHER </p><p>REPORTS, HOWEVER, INDICATE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>CEASEFIRE IN REPUBLICAN COMMUNITIES CONTINUES TO </p><p>SOLIDIFY, AND THAT THE IRA WOULD FACE GREAT DIFFICULTIES </p><p>IN RESUMING FULL-SCALE VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) FOR THIS REASON, THE BRITISH HAVE BEEN TRYING TO </p><p>ENGAGE SINN FEIN ON ISSUES PRESUMED TO BE AT THE TOP OF </p><p>ITS AGENDA:  PRISONERS, POLICING, AND ECONOMIC </p><p>REGENERATION.  UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE EXPLORATORY </p><p>DIALOGUE SINN FEIN HAS REFUSED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES </p><p>IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.  A SENIOR NIO OFFICIAL TOLD US </p><p>JUNE 15 THAT SINN FEIN, WHILE COMPLAINING ABOUT HMG\'S </p><p>"SINGLE ISSUE AGENDA," HAD ITSELF REFUSED TO DISCUSS ANY </p><p>SUBJECT EXCEPT DECOMMISSIONING (IN ORDER TO REJECT IT). </p><p> </p><p>20. (S) THE BRITISH, HOWEVER, DO NOT FULLY SHARE THEIR </p><p>IRISH COUNTERPARTS\' SENSE OF URGENCY.  AS NOTED ABOVE, </p><p>THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE THREAT OF A FULL-SCALE </p><p>RESUMPTION OF THE IRA\'S TERRORIST CAMPAIGN IS CREDIBLE </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE TRANSFORMATION IN COMMUNITY ATTITUDES. </p><p>THE DEFECTION OF ONE OR MORE IRA BRIGADES WOULD BE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE, BUT SHOULD BE CONTAINABLE AND NEED NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY END THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY ARE MORE </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE IRA WOULD CONDUCT </p><p>A PARTIAL RESUMPTION OF ITS BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN GREAT </p><p>BRITAIN ONLY, BUT BELIEVE THAT CAVING IN TO REPUBLICAN </p><p>DEMANDS NOW WOULD BE BOTH FUTILE AND MORE DANGEROUS IN </p><p>THE LONG TERM. </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION SUPPORT </p><p>------------------ </p><p>21. (U) JOHN HUME CLAIMED JUNE 19 THAT HMG WAS STALLING </p><p>ON TALKS BECAUSE OF "INTERNAL SQUABBLING" OVER THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.  THIS IS NOT OUR </p><p>ASSESSMENT:  THERE IS NO DISSENT WITHIN THE TORY PARTY </p><p>OVER THE NEED FOR DECOMMISSIONING, AND THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ALSO ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE MAIN OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES.  AFTER MEETING FIANNA FAIL LEADER BERTIE AHERNE </p><p>IN LONDON JUNE 19, LABOUR LEADER TONY BLAIR SAID: </p><p>LABOUR ENTIRELY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT\'S EMPHASIS ON </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE TO AVOID DEADLOCK </p><p>IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND THEIR INSISTENCE THAT, BEFORE </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE TALKS CAN TAKE PLACE, BOTH REPUBLICAN AND </p><p>LOYALIST REPRESENTATIVES MUST ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>DECOMMISSIONING OF ARMS, AGREE ON THE MEANS AND SIGNAL </p><p>THE START OF THE PROCESS AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH."  HE </p><p>HAS MADE SIMILAR STATEMENTS TO THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) SHADOW NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY MO MOWLAM </p><p>REITERATED THIS POSITION TO US JUNE 20.  SHE SAID THAT, </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW ON THE FAR LEFT FRINGE OF </p><p>THE PARTY, LABOUR ACCEPTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>TAKING THE RIGHT LINE ON THE POLITICS OF NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND.  IF LABOUR CAME TO POWER IN THE NEAR FUTURE, </p><p>ITS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT, BUT ITS POLITICAL </p><p>POLICY WOULD BE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CURRENT ONE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>23. (C) WHILE ALL BRITISH OFFICIALS, AND ALL UNIONIST </p><p>PARTIES, HAVE TOLD US THAT SOME DECOMMISSIONING OF IRA </p><p>ARMS IS ESSENTIAL IF FURTHER PROGRESS IS TO BE MADE, </p><p>MOST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DECOMMISSIONING PER SE IS NOT THE </p><p>REAL ISSUE.  POLICE AND ARMY OFFICIALS HAVE ADMITTED, </p><p>MORE OR LESS PUBLICLY, THAT THE IRA COULD EASILY REPLACE </p><p>ANY TOKEN AMOUNT OF AGING WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES IT </p><p>CHOSE TO GIVE UP AT THIS POINT.  ITS MOST DAMAGING </p><p>ATTACKS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE EMPLOYED HOMEMADE WEAPONS, </p><p>ON WHICH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES.  BUT </p><p>GETTING RID OF ANY AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, HOWEVER OBSOLETE, </p><p>WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FIRST GENUINE DEMONSTRATION OF THE </p><p>INTENT OF THE CURRENT IRA LEADERSHIP NOT TO RESUME THE </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT.  AS CHURCH OF IRELAND PRELATE ROBIN </p><p>EAMES TOLD THE DUBLIN PEACE FORUM RECENTLY, THE KEY IS </p><p>FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO FOSTER A CLIMATE OF TRUST "BY </p><p>SHOWING THAT WE CAN BELIEVE YOUR WORDS." </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) WE CAN SEE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE </p><p>CURRENT STALEMATE: </p><p> </p><p>--   SINN FEIN AND THE IRA COULD CONCLUDE THAT </p><p>     DECOMMISSIONING WAS ESSENTIAL AND BEGIN THE </p><p>     PROCESS.  THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT INTERNALLY, AND </p><p>     MIGHT RESULT IN SOME DEFECTIONS, BUT WOULD UNLOCK THE </p><p>     DOOR TO RAPID MOVEMENT ON SEVERAL OTHER FRONTS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE REPUBLICANS COULD FIND AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF </p><p>     DEMONSTRATING THEIR INTENT TO END VIOLENCE FOR </p><p>     GOOD.  THEY COULD CONVENE A GENERAL ARMY CONVENTION </p><p>     TO DECLARE AN END TO THE ARMED STRUGGLE, OR ISSUE A </p><p>     UNANIMOUS PROVISIONAL ARMY COUNCIL STATEMENT TO THE </p><p>     SAME EFFECT.  THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE ENOUGH TO </p><p>     RENDER THE WEAPONS ISSUE IRRELEVANT IN MOST EYES, </p><p>     BUT MIGHT BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR REPUBLICAN </p><p>     ACTIVISTS TO ACCEPT. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE IRA COULD USE THE IMPASSE AS A PRETEXT TO </p><p>     RESUME ITS ARMED CAMPAIGN.  THIS IS UNLIKELY, </p><p>     BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY REACTION WOULD RISK FAILURE </p><p>     AND COLLAPSE.  MORE LIKELY WOULD BE A LIMITED </p><p>     NUMBER OF DEMONSTRATION BOMBINGS IN ENGLAND. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG COULD CAVE IN, DROP ITS INSISTENCE ON </p><p>     DECOMMISSIONING AND CALL ALL-PARTY TALKS.  THE </p><p>     UNIONISTS WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY REJECT NOT ONLY THE </p><p>     TALKS BUT ANY FURTHER DEALINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>     AND THEIR FRIENDS ON THE TORY BACKBENCHES WOULD </p><p>     REBEL, THUS BRINGING TO AN ABRUPT END THE POLITICAL </p><p>     PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND POSSIBLY THE MAJOR </p><p>     GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE STALEMATE COULD CONTINUE FOR MANY MONTHS.  IF </p><p>     THE CEASEFIRE HELD (BY NO MEANS A SURE BET), </p><p>     UNIONISTS MIGHT EVENTUALLY ACCEPT SINN FEIN\'S </p><p>     COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND HMG COULD MOVE TOWARD </p><p>     ALL-PARTY TALKS.  SINN FEIN COULD TRUMPET THIS AS A </p><p>     VICTORY, BUT THE RISKS OF LOST MOMENTUM AND RISING </p><p>     ANGER ON BOTH SIDES WOULD BE VERY SEVERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROWE </p><p></p></div>
