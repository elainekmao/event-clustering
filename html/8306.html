(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This is an action request, please see para </p><p>4. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Embassy has received calls in the last </p><p>two days from a number of Iraqi citizens resident </p><p>in the UAE requesting urgent information on how </p><p>they should go about renewing their Iraqi </p><p>passports.   Polchief confirmed 5/28 with a </p><p>resident Iraqi citizen doctor that the Iraqi </p><p>Embassy in Abu Dhabi ceased all consular operations </p><p>earlier this week.  The Iraqis who have contacted </p><p>us are worried that their inability to renew their </p><p>passports will jeopardize their residency status in </p><p>the UAE and make it impossible for them to travel </p><p>outside the country.  The Iraqis have already </p><p>approached the UAE authorities, who in turn have </p><p>directed them to the U.S. Embassy for answers.  The </p><p>UAE hosts a large Iraqi population, estimated at </p><p>approximately 30,000.   We imagine other posts with </p><p>large Iraqi communities will receive similar </p><p>queries and that, absent answers, this issue will </p><p>make its way into the local and, possibly, the </p><p>international press. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ACTION REQUEST: Understanding the </p><p>complexities of this issue, we request the </p><p>Department\'s guidance at the earliest possible </p><p>opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
