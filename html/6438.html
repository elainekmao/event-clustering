<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, PGOV, GT, OAS, BZ </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALAN MFA DISCUSSES FUTURE OF BORDER TALKS </p><p>WITH BELIZE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a March 11 meeting with PolCouns and PolOff, the </p><p>Belize Border Commission of the Guatemalan MFA said that </p><p>resolution of the long-running border dispute would be passed </p><p>along to the new Guatemalan government that will take office </p><p>in January, 2004, and said the new government will have to </p><p>decide if it submits the Facilitators\' recommendations to a </p><p>national referendum, or if it opts for seeking an opinion </p><p>from the ICJ or an arbitration.  The Guatemalan diplomats </p><p>believe that a referendum now would fail, and said </p><p>Guatemalans\' "spiritual" attachment to Belize will make this </p><p>referendum "a challenge" even for a new government.  They </p><p>said that the MFA will try to keep the Belize issue from </p><p>becoming part of the partisan political debate during this </p><p>electoral year, and would focus its efforts in the remainder </p><p>of the year on implementation of the confidence and security </p><p>building measures.  The Guatemalans were pleased with the </p><p>decision of the OAS to place a permanent observer on the </p><p>border, and believe this will help reduce incidents that lead </p><p>to border tensions.  They noted that many of the incidents </p><p>are driven by pervasive poverty in the border areas, and </p><p>argued for international assistance to address poverty </p><p>concerns in those zones. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloffs noted that the international community had </p><p>placed a lot of hope in the OAS Facilitators\' process, and </p><p>were disappointed when no action was taken on the </p><p>recommendations.  In an era of growing globalization, it is </p><p>critical that countries overcome the obstacles to greater </p><p>integration, such as Guatemala\'s border differences with </p><p>Belize.  Greater integration brings benefits for both sides, </p><p>and delaying the resolution of differences -- as would occur </p><p>if the matter is referred to the ICJ -- would needlessly </p><p>delay Guatemala and Belize reaping the profits of greater </p><p>economic integration.  The Guatemalans acknowledged the </p><p>point, and said the GOG would seek an expedited process at </p><p>the ICJ or from arbitrators in the event the new government </p><p>should not believe it could win a national referendum on the </p><p>Facilitators\' recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a separate meeting with the local OAS office </p><p>Director, Ambassador Jose Felix Palma, Poloffs discussed </p><p>implementation of the permanent observer mission.  Palma said </p><p>installation of the office was taking more time than </p><p>anticipated.  All sides have agreed that bringing in a </p><p>pre-fabricated structure will be necessary due to lack of </p><p>suitable infrastructure and facilities in the border area. </p><p>Palma estimates the observer mission will be operational by </p><p>mid-April, but cautioned that the date could slip if a </p><p>suitable director and assistant cannot be found.  Palma said </p><p>the candidate pool was somewhat limited since the director </p><p>would need to be someone senior enough to command respect, </p><p>but willing to live in the relatively remote border area. </p><p>Palma also said the director would probably have to be from </p><p>South America.  He expects that the observer mission will </p><p>eventually be made up of 4 - 5 people. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
