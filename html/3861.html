PROSPECTS FOR THE CURRENT MAIN "KIREMTI" </p><p>HARVEST CROPS AND REGENERATION OF PASTURES ARE POOR </p><p>FOLLOWING SEVERE AND PROLONGED DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MOST GRAIN PRODUCTIVE AREAS. WIDESPREAD DROUGHT </p><p>WILL EXACERBATE A FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION ALREADY STRESSED BY </p><p>DISPLACEMENT OF WAR-AFFECTED POPULATIONS, THE INFLUX OF </p><p>DEPORTEES FROM ETHIOPIA, AND THE CONTINUING REPATRIATION OF </p><p>REFUGEES FROM SUDAN. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04756  01 OF 03  020545Z </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. USMISSION/ROME HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE TIM LAVELLE VISITED </p><p>ERITREA SEPTEMBER 20-26, 2002, AND TRAVELED WITH THE </p><p>ERITREAN RELIEF AND REFUGEE COMMISSION\'S (ERREC) DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR RELIEF AND LOGISTICS IBRAHIM SAID, WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM COUNTRY DIRECTOR PATRICK BUCKLEY (IRISH CITIZEN) AND </p><p>STAFF (THE TRIP\'S ABLE FACILITATOR) AND UNHCR FIELD OFFICERS </p><p>THOUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING REGIONS: ANSEBA, GASH BARCA AND </p><p>DEDUB. THE TEAM LOGGED 1,067 KILOMETERS BY ROAD OVER FOUR </p><p>DAYS, IN ORDER TO ACCESS FIRST HAND THE PRESENT DROUGHT </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN GENERAL, ERITREA SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC FOOD SHORTAGES. </p><p>IN GOOD YEARS, THE COUNTRY PRODUCES ONLY ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF </p><p>ITS TOTAL FOOD NEEDS AND IN POORER YEARS NO MORE THAN 50 </p><p>PERCENT. INSOFAR AS MOST FARMERS IN ERITREA PRACTICE RAINFED </p><p>AGRICULTURE, FARMERS ARE CONSISTENTLY FACED WITH ANNUAL </p><p>FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH OUTPUT AND PRICES. EVEN IN GOOD YEARS, </p><p>MOST SMALL FARMERS DO NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES FOR MORE THAN SIX-NINE MONTHS. THIS MEANS THAT FARM </p><p>FAMILIES NEED ACCESS TO NON-FARM INCOME OR TO FOOD AID TO </p><p>SUBSIST. </p><p> </p><p>4. AS A RESULT OF PERIODIC FOOD SHORTAGES, CHILD </p><p>MALNUTRITION IS HIGH. ABOUT 38 PERCENT OF CHILDREN UNDER </p><p>FIVE ARE STUNTED (LOW HEIGHT FOR AGE), 16 PERCENT ARE WASTED </p><p>(LOW WEIGHT FOR AGE), AND 44 PERCENT OF CHILDREN ARE </p><p>UNDERWEIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04756  01 OF 03  020545Z </p><p>5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN RURAL AREAS IS GENERALLY </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY LOW PRODUCTIVITY. GIVEN THE LACK OF </p><p>AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICES AND CREDIT, POOR FARM-TO- </p><p>MARKET ROADS, ETC., THERE IS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS </p><p>SITUATION IS GOING TO AMELIORATE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. </p><p>THE FAO OPINES THAT "THE GREEN REVOLUTION HAS BYPASSED </p><p>ERITREA." </p><p> </p><p>6. AS A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT POLICY, INTERNATIONAL NGOS ARE </p><p>RELEGATED LARGELY TO NON-IMPLEMENTATIVE ROLES. GIVEN THE </p><p>DEARTH OF TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED ERITREANS BOTH WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL NGO SECTOR, PROJECT DESIGN AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION CAN BE A SLOW PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WHERE WE ARE AT PRESENT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. POOR RAINS THIS YEAR HAVE DISRUPTED THE TWO PLANTING </p><p>SEASONS AND THE SITUATION HAS BEEN FURTHER AGGRAVATED BY </p><p>ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE REGENERATION OF ESSENTIAL </p><p>PASTURELANDS AND GROUND-WATER SUPPLIES. AN ESTIMATED ONE </p><p>MILLION ERITREANS, 80-90 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE LIVING IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS, ARE EXPECTED TO BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE 2002 </p><p>DROUGHTS.

END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>OTHER FACTORS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. THE GOVERNMENT OF DENMARK ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY 2002 A </p><p>RADICAL DOWNSIZING IN ITS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO ERITREA </p><p>(TO BE TERMINATED FULLY IN 2005). THIS HAS SUBSTANTIVELY </p><p>IMPACTED ON THE 2002-OPERATING BUDGET OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>(GSE) MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE. MOREOVER, ERITREA CONTINUES </p><p>TO DEAL WITH APPROXIMATELY 60,000 INTERNALLY DISPLACED </p><p>(LIVING IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS) AND RESETTLING SOME 100,000 </p><p>REPATRIATED RETURNEES. FINALLY, WHILE THE HIV PREVALENCE </p><p>RATE IS PRESENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 3 PERCENT AMONG </p><p>ADULTS, THERE IS CONCERN THAT HIV/AIDS AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS </p><p>NEED TO BE INTENSIFIED PARTICULARLY FOR NATIONAL SERVICE </p><p>PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO PREVENT FUTURE ECONOMIC IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04756  02 OF 03  020545Z </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. FOOD TONNAGE AND BENEFICIARY NUMBERS WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>FURTHER REFINED BY A FINAL CROP ASSESSMENT IN OCTOBER (AFTER </p><p>THE RAINS STOP). RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE FINAL CROP </p><p>ASSESSMENT MISSION REPORT, HOWEVER, DONORS SHOULD RESPOND </p><p>WITH AN IMMEDIATE PLEDGING AND DISPATCH OF ADEQUATE </p><p>QUANTITIES OF FOOD AID, TO ARRIVE BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF </p><p>THE "HUNGRY SEASON" IN FEBRUARY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>12. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE </p><p>SYSTEM IN COLLABORATION WITH WFP AND ITS UN AGENCY PARTNERS </p><p>IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. THIS WILL BE A VITAL STEP IN </p><p>DETERMINING THE INCIDENCE, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, AND </p><p>EXTENT OF CHRONIC AND SEASONAL MALNUTRITION, INCLUDING </p><p>VULNERABILITY PROFILES BY GENDER, BACKGROUND AND AGE. </p><p> </p><p>13. DONORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK WITH THE GSE ON IMPROVING </p><p>THE NATIONAL CAPACITY TO COMMERCIALLY IMPORT FOOD ON TIME TO </p><p>WHERE IT IS NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>14. ERITREA NEEDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO ENHANCE ITS CAPACITY </p><p>TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DROUGHT "CLIMATOLOGY" OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY AND STRENGTHEN ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE DROUGHT RISKS. </p><p> </p><p>15.
