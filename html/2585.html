(C) SUMMARY.  THE GOZ HAS TO A LARGE DEGREE </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN ITS EFFORTS TO KEEP PRYING OUTSIDE EYES </p><p>AWAY FROM THE PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN FIELD AND, IT NOW </p><p>APPEARS, OUT OF THE POLLING STATIONS ON VOTING DAY.  BY </p><p>DERAILING THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MISSION AND </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE ELECTIONS SUPPORT NETWORK (ZESN) DOMESTIC </p><p>OBSERVERS, THE GOZ HAS ASSURED SPOTTY COVERAGE BUT HAS </p><p>ALSO, INADVERTENTLY OR NOT, STRIPPED ITSELF OF ANY FIG </p><p>LEAF AGAINST POST-ELECTION CHARGES THAT THE ELECTION WAS </p><p>NOT PROPERLY OBSERVED.  THOSE OBSERVERS OUT IN THE </p><p>FIELD, AS OPPOSED TO HARARE\'S LUXURY HOTELS, RANGE FROM </p><p>CRITICS TO OBJECTIVISTS TO APOLOGISTS.  A NUMBER OF SADC </p><p>BILATERAL DELEGATIONS HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THEIR PRO-ZANU- </p><p>PF COLORS, AND THE FINAL STANCES OF LARGER AFRICAN </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS NIGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA REMAIN </p><p>UNCERTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE EMBASSY\'S OWN MODEST IN-HOUSE EFFORT HAS </p><p>BEEN AS OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE IN COVERAGE.  WE EXPECT </p><p>THAT ALL OF THE CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT EMERGE IN THE WAKE </p><p>OF THE ELECTIONS WILL ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT INSTANCES OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00620  01 OF 05  081222Z </p><p>INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE, AND ELECTORAL CHICANERY.  THE </p><p>STATEMENT BY THE USG ON THE OUTCOME WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>SUPPORTED BY FACT THAT WE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT OUR </p><p>STATEMENT WILL NOT BE UNDERCUT BY WHITEWASHING OR LACK </p><p>OF DETAIL IN REPORTS FROM OTHER, LESS RELIABLE </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE EARLY CASUALTIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOZ HAS PURSUED A DUAL STRATEGY OF BLOCKAGE </p><p>AND "DIVIDE AND CONQUER" IN ITS EFFORTS TO KEEP </p><p>POTENTIALLY UNSYMPATHETIC ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSIONS </p><p>OUT OF THE FRAY.  THE FIRST CASUALTY WAS THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (IFES), </p><p>WHICH WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY EXPELLED LAST SEPTEMBER IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE OF ITS ASSESSMENT MISSION.  SUBSEQUENT CAT-AND- </p><p>MOUSING WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON LED </p><p>NOWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE EU AND ITS PROPOSED 150-STRONG TEAM OF </p><p>OBSERVERS WERE NEXT.  THE GOZ SOUGHT TO CREATE A </p><p>NORDIC/MEDITERRANEAN RIFT (AND SUCCEEDED TO SOME DEGREE) </p><p>BY ALLOWING ONLY NINE MEMBER STATES TO SEND BILATERAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE TITULAR AUTHORITY OF THE ACP. </p><p>WHEN THE EU ACQUIESCED TO SOME DEGREE AND SOUGHT A </p><p>COMPROMISE SOLUTION, THE GOZ RESPONDED BY EXPELLING EU </p><p>MISSION HEAD PIERRE SCHORRI.  THE REMAINDER OF THE </p><p>DELEGATION SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW, AND THE EU MISSIONS </p><p>LOCATED HERE, IN A FINAL IRONIC GESTURE OF SOLIDARITY, </p><p>AGREED THAT NONE OF THEIR NUMBER WOULD SEEK </p><p>ACCREDITATION TO OBSERVE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00620  01 OF 05  081222Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE NEXT VICTIM WAS ZESN, WHICH HAD TRAINED AND </p><p>LOCATED FUNDING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF 14,000 LOCAL </p><p>MONITORS, THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE FORCE IN PROVIDING </p><p>NATIONWIDE COVERAGE.  THE GOZ DID NOT SO MUCH MOVE THE </p><p>GOAL POST ON THIS ATTEMPT AS CHOP IT DOWN.  AFTER </p><p>ACCREDITING A HANDFUL OF SYMPATHETIC "OBSERVERS," </p><p>INCLUDING WAR VETS, THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>AGREED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTIONS TO ACCREDIT A TOTAL </p><p>OF 420 ZESN OBSERVERS, ONE OBSERVER PER EACH TEN POLLING </p><p>STATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) LAST DITCH ATTEMPTS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER ENDED WITH HIS NO-SHOW AT A FINAL </p><p>SCHEDULED SESSION.  ZESN IS CONSIDERING DEPLOYING </p><p>OBSERVERS WITHOUT CREDENTIALS TO OBSERVE EVENTS FROM 100 </p><p>METERS DISTANT FROM THE POLLING STATION, AS PRESCRIBED </p><p>BY THE ELECTORAL LAW.  WHILE SYMBOLIC, SUCH DEPLOYMENT </p><p>HAS LITTLE REAL VALUE.  AND, ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, </p><p>THERE ARE REPORTS FROM NIGERIA OBSERVERS THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>RUN ACROSS ACCREDITED ZANU-PF OBSERVERS ALREADY DEPLOYED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5969 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00620  02 OF 05  081222Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------716EB2  081223Z /38 </p><p>O 081214Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1141 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ACCRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 HARARE 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>CAPETOWN PLEASE PASS A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/03 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00620  02 OF 05  081222Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OUR TAKE ON ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORTS </p><p>         IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>TO THE FIELD. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT\'S LEFT </p><p>----------- </p><p>7.  (C) BY MAINTAINING FOREIGN MINISTRY CONTROL OVER </p><p>WHAT ORGANIZATIONS/COUNTRIES WERE INVITED, THE GOZ HAS </p><p>MANAGED TO BRING IN SEVERAL HUNDRED MONITORS FROM TWO </p><p>DOZEN DIFFERENT POINTS.  THE GOZ\'S INSISTENCE THAT UNDP </p><p>SHOULD NOT PLAY A COORDINATING ROLE HAS ENSURED THAT </p><p>THERE WOULD BE NO CENTRAL COORDINATION, ALTHOUGH THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN AD HOC COORDINATION AMONG THE MORE SERIOUS </p><p>GROUPS.  DELAYS WITH INVITATIONS AND A CUMBERSOME </p><p>CREDENTIALING PROCEDURE HAVE FURTHER SLOWED THE ARRIVAL </p><p>AND DEPLOYMENT OF OBSERVERS TO THE FIELD.  LATECOMERS, </p><p>MANY OF THEM WITH QUESTIONABLE OBSERVER CREDENTIALS, </p><p>HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE TO ENGAGE IN MUCH MORE THAN </p><p>ELECTORAL TOURISM.  WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT 24 HOURS </p><p>BEFORE THE POLLS ARE SLATED TO OPEN, THE LUXURY HOTELS </p><p>OF HARARE REMAIN CRAMMED WITH UNDEPLOYED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS OF VARIOUS STRIPE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE VAST MAJORITY OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ARE </p><p>AFRICAN, AN INTEGRAL PART OF MUGABE\'S STRATEGY TO </p><p>PORTRAY THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL ISSUE AS WHITE COLONIALIST </p><p>LAND HOLDERS VERSUS INDIGENOUS BLACK AFRICAN PEASANTS </p><p>SEEKING TO REGAIN THEIR AFRICAN BIRTHRIGHT.  MUGABE HAS </p><p>SOUGHT TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER ON ANOTHER LEVEL BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00620  02 OF 05  081222Z </p><p>PORTRAYING WESTERN CRITICISM OF ELECTORAL VIOLENCE AND </p><p>THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A MANIFESTATION OF </p><p>SUPPORT BY WHITES FOR WHITES.  THIS HAS RESONATED TO </p><p>SOME DEGREE WITHIN AFRICA.  TO DATE, MOST COUNTRIES AND </p><p>AFRICAN MULTILATERAL GROUPS HAVE PUBLICLY TAKEN A SOFT </p><p>LINE.  THE GOZ ALSO MANAGED TO DRIVE A WEDGE INTO CHOGM, </p><p>WITH AFRICAN AND WESTERN STATES DIVIDED AND FORCED INTO </p><p>A COMPROMISE TO ACT AFTER THE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THERE WILL BE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW AS THERE </p><p>ARE GROUPS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE VOTE.  SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>SADC STATE DELEGATIONS WILL SERVE AS APOLOGISTS FOR THE </p><p>ZANU-PF VICTORY THAT THEY CLEARLY FAVOR.  OTHERS, SUCH </p><p>AS THE NORWEGIANS, WILL HEW TO A HARDER, MORE OBJECTIVE </p><p>LINE.  IN BETWEEN REMAIN THE OTHERS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE </p><p>NOT GIVEN A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHERE THEY WILL COME </p><p>DOWN.  OUR PREDICTIONS, ADMITTEDLY INTUITIVE, FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA OBSERVATION MISSION (SAOM)_ </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>10.  (C) THE LARGEST OBSERVER MISSION BY FAR, SAOM IS </p><p>HARD TO SUM UP DUE TO ITS DISPARATE NATURE.  UNIONISTS, </p><p>ANC REPRESENTATIVES, OPPOSITION FIGURES, AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS ALL FIGURE INTO THIS.  SEVERAL CHURCH </p><p>AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS WERE REFUSED CREDENTIALS AND </p><p>FORCED TO RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA, IN YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE </p><p>OF GOZ DIVIDE AND CONQUER.  SOME SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATES </p><p>HAVE TAKEN A HARD LINE WITH US IN PRIVATE ON ZANU-PF. </p><p>OTHERS HAVE EVINCED PUBLIC SYMPATHY TOWARD MUGABE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00620  02 OF 05  081222Z </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) TO ACCEPT WHATEVER OUTCOME </p><p>IS ANNOUNCED, NO MATTER HOW TILTED THE ELECTION FIELD </p><p>MIGHT HAVE BEEN. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SAOM HEAD RETURNED HOME </p><p>FOR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WIDELY DIVERGENT </p><p>VIEWS OF HIS GROUP; HE WAS SENT BACK WITH THE </p><p>INSTRUCTION TO FIND A CONSENSUS.  A FURTHER COMPLICATION </p><p>IS THE HEAVY PRESENCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>ON THE SADC-PF, COMMONWEALTH, AND OAU DELEGATIONS. </p><p>GIVEN THIS COMPLEX LINE-UP, IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE </p><p>WHERE THE SOUTH AFRICANS WILL COME OUT, EITHER BY GROUP </p><p>OR COLLECTIVELY.  HOWEVER, BASED ON STATEMENTS </p><p>QUESTIONING THE MDC\'S ABILITY TO GOVERN ZIMBABWE, WE DO </p><p>NOT EXPECT THE SOUTH AFRICANS TO TAKE A HARD-LINE IF </p><p>ZANU-PF IS ANNOUNCED THE VICTOR, ALTHOUGH THEY WILL </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY CRITICIZE VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION, AND </p><p>PROCEDURAL FLAWS. </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5970 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00620  03 OF 05  081223Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------716EBF  081223Z /38 </p><p>O 081214Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1142 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ACCRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 HARARE 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>CAPETOWN PLEASE PASS A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/03 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00620  03 OF 05  081223Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OUR TAKE ON ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORTS </p><p>         IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>12.  (C) CHIEF ERNEST SHONEKAN LED APPROXIMATELY 20 </p><p>NIGERIAN OBSERVERS TO THE FIELD LESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE </p><p>THE ELECTION WAS TO TAKE PLACE.  THEY HAVE DEPLOYED TO </p><p>THE FIELD AND HAVE WITNESSED SOME OF THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES FIRST-HAND, ACCORDING TO </p><p>REPORTS FROM ACCOMPANYING NIGERIAN DIPLOMATS.  NIGERIA </p><p>IS ALSO WELL REPRESENTED ON THE COMMONWEALTH DELEGATION. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH SHONEKAN WAS NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY REASSURING (SEPTEL), AND WE CANNOT AT THIS </p><p>JUNCTURE TELL WHERE THE NIGERIANS WILL COME OUT ON THE </p><p>COMPORTMENT OF THE ELECTIONS, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO </p><p>REPRESENT A NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION OF WHAT POSTURE </p><p>TO TAKE.   PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S PRESENCE ON THE THREE- </p><p>PERSON COMMONWEALTH REVIEW PANEL WILL ENSURE THAT </p><p>WHATEVER THE OUTCOME, THE NIGERIANS WILL REMAIN CLOSELY </p><p>ENGAGED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMONWEALTH </p><p>------------ </p><p>13.  (C) THE COMMONWEALTH HAS MARSHALED THE LARGEST </p><p>MULTILATERAL MISSION, ABOUT 100 STRONG.  THEY WERE THE </p><p>FIRST INTO THE FIELD AND HAVE THE STRONGEST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.  THE MISSION LEADER, </p><p>ABDULSALAMI ABUBAKAR HAS MADE AT LEAST ONE REGRETTABLE </p><p>PUBLIC COMMENT IN WHICH HE IMPLIED THAT JOURNALISTS WERE </p><p>EXAGGERATING THE AMOUNT OF ELECTORAL VIOLENCE.  THE GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00620  03 OF 05  081223Z </p><p>RAN THIS STATEMENT THROUGH ITS PROPAGANDA MILL, </p><p>PROMPTING A STIFF COMMONWEALTH COMMUNIQUE COMPLAINING </p><p>THAT ABUBAKAR HAD BEEN TAKEN OUR OF CONTEXT.  THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF AUSTRALIANS, NEW ZEALANDERS, AND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF CARIBBEAN STATES WILL PROBABLY </p><p>PREVENT ABUBAKAR FROM GLOSSING OVER THE PROBLEMS OF THE </p><p>ELECTION, WHATEVER HIS PERSONAL INCLINATION MIGHT BE. </p><p> </p><p>AU/OAU </p><p>------ </p><p>14.  (C) THERE ARE RELIABLE REPORTS THAT THE AU </p><p>DELEGATION HEAD HAD ATTEMPTED TO BROKER A COMMON, PRO- </p><p>MUGABE STATEMENT FOR THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD, AN EFFORT </p><p>THAT HAS THUS FAR NOT TAKEN ROOT.  GIVING THE HEAD OF </p><p>DELEGATION\'S SIMPERING STATEMENTS FOLLOWING A MEETING </p><p>WITH MUGABE, BROADCAST ON THE NEWS THAT PAST TWO NIGHTS, </p><p>WE HAVE VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS.

MISSION LEADER DUKE LEFHOKO </p><p>FROM BOTSWANA HAS BEEN THE MOST OUTSPOKEN OF THE </p><p>AFRICANS, CRITICIZING THE "STATE OF FEAR" THROUGHOUT </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND NOT PULLING HIS PUNCHES IN PRESS </p><p>INTERVIEWS.  NAMIBIAN OPPOSITION MP NORA SCHIMMING-CHASE </p><p>HAS ALSO BEEN A FORCE TO RECKON WITH.

SADC SYG MUTUKWA, WHO IS </p><p>INTERESTED IN A SECOND TERM, HAS BEEN WALKING A </p><p>TIGHTROPE BETWEEN HIS SADC COUNTERPARTS AND THE WESTERN </p><p>SOURCES OF FUNDING.

NAMIBIAN TEAM </p><p>LEADER MBUENDE, WHO AS FAR AS WE KNOW HAS NOT STRAYED </p><p>FAR FROM HIS HOTEL, HAD ALREADY BEEN QUOTED IN GOZ </p><p>PAPERS AS SAYING THAT REPORTS OF VIOLENCE ARE </p><p>EXAGGERATED, AND BOTH SIDES EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE.

THEY ARE NOW </p><p>DEPLOYING BACK TO THE FIELD FOR OBSERVATION DURING THE </p><p>VOTING PROCESS.

OUR TEAMS </p><p>HAVE BEEN STOPPED AT ROADBLOCKS, MENACED ON A FEW </p><p>OCCASIONS, AND GIVEN SEATS OF HONOR AT ZANU-PF RALLIES </p><p>ON OTHERS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR EFFORTS </p><p>HAS BEEN TO COMPILE A CREDIBLE OVERVIEW OF THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION ENVIRONMENT.  WE WILL REPORT OUR CONCLUSIONS </p><p>SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>23.  (C) IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT DUE TO GOZ </p><p>SHENANIGANS, THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN INADEQUATE.  ONLY FOUR OF THE </p><p>GROUPS INVOLVED -- COMMONWEALTH, SAOM, US, AND SADC-PF -- </p><p>HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD FOR A </p><p>SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE ABLE TO DRAW ACCURATE CONCLUSIONS, </p><p>IF THESE GROUPS SO CHOOSE.  ELECTION DAY WILL BE EQUALLY </p><p>HIT AND MISS LARGELY DUE TO THE BLOCKAGE OF THE ZESN </p><p>DOMESTIC OBSERVERS.  THE GOZ MAY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>OBSCURING TO SOME DEGREE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE </p><p>LEAD-UP TO THE ELECTION, AND PROBABLY ON ELECTION DAY AS </p><p>WELL.  HOWEVER, IN THE PROCESS THEY HAVE ALSO OPENED </p><p>THEMSELVES TO POST-ELECTION ACCUSATIONS THAT NEITHER THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION ENVIRONMENT NOR ELECTION DAY ACTIVITIES ADD </p><p>UP TO A VOTE, AND AN ANNOUNCED RESULT, THAT CAN BE </p><p>JUDGED AS FREE AND FAIR.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE </p><p>MORE THAN SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ON HAND TO </p><p>OUTWEIGH ANY EFFORTS BY LESS RELIABLE OBSERVER MISSIONS </p><p>TO WHITEWASH THE OUTCOME.  IN OUR VIEW, THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF HAVE CREATED A LOSE/LOSE SCENARIO FOR THEMSELVES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00620  05 OF 05  081224Z </p><p>IN THE COURT OF WORLD OPINION . </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
