<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001941 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR: DS/DSS, DS/OP/AF, DS/DSS/ATA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH NIGERIAN POLICE OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS </p><p>TRAINING REQUIREMENTS </p><p> </p><p> 1.   (U) On Friday, July 20, the Abuja RSO met with several </p><p>senior level Nigeria Police Force (NPF) officials.  The </p><p>purpose of this meeting was to obtain information requested </p><p>by the Department in preparation for providing the NPF </p><p>training under the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program. </p><p>The following information is in response to information </p><p>requested by DS/DSS/ATA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) A. LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A) What police organizations exist and operate in Nigeria? </p><p>Please provide the organizational structure(s), missions </p><p>and chains of command, and, if possible, an organizational </p><p>chart(s) (National/local Civil Police, Military police or </p><p>units, if applicable other law enforcement entities). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria is a Federal Republic.  The Nigeria Police Force is </p><p>a centralized police force, serving the entire country. </p><p>There are 36 states in Nigeria (plus the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory); each state has its own police command, but all </p><p>police commands report to the Inspector General of Police </p><p>(IGP), who is the senior police official in Nigeria.  The </p><p>IGP is based in Abuja.  A Commissioner of Police leads each </p><p>of the state police commands.  The state police commands </p><p>are aggregated into 7 zones.  An Assistant Inspector </p><p>General of Police is responsible for supervising all police </p><p>commands in his/her zone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF is a civilian law enforcement agency.  The Nigerian </p><p>military has decreasing responsibilities for law </p><p>enforcement and security in the civilian sector. The NPF </p><p>includes the following agencies: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-The Nigeria Police Force (NPF): The primary agency </p><p>responsible for law enforcement in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-The Federal Highway Patrol (FHP): Responsible for </p><p>patrolling inter-state highways and some VIP/dignitary </p><p>security (escort of motorcades). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC): Responsible for </p><p>enforcement of motor vehicle safety regulations, vehicle </p><p>inspections and taxation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-Police Mobile Force (PMF): Responsible for responding to </p><p>incidents requiring crowd/riot control and the protection </p><p>of Nigerian government facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-There are several specialized units within the NPF, to </p><p>include the Bomb Squad, Diplomatic Protection Unit </p><p>(responsible for providing security to foreign missions), </p><p>Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB) and Criminal </p><p>Investigations Division (CID). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) HOW DO THE VARIOUS POLICE FORCES AND MILITARY </p><p>COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF is responsible to enforce the law in the civilian </p><p>sector, to include traditional law enforcement in cities, </p><p>towns and rural areas.  The NPF also has special units </p><p>dedicated to protecting GON civilian facilities, to include </p><p>the Presidential Villa, federal offices, airports and </p><p>seaports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF works with the Nigerian military to patrol land </p><p>borders and provide oil pipeline security. Military law </p><p>enforcement organizations are primarily responsible for </p><p>policing on military bases, and ensuring the security of </p><p>military officials and facilities.  Joint patrols are </p><p>occasionally established to confront special threats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Senior level police officials, to include the IGP, are </p><p>selected from NPF career officers.  Most senior level NPF </p><p>officials have completed advanced degrees, to include law </p><p>school. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.    (U) CRISIS MANAGEMENT: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The IGP is in charge of all NPF operational efforts in </p><p>response to crises with national impact.  The NPF will </p><p>typically deploy large numbers of officers assigned to the </p><p>Police Mobile Force (PMF) to respond to a crisis.  The NPF </p><p>officials on the panel advised they have experienced the </p><p>following problems in responding to a crisis situation: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-Logistics (transportation); </p><p>-Inadequate equipment; </p><p>-Communications; </p><p>-Training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) INVESTIGATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB) is responsible </p><p>for gathering intelligence used by the police.  The NPF </p><p>Criminal Investigative Division (CID) is responsible for </p><p>conducting all criminal investigations.  CIB and CID are </p><p>led by Assistant Inspector Generals of Police (AIGP), who </p><p>report directly to the IGP.  Each of Nigeria\'s 36 states </p><p>and the FCT has its own separate CIB and CID commands, </p><p>which report directly to the Commissioner of Police for the </p><p>State.  Overall supervision is provided by the NPF CIB and </p><p>CID located at NPF Head Quarters in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF relays on the use of both evidence and </p><p>interrogation in the prosecution of cases.  NPF regulations </p><p>prohibit the use of force during interrogations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The CIB is the NPF entity responsible for detecting and </p><p>identifying any potential terrorist groups or activities. </p><p>This responsibility is also shared by two other GON </p><p>agencies that are not part of the NPF, the State Security </p><p>Service (SSS) and Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA).  The </p><p>NPF CID is responsible for investigating and prosecuting </p><p>any terrorist acts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) TERRORIST CASE MANAGEMENT: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF was involved in responding to an aircraft-hijacking </p><p>incident in the Republic of Niger in 1995.  The NPF sent </p><p>several officers to Niger to assist local authorities in </p><p>response to the incident, and conducted the investigation </p><p>after the incident was resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel advised their agency does </p><p>not possess adequate forensic capabilities, equipment and </p><p>training required to conduct an investigation of a major </p><p>terrorist incident.  The NPF officials expressed a strong </p><p>interest to receive assistance in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) EXPLOSIVE INCIDENTS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF has several late model Mercedes Benz bomb squad </p><p>trucks equipped with bomb handling robots and bomb </p><p>containment trailers.  However, the NPF officials on the </p><p>panel advised they are in dire need of bomb suits, </p><p>explosive detectors and portable x-ray devices.  The NPF </p><p>bomb squad also lacks trained bomb dogs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF bomb squad has received previous bomb handling </p><p>training from the Federal Republic of Germany, and post- </p><p>blast investigation from the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF bomb squad does not have significant experience </p><p>responding to actual bomb threats requiring them to "render </p><p>safe."  However, the NPF bomb squad has responded to </p><p>numerous industrial accidents involving explosive </p><p>chemicals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian military does not typically provide the NPF </p><p>with assistance in response to explosive incidents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.    (U)   POST BLAST INVESTIGATION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Post Blast Investigations (PBI) unit is a part of the </p><p>Nigeria Police Bomb Squad and CID units.  Bomb Squad units </p><p>are strategically located throughout Nigeria, to include </p><p>Lagos and Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF Bomb Squad PBI unit has not conducted any </p><p>significant investigations in the past 36 months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U) URBAN PATROL AND POLICING: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sizes of NPF police jurisdictions varies.  There are 37 </p><p>NPF state police commands.  A Commissioner of Police </p><p>supervises each police command.  Each command has several </p><p>different zones (supervised by a Deputy Commissioner of </p><p>Police), usually defined by the geographic boundaries of </p><p>cities or local area governments. Each zone has several </p><p>areas, further broken into districts.  Districts are </p><p>supervised by District Police Officers (DPO).  The officers </p><p>serving in a district are assigned to a post or beat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian Police lacks adequate resources (vehicles, </p><p>communications, etc.) to effectively respond to an </p><p>overwhelming crime situation.  Many local area, city and </p><p>state governments seek to reduce these inadequacies by </p><p>providing the NPF with additional patrol cars, boats, etc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF has not received any outside training in hostage </p><p>negotiation, roadblocks and response to high threat crimes </p><p>in progress.  The NPF officials on the panel expressed a </p><p>strong interest to receive additional training in these </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.   (U) LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS: </p><p>All NPF recruits are required to have completed secondary </p><p>school (the equivalent of U.S. High School) before </p><p>acceptance into the service.  The recruitment process </p><p>included a written examination and medical examination </p><p>before initial training.  The NPF does not conduct any </p><p>physical fitness examination on potential recruits. All NPF </p><p>recruits must be able to speak and read English. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The major NPF training academies are located in Ikeja </p><p>(Lagos), Jos, Kano, Kaduna and Enugu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF does not receive regular training from foreign law </p><p>enforcement agencies.  The NPF has received training in the </p><p>past, to include bomb handling training from the Federal </p><p>Republic of Germany and post blast investigation from the </p><p>United States.  Several senior level NPF officers have </p><p>attended training in the United States hosted by the FBI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel admitted there are serious </p><p>inadequacies in their training program, especially in the </p><p>area of firearms training.  Most recruits are lucky if they </p><p>have the opportunity to fire more than a dozen rounds while </p><p>in training.  There is no requirement to pass with a </p><p>minimum score, and targets are hardly every evaluated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   (U) CRISIS REACTION TEAMS (SWAT): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF does not have a dedicated Crisis Reaction Team.  In </p><p>the event of a crisis situation, the NPF draws officers </p><p>from regular police units.  These NPF officers do not </p><p>receive any special Crises Reaction training or equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel expressed a strong interest </p><p>in receiving assistance in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.   (U) CONTROL OF INTERNATIONAL BORDERS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria\'s borders are protected by joint patrols of the NPF </p><p>and Nigerian Military.  The NPF has dedicated units </p><p>assigned to protecting seaports and airports.  Special NPF </p><p>marine units patrol waterways, and enforce maritime law in </p><p>cooperation with the Nigerian Navy and Coast Guard.  Like </p><p>most other NPF units, these units are ill prepared, </p><p>equipped and trained to adequately perform their duties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.   (U) PERSONAL PROTECTION OPERATIONS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF has a large number of officers assigned to VIP and </p><p>dignitary protection.  Most of these officers are assigned </p><p>to CIB or PMF.  The NPF only protects persons inside </p><p>Nigeria.  NPF officers are assigned to current and former </p><p>high-level GON officials.  The NPF also provides security </p><p>for any foreign government official upon request.  The </p><p>protection services provided by the NPF includes crowd </p><p>control, motorcade escort and the manning of security </p><p>posts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF regularly provides security for high-level official </p><p>USG visits.  This support has been invaluable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officers on the panel expressed a strong interest </p><p>in learning proper motorcade procedures, site advance work </p><p>and close quarters protection operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.   (U) INSTALLATION SECURITY: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF Police Mobile Force is responsible for manning </p><p>security posts at GON facilities.  The NPF does not conduct </p><p>any threat/risk analysis of these facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel expressed a strong interest </p><p>in receiving training in these areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.   (U) ASSISTANCE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF has not received any significant hands on training </p><p>or assistance from other countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.   (U) WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (WMD): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF does not have the capability to respond to a WMD </p><p>scenario.  The NPF does not have an emergency plan, </p><p>equipment, logistics or training to respond to a WMD </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials expressed a strong interest in receiving </p><p>training and assistance in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.   (U) MEDICAL SERVICES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel characterized their medical </p><p>emergency disaster plan as inadequate.  Nigeria lacks </p><p>adequate medical facilities and response services. </p><p>The NPF officials on the panel expressed a strong interest </p><p>in receiving additional training and assistance in this </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.   (U) RSO COMMENTS: </p><p>The Abuja RSO has worked with the Nigerian Police Force and </p><p>other security agencies for the past two and a half years. </p><p>The level of support provided by the host country law </p><p>enforcement and security services has been phenomenal. </p><p>Although the NPF seriously lacks adequate resources to </p><p>effectively respond to an overwhelming responsibility, they </p><p>consistently provide the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Nigeria </p><p>everything they have to ensure the security of Mission </p><p>personnel, facilities and high-level USG visits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After two decades of neglect under military rule, Nigeria\'s </p><p>civilian law enforcement and security services are in dire </p><p>need of training assistance in all areas. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
