<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSMAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 471 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  The Ambassador met with Human Rights Ombudsman </p><p>Sergio Morales on February 27 to support the Ombudsman\'s </p><p>proposal for the commission to investigate clandestine groups </p><p>(CICIACS).  Morales was encouraged by President Portillo\'s </p><p>recent official response and believes Vivanco\'s recent </p><p>memorandum was also positive.  The press gave the meeting </p><p>ample, positive coverage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Ambassador, Acting PolCouns, and HROff visited Human </p><p>Rights Ombudsman (PDH) Sergio Morales in his offices on </p><p>Thursday, February 27.  The Ombudsman thanked the Ambassador </p><p>for his overwhelming support of the human rights community </p><p>and the proposal for the CICIACS.  Morales said while the </p><p>Embassy has been a strong PDH ally, the Ambassador\'s public </p><p>support exceeded his expectations.  The Ambassador said </p><p>support for Morales\' work is fundamental to US policy and </p><p>that he can count on our continued support. </p><p> </p><p>CICIACS update </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Ambassador told Morales he discussed the CICIACS with </p><p>President Portillo recently and had asked Portillo to respond </p><p>formally to Morales.  Portillo subsequently sent Morales a </p><p>letter on February 27 explaining GOG support for the ideas </p><p>behind the CICIACS proposal and expressing the GOG\'s desire </p><p>to negotiate the proposal through Jose Miguel Vivanco. </p><p>Morales appreciated Portillo\'s formal response, which was the </p><p>first word he had received from the GOG since his public </p><p>release of the proposal on January 16.  Morales confessed </p><p>that he was "still analyzing" Portillo\'s prose but viewed it </p><p>as generally positive. </p><p> </p><p>4.  According to Morales, a letter from FM Gutierrez on </p><p>Vivanco\'s departure had raised Morales\'s concerns about </p><p>over-broadening the commission\'s mandate to include crimes </p><p>linked to private security forces.  This new Portillo letter, </p><p>however, returned to the CICIACS\'s original, narrower scope </p><p>on crimes linked to state agents.  The Ambassador and Morales </p><p>agreed that Vivanco\'s memorandum and Reed Brody\'s inclusion </p><p>in upcoming negotiations were other positive developments. </p><p>Morales said he is eager for Vivanco and Brody to come in </p><p>March to push the GOG and the human rights community toward a </p><p>consensus. </p><p> </p><p>Resource Request </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Morales said he appreciates the Embassy\'s moral support, </p><p>but that the PDH also needs resources in order to continue </p><p>expanding its work.  The Ambassador pledged to strengthen the </p><p>PDH through USAID assistance, especially since it will be </p><p>assuming many of MINUGUA\'s functions in the coming years. </p><p>Morales thanked the Ambassador and said the USG "brings good </p><p>luck" to his institution. </p><p> </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Ambassador asked if Morales had been receiving </p><p>threats and Morales responded that he had not, but many of </p><p>his auxiliary Ombudsmen had, including those in </p><p>Huehuetenango, Solola, Zacapa, and Quiche.  The Ambassador </p><p>and Morales talked about ways to improve the "culture of </p><p>lawfulness," as they agree that many human rights problems </p><p>have cultural roots.  Morales said threats reported by the </p><p>human rights community have dropped off since public </p><p>discussion of the CICIACS began in mid-January.  The </p><p>Ambassador said we will remain engaged on human rights </p><p>workers\' security and asked Morales to let him know if the </p><p>situation worsens. </p><p> </p><p>Press Coverage </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Ambassador\'s brief session with the press following </p><p>the meeting was widely documented and produced the following </p><p>quotes in leading daily Prensa Libre: </p><p> </p><p>-CICIACS: It is an encouraging sign that the President </p><p>responded to the Ombudsman and demonstrated his willingness </p><p>to form a commission. </p><p> </p><p>-(Upon his return in March) We hope that (Vivanco) can obtain </p><p>agreements quickly.  It is because of this dialogue that we </p><p>have reason to be cautiously positive. </p><p> </p><p>-Decertification: We have seen improvement, but there is </p><p>still much work to be done.  What we see as important is that </p><p>all the institutions involved are ready to cooperate.  It is </p><p>probable that the government will form a commission devoted </p><p>to this topic.  It is difficult to talk about advance steps </p><p>at this time; we will probably review the counternarcotics </p><p>efforts in September. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Morales was more optimistic than we expected about the </p><p>GOG response and Vivanco\'s mission.  He will be an important </p><p>ally in our efforts to moderate NGO skepticism so as to </p><p>prevent the "perfect from becoming enemy to the good" on </p><p>CICIACS.  End Comment. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
