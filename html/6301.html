<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000651 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: MACK CASE MISSTEP INCREASES SUSPICION </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 623 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The case against the GOG on behalf of the </p><p>family of murdered anthropologist Myrna Mack was presented </p><p>February 18-20 in the Inter-American Court in San Jose, Costa </p><p>Rica.  In the days leading up to the trial, FM Gutierrez </p><p>attempted to short-circuit this hearing by publicly accepting </p><p>state responsibility for Mack\'s death and withdrawing GOG </p><p>representative Ricardo Alvarado Ortigoza from the trial.  The </p><p>court would have none of this.  GOG lawyers returned for the </p><p>closing arguments and Gutierrez, a co-founder of the Myrna </p><p>Mack Foundation, took responsibility for the misstep.  Mack\'s </p><p>sister, human rights activist Helen Mack, pushed the case </p><p>forward despite Gutierrez\'s antics.  In the wake of the </p><p>public audience, both sides await the IACHR\'s decision, </p><p>expected in about three months. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Before Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez was </p><p>appointed by President Portillo as head of the GOG </p><p>Secretariat for Strategic Analysis, he was one of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>co-founders, along with Helen Mack, of the Myrna Mack </p><p>Foundation (FMM).  The Mack Foundation was established in </p><p>1993 in memory of Myrna Mack, a slain anthropologist who was </p><p>a close friend (and by some accounts an intimate) of </p><p>Gutierrez\'s.  Gutierrez worked at the Mack Foundation until </p><p>1998, when he left to work at the Archbishop\'s Office of </p><p>Human Right\'s Historical Memory Project (RHEMI).  In 2000, </p><p>Portillo offered Gutierrez the senior GOG advisory position </p><p>because of the close personal relationship they developed at </p><p>the University of San Carlos in the 1970s.  As a colleague of </p><p>Gutierrez\'s put it, "Gutierrez thought this was an </p><p>opportunity to do some good within the government," after a </p><p>career of working on civilian security issues from an NGO </p><p>perspective. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Human rights leaders tell us that while many were </p><p>suspicious of Gutierrez after he joined the GOG in 2000, </p><p>Helen Mack was initially his constant defender.  That </p><p>relationship soured in recent years, as trust turned to </p><p>suspicion.  Human Rights Ombudsman Sergio Morales still </p><p>professes confidence in Gutierrez, but many other human </p><p>rights leaders now see the divide between Gutierrez and his </p><p>former colleagues in the human rights movement as </p><p>insurmountable.  The misstep in San Jose made the breach </p><p>final, according to our human rights contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Confused Correspondence </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On February 17, the day before the trial at the IACHR </p><p>in Costa Rica was set to begin, Gutierrez announced that the </p><p>Government of Guatemala admitted responsibility for the </p><p>murder of Myrna Mack Chang in September 1990.  Gutierrez had </p><p>sent a letter on February 14 to the IACHR accepting state </p><p>responsibility.  The GOG did not, however, address the other </p><p>charges (including delayed justice and the involvement of the </p><p>Presidential Guard (EMP) in the murder).  The IACHR and the </p><p>Mack family, which appeared as the plaintiff in the case, </p><p>considered the admission of state responsibility in the </p><p>murder insufficient, and pushed forward with the trial on </p><p>February 18.  On February 19, the GOG removed its </p><p>representatives, including Ricardo Alvarado Ortigoza, since </p><p>appointed as Ambassador to Geneva (reftel), from the </p><p>proceedings. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) With the GOG representatives absent, the Mack team </p><p>presented their evidence against the state and concluded the </p><p>proceedings on February 20.  The GOG team returned for the </p><p>final arguments, after the presentation of evidence phase </p><p>concluded.  Both sides are waiting for the IACHR to present </p><p>its conclusion, which Helen Mack told us could take up to </p><p>three months.  What is unknown at this point is whether the </p><p>GOG\'s partial withdrawal from the proceedings will influence </p><p>the court\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Gutierrez has argued that his ministry\'s actions were </p><p>well-intentioned but misunderstood.  Gutierrez has responded </p><p>to criticism by stating that the GOG\'s intent was not to </p><p>limit state\'s responsibility for the murder, but instead to </p><p>clarify state involvement in Mack\'s murder.  Gutierrez </p><p>claimed that the GOG, under President Portillo, supports full </p><p>investigation of human rights crimes of the internal </p><p>conflict.  Gutierrez publicly lamented the fact that his </p><p>first letter to the IACHR caused skepticism about the GOG\'s </p><p>motives and denied he was "covering up" for the EMP or other </p><p>GOG entities charged with human rights abuses, as his critics </p><p>claim. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) This debacle at the IACHR further undermines </p><p>Gutierrez\'s credibility with former friends in the human </p><p>rights community and will make achieving consensus on a </p><p>CICIACS all the more difficult.  Time will tell if Gutierrez </p><p>can make it up to civil society, but we see reconciliation as </p><p>highly unlikely before Portillo and Gutierrez leave office. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
