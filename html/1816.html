<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 003756 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (DEAN, SPILSBURY) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 120/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PHUM, MZ, PHUM, MZ, VT, VTEAID, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT:  EMBASSY VATICAN TEXT FOR NICHOLSON CONFIRMATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) GFROWICK/SDEAN TELCON 7/12 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PER REFTELCON, EMBASSY VATICAN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING TEXT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03756  01 OF 02  131452Z </p><p>FOR POSSIBLE USE BY NOMINEE NICHOLSON\'S OPENING STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>IN 1984 THE UNITED STATES JOINED 107 OTHER COUNTRIES, </p><p>INCLUDING ALL OF OUR WESTERN ALLIES, WHEN WE ESTABLISHED </p><p>NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>IS AN ENTITY THAT, UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, HAS AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL "PERSONALITY" WHICH GIVES THE JURIDICAL </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF A STATE AND THAT HAS ITS TERRITORIAL </p><p>MANIFESTATION IN THE VATICAN CITY STATE.  IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>THE DAY, THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP MADE A LOT OF SENSE: IT </p><p>HELPED US MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH HOLY SEE AGAINST COMMUNISM </p><p>AND THREATS TO WORLD SECURITY IN WANING DAYS OF COLD WAR. </p><p> </p><p>AT THAT TIME THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT ESTABLISHING THIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WOULD INFRINGE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION </p><p>OF CHURCH AND STATE.  I THINK THAT THE WORK OF OUR EMBASSY </p><p>DURING THE INTERVENING YEARS HAS BORNE OUT THE WISDOM OF </p><p>ESTABLISHING THIS RELATIONSHIP.  THAT WORK HAS FOCUSED ON </p><p>THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>DURING THOSE YEARS THE VERY SMALL STAFF OF OUR EMBASSY TO </p><p>THE HOLY SEE HAS PROVIDED INVALUABLE REPORTING ON VATICAN </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS AROUND </p><p>THE WORLD.  IT HAS HELPED TO SUSTAIN A COMMON FRONT AGAINST </p><p>AGGRESSION IN PLACES AS DIVERSE AS KOSOVO AND IRAQ, AND IT </p><p>HAS WORKED WITH VATICAN COUNTERPARTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IN </p><p>AFRICA -- MOST NOTABLY IN MOZAMBIQUE. </p><p> </p><p>(NOTE: EMBASSY STAFF CONSISTS OF THREE FOREIGN SERVICE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03756  01 OF 02  131452Z </p><p>OFFICERS AND ABOUT A DOZEN LOCALLY HIRED STAFF). </p><p> </p><p>THE TIMES ARE CHANGING.  IN THIS NEW MILLENIUM MANY THREATS </p><p>TO OUR SECURITY AND PROSPERITY ARE GLOBAL IN NATURE -- AND </p><p>HOLY SEE CAN BE A USEFUL PARTNER ON MANY ISSUES AND IN MANY </p><p>AREAS OF THE WORLD: </p><p> </p><p>EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE ARE COLLABORATING OR CAN COLLABORATE </p><p>FRUITFULLY WITH THE HOLY SEE: </p><p> </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ISSUES: </p><p> </p><p>-- FIGHTING AIDS, ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA; PROMOTING </p><p>RESPONSIBLE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE; DEBT </p><p>RELIEF. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES: </p><p> </p><p>--  ENDING REGIONAL CONFLICTS (CONGO, BURUNDI, SUDAN, </p><p>NAGORNO-KARABAKH), </p><p> </p><p>--  INTER-COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION (OUR EMBASSY HAS DEVELOPED </p><p>PROJECTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VATICAN AFFILIATED LAY </p><p>COMMUNITY OF SANT\'EGIDIO IN THE BALKANS, AND IN MOZAMBIQUE), </p><p> </p><p>--  EUROPEAN SECURITY (THE POPE\'S OUTREACH TO ORTHODOX FITS </p><p>WITH OUR OWN INTEREST IN PROMOTING "A EUROPE WHOLE AND </p><p>FREE"). </p><p> </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES: </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03756  01 OF 02  131452Z </p><p>-- HOLY SEE IS A VALUABLE PARTNER IN PROMOTING DEMOCRACY </p><p>ABROAD (CUBA, CHINA, MIDDLE EAST, ETC.) </p><p> </p><p>--  VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM; OUR EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE PLAYS UNIQUE </p><p>ROLE IN SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT </p><p>OF 1998 BY SHARING INFORMATION ON PROBLEM AREAS LITERALLY </p><p>AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD, WHERE THE HOLY SEE, UNIQUELY AMONG </p><p>SMALL "COUNTRIES" HAS IMPORTANT PRESENCE THROUGH THE ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH AND ITS MISSIONARY AND SPECIALIZED COUNCILS. </p><p> </p><p>TO ELABORATE, </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN IS KEEPING CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE HOLY SEE </p><p>IN REGARD TO QUESTIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE </p><p>VATICAN SHARES U.S. CONCERNS ON THE NEED TO PROMOTE </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE VATICAN DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>OFFICIAL TIES WITH CHINA.  IT DOES HOWEVER MAINTAIN FORMAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIWAN.  THIS IS A UNIQUE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>SITUATION ON THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT. </p><p> </p><p>WE FOLLOW WITH INTEREST THE EFFORTS OF THE VATICAN AND </p><p>CARITAS, THE VATICAN\'S ARM FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, TO </p><p>ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING OF THE POPULATION OF NORTH KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5675 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03756  02 OF 02  131452Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    UTED-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PRS-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------0542EB  131456Z /38 </p><p>O 131533Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003756 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.
