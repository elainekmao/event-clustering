<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUANGZHOU 08077 </p><p> </p><p>BEIJING PLEASE PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: HU JINTAO--A GLANCE AT HIS CHARACTER </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. DURING A RECENT CALL ON THE CONSUL GENERAL, </p><p>U.S. POLITICAL SCIENTIST PARRIS CHANG RECOUNTED </p><p>A CONVERSATION HE HAD RECENTLY HAD ABOUT HU </p><p>JINTAO.  IN TRAVELLING BACK FROM HAINAN TO </p><p>GUANGZHOU HE WAS SEATED NEXT TO AN </p><p>ENTREPRENEUR FROM GUIZHOU.  CHANG ASKED WHAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT OF HU JINTAO, WHO HAD BEEN THE </p><p>PARTY SECRETARY IN GUIZHOU BEFORE BEING NAMED </p><p>TO TIBET.  THE ENTREPRENEUR SAID THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT HU HAD TWO SIGNIFICANT FAILINGS </p><p>WHICH MADE IT DOUBTFUL HE COULD SUCCEED IN </p><p>TIBET.  FIRST, HU HAD NO CLOSE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE MILITARY.  SECOND, HE WAS A CAUTIOUS, </p><p>VACILLATING LEADER.  AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HU\'S </p><p>TIMIDITY, THE ENTREPRENEUR SAID THAT DURING ONE </p><p>OF HIS TRIPS HE HAD WORKED OUT A PROJECT WHICH </p><p>WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE EXPANSION OF GUIZHOU\'S </p><p>EXPORTS.  HE SENT A COPY OF HIS SUGGESTION TO </p><p>HU WHO SAID THAT IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA </p><p>AND HE SHOULD SUGGEST THAT THE APPROPRIATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENT IT.  WHEN THE </p><p>ENTREPRENEUR TRIED TO DO SO, THERE WAS THE USUAL </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC OPPOSITION FROM VARIOUS OFFICES, AND </p><p>IN THE END NOTHING WAS DONE.  HE COMMENTED THAT </p><p>HU WAS PREPARED TO MOVE ONLY IF EVERYONE AGREED </p><p>WITH SOMETHING; HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO TACKLE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  GIVEN THE SITUATION IN TIBET, </p><p>HU WILL BE FACING MANY DIFFERENCES AND WILL </p><p>GET LITTLE DONE IF HE IS NOT PREPARED TO EXERT </p><p>HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY HEARSAY </p><p>INFORMATION, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT CHANG ACCURATELY </p><p>RECOUNTED WHAT THE GUIZHOU ENTREPRENEUR TOLD HIM. </p><p>THE REMARKS SEEM SOMEWHAT OVERLY FRANK FOR SUCH </p><p>A PERSON TO MAKE TO AN UNKNOWN TAIWAN AMERICAN, </p><p>BUT THEY MAY REFLECT WHAT SOME CHINESE ARE </p><p>SAYING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HU. </p><p> </p><p>PRATT </p><p></p></div>
