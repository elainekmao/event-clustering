SUMMARY: Calls for boycotting and withdrawing from the </p><p>Arab League are raised following the organization\'s </p><p>communique condemning the war, with one commentator labeling </p><p>the League as a "house of ill-repute." Another notes </p><p>pointedly that Kuwait is the only Arab country to commit aid </p><p>to Iraqi refugees. Al-Jazeera news channel is attacked for </p><p>broadcasting images of American POWs: "Al-Jazeera has proven </p><p>that they are supporters of Iraq." A Kuwaiti Shiite scholar </p><p>calls for Shiites in Iraq to rebel against the regime. </p><p> </p><p>A writer urges the government to emphasize its humanitarian </p><p>aid plans for the Iraqi people, adding that these plans have </p><p>been deliberately minimized during months of public hedging </p><p>and equivocation by the Kuwait leadership on the question of </p><p>whether the country would support war with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Media reports state that schools and government offices-- </p><p>closed over the past week--will reopen on March 29, and that </p><p>some flights into Kuwait will be restored. Bread production </p><p>has decreased due to falling demand after initial reports of </p><p>shortages during the opening days of hostilities with Iraq. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: The front page of Al-Seyassa on March 24 </p><p>carries Acting Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed\'s </p><p>announcement that Kuwait will provide 45 thousand meals per </p><p>day to "our Iraqi brethren" as part of Kuwait\'s humanitarian </p><p>assistance to the Iraqi people.

Al-Qabas also reports that </p><p>the Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs, Mohammad Al- </p><p>Sharar states that government bodies will resume normal work </p><p>on March 29. </p><p> </p><p>The Minister of Interior Mohammad Al-Khaled tells the </p><p>Editors-in-Chief of local newspapers that only 15,800 </p><p>Kuwaitis have left Kuwait as opposed to 47,000 thousand </p><p>expatriates. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan and Al-Rai Al-Aam report that the Under Secretary </p><p>of the Ministry of Education denies rumors that teachers who </p><p>leave Kuwait will be fired, but said that those who do not </p><p>return when classes resume on March 29 will be breaking </p><p>their contracts. A Ministry of Interior official source </p><p>likewise denies reports that the Ministry will prevent the </p><p>return of expatriates that fled Kuwait due to the war. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassa reports on March 24 that Gulf Air has resumed its </p><p>flights to Kuwait, and that Kuwait Airways will soon revisit </p><p>its decision to suspend flights to Europe and the United </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Anba front pages news that the Kuwait Stock Exchange will </p><p>reopen on March 26. </p><p> </p><p>The Director of the Kuwait Bakeries Company announced that </p><p>bread production in Kuwait has decreased from 4.5 to less </p><p>than 2 million loaves of bread per day due to decreasing </p><p>demand, reports Al-Watan on March 25. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Our Contribution Must Be Effective" </p><p>Abdelatif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/24): </p><p>"We don\'t know why our government is concealing its role </p><p>while the world realizes that the campaign on Iraq was </p><p>deployed from Kuwait. If our government is insisting on </p><p>[this position], then we should stress our humanitarian role </p><p>in providing medical care and food supplies and in </p><p>supporting the reconstruction process in Iraq. We must have </p><p>a more effective role in the liberation of Iraq by involving </p><p>our charitable organizations and government in repaving the </p><p>road of relations between Iraq and Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Humanitarian Mission" </p><p>Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/25): </p><p>"Kuwait is the only Arab country which has formed a </p><p>committee to give aid to Iraqi refugees because [Kuwait] </p><p>believes strongly in Arab principles. Whoever cares for Iraq </p><p>and the Iraqi people must support the efforts to liberate </p><p>Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The War on Iraq is Not a Crusade" </p><p>Abdelmohsen Al-Husseni wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/25): </p><p>"The Imam of the Al-Azhar Islamic University [in Cairo] </p><p>stated to the BBC that we cannot describe the war on Iraq a </p><p>crusade war because. there are many Christians who object to </p><p>this war, including the Pope himself. There is no doubt that </p><p>his opinions are correct because it limits those who want to </p><p>involve Islam in issues that are not of Muslims\' concerns." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "House of Ill-Repute" </p><p>Abdelamir Al-Torki wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/25): </p><p>"The surreal Arab get-together held in Cairo yesterday </p><p>signaled the end of the old Arab regimes. [C]ountries such </p><p>as the GCC states, Egypt and Jordan support the </p><p>establishment of a new Middle East while on the other hand, </p><p>some countries have decided to side with Saddam to prevent </p><p>the establishment of a new world system. We are certain that </p><p>these countries will not last long after the fall of Saddam. </p><p>The enlightened Arab countries are the ones responsible for </p><p>the upcoming change. They can prove it by withdrawing from </p><p>the Arab League which has been tarnished." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Boycott the Arab League" </p><p>Dr. Naji Al-Ziad wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/25):  "We </p><p>are not obligated to attend Arab League meetings to discuss </p><p>the Iraqi crisis. if [these meetings] are to support the </p><p>Iraqi regime. We should not. accept their cursing and </p><p>accusations that we are traitors." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Al-Jazeera and the Unethical Broadcast" </p><p>Abdelrahman Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/25): </p><p>"By broadcasting the pictures of the American POWs on </p><p>television, Al-Jazeera has proven that they are supporters </p><p>of Iraq. [B]roadcasting pictures for POWs and dead soldiers </p><p>will not be in the interest of Al-Jazeera, especially </p><p>because Iraq is not treating the POWs according to the </p><p>Geneva Convention." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "To President Bush" </p><p>Mohamamd Al-Saddiqi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(3/25): "We congratulate you for making this historic </p><p>decision and for sacrificing your sons in the American army </p><p>to save the Iraqi people from a tyrannical regime and </p><p>restore freedom in Iraq. Mr. President, your father made a </p><p>historic decision to liberate Kuwait and now you have made </p><p>the decision to liberate Iraq. May God bless you both." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
