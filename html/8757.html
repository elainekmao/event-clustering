Dr. Ahmad </p><p>     said that his office is responsible for CODEX issues </p><p>     but is unlikely to attend the CODEX Alimentarius </p><p>     Commission (CAC) session in Rome. The UAE delegation </p><p>     will likely be led by Halid Sharif, Food Control </p><p>     Division Director for Dubai Municipality. </p><p> </p><p>     2.  (SBU) The UAE has not yet decided who it will </p><p>     support for CODEX Chairperson. If Sharif goes to the </p><p>     CAC meeting, Dr. Ahmad will consult with him about our </p><p>     request to support the candidacy of Mr. Gonzalo Rios </p><p>     Kantorowitz.  However, according to Dr. Ahmad, the GCC </p><p>     countries usually confer with each other on CODEX </p><p>     matters and probably will back the same candidate. He </p><p>     believes members of the GCC Food Control Committee </p><p>     will attempt to interview the candidates and will make </p><p>     a decision on whom to support just before the CAC </p><p>     session. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
