<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HO CHI MINH CITY 000337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PHUM, PREL, ETRD, EINV, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: CHURCH AND STATE MAINTAIN BALANCE IN TAY NINH PROVINCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  02 HANOI 199,   B)  02 HANOI 208 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (U)  On a recent one-day trip to meet with provincial and Cao </p><p>Dai Church leaders in Tay Ninh Province, the Ambassador came away </p><p>with a mostly positive impression of the current state of health </p><p>of both the province and the religion which predominates there. </p><p>Tay Ninh, while still on the fringes of the relative prosperity </p><p>enjoyed by HCMC and some of its other surrounding provinces, has a </p><p>leadership clearly committed to economic growth and development. </p><p>And as the largest single "constituency" within the province, the </p><p>Cao Dai appear to be benefiting from that commitment -- despite a </p><p>continued inability to fill their own senior ranks.  Our </p><p>impression was that the Cao Dai faithful are freely practicing </p><p>their syncretic religion, with even some expansion in their </p><p>numbers, but as is the case with all religions in Vietnam, the </p><p>state and party maintain tight control over the religion\'s </p><p>organization and personnel.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Cao Dai Worship Little Changed in 30 Years </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>2.  (U)  The Ambassador recently returned to Tay Ninh Province, on </p><p>the western border of HCMC, for the first time since his 1970-1973 </p><p>tour of duty as a junior officer in Vietnam.  During that </p><p>assignment, he was responsible for covering the Cao Dai -- </p><p>Vietnam\'s homegrown syncretic religion -- out of Embassy Saigon\'s </p><p>political section.  Upon entering the Cao Dai Holy See for the </p><p>noon service, he remarked that very little seemed to have changed </p><p>in either the physical or spiritual setting.  Men and woman seated </p><p>in neat rows on opposite sides of the long rectangular floor of </p><p>the hall bowed their heads in prayer to a steady beat of gongs and </p><p>chanting as incense filled the air. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Immediately noticeable, however, were the empty chairs </p><p>closest to the altar reserved for the top church hierarchy -- the </p><p>Pope and Cardinals.  Empty too were the spots on the floor where </p><p>the archbishops would normally kneel in prayer.  (The floor of the </p><p>temple rises progressively through nine levels as it approaches </p><p>the sacred altar.  Clergy sit in prayer on the level corresponding </p><p>to their rank.)  Otherwise, the service appeared to be well </p><p>attended.  While a fair number of young people were spotted among </p><p>the worshippers, most of the clergy were well into their 60s.  The </p><p>stunningly decorated temple, painted every year, looked very well </p><p>maintained. </p><p> </p><p>Lonely at the Top, but Not Really Alone </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU)  After the service, the Ambassador took a guided tour of </p><p>the temple with the head of the Cao Dai Management Council, </p><p>Archbishop Thuong Tam Thanh.  While Thanh had been reluctant to </p><p>meet with ConGenoffs last year without prior approval from the </p><p>provincial People\'s Committee (ref A), he seemed happy to meet </p><p>with the Ambassador on this officially sanctioned trip.  The </p><p>Archbishop was animated and upbeat, although he became rather </p><p>wistful when describing the significance of the vacant chairs and </p><p>unoccupied spaces on the floor.  He noted that he was one of only </p><p>a handful of clergy at his rank who was still alive.  There were </p><p>supposed to be 33 archbishops at any given time, in keeping with a </p><p>religious doctrine heavily influenced by numerology. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Continuing the discussion in his nearby office suite, </p><p>the Archbishop adopted the disconcerting habit of writing down </p><p>everything the Ambassador said, despite the presence of others in </p><p>the large, open-air meeting room serving as note takers.  At least </p><p>a few individuals in the room gave both Ambassador and Poloff the </p><p>impression that they represented the interests of the GVN more </p><p>than those of the Cao Dai.  The more restrained and formulaic </p><p>nature of the Archbishop\'s answers in the office tended to </p><p>buttress that conclusion.  Still, he did openly thank the </p><p>Ambassador for the invitation to last year\'s Consulate General </p><p>July 4th celebration. </p><p> </p><p>Church Flourishes While Leadership Withers </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Early in the conversation, the Archbishop gestured off </p><p>in the distance at the many structures that had been built during </p><p>the intervening years since the Ambassador\'s first tour.  "All of </p><p>this did not happen in one or two years," he said.  He claimed a </p><p>current total of 5 million Cao Dai adherents in Vietnam -- </p><p>significantly higher than the GVN figure of 1-2 million, or even </p><p>NGO estimates of 2-3 million -- with the numbers constantly on the </p><p>rise.  Four hundred thousand Cao Dai make Tay Ninh home, but many </p><p>others come to worship regularly, including hundreds of thousands </p><p>who returned on January 9 and August 15 of each lunar year for the </p><p>two main Cao Dai festivals. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The Archbishop was less optimistic about the prospects </p><p>for filling the senior ranks of the clergy  because of the </p><p>unfortunate confluence of old age and limited opportunities for </p><p>promotion.  As one of the conditions for GVN recognition in 1997, </p><p>exclusive power to make promotion decisions was vested in the </p><p>newly created Management Council.  The Management Council meets </p><p>only once every five years.  While seances had sometimes been used </p><p>in the past to determine promotions -- a practice outlawed by the </p><p>GVN as "superstitious" -- selection by high-ranking clergy had </p><p>always existed as an alternative.  Promotion decisions at present </p><p>are based solely on experience and seniority; no one is allowed to </p><p>skip a rank.  Given the advanced age of most of the higher-ranking </p><p>clergy and the fact that they can only be promoted one rank every </p><p>five years, this protracted rate of advancement virtually </p><p>guarantees that the highest positions will probably remain vacant </p><p>for some time to come. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  According to the Archbishop, amalgamating the three </p><p>bodies of Cao Dai clergy -- red, blue, and yellow (legislative, </p><p>executive, and charitable works) -- into a single Management </p><p>Council was a by-product of the same limitations.  Traditionally, </p><p>each of the three branches was supposed to have 12 archbishops and </p><p>one cardinal.  However, with only two congresses since 1975 and no </p><p>way to skip ranks, it was clear that there just would not be </p><p>sufficient numbers of senior clergy to meet this requirement.  In </p><p>their absence, the Management Council had been created to provide </p><p>the necessary structure for managing the activities of the church. </p><p>The 72 members, all high-ranking clergy, were elected every five </p><p>years at the same congresses which decided promotions.  (Over 3000 </p><p>Cao Dai leaders and government officials from 34 provinces and </p><p>HCMC attended the October 2002 "Human Life Congress," promoting </p><p>924 clergy, including the Archbishop.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The Archbishop did not attempt to justify the new </p><p>system or compare it to the old model.  Mostly, he just seemed </p><p>resigned to it.  While he recognized that some Cao Dai, including </p><p>a number in the U.S., did not appreciate the need for a Management </p><p>Council or were unhappy over their exclusion, he noted that all </p><p>religion requires discipline and law.  (The Archbishop later asked </p><p>about the possibility of applying for a visa to meet with Cao Dai </p><p>officials in the U.S. in the future.)  The Archbishop also </p><p>acknowledged that while the structure was meant to unify all 13 </p><p>branches of the Cao Dai, some of the smaller sects had always </p><p>remained separate from the main Tay Ninh branch.  Groups which </p><p>existed outside the Council were not official in GVN eyes, but </p><p>generally continued to pursue their activities without </p><p>interference.  He resisted criticizing retired pre-1975 Cao Dai </p><p>leaders Archbishop Thai The Thanh and Archbishop Thuong Nha Thanh </p><p>(ref B), but clearly disagreed with their decisions to "abandon </p><p>service" to the Cao Dai faithful. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Minimizing the intrusiveness of government regulation, </p><p>the Archbishop dismissed concerns of GVN control over ordination </p><p>of new clergy -- a common complaint of other religions in Vietnam. </p><p>After all, the Cao Dai themselves, not the GVN, required </p><p>verification of "good citizenship" from the relevant local </p><p>authorities before candidates were considered for the priesthood. </p><p>He was unable to explain why the Cao Dai had not expressed more </p><p>interest in political activities, especially in the province where </p><p>they were most numerous.  While he himself had once been a </p><p>National Assembly member, the Archbishop could think of no other </p><p>Cao Dai active in national or local politics. </p><p> </p><p>Confiscation by Another Name </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Downplaying another common grievance of other </p><p>religions in Vietnam -- post-war confiscations of property -- the </p><p>Archbishop tried to rationalize the "borrowing of unused" Cao Dai </p><p>properties by the Fatherland Front in 1975.  He said whenever the </p><p>Cao Dai needed a property back, they merely had to provide a </p><p>justification and it was returned.  There are currently 600 Cao </p><p>Dai temples nationwide, by his count.  His resolve wavered just a </p><p>bit when the Ambassador reminisced about the highly regarded </p><p>educational institutions once operated by the Cao Dai, including </p><p>the former university which had been converted to a cadre training </p><p>school.  However, the Archbishop quickly pointed out that unlike </p><p>the Protestant and Catholic religions, the Cao Dai church had </p><p>never relied on seminaries to train its clergy.  Those who showed </p><p>promising academic qualifications and wished to devote their lives </p><p>to the Cao Dai faith were brought to the temple for bible study. </p><p>Success was then based on their actual work record, rather than </p><p>any sort of book learning.  Education was never a determining </p><p>factor in promotions. </p><p> </p><p>People\'s Committee Upbeat on Economic Fundamentals </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>12.  (SBU) In a separate meeting (in the same compound used by the </p><p>provincial government before 1975), People\'s Committee Chairman </p><p>Nguyen Tan Lam urged the Ambassador to encourage American business </p><p>investment in Tay Ninh, a province of approximately one million. </p><p>While the province had yet to feel much impact from the BTA, he </p><p>boasted of an 11.7 percent overall increase in GDP, with 10 </p><p>percent across the board growth in industrial production, </p><p>agriculture, and services.  Industrial output accounted for 34 </p><p>percent of GDP, but tourism was also a major source of revenue. </p><p>One hundred percent of the province was already electrified, with </p><p>80 percent hooked up to the national power grid.  The roads to all </p><p>villages in the province were paved, although some hamlets were </p><p>still connected by dirt roads.  Clinics manned by physicians </p><p>served every district.  To staff new businesses, Tay Ninh produced </p><p>3000 high school graduates last year, with 1550 passing the </p><p>national university entrance exam.  Overall, one third of all </p><p>school-age children attend school. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  According to the Chairman, the province had attracted </p><p>a total of 50 FDI projects, valued at US$240 million.  Twenty- </p><p>seven projects, worth US$40 million, were invested at the 700- </p><p>hectare Trang Bang Industrial Park, near the border with HCMC. </p><p>With Trang Bang nearly 70 percent full, the province was directing </p><p>new investment to the much larger Moc Bai Economic Zone.  Moc Bai, </p><p>located near the Cambodian border, is the eventual crossing point </p><p>for the Trans-Asia Highway, connecting HCMC with Cambodia and </p><p>points west.  Vietnam\'s portion of the highway was expected to be </p><p>finished this March, but investors recently extended the deadline </p><p>to July.  The Chairman predicted that progress on the Cambodian </p><p>side of the border would be much slower.  Tay Ninh shares a 240- </p><p>kilometer border with Cambodia. </p><p> </p><p>Church and State in Harmony </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Asked to comment by Chairman Lam on the changes he had </p><p>observed on this first trip back in 30 years, the Ambassador cited </p><p>the empty ranks at the top of the Cao Dai hierarchy and the new </p><p>organizational structure.  The role of the Fatherland Front in </p><p>coordinating how the Cao Dai organized their affairs was another </p><p>notable development.  He also regretted GVN restrictions on Cao </p><p>Dai charitable activities, such as schools and orphanages, and </p><p>wondered why there were no Cao Dai in positions of authority in </p><p>the local government when they made up some 40 percent of the </p><p>population.  On the bright side, he praised the familiar images of </p><p>ordinary people continuing to practice their faith. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  The Chairman was prepared with a number of statistics </p><p>to show that the Cao Dai faith had actually grown under the GVN. </p><p>The number of Cao Dai had increased from 35 to 40 percent of the </p><p>provincial population since 1975, even as the total number of </p><p>temples had grown from 25-95.  The number of high-ranking clergy </p><p>increased from 1905 to 2144 during the same period, while the </p><p>number of student priests rose from 1522 to 3480.  He was less </p><p>convincing when he asserted that the issue of replacing the </p><p>elderly clergy was entirely in the hands of the Cao Dai </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  While the Cao Dai had not generally participated in </p><p>local political activities after 1975, Chairman Lam assured the </p><p>Ambassador that the laws of Vietnam give everyone equal access to </p><p>leadership positions.  Some Cao Dai had been active in local </p><p>People\'s Councils since 1986, and he thought it entirely possible </p><p>that a Cao Dai could one day serve as a district Chairman. </p><p>Despite the current lack of Cao Dai adherents in important </p><p>positions, he pointed to Tay Ninh as a place where there was great </p><p>unity between the religious and the secular.  The Chairman also </p><p>praised the Cao Dai for their assistance to flood victims and </p><p>orphans in the recent past. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>17.  (SBU)  Amidst Tay Ninh\'s relative political stability, </p><p>there\'s little doubt that the province is well positioned to </p><p>benefit economically from its proximity to HCMC.  Decent roads, or </p><p>at least roads that appeared to be under active construction, led </p><p>to and from HCMC.  Immediate economic returns from improved </p><p>overland access to the rest of mainland Southeast Asia are less of </p><p>a sure thing.  Tourism, while it will continue to be a big draw, </p><p>needs to avoid the temptation of appealing to the lowest common </p><p>denominator.  A steady stream of Western and Asian tourists visit </p><p>the temple each day during the noon service, a staple for </p><p>inexpensive tours from HCMC.  Paving over the greenery and </p><p>blasting loud music from cheaply constructed souvenir and food </p><p>stalls, however, is not going to attract a sustained influx of big- </p><p>spending Western tourists. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  The Archbishop was careful not to express openly any </p><p>disagreement with the Management Committee structure, but the </p><p>empty ranks at the top of his religion\'s hierarchy is obviously a </p><p>source of frustration and concern.  For his part, the Chairman of </p><p>the People\'s Committee seems to realize the importance of </p><p>cultivating relations with the Cao Dai, a job made easier by the </p><p>fact that the church leadership has completely lost its pre-1975 </p><p>role as a political entity.  Our impression during this short </p><p>visit to Tay Ninh was that the Cao Dai religion is now treated </p><p>much the same as Buddhism and Catholicism: worship is fully </p><p>tolerated, the numbers of the faithful even allowed to expand </p><p>somewhat, but the party and state maintain tight control over the </p><p>religion\'s organizational structure. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
