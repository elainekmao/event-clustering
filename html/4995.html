<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 000143 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PM GUL\'S JANUARY 6 VISIT: IN PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS BOTH SIDES STRESS NEED TO AVERT WAR, MAINTAIN </p><p>IRAQI TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul met with King </p><p>Abdullah and Jordanian PM Ali Abul Ragheb January 6 in Amman, </p><p>in the third stop of Gul\'s trip through the region.  The </p><p>visit was given prominent above-the-fold coverage in all of </p><p>the Kingdom\'s Arabic and English dailies.  Press accounts, </p><p>quoting generously from PM Abul Ragheb, stressed the two </p><p>countries\' agreement to "speed up efforts to peacefully </p><p>resolve the deadlock between Iraq and the U.S., avoiding a </p><p>war in the region."  A one-page official statement noted that </p><p>the two sides had agreed that "all efforts exerted to resolve </p><p>the crisis should be made under the umbrella of the UN." </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Following his meeting with PM Abul Ragheb, Gul held a </p><p>press conference in which he stated: "All our efforts are </p><p>being made to prevent a war from erupting in the region whose </p><p>repercussion would be very dramatic."  He added that "the </p><p>official policy of the Turkish Republic is to preserve the </p><p>unity of Iraq\'s territory and that the entire Iraqi people </p><p>benefit from the riches of Iraq."  The official Jordan News </p><p>Agency, Petra, quoted PM Abul Ragheb as saying that any </p><p>military action would have "very negative consequences on </p><p>regional peace, security and economy."  The Jordanian PM, </p><p>according to Petra, also reiterated "the Kingdom\'s position </p><p>rejecting the use of its territories and airspace in any </p><p>\'aggression\' against Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) As reported separately, the King was much more </p><p>constructive in his private remarks to his Turkish visitor </p><p>than Jordan\'s public statements would indicate.  The </p><p>Jordanian government is clearly still wary of moving away </p><p>from its longstanding public position, which unsurprisingly </p><p>shows considerable deference to widespread opposition among </p><p>Jordanians to conflict with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
