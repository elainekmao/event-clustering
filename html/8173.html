(SBU) SUMMARY.  A recent Middle East regional workshop on </p><p>wastewater reuse in agriculture, jointly-organized by USDA, </p><p>USEPA, and USGS, brought together about 25 Jordanians, </p><p>Palestinians, and Israelis for several days of presentations </p><p>and sharing of information and experiences.  Despite the </p><p>current political climate in the region, all individuals </p><p>participated fully, clearly taking advantage of each other\'s </p><p>expertise to learn from one another and to develop personal </p><p>relationships on the margins.  An unplanned "bonus" of the </p><p>workshop was the ability of Turkish Cypriots, whose </p><p>attendance was made possible by the relaxing of restrictions </p><p>on checkpoint crossings several weeks ago, to interact with </p><p>their Greek Cypriot counterparts who helped host the event </p><p>in Nicosia.  Encouraging bi-communal cooperation on the </p><p>Cypriot front with Middle East regional cooperation among </p><p>the core peace process parties made for a winning </p><p>combination and underscored the necessity for close </p><p>coordination on scarce water resources.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>EXPANDING THE CIRCLE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) From May 6-10, USDA, USEPA, and USGS jointly </p><p>convened an "International Workshop on Wastewater Reuse and </p><p>Water-related Agricultural Practices" in Nicosia, Cyprus, </p><p>for Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli technical experts. </p><p>Also in attendance were representatives from the Greek and </p><p>Turkish Cypriot communities who have been working together </p><p>on similar issues of common concern through a bi-communal </p><p>project sponsored by the U.S. government.  The workshop, the </p><p>first such activity bringing together these regional experts </p><p>from their respective ministries of water, agriculture, and </p><p>environment, was an ambitious undertaking that has already </p><p>paid dividends. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Covering topics from irrigation design, crop water </p><p>requirements, water reuse guidelines and regulatory schemes, </p><p>reuse practices, treatment technologies, chemical and </p><p>microbial pathogens, real-time water quality monitoring, to </p><p>artificial recharge, the workshop was a comprehensive </p><p>overview of a subject increasingly being explored to stretch </p><p>the Middle East\'s critical water resources.  Technical </p><p>experts representing the USDA, USEPA, and USGS introduced </p><p>the participants to U.S. approaches to wastewater reuse </p><p>practices, providing the basis for discussion and some </p><p>technology transfer.  Each of the core parties presented </p><p>their experiences, fostering friendly and constructive </p><p>debate on different approaches to the subject. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) We were particularly excited and gratified to </p><p>welcome so many new participants to the cooperative regional </p><p>water process.  For many years, much of the work has </p><p>remained within the confines of EXACT (the Executive Action </p><p>Committee), an element of the Middle East Peace Process </p><p>Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources, and reliant </p><p>upon the excellent professional and personal relationships </p><p>of the members developed over years of contact.  This new </p><p>activity represents a new mechanism for increasing regional </p><p>cooperation on water-related issues and introduces a new set </p><p>of Palestinian, Jordanian, and Israeli actors eager to build </p><p>the necessary bridges to peaceful co-existence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ATTRACTING INTERNATIONAL DONORS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Official representatives from the EU and France, as </p><p>well as a Dutch water expert working in the Middle East, </p><p>also attended the workshop and shared their experiences in </p><p>wastewater reuse.  The idea behind including them was to </p><p>encourage other international donors to consider </p><p>participating in or funding future complementary activities </p><p>in the wastewater reuse sphere.  This was not lost on the </p><p>savvy Palestinians and Jordanians who sought to capitalize </p><p>on their presence.  The EU, France, and the Netherlands are </p><p>already active donors in Middle East regional water </p><p>projects, as are the Canadians and Norwegians.  The EU </p><p>representative indicated by the end of the session that he </p><p>would be interested in assisting financially with future </p><p>regional wastewater reuse projects involving the core </p><p>parties. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOLLOW-ON ACTIVITIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) At the conclusion of the workshop, the core parties </p><p>discussed possible next steps and are anxious to maintain </p><p>the momentum by focusing on developing a small regional </p><p>project on a topic related to wastewater reuse in </p><p>agriculture.  With an eye toward penetrating the restrictive </p><p>European produce market, there were ambitious discussions </p><p>about harmonizing regional wastewater standards and </p><p>guidelines but, while we welcomed this optimistic and </p><p>forward-thinking approach, all agreed to focus initial </p><p>efforts on more achievable short-term projects.  We are also </p><p>exploring the possibility of a list server to encourage the </p><p>continuation of discussion among participants (core parties </p><p>and U.S. technical experts alike) as well as the development </p><p>of a website highlighting this new cooperative effort on </p><p>wastewater reuse. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  OUR FIRST SUCCESS STORY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) All in all, this was an excellently conceived and </p><p>executed workshop, introducing a new topic for regional </p><p>cooperation to a broad range and large group of Jordanian, </p><p>Palestinian, and Israeli technical experts.  We are </p><p>confident that the high level of interest and bonds formed </p><p>at this inception meeting can be sustained and will produce </p><p>further opportunities for collaboration. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) One of the highlights of the workshop was when the </p><p>Israeli delegation head, after talking to the Palestinian </p><p>leader about problems the Palestinians were having in </p><p>building a wastewater treatment plant in Tulkarem, picked up </p><p>the phone and put in a call to the Israeli security chief </p><p>and local Israeli mayor to get the issue resolved.  A </p><p>conference call between our Palestinian and Israeli </p><p>participants, Israeli Defense Forces, and municipal </p><p>officials from both the Palestinian and Israeli towns seems </p><p>to have built the necessary trust to put the project back on </p><p>track. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
