O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: White Farmers Remain Divided </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 239 b) Harare 267 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Justice for Agriculture (JAG) </p><p>representatives told us they strongly lament the </p><p>willingness of the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) to </p><p>engage the Government of Robert Mugabe on fast-track land </p><p>reform.  JAG remains committed to dialogue with the GOZ </p><p>only after the restoration of rule-of-law.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) JAG reps recently updated Amb. Sullivan on their </p><p>campaign against Mugabe\'s land reform.  JAG says around </p><p>300 members have joined its ranks, which usually entails </p><p>resigning from the more moderate CFU.  The organizations </p><p>differ more on tactics than assessments of fast-track </p><p>land reform. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) JAG takes issue with the CFU\'s restarting a </p><p>dialogue with the GOZ, analyzed in refs a-b.  JAG members </p><p>feel the GOZ is merely using talks with the CFU as a </p><p>means of persuading Western governments that a) white </p><p>farmers now approve of land reform and b) it is time to </p><p>lift sanctions and support resettled farmers.  JAG </p><p>refuses to speak with the GOZ, which it considers </p><p>illegitimate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: The split among white farmers reflects </p><p>diverging interests.  JAG members have mostly lost farms </p><p>and wish to pursue title claims indefinitely in the hope </p><p>of restitution or compensation; CFU members are often </p><p>still trying to hold onto all or part of their farms.  If </p><p>a successor government one day comes to power, JAG\'s </p><p>strident line could prove an impediment to revamping land </p><p>reform.  While we agree that land reform has been unjust </p><p>and devastating to Zimbabwean agriculture, we do not </p><p>believe a future government could completely reverse it </p><p>or pay full compensation.  The only way to make sense of </p><p>the senseless may be a negotiated deal that returns white </p><p>farmers to a portion of their farms, in exchange for them </p><p>relinquishing title to the other portion and assisting </p><p>new farmers.  As time wears on, however, such an </p><p>agreement becomes less and less feasible and we do agree </p><p>that GOZ dialogue with the CFU to date has been mostly </p><p>for show with little or no serious effort at compromise. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
