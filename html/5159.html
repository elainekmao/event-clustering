<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000116 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIS, SENV, ETRD, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOH RESPONSE TO TEDS VERIFICATION REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 06760 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. Per reftel request, on January 13, Econoff </p><p>delivered demarche talking points to Vice Minister of </p><p>Agriculture German Perez on the outcome of the December </p><p>visit to the island of Roatan by USG fisheries officials to </p><p>inspect Honduras\' TEDs program and the plans to de-certify </p><p>Honduras to export commercially harvested shrimp to the U.S. </p><p>The Ambassador had previously contacted President Maduro on </p><p>January 9 to alert him of the possible de-certification. </p><p>Perez blamed the lack of TEDs compliance on a change in </p><p>government last February that resulted in a turnover in </p><p>fisheries inspectors.  Perez reiterated the importance of </p><p>shrimp exports to the Honduran economy and is eager to get </p><p>their TEDs program back on track.  The GOH will formulate a </p><p>proposal detailing their plans to strengthen the TEDs </p><p>program and requesting additional TEDs training before USG </p><p>fisheries officials return for another TEDs inspection. </p><p>Perez remarked that they are interested in getting re- </p><p>certified before the 2003 commercial shrimp season begins in </p><p>July of 2003.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador Palmer spoke with President Maduro the </p><p>evening of January 9, alerting him that during a December </p><p>inspection of Honduras\' TEDs program, USG fisheries </p><p>officials found major problems with the implementation of </p><p>TEDS and that Honduras would most likely have its TEDs </p><p>certification withdrawn, resulting in a ban on the </p><p>exportation of commercially harvested shrimp to the U.S. </p><p>Maduro appreciated the call, reiterated the importance of </p><p>shrimp exports to the U.S. and promised to look into the </p><p>matter. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Econoff met with Vice Minister of Agriculture German </p><p>Perez on January 13 to deliver reftel demarche talking </p><p>points and brief him on the TEDs team\'s findings.  Econoff </p><p>encouraged Perez to consider formulating a proposal for a </p><p>training program on the proper implementation and </p><p>supervision of TEDs.  Perez had spoken with Roatan fisheries </p><p>officials before the meeting to get a readout on the </p><p>December inspection.  Perez suggested that the change in </p><p>government last February resulted in a high turnover of </p><p>personnel, including fisheries officials and inspectors in </p><p>the Ministry of Agriculture, and that new employees have not </p><p>been properly trained on TED\'s implementation and inspection </p><p>procedures.  Perez also offered the weak argument that a </p><p>culture of lawlessness exists on Roatan and that inspection </p><p>officials are often intimidated into not performing their </p><p>duties. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Perez responded enthusiastically about the prospects </p><p>of receiving further TEDs training for fisheries officials, </p><p>noting the importance of shrimp exports to the Honduran </p><p>economy.  Post will continue to encourage the GOH to develop </p><p>a plan to implement and regulate the use of TEDs on </p><p>commercial fishing boats and will forward the Ministry\'s </p><p>proposal for training as soon as it is received. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The GOH feels they have a small window of opportunity </p><p>to get their TEDs program back on line and get re-certified. </p><p>The 2002 commercial shrimping season officially closes </p><p>January 31, 2003, and the 2003 season is projected to open </p><p>in early July, giving the GOH a five to six-month period to </p><p>turn its TEDs program around.  Post notes that the GOH </p><p>received TEDs training in 2001 and was subsequently re- </p><p>certified to export commercially harvested shrimp.  While </p><p>Post believes that GOH officials are sincere in their desire </p><p>to be TEDs compliant, we recommend that USG fisheries </p><p>officials make sure that the GOH takes the necessary </p><p>measures to ensure that their TEDs program will remain </p><p>compliant in the coming years.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
