Ankara </p><p>insists that the flow of Iraqi oil from Kirkuk to Yumurtalik </p><p>should begin as soon as possible.  Turkey and the U.S.  have </p><p>agreed to use the port of Iskenderun as a key shipping point </p><p>in  the reconstruction of Iraq, papers report.  Uneasy  with </p><p>the  attitude of KDP leader Barzani, Ankara is preparing  to </p><p>open  a  new  border gate to Iraq, close to the border  with </p><p>Syria,  to  by-pass the Kurdish-controlled  Habur  crossing, </p><p>thus  depriving  Barzani  of  a  major  source  of  revenue, </p><p>Thursday\'s "Zaman" reports.  Kurds have been alarmed by  the </p><p>proposal,  and have voiced hope that the UN would not  allow </p><p>such a move.  Papers highlight `Iraqi Governor\' Jay Garner\'s </p><p>remarks about Kirkuk being a Kurdish city after he was given </p><p>a  cheerful welcome by the Kurds.  Garner was given a king\'s </p><p>welcome by Kurds in Kirkuk and Irbil, where he said the U.S. </p><p>would stay in Iraq until a democratic regime is established. </p><p>The U.S. has a strong relationship with Turkey, Garner said, </p><p>and  voiced hope that Ankara would get along well  with  the </p><p>new administration in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish  Cypriot government allows passage to South:  Papers </p><p>continue  extensive  coverage  of  Turkish  Cypriot   leader </p><p>Denktas\' decision to bring down the wall dividing the island </p><p>by  opening border checkpoints so the island\'s ethnic Greeks </p><p>and  Turks can cross over for day trips.  Thursday\'s  papers </p><p>report  that 2,000 Turkish and 1,300 Greek Cypriots  crossed </p><p>the  border  on  the  first  day of  the  implementation  of </p><p>unrestricted  passage.  All papers hail the  end  of  travel </p><p>ban,  particularly highlighting the warm  welcome  given  to </p><p>Greek Cypriots returning to the Turkish sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>`Turban\'  crisis  at reception: President Sezer,  opposition </p><p>party   CHP,  and  the  military  boycotted  the  April   23 </p><p>Children\'s  Day reception in a dispute over the  possibility </p><p>that  the  wife of parliamentary speaker Arinc would wear  a </p><p>headscarf.   The  incident highlights tensions  between  the </p><p>ruling  AKP  and secularists.  In an effort  to  reduce  the </p><p>tension, Arinc and Prime Minister Erdogan opted not to bring </p><p>their  wives to the reception.  However, about a half  dozen </p><p>spouses  of  parliamentary deputies did turn up in  scarves. </p><p>AKP  officials  said that the boycott was an insult  to  the </p><p>parliament.   Erdogan criticized the president and  military </p><p>commanders, saying they had no right to boycott the national </p><p>holiday.   Arinc\'s announcement the day before the reception </p><p>that  his wife would not attend the event was not enough  to </p><p>convince  Sezer and the TGS, papers note.  Mainstream  media </p><p>believe  that the headscarf tension has exacerbated  a  rift </p><p>between  the government and the state.  "Vatan" claims  that </p><p>Prime  Minister  Erdogan was uneasy  with  the  attitude  of </p><p>Speaker  Arinc.   Erdogan dreams of  becoming  president  by </p><p>introducing  a presidential system to Turkey, and  wants  to </p><p>avoid  tension  with key national and international  actors, </p><p>according to "Vatan," while Arinc is trying to increase  his </p><p>power in the AKP by taking advantage of his post. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Post War Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US strategy for Iraq" </p><p>Umit  Kardas commented in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (4/24): </p><p>"The  post-war  situation  has  proved  that  none  of   the </p><p>arguments  for  the Iraq war was real, but  only  served  to </p><p>justify the genuine intention: the invasion of Iraq.  The US </p><p>is not worried about the democratization of Iraq.  The US is </p><p>clearly  trying to establish a puppet regime  to  serve  its </p><p>interests in the post-Saddam era.   . It also seems that the </p><p>US  will  continue  to  promote more military  spending  and </p><p>implement  serious cuts in the social security budget.   The </p><p>US  focus  will be to encourage global rearmament under  the </p><p>guise of the war against terrorism.  The reelection campaign </p><p>of  President  Bush could run into serious  opposition.   As </p><p>Noam  Chomsky  put it, we will either have a  world  without </p><p>war, or we won\'t have a world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Shiite lessons for Washington and Ankara" </p><p>Cengiz  Candar  noted  in  the  conservative  Dunden  Bugune </p><p>Tercuman  (4/24): "In the post-war Iraq, there are  two  new </p><p>major players on the Iraqi political scene that the US  will </p><p>have to deal with: Iraqi Shiites and Iraqi Kurds. . It seems </p><p>that  due  to the Iraqi Shiite factor, the US will  be  even </p><p>more   sympathetic  toward  the  `secular-democratic-federal </p><p>Iraq\'  thesis  of  the  Kurds.  The US will  definitely  not </p><p>tolerate  a  sympathetic  approach from  Turkey  toward  the </p><p>possible establishment of an Islamic Republic of Iraq.   The </p><p>lesson  for Ankara is that since there is no way of bringing </p><p>back  Saddam  to power, Turkey better make its policy  clear </p><p>about what type of Iraq it wants to see." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
