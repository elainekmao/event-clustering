<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 000452 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, UK, MD, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: "RUSSIAN" PROSTITUTION IN ISTANBUL </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1396 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In separate March 26 meetings, Istanbul contacts </p><p>confirmed that illegal foreign prostitution in Istanbul </p><p>remains widespread, and that criminal networks, and possibly </p><p>even corrupted officials, have a lucrative stake in the </p><p>business.   Marmara University sociologist professor Nilufer </p><p>Narli told poloff that foreign prostitution, particularly </p><p>involving "Russians," remains widespread in various </p><p>neighborhoods of Istanbul (Note: Such women are generally </p><p>Moldovan, but also come from the other countries in the </p><p>region.  End Note).  In addition to cheap hotels and bars </p><p>which play host to foreign prostitution in Taksim, Laleli, </p><p>and Aksaray, Sisli District Governor Osman Demir confirmed </p><p>that  prostitution is also widespread in the night clubs of </p><p>the Elmadag neighborhhod in Sisli.  Asked how many of these </p><p>women might have been involuntarily forced into this work, </p><p>both Narli and Demir said that the overwhelming majority work </p><p>voluntarily.  Demir maintained that many are primarily </p><p>"suitcase traders," who simply "raise capital" by engaging in </p><p>prostitution on the side.  Narli said that her research had </p><p>not found many such women, although she admitted that there </p><p>are probably some young women who are lured to Istanbul under </p><p>the expectation that they will engage in other work (as </p><p>waitresses, maids, or babysitters), and are pressured into </p><p>prostitution by economic circumstances or even by force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Both Demir and Narli said that criminal groups have a </p><p>major stake in the prostitution business.  Demir (who </p><p>oversees the security apparatus for the Sisli district) told </p><p>poloff that he believes both local and international groups </p><p>are involved.  In addition to the mafia elements, Narli added </p><p>that there are "undoubtedly" corrupt officials who profit </p><p>from these illegal activities.  She pointed to the fact that </p><p>some of the hotels and other establishments where such </p><p>prostitution occurs are even owned by retired police </p><p>officials.  The fact that even the highest levels of Turkish </p><p>society use such prostitutes (or at least the exclusive </p><p>high-end "escorts"), Narli suggested, may be why such illegal </p><p>activities are tolerated.  Separately, Demir noted that the </p><p>sharp disparity between the economic prospects such women </p><p>face at home compared with what they can earn in Istanbul </p><p>will always make it difficult for the authorities to control </p><p>such activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: These remarks largely track with what we </p><p>had understood to be the situation here in Istanbul.  It is </p><p>interesting that both of these contacts raised the subject on </p><p>their own in meetings on other subjects, suggesting to us </p><p>that our contacts are increasingly aware of our concerns </p><p>regarding trafficking in persons. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
