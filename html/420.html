<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BOGOTA 18530 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBIA: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 355397; (B) BOGOTA 5568; (C) BOGOTA 14054; </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  COLOMBIA\'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS CONFRONTED BY </p><p>THREE LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS </p><p>VIOLENT, WELL-FINANCED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  BOTH THE INSURGENTS AND THE TRAFFICKERS </p><p>USE TERRORISM, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST DOMESTIC </p><p>TARGETS.  GUERRILLA VIOLENCE CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES </p><p>HAVE AT TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA </p><p>AND ECUADOR. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>PROSECUTIONS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  THERE WERE NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM IN COLOMBIA IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  NUMEROUS ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM OCCURED IN 1990, </p><p>SOME THE RESULT OF GUERRILLA INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGNS </p><p>AGAINST RURAL POPULATIONS.  GUERRILLAS REGULARLY TORTURE </p><p>AND MURDER PEASANTS AND OTHERS SUSPECTED OF ASSISTING </p><p>GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS, HOWEVER, WERE COMMITTED BY THE LOOSE </p><p>CONGLOMERATE OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS KNOWN AS THE </p><p>MEDELLIN CARTEL.  IN AUGUST 1989 THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED </p><p>A CRACKDOWN AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOLLOWING A </p><p>STRING OF POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO THE </p><p>CARTEL.  THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS RESPONDED WITH A </p><p>VIOLENT CAMPAIGN OF BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATIONS OF </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES AND POLICEMEN THAT CONTINUED INTO </p><p>1990.  THE BOMBINGS WERE INTENDED TO INDUCE THE PUBLIC </p><p>INTO PRESSURING THE GOVERNMENT INTO MAKING CONCESSIONS </p><p>TO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE </p><p>MEANT TO INTIMIDATE POLITICAL FIGURES OPPOSED TO THE </p><p>TRAFFICKER\'S INTERESTS AND DISRUPT COLOMBIA\'S DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN MARCH AND APRIL SUSPECTED NARCO-TERRORISTS </p><p>ASSASSINATED THE TWO LEADING LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATES.  IN MAY NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS BEGAN A </p><p>COP-KILLING CAMPAIGN IN MEDELLIN, CONTRIBUTING TO A </p><p>RECORD HIGH 521 POLICEMEN KILLED IN ALL OF COLOMBIA AS </p><p>OF OCTOBER 16.  RANDOM STREETCORNER MASSACRES IN </p><p>MEDELLIN SOON FOLLOWED THE ATTACKS ON POLICEMEN, </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH-LEVEL OF TERRORISM IN </p><p>MEDELLIN.  SPECIFIC TERRORIST ACTS MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>COMMITTED BY THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS IN RETALIATION </p><p>FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLICE KILLING </p><p>OF ONE OF ESCOBAR\'S TOP AIDES IN JUNE WAS FOLLOWED HOURS </p><p>LATER BY THE EXPLOSION OF A CAR BOMB WHICH KILLED THREE </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW PRESIDENT </p><p>AUGUST 7, THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CHANGED THEIR </p><p>TACTICS.  DURING SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, THE GROUP OF </p><p>TRAFFICKERS KNOWN AS "THE EXTRADITABLES" KIDNAPPED NINE </p><p>PROMINENT COLOMBIANS, MOSTLY JOURNALISTS.  IT IS WIDELY </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE KIDNAPPERS\' AIM IS TO INFLUENCE THE </p><p>CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, SCHEDULED TO MEET IN FEBRUARY TO </p><p>REFORM THE CONSTITUTION.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE </p><p>TRAFFICKERS WANT THE ASSEMBLY TO PROHIBIT </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIAN CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>EXTRADITION REQUESTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA MADE NO REQUESTS FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION AND EXTRADITION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  REF B, PLUS PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORTING, DESCRIBES </p><p>THE PROFOUND PROBLEMS OF THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM, </p><p>WHICH IS OUTDATED, INEFFECTIVE, AND VULNERABLE TO </p><p>CORRUPTION AND INTIMIDATION.  GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO </p><p>ARREST AND PROSECUTE THOSE WHO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, </p><p>BUT IN REALITY THOSE WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES ARE RARELY </p><p>CAUGHT.  THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS IMPLEMENTING A </p><p>JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAM IT HOPES WILL STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE GOC CURRENTLY HAS NO LEGAL MECHANISM FOR </p><p>EXTRADITING A COLOMBIAN TO THE U.S. FOR CRIMES OTHER </p><p>THAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING.  IN AUGUST 1989 COLOMBIA </p><p>RESUMED EXTRADITIONS BY EXECUTIVE DECREE, FOLLOWING </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH EXTRADITIONS WERE PROHIBITED </p><p>BY A 1987 SUPREME COURT RULING.  THE 1989 DECREE ONLY </p><p>PROVIDES FOR THE EXTRADITION OF THOSE ACCUSED OF </p><p>NARCOTICS-RELATED CRIMES.  INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>CRIMES ARE NOT INCLUDED.  IN SEPTEMBER THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROMULGATED A DECREE (REF C) GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM </p><p>EXTRADITION TO THOSE WHO CONFESS NARCOTICS OR </p><p>TERRORIST-RELATED CRIMES.  ONLY ONE TRAFFICKER HAS TAKEN </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THIS DECREE, HOWEVER, AND COLOMBIA </p><p>CONTINUES TO EXTRADITE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN JUNE 1990 THE GOC ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR FIVE </p><p>BRITISH MERCENARIES ACCUSED OF TRAINING PARA-MILITARY </p><p>GROUPS FOR COLOMBIA\'S NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  COLOMBIA </p><p>HAS A VALID EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM, </p><p>BUT APPARENTLY HAS MADE NO REQUEST FOR THEIR EXTRADITION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REGULARLY CONDEMN </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL.  THE </p><p>GOC WAS THE PRIMARY INSTIGATOR OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO </p><p>AN ANTIGUA-BROKERED ISRAELI ARMS SALE TO COLOMBIAN </p><p>NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  IN JULY THE JUSTICE MINISTRY </p><p>CONDUCTED A MAJOR SHAKEUP OF COLOMBIA\'S PUBLIC ORDER </p><p>COURTS, RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING TERRORISM CASES, IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE COURTS\' PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN NOVEMBER THE GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A MAJOR ATTACK </p><p>ON THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT BASE OF COLOMBIA\'S LARGEST </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUP, DEALING A BLOW TO THAT GROUP\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO CONDUCT TERRORIST ACTS.  COLOMBIA AGGRESSIVELY </p><p>CAMPAIGNS IN THE UN AND THE OAS FOR ADOPTION OF </p><p>RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL ARMS </p><p>TRADE.  COLOMBIA HAS ALSO CALLED FOR TIGHTER </p><p>RESTRICTIONS IN LEGITIMATE ARMS TRANSFERS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  COLOMBIA PROVIDES NO SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM OR TERRORIST GROUPS, NOR HAS THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN FAVOR OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  IN 1980 COLOMBIA BROKE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CUBA BECAUSE OF THE LATTER\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1989 </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM.  THE GOC CONTINUES TO </p><p>CONDEMN TERRORISM AND PROSECUTE TERRORISTS TO THE BEST </p><p>OF ITS VERY LIMITED ABILITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOBBS </p><p></p></div>
