<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 02/21/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, SOCI, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Some Buddhist monks protest peace process, but </p><p>most seem favorably inclined or neutral at this time </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 280, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  A small group of Buddhist monks aligned </p><p>with the radical JVP party is regularly taking to the </p><p>streets to protest the GSL\'s peace initiative.  The vast </p><p>majority of Sri Lanka\'s monks, however, seem favorably </p><p>inclined or at least neutral toward the peace process. </p><p>The GSL continues to work to placate monastic opinion, </p><p>which is historically important in majority Buddhist Sri </p><p>Lanka.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RADICAL MONKS: A small group of Buddhist </p><p>monks is regularly taking to the streets to protest the </p><p>Sri Lankan government\'s peace initiative.  The monks, </p><p>organized into a group called the National Bhikku Front </p><p>(NBF), are aligned with the radical Janantha Vimukthi </p><p>Peramuna (JVP) party.  Like the JVP, the NBF is rabidly </p><p>Sinhalese chauvinist, accusing the government of giving </p><p>in too much to the demands of the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the course of the peace process. </p><p>According to contacts, the NBF may have a membership of </p><p>several hundred monks, a small fraction of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>16,000 registered Buddhist monks.  (Note:  Several </p><p>thousand monks are not registered, and there are </p><p>believed to be around 25,000 monks total in the </p><p>country.)   As the JVP mobilizes anti-government marches </p><p>and rallies around the country, NBF monks are playing a </p><p>conspicuous role.  On February 20, for example, many </p><p>saffron- and red-robed NBF monks participated in a </p><p>tumultuous JVP-sponsored rally, which tied up traffic in </p><p>parts of Colombo.  In the February 21 papers, photos of </p><p>these monks were splashed on the front pages of several </p><p>newspapers.  In past marches, NBF monks have also </p><p>protested outside the Norwegian Embassy, burning the </p><p>Norwegian flag and demanding the end of the Norwegian </p><p>government\'s peace facilitation role. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Other than the NBF monks, there is also a very </p><p>small group of radical monks associated with a Buddhist </p><p>cleric named Venerable Elle Gunawanse Thera.  Gunawanse </p><p>("Thera" is a Buddhist honorific) recently organized a </p><p>group called "The Alliance to Protect the Nation," which </p><p>is fiercely anti-peace process and anti-Norway\'s peace </p><p>facilitation role.  Gunawanse is considered charismatic </p><p>and some observers believe this factor could potentially </p><p>help him rapidly expand the membership of his group. </p><p>Small groups of monks are also associated with the </p><p>Sinhalese extremist Sihala Urumaya party and with </p><p>another radical cleric named Venerable Gangodawila Soma- </p><p>Thera. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MOST MONKS SEEM PRO-PEACE PROCESS OR NEUTRAL: </p><p>Despite the recent uptick in activities by radical </p><p>monks, most of Sri Lanka\'s monks seem to remain </p><p>favorably inclined toward the peace process, or at least </p><p>neutral.  In forming their opinions, most of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>monks seem to be taking their cue from the major </p><p>monastic orders, the Malwatte and the Asgiriya, which </p><p>control large temple complexes in the city of Kandy in </p><p>central Sri Lanka.  Both the Malwatte and Asgiriya </p><p>Mahanayakes (monastic leaders) have basically made pro- </p><p>peace process soundings since the advent of the peace </p><p>process in December 2001.  Of the two, Asgiriya chief </p><p>Udugama Sri Dhammadassi Rathanapala is the more lucid </p><p>and the more moderate, regularly underscoring in private </p><p>meetings and sometimes in public the need for peace in </p><p>Sri Lanka and reconciliation among ethnic groups. </p><p>Malwatte chief Rambukkwelle Sri Dharmarakshiha is not </p><p>quite as moderate (he sometimes makes Sinhalese Buddhist </p><p>extremist comments to visitors), but, in general, he has </p><p>been careful to utter words that support the peace </p><p>process.  Outside of Malwatte and Asgiriya, leaders of </p><p>some of the other monastic orders -- which support a </p><p>more pietist strain of Buddhism -- have urged their </p><p>followers to stay out of politics altogether and to </p><p>focus solely on temple activities. </p><p>5.  (C) (((Note:  The monastic orders do not tend to </p><p>issue political texts, and in describing monastic </p><p>opinion, one problem is that both the major Mahanayakes </p><p>are aged, hard of hearing and tend to mumble a lot. </p><p>This gives rise to differing interpretations of what </p><p>they say in meetings.  At times, for example, they are </p><p>cited as making strongly pro-peace process comments, and </p><p>at other times almost the opposite.  When asked, their </p><p>assistants admit they are also confused at times by what </p><p>their bosses say.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Another prominent monk who has taken a pro-peace </p><p>process tack is the Venerable Baddegama Samitha. </p><p>Samitha, a MP -- and the first monk ever to serve in the </p><p>Sri Lankan Parliament -- constantly speaks out in favor </p><p>of ethnic reconciliation.  (Note:  Samitha is a member </p><p>of President Kumaratunga\'s People\'s Alliance party, </p><p>representing the LSSP, a Trotskyite party.  While </p><p>moderate on peace process issues, Samitha is bitterly </p><p>anti-U.S. with respect to Iraq policy.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GSL DEALINGS WITH THE MONKS:  Since coming to </p><p>power in late 2001, the United National Front (UNF) </p><p>coalition government has dealt carefully with the monks. </p><p>The Prime Minister and his closest advisers, for </p><p>example, constantly travel to Kandy to meet with the </p><p>Malwatte and Asgiriya Mahanayakes.  During these </p><p>meetings, the PM and other government officials ritually </p><p>announce that the GSL is providing this-or-that </p><p>additional support to Buddhist foundations, temples, and </p><p>sacred sites.  Key government officials, such as </p><p>Minister G.L. Peiris, the chief GSL negotiator, also </p><p>regularly briefs the Mahanayakes on the results of the </p><p>peace talks with the LTTE.  Thus far, these efforts to </p><p>keep the monks in the loop seem to have paid off </p><p>inasmuch as the government has had no major </p><p>confrontations with the monastic orders. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) (((Note:  The United National Party - "UNP," the </p><p>key constituent element of the UNF, also benefits from a </p><p>long-standing network of pro-UNP temples, especially in </p><p>the Colombo area.  These temples, which are quite rich </p><p>due to the patronage of business executives, provide </p><p>important support to the UNP by lending the party </p><p>sterling Buddhist credentials.  Important pro-UNP </p><p>temples in the Colombo area include Gangarama and </p><p>Kelaniya.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Buddhist monastic opinion has been </p><p>historically a crucial factor in post-independence Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Buddhist monks, for example, helped push forward </p><p>the pan-Sinhalese majoritarian politics that afflicted </p><p>the country for decades, helping spark the civil </p><p>conflict that remains unsettled to this day.  Through </p><p>public statements and violent demonstrations, monks also </p><p>helped derail the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka peace accord.  At </p><p>this time, it is unclear whether various societal </p><p>factors, including increased economic wealth, have </p><p>served to diminish the clergy\'s influence through the </p><p>years.  Nonetheless, in a Buddhist majority country </p><p>where monks are still widely admired, the monks remain a </p><p>key group that the GSL needs to placate if the peace </p><p>process is going to succeed.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
