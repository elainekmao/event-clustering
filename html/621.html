<p>S E C R E T STATE 377793 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PARM, PREL, CBW, ETTC, TH, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHITE PAPER ON LIBYA\'S CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: BANGKOK 42119 </p><p></p><p>1.  (S)  PRESENTED BELOW IN PARA 2 IS AN INTERAGENCY </p><p>COORDINATED "WHITE PAPER" ON LIBYA\'S CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) </p><p>PROGRAM.  THIS PAPER IS UNCLASSIFIED AND IS TO BE PROVIDED </p><p>TO THE ROYAL THAI GOVERNMENT FOR ITS USE.  THE PAPER CAN </p><p>BE USED BY THE THAIS IN HELPING TO PREPARE THE CASES </p><p>AGAINST THE THREE THAI FIRMS FOR ASSISTING THE LIBYAN CW </p><p>PROGRAM.  NO OTHER PAPERS ARE PLANNED TO BE GIVEN TO THE </p><p>RTG.  ALTHOUGH, IF A SPECIFIC LEGAL QUESTION ARISES AFTER </p><p>THE THAIS DETERMINE WHICH LAWS OR REGULATIONS THEY PLAN TO </p><p>CHARGE THE FIRMS UNDER, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. </p><p></p><p>2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT OF WHITE PAPER ON LIBYA\'S CW PROGRAM </p><p>RELEASABLE TO RTG: </p><p></p><p>-    LIBYA IS EXPANDING ITS CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT LIBYA IS ENGAGED IN </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS PRODUCTION FACILITIES AT </p><p>THE TARHUNAH SITE.  MOREOVER, THIS EVIDENCE IS IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC DOMAIN, HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY ACTION OF THE UN </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE, AND HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY OTHER </p><p>COMPANIES THAT FORMERLY HAD SUPPLIED THE PROJECT.  IT IS </p><p>NOT CREDIBLE THAT THAI FIRMS PARTICIPATING IN THIS </p><p>CONSTRUCTION ARE  UNAWARE OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS </p><p>FACILITY UNLESS THEY HAVE IMPERMISSIBLY "BURIED THEIR </p><p>HEADS IN THE SAND." </p><p></p><p>LIBYA SHOWS TREMENDOUS RESOLVE IN MOVING ITS OVERALL </p><p>CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) PROGRAM FORWARD.  DESPITE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND POLITICAL PRESSURE </p><p>TRIPOLI\'S PURSUIT OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS BARELY </p><p>DISGUISED.  TRIPOLI\'S ONGOING CW ACTIVITIES AND ITS </p><p>REFUSAL IN JANUARY 1993 TO JOIN A GLOBAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS </p><p>CONVENTION (CWC) SIGNED BY MORE THAN 150 OTHER NATIONS </p><p>UNDERLINE THE JUDGMENT OF MANY GOVERNMENTS THAT LIBYA HAS </p><p>NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP ITS CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM. </p><p></p><p>LIBYA HAS CHEMICAL FACILITIES AT RABTA AND TARHUNAH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p></p><p>LIBYA HAS PRODUCED AT LEAST 100 TONS OF CW AGENTS  MOSTLY </p><p>THE BLISTER AGENT MUSTARD AND SMALLER AMOUNTS OF THE NERVE </p><p>AGENT SARIN. </p><p></p><p>-   LIBYA HAS A CW AGENT PRODUCTION FACILITY AT RABTA </p><p>ALTHOUGH THAT FACILITY CURRENTLY IS INACTIVE.  THE MAXIMUM </p><p>PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR RABTA IS 40 TONS OF CW AGENT </p><p>DAILY, AND THE PLANT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE BLISTER </p><p>AGENT MUSTARD AND HIGHLY LETHAL NERVE AGENTS.  FACILITIES </p><p>AT THE RABTA COMPLEX INCLUDE A METAL FABRICATION AREA FOR </p><p>MAKING MISSILE WARHEADS, BOMBS, AND ARTILLERY SHELLS FOR </p><p>CHEMICAL WARFARE PURPOSES.  THE RABTA COMPLEX WAS BUILT </p><p>WITH ASSISTANCE FROM TECHNICIANS, ENGINEERS. AND LABORERS </p><p>FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES. INCLUDING WEST GERMANY. JAPAN AND </p><p>THAILAND. </p><p></p><p>-   SINCE 1990, TRIPOLI HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO A NEW </p><p>PROJECT--CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST KNOWN </p><p>UNDERGROUND CW PLANT, DEEP IN AN INTERIOR MOUNTAIN NEAR </p><p>TARHUNAH ABOUT 60 KM SOUTHEAST OF TRIPOLI.  EXCAVATION AT </p><p>TARHUNAH, WHICH BEGAN IN 1992  IS GOING FORWARD AND </p><p>ASSEMBLY OF THE PLANT WILL BE COMPLETE WITHIN THE DECADE. </p><p>THE INTERIOR PLANS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UNDERGROUND </p><p>PLANT. PUBLISHED IN THE MAGAZINE "THE ECONOMIST"\'S </p><p>"FOREIGN REPORT\'" INDICATE THAT THE TARHUNAH PLANT IS A </p><p>RECONFIGURED VERSION OF THE RABTA FACILITY.  THE SAME </p><p>LIBYAN PURCHASING OFFICERS INVOLVED WITH THE RABTA PLANT </p><p>ARE NOW WORKING ON DUPLICATING EQUIPMENT ORDERS FROM THOSE </p><p>DESIGNS FOR USE AT TARHUNAH. </p><p></p><p>UNITED NATIONS SANCTIONS COMMITTEE ACKNOWLEDGE TARHUNAH\'S </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>CW LINK </p><p>------- </p><p></p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THROUGH UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTION 748. PASSED ON MARCH 31, 1992, HAS SOUGHT TO </p><p>ISOLATE LIBYA AND CEASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES--IN PART </p><p>THOUGH A BAN ON MILITARY SALES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>LIBYA.  INCLUDED IN THIS BAN IS THE TRANSFER OF CHEMICAL </p><p>WEAPONS-RELATED MATERIAL AND ACTIVITIES. </p><p></p><p>-   THE UN IN RESOLUTION 748 ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT LIBYA IS </p><p>CONSIDERED AN OUTLAW STATE THROUGH VARIOUS OTHER DEMANDS. </p><p>UN MEMBER STATES ARE REQUIRED TO REDUCE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS AND TO DRAW DOWN THEIR OWN REPRESENTATION TO </p><p>LIBYA.  THE RESOLUTION ALSO TERMINATED INTERNATIONAL AIR </p><p>SERVICE TO AND FROM LIBYA. </p><p></p><p>BARRING SHIPMENT TO LIBYA:  IN MARCH 1993  THE UN. </p><p>INVOKING THESE SANCTIONS, BARRED A SHIPMENT OF CHEMICAL </p><p>PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT--REACTOR VESSELS--DESTINED FOR </p><p>LIBYA\'S CW PROGRAM.  LIBYA HAD CLAIMED IT WAS PURCHASING </p><p>THE EQUIPMENT FOR STRICTLY COMMERCIAL USE--TO MAKE </p><p>DRILLING MUD ADDITIVES FOR OIL EXPLORATION.  THE EQUIPMENT </p><p>WAS PRODUCED BY THE MALAYSIAN SUBSIDIARY OF A BRITISH </p><p>FIRM.  SINGAPORE HALTED TRANSSHIPMENT OF THE REACTOR </p><p>VESSELS TO A LIBYAN FACTORY IN BENGHAZI PENDING A UN </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE DETERMINATION.  AFTER THE SANCTIONS </p><p>COMMITTEE FOUND THAT THE SHIPMENT WAS IN VIOLATION OF </p><p>RESOLUTION 748, SINGAPORE REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO BE </p><p>SHIPPED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED THEM TO THE MALAYSIAN </p><p>SHIPPER WHERE THEY REMAIN UNDER MALAYSIAN CUSTOMS CONTROL </p><p>PENDING SALE TO A LEGITIMATE BUYER. </p><p></p><p>GERMAN COMPANIES CEASED SUPPLYING TARHUNAH </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p></p><p>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING GERMAN </p><p>FIRMS FOR DELIVERING EQUIPMENT AND CHEMICALS FOR THE </p><p>TARHUNAH PLAN VIA THIRD COUNTRIES TO AVOID SUSPICION. </p><p>CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL\'S OFFICE CONFIRMED TO THE PRESS IN </p><p>MID-FEBRUARY 1993 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD RECEIVED </p><p>INFORMATION THAT GERMAN FIRMS WERE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING </p><p>MATERIAL FOR LIBYA\'S CLANDESTINE CW PROJECT.  AT LEAST TWO </p><p>IMPLICATED FIRMS IMMEDIATELY AGREED TO BONN\'S DEMANDS TO </p><p>STOP ANY FURTHER DELIVERIES, THE SPOKESMAN SAID. </p><p></p><p>GERMAN PROSECUTION OF CASES AGAINST FIRMS DEALING WITH </p><p>LIBYAN CW PROGRAMS DATES BACK TO 1990.  INITIALLY, THE </p><p>WEST GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER SAID THAT INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>THE RABTA PLANT WAS TOO VAGUE FOR BONN TO PURSUE COMPANIES </p><p>INVOLVED.  ALTHOUGH THE BONN GOVERNMENT AT FIRST STRONGLY </p><p>DENIED ALLEGATIONS THAT GERMAN FIRMS HAD SUPPLIED AND </p><p>BUILT A CW FACTORY IN LIBYA, AFTER EXTENSIVE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS IT FOUND THE CHARGES WERE TRUE.  THE GERMAN </p><p>FIRM IMHAUSEN-CHEMIE STATED IN COURT THAT RABTA IS A </p><p>POISON GAS PLANT, AND THE FIRM\'S OWNER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR VIOLATION OF EXPORT </p><p>CONTROL LAWS. </p><p></p><p>THAI NATIONALS ARE INVOLVED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p></p><p>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT CONCLUDED THAT A THAI BUSINESSMAN </p><p>WITH AN ENGINEERING DEGREE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN BUILDING </p><p>THE RABTA PLANT PROVIDED CRITICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>TARHUNAH PLANT, AS INDICATED IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER.  THE </p><p>THAI EXPERT COPIED THE PLANS FOR THE RABTA FACILITY, </p><p>ALTERED THEM, AND THEN CONTACTED GERMAN COMPANIES FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN BUILDING AND EQUIPPING THE FACILITIES.  THAI </p><p>COMPANIES HAD TAKEN OVER CW PROJECTS IN LIBYA AFTER GERMAN </p><p>AND JAPANESE CONTRACTORS WERE FORCED TO WITHDRAW IN THE </p><p>1980S UNDER PRESSURE FROM THEIR GOVERNMENTS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>A PRESS REPORT IN "THE NEW TIMES." </p><p></p><p>THE THAI FIRM W AND M LIMITED PARTNERSHIP HAS ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT IT IS THE SOLE SOURCE FOR TUNNELING DESIGN AND </p><p>EXCAVATION WORK AT THE TARHUNAH SITE.  WIROTE </p><p>SUKUNMUTHITA, OF W AND M, TOLD THE PRESS THAT HIS COMPANY </p><p>WAS HIRED THREE YEARS AGO TO DESIGN THE TUNNELS.  HE ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT ABOUT 60 THAI WORKERS, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF </p><p>ENGINEERS, WERE ASSIGNED TO THE TARHUNAH PROJECT. </p><p></p><p>LIBYA\'S DENIALS ARE NOT CREDIBLE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>COL. MU\'AMMAR QADHAFI CONTINUES TO DENY THAT LIBYA </p><p>POSSESSES A CW PROGRAM AND THAT HE IS BUILDING AN </p><p>UNDERGROUND CW PLANT AT TARHUNAH.  LIBYA STILL INSISTS </p><p>THAT THE CW PLANT AT RABTA WAS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE ONLY </p><p>PHARMACEUTICALS AND THAT TARHUNAH IS A CIVILIAN PROJECT. </p><p>WHILE CONTINUING EXCAVATION, LIBYA HAS STRIVED TO PROVIDE </p><p>A SEEMINGLY PLAUSIBLE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR THE </p><p>INTENSIVE TUNNELING ACTIVITY THAT BEGAN IN 1992. </p><p></p><p>THE LIBYAN DENIALS ABOUT TARHUNAH, HOWEVER, ARE </p><p>REMINISCENT OF TRIPOLI\'S PAST ATTEMPTS TO CONCEAL THE TRUE </p><p>CW NATURE OF THE "RABIA PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY.   TRIPOLI </p><p>CLAIMS TARHUNAH IS A TUNNEL EXCAVATION TRAINING SITE FOR </p><p>LIBYAN WORKERS ON THE MUCH PUBLICIZED CIVILIAN "GREAT </p><p>MANMADE RIVER PROJECT," WHICH IS NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>VICINITY.  IN FEBRUARY 1993, LIBYAN TELEVISION AIRED A </p><p>STAGED VISIT BY QADHAFI TO THE TUNNELS, AND THE LIBYAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS INVITED THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MEDIA TO TOUR THE EXCAVATION.  THE LIBYANS PROBABLY </p><p>ANTICIPATED THAT INSPECTORS WOULD BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY </p><p>THE FACILITY AS CW-RELATED BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE EARLY </p><p>STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION AND NO PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT IS YET </p><p>PRESENT. </p><p></p><p>TRIPOLI HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MANIPULATING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OPINION, WHILE CONSTRUCTING AND RUNNING A CW </p><p>FACILITY.  DURING THE 1980S, LIBYA CLANDESTINELY </p><p>ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL PROCUREMENT NETWORK TO OBTAIN </p><p>MATERIALS TO BUILD THE RABTA CW PLANT.  THERE WAS A </p><p>CONNECTION BETWEEN A BELGIAN SHIPPING FIRM AND WEST GERMAN </p><p>CHEMICAL MANUFACTURES. </p><p></p><p>END TEXT OF WHITE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
