<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000476 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE FOR WHA/CAN, IIP, INR/IAA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CA, Labor, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT:  MONTREAL ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATORS COALITION OF </p><p>LABOR AND ACTIVIST GROUPS; SIZE OF MARCH 16 </p><p>DEMONSTRATION QUESTIONED </p><p> </p><p>REF:  QUEBEC 00051 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  Quebecers have traditionally been known for anti-war </p><p>sentiment; in the lead-up to the current war in Iraq, polling </p><p>data, media coverage and the largest demonstrations in Canada </p><p>have indicated that pacifism is alive and well in the province. </p><p>But the picture of Quebec pacifism presented in the last several </p><p>months is probably more complicated than a simple outgrowth of a </p><p>historical tradition.  Echec a la guerre, the coalition group </p><p>that has organized all of the large anti-war demonstrations in </p><p>Montreal since January, is comprised primarily of social action </p><p>and labor groups.  Many of these same people and groups were </p><p>active in protesting against globalization at the Quebec City </p><p>Summit of the Americas in 2001.  Interestingly, evidence has come </p><p>to light recently that the size of the Montreal demonstrations, </p><p>which were reported to have drawn participants in the 100,000 to </p><p>200,000 range, may have been considerably exaggerated.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  A Lger Marketing poll conducted March 19-23 is one of many </p><p>highlighting Quebec\'s anti-war views. While Ontarians were </p><p>equally divided as to whether or not the U.S. led coalition is </p><p>justified in declaring war on Iraq (38 percent said yes, 39 </p><p>percent said no), in Quebec those numbers were 82 percent no and </p><p>only 18 percent yes.  The same poll indicates that twice as many </p><p>Quebecers (18 percent) would be inclined to boycott U.S. products </p><p>than Canadians (9 percent). </p><p> </p><p>3.  Quebec journalists who in normal times hold views more </p><p>compatible with anti-globalization and anti-U.S. groups have </p><p>intensified their bias in the past year.  The France-U.S. </p><p>disputes at the UN and the rise of anti-French sentiment in the </p><p>U.S. has only deepened the anti-U.S. slant of the French media in </p><p>Quebec.  Moreover, the presence of France in the dispute has </p><p>increased the percentage of AFP stories and stories taken </p><p>straight from French publications.  La Presse, arguably the most </p><p>important paper in Quebec, dispatched correspondent Jooned Khan </p><p>to Baghdad at the beginning of the war; Kahn is well known for </p><p>his anti-American views and his reporting from Baghdad reflects </p><p>this bias.  He has been regularly contributing first person </p><p>accounts of casualties, especially civilian.  Most of the guests </p><p>on "Maisonneuve  l\'coute," one of the most watched news shows </p><p>in Quebec, are solidly anti-U.S.  Last fall, Maisonneuve hosted a </p><p>Moroccan-born professor, Omar Aktouf, who claimed on the air that </p><p>Ben Laden had nothing to do with 9-11.  Aktouf\'s comments were </p><p>unchallenged by Maisonneuve and the other guest, a French </p><p>h </p><p>philosophy philosopher Pascal Bruckner.  Maisonneuve and RDI, the </p><p>all news network of the French CBC, continue to host French </p><p>authors with strong anti-American views. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The large Montreal demonstrations against the war -- reported </p><p>at 25,000 on January 18, 150,000 on February 15 and 200,000 on </p><p>March 15 -- were organized by an umbrella group called chec  la </p><p>Guerre (Defeat the War).  The Group receives the logistical </p><p>support of the Fdration des Infirmires et Infirmiers du Qubec </p><p>(FIIQ), the Federation of Quebec Nurses.  The FIIQ has a </p><p>membership of 45,500.  (The chec  la Guerre web site is </p><p>actually the FIIQ web site.)  Quebec unions tend to be more </p><p>politicized than their more work place oriented counterparts in </p><p>other Canadian provinces.  They typically have foreign policy </p><p>positions, and their leaders speak out on behalf of international </p><p>groups they see as oppressed (i.e. the Palestinians).  The Nurses </p><p>union, for example, has provided assistance to Cuban </p><p>o Cuban </p><p>organizations and is financing other international projects. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The chec coalition, which assembled 125 groups for its first </p><p>large march on February 15, has grown to over 200 in the past 6 </p><p>weeks.   Most of these groups have small, sometimes overlapping, </p><p>memberships.  But the coalition also includes large, more well- </p><p>known groups like the Federation of Quebec Women, Greenpeace, </p><p>chapters of labor groups such as the Federation des Travailleurs </p><p>du Quebec, and the Muslim Council of Montreal (itself an umbrella </p><p>group of some thirty Montreal Muslim organizations.)  The </p><p>official spokesperson of chec  la guerre is Francine Nmh, who </p><p>is also Director of the Quebec Association of International </p><p>Development Organisations, an umbrella group of 51 organizations </p><p>that work in International Development such as Oxfam-Qubec and </p><p>Mdecins du monde.  Nmh was a delegate at the Summit of the </p><p>People at the Summit of the Americas.  In February, she said that </p><p>aid that </p><p>"this war is illegal and immoral; to participate is to accept the </p><p>premeditated murder of the Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Much has been made of the size of the demonstrations in </p><p>Montreal.  The front page of the tabloid le Journal de Montral </p><p>on March 16 screamed, "Record Crowd for Peace: 200,000 People in </p><p>the Street" (superimposed over a picture of the crowds).  La </p><p>Presse estimated the demonstration at between 100,000 and 200,000 </p><p>but said Montreal\'s showing provided "a lesson of pacific </p><p>solidarity to the rest of the world" where demonstrations on </p><p>March 16 attracted fewer people than a month earlier.  Several TV </p><p>reports said Montreal had one of the largest demonstrations in </p><p>the world.  The huge numbers of people who came out in cold </p><p>weather to protest were quickly seized upon by organizers and </p><p>commentators as indicative of the strength of the Quebec anti-war </p><p>cause.  Bloc Qubcois leader Gilles Duceppe quoted the 250,000 </p><p>number in the House of Commons as proof of strong public anti-war </p><p>ar </p><p>sentiment.  Some said it could be argued that as many as 10 </p><p>percent of Montrealers were demonstrating (greater Montreal\'s </p><p>population is approximately 2.5 million people). </p><p> </p><p>7.  However, on Sunday (4/6), Jean-Franois Grenier, President of </p><p>GeoCom, a site locator company in Montreal, suggested to viewers </p><p>of the French CBC 5 sur 5 show that the numbers of protestors on </p><p>March 16 were not more than 49,000.  He indicated to post on the </p><p>phone that 49,000 was a generous interpretation of aerial photos </p><p>his company had taken of the crowds (leaving open the possibility </p><p>that some thousands of people had left the protest when the </p><p>photos were taken).  Grenier told us he thought the actual </p><p>figure, as indicated by the density of the crowds measured in his </p><p>photos, was likely between 35,000 and 40,000.  Geocom made a </p><p>crowd density assessment for the demonstrations on March 14 at </p><p>the request of French CBC.  Grenier indicated he thought the </p><p>numbers cited by both the media, demonstration organizers and </p><p>even the police were way off.  (Grenier also questioned the size </p><p>of demonstrations reported in Europe.)  None of the Monday (4/5) </p><p>papers mentioned the strong possibility that the March 16 crowds </p><p>had been overestimated nor did CBC French television do much to </p><p>publicize its new-found information. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  Regardless of the number of people who attended the </p><p>peace marches, Quebecers do oppose the war to a greater extent </p><p>than other Canadians. But because that opposition is greatest </p><p>among the media and militant anti-globalization groups, </p><p>perceptions may be skewed.  The present anti-war sentiment is </p><p>widespread in Quebec but we suspect that among the general </p><p>population, this sentiment does not run as deep as the media and </p><p>certain politicians have presented it. </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
