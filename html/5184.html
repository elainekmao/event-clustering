ANKARA 302 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 201 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by POL-MIL Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Pol-Mil Counselor spoke with MFA DDG/Mideast Safak </p><p>Gokturk 1/17 about Turkey\'s plans for a "peace" summit of </p><p>heads of state or government of Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, </p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Gokturk confirmed that FM Yakis had </p><p>called in ambassadors/charges from the five other countries </p><p>1/16 and proposed the summit for 1/23 in Istanbul.  They are </p><p>awaiting responses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Regarding any declaration the summit would produce, </p><p>Gokturk says Turkey will push for a clear message to the </p><p>Iraqi leadership.  Turkey also wants it to say that the six </p><p>are "no enemy of the Iraqi nation, only its leadership." </p><p>Turkey wants the declaration to refer to the need for further </p><p>UNSC discussion.  Ankara wants the summit to be </p><p>"complementary to efforts of the Security Council."  It </p><p>should not be diluted by any attempts to "balance" the </p><p>language with criticism of the US.  This is not a "balancing </p><p>act," Gokturk said, a point Gokturk said Yakis had also made </p><p>to the Arab and Iranian Chiefs of Mission.  That said, </p><p>Gokturk admitted that other participants would obviously try </p><p>to influence the declaration and that the final product would </p><p>inevitably be the "weakest common denominator" of the six </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Regarding the "game plan":  Turkey realized the summit </p><p>was short notice, but Ankara sees the need to act swiftly </p><p>("we can\'t wait until March").  Turkish embassies in the five </p><p>capitals are double-tracking the invitations.  Finally, </p><p>Gokturk promised to remain in constant consultation with the </p><p>Embassy on the summit.  "We will keep you posted." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
