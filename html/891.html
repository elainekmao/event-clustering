RASE, REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SULTAN BOLKIAH EXPRESSED HIS DEEP </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. DEFENSE UMBRELLA IN </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIA, CHARACTERIZING IT AS ESSENTIAL </p><p>TO THE REGION\'S PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  HE ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE BROADER </p><p>U.S.-BRUNEI BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  ADMIRAL </p><p>NATTER EXPLAINED THE USG\'S CURRENT DEFENSE </p><p>PROFILE IN ASIA AND EXCHANGED VIEWS ON HOW TO </p><p>IMPROVE SECURITY RELATIONS WITH CHINA.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, SULTAN </p><p>BOLKIAH COMMENTED ON THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS </p><p>THAT EXIST BETWEEN BRUNEI AND THE U.S.  HE WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY PLEASED BY THE GROWING </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY TIES.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT </p><p>HE HAS ALWAYS VIEWED THE U.S. PRESENCE IN </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIA AS ESSENTIAL TO THE REGION\'S </p><p>PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  HE SAID THAT HE WELCOMES </p><p>OUR ROLE IN ASIA AND WAS CERTAIN THAT SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIA\'S OTHER LEADERS SHARE THIS VIEW, IF NOT </p><p>ALWAYS PUBLICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ADMIRAL NATTER SAID THAT THE USG WELCOMES </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY TO COOPERATE WITH BRUNEI\'S ARMED </p><p>FORCES AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATES BRUNEI\'S OPEN </p><p>EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. PRESENCE IN </p><p>ASIA.  HE NOTED BY WAY OF EXAMPLE OF THE U.S. </p><p>ROLE THAT U.S. NAVY AND MARINES ARE PREPARED FOR </p><p>ACTION IN CAMBODIA TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS </p><p>AND TO ASSIST IN EVACUATION IF THAT BECOMES A </p><p>NECESSITY.  THE ADMIRAL ADDED THAT THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>CRISIS NOW SEEMS TO BE OVER AND WE HAVE HAD NO </p><p>NEED TO CALL ON THE NAVY AND MARINES.  BUT THEY </p><p>ARE READY IF NEEDED.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT HE </p><p>VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE USG\'S QUICK RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE RECENT EVENTS IN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ADMIRAL NATTER COMMENTED THAT HIS PRIORITY </p><p>AREA OF CONCERN IS MONITORING EVENTS IN NORTH </p><p>KOREA.  HOWEVER, CHINA REMAINS THE ISSUE OF </p><p>LONG-TERM CONCERN.  THE ADMIRAL SAID THE USG </p><p>GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN OUR STRENGTH IN ASIA WHILE </p><p>BUILDING CLOSER, MORE COOPERATIVE TIES WITH </p><p>CHINA.  CHINA REMAINS SUSPICIOUS OF THE U.S. </p><p>MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN AND SEEMS </p><p>UNWILLING TO BELIEVE THAT OUR AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>JAPAN LIMIT THEIR NEED TO BUILD AND PROJECT </p><p>GREATER MILITARY STRENGTH -- SOMETHING CHINA </p><p>WOULD NOT WELCOME.  HE ASKED FOR THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>VIEWS ON HOW TO WORK WITH CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT CHINA IS HEAVILY </p><p>FOCUSED ON DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>WANTS NOTHING TO INTERFERE WITH GROWTH.  THEY </p><p>SEE ANY STRONG MILITARY IN THE REGION AS A </p><p>POTENTIAL THREAT THAT HAS TO BE COUNTERED.  HE </p><p>FELT THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH CHINA\'S </p><p>LEADERS IS THROUGH CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT.  IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA THAT THE U.S. AND </p><p>CHINA (AND JAPAN) WORK TOWARDS MUTUAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING.  THE SULTAN ARGUED THAT AS CHINA </p><p>GROWS ECONOMICALLY, IT WILL HAVE A GREATER </p><p>INTEREST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\'S STABILITY? </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN CLOSING, ADMIRAL NATTER INVITED THE </p><p>SULTAN TO VISIT ONE OF TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS </p><p>THAT WILL BE IN THE REGION OVER THE NEXT TWO </p><p>MONTHS.  SULTAN BOLKIAH SAID HE WOULD BE </p><p>DELIGHTED IF THE TIMING CAN BE WORKED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE U.S. ATTENDEES FOR THE MEETING WERE VICE </p><p>ADMIRAL NATTER, AMBASSADOR RASE AND COMMANDER </p><p>PORTER.  THE SULTAN WAS SUPPORTED BY HIS </p><p>MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, PEHIN ISA (WHO </p><p>TRANSLATED FOR THE SULTAN), ACTING ROYAL BRUNEI </p><p>ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, GENERAL ABIDIN, AND THE </p><p>PERM SEC FOR POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION, PEHIN </p><p>ABDUL RAHMAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RASE </p><p></p></div>
