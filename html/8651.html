<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, DRL, EB/IFD </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>STATE PASS USAID </p><p>STATE PASS EXIM/OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2005 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, KDEM, PHUM, PREL, SENV, SOCI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTING ZIMBABWE AFTER DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1130 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Econchief William Weissman.  Reason: 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) Summary: This message provides recommendations for </p><p>U.S. assistance to a reformist, democratically-elected </p><p>government.  These recommendations go well beyond the </p><p>assistance we recommended for a transition government in </p><p>reftel. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) Reftel outlined programs and activities we think </p><p>should be put in place quickly if a genuinely reformist </p><p>transition government takes office.  We also highlighted </p><p>obstacles to be cleared before offering assistance during the </p><p>transition.  Today\'s message takes the process a step </p><p>further, providing a more complete list of assistance </p><p>programs and activities to help consolidate a democratic </p><p>government committed to reform.  We envision that most </p><p>programs would be implemented only after a </p><p>democratically-elected government takes office, but believe </p><p>this supplemental list might also become important for </p><p>planning purposes during the transition phase.  Moreover, it </p><p>is useful for the USG to begin to consider what will be </p><p>required during the entire democratic and economic </p><p>reconstruction process. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) Key elements of the supplementary programs and </p><p>activities include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Democracy </p><p>o Seek presidential finding on Zimbabwe return to </p><p>rule-of-law/democracy </p><p>o Increase funding for parliamentary spending ($1 million) </p><p>o Seek appropriation of Zimbabwe Democracy Act (ZDERA) </p><p>authorized funds to rebuild democratic institutions ($5 </p><p>million) </p><p>o Fund church and civil society dialogue and reconciliation </p><p>programs ($3 million) </p><p>o Provide judicial training, including arbitration and </p><p>mediation ($2.5 million/yr) </p><p>o Expand current pilot programs for local governance </p><p>nationwide ($2.5 million/yr) </p><p>o Continue civil society strengthening ($2 million/yr) </p><p> </p><p>-- Humanitarian/Agriculture/Land Reform </p><p>o Expand food assistance, shifting to food-for-work and/or </p><p>food-for-peace as market conditions permit.

(c) Comment: Until the mid-1990s, Zimbabwe was Sub-Sahara </p><p>Africa\'s second most industrial country (after the Republic </p><p>of South Africa).  Since then, it has become one of the </p><p>poorest nation by many measures, a textbook case of </p><p>misgovernance and its consequences.  We broker no illusions </p><p>that Zimbabwe can rapidly regain past prowess.  However, we </p><p>believe the country -- with abundant mineral resources, </p><p>arable land, high-end tourist destinations and manufacturing </p><p>know-how -- still holds great potential.  Through the </p><p>programs and activities outlined above, the U.S. could help </p><p>Zimbabwe reemerge one day as an important regional player. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
