<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-18-13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, PARM, CE, JA, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sixth round of GSL-LTTE talks reportedly gets </p><p>off to better-than-expected start </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 03-17-03 telecon </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 450, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The Tigers used the first day of the </p><p>sixth round of talks in Japan to condemn the March 10 </p><p>sinking of one of their resupply ships by the Sri Lankan </p><p>navy.  Milinda Moragoda, a key GSL minister and </p><p>negotiator, called the Ambassador from Japan and said </p><p>atmospherics for the first day were largely positive. </p><p>Moragoda conveyed a Tiger request to participate in the </p><p>April 14 donor meeting in Washington.  There was another </p><p>incident off the northeast coast on March 17, but it has </p><p>been resolved.  The talks seem to have gotten off to a </p><p>better-than-expected start.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Mission understands that the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) used the first day of the sixth round </p><p>of talks in Japan to complain about the March 10 sinking </p><p>of one of its resupply ships by the Sri Lankan navy. </p><p>(Note:  The talks are taking place in Hakone, a resort </p><p>town outside of Tokyo, from March 18-21.  See Ref B, for </p><p>further details re the March 10 incident.)  In March 18 </p><p>and 19 telephone conversations, Milinda Moragoda, the </p><p>GSL Minister of Economic Reform and a key GSL </p><p>negotiator, told the Ambassador that the talks had been </p><p>largely cordial in spite of the Tigers\' complaints re </p><p>the March 10 incident.  Moragoda noted that the GSL had </p><p>acceded to a LTTE request that Sea Tiger Leader Soosai </p><p>meet with Sri Lanka Navy Commander D. Sandagiri.  After </p><p>some discussion, it was agreed that the meeting would </p><p>take place within the next three weeks.  Moragoda\'s </p><p>overall impression was that the talks were proceeding </p><p>well and that the LTTE did not want to disrupt the peace </p><p>process over the March 10 incident, but simply register </p><p>its concern. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Moragoda noted to the Ambassador that on March 19 </p><p>he had been approached by chief LTTE negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham and asked whether the LTTE could be </p><p>represented at the April 14 donor\'s meeting in </p><p>Washington.  Balasingham stressed that the Tigers have </p><p>shown their commitment to peace and should thus be </p><p>permitted to be represented at the conference.  The </p><p>Ambassador responded that Balasingham\'s comments had </p><p>been noted, but the answer is a firm "no." (Note:  Re </p><p>this issue, Mission is faxing SA/INS a letter from </p><p>Jeevan Thiagarajah, the head of the Consortium of </p><p>Humanitarian Agencies, a local NGO, advocating that the </p><p>LTTE-controlled Tamil Rehabilitation Organization be </p><p>allowed to attend the April 14 conference.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Moragoda also told the Ambassador that the </p><p>delegations in Hakone were currently discussing possible </p><p>means of implementing development assistance.  Along </p><p>those lines, the LTTE expressed concern that the U.S. </p><p>planned to oppose the North/East Rehabilitation Fund </p><p>(NERF) as a means of coordinating aid going into LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas.  The Ambassador noted to Moragoda that </p><p>although the USG would not work through the NERF, it </p><p>would not oppose NERF\'s use by other donors.  The </p><p>Ambassador added that the USG would find a way to keep </p><p>the NERF informed of its bilateral assistance efforts. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) (((Note:  On a separate issue, Moragoda related </p><p>to the Ambassador that Balasingham had mentioned to him </p><p>recent press reports that the U.S. planned to provide </p><p>the GSL an old U.S. Coast Guard cutter.  Balasingham did </p><p>not complain about the reported procurement, but seemed </p><p>to want Moragoda to know that the LTTE had noticed the </p><p>reports.  Based on Balasingham\'s reaction, Moragoda told </p><p>the Ambassador that the LTTE was signaling "message </p><p>received."  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Local observers were encouraged that the talks </p><p>seem to be going relatively well despite the recent </p><p>tensions sparked by the March 10 incident.  Kethesh </p><p>Loganathan of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a </p><p>well-regarded local think tank, commented that he was </p><p>pleasantly surprised that the Tigers seemed to want the </p><p>talks to be constructive in nature.  Like other </p><p>observers, he said he had feared the group would use the </p><p>talks simply to hit out at the GSL over the March 10 </p><p>incident and on other issues.  He also characterized as </p><p>"amazingly positive" Balasingham\'s reported comments to </p><p>the press that the LTTE would "never walk out of the </p><p>peace process." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In the meantime, as reported in Ref A, there was </p><p>another incident off the northeast coast on March 17, </p><p>but it has been resolved.  According to GSL reports, </p><p>navy ships spotted a LTTE craft off the coast of </p><p>Trincomalee on March 17 and asked the boat to stop, but </p><p>it would not.  After firing warning shots, the boat did </p><p>stop and the three LTTE cadre on board surrendered.  The </p><p>navy took the men on shore, but later released them. </p><p>Apparently, despite the navy\'s initial fears, no arms- </p><p>related equipment was found on the boat, although the </p><p>navy wonders whether the LTTE cadre dumped cargo during </p><p>the chase.  The Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission is looking into what transpired, but has told us </p><p>that the incident does not seem to have led to any </p><p>increase in tension between the two sides. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Because of the March 10 incident, </p><p>there had been widespread concerns that the Hakone talks </p><p>would be contentious.  Based on what we are hearing, </p><p>however, the talks seem to have gotten off to a better- </p><p>than-expected start.  Moreover, Balasingham seems to be </p><p>trying his level best to give off good vibrations in his </p><p>interactions with the press.  In our estimation, while </p><p>it is still early, the Tigers appear to want to make </p><p>this round of talks work out in a positive fashion.  If </p><p>the Tigers continue to behave, that would help the </p><p>government, which has been under sharp pressure from </p><p>anti-peace process elements of late.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
