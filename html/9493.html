Bush - during their meeting </p><p>in Pretoria - that Robert Mugabe would step down in </p><p>December.  Mbeki\'s denial has made headlines in the local </p><p>press.  The July 18 edition of the government-controlled </p><p>daily "The Herald" published a wire article by Agence </p><p>France Presse as its lead story, under headline "Mbeki </p><p>denies report: `There was no discussion at all about </p><p>anybody stepping down.\'"  The independent daily "The Daily </p><p>News" (07/18) relegated the same story to page 3.  Reacting </p><p>to reports in Britain\'s Independent newspaper that he </p><p>(President Mbeki) and President Bush had discussed Mugabe\'s </p><p>exit during President Bush\'s whistle-stop visit of Africa </p><p>last week, SAPA news agency quotes, President Mbeki as </p><p>having told reporters at a briefing in Pretoria: "There is </p><p>no such thing.  I don\'t know where that comes </p><p>from. . .There was no discussion at all about anybody </p><p>stepping down."  A weekend report in Britain\'s Independent </p><p>newspaper, by Zimbabwean journalist Basildon Peta, also </p><p>said Mugabe\'s stepping down as leader of ZANU PF could pave </p><p>the way for "his exit and fresh elections in 2004." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
