<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005908 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM ABUL RAGHEB TELLS DAS CHENEY GOJ WORKING ON </p><p>LEGAL REVISION TO HELP STOP HONOR KILLINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>PM:  "WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  NEA DAS Elizabeth Cheney met October 8 with Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb to discuss economic, political, and </p><p>educational reform issues (septel).  Ambassador Gnehm, USAID </p><p>Director, and PolCouns accompanied.  Planning Minister Bassam </p><p>Awadallah and PM\'s Media Advisor Natasha Bukhari sat in on </p><p>the Jordanian side.  Following discussion of Jordan\'s </p><p>economic reform program, Cheney expressed to the PM continued </p><p>USG concern about the practice of honor killings in Jordan. </p><p>In particular, she noted that Jordan has the potential to </p><p>become a model for the region in terms of development, but </p><p>that continued tolerance of the practice of honor killings </p><p>stands in the way.  Cheney noted strong USG concern with </p><p>Article 340 of the Jordanian criminal code which permits </p><p>honor killings, and Article 98, which is often used to reduce </p><p>sentences for perpetrators of these crimes. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Abul Ragheb responded that many outside Jordan have </p><p>misinterpreted honor killings.  "Islam is against it; it </p><p>comes out of tradition."  He said there is also confusion </p><p>about the two sections of Jordanian law that deal with </p><p>punishment for honor crimes.  Article 340, most often cited </p><p>as the "honor crimes law," actually deals with "crimes of </p><p>passion" and can only be applied if a husband catches a wife </p><p>in the act of infidelity and kills her or her lover on the </p><p>spot.  Abul Ragheb claimed that this law had only been </p><p>applied three times, given the specificity of the exception. </p><p>He said the GOJ has already amended this law to make it </p><p>gender non-specific (i.e. spouse versus husband or wife). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>MINIMUM SENTENCE FOR ALL MURDER CONVICTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The real issue of concern, he continued, was the </p><p>broader Article 98, which instructs judges to take into </p><p>account the circumstances of murders in handing out </p><p>punishment.  Judges in Jordan have traditionally used Article </p><p>98 to reduce sentences as part of mediation efforts between </p><p>families or tribes to prevent the start of a feud.  They have </p><p>also used this clause to reduce sentences in honor killing </p><p>cases when the family of the perpetrator (which is usually </p><p>also the family of the victim) asks for leniency so the </p><p>guilty male relative can continue to support his family.  The </p><p>GOJ, he said, realizes that, in many cases, a man will kill a </p><p>female relative for another reason and say he was moved to </p><p>kill her to protect the family honor.  Abul Ragheb said the </p><p>GOJ wants to institute a minimum sentence for all persons </p><p>convicted of any kind of murder (he mentioned 7 and 5 years </p><p>as possibilities).  This would ensure that those who claimed </p><p>to have killed in the name of honor would not receive token </p><p>sentences.  If the government makes this amendment to Article </p><p>98 and honor killers receive "serious sentences, they won\'t </p><p>do it any more."  "We are serious about doing something about </p><p>this." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DAS Cheney noted the importance of a strong public </p><p>message from the GOJ condemning the practice of honor </p><p>killings.  She asked if the GOJ would also consider a public </p><p>information campaign on honor killings, and offered USG </p><p>assistance for such an effort.  Abul Ragheb said that the </p><p>subject of honor killings had been taboo until 4 years ago, </p><p>when the government and Royal family had begun a significant </p><p>information campaign against honor killings.  However, in </p><p>2000 when the GOJ had tried to amend Article 340, Parliament </p><p>soundly defeated the GOJ\'s proposal.  Parliamentarians voted </p><p>against the law, he said, either to "save tradition" or </p><p>"ensure law and order."  Cheney reiterated the potential </p><p>importance of such a campaign, and noted that the USG would </p><p>like to provide support to end the practice. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>GOJ SUPPORTS ARAB HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  DAS Cheney had also discussed honor killings in an </p><p>October 7 meeting with Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher (other </p><p>topics reported septel).  DAS Cheney told Muasher the U.S. </p><p>stood ready to assist the GOJ in addressing this problem, </p><p>noting that changes here could have wider implications </p><p>regionally given Jordan\'s potential role as a model on a host </p><p>of reform issues. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Muasher said the GOJ is working to address this </p><p>"convoluted notion of honor that is deeply rooted in a </p><p>socially conservative society."  Muasher said that </p><p>he is personally doing all he can "to give a signal </p><p>that these things will not be tolerated."  As an </p><p>example, he outlined the steps he has taken since becoming </p><p>Foreign Minister to eliminate discrimination against </p><p>women in the diplomatic corps, including providing equal </p><p>benefits and allowances for spouses and children of all </p><p>diplomats, regardless of the gender of the officer (ref). </p><p>DAS Cheney commended these efforts, and noted that there </p><p>are broad issues of women\'s empowerment that require </p><p>near and long term strategies to address.  The issue of </p><p>honor killings, however, is different and requires an </p><p>immediate resolution. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  As the meeting concluded both DAS Cheney and </p><p>Muasher agreed that the problem of gender discrimination </p><p>is an important issue the Arab world must address, </p><p>and that the recently issued UN Arab Human Development </p><p>Report (AHDR) provides concrete suggestions for policy </p><p>reforms to address gender equality issues.  Muasher </p><p>observed that Jordan is "the only Arab country that has </p><p>fully endorsed" the report.  The GOJ, he said, will </p><p>continue to take a "very proactive role" in inter-Arab </p><p>deliberations on these issues.  DAS Cheney told Muasher </p><p>that Jordan should consider the U.S. a partner in this </p><p>regard. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ACTIVIST DISCUSSES HONOR KILLINGS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  April Palmerlee, Senior Coordinator for </p><p>International Women\'s issues, also raised the issue of </p><p>honor killings during her meetings with GOJ officials and </p><p>NGOs. Nancy Bakir, Human Rights Advisor to the Prime </p><p>Minister, agreed with Palmerlee that honor killings are a </p><p>serious matter but noted that societal attitudes are </p><p>improving, and that the Jordanian media now regularly </p><p>report on honor killings.  In a subsequent meeting with </p><p>human rights activist Sa\'eda Kilani, Kilani said that </p><p>people had become confused between laws with regard to </p><p>honor killings and "crimes of passion," and that, in </p><p>her opinion, the GOJ should do more to clarify the </p><p>differences.  Kilani said that the fact that any </p><p>woman has to live in fear of being killed by her </p><p>husband or close family member is tragic, and noted </p><p>efforts of Royal Family members (in particular Prince Ali) </p><p>to address the issue.  "The Royal Court, in general, </p><p>is quite supportive of women\'s rights," Kilani said. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Abul Ragheb\'s comments and pledge to amend </p><p>Article 98 are the most positive statements from the </p><p>GOJ on honor killings since the failed attempt </p><p>to repeal Section 340 in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  DAS Cheney has cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
