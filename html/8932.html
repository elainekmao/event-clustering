<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTIONS ON CAFTA, JUNE 23, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Moises Starkman in Tegucigalpa-based moderate </p><p>daily "El Heraldo" on 6/23 entitled "CAFTA opportunities". </p><p>"The conflicts that the CAFTA negotiations have faced show, </p><p>once again, that we as Central Americans have not learned to </p><p>work taking into account our common regional interests." </p><p> </p><p>"Unfortunately, CAFTA does not expect to solve the problems </p><p>that the Central American integration process has </p><p>experienced for so many years. we should not waste the </p><p>opportunity to sign CAFTA and promote through it higher </p><p>levels of investment, production, exports and employment in </p><p>the region, as well as access to better and cheaper </p><p>products." </p><p> </p><p>"We are confident that the Honduran delegation will be able </p><p>to defend the national interests during these negotiations. </p><p>We are optimistic that they will listen to the proposals and </p><p>suggestions from the private sector, workers and consumers, </p><p>who should be the basis of this agreement." </p><p> </p><p>2. Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "La </p><p>Prensa" on 6/23 entitled "The failures of CAFTA". "The facts </p><p>are more eloquent than words and they show that the Fifth </p><p>round of CAFTA negotiations carried out in Tegucigalpa were </p><p>a complete failure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"One of the factors that caused this fiasco was the lack of </p><p>vision of the U.S. lead negotiator Regina Vargo, or perhaps </p><p>of her superiors, that led to an absurd offer from </p><p>Washington to act as if the Generalized System of </p><p>Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Initiative do not exist, </p><p>proposing that trade with the U.S. should start from scratch </p><p>which could mean a step back for Central America in certain </p><p>productive areas, such as textile production." </p><p> </p><p>"To go forward, it is crucial to find out what Washington </p><p>wants from this negotiation, to offer the U.S. something </p><p>they are interested in, and put an end to the stagnation of </p><p>the process." </p><p> </p><p>3. Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "Tiempo" </p><p>on 6/23 entitled "Fifth Round of CAFTA negotiations". "These </p><p>negotiations should not only be limited to trade, CAFTA </p><p>should become a mechanism to solve the basic problems of the </p><p>relationship between Central America and the U.S." </p><p> </p><p>". CAFTA should help to create a value-added production zone </p><p>and employment in Central America to prevent the current </p><p>massive flows of illegal migration to the U.S. Furthermore, </p><p>it ought to eliminate the socio-economic problems that </p><p>favors other unlawful activities such as narco trafficking, </p><p>terrorism and organized crime." </p><p> </p><p>4. Article in "La Tribuna" on 6/23 entitled "The U.S. wants </p><p>to make a double play". According to Medardo Galindo, </p><p>president of the Federation of Agricultural Exporters of </p><p>Honduras, many Honduran products would be exported to the </p><p>U.S. tax-free since they are included in the Caribbean Basin </p><p>Initiative, but if CAFTA was approved as it is now, they </p><p>would be paying taxes in a range of 11 to 29 percent. </p><p> </p><p>5. Article in "La Tribuna" on 6/23 entitled "CAFTA proposals </p><p>were unrealistic". The Honduran congressman and private </p><p>entrepreneur Gilberto Goldstein stated, "We\'re like small </p><p>fish facing a shark. An agreement was trying to be signed </p><p>when the region is not even united, making any proposal </p><p>unattainable. My suggestion is that the Central American </p><p>presidents find a form of unity within the isthmus in order </p><p>to deal with the first and biggest economy of the world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. On 6/23 "La Tribuna" featured an article entitled </p><p>"Chicken in pounds". "During the fifth Round of CAFTA </p><p>negotiations, there were discussions on the possibility of </p><p>exporting and importing chicken breasts and legs between the </p><p>US and the region. The trading of chicken parts would fall </p><p>under the `sensitive\' category, along with fruits, grains, </p><p>pork and beef." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
