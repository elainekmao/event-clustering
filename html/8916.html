<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BRUSSELS 003231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EUN, USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>SUBJECT: EU PARLIAMENT U.S. RELATIONS RESOLUTION MIXED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: USEU POLOFF TODD HUIZINGA, </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On June 19 the European Parliament (EP) </p><p>passed a resolution on "A Renewed Transatlantic Relationship </p><p>for the Third Millenium."  Foreign Relations Committee Chair </p><p>Elmar Brok, a German Christian Democrat and strong advocate </p><p>of close transatlantic ties, drafted the resolution and timed </p><p>it to appear on the eve of the June 25 U.S.-EU summit.  The </p><p>intent was constructively to point the way to renewed U.S.-EU </p><p>ties, and most MEP\'s believe (or would want to believe) the </p><p>resolution did that.  Despite the positive intent, however, </p><p>the final resolution is replete with passages chiding the </p><p>U.S. for its stances on the International Criminal Court, the </p><p>Kyoto Protocol, the death penalty, etc.  For the majority of </p><p>MEPs, the desire to assert a European voice on these </p><p>hot-button issues, especially after Iraq, remains strong.  In </p><p>that context, the fact that the strongest pro-Americans in </p><p>the EP voted against the resolution only served to illustrate </p><p>their isolation.  On a positive note, the EP resolution did </p><p>affirm the importance of good U.S.-EU relations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>The Saga of a Resolution: </p><p>From A Call for a New Start to </p><p>a Model of Ambivalence </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We first learned in early May that the resolution was </p><p>under consideration and that the drafter was British </p><p>Conservative MEP James Elles, the Foreign Affairs Committee\'s </p><p>Rapporteur on relations with the U.S.  Elles responded </p><p>positively to our suggestion that a resolution expressing </p><p>goodwill towards the U.S. in the wake of tensions over Iraq </p><p>provided an opportunity for the EP to be noticed and </p><p>appreciated. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the basis of this discussion with Elles and the </p><p>office of EP President Pat Cox, we engaged to see if the EP, </p><p>or Pat Cox himself, could make some kind of additional </p><p>statement about how the U.S.-EU relationship could move </p><p>forward again.  Cox was interested in having such a statement </p><p>in hand to present in the run-up to the June 25 U.S.-EU </p><p>Summit.  Despite the intentions of our EP interlocutors, </p><p>however, the efforts of the EP leaders got caught in the </p><p>prevailing ambivalence of most MEPs towards the U.S.  First, </p><p>the resolution was not ready to be passed by early June.  In </p><p>May, drafting responsibility shifted from Elles to Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee Chairman Brok, and the new target date </p><p>became approval in Committee on June 11 followed by final </p><p>approval in plenary on June 19.  Second and more importantly, </p><p>the resolution changed into a lengthy laundry list of </p><p>complaints about the U.S. instead of the originally desired </p><p>gesture of good will. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>The Resolution Itself: </p><p>A Mixture of the </p><p>Good and the Bad </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) After the usual series of clauses referring to earlier </p><p>declarations, treaty articles and the like, the resolution </p><p>begins with solid affirmations of the importance and salutary </p><p>effects of strong transatlantic ties, such as:  "reaffirming </p><p>(the European Parliament\'s) commitment to the democratic </p><p>values which are the foundation of...the transatlantic </p><p>community;" "balanced EU-US relations are important to global </p><p>peace and stability;"  "stressing...the positive results </p><p>achieved in the field of external relations when a common </p><p>approach...(is) developed;"  "in economic terms, Europe and </p><p>the USA are the two most closely bound regions in the world;" </p><p> "by acting together Europe and the United States could </p><p>develop solutions to global challenges;" and many similar </p><p>passages. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The resolution goes on to advocate the creation of </p><p>additional structures to underpin U.S.-EU dialogue, and to </p><p>assert that a stronger EU is essential to progress in </p><p>transatlantic relations.  Some of the relevant passages </p><p>include:  "whereas the EU and the USA have treaties and </p><p>agreements with almost every State in the world, but not with </p><p>each other; whereas a new common framework could be created </p><p>in economic and trade policy...;"  "whereas greater </p><p>involvement of legislators on both sides of the Atlantic is a </p><p>fundamental prerequisite for enhancing the whole </p><p>transatlantic process;"  "stresses that the EU will only be </p><p>recognized as a partner if (it has) a real CFSP and that this </p><p>requires the extension of qualified majority voting in the </p><p>Council to...the field of the Foreign and Security Policy, </p><p>the establishment of a European common diplomatic service, </p><p>enhanced cooperation in defense policy...;" "underlines that </p><p>EU-USA relations need a project aimed at enhancing...the </p><p>partnership and that a...EU-US Framework Treaty...could be </p><p>such a project;"  "underlines...that the existing </p><p>interparliamentary exchange should be gradually transformed </p><p>into a de facto \'Transatlantic Assembly\'". </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) However, there are numerous clauses chiding the U.S. </p><p>for not agreeing with the majority of the EP on a panoply of </p><p>issues, including the death penalty, GMO\'s, international </p><p>instruments on the rights of the child, and "safeguarding the </p><p>treatment of prisoners of war in the wake of the recent </p><p>conflicts."   One clause implicitly makes U.S. agreement with </p><p>the EU on the Kyoto Protocol and the ICC a pre-condition of </p><p>better transatlantic relations: "responding along the same </p><p>lines to...global warming (i.e., by ratifying and </p><p>implementing the minimum standards f the Kyoto Protocol) and </p><p>that of global justice (i.e. the functioning of the </p><p>International Criminal Court)...must become a priority in the </p><p>reinforcement of transatlantic relations."  The resolution </p><p>also contains a rather verbose swipe at American </p><p>neo-conservatives:  "(The EP) expresses concerns that the </p><p>EU-US partnership could be undermined...by the apparently </p><p>growing influence of those neo-conservative currents in US </p><p>politics which emphasize unilateral, and often military, </p><p>solutions to global problems at the expense of the traditions </p><p>of more than 50 years of US internationalism and </p><p>multilateralism...." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Strong Support from Conservatives, </p><p>Liberals, Socialists </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The resolution was passed by a vote of 303 in favor, </p><p>109 against and 47 abstentions.  A roll-call of the vote was </p><p>not published, but we confirmed that among those voting in </p><p>favor were large majorities of the Social Democrats (PSE), of </p><p>the Liberal Democrats (ELDR)and of the European People\'s </p><p>Party (EPP--Christian Democrats and Conservatives), except </p><p>the British Conservatives. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>MEPs and Staffers:  Goodwill </p><p>Should Not Silence Critique </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Jacques Lecarte, ELDR Foreign Affairs staffer, told </p><p>us that the consensus among both ELDR and PSE MEP\'s was that </p><p>the resolution was a balanced mix of statements on the </p><p>strengths and importance of the relationship with the U.S. </p><p>and an honest assessment of the problems in the relationship. </p><p> The EPP view was similar, he said.  In response to our </p><p>observation that the British Conservative group within the </p><p>EPP voted against it, Lecarte laughed and said, "as always." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) German PSE MEP Erika Mann told us during preparation </p><p>of the resolution that she, as an Atlanticist Social </p><p>Democrat, was against tabling the resolution.  She predicted </p><p>that it would contain significant anti-U.S. content.  After </p><p>the final vote, Mann\'s staffer told us that Mann\'s concern </p><p>had been validated -- that the resolution contained too much </p><p>critique of the U.S. to be understood in the U.S. as the </p><p>goodwill gesture that many in the EP want it to be. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ELDR Secretary-General Alexander Beels told us that </p><p>the ICC "had to be in there" because of European anger at </p><p>American pressure on EU accession states to sign Article 98 </p><p>agreements and thereby undermine the ICC.  Carlo Chicco, the </p><p>head staffer of the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, </p><p>averred that "American arrogance," such as in "threatening to </p><p>move NATO out of Belgium" because of the Belgian Universal </p><p>Competence law, rendered it impossible for MEPs representing </p><p>angry European citizens to refrain from critical comments on </p><p>America\'s rejection of the ICC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>The Strongest Pro-Americans </p><p>Voted Against </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The generally most fervent Atlanticists in the EP, </p><p>the British Conservatives and the Dutch Calvinist Alliance </p><p>(VU), voted against the resolution as not positive enough </p><p>towards the United States. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Vice-Chairman of the EP Subcommittee on the U.S., Bas </p><p>Belder of the VU, and British Conservative Geoffrey Van Orden </p><p>together tabled amendments striking all of the language </p><p>critical of the U.S.  All of these amendments were rejected </p><p>overwhelmingly in the Foreign Affairs Committee.  After </p><p>talking with us, Belder had made a plea in a plenary session </p><p>on June 4 that renewing transatlantic relations would require </p><p>that Europeans approach the U.S. with an attitude of trust </p><p>rather than suspicion.  He added that the resolution should </p><p>not include a laundry list of European complaints that would </p><p>cloud the message of friendship towards the U.S. </p><p>13. (U) British Conservative MEP Charles Tannock sent us the </p><p>Explanation of Vote he had drafted for his party group.  It </p><p>declares that, despite the "good in this resolution - a </p><p>commitment to act together to develop common solutions to </p><p>global problems...", the British Conservatives are forced to </p><p>vote against the resolution because of references which are </p><p>not helpful to good relations.  The language following is </p><p>specific on unilateralism and the ICC and a ringing </p><p>condemnation of anti-Americanism in Europe:  "There is (in </p><p>the resolution) a reference to unilateral approaches to </p><p>problems that is offensive and which ignores the pre-eminent </p><p>role which the United States as the world\'s largest and most </p><p>powerful country must inevitably play if the values to which </p><p>we subscribe are to be upheld.  The insistence that the U.S. </p><p>share Europe\'s view on the ICC is also made plain - despite </p><p>the problems that an unamended statute would cause for the </p><p>U.S. at present.  We cannot expect the Americans to be </p><p>multilateralist and engaged in the world and to risk </p><p>malicious prosecution of their civilian and political leaders </p><p>in the way that Europe requires.  Equally there is no need </p><p>for Europe continually to seek disagreement with the U.S. </p><p>over the death penalty which remains legal in international </p><p>law.  We need to respect their difference of opinion, not </p><p>attempt to raise it as a symbol of European moral superiority </p><p>over the U.S.  We need to co-operate together, not brandish </p><p>sticks.  There has been too much anti-Americanism in Europe </p><p>recently and Europe needs to remember what it owes to </p><p>America." </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Comment: The EP resolution is not a surprise.  It </p><p>reflects the current disposition in Brussels (and Strasbourg, </p><p>where the EP holds its monthly sessions) to take America to </p><p>task for disagreeing with Europe on the hot-button issues </p><p>such as the ICC and global warming. Most disheartening is </p><p>that, even while attempting to send a positive signal and </p><p>bring U.S.-EU relations forward, the EP did not seriously </p><p>consider lowering the volume of their complaints.  It is </p><p>clear that we have a lot of work to do with the EP, </p><p>especially as it gains new power under the Convention in the </p><p>Justice and Home Affairs area, which could complicate, inter </p><p>alia, management of homeland security concerns where the EP </p><p>has been sharply critical.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>FOSTER </p><p></p></div>
