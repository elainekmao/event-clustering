<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 06604 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  NOVEMBER 4 ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION COMMUNIQUE </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF TYPEWRITTEN TEXT </p><p>OF COMMUNIQUE FROM THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION, </p><p>DELIVERED AFTERNOON NOVEMBER 4 TO BEIRUT DAILY NEWSPAPER </p><p>"AN-NAHAR."  COMMUNIQUE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A </p><p>POLAROID-TYPE COLOR PHOTOGRAPH OF U.S. HOSTAGE TERRY </p><p>ANDERSON.  EMBASSY WILL OBTAIN COPY OF TEXT AND PHOTO AND </p><p>WILL POUCH TO DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>IN THE NAME OF GOD THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE </p><p> </p><p>(KORANIC OPENING PHRASE) </p><p> </p><p>TO THE LIBERALS OF THE WORLD </p><p>TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE </p><p>TO THE FAMILIES OF THE DETAINEES </p><p> </p><p>DAY AFTER DAY THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO </p><p>INCREASE ITS DECEPTIONS, LIES AND COMPLETE   MISLEADING </p><p>OF THE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES OF THE </p><p>DETAINEES, IN ORDER TO REDUCE ANY ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE THE </p><p>AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO COMMENCE PRACTICAL STEPS TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE DETAINEES AND TO SAFEGUARD ITS </p><p>POSITIONS, PRIVILEGES AND SPECIAL INTERESTS.  AFTER THE </p><p>COMMENTS OF REAGAN AND BUSH ON THE CONTENTS OF THE </p><p>VIDEOTAPE ISSUED BY TERRY ANDERSON, WE WISH TO CLARIFY </p><p>THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>1 - THE VIDEOTAPE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT INCLUDED, WAS </p><p>ISSUED DIRECTLY BY TERRY ANDERSON WITHOUT ANY PRESSURES </p><p>AND AS A RESULT OF WRITTEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED MESSAGES SENT </p><p>TO HIM THORUGH NEW AGENCIES.  THE TAPE WAS ISSUED AFTER A </p><p>SHARP AND LARGE DEBATE BETWEEN US AND HIM CONCERNING ALL </p><p>THE IDEAS HE PRESENTED IN IT, WHICH WE FOUND WERE GREATLY </p><p>INCOMPLETE.  TERRY ANDERSON WILL HAVE A SUITABLE REPLY TO </p><p>THE CLAIMS (OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION - ED.). </p><p> </p><p>2 - AMERICA ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO "EVADE" THE CONTENTS OF </p><p>THE TAPE AND LETTERS, WHICH REPRESENT A TRUE REALITY </p><p>WHICH CANNOT BE DEBATED, BY RAISING DOUBTS AS TO THE </p><p>CONTENT OF THE TAPE AND (CLAIMING - ED.) THAT IT WAS </p><p>ISSUED BY THE KIDNAPPERS. </p><p> </p><p>3 - THE DETAINEES IN OUR POSSESSION ARE NOT ISOLATED FROM </p><p>THE EXTERNAL WORLD.  THEY RECEIVE ALL THE NEWS THROUGH </p><p>NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND TELEVISION.  THEY KNOW </p><p>EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED OR HAPPENS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR </p><p>SITUATION, BIG OR SMALL.  WHAT REAGAN SAID IN THIS CASE </p><p>IS LIKE THE OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN THE GROUND SO </p><p>THE HUNTERS WILL NOT SEE IT. </p><p> </p><p>4 - THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, </p><p>HIS VICE PRESIDENT, STAFF AND ASSISTANTS, MADE ALL THE </p><p>DEALS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUE OF DETAINEES; IF THIS WERE </p><p>NOT SO, WHO ELSE NEGOTIATED THE CASE OF THE TWA </p><p>AIRLINER?  HOW WERE THE FORTY PASSENGERS AND 735 </p><p>DETAINEES IN THE PRISONS OF ISRAEL RELEASED?  WHO </p><p>NEGOTIATED THE ISSUE OF "IRAN-CONTRA?"  WHO GAVE THE </p><p>ARMS, TOOK THE FUNDS AND TRANSFERRED SOME TO THE </p><p>CONTRAS?  WE WERE SURPRISED THAT REAGAN RECENTLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL NOW WHO GAVE THE </p><p>ARMS AND WHERE THE FUNDS CAME FROM IN THE "IRANGATE" </p><p>ISSUE.  WAS IT NOT THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION?  OR ARE </p><p>THEY ALL ON A FARM WHERE EACH CROWS ON HIS OWN?  IF THEY </p><p>WERE AWARE, IT IS A CATASTROPHE WHICH CANNOT BE DENIED. </p><p>IF THEY WERE UNAWARE, THE CATASTROPHE IS GREATER. </p><p> </p><p>5 - AS FOR CLAIMS THAT THE CEASEFIRE IN THE GULF WILL </p><p>SPEED THE RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES WITH US, WE REITERATE </p><p>FOR THE ONE-THOUSANDTH TIME OUR INSISTENCE THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>OF ALL THE DETAINEES IS UNCONNECTED, IN PART OR IN WHOLE, </p><p>NEAR OR FAR, WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE GULF.  THE </p><p>HOPE WHICH PREVIOUSLY PREVAILED HAS GONE AND CANNOT COME </p><p>BACK.  THE NON-RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES IS NOW DUE TO THE </p><p>AMERICAN SANCTIMONY, FRAUD AND THE FACT THAT PROMISES AND </p><p>GUARANTEES HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED. </p><p> </p><p>6 - THE ONLY SAFE WAY FOR THE FREEDOM AND SAFETY OF THE </p><p>DETAINEES IS ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR JUST DEMANDS.  THIS IS </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL FOCAL POINT OF THIS ISSUE; NOTHING ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION </p><p>NOVEMBER 2, 1988 </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>MCCARTHY </p><p></p></div>
