<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PRESS SAYS WEST CANNOT STOP "LAND </p><p>REFORM" </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "Demonisation won\'t derail </p><p>      land reform" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" dedicated its August 27 editorial to declaring </p><p>      that Zimbabwe\'s land reform program is irreversible. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "A new wave of hysteria has gripped Britain, </p><p>      Australia and the United States in their bid to </p><p>      demonize the Zimbabwean government as the battle over </p><p>      the country\'s land intensifies.  Having failed to stop </p><p>      the land reform exercise by dislodging the ZANU PF </p><p>      government from power during the 2000 parliamentary </p><p>      elections and the 2002 presidential poll, these </p><p>      Western countries are now throwing tantrums in the </p><p>      hope that something will give. . . We are now </p><p>      witnessing a reincarnation of the pre-2000 </p><p>      parliamentary and 2002 presidential poll campaigns </p><p>      where successive British foreign secretaries shouted </p><p>      blue murder at anything coming out of Harare, whether </p><p>      real or imagined. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .According to the American government, the </p><p>      same forces that were mobilized during the two </p><p>      elections have been re-hired for a fresh </p><p>      onslaught against Zimbabwe. . .  Unfortunately, </p><p>      the plans have come unstuck over the alleged </p><p>      role of South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana </p><p>      in isolating and eventually toppling President </p><p>      Mugabe\'s government as the three Southern </p><p>      Africa countries have dissociated themselves </p><p>      from such uncouth behavior.  While America is </p><p>      still trying to deal with this embarrassment, </p><p>      the Aussies have taken the relay stick in </p><p>      support of their kith and kin in (Rhodesia) </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . .  Trumped up charges of ethnic </p><p>      cleansing are being bandied around to incite </p><p>      hatred against the Zimbabwean government among </p><p>      whites throughout the world. . .  The bottom </p><p>      line, however, is that Zimbabwe belongs to the </p><p>      majority indigenous population and no amount of </p><p>      demonisation will alter the reality that this </p><p>      is their land." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
