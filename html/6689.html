<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT  UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  ESCRAVOS UPDATE - CRISIS WORSENS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU)  Proprietary information please hold closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU)  Summary.   The situation at ChevronTexaco\'s </p><p>Escravos compound has deteriorated markedly since the March </p><p>20 arrival of government troops to quell the confrontation </p><p>between Ijaw and Itsikiri villagers over local political </p><p>power.  Approximately 100 Amcits are inside of the compound </p><p>along with another 100 expatriates, 1800 Nigerian employees, </p><p>and 900 (of an original 2000) Itsikiri displaced persons </p><p>(DP).   An unspecified number of Nigerian troops have also </p><p>taken refuge inside the compound, having been surprised at </p><p>how well the Ijaw villagers outside the compound are armed. </p><p>The company hopes to evacuate all of its employees and the </p><p>displaced persons via two Antonovs that are scheduled to </p><p>arrive sometime tomorrow from South Africa.  There have been </p><p>no injuries since March 17 when one Nigerian catering </p><p>contractor was killed and one injured.  ChevronTexaco\'s </p><p>onshore and swamp 140,000 bpd production has ceased and </p><p>plans are to gradually shut down the remaining 300,000 bpd. </p><p>(Note:  Omole asked that this last figure be treated as </p><p>confidential.)  ChevronTexaco\'s security Manager has </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>indicated that the company may ask for USG assistance in </p><p>approaching the GON if the situation does not improve by </p><p>Saturday, March 22.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU)  On March 21 at 1440, Sola Omole, General </p><p>Manager, Government and Public Affairs Department for </p><p>ChevronTexaco called Econoff to report on the escalating </p><p>tensions between warring villagers around ChevronTexaco\'s </p><p>Escravos Tank Farm and to ask for USG assistance in </p><p>contacting the GON.  Omole reported that the Ijaws outside </p><p>the compound and security forces inside were shooting at one </p><p>another.  In a subsequent conversation,  ChevronTexaco\'s </p><p>security manager Ray Keel  indicated that if the situation </p><p>does not improve, the company might ask for USG help on </p><p>Saturday, March 22.  As of 1800,  Chevron has shut down its </p><p>onshore and swamp operations, halted the production of </p><p>140,000 bpd of crude oil, and hopes to evacuate all of its </p><p>non-essential personnel and the villagers who are seeking </p><p>refuge on the compound. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU)  Omole requested that the Ambassador use his </p><p>office to intercede at the level of the Nigerian presidency. </p><p>Although he was not specific about what he was asking for, </p><p>Omole indicated that the situation in Escravos was </p><p>deteriorating.   (Comment:  We learned in a subsequent </p><p>conversation that the President had been informed of </p><p>ChevronTexaco\'s situation through Carl Masters, an associate </p><p>of  former Ambassador Andrew Young.  End comment.)   Omole </p><p>also spoke to the British High Commissioner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.    (SBU) ConGen RSO met with ChevronTexaco security </p><p>officers who largely confirmed Omole\'s assessment of the </p><p>situation.   The Safety Manager told the CG and the RSO that </p><p>he is considering asking the Ambassador for assistance, but </p><p>the company was also approaching the government from other </p><p>angles.  Later, Keel told CG that the company has contacted </p><p>NNPC and the Nigerian military.  If these representations </p><p>prove unsuccessful by tomorrow, the company may ask for USG </p><p>assistance to press the government to stop the fighting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU)  In separate conversations, Keel told CG and RSO </p><p>that the Ijaws are better armed with AK-47s and RPGs than </p><p>anyone - including the Nigerian military - expected them to </p><p>be.  Having caused the Nigerian security forces to retreat </p><p>onto Chevron\'s property, the Ijaws are now accusing the </p><p>company of colluding with their Itsikiri enemies who are </p><p>also inside the compound. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.    (SBU)  Chevron is awaiting the arrival of two Antonovs </p><p>(there were previous reports of a C-130) from South Africa </p><p>via Uganda to evacuate the expatriates, the Nigerian staff, </p><p>and the last 900 of the 2000 refugees remaining on its </p><p>compound.  The planes are expected to arrive at the Escravos </p><p>airstrip no sooner than Saturday, March 22. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
