HARARE 1381 </p><p>     B. HARARE 863 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 10, High Court Justice Susan Mavangira upheld </p><p>Minister of Local Government Ignatius Chombo\'s controversial </p><p>suspension of Harare MDC Mayor Elias Mudzuri for alleged </p><p>misconduct.  In effect this ruling bars Mudzuri from going to </p><p>his office, and from carrying out the functions of mayor. </p><p>Minister Chombo has also called for the Mayor to be evicted </p><p>from his official residence.  The Deputy Mayor, also an MDC </p><p>member, has taken over the functions of the Mayor and is </p><p>reportedly collaborating with the Minister.  While the </p><p>situation looks bad for the MDC, with the good impression he </p><p>made at a recent conference of mayors in Denver and at the </p><p>Corporate Council on Africa meetings, (Ref B), the Mayor </p><p>could instead become an important emissary for the MDC </p><p>overseas.  And the current Deputy Mayor\'s term ends in </p><p>August, at which time the MDC council will elect a new person </p><p>who would presumably be more ready to accept MDC guidance. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Suspension Upheld </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On July 10, High Court Justice Susan Mavangira </p><p>upheld Minister of Local Government Ignatius Chombo\'s </p><p>controversial suspension of Harare MDC Mayor Elias Mudzuri </p><p>for alleged misconduct.  In effect this ruling bars Mudzuri </p><p>from going to his office, and from carrying out the functions </p><p>of Mayor.  Mudzuri told the Ambassador that he has no </p><p>intention of defying the court order by going to his office. </p><p> </p><p>Minister Calls for Mayor\'s Eviction </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 8, Chombo wrote a letter to the Acting Mayor, </p><p>Deputy Mayor Sekesayi Makwavarara, directing the withdrawal </p><p>of other benefits to the Mayor including eviction from the </p><p>official residence, withdrawal of the official vehicle, and </p><p>withdrawal of any bodyguards or aides.  While Mavangira\'s </p><p>order made no mention of these benefits, Chombo appeared on a </p><p>state television broadcast on July 10 saying that security </p><p>agents would go to the Mayor\'s residence on July 11 to evict </p><p>him.  The Mayor, his lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, and the MDC are </p><p>still deciding whether to appeal his suspension - they have </p><p>ten days in which to file - however, Mtetwa said the Mayor </p><p>planned to surround himself with security guards and resist </p><p>the eviction.  If he is evicted, Mtetwa said they would </p><p>likely go to court to have this action overturned. </p><p> </p><p>Investigation Stalled </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) After calling for the Mayor\'s suspension in April </p><p>2003, Chombo appointed a group of six ZANU-PF insiders to </p><p>conduct the investigation into alleged misconduct.  Although </p><p>the identities of the investigators has not been officially </p><p>announced, Mtetwa has learned who they are and has sent them </p><p>letters inquiring whether they have in fact been named, and </p><p>offering appointments with the Mayor, noting that no </p><p>investigator has yet sought to interview Mudzuri.  Mtetwa </p><p>also learned that three of the would-be investigators have </p><p>said they do not want the duty. </p><p> </p><p>Deputy Mayor Collaborating with Chombo </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) At lunch with the Ambassador on July 10, Mudzuri said </p><p>the Deputy Mayor Sekesai Makwavarara is collaborating with </p><p>Chombo - that effectively Chombo is running the city.  In a </p><p>recent urban councils meeting with other mayors, Makwavarara </p><p>stated that everything was going well in her office.  Mudzuri </p><p>also said a few other MDC councilors were collaborating in </p><p>exchange for payment.  According to MDC presidential advisor </p><p>Gandi Mudzingwa, Mudzuri himself brought in Makwavarara after </p><p>his election, against the wishes of the council, but he and </p><p>Makwavarara subsequently had a falling out.  The MDC </p><p>leadership met with Harare councilors on July 10 to build </p><p>solidarity with them, and to convey to Makwavarara that </p><p>regardless of personal differences with Mudzuri, she had an </p><p>obligation to stick with the principles of the party. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mudzingwa said the Deputy Mayor\'s term ends in August </p><p>2003; at that time the council will elect a new Deputy </p><p>(Acting) Mayor. </p><p>Comment: </p><p>7. (C) What appears at first glance to be real setback for </p><p>Mayor Mudzuri and the MDC may not be as bad as it looks. </p><p>Although the Mayor may have essentially lost his job, he made </p><p>a good impression on other mayors at a recent conference in </p><p>Denver and at the Corporate Council on Africa meetings, (Ref </p><p>B), and he could be an important emissary for the MDC abroad. </p><p> Although the Deputy Mayor appears to be collaborating with </p><p>Minister Chombo, her term ends next month and presumably, the </p><p>38-strong MDC council will elect a different MDC </p><p>Deputy/Acting Mayor who would toe the MDC line.  Chombo might </p><p>choose to dismiss that person as well, and perhaps the entire </p><p>MDC-dominated council, but such a radical step would be </p><p>controversial and have its own consequences.  In the ongoing </p><p>saga, the Combined Harare Residents\' Association (CHRA), an </p><p>active advocacy organization, could be an important force in </p><p>checking Chombo\'s de facto attempt to take back Harare for </p><p>ZANU-PF through non-elective means.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
