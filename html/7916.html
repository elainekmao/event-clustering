<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000888 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZCTU REMAINS NONCOMMITTAL ON FUTURE MASS ACTION </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. Discussions with the Zimbabwe Congress of </p><p>Trade Unions\' (ZCTU\'s) chief economist indicate that while </p><p>the organization is willing to publicly flex its muscles, it </p><p>continues to be noncommittal about supporting politically- </p><p>driven calls for mass action.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The ZCTU continues to see its path as separate </p><p>from and complementary to, rather than congruous with, that </p><p>of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC).  Although the ZCTU made strong statements at its May </p><p>Day celebrations that it would address political issues when </p><p>they affect its membership, the ZCTU\'s primary thrust </p><p>continues to address economic and workplace issues. </p><p>Nevertheless, labor contacts hint that there would be tacit </p><p>support -- if not outright mobilization -- in response to an </p><p>expected MDC call for mass action in the next few weeks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Comment:  Labor sources continue to express an </p><p>awareness of their own role as distinct from the role of </p><p>opposition leaders.  Although they are proud to be the </p><p>source of the opposition party, they do not feel obligated </p><p>to march in lock-step.  We strongly suspect -- due to the </p><p>large crossover in membership -- that many individual ZCTU </p><p>members will heed an MDC call for mass action.  However, the </p><p>ZCTU as an organization remains bound by the concepts of </p><p>consultation and consensus, which (notwithstanding the most </p><p>recent mass action) often prevent swift mobilization.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
