<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003488 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICIANS PRESS CENTRAL BANK TO CUT INTEREST </p><p>RATES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3319 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Government ministers continue to ratchet up the </p><p>pressure on the Central Bank to cut overnight interest rates, </p><p>arguing that such a move is needed to weaken the </p><p>recently-robust lira and prevent Turkey\'s growing current </p><p>account deficit from deteriorating further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The pressure began to rise last Friday, after the </p><p>Central Bank reported that the current account deficit had </p><p>reached 2.368 billion in the first quarter, compared to a </p><p>$479 million deficit in the first quarter of 2002.  The </p><p>official target for the year is $3.5 billion.  Shortly after </p><p>the Bank\'s announcement, Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan </p><p>predicted a rate cut "soon." Prime Minister Erdogan said he </p><p>was confident the Bank would lower rates, adding that a 3-5 </p><p>percentage point cut (from the current 41 percent) would help </p><p>"balance" the exchange rate.  "We hear the suffering of the </p><p>business world.  God willing the Central Bank governor and </p><p>his team hear the sensitivity on this issue, and I think they </p><p>will take the necessary steps." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  On May 28, following a meeting with the visiting </p><p>IMF Mission Chief, Union of Chambers President Rifat </p><p>Hisarciklioglu publicly reminded politicians that the Central </p><p>Bank was an independent organization and should not be </p><p>pressured on interest rates.  Such pressure, he warned, would </p><p>hurt Turkey\'s image in global markets.  Industry Minister Ali </p><p>Coskun replied that the GOT was not interfering in the </p><p>Central Bank\'s business, but said he personally expected the </p><p>Bank to be "sensitive" and reduce interest rates further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) State Minister Kursad Tuzmen, the always outspoken </p><p>advocate of exporters, issued the strongest statement so far </p><p>today.  He urged the Bank to take steps immediately to weaken </p><p>the lira, warning that "independent bodies preserve their </p><p>independence by acting earlier, more actively, before their </p><p>independence becomes a subject for debate.  That would be </p><p>craftsmanship, competence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti told us </p><p>last week (reftel) that the Bank would not stray from its own </p><p>measures to determine whether and when to lower interest </p><p>rates.  Serdentecti defended the Bank\'s independence in a </p><p>speech to opposition CHP deputies today, reportedly saying </p><p>that "you don\'t cut rates just because the marekts expect it </p><p>or because there is political pressure to do so." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Some market analysts are joining the call for </p><p>Central Bank action.  HSBC argued that, since the strong lira </p><p>was putting downward pressure on inflation and inflationary </p><p>expectations were falling, there was a strong economic </p><p>argument for a rate cut, which in turn would allow yields on </p><p>government t-bills to fall.  Other analysts said growing </p><p>expectations for a rate cut contributed to today\'s decline in </p><p>t-bill yields, with the benchmark 07/07/04 bill paying 48.76 </p><p>percent, down from 50.15 percent Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Comment:  Whatever the arguments for a rate cut, </p><p>this strong public, political pressure puts the Central Bank </p><p>in a bind.  Should it decide to reduce overnight rates, it </p><p>will be hard pressed to convince observers that it is doing </p><p>so for economic reasons rather than in response to political </p><p>pressure.  CB Governor Serdengecti is acutely aware of the </p><p>need to maintain credibility, and of how quickly he can lose </p><p>that credibility if markets begin to question his </p><p>independence and commitment to disinflation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
