<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000261 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/RSP AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  REACTION TO SECRETARY\'S UNSC PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) State 33974  B) State 34169 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In a meeting with Assistant Foreign Minister Nguyen </p><p>Duc Hung on February 6, Charge delivered a copy of Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s presentation to the February 5 open meeting of the </p><p>UNSC and reinforced it with the points provided in para 2 of </p><p>ref B.  Hung said that the GVN was "still studying" the </p><p>Secretary\'s speech and would probably not have any </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>substantive reaction until "tomorrow or next week."  He did </p><p>comment, however, that the GVN hoped that the United States </p><p>could avoid going to war against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Perhaps due to the late night timing (local) of the </p><p>Secretary\'s presentation, there has been no official GVN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>comment as of COB February 6.  The MFA canceled its regular </p><p>Thursday press briefing and now plans no further press </p><p>briefings until February 20. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On January 30, MFA spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh had </p><p>asserted officially that "all available information </p><p>indicates that Iraq has been and is cooperating with the UN </p><p>according to Resolution 1441" and expressed a wish for the </p><p>Iraq issue to be "resolved peacefully on the basis of </p><p>respect for Iraq\'s independence, sovereignty and territorial </p><p>integrity in conformity with the UN Charter and </p><p>international laws."  A Vietnam News Service commentary on </p><p>February 1 claimed that "The US\' insistent disbelief of </p><p>Iraq\'s claims can only mean war is near" and that "current </p><p>information proves that Iraq has been co-operating with the </p><p>UN." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Vietnamese television reported on February 5 and 6 </p><p>the Secretary\'s presentation to the UN Security Council, but </p><p>did not carry the presentation in full.  It added that many </p><p>Americans believed that the speech contained no "new </p><p>information" or was "hard to believe."  TV news also carried </p><p>a report of an anti-war demonstration in New York City.  The </p><p>Communist Party\'s flagstaff "People" (Nhan Dan) daily </p><p>newspaper on February 6 carried a Reuters account of the </p><p>presentation at the end of a longer article under the title </p><p>of "The danger of an attack on Iraq grows nearer."  Leading </p><p>that article were "confirmations" from Saddam Hussein, from </p><p>his British TV interview, that Iraq did not have weapons of </p><p>mass destruction, as well as accusations that the U.S. </p><p>sought to attack Iraq in order to gain control of Middle </p><p>East oil resources.  Coverage in the "People\'s Army" daily </p><p>was similar, under a sub-title "many countries oppose the US </p><p>plot to attack Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In Ho Chi Minh City, two newspaper contacts told the </p><p>ConGen that the Secretary\'s presentation was impressive and </p><p>credited the U.S. for setting out its case relatively </p><p>objectively.  They added that there was no smoking gun, </p><p>which ultimately made it less convincing.  Of four ConGen </p><p>local Vietnamese business contacts, only two were familiar </p><p>with the content of the speech.  They stated that the speech </p><p>was a clear indication the U.S. will go to war, although </p><p>they would prefer a peaceful solution to the problem. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
