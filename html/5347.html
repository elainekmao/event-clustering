<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR ECA; NEA/PPD (JDAVIES, CBOURGEOIS, WMOONEY, ACASPER, </p><p>DMACINNES); NEA/ARP (LMALENAS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  KPAO, OEXC, SCUL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  COMMUNICATING ACROSS CULTURES:  U.S. AND UAE </p><p>STUDENTS DISCUSS CONFLICT, CAMELS, AND COUSINS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  ON JANUARY 7, 2003, APAO ATTENDED A </p><p>DIGITAL VIDEO CONFERENCE BETWEEN EMIRATI WOMEN FROM </p><p>ZAYED UNIVERSITY AND STUDENTS OF A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>IN SYRACUSE, NEW YORK.  AS PART OF A COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>COURSE PROJECT, THE EMIRATI STUDENTS DESIGNED A SURVEY </p><p>AND A SERIES OF DVCS TO BRIDGE A CULTURAL AND POLITICAL </p><p>GAP BETWEEN U.S. AND UAE STUDENTS.  THE DISCUSSION </p><p>RANGED FROM TERRORISM, IRAQ, AND "WHY DO THEY HATE US?" </p><p>TO SINGERS, CAMELS, AND MARRIAGE.  OVERALL, ONE THING IS </p><p>VERY CLEAR:  WHILE CRITICAL OF USG POLICIES, YOUNG </p><p>EMIRATI WOMEN SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR LIVES </p><p>SURFING AMERICAN WEBSITES, WATCHING AMERICAN MOVIES, </p><p>LISTENING TO AMERICAN MUSIC, AND WEARING POPULAR </p><p>AMERICAN CLOTHES, ALBEIT UNDER THEIR ABAYAS AND SHAYLAS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A COMMUNICATIONS COURSE AT THE ABU DHABI </p><p>CAMPUS OF ZAYED UNIVERSITY (ZU), AN ELITE UNIVERSITY FOR </p><p>EMIRATI WOMEN, DEVELOPED A COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY TO </p><p>PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE UAE, ARABIC CULTURE, AND </p><p>ISLAM TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN NEW YORK.  THE CLASS </p><p>LAUNCHED THE PROJECT BY CONDUCTING A SURVEY OF CATHOLIC </p><p>HIGH SCHOOLS IN SYRACUSE, NEW YORK, FOCUSING ON </p><p>STUDENTS\' PERCEPTIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE AMERICAN </p><p>STUDENTS\' RESPONSES TO THE SURVEY INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>--94 PERCENT BELIEVE THE UAE IS A DANGEROUS PLACE TO </p><p>LIVE; 50 PERCENT BELIEVE ISLAM IS A RELIGION THAT </p><p>ENCOURAGES TERRORISM; 70 PERCENT BELIEVE UAE WOMEN COVER </p><p>THEMSELVES BECAUSE ARAB SOCIETY IS NOT MODERN; NONE OF </p><p>THE STUDENTS BELIEVED THE UAE HAS MODERN CITIES WITH </p><p>HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS; 88 PERCENT THINK THE UAE DOESN\'T </p><p>HAVE SHOPPING MALLS; AND 44 PERCENT BELIEVE EMIRATIS </p><p>STILL USE CAMELS TO GET TO WORK AND SCHOOL EVERY DAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE EMIRATI STUDENTS THEN DEVELOPED A COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>STRATEGY TO DISCUSS WITH THE STUDENTS AT THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>BROTHERS ACADEMY.  THE EMIRATI STUDENTS FOCUSED ON THE </p><p>AMERICAN STUDENTS\' INACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF ARAB </p><p>CULTURE, ISLAM, AND THE UAE.  BOTH STUDENTS QUESTIONS </p><p>RANGED FROM "WHY DO THEY HATE US," TO CULTURAL AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, ABORTION, DATING AND MARRIAGE, </p><p>MUSICIANS, AND LIFE IN THE U.S. AND UAE.  WHILE </p><p>DEMOSTRATING LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UAE OR THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST, THE AMERICAN STUDENTS EMPHASIZED AMERICANS </p><p>GENERALLY HOLD NO AGGRESSIONS OR PREDUJICES AGAINST ANY </p><p>PEOPLE BASED SOLELY ON ETHNICITY OR RELIGION, ESPECIALLY </p><p>ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  CONVERSELY, THE EMIRATI STUDENTS </p><p>EXPRESSED THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTINUED INTEREST IN </p><p>AMERICAN POP CULTURE AND INTERNET SITES BUT OPPOSITION </p><p>TO U.S. FOREIGN POLICY.  QUESTIONS INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>--(EMIRATIS) Q:  DO YOU THINK WE OR OTHER ARABS ARE </p><p>TERRORISTS.  (AMERICANS) A:  NO. </p><p> </p><p>--(EMIRATIS) Q:  DO ANY OF YOU WANT TO TRAVEL TO THE UAE </p><p>OR THE MIDDLE EAST?  (AMERICANS - MAJORITY) A:  NO. </p><p>IT\'S TOO DANGEROUS.  (A FEW REPLIED WITH A "YES.") </p><p> </p><p>--(EMIRATIS) Q:  DO YOU SUPPORT A WAR AGAINST IRAQ? </p><p>(AMERICANS) A:  YES AND NO.  (COMMENT:  FOUR OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN STUDENTS LAUNCHED INTO A HEATED DEBATE ABOUT A </p><p>WAR IN IRAQ, A FEW OPPOSING ANY ATTACK.  THE EMIRATI </p><p>STUDENTS SEEMED SURPRISED BY THIS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--(AMERICANS) Q:  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A WAR AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ? (EMIRATIS) A:  WE DO NOT LIKE SADDAM AT ALL.  WE </p><p>THINK HE SHOULD BE REMOVED AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM </p><p>GO.  WE OPPOSE A WAR RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT IRAQI WOMEN AND CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>--(AMERICANS) Q:  ARE YOU ALLOWED TO DATE MEN AT ALL? </p><p>(EMIRATIS) A:  NO, BUT SOME GIRLS BREAK THE RULES.  IT </p><p>DEPENDS ON THE FAMILY.  WE OR OUR FAMILIES PICK THE MAN </p><p>WE WILL MARRY.  BUT MOST FAMILIES LET EACH GIRL DECIDE </p><p>AS LONG AS THEY DON\'T OBJECT TO THE POTENTIAL HUSBAND. </p><p>WE OFTEN MARRY OUR COUSINS. </p><p> </p><p>--(AMERICANS - REACTING TO THE PREVIOUS RESPONSE WITH A </p><p>LOUD \'EWE\') Q:  COUSINS?  (EMIRATIS) A:  YES.  OUR </p><p>FAMILIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT.  WE TRY TO MAINTAIN THEM. </p><p> </p><p>--(AMERICANS) Q:  AT WHAT AGE ARE YOU ALLOWED TO MAKE </p><p>YOUR OWN RULES AND DECISIONS?  (EMIRATIS) A:  WHEN WE </p><p>GET MARRIED, WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM TO MAKE OUR OWN </p><p>DECISIONS BUT ARE STILL BOUND TO OUR CULTURE AND FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>--(AMERICANS) Q:  HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO GET A JOB </p><p>AFTER YOU FINISH SCHOOL?  (EMIRATIS) A:  ALL OF US </p><p>(EXCEPT ONE - THIS STUDENT WANTED TO PURSUE GRADUATE </p><p>STUDY IN THE U.S., U.K., OR SWITZERLAND, WHERE HER </p><p>FAMILY OWNS SEVERAL HOMES). </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  THE EMIRATIS\' STATEMENTS ON IRAQ, AMERICAN </p><p>CULTURE, EMPLOYMENT, AND POLITICS WERE VERY REVEALING OF </p><p>EMIRATI SOCIETY, CONSIDERING THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM </p><p>COME FROM PROMINENT FAMILIES.  EACH STUDENT INDICATED A </p><p>DESIRE TO SEEK PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT, SOMETHING </p><p>FAR MORE THAN THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF HOUSEWIFE AND </p><p>MOTHER.  THIS IS A REAL POSSIBILITY FOR MOST OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS, AS SHEIKHA FATIMA, THE FAVORED WIFE OF UAE </p><p>PRESIDENT SHEIKH ZAYED BIN SULTAN AL NAHYAN, AND OTHER </p><p>PROMINENT EMIRATI WOMEN CONTINUE TO OPEN NEW </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR EMIRATI WOMEN </p><p>IN THE UAE GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMY.  THE MOST INTERESTING </p><p>POINT TO EMERGE FROM THE DISCUSSION IS HOW CLEARLY </p><p>EMIRATI STUDENTS CONTINUE TO SEPARATE THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE, CULTURE, AND \'AMERICANA,\' FROM USG POLICIES. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
