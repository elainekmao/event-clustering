(C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWE\'S RULING ZANU-PF HAS </p><p>REENERGIZED ITSELF AND WRESTED SOME OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>MOMENTUM FROM THE OPPOSITION MDC, BUT IT FACES AN UPHILL </p><p>BATTLE IN MAINTAINING ITS MOMENTUM THROUGH THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN EARLY 2002.  ZANU-PF\'S VICTORY </p><p>IN THE MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION, THE LAYING TO REST OF </p><p>RUMORS OF MUGABE\'S RETIREMENT AT THE DECEMBER PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, AND A NEW, YOUNGER POLITBURO HAVE BREATHED NEW </p><p>LIFE INTO A PARTY THAT RECENTLY APPEARED HEADED FOR THE </p><p>SCRAPHEAP.  THE PARTY\'S NEWFOUND SENSE OF PURPOSE, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO GREATER SUPPORT AMONG </p><p>EVERYDAY ZIMBABWEANS.  THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE RULING PARTY\'S TACTICS, AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ABILITY TO WIN NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTION </p><p>IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DOUBT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A REJUVENATED ZANU-PF </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ALTHOUGH ZANU-PF\'S LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT HAS </p><p>NOT INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, RECENT EVENTS HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00114  01 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>HELPED TO REENERGIZE PARTY FOLLOWERS, WHO, UNTIL </p><p>RECENTLY, SEEMED READY TO JUMP SHIP.  ZANU-PF HELD ON TO </p><p>ITS MARONDERA WEST PARLIAMENTARY SEAT IN THE NOVEMBER </p><p>BY-ELECTION, ALBEIT ONLY AFTER WEEKS OF VIOLENT </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF THE LOCAL ELECTORATE (REF C).  IN A WAY, </p><p>THE BY-ELECTION VALIDATED THE PARTY\'S TACTICS, AND IT </p><p>SENT A MESSAGE TO THE PARTY LEADERSHIP THAT IT DOES HAVE </p><p>THE MEANS TO STAY IN POWER.  A LOSS IN A TRADITIONAL </p><p>MASHONALAND STRONGHOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DECEMBER\'S ZANU-PF CONGRESS HELPED TO RALLY THE </p><p>PARTY FAITHFUL AROUND MUGABE\'S LAND REFORM AGENDA AND </p><p>CONVINCE THEM THAT ZANU-PF STILL HAS A FUTURE (REF B). </p><p>MUGABE\'S EMPHASIS ON THE FAST-TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM AND HIS OBVIOUS DESIRE TO KEEP ZANU-PF IN POWER </p><p>GAVE HARD-CORE PARTY MEMBERS A NEW SENSE OF PURPOSE. </p><p>THE CONGRESS ALSO DISPELLED THE CONFUSION AND </p><p>UNCERTAINTY ABOUT MUGABE\'S INTENTION TO STAY AT THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S HELM--HE IS HERE TO STAY AND WILL BE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW, YOUNGER POLITBURO (REF A) WAS </p><p>A REBUKE OF THE PARTY\'S OLD GUARD, ACCORDING TO IDEN </p><p>WETHERELL, EDITOR OF THE "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT."  NOT </p><p>ONLY DID IT INFUSE NEW (BUT LOYAL) BLOOD INTO THE PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP, IT SIDELINED THE OLD GUARD THAT HAD FAILED </p><p>TO WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE PEOPLE, WETHERELL </p><p>BELIEVES.  THE LIKES OF 36-YEAR-OLD YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER BORDER GEZI AND INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO DEFINITELY HAVE MORE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM TO PUSH </p><p>THE PARTY\'S AGENDA AND COW THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00114  01 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MUGABE IS FIRMLY IN CONTROL </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  EDDISON ZVOBGO, THE FORMER MINISTER WHO WAS </p><p>UNCEREMONIOUSLY DUMPED FROM THE POLITBURO (BUT IS STILL </p><p>A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER, AS WELL AS AN MP), TOLD US </p><p>THAT MUGABE IS MORE FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF ZANU-PF THAN HE </p><p>HAS EVER BEEN.  THE PARTY NO LONGER ACTS AS A CHECK ON </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S POWERS, ZVOBGO CONTINUED.  INSTEAD, THE </p><p>PARTY IS SIMPLY AN INSTRUMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.  DURING </p><p>THE 1980S, THE POLITBURO WAS KNOWN TO OVERRULE MUGABE ON </p><p>POLICY MATTERS, BUT NOW MUGABE IS A "MAJORITY OF ONE" IN </p><p>THE PARTY.  ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SURVIVE MUST TRY TO </p><p>PLEASE THE PRESIDENT BY SAYING WHAT HE THINKS MUGABE </p><p>WANTS TO HEAR, ACCORDING TO ZVOBGO.  THE FORMER MINISTER </p><p>DESCRIBED THIS REALITY AS "PATHETIC." </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO WETHERELL, MUGABE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN </p><p>CHARGE OF ZANU-PF, AND HE SIMPLY WON\'T ALLOW ANYONE TO </p><p>USURP HIS POWER.  THE SO-CALLED "YOUNG TURKS"--NEWER, </p><p>REFORM-MINDED MEMBERS OF THE PARTY--ARE AS UNHAPPY AS </p><p>EVER, BUT JUST AS POWERLESS AS BEFORE.  MUGABE IS IN </p><p>GREATER CONTROL OF THE PARTY BECAUSE, SAYS WETHERELL, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1851 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00114  02 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------B39B6D  081604Z /38 </p><p>O 081603Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7959 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/01 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00114  02 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: REJUVENATION OF ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY UNLIKELY </p><p>TO CARRY IT THROUGH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>EVERY NEWCOMER TO THE POLITBURO IS A PRODUCT OF MUGABE\'S </p><p>PATRONAGE MACHINE, AND NONE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT POWER </p><p>BASE.  FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, SOMETIMES TOUTED </p><p>AS A POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO MUGABE, HAS BEEN WEAKENED-- </p><p>PARADOXICALLY--BY HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE POLITBURO </p><p>BECAUSE NOW HE IS COMPLETELY BEHOLDEN TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>FOR HIS POSITION IN THE PARTY, WETHERELL STATED.  AS FOR </p><p>SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, MUGABE BROUGHT </p><p>HIM BACK FROM POLITICAL OBLIVION TO SILENCE THE </p><p>OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT AND TO DEAL WITH MALCONTENTS IN </p><p>ZANU-PF.  THE TWO NEED EACH OTHER, WETHERELL ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AN UPHILL BATTLE FOR MUGABE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DESPITE ZANU-PF\'S APPARENT REVITALIZATION, </p><p>MUGABE FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE TO WIN A THIRD </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL TERM IN NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTION.  IN FACT, OUR </p><p>CONTACTS SAY THERE IS "NO WAY" HE CAN WIN.  ZVOBGO TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE REQUIRED TO COW THE ENTIRE </p><p>ELECTORATE WOULD BE "UNACCEPTABLE," AND MUGABE CLEARLY </p><p>CANNOT RUN ON HIS RECORD GIVEN THE NEAR COLLAPSE OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  BECAUSE THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE IS A STRAIGHT </p><p>NATIONAL HEAD COUNT WITH NO RUN-OFFS (AS OPPOSED TO A </p><p>FIRST-PAST-THE-POST VOTE IN A DISTRICT-BY-DISTRICT </p><p>SYSTEM), TSVANGIRAI ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE VOTE THAN MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00114  02 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>TO BEAT HIM.  THE URBAN AREAS, MATABELELAND AND </p><p>MANICALAND WILL GO SOLIDLY TO THE MDC, AND MIDLANDS WILL </p><p>BE SPLIT 50-50, ZVOBGO SAYS.  MASHONALAND WILL STILL </p><p>VOTE LARGELY FOR ZANU-PF, ZVOBGO CONTENDS, LEAVING </p><p>MASVINGO AS SOMETHING OF A WILD CARD.  HOWEVER, BY HIS </p><p>CALCULATION, A LARGE, PRO-MDC TURNOUT IN URBAN AREAS </p><p>WILL WIN THE DAY OVER LOW TURNOUTS IN THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>ZANU-PF RURAL AREAS.  THE SMART MOVE FOR MUGABE, ZVOBGO </p><p>SAID, WOULD BE TO RESIGN IN OCTOBER THIS YEAR AND CALL A </p><p>SNAP ELECTION BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE RAINS.  IF THE </p><p>ELECTION WERE HELD ON SCHEDULE, I.E. SHORTLY BEFORE </p><p>MUGABE\'S TERM ENDS ON MARCH 31, 2002, MUGABE COULD BE </p><p>EVEN MORE UNPOPULAR IF HEAVY RAINS WIPED OUT A LOT OF </p><p>ROADS AND BRIDGES, AS THEY DID IN EARLY 2000, AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DIDN\'T HAVE THE MEANS TO RESPOND.  THE MOVE </p><p>WOULD ALSO SURPRISE THE OPPOSITION AND GIVE THEM LESS </p><p>TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE ELECTION.  ZVOBGO EVEN PROPOSED </p><p>THIS PLAN TO MUGABE, BUT THE PRESIDENT REJECTED IT OUT </p><p>OF HAND, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WETHERELL WAS IN AGREEMENT THAT NO LEVEL OF </p><p>VIOLENCE CAN WIN THE ELECTION FOR MUGABE.  THE PARTY </p><p>CAN\'T RESORT TO WIDESPREAD RIGGING, EITHER, BECAUSE THE </p><p>ELECTION WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORED BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS.  THE URBAN AREAS, MATABELELAND AND MANICALAND </p><p>STRONGLY BACK THE MDC, WHILE MASHONALAND BACKS ZANU-PF. </p><p>THAT LEAVES MIDLANDS AND MASVINGO PROVINCES AS KEY </p><p>BATTLEGROUNDS, THE EDITOR STATED.  MUGABE WILL "GO FOR </p><p>BROKE" IN THESE AREAS AND MASHONALAND TO WIN THE </p><p>ELECTION.  WETHERELL DID NOT HAVE ANY FIRM PREDICTIONS </p><p>ON WHAT THE MILITARY MIGHT DO, BUT HE DID NOT THINK IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00114  02 OF 03  081603Z </p><p>WOULD "DO ANYTHING STUPID" TO KEEP MUGABE IN POWER. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>NOT ENOUGH YES MEN TO GO AROUND </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: A BUNCH OF ROOTLESS "YES MEN" NOW </p><p>COMPRISE THE LEADERSHIP OF ZANU-PF.  THEY NEED MUGABE </p><p>MORE THAN EVER FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD, AND HE NEEDS THEM </p><p>TO RUN THE DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS OF THE STATE, MOBILIZE </p><p>THE MASSES, AND PROVIDE SUPPORT AFTER SETBACKS.  MUGABE </p><p>APPEARS TO BE THE MAIN GUARANTOR OF ZANU-PF\'S EXISTENCE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES OF CRISIS.  THE VIABILITY OF </p><p>THE PARTY, AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, IS NOT GUARANTEED IN </p><p>A POST-MUGABE ERA.  MNANGAGWA APPEARS TO HAVE ENGINEERED </p><p>THE PROMOTION OF A NUMBER OF YOUNGER PARTY MEMBERS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD BE PERSONALLY LOYAL TO HIM IN A </p><p>POST-MUGABE SCENARIO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: DESPITE ZANU-PF\'S INTERNAL </p><p>REJUVENATION AND RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE, IT IS STILL A </p><p>WIDELY UNPOPULAR PARTY AMONG ZIMBABWEANS AS A WHOLE. </p><p>THE NUMBER OF HARD-CORE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS--THOSE LIKELY </p><p>BENEFITING DIRECTLY FROM ZANU-PF RULE--HAS SHRUNK TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1852 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00114  03 OF 03  081604Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------B39B73  081604Z /38 </p><p>O 081603Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7960 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/01 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00114  03 OF 03  081604Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: REJUVENATION OF ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY UNLIKELY </p><p>TO CARRY IT THROUGH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>FEWER THAN 15 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICA-BASED HELEN SUZMAN FOUNDATION.
