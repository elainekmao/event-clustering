<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002566 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DAS PERRY, LONDON FOR GURNEY, PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, XY, LI, IV, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: CORRECTED COPY: NIGERIA: EMBASSY REVISITS ISSUE OF </p><p>FALSE ECOWAS REPORT CLAIMING US/UK LURD CONNECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 02016 </p><p>     B. PERRY-BROWNE EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corrected Copy: Tags, text corrections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action message; see paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary. Ambassador again raised allegations of U.S./ </p><p>UK support for Lurd in Liberia with ECOWAS Deputy Executive </p><p>Secretary, General Cheick Diarra. After reiterating that the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. and UK do not support Lurd rebels in any way, the </p><p>Ambassador asked that ECOWAS publicly deny GOL claims that </p><p>their information came from an official, authorized, and </p><p>approved ECOWAS report.  Diarra agreed to present USG </p><p>position to Executive Secretary Chambas, and requested that </p><p>U.S. provide ECOWAS with a copy of the report being </p><p>disseminated by GOL Embassy in Abidjan. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In an August 29 meeting with ECOWAS Deputy Executive </p><p>Secretary Diarra, Ambassador Jeter recalled his July 3 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>meeting on the same subject and reemphasized that GOL claims </p><p>of U.S. and UK support of Lurd forces were both false and </p><p>malicious.  The U.S. was concerned because continued </p><p>propagation of these false allegations could harm U.S. </p><p>relations and interests in the West African sub-region and </p><p>damage U.S. relations with ECOWAS just as those relations </p><p>were at their strongest.  Because the claims were allegedly </p><p>based on an official ECOWAS report, the Ambassador asked that </p><p>ECOWAS join the USG in publicly "clearing the air". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) General Diarra explained that the report being cited </p><p>was a raw draft crafted by the Ecowas-mandated Military </p><p>Mission to Liberia.  He explained that the ECOWAS Secretariat </p><p>rejected the claims of U.S./UK complicity with the Lurd and </p><p>its final report made no mention of the allegations.  To </p><p>reinforce his sincerity, Diarra gave the Ambassador a copy of </p><p>the Executive Secretariat Memorandum and the Military </p><p>Assessment Mission to Liberia, and the final Report of the </p><p>Ninth Ministerial Meeting of the Mediation and Security </p><p>Council, held on the margins of the AU summit in Durban. </p><p>(Both will be faxed to AF/W.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter stated that, since the allegations </p><p>were being made in the name of ECOWAS, it seemed to be </p><p>incumbent on ECOWAS to refute publicly the allegations now </p><p>being peddled anew by the GOL.  He also endorsed Diarra\'s </p><p>suggestion that ECOWAS write officially to member-state </p><p>governments that the ECOWAS Secretariat did not concur with </p><p>statements made in the report of the Military Mission to </p><p>Liberia alleging U.S./UK support and complicity with the </p><p>Lurd. The Ambassador also said that he would recommend that </p><p>the U.S. issue its own public statement denying the </p><p>allegations. General Diarra agreed to present our request to </p><p>Executive Secretary Chambas as soon as possible, and promised </p><p>to report the Executive Secretary\'s views as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Later on the evening of August 29, Ambassador spoke </p><p>with ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas, who is currently </p><p>traveling in Sweden.  It was agreed that the following steps </p><p>should be taken:(a)the U.S. should lodge a formal written </p><p>protest of the allegations made in the ECOWAS Military </p><p>Mission Report; (b) the ECOWAS Secretariat would circulate </p><p>the U.S. protest to all ECOWAS member-states; and (c) the </p><p>Secretariat would then issue a public statement acknowledging </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the U.S. protest and indicate that the official ECOWAS Report </p><p>on the Military Mission did not include subject allegations </p><p>against the U.S. and UK.  Chambas said the wording of the </p><p>ECOWAS public statement would be coordinated with the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Action Request:  Please provide the text of the protest </p><p>that the Embassy can then convey to the ECOWAS Secretariat, </p><p>in the form of a letter or diplomatic note. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
