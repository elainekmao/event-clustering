<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>NSC PASS TO ONDCP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SNAR, CA, KCRIM </p><p>SUBJECT: (C/NF) CANADA: A GOVERNMENT ADRIFT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 917 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Stephen R. Kelly. Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: Despite guarded optimism that the GOC </p><p>might try to "make amends" for its anti-U.S. handling of Iraq </p><p>policy, it has become increasingly apparent that the </p><p>government\'s behavior on Iraq was symptomatic of a much </p><p>deeper problem:  as in Baghdad, the leadership has gone </p><p>underground.  PM Chretien, once known for his iron-fisted </p><p>control of the Liberal Caucus, appears to have "lost his fast </p><p>ball." Since announcing his retirement in 2004, Chretien </p><p>increasingly has been detached from policymaking and the </p><p>business of governing, and more concerned about forcing </p><p>through "legacy" projects, regardless of their consequences. </p><p>Though this bodes ill for gaining Canadian cooperation on key </p><p>issues in the immediate term, we should continue to advance </p><p>our broad bilateral agenda through established channels with </p><p>an eye to the post-Chretien era. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) In a political system that vests so much power in </p><p>the office of the Prime Minister, the consequence of the PM\'s </p><p>decision to step down and his early disengagement from his </p><p>responsibilities -- a government in disarray -- seems </p><p>inevitable.  The unraveling of Canadian policymaking and </p><p>governance can be traced through a number of events in the </p><p>past 8 months. Beginning with reactions to the PM\'s startling </p><p>announcement (his own advisors didn\'t know), last September, </p><p>that Canada would ratify the Kyoto Protocol, to the current </p><p>confusion over missile defense and drug policy, GOC </p><p>decision-making has reflected the PM\'s gradual loss of </p><p>control--and thus his legendary ability to force policy--over </p><p>a restive Liberal House Caucus. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) Though the Caucus stood in unity with the Chretien </p><p>over his anti-war stance, many Members of Parliament voiced </p><p>misgivings, on and off the record, over the "handling" of </p><p>related Iraq issues and the government\'s waffling, bumptious </p><p>approach toward the U.S.  Since then, divisions within the </p><p>Caucus have deepened and grown, fueled in part by the kicking </p><p>into high gear of the three-way party leadership contest to </p><p>succeed Chretien.  The SARS crisis in Toronto precipitated </p><p>the "unsightly public spectacle" of infighting among Cabinet </p><p>ministers when Heritage Minister Sheila Copps and Health </p><p>Minister Anne McClellan got into a public spat over handling </p><p>of the SARS crisis.  McClellan also has taken issue with </p><p>Justice Minister Cauchon\'s marijuana decriminalization bill, </p><p>voicing strong concern that the new legislation would </p><p>increase marijuana use in Canada. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) With two-thirds of the House Liberal Caucus already </p><p>backing Chretien\'s political arch-rival, Paul Martin, for </p><p>leadership of the party, the Prime Minister\'s ability to </p><p>advance even his own limited agenda is quickly bogging down. </p><p>Emboldened MPs are pushing back on key legacy-related </p><p>legislation, including a bill to curb corporate and union </p><p>donations to political parties, and marijuana </p><p>decriminalization. Liberal Party leader Stephen LeDrew, an </p><p>acknowledged Martin supporter, has been leading the charge </p><p>against political contributions reform, and a number of </p><p>backbench MPs have begun to challenge the proposed </p><p>legislation publicly as well. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) With few carrots (the promise of "early summer </p><p>recess" doesn\'t really cut it) and no sticks (beyond the </p><p>empty threat of calling early elections) to force his </p><p>legislative program through the House of Commons, PM Chretien </p><p>is even less likely to take on really sticky issues such as </p><p>missile defense.  Hence last week\'s Cabinet non-decision on </p><p>whether to enter missile defense negotiations with the U.S. </p><p>should come as no surprise.  Notwithstanding the earnest--and </p><p>even forward-leaning by GOC standards--efforts of Foreign </p><p>Affairs and Defense Ministers Graham and McCallum to sell MD </p><p>to their peers in the House, the PM\'s complete lack of </p><p>presence on the issue has helped to amplify the voice of the </p><p>anti-military opposition and the "left wing" of the Liberal </p><p>Party and thus keep alive the debate. </p><p> </p><p>Consequences for the U.S. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>6. (C/NF) Chretien steadfastly maintains that he has no </p><p>intention of retiring sooner than his announced date of </p><p>February 2004, though his remaining at the helm of government </p><p>beyond the November 15 election of his successor will </p><p>compound the existing disarray in the GOC. Pressure for him </p><p>to step down early may increase as November 15 draws near, </p><p>potentially detracting further from the Fall legislative </p><p>agenda.  A number of pundits have reflected that matters </p><p>could "get worse" in September, when 85 percent of delegates </p><p>representing the Liberals\' 301 ridings are nominated and </p><p>declare their voting intentions (thereby "crowning" Paul </p><p>Martin ahead of schedule). While we anticipate little </p><p>improvement in GOC behavior or decision-making until Chretien </p><p>has gone, the extended "interregnum" period is an opportunity </p><p>to consolidate contacts with prospective members of the next </p><p>government. In the meantime, we should continue to advance </p><p>our broad bilateral agenda through established contacts and </p><p>institutions. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
