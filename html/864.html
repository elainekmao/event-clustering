</p>
<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADDIS ABABA 000531 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT, FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, ET </p><p>SUBJECT:  ETHIOPIA:  1996 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  96 STATE 223177 </p><p> </p><p>1. POST RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS, REFTEL, PARA 3 A-K: </p><p> </p><p>A. HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS FOR 1996:  1996 WAS A </p><p>YEAR OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC TERRORIST INCIDENTS </p><p>IN ETHIOPIA TO INCLUDE 3 HOTEL BOMBINGS, AN ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT ON A CABINET MINISTER, THE FATAL SHOOTINGS OF TWO </p><p>FOREIGN TOURISTS, AND AN AIRCRAFT HIJACKING AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT CRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED ARRESTS </p><p>FOR SUSPECTS IN ALL CASES EXCEPT THE HIJACKING.  THE </p><p>HIJACKERS WERE BELIEVED KILLED IN THE CRASH.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA </p><p>(GFDRE) IS STILL PREPARING CASES AGAINST THE DETAINEES IN </p><p>EACH OF THESE INSTANCES.  POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER </p><p>PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM DURING 1996. </p><p> </p><p>B. HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS FOR 1996:  POST IS </p><p>UNAWARE OF ANY SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS IN 1996.  THE GFDRE HAS FEW FORMAL </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS.  THE HIGHEST </p><p>PROFILE EXTRADITION EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS IS THE ONGOING </p><p>CASE FOR THE MUBARAK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECTS. </p><p>EXTRADITION HAS BEEN SOUGHT FOR THE SUSPECTS FROM SUDAN </p><p>AND THAT COUNTRY\'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE CONTRIBUTED TO A </p><p>SEVERE DOWNTURN IN RELATIONS BETWEEN ETHIOPIA AND SUDAN. </p><p>IN LATE 1995 INTO 1996, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO EXTRADITE </p><p>FROM UGANDA A SUSPECT IN THE ATTEMPTED SHOOTING OF A </p><p>USAID EMPLOYEE IN 1994.  UGANDAN AND ETHIOPIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES, COMMUNICATING THROUGH THEIR INTERPOL </p><p>OFFICES, ATTEMPTED TO WORK OUT AN INFORMAL EXTRADITION. </p><p>BECAUSE OF SEVERAL DELAYS ON BOTH SIDES IN EXCHANGING </p><p>INFORMATION, THE SUSPECT WAS CHARGED WITH LOCAL CRIMES IN </p><p>UGANDA, PAID A FINE AND WAS RELEASED.  THE GFDRE </p><p>INITIATED EXTRADITION DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>COMOROS ISLANDS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ETHIOPIAN </p><p>AIRLINES FLT 961 INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, THE IDENTIFICATION </p><p>OF THE DEAD HIJACKERS NEGATED THE NEED TO CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTIONS/EXTRADITIONS:  CURRENT </p><p>ETHIOPIAN LAWS DO NOT ADDRESS TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>SPECIFICALLY.  THE LACK OF EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., IS THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO PURSUIT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>D. OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES:  THE ETHIOPIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN QUICK TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. </p><p> </p><p>E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS FOR 1996:  GFDRE </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE CONDUCTED SEVERAL RAIDS ON SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORIST LOCATIONS IN ADDIS ABABA AND OTHER AREAS.  IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY FORCES CROSSED INTO </p><p>SOMALIA NEAR DOLO TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT FROM WHAT THE </p><p>GFDRE DESCRIBED AS A SUSPECTED TERRORIST TRAINING SITE </p><p>INSIDE SOMALIA FOR THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP AL- </p><p>ITIHAAD.  THE GDFRE FORCES THEN RETURNED TO THE BORDER TO </p><p>PROTECT THE BORDER CROSSING.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, </p><p>ETHIOPIAN SECURITY FORCES RAIDED SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN </p><p>DIRE DAWA, NAZARETH AND ADDIS ABABA, MAKING NUMEROUS </p><p>ARRESTS AND SEIZING AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF WEAPONS AND </p><p>EXPLOSIVES.  GFDRE AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED THE LOCATIONS </p><p>AS CELLS FOR THE AL-ITIHAAD GROUP AND CLAIM THAT THE </p><p>CELLS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPTS IN ETHIOPIA DURING 1996.  THE ETHIOPIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TRAINING AND EXPERTISE FROM </p><p>SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING THE U.S., TO HELP WITH THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR TERRORISM DETECTION, RESPONSE, AND </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE CAPABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>F. SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM: </p><p>SINCE THE DOWNFALL OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IN 1991, </p><p>THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA AND THE CURRENT </p><p>GFDRE HAVE BEEN STAUNCH OPPONENTS OF ALL FORMS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G. HOST GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM: </p><p>THE GFDRE HAS MADE NO STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>H. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE 1995 TO 1996:  THE </p><p>GFDRE PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED THE POSTURE THAT TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS WERE NOT AN ISSUE IN ETHIOPIA.  THE MUBARAK </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN 1995 AND INCIDENTS WHICH </p><p>OCCURRED IN 1996, TO INCLUDE THE MAJOR ONES MENTIONED IN </p><p>THIS REPORT, HAVE FOCUSSED GFDRE ATTENTION ON THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  THERE HAS BEEN A RECOGNITION THAT TERROR </p><p>INCIDENTS CAN BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT </p><p>THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP A CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND </p><p>COMBAT THE PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>I. U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS/INITIATIVES:  THE USG </p><p>HAS NOT HAD A NEED TO REQUEST SPECIFIC ACTION BY THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  THE USG </p><p>PROVIDED COUNTERTERRORISM TRAINING TO ETHIOPIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN 1995 AND 1996 ON A LIMITED BASIS.  THE </p><p>RISE IN SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS IN 1996 PROMPTED THE </p><p>EMBASSY TO SEEK ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE GFDRE ABILITY TO DETECT, DETER, AND </p><p>RESPOND. </p><p> </p><p>J. U.S. GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION, LAST 5 </p><p>YEARS:  THE USG HAS NOT HAD THE NEED TO FORMALLY SEEK </p><p>COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>   I) COOPERATION IN LEGAL PURSUIT OF SUSPECTS: </p><p>COOPERATION HERE HAS BEEN GOOD ON BOTH THE DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>OPERATIONAL LEVEL.  HOWEVER, THE LACK OF LAWS AND </p><p>TREATIES HAS HAMPERED THE COOPERATIVE PROCESS.  THE </p><p>ACTUAL NUMBER OF REQUESTS HAS BEEN LOW. </p><p> </p><p>  II) COOPERATION IN PREVENTING FUTURE ATTACKS:  THE </p><p>GFDRE HAS SHOWN A WILLINGNESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO </p><p>PROVIDE COOPERATION, WITHIN THEIR CAPABILITIES, FOR </p><p>POSSIBLE FUTURE ATTACKS AGAINST US PERSONNEL WITHIN </p><p>ETHIOPIA. </p><p> </p><p>K. EXTENT OF COOPERATION FOR PREVENTION OF ATTACKS, LAST </p><p>5 YEARS:  THE USG HAS NOT HAD THE NEED TO REQUEST </p><p>COOPERATION FROM ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE PREVENTION </p><p>OF A SPECIFIC ACT OF TERRORISM DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHINN </p><p></p></div>
