<p>S E C R E T STATE 062472 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: GHAURI FLIGHT TEST </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY KARL F. INDERFURTH, ASSISTANT SECRETARY. </p><p>REASON: 1.5  (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY. A/S INDERFURTH EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT AT </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S FLIGHT TEST OF ITS GHAURI MISSILE, AND CONCERN </p><p>AT ITS POSSIBLE IMPACT ON RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH INDIA. </p><p>HE URGED PAKISTAN TO CONVEY DIRECTLY TO THE NEW INDIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ITS POSITION THAT THE TEST WAS NOT A REACT TON TO </p><p>THE NEW BJP GOVERNMENT AND ITS PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE </p><p>"NUCLEAR OPTION." HE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE USG HAS </p><p>BEEN EVALUATING THE POSSIBLE REQUIREMENT TO IMPOSE US </p><p>MISSILE SANCTIONS FOR IMPORTS RELATED TO THE GHAURI. IN </p><p>PARA 8 ARE POINTS EMBASSY ISLAMABAD SHOULD MAKE ON THE </p><p>GHAURI MISSILE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE. SEE PARA 8. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AFTER PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR KHOKHAR ON APRIL 6 TOLD </p><p>A/S INDERFURTH APRIL 6 OF THE RELEASE OF DEA EMPLOYEE AYYAZ </p><p>BALUCH  (SEPTEL), HE HANDED OVER THE GOP PRESS RELEASE ON </p><p>THE FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI MISSILE EARLIER THAT DAY. </p><p>INDERFURTH TOLD KHOKHAR THAT WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>PAKISTAN HAD FELT IT NECESSARY TO TAKE THIS ACTION. HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT WE HAVE BEEN URGING BOTH INDIA AND </p><p>PAKISTAN TO REFRAIN FROM ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD BE SEEN BY </p><p>THE OTHER AS PROVOCATIVE.   HE EXPRESSED CONCERN AT HOW </p><p>THIS WOULD AFFECT THE RESUMPTION OF THE INDO-PAKISTANI </p><p>DIALOGUE AND THE PROGRESS THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD MAKE IN </p><p>IMPROVING RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) INDERFURTH SAID THAT WE WOULD URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>INDIA NOT TO REACT.   HE ADDED THAT WE ALSO HOPE, NOW THAT </p><p>PAKISTAN HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS CAPABILITY, THAT IT WOULD NOW </p><p>REFRAIN FROM ANY FURTHER SUCH TESTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) KHOKHAR SAID,  IN REFERENCE TO INDO-PAKISTANI </p><p>RELATIONS, THAT PM NAWAZ SHARIF\'S LETTER TO INCOMING PM </p><p>VAJPAYEE WAS VERY UPBEAT.  HE ADDED THAT THE FLIGHT TEST </p><p>HAD BEEN "IN THE PIPELINE" AND WAS NOT A REACTION TO THE </p><p>NEW BJP GOVERNMENT IN DELHI. WHEN CHALLENGED WHETHER THE </p><p>GOP HAD MADE THIS POINT DIRECTLY TO INDIA, KHOKHAR CLAIMED </p><p>THAT PAKISTAN DID NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>INDIA.   INDERFURTH STRONGLY ENCOURAGED PAKISTAN TO SEND A </p><p>REASSURING MESSAGE TO VAJPAYEE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) INDERFURTH NOTED THAT THE GOP PRESS RELEASE HAD </p><p>REFERRED TO THE GHAURI AS AN INDIGENOUS PROGRAM, AND STATED </p><p>OUR VIEW THAT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY INDIGENOUS. HE POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT AMBASSADOR SIMONS HAD RAISED PREVIOUSLY WITH THE </p><p>GOP (NOTE: DECEMBER 24 WITH COAS KARAMAT, FEBRUARY 10 WITH </p><p>FONSEC AHMED, AND FEBRUARY 24 WITH ANWAR ZAHID) OUR </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>RELATED TO THE GHAURI. THIS, HE SAID, RAISES THE SPECTRE </p><p>OF SANCTIONABLE ACTIVITY.  HE SAID THAT THE USG IS AT THE </p><p>LATE STAGE OF OUR REVIEW OF THE APPLICABILITY OF MISSILE </p><p>SANCTIONS UNDER US LAW, AND STRESSED THAT THIS REVIEW </p><p>PREDATES THE GHAURI FLIGHT TEST. HE ASKED KHOKHAR TO </p><p>PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THE GOP COULD PROVIDE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) INDERFURTH TURNED TO THE PAKISTANI LETTERS TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY LAST WEEK ON SOUTH ASIAN </p><p>SECURITY. HE SAID THAT IT IS THE USG VIEW THAT THE GOL </p><p>LANGUAGE (ON THE "OPTION TO INDUCT NUCLEAR WEAPONS") THAT </p><p>PAKISTAN FOUND SO DISTURBING DID NOT SUGGEST A NEW </p><p>THRESHOLD HAD BEEN CROSSED. HE STRESSED THAT WE HAD BEEN </p><p>STRONGLY URGING THE GOL NOT TO PROCEED IN THIS DIRECTION. </p><p>WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING PAKISTAN\'S RIGHT TO TAKE ACTIONS BASED </p><p>ON THEIR OWN SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE </p><p>THAT ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN BOTH CAPITALS DO NOT RESULT IN </p><p>DESTABILIZING THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY SHOULD FOLLOW UP THIS </p><p>DISCUSSION ON OUR REACTION TO THE MISSILE TEST AND ON THE </p><p>PENDING ISSUE OF US MISSILE SANCTIONS, EMBASSY SHOULD MAKE </p><p>THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO APPROPRIATE GOP COUNTERPARTS (I.E., </p><p>THOSE WITH WHOM THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ON PREVIOUS </p><p>OCCASIONS) : </p><p> </p><p>-- IN SECRETARY ALBRIGHT\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, SHE MADE VERY CLEAR OUR VIEWS REGARDING A FLIGHT </p><p>TEST IN THIS TIME FRAME. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE PARTICULARLY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED AND REGRET THAT PAKISTAN FELT IT NECESSARY TO </p><p>CONDUCT THE GHAURI FLIGHT TEST NOW. AS YOU KNOW, WE </p><p>BELIEVE BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN SHOULD REFRAIN FROM ACTIONS </p><p>THE OTHER COUNTRY WOULD FIND PROVOCATIVE. THIS IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL IF THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS </p><p>AND MAKE PROGRESS IN IMPROVING RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WELCOME THE CORDIAL TONE OF PM SHARIF\'S LETTER TO THE </p><p>INCOMING INDIAN PM. BUT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, </p><p>AND THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR PAKISTANI ACTION SINCE THE </p><p>SWEARING-IN OF THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE ADVISED THE INDIANS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF </p><p>THEIR OWN PREVIOUS MISSILE TESTS, NOT TO OVER-REACT TO </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S FLIGHT TEST. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTACT THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA </p><p>DIRECTLY, AT A HIGH LEVEL, TO ALLAY ANY CONCERNS IT MAY </p><p>HAVE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF YOUR GHAURI TEST. </p><p> </p><p>-- SIMILARLY, NOW THAT PAKISTAN HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS </p><p>CAPABILITY, WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL REFRAIN FROM FURTHER SUCH </p><p>TESTS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO HEIGHTENED </p><p>TENSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS AMBASSADOR SIMONS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WITH YOU, THE </p><p>USG HAS BEEN REVIEWING FOR SOME TIME WHETHER ACTIVITIES BY </p><p>A PAKISTANI ENTITY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION FROM FOREIGN </p><p>SOURCES OF MTCR CATEGORY I MISSILES AND RELATED EQUIPMENT </p><p>AND TECHNOLOGY REQUIRE THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS UNDER US </p><p>MISSILE SANCTIONS LAWS. WE ARE NEARING COMPLETION OF THE </p><p>SANCTIONS REVIEW PROCESS IN THIS CASE AND EXPECT TO MAKE A </p><p>DECISION SOON. </p><p> </p><p>-- I WANT TO STRESS THAT ANY SANCTIONS WOULD NOT BE </p><p>TRIGGERED BY THE FLIGHT TEST, BUT BY THE ACQUISITION OF THE </p><p>MISSILE AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
