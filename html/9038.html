<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, MOPS, PGOV, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER ASKS FOR TIME TO CONSIDER ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez told the </p><p>Ambassador on June 24 that the MFA is seeking interagency </p><p>comments on the proposed bilateral Article 98 Agreement, and </p><p>is engaged in internal political consultations on the </p><p>desirability of signing the agreement.  He asked that we give </p><p>the MFA until mid-July to come up with a coordinated GOG </p><p>position on an Article 98 Agreement before seeking bilateral </p><p>consultations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador met on June 24 with Foreign Minister </p><p>Edgar Gutierrez to offer, inter alia, that a USG negotiating </p><p>team meet with senior MFA officials on June 27 to discuss the </p><p>status of the USG proposal for a bilateral Article 98 </p><p>Agreement.  The Ambassador noted the priority the US attaches </p><p>to signing an agreement with Guatemala, particularly in view </p><p>of the large number of humanitarian joint exercises carried </p><p>out every year in Guatemala.  The Ambassador told Gutierrez </p><p>that, although Guatemala has not yet ratified the Statute of </p><p>Rome, the lack of guarantees for US military personnel </p><p>created by the absence of an Article 98 Agreement will be a </p><p>disincentive for continuing humanitarian exercises at the </p><p>levels of previous years.  Foreign Minister Gutierrez said </p><p>the GOG fully recognizes the importance of this issue, and </p><p>said he had had a positive meeting on the USG proposal with </p><p>A/S Rademaker on the margins of the OASGA in Santiago.  He </p><p>thanked us for the counter-proposal given to him by A/S </p><p>Rademaker, and said that the MFA\'s legal division had already </p><p>sent the draft around to other ministries for their comments. </p><p> Gutierrez said the MFA was disappointed that the U.S. had </p><p>not accepted an operative paragraph counter-proposed by the </p><p>GOG, but said the MFA Treaty Office is producing an </p><p>evaluation of the current proposal.  Gutierrez said that he </p><p>had tasked Ambassador Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, his special </p><p>advisor, with ensuring that the MFA and other ministries </p><p>complete their review of the proposal expeditiously. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Gutierrez said that, besides the technical/legal </p><p>review of the current text, he was also engaged in a round of </p><p>political consultations on the matter more generally.  The </p><p>Foreign Minister pointed out that he had been a member of the </p><p>historical clarification commission which had fingered </p><p>General Rios Montt for human rights violations during the </p><p>internal conflict.  His subsequent decision to join the FRG </p><p>government (note: Rios Montt is the Secretary General of the </p><p>FRG. End note) had come as a big shock to the human rights </p><p>community.  He said, "if now I am perceived as the one who is </p><p>pushing an international agreement that could protect Rios </p><p>Montt from international justice, I will have lost all </p><p>credibility."  The Ambassador pointed out that the ICC will </p><p>have no jurisdiction over Rios Montt as there is no </p><p>retroactivity in its actions.  Gutierrez acknowledged the </p><p>point, but said human rights groups in Guatemala are not </p><p>convinced.  Gutierrez said he has begun a consultation with </p><p>the leading human rights groups and others to form a more </p><p>educated position on an Article 98 Agreement.  He said that </p><p>he was departing for a two week visit to European capitals </p><p>and would be back in Guatemala by mid-July.  He believes that </p><p>by that time the GOG will be prepared to discuss an Article </p><p>98 Agreement more formally.  Gutierrez asked if we could give </p><p>him until then to revisit the issue. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  Foreign Minister Gutierrez recognizes that </p><p>securing an Article 98 Agreement is one of the USG\'s highest </p><p>priorities in Guatemala at this time.  He is also aware that, </p><p>even absent Guatemala\'s accession to the Statute of Rome, the </p><p>lack of an Article 98 Agreement could have consequences for </p><p>our military-to-military relationship.  When Gutierrez </p><p>returns from Europe in mid-July we will broach the issue with </p><p>him again. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
