<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, ASEC, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE INCITES BRUTALIZATION OF MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 591 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 2002 HARARE 2529 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) In the wake of the successful March 18 - 19 MDC </p><p>stayaway the GOZ has embarked on a massive retribution </p><p>campaign against lower-level MDC officials, and some MDC MPs. </p><p> Police, suspected CIO officers and soldiers have arrested, </p><p>beaten, raped and tortured several hundred MDC supporters. </p><p>The GOZ\'s brutalization of Zimbabweans appears targeted at </p><p>local MDC officials and was incited by President Mugabe, who </p><p>gave a vitriolic speech on March 21 in which he threatened a </p><p>crackdown on the MDC.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Hundreds Seek Medical Attention </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) According to medical Dr. Frances Lovemore of Amani </p><p>Trust, a local human rights NGO, over 250 people have sought </p><p>medical attention at the Avenues Clinic alone in Harare for </p><p>injuries sustained in political violence from March 19 - 24. </p><p>Most of the injuries were soft-tissue bruises and cuts from </p><p>beatings.  There were also cases of acid burns, two reported </p><p>rapes and three submissions to electric shock torture; one </p><p>death has been reported (Ref A).  According to the MDC, 83 </p><p>people had sought medical attention from its social welfare </p><p>office by March 21 (Ref A), and another 50 from March 22 - 24. </p><p> </p><p>Soldiers Leading the Charge </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>3. (U) According to victims\' accounts, almost all of the </p><p>incidents were perpetrated by groups of persons in Zimbabwe </p><p>Defense Forces (ZDF) uniforms with official insignia, </p><p>traveling in military personnel carriers, and some armed with </p><p>AK-47 assault rifles.  In most cases the perpetrators arrived </p><p>in the middle of the night to abduct and or beat local MDC </p><p>officials and their families.  MDC officials believe some of </p><p>the uniformed persons are actually GOZ National Youth Service </p><p>members (called "green bombers" for their green uniforms) who </p><p>have been given military uniforms and equipment, but are </p><p>operating under orders from military officers.  The </p><p>government-owned The Herald reported that 160 MDC members had </p><p>been arrested around the country for perpetrating violence </p><p>during the stayaway. </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe Calls for Crackdown on MDC, </p><p>Blames West for Violence </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>4. (U) The upsurge in officially sponsored violence comes in </p><p>the aftermath of recent statements by President Mugabe vowing </p><p>greater action against the opposition MDC.  At the funeral of </p><p>former Minister of Higher Education, Swithun Mombeshora, on </p><p>March 21 at the National Heroes\' Acre outside Harare, Mugabe </p><p>said, "we shall not treat them (the MDC) with soft gloves </p><p>anymore."  He said when freedom of expression was used to </p><p>promote violence and terrorism, it should be curbed and those </p><p>who promote the violence must be severely punished.  He went </p><p>on to say that if Hitler fought for the freedom, justice and </p><p>sovereignty of his people he (Mugabe) could be a black Hitler </p><p>"ten-fold".  He accused Western nations, specifically the </p><p>U.S., U.K, Netherlands and Germany, of paying the MDC to </p><p>engage in violence. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Following accounts were derived from Embassy </p><p>Officer interviews with some of the victims: </p><p> </p><p>Retired Military Officer Tortured </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) On March 21 in the middle of the night two persons in </p><p>military uniform and insignia, herewith "soldiers", armed </p><p>with AK-47s, and six suspected CIO officers abducted Elias </p><p>(David) Shamu, a retired military armory officer, from his </p><p>home in the Harare suburb of Mufakose.  Shamu had been </p><p>threatened on numerous occasions and has attempted to conceal </p><p>his military background.  GOZ authorities believe Shamu might </p><p>pass sensitive military information to the MDC through his </p><p>wife, Viola Shamu, who is an MDC councilor in Harare.  Shamu </p><p>denies the claim or any personal involvement with the MDC. </p><p>Shamu, who at first did not tell Poloff his real name, </p><p>previously guided Poloff and a UN official to visit </p><p>ex-commercial farm workers and was beaten when war vets </p><p>detained the entire party at a commercial farm in Melfort in </p><p>November (Ref B).  During the abduction on March 21 the </p><p>soldiers and CIO officers beat Shamu\'s eleven and fourteen </p><p>year old boys and 27-year-old cousin with sjamboks (rubber </p><p>whips cut from car tires), and batons. </p><p>7. (C) The CIO officers blindfolded Shamu, took him to an </p><p>undisclosed location, and subjected him to electric shock </p><p>torture administered to his fingers, toes and genitals. </p><p>Three suspected CIO officers told him to open his mouth while </p><p>they urinated into it accusing him of giving away sensitive </p><p>information to the MDC.  Shamu was dumped unconscious, bound </p><p>and blindfolded into a vacant field in Msasa near Harare at </p><p>10 p.m. on March 21 where he awoke, unbound himself, and </p><p>flagged down a passing car for assistance.  He was badly </p><p>bruised, scarred, and cut over his face and entire body, and </p><p>afraid of talking when Poloff interviewed him at Avenues </p><p>Clinic on March 23. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Mabvuku Officials Beaten </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) On March 22 approximately five soldiers beat severely </p><p>the MDC\'s chairwoman for women\'s issues for Mabvuku (a </p><p>high-density suburb of Harare), her brother who is an MDC </p><p>youth member, and their 55-year-old mother at their home in </p><p>the Harare high-density suburb Mabvuku.  According to the </p><p>brother, Crispin, about fifty soldiers arrived in the middle </p><p>of the night and five beat them with batons particularly on </p><p>the bottoms of their feet, and kicked them repeatedly.  The </p><p>soldiers told the mother, who was naked when the soldiers </p><p>arrived, to spread her legs; one of them inserted the barrel </p><p>of an AK-47 assault rifle into her private parts while her </p><p>children looked on.  Polchief interviewed the three at the </p><p>Avenues Medical Clinic on March 23 and found them cut and </p><p>bruised over their faces, backs, arms, legs and other areas. </p><p>Crispin was unable to sit up on his own, his sister was </p><p>traumatized, and his mother was reportedly suicidal.  The </p><p>sister\'s wrists were swollen severely, possibly broken. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) On approximately March 22 five soldiers arrived in the </p><p>middle of the night at the home of the secretary for the MDC </p><p>offices in Mabvuku.  She told the Defense Attache that the </p><p>soldiers beat her, one raped her, and they forced her to </p><p>drink her son\'s urine. They also accused her of associating </p><p>with Amani Trust, and demanded information about the </p><p>operations of the MDC office including whether the MDC had </p><p>received USG funding. </p><p> </p><p>Violence Close to Embassy Homes </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>10. (U) On March 22, Sharon Nell a 50-year old veterinary </p><p>nurse in the low-density Harare suburb of Highlands, where </p><p>many Embassy families live, came home to find five soldiers </p><p>in her bedroom.  One of them said, "let\'s rape this white </p><p>bitch"; they forced her to strip naked, pushed her around the </p><p>room, and beat her severely with leather straps.  She didn\'t </p><p>know whether she passed out or went into shock.  When Nell </p><p>reported the incident to police, they suggested she report </p><p>that "youths" were the perpetrators in order to avoid CIO </p><p>harassment.  She was visibly bruised and shaken up when </p><p>Polchief interviewed her at Avenues clinic on March 23. </p><p>Though a veterinary nurse, Nell had offered to treat victims </p><p>of violence in the wake of the stayaway.  After transferring </p><p>to another hospital on March 24, Nell received a threatening </p><p>phone call on her direct line in her room warning her against </p><p>continuing to tell her story. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Councilor Abducted / Beaten </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>11. (U) On March 20 in the middle of the night, soldiers and </p><p>suspected CIO officers abducted Murewa South city councilor </p><p>and MDC local chairman Raphinas Madzokere from his home in </p><p>Chitungwiza (a high-density suburb of Harare).  The soldiers </p><p>took Madzokere\'s liberation war veteran\'s identity card, and </p><p>MDC materials, beat him severely and then dumped him </p><p>unconscious near his home on March 21.  Three soldiers </p><p>returned to the house on March 22 and threatened the family </p><p>with death.  Madzokere was living in Chitungwiza because </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters had destroyed his home in Murewa last year. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Chinhoyi Leadership Beaten </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>12. (U) On March 20 unknown assailants burned the Chinoyi </p><p>offices of the General Agriculture and Plantation Worker\'s </p><p>Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) to the ground.  Also in Chinhoyi </p><p>unknown assailants burnt to the ground the ZANU-PF offices. </p><p>In response to the latter, police arrested the entire </p><p>Chinhoyi local MDC leadership, about twelve people, and beat </p><p>them severely.  They were still in custody on March 24 </p><p>although no evidence has yet been released linking the MDC to </p><p>the fire. </p><p> </p><p>Police Cancel MDC Rally, Beat Attendees </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>13. (U) On March 23 riot police beat numerous MDC supporters </p><p>who had arrived for a scheduled MDC rally in Kuwadzana.  Two </p><p>days earlier Police had requested that MDC officials </p><p>reschedule the rally to March 22 saying that President Mugabe </p><p>would be speaking at a ZANU-PF rally in Kuwadzana on March </p><p>23.  Having already made arrangements the MDC refused, and </p><p>the police prevented the rally by force; in the end Mugabe </p><p>did not address a rally in Kuwadzana on March 23. </p><p> </p><p>Harare MDC Mayor Threatened </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>14. (U) On March 21 a mob of approximately 100 ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters threatened Harare\'s MDC Mayor Elias Mudzuri </p><p>chanting "you are a murderer and you will also be killed," as </p><p>he walked to his car following a funeral ceremony at Heroes\' </p><p>Acre in full view of senior GOZ officials and police.  They </p><p>confiscated the keys to Mudzuri\'s official vehicle; Mudzuri </p><p>secured a spare set and returned home with a police escort </p><p>but he continues to receive threats. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>15. (C) Although a GOZ campaign of retribution in the </p><p>aftermath of the stayaway was already underway, President </p><p>Mugabe\'s March 21 speech intensified the brutalization of MDC </p><p>officials and supporters.  It is also clear that the security </p><p>forces are either directly involved or, at a minimum, </p><p>complicit in the ongoing GOZ crackdown.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
