<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000893 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, OVIP, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS SEND LETTER TO AMERICANS ON PM\'S VISIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Local media outlets received by e-mail the afternoon </p><p>of May 7 a letter from the International Department of </p><p>the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) addressed "To Our </p><p>Friends in America."  A copy of the letter has been </p><p>faxed to SA/INS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The three-page letter, written in turgid but </p><p>grammatically correct English, is dated May 6--the day </p><p>of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s arrival in </p><p>Washington.  Its release by e-mail the following day may </p><p>have been timed to coincide with the PM\'s May 7 call on </p><p>President Bush in the Oval Office.  The letter warns </p><p>readers that Deuba\'s true motive is "to beg for massive </p><p>US military and financial assistance to crush the </p><p>popular people\'s democratic movement."  Since Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s January visit to Nepal "the US administration </p><p>has been systematically building the case for a massive </p><p>armed intervention and creation of a permanent military </p><p>base in Nepal (apparently to take on China and India in </p><p>the long run)."  The real purpose of Deuba\'s visit, the </p><p>letter charges, is "to formally initiate a long term US </p><p>military engagement in Nepal." </p><p> </p><p>3.  The text compares Maoist demands for formation of an </p><p>interim government, a constituent assembly, and a </p><p>republic to the "common demands of every bourgeois </p><p>democratic revolution, from Europe to Americas to </p><p>anywhere."  Contrary to Government propaganda, the </p><p>Maoists do not intend to impose a one-party </p><p>dictatorship, the letter continues, but will instead </p><p>guarantee the freedom to contest elections to all </p><p>political parties.  Recalling Prachanda\'s May 1 </p><p>statement on the possibility of future dialogue, the </p><p>letter asks why Deuba is seeking foreign military </p><p>assistance when "all the parliamentary political parties </p><p>and civil society" are calling for a negotiated </p><p>political settlement.  The success of the April 23-27 </p><p>general strike attests to the popularity of the Maoist </p><p>movement, the letter claims, adding that the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army has "been thoroughly defeated in every real </p><p>encounter" with the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In the closing paragraphs the letter calls upon </p><p>"class brothers and sisters in the USA, the most </p><p>powerful and dangerous imperialist power on earth" to </p><p>foment "revolution in the belly of the beast and stop it </p><p>from intervening in the revolutionary processes </p><p>elsewhere." </p><p> </p><p>5.  A local journalist who has previously received </p><p>English e-mail transmissions from the Maoists\' second- </p><p>highest leader, Baburam Bhattarai, said he saw some </p><p>similarities in the style and fluency in English of this </p><p>letter.  He noted that the letter made no reference to </p><p>the Maoists\' apparently stunning defeat in Rolpa over </p><p>the past week (May 2-6).  He said he could not tell from </p><p>where the message had been sent or who the other </p><p>addressees were. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment: Even the mainstream local press and some </p><p>prominent national politicians have been engaged in wild </p><p>speculation recently about USG military aims in Nepal. </p><p>The Maoists may thus have calculated that their </p><p>accusations regarding ulterior US goals might resonate </p><p>with local audiences.  Deuba\'s success in securing the </p><p>May 7 Oval Office appointment has piqued and irritated </p><p>many of his political rivals; the Maoists apparently are </p><p>also worried.  The length of this letter--one of the </p><p>more comprehensive recent efforts by the Maoists to </p><p>explain and justify themselves--and its emphasis on the </p><p>their purported willingness to resume dialogue may </p><p>indicate just how worried they are. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
