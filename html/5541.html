(C) CROATIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS NATO ASPIRATIONS AND HAS </p><p>BECOME A NET CONTRIBUTOR TO SECURITY IN THE REGION.  BUT </p><p>CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MUST FIRST IDENTIFY AS A </p><p>NATIONAL PRIORITY AND THEN ALLOCATE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES NEEDED IN THE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY AND THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES.  IT MUST ALSO BEGIN </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL ISSUES </p><p>ADDRESSED IN ITS RECENT NATO REVIEW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.

(C) THE FORMAL STRUCTURE OF THE BDC CONSISTED OF AN </p><p>OPENING PLENARY SESSION FOLLOWED BY THREE WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETINGS TO FOCUS ON KEY ISSUES OF BILATERAL CONCERN.  IN HER </p><p>OPENING STATEMENT, DASD RICARDEL RECOGNIZED CROATIA\'S </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHTING THE </p><p>INTERDICTION OF THE M/V BOKA STAR, THE CONTRIBUTION OF </p><p>WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY AND THE </p><p>IMMINENT DEPLOYMENT OF A MILITARY POLICE PLATOON TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN IN SUPPORT OF ISAF.

THE MOD </p><p>HOPES TO REPLICATE THIS PRACTICE FOR OTHER PEACE SUPPORT </p><p>OPERATIONS AND FOR FUNDING DEFENSE REFORMS LIKE DOWNSIZING, </p><p>WHICH ARE FAR BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE MOD\'S BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>WORKING GROUPS PRODUCE CONCRETE RESULTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE THREE WORKING GROUPS DISCUSSED THE BROAD RANGE OF </p><p>ISSUES RELATING TO U.S. - CROATIA BILATERAL DEFENSE </p><p>RELATIONS.  FOLLOWING SUBSTANTIVE PRESENTATIONS OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>REFORM PLANS, U.S. PARTICIPANTS PROPOSED SEVERAL CONCRETE </p><p>AREAS WHERE USG EXPERIENCE AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE </p><p>ABLE TO HELP ACHIEVE MOD GOALS.  WORKING GROUPS REVIEWED </p><p>CROATIA\'S PROGRESS IN NATO\'S MAP PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE USE </p><p>OF U.S. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S DEFENSE REFORM, </p><p>MODERNIZATION AND TRAINING GOALS, AND BORDER SECURITY AND </p><p>COUNTER-PROLIFERATION.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WORKING </p><p>GROUPS AGREED: </p><p> </p><p>- TO FORM AN INFORMAL BILATERAL LEGAL WORKING GROUP BETWEEN </p><p>EUCOM AND CROATIAN MOD EXPERTS (AUGMENTED AS NECESSARY) TO </p><p>MOVE QUICKLY TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING IMPEDIMENTS TO MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION, AND </p><p> </p><p>- THAT THE GOC WOULD FORM A JOINT CIVILIAN-MILITARY </p><p>INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ADDRESS EXPORT CONTROL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  02 OF 05  060851Z </p><p>BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.

(C) IN A MEETING WITH DASD RICARDEL AND THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>PM RACAN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HOW CROATIA\'S PROGRESS ON </p><p>REFORMS  MAKES IT A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR INTEGRATION INTO </p><p>EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  DESPITE THE INTRA-COALITION </p><p>BRINKSMANSHIP THAT SO OFTEN CROWDS THE HEADLINES, RACAN SAID </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT IS STABLE AND WILL SERVE OUT ITS FULL TERM. </p><p>COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM HAS PRODUCED DURABLE RESULTS, </p><p>THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION IS STABLE, GDP GROWTH IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO REACH 5 PERCENT THIS YEAR, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>DECREASING FOR THE PAST TEN MONTHS.  RACAN STATED THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SLACK OFF THE PACE OF REFORMS IN ITS LAST </p><p>YEAR, AND PLEDGED HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>WITH REFORMS IN THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ACCORDING TO RACAN, CROATIA IS SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>ADDRESSING THE POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF NATO AND THE EU.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED CROATIA SHOULD HAVE "SOLVED" THE PROBLEM OF MINORITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00284  02 OF 05  060851Z </p><p>RIGHTS WITH PASSAGE OF A PROGRESSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON </p><p>NATIONAL MINORITIES, BUT ADMITTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS </p><p>INCOMPLETE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  RACAN DEFENDED GOC ACTION ON </p><p>REFUGEE RETURN; CROATIA\'S POST-WAR "ETHNIC MOSAIC" WILL NEVER </p><p>BE THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE 1991, BUT THE GOC IS COMMITTED </p><p>TO SUPPORTING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO COME BACK. </p><p>FULLY 100,000 HAVE ALREADY RETURNED SINCE 2000, HE EXPECTS </p><p>ANOTHER 20,000 WILL SEEK TO RETURN IN 2003.  THE GOC HAS </p><p>COMMITTED 300 MILLION EUROS IN ITS 2003 BUDGET TO </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION AND RETURN; ALL THOSE WHO FORMALLY EXPRESSED A </p><p>DESIRE TO RETURN TO CROATIA BY THE END OF 2002 WILL BE </p><p>ACCOMMODATED BY THE END OF 2003, RACAN CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) RACAN TOUTED CROATIA\'S STRONG RECORD OF REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION AND SAID THE GOC WAS STRONGLY INCLINED TO LIFT </p><p>ITS VISA REQUIREMENT FOR CITIZENS OF YUGOSLAVIA, THOUGH THIS </p><p>WAS POLITICALLY QUITE SENSITIVE.  HE REMARKED THAT SUCH </p><p>CROATIAN LIBERALIZATION WOULD, IRONICALLY, COME JUST AS </p><p>HUNGARY IMPOSES A VISA REQUIREMENT ON THE FRY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ON CROATIA\'S RELATIONS WITH ICTY, RACAN ASSERTED </p><p>THAT CROATIA IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO CLOSE COOPERATION HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY ITS </p><p>APPROACH TO THE BOBETKO CASE.  FIRST, THE VERY PUBLIC </p><p>DISCUSSION OF HOW LACK OF COOPERATION WITH ICTY WOULD AFFECT </p><p>CROATIA\'S CHANCES TO ENTER THE EU AND NATO HAVE SHORED UP </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9118 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      DTC-00   EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------31C22A  060852Z /38 </p><p>O 060830Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9401 </p><p>INFO JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 ZAGREB 000284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SCE </p><p>SECDEF FOR DASD EURASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MARR, MCAP, MASS, NATO, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: DASD RICARDEL LEADS BILATERAL DEFENSE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN CROATIA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE GOC POSITION,  SECOND, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S ATTEMPTS TO DESTABILIZE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>SCENE FAILED, AND THIRD, CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED </p><p>THAT ICTY IS THE COURT OF JURISDICTION FOR ALL FUTURE </p><p>APPEALS, CUTTING OFF OPPOSITION LEGAL MANEUVERS.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT ICTY IS NOW "OFF OF THE EU AGENDA," AND HIS UPCOMING </p><p>VISIT TO THE UK WILL TAKE PLACE IN THAT CONTEXT.  RACAN ADDED </p><p>THAT WITH THE BOBETKO CASE SOON TO REACH FINAL RESOLUTION, </p><p>"NOW GOTOVINA HAS BECOME TOPICAL," BUT HE STRESSED THAT </p><p>"CROATIA WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE BY GENERAL GOTOVINA." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) AS IN ALL HER BILATERAL MEETINGS, DASD RICARDEL </p><p>THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS SUPPORT TO AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE </p><p>GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  WITH RACAN, SHE ALSO LAID DOWN A </p><p>MARKER FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REQUESTS FOR LANDING RIGHTS AND </p><p>TRANSIT OF U.S. PERSONNEL EN ROUTE TO THE MIDDLE EAST REGION </p><p>FOR MOVEMENT OF FORCES RELATED TO IRAQ; WHILE HE MADE NO </p><p>COMMITMENTS, HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT SUCH REQUESTS WOULD </p><p>BE FAVORABLY REVIEWED.  DASD RICARDEL TOLD RACAN THAT SHE HAD </p><p>GIVEN THE BDC PLENARY SESSION A BLUNT BRIEFING ON THE THREATS </p><p>OF PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION; THE USG </p><p>APPRECIATES PAST GOC SUPPORT IN REFRAINING FROM SALES OF </p><p>WEAPONS OR DUAL-USE ITEMS TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM AND </p><p>URGED CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO THIS POLICY OF NOT SELLING </p><p>WEAPONS TO LIBYA AND SIMILAR STATES. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) RICARDEL PRESSED RACAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEFENSE </p><p>REFORMS AND EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFICULT ROAD </p><p>AHEAD; THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO ASSIST WHERE IT CAN. </p><p>RICARDEL SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S </p><p>RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AS IT MAKES ITS BID FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z </p><p>AND URGED RACAN TO SUPPORT THE REFORMS IDENTIFIED IN THE MAP </p><p>ANP REVIEW PROCESS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY ISSUES LIKE REFUGEE RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) DASD RICARDEL TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE OF THE USG\'S </p><p>OUTSTANDING REQUEST TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>CROATIA.  SHE EXPLAINED U.S. LEGISLATION MAKING PROVISION OF </p><p>MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ALL NON-NATO STATES CONTINGENT ON </p><p>SIGNING SUCH AN AGREEMENT BY JULY 1, 2003; USG MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR CROATIA TO ACHIEVE ITS </p><p>MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY GOALS.  RACAN EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT CROATIA IS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE EU\'S INSISTENCE THAT </p><p>CANDIDATES TOE THE EU LINE AND THE USG\'S INSISTENCE ON AN CIC </p><p>EXEMPTION.  HE CONTINUES TO WAIT FOR A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM </p><p>BRUSSELS BEFORE MOVING FORWARD.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD RACAN </p><p>THAT USG-EU DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE, BUT THE EU HAS ALREADY </p><p>STATED IT DOES NOT OBJECT TO ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS, BUT HAS </p><p>SIMPLY SET A LIST OF CRITERIA WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. </p><p>STRESSING THE APPROACHING DEADLINE UNDER U.S. LEGISLATION, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO RACAN THAT THE GOC EVENTUALLY </p><p>MAY HAVE TO DECIDE BASED ON CROATIA\'S GOALS AND NEEDS, NOT </p><p>THOSE OF THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC: CROATIA WILL CONTINUE DIFFICULT REFORMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) DASD RICARDEL THANKED PRESIDENT MESIC FOR HIS MORAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP ON REFORM ISSUES AND FOR HIS INSISTENCE THAT </p><p>CROATIA MUST CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE HAGUE.  SHE URGED </p><p>THAT HE LEND HIS LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF THE ISSUE OF </p><p>DEFENSE DOWNSIZING AND RESTRUCTURING.

HE PLEDGED CROATIA\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WITH NECESSARY REFORMS, BUT EXPLAINED </p><p>THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN WHICH THE MOD </p><p>MUST CARRY OUT DOWNSIZING EFFORTS.  MESIC HAILED THE USG </p><p>COMMITMENT TO ASSIST CROATIA TO COMBAT THE PROLIFERATION OF </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  DASD RICARDEL REQUESTED </p><p>CROATIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS NOTING THAT CROATIA EXPERIENCED FIRST-HAND THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF STATES\' NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UN RESOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>CHOD LUCIC:  U.S. COOPERATION ALREADY BEARS RESULTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>17.
