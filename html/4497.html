<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR DO -- SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  FATF UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) With the threat of FATF-directed "counter-measures" </p><p>looming three weeks away, Nigeria\'s House of Representatives </p><p>on November 21 passed all three pending pieces of money </p><p>laundering legislation. These are amendments to the 1995 </p><p>Money Laundering Act and 1991 Banking and Other Financial </p><p>Institutions Act and the Financial Crimes Commission Act. </p><p>The Senate has yet to vote on any of the legislation, though </p><p>there are indications a vote could come within the next few </p><p>days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU)  RNLEO, accompanied by LEGATT, Assisant USSS Attache </p><p>and Assistant DEA Attache, November 25 called on Alhaji </p><p>Abudllahi Abubakar, Chairman of the Senate Committee on </p><p>Narcotics and Financial Crimes -- one of three Senate </p><p>Committees reviewing the money laundering legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Abubakar expressed appreciation for the seriousness </p><p>of the impending sanctions, while complaining that the </p><p>Presidency had only proposed the two Amendments in late </p><p>September and was now pushing the National Assembly to act </p><p>quickly or face the blame for international condemnation on </p><p>money laundering.   Noting that the House had passed all </p><p>three bills without revisions, Abubakar stated that he and </p><p>other other Chairmen in the Senate had first wanted to merge </p><p>all three pieces of legislation into one bill since they all </p><p>cover the same topic.  In the interest of time, however, the </p><p>Senators agreed to vote on all three separately.  Abubakar </p><p>revealed that the Senate has made two changes to the Banking </p><p>and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Amendment.  The draft </p><p>BOFI amendment presented by the Presidency allows the CBN to </p><p>refuse a bank or financial institution a license without </p><p>stating a reason.  The Senate feels this is not reasonable </p><p>and has changed the bill\'s language to require an explicit </p><p>reason.  Also, the President\'s BOFI amendment allows the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze accounts if deemed </p><p>suspicious.  Abubakar said the Senate believes this is giving </p><p>the Executive too much power and has changed the bill\'s </p><p>language to require a court order before an account can be </p><p>frozen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The other two bills -- the Money Laundering Act </p><p>amendment and the Financial Crimes Commission Act -- </p><p>apparently have not been modified by the Senate.  Abubakar </p><p>assured the USG visitors that all three would be brought to a </p><p>vote by November 27, though he acknowledged that the House </p><p>and Senate versions of at least one bill will be discordant </p><p>and will require "harmonization" between the two houses (i.e. </p><p>convocation of a conference committee).  Abubukar was upbeat </p><p>on the prospects of having the bills passed by the Senate and </p><p>reconciled with the House before the National Assembly </p><p>adjourns for holidays in early December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) Post will continue to monitor this situation closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
