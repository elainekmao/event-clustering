<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003397 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UNION OF CHAMBERS PRESIDENT BRIEFS AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>INITIATIVES TO BOLSTER U.S.-TURKEY TIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Influential Union of Chambers of Commerce (TOBB) </p><p>President Rifat Hisarciklioglu told the Ambassador May 22 </p><p>that he had returned from a three-day visit to Washington </p><p>with agreement on several specific initiatives to bolster the </p><p>bilateral relationship.  They include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- establishing a working group to promote bilateral trade; </p><p>- sponsoring a June 2003 meeting on attracting more foreign </p><p>direct investment from the United States; </p><p>- setting up, in cooperation with the Brookings Institution, </p><p>a think-tank in Turkey to study the trans-Aatlantic relations </p><p>and Turkey\'s EU accession; and </p><p>- putting together a contact group with CSIS to talk about </p><p>how to redefine the strategic relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)   Hisarciklioglu said he had also stressed in </p><p>Washington that Turkey could and should play a helpful role </p><p>in building a stable and prosperous Iraq and in advancing the </p><p>Middle East Peace Process. He reported that, following FM </p><p>Gul\'s visit to Israel and the Israeli President\'s expected </p><p>visit to Turkey, Prime Minister Erdogan would visit Israel, </p><p>probably in August-September.  (Note:  We have not heard </p><p>officially about an Erdogan visit, but will follow up with </p><p>the Foreign Ministry.  End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Ambassador expressed appreciation for TOBB\'s </p><p>specific ideas, stressing that Turkey needed to take concrete </p><p>steps -- not just offer rhetoric -- to rebuild bilateral </p><p>relations.  He offered to work with TOBB on the various </p><p>initiatives, and stressed that he hoped to see specific ideas </p><p>on enhancing trade and U.S. investment in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On Iraq, Ambassador noted that the large flows of </p><p>humanitarian goods already underway indicated that the </p><p>Turkey-Iraq trade route was a natural.  He suggested that a </p><p>scenario in which the U.S. and Turkey saw eye-to-eye on the </p><p>development of a new Iraq would prove enormously beneficial </p><p>to both the Turkish and the Iraqi economies.  On the other </p><p>hand, should there be disagreements, the resulting political </p><p>tension would have a negative impact on both economies. </p><p>Recalling several recent unhelpful statements by members of </p><p>Turkey\'s establishment, he volunteered that -- at this point </p><p>-- Americans do not really know where Turkey stands on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  A steady stream of Turks have been knocking </p><p>on the Ambassador\'s door asking (a) how bad the damage to the </p><p>relationship is, and (b) what Turkey needs to do to repair </p><p>that damage.  Ambassador\'s consistent message has been that, </p><p>while the U.S. still considers Turkey to be a friend, </p><p>Turkey\'s failure to support us on an issue of overwhelming </p><p>national interest cannot be ignored.  For the relationship to </p><p>regain its strength, Turkey (the whole country, not just the </p><p>government) needs to stop sniping at us and take positive, </p><p>specific steps on Iraq, Cyprus, and the Middle East Peace </p><p>Process. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
