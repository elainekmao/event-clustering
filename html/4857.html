BOMB ATTACK ON TAA IN ADANA </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milliyet)  Last night (12/23), two </p><p>assailants on a motorcycle threw what the paper called </p><p>a `sound\' bomb on the Turkish American Association </p><p>(TAA) building and then disappeared.  The bomb </p><p>exploded, making a loud noise and shattering windows </p><p>at the TAA office and nearby buildings.  No casualties </p><p>were reported.  Police arrived at the scene following </p><p>the explosion and took comprehensive security </p><p>measures.  An operation was launched to capture the </p><p>assailants.  Oya Ilkim of TAA said the association had </p><p>nothing to do with the U.S., other than its name and </p><p>that only language courses were offered there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Demonstrations were held in Izmir, Mersin, </p><p>Batman, Siirt and Diyarbakir to protest isolation of </p><p>KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.  Protestors burned </p><p>roads by pouring gasoline, shouting pro-Ocalan </p><p>slogans, dancing to tunes of Turkish folk music, </p><p>marching with torches in their hands, and turning on </p><p>and off their lights for ten minutes.  Following </p><p>demonstrations in Diyarbakir, police arrested 20 </p><p>youths wearing kerchiefs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  GOVERNMENT WILL PAY INDEMNITY </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Van Court of General Criminal </p><p>Jurisdiction ruled against the State in connection </p><p>with the 45-day detention of 70 hunger strikers who </p><p>were among 500 people arrested in the People\'s </p><p>Democracy Party (HADEP) office.  Forty-five arrestees </p><p>were later ordered held in custody on charges of </p><p>"assisting and abetting the PKK."  Acquitted after 70 </p><p>days in prison, the hunger strikers sued the State by </p><p>claiming "they had been detained for no reason."  They </p><p>will receive TL 1.5 billion (approx. USD 900) each in </p><p>material and moral reparations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  DROP IN ENERGY PRODUCTION </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  Energy production at Sanliurfa\'s </p><p>Ataturk Dam Hydro-electric Power Plant, which produces </p><p>1/5 of Turkey\'s electricity needs, fell from 8 billion </p><p>kilowatt/hours in 2001 to 6 billion kilowatt/hours in </p><p>2002.  The drop was attributed to drought in Turkey </p><p>over the past two years.  The level of water in the </p><p>reservoir behind the dam has reportedly fallen to 528 </p><p>(cm), with only four of the eight turbines working. </p><p>Electricity production fell from 7 billion </p><p>kilowatt/hours to 5 billion kilowatt/hours in the </p><p>Karakaya (Diyarbakir) Dam and from 6 to 4,865 billion </p><p>kilowatt/hours in the Keban (Elazig) Dam.  Only three </p><p>of Karakaya\'s six turbines and two of Keban\'s seven </p><p>turbines are currently operational. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO EAST EUROPE UP OVER 38% </p><p>(Evrensel)  According to the Southeastern Anatolia </p><p>Exporters\' Union, agricultural exports from the </p><p>Southeast to East Europe increased 38.2% in the first </p><p>eleven months of the year, rising to USD 58.7 million </p><p>from USD 42.5 million for the same period in 2001.  In </p><p>the same period, USD 53.7 million of textile, USD 4.1 </p><p>million of dried fruits and USD 983,000 of grain, </p><p>beans and seed products were exported from the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDESERVED COTTON SUBSIDIES </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  Through satellite photographing, </p><p>Agricultural and Village Affairs Ministry inspectors </p><p>determined 1,800 Kiziltepe (Mardin) farmers had </p><p>unjustly received a total of USD 600,000 in Cotton </p><p>Support Premium payments.  Farmers who had made </p><p>fraudulent declarations were ordered to repay the </p><p>undeserved premium payments. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
