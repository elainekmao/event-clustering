(U)  THE SYRIAN MEDIA ON 5 NOVEMBER ANNOUNCED </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEBANESE SHIA AMAL AND HIZBALLAH </p><p>MOVEMENTS FOLLOWING TALKS AT THE SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>WHICH REPORTEDLY BEGAN THE EVENING OF 4 NOVEMBER.  THE </p><p>ACCORD WAS SIGNED BY AMAL LEADER NABIH BERRI AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH SECRETARY GENERAL SUBHI AL-TUFAYLI "UNDER THE </p><p>AUSPICES" OF THE IRANIAN AND SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTERS AND </p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF IN </p><p>LEBANON, BRIGADIER GENERAL GHAZI KANAAN.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE TWO SIDES WILL HELP FACILITATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>THE LEBANESE ARMY IN SOUTHERN LEBANON "IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS ABILITY TO ENFORCE LAW AND ORDER." </p><p> </p><p>--  ANY DISAGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AGREEMENT </p><p>MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH REFERENCE TO THE SYRIAN AND </p><p>IRANIAN PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO THEIR INTERPRETATION. </p><p> </p><p>--  ALL PERSONS EVACUATED AS A RESULT OF AMAL- </p><p>HIZBALLAH FIGHTING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>"AREAS, VILLAGES, AND HOMES." </p><p> </p><p>--  A COMMITTEE WILL BE FORMED, "COMPRISING BRIGADIER. </p><p>GENERAL.

(U)  BEYOND MENTIONING HABIBI\'S DESCRIPTION OF </p><p>HIS TALKS AS "SUCCESSFUL AND FRUITFUL" ON HIS RETURN </p><p>TO TEHRAN NOVEMBER 6, THE SYRIAN MEDIA HAS NOT </p><p>PROVIDED DETAILS OF ANY SUBSTANTIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS </p><p>TOWARD THE STATED GOAL OF "CHARTING A PLAN OF ACTION" </p><p>TO DEVELOP BILATERAL RELATIONS "IN ALL FIELDS."  BOTH </p><p>SIDES AGREED TO FORM SUBCOMMITTEES TO FOLLOW UP THE </p><p>SYRIAN-IRANIAN JOINT COMMITTEE\'S THREE SESSIONS ON </p><p>BILATERAL COOPERATION.  HABIBI MET WITH SYRIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD (IN LATAKIA) ON NOVEMBER 4, AS WELL AS </p><p>WITH VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM.  OTHER MEETINGS BETWEEN </p><p>IRANIAN AND SYRIAN OFFICIALS DEALT WITH LEBANON AND </p><p>OTHER "REGIONAL AND BILATERAL ISSUES," ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE LIMITED MEDIA REPORTING. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>EXCHANGE OF POSITIONS ON THE GULF CRISIS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHILE SYRIA CONSIDERS ITS SUCCESS ENSURING </p><p>IRANIAN COMPLIANCE WITH UN SANCTIONS ON IRAQ TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN THE SUPREME ACCOMPLISHMENT OF ASAD\'S SEPTEMBER </p><p>VISIT TO IRAN, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES </p><p>ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES APPARENTLY </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE.  ALTHOUGH SYRIAN MEDIA HAVE </p><p>BEEN LARGELY SILENT ON GULF-BELATED ISSUES (SEE </p><p>SEPTEL ON INFORMATION MINISTER SALMAN\'S RECENT </p><p>REAFFIRMATION THAT SYRIA DEMANDS IRAQ\'S FULL AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT), WE NOTE THAT </p><p>IRANIAN MEDIA CITED HABIBI\'S NOVEMBER 4 STATEMENT </p><p>THAT "ALLIED FORCES MUST WITHDRAW FROM THE REGION" </p><p>AND THAT KHADDAM SAID IN RESPONSE THAT "THE PERMANENT </p><p>PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES HAS NOT TOLERABLE."  THE </p><p>TWO SIDES ALSO RECONFIRMED THEIR REJECTION OF ANY </p><p>GEOGRAPHICAL CHANGES IN THE REGION AND THEIR SUPPORT </p><p>FOR COLLECTIVE REGIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION.  SYRIAN </p><p>PRESS ON NOVEMBER 7 QUOTED HABIBI\'S ARRIVAL STATEMENT </p><p>AFFIRMING SYRIA\'S AND IRAN\'S CONDEMNATION OF IRAQ\'S </p><p>INVASION OF KUWAIT AND THE TWO GOVERNMENTS\' CALL FOR </p><p>IRAQ\'S UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THIS LATEST AGREEMENT TO END THE OFTEN </p><p>BLOODY INTRA-SHIA FEUDING IN LEBANON WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS VISIT.  UPON HIS </p><p>RETURN TO TEHRAN, HABIBI LAUDED THE AGREEMENT AS AN </p><p>ACHIEVEMENT WHICH WILL ENABLE "THE MOBILIZATION OF </p><p>ALL CAPABILITIES TO CONFRONT THE ZIONIST ENEMY." </p><p>HIZBALLAH LEADER AL-TUFAYLI ECHOED THIS SENTIMENT </p><p>WHILE AMAL LEADER BERRI, BY CONTRAST, MERELY VOICED </p><p>THE HOPE THAT AMAL AND HIZBALLAH MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE </p><p>TO "RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND VILLAGES." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>OTHER ASPECTS OF THE VISIT MAY REFLECT DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>OVER THORNY BILATERAL MATTERS LIKE ECONOMIC </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  OUR COLLEAGUES TELL US THAT ASAD DID NOT </p><p>OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE TO CONTINUED OR INCREASED </p><p>ECONOMIC AID TO SYRIA BY CERTAIN HARDLINE IRANIAN </p><p>CLERICS, BECAUSE OF SYRIA\'S 5.5 BILLION USD DEBT, </p><p>DURING ASAD\'S VISIT TO TEHRAN.  AS A RESULT, NO </p><p>CONCRETE TRADE AGREEMENTS WERE SIGNED, ALTHOUGH SYRIA </p><p>IS STILL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONTINUED IRANIAN </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO SELL IT OIL AT BELOW-MARKET RATES. </p><p>WHETHER THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE, IT DOES NOT APPEAR </p><p>FROM THE COMPOSITION OF THE IRANIAN DELEGATION OR THE </p><p>MODEST SYRIAN MEDIA COVERAGE THAT THIS FIRST </p><p>GATHERING OF THE SYRIAN-IRANIAN SUPREME COUNCIL WILL </p><p>RESULT IN HIGHER IRANIAN AID LEVELS FOR SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DJEREJIAN </p><p></p></div>
