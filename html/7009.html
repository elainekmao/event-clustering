SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, CASUALTIES AMONG IRAQI CIVILIANS, </p><p>SUICIDE BOMBERS HEADED TO BAGHDAD, AND SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>WARNINGS TO SYRIA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  EDITORIALS IN </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" AND "AL BAYAN" CLAIM THAT POWELL\'S THREAT TO SYRIA </p><p>SERVES ISRAEL\'S INTERESTS AND WHAT WAS SAID IN WHISPERS IS NOW </p><p>CLEARLY ANNOUNCED.  IN AN "AL KHALEEJ" OP-ED, DR. ABDULKHALEQ </p><p>ABDULLA CRITICIZED WHAT HE CALLED "A CONFUSED GCC POSITION" </p><p>TOWARDS THE WAR.  IN "AL ITTIHAD" ARTICLE, ABDULLA RASHEED </p><p>CRITICIZED THE SHALLOW REPORTING ON NUMEROUS ARAB SATELLITE </p><p>CHANNELS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ALLEGING SECRETARY POWELL\'S WARNING TO SYRIA IS FOR ISRAEL\'S </p><p>BENEFIT, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>4/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... ALONG WITH THE UK, WASHINGTON IS WAGING AN INVASION AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ, WARMING UP WITH ISRAEL AGAINST SYRIA, AND IN THE </p><p>BACKGROUND, THERE ARE LOOMING HOSTILE INTENTIONS TO TARGET </p><p>LEBANON IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING WAR OF LIQUIDATION AGAINST THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  THE WHOLE ARAB REGION WILL BE RESHAPED THROUGH </p><p>KILLING AND DESTRUCTION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SYRIA," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... POWELL MADE HIS RECENT REMARKS BEFORE THE ZIONIST AIPAC... </p><p>THIS IS HIS REAL IDENTITY, WHICH REFUTES CLAIMS ABOUT WASHINGTON </p><p>HAVING BOTH HAWKS AND DOVES.  ALL OF THEM ARE ALIKE:  LOYAL TO </p><p>ISRAEL AND HOSTILE TO THE ARABS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CLAIMING THE WAR HAS DISPOSED OF ALL PRETENSES, UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON 4/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... YES, BUSH IRRITATES US WITH HIS STATEMENTS, HE STABS US DEEP </p><p>IN OUR HEARTS, OUR DEEPEST WOUNDS, AND OUR SORROW WHEN HE STANDS </p><p>AND BOASTS OF VICTORY FOR HIS TROOPS, STATING THAT THEY ARE DOING </p><p>THEIR JOBS AND TASKS PROPERLY!  CLAPPING AND APPLAUSE OCCUR ALL </p><p>AROUND HIM, WHILE BLOOD IS SHED AND MARTYRS FALL.  YES, MR. </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT:  OUR MURDER IS GOING JUST AS YOU PLANNED!" </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "A CONFUSED GCC POSITION," UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>DR. ABDULKHALEQ ABDULLA WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... THIS WAR HAS PUT THE GCC COUNTRIES IN A VERY AWKWARD </p><p>POSITION, WHICH WILL GET WORSE IF THIS WAR GOES ON FOR A LONG </p><p>TIME ... WHAT ARE THEIR POST-WAR PLANS?  WHAT IS THEIR POSITION </p><p>TOWARDS IRAQ: A NEW IRAQ OR THE OLD IRAQ?  THE IRAQ OF SADDAM (IF </p><p>HE IS STILL THERE) OR IRAQ AFTER SADDAM?  HOW ARE THEY GOING TO </p><p>REACT TOWARDS THE AMERICAN MILITARY VICTORY OR FAILURE?  MORE </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, HOW WOULD THEY DEAL WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN AN </p><p>ARAB WORLD MOBILIZED AGAINST THE WAR AND EACH PARTY PARTICIPATING </p><p>IN THE ONGOING MASSACRE?  IF THE CURRENT SITUATION IS CONFUSING </p><p>FOR THE GCC COUNTRIES, THEN THE POST-WAR ERA WILL BE MORE </p><p>CONFUSING, AND IT IS ABOUT TIME TO START THINKING ABOUT THE </p><p>FUTURE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  CRITICIZING AMERICAN WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/31: </p><p> </p><p>"... POLITICAL AND MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCING LIES </p><p>DAILY REGARDING ATTACKS ON IRAQ ... COULD THE BRITISH-AMERICAN </p><p>WEAPONS OF KILLING AND DESTRUCTION BE BOTH INTELLIGENT AND </p><p>STUPID?  INTELLIGENT, SINCE THEY DO NOT ATTACK IRAQI CIVILIANS, </p><p>WHOM THEY CLAIM THEY ARE GOING TO \'LIBERATE.\'  STUPID, SINCE THEY </p><p>ATTACKED THEIR OWN SOLDIERS MORE THAN ONCE, AND THEIR MISSILES </p><p>FELL (BY MISTAKE) IN IRAN, TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "STOP THE WAR," "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>3/31: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT IS SAD THAT DESPITE THE TREMOR AGAINST THE WAR ALL OVER </p><p>THE WORLD, WEAPONS OF WAR ARE STILL CAUSING DESTRUCTION </p><p>EVERYWHERE ... WHAT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING IS THAT AMERICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE ACTUAL WAR HAS NOT STARTED YET, REFERRING </p><p>TO A PLAN FOR ATTACKING BAGHDAD.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE LAND OF </p><p>MESOPOTAMIA WHEN THIS \'ACTUAL\' WAR STARTS?  IT WILL MEAN MORE </p><p>DESTRUCTION, KILLING, AND THE FURTHER DISPLACEMENT OF THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  CRITICIZING ARAB SATELLITE TV CHANNELS, UAE COLUMNIST ABDULLA </p><p>RASHEED WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON </p><p>3/31: </p><p> </p><p>"... WE RECEIVE AROUND 60 ARAB SATELLITE CHANNELS, HALF ARE </p><p>REPORTING THE WAR IN IRAQ FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS DAY AND NIGHT, BUT </p><p>I AM SURE THAT WE CANNOT FIND TWO CHANNELS THAT AGREE ON ONE </p><p>POINT OR ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION." </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENTING ON DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD, CHIEF EDITOR OF </p><p>"AL-KHALEEJ" DR. ABDULLA TERYAM WROTE IN AN EDITORIAL 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ARAB POPULATION SEEMS TO BE ISOLATED AND STRANGE IN ITS </p><p>OWN LAND SINCE IT IS DEPRIVED OF THE SLIGHTEST HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>INCLUDING PARTICIPATION AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  IT WILL NOT </p><p>GET OUT OF THIS ISOLATION EXCEPT THROUGH ONE DOOR:  FREEDOM, </p><p>WHICH HAS ONLY ONE MEANING, AND THAT IS DEMOCRACY, PARTICIPATION, </p><p>FREE ELECTIONS, AND HEALTHY REPRESENTATIVE COUNCILS.  ISLAM IS IN </p><p>ITS WORST HISTORICAL CRISIS, WHICH MEANS ARABISM IS IN A BIGGER </p><p>CRISIS, SINCE AS LONG AS ISLAM IS WELL, ARABISM IS WELL..." </p><p> </p><p>10.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "WHAT ARE THE ARABS WAITING FOR?," </p><p>PROMINENT EMIRATI BUSINESSMAN KHALAF AHMED AL HABTOOR WROTE IN </p><p>THE EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" ON 4/1: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHEN PALESTINE AND BAGHDAD ARE ENCIRCLED, IT MEANS THAT THE </p><p>WHOLE ARAB HOMELAND IS UNDER SIEGE!  WHO OF US CAN CLAIM THAT HE </p><p>DOES NOT LIVE IN THE HUGE JAIL MADE FOR US BY THE WEST, </p><p>STRANGLING US WITH THEIR BARBED WIRE, LIMITING OUR MOVEMENT, </p><p>THINKING, FREEDOM, AND EVEN DREAMING SPACE.  WHAT WE NEED TO DO </p><p>NOW, TO AVOID BEING STRANGLED, IS TO JOIN OUR RANKS ON THE </p><p>OFFICIAL AND POPULAR LEVEL TO FIGHT AND RESIST THE COMING SIEGE." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
