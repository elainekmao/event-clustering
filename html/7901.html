<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, SOCI, ASEC, CASC, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: SPURNED EX-PACS KIDNAP OFFICIALS, BURN PROPERTIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Former civil patrol members (ex-PACs) on </p><p>Guatemala\'s south coast rioted on May 5 to protest continued </p><p>delays in promised GOG payments for their war-time service. </p><p>In San Francisco Zapotitlan, a small municipality in </p><p>Suchitepequez Province, former members of civil-defense </p><p>committees took the mayor and provincial governor hostage </p><p>after many civil patrol members found their names were not </p><p>included on a list of PAC members authorized compensation. </p><p>The officials were released upon the arrival of special </p><p>police to restore order.  In nearby Chicacao, hundreds of </p><p>angry PACs burned the mayor\'s office, house, and cars, </p><p>starting fires that also consumed a market and a museum. </p><p>Tensions remain high as the complex and poorly understood </p><p>compensation process gets underway after numerous delays. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On Sunday, May 4, former PAC members began gathering in </p><p>Mazatenango, capital of Suchitepequez Province, where they </p><p>expected to receive the first of three GOG payments for their </p><p>service during Guatemala\'s internal conflict.  On Monday </p><p>morning, May 5, their numbers had reached 15,000 by some </p><p>accounts.  The process for determining who qualified for </p><p>payment and how the payments would be made was not clear to </p><p>the former civil patrol members, and thousands of those who </p><p>arrived seeking payment were not on the list.  New delays in </p><p>transferring the funds caused local authorities to call on </p><p>the PACs to return to their respective communities.  Many did </p><p>so without incident, but tensions boiled over in San </p><p>Francisco Zapotitlan and Chicacao, about 170 kilometers south </p><p>west of Guatemala City. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In San Francisco Zapotitlan, frustrated ex-PACs took </p><p>advantage of the presence of Provincial Governor, Fernando </p><p>Terecero Muxi, to press their demands by holding him hostage </p><p>along with the Mayor, Marco Tulio Gonzalez.  Both officials </p><p>were released unharmed several hours later when members of </p><p>Police Special Forces arrived. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In Chicacao, several thousand people from surrounding </p><p>communities descended on the Mayor\'s office to demand </p><p>payment.  Of the 2,600 people who had registered as PACs in </p><p>this office, only 240 had reportedly been approved for </p><p>payment.  (Comment: nationwide, some 620,000 people </p><p>registered as ex-PACs in response to President Portillo\'s </p><p>promise to pay them for service during the conflict. </p><p>However, the GOG has approved payments to only about 160,000 </p><p>people whose names appear on lists maintained by the Defense </p><p>Ministry, plus another 18,000 war widows. End Comment.) </p><p>According to press accounts, the crowd became unruly and </p><p>began looting when it learned the majority present would </p><p>receive no payment.  Some charged that the 240 who were </p><p>approved for payment were supporters of the mayor.  The </p><p>Mayor\'s son apparently began firing into the air in order to </p><p>extract his father from the building.  The crowd responded by </p><p>setting fire to the office and then to the Mayor\'s home and </p><p>both his official and personal vehicles.  The fires spread to </p><p>the market, destroying some 35 small businesses and a museum </p><p>before heavy rains put them out.  One person died, apparently </p><p>of cardiac arrest, in the disturbances.  Police and military </p><p>units arrived by evening to restore order. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment:  The complicated process of compensating the </p><p>PACs has just begun, and we expect further misunderstandings </p><p>will occur.  While the situation in Suchitipequez appears to </p><p>be an isolated incident, the potential for disturbances in </p><p>other areas where the compensation is being paid exists.  In </p><p>the year since PACs shut down Peten Province and eventually </p><p>obtained Portillo\'s promise to pay, they have been unable to </p><p>organize nationally even as the compensation package was </p><p>reduced and the lists of eligible recipients vetted.  Most </p><p>PACs appear content to wait and see if they are among the </p><p>160,000 who will eventually be paid.  However, we have heard </p><p>numerous reports of corruption in the registry process, and </p><p>it remains possible that people who paid to have their names </p><p>included on the list may take measures against those they </p><p>paid if they are excluded.  In this election year, charges of </p><p>fraud or favoritism could lead to violence.  The GOG\'s </p><p>decision to provide compensation at the provincial level </p><p>guarantees that there will be a lack of uniformity in the </p><p>process.  Press accounts report that the registration process </p><p>to qualify for compensation is proceeding uneventfully so far </p><p>in Peten, Quiche and Zacapa.  There were no incidents in </p><p>Guatemala City among the more than 2,000 ex-PACs who </p><p>assembled in the Zone 1 on Monday.  We have yet to see </p><p>reports that actual cash payments have been made and will </p><p>continue to monitor this issue. </p><p> </p><p>6.  While we will keep a close eye on the overall security </p><p>situation, at this time there is no indication that the </p><p>ex/PACS in Suchitepequez might attempt to disrupt the CAFTA </p><p>and Consultative Group meetings in Guatemala (scheduled for </p><p>the week of May 12). </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
