<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA/CEN, PM, EB, OES, AND L </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, PGOV, MOPS, ECON, EFIS, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ONGOING MARITIME DISPUTE BETWEEN HONDURAS AND </p><p>NICARAGUA MAY BE ON THE PATH TO RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 652 </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 606 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Nicaraguan and Honduran military authorities recently </p><p>deemed ongoing territorial disputes between the two nations </p><p>in the process of resolution, according to press reports. </p><p>Nicaraguan GEN Javier Carrion articulated his commitment to </p><p>resolving maritime disputes peacefully, as well as to </p><p>fostering a constructive means of communicating disagreements </p><p>between both countries.  In response, head of the Honduran </p><p>armed forces, GEN Jose Barahona, affirmed that relations have </p><p>improved in the region, due in part to the recent commitment </p><p>of Central American countries to resolving maritime and land </p><p>disputes through instruments of international mediation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The maritime disagreement between both countries </p><p>stems from controversy over competing claims to maritime </p><p>territory and their exclusive economic zones in the </p><p>countries\' Pacific and Caribbean coasts.  One flash point is </p><p>fishing rights.  Nicaragua has alleged that Hondurans have </p><p>been illegally fishing in the Gulf of Fonseca, whose waters </p><p>are shared by Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. </p><p>Diplomatic tensions came to a head in November 1999 when </p><p>Honduras signed an agreement with Colombia in the Caribbean </p><p>which Nicaraguan authorities claimed led to the usurping of </p><p>130,000 square km of Nicaraguan maritime territory.  In </p><p>response, Nicaragua imposed a 35 percent tariff on </p><p>Honduran-made products and sued Honduras in the International </p><p>Court of Justice.  Nicaragua finally revoked its retaliatory </p><p>tariff on Honduran products in March of this year. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) General Carrion recently announced that Nicaragua </p><p>would await the International Court of Justice\'s decision on </p><p>the Caribbean maritime border dispute, expected in 2004. </p><p>Likewise, General Barahona articulated his support for the </p><p>process and his hope that international mediation would </p><p>foster closer relations between the Central American </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  The good news here is that there is an </p><p>obvious channel of communication between the two military </p><p>chiefs.  However, many members of the Honduran armed forces </p><p>remain deeply suspicious of Nicaraguan intentions.  In </p><p>addition, GEN Carrion\'s public commentary also highlights the </p><p>need for a clearer delineation of maritime borders in the </p><p>Gulf of Fonseca through the use of buoys.  Despite his </p><p>positive stance, GEN Carrion warned that Honduran and El </p><p>Salvadoran fishermen who crossed illegally into Nicaraguan </p><p>waters would be detained.  Honduran officials tell EmbOffs </p><p>that this is exactly the kind of Nicaraguan enforcement </p><p>action in the gulf that normally exacerbates tensions.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
