(u)  Summary:  We have met over the past weeks with a </p><p>number of GOJ officials regarding the complaint Electronic </p><p>Arts (EA) raised through the International Intellectual </p><p>Property Alliance (IIPA) regarding importation of pirated </p><p>software from Syria.  The cause of the complaint appears to </p><p>have been a communications breakdown within Jordan\'s piracy </p><p>interdiction system, rather than a willful attempt to </p><p>circumvent the existing IPR protection regime.  Nevertheless, </p><p>our interviews have highlighted gaps in the current system </p><p>that we hope to begin addressing through increased training </p><p>and retooling of the procedural and legislative framework for </p><p>IPR protection in Jordan.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>EA\'S COMPLAINT </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  On December 11, 2002, the International Intellectual </p><p>Property Alliance (IIPA) brought to the attention of USPTO </p><p>and the Embassy a claim by Electronic Arts (EA), an </p><p>entertainment software developer, that Jordanian customs </p><p>authorities had been releasing unauthorized copies of EA </p><p>software imported from Syria into the local market without </p><p>first seeking the opinion of the National Library (the entity </p><p>responsible for copyright enforcement in Jordan).  EA </p><p>asserted that Jordanian customs had instead relied on </p><p>approvals from the Ministry of Information\'s "Censorship </p><p>Office", which has no copyright enforcement authority, as the </p><p>basis for releasing the pirated goods. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Later that same day, USPTO raised EA\'s complaint </p><p>with the Jordanian delegation to the Joint Economic Committee </p><p>meeting in Washington, at which time Jordanian Trade Minister </p><p>Salah Bashir assured the USDEL that such a practice was not </p><p>in conformity with Jordanian law.  He pledged to review the </p><p>complaint upon his return to Amman. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOW UP ACTION </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Following up, emboffs spoke with EA\'s local </p><p>distributor, Shihab Khalil, to flesh out the details of his </p><p>complaint.  We then met throughout January with officials in </p><p>the Trade Ministry, Customs Directorate, the Amman Customs </p><p>House, the Jaber border crossing with Syria, the National </p><p>Library, and the Censorship Office.  We relayed in each case </p><p>the USG\'s concerns over the possibility that GOJ offices had </p><p>sanctioned the importation of unauthorized EA software.  GOJ </p><p>officials reiterated that such activity would not be in </p><p>conformity with Jordanian law.  The final decision maker in </p><p>this case, the Amman customs house, admitted that such </p><p>activity had taken place in the past, but assured us that the </p><p>culprit was lack of communication among Customs, the National </p><p>Library, and the Censorship Office.  He assured us this would </p><p>not be a problem in the future. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Jordan has an overall good track record with regards </p><p>to interdiction of unauthorized A/V material and software. </p><p>During our trip to the Syrian border, we visited the </p><p>interdiction warehouse and saw the daily "take" of pirated CD </p><p>music and games - maybe two dozen copies confiscated from </p><p>individual travelers.  The biggest hurdle to better </p><p>interdiction in the first instance is that CD\'s are easily </p><p>concealed and transported - several hundred can be brought </p><p>over in a shoebox by a taxi driver.  The GOJ has asked for </p><p>additional periodic training for line officers at border </p><p>points on IPR issues, which we are examining.  Nevertheless, </p><p>interdiction will never be air-tight. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Jordan is an importer of pirated goods but not a </p><p>producer.  We are looking at an institutional level for ways </p><p>to improve IPR enforcement in the kingdom.  In the case of </p><p>the EA issue, that means looking at new mechanisms for closer </p><p>communication among Customs, the National Library, and the </p><p>Censorship Office.  It also means looking at current IPR </p><p>legislation to find ways to beef up the National Library\'s </p><p>ability to initiate enforcement action.  This could mean, for </p><p>instance, expanding the scope of its legal authority - </p><p>currently, the Library only has authority to confiscate goods </p><p>found in shops.  It has no authority at border points or even </p><p>on the street.  We will work with the Library and other </p><p>entities in coming months to improve these and other aspects </p><p>of Jordan\'s IPR environment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
