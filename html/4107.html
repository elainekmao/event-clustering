<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SA/FO ROCCA, CAMP </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PAB SA/RA (FOR SCENSNY) </p><p>SA/PD LJIRWIN, WREINCKENS, SHOVANEC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR KPAO SL </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBO-COMMISSIONED POLL GIVES HIGH MARKS TO USG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In FY2002 Embassy Colombo commissioned an opinion poll </p><p>to assess Sri Lankan public perceptions of USG policies </p><p>regarding the peace process.  The poll was performed by a </p><p>local affiliate of A. G. Nielsen.  Its findings were </p><p>presented to a country team meeting convened on 10/24. </p><p> </p><p>2. The poll focused on: </p><p> </p><p>- general perceptions of the U.S. and other nations </p><p>involved in the peace process </p><p> </p><p>- levels of American involvement in the process </p><p> </p><p>- the current U.S. role in the process </p><p> </p><p>- expectations for the future </p><p> </p><p>3. Findings. </p><p> </p><p>3.1. General perceptions: </p><p> </p><p>- Within both "conflict" (i.e., the North and East) and </p><p>"non-conflict" areas, India is perceived as Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>best friend in South Asia. </p><p> </p><p>- Beyond South Asia, the U.S. is perceived in "non- </p><p>conflict" areas as Sri Lanka\'s best friend, Norway by Sri </p><p>Lankans living in "conflict" areas. </p><p> </p><p>- The U.S. is seen as "moderately trustworthy" in both </p><p>"conflict" and "non-conflict" areas. </p><p> </p><p>- Norway and India excepted, the U.S. has been the most </p><p>influential international player in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>- The U.S. has no significant bias towards any Sri Lankan </p><p>ethnic group. </p><p> </p><p>3.2. Levels of U.S. involvement </p><p> </p><p>- For Sri Lankans in both "conflict" and "non-conflict" </p><p>areas, the U.S. "gives adequate attention" to Sri Lankan </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>- "Non-conflict" Sri Lankans perceive the U.S. to be </p><p>particularly involved in solving "the ethnic problem </p><p>through mediation" and "improv[ing] the economy." </p><p>"Conflict" Sri Lankans agree that the U.S. provides </p><p>economic assistance, although "providing military ... </p><p>assistance to fight the war" is more often cited. "Non- </p><p>conflict" Sri Lankans would prefer that the U.S. continue </p><p>its mediation efforts; for "conflict" Sri Lankans, </p><p>additional economic assistance is a higher priority. </p><p> </p><p>3.3. The USG and the current peace process </p><p> </p><p>- "Conflict" and "non-conflict" Sri Lankans alike believe </p><p>that the U.S. has influenced the LTTE to agree to the </p><p>cease-fire and has been "involved in the monitoring </p><p>process." </p><p> </p><p>- They also give the U.S. high marks for "sincerity" and </p><p>"honesty," although "conflict" Sri Lankans wonder about </p><p>our "ulterior motives" while in "non-conflict" areas our </p><p>national interests are occasionally questioned. </p><p> </p><p>3.4. Expected Involvement in the current peace process </p><p> </p><p>- 67 percent of "conflict" Sri Lankans and 48 percent of </p><p>"non-conflict" Sri Lankans expect the U.S. to play a </p><p>larger role in facilitating peace. </p><p> </p><p>- In "non-conflict" areas it is hoped that American </p><p>facilitation will bring both sides to the negotiating </p><p>table, and influence the LTTE to "forego" some of its </p><p>"hard demands."  "Conflict" area Sri Lankans hope that </p><p>the U.S. will "get more involved in the monitoring </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>- If the peace process succeeds, most Sri Lankans, </p><p>particularly in the North and East, hope that the U.S. </p><p>will provide economic assistance to the country. </p><p> </p><p>- Were the process to fail, "conflict" area Sri Lankans </p><p>would expect the USG to mediate further "between the </p><p>government and the LTTE to solve the problem through </p><p>peace."  "Non-conflict" area Sri Lankans would want the </p><p>USG to respond with "military intervention," "military </p><p>assistance," and funds to pursue a "full-fledged war </p><p>against the LTTE." </p><p> </p><p>4. The A. C. Nielsen presentation received by the country </p><p>team on 10/24 has been sent via email to SA/PD.  Full texts </p><p>of the report are available at Embassy Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
