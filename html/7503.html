Barzani </p><p>told an Italian daily that the KDP won a victory by keeping </p><p>Turkish troops out of Northern Iraq.  Barzani reiterated </p><p>Kurdish aspirations for a federal Iraq, and warned that the </p><p>long-term presence of coalition forces in the country could </p><p>be interpreted as an invasion.  The MFA denounced PUK leader </p><p>Talabani for threatening to bring Diyarbakir and other </p><p>Kurdish-majority Turkish cities to the agenda if Turkey </p><p>continues to pursue its aspirations for Kirkuk.  A Turkish </p><p>diplomat is quoted as tying such controversial statements by </p><p>Kurdish leaders to the absence of a democratic culture in </p><p>Iraq.  The diplomat noted that Ankara, in an attempt to </p><p>avoid provocation, is closely following developments, and he </p><p>warned the Kurds not to try Turkey\'s patience.  He added </p><p>that Talabani could pay a dear price if he continued </p><p>opportunist moves such as attempting to assign a governor in </p><p>Kirkuk.  Kurdish representatives in Turkey complained to the </p><p>press that the Turkomen are constantly misinforming Ankara </p><p>about developments in Northern Iraq.  Meanwhile, papers </p><p>report that the expected head of the interim Iraq </p><p>administration, Jay Garner, met with the Turkish envoy to </p><p>Kuwait to discuss the situation of the Turkomen and Turkey\'s </p><p>role in the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus/EU: Dailies carry on the front page the `family </p><p>photograph\' of new EU members including the Greek Cypriots </p><p>after accession documents were signed in Athens.  Papers </p><p>criticize Foreign Minister Gul for boycotting the ceremony, </p><p>which indicated an `acknowledgement of the biggest </p><p>diplomatic defeat for Turkey.\'  Greek Cypriot leader </p><p>Papadopoulos attacked Turkey, saying that `artificial walls </p><p>and borders drawn by violence have prevented the Turkish </p><p>Cypriots from attending the Athens meeting.\'  Greek Prime </p><p>Minister Simitis said Europe has been united for 13 years </p><p>since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and blamed Turkey for </p><p>the ongoing disagreement on Cyprus.  `The line dividing </p><p>Nicosia is separating Ankara from Brussels,\' Simitis said. </p><p>Some mainstream papers believe Turkish Cypriots could still </p><p>join the EU if they work out a compromise with Greek </p><p>Cypriots before April 2004, but see it as unlikely for the </p><p>Greeks and Greek Cypriots to give a green light to Turkey\'s </p><p>membership.  Most papers, including the Islamist "Yeni </p><p>Safak," regard Denktas as the main obstacle that has </p><p>deprived Turkish Cypriots of the opportunity to join the EU. </p><p>Papers cite the Greek Cypriot press as applauding Denktas </p><p>for rejecting the Annan plan for Cyprus, thus facilitating </p><p>the Greek Cypriots\' EU entry.  The MFA and Denktas </p><p>criticized the signing of the accession protocol between the </p><p>EU and the Greek Cypriots, charging that it was a violation </p><p>of international treaties.  Denktas also strongly criticized </p><p>the Turkish Cypriot opposition parties who have accepted an </p><p>invitation by Greek Prime Minister Simitis for talks in the </p><p>Greek Cypriot sector.  However, Prime Minister Erdogan and </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul are upset with Denktas for attempting </p><p>to `dictate\' to Ankara that Gul should not attend the EU\'s </p><p>Athens summit.  Erdogan believed that the UN peace plan for </p><p>Cyprus had a chance for success, but that Denktas blocked </p><p>the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:   Post war scenarios </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who is next?" </p><p>Soli Ozel noted in mass appeal Sabah (4/17): "Despite the </p><p>strong warnings, a US military operation against Syria is </p><p>unlikely.  The Bush administration is currently going </p><p>through the list of measures in an orderly fashion, and at </p><p>the same time calling on the Damascus regime to `read </p><p>correctly\' the consequences of the Iraq war.  Washington </p><p>clearly is asking the Syrian administration to end support </p><p>for terrorism and to work for a lasting settlement with </p><p>Israel.  The policies pursued by Syria will shape future </p><p>developments in the region.  .. Another important factor to </p><p>watch carefully is US policy about the Israel-Palestine </p><p>issue in the Bush administration\'s new Middle East plan. . </p><p>Considering the approaches to the Middle East `road map\' </p><p>from both the US and Israel, we can draw a pessimistic </p><p>conclusion.  The way Washington sees the road map tells us </p><p>that the Israeli administration will not face any pressure </p><p>for peace, at least in the near future.  In other words, </p><p>peace and stability in the region are still far in the </p><p>distance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Transformation" </p><p>Hasan Cemal observed in mass appeal Milliyet (4/17): "The </p><p>situation in the Middle East up to now has not done Turkey </p><p>any good at all.  Thus we have to think rationally and </p><p>realize the following facts.  It is for the Turkey\'s good </p><p>and serves Turkey\'s interests that Iraq becomes a free </p><p>country with an emerging democracy.  It is absolutely the </p><p>best for Turkey when and if Syria is freed from the Baath </p><p>dictatorship and its support for terrorist organizations is </p><p>ended. . A peace between Palestine and Israel can also be </p><p>made possible if the US exerts enough pressure on Sharon, </p><p>especially after the normalization process of Iraq and </p><p>Syria.  Such a development might have positive effects for </p><p>change in Lebanon as well as in Iran. . The current </p><p>situation in the Middle East is in the process of a </p><p>transformation.  It means a certain amount of instability. </p><p>Yet the current situation was also inherently unstable. </p><p>Therefore, Turkey should refrain from siding with the status </p><p>quo and instead encourage the change which in fact will </p><p>serve Turkey\'s own interests." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
