<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL MAYORALTY: UP FOR GRABS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Istanbul Mayoralty, often characterized </p><p>as the second most desirable political prize in the country, </p><p>has become the focus of a back-room power struggle as players </p><p>jockey for ground in advance of the April 2004 local </p><p>elections. Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna, an independent since the </p><p>Virtue Party was banned in 2001, narrowly escaped a recent </p><p>Justice and Development (AK) Party-orchestrated no-confidence </p><p>vote in the normally acquiescent City Council.  Following his </p><p>now-public fallout with AK, there is widespread speculation </p><p>that he may join media tycoon Cem Uzan\'s Youth Party (GP), </p><p>thereby setting the stage for a tightly contested election </p><p>next year.  Other high-profile names are also being floated </p><p>as trial balloons, but most key political groups are waiting </p><p>cautiously before deciding which horse to bet on.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) For perhaps the first time ever, on March 28 the </p><p>Istanbul City Council refused to approve the Mayor\'s annual </p><p>report on the previous year\'s municipal activities.  118 of </p><p>the 203 City Council members, including the Justice and </p><p>Development (AK), Republican People\'s (CHP), and Felicity </p><p>(SP) Party groups, voted to reject the report; 42 Motherland </p><p>Party (ANAP) members voted in favor of approving the report. </p><p>A two-thirds majority (i.e., another 35 nay votes) would have </p><p>had the legal effect of a no-confidence vote.  The Governor </p><p>would have been forced to appoint a temporary replacement and </p><p>a formal dismissal case would have been opened against Mayor </p><p>Ali Mufit Gurtuna.  This development is particularly </p><p>surprising in light of the fact that the City Council is a </p><p>largely powerless, rubber-stamp body.  While its formal </p><p>duties do include approving the overall city budget, its </p><p>activities have been generally limited to approval of the </p><p>annual activity report and other ceremonial functions.  The </p><p>City Council includes municipal officials from Istanbul\'s </p><p>various districts, as well as part-time politicians who seek </p><p>the office primarily for influence to help advance their </p><p>private business careers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) So what did Mayor Gurtuna do to antagonize the City </p><p>Council?  Veteran AK Group President Huseyin Evliyaoglu </p><p>complained to poloff that the 2002 Municipal Report had not </p><p>been "serious":  first, it failed to focus on last year\'s </p><p>activities, simply recycling language and photographs from </p><p>previous editions; second, it arbitrarily put forth 550 new </p><p>spending projects (that deal less with the city\'s needs and </p><p>more with the fact that their total number corresponds to the </p><p>550th anniversary of the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul).  In </p><p>short, it was a mere "public relations document."  Evliyaoglu </p><p>did not deny, however, that the report was typical of </p><p>previous reports.  Pressed for more substantive criticisms, </p><p>Evliyaoglu openly suggested (while refraining from offering </p><p>details) that the real opposition to Gurtuna stemmed from </p><p>concerns about corruption and malfeasance.  Evliyaoglu also </p><p>complained that the major media groups have all been "bought </p><p>off" by the Mayor, claiming that in one incident Gurtuna </p><p>capitulated to demands from Star newspaper representatives </p><p>for contracts and concessions when he was threatened with an </p><p>incriminating file with both evidence and allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ANAP Group President Recai Delibasioglu, whose party </p><p>"saved" Gurtuna by voting in favor of the report, told poloff </p><p>that the report was merely a pretext for an AK-orchestrated </p><p>effort to unseat, or at least discredit, the Mayor. </p><p>According to Delibasioglu, AK resents the fact that Gurtuna, </p><p>who came to power as Erdogan\'s deputy with the then-Virtue </p><p>Party, has maintained his distance from the party\'s more </p><p>successful successor.  The rift between them has now grown to </p><p>the point where all bridges have been burnt.  ANAP, </p><p>meanwhile, faces a disintegrating voter base and a bleak </p><p>political future.  But with 6 Istanbul district mayors </p><p>dependent on good ties with the city mayor\'s office, ANAP </p><p>remains on good terms with Gurtuna.  The fact that </p><p>Delibasioglu also indicated that he expects to play an </p><p>important role in the upcoming and potentially lucrative </p><p>privatization of the Istanbul Natural Gas Distribution </p><p>Corporation suggests that there may have been some quid pro </p><p>quo in return for ANAP\'s support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Evliyaoglu told poloff that relations between AKP and </p><p>Gurtuna have reached new lows and that he sees Gurtuna\'s </p><p>chances of being the AK candidate for mayor in next year\'s </p><p>local elections as "one in a hundred" (i.e., as close to zero </p><p>as you can get in Turkey\'s unpredictable politics). </p><p>Evliyaoglu was particularly incensed that he had heard that </p><p>Gurtuna hoped to use his recent trip to Washington for the </p><p>American-Turkish Council Meeting to convince U.S. officials </p><p>that he remains a likely AKP candidate and to secure their </p><p>support in convincing PM Erdogan to offer him the nomination. </p><p> Evliyaoglu declined to join the delegation for the trip </p><p>precisely because he was worried that his presence might </p><p>convey the impression that Gurtuna was maintaining good ties </p><p>with AKP.  On the other hand, Muge Altas, Advisor to the </p><p>Mayor, argued to poloff that the rift between Gurtuna and AK </p><p>is not nearly as wide as others believe.  She also </p><p>downplayed, but did not deny, the rumors that Gurtuna might </p><p>be considering the Youth Party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Other high-profile names have also been floated as </p><p>possible contenders for the Istanbul Mayoralty in next year\'s </p><p>elections. Delibasioglu claimed that former Interior Minister </p><p>and ANAP parliamentarian Sadettin Tantan might be convinced </p><p>to throw his hat in the ring.  Tantan, formerly the Mayor of </p><p>Istanbul\'s Fatih district, is well-known and well-liked in </p><p>Istanbul.  In a chance meeting with poloff, however, Tantan </p><p>refused to confirm rumors about his potential candidacy.  CHP </p><p>parliamentarian and former Economy Minister Kemal Dervis is </p><p>another name that we have heard mentioned as a possible </p><p>contender, although most dismiss this as unlikely. </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  While the opposition of the toothless City </p><p>Council is clearly not one of Gurtuna\'s major worries, it is </p><p>an indication of the Mayor\'s political isolation.  The roots </p><p>of Gurtuna\'s problems with the City Council largely stem from </p><p>his refusal to politically align himself with one of the </p><p>major parties.  It is clear that relations between Gurtuna </p><p>and the Istanbul-based AK Party have been seriously strained, </p><p>but AK and Gurtuna continue to represent each other\'s best </p><p>chance to win in the upcoming local elections.  If AK\'s </p><p>popularity deteriorates significantly before next year\'s </p><p>elections, we do not rule out the possibility of a </p><p>last-minute reconciliation, or at least "alliance of </p><p>convenience," between Gurtuna and AK Party Chairman Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan.  Contenders from other parties, even names like </p><p>Tantan and Dervis, would be long-shots unless they emerge as </p><p>consensus candidates after a fundamental realignment of the </p><p>center-right or center-left parties. </p><p>QUINN </p><p></p></div>
