This view follows </p><p>the rejection by the Turkish parliament of a decision for </p><p>foreign troop deployment in Turkey.  In an interview with </p><p>the Turkish news channel NTV, Undersecretary of State </p><p>Grossman voiced disappointment with the rejection of the </p><p>decree, but stressed that Washington respected the decision </p><p>adopted democratically by the parliament.  All papers carry </p><p>Grossman\'s remarks extensively, and put the focus on his </p><p>warnings that Turkey might miss the opportunity for playing </p><p>an active role in the restructuring of a post-war Iraq and </p><p>the region.  Grossman issued messages of hope with elements </p><p>of threat, and warned Ankara to refrain from unilateral </p><p>action in northern Iraq.  "Radikal" carried the comments of </p><p>AKP officials urging Washington to take a step forward to </p><p>help the government convince parliament and the electorate </p><p>regarding permission for foreign troop deployments on </p><p>Turkish soil.  Parliamentary speaker Arinc said that the </p><p>motion permitting U.S. troops must not be presented to the </p><p>assembly again in the same form.  U.S. teams in Turkey for </p><p>modernization of air bases and harbors have suspended work </p><p>until permission is voted by the parliament, papers report. </p><p>Diplomatic sources think that if a second vote by parliament </p><p>is delayed, the U.S. might merely ask the GOT to use bases </p><p>and airspace.  `Negotiations with the U.S. continue.  The </p><p>parliamentary decision is merely a stage in this open-ended </p><p>process,\' Foreign Minister Yakis said.  Meanwhile, thousands </p><p>of Kurds staged an anti-Turkish rally in Erbil on Monday, </p><p>burning Turkish flags and chanting "`Yes\' to U.S. troops, </p><p>`No\' to Turks."  Papers quote a high-level MFA official as </p><p>saying that a sovereign Kurdish state would be regarded by </p><p>Ankara as a cause for war.  "Hurriyet" recalls that in March </p><p>1991, it was Turkey that provided 500,000 fleeing Kurds </p><p>shelter and food while the international community chose </p><p>only to observe the tragedy.  "Radikal" claims that </p><p>`diplomatic sources\' have said that the U.S. participation </p><p>in the latest Iraqi opposition meeting held in northern Iraq </p><p>encouraged the Kurds to display this kind of reaction to </p><p>Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas has urged the UN to </p><p>draft a new Cyprus plan through consultations with the two </p><p>sides on the divided island.  Denktas said he was in no </p><p>hurry, since the Greek Cypriots would join the EU in any </p><p>case.  He is expected to visit Ankara this week before </p><p>meeting with Annan and Papadopoulos at The Hague on March 10 </p><p>to discuss the referendum issue proposed by the UN Secretary </p><p>General.  Reports comment that Ankara was skeptical about </p><p>the referendum issue as well.  As a guarantor state, Turkey </p><p>is concerned about putting a `reluctant signature\' on the </p><p>ambiguous document.  "Cumhuriyet" cites the Greek Cypriot </p><p>daily "Fileleftheros" interview with Tom Weston, in which </p><p>the U.S. Special Coordinator for Cyprus voiced satisfaction </p><p>about the attitude of Ankara, and particularly of AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan, regarding the Cyprus problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/Turkish parliament\'s decision </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Ankara-Washington line for a second decree" </p><p>Hasan Cemal wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (3/4): "It seems </p><p>that the AKP administration is going through a kind of brain- </p><p>storming to determine the best possible atmosphere to re- </p><p>introduce the authorization decree to the parliament.  There </p><p>is speculation about a second decree to be introduced in the </p><p>event that certain steps are taken by the Bush </p><p>administration with respect to the Turkomen and Iraqi Kurds, </p><p>as well as some new economic gestures.  Another fact here is </p><p>that the Turkish military is unhappy about the denial of </p><p>permission by the parliament. . The chances for introducing </p><p>a second decree are very small prior to the election in </p><p>Siirt province on March 9.  Yet the fact of the matter is </p><p>that the chances might be completely gone if Washington </p><p>closes the door to Turkey." </p><p>"A proud yet strategically short-sighted decision" </p><p>Erhan Basyurt commented in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (3/4): </p><p>"The parliament made a proud decision, yet it also contains </p><p>the risk of being short-sighted in terms of Turkey\'s </p><p>strategic interests.  The decision validates Turkey\'s </p><p>concerns about northern Iraq.  The recent anti-Turkey </p><p>demonstrations and other signs indicate that the Iraqi Kurds </p><p>will focus more on achieving independence. . It would be </p><p>wrong, however, for the government to produce a similar </p><p>authorization decree in the short term.  Leaving it to the </p><p>flow of time and waiting until certain issues are clarified </p><p>looks like a more reasonable approach at this stage.  In </p><p>that respect, Turkish parliamentary approval for the second </p><p>decree might be an easier task if the UNSC passes a second </p><p>resolution on March 7." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who is behind the anti-Turkish sentiment: Kurds or the US?" </p><p>Fatih Altayli argued in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/4): "The US </p><p>has started playing its `Kurdish card\' in an ugly way.   It </p><p>is the US who deliberately provokes the anti-Turkey </p><p>sentiment in northern Iraq.  Evidently this is part of US </p><p>planning, but the demonstrations went beyond the limits by </p><p>burning the Turkish flag.  The timing of these events is </p><p>worth thinking about. . Oddly enough, the Turkish </p><p>parliament\'s decision prevents an American-Turkish </p><p>intervention in northern Iraq, and this is exactly what the </p><p>Kurdish groups want.  Thus they should be thanking the </p><p>Turkish parliament instead of burning the flags. . The US is </p><p>playing a dirty game in northern Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
