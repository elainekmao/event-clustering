<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000557 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC-ORGANIZED STAYAWAY SHUTS DOWN URBAN CENTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 546 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A majority of businesses in Harare and other </p><p>Zimbabwean cities complied with the opposition MDC\'s call for </p><p>a national stayaway on March 18.  It is unclear how many </p><p>employees stayed at home because they agreed with the </p><p>stayaway\'s political objectives and how many were simply </p><p>unable to find transport.  There were unconfirmed reports of </p><p>trouble in some of Harare\'s high-density suburbs, including </p><p>stoning and burning of some commuter omnibuses and erection </p><p>of road barricades by MDC youths.  Police have deployed in </p><p>force to Harare\'s high-density suburbs and are determined to </p><p>quash any protests before they spread.  A military helicopter </p><p>was seen patrolling the skies over Harare.  Many businesses </p><p>have told us they plan to close on March 19 for the second </p><p>day of the called stayaway, primarily to avoid subjecting </p><p>their workers to the potentially risky task of finding public </p><p>transport to and from work.  The success of the second day of </p><p>the announced stayaway -- on March 19 -- will be a key test </p><p>of the MDC\'s political heft.  The opposition party is pleased </p><p>with the results of the first day and is contemplating an </p><p>attempt to organize street protests on March 19, beginning in </p><p>the capital\'s high-density areas.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Large-scale participation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Significant numbers of Zimbabweans in urban centers </p><p>have complied with the opposition MDC\'s call for a national </p><p>stayaway on March 18.  In a midday drive around Harare, </p><p>polchief observed that approximately 50-60 percent of retail </p><p>outlets and some banks in the central business district were </p><p>closed, with many of the normally full parking spaces </p><p>available, and pedestrian and vehicular traffic noticeably </p><p>lighter than normal.  The entire industrial area looked like </p><p>a ghost town, with virtually every business shut down. </p><p>Colgate Palmolive, whose experience appeared to be typical of </p><p>that of most large companies in Harare, was barely able to </p><p>function, as 75 percent of its work force did not make it to </p><p>work.  A large insurance company reported that only about 20 </p><p>percent of its workers from high-density suburbs made it to </p><p>work, but most of those arrived late because of transport </p><p>problems.  Many companies which remained open told us they </p><p>planned to release their workers by early afternoon, to give </p><p>them plenty of time to find transport home. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In the second-largest city of Bulawayo, </p><p>approximately half of downtown retail outlets were closed, </p><p>while most businesses in the industrial area were closed. </p><p>Those that were open were reportedly operating at about 50 </p><p>percent capacity.  The mayor of the southern city of Masvingo </p><p>-- Alois Chaimiti -- told us that about 80 percent of </p><p>downtown shops and some banks were closed there and that </p><p>virtually no commuter omnibuses were operating.  MDC special </p><p>advisor Gandi Mudzingwa claimed to us that most businesses in </p><p>Hwange were closed, although only about 30 percent of </p><p>companies in the eastern city of Mutare had agreed to close. </p><p>In the central Zimbabwean city of Gweru, ten percent of </p><p>workers at Bata Shoes did not show up for work at the </p><p>company\'s three plants. </p><p> </p><p>Violence </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) It is impossible to discern how many Zimbabweans </p><p>stayed away from work because they agreed with the stayaway\'s </p><p>political objectives, and how many had simply been unable to </p><p>find transport.  In many of Harare\'s high-density suburbs, </p><p>MDC youths successfully prevented commuter omnibuses from </p><p>transporting people to work.  In Hatfield, Glenview, </p><p>Kuwadzana, Tafara, Epworth, and Mabvuku, roads were </p><p>reportedly blocked by improvised barricades of rocks and, in </p><p>some cases, burning tires.  Some public and private vehicles </p><p>that stopped to pick up passengers were stoned.  A private </p><p>bus operator in Glenview dispatched his buses to the area as </p><p>usual the morning of March 18 but pulled them back after </p><p>stoning incidents.  We have heard unconfirmed reports of </p><p>vehicles -- primarily commuter omnibuses -- being burnt in </p><p>the high- and medium-density suburbs for daring to take </p><p>people to work, including Mabvuku, Rugare, Epworth, Zengeza, </p><p>Kambuzuma, and Braeside.  It is unclear whether these are all </p><p>separate incidents or multiple reports of the same event.  In </p><p>Hatfield, a bread delivery truck and a long-distance ZUPCO </p><p>bus were reportedly torched. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Only 28 of USAID\'s 67 FSN employees made it to work </p><p>today, while 15 percent of State and CDC FSN\'s were absent. </p><p>In Hatcliff, a custodian at CDC was roughed up by six men who </p><p>demanded to know why he was going to work -- his forearm was </p><p>injured and he narrowly escaped a head injury from a thrown </p><p>rock.  The Embassy has encouraged FSN\'s who may have trouble </p><p>travelling to their homes in high-density areas to leave </p><p>early. </p><p> </p><p>Government reaction </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Determined to prevent large numbers of demonstrators </p><p>from getting into the city center, police established </p><p>roadblocks on most of the major arteries leading into town. </p><p>Police presence has been heavy in some high-density suburbs </p><p>and, on March 18, armored police vehicles have been observed </p><p>entering some of these areas.  Interestingly, there was </p><p>almost no overt police presence in downtown Harare, </p><p>suggesting that police are focusing on the current trouble </p><p>spots in high-density suburbs.  MDC advisor Mudzingwa claimed </p><p>that police forces are stretched very thin at the moment, and </p><p>that many of them have been deployed since the early morning </p><p>hours and are exhausted.  A military helicopter has been </p><p>patrolling the skies over Harare, with a gunner visibly in </p><p>position.  We have heard unconfirmed reports of armed forces </p><p>being deployed to some trouble spots and are trying to verify </p><p>these. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The MDC has to be pleased with the results of day </p><p>one of the stayaway, as they have demonstrated the capacity </p><p>to shut down large sectors of the economy.  The real test of </p><p>the party\'s political heft, however, will be whether they are </p><p>able to sustain this effort through at least a second day and </p><p>perhaps beyond.  The evening of March 18, the MDC plans to </p><p>assess the success of the mass action so far and determine </p><p>whether to proceed with street protests on March 19, </p><p>beginning in the high-density suburbs.  Police have so far </p><p>been able to contain incidents of violence but we have no </p><p>doubt that any attempts to expand violent confrontation will </p><p>be met with overwhelming force, including deployment of </p><p>military forces. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The day\'s events have not affected Embassy </p><p>operations or the low-density residential areas in which our </p><p>American families live. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
