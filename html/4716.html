<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008976 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY POST-COPENHAGEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8881 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5:(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Turkey is reacting with disappointment and </p><p>resignation to the EU\'s decision at the Dec. 12-13 Copenhagen </p><p>summit: 1) to review Turkey\'s EU accession bid in December </p><p>2004, withholding a definite date to start formal accession </p><p>talks; and 2) to admit Cyprus as a member before a settlement </p><p>has been reached on the island.  At the same time, the Turks </p><p>are beginning to walk back from some of their more dire </p><p>pronouncements of catastrophe in the event things didn\'t go </p><p>exactly as they hoped.  Indeed, while the outcome of </p><p>Copenhagen is short of Turkey\'s over-inflated expectations, </p><p>it marks a real improvement in Turkey\'s prospects for </p><p>eventual membership.  Our task will be to help the GOT avoid </p><p>getting bogged down in a search for scapegoats -- including </p><p>the U.S., despite strong USG support for Turkey\'s cause.  Our </p><p>public and private statements therefore, should exude </p><p>confidence that the results -- while not everything Turkey </p><p>wanted -- reinforce Turkey\'s inevitable move toward EU.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Reaction: More Determination, "No Anger" </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Speaking at a joint press conference from Copenhagen </p><p>Dec. 13, AK Chairman R. Tayyip Erdogan and P.M. Gul conveyed </p><p>disappointment but determination to continue along the EU </p><p>path. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gul adopted a low-key approach.  While offering obliquely </p><p>that "some new conditions were added to the Copenhagen </p><p>Criteria,"  Gul reiterated that Turkey had done everything in </p><p>its power to press for an early date for formal EU accession </p><p>talks.  Noting that Turkey had "many potentialities" in </p><p>foreign policy, he asserted that "the place of the </p><p>(pro-)European perspective will be preserved," and that his </p><p>Government remains firmly on the path to reform.  "Our target </p><p>is definite." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Erdogan noted that Turkey had been seeking to begin formal </p><p>accession talks with the EU in 2003, but that the EU "delayed </p><p>this a little...We will start accession talks in 2004" on the </p><p>basis of the Copenhagen Criteria; any other condition...is </p><p>out of the question."  He added that "anger is unacceptable </p><p>in politics." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>The Blame Game </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In the run-up to Copenhagen, the Turks painted </p><p>themselves into a corner by adopting a maximalist demand for </p><p>a 2003 date to begin formal accession talks with the EU -- </p><p>and by raising the specter of a "train wreck" if Cyprus was </p><p>admitted to the EU prior to a "just" settlement.  Senior MFA </p><p>officials began to warn us stridently against presenting </p><p>Turkey with a "fait accompli" on Cyprus, terming the UNSYG\'s </p><p>plan as unacceptably flawed.  Meanwhile, the AK Party came to </p><p>power, decrying the traditional, "pointlessly hawkish" Cyprus </p><p>stance, and the foot-dragging on EU-related political and </p><p>human rights reform that characterized earlier governments. </p><p>Nevertheless, by early December, after receiving what MFA </p><p>officials described as "education" of quick learners on </p><p>Cyprus and other issues, AK began to take the position that </p><p>Cyprus could be solved only with a "positive" outcome from </p><p>the EU summit -- defined as a clear, early date for the start </p><p>of EU talks.  A certain bullying posture entered some of the </p><p>exchanges between Turkey and EU members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Far from helping the Turks achieve their aims, such </p><p>tactics only tarnished the solid improvement in Turkey\'s EU </p><p>prospects that actually came out of the summit: a date for </p><p>review and a promise of negotiations if Turkey\'s reforms </p><p>continue and are implemented (unthinkable had the Ecevit </p><p>Government still been in power).  Turkey\'s tactics have also </p><p>left it in an awkward position regarding and EU deal it said </p><p>24 hours ago was not acceptable, and a Republic of Cyprus in </p><p>the EU in a manner the GOT has been describing for months as </p><p>disastrous. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Scapegoating? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Press reports in the days before the summit suggested </p><p>Turkey would uphold national honor in the event of </p><p>"humiliation" at Copenhagen by taking "punitive" action </p><p>against select European countries.  Meanwhile, the GOT -- </p><p>politicians and bureaucrats -- pushed hard for strong USG </p><p>support of its interests regarding the EU and Cyprus.  Even </p><p>before the dust settled at Copenhagen, Turks began to cast </p><p>about for scapegoats.  These include the USG.  One columnist, </p><p>known for reflecting the views of senior State officials, </p><p>suggested that USG support for Turkey in the run-up to the </p><p>summit was "counterproductive" and had only antagonized </p><p>Europeans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>What To Do </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) We will continue stressing to the Turks, particularly </p><p>the AK Government/Party, that they need to continue </p><p>accentuating the positive aspects of the outcome of </p><p>Copenhagen.  AK at T-2 is spinning the results in a moderate </p><p>fashion (though Bulent Arinc, the President of the Turkish </p><p>Grand National Assembly and a senior AK member, called the </p><p>2004 date "not positive").  We need to support that </p><p>direction.  In the days before the summit, AK officials </p><p>privately asserted to us that their aggressive approach </p><p>regarding an EU date was "only tactics."  The Gul Government </p><p>and Erdogan see EU ties as essential: 1) in their bid to </p><p>change the political status quo and counter resistance from </p><p>an entrenched State Establishment; and 2) to justifying </p><p>reform to that Establishment as both a normative and </p><p>"strategic" imperative for Turkey.  They are already </p><p>signaling a willingness to move ahead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- AK can take much credit, for pushing Copenhagen Criteria </p><p>reforms hard and right out of the gate (ref A).  Indeed, such </p><p>progress would have been unthinkable had AK not replaced the </p><p>Ecevit Government on Nov. 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Financial markets can accept an outcome along lines of </p><p>that proposed by French and Germans.  Although disappointed, </p><p>investors see it as confirmation that Turkey will be anchored </p><p>to the EU. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
