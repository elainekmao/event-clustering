<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 PHNOM PENH 001740 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PHUM, OIIP, CB </p><p>SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WINS LIBEL CASE AGAINST </p><p>NEWSPAPER </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  A RECENT DEFAMATION/LIBEL CASE AGAINST THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S LEADING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER, THE CAMBODIA </p><p>DAILY, HAS JOURNALISTS CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR </p><p>POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE USE OF ANTI-DEFAMATION LAWS </p><p>AND PLIANT COURTS TO INTIMIDATE JOURNALISTS AND PREVENT THEM </p><p>FROM PUBLISHING CONTROVERSIAL STORIES.  WHILE THERE IS NO </p><p>CLEAR PATTERN OF SUCH ABUSE OF PRESS FREEDOM, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER HOR NAMHONG WON A DEFAMATION SUIT IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>AGAINST THREE CAMBODIA DAILY JOURNALISTS WHO PUBLISHED A </p><p>QUOTE LINKING HIM TO ATROCITIES COMMITTED DURING THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE REGIME. USING THE UNTAC-PERIOD CRIMINAL CODE RATHER </p><p>THAN THE MORE RECENT PRESS LAW, THE COURT FOUND THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS GUILTY AND ORDERED THEM TO PRINT A RETRACTION </p><p>AND PAY TOTAL FINES OF ABOUT $7,500 TO HOR NAMHONG AND THE </p><p>STATE.  SOME JOURNALISTS AND LEGAL OBSERVERS CHARGE THAT THE </p><p>COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE IRREGULAR, AND BOTH SIDES HAVE </p><p>ANNOUNCED THEY WILL APPEAL THE RULING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. IN JANUARY 2001, AT THE TIME OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE </p><p>OVER THE KHMER ROUGE TRIBUNAL LAW, THE CAMBODIA DAILY </p><p>PUBLISHED TWO ARTICLES LINKING CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>HOR NAMHONG TO THE KHMER ROUGE REGIME AND KILLINGS AT THE </p><p>INFAMOUS TUOL SLENG PRISON. ACCORDING TO QUOTES ATTRIBUTED </p><p>TO FUNCINPEC PARTY SENATOR KEO BUNTHOUK, HOR NAMHONG, AS THE </p><p>INMATE LEADER OF THE KHMER ROUGE RE-EDUCATION CENTER AND </p><p>PRISON AT BOEUNG TRABEK, SENT FELLOW INMATES TO THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE INTERROGATION CENTER AND PRISON AT TUOL SLENG, AND </p><p>THESE FELLOW INMATES WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN.  SENATOR KEO </p><p>BUNTHOUK WAS ALSO A PRISONER IN BOEUNG TRABEK. HOR NAMHONG </p><p>IS KNOWN FOR HIS SENSITIVITY ABOUT ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING </p><p>HIS ROLE AT BOEUNG TRABEK, AND EVEN FILED A LIBEL SUIT IN </p><p>FRANCE AGAINST KING SIHANOUK OVER A SIMILAR CHARGE PRIOR TO </p><p>THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE MONARCHY IN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>3. HOR NAMHONG REPLIED THAT AS THE INMATE PRISON LEADER HE </p><p>HAD NO POWER TO SEND OTHER PRISONERS TO TUOL SLENG. </p><p>CLAIMING DEFAMATION AND LIBEL, HE FILED SUIT IN PHNOM PENH </p><p>MUNICIPAL COURT AGAINST THE CAMBODIA DAILY\'S U.S. CITIZEN </p><p>EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, A U.S. CITIZEN REPORTER AND A CAMBODIAN </p><p>REPORTER.  THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS SUBSEQUENTLY LEFT THE </p><p>COUNTRY, FOR REASONS NOT CONNECTED TO THE LAW SUIT. </p><p> </p><p>4. DURING THE TRIAL IN SEPTEMBER 2001, SENATOR KEO BUNTHOUK </p><p>TESTIFIED THAT SHE HAD NEVER MADE THE COMMENTS TO THE </p><p>REPORTER LINKING HOR NAMHONG TO KHMER ROUGE KILLINGS.  HOR </p><p>NAMHONG ALSO PRODUCED TWO OTHER WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED THAT </p><p>THEY WERE AT THE BOEUNG TRABEK PRISON AND THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER HAD NO POWER TO ORDER THE KILLING OF OTHER INMATES. </p><p>THE CAMBODIA DAILY ARGUED THAT THE INFORMATION PRINTED IN </p><p>THE ARTICLE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT QUOTES TAKEN FROM THE </p><p>SENATOR DURING DEBATE COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LIBEL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DURING THE TRIAL, THE JUDGE REFUSED A DEFENSE REQUEST TO </p><p>TRY THE CASE UNDER THE PRESS LAW, RATHER THAN THE OLDER AND </p><p>LESS APPROPRIATE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE U.N. TRANSITIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA (UNTAC).  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPAL COURT </p><p>JUDGE ISSUED HER VERDICT BASED ON BOTH LAWS.   ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>21, THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST THE JOURNALISTS, AND ORDERED </p><p>THEM TO PAY $6,250 DAMAGES TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND </p><p>$1,250 IN FINES TO THE STATE.  IN ADDITION, THE JOURNALISTS </p><p>WERE ORDERED TO PAY TO HAVE THE VERDICT PRINTED IN THE </p><p>CAMBODIA DAILY, RASMEI KAMPUCHEA AND KOH SANTEPHEAP </p><p>NEWSPAPERS.  FAILURE TO PAY THE FINES AND COST OF PRINTING </p><p>THE VERDICT WOULD RESULT IN JAIL SENTENCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE DECISION OF THE COURT WAS WIDELY CONDEMNED BY </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND LEGAL EXPERTS, WHO QUESTIONED THE FAIRNESS </p><p>OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  EDITORS FROM THE CAMBODIA DAILY CHARGE </p><p>THAT THE JUDGE APPLIED THE LAW SELECTIVELY, AND THAT SHE </p><p>REFUSED TO ADMIT RELEVANT EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE, </p><p>SUCH AS TAPE RECORDINGS THAT WOULD ALLEGEDLY HAVE PROVED </p><p>THAT SENATOR BUNTHOUK DID INDEED MAKE THE STATEMENT THE </p><p>PAPER ATTRIBUTED TO HER.  THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THE JUDGE </p><p>WENT OUT AND OBTAINED EVIDENCE OF HER OWN, IN VIOLATION OF </p><p>HER MANDATE.  THE LAWYER FOR HOR NAMHONG WAS ALSO </p><p>DISSATISFIED WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AS </p><p>THEY WERE SEEKING USD $1 MILLION.  LAWYERS FOR BOTH SIDES </p><p>HAVE STATED THEY WILL APPEAL THE RULING, AND HAVE UNTIL </p><p>NOVEMBER 22, 2001, TO DO SO. (NOTE: THE CAMBODIA DAILY IS </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S LEADING ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER, AND IS </p><p>WIDELY READ BY POLITICAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS. IT IS </p><p>OWNED BY FORMER NEWSWEEK CORRESPONDENT AND AMERICAN CITIZEN </p><p>BERNARD KRISHER, AND FUNCTIONS AS A NON-GOVERNMENT </p><p>ORGANIZATION WITH THE STATED GOALS OF UPGRADING THE SKILLS </p><p>OF LOCAL JOURNALISTS AND STRENGTHENING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. </p><p>THE EDITOR OF THE PAPER TOLD EMBASSY THAT THEY ARE WILLING </p><p>TO PAY FOR AN APPEAL IN ORDER TO PUBLICIZE THE CASE AND </p><p>PROMOTE PRESS FREEDOM.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT: THERE IS NO CLEAR PATTERN OF ABUSE OF ANTI- </p><p>DEFAMATION LAWS AGAINST THE PRESS IN CAMBODIA.  HOWEVER, </p><p>JOURNALISTS ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS CASE COULD ESTABLISH A </p><p>NEGATIVE PRECEDENT, IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OR POWERFUL </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WILL USE FEAR OF FINANCIAL RUIN TO KEEP THE </p><p>PRESS FROM PUBLISHING EMBARRASSING STORIES.  MANY TOP </p><p>POLITICIANS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS </p><p>TO BRING LAWSUITS AGAINST PUBLICATIONS, AND THE POWER TO </p><p>INFLUENCE THE WEAK AND NOTORIOUSLY CORRUPT JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>IN THEIR FAVOR.  MOST NEWSPAPERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE </p><p>ONLY MARGINALLY FINANCIALLY VIABLE EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, AND MAY FIND THEY MUST AVOID CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>SUBJECTS OR RISK EXPENSIVE LAWSUITS THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD. </p><p> </p><p>ARVIZU </p><p></p></div>
