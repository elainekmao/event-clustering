<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IL AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PGOV, IT, IT ELAB </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT APPROVES REFERENDUM  ON KEY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00294  01 OF 02  251318Z </p><p>LABOR LAW PROVISION </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  LABOR LAW REFORM HAS BEEN A TOP CAMPAIGN </p><p>ISSUE AND A MAJOR POLITICAL PRIORITY FOR ITALIAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI, CONSUMING MUCH OF HIS AND THE GOI\'S </p><p>TIME THROUGH 2002.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT MADE A DEAL </p><p>WITH TWO OF ITALY\'S THREE MAJOR TRADE UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS, REFORM LEGISLATION HAS NOT YET BEEN </p><p>CONSIDERED IN PARLIAMENT.  NOW, THE SMALL, LEFT-WING </p><p>COMMUNIST RENEWAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED A REFERENDUM THAT </p><p>WOULD MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  PARADOXICALLY, </p><p>APPROVAL BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REFERENDUM </p><p>PROPOSAL MAY PAVE THE WAY FOR GOI EFFORTS TO REFORM </p><p>ITALIAN LABOR LAW.  THE REFERENDUM PROPOSAL, LIKE GOI </p><p>LABOR REFORM ITSELF, HAS AGAIN BROUGHT CENTER-LEFT </p><p>DIVISIONS TO THE FORE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS APPROVED A REQUEST FOR A </p><p>REFERENDUM MADE BY THE LEFTIST COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC) </p><p>PARTY TO MODIFY A KEY PROVISION OF NATIONAL LABOR LAW. </p><p>IF PASSED, THE REFERENDUM WOULD REINFORCE EXISTING LABOR </p><p>MARKET RIGIDITIES AND COMPLICATE FURTHER PM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE MORE FLEXIBILITY INTO ITALIAN LABOR </p><p>MARKETS.  IF AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF ELECTORS TAKE PART IN </p><p>THE REFERENDUM AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM APPROVE IT, THE </p><p>REFERENDUM PROPOSAL WOULD PASS.  THE GOI WILL CHOOSE A </p><p>SUNDAY BETWEEN APRIL 15 AND JUNE 15 FOR THE REFERENDUM </p><p>VOTE.  ALTHOUGH THE LEGAL PROVISION IN QUESTION WAS A </p><p>PRINCIPAL FOCAL POINT FOR POLITICAL CONFLICT IN 2002, FEW </p><p>APPEAR INTERESTED IN THE REMATCH BEING PROMOTED BY THE </p><p>RC.  INSTEAD, WE EXPECT EFFORTS, AND DEBATE, TO FOCUS ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00294  01 OF 02  251318Z </p><p>NEW LEGISLATION TO MODIFY THE PROVISION.  PASSAGE OF A </p><p>NEW LAW WOULD ANNUL A REFERENDUM FEW ARE INTERESTED IN </p><p>CONTESTING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PROVISION, ARTICLE 18 OF THE WORKERS\' STATUTE, </p><p>GOVERNS WORKERS\' ENTITLEMENT TO COMPENSATION WHEN </p><p>IMPROPERLY FIRED.  CURRENT LAW ALLOWS EMPLOYERS AT SMALL </p><p>FIRMS (FEWER THAN 15 EMPLOYEES) TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO </p><p>REINSTATE OR COMPENSATE THOSE EMPLOYEES FOUND TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN IMPROPERLY FIRED; AT LARGER ENTERPRISES, THE CHOICE </p><p>REMAINS WITH THE WORKER.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED </p><p>REFERENDUM, THIS 15-EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD WOULD BE </p><p>ABOLISHED, EFFECTIVELY EXTENDING TO ALL EMPLOYEES THE </p><p>RIGHT ENJOYED BY WORKERS AT LARGER FIRMS TO CHOOSE THE </p><p>FORM OF COMPENSATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN 2001, THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT PRESENTED REFORM </p><p>OF ARTICLE 18 AS A CORNERSTONE OF EMPLOYMENT POLICIES </p><p>AIMED AT INTRODUCING MORE FLEXIBILITY INTO THE LABOR </p><p>MARKET.  THE THREE MAIN TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER THE PACKAGE PROPOSED AND </p><p>ORGANIZED A JOINT GENERAL STRIKE IN APRIL.  AFTER THE </p><p>STRIKE, TWO OF THE CONFEDERATIONS, CISL AND UIL, RESUMED </p><p>NEGOTIATION WITH THE MINISTER OF LABOR AND EVENTUALLY </p><p>REACHED AGREEMENT FOR A FUTURE AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE 18. </p><p>(UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE GOI WOULD HAVE PROPOSED THAT, </p><p>ON A TRIAL BASIS, COMPANIES CROSSING THE THRESHOLD OF 15 </p><p>WORKERS BE EXEMPT FROM THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 18.) </p><p>BUT CGIL, THE LARGEST AND FURTHEST LEFT OF THE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS, CONSIDERED ARTICLE 18 A KEY SYMBOLIC </p><p>RIGHT THAT COULD NOT BE MODIFIED.  THE ENSUING CONFLICT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00294  01 OF 02  251318Z </p><p>OVER THE PROVISION SPLIT BOTH THE CENTER-LEFT PARTIES AND </p><p>THE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS.  SERGIO COFFERATI, THE </p><p>FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF CGIL, USED THE DISAGREEMENT </p><p>OVER ARTICLE 18 TO GALVANIZE OPPOSITION TO THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT,  BREAKING THE COMMON TRADE UNION STAND.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, COMMUNIST RENEWAL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE TO GATHER SIGNATURES FOR A REFERENDUM </p><p>DESIGNED TO EXTEND ARTICLE 18 TO ALL COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\'S RECENT RULING AND A NEW </p><p>GOI APPROACH HAVE TRANSFORMED THE REFORM OF ARTICLE 18 </p><p>FROM A SYMBOLIC REFORM TO A PRAGMATIC ISSUE TO BE TACKLED </p><p>BY THE PARLIAMENT.  EVEN COFFERATI RECENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT HOLDING THE REFERENDUM TODAY COULD LEAD TO A DEEP </p><p>SPLIT IN THE ALREADY-FRACTURED CENTER-LEFT.  1IN THE </p><p>DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT (DS), AS WELL AS IN CGIL, THERE ARE </p><p>DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THE EXTENSION OF ARTICLE 18.  PIERO </p><p>FASSINO, THE LEADER OF DS, ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD </p><p>PROPOSE SOON A REVISION OF THE LAW THAT, IF APPROVED, </p><p>WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CANCEL THE REFERENDUM.  THE STRATEGY </p><p>OF THE DAISY PARTY (PART OF THE OLIVE TREE COALITION WITH </p><p>DS), HOWEVER, WOULD BE TO HOLD THE REFERENDUM AND </p><p>ENCOURAGE ITS SUPPORTERS TO VOTE NO, IN ORDER TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT ITS INTENTION NOT TO INTRODUCE NEW LEGAL </p><p>RESTRICTIONS FOR SMALL COMPANIES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITS </p><p>DISTINCTION FROM THE RADICAL LEFT, LIKE RC.

COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH LARGELY UNWELCOME TO THE MORE </p><p>MAINSTREAM PARTIES ON THE LEFT, THE RC\'S REFERENDUM </p><p>PROPOSAL ULTIMATELY MAY PROVE TO BE THE PUSH NEEDED TO </p><p>GET SERIOUS WORK STARTED ON LABOR MARKET REFORM AND A NEW </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SCHEME PROPOSED BY THE GOI. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>_______________________________ </p><p>1THE REFORM OF ART. 18 INITIALLY PROPOSED BY THE GOI WAS </p><p>OPPOSED BY THE DAISY PARTY, THE DS, RC, CGIL, CISL AND </p><p>UIL. SO: IT "GAVE NEW STRENGTH TO THE CENTER-LEFT" AND </p><p>UNITY. TODAY IT SEEMS THAT THE REFERENDUM WOULD SPLIT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION: RC, A COMPONENT OF DS AND A COMPONENT OF CGIL </p><p>WOULD VOTE YES; THE DAISY, A COMPONENT OF DS AND A </p><p>COMPONENT OF CGIL WOULD VOTE NO. THE STATEMENT OF </p><p>COFFERATI HELPS UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL </p><p>MEANINGS OF THE REFORMS OF ART. 18. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00294 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
