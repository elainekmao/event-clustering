<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000673 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, RW </p><p>SUBJECT: THE KABILA GOVERNMENT:  THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR AUBREY HOOKS FOR REASONS 1/5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p>1.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSEPH KABILA FEELS MUCH PUT UPON </p><p>THESE DAYS AND FRUSTRATED THAT IT HAS FEW OPTIONS TO EXERCISE </p><p>IN TERMS OF SHAPING THE WORLD AROUND IT.  IT IS FEELING THE </p><p>PRESSURE OF OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOG </p><p>(ICD) FOR WHICH IT WAS ILL PREPARED, IT HAS BEEN HUMILIATED </p><p>IN MOLIRO, ITS ALLIES ARE GIVING TEPID SUPPORT AS THEY PURSUE </p><p>THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REMAINS </p><p>RESERVED.  KABILA VALUES USG APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGEMENT, AND </p><p>THAT GIVES US SOME LIMITED LEVERAGE TO INFLUENCE HIM TO </p><p>CONTINUE REFORMS TO TO GRAPPLE WITH TOUGH DECISIONS HE NEEDS </p><p>TO MAKE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE FRACTURED OPPOSITION -- ARMED REBEL GROUPS, </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES, AND CIVIL SOCIETY -- ARE UNITED ON ONE </p><p>BASIC POINT:  THEY WANT A SLICE OF THE PIE IN KINSHASA.  THE </p><p>ARMED GROUPS CONTROL AROUND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT </p><p>THEY DO NOT CONTROL KINSHASA AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE THIN </p><p>VENEER OF LEGITIMACY THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION </p><p>ACCORDS TO KABILA.  THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND CIVIC GROUPS </p><p>ARE HUNGRY AND JUST WANT IN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  UNFORTUNATELY, THE KABILA GOVERNMENT HAS ILL </p><p>PREPARED ITSELF FOR THE ICD IN SUN CITY.  THE GOVERNMENT, TO </p><p>ITS CREDIT, DID MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA OF </p><p>THE MLC.  THE FACT THAT THESE OVERTURES HAVE NOT BORNE MUCH </p><p>FRUIT IS AS MUCH DUE TO THE UNBRIDLED AMBITIONS OF BEMBA AS </p><p>IT IS TO THE HALF-HEARTED NATURE OF KABILA\'S EFFORTS. </p><p>ONUSUMBA OF THE RCD, VERY MUCH UNDER RWANDA\'S THUMB, IS </p><p>BASICALLY BEYOND THE PALE AND WOULD ONLY BE COURTED AS AN </p><p>ALLY BY KABILA AS A VERY LAST RESORT.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MADE ONLY SPORADIC EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT DID MANAGE TO </p><p>PERSUADE MASIRE TO ENLARGE THE POLITICAL PARTY CONTINGENT TO </p><p>INCLUDE SOME POLITICAL FIGURES COOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>ONLY AT THE COST OF ANTAGONIZING WHAT PASSES AS THE POLITICAL </p><p>CLASS IN KINSHASA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE KABILA GOVERNMENT IS HAVING TROUBLE COMING TO </p><p>GRIPS WITH THE IDEA OF SHARING POWER.  CERTAINLY, LAURENT </p><p>KABILA NEVER CAME TO GRIPS WITH THAT CONCEPT.  JOSEPH HAS </p><p>COME TO THAT CONCLUSION ONLY RELUCTANTLY AND AT GREAT </p><p>RESISTANCE WITHIN HIS OWN CAMP, BUT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN </p><p>LITTLE THOUGHT AS TO HOW TO APPROACH THE NEGOTIATIONS OTHER </p><p>THAN TRYING TO PUT HIS OWN POSITION AS PRESIDENT OFF LIMITS. </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH KABILA AND FOREIGN MINISTER OKITUNDU (THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IN SUN CITY) INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT CAME UP WITH HARD-LINE OPENING POSITIONS AND, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THE REACTIONS, WILL THEN ADJUST THOSE POSITIONS. </p><p> IT HAS GIVEN LITTLE THOUGHT TO FALLBACK POSITIONS, LET ALONE </p><p>DEVELOPING AN ACTIVE STRATEGY TO GUIDE THE INEVITABLE </p><p>COMPROMISES THAT MUST EMERGE AT THE ICD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT MADE TACTICAL ERRORS IN WALKING OUT </p><p>OF THE ICD BOTH IN ADDIS ABABA AND IN SUN CITY. KABILA AND </p><p>OKITUNDU ARE AWARE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS </p><p>QUESTIONING THE GOVERNNENT\'S COMMITMENT TO THE DIALOG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOLIRO HUMILIATION </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE FALL OF MOLIRO, A SMALL BUT STRATEGIC PORT ON </p><p>LAKE TANGANYIKA, ON MARCH 16 TO RCD FORCES HAS BEEN A PAINFUL </p><p>HUMILIATION TO THE GOVERNMENT. BUT EVEN IN THE CASE OF </p><p>MOLIRO, THE GOVERNMENT GARNERS LITTLE SYMPATHY AS THE WRONGED </p><p>PARTY.  THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT DECLARE MOLIRO AS A NEW </p><p>DEFENSIVE POSITION IN THE HARARE SUB-ACCORDS AND THUS WAS IN </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  FURTHERMORE, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD BEEN GUILTY OF USING MOLIRO AS A BASE FOR SUPPLYING </p><p>MAI-MAI AND HUTU MILITIAMEN AND FOR HARRASSING RCD AND </p><p>RWANDAN FORCES NORTH ALONG THE LAKE SHORE, SOMETHING WHICH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT CONSISTENTLY DENIED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NO MILITARY OPTION </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE HUMILIATION DOES NOT STOP WITH THE FALL OF </p><p>MOLIRO.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE FOND OF REPEATING THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT FORCES WERE NOT DEFEATED ON THE BATTLE FIELD, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE MANAGED TO LOSE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE </p><p>COUNTY.  THAT IS DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THE CONGOLESE </p><p>ARMED FORCES (FAC) IS BY AND LARGE A RAGTAG ARMY MORE GIVEN </p><p>TO FLIGHT THAN TO FIGHT. ALLIES ZIMBABWE AND ANGOLA SEEM </p><p>LITTLE INCLINED TO GET MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN CONGO EXCEPT </p><p>TO PROTECT THEIR OWN INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT REALIZES THAT </p><p>TODAY IT HAS LITTLE TO NO MILITARY OPTION TO EXERCISE, SHOULD </p><p>POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS FAIL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNDER APPRECIATED </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  JOSEPH KABILA IS PUZZLED THAT HIS EFFORTS ARE NOT </p><p>FULLY APPRECIATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HIS </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS HAVE BEEN MET WITH MILD </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN EMBRACED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SENSE OF DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK ARE THE MOST </p><p>RESPONSIVE, BUT EVEN THERE HE IS HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY </p><p>MEETING THEIR MINIMAL STANDARDS THAT WILL LEAD TO ASSISTANCE </p><p>IN THE SHORT TERM.  KABILA\'S EFFORTS AT DDRRR HAVE EARNED HIM </p><p>AS MUCH CRITICISM AS THEY HAVE CREDIT.  NO DOUBT IT TOOK </p><p>GREAT EFFORT ON HIS PART TO OVERCOME THE OBJECTIONS OF </p><p>MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY KONGOLO AND OTHERS IN CANTONING </p><p>1,800 (AND NOT THE 3,000 HE FIRST ANNOUNCED) IN KAMINA, BUT </p><p>THE DELAYING TACTICS OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE FLIRTING WITH </p><p>THE RWANDAN OPPOSITION GROUP FDLR PRECLUDED A POSITIVE </p><p>REACTION FROM RWANDA.  EVEN HIS PROPOSAL TO THE UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL TO FORM A COMMISSION TO MOVE DDRRR FORWARD AROUSED </p><p>LITTLE INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE USG </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE KABILA GOVERNMENT APPEARS BUFFETED BY EVENTS </p><p>WITH NO COHERENT STRATEGIC VISION OF HOW TO SHAPE THE </p><p>POLITICAL TRANSITION IN CONGO.  KABILA NEEDS AND WANTS USG </p><p>APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGEMENT, ALTHOUGH HE WOULD PREFER THAT </p><p>BOTH TAKE ON MORE CONCRETE FORM IN TERMS OF ASSISTANCE AND </p><p>COOPERATION.  WE THEREFORE HAVE SOME (ALBEIT LIMITED) </p><p>LEVERAGE TO INFLUENCE HIM TO CONTINUE REFORMS AND TO GRAPPLE </p><p>WITH AT LEAST SOME OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS FACING HIM, HELPING </p><p>HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT, WHILE THE ICD MAY NOT BE A VERY </p><p>COMFORTABLE FIT, LIKE CINDERELLA, HE HAS TO SQUEEZE HIS FOOT </p><p>INTO THE DIALOG SHOE IF HE IS GOING TO GET CONGO BACK ON </p><p>TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
