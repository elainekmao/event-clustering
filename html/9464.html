<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004417 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, SY, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: US-FUNDED NEIRAB REFUGEE HOUSING PROJECT NEARS </p><p>COMPLETION, QUIETLY ENCOURAGES CHANGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires David Hale, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Embassy Damascus cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and Comment:  The first U.S.-funded units in </p><p>UNRWA\'s Neirab housing project in Syria are ready for an </p><p>August handover to Palestinian refugees, with all 28 units </p><p>scheduled for completion in December 2003.  While there have </p><p>been some delays and design problems, the project already is </p><p>having a positive impact on the refugees and the way UNRWA </p><p>does business.  Through the project, UNRWA is exploring new </p><p>approaches to social services, cost management, donor </p><p>relations and overall project management.  The project also </p><p>prompted the Syrian Government to form its first-ever camp </p><p>committees and experiment with international NGOs in a </p><p>refugee camp.  The Canadian Government approved a 6.5 million </p><p>CD (USD 4 million) contribution to the project on July 11 but </p><p>UNRWA still needs a further PRM contribution of USD 500,000 </p><p>to maintain momentum while Canada finalizes its contribution. </p><p> We recommend PRM approve the second contribution, keeping </p><p>this quiet experiment in refugee resettlement in motion.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Refcoord monitored progress on the U.S.-funded </p><p>housing project at Syria\'s Neirab and Ein Al Tal refugee </p><p>camps on June 26 and 27.  After weather-related delays during </p><p>the winter, the first group of U.S.-funded housing units is </p><p>ready for an August handover to the refugee families, who </p><p>will be responsible for finishing the units\' interiors in </p><p>accordance with UNRWA\'s self-help policy on shelter </p><p>rehabilitation.  The entire tranche of 28 U.S.-funded units </p><p>will be completed by December 2003, at which point UNRWA </p><p>would like to hold a formal inauguration ceremony and </p><p>announce further contributions to the project. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Just prior to refcoord\'s visit, UNRWA Syria Deputy </p><p>Director Lex Takkenberg selected the 28 families who will </p><p>move into the U.S.-funded units.  A total of 280 families </p><p>have now registered with UNRWA to apply to move from the </p><p>Neirab barracks and UNRWA expects the number to continue to </p><p>grow.  The 28 families were all chosen from a group </p><p>identified by the newly formed Neirab and Ein Al Tal refugee </p><p>camp committees, but UNRWA had the final say in the families\' </p><p>rank-ordering.  Priority was given to families in the worst </p><p>housing conditions, with some extra consideration given to </p><p>UNRWA special hardship cases.  Although donors (including the </p><p>U.S.) had previously expressed concern that UNRWA could </p><p>inadvertently create a new slum by moving special hardship </p><p>case families, a June 26 meeting with some of the families </p><p>selected to move revealed a far more dynamic community than </p><p>would be expected based solely on socio-economic statistics. </p><p>In one family, for example, a teenage daughter who dropped </p><p>out of school after seventh grade told refcoord that the </p><p>prospects of moving to a new home had inspired her to resume </p><p>her studies.  Another seven-person family had been forced to </p><p>move into a one-room barracks home after the disabled male </p><p>head of household lost his UNRWA special hardship benefits </p><p>and the family was unable to pay rent on the wife\'s </p><p>schoolteacher salary alone.  The move will give the children </p><p>more room to study and play. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) UNRWA recognizes that it must incorporate some </p><p>social services programming into the Ein Al Tal housing </p><p>project, to ensure that the move-generated dynamism results </p><p>in real and lasting changes in this refugee community.  To </p><p>that end, UNRWA plans to invest in greater vocational </p><p>training opportunities in the Ein Al Tal women\'s program </p><p>center and also to use seed money from the US-funded Relief </p><p>and Social Services\' microcredit lending program to establish </p><p>new consumer and home improvement lending plans (for existing </p><p>Ein Al Tal residents).  The housing loan program will be </p><p>implemented in partnership with U.S.-based NGO </p><p>Community-Habitat-Finance (CHF), a first for Syria.  The </p><p>newly created Neirab and Ein Al Tal camp committees (no camp </p><p>committees had existed in Syria prior to the initiation of </p><p>this project) also are working with UNRWA to develop their </p><p>own socio-economic development ideas for the two camps. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) A May 2003 Swiss-led technical mission to Ein Al Tal </p><p>camp revealed some design flaws in the project, which have </p><p>led to significantly higher unit costs.  UNRWA, for example, </p><p>has failed to group together the houses\' "wet units" </p><p>(kitchens and baths), added unnecessary beams and stone </p><p>facing for purely ascetic reasons, built stone perimeter </p><p>fences and sunk the foundations deeper than required.  The </p><p>Swiss Development and Cooperation Agency and the Syrian </p><p>Government estimate that UNRWA could reduce future housing </p><p>unit costs by 50 percent (to nearly USD 6,000) if the agency </p><p>corrected these design flaws.  UNRWA plans to hold a housing </p><p>policy workshop in October (with Swiss technical assistance) </p><p>to assess the US-funded construction and recommend design </p><p>corrections.  UNRWA assures us that the costs of any future </p><p>US-funded units will reflect these changes. </p><p>7.  (SBU) Amman-based CIDA representative Monika Vadeboncoeur </p><p>reported that the Canadian Government on July 11 approved a </p><p>multi-year contribution of 6.5 million Canadian dollars </p><p>(roughly USD 4 million) to phase one of the Neirab/Ein Al Tal </p><p>housing project.  The Swiss Government is ready to contribute </p><p>another USD 300,000 to the project\'s management and </p><p>communications needs.  UNRWA hopes PRM will contribute </p><p>another USD 500,000 to the project, to keep construction </p><p>moving ahead while the Canadians and Swiss finalize their </p><p>contributions. (UNRWA\'s draft project proposal has been </p><p>forwarded to PRM/ANE by e-mail.)  These contributions would </p><p>cover the entire costs of phase one of the project.  UNRWA </p><p>reports that the EU is considering a substantial contribution </p><p>to phase two of the project, renovation of the Neirab </p><p>barracks. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The Canadian and Swiss governments are pushing UNRWA </p><p>to adopt a "harmonized" approach to donors, including a </p><p>memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would set up a shared </p><p>framework for project implementation and monitoring. </p><p>Specific subjects to be covered in the MOU could include:  a </p><p>common proposal outlining the terms of the project, common </p><p>financial accountability requirements, common monitoring, </p><p>reporting and evaluation requirements and a joint stakeholder </p><p>committee (including UNRWA, donors and the SARG) to oversee </p><p>progress of the project.  UNRWA HQ has agreed to this </p><p>approach and has authorized Syria Deputy Director Takkenberg </p><p>and the Legal Department to draw up a draft MOU.  The </p><p>Canadians and Swiss also would like the harmonized approach </p><p>to include a "trust fund" for the project, a separate account </p><p>into which donors would contribute their lump-sum </p><p>contribution up-front, to finance the multi-year project. </p><p>(Refcoord already cautioned UNRWA and other donors that PRM </p><p>might not be able to participate in a trust fund.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  In addition to serving as a quiet </p><p>experiment in refugee resettlement, the Neirab/Ein Al Tal </p><p>housing project is prompting UNRWA to take a fresh look at </p><p>relief and social services policy, cost management, donor </p><p>relations and overall project management.  The project is </p><p>also prompting the Syrian Government to explore new camp </p><p>leadership policies (through the newly created camp </p><p>committees) and the potential involvement of foreign NGOs in </p><p>the refugee camps.  Many of these successes are due to the </p><p>solid work of UNRWA\'s Director and Deputy Director in Syria, </p><p>both of whom are likely to leave Syria in the next 15 months. </p><p> Donors and the Syrian Government will have to work hard to </p><p>ensure progress on the project does not end with the change </p><p>in UNRWA leadership.  Nevertheless, the project\'s potential, </p><p>far-reaching impact on the way UNRWA and host governments do </p><p>business, as well as the obvious humanitarian impact on </p><p>refugees\' lives, argues for continued US support for the </p><p>project.  We recommend PRM approve a second tranche of </p><p>funding as requested by UNRWA and that PRM participate in the </p><p>proposed "harmonized" MOU. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
