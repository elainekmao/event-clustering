THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO ASSIST IN THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCING BOTH BY SIGNING THE CONVENTION TO </p><p>SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING THIS MONTH, AND BY ITS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION ON, AND REQUEST </p><p>ASSISTANCE WITH, ITS CAPACITY TO MONITOR SUSPICIOUS </p><p>FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARRESTED </p><p>SEVERAL SUSPICIOUS THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS TRANSITTING </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AND SHARED INFORMATION FROM THOSE ARRESTS </p><p>WITH US.  IT HAS AGREED UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING </p><p>THE FIVE REMAINING ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS (INCLUDING </p><p>THE CONVENTION TO SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING, WHICH </p><p>MUST NOW BE RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT), AND HAS SET UP AN </p><p>INTER-MINSISTERIAL BODY TO DO SO.

TO THE EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE UNDER EXISTING LAWS, GHANA HAS AGREED TO </p><p>TIGHTEN ITS OVERSIGHT OF SUSPICIOUS FINANCIAL </p><p>TRANSACTIONS.  IT HAS ALSO AGREED THAT SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>REVISION OF ITS LAWS REGARDING MONEY-LAUNDERING AND </p><p>SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS IS NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE </p><p>PURSUED, AND HAS ASKED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN DOING </p><p>SO.  THE MISSION HAS LOBBIED THE GOG EXTENSIVELY ON THE </p><p>NECESSITY OF ADOPTING THE FIVE REMAINING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST CONVENTIONS, AND THE GOG HAS BEGUN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF ADOPTION. </p><p> </p><p>L.
