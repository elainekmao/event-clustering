<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 MOSCOW 31607 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PARM, KPRP, WPO, ZC, UR, GC, HU, PL </p><p>SUBJECT: CAN WARSAW PACT MEMBERS QUIT? </p><p>/        MOSCOW MAY NOT KNOW </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) MOSCOW 31520 </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. AT THE END OF OCTOBER A STIR WAS CREATED AS THREE </p><p>SOVIET SPOKESMEN STATED THAT EAST EUROPEAN STATES </p><p>WERE FREE TO QUIT THE WARSAW PACT IF THEY SO </p><p>DESIRED.  THE SOVIETS REGARD THIS AS A LOGICAL </p><p>OUTCOME OF THEIR POLICY OF "NON-INTERFERENCE IN </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS." THEY INSIST THAT THEIR EAST </p><p>EUROPEAN PARTNERS HAVE FULL "FREEDOM OF CHOICE." </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, TOP PARTY FIGURES HAVE HINTED THAT THIS </p><p>IS NOT A BLANKET FREEDOM.  IN PRIVATE, GORBACHEV AND </p><p>OTHERS HAVE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF  THE WARSAW </p><p>PACT REMAINING INTACT.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF "GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>REALITIES" IN EASTERN EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE SOVIETS STRESS THAT NO WARSAW PACT MEMBERS </p><p>HAVE EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN LEAVING THE ALLIANCE. </p><p>IN FACT, SOVIET OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>IN AN ALLY\'S NATIONAL INTEREST TO LEAVE THE PACT. </p><p>HOWEVER, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT HUNGARY </p><p>COULD EDGE TOWARD NEUTRALITY IN THE NEAR-TERM. </p><p>SOVIET LEADERS HAVE STRESSED THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY </p><p>MILITARY FORCE IN EASTERN EUROPE, REGARDLESS OF THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  IN THE SENSE OF INTERVENING </p><p>MILITARILY TO IMPOSE IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY, THE </p><p>BREZHNEV DOCTRINE APPEARS DEAD. </p><p> </p><p>4. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE COST OF TAKING MILITARY </p><p>ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST A "DEFECTING" ALLY COULD BE </p><p>ENORMOUS, BOTH IN ITS DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>IMPLICATIONS.  SHOULD HUNGARY MOVE TOWARD NEUTRALITY, </p><p>THE SOVIETS ARE LIKELY TO EMPLOY ONLY POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC MEANS TO DETER THE DECISION.  GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>REALITIES, HOWEVER, SEEM TO IMPOSE A SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>DIFFERENT SET OF TOLERANCES AS REGARDS POLAND AND THE </p><p>GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.  TRADITIONAL SOVIET </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS VIS-A-VIS THESE COUNTRIES REMAIN </p><p>HIGH AND THEIR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE WARSAW </p><p>PACT IS REGARDED BY MANY AS A FUNDAMENTAL FACTOR FOR </p><p>SOVIET SECURITY AND EUROPEAN STABILITY.  THIS MEANS </p><p>THAT DESPITE SOVIET ASSURANCES THAT FORCE WILL NOT BE </p><p>USED TO PREVENT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PACT, THERE ARE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES -- EXTREME THOUGH THEY MAY BE -- UNDER </p><p>WHICH THE PROSPECT OF SOVIET MILITARY INTERVENTION TO </p><p>PRESERVE THE VIABILITY OF THE WARSAW PACT CANNOT BE </p><p>RULED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. THIS IS THE SECOND CABLE IN A THREE-PART SERIES </p><p>ADDRESSING CURRENT SOVIET ATTITUDES TOWARD CHANGES IN </p><p>THE WARSAW PACT, WHICH WE HOPE WASHINGTON READERS </p><p>WILL FIND USEFUL IN PREPARING FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DECEMBER 2-3 MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN GORBACHEV.  OTHER </p><p>REPORTS FOCUS ON SOVIET AND EAST EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO </p><p>TRANSFORM THE WARSAW PACT FROM A MILITARY-POLITICAL </p><p>TO A POLITICAL-MILITARY ALLIANCE (SEE REFTEL), AS </p><p>WELL AS THE ROLE THE SOVIETS BELIEVE THE WARSAW PACT </p><p>SHOULD PLAY IN MAINTAINING EUROPEAN STABILITY IN THE </p><p>1990\'S AND ADVANCING EAST-WEST RELATIONS (SEPTEL TO </p><p>FOLLOW). </p><p> </p><p>6. THE SOVIET UNION INSISTS THAT IT IS NOT PREPARED </p><p>MILITARILY TO IMPOSE ITS WILL ON ITS ALLIES.  THE </p><p>DOCTRINE OF THE DAY IS "NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS," AND SOLIDARITY\'S SUCCESS IN POLAND GIVES IT </p><p>SOME CREDIBILITY.  AT HOME, GORBACHEV CONTINUES TO </p><p>PUSH A BOLD PROGRAM OF REFORM.  ABROAD, HE HAS </p><p>ACTIVELY PROMOTED THE BUILDING OF A "COMMON EUROPEAN </p><p>HOME."  HIS FOREIGN POLICY GOAL IN EASTERN EUROPE IS </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD -- STABILITY.  BY THIS HE DOES NOT </p><p>MEAN A HALT TO THE POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS, BUT </p><p>STABILITY IN TERMS OF MILITARY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND "AMIABLE" </p><p>RELATIONS.  BUT DOES THIS REQUIRE THAT EAST EUROPEAN </p><p>STATES REMAIN MEMBERS OF THE WARSAW TREATY </p><p>ORGANIZATION? </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A BARBERSHOP TRIO </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. AT THE END OF OCTOBER, THREE SOVIET OFFICIALS MADE </p><p>STATEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT EAST EUROPEAN </p><p>NATIONS WERE FREE TO LEAVE THE WARSAW TREATY </p><p>ORGANIZATION (WTO): YEVGENIY PRIMAKOV, CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE SUPREME SOVIET COUNCIL OF THE UNION; NIKOLAY </p><p>SHISHLIN, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AIDE WHO SPECIALIZES IN </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE; AND MFA PRESS SPOKESMAN GENNADIY </p><p>GERASIMOV (WHO LATER SAID HE HAD BEEN MISQUOTED). </p><p>PRIMAKOV SAID THAT WTO MEMBER STATES WERE FREE TO </p><p>LEAVE, BUT EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL BELIEF THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD NOT BE IN THEIR INTEREST.  SHISHLIN SAID THAT </p><p>HUNGARY WAS FREE TO LEAVE THE WTO, BUT WAS MORE </p><p>GUARDED WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>GDR.  FINALLY, GERASIMOV, REPEATING AN ANALOGY HE HAD </p><p>MADE IN SEPTEMBER IN ITALY, SAID THAT THE BREZHNEV </p><p>DOCTRINE HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE "FRANK SINATRA </p><p>DOCTRINE," I.E. COUNTRIES CAN SAY "I DID IT MY WAY." </p><p>(WE NOTE THAT SOVIET DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN </p><p>ABOIMOV, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE WTO POLITICAL </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON ANY OF </p><p>THE ABOVE STATEMENTS -- SEE MOSCOW 30503). </p><p> </p><p>8. WHILE IT IS UNIQUE TO HEAR SUCH A HARMONIOUS </p><p>CHORUS AT ONE TIME, SIMILAR STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE </p><p>BY SOVIET SPOKESMEN IN RECENT MONTHS.  SHISHLIN, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, MADE THE SAME REMARK ABOUT HUNGARY IN A </p><p>PARIS INTERVIEW IN SEPTEMBER.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>PRIMAKOV\'S REMARKS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO COMMENTS MADE </p><p>BY MARSHAL SERGEY AKHROMEYEV IN JULY.  AKHROMEYEV, IN </p><p>WASHINGTON TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES </p><p>COMMITTEE, SAID EAST EUROPEAN NATIONS WERE FREE TO </p><p>DECIDE WHETHER TO REMAIN IN THE PACT, BUT ADDED HE </p><p>COULD NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR SOCIALIST COUNTRIES TO </p><p>QUIT AS IT WOULD NOT BE IN THEIR INTEREST.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, AKHROMEYEV\'S STATEMENTS ECHOED REMARKS MADE </p><p>EARLIER BY OLEG BOGOMOLOV, THE DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW\'S </p><p>INSTITUTE OF THE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD SOCIALIST </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>"FREEDOM OF CHOICE" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. GORBACHEV ANNOUNCED IN HIS AUGUST 1 SPEECH TO THE </p><p>SUPREME SOVIET THAT THERE WERE NO UNIVERSAL SQCIALIST </p><p>MODELS AND THAT EACH COUNTRY\'S PEOPLE DECIDE THE </p><p>FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY THEMSELVES AND SELECT ITS </p><p>SYSTEM ON THEIR OWN.  HE INSISTED THAT NOBODY MAY </p><p>INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY OR IMPOSE </p><p>ITS VIEWS ABOUT ITS POLICY UNDER ANY PRETEXT.  THE </p><p>SOVIETS HAVE STRESSED THAT A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF </p><p>THEIR NEW POLITICAL THINKING IS FREEDOM OF CHOICE. </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER ALEKSANDR YAKOVLEV, CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>CPSU\'S INTERNATIONAL POLICY COMMISSION, SAID THAT </p><p>THIS WAS THE "MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF EAST EUROPEAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS."  SHISHLIN TOO HAS EMPHASIZED THAT THIS </p><p>POLICY MEANS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT THAT THE </p><p>SOCIALIST COUNTRIES MUST NOT EXCEED IN THEIR DOMESTIC </p><p>POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. NEVERTHELESS, THE SOVIETS HAVE MADE SOME HINTS </p><p>THAT THIS IS NOT A BLANKET FREEDOM.  IN PRIVATE TOP </p><p>SOVIET LEADERS, GORBACHEV INCLUDED, HAVE STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE WARSAW PACT REMAINING INTACT.  LAST </p><p>WEEK, YAKOVLEV TOLD ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI THAT IT WOULD </p><p>BE DESTABILIZING IF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES WERE TO PEEL </p><p>OFF FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCES.  IN ADDITION, HE </p><p>PLACED A PROVISO ON "FREEDOM OF CHOICE" -- THAT THERE </p><p>BE NO "INTERFERENCE FROM THE U.S. AND THE WEST IN </p><p>GENERAL.  SHISHLIN HAS ALSO NOTED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>CERTAIN "GEOPOLITICAL REALITIES" WHICH COUNTRIES </p><p>SHOULD NOT IGNORE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>BUT NO ONE WANTS TO LEAVE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. MFA SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION CHIEF </p><p>GORAL\'D GORINOVICH EMPHASIZED TO POLOFF THAT THE </p><p>HUNGARIAN LEADERSHIP HAD NOT RAISED THE QUESTION OF </p><p>LEAVING THE WTO, NOR HAD ANY OTHER PACT MEMBER STATE </p><p>-- "NOT HUNGARY, NOT POLAND, NOT ROMANIA."  HE SAID </p><p>THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP HAD NOT ADDRESSED THE QUESTION </p><p>OF WARSAW PACT MEMBERS POSSIBLY QUITTING THE </p><p>ALLIANCE, AS NO MEMBER HAD EXPRESSED SUCH A DESIRE. </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY LITANY OF </p><p>STATEMENTS OF FIRM AND UNDYING SUPPORT FOR THE WARSAW </p><p>PACT FROM THOSE EAST EUROPEAN STATES WHICH ARE </p><p>UNDERGOING REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>COULD HUNGARY LEAVE THE WARSAW PACT? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. NEVERTHELESS, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS WOULD NOT BE </p><p>SURPRISED IF HUNGARY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE WARSAW </p><p>PACT, BECAUSE OF ITS EXPRESSED DESIRE FOR NEUTRALITY </p><p>AND THE EXAMPLE OF NEUTRAL AUSTRIA JUST ACROSS THE </p><p>DANUBE.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THEM ARGUE THAT WERE </p><p>HUNGARY TO DO SO -- ABSENT SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM THE WEST -- IT WOULD FIND ITSELF IN </p><p>VERY DIFFICULT STRAITS.  THEY BELIEVE THAT IF HUNGARY </p><p>SEVERED ALL ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION AND ITS OTHER EASTERN NEIGHBORS, IT </p><p>COULD SIMPLY END UP CRIPPLING ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>13. HUNGARY\'S WTO PARTICIPATION IS REGARDED AS MORE </p><p>SYMBOLIC THAN SUBSTANTIAL.  LIBERAL SCHOLARS HERE </p><p>ARGUE THAT HUNGARY\'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE WTO IS NOT </p><p>REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THAT EVEN IF IT ADOPTED </p><p>NEUTRAL STATUS, THE OVERALL BALANCE OF FORCES IN </p><p>EUROPE WOULD REMAIN BASICALLY INTACT.  IN FACT, USA </p><p>INSTITUTE DEPARTMENT HEAD ANDREY KORTUNOV HAS ARGUED </p><p>THAT IN MILITARY TERMS A GREATER THREAT MIGHT BE </p><p>POSED BY COUNTRIES LIKE HUNGARY REMAINING IN THE </p><p>ALLIANCE, DUE TO THE UNRELIABILITY OF THEIR TROOPS </p><p>SHOULD A CONFLICT EVER ARISE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PERHAPS HUNGARY COULD QUIT, BUT IT\'S A SMALL FISH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>14. THE PRINCIPAL CONCERN RAISED ABOUT A HUNGARIAN </p><p>"DEFECTION" WOULD BE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF AN </p><p>ALLIANCE MEMBER QUITTING AND THE CHANCE THAT OTHER </p><p>PACT MEMBERS MIGHT DECIDE TO FOLLOW ITS EXAMPLE.  IF </p><p>HUNGARY DECIDED TO QUIT THE ALLIANCE, THERE IS LITTLE </p><p>DOUBT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD BE LOATH TO INTERVENE </p><p>MILITARILY.  INSTEAD, THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY SEEK TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE HUNGARY TO REMAIN A MEMBER BY USING </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEVERS OF INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>15. MANY OF OUR SOVIET CONTACTS BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>DEFECTION OF A LESS IMPORTANT WTO STATE, SUCH AS </p><p>HUNGARY, WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SOVIET CONSERVATIVES\' </p><p>HAND, BY PROVIDING THEM WITH YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF </p><p>HOW GORBACHEV\'S PERESTROYKA AND NEW POLITICAL </p><p>THINKING ARE UNDERMINING NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE AND OUR SOVIET CONTACTS DOUBT THAT </p><p>THIS COULD APPRECIABLY DIMINISH GORBACHEV\'S POLITICAL </p><p>POWER, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH THE DRASTIC </p><p>DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND NATIONALITY PROBLEMS THAT HE </p><p>HAS TO FACE.  THERE ARE BIGGER FISH IN THIS POND, </p><p>HOWEVER, WHOSE POSSIBLE DEFECTION COULD POSE A FAR </p><p>MORE DANGEROUS THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>A SOVIET POLICY OF "DIFFERENTIATION" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16. MFA SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION CHIEF </p><p>GORINOVICH INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE </p><p>BETWEEN HOW THE SOVIETS VIEWED HUNGARY, POLAND OR THE </p><p>GDR UNDER THE WARSAW PACT.  NIKOLAY SHISHLIN, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS HESITANT ABOUT PLACING HUNGARY AND THE </p><p>GDR IN THE SAME CATEGORY.  ANDREY KORTUNOV, HEAD OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>IUSAC, HAS SAID THAT MANY SOVIET MILITARY MEN STILL </p><p>VIEW EASTERN EUROPE IN TERMS OF BUFFER ZONES AND </p><p>DEPTH OF DEFENSE.  IN THEIR OPINION SOME EAST </p><p>EUROPEAN ALLIES, IN PARTICULAR THE GDR AND POLAND </p><p>WERE CRUCIAL TO SOVIET SECURITY INTERESTS.  YURIY </p><p>DAVYDOV, HEAD OF IUSAC\'S "EUROPEAN CENTER" HAS VOICED </p><p>SIMILAR CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE GDR: THE PACT\'S KEYSTONE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. SHISHLIN HAS STATED THAT "FREEDOM OF CHOICE" MUST </p><p>TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CERTAIN "GEO-POLITICAL REALITIES." </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS, WE HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD THIS </p><p>PHRASE VOICED IN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE OF </p><p>THE GDR.  THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT FOR THE GDR, </p><p>THESE REALITIES COULD INCLUDE THE STATIONING OF </p><p>FOREIGN TROOPS IN THE FRG AND THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE </p><p>WEST GERMAN BUNDESWEHR, IF NOT THE EXISTENCE OF NATO </p><p>ITSELF.  IN LIGHT OF SOVIET SECURITY INTERESTS, IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ENVISION THE GDR BEING ABLE TO LEAVE THE </p><p>WARSAW PACT IN THE NEAR-TERM WITHOUT POSING A SERIOUS </p><p>THREAT TO SOVIET SECURITY AND OVERALL EUROPEAN </p><p>SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>18. THE SOVIETS CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT THE GERMAN </p><p>QUESTION CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED WITHIN AN ALL-EUROPEAN </p><p>CONTEXT.  IN FACT, VALENTIN FALIN, CHIEF OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT,  IS </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE TOLD WEST GERMAN OFFICIALS IN EARLY </p><p>OCTOBER (SEE BONN 32350) THAT THE USSR COULD ACCEPT </p><p>NEITHER GERMAN REUNIFICATION NOR THE GDR\'S LEAVING </p><p>THE WARSAW PACT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>POLAND: LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND HISTORY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>19. A GROUP OF AMERICAN SCHOLARS RECENTLY MET WITH </p><p>RAFAIL FEDOROV, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AIDE, TO DISCUSS </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN EASTERN EUROPE.  FEDOROV ADMITTED </p><p>THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD STRONG GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>INTERESTS IN POLAND, INSISTING, HOWEVER, THAT THEY </p><p>COINCIDED FULLY WITH POLISH NATIONAL INTERESTS.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT INTRUDE IN </p><p>POLISH AFFAIRS, BUT HIGHLIGHTED THE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>NETWORK OF ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>STATES, AS WELL AS THE OUTSTANDING "GERMAN </p><p>QUESTION."  IN FACT, FEDOROV POINTED OUT THAT SOVIET </p><p>MILITARY FORCES IN POLAND WERE PRINCIPALLY IN THE </p><p>WESTERN BORDER AREAS, LEAVING UNSAID THE FACT THAT </p><p>THESE WERE FORMER GERMAN LANDS (WHICH WOULD FALL </p><p>INSIDE THE 1937 BORDERS). </p><p> </p><p>20. SOVIET SCHOLARS, AS WELL AS FEDOROV, HAVE NOTED </p><p>THAT POLAND HAS BEEN THE TRADITIONAL PATH OF INVASION </p><p>TO THE SOVIET UNION AND NOW PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN </p><p>MILITARY LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO THE GDR.  THESE </p><p>FACTORS EVOKE CONSIDERABLE EMOTION ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>SOVIET MILITARY -- AND MANY CIVILIANS -- AND CAST </p><p>INTO DOUBT THE PROPOSITION THAT THE POLES WOULD BE </p><p>TOTALLY FREE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN LOT.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>KORTUNOV NOTED THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF </p><p>POLAND QUITTING THE ALLIANCE, WHICH BEARS THE NAME OF </p><p>ITS CAPITAL, COULD BE DEVASTATING.  IN FACT, WE WERE </p><p>TOLD BY A CONTACT IN THE MFA ARMS LIMITATION AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS WAS ONE FACTOR </p><p>THAT HAD LED THE SOVIETS TO CONSIDER PROPOSING WARSAW </p><p>AS THE POSSIBLE SEAT FOR A PERMANENT WARSAW PACT </p><p>HEADQUARTERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>COST OF STOPPING ANY DEFECTOR WOULD BE HIGH </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. SOVIET SCHOLARS DRAW A BLANK WHEN ASKED WHAT </p><p>COULD BE DONE TO STOP A POTENTIAL DEFECTOR.  THE </p><p>STANDARD METHOD UNDER "OLD THINKING" -- SENDING IN </p><p>THE TROOPS -- IS REGARDED AS PARTICULARLY OUT OF STEP </p><p>WITH THE TIMES.  YAKOVLEV HAS INSISTED PRIVATELY THAT </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT APPLY MILITARY FORCE IN </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE, REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>SHISHLIN, TOO, HAS SAID THAT THE USSR IS "OPPOSED TO </p><p>ANY USE OF TROOPS IN THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES\' </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  TO DO SO WOULD BE A TOTAL </p><p>REPUDIATION OF THE FOREIGN POLICY LINE THAT THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION HAS ESPOUSED FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>22. FURTHERMORE, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS WE HAVE SPOKEN </p><p>WITH BELIEVE THAT IF THE USSR WERE TO TAKE ANY </p><p>MILITARY ACTION AGAINST A DEPARTING WARSAW TREATY </p><p>MEMBER, IT WOULD RISK DESTROYING MOST OF ITS RECENT </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>WEST WOULD LIKELY COME TO A STANDSTILL -- PROGRESS IN </p><p>ARMS CONTROL AND EXPANDING ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE U.S. AND WESTERN EUROPE COULD VANISH. </p><p> </p><p>23. FINALLY, THE DOMESTIC RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH A </p><p>POLICY COULD BE UNPRECEDENTED.  THERE IS A CHANCE </p><p>THAT A MAJOR MILITARY INTERVENTION IN EASTERN EUROPE </p><p>COULD LEAD TO A CHANGE IN SOVIET LEADERSHIP AND THAT </p><p>THE REFORM MOVEMENT UNDERWAY HERE MIGHT COME TO A </p><p>RAPID HALT.  IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT A </p><p>MILITARY MOVE AGAINST REFORMERS ABROAD WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>A CONCOMITANT IMPACT ON REFORMERS AT HOME -- JUST AS </p><p>THE 1968 WTO INVASION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA CHILLED </p><p>REFORM THROUGHOUT EASTERN EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24. THE SOVIETS HAVE WOVEN FOR THEMSELVES A FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY PARADOX.  THEY APPEAR TO BE PERFECTLY PREPARED </p><p>TO LET THE EAST EUROPEAN STATES FOLLOW THEIR OWN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL PATHS TO SOCIALISM -- OR WHEREVER ELSE </p><p>THEY MAY BE HEADED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH "NEW POLITICAL </p><p>THINKING."  NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE THEIR BASIC </p><p>REJECTION OF POWER POLITICS, THEY BELIEVE THAT THESE </p><p>STATES WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS NEW FOUND FREEDOM </p><p>TO TAKE STEPS THAT COULD UNDERMINE SOVIET SECURITY </p><p>INTERESTS -- IN THIS CASE, LEAVING THE WARSAW PACT -- </p><p>BECAUSE THE SOVIETS BELIEVE TO DO SO WOULD NOT BE IN </p><p>SUCH A STATE\'S NATIONAL INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>25. IS THE BREZHNEV DOCTRINE THEREFORE A THING OF THE </p><p>PAST?  IN OUR VIEW THE ANSWER IS BOTH YES AND NO.  IN </p><p>THE SENSE THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD INTERVENE TO ENFORCE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY -- TO ENSURE THAT A CLIENT </p><p>STATE FOLLOWED THE SOVIET MODEL OR PATH TO SOCIALISM, </p><p>IT APPEARS THAT THE BREZHNEV DOCTRINE IS INDEED </p><p>DEAD.  IN A BROADER, GEO-POLITICAL SENSE, HOWEVER, A </p><p>MORE BASIC FORM OF THE DOCTRINE MAY REMAIN.  THE </p><p>SOVIETS CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY </p><p>CONCERNS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THESE </p><p>FACTORS CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED WHEN EVALUATING BASIC </p><p>SOVIET NATIONAL INTERESTS.  TO DATE, REFORM IN </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE HAS, REASSSURINGLY FOR THE SOVIETS, </p><p>PROCEEDED WITHOUT EITHER SUBSTANTIAL MANIFESTATIONS </p><p>OF ANTI-SOVIET FEELING OR DOMESTIC TURMOIL WHICH </p><p>THREATENED TO GET OUT OF CONTROL.  GORBACHEV\'S </p><p>PERSONAL POPULARITY AMONG EASTERN EUROPEANS SEEKING </p><p>REFORM HAS THUS FAR SERVED ESSENTIAL SOVIET SECURITY </p><p>INTERESTS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>26. THERE IS, NEVERTHELESS, A POINT AT WHICH THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION\'S LEADERSHIP COULD FEEL COMPELLED, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH IT WOULD DESTROY MUCH OF THE PROGRESS IT HAS </p><p>RECENTLY ACHIEVED, TO MOVE MILITARILY IN EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE.  AS DETAILED ABOVE, THE MOST LIKELY VENUES </p><p>FOR SUCH ACTION WOULD BE IN EITHER POLAND OR THE </p><p>GDR.  EVEN HERE, WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT GORBACHEV </p><p>WOULD USE EVERY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEVER HE COULD </p><p>TO PRECLUDE HAVING TO INITIATE SUCH AN ACTION. </p><p>THEREFORE, THE SPECTER OF SOVIET MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION, WHICH HAS HUNG OVER EASTERN EUROPE FOR </p><p>THE PAST FORTY YEARS, THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY </p><p>DISPELLED, HAS FADED APPRECIABLY. </p><p> </p><p>27. LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p></p></div>
