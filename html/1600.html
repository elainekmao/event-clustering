IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE SUMMONED COMMONWEALTH AND SADC HEADS </p><p>OF MISSION IN HARARE ON MARCH 21 TO DELIVER A TWO-HOUR </p><p>HARANGUE ON THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTERIAL ACTION GROUP </p><p>(CMAG) STATEMENT ISSUED THE DAY BEFORE IN LONDON. </p><p>"NOTHING WHICH HAS HAPPENED IN ZIMBABWE CONSTITUTES A </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE HARARE DECLARATION," THE MINISTER SAID </p><p>IN A STATEMENT RELEASED FOLLOWING THE MEETING.  CANADIAN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER JAMES WALL TOLD CHARGE THAT MUDENGE </p><p>INSISTED THAT ONLY "PERSISTENT, CONSISTENT VIOLATIONS OF </p><p>THE HARARE DECLARATION" WARRANTED CONSIDERATION BY THE </p><p>CMAG, THUS ITS DISCUSSION OF ZIMBABWE UNDER "ANY OTHER </p><p>BUSINESS" AND DECISION TO SEND A DELEGATION TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>WAS NOT ONLY IRREGULAR BUT ALSO ILLEGAL.  HE RULED OUT </p><p>ANY CMAG MISSION.  ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH DEPUTY HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER IN HARARE, IAN HAY-CAMPBELL, THE CMAG\'S </p><p>DECISION TO ISSUE THE STATEMENT AND SEND THE TEAM WAS </p><p>GALVANIZED BY MUDENGE TELEPHONING COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL MCKINNON DURING THE DISCUSSION AND ISSUING </p><p>THREATS IN INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE, THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>REPORTED TO THE CMAG MEMBERS.  ANY FENCE-SITTERS WERE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY CONVINCED OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATION FOR A MISSION AND STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDINQ TO THE CANADIAN HIQH COMMISSIONER, </p><p>MUDENGE GENERALIZED THAT ANY CONCERN IN ZIMBABWE BOILED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01082  01 OF 02  211531Z </p><p>DOWN TO LAND.  THE FOREIQN MINISTER SAID HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD NOT MOVED AS FAST AS IT SHOULD HAVE TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>LAND QUESTION IN THE 1980S AND BY 1997 WAS DESPERATE. </p><p>IT WAS GLAD FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION OFFER TO HOST A </p><p>DONORS\' CONFERENCE.  HE WAVED AWAY THE UTILITY OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE SINCE THE DONORS HAD DONE "NOTHING," AND IN </p><p>ANY CASE, THE PROBLEM WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BRITAIN\'S </p><p>STRING OF BROKEN PROMISES.  HE TOLD THE GATHERED HEADS </p><p>OF MISSION THAT "INTERNATIONAL CONCERN WAS MISPLACED," </p><p>SINCE THE CURRENT DISPUTE WAS A BILATERAL ONE BETWEEN </p><p>THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ZIMBABWE.  "DON\'T GANG UP ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE," HE PLEADED, "FOR GOD\'S SAKE DON\'T TAKE </p><p>SIDES."  HE ALSO WARNED THEM NOT TO INTERFERE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN DOMESTIC POLITICS (COMMENT: PRESUMABLY A </p><p>REFERENCE TO EXTERNAL SUPPORT OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE.  END COMMENT).  OTHERWISE, THE </p><p>PEOPLE "WILL ACT VERY STRONQLY." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURINQ THE QUESTION AND ANSWER TIME THE MINISTER </p><p>REDUCED THE PROBLEMS WITH THE JUDICIARY TO A MISHANDLING </p><p>OF CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY\'S RESIGNATION.  HE CALLED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CRITICISM OF THE JUDICIARY "A HEALTHY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC EXERCISE," CITING FREQUENT CRITICISM OF </p><p>JUDICIAL RULINQS AND IMPEACHMENT OF JUDGES BY </p><p>LEGISLATURES IN THE U.S.  HE ALSO CAST ASPERSIONS </p><p>PERSONALLY ON GUBBAY, WHO COMPARED UNFAVORABLY WITH </p><p>PREVIOUS CHIEF JUSTICES WHO WERE MUCH BETTER AT HANDLING </p><p>CRITICISM.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SUPREME COURT\'S </p><p>RULINGS ON LAND WERE CORRECT LEGALLY, BUT NOT MORALLY. </p><p>HE POOH-POOHED CRITICISMS OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S APPROACH </p><p>TOWARD THE MEDIA, SAYING ZIMBABWE HAS "EXTREME PRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01082  01 OF 02  211531Z </p><p>FREEDOM," AND REMARKED (ERRONEOUSLY) THAT TWO FOREIGN </p><p>JOURNALISTS HAD RECENTLY BEEN EXPELLED BECAUSE THEIR </p><p>WORK PERMITS HAD EXPIRED.  REGARDING THE BOMBING OF THE </p><p>"DAILY NEWS" THE MINISTER SAID, "SO WHAT?" AND NOTED </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" </p><p>OFFERED TO PRINT THE PAPER THE FOLLOWING DAY.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT LAND REFORM WAS IRREVERSIBLE AND </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS WAS COMPLETELY </p><p>FLAWED.  HE WENT ON TO DRAW AN ANALOGY ABOUT PLANE CRASH </p><p>VICTIMS EATINQ HUMAN FLESH TO SURVIVE IN AN UNFORTUNATE </p><p>ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DRIVEN </p><p>TO EXTREME MEASURES TO SATISFY THE PEOPLE\'S HUNGER FOR </p><p>LAND.  HE ENDED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT "WE [IN THE </p><p>ZANU-PF- LED GOVERNMENT] ARE REVOLUTIONARIES" WHO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT "WHAT WE ARE DOINQ IS RIQHT" AND WOULD </p><p>RATHER BE DEFEATED THAN BACK DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: FROM OUR COLLEAGUE\'S ACCOUNT OF THE </p><p>MEETING, CAPTURED BY ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION </p><p>NEWS CAMERAS, WE GATHER THAT IT WAS ANOTHER VINTAGE </p><p>MUDENGE PERFORMANCE.

EXTERNAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON ZIMBABWE IS REACHING A CRESCENDO AND EVEN </p><p>ITS TRADITIONAL FRIENDS NO LONQER LOUDLY DEFEND IT. </p><p>MUDENGE\'S RESPONSE: TO CALL FOR DIALOQUE WITH THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH AND IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT </p><p>TO TAKE PLACE.  ALTHOUGH IN NORMAL COUNTRIES SUCH INEPT </p><p>HANDLING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD COST A FOREIQN </p><p>MINISTER HIS JOB, IN THIS CASE WE PREDICT THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO USE DEFIANT LANGUAGE, PORTRAYING ITSELF </p><p>AS A VICTIM OF A BRITISH-LED CONSPIRACY AIMED AT </p><p>TOPPLING THE MUGABE REGIME.  IF THE GOZ CONTINUES TO </p><p>REJECT ATTEMPTS BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENGAGE </p><p>IT IN CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE, WE ARE NOT SURE THAT IT HAS </p><p>ANY OPTIONS LEFT FOR EXTRICATING ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT </p><p>PREDICAMENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
