<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001042 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EAGR, ASEC, ZI, ZA </p><p>SUBJECT: ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT MAKES STATE VISIT TO ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa made a state visit </p><p>to Zimbabwe April 25-28 as the guest of honor at Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>International Trade Fair, an occasion he used in an apparent </p><p>attempt to bolster President Mugabe\'s image at home and </p><p>abroad.  The first head of state to visit Zimbabwe since the </p><p>flawed presidential election of March 9-11, Mwanawasa took </p><p>the opportunity to wax eloquent about Zambian-Zimbabwean </p><p>relations and the bright future of regional trade in southern </p><p>Africa.  During a tour of a Masvingo maize-growing project on </p><p>April 25 (see paragraph 2), the Zambian President </p><p>congratulated Zimbabweans\' on their "choice" of Mugabe as </p><p>president.  Mwanawasa proclaimed the election free and fair, </p><p>noted that peace and harmony had been restored, and urged </p><p>Zimbabweans to bury their political differences -- as </p><p>Zambians had done after their election -- to address the </p><p>problem of growing hunger and economic decline.  In an April </p><p>26 press statement, the opposition Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC) criticized Mwanawasa for endorsing Mugabe\'s win </p><p>and expressed "shock" and "dismay" that Mwanawasa was under </p><p>the impression that peace and harmony had returned to </p><p>Zimbabwe when MDC members continue to die at the hands of </p><p>ruling party supporters. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mwanawasa visited the Masvingo lowveldt, where the </p><p>large, irrigated sugar cane plantations are located, to view </p><p>the Agriculture Ministry\'s most recent cock-eyed scheme to </p><p>alleviate food shortages.  This scheme has the GOZ </p><p>"borrowing" acreage from Anglo-American\'s Triangle Sugar </p><p>Estate and the Hippo Valley estate next door to plant a crop </p><p>of "winter maize".  The effort, we are told, ignores basic </p><p>tenets of agriculture.  For example, winter frost is </p><p>prevalent in the area, which kills early maize but does not </p><p>affect the hardier sugar cane.  In addition, sugar cane </p><p>fields harbor an insect called the black maize beetle, which </p><p>only consumes very young sugar cane when it is controlled. </p><p>The bug will have a feast on the unexpected maize and </p><p>drastically reduce yields, perhaps even to zero.  Maize needs </p><p>fairly high soil moisture content to germinate.  Cane fields </p><p>are sandy (cane is deep-rooted and the irrigation water soaks </p><p>through the sandy upper level to be trapped by the heavier </p><p>soil below, thereby reducing water usage rates), and such </p><p>soils usually do not retain moisture well enough for good </p><p>germination to occur.  If one irrigates too much, the seeds </p><p>rot; too little, and no baby corn plants.  Agronomists and </p><p>others in agriculture deride the effort, labeling it as a </p><p>waste of precious resources and ill-fated from the start. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On April 26, Mwanawasa officially opened the 43rd </p><p>annual Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in Bulawayo. </p><p>Despite announcements from Mwanawasa and Mugabe that improved </p><p>cross-border trade is just around the corner, the Trade Fair </p><p>opened with the lowest level of exhibitor participation since </p><p>independence in 1980.  (Note: The U.S. did not display and </p><p>have an official information booth at the fair for the first </p><p>time in 21 years.  End note.)  Zimbabwe\'s regressive economic </p><p>policies undoubtedly scared away most Western participants, </p><p>leaving primarily local and regional companies to proffer </p><p>their limited wares.  Mwanawasa tried to make the most of </p><p>things by describing small- to medium-sized businesses as the </p><p>hope for Zimbabwe\'s economic development. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: Mwanawasa, as the junior leader in the SADC </p><p>region, was probably delighted to be invited by Mugabe, the </p><p>most senior.  We certainly would not have expected Mwanawasa </p><p>to be anything other than gracious and supportive in his </p><p>visit, as he angles for acceptance in the local presidential </p><p>"club," but his wholesale endorsement of Mugabe, and by </p><p>extension the disaster engulfing Zimbabwe, went several steps </p><p>too far.  Mugabe, for his part, took advantage of the Zambian </p><p>leader\'s junior status -- by stage-managing a state visit so </p><p>soon after the election -- to help underscore for Zimbabweans </p><p>and other regional leaders his claim to be the legitimate </p><p>president of Zimbabwe.  Mugabe undoubtedly took comfort in </p><p>the fact that a foreign leader was willing to visit Zimbabwe </p><p>to open the trade fair, a long-standing tradition.  We </p><p>understand that several other heads of state were "otherwise </p><p>occupied" and did not respond to earlier Mugabe feelers.  It </p><p>will be interesting to observe whether the other regional, </p><p>wizened leaders will be willing to accept Mugabe\'s outreach </p><p>as his badly tainted election recedes into the past.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
