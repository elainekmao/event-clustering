Under headline "SADC commended for seeing light at </p><p>      last" the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>      October 8 editorial to welcoming the decision by the </p><p>      Southern African Development Community (SADC) to block </p><p>      Robert Mugabe from SADC chairmanship.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The bigger political picture, ignoring the </p><p>      arguments about whether Zimbabwe withdrew its claim </p><p>      to the deputy chairmanship voluntarily, or was </p><p>      kicked out on its ear, is that SADC has at last seen </p><p>      the light.  Most people in Zimbabwe had given up on </p><p>      SADC as an effective and active player in the </p><p>      democratization stakes in the region. . .  This </p><p>      latest decision by the group, whatever Mugabe\'s spin </p><p>      doctors say of its origins, is to be commended. </p><p>      SADC has at last seen the light." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
