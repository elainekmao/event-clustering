(SBU) THE BANK OF ITALY (BOI), LONG A CORNERSTONE OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN ECONOMY, FACES CHANGED RESPONSIBILITIES AND </p><p>ROLES.  WITH THE ADVENT OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, </p><p>THE BOI IS ONE OF THIRTEEN NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS WITH </p><p>A VOICE IN THE SINGLE ECB MONETARY POLICY.   THE ECB IS </p><p>ORGANIZED WITH "CENTRALIZED DECISION-MAKING, </p><p>DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS."  ACTING UNDER ECB DIRECTION, </p><p>THE BOI RETAINS AN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL ROLE IN </p><p>PRINTING CURRENCY AND MINTING COINS, MANAGING FOREIGN </p><p>RESERVES, CONDUCTING PAYMENT OPERATIONS, MANAGING </p><p>REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  THE BOI REMAINS INDEPENDENT IN </p><p>TWO KEY AREAS:  BANK SUPERVISION AND ECONOMIC STUDIES. </p><p>THE BOI CONTINUES TO HAVE AN AUTHORITATIVE, INDEPENDENT </p><p>VOICE IN ITALIAN ECONOMIC POLICY.  THIS CABLE EXAMINES </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE BANK OF ITALY, IN PARTICULAR, AND, MORE </p><p>GENERALLY, THE ROLE OF NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS OF THE </p><p>ECB.  WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ECB MAY BE ONLY AS STRONG AS </p><p>ITS KEY NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE BANK OF ITALY </p><p>----------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03652  01 OF 05  240942Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ITALY\'S CENTRAL BANK, THE BANK OF ITALY (BOI), </p><p>IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY\'S MOST HIGHLY RESPECTED ENTITIES. </p><p>FOUNDED IN 1893, THE BANK HAS ENJOYED A POWERFUL, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL POSITION IN ITALIAN ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS </p><p>LIFE.  THE BOI IS LARGELY AUTONOMOUS.  ITS GOVERNOR IS </p><p>TRADITIONALLY A TECHNOCRAT, RATHER THAN A POLITICIAN, </p><p>ALTHOUGH APPOINTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND APPROVED </p><p>BY THE PARLIAMENT.  ITALIAN PRESIDENT CARLO CIAMPI WAS </p><p>THE PREVIOUS CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR.  THE BOI IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO, AND REGULARLY DOES, VOICE INDEPENDENT AND </p><p>OFTEN QUITE CRITICAL OPINIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U).  BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THE ECB, THE BOI HAD A </p><p>STAFF OF OVER 9,400 EMPLOYEES. GOVERNOR ANTONIO FAZIO, </p><p>A WELL-RESPECTED ECONOMIST, WAS APPOINTED IN 1993, AND </p><p>IS FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BANK.  HIS </p><p>DEPUTY, VINCENZO DESARIO, ALSO STARTED HIS CAREER IN </p><p>THE BANK AND IS EXPERT OF BANKING SUPERVISION.   THE </p><p>BOI HAD 11 DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING BANK SUPERVISION, </p><p>ECONOMIC RESEARCH, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, NOTE ISSUE, </p><p>CENTRAL BANKING AND MARKETS, PAYMENT SYSTEM AND </p><p>TREASURY OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ROLE OF THE NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS (NCBS) </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) WHEN THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) WAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN 1998, NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS (NCBS) </p><p>FOUND THEMSELVES STRIPPED OF MANY OF THEIR POWERS.  THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03652  01 OF 05  240942Z </p><p>ECB WAS GIVEN AUTHORITY OVER MONETARY POLICY FOR MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  AS SUCH, THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL </p><p>BANK HAS DRAMATICALLY ALTERED THE STRUCTURE AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOI.  WHILE THE BOI RETAINS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR BANK SUPERVISION AND FOR INDEPENDENT </p><p>ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, IT NO LONGER HAS AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>MONETARY POLICYMAKING ROLE.  INSTEAD, THE BOI AND THE </p><p>OTHER MEMBER STATE NCBS TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE TO EURO- </p><p>ZONE MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS AND ECONOMIC STABILITY </p><p>AND GROWTH.  WHILE THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK SETS MONETARY POLICY, NCBS </p><p>IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY.  WHILE THE ECB\'S COUNCIL FIXES </p><p>CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVES </p><p>AND SETS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY (ALONG GUIDELINES </p><p>APPROVED BY FINANCE MINISTERS) ,  THE NCBS HOLD AND </p><p>INVEST A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE RESERVES AND THE </p><p>LARGER NCB\'S CONDUCT FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) THE ECB HOLDS EURO 46.8 BILLION OF THE </p><p>EUROSYSTEM\'S EURO 386.7 BILLION IN OFFICIAL RESERVE </p><p>ASSETS.  THE REST ARE HELD BY NCBS IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>ECB GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>RESERVES HAS BEEN SET BY THE GOVERNING COUNCIL AND </p><p>INCLUDES GOLD, JAPANESE YEN AND U.S. DOLLARS.  NCBS </p><p>MANAGE THEIR OWN FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVES AS THEY SEE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6481 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03652  02 OF 05  240942Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  FMP-00   EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------CF8165  240942Z /38 </p><p>R 240939Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5067 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2758 </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 05 ROME 003652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>STATE PASS CEA </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, JONES </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03652  02 OF 05  240942Z </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ECON, IT, </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ECB, NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS AND THE BANK </p><p>OF ITALY </p><p> </p><p>FIT.  THEIR OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVES, </p><p>ABOVE CERTAIN LIMITS, ARE SUBJECT TO ECB NOTIFICATION </p><p>OR APPROVAL, IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE </p><p>MONETARY POLICY OF THE ECB. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) NCBS ALSO CONDUCT PAYMENT OPERATIONS.  TO ENSURE </p><p>THE SMOOTH OPERATION OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS, THE TARGET OR </p><p>TRANS-EUROPEAN AUTOMATED REAL-TIME GROSS SETTLEMENTS </p><p>EXPRESS TRANSFER SYSTEM IS USED.  THIS IS A </p><p>DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM, CONSISTING OF 15 NATIONAL REAL </p><p>TIMES GROSS SETTLEMENT (RTGS) SYSTEMS AND THE ECB </p><p>PAYMENT MECHANISM (EPM).  THESE ARE INTERLINKED TO </p><p>PROVIDE A UNIFORM PLATFORM FOR PROCESSING CROSS BORDER </p><p>PAYMENTS IN EURO. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) CARLO MARTENS, DEPUTY HEAD OF THE PAYMENT </p><p>SYSTEMS POLICY DIVISION OF THE ECB, NOTED THAT TARGET </p><p>EVENTUALLY MIGHT BE CENTRALIZED.  THIS MAY BE </p><p>PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE WHEN THE EU IS ENLARGED AND </p><p>SEVERAL NEW MEMBERS JOIN THE ECB SYSTEM.  MARTENS </p><p>ENVISIONS AN INCREASINGLY STRONG ECB WITHIN AN ENLARGED </p><p>EU.  ACCORDING TO MARTENS, NCBS HAVE CONCEDED THIS </p><p>UNOFFICIALLY ALREADY, BUT HAVE NOT FIXED A TIME FRAME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03652  02 OF 05  240942Z </p><p>FOR REFORM. (NOTE: SOME NCBS ARE CONCERNED THAT TOO </p><p>MANY FUNCTIONS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE ECB AND </p><p>THAT IT MAY BECOME TOO POWERFUL.  GOVERNORS AND STAFF </p><p>FROM THE BUNDESBANK, THE BANK OF IRELAND AND THE BANK </p><p>OF FRANCE HAVE VOICED THIS CONCERN.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE BANK OF ITALY, LIKE OTHER EUROSYSTEM NCBS, </p><p>ISSUES EURO BANKNOTES  ACCORDING THE PROCEDURES SET BY </p><p>THE ECB GOVERNING COUNCIL.  ECB OFFICERS TOLD US THAT, </p><p>FOR THE EURO CHANGEOVER ON JANUARY 1, 2002, THE NCBS </p><p>WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING EURO BANKNOTES TO MEET </p><p>THEIR NATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, AS SET BY THE ECB.  NCBS </p><p>HAD PRINTED ALL THE FORMATS OF EURO BANKNOTES FROM 5 TO </p><p>500 EUROS (92 PERCENT OF THOSE PRINTED).  THE REMAINDER </p><p>WAS ISSUED BY THE ECB.  THE TWELVE NCBS WILL CIRCULATE </p><p>ALL EURO BANKNOTES, INCLUDING THOSE ISSUED BY OTHER </p><p>NCBS AND BY THE ECB. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) NCBS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ECB ON REPURCHASE </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  THE NCBS COLLECT BIDS AND SEND THEM TO </p><p>ECB.  THE ECB MAKES A SINGLE RANKING OF ALL BIDS AND </p><p>DECIDES ON THE QUANTITY TO ALLOCATE AND THE INTEREST </p><p>RATE.  THIS DECISION IS THEN COMMUNICATED TO THE NBCS </p><p>FOR COMMUNICATION TO THOSE BANKS THAT PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>THE TENDER. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) THE BANK OF ITALY IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT IS THE </p><p>ONLY NCB (AMONG ECB MEMBERS) THAT ACTS AS THE NATIONAL </p><p>TREASURY.  THE BOI COLLECTS PENDING PROCEEDS, EXECUTIVE </p><p>PAYMENT ORDERS ISSUED BY CENTRAL AND LOCAL PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS BASED ON BUDGET AND OFF-BUDGET </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03652  02 OF 05  240942Z </p><p>PROCEEDINGS; RECEIVES, HOLDS AND RETURNS BOND AND CASH </p><p>DEPOSITS; CARRIES OUT OPERATIONS OF PLACING AND </p><p>REIMBURSING STATE BONDS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) THE ECB HAS VIRTUALLY NO DIRECT ROLE IN BANK </p><p>SUPERVISION BUT IS A MEMBER OF AND IS THE SECRETARIAT </p><p>FOR THE BANKING SUPERVISION COMMITTEE.  IN MANY MEMBER </p><p>STATES, INCLUDING ITALY, NCBS RETAIN THIS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  THE BANK OF ITALY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE SUPERVISION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF BANKS AND NON- </p><p>BANKING INTERMEDIARIES, PROMOTION AND CONTROL OF </p><p>COMPETITION IN THE BANKING SECTOR, MARKET SUPERVISION </p><p>AND THE SUPERVISION OF THE DIRECT OFFER OF PAYMENT </p><p>SERVICES.  THE BOI ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRUDENTIAL </p><p>SUPERVISION, WHICH INCLUDES FIVE CATEGORIES: </p><p>SUPERVISION OF BANKS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM, THE CREDIT </p><p>MARKET, FINANCIAL MARKET INTERMEDIARIES, THE PAYMENT </p><p>SYSTEM AND WHOLESALE MARKETS FOR GOVERNMENT SECURITIES </p><p>AND TRADING OF INTER-BANK FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) A PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT THE </p><p>SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BANK OF ITALY.

THE COMMISSION\'S CHAIRMAN, </p><p>GIORGIO LA MALFA, HAS STATED THAT "THE PROGRESSIVE </p><p>INTEGRATION OF EUROPEAN MARKETS WITHIN THE CENTRAL BANK </p><p>RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER BANK OVERSIGHT SHOULD </p><p>TAKE PLACE AT A NATIONAL LEVEL OR BE LODGED WITHIN THE </p><p>ECB."  (WHEN RELEASED, THE COMMISSION\'S FINDINGS WILL </p><p>BE REPORTED SEPTEL.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) THIS POSITION CONTRASTS WITH RECENT STATEMENTS </p><p>FROM THE ECB ITSELF.  THE GOVERNING COUNCIL STATED </p><p>FIRMLY IN MARCH 2001 THAT "THERE ARE VALID REASONS </p><p>ARGUING IN FAVOR OF MAINTAINING A STRONG INVOLVEMENT OF </p><p>CENTRAL BANKS IN PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION." THE ECB\'S </p><p>BANK SUPERVISION COMMITTEE PROVIDES ADVISORY SUPPORT TO </p><p>NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN DRAFTING BANK SUPERVISION </p><p>LEGISLATION.  JUKKE VESALA, THE ECB\'S SENIOR EXPERT ON </p><p>PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION, TOLD US THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN </p><p>REVIEW ANY PROJECT OF REFORM OF NATIONAL BANK </p><p>SUPERVISION LEGISLATION AT AN EARLY STAGE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  NCBS STILL CONDUCT THE TRADITIONAL CENTRAL </p><p>BANK FUNCTIONS OF STATISTICAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RESEARCH.  THE BANK OF ITALY\'S RESEARCH AND STATISTICAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03652  03 OF 05  240942Z </p><p>SERVICE IS ESSENTIAL, AS IT PROVIDES AN AUTHORITATIVE, </p><p>YET INDEPENDENT, TOP-LEVEL ADVISORY SERVICE FOR THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL BODIES (GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT) IN </p><p>THE FIELD OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND BUDGET AND FINANCIAL </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL STATUS OF THE BOI AND NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) THE BANK OF ITALY, LIKE EACH OF THE NCBS, IS A </p><p>SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY ACCORDING TO ITALIAN LAW.  A </p><p>LEGISLATIVE DECREE OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT STATES: </p><p>"THE BANK OF ITALY, THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>REPUBLIC, IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ESCB.  IT SHALL </p><p>PERFORM THE TASKS AND FUNCTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO IT IN </p><p>THAT CAPACITY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE OF THE </p><p>ESCB.  IT SHALL PURSUE THE OBJECTIVES ASSIGNED TO THE </p><p>ESCB IN CONFORMITY WITH ARTICLE 105 OF THE TREATY AND </p><p>ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES AND THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS OF THE ECB". </p><p> </p><p>16.

ONLY IN </p><p>A CASE OF EQUALLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES MIGHT </p><p>NATIONALITY BECOME A CRITERION, TO COMPENSATE UNDER- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03652  04 OF 05  240943Z </p><p>REPRESENTED MEMBER STATES. ACCORDING TO OTHER SOURCES, </p><p>ECB MANAGEMENT IS SENSITIVE TO AVOIDING A BLOATED </p><p>BUREAUCRACY, AND IS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP PERSONNEL </p><p>NUMBERS DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) AS ECB RANKS HAVE GROWN, EMPLOYMENT AT NCBS </p><p>HAVE FALLEN.  THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE BOI DECLINED </p><p>FROM MID-1998 TO MID-2001 BY ABOUT 400 POSITIONS.  AT </p><p>ITS PEAK IN 1995, THE BOI EMPLOYED 9,423 PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>BOI IS PLANNING TO REDUCE EMPLOYMENT BY ANOTHER 20 </p><p>PERCENT, AROUND 1,500 POSITIONS, PRIMARILY THROUGH </p><p>ATTRITION.  THE REMAINING BOI STAFF WILL, THUS, NUMBER </p><p>AROUND 7,500 PEOPLE.  AMONG NCBS, EMPLOYMENT RANGES </p><p>FROM THE 16,800 PEOPLE EMPLOYED BY THE BANK OF FRANCE, </p><p>AND 15,900 EMPLOYED BY THE BUNDESBANK, TO THE 172 </p><p>EMPLOYEES OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF LUXEMBOURG.  ECB </p><p>SOURCES TELL US THAT THE BANK OF FRANCE HAS CUT AROUND </p><p>1,500 POSITIONS, BUT THAT OTHERS -- GERMANY AND </p><p>PORTUGAL, FOR EXAMPLE -- HAVE KEPT NUMBERS RELATIVELY </p><p>STABLE, ALTHOUGH THE GERMAN BUNDESBANK RECENTLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED STAFF REDUCTIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS </p><p>REORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>NCB CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECB CAPITAL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) THE ECB HAS A TOTAL CAPITAL OF FOUR BILLION </p><p>EURO, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO FIVE BILLION </p><p>EURO OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF </p><p>ECB CAPITAL IS TO ACT AS A RESERVE FUND, PROVIDING THE </p><p>BANK WITH SUFFICIENT INCOME WHILE MAINTAINING AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03652  04 OF 05  240943Z </p><p>APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL SECURITY.  IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH ARTICLE 29 OF THE STATUTES OF THE ESCB AND THE </p><p>ECB, EACH NCB CONTRIBUTES TO THE ECB\'S CAPITAL </p><p>ACCORDING TO A WEIGHTING SCHEME.  THIS SCHEME IS BASED </p><p>ON EACH MEMBER STATE\'S SHARE OF EU POPULATION AND </p><p>NOMINAL EU GDP.  THE ASSIGNED WEIGHTS ARE TO BE </p><p>ADJUSTED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND UPON ACCESSION OF ANY NEW </p><p>EU MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE ECB IS AUTHORIZED </p><p>TO INCREASE THE CAPITAL UP TO A FURTHER E5BN.  ON THE </p><p>BASIS OF ALL FIFTEEN EU MEMBER STATES, THE BUNDESBANK, </p><p>BANK OF FRANCE AND BANK OF ITALY ARE THE THREE LARGEST </p><p>CONTRIBUTORS OF ECB\'S CAPITAL.  HOWEVER, ONLY TWELVE </p><p>COUNTRIES CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE EUROSYSTEM, AND </p><p>ONLY THESE COUNTRIES HAVE FULLY PAID THEIR </p><p>CORRESPONDING CAPITAL SHARES (81 PERCENT OF FIVE </p><p>BILLION EURO).  THUS, THE GERMAN SHARE IS 30 PERCENT, </p><p>THE FRENCH SHARE IS 20.8 PERCENT AND THE ITALIAN SHARE </p><p>IS 18.4 PERCENT.  THESE THREE MAKE UP 69.2 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE ECB\'S AGREED FIVE BILLION EURO CAPITAL.  THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANKS OF DENMARK, SWEDEN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM </p><p>HAVE AGREED TO PAY THE REMAINING NINETEEN PERCENT (950 </p><p>MILLION EURO) BUT HAVE TO DATE PAID ONLY FIVE PERCENT. </p><p>ECB SOURCES TELL US THAT THIS FIVE PERCENT IS DESIGNED </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6484 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03652  05 OF 05  240943Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  FMP-00   EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------CF8182  240943Z /38 </p><p>R 240939Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5070 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2761 </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 05 OF 05 ROME 003652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>STATE PASS CEA </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, JONES </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03652  05 OF 05  240943Z </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ECON, IT, </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ECB, NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS AND THE BANK </p><p>OF ITALY </p><p> </p><p>TO PRODUCE AN INCOME COVERING COSTS RELATED TO THE </p><p>THREE NCBS OUTSIDE THE EUROSYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) DESPITE THE STRENGTH OF THE ECB, THE </p><p>EUROSYSTEM IS STILL BASED ON THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>"CENTRALIZED DECISION-MAKING, DECENTRALIZED </p><p>OPERATIONS".  NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>BANK OF ITALY, CONTINUE TO PLAY A KEY ROLE.  AS THE </p><p>EUROSYSTEM EXPANDS THROUGH EU ENLARGEMENT, THE </p><p>INEFFICIENCIES AND COSTS OF DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS </p><p>ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE.  THIS WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR </p><p>THE EUROSYSTEM.  THE LARGEST AND MORE EFFICIENT -- SUCH </p><p>AS THE BANK OF ITALY -- ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD THE SYSTEM </p><p>TOGETHER.  THE EUROSYSTEM MAY ONLY BE AS STRONG AS </p><p>THESE KEY NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS. </p><p> </p><p>25.
