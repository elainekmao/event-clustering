<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 04589 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQ STRESSES NORMALCY WHILE WARNING IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  WHILE STILL CELEBRATING ITS "VICTORY" </p><p>IN THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, IRAQ APPEARS BENT ON RETURNING </p><p>TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  EMPHASIS IS LAID </p><p>ON BASRA\'S RESURRECTION AND THE RE-OPENING OF THE PORT </p><p>OF UMM QASR.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ DENIED THAT IRAN HAD </p><p>SEARCHED AN IRAQI SHIP AND WARNED THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO </p><p>DO SO WOULD BRING REPERCUSSIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IRAQIS CELEBRATED THE OFFICIAL CEASEFIRE WITH AS </p><p>MUCH ENTHUSIASM AS THEY DID THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE </p><p>CEASEFIRE ON AUGUST 8, BUT WITHOUT THE WIDESPREAD </p><p>DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS WHICH MARKED THE EARLIER CELE- </p><p>BRATIONS.  JUBILANT CROWDS SURGED THROUGH THE STREETS </p><p>DURING THE EVENING HOURS OF AUGUST 19-21.  PRESIDENT </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN ATTENDED A HUGE GOVERNMENT RALLY AT </p><p>GREAT FESTIVITIES SQUARE IN BAGHDAD AUGUST 20; </p><p>UNUSUALLY FOR HIM, HE PERMITTED A THRONG OF </p><p>THOUSANDS TO CONVERGE ON HIM.  ON THE SPUR OF THE </p><p>MOMENT, HE DECLARED AUGUST 21 A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. </p><p>THE MEDIA REPORTED THAT "TENS OF THOUSANDS" OF </p><p>PILGRIMS RENEWED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SADDAM ON VISITS </p><p>DURING THE SHI\'A HOLY DAY OF ASHURA (AUGUST 22) TO </p><p>THE "SHRINE OF SADDAM\'S GREAT ANCESTOR" THE IMAM </p><p>HUSAYN,. IN THE SHI\'A HOLY CITY OF KARBALA.  (ONE </p><p>SHI\'A PILGRIM TO KARBALA TELLS US, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>REVERENCE TO SADDAM HAD NO PART AT ALL IN THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>ASHURA CELEBRATION.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS THE CELEBRATIONS CONTINUED, THE IRAQIS OPENED </p><p>THE AIRPORT AT BASRA TO CIVILIAN AIR TRAFFIC </p><p>AUGUST 20, AND RE-OPENED THE PORTS OF UMM QASR </p><p>AND KHOR AL-ZUBAIR TO MERCHANT SHIPPING.  REPORTS </p><p>IN BAGHDAD CLAIM BASRA HAS BEEN GIVEN FIRST CALL ON </p><p>WHATEVER IS NEEDED TO RETURN THE TOWN TO ITS PREWAR </p><p>CONDITION AND ITS STATUS AS IRAQ\'S SECOND LARGEST </p><p>CITY.  MOST OF BASRA\'S POPULATION, HALF OF WHICH </p><p>FLED THE CITY DURING THE WAR, HAS NOW RETURNED. </p><p>NOW, PAINT AND BUILDING MATERIALS ARE REPORTEDLY </p><p>BEING DIVERTED THERE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SHORTAGES </p><p>ARE FEARED ELSEWHERE IN IRAQ.  GULF AIR, OWNED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENTS OF BAHRAIN, QATAR, OMAN, AND ABU </p><p>DHABI, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RESUME SERVICE TO </p><p>BAGHDAD AND TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IRAQ\'S NAVAL COMMANDER DENIED THAT IRAN HAD </p><p>SEARCHED AN IRAQI MERCHANT VESSEL IN THE GULF </p><p>AUGUST 20, AND CLAIMED THAT IRANIANS HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>ALLOWED TO BOARD THE IRAQI SHIP.  THE IRANIANS SENT </p><p>A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP TO HOVER ABOVE THE VESSEL WHILE </p><p>AN IRANIAN NAVAL SHIP SHADOWED IT, HE SAID.  THE </p><p>COMMANDER DECLARED THAT IRAQ WAS DETERMINED TO </p><p>EXERCISE FULLY ITS RIGHTS TO FREE NAVIGATION IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL WATERS, AND WOULD COUNTER ANY IRANIAN </p><p>MOVE WHICH INTERFERED WITH THESE RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
