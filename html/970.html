<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 015505 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMMER, PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, P, E </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  11/23/03 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SADC, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA\'S LONG-TERM SADC APPROACH </p><p> </p><p>REF:   STATE  136499 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS REED FENDRICK. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  IN A NOVEMBER 23 MEETING WITH DFA DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS HORST BRAMMER, AND DFA DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION COEN BEZUIDENHOUT, THE SAG </p><p>OFFICIALS TOLD POLMIL OFFICER AND POLOFFICER THAT, WHILE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA SUPPORTED THE STRENGTHENING OF SADC AS AN INSTITUTION, IT </p><p>HAD ADOPTED A LONG-TERM APPROACH TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S REFORM. </p><p>ACCORDING TO BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT, THE RESTRUCTURING OF SADC\'S </p><p>SECTORS HAD BEEN POSTPONED, AS HAD THE RESOLUTION OF THE SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN THE CHAIR AND THE ORGAN ON POLITICS, SECURITY, AND DEFENSE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE HOPEFUL THAT SADC AS A WHOLE WOULD GROW STRONGER </p><p>WITH TIME, THEY NOTED THAT CURRENT EVENTS, SUCH AS THE DROC </p><p>CONFLICT AND LESOTHO, COUPLED WITH A RELUCTANCE OF MEMBER STATES TO </p><p>COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A SADC OVERHAUL, HAVE PUT REFORM ON THE </p><p>BACKBURNER UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER THE CHAIRMANSHIP TURNOVER IN 1999, </p><p>FOR WHICH SOUTH AFRICA HAS ALREADY BEGUN QUIETLY PROMOTING </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, THE CURRENT DEPUTY CHAIR.  BOTH BRAMMER AND </p><p>BEZUIDENHOUT INDICATED THAT THE UPCOMING U.S.-SADC FORUM COULD BE </p><p>A GOOD PLACE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS, AND WE STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN INPUT ON POTENTIAL FORUM AGENDA ITEMS </p><p>(REFTEL).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>REFORM AND RESOLUTION SIDELINED...FOR THE MOMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  STRESSING THAT PROSPECTS FOR SADC SECTORAL REFORM ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY "NOT GOING ANYWHERE", BEZUIDENHOUT ADDED THAT THE EU HAD </p><p>ACCORDINGLY BEEN QUITE DISAPPOINTED DURING THE RECENT EU-SADC </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN VIENNA, AND THAT THERE WERE NO PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD </p><p>ON THE EU-FUNDED REFORM PROPOSAL.  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER AND </p><p>BEZUIDENHOUT, THE SECTORAL REFORM ISSUE HAD MET STRONG RESISTANCE </p><p>MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SMALLER SADC MEMBERS SUCH AS SWAZILAND, </p><p>LESOTHO, AND MALAWI, WHO ARE WORRIED THAT ANY REFORM (AND </p><p>"SURRENDER" OF CURRENT SECTORS) WOULD PERMANENTLY SIDELINE THEM </p><p>WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  BRAMMER ALSO INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>"NORTHERN" SADC MEMBERS, SUCH AS ZAMBIA, TANZANIA, AND ANGOLA, WERE </p><p>ALSO DETERMINED TO HOLD ON TO THEIR PORTFOLIOS.  ON A POSITIVE </p><p>NOTE, HOWEVER, BRAMMER SAID THAT THE ECONOMICALLY STRONGER </p><p>COUNTRIES, SUCH AS BOTSWANA, NAMIBIA, MOZAMBIQUE, AND EVEN TO SOME </p><p>EXTENT ZIMBABWE, WERE MORE OR LESS ALIGNED WITH SOUTH AFRICA ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE AND SAW THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERTAKING SOME SORT OF </p><p>STRUCTURAL REFORM AKIN TO THAT RECOMMENDED IN THE PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THAT SAID, BEZUIDENHOUT EMPHASIZED THAT BOTH THE CONFLICT </p><p>IN THE DROC AND LESOTHO HAD DOMINATED THE EU-SADC CONSULTATIONS, AT </p><p>THE EXPENSE OF INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS STRUCTURAL REFORM.  HE </p><p>DID ADD, HOWEVER, THAT AGENDA ITEMS FOR THE NEXT MEETING HAD BEEN </p><p>AGREED UPON, AND THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SMALL ARMS PROLIFERATION </p><p>WOULD BE INCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  BOTH BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT APPEARED RESIGNED TO THE </p><p>FACT THAT RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES OVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN </p><p>THE SADC CHAIR (PRESIDENT MANDELA) AND CHAIR OF THE ORGAN ON </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, AND DEFENSE (PRESIDENT MUGABE) WOULD SIMPLY </p><p>HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AT LEAST 1999, WHEN MANDELA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP ENDS. </p><p>MANDELA, THEY SAID, HAD DEFINITELY REACHED THIS CONCLUSION. </p><p>BRAMMER SAID THAT THE MULTI-COUNTRY (MALAWI, MOZAMBIQUE, AND </p><p>NAMIBIA) REPORT ON THE ORGAN ISSUE HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMALLY </p><p>PRESENTED TO SADC (THE SAG HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE PRESENTED DURING </p><p>THE MAURITIUS SUMMIT), AND WOULD MOST LIKELY REMAIN SHELVED. </p><p>INDEED, THE DFA OFFICIALS ALMOST APPEARED RELIEVED THAT MANDELA </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE TO FOCUS FURTHER ON THE ISSUE, AND EXPRESSED HOPE </p><p>THAT HIS SUCCESSOR (THE SAG IS ALREADY QUIETLY PROMOTING THE DEPUTY </p><p>CHAIR, CHISSANO OF MOZAMBIQUE) WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE THE ISSUE </p><p>FORWARD.  HOWEVER, BRAMMER STRESSED THAT WHILE THE CONFLICT </p><p>CONTINUES IN THE DROC, MUGABE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN ANY </p><p>RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUITY IN LIGHT OF DROC MISTAKE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  RATHER SHEEPISHLY ADMITTING THAT SOUTH AFRICA NOW </p><p>REGRETTED HAVING SUPPORTED DROC\'S INCLUSION AS A SADC MEMBER, </p><p>BRAMMER SAID THAT, THE CONFLICT ASIDE, HAVING DROC AS A MEMBER HAD </p><p>UNPLEASANTLY STRETCHED THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES OF SADC.  AS </p><p>BRAMMER EXPLAINED, ONLY SOUTHERN DROC (MAYBE) HAD A CULTURAL OR </p><p>ECONOMIC AFFILIATION WITH THE REST OF SADC, AND BY ADMITTING DROC, </p><p>SADC HAD ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PULLED INTO AN ESSENTIALLY CENTRAL </p><p>AFRICAN CONFLICT.  BRAMMER THEN NOTED THAT TO ALLOW FOR THE DROC\'S </p><p>SPEEDY ENTRY INTO SADC, PROCEDURAL RULES HAD BEEN BENT, WHICH IN </p><p>RETROSPECT, ONLY SERVED TO FURTHER EXACERBATE INTERNAL DIVISIONS. </p><p>IN LIGHT OF THAT DECISION, BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT BOTH STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE SAG WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COMMITTED CHAIR, SUCH AS </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, SELECTED IN 1999, ONE THAT WOULD PLACE EMPHASIS ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICY DECISIONS. </p><p>THEY ALSO COMPLEMENTED MOZAMBIQUE\'S FOREIGN POLICY APPARATUS FOR </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  BOTH OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT THE SAG WAS LOOKING FORWARD </p><p>TO THE UPCOMING U.S.-SADC FORUM AS A POSSIBLE MEANS TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>ON SOME ISSUES.  BOTH WELCOMED OUR REQUEST FOR INPUT ON POSSIBLE </p><p>AGENDA ITEMS OR AREAS OF CONCERN (REFTEL), BUT NOTED THAT THE DROC </p><p>WAS CONSUMING MUCH OF SADC\'S ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IT APPEARS THAT THE SAG HAS RESIGNED ITSELF TO THE FACT </p><p>THAT NO SIGNIFICANT SADC INSTITUTIONAL OR STRUCTURAL REFORM WILL </p><p>TAKE PLACE DURING THE REST OF MANDELA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES THE FEBRUARY MINISTERIAL IN LUSAKA AND THE SEPTEMBER 1999 </p><p>SUMMIT IN MAPUTO.  THAT SAID, BOTH BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE SAG REMAINS COMMITTED TO SADC AS AN INSTITUTION </p><p>IN THE LONG TERM, AND THAT THE SAG WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE </p><p>STRENGTHENING OF SADC AS A REGIONAL BODY, ESPECIALLY ON THE </p><p>ECONOMIC FRONT.  GIVEN THE EVER-STRENGTHENING TIES BETWEEN </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH AFRICA, THE SAG CLEARLY HOPES THAT A </p><p>MOZAMBICAN CHAIR WOULD GENERALLY SUPPORT SOUTH AFRICA\'S SADC </p><p>VISION.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG WOULD THEREFORE LIKE TO SEE CHISSANO </p><p>REPLACE MANDELA, IT SEEMS THAT THE ISSUE IS AN OPEN ONE, AND COULD </p><p>TAKE THE NEXT CHAIRMAN AS COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AS MANDELA WAS </p><p>TAKEN IN MASERU IN 1996.  TO THAT END, SOUTH AFRICA CLEARLY </p><p>REALIZES THAT SADC IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT - LITERALLY AND </p><p>FIGURATIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>JOSEPH </p><p></p></div>
