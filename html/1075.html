SUMMARY: THIS CABLE PROVIDES A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE </p><p>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN LAND REFORM IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE STATUS OF ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT SECOND PHASE OF ITS </p><p>LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMME (LRRP II), USAID AND </p><p>OTHER DONOR ASSISTANCE FOR LRRP II, AND THE STATUS OF THAT </p><p>ASSISTANCE AS A RESULT OF THE PRESENT FARM OCCUPATION PROBLEM IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THIS IS AN UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENT AND MAY BE SHARED </p><p>WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>2. IN JUNE 1998, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) RELEASED A </p><p>DRAFT "POLICY FRAMEWORK AND PROJECT DOCUMENT" FOR PHASE II OF </p><p>THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMME (LRRP II) SETTING </p><p>FORTH THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROPOSED POLICIES AND PLANS FOR PURSUING </p><p>A SECOND MAJOR PHASE OF LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WHILE DEFINITIONS MAY VARY, THE FIRST \'PHASE\' OF ZIMBABWE\'S LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM PROCEEDED SPORADICALLY SINCE INDEPENDENCE, WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  01 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>ONLY ABOUT 71,000 FAMILIES RESETTLED ON ABOUT 3.5 MILLION </p><p>HECTARES (HA) OF LAND.  THIS CURRENT SECOND PHASE OF THE PROGRAM </p><p>WAS LAUNCHED AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FAILED ATTEMPT TO COMPULSORILY ACQUIRE 1,471 COMMERCIAL FARMS IN </p><p>1997.  AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO ADHERE TO THE </p><p>LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSED ACTION, THE NET </p><p>RESULT OF THIS EFFORT, ASIDE FROM THE CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC </p><p>UNCERTAINTY THIS ACTION CAUSED, WAS THE IDENTIFICATION OF 118 </p><p>FARMS WHICH WERE UNCONTESTED BY THE OWNERS FOR PROGRAM </p><p>ACQUISITION/USE (REF A).  END COMMENT.)  AS DESCRIBED IN THIS </p><p>PROGRAM DOCUMENT, LRRP II IS AN AMBITIOUS FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR THE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT OF 91,000 FAMILIES (UP TO 550,000 PEOPLE, PLUS AN </p><p>UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF SECONDARY \'SPIN OFF\' BENEFICIARIES) ON </p><p>FIVE MILLION HECTARES (HA) OF LAND IN THE COUNTRY\'S LARGE-SCALE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR, AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF US$ 1.9 </p><p>BILLION. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONORS\' CONFERENCE ON LAND REFORM </p><p> </p><p>3. THE GOZ CONVENED AN INTERNATIONAL DONORS CONFERENCE ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE ON SEPTEMBER 9-11, 1998 TO ADDRESS DONORS\' </p><p>EXPRESSED INTEREST AND CONCERNS REGARDING LRRP II (REF B).  THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS ATTENDED BY SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL MAJOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL, MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL DONORS TO ZIMBABWE, AS </p><p>WELL AS KEY ZIMBABWEAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL, CIVIL SOCIETY, FARMERS\' </p><p>UNIONS AND PRIVATE SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS.  AT THE CONFERENCE, </p><p>DONORS UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED THE NEED FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>FOR PURPOSES OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION (FOR THE POOR INDIGENOUS </p><p>MAJORITY WITHIN THE COUNTRY\'S CONGESTED COMMUNAL AREAS), AND </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY.  THE DONORS\' MAJOR RESERVATIONS </p><p>REGARDING THE PROPOSED PROGRAM INCLUDED THE: (1) LACK OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  01 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A MASSIVE PROGRAM; </p><p>AND (2) A STRONG NEED/DESIRE FOR A MORE OPEN, TRANSPARENT AND </p><p>CONSULTATIVE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE (INCLUDING THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF MORE BOTTOM-UP, PARTICIPATORY AND MARKET-ORIENTED </p><p>APPROACHES TOWARDS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION, RATHER THAN SIMPLY </p><p>RELYING ON THE MORE TOP-DOWN AND DIRECTIVE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>ADMINISTERED APPROACHES OF LAND REFORM WHICH HAVE YIELDED POOR </p><p>RESULTS IN ZIMBABWE AND ELSEWHERE). </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THESE </p><p>CONCERNS, THROUGH A JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, GOVERNMENT AND DONORS AGREED TO AN INITIAL 24-MONTH </p><p>"INCEPTION PHASE" OF LRRP II TO BE PURSUED ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>FOLLOWING MAJOR PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES: </p><p> </p><p>-IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT RESETTLEMENT BEGINNING WITH THE 118 </p><p>UNCONTESTED FARMS ON OFFER; </p><p> </p><p>-IMPLEMENT CURRENT GOZ RESETTLEMENT MODELS AND PROVIDE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR TESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES; </p><p> </p><p>-UNDERTAKE ONGOING MONITORING DURING THE INCEPTION PHASE WITH AN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8342 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02271  02 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  UTED-00  FDRE-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------507B4E  271033Z /38 </p><p>P 271036Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5876 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 07 HARARE 002271 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.

MARKET-BASED APPROACHES: AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE DONORS\' LAND CONFERENCE WAS GOZ ACCEPTANCE </p><p>TO ALLOW ALTERNATIVE RESETTLEMENT MODELS AND TO PROCEED WITH </p><p>WORK ON LAND POLICY ISSUES THAT WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR LAND </p><p>TENURE REFORM.  ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED TO WORK ON POLICY ISSUES, </p><p>SUCH AS LAND TAXATION, SUBDIVISION, FARM SIZE LIMITATIONS, LAND </p><p>TENURE, ETC., THAT WOULD STIMULATE A LAND MARKET AND CREATE </p><p>INCENTIVES FOR EFFICIENT LAND USE REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>POLICY BREAKTHROUGH FROM PAST GOZ POSITIONS ON THIS SUBJECT. </p><p>DESPITE THE POLITICAL RHETORIC, GOZ TECHNICAL COUNTERPARTS </p><p>UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THESE CONCEPTS AND, IN FACT, PROGRESS IS </p><p>BEING MADE ON THESE ISSUES. IN THIS REGARD, UNDER THE NEW LAND </p><p>POLICY FRAMEWORK COMPLETED IN FALL 1999, A NEW PROGRESSIVE LAND </p><p>TAX HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CABINET FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION, DRAFT </p><p>REGULATIONS ON FARM SIZE LIMITATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, NEW </p><p>REGULATIONS ON LAND SUBDIVISION ARE ACTIVELY BEING PURSUED AND </p><p>LONGER-TERM PLANS FOR ADDRESSING WOMENS\' AND MORE GENERAL LAND </p><p>TENURE RIGHTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  COMMENT: AS DESCRIBED </p><p>BELOW (SEE PARA 13.B.), USAID ASSISTANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS </p><p>BEEN DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT ON THESE KEY </p><p>POLICY ISSUES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, REPRESENTED BY AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, </p><p>ISSUED A FORMAL STATEMENT AT THE CONFERENCE EXPRESSING OUR </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR "A LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT </p><p>IS TRANSPARENT, FAIR AND DOES NOT HARM THE IMPORTANT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  02 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY - IN ORDER TO CREATE THE </p><p>ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH - AS A MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE."  IN ADDITION, WHILE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING OUR FUNDING LIMITATIONS (AT THE TIME, THE USAID </p><p>MISSION TO ZIMBABWE WAS STILL SCHEDULED TO CLOSEOUT IN FY2003) </p><p>AND THE USG\'S INABILITY TO FINANCE COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION, </p><p>THE STATEMENT PLEDGED OUR DESIRE TO "REMAIN A REAL PLAYER IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM" THROUGH THE PROVISION OF </p><p>UNSPECIFIED "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN WAYS THAT THE COGNIZANT </p><p>AUTHORITIES DEEM USEFUL."  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO FUNDING AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT CONSTRAINTS, POSSIBLE USG ASSISTANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM </p><p>WAS LIMITED TO \'TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\' AS A MORE CAUTIOUS INITIAL </p><p>APPROACH TOWARD PROGRAM INVOLVEMENT.  WE CONSIDERED THIS </p><p>APPROACH PRUDENT AT THAT TIME, IN VIEW OF THE CONSIDERABLE </p><p>POLITICAL RHETORIC ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT OF LAND REFORM IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  WE ALSO BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT </p><p>TIME TO OBSERVE AND LEARN FROM THE PROGRESS AND RESULTS OF THE </p><p>PILOT INCEPTION PHASE BEFORE MAKING ANY MORE SUBSTANTIVE U.S. </p><p>FUNDING COMMITMENTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USG POSITION DID </p><p>NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL U.S. </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR LRRP II SHOULD THE INCEPTION PHASE PROVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8344 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02271  03 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  UTED-00  FDRE-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------507B5A  271033Z /38 </p><p>P 271036Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5877 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 07 HARARE 002271 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 1999, THE GOZ ISSUED THE PILOT "INCEPTION </p><p>PHASE FRAMEWORK PLAN -1999-2000" DOCUMENT, CALLING FOR THE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT OF 33,800 FARM FAMILIES (PLUS SOME 85,000 NON-FARM </p><p>FAMILY SECONDARY \'SPIN OFF\' BENEFICIARIES) OVER AN INITIAL 24- </p><p>MONTH PERIOD ON ONE MILLION HA OF LAND.   THIS INCEPTION PHASE </p><p>DOCUMENT DULY INCORPORATED ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS REACHED AT THE </p><p>DONORS\' LAND CONFERENCE, INCLUDING A FAIR, JUST, TRANSPARENT AND </p><p>HIGHLY CONSULTATIVE PROCESS; ALTERNATIVE AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT- </p><p>ADMINISTERED APPROACHES; AND WOMENS\' LAND RIGHTS AND </p><p>PARTICIPATION; ETC.).  ACCORDINGLY, IT RECEIVED WIDESPREAD </p><p>SUPPORT FROM ALL KEY LRRP II STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING ALL THREE </p><p>OF THE FARMERS\' UNIONS - CFU, ICFU, ZFU). </p><p> </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK </p><p> </p><p>7. DUE TO ITS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, LRRP II HAS A WIDE VARIETY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  03 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>OF STAKEHOLDERS LOCATED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURES.  ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE, THE KEY INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURE IS THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT (CRD), CHAIRED BY VICE-PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA, AND </p><p>CONSISTING OF THE MINISTERS OF LANDS AND AGRICULTURE; LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL HOUSING; RURAL RESOURCES AND WATER </p><p>DEVELOPMENT; NATIONAL AFFAIRS, EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND </p><p>COOPERATIVES; FINANCE; MINES, ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM; TRANSPORT </p><p>AND ENERGY; AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLANNING COMMISSION.  THIS </p><p>CABINET-LEVEL, DECISION-MAKING GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY A \'WORKING </p><p>PARTY\' OF THE CRD, COMPOSED OF PERMANENT SECRETARIES OF THE </p><p>ABOVE MINISTRIES, WHICH IN TURN IS SUPPORTED BY THE INTER- </p><p>MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>(IMCRD), COMPOSED OF HEADS OF PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENT </p><p>DEPARTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE KEY STRUCTURE FOR NON-GOVERNMENTAL INPUT INTO THE LAND </p><p>REFORM PROCESS IS THE LAND REFORM, RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT TASK FORCE (LAND TASK FORCE) OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM (NECF).  THE NECF LAND TASK FORCE IS </p><p>COMPOSED OF SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KEY NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL/CIVIL SOCIETY STAKEHOLDERS IN LAND REFORM IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, INCLUDING ALL MAJOR FARMERS\' AND FARM WORKERS\' UNIONS, </p><p>WOMENS\' GROUPS, UNIVERSITY/ACEDEMIC INTERESTS, AND OTHER </p><p>CONCERNED PRIVATE/NON-GOVERNMENTAL INTERESTS.  GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>ALSO REPRESENTED ON THE NECF LAND TASK FORCE AT THE WORKING </p><p>PARTY (PERMANENT SECRETARY) LEVEL OF THE CRD NOTED ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>9. DONOR AGENCIES "ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING LRRP II" ARE </p><p>REPRESENTED THROUGH A JOINT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND DONORS ON LAND REFORM ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE UNITED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  03 OF 07  271033Z </p><p>NATION\'S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP). </p><p> </p><p>10. FINALLY, A NEW TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT (TSU) IS NOW ALMOST </p><p>FULLY ESTABLISHED, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT OF </p><p>LRRP II, WHICH WILL INTERACT WITH ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS AT THE WORKING LEVEL TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE </p><p>PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, COORDINATION AND MONITORING OF PROGRAM </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM MANDATE, </p><p>ALL AGREED THAT THE TSU MERITED PRIORITY DONOR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>11. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS MEET </p><p>PERIODICALLY, AS REQUIRED, TO DISCUSS LRRP II POLICY, PLANS, </p><p>PROGRESS, ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAM </p><p>POLICY AND/OR IMPLEMENTATION CAN, AND DO FLOW IN ALMOST ANY </p><p>DIRECTION AMONG THESE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS, WITH FINAL DECISIONS </p><p>REFERRED TO THE CRD (AND EVENTUALLY TO PARLIAMENT FOR THOSE </p><p>ACTIONS REQUIRING LEGISLATION).  ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME, </p><p>WHEN GIVEN THE CHANCE, THESE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS HAVE </p><p>FUNCTIONED REASONABLY WELL IN THE PAST.

TOTAL ACTIVITY COSTS ARE FUNDED THROUGH </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS OF US$ 230,000 FROM EACH OF FOUR DONORS - SWEDEN, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  04 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS, NORWAY AND THE U.S.).  SINCE THIS PROJECT\'S </p><p>INCEPTION, SEVERAL OTHER DONORS, INCLUDING THE WORLD BANK AND </p><p>FRANCE, HAVE ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE UNIT OUTSIDE OF THIS UNDP AGREEMENT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS </p><p>KEY ROLE IN SUCCESSFUL LRRP II IMPLEMENTATION.  END NOTE.)  THE </p><p>UNDP PROJECT PROVIDES FOR TSU STAFFING AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, </p><p>AND ASSOCIATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING FOR LRRP II </p><p>POLICY ANALYSIS AND IMPLEMENTATION; PROGRAM PLANNING, PROCEDURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION; PROGRAM COORDINATION, </p><p>INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND PUBLIC RELATIONS; AND PROGRAM </p><p>MONITORING AND EVALUATION.  THIS MULTI-DONOR PROJECT IS </p><p>ADMINISTERED BY THE UNDP THROUGH ITS UMBRELLA \'BILATERAL\' </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE GOZ, WITH INDIVIDUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN EACH </p><p>OF THE FOUR PARTICIPATING DONORS AND UNDP.  THE UMBRELLA </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOZ AND UNDP WAS SIGNED ON MAY 19, 1999; </p><p>THE USAID-UNDP AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON AUGUST 2, 1999.  THE </p><p>PROJECT COMPLETION DATE IS MAY 31, 2001, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>INCEPTION PHASE\'S TWO-YEAR TIMEFRAME. </p><p> </p><p>B. THE OTHER USAID ACTIVITY - THE LAND POLICY REFORM </p><p>PROJECT (NO. 613-0249) - CONSISTS OF A US$ 1.5 MILLION </p><p>COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN USAID AND THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>WISCONSIN (MADISON)\'S LAND TENURE CENTER (LTC) TO PROVIDE </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING, CAPACITY BUILDING AND </p><p>RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF LRRP II POLICY ANALYSIS AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, AND PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION.  THE </p><p>GOZ SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THIS AREA IN </p><p>RECOGNITION OF LTC\'S PRE-EMINENT EXPERIENCE IN LAND REFORM </p><p>FOLLOWING OVER 30 YEARS OF WORK IN THIS AREA THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>WORLD.  IN AGREEMENT WITH ITS CAPACITY-BUILDING OBJECTIVES, </p><p>THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED WITH MAXIMUM ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  04 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>PARTICIPATION THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT WITH THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE\'S CENTER FOR APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCES </p><p>(CASS).  THE AGREEMENT WITH LTC WAS SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 29, </p><p>1999, INCLUDING PROVISION OF THE INITIAL US$ 800,000 </p><p>TRANCHE OF FUNDS.  THE SECOND TRANCHE OF INCREMENTAL </p><p>FUNDING OF US$ 700,000 IS PLANNED FOR FY2000, THEREBY FULLY </p><p>FUNDING THE $ 1.5 MILLION LTC AGREEMENT.  THE ACTIVITY </p><p>COMPLETION DATE IS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>13. ACKNOWLEDGING THE HIGH POLITICAL STAKES AND SENSITIVITY </p><p>SURROUNDING LRRP II, THE AGREEMENTS FOR BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES </p><p>PROVIDE "ESCAPE" CLAUSES, WHERE CONTINUING PROJECT ASSISTANCE </p><p>CAN BE REVIEWED, SUSPENDED OR EVEN TERMINATED SHOULD THE PROGRAM </p><p>NOT PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNIQUE AGREEMENTS REACHED </p><p>AT THE DONORS\' LAND CONFERENCE (SEE PARA 3. ABOVE).  HOWEVER, </p><p>BEFORE ANY UNILATERAL ACTION IS TAKEN, THE UNDP PROJECT </p><p>AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A TRI-PARTITE MEETING BETWEEN THE GOZ, </p><p>DONORS AND UNDP TO "IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY FORWARD - SHOULD ONE </p><p>OF THESE FACTORS CEASE TO PERSEVERE."  THE LTC COOPERATIVE </p><p>AGREEMENT INCLUDES NO SUCH MEETING REQUIREMENT, AND ACTION CAN </p><p>BE TAKEN UNDER THIS LATTER AGREEMENT AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8349 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02271  05 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  UTED-00  FDRE-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------507B72  271034Z /38 </p><p>P 271036Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5879 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 05 OF 07 HARARE 002271 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTING TO THE ABOVE </p><p>UNDP/TSU PROJECT, THE WORLD BANK AND THE FRANCE ARE THE ONLY </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES CURRENTLY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>LRRP II.  ALTHOUGH NOT YET FULLY OPERATIONAL, THE WORLD BANK </p><p>(WB) HAS SIGNED A US$ 5 MILLION \'LEARNING AND INNOVATION\' LOAN </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION, </p><p>WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL STAFFING SUPPORT FOR THE TSU AS WELL </p><p>AS SIGNIFICANT FUNDS FOR ALTERNATIVE RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES </p><p>(BUT NOT FOR LAND ACQUISITION COSTS).  THE BANK HAS ALSO </p><p>INDICATED ITS WILLINGNESS TO USE FUNDS FROM ITS EXISTING US$ 60 </p><p>MILLION COMMUNITY ACTION PROJECT (CAP) FOR LRRP II RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PURPOSES.  FRANCE IS ALSO PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE TSU IN THE </p><p>FORM OF LONG-TERM TECHNICAL ADVISORY SERVICES FOR PROGRAM </p><p>PLANNING, AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION, AS WELL AS A SMALL </p><p>AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES IN MASHONALAND </p><p>PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>15. BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE STATED THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  05 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>INTENTION TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LRRP II, AND </p><p>BOTH HAVE PREPARED PRELIMINARY PROJECT PROPOSALS FOR THIS </p><p>PURPOSE.  SIGNIFICANTLY, BRITAIN WAS THE ONLY DONOR CONSIDERING </p><p>FUNDING LAND ACQUISITION COSTS.  HOWEVER, WITH THE RECENT </p><p>TURBULENT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS - EXACERBATED GREATLY BY THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OBLIGING BRITAIN, AS THE FORMER </p><p>COLONIAL RULER, TO PAY FOR LAND ACQUISITION COSTS AND THE RECENT </p><p>FARM INVASIONS - BOTH OF THESE DONORS\' PLANS FOR LRRP II SUPPORT </p><p>HAVE NOW BEEN PUT ON HOLD, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF IN-COUNTRY </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AND DIALOGUE ON THIS SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRESS TO DATE </p><p> </p><p>16. AS A RESULT OF BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS, PROGRESS </p><p>IN IMPLEMENTING BOTH OF THE USAID-ASSISTED ACTIVITIES, AS WELL </p><p>AS ALL OTHER DONOR SUPPORT FOR LRRP II, HAS BEEN SLOW TO DATE. </p><p>MAJOR INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE DELAYS IN RECRUITING KEY STAFF </p><p>(FOR THE UNDP/TSU ACTIVITY) AND MEETING PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY </p><p>REQUIREMENTS (FOR THE WORLD BANK LOAN).  MAJOR EXTERNAL PROBLEMS </p><p>HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY PERIODIC GOZ RHETORIC AND/OR ACTIONS RELATED </p><p>TO THE LRRP II, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT AND HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LAND </p><p>ALLOCATIONS TO FAVORED BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>RESETTLEMENT SCHEME, AND PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS </p><p>PROVIDING FOR LAND ACQUISITION WITHOUT DUE COMPENSATION.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, FEW DONOR FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISBURSED TO DATE FOR LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION OR ACTUAL RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>PRIOR COMMITMENTS (NOTABLY AT THE DONOR CONFERENCE DISCUSSED </p><p>ABOVE) TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THESE MORE TANGIBLE </p><p>ASPECTS OF LRRP II. </p><p> </p><p>17. AS A RESULT OF THESE DELAYS, PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  05 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>MEETING INCEPTION PHASE TARGETS, WITH ONLY 59 FARMS (ABOUT </p><p>90,000 HA) ACQUIRED WITH NOW-EXHAUSTED GOZ FUNDS AND 1,700 </p><p>FAMILIES SETTLED (WITHOUT ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE) TO DATE. </p><p>THIS PROGRESS CONTRASTS WITH A FIRST YEAR TARGET FOR THE </p><p>INCEPTION PHASE OF ACQUIRING 250,000 HA. OF LAND, OR ABOUT 150 </p><p>FARMS.  SINCE DONOR FUNDING IS FOCUSED LARGELY ON ALTERNATIVE </p><p>MODELS FOR LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT, AND FEW DONOR FUNDS </p><p>HAVE BEEN DISBBURSED, THE BULK OF THE RESETTLEMENT UNDERTAKEN TO </p><p>DATE HAS BEEN ACCORDING TO THE MORE REGRESSIVE AND TOP-DOWN </p><p>GOVERNMENT-ADMINISTERED APPROACHES TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>NOTED ABOVE.  THEREFORE, LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN </p><p>TESTING AND PROMOTING THE MORE DESIRABLE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES </p><p>FOR THIS CRITICAL AREA OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>18. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, THIS SITUATION HAS CAUSED INCREASING </p><p>FRUSTRATION AMONG KEY GOZ DECISION-MAKERS AND COUNTERPARTS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS DRAW NEAR.  DESPITE ALL OF </p><p>THE RHETORIC ON THIS SUBJECT, HOWEVER, ALL FARMS ACQUIRED UNDER </p><p>THE PROGRAM TO DATE HAVE BEEN THROUGH CASH PAYMENT UP FRONT OF </p><p>FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THE LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS.

AS REPORTED IN REF (C), UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>(RESREP) CARLOS LOPES CHAIRED A MEETING ON MARCH 14 OF ALL </p><p>DONORS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE UNDP/TSU PROJECT TO DISCUSS AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE PROJECT AND DONOR RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT FARM </p><p>INVASIONS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE\'S LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMING AREAS (REFS D AND E).  AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT\'S LACK </p><p>OF ANY EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION, ALL DONORS INVOLVED </p><p>ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESSFUL </p><p>PROJECT (AND GREATER LRRP II) IMPLEMENTATION.  AS A RESULT, ALL </p><p>PRESENT AT THE MEETING, INCLUDING AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, </p><p>UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT UNDP WOULD DRAFT A LETTER TO THE GOZ </p><p>INDICATING OUR JOINT CONCERN REGARDING THIS SITUATION, OUR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE ACTIONS (AND/OR LACK THEREOF) </p><p>CONSTITUTED A BREACH OF THE AGREED UPON COMMUNIQUE AGREEMENTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  06 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>(ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE \'RULE OF LAW\'), AND OUR JOINT DECISION </p><p>TO FREEZE PROJECT FUNDS, WITH NO NEW MAJOR PROJECT COMMITMENTS, </p><p>UNTIL THIS SERIOUS LAND INVASION SITUATION IS DISCUSSED AND </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED.  THE LETTER ALSO REQUESTS A TRI-PARTITE </p><p>MEETING, AS CALLED FOR IN THE PROJECT AGREEMENT, TO DISCUSS THIS </p><p>DECISION AND SITUATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND IDENTIFY A WAY </p><p>FORWARD.  THE TWO-WEEK DEADLINE INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER EXPIRED </p><p>ON APRIL 11, WITH NO RESPONSE RECEIVED TO DATE FROM THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>20. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS DECISION, USAID SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO </p><p>NOTIFIED LTC, BOTH VERBALLY AND IN WRITING, OF OUR DECISION TO </p><p>EFFECT A SIMILAR FREEZE OR SUSPENSION OF ASSISTANCE UNDER THE </p><p>LTC COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT UNTIL THIS SITUATION IS PROPERLY </p><p>ADDRESSED.  LTC HAS CONSENTED TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST UNTIL </p><p>SUCH TIME AS THEY ARE NOTIFIED OTHERWISE.  THE INTENT OF THESE </p><p>ACTIONS IS TO SEND A STRONG JOINT SIGNAL TO GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>DONORS\' SERIOUS CONCERN REGARDING THIS SITUATION, WITHOUT AT </p><p>THIS TIME EFFECTING ANY ACTIONS WHICH WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE </p><p>OUR ABILITIES TO CONTINUE OUR LONGER-TERM SUPPORT FOR LRRP II, </p><p>IF/WHEN THIS SITUATION IS PROPERLY RECTIFIED.  THIS IS THE </p><p>PROGRAM\'S CURRENT STATUS.  THE MISSION WILL INFORM OF ANY NEW </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>21. COMMENT: ALTHOUGH PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW TO DATE, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THE INCEPTION PHASE, AS AGREED TO IN THE JOINT DONORS\' LAND </p><p>CONFERENCE COMMUNIQUE (SEE PARA 3.), REMAINS NOT ONLY RELEVANT, </p><p>BUT ALSO CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM LRRP II SUCCESS.  BY TESTING </p><p>ALTERNATIVE POLICIES AND APPROACHES TO LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT IN ZIMBABWE, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXERT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE COURSE OF GREATER LRRP II </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  GIVEN THE MASSIVE SCALE OF THIS PROGRAM AND ITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  06 OF 07  271034Z </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE </p><p>PROSPERITY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY.  FOR THIS </p><p>REASON (AND CONSIDERING GOVERNMENT\'S PAST FAILED EFFORTS IN THIS </p><p>AREA), MISSION FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE ORIGINAL PILOT RATIONALE </p><p>FOR THE INCEPTION PHASE REMAINS VALID AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>22. DESPITE THE START-UP PROBLEMS AND DELAYS EXPERIENCED IN </p><p>INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION TO DATE, FOR ANYONE TO DECLARE </p><p>FAILURE AT THIS TIME IS PREMATURE.  MOST OF THE KEY DONOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION WAS ALMOST IN </p><p>PLACE (INCLUDING THE CRITICAL MISSING LAND ACQUISITION </p><p>INGREDIENT WHICH WAS IN FINAL PREPARATION BY BRITAIN) WHEN THE </p><p>CURRENT FARM INVASION CRISIS BEGAN.  IN ADDITION, KEY TECHNICAL </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL COUNTERPARTS KNOW </p><p>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM EXECUTION AND, IF </p><p>GIVEN THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH DONORS, WOULD PROBABLY DO IT WELL. </p><p>FINALLY, DESPITE THE CURRENT NEGATIVE DIALOGUE ON THIS SUBJECT, </p><p>MOST DONORS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM\'S FUNDAMENTAL NEED </p><p>AND RATIONALE.
