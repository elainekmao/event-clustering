DEAN BY </p><p>REASON 1.5 (A) AND (E) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) WHEN THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>GIULIO TREMONTI, HE PRAISED ITALIAN ACTION IN FREEZING </p><p>TERRORIST ASSETS, INQUIRED HOW ECONOMIC REFORM WAS </p><p>PROGRESSING AND MADE A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THE JOINT STRIKE </p><p>FIGHTER WAS IN ITALY\'S TECHNOLOGICAL AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  TREMONTI WAS PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL FINANCIAL SECURITY COMMITTEE WAS WORKING TO </p><p>IDENTIFY AND FREEZE TERRORIST ASSETS, DESCRIBED HIS PROGRESS </p><p>AND PROBLEMS WITH IMPLEMENTING ECONOMIC REFORM, PARTICULARLY </p><p>IN THE AREAS OF TAX AND PENSION REFORM, FRETTED ABOUT </p><p>FINANCING PUBLIC DEBT IN A EURO CAPITAL MARKET, AND WAS </p><p>INTERESTED IN OUR ARGUMENT SUPPORTING THE JSF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WAR ON TERRORISM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR SEMBLER PAID A COURTESY CALL ON FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER GIULIO TREMONTI WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 23.  ALSO PRESENT </p><p>WERE U/S DOMINICO SINISCALCO AND DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>GUGLIERMO ARDIZZONI.   IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE HIGH LEVEL OF ITALIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00474  01 OF 02  310905Z </p><p>COOPERATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE FINANCIAL WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM, TREMONTI SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE </p><p>OPERATION OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL SECURITY </p><p>COMMITTEE.  HE PRAISED IT AND ITS BI-MONTHLY MEETINGS, AS </p><p>FRUITFUL, EFFICIENT, WORKING IN CLOSE COOPERATION, AND </p><p>CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVELY MONITORING LISTS FROM US AND THE E.U., </p><p>BUT ALSO CAPABLE OF GENERATING ITS OWN LISTS.  (COMMENT:  WE </p><p>FIND THIS IS A RARE EXAMPLE OF A STRONG, FUNCTIONING </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE.  MUCH OF ITS OPERATIONAL SUCCESS </p><p>BELONGS TO TREMONTI AND SINISCALCO.  END COMMENT).  TREMONTI </p><p>AND SINISCALCO NOTED THAT ACTUAL PERFORMANCE IS EVEN BETTER </p><p>THAN IT APPEARS BECAUSE THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO LISTS.  ONE IS </p><p>THE LEGAL LIST, WHICH HAS JURIDICAL DIMENSIONS, AND ONE IS AN </p><p>OPERATIONAL LIST FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES WHICH </p><p>ALLOWS A WIDER HORIZON OF SURVEILLANCE AND INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE ECONOMY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ON THE ECONOMY, TREMONTI </p><p>THEN PRESENTED A LIST, SHOWING THE STATUS OF ACTION ON ALL OF </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER\'S FINANCIAL CAMPAIGN PROMISES.  EVERY ONE </p><p>HAD BEEN ENACTED INTO LAW (E.G., REFTEL) EXCEPT THE REFORM OF </p><p>THE TAX LAW AND OF THE PENSION SYSTEM.  THESE ARE TWO OF THE </p><p>MOST DIFFICULT AREAS, AND ONES THAT LIE OUTSIDE OF THE SOLE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE MINISTRY.   THEY EXPECT TO MAKE PROGRESS IN </p><p>THESE TWO AREAS, ALTHOUGH THE UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE DEFICIT THAT </p><p>THE TREMONTI GROUP HAD FOUND WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN OFFICE HAS </p><p>MADE TAX REFORM MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.   (COMMENT:  PREVAILING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00474  01 OF 02  310905Z </p><p>GLOBAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND DECLINING TAX REVENUES, </p><p>PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL GAINS, ALSO HAS PUT PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOI\'S COFFERS). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) TAX REFORM, HOWEVER, IS A HIGH PRIORITY BECAUSE IT </p><p>WAS CENTRAL TO THE BERLUSCONI CAMPAIGN.  TAX REFORM IS A </p><p>PROMISE THAT BERLUSCONI IS COMMITTED TO KEEPING.  MANAGING </p><p>THE BUDGET AND THE DEFICIT (AND INDIRECTLY THE TIMING OF TAX </p><p>REFORM) DEPENDS ON THREE THINGS:  THE COMMISSION, THE ITALIAN </p><p>ECONOMY AND ITALY\'S OWN CONTROL (I.E., LEGISLATION, </p><p>DEVOLUTION OF EXPENSES TO THE REGIONS, ETC.)).  EXPENSES FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WERE NOT OVERWHELMING AND COULD BE MANAGED. </p><p>LEGALLY, TAX CUTS MUST BE COVERED BY OTHER MEANS.  (NOTE: </p><p>RECOVERY CANNOT TECHNICALLY BE SPREAD OUT OVER TIME, BUT MUST </p><p>OCCUR IN THE SAME TAX YEAR.)  THIS HAS BLOCKED A CERTAIN </p><p>AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SPENDING.  TREMONTI REMAINED CONFIDENT THAT </p><p>IT COULD BE DONE HOWEVER, SAYING THAT "SINCE 1992, WE HAVE </p><p>DROPPED MANY POINTS IN THE DEFICIT/GDP RATIO; WE ARE ONLY </p><p>TALKING ONE OR PERHAPS 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS NOW".  (COMMENT: </p><p> THE GOI OFFICIALLY MAINTAINS THAT THE DEFICIT WILL BE 1.1 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2001.  WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS </p><p>ARE IN, THE DEFICIT WILL BE CLOSER TO 1.3 PERCENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) NONETHELESS, TREMONTI IS LOOKING FORWARD TO </p><p>STARTING THE TAX REFORM DISCUSSION.  HE ANTICIPATES A NEW </p><p>FISCAL FEDERALISM, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT SURE WHEN THAT WOULD </p><p>BE.  THE FIRST STEP WILL BE A SIMPLIFICATION OF THE MULTIPLE, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5696 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00474  02 OF 02  310905Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     ACQ-00   CA-01 </p><p>      CCO-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBO-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OCS-03   OMB-01   OPIC-01  OPR-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  USSS-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------5FE230  310905Z /38 </p><p>R 310845Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1901 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000474 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOD PASS TO OSD - STEVE WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EFIN, FAS, IT, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: FINMIN VIEWS ON JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, TERRORIST </p><p>ASSETS, THE EURO AND THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00474  02 OF 02  310905Z </p><p>SOMETIMES CONFLICTING, LAWS ON TAXATION.  THE NEXT STEP WOULD </p><p>BE TO REDUCE THE TAX BRACKETS AND TO REDUCE THE RATE OF TAX. </p><p> (COMMENT:  SIMPLIFICATION IS A CHARACTERISTIC GOAL FOR </p><p>TREMONTI.  HE CLEARLY USES IT AS A CRITERION FOR ACTION AND </p><p>IT WAS A CRITERION UNDERLYING THE LAWS THAT WERE ALREADY </p><p>PASSED.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>THE EURO </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) ON THE INSTITUTION OF THE EURO, TREMONTI SAID THERE </p><p>WAS NO IMPACT OPERATIONALLY.  THINGS WERE GOING WELL. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC DEBT IS HIGH AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME </p><p>THE COST OF FINANCING THE PUBLIC DEBT BECOMES MUCH MORE </p><p>TRANSPARENT.  THE FINANCING RATE BECOMES CRITICAL, BUT HAVING </p><p>A SINGLE CURRENCY SHOULD MAKE THE PROCESS MORE COMPETITIVE </p><p>AND MORE EFFECTIVE.   TREMONTI\'S CONCERN IS THAT ITALY STAY </p><p>WITHIN THE MAASTRICHT TREATY GUIDELINES.   STATING THAT THE </p><p>ITALIAN GDP WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO BOTH THE GLOBAL AND U.S. </p><p>ECONOMIES, TREMONTI WAS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN A POTENTIAL </p><p>US ECONOMIC RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR MADE A CLEAR EXPLANATION OF THE </p><p>BENEFITS TO ITALY ON JSF PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY AT A </p><p>FULL LEVEL TWO COMMITMENT.  HE EXPLAINED THE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS THE RETURN ON JSF SALES TO ITALY AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00474  02 OF 02  310905Z </p><p>A PARTNER.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT THE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION WAS NOT JUST FOR ONE COMPANY BUT COULD INCLUDE </p><p>COMPANIES ACROSS ITALY.  HE MADE CLEAR THAT ITALIAN </p><p>PARTICIPATION WOULD BE WELCOME, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN </p><p>STAGE, AS AN AREA OF ITALIAN STRENGTH AND THAT LOCKHEED IS </p><p>AWARE OF MANY SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE </p><p>COMPETITIVE FOR CONTRACTS.   HE ALSO MENTIONED THE LOOMING </p><p>DECISION DEADLINE AS REAL BECAUSE LOCKHEED IS CONTRACTUALLY </p><p>OBLIGATED TO THE USG TO ASSIGN CONTRACTS (THE POINT OF </p><p>INTENSE ITALIAN INTEREST) IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  (COMMENT.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR MADE THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE INDUSTRY POINTS </p><p>BECAUSE WE HAVE FOR SOME TIME BELIEVED THAT ALENIA\'S GIORGIO </p><p>ZAPPA, WHO IS NEGOTIATING FOR ALL OF ITALIAN INDUSTRY, IS NOT </p><p>REPRESENTING ANYONE\'S INTERESTS BUT ALENIA\'S.  THUS, WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERALL IS LESS THAN FULLY </p><p>KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT MIGHT ACCRUE TO ITALY </p><p>FROM THE JSF.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TREMONTI SAID THAT THE DECISION WAS GOING TO BE MADE </p><p>BY BERLUSCONI.  FINANCE\'S ONLY RESPONSIBILITY IS "WE WILL </p><p>PAY".  HE DID NOT PROFFER ANY VIEWS ON THE DIFFERENCES </p><p>BETWEEN A DECISION TO BUY-IN AT ONE BILLION VERSUS EIGHT </p><p>HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.  NOR DID THEY HAVE THE DETAILS. </p><p>DESPITE SAYING THAT FINANCE WILL PAY, TREMONTI WAS EXTREMELY </p><p>INTERESTED IN THE MECHANICS:  WOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE ABLE TO </p><p>WRITE THE MONEY FOR JSF INTO AN INVESTMENT CATEGORY, AS AN </p><p>ACQUISITION OF EQUITY, OR WOULD IT HAVE TO BE LISTED AS AN </p><p>EXPENDITURE?  WOULD THE MONEY GO TO ITALIAN FIRMS, THE USG OR </p><p>US CORPORATIONS?
