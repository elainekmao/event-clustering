<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/TRA </p><p>ROME FOR FAA </p><p>PARIS FOR TSA </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR TSA, FAA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, ATRN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH CIVIL AVIATION DIRECTOR CEBECI REPLACED </p><p> </p><p>This message is sensitive but not classified.  Not for </p><p>internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Topa Bilgetin Toker was reinstated on April 1 as </p><p>Director General of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation </p><p>(DGCA), replacing Serdar Cebeci.  Toker, who was discharged </p><p>for unspecified reasons in August 2002, had filed a lawsuit </p><p>against the state.  The court recently determined that Toker </p><p>had been fired without cause, and therefore reinstated him as </p><p>Director General.  Sources at the DGCA told us the </p><p>reinstatement of Toker had been a legal decision, and had </p><p>nothing to do with the AK Party Government.  One DGCA source </p><p>said AK was not likely to replace Toker any time soon, given </p><p>Toker,s successful lawsuit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment:  We do not anticipate that this change will </p><p>affect Turkey,s aviation policy.  Like Cebeci, Toker is an </p><p>approachable contact.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
