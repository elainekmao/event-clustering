<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003316 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, PREL, PGOV, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT FORMS HIGH-LEVEL IAWG TO EXPLOIT GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND PRIVATE-SECTOR DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 3266 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 206458 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Kuwait has inaugurated a high-level interagency </p><p>working group to coordinate government and private sector </p><p>programs for participation in the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p>Embassy and GOK interlocutors see this development as an </p><p>excellent opportunity to promote the economic and regulatory </p><p>reforms essential to attracting non-energy related investment </p><p>to Kuwait.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Ref B note verbale invited the GOK to designate a </p><p>representative for appointment to the Council for </p><p>International Cooperation (CIC) in Iraq.  CIC was created 17 </p><p>June under Regulation No. 5 issued by the Administrator of </p><p>the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to facilitate </p><p>greater international involvement in the CPA,s funding and </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Embassy strongly endorses CPA,s decision for Kuwaiti </p><p>participation in the CIC.  We view that offer as perhaps an </p><p>important opening for the sui generis economic reform we push </p><p>for in Kuwait as well as a useful tool in our post-war </p><p>bilateral political kit.  In the weeks prior to the CPA,s 17 </p><p>July formal request, EconChief met with key private sector </p><p>and government officials at the working and policy levels who </p><p>then already were evaluating the potential for Kuwaiti </p><p>collaboration with the CPA in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The concept of direct, private-sector Kuwaiti involvement </p><p>we have promoted has resonated nicely at our post-election </p><p>meetings with such interlocutors as Minister of Finance </p><p>Mahmoud Al-Nouri; Ministry of Finance Asst. U/S for Economic </p><p>Affairs Mustafa Al-Shamali; Ministry of Finance Asst. U/S for </p><p>Financial Affairs Fawzi Al-Qassar; Higher Committee for </p><p>Economic Development and Reform Secretary General Fawzi </p><p>Al-Sultan; Kuwait Investment Authority Managing Director </p><p>Ahmad Bastaki; Central Bank Manager for Inspections and </p><p>Licensing Yaqoub Al-Ebrahim; Mr. Waleed Al-Humaidhi, member, </p><p>Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Indeed, very </p><p>senior members of the new 5 July government have promoted the </p><p>idea of considering a market-oriented development plan for </p><p>Kuwait.  In these public discussions, private sector </p><p>opportunities in Iraq frequently have surfaced as a potential </p><p>vehicle for such reform. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Kuwait,s continuing behind-the-scenes action and </p><p>interest in developing the Iraqi market is substantive and </p><p>impressive.  Several of our para 5 interlocutors played key </p><p>roles in the GOK,s interagency &brainstorming8 discussions </p><p>held during May and June to evaluate private sector </p><p>opportunities in Iraq.  By 10 July, the group had been vetted </p><p>personally by Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah and formally </p><p>charged with continuing to plan a role for Kuwait,s </p><p>parastatal and private sector participation in the rebuilding </p><p>of Iraq.  A major impetus for this effort is the $37.5 </p><p>billion that the GOK quantifies as the minimum owed Kuwait by </p><p>Iraq for pre-war loans; GOK oil sales on behalf of Iraq </p><p>during the Iran/Iraq War; and previously agreed, but still </p><p>unpaid compensation claims. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Kuwaiti IAWG is tentatively titled, Work Team to </p><p>Support the Construction of Iraq (Work Team).  Its </p><p>institutional members include: the Public Authority for </p><p>Compensation; Kuwait Investment Authority; Kuwait Petroleum </p><p>Corporation; Kuwait Fund; the Arab Fund; Kuwait Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry; Secretariat General of the Higher </p><p>Committee for Economic Development and Reform.  This Work </p><p>Team has developed under the direction of now Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs/Acting Minister of Social Affairs Sheikh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah who chaired the Team,s </p><p>first plenary session on 16 June.  The Secretariat General of </p><p>the Higher Committee for Economic Development and Reform </p><p>(Reform Committee) coordinates Work Team\'s day-to-day </p><p>operations effectively. </p><p> </p><p>7.  EconChief met 16 July with Reform Committee Secretary </p><p>General Fawzi Al-Sultan, for a read out on the Work Team,s </p><p>progress.  SecGen Fawzi launched into an upbeat staccato </p><p>presentation, noting that his agency considers the market </p><p>potential of Iraqi as Kuwait,s &best bet to roll the wheels </p><p>of economic reform.8  He said it,s the GOK,s official (in </p><p>public and private) expectation that under CPA,s tutelage, </p><p>Iraq could emerge from its present troubles a strong, </p><p>democratic and market-oriented society.  His group had, he </p><p>noted, debated thoroughly a draft set of strategies on how </p><p>best to capitalize on an anticipated CPA success in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Fawzi concurred that the following areas are ripe for </p><p>reform in Kuwait:  intellectual property rights; greater </p><p>acceptance/implementation of WTO; tax law transparency with </p><p>across-the-board equality in treatment; expedited </p><p>administrative procedures for imports, exports and company </p><p>registrations; and streamlined licensing regimes.  He agreed </p><p>that a suitable framework for addressing these issues </p><p>deliberately could start at the working level with renewed </p><p>discussions on Double Taxation, BIT and TIFA agreements. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Fawzi volunteered that Kuwait,s size of the Iraq </p><p>reconstruction pie necessarily would depend on successful </p><p>reform of Kuwait,s present and trade-inhibiting regulatory </p><p>structures.  He said he would urge GOK to take the necessary </p><p>steps.  (Septel describes our initial meeting with Ministry </p><p>of Finance officials regarding a Double Taxation Treaty.) </p><p> </p><p>10. The SecGen next listed Iraq market opportunities his team </p><p>had identified as potentially advantageous to Kuwait in a </p><p>CPA-regulated trade regime.  Even minor successes in these </p><p>areas, he asserted, would facilitate the task of moving </p><p>forward on reform: </p><p> </p><p>--  Private Sector: Private security services, </p><p>transportation/marketing services; catering and food </p><p>production; mobile telecommunications systems; housing and </p><p>tourism. </p><p> </p><p>--  Public Sector:  Passenger air traffic to Baghdad via </p><p>Kuwait flag carrier; provision of emergency medical services; </p><p>police training; development of border security regime; </p><p>integration of Kuwait/Iraq power grids for load-sharing; </p><p>development of a joint port authority; Free-Trade Zones; </p><p>development of Iraq gas reserves; bank supervision and </p><p>licensing; securities market and exchange operations. </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment.  Publicly and privately, the GOK is making the </p><p>right sounds and moving in the right direction with intent </p><p>and deliberation it seems.  How committed domestic power </p><p>brokers are to the substantial reform needed to make Kuwait </p><p>more attractive for investors and competitive in non-energy </p><p>industry remains unclear, however.  In our conversations with </p><p>knowledgeable sources, we hear that much will depend on the </p><p>reception the GOK and Kuwaiti private sector entrepreneurs </p><p>receive in Baghdad.  Some national pride, and a lot of money </p><p>will be riding on the efforts of the Work Team to Support the </p><p>Construction of Iraq.  Kuwaitis are concerned that changes in </p><p>the U.N. compensation fund, a re-structuring of payments on </p><p>Iraqi,s debt to Kuwait and anticipated Kuwaiti contributions </p><p>to a donor countries, reconstruction program for Iraq, will </p><p>affect Kuwait adversely.  In compensation, Kuwait can be </p><p>expected to seek a major role for its private sector and </p><p>parastatals in rebuilding Iraq.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Minimize considered. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
