Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule April </p><p>6.  Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  According to Amman Al-Dustur daily on 5 April, </p><p>"prominent" Jordanian figures have expressed appreciation for </p><p>Prime Minister Ali Abu-al-Raghib\'s move of summoning the U.S. </p><p>ambassador on 3 April and informing him of Jordan\'s </p><p>categorical rejection of the "U.S. aggression against Iraq </p><p>and the massacres the American and British soldiers have </p><p>perpetrated against the brotherly Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  The situation in Jordan was calm April 5.  No </p><p>demonstrations were reported in Amman.  A demonstration of </p><p>400-500 people took place in Irbid without incident.  There </p><p>was also a candlelight march scheduled in Irbid at 1930, but </p><p>it was not expected to become violent. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  As of 1545 hrs local April 6, the situation in Jordan </p><p>was calm.  A demonstration of 200 was held at a religious </p><p>university in Amman without incident.  A group of lawyers </p><p>were denied permission to march from the court to the Prime </p><p>Ministry and instead held a 45 minute "strike" within the </p><p>courthouse.  Speeches are planned at a Union Complex in the </p><p>evening. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  Embassy interlocutors representing American fast </p><p>food and soft drink companies report that business is down, </p><p>but not as much as it was the week beginning March 30 . </p><p>While to date there has been no indication of an organized </p><p>boycott, some sermons in the mosques over this past weekend </p><p>called for boycotts of American and British products.   In </p><p>addition, franchise owners said there has been no violence or </p><p>vandalism against their shops or infrastructure but are </p><p>worried that the bombing yesterday of a McDonald\'s near </p><p>Beirut may spawn copycats in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The Amman Stock Exchange continued its trend of </p><p>heavier-than-normal volume from last week and closed up by 1% </p><p>on Sunday. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Local newspapers quoted the Middle East Economic </p><p>Survey as saying that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will supply </p><p>Jordan with free crude oil for three months to replace Iraqi </p><p>oil.  According to MEES, Kuwait will give Jordan 25,000 </p><p>barrels of crude oil and Saudi Arabia 50,000 on a daily basis. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The PM told the Ambassador April 6 that an increasing </p><p>number of reports were surfacing of canceled QIZ orders and </p><p>reduced volumes of new orders.  The Ambassador noted that we </p><p>have received a few reports of order cancellations, but that </p><p>the volumes were not yet unexpectedly high.  He told the PM </p><p>that the greater concern among QIZ exporters, as we </p><p>understood it, was the continued closure of the Sheikh </p><p>Hussein Bridge due to an ongoing Israeli customs strike, </p><p>which was restricting access to Israeli inputs for QIZ goods. </p><p> The Ambassador assured the PM that we are keeping close, </p><p>regular tabs on QIZ developments, and have already met in </p><p>Washington with U.S. garment importers to impress upon them </p><p>our continued support for the initiative.  He added that both </p><p>Washington agencies and the Embassy have offered to talk to </p><p>any U.S. importers who have concerns or questions about the </p><p>QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  The Jordan-Iraq border remains open with the Iraqi </p><p>side still controlled and staffed by Iraqi government </p><p>officials.  IOM reports that three TCNs entered Jordan from </p><p>Iraq overnight (April 5-6); still no sign of any Iraqi </p><p>refugees or asylum seekers. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Refcoord and DART-West member visited Ruweished\'s </p><p>TCN transit and refugee camps on April 5.  The Jordan Red </p><p>Crescent-run TCN transit camp, initially planned to </p><p>accommodate short-term residents, is struggling to </p><p>accommodate a longer-term population of approximately 100 </p><p>Somalis and Sudanese who refuse to return home.  (Total </p><p>transit camp population is currently 249.)  As long as the </p><p>numbers of longer-term residents remain low, minor water & </p><p>sanitation problems in the camp should remain manageable. </p><p>UNHCR\'s still-empty refugee camp is well-organized and able </p><p>to accommodate an immediate influx of up to 5,000 refugees. </p><p>UNHCR reports that it is spending USD 1,000 per day to keep </p><p>the empty camp open & ready to accommodate refugees.  Further </p><p>details will be reported septel. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU)  PA contacts reported that a group of journalists, </p><p>including representatives from CBS and Sky television, </p><p>arrived safely on Saturday in Baghdad.  The safe arrival of </p><p>this group has prompted other journalists to show interest in </p><p>crossing the border from Jordan into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
