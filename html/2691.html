<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: BALKANS: GOI ON ASSISTANCE FOR BOSNIAN MILITARY </p><p>DOWNSIZING, SUPPORT FOR ALBANIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 52433 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(C). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01589  281828Z </p><p>1.  (C)  GUIDANCE REQUEST.  SEE PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE MFA\'S BALKANS OFFICE DIRECTOR, MAURIZIO MASSARI, </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 27 THAT THE GOI WILL MAKE A FINANCIAL </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR </p><p>MIGRATION\'S PROGRAM TO HELP REINTEGRATE THE 10,000 BIH </p><p>SOLDIERS TO BE DISCHARGED BY 1 APRIL.  MASSARI WAS AWARE OF </p><p>THE IOM\'S PROGRAM (AS DESCRIBED IN REFTEL), AND THE GOI IS </p><p>VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INITIATIVE.  MASSARI DID NOT HAVE AN </p><p>AMOUNT OR TIMING ON THE CONTRIBUTION, BUT ASSURED POLOFF THAT </p><p>THE ISSUE WAS UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE MFA\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION DEPARTMENT.  THE REINTEGRATION FUNDS, ALONG WITH </p><p>OTHER PROJECTS AIMED AT BOSNIAN YOUTHS AND ESTABLISHING </p><p>COMMUNITY CENTERS, WERE HIGH ON THE LIST OF THE GOI\'S </p><p>PRIORITIES FOR ASSISTANCE TO BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  TURNING TO ALBANIA, MASSARI THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL TO THE NEW MAJKO GOVERNMENT TO GET A "SHOW OF SUPPORT" </p><p>FROM THE WEST.  MASSARI WILL ATTEND THE APRIL 17 FRIENDS OF </p><p>ALBANIA MEETING IN VIENNA, AND WILL BE CRAFTING A GOI </p><p>STATEMENT WHICH, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING ALBANIA\'S PROBLEMS, WILL </p><p>CONTAIN POSITIVE ELEMENTS TO BOLSTER MAJKO.  MASSARI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED POLOFF\'S POINT THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH NEWS </p><p>COMING OUT OF TIRANA TO CHEER ABOUT, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA </p><p>OF ECONOMIC REFORM, BUT INSISTED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>GIVE A POSITIVE SIGNAL, PERHAPS JUST AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF </p><p>ALBANIA\'S RELATIVE POLITICAL STABILITY.  MASSARI ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE U.S. COULD ALSO DELIVER A STATEMENT WITH A </p><p>"POSITIVE TONE" AT THE FOA.  POLOFF PROMISED TO CHECK WITH </p><p>WASHINGTON AND GET BACK TO MASSARI. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01589  281828Z </p><p>4.  (C)  MASSARI SAID THAT ANOTHER WAY TO GIVE SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>MAJKO GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE MAINTENANCE OF AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE IN ALBANIA, SPECIFICALLY THE APPROXIMATELY </p><p>1350 NATO FORCES (1200 OF WHOM ARE ITALIAN) CURRENTLY </p><p>DEPLOYED TO ALBANIA IN COMMZ WEST .  MASSARI WAS AWARE OF </p><p>DISCUSSIONS IN BRUSSELS TO RESTRUCTURE FORCES DEPLOYED IN THE </p><p>BALKANS, BUT HOPED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>REDUCTION IN ALBANIA.  MASSARI SAID THAT THE GOI WOULD BE </p><p>MAKING A FORMAL DEMARCHE ON THIS ISSUE IN BRUSSELS AND NATO </p><p>CAPITALS SOMETIME SOON. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01589 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
