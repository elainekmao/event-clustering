CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  POLOFFS MET WITH VELJKO DZAKULA AT HIS REQUEST JUNE 6. </p><p>HE WANTED TO SUGGEST CONCRETE MEASURES TO BEGIN THE </p><p>SERIOUS REINTEGRATION OF THE REMAINING SERB AND RETURNING </p><p>CROAT COMMUNITIES OF WESTERN SLAVONIA.  DZAKULA ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT BETWEEN 800 TO 1000 SERBS WERE STILL LIVING IN PAKRAC </p><p>COUNTY AND ANOTHER 200 REMAINED IN OKUCANI.  HE EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THIS REMAINING SERB POPULATION WAS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>REORGANIZE THEIR LIVES UNDER A CROAT-CONTROLLED SYSTEM, </p><p>BUT THE CROATIANS HAD SHOWED LITTLE GOODWILL SO FAR TOWARD </p><p>KEEPING THE SERBIAN POPULATION IN THE AREA.  HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>GOC OFFICIALS HAD PROMISED DZAKULA TO WORK TOWARDS </p><p>ENCOURAGING SERBS TO RETURN FROM BOSNIA AND SECTOR EAST, </p><p>HE SAID, BUT LITTLE HAD COME OF THESE TALKS.  THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (MUP) WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>MILITARY-AGE MEN TO GET CITIZENSHIP PAPERS (DOMOVNICA), </p><p>ALTHOUGH WOMEN AND ELDERLY HAD RECEIVED THEM.  DZAKULA HAD </p><p>BEEN OFFERED A DOMOVNICA, BUT REFUSED TO ACCEPT ONE UNTIL </p><p>EVERY SERB IN THE COUNTY RECEIVED HIS.  DAILY CIVIL LIFE </p><p>WAS STILL A PROBLEM.  ABOUT 180 MEN WERE STILL JAILED </p><p>AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR ARMED REBELLION EVEN THOUGH AN </p><p>AMNESTY HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED AND GOC OFFICIALS HAD PROMISED </p><p>TO RELEASE THEM.  EVEN MUNDANE THINGS SUCH AS GATHERING </p><p>WOOD FOR FUEL HAD BECOME A PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DZAKULA IDENTIFIED THREE PRECONDITIONS WHICH WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02227  01 OF 02  091142Z </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE DISPLACED TO RETURN TO WESTERN SLAVONIA. </p><p>THE AMNESTY DECLARED BY THE GOC HAD TO BE COMPLIED WITH </p><p>AND EVEN BROADENED TO INCLUDE  NOT ONLY ARMED REBELLION, </p><p>BUT ALSO ORGANIZING, SALE OF WEAPONS, AND OTHER SIMILAR </p><p>CHARGES.  ONLY THOSE SERBS AND CROATS CHARGED WITH WAR </p><p>CRIMES SHOULD NOT BE PARDONED.  THE REMAINING PRISONERS IN </p><p>CROAT JAILS HAD TO BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY IF THERE WERE </p><p>NO PENDING WAR CRIMES CHARGES AGAINST THEM.  SECOND, A </p><p>MORATORIUM MUST BE IMPOSED ON THE DRAFTING AND </p><p>MOBILIZATION INTO THE CROATIAN ARMY OF SERBS FROM WEST </p><p>SLAVONIA.  SERBS DISPLACED TO BANJA LUKA AND ELSEWHERE </p><p>MUST BE MADE TO FEEL THEY WOULD RETURN FROM AN AREA OF WAR </p><p>TO AN AREA OF PEACE IN WESTERN SLAVONIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THIRD, THE POLITICAL COMPOSITION OF THE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT TO BALANCE THE TWO </p><p>POPULATIONS.  THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF SO MANY POLICE TO </p><p>PROTECT THE POPULATION WAS ENCOURAGING BUT THE POLICE </p><p>FORCE NEEDED TO BE REORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>CENSUS OF 1991.  WHILE DZAKULA ACKNOWLEDGED THE SMALL </p><p>REMAINING POPULATION OF SERBS IN THE AREA MADE </p><p>REPRESENTATION PROPORTIONAL TO THE 1991 CENSUS FIGURES </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, HE CLAIMED THAT THERE </p><p>WERE SEVERAL QUALIFIED SERBIAN POLICEMEN IN THE REGION WHO </p><p>WISHED TO RETURN TO THEIR PREVIOUS JOBS.  ON JUNE 7, THE </p><p>GOC HAD ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO MONITOR </p><p>THE PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION OF THE PAKRAC AND LIPIK </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  THIS COMMITTEE WOULD CONSIST OF FIVE </p><p>MEMBERS, TWO OF WHICH WOULD ALWAYS BE SERBS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S PRESIDENT.  ALTHOUGH SUPPORTIVE OF CREATING </p><p>JOINT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, DZAKULA INSISTED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02227  01 OF 02  091142Z </p><p>THE SERBS MUST HAVE A SAY IN THE CREATION OF SUCH </p><p>STRUCTURES, AND NOT HAVE THEM IMPOSED.  HE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>FACT THAT THE GOC-PROPOSED BODY WOULD HAVE A CROAT </p><p>MAJORITY, AND THAT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE ADVISORY DUTIES, </p><p>WITH ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENT ON ACTION BY THE </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY CROAT COUNTY COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DZAKULA SUGGESTED SEVERAL CONCRETE CONFIDENCE-BUILDING </p><p>MEASURES THAT MI </p><p>GHT CREATE GOODWILL BETWEEN THE LOCAL SERB </p><p>POPULATION AND RETURNING CROATS.  A CONVOY SHOULD BE </p><p>ORGANIZED TO TRANSPORT OVER ONE HUNDRED SERBS DISPLACED IN </p><p>1991 TO SEE THEIR DESTROYED HOMES IN THE NORTHERN, CROAT- </p><p>CONTROLLED AREA OF FORMER SECTOR WEST.  IMMEDIATE CREDITS </p><p>TO REBUILD HOMES NEEDED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO BOTH </p><p>CROATS AND SERBS IN THE REGION.  SUCH FUNDING OUGHT TO BE </p><p>DONE ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, HE SUGGESTED, SINCE THE </p><p>GOC HAD SUPPLIED NO SUCH CREDITS TO SERBS SO FAR.  A THIRD </p><p>SUGGESTION FOCUSED ON REBUILDING THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR </p><p>THE LOCAL PEOPLE.  MANY LOCALS IN THIS AGRICULTURAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WHO HAD REMAINED HAD SOLD THEIR LIVESTOCK AND </p><p>FARM EQUIPMENT IN THE PAST MONTH TO CROATS AT EXTREMELY </p><p>LOW PRICES, AND WERE LEFT WITH NO READY SOURCE OF FOOD OR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ1906 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1906 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02227  02 OF 02  091142Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  EB-01 </p><p>      FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    LAB-01   L-01 </p><p>      ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00 </p><p>        /031W </p><p>                  ------------------CE1D3B  091142Z /38 </p><p>P 091225Z JUN 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6080 </p><p>INFO USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 002227 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: 5/10/1996 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02227  02 OF 02  091142Z </p><p>TAGS:  PREL PHUM PGOV UN HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  SERB LEADER DZAKULA SUGGESTS MEASURES FOR </p><p>          CONFIDENCE-BUILDING AND ENCOURAGING SERB RETURN </p><p> </p><p>METHOD TO TILL THEIR LAND IN THESE SUMMER MONTHS.  DZAKULA </p><p>SAID THAT SUCH FAMILIES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CONFISCATED </p><p>ANIMALS OF SERBS WHO HAD LEFT THE REGION (UNTIL THE LATTER </p><p>GROUP RETURNED) AND SHOULD BE SOLD BACK THEIR EQUIPMENT TO </p><p>CONTINUE THEIR LIVELIHOODS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE CROATS MUST NOT WAIT FOR THE OTHER THREE SECTORS </p><p>TO BE REINTEGRATED TO SOLVE THE "SERBIAN PROBLEM."  THAT </p><p>PROCESS MUST BE STARTED NOW, INSISTED DZAKULA.  LOCAL </p><p>SERBS BELIEVE THERE IS AN EXTREME RESISTANCE ON THE PART </p><p>OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO COOPERATION WITH THE SERB </p><p>POPULATION.  THE REMAINING SERBS WERE QUICKLY LOSING FAITH </p><p>AND THEIR WILL TO STAY.  GROUPS SUCH AS "THE ASSOCIATION </p><p>FOR CROATIAN REFUGEES" MUST BE RENAMED AND BEGIN WORK TO </p><p>RETURN ALL REFUGEES IN CROATIA, INCLUDING SERBS, CROATS </p><p>AND OTHERS.  THERE WERE 14,000 DISPLACED CROATS FROM THE </p><p>AREA, BUT 75,000 DISPLACED SERBS, HE SAID.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>75,000 FIGURE IS FOR SERBS DISPLACED IN 1991 AND SINCE.) </p><p>THE GOC MUST BEGIN TO SHOW IT WAS INTERESTED IN SOLVING </p><p>THE PROBLEMS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.  ONLY THEN WOULD THE </p><p>FLEEING SERB POPULATION BEGIN TO RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
