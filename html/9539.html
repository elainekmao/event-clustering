Under headline "China shows the way" the pro- </p><p>      government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its July 20 </p><p>      editorial to hailing China\'s "efforts to encourage and </p><p>      promote a diplomatic solution" over a crisis stemming from </p><p>      North Korea\'s alleged nuclear weapons program.  Excerpts </p><p>      follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The vast Asian country\'s efforts to encourage </p><p>      and promote a diplomatic solution of the current nuclear </p><p>      controversy are commendable and serve to show the direction </p><p>      in which all attempts to resolve the this thorny issue </p><p>      should take.  On the contrary, the Bush administration has </p><p>      been pressing the Security Council for action on North </p><p>      Korea, an effort Pyongyang tried to stop in a letter to the </p><p>      Council last month. . .The recent experience of the Iraq </p><p>      invasion. . .should serve as a lesson on how not to </p><p>      approach the North Korean issue.  And unlike Iraq, North </p><p>      Korea does have a weapons of mass destruction program in </p><p>      place, which makes the threat of nuclear war more than a </p><p>      real possibility. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
