<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES ECONOMICS WITH DEPUTY PM SENER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  In his initial call on Deputy PM Sener </p><p>December 2, Ambassador stressed that the USG wanted the </p><p>government\'s economic program to succeed, highlighted the </p><p>important role financial markets would play in the coming </p><p>months, and suggested those markets would be looking for a </p><p>strong primary budget surplus, privatization, further bank </p><p>reform, and continuation of a strong, independent bank </p><p>regulator.  In his positive but very general response, Sener </p><p>said the GOT\'s top economic challenges were reducing </p><p>inflation and the public debt, indicated the government would </p><p>work within the existing IMF program, and stressed the need </p><p>for accelerated privatization.  He called the primary surplus </p><p>"key," but did not mention a number; he also did not comment </p><p>on banking.  Sener also gently noted concerns about the </p><p>economic impact of a possible Iraq operation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador paid an initial call December 2 on Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener, who is responsible for </p><p>economic issues and oversees (directly or indirectly) the </p><p>Privatization Administration and the Bank Regulatory and </p><p>Supervision Agency (BRSA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Ambassador said the USG wants the new government\'s </p><p>economic program to succeed, and also wants to support that </p><p>program.  He noted that the government\'s most severe critic </p><p>would be investors, and urged the government -- as it </p><p>implements its program -- to keep its eye on the markets.  By </p><p>next Spring, he noted, Turkey is likely to send its economic </p><p>team to London and New York to woo investors, and it will be </p><p>important that those investors like what the new government </p><p>will have done.  They will be looking specifically for a </p><p>large primary surplus, further privatization, continued </p><p>banking reform, and maintenance of a strong, independent bank </p><p>regulatory agency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Sener responded that the new government had </p><p>inherited the problems of high inflation, a large public </p><p>debt, and volatile growth.  It also inherited an economic </p><p>program worked out with the IMF.  "From an economic point of </p><p>view, it is not wise to stop or radically change such a </p><p>program."  In fact, Sener added, the existing program shares </p><p>the new government\'s goals of cutting inflation, reducing the </p><p>debt stock, and promoting sustainable growth.  As a result, </p><p>the government\'s intent is to continue with the existing </p><p>program, while adding some details important to the AK Party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Sener called the primary surplus "key" to reducing </p><p>interest rates and the debt stock.  Public sector reform is </p><p>also important.  In that context, Sener said privatization </p><p>was important not only to generate revenues, but also to </p><p>increase economic efficiency.  He complained that </p><p>privatization had largely stopped in the past two years, and </p><p>said the government would work to develop a good, rapid </p><p>privatization program for 2003.  Sener predicted that the </p><p>suffering from the economic program would end soon, and </p><p>commented positively that the program gives more emphasis to </p><p>growth in the coming years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Sener noted that a group of Western business </p><p>executives who had visited him earlier in the day had asked </p><p>about the economic impact of a possible Iraq operation. </p><p>Ambassador responded that the USG hoped that the combination </p><p>of the UN resolution and strong international pressure would </p><p>convince the Iraqi regime to disarm without war.  Should a </p><p>military operation be necessary, the USG would seek to </p><p>protect the Turkish economy (and the economic program) as </p><p>much as possible from the impact, while maintaining a close </p><p>dialogue with the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  Some of Sener\'s statements -- such as </p><p>noting the importance of the primary surplus, playing down </p><p>the social problems associated with the economic program, and </p><p>highlighting the congruence between AK\'s goals and those of </p><p>the current IMF program -- hint at a backing away from some </p><p>of AK\'s more troubling economic statements.  On the other </p><p>hand, Sener did not address banking reform, which is a major </p><p>question mark now, and his comments were so general that they </p><p>left a lot of wiggle room. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
