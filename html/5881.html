RIO 00160 </p><p>     B. 02 BRASILIA 04567 </p><p>     C. 02 BRASILIA 04364 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  On February 6, Embassy hosted a </p><p>Roundtable on Electricity Regulation in Brazil with </p><p>participation by 16 executives from 8 U.S. and European </p><p>companies from both the generation and distribution sides. </p><p>Companies\' main concerns were short-term liquidity issues, </p><p>continued low electricity demand, and the upcoming periodic </p><p>review of tariff rates.  Companies were clearly anxious over </p><p>the new GoB\'s impending reformulation of sector regulation, </p><p>and most attendees noted that their companies have halted </p><p>further investments in Brazil pending the emergence of a </p><p>clear regulatory model.  Nonetheless, all company </p><p>representatives termed their access to GoB officials as </p><p>"good" and their initial impressions of Minister of Mines and </p><p>Energy (MME) Dilma Roussef as positive.  Groundwork was laid </p><p>for a continuing dialogue between the private sector and the </p><p>Mission.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  As part of a mission-wide strategy to coordinate </p><p>our policy approach in Brazil\'s energy sector, on February 6 </p><p>the Ambassador hosted a diverse group of electric utilities </p><p>including U.S. companies Alliant, Duke, Enron, AES, Mirant, </p><p>and PSEG, as well as European companies EDP (Portuguese), and </p><p>Tractebel (Belgian).  Grupo Cataguazes (Brazilian) and Endesa </p><p>(Spanish) were last minute no-shows.  Ambassador and CG Rio </p><p>had already hosted a similar event for hydrocarbon companies </p><p>in ConGenRio during the last week of January (ref A). </p><p>Ambassador and CGs have also been meeting frequently with </p><p>U.S. companies on a one-on-one basis.  Econ and commercial </p><p>officers followed-up the February 6 roundtable by making a </p><p>courtesy call on MME Secretary for Energy Marcelo Poppe. </p><p>Ambassador expects to make her initial call on Roussef during </p><p>the week of February 24. </p><p> </p><p>Background to a Mess </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3. (U)  The timing and concerns of the roundtable reflect the </p><p>current confusion and uncertainty surrounding the electricity </p><p>sector.  In the mid-90s, the Cardoso administration embarked </p><p>on an ambitious privatization program to attract much-needed </p><p>investment to the state-dominated energy sector.  The process </p><p>was poorly implemented from the start, as Congress failed to </p><p>pass comprehensive sector reform legislation similar to that </p><p>created for the telecommunications sector via the General Law </p><p>of Telecommunications.  Instead, Congress carried out the </p><p>process piece-meal.  Congress first legalized the sale of </p><p>states\' distribution companies.  In 1995, Espirito Santo sold </p><p>its distribution company ESCELCA to a group of foreign </p><p>investors.  U.S. companies, led by AES, began investing in </p><p>1996. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Reform legislation continued to trickle through </p><p>Congress, resulting in the creation of the national </p><p>electricity regulator ANEEL in 1997, and the creation of the </p><p>wholesale energy market (MAE) in 1998.  Although the National </p><p>Council for Energy Policy (CNPE), a committee within the MME, </p><p>was given responsibility for long-term policy planning, the </p><p>weakness of the MME as an institution encouraged ANEEL to </p><p>step into the policy realm and complete the sector reform </p><p>process de facto through regulation.  CNPE has met only three </p><p>times to discuss long-term policy.  Roussef has commented on </p><p>various occasions that the MME will "recapture the policy </p><p>role" from ANEEL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Devaluation at the beginning of 1999 presented the </p><p>first warning signal for foreign companies whose debts were </p><p>dollar-dominated, but whose revenue streams were in Brazilian </p><p>reals.  Since 1999 the dollar has appreciated approximately </p><p>200 percent in nominal terms against the real.  For </p><p>distribution companies, this has been partially compensated </p><p>by annual GoB tariff adjustments based on a broad-based </p><p>inflation index -- 87 percent over the same period.  Currency </p><p>risk has also put a damper on thermal-generation investment, </p><p>as the cost of turbines, fuel, and natural gas are </p><p>dollar-linked. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  The privatization process met growing political </p><p>resistance in 2000 when the government\'s plan to privatize </p><p>state generator giant FURNAS faltered amidst popular </p><p>discontent.  The process then stalled-out completely with the </p><p>electricity shortage and subsequent government-mandated </p><p>rationing in 2001.  Although the outgoing government received </p><p>high marks for managing the rationing crisis, it was unable </p><p>to make progress on a comprehensive reformulation of the </p><p>regulatory model, leaving this major headache for the new </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  The GoB also failed to provide permanent fixes to </p><p>institutions such as the MAE (see ref C), the CNPE, and </p><p>ANEEL.  Although the GoB ended rationing in February 2002, </p><p>deleterious after-effects continue to affect generators and </p><p>distributors as electricity end-users have rolled back their </p><p>consumption to 1999 levels.  Lower demand, combined with </p><p>abundant rains that have filled reservoirs in Brazil\'s 90 </p><p>percent hydro-dominated system, has led to an electricity </p><p>surplus depressing spot prices to their regulated price floor </p><p>- approximately 1.15 dollars per megawatt hour.  This is </p><p>unfortunate timing as a pre-planned phased liberalization of </p><p>the market freed 25 percent of the market\'s bilateral </p><p>electricity contracts held between generators and </p><p>distributors on January 1, 2003.  This electricity, estimated </p><p>to be between 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts of capacity, remains </p><p>unsold.  Generators have begun to assert that the government, </p><p>or distributors, must find a way to share the pain for the </p><p>depressed prices. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  In summary, the new government of President Lula has </p><p>inherited an electricity sector mess.  Dollar-linked debt, </p><p>depressed supply prices, institutional gridlock, </p><p>macroeconomic constraints (i.e., inflation-target and </p><p>fiscal-surplus limits), and the supposed left-leaning </p><p>platform on which the new government rode into power all </p><p>raise doubts among investors for the long-run viability of </p><p>the electricity sector. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  In addition to putting out some of the fires above, </p><p>the new government must now define a sector model, </p><p>principally deciding what role private finance, current and </p><p>future, will play. Roussef, a former 1970s guerilla (ref B), </p><p>spent the first month putting her team together, and from all </p><p>accounts is serious, frank, and intelligent. Despite these </p><p>positive attributes, industry anxiety regarding her plans for </p><p>the sector and the outcome of the new model is running high. </p><p> </p><p>Distributors Focus on Tariff Reviews </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>10. (U)  Not surprisingly, distributors at the roundtable </p><p>seemed most focused on short-term issues.  First on their </p><p>mind was this year\'s periodic tariff reviews, which are </p><p>conducted every four to five years depending on the date of </p><p>each distributor\'s concession contract.  This year, ANEEL </p><p>will conduct 17 tariff reviews with the goal to restore </p><p>"financial equilibrium" to distributors, and split </p><p>productivity gains between distributors and consumers. </p><p>During the event distributors lamented that financial </p><p>equilibrium remains an undefined term. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) In November 2002, ANEEL announced it would use </p><p>companies\' current asset values as the basis for calculating </p><p>the capital value of each distributor, a key component in the </p><p>methodology for conducting the 2003 tariff reviews.  This </p><p>announcement came as a surprise to industry as the GoB had </p><p>used an altogether different basis to determine the capital </p><p>value of each distributor when seeking minimum bid prices </p><p>during privatization in the late 90s.  During that period, </p><p>ANEEL determined the capital value of the company on the </p><p>projected discounted revenue stream of the distributor. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  ABRADEE (the primary distributors\' association in </p><p>Brazil) immediately objected to ANEEL\'s proposed use of </p><p>current asset value to determine capital value, and has since </p><p>led the charge against its implementation.  ABRADEE asserts </p><p>that the depreciation in the Brazilian real since 1998 has </p><p>eroded the asset value of sector companies, and that the use </p><p>of this methodology would result in an insufficient increase </p><p>in tariffs.  ABRADEE has proposed instead that the capital </p><p>value of the company be computed as it was for the minimum </p><p>bid prices used during privatization.  An estimated 26 </p><p>billion reals over the next five years industry-wide are in </p><p>play in this decision that will lead to either an average 20% </p><p>to 25% tariff increase, if ANEEL\'s methodology is used, or an </p><p>average 40% increase, if ABRADEE\'s is. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  ABRADEE has already been dealt an initial defeat as </p><p>two successive federal judges have declined the association\'s </p><p>request for an injunction on the current tariff reviews.  On </p><p>February 17, ANEEL released its formula for the first three </p><p>reviews for public comment.  The agency also stated that </p><p>distributors receiving high tariff adjustments following the </p><p>review would have them implemented in "parcels", starting </p><p>this year and continuing into the future in order to lessen </p><p>the impact on consumers. </p><p> </p><p>Short-term Liquidity Crunch </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>14. (SBU)  For some distributors, short-term liquidity </p><p>problems rank ahead of tariff concerns.  AES, for example, </p><p>has a total Brazil-related debt running into the billions, </p><p>with a large percentage of it short-term and dollar-linked. </p><p>With a depreciated real and 1999 levels of electricity </p><p>demand, AES simply cannot make the receipts to cover its </p><p>debt.  The company also continues to experience large losses </p><p>from municipal government non-payment.  AES told Ambassador </p><p>in a private meeting that municipalities owe 400 million </p><p>reals to AES distributor Eletropaulo alone. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU)  Distributors told us that short-term fixes, i.e., </p><p>90-day debt rollovers, are not helpful, and that most </p><p>important is GoB acceptance of companies\' rights to a </p><p>reasonable level of return.  One of their suggestions is to </p><p>increase tariffs on industrial consumers.  Currently, </p><p>Brazil\'s residential consumers pay rates several times that </p><p>of industrial consumers.  While such increases may seem, at </p><p>first glance, more politically acceptable to the new </p><p>left-leaning GoB than increasing the electricity bill of the </p><p>average consumer, roundtable participants told Embassy </p><p>officers that the GoB was not likely to increase rates on </p><p>industrial consumers for fear of reducing their own campaign </p><p>funds. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU)  Another option highlighted was a reduction in </p><p>taxes.  Distributors commented that approximately 27 percent </p><p>of consumers\' electricity bills are tax.  The great majority </p><p>of this is ICMS, a state tax.  Distributors told us that the </p><p>corresponding tax burden in the United States was about six </p><p>to seven percent.  However, roundtable participants were </p><p>pessimistic on the prospects of the GoB reducing taxes. </p><p> </p><p>Generators Not Overly Concerned by Single-Buyer Concept </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>17. (U)  As mentioned above, government-mandated rationing, </p><p>abundant rains, and the phased liberalization of 25 percent </p><p>of bilateral electricity contracts has depressed wholesale </p><p>electricity prices.  A longer-term problem facing the </p><p>government is how to diversify Brazil\'s electricity mix.  The </p><p>majority of policy-makers concede that some non-hydro </p><p>generation is desirable to avoid dramatic fluxes as seen </p><p>during the 2001 drought when dry reservoirs in three out of </p><p>Brazil\'s four regions combined with inadequate transmission </p><p>infrastructure to push prices to 650 reals per megawatt on </p><p>the spot market.  However, new thermal plants with higher </p><p>amortization and fuel costs simply cannot compete with older </p><p>hydro plants in normal conditions. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U)  One idea for dealing with price fluctuations and </p><p>creating incentives for future generation investment is MME\'s </p><p>vaguely stated proposal to create a single buyer to trade </p><p>energy between a pool of generators and individual </p><p>distributors.  Theoretically, such a trader would pay thermal </p><p>generators higher prices than amortized hydro plants, thus </p><p>arriving at an unified average cost of energy.  This would </p><p>maintain profitability for thermal generators who face </p><p>difficulties covering their costs when abundant rains make </p><p>hydro cheap.  Going into the roundtable, we had expected to </p><p>hear vehement industry objections to this proposal, but were </p><p>surprised to see generally neutral attitudes on the subject. </p><p>More GoB specifics on this proposal should emerge in upcoming </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>Opinions on Current Government Guarded; Access to GOB Good </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>19. (SBU)  Companies told Ambassador that their access to the </p><p>new government has been "good."  They report that Roussef </p><p>appears to be direct, strong-willed, and opinionated, but </p><p>also fair and intelligent.  This echoes what we\'ve been </p><p>hearing in private one-on-one meetings with U.S. companies, </p><p>and reinforces the commonly-held notion that it was Roussef\'s </p><p>drive that achieved the partial resolution wholesale </p><p>electricity market (MAE) accounts in early January.  Roussef </p><p>spent most of her first four weeks in office placing trusted </p><p>advisors in key positions throughout the energy sector.  Now </p><p>that her team is built, Roussef appears to be moving directly </p><p>to reformulation of the electricity sector model.  A </p><p>Brazilian weekly quipped that if the GoB followed the </p><p>McDonald\'s best practices, Roussef would be "Minister of the </p><p>Month." </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) Diligent performance in her first 30 days has raised </p><p>industry expectations of Roussef\'s capabilities, as well as </p><p>industry hope that the GoB "shares the pain."  The GoB does </p><p>indeed appear willing to accept that it has some </p><p>responsibility toward finding a solution for the sector </p><p>crisis.  In a February 6 meeting with econoff and commercial </p><p>officers, Secretary for Energy Marcelo Poppe said the MME has </p><p>formed a working group to present a reformulated model by </p><p>July, with a period of public comment to follow. A report in </p><p>national daily Estado de Sao Paulo on February 13 quoted MME </p><p>Executive Secretary Mauricio Tolmasquim as saying that the </p><p>MME would introduce a package of refinancing intended to </p><p>assist companies to survive until the new model is </p><p>implemented sometime near the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusion and Comment </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>21. (SBU)  The future role of private finance in the </p><p>Brazilian electricity sector is unclear, and likely to remain </p><p>so until at least July.  The GoB has already said its future </p><p>model will be a mixed model of public and private investment. </p><p> It may be that the future MME plan will trade large </p><p>potential profits, private investment, and efficiency gains </p><p>for a less efficient, but more stable sector with lower </p><p>returns.  Eletrobras President Pinguelli Rosa has been quoted </p><p>as saying 15 to 20 percent returns are "unrealistic," and </p><p>praised the French system as more reliable with 5 to 10 </p><p>percent returns. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU)  Pending the new model\'s definition, the GoB must </p><p>find a way to deal with distributors\' short-term liquidity </p><p>problems.  Many of these private investors are requesting </p><p>that the government (i.e., development bank BNDES, </p><p>Eletrobras, and the state generators) "take a haircut" on a </p><p>portion of the distributors\' outstanding debts, some of which </p><p>predate privatization. However, convincing the current GoB to </p><p>write down debts created by its predecessor is an unlikely </p><p>prospect.  Eletrobras has its own stockholders who will balk </p><p>at big bailouts, and though new BNDES President Carlos Lessa </p><p>originally called his organization a "hospital for sick </p><p>companies," his sentiment has been publicly rebutted by </p><p>Minister of Finance Antonio Palocci. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU)  The primary alternative to refinancing deals is </p><p>reversion of concessions to the GoB.  Such a move would </p><p>result in long legal challenges, and one also wonders if the </p><p>GoB would really wish to manage these utilities.  Our </p><p>earliest indications are that Roussef herself, despite her </p><p>original extreme-left ideology, now does not want to </p><p>"refederalize" companies. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU)  Mission will continue to engage U.S. business, and </p><p>maintain open dialogue with the GoB as it formulates its </p><p>model.  We will lend support to ABRADEE\'s proposal for tariff </p><p>revision methodology, and urge options to improve companies\' </p><p>financial health while limiting cost increases to residential </p><p>consumers.  GoB options, in this context, include urging </p><p>local governments to pay up, reducing taxes on electricity, </p><p>and redressing the imbalance between residential and </p><p>industrial tariffs.  Over the longer-term we will seek </p><p>opportunities to strengthen institutions such as ANEEL and </p><p>the MAE, and promote cooperation between policy planning </p><p>organizations such as the Brazilian CNPE (National Council </p><p>for Energy Policy) and the United States Energy Information </p><p>Administration. </p><p> </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
