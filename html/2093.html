<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/RF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PINS, PREL, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY: WHY AND WHAT NEXT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HO CHI MINH CITY 1201 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>-     B.  HANOI 2276 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT BELLARD,  REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  FATHER LY\'S HARSH SENTENCE STEMS FROM </p><p>THE VERY DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS THE VIETNAMESE HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02789  01 OF 02  241032Z </p><p>ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.  IT ALSO REFLECTS </p><p>HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO CHALLENGES TO NATIONAL UNITY. </p><p>THE TIMING IS UNLIKELY RELATED TO THE RATIFICATION OF </p><p>THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT OR THE CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT, NOR IS THE SENTENCE MEANT </p><p>PRIMARILY TO SEND ANY SIGNAL TO THE U.S. (ALTHOUGH IT </p><p>CLEARLY DOES).  PASSAGE OF THE VHRA WOULD EXACERBATE </p><p>VIETNAMESE SENSITIVITIES AND MAKE THE GVN MORE, NOT </p><p>LESS, INCLINED TO GET TOUGH ON WOULD-BE ACTIVISTS AND </p><p>REFORMERS.  CONSISTENT USG MESSAGES OF OPPOSITION TO </p><p>FATHER LY\'S SENTENCE AND CALLS FOR HIS RELEASE WILL BE </p><p>INEFFECTIVE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ARE </p><p>NONETHELESS NECESSARY.  THE GVN IS UNLIKELY TO WELCOME </p><p>OR AGREE TO A VISIT BY THE U.S. COMMISSION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, BUT IT IS WORTH MAKING </p><p>A VIGOROUS CASE FOR IT WITH THE VIETNAMESE NOW.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE FIFTEEN YEAR CUMULATIVE SENTENCES LEVIED </p><p>ON FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY ON OCTOBER 19 (REF A) REPRESENT </p><p>A BLOW TO VIETNAM\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE IN 2001 </p><p>AND A SETBACK TO THE OVERALL TREND OF EXPANDED </p><p>RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES OVER THE PAST DECADE.  EMBASSY HAS </p><p>ALREADY NOTED OUR DEEP REGRET ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT TO </p><p>THE MFA.  BOTH THE EMBASSY AND CONGEN HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS IN HANOI AND IN HUE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SOME OFFICIALS AT THE MFA, BUT PERHAPS FEW AT </p><p>OTHER GVN AGENCIES OR WITHIN THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02789  01 OF 02  241032Z </p><p>PARTY, UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS </p><p>VERDICT ON THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND ESPECIALLY ON </p><p>THE ONGOING SENATE DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE VIETNAM </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACT, WHICH THE GVN AND VCP ACROSS THE </p><p>BOARD OPPOSE STRENUOUSLY.  BUT THE VIETNAMESE VIEW OF </p><p>FATHER LY\'S CASE DIFFERS FUNDAMENTALLY FROM OUR OWN; </p><p>TO THE GVN AND VCP, THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUE BUT RATHER A CASE INVOLVING ILLEGAL POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVISM AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE STATE AND SOWING </p><p>DISUNITY AMONG THE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE VIETNAMESE VIEW IS THAT FATHER LY (AND </p><p>ALL THOSE IN THE OFFICIAL CHURCHES AND OTHER AUTHORIZED </p><p>RELIGIOUS ENTITIES) HAS THE FREEDOM TO PRACTICE HIS </p><p>FAITH -- AS LONG AS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES DO NOT VEER </p><p>INTO WHAT ARE DEEMED POLITICAL REALMS.  IN THEIR </p><p>MINDSET, ANYTHING THAT IS PERCEIVED AS EVEN REMOTELY </p><p>CHALLENGING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE VCP, UNDERMINING THE </p><p>AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, OR VIOLATING NATIONAL </p><p>SOLIDARITY FALL INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY.  THEY SEE </p><p>FATHER LY AS A LONG-TIME MALCONTENT (WHO FAILED TO </p><p>LEARN A LESSON EVEN FROM AN EARLIER 10 YEAR SENTENCE </p><p>FOR ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES), WHO INCREASINGLY IN </p><p>2000 AND 2001 REFUSED TO HEED THE "WELL-INTENTIONED" </p><p>WARNINGS OF THE VCP AND GVN AGAINST CONTINUING SUCH </p><p>"SUBVERSIVE" ACTIVITIES.  THEY ESPECIALLY SEE HIS </p><p>FEBRUARY TESTIMONY TO THE U.S. COMMISSION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS BORDERING ON </p><p>TREASON, SINCE THEY BELIEVE HE WAS SEEKING TO GET THE </p><p>U.S. TO INTERVENE IN VIETNAMESE INTERNAL AFFAIRS, A </p><p>CARDINAL SIN HERE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02789  01 OF 02  241032Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TO THE EXTENT THAT AVERAGE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE </p><p>KNOW ABOUT FATHER LY (MORE NOW FOLLOWING HIS TELEVISED </p><p>CONVICTION), THEY PROBABLY ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>HE WAS INDEED ENGAGED IN SOMETHING HE SHOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN AND WAS ASKING FOR TROUBLE.  EVEN THE BISHOP OF </p><p>HUE AND OTHER CATHOLICS HAVE INDICATED PRIVATELY TO </p><p>EMBOFFS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS THAT </p><p>FATHER LY WAS GOING TOO FAR AND PUSHING TOO HARD FOR </p><p>CHANGE IN WAYS THEY BELIEVED UNHELPFUL TO THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>FUTURE HERE.  PROBABLY A LARGE MAJORITY OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>TODAY ARE PLEASED WITH THE GREATER PERSONAL LIBERTIES </p><p>COMPARED WITH ONLY A DECADE AGO, AND WORRY MORE ABOUT </p><p>THEIR ECONOMIC WELL-BEING THAN THEY DO ABOUT EXPANDING </p><p>THE SPHERE OF POLITICAL AND OTHER FREEDOMS.  THE GVN </p><p>WILL HAVE ITS EYE ON FATHER LY\'S LOCAL SUPPORTERS, WHO </p><p>MIGHT CONCEIVABLY WISH TO PROTEST, AND AUTHORITIES WILL </p><p>DEAL FIRMLY WITH ANY NASCENT SIGNS OF DISSATISFACTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE SEVERITY OF THE SENTENCE CLEARLY REFLECTS </p><p>THE HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY THIS YEAR -- FOLLOWING THE </p><p>ETHNIC DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN </p><p>FEBRUARY -- TO PERCEIVED CHALLENGES TO THE AUTHORITY OF </p><p>THE GVN AND VCP.  IT ALSO MARKS OFFICIAL EXASPERATION </p><p>THAT FATHER LY DID NOT EVEN TO TRY TO PLAY BY THE RULES </p><p>DESIGNED TO "HELP" HIM TO REFORM, E.G., OBEY THE </p><p>GUIDELINES OF HIS "ADMINISTRATION PROBATION." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE COURT IN HUE IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE MADE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02789  02 OF 02  241033Z </p><p>THIS DECISION IN A VACUUM;  THE SENTENCE PROBABLY </p><p>REFLECTS A CONSENSUS WITHIN SENIOR LEVELS OF THE GVN </p><p>AND VCP.  IT WAS MEANT TO SEND A MESSAGE, PROBABLY NOT </p><p>TO THE U.S. BUT TO WOULD-BE ACTIVISTS AND REFORMERS IN </p><p>VIETNAM, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN AND AROUND HUE WHO KNOW </p><p>AND MIGHT SUPPORT FATHER LY.  THAT IS WHY THE NEWS </p><p>ABOUT FATHER LY\'S SENTENCE WAS BROADLY CARRIED IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL MEDIA, INCLUDING TELEVISION.  THE MESSAGE IS: </p><p>DO NOT CHALLENGE THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE AND PARTY, </p><p>AND ONLY ENGAGE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE AND </p><p>PARTY HAVE AUTHORIZED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.  THE CASE AND </p><p>TRIAL LIKELY PROCEEDED AT THEIR OWN PACE AS LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES PREPARED AND PRESENTED THE CASE AGAINST </p><p>HIM;  THE TIMING PROBABLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE </p><p>RECENT U.S. RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT OR ONGOING SENATE CONSIDERATION OF THE VHRA. </p><p>BUT PASSAGE OF THE VHRA WOULD FURTHER RAISE VIETNAM\'S </p><p>IRE AGAINST PERCEIVED US INTERFERENCE AND MAKE THE GVN </p><p>MORE, NOT LESS, LIKELY TO REACT HARSHLY TO NEW </p><p>PERCEIVED THREATS TO ITS AUTHORITY AT HOME. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A </p><p>CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE USG, CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. </p><p>COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SHOWING </p><p>OUR CLEAR-CUT OPPOSITION TO THIS SENTENCE, OUR </p><p>CONVICTION THAT FATHER LY AND ALL VIETNAMESE CITIZENS </p><p>SHOULD HAVE GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS AND OTHER </p><p>LIBERTIES INCLUDING FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION AND SPEECH, </p><p>AND OUR CALL FOR HIS RELEASE.  SUCH A MESSAGE WILL NOT </p><p>BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT IT MIGHT AT LEAST FORCE AUTHORITIES </p><p>TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN THEIR CARE OF FATHER LY IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02789  02 OF 02  241033Z </p><p>PRISON, A SMALL VICTORY.  VIETNAM WILL NOT WANT ITS OWN </p><p>PEOPLE, MUCH LESS THE USG, TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAVED IN </p><p>TO FOREIGN PRESSURE ON THIS CASE.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>FATHER LY IS LIKELY TO REMAIN IN PRISON FOR THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  PERHAPS HIS BEST HOPE FOR EARLY </p><p>RELEASE MIGHT BE ON MEDICAL GROUNDS, SINCE EVEN THE GVN </p><p>WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN HIS DEATH IN PRISON. </p><p>HOWEVER, MOST RECENT ACCOUNTS HAVE INDICATED THAT HE </p><p>WAS IN GOOD HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  EMBASSY WOULD WELCOME A VISIT SOON BY THE </p><p>U.S. COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS </p><p>AN EXCELLENT MEANS TO MAKING SURE THAT THE GVN BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THE US COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM IN VIETNAM AND ELSEWHERE.   CHANCES OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE WILLINGNESS TO AGREE TO SUCH A VISIT ARE </p><p>SLIM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF THE 2001 </p><p>REPORT, HOWEVER.  EMBASSY NONETHELESS BELIEVES IT WOULD </p><p>BE WORTHWHILE TO MAKE THE REQUEST AND PURSUE IT </p><p>VIGOROUSLY HERE AND IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
