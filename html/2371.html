U.S. MERCHANDISE EXPORTS TO ZIMBABWE IN </p><p>2000 TOTALED $53 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $7 MILLION </p><p>FROM 1999. ZIMBABWE WAS THE UNITED STATES\' 134TH </p><p>LARGEST EXPORT MARKET IN 2000.

HOWEVER WE </p><p>POINT OUT THAT ZIMBABWE\'S RECENT, SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS WOULD LIKELY MAKE THE MARKET VALUE MUCH </p><p>LOWER, AND HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGES AND THE EXISTENCE </p><p>OP BOTH OPPICIAL AND PARALLEL FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS </p><p>COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTY AND POSSIBLE FURTHER </p><p>DEVALUATION OF ANY REPATRIATED INVESTMENT VALUES. </p><p> </p><p>IMPORT POLICIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00081  01 OF 06  091619Z </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY, INCLUDING ITS TARIFF REGIME, BEGAN </p><p>A TRANSITION IN 1991 FROM A HIGHLY CONTROLLED, </p><p>MARXIST-MODELED, STATIST SYSTEM TO A MORE OPEN, </p><p>MARKET-BASED ECONOMIC SYSTEM. DURING THE FIRST PHASE </p><p>OF ITS STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM, WHICH ENDED IN </p><p>1995, ZIMBABWE ABOLISHED QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS IN </p><p>FAVOR OF A TARIFF-BASED TRADING SYSTEM. IN EARLY 1996, </p><p>ZIMBABWE UNDERTOOK A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND </p><p>RATIONALIZATION OF ITS TARIFF POLICIES AND RATES WITH </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL WORLD BANK INPUT AND THE COOPERATION OF </p><p>THE CONFEDERATION OF ZIMBABWE INDUSTRIES (CZI). A NEW </p><p>TARIFF REGIME, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 1997, LOWERED DUTIES </p><p>ON RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER INPUTS IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>REMOVE MOST CASES OF THE PREVIOUS ANOMALY WHERE THERE </p><p>WERE HIGHER DUTIES ON RAW MATERIALS THAN ON FINISHED </p><p>PRODUCTS. RAW MATERIALS NOW INCUR A DUTY RATE OF FIVE </p><p>TO 15 PERCENT, THOUGH ADDITIONAL IMPORT SURCHARGES ARE </p><p>VERY LIKELY TO BE APPLIED. </p><p> </p><p>PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CURRENT BARRIER TO NEW </p><p>OR ONGOING TRADE OR IMPORTS TO ZIMBABWE IS THE VERY </p><p>POOR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SITUATION, AND THE RESULTANT </p><p>SEVERE HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE. THE CAUSES ARE MYRIAD: </p><p>DECLINING GDP (IN REAL TERMS); HIGH INFLATION (THAT </p><p>HAS RECENTLY EXCEEDED 100 PERCENT); AN OVERVALUED </p><p>PEGGED CURRENCY; AN UNSUSTAINABLY HIGH GOVERNMENT </p><p>BUDGET DEFICIT (ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF </p><p>GDP FOR 2000, AND 15 PERCENT FOR 2001); OVERALL POOR </p><p>EXPORT AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE THAT IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO WORSEN; THREATS TO THE COUNTRY\'S CORE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00081  01 OF 06  091619Z </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR; CONTINUED AND SPREADING </p><p>CORRUPTION; AND CONTINUED FUEL AND OTHER KEY INPUT </p><p>SHORTAGES (CAUSED BY THE LACK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY). </p><p>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DETERIORATE </p><p>FURTHER BEFORE THEY IMPROVE, AND A TURNAROUND WOULD </p><p>LIKELY NEED TO BE PROCEEDED BY A RESUMPTION OF </p><p>POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DONOR AND MULTILATERAL LENDING COMMUNITY. </p><p>TARIFFS AND DUTIES </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY AND AS A PRECURSOR TO THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF A VALUE-ADDED-TAX (VAT) REGIME, WHICH </p><p>HAS BEEN DELAYED FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS AND THE TIMING </p><p>OF WHICH IS STILL UNCERTAIN, THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FINALIZING A NEW TARIFF </p><p>AND IMPORT DUTY SCHEDULE.
