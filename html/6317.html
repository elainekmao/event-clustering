<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001531 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, March 13, </p><p>continue to focus on Iraq developments, in particular </p><p>reports of a new British "6-point plan" to disarm Iraq </p><p>and avoid war. </p><p> </p><p>                Editorial Commentaries </p><p> </p><p>-- "The American mother of all bombs" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Mohammad Amayreh writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/13):  "A weird discrepancy and strange </p><p>contradiction exists in the world, because those who </p><p>actually own the lethal and genuine weapons of mass </p><p>destruction are coming to Iraq to disarm it of weapons </p><p>they claim have mass destruction capabilities..  They </p><p>want us to believe that their upcoming `picnic\' is in </p><p>our best interest, to defend people, to set new rules </p><p>for democracy, freedom, justice and human rights, and </p><p>to relieve the Iraqi people of the rule of Saddam </p><p>Hussein.  They want us to believe that the `thief\' is </p><p>the `protector\'.  If they are really concerned, then </p><p>where is their stand towards the Palestinian people? </p><p>Why do they ignore Sharon\'s daily crimes and allow him </p><p>to do whatever he wants with this unarmed people? </p><p>What happened to their promises of resolving the </p><p>Palestinian issue?  In fact, where is the `roadmap\' </p><p>that they set up, and why are they not here protecting </p><p>the Palestinian people?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "We do not hate anyone, but." </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/13):  "In dialogues and discussions about the </p><p>Arabs and the West, the Arab interlocutor always ends </p><p>up with the sudden question: why do you hate us?  This </p><p>issue does not require dialogues or seminars.  The </p><p>facts on the ground prove the aggressiveness, even </p><p>brutality, of the other [the West] towards us.  It is </p><p>not a matter of love or hate, but a defense of the </p><p>self, of existence and being.  When the United States </p><p>stands with all its might in support of Israel, and </p><p>rallies its armies and fleets to strike Iraq, while </p><p>Bush describes this strike as indispensable because it </p><p>stops Iraq from threatening Israel, then it is not </p><p>about love or hate.  It is about resisting or </p><p>surrendering." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraqi opposition or American colonization?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/13):  "Are we eventually going to end up </p><p>contemplating that it might be better for Iraq\'s </p><p>territorial unity and peace among the Iraqis if there </p><p>is an American governor, not an Iraqi one, in place in </p><p>the initial stages that follow the regime change?  It </p><p>is a regretful question with a regretful answer, </p><p>particularly if we take into consideration the welfare </p><p>of the Iraqi people, their security and their life and </p><p>Iraq\'s unity.  We are not going to get carried away in </p><p>thinking about issues after the war, because the main </p><p>idea here is to prevent the war itself.  However, </p><p>seeing the Iraqi opposition makes us afraid of what </p><p>these ill-intentioned people who are filled with a </p><p>spirit of hate and vengeance might do.  The people of </p><p>Iraq, of course, deserve a better future, but the </p><p>Iraqi opposition, with its current formation cannot be </p><p>the right replacement..  It is a moral disaster for us </p><p>to reach a stage where we think that a temporary </p><p>American military administration would be better for </p><p>the Iraqi people than the complications of the </p><p>opposition or the desires of Arab and Muslim </p><p>neighboring countries.  We say this regretfully but </p><p>also candidly and frankly." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
