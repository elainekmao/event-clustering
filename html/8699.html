<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001034 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-13-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Reports continue to flow in linking the Tigers </p><p>to violence against Tamil opponents </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1029 (Notal), and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Reports continue to flow in linking </p><p>the Tigers to violence against Tamil opponents.  In </p><p>addition to over 20 killings in recent months, the </p><p>latest incidents involve the slayings of two Tamils in </p><p>the east.  The GSL is having problems proving Tiger </p><p>involvement, though it may have garnered a break when it </p><p>captured two suspected Tigers this week.  The killings </p><p>have contributed to a growing sense of unease about the </p><p>Tigers.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MORE KILLINGS:  Reports continue to flow in </p><p>linking the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>organization to violence against Tamil opponents.  The </p><p>latest incidents include the slayings of two anti-LTTE </p><p>Tamils in Sri Lanka\'s Eastern Province.  In the first </p><p>incident, a former member of the Eelam People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (EPDP) was shot and killed on June 7 </p><p>outside of Trincomalee town.  In the second incident, a </p><p>former member of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization </p><p>(TELO) and his young child were killed in a hand grenade </p><p>explosion on June 6 near Batticaloa town. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) These latest killings come on top of those of </p><p>about 20 anti-LTTE Tamils since the start of the year </p><p>(see Reftels).  The victims have been divided into two </p><p>broad categories:  (1) Members or former activists of </p><p>anti-LTTE parties (such as the victims in the two most </p><p>recent killings); and, (2) Tamils who work or formerly </p><p>worked as informants for Sri Lanka\'s military. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PROVING LTTE INVOLVEMENT DIFFICULT:  As with </p><p>virtually all of the previous killings, no one has been </p><p>arrested in the latest incidents.  The wave of attacks </p><p>have been extremely well-planned with the perpetrators </p><p>often driving quickly away in vehicles and melting away </p><p>after that.  Contacts in the government and other </p><p>observers, however, universally believe that the LTTE is </p><p>to blame.  In a June 12 conversation, for example, </p><p>Taranjit Sandhu, Indian High Commission polchief, told </p><p>us that the incidents have all the hallmarks of LTTE </p><p>targeted assassinations.  Sandhu also noted the obvious </p><p>fact that those who have been killed are or were anti- </p><p>LTTE activists, making the Tigers the party that would </p><p>feel it had the most to gain by employing such terror </p><p>tactics.  Sandhu went on to note unconfirmed reports </p><p>circulating in the north and east that LTTE leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran has actually issued written instructions for </p><p>anti-Tiger Tamils to be killed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For its part, the LTTE has denied it is involved </p><p>in the killings.  These claims have been echoed by pro- </p><p>Tiger politicians.  In a recent meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, for example, Kumar Ponnambalam, a MP for the </p><p>Tamil National Alliance with close LTTE associations, </p><p>was adamant that there was absolutely no evidence </p><p>linking the LTTE to the crimes. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A BREAK?:  The GSL might have garnered a break </p><p>in their efforts to prove the Tigers\' involvement in the </p><p>killings.  As first reported in Reftels, two suspected </p><p>LTTE cadre were stopped during a random police check in </p><p>central Colombo on the evening of June 10.  The two men </p><p>who were armed tried to run away, but were captured, with </p><p>one of them swallowing a cyanide tablet.  The two men are </p><p>now in custody, with the one who took cyanide in critical </p><p>condition in a hospital.  Government officials have told </p><p>us that they believe that the two suspected cadre were </p><p>apparently on their way to try to assassinate a Tamil </p><p>informant for the military when they were intercepted. </p><p>At this point, interrogation of the one healthy suspect </p><p>is continuing, with the government relatively sure that </p><p>it has netted its first big breakthrough regarding the </p><p>recent spate of killings. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  Shortly after the two suspects were </p><p>captured on June 10, two policemen were captured by the </p><p>LTTE in the Trincomalee area.  The LTTE has announced </p><p>that it is holding the two policemen captive until the </p><p>GSL releases a LTTE cadre who is now in jail.  There was </p><p>some initial speculation that the LTTE might be holding </p><p>the two policemen in exchange for the LTTE suspects </p><p>arrested in Colombo, but this has not yet panned out. </p><p>The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission is looking into the </p><p>matter and is trying to arrange a meeting with the LTTE </p><p>to discuss it.))) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  While the government tries to catch </p><p>the perpetrators of the killings, there is little doubt </p><p>that the LTTE is the culprit.  As noted, the attacks </p><p>have all the hallmarks of LTTE operations, including -- </p><p>as with the June 10 incident -- the use of cyanide by an </p><p>operative who is captured.  In addition to the LTTE\'s </p><p>increasingly shrill communications turning down offers </p><p>to restart the peace talks, the recent killings have </p><p>contributed mightily to a growing sense of unease about </p><p>the Tigers and their intentions.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
