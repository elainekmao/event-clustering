(S)  The sharp and angry public reaction to the start of </p><p>war in Iraq has forced King Abdullah and the GOJ to alter </p><p>their public line to deal with the public ire.  In a speech </p><p>by King Abdullah on March 21, a press conference the next day </p><p>with the PM, FonMin and InfoMin, and official news agency </p><p>reports of cabinet and other meetings, the GOJ is trying to </p><p>create the impression that it is working to end the war in </p><p>Iraq.   PM Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador March 24 that GOJ </p><p>officials will have to say things the U.S. does not like to </p><p>address public anger, but will choose their words carefully. </p><p>The King has decided that he needs to be seen as working to </p><p>end hostilities, although he has backed off slightly from an </p><p>announced new diplomatic initiative, including a planned </p><p>phone call to President Bush.  Despite the public pressure, </p><p>the GOJ has continued its support to coalition forces, has </p><p>frozen Iraqi government assets, and has expelled Iraqi </p><p>intelligence officers.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ANGRY PUBLIC REACTION RATTLES GOJ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The enraged Jordanian public reaction to the </p><p>beginning of hostilities in Iraq (refs a and b and septel) </p><p>has caused senior GOJ officials to rethink their public </p><p>strategy.  Our security liaison contacts have expressed </p><p>concern over the mounting level of anti-U.S. feeling the war </p><p>has engendered, and do not want those emotions projected onto </p><p>the King or government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The King, Prime Minister Abul Ragheb, other senior </p><p>officials, and the official Petra news agency have </p><p>consequently focused their statements on expressions of </p><p>opposition to hostilities (in almost exclusively humanitarian </p><p>terms) and sympathy with the Iraqi people.  The King in his </p><p>March 21 speech to the nation (ref c) called for calm in </p><p>Jordan, and tried to focus attention on what Jordan can do </p><p>for the future of Iraqis.  In a joint press conference March </p><p>23 with Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher and Information </p><p>Minister Mohammad Adwan, the Prime Minister announced the </p><p>GOJ\'s opposition to the war, as well as a new Jordanian </p><p>diplomatic initiative to end it (refs d and e).  The King was </p><p>quoted as telling a cabinet meeting on March 23 that "we must </p><p>work to stop the war against Iraq quickly," and denying that </p><p>coalition aircraft were using Jordanian airspace to attack </p><p>Iraq (ref f).  The King reiterated the no-overflight </p><p>statement to members of the Senate March 24, and said </p><p>Jordanian territory would not be used to convey troops into </p><p>Iraq that were to have gone through Turkey (ref g). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PM:  WE\'LL HAVE TO SAY THINGS YOU WON\'T LIKE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  PM Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador March 24 that he </p><p>had carefully chosen his words during the March 23 news </p><p>conference, noting that he had not used "words like killing, </p><p>aggression, bombing," but instead had spoken of "military </p><p>action" and the need to work to "save people\'s lives."  That </p><p>said, "we need to show our people we are really doing </p><p>something" to end the war.  Hence, Jordan was launching a new </p><p>diplomatic offensive "to find a resolution acceptable to all </p><p>parties." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  He said that, long before the outbreak of war, he </p><p>had told the Ambassador that the GOJ "would have to say </p><p>things you won\'t like."  Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, </p><p>Abul Ragheb said, had also made this point to Secretary </p><p>Powell in their recent phone conversation.  The bottom line, </p><p>the PM emphasized, is that Jordanians see pictures of people </p><p>getting killed in Iraq in a war they do not support, and they </p><p>are angry.  The GOJ is taking steps to keep the level of </p><p>public protest down, and he planned to meet with opposition </p><p>party leaders in the next few days to reiterate that the GOJ </p><p>will permit pre-approved rallies, but will crack down on </p><p>un-approved protests or the use of violence. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  The Ambassador pushed back, saying that, now that </p><p>the war has begun, it is clear that Saddam Hussein and his </p><p>regime are finished.  Jordan would have to consider the </p><p>effect of its statements now on a post-Saddam government in </p><p>Baghdad, and on the U.S.  Backpedaling somewhat, Abul Ragheb </p><p>responded that the GOJ has "determined that this will not be </p><p>like 1991." </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POSITIVE NEWS AS WELL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  Despite the increasingly anti-war public </p><p>statements, the GOJ continues to take more quiet steps to </p><p>support the coalition.  The GOJ has continued its previously </p><p>agreed military support to coalition forces (with a few minor </p><p>hiccups).  Jordan has frozen the assets of the Iraqi </p><p>government in Jordan (ref h).  It has also expelled several </p><p>Iraqi intelligence officers operating under diplomatic and </p><p>non-official cover, although there is now some question about </p><p>who and how many Iraqis have been kicked out.  The GOJ has </p><p>also been helped by the lack of an economic crisis associated </p><p>with the war in Iraq.  There has been no capital flight, </p><p>there are adequate stocks of food and fuel, the Amman stock </p><p>exchange has remained stable, and three European air carriers </p><p>have resumed earlier suspended flights into Amman. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  The King has told the Ambassador and senior USG </p><p>officials several times that he believed the "tipping point" </p><p>for the Jordanian public\'s reaction to war in Iraq would be </p><p>scenes on al-Jazeera TV of jubilant Iraqis celebrating their </p><p>liberation from Saddam Hussein.  The King expected this in </p><p>the early days of the war, and the lack of such scenes has </p><p>made him feel exposed.  Iraqi VP Taha Yassin Ramadan\'s </p><p>ranting March 25 press conference attack on Jordan\'s support </p><p>for the coalition has heightened anxiety. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  Given his political exposure, the King has moved to </p><p>distance himself personally and the GOJ in general from </p><p>military action, and has considered launching a series of </p><p>phone calls to P-5 leaders and UN Secretary General Annan </p><p>(although he rethought his planned March 25 call to the </p><p>President).  He wants to be able to tell his people that he </p><p>is actively engaged in finding an end to the war, even if he </p><p>is powerless to stop it.  The Foreign Minister has stressed, </p><p>however, that the King is determined to do nothing that </p><p>undercuts the President\'s decision to topple Saddam Hussein. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
