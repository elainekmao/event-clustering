The DART is expecting the delivery of relief supplies to </p><p>the warehouse in Kuwait within the week.  On 23 March, a WFP </p><p>plane arrived at Kuwait International Airport with 40 MT of </p><p>high-energy biscuits, and on 24 March, two shipments of </p><p>wheat donated by the Australian Government departed Muscat </p><p>en route to the Port of Umm Qasr, where they will dock when </p><p>the port is deemed secure.  The DART plans to conduct a </p><p>reconnaissance mission to assess port security supported by </p><p>Civil Affairs (CA).  On 24 March, two CA liaison officers </p><p>joined the DART to assist in connecting DART staff with </p><p>forward operational units and facilitate information </p><p>sharing.  The Health Fusion Cell has been assembled to </p><p>discuss relief, reconstruction, and the planning for support </p><p>to the post-regime Iraqi Ministry of Health.  Approximately </p><p>5,000 people crossed into Kurdish held areas in the North </p><p>during March, but there have been few if any crossings since </p><p>the Iraqis closed and mined the border.  On 24 March, DART </p><p>Abuse Prevention Officers met with CA officers assigned to </p><p>the DART, who will facilitate APU communication with CA </p><p>battalions in the field.  Also on 24 March, DART OTI staff </p><p>briefed ORHA coordinators and on the proposed procedure for </p><p>the local grant program.  During the 23 March HOC briefing, </p><p>significant informal information was passed to UNSECOORD to </p><p>help with the accurate assessment the operational security </p><p>posture in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On March 24, the first DART/USAID Iraq joint </p><p>collaboration meeting was held.  Between 19 and 23 March, a </p><p>USAID Reconstruction Team representative and military </p><p>officials in Doha held a coordination meeting to plan </p><p>subsequent USCENTCOM movements.  On 24 March, PAOs from DART </p><p>and USAID mission met with the OHRA Public Affairs team in </p><p>preparation for media coverage of the OHRA Director\'s entry </p><p>into Baghdad.  USAID Mission will brief ORHA, CFLCC, and </p><p>USCENTCOM on USAID policies and procedures for field </p><p>operations including procurement and contract management. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>LOGISTICS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Over the next week, seventeen 40-foot containers of </p><p>relief supplies are scheduled to be delivered to the DART </p><p>warehouse in Kuwait.  Cargo in the containers consists of </p><p>hygiene kits, plastic sheeting, and wool blankets. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  On 23 March, a World Food Program (WFP) plane arrived at </p><p>Kuwait International Airport with 40 Metric Tons (MT) of </p><p>high-energy biscuits.  This arrival marked the second of </p><p>four planes that will carry a total of 160 MT of food, </p><p>enough to feed 50,000 beneficiaries for three months.  These </p><p>commodities will be targeted for emergency supplemental </p><p>feeding countrywide in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  On 24 March, two shipments of wheat donated by the </p><p>Australian Government departed Muscat.  The shipments are </p><p>expected to arrive at the Port of Umm Qasr when it is deemed </p><p>secure.  However, there are no milling facilities at the </p><p>port.  The closest are in and around Basra.  If the mills in </p><p>Basra are operational, they could be used once trucking </p><p>becomes available.  In the interim, the wheat could be </p><p>stored in a silo or distributed whole.  The issue of </p><p>financing the associated costs beyond shipping has yet to be </p><p>resolved.  DART is planning a reconnaissance mission to the </p><p>port in the coming days. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Health Fusion Cell, comprised of the DART Health </p><p>Team, Civil Affairs health and public health units, USAID </p><p>Reconstruction Team, and other donors, has been assembled to </p><p>discuss relief, reconstruction, and the planning for support </p><p>to the post-regime Iraqi Ministry of Health.  Members of the </p><p>Health Fusion Cell are meeting daily with NGOs to discuss </p><p>assessments, capabilities, and planning. The second meeting </p><p>was held on 24 March, and included observers from the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross and representatives </p><p>from the Iraqi Refugee Aid Council and their and partner the </p><p>American Refugee Committee, the International Medical Corps, </p><p>Samaritan\'s Purse, Mercy Corps International (MCI), the </p><p>International Development and Relief Board, and Physicians </p><p>for Human Rights.  The DART Health Team discussed the </p><p>availability of, and anticipated need for, further </p><p>assessments in health and the capabilities of the DART Rapid </p><p>Assessment form.  The DART anticipates the application of </p><p>the rapid assessment forms once the security situation </p><p>allows entrance into the southern region.  The DART is </p><p>currently receiving proposals for emergency health </p><p>interventions. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>POPULATION DISPLACEMENTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  On 24 March, Team North received a briefing from MCI on </p><p>the situation in northern Iraq.  According to MCI, people </p><p>are returning home, and the shops are open.  However, the </p><p>general feeling is that the situation remains volatile. </p><p>Despite recent media reports of 400,000 internally displaced </p><p>persons in northern Iraq, Team North reported that 5,000 </p><p>people crossed into Kurdish-held areas in the North during </p><p>March.  There have been no reports of refugees crossing into </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT (APU) </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  On 24 March, DART Abuse Prevention Officers met with CA </p><p>officers assigned to the DART, who will facilitate APU </p><p>communication with CA battalions in the field.  The APU also </p><p>plans to brief all new CA arrivals and will distribute the </p><p>Abuse Prevention Field Guide to all CA battalions that are </p><p>already forward. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES (OTI) </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  On 24 March, DART OTI staff briefed the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) </p><p>coordinators on the proposed procedure for the local grant </p><p>program, which was well received and matched closely with </p><p>ORHA plans for quick impact grants.  On 25 March, the DART </p><p>OTI team will meet with USAID Reconstruction staff to </p><p>examine possibility of DART OTI assistance to the USAID </p><p>mission in initiating early water and sanitation activities </p><p>at the community level until the USAID contractor is </p><p>mobilized. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OPERATION CENTER (HOC) </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Approximately 60 people attended the HOC briefing on 22 </p><p>March.  During the briefing, significant informal </p><p>information was passed to United Nations Security </p><p>Coordinator (UNSECOORD) to help them accurately assess the </p><p>operational security posture in Kuwait.  On 22 March, </p><p>journalists were allowed into Umm Qasr under heavy military </p><p>escort and protection.  Graphics and geographic coordinates </p><p>of seven burning oil wells were briefed.  Civil Affairs </p><p>teams are assessing the burning wells and arranging for </p><p>contractors to extinguish them.  Dark clouds of smoke </p><p>obscure the Kuwait City skyline when the winds are calm. </p><p>The HOC and the International Council of Voluntary Agencies </p><p>are setting up a schedule to provide personal nuclear, </p><p>biological, and chemical protection training to those </p><p>interested. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MILITARY LIAISON UNIT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 24 March, the first meeting at the Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance Coordination Center (HACC) was held.  A main </p><p>topic of discussion was the security assessment trip to Umm </p><p>Qasr.  The Civil Affairs (CA) personnel have been very </p><p>supportive of the DART\'s attempts to move forward to assess </p><p>the port.  During the meeting, it was requested that the </p><p>HACC work with the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) command </p><p>and the HOC to develop a protocol for the passage and </p><p>coordination of IO/NGO/UN personnel in the I MEF AOR. </p><p>However, as there do not seem to be large numbers of </p><p>displaced persons at this time, the need for a humanitarian </p><p>response appears minimal at present.  However, there are </p><p>significant security considerations that need attention. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Also on 24 March, two CA liaison officers temporarily </p><p>joined the DART.  They will assist in connecting DART staff </p><p>with forward operational units and facilitate the </p><p>information collected by forward CA teams using the new </p><p>United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian </p><p>Affairs (UN OCHA) rapid assessment forms.  The CA liaison </p><p>officers will facilitate operational activities when DART </p><p>staff move into Iraq to begin needs-based assessments. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>USAID - RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The head of the USAID Reconstruction Team and the DART </p><p>Team Leader convened the first DART/USAID Iraq joint </p><p>collaboration meeting on 24 March to discuss mutual program </p><p>priorities, introduce new staff, requirement for, and </p><p>coordination of, reporting to Washington, press guidance, </p><p>assessment sharing, and other matters of joint concern. </p><p>Between 19 to 23 March, a USAID representative and military </p><p>officials in Doha held a coordination meeting to plan </p><p>subsequent USCENTCOM movements. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Between 19 and 23 March, a USAID Reconstruction Team </p><p>representative and military officials in Doha held a </p><p>coordination meeting to plan subsequent U.S. Central Command </p><p>(USCENTCOM) movements.  The USAID Reconstruction Team also </p><p>plans Mission personnel to meet with elements of Coalition </p><p>Forces Land Component Command(CFLCC) to explain USAID </p><p>program processes including contracting, administration, and </p><p>other functions. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Plans are being made within ORHA for the eventual move </p><p>of ORHA elements, including reconstruction, to Baghdad. </p><p>Current plans call for a phased move of 20 reconstruction </p><p>people, followed by approximately 30 others. </p><p> </p><p>15.  On 24 March, Public Affairs Officers (PAOs) from DART </p><p>and USAID mission met with the OHRA Public Affairs team to </p><p>begin planning for a media event featuring OHRA Director </p><p>Garner on his entry into Baghdad.  The focus of the meeting </p><p>was to define message content, event profile, and </p><p>prospective audiences. </p><p> </p><p>16.  USAID Mission will brief ORHA, CFLCC, and USCENTCOM on </p><p>USAID policies and procedures for field operations including </p><p>procurement and contract management.  USAID Mission, ORHA, </p><p>USCENTCOM, and CFLCC will also hold a two-day planning </p><p>meeting this week to ensure coordination on meeting </p><p>reconstruction goals.  Additionally, USAID Mission, ORHA, </p><p>CFLCC, and ORHA (HA) will meet to establish USAID </p><p>requirements for the establishment of a HOC-like office in </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
