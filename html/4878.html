<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 003463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, ALSO FOR D/HS, HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y  (PARA 2 LAST WORD) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CVIS, PREL, PGOV, APER, KCRM, SNAR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ESTABLISHMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WORKING GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 263389 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Per reftel, Post has established a Homeland </p><p>Security Working Group (HSWG) in order to focus on and </p><p>support "homeland security abroad" in Honduras.  Post will </p><p>incorporate its HSWG responsibilities into the existing work </p><p>of its Counternarcotics/Law Enforcement Committee (CNLE). </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Per reftel, Post determined it appropriate to </p><p>establish its HSWG by way of assigning the new homeland </p><p>security duties and responsibilities into the existing work </p><p>of its Counternarcotics/Law Enforcement Committee.  Post\'s </p><p>CNLE meets biweekly and is comprised of representatives from </p><p>the Political, Consular, Economic and Public Affairs </p><p>Sections, as well as RSO, DEA, TAT, INS, DAO, MILGP, </p><p>JTF-Bravo, ICITAP and ORCA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The CNLE Committee deals with a variety of </p><p>counternarcotics, law enforcement and security issues in </p><p>addition to counterterrorism matters.  Additionally, the CNLE </p><p>addresses customs, container, and port security, maritime </p><p>operations and immigration and visa Viper issues.  A chief </p><p>focus of the CNLE has been the growing nexus of </p><p>drugs-for-arms deals between drug traffickers and Colombian </p><p>terrorist groups that are taking place in Honduras.  The </p><p>functions of the existing CNLE fit hand-in-glove with HSWG </p><p>responsibilities.  The representatives who participate on the </p><p>CNLE are the same individuals who would coordinate HSWG </p><p>functions.  Therefore, Post has determined that the CNLE </p><p>Committee will become the CNLE/HSWG Committee. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
