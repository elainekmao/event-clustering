(U) Lula\'s crucial pension-reform bill was approved by the </p><p>Chamber of Deputies special committee on July 23 -- but only </p><p>after undergoing political buffets and a perhaps fateful </p><p>overhaul.  In a fundamental about-face, the GoB has accepted </p><p>that all current public-sector employees will remain eligible </p><p>for pensions equal to their top salary (albeit with big </p><p>improvements in minimum-age and time-worked eligibility </p><p>criteria.)  Chief factor behind this concession was shameless </p><p>lobbying by Brazil\'s judiciary, which enjoys unique pension </p><p>benefits and will ultimately decide any reform\'s </p><p>constitutionality.  There was also pressure from the GoB\'s </p><p>base in Congress with its long ties to public-sector unions. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Fiscally, the GoB claims the overall impact of its </p><p>shift is negligible.  Federal savings over the next twenty </p><p>years will still total 50.7 billion, vs. 52.4 billion under </p><p>the GoB\'s original proposals, supposedly.  `The market\' seems </p><p>to take these numbers at face value, and has been placid. </p><p>Politically, however, these early pension-bill concessions </p><p>have seemed to pose doubts over the goals and resolve of </p><p>Lula\'s team.  They may have opened the door to a snowball of </p><p>public clamor, brinkmanship, and further changes that will </p><p>gut the reform.  Lula\'s tax-reform bill, due for a committee </p><p>vote soon, could get trapped in a similar cycle.  He and his </p><p>team undoubtedly sense the danger and now are drumming the </p><p>message that they have gone to the limit of their pension- </p><p>reform horse-trading.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A Fortnight\'s Commotion in Review </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The GoB\'s about-face began on July 9, following </p><p>drawn-out dialogue with new Supreme Court Chief Justice </p><p>Correa.  The latter evidently sees his job as embracing the </p><p>duty to lobby for retention of the judiciary\'s uniquely </p><p>generous pension privileges, of which "integral" (100% of </p><p>final salary) pensions are the capstone.  The GoB in turn has </p><p>to bear in mind that the Supreme Court can torpedo any </p><p>pension reform by ruling it unconstitutional, as happened </p><p>with Cardoso\'s 1998 proposal to tax pensions.  Correa, Social- </p><p>Security Minister Berzoini, and lower-House Speaker Cunha, </p><p>with Planalto\'s Dirceu in the wings, conferred secretively </p><p>for two weeks.  Outcome:  while Lula was in Europe, on July </p><p>10 local press headlined the administration\'s alleged </p><p>surrender on the principle of "integral" pensions, not just </p><p>for the judiciary but for the whole current public sector. </p><p>Whether future public-sector workers, too, would get integral </p><p>pensions was not made explicit. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The news triggered consternation from media, Brazil\'s </p><p>governors, and Finance Minister Palocci.  Former Social- </p><p>Security Minister Brant, who now heads the Chamber of </p><p>Deputies\' special committee on the subject, was widely quoted </p><p>as saying "the new reform is no reform."  Various PT </p><p>politicians in and out of Congress lamented having stuck </p><p>their necks out defending the GoB\'s original reform plan. </p><p>Palocci by all accounts had not been kept current on the </p><p>Cunha/Berzoini/Correa/Dirceu talks and wanted to cancel his </p><p>European trip to join Lula, in favor of staying home to fight </p><p>for the GoB\'s original reform guidelines. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) But the weightiest adverse reaction was from Brazil\'s </p><p>governors.  Fiscal pressure on their own state budgets from </p><p>the pension system is as acute as on the Union\'s; many can </p><p>afford to pay "integral" pensions even less.  Lula made a </p><p>point of forming and presenting his pension and tax reform </p><p>plans to Congress with the governors\' consensus in April. </p><p>That the GoB now appeared to have negotiated so great a </p><p>change in the pension-reform plan, leaving governors to learn </p><p>about it in the papers, sat very badly.  Key Minas Gerais and </p><p>Sao Paulo governors Neves and Alckmin voiced opposition in </p><p>careful but ominous tones.  Temporizing, Dirceu convened a </p><p>meeting July 16 with five representative governors, plus </p><p>Cunha and Berzoini.  At that meeting, Berzoini gave figures </p><p>purporting that the changes overall would be revenue-neutral </p><p>for states as well as the Federal Treasury.  Governors seem </p><p>to have warily gone along, but with the insistence that </p><p>future public workers be ineligible for "integral" pensions. </p><p> </p><p>Lula Decides </p><p>------------ </p><p>6. (U) Meanwhile, from Portugal, Lula asserted his authority </p><p>to arbitrate.  At the tense inter-ministerial meeting which </p><p>followed his return on Thursday July 17, according to an </p><p>account in last week\'s "Epoca" financial weekly, Lula </p><p>censured Berzoini and Cunha (but absolved Dirceu) for undue </p><p>"precipitousness" in their political negotiations.  Yet at </p><p>meeting\'s end, despite Palocci\'s and Communications advisor </p><p>Gushiken\'s arguments against, Lula gave his imprimatur to </p><p>Berzoini\'s advocacy of integral pensions.  Lula also endorsed </p><p>the continuation of "parity," i.e., that retirees\' pensions </p><p>increase by the same factor as current workers\' salaries. </p><p>However, he ruled out letting future public-sector workers be </p><p>eligible for integral pensions, and he reasserted the GoB\'s </p><p>tough original guidelines in some other key respects. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The next day, the bill\'s sponsor, Deputy Carlos </p><p>Pimental (PT-Ceara) presented its adjusted version.  Salient </p><p>features include the following. </p><p> </p><p>-- minimum conditions for integral pensions: (women) 55 years </p><p>old with 30 years of INSS contributions and 20 years in the </p><p>public sector, including 10 in present occupation ("cargo"); </p><p>(men) 60/35/20/10 years, respectively. </p><p> </p><p>-- for future public-sector employees, a monthly pension cap </p><p>of BRL 2,400, with the option of a complementary pension fund </p><p>contributed to by government (same as the initial GoB </p><p>proposal). </p><p> </p><p>-- pensions to be taxed at 11%, starting at the present </p><p>personal-income tax floor of 1,058 Reals/month.  The earlier </p><p>agreement had been for a floor of 2,400/month. </p><p> </p><p>-- salary and hence pension sub-ceilings for state and </p><p>municipal judiciary employees of 75% the salaries of Supreme </p><p>Court judges.  The Berzoini/Cunha agreement had been 90.25%. </p><p> </p><p>-- survivor\'s benefit (currently 100% of the pension without </p><p>limit) to remain 100% only up to 1,058 Reals/month, with a </p><p>30% discount on anything above that level. </p><p> </p><p>-- "parity" (cf. above) to be preserved for existing pensions </p><p>of current and currently-eligible pensioners, and for other </p><p>current public sector, but with definition of parity for the </p><p>latter category left to a future complementary law. </p><p> </p><p>GoB Spin, Market\'s Placidity </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) The acceptance of "integral" pensions represents an </p><p>abandonment of the GoB\'s original goal of early transition </p><p>towards a unified social-security system with an eventual </p><p>common ceiling for public- and private-sector pensions so as </p><p>to curtail the grossly inequitable privileges enjoyed by </p><p>Brazil\'s high-paid civil servants (Ref B).  Defenders see it </p><p>as a vital, if ugly, GoB compromise to gain legislative and </p><p>Supreme Court approval of a pension reform that will bring </p><p>Brazil at least the minimum fiscal benefits needed to keep </p><p>the markets sunny.  Grandfathering all current workers\' </p><p>benefits could save the final reform from judicial challenges </p><p>based on loose interpretation of the Constitutional principle </p><p>of "acquired rights" that cannot be withdrawn.  Politically, </p><p>the primary gain of the last fortnight\'s bargaining is that </p><p>the governors seem warily back on board.  In Congress, there </p><p>is grumbling that the GoB walked back too much at the </p><p>governors\' behest, but no sign of major mutiny. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Fiscally, the GoB claims its shift preserves the </p><p>reform\'s "spinal cord" by improving the pension system\'s mid- </p><p>to-long term financial viability.  The GoB\'s prime assertion </p><p>is that, thanks to the major increases in mimimum-age and </p><p>length-of-work requirements, federal savings will not be </p><p>meaningfully reduced by the extension of integral pensions. </p><p>Under the original design, those savings were supposed to </p><p>total 52.4 billion Reals through 2023.  With the changes, </p><p>they will be 50.7 billion.  (Note:  no methodology details </p><p>available; these figures refer to federal civil servants </p><p>only, excluding state and local public sectors, the military, </p><p>firemen, and others.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) For now, financial markets evidently take the GoB </p><p>case at face value.  Global-bank analyses we read all treat </p><p>the revised pension-reform bill as being acceptable, as does </p><p>the IMF, to judge from its indirect commentary.  The recent </p><p>uncertainties have had next to no effect on the exchange </p><p>rate, while Brazil\'s country risk resumed its decline in July </p><p>and is now at its lowest level since March 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Fiscally Okay, but Politically Damaging? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) Fair enough, perhaps, in a green-eyeshade way.  Yet </p><p>the risk of collateral political damage to Lula seems high. </p><p>There isn\'t even much assurance that the pension bill will </p><p>pass Congress in its new form.  By ceding so much when the </p><p>bill was at merely the second of seven legislative voting </p><p>stages, the government may appear to have encouraged every </p><p>interest group to stonewall for extra concessions.  The GoB\'s </p><p>intent to start taxing retirees\' pensions is the most obvious </p><p>likely target.  Raising the survivor\'s-benefit ceiling is </p><p>another.  State and municipal judiciary employees demand that </p><p>their salary sub-ceiling go back up to 90.25% of Supreme </p><p>Court Justices\', not the 75% demanded by the governors, and </p><p>have declared they will strike August 5-12. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) More generally, the back-and-forth over pensions </p><p>has let doubt be posed as to how clear, set and stable in its </p><p>reform course the GoB really is.  We believe such doubts are </p><p>misplaced.  But it is a fact that Lula\'s team has accepted a </p><p>succession of major alterations to the design that it </p><p>initially was adamant be taken as a whole.  And their </p><p>statements on pension issues - including Lula\'s own -- have </p><p>often contradicted or reversed themselves.  Hitherto, as a </p><p>veteran interlocutor recently put it to us, most of Brazil\'s </p><p>body politic seemed ready to board Lula\'s reform train, as </p><p>long as he was driving it and taking the heat.  Now, they can </p><p>feel there is a political premium, and no penalty, in </p><p>opposing his measures. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Most immediately, this could affect Lula\'s tax-reform </p><p>bill.  Since the pension-bill\'s re-working, governors have </p><p>been holding out for three compensatory alterations in the </p><p>GoB\'s tax-reform bill:  for states to share both the CPMF and </p><p>CIDE taxes (each of which currently accrues 100% to the </p><p>Union); for extra funds to compensate states for revenue </p><p>losses stemming from the federal Kandir Law (which exempts </p><p>exports from major taxes); and for lesser earmarking </p><p>requirements on transfers from the federal treasury.  If </p><p>pension and tax reform bog down in a cycle of demands and </p><p>concessions, Brazil\'s fiscal future and Lula\'s political </p><p>stature will both be hard-hit. </p><p> </p><p>Stiffened GoB Stance </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>14. (U) The GoB is well aware of these considerations.  Lula, </p><p>Berzoini and Dirceu as well as Palocci all are loudly warning </p><p>that the government has reached the limit of its concessions </p><p>vis-a-vis pension reform.  In a personal meeting, Lula told </p><p>the CUT (largest labor federation) leader that the GoB would </p><p>introduce no further changes to its proposals.  The </p><p>administration responded to the state judges\' strike threat </p><p>with a refusal to entertain any negotiations, and Lula in a </p><p>July 24 speech blasted their demands.  And in its strongest </p><p>show of renewed force, the administration on July 23 rammed </p><p>the reform bill through the Chamber\'s special committee </p><p>without further change by a 30-8 vote. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The bill must now pass two Chamber floor votes, of </p><p>which the first is expected in early August and the second </p><p>probably not before September, with 60% majorities (Ref A). </p><p>It would then go to the Senate\'s Justice Committee for a </p><p>ruling on constitutionality and thence to the Senate floor </p><p>for a further two votes, also requiring 60% majorities, the </p><p>second of which is not generally expected before January.  By </p><p>all media accounts, Lula and Planalto are determined to take </p><p>over direct management of the bills\' legislative advance. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Such signs of fresh resolve offer hope that Lula </p><p>and team have absorbed lessons from the latest rough-and- </p><p>tumble of the pension-reform process.  Should they hold their </p><p>re-configured line, the result will probably deserve to be </p><p>deemed a success.  But the prospect now looks more unsure. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
