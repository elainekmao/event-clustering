<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MAY 7: DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ; </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE; ARAB MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: A strong call for the end of the Arab League </p><p>appears on the commentary pages, citing the League\'s </p><p>repeated failures to solve Arab problems or maintain Arab </p><p>unity, most prominently during the Iraq crisis. Arab </p><p>satellite news channels are attacked for the negative tone </p><p>of their coverage of Iraq even after liberation, with one </p><p>writer stating, "Iraqis do not need others to sow sedition </p><p>among them." Another writer warns that a democratic Iraq </p><p>will lead some neighboring states to attempt to undermine </p><p>any new Iraqi government. A conservative commentator </p><p>portrays the presence of US troops in Iraq as a reflection </p><p>of an "American-Zionist ideology" of "occupation." END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Al-Qabas reports on its front page that </p><p>"a responsible Kuwaiti parliamentary source" says that the </p><p>U.S. has requested Kuwait drop its claims for reparations </p><p>from Iraq dating from the 1990-91 Gulf War. </p><p> </p><p>Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Khaled announced that a </p><p>Kuwaiti team left for Iraq on May 6 to search for Kuwaiti </p><p>POWs, Al-Qabas reports on its May 7 front page. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that Minister of Social Affairs and Labor </p><p>Al-Ayyar announced that a fund-raising campaign for Iraq </p><p>would be launched in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The Occupation" </p><p>Islamist MP Abdelmohsen Jamal wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(5/05):  "It seems that Sharon was successful in convincing </p><p>the US that the Arabs can only be dominated if their lands </p><p>are occupied one after another. Occupation has become an </p><p>American-Zionist ideology. and threatens every country that </p><p>does not comply with the American-Zionist demands." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Iraq and the Neighboring Countries" </p><p>MP Saleh Ashour wrote in independent Al-Watan (5/05): </p><p>"There are many indications that the new Iraq will be a </p><p>democratic country where freedom of expression and pluralism </p><p>will be practiced. This new model of Iraq will undoubtedly </p><p>disturb the countries neighboring Iraq. Therefore, those </p><p>countries will attempt to sabotage this regime." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "A New Reading" </p><p>Dr. Yasser Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-A\'am </p><p>(5/06):  "During his visit to Baghdad, the prophet of </p><p>democracy to our region, Donald Rumsfeld, asked Iraqis who </p><p>admire the Islamic regime in Iran to leave Iraq and go to </p><p>Iran. We don\'t know if he also advised the Iraqis who admire </p><p>the American system to leave for the US, but we are certain </p><p>that the attempt to deport Iraqi oppositionists will not be </p><p>accepted by the Iraqi people. It seems that the arrogance of </p><p>the Americans is based on emotion not rationality." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Arab League and Its Continued Failure" </p><p>Mohammad Al-Saddiqi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(5/06):  "It seems that the Arab League is facing a </p><p>financial problem because Kuwait and the UAE have abstained </p><p>from paying their share in the Arab League. In confronting </p><p>this political and financial dilemma, we should seriously </p><p>think of the existence and the need for the Arab League in </p><p>solving the Arab countries problems. The Arab League has </p><p>proven that it is incapable of achieving Arab unity, leading </p><p>us to think seriously about closing this entity and looking </p><p>for other means." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "You are Not the Guardians of the Iraqi People" </p><p>Laila Al-Othman wrote in independent Al-Qabas (5/07):  "Why </p><p>do Arab satellite television channels continue agitation </p><p>against the freedom of Iraqis? Why do they hate to see the </p><p>Iraqis enjoying the taste of freedom? . Arab satellite </p><p>channels must realize that the years of oppression against </p><p>the Iraqis have taught them ways to defend their existence </p><p>and to defend their country. Iraqis do not need others to </p><p>sow sedition among them. Leave the Iraqi people alone, and </p><p>do not [attempt to] be their guardians. Very soon you will </p><p>witness a new Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
