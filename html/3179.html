<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001216 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, PTER, NP, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S KING HEADS TO INDIA AFTER COMPLETING FIRST </p><p>YEAR ON THRONE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 1673 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The first trip abroad as monarch by Nepal\'s </p><p>King Gyanendra will be a visit to India June 23-30. </p><p>Gyanendra laid the groundwork for the trip in his first-ever </p><p>interview with the foreign press, granted to a leading Indian </p><p>daily, when he played to India\'s conservative government by </p><p>emphasizing the common cultural heritage shared by Nepal and </p><p>India.  The King\'s visit comes on the heels of an Indian </p><p>military delegation\'s assessment tour of Nepal and </p><p>controversy surrounding Indian government allegations that </p><p>Pakistani militants are operating from Nepali soil.  He will </p><p>likely seek New Delhi\'s help combating the Maoist insurgency </p><p>and support for Nepal\'s embattled democracy, while India will </p><p>push for Kathmandu to crack down on rumored anti-Indian </p><p>elements.  Gyanendra has become less unpopular over the past </p><p>year, burnishing his image by appearing in a ceremonial role </p><p>at religious events and making measured statements to the </p><p>press in support of the constitution.  Given the </p><p>extraordinary and traumatic circumstances accompanying the </p><p>beginning of Gyanendra\'s reign -- the massacre of the late </p><p>King and all other heirs to the throne -- he will have to </p><p>continue to work hard to assert the legitmacy of his </p><p>authority with the Nepali public.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>New King\'s First Trip Abroad </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nepal\'s King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah travels to New </p><p>Delhi June 23 on his first trip abroad as monarch.  Laden </p><p>with bilateral symbolism, Gyanendra\'s week-long visit </p><p>reportedly will also include stops at the Kamakhya temple </p><p>near Guwahati in the northeastern state of Assam and in </p><p>Calcutta, where he will worship at the Kali Temple and meet </p><p>with West Bengal\'s Chief Minister.  The head of Nepal\'s </p><p>chambers of commerce federation will accompany the royals and </p><p>hold separate meetings, including with the Commerce Minister. </p><p> According to a leading businessmen with extremely close ties </p><p>to the palace, India\'s PM Vajpayee hosts a private dinner for </p><p>the King upon his arrival in India, the evening before the </p><p>official program begins.  Such hospitality is extraordinary, </p><p>the businessman asserted, and signifies the importance the PM </p><p>ascribed to the visit.  (Note:  The last visit of a Nepalese </p><p>monarch to India was in January 1999, when King Birendra </p><p>visited New Delhi and made a pilgrimage to see spiritual </p><p>leader "Sai Baba" in South India.  Birendra was a frequent </p><p>visitor to India, and both he and Gyanendra attended school </p><p>there as boys.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Special Relationship and Common Heritage </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The businessman also portrayed the visit as a chance </p><p>for the King to capitalize on his impressive speaking </p><p>ability.  During a recent interview with the editor of The </p><p>Times of India -- his first to a foreign journalist since </p><p>becoming King -- Gyanendra already employed his rhetorical </p><p>skills to set the tone for the upcoming visit in remarks </p><p>gauged to appeal to India\'s conservative government.  For </p><p>example, Gyanendra told The Times that "relations between </p><p>Nepal and India are nurtured and enriched by noble ideals, </p><p>values and principles inherent in a shared cultural </p><p>heritage."  The two countries enjoy "traditional bonds as </p><p>good neighbors," and Indo-Nepalese ties "remain special </p><p>because they are practical, pragmatic and beneficial." </p><p> </p><p>India\'s Military on Assessment Tour </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) These "pragmatic" relations will likely take the </p><p>concrete form of additional Indian military assistance. </p><p>Gyanendra\'s visit to India will come on the heels of an </p><p>inspection by a four-officer Indian military assessment team </p><p>now in Nepal.  Led by a Major General, the team is visiting </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) facilities at Dharan, Nepalgunj and </p><p>Gorkha.  A military source confided to DATT that the team\'s </p><p>visit is redundant, as India is well aware of Nepal\'s needs </p><p>due to the well-developed and on-going relations between the </p><p>two militaries.  The speculation is that India launched the </p><p>team to re-assert India\'s primary role in providing security </p><p>assistance to Nepal after a U.S. PACOM team spent 22 days in </p><p>the Kingdom in April. </p><p> </p><p>Pakistani Militants Reported in Nepal </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) The King\'s visit also comes in the wake of </p><p>headline-grabbing statements by Indian Home Minister Advani </p><p>charging that bases have been established in Nepal by two </p><p>Pakistan-based militant groups:  Lashkar-e-Toiba and </p><p>Jaish-e-Mohammed.  Nepal\'s Foreign Ministry denied reports </p><p>that New Delhi provided Kathmandu with information about such </p><p>bases, but added that Nepal would take appropriate action if </p><p>such evidence came to light. </p><p> </p><p>All Uphill Year for the Monarchy </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Gyanendra was crowned King on June 4, 2001 in the </p><p>midst of rioting that followed the shooting deaths of King </p><p>Birendra and eight other family members on June 1.  (Note: </p><p>The King will come out of mourning for his late brother </p><p>Birendra only on June 20, and for his late nephew and </p><p>regicide Dipendra on June 22, auspicious dates marking the </p><p>end of the lunar year of mourning.  Observers expect him to </p><p>become an even more visible presence after those dates.  End </p><p>Note.)  Widely unpopular at the time of his enthronement -- </p><p>many suspected him of having a hand in the June 1 massacre -- </p><p>the new King has gained the reluctant acceptance of the </p><p>Nepalese public over the past year.  Carefully calculated </p><p>appearances at religious ceremonies and measured public </p><p>statements helped burnish his image.  Some observers add that </p><p>the King\'s status has appreciated in part because he compares </p><p>favorably with Nepal\'s fractious and ineffectual elected </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>Playing the Religion Card </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) According to Nepalese tradition, the King of Nepal </p><p>is an incarnation of Vishnu, a major deity in the Hindu </p><p>pantheon.  Gyanendra has played up that role in a string of </p><p>public appearances at religious sites and ceremonies.  He has </p><p>even appeared at religious occasions that his father, </p><p>Mahendra, presided over, but that were neglected by his late </p><p>brother Birendra over the past quarter century.  Establishing </p><p>his role as a religious figure has helped him gain acceptance </p><p>among Nepal\'s mostly Hindu population -- less than one-third </p><p>of whom are literate. </p><p> </p><p>Voicing Support for Constitution </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In public statements and press interviews Gyanendra </p><p>has tried to allay anxieties in some political circles that </p><p>he nurtured aspirations of sweeping aside the democratic </p><p>system, as his father did.  The King has voiced strong </p><p>support for Nepal\'s constitutional system and called for </p><p>higher standards of governance and an end to violence </p><p>(Reftel).   An interview he gave to Nepal\'s official press </p><p>service to mark the anniversary of his enthronement was "very </p><p>well received," according to a local journalist.  In it the </p><p>King said that "public disenchantment and distrust grows if </p><p>the basic needs of the people are not fulfilled and state </p><p>leaders show indifference to the people\'s aspirations." </p><p>Asked what role he would play if a failure to hold </p><p>Parliamentary elections provoked a crisis, he declined to </p><p>answer, labeling the question "hypothetical." </p><p> </p><p>The Long, Prudent View </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Most observers agree that Nepal\'s royal palace may be </p><p>the only political institution in Nepal focussed on the long </p><p>view.  To date, the King has gone by the book, supporting the </p><p>constitutional limits on the monarchy in both word and </p><p>practice.  As a leading Nepali journalist put it, the King </p><p>knows that if he is personally adventurous, it will be </p><p>"doomsday" for his dynasty.  At present, Nepal\'s political </p><p>parties are weak and fractious, but eventually they will be </p><p>strong again -- and will remember everything the King did, </p><p>the journalist concluded. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Gyanendra\'s early visit to New Delhi is clearly </p><p>calculated to signify acknowledgement of the importance of </p><p>India in shaping Nepal\'s future.  Indian assistance will be </p><p>key to defeating the Maoist insurgency and to stabilizing the </p><p>democratic system in what will be a tenuous run-up to </p><p>November elections.  We assume the King will seek to solidify </p><p>GOI support for the campaign against the Maoist insurgents </p><p>and will want to request Vajpayee\'s assistance in supporting </p><p>Nepal\'s democracy during the current constitutional crisis. </p><p>One way would be for India to continue to reign in recently </p><p>unseated Nepali Congress Party (NCP) President and former </p><p>Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, who maintains close links with </p><p>Indian political leaders.  In return, New Delhi will likely </p><p>press for more proactive Nepali action against anti-Indian </p><p>militants reportedly operating out of Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ironically, the King has been nurturing his image </p><p>domestically at the same time that the public image of the </p><p>NCP -- the party historically with the closest ties to India </p><p>-- is at an all-time low.  In his interview with The Times </p><p>the King struck a fine balance between emphasizing equality </p><p>and sovereignty for the benefit of his domestic audience and </p><p>giving a nod to the "special relationship" with India.  The </p><p>emphasis on his religious role should also play well with </p><p>India\'s Hindu nationalists.  As Nepal\'s political leaders </p><p>fight amongst themselves in the lead-up to the elections </p><p>called for November, Gyanendra will likely continue to act </p><p>with an eye to posterity, playing on his roles as both </p><p>constitutional monarch and living deity in an attempt to </p><p>establish the legitimacy of his authority.  Given the unusual </p><p>and distressing circumstances under which King Gyanendra </p><p>acceded to the throne, the year-long mourning period may </p><p>actually have worked in his favor as it gave the shocked and </p><p>suspicious Nepali public time to accept the idea of him as </p><p>monarch. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
