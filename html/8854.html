SECSTATE 7011 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reason 1.5 (b, </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request - see paragraph 13. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Begin summary:  Yemen has launched an aggressive </p><p>11th hour campaign for the return of Sheikh Mohamed Ali </p><p>al-Moayed, now awaiting an extradition ruling in Germany on </p><p>charges of support for terrorist organizations.  After </p><p>raising the case with FBI Mueller on June 2, the ROYG </p><p>dispatched two high level envoys to Germany on 6/17.  On </p><p>6/18, FM Qirbi called in the Charge to appeal for Moayed\'s </p><p>return to Yemen for prosecution in lieu of extradition to the </p><p>US, citing his age, poor health, political naivet, high </p><p>national standing as a cleric and philanthropist, and the </p><p>growing \'street\' conviction that he has been judicially </p><p>kidnapped by the FBI.  Also on 6/18, a close advisor to ROYG </p><p>President Saleh contacted the Charge to convey Saleh\'s </p><p>personal request for Moayed\'s return to Yemen and a proposal </p><p>for a joint U.S./Yemeni investigation in Sanaa.   Saleh is </p><p>traveling to Germany later this week and has requested a </p><p>response before he departs Yemen.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  With the German ruling on Sheikh Mohammed Ali </p><p>al-Moayed\'s extradition to the US imminent, the ROYG has </p><p>mounted an intense effort to bring Moayed back to Yemen. </p><p>That effort is spurred by pressure from Islah, the </p><p>conservative Muslim opposition party, as well as a growing </p><p>media campaign and high-level appeals to President Saleh in </p><p>support of the Sheikh.  President Saleh, who personally </p><p>authorized funds for Moayed\'s defense team in Germany, raised </p><p>the case with visiting FBI Director Mueller on June 2, saying </p><p>that ROYG considers Moayed a businessman, not a terrorist </p><p>(ref A).  Saleh suggested that the U.S. have the CIA and FBI </p><p>investigate Moayed\'s activities, and, when the investigation </p><p>is over, the U.S. should turn Moayed over to ROYG to perform </p><p>its own investigation.  Director Mueller assured President </p><p>Saleh that significant evidence of links to terrorist </p><p>financing have been collected against Moayed and the case </p><p>against him is quite strong. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  With the extradition decision expected later this </p><p>month, President Saleh ordered Isma\'il Ahmad al-Wazir and </p><p>Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim, members of his Shura (Consultative) </p><p>Council, to travel to Germany on 6/17 to follow the case of </p><p>Moayed and his assistant, Mohammed Zayad.  According to Saba, </p><p>the official news agency, the two envoys will join Moayed\'s </p><p>defense team and offer legal evidence to prove the </p><p>defendant\'s "incorruptibility." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  During a 6/18 meeting held at FM Qirbi\'s behest, the </p><p>Charge was informed of ROYG\'s concern over a letter from </p><p>Moayed\'s lawyers in Germany complaining about their inability </p><p>to review U.S. provided evidence against their clients. </p><p>Qirbi said he discussed this concern with the German </p><p>Ambassador on June 17 and delivered a diplomatic note (text </p><p>paragraph 15).  The Foreign Minister noted ROYG is focusing </p><p>on the political as well as legal aspects of this case.  Many </p><p>Yemenis view Moayed as a religious, charitable leader.  Qirbi </p><p>voiced ROYG fears Moayed\'s extradition to the U.S. will </p><p>derail ROYG efforts to enlist popular support for the war </p><p>against terror, and could destabilize the country. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Qirbi suggested that Yemen, Germany, and the U.S. </p><p>could get together to work this out, in lieu of proceeding </p><p>with the extradition.  He believes that, even if Moayed had </p><p>contact with terrorist organizations, he probably didn\'t know </p><p>what he was doing.  Referring to the U.S. "entrapment" of </p><p>Moayed, Qirbi commented dryly that he is clearly easily duped </p><p>and misled. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  In response, the Charge assured Qirbi that he would </p><p>relay the ROYG\'s concerns to Washington.  He noted that this </p><p>is not a personal attack against Moayed, as it has been </p><p>portrayed in the local press, but part of a worldwide </p><p>initiative to disrupt terrorist funding.  Asked if the ROYG </p><p>had informed Moayed\'s supporters of the various assurances on </p><p>Moayed requested by Germany and provided by the USG, Qirbi </p><p>replied in the affirmative.  These assurances were an </p><p>important positive element, he said, but not enough. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  With the extradition ruling expected soon, the </p><p>Charge highlighted the importance of sharing information in </p><p>the coming days.  Moayed\'s defense team should urge him to </p><p>begin cooperating fully with U.S. investigators, especially </p><p>by providing full details of fund-raising in the U.S.  Qirbi </p><p>agreed, but added that, if information, including information </p><p>on terrorism, was the major goal, it would be better for </p><p>Moayed to be interrogated in Germany by U.S. and Yemeni </p><p>security.  He would be more cooperative in those </p><p>circumstances than if he were taken to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Qirbi further noted that the defense team was </p><p>concerned about Moayed\'s deteriorating health, which has also </p><p>been cited in recent press reports.  He asked that we confirm </p><p>or deny this information. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  At 10:00pm on 6/18 Mohamed Sudam, personal advisor </p><p>and translator to President Saleh called the Charge to convey </p><p>"an urgent personal message from President Saleh to the U.S. </p><p>Administration".  The message (text para 14) is urgent -- </p><p>Saleh travels to Germany on Friday June 20 and Moayed is </p><p>among his top concerns. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Comment:  These unusual late night demarches </p><p>immediately follow Qirbi\'s strong pitch to Charge earlier in </p><p>the day.  The structure and phrasing of this evening\'s </p><p>message (para 14), no less than the fact that it was </p><p>delivered by the President\'s go-to adviser for dealings with </p><p>the Americans, indicates that it really is a personal message </p><p>from Saleh. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Comment continued:  The suggestion that the U.S. </p><p>interrogate al-Moayed in Germany, or, even better, return him </p><p>to Yemen for prosecution, reflects Saleh\'s genuine worry over </p><p>domestic consequences if Moayed is sent to the U.S.  It also </p><p>reflects his strong belief that political problems are best </p><p>handled by personal negotiations, not by impartial judicial </p><p>proceedings.  For Saleh, the weight of evidence against </p><p>Moayed is easily balanced by the political consequences of </p><p>angry domestic reaction as well as the increased economic </p><p>devastation that would follow another terrorist attack </p><p>against US or German interests.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Action Requested:  Please advise if it will be </p><p>possible to provide Post with a NIACT reply by COB 6/19 on: </p><p>1) Response to Saleh\'s request that Moayed be returned to </p><p>Yemen; 2) ROYG request that Moayed be interrogated in </p><p>Germany; and/or 3) an update on Moayed\'s health condition. </p><p>Charge told Qirbi on 6/18 that the best way to transform this </p><p>case constructively would be for Moayed himself to cooperate </p><p>with U.S. investigators seeking information on fund-raising </p><p>in the U.S.  Post offers this as a possible point for </p><p>inclusion in a U.S. reply to Saleh. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Text of President Saleh\'s 6/18 personal message to </p><p>the U.S. Administration: </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p> </p><p>President Saleh submits his personal request that al-Moayed </p><p>be released and handed over to Yemen.  This is justified </p><p>because he was not involved in terrorist acts.  If he had </p><p>been, Yemen would be the first to investigate him, arrest him </p><p>and break his head (sic). </p><p> </p><p>After his return to Yemen, he would be kept under arrest. </p><p>There could be a joint U.S.-Yemeni investigation.  If the USG </p><p>wishes, Germany could also participate. </p><p> </p><p>This question is being submitted in the common interest of </p><p>Yemen and the United States. </p><p> </p><p>The President will leave for Germany in the next two days, </p><p>and hopes to receive a positive answer from the U.S. side </p><p>prior to his departure. </p><p> </p><p>(End Text) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  Text of ROYG\'s June 17, 2003 diplomatic note to the </p><p>German Embassy: </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p> </p><p>No.: 1/144/102/1315 </p><p>Date: June 17, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Republic of Yemen </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Minister\'s Office </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen </p><p>presents its best compliments to the Embassy of the friendly </p><p>Germany in Sana\'a. </p><p>In reference to the subject of the two Yemen citizens Mohamed </p><p>Ali Hasan al-Maiad and his companion, the Ministry could not </p><p>understand the deprivation of the defense lawyers of the two </p><p>arrested Yemeni citizens, requested for extradition by the </p><p>United States of America, from knowing the decisively </p><p>important records in connection of the evaluation of the U.S. </p><p>request of their extradition.  The Ministry could not either </p><p>understand the uncertainty of the legal prosecution that </p><p>deprives the two-mentioned lawyers from knowing the referred </p><p>records.  On the basis of all these uncertainties expressed, </p><p>the Yemeni party has inquired the details of the subject once </p><p>again in a way that allows it to corroborate what is </p><p>mentioned as follows: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. request for extradition is basically founded on </p><p>extracted information according to the information mentioned </p><p>in the request of the U.S. including audio records and </p><p>recorded video tapes in Frankfurt.  These records, judging </p><p>upon the circumstances in which they were taken and the </p><p>permission of their transforming to be in U.S.\'s possession </p><p>must, logically and legally speaking, be submitted by German </p><p>authorities.  Therefore, the legal interest of the two Yemeni </p><p>citizens, without any additional explanation, is not </p><p>obviously guaranteed to be fairly and objectively handled </p><p>unless the defense lawyers have the access to find out the </p><p>information the records contain.  These lawyers were not able </p><p>to do so although they frequently requested to find out the </p><p>information the records contain whether from the concerned </p><p>authorities or even getting the records from these </p><p>authorities, having a look at them and eventually returning </p><p>them back later.  In addition, these lawyers were not </p><p>informed even of the names of proper authorities that keep </p><p>the records and the reference number that these files carry. </p><p>What these lawyers know is only reference number that enables </p><p>them to ask for a legal assistance from the Public </p><p>Prosecution in the Regional Frankfurt Court.  The number of </p><p>the reference is 9409AR204640/02.  That file does not </p><p>contain, according to the Public Prosecution, any reports </p><p>regarding the records conducted while the two Yemen citizens </p><p>were subjected to monitoring.  In addition, the request of </p><p>the two defense lawyers to find out what the file with the </p><p>mentioned reference contains was not responded to. </p><p> </p><p>The Yemeni party sees what is going on as a quite striking </p><p>fact when the defense lawyers were deprived in such a way to </p><p>go ahead and defend the two Yemeni citizens. </p><p> </p><p>The government of the Yemen would like to mention here what </p><p>was mentioned in the note received from the lawyer Mr. Klaus </p><p>Gunter Newman dated March 27, 2003 that requests the return </p><p>of the two Yemeni citizens to their country instead of that </p><p>practice that represents a violation of the International </p><p>Law.  The government of Yemen renews its request of the </p><p>return of the two Yemeni citizens and handing them over to </p><p>Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this </p><p>opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the friendly German </p><p>Republic its best respect and highest appreciation. </p><p> </p><p>To:  The Embassy of Germany </p><p>     Sana\'a </p><p> </p><p>(End text) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
