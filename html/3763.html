<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPARTMENT, PLEASE PASS TO USTR, EXIM BANK AND USTDA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: THE PRESS GETS IT WRONG: NO DEBT PAYMENT </p><p>MORATORIUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (U) CLASSIFIED BY BRIAN BROWNE </p><p>     B. POL COUNS. FOR REASONS 1.5 B & D </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Recent press reports have incoreectly </p><p>claimed Nigeria had stopped foreign debt payments. Central </p><p>Bank of Nigeria Governor Joseph Sanusi, whose August 27 press </p><p>statement was cited as the basis of the report, as well as </p><p>other government sources, confirm that Sanusi was the victim </p><p>of poor reporting.  Guided by the pragmatism that necessity </p><p>impels, the principal GON mechanism for coping with revenue </p><p>shortfalls to date has been delaying or reducing all payments </p><p>(foreign debt included).  Moreover, official GON policy since </p><p>1994 has been to put a $1.5 billion payment ceiling on </p><p>foreign debt, with most of the shortfall being placed on </p><p>Paris Club debt.  This policy, announced by Debt Management </p><p>Office Director General Akin Arikawe last December, </p><p>incorporated in the 2002 budget, and reconfirmed by Sanusi at </p><p>his misinterpreted press briefing, has not changed.  In </p><p>short, Sanusi reiterated extant policy.  This may not be the </p><p>most welcomed news to Nigeria,s creditors who would like to </p><p>see the GON become more forthcoming on debt payments. </p><p>However, the reality that Nigeria will continue its policy of </p><p>partial payments is better than a debt moratorium.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>What Sanusi Said </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The August 27 press briefing was Sanusi,s third </p><p>Review of the State of the Nigerian Economy in 2002.  The </p><p>principal topics presented were the drop in foreign exchange </p><p>reserves (from US $10.27 billion in December 2001 to $8.29 </p><p>billion in the middle of July 2002) and an evaluation of the </p><p>Dutch Auction System (DAS) re-introduced in late July to stem </p><p>the hemorrhaging of foreign exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Neither the GON "announcement" it would stop external </p><p>debt payments nor the "warning" about external debt </p><p>shortfalls  was carried in the Nigerian press.  Calls to CBN </p><p>Governor Sanusi, CBN head of Research Joe Nnanna, and </p><p>Director General of the Debt Management Office Akin Arikawe </p><p>leave no doubt that the foreign correspondents misinterpreted </p><p>Sanusi\'s statement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Foreign Debt Payments - $1.5 Billion Ceiling </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Elaborating on Sanusi\'s press conference, CBN </p><p>Research Director Joseph Nnanna told Econoffs that Nigeria </p><p>planned to make full payment on the US $1.5 billion it had </p><p>budgeted for external debt.  He insisted "We are obligated to </p><p>pay it under the Constitution," a tongue-in-cheek reference </p><p>to the impeachment argument by National Assembly members that </p><p>President Obasanjo had not executed (spent) the entire budget </p><p>they had passed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nnanna explained that $1.5 billion had been the </p><p>ceiling for external debt payments that former military Head </p><p>of State Sani Abacha had instituted in 1994.  Capping debt </p><p>payments had been a popular move, one that neither the </p><p>current President nor National Assembly dare rescind. To </p><p>date, the GON has been keeping current on multilateral, </p><p>non-Paris Club bilateral, and London Club debt (commercial </p><p>debt that was restructured in 1992).  The GON has kept within </p><p>its debt ceiling by paying an increasingly smaller portion of </p><p>Paris Club debt, which accounts for roughly 78 per cent of </p><p>its total foreign debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nnanna emphasized that it was not only foreign debt </p><p>that had not been paid during the first part of the year. </p><p>The GON withheld salaries and pension payments and hewed the </p><p>line on capital project expendituresduring the same part of </p><p>the year.  "We will not spend money we do not have nor can we </p><p>exceed the 12.5 per cent deficit financing agreement we have </p><p>with the Executive."   Nevertheless, Nnanna believed that the </p><p>oil revenues for Nigeria would begin a recovery. "Our oil is </p><p>not sold on the spot market but on the three to six-month </p><p>futures market. This spring we suffered from last fall\'s drop </p><p>in crude prices but should see stronger income in the second </p><p>half of the year." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Director General of Nigeria\'s Debt Management Office </p><p>Akin Arikawe confirmed that reports of a debt moratorium were </p><p>false. Nonetheless, Arikawe privately expressed concern about </p><p>Nigeria\'s ability to meet the $1.5 billion dollar target and </p><p>was openly frustrated with Nigeria\'s lack of success to date </p><p>in winning debt concessions from the Paris Club nations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Foreign Exchange Reserves, Debt Payment and the Dutch Auction </p><p>System (DAS) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Nigeria fell from a balance of payment surplus of </p><p>Naira 51.1 billion in the first half of 2001 to a deficit of </p><p>Naira 386 billion in the first half of 2002, reported Sanusi. </p><p> Much of that deficit was financed by drawing down foreign </p><p>exchange reserves.  For the first six months of 2002, foreign </p><p>exchange inflows totaled US $3.8 billion against $5.37 </p><p>billion in outlays.  Sanusi noted 80 percent of total </p><p>official foreign exchange disbursements (IFEM) were spent on </p><p>imports of goods, 30 percent of which were finished goods </p><p>that could easily be produced in Nigeria.   He added that </p><p>Nigeria,s foreign exchange position would have been worse, </p><p>had the CBN not delayed payment on foreign debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The CBN Governor defended the DAS as a necessary step </p><p>in dealing with problems with foreign exchange reserves. </p><p>Through the DAS, he said the parallel market premium had been </p><p>significantly reduced.  Instead of setting off a continuous </p><p>Naira depreciation and unleashing new inflationary pressures, </p><p>the DAS had stabilized the Naira rate stabilized and eased </p><p>inflationary pressures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Sanusi blamed the vestigial parallel market premium </p><p>on the "activities of tax-evaders and impostors who avoid </p><p>tariffs through non or inappropriate documentation."  He </p><p>further praised the DAS which "promotes openness and </p><p>unrestrained transparency in the determination of the </p><p>exchange rate.  More importantly, the CBN has firmer control </p><p>over the amount of foreign exchange it offers to the market </p><p>and is thereby placed in a better position to protect and </p><p>manage the nation\'s external reserves." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Other highlights from the press briefing: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Inflation on a moving 12-month average decelerated from </p><p>18.9 per cent in December 2001 to a projected 15.8 per cent </p><p>in July 2002.  The one-month inflation rate fell to 10.2 per </p><p>cent in May 2002 and was expected to be in single digits when </p><p>the final July numbers were tallied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Manufacturing utilization capacity in the first half of </p><p>2002 grew to 40.1 per cent from 35.5 per cent a year earlier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Growth of the narrow money supply (M1) slowed to 5.5 per </p><p>cent for the first half of 2002, within the programmed target </p><p>of 12.4 per cent for the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Sanusi Calls for Naira Based on Productivity of the Economy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Sanusi took a strong stand on the need to depreciate </p><p>the Naira, an unpopular position with most Nigerians who </p><p>"have been too sensitive for too long on the value of the </p><p>Naira, forgetting that the value can only be the efficiency </p><p>and productivity of the economy.  Our sensitivity to Naira </p><p>exchange rates derives from our import dependency which is </p><p>facilitated by earnings from oil.  It is not sustainable for </p><p>Nigeria to use its earning from oil to create jobs in other </p><p>countries." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Comment:  The GON continues to struggle with economic </p><p>policy, but there are signs of progress.  For reasons of both </p><p>fiscal discipline and political advantage, the Executive and </p><p>CBN have held the line on spending this year.  That restraint </p><p>has simultaneously exacted costs while also paying limited </p><p>dividends.  For example, the sudden drop in the forex </p><p>reserves was partially caused by the GON\'s fiscal discipline. </p><p> However, decline in forex reserves gave the CBN the </p><p>political cover necessary to introduce the DAS which has </p><p>resulted in a significant depreciation of the Naira.  And, </p><p>Sanusi has taken another step forward by arguing for a </p><p>further depreciation that reflects Nigeria,s true </p><p>macroeconomic position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Read in its entirety, Sanusi,s statement indicates </p><p>that the CBN, if not the entire GON, recognizes the need for </p><p>fiscal and monetary reform.  We should encourage the CBN to </p><p>take additional steps that bring the Naira rate more in line </p><p>with market reality and to encourage the GON to meet its </p><p>foreign debt commitment.  However, we must also realize the </p><p>political constraints that make reform piecemeal, uneven, and </p><p>often controversial.  Additionally, while we call Nigeria to </p><p>task for what is not going right, we should equally </p><p>acknowledge the attempts at reform it is making.  End Comment </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
