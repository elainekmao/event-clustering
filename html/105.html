<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 00594 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, KPAL, JO, SY, XF </p><p>SUBJECT:   PLO OFFICIALS SAY ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP IS THE </p><p>           BEST SUPPLIED IN SYRIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  AN EMBASSY PALESTINIAN CONTACT HAS REPORTED </p><p>TWO SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS WITH PLO OFFICIALS </p><p>HERE ABOUT THE ABU NIDAL PRESENCE IN DAMASCUS. </p><p>BOTH OFFICIALS--OMAR SHAKA\'A, THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>PLO POLITICAL DEPARTMENT OFFICE IN AMMAN AND </p><p>A PROTOGEE OF FAROUK QADDUMI AND HAMADNEH FARANEH, </p><p>A DFLP MEMBER WHO WAS RECENTLY ARRESTED BY GOJ </p><p>OFFICIALS--THOUGHT IT CURIOUS THAT THE USG WAS </p><p>REACTING SO FORCEFULLY TO SUSPECTED LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE ROME AND VIENNA TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND </p><p>IGNORING SYRIA WHEN SYRIA, THEY SAID, WAS JUST </p><p>AS INVOLVED AS LIBYA.  ACCORDING TO BOTH MEN, </p><p>ABU NIDAL\'S OPERATIONS IN DAMASCUS ARE SUPPORTED </p><p>MORE LAVISHLY BY THE SYRIANS THAN THOSE OF </p><p>ANY OTHER PALESTINIAN GROUP--THEY GET MORE MONEY, </p><p>BETTER FACILITIES, BETTER TRAINING, AND BETTER </p><p>EQUIPMENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  WE CANNOT COMMENT ON THE ACCURACY OF </p><p>THESE OBSERVATIONS, BUT PASS THEM ALONG AS INDICATING </p><p>THE PERCEPTIONS OF PALESTINIANS IN JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
