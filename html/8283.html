<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 002327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IT, IT, PREL, PRELEU </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MFA ON CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: IN A MAY 14 DISCUSSION ON THE EU </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, MFA DIRECTOR FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02327  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>LEGAL AFFAIRS, GUISEPPE BUCCINO, TOLD EMBASSY POLOFF THAT A </p><p>TREATY SIGNING CEREMONY DURING THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY WAS </p><p>HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  BUCCINO STATED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPERATIVE </p><p>FOR THE IRISH TO CONCLUDE WORK ON THE IGC BY THE END OF THEIR </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN JUNE 2004 OR THE MOMENTUM COMING OUT OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION WILL BE LOST.  ITALY SUPPORTS GISCARD\'S PROPOSAL </p><p>TO REPLACE THE SIX-MONTH ROTATING PRESIDENCY WITH A FULL-TIME </p><p>COUNCIL CHAIRMAN, ELECTED FOR A RENEWABLE 2 1/2-YEAR TERM. </p><p>ITALY ALSO ENVISAGES A MERGING OF THE CFSP HIGH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE (SOLANA) AND COMMISSION EXTERNAL RELATIONS </p><p>COMMISSIONER (PATTEN) POSITIONS, INTO A SINGLE DOUBLE HATTED </p><p>EU FOREIGN MINISTER.  ON THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF </p><p>STRENGTHENED COOPERATION ON DEFENSE POLICY, ITALY INSISTS </p><p>THAT THE CRITERIA AND RULES FOR ENGAGEMENT MUST BE DECIDED BY </p><p>UNANIMITY (IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANOTHER ESDP MINI-DEFENSE </p><p>SUMMIT).   ITALY WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE CONVENTION\'S WORK </p><p>ON DEFENSE POLICY SUPPORTS BERLUSCONI\'S GOAL OF IMPROVING </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS.  BUCCINO WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH EMBASSY POLOFF ON THE CONVENTION\'S </p><p>PROGRESS AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  BUCCINO BEGAN THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IS A "STRANGE ANIMAL." ARTICLE 48 </p><p>OF THE TREATY OF ROME REQUIRES ANY CHANGES TO THAT TREATY TO </p><p>BE DECIDED BY MEMBER STATES IN THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>CONFERENCE (IGC). BUCCINO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT DUE TO THE LACK </p><p>OF VOTING POWER AMONG CONVENTION REPRESENTATIVES, DISCUSSIONS </p><p>TEND TO BE RATHER GENERAL AND, THUS, THE PRESENTATION OF A </p><p>FINAL PRODUCT IN THESSALONIKI SHOULD NOT BE OVERSTATED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION WILL LIKELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02327  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>CONTAIN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS ON THE MAIN INSTITUTIONAL TIE-UPS, </p><p>E.G. ON A FULL TIME COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND ON THE SIZE OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION.  BUCCINO ALSO ADMITTED THAT IT WOULD BE ALMOST </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE WORK OF THE IGC DURING ITALY\'S </p><p>PRESIDENCY, BUT STRESSED THE URGENCY IN COMPLETING THE </p><p>PROCESS BY THE END OF THE IRISH PRESIDENCY IN JUNE 2004. </p><p>OTHERWISE, THE EU WOULD BE FACING AN "INSTITUTIONAL MESS." </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS IN 2004, SUCH AS EU PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS AND REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, WHICH </p><p>WOULD DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE WORK OF THE CONVENTION. </p><p>BUCCINO NOTED THE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE OF SIGNING THE NEW </p><p>TREATY IN ROME AND INDICATED THAT THE IRISH AND OTHER EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES WOULD AGREE TO THIS AS LONG AS ITALY WORKS </p><p>FASTIDIOUSLY IN HELPING THE IRISH TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE </p><p>IGC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ITALY SUPPORTS CONVENTION PRESIDENT GISCARD\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL TO REPLACE THE SIX-MONTH ROTATING PRESIDENCY OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNCIL WITH A FULL-TIME CHAIRMAN, ELECTED FOR A </p><p>RENEWABLE 2 1/2-YEAR TERM.  BUCCINO DESCRIBED TWO MAIN ROLES </p><p>FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL: PREPARING, CHAIRING AND FOLLOWING UP THE </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, AND REPRESENTING THE EU ON </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE (WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE </p><p>COMPETENCIES OF THE COMMISSION, OR THE DAILY CONDUCT OF </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY BY THE EU FOREIGN MINISTER).  BUCCINO NOTED </p><p>THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE SMALLER MEMBER </p><p>STATES AND ACCESSION COUNTRIES, WHICH SEE IT AS A PLOT TO </p><p>CREATE A DIRECTOIRE OF THE BIG STATES.  ITALY RECOGNIZES THAT </p><p>FAILURE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE COULD </p><p>ENDANGER THE CONVENTION\'S CHANCES OF SUBMITTING A FINAL TEXT </p><p>AT THESSALONIKI.  ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, ITALY HOPES TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02327  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>FACILITATE A COMPROMISE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE THESSALONIKI IN </p><p>ORDER TO EASE OF THE WORK OF THE IGC. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ITALY ALSO ENVISAGES A MERGING OF THE CFSP HIGH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE (SOLANA) AND COMMISSION EXTERNAL RELATIONS </p><p>COMMISSIONER (PATTEN) POSITIONS, INTO A SINGLE DOUBLE HATTED </p><p>EU FOREIGN MINISTER.  ITALY\'S GOAL IS TO SIMPLIFY THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE EU AND, THUS, BELIEVES A </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER WOULD PROVIDE FOR MORE CONSISTENCY AND </p><p>EFFICIENCY IN EU EXTERNAL POLICY.  A MAJORITY OF MEMBER </p><p>STATES SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AS LONG AS THERE IS A GENUINE </p><p>DOUBLE HATING WITH A LOCATION IN BOTH INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>BUCCINO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE ARE TECHNICAL DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>AMONG MEMBER STATES AS TO HOW THIS PERSON SHOULD BE NOMINATED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BUCCINO SAID THAT ITALY HAS OBJECTIONS TO THE </p><p>CONVENTION\'S WORK ON DEFENSE POLICY, SPECIFICALLY ARTICLE </p><p>30.6 OF THE PRESIDIUM\'S DRAFT TEXT.  GISCARD\'S PROPOSAL CALLS </p><p>FOR STRENGTHENED COOPERATION ON DEFENSE POLICY, BUT PROVIDES </p><p>NO STRICT CRITERIA OR RULES FOR ENGAGEMENT.  ITALY\'S </p><p>OBJECTION IS THAT ARTICLE 30.6 LEGITIMIZES A GROUP OF MEMBER </p><p>STATES TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE EU, AS OCCURRED DURING </p><p>THE ESDP MINI-SUMMIT.  ITALY\'S POSITION IS THAT STRENGTHENED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3066 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02327  02 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------6B5FD8  271651Z /38 </p><p>P 271651Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0098 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IT, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MFA ON CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>COOPERATION MUST BE DECIDED BY UNANIMITY IN ORDER TO ENSURE </p><p>MEMBER STATES ARE WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON EUROPEAN POSITION. </p><p> IN ITS ROLE AS EU PRESIDENT, ITALY WANTS TO GUARANTEE THAT </p><p>THE CONVENTION\'S WORK ON DEFENSE POLICY SUPPORTS ITALIAN PM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02327  02 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S GOAL OF CLOSING THE TRANSATLANTIC RIFT. </p><p> </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02327 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
