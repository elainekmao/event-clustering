<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 BAGHDAD 04237 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, US, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM\'S MESSAGE OF FRIENDSHIP TO PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: SADDAM TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JULY 25 </p><p>THAT MUBARAK HAS ARRANGED FOR KUWAITI AND IRAQI </p><p>DELEGATIONS TO MEET IN RIYADH, AND THEN ON </p><p>JULY 28, 29 OR 30, THE KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE WILL </p><p>COME TO BAGHDAD FOR SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS. "NOTHING </p><p>WILL HAPPEN" BEFORE THEN, SADDAM HAD PROMISED </p><p>MUBARAK. </p><p> </p><p>--SADDAM WISHED TO CONVEY AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH: IRAQ WANTS FRIENDSHIP, BUT DOES </p><p>THE USG? IRAQ SUFFERED 100,000\'S OF CASUALTIES </p><p>AND IS NOW SO POOR THAT WAR ORPHAN PENSIONS WILL </p><p>SOON BE CUT; YET RICH KUWAIT WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT </p><p>OPEC DISCIPLINE. IRAQ IS SICK OF WAR, BUT KUWAIT </p><p>HAS IGNORED DIPLOMACY. USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE </p><p>WILL ENCOURAGE THE UAE AND KUWAIT TO IGNORE </p><p>CONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY. IF IRAQ IS PUBLICLY </p><p>HUMILIATED BY THE USG, IT WILL HAVE NO CHOICE </p><p>BUT TO "RESPOND," HOWEVER ILLOGICAL AND SELF </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE THAT WOULD PROVE. </p><p> </p><p>--ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT, SADDAM\'S MESSAGE </p><p>TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH </p><p>TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK\'S DIPLOMACY, BUT WE MUST </p><p>TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE "SELFISHNESS" IS </p><p>UNBEARABLE. AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN </p><p>NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN </p><p>PEACEFUL MEANS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. AMBASSADOR WAS SUMMONED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>SADDAM HUSAYN AT NOON JULY 25. ALSO PRESENT </p><p>WERE FONMIN AZIZ, THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR, TWO NOTETAKERS, AND THE IRAQI </p><p>INTERPRETER. </p><p> </p><p>4. SADDAM, WHOSE MANNER WAS CORDIAL, </p><p>REASONABLE AND EVEN WARM THROUGHOUT THE ENSUING </p><p>TWO HOURS, SAID HE WISHED THE AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>CONVEY A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BUSH. SADDAM </p><p>THEN RECALLED IN DETAIL THE HISTORY OF IRAQ\'S </p><p>DECISION TO REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>AND ITS POSTPONING IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT </p><p>DECISION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, RATHER THAN BE </p><p>THOUGHT WEAK AND NEEDY. HE THEN SPOKE ABOUT THE </p><p>MANY "BLOWS" OUR RELATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO </p><p>SINCE 1984, CHIEF AMONG THEM IRANGATE. IT WAS </p><p>AFTER THE FAW VICTORY, SADDAM SAID, THAT IRAQI </p><p>MISAPPREHENSIONS ABOUT USG PURPOSES BEGAN TO </p><p>SURFACE AGAIN, I.E., SUSPICIONS THAT THE U.S. WAS </p><p>NOT HAPPY TO SEE THE WAR END. </p><p> </p><p>5. PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE, SADDAM SAID </p><p>THAT THERE ARE "SOME CIRCLES" IN THE USG, </p><p>INCLUDING IN CIA AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT, </p><p>BUT EMPHATICALLY EXCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>SECRETARY BAKER, WHO ARE NOT FRIENDLY TOWARD </p><p>IRAQ-U.S. RELATIONS. HE THEN LISTED WHAT HE </p><p>SEEMED TO REGARD AS FACTS TO SUPPORT THIS </p><p>CONCLUSION: "SOME CIRCLES ARE GATHERING </p><p>INFORMATION ON WHO MIGHT BE SADDAM HUSAYN\'S </p><p>SUCCESSOR;" THEY KEPT UP CONTACTS IN THE GULF </p><p>WARNING AGAINST IRAQ; THEY WORKED TO ENSURE </p><p>NO HELP WOULD GO TO IRAQ (READ EXIM AND CCC). </p><p> </p><p>6. IRAQ, THE PRESIDENT STRESSED, IS IN SERIOUS </p><p>FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WITH 40 BILLION USD DEBTS. </p><p>IRAQ, WHOSE VICTORY IN THE WAR AGAINST IRAN </p><p>MADE AN HISTORIC DIFFERENCE TO THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>AND THE WEST, NEEDS A MARSHALL PLAN. BUT "YOU </p><p>WANT THE OIL PRICE DOWN," SADDAM CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>7. RESUMING HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES WHICH HE </p><p>BELIEVED WERE ALL INSPIRED BY </p><p>"SOME CIRCLES" IN THE USG, HE RECALLED THE </p><p>"USIA CAMPAIGN" AGAINST HIMSELF, AND THE </p><p>GENERAL MEDIA ASSAULT ON IRAQ AND ITS PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. DESPITE ALL THESE BLOWS, SADDAM SAID, AND </p><p>ALTHOUGH "WE WERE SOMEWHAT ANNOYED," WE STILL </p><p>HOPED THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>BUT THOSE WHO FORCE OIL PRICES DOWN ARE ENGAGING </p><p>IN ECONOMIC WARFARE AND IRAQ CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH </p><p>A TRESPASS ON ITS DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE SPEARHEADS (FOR THE USG) HAVE BEEN KUWAIT </p><p>AND THE UAE, SADDAM SAID. SADDAM SAID CAREFULLY </p><p>THAT JUST AS IRAQ WILL NOT THREATEN OTHERS, IT </p><p>WILL ACCEPT NO THREAT AGAINST ITSELF. "WE HOPE </p><p>THE USG WILL NOT MISUNDERSTAND:" IRAQ ACCEPTS, </p><p>AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID, THAT ANY </p><p>COUNTRY MAY CHOOSE ITS FRIENDS. BUT THE USG KNOWS </p><p>THAT IT WAS IRAQ, NOT THE USG, WHICH DECISIVELY </p><p>PROTECTED THOSE USG FRIENDS DURING THE WAR--AND THAT </p><p>IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE USG, </p><p>TO SAY NOTHING OF GEOGRAPHY, WOULD HAVE MADE IT </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT 10,000 DEAD </p><p>IN A SINGLE BATTLE, AS IRAQ DID. </p><p> </p><p>10. SADDAM ASKED WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE USG </p><p>TO ANNOUNCE IT IS COMMITTED TO THE DEFENSE OF </p><p>ITS FRIENDS, INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. </p><p>ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION, HE SAID THAT TO IRAQ </p><p>IT MEANS FLAGRANT BIAS AGAINST THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>11. COMING TO ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS, SADDAM </p><p>ARGUED THAT USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE AND KUWAIT (SIC) </p><p>ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR UNGENEROUS POLICIES. THE </p><p>IRAQI RIGHTS, SADDAM EMPHASIZED, WILL BE RESTORED </p><p>ONE BY ONE, THOUGH IT MAY TAKE A MONTH OR MUCH </p><p>MORE THAN A YEAR. IRAQ HOPES THE USG WILL BE </p><p>IN HARMONY WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO THIS DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>12. SADDAM SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE USG IS </p><p>DETERMINED TO KEEP THE OIL FLOWING AND TO </p><p>MAINTAIN ITS FRIENDSHIPS IN THE GULF. WHAT HE </p><p>CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO </p><p>ARE DAMAGING IRAQ, WHICH IS WHAT OUR GULF MANEUVERS </p><p>WILL DO. </p><p> </p><p>13. SADDAM SAID HE FULLY BELIEVES THE USG WANTS </p><p>PEACE, AND THAT IS GOOD. BUT DO NOT, HE ASKED, </p><p>USE METHODS WHICH YOU SAY YOU DO NOT LIKE, </p><p>METHODS LIKE ARM-TWISTING- </p><p> </p><p>14. AT THIS POINT SADDAM SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT </p><p>PRIDE OF IRAQIS, WHO BELIEVE IN "LIBERTY OR DEATH." </p><p>IRAQ WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IF THE U.S. USES THESE </p><p>METHODS. IRAQ KNOWS THE USG CAN SEND PLANES AND </p><p>ROCKETS AND HURT IRAQ DEEPLY. SADDAM ASKS THAT </p><p>THE USG NOT FORCE IRAQ TO THE POINT OF HUMILIATION </p><p>AT WHICH LOGIC MUST BE DISREGARDED. IRAQ DOES NOT </p><p>CONSIDER THE U.S. AN ENEMY AND HAS TRIED TO BE </p><p>FRIENDS. </p><p> </p><p>15. AS FOR THE INTRA-ARAB DISPUTES, SADDAM SAID </p><p>HE IS NOT ASKING THE USG TO TAKE UP ANY PARTICULAR </p><p>ROLE SINCE THE SOLUTIONS MUST COME THROUGH ARAB </p><p>AND BILATERAL DIPLOMACY. </p><p> </p><p>16. RETURNING TO HIS THEME THAT IRAQ WANTS </p><p>DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AS WELL AS FRIENDSHIP WITH THE </p><p>U.S., HE CHARGED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR THERE WERE </p><p>MANY OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WHICH MADE IT SEEM THAT </p><p>THE U.S. DOES NOT WANT TO RECIPROCATE. HOW, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SADDAM ASKED,CAN WE INTERPRET THE </p><p>INVITATION FOR ARENS TO VISIT AT A TIME OF CRISIS </p><p>IN THE GULF? WHY DID THE U.S- DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>MAKE "INFLAMMATORY" STATEMENTS? </p><p> </p><p>17. SADDAM SAID THAT THE IRAQIS KNOW WHAT </p><p>WAR IS, WANT NO MORE OF IT--"DO NOT PUSH US TO IT; </p><p>DO NOT MAKE IT THE ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH WHICH WE </p><p>CAN PROTECT OUR DIGNITY." </p><p> </p><p>18. PRESIDENT BUSH, SADDAM SAID, HAS MADE NO MISTAKE </p><p>IN HIS PRESIDENCY VIS-A-VIS THE ARABS. THE DECISION </p><p>ON THE PLO DIALOGUE WAS "MISTAKEN," BUT IT WAS </p><p>TAKEN UNDER "ZIONIST PRESSURE" AND, SADDAM SAID, IS </p><p>PERHAPS A CLEVER TACTIC TO ABSORB THAT PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>19. AFTER A SHORT DIVERSION ON THE NEED FOR THE </p><p>U.S. TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF 200,000 </p><p>ARABS WITH THE SAME VIGOR AND INTEREST AS THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE ISRAELIS, SADDAM CONCLUDED BY </p><p>RESTATING THAT IRAQ WANTS AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP </p><p>"ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT PANT FOR IT, WE WILL DO OUR </p><p>PART AS FRIENDS." </p><p> </p><p>20. SADDAM THEN OFFERED AN ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE </p><p>HIS POINT. HE HAD TOLD THE IRAQI KURDISH LEADER </p><p>IN 1974 THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HALF OF </p><p>THE SHATT AL-ARAB TO IRAN TO OBTAIN ALL OF A </p><p>PROSPEROUS IRAQ. THE KURD HAD BET THAT SADDAM WOULD </p><p>NOT GIVE HALF THE SHATT--THE KURD WAS WRONG. EVEN </p><p>NOW, THE ONLY REAL ISSUE WITH IRAN IS THE SHATT, AND </p><p>IF GIVING AWAY HALF OF THE WATERWAY IS THE ONLY </p><p>THING STANDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND </p><p>IRAQI PROSPERITY, SADDAM SAID HE WOULD BE GUIDED </p><p>BY WHAT HE DID IN 1974. </p><p> </p><p>21. THE AMBASSADOR THANKED SADDAM FOR THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH HIM SOME OF </p><p>HIS AND OUR CONCERNS. PRESIDENT BUSH, TOO, WANTS </p><p>FRIENDSHIP, AS HE HAD WRITTEN AT THE \'ID AND ON </p><p>THE OCCASION OF IRAQ\'S NATIONAL DAY. SADDAM </p><p>INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THOSE </p><p> </p><p>22. AMBASSADOR RESUMED HER THEME, RECALLING THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT HAD INSTRUCTED HER TO BROADEN AND </p><p>DEEPEN OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAQ. SADDAM HAD REFERRED </p><p>TO "SOME CIRCLES" ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT AIM. SUCH </p><p>CIRCLES CERTAINLY EXISTED, BUT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION </p><p>IS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT CONTROL THE AMERICAN PRESS; </p><p>IF HE DID, CRITICISM OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT </p><p>EXIST. SADDAM AGAIN INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THAT. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD SEEN THE DIANE </p><p>SAWYER SHOW AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CHEP AND UNFAIR. </p><p>BUT THE AMERICAN PRESS TREATS ALL POLITICIANS </p><p>WITHOUT KID GLOVES--THAT IS OUR WAY. </p><p> </p><p>23. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>VERY RECENTLY REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE FOR A BETTER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND HAS PROVEN THAT BY, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>OPPOSING SANCTIONS BILLS. HERE SADDAM INTERRUPTED </p><p>AGAIN. LAUGHING, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING LEFT </p><p>FOR IRAQ TO BUY IN THE U.S. EVERYTHING IS </p><p>PROHIBITED EXCEPT FOR WHEAT, AND NO DOUBT THAT WILL </p><p>SOON BE DECLARED A DUAL-USE ITEM- SADDAM SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>HE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE, BUT RATHER </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES AT HAND. </p><p> </p><p>24. AMBASSADOR SAID THERE WERE MANY ISSUES HE </p><p>HAD RAISED SHE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON, BUT </p><p>SHE WISHED TO USE HER LIMITED TIME WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO STRESS FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DESIRE </p><p>FOR FRIENDSHIP AND, SECOND, HIS STRONG DESIRE, SHARED </p><p>WE ASSUME BY IRAQ, FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE MID </p><p>EAST. IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO BE CONCERNED </p><p>WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER BOTH </p><p>SAY PUBLICLY THAT KUWAITI ACTIONS ARE THE </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF MILITARY AGGRESSION, AND THEN WE </p><p>LEARN THAT MANY UNITS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD </p><p>HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER? IS IT NOT REASONABLE </p><p>FOR US TO ASK, IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP, NOT </p><p>CONFRONTATION, THE SIMPLE QUESTION: WHAT ARE YOUR </p><p>INTENTIONS? </p><p> </p><p>25. SADDAM SAID THAT WAS INDEED A REASONABLE </p><p>QUESTION. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE SHOULD BE </p><p>CONCERNED FOR REGIONAL PEACE, IN FACT IT IS OUR </p><p>DUTY AS A SUPERPOWER. "BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM </p><p>(KUWAIT AND UAE) UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY WE ARE </p><p>SUFFERING." THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IS SUCH THAT </p><p>THE PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS WILL HAVE </p><p>TO BE CUT. AT THIS POINT, THE INTERPRETER AND </p><p>ONE OF THE NOTETAKERS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT. </p><p> </p><p>26. AFTER A PAUSE FOR RECUPERATION, SADDAM SAID, </p><p>IN EFFECT, BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING: WE </p><p>SENT ENVOYS, WROTE MESSAGES, ASKED FAHD TO </p><p>ARRANGE QUADRAPARTITE SUMMIT (IRAQ, SAG, UE, </p><p>KUWAIT). FAHD SUGGESTFD OIL MINISTERS INSTEAD AND </p><p>WE AGREED TO THE JEDDAH AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH IT WAS </p><p>WELL BELOW OUR HOPES. THEN, SADDAM CONTINUED, </p><p>TWO DAYS LATER THE KUWAITI OIL MINISTER ANNOUNCED </p><p>HE WOULD WANT TO ANNUL THAT AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO </p><p>MONTHS. AS FOR THE UAE, SADDAM SAID, I BEGGED </p><p>SHAYKH ZAYID TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS (WHEN </p><p>SADDAM ENTERTAINED HIM IN MOSUL AFTER THE BAGHDAD </p><p>SUMMIT), AND ZAYID SAID JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET </p><p>BACK TO ABU DHABI. BUT THEN HIS MINISTER OF OIL </p><p>MADE "BAD STATEMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>27. AT THIS POINT, SADDAM LEFT THE ROOM TO TAKE </p><p>AN URGENT CALL FROM MUBARAK. AFTER HIS RETURN, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF HE COULD TELL HER IF </p><p>THERE HAS ANY PROGRESS IN FINDING A PEACEFUL WAY </p><p>TO DEFUSE THE DISPUTE. THIS WAS SOMETHING PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH WOULD BE KEENLY INTERESTED TO KNOW. SADDAM </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAD JUST LEARNED FROM MUBARAK THE </p><p>KUWAITIS HAVE AGREED TO NEGOTIATE. THE KUWAITI </p><p>CROWN PRINCE/PRIME MINISTER WOULD MEET IN RIYADH </p><p>WITH SADDAM\'S NUMBER TWO, IZZAT IBRAHIM, AND THEN </p><p>THE KUWAITI WOULD COME TO BAGHDAD ON SATURDAY, </p><p>SUNDAY OR, AT THE LATEST, MONDAY, JULY 30. </p><p> </p><p>28. "I TOLD MUBARAK," SADDAM SAID, THAT "NOTHING </p><p>WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE MEETING," AND NOTHING WILL </p><p>HAPPEN DURING OR AFTER THE MEETING IF THE KUWAITIS </p><p>WILL AT LAST "GIVE US SOME HOPE." </p><p> </p><p>29. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR </p><p>THIS GOOD NEWS. SADDAM THEN ASKED HER TO CONVEY </p><p>HIS WARM GREETINGS TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND TO </p><p>CONVEY HIS MESSAGE TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>30. NOTE: ON THE BORDER QUESTION, SADDAM REFERRED </p><p>TO THE 1961 AGREEMENT AND A "LINE OF PATROL" IT </p><p>HAD ESTABLISHED. THE KUWAITIS, HE SAID, HAD TOLD </p><p>MUBARAK IRAQ WAS 20 KILOMETERS "IN FRONT" OF THIS </p><p>LINE. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SHE HAD SERVED IN </p><p>KUWAIT 20 YEARS BEFORE; THEN, AS NOW, WE TOOK NO </p><p>POSITION ON THESE ARAB AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>31. COMMENT: IN THE MEMORY QF THE CURRENT </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS, SADDAM HAS NEVER SUMMONED AN </p><p>AMBASSADOR. HE IS WORRIED. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO HIS OWN POLITICAL THEORIZING </p><p>(U.S. THE SOLE MAJOR POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST), </p><p>HE NEEDS AT A MINIMUM A CORRECT RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH US FOR OBVIOUS GEOPOLITICAL REASONS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AS LONG AS HE PERCEIVES MORTAL </p><p>THREATS FROM ISRAEL AND IRAN. AMBASSADOR </p><p>BELIEVES SADDAM SUSPECTS OUR DECISION SUDDENLY </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE MANEUVERS WITH ABU DHABI IS A </p><p>HARBINGER OF A USG DECISION TO TAKE SIDES. </p><p>FURTHER, SADDAM, HIMSELF BEGINNING TO HAVE AN </p><p>INKLING OF HOW MUCH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT </p><p>THE U.S., IS APPREHENSIVE THAT WE DO NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND CERTAIN POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH </p><p>INHIBIT HIM, SUCH AS: </p><p> </p><p>--HE CANNOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>CAVING IN TO SUPERPOWER BULLYING (AS U/S HAMDUN </p><p>FRANKLY WARNED US IN LATE 1988); </p><p> </p><p>--IRAQ, WHICH LOST 100,000\'S OF CASUALTIES, IS </p><p>SUFFERING AND KUWAIT IS "MISERLY" AND "SELFISH." </p><p> </p><p>32. IT WAS PROGRESS TO HAVE SADDAM ADMIT </p><p>THAT THE USG HAS A "RESPONSIBILITY" IN THE </p><p>REGION, AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT AN </p><p>ANSWER WHEN WE ASK IRAQ\'S INTENTIONS. HIS </p><p>RESPONSE IN EFFECT THAT HE TRIED VARIOUS </p><p>DIPLOMATIC/CHANNELS BEFORE RESORTING TO </p><p>UNADULTERATED INTIMIDATION HAS AT LEAST THE </p><p>VIRTUE OF FRANKNESS. HIS EMPHASIS THAT HE </p><p>WANTS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IS SURELY SINCERE </p><p>(IRAQIS ARE SICK OF WAR), BUT THE TERMS SOUND </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SADDAM SEEMS TO WANT </p><p>PLEDGES NOW ON OIL PRICES AND PRODUCTION TO </p><p>COVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
