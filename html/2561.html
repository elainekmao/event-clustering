<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000481 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, CASC, ASEC, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST STUDENTS SHUT DOWN KATHMANDU SCHOOLS FOR </p><p>TWO DAYS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 410 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Facing the threat of violence, most educational </p><p>institutions in Kathmandu remained closed March 4 and 5 </p><p>after Maoist-affiliated students called a "school strike." </p><p>Exceptions included the Embassy-supported Lincoln School, </p><p>the British school, and a boarding school run by the Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army (RNA), which all remained open.  No Maoist- </p><p>related violence was reported in Kathmandu on the strike </p><p>days. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Several violent incidents occurred at local </p><p>schools in the run-up to the strike, however.  On March 1, </p><p>a group of about a dozen Maoists entered a private school </p><p>in central Kathmandu at mid-day and used gasoline to set </p><p>fire to a computer lab, causing at least USD 25,000 in </p><p>damage.  While fleeing the scene, the vandals reportedly </p><p>yelled out calls to obey their March 4-5 strike.  Press </p><p>reports quote police officials saying the school may have </p><p>been targeted because of its links to a university in </p><p>Sikkim, India.  On the same day, a business school in an </p><p>adjacent neighborhood was attacked in a similar fashion. </p><p>Three computers and a photocopier were destroyed in that </p><p>incident.  Post was unable to determine whether, as seems </p><p>likely, the attacks were carried out by the same gang. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Also on March 1, Maoists pamphleting at a local </p><p>college stabbed and critically wounded a student leader </p><p>affiliated with the Nepali Congress Party.  Post also </p><p>received reports of physical assaults on two school </p><p>principals and threatening letters and phone calls to </p><p>schools. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Mainstream student groups issued public </p><p>denunciations of the school strike.  In the past, the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated students have denounced the government\'s </p><p>decision to charge fees for primary school education and </p><p>have called for reductions in other school fees. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Note:  The EAC met and provided input to the </p><p>Lincoln School director.  She then made an independent </p><p>determination that there was no threat and the school </p><p>remained open.  As a precaution, RSO arranged for </p><p>additional police protection at the school.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: The Maoists have once again shown that </p><p>they have no qualms about targeting children.  They have </p><p>conscripted or pressed into service children in remote </p><p>areas, and by targeting educational institutions in </p><p>Kathmandu they are limiting opportunities for young people </p><p>in urban Nepal.  Their behavior in the run-up to the </p><p>strike shows that they will continue to resort to threats, </p><p>vandalism, assault and murder to get their way - even in </p><p>broad daylight.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
