<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 COLOMBO 02434 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR NEA/INS - JBARNES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP, PREL, PGOV, PINR, PINS, PTER, CE, IN </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE LTTE? </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A)  COLOMBO 2392;  (B)  COLOMBO 2052; </p><p>       (C)  COLOMBO 1957 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT </p><p>OF THE 1989 POST REPORTING PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SUMMARY:  THERE IS STILL STRONG SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) </p><p>AMONG THE 1.5 MILLION TAMILS IN SRI LANKA\'S </p><p>NORTH AND EAST, WHO SEE THE TIGERS AS THE </p><p>DEFENDERS OF LEGITIMATE TAMIL MINORITY RIGHTS. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS WIDE AGREEMENT AMONG </p><p>LTTE SUPPORTERS AND DETRACTORS THAT THE TIME </p><p>HAS COME FOR THE TIGERS TO LAY ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS </p><p>AND PURSUE THEIR OBJECTIVES THROUGH DEMOCRATIC </p><p>MEANS.  POLITICALLY, THE LTTE\'S STILL DEEP </p><p>RESERVOIR OF SUPPORT IS LITTLE THREATENED </p><p>BY INDIA\'S THREE TAMIL MILITANT ALLIES.  THE </p><p>MORE HARDLINE EELAM REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF STUDENTS (EROS) OWES MUCH OF ITS NEW- </p><p>FOUND POPULARITY TO ITS CLOSE ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH THE LTTE, AND THROUGH THIS GROUP THE LTTE </p><p>MAY BE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO MODERATE ITS </p><p>STANCE.  MILITARILY, THE LTTE HAS BEEN WEAKENED </p><p>BY 18 MONTHS OF FIGHTING THE IPKF.  YET IT </p><p>CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NEW RECRUITS AND IT </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE THE MEANS OF CONTINUING TO </p><p>ACQUIRE ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  THE STRONG </p><p>CONVICTIONS OF THE LTTE LEADERS AND THEIR </p><p>DISTRUST OF INDIAN MOTIVES HAVE MUCH TO DO </p><p>WITH THE GROUP\'S INTRANSIGENCE.  THERE ARE, </p><p>HOWEVER, INDICATIONS THAT THE LTTE WOULD </p><p>AGAIN LIKE TO NEGOTIATE.  IN THE VIEW OF THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING MAJORITY  OF TAMILS IN THE NORTH </p><p>EAST WITH HHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN, TALKS WITH </p><p>THE TIGERS OFFER THE BEST HOPE OF FORGING </p><p>A LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) </p><p>STILL HAVE STRONG SUPPORT AMONG THE 1.5 MILLION </p><p>TAMILS IN SRI LANKA\'S NORTH AND EAST, WHERE </p><p>THEY ARE SEEN AS FIGHTERS IN A LEGITIMATE </p><p>STRUGGLE FOR TAMIL MINORITY RIGHTS.  NOT ALL </p><p>WHO SUPPORT THE GROUP AGREE WITH ITS SINGLE- </p><p>MINDED INSISTENCE ON A SEPARATE STATE, BUT </p><p>FEW TAKE ISSUE WITH ITS DECISION TO TAKE UP </p><p>ARMS, AND THERE IS STRONG SYMPATHY FOR LTTE </p><p>MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DIE </p><p>FOR A CAUSE MOST BELIEVE IS JUST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>        ------------------------------- </p><p>        SUPPORT STRONGEST IN THE NORTH, </p><p>            SIGNIFICANT IN THE EAST </p><p>        ------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  LTTE SUPPORT IS MOST EVIDENT IN JAFFNA </p><p>AND THE NORTHERN WANNI, WHERE LARGE NUMBERS </p><p>OF THE POPULACE KNOW OF THE LTTE CADRES\' </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND CONCEAL THEIR KNOWLEDGE FROM </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES.  "OUTSIDE THE TOWNS (IN THE </p><p>WANNI) THEY\'RE EVERYWHERE", JAFFNA MUNICIPAL </p><p>COMMISSIONER AND NEWLY APPOINTED KILINOCHCHI </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENT ANTON ALFRED SAID.  "THE PEOPLE </p><p>BRING THEM FOOD, AND SHELTER THE LTTE CADRES", </p><p>HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN TRINCOMALEE AND BATTICALOA IN THE FORMER </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCE, THE INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE </p><p>(IPKF) AND ITS TAMIL MILITANT ALLIES, THE </p><p>EELAM PEOPLE\'S REVOLUTIONARY LIBERATION FRONT </p><p>(EPRLF), THE TAMIL EELAM LIBERATION ORGANIZATION </p><p>(TELO), AND THE EELAM NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>LIBERATION FRONT (ENDLF), HAVE KILLED MANY </p><p>LTTE CADRES AND DRIVEN MANY MORE FROM THE TOWNS </p><p>INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE.  YET THERE, TOO, SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE LTTE IS STILL THE NORM.  ALFRED </p><p>ADDED THAT MEMBERS OF THE EPRLF-DOMINATED </p><p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT HEADQUARTERED IN </p><p>TRINCOMALEE CANNOT MOVE OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN </p><p>FOR FEAR OF LTTE AMBUSH. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE  TIGERS HAVE PARTICULARLY STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT AMONG THE "UNDER-4O" AGE GROUP.  BUT </p><p>THERE IS ALSO SYMPATHY FOR THE LTTE AMONG OLDER </p><p>PERSONS WHO HAVE SEEN HOPES FOR THEIR CHILDREN </p><p>DISAPPOINTED, DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ATTRIBUTE </p><p>TO SINHALA-CHAUVINIST POLICIES OF SUCCESSIVE </p><p>POST-INDEPENDENCE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENTS. </p><p>ONE SIGNIFICANT BLOCK OF DETRACTORS THE LTTE </p><p>HAS AMONG TAMILS IN THE NORTH AND EAST ARE THE </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS AND FELLOW CADRES OF THE ESTIMATED </p><p>700 RIVAL TAMIL MILITANTS THE LTTE HAS KILLED </p><p>SINCE 1986. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>          -------------------------- </p><p>          LITTLE THREAT TO POTENTIAL </p><p>              ELECTORAL STRENGTH </p><p>          -------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL ELECTORAL  SUPPORT, </p><p>THE LTTE\'S DOMINANT POSITION IS LITTLE THREATENED </p><p>BY THE THREE MILITANT GROUPS INDIA HAS SOUGHT </p><p>TO INSTALL AS AN ALTERNATIVE TAMIL LEADERSHIP. </p><p>IN JAFFNA, WHERE 2,000 CIVILIAN DEATHS AT THE </p><p>HANDS OF THE IPKF DURING ITS OCTOBER 1987 </p><p>OFFENSIVE HAVE LEFT DEEP SCARS, MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>EPRLF, TELO AND ENDLF ARE WIDELY THOUGHT OF AS </p><p>TRAITORS.  AND IN THE EAST, WHERE A LARGER </p><p>MEASURE OF GRASSROOTS SUPPORT EXISTS FOR THESE </p><p>GROUPS, THE INABILITY OF THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT CHANGE, AND THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S APPARENT INDIFFERENCE TO THE </p><p>EPRLF\'S CALL FOR A POSTPONEMENT OF THE JULY 5 </p><p>REFERENDUM ON THE MERGER OF THE NORTH AND </p><p>EAST IS UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND </p><p>EPRLF MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  LEADERS OF THE EPRLF, TELO, THE EELAM </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF STUDENTS (EROS), AND </p><p>THE HARDLINE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF TAMIL EELAM (PLOTE), HAVE PRIVATELY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE LTTE\'S POPULARITY.  AS EPRLF </p><p>COLOMBO SPOKESMAN "WILSON" TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY, </p><p>IF THE LTTE CONTESTED AN ELECTION IN THE NORTH </p><p>AND EAST TOMORROW, "THEY WOULD WIN EASILY". </p><p>HIS STATEMENT WAS CONTRADICTED BY FEW OF THE </p><p>MANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS, </p><p>MILITANTS AND CITIZENS OF THE NORTH AND EAST </p><p>INTERVIEWED FOR THIS REPORT OVER THE FIRST THREE </p><p>MONTHS OF 1989. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>            ----------------------- </p><p>            VOTERS "SENT A MESSAGE" </p><p>                  TO THE LTTE </p><p>            ----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  AT THE SAME TIME, SUPPORT FOR THE LTTE\'S </p><p>HARDLINE EELAMIST STANCE IS DECLINING.  POCKETS </p><p>OF SUPPORT FOR THIS POLICY EXIST, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AMONG STUDENTS AND THE YOUNG ADULT UNEMPLOYED </p><p>OF THE JAFFNA PENINSULA.  BUT BY AND LARGE, </p><p>MOST PERSONS WE TALKED TO WOULD LIKE TO SEE </p><p>THE LTTE PUT ASIDE VIOLENCE AND PURSUE ITS </p><p>STRUGGLE THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THAT WAS THE MESSAGE OF THE STRONG SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE EROS SLATE IN THE FEBRUARY 15 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>VOTING, IN WHICH 13 EROS CANDIDATES (SOME OF </p><p>THEM CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LTTE) WERE </p><p>ELECTED, EROS GENERAL SECRETARY VELUPILLAI </p><p>BALAKUMAR TOLD POLOFF.  "IT WAS NOT AN LTTE </p><p>VOTE, AND IT WAS NOT AN EROS VOTE", BALAKUMAR </p><p>SAID.  "IT WAS A VOTE FOR PEACE."  EROS\' </p><p>SUCCESS AT THE POLLS IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE </p><p>TO MANY VOTERS\' BELIEF THAT THE GROUP\'S </p><p>CANDIDATES STOOD IN PROXY FOR THE LTTE.  BUT </p><p>MANY RESIDENTS AGREED WITH BALAKUMAR\'S </p><p>ASSESSMENT, TELLING US THAT THE DESIRE TO </p><p>"SEND A MESSAGE" OF THEIR WISH FOR PEACE </p><p>CAUSED THEM TO DEFY LTTE BANS ON VOTING TO </p><p>CAST BALLOTS FEBRUARY 15 AND IN THE NOVEMBER 19, </p><p>1988, PROVINCIAL COUNCIL ELECTION IN THE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>12.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE LTTE IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO MODERATE ITS POSITION AND WIN </p><p>RENEWED NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIA THROUGH EROS. </p><p>LTTE JAFFNA POLITICAL WING LEADER "KANDASAMY" </p><p>TOLD AN EMBASSY FSN THAT THE LTTE PERMITTED EROS </p><p>TO RUN AND ENCOURAGED VOTING IN THE FINAL DAYS </p><p>OF THE CAMPAIGN.  HE ALSO SAID THE LTTE DOES </p><p>NOT WISH EROS PARLIAMENTARIANS TO TAKE </p><p>THEIR SEATS UNTIL THE FIGHTING STOPS IN THE </p><p>NORTH AND EAST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  ------------------------------------------ </p><p>  POTENT MILITARY FORCE, OR "NUISANCE VALUE" </p><p>                  TERRORISTS? </p><p>  ------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE LTTE\'S CURRENT MILITARY CAPABILITY IS </p><p>HARDER TO ASSESS.  SRI LANKAN MILITARY OFFICIALS, </p><p>SUPPORTERS  OF THE LTTE AND MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION TEND TO DESCRIBE THE GROUP AS A STILL </p><p>POTENT FIGHTING FORCE, AMPLY ARMED, AND CONTINUALLY </p><p>REINFORCED BY NEW RECURITS.  INDIAN MILITARY </p><p>OFFICIALS AND LEADERS OF RIVAL MILITANT GROUPS, </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, TELL US THAT THE LTTE IS </p><p>A "SPENT" MILITARY FORCE INCAPABLE OF MORE THAN </p><p>"NUISANCE VALUE TERRORISM" AND ATTACKS ON </p><p>"SOFT TARGETS", LIKE SINHALESE VILLAGES IN </p><p>TAMIL MAJORITY AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ESTIMATES OF THE TIGERS\' NUMERICAL STRENGTH </p><p>-- ITS ACTIVE FIGHTING MEMBERSHIP -- VARY </p><p>ACCORDINGLY:  FROM SRI LANKAN TRINCOMALEE </p><p>COORDINATING OFFICER BRIGADIER TILAK PARANAGAMA\'S </p><p>JANUARY ESTIMATE  OF 2,000 LTTE CADRES, TO </p><p>NORTHEAST PROVINCE CHIEF MINISTER AND EPRLF </p><p>NUMBER TWO A. VARATHARAJA PERUMAL\'S WISHFUL </p><p>"NO MORE THAN 300". </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE LTTE HAS BEEN WEAKENED BY ITS 18 </p><p>MONTHS OF FIGHTING WITH THE IPKF, ACCORDING TO </p><p>LTTE JAFFNA POLITICAL WING LEADER "KANDASAMY". </p><p>IPKF OFFENSIVES AT NITTIKAIKULAM, MULLAITTIVU, </p><p>IN AUGUST 1988 AND MARCH 1989 ACCOUNTED FOR </p><p>MORE THAN A SCORE OF TIGER DEATHS, HE SAID. </p><p>BUT, HE ADDED, NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF 50 OR </p><p>MORE LTTE CADRE HAVING BEEN KILLED IN EACH </p><p>OFFENSIVE ARE INACCURATE.  THE LTTE HAS THE </p><p>WILL, THE MEN AND THE MATERIEL TO FIGHT ON, </p><p>KANDASAMY ASSERTED.  IN FACT, SAID KANDASAMY, </p><p>THE LTTE HAS FORMED A 500-MEMBER "SUICIDE SQUAD" </p><p>AND IS PLANNING TO STEP UP ATTACKS  AGAINST </p><p>INDIAN FORCES IF THE LATEST IPKF OFFENSIVE </p><p>DOES NOT ABATE.  (EMBASSY COMMENT:  KANDASAMY\'S </p><p>ASSERTION COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED; </p><p>HOWEVER, LOCAL NEWSPAPERS THIS WEEK AND LAST </p><p>ARE REPORTING A HIGHER THAN USUAL LEVEL OF LTTE </p><p>ACTIVITY AGAINST THE IPKF IN THE WANNI JUNGLES. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>            ----------------- </p><p>            READY RECRUITS AND </p><p>                   GUNS </p><p>            ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  A.J. CANAGARATNA (PROTECT), A LECTURER IN </p><p>ENGLISH AT JAFFNA UNIVERSITY, FORMER DEPUTY EDITOR </p><p>OF THE PRO-LTTE "SATURDAY REVIEW", AND UNTIL ABOUT </p><p>A YEAR AGO, THE MAN WHO WROTE ENGLISH LANGUAGE </p><p>POLICY STATEMENTS AND PRESS RELEASES FOR THE </p><p>LTTE IN JAFFNA, SAID LTTE CADRES ARE PRESENT </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE JAFFNA PENINSULA.  THEY OPERATE </p><p>IN SMALL GROUPS, NEVER OF MORE THAN FIVE </p><p>PERSONS, HIDING THEIR WEAPONS AND LIVING IN </p><p>"SAFE HOUSES", MIXING WITH THE POPULACE BY DAY, </p><p>AND STALKING THE IPKF AND ITS ALLIES BY NIGHT. </p><p>ONE OF THE BIGGEST SOURCES OF NEW RECRUITS </p><p>ARE LTTE SYMPATHIZERS HOUNDED FROM THEIR HOMES </p><p>IN JAFFNA BY THE PRO-INDIA MILITANTS.  "THEY </p><p>EITHER LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR GO INTO THE JUNGLES", </p><p>CANAGARATNA SAID.  HE ADDED THAT THE LTTE GETS </p><p>NEEDED ARMS AND AMMUNITION FROM CAPTURED </p><p>IPKF STOCKS, AND BY BUYING WEAPONS SUPPLIED </p><p>BY THE INDIANS FROM MEMBERS OF THE EPRLF, </p><p>TELO AND ENDLF WHO ARE LOOKING TO MAKE EASY </p><p>MONEY.  LEADERS OF THE RIVAL, HARDLINE GROUP PLOTE </p><p>ALLEGE THAT THE LTTE IS STILL BEING SUPPLIED </p><p>FROM ABROAD, WITH THE COOPERATION OF SRI </p><p>LANKAN BUSINESSMEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>        --------------------------------- </p><p>        PRABHAKARAN:  HAUNTED BY THE DEAD </p><p>        --------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  DISTRUST OF INDIA\'S MOTIVES IN SRI LANKA </p><p>AND A FEELING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY </p><p>THEIR FORMER PATRONS SEEM TO HAVE PLAYED A </p><p>MAJOR ROLE IN HARDENING THE ATTITUDES OF THE </p><p>LTTE LEADERSHIP.  TWO SOURCES WITH FORMERLY </p><p>CLOSE LINKS TO VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE LTTE LEADER HAS REFUSED TO GIVE UP </p><p>HIS STRUGGLE FOR EELAM BECAUSE HE FEELS A </p><p>MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO COMRADES WHO HAVE </p><p>DIED FIGHTING.  BUT FORMER AIADMK FOOD </p><p>MINISTER S. RAMACHANDRAN, WHO ACTED AS FORMER TAMIL </p><p>NADU CHIEF MINISTER M.G. RAMACHANDRAN\'S CONTACT </p><p>MAN WITH THE LTTE, AND FORMER LTTE MEMBER </p><p>(NOW PLOTE POLITICAL WING PRESIDENT) D. SITHARTHAN </p><p>BOTH SAID THAT PRABHAKARAN CAN BE REASONED WITH, </p><p>AND THAT IT IS HIS SECOND-IN-COMMAND, AJIT </p><p>MAHATHIYA, WHO IS PROVING THE LEAST TRACTABLE OF </p><p>ANY OF THE LTTE LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  OTHERS, CITING PRABHAKARAN\'S AUGUST 1987 </p><p>JAFFNA SPEECH FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE </p><p>ACCORD, SAY THAT HE HAS NEVER RELINQUISHED HIS </p><p>QUEST FOR A SEPARATE STATE.  SITHARTHAN </p><p>SAID THAT INDIA HAD ERRED IN THINKING IT </p><p>COULD "BUY" PRABHAKARAN WITH AN OFFER SHORT OF </p><p>EELAM.  AND EPRLF SPOKESMAN WILSON SAID </p><p>PRABHAKARAN\'S SINGLE-MINDED ATTITUDE STILL </p><p>DRIVES THE LTTE BECAUSE OF ITS TOTALITARIAN </p><p>STRUCTURE, PRABHAKARAN\'S RUTHLESS SUPPRESSION </p><p>OF DISSENT, AND THE "CULT FOLLOWING" THAT HAS </p><p>GROWN UP AROUND THE TIGERS\' NUMBER ONE.  STILL </p><p>OTHERS SAY THAT THE LTTE FEARS REPRISAL AT </p><p>THE HANDS OF THE RIVAL MILITANT GROUPS INDIAN </p><p>CONTINUES TO ARM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>         --------------------------- </p><p>         LTTE MAY AGAIN BE READY FOR </p><p>                   TALKS </p><p>         --------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, INDICATIONS THAT THE </p><p>LTTE WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO NEGOTIATE WITH INDIA. </p><p>FORMER LTTE PROPAGANDA MAN CANAGARATNA SAID </p><p>THE RIFT BETWEEN PRABHAKARAN, WHO NOW FAVORS </p><p>COMPROMISE, AND MAHATHIYA, WHO WANTS TO KEEP </p><p>FIGHTING, HAS WIDENED.  HE AND LTTE JAFFNA </p><p>POLITICAL LEADER KANDASAMY SAID THAT THE LTTE </p><p>IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT SOMETHING SHORT OF A SEPARATE </p><p>STATE AND THAT IT WANTS A CEASEFIRE AND </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIA.  BUT, SAID KANDASAMY, </p><p>THE LTTE BELIEVES INDIA IS RESISTING TALKS </p><p>AND PURSUING THE MILITARY OPTION AGAINST THE </p><p>TIGERS IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN ITS CLIENT GROUPS </p><p>AND INSURE ITS OWN FUTURE INFLUENCE IN THE </p><p>NORTH AND EAST.  THE CEASEFIRE IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>FIRST CONDITION TO THE TIGERS, BECAUSE PRABHAKARAN </p><p>REPORTEDLY WANTS NO REPETITION OF THE FIASCO OF </p><p>THE LAST ROUND OF TALKS IN WHICH "JOHNNY", THE </p><p>LTTE EMISSARY BROUGHT FROM MADRAS BY THE INDIANS </p><p>TO MEET PRABHAKARAN, WAS SHOT DEAD BY THE IPKF </p><p>IN THE WANNI.  NOR, IT IS SAID, DOES HE WANT </p><p>TO EXPOSE HIS CADRES TO ATTACK BY THE EPRLF, </p><p>TELO, ENDLF AND PLOTE. </p><p> </p><p>              --------------- </p><p>              EMBASSY COMMENT </p><p>              --------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  FOR THOSE CONCERNED WITH HOW DURABLE A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE SRI LANKAN COMMUNAL CONFLICT </p><p>CAN BE FORGED IN THE NORTH AND EAST, ONE GOOD </p><p>MEASURE MIGHT BE TO ASSESS NOW ACCEPTABLE IT IS </p><p>TO THE PEOPLE IT WILL MOST DIRECTLY AFFECT. </p><p>IN THE VIEW OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF </p><p>TAMILS IN THE NORTH AND EAST WITH WHOM WE HAVE </p><p>SPOKEN IN RECENT MONTHS, THERE CAN BE NO LASTING </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF THE LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>21.  SUPPORT FOR THE LTTE IS NOT GOING TO </p><p>DISAPPEAR SOON.  THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OF POPULAR </p><p>SYMPATHY FROM THE LTTE TO THE THREE GROUPS </p><p>INDIAHAS TRIED TO INSTALL AS AN ALTERNATIVE. </p><p>AND EFFORTS TO IMPOSE A "MILITARY SOLUTION", </p><p>WHICH INEVITABLY RESULT IN CIVILIAN DEATH, </p><p>HAVE IN THE PAST TENDED TO HARDEN ATTITUDES </p><p>AND BROADEN THE TIGERS\' POPULAR BASE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  MANY BELIEVE THAT THE LTTE IS ENCOURAGING </p><p>EROS\' EFFORTS AT MEDIATION, AND SEE IN THIS </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT THE TIGER LEADERSHIP HAS </p><p>DECIDED ON THE NEED FOR A CHANGE OF TACK. </p><p>THEY BELIEVE, WITH EROS\' BALAKUMAR, THAT THE LTTE </p><p>"IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO SAVE FACE" AND MODERATE </p><p>ITS STANCE.  THERE IS NO GREAT OPTIMISM </p><p>ON THE PART OF TAMILS IN THE NORTH AND EAST </p><p>THAT THIS APPROACH WILL WORK.  BUT FEW SEE </p><p>WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE TRIED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN </p><p></p></div>
