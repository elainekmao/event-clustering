<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA, AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS REACT TO COURT\'S SUSPENSION OF KEY </p><p> REGULATORY ACTION; IMF PLANS FOR ENGAGING THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8527 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Negative Development on Banking Reform </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On November 22, Turkish press reported that Turkey\'s </p><p>supreme administrative court ("Danistay") issued a decision </p><p>to suspend the Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency\'s </p><p>(BRSA) intervention of the insolvent Pamukbank.  Under </p><p>Turkish law, the bank will now be handed back to its former </p><p>owner Cukurova Holding (also the controlling shareholder of </p><p>Yapi Kredi Bank), pending final resolution of the court case. </p><p> We contacted BRSA staff, but they like us had only seen </p><p>press reports and refrained from comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Pamukbank was taken over by BRSA on June 19, </p><p>following independent bank audits which revealed a capital </p><p>deficiency of about $2 billion.  Presumably, Cukurova Holding </p><p>will now be given a second chance to recapitalize the bank </p><p>(and repay the BRSA for funds it has injected after taking </p><p>over the bank); if it cannot do so (as it couldn\'t in June), </p><p>presumably the bank will be returned to the BRSA.  The </p><p>court\'s suspension of Pamukbank intervention will also affect </p><p>the fate of sister Yapi Kredi Bank, since Pamuk had owned 10 </p><p>percent of Yapi\'s shares, which together with other Pamuk </p><p>assets had been transferred to the BRSA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Initial market reaction to the court decision was </p><p>negative: the lira depreciated 0.75 percent (to TL 1,590,000 </p><p>per dollar), and T-bill yields rose about 1 percentage point </p><p>(to 52.5 compounded).  JP Morgan/Chase treasurer told us at </p><p>mid-day that the initial damage appeared to be limited, "but </p><p>if this becomes a deal-breaker for the IMF, watch out." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Plans </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Earlier in the day, IMF resrep (protect) briefed us </p><p>on plans to engage the new GOT.  In a long meeting November </p><p>21 evening with State Minister Babacan, resrep pushed for the </p><p>IMF mission to begin right after the end of the Ramadan </p><p>holiday, on December 9, and continue for two weeks.  The </p><p>mission would be preceded by a December 2-4 visit to Ankara </p><p>by IMF Europe Director Deppler and Mission Chief Kahkonen, to </p><p>meet the new ministers.  After checking with PM Gul, Babacan </p><p>accepted this plan.  IMF resrep believes that a further IMF </p><p>mission will be needed in early January to wrap up the Fourth </p><p>Review (which includes reaching agreement on 2003 macro </p><p>targets). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IMF resrep said his instructions were to tell Babacan </p><p>that three elements of the program were "non-negotiable": </p><p>the 6.5 percent of GNP primary budget surplus; BRSA </p><p>independence; Central Bank independence.  On BRSA </p><p>independence, IMF resrep added that there was "an important </p><p>test case in the Fourth Review" (resolution of Yapi Kredi\'s </p><p>ownership).  He said that Babacan replied, "we\'ve discussed </p><p>this case and it will not be a problem."  (Note:  This was </p><p>before the November 22 Danistay decision.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Today\'s decision on Pamukbank, if not reversed, will </p><p>create new uncertainties in the market, and increase risks in </p><p>the banking system.  We still need to learn details of the </p><p>court decision.  But a senior banker, Kocbank CEO Karacaham, </p><p>told us he believes Cukurova Holding will try to recapitalize </p><p>Pamukbank (and perhaps Yapi Kredi) by revaluing shares in the </p><p>group\'s telecom company Turkcell, held by the banks as </p><p>collateral for loans to their owner.  Such a ploy would leave </p><p>two large unhealthy players in the banking system, who would </p><p>find it difficult to borrow internationally, and could </p><p>present a large fiscal risk to the GOT.  These two banks\' </p><p>combined deposits (100 percent guaranteed by the government) </p><p>are over $10 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The new government\'s commitment to banking reform </p><p>will come under heightened scrutiny, in light of criticism of </p><p>the BRSA by AK during the campaign and this decision to roll </p><p>back a key regulatory action. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
