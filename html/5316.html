<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING SENT 21 JAN 03 BEING REPEATED FOR YOUR </p><p>ACTION/INFO: QUOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L NEW DELHI 000386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2003 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, EAGR, IN </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (WTO) MENON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) NEW DELHI 273 B) STATE 8444 C) 02 STATE 265619 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR ROBERT RAPSON. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  ECON M/C CALLED ON COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTRY </p><p>ADDITIONAL SECRETARY S.N. MENON ON JANUARY 21.  MENON IS THE </p><p>SENIOR-MOST OFFICIAL AT THE MINISTRY WITH RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>FOR WTO AND THE EU.  ECON M/C REVIEWED A NUMBER OF ISSUES </p><p>WITH MENON INCLUDING: OUR WTO AGRICULTURAL AND EXPORT CREDIT </p><p>PROPOSALS, THE US TRIPS MORATORIUM PROPOSAL, WTO </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ON EU BIOTECH MORATORIUM, AND PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>ACTING COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER SHOURIE AND AMBASSADOR </p><p>ZOELLICK TO MEET IN THE COMING WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WTO AGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ECON M/C BRIEFED MENON ON KEY POINTS OF THE US </p><p>EXPORT CREDITS PROPOSAL AND OUR CRITIQUE OF THE EC\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PROPOSAL.  ALTHOUGH EVINCING FAMILIARITY WITH </p><p>THE US AND EC POSITIONS ON AGRICULTURE, MENON EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE OVERVIEW AND RELATED NON-PAPERS, BOTH OF </p><p>WHICH HE SAID THEY WOULD STUDY CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) MENON NOTED THAT INDIA\'S POSITION ON AGRICULTURE, A </p><p>FORMAL SUBMISSION OF WHICH WILL BE MADE IN GENEVA ON FEBRUARY </p><p>22, PROVIDES FOR LITTLE FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO MARKET </p><p>ACCESS.  INDIA WILL LOOK FOR URUGUAY ROUND-LEVEL REDUCTIONS </p><p>ONLY AND WILL INSIST ON SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT, </p><p>INCLUDING SPECIAL SAFEGUARDS AND PROTECTIONS UNDER THE "FOOD </p><p>SECURITY" BOX. HE SAID THAT INDIAN POLITICIANS AND DOMESTIC </p><p>FARM GROUPS ARE FIRM ON THIS POINT.  THE GOI WILL "DIG-IN AND </p><p>STAND" ON THIS ISSUE AS NECESSARY, HE ADDED.  REINFORCING THE </p><p>POINT, MENON CITED A GOI INTERNAL STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT 165 </p><p>MILLION INDIANS AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS ARE COMPLETELY </p><p>DEPENDENT ON 33 "SENSITIVE" CROPS.  MENON THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY </p><p>THERE WOULD BE MEANINGFUL REDUCTIONS OF INDIAN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>TARIFFS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. BEFORE INDIA COULD EVEN </p><p>CONSIDER THE KINDS OF AGRICULTURAL SECTOR REFORMS </p><p>CONTEMPLATED BY THE US (AND EVEN THE EC), INDIA WOULD NEED TO </p><p>KNOW "ACTUAL REDUCTIONS" BY THE US AND EU OF EXPORT </p><p>SUBSIDIES, DOMESTIC SUPPORTS, AND TARIFFS. HE ADDED THAT </p><p>INDIA DOES NOT WANT AN OVERLY AMBITIOUS AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM </p><p>IN THE DOHA ROUND AND IS FEARFUL THAT THE US AND EC WILL CUT </p><p>A DEAL AT THE END THAT LEAVES OTHERS LEFT OUT AND </p><p>DISADVANTAGED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MENON NOTED THAT INDIAN AGRICULTURAL MINISTER AJIT </p><p>SINGH IS CURRENTLY IN GENEVA FOR DISCUSSIONS.  SINGH WILL </p><p>ALSO BE TRAVELING TO TOKYO FOR THE WTO MINI-MINISTERIAL O/A </p><p>FEBRUARY 14-15. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRIPS MORATORIUM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  MENON CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED AND STUDIED </p><p>USTR\'S PROPOSAL FOR A TRIPS MORATORIUM AND CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>THEY COULD NOT SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVE AS IT WAS "NOT ENOUGH" </p><p>TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  MENON SUGGESTED THAT FURTHER THOUGHT </p><p>BE GIVEN TO FINDING A CREATIVE SOLUTION TO BREAK THE IMPASSE. </p><p> HE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO EXPLORE WAYS OF </p><p>ACCOMPLISHING THIS WITH USDEL AND OTHERS IN GENEVA. ECON M/C </p><p>URGED MENON TO BE FORTHCOMING WITH ANY CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS </p><p>THEY MIGHT HAVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU BIOTECH MORATORIUM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  IN RESPONSE TO ECON M/C\'S PRESENTATION, MENON </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE GOI SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM, IN PRINCIPLE, </p><p>IN SUPPORTING AND/OR JOINING WITH US AND OTHERS FOR </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN THE WTO ON THE EU\'S  MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS </p><p>FOR BIOTECH AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. MENON SAID HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO CONFIRM THIS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY, WHICH HAS THE </p><p>LEAD WITHIN THE GOI ON BIOTECH ISSUES, AND WITH THEIR </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE WTO IN GENEVA, AND WOULD GET BACK TO US </p><p>WITHIN A WEEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZOELLICK-SHOURIE MEETING? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) MENON REITERATED THE MINISTRY\'S INTEREST IN </p><p>SCHEDULING A MEETING BETWEEN ACTING-COMMERCE MINISTER SHOURIE </p><p>AND USTR ZOELLICK ON THE MARGINS OF THE TOKYO WTO </p><p>MINI-MINISTERIAL, FEBRUARY 14-15.  ECON M/C SAID HE WOULD </p><p>SHARE THIS WITH USTR, WHICH IS ALREADY AWARE OF THE REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) SEPARATELY, MENON ADVISED THAT AN INVITATION WAS </p><p>EXTENDED TO USTR ZOELLICK AND EU COMMISSIONER LAMY ON JANUARY </p><p>20 TO ATTEND A GATHERING OF 15 OR SO KEY COMMONWEALTH TRADE </p><p>MINISTERS IN NEW DELHI, MARCH 15-16.  MENON SAID THE MEETING </p><p>IS NOT A "WTO MINI-MINISTERIAL, AS ERRONEOUSLY DESCRIBED IN </p><p>THE INDIAN PRESS ON JANUARY 21, BUT INSTEAD AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>FOR QUALITY INTERACTION BETWEEN KEY DOHA ROUND PLAYERS. MENON </p><p>IS PROVIDING POST A COPY OF THE JOINT GOI/CONFEDERATION OF </p><p>INDIAN INDUSTRY (CII) INVITATION WITH ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND </p><p>MATERIALS.  ACCORDING TO MENON,  CII\'S WASHINGTON OFFICE WAS </p><p>TO HAVE SENT THE INVITATION TO USTR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ECON M/C APPRISED MENON OF ACTING-MINISTER SHOURIE\'S </p><p>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST TO THE AMBASSADOR ON JANUARY 13 IN </p><p>POSSIBLY TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON IN THE MID-MARCH TO </p><p>EARLY-APRIL TIMEFRAME FOR SUBSTANTIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR ZOELLICK AND SENIOR USTR STAFF (REF A).  MENON </p><p>NOTED THAT THIS IDEA WAS STILL "ON" AS FAR AS HE UNDERSTOOD, </p><p>BUT WOULD, OF COURSE, BE CONTINGENT ON THE ACTING-MINISTER </p><p>CONTINUING TO HOLD THE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY PORTFOLIO. MENON </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE IT IS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN THAT THERE WILL BE </p><p>A CABINET RESHUFFLE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK, PREDICTIONS ABOUT </p><p>ARUN SHOURIE\'S PROSPECTS IN A NEW CABINET LINEUP ARE PURE </p><p>SPECULATION AT THIS POINT.  MENON THOUGHT THERE WAS A </p><p>REASONABLE CHANCE THAT SHOURIE WOULD STAY ON AS COMMERCE </p><p>MINISTER (SANS THE INDUSTRY PORTFOLIO), AND RELINQUISH HIS </p><p>POSITION AS DISINVESTMENT MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIBAULT   UNQUOTE </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
