<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN PAPERS REACT TO UN REPORT ON </p><p>LOOTING OF THE DRC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editorials focus on the UN report on "Illegal </p><p>      Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of </p><p>      Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)." </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Zimbabwe deserve truth on DRC </p><p>      looting" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      (10/26) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The honorable course of action for the </p><p>      Zimbabwean leaders named in the United Nations </p><p>      report on the plunder of the natural resources </p><p>      of the DRC is to step down immediately from </p><p>      their positions. . .  Only the truth can clear </p><p>      the air and until then, all of them must </p><p>      relinquish their posts. . .  The UN report </p><p>      confirms the suspicion both here and around the </p><p>      world that the whiff of scandal surrounding the </p><p>      presence of our troops in the DRC had a solid </p><p>      basis.  It is scandalous that while the official </p><p>      government propaganda was that Zimbabwe was in </p><p>      the DRC to protect the sovereignty of a fellow </p><p>      African country under siege, its leaders were </p><p>      enriching themselves illicitly by exploiting the </p><p>      natural resources of that strife-torn country. . </p><p>      ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Successful end to DRC mission" </p><p>      the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" </p><p>      (10/27) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "On Wednesday the SADC Allied Forces in the DRC </p><p>      will lower their flags at their headquarters to </p><p>      mark the last step in the triumphal withdrawal </p><p>      from the Great Lakes region after a four-year </p><p>      campaign.  No one can question the fact that </p><p>      they have achieved their mission - to preserve </p><p>      the independence and national sovereignty of a </p><p>      sister SADC country against invading forces. </p><p>      There is no doubt that it is Zimbabwe and its </p><p>      allies who have brought peace to the DRC and </p><p>      prevented what would certainly have been </p><p>      genocide.  But Zimbabwe\'s detractors are </p><p>      determined that it should not get the glory for </p><p>      the work it has done.  This explains why, on the </p><p>      eve of the withdrawal, Western forces led by </p><p>      Britain and the U.S. have engaged their lapdog </p><p>      media in Zimbabwe and in Europe to present </p><p>      Zimbabwe as a plunderer and not a peacemaker. </p><p>      To give the campaign credibility it has been </p><p>      presented in the form of a UN report which, when </p><p>      read closely, exposes itself as nothing but a </p><p>      consolidation of British and American </p><p>      intelligence reports. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "The politics behind the UN report </p><p>      on the DRC" the pro-government weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mirror" (10/27) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "What is being peddled in the press as `The UN </p><p>      Report\' on the DRC is actually the third in a </p><p>      series of such reports which started in the year </p><p>      2001. . .  The bottom line is that, this third </p><p>      report and final report was supposed to be an </p><p>      anti-Zimbabwe document.  The tone is very clear, </p><p>      and the authors were at pains to name Zimbabwe </p><p>      or to give the name of a Zimbabwean wherever </p><p>      possible.  There is no doubt that Zimbabweans </p><p>      were and are doing business in the DRC, and the </p><p>      Zimbabwe defense Forces involved have never </p><p>      denied it.  They are involved in mining ventures </p><p>      with the full blessing of the government of the </p><p>      DRC. . .  Why the UN experts continued to label </p><p>      declared business as looting is perhaps. . .a </p><p>      matter of ideology. . .  The UN experts are </p><p>      certainly under the spell of the new ideology </p><p>      advanced by Paul Collier which states that all </p><p>      modern African conflicts are a result not of any </p><p>      genuine political, national or regional security </p><p>      concerns, but the greed of a few African </p><p>      strongmen who want to benefit from the looting </p><p>      made possible by the occasion of war.  If </p><p>      followed logically, this argument would nullify </p><p>      all African talk of fighting for liberation, </p><p>      sovereignty, democracy and other political </p><p>      values.  All modern African struggles could then </p><p>      be reduced to nothing more than looting and </p><p>      plundering, and that indeed would be the end of </p><p>      modern African History as we know it." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
