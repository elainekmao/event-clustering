<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001983 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 25 (4/02 2000 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) AMMAN 1954 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) AMMAN 1981 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol Couns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy operated on a normal schedule 2 April. </p><p>Consular services were open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there was only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Rumors in the QIZ community allege that a closure of </p><p>the northern border crossing with Israel (Shaykh Hussain </p><p>Bridge) that began 4 days ago is related to war with Iraq. </p><p>The Embassy verified with authorities at the bridge, the </p><p>Trade Ministry, and freight forwarders that the closure is </p><p>not/not security related, but is instead the result of </p><p>strikes by government workers in Israel.  We have been in </p><p>contact with Trade Ministry officials about this issue, and </p><p>they will be contacting QIZ exporters and park managers to </p><p>assure them that the closures are not related in any way to </p><p>the war.  Trade Ministry officials caution, though, that </p><p>their Israeli counterparts predicted the strikes could </p><p>continue for some time, which would negatively impact QIZ </p><p>operations in any case. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Although volume was heavy on the Amman Stock </p><p>Exchange Wednesday, the index closed down slightly by .33%. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  IOM reports </p><p>that a total of 7 TCNs arrived from Iraq on April 1; there </p><p>have been no TCN arrivals since 1200 am today, April 2.  One </p><p>person with document problems currently is being held in </p><p>no-man\'s land at the border.  No sign of Iraqi </p><p>refugees/asylum seekers.  UNHCR reports that khamseen winds </p><p>are stirring up some sandstorms in Ruweished. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  IOM reports that current TCN transit camp population </p><p>is 279, including 66 children under the age of five.  Roughly </p><p>100 camp residents are likely to remain in Ruweished </p><p>indefinitely. This group includes the Somalis & Sudanese who </p><p>have said they don\'t want to return to their countries of </p><p>origin but have been found not to meet UNHCR criteria for </p><p>refugee status, as well as the 18 stateless Palestinians. </p><p>IOM is working with the Jordan Red Crescent Society and NGOs </p><p>to revise camp management procedures to accommodate this </p><p>group of long-term residents.  IOM is repatriating TCNs in </p><p>"dribs and drabs" on commercial flights from Amman. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  IOM/Amman confirmed that the number of total TCN </p><p>arrivals reported by IOM/Cyprus is inaccurate, as it includes </p><p>the thousands of Jordanian students who have returned from </p><p>their studies in Iraq.  According to IOM/Amman, total TCN </p><p>arrivals in Jordan since the onset of hostilities is 712, </p><p>with 444 TCNs already repatriated. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Once again, Jordanian dailies led with reports and </p><p>photos of the progress of the war.  The anti-war sentiment </p><p>continues to manifest itself through photos of civilians </p><p>killed, including children and infants.  A photo showed a man </p><p>who "lost 15 members of his family."  Al-Rai\'s headline read </p><p>that the King called for an immediate stop to the war. </p><p>Headlines and captions talked of "massacres" and called to </p><p>"save Iraqi children." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  In response to the letter by 99 personalities (ref </p><p>A), Al-Arab Al-Yawm carried a counter letter signed by 104 </p><p>personalities, expressing their total satisfaction with the </p><p>King\'s leadership (ref B).  This theme also occurred in the </p><p>commentaries of a number of writers in Al-Rai and Al-Dustour. </p><p> Nevertheless, two editorialists, Mahmoud Al-Rimawi in Al-Rai </p><p>and Fahed Al-Khitan in Al-Arab Al-Yawm wrote that the </p><p>original letter contained an accurate appraisal of the </p><p>situation, which should not be "overlooked by the decision </p><p>maker." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)   Al-Dustour reported that more than 350 Jordanian </p><p>factories have refused to deal with the amendment made to the </p><p>"oil for food" program, which takes away the authority to </p><p>manage the program from the hands of the Iraqi government and </p><p>gives it to the United Nations.  According to the press </p><p>report, representatives of the factories conveyed this stand </p><p>to the Iraqi Ambassador in Amman, stressing that they will </p><p>not sign any contracts to export to Iraq based on the </p><p>mechanism unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council a </p><p>few days ago.  An Iraqi diplomatic source told the paper that </p><p>there are important ongoing contacts between Amman and </p><p>Baghdad to prevent the implementation of this amendment. </p><p>Al-Dustour also reported that Jordan and Iraq are looking </p><p>into the possibility of transferring a big chunk of the </p><p>contracts for Jordanian companies signed under the "oil for </p><p>food" memorandum of understanding and making them part of the </p><p>Jordanian-Iraqi trade protocol. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
