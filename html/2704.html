<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, CASC, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS REPORTEDLY POSTPONE FIVE-DAY STRIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) KATHMANDU 0604 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Late in the morning of April 1, the </p><p>Embassy began to receive reports from usually reliable press </p><p>and human rights sources that the Maoists have decided to </p><p>postpone the five-day general strike, or "bandh," called for </p><p>April 2-6, to April 23-27, in response to broad-based public </p><p>discontent at the bandh\'s coinciding with national secondary </p><p>school exams.  Shortly before 5:00 p.m. local time Embassy </p><p>received a press release signed by Maoist supremo Prachanda, </p><p>originally sent to BBC, confirming the postponement.  Text of </p><p>Embassy\'s unofficial translation of the Nepali-language press </p><p>release follows in Para 6 below.  News sources generally </p><p>regard the press release and signature as authentic.  Septel </p><p>details Embassy actions following an EAC meeting and </p><p>preparations for April 2.  The insurgents\' action offers a </p><p>hopeful indication that they may sometimes be vulnerable to </p><p>coordinated public pressure, and is an encouraging--and </p><p>regrettably rare--demonstration of what well-concerted </p><p>efforts by civil society in Nepal\'s generally fractious and </p><p>self-interested political landscape can sometimes still </p><p>achieve.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Late in the morning of April 1, just one day before </p><p>the five-day national strike, or "bandh," called by the </p><p>Maoists for April 2-6, the Embassy began to receive verbal </p><p>reports from several press and human rights sources that the </p><p>Maoists had decided to postpone the bandh till April 23-27. </p><p>None of the sources contacted, however, had received anything </p><p>in writing, and many--the Embassy included--were reluctant to </p><p>take the verbal reports at face value without the typical </p><p>accompanying press release to back them up.  Others, such as </p><p>Kantipur FM radio station and the local AFP correspondent, </p><p>began to report the postponement as fact, even without </p><p>written verification. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  An editor of a vernacular daily, who first </p><p>contacted the Embassy Public Diplomacy section with news of </p><p>the cancellation, identified his source as a known Maoist </p><p>contact who had habitually supplied reliable information in </p><p>the past.  The head of a local human rights organization </p><p>described his informant in the same way, noting that the </p><p>original information had come from the Maoist leadership "in </p><p>India" to Kathmandu regional headquarters, and predicting the </p><p>verbal report would be shortly followed up by something in </p><p>writing.  Lila Mani Pokhrel, a left-wing United People\'s </p><p>Front Member of Parliament, also told assembled MPs at an </p><p>afternoon session of Parliament that he had received similar </p><p>word verbally from Maoist sources, and expected to have </p><p>written confirmation by late afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Many sources contacted generally viewed reports of </p><p>the postponement as authentic, despite the lack of written </p><p>back-up, citing coordinated protests over the past several </p><p>weeks by members of civil society, including human rights and </p><p>teachers\' groups, decrying the harmful effect of the bandh on </p><p>a broad spectrum of Nepali society--secondary school students </p><p>who have to take the compulsory national examinations, </p><p>scheduled to begin the same day as the bandh, in order to </p><p>qualify for higher education.  Subodh Raj Pyakurel, the head </p><p>of the local human rights organization INSEC, in a prominent </p><p>public statement predicted the Maoist bandh would create for </p><p>the movement thousands of sworn instant enemies throughout </p><p>the nation.  Other human rights groups followed up with </p><p>public statements calling on the Maoists to cancel the bandh, </p><p>citing the negative impact on Nepali youth from all strata of </p><p>society. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Shortly before 5:00 p.m. Embassy Public Diplomacy </p><p>section received, via a contact at BBC, a copy of the press </p><p>statement, apparently signed by Maoist supremo Prachanda. </p><p>Most media and human rights sources contacted view the </p><p>signature and press release as authentic.  Septel reports </p><p>actions taken by the Embassy EAC on operating hours April 2. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Begin text of unofficial translation of press release </p><p>from Prachanda: </p><p> </p><p>Press Release </p><p> </p><p>It is well known to all about the announcement regarding the </p><p>Nepal Bandh program from tomorrow, April 2-6, with the </p><p>objective of fostering a unified struggle against the </p><p>military dictatorship imposed by the feudal dictators, who </p><p>changed the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exam dates by </p><p>some weeks.  The conspiracy of openly attacking the political </p><p>outcome of the people\'s movement of 1990 by the feudal </p><p>dictators in order to permanently establish a military </p><p>dictatorship is plainly seen.  Not only our analysis and </p><p>conclusion from the time of the royal massacre have been </p><p>proved right, but the appeal made by us to the political </p><p>powers inside and outside of Parliament for extensive, </p><p>unified revolution against this conspiracy has also been </p><p>strongly justified.  The feudal dictators and their </p><p>supporters, who have shown insincerity and deceived the </p><p>country and the people, have continued their campaign of mass </p><p>killings and have shifted the date of the examination, </p><p>instead of providing a secure future to students.  In this </p><p>situation, our great and glorious party, CPN (Maoist), has </p><p>shifted the Nepal Bandh program, which was announced by the </p><p>party along with (other) concrete programs of the </p><p>Revolutionary People\'s Council, from April 2-6, because we </p><p>have realized our responsibility towards the future of the </p><p>students and the request made by the academic community, </p><p>parents and guardians (of students), and friendly political </p><p>parties.  We have changed the Nepal Bandh program to April </p><p>23-27.  We would like to seriously appeal as usual to all to </p><p>help make the five-day bandh a success and a positive way out </p><p>of the state of emergency.  We would like to reiterate our </p><p>commitment that we would end all such programs, if an </p><p>environment is created so that a positive political way out </p><p>can be found.  If the killings of the sons and daughters of </p><p>ordinary people continues every day, then there is no </p><p>alternative but to retaliate extensively. </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>Chairman </p><p>CPN (Maoist) </p><p>April 1, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>End text of unofficial translation of press release. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  The Maoists originally called the bandh </p><p>to coincide with the national secondary school exams, thereby </p><p>hoping to embarrass the embattled GON and increase public </p><p>dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the emergency.  But </p><p>they obviously did not count on the wide-spread outcry their </p><p>plans generated from members of Nepali society in all walks </p><p>of life.  By targeting the national secondary school exams, </p><p>the Maoists managed to strike a chord that reverberated from </p><p>the highest levels of society down to the lowest--and earned </p><p>themselves some rather negative PR coverage in the process. </p><p>That the Maoists have only postponed the bandh, rather than </p><p>outright cancelling it, is regrettable, but at least the </p><p>postponement puts the students out of the direct line of </p><p>fire.  Local human rights groups are taking credit for </p><p>pressuring the Maoists to call off the bandh.  If that is </p><p>actually the reason for the withdrawal, it offers a hopeful </p><p>indication that Maoists can be susceptible to public </p><p>pressure, and is encouraging--and rare--evidence of what </p><p>well-concerted efforts by civil society in Nepal\'s generally </p><p>fractious and self-interested political landscape can still </p><p>achieve. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
