Maoist bombs claimed the lives of at least two children </p><p>during the last two weeks, adding to the more than 100 </p><p>children reported killed by the ongoing violence.  Among </p><p>other incidents taking place during the same period, 50 </p><p>Village Development Committee offices and at least 20 post </p><p>offices were destroyed; civilians as well as soldiers were </p><p>killed and injured in petrol bomb and mine attacks on </p><p>passenger buses and other vehicles; offices of a project in </p><p>the Annapurna Conservation Area were looted and demolished; </p><p>and the King Mahendra Conservation Trust was bombed for the </p><p>second time. A small explosive device was also detonated in </p><p>the toilet of the popular Tiger Mountain travel agency. </p><p> </p><p>2. Additional violence continued throughout the nationwide </p><p>strike from November 11-13 (reftel), and Maoist leadership </p><p>has called for another "concrete program of agitation," with </p><p>dates and details to be announced. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST VIOLENCE STRIKES CHILDREN </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. A 12-year-old mentally disabled boy died instantly and </p><p>three others were seriously injured by a bomb in Banepa </p><p>Municipality, approximately 30 miles southeast of Kathmandu. </p><p>The boy was walking past a garbage heap when a bomb planted </p><p>there by Maoists exploded.  In a similar incident, a 14-year- </p><p>old boy was killed and a 10-year-old boy and their guardian </p><p>were seriously injured in an explosion as they walked to </p><p>school in western Doti district on November 13.  The boys </p><p>and their guardian were traveling by foot because of the </p><p>general strike called by the insurgents, and were injured </p><p>when a Maoist bomb detonated near the road. </p><p> </p><p>4. Nepali human rights watch group INSEC estimates that more </p><p>than 100 children have been killed since the start of the </p><p>Maoist insurgency.  According to INSEC, 62 children (38 boys </p><p>and 24 girls) have been killed by government forces, while </p><p>Maoists have killed 44 children (30 boys and 14 girls). </p><p> </p><p>REBELS DESTROY VDC OFFICES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. Maoist insurgents destroyed 25 Village Development </p><p>Committee (VDC) offices in central Gulmi district during the </p><p>weekend of November 2-3 and attacked two dozen VDCs in </p><p>Kapilbastu district on November 7, burning buildings, </p><p>records and documents. Local officials called the attack in </p><p>Kapilbastu, which borders India, the most extensive </p><p>operation ever launched in the district by the Maoists. The </p><p>Ministry of Local Development has reported that insurgents </p><p>have destroyed more than 1,300 VDC offices nationwide, </p><p>nearly one-third of all VDCs in Nepal.  The Ministry </p><p>estimates that total losses from the attacks, which also </p><p>target health posts and other government-owned </p><p>installations, amount to nearly 284 million rupees (3.6 </p><p>million USD). </p><p> </p><p>POSTAL WORKER KILLED; </p><p>MAIL SERVICE PARALYZED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. One postman was beheaded and another severely beaten by </p><p>Maoists on November 9, on suspicion of providing information </p><p>to government forces in central Makwanpur district.  Maoist </p><p>attacks on post offices have left many remote villages, </p><p>already without telephone connections, cut off from </p><p>communication with the rest of the country.  Postal workers </p><p>fear attack if they venture into remote areas to deliver </p><p>mail.  According to the Department of Postal Service (DPS), </p><p>a majority of local post offices in Nepal\'s hilly and </p><p>mountainous regions have either been destroyed by Maoists or </p><p>moved to district headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>7. Though the impact of the insurgency on postal service in </p><p>the Terai has been called "negligible" by DPS officials, </p><p>Maoists reportedly have destroyed 20 post offices in </p><p>southern Dang district in the last year as part of their </p><p>campaign to disrupt government infrastructure in the </p><p>district, which borders India.  The insurgents have </p><p>destroyed 439 post offices in total, with the mid-eastern </p><p>development region the most affected.  Damage has been </p><p>estimated at 17.1 million rupees (218,000 USD). </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DESTROY CROWDED BUS, MINE HIGHWAYS AND </p><p>LOOT PASSENGERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>8. A bus conductor and a passenger were killed and 14 others </p><p>injured when Maoists attacked a bus crowded with holiday </p><p>passengers in southern Sarlahi district on November 4.  The </p><p>bus caught fire, skidded 100 meters and flipped onto its </p><p>roof after Maoists hurled petrol bombs at the front of the </p><p>vehicle. Two days earlier, Maoists in Bara district looted </p><p>three busloads of passengers and a truck.  According to </p><p>local police, Maoists erected a barricade across a highway, </p><p>forcing the vehicles to stop.  Passengers and staff were </p><p>taken into the surrounding forest and robbed of their </p><p>belongings and cash.  The truck was looted of 270,000 rupees </p><p>(3500 USD) worth of goods.  Local police report that this is </p><p>the first case of coordinated robbery of several vehicles in </p><p>one night by Maoists in the southern district. On November </p><p>10, passengers were ordered out of a bus on its way from </p><p>Kathmandu to Biratnagar before Maoists set the vehicle and </p><p>passenger belongings ablaze. </p><p> </p><p>9. At least one person was killed and 20 others injured when </p><p>their passenger bus detonated a Maoist landmine in </p><p>northeastern Dolakha district on November 14.  Two persons </p><p>were killed instantly when their private van drove over a </p><p>mine planted by the Maoists near Birgunj along the Indian </p><p>border on November 9.  In both incidents, authorities have </p><p>speculated that the mine was intended for security forces. </p><p>Three soldiers were injured when their truck detonated a </p><p>mine planted by Maoists on the Pasang Lhamu Highway in </p><p>central Nuwakot district. </p><p> </p><p>KING MAHENDRA TRUST AND ACAP OFFICES ATTACKED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>10. On November 1, the King Mahendra Trust for Nature </p><p>Conservation was bombed for the second time, injuring one </p><p>person and causing minor damage to the Kathmandu office. </p><p>The Trust is chaired by Crown Prince Paras. </p><p> </p><p>11. On November 8, Maoists looted and destroyed the offices </p><p>of an Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) in </p><p>Ghandruk, situated on the route to the Annapurna Base Camp. </p><p>The ACAP office was approached by 40-50 Maoists, who looted </p><p>the building of computers and other electronic equipment </p><p>before burning it to the ground.  ACAP, which is a </p><p>subsidiary of KMTNC, is chiefly concerned with the </p><p>conservation of culture and national heritage. </p><p> </p><p>SMALL BOMB EXPLODES IN TIGER MOUNTAIN TOILET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. A suspected Maoist detonated a small bomb in the toilet </p><p>of the Tiger Mountain travel agency in Kathmandu on November </p><p>10, causing minimal damage. No one was injured in the blast. </p><p>Tiger Mountain CEO Kristjan Edwards said that the suspected </p><p>Maoist posed as a customer and made bookings for 12 Italian </p><p>tourists before placing the bomb in the toilet. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CALL FOR MORE VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Terming the November 11-13 nationwide strike "a success </p><p>with the continuous support of the public," Maoist </p><p>leadership issued a press statement appealing to political </p><p>parties for a round-table conference and lambasting the </p><p>Palace.  The statement further proclaims that "protest </p><p>programs will be continued" until the Maoists\' demands are </p><p>met, and that a "concrete program of agitation will soon be </p><p>declared and publicized." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWKSI </p><p></p></div>
