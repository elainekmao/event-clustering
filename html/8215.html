How would the reliability of budget revenue and </p><p>expenditure estimates best be described? </p><p> </p><p>2 - Moderately reliable. </p><p> </p><p>m.  Please provide evaluation of hose government commitment </p><p>to fiscal transparency and accountability. </p><p> </p><p>As part of the overall reform effort, Vietnam is attempting </p><p>to improve its public expenditure management and the </p><p>consistency and transparency of budgetary information.  Up </p><p>until 1999, the budget was covered by secrecy laws and was </p><p>essentially considered a State secret.  While certain </p><p>"sensitive" budget items will remain opaque, some daylight </p><p>is being inserted into the budget and budget process. </p><p>Previously, only an aggregate amount of the total state </p><p>budget revenue and only a total expenditure figure by </p><p>Ministry was available publicly.  Current publications </p><p>provide details of state revenue broken down into 4 major </p><p>and 11 sub-categories.  Central Ministries and local </p><p>government have begun to disclose more detailed budgetary </p><p>data in accordance with transparency regulations.  For the </p><p>first time, limited budget information is freely available, </p><p>whether posted on the local Commune\'s community bulletin </p><p>board or via the Ministry of Finance\'s web page. However, </p><p>while the situation is improved, Vietnam\'s budgetary system </p><p>is still far from transparent and accountability remains a </p><p>serious problems. </p><p> </p><p>In December 2002, the National Assembly enacted amendments </p><p>to the Law on the State Budget.  Effective for the financial </p><p>year 2004, it provides for the preparation, implementation, </p><p>inspection, supervision, audit and balance of state budget. </p><p>The law clarifies the specific duties and responsibilities </p><p>of each state body in connection with the management and use </p><p>of the revenues and expenditures of the state budget, </p><p>including the National Assembly, the Government, </p><p>governmental bodies, local People\'s Committees and People\'s </p><p>Councils.  Now, Ministry of Finance (MOF) is explicitly in </p><p>charge of budget formulation while the Treasury Department </p><p>(within MOF) is responsible for budget execution and </p><p>reporting. The amendments also provide for the audit of the </p><p>state budget, which must be carried out before the National </p><p>Assembly or the relevant People\'s Council (which approves </p><p>the state budget balance sheet).  The State Auditor is by </p><p>law the only body allowed/required to carry out such audits </p><p>but it is not truly independent from the executive and its </p><p>procedures are not truly transparent. The audit report must </p><p>be reported to the National Assembly, the Government and </p><p>other such bodies specified by law but it is not required to </p><p>make such audits public. </p><p> </p><p>Public Finance reform includes other projects to streamline </p><p>the budget process, revise the budget law to capture `off </p><p>budget\' accounts, better track cash transfers to the </p><p>provinces, and just generally improve data management. </p><p>However, the lack of basic mechanisms for monitoring the </p><p>actual outcomes of public spending, including common </p><p>accounting standards and integrated electronic data </p><p>recording and reporting, weaknesses in transparency and </p><p>accountability continue to exist. </p><p> </p><p>n.  Please list USG programs and activities that promote </p><p>accurate disclosure of revenues and expenditures in the </p><p>national budgets of your host country.  Please also </p><p>summarize the result of those programs and activities. </p><p> </p><p>Increased transparency and accountability in Vietnam is </p><p>directly linked to the country\'s economic, financial and </p><p>trade-related reform efforts.  USAID technical assistance in </p><p>this area focuses on trade and investment, financial sector </p><p>reform and economic governance. The major program in this </p><p>area is the Support for Trade Acceleration (STAR), which is </p><p>designed to support the Government of Vietnam\'s efforts to </p><p>liberalize its trade and investment regime consistent with </p><p>its commitments under the BTA. The BTA covers key issues </p><p>related to transparency, rule of law, market access for </p><p>goods, services and investment, protection of intellectual </p><p>property rights, dispute settlement and business </p><p>facilitation. </p><p> </p><p>Through STAR, the USG provides technical assistance to </p><p>identify necessary changes in laws and regulations, develop </p><p>new laws and regulations that are compatible with </p><p>international trade and investment norms.  In 2002/3, STAR </p><p>assisted Vietnam to revise several keys laws, including the </p><p>overall "Law on the promulgation of Laws" which provides the </p><p>framework for increased lawmaking transparency and </p><p>accountability.  Since 1997, USAID has - through a grant to </p><p>the U.S Vietnam Trade Forum - provided commercial law and </p><p>trade policy assistance to key Vietnamese institutions in </p><p>both the public and private sectors.  The program has </p><p>familiarized key Vietnamese officials with legal and </p><p>economic concepts that are at the root of their reform </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p>USAID works in partnership with the government and the World </p><p>Bank in support of Vietnam\'s emerging financial sector </p><p>reform program.  Over the past two years, USAID has funded </p><p>two IAS audits of a state-owned commercial bank, in support </p><p>of the GOVN/ World Bank/ IMF poverty reduction and growth </p><p>facility (PRGF).  The World Bank is focusing greater </p><p>attention on this area to help Vietnam establish a single </p><p>system for planning, formulating, executing, and reporting </p><p>on the budget through technical assistance and improved </p><p>information technology. In addition, the Asian Development </p><p>Bank and the UNDP are both involved in Public Administration </p><p>Reform activities. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
