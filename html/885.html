<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 005383 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>SANAA FOR STANLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  6/05/02 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PINR, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT: SOMETIMES A PLATFORM IS MORE </p><p>TROUBLE THAN IT\'S WORTH </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERTA NEWELL FOR REASON </p><p>1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  A COMMON REFRAIN AMONG OBSERVERS OF JORDAN\'S </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT (IAF) IS CONDEMNATION OF THE INFURIATINGLY </p><p>VAGUE NATURE OF THE PARTY\'S POLITICAL PLATFORM.  AN OPPONENT OF </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND A VOCAL CRITIC OF MYRIAD GOJ INITIATIVES, </p><p>THE IAF OFFERS JORDAN\'S VOTERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE USUAL PARADE </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT YES-MEN.  THE PARTY\'S VISION FOR JORDAN\'S FUTURE AS </p><p>AN ISLAMIC STATE IS, HOWEVER, BLURRY AT BEST.  THE IAF\'S REFUSAL </p><p>TO DELINEATE ITS OSTENSIBLE RAISON D\'ETRE BEYOND A HIGH-MINDED </p><p>CALL FOR "ISLAM" AS THE BASIS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION CAN BE SEEN AS PART OF A PRAGMATIC STRATEGY FOR </p><p>SELF-PRESERVATION.  AS JORDAN\'S ONLY "ISLAMIC" PARTY, THE IAF </p><p>STEERS A COURSE DESIGNED TO PLEASE ITS MEMBERSHIP, ITS POLITICAL </p><p>CONSTITUENCY, AND THE GOJ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>WHAT DO THEY STAND FOR? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (SAY IT AGAIN) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOJ, IN ITS MORE DEFENSIVE MOMENTS, HAS BEEN KNOWN </p><p>TO CHASTISE THE COUNTRY\'S OPPOSITION, AND THE ISLAMIC ACTION </p><p>FRONT (IAF) IN PARTICULAR, FOR ITS ALMOST PURELY REACTIVE STANCE </p><p>ON POLICY ISSUES.  SIMILAR GRUMBLINGS ABOUT THE IAF\'S NOTORIOUSLY </p><p>DIAPHANOUS PLATFORM CAN BE HEARD AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WHO </p><p>WONDER, FOUR YEARS AFTER THE IAF\'S OFFICIAL REGISTRATION, JUST </p><p>WHAT IT IS THE PARTY HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH.  THE QUESTION HAS EVEN, </p><p>OF LATE, RESONATED WITHIN THE PARTY ITSELF, CULMINATING IN RUMORS </p><p>LAST JANUARY OF A SPLIT BETWEEN SO-CALLED "DOVES" AND "HAWKS" </p><p>OVER WHETHER THE PARTY SHOULD CONSIDER JOINING THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE "DOVES," LED BY PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTIES ABDULLAH AKAILEH AND </p><p>BASSAM EMOUSH, ARGUED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THE IAF TO REFOCUS ITS </p><p>ENERGIES ON ADDRESSING THE COUNTRY\'S DOMESTIC ILLS.  EVEN THOSE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO THE IAF\'S STATED AIMS HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION </p><p>WITH ITS DITHERING.  THEEB ABDULLAH, AN ISLAMIST MP WHO WAS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE IAF\'S PARLIAMENTARY BLOC BETWEEN 1994 AND 1996, </p><p>TRACED HIS SPLIT WITH THE PARTY TO THE IAF\'S FAILURE TO GO BEYOND </p><p>THE SLOGAN "ISLAM IS THE SOLUTION" AND "ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE." </p><p>THE TENDENCY ACROSS THE BOARD HAS BEEN TO TAKE THE IAF\'S FAILURE </p><p>TO AGREE ON A DETAILED PLATFORM AS EVIDENCE OF ITS FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>WEAKNESS AS A POLITICAL PARTY.  IN REALITY, THE PLATFORM\'S VERY </p><p>VAGUENESS HAS BEEN PART OF A PRAGMATIC AND POLITICALLY SAVVY </p><p>DECISION BY THE IAF TO DEFER UNNECESSARY AND POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE </p><p>DEBATES TO THE DISTANT FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>THE PLATFORM (YES, THEY DO HAVE ONE) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT\'S PARTY PLATFORM WAS FORMULATED </p><p>IN 1993, WHEN THE PARTY WAS FIRST REGISTERED, AND HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>UPDATED SINCE.  MORE AKIN TO A CHARTER, THE PLATFORM SETS OUT </p><p>BROAD GUIDELINES FOR THE PARTY\'S ORIENTATION AND LEAVES THE </p><p>SPECIFICS TO SOME AS YET UNREACHED FUTURE DATE.  THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT GOAL FOR THE IAF IS "THE RESUMPTION OF ISLAMIC LIFE AND </p><p>THE APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW IN ALL FIELDS."  SECOND IS </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE PEACE PROCESS; A KEY OBJECTIVE FOR THE PARTY IS </p><p>"THE PREPARATION OF THE NATION FOR ARMED CONFLICT AGAINST THE </p><p>ZIONIST AND IMPERIALIST ENEMIES," AND "NON-RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>USURPER JEWISH ENTITY."  THE PLATFORM CALLS FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT </p><p>OF LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY THROUGH SHURA (CONSULTATION) AND THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  IT ADVOCATES ESTABLISHING </p><p>AN ECONOMY BASED ON ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES, "WHICH ENSURES SOCIAL </p><p>EQUALITY, PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY, PROVIDING EQUAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES, AND COMBATTING CORRUPTION AND UNEMPLOYMENT."  THE </p><p>PLATFORM ALSO SETS OUT "MEANS AND METHODS" FOR ACHIEVING THESE </p><p>OBJECTIVES.  THESE ARE PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DISSEMINATION OF </p><p>INFORMATION, STUDIES, AND PARTICIPATION IN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THE PLATFORM\'S PROMULGATION THE </p><p>PARTY HAS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, REFINED ITS POSITIONS ON A NUMBER </p><p>OF ISSUES, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF COMMUNIQUES TO THE GENERAL </p><p>PUBLIC.  IN THESE STATEMENTS THE IAF HAS BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY </p><p>REACTIVE, RESPONDING TO GOJ DECISIONS OR WORLD EVENTS AS THEY </p><p>ARISE, WITHIN AN ANTI-ISRAELI, ANTI-WESTERN AND ANTI-GOJ </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE THE IAF HAS ISSUED STATEMENTS </p><p>OPPOSING THE RULE OF THE TALEBAN REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN FOR ITS </p><p>"UNISLAMIC" CHARACTER, EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>SUDAN, CONDEMNING U.S. TREATMENT OF MUSA ABU MARZOUK, OPPOSING </p><p>GOJ POLICY ON PUBLIC FREEDOMS, AND CALLING FOR THE ABROGATION OF </p><p>THE JORDAN-ISRAEL PEACE TREATY.  NOTABLY, THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>REMARKABLY FEW COMMUNIQUES DETAILING THE IAF\'S VISION OF AN </p><p>"ISLAMIC" JORDAN, ITS OSTENSIBLE RAISON D\'ETRE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  IN A MAY 15 MEETING WITH POLOFF, THE ISLAMIC ACTION </p><p>FRONT\'S MODERATE SECRETARY GENERAL, ISHAQ FARHAN (PROTECT), </p><p>ELABORATED (SEEMINGLY RELUCTANTLY) ON THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT\'S </p><p>PLANS FOR AN ISLAMIST-GOVERNED JORDAN.  FARHAN SPOKE IN VAGUE </p><p>TERMS ABOUT ISLAM SETTING "GUIDELINES" FOR APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, </p><p>UNTIL PRESSED WITH SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.  POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>IAF\'S INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC LAW.  WOULD </p><p>HANDS BE CUT OFF IN CASES OF THEFT?  FARHAN WOULD NOT RULE IT OUT </p><p>ENTIRELY, COMPARING IT TO THE DEATH PENALTY AS APPROPRIATE FOR </p><p>REPEAT OFFENDERS GUILTY OF "TERRIBLE CRIMES."  HE DISMISSED </p><p>EXECUTION AS A PUNISHMENT FOR APOSTASY, SAYING THAT INDIVIDUALS </p><p>ARE FREE TO CHANGE THEIR RELIGION.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS ONLY </p><p>JUSTIFIED, HE SAID, IN CASES WHERE CONVERTS "ATTACK ISLAM" AND </p><p>TRY TO WOO MUSLIMS AWAY FROM THE FAITH.  FARHAN CONCEDED THAT </p><p>JORDAN IS "FAIRLY ISLAMIC," AND THAT THE IAF AGREES FOR THE MOST </p><p>PART WITH POLICIES AS THEY ARE TODAY.  THE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS ARE </p><p>ALCOHOL AND MONETARY INTEREST.  THE IAF HAS REPEATEDLY PROPOSED </p><p>BANNING ALCOHOL.  MUSLIMS, SAID FARHAN, SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO </p><p>BUY, SELL, OR PRODUCE ALCOHOL.  CHRISTIANS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>BUY AND CONSUME ALCOHOL.  BANKS, HE WENT ON, SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO CHARGE INTEREST ON LOANS.  FARHAN ALSO EXPRESSED THE </p><p>HOPE THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE DISTANT FUTURE THERE WOULD EXIST A </p><p>"UNITED STATES OF ARABIA."  THE MUSING TONE OF FARHAN\'S RESPONSES </p><p>DURING THE MEETING LEFT POLOFF WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL WAS NOT SPEAKING FOR HIS PARTY AS A WHOLE, BUT </p><p>WAS IN FACT EXTRAPOLATING FROM HIS OWN BELIEFS AND VIEWPOINTS (IN </p><p>SOME CASES APPARENTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME) AS TO THE APPROPRIATE </p><p>INTERPRETATION OF ISLAMIC LAW FOR JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>LACK OF SPECIFICITY IS THE KEY TO UNITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE IAF\'S FAILURE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE OVERRIDING </p><p>ISSUE OF HOW TO INTERPRET ISLAMIC LAW STEMS IN LARGE PART FROM </p><p>THE SURPRISINGLY WIDE VARIETY OF BELIEF AND PRACTICE AMONG ITS </p><p>MEMBERS.  (PARTY OFFICIALS NUMBER IAF MEMBERSHIP IN THE </p><p>"THOUSANDS.")   MEMBERS TAKE ALL SHAPES: IBRAHIM GHARAIBEH, A </p><p>THIRTY-SOMETHING MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD MEMBER, IS CLEAN-SHAVEN AND </p><p>SHAKES HANDS WITH WOMEN.  NAWAL FAOURI, A MEMBER OF THE IAF\'S </p><p>SHURA COUNCIL, IS THE HEADMISTRESS OF THREE SCHOOLS, AND </p><p>CONSIDERS POLITICAL ACTIVISM A "RESPONSIBILITY" FOR WOMEN.  ABDUL </p><p>MUNEM ABU ZANT, A PARLIAMENTARIAN KNOWN FOR HIS FIERY RHETORIC, </p><p>ADVOCATES THE WEARING OF HEADSCARVES BY GIRLS AS YOUNG AS EIGHT </p><p>YEARS OLD AND, ACCORDING TO A CANADIAN EMBASSY SECURITY SOURCE </p><p>(PROTECT), HAS BEEN REFUSED ENTRY TO CANADA FOR HIS HAMAS </p><p>FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES THERE.  EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS BELIEVES </p><p>THAT FOR JORDAN, "ISLAM IS THE SOLUTION."  HOWEVER, EACH ONE ALSO </p><p>HAS A UNIQUE CONCEPTION OF WHAT ISLAM REQUIRES OF ITS BELIEVERS </p><p>AND OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY FOR ISLAM TO BE IMPLEMENTED. </p><p>GHARAIBEH, ECHOING THE PARTY LINE, HAS CALLED THIS DIVERGENCE IN </p><p>OPINION "A SOURCE OF STRENGTH" FOR THE PARTY, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS </p><p>FOR OPEN DEBATE AND DISCUSSION OF ISSUES.  THE IAF LEADERSHIP </p><p>APPARENTLY ALSO VIEWS IT AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF WEAKNESS, AS </p><p>FINAL DECISIONS, OR EVEN DISCUSSION, ON DIVISIVE ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR WOMEN COULD CONCEIVABLY UNRAVEL THE </p><p>PARTY\'S DELICATE WEB OF LINKS AMONG ISLAMISTS OF ALL STRIPES.  TO </p><p>AVOID SUCH AN EVENTUALITY THE PARTY HAS STUCK ASSIDUOUSLY TO </p><p>GENERAL TOPICS: OPPOSITION TO PEACE WITH ISRAEL, PAN-ARAB UNITY, </p><p>AND PROMOTION OF PUBLIC FREEDOMS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE VOTERS: A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE PARTY HAS ALSO CLEARLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT </p><p>IN ATTRACTING SUPPORT (AND VOTES) AMONG THE POPULACE, SPECIFICS </p><p>ARE MORE OF A LIABILITY THAN AN ADVANTAGE.  THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ISLAMISTS CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECTED TO PUBLIC RIDICULE FOR THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD\'S HANDLING OF THE EDUCATION, SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND AWQAF PORTFOLIOS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER MUDAR BADRAN IN 1990.  PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION ABDULLAH AKAILEH\'S PROPOSAL TO BAN FATHERS FROM THE </p><p>BASKETBALL GAMES OF THEIR SCHOOLGIRL DAUGHTERS IN ORDER TO </p><p>PROTECT THE MODESTY OF THE OTHER PLAYERS HAS TAUGHT THE IAF THAT </p><p>WHILE JORDANIANS ARE BY AND LARGE SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE, THEIR </p><p>BRAND OF RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE IS TEMPERED WITH A HEALTHY DOSE OF </p><p>COMMON SENSE.  INSTEAD, THE PARTY PREFERS TO TRADE ON ITS </p><p>STRENGTH AS JORDAN\'S ONLY PARTY PURPORTING TO REPRESENT ISLAM. </p><p>FOR NOW THE IAF CONTINUES TO GARNER SUPPORT FROM THE MANY </p><p>JORDANIANS WHO BELIEVE THAT AN "ISLAMIC" PARTY MUST NECESSARILY </p><p>BE BETTER (MORE HONEST, MORE MORAL, MORE IN LINE WITH GOD\'S WILL) </p><p>THAN NON-ISLAMIC PARTIES, AND GIVE LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE DETAILS. </p><p>THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS </p><p>STRATEGY IS BEGINNING TO WANE.  FOUR YEARS AFTER THE PARTY\'S </p><p>FOUNDING, MANY SUCH SUPPORTERS ARE BEGINNING TO QUESTION WHETHER </p><p>THE IAF IS, IN FACT, DIFFERENT FROM THE REST AND WILL EVER BE </p><p>EFFECTIVE IN BRINGING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE.  THESE GRUMBLINGS HAVE </p><p>LED SOME OBSERVERS TO BELIEVE THAT POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE IAF IS </p><p>ACTUALLY DIMINISHING.  FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, HOWEVER, THE IAF </p><p>SEEMS TO HAVE DETERMINED THAT ITS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN POLICY </p><p>TERMS LIES WITH INACTION.  THE PARTY MAY HAVE TO RETHINK ITS </p><p>STRATEGY IF, AS IS POSSIBLE, THE IAF SEES A REDUCTION IN ITS </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>JORDAN\'S NASCENT DEMOCRACY: NOT READY FOR THE DETAILS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE LIMITED NATURE OF JORDAN\'S DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT </p><p>ALSO PUTS A CONSIDERABLE DAMPER ON ANY ATTEMPTS BY IAF MEMBERS TO </p><p>BRING THEIR PARTY\'S AIMS MORE CLEARLY INTO FOCUS.  THE VAGARIES </p><p>OF THE CURRENT ELECTORAL LAW, WHICH IS WEIGHTED IN FAVOR OF PRO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT, TRIBAL CANDIDATES, AND THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE GIVE THE IAF LITTLE INCENTIVE TO GO OUT ON A LIMB </p><p>IN ITS POLICY PRONOUNCEMENTS.  WITH NO CHANCE OF GAINING POWER, </p><p>THERE IS SIMPLY NO NEED.  MOREOVER, BY AGREEING TO ACT AS A PART </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY\'S "LOYAL OPPOSITION" AND OPERATE WITHIN THE </p><p>GUIDELINES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES LAW, THE IAF HAS LIMITED </p><p>LATITUDE TO ADVOCATE TRULY SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CHANGE.  THE </p><p>1992 PARTIES LAW REQUIRES THAT ALL PARTIES ABIDE BY THE </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION (WHICH RESERVES VIRTUALLY ALL </p><p>POWERS FOR THE KING) AND WORK TO PRESERE JORDAN\'S INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>THE LAW RULES OUT ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT ON THE PART OF THE IAF THAT </p><p>IT MIGHT SOMEDAY SEEK TO FUNDAMENTALLY REORGANIZE THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>POLITICAL APPARATUS.  FARHAN\'S UTOPIAN DREAM OF A "UNITED STATES </p><p>OF ARABIA," NO MATTER HOW IT MIGHT RESONATE AMONG ISLAMISTS (AND </p><p>THAT IS DEBATABLE), WILL NEVER FIND ITS WAY ONTO THE IAF\'S </p><p>PLATFORM.  THE PARTY MAY EVEN BE UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE GOJ TO </p><p>AVOID STEPS, SUCH AS ARTICULATING A DETAILED PLATFORM, WHICH </p><p>COULD CAUSE A RUPTURE IN PARTY UNITY.  A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>CONTACT TOLD POLOFF IN JANUARY OF HIS BELIEF THAT THE GOJ, AND </p><p>SPECIFICALLY THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, PREFERS TO </p><p>KEEP THE IAF WHOLE IN ORDER TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE MORE RADICAL </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10.  (U)  THE IAF\'S PRAGMATIC STREAK HAS WIDENED MARKEDLY DURING </p><p>ITS FOUR YEARS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, AND ITS PLATFORM (OR </p><p>LACK THEREOF) IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PARTY HAS LEARNED TO </p><p>"WORK THE SYSTEM" TO ITS ADVANTAGE.  AS LONG AS THE STATUS QUO IN </p><p>TERMS OF DEMOCRATIC PROGRESS REMAINS IN PLACE, THE IAF WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO AVOID SAPPING ITS STRENGTH THROUGH A COSTLY INTERNAL </p><p>DEBATE ON INTERPRETATION OF SHARIA LAW OR THE MECHANICS OF </p><p>"ISLAMIC ECONOMICS."  SHOULD JORDAN CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ALONG </p><p>THE PATH TO DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, THE PARTY WILL BE FORCED TO COME </p><p>TO TERMS WITH THE WIDE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM CURRENTLY REPRESENTED </p><p>WITHIN IT.  IN A WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR THE PARTY, THE MOVEMENT </p><p>WOULD BREAK UP INTO A NUMBER OF SMALLER PARTIES WITH OVERLAPPING </p><p>BUT COMPETING VISIONS FOR AN ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT FOR JORDAN.  THIS </p><p>IS CURRENTLY THE SITUATION FOR JORDAN\'S LEFTIST PARTIES, WHICH </p><p>ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY WEAK DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO OVERCOME </p><p>INTERNECINE SQUABBLES.  WHAT IS MORE LIKELY, GIVEN THE PARTY\'S </p><p>INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC MODUS OPERANDI, IS THAT MEMBERS ON BOTH </p><p>EDGES MAY DRIFT OFF, BUT THE CENTER WILL HOLD AS THE IAF ADOPTS A </p><p>PLATFORM DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO JORDAN\'S CONSERVATIVE, BUT </p><p>SENSIBLE, MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EGAN </p><p></p></div>
