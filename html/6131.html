<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 000806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT AIRPORT PLANS TO MAINTAIN CIVILIAN FLIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY. Kuwait\'s Directorate General of Civil Aviation </p><p>(DGCI) announced that Kuwait International Airport does not </p><p>intend to close operations in face of a potential war in Iraq </p><p>unless military action jeopardizes the safety of civilian </p><p>flights.  Commercial airlines, however, may decide </p><p>individually to stop flights into the country.  So far, most </p><p>airlines continue to fly regular schedules, although some </p><p>carriers have limited the number of routes into and out of </p><p>Kuwait at least through the end of March.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. On March 5, Fawaz Al-Farah, Deputy Director General for </p><p>Aviation Safety and Air Transport at DGCI, told EconOff that </p><p>all efforts will be made to keep Kuwait International Airport </p><p>open.  Al-Farah confirmed and expanded on a report that </p><p>appeared earlier that day in Al-Qabas Arabic-language </p><p>newspaper, which claimed that an agreement had been struck </p><p>between Kuwait\'s Ministry of Defense and DGCI to coordinate </p><p>flight paths for civilian and military aircraft during any </p><p>armed conflict. </p><p> </p><p>3. Al-Farah said that as part of the GOK\'s Emergency </p><p>Contingency Plan -- drafted last month by the Ministry of </p><p>Defense in consultation with the US Military -- the airport </p><p>would only close should it be determined that military action </p><p>placed civilian flights at risk.  At that time a decision </p><p>would be made by DGCI to either partially or fully close </p><p>civilian flight operations until it was deemed safe to reopen </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>4. Al-Farah said that the airport has stepped up security </p><p>measures in the last few weeks.  Airport security officers </p><p>have been given instructions and training on how to respond </p><p>to a variety of emergencies.  Gas masks have been issued to </p><p>key staff members, and all employees have been forbidden from </p><p>taking vacations at this time to ensure adequate personnel is </p><p>available in case of emergency. </p><p> </p><p>5. Most airlines continue to operate at full or slightly </p><p>reduced schedules, Al-Farah said.  KLM and Lufthansa told </p><p>Post separately that they are operating at full capacity, </p><p>while Kuwait Airways has reduced some of its flights to North </p><p>America, Europe, and the Middle East.   British Airways has </p><p>gone from one flight a day to four flights a week at least </p><p>through the end of March.  Al-Farah said BA\'s decision was </p><p>partly due to lower air traffic from London to Kuwait, as </p><p>many British citizens have already left the country, while </p><p>those staying have greatly limited their air travel.  (Note: </p><p>Air China has decided to stop all flights into Kuwait at </p><p>least through the end of March, but this action should not </p><p>have much effect on American travelers. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: Post plans to pass the above information to </p><p>American citizens in Kuwait through its warden system in an </p><p>effort to dispel rumors that Kuwait Airport intends to close. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
