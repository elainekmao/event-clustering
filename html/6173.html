SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary and Introduction - Post recommends that </p><p>Canada not be placed on the Special 301 Watch List.  Recent </p><p>Canadian legislation has addressed several of the concerns </p><p>outlined in previous 301 reports, such as the exclusion of </p><p>Internet retransmission from the compulsory licensing </p><p>regime, and thereby enhanced intellectual property </p><p>protection in Canada.  Several long-standing 301 issues, </p><p>including national treatment of U.S. artists in the </p><p>distribution of proceeds from Canada\'s private copying levy </p><p>and "neighboring rights" regime, have received little </p><p>private sector support (Post has received no queries from </p><p>U.S. interests on either of these issues) and may no longer </p><p>warrant a Watch List recommendation.  Other high-profile </p><p>issues that are of concern to U.S. interests, including the </p><p>delisting of pharmaceutical patents and patenting of higher </p><p>life forms, are currently being reviewed by the GOC and are </p><p>not ripe for inclusion in the Watch List at this time.  Post </p><p>is mindful of the various IP concerns and will continue to </p><p>closely monitor these issues and raise them in meetings with </p><p>GOC officials.  End Summary and Introduction. </p><p> </p><p>-- LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL SUCCESS -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Canada has made real progress in improving its IPR </p><p>regime over the last couple of years. In December 2002, the </p><p>GOC revised its Copyright Act (Bill C-11) to explicitly </p><p>exclude Internet retransmissions from its compulsory </p><p>licensing regime to the satisfaction of U.S. interests (ref </p><p>E).  An Order-In-Council is expected on March 21, 2003, </p><p>which will make C-11 enter into force immediately.  In 2001, </p><p>the government amended its patent law to provide at least a </p><p>20-year term of protection for patents filed before October </p><p>1, 1989. </p><p> </p><p>4. There are legitimate concerns about Canada\'s border </p><p>measures and weak enforcement of IP, both at the borders and </p><p>throughout the country.  Canadian Customs and the Royal </p><p>Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are required by law to take a </p><p>passive approach to border enforcement and have not </p><p>committed the necessary resources to address counterfeiting </p><p>and piracy.  A recent judicial decision, however, is a step </p><p>in the right direction.  In April 2002 the Supreme Court </p><p>decided that Canadian law prohibits the decoding of all </p><p>encrypted satellite signals.  Since this time the GOC, </p><p>working with several cable associations, has stepped up </p><p>efforts to both improve enforcement and address underlying </p><p>legislative issues.  These efforts have not yet crossed over </p><p>to problems related to border enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>-- LIMITED PRIVATE SECTOR INTEREST -- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The GOC has not resolved the outstanding issue of </p><p>national treatment of U.S. artists in the distribution of </p><p>proceeds from Canada\'s private copying levy and its </p><p>"neighboring rights" regime and considers these issues to be </p><p>relatively low priorities (Ref F).  Post has not received </p><p>any support from U.S. industry on these issues in the five </p><p>years that we have recommended Canada be placed on USTR\'s </p><p>Watch List.  Since U.S. industry does not consider these </p><p>issues significant enough for their involvement, we do not </p><p>believe they warrant a Watch List recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>-- ISSUES NOT YET RIPE FOR INCLUSION ON THE WATCH LIST -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Health Canada is currently engaged in an internal </p><p>policy review of several patent issues, including delisting </p><p>specific patents, and Notice of Compliance "linkage" </p><p>regulations.  At the same time, Industry Canada is holding </p><p>public hearings this month on a number of IP issues and will </p><p>focus on linkage regulations.  Until the GOC publishes a </p><p>report that indicates in what direction it will actually </p><p>move, we believe it would be premature at this time to </p><p>recommend placing the GOC on the Watch List because the GOC </p><p>is, in fact, addressing these issues.  In their response to </p><p>PhRMA\'s 301 submission, the GOC noted the complexity of the </p><p>issues and regulations at hand and the fact that "Canada is </p><p>not alone in facing difficult issues regarding patent </p><p>eligibility as it relates to its linkage regime.  Issues </p><p>surrounding patent eligibility and abuse are often the </p><p>subjects of debate in US Congress.  For example, on October </p><p>21, 2002, President Bush announced US intentions to address </p><p>problems relating to perceived delays in the market entry of </p><p>generic drugs." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In December 2002 the Canadian Supreme Court decided </p><p>against allowing the patent on the "Harvard Mouse" on the </p><p>basis that "a higher life form is not patentable because it </p><p>is not a "manufacture" or "composition of matter" within the </p><p>meaning of "invention" in s.2 of the Patent Act." (See ref </p><p>C)  U.S. biotech companies are concerned that the Court\'s </p><p>decision, if left intact, would exclude from patent </p><p>eligibility any invention that is a higher life form.  In </p><p>their decision the Supreme Court Justices made it explicit </p><p>that their word is not the final one on this issue; that it </p><p>is up to Parliament to bring in new legislation to deal with </p><p>the patentability of higher life forms.  As reported in ref </p><p>D, the GOC has stated its intent to modernize Canada\'s </p><p>Patent Act.  While no definite timeline has been announced </p><p>as yet, we do not see a justification to place Canada on the </p><p>Watch List unless the GOC fails to make clear this year its </p><p>determination to amend the Act.
