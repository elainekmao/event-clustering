END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>DART UPDATES FROM UMM QASR </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 4 April, DART members in Umm Qasr met with Coalition </p><p>forces, who provided an overview of the situation in the </p><p>town.  According to Coalition forces, 1,500 to 2,000 people </p><p>from Basrah have moved to Umm Qasr and are living with </p><p>family or friends as a result of fighting in Basrah. </p><p>Coalition forces also said that most Baath party members </p><p>have fled Umm Qasr.  On 3 April, residents burned down a </p><p>house owned by a Baath party supporter.  The same residents </p><p>had planned to burn down several other homes but were </p><p>dissuaded by one of the village elders. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Coalition forces emphasized that the international </p><p>community could demonstrate its goodwill by arranging to </p><p>send in affordable supplies of protein-rich foods, such as </p><p>meat, eggs, and dairy products.  According to Coalition </p><p>forces, despite visits and promises by numerous delegations </p><p>from civilian and military organizations, no substantial </p><p>assistance has yet been delivered to the residents of Umm </p><p>Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In addition to questioning residents at the town market </p><p>about their needs, the DART located a Public Distribution </p><p>System (PDS) agent in the crowd and introduced him to </p><p>representatives from the World Food Program (WFP).  The PDS </p><p>agent said that 30 food agents once operated in the town, </p><p>and that they are all eager to go back to work.  The men in </p><p>the crowd nodded in agreement, and said the food agents were </p><p>`good people\', simply shopkeepers assigned by the Iraqi </p><p>government to distribute food.  The PDS agent interviewed by </p><p>the DART and WFP had distributed food to 200 families, or </p><p>about 600 people, and offered to arrange a meeting with the </p><p>other food agents in town.  The DART offered to facilitate </p><p>the meeting next week, when the WFP team is expected to </p><p>return. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  On 3 April, one Emergency Health Kit was sent from the </p><p>OFDA warehouse to Al Nasiriyah.  This kit was delivered to a </p><p>hospital in Al Nasiriyah by Coalition Forces.  Two more kits </p><p>were sent by Coalition aircraft on 5 April to Basrah.  These </p><p>kits will be forward positioned at Coalition warehouses </p><p>until delivery is authorized by the DART.  Emergency Health </p><p>Kits will be made available to non-governmental </p><p>organizations (NGOs), as needs are identified, with strict </p><p>criteria for their use.  The DART will closely monitor the </p><p>distribution and identify appropriate healthcare providers </p><p>to receive the kits. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to the United Nations Children\'s Fund </p><p>(UNICEF), the immediate concerns in southern Iraq are water </p><p>and education.  UNICEF sent five water tankers into Basrah </p><p>on 4 April and is continuing to supply water to Umm Khayyal, </p><p>Safwan, and Az Zubayr.  UNICEF hopes to reestablish contact </p><p>with its small contract staff in Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The new three-kilometer pipeline that was laid from </p><p>inside the Kuwaiti border to near Umm Qasr is experiencing </p><p>problems related to traffic management and tanker access to </p><p>the pipe stand.  The pipe stand is located within a high </p><p>priority area, and only one tanker at a time is allowed into </p><p>the compound, which creates a bottleneck of water tankers </p><p>waiting and departing on very narrow side streets.  In </p><p>addition, the larger tankers (24,000 to 32,000 liters) </p><p>contracted by UNICEF are having difficulties accessing the </p><p>water pipe stand because of the small space.  According to </p><p>the HOC\'s water engineer, the stand is open daily for twelve </p><p>hours and is producing 6,000 to 8,000 liters per hour, or </p><p>about 100,000 liters per day.  Until second and third water </p><p>stands are added and the traffic congestion problem is </p><p>resolved, the daily output of the pipeline will remain at a </p><p>fraction of its intended output. </p><p> </p><p>8.  One of the water pipelines from Basrah that supplied Umm </p><p>Qasr with wash water appears to be working as water is </p><p>flowing from the pipeline into one of Umm Qasr\'s four water </p><p>holding tanks for the first time since the war began. </p><p>However, without the water treatment plant and pumps </p><p>working, the Basrah pipelines will not be able to provide </p><p>potable water to Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>9.  On 5 April, the DART facilitated a meeting on </p><p>water/sanitation at the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) </p><p>with representatives from relief, reconstruction, and civil </p><p>affairs.  The agenda focused on bridging operational </p><p>coordination until U.N. agencies are fully operational, </p><p>especially UNICEF who has the lead on the health and </p><p>water/sanitation sectors.  Protocols will be developed and </p><p>presented to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance (ORHA), among others. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>USG COORDINATION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 5 April, the DART\'s Deputy Leader briefed ORHA </p><p>leadership on anticipated DART movement into southern Iraq. </p><p>The briefing covered the staffing and area of responsibility </p><p>of the DART\'s Southern Field Office.  ORHA was also briefed </p><p>on the funding mechanisms that have been put in place and </p><p>how commodities will be distributed in order to provide a </p><p>quick response to the humanitarian needs of impacted </p><p>populations throughout Iraq.  The security conditions </p><p>required for DART movement into Iraq, and the fact that DART </p><p>interventions would be assessment-driven and needs-based, </p><p>was stressed to the audience. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The DART\'s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) </p><p>representative briefed each of the three regional </p><p>coordinators from ORHA, and their respective staffs, on the </p><p>DART\'s planned operations and modalities for small grants </p><p>activities in Iraq.  The DART also circulated program </p><p>documents outlining planned procedures for design and </p><p>implementation of grants.  The briefings were well received </p><p>by ORHA coordinators. </p><p> </p><p>12.  DART OTI representatives also met with USAID\'s </p><p>Reconstruction Team in an effort to coordinate with its </p><p>upcoming local government program, which is expected to </p><p>begin mobilization by mid-April.  The DART is working on </p><p>coordinating database development for grants in Iraq.  The </p><p>reaction of the Reconstruction Team to the DART\'s plans has </p><p>been positive, and the need for close coordination of both </p><p>programs has been underscored. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  On 2 April, the DART Abuse Prevention Unit (APU) met </p><p>with ORHA\'s Human Rights Working Group (HRWG).  The HRWG </p><p>discussed the creation of a Human Rights Ombudsperson for </p><p>Iraq that would be a central repository of past human rights </p><p>abuses.  This information could be used for a future truth </p><p>and reconciliation commission or whatever judicial </p><p>procedures are established after the transition period.  The </p><p>APU also discussed the implications that the dissolution of </p><p>the Umm Qasr governing and judicial system, in addition to </p><p>the food distribution system, has for protection and other </p><p>transitional issues. </p><p> </p><p>14.  On 4 April, the APU met with a senior U.S. Central </p><p>Command (CENTCOM) civil-military operations planner.  The </p><p>APU inquired about Coalition plans for a police force in the </p><p>event that the local police flee and the justice system </p><p>dissolves.  According to CENTCOM, there is no theater-wide </p><p>plan for giving all regions military police, as conditions </p><p>in each village will be different. </p><p> </p><p>15.  On 5 April, the APU met with human rights and </p><p>humanitarian organizations including Physicians for Human </p><p>Rights, Refugees International, the American Refugee </p><p>Committee, and the Iraqi Refugee Aid Council (IRAC).  ORHA\'s </p><p>Human Rights Officer also participated.  The group discussed </p><p>unconfirmed reports of executions in southern Iraq received </p><p>from civilians using satellite phones. </p><p>Though these reports are unconfirmed, they have been </p><p>received through non-governmental organization (NGO) </p><p>networks and are believed to be fairly reliable sources. </p><p>The APU will attempt to confirm them. </p><p> </p><p>16.  IRAC also reported on its previous efforts to secure a </p><p>comprehensive computer database from the Iraqi General </p><p>Security Organization that contains elaborate records of all </p><p>civilians arrested, where they were imprisoned, and whether </p><p>or not they have been killed.  IRAC provided the location of </p><p>this database, and the APU is making it a top priority to </p><p>pass this information to Coalition Forces.  The APU also has </p><p>information on the location of the property registry office </p><p>that holds all public and private property documents in </p><p>Baghdad.  Securing these documents is also a priority, and </p><p>the APU will work with Coalition Forces to that end.  IRAC </p><p>pointed out that meticulous paper records have also been </p><p>kept at the local level. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
