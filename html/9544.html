<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-21-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, ETRD, SOCI, MV, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Excitement over Maldivian economic growth </p><p>tempered by development worries </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) Colombo 1244; (B) 02 Colombo 2329 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During recent Embassy meetings in the </p><p>Maldives, government and business interlocutors spoke </p><p>about the positive social and economic developments in </p><p>the country in recent years, spurred especially by the </p><p>growth of the tourism industry.  These contacts worried, </p><p>however, about the government\'s ability to continue this </p><p>development trend and generate opportunities for the </p><p>growing youth population.  The government will face some </p><p>serious logistic and social challenges to provide for </p><p>all Maldivians, a task which contacts feared would </p><p>become extremely difficult if LDC status were lost.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) VISIT TO MALE:  Charge Camp and emboffs visited </p><p>the Maldives, July 13-15.  The U.S. team met ministry </p><p>officials, as well as business and non-governmental </p><p>organization contacts.  The meetings took place in the </p><p>Maldivian capital of Male, an island that is home to </p><p>one-quarter of the country\'s population of approximately </p><p>300,000 people.  During the visit, Male was bustling and </p><p>its streets were full of life.  There was also much </p><p>evidence of construction, especially of apartment </p><p>buildings to house the city\'s expanding population. </p><p>(Note:  Though the government tries to discourage it, </p><p>there is considerable migration from other islands to </p><p>Male, which is part of the most prosperous atoll in the </p><p>country.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PROS OF DEVELOPMENT:  Our contacts in the </p><p>government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and </p><p>business sectors all spoke of the positive economic </p><p>developments within the country in recent years.  The </p><p>Ministry of Planning cited a tripling in GDP per capita </p><p>income over the last decade while several sources </p><p>reported that electricity, phone service, primary </p><p>education and health clinics are now present on all 200 </p><p>inhabited islands.  The tourism industry continues to </p><p>expand -- numbers suggest annual visitors will soon be </p><p>double that of the population -- and recent new </p><p>investment has led many interlocutors to feel that these </p><p>development trends are likely to continue in the near </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NEW "ISLAND" IN ATOLL:  Some of this economic </p><p>prosperity can be seen in the opportunities available in </p><p>Male, and its attraction to residents from other </p><p>islands.  As a result, the increasing population on Male </p><p>has created a serious problem of overcrowding.  (Note: </p><p>Male, on a .77 sq. mile island, is home to 74,000 people, </p><p>resulting in a population density 50 percent greater </p><p>than that of Manhattan.)  In response to this issue, </p><p>government contacts were eager to share plans about a </p><p>neighboring "island" that is being reclaimed from a </p><p>lagoon in the sea.  Called Hulhumale, the development </p><p>project is scheduled to continue for the next 15-30 </p><p>years on this former lagoon located two islands </p><p>northeast of Male.  Government plans call for the first </p><p>250 houses, with municipal infrastructure and some local </p><p>business, to be completed by the end of 2003.  When </p><p>finished, the island will have triple the area of Male </p><p>and many of its residents are expected to commute by </p><p>ferry to Male.  One foreign ministry official said he </p><p>was already looking forward to moving there, to have </p><p>more space than he currently had on Male. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WORRIES ABOUT CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT:  At the same </p><p>time, many sources expressed reservations about the long- </p><p>term ability of the government to sustain such </p><p>development trends.  The unique problem of having a </p><p>population spread over 540 miles from north to south on </p><p>200 inhabited islands makes many development efforts </p><p>economically challenging and commercially infeasible. </p><p>Ministry officials said that telecom service on an </p><p>island, for example, may be limited to a single public </p><p>pay telephone and the cost of building an island school </p><p>was six times that of a comparable Sri Lanka one.  NGO </p><p>and government contacts stated that some economic figures </p><p>were misleading, as they included expatriate wages and </p><p>foreign corporate profits which do not get recycled in </p><p>the Maldivian economy.  Rather, some NGO officials said </p><p>20 percent of the population is estimated to live on less </p><p>than one USD a day.  (Note:  Official statistics cite an </p><p>average 2100 USD per capita annual income.)  Ministry </p><p>officials were also concerned that continued investment </p><p>funding by major development banks and favorable trading </p><p>status crucial to this pace in growth would be in </p><p>jeopardy if the country lost its LDC status. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IN THE WAKE OF GROWTH: </p><p>Perhaps the most significant problem mentioned by all </p><p>interlocutors was a lack of opportunities for young </p><p>Maldivians.  More students are now able to go abroad for </p><p>higher education opportunities, but return to find very </p><p>little productive work.  Even those who complete only </p><p>secondary education find their liberal arts-focused </p><p>curricula lacking in necessary trade skills.  With 55 </p><p>percent of the population under 20, contacts admitted the </p><p>employment problem would only increase.  Foreign Ministry </p><p>officials feared that a growing population of idle youths </p><p>could eventually provide fertile ground for Islamic </p><p>fundamentalist movements to gain a foothold in the </p><p>moderate Islamic country. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  A number of factors stand in the way of </p><p>the development of the Maldives.  Among these are vast </p><p>inequalities in wealth between residents of Male and </p><p>those of the outer atolls, and the enormous costs of </p><p>providing even basic services to the distant communities </p><p>which make up the majority of the country\'s population. </p><p>The achievements of the last decade look impressive on </p><p>paper and have indeed benefited the Maldivian people. </p><p>Realistically, however, the development of the Maldives </p><p>continues to hinge on the international aid and </p><p>favorable trading agreements it receives as a result of </p><p>its LDC status.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
