<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 000485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, SA/PD; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 03-24-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, KPAO, CE, NO, JA, CH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sixth round of talks proves constructive; </p><p>Tigers reportedly sink Chinese fishing boat </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 03/21/03 e-mail </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 475, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The sixth round of GSL-LTTE talks </p><p>wrapped up on March 21, with the two sides issuing a </p><p>comprehensive press statement.  Minister Moragoda, a key </p><p>GSL negotiator, told the Ambassador he was encouraged by </p><p>the talks -- the Tigers seemed committed to the peace </p><p>track for now and badly wanted U.S. recognition.  As the </p><p>talks wrapped up, reports came in that the Tigers had </p><p>apparently sunk a Chinese fishing boat on March 20.  The </p><p>fact that the talks went as well as they did provided a </p><p>solid boost for the peace process.  Suggested press </p><p>guidance is contained in Para 8.  Mission plans to issue </p><p>this guidance on March 25 unless otherwise directed. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>Moragoda\'s Comments </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The sixth round of Norwegian-facilitated talks </p><p>between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) wrapped up on a largely </p><p>positive note on March 21.  (Note:  The talks took place </p><p>in Hakone, Japan, from March 18-21.)  In a March 22 </p><p>conversation with the Ambassador, Milinda Moragoda </p><p>(Amcit -- pls protect), the Minister of Economic Reform </p><p>and a key GSL negotiator, said he was encouraged by the </p><p>talks and stated that, in his estimation, three </p><p>headlines emerged from them.  First, the Tigers had </p><p>clearly shown in Hakone that they did not want the talks </p><p>to fall apart, at least not now.  Second, the Tigers </p><p>want to be perceived not as terrorists, but as "freedom </p><p>fighters" -- international recognition, especially by </p><p>the United States, is key for them.  Third, the Tigers </p><p>want and need money for development of  "their" part of </p><p>Sri Lanka (i.e., the sections of the north and east </p><p>under their control). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Moragoda went on to make the following specific </p><p>remarks re the talks: </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE senior negotiator Anton Balasingham is "very, </p><p>very" worried about the Tiger navy (the "Sea Tigers"). </p><p>The Sea Tigers "feel caged," are bristling with </p><p>resentment, and ready to go back to war if they could. </p><p>(Note:  See Paras 5-6 regarding reports that the Sea </p><p>Tigers were involved in the March 20 sinking of a </p><p>Chinese fishing boat.) </p><p> </p><p>-- During the talks, LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran called </p><p>Balasingham at least twice a day. </p><p> </p><p>-- The LTTE said it wanted an expansion of the Sub- </p><p>Committee on Immediate Humanitarian Rehabilitation Needs </p><p>(SIHRN) so that the body can consider mid- and long- </p><p>range projects for the north/east.  Moragoda said the </p><p>GSL would only agree to this if the LTTE agreed to talk </p><p>about political structures and milestones to be reached </p><p>prior to a final settlement. </p><p> </p><p>-- Moragoda said he was very worried about chain-of- </p><p>command issues within the Sri Lankan military.  He </p><p>expressed concerns, "for example," about a March 10 </p><p>incident in which the navy attacked and sunk a LTTE ship </p><p>off the northeast coast without what he considered a </p><p>clear political go-ahead from GSL leaders.  (Note:  Due </p><p>to this incident, which resulted in the deaths of 11 </p><p>LTTE cadre, the Tigers almost boycotted the Hakone </p><p>talks.  The navy asserts that the LTTE ship was carrying </p><p>arms.)  Overall, he felt that civilian control over the </p><p>military was "too loose" and that Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe was not exerting enough control. </p><p> </p><p>-- Moragoda said he felt that the Japanese hosts of the </p><p>Hakone talks were "out of their depth" on political </p><p>issues.  He added that he noticed tension between the </p><p>Japanese and the Norwegian facilitators throughout the </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>-- At the end of the conversation about the talks, </p><p>Moragoda reflected and said that it had been important </p><p>that the two sides had reached an understanding in </p><p>Hakone that the ceasefire needed to be consolidated. </p><p>The security situation needed to be managed very </p><p>carefully, and he was pleased in this regard that there </p><p>would be a meeting between the Sri Lankan navy and Sea </p><p>Tiger commanders in the next several weeks (see Para 4). </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Joint Press Statement </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) At the close of the talks on March 21, the two </p><p>sides issued a joint press statement through the offices </p><p>of the Norwegian facilitators.  (Note:  The text of this </p><p>statement was passed to SA/INS in Ref A.)  Per the </p><p>statement, key topics addressed at the talks included </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ceasefire Modalities:  As noted by Moragoda, the two </p><p>sides discussed ways to avoid a repetition of recent sea </p><p>confrontations, such as the March 10 incident.  The two </p><p>sides agreed to meet within three weeks in order to </p><p>review the February 2002 ceasefire agreement and find </p><p>ways to improve on it in regard to sea-related issues. </p><p>The two sides also agreed to establish clear modalities </p><p>for handling GSL soldiers and LTTE cadre captured by the </p><p>other party.  (Note:  There have a number of incidents </p><p>in which the LTTE has detained GSL troops and police, </p><p>and refused to release them for days and weeks at a </p><p>time.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Strengthening the Monitors:  As part of the general </p><p>effort to improve the implementation of the ceasefire </p><p>agreement, the two sides agreed "to strengthen the </p><p>mandate and capacity" of the Norwegian-run SLMM.  The </p><p>two sides also agreed to "guarantee the security" of </p><p>SLMM personnel.  (Note:  The security of SLMM personnel </p><p>became a major issue after monitors were forced to jump </p><p>for their lives from a burning LTTE boat in February.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Federalism:  Reconfirming their commitment to </p><p>"develop a federal system based on internal self- </p><p>determination within a united Sri Lanka," the two sides </p><p>discussed "essential elements" of federalism, including </p><p>fiscal issues.  (Note:  Per Ref B, in a March 20 meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>stated that the GSL had proposed an outline regarding </p><p>long-term political issues to the Tigers.  The PM was </p><p>not clear on the exact nature of the GSL\'s proposal.  He </p><p>said the LTTE did not respond immediately, but promised </p><p>to review the proposal.  In an interesting aside, </p><p>Moragoda told the Ambassador that Balasingham had told </p><p>him the following:  "You know, Milinda, we can\'t have a </p><p>final settlement until Ranil is president."  In making </p><p>this comment, Balasingham was clearly hitting out at </p><p>President Kumaratunga and others who have taken a </p><p>critical stance toward the peace process.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- North/East Local Elections:  The LTTE indicated that </p><p>it would "favorably consider" allowing the government to </p><p>call new local elections in the north and east.  (Note: </p><p>Local elections in these two regions have been postponed </p><p>for some time.  In his conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>Moragoda said Balasingham had confirmed the LTTE\'s </p><p>intention to consider seriously allowing these elections </p><p>to go forward.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Human Rights:  The press statement also reviewed a </p><p>human rights "road map" put forward by Ian Martin, a </p><p>former Amnesty International official.  The road map, </p><p>among other matters, proposes that the two sides agree </p><p>to a "declaration" on human rights, and allow human </p><p>rights training for LTTE cadre and government personnel. </p><p>Per Ref B, the LTTE apparently did not sign on to the </p><p>road map at the talks, stating that it needed further </p><p>time to review it.  (Note:  Moragoda said Martin\'s </p><p>presentation at the talks provoked yawns from both </p><p>delegations.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Meeting Schedule:  The two sides agreed to the </p><p>following schedule of meetings: </p><p> </p><p>- April 29 to May 2 in Thailand </p><p>- June 12-15 in Japan </p><p>- July 15-18 in Europe (venue to be determined) </p><p>(Note:  The April/May and June dates are not new, but </p><p>the July date is.) </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Chinese Fishing Boat Attacked </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) As the talks wrapped up on March 21, reports </p><p>came in that the Tigers had apparently sunk a Chinese </p><p>fishing boat off the northeast coast in the early </p><p>morning hours of March 20.  Details are still sketchy, </p><p>but it seems that small boats with armed personnel </p><p>attacked the Chinese boat about 20 or so miles off the </p><p>LTTE-controlled coastal town of Mullaitivu.  According </p><p>to reports, up to 17 crew on the Chinese boat are </p><p>missing and feared dead (three bodies have been found, </p><p>so far).  (Note:  Most of those missing are Chinese </p><p>nationals, but some may be Sri Lankan.)  The Sri Lankan </p><p>navy, which is conducting a search and rescue operation, </p><p>claims that the Sea Tigers carried out the attack.  For </p><p>their part, the Tigers have vigorously denied </p><p>involvement.  The SLMM is still investigating the </p><p>incident.  The Chinese Embassy in Colombo has lodged a </p><p>complaint with the Sri Lankan MFA and demanded a full- </p><p>and-complete investigation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) When asked about the mysterious incident, most </p><p>observers told us that they believed, per the available </p><p>evidence, that the LTTE almost certainly sank the boat. </p><p>They were not clear exactly why the Tigers may have done </p><p>so, however.  Some speculated that the LTTE may have </p><p>felt that the Chinese fishing boat had gotten too close </p><p>to sensitive LTTE military outposts near Mullaitivu and </p><p>decided to sink the boat without checking its identity. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The fact that the talks went as well as they did </p><p>provided a solid boost for the peace process.  There had </p><p>been real fears after the March 10 incident that the </p><p>Tigers might boycott the talks or choose to use them as </p><p>a platform to criticize the government.  Except for the </p><p>first day of talks when the Tigers discussed the </p><p>incident in a non-rancorous way, the LTTE did not dwell </p><p>on the incident and seemed to go out of its way to make </p><p>clear that it wanted to move forward with the peace </p><p>process.  Moragoda, for one, came away with increased </p><p>confidence that the Tigers want to make the process </p><p>work, at least for now.  By taking a softer tack, the </p><p>Tigers certainly made things much easier for the </p><p>government.  The GSL had been taking a lot of flak from </p><p>the Opposition re the peace process and will, no doubt, </p><p>continue to do so.  Nonetheless, the fact that the </p><p>Tigers were cooperative in Hakone will make it harder </p><p>for the Opposition to score political points.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Suggested press guidance follows below.  Mission </p><p>plans to issue guidance along these lines on March 25 </p><p>unless otherwise directed. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. has taken note of the talks between the </p><p>Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) held in Hakone, Japan, from March 18-21. </p><p>We are encouraged by the substantive and comprehensive </p><p>nature of the talks, which focused on such issues as </p><p>federalism and human rights.  Most importantly, we </p><p>welcome the discussions on ways to improve ceasefire </p><p>modalities.  We hope these discussions will lead to a </p><p>cessation of efforts by the LTTE to smuggle arms into </p><p>Sri Lanka and prevent confrontations such as the one </p><p>which took place off the northeast coast on March 10. </p><p>It is positive that the two sides have agreed to meet </p><p>again in April/May, in June, and in July.  We salute the </p><p>Norwegian government for facilitating the talks and the </p><p>Japanese government for hosting them. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the March 20 incident in which the LTTE </p><p>reportedly attacked and sank a Chinese fishing boat, we </p><p>note that information is still very sketchy.  We support </p><p>a complete and immediate investigation into what took </p><p>place.  We, of course, deplore the loss of life and hope </p><p>those missing will be found soon. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
