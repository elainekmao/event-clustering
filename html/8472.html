<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 002448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OTRA, PREL, IZ, JO, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: REVISED PROCEDURES FOR COALITION PARTNERS </p><p>DEPARTING IRAQ VIA KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action message.  See paragraph 4 below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DCM, CONS Chief and OMC-K JAG met June 3 with Kuwaiti </p><p>Chief of Immigration COL Abdullah Yousef Al-Ruwaieh and LTCOL </p><p>Adeeb Al-Sweidan to discuss procedures which will allow CPA </p><p>personnel currently in Iraq in an official capacity to depart </p><p>via Kuwait.  DCM explained to the Kuwaitis that large numbers </p><p>of CPA personnel had transited Kuwait on their way to </p><p>assignments in Iraq just prior to and during the war. </p><p>Significant numbers of those personnel were now ready to </p><p>depart but Baghdad International Airport remained closed, </p><p>which requires them in many cases to fly out through Kuwait. </p><p>The exigencies of the situation in Iraq and the details of </p><p>their departures from Kuwait, however, had in many cases </p><p>prevented these travelers from complying with Kuwaiti </p><p>immigration law.  This was particularly acute in the case of </p><p>civilians who entered Kuwait via milair and who now needed to </p><p>leave via Kuwait on commercial air.  In many cases, these </p><p>people did not have Kuwaiti stamps in their passports or the </p><p>Kuwaiti stamps which were in their passports indicated that </p><p>they had overstayed their legal limits in violation of </p><p>Kuwaiti immigration laws.  Fines were being levied and the </p><p>U.S. sought jointly to establish with the Kuwaitis a solution </p><p>to this problem.  COL Al-Ruwaieh said the Kuwaitis wanted to </p><p>be helpful.  After considerable discussion, the following </p><p>procedures were agreed: </p><p> </p><p>a) Kuwait agrees that it will accept a letter from the Office </p><p>of the Coalition Provisional Authority, duly stamped, which </p><p>requests exemption from fines and fees for the bearer. </p><p>Embassy is consulting with Kuwaitis now on acceptable </p><p>language and will provide this language to OCPA in Baghdad as </p><p>soon as it is confirmed.  Embassy will also provide Arabic </p><p>translation of the letter, and stands ready to have the </p><p>letters printed in Kuwait if OCPA would find that useful. </p><p> </p><p>b) Travelers who present these letters to Kuwaiti immigration </p><p>authorities on the commercial side of the airport will be </p><p>allowed to depart.  Travelers should understand, however, </p><p>that this process could take up to 24 hours, and they should </p><p>be prepared to spend at least one night in a hotel. </p><p> </p><p>c) For those travelers who are able to plan in advance, </p><p>Kuwait Immigration requests that OCPA provide 24-hour notice </p><p>via fax from Baghdad directly to Kuwait Immigration.  Embassy </p><p>will provide this fax number to OCPA as soon as the entire </p><p>procedure is agreed with the Kuwaiti immigration authorities. </p><p> For those people with this 24-hour notification, there </p><p>should be minimal delay at the airport. </p><p> </p><p>d) This CPA letter of transportation will be valid at either </p><p>the Kuwaiti land border post at Abdalli and only at Abdalli, </p><p>or at the airport if the traveler has flown milair into </p><p>Kuwait from Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>e) Those official travelers who do not present such letters </p><p>will be turned around and returned to Iraq to secure the </p><p>letter. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Embassy is proceeding along the lines above to ensure </p><p>that future CPA travelers are able to meet Kuwaiti </p><p>requirements.  We have cleared this telegram with OCPA, which </p><p>believes it to be a reasonable resolution of this thorny </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACTION REQUEST:  Kuwaitis have bent over backwards in </p><p>completely waiving the normal requirements for transit </p><p>through this country.  We believe that this procedure should </p><p>remedy the difficulties which travelers have been </p><p>experiencing heretofore.  We emphasize, however, that it is </p><p>incumbent upon all travelers, journalists, DOD contractors </p><p>and OCPA civilians to avail themselves of the letter from </p><p>OCPA.  Without it, Embassy will not be able to intervene to </p><p>waive fees or otherwise to procure visas at the airport. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
