(C) Summary:  Japanese experts say that Japan plans to </p><p>discuss economic reform during Prime Minister Koizumi\'s </p><p>meeting with Senior General Than Shwe at the November ASEAN </p><p>3 meeting in Phnom Penh.  They have also promised to share </p><p>with us a copy of their proposed program for Burmese </p><p>structural adjustment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Aid Plan? Not Yet. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Professor Masahiko Ebashi, one of the leaders of a </p><p>Japanese government-sponsored team here to work with the </p><p>Burmese government on structural reform, told the Chief of </p><p>Mission that the Japanese government is eager to get economic </p><p>reform started in Burma, and is willing to pay for it.  The </p><p>team of Japanese experts will complete its work here soon, </p><p>expecting to finalize a report by December for publication </p><p>next March. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Professor Ebashi was discouraged by the complete </p><p>disinterest of the Ministers with whom his team was supposed </p><p>to be working.  Only Brigadier General David Abel, the </p><p>regime\'s sole competent economic mind, has worked closely </p><p>with the group.  However, Ebashi was encouraged that </p><p>technocrats in the Central Bank and other agencies had shown </p><p>a "genuine" interest in reform.  He said his group had </p><p>concluded that it was essential to build capacity now within </p><p>the GOB through engagement and promotion of economic reform. </p><p>It will be too late if the international community waits </p><p>until the political situation changes.  Further sanctions </p><p>and/or continued economic isolation, he fears, will destroy </p><p>whatever influence these nascent reformers have. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The leadership of Burma has made it clear, however, </p><p>that they will not implement any reforms unless there is </p><p>accompanying finance.  Ebashi said that he believed the IMF </p><p>had made a mistake by issuing reform instructions with no aid </p><p>to back it up (see Ref D).  To avoid similar problems, his </p><p>team was designing a program of incremental economic </p><p>structural adjustment aid, each tranche of which would be </p><p>tied to specific economic reforms.  This model had worked </p><p>before in Vietnam, he said.  However, Burma could not be </p><p>subjected to the same strict conditionality as Vietnam, </p><p>Ebashi argued.  Ebashi said that he hopes a reform package </p><p>for Burma could be developed in time for the bilateral </p><p>meeting scheduled between Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi and </p><p>Burma\'s Senior General Than Shwe at the November ASEAN   3 </p><p>Summit in Phnom Penh. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ebashi may be the only one thinking along these lines, </p><p>however.  Japanese Embassy officials here tell us that while </p><p>a bilateral meeting at the ASEAN   3 is in the works, nothing </p><p>is finalized yet.  If this meeting is arranged, one official </p><p>said, economic reform will certainly be a topic for </p><p>discussion, but there will not be talk of structural </p><p>assistance.  The Japanese government, he said, recognizes </p><p>that any talk of financial assistance for structural reform </p><p>would be premature, pending further motion on political </p><p>transition in Burma.  He also said that the GOJ would share </p><p>with us a copy of its report on structural adjustment here </p><p>when it is ready, and would consult with the United States, </p><p>the IMF, and the World Bank before taking any significant </p><p>steps in Burma.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
