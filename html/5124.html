<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000115 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, IR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: BAGHDAD ON HIS MIND: GOK\'S PRE-OCCUPATION WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Richard H. Jones for Reason 1.5 D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a recent meeting with a visiting </p><p>delegation led by former US senior diplomat Frank Wisner, </p><p>Kuwait\'s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Al-Sabah shared candid views on pressing priorities </p><p>for his government.  Discussion centered on four main themes: </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s removal; visions for a new Iraq; America\'s </p><p>interest and image in the region; and the role Arab states </p><p>should assume at this time.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On January 11, 2003, Dr. Mohammed met with Ambassador </p><p>Wisner\'s four-member non-governmental delegation, which was </p><p>in Kuwait to lead a seminar on economic reform organized by </p><p>the Embassy and hosted by the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and </p><p>Industry (septel).  Ambassador Wisner, a former Under </p><p>Secretary of Defense for Policy and of State for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>International Security Affairs, was joined by Henry Siegman, </p><p>Director and Senior Fellow of the US/Middle East Project at </p><p>the Council on Foreign Relations (which commissioned the </p><p>study from which the seminar was based); Dr. Bernard Hoekman, </p><p>Research Manager of the International Trade Group at the </p><p>World Bank (who co-wrote the study); and Fouad Makzoumi, a </p><p>Lebanese businessman and Chairman of the Future Pipe Group </p><p>(who sponsored the study).  Also attending the meeting with </p><p>Dr. Mohammed were Ambassador Jones and Econoff (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SADDAM MUST GO:  Asked how the United States should </p><p>understand Kuwaiti needs, Dr. Mohammed was blunt and explicit </p><p>in his response.  In the short term, he said, Saddam must </p><p>exit the scene.  In his view, the Iraqi leader was a pariah </p><p>who had committed sacrileges that placed him beyond </p><p>redemption or rehabilitation.  Dr. Mohammed said consensus </p><p>among Gulf leaders was that Saddam is a compulsive liar who </p><p>cannot be trusted and a dangerous man who has brought great </p><p>instability to the region. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Dr. Mohammed was doubtful regarding the possibility of </p><p>resolving the present standoff without military conflict.  He </p><p>acknowledged that providing Saddam exile had become a hot </p><p>topic of discussion throughout the Arab world, with much </p><p>press speculation that both Arab and non-Arab envoys were </p><p>visiting Baghdad to offer him safe passage.  Dr. Mohammed </p><p>predicted that these invitations would increase in the coming </p><p>weeks but that the Iraqi leader would  ultimately spurn them </p><p>all.  "Saddam invented the concept of the human shield," the </p><p>Kuwaiti  minister said, "so I would be surprised to see him </p><p>exit before many Iraqis are sacrificed." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Dr. Mohammed did not expect many negative reactions </p><p>toward the United States should it use military force against </p><p>Iraq.  On the contrary, he said, expectations in the region </p><p>were that the "nightmare" would soon be over.  The mood in </p><p>Kuwait was upbeat, he added, noting that the stock market was </p><p>"going through the roof" in anticipation that Iraq soon would </p><p>be opening again for business. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BUILDING A NEW IRAQ:  Ambassador Wisner told Dr. </p><p>Mohammed that in his view there would be violent </p><p>confrontation in Iraq, followed by a period of chaos and </p><p>uncertainty.  Even if Saddam were to leave peacefully, he </p><p>said, the United States would still require certain criteria </p><p>be met in the formation of a new Iraq.  These conditions </p><p>included that Iraq become peaceful and friendly with its </p><p>neighbors and that weapons of mass destruction be accounted </p><p>for and destroyed.  Dr. Mohammed agreed that Saddam\'s removal </p><p>was necessary but not sufficient.  He said that in the long </p><p>term there needed to be a more stable, democratic Iraq, and </p><p>the question now was how to achieve this outcome. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Kuwaiti minister observed that Iraq was in essence </p><p>a failed state, which had become partitioned and was not </p><p>likely to be reconstructed in its present configuration.  He </p><p>added that another "strongman" leader, such as Saddam, was </p><p>not apt to succeed, and what the country needed now was a </p><p>completely different direction.  Ambassador Wisner agreed, </p><p>stating that a new Iraq should be reconstructed as a </p><p>confederation, with a center shared between the major ethnic </p><p>and religious groups.  He outlined three stages for </p><p>development: 1) "early," in which order is re-established; 2) </p><p>"transitional," in which key Iraqis are consulted and </p><p>advised; and 3) "permanent," in which Iraq begins attending </p><p>again to its own affairs. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Dr. Mohammed asked what role in this reconstruction </p><p>process the USG sees for the Iraqi opposition groups. </p><p>Ambassador Wisner replied emphatically that there is no </p><p>government in exile waiting to rule Iraq and that no external </p><p>entity, such as the Iraqi National Congress, would </p><p>exclusively run the country.  He said that post-Saddam Iraq </p><p>will require a combination of outside actors and individuals </p><p>presently inside the country, including figures from the </p><p>military once it has been cleansed of its subversive Baathist </p><p>elements.  Ambassador Jones added that the USG has resisted </p><p>the opportunity to name a government-in-exile, as the INC had </p><p>hoped, believing it would become the de-facto government in a </p><p>new Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) EYE ON AMERICA: Dr. Mohammed said one critical concern </p><p>within the Arab world, including the Gulf states, is that </p><p>America will overreach in its strategy toward Iraq.  He said </p><p>many people in the region are drawing parallels between the </p><p>United States now and the old European imperialist powers. </p><p>They fear that America sees its role as carrying a "White </p><p>Man\'s Burden," marching into the region "to civilize the </p><p>savages and teach the lesser breeds the virtues of </p><p>self-rule."  Many see in the USG\'s policy toward Iraq an </p><p>intention of molding the region in America\'s own image.  More </p><p>conservative elements are characterizing this development as </p><p>a clash with Islam, and the Western press is only serving to </p><p>fuel the debate. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ambassador Wisner assured Dr. Mohammed that the USG </p><p>is not on an imperialistic crusade but rather on a mission to </p><p>bring lasting peace and stability to Iraq and the region.  He </p><p>added that there is wide debate in the United States over the </p><p>shape of a new Iraq, which is being driven by the </p><p>practicalities of bringing about this change.  When Dr. </p><p>Mohammed suggested that the next step in this process must </p><p>include a review of US-Iran relations, Ambassador Wisner </p><p>agreed that this was both advisable and necessary.  He added </p><p>that the US is working on finding the best way to talk to the </p><p>Iranians, which is never an easy task.  (NOTE: Dr. Mohammed </p><p>was proud to convey that Kuwait\'s Foreign Minister Shaykh </p><p>Sabah Al-Ahmad was that day visiting Iran, after Iraq\'s </p><p>Foreign Minister had been refused in Tehran.  Local press </p><p>reported January 14 that Kuwait and Iran issued a joint </p><p>communique on their intention to strengthen ties in several </p><p>areas, including security, defense, and economic cooperation </p><p>(septel).  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ARAB OPPORTUNITIES: Ambassador Wisner stressed that </p><p>now more than ever it is vital for Washington and the West to </p><p>hear from Kuwait and other Arab states about their vision for </p><p>a new Iraq.  He said now is the moment of opportunity for </p><p>Arab leaders to be heard, and it is important for President </p><p>Bush to receive candid views from friends of the United </p><p>States, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf </p><p>states.  Dr. Mohammed took a long time to reflect after </p><p>Ambassador Wisner commented that "he who is on the side of </p><p>the US now is a friend; he who is against the US will be long </p><p>remembered; and he who is on the side of the US with clear </p><p>advice to offer will be respected." </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) In response to Dr. Mohammed\'s comment that there can </p><p>be no lasting stability in the region without resolution to </p><p>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Henry Siegman said that if </p><p>this was the consensus among Arab leaders then Washington was </p><p>not hearing this message with the kind of conviction and </p><p>urgency it merits.  He added that Arab leaders now have a </p><p>prime opportunity to bring their concerns to the attention of </p><p>President Bush.  Ambassador Wisner said it was not his </p><p>impression that there was deep dialogue between US and Arab </p><p>leaders on these issues.  He added that it would be unwise </p><p>for Arab leaders to sit on their hands while a new Iraq was </p><p>being constructed around them. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
