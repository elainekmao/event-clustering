<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>DECEMBER 17, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 17, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  TURKISH TROOPS ON IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Hurriyet/Sabah)  A high-level Turkish military </p><p>official made a statement to the British Reuters </p><p>Agency by phone, saying that Turkey has deployed </p><p>10,000-15,000 soldiers and engineers along the </p><p>Iraqi border in preparation for a possible U.S. </p><p>war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ECHR ORDERS TURKEY TO PAY INDEMNITY </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  The European Court of Human Rights </p><p>(ECHR) ruled against the Government of Turkey in </p><p>connection with six cases, including "prolonged </p><p>detention, violation of right to fair trial, </p><p>torture, death in custody and prevention of </p><p>freedom of thought" and ordered a total payment </p><p>of EUR 130,000 (approx. USD 133,000) in </p><p>reparations.  These cases included the killing by </p><p>a landmine of 16-year-old suspect Orhan Yakar, </p><p>arrested in Bingol in 1996, after Yakar was taken </p><p>to a rural area to show a PKK member\'s body. </p><p>ECHR also ordered that Turkey pay Mus resident </p><p>Makbule Kinay, whose home had been burned by </p><p>soldiers, EUR 59,000 (approx. USD 60,300) in </p><p>indemnity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  LANDMINE THREAT IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Sabah)  Turkey faces the problem of over one </p><p>million landmines planted across the Southeast. </p><p>According to the Human Rights Association (HRA), </p><p>600 people, among them children, lost their </p><p>lives, and over one thousand others were injured </p><p>by landmines over the past ten years.  Turkish </p><p>security forces swept 10,638 landmines in various </p><p>border regions by the end of 2001.  However, </p><p>Turkish Armed Forces said USD 12 million is </p><p>initially needed to remove the remaining </p><p>landmines.  Five years and USD 36 million are </p><p>needed to remove all the landmines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  CHOMSKY IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Evrensel)  U.S. writer and linguist Noam Chomsky </p><p>held a press conference in Diyarbakir on December </p><p>16 in which he said he had returned to the U.S. </p><p>in a very positive mood following his visit to </p><p>Turkey in 2001.  In answer to the question </p><p>whether or not the U.S. would launch an operation </p><p>against Iraq, Chomsky said it was not easy to </p><p>find a statement of reasons for the resolution </p><p>made by the U.N.  "No matter what the report of </p><p>weapons inspectors in Iraq is, the U.S. and the </p><p>U.K. have from the very beginning been determined </p><p>to wage a war against Iraq.  The U.N.\'s decision </p><p>clearly foresees disarmament in the region. </p><p>There are thousands of nuclear weapons in the </p><p>hands of Israel.  Saddam Hussein is not the only </p><p>problem in the region," he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  3.5 TONS OF UNPROCESSED HEROIN SEIZED IN </p><p>ELAZIG </p><p>(All papers)  In collaboration with U.S. and </p><p>Russian units, Elazig police seized 3.5 tons of </p><p>asitanhidrite in 15 plastic barrels concealed </p><p>among timber on a trailer truck headed for </p><p>Hakkari.  The truck first came to the Samsun Port </p><p>by a ferryboat that left Russia\'s Novorossisk </p><p>Port.  The value of the seized asitanhidrite, </p><p>which was reported to be associated with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK, was estimated at EUR 600,000 (approx. </p><p>USD 613,000).  In the truck, nine people were </p><p>arrested and an unlicensed pistol was </p><p>confiscated.  Five other suspects, including a </p><p>Syrian national, were arrested during ensuing </p><p>operations in Kilis and Ankara.  The 15 arrestees </p><p>were later sent to the (Elazig) State Security </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  ADANA FOREIGN TRADE CLUB </p><p>(Turkiye/Bolge/Milliyet)  The Adana Foreign Trade </p><p>Club project launched by the Adana Chamber of </p><p>Commerce (ACOC), the Adana Chamber of Industry </p><p>(ACOI) and the U.K.\'s Sheffield Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry has been shown as a model </p><p>project on the way to the EU. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
