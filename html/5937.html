EXTRAORDINARY STATUS AT ISKENDERUN PORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet: Security measures increased </p><p>in Iskenderun, the port where armed American </p><p>troops have been deployed and military equipment </p><p>has been unloaded. Officials have been warned </p><p>against sabotage and suicide attacks. The </p><p>Ministry of Health instructed hospitals in town </p><p>to stock a good quantity of Atropine, </p><p>particularly used against poisonous gas. </p><p>Iskenderun Port has been unofficially declared a </p><p>"Forbidden Zone" by the Brigade  Command who </p><p>overtook the security at the port. Protection of </p><p>US military equipment is provided by American </p><p>troops while the Turkish soldiers provide </p><p>exterior security. Americans staying in local </p><p>hotels and visiting various spots in town are </p><p>escorted by jandarma, and their security is </p><p>provided by police and soldiers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Military Movements in the Area </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet/Evrensel/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Radikal: The Commander of US Forces in </p><p>Europe, Gen. Burwell Bell, accompanied by Turkish </p><p>military officers, inspected Mersin and </p><p>Iskenderun ports yesterday and flew to Incirlik </p><p>AB by  helicopter. Cumhuriyet: The Turkish </p><p>General Staff announced that only after signing a </p><p>MOU with Washington, was military equipment </p><p>dispatched at Iskenderun port. The TGS emphasized </p><p>that the shipment did not contain any combat </p><p>components. Radikal: Based on the permission </p><p>given by the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the </p><p>US military delegation conducted inspections at </p><p>Gaziantep airport yesterday. The American </p><p>delegation undertook studies to determine what </p><p>would be needed at the airport to give services </p><p>to heavy tonnage cargo planes and to provide </p><p>secure flights. Hurriyet: Activities continue at </p><p>Iskenderun and Tasucu ports which are ready for </p><p>war ships to dock. The Iskenderun port where 522 </p><p>military vehicles, including Hummers carrying </p><p>missile batteries, were unloaded, resembles a </p><p>military headquarters. Following unloading of </p><p>military equipment, 290 US soldiers from Incirlik </p><p>AB were also dispatched to the port where </p><p>containers have been used to hide the military </p><p>equipment. Although no military equipment has </p><p>been unladed at Tasucu port, the port\'s yard has </p><p>been fenced with barbed wire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Anti-War Legal Measures </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet/Evrensel: A group of lawyers </p><p>affiliated with Tunceli Bar Association brought </p><p>charges against those responsible for breaching </p><p>the Constitution by allowing US soldiers to enter </p><p>Turkey from Mersin and Iskenderun ports. </p><p>5.  Death in Local Prison </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye: Levent Satin, 25, who was imprisoned for </p><p>theft and moved from Gaziantep prison to Adana\'s </p><p>E-type Indoor Prison to receive mental treatment </p><p>at Psychotherapy Hospital, was found dead in his </p><p>cell. An investigation was launched as the body </p><p>was taken to the forensic medicine for </p><p>examination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Foreign Christians on Trial </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye: A hearing concerning the "Love for </p><p>Messiah Jesus Christ" group in Gaziantep started </p><p>at the 2nd General Criminal Court. The group\'s </p><p>representative in Turkey, Wilber Miller, and </p><p>Gaziantep representative John Schutz left the </p><p>court without attending the trial when they ran </p><p>into press. The group\'s attorney, Mahmut Oktem, </p><p>and the plaintiff, attorney and DYP provincial </p><p>chairman, Sermet Atay attended the hearing. A </p><p>sentence of from one month to six months of </p><p>imprisonment is being sought for Miller and </p><p>Schutz for opposing the "Association Law", </p><p>"Meeting, Demonstration and Marching Law." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkish Parlimentary Human Rights Group\'s </p><p>Anti-Turkish Christian Comments Criticized </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet: The Turkish National Assembly\'s Human </p><p>Rights Commission\'s sub-committee which held </p><p>inspections in Mardin determined that Syriac </p><p>Christians could constitute a problem for the </p><p>unitary structure of Turkey in the future. The </p><p>sub-committee\'s report received adverse </p><p>reactions. CHP\'s Mardin deputy, Muharrem Dogan, </p><p>said Syriacs were not a danger but a benefit for </p><p>Turkey, and added that the sub-committee was </p><p>misinformed, there was no such danger in the </p><p>region. MP Dogan said "We grew up together with </p><p>these people, we are cohabiting. That they are a </p><p>danger for Turkey is not true. This is </p><p>discrimination, racialism and abuse of religion. </p><p>Their religion may be different. They believe in </p><p>the Bible." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Ocalan Supporters arrested </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milli Gazete: Three Ataturk University (Erzurum) </p><p>students writing pro-PKK/KADEK slogans such as </p><p>"The Apocus are coming" "Leader Apo" "Long Live </p><p>Apo, Long Live KADEK" in spray paint in three </p><p>quarters of Erzurum were arrested by anti-terror </p><p>police. The suspects were taken to Erzurum State </p><p>Security Court following their interrogation by </p><p>police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Turks Plan for possible N. Iraq Entry </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet: The Turkish Armed Forces who will enter </p><p>Northern Iraq to cope with influx of refugees and </p><p>install security equipment almost completed their </p><p>preparations. With these personnel, the number of </p><p>2nd Army affiliate troops at the border region </p><p>reached 100 thousand. The military units under </p><p>Gen. Fevzi Turkeri\'s command were inoculated </p><p>against contagious diseases. 50 thousand Turkish </p><p>soldiers are expected to enter Northern Iraq if </p><p>the Turkish Parliament  decides to join the </p><p>oepration. Jandarma General Command affiliated </p><p>jandarma units will be in charge of relief </p><p>efforts, while military units affiliated with the </p><p>land Forces Command will provide security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Siirt Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet: Prior to the March 9 by-elections where </p><p>AKP chair, Tayyip Erdogan, will run for </p><p>parliament,  Interior Minister, Abdulkadir Aksu; </p><p>Public Works and Resettlement Minister, Zeki </p><p>Ergezen, and 7 AKP MPs visited Siirt. Cumhuriyet </p><p>reports that Mr. Erdogan plans to visit his </p><p>constituency twice during the election, and will </p><p>make his first visit to Siirt on February 28 or </p><p>March 01. DEHAP who got 26,980 votes in November </p><p>3 general elections in Siirt announced that they </p><p>would cooperate with CHP in the upcoming </p><p>election. There are a total of 119,210 registered </p><p>voters in Siirt province, but only 88,397 voted </p><p>on November 3. DEHAP was the clear winner of the </p><p>November 3 elections in Siirt, but because it did </p><p>not pass the 10 percent national bar, it was </p><p>unable to elect any deputies. DEHAP\'s Deputy </p><p>Secretary General claimed if they joined CHP, CHP </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>could win the three seats in Siirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Counterfeit Iraqi Lira in Mersin </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye/Bolge: In Mersin province, the jandarma </p><p>raided a printing house, and seized 5.5 trillion </p><p>Turkish Liras ($-3.3 million) worth of </p><p>counterfeit Iraqi Dinars and 1.5 trillion Turkish </p><p>Liras (USD 900, 000 equivalent) worth of fake </p><p>detergent. 8 persons were ordered held by the </p><p>court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Fears of OHAL\'s Return </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye: Inhabitants of East and Southeast Turkey </p><p>are uncomfortable about the possibility of </p><p>declaring state of emergency in the region again </p><p>if war starts. It is also speculated that because </p><p>of the deployment of US troops at Sabiha Gokcen </p><p>Airport in Istanbul, Istanbul might become the </p><p>terrorists\' target, and in the light of such a </p><p>danger, state of emergency could be declared in </p><p>Istanbul, too. Another worry is that the innocent </p><p>Kurdish people in the region might suffer in the </p><p>combat with the PKK. Claims that the US will hire </p><p>former village guards to fight in Northern Iraq </p><p>and pay them between 2 to 4 thousand dollars has </p><p>created a bomb effect in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Local Business Boom Due to Incoming </p><p>Americans </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milli Gazete: An American delegation, in Mardin </p><p>for the modernization of the Mardin airport, is </p><p>looking for hotels to use during the possible war </p><p>on Iraq. The US delegation is reported to have </p><p>had talks with officials of the historical Erdoba </p><p>houses, Hotel Bilen in Mardin, Nezirhan </p><p>Installations in Nusaybin, and Oztopraklar Hotel </p><p>in Kiziltepe. The delegation also attempted to </p><p>hire idle factories in the Industrial Zone for </p><p>storage purposes. </p><p>14.  Alleged Mistreatment of Anti-war Protestors </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evrensel: In a press conference held by Adana\'s </p><p>HRA and Association for Assistance and Solidarity </p><p>with Inmates\' and Prisoners\' Families it was </p><p>claimed that 38 persons were imprisoned in Adana </p><p>and Ceyhan, and that the inmates were subjected </p><p>to various pressure at the E-type prison in </p><p>Adana. Wardens wanted to cut inmates\' hair and </p><p>mustaches and anyone opposed was attacked and </p><p>beaten on the soles of their feet by wardens. The </p><p>press announcement called for putting an end to </p><p>torture and hold the perpetrators accountable for </p><p>their actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. MP Denied Access to Iskenderun Port </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hurriyet: CHP\'s Hatay MP, Gokhan Durgun, who </p><p>attempted to conduct an inspection at the </p><p>Iskenderun port where US troops and military </p><p>equipment are deployed was denied access by </p><p>Turkish authorities on the grounds that they </p><p>could not guarantee his physical security. MP </p><p>Durgun said he had wanted to find out if there </p><p>was military combat material at the port as </p><p>reported in the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.
