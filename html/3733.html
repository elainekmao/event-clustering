<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005295 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR TUCKER ASKEW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT\'S IRAQ SPEECH:  JORDANIANS WELCOME MOVE </p><p>TO UNSC, FEAR WAR IS COMING, AND ASK "WHAT ABOUT ISRAEL?" </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Initial reaction in Jordan to the President\'s UNGA </p><p>speech has been mixed.  The government issued a generally </p><p>supportive statement on September 12 calling for the return </p><p>of inspectors to Iraq, and many of our GOJ interlocutors have </p><p>privately praised the forcefulness of the speech.  Those </p><p>Jordanians who view the speech in positive terms point to the </p><p>U.S.\'s renewed commitment to multilateral diplomacy as its </p><p>most important component.  However, local media and numerous </p><p>contacts outside the government have been decidedly negative. </p><p> Those critical of the speech say the President did not </p><p>convince them that a preemptive strike was necessary. </p><p>General public opinion and press commentary pointed to a </p><p>perceived "double standard" in U.S. foreign policy between </p><p>enforcement of UNSCRs on Iraq but not on Israel.  Whether </p><p>critic or admirer, however, the Jordanian public is </p><p>increasingly convinced that a U.S.-Iraq war is coming.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>PRAISING THE ART OF THE SPEECH, IF NOT ITS CONTENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On 9/12, Minister of State for Political Affairs and </p><p>Minister of Information Mohammed Adwan issued the only </p><p>official GOJ response thus far to the President\'s UNGA </p><p>speech.  After welcoming the President\'s reference to </p><p>establishing a Palestinian State in three years, Adwan said </p><p>"We also hope that President Bush\'s speech will lead to an </p><p>immediate dialogue between Iraq and the United Nations for </p><p>the implementation of all UN resolutions" including the </p><p>"immediate return of UN arms inspectors to determine whether </p><p>Iraq has weapons of mass destruction." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In a 9/14 discussion with A/PolCouns, Ashraf Zeitoon </p><p>of FonMin Muasher\'s Private Office gave a positive assessment </p><p>of the speech.  Zeitoon said that by focusing the discussion </p><p>back on the Security Council, the President made it "much </p><p>harder for the U.S.\'s international critics to say anything." </p><p> Zeitoon qualified his praise, however, noting that he and </p><p>other MFA colleagues feel that while the President had won </p><p>points among Jordanians for his renewed multilateralism, he </p><p>had not provided convincing evidence that a preemptive strike </p><p>was warranted.  Ali al-Ayed, also of the FonMin\'s Private </p><p>Office, told A/DCM on 9/15 that he understood Mubarak soon </p><p>would be making a tour of the region to drum up Arab support </p><p>for the return of inspectors.  The President\'s speech, </p><p>al-Ayed noted, had made Iraq the issue of the moment in the </p><p>GOJ, pushing aside, at least for now, the Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SOME POSITIVE REACTIONS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Samplings of other Embassy contacts also show that the </p><p>speech resonated in some quarters.  Former Iraqi Oil Minister </p><p>Issam Chalabi said he was "extremely impressed."  The speech </p><p>was "well-balanced, turned the issue around, and covered </p><p>points that were long overdue."  Chalabi was particularly </p><p>full of praise for the President\'s emphasis on the plight of </p><p>the Iraqi people under Saddam: "This was very important.  So </p><p>many democratic governments have forgotten this, as have </p><p>people in the Arab world.  They should be ashamed of </p><p>themselves."  Jamal Tahat, a telecommunications researcher, </p><p>observed that the speech "made it easier to defend the </p><p>American position. If there is going to be a war, it will be </p><p>a more rational war."  Several other business contacts also </p><p>offered a general positive reaction, noting that "anything </p><p>that reduces uncertainty is welcome." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>MEDIA NEGATIVE: U.S. WANTS WAR, WHAT ABOUT ISRAEL? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Those positive statements among Embassy contacts </p><p>notwithstanding, Jordanian media and opinionmakers almost </p><p>unanimously discussed the speech in negative terms.  Even the </p><p>government-affiliated English language Jordan Times (which is </p><p>generally very measured in its criticism of the U.S.) stated </p><p>in an editorial on 9/13 that the President "failed yet again </p><p>to show solid evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass </p><p>destruction.  His argument that Iraq is a threat to the world </p><p>remains unconvincing."  The paper went on to argue that it </p><p>was the U.S. -- not Iraq -- that posed a threat to regional </p><p>stability: "Baghdad says it does not want a war.  It will </p><p>have to demonstrate that.  That Bush wants a war, it has long </p><p>been clear.  It is not too late to deny him the chance to get </p><p>it." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Arab language daily "Al-Arab Al-Yawm," in a 9/13 </p><p>editorial was particularly critical of the perceived U.S. </p><p>"double standard" in the region: "We, the Arabs who live in </p><p>an area that the U.S. Administration is seeking to turn into </p><p>a zone of war and destruction, cannot but feel bitterness for </p><p>the double standard policy that was clearly evident in Bush\'s </p><p>speech.  He totally ignored what the Palestinian people have </p><p>been enduring for the past four months at the hands of the </p><p>Israeli troops, while showering the world with the </p><p>\'violations\' of the Iraqi regime." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Other conversations with Embassy contacts over the </p><p>past several days have keyed in on the "double standard" </p><p>issue.  Urayb Rantawi, Director of the Al-Quds Center for </p><p>Research characterized the President\'s statements on </p><p>Palestine as "the clearest U.S. statement thus far" in </p><p>support of Palestinian aspirations.  He qualified that </p><p>praise, however, by adding that "what\'s going on on the </p><p>ground, however, undermines its credibility."  Former </p><p>Jordanian Ambassador to Iraq Faleh al-Tawil told us </p><p>"attacking Iraq because of WMD is unconvincing, especially </p><p>when you don\'t do anything about Israel and its WMD." </p><p>Several other Embassy contacts asked rhetorically why the </p><p>U.S. is focused on Iraq while Israel, they feel, is guilty of </p><p>the same offenses: flaunting UNSCRs, possessing WMD, and </p><p>occupying others\' territory. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>IN ANY CASE, WAR (EVERYONE NOW BELIEVES) IS COMING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) What has solidified in the thinking of most Jordanians </p><p>-- both among critics and admirers of the President\'s speech </p><p>-- is a growing sense that war between the U.S. and Iraq is </p><p>coming.  For those who praised the speech, the direction </p><p>ahead lends itself to a straightforward interpretation. </p><p>Former Iraqi Oil Minister Chalabi summed it up succinctly </p><p>saying: "The U.S. appears truly sincere in wanting to topple </p><p>Saddam this time.  I hope that means we are nearing the end </p><p>of this tragedy."  For the critics, the U.S. challenge (or to </p><p>some "threat") to the UN to "shoulder its responsibilities" </p><p>is only a superficial repackaging of U.S. war plans. </p><p>Journalist Musa Keilani in a 9/15 opinion piece stated: "On </p><p>the surface, it looks great . . . but it is an easy task to </p><p>reject Iraqi compliance as falling short.  The new U.S. move </p><p>is deceptive and another stepping stone to military action </p><p>against Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Many of the Jordanians who praised the President\'s </p><p>speech welcomed the U.S. pledge to work with the UN in the </p><p>hope that it will give Iraq one last chance to permit </p><p>inspectors into the country and avoid military action, which </p><p>they fear would have serious consequences for Jordan.  In </p><p>contrast, the negative street and media reaction focused on </p><p>the perceived U.S. double standard in dealing with Arabs </p><p>versus Israel, a strong undercurrent in the popular Jordanian </p><p>view of regional issues across the board. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
