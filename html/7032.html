<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA PLAY - IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Colombo 550 </p><p> </p><p>1. Under the front-page headline, "CBK hits out at Bush," </p><p>the DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily, islandwide </p><p>circulation) pursues a leitmotiv that often appears in the </p><p>Sri Lankan media\'s coverage of the war:  mixing local </p><p>issues with news from Iraq.  (See reftel, which reported </p><p>that an editorial in the DAILY NEWS (government-owned </p><p>English daily, islandwide circulation) wondered why some </p><p>Sri Lankans are simultaneously pro-peace in Iraq and </p><p>"deafeningly silent" regarding peace in Sri Lanka itself.) </p><p>According to "CBK hits out," President Kumaratunga has </p><p>accused the USG of "waging war against Iraq ... while </p><p>asking Sri Lanka to go ahead with peace talks with a </p><p>terrorist organization [i.e., the LTTE]." </p><p> </p><p>2. Other English dailies are satisfied with either pix of </p><p>"smoke billows from an explosion in ... Saddam\'s guest </p><p>palace" or a "map of `Day 12.\'"  The vernacular press, in </p><p>contrast, gives heavy coverage to what one Sinhala headline </p><p>describes as "U.S. soldiers kill seven Iraqi women and </p><p>children."  The same story appears in the Tamil dailies </p><p>under headlines such as "Coalition forces fire near </p><p>checkpoint; 7 Iraqis ... killed" and "Fearing suicide </p><p>bombers, innocent civilians shot dead." </p><p> </p><p>3. Although Sri Lanka\'s English- and Tamil-medium </p><p>editorialist are silent today, a brief editorial appears in </p><p>LAKBIMA (independent Sinhala daily, islandwide coverage). </p><p>Dilating on "The principle of refusing war,"  LAKBIMA\'s </p><p>editors say: </p><p> </p><p>"Our Prime Minister has said that he is not prepared to go </p><p>on with a war that would never bring victory to us ... not </p><p>prepared to sacrifice the country\'s economy, and the future </p><p>of its children. </p><p> </p><p>"Lovers of war can never bring a solution to a problem.  We </p><p>can eradicate war only if we realize this truth." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
