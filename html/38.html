PHALANGE MILITIAMEN LOYAL TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT CONTROL ONLY THE METN, THE GEMAYEL </p><p>FIEFDOM SITUATED BETWEEN THE AREAS HELD BY </p><p>JA\'JA\'.  ALL OF THESE AREAS REMAIN TENSE BUT </p><p>CALM, EXCEPT FOR SOME ISOLATED CLASHES BETWEEN </p><p>RIVAL LF GROUPS AT DAWRA (NEAR BEIRUT PORT) ON </p><p>MORNING OF MARCH 15.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.

AT THIS SECOND MEETING, THE </p><p>RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS CHAIRED BY </p><p>MARONITE PARTRIARCH KHURAYSH, WAS ABLE TO MEET </p><p>WITH VARIOUS LF OFFICIALS, INCLUDING FOR THE </p><p>FIRST TIME JA\'JA\' HIMSELF AND HIS MAIN </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  BESIDES THE PARTRIARCH, THE </p><p>RECONCILATION COMMITTEE INCLUDES CHRISTIAN MP\'S </p><p>ELIAS HRAOUI, MICHEL MURR, KHATCHIG BABIKIAN, </p><p>GEBRANE TOK, MIKEAL DAHER, AND KHALIL ABUHAMAD. </p><p>AT THE MARCH 14 BKERKE MEETING, THEY MET WITH THE </p><p>FOLLOWING MEMBERS OF THE LF COMMAND COUNCIL: </p><p>SAMIR JA\'JA\', ELIE HOBEIKA, TONY BRIDI, CHARLES </p><p>GHOSTIN, NAOUM FARAH, ELIE ASSWAD, SAMIR TAWILE, </p><p>AND FAWZI MAHFUZ.  LF COMMANER FUAD ABU NADIR DID </p><p>NOT ATTEND, BUT HIS PREDECESSOR, FADI FREM, DID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) JUDGING FROM THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER </p><p>THE BKERKE MEETING, LITTLE PROGRESS WAS MADE </p><p>DURING THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH JA\'JA\'.  "THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN DECISON MOVEMENT," AS JA\'JA\'S GROUP NOW </p><p>OFFICIALLY CALLS ITSELF, REAFFIRMED ITS POLITICAL </p><p>NATURE, ITS DESIRE TO AVOID VIOLENCE, AND ITS AIM </p><p>OF "REINFORCING THE INDEPENDENCE AND GLOBALITY OF </p><p>CHRISTIAN DECISION ACCORDING TO DEMOCRATIC </p><p>RULES."  IN THE COMMUNIQUE, JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT ALSO </p><p>REAFFIRMED ITS RESPECT FOR EXISTING LAWS AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  IT CLAIMED THAT IT WAS </p><p>"PURELY AND UNIQUELY LEBANESE CHRISTIAN," I.E., </p><p>NOT ISRAELI BACKED.  FOLLOWING THE MEETING, </p><p>HOBEIKA CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL OF ROADBLOCKS </p><p>WHICH HAVE ISOLATED CERTAIN CHRISTIAN AREAS, MOST </p><p>NOTABLY THE ROADBLOCK ESTABLISHED BY LOYALIST </p><p>FORCES AT THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE METN </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE DOG RIVER TUNNEL ON THE </p><p>COASTAL HIGHWAY BETWEEN DUBAYYAH AND JUNNIYAH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) FOLLOWING THE BKERKE MEETING, THE </p><p>RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>PRESIDENT GEMAYEL THAT (A) JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT WAS A </p><p>MATTER WITHIN THE PHALANGE PARTY AND BETWEEN THAT </p><p>PARTY AND THE LEBANESE FORCES AND (B) THAT JA\'JA\' </p><p>HAD NO INTENTION OF LEADING A COUP D\'ETAT.  THE </p><p>RECONCILATION COMMITTEE THEN MET WITH THE </p><p>PHALANGE PARTY POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SIMULTANEOUSLY FOLLOWING THE BKERKE </p><p>MEETING, JA\'JA\' AND HIS MAJOR SUPPORTERS MET AT </p><p>THE HOME OF BASHIR GEMAYEL\'S WIDOW, SOLANGE, AND </p><p>FORMED AN "EMERGENCY COMMITTEE" COMPOSED OF ABU </p><p>NADIR, JA\'JA\', HOBEIKA, FREM, BRIDI, GHOSTIN, </p><p>KARIM PAKRADUNI, AND GEORGES ADWAN.  SO </p><p>FAR, THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>ANNOUNCED BUT NAOUM FARAH (SEPTEL) CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT IT IS AN EMBRYONIC POLITBURO OR COMMAND </p><p>COUNCIL FOR JA\'JA\'S "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) EARLIER ON MARCH 14, PRESIDENT GEMAYEL </p><p>RECEIVED GENERAL MUHAMMAD KHOLI, AN EMISSARY SENT </p><p>BY SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD REPORTEDLY TO REAFFIRM </p><p>SYRIAN SUPPORT.  IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AT THIS </p><p>POINT THAT SYRIAN VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM WILL </p><p>RETURN TO LEBANON ON MARCH 16 TO CONTINUE THE </p><p>INTERCOMMUNAL POLITICAL TALKS UNTERTAKEN LAST </p><p>MARCH 9-10 AT BIKFAYYA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IN REACTION TO JA\'JA\'S CHALLENGE, DRUZE </p><p>LEADER WALID JUMBLATT, SPEAKING FOR THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FRONT, LENT SUPPORT TO THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>AND VEHEMENTLY CRITICIZED JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT AS "AN </p><p>ISRAELI ATTEMPT TO TORPEDO THE POLITICAL ACCORD </p><p>BEING DRAWN UP UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SYRIAN </p><p>LEADERS."  THE NDF REITERATED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>"SYRIAN OPTION." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) LATE NOTE:  ACCORDING TO NAOUM FARAH (SEPTEL), </p><p>THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT" DOES,IN FACT, </p><p>SUPPORT THE REOPENING OF THE DOG RIVER TUNNEL AND </p><p>SEVERAL BRIDGES BLOCKED BY PHALANGE MILITIAMEN FROM </p><p>THE METN LOYAL TO GEMAYEL.  AS OF EARLY AFTERNOON </p><p>MARCH 15, THE LATTER HAD AGREED TO REMOVE THE </p><p>BLOCKADES AND TURN THE CHOKE POINTS OVER TO THE LAF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
