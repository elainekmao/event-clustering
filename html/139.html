<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 01048 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, PINS, PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: THE "AL-AHRAR" PARTY IN ALEXANDRIA: THE ISLAMIC RIGHT RESURGENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING </p><p>PHENOMENA  WITHIN EGYPT\'S ESTABLISHED OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS HAS BEEN THE TRANSFORMATION </p><p>WITHIN THE "LIBERALS" OR "AL-AHRAR" PARTY.   THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE 1970\'S AND EARLY 1980\'S, THE PARTY WAS PROBABLY THE </p><p>MOST BOURGEOIS AND PRO-WESTERN OF THE LEGAL OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES (IT INITIALLY EVEN SUPPORTED CAMP DAVID, SUPPORT </p><p>FOR WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN ABROGATED).  THE PARTY\'S WEEKLY </p><p>NEWSPAPER WAS WIDELY READ IN ALEXANDRIA, ESPECIALLY PRIOR </p><p>TO THE RE-PUBLICATION OF "AL-WAFD" NEWSPAPER WHICH NOW </p><p>WINS LOCAL POPULARITY CONTESTS.   HOWEVER, SINCE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, THE PARTY HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY </p><p>RADICALIZED BY A GROUP OF ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS WHO ARE </p><p>EXPANDING THEIR DOMINANCE OF THE PARTY STRUCTURE. </p><p>THE POST HAS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH A MEMBER </p><p>OF "AL-AHRAR\'S" POLITBURO WHO OPPOSES THE INCREASED </p><p>ISLAMICIZATION AND WHO HAS DESCRIBED FOR US SOME OF </p><p>THE RECENT CHANGES IN THE PARTY.  THIS SOURCE CONTINUES </p><p>TO BELIEVE THAT RELIGION FOR MANY OF EGYPT\'S </p><p>YOUNG PEOPLE IS ONLY A FAD, BUT SHE STILL COULD NOT </p><p>CONCEAL HER CONCERN OVER WHAT HAS OCCURRED WITHIN </p><p>THE "AL-AHRAR" PARTY. IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE </p><p>WHETHER THESE CHANGES WILL ALTER SIGNIFICANTLY THE </p><p>MINUTE STANDING THE "AL-AHRAR" PARTY HAS ON EGYPT\'S </p><p>POLITICAL MAP, ALTHOUGH ITS IMPACT HAS BEEN FELT IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA.  AT A MINIMUM, THE INFUSION OF DYNAMIC, </p><p>YOUNGER BLOOD INTO AN ORGANIZATION WHICH HAD ALMOST </p><p>CEASED TO EXIST POLITICALLY IS CERTAIN TO INVIGORATE </p><p>THE LOCAL POLITICAL PROCESS IN </p><p>FUTURE POPULAR COUNCIL ELECTIONS AND TO GIVE THE </p><p>SQUABBLING AND DIVIDED LOCAL NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  TRADITIONALLY, THE "AL-AHRAR" PARTY (OR "THE LIBERALS") </p><p>HAS ENJOYED ONLY A SMALL FOLLOWING IN ALEXANDRIA.  ITS </p><p>MODERATELY LEFTIST, PRO-WESTERN POLICIES HAD </p><p>CONSIDERABLE APPEAL TO BUSINESSMEN, SMALL MERCHANTS, </p><p>AND THE MIDDLE CLASS GENERALLY, BUT THESE SAME ELEMENTS </p><p>TENDED TO SUPPORT EITHER THE RULING NDP OR THE </p><p>"WAFD". </p><p>- </p><p>4.  THE POST\'S ATTENTION TO RECENT CHANGES WITHIN </p><p>"AL-AHRAR" DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT </p><p>SHAYKH SALAH ABU ISMAIL WAS PLANNING TO ADDRESS THE PARTY </p><p>FAITHFUL IN ALEXANDRIA ON SEPTEMBER 11,  A DATE </p><p>WHICH COINCIDED WITH THE PERES-MUBARAK SUMMIT. </p><p>FOR SEVERAL YEARS, ABU ISMAIL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>ARTICULATE (AND RADICAL) PROPONENTS OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>TENDENCY IN EGYPT.  ALTHOUGH HE HAS CONTINUALLY ESCHEWED </p><p>VIOLENCE, HE HAS PROMOTED A VERY STRINGENT PROGRAM </p><p>REGARDING ADOPTION OF THE "SHARIA" (ISLAMIC LAW) AND </p><p>OTHER MEASURES DESIGNED TO MAKE EGYPT INTO SOME KIND </p><p>OF ILL-DEFINED ISLAMIC STATE.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, ABU </p><p>ISMAIL AND A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS JOINED THE </p><p>"AL-AHRAR" PARTY.  ABU ISMAIL IS, IN EFFECT, THE </p><p>DRIVING FORCE IN THE PARTY BEHIND THE CHAIRMAN, MUSTAFA </p><p>KAMAL MURAD. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  CONGEN PERSONNEL RECENTLY CONTACTED MRS. RAGAA RASHAD, </p><p>AN ALEXANDRIAN LAWYER AND MEMBER OF THE PARTY\'S POLITBURO </p><p>(SHE ALSO HEADS THE LIBERALS "WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS" DEPARTMENT). </p><p>RASHAD (PLEASE PROTECT) IS A STRONG OPPONENT OF THE </p><p>RECENT CHANGES IN THE PARTY.  IN A RECENT CONVERSATION, </p><p>SHE TALKED ABOUT ABU ISMAIL\'S SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>CONVOCATION OF THE ALEXANDRIA BRANCH OF THE PARTY AND </p><p>DESCRIBED THE IMPACT OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S INROADS. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  CONERNING THE FORMER, RASHAD DECLINED TO </p><p>GIVE TOO MANY DETAILS.  SHE NOTED THAT ABU ISMAIL HAD </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED FOUR POINTS: (A) THE OPPOSITION </p><p>BOYCOTT OF THE SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS THIS FALL; </p><p>(B) THE IMPORTANCE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE "SHARIA"; </p><p>(C) CONDEMNATION OF THE TORTURE OF "ISLAMIC GAMAAT" </p><p>MEMBERS IN PRISON (NOTE: THIS IS A CONSTANT THEME IN </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PRESS, AND ESPECIALLY IN "AL-WAFD", AS </p><p>READERS OF THE CAIRO PRESS REVIEW WILL NOTE.); AND </p><p>(D) "AL-AHRAR\'S" OPPOSITION TO THE EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI </p><p>SUMMIT. </p><p>- </p><p>7.  ON THE RECENT CHANGES WITHIN THE "AL-AHRAR" PARTY, </p><p>RASHAD ARGUED THAT MANY OF THE PARTY\'S KEY PRINCIPLES </p><p>HAVE CHANGED SINCE SHAYKH ABU ISMAIL "TOOK OVER." </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, THE PARTY BELIEVED THAT THE "SHARIA" WAS </p><p>ONE OF THE SOURCES FOR LEGISLATION.  NOW, THE PARTY </p><p>HAS DETERMINED THAT "SHARIA" IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF </p><p>LEGISLATION.  EVEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, MUSTAFA </p><p>KAMAL MURAD, HAS SEEMED TO CHANGE.  RASHAD SAID THIS </p><p>OCCURRED FOLLOWING A VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA.  MURAD (WHO WAS </p><p>KNOWN IN ALEXANDRIA FOR HIS NIGHTLY BOUTS WITH JOHNNY </p><p>WALKER) IS LETTING HIS BEARD GROW AND IS BECOMING VERY </p><p>RELIGIOUS, ACCORDING TO RASHAD.  OTHER SOURCES TELL US </p><p>HE HAS BECOME VERY MORIBUND IN HIS DIRECTION OF PARTY </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND SEEMS TO HAVE ABDICATED MUCH OF HIS </p><p>AUTHORITY TO ABU ISMAIL AND HIS SUPPORTERS. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  AS FOR THE NEW PARTY MEMBERS, MRS. RASHAD SAYS THAT </p><p>THE PARTY NOW SEEMS TO CONSIST OF VARIOUS SECTS OF </p><p>MUSLIM GROUPS.  EACH GROUP, SHE ADDED, HAS A DIFFERENT </p><p>NAME, SUCH AS "THE REJECTION OF THE FORBIDDEN AND THE </p><p>REQUESTING OF FAIRNESS ASSOCIATION."  SHE CHARACTERIZED </p><p>MOST OF THEM AS "RADICALS".  MOST OF THE MEMBERS, SHE </p><p>SAID, ARE WELL-EDUCATED.  MANY ARE PROFESSIONALS SUCH </p><p>AS DOCTORS, LAWYERS, AND PHARMACISTS.   MOST OF THE WOMEN </p><p>ARE TOTALLY COVERED.  EVEN THOSE WHO ARE EDUCATED (AND </p><p>MOST OF THEM ARE, ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE) SEEM TO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE COVERED SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT </p><p>MEN AND THEREBY "COMMIT A SIN."  EXPANDING ON THIS LOGIC, </p><p>SHE SAID THAT PROPONENTS OF THIS POLICY BELIEVE THAT IF </p><p>THE WOMAN HAS PRETTY HANDS, THEN THE HANDS HAVE TO BE </p><p>COVERED.  ATTRACTIVE EYES ALSO HAVE TO BE COVERED, EITHER </p><p>BY WEARING GLASSES OR A VEIL.  EVEN PHOTOGRAPHS </p><p>OF PEOPLE WHICH USED TO DECORATE PARTY OFFICES HAVE </p><p>BEEN REMOVED BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED </p><p>TABOO, ACCORDING TO RASHAD.  IN A RELATED INCIDENT, SHE </p><p>REPORTED THAT ABU ISMAIL\'S DEPUTY, SHAYKH YUSIF AL-BADRI </p><p>(AKA YOUSSEF EL BADRY) WAS ONCE INFURIATED BECAUSE </p><p>"AL-AHRAR" NEWSPAPER HAD PICTURED "NAKED WOMEN" ON </p><p>ONE OF ITS PAGES.  MRS. RASHAD DISCOVERED LATER THAT </p><p>BY NAKED WOMEN, HE MEANT WOMEN WHOSE HAIR WAS NOT COVERED. </p><p>MRS. RASHAD HAS, HERSELF, COME UNDER PRESSURE TO WEAR THE </p><p>VEIL, BUT SHE HAS THUS FAR SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED. </p><p>- </p><p>9.  ASKED FOR HER VIEWS ON THE CURRENT APPEAL OF ISLAM </p><p>TO EGYPT\'S YOUNG PEOPLE, RASHAD RECITED REASONS MENTIONED </p><p>BY MANY IN THE COUNTRY\'S SECULAR POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PRESSURES ARE CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL, SHE SAID.  NEVERTHELESS, SHE </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER THE ALL OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO WEAR </p><p>BEARDS AND CLAIM TO BE RELIGIOUS ARE </p><p>AS DEEPLY COMMITTED AS THEY STATE. </p><p>SHE RECALLED THE STORY OF A RELATIVE WHO </p><p>WAS A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE "SUNNI" (IN THIS CONTEXT, </p><p>"SUNNI" MEANS RELIGIOUSLY DEVOUT BEARDED PEOPLE) GROUPS. </p><p>HE  FELL IN LOVE WITH A GIRL WHO WAS NOT </p><p>VEILED AND EVENTUALLY LEFT THE GROUP, SHAVED HIS BEARD, </p><p>AND ADOPTED A DECIDEDLY SECULAR LIFE STYLE. </p><p>- </p><p>10.  BIO NOTE:  RAGAA RASHAD HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVE IN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS.  IN THE LATTER CONTEXT, </p><p>SHE HAS ADVOCATED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMITTEE IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA TO DEFEND WOMEN\'S RIGHTS.  SHE HAS PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCES ABROAD AND, </p><p>LOCALLY, HAS LECTURED TO THE MUSLIM YOUTH ASSOCIATION </p><p>ABOUT CITIZENS\' RIGHTS.  A POLITICAL MODERATE, SHE IS </p><p>A LAWYER AND CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA\'S GUMRUK DISTRICK.  TWO LOCAL ISSUES OF CURRENT </p><p>INTEREST TO HER ARE SOLUTION OF THE CITY\'S ENORMOUS </p><p>SEWERAGE PROBLEM THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND </p><p>THE CONSTRUCTION OF DAY CARE NURSERIES TO HELP WORKING </p><p>WOMEN PLACE THEIR CHILDREN DURING THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
