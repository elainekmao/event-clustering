<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LIMA 04116 </p><p> </p><p>DIA FOR OA-5/OS-1D/DB-6D2/JSI-4B/DB-3C1 </p><p>DEA FOR OF, PS, OC, OI </p><p>USCINCSO ALSO FOR POLAD JOHN YOULE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: 03/29/88 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PE </p><p>SUBJECT:  PERU:  CONGRESSIONAL REPORT ON TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 42378 </p><p>-     (B) 87 LIMA 5659 </p><p>-     (C) 87 LIMA 6577 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING IS PERU PORTION OF DEPARTMENT\'S NEW </p><p>ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM (REF A). </p><p>REFS B AND C CONTAIN MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON </p><p>PERUVIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF TERRORISM IN 1980, </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES HAVE </p><p>RESULTED IN A DEATH TOLL ESTIMATED AT OVER 10,000. </p><p>DURING 1987, PERU CONTINUED TO CONFRONT TWO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE LARGER GROUP, KNOWN AS </p><p>"SENDERO LUMINOSO" ("SHINING PATH"), KILLED AT </p><p>LEAST 600 PERSONS IN 1987.  ITS VICTIMS RANGED </p><p>FROM PEASANT OPPONENTS TO GOVERNMENT AND PARTY </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THE SECURITY FORCES.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>SENDERO CARRIED OUT NUMEROUS BOMBINGS AND BLACKOUTS. </p><p>DURING ONE BLACKOUT IN NOVEMBER 1987, SENDERO </p><p>DETONATED A BOMB IN FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, </p><p>CAUSING MINOR MATERIAL DAMAGE.  THE SMALLER  "TUPAC </p><p>AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" (MRTA) ALSO WAS ACTIVE </p><p>DURING 1987, KILLING AS MANY AS 20 PERSONS AND </p><p>CARRYING OUT NUMEROUS BOMBINGS.  THE MRTA ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS BOMBED THE USG INSTALLATIONS </p><p>AND U.S. COMPANIES, CAUSING MINOR </p><p>MATERIAL DAMAGES (BUT NO PERSONAL INJURIES).  NO </p><p>FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS IN </p><p>PERU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO MAKE IMPORTANT ARRESTS </p><p>OF ALLEGED TERRORISTS DURING 1987, INCLUDING HIGH- </p><p>RANKING MEMBERS OF THE MRTA.  THE GOVERNMENT NONETHE- </p><p>LESS WAS UNABLE TO WEAKEN SENDERO SIGNIFICANTLY, AND </p><p>SENDERO APPEARS TO HAVE ENLARGED ITS AREA OF OPERATIONS </p><p>DURING THE PAST YEAR.  PARTICULARLY WORRISOME IS </p><p>SENDERO\'S EXPANSION INTO THE COCA-PRODUCING AREAS OF </p><p>THE JUNGLE, LEADING THE GOVERNMENT TO CHARGE THAT </p><p>SENDERO IS COOPERATING WITH NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. </p><p>THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE IN SOME INSTANCES; IT IS </p><p>CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT SENDERO HAS SOUGHT TO PORTRAY </p><p>ITSELF AS DEFENDING PEASANT COCA GROWERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  JUDICIAL EFFORTS AGAINST TERRORISM CONTINUE TO </p><p>MOVE SLOWLY.  THERE IS A HUGE BACKLOG IN PERUVIAN </p><p>COURTS, AND TERRORISM SUSPECTS FREQUENTLY ARE DETAINED </p><p>FOUR YEARS PENDING TRIAL.  FEWER THAN 50 PERSONS WERE </p><p>CONVICTED OF TERRORISM DURING 1987.  AMONG THE CASES </p><p>CURRENTLY BEING TRIED ARE 15 PERSONS ACCUSED OF THE </p><p>JUNE 26, 1986 BOMBING OF THE CUZCO TRAIN STATION, </p><p>DURING WHICH TWO AMERICANS AND SEVEN OTHER FOREIGNERS </p><p>WERE KILLED, AND SEVERAL AMERICANS WERE WOUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SENDERO DOES NOT APPEAR TO RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT </p><p>FROM ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE COLLECTED FUNDS ON BEHALF OF SENDERO, </p><p>BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THESE FUNDS ARE CHANNELED </p><p>TO SENDERO.  THE INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, </p><p>A GROUP OF MAOIST PARTIES HEADQUARTERED IN LONDON, </p><p>PERIODICALLY ISSUES MANIFESTOS SUPPORTING SENDERO. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CLAIMS OF CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>MRTA SURFACE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PERUVIAN PRESS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN THAT AT LEAST ONE MRTA </p><p>LEADER TRAVELED RECENTLY TO NICARAGUA BUT HAS NOT </p><p>DEMONSTRATED OR CLAIMED THAT THESE COUNTRIES PROVIDED </p><p>ANY MATERIAL SUPPORT TO THE MRTA.  THE MRTA DOES HAVE </p><p>CLOSE TIES TO THE M-19 TERRORISTS OF COLOMBIA AND </p><p>THE ALFARO VIVE CARAJO OF ECUADOR.  IT IS LIKELY THAT </p><p>THE MRTA HAS ACQUIRED ARMS FROM ONE OR BOTH OF THESE </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  PERU GIVES NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TO THE PLO, BUT </p><p>THE PLO HAS HAD AN INFORMATION OFFICE IN PERU SINCE 1979. </p><p>PERU DOES NOT ACCORD OFFICIAL STATUS TO THE SALVADORAN </p><p>FMLN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  PERU RECEIVED NO EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR TERRORISTS </p><p>DURING 1987.  IN 1986, PERU DEPORTED TO ECUADOR AN </p><p>ECUADOREAN CITIZEN ACCUSED BY HIS GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  PERU DID NOT </p><p>INITIATE ANY EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR TERRORISM IN </p><p>1987. </p><p> </p><p>10.  PERU HAS NOT ASSISTED, TRAINED, OR PROVIDED </p><p>SANCTUARY TO FOREIGN TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>WATSON </p><p></p></div>
