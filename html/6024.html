<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p>CAIRO POL FOR JMAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, PINS, EFIN, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  BUHARI ON INTER-COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, THE </p><p>ECONOMY AND FOREIGN POLICY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a lengthy January 30 meeting with </p><p>the Ambassador, ANPP Presidential candidate Maj. Gen. </p><p>(Ret.) Muhammadu Buhari shared his plans for winning the </p><p>April election and elaborated on the reported rapprochement </p><p>between him and former military ruler Ibrahim Babangida. </p><p>Buhari gave his views on communal conflict, the economy, </p><p>Nigeria\'s role in West Africa, and the country\'s </p><p>relationship with the U.S.  Despite Christian antipathy </p><p>toward Buhari, the Northern Muslim Presidential hopeful </p><p>thought former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo\'s presence </p><p>on his ticket would begin to attract support in the </p><p>predominantly Christian South.  While Buhari questioned the </p><p>wisdom of Nigerian peacekeeping deployments when government </p><p>finances are in disarray, he acknowledged that regional </p><p>stability was of paramount importance.  Nigeria under </p><p>Buhari therefore could be counted on to help maintain peace </p><p>and security in the sub-region.  The Ambassador emphasized </p><p>Nigeria\'s importance to African stability and prosperity. </p><p>He also assured Buhari of the USG\'s commitment to work with </p><p>any democratically elected government.  Sule Y. Hamma, the </p><p>National Coordinator for the Buhari campaign, also attended </p><p>the meeting. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>STRANGE BEDFELLOWS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a 90 minute meeting with Ambassador Jeter on </p><p>January 30, Buhari said he would win the election by </p><p>"working from the ground up" in every state to engage the </p><p>ordinary Nigerian.  When asked about the Christian- </p><p>dominated South, Buhari said his Vice Presidential </p><p>candidate, former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, a </p><p>Christian from the Southeast, would be the "key" to his </p><p>victory.  While he recognized that religion worked against </p><p>him in the South, Buhari thought this difficulty could be </p><p>surmounted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) When Ambassador brought up the reported mid-January </p><p>rapprochement between Buhari and Babangida, Buhari became </p><p>palpably agitated.  Buhari said he met Babangida in Sokoto </p><p>where the traditional leader of all Nigerian Muslims, the </p><p>Sultan of Sokoto, encouraged the two men to make amends. </p><p>Though the two supposedly parted on good terms, Buhari </p><p>still seemed miffed.  Since Babangida had wronged him (the </p><p>1985 coup and Buhari\'s nearly four-year incarceration), </p><p>Buhari felt it was incumbent on Babangida to be contrite. </p><p>Nonetheless and despite their troubled history, Buhari </p><p>expected IBB\'s public support. Buhari said, however, he did </p><p>not expect his former rival to help finance his campaign, </p><p>although he would be grateful if he did. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>COMMUNAL CONFLICT AND THE POLITICIZATION OF RELIGION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Buhari castigated President Obasanjo\'s handling of </p><p>communal violence.  Buhari said none of the recent </p><p>outbreaks in Jos and Kaduna was large enough to warrant </p><p>military intervention.  The retired general gave three </p><p>levels of police engagement before the government should </p><p>consider using the army.  First, riot police, armed only </p><p>with batons, should be called to disperse crowds and keep </p><p>the peace.  If ineffective, police with firearms should be </p><p>called.  If neither prove effective in quelling violence, </p><p>then Mobile Police (MOPOL), with their superior training </p><p>and firepower, should be deployed.  Only after ratcheting </p><p>up civilian police deployment should the military be </p><p>summoned.  Citing the 2001 massacres in Benue, Buhari </p><p>criticized Obasanjo for being too quick to "use the </p><p>sledgehammer" of the military.  Buhari said Nigeria needed </p><p>an organized approach to containing communal violence and </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Noting that communal strife is sometimes based in </p><p>religious conflicts and expressing USG concerns over the </p><p>politicization of religion, Ambassador asked Buhari about a </p><p>statement attributed to him in which he called on Muslims </p><p>to vote only for Muslims.  Showing agitation again, Buhari </p><p>called the attribution a misrepresentation then provided </p><p>his version of what happened.  Attending a book launch in </p><p>Sokoto last April, Buhari told the audience that before the </p><p>advent of British colonialism, Shari\'a was the law of the </p><p>North.  Even during British rule, Shari\'a remained part of </p><p>the North\'s legal fabric.  Speaking in Hausa, Buhari told </p><p>his Sokoto audience that under Shari\'a, their area had been </p><p>stable and peaceful.  Now that Shari\'a had found its way </p><p>back into the Nigerian legal system, he implored Nigerians </p><p>to vote for candidates who would uphold their traditional </p><p>values.  Buhari said a reporter, for "This Day", who </p><p>neither spoke Hausa nor was present, misquoted him in an </p><p>article published in "This Day" on the book launch. </p><p>According to Buhari, when the reporter was subsequently </p><p>asked why he said Buhari called on Muslims to vote only for </p><p>Muslims the reporter replied the statement was what "he </p><p>thought (Buhari) meant." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Buhari said he had no interest in politicizing </p><p>religion and that he wanted to avoid election-related </p><p>violence.  He was interested in signing an electoral Code </p><p>of Conduct and he liked the idea of publicly condemning </p><p>political violence in a joint statement with the other </p><p>parties.  Buhari thought the Independent Election </p><p>Commission (INEC) should coordinate such a statement. </p><p>(NOTE: In a published statement a week later, Buhari called </p><p>on his supporters to eschew violence in the election </p><p>campaigns.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>BLAME OBASANJO FOR FOUNDERING ECONOMY </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Turning to the economy, Buhari condemned Obasanjo\'s </p><p>lack of leadership.  "Despite receiving more revenue than </p><p>any previous government, (Obasanjo) has failed," Buhari </p><p>argued.  Buhari cited government waste and corruption as </p><p>primary causes of Nigeria\'s economic woes.  Expressing </p><p>disgust with the Obasanjo Administration, Buhari said "We </p><p>don\'t need 25 Ministers and 60 Advisers with 5-10 cars </p><p>each.  We are too wasteful."  He then wondered how Obasanjo </p><p>could justify such expenses when the GON "cannot afford to </p><p>pay soldiers and police." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Buhari said his Administration would immediately </p><p>reform the GON.  Ambassador noted that 80% of the GON\'s </p><p>budget in 2002 went to civil service salaries and </p><p>maintaining the government.  Sule Hamma responded by saying </p><p>a Buhari government would monetize many of the entitlements </p><p>going to senior civil servants.  For example, instead of </p><p>providing cars and drivers or residences and household </p><p>staff for senior officials, the GON would increase their </p><p>salaries.  This would reduce administrative costs by </p><p>reducing the number of GON employees and allowing the GON </p><p>to function more cost efficiently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Buhari said reforming the petroleum industry was </p><p>also high on his list of priorities.  He pointed to massive </p><p>inefficiencies under the current government and questioned </p><p>why refineries were idle and in disrepair.  He wondered </p><p>aloud whether official corruption had a hand in this, </p><p>asking if "Abacha was once blamed for this, who is </p><p>responsible now?"  Buhari also questioned the slow </p><p>development of Nigeria\'s natural gas fields, noting that </p><p>Nigeria has no more trains today than it did in 1984. </p><p>(COMMENT: This, obviously, is not true.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) On a more positive note, Buhari thought Nigeria </p><p>and the Gulf of Guinea region could provide the United </p><p>States with a more reliable supply of petroleum than the </p><p>Persian Gulf States.  In recognition of this potential, he </p><p>hoped U.S. companies would share in the costs of increasing </p><p>Nigeria\'s production capacity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>GIVE US DEBT RELIEF BUT NO IMF </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Asked how he would handle Nigeria\'s debt and </p><p>issues of economic reform, Buhari again maligned the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration\'s performance.  The President had </p><p>been completely ineffective in gaining relief for Nigeria\'s </p><p>foreign debt, he declared.  Buhari said Obasanjo had </p><p>forgotten the lessons of his term as military Head of State </p><p>and was, once again, leading Nigeria down the road to </p><p>greater debt and insolvency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Calling on the international community to help </p><p>Nigeria with its debt, Buhari said, "Unless creditor states </p><p>help us, we cannot develop."  The Ambassador noted the USG </p><p>holds less than USD 1 billion of Nigeria\'s USD 30 billion </p><p>debt.  Because of its small portfolio, USG leverage on </p><p>other creditors was correspondingly slight.  Moreover, the </p><p>USG and more significant creditors would not take up </p><p>Nigeria\'s cause until Nigeria clearly enacted reform.  If </p><p>Nigeria hoped to get relief, it would have to make visible </p><p>reforms enhancing transparency, tackling corruption and </p><p>increasing accountability.  The GON would have to renew its </p><p>formal arrangement with the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Buhari and Hamma reacted negatively to the </p><p>prospect of another round of IMF negotiations.  Hamma </p><p>called the IMF\'s structural adjustment programs a "policy </p><p>of impoverishment."  He remarked that the IMF based its </p><p>advice on numbers cooked up in Washington and New York.  He </p><p>said the IMF should devise their programs for economic </p><p>revitalization using case specific information and keeping </p><p>in mind a particular country\'s political and socio-economic </p><p>context.  Buhari interjected that, during his term as </p><p>military Head of State, he neither followed IMF </p><p>recommendations to devalue the Naira nor attempted to </p><p>liberalize the economy.  Ambassador Jeter told Buhari that </p><p>before granting any sort of relief, creditor states would </p><p>require credible reform, and the IMF\'s stamp of approval </p><p>would lend credibility.  Finally, Ambassador said debt </p><p>relief would only be possible if the GON demonstrated that </p><p>the money saved would lead to poverty reduction among the </p><p>rural and urban poor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WARY OF PRIVATIZATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Buhari expressed misgivings about privatization. </p><p>He was uncomfortable with the privatization of some state- </p><p>owned enterprises.  In all cases there was a need for </p><p>competent regulatory agencies to prevent the "drive for </p><p>profit from wrecking the economy", and further </p><p>impoverishing the people.  Buhari felt that, in the end, </p><p>good regulation would attract more capital than premature </p><p>privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>GON FINANCIAL WOES WILL LIMIT BUT NOT END FOREIGN </p><p>DEPLOYMENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Turning to foreign policy, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>characterized Nigeria as the "indispensable player in West </p><p>African security" and expressed worry over the fate of an </p><p>ECOWAS force in Cote d\'Ivoire that did not have Nigerian </p><p>military support.  Buhari asked that the USG "understand </p><p>the reality of the Nigerian economy."  Calling Nigeria </p><p>"bankrupt", Buhari said the country could not afford to </p><p>expend resources on foreign ventures when there was so much </p><p>work to be done at home.  However, Buhari noted that when </p><p>"absolutely necessary" Nigeria would act to help insure </p><p>sub-regional stability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Buhari took pains to assure the Ambassador he had </p><p>no intention of exploiting Nigeria\'s religious divide as an </p><p>election issue. However, Buhari has waited a very long time </p><p>to clear his name regarding the "vote Muslim" statement, </p><p>which will make his explanation seem like an election ploy. </p><p>Convinced he has a lock on the Northern electorate, Buhari </p><p>hopes he can win by convincing Southerners that he is not a </p><p>religious bigot, but a force for reform in government. </p><p>However, his formulae for getting the government and the </p><p>economy back on track appear out-dated and statist. </p><p>Buhari\'s reputation for fighting corruption is second to </p><p>none in Nigeria.  His antipathy for the IMF probably </p><p>indicates an inability to work with that institution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Overall, Buhari is optimistic about his election </p><p>prospects.  Despite his claims to the contrary, most </p><p>Southerners and Christians believe he is an instrument of </p><p>the North.  Many also find his staunch support for Sharia </p><p>worrisome.  While he did not come across as an extremist, </p><p>he will be portrayed as one by his opponents in the South. </p><p>His reputation as a stern disciplinarian will prove a </p><p>double-edged sword, drawing support from those who feel </p><p>Nigeria is drifting without purpose but pushing those who </p><p>believe that Nigeria has more freedom under Obasanjo </p><p>despite the incumbent\'s shortcomings.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
