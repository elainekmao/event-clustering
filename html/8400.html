<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR DAS MOLLY WILLIAMSON </p><p>OSD FOR ORHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EAID, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE A HOT </p><p>TICKET </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2998 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary:  Surprising local organizers, reservations </p><p>for a June 5 Iraq Reconstruction conference are flooding in </p><p>from throughout the region.  Confirmed bookings have already </p><p>exceeded the organizers\' rosiest predictions, even with a </p><p>sticker price three times the going rate for conferences in </p><p>Amman.  Excellent word of mouth and a speakers list that </p><p>includes most major Iraq contractors, ORHA officials, and </p><p>international relief agencies have combined to generate </p><p>interest in the conference.  The intense interest reflects an </p><p>almost bottomless demand in the private sector for </p><p>information about the contracting process and about </p><p>commercial opportunities in Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>CONFERENCE COMES OF AGE </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  As reported reftel, Jordan\'s AmCham, JABA, has been </p><p>working with three sister associations to organize a </p><p>conference on Iraq reconstruction.  The one-day conference, </p><p>originally planned as a modest gathering to listen to USAID </p><p>officials responsible for Baghdad describe the contracting </p><p>process, has quickly blossomed into an ambitious program </p><p>touching on all aspects of reconstruction and business </p><p>opportunities in Iraq.  The program will also address </p><p>Jordan\'s comparative advantages as a gateway to Iraq and as a </p><p>source for partnerships with foreign investors who want a </p><p>knowledgeable local interlocutor to represent their interests </p><p>and get them into the Iraq market. </p><p> </p><p>IMPRESSIVE SPEAKERS LIST </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  JABA has recruited speakers from the senior ranks of </p><p>the GOJ, the Ambassador, and the Jordanian Ambassador in </p><p>Washington (who will appear live via digital video conference </p><p>to close the program) for different program sessions.  In </p><p>addition, they have commitments from ORHA\'s economic </p><p>development team, USAID officials responsible for Iraq, and </p><p>representatives from Bechtel, ABT, Creative Associates, </p><p>Parsons-Brinkerhoff, UNDP, WFP, WHO, Halliburton, and the </p><p>McKinsey Group to present at the conference. </p><p> </p><p>INTEREST OVERWHELMING </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Organizers originally planned for 200-400 attendees. </p><p> They received over 100 confirmations the day the conference </p><p>was announced.  As of May 28, with over a week to go before </p><p>the conference, over 430 confirmations have been received. </p><p>In addition to many key Jordanian businesses, reservations </p><p>have come in from Dubai, Kuwait, Bulgaria, and other </p><p>countries, and JABA has received expressions of interest from </p><p>businesses in the West Bank, Israel, and Egypt, among others. </p><p> Attendees seem undaunted by the price tag - at $134 for </p><p>organization members and $261 for non-members, about three </p><p>times the going rate for such events in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  The intense interest generated by this conference </p><p>surprised virtually everyone involved.  Local businesses have </p><p>expressed frustration since combat operations ended in Iraq </p><p>over the lack of information about business and contracting </p><p>opportunities, expectations, and procedures.  This conference </p><p>should help to address some of those questions, and with luck </p><p>will generate interest in Jordan as a gateway to Iraq.  The </p><p>sizable positive response from throughout the region and </p><p>beyond also hints at the voracious demand for information </p><p>that will likely continue in the region for the foreseeable </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  We will be working with the GOJ and private sector </p><p>following the conference to explore ways to capitalize on the </p><p>success of the June 5 event - through trade missions, </p><p>investment promotion conferences in other regional capitals </p><p>(modeled on the successful FTA promotional events from </p><p>December 2002), and similar follow up. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
