<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, AR, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ARGENTINA:  ITALY\'S APPROACH RESEMBLES OURS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00713  121722Z </p><p>REF: STATE 21899 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M C THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>1.    THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE.  SEE PARA 9. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) SUMMARY:  ON FEB 11, EMBOFFS CALLED ON COUNSELOR </p><p>GIORGIO DI PIETROGIACOMO, MFA\'S OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR SOUTH </p><p>AMERICA, TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER RUCKAUF IN BOTH WASHINGTON AND </p><p>ROME.  ITALY HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ARGENTINA BUT IS </p><p>NOT PREPARED TO PROVIDE BILATERAL ASSISTANCE UNTIL THE GOA </p><p>SATISFIES IMF CRITERIA.  MEANWHILE, THE GOI IS PROVIDING AID </p><p>TO ITALIANS LIVING IN ARGENTINA, SHORING UP SECURITY AT ITS </p><p>MISSION, AND NOMINATING A PROMINENT FINANCE OFFICIAL TO AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL "FRIENDS OF ARGENTINA" COMMITTEE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) ITALY\'S INTEREST IN ARGENTINA STEMS FROM THE FACT </p><p>THAT ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF ARGENTINA\'S CITIZENS ARE OF ITALIAN </p><p>ORIGIN, PIETROGIACOMO SAID.  ITALIAN PASSPORT HOLDERS </p><p>NUMBERED 610,000, WHILE THOSE WITH THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE </p><p>ITALIAN CITIZENSHIP WERE ESTIMATED AT 10-15 MILLION.  ITALY </p><p>MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY AND NINE CONSULATES IN ARGENTINA.  IN A </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN RUCKAUF AND THE HEAD OF ITALY\'S CONFERENCE OF </p><p>REGIONAL PRESIDENTS (WHO ARE ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO U.S. </p><p>GOVERNORS), BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD SEEK TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE LOT OF ITALIANS (AND ARGENTINES) IN ARGENTINA, </p><p>NOT FACILITATE IMMIGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) BECAUSE ITALY IS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPOSED IN </p><p>ARGENTINA, THE GOI IS CONCERNED THAT ALL INTERNATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00713  121722Z </p><p>INVESTMENTS BE TREATED EQUITABLY AND IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER. </p><p> SACE, EQUIVALENT TO THE U.S. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK, HAS 675M </p><p>USD IN EXPOSURE.  OF THIS, 103M OF PAYMENTS COMING DUE IN </p><p>NEXT FEW MONTHS.  SACE VOTED ON FEB 4 TO RESCHEDULE THESE </p><p>PAYMENTS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE GOI\'S QUERY ABOUT THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT RULES ON BANKRUPTCY, RUCKAUF RESPONDED THAT THEY </p><p>INTENDED TO REVISE THEM.  IN OUR FEB 8 CONVERSATION, </p><p>PIETROGIACOMO REPORTED HAVING RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THEY </p><p>WERE DOING SO. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) PIETROGIACOMO SAID THAT THE GOI HAD OFFERED </p><p>ARGENTINA ITALY\'S SUPPORT.  AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, THE GOI </p><p>AGREED WITH THE IMF\'S TOUGH LINE THAT ARGENTINA\'S CURRENT </p><p>ECONOMIC PLAN IS INSUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY EITHER BILATERAL OR </p><p>MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE.  ONCE ARGENTINA HAS AN AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE IMF AND PROVIDES THE GOI WITH A DETAILED REFORM </p><p>PLAN, A BILATERAL AID PACKAGE WOULD BE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U) IN JANUARY, ITALY INCREASED A FUND IT MAINTAINS FOR </p><p>HELPING ITS CITIZENS RESIDENT ABROAD.  OF 20M EUROS NOW </p><p>ALLOTTED TO THE FUND, 10M EUROS WERE SLOTTED FOR ITALIANS IN </p><p>ARGENTINA.  THIS MONEY WOULD COVER BASIC NEEDS FOR THE POOR </p><p>AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ESTABLISHING SMALL AND MEDIUM </p><p>ENTERPRISES THAT COULD CREATE NEW JOBS.  THE GOI HAS ALSO </p><p>SENT MEDICINE TO ARGENTINA. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) BECAUSE THE GOI IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY </p><p>RISKS INHERENT IN THE TUMULTUOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, IT </p><p>HAS INCREASED PRECAUTIONS AT ITS FACILITIES IN ARGENTINA. </p><p>PIETROGIACOMO NOTED THAT, FORTUNATELY, MILITARY TAKEOVER IS </p><p>NO LONGER AN OPTION FOR A TROUBLED LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00713  121722Z </p><p>WHAT MAKES DUHALDE STRONG IS THE LACK OF ALTERNATIVES TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) RUCKAUF REQUESTED THAT ITALY BE REPRESENTED IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE SUPPORTING ARGENTINA THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH AND PM BLAIR WERE ORGANIZING.  THE ITALIANS PROPOSED </p><p>PROFESSOR TANZI, UNDERSECRETARY FOR FINANCE AT THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.  PROF. TANZI WORKED FOR THE IMF FOR MANY </p><p>YEARS AND KNOWS ARGENTINA WELL.  HE IS ALSO WELL KNOWN TO THE </p><p>ARGENTINES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  PIETROGIACOMO ASKED FOR READOUTS </p><p>OF THIS WEEK\'S CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN MINISTER OF ECONOMY </p><p>REMES LENICOV AND  U.S. TREASURY AND IMF OFFICIALS.  POST </p><p>WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THE </p><p>MFA. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00713 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
