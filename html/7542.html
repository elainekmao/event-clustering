<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY MARKETS ENJOY A QUIET BUT POSITIVE WEEK </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Turkish markets rose steadily, if not spectacularly, </p><p>this week.  The lira strengthened from TL 1.65 million/dollar </p><p>at the end of last week to TL 1.60 at the close of this </p><p>morning\'s trading session.  Meanwhile, yields on the </p><p>benchmark 4/28/04 t-bill fell from 64.39 to 57.72 percent, </p><p>and the stock market rose about 6.5 percent to 11,229. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Analysts attributed this week\'s improvement to a </p><p>reduction in anxiety over Iraq -- and reports that Turkey\'s </p><p>crucial tourism industry may therefore rebound quickly -- </p><p>combined with investors more fully pricing in IMF and U.S. </p><p>assistance.  Investors remain concerned about the </p><p>government\'s commitment to the reform program, along with its </p><p>replacement of key economic technocrats with party loyalists, </p><p>but are now less concerned about the government\'s ability to </p><p>roll over its domestic debt in the short-term than they were </p><p>3-4 weeks ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Senior government officials are continuing their </p><p>positive spin campaign, with Prime Minister Erdogan </p><p>announcing today that Turkey\'s exports rose 34.5 percent </p><p>(through April 15) compared to the same period last year, and </p><p>might reach as high as $50 billion for the year.  Separately, </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan said econoimc indicators suggested </p><p>the economy had begun to improve, though he provided no </p><p>details.  (Note:  Treasury U/S Oztrak, who will leave office </p><p>today, told us earlier in the week that the economy appeared </p><p>to have weakened significantly in the second half of March, </p><p>perhaps because of the Iraq war, but that Treasury hoped it </p><p>would quickly rebound.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  Markets have improved considerably since </p><p>their lows on March 24-25 (just before the announcement of </p><p>the $1 billion in potential U.S. assistance), when t-bill </p><p>rates hit 73.5 percent and the lira was trading at TL 1.75 </p><p>million/dollar.  On the other hand, t-bill rates remain </p><p>several percentage points higher than they were during the </p><p>post-election rally in November, and in fact are higher than </p><p>they were during the April 2002 market rally.  The question </p><p>remains whether the government can instill enough market </p><p>confidence to bring interest rates down further and -- most </p><p>importantly -- avoid the mini-shocks that keep sending rates </p><p>back up. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
