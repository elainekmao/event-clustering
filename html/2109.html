<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002750 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL, AF/W AND AF/RA </p><p>AF/W FOR PARKS, EPSTEIN </p><p>DRL FOR TOMLYANOVICH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PREF, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BENUE UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2708 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge Timothy Andrews, for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  accounts by press and diplomatic personnel, often </p><p>sourced to credible eyewitnesses, basically corroborate </p><p>reftel account.  The destruction appears to be more </p><p>widespread than was initially reported.  British High </p><p>Commission personnel evacuated DFID staff from Makurdi </p><p>yesterday.  One DFID staff member reported "many" charred </p><p>vehicles and bodies strewn on the highway south of Makurdi. </p><p>Internally displaced persons confirmed the path of the Army </p><p>units involved in this action, adding that most villages </p><p>along the highway between Katsina-Ala and Zaki Biam were </p><p>destroyed.  The medium-sized town of Zaki Biam is reported to </p><p>have been essentially destroyed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Ambassador Jeter spoke to Governor Akume of Benue, </p><p>who claims to have internally displaced persons from the area </p><p>number well over 100,000.  Given the density of the rural </p><p>population in Benue and Taraba this number could be accurate. </p><p> These are in addition to approximately 60,000 persons who </p><p>fled the conflict in Nasarawa and Taraba.  The director of </p><p>the ICRC in Lagos indicated the Red Cross would conduct a </p><p>field study this weekend of DP settlements in Benue and </p><p>Taraba, and would report the findings to us on October 30. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Comment:  While we cannot yet gauge the full </p><p>dimensions of this situation, we wanted to alert the </p><p>Department to the possibly severe humanitarian challenge. </p><p>The violence has subsided for now.  Out of the smoke and ash, </p><p>the weight of the emerging evidence points to army brutality. </p><p> Media and official sources disagree on which Army units may </p><p>have been involved.  Claims from some quarters that those </p><p>responsible were anti-Tiv militiamen do not appear credible. </p><p>Many here, while unhappy about the dimensions of the Army\'s </p><p>actions, felt that the FG needed to send a strong signal </p><p>regarding the effects of killing soldiers, who are the final </p><p>guarantors--if also occasionally the violators--of civil </p><p>order in Nigeria.  It is, however, uncertain from what level </p><p>of the military or Federal Government the order to proceed </p><p>was given.  Equally uncertain is what the order said about </p><p>use of lethal force.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
