<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002372 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 20, </p><p>continue to focus on developments in Iraq.  Reports </p><p>highlight the arrest of the former Iraqi Minister of </p><p>Finance and the withdrawal of the U.S. Marines as they </p><p>handed over the civilian management of Iraq to the </p><p>U.S. army.  Papers highlight the Arab regional </p><p>conference that was held in Riyadh yesterday, calling </p><p>for an end to the "occupation" of Iraq and rejecting </p><p>threats to Syria. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Free region of WMD" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (04/20) editorializes:  "The weapons </p><p>inspection saga is now a familiar story after the </p><p>international community saw where and how it led with </p><p>and ended in Iraq.  The UN weapons inspectors never </p><p>found a trace of any weapons of mass destruction in </p><p>Iraq and now after a month of US occupation, no proof </p><p>has been found to incriminate Iraq on that count. </p><p>Today, the same familiar tactics are being directed </p><p>towards Syria with suggestions that it should allow </p><p>weapons inspectors in to establish whether it has </p><p>chemical weapons or not..  Once inspectors are allowed </p><p>into the country, there is always a risk the United </p><p>States would never be satisfied with the findings and </p><p>may end up doing what it has done in Iraq, i.e. using </p><p>the pretext of its own unconfirmed allegations that </p><p>chemical weapons are present in Syria, to play havoc </p><p>with Syrian sovereignty..  Damascus now insists on a </p><p>UN Security Council resolution that would declare the </p><p>Middle East a zone free of all types of mass </p><p>destruction weapons, including of course nuclear </p><p>capability, which Israel holds claim to..  Double </p><p>standards in the application of the will of the </p><p>international community to rid the world of all mass </p><p>destruction weapons can no longer be accepted or </p><p>tolerated.  Now is the time to take up the Syrian </p><p>proposal if the United States and other interested </p><p>countries are serious about eliminating the dangers of </p><p>such weapons." </p><p> </p><p>-- "No Arab role" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Kawash writes on the back </p><p>page of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab </p><p>Al-Yawm (04/20):  "What happened in Iraq, and </p><p>previously in Palestine, makes us deal carefully with </p><p>the Arab position towards hot and serious issues. </p><p>Today, all Arab countries, without exception, reject </p><p>and condemn the U.S. threats against Syria..  When the </p><p>war begins, Damascus will realize that the brotherly </p><p>Arab countries are incapable of providing any </p><p>assistance, even helpless about issuing a statement of </p><p>condemnation against the United States..  We tell our </p><p>brothers in Syria to completely forget about any Arab </p><p>support or any joint Arab action in this new crisis </p><p>that the U.S. administration created.  We advise </p><p>Damascus to understand the changes, to read well the </p><p>U.S. developments and tendencies, and to quickly move </p><p>on the political and diplomatic front..  We have </p><p>washed our hands completely from any genuine Arab </p><p>action during crises and from any effective Arab role </p><p>in confronting the Israeli and the American onslaught, </p><p>and we say there is not Arab role.  Yet, this does not </p><p>mean that we should suffer from helpless, desperation </p><p>and frustration, because this time we are depending on </p><p>the role of the people in resisting the foreign </p><p>occupation.  The Palestinian people are still capable </p><p>of snatching their freedom and independence and the </p><p>Iraqi people are able to confront the occupation and </p><p>to protect its wealth." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Those gloating about the fall of Baghdad" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/20):  "Ousting the Baath regime in Iraq allowed </p><p>those who oppose that regime to cry over democracy and </p><p>to condemn oppression and dictatorship in an indirect </p><p>way of welcoming the American occupation of Iraq. </p><p>What is being written and said is not meant to serve </p><p>democracy, but to support the American stand and </p><p>justify the occupation of Iraq..  The freedom that </p><p>America brought is a freedom to steal, to loot, and to </p><p>destroy Iraq\'s treasures, history and heritage.. </p><p>Democracy cannot be imposed on people by the power of </p><p>steel, fire, Apaches and Tomahawks.  Democrats cannot </p><p>be led by Ahmad Jalabi, who embezzled millions of </p><p>dinars from the country that hosted him..  America </p><p>beat the Iraqi regime militarily, but the people of </p><p>Iraq are going to beat America politically.  While </p><p>America\'s military position was raised after the war, </p><p>its moral position and power collapsed..  What fell in </p><p>Iraq was not one of the Arab regimes.  It was the </p><p>strategic depth of Jordan and Syria; the high dam that </p><p>protected the Gulf countries from the Mullahs of Iran; </p><p>and the last obstacle in the face of eliminating the </p><p>Palestinian issue." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
