(C) Summary: Minutes from a short meeting between the </p><p>Japanese Ambassador and the Burmese Minister of National </p><p>Planning and Economic Development emphasize the new </p><p>pro-engagement policy outlined by the Japanese at the recent </p><p>ICG meeting in Tokyo.  The Ambassador\'s remarks give some </p><p>insight into Japan\'s vision of its policy in Burma, both </p><p>bilateral and as part of the larger Japan-ASEAN relationship. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Japan Stresses its Independence </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a meeting on February 21, the Japanese Ambassador </p><p>to Burma reiterated to the Minister of Economic Development </p><p>and National Planning, U Soe Tha, Japan\'s determination to </p><p>push ahead with a more ambitious policy of engagement with </p><p>Burma.  According to classified GOB minutes of this meeting, </p><p>the Japanese Ambassador also gave the Minister a short </p><p>readout of the Tokyo Informal Consultative Group (ICG) </p><p>meeting that took place on February 15 (described in Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The minutes record that the Ambassador reported the </p><p>ICG\'s conclusion that the United States, the United Kingdom, </p><p>and "western groups" have not been succesful in trying to </p><p>pressure Burma.  Instead, the international community should </p><p>try a new "way" of extending more assistance to Burma.  In </p><p>that spirit, the Ambassador told the Minister Japan will </p><p>provide more humanitarian assistance and advice on economic </p><p>reform and political development.  He added that Japan will </p><p>begin to take action regardless of what other nations decide </p><p>to do.  The Ambassador stressed that other countries and </p><p>international organizations are seeking their own ways to </p><p>start assisting Burma.  However, even if the international </p><p>community does not join in, Japan will carry out its </p><p>intentions -- even if the Japanese government has to </p><p>"confront challenges" to do so. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Japanese Ambassador, according to the minutes, </p><p>went on to say that Japan must consider its relations with </p><p>Burma in the larger context of Japan-ASEAN ties, and </p><p>strengthening the influence of ASEAN.  Somewhat more </p><p>cryptically, the minutes record the Japanese Ambassador </p><p>urging the Minister to ponder seriously the importance of </p><p>Burma\'s relations with India and the PRC. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Minister replied to the Ambassador quite </p><p>positively, complimenting him for his understanding of the </p><p>"true situation" in the country.  He urged the Ambassador to </p><p>work hard to ensure the Japanese government would soon carry </p><p>out the policy that had been outlined. </p><p> </p><p>Ties that Bind? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador\'s approach to the Minister dovetails </p><p>very well with the strong new position of engagement laid out </p><p>by the Japanese delegation at the ICG.  The only disconnect </p><p>between the two was the mention of using greater engagement </p><p>to encourage political dialogue; a theme Japan supported at </p><p>the ICG, but which the Ambassador apparently failed to </p><p>mention during his meeting with U Soe Tha.  The Ambassador\'s </p><p>assertion that Japan will act independently of other parties, </p><p>and his remarks on the importance of Japan\'s ties with ASEAN, </p><p>and thus Burma, might be interpreted as a reminder by the </p><p>Ambassador of Japan\'s importance as a regional power -- </p><p>competing as it is with the aggressive diplomacy in Burma of </p><p>China and India. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
