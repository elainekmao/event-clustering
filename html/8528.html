<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, PHUM, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FRG REACTS TO USG STATEMENT ABOUT RIOS MONTT </p><p>CANDIDACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Guatemala\'s anti-government dailies gave </p><p>prominent play to the Department\'s May 27 statement </p><p>expressing concern over the presidential candidacy of former </p><p>de facto president Efrain Rios Montt.  Zury Rios and other </p><p>prominent FRG contacts immediately weighed in with the </p><p>Ambassador and Embassy Officers to express their </p><p>disappointment with the U.S. position.  The opposition has </p><p>been privately pleased with the U.S. statement, though public </p><p>reaction has been limited. We do not know to what extent FRG </p><p>pique will affect the leadership they have taken in Congress </p><p>in promoting legislation of importance to us.  End summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher\'s May 27 </p><p>statement that "in light of Mr. Rios Montt\'s background, it </p><p>would be difficult to have a cordial relationship" with a </p><p>government headed by the former general, were he elected </p><p>President, played prominently in the Guatemalan press on May </p><p>28-29.  Rios Montt responded by telling reporters that he has </p><p>no doubt that the United States, as the foremost promoter of </p><p>democracy in the world, will uphold the choice of the </p><p>Guatemalan people in the upcoming election.  He added that he </p><p>does not understand why the United States could be worried </p><p>about him winning the election, as Americans are generally </p><p>firm believers in opinion polls, and the most recent voter </p><p>preference polls give him only three percent.  In response to </p><p>questions during a May 30 press roundtable in Guatemala City, </p><p>visiting Acting WHA Assistant Secretary Curt Struble </p><p>reiterated Spokesman Boucher\'s statement without elaboration. </p><p> President Portillo has not commented on the statement, and </p><p>Vice President Reyes limited himself to saying he had not yet </p><p>seen it. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Rios Montt\'s daughter and Second Vice President of </p><p>Congress Zury Rios called on the Ambassador on June 2 to </p><p>express her disappointment with the U.S. statement.  She </p><p>believes that the newest statement implies that relations </p><p>between the U.S. and a Rios Montt government would be </p><p>"unfriendly," which she views as significantly different from </p><p>the characterization of "awkward" that had been transmitted </p><p>to her privately by Deputy Assistant Secretary Dan Fisk in </p><p>November, 2002.  She was "shocked and taken aback" by the </p><p>"strong" USG statement, particularly in light of the FRG\'s </p><p>consistent and almost single-handed promotion of USG </p><p>interests in Congress during these past three years (e.g. </p><p>passage of legislation covering money laundering, IPR, labor </p><p>rights, asset forfeiture, maritime counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation, Mayan Jaguar counter-narcotics exercises, New </p><p>Horizons and more).  The Ambassador told her that the newest </p><p>public statement and earlier private statements were </p><p>essentially the same: that, given the history, there is a </p><p>political reality beyond our control that would make it </p><p>extremely difficult to have the kind of friendly relationship </p><p>with Guatemala that we would ideally prefer.  Zury Rios </p><p>closed by saying that if Rios Montt is elected to the </p><p>presidency in November, the U.S. will continue to get "far </p><p>better cooperation from the FRG on a full range of issues </p><p>than (the USG) would get from any of the other parties." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embassy officers have also received complaints from </p><p>Minister of Finance Eduardo Weymann and First Secretary of </p><p>Congress Haroldo Quej, who believe the USG position is </p><p>"unfair" and unbalanced by not mentioning USG concerns about </p><p>other candidates (including human rights concerns in the case </p><p>of URNG candidate Rodrigo Asturias, and corruption concerns </p><p>in the case of others).  Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez </p><p>told the Ambassador that the FRG bloc in Congress is very </p><p>upset ("muy molestos") with us. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Private sector leaders, in conversations with the </p><p>Ambassador and Embassy Officers on May 30 and June 2, were </p><p>elated at the USG statement, and believe that it was </p><p>important for the USG to weigh in at a time when Guatemalan </p><p>institutions are under pressure from the FRG to allow Rios </p><p>Montt to become a candidate in apparent violation of the </p><p>constitution.  Civil society leaders have also been </p><p>supportive, by and large, though nationalistic concerns may </p><p>have contributed to keeping their support for the statement </p><p>private for now. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Public reaction has been relatively muted.  Op ed </p><p>writers, who typically latch on to matters confronting the </p><p>USG with the government and the ruling FRG, have largely </p><p>resisted commenting on these latest statements.  One paper </p><p>gave prominent play to an interview with URNG Congressman </p><p>Ricardo Rosales who said it was "unacceptable" for a foreign </p><p>government to "interfere" with the electoral process in </p><p>Guatemala, arguing that it is up to Guatemalans to decide who </p><p>their next president will be. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: USG concerns over Rios Montt\'s presidential </p><p>ambitions have long been known by the FRG and its opponents. </p><p>Now that the United States view has been placed unambiguously </p><p>in the public spotlight, Guatemala\'s official institutions </p><p>that will ultimately have to decide on the constitutionality </p><p>of Rios Montt\'s candidacy will know that their decision will </p><p>face international scrutiny.  It is too soon to evaluate what </p><p>reaction Guatemalan voters will have to USG engagement on the </p><p>Rios Montt candidacy.  We do not know to what extent FRG </p><p>pique will impact on their helpfulness thus far in securing </p><p>votes in Congress on issues that are crucial to us (i.e. the </p><p>counter-narcotics maritime agreement, which has been driven </p><p>by Zury Rios), but we expect cooperation may well be impacted </p><p>in areas of legislation of secondary importance. </p><p>MCFARLAND </p><p></p></div>
