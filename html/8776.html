DART Field Team West witnessed the smooth start up of </p><p>the public distribution system in Al Hillah on 2 June with </p><p>numerous food trucks dropping off and picking up </p><p>commodities.  Public response to the mistaken release of a </p><p>notorious killer, linked to thousands of victims in the mass </p><p>graves of Babil, was diffused by the new Human Rights </p><p>Society of Babil that helped to persuade local residents to </p><p>remain calm.  The DART participated in the daily Governorate </p><p>Support Team meeting and learned that former Ba\'ath </p><p>government workers would have to renounce their affiliation </p><p>with the Party and turn in their Ba\'ath issued weapons </p><p>within 24 hours.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTION IN AL HILLAH </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Babil Governorate food and flour agents began the June </p><p>food distribution on 2 June following scheduled collections </p><p>of commodities from the main Al Hillah warehouse and grain </p><p>silo.  Coalition security forces were present at the </p><p>warehouse and assisted with the smooth movement of 36 short- </p><p>haul trucks entering and exiting the compound throughout the </p><p>morning and early afternoon.  Flour and rice collections </p><p>were also occurring without incident from the grain silo </p><p>warehouse, and Australian wheat grain was arriving and </p><p>discharging at the silo bins.  Final total numbers from the </p><p>silo will be available shortly.  All 1,713 Babil agents are </p><p>expected to arrive in Al Hillah to collect ration </p><p>commodities during the next 15 days. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Collections continued until approximately 15:00 even </p><p>though Ministry of Trade (MOT) employees normally worked </p><p>until early evening during pre-war distribution periods. </p><p>However, workers stated that due to the lack of authorized </p><p>overtime payments from MOT, they would only work normal </p><p>hours.  As previously reported by the DART, the MOT said the </p><p>normal overtime payment of 1,000 Iraqi dinars was paid to </p><p>those workers that stayed and worked on weekends, holidays, </p><p>and extra hours during distribution periods.  To date, this </p><p>1,000 dinar overtime payment has yet to be authorized. </p><p> </p><p>4.  U.N. World Food Program (WFP) national staff reported </p><p>that MOT/Baghdad has informed MOT Al Hillah that the </p><p>following exchanges would occur to assist Al Hillah in </p><p>covering shortages in certain food commodities: vegetable </p><p>Oil (800 metric tons (MT) from Basrah); detergent (100 MT </p><p>from Karbala); detergent (300 MT from An Najaf); and pulses </p><p>(280 MT from Al Anbar). </p><p> </p><p>5.  The MOT also instructed Al Hillah to ship 120 MT of </p><p>infant formula to Diyala Governorate.  Due to the double </p><p>rations provided by the former regime prior to the war, </p><p>beneficiaries have only two monthly coupons available for </p><p>the remainder of the year. These remaining coupons </p><p>correspond to the months of November and December.  Al </p><p>Hillah food agents have been instructed to accept one-half </p><p>of the November coupon for the complete June ration, and </p><p>next month, to accept the second half of the November coupon </p><p>for the complete July ration. They will repeat the same </p><p>procedure with the December coupon for August and September. </p><p> </p><p>6.  This strategy is designed to allow beneficiaries to </p><p>double value their remaining November and December coupons </p><p>to avoid running out of coupons after July. Therefore, the </p><p>November coupon will be valid for June and July; the </p><p>December coupon will be valid for August and September. </p><p>This should allow MOT additional days to print, properly </p><p>prepare, and distribute coupons for October, November, and </p><p>December, as well as for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>7.  As a result of the 2 June activities, several public </p><p>service announcements were prepared for broadcast on Al </p><p>Hillah television regarding the public distribution system </p><p>for June. The message will contain information to </p><p>beneficiaries and agents on the following issues: </p><p> </p><p>--  Confirm that the on-going distribution for full rations </p><p>has begun as planned; </p><p> </p><p>--  Provide food and flour agents with their schedules for </p><p>collection; </p><p> </p><p>--  Announce that, unlike the old system, agents need to </p><p>bring cash to collect their commodities; checks would not be </p><p>accepted by MOT; and </p><p> </p><p>--  Confirm that the June ration will be the same ration as </p><p>before the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PROTECTION ISSUES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Mohammed Jawad An-Neifus, who was suspected of </p><p>involvement in the murder of thousands of Iraqi Shiites in </p><p>and near Al Hillah, was released from the Bucca Internment </p><p>facility at Umm Qasr on 18 May.  According to a Coalition </p><p>statement, An-Neifus was detained by Coalition forces near </p><p>Al Hillah on 26 April and was turned over to Coalition </p><p>Military Police on 29 April.  An officer from the Judge </p><p>Advocate General\'s Corps conducted a routine screening of An- </p><p>Neifus on 18 May, and nothing he said alerted the officer to </p><p>his true identity.  The documents containing evidence of his </p><p>crimes did not arrive with him in Umm Qasr, so he was then </p><p>cleared for release.  Coalition forces have accepted sole </p><p>responsiblity for An-Neifus\' erroneous release and are </p><p>conducting a thorough investigation to ensure against </p><p>recurrences.  The Coalition is also offering a USD 25,000 </p><p>reward for information leading to his capture. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In conversations with the deputy of the Human Rights </p><p>Society as well as with local Iraqis, the community is </p><p>stunned at this revelation.  Many do not believe that this </p><p>release was accidental.  Some believe he used bribery in </p><p>order to buy his release.  There is a lot of frustration </p><p>among Iraqis in Al Hillah at this time; many question the </p><p>true aims of Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A joint statement was prepared by the Lawyers\' Union </p><p>and the Human Rights Society denouncing An-Neifus\' release </p><p>and putting sole responsibility for his recapture on </p><p>Coalition forces.  The deputy of the Human Rights Society </p><p>also said the community would like to try An-Neifus through </p><p>the Iraqi courts.  A silent demonstration was scheduled for </p><p>1 June; however, the Human Rights Society was able to halt </p><p>the demonstration because of fear of violence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>BABIL WEAPONS COLLECTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  All Babil government workers must sign one of two forms </p><p>denouncing affiliation with the Ba\'ath Party before </p><p>receiving their May salaries, a Civil Affairs officer </p><p>announced on 2 June at the Babil Governorate Support Team </p><p>(GST) meeting in which DART participated.  One form is for </p><p>those who never joined the Party; the other for those who </p><p>had.  Ex-Ba\'ath government workers who denounce affiliation </p><p>will be paid, but must forfeit their Ba\'ath-issued AK-47 </p><p>rifle or pistol within 24 hours.   Coalition forces will </p><p>search the houses of those who say they do not have a Ba\'ath </p><p>weapon.  Ex-Ba\'ath workers who do not denounce and sign the </p><p>document will not receive their salary and will be fired. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Fliers distributed in Al Hillah on 1 June declared a 14- </p><p>day amnesty period for people who own weapons.  Non- </p><p>Ba\'athists can keep their AK-47s and pistols, but must </p><p>register them.  Other weapons are forbidden and must be </p><p>turned over by the end of the amnesty period. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A GST Civil Affairs officer announced the formation of </p><p>a Babil "city council" to work with the governor.  The </p><p>governor\'s first attempt to create a city council dissolved </p><p>on 20 May when residents protested that initial appointments </p><p>had been stacked with the governor\'s allies.  The GST asked </p><p>the governor to develop a new city council plan while the </p><p>GST established a plan of its own.  On 4 June, they will </p><p>meet to merge the plans for a 20-to 30-member council with </p><p>elected officials.  There is no date set for a gubernatorial </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DART VISIT TO LOCAL AL HILLAH SCHOOL </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  Nearly 100 percent of 1,350 students have returned to </p><p>the primary school that the DART visited on 2 June on the </p><p>south side of Al Hillah.  The director said 36 windows were </p><p>broken from bomb reverberations during the war, and that </p><p>other problems existed, including poor water supply and </p><p>sanitation (five toilets), crowded classrooms, and no </p><p>ceiling fans for the hot months.  The director said the </p><p>facility was actually two schools in one: 630 girls attend </p><p>for three days straight, followed by 715 boys for the next </p><p>three days.  Classrooms hold between 50 and 55 students </p><p>each. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The director said this school was one of the best in </p><p>the area because high-level Ba\'ath Party members lived </p><p>nearby.  The deputy director said he remained at the school </p><p>during the war with other staff and neighbors to protect the </p><p>facility from looters.  There are 43 teachers, including 35 </p><p>women.  Passersby at the school entrance expressed anger at </p><p>DART for visiting a school that had received a modicum of </p><p>Ba\'ath largesse.  They asked DART to visit other nearby </p><p>schools that were in worse condition. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>AR RUTBAH SCHOOL OPEN DUE TO DART-FUNDED INTERVENTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  World Vision International (WVI) completed DART-funded </p><p>water and sanitation improvements at nine of 12 damaged and </p><p>looted Ar Rutbah schools, creating a groundswell of </p><p>enthusiasm to reopen the schools that had been destined to </p><p>remain closed until the next school year in September.  With </p><p>DART funds secured, WVI was able to obtain private donations </p><p>to fund additional repairs, such as replacing broken </p><p>windows, chalkboards, and doors, and painting walls.  WVI </p><p>said the rehabilitation provided a psychological boost to </p><p>the townspeople who have not only decided to restart </p><p>classes, but to extend the school year and hold final </p><p>exams.  The town was to forsake the entire year. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
