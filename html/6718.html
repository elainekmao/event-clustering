<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000585 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2009 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, YM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: YEMEN ANTSY OVER IRAQI CRITICISM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) An interpreter for President Salih, Mohamed Sudam, </p><p>phoned Ambassador March 23 to underline that the Yemeni </p><p>government is taking criticism over its stance on the war </p><p>against Iraq.  Sudam cited March 23 remarks of Iraqi VP Taha </p><p>Ramadan, and an editiorial by Al-Quds Al-Arabi\'s </p><p>editor-in-chief Abdul Bari.   (We have been unable to find </p><p>the latter, nor has the local stringer here for Al-Quds.) </p><p>Concurrent with Sudam\'s signal of Yemeni sensitivity, there </p><p>has been a shift in local media coverage (septel). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Here is the Ramadan excerpt -- in which Yemen clearly </p><p>falls in the third category: </p><p> </p><p>"As for the official Arab stands, they are divided into three </p><p>categories.  I know some Arab rulers will be annoyed by what </p><p>I say.  What I will say applies to the majority and not all </p><p>Arab states.  Here are the three categories.  1. Rulers who </p><p>directly plot and take part in the aggression, like the </p><p>regime in Kuwait.  2.  Rulers who plot and coordinate in </p><p>secret and indirectly or secretly take part in the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>aggression.  However, their role has started to be exposed. </p><p>The Arab masses started to discover their roles.  I will not </p><p>mention the names of those governments now.  3.  The failing </p><p>rulers who try to prevent their people from protesting the </p><p>aggression.  They ask their masses not to protest except with </p><p>the approval of interior ministers.  If the masses go the </p><p>embassies of aggression, they are confronted with bullets and </p><p>killing.  They convene councils of war and form investigation </p><p>committees and consider those who confront security men as </p><p>plotters against the security of their countries.  They </p><p>pledged to protect the Americans and Zionists in their </p><p>countries and they are ready to launch a war for this sake." </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
