(U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM JANET A. SANDERSON; REASONS: </p><p>1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE NOVEMBER 1997 BOYCOTT OF PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND ITS POLITICAL WING, </p><p>THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT, EXPOSED INTERNAL DIVISIONS WHICH </p><p>WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT\'S </p><p>POLICIES AND TACTICS.  THE ISLAMIST LEADERSHIP IS DIVIDED </p><p>INTO THREE COMPETING CAMPS, ALL WITH A DIFFERENT VISION OF </p><p>WHERE THE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE HEADED.  THE "MODERATES" </p><p>INCLUDE THE LEADERS OF BOTH THE IAF AND THE MB AND A HANDFUL </p><p>OF OTHERS WHO FAVOR CONTINUING THE MB\'S LONGSTANDING </p><p>ACCOMODATIONIST STRATEGY.  HOWEVER, THEY LACK A LARGE </p><p>FOLLOWING IN THE RANKS OF THE MB/IAF OR IN THE SHURA </p><p>COUNCILS.  RATHER, THEY ARE "COMPROMISE" LEADERS CHOSEN FOR </p><p>THEIR PROMINENCE AND PUBLIC RELATIONS SKILLS, BUT HAVE BEEN </p><p>INEFFECTIVE IN SHAPING OPINIONS WITHIN THE MOVEMENT.  A </p><p>SECOND FACTION, THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE THREE, IS A GROUP </p><p>OF "POLITICAL ACTIVISTS" WHO REPRESENT A YOUNG, WELL- </p><p>EDUCATED GENERATION OF MB MEMBERS SEEKING TO PROMOTE A MORE </p><p>AGGRESSIVE, ACTIVIST ROLE FOR THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT.  THIS </p><p>GROUP, LED BY A 41 YEAR OLD U.S.-EDUCATED ENGINEER NAMED </p><p>IMAD ABU DIYAH, ENJOYS A LARGE BLOCK OF SUPPORT IN THE SHURA </p><p>COUNCILS OF THE MB AND IAF, AND A BROAD BASE OF </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT IN THE MB RANK AND FILE.  WHILE THEIR </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS, WHICH EMPHASIZE DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>REFORMS, ANTI-NORMALIZATION, AND INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM </p><p>SOLIDARITY, DIFFER LITTLE FROM THE MODERATE LEADERSHIP, THEY </p><p>PUSH FOR A MORE CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AS A MEANS TO THAT END.  A THIRD FACTION, WHICH ALSO ENJOYS </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT IN THE SHURA COUNCILS AND AMONG THE RANK AND </p><p>FILE, ARE THE "RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES".  THIS GROUP HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION OF WORKING WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON ANY TERMS.  THEY WOULD HAVE THE MB FOCUS MORE </p><p>NARROWLY ON AN AGENDA OF SHARIA LAW REFORMS, RELIGIOUS </p><p>EDUCATION, AND SPIRITUAL MATTERS.  THEY ARE MORE STRICTLY </p><p>REJECTIONIST IN FOREIGN POLICY MATTERS THAN THE OTHER TWO </p><p>GROUPS AS WELL.  CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING A YOUNGER </p><p>AND MORE ETHNICALLY PALESTINIAN MEMBERSHIP, ARE IN PART </p><p>BEHIND THE SHIFTING AGENDAS WITHIN THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT.  A </p><p>NUMBER OF THE MODERATES AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS HAVE </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT A RISING TIDE OF EXTREMISM WITHIN </p><p>THE MB RANK AND FILE, WHICH THEY FEEL WILL BE EXACERBATED BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THIS IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF REPORTS EXAMINING </p><p>THE STATE OF ISLAMIST POLITICS IN JORDAN.  REF A CONSIDERED </p><p>THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH OF THE MOVEMENT. </p><p>REF B LOOKED AT THE CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE </p><p>ISLAMISTS AND THE GOVERNMENT.  WHILE OTHER ISLAMIST </p><p>MOVEMENTS EXIST IN JORDAN, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, INCLUDING </p><p>ITS POLITICAL ARM, THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT PARTY, SO </p><p>DOMINATES ISLAMIST POLITICS IN JORDAN THAT "ISLAMIST" AND </p><p>"MB" WILL BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY.  THE INFORMATION IN THESE </p><p>REPORTS WAS COLLECTED FROM MEETINGS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS WITH MB AND IAF LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE ISLAMIST </p><p>POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AS WELL AS CONTACTS FORM ACADEMIA, </p><p>JOURNALISM, AND THE GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY AND </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>BOYCOTT HIGHLIGHTS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE NOVEMBER 1997 BOYCOTT OF PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND ITS POLITICAL WING </p><p>THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT (IAF) EXPOSED DIVISIONS WHICH WILL </p><p>HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT\'S POLICIES </p><p>AND TACTICS.  HOWEVER, WHILE THE MEDIA AND SOME ANALYSTS </p><p>TROTTED OUT SHOPWORN CLICHES REGARDING "HAWKS" AND "DOVES" </p><p>IN THE MB RANKS, THE REAL DIVISIONS ARE MORE COMPLEX, AND </p><p>WERE ONLY PARTIALLY CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION OF </p><p>BOYCOTTING ELECTIONS.  IN FACT, THE ISLAMIST LEADERSHIP IS </p><p>DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPETING CAMPS, ALL WITH DIFFERENT </p><p>VISIONS OF WHERE THE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE HEADED.  THE </p><p>CONFLICTING VISIONS ARE NOT NEW, AND IN FACT HAVE BEEN </p><p>PRESENT IN VARIOUS FORMS SINCE THE MB\'S ESTABLISHMENT IN </p><p>JORDAN IN THE 1940\'S.  HOWEVER, THE WADI ARABA PEACE TREATY </p><p>WITH ISRAEL, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FOR MANY </p><p>JORDANIANS, AND STALLED PROGRESS ON JORDANIAN </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION HAVE COME TOGETHER MAKE THE DIVIDING LINES </p><p>BRIGHTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BRIEFLY, THE THREE MAJOR DIVISIONS WITHIN THE MB </p><p>TODAY ARE:  FIRST, A SMALL GROUP OF MODERATE LEADERS WHO </p><p>HOLD TOP LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND SEEK TO CONTINUE A LOW- </p><p>KEY, NON-CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TOWARD WORKING WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ("MODERATES"); SECOND, A GROUP OF YOUNG MB </p><p>LEADERS, WELL-REPRESENTED IN THE SHURA AND EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCILS, WHO SEEK A MORE CONFRONTATIONAL, ACTIVIST APPROACH </p><p>TO THE GOJ, ESPECIALLY ON KEY ISSUES SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION </p><p>AND THE PEACE PROCESS ("POLTICAL ACTIVISTS"); AND THIRD, A </p><p>GROUP OF RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES WHO SEEK STRONGER EMPHASIS </p><p>ON SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ISSUES AND HAVE EMERGED OVER THE LAST </p><p>FIVE YEARS AS A POWERFUL POLITICAL FACTION WITHIN THE PARTY </p><p>("RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES").  A MORE DETAILED EXAMINATION OF </p><p>THESE DIVISIONS FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE MODERATE LEADERSHIP:  HOLDING A TIGER BY THE TAIL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE MOST VISIBLE GROUPING WITHIN THE ISLAMIST </p><p>MOVEMENT CONSISTS OF MANY OF THE TOP MB/IAF LEADERS, </p><p>INCLUDING MB CONTROLLER GENERAL ABDEL MAJEED THUNAYBAT, IAF </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL ABDEL LATIF ARRABIYAT, AND IAF SHURA </p><p>COUNCIL CHIEF ISHAQ FARHAN.  THESE MEN AND A HANDFUL OF </p><p>OTHERS HAVE HELD TOP POSITIONS IN THE MOVEMENT FOR THE PAST </p><p>DECADE, AND SEEK TO CONTINUE THE MB\'S LONGSTANDING </p><p>ACCOMODATIONIST POLICY TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT.  WORKING FROM </p><p>AN ASSUMPTION OF LOYALTY TO THE HASHEMITE REGIME, ALL HAVE </p><p>LONG HISTORIES OF ADVOCATING AND PRACTICING COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, FARHAN WAS FOR A TIME IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1970\'S EXPELLED FROM THE MB FOR AGREEING TO SERVE AS </p><p>EDUCATION MINISTER.  THEY ARE CAPABLE LEADERS, INTELLIGENT, </p><p>AND WELL-RESPECTED.  FARHAN AND ARRABIYAT HOLD DOCTORATES </p><p>FROM U.S. UNIVERSITIES.  THEY CAME TO PROMINENCE IN 1989 AS </p><p>JORDAN MOVED TO OPEN ITS POLITICAL PROCESS, AND THE MB FOUND </p><p>ITSELF LACKING IN EXPERIENCED LEADERSHIP READY TO TAKE ON A </p><p>MORE PUBLIC ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE STRENGTH OF THESE LEADERS - THAT THEY WERE </p><p>CHOSEN ON MERIT WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR THEIR PERSONAL </p><p>POLITICAL FOLLOWINGS - IS ALSO A WEAKNESS.  FARHAN, </p><p>ARRABIYAT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THUNAYBAT, LACK A STRONG </p><p>POLITICAL BASE WITHIN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  MORE </p><p>PARTICULARLY, THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZERS </p><p>AND THEREFORE LACK THE STRONG CONNECTIONS TO THE RANK AND </p><p>FILE ENJOYED BY THEIR IDEOLOGICAL COMPETITORS WITHIN THE </p><p>MOVEMENT.  THE MB HAS, SINCE THE LATE 70\'S, ABSORBED A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF NEW MEMBERS WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIST MOVEMENT TODAY.  THIS YOUNGER GENERATION IS FAR </p><p>MORE INCLINED TO ALLY ITSELF TO THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE </p><p>OR POLITICAL ACTIVIST LEADERS WHO RECRUITED IT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE MODERATES WAS MADE </p><p>CLEAR WHEN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BOYCOTT DECISION WAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED LAST SUMMER.  FARHAN, ARRABIYAT, AND THUNAYBAT ALL </p><p>THREATENED TO RESIGN IN PROTEST IF THE ISLAMISTS VOTED TO </p><p>BOYCOTT OVER THEIR STRONG AND PUBLICLY EXPRESSED OBJECTIONS. </p><p>WHEN THE PRO-BOYCOTT MEASURE PASSED EASILY (MB SOURCES SAY </p><p>ABOUT 85 PERCENT VOTED IN FAVOR IN BOTH THE MB AND IAF SHURA </p><p>COUNCILS), ALL WERE FORCED TO RETRACT THEIR RESIGNATIONS AND </p><p>HEW TO THE PARTY LINE.  OTHER MODERATES, SUCH AS </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTIES ABDULLAH AKAILEH AND BASSAM EMMOUSH, </p><p>WHO PUBLICLY REPUDIATED THE BOYCOTT DECISION, WERE EXPELLED </p><p>FROM THE MB AND SUSPENDED FROM THE IAF.  THUS, THE COMBINED </p><p>MB/IAF LEADERSHIP AND SEVERAL OF THE MOST PROMINENT </p><p>ISLAMISTS IN JORDAN HAD NO VISIBLE EFFECT ON THE ISLAMIST </p><p>BOYCOTT DECISION.  EVEN THE GOJ MAY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY </p><p>THE POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE MODERATE LEADERSHIP.  AS AN MB </p><p>JOURNALIST (AND MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL ACTIVIST CAMP) </p><p>EXPLAINED:  "THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE MB. </p><p>THEY SAW ONLY THE EXTREME RIGHT (RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES) </p><p>AND THE EXTREME LEFT (MODERATE LEADERSHIP).  THEY WOULD ONLY </p><p>TALK TO FARHAN, AKAILEH, AND EMMOUSH (WELL-KNOWN MODERATES). </p><p>THEY NEVER REALIZED THAT A THIRD FORCE (POLITICAL ACTIVISTS) </p><p>WAS READY TO TAKE POWER." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS:  A NEW GENERATION PREPARES FOR </p><p>POWER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  AT STREET LEVEL, AND IN THE SHURA COUNCILS, A GROUP </p><p>OF POLITICAL ACTIVISTS IMPATIENT WITH THE ACCOMODATIONIST </p><p>APPROACH OF THE MODERATE LEADERSHIP HAS EMERGED AS THE MOST </p><p>POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE POLITICAL FORCE WITHIN THE MB.  THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THIS GROUP WERE GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZERS OF THE </p><p>1980\'S AND 90\'S, WHO RECRUITED AND INDOCTRINATED THE NEW </p><p>GENERATION OF MB MEMBERS WHICH NOW MAKES UP A NUMERICAL </p><p>MAJORITY OF THE PARTY, ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES.  IMAD ABU </p><p>DIYAH, A CHARISMATIC 41 YEAR-OLD U.S.-EDUCATED COMPUTER </p><p>PROGRAMMER AND MEMBER OF THE MB EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, HAS </p><p>EMERGED AS THE LEADER OF THIS GROUP, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES MB </p><p>SPOKESMAN JAMIL ABU BAKER, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER SALIM </p><p>FALAHAT, AND OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ABU DIYAH WAS THE POLITICAL FORCE </p><p>BEHIND THE ELECTION BOYCOTT LAST YEAR, A CONTEST WHERE HE </p><p>WENT HEAD TO HEAD WITH MB LEADER THUNAYBAT.  HIS SUPPORTERS </p><p>SPEAK OF HIM IN HIGHLY DEFERENTIAL AND ADMIRING TERMS.  THE </p><p>EDITOR OF MB NEWSPAPER AL-SABEEL, SAUD ABU MAHFOUZ (PLEASE </p><p>PROTECT), TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY:  "HAMMAM SAEED (LEADER OF </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN THE MB) IS MY SHAYKH, BUT </p><p>IMAD ABU DIYAH IS MY LEADER."  ABU MAHFOUZ, 10 YEARS OLDER </p><p>THAN ABU DIYAH AND A MEMBER OF THE IAF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, </p><p>IS REPRESENTATIVE OF A NUMBER OF SENIOR MB POLITICAL AND </p><p>INTELLECTUAL LEADERS WHO SPEAK OF ABU DIYAH IN THE SAME </p><p>MANNER.  A MEMBER OF THE MB POLICY PLANNING COMMITTEE TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT ABU DIYAH "HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MB\'S BEST GRASS </p><p>ROOTS ORGANIZERS - HE HAS AN ENORMOUS FOLLOWING ON THE MB </p><p>STREET."    EVEN HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES ACKNOWLEDGE HIS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS AS A POLITICIAN.  FORMER IAF DEPUTY BASSAM </p><p>EMMOUSH (PLEASE PROTECT), WHO WAS EJECTED FROM THE MB FOR </p><p>HIS PUBLIC REJECTION OF THE ELECTION BOYCOTT (AND WAS </p><p>REWARDED BY THE GOJ BY BEING NAMED MINISTER FOR </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT), RECENTLY TOLD POLOFF THAT ABU </p><p>DIYAH IS A "DANGEROUS" LEADER WHO "WILL LEAD THE BROTHERHOOD </p><p>TO PRISON." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  POLOFF MET WITH ABU DIYAH AT MB HEADQUARTERS </p><p>RECENTLY.  A 1984 GRADUATE OF UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN (MS - </p><p>COMPUTER SCIENCE), ABU DIYAH SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.  IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO OTHER MB AND IAF LEADERS, WHO CITED THE JUNE, </p><p>1997 PRESS AND PUBLICATIONS LAW AMENDMENTS AND JORDAN\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW AS THE IMMEDIATE REASONS FOR THE BOYCOTT, ABU </p><p>DIYAH CITED "JORDANIAN FOREIGN POLICIES" (READ THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS) AS THE FIRST REASON FOR THE BOYCOTT, ONLY FOLLOWED </p><p>BY THE LACK OF MEANINGFUL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION FOR THE </p><p>LEGISLATURE.  IMPLICITLY CRITICIZING MB LEADERS WHO HAVE </p><p>ARGUED THAT CONFRONTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT WILL LEAD TO A </p><p>HARSH GOJ RESPONSE, ABU DIYAH SAID:  "THE JORDANIAN PEOPLE </p><p>ARE ANGRY, HUNGRY, AND SUFFERING GREATLY.  IT\'S TIME WE </p><p>BEGAN REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE RATHER THAN </p><p>OURSELVES." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  SUPPORTERS OF ABU DIYAH SAY THAT HIS PRIMARY </p><p>POLITICAL GOAL IS TO PUSH FOR A MORE OPEN POLITICAL SYSTEM </p><p>WHERE THE MB WILL HAVE A OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN POLICY-MAKING.  IN PURSUIT OF THIS GOAL, HE </p><p>IS WILLING TO USE CONFRONTATIONAL (BUT NOT VIOLENT) </p><p>TACTICS - SUCH AS BOYCOTTS, DEMONSTRATIONS, AND STRIKES - </p><p>WHICH HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN AVOIDED BY ISLAMISTS IN </p><p>JORDAN.  IT IS THIS ISSUE OF STRATEGY WHICH DIVIDES ABU </p><p>DIYAH AND HIS SUPPORTERQE MODERATE LEADERSHIP.  THE </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVISTS ARE PROFOUNDLY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE </p><p>EFFICACY OF WORKING WITH THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT (REF B). </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY LOOK FOR WAYS TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR POPULAR </p><p>STRENGTH AND AFFECT CHANGE THROUGH DIRECT GRASS ROOTS </p><p>ORGANIZING, A PROGRAM THEY REFER TO AS "BEYOND POLITICS." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  IN FACT, THE SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVISTS DIFFERS LITTLE FROM THAT OF THE MODERATE </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  BOTH ESPOUSE A VAGUE PAN-ARAB/ISLAMIC </p><p>SOLIDARITY, AN END TO NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL, AND REFORMS </p><p>TO ADDRESS JORDAN\'S POVERTY, INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH, AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION.  HOWEVER, ABU DIYAH IS MORE OUTSPOKEN </p><p>IN HIS WILLINGNESS TO CALL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WHICH </p><p>WILL OBVIOUSLY AFFECT THE HASHEMITE REGIME\'S MONOPOLY ON </p><p>POWER.  EVEN ON THE LIGHTNING ROD ISSUE OF THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, ABU DIYAH, IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, DISPLAYED </p><p>SURPRISING FLEXIBILITY.  WHEN POLOFF ASKED ABU DIYAH WHETHER </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN JORDAN COULD LIVE WITH THE STATE </p><p>OF ISRAEL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ABU DIYAH REPLIED "IF WE </p><p>CAN FIND A FORMULA WHICH WOULD SATISFY THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASPIRATIONS AND PERSONAL AMBITIONS OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PEOPLE, WE WILL HAVE ATTAINED OUR GOAL." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES:  A NEW ASSERTIVENESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  A THIRD FACTION WHICH COMMANDS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INFLUENCE WITHIN THE MB TODAY ARE THE "RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVES."  THESE ARE A GROUP OF RELIGIOUSLY-ORIENTED </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO FOCUS ON A TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC SOCIAL </p><p>AND SPIRITUAL MESSAGE.  THEY ARE LED BY A 54 YEAR OLD AL- </p><p>AZHAR-EDUCATED SHAYKH NAMED HAMMAM SAEED.  THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVES, AS PART OF A COMPROMISE WITH IAF MODERATES </p><p>DIRECTED AGAINST ABU DIYAH\'S MORE POWERFUL POLITICAL </p><p>CONSERVATIVE FACTION, RECENTLY ENGINEERED SAEED\'S ELECTION </p><p>AS DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE IAF.  SAEED, MB EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER MOHAMMED ABU FARES, AND SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>LEADERS OF THIS GROUP CONTROL, ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES, </p><p>ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE MB AND IAF SHURA COUNCILS.  THEY </p><p>HAVE A STRONG AND PARTICULARLY LOYAL BASE IN THE MB RANK AND </p><p>FILE, WHERE, LIKE ABU DIYAH AND HIS SUPPORTERS, THEY HAVE </p><p>BEEN ACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL RECRUITERS AND ORGANIZERS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN </p><p>THE MB.  UNLIKE THE MODERATES OR THE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS, </p><p>THEY FOCUS THEIR MESSAGE ON SOCIAL ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA LAWS, SEGREGATION OF THE SEXES, AND </p><p>THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE.  TRADITIONALLY, </p><p>THEY HAVE BEEN LESS INTERESTED IN DIRECT POLITICAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION THAN OTHERS IN THE MB, BELIEVING THAT WORKING </p><p>WITH WHAT THEY DEEM AN ILLEGITIMATE (I.E. NON-ISLAMIC) </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD INEVITABLY CORRUPT THE MOVEMENT.  FOR THIS </p><p>REASON THEY HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY WEAK IN THE IAF.  HOWEVER, </p><p>MOST MB OBSERVERS SEE THESE ATTITUDES CHANGING UNDER THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF THE AMBITIOUS SAEED. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES HAVE EMERGED OVER THE </p><p>PAST FIVE YEARS AS THE FASTEST GROWING FACTION WITHIN THE </p><p>MB.  ACCORDING TO A MEMBER OF THE MB POLICY PLANNING </p><p>COMMITTEE, THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES "SURPRISED EVERYBODY" </p><p>WITH A POWERFUL SHOWING IN THE 1994 SECTION (LOCAL CHAPTERS) </p><p>AND SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS, AND HAVE BEEN ON THE ASCENDENT </p><p>SINCE THEN.  THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF AN ACTIVE RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVE BLOC UNDER SAEED WORRY EVEN THE POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVISTS, SEVERAL OF WHOM REFERRED TO SAEED AS AN </p><p>"EXTREMIST."  INDEED, SAEED AND HIS SUPPORTERS, IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THEIR CALL FOR STRICTER APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC LAW (WHICH </p><p>MANY MB LEADERS SEE AS A COUNTERPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY FOR THE </p><p>ISLAMISTS), TAKE HIGHLY UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONS ON SUCH </p><p>THINGS AS THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL, </p><p>IRAQ SANCTIONS, AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT OR OTHER FOREIGN </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE JORDANIAN ECONOMY.  THOUGH SAEED IS CAREFUL </p><p>IN PUBLIC, MANY IN HIS FACTION GO SO FAR AS TO QUESTION THE </p><p>(ISLAMIC) LEGITIMACY OF THE HASHEMITE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>"YOUTH AND ETHNICITY" BEHIND CHANGING ATTITUDES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  THE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVES TOGETHER PROBABLY ACCOUNT FOR AT LEAST 80 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE MB MEMBERSHIP.  MB SOURCES ATTRIBUTE THEIR </p><p>STRENGTH TO DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>ALTERED THE MB\'S MEMBERSHIP PROFILE SINCE THE LATE </p><p>SEVENTIES.   ONCE DOMINATED BY RURAL AND PROVINCIAL EAST </p><p>BANKERS, THE MB NOW HAS A NEAR EVENLY-DIVIDED </p><p>PALESTINIAN/EAST BANK MEMBERSHIP WITH A MAJORITY OF ITS </p><p>MEMBERS UNDER 40.   THE YOUNGER MEMBERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO </p><p>HAVE ESTABLISHED TRIBAL TIES OR OTHER VESTED INTERESTS WHICH </p><p>THE GOJ CAN MANIPULATE.  THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WELL- </p><p>EDUCATED AND UNDEREMPLOYED.  THOUGH THEY ARE PARTICULARLY </p><p>WELL REPRESENTED IN THE ABU DIYAH\'S POLITICAL ACTIVIST WING, </p><p>THEY ALSO HAVE A STRONG PRESENCE IN AMONG THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVES.  MB LEADER ABDEL MAJEED THUNAYBAT TOLD POLOFF </p><p>IN A RECENT CONVERSATION THAT "YOUTH AND ETHNICITY (I.E. </p><p>PALESTINIANS)" ARE BEHIND THE MB\'S MORE CONFRONTATIONAL </p><p>APPROACH IN GENERAL AND THE BOYCOTT IN PARTICULAR - A VIEW </p><p>ECHOED BY EVERY MB CONTACT CONSULTED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FEARS OF RISING EXTREMISM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (S)  SEVERAL ISLAMIST LEADERS EXPRESSED TO POLOFF THEIR </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT A RISING TIDE OF EXTREMIST SENTIMENT AMONG THE </p><p>MB RANK AND FILE.  THEY FEEL THAT CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED </p><p>GOJ MEASURES TO SUPPRESS THE MB WILL WEAKEN THEIR ABILITY TO </p><p>CONTROL EXTREMIST ELEMENTS WITHIN THE MOVEMENT.  MB </p><p>CONTROLLER GENERAL THUNAYBAT (PLEASE PROTECT), TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT "I WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR MOVEMENT - THE MB WILL </p><p>NOT TAKE UP MILITARY ACTIVITY.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT CAN </p><p>ONLY PRESS US SO FAR.  THERE IS A VERY REAL DANGER THAT </p><p>UNDER PRESSURE, GROUPS WILL ARISE OUT OF THE MB RANKS WHO DO </p><p>CHOOSE THE PATH OF VIOLENCE."  IAF LEADER ABDEL LATIF </p><p>ARRABIYAT (PLEASE PROTECT), A WELL-SPOKEN, THOUGHTFUL </p><p>MODERATE TOLD POLOFF THAT "WITHIN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>NOW, WE ARE NOT SEEING EXTREMIST VIEWS OF THE KIND THAT </p><p>PRODUCED THE ATROCITIES IN LUXOR OR ALGERIA - WE ARE NOT AT </p><p>THAT POINT.  HOWEVER, I DO FEAR THAT SOMETHING OF THE SORT </p><p>COULD ARISE."  ARRABIYAT THEN DESCRIBED HOW AT A RECENT </p><p>PARTY MEETING A YOUNG MB DELEGATE DEMANDED THAT HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER WAS A "KAFFIR" </p><p>(INFIDEL).  WHEN ARRABIYAT REFUSED, HIS QUESTIONER LOOKED </p><p>THE DISTINGUISHED 68 YEAR OLD PARTY LEADER IN THE EYE AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED "THEN YOU ARE A KAFFIR YOURSELF."  ARRABIYAT SHOOK </p><p>HIS HEAD IN DISMAY AS HE RELATED THE STORY. (NOTE: </p><p>DENOUNCING ARAB LEADERS AS INFIDELS IS THE HALLMARK OF </p><p>EXTREMIST MB OFFSHOOTS.) </p><p> </p><p>19.  (S)  BOTH ARRABIYAT AND FORMER MB DEPUTY (NOW MINISTER </p><p>FOR ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT) BASSAM EMMOUSH (PROTECT), IN </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH POLOFF, APPEALED TO THE USG TO COUNSEL </p><p>THE GOJ THAT THEIR UNCOMPROMISING POLICIES TOWARD THE MB ARE </p><p>MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE MB TO COMBAT EXTREMISM </p><p>WITHIN ITS RANKS.  EMMOUSH SAID "CLINTON CAME TO SHARM AL- </p><p>SHEIK AND TOLD ARAB GOVERNMENTS THAT THE WAY TO FIGHT </p><p>EXTREMISM IS MORE JAILS, MORE POLICE.  THIS IS WRONG.  TO </p><p>FIGHT EXTREMISTS WITHIN A POPULAR MOVEMENT LIKE THE </p><p>ISLAMISTS, YOU MUST SUPPORT THE MODERATES.  WHEN YOU PUNISH </p><p>THE MODERATES, YOU END UP WITH SITUATIONS LIKE ALGERIA AND </p><p>EGYPT.  WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT PROBLEM UNTIL NOW.  THE KING </p><p>CAN STILL WALK DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING </p><p>ASSASSINATED.  BUT THAT WILL CHANGE - WE ARE HEADING IN THAT </p><p>DIRECTION." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (S)  THE FUTURE OF THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IN JORDAN IS </p><p>WITH IMAD ABU DIYAH\'S POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND HAMMAM SAEED\'S </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES.  IN SOME COMBINATION, THEY WILL </p><p>SEEK OUT A MORE CONFRONTATIONAL, ACTIVIST APPROACH TOWARD </p><p>THE GOJ ON MANY ISSUES.  HAVING DEMONSTRATED THE CAPACITY TO </p><p>MAINTAIN A UNITED PUBLIC FRONT THROUGH DIFFICULT INTERNAL </p><p>DEBATES, THE DIVISIONS THEY REPRESENT SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>OVEREMPHASIZED.  RATHER, THEIR GROWING CONFIDENCE WILL DRIVE </p><p>THEM TO PUSH THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENDAS ON THE MODERATE </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THEY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE THE POLITICAL </p><p>STATEMENTS OF THE MB AND IAF MORE FORCEFUL AND DIRECT.  IT </p><p>REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE GOJ WILL LOOK FOR CREATIVE </p><p>WAYS TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING ISLAMIST POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. </p><p>FOR NOW, THE GOJ\'S INSTINCTS SEEM TO BE TO PUSH BACK HARD. </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, IT IS WORRISOME THAT THE GOJ\'S TOUGH </p><p>APPROACH TO THE MB OF LATE IS SEEN BY ITS MODERATE LEADERS </p><p>AS UNDERMINING THEIR ABILITY TO CONTROL EXTREMIST ELEMENTS </p><p>IN THE RANK AND FILE. </p><p> </p><p>EGAN </p><p></p></div>
