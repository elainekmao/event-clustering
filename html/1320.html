IRVING. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON OCTOBER 20, CHARGE MET DEPUTY HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER RUGARE GUMBO, IN THE ABSENCE OF MINISTER JOHN </p><p>NKOMO, TO REGISTER U.S. CONCERN OVER THIS WEEK\'S UNREST </p><p>AND THE GOZ\'S RESPONSE.  CHARGE MADE THE POINTS THAT WE </p><p>BELIEVE THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP) RESPONDED </p><p>WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE, AND THAT TWO OF OUR FSN EMPLOYEES </p><p>WERE DIRECTLY AFFECTED, INCLUDING ONE BEING SEVERELY </p><p>BEATEN.  ALTHOUGH WE ACCEPT THAT THE GOZ HAS THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER, </p><p>INDISCRIMINATE, DOOR-TO-DOOR BEATINGS HAVE NO PLACE IN A </p><p>MULTIPARTY DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) GUMBO RESPONDED THAT HE WILL CONVEY OUR CONCERN </p><p>TO HIS SUPERIORS.  HE SAID THAT HE APPRECIATES THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY THE USG MUST HAVE IN ASSESSING THE SITUATION </p><p>FROM SO FAR AWAY.  THE GOZ IS HERE TO GOVERN, AND HAS </p><p>BEEN GIVEN A MANDATE FROM THE PEOPLE TO DO SO.  THE GOZ </p><p>HAS EXERCISED ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT LIFE AND </p><p>PROPERTY, AND IT WILL NOT TAKE CHANCES WHEN THERE ARE </p><p>"CRIMINAL TENDENCIES" IN A SOCIETY BESET BY ECONOMIC </p><p>HARDSHIP, GUMBO EXPLAINED.  THE ARMY WAS BROUGHT IN TO </p><p>ASSIST THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY WERE OVERSTRETCHED AND </p><p>COULD NOT HANDLE THE SITUATION ALONE.  GUMBO ACTED </p><p>DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DID NOT COMMEND THE GOZ ON </p><p>PREVENTING THE LOSS OF LIFE WHEN IT IS SUCH A PROBLEM IN </p><p>OTHER AREAS LIKE NIGERIA.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER CLAIMED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05943  201157Z </p><p>TO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE MDC ENGINEERED THE UNREST TO </p><p>TRY TO FORCE MUGABE FROM POWER.  "HOW CAN WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THEIR DEMOCRATIC INTENTIONS ARE GENUINE WHEN THEIR </p><p>LEADER ESPOUSES VIOLENCE?" HE ASKED.  GUMBO ALSO ACTED </p><p>HURT THAT THE USG WOULD ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE THROUGH THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT.  "HOW DO </p><p>YOU THINK WE FEEL WHEN THE USG DOES THIS WHILE FUNDING </p><p>THE OPPOSITION?"  WE BELIEVE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS </p><p>AND WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE USG MAKES </p><p>IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO SO, GUMBO PROFESSED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE CHARGE REPLIED THAT THE ZDA IS DEAD AND THAT </p><p>IT IS SOMETHING TO PUT BEHIND US.  IN TERMS OF THE ARMY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN QUELLING THE UNREST, WE WORRY THAT IT </p><p>COULD BE A HARBINGER OF MORE UNREST OR MARTIAL LAW. </p><p>GUMBO ASSURED THE CHARGE THAT THE SITUATION IS STABLE, </p><p>DESPITE THE MDC\'S ATTEMPTS TO MAKE IT WORSE.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER SAID THE MDC WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISTURBANCES </p><p>BREAKING OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK IN THE RATCLIFFE TOWNSHIP </p><p>OF KWEKWE, SOME 200 KM DISTANT FROM HARARE.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WE HAVE SEEN NO OTHER CREDIBLE REPORTS OF UNREST IN </p><p>URBAN CENTERS OUTSIDE HARARE.  END COMMENT.)  IN ANY </p><p>CASE, "THE MDC HAS LEARNED ITS LESSON," GUMBO CONTINUED. </p><p>HE TAKES OUR CONCERNS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES </p><p>SERIOUSLY AND WILL NOTIFY US IF THERE ARE ANY SIGNS OF </p><p>NEW TROUBLE.  GUMBO EVEN OFFERED TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>INCIDENTS WHERE OUR FSN AND ANOTHER\'S FAMILY WERE BEATEN </p><p>BY THE POLICE (REFS B AND C).  HE SAID HIS MINISTRY HAS </p><p>NOT YET FULLY INVESTIGATED THE REPORTS OF POLICE </p><p>VIOLENCE, BUT IT WILL CONDUCT A POST MORTEM ON THE </p><p>EVENTS OF THIS WEEK. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05943  201157Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: GUMBO\'S SOMEWHAT ACCUSATORY MANNER IS </p><p>NOT ALTOGETHER SUPRISING GIVEN HIS REPUTATION FOR </p><p>RUTHLESSNESS.  HIS MBERENGWA EAST DISTRICT SAW SOME OF </p><p>THE WORST POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION PRIOR TO </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  NONETHELESS, THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER APPEARED TO TAKE OUR CONCERNS ON BOARD </p><p>AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REPORT THEM TO MINISTER NKOMO.  HIS </p><p>STEADFAST BELIEF THAT THE MDC WAS BEHIND THE UNREST IS </p><p>WORRISOME AND COULD INDICATE THAT HE HAD A HAND IN </p><p>ORDERING THE DOOR-TO-DOOR BEATINGS.  IT COULD ALSO </p><p>PRESAGE A MORE INTENSE CRACKDOWN ON THE MDC SHOULD THE </p><p>OPPOSITION RESORT TO MASS ACTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
