<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IAF URGES CITIZENS NOT TO COOPERATE WITH US TROOPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>IAF SUPPORTS BOYCOTT AGAINST US TROOPS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Islamic Action Front (IAF) issued a </p><p>statement--published in the Muslim Brotherhood mouthpiece </p><p>Al-Sabil on March 4--urging Jordanians to boycott US </p><p>soldiers.    The statement called on Jordanians to refuse </p><p>leasing land, housing, or cars, and not to provide US </p><p>soldiers with food or services.  "Following the government\'s </p><p>explicit announcement on the presence of hundreds of US </p><p>soldiers in the country...it has become necessary not to </p><p>offer any services to those soldiers since they are part of </p><p>the US-British buildup, which announces day and night its </p><p>intention to invade Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LOW LEVEL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) An unnamed source from the government responded </p><p>quickly in several newspapers that the GOJ disapproved of the </p><p>IAF statement and emphasized that the US troops in Jordan </p><p>were there only to train Jordanian forces on operating the </p><p>Patriot missile batteries, not to participate in any Iraqi </p><p>conflict.  Hamza Mansour, Secretary General of the IAF, </p><p>responded to the government\'s statements by telling the </p><p>press, "we are concerned with keeping the country\'s soil and </p><p>airspace free from any foreign military presence targeting </p><p>Arab countries."  So far, there has been no apparent response </p><p>from Jordan\'s business community to the IAF\'s call and we </p><p>have heard of no vendors adhering to it. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We continue to expect the IAF to try to take advantage </p><p>of popular strong anti-war sentiments.  This particular </p><p>action is unlikely to generate a wide-spread response.  On </p><p>the heels of the largely unsuccessful boycott calls last </p><p>spring in response to the Israeli incursion in Jenin, </p><p>however, we might expect similar calls for boycotts of </p><p>American goods and services in the event of a conflict in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
