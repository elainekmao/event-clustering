(S/NF)  Begin Summary:  A violent demonstration that left </p><p>several demonstrators dead and injured near the Embassy has </p><p>dissipated and is over as of 1800 local time.  Embassy </p><p>reacted the Marine Security Guard and other measures in </p><p>response and informed the Embassy and American community of </p><p>the situation.  ROYG security response was strong, including </p><p>more than 2000 military and police forces, including three </p><p>tanks, demonstrating the government\'s commitment to </p><p>protecting Americans.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Demonstration Ended;  Situation Under Control </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  The demonstration that turned violent near the </p><p>Embassy has dissipated and is over as of 1800 local. </p><p>Demonstrators clashed with security forces at Sheraton Circle </p><p>(about 1/4 mile from Embassy).  Numbers were estimated at </p><p>5-7,000 demonstrators.  Security forces used tear gas and </p><p>shots in the air to attempt dispersal.  Embassy personnel at </p><p>the Sheraton reported witnessing shots being fired into the </p><p>crowd, and RSO received reports from our Local Guard Force </p><p>(LGF) that some demonstrators had weapons. Several </p><p>demonstrators have been reportedly killed and several police </p><p>injured.  MFA informed DCM that more than 2000 military and </p><p>police forces were deployed to respond to protect the </p><p>Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  A group of demonstrators gathered in Tahrir </p><p>Square near the center of Sanaa after Friday prayers (approx. </p><p>1230) and moved through the city past the Sheraton Hotel to </p><p>the intersection near the Sheraton (home of many Embassy </p><p>TDYers). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Yemeni security, including busloads of riot </p><p>police and water cannon, stopped the demonstrators from </p><p>coming closer to the Embassy.  Embassy received notice of a </p><p>petition, and the DCM prepared to go out and receive it.  Per </p><p>Embassy policy, three petitioners are allowed to come to give </p><p>the petition.  However, the demonstrators could not decide </p><p>which three should go and the Embassy refused to allow more. </p><p>At that time, the crowd became unruly and began to throw </p><p>stones.  Yemeni security reacted by firing tear gas and shots </p><p>in the air. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Several hundred demonstrators attempted to circle </p><p>around the Embassy but were met by security forces firing in </p><p>the air.  They were unable to approach the entrance. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  At this time, reports are that there are at least </p><p>four demonstrators killed, many injured and nine police </p><p>injured (mostly from stones).  Al Jazeera reported six </p><p>demonstrators killed at 1700 local time. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  RSO was informed by Yemeni security that an Amcit </p><p>journalist near the demonstration has been detained at a safe </p><p>location for his safety. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Embassy Response </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  Embassy reacted the Marine Security Guards and </p><p>advised the numerous personnel at the Embassy for StandFast </p><p>to remain indoors to avoid any stray bullets coming down. </p><p>RSO activated Embassy assets, including Force Protection </p><p>Detachment and SOC-Yemen, to provide additional protection. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  Warden Messages have been issued to Embassy </p><p>community to inform them of the demonstration and the </p><p>recommend they continue to stay put.  Several radio </p><p>announcements were made by RSO to inform Embassy personnel at </p><p>their residences and at the ACC to continue StandFast. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF)  Ambassador called a meeting at 1430 local to </p><p>discuss internal defense measures at the Embassy and other </p><p>issues.  Recommendations discussed include: </p><p> </p><p>-- a 24/7 watch being instituted from the Embassy roof. </p><p>-- LGF roving patrols continuing around the perimeter. </p><p> </p><p>-- Ensuring strong command and control structures under the </p><p>COM of all Embassy elements. </p><p> </p><p>-- Rules of Engagement regarding response should an </p><p>intruder(s) attempt to scale the perimeter walls, including </p><p>use of tear gas, the use of lethal force if entry to the </p><p>Chancery or Residence is attempted and procedures for LGF and </p><p>RSO response. </p><p> </p><p>-- DCM to ensure that Sheraton security is strengthened even </p><p>further, with the possibility of pulling Embassy personnel </p><p>there into the Embassy if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>(S/NF)  The 24th Marine Expeditionary Force called to give </p><p>their current position off Djibouti and to inform that they </p><p>can be available for rescue within 12 to 24 hours should the </p><p>situation warrant a forced evacuation. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>ROYG Response </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF)  DCM received phone calls from the MFA protocol </p><p>director providing assurances to the Embassy that the ROYG is </p><p>responding strongly to the situation.  He told the DCM that </p><p>more than 2000 military and police forces were deployed and </p><p>that the forces were expected to continue keeping the </p><p>demonstrators away from the Embassy.  He said the ROYG has a </p><p>"total commitment" to protect the Embassy and other </p><p>diplomatic missions.  He added that this commitment extended </p><p>to Embassy residences and the Sheraton Hotel, where he </p><p>realizes many Americans stay. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF)  Ambassador took a call from the Presidency </p><p>giving reassurance that they will take all "necessary </p><p>measures" to protect the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Press Reporting </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Television and wire services have been reporting </p><p>the demonstrations since 1500 local time.  Al-Jazeera reports </p><p>that six people have been killed in fierce clashes between </p><p>police and demonstrators near the Embassy. Wire services (AFP </p><p>and Reuters) have reported that tens of thousands of </p><p>demonstrators chanted "Death to America." and that one </p><p>policeman and three protesters were killed.   Yemeni </p><p>television and radio has not reported any news of the </p><p>demonstrations.  However, the English language newspaper the </p><p>Yemen Times has been running wire reports of the </p><p>demonstrations on its website.  PD has been fielding calls </p><p>from press about the situation and is drafting press </p><p>guidance. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
