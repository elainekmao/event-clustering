END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Second Round of Talks in Thailand </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Sri Lankan government and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are scheduled to hold their </p><p>second round of talks from October 31 - November 3.  The </p><p>Norwegian government is facilitating the talks.  As with </p><p>the first round of talks, which took place </p><p>September 16-18 (See Refs C-D), the venue for the second </p><p>round will be Thailand.  The meeting site has changed, </p><p>however, with the second round taking place in a hotel </p><p>just outside of Bangkok.  (Note:  The first round took </p><p>place at Sattahip Naval Base near Pattaya.  Per Ref B, </p><p>the venue for the third round of talks scheduled to take </p><p>place December 2-5 has been shifted to Norway.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) There have been changes to both sides\' </p><p>delegations.  Still led by veteran LTTE negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the LTTE delegation now also includes </p><p>political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam and eastern military </p><p>commander V. Karuna.  (Note:  Ref C contains bio-data on </p><p>these two LTTE officials.)  In addition to Ministers </p><p>Peiris and Moragoda, the government side now also </p><p>includes Major Gen. Shantha Kottegoda, the Sri Lankan </p><p>Army\'s Chief of the General Staff.  Despite serious </p><p>infighting in his party over the peace process </p><p>(See Ref C), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader </p><p>Rauf Hakeem is also expected to participate in the talks </p><p>as a member of the government team.  (Note:  There are </p><p>late reports that Hakeem has delayed his departure for </p><p>Bangkok because of the ongoing problems in his party.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Focus is Mainly on Technical Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) As previewed in Reftels, the second round of </p><p>talks is slated to focus mainly on the following </p><p>technical issues: </p><p> </p><p>-- Joint Task Force (JTF):  The two sides are expected </p><p>to spend a significant chunk of time deciding on the </p><p>exact "terms of reference" for the JTF.   Issues that </p><p>need to be resolved include exactly what role the JTF </p><p>will have with respect to the delivery of humanitarian </p><p>and developmental assistance to the north and east (as </p><p>well as to other parts of the country).  In an </p><p>October 29 meeting with the Ambassador and DCM before </p><p>leaving for Thailand, Minister for Economic Reform </p><p>Milinda Moragoda said the government wanted the JTF to </p><p>focus on setting "priorities" for assistance, as opposed </p><p>to being an implementing body.  In reference to the JTF </p><p>and its responsibilities, humanitarian mine action is </p><p>reportedly at the top of the agenda for the talks, as is </p><p>the issue of how to structure assistance to the Muslim </p><p>community in the east.  GSL-LTTE representation on the </p><p>JTF also has to be agreed on.  Moragoda said he wanted </p><p>Bernard Goonetilleke, the head of the GSL Peace </p><p>Secretariat and Ambassador to China, to head up the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>government side.  Goonetilleke\'s selection was not </p><p>finally settled, however.  For its part, the LTTE has </p><p>already named V. Balakumaran, a high-ranking Tiger </p><p>official, as its principal representative to the JTF. </p><p>(Note:  Ref C contains bio-data on Balakumaran.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Joint Committee on "High Security Zones":  The two </p><p>sides are also expected to agree on the modalities of </p><p>forming this committee, which will be focused on finding </p><p>ways to ease the burden on the local populace of the </p><p>GSL\'s "high security zones" in the north and east. </p><p>(Note:  The "high security zones" in question are large- </p><p>scale GSL military positions set up in the north and </p><p>east for defense in depth against possible LTTE attack. </p><p>Through the formation of these positions over the years, </p><p>local Tamils lost use of prime agricultural and other </p><p>land.)  One key issue expected to be discussed re this </p><p>committee are ways to ease the return of displaced </p><p>persons to their points of origin.  (Note:  There has </p><p>been a recent spurt in returns, with over 200,000 </p><p>people, most of them Tamils, returning to the north and </p><p>east since the advent of the peace process.)  Moragoda </p><p>told us that he expected that the GSL would name Defense </p><p>Secretary Austin Fernando to head up its representation </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>on this committee. </p><p> </p><p>-- Donor Conferences:  The two sides were also expected </p><p>to discuss the late November donor conference in Oslo </p><p>and the conference planned for next year in Japan. </p><p> </p><p>-- Agendas for Future Rounds:  According to GSL contacts </p><p>(also see Ref B), the two sides will also discuss the </p><p>agenda for the planned third round of talks in early </p><p>December and that of the fourth round scheduled to take </p><p>place January 6-9, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>-- Other Issues:  Moragoda also said his colleague G.L. </p><p>Peiris planned to discuss some human rights-related </p><p>issues with the LTTE.  (Note:  Moragoda was not clear </p><p>what these issues might be, but we guess that they have </p><p>something to do with the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- </p><p>"PTA."  The LTTE and other Tamils have been demanding </p><p>that those held under this act be released from </p><p>detention as soon as possible.  In response, the </p><p>government has publicly committed itself to releasing as </p><p>many PTA detainees as it can.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>No Fireworks Expected </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Keeping with the agenda of process oriented </p><p>discussions, fireworks are not expected.  Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Westborg told us that he did not expect the </p><p>second round to lead to the sort of dramatic </p><p>announcement made by LTTE senior negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham at the end of the first round.  (Note:  At </p><p>the press conference at the close of the first round, </p><p>Balasingham edged away from the LTTE\'s long-standing </p><p>demand for a separate "Tamil Eelam" entity.  This </p><p>announcement received widespread publicity.)  That said, </p><p>Moragoda told us that the second round of talks would </p><p>not be wholly technical in nature.  He noted that "core" </p><p>issues of sovereignty were entwined in discussing the </p><p>formation of the JTF, e.g., the GSL wanted the JTF to be </p><p>a quasi-governmental body, whereas the LTTE wanted it to </p><p>be an independent body separate from the Sri Lankan </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Amid the endemic cohabitation stresses and the </p><p>recent widening of fissures in the governing coalition, </p><p>the fact that the talks are taking place on schedule and </p><p>apparently in a positive atmosphere is good news for the </p><p>peace process.  It also works into the government\'s </p><p>"sloppy solution" strategy of trying to ensnare the </p><p>Tigers into a process of ever-increasing confidence </p><p>building on discrete "quality of life" issues, e.g., the </p><p>opening of roads, humanitarian issues, fishing rights, </p><p>etc.  In concentrating on these issues in the early </p><p>stages of the talks, the GSL would prefer not to grapple </p><p>with the controversial "final status" issues involved in </p><p>the Tigers\' demands.  Given calls by the president for </p><p>further definition of its long-term plans (see Ref C), </p><p>the government cannot avoid these larger, more </p><p>conceptual issues forever, but it still has some space </p><p>now.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
