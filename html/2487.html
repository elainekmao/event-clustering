<p>UNCLAS E F T O SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000496 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p>NOFORN </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, INL/AAE, INR/TNC, AF/RA AND DRL </p><p>PASS AID FOR G/WID-LYDAY </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB-ZOLLNER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KWMN, PHUM, PREF, NI, GN </p><p>SUBJECT: PROFILE OF A NIGERIAN SEX TRAFFICKING RING </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU/NF) A key prosecution witness in the case of 33 </p><p>trafficked Nigerian girls and women rescued in Conakry, </p><p>Guinea in July 2001 approached the Embassy for assistance and </p><p>was debriefed by the RSO and RNLEO.  The witness, a resident </p><p>of Benin City, Edo State, is married to a German woman and </p><p>until August 2001 was living and working as a taxi driver in </p><p>Conakry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU/NF) The witness explained that his cousin from Benin </p><p>City, who had always represented himself as a shoe salesman, </p><p>had invited the witness to visit Conakry, where the cousin </p><p>often traveled.  Upon arrival in Conakry in early 2001, the </p><p>witness did not find his cousin but decided to make ends meet </p><p>by working as a taxi driver while waiting for his cousin to </p><p>arrive.  He never met his cousin in Conakry but he stumbled </p><p>upon the cousin\'s true profession. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU/NF) While working in Conakry, the witness met a number </p><p>of Nigerian women who had been trafficked previously but were </p><p>now on their own in Guinea.  Some identified his cousin as a </p><p>major trafficker of girls and women from Edo State, Nigeria </p><p>to Spain and Italy.  From talking to Nigerian women in </p><p>Conakry, the witness learned of a large group of Nigerian </p><p>girls and women who were being detained in a Conakry house by </p><p>a ring of Nigerian traffickers.  Some of the girls were as </p><p>young as 13.  After notifying the Nigerian Embassy in </p><p>Conakry, he and the Nigerian Embassy were able to orchestrate </p><p>a Guinean police raid of the house, and 33 girls and women </p><p>were found.  They had been detained there for several weeks. </p><p>15 Nigerian traffickers, including a former Police </p><p>Commissioner of Edo State, were arrested and later extradited </p><p>to Nigeria, where they now face trial (in which the witness </p><p>will play a key role). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU/NF) The witness was flown out of Conakry with the </p><p>rescued trafficking victims aboard a Nigerian Air Force plane </p><p>on August 17.  The witness helped Guinean police interview </p><p>the trafficked victims immediately after their rescue and he </p><p>also helped with interrogations of the traffickers arrested </p><p>and later (November 2001) extradited to Nigeria.  The witness </p><p>has now become an essential part of the Federal Government\'s </p><p>prosecution of the 15 traffickers; he has been declared a </p><p>"protected witness" by the Special Assistant to the President </p><p>for Human Trafficking and Child Labor, Mike Mku, though that </p><p>protection has been weak at best. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU/NF) Unfortunately, though this case received President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s personal attention, a lack of federal resources </p><p>for the protection of trafficking victims resulted in the </p><p>release of the 33 rescued victims to their homes in Edo State </p><p>after 60 unhappy days of confinement in a Lagos police </p><p>facility, while the Federal government attempted </p><p>unsuccessfully to find long-term care and vocational training </p><p>for the girls and women.  According to the witness, who later </p><p>saw and talked with some of the victims back in Benin City, </p><p>about half of the 33 have already been re-trafficked to </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Conakry Connection </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU/NF) According to the witness, the Nigerian sex </p><p>trafficking trade is heavily entrenched in Conakry, where </p><p>genuine Guinean passports are easy to obtain through </p><p>fraudulent means and the Guinean police seem to tolerate the </p><p>lucrative human trade provided it not become a security </p><p>problem. After airlines and European immigration began </p><p>targeting the movement of trafficked girls and women via air </p><p>flights directly from Nigeria to Europe, traffickers began </p><p>using land routes through West Africa and the Sahara to get </p><p>their human cargoes to the brothels of Spain, Italy and the </p><p>Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU/NF) Women the witness interviewed in Conakry and the </p><p>victims themselves describe the prevailing trafficking route: </p><p> form Edo State through Lagos, Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana, </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire and finally, to Conakry.  Stops in Cotonou, </p><p>Lome, Accra and Abidjan are short and the traffickers have </p><p>accomplices with safe houses in these West African capitals. </p><p>Once in Conakry, the girls wait as long as a month while </p><p>fraudulently-obtained passports and other Guinean documents </p><p>are prepared for their onward journey.  Sometimes they are </p><p>pressed into servicing the local sex trade during this wait. </p><p>According to the witness, a great benefit of the Guinean </p><p>passport is that its holders do not need a visa for Morocco. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU/NF) Once a group of about 20-30 girls is ready for </p><p>onward movement, they are led by traffickers to Bamako, and </p><p>across the Sahara to Algiers, and from Algiers to Casablanca. </p><p> From interviews of women who had made the journey and been </p><p>caught in Spain -- and expelled back to Guinea -- the journey </p><p>through the desert takes two-three weeks and several girls </p><p>out of each group die along the way from heat exhaustion. </p><p>The traffickers reportedly own property in Bamako, Algiers </p><p>and Casablanca, which they use to house trafficked girls and </p><p>women in transit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trade Union for Traffickers? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU/NF)  The witness claims that 200-300 girls and women </p><p>had moved through Conakry along this route in the two to </p><p>three months preceding the July 2001 rescue of the 33.  At </p><p>least 1,000 sex trafficking victims pass through Conakry a </p><p>year, he estimates.  So deeply entrenched is the Nigerian </p><p>trafficking network in Conakry that the organization has a </p><p>"trade union" to protect them from government </p><p>anti-trafficking efforts and provide them with top-quality </p><p>legal services if they get in trouble.  Even before the </p><p>traffickers were extradited from Guinea, a lawyer was </p><p>enlisted to defend them in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU/NF) Once in Casablanca, the traffickers arrange for </p><p>small boats to carry the Nigerian girls and women from the </p><p>Moroccan coast to "Suta Island," purportedly a Spanish </p><p>possession near Gibraltar. This boat trip is dangerous, as it </p><p>is usually made at night to avoid Spanish and Moroccan naval </p><p>patrols, and trafficking victims sometimes fall overboard and </p><p>drown.  Those who make it successfully to Spain without being </p><p>detected by Spanish security personnel are either put to work </p><p>in Spanish brothels or moved overland to Italy for work </p><p>there.  According to the witness, these brothels are operated </p><p>by Nigerian traffickers or former trafficked girls and women </p><p>who have survived, paid off their debts of over $50,000 and </p><p>managed to graduate to brothel-operator status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU/NF) The witness claims his life is in danger as the </p><p>group of traffickers awaiting trial is extremely powerful and </p><p>has sent him a number of death threats.  The witness claims </p><p>that the traffickers\' lawyer visited him in his Benin City </p><p>home and warned him against being a witness for the federal </p><p>government in this case.  Shortly thereafter, his uncle was </p><p>beaten up and a relative\'s house was burned to the ground; </p><p>following these developments, he and his immediate family </p><p>boarded up their house and fled Benin City.  Confirming the </p><p>common impression of Benin City, the witness claimed it is a </p><p>hub or organized crime, particularly human traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU/NF) The witness claimed his is now living on the </p><p>streets of Abuja, surviving on the little assistance the </p><p>federal government can give him and any other sources of </p><p>charity he can find.  He asked the Embassy for assistance and </p><p>for asylum in the U.S. RSO and RNLEO explained that this </p><p>trafficking case does not involve the United States, and </p><p>therefore the USG cannot play a role in the prosecution or </p><p>his protection.  RNLEO acceded to the witness\' request, </p><p>however, that an Embassy representative attend the March 23 </p><p>opening of the criminal trial in the federal High Court </p><p>(Lagos) to show that the international community has an </p><p>interest in seeing justice served in this landmark case. </p><p>RNLEO also agreed to raise the witness\' plight with Mike Mku. </p><p> (Note: Mku Later told RNLEO that he greatly values the </p><p>witness\' cooperation and crucial role in the prosecution of </p><p>the 15 traffickers but cannot obtain sufficient funds to </p><p>protect the witness in a hotel or other safe location. End </p><p>note.) </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
