<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS STEP UP PRE-TALK DEMANDS, </p><p>COMPLAINTS AGAINST GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 0312 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The declaration of a ceasefire between the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents on January 29 has led to </p><p>little discernible progress toward actual peace negotiations </p><p>thus far.  Neither side has committed to a code of conduct </p><p>governing the truce, the GON has not yet named its </p><p>negotiating team, and neither a date nor a venue for talks </p><p>has been agreed upon.  The Maoists are exploiting the </p><p>apparent lack of movement to complain about the GON\'s failure </p><p>to meet their ever-burgeoning list of demands, while </p><p>continuing to send out feelers to the mainstream political </p><p>parties and, more recently, selected embassies.  The Palace\'s </p><p>continued delay in enlisting the support of the political </p><p>parties has left the GON ill equipped to counter the Maoists\' </p><p>two-pronged charm offensive, relying instead on the able--but </p><p>by no means infallible--Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for </p><p>Physical Works, as its public face on the peace process. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>MAOIST LIST OF DEMANDS, ANTI-GON COMPLAINTS LENGTHENS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  As the ceasefire between the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) and the Maoists enters its fifth week, there have been </p><p>no indications that the two sides are substantially closer to </p><p>agreeing to a timetable or agenda for negotiations than when </p><p>the truce was first announced.  Neither side has yet </p><p>committed to a code of conduct governing offensive and </p><p>defensive actions during the ceasefire, despite the plethora </p><p>of draft codes being churned out by assorted human rights </p><p>groups, including the National Human Rights Commission, on </p><p>almost a daily basis.  Other than Narayan Singh Pun, Minister </p><p>of Physical Planning, the GON has not yet appointed any other </p><p>negotiators to its team, although it has announced the </p><p>formation of a blue-ribbon panel, including a former Army </p><p>Chief and former Chief of Police, to advise the team once </p><p>talks begin. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The Maoists, meanwhile, appear to be intensifying </p><p>their anti-GON propaganda, using the mainstream media to </p><p>publicize an ever-growing list of new pre-conditions </p><p>(including the repeal of anti-terrorism legislation passed in </p><p>the previous Parliament; the release of all Maoist detainees; </p><p>and the recall of the Royal Nepal Army to barracks) that they </p><p>then castigate the GON for having failed to meet.  The </p><p>insurgents have begun flagging such "failures" in their </p><p>public statements as possible reasons the ceasefire may </p><p>eventually  break down.  For example, in an interview </p><p>published February 28 in a leading vernacular daily, Maoist </p><p>negotiator Krishna Mahara blamed the post-ceasefire arrests </p><p>of several Maoist cadre for making the Maoists "less assured" </p><p>about the future of peace talks.  One day later, the </p><p>Kathmandu Post, the largest-circulation English daily, </p><p>reported Mahara and fellow Maoist spokesman Dinanath Sharma </p><p>as citing the GON\'s "unnecessary delay" in naming members of </p><p>its negotiating team as evidence that it is "neglecting the </p><p>truce."  Ratcheting up the volume one notch higher, Maoist </p><p>negotiator Mahara was quoted in the mainstream press yet </p><p>again on March 5 as warning that the insurgents might pull </p><p>out of peace talks completely unless the GON orders the Army </p><p>confined to barracks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The GON, however, is unlikely to issue such a </p><p>redeployment order.  In the absence of a code of conduct, </p><p>many commanders have ordered their troops to apprehend </p><p>Maoists observed openly carrying arms.  Brig. Gen. Gaurav </p><p>Rana, commander of the 5th Brigade in the far-western region, </p><p>told us he has given his soldiers standing orders to make </p><p>such arrests.  Soldiers under his command arrested 14 armed </p><p>Maoists at a public meeting in Kanchanpur District and </p><p>clashed with armed Maoists in Bajhang District, killing two, </p><p>at the end of February.  Since then, he noted, sightings of </p><p>armed Maoists in his AOR have declined markedly. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MAOISTS MEETINGS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Maoists are also continuing efforts to reach </p><p>out to the mainstream political parties, both in Kathmandu </p><p>and in remote rural districts (Reftel).  The parties </p><p>obviously are flattered by the attention and seeming respect </p><p>accorded them--especially when they feel themselves ignored </p><p>and slighted by the Palace.  Party leaders  rush to report </p><p>the meetings, complete with Maoist party line, to the local </p><p>media, thereby ensuring the insurgents free, sometimes </p><p>sympathetic front-page coverage.  For example, mainstream </p><p>dailies on March 4 carried a Nepali Congress Central </p><p>Committee member\'s account of one such meeting, including </p><p>verbatim Maoist complaints of the GON "not fulfilling its </p><p>part for peaceful dialogue," coupled with the disingenuous </p><p>claim that the Maoists are committed to safeguarding </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Along with the charm offensive targeting political </p><p>parties, the Maoists are sending out feelers to certain </p><p>diplomatic missions in Kathmandu.  The Danish DCM told our </p><p>DCM that his mission, along with such others as the Swiss and </p><p>Norwegians, had recently received a back-channel request for </p><p>a meeting with unidentified Maoist representatives.  The </p><p>Danish DCM said that no such meeting had yet been agreed to </p><p>or scheduled, although he indicated the request was under </p><p>active review.  He undertook to advise us of any further </p><p>developments. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PALACE PUTS STOCK IN PUN </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Maoist pitch to the parties may be receiving a </p><p>comparatively sympathetic reception in part because the </p><p>Palace persists in neglecting them.  Pashupati Rana, General </p><p>Secretary of the National Democratic Party (which is </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>generally perceived as closest to the Palace), told the DCM </p><p>that he believes King Gyanendra is unrealistically confident </p><p>that the current discussions will lead, eventually, to a </p><p>stable peace.  Rana said that the King, who has had little </p><p>previous experience with this kind of political dialogue, may </p><p>be over-estimating prospects for peace and may thus </p><p>(mistakenly) be in no hurry to cultivate the parties.  In </p><p>Rana\'s view, the King may be putting too much faith in the </p><p>abilities of Minister Pun, whose political acumen for this </p><p>particular task Rana doubts.  (Rana himself has not met with </p><p>the King since the declaration of the ceasefire.)  A </p><p>prominent banker who had known the King well during his days </p><p>as Nepal\'s leading businessman noted a naivete about certain </p><p>topics--unexpected in someone with a reputation as a savvy </p><p>entrepreneur--that he suspects may be coloring the monarch\'s </p><p>interpretation of Maoist motives and his expectations for </p><p>successful dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Former colleagues of Pun from the Nepali Congress </p><p>Party like Ram Sharan Mahat, a former finance and foreign </p><p>minister, and C.P. Bastola, a former foreign minister and </p><p>negotiator in the last round of talks, echo some of Rana\'s </p><p>reservations about whether Pun has the political canniness to </p><p>deal with the cagey and manipulative Maoists.  (Note:  Mahat </p><p>and Bastola may have their own partisan reasons to criticize </p><p>Pun, who left the Nepali Congress to form his own party, as </p><p>well.  End note.)  Critics of the GON\'s reliance on Pun as </p><p>sole point-man note that the GON ceded much to gain the </p><p>ceasefire, including the withdrawal of its designation of the </p><p>Maoists as terrorists, without obtaining commensurate </p><p>concessions from the Maoists.  Even the Maoists\' purported </p><p>commitment to drop their objection to the constitutional </p><p>monarchy appears to be more illusory than actual.  According </p><p>to the Indian Ambassador, Pun has admitted that he has been </p><p>unsuccessful in obtaining the written renunciation of such </p><p>anti-monarchical aims from Maoist leader Prachanda that Pun </p><p>had claimed to have in hand before announcement of the </p><p>ceasefire.  Since Pun had indicated that the King made Maoist </p><p>acceptance of the constitutional monarchy a pre-condition to </p><p>talks, the admission that the GON has no such commitment has </p><p>deepened the Indian Ambassador\'s already pessimistic view of </p><p>prospects for productive dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  (C)  Many observers remain suspicious about the Maoists\' </p><p>true intentions in agreeing to the ceasefire, fearing they </p><p>may use the moratorium to resupply, regroup, and recruit, </p><p>rather than to seek a peaceful, negotiated settlement.  The </p><p>Maoists\' front-page grousing about the GON\'s failure to </p><p>fulfill an ever-shifting list of unrealistic demands mirrors </p><p>their behavior during the previous abortive round of talks in </p><p>late 2001, and could indicate that they are laying the </p><p>groundwork for an evenual walk-out.  Before such an event </p><p>takes place, however, we expect the Maoists will send ample </p><p>warning--most likely through surrogate mouthpieces in </p><p>far-left political and human rights organizations--claiming </p><p>the futility of further dialogue for spurious reasons.  Pun </p><p>seems a relatively good choice as lead GON interlocutor with </p><p>the Maoists for a number of reasons.  He appears genuinely </p><p>committed to working for the national good and lacks the </p><p>narrow partisanship that poisons so much of Nepal\'s domestic </p><p>political discourse.  As a former Army officer, he is more </p><p>likely to be trusted as an honest broker by the security </p><p>forces and the Palace.  At the same time, as a Magar tribal </p><p>from the remote northwestern district of Myagdi, he shares </p><p>the same ethnicity and a similar background as many Maoist </p><p>foot-soldiers.  That said, his lack of experience as a </p><p>negotiator raises legitimate questions regarding his ability </p><p>to see through Maoist chicanery.  We continue to be concerned </p><p>by the Palace\'s delay in more effectively enlisting the </p><p>parties\' support.  However well-intentioned Pun may be, his </p><p>efforts are unlikely to succeed as long as the parties feel </p><p>they are being purposely excluded--a point the Maoists, in </p><p>their continuing outreach to mainstream political </p><p>leaders--seem to appreciate fully. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
