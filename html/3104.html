<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001146 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT CHALLENGED IN SUPREME </p><p>COURT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1005 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Four cases have been filed in the Supreme Court </p><p>challenging the May 22 dissolution of the Lower House of </p><p>Parliament (Reftel).  The cases will be heard June 19.  Two </p><p>Constitutional experts believe that defendant Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba has the stronger case.  Both cautioned, </p><p>however, that the uniqueness of this particular case, in </p><p>comparison with the three previous dissolutions since 1994, </p><p>offers some latitude for judicial interpretation that could </p><p>possibly argue for reinstatement of Parliament.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>COURT CHALLENGES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) A total of four different groups of plaintiffs have </p><p>filed petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the May 22 </p><p>dissolution of the Lower House of Parliament.  The Court </p><p>ordered Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who initiated the </p><p>dissolution, to give a written response to the petitions </p><p>(called a "show cause order") by June 17. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) One of the cases was filed by a private lawyer the </p><p>day after the dissolution on May 23.  The other three </p><p>complaints (one from another private attorney; one from five </p><p>MPs from the left-wing United People\'s Front party; and one </p><p>from 56 Nepali Congress MPs in the just-dissolved Parliament) </p><p>were all filed on June 5.  The cases will all be heard </p><p>together on June 19 by a bench composed of more than half of </p><p>the Court\'s 19 justices.  It is estimated that the court may </p><p>take up to one month to decide the case.  (Note:  It is not </p><p>yet clear whether PM Deuba will be represented solely by </p><p>Attorney General Prem Bahadur Bista, or whether he will </p><p>exercise his option to have a private attorney represent him </p><p>as well.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PLENTY OF PRECEDENTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) May 22 marked the fourth time the House of </p><p>Representatives, the Lower House of Parliament, has been </p><p>dissolved since 1994.  In the first case, the Supreme Court </p><p>upheld the decision of then-Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, </p><p>whose Nepali Congress Party enjoyed a majority government at </p><p>the time of dissolution.  The Supreme Court upheld </p><p>reinstatement of Parliament in the two subsequent cases (1995 </p><p>and 1998), which were initiated by Prime Ministers in </p><p>minority governments.  In the 1995 case, moreover, then-Prime </p><p>Minster Man Mohan Adhikari moved to dissolve Parliament only </p><p>after a no-confidence motion had been filed against him. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>EXPERT OPINIONS:  PM LIKELY TO PREVAIL </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Constitutional architects Dham Nath Dhungana (who </p><p>argued two of the previous cases before the Supreme Court) </p><p>and former Chief Secretary Tirtha Man Sakya both opined that </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is on firmer legal ground </p><p>than any of the challengers.  First, Deuba has the </p><p>Constitutional authority to ask the King to dissolve </p><p>Parliament (Article 53, Clause 4).  Second, Deuba headed a </p><p>majority government at the time of dissolution, just as </p><p>Koirala did when the Supreme Court upheld his bid to dissolve </p><p>Parliament in 1994.  Finally, unlike former PM Adhikari in </p><p>1995, he moved against Parliament before a no-confidence </p><p>motion was filed against him. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  A challenge to the current dissolution might, </p><p>however, offer significant latitude for judicial </p><p>interpretation, Dhungana speculated, because neither Deuba </p><p>nor the King followed established precedent in moving for </p><p>dissolution.  In previous cases, for example, the PM had </p><p>forwarded his request for dissolution to the King via the </p><p>Council of Ministers.  In the current case, Deuba appears to </p><p>have bypassed his Cabinet completely and gone straight to the </p><p>King to ask for dissolution (Reftel).  The late King </p><p>Birendra, who had presided over the previous three bids for </p><p>dissolution, "consulted" with the heads of political </p><p>parties--even if only in a pro forma fashion--before moving </p><p>to dissolve.  In one of the cases he also consulted with </p><p>legal authorities before making his decsion.  When his </p><p>brother Gyanendra, however, announced the dissolution, it was </p><p>literally at the eleventh hour--just before midnight--without </p><p>notifying any of the political leaders of his intentions </p><p>beforehand.  Both Dhungana and Sakya agree that neither the </p><p>King nor the PM is legally required to consult anyone before </p><p>moving for dissolution, and Sakya suggested the King may have </p><p>assumed the precedent set by the decision dissolving </p><p>Koirala\'s majority government in 1994 offered him a basis to </p><p>proceed without further consultation. </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Sakya also agreed the current case could offer </p><p>limited leeway for judicial interpretation.  He cited the </p><p>opinion rendered by the Supreme Court in the 1995 and 1998 </p><p>cases, which cautioned that to the extent possible, a Prime </p><p>Minister should seek remedies to policy impasses within </p><p>Parliament before moving for dissolution.  As long as the </p><p>possibility exists to form an alternative--even a </p><p>coalition--government, Parliament should not be dissolved.  A </p><p>case could be made that Deuba ignored this directive by not </p><p>attempting to form a coalition government to overcome the </p><p>deadlock within his own party over extending the emergency </p><p>(Reftel).  Article 45, Clause 3 of the Constitution also </p><p>allows for the one-year extension of Parliament during a </p><p>state of emergency--another option the PM did not allow to </p><p>play out.  Finally, Sakya noted that the current Chief </p><p>Justice\'s voting record--against the dissolution of </p><p>Parliament in 1998--could also be a factor. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The Constitution stipulates the involvement of </p><p>only two people--the King and the Prime Minister--in a </p><p>decision to dissolve Parliament.  Custom and practice, </p><p>however, have stipulated that the PM and/or King must make at </p><p>least a pro forma attempt to inform--if not consult--other </p><p>players, such as the Cabinet and the heads of political </p><p>parties, in the process.  The eleventh-hour decision to </p><p>dissolve Parliament May 22 may not have violated the </p><p>Constitution, but it did violate many observers\' notions of </p><p>accepted practices in Nepal\'s turbulent and divisive domestic </p><p>political scene.  It will be difficult for the plaintiffs to </p><p>show that Deuba\'s action was against the law.  They can, </p><p>however, raise difficult questions about his motivations in </p><p>this very public forum. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
