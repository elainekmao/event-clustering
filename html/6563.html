<p>UNCLAS MBABANE 000147 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S(BARNES), AF/PD(DALTON), DRL(BRYANT) </p><p>USTR FOR C.MOORE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, AGOA, WZ </p><p>SUBJECT: THE JET SAGA:  IS AN END IN SIGHT? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A: 02 MBABANE 623, B:  02 MBABANE 767, C: 02 MBABANE 782 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  A SELECT COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT HAS </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND THREE OTHER </p><p>CABINET MINISTERS ACTED ILLEGALLY IN CONTRACTING TO </p><p>PURCHASE A PRIVATE JET FOR KING MSWATI III AT AN </p><p>ESTIMATED COST OF $72 MILLION USD.   THE COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>CHAIR AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>AND POLOFF IN SEPARATE MEETINGS THAT IN SPITE OF THE </p><p>REPORT, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE NOW FACING INTENSE </p><p>PRESSURE FROM THE PM TO APPROVE THE RELEASE OF FUNDS </p><p>FOR THE PURCHASE.  ALTHOUGH PARLIAMENT IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>VOTE AGAIN ON THE MATTER WITHIN WEEKS, IT IS NOT CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE KING OR PM WILL ACCEPT ANYTHING EXCEPT A </p><p>DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE PURCHASE.  IF THIS PROVES </p><p>TRUE, THE KING, WHO RECENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE DOES </p><p>NOT RESPECT PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, WILL </p><p>HAVE MADE PARLIAMENTARY INDEPENDENCE THE SECOND </p><p>CASUALTY OF HIS ABSOLUTE RULE IN RECENT MONTHS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS </p><p>SAGA OF THE GKOS SCHEME TO BUY A JET FOR THE KING, A </p><p>SELECT COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT RECENTLY REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE A TEAM INCLUDING THE PM, THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>WORKS AND TRANSPORT, THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, AND THE </p><p>MINISTER OF ECONOMIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT (EP&D) </p><p>ACTED ILLEGALLY UNDER A "ROYAL MANDATE" IN USING PUBLIC </p><p>FUNDS TO PURCHASE A BOMBARDIER JET FOR THE KING WITHOUT </p><p>FIRST SEEKING PARLIAMENT\'S APPROVAL (REF A AND B). </p><p>THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT: THE MINISTER FOR EP&D </p><p>ILLEGALLY DIRECTED THAT ONE MILLION USD BE TAKEN FROM </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FUNDS TO ACQUIRE THE JET; THE MINISTER OF </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS ILLEGALLY SIGNED FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS FOR </p><p>THE PURCHASE WITHOUT SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE ON THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE AGREEMENTS; THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>ILLEGALLY ORDERED THE TEAM TO REDIRECT MONEY ALREADY </p><p>ALLOCATED BY PARLIAMENT TOWARDS THE PURCHASE; AND THE </p><p>MINISTER OF FINANCE ILLEGALLY PERMITTED THE TAKING OF </p><p>FUNDS FOR THE $2.8 MILLION USD DEPOSIT FROM DEVELOPMENT </p><p>FUNDS, THE SWAZI NATIONAL TREASURY, AND THE ROYAL SWAZI </p><p>AIRLINE. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE COMMITTEE ALSO CONCLUDED THAT ALTHOUGH THE KING </p><p>DID NOT ORDER THE INVOLVED MINISTERS TO DISREGARD </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR COMMITTING PUBLIC FUNDS, </p><p>HE GAVE CLEAR DIRECTION THAT HE WANTED THE JET.  AMONG </p><p>THE DISCOVERIES THE COMMITTEE FOUND MOST TROUBLING WAS </p><p>THE FACT THAT NO ONE IN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>PRODUCE ANY RECEIPTS FOR THE $2.8 MILLION USD ALREADY </p><p>PAID.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMMITTEE HAS NO WAY OF </p><p>KNOWING WHETHER THE MONEY EVER EVEN REACHED ITS </p><p>INTENDED RECIPIENT OR WHETHER ILLEGAL COMMISSIONS WERE </p><p>PAID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE COMMITTEE HAS ADVISED THE GKOS TO CEASE EFFORTS </p><p>TO PROCEED WITH THE PURCHASE AND TO RECOUP THE MONEY </p><p>ALLEGEDLY ALREADY PAID.  BUT THE PM HAS REFUSED TO </p><p>ACCEPT THIS RECOMMENDATION AND INSTEAD IS LOBBYING THE </p><p>MPS TO PERMIT THE DEAL TO GO AHEAD.  MANY MPS WE HAVE </p><p>SPOKEN TO VOW THAT IN THE UPCOMING VOTE, THEY WILL </p><p>AFFIRM THEIR EARLIER DECISION REJECTING THE PURCHASE </p><p>(REF C). </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  GIVEN THE DISREGARD BOTH THE KING AND PM </p><p>HAVE SHOWN IN RECENT MONTHS FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE </p><p>AND THE RULE OF LAW, SOME GOVERNMENT CRITICS HAVE </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT REGARDLESS OF PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>DECISION, THE SWAZI PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE HUNGRY AND </p><p>DYING OF HIV/AIDS, WILL SOME DAY WATCH AS THEIR LEADER </p><p>TAKES HIS INAUGURAL FLIGHT ON HIS 72 MILLION DOLLAR </p><p>BOMBARDIER EXECUTIVE JET. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCGEE </p><p></p></div>
