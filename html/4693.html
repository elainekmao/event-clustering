SUMMARY:  On October 21, Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>assisted by USAID Mission Director Liberi, </p><p>National Action Committee on AIDS (NACA) </p><p>Chairperson Osotimehin, Lagos Consul General, </p><p>Mission Officers, and Percy Wilson, an AFR/SD </p><p>HIV/AIDS Consultant, hosted a highly successful </p><p>luncheon for 20 prominent, largely American, </p><p>business leaders in Lagos to discuss the role of </p><p>the private sector in combating HIV/AIDS in </p><p>Nigeria.  The event resulted in the formation of a </p><p>critical new public/private alliance for the </p><p>Nigerian HIV/AIDS effort.  The business leaders </p><p>agreed to form a committee in support of NACA that </p><p>will meet quarterly to explore ways to use the </p><p>private sector\'s core competences to strengthen </p><p>the Nigerian program and to review progress.  The </p><p>NACA Chairperson also suggested the formation of a </p><p>working group that will convene during the </p><p>intervals between committee meetings to facilitate </p><p>communication and strengthen collaboration between </p><p>his office and the committee.  In addition, </p><p>Osotimehin indicated that he will invite several </p><p>business leaders to serve on NACA\'s governing </p><p>board.  The group concluded the luncheon by </p><p>generating a list of opportunities for </p><p>public/private sector collaboration.  Subsequent </p><p>response to this initiative has been uniformly </p><p>positive and has included both public and private </p><p>sector proposals to promote the new partnership. </p><p>The Ambassador has agreed to host an HIV/AIDS </p><p>public partnership luncheon on a quarterly basis. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS:  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>thanked the business representatives for honoring </p><p>his invitation, and then focused his remarks on </p><p>the status of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.  He highlighted </p><p>the urgency of the situation by quoting the recent </p><p>National Intelligence Council report that Nigeria, </p><p>along with India, China, Russia and Ethiopia, is </p><p>predicted to become a crisis point for HIV/AIDS in </p><p>the next ten years unless urgent and effective </p><p>measures are taken.  Emphasizing the impact that </p><p>an uncontrolled pandemic could have on business </p><p>plans, operations, and profits, the Ambassador </p><p>appealed to the business leaders to lend their </p><p>support to the efforts of the public sector and </p><p>NACA to address this emerging catastrophe in </p><p>Nigeria.  Jeter noted that Nigeria already has the </p><p>most HIV-infected adults and AIDS orphans in West </p><p>Africa, and stressed the U.S. commitment to </p><p>support the Government of Nigeria in its efforts </p><p>to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS.  This was </p><p>expressed through the USG\'s dramatic increase in </p><p>funding since 1999, and an inter-agency, multi- </p><p>tiered effort through USAID, DoD, CDC, USDoL and </p><p>NGO\'s, foundations, and universities to address </p><p>the problem.  The Ambassador conclude by </p><p>emphasizing that it was in the business </p><p>community\'s own interest to joint the HIV/AIDS </p><p>fight in Nigeria, which would greatly benefit from </p><p>the organizational, managerial, and communications </p><p>skills of the business community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   USAID MISSION DIRECTOR\'S REMARKS:  USAID </p><p>Mission Director Dawn Liberi said that although </p><p>there is some disagreement about the extent of the </p><p>pandemic and the exact number of HIV infected </p><p>persons, there is no disagreement that the AIDS </p><p>pandemic in Nigeria has attained proportions that </p><p>demand urgent and effective intervention.  She </p><p>described USAID\'s program in support of the </p><p>Government of Nigeria\'s HIV/AIDS efforts, and </p><p>noted that the USG is the single largest donor to </p><p>the Nigerian HIV/AIDS efforts.  Ms. Liberi said </p><p>that the USG\'s contribution has increased from </p><p>$2.8 million in 1999 to $14.5 million in 2002 and </p><p>that contribution will increase even further to </p><p>$20.5 million in 2003.  After citing several </p><p>existing USAID programs, Ms. Liberi underlined </p><p>that USAID is seeking new opportunities to expand </p><p>collaboration with the business sector, stating </p><p>that USAID recognizes the vibrancy and vitality of </p><p>the private sector and the potential role it can </p><p>play in this effort.  She also ended her remarks </p><p>by inviting the business community to join NACA </p><p>and USAID in the Nigerian war against HIV/AIDS. </p><p>4.  NACA CHAIRMAN\'S REMARKS:  Professor Osotimehin </p><p>briefed the group on the work currently being </p><p>carried out by NACA, in particular the </p><p>Presidential Action Committee\'s awareness </p><p>campaign.  He said that HIV/AIDS is a priority for </p><p>President Obasanjo and that the President is </p><p>giving his full support to NACA\'s work.  He </p><p>assured the business community that NACA operates </p><p>with total transparency.  Professor Osotimehin </p><p>stressed NACA\'s understanding of the critical </p><p>importance of building its capacity to be able to </p><p>provide leadership to the nation in the fight </p><p>against AIDS.  In this regard, the NACA </p><p>Chairperson reported that NACA recently signed a </p><p>MOU with Coca-Cola Company.  He said that Coca- </p><p>Cola will use its advertising and distribution </p><p>infrastructure to support NACA\'s national program. </p><p>Osotimehin stated that getting the message out to </p><p>the public is very important to create an enabling </p><p>environment to contain and reduce the country\'s </p><p>prevalence rate.  Professor Osotimehin closed by </p><p>inviting other companies to forge a partnership </p><p>with NACA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  AFR/SD CONSULTANT\'S REMARKS:  Percy Wilson, a </p><p>retired Coca-Cola director with many years of </p><p>experience in Nigeria, and contracted by AFR/SD to </p><p>spearhead the public/private HIV/AIDS effort, </p><p>underscored the importance of partnership.  He </p><p>shared his belief that the private sector\'s core </p><p>competences in communication, marketing, </p><p>operations and distribution can be of significant </p><p>value to the public sector in program development </p><p>and implementation.  Wilson stressed that to </p><p>achieve positive results it is critical that the </p><p>Nigerian AIDS campaign be built on a foundation of </p><p>total value chain management.  Private </p><p>sector/public sector human and fiscal resource </p><p>leveraging must be the centerpiece of the </p><p>management plan.  He further emphasized that </p><p>combating HIV/AIDS is a community problem and </p><p>therefore a total community effort is required to </p><p>combat the disease.  Mr. Wilson described two </p><p>models for private sector/public sector </p><p>partnerships:  1) The Merck Foundation/Merck & </p><p>Co., Inc., the Government of Botswana, and the </p><p>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and 2) the recent </p><p>partnership between the Coca-Cola Company, the </p><p>Government of Nigeria (NACA) and UNICEF.  He </p><p>appealed to the group to join forces to develop a </p><p>well thought out strategic plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE BUSINESS LEADERS:  The </p><p>Coca-Cola Company and Chevron underscored the need </p><p>to work in partnership with the public sector </p><p>because it is the correct thing to do as well as </p><p>being in the best interest of business.  Other </p><p>members of the business community echoed this </p><p>sentiment.  CONOCO expressed the importance of </p><p>being socially correct and making sure the </p><p>business community respects local culture and </p><p>customs.  Professor Osotimehin assured the group </p><p>that NACA recognizes this as important and that </p><p>the organization is in dialogue with national and </p><p>local community and faith leaders in that regard. </p><p>In summary, the business community expressed </p><p>willingness to use their core compenences to </p><p>combat HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MEETING RESOLUTIONS:  Ambassador Jeter\'s </p><p>subsequent offer to facilitate a quarterly meeting </p><p>resulted in a resolution by the business </p><p>representatives to form an important new public </p><p>sector/private sector alliance.  Professor </p><p>Osotimehin expressed interest in establishing a </p><p>working group for the committee that will meet in </p><p>the interval between quarterly meetings to promote </p><p>the committee\'s agenda and strengthen </p><p>collaboration between NACA and the business </p><p>community.  He also indicated that he would invite </p><p>several members of the business community to serve </p><p>on NACA\'s governing committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  PUBLIC/PRIVATE SECTOR ALLIANCE OPPORTUNITIES: </p><p>Members of the group identified the following </p><p>opportunities for the new partnership: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  i.  Information gathering (e.g., NACA will </p><p>      provide the committee with the soon-to-be </p><p>      released NACA institutional strengthening </p><p>      assessment) and data sharing (e.g., one oil </p><p>      company will seek ways to share with NACA </p><p>      its data on the percentage of its employees </p><p>      and their dependents who are HIV positive). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> ii.  Use of the new wireless Internet technology </p><p>      that will soon be introduced in Nigeria to </p><p>      transmit awareness and prevention messages </p><p>      to rural areas and to assist in data </p><p>      collection for the new management </p><p>      information system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>iii.  Mapping private sector locations and </p><p>      programs to encourage further collaboration </p><p>      with public sector programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> iv.  Applying private sector core competences to </p><p>      launch a national awareness campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  v.  Using private sector merchandise packaging </p><p>      to transmit AIDS\' prevention and awareness </p><p>      messages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  SUBSEQUENT RESPONSES:  Subsequent responses to </p><p>this initiative have been rapid and uniformly </p><p>positive.  Dates have been set for the next two </p><p>follow-on luncheons, for instance, and Professor </p><p>Osotimehin has hired an assistant who will assume </p><p>responsibility for liaison with the business </p><p>committee and for prompt responses to all </p><p>committee requests.  One company represented at </p><p>the luncheon has already contacted a USAID </p><p>implementing partner for assistance with </p><p>developing appropriate HIV/AIDS prevention </p><p>messages for its packaging.  Other participants </p><p>have subsequently stated their appreciation for </p><p>the opportunities discussed at the luncheon and </p><p>have reaffirmed their commitment to involve their </p><p>companies in the national AIDS effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. COMMENT:  As previously reported (reftel), the </p><p>Mission has been at the forefront in providing </p><p>support to the dynamic new NACA leadership.  The </p><p>luncheon hosted by Ambassador Jeter marked a </p><p>critical new departure in this support and was </p><p>responsive to the NACA Chairman\'s request </p><p>emanating from Percy Wilson\'s previous consultancy </p><p>for USG assistance in engaging the private sector. </p><p>With the exception of the recent Coca-Cola </p><p>initiative, the business sector has been </p><p>conspicuously absent in the Nigerian HIV/AIDS </p><p>effort.  This is no longer the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. COMMENT (cont):  The new public/private sector </p><p>partnership  that resulted from the Ambassador\'s </p><p>luncheon is critical to NACA\'s effort to create a </p><p>multi-sectoral response.  Furthermore, the </p><p>creation of the public/private alliance will </p><p>facilitate implementation of USAID\'s proposed new </p><p>five-year strategy.  Many of the employees of </p><p>companies attending the luncheon (e.g., oil-rig </p><p>and oil-service workers, transport workers, </p><p>construction workers) serve as critical "bridging" </p><p>agents for the spread of HIV to the general </p><p>population.  The targeting of high-risk and </p><p>"bridging" groups will be a critical element of </p><p>the new USAID five-year strategy and the creation </p><p>of this partnership will greatly facilitate access </p><p>to these groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
