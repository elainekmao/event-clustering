<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001646 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, IZ, PGOV, EAID, IZ, IT, ITPREL, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALY\'S IRAQ TASK FORCE SEEKING TO LOCATE </p><p>FIELD HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01646  01 OF 02  161555Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 1618 </p><p>     B. ROME 1577 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY DCM EMIL SKODON, REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 9. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  POLMIN COUNSELOR AND ECONOFF MET LATE APRIL </p><p>14 WITH ANTONIO BADINI, MFA IRAQ TASK FORCE COORDINATOR, AND </p><p>HIS DEPUTY, LUIGI MACCOTTA.  BADINI NOTED THAT PM BERLUSCONI </p><p>HAD GIVEN HIS BLESSING TO SENDING INTEGRATED FORCES TO IRAQ </p><p>AND ENDORSED THE ARGUMENT THAT FOMIN FRATTINI WAS TO MAKE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 15 (REF A).  BADINI CONFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>GOI HAS SELECTED AMBASSADOR ANTONIO ARMELLINI TO WORK WITH </p><p>ORHA, BUT NOTED THAT THE MOD HAD YET TO SELECT A GENERAL TO </p><p>SERVE AS HIS ADVISOR.  BADINI ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT A TEAM OF </p><p>EXPERTS WAS BEING ASSEMBLED TO WORK ON THE REBUILDING OF </p><p>IRAQI INSTITUTIONS IN FIVE AREAS: HEALTH/SANITATION, WATER, </p><p>ELECTRICITY, SEA/AIRPORTS, AND DEMINING/WMD.  BADINI </p><p>DISCUSSED HOW THE GOI WAS MOBILIZING TO MEET OUR FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL REQUEST, AND MACCOTTA LATER ADDED THAT, GIVEN </p><p>ITALY\'S EXPERIENCE WORKING ON BAGHDAD HOSPITALS (REF B), THE </p><p>GOI WOULD LIKE TO LOCATE THE HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD ITSELF.  IN </p><p>SEPARATE MEETINGS, WE LEARNED THAT ON APRIL 10 THE MFA SENT </p><p>AN EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN AID SHIPMENT TO THE REGION IN </p><p>COORDINATION WITH ICRC.  FINALLY, WE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR </p><p>DETAILS ON ANY NEEDS THE COALITION MIGHT HAVE FOR ITALIAN </p><p>AUDITING AND BANK SUPERVISORY EXPERTISE IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN THE COURSE OF OUR MEETING WITH BADINI, IT WAS CLEAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01646  01 OF 02  161555Z </p><p>THAT HE WAS ASSIMILATING THE ROLE OF GOI TASK FORCE </p><p>COORDINATOR.  HAVING RECEIVED BERLUSCONI\'S BLESSING, AND </p><p>CONFIDENT ABOUT RECEIVING PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT, BADINI </p><p>REPORTED RECEIVING GOOD COOPERATION FROM HIS COLLEAGUES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY MOD, AND NOTED THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY MADE INDEPENDENT PROPOSALS WOULD NOW WORK "AS PART </p><p>OF THE TEAM."  THAT SAID, BADINI LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING </p><p>BETTER QUALITY INFORMATION FROM ITALY\'S CENTCOM LNO, GENERAL </p><p>SANTINI.  IN PARTICULAR, BADINI IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE KINDS OF MEDICAL CASES THAT THE </p><p>HOSPITAL WOULD NEED TO TREAT, WHERE IT WOULD BE DEPLOYED, AND </p><p>WHAT KINDS OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR IT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BADINI ALSO NOTED THAT, ACCORDING TO HIS MILITARY </p><p>COLLEAGUES, IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MOBILIZE IN "LESS </p><p>THAN 20 DAYS."  (IN A SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION ON APRIL 16, </p><p>DEPUTY TASK FORCE COORDINATOR LUIGI MACCOTTA WAS MORE </p><p>OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE GOI\'S ABILITY TO MOBILIZE SOONER.) </p><p>POLMIN COUNSELOR UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A </p><p>MODULAR APPROACH: FIELDING A GOOD, ALBEIT BASIC, HOSPITAL </p><p>QUICKLY RATHER THAN A PERFECT ONE SLOWLY.  THE TASK FORCE </p><p>WILL MEET APRIL 17 TO RESPOND CONCRETELY TO OUR FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL REQUEST.  BADINI ENVISIONS AN INTEGRATED HOSPITAL </p><p>WITH PERSONNEL FROM THE CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT, THE </p><p>ARMY, ITALIAN RED CROSS, AND MEDICAL STAFF FROM THE ITALIAN </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.  IF THE </p><p>FIELD HOSPITAL WERE TO BE READY BEFORE THE MILITARY IS READY, </p><p>HE SAID, SOME KIND OF ADVANCE TEAM WOULD BE ASSEMBLED WITHOUT </p><p>WAITING FOR A FULL MILITARY COMPLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BADINI STRESSED, MEANWHILE, THAT ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01646  01 OF 02  161555Z </p><p>DETAILS THAT WE COULD PROVIDE REGARDING NEEDS WOULD BE </p><p>WELCOMED.  POLMIN COUNSELOR MENTIONED THAT THE GOI MAY BE </p><p>ASKED TO LOCATE ITS HOSPITAL IN A SOUTHERN IRAQI CITY, OTHER </p><p>THAN BASRAH (WHERE A CZECH FIELD HOSPITAL IS BEING SET UP), </p><p>AND REMINDED BADINI THAT, AS IT WOULD BE IN A MILITARY </p><p>THEATER, THE HOSPITAL MUST BE UNDER CENTCOM COMMAND.  IN A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION, MACCOTTA SAID THAT THE TASK FORCE IS </p><p>THINKING OF LOCATING THE FIELD HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD ITSELF. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT ITALIANS WORKED ON THE REHABILITATION OF BOTH A </p><p>GENERAL AND PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD FOLLOWING THE 1991 </p><p>WAR AND WOULD LIKE TO USE THE FIELD HOSPITAL AS A WAY TO </p><p>REBUILD MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE CAPITAL IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>EXISTING FACILITIES.  BADINI SAID THE TASK FORCE COULD </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF A FIELD HOSPITAL IN STAGES AND </p><p>WOULD DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS OF DOING SO AT THE UPCOMING </p><p>MEETING.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT, WHILE HE WAS AWAITING THE MOD\'S </p><p>NOMINATION OF A GENERAL TO SEND TO IRAQ, AMBASSADOR ARMELLINI </p><p>COULD DEPART "IN TEN DAYS."  NOTE: ANTONIO ARMELLINI IS </p><p>WELL-KNOWN TO THE USG.  HE HAS SERVED AS ITALY\'S AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO ALGERIA AND DCM IN LONDON.  IN HIS LAST POST, AS MFA </p><p>COORDINATOR FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, HE WAS AN ESPECIALLY </p><p>CAPABLE AND VALUED CONTACT.  BIO CABLE TO FOLLOW SEPTEL.

(C) SPEAKING LONGER-TERM, BADINI POINTED OUT THAT ITALY </p><p>WANTED FIRST TO GIVE GENEROUSLY TO IRAQ HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, BUT EVENTUALLY TO BE WELL-POSITIONED TO USE ITS </p><p>LONG-STANDING KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE IN THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT.  BADINI NOTED THAT APART </p><p>FROM ITALY, THE FRENCH, RUSSIANS AND GERMANS KNOW THE IRAQI </p><p>MARKET, SUGGESTING THAT INASMUCH AS THERE IS A POLITICAL </p><p>COMPONENT INVOLVED IN ACCESSING THE MARKET, ITALY\'S SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE COALITION SHOULD BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION.  BADINI </p><p>ADDED THAT, APART FROM HEALTH, ITALY WAS CONCENTRATING ITS </p><p>ATTENTION ON THE WATER AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN A BRIEF PULL-ASIDE MEETING APRIL 14 WITH FINANCIAL </p><p>EXPERT IN THE MFA\'S MID-EAST BUREAU, DR. ANDREA POMPERMAIER, </p><p>WE WERE TOLD THAT THE MFA WAS WILLING TO MOBILIZE AUDITING </p><p>AND BANK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE, AS NEEDED, TO SEND TO IRAQ. </p><p>POMPERMAIER ASKED FOR MORE DETAIL ON HOW MANY BANKING EXPERTS </p><p>AND WHAT SPECIFIC SKILL SETS WOULD BE OF USE AS HE PREPARES A </p><p>REQUEST TO THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION AND THE BANK OF </p><p>ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN A CONVERSATION LATE APRIL 15 WITH DR. TOMBACINI OF </p><p>THE MFA\'S EMERGENCY OFFICE, ECONOFF LEARNED THAT EVEN BEFORE </p><p>THE RECENT PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE OVER ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ </p><p>UNFOLDED, THE GOI\'S FIRST EMERGENCY RESPONSE HAD ALREADY BEEN </p><p>DELIVERED.  LATE LAST WEEK, THE MFA\'S DG FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>COOPERATION SENT A PLANE CARRYING EUROS 250,000 WORTH OF </p><p>PRIMARILY MEDICAL SUPPLIES, BUT ALSO SANITATION KITS, </p><p>NON-PERISHABLE FOOD, ELECTRIC GENERATORS, BLANKETS AND TENTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01646  02 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>TO KUWAIT CITY.  ITALIAN AMBASSADOR PARTI IN KUWAIT HAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY BEEN COORDINATING ON THE GROUND WITH THE HOC AND </p><p>ICRC.  THE FLIGHT ARRIVED IN KUWAIT CITY ALONG WITH A TEAM OF </p><p>FIVE FROM THE MFA INCLUDING: THE VICE DG FOR DEVELOPMENT, THE </p><p>EMERGENCY OFFICE DIRECTOR, TWO LOGISTICIANS, AND A MEDICAL </p><p>DOCTOR.  DISTRIBUTION OF THE ITEMS IN IRAQ IS BEING </p><p>COORDINATED PRIMARILY BY THE ICRC. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUESTS.  WITH PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>APPROVAL OF GOI ENGAGEMENT IN IRAQ, THE MFA TASK FORCE IS </p><p>FINDING NEW VIGOR AND AUTHORITY IN ITS COORDINATING ROLE.  IN </p><p>NAMING AMBASSADOR ARMELLINI TO BE ITS LIAISON WITH ORHA, THE </p><p>GOI IS DEMONSTRATING AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO </p><p>IRAQ.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE TIMELY FEEDBACK TO THE TASK FORCE </p><p>AS IT ASSEMBLES ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS, POST AGAIN REQUESTS </p><p>DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE ON A RESPONSE TO THE GOI\'S PROPOSED </p><p>LIAISON WITH ORHA AND DISPATCHING TECHNICAL EXPERTS IN THE </p><p>FIVE AREAS NOTED (REF B).  IN ADDITION, ANY FURTHER GUIDANCE </p><p>REGARDING THE FIELD HOSPITAL AND ITS POTENTIALLY BEING </p><p>LOCATED IN BAGHDAD, AS WELL AS NEEDS FOR BANKING EXPERTISE, </p><p>WOULD BE WELCOMED.  END COMMENT AND ACTION REQUESTS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01646 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
