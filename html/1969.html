<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 004755 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE(MENNUTI), PD/PA/EUR (HILTON) </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 151/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE AND VATICAN STAND WITH UNITED STATES </p><p> </p><p>1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II CONDEMNED THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. TARGETS USING SOME OF THE STRONGEST </p><p>LANGUAGE EVER HEARD BY POST STAFF. IN HIS SEPTEMBER 12 </p><p>GENERAL AUDIENCE IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE, BREAKING WITH </p><p>TRADITION, SPOKE SOLELY IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN. THE USUALLY </p><p>FESTIVE OCCASION OF THOUSANDS OF PILGRIMS AND TOURISTS </p><p>CHANTING AND WAVING NATIONAL FLAG WAS TURNED INTO A SOLEMN </p><p>MOMENT OF REFLECTION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   VATICAN TRANSLATION OF POPE\'S REMARKS IN ITALIAN </p><p>FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>I CANNOT BEGIN THIS AUDIENCE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY PROFOUND </p><p>SORROW AT THE TERRORIST ATTACKS WHICH YESTERDAY BROUGHT </p><p>DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO AMERICA, CAUSING THOUSANDS OF </p><p>VICTIMS AND INJURING COUNTLESS PEOPLE. TO THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AND TO ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS I EXPRESS MY </p><p>HEARTFELT SORROW. IN THE FACE OF SUCH UNSPEAKABLE HORROR WE </p><p>CANNOT BUT BE DEEPLY DISTURBED. I ADD MY VOICE TO ALL THE </p><p>VOICES RAISED IN THESE HOURS TO EXPRESS INDIGNANT </p><p>CONDEMNATION, AND I STRONGLY REITERATE THAT THE WAYS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE WILL NEVER LEAD TO GENUINE SOLUTIONS TO HUMANITY\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS. YESTERDAY WAS A DARK DAY IN THE HISTORY OF </p><p>HUMANITY, A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO HUMAN DIGNITY. AFTER </p><p>RECEIVING THE NEWS, I FOLLOWED WITH INTENSE CONCERN THE </p><p>DEVELOPING SITUATION, WITH HEARTFELT PRAYERS TO THE LORD. </p><p>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMMIT ACTS OF SUCH SAVAGE CRUELTY? </p><p>THE HUMAN HEART HAS DEPTHS FROM WHICH SCHEMES OF UNHEARD-OF </p><p>FEROCITY SOMETIMES EMERGE, CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IN A MOMENT </p><p>THE NORMAL DAILY LIFE OF A PEOPLE. BUT FAITH COMES TO OUR </p><p>AID AT THESE TIMES WHEN WORDS SEEM TO FAIL. CHRIST\'S WORD IS </p><p>THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN GIVE A RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS WHICH </p><p>TROUBLE OUR SPIRIT. EVEN IF THE FORCES OF DARKNESS APPEAR TO </p><p>PREVAIL, THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD KNOW THAT EVIL AND DEATH </p><p>DO NOT HAVE THE FINAL SAY. CHRISTIAN HOPE IS BASED ON THIS </p><p>TRUTH; AT THIS TIME OUR PRAYERFUL TRUST DRAWS STRENGTH FROM </p><p>IT. WITH DEEPLY FELT SYMPATHY I ADDRESS MYSELF TO THE </p><p>BELOVED PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS MOMENT OF </p><p>DISTRESS AND CONSTERNATION, WHEN THE COURAGE OF SO MANY MEN </p><p>AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL IS BEING SORELY TESTED. IN A SPECIAL </p><p>WAY I REACH OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THE DEAD AND THE INJURED, </p><p>AND ASSURE THEM OF MY SPIRITUAL CLOSENESS. I ENTRUST TO THE </p><p>MERCY OF THE MOST HIGH THE HELPLESS VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGEDY, </p><p>FOR WHOM I OFFERED MASS THIS MORNING, INVOKING UPON THEM </p><p>ETERNAL REST. MAY GOD GIVE COURAGE TO THE SURVIVORS; MAY HE </p><p>SUSTAIN THE RESCUE-WORKERS AND THE MANY VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE </p><p>PRESENTLY MAKING AN ENORMOUS EFFORT TO COPE WITH SUCH AN </p><p>IMMENSE EMERGENCY. I ASK YOU, DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, TO </p><p>JOIN ME IN PRAYER FOR THEM. LET US BEG THE LORD THAT THE </p><p>SPIRAL OF HATRED AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT PREVAIL. MAY THE </p><p>BLESSED VIRGIN, MOTHER OF MERCY, FILL THE HEARTS OF ALL WITH </p><p>WISE THOUGHTS AND PEACEFUL INTENTIONS. TODAY, MY HEARTFELT </p><p>SYMPATHY IS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SUBJECTED YESTERDAY TO </p><p>INHUMAN TERRORIST ATTACKS WHICH HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT HUMAN BEINGS AND CAUSED UNSPEAKABLE </p><p>SORROW IN THE HEARTS OF ALL MEN AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL. </p><p>YESTERDAY WAS INDEED A DARK DAY IN OUR HISTORY, AN APPALLING </p><p>OFFENCE AGAINST PEACE, A TERRIBLE ASSAULT AGAINST HUMAN </p><p>DIGNITY. I INVITE YOU ALL TO JOIN ME IN COMMENDING THE </p><p>VICTIMS OF THIS SHOCKING TRAGEDY TO ALMIGHTY GOD\' S ETERNAL </p><p>LOVE. LET US IMPLORE HIS COMFORT UPON THE INJURED, THE </p><p>FAMILIES INVOLVED, ALL WHO ARE DOING THEIR UTMOST TO RESCUE </p><p>SURVIVORS AND HELP THOSE AFFECTED. I ASK GOD TO GRANT THE </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE THEY NEED AT THIS </p><p>TIME OF SORROW AND TRIAL. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.   COMMENT: THE TONE OF THE POPE\'S REMARKS AND THE </p><p>MODIFIED GENERAL AUDIENCE INDICATE THE SERIOUSNESS WITH </p><p>WHICH THE VATICAN TAKES THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM AND ITS </p><p>ESTEEM FOR THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF </p><p>AMERICA. THE ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON RECEIVED </p><p>BANNER HEADLINES IN THE SEPTEMBER 12 EDITION OF THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S DAILY NEWSPAPER, L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO. AMBASSADOR </p><p>NICHOLSON WILL RESPOND PERSONALLY TO THE PAPAL EXPRESSION OF </p><p>SOLIDARITY SEPTEMBER 13 WHEN HE PRESENTS HIS CREDENTIALS TO </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL II. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p></p></div>
