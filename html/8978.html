<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004066 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, TU, TIP IN TURKEY </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT EXPRESSES DETERMINATION ON ANTI-TIP EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 171293 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) June 23 DCM delivered reftel talking points to </p><p>Ambassador Umur Apaydin, MFA Director General for Consular </p><p>Affairs.  Apaydin stated GOT would review USG </p><p>trafficking-in-persons (TIP) recommendations and guide its </p><p>work as appropriate.  Noting strong bilateral cooperation and </p><p>thorough police investigations, Apaydin emphasized that </p><p>recent GOT efforts to combat TIP continue to accelerate.  He </p><p>affirmed the GOT\'s Anti-Trafficking-in-Persons (TIP) Task </p><p>Force\'s commitment to fighting TIP remained strong and </p><p>expressed a desire for further cooperation amongst source and </p><p>destination countries.  Given the GOT\'s achievements, Apaydin </p><p>asked for the source of contrary information on Turkey and </p><p>sought clarification of the benchmarks laid out by G/TIP for </p><p>the annual report.  While the GOT was "disappointed" in </p><p>Turkey\'s Tier III ranking and this might be demotivating for </p><p>some of the officials in the task force, he stated Turkey\'s </p><p>commitment to expanding its anti-TIP efforts would continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>A Stronger Commitment to Cooperation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Apaydin stated he would leave 6/24 to attend the </p><p>Stability Pact\'s meeting in Bucharest as the GOT national </p><p>coordinator for TIP.  After attending many of these meetings, </p><p>he stated he found them to be a useful tool for learning </p><p>about TIP and, more important, learning how Turkey fits as a </p><p>destination country.  He emphasized the GOT\'s dialogue with </p><p>all source and transit countries, including Ukraine, was a </p><p>broad exchange of ideas and underscored that the GOT was in </p><p>regular contact with all relevant countries.  Apaydin noted </p><p>the GOT and IOM were in frequent communication regarding a </p><p>wide spectrum of anti-TIP efforts, including a repatriation </p><p>program.  Some of the USG recommendations, most notably a </p><p>public awareness campaign aimed at end-users, he added, were </p><p>very useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Apaydin pointed to an on-going investigation </p><p>involving police officials possibly implicated in TIP as a </p><p>success of the GOT\'s anti-TIP training and commitment.  He </p><p>promised the GOT would continue to provide information on </p><p>TIP-related investigations and prosecutions. (Note: We will </p><p>follow up on the investigation of possible police corruption. </p><p> End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A Desire for Better Understanding </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Apaydin raised the issue that many TIP experts vary on </p><p>which steps are the most important: some emphasize </p><p>legislative steps, such as outlawing "bogus" marriages, while </p><p>others stress victim programs.  He noted that while the GOT </p><p>has endeavored to meet all aspects of TIP, expanded </p><p>cooperation would help reconcile discrepancies amongst </p><p>information.  Within this context, Apaydin requested the USG </p><p>to cite sources on negative information in order for the GOT </p><p>to be able fully to investigate and determine whether or how </p><p>their programs might be misfiring.  We pressed Apaydin for </p><p>better collection of statistics as well as anecdotal evidence </p><p>that would clarify the picture on TIP prevention, protection, </p><p>and prosecution in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While our approach elicited a useful discussion about </p><p>the USG recommendations, the steps provided in reftel do not </p><p>represent clear, objective benchmarks - benchmarks that are </p><p>necessary to provide appropriate guidance to the GOT on what </p><p>steps are required for Tier II.  Apaydin noted, "While the </p><p>USG report allows TIP to remain at the forefront of </p><p>government objectives, it is frustrating to implement many </p><p>anti-TIP steps only to be told later they are not </p><p>sufficient."  If we cannot set and maintain clear goalposts, </p><p>this process will prove counterproductive to our ability to </p><p>enhance cooperation against Trafficking-in-Persons and to </p><p>other interests and objectives in Turkey. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
