<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000751 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CASC, BEXP, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS REPORTEDLY LINK ATTACK ON COCA-COLA </p><p>FACILITY TO U.S. AFFILIATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 747 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 69408 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 439 </p><p>     D. (D) KATHMANDU 209 </p><p>     E. (E) 01 KATHMANDU 2324 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The Nepali manager of a Coca-cola </p><p>factory where Maoists set off two bombs the night of April 14 </p><p>(Ref A) said the armed attackers told Coke employees at the </p><p>plant their facility was being targeted because of its </p><p>affiliation with the U.S. and because of USG aid to victims </p><p>of the Maoist insurgency (Ref B).  No one was injured in the </p><p>blasts, but damage to the factory will delay continued </p><p>production for at least another 15 days.  The bombers\' </p><p>statement marks the first time the insurgents have linked a </p><p>particular action by the USG to one of their attacks.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  N.N. Singh, Managing Director of Coca-Cola in </p><p>Nepal, told RSO and poloff that estimates of the damage </p><p>inflicted by two bomb blasts set by Maoists at the facility </p><p>in Narayangadh April 14 are still incomplete (Ref A).  The </p><p>capping and filling machines were both damaged, Singh said, </p><p>necessitating the shutdown of production for at least 15-20 </p><p>days.  No one was injured in the attack, and police have made </p><p>no arrests. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Singh reported that five armed men entered the </p><p>plant about 7:45 p.m. on April 14.  After rounding up the </p><p>three unarmed security guards, the electrician, the boiler </p><p>operator, the night supervisor, and five people who were in </p><p>the cafeteria, one of the intruders began lecturing them. </p><p>According to the employees\' account, the man emphasized that </p><p>the Maoists had nothing personally against any of the </p><p>employees and did not intend to harm them.  Since, however, </p><p>Coca-cola is a symbol of American imperialism, the insurgents </p><p>are targeting the facility.  The man took special note of </p><p>recent press items announcing a USG grant of USD 100,000 to </p><p>assist victims of the insurgency (Ref B).  Since the USG is </p><p>giving USD 100,000, we are damaging this factory worth half a </p><p>million dollars, the man reportedly stressed.  Following this </p><p>explanation, the man\'s companions then set off the two bombs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Noting that Sunday\'s incident marks the third time </p><p>a Coca-cola facility has been attacked since November (Refs D </p><p>and E), Singh commented that his own and the Ambassador\'s </p><p>requests for increased police protection for the two </p><p>facilities (Ref C) were not enough to avert this latest </p><p>incident.  The police chief has posted patrols around both </p><p>facilities, Singh acknowledged, but patrols alone are not </p><p>effective in deterring such attacks.  He said he has </p><p>personally asked the police chief for armed policemen to be </p><p>posted inside both plants, but the Chief has always declined, </p><p>saying he does not have the manpower to grant Singh\'s </p><p>request.  Coca-cola logos are prominent all over Nepal, Singh </p><p>continued.  If the Maoists have made it plain that they </p><p>consider Coca-cola a legitimate target, every Coca-cola </p><p>delivery truck in the country could be threatened.  He asked </p><p>that the Embassy again raise security at the facilities with </p><p>the police.  RSO and poloff undertook to do so. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Press items reporting real and </p><p>apochryphal USG aid to the Government of Nepal have increased </p><p>markedly in the past few months.  This incident, however, </p><p>marks the first time to our knowledge that the Maoists have </p><p>articulated a specific connection between a USG action--in </p><p>this case, the grant--and an attack.  The Embassy has </p><p>received no other communications or information regarding </p><p>possible threats to other U.S.-affiliated entities or </p><p>individuals.  The EAC will discuss next steps at its April 22 </p><p>meeting. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
