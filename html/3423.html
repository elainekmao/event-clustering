<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002276 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA, OPDAT AND ICITAP </p><p>. </p><p>DEA FOR OFE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2017 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DEMARCHE </p><p>DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 124582 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  The Ambassador\'s recent delivery of the </p><p>annual narcotics certification benchmarks to Attorney General </p><p>Kanu Agabi led to an expanded discussion of broader law </p><p>enforcement issues.  Agabi asked for USG understanding of the </p><p>GON\'s current budget woes, for which he blamed the lack of </p><p>adequate NDLEA funding, but pledged closer cooperation in </p><p>addressing the myriad narcotics, crime and policing concerns </p><p>shared by both countries.  Noteworthy was his pledge to work </p><p>closely with the High Court Chief Judge to ensure USG </p><p>extradition cases are assigned to the most capable and honest </p><p>judges and prosecutors.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) On July 12 Ambassador Jeter met with the Attorney </p><p>General in his Ministry of Justice office to deliver the </p><p>annual narcotics certification demarche (reftel).  RNLEO </p><p>accompanied.  The Attorney General expressed appreciation for </p><p>the Embassy\'s patience and persistence in seeking GON </p><p>approval of the Bilateral Law Enforcement Assistance </p><p>Agreement recently signed on July 2.  Explaining the issue of </p><p>Police resistance to placing a USDOJ ICITAP police advisor in </p><p>Nigerian Police Force headquarters, Agabi bluntly stated, </p><p>"they don\'t want the US to see the crimes they commit there." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) After explaining the background and timetable of the </p><p>certification process, as well as its ramifications for </p><p>bilateral and multilateral assistance, the Ambassador walked </p><p>the AG through the eight benchmark categories set out for </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The Attorney General listened attentively to the </p><p>various points and desired accomplishments for the year.  In </p><p>response to USG concerns that the NDLEA receive adequate </p><p>funding as the sole anti-drug agency in Nigeria, Agabi </p><p>described the budget crisis afflicting most government </p><p>agencies, including the NDLEA.  He pledged to argue the </p><p>NDLEA\'s budgetary needs with President Obasanjo and </p><p>encouraged the Ambassador to do the same. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extradition </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Ambassador Jeter praised the AG for his robust </p><p>cooperation on the first successful extradition to the U.S. </p><p>in many years.  He asked Agabi if this was the result of an </p><p>improved extradition process, to which the AG answered </p><p>indirectly that he had personally supervised the extradition </p><p>case.  Stating that "we at the Ministry promise to do our </p><p>best," Agabi cautioned that he could not control Nigeria\'s </p><p>independent judiciary, which he characterized as riddled with </p><p>corruption.  Expressing extreme frustration in attempting to </p><p>get judicial officials to deliver efficient and sound </p><p>judgements in extradition cases, he unguardedly mused that </p><p>perhaps he needed to "bribe judges to do the right thing," if </p><p>this became necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Agabi pledged to personally oversee all future USG </p><p>extradition requests.  The Attorney General said he would </p><p>consult with the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, </p><p>Rosaline Ukeje, to have a "good" judge such as the one who </p><p>presided over the Umoh hearing, selected for extradition </p><p>cases.  Bringing into the meeting Ministry prosecutor Obi </p><p>Agusioba, who argued the government\'s case for Gabriel Umoh\'s </p><p>extradition, Agabi stated he would put this prosecutor on the </p><p>next case and would monitor its progress closely.  (Note: </p><p>The AG on July 29 signed the order for the High Court to </p><p>begin extradition proceedings in the case of Daniel Orhiunu. </p><p>A judge for the case has yet to be named.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Legislative Largess </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) When pressed on the apparent inactivity on passage of </p><p>the draft Financial Crimes Commission Act, introduced to the </p><p>National Assembly in January, the AG decried the corruption </p><p>among national legislators.  He recalled his first term as </p><p>Attorney General under President Obasanjo when he lobbied the </p><p>Assembly for passage of the Anti-Corruption Bill (which </p><p>established the Anti-Corruption Commission).  An unnamed </p><p>Committee Chairman requested a large sum of money to pass the </p><p>legislation.  A more recent example of legislative corruption </p><p>was the federal government\'s attempt to pass a resource </p><p>control bill, for which a group of legislators demanded $5 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abacha Loot -- the Deal </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) The Ambassador asked Agabi about the deal between the </p><p>Obasanjo government and the Abacha family.  The AG confirmed </p><p>recent discussions with the family\'s lawyers led to an </p><p>agreement that the Abachas would return $1.2 billion in </p><p>looted funds in return for amnesty from further assets </p><p>investigations.  The AG noted that no funds have yet been </p><p>returned to the federal government accounts but this should </p><p>be accomplished in the next two to three months.  Pointing to </p><p>the July 11 Supreme Court ruling releasing Muhammed Abacha </p><p>(son of the late dictator) of any charges in the murder of </p><p>Kundirat Abiola (wife of the putative winner of the annulled </p><p>1993 elections), Agabi stated the ruling was part of the </p><p>deal, "though you won\'t find that in the formal written </p><p>agreement."  The AG further stated that, despite the Supreme </p><p>Court\'s ruling in favor of Mohammed, the dictator\'s son would </p><p>remain in jail on fraud charges until "the money is </p><p>returned." (Comment:  The AG seemed to acknowledge implicitly </p><p>that the judiciary is being manipulated to make the deal </p><p>work.  Mohammed Abacha remains in jail three weeks after the </p><p>Supreme Court ruling, although the justification for holding </p><p>him is not clear. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The Ambassador noted that the FBI has been assisting </p><p>the GON in its quest to investigate and retrieve </p><p>misappropriated funds in the U.S. and asked if the deal </p><p>struck with the Abachas meant the assistance was no longer </p><p>needed.  The Attorney General stated that the "hunt will </p><p>continue" despite the deal with the Abachas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Demarche Delivery to NDLEA </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) On July 22, Ambassador Jeter delivered the </p><p>certification benchmarks demarche to NDLEA Chairman Bello </p><p>Lafiaji.  Lafiaji appeared defensive on the expressions of </p><p>concern over limited NDLEA efforts in drug interdiction and </p><p>investigations of major drug traffickers.  He bemoaned the </p><p>lack of Federal funding for his agency, blaming severe </p><p>financial constraints for the NDLEA\'s inability to perform </p><p>better. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) He asked the Ambassador to lobby President Obasanjo </p><p>for increased funding while at the same time requesting </p><p>additional INL assistance for NDLEA commodities, particularly </p><p>five new vehicles to support the Joint Task Force that works </p><p>with DEA.  The Ambassador noted that INL assistance has been </p><p>substantial (over $500,000 in the past 12 months) and will </p><p>continue, though funding for FY01 and FY02 have already been </p><p>earmarked for specific commodities for the NDLEA.  He </p><p>pledged, however, to raise the NDLEA\'s budgetary needs with </p><p>the President at the next available opportunity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) On the issue of money laundering and the need to </p><p>address the FATF\'s concerns, Lafiaji put the blame at the </p><p>doorstep of the Finance Ministry, which manages the Central </p><p>Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  The NDLEA chief suggested the </p><p>Ambassador bring CBN officials together with the Attorney </p><p>General, the Police and himself to discuss how to improve </p><p>anti-money laundering performance.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>responded that we hope to host an informal law enforcement </p><p>roundtable at the Embassy in the coming weeks, to include the </p><p>Attorney General, senior Police Officials, the NDLEA Chairman </p><p>and others.  Though the main theme for these discussions will </p><p>be the new forms of "419" advance-fee fraud, we could easily </p><p>discuss the FATF concerns on money laundering controls and </p><p>invite senior CBN officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) Comment:  Noticeable progress has been made in the </p><p>areas of drug interdiction, extradition, and fighting 419 </p><p>fraud, though clearly much more needs to be done.  Money </p><p>laundering and major drug investigations seem to be the areas </p><p>of least achievement for Nigerian law enforcement efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) The ineffectual National Assembly is the major </p><p>obstacle to the promulgation of new legislation to confront </p><p>money laundering.  The June 21 FATF report on Non-Cooperating </p><p>Countries and Territories, which noted a complete lack of </p><p>progress on Nigeria\'s part, appears to have caught the </p><p>attention of many including the President and we will use the </p><p>FATF\'s warning of impending "counter-measures," to be imposed </p><p>on October 31 absent any discernable progress, to prod the </p><p>GON to move decisively on the necessary legislation and </p><p>bureaucratic structure.  The Ambassador will also urge </p><p>President Obasanjo to give the NDLEA more than the modest 157 </p><p>million naira (approximately $1.1 million) allotted to the </p><p>agency so far this fiscal year. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
