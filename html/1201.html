<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 003616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICAN DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, US </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER PROTESTS ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY </p><p>ACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03616  031658Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON JULY 3 FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE </p><p>GRANTED AMBASSADOR MCDONALD AN AUDIENCE TO REGISTER HIS </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT PASSAGE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT IN </p><p>THE SENATE.  IN THIS CONNECTION, THE MINISTER SAID HE </p><p>WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT THE FLURRY OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES TARGETING ZIMBABWE FOR "SANCTIONS". </p><p>HE SAID THAT HE HAD INSTRUCTED HIS AMBASSADOR IN </p><p>WASHINGTON TO PROTEST THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON AFRICA\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO INVITE ANYONE FROM THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO TESTIFY AT ITS JUNE 13 HEARING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) "WE ARE A DEVELOPING NATION AND IT IS UNFAIR TO </p><p>JUDGE US BY THE STANDARDS OF YOUR COUNTRY," MUDENGE </p><p>STATED, WAVING AWAY AMBASSADOR MCDONALD\'S POINTED </p><p>ASSERTIONS THAT THE SENATE\'S BILL WAS A BIPARTISAN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE SINCE EARLY THIS YEAR, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION PERPETRATED BY THE </p><p>RULING ZANU-PF PARTY IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTIONS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE MINISTER TO TREAT THE SENATE </p><p>BILL AND THE HOUSE HEARING AS A "WAKE-UP CALL" TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS POLICIES.  THE </p><p>MINISTER RESPONDED THAT "WE WILL HAVE TO STUDY THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES" OF THE BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW.  "THEN </p><p>ZIMBABWE WOULD HAVE TO CRAFT A PROGRAM TO SURVIVE," HE </p><p>ADDED.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD REJOINED THAT ZIMBABWE COULD </p><p>DO A NUMBER OF THINGS BETWEEN NOW AND THE POTENTIAL </p><p>ENACTMENT OF THE BILL IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN </p><p>ORDER TO BEGIN TO GARNER SOME GOODWILL IN WASHINGTON. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED, "STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03616  031658Z </p><p>NEGATIVE PUBLIC RELATIONS IMAGE AND TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ACTION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT."  PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>STATEMENT TO CNN ON SATURDAY, JULY 1, ABOUT CONTINUING </p><p>THE FARM OCCUPATIONS AND NOT FORCING THE REMOVAL OF WAR </p><p>VETERANS, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTER, WERE VERY </p><p>UNHELPFUL IN TONE AND WILL NOT ASSIST IN SOLVING THE </p><p>LAND PROBLEM.  "ZIMBABWEANS WILL BE ZIMBABWEANS," THE </p><p>MINISTER NOTED, AND "WE\'LL RESIST ANYONE WHO TRIES TO </p><p>DIRECT US."  "WE\'LL FIGHT WITH OUR WORDS," HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE SENATE LEGISLATION AND IMPLICATIONS </p><p>THAT IT HAS FOR ZIMBABWE IN THE WORLD HAS CAUGHT THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT HERE. </p><p>MUDENGE DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT COURSE OF ACTION </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT MIGHT TAKE, SHOULD IT FIND ITSELF AN </p><p>ISOLATED STATE, ALTHOUGH WE SPECULATE THAT IT MIGHT </p><p>ACCELERATE THE ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL FARMS FOR RE- </p><p>SETTLEMENT.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER THROUGH ALL HIS </p><p>BLUSTER HAS MADE A POINT: THE ZANU-PF GOVERNMENT WANTS </p><p>OUR MONEY BUT IS NOT WILLING TO CHANGE ITS WAYS.  AS WE </p><p>DISCUSS POTENTIAL USG INVOLVEMENT IN ASSISTING LAND </p><p>REFORM IN THE FUTURE, WE MUST KEEP THIS POINT IN MIND. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p></div>
