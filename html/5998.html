<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/SA/EX; SA/INS; DS/CIS/PSP; DS/IP/FPO AND </p><p>DS/IP/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, ABLD, AFIN, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: INFORMAL PRESENCE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF </p><p>JAFFNA </p><p> </p><p>1.  With continuing progress toward peace, this Mission </p><p>finds it highly desirable to establish an informal </p><p>presence in the northern city of Jaffna.  This will </p><p>facilitate coordination of AID activities in the areas </p><p>of economic development and humanitarian assistance; </p><p>help us carry out public diplomacy programs; and allow </p><p>us to monitor events/activities important to US foreign </p><p>policy objectives. </p><p> </p><p>2.  To date, Mission personnel on temporary duty to </p><p>Jaffna have had to use the UN guest quarters, which </p><p>still is the only lodging in town.  With UN activities </p><p>increasing rapidly, this option is not available to us </p><p>any longer.  Post therefore plans to lease a residential </p><p>property for lodging by Mission staff during short </p><p>periods of TDY.  While this property will not be used as </p><p>a venue for official meetings, it may be used for </p><p>occasional lunches with contacts. It will have two or </p><p>three bedrooms, kitchen facilities, etc.  It will also </p><p>have a telephone, fax, TV, radio and a PC.  Total </p><p>leasing cost and operating expenses such as salary for a </p><p>cook cum caretaker/ gardener in addition to utilities </p><p>would be about $3,500 per year, which would be funded by </p><p>ICASS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Mission will look at renting an appropriately </p><p>secure residence.  When a property is located, RSO will </p><p>conduct a detailed security inspection of the residence </p><p>and approve or veto its addition to our housing pool. </p><p>Residential security upgrades will be identified and </p><p>reported, and the residence will meet all residential </p><p>security standards prior to occupancy. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Post requests the Department\'s prompt approval and </p><p>funding for this initiative. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
