PROFESSOR </p><p>STEIN\'S DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SUBJECT WAS IMPRESSIVE. </p><p>HE PROVED TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRESENTER WHO SPOKE FLUENTLY </p><p>AND AT LENGTH WITHOUT NOTES.

HE EFFECTIVELY DEMOLISHED </p><p>PATENTLY FALSE EXPLANATIONS OF U.S. PURPOSES (SUCH AS </p><p>THOSE THAT ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET USG ACTIONS AS EFFORTS </p><p>TO SEIZE THE OIL RESOURCES OF IRAQ OR TO REDRAW THE MAP </p><p>OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN FAVOR OF ISRAEL) AND ARTICULATELY </p><p>LAID OUT THE TRUE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF U.S. POLICY (TO </p><p>ELIMINATE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND PREVENT THEM </p><p>FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS). HE WAS NOT </p><p>ALWAYS UNCRITICAL OF USG POLICY, BUT HE WAS FAIR AND EVEN- </p><p>HANDED IN HIS PRESENTATIONS. HE THUS WAS ABLE TO WIN THE </p><p>ATTENTION, RESPECT, AND UNDERSTANDING OF HIS AUDIENCES IN </p><p>A WAY THAT AN OFFICIAL USG SPOKESPERSON MIGHT NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>4.
