<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON), Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  REACTIONS TO KING\'S ASSUMPTION OF </p><p>EXECUTIVE POWERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1932 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  After initially denouncing King Gyanendra\'s October </p><p>4 assumption of executive power (Ref A) as unconstitutional, </p><p>leaders of most political parties are still coming to grips </p><p>with--and trying to assess how best to turn to their </p><p>advantage--the monarch\'s action.  As of COB October 7, most </p><p>party leaders had not yet officially decided whether or how </p><p>to accept Gyanendra\'s invitation to propose members of a </p><p>caretaker government.  A well-connected source with ties </p><p>close to the Palace told the Ambassador October 7 that the </p><p>King is increasingly confident, despite some initial </p><p>demurring, that he will get the multi-partisan support and </p><p>participation in the new Cabinet that he seeks.  Although </p><p>extra police and security have been apparent on Kathmandu </p><p>streets since October 5, public reation remains fairly </p><p>measured--even positive.  Local press and police sources </p><p>report that some former members of Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba\'s Cabinet are under unofficial "house arrest." </p><p>The Maoists, whom the King did not specifically invite to </p><p>participate in the Cabinet, issued a press statement October </p><p>5 condemning the monarch\'s move.  Embassy\'s press statement, </p><p>to be released on an if-asked basis, follows in Para 8 below. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>CONSULTATION, BUT SO FAR NO CONSENSUS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Following his late-night dismissal of the government </p><p>of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his assumption of </p><p>executive powers October 4 (Ref A), King Gyanendra continues </p><p>to meet with leaders of mainstream political parties to </p><p>encourage their participation in a caretaker government. </p><p>Although many of the parties have toned down the heated </p><p>rhetoric of their initial reactions (both factions of the </p><p>Nepali Congress had earlier termed the move "undemocratic" </p><p>and "unconstitutional"), most mainstream parties were as of </p><p>COB October 7 still assessing the King\'s action--and his </p><p>invitation to nominate members to an interim Cabinet.  Sushil </p><p>Koirala, General Secretary of the Nepali Congress (Koirala </p><p>wing), told us that his party had many questions about the </p><p>"modalities" of the proposed new government, i.e., whether </p><p>the Cabinet could be reconstituted from the previous </p><p>Parliament; whether the Cabinet or the King will exercise </p><p>executive powers; and the extent of powers of the caretaker </p><p>Prime Minister.  Both the National Democratic Party, which </p><p>had initially welcomed the King\'s action, and the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) have not yet </p><p>determined whether to accept the King\'s offer and nominate </p><p>members to join the interim government.  Only former Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba told the Ambassador on October 7 that he will </p><p>not forward to the King nominations for the proposed interim </p><p>government (septel). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Former Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, now allied </p><p>with the Nepali Congress (Koirala), told the Ambassador </p><p>October 7 that his party, while still regarding the King\'s </p><p>action as unconstitutional, realizes it must deal with the </p><p>new reality the move presents.  The Nepali Congress is very </p><p>concerned that "no further encroachment" upon the </p><p>Constitution take place.  The new Cabinet should include </p><p>members of political parties based on their representation in </p><p>the previous Parliament, Mahat said.  Indeed, most of the </p><p>Cabinet should be political figures, rather than technocrats, </p><p>Mahat noted, citing Article 128 of the Constitution.  (Note: </p><p>Article 128.2 stipulates that in the event of the dissolution </p><p>of the Cabinet, "His Majesty shall constitute a new Council </p><p>of Ministers consisting of representatives from the main </p><p>political parties."  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The parties\' apparent hesitation does not seem to be </p><p>a matter of concern to the King.  Prabhakar Rana, a prominent </p><p>businessman with close ties to the Palace, told the </p><p>Ambassador October 7 that King Gyanendra is increasingly </p><p>confident that he will get the multi-partisan support and </p><p>participation he is seeking within the five-day limit he set </p><p>in his October 4 speech (Ref A).  The King is not bargaining </p><p>with the parties, Rana asserted, although he indicated the </p><p>monarch may be reconsidering his precondition that new </p><p>Cabinet members not stand in the next general election.  Rana </p><p>also dismissed speculation that the King plans to fill the </p><p>new interim government with aged hold-overs from the former </p><p>Panchayat regime. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Although police and security forces have beefed up </p><p>their presence along Kathmandu streets since October 5, </p><p>public reaction to the King\'s announcement has been </p><p>comparatively calm--even positive.  The Palace declared </p><p>October 7 a government holiday; most people took the occasion </p><p>to shop in preparation for the week-long Dasain holiday, </p><p>which begins October 14.  The UML student union staged a </p><p>peaceful protest October 6; other public demonstrations have </p><p>been pro-Palace.  Members of the business community have told </p><p>us they welcomed the King\'s move--some even going so far as </p><p>to take out public advertisements applauding his action in </p><p>local newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) According to police sources, at least two of former </p><p>PM Deuba\'s Cabinet Ministers have been placed under </p><p>unofficial house arrest.  Police are "guarding" the private </p><p>homes of former Communications Minister Jaya Prakash Gupta </p><p>and former Physical Works Minister Chiranjibi Wagle, both of </p><p>whom have been summoned to appear before the Commission for </p><p>the Investigation into the Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the </p><p>autonomous anti-corruption body.  The police have told us </p><p>that the order was passed down from sources in the Palace, </p><p>rather than the Home Ministry.  There have been unconfirmed </p><p>press reports that the homes of three other former </p><p>ministers--Khum Bahadur Khadga (Home), Bal Bahadur K.C. </p><p>(Civil Aviation), and Bijay Kumar Gachhadar (Water Resources) </p><p>are under police surveillance as well.  Reflective of the </p><p>many problems that he had with his erstwhile Cabinet </p><p>colleagues, former Prime Minister Deuba told the Ambassador </p><p>that he had "no problem if they were thrown in jail." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>MAOISTS:  PREDICTABLE CONDEMNATION, BUT SO FAR NO ACTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  On October 5 Maoist leader Prachanda issued a press </p><p>statement condemning Gyanendra\'s action as a "baton" to </p><p>"attack the fundamental rights of the people," part of an </p><p>ongoing Palace conspiracy to undermine democracy.  Noting </p><p>that the King\'s announcement made no mention of a solution to </p><p>the "present civil war in the country," the Maoist statement </p><p>urges all Nepalis to "launch a strong protest to sweep out </p><p>the feudal, tyrannical despots forever."  Despite the fiery </p><p>rhetoric, however, there have been no reports of increased </p><p>Maoist activity or fresh schedules for general strikes, or </p><p>"bandhs," issued since the King\'s October 4 speech. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>EMBASSY STATEMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The Foreign Ministries in New Delhi and Beijing have </p><p>already issued public statements regarding the King\'s action: </p><p> China\'s predictably non-committal and India\'s well-balanced </p><p>and generally supportive.  We understand the EU may be </p><p>weighing a joint statement. The Embassy prepared the </p><p>following statement to be used on an if-asked basis with the </p><p>Nepali and foreign press. </p><p> </p><p>--We consider it regrettable that the security situation </p><p>prevented elections from being held as scheduled on November </p><p>13. </p><p> </p><p>--As friends of Nepal, we view preservation of the </p><p>constitutional monarchy and a multi-party democracy that </p><p>respects all fundamental political and civil rights as </p><p>crucial elements of any satisfactory resolution to this </p><p>national crisis. </p><p>--We note His Majesty\'s affirmation of his commitment to the </p><p>Constitution and democracy. </p><p> </p><p>--We consider it imperative that free, fair and credible </p><p>national and local elections be held as soon as feasible. </p><p> </p><p>--In this time of national crisis, we look to all Nepalis to </p><p>accept the challenge before their country and contribute </p><p>their vision and leadership to resolve the problems </p><p>confronting their nation. </p><p> </p><p>End statement. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) After initially condemning the King\'s move as </p><p>unconstitutional, the largest political parties are clearly </p><p>re-thinking their positions.  With the possible exception of </p><p>former PM Deuba\'s Nepali Congress (Democratic), most parties </p><p>seem to be reassessing their options and attempting to </p><p>extract the most advantage possible from the new situation. </p><p>The composition of the new Cabinet is very much a work in </p><p>progress for both the King and the parties.  Despite the </p><p>tough talk on both sides, we expect a signficant amount of </p><p>accommodation will take place on the part of both the Palace </p><p>and the parties in order to achieve a workable solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
