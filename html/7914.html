<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 002236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE LEADERSHIP RESPONDS TO AMBASSADOR\'S URGING OF </p><p> </p><p>REFORM AT CONTROVERSIAL UAEG-FUNDED ZAYID CENTER </p><p>FOR COORDINATION AND FOLLOW-UP </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 Abu Dhabi 4712 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  As a result of the Ambassador\'s </p><p>interventions with the UAE leadership, the Zayid </p><p>Center for Coordination and Follow-up (ZCCF), a </p><p>UAEG-funded institution which has drawn fire for </p><p>its sometimes noxious and intolerant views, is set </p><p>to be placed under new management.  This will be </p><p>welcome news to many in the United States who have </p><p>grown alarmed over the ZCCF\'s embrace of hateful </p><p>rhetoric, its publication of virulently anti- </p><p>Semitic literature and its promotion of fringe </p><p>speakers, who while billed as "researchers" or </p><p>"experts," frequently pander to the lowest common </p><p>denominator\'s taste for base racism and conspiracy </p><p>theories.  In a May 6 meeting, MFA Minstate Hamdan </p><p>told the Ambassador that as a result of her </p><p>expressions of concern -- including a two-page </p><p>letter outlining our serious reservations with the </p><p>ZCCF\'s policies -- Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Khalifa </p><p>will soon shift supervision of the ZCCF from its </p><p>current sponsor to the highly respected Center for </p><p>Documentation and Research, which is attached to </p><p>the office of President Zayid.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S DIALOGUE WITH MFA MINSTATE ON </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL ZCCF BOOKS AND SPEAKERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In 2002, the Ambassador began a quiet </p><p>dialogue with MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid in </p><p>which she voiced concerns about the controversial </p><p>Zayid Center for Coordination & Follow-up (ZCCF). </p><p>By way of background, the Center was established by </p><p>a decree from the UAE cabinet in 1997 and reports </p><p>to both the UAE Government and the Arab League, </p><p>though it is funded entirely by the Emirate of Abu </p><p>Dhabi.  The brain child of UAE Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Shaykh Zayid\'s second eldest son, the </p><p>often erratic and sometimes bibulous Sultan bin </p><p>Zayid, the ZCCF in its formative years attracted </p><p>many prominent speakers, including former President </p><p>Jimmy Carter, former VP Al Gore and former </p><p>Secretary of State James Baker.  However, over the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>last 18 months, and particularly since the 9/11 </p><p>terror attacks, the ZCCF has adopted an especially </p><p>harsh tone, often crossing the line into anti- </p><p>Semitism. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>TROUBLED CENTER REFLECTS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR OF </p><p>PATRON SHAYKH SULTAN BIN ZAYID </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We reported last year (reftel) on the ZCCF\'s </p><p>increasingly regrettable choice of speakers, </p><p>commenting that it seemed to reflect the spotty </p><p>behavior of its patron, Sultan bin Zayid, who has </p><p>been known to lash out publicly against the U.S., </p><p>absent coordination with other UAEG policymakers. </p><p>Sultan reportedly had difficulty believing that the </p><p>9/11 attacks were perpetrated by Arabs and by early </p><p>2002, had withdrawn almost completely from public </p><p>life and resumed his addiction to alcohol and </p><p>drugs.  Among the more questionable speakers hosted </p><p>by the ZCCF at the time was fabled French </p><p>"intellectual" Thierry Meyssoun who told a packed </p><p>audience that the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by </p><p>the CIA/FBI.  In the summer of 2002, the ZCCF </p><p>sponsored a conference on "semitism" during which </p><p>remarks attributed to Center employees and speakers </p><p>denying the Holocaust were picked up by the </p><p>international press and became a source of alarm to </p><p>American Jewish organizations.  Attention was drawn </p><p>to the ZCCF\'s publication of books such as "The </p><p>Zionist Movement and its Animosity to Jews" and "Al </p><p>Buraq Wall, Not Wailing Wall." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>AMBASSADOR PRESSES HAMDAN TO SHUT DOWN WEBSITE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Not long after Meyssoun took the podium at </p><p>the ZCCF, the Ambassador approached Hamdan and told </p><p>him that the Embassy had decided not to recommend </p><p>the Center to visiting officials (both current and </p><p>former) and American academics.  The British </p><p>Embassy told us they had similarly decided against </p><p>recommending the ZCCF.  Hamdan readily acknowledged </p><p>that the ZCCF had become a source of embarrassment </p><p>to the UAEG and noted the irony that an institution </p><p>bearing his father\'s name was entirely against </p><p>Zayid\'s longstanding policy of tolerance and </p><p>respect for different faiths. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Last month, the Embassy\'s Public Affairs </p><p>Office received an inquiry from the Divinity School </p><p>at Harvard University.  Harvard\'s acceptance of a </p><p>generous gift from Shaykh Zayid to establish a </p><p>chair for Islamic Religious Studies had come under </p><p>fire from faculty members and students because of </p><p>the ZCCF\'s promotion of intolerant, noxious and </p><p>racist views, particularly on the Center\'s website. </p><p>Harvard queried us on whether the ZCCF was UAEG- </p><p>funded.  We responded that while the institution is </p><p>funded by the UAEG, it does not necessarily reflect </p><p>the views of the UAEG or Shaykh Zayid personally. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador informed Shaykh Hamdan of </p><p>Harvard\'s inquiry and again pressed him to take </p><p>action soon before Harvard felt compelled to reject </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s offer of a chair.  She suggested </p><p>cleaning up the website and changing the Center\'s </p><p>name (i.e. removing Zayid\'s name) would be a good </p><p>first step.  Hamdan was visibly angered that the </p><p>ZCCF\'s antics had forced Harvard to reconsider the </p><p>acceptance of the endowment and at the damage this </p><p>would do to Shaykh Zayid\'s reputation.  Hamdan </p><p>promised to take the issue directly to Abu Dhabi </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayid.  The Ambassador </p><p>followed-up with a formal letter to Hamdan </p><p>outlining our concerns about the ZCCF and noting </p><p>that "a brief overview of the Center\'s website </p><p>reveals the use of inflammatory language, a </p><p>negative focus on Judaism, a blurring of the </p><p>distinction between the Jewish faith, Zionism and </p><p>the Israeli government, as well as the employment </p><p>of classic anti-Semitic terminology."   She </p><p>commented that while "we know the Center does not </p><p>reflect the view of Shaykh Zayid or the Government, </p><p>that distinction is neither understood nor </p><p>appreciated by many in the United States.  Indeed, </p><p>many in the U.S. take the view that if a government </p><p>wholly funds an organization, that government is </p><p>responsible for the organization\'s behavior." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>HAMDAN:  CENTER WILL BE PLACED UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On May 6, Hamdan told the Ambassador that </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa had agreed that the ZCCF was a </p><p>source of embarrassment and had decreed that quick </p><p>action should be taken.  Hamdan said the ZCCF would </p><p>soon be moved from under Sultan\'s sponsorship to </p><p>the highly respected Center for Documentation and </p><p>Research, which is attached to the President\'s </p><p>Office and is under the overall supervision of </p><p>Zayid\'s office director, Mansour bin Zayid.  A ZCCF </p><p>employee told us later that day that orders had </p><p>already been given "from the UAEG leadership" to </p><p>remove all anti-Semitic material from the Center\'s </p><p>website. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment:  It is regrettable that the ZCCF </p><p>has tarnished the name and reputation of Shaykh </p><p>Zayid, a leader whose tenure has seen the </p><p>integration into the UAE of individuals from scores </p><p>of different nationalities and faiths.  Zayid has </p><p>prided himself on having fostered the UAE\'s </p><p>tolerance and openness.  It is heartening to see </p><p>that the leadership is now moving decisively to </p><p>correct the damage done by the ZCCF.  We will </p><p>continue to track this issue closely to assure that </p><p>the current momentum does not flag.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
