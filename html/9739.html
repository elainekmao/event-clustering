ZAKHEIM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 07/18/13 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MASS, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIFT AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF POLISH </p><p>STABILIZATION FORCES IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 210590 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Ambassador asked UAE Chief of Staff LT. </p><p>General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed (MBZ) whether the </p><p>UAE would be able to provide continued "lift" in </p><p>support of Iraqi stabilization efforts. MBZ said </p><p>that they could not commit, at this time, to </p><p>additional support beyond the current operation. </p><p>The Ambassador pointed out that, in six months, </p><p>forces would rotate out without equipment.  He took </p><p>the information on board but did not commit the </p><p>UAEG to any further support, and told the </p><p>Ambassador they would discuss the matter again in </p><p>the fall. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  The air and sealift support that </p><p>the UAEG provided to the Bulgarians took far more </p><p>resources from both the UAEG and the mission than </p><p>anyone originally anticipated.  UAEG airlift and </p><p>sealift assets did not match our requirements for </p><p>the task.  As a result, the UAEG needed to charter </p><p>at least 3 aircraft and one ship so far to meet its </p><p>commitments.  We understand that it will need to </p><p>charter additional aircraft to lift the main body. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Comment Continued:  In addition, the </p><p>coordination effort needed between the USG, the </p><p>UAEG, and the third country was a major task for </p><p>our USLO office here.  In fact, USLO sent one </p><p>officer to Bulgaria with the UAEG in order to </p><p>ensure everything went smoothly.  It was a very </p><p>successful operation, but the financial and human </p><p>resources expended by all sides were considerable. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
