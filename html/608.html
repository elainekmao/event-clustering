<p>UNCLAS VIENNA 006520 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL CSCE AND UNVIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, TU, AU </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE KURDISH PKK IN AUSTRIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  FOR SEVERAL YEARS MEMBERS OF THE KURDISH </p><p>COMMUNITY IN VIENNA HAVE REGULARLY HELD EVENTS TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THEIR CAUSE TO THE MEDIA.  RADICAL GROUPS SUCH </p><p>AS THE PKK, THE TURKISH COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY LEFT OPERATE CLUBS IN VIENNA.  INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY SOURCES SAY AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO </p><p>MONITOR ACTIVISTS OF KURDISH LEFT-WING GROUPS CLOSELY, BUT </p><p>NO BAN OF THE PKK IS PLANNED.  OF THE TURKISH COMMUNITY </p><p>(119,000) IN AUSTRIA, THE MAJORITY ARE BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>KURDS.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA SAID </p><p>HE EXPECTED MORE BOMB ATTACKS AGAINST TOURIST CENTERS IN </p><p>TURKEY "ANY TIME SOON."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  OVER SEVERAL YEARS, KURDISH ACTIVISTS IN VIENNA </p><p>ALTERNATELY SELECTED HIGH VISIBILITY LOCATIONS SUCH AS THE </p><p>NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE AUSTRIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT </p><p>PARTY (SPO), THE VIENNA OFFICES OF LUFTHANSA AND TURKISH </p><p>AIRLINES, THE OFFICE OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, THE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL TV NETWORK ORF, AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS CENTER AT THE UN IN VIENNA TO STAGE </p><p>PROTESTS.  IN MARCH 1988 KURDISH PROTESTERS TRIED TO STORM </p><p>THE IRAQI EMBASSY IN VIENNA.  SIXTY-FOUR DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>WERE BRIEFLY ARRESTED.  IN AUGUST AND OCTOBER OF 1991 </p><p>KURDISH ACTIVISTS OCCUPIED VIENNA\'S ST. STEPHEN\'S </p><p>CATHEDRAL -- THE CITY\'S MAJOR LANDMARK -- TO PROTEST </p><p>"SUPPRESSION OF KURDS IN TURKEY AND IRAQ."  THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION ENDED PEACEFULLY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE TOLD THE EMBASSY JUNE 29 </p><p>THAT SEVERAL REGISTERED TURKISH CLUBS EXISTED IN AUSTRIA </p><p>-- MOST OF THEM IN VIENNA.  A MAJORITY ARE BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>PKK SYMPATHIZERS.  OTHER KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS ARE </p><p>DOMINATED BY ACTIVISTS SUBSCRIBING TO THE TURKISH </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY (TKP) OR THE DEVRIMCI SOL (REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>LEFT).  THEY TOO, RUN CLUBS IN VIENNA, ALL OF WHICH ARE </p><p>REGISTERED WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY SOURCE, AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES </p><p>WATCH ACTIVITIES BY ALL THESE EXTREME LEFT GROUPS </p><p>CLOSELY.  AUSTRIA\'S LAW ON ASSOCIATION -- WHICH REQUIRES A </p><p>GROUP TO REPORT TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ANY EVENT, </p><p>GATHERING OR ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY -- PROVIDES A GOOD </p><p>LEGAL BASE FOR MONITORING THESE GROUPS.  SINCE THE PKK IS </p><p>NOT REGISTERED AS A POLITICAL GROUP IN AUSTRIA, ANY DEBATE </p><p>ABOUT BANNING THE PKK AS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE PKK HAS REGULARLY PARTICIPATED AT THE ANNUAL MAY 1 </p><p>PARADE IN DOWNTOWN VIENNA.  UNTIL A YEAR AGO, PKK </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS WOULD CARRY PICTURES SHOWING STALIN.  THIS </p><p>YEAR THESE PICTURES WERE REPLACED BY PHOTOS OF ABIMAEL </p><p>GUZMAN, HEAD OF PERU\'S SHINING PATH GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AN OFFICIAL AT THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA, BRUNO </p><p>BILEK, IS QUOTED IN THE VIENNA DAILY "KURIER" SAYING THE </p><p>SITUATION IN TURKEY AFTER THE RECENT BOMB ATTACK ON A </p><p>TOURIST HOTEL WAS "VERY GRAVE."  THE EMBASSY WAS AWARE OF </p><p>TERRORIST THREATS AGAINST TOURISTS IN VACATION AREAS ON </p><p>THE AEGEAN SEA AS WELL AS IN CAPPADOCIA.  HE IS QUOTED AS </p><p>SAYING HE EXPECTS ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK "ANY TIME </p><p>SOON."  SINCE TURKEY IS A POPULAR VACATION DESTINATION FOR </p><p>AUSTRIANS, AND SINCE JULY AND AUGUST ARE MAJOR VACATION </p><p>PERIODS IN AUSTRIA, THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A TERRORIST </p><p>THREAT TO TOURISTS IN TURKEY BY A GOA OFFICIAL IS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT, EVEN IF THE GOA IS NOT ISSUING A TRAVEL </p><p>ADVISORY.  THE GOA MAINTAINS A HIGH LEVEL OF VISIBLE </p><p>SECURITY PRESENCE AT THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN VIENNA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWIHART </p><p></p></div>
