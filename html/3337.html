<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001664 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE FINANCE MINISTER PROVIDES STARK ECONOMIC </p><p>PICTURE IN LETTER TO CABINET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a June 25 letter to the Cabinet\'s economic and </p><p>finance committe, Finance Minister Simba Makoni provided a </p><p>stark picture of Zimbabwe\'s economic crisis.  According to </p><p>Makoni, Zimbabwe has no foreign exchange reserves, which has </p><p>prevented the Government from procuring even those products </p><p>it has identified as most critical -- drugs, fuel, </p><p>electricity, and grain -- and paying even its most </p><p>understanding creditors (Zimbabwe\'s  external arrears now </p><p>total U.S. $1.36 billion.)  HCB Mozambique has recently </p><p>reduced electricity supplies due to non-payment and ESKOM </p><p>South Africa has designated Zimbabwe an "interruptible" </p><p>customer.  Payments are also long overdue to fuel suppliers; </p><p>more than a third of the GOZ\'s U.S. $106 million debt in the </p><p>fuel sector is owed to the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, but </p><p>funds are not available to meet that commitment.  The GOZ can </p><p>no longer afford to buy sufficient quanitities of chemicals </p><p>for treatment of drinking water, posing a major public health </p><p>hazard, and it is unable to cover the costs of its diplomatic </p><p>missions overseas.  A major shortfall -- estimated to be U.S. </p><p>$1.15 billion -- in forex requirements between now and March </p><p>2003 will result in either critical shortages of essential </p><p>inputs or further build up in external arrears.  The fact </p><p>that we have a copy of Makoni\'s letter should be strictly </p><p>protected, as it was an internal document not intended for </p><p>circulation outside of Cabinet.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>General economic indicators </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 17, a reliable embassy contact with excellent </p><p>sources in the Zimbabwean government provided us with a copy </p><p>of a private June 25 letter from Finance Minister Simba </p><p>Makoni to the Cabinet committee on financial and economic </p><p>affairs.  The letter provides a stark assessment of the </p><p>country\'s economic crisis, and describes in some detail the </p><p>GOZ\'s spending priorities, arrearages to key creditors, and </p><p>financial arrangements with Libya.  We have summarized key </p><p>excerpts in this cable and have forwarded the letter by </p><p>classified pouch to AF/S. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Excerpts from Minister Makoni\'s letter: </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Zimbabwe "has no usable foreign exchange reserves," </p><p>which has adversely affected the country\'s ability to procure </p><p>critical imports such as drugs, fuel, electricity, raw </p><p>materials, and grain.  In addition, Zimbabwe has failed to </p><p>meet its foreign payment obligations "resulting in the </p><p>suspension of disbursements of critical project-related </p><p>loans, thus worsening the balance of payments position."  As </p><p>of mid-June, Zimbabwe\'s total external payment arrears were </p><p>U.S. $1.36 billion. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A GOZ External Payments Committee (EPC) earlier </p><p>decided to allocate scarce resources to certain critical </p><p>sectors of the economy, but the GOZ does not have even </p><p>sufficient funds for these top priority areas: </p><p> </p><p>--grain, fuel, electricity, drugs, and currency swaps; </p><p>--creditors likely to disburse funds quickly, such as the </p><p>Kuwait Fund and Badea; </p><p>--multilateral institutions; </p><p>--overseas embassies and critical CPO payments (PFMS and </p><p>Security); </p><p>--water treatment chemicals </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Electricity debts </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) owes </p><p>its electricity suppliers U.S. $21 million and spare parts </p><p>suppliers U.S. $7.4 million.  ZESA\'s monthly foreign currency </p><p>requirements average U.S. $12 million, but the GOZ has only </p><p>been able to allocate a monthly average of U.S. $5.3 million </p><p>since January, leaving a significant shortfall.  ZESA\'s </p><p>principal creditors in this sector are </p><p>ESKOM (S. Africa), owed U.S. $5.07 million since 6/14/02; HCB </p><p>(Mozambique), owed U.S. $6.67 million since 4/30/02; EDM </p><p>(Mozambique), owed U.S. $4.14 million for wheeling charges </p><p>since 4/30/02; SNEL (DRC), owed U.S. $4.15 million since </p><p>2000; and ZESCO (Zambia), owed U.S. $1.09 million since 2000. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HCB Mozambique has decided to reduce electricity </p><p>supplies to ZESA effective 6/30/02 due to non-payment, while </p><p>ESKOM has made ZESA an "interruptible" customer, meaning its </p><p>supplies can be reduced at any time.  Meanwhile, SNEL DRC </p><p>has, since April 2002, demanded payment in hard currency. </p><p> </p><p>Fuel debts </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) is in </p><p>arrears to the tune of U.S. $106 million, and payments are </p><p>long overdue.  NOCZIM\'s largest creditor, by far, is the </p><p>Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, which was owed U.S. $43 million as </p><p>of June 22, but  funds are not available to meet this </p><p>commitment.  Other major creditors are BP South Africa (owed </p><p>U.S. $17.8 million since 1999); IPG (owed U.S. $17.8 million </p><p>since 2000); Engen South Africa (owed U.S. $12 million since </p><p>1999); Caltex (owed U.S. $7.8 million since 1999); the </p><p>Government of Botswana (owed U.S. $4.4 million since 2000); </p><p>and Mobil Africa (owed U.S. $1.1 million since 1999). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The GOZ\'s agreement with the Libyan Area Foreign </p><p>Bank provides for NOCZIM to deposit the Zimbabwe dollar </p><p>equivalent of oil supplied in an account at the Commercial </p><p>Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ).  The funds in that account are then </p><p>used by the Libyan authorities to make investments in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  The only investments made so far, however, have </p><p>been the purchase of Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe shares worth </p><p>U.S. $6.7 million.  When Zimbabwe was unable to settle its </p><p>debt of U.S. $43 million on June 22, Tamoil suspended all </p><p>deliveries of petroleum products to NOCZIM.  (Note:  we do </p><p>not know whether this debt has subsequently been paid.  End </p><p>note.)  Until that amount is paid, "it would be difficult for </p><p>NOCZIM to negotiate for the renewal of the U.S. $90 million </p><p>Financing Facility through the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank." </p><p>(Note: A separate contact informed us that the GOZ delegation </p><p>that traveled to Tripoli in late June to renegotiate the </p><p>facility encountered a frosty reception.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Air Zimbabwe/Eximbank </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Makoni notes the agreement reached in May among his </p><p>Ministry, the Ministry of Transport and Communication, and </p><p>Air Zimbabwe to repay Eximbank for the airline\'s two Boeing </p><p>767\'s -- U.S. $5 million each in April and May, U.S. $6 </p><p>million each in June, July, and August, and a final U.S. $4.6 </p><p>million payment in September.  Makoni warns that the aircraft </p><p>will be impounded in the event of non-payment, and reports </p><p>that, in apparent anticipation of such action, "creditors" </p><p>have written to the GOZ advising of their intention to send </p><p>inspectors to examine the aircraft. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s embassies </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The GOZ continues to have serious difficulties in </p><p>covering the costs of its overseas diplomatic missions.  A </p><p>U.S.$2 million payment was made in May to cover a portion of </p><p>costs incurred in January, while an additional U.S. $2.1 </p><p>million was disbursed in June to cover a portion of January </p><p>and February costs.  Makoni stresses that "the situation at </p><p>embassies is now very critical and there is urgent need to </p><p>pay another U.S. $4 million." </p><p> </p><p>Medicines/Health </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The GOZ has been unable to fulfill its committment </p><p>to allocate U.S. $2 million every month to import drugs and </p><p>health equipment, due to the forex shortage.   A total of </p><p>only U.S. $3.5 million has been allocated for this purpose </p><p>since January.  The shortage of medicines and health </p><p>equipment has, according to Makoni, "crippled the health </p><p>delivery system." </p><p> </p><p>Cashflow </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Zimbabwe\'s foreign exchange requirements between </p><p>April 2002 and March 2003, according to Makoni, will amount </p><p>to U.S. $1.15 billion, but the supply is expected to be only </p><p>U.S. $486.4 million.  The consequent shortfall of $660 </p><p>million will result in critical shortages of essential inputs </p><p>or further build up in external payment arrears. </p><p> </p><p>External Payment Arrears -- IFI\'s and other key donors </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Zimbabwe continues to accumulate arrears to </p><p>multilateral financial institutions.  As of mid-June, arrears </p><p>to the IMF total U.S. $131.3 million; to the World Bank, U.S. </p><p>$130.9 million; and to the ADB, U.S. $146.3 million.  In </p><p>addition, there are outstanding payments to creditors "likely </p><p>to disburse," such as Badea </p><p>(U.S. $1.5 million for telecommunications), the Kuwait Fund </p><p>(U.S. $500,000 for road improvements); China (U.S. $2.6 </p><p>million for defense); and IFAD (U.S. $2.2 million for </p><p>agricultural assistance). </p><p> </p><p>Impact on the Economy </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Makoni concludes by emphasizing that the </p><p>unavailability of forex has worsened shortages of raw </p><p>materials, machinery and equipment, and chemicals. </p><p>Consequently, production in the key sectors -- agriculture, </p><p>manufacturing, mining, and tourism -- is severely </p><p>constrained, undermining the capacity of the economy to </p><p>generate foreign exchange.  This cycle could be exacerbated </p><p>if fuel and electricity supplies are reduced due to </p><p>non-clearance of arrears.  The forex shortage will increase </p><p>the difficulty of obtaining fertilizers and other </p><p>agricultural inputs, casting doubt on the success of the </p><p>resettlement program.  It will also further constrain service </p><p>delivery in the health sector; shortages of chemicals for </p><p>treating water, for instance, are "already posing a major </p><p>health hazard." </p><p> </p><p>End Excerpts from Makoni letter. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Makoni has provided a sobering picture of the </p><p>devastation wrought by the Mugabe regime\'s harebrained </p><p>economic mismanagement.  The letter confirms that the Finance </p><p>Minister is as frank in private with his ruling party </p><p>colleagues as he is in public.    It also confirms that GOZ </p><p>decision-makers are well aware of the deleterious impact of </p><p>their policies.  Growing realization of the potentially </p><p>catastrophic consequences of the forex shortage could explain </p><p>recent moves by the Reserve Bank to crack down on bureaux de </p><p>change and other legitimate institutions who deal in the </p><p>parallel currency market.  Further aggressive GOZ regulatory </p><p>efforts, however, could force parallel rate cash flows to </p><p>such legitimate institutions into the black market. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Please strictly protect the fact that we have a copy </p><p>of Makoni\'s letter, as it was not intended for circulation </p><p>outside of Cabinet.  In addition, the well-respected Makoni </p><p>is reportedly considered by some of his more moderate ruling </p><p>party colleagues as a successor to Mugabe, but publication of </p><p>the letter\'s contents could be used against him by other -- </p><p>less palatable -- pretenders to the throne. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
