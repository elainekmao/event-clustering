WITH THE NOTABLE  EXCEPTION  OF  THE </p><p>UNITED  STATES,  CANADA  AND  AUSTRALIA,  THERE  WAS  STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT  FOR  A VOLUNTARY CODE OF CONDUCT ON  THE  RIGHT  TO </p><p>FOOD.  THE U.S. STATEMENT WAS WELL RECEIVED, ALTHOUGH CANADA </p><p>LAUNCHED  A VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THE US FARM BILL.  THE  GROUP </p><p>WILL  MEET AGAIN MAY 24 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND POSSIBLY </p><p>AGAIN  IN  EARLY JUNE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON FOOD  SECURITY </p><p>(CFS) RECONVENES ON JUNE 6.

THERE WAS NO  OECD </p><p>CO-CHAIR.   DESPITE EARLIER EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE  NUMBER  OF </p><p>PARTICIPANTS BY REGIONAL GROUPS, IN THE END THE MEETING  WAS </p><p>OPEN-ENDED.  APPROXIMATELY 50 PERMREPS WERE PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOST OF THE TIME WAS SPENT DISCUSSING PROCEDURAL MATTERS </p><p>RATHER THAN EXCHANGING VIEWS AS ORIGINALLY HOPED.  THE GROUP </p><p>AGREED  TO USE THE HEAVILY BRACKETED DRAFT DECLARATION  THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02487  01 OF 02  210856Z </p><p>HAD  BEEN LEFT UNFINISHED BY THE OEWG DURING THE CFS AND FAO </p><p>COUNCIL   MEETINGS  LAST  JUNE.

THE  LATIN  AMERICAN  GROUP (GRULAC)  PRESSED  HARD  TO </p><p>EXAMINE  THE DOCUMENT PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH BUT THE  EU  IN </p><p>PARTICULAR  RESISTED.  THE EU STRESSED THAT IT  WAS  WORKING </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE AGREED AT THE FAO CONFERENCE  LAST </p><p>NOVEMBER,  AND  WOULD  NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE  TEXT  UNTIL </p><p>AFTER  THE  EUROPEAN  REGIONAL GROUP  MEETING  (MAY  28-30). </p><p>AUSTRALIA  ALSO STRONGLY OPPOSED DEVIATING FROM  THE  AGREED </p><p>SCHEDULE, BUT CANADA JOINED THE LATINS IN PRESSING FOR  MORE </p><p>FORMAL  NEGOTIATIONS.   THE  AFGHAN  DELEGATE  PROPOSED   AN </p><p>EXCHANGE  OF POSITION PAPERS AMONG THE REGIONAL GROUPS,  BUT </p><p>MOST  MEMBERS  WERE  NOT READY TO PUT THEIR  POSITIONS  INTO </p><p>WRITING.  THERE SEEMED TO BE GENERAL AGREEMENT, HOWEVER,  ON </p><p>IDENTIFYING AREAS OF CONCERN IN THE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>5.   SEVERAL OF THESE CONCERNS SLOWLY EMERGED.  POLAND ASKED </p><p>HOW  THE CONCEPT OF THE "GLOBAL ALLIANCE" WOULD FIT INTO THE </p><p>DECLARATION  (CURRENTLY  DISCUSSED  IN  AN  ANNEX   TO   THE </p><p>DOCUMENT.)   COMMENT:  WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME (IN  THE  EU) </p><p>HAVE  BEEN  DISCUSSING  SETTING UP A  SMALL  SECRETARIAT  TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT  THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS  UNCLEAR </p><p>WHAT  SUCH  A BODY WOULD DO AND HOW IT WOULD BE FUNDED.  END </p><p>COMMENT.  PERU SAID THE COALITION SHOULD INVOLVE  CSO\'S  AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02487  01 OF 02  210856Z </p><p>NGO\'S. </p><p> </p><p>6.    NORWAY  SUPPORTED  A  RIGHTS-BASED  APPROACH  TO  FOOD </p><p>SECURITY  AND WAS JOINED BY OTHERS CALLING FOR  A  VOLUNTARY </p><p>CODE  OF  CONDUCT (PARAGRAPH 8).  PERU SUPPORTED NORWAY  AND </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS OR  FAO </p><p>WOULD HAVE THE LEAD. </p><p> </p><p>7.   CANADA  EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADE  ISSUES  AND </p><p>SHARPLY  CRITICIZED  U.S. FARM SUBSIDIES  CONTAINED  IN  THE </p><p>RECENTLY  ADOPTED  FARM  BILL.   AUSTRALIA  JOINED  HIM   IN </p><p>CRITICIZING  THE UNITED STATES.  AUSTRALIA ALSO  ASKED  WHAT </p><p>CONCRETE PROGRESS IN REFERENCE TO WSSD MEANT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NEW ZEALAND ASKED WHAT WAS MEANT BY LANGUAGE CALLING FOR </p><p>AN   INCREASED   SHARE  OF  ODA,  LENDING  BY  INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS OF  LDC\'S. </p><p>HE  ALSO SUGGESTED DROPPING ALTOGETHER THE PARAGRAPH ON  THE </p><p>VOLUNTARY  TRUST  FUND,  WHICH  WAS  SO  CONTROVERSIAL  WHEN </p><p>ADOPTED LAST JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>9.   JAPAN  NOTED  THAT  FISHERIES AND FORESTRIES  HAD  BEEN </p><p>OMITTED  AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN NEW LANGUAGE.
