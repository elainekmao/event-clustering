<p>UNCLAS ACCRA 000803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, GH, economy </p><p>SUBJECT: INFLATION CONTINUES TO CREEP UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) statistics </p><p>for March show that strong inflationary pressures continue </p><p>to bedevil the Ghanaian economy.  Most analysts believe the </p><p>GoG/IMF inflation target of 9 percent at the end of 2003 is </p><p>unachievable. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.  Figures released by the GSS showed that prices rose by </p><p>29.9 percent between March 2002 and March 2003, compared to </p><p>the 29.4 for February 2002 to February 2003.  The official </p><p>inflation rate is currently at its highest level since </p><p>September 2001.  The GSS said a 3.3 percent increase in the </p><p>price of food and beverages and a 5.9 percent rise in the </p><p>cost of housing and utilities during March were the main </p><p>contributing factors. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A sharp rise in the inflation rate from 16.3 percent in </p><p>January to 29.4 percent in February generated a lot of </p><p>controversy over the accuracy of the figures.  This delayed </p><p>the Monetary Policy Committee\'s decision on the Bank of </p><p>Ghana\'s prime rate.  The February figure was finally </p><p>accepted, but it was expected to be a one-time increase and </p><p>thought to be the result of "turbulent data" captured during </p><p>the confusion over transport fares after the petroleum </p><p>product price increase in January 2003.  As a result of this </p><p>the MPC cautiously increased the prime rate from 25.5 </p><p>percent to 27.5 percent in March. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Contrary to government expectations, inflation has gone </p><p>up again in March 2003.  Economists believe that inflation </p><p>impulses still persist which makes the disinflation process </p><p>hard to achieve.  The rationalization of petroleum products </p><p>and utilities prices and the transmission lag of money </p><p>supply growth of 50 percent in 2002 are still exerting some </p><p>pressures.   The upward revision of the prime rate has been </p><p>followed by an increase in the lending rates, which may lead </p><p>to some cost-push effects. </p><p> </p><p>5.  To most analysts, the GoG/IMF inflation target of 9 </p><p>percent at the end of 2003 is unachievable.   There are </p><p>expectations that it may slow down in the second half of the </p><p>year but may still remain between 15-20 percent.  It will, </p><p>however, require a great deal of fiscal and monetary </p><p>tightness in order to get there. </p><p> </p><p>Yates </p><p></p></div>
