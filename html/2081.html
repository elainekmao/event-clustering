<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002684 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING WITH OBASANJO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  On October 18, Ambassador Jeter met briefly with </p><p>President Obasanjo and NSA Mohammed to discuss Obasanjo\'s </p><p>upcoming "working visit" to the United States.  Obasanjo said </p><p>the trip would have to be short -- he could not arrive any </p><p>earlier than the morning of November 2 and had to return to </p><p>Nigeria by November 4.  Former President Mandela had invited </p><p>Obasanjo to Burundi on November 1.  Obasanjo had committed to </p><p>go before he knew about the Washington date.  He stated that </p><p>he could not now disappoint Mandela.  On the back end of his </p><p>schedule, he had to return home promptly from the U.S. </p><p>because of the start of his party\'s national convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Despite the long flight from Burundi, Obasanjo stated </p><p>that he would be ready to meet POTUS late in the morning of </p><p>November 2.  Because of his time constraints, Obasanjo will </p><p>not attend the Corporate Council on Africa\'s Philadelphia </p><p>conference; the planned Baltimore speech is apparently also </p><p>of the boards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  However, Obasanjo still is considering a Houston Stop </p><p>on November 3.  In Houston, he would like to see former </p><p>President Bush and probably like to meet senior executives of </p><p>oil and oil service companies and visit with a gathering of </p><p>the Nigerian community in Houston, which likely represents </p><p>the largest concentration of Nigerians in the U.S.  In a pull </p><p>aside after the meeting, Special Presidential Advisor Adobe </p><p>Obe told us that the President might also like to pay a visit </p><p>to Rice University.  The Baker institute was also raised, and </p><p>Adobe asked us to informally approach the Baker Institute to </p><p>ascertain if they would be interested in receiving the </p><p>Nigerian President. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
