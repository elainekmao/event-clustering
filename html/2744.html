<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001821 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AL, EAID, ENRG, IT, PREL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY/ALBANIA - GOI CONDITIONS AID PLEDGE TO GOA: </p><p>"HELP US TO HELP YOU" </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 1393 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01821  111613Z </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U)  ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ON APRIL 9, BALKAN OFFICE HEAD MAURIZIO MASSARI AND </p><p>MFA UNDER SECRETARY ROBERTO ANTONIONE HAD "EXTREMELY </p><p>PRODUCTIVE AND ENCOURAGING" MEETINGS IN TIRANA WITH PRIME </p><p>MINISTER MAJKO, FOREIGN MINISTER DADE, AND ECONOMIC MINISTER </p><p>MEKSI.  MASSARI TOLD POLOFF APRIL 10 THAT THE GOI AND GOA </p><p>RENEWED A PROTOCOL OF COOPERATION, AND THE GOI PLEDGED 202 </p><p>MILLION EUROS IN AID THROUGH 2004 FOR, INTER ALIA, </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT, ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT, AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE.  MOST SIGNIFICANT, SAID MASSARI, WAS 30 MILLION </p><p>EUROS EARMARKED FOR ENERGY, FOLLOWING UP ON A PLEDGE BY PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI TO PM MAJKO DURING THE LATTER\'S VISIT TO ROME LAST </p><p>MONTH (REFTEL).  THE FUNDS WERE TO BE USED TO PURCHASE </p><p>ELECTRICITY TO "KEEP THE LIGHTS ON" FOR THE SHORT TERM, BUT </p><p>ALSO TO BUILD A VIABLE ENERGY GENERATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR </p><p>LONG TERM ENERGY PRODUCTION.  "WE WERE VERY FRANK" WITH THE </p><p>ALBANIANS, SAID MASSARI.  THE GOI EXPECTS THE GOA TO PLAN FOR </p><p>THE FUTURE.  HE SAID THAT ANTONIONE REMINDED THE ALBANIANS </p><p>THAT THE CAUSE OF THEIR ENERGY PROBLEMS WAS "NOT ONLY THE </p><p>WEATHER."  THE GOI WANTS TO SEE ITS AID GO TO PROJECTS THAT </p><p>WILL "CORRECT PAST MISTAKES." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOA IS HEARING A SIMILAR MESSAGE FROM THE EU </p><p>REGARDING OPENING STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION (SAA) </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, SAID MASSARI.  THE GOI\'S VIEW IS THAT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD START BEFORE JUNE.  HOWEVER, ANTONIONE </p><p>REMINDED THE GOA THAT THERE ARE MANY SKEPTICS, IN THE EU AND </p><p>OSCE, WHO QUESTION THE GOA\'S ABILITY AND COMMITMENT TO </p><p>CHANGE, THEREFORE RAPID PROGRESS ON NEEDED REFORMS WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01821  111613Z </p><p>CRITICAL.  MASSARI SAID THE MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED AND </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL THEIR INTERLOCUTORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MASSARI REPEATED THE GOI\'S VIEW (REFTEL) THAT THE IC </p><p>SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE GOA REFORMS TO DATE, SUCH AS OVERALL </p><p>RELATIVE POLITICAL STABILITY, COOPERATION WITH THE GOI IN </p><p>FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND A RECENT BIPARTISAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DECISION TO IMPLEMENT ODIHR ELECTORAL SYSTEM </p><p>REFORMS RECOMMENDATIONS.  POTENTIAL INVESTORS NEED A SIGNAL </p><p>FROM THE IC THAT ALBANIA IS MAKING PROGRESS.  WE HAVE TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESSURE THE GOI TO DO MUCH MORE TO COMBAT </p><p>ORGANIZED CRIME AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, AND IN THE </p><p>GOI\'S VIEW STARTING THE SAA NEGOTIATIONS COULD BE PART OF </p><p>THOSE MEANS.  THE NEGOTIATIONS CAN LAST AS LONG AS NECESSARY, </p><p>AND SERVE AS ANOTHER TOOL TO INFLUENCE GOI ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  MASSARI\'S VIEW IS THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO NOT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THE GOI\'S PROGRESS THUS FAR, AND COULD MAKE IT </p><p>HARDER FOR THE MAJKO GOVERNMENT TO CONVINCE THE ALBANIAN </p><p>PEOPLE THAT ECONOMIC REFORMS, SOMETIMES PAINFUL IN THE SHORT </p><p>TERM, MUST BE ENACTED FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY\'S LONG TERM </p><p>STABILITY.  HE SINGLED OUT THE BRITISH AS AMONG THE MOST </p><p>SKEPTICAL OF ITALY\'S EU PARTNERS REGARDING ALBANIA\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO CHANGE, AND WONDERED IF THE U.S. COULD "PUT IN </p><p>A GOOD WORD" WITH THE BRITS.  HE ALSO REPEATED HIS REQUEST </p><p>FOR A "POSITIVE" U.S. STATEMENT AT THE APRIL 17 FRIENDS OF </p><p>ALBANIA MEETING IN VIENNA.  ACTION REQUEST:  POST WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO GIVE A HEADS-UP TO MASSARI ON THE GENERAL TONE OF OUR </p><p>INTERVENTION IN VIENNA. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01821  111613Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01821 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
