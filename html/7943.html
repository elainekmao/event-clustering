(U) This cable contains an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Deputy Director General For Energy Hakki Akil </p><p>called in Acting DCM May 8 to raise two issues of GOT concern </p><p>related to the stoppage of oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline.  First, Akil said, Turkey\'s Kirikkale Refinery, </p><p>which was designed to process Iraqi crude, was facing a </p><p>serious oil shortage.  Akil said Kirikkale, which was </p><p>supplied entirely by Iraqi crude diverted from the </p><p>Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline (by direct pipeline link to the </p><p>refinery), had not received a shipment in at least two </p><p>months.  He said there had been four shipments of 106,000 </p><p>tons each scheduled from March 14 through the first week of </p><p>May, none of which had been delivered.  Akil noted that </p><p>Kirikkale could process other oil if necessary, but at </p><p>considerable extra cost due to extra operating expenses and </p><p>required technical changes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The second, related issue, Akil said, was the negative </p><p>impact the lack of oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline </p><p>was having on the pipe and the storage tanks at Ceyhan.  Akil </p><p>claimed that Iraq\'s water separation system was inadequate; </p><p>as a result, its oil had four to five percent water content. </p><p>When left sitting in pipes or oil tanks for more than one </p><p>month, this water began to have a corrosive effect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Akil said he understood the U.S. tied the resumption </p><p>of Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil flow to the lifting of sanctions, </p><p>but asked if an exception could be made in this case.  He </p><p>said we could kill two birds with one stone -- the U.S. could </p><p>justify the need to restart the flow in order to prevent </p><p>further corrosion, and Turkey could then supply Kirikkale </p><p>Refinery with Iraqi crude.  Akil said the quantity did not </p><p>have to be great, i.e. the 424,000 tons that had been </p><p>scheduled but not shipped in the previous two months would be </p><p>sufficient.  Akil suggested the profit from this oil could </p><p>even be set aside in a non-U.N. escrow account. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment and action request:  In presenting reftel </p><p>demarche on lifting UN sanctions on Iraq to MFA Deputy U/S </p><p>Kilic (septel), A/DCM noted that the best way for Turkey to </p><p>address this oil problem would be to strongly support our </p><p>proposed UNSC resolution.  Embassy would appreciate any other </p><p>thoughts/guidance Department might have on the MFA\'s inquires. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
