<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 TUNIS 000933 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR G - BISA WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AMGT, EAID, PREL, TS </p><p>SUBJECT:  PEACE CORPS: VIEWS OF AMBASSADORS: TUNIS RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 24652 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PEACE CORPS?  WE LOVED THEM--AND TUNISIA LOVED </p><p>THEM--FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT THE 2,382 AMERICANS AND THEIR THOUSANDS </p><p>OF TUNISIAN COUNTERPARTS MADE DURING THE 34 YEARS OF </p><p>THEIR COMMON ENDEAVOR TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION. </p><p>TUNISIA HAS ATTAINED A LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT THAT </p><p>PRECLUDES OUR CONTINUING TO FUND A PEACE CORPS PROGRAM </p><p>HERE NOW; THE PEACE CORPS FORMALLY LEFT TUNISIA ON </p><p>AUGUST 23, 1996. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FITTED TO THE THREE GUIDELINE QUESTIONS OF REFTEL </p><p>PARAGRAPH 4.ARE SEVERAL EXTRACTS AND PARAPHRASES OF </p><p>SOME OF THE MATERIALS PRESENTED IN THE BROCHURE "PEACE </p><p>CORPS TUNISIA - THE LEGACY - 1962-1996" PREPARED HERE </p><p>(AND IN WASHINGTON) TO COMMEMORATE THE PROGRAM AT THE </p><p>END OF ITS MISSION.  WE HAVE ADDED A FOURTH CATEGORY </p><p>AT THE END OF THIS MESSAGE:  THE CONTRIBUTION FORMER </p><p>PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS BRING HOME WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITEM A.L:  THE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT PEACE </p><p>    CORPS VOLUNTEERS...HAVE PREVIOUSLY MADE: </p><p> </p><p>"TUNISIA WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS INTO ITS NATIONHOOD WHEN </p><p>PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA CAME TO THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>MAY 1961.  AS THE FIRST HEAD OF STATE TO VISIT NEWLY </p><p>ELECTED PRESIDENT KENNEDY, ONE OF THE FIRST ITEMS ON </p><p>BOURGUIBA\'S AGENDA WAS THE PEACE CORPS.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BOURGUIBA HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AND TUNISIA AS </p><p>REFORM-ORIENTED AND FORWARD-MOVING BY PLACING A </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY ON WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, EDUCATION, AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT.  AT THIS FIRST HISTORIC MEETING, BOURGUIBA </p><p>ASKED PRESIDENT KENNEDY FOR AMERICA\'S HELP IN </p><p>FULFILLING THE GOALS OF HIS AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>"TUNISIA BECAME THE FIRST ARAB COUNTRY TO REQUEST AND </p><p>RECEIVE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS.  ENTRY INTO TUNISIA </p><p>WAS GROUND BREAKING AND IT WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR </p><p>PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS TO WORK IN MANY OTHER NATIONS </p><p>OF NORTH AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE ISLAMIC </p><p>WORLD.  MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE IN LANGUAGE TRAINING </p><p>AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING FIRST GAINED IN </p><p>TUNISIA WOULD GO ON TO HELP THE PEACE CORPS PREPARE </p><p>AND TRAIN VOLUNTEERS FOR WORK IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS </p><p>MOROCCO, OMEN, YEMEN, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, UZBEKISTAN, </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN, THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC, AND TURKMENISTAN." </p><p> </p><p>4.  PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS ASSIGNED TO TUNISIA HAD </p><p>TASKS AS VARIED AS ANY IN THE WORLD.  THE INITIAL </p><p>GROUPS OF PCVS IN TUNIS INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>--  ARCHITECTS, TOWN PLANNERS, AND CITY SUPERVISORS, </p><p>    WHO WORKED ON THE COASTAL TOWNS OF SOUSSE AND </p><p>    MONASTIR; </p><p> </p><p>--  JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS, WHO </p><p>    TAUGHT MORE THAN 50,000 TUNISIAN STUDENTS IN THE </p><p>    FOLLOWING 16 YEARS; </p><p> </p><p>--  YOUTH SPECIALISTS, WHO ADDRESSED NEEDS IN THE </p><p>    FIELDS OF SPORTS, EDUCATION, AND NURSING, </p><p>    INCLUDING ONE WHO WAS APPOINTED ASSISTANT COACH </p><p>    OF THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL TEAM; </p><p>- </p><p>--  HOSPITAL AND CLINIC-BASED NURSES, FOCUSSING ON </p><p>    EDUCATING NEW MOTHERS, FAMILY PLANNING, NUTRITION, </p><p>    HEALTH EDUCATION, WATER AND SANITATION; AND </p><p> </p><p>--  MECHANICS, FISHERIES AND AGRICULTURAL SPECIALISTS, </p><p>    WHO PROVIDED VOCATIONAL TRAINING AT TECHNICAL </p><p>    CENTERS, MARINE FISHERIES, AND TAUGHT FARMING </p><p>    METHODS, BEEKEEPING, AND TREE PLANTING. </p><p> </p><p>IN LATER YEARS, PROGRAMS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>--  ARCHITECTS TEACHING ARCHITECTURE; A SCHOOL OF </p><p>    ARCHITECTURE WAS OPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>    TUNIS; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE GOT EFFORT TO IMPROVE URBAN HOUSING WAS </p><p>    ASSISTED BY THE PC SELF-HELP HOUSING PROJECT; </p><p> </p><p>--  PCVS ENTERED THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CENTER; </p><p>    A SPECIAL OLYMPICS WAS INITIATED; A MODEL TRAINING </p><p>    FACILITY WAS BUILT ON THE ISLAND OF DJERBA--THE </p><p>    FIRST OF ITS KIND; AND </p><p> </p><p>--  VIA THE TUNISIAN NATIONAL SPORTS FEDERATION, YOUTH </p><p>    PCVS RETURNED AND INITIATED A YOUTH PROJECT BASED </p><p>    IN RURAL YOUTH CENTERS; </p><p> </p><p>5.  ITEM A.2.:  EVALUATION OF THE VOLUNTEER\'S </p><p>    CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THERE FOLLOWS THE TEXT OF A LETTER FROM HIS EXCELLENCY </p><p>ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>TUNISIA, DATELINED CARTHAGE, AUGUST 23, 1996. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>      LETTER TO THE PEACE CORPS IN TUNISIA </p><p>      ON THE OCCASION OF THE END OF ITS MISSION </p><p> </p><p>  ON THE OCCASION OF THE END OF YOUR MISSION </p><p>  IN TUNISIA, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO EXTEND </p><p>  TO YOU, IN MY NAME AND ON BEHALF OF THE TUNISIAN </p><p>  PEOPLE, MY CONGRATULATIONS AND SINCERE APPRECIA- </p><p>  TION FOR THE IMPORTANT AND NOBLE SERVICES YOU </p><p>  HAVE PROVIDED DURING YOUR STAY IN TUNISIA, THE </p><p>  LAND OF PEACE AND THE CROSSROAD OF CULTURES AND </p><p>  CIVILIZATIONS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>  SINCE ITS CREATION, THE PEACE CORPS HAS BEEN </p><p>  A GREAT SUCCESS AND HAS ACHIEVED THE NOBLE </p><p>  OBJECTIVES OUTLINED BY PRESIDENT JOHN FITZGERALD </p><p>  KENNEDY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1960\'S.  I AM </p><p>  CONFIDENT THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED, THROUGH YOUR </p><p>  MEETING AND DAILY ACTIVITIES IN THE DIFFERENT </p><p>  REGIONS OF OUR COUNTRY, THE HOSPITALITY, THE </p><p>  OPENNESS AND THE TOLERANCE THAT CHARACTERIZE </p><p>  THE TUNISIAN PEOPLE AND HAVE OBSERVED SOME </p><p>  ASPECTS OF THE RICHNESS OF OUR CIVILIZATION AND </p><p>  INCREASED YOUR COMPREHENSION OF THE HABITS AND </p><p>  THE PARTICULARITIES OF OUR COUNTRY.  THIS WILL </p><p>  CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE TO BRINGING THE TUNISIAN </p><p>  AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLES CLOSER TOGETHER. </p><p>  YOUR NOBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPROVEMENT </p><p>  OF LIVING CONDITIONS IN SEVERAL REGIONS IN </p><p>  TUNISIA, BY THE COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>  PROJECTS, HAVE CERTAINLY ALLOWED YOU TO DEVELOP </p><p>  STRONG TIES AND DEEP RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA AND </p><p>  ITS PEOPLE AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING </p><p>  THE TRADITIONAL RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND </p><p>  COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA AND </p><p>  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>6.   MANY OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO SERVED IN TUNISIA </p><p>CHOSE NOT TO LIMIT THEMSELVES SOLELY TO THE TASK FOR </p><p>WHICH THEY WERE INITIALLY SENT, BUT EXPANDED THEIR </p><p>ENDEAVORS LATERALLY, THEREBY ALSO DEMONSTRATING A </p><p>DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAN HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY BEEN UTILIZED BY THEIR COUNTERPARTS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE BEEKEEPER INVOLVED HIMSELF NOT ONLY IN </p><p>TEACHING THE CARE OF BEES AND INCREASING THE HONEY </p><p>PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO IN DEVELOPING LIP BALM AND OTHER </p><p>BEESWAX BYPRODUCTS INSTEAD OF BURNING OFF THE COMBS IN </p><p>WINTER AS HAD BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY.  HE INVOLVED THE </p><p>KEEPERS IN ORGANIZING THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESSES TO </p><p>MARKET THESE PRODUCTS.  THE VOLUNTEER WHO TAUGHT </p><p>CLOTHING CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER SEWING SKILLS TO A </p><p>GROUP OF 15-20 GIRLS LATER FOUND HERSELF DEVISING </p><p>VISUAL AIDS TO TEACH HER SEMI-LITERATE STUDENTS </p><p>QUALITY CONTROL, BASIC ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, AND </p><p>PURCHASING MATERIALS.  THESE GIRLS THEMSELVES LATER </p><p>FOUND THEMSELVES TEACHERS AND LEARNED TO READ AND </p><p>WRITE. </p><p> </p><p>7.   ITEM B.  RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PCVS IN </p><p>     FURTHERING U.S. INTERESTS IN TUNISIA </p><p> </p><p>PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS INCULCATE AMERICAN SOCIAL </p><p>VALUES, EDUCATIONAL VALUES, THE WORK ETHIC, COMMUNITY </p><p>SERVICE, AND SELF-SACRIFICE IN A WAY THAT OUR OTHER </p><p>AGENCIES\' PROGRAMS ARE RARELY ABLE TO ACHIEVE, AND TO </p><p>A TARGET GROUP OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL IN REGIONS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY RARELY EXPOSED TO DIRECT CONTACT WITH </p><p>AMERICANS OR ANY FOREIGNERS. </p><p> </p><p>8.   ITEM C.  WAYS IN WHICH THE ROLE OF THE PEACE </p><p>     CORPS DIFFERS FROM THE ROLE OF OTHER U.S. </p><p>     GOVERNMENT AGENCIES/PROGRAMS IN TUNISIA </p><p> </p><p>TO PLAGIARIZE THE WORDS OF THE FAMOUS BEER COMMERCIAL, </p><p>THE PEACE CORPS REFRESHES THE PARTS THAT OTHER PROGRAMS </p><p>CANNOT REACH.  WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE SOCIAL </p><p>IMPACT OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM.  UNEXPRESSED NEEDS </p><p>AND HIDDEN LONGINGS MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW HOPE AND </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE PCVS. </p><p>BY WHAT THEY WERE, AS MUCH AS BY WHAT THEY DID, OUR </p><p>VOLUNTEERS DEMONSTRATED AMERICAN IDEALS AND VALUES. </p><p>THAT UNIVERSITY EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN WOULD LIVE IN </p><p>SMALL TOWNS AND ACTUALLY GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY, RATHER </p><p>THAN SEEK A CUSHY SINECURE WITH THE BUREAUCRACY OR A </p><p>FAMILY FIRM, MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN MIND-BOGGLING. </p><p>SHOCKING THOUGH IT WAS IN 1962-64, ONE WOMAN, PLAYING </p><p>WITH HER PCV COLLEAGUES ON A PREVIOUSLY ALL-MALE </p><p>BASKETBALL TEAM, MAY HAVE DONE MORE WITH HER PRESENCE </p><p>AND THE RESPECT HER TEAMMATES SHOWED HER TO ILLUSTRATE </p><p>THE CAPABILITIES OF WOMEN THAN A HUNDRED LECTURES </p><p>ABOUT WOMEN\'S RIGHTS COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.   ITEM D:  THE CONTRIBUTION FORMER PEACE CORPS </p><p>     VOLUNTEERS BRING HOME WITH THEM </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO CONSIDER THE THIRD </p><p>GOAL OF THE PEACE CORPS IN THE SCOPE OF THIS CURRENT </p><p>REQUEST, LET US NOT NEGLECT THE CONTRIBUTION PCVS </p><p>BRING HOME.  MAJOR INTANGIBLE BENEFITS ACCRUE TO US </p><p>FROM THE MULTIGENERATIONAL IMPACT RETURNING PCVS HAVE </p><p>HAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ON THE POLITICAL CULTURE </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>DURING THE NEARLY FOUR DECADES SINCE THE INCEPTION OF </p><p>THE PEACE CORPS, FOREIGN TRAVEL HAS BECOME WIDELY </p><p>AVAILABLE AND INCREASINGLY EASY AND CHEAP.  MILLIONS </p><p>OF AMERICANS HAVE BROUGHT HOME A GLIB AND FACILE </p><p>SURFACE FAMILIARITY WITH THE WORLD THAT IS VASTLY </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM THE PEACE CORPS EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>PCVS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANTLY UNIVERSITY </p><p>EDUCATED YOUNG ADULTS WHO MAY HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED </p><p>OR HAVE BEEN NEARLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF </p><p>ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP A SOPHISTICATED AND FREE CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY.  LIVING WITHOUT A FREE PRESS, A MULTI-PARTY </p><p>POLITICAL STRUCTURE, OR TRADE UNIONS COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>A SALUTARY EYE OPENER.  ON THE OTHER HAND, TO HAVE </p><p>LEARNED, UP CLOSE AND DIRTY (SOMETIMES DANGEROUSLY </p><p>SO), THAT </p><p> </p><p>           "THERE ARE NINE AND NINETY WAYS </p><p>           OF CONSTRUCTING TRIBAL LAYS </p><p>           AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM </p><p>           IS RIGHT" </p><p> </p><p>IS NO MEAN INSIGHT EITHER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  FINALLY, LET\'S NOT FORGET THE CONTINUING ROLE </p><p>FORMER PCVS PLAY IN FOSTERING IMPROVED TIES BETWEEN </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AND THEIR FORMER HOST NATION. </p><p>PCVS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE HELPED THE AMERICAN-TUNISIAN </p><p>FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE </p><p>OF THESE GROUPS IN WASHINGTON.  ALL IN ALL, THE PEACE </p><p>CORPS EXPERIENCE IN TUNISIA WAS WIN-WIN FOR ALL </p><p>CONCERNED. </p><p> </p><p>LITTREL </p><p></p></div>
