<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/FO AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SR AFRICA ADVISER JENDAYII FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: HOW MUCH GIVE IN ZANU-PF OPENNESS TO DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) HARARE 1475 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) HARARE 1491 </p><p>     C. (C) HARARE 1506 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASON 1.5D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Most Zimbabweans appear to have welcomed the signs of </p><p>openness to dialogue reflected in the MDC\'s attendance at </p><p>President Mugabe\'s July 22 speech to parliament (ref A).  MDC </p><p>spokesmen have remained on message about their hopes that the </p><p>gesture would open the way for serious dialogue between the </p><p>parties to address the national crisis, despite the July 22 </p><p>arrest (for several hours) of MDC spokesman Paul Themba-Nyati </p><p>over an MDC caricature of President Mugabe and despite </p><p>impediments posed to registration of some MDC local </p><p>government candidates(ref B).  President Mugabe\'s speech to </p><p>the Parliament(ref C) was relatively restrained, but highly </p><p>unrealistic. Then at a later luncheon speech that day to some </p><p>parliamentarians and others, Mugabe was somewhat more </p><p>explicit about his pleasure that MDC had attended the </p><p>parliamentary session and his hope that ZANU-PF and MDC would </p><p>work together in parliament. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) The state media net also went into overdrive, lauding </p><p>the signs of national reconciliation. Even the usually </p><p>acid-tongued ZANU-PF International Secretary Didymus Mutasa </p><p>said that it would be important for the two parties to work </p><p>together to find an economic way forward.  He did not object </p><p>to the MDC maintaining its lawsuit against the conduct of the </p><p>2002 presidential election, but he called for the MDC to </p><p>secure "from its handlers" the removal of economic sanctions </p><p>against Zimbabwe" and rejected the MDC\'s statement that they </p><p>would seek an honorable exit for President Mugabe.  State </p><p>media on July 24 picked up the theme that the MDC must </p><p>demonstrate its patriotism by securing an end to sanctions </p><p>against Zimbabwe, while Information Minister Jonathan Moyo </p><p>diverted from the mostly conciliatory tone by labeling the </p><p>MDC a "hitherto treasonous party" which must stop "sabotaging </p><p>the economy" and claiming that the public is "tired of MDC </p><p>lies and hallucinations." </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Comment:  It is too early to tell with what sincerity </p><p>ZANU-PF is approaching the putative reconciliation with MDC. </p><p>As a minimum, ZANU-PF wished to secure MDC\'s attendance in </p><p>parliament to provide the show of honor which means so much </p><p>to Mugabe.  The Mugabe Government also wished to alleviate </p><p>some of the pressure it was under from South Africa and </p><p>others to enter into dialogue with the MDC.  ZANU would also </p><p>like MDC to share the responsibility for the economic </p><p>hardships the populace is facing and, ideally, to use their </p><p>international ties to relieve the pressure on Zimbabwe.  At </p><p>this point, we are dubious that ZANU intends to give the MDC </p><p>a genuine share of power or to enter into the sort of </p><p>dialogue which addresses the serious issues of Mugabe\'s </p><p>legitimacy and seeks a consensus formula for addressing the </p><p>issue.  This tentative judgment could change depending on the </p><p>amount of external pressure Mugabe comes under, particularly </p><p>from President Mbeki who has been lionized of late in the </p><p>state media for his advocacy of "African solutions to African </p><p>problems" and alleged resistance to American and British </p><p>impositions.  The rapidly unraveling economic situation will </p><p>also put additional pressures on the GOZ, next when </p><p>Zimbabweans are unable to access the salary deposits made in </p><p>their bank accounts at the end of the month.  (Bankers told </p><p>us yesterday told us they feared that riots could break out </p><p>when the currency shortage hits even harder with the </p><p>increased and unmeetable demand for cash from account holders </p><p>after end-month salary deposits.) </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
