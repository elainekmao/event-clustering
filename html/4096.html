<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, SOCI, VM, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  ORGANIZING THE MASSES:  WOMEN AND YOUTH </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  01 HANOI 2402    B.  HANOI 1199 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  VIETNAMESE "MASS ORGANIZATIONS" FOR WOMEN </p><p>AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY CHANGING THEIR FOCUS AWAY </p><p>FROM BEING ONE-WAY COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA TOOLS TO BECOMING </p><p>MORE DYNAMIC INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02598  01 OF 03  281014Z </p><p>THOSE POPULATIONS AND ENGAGING IN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL </p><p>WORK, OFTEN WITH OUTSIDE DONOR ASSISTANCE.  THEIR CONTINUED </p><p>EXISTENCE DEMONSTRATES BOTH THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S COMPULSION </p><p>TO MONITOR AND CONTROL THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM AND, MORE </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, INSTITUTIONAL RESILIENCE IN ADAPTING TO NEW </p><p>REALITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT </p><p>(VFF), THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) HAS A NETWORK OF </p><p>ABOUT 30 "MASS ORGANIZATIONS" THAT RUN FROM THE NATIONAL </p><p>LEVEL DOWN TO VIRTUALLY EACH VILLAGE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY </p><p>(REF A).  VETERANS, FARMERS, SENIOR CITIZENS, LABORERS, ETC. </p><p>ALL HAVE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH SERVE NOT ONLY TO </p><p>CONVEY CPV POLICY DOWNWARD BUT ALSO IN PRINCIPLE TO PROTECT </p><p>THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THOSE GROUPS AND GIVE THOSE </p><p>POPULATIONS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANNEL THEIR CONCERNS </p><p>UPWARDS.  THESE ORGANIZATIONS ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE </p><p>IN THE SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE 2002 NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTION (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>BIG NUMBERS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  WITH WOMEN REPRESENTING 52% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION </p><p>AND PEOPLE UNDER 25 ALSO MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL </p><p>POPULATION, THE VIETNAM WOMEN\'S UNION (VWU) AND VIETNAM </p><p>YOUTH FEDERATION (VYF) REPRESENT TWO "POWERHOUSE" MASS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  ACCORDING TO VICE PRESIDENT NGUYEN PHUONG </p><p>MINH, TOTAL VWU MEMBERSHIP IS 11 MILLION WOMEN.  (BY </p><p>CONTRAST, TOTAL CPV MEMBERSHIP IS UNDER 3 MILLION.) (NOTE: </p><p>EXCLUDING GIRLS UNDER 18 --THE AGE AT WHICH WOMEN CAN JOIN - </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02598  01 OF 03  281014Z </p><p>- THIS WOULD MEAN THAT ALMOST HALF OF ALL ELIGIBLE WOMEN ARE </p><p>AT LEAST NOMINAL VWU MEMBERS.  END NOTE)  MEMBERSHIP FEES </p><p>ARE NOMINAL -- ABOUT 500 DONG (3 US CENTS) A MONTH. </p><p>SUBSCRIPTION TO THE WEEKLY "VIETNAMESE WOMEN\'S NEWSPAPER" IS </p><p>AN ADDITIONAL 80,000 DONG (UNDER US $6) PER YEAR.  THERE IS </p><p>ALSO A GLOSSY "WOMEN OF VIETNAM IN REVIEW" MAGAZINE IN </p><p>ENGLISH.  (MS. MINH IS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF BOTH </p><p>PUBLICATIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VYFU -- WHICH INCLUDES </p><p>THE HO CHI MINH COMMUNIST YOUTH UNION, THE YOUTH PIONEERS, </p><p>THE VIETNAM ASSOCIATION OF STUDENTS, AND, MOST RECENTLY, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE COUNCIL OF YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS -- ARE A TOTAL OF </p><p>9 MILLION MEMBERS, VYF VICE PRESIDENT TRAN DAC LOI TOLD </p><p>POL/C.  THEIR AGES RANGE FROM 9 (WHEN THEY MAY JOIN THE </p><p>PIONEERS; VIRTUALLY 100 PCT OF STUDENTS DO) TO ABOUT 35, </p><p>WHEN THEY MUST STEP DOWN FROM VYF POSITIONS AND MEMBERSHIPS. </p><p>THE 4 MILLION MEMBER-STRONG HO CHI MINH COMMUNIST YOUTH </p><p>UNION IS USUALLY SEEN AS THE TESTING GROUND FOR WOULD-BE CPV </p><p>MEMBERS; 67,926 YOUTH UNION MEMBERS JOINED THE CPV IN 2001, </p><p>COMPARED TO ONLY 46,000 IN 1996, ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL </p><p>MEDIA.  MEMBERSHIP IN THE HCM YOUTH UNION IS BY WRITTEN </p><p>APPLICATION ONLY, ALONG WITH RECOMMENDATION BY A CURRENT </p><p>MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>WOMEN BRANCHING OUT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  BEFORE THE "DOI MOI" ERA BEGAN IN 1986, THE VWU WAS </p><p>PRIMARILY A MOUTHPIECE TO EXPLAIN CPV DECISIONS AND </p><p>PROPAGANDA LINES TO WOMEN, MS. MINH ADMITTED.  SINCE THEN, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02598  01 OF 03  281014Z </p><p>HOWEVER, VWU HAS ALSO MOVED TO UNDERTAKE A VARIETY OF MORE </p><p>ACTIVIST PROGRAMS, SHE CLAIMED.  FOR EXAMPLE, BEGINNING IN </p><p>1997, THE VWU HAS JOINED WITH THE GVN IN ADDRESSING </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS.  UNDER THE GVN\'S ACTION PLAN FOR </p><p>TRAFFICKING PREVENTION, THE VWU HAS USED ITS WIDESPREAD </p><p>COMMUNITY PRESENCE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS AND TO HELP IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THE </p><p>SUSCEPTIBILITY OF VULNERABLE GROUPS TO TRAFFICKING, AS WELL </p><p>AS TO COOPERATE WITH GVN AGENCIES IN ASSISTING VICTIMS AND </p><p>IN INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING TRAFFICKERS.  MS. MINH </p><p>NOTED VWU RECEIVES SOME FOREIGN NGO FUNDING; ONE PROJECT IN </p><p>QUANG NINH PROVINCE PROVIDES HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT FOR </p><p>WOMEN WHO HAVE RETURNED AFTER HAVING BEEN TRAFFICKED AND/OR </p><p>TRICKED INTO FAKE MARRIAGES IN NEIGHBORING CHINA.  (THE USG, </p><p>WORKING THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION </p><p>AND THE ASIA FOUNDATION, WILL ALSO BE PROVIDING FUNDING FOR </p><p>TRAFFICKING PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED BY PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL </p><p>WOMEN\'S UNIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  POVERTY REDUCTION IS ANOTHER KEY TARGET FOR VWU, </p><p>GIVEN THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MS. MINH.  VWU -- THROUGH ITS LOCAL CHAPTERS -- </p><p>OFFERS MODEST CAPITAL FUNDS AS WELL AS SAVINGS PROGRAMS TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SHE EXPLAINED.

MS. MINH </p><p>SAID THAT VWU "MOTIVATORS" SPREAD THE WORD -- AS WELL AS </p><p>WRITTEN MATERIALS -- ABOUT THE LATTER, AND CLAIMED THAT "IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS, THIS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM."  SHE ADMITTED </p><p>THAT CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES REMAINED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02598  02 OF 03  281014Z </p><p>CONVINCE FARMERS TO LIMIT THEIR FAMILY SIZE TO TWO CHILDREN. </p><p>AS A SPECIAL "INCENTIVE," SHE ADDED, VWU HAS A NETWORK OF </p><p>"CLUBS" FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE LESS THAN THREE CHILDREN.  AN </p><p>EVEN NEWER INTEREST FOR VWU IS PROTECTION OF THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, MS. MINH DESCRIBED, BUT ADMITTED THAT ITS </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THIS AREA WERE STILL NASCENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.
