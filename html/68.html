<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 08792 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, LE, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISRAEL\'S POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL KIMCHE BRIEFED AMBAS- </p><p>SADORS FROM UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND UNIFIL CONTRIBUTOR </p><p>COUNTRIES JUNE 12 ON SOUTHERN LEBANON.  KIMCHE REITERATED </p><p>ISRAELI POLICY IN SOUTHERN LEBANON LEADING UP TO THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL, THEN EMPHASIZED THAT ISRAEL WAS NOW OUT OF </p><p>LEBANON AND, THEREFORE, NO LONGER IN CONTROL.  AS A RE- </p><p>SULT, ALTHOUGH ISRAEL WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL, ISRAEL </p><p>FELT THAT UNIFIL MUST WORK OUT THE PROBLEM OF THE FINNISH </p><p>HOSTAGES WITH THE SLA DIRECTLY.  IF ISRAEL SOUGHT TO </p><p>CONTROL EVENTS AND FORCE LAHAD TO RELEASE THE FINNISH </p><p>SOLDIERS, ISRAEL WOULD, IN EFFECT, BE BACK IN LEBANON. </p><p>THERE WOULD BE NO MORE SLA AND LAHAD WOULD BE FINISHED. </p><p>SEVERAL AMBASSADORS SAID THEIR GOVERNMENTS CONSIDER </p><p>ISRAEL TO REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF THE UNIFIL </p><p>SOLDIERS, AND MADE STRONG STATEMENTS OF PRINCIPLE AGAINST </p><p>THE HOLDING OF HOSTAGES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL DAVID KIMCHE INVITED THE AMBAS- </p><p>SADORS AND CHARGES FROM THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER </p><p>STATES AND THE CONTRIBUTORS TO UNIFIL TO A BRIEFING JUNE </p><p>12 ON ISRAEL\'S POLICY IN SOUTH LEBANON.  THE BRIEFING </p><p>INVITATION WAS STIMULATED BY THE PRESENT CRISIS BETWEEN </p><p>UNIFIL AND THE SOUTH LEBANESE ARMY.  KIMCHE SOUGHT TO </p><p>PLACE THE ISRAELI REACTION TO THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE </p><p>BROAD CONTEXT OF ISRAELI POLICY. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ISRAELI POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON </p><p>-   ---------------------------------- </p><p>KIMCHE OPENED BY NOTING THAT THERE IS A CABINET DECISION </p><p>ON SOUTHERN LEBANON THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE BASIS OF </p><p>ISRAELI ACTIONS, UNTIL THERE IS A CABINET DECISION TO </p><p>CHANGE IT.  THE DECISION INCLUDES THE  FOLLOW- </p><p>ING ELEMENTS:  A) THE IDF IS REDEPLOYED ALONG THE INTER- </p><p>NATIONAL FRONTIER, AND NO IDF UNITS WILL REMAIN IN </p><p>LEBANON ON A REGULAR OR PERMANENT BASIS.  B) THE IDF RE- </p><p>TAINS FREEDOM OF ACTION AGAINST TERRORISTS BEFORE, DURING </p><p>OR AFTER THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST ISRAEL.  C)  A SECURITY </p><p>ZONE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, WITH ISRAELI LIAISON WITH LOCAL </p><p>FORCES WHICH ARE DEDICATED AGAINST TERRORISM.  D)  IF THE </p><p>LOCAL FORCES ARE ATTACKED THE IDF MAY RESPOND TO PROTECT </p><p>THEM. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>5.  ISRAEL\'S RELATIONS WITH THE SLA </p><p>-   ------------------------------- </p><p>KIMCHE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAS HELPED AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO HELP THE SOUTH LEBANON  (SLA), </p><p>BUT NO LONGER CONTROLS THE SECURITY ZONE.  HE SAID THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SLA IS ONE OF LIAISON AND ADVICE, </p><p>BUT IT DOES NOT PERMIT ISRAEL TO GIVE ORDERS, AND THE SLA </p><p>IS NOT A DE FACTO ISRAELI FORCE.  THE SLA IS LEBANESE, </p><p>COMMANDED BY A LEBANESE GENERAL, AND IT BEHAVES AS THE </p><p>LEBANESE BEHAVE, NOT AS ISRAELIS WOULD.  THIS MEANS THAT </p><p>THE SLA OFTEN ACTS IN A MANNER WHICH IS  DISTASTEFUL TO </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE "UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT" WITH UNIFIL </p><p>-   -------------------------------------- </p><p>KIMCHE SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF  ISRAEL DEPLORES "THE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT", AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT SETTLED. </p><p>HE SAID ISRAEL HAS GIVEN THE FOLLOWING ADVICE TO THE SLA: </p><p>A) NOT TO HARM ANY OF THE HOSTAGES; HE SAID THE SLA HAS </p><p>COMMITTED ITSELF TO DO NO HARM TO THE FINNISH SOLDIERS, </p><p>AND THIS IS BEING OBSERVED.  B) ISRAEL HAS ADVISED LAHAD </p><p>TO RELEASE THE HOSTAGES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TALKS WITH </p><p>UNIFIL.  HE SAID THAT THE ISSUE MUST BE RESOLVED BY UNIFIL </p><p>AND THE SLA DIRECTLY.  ON NO ACCOUNT, HE EMPHASIZED, SHOUL </p><p>ISRAEL BE A DIRECT PARTY.  ISRAEL IS OUT OF LEBANON; IF </p><p>IT WERE TO DEAL DIRECTLY THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT ISRAEL </p><p>IS STILL IN.  KIMCHE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT IS TRUE THAT </p><p>ISRAEL STILL HAS LIAISON OFFICERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON, BUT </p><p>HE ASSERTED THAT THE NUMBERS ARE FEWER THAN THOSE WHICH </p><p>WERE ACCEPTED IN THE MAY 17 AGREEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>WELCOMED BY MANY STATES INCLUDING EGYPT. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE UNIFIL-SLA MEETING </p><p>-   ---------------------- </p><p>KIMCHE SAID THAT THE MEETING BETWEEN GENERALS LAHAD AND </p><p>PONS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  HE SAID THEY DIS- </p><p>CUSSED THE RELEASE OF THE CAPTIVES; THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ISRAEL THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE MET FROM THE VERY BEGIN- </p><p>NING, BUT THIS MEETING AT LEAST WAS HELD IN A GOOD </p><p>ATMOSPHERE.  THE GIST OF THE MEETING WAS:  LAHAD ASKED </p><p>UNIFIL FOR THE ELEVEN SLA TROOPS TO BE BROUGHT TO A </p><p>NEUTRAL PLACE WHERE IT COULD BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY </p><p>HAD IN FACT DEFECTED OR HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND TURNED OVER </p><p>TO AMAL.  HE SAID THAT IF THE ELEVEN STATE THAT THEY HAD </p><p>DEFECTED, THE FINNS WILL BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY BY LAHAD. </p><p>IT HAD ALSO BEEN AGREED DURING THE MEETING TO APPOINT </p><p>LIAISON OFFICERS BETWEEN GENERALS PONS AND LAHAD, AND </p><p>UNIFIL HAD SECURED THE RIGHT TO VISIT THE FINNISH </p><p>SOLDIERS EVERY THREE OR FOUR DAYS.  KIMCHE SAID, OF COURSE </p><p>HE HOPED THE PROBLEM WOULD BE SOLVED BEFORE THAT TIME </p><p>LIMIT.  KIMCHE CONCLUDED THAT HE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOW </p><p>UP TO UNIFIL TO BRING THE ELEVEN TO A NEUTRAL SPOT, </p><p>PERHAPS NAQURA. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  GENERAL REMARKS </p><p>-   --------------- </p><p>KIMCHE OFFERED THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL REMARKS:  SINCE </p><p>THERE IS NO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEBANON, ISRAEL UNDER- </p><p>STANDS THE NEED FOR UNIFIL TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH THE AMAL </p><p>MILITIAS.  IN FACT HE SAID THIS IS A POSITIVE THING.  IN </p><p>THE PAST UNIFIL HAD SAID THAT IT COULD DEAL ONLY WITH THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON.  BUT SINCE THAT PROVED </p><p>IMPRACTICAL, AND UNIFIL IS NOW DEALING WITH AMAL, IT </p><p>SHOULD ALSO DEAL WITH THE SLA.  HE SAID THIS NOW SEEMS TO </p><p>BE IN PROGRESS.  ISRAEL, HE SAID, WOULD LIKE A STRONG CEN- </p><p>TRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEBANON, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE </p><p>LIAISON WITH THE LEBANESE ARMY.  BUT THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE, </p><p>AND THERE IS LITTLE HOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE FORESEEABL </p><p>FUTURE.  KIMCHE THEN DESCRIBED THE INTERFACTIONAL FIGHTING </p><p>WITHIN LEBANON,  NOTING THAT IT APPEARS THAT ALL FACTIONS </p><p>ARE NOW FIGHTING WITH ALL OTHERS, FOLLOWING A RECENT </p><p>REPORT OF A SHIA-DRUZE CONFLICT THIS MORNING. </p><p>- </p><p>9.  JAZZIN </p><p>-   ------ </p><p>KIMCHE SAID THAT JAZZIN COULD BE THE NEW FLASHPOINT.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAD NEVER TOLD OR </p><p>ADVISED THE SLA TO GO TO JAZZIN, AND FURTHER </p><p>ADVISED THE SLA THAT IF IT DECIDED TO GO TO JAZZIN, </p><p>ISRAEL WOULD NOT HELP THE SLA BECAUSE JAZZIN IS OUTSIDE </p><p>THE SECURITY ZONE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAD PROPOSED </p><p>TO UNIFIL THAT IT DEPLOY TO JAZZIN, SINCE IT HAD FORCES </p><p>CLOSE BY.  HE SAID THE GOI WOULD WELCOME A UNIFIL DEPLOY- </p><p>MENT TO JAZZIN AND WOULD ADVISE THE SLA TO WITHDRAW IN </p><p>THAT CASE.  THE UN SECRETARY HAD THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD </p><p>IDEA AND TRIED IT OUT WITH PRESIDENT GEMAYEL.  GEMAYEL </p><p>ALSO, ACCORDING TO KIMCHE, THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA </p><p>BUT DECLINED TO REQUEST A UNIFIL PRESENCE IN JAZZIN </p><p>BECAUSE HE KNEW HE COULDN\'T GAIN THE SUPPORT OF EITHER </p><p>SYRIA OR HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER.  HE SAID THIS ALSO </p><p>DEMONSTRATES THE WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON. </p><p>- </p><p>10.  THE FINNS VERSUS THE SLA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>KIMCHE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW THE FACTS.  HE SAID THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERWAY, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE UN </p><p>STILL BELIEVES THAT THE ELEVEN SLA TROOPS DEFECTED. </p><p>THE GOI, HE SAID, IS SKEPTICAL; IT BELIEVES THEY WERE </p><p>ABDUCTED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS WHICH KIMCHE ADMITTED </p><p>WERE CIRCUMSTANTIAL:  A) ALL OF THE ELEVEN LEFT THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES BEHIND.  KNOWING THAT THE SLA IS NOT A GENTLE </p><p>FORCE, THEY WOULD CLEARLY HAVE BEEN AFRAID FOR THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES IF THEY HAD VOLUNTARILY DEFECTED.  B) SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER THE SLA ELEVEN WERE MOVED TO TYRE, AMAL LEADER </p><p>NABIH BERRI SAID THAT HE WOULD EXCHANGE THE ELEVEN </p><p>PRISONERS FOR THE SHIA PRISONERS HELD IN ISRAEL.  KIMCHE </p><p>SAID IT WOULD BE RARE INDEED TO OFFER TO EXCHANGE </p><p>DEFECTORS FOR OTHER PRISONERS.  C) HE THEN SHOWED A TV </p><p>FILM MADE BY A SYRIAN CREW JUST AFTER THE ELEVEN REACHED </p><p>TYRE.  THE CAPTIVES WERE SHOWN BEING HELD UNDER ARMED </p><p>GUARD, SULLEN, APPARENTLY FEARFUL, AND RESPONDING TO </p><p>ORDERS BY THEIR GUARDS.  KIMCHE SAID THIS APPEARED NOT TO </p><p>BE THE DEMEANOR OF PERSONS WHO HAD VOLUNTARILY DEFECTED. </p><p>- </p><p>11.  KIMCHE CONCLUDED THIS SESSION BY NOTING THAT ISRAEL </p><p>MAY NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH, BUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAE </p><p>WANTS THE FINNS RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT ALL THAT ISRAEL WANTS IS PEACE ON THE NORTHERN </p><p>FRONTIER. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AMBASSADORS\' COMMENTS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THERE WAS A PRESS REPORT </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WOULD CONTEMPLATE A MOVE OF </p><p>UNIFIL TO THE BORDER UNDER AN ARRANGEMENT AGREED TO WITH </p><p>THE SLA.  KIMCHE SAID THE UN HAD PRESENTED SOME IDEAS TO </p><p>THE GOI ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNIFIL DEPLOYMENT TO THE </p><p>BORDER WITH THE DE FACTO COOPERATION OF THE SLA.  NO </p><p>DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED, AND THE SUBJECT WAS NOT </p><p>THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED IN THE RABIN/URQUHART MEETING </p><p>YESTERDAY.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE MEANTIME, UNTIL </p><p>SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT IS WORKED OUT, ISRAELI POLICY, AS </p><p>DETERMINED BY THE CABINET, REMAINS.  HE ADDED HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT ISRAEL IS PREPARED TO CONSIDER ANY IDEAS FOR </p><p>STRENGTHENING THE STABILITY OF THE BORDER AREA. </p><p>- </p><p>13.  THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE EC-10 HAD MET </p><p>AND HAD MADE A GENERAL STATEMENT ON LEBANON.  HE SAID THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE TEN CONSIDERED THE INCIDENT VERY </p><p>SERIOUS.  THEIR OPINION WAS THAT EVERY MEASURE SHOULD BE </p><p>TAKEN TO FREE ALL HOSTAGES.  AMBASSADOR TALIANI ADDED A </p><p>PERSONAL NOTE SAYING THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO </p><p>ACCEPT ISRAELI DISCLAIMERS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN VIEW OF </p><p>THE FACT THAT ISRAEL HAD ARMED AND EQUIPPED AND CONTINUED </p><p>TO PAY THE SLA.  KIMCHE REPLIED THAT GIVING ASSISTANCE </p><p>DOES NOT MEAN CONTROL.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID, THE 3,000 </p><p>SOVIET ADVISERS IN SYRIA DO NOT MEAN THAT THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION CONTROLS SYRIA.  HE SAID IF ISRAEL ACCEPTED THE </p><p>ITALIAN AMBASSADOR\'S PREMISE, THE IDF WOULD BE DOOMED TO </p><p>STAY IN LEBANON IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. </p><p>- </p><p>14.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR STATED THE STRONG DESIRE OF </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THE FINNISH TROOPS RELEASED AS SOON </p><p>AS POSSIBLE.  HE ADDED THAT HE FELT THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ISRAEL HAS A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR INTERVENED AGAIN TO NOTE THAT </p><p>IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO ACCEPT THE TAKING OF </p><p>HOSTAGES.  HE SAID HIS MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT WAS VERY </p><p>EXERCISED OVER THE HOSTAGE ISSUE.  HE SAID ANY ACTION THAT </p><p>ENCOURAGES THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES IS BAD BOTH IN THIS CASE </p><p>AND IN THE GENERAL SENSE.  KIMCHE SAID HE AGREED THAT ANY </p><p>TAKING OF HOSTAGES IS BAD.  HE CONCEDED THAT PERHAPS </p><p>ISRAEL COULD SEND IN ITS TROOPS TO FORCE THEIR RELEASE. </p><p>BUT IF THE IDF DID GO IN, IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE </p><p>SLA, AND THE GOI WOULD HAVE TO BE BACK IN LEBANON TO STAY. </p><p>HE SAID ISRAEL HAS GIVEN STRONG ADVICE TO LAHAD THAT IT </p><p>WAS WRONG TO HOLD HOSTAGES.  BUT HE ADDED THAT THE ELEVEN </p><p>SLA TROOPS MAY ALSO BE AS MUCH HOSTAGE AS THE FINNS.  HE </p><p>SAID THEREFORE THE ONLY LINE OF ATTACK IS TO FOLLOW UP ON </p><p>THE LAHAD  PROPOSAL.  HE THEN URGED THE CONTRIBUTORS </p><p>TO UNIFUL TO PRESS THE UN TO HAVE THE AMAL BRING THE </p><p>ELEVEN TROOPS TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE SO IT COULD DETERMINE </p><p>IF THEY WERE VOLUNTARILY DEFECTORS OR IN FACT CAPTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>WELCOMES THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM LEBANON, BUT ADDED </p><p>THAT THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF LIAISON OFFICERS LEAVES </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL CONSIDERABLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT PRESENT.  HE SAID THE HOSTAGES SHOULD </p><p>BE RELEASED WITHOUT CONDITIONS IMMEDIATELY. </p><p>- </p><p>17.  COMMENT - THIS WAS THE THIRD OF A SERIES OF MEETINGS </p><p>THAT KIMCHE HAS HAD WITH THIS GROUP ON LEBANON.  KIMCHE </p><p>STATED THE CASE WITH CLARITY AND PRECISION, BUT HIS </p><p>AUDIENCE WAS NOT CONVINCED.  CONCERNING THE HOSTAGES, HE </p><p>REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT ISRAEL COULD BE EITHER IN </p><p>LEBANON OR OUT, AND IF OUT, ISRAEL COULD NOT FORCE LAHAD </p><p>TO DO WHAT HE DIDN\'T WANT TO DO.  BEHIND THIS DENIAL OF </p><p>CONTROL OF LAHAD IS KIMCHE\'S CONVICTION THAT TO TRY TO </p><p>FORCE LAHAD WOULD MEAN THE END OF LAHAD AND LAHAD\'S FORCES </p><p>CLEARLY THIS IS A CARD WHICH ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN WILLING </p><p>TO PLAY.  IT IS ALSO CLEAR, AS KIMCHE IMPLIED SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES, THAT ISRAELI POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON IS SUBJECT </p><p>TO CHANGE AS THE TACTICAL SITUATION SHIFTS.  BUT ISRAEL IS </p><p>STILL COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING LAHAD IN GENERAL AND IN HIS </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITH UNIFIL, AND IS UNWILLING TO FACE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SLA.  IF THE SLA </p><p>SHOULD CRUMBLE, THE PERES GOVERNMENT\'S LEBANON  WITH- </p><p>DRAWAL DECISION, UP TO NOW A VERY POPULAR ONE, COULD </p><p>SPRING AGAIN INTO THE CENTER OF POLITICAL  CONTRO- </p><p>VERSY HERE.  CERTAINLY SHARON AND HIS ALLIES WOULD MAKE </p><p>THE MOST OF IT TO WEAKEN THE PERES GOVERNMENT AND FURTHER </p><p>INHIBIT ITS ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON EITHER THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>FRONT OR THE PEACE PROCESS ISSUES NOW UNDER DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>18.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>FLATEN </p><p></p></div>
