<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/CGURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOIST NEGOTIATING TEAM HOLDS PUBLIC RALLY </p><p>IN KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On April 3, the Maoists held a rally of an estimated </p><p>20,000 in a public park in Kathmandu.  Near the venue, widows </p><p>and orphans of Maoist violence called for charges to be </p><p>brought against the Maoist leadership.  The Maoist </p><p>negotiating team led by Baburam Bhattarai reiterated their </p><p>demands for a roundtable meeting, an interim cabinet, and a </p><p>constituent assembly.  They described themselves as champions </p><p>of the people and called for the creation of a new, </p><p>representative constitution.  The Maoist military leader, Ram </p><p>Bahadur Thapa, proposed the merger of the People\'s Liberation </p><p>Army with the Royal Nepal Army under the authority of an </p><p>elected body.  At no time did the speakers apologize for past </p><p>excesses and in fact threatened to "return to the jungle," if </p><p>the Government of Nepal failed to negotiate a settlement. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Supporters and Spectators Gather for Maoist Show </p><p>============================================= === </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 3, an estimated 20,000 people gathered in a </p><p>public park in the heart of Kathmandu to listen to the </p><p>five-member Maoist negotiating team.  According to Embassy </p><p>contacts, the attendees were a mix of genuine supporters (25 </p><p>percent), plain clothes security personnel (10-15 percent), </p><p>and curiosity seekers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the </p><p>heretofore elusive Maoist leaders.  The Maoist group was led </p><p>by chief ideologue Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, who was accompanied </p><p>by negotiation team members Ram Bahadur Thapa (alias "Badal," </p><p>a politburo member and chief of the People\'s Liberation </p><p>Army), and politburo members Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Matrika </p><p>Prasad Yadav, and Dev Gurung.  The event was well-organized </p><p>and peaceful.  In addition to plain clothes police, roughly </p><p>700 uniformed officers surrounded the event to provide </p><p>security and to direct traffic. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Themes Unchanged:  Details Sketchy </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Bhattarai reiterated the now familiar Maoist </p><p>political agenda: a roundtable meeting, interim cabinet, and </p><p>constituent assembly.  He explained the timing of the </p><p>cease-fire as a reflection of the "ground reality that </p><p>neither we (Maoists) nor the state could win, which brought </p><p>us to the negotiating table."  Bhattarai and the other Maoist </p><p>negotiators repeatedly alleged that Nepal\'s constitution and </p><p>democratic political order are dead, done in by the King when </p><p>he dismissed the Sher Bahadur Deuba government on October 4, </p><p>2002.  They stated that their goal is to usher in a "new </p><p>Nepal," in which there would be equal representation from all </p><p>religions, castes, communities, and genders in an "upcoming </p><p>parliament." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On the podium, the Maoist speakers presented </p><p>themselves as the champions of the people.  Yadav went so far </p><p>as to say the "Maoists are here not to rule but to serve." </p><p>The speakers placed the blame for the conflict at the feet of </p><p>the political parties, berating them for twelve years of poor </p><p>governance and corruption.  Despite these charges, Bhattarai </p><p>insisted that the Maoists intend to work with the King and </p><p>the political parties at a roundtable conference.  Bhattarai </p><p>stated that the Maoists would abide by the results of the </p><p>constituent assembly and called for "no unalterable articles </p><p>or provisions" in the new constitution.  "The people should </p><p>have the right to amend the constitution any time they want </p><p>through referendum.  Let the people decide if they want </p><p>active monarchy or a republic through a referendum." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) At no time during the rally did the speakers </p><p>apologize for past destructive excesses.  Thapa asserted that </p><p>"our bullets were for the oppressed people, whereas the </p><p>state\'s bullets were to suppress the people."  Thapa and </p><p>Bhattarai threatened to return to the jungles to fight </p><p>against the "reactionary forces," should peace talks fail. </p><p>They also called for the merging of the Royal Nepal Army with </p><p>the "People\'s Liberation Army" to form a new national army. </p><p>According to Thapa, the new army should be under the </p><p>authority of elected representatives because "until and </p><p>unless the army operates under the elected body, chances of </p><p>despotism are always there." </p><p> </p><p>Widows and Orphans Confront Bhattarai </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Near the rally, survivors of people killed in the </p><p>insurgency held a counter-demonstration, where they charged </p><p>Bhattarai with crimes against the Nepali people.  Waving </p><p>black flags and shouting, "who will take action against these </p><p>criminals?" the widows and orphans appeared to have shaken </p><p>Bhattarai.  Some of the Maoist strongmen moved to block the </p><p>counter-demonstrators, urging them to protest on a different </p><p>day. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Local press coverage of the rally could convey the </p><p>impression that the public has accepted the Maoists with open </p><p>arms.  But in a society where nearly half of the work force </p><p>is underemployed, it is important not to confuse the draw of </p><p>the Maoists as pure spectacle and diversion with true </p><p>ideological appeal.  Public fascination should not be equated </p><p>with political support; the Maoist leaders have been in </p><p>hiding and inaccessible for seven years, and their appearance </p><p>in public is a novelty that may wear off in time.  The Maoist </p><p>claim to be the "people\'s champion" is belied by the Maoist </p><p>practices of maintaining arms, continuing extortion, and </p><p>threatening to return to violence should they not get their </p><p>way through negotiation.  More time and evidence of </p><p>compromise is necessary to test the Maoists\' sincerity for a </p><p>peaceful, political resolution to the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Since the leadership\'s coming out reception on </p><p>March 29, the Maoists have made generous use of double-speak </p><p>directed at the government and the political parties.  In </p><p>private meetings with established figures, the Maoists </p><p>reportedly have praised the efforts of Government of Nepal </p><p>and political party leaders to work towards peace, while in </p><p>public the Maoists have taken every opportunity to criticize </p><p>leading political and government personalities.  Such tactics </p><p>may backfire by increasing the already substantial distrust </p><p>felt by their future negotiating partners. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
