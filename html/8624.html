Two journalists working for the independent short-wave </p><p>      radio station Voice of the People (VOP) were detained and </p><p>      beaten by ZANU-PF youths and war veterans at the beginning </p><p>      (June 2) of the week-long mass protests organized by the </p><p>      opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  The </p><p>      assailants confiscated the journalists\' mobile phones and </p><p>      minidisk recorders.  Shorai Katiwa and Martin Chimenya were </p><p>      attacked at the University of Zimbabwe while covering a </p><p>      demonstration by students who intended to march to downtown </p><p>      Harare.  According to John Masuku, the Coordinator of VOP </p><p>      who spoke to the MISA-Zimbabwe (Media Institute of Southern </p><p>      Africa), the journalists were taken to Borrowdale Police </p><p>      Station for interrogation.  From Borrowdale they were taken </p><p>      to the ZANU-PF Headquarters in the city center where they </p><p>      were further interrogated and beaten. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Eight men wearing police uniforms and driving four </p><p>      police cars raided the home of Edwina Spicer, a documentary </p><p>      film producer, at midnight on June 6. Without producing a </p><p>      search warrant, the unidentified intruders confiscated </p><p>      video cameras, recording equipment, a fax machine and </p><p>      Z$50,000.  Mrs. Spicer is currently away on holiday in </p><p>      England, but her gardener, maid and security guard were all </p><p>      beaten during the raid.  The break-in at the Spicer </p><p>      residence has come under fire from MISA, who said in a June </p><p>      7 statement that "the manner in which this search was </p><p>      carried out clearly spells out the danger media workers are </p><p>      under" in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
