(U)  THIS CABLE CONTAINS A GUIDANCE REQUEST -- PLEASE </p><p>SEE PARA FIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  PURSUANT TO REF C, CHARGE AND A/DCM MET IN THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF 5/4 WITH SANT\'EGIDIO FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR </p><p>ANDREA RICCARDI TO DISCUSS HOW TO PUSH THE PACE OF THE </p><p>PROPOSED INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE FOR BOSNIA.  RICCARDI\'S </p><p>ASSISTANT, CLAUDIO BETTI, HAD HEARD FROM CARDINAL PULJIC </p><p>(THE KEY INTERLOCUTOR IN THIS DIALOGUE) THAT PULJIC </p><p>SUPPORTS THE CONFERENCE BUT THAT THE EARLIEST HE CAN ATTEND </p><p>WOULD BE JUNE 7-8.  SANT\'EGIDIO IS PUSHING AHEAD TO CONFIRM </p><p>THE OTHER INVITEES FOR THAT DATE.  A/DCM REMINDED RICCARDI </p><p>THAT THE IMPENDING HDZ DECLARATION OF A SEPARATE ENTITY IN </p><p>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA HAS LENT SOME URGENCY TO THE CONFERENCE, </p><p>BUT RICCARDI INSISTED THAT TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE </p><p>PULJIC NEEDED TO BE FULLY ON BOARD, AND JUNE 7 IS THE BEST </p><p>THEY CAN DO. </p><p>3.  (C)  RICCARDI TOLD US THAT SANT\'EGIDIO WOULD IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME HAVE OTHER MEETINGS WITH THE CARDINAL IN WHICH </p><p>THEY WOULD PRESS HIM TO TAKE A MODERATE LINE VIS A VIS THE </p><p>HDZ GAMBIT.  DON VICENZO PAGLIA WILL SEE PULJIC SOON FOR A </p><p>CONFIRMATION IN BOSNIA; RICCARDI SAID THAT DON VICENZO WILL </p><p>PRESS FOR MODERATION, AS WILL RICCARDI HIMSELF WHEN HE SEES </p><p>PULJIC DURING THE 5/23 CONSISTORY IN ROME.  RICCARDI </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE FACT THAT PULJIC ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF AN </p><p>OFF-SITE CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS INTERCOMMUNAL RECONCILIATION </p><p>INDICATES THAT PULJIC IS "LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02499  071528Z </p><p>BOX." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PER REF B, CHARGE CALLED UK AMBASSADOR PELLEW IN </p><p>THE MORNING OF 5/4 TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THAT THE </p><p>PROJECT IS SANT\'EGIDIO\'S.  (NOTE:  POST HAS PUSHED </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY FOR THE CONFERENCE TO OCCUR ASAP, AS WELL AS </p><p>FOR CO-FUNDING OF THE CONFERENCE, AND HAS SECURED A PLEDGE </p><p>FROM THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY HERE TO PROVIDE AIR TRANSPORT FOR </p><p>THE BOSNIANS AS WELL AS A PLEDGE FROM THE SWEDISH EMBASSY </p><p>(EU PRESIDENCY) TO CO-FUND THE REMAINDER OF THE EXPENSES. </p><p>BUT THE TIME HAS COME FOR SANT\'EGIDIO TO TAKE THE REINS. </p><p>END NOTE.)  PELLEW (PLEASE PROTECT), PERHAPS REFLECTING </p><p>FRUSTRATION THAT HIS MISSION HAS BEEN OUT OF THE LOOP, TOLD </p><p>US SANT\'EGIDIO IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN GIVEN SUFFICIENT LEAD </p><p>TO DO THINGS IN THEIR OWN WAY (READ: SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT </p><p>DELIBERATION).  HE WASN\'T CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL EVENT IF "PRESSURIZED" BY THE USG.  WE </p><p>LATER ASSURED RICCARDI THAT WE SEE THIS AS A SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>PROJECT, AND THAT WE WERE THERE TO HELP AS NEEDED.  HE TOO </p><p>BELIEVED THAT WAS THE BEST APPROACH, AND SAID SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>WOULD COORDINATE AMONG THE OTHER EMBASSIES INVOLVED.  POST </p><p>WILL NOT HESITATE TO JUMP BACK IN, HOWEVER, IF SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>LOOKS LIKE IT IS DROPPING THE BALL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  RICCARDI SUGGESTED THAT WE SEE PULJIC WHEN HE IS </p><p>HERE -- WE CAN DO SO AND WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE FROM </p><p>DEPARTMENT/EMBASSY SARAJEVO ON WHETHER TO DO SO AND LATEST </p><p>TALKING POINTS TO DEPLOY.        MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA02499 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
