(C) Summary: The UN country team in Burma has painted a </p><p>stark picture of the nation\'s humanitarian situation.  It has </p><p>also forecast dire consequences for Burma\'s poor, and for </p><p>regional stability, if the situation is not addressed </p><p>quickly.  The UNDP Resident Representative in Rangoon will </p><p>present the country team\'s findings during the upcoming Tokyo </p><p>meetings.  Resolution of these problems, and the prevention </p><p>of a full-blown crisis, depend first and foremost on a more </p><p>responsible and responsive government.  However, there are </p><p>ways to make marginal improvements and to perhaps delay the </p><p>onset of crisis.  As it has with the fight against HIV/AIDS </p><p>here, the U.S. government should consider contributing to </p><p>this effort.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Humanitarian Crisis in the Making </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During the upcoming Tokyo meetings on Burma, the UNDP </p><p>Resident Representative in Rangoon plans to deliver a dire </p><p>assessment of the humanitarian situation facing Burma.  The </p><p>assessment stems from a recently completed UN report entitled </p><p>"A Review of the Humanitarian Situation in Myanmar." </p><p>According to the report, Burma\'s persistent consumer price </p><p>inflation (estimated by the Embassy at about 60 percent in </p><p>2002, with higher levels for key staples), combined with the </p><p>serious erosion of basic social services (for example, the </p><p>GOB has budgeted only $25,000 for fighting HIV/AIDS), have </p><p>put the country\'s poorest people on the precipice of </p><p>disaster.  The UN report is the first of two volumes; the </p><p>second will include some "quick impact" project proposals and </p><p>go into the country-specific problems of delivering and </p><p>monitoring humanitarian assistance in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The results of the malignant combination of inflation </p><p>and poor social services, according to the report, are </p><p>increasing poverty, landlessness, food insecurity, spreading </p><p>disease (especially TB, malaria, and HIV), and a </p><p>deterioration in the country\'s education system.  These </p><p>factors are not felt equally across the country, hitting </p><p>particularly hard ethnic minorities residing in remote border </p><p>areas and peri-urban slum dwellers.  The report recognizes </p><p>rapidly expanding disparities between urban, peri-urban, and </p><p>rural populations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The report also stresses how symptoms combine to </p><p>exacerbate the situation.  Some examples: malnutrition and </p><p>poor food security hamper people\'s ability to fight disease </p><p>and thus earn income; poor access to clean water leads to </p><p>high child and infant mortality; and, a weak education system </p><p>undermines a country\'s economic strength. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The UN points out that the impact of Burma\'s </p><p>accelerating humanitarian crisis is also felt well beyond the </p><p>country\'s borders.  It is very disruptive to regional </p><p>stability, and a major obstacle to the international </p><p>community\'s efforts to combat trafficking in persons, </p><p>HIV/AIDS, and other social plagues.  In particular, the </p><p>report illustrates in detail the connection between poverty, </p><p>malnutrition, and slipping educational standards, on the one </p><p>hand, and narcotics production and use, the AIDS epidemic, </p><p>prostitution, and trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>Who\'s to Blame? </p><p> </p><p>6 (C) The report gives the SPDC the credit and blame it </p><p>deserves.  The UN is justifiably concerned with being too </p><p>harsh on the GOB, but realizes the importance of giving a </p><p>relatively frank assessment to those assembled in Tokyo. </p><p>According to one UN official here, there was much discussion </p><p>in the UN country team regarding how far to go in each </p><p>direction.  Apparently there was concern that traditional </p><p>opponents of the SPDC would use overwhelming criticism of the </p><p>regime as further justification for withholding any </p><p>international assistance that might be used to "bail the </p><p>government out" of its predicament. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Nonetheless, the final UN report seems to have struck </p><p>a good balance.  The GOB gets credit for improvement of water </p><p>and sanitation facilities, construction of schools, improving </p><p>stability in border regions via ceasefire accords, and </p><p>reducing opium cultivation.  However, the UN makes it clear </p><p>that the GOB\'s actions have not done enough -- for example </p><p>pointing out the lack of well-trained teachers to staff the </p><p>new schools.  In addition, the report, while not specifically </p><p>mentioning the SPDC, asserts that "humanitarian issues...are </p><p>often an extension of...weaknesses in the policy framework, </p><p>stability, peace and security, the macro-economic </p><p>environment, level and quality of social services, civil </p><p>society participation, and transparency and accountability." </p><p> </p><p>How to Stop the Slide </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The UN report\'s prescription is very straightforward: </p><p>find a way to meet the needs of the people.  This should be </p><p>the first priority for all parties, inside and outside of </p><p>Burma, interested in the future of the country.  The report </p><p>correctly points out that simply ignoring the gorilla in the </p><p>room will not make it go away.  In fact, this policy of </p><p>neglect will only lead to increased regional tensions, </p><p>"vulnerability and social instability." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We agree with the UN\'s assessment, and its blame for </p><p>the situation.  In particular, the UN\'s outline of areas of </p><p>concern is right on target.  Continuing to ignore the </p><p>multitude of very serious social ills in Burma will doom it </p><p>to an ill-fed, under-educated, and unhealthy generation -- </p><p>the generation that could well be called on to rebuild a </p><p>democratic nation.  Admittedly, these problems cannot be </p><p>completely resolved unless the current regime changes its </p><p>priorities.  While the international community cannot carry </p><p>the entire burden in the interim, it can certainly contribute </p><p>to some incremental improvements.  As U.S. AID has found with </p><p>its nascent HIV/AIDS program in Burma, there are </p><p>international NGOs that are able to work quite independently </p><p>of the current regime in areas of critical humanitarian need. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
