<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002163 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, KU, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT STRONGLY PROTESTS NEW LANGUAGE ON </p><p>COMPENSATION IN DRAFT UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA\'s Director General for International </p><p>Organizations, Ambassador Abd al-Hamid al-Awadi, called the </p><p>Ambassador at home late in the evening of May 20.  Al-Awadi </p><p>explained that he had been instructed to contact the </p><p>Ambassador at this late hour by First Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>and Foreign Minister, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in </p><p>order to register Kuwait\'s deep concern with Operative </p><p>Paragraph 21 of the proposed new UN Security Council </p><p>resolution on Iraq.  At Shaykh Sabah\'s request, al-Awadi </p><p>would also be contacting the Ambassadors of the UK and Spain </p><p>and would instruct Kuwait\'s embassies in Washington, Madrid </p><p>and London to make parallel demarches.  According to </p><p>al-Awadi, the Kuwaiti delegation had worked out mutually </p><p>acceptable language for the operative paragraph (which deals </p><p>with using oil revenues to fund compensation claims by </p><p>victims of the 1990-91 Gulf War) with USUN on Thursday, May </p><p>15.  The GOK was shocked when it saw that the US side had </p><p>changed the agreed language without further consultation </p><p>with Kuwait.  He claimed that USUN had told the Kuwaiti </p><p>delegation in New York that it also was unaware of the </p><p>genesis of the change, which had come from Washington. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s questions, al-Awadi </p><p>said that Kuwait was particularly concerned by a new clause </p><p>in the paragraph that would allow a future internationally </p><p>recognized Iraqi government and the governing board of the UN </p><p>Compensation Commission to change arrangements for the </p><p>funding of compensation claims.  He said that Kuwait would </p><p>much prefer that such decisions "not be transferred to </p><p>Geneva" but remain in the hands of the UN Security Council </p><p>alone.  In response to a further question, he said that he </p><p>had no guidance on whether Kuwait might be able to accept </p><p>substituting the UNSC for the UNCC governing board in the </p><p>currently proposed language.  Shaykh Sabah had only told him </p><p>to protest the change from the previously agreed language and </p><p>urge a return to it.  He added that Shaykh Sabah felt </p><p>strongly that Kuwait had made significant compromises </p><p>throughout the draft resolution and believed that this should </p><p>be taken fully into account as Washington considered his </p><p>request.  The Ambassador agreed to convey these points to the </p><p>Department. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  It is quite unusual for an MFA official to </p><p>contact the Ambassador at home at such a late hour.  This no </p><p>doubt reflects the high anxiety that the GOK evidently feels </p><p>about the new language in Operative Paragraph 21 of the draft </p><p>UNSC resolution.  We are not sure why the GOK would object so </p><p>strongly to a delegation of authority for compensation </p><p>funding decisions from the UNSC to the UNCC governing board, </p><p>since according to al-Awadi, the country membership is the </p><p>same for both bodies.  However, we presume that it may have </p><p>something to do with differences in procedures between them </p><p>such as lack of P-5 veto power, or perhaps with a perception </p><p>that transferring authority to Geneva would lead to a </p><p>diminution of international attention to compensation. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
