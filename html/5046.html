<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SOFIA 000088 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1/10/13 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, BU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SQUARING THE LAWYERS\' CIRCLE:  LEADING </p><p>FIGURES IN BULGARIA\'S RULING PARTY COME UNDER ATTACK </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) 01 SOFIA 2950, B) SOFIA 23, C) SOFIA 33 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA ROD MOORE, PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE FOUR MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE SO-CALLED "LAWYERS CIRCLE," WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTREMELY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THE RULING NATIONAL </p><p>MOVEMENT SIMEON II (NDSV), HAVE COME UNDER VARYING </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z </p><p>DEGREES OF SUSTAINED CRITICISM IN RECENT WEEKS, MUCH </p><p>OF IT RELATED TO CORRUPTION.  THE PRIME MINISTER HAS </p><p>THUS FAR BEEN AVERSE TO TAKING DECISIVE ACTION IN SUCH </p><p>MATTERS.  HIS REACTION TO THE CONTROVERSIES SWIRLING </p><p>AROUND INTERIOR MINISTER PETKANOV, DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>SVINAROV, SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT GERDZHIKOV AND NDSV </p><p>FLOOR LEADER PANAYOTOV, WILL SAY MUCH ABOUT HIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND MAY ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON </p><p>THE LONGEVITY OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN THE HETEROGENEOUS </p><p>RULING PARTY, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL HAS BEEN THE SO- </p><p>CALLED "LAWYERS CIRCLE" (REF A).  IT IS COMPOSED </p><p>PRIMARILY OF FORMER PROFESSORS FROM THE SOFIA </p><p>UNIVERSITY LAW FACULTY AND THEIR STUDENTS.  THE </p><p>LEADING FIGURES ARE THE FORMER LAW PROFESSORS OGNYAN </p><p>GERDZHIKOV (NOW SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT), PLAMEN </p><p>PANAYOTOV (FLOOR LEADER OF THE NDSV PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>FACTION) AND GEORGI PETKANOV (MINISTER OF INTERIOR). </p><p>ALL ARE REPORTEDLY CLOSE TO THE PM\'S NOTORIOUS FORMER </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF, STOYAN GANEV.  LAWYER NIKOLAY SVINAROV </p><p>WAS NOT A KEY MEMBER OF THIS GROUP INITIALLY BUT </p><p>REPORTEDLY OWES HIS APPOINTMENT AS DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>AND NDSV DEPUTY CHAIRMAN TO THEIR INFLUENCE.  (THERE </p><p>HAS ALSO BEEN UNCORROBORATED SPECULATION THAT HIS </p><p>LEGAL SERVICES FOR REPUTED ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURE </p><p>VASIL BOZHKOV, A.K.A. "THE SKULL," WHO WAS ALSO CLOSE </p><p>TO GANEV, PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS SELECTION.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) INTERIOR MINISTER PETKANOV HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT </p><p>OF RIGHT-WING SUSPICION SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT, THANKS </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z </p><p>TO HIS REPUTATION AS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>NOMENKLATURA AT SOFIA UNIVERSITY.  HIS SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>INEFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY CORRUPT PROSECUTOR GENERAL </p><p>NIKOLA FILCHEV HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FROM WOULD-BE </p><p>REFORMERS.  NOW HE IS ALSO EMBROILED IN THE "GNOME" </p><p>WIRETAPPING AFFAIR (REF C).  MOI CHIEF SECRETARY BOYKO </p><p>BORISOV TOLD THE DCM THAT HE HAD ADVISED THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER ON JANUARY 5 THAT AS A RESULT OF THE "GNOME" </p><p>SCANDAL EITHER HE, PETKANOV, OR THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE GEN CHOBANOV WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO GO.  SINCE BORISOV IS WILDLY POPULAR WITH THE </p><p>BULGARIAN PUBLIC (AND, SEEMINGLY, WITH THE PM) AND </p><p>CHOBANOV RECENTLY RECEIVED A VOTE OF "ABSOLUTE </p><p>CONFIDENCE" FROM THE PRESIDENT, BORISOV\'S CALL APPEARS </p><p>TO BE A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO OUST HIS LONG-TIME </p><p>NEMESIS PETKANOV. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) DEFENSE MINISTER SVINAROV HAS COME UNDER FIRE </p><p>RECENTLY FROM AT LEAST TWO DIRECTIONS.  A U.S. TEAM </p><p>INVESTIGATING THE ILLEGAL SALE OF DUAL-USE GOODS TO </p><p>SYRIA BY THE MOD-OWNED FIRM TEREM BRIEFED THE PM IN </p><p>DECEMBER ON ITS CONCLUSIONS THAT SVINAROV WAS AWARE OF </p><p>AT LEAST ONE SHIPMENT AFTER THE FACT, BUT FAILED TO </p><p>TAKE TIMELY ACTION TO STOP A SECOND SHIPMENT OR TO </p><p>INFORM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE </p><p>TRANSGRESSION.  CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF GEN KOLEV </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) HAS ALSO LEVELED CHARGES OF </p><p>CORRUPTION WITHIN THE MOD IN A (THUS FAR) STILL SECRET </p><p>REPORT DELIVERED TO THE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR MOD </p><p>LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z </p><p>5. (C) NDSV FLOOR LEADER (AND THE PARTY\'S FIRST DEPUTY </p><p>CHAIRMAN) PANAYOTOV HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE FIGURE AMONG </p><p>THE PARTY\'S MPS.  MANY NDSV PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE </p><p>COMPLAINED OF BEING FROZEN OUT OF DECISION-MAKING.  HE </p><p>HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HIS "AUTHORITARIAN" </p><p>MANAGEMENT STYLE AND FOR MAKING PATRONAGE APPOINTMENTS </p><p>WITHOUT CONSULTING OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.  THE </p><p>PRESS HAS BEEN REPORTING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS </p><p>THAT CHANGES IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>GROUP ARE IMMINENT, WITH THE PRIME MINISTER LIKELY TO </p><p>REPLACE PANAYOTOV WITH AN MP MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE </p><p>PARTY\'S REBELLIOUS YOUNG TURKS.  (WE BELIEVE RUMORS OF </p><p>PANAYOTOV\'S IMMINENT DEPARTURE ARE STILL VERY </p><p>SPECULATIVE, HOWEVER.)  RECENTLY PANAYOTOV ALSO MET </p><p>WITH THE "VUZRAZHDANE" BUSINESS CLUB, WHICH COUNTS </p><p>AMONG ITS MEMBERS VASIL BOZHKOV AND OTHER SHADY </p><p>"BUSINESSMEN" BELIEVED TO BE LINKED TO ORGANIZED CRIME </p><p>GROUPS.  (ONE MP CLOSE TO PANAYOTOV TOLD US HE HAD </p><p>SOUGHT AND RECEIVED THE PM\'S BLESSING FOR THIS </p><p>MEETING.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PARLIAMENT CHAIRMAN (SPEAKER) GERDZHIKOV, WHO </p><p>IS CLOSELY ALLIED WITH MINISTER PETKANOV, HAD MANAGED </p><p>TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAY UNTIL RECENTLY.  HE HAS NOW </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ7031 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        SOFIA  00088  02 OF 02  101524Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------2334C9  101524Z /38 </p><p>P 101518Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4468 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 02 SOFIA 000088 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1/10/13 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, BU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SQUARING THE LAWYERS\' CIRCLE:  LEADING </p><p>FIGURES IN BULGARIA\'S RULING PARTY COME UNDER ATTACK </p><p> </p><p>BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE FILCHEV SAGA BY EDVIN SUGAREV, A </p><p>FORMER DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE OPPOSITION UDF AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO INDIA.  SUGAREV CHARGED IN AN OPEN </p><p>LETTER RELEASED JANUARY 7 THAT GERDZHIKOV HAS BEEN </p><p>SUBJECT TO UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS POSSIBLY CORRUPT INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL PRIVATIZATION OF AGROPROMSTROI SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS AGO.  (GERDZHIKOV HAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        SOFIA  00088  02 OF 02  101524Z </p><p>FILCHEV, WHO WAS BEST MAN AT HIS WEDDING.)  GERDZHIKOV </p><p>HAS DENIED THE ACCUSATION, BUT IT HAS DRAWN ATTENTION </p><p>TO HIS FORMER BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF THE MULTIGROUP (MG) CONGLOMERATE, WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>LINKED TO ORGANIZED CRIME ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ONE PROMINENT NDSV LAWYER NOT APPARENTLY </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH THE "LAWYERS CIRCLE" IS JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER ANTON STANKOV.  STANKOV\'S REFORM EFFORTS HAVE </p><p>BEEN STYMIED BY AN ENTRENCHED JUDICIAL BUREAUCRACY </p><p>(REF B), AND HE HAS BUTTED HEADS REPEATEDLY WITH </p><p>FILCHEV.  WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER PETKANOV HAVE NOT </p><p>SUPPORTED STANKOV\'S INITIATIVES TO REFORM THE JUDICIAL </p><p>SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH RECENTLY THE PM DID INDICATE HE WOULD </p><p>SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS END. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT:  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT THE </p><p>ATTACKS ON THE "LAWYERS CIRCLE" ARE PART OF AN </p><p>ORCHESTRATED SCHEME; A NUMBER OF OTHER PROMINENT </p><p>FIGURES ARE ALSO UNDER POLITICAL AND/OR LEGAL PRESSURE </p><p>AT THIS TIME FOR VARIOUS REASONS (INCLUDING FILCHEV, </p><p>DEPUTY PM VASILEV, FORMER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE CHIEF </p><p>ATANAS ATANASOV, FORMER PM IVAN KOSTOV AND SEVERAL </p><p>OFFICIALS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION).  NOR IS IT CLEAR TO </p><p>WHAT EXTENT THE "LAWYERS CIRCLE" REMAINS A COHESIVE </p><p>GROUP.  STILL, SUGAREV\'S ATTACK ON GERDZHIKOV APPEARS </p><p>TO COMPLETE THE CHESSBOARD FOR A MAJOR POLITICAL </p><p>SHOWDOWN IN 2003.  IN ITS INITIAL STAGES, AT LEAST, IT </p><p>APPEARS THE GAME WILL PIT THE LAWYERS CIRCLE (ALONG </p><p>WITH FILCHEV) AGAINST BOTH THE CENTER-RIGHT UDF AND </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  00088  02 OF 02  101524Z </p><p>GROUPS WITHIN THE NDSV OPPOSED TO THE LAWYERS. </p><p>COMPLICATING THIS SCENARIO IS THE FACT THAT A NUMBER </p><p>OF UDF OFFICIALS REMAIN CLOSE TO FILCHEV, WHO WAS A </p><p>UDF APPOINTEE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT, CONTINUED:  IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL </p><p>WHETHER THE LAWYERS GROUP CAN RETAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF </p><p>THE PM, AND WITH IT CONTROL OF LEADING POSITIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE GOB, AND/OR WHETHER THE BATTLE WILL SPLIT </p><p>THE NDSV AND PERHAPS FORCE EARLY ELECTIONS.  MEANWHILE </p><p>THE OPPOSITION SOCIALIST PARTY (BSP), WHICH HAS A </p><p>COMFORTABLE LEAD IN MOST OPINION POLLS, SEEMS LIKELY </p><p>TO STAY ON THE SIDELINES AND LET THE OTHER PLAYERS </p><p>BATTER EACH OTHER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MOORE </p><p></p></div>
