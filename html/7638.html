<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 001747 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CF, CG, PHUM, PREL, RW, UG, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE CALLS ON WORLD NOT TO FORGET GREAT LAKES </p><p>CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 01329 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) DURING HIS WEEKLY WEDNESDAY AUDIENCE IN ST. PETER\'S </p><p>SQUARE APRIL 9, POPE JOHN PAUL II URGED THE WORLD TO NOT </p><p>    FORGET THE VIOLENT AND CONTINUING CONFLICT IN THE GREAT LAKES </p><p>REGION OF AFRICA, AND CALLED ON LEADERS TO RETURN TO THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  VATICAN OFFICIALS HAD PASSED EMBASSY A </p><p>PRO-MEMORIA ON MARCH 24 SEEKING U.S. SUPPORT IN STOPPING THE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE ITURI REGION OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CONGO AND MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS (REFTEL).  IN </p><p>THE FACE OF CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL FOCUS ON IRAQ, THE POPE </p><p>SOUGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS IN AFRICA -- A POINT </p><p>HE REITERATED IN HIS APRIL 20 EASTER MESSAGE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ADDRESSING A GENERAL AUDIENCE APRIL 6 ON THE GREAT </p><p>LAKES CONFLICT, POPE JOHN PAUL II DIRECTED "A HEARTFELT </p><p>APPEAL TO THE POLITICIANS IN CHARGE, AS WELL AS TO ALL MEN </p><p>AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL, SO THAT THEY COMMIT THEMSELVES TO </p><p>BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE, PUTTING ASIDE </p><p>PERSONAL SELFISHNESS AND GROUP INTERESTS, WITH THE ACTIVE </p><p>COLLABORATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  THE POPE WAS </p><p>RESPONDING TO REPORTS OF APRIL 6 FROM THE U.N. MISSION IN THE </p><p>CONGO THAT AROUND 1,000 PEOPLE DIED THE WEEK BEFORE IN WHAT </p><p>APPEARED TO BE ETHNIC MASSACRES, INCLUDING SUMMARY </p><p>EXECUTIONS.  RECOGNIZING THAT THIS VIOLENCE BROUGHT WITH IT </p><p>THE POTENTIAL TO REIGNITE MASSIVE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE </p><p>REGION, THE POPE URGED THAT "EVERY EFFORT AT RECONCILIATION </p><p>AMONG THE CONGOLESE, UGANDAN AND RWANDAN PEOPLES MUST BE </p><p>ENCOURAGED...WITH THE HOPE THAT FROM THESE EFFORTS PEACE </p><p>WHICH IS SO DESIRED, CAN FLOWER." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IN HIS EASTER MESSAGE, THE POPE FOLLOWED HIS CALL FOR </p><p>PEACE IN IRAQ WITH A CALL FOR "PEACE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE </p><p>WORLD, WHERE FORGOTTEN WARS AND PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES ARE </p><p>CAUSING DEATHS AND INJURIES AMID SILENCE AND NEGLECT ON THE </p><p>    PART OF CONSIDERABLE SECTORS OF PUBLIC OPINION."  HE </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT THE AFRICAN CONTINENT "CANNOT BE ABANDONED TO </p><p>ITSELF." </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE VATICAN IS DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL </p><p>FOR RENEWED VIOLENCE IN AN ALREADY DEVASTATED REGION.  ADDING </p><p>TO THE POPE\'S WORRIES IS THE FEAR THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS </p><p>TAKEN FOCUS AWAY FROM THE VIOLENT CONFLICT IN AFRICA, AND </p><p>THAT WITHOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S COLLABORATION, A </p><p>TENUOUS PEACE WILL REVERT TO FURTHER ETHNIC SLAUGHTER.  THE </p><p>POPE\'S STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT REFLECTS THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR PEACE IN THE REGION, AND ITS DESIRE TO </p><p>ENSURE THIS CRISIS IS NOT FORGOTTEN IN THE GLOBAL FOCUS ON </p><p>IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01747 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
