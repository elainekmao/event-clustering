(sbu)  Jordanian Trade Minister Salah al Bashir asked the </p><p>Ambassador in a meeting on March 12 what requirements would </p><p>need to be met to allow USG agencies making procurements in </p><p>Iraq after a government change to procure goods and/or </p><p>services from Jordan (such as waivers of "buy America" </p><p>contracting provisions).  Bashir noted that Jordan has a </p><p>number of regional competitive advantages in several sectors, </p><p>and would be a natural fit for procurement for Iraq, owing to </p><p>the close historical ties between Jordan and Iraq.  He noted </p><p>further that, particularly in the services sector, Jordanians </p><p>were already employed throughout the region - as engineers, </p><p>architects, IT specialists, teachers, and medical staff. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  As examples of the types of goods and services </p><p>Jordan could provide, Bashir passed to the Ambassador a list </p><p>of goods produced for export in Jordan (also available on the </p><p>GOJ\'s Department of Statistics Website: www.dos.gov.jo) and a </p><p>list of key service sector exports, including:  medical </p><p>tourism; architectural and engineering consultancy; legal </p><p>services; teaching/education; audit and accountancy services; </p><p>software engineers/computer technicians; contract research </p><p>organizations (testing for pharmaceuticals); contracting </p><p>services; land transportation; and management consultancy. </p><p>(Note:  The embassy previously passed to Department reftel </p><p>list of Jordan\'s exports to Iraq for the past three years, </p><p>which may be a better gauge of immediate export potential. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Comment:  Iraq is a natural trading partner for </p><p>Jordan, and Jordan does, as the Minister pointed out, have an </p><p>excellent regional track record in the export of certain </p><p>services.  Jordanian contractors are currently reliable </p><p>supporters of  U.S. government activities in Jordan.  Jordan </p><p>is also an FTA partner, a front-line supporter of our </p><p>counter-terrorism program, and a key ally on many regional </p><p>policies.  To the extent that USG sourcing from Jordan was </p><p>possible, any such business would not only benefit both </p><p>countries at a technical level, but would likely more quickly </p><p>develop normal commercial relations between the two countries </p><p>and help the Iraqi private sector get back on its feet.  It </p><p>would also signal out continued commitment to Jordan\'s </p><p>economic future. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Action Request:  Embassy would appreciate </p><p>Washington guidance regarding what possibilities exist for </p><p>procurement from Jordan.  What rules govern such procurement? </p><p> How could we accommodate Jordan\'s request? </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
