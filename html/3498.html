<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, PREL, PARM, CE, NO, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: PM ON COHABITATION:  "NOT LOOKING GOOD" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR E. ASHLEY WILLS.  REASONS 1.5 B </p><p>, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  PM WICKREMISINGHE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT </p><p>(AUGUST 13) THAT COHABITATION TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH AND THAT </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE "NOT LOOKING GOOD".  HE </p><p>PROFESSED TO BE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>MENTAL BALANCE.  WHEN TOLD THAT SHE WILL BE COMING TO </p><p>JEFFERSON HOUSE TONIGHT FOR DINNER, HE ASKED ME TO CALL HIM </p><p>AFTERWARDS TO GIVE HIM MY OPINION OF HER FRAME OF MIND.  I </p><p>SAID I WOULD DO SO.  IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, SEVERAL VIP\'S IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT ONLY WE CAN </p><p>BROKER A DEAL BETWEEN THE PM AND PRESIDENT, AN IDEA I HAVE </p><p>RESOLUTELY DISMISSED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>COHABITATION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AT MINISTER GL PEIRIS\'S 56TH BIRTHDAY PARTY LAST </p><p>NIGHT (AUGUST 13), I HAD A FIVE-MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH PM </p><p>WICKREMISINGHE. IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION, HE SAID </p><p>COHABITATION WAS NOT GOING WELL AND THAT THE PROSPECTS ARE </p><p>"NOT LOOKING GOOD".  HE STRESSED TWICE THAT HE IS READY TO </p><p>TRY TO MAKE IT WORK BUT DOUBTS CBK FEELS RECIPROCALLY.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT FORMER FM KADIRGAMAR HAS BEEN TRYING TO BROKER </p><p>A DEAL BETWEEN HIM AND THE PRESIDENT BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS. </p><p>KADIRGAMAR TOLD HIM FRIDAY THAT HE WOULD ARRANGE A </p><p>FACE-TO-FACE MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO PRINCIPALS BUT HAD SO </p><p>FAR FAILED TO DO SO.  HE HAD CHECKED WITH KADIRGAMAR TWICE </p><p>OVER THE WEEKEND AND AGAIN YESTERDAY AND LEARNED THAT HE </p><p>(KADIRGAMAR) HAD NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO HER YET.  SHE </p><p>HAS NOT RETURNED EVEN HER FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER\'S CALLS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PM PROFESSED TO BE SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT HER </p><p>MENTAL BALANCE.  AMONG OTHER REASONS FOR HIS WORRY IN THIS </p><p>REGARD, HE ASSESSED THAT HER FLIRTING WITH THE MAOIST JVP, </p><p>WIDELY REPORTED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, NOT </p><p>ONLY WENT AGAINST THE NATION\'S INTEREST BUT HER OWN PARTY\'S </p><p>AS WELL.  (WE AGREE).  GL PEIRIS, WHO WAS STANDING WITH US, </p><p>THEN MENTIONED THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE COMING TO DINNER </p><p>TONIGHT AT JEFFERSON HOUSE.  THE PM BRIGHTENED.  HE ASKED </p><p>WHOM ELSE I HAD INVITED (I TOLD HIM CBK HAD INFORMED ME THAT </p><p>I SHOULD INVITE HER BROTHER, HER SISTER AND HER SON, A </p><p>20-YEAR OLD VET STUDENT IN THE UK; MY WIFE AND 20-YEAR OLD </p><p>DAUGHTER, WHO WRONGLY SUSPECTS A MATCHMAKING ATTEMPT ON HER </p><p>FATHER\'S OR THE PRESIDENT\'S PART, AND EMMA -- MY NON-GOLDEN, </p><p>NON-RETRIEVER -- WILL JOIN ME ON THE US SIDE, AGAIN A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL STIPULATION).  HE THEN ASKED WHETHER I WOULD </p><p>CALL HIM AFTER THE DINNER OR TOMORROW WITH MY ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>HER MOOD.  I SAID I WOULD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS THE CONVERSATION ENDED, THE PM AND PEIRIS </p><p>EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT GOES </p><p>ALONG, THE GOVERNMENT NOW BELIEVES IT HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO </p><p>PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT LIMITING HER POWERS TO </p><p>DISMISS PARLIAMENT.  THIS HAS BEEN THE KEY ISSUE IN </p><p>COHABITATION FOR THE UNF BECAUSE IT FEARS CBK WILL PROROGUE </p><p>PARLIAMENT AT HER EARLIEST CONVENIENCE SOMETIME AFTER </p><p>DECEMBER 6.  THAT DATE CONSTITUTES THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE SITTING OF THIS PARLIAMENT;  ACCORDING TO THE SRI </p><p>LANKAN CONSTITUTION, THE PRESIDENT CAN DISMISS PARLIAMENT </p><p>AFTER IT HAS SAT ONE YEAR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PM, HIS </p><p>CABINET OR A MAJORITY OF MP\'S WOULD AGREE.  FOR THE SAKE OF </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT\'S STABILITY AND LONGEVITY, RANIL WANTS EITHER </p><p>TO GET HER WRITTEN, SIGNED COMMITMENT NOT TO EXERCISE THIS </p><p>POWER FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OR TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO </p><p>ELIMINATE HER ABILITY IN THIS AREA EXCEPT IN VERY SPECIAL </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  OR BOTH.  THE MEDIA THIS MORNING ALSO REPORT </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT FEELS THAT IT HAS THE VOTES TO PASS THE </p><p>AMENDMENT (A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY WOULD BE NEEDED TO PASS IT </p><p>SO THERE WILL HAVE TO BE ROUGHLY 20 DEFECTIONS FROM CBK\'S PA </p><p>TO REACH THE MAGIC FIGURE OF 150 </p><p>VOTES). </p><p> </p><p>US ROLE?  NO WAY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL </p><p>IMPORTANT FIGURES IN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS THAT A US ROLE </p><p>WILL IN THE END BE NECESSARY TO BROKER A DEAL BETWEEN RANIL </p><p>AND CHANDRIKA.  SUCH IS THE EXASPERATION PEOPLE FEEL WITH </p><p>COHABITATION TENSIONS WHEN THE NATION\'S FUTURE IS AT STAKE, </p><p>SUCH IS A CERTAIN CULTURAL INCLINATION TO LOOK TO OTHERS TO </p><p>SOLVE SRI LANKA\'S PROBLEMS, AND SUCH IS THE CONFIDENCE IN THE </p><p>US THAT THIS IDEA HAS ACQUIRED TOO MUCH CURRENCY.  TWO UNF </p><p>MINISTERS, AN EDITOR AND SEVERAL BUSINESS EXECUTIVES </p><p>APPROACHED ME LAST NIGHT ALONG THESE LINES.  I RESOLUTELY </p><p>DISMISSED THE IDEA.  MY LINE IS THAT THIS MAY CONSTITUTE A </p><p>"DAMNED IF WE DO, DAMNED IF WE DON\'T" SITUATION, AND IF SO WE </p><p>PREFER TO BE DAMNED FOR NOT BUTTING IN TO THAT EXTENT.  IT </p><p>WOULD  BE INTERVENTIONIST, I SAY, AND IT WOULD LEAD </p><p>INEVITABLY TO OUR BROKERING EVERY TIME DISAGREEMENTS ERUPT. </p><p>BESIDES, I POINT OUT, A DEAL, IF ONE IS TO BE DONE, MUST </p><p>ARISE ORGANICALLY FROM THE PRINCIPALS IF IT IS TO LAST.  I </p><p>NEVERTHELESS REPORT THE FOREGOING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE </p><p>FRUSTRATION AND EVEN DESPERATION MANY PEOPLE FEEL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) I WILL CALL KADIRGAMAR TODAY TO GET HIS VIEW.  I MUST </p><p>SAY I FACE TONIGHT\'S DINNER WITH TREPIDATION.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>COULD WELL BE IN A BAD MOOD.  AND HER BRAT BROTHER ANURA HAS </p><p>BEEN MAKING VERY IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS LATELY, INCLUDING </p><p>ONE IN WHICH HE ACCUSED PRESIDENT BUSH OF HAVING "STOLEN" </p><p>2000\'S ELECTION.  I PREDICT MY SELF-CONTROL WILL BE TESTED. </p><p>SO WILL EMMA\'S.  SHE SNIFFS OUT INSINCERITY IN A JIFFY.  (CAN </p><p>DOGS BE NOMINATED FOR STATE DEPARTMENT AWARDS?) </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
