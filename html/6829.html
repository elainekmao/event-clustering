<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 13 (3/26 1915 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) CAIRO 2311 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy continued on a normal schedule throughout </p><p>March 26.  Consular services were open.  Activities at the </p><p>American Language Center and Peace Corps Office remain </p><p>suspended.  Movements for American staff remain restricted. </p><p>A freezing rain fell on Amman all day today, keeping most </p><p>people off the streets.  We received no reports from PSD of </p><p>any demonstrations today. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  FonMin Muasher\'s personal assistant confirmed to the </p><p>A/DCM today that, contrary to information contained in ref a, </p><p>Muasher did not/not attend the March 24 Arab League </p><p>Ministerial in Cairo.  Jordan was represented by its </p><p>Ambassador to Egypt and Representative to the AL, Hani </p><p>al-Mulki. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (sbu) The Jordanian American Business Association (JABA), </p><p>the AmCham in Jordan, agreed at a Board of Directors meeting </p><p>Tuesday to temporarily close its office for security reasons. </p><p> While JABA officials said there had been no specific threat </p><p>against the organization, the bombing Monday of British </p><p>Council offices in Beirut raised some concern among the </p><p>members.   The office is located in the Shmeisani </p><p>neighborhood in Amman, the site of some recent </p><p>demonstrations.  However, American fast-food restaurant </p><p>owners reported that Monday\'s anticipated march on the </p><p>restaurants (Amman 1800) never materialized, perhaps, they </p><p>said, due to the cold weather. </p><p> </p><p>6. (sbu) Banks and capital markets continue to observe no </p><p>unusual activity.  The Amman Stock Exchange was up .49% today </p><p>in normal trading.  A local financial market participant told </p><p>econoff that, for now, investors were trying to conduct </p><p>"business as usual" despite being bombarded by news and </p><p>events that were at times "overwhelming",  and that the </p><p>market is still hoping for a short war.  Airport authorities </p><p>said that traffic was getting back to normal, although there </p><p>is no service at present to or from Kuwait.  Jordan Telecom </p><p>said that both the mobile and fixed-line networks were </p><p>operating smoothly, and that, in fact, the company was </p><p>installing additional phone lines at the camps near </p><p>Ruweished. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) sent a two truck </p><p>convoy (driven by Jordanian nationals) into Iraq at 0900 </p><p>local time March 26.  MSF sent convoy information to the HOC, </p><p>OCHA and DART/Amman.  We passed the information to </p><p>appropriate military officers and the HOC.  MSF was advised </p><p>that the road was not secure and that travel at this time </p><p>would be extremely dangerous.  MSF elected to proceed.  The </p><p>Iraqi side of the border is controlled by Iraqi officials, </p><p>who allowed the convoy to enter Iraq.  The convoy\'s </p><p>destination is Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) IOM reports that there were no/no arrivals at the </p><p>Iraq-Jordan border over the last 24 hours.  There are </p><p>currently 169 TCNs resident in the transit camp.  Still no </p><p>sign of Iraqi refugees/asylum seekers. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Horrible weather conditions (50-km/hr winds, rain & </p><p>sandstorms) have ground IOM repatriation efforts to a halt. </p><p>IOM reports that TCNs are unable to even open their tents </p><p>without the tents blowing over.  The rubhall and several </p><p>unoccupied tents have blown away.  IOM and the Jordan Red </p><p>Crescent are trying to fortify tents and have requested 1,000 </p><p>additional spikes from UNHCR.  IOM canceled today\'s planned </p><p>repatriation of five Sudanese nationals and will not </p><p>reschedule until weather conditions improve. </p><p>10. (SBU) UNRWA and IOM officials confirmed that the 20 </p><p>Palestinians previously held at the no-man\'s land at the </p><p>border were moved into the transit camp on March 25.  Two </p><p>members of the group are Jordanian citizens but have elected </p><p>to stay with their families in the transit camp until their </p><p>situation is resolved.  UNRWA visited the group yesterday and </p><p>determined that 1 person does not qualify as an UNRWA </p><p>refugee, while 1 clearly qualifies.  The other cases are </p><p>under review.  UNRWA cautioned, however, that UNRWA refugee </p><p>status will not affect the Palestinians\' ability to enter </p><p>Jordan -- that decision is up to the GOJ immigration </p><p>authorities alone.  GOJ authorities have indicated to UNRWA </p><p>and IOM that they plan to hold the Palestinians in the </p><p>transit camp indefinitely. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (sbu)  Jordan papers were dominated by lead articles </p><p>rejecting Iraqi charges against Jordan and columns defending </p><p>the country\'s record as pro-Arab.  Other editorials </p><p>reiterated their belief that the quick coalition victory that </p><p>some expected has not been achieved because Iraqis are </p><p>defending their homeland while American and British soldiers </p><p>are only "fighting for oil." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
