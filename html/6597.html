ARMITAGE, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) PARTICIPANTS: </p><p> </p><p>U.S. </p><p>---- </p><p>THE DEPUTY SECRETARY </p><p>EUR DAS BOGUE </p><p>ALBANIA DESK OFFICER GREGORY (NOTETAKER) </p><p> </p><p>ALBANIA </p><p>------- </p><p>AMBASSADOR FATOS TARIFA </p><p>DCM RUDINA MULLAHI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ/NANO VISIT </p><p>=============== </p><p>2. (C) DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE, ACCOMPANIED BY EUR DAS </p><p>BOGUE, GAVE AMBASSADOR TARIFA A WARM RECEPTION. THE </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY SAID PRIME MINISTER NANO\'S FEB. 9 LETTER </p><p>TO THE BOSTON GLOBE, INVOKING AMERICA\'S SACRIFICES AT </p><p>NORMANDY, HAD "TOUCHED A CHORD." HE CALLED PARLIAMENTS\' </p><p>UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION ON MARCH 6 "COURAGEOUS." AMBASSADOR </p><p>TARIFA ASSURED DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE THAT ALBANIA\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR AMERICA ON IRAQ WAS NOT FOR POLITICAL </p><p>EXPEDIENCY, BUT CAME FROM THE HEART, AS A RESULT OF </p><p>"KNOWING WHAT LIVING UNDER A DICTATORSHIP REALLY MEANS." </p><p>HE SAID THAT 75 SOLDIERS WERE BEING SENT TO KUWAIT, AND </p><p>MORE WERE BEING TRAINED FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>COALITION. (NOTE: AMBASSADOR TARIFA\'S INFORMATION MAY NOT </p><p>BE CURRENT. ALBANIA IS COORDINATING WITH CENTCOM AND THE </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY IN TIRANA ON ALBANIAN PARTICIPATION (REFTEL). </p><p>END NOTE.) THE DEPUTY SECRETARY PREDICTED THAT NON-ARAB </p><p>MUSLIM COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE A VALUABLE ROLE TO PLAY IN THE </p><p>POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE PREDICTED THAT U.S.- </p><p>ALBANIA RELATIONS WOULD CHANGE, BOTH MILITARILY AND </p><p>POLITICALLY, BECAUSE OF ALBANIA\'S POSITIVE ACTIONS. </p><p>AMBASSADOR TARIFA EMPHASIZED THAT, IN ADDITION TO ITS </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ARTICLE 98 </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO MAKE PROGRESS ON </p><p>RULE OF LAW ISSUES, INCLUDING BRINGING CORRUPT OFFICIALS </p><p>TO JUSTICE AND STOPPING TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE ADRIATIC. </p><p>HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD RECOGNIZE AND ENCOURAGE ALBANIA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS BY ACCEPTING A PRIME MINISTERIAL VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON. THE DEPUTY SECRETARY SAID HE SUPPORTED A </p><p>WASHINGTON VISIT BY PM NANO AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE HOPED THE MARCH 12 </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF SERBIAN PRIME MINISTER DJINDJIC WOULD NOT </p><p>EMBOLDEN DARKER ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY TO BE MORE VICIOUS AND </p><p>VIOLENT. THE U.S. SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS NOW </p><p>UNDERWAY IN SERBIA TO CHOOSE A NEW LEADER. HE AGREED WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR TARIFA\'S STATEMENT THAT DJINDJIC HAD BEEN A </p><p>CALMING INFLUENCE IN THE REGION, AND THAT THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION SHOWED HOW VULNERABLE PARTS OF THE BALKANS </p><p>REMAIN TO INSTABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>ADRIATIC CHARTER </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ON THE ADRIATIC CHARTER, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY </p><p>AGREED WITH AMBASSADOR TARIFA THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>THE BALKAN COUNTRIES TO WORK COOPERATIVELY. HE ASSURED </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THE DEPARTMENT WAS WORKING TO IDENTIFY AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE DATE TO ENABLE THE SECRETARY TO SIGN THE </p><p>CHARTER FOR THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TARIFA JOKED THAT </p><p>ALBANIA, CROATIA AND MACEDONIA WERE "TAKING THE TRAIN TO </p><p>BRUSSELS TOGETHER." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
