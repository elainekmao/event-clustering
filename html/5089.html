(C) Post delivered reftel demarche to Jose Herran-Lima, </p><p>Director of DFAIT\'s South American Division, and Renata </p><p>Wielgosz, DFAIT\'s Inter-American Affairs Division Director, </p><p>on January 10.  Wielgosz indicated Canada is very interested </p><p>in joining in discussions concerning Venezuela on the margins </p><p>of the presidential inauguration in Ecuador, and that Canada </p><p>also wants to participate in the "Friends of Venezuela" group </p><p>being organized by Brazil.  The reftel talking points will be </p><p>given to the members of Canada\'s delegation, Senator Daniel </p><p>Hayes and Ambassador to the OAS Paul Durand. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Canada agrees that any "Friends of Venezuela" group </p><p>that is organized should be limited to OAS member states. Dr. </p><p>Wielgosz voiced some reservations about the composition of </p><p>the OAS group suggested in reftel - the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, </p><p>Canada and Chile. She believes the group should include Peru, </p><p>and one of the Caribbean nations. For such a group to have </p><p>any effect, she emphasized, it must be one that Secretary </p><p>General Gavira feels comfortable with. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
