(U) The UAEG announced that it has extended the </p><p>amnesty period for illegal aliens to depart the </p><p>country without penalty an additional month. (See ref </p><p>A).  The four month amnesty period was scheduled to </p><p>end on April 30, but officials have given illegal </p><p>aliens until May 31 to leave the UAE. The official </p><p>Ministry of Interior announcement declared, "Due to a </p><p>large increase in illegal entrants applying at </p><p>immigration offices to leave the UAE and because of </p><p>humanitarian reasons, the cabinet decided to extend </p><p>the amnesty by one month until the end of May."  Local </p><p>press emphasized the humanitarian angle of the </p><p>decision, extensively quoting laudatory statements </p><p>from diplomats whose nationals are the primary targets </p><p>of the amnesty -- Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri </p><p>Lankans and Indians. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment:  Not withstanding any official </p><p>statements about the humanitarian nature of the </p><p>extension, the amnesty has failed to live up to </p><p>expectations and the UAEG had little recourse but to </p><p>extend it in the hopes that more illegals would leave </p><p>the country.  (See ref B). During the original four </p><p>month period, only 66,595 illegals applied for amnesty </p><p>-- far less than the expected 200,000-250,000. A one- </p><p>month extension will have no significant impact on the </p><p>overall numbers unless and until the UAE demonstrates </p><p>-- as it has yet to do -- that it is serious about </p><p>cracking down on illegals.  For many illegal </p><p>expatriates here, the penalty for being caught outside </p><p>the amnesty program is little different from the terms </p><p>of the amnesty -- detention, deportation and a ban on </p><p>returning to the UAE to work. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
