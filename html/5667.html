During January 2003, the World Food Programme </p><p>(WFP) distributed 42,428 metric tons (MT) of food </p><p>commodities, more than doubling the total distribution </p><p>for December 2002.  The distribution reached 3.216 </p><p>million beneficiaries in 47 of 49 targeted districts. </p><p>In February, WFP plans to target 4.251 million </p><p>beneficiaries with 53,562 MT of food commodities.  WFP </p><p>reports that it will have sufficient food commodities </p><p>to meet distribution requirements through the end of </p><p>March 2003 when the beneficiary population is </p><p>projected to be 5.0 million.  WFP reports improved </p><p>cooperation with the Government of Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe </p><p>is expected to open a second border crossing with </p><p>South Africa in mid-February exclusively for </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  Due to logistical </p><p>constraints, it is increasingly unlikely that WFP will </p><p>mill US-donated maize in Harare.  The United States </p><p>remains the largest single donor to the WFP emergency </p><p>operation in Zimbabwe.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>WFP DOUBLES DISTRIBUTION QUANITY IN JANUARY </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  During January 2003, WFP and its implementing </p><p>partners (IPs) distributed a total of 42,428 MT of </p><p>food commodities for 3.216 million beneficiaries in 47 </p><p>of 49 targeted districts in Zimbabwe.  The January </p><p>distribution was WFP\'s largest to date, and more than </p><p>double December\'s 21,067 MT.  The current distribution </p><p>was able to reach almost 1 million more beneficiaries </p><p>than the December distribution.  The total tonnage </p><p>distributed during January consisted of 32,932 MT </p><p>maize, 1,436 MT vegetable oil, 3,437 MT beans, and </p><p>3,843 MT corn-soy blend (CSB). </p><p> </p><p>3.  NOTE:  According to the Zimbabwe Vulnerability </p><p>Assessment Committee\'s December Report, there are 5.9 </p><p>million rural Zimbabweans in need of food assistance. </p><p>WFP has assumed responsibility for covering food aid </p><p>needs in 49 of Zimbabwe\'s 57 rural districts.  The </p><p>total population in need in these 49 districts is </p><p>about 5.1 million people.  Of the remaining eight </p><p>districts, seven are covered by the USAID-funded </p><p>Consortium for the Southern Africa Food Security </p><p>Emergency (C-SAFE), and one is covered by Save the </p><p>Children, United Kingdom.  The total population in </p><p>need in these eight districts is about 0.8 million. </p><p>END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>BENEFICIARY TARGETS AND PROJECTIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  In late December, WFP projected that the January </p><p>distribution would reach 4.1 million beneficiaries </p><p>with 54,334 MT of food commodities.  Therefore, for </p><p>January, the WFP distribution was 12,000 MT and </p><p>900,000 beneficiaries below its target.  WFP missed </p><p>its target primarily because of a logistical </p><p>bottleneck at the South Africa - Zimbabwe border </p><p>crossing at Beitbridge.  Commodities arriving from </p><p>South Africa were delayed due to insufficient customs </p><p>clearance capacity during the 2002 holiday season.  In </p><p>addition, during January, some of WFP\'s IPs continued </p><p>to register beneficiaries for assistance.  In two </p><p>districts, Gokwe North and Goromonzi, no distribution </p><p>was possible because the IPs responsible for these two </p><p>districts had not yet finished the registration </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>5.  For February, WFP plans to target 83 percent of </p><p>the total rural population in need, that is, 4.251 </p><p>million beneficiaries of the estimated 5.1 million.  A </p><p>total of 53,562 MT of food commodities is projected to </p><p>be distributed in all 49 of WFP\'s targeted districts. </p><p>In March, WFP plans to target 5.0 million </p><p>beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD PIPELINE STRONG THROUGH END OF MARCH </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP projects that it will have sufficient food </p><p>commodities to provide a complete ration to all of its </p><p>targeted beneficiaries through the end of March 2003. </p><p>While WFP will retain the current ration of 10 </p><p>kilograms (kg) of cereals and 0.6 kg vegetable oil per </p><p>person per month (pppm), they hope to raise the beans </p><p>ration from 1.0 to 1.8 kg pppm in March.  By March, </p><p>WFP intends to stop general distribution of CSB in </p><p>favor of a program of targeted supplementary feeding </p><p>in all districts for selected vulnerable groups </p><p>implemented.  WFP is currently identifying additional </p><p>partner organizations to implement the supplementary </p><p>feeding program. </p><p>7.  WFP\'s current emergency operation (EMOP) 10200.0 </p><p>ends at the end of March 2003.  The EMOP is expected </p><p>to be extended by three months, until the end of June </p><p>2003.  In May, in expectation of the maize harvest, </p><p>WFP projects that it will cut its beneficiary </p><p>population to 3.0 million from March\'s high of 5.0 </p><p>million.  Resources pledged to date indicate that </p><p>WFP\'s cereal pipeline remains strong through the end </p><p>of April, and the vegetable oil pipeline remains </p><p>strong through the end of June.  WFP will require </p><p>additional pledges of cereals, pulses, and CSB to meet </p><p>beneficiary requirements through the end of June.  WFP </p><p>projects a shortfall of some 50,000 MT of cereals, </p><p>15,000 MT of pulses, and 20,000 MT CSB through the end </p><p>of June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN BRIDGE TO OPEN AT BEITBRIDGE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP has reached agreement with the Government of </p><p>South Africa and the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) to </p><p>reopen the old bridge over the Limpopo River at the </p><p>Beitbridge border crossing.  The bridge will be used </p><p>for humanitarian purposes only and is expected to </p><p>greatly reduce the time required for humanitarian </p><p>assistance to cross the border. The bridge is expected </p><p>to be opened late-February 2003 following completion </p><p>of an access road being constructed by the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP has deployed a full-time expatriate logistics </p><p>officer to work at the Beitbridge border crossing. </p><p>The logistics officer reports good cooperation with </p><p>GOZ authorities and that average commercial crossing </p><p>time has been reduced to ten hours from three days </p><p>during December. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>HARARE MILL UNLIKELY TO OPEN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Due to concerns about US-donated biotech maize, </p><p>the GOZ continues to require WFP to mill the maize </p><p>prior to distribution.  WFP is currently milling </p><p>11,000 MT of US maize per month in Bulawayo and 8,000 </p><p>MT per month in South Africa.  Because of the higher </p><p>cost of milling in South Africa, WFP has been </p><p>negotiating with the GOZ to open additional milling </p><p>capacity in Harare.  The Harare mill has the capacity </p><p>to mill 23,000 MT of maize per month.  WFP reports </p><p>that it has received preliminary authorization from </p><p>GOZ to begin milling in Harare, but due to logistical </p><p>capacity limitations, is unlikely to be able to </p><p>utilize the Harare mill.  From mid-February, WFP will </p><p>compete with the South African sugar industry for </p><p>access to the closed rail wagons which the GOZ </p><p>requires for the import of US-donated maize.  WFP </p><p>expects that it will be not be able to source enough </p><p>rail wagons to supply the Harare mill with a </p><p>sufficient quantity of maize to enable it to reopen. </p><p>With an existing milling capacity of 19,000 MT per </p><p>month without the Harare mill, WFP expects to mill all </p><p>remaining US-donated maize by the end of March. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CURRENT RESOURCES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Zimbabwe portion of WFP\'s EMOP 10200.0 for </p><p>Southern Africa has been 69 percent resourced.  As of </p><p>February 3, 2003, WFP had received commitments of </p><p>311,759 MT of food commodities, valued at over $150 </p><p>million.  The total appeal under EMOP 10200.0 was for </p><p>452,955 MT.  If WFP receives new commitments equal to </p><p>the 141,196 MT shortfall, WFP reports that it will </p><p>have sufficient commodities to meet beneficiary </p><p>requirements through the end of June 2003.  The United </p><p>States remains the largest single donor, pledging </p><p>136,873 MT, valued at about $67 million, towards EMOP </p><p>10200.0.  Since February 2002, the United States has </p><p>committed a total of 165,493 MT of food commodities to </p><p>WFP\'s two EMOPs 10200.0 and 10140.0, valued at more </p><p>than $82 million. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP has accepted a pledge of 100,000 MT maize </p><p>from South Africa for current food security crisis in </p><p>Southern Africa.  WFP expects that approximately </p><p>65,000 MT of this maize will be designated for </p><p>Zimbabwe.  South Africa, however, is not able to </p><p>provide the necessary funding to transport the </p><p>commodities to Zimbabwe or deliver them to the final </p><p>delivery points.  WFP is currently seeking donors to </p><p>fund the estimated $10 million required to import the </p><p>bulk maize.  If the South African contribution is </p><p>realized, this will increase EMOP coverage to 83 </p><p>percent and largely satisfy any outstanding maize </p><p>requirements through June 2003.
