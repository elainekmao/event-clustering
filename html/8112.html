<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000902 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRASER </p><p>CAIRO FOR JMAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, KISL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ZAK-ZAKY EMERGES FROM HIBERNATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Ibrahim el-Zak-Zaky, leader of a fringe </p><p>Nigerian Islamic sect calling for the return to </p><p>traditional Shi\'a principles, emerged over the weekend </p><p>from a period of inactivity.  Sheikh Zak-Zaky held a </p><p>fundraising event and public rally in Kano on May 10- </p><p>11, attracting some media attention and drawing </p><p>sizeable crowds of onlookers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ostensibly, the reason for his event was to </p><p>raise money for Islamic schools to provide "functional </p><p>education with sound Islamic background."  According </p><p>to the BBC, over 50 million Naira was collected during </p><p>the weekend events. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Emboff observed an estimated 100 vehicles </p><p>traveling in a motorcade in Kano shouting Zak-Zaky\'s </p><p>slogans.  Calling for an "end to democracy and </p><p>beginning of Islamic governance," the vehicles paraded </p><p>in this northern commercial center for more than two </p><p>hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Rendered irrelevant shortly after </p><p>the fall of the Abacha regime, Zak-Zaky has been </p><p>largely ignored due to his doctrinaire opposition to </p><p>the implementation of political shari\'a.  (NOTE:  He </p><p>claimed shari\'a was impossible without an Islamic </p><p>regime in place.  END NOTE.) He has always </p><p>concentrated on the social benefits of his brand of </p><p>Shi\'ism, so collecting money for Islamic education is </p><p>no departure.  (NOTE:  His children are said to attend </p><p>western-style private schools in Nigeria.  END NOTE.) </p><p>His appearance at this time is probably not a </p><p>coincidence.  Given the high level of dissatisfaction </p><p>with the recent elections, Zak-Zaky could attempt to </p><p>capitalize opportunistically on the disenchantment of </p><p>a susceptible segment of northern Nigeria\'s large </p><p>population.  Providing an alternative to the democracy </p><p>that has alienated them, Zak-Zaky\'s brand of </p><p>traditional Shi\'ism could appeal to some in Nigeria\'s </p><p>northern region who view critically the GON\'s failure </p><p>to provide infrastructure and social services. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
