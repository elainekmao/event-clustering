<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SOCI, YM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: CURBING VOLUNTEERS FOR IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 661 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES: AGMISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  Yemeni volunteers are being </p><p>discouraged by the ROYG from joining the Iraqis in fighting </p><p>against the coalition, although some volunteers will probably </p><p>continue to make their way to Baghdad from intermiediate </p><p>stops in Damascus and Amman.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Yemeni government in recent days has taken steps </p><p>to dissuade its citizens who wish to become "volunteer" </p><p>fighters in Iraq.  President Salih told Charge (reftel) April </p><p>5 that the flow of volunteers from Yemen -- as many as thirty </p><p>thousand, Salih claimed -- has been stopped.  Wire stories </p><p>also are reporting that Yemeni authorities are preventing </p><p>local volunteers from going to Baghdad to join the fight </p><p>against coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TDY Pol/Econ Counselor April 5 called on one of </p><p>Foreign Minister Al-Qirbi,s aides, Abdel Hakim Al-Iryani, to </p><p>underline USG views about Yemeni "volunteers" who may seek to </p><p>join Iraqi forces in fighting against the coalition. </p><p>Pol/Econ counselor noted we are expressing our view in </p><p>various Arab capitals that the safety of such volunteers is a </p><p>responsibility of their respective governments, and in the </p><p>event that volunteers join the fighting, they will be </p><p>considered as hostile elements.  He added that the whole </p><p>world had seen, on an Arab TV network that last week still </p><p>had correspondents in Iraq,  a large group of young men in </p><p>Baghdad, identified as Yemeni volunteers, waving rifles and </p><p>shouting pro-Saddam slogans. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Smiling at the reference to Al-Jazeera, Al-Iryani </p><p>said its correspondents have resumed working in Iraq.  He </p><p>added a "personal view" that the Yemenis in Baghdad who were </p><p>shown on Al-Jazeera had not in fact made the trip to Iraq for </p><p>the purpose of volunteering, but were drawn by the Iraqis </p><p>from a rather substantial number of pro-Baathi Yemenis </p><p>already in the country.  He suggested that the sympathies of </p><p>such Yemenis were already clear. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Marking further ROYG distance from sponsorship for </p><p>volunteers, Al-Iryani said  that Yemeni authorities had in </p><p>recent days stopped more than forty would-be volunteers from </p><p>leaving Yemen, once it was confirmed that their purpose was </p><p>to volunteer.  Opposition parties are sniping at the </p><p>government over this, he added.  The difficulty for the </p><p>Yemeni government, he said, was in determining the motives of </p><p>travelers.  There is a large number of Yemeni travelers going </p><p>to Damascus and Amman all the time, and the ROYG cannot </p><p>effectively sort out who is really going to volunteer -- but </p><p>if it finds out that is their purpose, they will be stopped. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Pol/ECON Counselor said that US-Yemeni cooperation in </p><p>fighting terrorism in continuing despite differing </p><p>perspectives of our governments about the war in Iraq.  It </p><p>would be unfortunate if some Yemeni volunteers were killed as </p><p>a result of engagement in hostilities in Iraq, and more </p><p>unfortunate if this led to unhappy families or vengeful </p><p>tribes who might take actions in Yemen contrary to our mutual </p><p>interests.  Referring to the volunteers, Al-Iryani replied </p><p>simply: They made their own choice. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: We are unable to estimate the number of </p><p>would-be Yemeni volunteers, but Salih\'s thirty thousand </p><p>figure (reftel) no doubt is hyperbole.  It is noteworthy that </p><p>the ROYG is actually stopping some volunteers, and to some </p><p>extent exposing its Arab flanks to opposition critics in </p><p>doing so.  As Al-Iryani pointed out, however, some Yemeni </p><p>travelers may still be finding their way to Baghdad, via </p><p>Damascus and Amman, without the ROYG\'s blessing or </p><p>protection. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
