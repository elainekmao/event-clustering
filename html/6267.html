<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 11: MARKETS QUIET, WEAK </p><p>DEMAND FOR DOLLAR BOND </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unsuccessful Dollar Bond Auction </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On March 11, Turkish Treasury auctioned a 546-day </p><p>dollar-denominated bond in the local debt market to weak </p><p>demand.  The annual yield - 6.88 percent - was below market </p><p>expectations, but the Treasury only succeeded in selling </p><p>$180.5 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment:  The debt redemption on March 12 is quite </p><p>small - TL 545 trillion (about $337 million).  The largest </p><p>redemption of the month is next week, with a payment of TL </p><p>5.2 quadrillion ($3.2 billion).   Thus, today\'s auction </p><p>doesn\'t help raise money for next week, and this will put </p><p>added pressure on the March 18 auction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment continued:  Local bond traders (Deutsche </p><p>Bank\'s Dilek Yardim) tell us the Turkish sovereign dollar </p><p>bonds are currently less attractive than lira-denominated </p><p>debt, with its 25 percent real interest rate.  This wasn\'t </p><p>always the case.  In 2001, when exchange rate risk was high </p><p>in Turkey, dollar bonds were quite attractive (and the yields </p><p>were 12-14 percent as compared with today\'s 7 percent.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Quiet, Waiting for the Erdogan GOT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Local financial markets remained in a waiting mode, </p><p>with T-bill yields unchanged at 56.5-57 percent compounded, </p><p>lira at TL 1,610,000 to the dollar and the stock exchange </p><p>down 0.8 percent in very light trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment: Markets are waiting for the formation of </p><p>the Erdogan government, with expectations still high that the </p><p>new GOT will move to pass a second resolution that unlocks </p><p>the U.S. package.  We are hearing rumors from multiple </p><p>sources that Erdogan might change several ministers, </p><p>including MinState for Treasury Ali Babacan.  We have no </p><p>confirmation of these rumors. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
