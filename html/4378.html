<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR OES/OA, L/OES, WHA/CEN, WHA/CAR, AND WHA/MEX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, ETRD, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS SUPPORTS MEXICO\'S CARIBBEAN MARITIME </p><p>BOUNDARY INITIATIVE; MFA GIVES UPDATE ON PENDING BORDER </p><p>DISPUTES </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 214982 </p><p> </p><p>1. PolOff discussed Mexico\'s Caribbean maritime boundary </p><p>initiative (reftel) November 5 with MFA DG for Foreign Policy </p><p>AMB Mario Fortin.  Fortin said that the GOH had attended the </p><p>first conference in May and welcomed the Mexican initiative. </p><p>(Fortin told PolOff November 18 that the GOH had "registered" </p><p>its Caribbean boundary disputes with Mexico.) </p><p> </p><p>2. Fortin said November 5 that with respect to Honduras\' </p><p>boundary dispute with Nicaragua, the GOH was only using the </p><p>International Court of Justice (ICJ) process, and not the </p><p>Mexican initiative.  Post notes that although the overall </p><p>issue of the Honduran-Nicaraguan Caribbean border is still </p><p>pending, the ICJ recently ruled in favor of the GOH\'s </p><p>petition against Nicaragua\'s 35 percent tariff on Honduran </p><p>imports. </p><p> </p><p>3. Fortin said that the GOH had negotiations underway with </p><p>Cuba and Jamaica on boundary disputes, had recently completed </p><p>negotiations with the United Kingdom on the Grand Cayman </p><p>Islands, and had helped support the OAS process of </p><p>negotiations between Guatemala and Belize. </p><p> </p><p>4. In addition, Fortin noted that the ICJ had yet to rule on </p><p>El Salvador\'s September 10 request for a revision of the 1992 </p><p>ICJ ruling that laid out shared areas of control in the Gulf </p><p>of Fonseca and established the land border between Honduras </p><p>and El Salvador. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
