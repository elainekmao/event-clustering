<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 000510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, NP, PGOV, MASS, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL ARMY CHIEFS DISCUSS ROLE OF THE ARMY AND </p><p>COUNTERING THE INSURGENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 379 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM HOZA.  REASON: 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p>SUMMARY: </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  RNA Chief General Rana and his deputy, Lt. General </p><p>Thapa, went out of their way to underline their support for </p><p>democracy at a February 28 dinner with emboffs.  Rana stated </p><p>unequivocally that a coup by the RNA was "out of the </p><p>question."   According to Rana, the RNA\'s role is to quell </p><p>the Maoist insurgencuy, to restore public confidence in the </p><p>GON\'s ability to provide security to its people, and to give </p><p>the GON an opportunity to address widespread poverty and </p><p>promote development.   His deputy, Lt. General Thapa, was </p><p>surprisingly optimistic in the wake of the debacle at </p><p>Mangalsen (Reftel A).  Thapa stated that the transition from </p><p>a "ceremonial and peacekeeping" military to a </p><p>counter-insurgency force would take time and that hard </p><p>lessons would be learned.  He noted that the RNA had enjoyed </p><p>several significant successes in the immediate aftermath of </p><p>the Mangalsen attack, particularly through the use of </p><p>helicopters.  Thapa stated that the RNA believes there is a </p><p>growing split between the political and military leadership </p><p>of the Maoists, and that the symptoms of that split include </p><p>greater violence and intimidation of civilians.  While </p><p>optimistic, Thapa made it clear that significant assistance </p><p>from "Nepal\'s friends" would be necessary.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>RNA CHIEF EMPHASIZES THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A COUP </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) Chief of Army Staff Gen. </p><p>Prajwalla Rana and Deputy Chief Lt. Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa took </p><p>the opportunity of an  RNA-hosted dinner to engage U.S. </p><p>embassy personnel on their view of the role of the RNA during </p><p>the current state of emergency in Nepal.  The dinner was in </p><p>honor of participants in the recent UN/PACOM-sponsored </p><p>peacekeeping seminar here in Kathmandu.  Both the Chief and </p><p>his Deputy went out of their way to underscore their views of </p><p>the current crisis, specifically discussing the RNA\'s </p><p>political perspective, prospects for operations against the </p><p>armed Maoist insurgency, and the need for material </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Chief of Army Staff Gen. Rana went to great lengths </p><p>to dispel fears of a coup by the RNA.   While forcefully </p><p>stating that "the politicians" must work together for the </p><p>good of Nepal, he was careful not to criticize the GON.  He </p><p>stated unequivocally that a coup by the RNA was "out of the </p><p>question" since the RNA cannot solve the country\'s problems. </p><p> The RNA could only rule through the imposition of martial </p><p>law, and that this would only worsen the country\'s economy </p><p>"even more than the current state of emergency."  Further, he </p><p>feared that a coup would immediately result in "the US </p><p>government and European governments withdrawing critical </p><p>development assistance."   Therefore, Rana concluded, it is </p><p>up to the RNA to neutralize the armed Maoists, to restore </p><p>public confidence in the ability of the soldiers and police </p><p>to provide security to the people, and give the GON an </p><p>opportunity to address the serious development issues </p><p>confronting the country.  He made it clear that the object of </p><p>the RNA-Maoist conflict would be to encourage Maoists to </p><p>surrender or defect, that the winning of hearts and minds was </p><p>more important than the number of Maoists killed, and that </p><p>the RNA must conduct a clean war with respect for human </p><p>rights uppermost. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Rana spoke with emotion regarding the RNA\'s critical </p><p>role in the restoration of public order in the immediate </p><p>aftermath of the palace tragedy of June 1, 2001.  If ever </p><p>there had been a moment when the RNA could have taken power, </p><p>said Rana, "that was it."  However, he said, the RNA had done </p><p>its duty to the King and the Nepalese people, maintained </p><p>public calm, returned the streets to the police, and returned </p><p>the troops to their barracks.  Since then, Rana continued, </p><p>the RNA has stood by the GON when its visible security </p><p>presence foiled the Maoist call for a mass rally in Kathmandu </p><p>in September 2001.  Since the attack on the RNA barracks in </p><p>Dang in November, the RNA has been forced to engage the </p><p>Maoists directly, but has only done so under a formal state </p><p>of emergency properly established through constitutional </p><p>mechanisms.   Rana noted that the RNA would far prefer seeing </p><p>the Maoists surrender as they "do not want to kill them - </p><p>they are Nepalis."  Rana spoke sincerely about the deplorable </p><p>poverty, particularly in the countryside, and the need for </p><p>development to improve the lives of the people. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  BACKGROUND NOTES ON CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF RANA: </p><p>Rana is a third generation army officer who began his career </p><p>in 1961.  He was a young lieutenant in 1964 when the </p><p>then-King dissolved the first democratic government and </p><p>instituted the Panchayat system.  In 1990, when demonstrators </p><p>forced the King to re-institute multi-party democracy, Rana </p><p>was Director of Military Intelligence.  It is reported that, </p><p>in the face of the popular demonstrations, the RNA had </p><p>advised the King that they could suppress the demonstrators, </p><p>that the soldiers would indeed follow orders, but that it </p><p>would cost over a thousand Nepali lives.  The King relented, </p><p>but not before at least forty demonstrators were killed by </p><p>the police, backed by the RNA, at one demonstration  in front </p><p>of the palace.  That event is often referred to as a searing </p><p>experience for the RNA, and one that prompted the King, up </p><p>until the time of his death last June, to keep the RNA away </p><p>from the conflict against the Maoists.  Gen. Rana is </p><p>scheduled to retire in September 2002, although rumors have </p><p>arisen that he might be kept on.  He is expected to be </p><p>replaced by his well-regarded deputy, Gen. Thapa. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>RNA DEPUTY CHIEF SURPRISINGLY OPTIMISTIC </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Despite the psychological impact of the recent Maoist </p><p>victory over the RNA reinforced platoon in Mangalsen, Deputy </p><p>Chief of Army Staff Lt. General Thapa was surprisingly </p><p>optimistic about the RNA\'s prospects for eventual success in </p><p>quelling the armed Maoist insurgency.  In a wide-ranging </p><p>discussion, Thapa outlined RNA operational thinking as they </p><p>make the transition from a "ceremonial and peacekeeping" </p><p>military to a counter-insurgency force.  "We will lose a few, </p><p>and we will win a few," he stated, but the RNA is engaged and </p><p>will make the transition necessary to defeat the armed </p><p>Maoists.  Expanding on Rana\'s comments, Thapa stated that the </p><p>RNA must maintain pressure on the Maoists, attack their </p><p>morale, and encourage defections.  Thapa was optimistic about </p><p>the prospects of severely degrading the Maoist military </p><p>capabilities before the start of the monsoon in June.  At </p><p>that point, he said, operations will necessarily slow down </p><p>due to the weather, and it will be "up to the politicians" to </p><p>resolve the conflict.   "If they fail, then we will be back </p><p>at work after the monsoons." </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>MANGALSEN WAS A SETBACK, BUT LESSONS ARE BEING LEARNED </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  When asked why the RNA was so optimistic only two </p><p>weeks after the debacle at Mangalsen, Thapa made three </p><p>points.  First, the contingent in Mangalsen was not prepared </p><p>to defend itself.  "While we don\'t like to talk bad about the </p><p>dead, the commander made many mistakes."  He went on to say </p><p>that the garrison in Mangalsen had not prepared proper </p><p>perimeter defenses, whereas the recent successful defense of </p><p>a repeater tower by a similarly-sized garrison was a </p><p>testimony to the importance of proper tactical preparation. </p><p>The lessons of site selection, clear fields of fire, razor </p><p>wire and trip flares were now being systematically passed on </p><p>to all platoon and company commanders, according to Thapa. </p><p>Second, Thapa claimed that the Maoist attacks in Achham </p><p>district, including Mangalsen, were not a complete success. </p><p>He claimed that it was the Maoist intention to hold the </p><p>district capital for the entire day.  However, the Maoists </p><p>were surprised by the arrival of RNA reaction forces by </p><p>helicopter and were forced to leave the area in haste. </p><p>Similarly, the subsequent Maoist attack on the police post at </p><p>Salyan was disrupted by the arrival of an RNA helicopter. </p><p>Third, Thapa continued, since the attack at Mangalsen, the </p><p>RNA had achieved a number of successes throughout the country </p><p>and inflicted heavy casualties on "hard-core" Maoist cadre. </p><p>This was particularly true, he claimed, in the successful </p><p>ambush of forty-plus heavily armed Maoists trying to return </p><p>to Kalikot district from Achham.  According to Thapa, the RNA </p><p>had four transport helicopters and two \'gunships\' in the area </p><p>in preparation for a planned cordon and search operation. </p><p>When the RNA learned  that this Maoist contingent would be </p><p>entering a pass between the two districts, he said, the </p><p>cordon and search operation was called off and the force was </p><p>quickly deployed ahead of the Maoist line of march.  This </p><p>successful ambush, high body count, and recovery of </p><p>significant weaponry did much to restore RNA morale. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>THE RNA CAN WIN, BUT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE WILL BE NEEDED </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Thapa noted that more such raids will be conducted as </p><p>the RNA makes the transition to a counter-insurgency role and </p><p>takes the offensive.  It is difficult, however, because of </p><p>the shortage of troops and the fact that it will be many </p><p>months before the 5,000 new recruits can take the field.  He </p><p>stated that they are further handicapped by a shortage of </p><p>equipment that can make the difference, particularly </p><p>helicopters and the ability to fly them at night or in poor </p><p>visibility.  Thapa noted that the RNA had used what slim </p><p>resources it had available to contract with an Israeli </p><p>commercial firm to install some armor plating and fixed </p><p>machine guns on their existing "scout" helicopters.   Thapa </p><p>went on to say that he had recently had a meeting with the </p><p>Governor of the Central Bank to determine what further </p><p>financial resources will be available.  He declined to </p><p>comment on the specific outcome of that meeting, but clearly </p><p>intended to make the point that the GON Treasury is under </p><p>strain and that "assistance from Nepal\'s friends" would be </p><p>necessary. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - </p><p>THE RNA SEES SPLIT IN MAOIST LEADERSHIP AND SEEDS OF THEIR </p><p>DEFEAT </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>- - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Gen. Thapa confirmed the RNA\'s belief that there is a </p><p>significant split between the Maoist political leadership and </p><p>their military commanders in the field.  During the last few </p><p>weeks, he claimed, communications between Maoist forces in </p><p>the field and the political leaders have declined, and </p><p>disagreements between field commanders and political </p><p>commissars attached to Maoist military units has increased. </p><p>Thapa characterized the conversations as criticism by field </p><p>commanders that "they are doing all the suffering and the </p><p>political leadership is enjoying all the perks."  Thapa did </p><p>not specify whether his information came from actual </p><p>communication intercepts or prisoner interrogations.  He </p><p>insisted, however, that current intelligence has confirmed </p><p>earlier rumors, dating back to November, of a major </p><p>disagreement over the decision by the Maoists to abandon </p><p>negotiations and resume military operations.  He went on to </p><p>say that it is the RNA\'s assumption that this split has </p><p>widened over the past three months.  As a result, the Maoist </p><p>military campaign is now being directed to a large extent by </p><p>relatively young and aggressive field commanders with limited </p><p>intellectual, ideological, or policy grounding.  Symptoms </p><p>include increasing use of violent terror tactics, forced </p><p>recruitment, and an increasing disregard for the winning of </p><p>the hearts and minds of the civilian population.  In some </p><p>districts, according to the RNA, villagers are beginning to </p><p>flee the Maoists, and significant numbers of Maoist fighters </p><p>are becoming disaffected and may be vulnerable to </p><p>opportunities to defect to the GON. </p><p>10.  (C)  EMBASSY COMMENT:   Gen. Rana certainly said all the </p><p>right things, and, while not necessarily insincere, was </p><p>clearly playing to his audience.  While Rana avoided </p><p>criticizing "the politicians," many of his colonels, majors </p><p>and captains are openly critical of the GON and its perceived </p><p>failure, in twelve years of democratic governance, to address </p><p>the issues of poverty and corruption.  As for Gen. Thapa\'s </p><p>optimism, the RNA will be hard-pressed to overcome the Maoist </p><p>insurgency before the arrival of the monsoon in June. </p><p>Despite the possible rift in the Maoist leadership, the </p><p>political boss, Prachandra, has publicly called for a </p><p>five-day bandh or strike to begin on the second of April.  As </p><p>with the successful two-day bandh in February, the Maoists </p><p>may well be planning another major attack like that in Achham </p><p>to cow the populace into compliance.  Whether Thapa\'s troops </p><p>can prevent another defeat, or better yet, disrupt Maoist </p><p>preparations through offensive raids, remains to be seen. </p><p>Both Rana and Thapa are saying the things "Nepal\'s friends" </p><p>want to hear, and they may well be sincere about them.  They </p><p>will indeed need foreign assistance to disarm an increasingly </p><p>violent and ruinous Maoist insurgency.  Whether the GON can </p><p>capitalize on an RNA victory by addressing the very real </p><p>issues of poverty and corruption is a much larger question. </p><p>However, that question will not have a chance to be answered </p><p>unless the RNA can win this round. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
