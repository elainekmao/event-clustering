<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  ITALY\'S LOCAL ELECTIONS:  BERLUSCONI COALITION </p><p>BRUISED, BUT STILL STANDING </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ROME 2067 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is a joint Mission Italy cable. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  While no victory for the governing center- </p><p>right coalition, Italy\'s local elections do not signal </p><p>the imminent demise of the Berlusconi Government.  The </p><p>outcome offers a lesson, if one were needed, that in </p><p>coalition politics, unity counts:  The coalition that </p><p>holds itself together best wins.  The corollary is that </p><p>good-quality candidates are also important.  Results will </p><p>cause short-term disharmony within the coalition, but are </p><p>unlikely to prompt permanent fractures.  They have also </p><p>at least temporarily energized a center-left heretofore </p><p>characterized by messy public disunity, although it will </p><p>continue to face significant challenges stitching </p><p>together the kind of wide coalition -- including at least </p><p>elements of the far-left Communist Renewal -- needed to </p><p>return to power.  The elections are above all local, </p><p>without major implications for the next national campaign </p><p>or Italy\'s upcoming EU Presidency.  Nonetheless, they may </p><p>reflect dissatisfaction on the part of some center-right </p><p>or swing voters with slow Government progress to meet its </p><p>2001 campaign pledges.  E1ND SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Italy\'s local elections ended on June 8-9 with run- </p><p>off contests for the May 25-26 balloting and single-round </p><p>elections in the autonomous regions of Valle d\'Aosta and </p><p>Friuli Venezia Giulia (reftel).  The results are being </p><p>billed in the local media as a defeat for Prime Minister </p><p>Berlusconi\'s center-right coalition, with even pro- </p><p>government Berlusconi-family-owned "Il Giornale" </p><p>headlining "The Center-Right Succeeded in Losing."  The </p><p>center-right indeed took a hit, but a very brief abstract </p><p>of the numbers does not suggest devastation.  Indeed, as </p><p>the Forza Italia (FI) Chamber of Deputies party whip Elio </p><p>Vito (and subsequently many others in the coalition) </p><p>pointed out, the center-right actually obtained almost </p><p>one million more votes than the center-left. </p><p>_______________________________ </p><p> </p><p>-- Of 12 races for provincial president, seven went to </p><p>the center-left, and five to the center-right, a gain of </p><p>one (Rome) for the center-left. </p><p> </p><p>-- In mayoral races in nine provincial capital cities, </p><p>five went to the center-left, and four to the center- </p><p>right, again a gain of one for the center-left.  (Note: </p><p>This is far from a scientific sample of results of the </p><p>495 city council races up for grabs, but in our view, it </p><p>highlights the races which are somewhat more </p><p>significant.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The center right lost the regional presidency in </p><p>Friuli Venezia Giulia. </p><p> </p><p>-- Union Valdotaine won the Valle D\'Aosta regional </p><p>presidency.  Union Valdotaine is a local-issues party </p><p>whose parliamentarians occasionally side with the center- </p><p>left, but the race is not reflective of national inter- </p><p>coalition balance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A major factor contributing to sensational headlines </p><p>-- and admission within the Berlusconi coalition of the </p><p>need to step back and review results with an eye to what </p><p>went wrong -- is the loss of the two highest profile </p><p>races in overwhelmingly lackluster elections -- Rome </p><p>province and Friuli Venezia Giulia region.  Both losses </p><p>highlight the main lessons of the elections:  A winning </p><p>coalition must be united and should choose its candidates </p><p>carefully.  In Rome Province, the story is less that the </p><p>center-right lost than that its victory in 1996 was </p><p>something of a miracle.  (Rome historically votes left.) </p><p>The coalition\'s victory in 1996 and defeat this year can </p><p>be attributed in large part to its cohesion in the former </p><p>and its lack thereof in the latter elections.  (A similar </p><p>picture emerged in Sicily.)  With this loss confirmed </p><p>after the May 25-26 first round, the coalition\'s second- </p><p>largest member, National Alliance (AN, Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Fini\'s party), of which the losing regional </p><p>president was a member, was in the lead calling for a </p><p>coalition review.  In Friuli, Umberto Bossi\'s Northern </p><p>League pushed for, and obtained, coalition backing for </p><p>its candidate, Alessandra Guerra, rather than sticking </p><p>with the incumbent regional president.  (As in the U.S., </p><p>incumbents have a distinct advantage in Italian local </p><p>elections.)  The center-left ran the well-known former </p><p>Mayor of Trieste (and coffee magnate; his name appears on </p><p>cafes and coffee packages throughout Italy) Riccardo </p><p>Illy.  Illy won -- and Bossi\'s League is for the moment </p><p>out-shouting AN in its calls for a coalition powwow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The significance of the electoral results should not </p><p>be overemphasized.  Given the limited weight of local </p><p>elections, it would be wrong to view this as a center- </p><p>left breakthrough -- although it would be equally wrong </p><p>to deny the center-left its moment of glory for </p><p>maintaining coalition cohesion.  Historically the left, </p><p>with a disciplined party base, performs better in run-off </p><p>elections, which center-right voters tend to skip.  The </p><p>left is generally stronger in local elections, as well, </p><p>thanks to the same disciplined base and a tendency to </p><p>have stronger candidates at the local level -- probably a </p><p>chicken and egg phenomenon.  It is harder for the </p><p>disparate elements of the left and center to come </p><p>together on national issues -- reform of labor codes and </p><p>upcoming Article 18 referendum (septel) are examples. </p><p> </p><p>6.  It makes sense for the center-right to use the set- </p><p>back as impetus to reconsider the coalition and its </p><p>future.  While Claudio Scajola, FI election coordinator </p><p>and former Interior Minister, said these were "local </p><p>elections with many local factors," Union of Christian </p><p>Democrats of the Center (UDC) leader Marco Follini </p><p>admitted that the loss "indicates difficulty (within the </p><p>coalition).  There\'s no need to beat around the bush; we </p><p>need to discuss (the situation) with calm."  Besides the </p><p>obvious cracks in the coalition -- AN accusing the League </p><p>of lack of support in Rome; the League hinting at AN </p><p>betrayal in Friuli Venezia Giulia and Bossi again </p><p>threatening to withdraw; UDC and AN claiming a greater </p><p>voice based on their attractiveness at the polls -- there </p><p>are also signs that dissatisfaction with the GOI\'s </p><p>progress in fulfilling 2001 campaign pledges </p><p>(particularly pocketbook issues of economic reform and </p><p>tax cuts) may have dimmed the enthusiasm of center-right </p><p>voters.  The center-right has plenty to discuss, and some </p><p>of the debates may be noisy and public.  We predict, </p><p>however, that the coalition will not fracture, discipline </p><p>will be restored -- and the coalition will hold.  The </p><p>only potential impact on Italy\'s EU Presidency would be </p><p>to give economic reform issues, if the GOI concurs that </p><p>frustration with the pace of reform was a factor in its </p><p>poor showing. </p><p> </p><p>7.  One winner of the elections is Communist Renewal (RC) </p><p>and its leader, Fausto Bertinotti.  Given the imperative </p><p>for a tight coalition and a simple analysis of the </p><p>numbers, it should be clear to the center-left that it </p><p>cannot win nationally unless it attracts at least some of </p><p>the far-left voters Bertinotti represents.  Italian media </p><p>are already highlighting center-left efforts to court RC </p><p>with a view to national elections.  Its success in doing </p><p>so without alienating centrist voters, and its subsequent </p><p>ability to act cohesively, will be crucial to any hopes </p><p>the center-left coalition has of unseating Berlusconi. </p><p>Meanwhile, we still expect the next national elections to </p><p>be held in 2006. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02674 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
