<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 11685 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, US, UR, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOVIET FLIRTATION WITH SOMALIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS LONDON UK 281549Z SEP 88 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (LOU) WISH TO DRAW DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION TO </p><p>REF FBIS REPORT OF AN IZVESTIYA DISPATCH DATELINED </p><p>MOGADISHU "WARM WIND IN THE HORN OF AFRICA".  PIECE </p><p>IS CLEARLY A SCENE-SETTER FOR CURRENT (AND LONG- </p><p>POSTPONED) VISIT OF SOVIET ECONOMIC DELEGATION </p><p>THAT ARRIVED HERE WITH MUCH HOOPLA LAST WEEKEND. </p><p>IZVESTIYA CLAIMS THAT THERE IS WIDESPREAD </p><p>ENTHUSIASM IN SOMALIA FOR A REVIVAL OF CLOSE </p><p>SOMALIA-SOVIET RELATIONS AND NOSTALGIA FOR THE </p><p>\'70S WHEN THESE TIES WERE VERY CLOSE.  ESPECIALLY </p><p>NOTEWORTHY IS THE CORRESPONDENT\'S INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SAMANTAR, CONDUCTED IN RUSSIAN, </p><p>IN WHICH SAMANTAR FONDLY RECALLS THOSE GOOD OLD </p><p>DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (LOU) WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION SO FAR </p><p>ON HOW TALKS ARE GOING BETWEEN SOVIET DELEGATION </p><p>AND SOMALIS.  WE KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT IN ADDITION </p><p>TO PREDICTABLE CALLS ON AGRICULTURE AND PLANNING </p><p>MINISTERS, DELEGATION PAID A SPECIAL VISIT TO </p><p>SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>FOR TALKS WITH DE FACTO PARTY BOSS ABDULKADIR </p><p>HAJI MOHAMED. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  AS WE MIGHT HAVE PREDICTED, </p><p>SOVIETS SUCCEEDED IN TIMING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR </p><p>DELEGATION TO COINCIDE WITH PERIOD OF SEVEREST </p><p>STRAIN BETWEEN PRESIDENT SIAD AND HIS WESTERN </p><p>FRIENDS, MOST NOTABLY OURSELVES.  IT WILL BE </p><p>RECALLED THAT THIS VISIT HAS BEEN "IMMINENT" FOR </p><p>NEARLY NINE MONTHS.  WHILE SOVIET EMBASSY DOWNPLAYS </p><p>ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO US, AT LEAST SOME SOMALIS ARE </p><p>POINTING TO IT AS AN INDICATION OF CRISIS IN </p><p>U.S.-SOMALI RELATIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DELEGATION\'S CALL AT PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>SEEMS AN UNUSUAL MOVE TO US FOR A MISSION WHOSE </p><p>OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE IS STRICTLY ECONOMIC.  WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CRIGLER </p><p></p></div>
