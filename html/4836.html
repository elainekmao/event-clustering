<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 009080 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR THE SENIOR ADVISOR TO PM A/S, PM/B, AND EUR/SE </p><p>DOD FOR OSD/PA&E, OASD/ISA/EUR, OASD/ISA/NP, OASD/ISA/AP, </p><p>OASD/ISA/NESA, OASD/ISA/BTF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, PREL, TU, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON TURKISH CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>TO THE COMMON DEFENSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 219916 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is Embassy Ankara\'s submission to the 2002 Report to </p><p>Congress on Allied Contributions to the Common Defense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = </p><p>General Assessment </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Turkey experienced a major political change in 2002 </p><p>when the governing coalition of Prime Minister Ecevit began </p><p>to dissolve in July, and November general elections brought </p><p>to power the Islam-influenced AK Party in a majority (vice </p><p>coalition) government.  The outcome of the election was </p><p>viewed as a public outcry against the often corrupt and </p><p>ineffective parties that have rotated through government </p><p>since the late 80\'s.  The AK Party\'s defense and security </p><p>policies are still somewhat unclear, but the Turkish General </p><p>Staff (TGS) is certain to maintain its significant influence </p><p>in the National Security Council and provide consistency to </p><p>Turkey\'s defense and security policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Throughout the political debate Turkey experienced </p><p>in the last half of 2002, the GOT continued to negotiate a </p><p>participation agreement in the EU\'s ESDP in exchange for </p><p>assured access to NATO planning assets.  The negotiations </p><p>culminated in an agreement in December that allows NATO and </p><p>the EU to proceed with "Berlin Plus" arrangements.  Turkey </p><p>has committed forces to the ESDP\'s Headline Goal and </p><p>encouraged the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" to </p><p>continue UN-brokered negotiations in hopes of resolving the </p><p>Cyprus problem to improve Turkey-Greece/Turkey-EU relations </p><p>and further its goal of becoming an EU member. In December </p><p>2002, the EU committed to reviewing Turkey\'s compliance with </p><p>the Copenhagen Criteria in December 2004 in order to begin </p><p>accession negotiations thereafter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Turkish General Staff (TGS) continues to support a </p><p>military modernization program that should increase the </p><p>capacity of Turkey to meet its NATO responsibilities. </p><p>However, the GOT\'s ability to finance its previously </p><p>announced 30-year, USD 150 billion program remains seriously </p><p>hampered by the government\'s precarious financial situation, </p><p>particularly an enormous public debt load that siphons off </p><p>most revenues.  Under the best of circumstances, maintaining </p><p>solvency will require the government to live within a very </p><p>tight budget for the next several years.  This has limited </p><p>and will continue to limit funds available for new military </p><p>spending.  If Turkey is able to achieve growth of 5 percent </p><p>or more beginning in 2003, there should be room for some </p><p>minor increases in defense spending, but the military will </p><p>face competition for budget resources from social programs, </p><p>which are on the top of the new government\'s agenda. </p><p>Turkey\'s 2002 National Defense Budget was reportedly $4.7 </p><p>billion, based on an exchange rate of $1=1.65 million Turkish </p><p>Lira, representing 8.5 percent of the national budget and 3 </p><p>percent of GNP.  (The defense budgets in 2000 and 2001 were </p><p>$6.6 billion and $4.3 billion respectively.)  Approximately </p><p>25 percent of the defense budget is allocated for personnel </p><p>expenditures.  The Defense Industry Support Fund, which is </p><p>independent of the defense budget (and not made public), was </p><p>expected to reach $.7-$1 billion when including funds carried </p><p>over from 2001.  Of that amount 90 percent was intended for </p><p>procurement projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In this fiscal environment, TGS has continued its </p><p>indefinite postponement of 32 projects, including 20 </p><p>utility/heavy-lift helicopters and the Turkish main battle </p><p>tank program, which was planned to replace Turkey\'s legacy </p><p>tank fleet.  TGS is now focusing on upgrading its M-60 fleet </p><p>and has awarded the modernization contract to the Israeli IMI </p><p>consortium.  The Turkish Attack and Reconnaissance Helicopter </p><p>(ATAK) direct commercial sale (DCS) project has been delayed </p><p>but is still in the contract negotiating phase.  Although US </p><p>Bell-Textron was selected as the primary candidate for the </p><p>project, the negotiations were stalled at year\'s end.  The </p><p>GOT started formal negotiations with the secondary contractor </p><p>(the "Kamov" Israeli/Russian Defense Industry consortium) in </p><p>2002.  The Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) DCS </p><p>project has experienced delays, but the contract has been has </p><p>been awarded, the US Congress has agreed to the contract, and </p><p>the project is expected to proceed successfully.  The GOT has </p><p>received and is evaluating contractor proposals to procure </p><p>eight strategic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) but is </p><p>expected to defer announcing down selection or awarding the </p><p>UAV contract until well into FY03. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On July 11, 2002 Turkey and the US signed a $175 </p><p>million Memorandum of Understanding for Turkish partnership </p><p>in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Systems Development and </p><p>Demonstration (SDD) Phase.  As a Level III partner, Turkey </p><p>will participate with the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, </p><p>Canada, Denmark, and Norway.  Over the next 10 years of the </p><p>SDD phase, Turkey\'s investment will enable it to share in the </p><p>technological exchange that marks this program as the largest </p><p>investment in research and development that Turkey has made </p><p>to date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Throughout the reporting period, the GOT continued its </p><p>support of UN and NATO humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts. </p><p> Furthermore, the Turkish-American "strategic partnership" </p><p>dramatically broadened and deepened in 2002, beginning with </p><p>Turkey\'s agreement to take over from the UK as the lead of </p><p>the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in </p><p>Afghanistan and continuing with the ongoing discussions over </p><p>the future of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Turkey officially took over leadership of ISAF in June </p><p>for a six-month term due to expire in mid-December and has </p><p>since agreed to extend its leadership until mid-February 2003 </p><p>to give Germany and the Netherlands time to prepare for the </p><p>role.  Ankara continues to place emphasis on stability in the </p><p>Caucasus and central Asia, committing approximately $30 </p><p>million over the last five years to upgrading the Georgian </p><p>military\'s ability to maintain control of its territories. </p><p>TGS continues to coordinate security assistance to the </p><p>Caucasus with the US through the OSD-led Caucasus Working </p><p>Group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Turkey\'s contributions to the war on terrorism have </p><p>been substantial.  The GOT\'s long-time leadership in the area </p><p>of counterterrorism and consistent support of US efforts </p><p>since 9/11 have underscored its role as one of the United </p><p>States\' key allies.  Its strategic location and distinction </p><p>as the only Muslim NATO Ally have further demonstrated </p><p>Turkey\'s importance to the US and NATO.  Turkey has </p><p>participated actively in GWOT.  In doing so, Muslim Turkey </p><p>has supported our message that GWOT is not a war on Islam. </p><p>In the aftermath of 9/11, the Turks issued strong public </p><p>statements condemning the attacks, and, in the face of </p><p>considerable public opposition, pushed through a </p><p>parliamentary resolution authorizing the deployment of </p><p>Turkish troops abroad for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) </p><p>and the stationing of additional foreign troops in Turkey. </p><p>Turkey was one of the first countries to offer troops for </p><p>OEF. Turkey also streamlined customs procedures for equipment </p><p>used for OEF, granted blanket permission for US OEF aircraft </p><p>to operate and refuel in Turkish airspace (over 8,000 sorties </p><p>to date), dispatched liaison officers to CENTCOM, EUCOM and </p><p>to Kandahar, offered the use of additional air bases for </p><p>operations through Turkey, offered two KC-135 tankers in </p><p>support of air operations, and increased its force protection </p><p>posture at US military facilities in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = </p><p>Direct Cost-Sharing </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) In accordance with current bilateral agreements, the </p><p>USG has not sought a direct GOT contribution toward the costs </p><p>associated with the stationing of US forces in Turkey. </p><p>However, Turkey significantly increased its security presence </p><p>at all US facilities for approximately four months following </p><p>9/11, and the Turkish National Police provided unmarked cars </p><p>at all US living quarters for a period of time. </p><p>Additionally, on September 11, 2002, the GOT significantly </p><p>increased force protection with additional military and </p><p>police presence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = = </p><p>Indirect Cost-Sharing </p><p>= = = = = = = = = = = </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Turkey continues to play a major role in Operation </p><p>Northern Watch (ONW), which is mandated to enforce the no-fly </p><p>zone over northern Iraq.  Turkey\'s parliament renews its </p><p>legislative commitment to host ONW at Incirlik Air Base every </p><p>six months and remains a major ally, teamed with the US and </p><p>UK, in the critical UN-mandated mission.  Despite repeated </p><p>Iraqi threats of retaliation against Turkey and significant </p><p>lost trade, the GOT remains a strong supporter of ONW.  US </p><p>military aircraft do not pay landing fees in Turkey to land </p><p>at Turkish military air fields (estimated value: USD 2 </p><p>million) but do pay to land at commercial airfields. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Indirect cost-sharing in the form of foregone rent of </p><p>GOT-owned land and facilities used at no cost by the USG is </p><p>calculated as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Office of Defense Cooperation, Ankara </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Land (11,120 sq m of land valued at $18.30/sq m, based on </p><p>prevailing fair market value of land in that district) = </p><p>$216,113; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Prevailing fair market value of headquarters building </p><p>(5,500 sq m), motor pool and shop (620 sq m), and parking lot </p><p>(5,000 sq m) adjusted for inflation is $328,000/year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US-utilized land at Incirlik Air Base (all buildings and </p><p>facilities are built and paid for by the USG): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- 13,477,700 sq m at the fair market value of $6.47/sq m = </p><p>$87.201 million annually. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total Foregone Rent of GOT-owned land/facilities = </p><p>$87,745,113/year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Forgone Tax/Customs revenue: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>American military activities and personnel assigned to Turkey </p><p>are exempt from all income, corporate, stamp taxes and </p><p>customs duties.  The estimated forgone revenue is calculated </p><p>as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey-wide PX/Commissary sales, valued at over $23.3 </p><p>million annually, at an average VAT rate of 22 percent is </p><p>estimated to be $5.128 million annually; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Forgone customs duties on personal property, personal </p><p>vehicles, supply equipment, weapons and munitions, military </p><p>vehicles, and local purchases at an average VAT rate of 18 </p><p>percent is estimated to be in excess of $12.24 million </p><p>annually. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total Foregone Tax/Customs = $17.368 million </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = </p><p>Grant Aid, Peacekeeping, Humanitarian Assistance, Current </p><p>Contingency Operations, Counterproliferation, and Nuclear </p><p>Threat Reduction </p><p> = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Because of its cultural, historic, and even familial </p><p>ties to the Balkans, Turkey continues to be a supporter of a </p><p>robust Western presence in the former Yugoslavia.  Turkey </p><p>supports KFOR with a mechanized infantry battalion task force </p><p>of approximately 752 personnel.  It has supported SFOR since </p><p>1996, currently with about 498 people in a mechanized </p><p>battalion task force, with one company of the task force </p><p>assigned to the security of SFOR headquarters.  Turkey has </p><p>also assigned one frigate, three F-16 fighters, and one </p><p>minesweeping vessel that can be provided upon request for </p><p>support of SFOR and/or KFOR.  In FYROM, there is a 40-person </p><p>Turkish national support element.  Other Turkish involvement </p><p>in current peace operations include five observers in UNIKOM </p><p>(Kuwait), seven observers in UNIMOG (Georgia), 37 police </p><p>officers for IPTF (International Police Task Force in </p><p>Bosnia), and 18 observers for TIPH (Temporary International </p><p>Presence in Hebron), and ONW liaison officers.  Turkey has </p><p>committed up to five thousand troops to the EU\'s rapid </p><p>reaction pool, including one mechanized brigade, one F-16 </p><p>squadron, two C-130 or C-160 transport aircraft, two </p><p>frigates, one submarine, one support vessel, and one </p><p>amphibious ship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) By far the GOT\'s most substantial contribution to </p><p>peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance in this reporting </p><p>period was its leadership of ISAF from June 2002 to </p><p>mid-February 2003, involving the commitment of nearly 1400 </p><p>Turkish personnel and 150 vehicles to Afghanistan.  The </p><p>Turkish General Staff (TGS) estimates that ISAF leadership </p><p>costs Turkey approximately $9 million dollars per month.  In </p><p>addition to its ISAF leadership, Turkey played a leading role </p><p>in the training of the first national guard battalion and </p><p>donated uniforms and equipment for those 600 soldiers. </p><p>Turkey continues to coordinate closely with the USG in </p><p>providing additional training to the Afghan National Army. </p><p>On the humanitarian front, Afghan reconstruction projects </p><p>completed with Turkish assistance now total $2.8 million, and </p><p>the GOT has committed $1.5 million for 2003.  $4.5 million </p><p>has been set aside for possible future use.  Turkey is </p><p>focusing its reconstruction efforts in four areas: </p><p>healthcare, training, agriculture and gender issues projects, </p><p>such as those that address women\'s and children\'s issues. </p><p>Completed projects breakdown as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- $ 314,000 for medicine, medical supplies and equipment, </p><p>cash assistance to </p><p>hospitals; </p><p>-- $ 1,760,000 for training of doctors, diplomats, water </p><p>experts, teachers; </p><p>-- $ 200,000 for infrastructure (telephone network </p><p>installation); </p><p>-- $ 23,800 for baby food; </p><p>-- $ 608,936 cash to Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund </p><p>(ARTF) and early support to </p><p>the Afghanistan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) To pursue its goals of stability and westernization </p><p>in the region, Turkey provides military equipment, education </p><p>and training to personnel from Central Asia and the Caucasus, </p><p>especially Georgia, where it has committed over $30 million </p><p>dollars over the last five years. Some 30 Turkish military </p><p>advisors are in Georgia and have trained more than 400 </p><p>Georgian special forces and border guards.  TGS coordinates </p><p>with the US its assistance to the Caucasus and Kazakhstan </p><p>through the OSD-led Caucasus working group, which met three </p><p>times in 2002.  In 2002 Turkey provided training/education at </p><p>various Turkish military institutions to 1200 guest military </p><p>personnel from some 30 countries.  It has bilateral military </p><p>training, technical and scientific cooperation agreements </p><p>with almost 60 countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Turkey has actively supported the US in pursuing the </p><p>adaptation of NATO to a post-Cold War world.  Ankara has </p><p>expressed its support for the NATO Rapid Reaction Force, </p><p>niche capabilities, and missile defense.  Its commitment to </p><p>the Partnership for Peace is evident in its Ankara PfP </p><p>Training Center, which has trained more than 2200 students </p><p>from 45 NATO, PfP and Mediterranean Dialogue countries in </p><p>courses ranging from "Peacekeeping Operations Management" to </p><p>"Refugee Relief."  The GOT budget to support participants in </p><p>the PfP training center is approximately $150,000 per year. </p><p>During 2002, Turkey participated in 11 PfP or Spirit of PfP </p><p>exercises.  Furthermore, TGS has invested substantial </p><p>resources into renovating its 3rd Corps Headquarters in </p><p>Istanbul to make it suitable for hosting a NATO High </p><p>Readiness Force (HRF) Headquarters.  The Turks fully </p><p>supported NATO enlargement at Prague, particularly in </p><p>southeastern Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) Turkey has launched a number of groundbreaking </p><p>regional cooperation mechanisms in southeastern Europe.  It </p><p>continues to be an active participant in the South-East </p><p>European Cooperation Process (SEECP) and the numerous </p><p>initiatives that have emanated from it, including the South </p><p>Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG), an integrated infantry </p><p>brigade composed of units from Albania, Bulgaria, FYROM, </p><p>Greece, Italy, Romania, and Turkey, with the US and Slovenia </p><p>acting as observers.  Turkey contributes a mechanized </p><p>infantry battalion, a reconnaissance company, an artillery </p><p>battery and some supporting units to SEEBRIG.  In 1997-8, </p><p>Turkey conceived and nurtured the Multinational Peacekeeping </p><p>Force--Southeast Europe (MPFSEE), which operates the on-call </p><p>SEEBRIG.  It was activated in 1999 under a Turkish commander. </p><p> In 2001, the GOT successfully brought together Russia, </p><p>Ukraine, Romania, and Bulgaria to establish the BLACKSEAFOR, </p><p>an on-call force comprising naval units of the Black Sea </p><p>littoral states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Turkey is a vigorous supporter of regional </p><p>counterproliferation cooperation.  It is a member of every </p><p>major USG-endorsed arms control and counterproliferation </p><p>regime, including NPT (1969), BWC, (1974), Wassenaar (1996), </p><p>MTCR (1997), CWC (1997), CTBT (1999), NSG (2000), and </p><p>Australia Group (2000).  Since 1999, the GOT has undertaken </p><p>the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the </p><p>Belbasi Seismic Monitoring Station, an important data source </p><p>for the worldwide comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) </p><p>nuclear test-monitoring network.  During 2002, the GOT </p><p>finalized a project to install USG-donated radiation </p><p>detectors at Turkish border crossings.  The detectors are </p><p>intended to deter and, if necessary, interdict smugglers </p><p>trafficking in radioactive material that could be used by </p><p>terrorists or countries of proliferation concern to build </p><p>nuclear weapons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) Since February 1999, TGS and the US Missile Defense </p><p>Agency have been cooperating on a joint missile defense </p><p>architectural study in anticipation of a developing tactical </p><p>ballistic missile threat against Turkey and it NATO Allies. </p><p>Turkey has consistently supported US objectives for pursuing </p><p>missile defense for the Alliance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Point of Contact </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.
