(U) According to official figures, UAE oil exports to </p><p>Japan increased 20.6% in January 2003 from December 2002. </p><p>The Emirates thus officially became the top oil exporter to </p><p>Japan, shipping 1.05 million barrels per day (bpd), slightly </p><p>larger than the 1.02 million bpd sent from Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Almost one-quarter of Japan\'s oil imports now come from the </p><p>UAE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: The UAE actually exports more to Japan </p><p>than these figures indicate (supplies delivered as a </p><p>consequence of long-existing contracts are not reflected in </p><p>official figures, particularly as they would probably </p><p>indicate significant quota cheating by Abu Dhabi).  In any </p><p>case, we believe the UAE sends about two-thirds of its </p><p>exported oil to Japan, and Japan meets close to one-third of </p><p>its imported energy needs from UAE sources.  The bilateral </p><p>energy relationship is very close; most of Abu Dhabi\'s LNG </p><p>exports also go to Japan and the Tokyo Electric Power </p><p>Company -- TEPCO -- is an equity stakeholder in ADGAS, the </p><p>main LNG producer.  Yet despite continued close ties in </p><p>energy, Japanese companies have been notably unsuccessful in </p><p>parlaying trade into project awards.  Japan sells a large </p><p>number of vehicles and other durable goods in the UAE -- </p><p>particularly machinery and computers -- but Japanese firms </p><p>have been noticeably absent from large prestige projects in </p><p>the utility and construction sectors.  A number of our </p><p>Emirati interlocutors have remarked that while Japanese </p><p>firms come on strong in initial project presentations, they </p><p>do not follow-up as aggressively as their American, European </p><p>or Korean competitors and that -- in contrast to the past -- </p><p>Japanese companies no longer offer the sort of attractive </p><p>financing packages for which they used to be famous. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
