<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001119 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, P, AF/FO AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNAL MEDIATION EFFORTS BETWEEN MUGABE AND </p><p>TSVANGIRAI </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Joseph G. Sullivan for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (c) Father Fidelis Mukonori, who has been involved for </p><p>several years in mediation efforts between President Mugabe </p><p>and the MDC and who has a long-standing relationship with </p><p>Mugabe dating back to before independence, told the </p><p>Ambassador June 3 that Mugabe and Tsvangirai had agreed in </p><p>principle to a face-to-face meeting inside Zimbabwe, although </p><p>the   date had not yet been set. (MDC sources told us that </p><p>Mugabe had proposed that the meeting take place privately in </p><p>Mugabe\'s rural home and that Tsvangirai cancel planned </p><p>demonstrations.  The MDC tells us that Tsvangirai agreed to </p><p>cancel demonstrations, but only if the meeting took place </p><p>before June 2.)   Father Fidelis said that it had almost been </p><p>agreed to schedule the meeting the weekend prior to the MDC\'s </p><p>June 2 mass action, but that Mugabe had not wished the </p><p>meeting to be held under that time pressure.  Nonetheless, </p><p>Father Fidelis believed that he had Mugabe\'s agreement to </p><p>meet and that it should be possible to schedule the meeting </p><p>soon.  Fidelis Mukonori thought that a face-to-face meeting </p><p>would help ease tensions and assure that ongoing, quiet </p><p>contacts between ZANU-PF and the MDC were more successful. </p><p>He related that Tsvangirai had told him that Mugabe reminded </p><p>him of his father and that Mugabe had appreciated this </p><p>reference. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) Father Fidelis believed that Mugabe\'s resignation was </p><p>definitely on the table with the key issues being the </p><p>modalities and precise timing of the departure.  Fidelis </p><p>anticipated that it would be important to assure the immunity </p><p>and well-being of Mugabe and his family and that he be </p><p>treated with the dignity which Mugabe accorded Ian Smith. </p><p>Fidelis expected the December ZANU-PF Party Congress to </p><p>choose a successor, although he said the Congress could be </p><p>pushed up, after the Ambassador doubted that Zimbabwe could </p><p>continue in crisis that long.  Fidelis said that quiet </p><p>ZANU-PF/MDC contacts were continuing, including those between </p><p>Justice Minister Chinimasa and MDC Secretary General Welshman </p><p>Ncube, but that he believed a meeting at the top was needed </p><p>to give this a push. </p><p>Mukonori asked that the US be prepared to encourage dialogue </p><p>at the right moment. </p><p> </p><p>3.(c) Comment: In the last several months, numerous </p><p>Zimbabwean and international mediators have put themselves </p><p>forward.  Father Fidelis Mukonori has been at this for some </p><p>time and has a better-established relationship with Mugabe </p><p>than most others. Fidelis has in the past been guilty of </p><p>excessive optimism, but he now has had recent encouragement </p><p>from Mugabe to take up the mediating role again and Fidelis </p><p>does appreciate that Mugabe\'s retirement is the key to </p><p>resolution of the political crisis.  Mugabe has initially </p><p>welcomed and later stymied a number of mediation efforts in </p><p>recent months.  We are encouraged by the more personal </p><p>efforts of a Mugabe confidant, but will temper out optimism </p><p>until after a face-to-face meeting takes place. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
