<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 001848 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: (S/NF) IRANIAN PROTEST PLANNERS MEET WITH </p><p>DISSIDENT CLERIC </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (d) </p><p>and 1.6 (6) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Poloff spoke with Washington-based American-Iranian </p><p>activist Mark Namdar (strictly protect) on May 3, 2003.  Mr. </p><p>Namdar serves as an unofficial spokesman and intermediary for </p><p>U.S.-based Iranian student movement leader  and political </p><p>asylee Reza Mohajeri-Nejad.   Mr. Namdar claims that the </p><p>Iranian student group Students for Secular Democracy (Jonbesh </p><p>Daneshjooyan) is planning massive protests in Tehran for July </p><p>9 -- the anniversary of the 1999 demonstration and subsequent </p><p>regime crackdown at Tehran University -- to include </p><p>occupation of government ministries.  Mr. Namdar said </p><p>Students for Democracy leaders are expecting up to one </p><p>million protesters. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Although the group, made up of five separate </p><p>student organizations and headed by formerly imprisoned </p><p>student activist Heshmatallah Tabarzadi, is spearheading the </p><p>demonstrations, Namdar claims the organization has been able </p><p>to gather support from many segments of society, including </p><p>Basij forces and people close to President Mohammad Khatami. </p><p>In addition, Namdar claims Tabarzadi met with Ayatollah </p><p>Hossein Ali Montazeri four to five days ago to discuss how </p><p>Montazeri could be a "key figure in this process."   Namdar </p><p>could not provide any additional details about the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Asked why such a wide array of movements would be </p><p>working together, Namdar said that his contacts say people in </p><p>Iran are so frustrated by their current situation that, </p><p>despite political differences, they are willing to join hands </p><p>to try and "overthrow the government."  Namdar added that </p><p>Tabarzadi has contacts within police organizations and has </p><p>managed to convince them to put their weapons down when the </p><p>protests begin.  In addition, he claims that a large number </p><p>of Bazaari merchants have agreed to close their shops and </p><p>join the protests. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Despite efforts to gather support from all segments </p><p>of Iranian society, Namdar admits the planning efforts are </p><p>chaotic, mostly due to a lack of experience by many of the </p><p>groups involved.  However, he said he is optimistic that </p><p>organizing efforts for the protest are gaining  momentum, and </p><p>he has overcome his initial doubts about the effort.   Namdar </p><p>claims to have already met with VOA and NSC staff, and has an </p><p>appointment to meet with Iran Desk officers this week. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Comment: While post has not been able to </p><p>independently verify any of Mr. Namdar\'s claims, we thought </p><p>it best to pass on this information for the record. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
