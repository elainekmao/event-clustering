<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001742 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: ENCOURAGING BALANCED ARAB MEDIA COVERGE OF IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 199008 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmuind J. Hull, Reasons 1.5(b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1, (C) We totally agree with the Department\'s assessment of </p><p>the Arab media coverage of Iraq.  That picture is repeated </p><p>here in Yemen, with all media outlets, official and </p><p>independent, carrying similar tunes.  During the war in Iraq, </p><p>Ambassador and PAO Sana\'a made personal calls to the official </p><p>media and some independent media to ask for a more balanced </p><p>approach.  As a result, we witnessed a diminution of the </p><p>strident rhetoric we were seeing in some newspapers.  Our </p><p>latest attempt to place an Op-Ed article on some coalition </p><p>successes in Iraq bore fruit.  Six independent newspapers </p><p>carried the article and four newspapers commented on it </p><p>(septel). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We note however that it is not just the Arab media </p><p>that has been guilty of misrepresenting the facts or carrying </p><p>one-sided reports.  We have seen unbalanced and </p><p>sensationalized coverage on CNN and other American networks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In response to your latest call, we will expand our </p><p>aggresive campaign to ask for a balanced coverage of events </p><p>in Iraq.  Ambassador will emphasize progress in Iraq, e.g., </p><p>the formation of the Governing Council, in a series of media </p><p>interviews and make the points suggested in reftel during his </p><p>meetings with ROYG officials. PD section will meet with the </p><p>editors of all the media in Sana\'a starting week of July 20 </p><p>and, whenever possible, with editors in other cities, to </p><p>deliver the same message.  This method has worked well for us </p><p>in the past. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the meantime, we would welcome: (1) indications </p><p>that the security situation is improving in the country, (2) </p><p>indications that Iraqis are increasingly governing </p><p>themselves, (3) indications that daily life is improving for </p><p>the average Iraqi. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
