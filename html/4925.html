<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, SNAR, KDEM, PHUM, CASC, US, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: DRUGS, TRADE, AND HUMAN RIGHTS: AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST </p><p>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PORTILLO </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 3306 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Hamilton </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  At an informal dinner at the home of </p><p>President Portillo December 28 that also included FM </p><p>Gutierrez and the DCM, the Ambassador emphasize the need to </p><p>focus in Portillo\'s remaining year in office on being </p><p>recertified and on making progress in other areas -- human </p><p>rights, corruption and American citizen murder cases -- </p><p>which, left unattended, could endanger U.S. Congressional </p><p>approval of the CAFTA.  Although the conversation was civil, </p><p>Portillo was upset about Guatemala\'s impending </p><p>decertification, claiming it would weaken his ability to </p><p>govern effectively and undermine the "reformist" elements of </p><p>his government.  The Ambassador disagreed, indicating that it </p><p>was not the reformist elements that were being decertified. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)   President Portillo invited the Ambassador to an </p><p>"informal" dinner at his home before his presentation of </p><p>credentials ceremony, now set for January 8.  The backdrop </p><p>was the increasingly public USG criticism of the government </p><p>in the latter half of 2002.  In the two weeks before the </p><p>dinner, the local press had run stories based on two leaked </p><p>Guatemalan foreign ministry cables (from Brussels and </p><p>Washington) that, inter alia, reported that the USG was </p><p>weighing the cancellation of Portillo\'s visa and the </p><p>impending counternarcotics decertification of Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CAFTA AND DECERTIFICATION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  As it had been in a meeting the previous day with </p><p>the Foreign Minister (ref), the Ambassador\'s main message was </p><p>that time had run out on taking steps that could avoid </p><p>decertification.   The government needed to react, when the </p><p>announcement came, as positively as possible, making clear </p><p>its determination to win recertification by the time of the </p><p>next formal review process, in September.  The Ambassador </p><p>also emphasized that the government would need to make </p><p>progress in other areas -- human rights, </p><p>corruption/transparency, American Citizen murder cases and </p><p>the like -- which, left to fester, could endanger U.S. </p><p>Congressional approval of a CAFTA agreement.  The Ambassador </p><p>emphasized what an extraordinary opportunity CAFTA is for </p><p>Guatemala and Central America, offering the best </p><p>possibilities for reducing poverty and containing elements </p><p>that will strengthen transparency in all areas of government </p><p>having to do with trade.  Portillo professed to be a strong </p><p>believer in free trade, pointing to several tariff cuts that </p><p>had increased competition in formerly protected markets </p><p>(Comment:  his prime motivation for the cuts probably was to </p><p>attack opponents in the private sector).  The Ambassador </p><p>recapped his December 27 conversation with FonMin Gutierrez, </p><p>in which the latter described steps (ref) that the GOG would </p><p>take to strengthen its trade negotiating team, which the </p><p>Ambassador candidly told the President was the weakest in the </p><p>region.  Portillo, who showed no awareness we could detect of </p><p>the steps the FonMin had described (ostensibly with </p><p>Presidential approval), nodded his assent. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Decertification, the Ambassador said, was </p><p>essentially a done deal.  It would not be announced until </p><p>early to mid-January, but the decision had been objectively </p><p>based upon the GOG\'s performance, including the widespread </p><p>use by traffickers of the ports (comment:  this was a </p><p>deliberate zinger, as the President\'s personal secretary, </p><p>Julio Giron, exercises de facto supervision over ports), and </p><p>the poor performance against traffickers, including the </p><p>failed raid in Zacapa, which clearly was leaked by someone in </p><p>the GOG (comment:  another zinger).  Portillo\'s reaction to </p><p>the latter was to agree that the failed raid was a shame and </p><p>to suggest later in the conversation that the Public Ministry </p><p>was to blame. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  However, based on some recent positive steps the GOG </p><p>had taken, the Ambassador said, it was likely that, in the </p><p>absence of any egregious backsliding in the interim, the USG </p><p>would approve a national interest waiver for Guatemala, thus </p><p>avoiding any economic sanctions.  And, recertification during </p><p>2003 was a possibility, but one that the GOG must earn </p><p>through sustained, serious accomplishments.  They should </p><p>start by complying with our six benchmarks. But the GOG would </p><p>need to do much more to get recertified. (Note:  The </p><p>President was unaware that former FonMin Orellana had told </p><p>the Ambassador December 16 that his latest analysis was that </p><p>the President could order the extradition of Marin Castillo, </p><p>one of the six benchmarks for certification.  Gutierrez will </p><p>see where the decision memo is -- but this illustrates the </p><p>sloppy staffing of important issues in the GOG.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Ambassador said that decertification with a </p><p>waiver would permit CAFTA negotiations to begin with </p><p>Guatemala included (local rumor had Guatemala excluded) but </p><p>he said it was politically awkward to decertify a country and </p><p>begin free trade negotiations almost simultaneously.  That </p><p>was why he had suggested to the Foreign Minister that we meet </p><p>again in early January for a more structured discussion of </p><p>the steps the GOG would need to take to be recertified and to </p><p>clear the way for CAFTA approval.  Later in the dinner </p><p>Portillo asked how the USG had analyzed the likely political </p><p>consequences of decertification.  Would it increase or </p><p>decrease his ability to govern effectively?  Would it hurt </p><p>the traffickers or embolden them?  In his opinion, echoed by </p><p>the Foreign Minister, decertification would weaken the </p><p>reformist and positive elements in the GOG during the final </p><p>and hardest year of his administration and would actually </p><p>strengthen the drug cartels, whose beyond-the-reach-of-law </p><p>status would only become more obvious.  It would also become </p><p>a political issue, Portillo and Gutierrez admitted candidly, </p><p>during an election year. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Ambassador replied that we did not believe that </p><p>decertification would weaken the reformists.  They were not </p><p>the ones responsible for decertification.  Although the </p><p>opposition and press would seize upon decertification, the </p><p>GOG also had the opportunity to get recertified.  When </p><p>Portillo complained that the system of criminal justice was </p><p>penetrated and corrupted by the drug traffickers, tying his </p><p>hands, the Ambassador responded that one of the weaknesses </p><p>that puts the drug kingpins beyond reach is the lack of a </p><p>criminal conspiracy statute.  Portillo and Gutierrez reacted </p><p>positively to this, Portillo instructing Gutierrez to look </p><p>into it.  The Ambassador suggested the GOG could best exert </p><p>political damage control by reasserting its commitment to </p><p>fighting drugs and its determination to win recertification </p><p>through tough action.  It was in theory possible to win </p><p>recertification before the November elections.  Portillo said </p><p>the GOG would of course adopt the most positive public </p><p>posture possible, as it had no other choice. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Human Rights </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The Ambassador asked Portillo and Gutierrez why </p><p>there was an increase in threats against human rights groups. </p><p> Portillo asked Gutierrez to respond; the Foreign Minister </p><p>said the basic reason was that several of the human rights </p><p>groups were involved in prosecutorial investigations that put </p><p>at risk numerous former members of the military.  The latter </p><p>responded with the actions and threats of clandestine groups. </p><p> Portillo added noted that some in the international </p><p>community (comment:  an allusion to us) had called upon the </p><p>government to use military intelligence (D-2) against the </p><p>clandestine groups.  When previous governments had turned to </p><p>the D-2 to carry out police investigations, however, the </p><p>price was a lack of civilian control and human rights </p><p>violations.  The DCM responded that our proposal was for the </p><p>D-2 to provide only information to the appropriate police and </p><p>public ministry officials, nothing more; if the D-2 refused </p><p>to share such information, it certainly provided a test of </p><p>civilian control of the military.  Shifting subjects, the </p><p>President highlighted the impending reduction of some 150 </p><p>members (about 20 percent) of the EMP (Presidential Military </p><p>Staff), a long overdue Peace Accords requirement.  (Comment: </p><p>The President did announce this reduction the next day in the </p><p>six-year anniversary commemoration of the Peace Accords </p><p>(septel). </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Transparency </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The recently created Transparency Commission, </p><p>observed the Ambassador, was under considerable pressure to </p><p>resign due to the President\'s charging the Commission with </p><p>ensuring the transparency of the disbursement of funds to be </p><p>collected through the (controversial) 750 million dollar </p><p>Eurobond issue.  Could the President not assign this task to </p><p>some other entity, and allow the private and public members </p><p>of the Commission to focus on larger structural transparency </p><p>issues?  The President agreed that this was a possibility, </p><p>and that perhaps the GOG could instead use a private </p><p>verification service to perform these functions.  The </p><p>Ambassador then raised the lack of transparency and the size </p><p>of the military budget -- two items that went against the </p><p>Peace Accords, and also prevented the USG  -- along with </p><p>other problems -- from having a normal relationship with the </p><p>Guatemalan military.  Portillo agreed that the military </p><p>budget needed more transparency, and said he would explore </p><p>this (comment: a promise he has made before but never </p><p>followed through on).  He disagreed, however, that the </p><p>military budget had increased significantly in real terms </p><p>since 1996 (comment:  according to Minugua, the 2002 budget </p><p>is about 50 percent higher than the Peace Accords target of </p><p>0.66 percent of GDP). </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>American Citizen Murder Cases </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Ambassador said that, with another American citizen </p><p>murdered in December, eleven U.S. citizens had been murdered </p><p>in Guatemala in the last two years.  None has been solved. </p><p>It is impossible to explain and justify the lack of progress </p><p>in these cases to the families involved and to the Congress. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Election Observers </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Asked, Portillo told the Ambassador that the GOG </p><p>would once again invite international election observers for </p><p>the 2003 elections -- the campaign as well as election day </p><p>itself.  He urged the US to work with the Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal (TSE), which he described as new and inexperienced. </p><p>(Comment:  WHA DAS Fisk signed our assistance agreement with </p><p>the TSE in November.  Portillo\'s statement is positive in </p><p>terms of assuring that the elections are free and fair.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The meeting covered our most pressing issues with </p><p>the GOG, and initiated the working relationship between the </p><p>President and the Ambassador.  Portillo was polite and </p><p>responsive, but was uncharacteristically subdued.  He showed </p><p>little enthusiasm for his upcoming last year in office. </p><p>Portillo is a complex personality; part of his positive and </p><p>pragmatic side was to invite the Ambassador to this working </p><p>dinner before the credentials ceremony.  The decertification </p><p>decision, however, rankles him. He claimed that local </p><p>misinterpretation of A/S Reich\'s HIRC testimony cost him a </p><p>teaching job in Mexico after he leaves office in 2004 -- and </p><p>his tendency will be to respond to it negatively.  We will </p><p>keep working with FonMin Gutierrez to get the GOG to react in </p><p>the most positive way possible.  On CAFTA, the President was </p><p>relatively uniformed and unengaged.  He is probably </p><p>personally suspicious of any process that might provide </p><p>benefits to the private sector, in which a number of his </p><p>enemies work.  At the same time, he doesn\'t want to be left </p><p>behind by the rest of Central America.  All in all, not a bad </p><p>first meeting, but genuine progress in all the areas </p><p>discussed will not be easy. </p><p> </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
