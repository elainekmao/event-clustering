<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: AMBASSADOR RAISES U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>JORDANIAN MEDIA COVERAGE OF IRAQ WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030407000170 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>AMBASSADOR: JORDANIAN PRESS PRESENTS A BIASED PICTURE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The Ambassador raised with Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher April 8 continued U.S. concerns over the unbalanced </p><p>coverage in the Jordanian media of events in Iraq.  MFA </p><p>Officer Samer Dabbas and PolCouns also sat in.  The </p><p>Ambassador cited for Muasher several examples of factually </p><p>incorrect coverage in the Jordanian media of alleged </p><p>coalition military actions, as well as examples of a </p><p>distinctly pro-Iraq slant in coverage that is otherwise </p><p>factually true.  Such coverage only fans the flames of </p><p>anti-U.S. hatred and could make it more difficult for the </p><p>U.S. to sustain its important programs in the long term. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>MUASHER: LOCAL PRESS REFLECTS POPULAR ATTITUDES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Muasher said that he, too, is concerned with the </p><p>"hysterical" nature of the local press, not because it is </p><p>leading popular opinion, but rather because it reflects the </p><p>strong popular opposition to the war.  The GOJ has "done as </p><p>much as we can do" to influence the mostly-independent local </p><p>media coverage of Iraq through Jordan television and the </p><p>government-controlled al-Rai newspaper.  He noted, however, </p><p>that local Arabic papers had not picked up an interview he </p><p>had given April 7 in which he talked about post-war Iraq. </p><p>"It is too sensitive yet even to admit there will be a </p><p>different Iraqi government after the war."  He said the GOJ </p><p>remains seized with the task of managing public opinion in </p><p>the longer term. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. CAN DO THINGS TO CHANGE ARAB MINDS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Muasher admitted to personal concern over the </p><p>possibility that strongly negative anti-U.S. views could </p><p>affect U.S. programs in Jordan.  "I have never seen </p><p>anti-American feeling so strong."  The U.S. has the power, he </p><p>argued, to change public opinion by its actions.  He made </p><p>several suggestions. </p><p> </p><p>--  "Don\'t make this look like an occupation."  One statement </p><p>by a senior USG official about the need for a permanent </p><p>military presence in Iraq "can wipe out all the good </p><p>statements from President Bush and Secretary Powell" about </p><p>the U.S. desire to leave Iraq as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>--  Give the UN a role.  In the Arab world, Muasher argued, </p><p>the UN stamp on post-Iraq governance will convey a degree of </p><p>popular legitimacy that the U.S. and UK cannot.  (Note:  The </p><p>official news agency Petra carried reports of a visit by King </p><p>Abdullah to the Foreign Ministry April 7 (ref) in which the </p><p>King is quoted as asking Muasher to work to "prevent the USA </p><p>and Britain from administering Iraq\'s affairs alone."  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>--  Give Arabs a role as well.  Muasher recommended close </p><p>consultation with Arab governments leading to a turnover of </p><p>authority to a true Iraqi government "in a reasonable period." </p><p> </p><p>--  Make concrete progress on the MEPP.  Publication of the </p><p>roadmap is a "great" first step, but the U.S. will have to be </p><p>seen as pressing Israel to make concrete concessions in order </p><p>to win back any Arab public trust. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>JORDAN TO SEEK POST WAR CONSULTATIONS WITH U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Muasher said that he hopes to travel to Washington </p><p>to consult on post-war arrangement and MEPP issues soon after </p><p>the war ends.  King Abdullah also hopes to visit the U.S. at </p><p>an appropriate time in the not too distant future.  One of </p><p>the issues of importance to Jordan will be the role of INC </p><p>leader Ahmad Chalabi in post-war Iraq.  Chalabi, Muasher </p><p>said, is accused of serious financial crimes in Jordan, and </p><p>his presence in a senior position in a new Iraqi government </p><p>will cause serious problems for the GOJ. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  The GOJ hears and understands our concern regarding </p><p>unbalanced media coverage in Jordan.  It is a concern that -- </p><p>in their own interests -- they share themselves.  Their </p><p>willingness to challenge that coverage directly, however, is </p><p>circumscribed by the strong popular opposition to the war </p><p>which has inspired the coverage in the first place. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
