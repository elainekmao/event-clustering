<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 004625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, MARR, AF, IZ, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT OF GOI\'S PARLIAMENT\'S DEFENSE COMMITTEE </p><p>ON IRAQ, ITALIAN REINFORCEMENT OF OEF </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 183517 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON SEPTEMBER 23, PARLIAMENTARY DEFENSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04625  241753Z </p><p>COMMITTEE PRESIDENT LUIGI RAMPONI TOLD DCM THAT HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT UNSC MANDATED USE OF FORCE IN IRAQ WOULD HAVE </p><p>STRONG, ACROSS THE BOARD SUPPORT IN THE CHAMBER.  UNILATERAL </p><p>OR LIMITED COALITION ACTION WOULD, HOWEVER, NOT BE SUPPORTED </p><p>BY THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION.  RAMPONI SAID THAT ALPINI </p><p>TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO OEF WAS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF DEPLOYMENT </p><p>LEGISLATION PASSED LAST FALL, AND HE COULD NOT PREDICT THE </p><p>EXTENT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT FOR SUCH A </p><p>DEPLOYMENT. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN ANTICIPATION OF PARLIAMENTARY (CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES) DEBATE ON IRAQ SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 25, DCM </p><p>REINFORCED WITH RAMPONI USG VIEWS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>DISARMING SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND URGED RAMPONI TO DO WHAT HE </p><p>COULD TO SOLIDIFY SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT.  RAMPONI, A MEMBER </p><p>OF THE JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER NATIONAL ALLIANCE PARTY, SAID </p><p>THAT HE AGREED WITH THE USG POSITION, AND THAT THERE WAS </p><p>AGREEMENT FROM ACROSS THE ITALIAN POLITICAL SPECTRUM ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING WMD FROM SADDAM.  RAMPONI WILL MAKE A </p><p>SPEECH IN THE CHAMBER DURING THE SEPTEMBER 25 DEBATES, IN </p><p>WHICH HE WILL DRAW COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE CURRENT PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH IRAQ AND THE PRE 9/11 SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE WOULD CITE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS BY AFGHANISTAN IN 2000 AND 2001.  THE RESOLUTIONS </p><p>HAD CALLED FOR, INTER ALIA, HALTING AID TO TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND EXTRADITING OSAMA BIN LADEN.  HAD THE IC </p><p>BEEN MORE RESOLUTE IN ENFORCING THOSE RESOLUTIONS, SAID </p><p>RAMPONI, "WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A 9/11." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  RAMPONI SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS THE STRONG POSITION </p><p>THE U.S. HAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO PUSH THE UN TO ACTION AND TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04625  241753Z </p><p>"GET SOME ANSWERS" FROM SADDAM.  IF INSPECTIONS WORK, AND THE </p><p>IC HAS TOTAL ASSURANCE THAT IT HAS SADDAM\'S WEAPONS </p><p>PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES UNDER CONTROL, THEN PERHAPS WE CAN </p><p>AVOID WAR.  IF SADDAM DOES NOT COOPERATE, THE UNSC MUST </p><p>REACT.  THE USE OF FORCE UNDER A UN BANNER WOULD RECEIVE THE </p><p>SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT AS GIVEN TO </p><p>OEF.  HOWEVER, CONTINUED RAMPONI, IF THE U.S. GOES IT ALONE </p><p>OR WITH A SMALL COALITION, IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO SECURE </p><p>SUPPORT FROM THE MINORITY CENTER-LEFT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TURNING TO THE U.S. REQUEST FOR A BATTALION OF THE </p><p>GOI\'S ALPINI TROOPS TO BE DEPLOYED TO OEF, THE DCM REITERATED </p><p>THAT THE ALPINI WERE CAREFULLY SELECTED FOR THEIR EXPERTISE </p><p>BY CENTCOM STAFF.  FURTHER, OUR REQUEST FOR THE ALPINI TROOPS </p><p>IS NOT LINKED TO ANY POSSIBLE U.S. DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ. </p><p>RATHER, INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION IN OEF GROUND FORCE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT HAS DIMINISHED, TO THE POINT WHERE SOON ALMOST ALL </p><p>GROUND FORCES IN OEF WOULD BE U.S.  THE ALPINI DEPLOYMENT </p><p>WOULD HELP CORRECT THAT SITUATION AND MEET PREVIOUSLY </p><p>IDENTIFIED OEF REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RAMPONI SAID THAT THE ALPINI WERE WELL TRAINED IN </p><p>MOUNTAIN COMBAT TACTICS, BUT NOT IN COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>TECHNIQUES.  HE SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME DEBATE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT ABOUT THE DEPLOYMENT SINCE IT WOULD GO BEYOND THE </p><p>SCOPE OF OEF SUPPORT LEGISLATION PASSED LAST FALL. RAMPONI </p><p>COULD NOT PREDICT THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT FOR SUCH </p><p>A DEPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT.  WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE SUFFICIENT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR ALPINI DEPLOYMENT.  OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04625  241753Z </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH OFFICIALS FROM THROUGHOUT THE GOI INDICATE </p><p>THAT WHILE THE ALPINI DEPLOYMENT PROPOSAL MAY GENERATE SOME </p><p>DEBATE OVER THE NECESSITY OF PUTTING ITALIAN TROOPS IN HARM\'S </p><p>WAY, PM BERLUSCONI WILL HAVE THE NECESSARY VOTES TO MAKE GOOD </p><p>ON HIS PROMISE TO PRESIDENT BUSH TO DEPLOY ALPINI TROOPS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04625 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
