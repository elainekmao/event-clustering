SUMMARY.  ESTCOUNS AND SCI SPECIALIST VISITED THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF PADUA NANOTECHNOLOGY PROJECT, A FRAMEWORK </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP </p><p>AN INTERNATIONALLY-COMPETITIVE HIGH-TECH CLUSTER IN VENETO </p><p>(NORTHERN ITALY).  THE PROJECT, CO-FUNDED BY THE RESEARCH </p><p>MINISTRY, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INDUSTRY, IS BASED ON </p><p>LEADING RESEARCH FACILITIES, HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY AND A GOOD </p><p>NETWORK OF INVESTORS.  THE UNIVERSITY SHOWED GREAT INTEREST </p><p>IN COOPERATING WITH A US NANOTECHNOLOGY CENTER AND IN </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN A BILATERAL SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOP IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON OCTOBER 30, THE UNIVERSITY OF PADUA BRIEFED ESTCOUNS </p><p>AND SCI SPECIALIST ABOUT THE NANOTECHNOLOGY CLUSTER PROJECT </p><p>BY THE UNIVERSITY RECTOR MORANDINI, PROF. RENATO BOSIO, AND </p><p>SEVERAL CONSULTANTS FROM MCKINSEY.  THE IDEA OF A NANOTECH </p><p>CLUSTER WAS BORN AFTER A JOURNEY IN THE U.S. DURING WHICH </p><p>PADUA UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS VISITED UNIVERSITY-BASED </p><p>NANOTECH CENTERS.  THE PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED BY MCKINSEY AND </p><p>A FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT WAS REACHED.  THE RESEARCH MINISTRY </p><p>HAS ALREADY APPROVED CO-FUNDING OF THE PROJECT, AND THE </p><p>MINISTER IS EXPECTED TO SIGN THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT WITHIN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05589  01 OF 03  181437Z </p><p>NOVEMBER 2002.  THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO JUMPSTART A </p><p>"VIRTUOUS CIRCLE" AMONG DIFFERENT ACTORS, INCLUDING RESEARCH </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, EXISTING COMPANIES AND START-UPS, IN ORDER TO </p><p>ESTABLISH VENETO AS A REGION OF EXCELLENCE IN </p><p>NANOTECHNOLOGIES IN EUROPE.  ACCORDING TO THE PRESENTATION, </p><p>50 MILLION EURO WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2002 BUT THE </p><p>CLUSTER BUDGET IS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. </p><p>NOTE:  THIS WOULD BE THE SECOND HIGH-TECH CLUSTER FUNDED BY </p><p>THE RESEARCH MINISTRY; THE FIRST ONE IS THE INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY CLUSTER IN TURIN.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WHY NANOTECH IN VENETO? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  VENETO HAS BEEN ONE OF THE ENGINES OF ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LAST DECADES, WITH MANY SMALL AND MEDIUM- </p><p>SIZE COMPANIES FOCUSING IN EXPORTING NICHE TECHNOLOGIES. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE REGION HAS THE HIGHEST ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND </p><p>THE LOWEST FAILURE RATES IN THE EU.  AMONG ALL THE </p><p>INDUSTRIAL SECTORS LOCATED IN THE AREA, MORE THAN 50 PCT IS </p><p>DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY NANOTECHNOLOGIES APPLIED TO MATERIALS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, MANY COMPANIES ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF NANOCOMPONENTS, OR VERY </p><p>INTERESTED IN THEIR FUTURE APPLICATIONS.  RECENTLY, SOME </p><p>LOCAL ENTITIES TOGETHER WITH THE UNIVERSITIES OF PADUA AND </p><p>VENICE, LAUNCHED A PROJECT CALLED "NANO FABRICATION </p><p>FACILITY", ON THE FOOTPRINT OF WHAT ALREADY HAPPENED IN </p><p>CERTAIN U.S. UNIVERSITIES (E.G., CORNELL).  THE NFF MISSION </p><p>IS TO HELP LOCAL ACADEMIA AND COMPANIES TO INVESTIGATE AND </p><p>DEVELOP INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGIES.  IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05589  01 OF 03  181437Z </p><p>ADDITION TO THAT, THE NFF WILL TRAIN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND </p><p>RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEES OF INTERESTED COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SEVERAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING CARRIED </p><p>OUT IN THE AREA, SPANNING NANOTECHNOLOGY FOR MATERIALS, </p><p>NANOELECTRONICS, AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY.  TWO LOCAL </p><p>UNIVERSITIES, PADUA AND VENICE, AS WELL AS RESEARCH </p><p>INSTITUTES, HAVE MORE THAN 500 RESEARCHERS AND PHD\'S </p><p>CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO </p><p>NANOTECHNOLOGY, WITH EXCELLENCE IN THE AREA OF THE </p><p>PROPERTIES (STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL) OF MATERIALS. </p><p>REGARDING APPLICATIONS, NANOPARTICLE COATINGS FOR AUTO- </p><p>LUBRICATING SURFACES, FOR GOLD AND SILVER PROTECTION </p><p>(IMPORTANT TO JEWELRY PRODUCTION), AND VERY THIN LAYER </p><p>COATINGS FOR LIGHT-ABSORPTION IN GLASS ARE CURRENTLY BEING </p><p>DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS A LIGHTER AND MORE RESISTANT </p><p>NANOSTRUCTURED TEXTILE FOR MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING.  NOTE: </p><p>THERE IS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF METAL AND OF TEXTILE </p><p>INDUSTRIES IN VENETO, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON METAL </p><p>ALLOYS AND ANTICORROSIVE COATINGS.
