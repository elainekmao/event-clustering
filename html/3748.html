<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001740 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR: EBRYAN </p><p>DOC FOR JFERNANDEZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KTEX, EAID, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA PREPARES FOR POST-QUOTA WORLD </p><p> </p><p>Ref: (A) State 160692 (B) Colombo 671 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Well aware of the potential impact of the </p><p>expiration of the MFA on its number one export (apparel), </p><p>Sri Lankan players are beginning to explore their options, </p><p>ranging from special trade agreements with the US to </p><p>strengthening the domestic industry and diversifying the </p><p>export base. Post engaged major players in the garment </p><p>industry as requested in ref A and learned that two </p><p>important steps, a five-year strategy plan, and </p><p>establishment of a government/business working group have </p><p>been taken.  These actions prove that Sri Lanka is not ready </p><p>to give up on its apparel industry yet.  Creative thinking </p><p>on areas of engagement with the US, Sri Lanka\'s primary </p><p>market, has begun.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>TIFA NOW, FTA LATER </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sri Lanka is unique among garment producing countries in </p><p>that it imports almost all fabric inputs (from Asian </p><p>sources), with negligible domestic production.  Sri Lanka is </p><p>thus in a good position to argue for a bilateral FTA with </p><p>the U.S. based on a rule of origin on apparel, whereby </p><p>apparel exports to the U.S. would be duty free only if they </p><p>used U.S. fabric.  Such an agreement could provide major </p><p>benefits to the U.S. textile industry, creating as much as </p><p>$600 million in new exports a year (see ref B).  Sri Lanka </p><p>intends to use the recently signed Trade and Investment </p><p>Framework Agreement (TIFA) to make its case for an FTA.  In </p><p>the interim, private business and government representatives </p><p>have voiced a commitment to investigate the possibility of </p><p>sourcing fabric from the US, hoping to win Section 809-like </p><p>treatment that would exempt the fabric portion of any </p><p>apparel exports from U.S. duty.  Government sources, </p><p>including Secretary of Enterprise Development Ranjith </p><p>Fernando, said this consideration is now a priority since </p><p>the GSL realized a Free Trade Agreement with the US would </p><p>take several years. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The GSL is hopeful that it will get a sympathetic </p><p>hearing if it focuses on the benefits that would accrue to </p><p>the shrinking US fabric-producing industry.  The possible </p><p>reduction of the 10:1 trade imbalance with the US is </p><p>recognized as another selling point.  The government will </p><p>raise this issue with Deputy USTR Huntsman during his </p><p>planned visit later this year.  It may also ask for benefits </p><p>to be extended based on the industry\'s high labor standards. </p><p>(Note: Though building domestic fabric mills is in the </p><p>Strategic Plan, the broad manufacturing community has not </p><p>endorsed this measure. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. Garment manufacturers have also begun a discussion on the </p><p>competitiveness of US fabric, and suggested a catalog </p><p>show/trade fair and or visits of US fabric manufacturers be </p><p>organized to introduce American products to the Sri Lankan </p><p>market.  The government, buyers and manufacturers are </p><p>investigating the economics of using dedicated air shipments </p><p>to reduce turnaround times.  The Amcham is contemplating its </p><p>role in advocacy efforts. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>5-YEAR PLAN TO STRENGTHEN APPAREL INDUSTRY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. Stakeholders in the industry (producers, buyers, </p><p>government ministries and customs) met earlier this year to </p><p>design a survival strategy for 2005 and beyond.  The </p><p>resulting five-year strategic plan has five major </p><p>objectives: 1) increase apparel industry turnover from $2.3 </p><p>billion to $4.5 billion by 2007, 2) transform the industry </p><p>from manufacturing to fully integrated service, 3) increase </p><p>penetration of premium market segments, 4) excel </p><p>internationally in certain product categories, and 5) </p><p>consolidate and strengthen the industry.  It includes a </p><p>framework, initiatives and implementation scheme. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Steps identified in the plan are designated for </p><p>government, industry or firm level action. Government-level </p><p>actions would help across the entire spectrum of industries, </p><p>and are steps that should be taken in any case. These </p><p>include EDI facilities at the ports, lobbyists in key </p><p>markets, establishment of Chambers of Commerce, reform of </p><p>labor laws and development of infrastructure.  Industry is </p><p>tasked with improving marketing and competitive </p><p>intelligence, while individual firms are encouraged to form </p><p>strategic partnerships and invest in human resource </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>DIVERSIFICATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Sri Lanka\'s economy is heavily dependent on apparel </p><p>exports, which together represent 15% of GDP.  USAID\'s </p><p>Competitiveness Initiative (TCI) is working with eight </p><p>"clusters," identified as Sri Lanka\'s highest potential </p><p>export sectors, to diversify the country\'s export base.  The </p><p>GSL has praised TCI, and has created its own seven clusters, </p><p>modeled on USAID\'s.  These fifteen sectors (excluding </p><p>garments) are expected to provide much of the economic </p><p>growth in the future.  USAID is currently evaluating this </p><p>initiative and others related to competitiveness for future </p><p>funding.  Other efforts to diversify the country\'s economic </p><p>base include a major international campaign to attract </p><p>investment into a variety of fields.  Also, many company </p><p>representatives who remember International Executive Service </p><p>Corps\'s work here in the 1990s have welcomed the prospect of </p><p>USAID\'s revival of this program to provide firm-level </p><p>support.  Both government and business representatives </p><p>appreciated learning about TDA and OPIC and said they would </p><p>explore options for utilizing these programs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  GSL and industry welcomed Embassy efforts to focus </p><p>attention on MFA expiration.  Post sees merit in the Sri </p><p>Lankan proposal to use U.S. fabric inputs as the basis for a </p><p>bilateral free-trade agreement.  Such an approach - with the </p><p>prospect for significant new business for U.S. textile </p><p>manufacturers - would fulfill the Textile Working Group\'s </p><p>dual objectives of supporting the U.S. textile industry </p><p>while minimizing the impact of 2005 on Sri Lanka.  In the </p><p>meantime, Sri Lanka will welcome our continued assistance in </p><p>diversifying its export base. </p><p> </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
