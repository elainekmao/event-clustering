<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM A/DCM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-26-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV, LTTE - Peace Process, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 179 (12-26-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/DCM Long Lee.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:   DEMINING </p><p>-           SL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT </p><p> </p><p>DEMINING </p><p>-------- </p><p>1.  (C) We are really, really, really worried about your </p><p>e-mail re the apparent postponement in the DoD-sponsored </p><p>mil-to-mil demining program.  (Note:  We\'re not blaming </p><p>the messenger; we appreciate your successful effort to </p><p>quickly find out what\'s going on.)  We can appreciate </p><p>that important things are happening in the world that </p><p>demand resources.  That said, we think that a near-term </p><p>continuance in our demining programs here is crucial as </p><p>we try to underscore our strong support for the Sri </p><p>Lankan peace process via on-the-ground, "quick impact"- </p><p>type programs.  As you know, the QRDF was quite a hit, </p><p>but it wrapped up in late October.  We were counting on </p><p>the mil-to-mil program to continue the momentum very </p><p>early this year.  On the global stage, these programs do </p><p>not consume very much by way of resources in any case -- </p><p>but they go a long way here.  We would really appreciate </p><p>it if SA/INS would work closely with PM to ensure that we </p><p>have something up-and-running in Sri Lanka as soon as </p><p>feasible.  We do not want the months to drain away on </p><p>this.  Again, thanks for your help on this.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>SL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) Reviewing DRL\'s latest e-mail re "V-2" of the </p><p>Sri Lankan human rights report draft, we just noticed </p><p>that our key para re peace process events and their </p><p>impact on human rights has been axed from the </p><p>introduction.  (Note:  Thanks for passing "V-2" to us. </p><p>We would not have seen it without your help.)  Rebecca </p><p>Schwalbach of DRL goes on to note that she will talk to </p><p>her director about the para after Jan. 1.  We want to </p><p>make sure that DRL understands how important this para is </p><p>to the intro.  Can you speak to Schwalbach\'s boss on this </p><p>very early next week and get back to us if you think </p><p>there is a problem?  We are willing to take this issue </p><p>higher, if necessary.  We do not want to find out that </p><p>some deadline has passed and we have no time to reclama. </p><p>Thanks once again for all of your excellent work on this. </p><p>(POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
