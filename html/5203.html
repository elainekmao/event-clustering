<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000146 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: OMBUDSMAN CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE CLANDESTINE GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 2970 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 0127 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: On January 16, Human Rights Ombudsman Sergio </p><p>Morales unveiled a proposal for a UN-OAS led commission to </p><p>investigate clandestine groups (for details on the proposal, </p><p>see Ref A).  The proposal was enthusiastically received by </p><p>the press, human rights NGOs, and the international </p><p>community.  The Ambassador had previously contacted the </p><p>President, senior FRG members, the private sector, and the </p><p>press to urge a favorable response to the proposal.  After </p><p>the presentation, the Ambassador told the press that the USG </p><p>welcomes the initiative, that we hope the GOG will support </p><p>it, and that we\'ll be taking a look at how the USG can </p><p>support it.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Sergio Morales, along with his top assistants Maria </p><p>Eugenia Morales de Sierra and Dunia Illias, invited human </p><p>rights activists Helen Mack, Frank LaRue, and Orlando Blanco </p><p>to join him on January 16 to present the proposal for a </p><p>UN-OAS led commission to investigate clandestine groups.  The </p><p>Ambassador, with other members of the diplomatic and NGO </p><p>communities, and press, were in attendance and received the </p><p>announcement with enthusiasm and support. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Morales began the press conference by calling on the </p><p>Government of Guatemala to listen to the human rights groups </p><p>leading the call for this commission.  He said the "moment </p><p>has come" for the GOG to recognize that there will be no </p><p>peace in Guatemala until clandestine groups are removed from </p><p>their positions of power.  Morales requested that the </p><p>President and the Congress authorize a request to the UN </p><p>creating the commission. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Maria Eugenia Morales de Sierra then gave details from </p><p>the proposal, including a six-month period of investigation, </p><p>the composition of the investigative team (one UN member, one </p><p>OAS member, and one notable Guatemalan nominated by the </p><p>President), and the scope (from January 1996 to the present). </p><p> Morales de Sierra also mentioned that the findings of the </p><p>commission could possibly be used to remove the influence of </p><p>these groups from the government as well as in prosecutions </p><p>by the Public Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The press appeared initially stunned by the weight of </p><p>this announcement, and had many questions for the Ombudsman. </p><p>Members of the press asked what the GOG\'s, UN\'s, and OAS\'s </p><p>responses were, to which Morales replied that he had not yet </p><p>received any official responses.  The press also asked why </p><p>they had not heard anything about this proposal before, and </p><p>Morales said that they were being careful because the </p><p>existence of clandestine groups is such a grave, but </p><p>sensitive, issue. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) LaRue chimed in with thanks for the Ombudsman and a </p><p>brief explanation that this commission would be carrying on </p><p>the work of previous investigative commissions, but also </p><p>would work to end the current cycle of impunity that </p><p>endangers human rights and justice advocates in Guatemala </p><p>today.  Contradicting Morales, LaRue (and later Mack) also </p><p>said that while the human rights movement would welcome the </p><p>congress\'s ratification of the proposal, only the President\'s </p><p>request is necessary for the international community\'s </p><p>acceptance and formation of the commission. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Mack said UN and OAS involvement would protect the </p><p>work of the commission. Mack maintained that clandestine </p><p>groups are powerful mutations of war era power structures and </p><p>must be removed if Guatemala is ever going to progress. </p><p>Blanco said that he is worried about the way in which </p><p>clandestine groups influence weak democratic institutions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The Ambassador informed Mario Polanco, Helen Mack and </p><p>Frank LaRue of his lobbying efforts in support of the </p><p>proposal with the government and private sector (Ref B), for </p><p>which they expressed appreciation.  Polanco told HROff that </p><p>the human rights community was pleased by how strong a </p><p>backing the Ambassador was giving this initiative.  Polanco </p><p>and Blanco both told HROff that they see the USG as their </p><p>primary ally in the fight against clandestine groups. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Reaction </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Leading dailies gave prominent coverage to the press </p><p>conference in their January 17 editions.  El Periodico and </p><p>Prensa Libre carried the Ambassador\'s statements and Prensa </p><p>Libre featured front-page pictures of the Ambassador shaking </p><p>Morales\' hand.  Siglo Veintiuno showed the Ambassador shaking </p><p>Mack and LaRue\'s hands in a front-page photo. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The Ambassador was quoted by El Periodico supporting </p><p>the proposal: </p><p> </p><p>"I hope that the government gives its firm backing to this </p><p>proposal for a commission to investigate clandestine groups. </p><p>I think it is a terrific initiative that can make a </p><p>tremendous contribution." </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Comment: The press conference was a great success, </p><p>generating attention and public support for the proposal. </p><p>Although the USG is not providing financial support at this </p><p>time, our moral support is clearly most welcome.  However, </p><p>some fundamental details, such as the GOG response and role </p><p>remain unclear.  While the proposal came from civil society, </p><p>the Ombudsman showed leadership by adding his public support </p><p>and imprimatur.  We will continue to look for ways to support </p><p>the proposal through our public and private diplomacy.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
