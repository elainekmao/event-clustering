<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE, EUR/NCE AND PM/HDP </p><p>BELGRADE PLEASE SHARE WITH PODGORICA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, KHDP, SI, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN GOVERNMENT: ITF DIRECTOR CIMPERSEK MUST GO </p><p> </p><p>REF: LJUBLJANA 0749 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolOff Darren Taylor for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Government of Croatia is frustrated with the </p><p>leadership of the International Trust Fund and will block </p><p>extension ITF director Jernej Cimpersek\'s mandate.  GoC </p><p>officials expressed their frustration with Cimpersek\'s lack </p><p>of professionalism and his unwillingness to focus on all </p><p>donor priorities which, they claim, has led to a </p><p>"polarization" of the demining community in the Balkans. </p><p>They acknowledged that Cimpersek has been difficult to work </p><p>with, but rejected the allegation that their decision was </p><p>based on personality conflict.  The GoC asserted that their </p><p>decision is firm; as an extension can be passed only by </p><p>consensus of the managing board, it appears Cimpersek\'s days </p><p>as Director are numbered.  GoC officials said they would </p><p>prepare a position paper for the ITF managing board and key </p><p>donors outlining reasons for their position.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOC:  "It\'s Time For A Change at the ITF" </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 28, we met with senior GOC officials involved </p><p>in the work of the International Trust Fund (ITF).  Present </p><p>were Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Davorko Vidovic, </p><p>MFA Advisor for Demining Dijana Plestina, and Croatian Mine </p><p>Action Center (CROMAC) Director Oto Jungwirth.  Plestina -- </p><p>who is PM Racan\'s wife -- described Croatia\'s building </p><p>frustration with ITF Director Cimpersek.  She said the ITF </p><p>managing board reacted strongly to Croatia\'s announcement at </p><p>the July 22 board meeting at which it blocked extension of </p><p>Cimpersek\'s mandate, but insisted that Croatia\'s decision is </p><p>firm.  Labor Minister Vidovic said that the position Plestina </p><p>presented was the view of the GoC, and that the decision to </p><p>block Cimpersek\'s extension had been taken in advance of the </p><p>July 22 meeting.  The decision was final and would not be </p><p>reversed under any circumstances, asserted Minister Vidovic. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Vidovic said that there have been a series of </p><p>incidents over the past year in which Cimpersek and his </p><p>deputy Goran Gacnik had acted inappropriately, both in public </p><p>and at regional fora on humanitarian demining.  It seemed at </p><p>times that their goal was to embarrass GOC officials present </p><p>at the meetings or Croatia in general.  He stated that while </p><p>the GOC was not completely innocent of responsibility for the </p><p>strained relationship, GOC officials were always willing to </p><p>sit at the table to discuss ways to find solutions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Vidovic explained that as the third largest donor to </p><p>the ITF behind the US and EU, the GoC recognizes its </p><p>responsibility to support the ITF\'s role in the region.  The </p><p>ITF has contributed to important positive developments in </p><p>demining in the region, but the current leadership of the ITF </p><p>seems to have lost sight of the fact that it is the donors, </p><p>not the ITF staff, which are most responsible for these </p><p>successes.  Vidovic said he had instructed key personnel to </p><p>draft a position paper outlining the GOC\'s position </p><p>concerning the ITF leadership, a copy of which will be </p><p>provided to ITF managing board members and key donors.  He </p><p>had also alerted FM Picula about this issue to prepare him </p><p>for possible engagement. </p><p>5. (C) Plestina and Jungwirth stated that most of their </p><p>concerns centered on issues of professionalism, regional </p><p>ethnic biases, and the polarization of the demining community </p><p>in the region.  They claimed they made repeated efforts to </p><p>improve their working relationship with the ITF, but </p><p>Cimpersek seemed to prefer to distance himself from Croatia </p><p>and engage as little as possible on Croatian matters.  When </p><p>he did engage, it was often in a rude, uncooperative, or </p><p>unprofessional manner.  During bilateral meetings, the ITF </p><p>director would launch into tirades about what the ITF was or </p><p>was not willing do in Croatia, and how Croats are his biggest </p><p>problem in the region.  Plestina claimed other </p><p>representatives from regional mine action centers had lodged </p><p>similar complaints. </p><p> </p><p>USG Intervention Appreciated, But Unsuccessful </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Vidovic and Plestina expressed appreciation for USG </p><p>efforts to improve the relationship with Cimpersek, </p><p>especially PM Assistant Secretary Bloomfield\'s personal </p><p>involvement during a GOC-sponsored conference on demining in </p><p>Dubrovnik in October 2002.  They noted that even in the </p><p>presence of senior USG officials, the ITF director displayed </p><p>unprofessional behavior and used unacceptable language at </p><p> </p><p>times when contentious issues were discussed. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Plestina claimed that although they had low </p><p>expectations, the GoC had made efforts to improve the working </p><p>relationship after the meeting in Dubrovnik, if for no other </p><p>reason than they had been asked to do so by the USG.  But </p><p>Cimpersek showed signs that he was unwilling to take steps to </p><p>improve the relationship.  He did not attend meetings that </p><p>were held in Croatia and refused to travel to Croatia for </p><p>some time.  He has been unwilling to meet with GOC leaders to </p><p>discuss ways of improving cooperation or to solicit GOC views </p><p>about developments at the ITF. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The GoC decision to block Cimpersek\'s extension does </p><p>not come as a surprise; Plestina and CROMAC have complained </p><p>to us many times in the past, and we have been present at </p><p>meetings when Cimpersek has acted inappropriately.  The </p><p>presence of Labor Minister Vidovic at the July 28 meeting was </p><p>clearly intended to ensure that we understood that the GoC </p><p>decision is a formal cabinet position and not just a </p><p>reflection of a personality conflict between the ITF director </p><p>and the PM\'s wife.  Vidovic has in the past told us that he </p><p>does not want the disagreement over the leadership of the ITF </p><p>to become an irritant, but wants to make sure we understand </p><p>that the GoC position is final. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We concur with the GoC that it is time for Cimpersek </p><p>to go and suggest that the managing board should seek a new, </p><p>more professional director who is committed to working </p><p>closely with governments in the region and with the main </p><p>donors, both in the field and in donor capitals. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
