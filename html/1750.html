<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001350 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/DSS, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/OP/AF, DS/PSP/FPD, </p><p>AF/EX, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KCRM, AMGT, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: RISING CRIME IN LAGOS: AMBASSADOR  MEETINGS </p><p>WITH THE ACTING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND THE </p><p>INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: On Friday, June 8, Ambassador Jeter, RSO </p><p>Gibson and RSO Bishop met with the Inspector General of </p><p>the Nigeria Police Force (IGP) and the Acting National </p><p>Security Advisor who is also the Director General of the </p><p>Nigeria State Security Service to discuss the increase </p><p>in violent crime in Lagos.  The meetings were a frank </p><p>exchange of views on the current crime situation and </p><p>resulted in promises from the Police IG for increased </p><p>Mobile Police Officers to be directly assigned to the </p><p>Consulate and for a more proactive approach to command </p><p>and control problems of security forces by the A/NSA. </p><p>The MOA establishing a formal relationship between the </p><p>U.S. Mission and the NPF was also discussed.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. On Friday, June 8, Ambassador Jeter, RSO Gibson, </p><p>Lagos and RSO Bishop, Abuja met with Musiliu Smith, </p><p>Inspector General of the Nigeria Police Force (IGP) at </p><p>the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) Headquarters in Abuja. </p><p>In addition to the IGP, eight Deputy Inspectors General </p><p>were present at this meeting.  The Ambassador expressed </p><p>his gratitude for the NPF  continuous support of the </p><p>U.S. Diplomatic Missions in Nigeria.  He then expressed </p><p>his concern to the IGP regarding the recent increase in </p><p>criminal violence in Lagos.  Ambassador Jeter advised </p><p>the IGP that most of the diplomatic, expatriate and </p><p>business community in the affluent Victoria and Ikoyi </p><p>Island neighborhoods of Lagos share our concerns </p><p>regarding the dramatic increase in criminal activity. </p><p>The Ambassador added that such events are extremely </p><p>costly to the GON in terms of potential loss of foreign </p><p>investment and steady erosion of a solid economic base. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter also informed the IGP that he had </p><p>previously met with the Lagos State Governor regarding </p><p>this issue and expressed the same concerns for the </p><p>overall cost to the economy of Lagos if this wave of </p><p>crime were not stopped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. RSO Gibson briefed the Inspectors regarding specifics </p><p>of the increase in criminal activity in Lagos. RSO </p><p>advised IGP Smith that he has noted a significant </p><p>increase in crime during the past eight months in Lagos. </p><p>While there has always been a criminal threat, recent </p><p>events indicate that this threat had escalated beyond </p><p>control.  RSO described how gangs of violent criminals </p><p>have begun to concentrate their efforts in the </p><p>previously considered safe areas of Victoria Island (VI) </p><p>and Ikoyi. He also noted that these criminals appear to </p><p>be well organized, well trained and increasingly brazen </p><p>in the commission of criminal offenses. These gangs work </p><p>in groups numbering up to eight persons, armed with </p><p>military-style automatic rifles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. RSO Gibson further described how the criminals had </p><p>apparently crossed several previously sacrosanct lines </p><p>by increasingly targeting diplomatic vehicles (to </p><p>include U.S.) in armed car-jacking attempts. Previously, </p><p>members of the diplomatic community residing in VI and </p><p>Ikoyi had been relatively immune to being targeted by </p><p>criminals. The IGP was informed that most diplomatic, </p><p>expatriate and business community residents in Lagos </p><p>are, for the first time, expressing a real fear of </p><p>travel during the peak periods of criminal activity from </p><p>2000 to 2300 hours.  The IGP was also told that this </p><p>increase in criminal activity is already having a </p><p>negative impact on local businesses, as most people are </p><p>too afraid to venture out of their homes during the </p><p>evening hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. To further illustrate the severity of the situation, </p><p>RSO Gibson described two recent incidents affecting U.S. </p><p>Consulate Lagos.  First, the RSO said that the Consulate </p><p>Local Guard Force mobile patrol vehicle was the victim </p><p>of an armed carjacking in which a NPF officer assigned </p><p>to the Consulate was shot and killed by the criminals </p><p>(Lagos 01432).  RSO also described another incident in </p><p>which the Assistant Regional Security Officer was the </p><p>victim of an attempted car-jacking incident (Lagos </p><p>01475).  RSO continued that late-model European and </p><p>Japanese sport utility vehicles have always been at </p><p>increased risk of being targeted by carjackers. Now, </p><p>however, criminals have begun targeting all makes and </p><p>models of vehicles and using stolen vehicles to commit </p><p>other crimes before fleeing the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. RSO advised that, in his opinion, one of the main </p><p>obstacles to successfully countering this criminal </p><p>threat was a decided lack of command and control of all </p><p>available security forces deployed.  RSO added that he </p><p>has personally seen how representatives of the Mobile </p><p>Police Force directly responsible for protecting </p><p>diplomatic properties and personnel are incapable of </p><p>receiving or transmitting pertinent security information </p><p>to other offices of the NPF to include the Rapid </p><p>Response Squad (RRS), the Special Anti-Robbery Squad </p><p>(SARS), the Joint Military/Police patrols, and the </p><p>regular NNP.  RSO offered that a central point of </p><p>command and control, if established, would coordinate </p><p>all forces to counteract any threat.  IGP Smith </p><p>countered that all of these forces were under his </p><p>control and that he was looking at ways of better </p><p>coordinating their efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Ambassador Jeter queried IGP Smith on the status of </p><p>the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) submitted to the NPF </p><p>by both AmEmbassy Abuja and CONGEN Lagos.  The MOA was </p><p>requested in response to a Department (DS) directive to </p><p>formalize the existing relationship between the Mission </p><p>in Nigeria and the NPF officers assigned to protect U.S. </p><p>Diplomatic interests.  The IGP responded that he was </p><p>aware of the MOA and that his office was required to </p><p>consult with other agencies and gain their approval. </p><p>The IGP was also queried regarding the status of </p><p>information requested by RSO Abuja to initiate Anti- </p><p>Terrorism-Assistance (ATA) training offered to the NPF </p><p>by the Department.  The IGP responded by directing the </p><p>appropriate Assistant Inspector General of Police for </p><p>training (also present at this meeting) to take the </p><p>necessary action to promptly provide this information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The IGP responded that the NPF was well aware of </p><p>the recent increase in crime in Lagos, and attributed it </p><p>to mass unemployment.  He gave assurances that he would </p><p>deploy more police officer to the area in an effort to </p><p>stem the rising criminal tide.  The IGP also attributed </p><p>the increase in crime to the presence of the numerous </p><p>small vendors and kiosks that are located on almost </p><p>every street in Victoria and Ikoyi Island.  The IGP said </p><p>that the presence of these vendors and kiosks afford </p><p>criminals a means to easily conceal their criminal </p><p>intent in residential areas where they operate and also </p><p>serves as a platform for surveillance before conducting </p><p>criminal acts.  IGP Smith further noted that the Lagos </p><p>State Government and not the NPF had the responsibility </p><p>to eliminate these unauthorized vendors and kiosks.  In </p><p>terms of the diplomatic community in Lagos, The IGP </p><p>promised to send a representative to the next meeting </p><p>tentatively scheduled for June 14th to officially discuss </p><p>the security situation and what the NPF proposes to do </p><p>to control the violent crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Ambassador Jeter, RSO Gibson and RSO Bishop also met </p><p>with the Acting National Security Advisor who is also </p><p>the Director General of the Nigerian State Security </p><p>Service (SSS) at the SSS headquarters in Abuja regarding </p><p>the same issue.  Both the Ambassador and RSO Gibson </p><p>briefed the Acting NSA regarding the increase in crime </p><p>in Ikoyi and Victoria Island, Lagos, and expressed their </p><p>concerns that local criminals were becoming more </p><p>organized, violent and brazen in the commission of their </p><p>offenses.  The Acting NSA was attentive and clearly </p><p>impressed with the Mission  extensive information on </p><p>the criminal threat that in Lagos.  The Acting NSA </p><p>admitted that there was a well-organized gang working in </p><p>the area of Ikoyi that apparently had received some </p><p>military and/or police training.  He revealed that the </p><p>SSS and its counterpart in the Republic of Benin were </p><p>working closely to eradicate the criminal presence along </p><p>the porous Nigerian/Benin border and would use all </p><p>available means to counteract this new carjacking </p><p>threat.  As the meeting drew to a close, the Acting NSA </p><p>queried the Ambassador on what can be done to restore </p><p>the confidence of the people in the police  ability to </p><p>control crime.  The Ambassador responded that a central </p><p>authority in control of Nigeria  security agencies and </p><p>assets in Lagos would be a positive step to restoring </p><p>the people  confidence; moreover, the GON needed to </p><p>send a senior security official to brief the diplomatic </p><p>community in Lagos to convince them that the security </p><p>situation would be brought under control.  The Acting </p><p>NSA promised to take these items under advisement for </p><p>the next security meeting scheduled this week and also </p><p>offered to send a representative to the next scheduled </p><p>Diplomatic Corps meeting on security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The Consul General and RSO will schedule a meeting </p><p>with the Lagos-based Diplomatic Corps for June 14th, to </p><p>brief them on the results of these meetings.  It is </p><p>hoped that promised representatives from the NPF and the </p><p>SSS do indeed attend to foster a frank exchange of views </p><p>on the current crime situation.  Results of this meeting </p><p>will be reported as appropriate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
