<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 00028 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHRISTIANS IN MOSUL </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON DECEMBER 29 AMBASSADOR CALLED ON SENIOR </p><p>CHRISTIAN CLERIC RESIDENT IN MOSUL, CHALDEAN </p><p>ARCHBISHOP GARMO (STRICTLY PROTECT), </p><p>FOR DISCUSSION OF CHRISTIAN CONDITIONS IN </p><p>MOSUL AREA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  GARMO TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>FURTHER DISTURBING OF CHRISTIAN VILLAGES.  AS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, WHAT RELOCATION THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>HAS BEEN OVER FOR WEEKS.  THE CHRISTIAN (NOT JUST </p><p>CHALDEAN) VILLAGES TO THE NORTH OF MOSUL IN THE </p><p>AREA AROUND TELL KAYF ARE EXISTING NORMALLY. </p><p>(A SUBSEQUENT VISIT TO SEVERAL OF THOSE VILLAGES </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE CASE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE TWO CHIEF ISSUES ON THE PATRIARCH\'S </p><p>MIND, GARMO SAID, ARE THE CHRISTIAN DESIRE TO </p><p>OBTAIN PERMISSION FOR CHRISTIAN TEACHING IN THE </p><p>SCHOOLS, (THIS IS ALLOWED ONLY IF THE STUDENT </p><p>BODY LS 51& CHRISTIAN), AND THE WISH FOR SOME </p><p>KIND OF NEWSLETTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE PATRIARCH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT WITH SADDAM FOR SOME </p><p>TIME.  WHILE THE "UNPRECEDENTED" CHRISTMAS </p><p>GREETINGS FROM SADDAM TO THE PATRIARCH ON </p><p>CHRISTMAS EVE HAD RAISED HOPES, THEY WERE DASHED </p><p>WHEN SADDAM CONTINUED TO PUT OFF THE PATRIARCH, </p><p>BUT DID RECEIVE THE CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TINY CHALDEAN LEBANESE </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  LOCALLY, THE GOVERNOR IS UNFAILINGLY </p><p>PLEASANT, BUT WILL TAKE NO INITIATIVE.  THE </p><p>ARCHBISHOP, THEREFORE, RELIES ON THE HEAD OF </p><p>SECURITY FOR  MOSUL, A NEW APPOINTEE </p><p>WHO HAS SO FAR PROVED HELPFUL AND COMPASSIONATE. </p><p>BUT THIS IS A WEAK REED, AND THE CHURCH WOULD </p><p>NATURALLY PREFER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOP.  IN </p><p>THE CASE OF SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS STILL REGARD THEIR ACE IN THE </p><p>HOLE TO BE ADNAN KHAIRALLAH\'S FATHER, </p><p>WHO IS ACCESSIBLE AND HAS BEEN HELPFUL DURING </p><p>DIFFICULT TIMES IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN VISITING MONASTERIES AND VILLAGES NORTHEAST </p><p>AND SOUTHEAST OF MOSUL,     EMBASSY OFFICIALS </p><p>DID SEE MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPANKING </p><p>NEW VILLAGES, MARKED "SADDAM MODEL VILLAGE," </p><p>AND THE 4TH CENTURY MONASTERY AT MAR BAHNAM </p><p>HAS RECEIVED AN EXPENSIVE FACELIFTING INSIDE </p><p>AND OUTSIDE, INCLUDING EXPENSIVE NEW MARBLE FACING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
