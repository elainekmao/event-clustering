(SBU) Summary: Rice merchants are nervously anticipating </p><p>the impending privatization of Burma\'s rice markets.  Though </p><p>the long-term benefits of this step are manifold, a hurried </p><p>implementation of this drastic policy could have some </p><p>unwelcome side effects in the short haul.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOB Washes it\'s Hands of Sticky Rice Trade </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The GOB is preparing to turn over to the private </p><p>sector all aspects of the rice trade, according to the Union </p><p>of Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UMCCI), and the </p><p>Rice Millers\' and Merchants\' Associations.  According to the </p><p>businessmen, beginning with the next monsoon crop (sowed in </p><p>June, harvested in October/November), farmers will be exempt </p><p>from their usual mandatory advance sales to the government, </p><p>and merchants will be allowed (with a few significant </p><p>restrictions) to freely sell and export rice. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) This sudden change of policy came as a bolt from the </p><p>blue on March 31, when Secretary Two (Lt. Gen. Soe Win) </p><p>called a snap meeting of the UMCCI and top rice merchants. </p><p>According to a UMCCI official, as far as he knew, there had </p><p>been no prior deliberations on changing rice policy, although </p><p>the UMCCI and others had been lobbying for some time for the </p><p>move.  There\'s also little evidence that the GOB had been </p><p>consulting with international agriculture or privatization </p><p>experts to draw up an effective strategy.  The official </p><p>speculated that the government has grown increasingly </p><p>concerned with the rising price of rice on the domestic </p><p>market, and wanted to pass on to the private sector the </p><p>responsibility for this sensitive issue. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The broad outlines of the GOB\'s privatization </p><p>strategy trickled out in the March 31 meeting and a follow-up </p><p>session on April 5.  Another confab is likely sometime after </p><p>April 20.  Rice merchants say they think an official </p><p>announcement of the policy change should come within the </p><p>month, alongside the formation of a Rice and Paddy Trade </p><p>Steering Committee that will direct and control all aspects </p><p>of the privatization.  As envisioned, the Committee will be </p><p>chaired by Lt. Gen. Soe Win.  Its membership will include the </p><p>Ministers of Commerce, Agriculture, Industry (1), and Energy, </p><p>and six private sector representatives. </p><p> </p><p>Freedom to Buy and Sell...Sort Of </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Though the policy is not yet official, according to </p><p>the UMCCI and rice merchants the regime will no longer </p><p>purchase rice or paddy from farmers, leaving buying and </p><p>milling to the private sector to arrange.  The GOB, through </p><p>the Steering Committee, will determine the domestic demand </p><p>for rice as well as the amount needed to continue </p><p>compensating civil servants and the military.  There will </p><p>also be a undetermined buffer built in for emergency and </p><p>required ASEAN stockpiles.  The rice merchants will be </p><p>required to sell this total amount to the Ministry of </p><p>Commerce\'s Myanmar Agriculture Produce Trading (MAPT) company </p><p>either at cost or at the prevailing market price. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Existing agricultural traders, as well as a number </p><p>of new private export firms the UMCCI hopes to establish, </p><p>will be free to export any surplus above this calculated </p><p>amount.  The government will take its usual 10 percent export </p><p>tax, and will require the exporter to exchange an additional </p><p>50 percent of its export earnings with the GOB at a </p><p>yet-undetermined rate.  The regime will also earn income from </p><p>renting out MAPT warehouses to private exporters. </p><p> </p><p>Private Sector Sweats Lack of Technology, Education </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Though the private sector representatives with whom </p><p>we spoke were quite enthused about their new opportunity, </p><p>they were also quite anxious.  They complained they\'d been </p><p>given no time to prepare for this change, and were now </p><p>rushing around trying to organize Rice Merchants\' Association </p><p>branches across the country.  Additionally, they admitted </p><p>that the private sector had no infrastructure to provide </p><p>education and technology to farmers and merchants, keys to </p><p>the success of this experiment.  Right now, a UMCCI official </p><p>said, they were banking on promises of continued government </p><p>support and a new program of loans or grants to help upgrade </p><p>badly outdated milling equipment.  Without the education and </p><p>new technology, one rice merchant warned, there\'s no way </p><p>Burmese rice will compete in the long term. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Financing will also be a problem.  With only a </p><p>couple of month\'s warning, rice growers will be stuck this </p><p>season without the traditional government advance purchase </p><p>payments that, while unfairly low, were still the farmers\' </p><p>main source of cash to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuel, and </p><p>other inputs.  It is unclear whether the GOB\'s Myanmar </p><p>Agricultural Development Bank will expand its currently </p><p>paltry agricultural loan program to make up for this </p><p>shortfall.  With the demise of the private banking sector, </p><p>rice merchants and farmers may have to turn to the existing </p><p>informal lending networks, with their exorbitant interest </p><p>rates, in order to take full advantage of their new </p><p>opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>Will Prices Fall? </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) With no preparation for change and a steep curve for </p><p>improvement of technology and education, the hoped-for supply </p><p>boom could be at least a season or two off.  However, newly </p><p>liberated merchants are licking their lips over the potential </p><p>demand for exports of Burmese paddy and milled rice, despite </p><p>lackluster quality.  Bangladeshi traders clamor for as much </p><p>paddy as they can grab, sparking robust border trade (legal </p><p>and illegal) along the Rakhine State-Bangladesh frontier. </p><p>Likewise, large global rice traders (such as Malaysia\'s </p><p>Petronas) regularly come up short when the GOB suddenly </p><p>re-allocates export rice for domestic consumption. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) For rice traders, however, the devil of the new </p><p>policy will lie in its details.  Rice has always been a </p><p>politically sensitive product in Burma, and the government </p><p>has in its hands more than enough power to ensure that the </p><p>new market freedoms do not disrupt domestic supplies.  MAPT </p><p>may exert effectively a right of first refusal on all major </p><p>rice contracts; the government can cancel the export permits </p><p>of companies whose actions threaten to be disruptive to </p><p>markets; and, if all else fails, can simply ban rice exports. </p><p> Though they claim to have full faith in the GOB\'s </p><p>intentions, traders are, of course, aware of this.  They have </p><p>seen the business of foreign traders in beans and pulses </p><p>handicapped by the decision last year to cease issuing </p><p>permits to trade for foreign firms.  As a result, whatever </p><p>the opportunities companies may see emerging from the new </p><p>government rice policy, entrepreneurs almost certainly will </p><p>move cautiously in risking their capital in these untested </p><p>waters. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) That said, government action in this area is </p><p>welcome.  This may be a one-off move by the GOB, but it also </p><p>could be the first step toward broader agricultural reforms </p><p>that the Japanese, in particular, have been pushing as part </p><p>of their economic adjustment programs.  If these first steps </p><p>go well, others could follow. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
