<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 000043 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/BSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, EAID, BR, Domestic Politics </p><p>SUBJECT: LULA GETS STARTED - FIGHTING HUNGER ON A TIGHT </p><p>BUDGET </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 BRASILIA 4561 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER FOR REASONS 1.5(b) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.(C) SUMMARY.  President Lula,s administration is </p><p>underway.  At his first cabinet meeting on January 3, Lula </p><p>emphatically focused his ministers both on combating hunger </p><p>and on fiscal austerity.  While the government\'s maneuvering </p><p>room is circumscribed by the lack of a congressional majority </p><p>and its financial limitations, Lula seems determined to chart </p><p>a course that will address hunger, maintain fiscal </p><p>discipline, and either build a stronger congressional </p><p>coalition or find ways to do without it.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER IS JOB NUMBER ONE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) President Lula da Silva has never made a secret of his </p><p>desire to attack hunger.  He promised it during the campaign </p><p>and in his election-night speech.  His first post-electoral </p><p>act in November was to set up the &Zero Fome8 (Zero Hunger) </p><p>program headed by Jose Graziano, who now holds the title </p><p>&Extraordinary (Ad hoc) Minister for Food Security and </p><p>Combating Hunger.8  Graziano told us he intends to implement </p><p>his nascent program in phases, beginning in the poorest areas </p><p>of the northeast.  He will not work alone.  At the January 3 </p><p>cabinet meeting, Lula directed each of his thirty-four </p><p>cabinet-level officials to draft an anti-hunger strategy </p><p>within thirty days. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Even those ministries not normally associated with a </p><p>social agenda are jumping aboard:  Defense Minister Viega has </p><p>pledged an anti-illiteracy program, Justice Minister Bastos </p><p>will combat child prostitution, and Finance Minister Palocci </p><p>will look to expand credit cooperatives.  In fact, Lula </p><p>announced that on January 10-11, he will take the entire </p><p>cabinet to the poor backlands of the northeast to launch the </p><p>Zero Fome program.  With Congress out of session until </p><p>mid-February, Lula carried out his first act by Presidential </p><p>Decree (MP).  MP 103, the first of this administration, </p><p>formalizes a number of bodies in the President\'s Office, </p><p>including a Food Security Council (CONSEA) to develop </p><p>anti-hunger policies. </p><p> </p><p>A CAP ON SPENDING - DESPITE PLEAS FROM THE STATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>4. (SBU) Combating hunger takes money, but the GoB does not </p><p>appear inclined to deviate from its austerity program.  The </p><p>Ministries, anti-hunger projects will have to come from </p><p>reprogramming existing funds, not new resources.  Since </p><p>November, Lula has been inundated by pleas for financial help </p><p>from cash-strapped states, many of them politically-critical </p><p>to his coalition, yet he has stayed the course.  The richest </p><p>states tend to be the squeakiest wheels: Rio Grande do Sul </p><p>will be forced to slash its budget by 18%, while Minas Gerais </p><p>faces a deficit of R$700 million. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  But the biggest headache may be the state of Rio de </p><p>Janeiro (septel), which is now behind both on its debts to </p><p>the federal government and the salaries of its state </p><p>employees.  After Rio missed several scheduled debt payments </p><p>to the federal treasury in recent weeks, the GoB first froze </p><p>financial transfers from Brasilia to the state and then </p><p>withdrew R$ 86 million from the state\'s bank accounts (per a </p><p>clause in the loan contract).  This prompted </p><p>newly-inaugurated Rio Governor Rosinha Garotinho to go to the </p><p>Supreme Court to try to unblock the financial transfers while </p><p>calling the GoB,s actions &a declaration of war on Rio8. </p><p>The episode is significant because Garotinho,s Brazilian </p><p>Socialist Party (PSB) is a member of the PT\'s congressional </p><p>coalition.  Rio gave Lula 79% of votes in October\'s </p><p>presidential runoff, his greatest support from any state --in </p><p>part due to Garotinho\'s support.  Rosinha has attributed this </p><p>episode to a long-running PSB/PT feud in the state, as </p><p>Rosinha,s husband, Anthony Garotinho, ran against Lula for </p><p>the presidency at the same time as Rosinha defeated the PT,s </p><p>Benedita da Silva for the Rio statehouse.  The PSB/PT dispute </p><p>will likely be patched up, but it provides a telling example </p><p>of how financial scarcity and local political antagonisms can </p><p>weaken the PT,s coalition.  It is also a measure of Lula,s </p><p>resolve to limit spending, even to key allies. </p><p> </p><p>FIGHTER PLANES IN A HOLDING PATTERN </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) Another example of the GoB,s early commitment to </p><p>austerity is the decision to delay purchase of twelve fighter </p><p>planes for the Brazilian Air Force to replace its aging </p><p>Mirage jets.  Instead of choosing a vendor for the roughly </p><p>$800 million contract, new Defense Minister Viegas has </p><p>announced that the purchase will be postponed for a year, </p><p>cutting it close for the Mirages, scheduled to go out of </p><p>service in 2005.  As the planes were to be purchased through </p><p>financing, the postponement will not free up funds, but it </p><p>will avoid locking the administration into a huge commitment </p><p>in its first weeks in office.  Viegas may now consider </p><p>purchasing used aircraft, which could improve the chances for </p><p>the package of used F-16s that is among the bidders. </p><p> </p><p>IN CONGRESS, &THE CLASSES COME LATER8 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The new Congress will not get down to work until </p><p>February 17, giving the administration six weeks to try to </p><p>secure a majority in both houses by bringing the PMDB party </p><p>into the coalition.  While talks with the PMDB fell apart </p><p>before Christmas (reftel), both sides seem willing to keep </p><p>trying and say they are committed to abiding by a side deal </p><p>by which the PT will support the candidacy of a PMDB member </p><p>for Senate President if the PMDB supports the PT candidate </p><p>for Chamber President.  The PMDB is a difficult party to </p><p>negotiate with because of its internal rifts, so any deal </p><p>will likely have to wait until its leadership elections on </p><p>January 30. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Lula is working on a &Plan B8 if the PMDB talks </p><p>fall through.  Like Presidents Sarney and Collor before him, </p><p>Lula may try to mitigate his lack of a congressional majority </p><p>by relying on public pressure and his own popularity to </p><p>short-circuit congressional opposition.  The PT has always </p><p>used &assemblyist8 fora to bring different sectors and </p><p>players to a common table.  From this impulse sprang the </p><p>Economic and Social Development Council (CDES) --also </p><p>legalized by MP 103 (above).  CDES brings together 82 </p><p>business, labor, and civic leaders in a sort of Brazilian </p><p>&social pact8.  The GoB hopes to use it as a mechanism for </p><p>the public to ratify its policies and thus force Congress to </p><p>support its agenda.  Tarso Genro, former PT Mayor of Porto </p><p>Alegre, will be Lula,s Special Secretary for CDES; and Luiz </p><p>Dulci, the Secretary-General of the President\'s Office, will </p><p>work closely with him and with civil society.  CDES will </p><p>reportedly focus first on pension reform. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) But mindful that neither President Sarney nor Collor </p><p>maintained his congressional support after the flush of </p><p>electoral victory dissipated, Lula surely would prefer a real </p><p>congressional majority to an evanescent social pact. </p><p>Congress can be a tough place for a president without a </p><p>majority.  Or, as one wit noted while Lula received his </p><p>Presidential certificate at the Congressional inauguration </p><p>ceremony, &Lula needs to remember that the presidential </p><p>diploma comes first, but the classes come later.8 </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (C) Lula must be doing something right.  This week the </p><p>Brazilian real strengthened to below R$3.40 to the dollar for </p><p>the first time since mid-September --before the first round </p><p>of elections.  The GoB,s reassuring economic team and steady </p><p>drumbeat of austerity rhetoric appear to have calmed the </p><p>markets.  While the political and financial dragons still lie </p><p>before him, Lula appears to have the sound instinct and </p><p>steady nerves it will take to tame them. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
