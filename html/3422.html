<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003796 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>MOSCOW FOR U/S BOLTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: ITALY\'S ENCOURAGING POSITION ON ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 3580 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03796  011602Z </p><p>     B. ROME 3703 </p><p>     C. ROME 3760 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON AUG 1, THE AMBASSADOR AND ADCM MET WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p>GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, THE DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO PM AND </p><p>ACTING FM BERLUSCONI, TO DISCUSS THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL </p><p>COURT (ICC).  (OTHER ISSUES REPORTED SEPTEL.)  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DEPLOYED THE "SUPER-TALKER" POINTS ON THE ICC AND ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH CASTELLANETA AND STRESSED, AS HE HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, THAT SIGNING AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH THE GOI </p><p>IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT THE U.S. IS NOT TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE COURT </p><p>BUT IS RATHER TRYING TO PROTECT ITS PERSONNEL WITH AN ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT.  FURTHERMORE, SUCH AGREEMENTS FALL WITHIN THE </p><p>ROME STATUTE PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CASTELLANETA REPLIED THAT THE GOI PREFERS TO WAIT </p><p>UNTIL THE EU REACHES A CONSENSUS ON ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS. </p><p>IN ANY CASE, THE GOI WOULD BE WILLING TO SIGN ONE WITH THE </p><p>U.S., SAID CASTELLANETA.  THE GOI LEGAL ADVISORS HAVE </p><p>CONFIRMED THERE WAS NO LEGAL OR JURIDICAL OBSTACLE TO SIGNING </p><p>SUCH AN AGREEMENT.  CASTELLANETA SUGGESTED THE OPTION OF </p><p>SIGNING A "ONE-SIDED AGREEMENT" WITH THE USG BY WHICH THE GOI </p><p>WOULD AGREE NOT TO TURN U.S. PERSONNEL OVER TO THE ICC BUT </p><p>WOULD NOT SEEK SIMILAR PROTECTION FOR ITALIAN PERSONNEL FROM </p><p>THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: THIS IS THE MOST POSITIVE RESPONSE EMBASSY </p><p>HAS YET RECEIVED ON THE ISSUE OF AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03796  011602Z </p><p>THE GOI (SEE REFTELS).  IT APPEARS THAT ONCE AGAIN, WHEN </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH ASKS PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI FOR HELP, THE </p><p>HELP IS FORTHCOMING.  DURING HIS ROME CONSULTATIONS ON AUG 5, </p><p>WE RECOMMEND THAT U/S BOLTON FOLLOW UP WITH GOI INTERLOCUTORS </p><p>ON THE USG\'S STRONG INTEREST IN SIGNING A BILATERAL ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT WITH ITALY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ENCOURAGE </p><p>ITALY TO PREVENT A COMMON EU POSITION OPPOSING ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  WE SPECULATE THAT CASTELLANETA\'S SUGGESTION THAT </p><p>WE SIGN A "ONE-SIDED AGREEMENT" COULD BE THE GOI\'S WAY TO </p><p>STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU POSITIONS ON THE </p><p>ICC.  IT MAY OFFER THEM A WAY TO REAFFIRM, TO BOTH ITALIAN </p><p>AND EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION, THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE ICC BY </p><p>DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUBJECT THEIR OWN </p><p>PERSONNEL TO THE COURT, EVEN WHILE HONORING OUR REQUEST TO </p><p>USE OUR OWN COURTS TO TRY ACCUSED US PERSONNEL.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03796 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
