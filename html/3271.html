<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003726 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAL, SOCI, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AND THE SURVEY SAYS . . . GOJ POPULAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On June 23, 2002, the Center for Strategic Studies </p><p>(CSS) at the University of Jordan released the most recent </p><p>iteration of its opinion poll assessing government </p><p>popularity.  The poll indicates that a large segment of the </p><p>Jordanian public continues to support Prime Minister Ali Abul </p><p>Ragheb and his two-year-old government, both on issues </p><p>related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and more </p><p>generally.  Some assert that the poll is flawed, though a </p><p>contact at CSS naturally denies this.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CSS POLL RESULTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CSS has been tracking government popularity since </p><p>1993.  Its most recent poll contains seventeen questions, </p><p>fourteen of which assess public attitudes towards the GOJ\'s </p><p>stand on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and popular support </p><p>for the Abul Ragheb government.  The poll samples two groups, </p><p>a large demographically diverse "national" sample of 1470 </p><p>adults and a smaller sample of 700 opinion leaders -- </p><p>businesspeople, professionals, union leaders, politicians, </p><p>and academics. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The CSS poll indicates that most Jordanians support </p><p>the GOJ\'s strongly pro-Palestinian stand vis-a-vis the </p><p>Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  Nearly two-thirds of </p><p>Jordanians in both polling samples say GOJ policies reflect </p><p>public opinion to a medium or large degree.  In what may be </p><p>the most revealing item in the survey, many respondents (38% </p><p>in the national sample and 58% in the opinion-leader sample) </p><p>believe the GOJ can do nothing to alleviate problems on the </p><p>West Bank.  But even among those who believe the GOJ should </p><p>do more, only a minority (24% in the national sample and 22% </p><p>in the opinion-leader sample) favor severing or threatening </p><p>to sever ties with Israel.  The balances in both groups favor </p><p>moderate measures like sending aid to Palestinians and </p><p>supporting international political initiatives.  Opinions </p><p>within Jordan\'s Palestinian refugee camps mirror responses </p><p>from the rest of the country. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The CSS poll also indicates a fairly high level of </p><p>general support for the Abul Ragheb government.  Around </p><p>two-thirds of Jordanians in both polling groups rate the </p><p>current government\'s "capabilities" as satisfactory or </p><p>better.  This figure is similar to the figures reported in </p><p>the five previous CSS polls assessing support for Abul </p><p>Ragheb\'s government.  On the other hand, respondents list </p><p>unemployment and poverty as two important areas where the </p><p>government should concentrate more effort. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>REACTION TO THE POLL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Reaction to the CSS poll is mixed.  A Jordan Times </p><p>editorial praises Jordanian "sagacity" revealed in </p><p>"reasonable, moderate, realistic and mature" responses to </p><p>polling questions.  On the other hand, one long-time human </p><p>rights contact believes the poll was crafted to "direct" </p><p>results favorable to the government.  The CSS poll results, </p><p>he also says, are worthless because the selection of "opinion </p><p>leaders" is unscientific and susceptible to bias.  One former </p><p>parliamentarian even more cynically opines that the CSS poll </p><p>results are simply "untrue."  "How can we say that the people </p><p>are happy with the government," he asks, "when the government </p><p>has failed to ease the economic pressure they suffer from." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A contact at CSS, Dr. Hassan Barari, defends the poll </p><p>as being carefully designed and professionally administered. </p><p>He denies that polling questions are "leading," or that poll </p><p>results are subject to any outside interference.  As evidence </p><p>of the poll\'s integrity, Barari notes that the GOJ has </p><p>previously adopted the unvarnished results of CSS polls even </p><p>when they were not favorable to it.  In addition, Barari </p><p>says, a reputable and experienced pollster (Tony Sabah) </p><p>oversees CSS polling and CSS\'s credibility is such that it </p><p>now teaches polling techniques to the Government of Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Though CSS is the most respected polling organization </p><p>in Jordan, it remains difficult to reconcile the published </p><p>results of the CSS poll with ground-level sentiment in </p><p>Jordan.  CSS polling questions are not obviously leading or </p><p>misleading, but some questions are so complex that they may </p><p>have generated poorly-considered responses.  (For example, </p><p>one question assessing government popularity asks, in rough </p><p>translation, "To what degree do you believe the government of </p><p>Engineer Ali Abul Ragheb has been capable of shouldering the </p><p>responsibilities of this era, from the time the government </p><p>was formed until now?").  Also, some respondents may have </p><p>feared that their replies would not remain confidential. </p><p>Still, while it may be difficult to say -- based on this poll </p><p>-- whether popular support for the current government is </p><p>strong, the poll does seem to suggest that support for the </p><p>government has remained much the same in recent months, </p><p>despite the turmoil in the region.  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
