<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/THANOS </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, EIND, EMIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PROGRESS ON JORDAN PHOSPHATE MINES PRIVATIZATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The GOJ is moving forward with the privatization of </p><p>the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC), Jordan\'s largest </p><p>company and the largest, single exporter, with plans to sell </p><p>a substantial chunk of the firm to a Canadian company.  If </p><p>successful, the transaction could bring in up to USD70 </p><p>million for Jordan\'s new investment plan.  The sale of the </p><p>ailing monopolist will mark a major milestone in Jordan\'s </p><p>ongoing, yet fitful, privatization process, but will face </p><p>domestic political hurdles.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MORE THAN JUST A MINERAL </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Jordan is the world\'s third largest exporter of </p><p>phosphate, a mineral used in the production of fertilizer. </p><p>In 2001, phosphate and potash (another raw material used in </p><p>fertilizer) exports comprised 17 percent of Jordan\'s domestic </p><p>exports.  The mining sector has historically represented an </p><p>important earner of foreign exchange over the years, as well </p><p>as an important source of revenue in the form of mining fees, </p><p>taxes and dividends, and the GOJ has been loathe to part with </p><p>key contributors such as JPMC as it strives to privatize. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) JPMC is one of the biggest employers in Jordan, but </p><p>losses of USD179 million in 2000 forced JPMC to restructure, </p><p>and 1300 employees (out of 6500) were offered, and accepted, </p><p>early retirement.  Due to a worldwide surplus of phosphate, </p><p>the price of the mineral has dropped over the last three </p><p>years, causing an attendant drop in sales for JPMC.  But </p><p>overstaffing, inefficient production methods and facilities, </p><p>and chronic mismanagement continue to plague JPMC, and the </p><p>company reported net losses of USD 12 million in 2001.  Jobs </p><p>at JPMC have traditionally been a key source of political </p><p>patronage in the southern part of the country, a region whose </p><p>stability is often seen as crucial to the stability of the </p><p>country as a whole.  (For example, when the Aqaba Railway </p><p>Company (ARC) was privatized, 500 unskilled ARC workers were </p><p>hired by JPMC under government directive.)  Under the </p><p>recommendation of the IMF, the company was slated for </p><p>privatization late last year. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ENTER THE CANADIANS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) According to recent press reports, the Canadian </p><p>mining concern Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS) is </p><p>negotiating with the GOJ to buy a stake in the company.  Reem </p><p>Badran, Director of the Jordan Investment Board, confirmed </p><p>that talks were underway.  She told us that, while other </p><p>companies had expressed interest in JPMC, the PCS bid seemed </p><p>to be the most serious.  While PCS has offered to buy the </p><p>GOJ\'s entire 65 percent share of the company, Badran said </p><p>that the GOJ only would sell 40 percent at this time (valued </p><p>at approximately USD70 million at today\'s share price), with </p><p>the Jordan Investment Board retaining approximately 25 </p><p>percent of the company.  The remainder is owned by the </p><p>Jordanian Social Security Corporation, the Kuwait Investment </p><p>Corporation, and other private investors.  Badran added that </p><p>there was as yet no timetable for the deal to be completed. </p><p>(Note: PCS is the largest producer of phosphate in the world.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Even a partial sale of JPMC would give Jordan\'s </p><p>privatization program a much-needed shot in the arm.  A deal </p><p>could not come at a better time, as the GOJ needs money to </p><p>fund the its socio-economic plan, which calls for GOJ </p><p>investment in projects that encourage economic growth.  A </p><p>sale could also demonstrate to the IMF and foreign investors </p><p>alike that the country is ready to break the privatization </p><p>logjam.  But a challenge for a successful new management team </p><p>will be finding a politically acceptable formula for trimming </p><p>down to an efficient, productive work force. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
