<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001504 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PREL, PINS, LA, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  LARGEST DRUG BUST EVER IN VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  In what Vietnam\'s state-controlled media </p><p>reported as the "largest single heroin seizure ever" in </p><p>Vietnam, Quang Tri provincial counternarcotics police seized </p><p>approximately 40 kilograms of heroin entering Vietnam in a </p><p>truck near the Lao Bao border crossing.  Five people are </p><p>under temporary detention and the case is under further </p><p>investigation by Ministry of Public Security\'s </p><p>Counternarcotics Department.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>QUANG TRI -- A DRUG "HOTSPOT" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Quang Tri province is located in central Vietnam and </p><p>shares a 206-kilometer border with Laos.  According to Le </p><p>Thanh Hien, Deputy Director of the Anti-smuggling Department </p><p>of Vietnam\'s General Department of Customs, Quang Tri is a </p><p>drug hotspot due to its proximity to Laos and trafficking </p><p>routes from the Golden Triangle.  Hien said  most drugs that </p><p>come into Quang tri originate in Laos.  From Quang Tri, </p><p>drugs typically make their way north to Hanoi or south to Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City, either via Highway 1 or by train, he added. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>CASE BACKGROUND </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to the "Labor" newspaper, Quang Tri </p><p>counternarcotics police detected the case on June 9 near the </p><p>Lao Bao international border gate.  They discovered a truck </p><p>entering from Laos had 40 kilogram of heroin hidden among </p><p>other goods.  (Note:  During all of 2002, GVN law </p><p>enforcement entities seized only about 55 kilograms of </p><p>heroin.  end note)   Section Chief Le Van Truong of MPS\' </p><p>Counternarcotics Department, confirmed that this was the </p><p>biggest single seizure ever recorded in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>COULD THERE BE MORE? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  According to Customs\' Hien, MPS, the Border Army, </p><p>and Customs have now been tasked to investigate other </p><p>possible links to this seizure.  Hien added that authorities </p><p>hope that the suspects arrested will lead them to other drug </p><p>activity in the area.  He predicted that a trial would take </p><p>place in about six months, culminating in "several" death </p><p>sentences.  (Note:  Under Vietnam\'s drug law, anyone found </p><p>in possession of 100 grams or more of heroin may be </p><p>sentenced to death.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  While relatively impressive, this seizure lends </p><p>credence to what DEA Hanoi Country Office, the UN, and </p><p>international law enforcement agencies have been saying for </p><p>years - the seizure rate in Vietnam is abysmally low </p><p>considering the estimated amounts of drugs transiting </p><p>Vietnam\'s long, porous borders with its neighbors.  In </p><p>addition, the relatively little press coverage -- during </p><p>"drug awareness month" -- is both puzzling and </p><p>disappointing.  Despite this successful seizure, there has </p><p>not been any noticeable change in MPS\' general lack of </p><p>operational cooperation with DEA.  Even several attempts to </p><p>obtain additional information regarding this specific </p><p>seizure have proven fruitless.  As in the past, GVN </p><p>counternarcotics authorities have told DEA that Vietnam\'s </p><p>secrecy laws prohibit them from disseminating "sensitive </p><p>information" to foreign agencies. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  This message has been cleared by the DEA Hanoi </p><p>Country Office. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
