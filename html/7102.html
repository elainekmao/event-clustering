<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Butchering of Iraqi civilians </p><p>      worrying" the independent weekly "Business Tribune" </p><p>      dedicated its April 3 editorial to describing the </p><p>      United States-led war against Iraq as "one big- </p><p>      enterprise in manslaughter."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The description by a wounded British soldier who </p><p>      survived friendly fire last weekend should give </p><p>      everybody an insight into how painful war </p><p>      is. . .  Thousands and thousands of Iraqi women </p><p>      and children are experiencing the pain he felt </p><p>      and the noise he would never want to hear again. </p><p>      (Lance Corporal of Horse Steven) Gerrard\'s </p><p>      cowardice is obvious.  He does not wish to </p><p>      experience the pain of war while inflicting it </p><p>      on innocent civilians.  This unfortunately has </p><p>      become the character of the coalition\'s invasion </p><p>      of Iraq.  American soldiers especially have </p><p>      begun to show this cowardice more and more as </p><p>      they kill innocent civilians trying to run away </p><p>      from the conflict.  Their cowboy-style </p><p>      checkpoint shootings show a cowardly approach to </p><p>      the war that might well turn public opinion </p><p>      against them. . .  The war has become dirty and </p><p>      this had not been factored into the `shock and </p><p>      awe\' strategy.  Obviously now the invaders have </p><p>      crossed the Rubicon and cannot therefore retreat </p><p>      without their ultimate trophy, Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>      scalp.  But the world should be very worried by </p><p>      the butchering of innocent people.  The Gerrard </p><p>      incident shows the invasion of Iraq is one big- </p><p>      enterprise in manslaughter." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
