SUMMARY:  UAE AND REGIONAL MEDIA FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON IRAQ. </p><p>HOWEVER, EDITORIALS COMMENTED ON THE PALESTINIANS AND THE LONDON </p><p>CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS PALESTINIAN REFORMS.  MEDIA CRITICIZED </p><p>ISRAEL\'S DECISION TO BAR SEVERAL PALESTINIANS FROM ATTENDING THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WHILE ALLOWING THEIR PARTICIPATION VIA DIGITAL VIDEO </p><p>CONFERENCE.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL ARGUED THAT ISRAELI </p><p>SOCIETY BELIEVES THE ELIMINATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IS THE </p><p>ONLY SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE.  LIKEWISE, AN "AKHBAR AL </p><p>ARAB" EDITORIAL DESCRIBED THE LONDON CONFERENCE AS A CHEAP </p><p>ATTEMPT TO BRIBE ARABS BEFORE THE WAR ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE LABOR PARTY\'S SURPRISE FOR THE POPULARITY </p><p>OF THE LIKUD PARTY, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI OFFICIAL "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO WONDER WHY SHARON\'S POPULARITY </p><p>INCREASES, SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS REFLECTS THE GENERAL MOOD OF AN </p><p>ISRAELI SOCIETY BENT ON WAR.  THIS SOCIETY BELIEVES POWER AND </p><p>BLOODSHED ARE THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE, </p><p>INCLUDING THE ELIMINATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE LONDON CONFERENCE TO REFORM THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT WE ARE AFRAID OF IS THAT THE LONDON CONFERENCE IS A </p><p>CHEAP ATTEMPT TO BRIBE ARABS (TO SUPPORT) THE U.S.- U.K. MILITARY </p><p>BUILD-UP BEFORE THE WAR ON IRAQ.  IT IS MORE PRACTICAL FOR THE </p><p>LONDON CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO </p><p>FIND A NEW FORMULA TO REBUILD THE INSTITUTIONS DESTROYED BY </p><p>OCCUPATION BEFORE STARTING A SURREAL DIALOGUE ON WHO IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR REFORMING THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
