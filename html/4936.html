<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL, SIMS AND FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: WHY NYAROTA WAS FIRED; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   On December 31, 2002 Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe </p><p>      (ANZ), publishers of the "Daily News," fired Geoffrey </p><p>      Nyarota, the paper\'s much-lauded founding Editor-in-Chief. </p><p>      Local and international media outlets have since been </p><p>      speculating about what caused this sudden editorial shake- </p><p>      up at Zimbabwe\'s only independent daily newspaper. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   In an article published in the January 2 edition of </p><p>      the British-based "Guardian" newspaper, Nyarota alleges </p><p>      that he was dismissed as a "trade off for the registration </p><p>      of the ANZ titles" under the controversial Access to </p><p>      Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  Nyarota </p><p>      implies that the ANZ board were pressured by the Ministry </p><p>      of Information and its Media Commission (responsible for </p><p>      licensing both media houses and individual journalists) to </p><p>      fire Nyarota in order to obtain the licensing necessary to </p><p>      continue publishing in 2003.  This version of events also </p><p>      appears in the January 3 edition of the weekly Zimbabwe </p><p>      Independent. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   However, on the front page of the January 3 edition of </p><p>      the "Daily News," ANZ management explains that Nyarota was </p><p>      dismissed for allegedly supporting a ten-day industrial </p><p>      action that crippled the newspaper and prevented its </p><p>      publication for nine days.  According to the Executive </p><p>      Chairman of ANZ, Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, Nyarota was "booted </p><p>      out because he forked out Z$9,4 million from his own pocket </p><p>      to pay ANZ workers who were on strike."  Nkomo has also </p><p>      dismissed Nyarota\'s attempt to blame the government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe for his dismissal saying: "We are greatly saddened </p><p>      by this attempt to twist what is clearly a labor matter </p><p>      between Geoffrey Nyarota and ANZ into a political issue." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   "ANZ has not applied to register under AIPPA, because </p><p>      ANZ\'s lawyers are making final touches to a court </p><p>      application to challenge the constitutionality of the </p><p>      registration provisions.  No trade-off is possible for us </p><p>      on the legitimacy of AIPPA," Nkomo is quoted as saying at a </p><p>      press conference in Harare yesterday (January 2).  The </p><p>      January 3 edition of the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" also carried a similar story on page one under </p><p>      headline "Nyarota blames government for dismissal." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Comment: Nyarota\'s dismissal from the "Daily News" has </p><p>      dominated the Zimbabwean media this week.  Post will </p><p>      continue to monitor the story and to speak to the actors </p><p>      involved in order to clarify the true cause of this </p><p>      editorial shake-up.  Like many readers, we will be </p><p>      scrutinizing the copy of the "Daily" in coming weeks to </p><p>      determine whether its new editorial team will abandon </p><p>      Nyarota\'s fiercely independent and critical stance. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
