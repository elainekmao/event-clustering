The independent weekly "The </p><p>Standard" broke the story in the March 9 edition.  The </p><p>paper carried the article on page two under headline "U. S. </p><p>Freezes Mugabe and cronies\' assets.  The March 10 edition </p><p>of the pro-government "Daily Mirror" picked up a Reuters </p><p>article and published it on page two under headline "U.
