<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SNAPSHOT OF NORTHERN GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: As with the Presidential contest, </p><p>most Northern gubernatorial elections will be fought </p><p>between the two major parties in Nigeria, the ruling </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Nigerians </p><p>Peoples Party (ANPP).  Overall, ANPP candidates are </p><p>expected to benefit from the popularity of General </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari in the region.  While some incumbent </p><p>governors (particularly Benue and Plateau) have been </p><p>accused of incompetence, others are facing opposition </p><p>from the local elite and power-brokers.  In some states </p><p>(Borno, Jigawa and Kaduna), intra-party squabbles </p><p>arising from rancorous gubernatorial primaries have </p><p>generated deep divisions within parties that will </p><p>adversely affect candidates at the polls.  Some places </p><p>the incumbent will likely win because the opposition </p><p>parties are weak and disorganized.  A few governors </p><p>(Katsina and Sokoto) are simply popular at the </p><p>grassroots and would be difficult to defeat.  In the </p><p>end, we expect the majority of incumbents to return. </p><p>This is a brief rundown of a few of the key races in </p><p>the North.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ADAMAWA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Vice President Atiku Abubakar is Adamawa\'s </p><p>kingpin, and he is very close to the Lamido </p><p>(traditional ruler).  But his coattails may not be as </p><p>long as is commonly assumed.  The VP\'s popularity in </p><p>some areas of this state is low.  Incumbent governor </p><p>Boni Haruna is not well liked and is running against a </p><p>popular ANPP Candidate, Adamu Moddibo.  Bala Takaya, a </p><p>political science professor and established politician, </p><p>is flying the AD flag.  Takaya is popular with </p><p>Christians and intellectuals.  Many believe he won the </p><p>election in 1999 but was wrongfully denied victory by </p><p>vote tampering.  Takaya comes from the same senatorial </p><p>district as the governor;  thus, they will split that </p><p>area, which will benefit Modibbo (the only Muslim among </p><p>the three in a state that is probably more than half </p><p>Muslim).  This should be a close race.  An easy victory </p><p>by Haruna would quickly precipitate cries of electoral </p><p>fraud and violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>BAUCHI </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Incumbent governor Adamu Mu\'azu (PDP) has been </p><p>an able administrator; he also is popular throughout </p><p>the state.  However, this race will not be a push-over. </p><p>The ANPP had a strong presence in the State and some </p><p>observers believe the party has an edge over the PDP. </p><p>Buhari\'s coat tails will help the ANPP.  However, </p><p>Mu\'azu\'s incumbency advantage and the PDP\'s </p><p>determination to win suggest the governor will return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>BENUE </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Benue is the home of the Tiv, the largest ethnic </p><p>group in the Middle Belt.  Governor George Akume (PDP) </p><p>has many problems with which to contend. Akume\'s </p><p>inability to bring many development projects to his </p><p>state has fueled accusations of incompetence.  His </p><p>kinsmen have questioned his relationship with President </p><p>Obasanjo, whom they blame for the October 2001 Zaki- </p><p>Biam massacre. Akume faces an enemy in his former </p><p>mentor, the notoriously corrupt former PDP Chairman </p><p>Chief Barnabas Gemade, who supported Akume financially </p><p>in 1999. Gemade and Akume parted ways when Akume </p><p>supported Obasanjo at this year\'s PDP convention.  In </p><p>spite of these problems, Akume might win if he gets the </p><p>support of the Idoma.  The Idoma are the second largest </p><p>ethnic group in the State and control one of three </p><p>senatorial zones.  PDP National Chairman Audu Ogbeh is </p><p>Idoma, and observers expect Idomas to vote PDP.  If </p><p>Akume can win the Idoma bloc vote, he will have the </p><p>inside track on his two major opponents, Paul Unongo </p><p>(ANPP) and Mike Mku (UNPP); both of Akume\'s opponents </p><p>are Tiv, and they will likely split the Tiv vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>BORNO </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Incumbent governor Mala Kachalla is running on </p><p>the AD ticket after losing the ANPP primary to Senator </p><p>Ali Sheriff, his former financier.  Sheriff has </p><p>invested a great deal of time, energy and resources in </p><p>building a political machine in the State and should </p><p>win a close race.  Kachalla still has the support of </p><p>the political elite, but is disliked by civil servants </p><p>in the state.  PDP Candidate Kashim Ibrahim Imam, a </p><p>well-regarded PDP operative, is likely to come in </p><p>third; Borno is not a must-win state for the ruling </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>KADUNA </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kaduna is the historic political center of the </p><p>North.  Many influential Northern politicians, </p><p>businessmen, military and civil servants have </p><p>residences in Kaduna city.  Today, Kaduna state is </p><p>almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. </p><p>The current contest is between incumbent governor Ahmed </p><p>Mohammed Makarfi (PDP) and his former Finance </p><p>Commissioner, Suleiman Hunkuyi (ANPP).  It will be </p><p>close.  The ANPP is very strong in the State, and </p><p>Buhari\'s coattails are long.  Makarfi\'s performance has </p><p>been good and efforts to quell ethnic unrest in the </p><p>state may help him retain his job.  He may be the </p><p>choice of mostly-Christian Southern Kaduna, where his </p><p>creation of first-class chieftancies for local </p><p>traditional rulers gained him support there but </p><p>temporarily put him at odds with the influential Zaria </p><p>Emirate.  Makarfi\'s move to reconcile with his former </p><p>adversary, Shehu Idris, the Emir of Zazzau (Zaria), and </p><p>other senior PDP figures has greatly enhanced his </p><p>chances of winning.  However, Makarfi will have to </p><p>contend with the strong opposition to Obasanjo in the </p><p>northern Kaduna, Makarfi\'s home turf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>KANO </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) With over four million registered voters, Kano </p><p>is the most populous state in the region, and its </p><p>capital city is the commercial center of the North.  In </p><p>1999, PDP won the governorship race and most of the </p><p>Assembly seats.  A firm Obasanjo ally, Governor Rabiu </p><p>Musa Kwankwaso has had problems with most of the </p><p>political heavyweights in the state, including Speaker </p><p>of the House Ghali Na\'abba (who just lost his </p><p>reelection bid in part due to Kwankwaso\'s opposition). </p><p>Minister of Labor Musa Gwadabe and former Governor </p><p>Abubakar Rimi also dislike Kwankwaso.  Many locals are </p><p>angry with the governor for not backing Rimi\'s quixotic </p><p>bid for the PDP Presidential nomination.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>popularity in Kano is very low because of failures to </p><p>address social and economic problems; many industries </p><p>have closed and thousands of workers have been laid- </p><p>off.  Both the city and the state benefited during the </p><p>years of Abacha\'s rule, as the deceased dictator called </p><p>Kano home. This anti-Obasanjo sentiment will hurt the </p><p>Governor in Kano city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Kwankwaso is stronger in the rural areas, but </p><p>his support for Obasanjo will cost him some votes there </p><p>as well.  Finally, although the steam is slowly </p><p>escaping from the political Sharia boiler, its </p><p>advocates retain their influence and continue to </p><p>smolder over Kwankwaso\'s lukewarm endorsement of their </p><p>movement.  These factors, coupled with Buhari\'s </p><p>coattails working for the ANPP mean that the incumbent </p><p>would lose a fair race, even though the ANPP was long </p><p>bitterly divided over its gubernatorial candidate.  The </p><p>deciding factor is whether the race indeed will be </p><p>fair.  It probably will not be.  To rebuild the PDP in </p><p>the North after the election, Obasanjo and the PDP will </p><p>have to demonstrate that they can return favors to </p><p>their strong supporters (like Kwankwaso). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>KATSINA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Katsina is the home of General Buhari.  He will </p><p>push hard to make sure his party wins.  Governor Umaru </p><p>Yar\'Adua (PDP) is respected and has performed well. </p><p>However, Obasanjo and the PDP are unpopular </p><p>(notwithstanding INEC vote counts from the April 12 </p><p>elections that might suggest otherwise), and Buhari </p><p>(son of the soil) is the overwhelming choice.  Were the </p><p>Presidential race not part of election day, the well- </p><p>regarded Yar\'Adua would probably be able to overcome </p><p>the PDP\'s Obasanjo handicap easily.  Even with the </p><p>Buhari factor working against him, he has the GON and </p><p>the national PDP pulling levers for him.  He should </p><p>pull off a squeaker over the ANPP\'s Nura Khalil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>KWARA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) A week ago, we would not have wanted to call </p><p>this race; it was just too close.  Both principal </p><p>candidates had strong negatives, lots of money and </p><p>hundreds of thugs.  But with the PDP\'s April 12 </p><p>performance in the state, an ANPP victory seems less </p><p>likely now unless the AD candidate should (improbably) </p><p>withdraw in favor of Governor Mohammed Lawal or Lawal </p><p>should (and this is more likely) resort to widespread </p><p>intimidation of voters in Kwara Central, the power base </p><p>of his enemy, wealthy banker and former Presidential </p><p>aspirant Dr. Olusola Saraki.  Saraki\'s son is running </p><p>for Governor, and his daughter recently claimed the </p><p>Senate seat for Kwara Central. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>PLATEAU </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Incumbent governor Joshua Dariye (PDP) is </p><p>embattled.  He has performed poorly and is a divisive </p><p>political figure in a divided state.  He has poured </p><p>salt into Plateau\'s ethnic and religious wounds instead </p><p>of salving them.  Dariye faces strong opposition from </p><p>every direction.  Civil servants who have not been paid </p><p>salaries for months have vowed to resist his comeback </p><p>bid and are supporting the AD\'s Damishi Sango, former </p><p>Minister of Sports.  Sango is supported by Solomon Lar. </p><p>Lar, a corrupt former PDP Chairman, is perhaps the most </p><p>influential politician in the state.  Plateau, </p><p>particularly Langtang, is the home of many retired </p><p>generals who are publicly active.  They support the </p><p>ANPP Candidate, General Jang. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SOKOTO </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Sokoto is the spiritual capital of the Northern </p><p>Muslim community; it is the seat of the famous Sokoto </p><p>Caliphate.  By all accounts, Sokoto will be retained by </p><p>the ANPP.  Governor Attahiru Bafarawa may be almost </p><p>incoherent when he speaks the English language, but he </p><p>is politically comfortable and his opponent is weak. </p><p>Bafarawa is widely seen as an "IBB Boy" in a state </p><p>where the former military ruler remains popular. </p><p>During the introduction of Shari\'a, the Governor </p><p>maintained a cordial relationship with the minority </p><p>Christian community.  Bafarawa was the first northern </p><p>governor that openly criticized the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration for discriminating against the North. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s opponents in the North applauded this speech </p><p>and Bafarawa instantly became a northern hero. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
