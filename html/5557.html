<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000257 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AUDITOR GENERAL REPORT HITS THE MEDIA; </p><p>IMPACT ON CORRUPTION LESS CLEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 ABUJA 1606 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  The Auditor General of the Federation </p><p>(AGF), akin to an Inspector General in the USG, has recently </p><p>released the Audit Report for Calendar Year 2001 (Part One). </p><p>Citing malfeasance in all tiers of government, the report has </p><p>gained notoriety in the media and spawned calls from the </p><p>President and civil society for greater transparency in </p><p>government. The report itself is an undigested listing of </p><p>irregularities found by the AGF\'s 700 professional auditors </p><p>including such examples as: </p><p>- a) $45,000 in unaccounted funds budgeted by the Federal </p><p>Capital Territory to buy gifts for a canceled State visit by </p><p>Libyan leader Muammar Qadaffi; and </p><p>-  b) U.S. $20,000 given to Ministry of Police Affairs </p><p>police officials without proper authorization or accounting. </p><p>Misappropriations and financial irregularities identified by </p><p>the Auditor were not followed up in the past for various </p><p>reasons, chiefly lack of political will.  Acting Auditor </p><p>General of the Federation Azie believes this report,s fate </p><p>will be different. However, there will certainly be </p><p>resistance to the report\'s recommendations and many in </p><p>government are not pleased by the release of the report </p><p>before elections. Already, Information Minister Jerry Gana </p><p>publicly dismissed the audit as "rash" and calculated to </p><p>embarrass the GON. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  On January 13, newspapers reported that the Auditor </p><p>General had forwarded to the National Assembly his report </p><p>covering government accounts for calendar year 2001.  The </p><p>audit reportedly charged the executive, legislature, and the </p><p>judiciary with numerous fiscal and procedural improprieties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Meeting with EconOff on January 21, Acting Auditor </p><p>General V.S.C. Azie said the report was provided to the </p><p>National Assembly pursuant to the constitution.  He was </p><p>unsure whether he was authorized to release the report to the </p><p>public or to foreign diplomats. Refusing to provide a copy, </p><p>Azie however allowed EconOff to view a copy of the report </p><p>when asked, and promised to make it available as soon as the </p><p>"media heat" cooled off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) To back up his claim that the Auditor General\'s office </p><p>is committed to transparency, Azie showed EconOff mock-ups of </p><p>the website he hopes to launch in February.  There, he </p><p>explained, the report would be made available to the general </p><p>public.  More than 270 pages long, the report contains no </p><p>executive summary and cites individual irregularities by </p><p>Ministry or agency. The report is a difficult read, the </p><p>editing is poor and narrative consistency is lacking.  More </p><p>importantly, there was little effort made to clearly define </p><p>the elements of each offence reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Acting Auditor General explained that Part Two of </p><p>the Report would contain more analysis and interpretation. </p><p>However, completion of that section would require more </p><p>information from the Accountant General of the Federation. </p><p>He speculated this might take two or three years.  Rather </p><p>than wait for the second part, as had been the custom, he </p><p>believed it would be better to publish the raw information as </p><p>soon as possible.  He forwarded that section of the report to </p><p>the National Assembly in hopes that his action would lead to </p><p>the public dissemination of the raw audit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Azie acknowledged his office has no prosecutorial </p><p>powers and only makes recommendations to the National </p><p>Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which has to pursue </p><p>the individual cases.  When asked if this would be effective </p><p>given the erratic performance of the National Assembly, Azie </p><p>was upbeat.  He claimed some cases were pursued by the House </p><p>PAC from the 1997 Audit (the last available) and that the </p><p>legislators had identified agencies and individuals who </p><p>indeed made restitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) With fresh information from the 2001 audit, Azie </p><p>believes the House PAC could resolve many cases.  He </p><p>explained that many times individuals and Ministries refused </p><p>to even answer queries from the auditors.  The PAC had the </p><p>power to subpoena individuals and, if necessary, refer them </p><p>for criminal prosecution, though this step has never been </p><p>taken.  In contrast to the House, the Senate Public Accounts </p><p>Committee was moribund and had not taken any action, Azie </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Azie\'s best case scenario saw his office coordinating </p><p>with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related </p><p>Offences Commission (ICPC), and the Budget Price Monitoring </p><p>and Investigation Unit (BMPI) in the President,s office </p><p>(reftel), to reduce corruption by making the contract </p><p>tendering processes for capital projects more transparent. </p><p>This could not happen overnight, but with continued increases </p><p>in resources and support from the top, it would eventually </p><p>make a difference and begin to change behavior in government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constraints on the Auditor\'s Office </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Azie decried the lack of protection for auditors and </p><p>whistleblowers who vigorously pursue corruption.  While </p><p>auditors work for him, their offices are often located in the </p><p>Ministries and agencies they investigate.  An aggressive </p><p>auditor could wind up in a "living hell" if he upsets too </p><p>many people, and there is little the Auditor General\'s Office </p><p>can do to protect or even transfer them to other government </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Azie also complained that his office is underfunded, </p><p>making it difficult to carry out some of its functions. </p><p>Though there is a new training program  from the World Bank, </p><p>Azie noted the Auditor General\'s office had received very </p><p>little training in the last 15 years despite the GON policy </p><p>of setting aside ten percent of the annual personnel costs </p><p>for training.  However, Azie advises his staff to personally </p><p>train themselves, including extension and on-line courses, </p><p>since the government is not ready to make funds available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Perhaps in response to extensive and sensational </p><p>press coverage of the report, the audit was discussed at the </p><p>weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting of January 29. </p><p>President Obasanjo directed all Ministries to immediately </p><p>respond to the Public Accounts Committee of the National </p><p>Assembly with explanations of the anomalies identified in the </p><p>document. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  However, the Executive seemed to be of two minds </p><p>regarding the report. That same afternoon, Information </p><p>Minister Gana briefed the media that the report was intended </p><p>to embarrass the Federal Government.  He dismissed the report </p><p>as an unprofessional audit that levied charges without regard </p><p>for due process and accuracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Gana further claimed that the Auditor General did not </p><p>give the Ministries the opportunity to provide detailed </p><p>explanations before the report was submitted to the National </p><p>Assembly.  He challenged Azie\'s professional competence </p><p>saying "it would appear that the Auditor General was in some </p><p>kind of haste to rush out the report because there are three </p><p>phases which he never followed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Comment: While the recent report generated much </p><p>discussion among the general public, Azie\'s quest to make a </p><p>positive impact from his revelations will be an uphill </p><p>struggle. Things are rarely straightforward in Nigeria and </p><p>this maxim applies doubly to the topics of corruption and </p><p>malfeasance during an election year.  No doubt, many National </p><p>Assembly Members probably were happy to receive the report, </p><p>it was the glee of a wrongdoer who has caught his accuser in </p><p>a similar transgression.  National Assembly members believe </p><p>the Presidency has used the ICPC to target the Assembly </p><p>leadership and other members the Presidency opposes; now, </p><p>they probably are looking at Azie\'s report as an instrument </p><p>to blunt the President,s actions against them. Because the </p><p>report provides information about executive branch </p><p>corruption, the Assembly will likely use it to deter vigorous </p><p>pursuit of House members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Instead of advancing the battle against </p><p>corruption, the most likely short-term effect of the report </p><p>will be relative inaction based on a sort of executive and </p><p>legislative branch mutually assured political embarrassment </p><p>through public disclosure of corrupt practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) There is also the possibility that the President </p><p>may signal to the House PAC that some of his Ministers are </p><p>more expendable than others. This way he could use the report </p><p>to provide the political cover to rid himself of deadwood </p><p>Ministers.  If some of his Ministers were allowed to walk the </p><p>plank, this could actually enhance Obasanjo,s reputation for </p><p>fighting corruption.  Moreover, albeit done for less than </p><p>noble reasons, this would still constitute genuine progress </p><p>in the fight against corruption. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
