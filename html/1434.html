IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p>(UNDP) RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO BRIEFED </p><p>DIPLOMATIC HEADS OF MISSION AND SELECTED AID DIRECTORS </p><p>DECEMBER 19 ON THE CONTENTS OF ADMINISTRATOR MARK </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE TOLD THE </p><p>GATHERING THAT HE HAD DETECTED A SHIFT IN ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTITUDES TOWARD ENGAGING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY ON LAND REFORM FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE </p><p>RECENT EXTRAORDINARY ZANU-PF CONGRESS.  MINISTER OF </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING </p><p>IGNATIUS CHOMBO HAD ASSURED HIM THAT NEW INVASIONS OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS WOULD STOP, "DEMONSTRATORS" ON UNLISTED </p><p>AND FOREIGN OWNER FARMS WOULD BE REMOVED, AND THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS\' VIOLENCE AND DEATH THREATS WOULD CEASE.  THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) ALSO PERCEIVED A CHANGE </p><p>IN GOVERNMENT DISPOSITION AND REACTED QUICKLY, PUTTING </p><p>TOGETHER AN ARMS-LENGTH NEGOTIATING TEAM TO EXPLORE A </p><p>WAY FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNMENT, ANGELO REPORTED.  OTHER </p><p>SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED SIMILAR SIGNS OF MOVEMENT FROM </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GENERAL REACTION TO ANGELO\'S NEWS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07163  01 OF 03  201212Z </p><p>WAS ONE OF SKEPTICISM.  WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE OUR </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE UNDP INITIATIVE, OUR VIEW OF A GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONVERSION TO THE RULE OF LAW IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAN </p><p>THAT OF VICTOR ANGELO.  WE SEE GOVERNMENT ADHERENCE TO </p><p>RULE OF LAW IN THE BIKITA WEST BY-ELECTION AND CABINET\'S </p><p>REACTION TO THE MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER AS KEY INDICATORS </p><p>THAT HARARE IS READY TO DEAL CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH US ON </p><p>LAND REFORM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING A MEETING DECEMBER 19 TO BRIEF HEADS OF </p><p>MISSION AND SELECTED AID DIRECTORS ON UNDP ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>MARK MALLOCH-BROWN\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>(REFTEL), RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO REPORTED </p><p>A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE FROM KEY ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>PLAYERS ON THE LAND QUESTION FOLLOWING THE JUST- </p><p>CONCLUDED ZANU-PF EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS.  ANGELO CITED </p><p>A MEETING HE HAD HAD DECEMBER 18 WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING MINISTER IGNATIUS </p><p>CHOMBO, HEAD OF THE GOZ\'S LAND TASK FORCE, WHOSE BODY </p><p>LANGUAGE AND REACTIONS TO A VERBAL PRESENTATION OF THE </p><p>CONTENTS OF MALLOCH-BROWN\'S LETTER THE FORMER FOUND </p><p>"ENCOURAGING."  THE MINISTER REPORTEDLY CHARACTERIZED </p><p>THE CURRENT CONJUNCTURE IN ZIMBABWE AS THE "MOST SERIOUS </p><p>AND COMPLEX SINCE INDEPENDENCE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE, </p><p>CHOMBO SAID THAT HE WOULD MAKE OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>A TEAM THAT WOULD BE WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING THE LAND </p><p>REFORM IN A MORE ORGANIZED WAY.  THE MINISTER INFORMED </p><p>ANGELO THAT HE HAD EARLIER THAT DAY MET WITH THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS\' LEADERSHIP AND SENIOR COMMANDERS FROM THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07163  01 OF 03  201212Z </p><p>MILITARY, THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION AND THE </p><p>POLICE.  IN THE GATHERING, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC </p><p>WORKS AND HOUSING MINISTER REPORTEDLY CONVEYED A REQUEST </p><p>FROM PRESIDENT MUGABE HIMSELF THAT THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>REMOVE "DEMONSTRATORS" FROM COMMERCIAL FARMS THAT HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN LISTED OR FROM FARMS THAT WERE AGRIBUSINESS </p><p>CONCERNS.  FURTHERMORE, HE ASKED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION TO STOP </p><p>MAKING DEATH THREATS, AND CEASE SANCTIONING THE USE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND THEIR FARM </p><p>WORKERS.  THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE TOLD THE </p><p>MINISTER THAT HE TOOK NOTE OF THE INFORMATION AND WOULD </p><p>MONITOR PROGRESS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION ON THE GROUND. </p><p>CHOMBO AND OTHERS "IN THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE" HAD BEEN </p><p>SENDING SIGNALS THE PAST TWO WEEKS THAT LINES OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION WERE NOT CLOSED, ANGELO CONTINUED, AND </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN STUDYING </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN\'S PROPOSALS.  MOREOVER, THE UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PLANNED TO </p><p>"DE-LIST" FARMS THAT FELL UNDER THE ZIMBABWE INVESTMENT </p><p>CENTER AND AGRIBUSINESS (I.E., FOREIGN OWNED INTERESTS). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8944 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07163  02 OF 03  201213Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   SS-00    STR-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------ADC6D2  201213Z /38 </p><p>P 201212Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7884 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 007163 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.

(C) THE CFU HAD DETECTED A SHIFT IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>DISPOSITION AS WELL, ANGELO REPORTED.  THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>HAD APPOINTED A THREE-PERSON TEAM, CONSISTING OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT ENJOYED </p><p>THE TRUST OF BOTH SIDES, TO ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AND REPORT TO THE CFU LEADERSHIP.  THE </p><p>RATIONALE OF FORMING THE TEAM WAS TO GIVE IT SOME </p><p>AUTONOMY OF ACTION, TO KEEP THE CFU LEADERSHIP AT ARM\'S </p><p>LENGTH, AND TO AVOID EXPOSING THE LEADERSHIP FURTHER. </p><p>ANGELO CONCLUDED THAT THE CFU HAD TWO CHOICES: TO </p><p>CONTINUE WITH ITS COURT CASES AND WIN THEM BUT LOSE THE </p><p>BATTLE, OR RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES OUTSIDE THE COURTS </p><p>AND SKETCH OUT A WAY FORWARD.  ANGELO ENDORSED THE </p><p>LATTER SORT OF PRAGMATISM WITHIN A SERIOUS SITUATION. </p><p>THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR CONCURRED REGARDING THE MARKED </p><p>DIFFERENCE IN THE CFU LEADERSHIP\'S MOOD.  HE SPECULATED </p><p>THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT, IN SPITE OF </p><p>THE VITUPERATIVE TIRADES AGAINST THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>AND WHITES IN GENERAL, THE PARTY CONGRESS HAD CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF WILL NOT WIN WITH THE FAST TRACK LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BUTTRESSING THE FOREGOING SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>EASING OF THE GOZ\'S HARD-LINE STANCE, ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>LEADING AND VERY WELL-CONNECTED ECONOMIC COMMENTATORS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07163  02 OF 03  201213Z </p><p>TOLD ECONOFF ON DECEMBER 19 THAT HE HAD SEEN DEFINITE </p><p>SIGNS OVER THE LAST WEEK THAT TOP LEADERSHIP HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED THE ISSUE AT CABINET LEVEL, AND APPARENTLY </p><p>AGREED TO AT LEAST ENGAGE IN SERIOUS DIALOGUE.  SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI AND NKOSONA MOYO (THE FINANCE AND TRADE </p><p>MINISTERS), VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA AND MIDLANDS </p><p>PROVINCE GOVERNOR CEPHAS MSIPA, ALL SEPARATELY TOLD THE </p><p>ECONOMIST THAT THE GOVERNMENT AT LEAST WANTED TO ENGAGE </p><p>IN DIALOGUE AND EXPLORE A POSSIBLE FACE-SAVING WAY </p><p>FORWARD.  SOME ISSUES, SUCH AS A RETURN TO THE WILLING </p><p>SELLER-WILLING BUYER BASIS AND COMPENSATION FOR THE LAND </p><p>WERE NON-NEGOTIABLE; HOWEVER THE INVASIONS COULD BE </p><p>SLOWED DOWN OR SUSPENDED IF THERE WOULD BE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT.  THREE OF THE </p><p>FOUR EMPHASIZED THAT EVICTIONS (OF THE RESETTLED) COULD </p><p>NOT TAKE PLACE, BUT THE WAR VETERANS\' ARDOR COULD BE </p><p>TONED DOWN.  AS AN OUTWARD MANIFESTATION OF THIS </p><p>TACTICAL SHIFT, THE ECONOMIST POINTED OUT THAT IN A </p><p>SPEECH DELIVERED AT A MILITARY SCHOOL OFFICER </p><p>COMMISSIONING CEREMONY ON DECEMBER 16 IN GWERU ON THE </p><p>HEELS OF THE PARTY CONGRESS, PRESIDENT MUGABE TOLD THE </p><p>AUDIENCE IN SHONA THAT NO ADDITIONAL INVASIONS SHOULD </p><p>OCCUR, AND THAT THE RESETTLED NEEDED TO CONSOLIDATE </p><p>THEIR GAINS AND WORK ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE GENERAL DONOR REACTION TO ANGELO\'S NEWS WAS </p><p>MIXED, TENDING TOWARD THE SKEPTICAL AND WE\'LL-BELIEVE- </p><p>IT-WHEN-WE-SEE-IT.  THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED </p><p>MINISTER CHOMBO\'S OSTENSIBLE ASSURANCES AS "WISHFUL </p><p>THINKING."  THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\'S REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>REMINDED THOSE ASSEMBLED THAT THE PARTY CONGRESS FULLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07163  02 OF 03  201213Z </p><p>BACKED THE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  THE DANISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID, "IT MAY BE TOO LATE FOR US.  THE </p><p>TAXPAYERS AND THE POLITICIANS HAVE HEARD THE RHETORIC," </p><p>AND WILL NOT HELP THE CURRENT ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>ANGELO\'S FINAL COMMENT BACKPEDALED FROM HIS EARLIER </p><p>ATTEMPT TO SPIN SOME OPTIMISM, "I DIDN\'T SAY THAT THERE </p><p>WAS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL; I SAID THAT WE WERE </p><p>IN A TUNNEL..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  WE ARE PREPARED TO FOLLOW THE MALLOCH- </p><p>BROWN INITIATIVE AS FAR AS IT GOES.  THAT SAID, WE </p><p>DETECT A SHIFT IN GOAL POSTS MORE THAN ATTITUDES OR </p><p>BEHAVIOR HERE.  OUR CONCERN ABOUT RULE OF LAW IS NO </p><p>LONGER FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON LAND.  WE MUST LOOK AT </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION AND THAT </p><p>LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE JANUARY 13-14 BIKITA BY-ELECTION, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROBABLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL INVALIDATION </p><p>OF THE ELECTORAL CHALLENGES BY PRESIDENTIAL DECREE, THE </p><p>THREATS ON THE JUDICIARY FROM ALL SIDES, AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S RACE-BAITING AND IGNORING ORDERS FROM THE </p><p>HIGH AND SUPREME COURTS.
