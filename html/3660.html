(U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  SINCE THE START OF THE ZAMBIAN GMO FOOD AID </p><p>CRISIS, EMBASSY VATICAN HAS PRESSED HARD AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF </p><p>THE HOLY SEE FOR A STRONG STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF U.S. FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA AND BEYOND.  BUILDING ON OVER </p><p>A YEAR OF DIALOGUE ON THE SAFETY OF GMO\'S, THE VATICAN IS </p><p>FINALLY MOVING TOWARD ACCEPTANCE OF THE SAFETY OF GMO\'S, BUT </p><p>HAS PREFERRED TO FOCUS NARROWLY ON THE SITUATION IN ZAMBIA. </p><p>OUR MUTUAL INTEREST IN FEEDING THE WORLD\'S HUNGRY OFFERS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A MORE POSITIVE PUBLIC POSITION FROM </p><p>THE HOLY SEE ON THE SAFETY OF BIOTECH FOOD FOR HUMAN </p><p>CONSUMPTION.  WHILE SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD DOUBTLESS BE </p><p>CAREFULLY WORDED AND NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE VATICAN </p><p>CONCERNS AT ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS FROM BIOTECH CROPS, IT </p><p>COULD FACILITATE OUR BROADER EFFORT TO ERODE EUROPEAN AND </p><p>OTHER INTERNATIONAL NON-SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIONS TO BIOTECH </p><p>FOODS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACTION REQUESTED: FOLLOWING UP ON THE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>STATEMENT ON GMO FOODS AT THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT, POST </p><p>REQUESTS DEPARTMENT CONSIDER A LETTER FROM SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>TO VATICAN FM TAURAN URGING THE HOLY SEE TO ISSUE A PUBLIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04361  01 OF 03  081058Z </p><p>STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE SAFETY FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF </p><p>US FOOD ASSISTANCE, SIMILAR TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND UN </p><p>STATEMENTS IN REFS C AND F (PROPOSED TEXT AT PARA. 9 BELOW). </p><p>LETTER SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY AMBASSADOR AS SOON </p><p>AS POSSIBLE, IDEALLY BEFORE AMBASSADOR RETURNS TO THE U.S. </p><p>FOR CONSULTATIONS ON SEPTEMBER 13.  SEE PARA 9 FOR SUGGESTED </p><p>DRAFT LANGUAGE FOR THE LETTER. END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FOLLOWING REPORTS THAT CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN ZAMBIA </p><p>HAD SUPPORTED THE GOZ\'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD U.S. PROVIDED </p><p>FOOD AID (REF G), POLOFF MET AUGUST 22 WITH UNDERSECRETARY OF </p><p>THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR REFUGEES AND MIGRANT PEOPLES </p><p>FATHER MICHAEL BLUME, AND AUGUST 23 WITH JESUIT REFUGEE </p><p>SERVICE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA JENNY CAFISO TO </p><p>URGE THEM TO MAKE CLEAR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SAFETY OF U.S. </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE.  BOTH TOOK ON BOARD OUR POINTS ON FOOD AID </p><p>FROM REF H, AND REFERRED US TO THE JESUITS AT THE LUSAKA </p><p>OFFICE OF THE JESUIT REFUGEE SERVICE.  SUBSEQUENTLY, DCM AND </p><p>POLOFF MET AUGUST 29 WITH VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE.  MIGLIORE HAD NOT HEARD OF THE </p><p>ZAMBIAN IMBROGLIO, BUT PROMISED TO LOOK INTO IT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  AT A SEPTEMBER 5 FOLLOW-UP MEETING WITH VATICAN MFA </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCESCO CAVINA, POLOFF </p><p>OFFERED COPIES OF THE EC AND UN STATEMENTS SUPPORTING US FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  NOTING THAT THE USG AND HOLY SEE SHARE A STRONG </p><p>COMMON INTEREST IN HELPING TO FEED HUNGRY PEOPLE AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD, POLOFF URGED THE HOLY SEE TO ISSUE A STATEMENT SIMILAR </p><p>TO THOSE OF THE EC, UN, AND WHO.  CAVINA, WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>BRIEFED BY MIGLIORE, SAID THE VATICAN HAD DECIDED TO TAKE </p><p>ACTION TO CLARIFY THE CHURCH\'S POSITION.  THEIR PLAN OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04361  01 OF 03  081058Z </p><p>ACTION, HOWEVER, CENTERED ON A STATEMENT BY THE ZAMBIAN </p><p>BISHOPS\' COUNCIL EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO FEED THE HUNGRY NOW, </p><p>WITH THE FOOD ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE ALREADY IN ZAMBIA, WHILE </p><p>SETTING ASIDE FOR LATER ARGUMENTS ABOUT AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SUSTAINABILITY.  CAVINA ALSO SAID THE PAPAL NUNCIO IN LUSAKA </p><p>HAD CONVOKED THE JESUIT DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR </p><p>THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION (REF G) AND WOULD REMIND HIM OF THE </p><p>NEED NOT TO CONTRADICT BASIC HOLY SEE POSITIONS ON SOLIDARITY </p><p>(I.E. ON THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF USING AVAILABLE FOOD TO FEED </p><p>HUNGRY PEOPLE). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  WHILE WELCOMING THIS PROGRESS, POLOFF URGED CAVINA TO </p><p>WORK UP A BROADER MESSAGE ON THE SAFETY OF BIOTECH FOOD, </p><p>DELIVERED FROM THE HOLY SEE ITSELF.

CAVINA WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04361  02 OF 03  081059Z </p><p>NON-COMMITTAL, NOTING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD A DELICATE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT MWANAWASA, A SEVENTH DAY </p><p>ADVENTIST.  CAVINA RELATED THAT THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>JUST LAST JULY COLLUDED IN A "BAIT AND SWITCH" SETUP OF THE </p><p>PAPAL NUNCIO OVER THE ARCHBISHOP MALINGO ISSUE.

(C) FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS POST HAS WORKED TO GET TO </p><p>HOLY SEE TO BUILD ON ITS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC PUBLIC STANCE </p><p>TOWARDS BIOTECHNOLOGY. IN OUR VIEW, A STRONG PUBLIC STANCE IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY IS A NATURAL FOR ANYONE </p><p>INTERESTED IN PROMOTING FOOD SECURITY IN THE DEVELOPING </p><p>WORLD.  THE ZAMBIAN FOOD CRISIS, AS TRAGIC AS IT IS, MAY </p><p>PRESENT A "DEFINING MOMENT" FOR OUR BIOTECH DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>HOLY SEE.  NOBODY, AND ESPECIALLY NOT THE POPE, CAN ARGUE </p><p>THAT A PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SHOULD APPLY WHEN IT MEANS </p><p>REAL HUMAN BEINGS WILL GO HUNGRY OR EVEN STARVE.  WITH U.S. </p><p>FOOD AID SO VITAL TO ADDRESSING THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD </p><p>CRISIS, THE HOLY SEE SHOULD BE SINGING FROM THE SAME SHEET </p><p>WITH US.

WHILE ANY HOLY SEE STATEMENT </p><p>WOULD DOUBTLESS BE CAREFULLY WORDED AND NOT ERASE VATICAN </p><p>CONCERNS AT ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS FROM BIOTECH CROPS, IT </p><p>COULD GREATLY FACILITATE OUR BROADER EFFORT TO ERODE EUROPEAN </p><p>AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIONS TO AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS </p><p>OF BIOTECH FOODS.
