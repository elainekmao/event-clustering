<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, PINS, IV, NI, UV </p><p>SUBJECT: MGIV01: ALLEGATION OF BURKINABE INVOLVEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABIDJAN 3334 </p><p>     B. LOME 1309 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason:  1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Former Nigerian FM Kingibe alleges that the </p><p>September 19 coup plot was hatched in Ouagadougou by Guei and </p><p>Burkina\'s Interior Minister. Kingibe has good connections </p><p>across the region, but his version of events might be </p><p>influenced by his role as a political consultant to the GOCI. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Baba Gana Kingibe is a former Foreign Minister (and </p><p>Interior Minister) of Nigeria.  He makes his living today by, </p><p>among other things, political consulting.  Kingibe told DCM </p><p>October 3 that the Gbagbo government had been a client early </p><p>in its tenure. Kingibe claimed that he had helped the GOCI </p><p>warm its relations with Nigeria and convinced Pretoria to </p><p>release a shipment of ARMSCOR products ordered by Bedie that </p><p>had been frozen following Guei\'s coup.  The late Interior </p><p>Minister of Cote d\'Ivoire, Emile Boga Doudou, had been an </p><p>acquaintance whom Kingibe had met through "Francois," a </p><p>business associate and mutual friend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) At a point in the past Kingibe did not specify, Guei </p><p>reportedly met in Ouagadougou with the Burkinabe Interior </p><p>Minister (possibly a reference to Security Minister Bassole) </p><p>at the home of an exiled Guei Minister to plot Gbagbo\'s </p><p>overthrow.  However, the former Guei subordinate let it be </p><p>known that he did not want to participate in the plot.  He </p><p>was, Kingibe said, quickly "eliminated," but not before </p><p>Gbagbo got wind of the scheme against him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Consequently, Gbagbo arranged for Boga Doudou to meet </p><p>his Burkinabe counterpart in Paris to smooth things over </p><p>between the two countries.  The meeting ended, amicably Boga </p><p>Doudou thought.  He returned to Abidjan September 18 to be in </p><p>place while Gbagbo went to Rome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Kingibe said "Francois" later told him that Boga </p><p>Doudou, realizing fairly early on the 19th what had been set </p><p>in motion by the rebel forces, jumped his back wall into the </p><p>compound of a French expat to escape rebels who would soon be </p><p>at his front door. He called "Francois" from that compound </p><p>and during the conversation reportedly said, "Francois they </p><p>are coming in.  I am shot." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Kingibe opined that Campaore was probably aware of </p><p>his Interior Minister\'s (Security Minister\'s) activities. </p><p>Kingibe suggested that Campaore thought such machinations </p><p>might impress Libya. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Kingibe said he believed Liberia\'s denials of </p><p>involvement in this particular effort to destabilize Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment:  Kingibe is smooth and articulate and </p><p>capable of being manipulative.  The story he tells is not </p><p>inconsistent with what we know of pre-coup attempt events. </p><p>Kingibe could be telling the unvarnished truth as he </p><p>understands it, or he might be shading it to achieve a </p><p>desired objective.  The mention of Libya was obviously </p><p>intended to pique USG interest.  One assumes Kingibe </p><p>continues to work for Gbagbo as a political consultant </p><p>(Kingibe did not claim the contrary), and Gbagbo would </p><p>benefit from the USG believing that Campaore was behind the </p><p>rebellion.  Kingibe did not claim Campaore knew what his </p><p>Minister was doing, but he strongly suggested it by saying </p><p>that Campaore was constantly meddling in the affairs of </p><p>neighboring states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The picture Kingibe paints of Burkinabe instigation is </p><p>troublesome.  It would mean that Campaore\'s attempt at </p><p>rehabilitation by cutting his partnership with Charles Taylor </p><p>is pure subterfuge.  It also suggests that Campaore had not </p><p>tired of Taylor\'s antics but had tired instead of playing </p><p>second fiddle and was ready to embark on destabilizing </p><p>misadventures where he was the leading man. If so, this would </p><p>make him as equally dangerous to sub-regional stability as </p><p>his former friend in Monrovia. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
