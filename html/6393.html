SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MARCH 14 REMARKS ON THE ROADMAP </p><p>FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE GENERATED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN LOCAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL MEDIA.  "AL-ITTIHAD" DESCRIBED THE REMARKS AS A RENEWAL </p><p>OF HOPE FOR ENDING THE SUFFERING OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. </p><p>CONVERSELY, AN "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL BELIEVES THE REMARKS MERELY </p><p>REPRESENT A POISONED CARROT ON THE EVE OF A U.S. ATTACK AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ.  FURTHER EDITORIALS COMMENTED ON THE SITUATION FACING THE </p><p>U.S., WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY COUNTRY FOR WAR AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p>SIMILARLY, AN \'AKHBAR AL ARAB\' EDITORIAL DESCRIBED THE U.S. AS </p><p>\'ISOLATED\' IN ITS DETERMINATION FOR WAR.  ON A MUCH NEGLECTED </p><p>TOPIC, A \'GULF NEWS\' EDITORIAL CHARACTERIZES AFGHANISTAN AS \'THE </p><p>STATE FORGOTTEN.\'  FINALLY, DR. TARIQ SAYF TELLS SADDAM TO "GO TO </p><p>HELL."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE MARCH 14 REMARKS OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BLAIR ON THE ROADMAP TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE, SHARJAH- </p><p>BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE STATEMENTS OF BUSH AND BLAIR LAST NIGHT ON PALESTINE </p><p>REPRESENT ONLY A POISONED CARROT ... TO PAVE THE WAY FOR A </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE WAR AGAINST IRAQ AND THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD ... </p><p>WHOEVER WANTS TO RE-IMPOSE THE DARKNESS OF OCCUPATION WOULD </p><p>REALLY NOT ALLOW A SOLUTION TO PALESTINE SINCE IT IS THE CORE OF </p><p>CONFLICT.  THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS ONLY PART OF A WIDER PLAN THAT </p><p>AIMS TO WIPE OUT PALESTINE AND PASS IT ON TO THE ZIONISTS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  DESCRIBING THE INCREASINGLY NEGATIVE ARAB ATTITUDE TOWARDS </p><p>THE CRISIS IN IRAQ, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... ARABS SHOULD REALIZE THAT DEFENDING IRAQ IS A PART OF </p><p>DEFENDING THEMSELVES SINCE THE OCCUPATION PLANS DO NOT ONLY </p><p>TARGET BAGHDAD BUT ALL ARAB CAPITALS.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS </p><p>ANNOUNCED HONESTLY WHEN INDICATING THE NEED TO CHANGE THE MAP OF </p><p>THE WHOLE REGION ACCORDING TO THEIR BENEFITS AND THOSE OF ISRAEL. </p><p>THERE IS NO SOLUTION EXCEPT TAKING A SERIOUS ARAB STAND IN ORDER </p><p>TO STOP THE ANTICIPATED WAR, SO AMERICAN MILITARY ACTIONS WON\'T </p><p>TARGET ANOTHER VICTIM AFTER FINISHING ITS PLANS AGAINST IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>4.  NOTING A NEW HOPE FOR SOLVING THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE IN BUSH\'S </p><p>MARCH 14 REMARKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... STATEMENTS MADE BY PRESIDENT BUSH ON A PLAN TO REALIZE PEACE </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE RENEWED </p><p>HOPES TO END THE TRAGEDY OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND STOP THEIR </p><p>SUFFERING ... THE PRACTICAL AND IMPORTANT STEPS THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>TAKEN TO DECLARE A PALESTINIAN STATE LIVING SIDE BY SIDE WITH A </p><p>SECURE AND RECOGNIZED ISRAEL SHOULD START NOT WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WHO ARE, ACCORDING TO THE BUSH/BLAIR VISION, UNDER </p><p>OCCUPATION, BUT WITH AN INTERNATIONAL REQUEST FOR ISRAEL TO CARRY </p><p>OUT THE TENS OF INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE </p><p>IGNORED.  THE HOPE OF THE PALESTINIAN DREAM HAS BEEN RENEWED AND </p><p>THE ONLY THING LEFT IS TO MOBILIZE ALL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT AND </p><p>TURN SUCH A DREAM INTO A LIVING REALITY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE SITUATION FACING U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. </p><p>BUSH, "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... A NOTABLE AMERICAN DEMOCRAT, JIM MOURAN, REVEALED THE TRUTH </p><p>BY ACCUSING AMERICAN-JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS OF PUSHING WASHINGTON </p><p>TO LAUNCH A WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  HE ALSO ADDED THAT JEWISH-AMERICAN </p><p>LEADERS COULD STOP THE WAR IF THEY DESIRED!  THE LONDON \'TIMES\' </p><p>STATED YESTERDAY:  \'THE HAWKS IN THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION ARE </p><p>PRESSURING HIM INTO WALKING A PATH OF WAR WITH OR WITHOUT UN </p><p>APPROVAL.\' ... PRESIDENT BUSH SEEMS TO BE UNDER A ZIONIST SIEGE </p><p>AND IS SURRENDERING TO ALL PRESSURE THAT WILL TRAP HIM INTO AN </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>6.  DESCRIBING THE U.S. AS \'ISOLATED\' IN ITS POLICY TOWARDS IRAQ, </p><p>ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>3/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS STRANGE ABOUT THE IRAQI CRISIS IS THE TRANSFORMATION </p><p>OF THE SITUATION, SINCE AFTER TOTAL ISOLATION, BAGHDAD NOW ENJOYS </p><p>WIDE SYMPATHY FROM ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD, NOT OUT OF SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE EXISTING IRAQI REGIME, BUT OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES, ETHICS, AND CHARTERS THAT SUPPORT PEACE AND REJECT </p><p>WAR.  ON THE OTHER HAND, ALL COUNTRIES ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THE </p><p>\'DISHONESTY\' OF AN AMERICAN POSITION RUSHING TOWARDS A WAR </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ WITH NO LEGAL OR OBJECTIVE REASON ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  DESCRIBING AFGHANISTAN AS \'THE FORGOTTEN STATE\', DUBAI-BASED </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... JUST OVER A YEAR AGO, KARZAI\'S GOVERNMENT WAS PROMISED $4.5 </p><p>BILLION AT THE TOKYO DONORS CONFERENCE, BUT TO DATE ONLY $1.8 </p><p>BILLION HAS BEEN HANDED OVER.  AFGHANISTAN IS SINKING BACK INTO </p><p>THE DECENTRALIZED CHAOS UNDER WHICH REGIONAL LEADERS WILL RUN </p><p>THEIR AREAS, PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>KABUL, WHILE MOVING AHEAD ON THEIR OWN, RAISING THEIR OWN </p><p>REVENUES WHERE THEY CAN.  WITHOUT STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, </p><p>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THE CONTROL THAT </p><p>IT NEEDS.  AT THE VERY LEAST THE INTERNATIONAL DONORS SHOULD </p><p>DELIVER WHAT THEY PROMISED.  AFGHANISTAN NEEDS BETTER TREATMENT </p><p>THAN TO BE FORGOTTEN AS THE UNITED STATES MOVES ON TO ITS NEXT </p><p>TARGET." </p><p> </p><p>8.  TELLING SADDAM TO "GO TO HELL," DR. TARIQ SAYF, A UNIVERSITY </p><p>PROFESSOR, EDITORIALIZED IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON 3/9: </p><p> </p><p>"  THE ARAB FEARS OF WAR CAN BE SUMMED UP AS FOLLOWS:  THE FEAR </p><p>OF U.S. DOMINATION OVER THE REGION, FEAR OF THE U.S. SUCCESS IN </p><p>TAKING CONTROL OF THE RESOURCES OF OIL, AND THE FEAR OF THE </p><p>QUESTION OF POLITICAL CHANGE ...  AS FOR U.S. DOMINATION AND </p><p>CONTROL, I DO NOT THINK THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER, WHICH IS BASED </p><p>ON THE UNILATERAL CONTROL OF A SOLE SUPERPOWER, EXCLUDES THE GULF </p><p>REGION ... INSTEAD OF ENGAGING IN MEANINGLESS ARAB VITUPERATIONS, </p><p>WE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DOMINANT U.S. DEVIL ... </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNING OIL, DURING AND AFTER THE GULF WAR, SOME OF THE PEOPLE </p><p>... SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD INSTRUCTED SADDAM HUSSEIN TO </p><p>ENTER KUWAIT TO ENABLE IT TO TAKE CONTROL OF OIL IN THE GULF </p><p>EASILY.  THE FOLLOWING YEARS PROVED THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE ... THE </p><p>STRANGE THING IN THIS RESPECT IS THAT ARAB THINKERS FROM OUTSIDE </p><p>THE GULF ARE THE ONES WHO PAY THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO OIL, AS </p><p>IF OIL IS A PART OF ARAB FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>THE THIRD FEAR IS EXPRESSED BY POLITICAL REGIMES AND SOME OF </p><p>THEIR THINKERS ... HERE, SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE AMERICANS </p><p>HAVE A MAGIC WAND FOR DEMOCRACY.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES HAS SO FAR NOT MANAGED TO CHANGE THE POLITICAL STYLE IN </p><p>MANY COUNTRIES.  SO HOW IS IT GOING TO IMPOSE THAT ON IRAQ AND </p><p>OTHER (ARAB) COUNTRIES?  YET, EVERYBODY KNOWS FOR SURE THAT </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGE IS DEFINITELY FORTHCOMING, SINCE THERE ARE </p><p>DOMESTIC REASONS FOR IT AND IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IMPOSED ONLY </p><p>BY THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>LET US SET ASIDE THESE ARAB REASONS AND JUSTIFICATIONS AND ASK </p><p>THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:  HAS ANY SANE ARAB PERSON TRIED TO ASK </p><p>HIMSELF - OR HAS ANYBODY ASKED HIM FOR HIS OPINION - ABOUT WHAT </p><p>HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE SINCE 1958, OR </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, WHEN THE IRAQI PEOPLE REACHED THE CATASTROPHIC </p><p>STAGE OF ITS HISTORY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SADDAM HUSSEIN?  HOW </p><p>CAN A PEOPLE, WHOSE SIZE IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND THAT POSSESSES </p><p>HUGE POTENTIAL AND UNLIMITED RESOURCES, LIVE UNDER THIS MISERABLE </p><p>SITUATION? ... DID SADDAM SEEK ANYBODY\'S ADVICE ON WHAT HE DID? </p><p>THEN LET HIM GO TO HELL AND LET HIS REGIME COME TO AN END.  HE </p><p>HAS DESTROYED HIS PEOPLE\'S ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE, AND </p><p>THERE IS NO ARAB POWER THAT CAN TOPPLE HIM." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
