<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000359 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PARM, ETTC, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: MANPADS NEA BILATERAL PLANS: YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 36950 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Willeah E. Cato for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  Yemen has taken significant steps to </p><p>restrict the number of Man Portable Air Defense Systems </p><p>(MANPADS) available to civilians.  The ROYG has invested an </p><p>estimated $30 million in a weapons buy-back program designed </p><p>to remove MANPADS, RPGs, and other weapons from the civilian </p><p>arms market.  While ROYG commitment appears firm, post is </p><p>following up with Yemen\'s Defense Ministry to address key </p><p>questions -- including availability of resources to sustain </p><p>the buy-back effort.  U.S. assistance could be important in </p><p>that regard.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  The ROYG clearly shares USG concerns on the </p><p>control of MANPADS and is actively trying to remove stocks </p><p>available to the civilian population.  Particularly after the </p><p>unsuccessful September 2002 shooting attack on a Hunt Oil </p><p>helicopter and the al-Qaeda attempt to shot down an Israeli </p><p>airliner in Kenya, ROYG is sensitive to the danger of a </p><p>MANPADS attack. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  During the 1994 civil war a variety of heavy </p><p>weapons (antitank and MANPADS), especially those from the </p><p>former Soviet Union, were available to the general population </p><p>in large quantities.  With the war\'s conclusion and the </p><p>government\'s assumption of central control, many of these </p><p>weapons (estimated in the tens of thousands) remained </p><p>unaccounted for.  Countless weapons, including MANPADS, were </p><p>readily available from weapons souks and rural villages where </p><p>tribal leaders have amassed small arsenals.  These stockpiles </p><p>included Strellas and Grails from Russia and the former East </p><p>bloc. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Today, both government forces and certain </p><p>civilian (especially tribal) elements are in possession of </p><p>MANPADS.  MANPADS in military control are kept in armed </p><p>forces storage facilities under the direct supervision of a </p><p>line commander.  Yemen\'s civilian population overall is </p><p>heavily armed, and ROYG\'s reach, although strong in Sanaa, </p><p>remains limited in many rural areas.  Nevertheless increased </p><p>government regulation and the weapons buy-back program are </p><p>making a difference.  New procedures are in place for </p><p>controlling the sale of MANPADS from weapons souks under </p><p>which arms dealers/purchasers must obtain a license from the </p><p>central government in order to handle MANPADS.  The objective </p><p>of these ROYG programs is to remove MANPADS from the civilian </p><p>market wherever they are found. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  At ROYG invitation, in late January 2003 </p><p>Ambassador and DATT viewed a representative sample of 18 </p><p>months of collection efforts from five collection sites. </p><p>This sample alone included over 1000 MANPADS (Stellas and </p><p>Grails) -- clear evidence of the substantive and </p><p>unprecedented action being taken by the ROYG.  By eliminating </p><p>key weapons systems from the arms souks, ROYG reduces the </p><p>quantity available to potential terrorists. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Post is actively following implementation of the </p><p>buy-back program with the Ministry of Defense, as underscored </p><p>in our Mission Performance Plan.  Many important questions </p><p>remain to be answered regarding the program\'s overall impact. </p><p> The number of MANPADS in private hands (i.e. outside the </p><p>scope of arms bazaars) is unknown, for example, as is the </p><p>extent of ongoing movement of MANPADS into/out of Yemen. </p><p>While ROYG commitment appears firm, the effectiveness of </p><p>enforcement and availability of resources sufficient to </p><p>sustain the buy-back program can only be answered over time. </p><p>However, the buy-back program could be a good investment of </p><p>U.S. funds, both to ensure the program\'s continuation, and to </p><p>reiterate the strength of U.S.-Yemen cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
