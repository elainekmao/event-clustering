<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000808 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRASER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  BUHARI NOT READY TO CONCEDE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  In a late night meeting with Ambassador </p><p>on April 23, ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari </p><p>restated his rejection of the just completed Presidential, </p><p>Gubernatorial and National Assembly elections.  He said he </p><p>lost because the PDP stole the election.  He reiterated his </p><p>position that new elections were necessary and that no </p><p>legitimate government would exist in Nigeria after May 29. </p><p>He stressed that the only thing he wanted was "an </p><p>opportunity for Nigerians to choose their government </p><p>through free, fair and transparent elections."  Buhari </p><p>asserted that he would adhere to whatever decision the ANPP </p><p>made on contesting the election, saying that he was a </p><p>"prisoner of the party."  However, he expressed little </p><p>confidence in the efficacy of the electoral tribunals to </p><p>redress the deficiencies of the elections.  Because of the </p><p>patent electoral irregularities in many areas, Buhari has </p><p>been trying to sculpt himself into the role of "guardian of </p><p>democracy."  Given Buhari\'s coupist past, and less than </p><p>sterling reputation on human rights, this new role is laden </p><p>with irony but Buhari seems intent to play it to the hilt. </p><p>However, we do not think it will stick.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Buhari will try to galvanize the opposition and public to </p><p>reject the elections.  While his efforts will likely prove </p><p>quixotic, he remains a compelling figure who will demand </p><p>attention and probably keep tension high, at least in the </p><p>short-term.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUHARI\'S STAND </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  In a late night meeting with Ambassador Jeter on </p><p>April 23, ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari </p><p>restated his stand on the Presidential, Gubernatorial and </p><p>National Assembly elections.  He asserted that elections </p><p>did not take place in at least 13 of Nigeria\'s 36 states. </p><p>Results from these areas were tantamount to forgeries, he </p><p>continued.  Since the elections did not hold in these </p><p>areas, INEC could not have legally declared Obasanjo victor </p><p>as he would have been unable to satisfy the geographical </p><p>requirement of winning 25 percent of the vote in 25 states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Buhari attributed his defeat to alleged fraudulent </p><p>manipulation of the electoral process by the incumbent PDP </p><p>and partisan INEC commissioners.  Buhari maintained that </p><p>the PDP used various methods to skew the April 12 and the </p><p>April 19 polls, including ballot box-stuffing, intimidation </p><p>of voters, the fraudulent registration process and outright </p><p>manufacturing of election results.  The ANPP had noted </p><p>these deficiencies in its statements after the April 12 </p><p>legislative elections; however, he accused INEC of </p><p>willfully ignoring its critics and continuing with the </p><p>April l9 elections without resolving its deficiencies. </p><p>Buhari maintained his interest in coordinating with other </p><p>aggrieved parties.  According to Buhari, however, APGA </p><p>Presidential Candidate Chukwemeka Ojukwu had initially </p><p>agreed to cooperate.  Buhari said that after he talked to </p><p>APGA about coordination, Ojukwu made a statement asking for </p><p>INEC to clean up the results.  The next day, Ojukwu </p><p>declared himself the winner of the Presidential elections </p><p>so "I do not know what his plans are," said Buhari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Buhari said the elections in the Southeast and </p><p>South-South were particularly opprobrious, failing to meet </p><p>minimal standards.  He claimed that insufficient </p><p>documentary evidence existed to pursue court cases in many </p><p>states of those two regions because the ersatz results were </p><p>"cooked" at the various INEC headquarters.  No genuine </p><p>polling station or collation center tally sheets were </p><p>completed since no voting ever occurred.  He also cited </p><p>problems in Kaduna, Katsina, Nasarawa, Benue and Adamawa </p><p>states as "serious."  However, Buhari said, in these states </p><p>a semblance of elections took place even though results </p><p>were manipulated in the collation process. In these cases, </p><p>Buhari continued, the ANPP would take individual issues to </p><p>the Elections Tribunals, since documentation of the </p><p>outcomes exists.  He said that the ANPP was compiling its </p><p>evidence and would present it to the Embassy when data </p><p>collection was complete. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Accusing President Obasanjo of complicity in the </p><p>alleged fraud, Buhari stated "I do not believe that the </p><p>President did not know" about the wrongdoing.  Buhari </p><p>claimed the ANPP uncovered ballot boxes in Katsina, Niger, </p><p>Kaduna and Kano states before the Presidential elections. </p><p>He said that security officials at many sites (mostly in </p><p>the Southeast and South-South, but not limited there) fired </p><p>weapons into the air to frighten off voters so the security </p><p>personnel could swipe then stuff the ballot boxes at an </p><p>alternative location. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUHARI\'S STRATEGY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Buhari, while stopping short of declaring his </p><p>victory, said that elections were so flawed that, after the </p><p>May 29 inauguration, "no legitimate government would exist" </p><p>in Nigeria.  He has said that his followers should not </p><p>"recognize any government" after May 29 and has called for </p><p>"mass action" in support of his claims.  He has not defined </p><p>what those actions should be and told the Ambassador that </p><p>he was willing to accept the lead of the ANPP in deciding </p><p>his course of action.  The party, however, had yet to </p><p>decide on its course of action as it was still examining </p><p>all its options.  (COMMENT:  Buhari was probably attempting </p><p>to distance himself from the spectre of mass protests </p><p>getting out of hand.  Prior to this meeting, he had been on </p><p>the ramparts leading the call for mass action. However at </p><p>the meeting, he claimed that he was a "prisoner of his </p><p>party" and would simply follow what the party decided -- as </p><p>if he had no voice in this matter.  Instead of being the </p><p>General that he is, Buhari laid the claim that he merely </p><p>was a pliant foot soldier.  We found this disingenuous. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT DOES HE WANT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Buhari rejected the option of the ANPP </p><p>participating in the Obasanjo Administration, complaining </p><p>that such a government would be a sham because Obasanjo </p><p>would simply people it with opportunists from the ANPP and </p><p>other opposition parties.  Asked by the Ambassador if he </p><p>had spoken to Obasanjo, Buhari said that Obasanjo had </p><p>requested a meeting but he had refused.  Buhari stated that </p><p>he was not interested in speaking with Obasanjo, as he </p><p>really had no hope of finding common ground with the </p><p>President so there was no reason to go through the </p><p>pretense.  Ambassador told Buhari that the importance of </p><p>these elections extended beyond Nigeria\'s borders; the </p><p>elections had implications for peace, stability and the </p><p>rule of law in the region and throughout Africa.  Buhari </p><p>responded that he was aware of Nigeria\'s importance </p><p>throughout the continent, and stressed that the only thing </p><p>he wanted was "an opportunity for Nigerians to choose their </p><p>government through free, fair and transparent elections." </p><p>Buhari said that he felt trapped by the party, but stated </p><p>flatly that he "could not step down."  "If I were to do </p><p>something other than what my party is telling me, I would </p><p>lose all political credibility," Buhari stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  Buhari will continue his clamor for </p><p>repeating the election.  He knows this is highly </p><p>improbable, but it maintains his stature as Obasanjo\'s </p><p>staunchest national critic and, implicitly, as the champion </p><p>of Northern interests.  Buhari\'s challenge is whether he </p><p>can unite the opposition parties in a post-election </p><p>campaign to challenge the results.  His martinet </p><p>antecedents and his perceived regional chauvinism will </p><p>crimp this attempt.  Consequently, Buhari will continue to </p><p>make waves and good newsprint; however, unless he can </p><p>galvanize the opposition, especially the APGA and the AD, </p><p>the waves he makes alone and with fellow Northerners </p><p>probably will be insufficient to up-end the election </p><p>results. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
