<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KABUL 001744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ZKHALILZAD, DSEDNEY, RHANSON </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, MARR, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: NATO ISAF DELEGATION DISCUSSES SECURITY, AIRPORT </p><p>OPERATIONS, RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Robert P. Finn for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Post hosted June 19 a meeting with the visiting NATO </p><p>International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) delegation led </p><p>by Deputy Secretary General for Peacekeeping Robert Serry. </p><p>Representatives from NATO embassies in Kabul included the UK, </p><p>Spanish, Turks, Danes, and Dutch; the Germans, Belgians and </p><p>French also have embassies in Kabul but did not attend the </p><p>meeting.  Discussion focused on security in and around Kabul, </p><p>necessary preparations for NATO,s assumption of ISAF </p><p>command, lead nation responsibility for Kabul International </p><p>Airport, and potential Russian assistance to ISAF.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SECURITY AND SUGGESTIONS FOR NATO ISAF </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The delegation expressed pleasant surprise regarding </p><p>the efficiency of the Afghan MFA and Embassy in Brussels, </p><p>which transmitted a NATO paper to Kabul, circulated it </p><p>amongst other Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan </p><p>(TISA) ministries, collected comments, and generated </p><p>constructive feedback. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Deputy Secretary General Serry and his staff inquired </p><p>about security in Kabul and throughout the country, </p><p>developments surrounding the October Constitutional Loya </p><p>Jirga (CLJ), the summer 2004 elections, and security sector </p><p>reforms including disarmament, demobilization, and </p><p>reintegration (DDR) and restructuring the Ministry of </p><p>Defense.  The discussion touched only briefly on Provincial </p><p>Reconstruction Teams (PRT), as the delegation intended to </p><p>address the issue separately in a subsequent meeting with </p><p>Office of Military Cooperation Chief MG Karl Eikenberry. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Offering the Embassy Kabul perspective on important </p><p>steps in NATO,s assumption of ISAF command, CDA and Poloffs </p><p>stressed the need to immediately establish contact with key </p><p>TISA ministries, especially the Ministry of Interior, UNAMA, </p><p>and counterparts in CJTF-180.  Embassy officers underscored </p><p>the need to start planning for security in the Kabul area of </p><p>responsibility in advance of the selection of CLJ delegates </p><p>and the actual convening of the CLJ in October.  Another </p><p>significant point is the imperative of establishing a robust </p><p>public relations/psychological operations program that </p><p>targets Kabul,s population.  Emboffs suggested that it was </p><p>not too late to start planning with relevant TISA officials </p><p>for the Hajj; such planning should start at least three </p><p>months beforehand, i.e. in September.  ISAF,s major role is </p><p>cooperation at the Kabul airport, which funneled almost half </p><p>of last year,s 26,000 Hajjis, with particular focus on </p><p>security around the airport and passenger assembly point in </p><p>liaison with the Ministry of Interior. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CDA and Poloffs also emphasized that NATO should </p><p>consider the role of ISAF in the DDR process when it arrives </p><p>in Kabul.  Furthermore, ISAF,s part in demilitarizing Kabul </p><p>(i.e. removing Afghan Militia Forces in the capital, most of </p><p>whom are Panjshiris loyal to Defense Minister Fahim) in </p><p>accordance with the Bonn Agreement should be carefully </p><p>thought out and strategized as TISA authorities and the </p><p>international community muster the political will and a </p><p>practical plan to carry out demilitarization. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>LEAD NATION FOR KABUL AIRPORT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Responding to a query on a lead nation for Kabul,s </p><p>international airport, Serry stated that the Germans were </p><p>ready to continue as lead nation provided there was common </p><p>funding.  (Comment:  Since taking over the APOD (aerial point </p><p>of departure - the military side of the combined </p><p>civilian/military Kabul International Airport) from the </p><p>Turks, the Germans have done a superb job; they have invested </p><p>much in repairing bombed out buildings, paving a new heliport </p><p>area, expanding the apron, marshalling more fire and safety </p><p>equipment, and installing many new prefabs for offices, </p><p>barracks, and storehouses.  Embassy recommends the Germans, </p><p>with whom the Embassy has an excellent working relationship, </p><p>remain in charge of the airport.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE OFFER TO NATO ISAF </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the question of Russian interest in assisting NATO </p><p>ISAF, Serry conveyed that the Alliance,s Military Committee </p><p>was studying the Russian offer, though NATO members were </p><p>divided in opinion.  Serry explained that Russian transit and </p><p>overflight permissions would be useful, but that no Russian </p><p>soldiers would be stationed with ISAF.  Intelligence sharing </p><p>via Tajikistan and possible Russian military airlift are also </p><p>part of the offer, Serry said.  He also mentioned that </p><p>Secretary General Lord Robertson had phoned Karzai about the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Russian offer of assistance and Karzai stated it was a very </p><p>sensitive subject that would have to be considered carefully. </p><p> (Comment:  Karzai, perhaps, in his first phone call with </p><p>Robertson, was too polite to tell him outright, NOT a good </p><p>idea.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Embassy officers held that Russian involvement in ISAF </p><p>is politically infeasible at this time for the Karzai </p><p>administration.  With memories still fresh of the calamity </p><p>inflicted on Afghanistan by the Soviets, most Afghans would </p><p>not understand observable Russian participation in ISAF. </p><p>Were they to become visibly involved, ISAF might face an </p><p>additional security threat with irate Afghans targeting ISAF </p><p>because of the Russian (Soviet) connection.  Also, the </p><p>Taliban, al-Qa\'ida, and Hezb-e Islami (Hekmatyar) would try </p><p>to score public relations points against the Karzai </p><p>government and Coalition for including the Russians. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Deputy Secretary General Serry informed the group that </p><p>President Karzai invited SG Robertson to Kabul on September </p><p>26, if Karzai himself is not attending the UN General </p><p>Assembly at that time.  He also conveyed that NATO invited </p><p>Foreign Minister Abdullah and SRSG Brahimi to North Atlantic </p><p>Council meetings on July 16 and 23, respectively.  Finally, </p><p>Serry offered that SG Robertson would not come to the August </p><p>12 ISAF change of command ceremony, which NATO wants to keep </p><p>low-key. </p><p>10. (U) Dushanbe minimize considered. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
