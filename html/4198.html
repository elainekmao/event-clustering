<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, NI, NI, KISL </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: GOMBE STATE BIOGRAPHIC REPORTING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Governor Alhaji Abubakar Habu </p><p>Hashidu is a key power broker in Northeast Nigeria. </p><p>Deputy Governor Joshua M. Lidani is an intelligent </p><p>technocrat; a Christian who balances Gombe State\'s </p><p>Muslim-dominated government.  The Emir of Gombe Alhaji </p><p>Shehu Usman Abubakar remains an important and </p><p>influential Northeast Nigerian Islamic leader. END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) Gombe State Governor Alhaji Abubakar Habu </p><p>Hashidu is a popular political figure who has managed </p><p>to maintain good ties with both the Northern power </p><p>elite and the Obasanjo Administration. He is one of a </p><p>number of northern career civil servants who joined </p><p>politics after retirement.  An US-educated </p><p>agricultural specialist, Hashidu won the gubernatorial </p><p>seat in 1999 under the All Peoples\' Party (APP) </p><p>ticket, beating his friend and colleague, Peoples </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Ambassador Yerima </p><p>Abdullahi.  Because of the influence of former Head of </p><p>State Babangida and others in the Northern political </p><p>elite, the Governor and several other APP governors </p><p>then quietly swung their states\' support behind </p><p>President Obasanjo in the 1999 presidential election. </p><p>Hashidu was a member of the Vision 2010 Committee </p><p>during the Sani Abacha regime (1993-1998) and served </p><p>as Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Grain </p><p>Distribution.  The Governor was Secretary for the </p><p>Movement for the Creation of Gombe State, which was </p><p>carved out of Bauchi State in 1996, and served as Minister of </p><p>Agriculture and Water Resources under the Babangida </p><p>regime (1988-1993).  He earlier served as Permanent </p><p>Secretary and Commissioner in Bauchi State.  The </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Governor also served as Chief Agricultural Officer, </p><p>Assistant General Manager and later General Manager, </p><p>Upper Benue River Basin from 1977 to 1980.  He worked </p><p>at Kainji Dam and Biu in Borno State as an </p><p>Agricultural Officer in the 1970s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hashidu attended a three-month advanced </p><p>management course at the University of Pittsburgh in </p><p>1975.  Hashidu received his BS in Agricultural Science </p><p>from Missouri\'s Lincoln University (1965-69) and </p><p>attended summer courses at Utah State University </p><p>(1967) and the University of New Hampshire (1966). </p><p>The Governor studied at Nigeria\'s Ahmadu Bello </p><p>University (1964) in Zaria.  Born in 1944 in Dukku, </p><p>the Governor holds the traditional title of Muttawali </p><p>of Dukku.  Hashidu, a Muslim and ethnic Fulani, is </p><p>married to Aishatu Abubakar.  The Governor has three </p><p>sons and three daughters.  He speaks excellent </p><p>English, Hausa, and Fulani.  (COMMENT: The politically </p><p>savvy and sophisticated Hashidu is an earnest and </p><p>engaging interlocutor. The Governor is frank and well </p><p>spoken.  During 3-plus years in office, Hashidu has </p><p>given Gombe\'s citizens improved drinking water and </p><p>security for rural residents, particularly the farmers </p><p>who were for years subjected to the armed cattle </p><p>raiders and banditry emanating from marauding gangs. </p><p>Hashidu, an excellent political strategist, has </p><p>stunted PDP (Nigeria\'s ruling party, dominant among </p><p>Gombe\'s elite) aspirations to unseat him in elections </p><p>slated for 2003, by sticking to populist grassroots </p><p>projects, such as improving infrastructure and rural </p><p>security. The Governor is a good friend and supporter </p><p>of Babaginda.  He is also well disposed to the United </p><p>States.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Deputy Governor Joshua M. Lidani, an </p><p>intelligent and successful lawyer, likely keeps his </p><p>post because Governor Hashidu needs a Christian to </p><p>politically balance his Muslim-dominated state </p><p>government.  However, a Christian is much less of a </p><p>potential rival to Hashidu. (COMMENT:  During a 75- </p><p>minute meeting with the Ambassador and the Governor in </p><p>early October 2002, Lidani said nothing, but appeared </p><p>to have the Governor\'s confidence.  Embassy sources </p><p>report that Lidani is not a power broker in the Gombe </p><p>State Government, but is an influential leader in the </p><p>minority Christian community (30% of Gombe State); he </p><p>has also donated money for new church construction and </p><p>Christian schools for the handicapped.  In private </p><p>discussions with Econoff, Lidani was professional and </p><p>friendly.  Born in Kaltungo, Lidani is married and </p><p>speaks excellent English and several African </p><p>languages. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) His Highness the Emir of Gombe Alhaji Shehu </p><p>Usman Abubakar is one of the most influential Muslim </p><p>leaders in Northeast Nigeria.  The Emir, who assumed </p><p>the throne in 1986, is Chairman of Gombe State Council </p><p>of Chiefs.  The Emir supported Governor Hashidu\'s </p><p>(1999-present) chief opponent in 1999, the PDP </p><p>candidate and present Nigerian Ambassador to Malaysia </p><p>Yerima Abdullahi, who is married to one of the Emir\'s </p><p>daughters.  Before his appointment as Emir, Abubakar </p><p>was a career civil servant in former Bauchi State. </p><p>The Emir speaks English well, Hausa and Fulani.  He </p><p>has four wives and many children.  (COMMENT: Abubakar </p><p>is an open and engaging man. He is not a stickler for </p><p>protocol and welcomes visits by US officials.  During </p><p>a meeting with Ambassador Jeter, the Emir spoke fondly </p><p>of a visit by former President Bush\'s son Neil to the </p><p>Emir\'s palace several years ago.  His Highness is a </p><p>horse aficionado, with a stable of over sixty, mainly </p><p>South American, horses.  END COMMENT) </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
