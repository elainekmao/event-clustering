<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER CRITICIZES U.S. POLICY ON </p><p>AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the title "DRC has chance to develop" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" </p><p>      dedicated its September 29 editorial to accusing the </p><p>      United States of triggering "the continuing strife in </p><p>      most parts of Africa," adding that the West has </p><p>      everything to benefit from an unstable Africa.  "In a </p><p>      bid to loot natural resources from Africa as well as </p><p>      support its arms industry, the U.S. Government will </p><p>      use one hand to supply weapons to armed bandits while </p><p>      raising the other hand in the name of promoting peace </p><p>      and democracy," the editorial claims.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Through the legacy of the Cold War (1950 to </p><p>      1989), the U.S. bears responsibility for the </p><p>      continuing strife in most parts of Africa.  During the </p><p>      Cold War, the U.S. delivered weapons worth US$2 </p><p>      billion to the continent.  While the U.S. ranks number </p><p>      one in global exports of arms of war, it comes last </p><p>      among industrialized nations providing non-military </p><p>      foreign aid to developing nations.  Curiously, in 1997 </p><p>      - when the DRC conflict intensified - the U.S. </p><p>      Government devoted only 0.09 percent of gross national </p><p>      product to international development assistance, the </p><p>      lowest proportion of all developed countries.  Pan- </p><p>      Africanists were hardly shocked when the Clinton </p><p>      administration employed divide and rule tactics by </p><p>      sidelining governments led by independence war heroes </p><p>      while striking up warm friendships with warlords in </p><p>      Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, branding them `the new, </p><p>      progressive leaders of Africa.\'  But these same </p><p>      regimes sponsored and armed the rampaging bandits who </p><p>      invaded the DRC, slaughtered innocent civilians and </p><p>      pillaged diamonds. </p><p> </p><p>      "So, in a bid to loot natural resources from </p><p>      Africa as well as support its arms industry, the </p><p>      U.S. Government will use one hand to supply </p><p>      weapons to armed bandits while raising the other </p><p>      hand in the name of promoting peace and </p><p>      democracy.  Those who underestimate the </p><p>      dangerous nature of Western capitalism need only </p><p>      look at the ongoing warmongering against Iraq to </p><p>      understand the crude forces that govern </p><p>      international relations.  President George W. </p><p>      Bush is waging war on the people of Iraq so that </p><p>      he can topple President Saddam Hussein, install </p><p>      a puppet in Baghdad and secure a cheap source of </p><p>      petroleum for the U.S.  As Africans, we must ask </p><p>      ourselves why the Western powers assassinated </p><p>      the DRC\'s first and only democratically elected </p><p>      Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba.  Africans must </p><p>      resist manipulation and stand up for their </p><p>      rights. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
