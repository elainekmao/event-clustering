<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003172 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR L/UNA, EB/ESC, IO/UNP, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IZ, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT OFFICIALS ON IRAQ SANCTIONS IMPLEMENTATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 123640 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Economic Counselor Robert Silverman </p><p>for reasons 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Emboffs met with MFA and Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat officials to obtain information on Turkish </p><p>implementation of Iraq sanctions as requested reftel. </p><p>Although our interlocutors cautioned that they could not </p><p>provide definitive answers on how quickly Turkish sanctions </p><p>against Iraq would be lifted once a new UN Security Council </p><p>resolution is passed, they opined that new legislation would </p><p>not be required and that the process would take place quickly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Tevfik Mengu, Director General for Agreements at the </p><p>Foreign Trade Undersecretariat, told Econoff that MFA rather </p><p>than U/S Foreign Trade had the lead on this issue.  However, </p><p>he opined that new legislation would not be necessary to </p><p>implement the resolution.  Mengu suggested that a customs </p><p>circular or publication of the resolution in the State </p><p>Gazette would be sufficient, and that the change could be </p><p>implemented within 24 hours of a UNSC vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Akif Ayhan, Head of Department at MFA\'s Bilateral </p><p>Economic Affairs Department, also suggested that new </p><p>legislation would not be needed to lift sanctions, and that </p><p>the change could be effected within days of a UNSC </p><p>resolution.  He noted that, while MFA would inform all </p><p>relevant Turkish agencies of the final resolution, Foreign </p><p>Trade would be responsible for implementing any change in </p><p>sanctions policy.  Serra Erarslan, MFA Iraq office director, </p><p>told Poloff on May 12 that she would check on whether </p><p>legislation would be required to bring the resolution into </p><p>force and provide further information to the Embassy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
