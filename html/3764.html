<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 002321 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL CONTINUES, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACTIVISTS UNDER PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KINSHASA 793 B. KINSHASA 876 C. KINSHASA 1520 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL OFFICER PEGGY BLACKFORD FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) SUMMARY: THE TRIAL OF THOSE ACCUSED OF KILLING </p><p>LAURENT KABILA REOPENED TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT FANFARE AT THE </p><p>END OF AUGUST.  CLOSING ARGUMENTS ARE EXPECTED SOON.  CLEAR </p><p>BIAS, A MULTIPLICITY OF PROCEDURAL ERRORS AND LACK OF </p><p>EVIDENCE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE VERDICT WHICH MAY </p><p>HAVE BEEN DECIDED LONG AGO  IN ADDITION, THE DRC CONTINUES TO </p><p>HOLD HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST N\'SII LUANDA WITHOUT FORMAL CHARGE </p><p>AND TO ARREST MANY WITH TIES TO FORMER PRESIDENT MOBUTU\'S </p><p>ARMED FORCES ON SUSPICION OF CONCEALING ARMS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>THE KABILA TRIAL </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE SUSPECTS IN THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT KABILA, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO </p><p>THE PUBLIC MAY 2 ON THE GROUNDS OF NATIONAL SECURITY, </p><p>REOPENED AUGUST 27 ACCORDING TO OBSERVERS FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP.  POLOFF WAS ADMITTED TO </p><p>THE HEARING ROOM ON SEPTEMBER 17; HOWEVER, THE COURT RECESSED </p><p>IMMEDIATELY DUE TO THE ILLNESS OF ONE OF THE JUDGES.  DOZENS </p><p>OF ATTORNEYS WHO HAD MADE A POINTLESS TRIP TO MAKALA PRISON </p><p>WERE HEARD TO BE MUTTERING IN ANNOYANCE.  PROCEEDINGS ARE NOW </p><p>SCHEDULED TO RESUME SEPTEMBER 24 AT WHICH POINT CLOSING </p><p>ARGUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN. IN SPITE OF THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>TELEVISION CAMERAS IN THE COURT, THE PRESS HAS FAILED TO </p><p>COVER THE REOPENED PROCEEDINGS.  A LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, </p><p>LA VOIX DES SANS VOIX (VSV) WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN OF THE </p><p>REOPENING. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) THE LAW GROUP OBSERVERS WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED </p><p>BY TWO ISSUES.  THE FIRST IS A LACK OF LEGAL COUNSEL FOR MANY </p><p>OF THE PRISONERS.  ALTHOUGH ALL THE PRISONERS TECHNICALLY </p><p>HAVE COUNSEL, SOME LAWYERS ARE FAILING TO SHOW UP IN COURT </p><p>EVEN WHEN THEIR CLIENTS ARE BEING QUESTIONED.  SECOND, THE </p><p>OBSERVERS NOTE THE OBVIOUS PRO-GOVERNMENT BIAS OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE MILITARY COURT, GENERAL NAWEL MUKONGO, WHO </p><p>KEEPS A TIGHT REIN ON DEFENDANTS AND THEIR LEGAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES BUT ALLOWS THE PROSECUTOR, COLONEL CHARLES </p><p>ALAMBA, TO MAKE SPEECHES AND ACCUSATIONS WITH LITTLE OR NO </p><p>FOUNDATION.  MEMBERS OF VSV ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD </p><p>OVERLOOKED PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES SUCH AS THE LOSS OF THE </p><p>WEAPON USED TO KILL KABILA AND DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE </p><p>AUTOPSY AND OTHER INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS.  THIS IS NAWEL\'S </p><p>FIRST APPOINTMENT AS JUDGE.  HE WAS FORMERLY A PROSECUTOR </p><p>HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) CASES ARE PRESENTLY BEING BROUGHT AGAINST 118 </p><p>SUSPECTS.  A HANDFUL WERE NEVER CAPTURED, BUT ROUGHLY A </p><p>HUNDRED ARE BEING HELD AT PAVILION ONE IN MAKALA PRISON. </p><p>THEY ARE ONLY ALLOWED VISITS FROM THEIR ATTORNEYS AND BRIEF </p><p>CONTACT WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS WHO BRING THEM FOOD.  THE LAW </p><p>GROUP EXPECTS THAT A VERDICT MAY BE HANDED DOWN BY THE END OF </p><p>THE MONTH.  AT PRESENT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF APPEAL; </p><p>HOWEVER, THE LAW GROUP NOTES THERE WAS TALK OF INSTITUTING AN </p><p>APPEAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>DETENTION OF N\'SII LUANDA </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) AS REPORTED REFTEL C, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST N\'SII </p><p>LUANDA, HEAD OF A LOCAL NGO, THE COMMITTEE FOR THE </p><p>OBSERVATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (CODHO) WAS ARRESTED APRIL 19. </p><p>HE HAS BEEN HELD SINCE THEN ACCUSED OF TREASON AND HARBORING </p><p>CRIMINALS APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A </p><p>FORMER POLITICAL DETAINEE, MICHEL BISIMWA.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>LAW GROUP, N\'SII HAS ACCESS TO THREE LAWYERS BUT THEY HAVE </p><p>NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO ACCOMPANY HIM WHEN HE IS INTERROGATED. </p><p>HE STILL HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED.  HE IS INCARCERATED </p><p>IN PAVILION 8 OF MAKALA PRISON WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MORE OPEN TO </p><p>VISITS FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAN PAVILION ONE WHICH HOUSES </p><p>THE KABILA ASSASSINATION SUSPECTS.  NEVERTHELESS THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT HIS HEALTH.  HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, </p><p>WHICH ISSUED A STATEMENT SEPT. 11 CALLING ON PRESIDENT JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA TO RELEASE N\'SII, CLAIMED THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM </p><p>MALARIA.  LAW GROUP REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>N\'SII\'S CONDITION WAS SERIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP OVERWHELMED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.     (C) MEMBERS OF THE VOIX DES SANS VOIX INTERVIEWED BY </p><p>POLOFF SEPT.17 DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS OVERWHELMED WITH </p><p>CASES.  THEY WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH A NUMBER OF </p><p>ARRESTS MADE IN KINSHASA IN APRIL AND MAY 2001 AND AGAIN IN </p><p>JULY AND AUGUST OF THIS YEAR OF NATIVES OF THE EQUATEUR </p><p>REGION.  VSV HAS SINCE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IDENTIFYING </p><p>SEVEN PEOPLE, MEMBERS OF OR WITH TIES TO THE FAZ </p><p>(EX-PRESIDENT MOBUTU\'S ARMED FORCES), WHO ARE BEING HELD ON </p><p>SUSPICION OF CONCEALING ARMS   THE HEAD OF VSV, FLORIBERT </p><p>CHEBAYA, TOLD POLOFF OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA WHO HAS FAILED TO LIVE UP TO HIS PLEDGES UPON </p><p>COMING TO POWER.  SECURITY FORCES OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY.  HE </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL OF ALAMBA, PROSECUTOR IN THE KABILA </p><p>TRIAL, WHOM HE ACCUSED OF TAKING PRISONERS SO THAT HE CAN </p><p>CLAIM THE PROPERTY OF HIS VICTIMS.  HE HAD EVEN THREATENED TO </p><p>USE WEAPONS TO DETER NGOS FROM ORGANIZING A SIT-IN TO DEMAND </p><p>THE RELEASE OF N\'SII LUANDA AND ANOTHER ACTIVIST WILLY WENGA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) ALTHOUGH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THE DRC HAS </p><p>IMPROVED IN MANY RESPECTS OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE </p><p>JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD IT HAVE A </p><p>LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED EVEN MARGINALLY </p><p>RELIABLE OR ACCOUNTABLE.  THE KABILA TRIAL IN PARTICULAR WITH </p><p>ITS ECCENTRIC PROCEEDINGS, MULTIPLE AND EVER GROWING NUMBER </p><p>OF ACCUSED, BIASED RULINGS AND BIZARRE LAPSES LEADS ONE TO </p><p>SPECULATE THAT KAFKA MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN CONGOLESE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
