<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 007535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC/4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, BEXP, PGOV, PREL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: UPDATE ON BOYCOTT OF U.S. PRODUCTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 3648 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 7312 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 3394 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary.  Business contacts say that an abiding </p><p>affinity for U.S. consumer products, marketing strategies </p><p>that played up local connections, and a crackdown by the </p><p>government on political activities by professional </p><p>associations blunted the impact of calls for boycotting </p><p>American products following the expanded Israeli operations </p><p>in the West Bank and Gaza earlier this year.  With sales </p><p>mostly back to normal, U.S. franchisees and importers are now </p><p>preparing themselves for a new boycott cycle if there is any </p><p>U.S.-led coalition confrontation with Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  According to American franchisees and purveyors of </p><p>American products, the impact of calls earlier this year for </p><p>boycotts of U.S. products has faded.  Burger King, Pizza Hut, </p><p>and Popeye\'s franchisees, Coke and Pepsi, and supermarkets </p><p>and other stores that stock U.S. products all say that </p><p>business has returned to normal since September.  The only </p><p>pocket were business appears to continue to be affected is in </p><p>U.S. fastfood restaurants located near university campuses in </p><p>Amman and Irbid.  Some restaurants in these areas could </p><p>close, but according to our contacts poor management by one </p><p>franchisee is more responsible for lost business than the </p><p>boycott calls. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Businesspeople with whom we discussed the subject </p><p>cited four explanations for the short lifecycle of this most </p><p>recent boycott episode: </p><p> </p><p>-- Short local memories and an abiding affinity for U.S. </p><p>products and culture. </p><p> </p><p>-- Aggressive pricing and promotion strategies, particularly </p><p>on the part of the soft drink companies. </p><p> </p><p>-- A low-key public affairs campaign loosely coordinated by </p><p>the AmCham that highlighted the local origin of </p><p>franchise-related investment, local sourcing of products, </p><p>Jordanian jobs that depend on U.S. trade and investment, and </p><p>charitable and other good works engaged in by these companies. </p><p> </p><p>-- The aggressive stance the government has taken against </p><p>"anti-normalizers" associated with the professional </p><p>associations (ref b), as well as the high-profile </p><p>Jordan-First" campaign that asks Jordanians to place Jordan\'s </p><p>interests -- including economic -- ahead of non-Jordanian </p><p>interests (read Palestine and Iraq). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Several businesses dealing in American-branded </p><p>goods alleged that local competitors tried to take advantage </p><p>of the boycott calls to promote non-U.S. products.  This was </p><p>particularly the case in the soft drink market, which has </p><p>been flooded with low price, low quality Syrian products </p><p>since the entry into force of a Jordan-Syria trade agreement </p><p>in April 2002.  While Coke and Pepsi continue to push the </p><p>Jordanian government for safeguard protection under the </p><p>agreement (ref c), they have recovered some of their market </p><p>share through aggressive promotion and pricing of their </p><p>products. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Comment:  Our business contacts stressed the </p><p>cyclical nature of the boycott calls.  Boycotts come and go, </p><p>but the real difficulty is that each cycle is harder to deal </p><p>with than the last.  This, they say, is the greatest </p><p>long-term threat to franchise businesses and to the American </p><p>market presence.  The Pizza Hut franchisee, for example, told </p><p>us of his fear that a U.S.-led military operation against </p><p>Iraq would almost certainly provoke a new boycott cycle.  He </p><p>was confident that his businesses would survive, but at a </p><p>greater cost than in previous episodes. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
