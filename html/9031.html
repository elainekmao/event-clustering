A NSC declaration said Turkey\'s EU </p><p>harmonization attempt should be carried out in line with </p><p>"republican principles", and that EU should not delay </p><p>accession negotiations with Turkey.  All papers say that the </p><p>NSC\'s military wing is concerned that amendment to the Law </p><p>on Struggle Against Terrorism, and broadcast in languages </p><p>other than Turkish could boost terror. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President against unrestricted access to bases: President </p><p>Sezer has voiced objection to a government decision to give </p><p>the U.S. and its coalition partners unlimited access to </p><p>Turkish bases and harbors, and advised the cabinet to limit </p><p>the access period to one year, papers say.  Sezer approved </p><p>the classified government decision to open bases for Iraqi </p><p>humanitarian efforts after access for foreigners was limited </p><p>to one year, reports note.  Foreign Minister Gul is reported </p><p>as saying that combatant forces would not use Turkey\'s bases </p><p>for transit passage to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Susurluk suspect acquitted: Former DYP deputy Sedat Bucak, </p><p>who was charged for sheltering criminals and involvement in </p><p>underground activities was acquitted in the Susurluk case </p><p>for investigating links between the state and mafia, dailies </p><p>report.  Bucak, a southeastern tribal leader, has survived a </p><p>crash while travelling in the same car with a high level </p><p>police officer and a former right-wing terrorist near the </p><p>Aegean town of Susurluk in November 1996. </p><p>7th EU harmonization package underway: Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>said that a 7th "adjustment package" drafted by the </p><p>government for Turkey\'s EU drive would primarily regulate </p><p>relations between the military and civilians, papers say. </p><p>The new package will expand freedom of expression, bring </p><p>reforms to the judiciary, and raise the level of </p><p>accountability in the public sector, Gul noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HR commission meets Armenians: A delegation of the </p><p>parliamentary human rights commission has paid a visit to </p><p>the Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II in Istanbul on Thursday to </p><p>hear complaints and problems, papers report.  The commission </p><p>will continue meetings with other minority groups in Turkey, </p><p>reports say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Run Agra Co. to breed cattle in Turkey: Turkey\'s Yasar </p><p>Holding Group of companies has tied a preliminary deal with </p><p>the U.S. Run Agra company for breeding of beef cattle, </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports.  U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Robert </p><p>Pearson, will attend the signing ceremony in Izmir on June </p><p>30.  The U.S. government has guaranteed a $460,000 grant for </p><p>the project, Hurriyet says. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Things are getting messy" </p><p>Hasan Unal argued in Islamist-intellectual Zaman (6/27): </p><p>"Despite the media overlook, the fact of the matter is that </p><p>things in Iraq are getting messier for the US everyday. </p><p>Arabs are becoming more displeased with the occupation </p><p>itself as well as the occupation forces. . The anti-American </p><p>or anti-British incidents seem to be individual cases yet </p><p>the US should not be surprised if this kind of resistance </p><p>turns into an organized movement in the course of time. </p><p>Americans in Iraq did not take the necessary steps for </p><p>establishment of a new Iraqi administration in the post </p><p>Saddam era.  Instead their focus somehow shifted from </p><p>administrative issues to organize Kurds in the north.  The </p><p>US plan might be using the Kurds in order to block the rise </p><p>of Arab nationalism, yet it does not seem to be working </p><p>well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US in the post war era" </p><p>Fehmi Koru observed in Washington in Islamist-intellectual </p><p>Yeni Safak (6/27): "It seems the popular support that both </p><p>US and UK administrations have been enjoying before the war, </p><p>has started diminishing.   There are many confused minds in </p><p>Washington and they all seem to be in the process of </p><p>recalculation.  The US administration is not presenting a </p><p>unified picture, and Pentagon\'s power has become a </p><p>disturbing factor for the other administrative departments. </p><p>There are more comments and analysis than before about the </p><p>neo-cons being solely influential over the Bush </p><p>administration. . Turkey, on the other hand, had proven its </p><p>functioning democracy before the Iraq war.  And its </p><p>importance was once again underlined by President Bush as he </p><p>was reaffirming US support for Turkey\'s EU accession." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
