(U) Classified by Marcella M. Wahba, Ambassador, </p><p>reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) A quiet heads-up on 1/7 to UAE authorities </p><p>regarding consideration of laying on modest additional </p><p>security measures to help ensure the safety of Afghan </p><p>Hajj flights became slightly garbled within UAEG circles </p><p>and led to an alert being issued for a possible </p><p>hijacking of an Ariana in-bound flight to Sharjah.  The </p><p>misunderstanding was rapidly corrected, but the UAEG </p><p>subsequently determined nonetheless to land and search </p><p>five inbound aircraft from Afghanistan as a "test of </p><p>procedures."  Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan told visiting S/P Ambassador Haass that a </p><p>search of the planes and passengers yielded an alarming </p><p>number of knives, blades, wires and gas cylinders as </p><p>well as the discovery of suspiciously high amounts of </p><p>cash (dollars) in the possession of certain passengers. </p><p>MBZ briefed that as a result of the exercise, the UAEG </p><p>has decided that all aircraft inbound from Afghanistan </p><p>would be escorted by UAE Air Force fighter jets upon </p><p>entry into the UAE\'s airspace and any aircraft straying </p><p>outside of the flight path would be "shot down."  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A quiet word to the wise... </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  A/DCM, drawing from reftels, briefed officials </p><p>at the UAE\'s federal-level civil aviation authority (the </p><p>GCAA) 1/7 regarding consideration of laying on modest </p><p>additional security measures to help ensure the safety </p><p>of Afghan Hajj flights.  Stressing that there was no </p><p>specific threat reporting of which we were aware, A/DCM </p><p>nonetheless suggested that the GCAA might wish to </p><p>consider prudential measures (such as the "wanding" of </p><p>embarking/disembarking passengers with metal detectors) </p><p>or other reasonable steps to slightly elevate the </p><p>security provisions for these flights. </p><p> </p><p>...Generates a decision to test procedures </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  This information, when passed up the UAE chain </p><p>of command, became slightly garbled and led to an alert </p><p>being issued for a "possible hijacking" of an Ariana </p><p>flight inbound to Sharjah.  However, post was rapidly </p><p>able to re-engage with the UAEG and quickly put this </p><p>misunderstanding to rest.  The UAEG nonetheless decided </p><p>to divert and search five Afghan-based aircraft inbound </p><p>for the UAE for what a senior advisor to UAE Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff (and de facto Defense Minister) </p><p>Shaykh  Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MBZ) told us was </p><p>"an opportunity to test our procedures." </p><p> </p><p>Lots of dangerous items discovered </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) MBZ subsequently told Ambassador and visiting S/P </p><p>Director Ambassador Richard Haas 1/8 that he had decided </p><p>to land and search the Ariana aircraft "to see what kind </p><p>of threat they might pose to the UAE."  MBZ briefed that </p><p>searches of the planes and passengers yielded an </p><p>alarming number of knives, blades, wires, and even gas </p><p>cylinders which could be used as flame throwers.  The </p><p>Emiratis also found excessive amounts of U.S. dollars on </p><p>passengers, including up to $60,000 in cash on one </p><p>individual alone.  He wondered aloud as to how an </p><p>ordinary Afghan hajji could come up with so much money. </p><p>In MBZ\'s view, the lack of adequate security screening </p><p>for passengers embarking in Afghanistan meant that "the </p><p>Afghans are playing a dangerous game" which has a direct </p><p>impact on UAE national security.  As a result, MBZ </p><p>stated that the UAE has decided that every UAE-bound </p><p>civilian aircraft from Afghanistan will be escorted by </p><p>UAE Air Force fighter jets (Mirages) upon entering UAE </p><p>airspace and that "if the Afghans stray off course, they </p><p>will be shot down."  In response to a question from </p><p>Ambassador Haass, MBZ briefed that currently, as a </p><p>result of the upcoming Haj, between 6-8 flights per day </p><p>transit the UAE from Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Press reports </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) All UAE papers 1/8 reported that the authorities </p><p>had diverted five aircraft which had originated in </p><p>Afghanistan (four passenger planes and one cargo plane). </p><p>The passenger planes were all ultimately bound for </p><p>Jeddah, and were carrying pilgrims for the Haj. </p><p>According to the press, three planes were diverted to </p><p>Minhad Air Base near Dubai while a further two were </p><p>apparently searched at Sharjah.  (Note:  MBZ stated that </p><p>none of the five were permitted to land at Dubai </p><p>International.)  UAE authorities were quoted as </p><p>confirming that no hijacking took place and that the </p><p>passenger aircraft departed later in the evening of 1/7 </p><p>for Saudi Arabia.  Brigadier General Muhammad Sweidan </p><p>Al-Gamzi, Deputy Air Force commander, told the press </p><p>that the authorities had uncovered knives, blades and </p><p>flammable gas cans.  The Afghan Charge in Abu Dhabi, </p><p>Rashiduddin Muhammadi, was also quoted as affirming that </p><p>all of the passengers were safe. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  The UAE is well aware that its cooperation </p><p>in OEF and the GWOT -- and in particular the recent </p><p>(publicly acknowledged) remand to the U.S. of senior Al- </p><p>Qaida operative Al-Nashiri -- has raised the country\'s </p><p>profile as a potential target for revenge attacks by </p><p>Taliban/Al-Qaida elements.  This recognition no doubt </p><p>played a significant part in the decision to proceed </p><p>with the landing and searching of the Afghan aircraft -- </p><p>and the determination to provide fighter escorts after </p><p>so many  potentially dangerous items were found on </p><p>board. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
