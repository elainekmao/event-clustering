<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, and DRL/IRF </p><p>STATE PASS TO US CIRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Thich Huyen Quang Tarries in Hanoi </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  HANOI 0631 </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Please stay </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the pre-1975 </p><p>United Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), explained to </p><p>emboffs on April 1 that he had not yet returned to Quang </p><p>Ngai province because senior GVN officials still wished to </p><p>meet with him.  He noted that he had been "invited" to stay </p><p>for such meetings by a Ministry of Public Security official, </p><p>and that he was quite willing to do so.  Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>said that he did not know exactly who wanted to meet him but </p><p>speculated that it was Prime Minister Phan Van Khai or </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.  He believes the </p><p>meeting might take place in the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The Patriarch emphasized that GVN had not/not </p><p>required him to stay in Hanoi, as claimed by some </p><p>international followers.  He indicated that he still planned </p><p>to return to Quang Ngai "in a few days" after the </p><p>meeting(s).  He noted that he had already written to Quang </p><p>Ngai provincial authorities to inform them that he would </p><p>return to "resume the conditions of my house arrest." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Thich Huyen Quang expressed appreciation for </p><p>Ambassador\'s interest in calling on him; a tentative meeting </p><p>has been set for April 4. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Train troubles </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang\'s followers provided two </p><p>different accounts of attempts to purchase train tickets to </p><p>return to the south, apparently before the MPS "invitation" </p><p>to stay.  One stated that the party numbered ten people; it </p><p>had proven impossible to buy a block of ten tickets so that </p><p>they could travel together unless they delayed their travel </p><p>several days.  A young monk separately claimed that he had </p><p>been the one who had gone to the train station and been </p><p>refused tickets without explanation.  He speculated that </p><p>tickets were likely available, but that the GVN had ordered </p><p>the railway not to sell them to him. (Note:  This would </p><p>suggest active MPS monitoring of the comings and goings of </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang and supporters, which is not improbable. </p><p>End note) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Expressing his views </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang said that he had sent a six- </p><p>point letter drafted by Thich Tue Sy to the GVN on or about </p><p>March 26.  Thich Huyen Quang declined to describe the </p><p>content of this letter, apart from indicating that it was </p><p>critical on the Government Committee on Religious Affairs\' </p><p>handling of religion.  Later that day, a GVN official </p><p>contacted the head nun of Kim Lien Pagoda, where Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang\'s party has been staying.  The official reportedly </p><p>informed her that Thich Tue Sy should not be allowed to </p><p>remain there any longer.  The monk apparently departed Hanoi </p><p>that night.  The Patriarch initially indicated that Thich </p><p>Tue Sy had left because the GVN had found three of the </p><p>letter\'s six points objectionable, but another follower </p><p>separately noted that Thich Tue Sy had left primarily </p><p>because he does not have a identification card or a </p><p>residence registration and is therefore unable to stay </p><p>anywhere other than his legal place of residence more than </p><p>ten days.  The Patriarch said that he had subsequently sent </p><p>a second letter to the GVN withdrawing the three most </p><p>controversial points of the first letter. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Paying the bills </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Thich Huyen Quang said that his followers had </p><p>initially paid his hospital bills.  Subsequently, the GVN </p><p>had insisted on picking up the tab, and the hospital then </p><p>reimbursed the followers for these expenses, which ran only </p><p>about 1.5 million dong (USD 100). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Reports that Thich Huyen Quang is being kept in </p><p>Hanoi against his will appear to be wholly incorrect.  His </p><p>followers here, as well as at the International Buddhist </p><p>Information Bureau in Paris, seem to have their factional </p><p>differences and appear to generate these contradictory and </p><p>sometimes factually false accounts, likely for their own </p><p>anti-SRV or personal agendas.  A meeting between the UBCV </p><p>Patriarch and Prime Minister Khai or Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Dung would be unprecedented, as apparently was the call on </p><p>him by Vietnam Fatherland Front Head Pham The Duyet.  Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang does not/not appear to be under any imminent </p><p>threat from the GVN and there has been no obvious effort by </p><p>the GVN to limit access to the Patriarch while he has been </p><p>in Hanoi.  It is not clear what may have led to this </p><p>possible change of heart by the CPV and GVN, but repeated </p><p>expressions of concern by the USG and international </p><p>observers, as well as decades of bad publicity generated by </p><p>the IBIB and others, may have begun to wear away at the </p><p>stone and convinced them that a little respect to an elderly </p><p>bonze would not actually be fatal to the SRV or endanger </p><p>"national solidarity." </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
