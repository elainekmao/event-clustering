END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FIDEL CELEBRATES AMID CHILDREN </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE MAIN PUBLIC CELEBRATION WAS HELD IN THE </p><p>NEWLY-RESTORED PALACE OF THE JOSE MARTI PIONEERS, THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT MASS ORGANIZATI0N FOR CHILDREN UNDER </p><p>FIFTEEN.  THE PALACE IS LOCATED IN A PARK OUTSIDE </p><p>HAVANA, WHICH MEANT MANY HAVANA RESIDENTS WERE UNABLE T0 </p><p>ATTEND DUE TO LACK OF TRANSP0RTATION.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT PROVIDED DOZENS 0F BUSES T0 TRANSP0RT </p><p>CHILDREN TO THE FACILITY (F0R TWENTY CENTAVOS) FR0M ALL </p><p>HAVANAS MUNICIPALITIES.  P0L/EC0N 0FFICERS WH0 ATTENDED </p><p>THE CELEBRATION FOUND A CROWD 0F SEVERAL THOUSAND </p><p>CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF CHILDREN ACCOMPANIED BY A PARENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) WITH CAMERAS EVERYWHERE, FIDEL TOURED THE PALACE </p><p>FLANKED BY CHILDREN, LISTENING T0 ADULT INSTRUCTORS </p><p>EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS FACILITIES:  A MUSEUM, GAME R00M, </p><p>COMPUTER ROOM, ELECTRICAL ASSEMBLY ROOM, EVEN A SMALL </p><p>BAKERY AND LOW-ALCOHOL BEER BREWERY.  B0TH FIDEL AND A </p><p>YOUNG PIONEER PAID TRIBUTE T0 THE EFF0RT 0F </p><p>RECENTLY-DECEASED GENERAL SENEN CASAS REGUEIR0 IN THE </p><p>PALACES RESTORATION.  FIDEL SPENT ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE </p><p>MINUTES IN AN OPEN-AIR C0URTYARD IN THE PALACE WHERE </p><p>YOUNG PIONEERS MADE A PRESENTATI0N AND SANG "HAPPY </p><p>BIRTHDAY," AFTER WHICH CASTR0 BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE PIONEERS PRESENTED CASTRO A STAR-SHAPED </p><p>CAKE;  HE MANAGED TO BL0W 0UT M0ST BUT N0T ALL THE </p><p>CANDLES WITH ONE BREATH.  A NUMBER 0F OFFICIALS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED CASTRO, INCLUDING BROTHER HAUL (IN CIVILIAN </p><p>DRESS), VICE PRESIDENT CARL0S LACE, HAVANA CITY </p><p>HISTORIAN EUSEBI0 LEAL, FEDERATION 0F CUBAN WOMEN </p><p>PRESIDENT VILMA ESPIN, HAVANA CITY C0MMUNIST PARTY CHIEF </p><p>ESTEBAN LAZO, COMMUNIST Y0UTH UNI0N (UJC) FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY VICTORIA VELAZQUEZ AND MINISTER OF SCIENCE, </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT ROSA ELENA SIMEON.  FORMER </p><p>OLYMPIC BOXING GOLD MEDALIST TE0FILO STEVENSON CARRIED </p><p>HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER IN TO HEAR FIDEL SPEAK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) AFTERWARD, FIDEL GAVE AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW TO </p><p>SEVERAL CUBAN FEMALE JOURNALISTS WHO L0BBED QUESTIONS </p><p>THAT FURNISHED CASTRO AN 0PP0RTUNITY T0 REFLECT 0N HIS </p><p>HUMBLE YOUTH, HIS DAILY R0UTINES AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF </p><p>THE CUBAN REVOLUTION.  IN RESPONSE TO AN EXCLAMATION </p><p>THAT HE MUST BE DROWNING IN WORK, CASTRO REPLIED THAT </p><p>"NOW I DO NOT HAVE S0 MUCH WORK," REFERRING TO THE </p><p>WELL-PREPARED CADRES AND GREATER INSTITUTIONALIZATION </p><p>OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTR0LLED MEDIA HAD BEGUN T0 </p><p>FOCUS 0N THE EVENT SEVERAL DAYS BEFOREHAND.  NEWSPAPERS </p><p>RAN ARTICLES ON EVERY IMAGINABLE ASPECT OF FIDEL\'S </p><p>LIFE:  HIS YOUTH, HIS B0YH00D H0ME, HIS UNIVERSITY DAYS, </p><p>THE SIERRA MAESTRA, THE REV0LUTI0NS EARLY DAYS.  THE </p><p>FRONT PAGE OF THE AUGUST 13 EDITI0N 0F THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY NEWSPAPER "GRANMA" CARRIED A P0EM IN HON0R 0F </p><p>FIDELS BIRTHDAY CALLED "TIME D0ES N0T DEVOUR REDEEMERS" </p><p>BY JESUS ORTA RUIZ, THE REGIME\'S CURRENT POET LAUREATE. </p><p>THE AUGUST 13 EVENING NEWS SPENT OVER HALF THE BROADCAST </p><p>ON THE CELEBRATION.  THE NEWS HAS F0LL0WED BY EXTENDED </p><p>EXCERPTS FROM FIDEL\'S POST-BIRTHDAY PRESS CONFERENCE AND </p><p>A DOCUMENTARY ON FIDEL\'S LIFE CALLED "ANGEL\'S SON" </p><p>(REFERRING TO FIDEL\'S FATHER\'S FIRST NAME).  THE NEXT </p><p>DAY, "GRANMA\'S" FRONT PAGE FEATURED A LARGE PH0T0 OF </p><p>FIDEL BLOWING OUT THE CANDLES 0N HIS CAKE; INSIDE HAS </p><p>ANOTHER PHOTO SPREAD OF THE CELEBRATI0N. </p><p> </p><p>CULT OF PERSONALITY? WHAT CULT OF PERSONALITY? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) DESPITE THE MEDIA ATTENTION, THE OFFICIAL LINE </p><p>FOCUSED ON A DISINGENOUSLY-MODEST FIDEL FROWNING ON </p><p>ANYTHING THAT SMACKED OF A CULT OF PERSONALITY, BUT </p><p>SIMPLY UNABLE TO RESTRAIN AN ADORING PUBLIC.  IN A JULY </p><p>20 SPEECH TO THE PIONEERS, CASTRO MUSED ABOUT HIS </p><p>UPCOMING BIRTHDAY:  "REALLY WE HAVE NEVER CELEBRATED </p><p>BIRTHDAYS, THEY HAVE ALWAYS PASSED DISCREETLY, NOT EVEN </p><p>MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS.  ONLY RECENTLY SOME HAVE </p><p>TAKEN THE LIBERTY...OF REMEMBERING SOME OF OUR </p><p>BIRTHDAYS;  BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS RESISTED EVERYTHING THAT </p><p>COULD BE AN OFFICIAL CELEBRATION;  NOR WILL THERE BE ONE </p><p>THIS TIME."  BUT THE CELEBRATION HAD ALREADY BEEN </p><p>SCHEDULED, RIGHT DOWN TO LOCATION AND TIME:  THE JUNE 23 </p><p>EDITION OF THE COMMUNIST YOUTH UNION (UJC) NEWSPAPER </p><p>"JUVENTUD REBELDE" ANNOUNCED A "TRIBUTE TO THE COMMANDER </p><p>IN CHIEF FOR HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY" AT 10:00 AM IN THE </p><p>PIONEER PALACE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA DUTIFULLY PLAYED </p><p>ITS ASSIGNED ROLE.  THE AUGUST 11 EDITION OF "JUVENTUD </p><p>REBELDE" DECLARED ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY "TODAY WE WANT </p><p>TO TAKE LICENSE...WE KNOW THAT FIDEL WOULD PREFER </p><p>ANONYMITY, BUT IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR...TO DEPRIVE </p><p>OURSELVES OF THE JOY OF CELEBRATING HIS SEVENTIETH </p><p>BIRTHDAY."  EVEN AS THE HOOPLA REACHED A MIND-NUMBING </p><p>CRESCENDO, FIDEL INSISTED TO A REPORTER ON AUGUST 12: </p><p>"MY BIRTHDAY HAS NO IMPORTANCE...SOMETIMES, THINGS ARE </p><p>BEYOND OUR CONTROL BECAUSE WE CANNOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM </p><p>DOING CERTAIN THINGS.  I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>IT...THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID IT.  NEWSPAPERS HAVE </p><p>PUBLISHED A FEW THINGS ON THEIR OWN."  INTERVIEWED AFTER </p><p>THE PALACE CELEBRATION, FIDEL REMINDED REPORTERS HE </p><p>"FOUGHT" AGAINST A CULT OF PERSONALITY, GOING SO FAR AS </p><p>TO PROHIBIT OFFICIAL PORTRAITS OF ANY GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>A FOCUS ON FIDEL\'S AGE, PHYSICAL SAFETY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) THERE WAS PALPABLE OFFICIAL NERVOUSNESS OVER </p><p>FIDELS AGE.  ORTA RUIZS AUGUST 13 FRONT-PAGE PAEAN </p><p>PROCLAIMED CASTROS ENEMIES "WANT TIME TO CONDEMN YOU TO </p><p>DEATH...THEY COUNT YOUR HOURS, IT ENCOURAGES THEM TO SEE </p><p>YOUR WHITE BEARD...YOUR GRAY HAIR DELIGHTS THEM."  IN AN </p><p>AUGUST 12 INTERVIEW, CASTRO ANSWERED A NUMBER OF </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH, INCLUDING HIS DIET, WEIGHT </p><p>AND EXERCISE.  FIDEL ASSURED THE REPORTER HE WAS IN GOOD </p><p>HEALTH, ADDING "I DO NOT KNOW WHY PEOPLE PAY SO MUCH </p><p>ATTENTION TO OUR HEALTH.  THIS REVOLUTION HAS BEEN MADE." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) IN ADDITION TO AGE, PART OF THE BIRTHDAY HYPE </p><p>FOCUSED ON CASTROS PHYSICAL SAFETY.  THE AUGUST 11 </p><p>EDITION OF "JUVENTUD REBELDE" CARRIED A FULL-PAGE </p><p>ARTICLE FEATURING INTERVIEWS WITH THREE 0F CASTR0S </p><p>PERSONAL MINISTRY OF INTERI0R B0DYGUARDS.  FOLL0WING THE </p><p>AUGUST 13 EVENING NEWS, A BRIEF DOCUMENTARY ENTITLED </p><p>"BRAVE AND LOYAL" RECALLED FIDELS BODYGUARDS 0VER THE </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT:  DESPITE THE OFFICIALLY-FESTIVE AIR, </p><p>THE UNDERLYING MOOD HAS WISTFUL, LOOKING BACK T0 PAST </p><p>EVENTS, NOT TO THE FUTURE.  N0TWITHSTANDING OFFICIAL </p><p>DENIALS OF A CULT OF PERS0NALITY, THE C0NTINUING </p><p>OBSESSI0N WITH THE PERSON 0F FIDEL CASTR0 STRONGLY </p><p>SUGGESTS THE DEGREE TO WHICH REGIME SUPPORTERS BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE FATE OF FIDEL AND THE REV0LUTI0N ARE </p><p>INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED.  THE CELEBRATI0N 0F HIS </p><p>SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN MAY ALS0 HAVE </p><p>BEEN INTENDED TO SHOW HOW THE REV0LUTIONARY TORCH HAS </p><p>BEEN PASSED AND ACCEPTED BY Y0UNGER GENERATIONS.  THE </p><p>1994 RAFTER CRISIS WOUNDED THE REVOLUTIONS IMAGE BY </p><p>SHOWING THE DISAFFECTION OF THE TWENTYSOMETHING </p><p>GENERATION, THE FIRST GENERATION BORN AND EDUCATED UNDER </p><p>THE REVOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) FIDEL SEEMS -- IN HIS WALK, GESTURES, ETC. -- </p><p>OLDER THAN HIS SEVENTY YEARS.  YOUNGER BROTHER HAUL </p><p>EASILY OUTWITTED HIM IN A CHILDRENS GAME PLAYED DURING </p><p>THE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION IN WHICH EACH COMPETED TO LIST </p><p>ITEMS BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER "M":  FIDEL STUMBLED </p><p>AFTER PROFERRING "WOMEN" (MUJERES) AND "MACEISTAS" </p><p>(INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS).  THESE LAPSES NOTWITHSTANDING, </p><p>THERE ARE PROBABLY STILL MANY YEARS OF LIFE LEFT IN THIS </p><p>AGING T0TALITARIAN REBEL. </p><p> </p><p>K0ZAK </p><p></p></div>
