<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 008381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: KABILA\'S "SELF-DEFENSE FORCES" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KINSHASA \'99 </p><p>     B. 8034 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN A MOVE THAT MAKES KINSHASA RESIDENTS NERVOUS, </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA HAS APPARENTLY DECIDED TO REVIVE THE </p><p>"PEOPLE\'S SELF-DEFENSE FORCES" (FAP), THE ARMED WING OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S POWER COMMITTEES (CPP).  KABILA FIRST AIRED THE IDEA </p><p>OF ARMING NEIGHBORHOOD MILITIAS ONE YEAR AGO (REFTEL), BUT </p><p>HAS NOT FOLLOWED UP ON HIS IDEA UNTIL NOW.  HOWEVER, DURING A </p><p>PUBLIC CEREMONY ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14 AT NDJILI AIRPORT, </p><p>VICE-GOVERNOR OF KINSHASA CHRISTOPHE MUZUNGU ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA HAD TASKED HIM WITH REVIVING THE FAP. </p><p>KABILA\'S MILITARY ADVISOR, EDDY KAPEND, WAS ON HAND FOR THE </p><p>CEREMONY.  THE VICE-GOVERNOR TOLD THE CPP-ORGANIZED CROWD </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT KABILA, IN REVIVING THE FAP, WAS DRAWING ON </p><p>THE EXAMPLE OF VIETNAM "WHERE DURING THE WAR EVEN OLD PEOPLE </p><p>HAD TO BEAR ARMS."  FOLLOWING MUZUNGU\'S SPEECH, THE LEADER OF </p><p>NDJILI\'S CPP REPORTEDLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD SPENT TWO </p><p>MONTHS TRAINING THE NDJILI FAP AND THAT "THEY WERE READY TO </p><p>RECEIVE THEIR WEAPONS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS SINCE THE CEREMONY AT NDJILI, </p><p>MUZUNGU HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING ALL KINSHASA RESIDENTS TO </p><p>REGISTER WITH THE FAP OUT OF "PATRIOTIC DUTY."  AT CPP/FAP </p><p>RALLY IN KINSHASA ON SUNDAY, MUZUNGU REPORTEDLY ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT 120,000 RECRUITS HAD ALREADY ENROLLED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT (RIGHT ON THE </p><p>HEELS OF THE SIX-MONTH MONUC EXTENSION), SOME OBSERVERS HAVE </p><p>SPECULATED THAT KABILA\'S REASON FOR ARMING THE FAC IS TO </p><p>INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SECURITY FORCES IN KINSHASA PRIOR TO A </p><p>LARGER UN DEPLOYMENT.  VICE-GOVERNOR MUZUNGU DENIED THIS </p><p>CLAIM IN A PUBLISHED INTERVIEW ON DECEMBER 18 WITH </p><p>INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER "LA REFERENCE PLUS", EXPLAINING THAT </p><p>THE PRIMARY REASON FOR ARMING THE FAP WOULD BE TO COUNTER THE </p><p>RECENT INCREASE IN ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS BY SOLDIERS AND </p><p>POLICE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE WIDELY-HELD BELIEF THAT ARMING </p><p>THE FAP WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF WORSENING RATHER THAN </p><p>IMPROVING THE SECURITY SITUATION IN KINSHASA, MUZUNGU ASSURED </p><p>"LA REFERENCE PLUS" READERS THAT THE FAP WOULD BE VERY WELL </p><p>TRAINED AND HIGHLY ORGANIZED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: KABILA\'S PLAN TO ARM THE FAP MAY FIZZLE THIS </p><p>YEAR, JUST AS IT DID LAST YEAR.  THERE ARE ALREADY NUMEROUS </p><p>ARMED SERVICES IN KINSHASA, WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF POLICE AND </p><p>MILITARY FORCES ROAMING THE STREETS.  MOREOVER, IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT EVEN PRESIDENT KABILA WOULD GIVE </p><p>WEAPONS TO PLAIN-CLOTHED CIVILIANS WITH AN AMBIGUOUS MANDATE. </p><p> THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FAP CAN MOST LIKELY BE VIEWED AS A </p><p>PR MOVE INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE RESPONSIVENESS TO THE </p><p>INCREASE IN ATTACKS BY SOLDIERS AGAINST CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: IF KABILA DOES GO THROUGH WITH </p><p>PLANS TO ARM THE FAP, KINSHASA RESIDENTS WILL NO DOUBT </p><p>WITNESS JURISDICTIONAL BATTLES BETWEEN THE NEWLY-ARMED </p><p>CIVILIANS AND THE POLICE.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, ANOTHER </p><p>"SECURITY SERVICE" WON\'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NON-PAYMENT OF </p><p>SALARIES AND THE DISASTROUS ECONOMIC SITUATION IN KINSHASA. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
