<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03,  OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; NAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Only George Bush could make Chirac look like a </p><p>dove" </p><p>Columnist Paul Knox commented in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (2/26): "...Mr. Bush has managed to drive the </p><p>deepest wedge in half a century between the </p><p>United States and Europe over an issue tangential to </p><p>counterterrorism, which is the central challenge of his </p><p>presidency. Every time his pal Tony Blair </p><p>digs himself out of a public-opinion hole, Mr. Bush </p><p>pushes him back in with another dose of illogic and </p><p>mendacity. The U.S. President has single-handedly </p><p>resuscitated the global antiwar movement - no mean feat </p><p>in a post-9/11 world. And he\'s accomplished something </p><p>Bill Clinton could only dream of: He\'s actually made </p><p>people feel good about being liberals once again. That, </p><p>of course, is not such a bad thing. But there is a </p><p>great tragedy about Mr. Bush\'s meltdown in the arena of </p><p>international public opinion. His obsession with </p><p>military action has made it easy for others to avoid </p><p>addressing the plight of civilians in Iraq, and their </p><p>claim on a brighter future.... The humanitarian plight </p><p>of Iraqis has been trotted out </p><p>so belatedly by Mr. Bush and his allies that it lacks </p><p>all credibility as a pretext for war. In any case, </p><p>their overwhelming focus continues to be WMD.... If the </p><p>current crisis is defused, there is no reason why the </p><p>focus of United Nations involvement can\'t be broadened </p><p>from weapons of mass destruction to include a mechanism </p><p>to address the civil, political, social </p><p>and economic rights of Iraqis. Those who would be </p><p>peacemongers should make that their overriding goal." </p><p> </p><p>2.   Saddam\'s Missiles </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (2/26): "If not for the interview granted by </p><p>Saddam Hussein to Dan Rather, the chances the memo </p><p>written by Paris and Berlin - and endorsed by Moscow </p><p>and Beijing - had of being adopted by the Security </p><p>Council would have been much greater. But Saddam caught </p><p>everybody by surprise and gave the Bush-Blair </p><p>duo...everything it wanted, namely a reason to send </p><p>armies to Baghdad. Indeed, Saddam\'s clear refusal </p><p>during this interview not to destroy the missiles </p><p>constitutes the motive the war side was waiting for.... </p><p>If Hussein sticks to his guns, it is likely neither </p><p>Bush nor Blair will be forced to demand a vote at the </p><p>Security Council on their new resolution. More exactly, </p><p>if Hussein decides to keep arms prohibited by the UN, </p><p>he will reduce to ashes the position defended by </p><p>Germany, France, China and Russia." </p><p> </p><p>NAM </p><p>3.   "No friends, only enemies" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "Paranoid North Koreans shun </p><p>even sympathetic leaders," columnist Jonathan Manthorpe </p><p>observed in the conservative tabloid </p><p>Vancouver Sun (2/26): "...The efforts of the NAM summit </p><p>have been models of moderation beside the sometimes </p><p>charged language in the meeting hall. NAM members </p><p>include the three countries of Bush\'s axis of evil as </p><p>well as five temporary members of the 15-member UN </p><p>Security Council that will soon turn thumbs up or down </p><p>on military action against Iraq. Their resolution on </p><p>Iraq, for example, supports the disarming of Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s regime, but only by </p><p>the UN and not by the U.S. acting independently with </p><p>allies. The resolution does not preclude military </p><p>action under a UN mandate if all else fails.... </p><p>NAM delegates wanted to take a similar stance over </p><p>North Korea. A draft resolution negotiated in corridors </p><p>and back-rooms over the past few days </p><p>would have called on Pyongyang to reverse its decision </p><p>late last year to withdraw from the nuclear Non- </p><p>Proliferation Treaty.... The problem for everyone - </p><p>North Korea\'s neighbours at least as much as the U.S. - </p><p>is that Pyongyang does have weapons of mass destruction </p><p>and a highly competent and motivated million-man army. </p><p>Saddam, in contrast, probably has only the remnants of </p><p>his dreams to acquire a mass killing machine. Erratic </p><p>North Korea is such a dangerous proposition it has to </p><p>be handled delicately while Iraq does not." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
