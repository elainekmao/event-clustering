IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON MARCH 13, CHARGE EARL IRVING AND ECONOFF </p><p>(NOTETAKER) MET WITH COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) </p><p>PRESIDENT TIM HENWOOD AND DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK AT </p><p>THEIR REQUEST TO DISCUSS THE USG\'S POSITION ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  HENWOOD ASKED THE CHARGE ABOUT THE </p><p>MARCH 11 ARTICLE THAT APPEARED IN THE "THE SUNDAY TIMES" </p><p>OF LONDON (THE PAPER AND INTERNET VERSIONS) ENTITLED </p><p>"BRITAIN SCORNS \'SINISTER\' BID TO END LAND GRAB."  THIS </p><p>ARTICLE STATED THAT THERE EXISTS A "\'SINISTER\' AMERICAN- </p><p>BACKED DEAL TO END THE CRISIS FACING WHITE FARMERS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE" OVER LAND REFORM.  CHARGE TOLD HENWOOD THAT </p><p>THERE IS NO VALIDITY WHATSOEVER TO THE ARTICLE.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE USG WAS NOT PURSUING SECRET TALKS </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON LAND REFORM, </p><p>AND THE OFFICIAL USG POSITION IS THAT WHILE WE SUPPORT </p><p>THE NEED FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, IT SHOULD BE DONE </p><p>IN A LEGAL AND TRANSPARENT MANNER, BASED ON THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES AGREED TO AT THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE HELD </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE.  HENWOOD WAS REASSURED BECAUSE HE STATED </p><p>THAT THE "CFU IS FEELING A BIT LONELY THESE DAYS."  THE </p><p>CHARGE REASSURED THE CFU EXECUTIVES THAT THE USG </p><p>REMAINED DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN IN THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS AND THE VIOLENCE </p><p>DIRECTED BY "WAR VETS" AT COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01021  01 OF 02  150524Z </p><p>WORKERS.  HE ADDED THAT WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE THIS </p><p>CONCERN TO THE GOZ, AND THAT ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY BELLAMY HAD FORTHRIGHTLY </p><p>COMMUNICATED THIS CONCERN TO THE GOZ DURING HIS RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HENWOOD AND HASLUCK BOTH INQUIRED ABOUT THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>ACT (ZDERA), AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE ACT COULD </p><p>BECOME LAW.  THE CHARGE PROVIDED THE CFU EXECUTIVES WITH </p><p>A COPY OF THE ZDERA INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE, AND </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE ZDERA WAS NOT ASSURED, </p><p>BUT THAT RECENT GOZ ACTIONS AGAINST THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>PRESS AND THE JUDICIARY HAD PUT THE SPOTLIGHT BACK ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.  HASLUCK ALSO ASKED </p><p>IF A NEW REGIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAD BEEN SELECTED </p><p>AS WELL AS A NEW AMBASSADOR FOR ZIMBABWE.  THE CHARGE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT WALTER KANSTEINER HAD BEEN PROPOSED AS </p><p>THE NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR AFRICA, AND WOULD LIKELY </p><p>BE CONFIRMED.  WHILE A NEW AMBASSADOR HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>CHOSEN, HE INFORMED THEM THAT THE PROPOSED NEW DCM WAS </p><p>ROBERT WHITEHEAD.  THE CHARGE OPINED THAT BOTH MEN HAVE </p><p>SOLID EXPERIENCE WITH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE, AND ARE </p><p>EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CHOICES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHARGE ASKED HENWOOD AND HASLUCK ABOUT THE </p><p>UPCOMING MARCH 21 CFU SPECIAL CONGRESS, AND WHETHER WE </p><p>SHOULD EXPECT ANY SURPRISES OR "FIREWORKS" TO COME OUT </p><p>OF IT.  HENWOOD ANSWERED THAT HE BELIEVES THE CURRENT </p><p>CFU EXECUTIVE HAS THE SOLID BACKING OF A MAJORITY OF CFU </p><p>MEMBERS, AND THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT THERE WOULD BE A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01021  01 OF 02  150524Z </p><p>CHALLENGE TO THE UNION\'S LEADERSHIP.  HOWEVER, HE DID </p><p>ASK WHETHER THE CHARGE HAD TALKED WITH JOHN BREDENKAMP, </p><p>WHO IS MENTIONED IN THE "THE SUNDAY TIMES" ARTICLE.  THE </p><p>CHARGE REPLIED THAT HE HAD NEVER MET WITH BREDENKAMP, </p><p>NOR, TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, HAD ANY OTHER MEMBERS </p><p>OF EMBASSY STAFF.  HENWOOD APPEARED RELIEVED BY THIS </p><p>ANSWER.  HE WENT ON TO DESCRIBE BREDENKAMP AS A </p><p>NEFARIOUS CHARACTER THAT IS INVOLVED IN, AMONG OTHER </p><p>ACTIVITIES, ARMS TRADING ON THE BLACK MARKET.  HENWOOD </p><p>STATED THAT BREDENKAMP IS NOT A COMMERCIAL FARMER, AND </p><p>THAT HIS ONLY APPARENT LINK TO THE LAND ISSUE IS THROUGH </p><p>HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH NICK SWANEPOEL, A FORMER CFU </p><p>PRESIDENT.  HE ADDED THAT NEITHER SWANEPOEL NOR </p><p>BREDENKAMP REPRESENT THE CFU OR ITS MEMBERSHIP, AND THAT </p><p>ANY DEALS THEY ARE NEGOTIATING ARE VERY SUSPECT IN HIS </p><p>EYES.  HENWOOD STATED THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF SWANEPOEL </p><p>IS VERY LOW WITH THE CFU MEMBERSHIP, BECAUSE HIS </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF A SECRET DEAL BETWEEN THE GOZ AND THE USG </p><p>THAT INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL FINANCING FOR "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>PROVED TO BE NOT TRUE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS WILL NOT FOCUS ON CFU LEADERSHIP, BUT RATHER ON </p><p>THE CONSIDERATION OF STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TO TAKE TO </p><p>BENEFIT THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF COMMERCIAL FARMING IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AS WELL AS SHORT-TERM MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE </p><p>CURRENT POLITICAL CONUNDRUM AND THE PRESSURES COMMERCIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1228 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01021  02 OF 02  150524Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------D1E4F3  150524Z /38 </p><p>R 150521Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8428 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001021 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAGR, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S EMBATTLED CFU PRESIDENT SEEKS </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF USG POSITION ON "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01021  02 OF 02  150524Z </p><p> </p><p>FARMERS ARE FACING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: BOTH HASLUCK AND HENWOOD WERE CLEARLY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE USG HAD SHIFTED ITS POSITION ON THE </p><p>GOZ\'S "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM, AND WERE EQUALLY RELIEVED TO </p><p>HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE CHARGE THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>SUBSTANCE TO THE RUMORS OF "A SECRET DEAL INVOLVING THE </p><p>AMERICANS."  WE EMPHASIZED TO THE CFU EXECUTIVES THAT </p><p>THE USG WILL SUPPORT LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, BUT ONLY </p><p>WHEN IT IS DONE IN A LEGAL, TRANSPARENT AND SUSTAINABLE </p><p>MANNER AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS.  AS IN </p><p>OTHER RECENT MEETINGS WITH CFU OFFICIALS, HASLUCK AND </p><p>HENWOOD WERE NOT VERY CONVINCING WHEN STATING THAT THEIR </p><p>LEADERSHIP WOULD NOT BE CHALLENGED AT THE SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS.  THE MARCH 14 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT "THE </p><p>DAILY NEWS" CARRIED AN ARTICLE INDICATING THAT SWANEPOEL </p><p>STILL INTENDS TO PROPOSE AT THE CONGRESS A PLAN TO REACH </p><p>A COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CFU AND THE GOZ ON </p><p>LAND REFORM.  THIS PLAN, AS REPORTED REFTEL, INCLUDES </p><p>REPLACING THE CURRENT CFU EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP.  WE DO </p><p>NOT HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF SWANEPOEL\'S BACKING AMONG THE </p><p>GENERAL CFU MEMBERSHIP, AND THEREFORE, CANNOT PREDICT </p><p>HOW MUCH SUPPORT HIS PLAN MAY GARNER FROM FARMERS WEARY </p><p>OF STRUGGLING WITH THE FARM INVASIONS AND THE CLIMATE OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE FROM THE "WAR VETS".  ONE </p><p>THING WE CAN PREDICT IS THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>FIREWORKS AT THE CFU\'S SPECIAL CONGRESS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01021  02 OF 02  150524Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
