<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ENRG, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH REGULATORS ON TAKEOVER OF UZAN\'S BANK AND </p><p>ENERGY CONCESSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 4061 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 4026 </p><p>     C. (C) ANKARA 3784 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Turkish banking regulatory authorities </p><p>say their July 3-4 decision to take over management (and </p><p>revoke the license) of Uzan family-owned Imar Bank was the </p><p>result of a severe bank liquidity squeeze, which was prompted </p><p>by the government\'s earlier revocation of the family\'s energy </p><p>concessions in southern Turkey.  Bank regulators seized </p><p>management control -- but not ownership -- and plan to </p><p>liquidate the bank, paying off depositors but leaving other </p><p>liabilities to the bank owners to cover.  Energy market </p><p>regulators say they were behind the government\'s June 12 </p><p>decision to revoke the concession agreements of Cukurova </p><p>Electrik and Kepez, based on the companies\' failure to </p><p>transfer their electricity transmission assets to the state, </p><p>as well as numerous other contractual violations.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) As reported in ref A, the GOT on June 12 announced </p><p>that it had annulled the concession agreements of Cukurova </p><p>Elektrik and Kepez, both owned by the infamous Uzan family, </p><p>to operate eleven dams and a 5,000 kilometer energy </p><p>transmission grid in southern Turkey.  Energy Market </p><p>Regulatory Authority (EMRA) President Yusuf Gunay told us </p><p>that he had pressed the government for several weeks to take </p><p>this step in rsponse to the companies\' failure to comply with </p><p>various legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) According to Gunay, the main problem was the </p><p>companies\' refusal to transfer their transmission assets to </p><p>the state, as required by the Electricity Law.  Gunay </p><p>explained that, while the original concessions authorized the </p><p>companies to operate transmission facilities, the subsequent </p><p>Electricty Law prohibited private operation of such </p><p>facilities.  As the concession agreement required the </p><p>companies to conform with any future legislative changes, </p><p>Gunay said, the Uzans had no legal basis to say "no" to the </p><p>GOT.  Moreover, per Gunay, the companies consistently ignored </p><p>EMRA\'s pricing policies, failed to allow full third-party </p><p>access to the grid, and failed to provide reliable service to </p><p>industrial groups (notably the Sabanci Group). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On July 3-4, the Banking Regulation and Supervision </p><p>Agency (BRSA) announced that it was revoking the license of </p><p>Imar Bank, also owned by the Uzan family, and that it would </p><p>take over management in order to liquidate the bank.  BRSA </p><p>Vice President Teoman Kerman explained the decision to us on </p><p>July 11, as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Until June 12, BRSA had no major problems with the bank. </p><p>Although its group lending exceeded the legal limit (25 </p><p>percent of net worth), the owners had injected additional </p><p>capital and were complying with a BRSA-imposed timetable to </p><p>reduce group lending to the legal limit.  (Note:  Kerman </p><p>explained that, under Turkish law, banks have a transition </p><p>period until end-2006 to reach the 25 percent limit, unless </p><p>the group lending poses a threat to their viability before </p><p>that date.  In the case of Imar Bank, BRSA\'s assessment was </p><p>that the group lending was not an imminent threat.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- After the government\'s June 12 revocation of the power </p><p>concession agreements, BRSA grew concerned about the bank\'s </p><p>viability.  The electricity companies not only contributed </p><p>significantly to the Uzan Group\'s profitability, but also </p><p>were key sources of liquidity for the bank.  When depositors </p><p>began withdrawing funds after June 12, the bank lacked the </p><p>liquidity to meet the demand.  Bank management sought help </p><p>from the BRSA, which legally could not help, and from the </p><p>Central Bank, which refused to inject liquidity because the </p><p>bank lacked collateral. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On or about July 1, the bank management resigned en masse, </p><p>after having paid out some TL 150 trillion (just over $100 </p><p>million dollars) to depositors.  The owners called for a </p><p>General Assembly to select a new management team, but BRSA </p><p>determined that the bank\'s precarious state required </p><p>immediate action.  Kerman could not recall the exact </p><p>chronology (and BRSA\'s announcement is unclear), but on July </p><p>3-4, BRSA revoked the bank\'s license, and transferred </p><p>management to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Unlike in previous takeovers, SDIF took over management </p><p>control but not ownership of the bank, and also is </p><p>guaranteeing only deposits rather than providing a blanket </p><p>guarantee for all liabilities.  Kerman explained that, in </p><p>previous bank takevoers, the banks in question had a negative </p><p>net worth, so SDIF had taken ownership and continued to </p><p>operate the bank.  Imar Bank, however, had a positive net </p><p>worth of some TL 180 trillion.  Under Turkish law, if SDIF </p><p>takes over a bank with a positive net worth, it must pay that </p><p>net worth to the owners.  Moreover, nearly all of Imar Bank\'s </p><p>non-desposit liabilities were owed to the Uzan Group, and the </p><p>SDIF would also have had to pay those liabilities.  Given </p><p>these special circumstances, regulators determined that it </p><p>would be less expensive to the government not to take </p><p>ownership, but to seize management control, pay off </p><p>depositors, and liquidate the bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- As a result, the bank has stopped operating, and SDIF is </p><p>preparing to cover all outstanding deposits (once it gains </p><p>access to account information).  It will take over and seek </p><p>to liquidate the banks assets -- mostly loans to Uzan Group </p><p>companies -- by requiring borrowers to repay the loans over a </p><p>schedule to be negotiated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Kerman insisted that BRSA\'s decision to take over </p><p>the bank was based purely on the financial merits, and that </p><p>there had been no political pressure of any kind.  He </p><p>estimated that the Uzan Group would have the financial </p><p>wherewithal to repay most if not all of the loans owed to the </p><p>bank, so the net cost to the Treasury of the takeover should </p><p>be small.  In the worst-case scenario, involving SDIF being </p><p>unable to liquidate any of the bank\'s assets, the total cost </p><p>to Treasury would equal the bank\'s deposits of TL 800 </p><p>trillion. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
