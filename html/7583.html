(U)  This is an action message.  Please see </p><p>paragraph three. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Amcit Farhan Bakir, a prominent doctor in </p><p>the UAE (he is the personal physician of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and </p><p>served in a similar capacity to a number of Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s predecessors), met with PolChief 4/21 to ask </p><p>how Iraqi expat doctors could be integrated into the </p><p>ongoing relief effort in Iraq.  Bakir is well known in </p><p>Iraqi expat political circles, having been invited to </p><p>serve on the medical committee focus group which met </p><p>in Washington.  A cardio-pulmonary specialist, he said </p><p>that he is in contact with a number of fellow expat </p><p>Iraqi doctors, many of them American citizens living </p><p>in the UAE, who would like to volunteer to travel to </p><p>Iraq to help the humanitarian effort.  These doctors </p><p>speak Arabic, are familiar with the Iraqi health </p><p>system, and would be available to deploy on short </p><p>notice.  We estimate that there are at least ten </p><p>doctors who would be available for this activity, </p><p>possibly more.  Bakir asked for guidance on modalities </p><p>and perceived usefulness of such an effort, before </p><p>proceeding further with it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  We believe </p><p>that Bakir\'s group could provide meaningful </p><p>assistance.  They realize that Baghdad may be becoming </p><p>saturated and would be willing to serve elsewhere, </p><p>particularly in Southern Iraq.  Beyond the very real </p><p>practical benefit that these doctors could provide, </p><p>the optics of our facilitating this effort strike us </p><p>as highly beneficial.  We would appreciate guidance </p><p>from the appropriate addressees as to how we should </p><p>respond to Bakir\'s inquiry. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
