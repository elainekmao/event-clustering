<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003143 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AID ADM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR AFR/WA, MIKE KARBELING </p><p>ABUJA FOR ADMIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, APER, ECON, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: WORLD AIDS DAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: RE: WORLD AIDS DAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  ON SATURDAY DECEMBER 1, THE NATIONAL </p><p>ACTION COMMITTEE FOR AIDS (NACA) ORGANIZED A DAYLONG </p><p>CALENDAR OF EVENTS TO COMMEMORATE WORLD AIDS DAY IN </p><p>ABUJA THAT INCLUDED A PLENARY SESSION FOR MAJOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT ACTORS, A CITY TOUR AND </p><p>RALLY, AND A SOCCER COMPETITION.  THE PLENARY SESSION </p><p>INCLUDED BRIEFINGS BY MINISTRY AND DONOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OUTLINING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL HIV/AIDS EFFORT, AND AN EVENT HONORING PEOPLE </p><p>LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).  THE CONCLUSIONS THAT CAN </p><p>BE DRAWN FROM ATTENDANCE AT THIS SESSION ARE AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: 1) NACA IS NOW FIRMLY IN CHARGE OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL PROGRAM AND THE APPROACH IS AVOWEDLY MULTI- </p><p>SECTORAL.  FOR INSTANCE, THE MINISTERS OF WOMEN AFFAIRS </p><p>AND LABOR PERSONALLY REPORTED ON THEIR ACTIVITIES WHILE </p><p>OTHER MINISTERS WERE REPRESENTED BY OTHER HIGH LEVEL </p><p>FUNCTIONARIES.  2) THE PROMINENCE OF PLWHAS IN THE </p><p>PROGRAM SIGNIFIES INCREASED NACA/GFRN ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>THEIR CRITICAL ROLE IN DISEASE MITIGATION.  IN THE </p><p>FUTURE PLWHAS ARE CERTAIN TO FIGURE CENTRALLY IN </p><p>NATIONAL EFFORTS TO ALLEVIATE STIGMA AND </p><p>DISCRIMINATION.  3) SEVERAL PLWHAS MADE FRANK COMMENTS </p><p>ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL HIV/AIDS INTERVENTIONS AND THE </p><p>EXISTENCE OF GOVERNMENTAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST </p><p>PLWHAS.  THIS DEMONSTRATED A FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION THAT </p><p>DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ALSO CITED </p><p>USAID AS THE MAJOR PARTNER SUPPORTING ITS CRITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES SEVERAL TIMES DURING HIS PRESENTATION.   THE </p><p>ENTIRE DAY  EVENTS WERE WELL COVERED BY THE MEDIA BUT </p><p>THE POOR QUALITY OF THAT COVERAGE SUGGESTS A CRITICAL </p><p>NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. NACA LEADERSHIP: NACA  ORGANIZATION OF THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY AND THE DEGREE OF REPRESENTATION FROM ALL </p><p>SECTORS SUGGEST THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS FINALLY COME </p><p>OF AGE AND IS IN CHARGE OF THE NATION  HIV/AIDS </p><p>RESPONSE.  CDC AND USAID HAVE BEEN MAJOR SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>NACA SINCE THE ORGANIZATION  CREATION AND OF THE </p><p>MULTI-SECTOR APPROACH.   IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>GENERALLY HIGH LEVEL MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR </p><p>REPORTS ON THE ACTIVITIES BEING IMPLEMENTED IN EACH OF </p><p>THE MINISTRIES SUGGESTS THAT THE MINISTRIES ARE BEING </p><p>HELD PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING HIV/AIDS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE SUBSTANCE ARE ALSO THE ONLY ONES RECEIVING </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE DONORS; THE MINISTRY OF LABOR </p><p>AND PRODUCTIVITY RECEIVES HELP FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LABOR ORGANIZATION AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RECEIVES </p><p>USAID FUNDING.  THE LACK OF REAL SUBSTANCE OF MOST OF </p><p>THE PROGRAMS SUGGESTS THAT CERTAIN KEY MINISTRIES HAVE </p><p>A CRITICAL NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING IN HIV/AIDS PROGRAMMING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. PLWHAS:  AN EVENT SPOTLIGHTING PLWHAS WAS A MAJOR </p><p>COMPONENT OF THE PLENARY SESSION AND INCLUDED THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF PLWHAS TO THE GUESTS OF HONOR AND </p><p>SPEECHES BY MUHAMMAD FAROUK, NATIONAL COORDINATOR OF </p><p>THE USAID-SUPPORTED NATIONAL AIDS ALLIANCE, AND SENATOR </p><p>KHAIRAT GWADABE, WHO WAS REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE SENATE.  MR. FAROUK CONGRATULATED THE GFRN ON ITS </p><p>LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE PLANNED PROVISION OF ANTIVIRALS </p><p>WHILE HE ALSO MADE A PLEA FOR THE DRUG PROVISION </p><p>PROGRAM TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL ORGANIZED AND MANAGED. </p><p> ACCORDING TO HIM, AN ILL-MANAGED ANTIVIRAL PROGRAM </p><p>RUNS THE RISK OF DEVASTATING RATHER THAN IMPROVING THE </p><p>HEALTH OF PLWHAS.   SENATOR GWADABE MADE A GRACIOUS </p><p>SPEECH IN WHICH SHE COMMENDED THE PLWHAS PRESENT FOR </p><p>THEIR COURAGE IN  OING PUBLIC ITH THE DISEASE AND </p><p>FOR THEIR SERVICE TO THE NATION IN DOING SO.   ONE </p><p>PLWHA, A SERVING LIEUTENANT IN THE NIGERIAN NAVY, </p><p>CRITICIZED THE ARMED FORCES FOR THEIR DISCRIMINATION </p><p>AGAINST PLWHAS INCLUDING THE DENIAL OF THEIR RIGHTS AND </p><p>PRIVILEGES.  HE CITED, FOR INSTANCE, THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>SPECIAL ISOLATED HOSPITAL WARDS FOR PLWHAS, THE LACK OF </p><p>MEDICINES TO TREAT THE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS OF </p><p>ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, AND THE REFUSAL TO SEND PLWHAS ON </p><p>OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENTS OR FOR OVERSEAS TRAINING.  THE </p><p>LIEUTENANT ALSO CRITICIZED THE MINISTERS WHO WERE NOT </p><p>PRESENT AT THE SESSION BUT WHO INSTEAD WERE  BLY </p><p>REPRESENTED Y OTHERS.  HE SAID THE MINISTERS WOULD BE </p><p>THERE PERSONALLY IF VOTES WERE INVOLVED AND THUS URGED </p><p>ALL PLWHAS TO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. THE MEDIA: AN OPEN PRESS SESSION NEAR THE END OF THE </p><p>MEETING UNDERLINED THE NEED TO REINFORCE ONGOING </p><p>EFFORTS TO EDUCATE THE PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA ON </p><p>ISSUES INVOLVING HIV/AIDS.  ONE QUESTION DIRECTED TO </p><p>THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, ASKED WHEN LEGISLATION WOULD BE PASSED TO </p><p>PROHIBIT HIV+ WOMEN FROM HAVING CHILDREN AND THUS FROM </p><p>PASSING ON THE VIRUS.  THIS QUESTION WAS PROBABLY </p><p>STIMULATED BY THE STATISTICS CONCERNING MOTHER TO CHILD </p><p>TRANSMISSION (I.E. ONE-THIRD OF AFRICAN BABIES BORN TO </p><p>HIV INFECTED MOTHERS WILL BE UNINTENTIONALLY INFECTED </p><p>VIA CHILD BIRTH AND BREASTFEEDING) GIVEN DURING </p><p>PRELIMINARY SPEECHES AND THE PRESENCE AMONG THE PLWHAS </p><p>OF SEVERAL WOMEN WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AND/OR PREGNANT. </p><p>THIS QUESTION AND SEVERAL OTHERS SHOWING LACK OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING ESPECIALLY OF THE HUMAN AND REPRODUCTIVE </p><p>RIGHTS OF PLWHAS DREW IMMEDIATE, NEGATIVE REACTIONS </p><p>FROM THE CROWD. SEVERAL PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE </p><p>MEDIA  CAPACITY TO REPORT ON HIV/AIDS ISSUES ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. THOMAS HOBGOOD, USAID DIRECTOR, WHO DELIVERED A </p><p>SHORT SPEECH OUTLINING US SUPPORT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>HIV/AIDS BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND IN NIGERIA, </p><p>REPRESENTED THE USG.  THE BODY OF HIS SPEECH IS AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> R. CHAIRMAN, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SENATE </p><p>PRESIDENT, HONORABLE MINISTERS AND THEIR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, MEMBERS OF THE HIGH TABLE, </p><p>NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, YOUNG PEOPLE OF </p><p>NIGERIA, PEOPLE LIVING WITH AIDS HERE PRESENT, </p><p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE AND TO GIVE A GOODWILL </p><p>MESSAGE ON BEHALF OF THE US GOVERNMENT ON THIS </p><p>WORLD AIDS DAY.  THE US GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGES </p><p>THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIV/AIDS FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE </p><p>AROUND THE WORLD.  LAST YEAR MORE PEOPLE </p><p>CONTRACTED HIV AND MORE DIED OF AIDS THAN IN ANY </p><p>OTHER YEAR. EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL GLOBAL AIDS </p><p>DEATHS AND 70 PERCENT OF ALL NEW HIV INFECTIONS </p><p>ARE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.   AN ESTIMATED 34 </p><p>MILLION AFRICANS ARE CURRENTLY INFECTED WITH THE </p><p>VIRUS AND OVER 3 MILLION OF THAT TOTAL ARE </p><p>NIGERIANS.   WE ARE PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED TO SEE </p><p>SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT OBASANJO AND NGOS ALL </p><p>INDICATING THEIR SUPPORT TO COMBAT THE AIDS </p><p>EPIDEMIC IN NIGERIA.  THE EPIDEMIC HAS EVOLVED </p><p>FROM A HEALTH ISSUE TO ONE THAT IMPACTS ON ALL </p><p>SECTORS, THEREBY NECESSITATING A COLLECTIVE AND </p><p>URGENT RESPONSE.   IN MANY COUNTRIES IT IS </p><p>CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE INTERNATIONALLY: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A). THE UNITED STATES IS THE LARGEST BILATERAL </p><p>DONOR OF HIV/AIDS ASSISTANCE, CURRENTLY PROVIDING </p><p>NEARLY 40 PERCENT OF ALL INTERNATIONAL HIV/AIDS </p><p>FUNDING. SINCE 1986, THROUGH THE U.S. AGENCY FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ALONE, THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS DEDICATED OVER $1.6 BILLION FOR THE </p><p>PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC </p><p>IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B). THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS CONTINUED THIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THIS YEAR, USAID  HIV/AIDS BUDGET </p><p>WILL INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\'S, AND PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE THE </p><p>FIRST DONOR TO THE NEW GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, </p><p>TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA, WITH AN INITIAL PLEDGE </p><p>OF $200 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A). THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS ONE OF THE </p><p>LARGEST BILATERAL DONORS OF HIV/AIDS ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>NIGERIA.  THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL </p><p>PROGRAM PROVIDES TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND MATERIAL </p><p>SUPPORT AMOUNTING TO APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION </p><p>ANNUALLY. USAID FUNDING FOR HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS HAS </p><p>INCREASED FROM $2.6 MILLION IN 1999 TO $12.3 </p><p>MILLION IN 2001, AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN </p><p>2003.  BOTH US GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WORK TO PROMOTE </p><p>THE OBJECTIVES OF THE HIV/AIDS EMERGENCY ACTION </p><p>PLAN (HEAP) AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL </p><p>ACTION COMMITTEE ON AIDS (NACA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED UNDER THE CENTERS </p><p>FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) PROGRAM ARE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A). SUPPORT TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO CONDUCT </p><p>HIV/SYPHILIS SEROPREVALENCE SURVEYS. </p><p>SEROPREVALENCE SURVEYS ARE NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE </p><p>THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HIV/AIDS PROBLEM IN NIGERIA </p><p>AND ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE </p><p>STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC.    THE FEDERAL </p><p>MINISTER OF HEALTH ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>LATEST 2001 CDC SUPPORTED SURVEY ON THURSDAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B). BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF SELECT LABORATORIES </p><p>TO PROVIDE QUALITY HIV TEST RESULTS.   FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, THE CDC RECENTLY CONDUCTED A NEEDS </p><p>ASSESSMENT AND PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE ABUJA REFERENCE LABORATORY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C). ESTABLISH VOLUNTARY AND CONFIDENTIAL </p><p>COUNSELING PROGRAMS.  SUCH PROGRAMS WILL SERVE AS </p><p>CRITICAL ENTRY POINTS TO THE NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR </p><p>PREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION, CARE </p><p>AND SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH AND THOSE </p><p>AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS, MANAGEMENT OF SEXUALLY </p><p>TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, AND IMPROVED BLOOD DONOR </p><p>SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE MAJOR FOCUSES OF THE USAID PROGRAM ARE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A). DEVELOPMENT OF A POSITIVE POLICY ENVIRONMENT </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF HIGH QUALITY HIV/AIDS SERVICES.  THE </p><p>POLICY PROJECT WORKS CLOSELY WITH NACA, THE </p><p>FEDERAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH  AIDS CONTROL PROGRAM, </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES, JOURNALISTS, RELIGIOUS LEADERS, </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS LEADERS AMONG OTHERS TO CREATE </p><p>WIDESPREAD GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY SUPPORT </p><p>FOR HIV/AIDS INTERVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B). PREVENTION:  NATIONWIDE, USAID CURRENTLY FUNDS </p><p>A SOCIAL MARKETING PROJECT WITH POPULATION </p><p>SERVICES INTERNATIONAL AND THE SOCIETY FOR FAMILY </p><p>HEALTH, A LOCAL NGO, TO PROMOTE RISK REDUCTION </p><p>BEHAVIOR AND USE OF PROVEN PREVENTIVE PRACTICES. </p><p>THESE EFFORTS ARE COMPLIMENTED BY FAMILY HEALTH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL  SUPPORT OF 56 COMMUNITY-BASED </p><p>PROJECTS THAT TARGET MULTIPLE POPULATIONS IN 12 </p><p>STATES WITHIN THE 6 GEOPOLITICAL ZONES OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ALSO SUPPORTS </p><p>THE ONLY PHONE HOTLINE FOR PEOPLE SEEKING </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL, ANONYMOUS INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C). CARE AND SUPPORT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH AND </p><p>AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS: FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL, </p><p>CEDPA, AND AFRICARE PROVIDE CARE AND SUPPORT </p><p>SERVICES FOR HIV POSITIVE PERSONS AND THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES AND ASSISTANCE TO ORPHANS AND OTHER </p><p>VULNERABLE CHILDREN AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE EXCELLENT EFFORTS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA IS MAKING TO FIGHT THIS </p><p>TERRIBLE DISEASE, I WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE </p><p>VALIANT EFFORT OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH </p><p>AS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A) THE NIGERIAN AIDS ALLIANCE </p><p>(B) SOCIETY FOR WOMEN AGAINST AIDS IN NIGERIA </p><p>(SWAAN) </p><p>(C) MUSLIMS SISTERS ORGANIZATION </p><p>(D) CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA </p><p>(E) NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIAN STUDENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MR. CHAIRMAN, HONORABLE MINISTERS, AND SENATE </p><p>PRESIDENT: YOU HAVE THE US GOVERNMENT  COMPLETE </p><p>COMMITMENT AND FULL SUPPORT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  THANK YOU. ETER. </p><p></p></div>
