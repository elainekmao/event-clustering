<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001090 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZIM\'S ELECTION TO COMMISSION ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Another victory over Britain," the </p><p>   government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated </p><p>   its May 2 editorial to hailing Zimbabwe\'s election </p><p>   to the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights as </p><p>   "an intrepid demonstration of the international </p><p>   community\'s confidence in the country," adding that </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s election was also a "victory over </p><p>   Britain and its allies who have ganged up to </p><p>   demonize" Mr. Mugabe\'s government. </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The election of Zimbabwe to the influential 15- </p><p>   member Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights is an </p><p>   intrepid demonstration of the international community\'s </p><p>   confidence in the country and its role in international </p><p>   affairs.  We applaud the latest victory over Britain </p><p>   and its allies who have ganged up to demonize the </p><p>   government and President Mugabe.  The election is </p><p>   recognition of Zimbabwe\'s respect for human rights and </p><p>   democracy.  It has also over-ridden the erroneous </p><p>   impression of a pariah state that has been portrayed by </p><p>   the Western media and some governments. . .  The latest </p><p>   British defeat means that alleged human rights abuses </p><p>   in Zimbabwe will not be used as a weapon to tarnish the </p><p>   image of the country. . .  Zimbabwe now needs to use </p><p>   its position on the 15-member commission to be the </p><p>   voice of the voiceless that have endured untold </p><p>   suffering at the hands of the same forces that seek to </p><p>   entrench their dominance on the earth.  We hope that </p><p>   sense will finally prevail and those tormenting </p><p>   Zimbabwe will realize that their sinister actions have </p><p>   been exposed.  The only way for them to save face would </p><p>   be to join the other nations in rallying behind </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s efforts to redistribute land." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
