<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 22570 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND; </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12536: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER PREL, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  THE </p><p>FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARA </p><p>FIVE OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES </p><p>THIS YEAR.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN SOVIETS ARRESTED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE AUGUST 19, 1990, HIJACKING OF AN </p><p>AEROFLOT PASSENGER AIRLINER ARE INCARCERATED IN </p><p>KARACHI AWAITING TRIAL.  (THE ELEVENTH RECENTLY </p><p>COMMITTED SUICIDE IN PRISON.)  THREE ANO TERRORISTS </p><p>CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI </p><p>REMAIN IN PRISON.  DURING THE RECENT ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED TO HAVE UNCOVERED A </p><p>"PLOT TO DESTABILIZE" THE COUNTRY, CENTERED IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF SINDH, ENCOURAGED BY THE INDIAN </p><p>EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND IMPLEMENTED BY </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH PAKISTAN\'S AL ZULFIKAR </p><p>ORGANIZATION ( A TERRORIST GROUP ACTIVE IN THE EARLY </p><p>1980S).  A NUMBER OF PAKISTANI SUSPECTS ARE IN JAIL; </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES CLAIM TO HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION </p><p>THROUGH CONFESSIONS OF INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EXTRADITIONS:  THERE WERE NONE; THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED EXTRADITION </p><p>OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  WE ARE NOT </p><p>AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC (I.E., LEGAL, </p><p>POLITICAL, OR PROCEDURAL) IMPEDIMENTS TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF PAKISTAN EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN </p><p>PROSECUTION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS </p><p>POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM AND, PUBLICLY AND </p><p>PRIVATELY, HAS CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORIST </p><p>VIOLENCE.  PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF NUMEROUS </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING 1990, PRIMARILY BOMBINGS </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT\'S INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE AND AFGHAN RESISTANCE GROUPS.  WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN APPEARS TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT </p><p>TO INVQGATE EACH INCIDENT FULLY, RESULTS ARE </p><p>HAMPERED BY THE POLICE\'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF </p><p>SOPHISTICATION IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>TECHNIQUES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT:  PAKISTAN HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY </p><p>MAJOR STEPS OR DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN 1990. </p><p>PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND ONE TRAINING </p><p>COURSE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT WAS PROVIDED THIS YEAR TO </p><p>EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN </p><p>HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE CENTRALIZED </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE AGENCIES, AND THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED </p><p>NATURE OF SENIOR LEVELS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>BUREAUCRACY, HAVE MADE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>DIFFICULT.  SINCE THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING, THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINED GOOD </p><p>AIRPORT SECURITY PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS.  INDIA </p><p>HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING </p><p>LOCAL INSURGENTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR, </p><p>INCLUDING PROVIDING OR TOLERATING SANCTUARIES AND </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN SAYS IT GIVES MORAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>THE KASHMIRI INSURGENTS BUT DENIES THE INDIAN </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OF TANGIBLE AID. </p><p> </p><p>8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN HAS NOT GIVEN ANY PUBLIC SUPPORT TO A </p><p>TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p>AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE, IT HAS NOT OFFERED ANY SUCH </p><p>SUPPORT PRIVATELY EITHER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989: </p><p>THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INQ </p><p>ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OAKLEY </p><p></p></div>
