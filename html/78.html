<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ALEXANDRIA 00524 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/IL AND NEA/RA - HOLLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, ELAB, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOR STRIKES IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A GENERALLY CALM </p><p>LABOR SCENE IN EGYPT, ALEXANDRIA SECURITY OFFICE HAS </p><p>CORROBORATED AN OPPOSITION PRESS REPORT THAT A LABOR </p><p>STRIKE HAD OCCURRED AT A FACTORY IN THE ALEXANDRIA SUBURB </p><p>OF ABU KIR.  HOWEVER, THE SOURCE PROFESSED IGNORANCE </p><p>CONCERNING THE OPPOSITION JOURNAL\'S ALLEGATION OF A </p><p>SECOND WORK STOPPAGE IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA, INVOLVING </p><p>A DEFENSE PLANT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BACKGROUND:  TRANQUIL LABOR SCENE.  SINCE THE FLARE- </p><p>UP OF WORKER VIOLENCE AT THE DELTA TEXTILE MANUFACTURING </p><p>CENTER OF KAFFAR AL-DAWWAR LAST SEPTEMBER, THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN LABOR SCENE, TO ALL APPEARANCES, HAS BEEN </p><p>GENERALLY CALM.  IN THE INTERVENING MONTHS, OUR TRADE </p><p>UNION CONTACTS--ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT </p><p>OF LABOR UNREST--HAVE REPEATEDLY ASSURED US THAT ALL IS </p><p>QUIET ON THE LABOR FRONT, PROTRAYING WORKERS\' RELATIONS </p><p>WITH BOTH MANAGEMENT AND THE GOE AS HARMONIOUS.  REFLECT- </p><p>ING THE PLACID LABOR SITUATION IS THE FACT THAT OF LATE, </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PRESS HAS OMITTED ANY MENTION OF STRIKES </p><p>OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT LABOR TROUBLE.  IN THE PAST, ONE </p><p>OPPOSITION PAPER IN PARTICULAR, THE LEFTIST NATIONAL </p><p>PROGRESSIVE UNIONIST GROUPING PARTY\'S (NPUG) WEEKLY, </p><p>AL-AHALI, HAD OCCASIONALLY ALLEGED THIS OCCURRENCE OF </p><p>STRIKES AND SIMILAR LABOR DIFFICULTIES.  AS FOR THE </p><p>"NATIONAL," PLO-GOE MEDIA, THEY AVOID DISCUSSION OF </p><p>LABOR TROUBLE ALTOGETHER. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  STRIKES IN ALEXANDRIA AREA.  ON JUNE 19, HOWEVER, </p><p>AL-AHALI BROKE ITS UNUSUAL SILENCE IN A BRIEF, PAGE-ONE </p><p>STORY, WHERE IT REPORTED THAT NATIONAL SECURITY POLICE </p><p>RECENTLY STORMED TWO FACTORIES IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA TO </p><p>BREAK UP MASS MEETINGS OF STRIKING WORKERS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE PAPER GAVE NO SPECIFIC DATES FOR THE INCIDENTS. END </p><p>COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO THE PAPER, IN BOTH INCIDENTS, </p><p>ONE INVOLVING THE ABU KIR ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES\' COMPANY </p><p>AND THE OTHER THE "MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT," POLICE </p><p>EVICTED THE STRIKERS AND THEN CLOSED THE FACTORIES. </p><p>AL-AHALI\'S ACCOUNT MADE NO REFERENCE TO ANY ARRESTS OR </p><p>INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE POLICE INTERVENTION.  WORKERS </p><p>STRUCK THE ABU KIR PLANT, SAID AL-AHALI, OVER MANAGEMENT\'S </p><p>FAILURE, SINCE LAST JANUARY, TO PAY MONTHLY PRODUCTION </p><p>BONUSES.  THE PAPER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WORKERS\' GRIEVANCES </p><p>AT THE DEFENSE PLANT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SECURITY OFFICIAL\'S CORROBORATION.  IN JUNE 24 MEETING </p><p>WITH PSO, ALEXANDRIA SECURITY OFFICIAL CONFIRMED THE </p><p>OCCURRENCE OF A STRIKE AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY OVER THE </p><p>NON-PAYMENT OF WORKERS\' BONUSES.  THE OFFICIAL PROVIDED </p><p>FEW DETAILS ON THE EVENT AND DOWNPLAYED ITS SIGNIFICANCE, </p><p>PORTRAYING IT AS A RARE AND ISOLATED CASE OF WORKERS </p><p>EXPRESSING THEIR UNHAPPINESS OVER A FACTORY-SPECIFIC, </p><p>BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUE.  THE SOURCE APPEARED TO IMPLY </p><p>THAT POLICE HAD INTERVENED TO HALT THE WORKERS\' PROTEST, </p><p>BUT WOULD NOT CONFIRM WHETHER THE INCIDENT HAD RESULTED </p><p>IN ANY ARRESTS OR INJURIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DEFENSE PLANT.  PERHAPS INDICATIVE OF EGYPTIANS\' </p><p>SENSITIVITY AND SECRECY REGARDING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY, </p><p>THE SECURITY OFFICIAL DENIED HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE </p><p>SECOND REPORTED INCIDENT, AT THE MOHARREM BEY FACTORY. </p><p>WHEN PSO MENTIONED AL-AHALI\'S STORY, THE OFFICIAL REMARKED </p><p>CALMLY "I DON\'T KNOW WHAT YOU\'RE TALKING ABOUT" AND THEN </p><p>CHANGED THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  AT THIS JUNCTURE, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH </p><p>CREDENCE TO GIVE TO AL-AHALI\'S REPORT OF LABOR TROUBLE AT </p><p>THE MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT.  WHILE THE PAPER\'S </p><p>REPORTING OFTEN LACKS OBJECTIVITY AND ACCURACY, LABOR </p><p>TROUBLE IN SUCH MILITARY-RUN (BUT CIVILIAN-MANNED) </p><p>FACTORIES IS NOT UNKNOWN; IN APRIL 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>VARIOUS SOURCES CONFIRMED THE OUTBREAK OF A STRIKE--BROKE </p><p>UP BY POLICE--AT A DEFENSE PLANT NEAR CAIRO.  IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THIS PRECEDENT, THE SECURITY OFFICIAL UNHESITATINGLY </p><p>CONFIRMED AL-AHALI\'S REPORT OF THE OTHER STRIKE, AT THE </p><p>ABU KIR SITE.  WE WILL PURSUE THE AL-AHALI STORY WITH OUR </p><p>CONTACTS AND REPORT FURTHER AS WARRANTED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COOK </p><p></p></div>
