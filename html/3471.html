<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004443 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2022 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, TU, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI, TURKISH FONMINS VISIT AMMAN:  FOCUS ON </p><p>IRAQ, BUT NO MOVEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>IRAQI FONMIN IN AMMAN... </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Iraqi FonMin Naji Sabri visited Amman August 6 and </p><p>met with King Abdullah, PM Ali Abul Ragheb, and FonMin Marwan </p><p>Muasher.  In an August 8 conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>Muasher said that Sabri was clearly concerned about what King </p><p>Abdullah had discussed regarding Iraq during the King\'s trip </p><p>to the U.S. last week -- although Sabri did not ask about the </p><p>King\'s discussions directly.  According to Muasher, the King </p><p>told Sabri that he was frustrated with Iraqi regime policy: </p><p>even though he has tried to give good advice to Iraq, the </p><p>regime never listens.  Muasher said that when the King told </p><p>Sabri that Iraq should immediately implement all applicable </p><p>UNSCRs, "we did not get any positive reaction."  Sabri </p><p>repeated his public line that Iraq is prepared to cooperate </p><p>with UN weapons inspectors, but only as part of an overall </p><p>deal involving the lifting of sanctions.  The King, Muasher </p><p>claimed, told Sabri that Iraq "can\'t dictate the conditions </p><p>-- don\'t you realize that?" </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  According to Muasher, Sabri also expressed concern </p><p>over former Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan\'s appearance at a </p><p>July conference of Iraqi oppositionists in London.  The King </p><p>reportedly told Sabri that he had not approved Hassan\'s </p><p>appearance and, in fact, had known nothing about it </p><p>beforehand. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>...AND THE TURK AS WELL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Turkish FonMin Sukru Sina Gurel also visited Amman </p><p>August 6 and met with King Abdullah, PM Abul Ragheb and </p><p>FonMin Muasher, as well as Iraqi FonMin Sabri.  Muasher told </p><p>the Ambassador that Gurel had wanted to discuss Jordan\'s </p><p>position on Iraq, but had provided little insight into </p><p>Turkish thinking.  However, Muasher commented, Gurel left the </p><p>impression -- but did not state explicitly -- that, in the </p><p>end, Turkey will "provide support" to possible U.S. military </p><p>action against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Turkish Charge Sadi Altinok (protect) claimed to the </p><p>DCM August 7 that FM Gurel was unaware that Iraqi FM Sabri </p><p>was in Amman until FM Muasher mentioned it in passing during </p><p>his meeting.  After the meeting with Muasher, Gurel decided </p><p>on his own to ask Sabri to meet.  According to the Turkish </p><p>charge, Gurel urged Iraq to comply with UNSCRs, and Sabri </p><p>restated the Iraqi position. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  According to Altinok, PM Abul Ragheb and Gurel in </p><p>their meeting had discussed scenarios for the "day after" a </p><p>possible military action against Iraq.  Both agreed the Iraqi </p><p>regime is bad for everybody, but worried that Iraq would </p><p>break apart in the wake of a war.  Abul Ragheb told Gurel </p><p>that removing the Ba\'ath party would leave Iraq without any </p><p>political glue, perhaps leading to disintegration of </p><p>authority and civil war. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>KING ABDULLAH SHIES AWAY FROM TURKISH PRESS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In an interesting side note, Altinok said that King </p><p>Abdullah had turned down a request to appear on Turkish state </p><p>television.  The palace said the King had been on TV quite a </p><p>lot lately and was cutting back on his exposure. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Sabri seems to have come to Amman both to check on </p><p>what King Abdullah did in Washington and to remind the </p><p>Jordanians that Iraq is watching Jordanian actions.  As </p><p>usual, the Jordanian-Iraqi exchange seems to have produced </p><p>little movement in any direction. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
