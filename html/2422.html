<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000242 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUJA\'S APPROACH TO THE DROC PEACE PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 ABUJA 2113 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: While cognizant of the complexities in the </p><p>DROC peace process, the GON nevertheless remains engaged and </p><p>appears more upbeat than last October when NSA Aliyu Mohammed </p><p>intimated Nigeria may extract itself from this diplomatic </p><p>morass(reftel) . However, Abuja did not walk, in part, </p><p>because it sees its role in the peace workout as evidence of </p><p>Nigeria\'s centrality to African diplomacy. The thrust of </p><p>Nigeria\'s efforts in DROC have been to cajole the Congolese </p><p>Big Three -) Kabila, Bemba and Onusumba -- toward agreement </p><p>on key issues such as the composition and duration of an </p><p>interim government, composition of the national army, a </p><p>cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from </p><p>Congolese soil. While supportive of the Inter-Congolese </p><p>Dialogue (ICD), Abuja\'s approach indicates that it sees </p><p>progress in the ICD as dependent on the Big Three reaching a </p><p>general understanding on these key issues.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During a recent meeting with PolCouns, Special </p><p>Presidential Advisor on Conflict Resolution Ambassador Ralph </p><p>Uwechue provided an account of the December 7, 2001 meeting </p><p>of representatives of the Big Three in Abuja.  Contrary to </p><p>public perception, the December meeting was not a product of </p><p>Abuja\'s insistence, the affable Uwechue maintained.  The </p><p>meeting came at the Big Three\'s behest.  Further, the </p><p>December session was actually "chaired" by the UN, with </p><p>Nigeria simply providing the venue.  That the three sides saw </p><p>Abuja as a neutral site and agreed to meet here reflected the </p><p>GON\'s progress in establishing itself as an honest-broker. </p><p>(Comment:  Uwechue likely massaged the truth a bit by stating </p><p>the GON did nothing to promote the meeting.  There had been </p><p>plenty of GON prodding of the major Congolese factions in the </p><p>weeks and months before the meeting.  Nevertheless, that the </p><p>three sides all felt relatively comfortable in coming to </p><p>Abuja is a point well taken.  End Comment.)  The tripartite </p><p>meeting resulted in a basic understanding on the procedures, </p><p>roster of invitees, and to a significant degree, the agenda </p><p>for the ICD set to resume in Sun City. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Uwechue mentioned the parties also discussed the </p><p>vexatious issues of interim government composition and </p><p>longevity, reconstruction of a national army, and the </p><p>presence of foreign interlopers on Congolese soil.  Uwechue </p><p>tried to dress this aspect of the meeting as neatly as </p><p>possible by claiming progress was made because no side </p><p>rejected the others\' recommendations outright.  Instead, they </p><p>all agreed to carry the others\' positions back to their </p><p>principals for further study.  Asked whether the lack of </p><p>acrimony represented actual progress or was just a display of </p><p>African etiquette not to spark a row when a guest in </p><p>another\'s home, Uwechue smiled, then admitted there was </p><p>substantial distance between the sides on these cardinal </p><p>political and military issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nonetheless, Uwechue asserted the December meeting had </p><p>been a net positive.  Before the delegates returned to their </p><p>respective camps, Obasanjo hosted a dinner.  During that </p><p>event, Obasanjo plied his special brand of diplomacy, </p><p>imploring each side to bridle personal ambition and </p><p>animosities in order to embrace compromise in the search for </p><p>something loftier -) national reconciliation and peace.  The </p><p>evening was pitched with emotion, recalled Uwechue. Delegates </p><p>from each side, voices crackling with strong emotion, </p><p>promised to honor the charge President Obasanjo had given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Using these examples as a segue, Uwechue extolled the </p><p>efficacy of Nigerian diplomacy in the Congo.  He discussed it </p><p>as labor intensive and centered on the Big Three.  Uwechue </p><p>stated that, in the context of African diplomacy, building </p><p>personal relationships was essential to success.  If a </p><p>protagonist considers you a friend he will listen and </p><p>consider proposals that he would reject if heard from a </p><p>stranger, claimed Uwechue. Moreover, the Congolese realized </p><p>that Nigeria had no vested national interests in the Congo </p><p>that would pollute its role as a honest-broker in the DROC. </p><p>Consequently, Uwechue asserted that President Obasanjo had </p><p>given him the mandate to build close relationships with the </p><p>Congolese trio.  The Special Envoy declared that he speaks to </p><p>the three, particularly Onusumba and Bemba, regularly by </p><p>phone.  Also, Uwechue recalled making numerous trips to the </p><p>Congo to see the players.  Because of the relationships he </p><p>and Obasanjo had established with the trio, Uwechue believed </p><p>that Nigeria could push the sides toward peace, inch by slow </p><p>inch.  However, Uwechue acknowledged this process would be </p><p>prolonged and time consuming.  He predicted progress in </p><p>increments with little chance of major leaps forward. </p><p>6. (C)  While defending the focus on faction heads, Uwechue </p><p>stated that Abuja supported the ICD.  Nigeria\'s efforts </p><p>should be seen as collaborative with, not undermining the </p><p>larger deliberative mechanism.  However, the reality of power </p><p>politics must be acknowledged, he stressed.  Notwithstanding </p><p>the numbers that might attend the ICD, the Big Three will </p><p>primarily determine the success or failure of the peace </p><p>process in the DROC.  If the Big Three agree on an issue, the </p><p>others will be hard pressed not to acquiesce.  If the three </p><p>major armed groups oppose an idea, there will be little the </p><p>other groups can do to make the trio reverse course.  Having </p><p>superior numbers of delegates around a conference table does </p><p>not alter the reality of the power equation on the ground, he </p><p>proffered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Regarding DROC\'s interfering neighbors, Uwechue </p><p>believed that Kagame was the most problematic.  Rwanda\'s role </p><p>in the Congo was a result of objective security concerns as </p><p>well as Kagame\'s increscent ambition.  Wanting to be a major </p><p>regional player, Kagame sought influence beyond Rwanda\'s </p><p>borders in any event.  The DROC morass, given the </p><p>FAR/Interahamwe presence, provided ample justification for </p><p>interference. Under the guise of self-defense, Kagame has </p><p>sated his ambition by an intervention in DROC that exceeds </p><p>Rwanda\'s legitimate security concerns.  Because of his </p><p>appetite for influence, the Rwandan was in no rush to alter </p><p>the status quo. Uwechue predicted Kagame would lean on his </p><p>clients, Bemba and Onusumba, to hew a hard-line instead of </p><p>encouraging them toward compromise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 8.  (C) Uwechue felt Uganda\'s Museveni was less of a problem </p><p>than the man in Kigali.  To a large degree, Museveni\'s </p><p>intrusion was derivative of Kagame\'s.  Museveni could not </p><p>idle and risk being overshadowed by Kagame in the contest for </p><p>regional influence.  In large measure, Museveni remained in </p><p>DROC to counterbalance his rival in Rwanda.  If Kagame can be </p><p>coaxed to the exit door, Museveni would follow with litle </p><p>difficulty, Uwechue believed.  Encouraging the disengagement </p><p>of both Kagame and Museveni were areas where Nigeria believed </p><p>the international community could best play a diplomatic </p><p>role, he stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In the lead-up to the Sun City ICD in late January, </p><p>the Special Advisor held out the possibility of a  Big Three </p><p>meeting hosted by President Obasanjo in Abuja.  During a </p><p>January 11 talk with Emboff, Lt. Col. Idris, Special </p><p>Assistant to the NSA and Lawal Hamadu of the NSA\'s Office, </p><p>confirmed that the GON might call a meeting of the Big Three </p><p>prior to the scheduled resumption of the ICD in late January. </p><p> Hamadu added that the ICD would again feature well over 300 </p><p>delegates, and that the Mai Mai would attend but would attach </p><p>itself to a pre-existing ICD delegation and not go to the ICD </p><p>as a separate delegation.  However, he added, that the </p><p>facilitator was scrambling to find money to pay for </p><p>conference expenses, such as transportation costs, that the </p><p>South Africans were not paying.  (South Africa will absorb </p><p>the lodging and associated expenses.)  Due to funding </p><p>questions, Hamadu predicted that commencement of the ICD </p><p>session in Sun City would be delayed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  While supportive of the ICD, Abuja has focussed on </p><p>the leaders of the three armed groups. This implies a </p><p>decision that the ICD, given the financial, logistical, and </p><p>substantive challenges resulting from its large composition, </p><p>is an all too unwieldy and infrequent by deliberative </p><p>mechanism to tackle the most sensitive issues in the peace </p><p>process.  Abuja believes establishing close personal rapport </p><p>with the three key leaders is the sine qua non to significant </p><p>progress on a cease-fire, agreement on the transition </p><p>government and on reconstructing the army.  Consequently, </p><p>Abuja will continue to work the Big Three.  Although the </p><p>Nigerians have not clearly articulated this, they apparently </p><p>believe this spadework with the Big Three actually </p><p>complements the ICD by forging progress in areas extremely </p><p>difficult for the ICD to handle.  Under this informal </p><p>division of labor, Nigeria seemingly hopes the ICD will not </p><p>get bogged down in dealing with the "demilitarization" phase </p><p>of peace and will focus on issues that come up later, such as </p><p>elections and democratization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  The danger exists that Nigeria\'s approach could be </p><p>perceived as creating a second negotiating track capable of </p><p>undermining the ICD or, worst, of presenting a potential </p><p>understanding among the Big Three as a fait accompli to the </p><p>ICD.  While the danger exits, we think believe the Nigerians </p><p>are cognizant of the potential jeopardy and will take pains </p><p>to make sure it does not happen. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
