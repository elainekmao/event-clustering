<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/EPPD/PD </p><p>PASS USTR FOR PADILLA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, IT, KPAO, TBIO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: WTO BIOTECH PUBLIC DIPLOMACY IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 21881 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00398  311845Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: EMIL SKODON, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (D) AND (E). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) PA ITALY HAS FOCUSED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES ON </p><p>BIOTECH ISSUES OVER THE PAST YEAR, SPONSORING SPEAKER </p><p>PROGRAMS, DVCS, ROUNDTABLES, SEMINARS, INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROJECTS, PRESS INTERVIEWS, OP-ED PIECES, </p><p>AND OTHER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE </p><p>U.S. BIOTECH INTERESTS IN ITALY.  THIS IS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST </p><p>PRIORITIES, AND WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRANSMITTING OUR </p><p>MESSAGE TO ITALIAN POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT CRISIS IN </p><p>IRAQ, IT WILL BE UNTIMELY TO MOUNT A HIGH PROFILE PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN IN ITALY TO PROMOTE A WTO CASE AGAINST THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION OVER ITS MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS OF BIOTECH </p><p>FOOD PRODUCTS.  THE BULK OF OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT IN </p><p>THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME MUST FOCUS ON PROMOTING U.S. </p><p>POLICY IN IRAQ AND GAINING ITALIAN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR IT.  WE </p><p>ARE CONCERNED THAT IF WE ARE ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME THAT WE ARE PUBLICLY PROMOTING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST </p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER BIOTECH FOOD PRODUCTS (A VERY </p><p>SENSITIVE ISSUE IN ITALY), WE COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO </p><p>INCREASE ITALIAN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR OUR ACTIONS IN IRAQ. </p><p>WHILE U.S. IRAQ POLICY AND U.S. BIOTECH FOOD POLICY ARE NOT </p><p>LOGICALLY RELATED, OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE ITALIAN PRESS </p><p>AND PUBLIC WILL MAKE A CONNECTION THAT COULD BE TO THE </p><p>DETRIMENT OF OUR EFFORTS AT THIS CRITICAL TIME.  WE SHOULD </p><p>SEEK TO SLAY ONLY ONE DRAGON AT A TIME. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00398  311845Z </p><p>3.  (C) WE SHOULD THEREFORE PROCEED INCREMENTALLY IN OUR </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO SUPPORT THE USG CASE IN THE WTO </p><p>AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER THE MORATORIUM; WE SHOULD </p><p>TARGET SPECIFIC POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION LEADERS FIRST, </p><p>RATHER THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN FOR SUCH A TARGETED AUDIENCE WOULD FOCUS </p><p>AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE ON THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE USG CASE, </p><p>I.E., ON THE ILLEGAL NATURE OF THE MORATORIUM.  THUS THE </p><p>FIRST TWO OF THE SEVEN BROAD MESSAGES OUTLINED IN REFTEL </p><p>WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL IN ITALY IN THE NEAR TERM: THAT THE </p><p>MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS OF BIOTECH FOOD PRODUCTS VIOLATES </p><p>COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE EU IN THE WTO; AND THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>SIMPLY SEEKING SCIENTIFIC, RULES-BASED REVIEW OF </p><p>APPLICATIONS, NOT FORCING ACCEPTANCE OF BIOTECH FOODS ON </p><p>EUROPEAN CONSUMERS.  WE KNOW ITALIAN POLICY MAKERS AND </p><p>OPINION LEADERS ("VALIDATORS") WHO WOULD SUPPORT US IN THESE </p><p>ARGUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE REMAINING FIVE BROAD MESSAGES (PARAGRAPH 3C-G IN </p><p>REFTEL), FOCUSING ON WHAT SOME ITALIAN OPINION LEADERS REGARD </p><p>AS SUBSIDIARY ISSUES, WOULD BE MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE WITH THAT </p><p>AUDIENCE.  WE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ITALIAN "VALIDATORS" TO SUPPORT THEM AND WE ARE THEREFORE </p><p>INCLINED TO USE THEM SPARINGLY IN OUR TARGETED PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN.  WHEN THE HEAT IS OFF THE IRAQ CRISIS AND </p><p>WE CAN USEFULLY RESUME A BROADER-BASED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p>CAMPAIGN, ISSUE C (FAMINE IN AFRICA) HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE </p><p>WITH ITALIAN POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE PUBLIC.  PM BERLUSCONI </p><p>HAS EXPRESSED PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS THEME TO OUR </p><p>AMBASSADORS TO ITALY, THE VATICAN, AND THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00398  311845Z </p><p>5.  (U) WE ARE CURRENTLY IDENTIFYING ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>FOR A BIOTECH VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROGRAM AND WOULD WELCOME </p><p>FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $25,000 TO ALLOW </p><p>TEN PARLIAMENTARIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.  WE WILL </p><p>ALSO ORGANIZE WITHIN TWO MONTHS U.S. SPEAKER PROGRAMS IN </p><p>MILAN, NAPLES, AND ROME IN SUPPORT OF U.S. BIOTECH POLICY. </p><p>WE WOULD EAGERLY ACCEPT DVCS WITH HIGH-LEVEL USG OFFICIALS </p><p>(SUCH AS USTR ZOELLICK AND U/S LARSON) AS SOON AS A DECISION </p><p>IS MADE TO PROCEED WITH THE WTO CASE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00398 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
