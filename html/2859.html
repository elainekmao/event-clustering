Under headline "Sharon\'s war crimes" the ruling </p><p>   ZANU PF weekly mouthpiece "The People\'s Voice" </p><p>   dedicated its May 11 editorial to calling on President </p><p>   George W.

"The Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Sharon, has a </p><p>   number of mass graves behind him.  In 1982, he </p><p>   massacred many Palestinians in Lebanon.  Some </p><p>   punishment should have been meted out to him then. </p><p>   Now, he has repeated the same story in Jenin. . .  The </p><p>   War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague should order the </p><p>   public trial of Mr. Sharon for the massacre of </p><p>   Palestinian refugees at Jenin. . .  The American </p><p>   President, George W.
