(C) SUMMARY: EDWARD CHINDORI-CHININGA, DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM AND ZANU-PF MEMBER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT, PAID A CALL ON AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON </p><p>OCTOBER 30 TO INFORM HIM OF HIS MINISTRY\'S PLANS TO </p><p>IMPROVE PROTECTION OF WILDLIFE, RESOLVE THE OCCUPATIONS </p><p>OF CONSERVANCY LANDS, AND REACH AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>NEIGHBORING STATES ON THE JOINT MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL </p><p>PARKS THAT CROSS BORDERS.  CHINDORI-CHININGA </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS MINISTRY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>PREVENT POACHING OF WILDLIFE ON OCCUPIED LANDS.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED HIS OFFICE HAS DEVELOPED A PLAN FOR RESOLVING </p><p>OCCUPATIONS OF LANDS DESIGNATED AS NATURE CONSERVANCIES, </p><p>BUT POLITICAL CORRUPTION IS AFFECTING THIS PROCESS. </p><p>TALKS BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND ITS NEIGHBORS FOR JOINT </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF PARK LANDS THAT SHARE COMMON BORDERS IS </p><p>MOVING FORWARD, AND A TREATY IS READY TO BE PRESENTED TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT FOR THE JOINT MANAGEMENT OF A NATIONAL PARK </p><p>AREA THAT ZIMBABWE SHARES WITH MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA.  FINALLY, PRESIDENT MUGABE IS SO OBSESSED WITH </p><p>THE LAND QUESTION, THAT NONE OF THESE ISSUES ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06126  01 OF 02  311720Z </p><p>IMPORTANT TO HIM, ACCORDING TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>A MINISTRY UNABLE TO PREVENT RAMPANT POACHING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHINDORI-CHININGA ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>POACHING ACROSS ZIMBABWE, ON COMMERCIAL FARMS AS WELL AS </p><p>NATURE CONSERVANCIES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND LANDLESS PEOPLE SINCE FEBRUARY.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER\'S ASSERTION CONFIRMS THE NUMEROUS PRESS REPORTS </p><p>AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION UPDATES THAT HAVE DETAILED </p><p>THIS PROBLEM.  HE STATED THAT HIS MINISTRY\'S SCOUTS, WHO </p><p>HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONTROLLED POACHING OF WILDLIFE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING THIS THROUGH </p><p>INTIMIDATION, THREAT OF VIOLENCE, AND IN A FEW CASES, </p><p>PHYSICAL ASSAULT BY WAR VETERANS.  A JOINT COMMAND OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE MILITARY AND POLICE ARE NOW BEING USED TO </p><p>ATTEMPT TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE POACHING SITUATION.  HE </p><p>BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON A LACK OF COMMUNICATION, ARISING </p><p>FROM THE FACT THAT HIS MINISTRY HAD NOT MET WITH </p><p>OCCUPIERS TO ESTABLISH THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH HIS </p><p>SCOUTS COULD SAFELY PATROL OCCUPIED LANDS TO </p><p>PREVENT/CONTROL POACHING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>A SOLUTION FOR THE OCCUPIED CONSERVANCIES? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND TOURISM MINISTRY IS WORKING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06126  01 OF 02  311720Z </p><p>ON A PLAN FOR RESOLVING THE OCCUPATION OF LANDS </p><p>DESIGNATED AS NATURE CONSERVANCIES TO WHICH, HE CLAIMS, </p><p>THE CABINET HAS AGREED.  THIS PLAN INVOLVES SECURING THE </p><p>AGREEMENT OF PRIVATE CONSERVANCY LANDOWNERS TO ALLOW THE </p><p>RESIDENTS OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THAT BORDER THESE </p><p>CONSERVANCIES TO BUY INTO THE OPERATION OF THESE AREAS, </p><p>SO THEY MAY BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE TOURISM TRADE THEY </p><p>GENERATE.  THE DETAILS OF SUCH A PLAN, INCLUDING </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP, FINANCING, AND THE JOINT </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONSERVANCIES, WITH THEIR PRIVATELY </p><p>OWNED LAND, GOVERNMENT OWNED LAND, AND INDIGENOUS </p><p>COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION, WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A </p><p>WORKSHOP THAT THE MINISTRY IS PLANNING.  HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>TWO PROBLEMS: WHERE TO MOVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OCCUPIED </p><p>THESE LANDS; AND HOW TO FEND OFF THE POLITICIANS WHO </p><p>WILL SEEK A CUT IN SUCH DEALS.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CASE OF THE SAVE </p><p>CONSERVANCY AND RUMORS THAT JOSIAH HUNGWE, THE GOVERNOR </p><p>OF THE MASVINGO PROVINCE, WHERE THIS CONSERVANCY IS </p><p>LOCATED, IS INSISTING ON GETTING A PIECE OF THE ACTION. </p><p>CHINDORI-CHININGA CONFIRMED THAT HE HAS ALSO HEARD SUCH </p><p>RUMORS ABOUT HUNGWE, AND THAT THIS COULD PROVE A </p><p>HINDRANCE TO RESOLVING THE SAVE CONSERVANCY SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>TRANSFRONTIER MANAGEMENT OF PARKS CLOSE TO REALITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6252 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06126  02 OF 02  311721Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------98FCCA  311729Z /38 </p><p>P 311718Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7489 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006126 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>PASS DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR FOR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06126  02 OF 02  311721Z </p><p>SERVICE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SENV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DEPUTY ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM MINISTER BRIEFS </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON PLANS TO PROTECT WILDLIFE AND RESOLVE </p><p>CONSERVANCY LAND OCCUPATIONS </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE DEPUTY MINISTER STATED THAT ZIMBABWE, </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, AND SOUTH AFRICA HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON A </p><p>PLAN TO MANAGE JOINTLY THE AREA THAT CONSISTS OF THE </p><p>GONAREZHOU NATIONAL PARK IN ZIMBABWE, THE COUTADO 16 </p><p>NATIONAL PARK IN MOZAMBIQUE, AND THE KRUGER NATIONAL </p><p>PARK IN SOUTH AFRICA.  THIS AGREEMENT WOULD SOON BE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE ZIMBABWEAN PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL.  HE </p><p>ALSO REPORTED THERE IS PROGRESS TOWARDS AGREEMENTS </p><p>BETWEEN/AMONG ZIMBABWE, BOTSWANA, NAMIBIA, ZAMBIA, AND </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE FOR THE JOINT MANAGEMENT OF OTHER NATIONAL </p><p>PARKS THAT SHARE BOUNDARIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>NONE OF THIS INTERESTS MUGABE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE DEPUTY MINISTER WAS ASKED IF, GIVEN THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF TOURISM AS A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNER FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND THE PAST HISTORY OF ZIMBABWE HAVING A </p><p>REPUTATION AS A COUNTRY THAT PROTECTED ITS WILDLIFE AND </p><p>NATURAL AREAS, PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS INTERESTED IN THESE </p><p>ISSUES.  WITHOUT SAYING SO EXPLICITLY, CHINDORI-CHININGA </p><p>IMPLIED THAT MUGABE NOW HAS NO REAL INTEREST IN THESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06126  02 OF 02  311721Z </p><p>ISSUES.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT HE RECENTLY </p><p>MET WITH MUGABE TO DISCUSS THESE ASPECTS OF HIS </p><p>PORTFOLIO, AND WHILE MUGABE WOULD PAY ATTENTION AS HE </p><p>SPOKE, WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR MUGABE TO TALK, HIS </p><p>COMMENTS INVARIABLY RETURNED TO THE ISSUE OF LAND FOR </p><p>THE LANDLESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LAND CASES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS </p><p>MEETING TO RAISE THE SPECIFIC CASES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS </p><p>RESIDENT IN ZIMBABWE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LANDS LISTED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ).  IT WAS POINTED OUT TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER THAT </p><p>ALL OF THESE CASES INVOLVE LANDS THAT WERE PURCHASED BY </p><p>THE AMERICAN CITIZENS IN ORDER TO PURSUE NATURE </p><p>CONSERVATION AND TOURISM.  IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO </p><p>CHINDORI-CHININGA THAT IF THESE LANDS ARE EVENTUALLY </p><p>FORCIBLY ACQUIRED BY THE GOZ WITHOUT APPROPRIATE </p><p>COMPENSATION, IT WOULD HAVE A REAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON </p><p>U.S.-ZIMBABWE RELATIONS.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER PROMISED </p><p>HE WOULD LOOK INTO THESE CASES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: WHILE THE DEPUTY MININSTER\'S COMMENTS </p><p>WERE GENERALLY IN A POSITIVE VEIN REGARDING STEPS THAT </p><p>THE GOZ SHOULD CLEARLY TAKE ON THE ISSUES DISCUSSED, THE </p><p>ACTIONS THAT THE GOZ TAKES WILL BE WHAT COUNT.  WHILE HE </p><p>IS AN UP-AND-COMING ZANU-PF POLITICIAN WITH POLITICAL </p><p>ACUMEN, THE DEPUTY MINISTER ALSO HAS UNCLEAN HANDS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06126  02 OF 02  311721Z </p><p>POST HAS HEARD CREDIBLE ACCOUNTS THAT CHINDORI-CHININGA </p><p>WAS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN HIS HOME AREA IN THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE THUS SHARES BLAME FOR </p><p>THE MINDLESS POACHING OF WILDLIFE, CUTTING OF TREES, AND </p><p>SETTING OF FIRES THAT HAS OCCURRED ON ZIMBABWE\'S PRIVATE </p><p>NATURE CONSERVANCIES, RANCHES, AND COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
