<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: DR. QUE UNDER DETENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Poloff visited the home of democracy activist Dr. </p><p>Nguyen Dan Que on March 18 to confirm reports of his arrest </p><p>received earlier that day.  Based on the information originally </p><p>provided by his brother in the U.S., and now confirmed by his </p><p>wife, it appears that a large number of security officers hustled </p><p>Dr. Que off to the local District 5 police station at 8:00 p.m. on </p><p>March 17.  He was arrested in front of his home, without being </p><p>given an opportunity to go inside and retrieve additional clothing </p><p>or medications.  The arresting officers on the scene accused him </p><p>of being on his way to an Internet cafe to publish criticisms of </p><p>the GVN.  Police returned to Que\'s home in force just before </p><p>midnight the same day to search through his possessions.  They </p><p>removed his computer and cell phone, as well as assorted documents </p><p>and written materials.  Several officers took still photographs </p><p>and video footage during the search. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The long, unlit alley leading to Dr. Que\'s home </p><p>appeared largely deserted when Poloff arrived at 7:30 p.m. on </p><p>March 18.  Dr. Que\'s wife opened the door only long enough to </p><p>quickly usher Poloff inside.  She appeared quite nervous and </p><p>agitated throughout the conversation.  At one point, she sent a </p><p>relative out to photocopy the investigation report signed by the </p><p>police and family members upon completion of the search.  Post now </p><p>has a copy of that report.  Dr. Que\'s stepson had been brought to </p><p>the police station at 1:30 a.m. that morning to sign the report </p><p>and to obtain a legal record of what had been taken from his home. </p><p>Dr. Que\'s brother surmised that Dr. Que must have </p><p>characteristically insisted on the police producing a legal </p><p>document to entitle them to search.  Fortunately, the stepson was </p><p>able to see Dr. Que at the time he signed the document.  Police </p><p>later informed Dr. Que\'s wife that her husband had been moved to </p><p>the municipal jail in District 1, and allowed her to send clothing </p><p>and medicine.  Dr. Que\'s wife did not know why the authorities had </p><p>decided to detain her husband at this time.  She speculated that </p><p>it must have had something to do with one of his interviews with </p><p>the foreign news media, including Radio Free Asia.  His brother </p><p>thought it might have something to do with Dr. Que\'s recent </p><p>criticism of GVN claims of a free press in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  During the conversation, Dr. Que\'s wife made clear that </p><p>she and her husband would appreciate any representations by the </p><p>Consulate General, in the hopes of gaining his release or </p><p>improving his treatment.  She expressed concern that he had not </p><p>been feeling very well before this latest incident.  (Post note: </p><p>Dr. Que is an endocrinologist and has been self-medicating an </p><p>ulcer and kidney ailments for a long time.  His brother sends him </p><p>medication from the U.S. from time to time.  End note.)  Post will </p><p>follow up with the relevant local authorities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Dr. Que and his family have occasionally </p><p>raised exaggerated alarm bells in the past, but this incident </p><p>would seem to be the real thing.  Just why the GVN would choose to </p><p>raise the stakes with a well-known figure like Dr. Que at this </p><p>time is not clear, given that he has been consistently outspoken </p><p>in his views over a period of time.  It may be as simple (naive?) </p><p>as his brother\'s assumption that hardliners in the GVN hope the </p><p>USG would be otherwise distracted by events in Iraq. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
