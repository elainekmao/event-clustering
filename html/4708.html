HIZBULLAH DEFENDANTS CONVICTED </p><p>(Bolge)  The State Security Court convicted six </p><p>Hizbullah defendants for membership in and </p><p>support to the illegal organization.  Five of the </p><p>defendants were sentenced to prison terms of 12 </p><p>years and nine months (for membership) and the </p><p>remaining one to three years and nine months (for </p><p>support).

PKK SUSPECTS ACQUITTED </p><p>(Bolge)  The Adana State Security Court acquitted </p><p>Ismail and Hikmet Ocas, father and son, </p><p>respectively, who had been arrested during an </p><p>early-October anti-PKK operation in Ceyhan </p><p>(Adana), in their first trial.  The defendants </p><p>had been charged with provision of support and </p><p>shelter to the PKK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANOTHER EIGHT DEFENDANTS RELEASED IN MERSIN </p><p>NEWROZ CASE </p><p>(Bolge)  The trial of another 16 of the 148 </p><p>defendants charged with "illegal demonstration," </p><p>"pro-PKK slogans" and "assault against security </p><p>forces" during the unauthorized Newroz </p><p>celebrations in Mersin continued in the Adana </p><p>State Security Court on December 11.  Eight </p><p>defendants who were being tried in custody </p><p>appeared for the trial, denied the charges </p><p>against them and requested their release.  Their </p><p>attorneys also claimed their clients were not at </p><p>the scene to participate in the celebrations. </p><p>The court then ordered the release of these </p><p>defendants and adjourned the trial until a later </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PKK COURIER </p><p>(Bolge)  Izmir Security Directorate Anti-terror </p><p>Squad police arrested PKK courier Rojda Erdogan, </p><p>for whom police had been searching because she </p><p>was sending PKK sympathizers in Istanbul and </p><p>Izmir to rural areas.  Police determined Rojda </p><p>had recently sent two people from Istanbul to </p><p>rural Kiziltepe (Mardin).  Rojda was arraigned in </p><p>a local court where she was ordered to remain in </p><p>custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  RETURNEES </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Evrensel)  Nearly three months ago, </p><p>200 evacuees returned to Mazidagi\'s (Mardin) </p><p>Yalinagac village under the Village Return </p><p>Project.  The village was evacuated in 1993 due </p><p>to terror incidents.  The Mardin Governor\'s </p><p>Office provided the returnees with construction </p><p>materials to repair their homes.  Due to the </p><p>shortage of construction materials, two families </p><p>were unable to repair their homes and settled in </p><p>the village school, which had been closed due to </p><p>a lack of teachers. </p><p>7.  PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATION </p><p>(Evrensel)  In Batman, Democratic People\'s </p><p>Initiative organized a December 10 demonstration </p><p>to protest the isolation of PKK (KADEK) leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan in which lights were turned off </p><p>in homes for ten minutes.  Youths later gathered </p><p>in several districts of the province, lighting </p><p>fires and shouting pro-Ocalan slogans.  In </p><p>Diyarbakir, hundreds of people burned tires and </p><p>shouted slogans in support of Ocalan.  They also </p><p>marched, carrying Ocalan posters and KADEK flags. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  RADIO DUNYA OFFICIAL ACQUITTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Adana State Security Court </p><p>acquitted (Adana\'s) Radio Dunya General </p><p>Broadcasting Director Sabri Ejder, charged with </p><p>"inciting the public to hatred through appeals to </p><p>racial discrimination" during an April (radio) </p><p>program entitled "How can the Palestinian clash </p><p>be solved?"  The acquittal came when it was found </p><p>out the person who spoke on the cassette turned </p><p>out to be someone other than Ejder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  LANDMINE VICTIM\'S GRIEVANCE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Pervari (Siirt) shepherd Sabri Tunc, </p><p>who lost his hands in 1996 when a landmine he had </p><p>found while grazing his animals exploded in his </p><p>hands, claimed he had been prevented from </p><p>receiving food assistance provided by the Pervari </p><p>Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation </p><p>(SYDV), an affiliate of the District Governor\'s </p><p>Office, because of his membership in the </p><p>Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP).  Security </p><p>officers reportedly prevented Tunc from meeting </p><p>with the District Governor during the month of </p><p>Ramadan, when SYDV distributed food products to </p><p>poor people.  Tunc, who is unemployed, alleged </p><p>the District Governor\'s Office had sent him a </p><p>letter stating he was not in need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  GAP REGION PUBLIC HEALTH PROJECT </p><p>(Turkiye)  A survey carried out by Diyarbakir\'s </p><p>Dicle University in 1,186 homes in nine provinces </p><p>in the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) region </p><p>showed 68% of homes in rural areas did not have </p><p>toilets, 47% did not have bathrooms and 70% of </p><p>residents were parasite carriers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  VAN SCHOOLS CLOSED </p><p>(Evrensel)  According to the Van Health </p><p>Directorate, schools in that province were closed </p><p>for another three days due to a respiratory </p><p>system epidemic.  The schools were previously </p><p>closed for two days for the same reason. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  KILIS GOVERNOR SEEKS SUPPORT FOR OPEN-AIR </p><p>MARKET </p><p>(Turkiye)  Kilis Governor Kutuk Aslan has left </p><p>for Ankara to meet with several ministers to ask </p><p>for support to the proposed open-air market at </p><p>the Oncupinar border gate with Syria.  Kilis </p><p>expects a substantial contribution to the Kilis </p><p>and the Turkish economies as a result of this </p><p>market and transit passages through the border </p><p>gate. </p><p>13.  TPAO FINDS NATURAL GAS IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Turkiye)  During oil explorations in Silvan\'s </p><p>(Diyarbakir) Ozluce village, the Turkish </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) found natural gas 25 </p><p>meters away from a well from which 300 barrels of </p><p>oil are extracted daily.  As there is no natural </p><p>gas facility in the area, the gas is burning 24 </p><p>hours, posing a threat. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
