<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR J. FRASER </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BUHARI\'S MOVEMENTS NOT RESTRICTED; </p><p>BUT CAMPAIGN RALLIES WERE CANCELLED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  On April 30, there was confusion </p><p>whether ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari </p><p>had been restricted to his house in Daura, Katsina </p><p>State.  Buhari\'s supporters asserted that he had been </p><p>placed under de facto house arrest.  GON officials </p><p>disavowed the claim, stating that Buhari had only been </p><p>stopped from holding political rallies because his </p><p>party had refused to get the required permits.  ANPP </p><p>members claim they had the necessary permits. </p><p>Definitely, Buhari was not placed under arrest. </p><p>However, the rumors of his arrest and the cancellation </p><p>of the political rallies only add to the political </p><p>tension, particularly in northern Nigeria.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The BBC Hausa radio service reported early </p><p>on April 29 that ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari had been restricted to his residence.  The </p><p>Katsina State Police Commissioner reportedly told the </p><p>Katsina ANPP Chairman that Buhari was restricted to </p><p>his house "on orders."  In an afternoon broadcast, the </p><p>Press Officer for the Katsina State Police Command </p><p>told the BBC that the restriction was not on Buhari </p><p>but on political activity.  "All political rallies in </p><p>Katsina State have been cancelled due to security </p><p>reasons," he said on the air. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  According to a contact in the Buhari campaign </p><p>press office, Buhari was told "not to leave his house </p><p>on orders from the Presidency."  This contact said </p><p>that Buhari had scheduled a full slate of rallies for </p><p>that week to encourage ANPP supporters not to boycott </p><p>the May 3 State Assembly elections.  "If we prevail at </p><p>the tribunals, we want State Assemblies supportive of </p><p>our winning candidates," he said.  (COMMENT:  This </p><p>comment cannot be taken at face value.  A Buhari </p><p>campaign official would want to make Obasanjo look the </p><p>part of the undemocratic heavy.  Making people believe </p><p>that Obasanjo ordered Buhari\'s house arrest would be a </p><p>fine way of accomplishing this feat.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A flag officer at the Ministry of Defense </p><p>told Poloff that President Obasanjo had ordered the </p><p>military to arrest Buhari.  According to the source, </p><p>Obasanjo had been encouraged by "hawks" within the </p><p>Presidency, who told him, "no one reacted when Abacha </p><p>had you arrested."  The source said that Director of </p><p>Military Intelligence Maj. Gen. Williams Ajibade sent </p><p>a memo to the Chief of Army Staff advising him that </p><p>the military should remain neutral, describing the </p><p>dispute as "political" and an "issue for the police." </p><p>After the COAS showed the memo to Obasanjo, Ajibade </p><p>was immediately reassigned to the National Institute </p><p>for Policy and Strategic Studies.   Source claimed </p><p>that Obasanjo had "rethought" Buhari\'s arrest and now </p><p>realized that the move would have been counter- </p><p>productive.  This same account was repeated to Poloff </p><p>by a mid-level member of the President\'s staff and, </p><p>subsequently, by a retired military officer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Buhari had been scheduled to hold rallies in </p><p>Funtua (Katsina State) on April 28 and Zaria (Kaduna </p><p>State) and Katsina Ala (Benue State) on April 29.  He </p><p>had reportedly scheduled other rallies on April 30. </p><p>The ANPP claims that all rallies were scheduled in </p><p>advance and that the police had issued appropriate </p><p>permits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Contacts in the Funtua LGA told Emboffs that </p><p>ANPP party leaders in Funtua had been arrested on </p><p>April 28 and Buhari was advised not to travel as </p><p>"there would be no rally."  According to an Emirate </p><p>source, ANPP leaders in Zaria were informed by </p><p>security services that the scheduled April 29 rally </p><p>would not be allowed to take place and Buhari would </p><p>not be able to visit Zaria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The rendition of events given by the GON was </p><p>starkly different from what ANPP members told us. </p><p>Director General of State Security Service Kayode Are </p><p>told the Ambassador that Buhari was never restricted </p><p>to his house and that his freedom of movement had not </p><p>been abridged.  However, the police stopped the ANPP </p><p>from conducting a political rally because the party </p><p>had not applied for the required permit.  Are said </p><p>that the permit would be granted if the party applied. </p><p>He added further that ANPP supporters were being </p><p>purposefully confrontational by attempting to stage </p><p>the rally without a permit. ANPP stalwarts were hoping </p><p>to provoke a response from the police that would </p><p>escalate political tension, Are asserted.  However, </p><p>the police had been cautioned to exercise restraint. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  In a meeting with DCM, ANPP National Chairman </p><p>Don Etiebet also contradicted earlier statements made </p><p>by his party members.  Confirming Are\'s statement, </p><p>Etiebet summarily dismissed the claim that Buhari had </p><p>been restricted to his house. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  While observing the May 3 elections in </p><p>Katsina State May 3, Poloff drove past Buhari\'s Daura </p><p>residence.  About 20 policemen and 10-15 military </p><p>personnel were in front of the residence, but the </p><p>gates were open and people appeared to be coming and </p><p>going freely.  According to the ANPP chairman in </p><p>Katsina, Buhari had visited Funtua and Katsina just </p><p>prior to elections, but no rallies were held. </p><p>(Comment: As an ex-Head of State, Buhari has a </p><p>security detail, which was probably beefed up when he </p><p>entered the race for the Presidency.  Moreover, </p><p>Katsina was one of the Northern States where the GON </p><p>expected trouble. End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  One event, two vastly different </p><p>versions of what happened.  In a nutshell, Buhari was </p><p>not restricted to his residence but political rallies </p><p>were cancelled.  We seriously doubt that the </p><p>government would be foolish enough to arrest Buhari. </p><p>In the end, this episode was a tempest in a teapot; </p><p>however, some ANPP members sought to make it a storm. </p><p>Nevertheless, the police were being formalistic and </p><p>probably did not act with much aplomb when canceling </p><p>the campaign rallies.  While this incident eventually </p><p>fizzled out, anxiety remains high and we expect more </p><p>such rumors and intense moments, before the May 29 </p><p>Presidential inauguration. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
