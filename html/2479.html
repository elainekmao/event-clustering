<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: NP, PGOV, SOCI, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI PARLIAMENT CONVENES FOR WINTER SESSION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) KATHMANDU 0184; (B) KATHMANDU 2503; </p><p> </p><p>(C) 01 KATHMANDU 2302 </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The Winter Session of Parliament convened Feb. </p><p>10 amid widespread expectations that the Lower House </p><p>will ratify the state of national emergency declared </p><p>November 26, allowing its continuation for another three </p><p>months.  A vote on the emergency must take place before </p><p>Feb. 22.  Preoccupation with the emergency--and </p><p>political grandstanding against Prime Minister Deuba\'s </p><p>handling of the Maoist insurgency--may put off </p><p>consideration of a number of important pieces of </p><p>legislation left pending from last year\'s Winter </p><p>Session, including a long-awaited anti-corruption bill. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>WINTER SESSION TO TAKE UP EMERGENCY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The Winter Session of Parliament that convened </p><p>Feb. 10 faces a particularly busy schedule.  First on </p><p>the docket of the two-month session, MPs will have to </p><p>address whether or not to ratify the state of national </p><p>emergency declared November 26 by King Gyanendra after a </p><p>series of violent Maoist attacks that unilaterally broke </p><p>a four-month ceasefire.  At least two-thirds of the MPs </p><p>in the Lower House must vote by Feb. 22 in favor of the </p><p>emergency for it to continue for an additional three </p><p>months.  (Note:  At the end of those additional three </p><p>months, Parliament may then vote to extend the emergency </p><p>for an another six months.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Deuba, whose Nepali Congress Party holds 113 </p><p>seats in the 205-seat Lower House, will need the support </p><p>of the Communist Party of Nepal United Marxist-Leninist </p><p>(UML), which holds 69 seats, to get the two-thirds </p><p>majority necessary to uphold the emergency.  In spite of </p><p>occasional public sniping from the larger Opposition </p><p>parties--and an apparent ongoing sub rosa campaign to </p><p>oust Prime Minister Deuba by his own Party President and </p><p>long-time rival G. P. Koirala (Ref B)--most observers </p><p>expect Deuba will ultimately get the votes he needs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  In his opening address to the new Session, </p><p>Deuba asserted that although security forces have made </p><p>significant progress since November 26 in combating the </p><p>insurgency, more time is needed. He urged the MPs to </p><p>ratify the emergency for another three months.  The </p><p>immediate task is to disarm the Maoists, he said; only </p><p>then might the resumption of talks with the insurgents </p><p>be possible. Response from the Opposition was generally </p><p>noncommittal, although UML Leader Madhav Nepal offered </p><p>vague indications of support under certain, generally </p><p>unlikely conditions, including the amendment of the </p><p>Constitution to allow a national government.  Leaders of </p><p>the three small left-wing parties, which together </p><p>command a total of eight seats in the Lower House, </p><p>confirmed, on the other hand, that their parties will </p><p>not ratify the emergency. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Of perhaps even greater concern to the PM than </p><p>garnering the Opposition\'s support may be rumblings from </p><p>within his own Nepali Congress Party leadership. </p><p>Reports persist that supporters of former PM and Party </p><p>President G.P. Koirala have launched a petition campaign </p><p>calling for Deuba\'s resignation.  One "Koirala camp" MP, </p><p>while stopping short of confirming the rumor, recently </p><p>assured poloff vehemently that support for Deuba within </p><p>the party--and for ratification of the emergency--is </p><p>rapidly eroding.  But Ram Chandra Poudel, a Nepali </p><p>Congress Central Committee member and former Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister under Koirala, told poloff he suspects </p><p>reports of surging support for Koirala are wildly </p><p>exaggerated, primarily by none other than Koirala </p><p>himself.  Instead, Poudel said his own discussions with </p><p>Nepali Congress MPs reveal that most view any move to </p><p>dump Deuba now as posing a serious and untimely threat </p><p>to the stability of the country.  Thus, most are </p><p>"resisting the Party President\'s request" for support. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>OTHER NON-EMERGENCY BUSINESS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Since an Opposition boycott pre-empted much of </p><p>the Winter Session the previous year, many bills </p><p>originally scheduled for action in the first half of </p><p>2001 were left pending in legislative limbo until the </p><p>current session.  Some observers fear that preoccupation </p><p>with the state of emergency--to say nothing of the </p><p>potential for intra-party intrigue within the Nepali </p><p>Congress--may defer consideration of the stalled </p><p>legislation still more.  Among the bills already tabled </p><p>for consideration are amendments to the Health Services </p><p>Act and the Education Act; a Finance Ordinance proposing </p><p>changes to the tax code; and the Terrorist and </p><p>Destructive Acts Ordinance (TADO) promulgated November </p><p>26 (Ref C).  The TADO defines acts of terrorism; allows </p><p>the Government to declare individuals and/or </p><p>organizations terrorists; and provides for life </p><p>imprisonment for those convicted of terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Also pending is a long-awaited, much-touted </p><p>amendment to the Anti-Corruption Act of 1961.  The bill </p><p>is aimed at strengthening the Commission for the Control </p><p>of the Abuse of Authority (CIAA), empowering the largely </p><p>toothless agency to take up corruption cases against </p><p>government ministers and members of the judiciary. </p><p>Since its inception in 1990, the CIAA has won no more </p><p>than partial convictions in just 11 of the 111 cases it </p><p>has filed. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Widespread corruption is often cited as one of </p><p>the prime reasons for the government\'s failure to </p><p>deliver services equitably--which in turn is often cited </p><p>as one of the major grievances fueling the Maoist </p><p>insurgency.  It seems doubtful, however, that discussion </p><p>of legislation to toughen anti-corruption laws will be </p><p>accorded the same urgency as ratification of the </p><p>emergency--if indeed the proposed amendment ends up </p><p>being tabled during this session at all.  Deuba and his </p><p>government can expect to entertain more political </p><p>posturing and proposals for horse-trading from the </p><p>Opposition (and, quite possibly, from some within the </p><p>ruling party as well) in the two weeks between now and </p><p>the Feb. 22 deadline for ratification of the emergency. </p><p>Ultimately, however, we expect the emergency to be </p><p>ratified with comparatively little trouble and to </p><p>continue for another three months.  Whether Parliament </p><p>will so quickly address the many other matters on its </p><p>agenda, including long-deferred action on important </p><p>legislation like the Anti-Corruption amendment, is less </p><p>certain. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
