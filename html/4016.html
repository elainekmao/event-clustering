Over the past several months, Labor Attache and </p><p>other EmbOffs have spoken with government officials, private </p><p>sector, labor unions, non-governmental organizations, and </p><p>child advocates regarding the situation of child labor in </p><p>Honduras.  The Embassy has been active in promoting an agenda </p><p>to support the eradication of the worst forms of child labor. </p><p> We believe that child labor is a serious issue in Honduras </p><p>and will continue to pressure government and private sector </p><p>stakeholders to eradicate the worst forms of child labor. </p><p>The Government of Honduras (GOH) and the Ministry of Labor </p><p>have demonstrated the political will necessary to implement </p><p>and uphold their obligations to eliminate the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  Answers below generally follow the subjects </p><p>specified in ref A.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CHILD LABOR IN HONDURAS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Honduran Government officials, International Labor </p><p>Organization officials, and human rights organizations </p><p>estimate that approximately 400,000 children work illegally </p><p>in Honduras, the majority for their own families, in the </p><p>informal sector, and in rural areas.  Many of these children </p><p>work out of economic necessity alongside other family </p><p>members.  Bonded and/or enslaved labor is rare, but work in </p><p>hazardous conditions and for long hours is common, especially </p><p>for those children who have given up schooling.  The </p><p>U.S.-funded and International Labor Organization-managed </p><p>International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor </p><p>(IPEC) identified the worst forms of child labor in Honduras </p><p>as prostitution (particularly in tourist areas along the </p><p>North Coast), fireworks industry workers in Copan, child </p><p>divers in lobster boats in the Mosquitia (Caribbean coast), </p><p>limestone quarry and lime production workers, garbage dump </p><p>pickers in the two large cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro </p><p>Sula, and coffee and melon agricultural workers.  Of these </p><p>occupations, the most hazardous is diving, and the one with </p><p>the most significant incidence of child labor is in the melon </p><p>industry, where NGOs and the GOH have estimated that </p><p>approximately 2,000 children work as seasonal laborers (ref </p><p>E).  Harvesting sugar cane fields is also a dangerous area of </p><p>child labor. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PROSCRIBING WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Honduras has adequate laws and regulations proscribing the </p><p>worst forms of child labor.  The Honduran Congress ratified </p><p>ILO Convention 182 in May 2001 and Honduras became a party to </p><p>the convention in June 2001.  The definition of the worst </p><p>forms of child labor are identical to that of the ILO </p><p>Convention 182.  All child labor laws, including the ILO </p><p>Convention 182, are applicable in all sectors and industries. </p><p> </p><p>4. Honduras regulates child labor in the Constitution and in </p><p>two codes, one relating to minors, and the other to labor. </p><p>The Constitution (Chapter 5, article 128, section 7) </p><p>establishes that minors who are under age 16 or who are </p><p>students ages 16 and older cannot work.  The Constitution </p><p>also establishes the maximum hours worked for children under </p><p>17 years as six hours daily and 30 hours weekly.  Under the </p><p>Child and Adolescent Code, a law passed in 1996, parents or a </p><p>legal guardian can request the Ministry of Labor for special </p><p>permission to allow children ages 14-15 to work, as long as </p><p>the Ministry of Labor performs a home study to assure that </p><p>the child both shows the need to work and will be working </p><p>under non-hazardous conditions.  The work day proscribed for </p><p>children is four hours per day for 14-15 year-olds, and six </p><p>hours per day for 16-17 year-olds.  No minor is allowed to </p><p>work in hazardous conditions.  In law and in practice, the </p><p>Ministry of Labor carries out the home studies and limits the </p><p>number of permits that children ages 14-15 can have.  The </p><p>Labor Code, passed in 1959 and subsequently revised, </p><p>prohibits night work and extra hours for minors under age 16, </p><p>and also requires that employers in areas with more than 20 </p><p>school-aged children on their farm, ranch, or business must </p><p>provide a location for a school.  In practice, many children </p><p>work without going to the Ministry of Labor to request a </p><p>permit, particularly those who work in the informal sector </p><p>and in rural areas. </p><p>5. International treaties have a status superior to that of </p><p>the Constitution.  Honduras is a party to ILO Convention 138, </p><p>which was ratified in 1980.  It establishes the minimum age </p><p>of work at 14 years and specifies the age for completing </p><p>educational requirements at 15 years.  The United Nations </p><p>Convention on the Rights of Children, ratified by Honduras in </p><p>1990, requires each signatory government to establish a </p><p>minimum age of work, conditions and hours of work, and </p><p>penalties to assure effective application of the law.   The </p><p>above-mentioned Child and Adolescent Code was developed out </p><p>of the UN Convention, according to Ministry of Labor sources. </p><p> </p><p>6. Honduran law defines hazardous work to include: standing </p><p>on scaffolding higher than three meters; use of toxic or </p><p>noxious substances; exposure to vehicular traffic; exposure </p><p>to abnormal temperatures; work in tunnels or underground </p><p>mining; exposure to noise louder than 80 decibels; </p><p>manipulation of radioactive substances; exposure to high </p><p>voltage electric currents; underground diving; exposure to </p><p>garbage or to biological or pathogenic substances; painting </p><p>with industrial or lead paint; work on dangerous machines </p><p>such as those that cut, shape, or file metal or wood; </p><p>activities related to ovens, smelters, metal-working, or </p><p>heavy presses; or high risk agroindustrial work. </p><p> </p><p>7. The minimum age for employment is consistent with the age </p><p>for completing educational requirements in law, but in </p><p>practice, more than sixty percent of children do not complete </p><p>sixth grade, despite GOH increased spending on educational </p><p>budgets and improvement to school access in rural areas. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. In urban areas, these laws and regulations regarding child </p><p>labor are better implemented than in rural areas.  A rural </p><p>economy in which a significant portion of employment is in </p><p>the informal sector and in which parents face high </p><p>opportunity costs to send children to school makes it </p><p>difficult to implement and enforce these measures against </p><p>child labor.  In large scale manufacturing and services, </p><p>however, implementation and enforcement of these measures are </p><p>more consistent.  National enforcement remedies are not </p><p>adequate to punish or deter violations, but pressure from </p><p>international agreements, such as the Generalized System of </p><p>Preferences (GSP) and Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act </p><p>(CBTPA), and awareness of the U.S. Customs Forced Child Labor </p><p>program, have sensitized employers who work in the export </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>9. Regarding the worst forms of child labor, the GOH has not </p><p>yet established enforcement or penalties beyond those </p><p>mentioned above and - for child labor in illicit activities - </p><p>in the criminal code.  Penalties imposed on firms for </p><p>violating the Child and Adolescent Code include sanctions </p><p>between 303 and 1,515 USD (5,000-25,000 Lempiras), or twice </p><p>that if the employer is a repeat offender.  For sale or </p><p>trafficking of children, the criminal code prohibits illegal </p><p>detention of minors and imposes a 14-18 year prison sentence. </p><p> Forced child labor, prostitution, and other immoral </p><p>activities are characterized as economic exploitation in the </p><p>Child and Adolescent Code and are subject to a three to five </p><p>year prison term.  Furthermore, the criminal code specifies a </p><p>seven to 12 year sentence, and a 455 to 909 USD (7,500-15,000 </p><p>Lempira) fine for persons found guilty of prostituting </p><p>minors.  Forced recruitment and obligatory military service </p><p>were abolished under a Constitutional amendment in 1997. </p><p>Adults who use children in narcotrafficking are sanctioned </p><p>according to the Law on the Illicit Use and Trafficking of </p><p>Psychotropic Drugs. </p><p> </p><p>10. In theory, if children are found to be working in illicit </p><p>conditions, either through a labor inspection or through a </p><p>police investigation, the Special Prosecutors\' Office on </p><p>Children, founded in 1997, works with the investigative </p><p>police to uncover evidence and bring the perpetrators to </p><p>trial.  The judicial branch has also established Children </p><p>Courts, where violations of children\'s rights are tried.  In </p><p>practice, the Honduran police and judicial system are rife </p><p>with inefficiencies and corruption and face many difficulties </p><p>in administering justice.  Nonetheless, the GOH has improved </p><p>its police force and recently implemented a new modern </p><p>criminal procedures code that is intended to improve the </p><p>Government\'s ability to bring cases to trial and to </p><p>administer justice. </p><p> </p><p>11. For children employed in the worst forms of child labor </p><p>that are not illicit by their nature but are hazardous or </p><p>illegal for minors, the authority that would investigate such </p><p>cases is the Ministry of Labor, which has trained inspectors </p><p>to identify child labor.  Labor inspectors, upon being told </p><p>of a violation or in a routine inspection, would report the </p><p>incident for administrative action.  The inspection unit </p><p>cannot immediately sanction employers, and the Ministry has </p><p>less than 50 inspectors in a country of six million people. </p><p>Note:  Like most government ministries, a severe lack of </p><p>resources restricts what the MOL is able to accomplish.  End </p><p>Note.  Despite these problems, in 2001, the MOL re-opened a </p><p>regional office and re-initiated inspections of lobster boats </p><p>in the Mosquitia region, where boat captains illegally employ </p><p>boy divers.  The MOL also cooperated with the Honduran </p><p>Private Business Council (COHEP) to launch an education </p><p>campaign among private industries that increases business </p><p>awareness of the worst forms of child labor in September </p><p>2001.  Early in 2001 the Minister of Labor personally </p><p>directed a special inspection of the melon industry in order </p><p>to uncover the incidence of abuse in the sector.  In March </p><p>Minister German Leitzelar visited Choluteca to observe the </p><p>problems of child labor in the melon and sugar cane </p><p>industries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WHAT DOES THE GOH DO? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. The Government provides free, universal, and compulsory </p><p>education through the age of 13; however, the Government </p><p>estimated that as many as 65,000 children ages 6 through 12 </p><p>fail to receive schooling of any kind each year; of these, </p><p>almost 10,000 will never attend primary school.  A number of </p><p>social and educational programs exist that are intended to </p><p>reach children at risk for working instead of attending </p><p>school.  A school grant program run by the Ministry of </p><p>Education (MOE) provides very poor families with money for </p><p>school supplies.  The MOE also provides alternative schooling </p><p>by radio and long-distance learning for children in distant </p><p>rural areas with few schools.  Regional committees of "Child </p><p>Defense" volunteers try to convince parents to send their </p><p>children to school.  Nonetheless, extreme poverty, recent </p><p>famine in rural areas, and lack of jobs for grade school and </p><p>high school graduates create an atmosphere where government </p><p>incentives or programs have not yet stemmed the flow of </p><p>children working. </p><p> </p><p>13. The National Commission for the Gradual and Progressive </p><p>Eradication of Child Labor, established by decree by former </p><p>President Carlos Flores in 1998 and maintained by current </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro (who swore in a new commission in </p><p>May), provides a tripartite working group in which civil </p><p>society (including the ILO, unions, and non-governmental </p><p>organizations), employer groups, and a number of government </p><p>ministries have been able to discuss child labor issues over </p><p>the past several years.  The Commission created a social </p><p>dialogue and forum for negotiation between the groups, </p><p>resulting in broad support for the ratification of ILO </p><p>Convention 182, the development of a National Action Plan for </p><p>the Gradual and Progressive Eradication of Child Labor, and </p><p>the Regulations on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, which were </p><p>drafted by the Commission and passed by Congress in December </p><p>2001.  (Note:  In Honduras, Congress passes a law, the </p><p>President signs the law, the executive branch drafts </p><p>implementing regulations, and then Congress must pass the </p><p>regulations for them to take effect.  This cumbersome process </p><p>is a factor in the inability of successive administrations to </p><p>update many outdated labor regulations.  End Note.) </p><p>Furthermore, the Commission spawned seven inter-institutional </p><p>sub-committees throughout the country that work in a </p><p>tripartite fashion to develop strategies to eliminate child </p><p>labor in Honduras.  Maduro\'s impressive Minister of Labor, </p><p>German Leitzelar - a labor lawyer by profession (see ref B), </p><p>has continued to increase the ministry\'s work combating child </p><p>labor. </p><p> </p><p>14. The MOL also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with </p><p>the ILO in 1997 to support the ILO IPEC program, which </p><p>initiated program activities in the melon and coffee sectors. </p><p> The MOL also established its own office on the Gradual and </p><p>Progressive Eradication of Child Labor. </p><p> </p><p>15. The Department of Labor (through ILO/IPEC) and USAID, as </p><p>well as UNICEF, support several projects to promote the </p><p>eradication of the worst forms of child labor, including by </p><p>promoting school attendance.  In general these projects aim </p><p>to remove children from or prevent children from exploitative </p><p>work, and aim to provide educational opportunities and social </p><p>services for children and their families.  See septel for a </p><p>list of technical assistance on labor issues from </p><p>international donors, including projects combating child </p><p>labor. </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The GOH and the MOL have actively demonstrated the </p><p>political will and found the resources to combat the child </p><p>labor problem.  The industry group, COHEP, has recently </p><p>showed renewed vigor to participate in the tripartite </p><p>commission and to educate its own members on the importance </p><p>of adhering to the ILO Convention 182.  We note that this </p><p>reawakened commitment came on the heels of the July 17-18, </p><p>2001 visit of the USTR-led interagency delegation to Honduras </p><p>to discuss labor conditions.  The delegation determined that </p><p>the situation in Honduras did not warrant opening a review of </p><p>CBTPA benefits (ref D).  The U.S. Embassy continues to work </p><p>with the government, NGOs, and the private sector to send the </p><p>message that the worst forms of child labor are detrimental </p><p>to business with the U.S. and could subject offending sectors </p><p>to U.S. sanctions.  In addition, strong Honduran interest in </p><p>a possible U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) </p><p>is clearly a motivating factor for the GOH and the private </p><p>sector to accelerate efforts to eradicate the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  In sum, Post believes that the GOH is making </p><p>continual progress toward the elimination of the worst forms </p><p>of child labor.  End Comment. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
