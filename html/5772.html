END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>U.S. INTERVENTION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. USAID/DAA/DCHA GARRETT GRIGSBY DELIVERED THE U.S. </p><p>INTERVENTION TO THE WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD ON FEBRUARY 6 AND </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED NATIONS, NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND AFGHAN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN </p><p>IMMENSELY INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, </p><p>ADDRESSING CRITICAL NEEDS. THE FOCUS HAS NOW SHIFTED TO A </p><p>MULTIFACETED RESPONSE TO REBUILDING COMMUNITIES, RESPONDING </p><p>TO THE MANY COMPONENTS OF FOOD INSECURITY, CREATING JOBS, </p><p>IMPROVING EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND EXPANDING SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES; </p><p> </p><p>-SINCE OCTOBER 2001, THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE AVAILABLE </p><p>CLOSE TO U.S. DOLLARS 600 MILLION IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO AFGHANISTAN, MUCH OF WHICH HAS BEEN TARGETED TO WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO STANDING SHOULDER TO </p><p>SHOULDER WITH THE AFGHAN PEOPLE AS THEY REBUILD THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY AND GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AGAIN; </p><p> </p><p>-THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN </p><p>IN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND SEES WFP\'S FOOD-FOR-EDUCATION INTERVENTION AS A VITAL </p><p>PART OF THE LONG-TERM EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THIS. ON THE ISSUE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00644  01 OF 02  181040Z </p><p>OF FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR TEACHER SALARY SUPPLEMENTS, ARE OTHER </p><p>INTERVENTIONS ENVISIONED TO IMPROVE TEACHERS\' SALARIES AND </p><p>THUS OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FOOD RATIONS AT SOME POINT IN THE </p><p>FUTURE? </p><p> </p><p>-THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT BENEFICIARY GROUPS ARE BEING </p><p>CONSULTED ON THE FOOD AID ACTIVITIES IMPACTING THEM.  THIS </p><p>IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FOOD-FOR-WORK OR FOOD-FOR-ASSET </p><p>CREATION. THE ROLE OF BENEFICIARIES IN PLANNING AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTING FOOD AID SHOULD BE A PROGRAM FIXTURE; </p><p> </p><p>-THE PROPOSED LTSH (LANDSIDE TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND </p><p>HANDLING) RATE NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AGAINST ACTUALS AND </p><p>ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE. AS GIVEN, THE FIGURE OF U.S. </p><p>DOLLARS 126.82/METRIC TON SEEMS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH.

THE AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>TIMELY PREDICTIONS OF FOOD SHORTAGES AND INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION OF </p><p>RURAL HOUSEHOLDS WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN IMPROVING FOOD </p><p>SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY; </p><p> </p><p>-A RECENT USAID-FUNDED ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDS AGAINST SUCH </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASES OF WHEAT WITHIN AFGHANISTAN AT THE PRESENT </p><p>TIME, ARGUING THAT PURCHASES WOULD NOT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE </p><p>BENEFIT TO PRODUCERS AND SERVES TO DISRUPT MARKETS; </p><p> </p><p>-ULTIMATELY THE RETURN OF REFUGEES AND ENDING THE </p><p>DISPLACEMENT OF THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED WILL DEPEND UPON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00644  02 OF 02  181040Z </p><p>THE EMPLACEMENT OF A UNIFIED AND EFFECTIVE SECURITY </p><p>STRUCTURE.

ON THE MARGINS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, USDEL HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF WFP AREA OFFICES OPPORTUNELY TRANSMITTING </p><p>MONTHLY FOOD ALLOTMENTS TO THEIR NGO PARTNERS FOR PLANNING </p><p>PURPOSES AND COMMUNICATING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE </p><p>BENEFICIARIES. USDEL ALSO STRESSED IMPROVED REPORTING </p><p>RELATED TO ACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS (TONNAGE AND BENEFICIARY </p><p>NUMBERS) AS COMPARED WITH PLANNED DISTRIBUTION ALLOCATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OTHER INTERVENTIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. GERMANY COMMENTED THAT THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO A </p><p>BETTER JOB IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF TEACHER WAGES AND </p><p>PAYMENT OF ADEQUATE SALARIES IN CASH IN LIEU OF KIND. IRAN </p><p>WAS MOST SUPPORTIVE OF WFP\'S EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOI WAS GRANTING 1,700 SCHOLARSHIPS FOR </p><p>AFGHAN YOUTHS TO STUDY IN IRAN. BOTH THE AFGHAN DELEGATE AND </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS WARNED OF THE DANGER THAT FOOD AID (IN MORE </p><p>THAN MODEST QUANTITIES) CAN DEPRESS PRICES AND LOWER </p><p>EARNINGS FOR LOCAL FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE NETHERLANDS COMMENTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN IS ENCOURAGING CASH-FOR-WORK, BASED ON THE </p><p>PREMISE THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS REACHED A SITUATION WHERE CASH </p><p>CAN BUY WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND THAT CASH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMS. THE WFP SECRETARIAT RESPONDED THAT </p><p>BOTH FOOD-FOR-WORK AND CASH-FOR-WORK HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00644  02 OF 02  181040Z </p><p>IN ENDING POVERTY AND HELPING COMMUNITIES TO REBUILD LOST </p><p>ASSETS - AND THAT PERHAPS THE BEST APPROACH IS A MIX OF CASH </p><p>AND FOOD ADAPTED TO LOCAL NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. WFP\'S CURRENT EMERGENCY OPERATION (EMOP), DUE TO END </p><p>MARCH 31, 2003, IS 83 PERCENT FUNDED (U.S. DOLLARS 240.3 </p><p>MILLION). TWENTY-THREE DONORS HAVE RESPONDED TO DATE. THIS </p><p>STRONG MANIFESTATION OF MULTI-DONOR SUPPORT IS, IN THE </p><p>BOARD\'S VIEW, A TELLING ENDORSEMENT THAT WFP HAS PERFORMED </p><p>EFFECTIVELY. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE NEW PRRO IS SECURITY. </p><p>WITHOUT CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WFP WILL BE CONFINED TO ASSISTING </p><p>PRIMARILY BY SAVING LIVES WHEN THE NEEDS NOW ARE FOR </p><p>RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION.
