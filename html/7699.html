<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: APPEAL OF 2002 MACK CASE SENTENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 2605 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: On April 23, the Fourth Court of Appeals </p><p>heard the public arguments from both the defense and the </p><p>prosecution for the appeal of the Third Sentencing Court\'s </p><p>October 3, 2002 decision in the Myrna Mack murder case, in </p><p>which retired Colonel Juan Valencia Osorio was convicted and </p><p>sentenced to 30 years in prison, while retired General Edgar </p><p>Godoy Gaitan and retired Colonel Juan Oliva Carrera were </p><p>acquitted.  The tribunal listened to five hours of oral </p><p>arguments in a courtroom packed with press and interested </p><p>observers, including the Ambassador, and then told the public </p><p>they would announce their decision on May 7.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Mack Team\'s Arguments </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The public prosecutor Mynor Melgar and private lawyer </p><p>for the Mack Foundation Roberto Romero stated that, </p><p>throughout the course of the September 2002 trial, the </p><p>prosecution proved that Myrna Mack\'s murder was a political </p><p>crime, that Mack was the object of surveillance before her </p><p>murder, and that the convicted material author, Noel de Jesus </p><p>Beteta, was ordered by his superiors in the Presidential </p><p>Military Staff (EMP) to surveil and eliminate Mack.  Melgar </p><p>and Romero both asked the court to confirm the sentence </p><p>against Valencia Osorio and to apply the conviction and </p><p>prison sentence to Oliva Carrera and Godoy Gaitan because of </p><p>their positions above and below Valencia Osorio in the EMP\'s </p><p>chain of command. </p><p> </p><p>The Defense\'s Arguments </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3. (U) Valencia Osorio\'s new legal representation, Francisco </p><p>Flores, spent over 90 minutes arguing his appeal before the </p><p>judges, who ultimately requested that he make his comments </p><p>more concise.  Flores questioned the admissibility of the </p><p>evidence in the case, especially the testimony of former </p><p>inmate Jorge Lemus (aka "El Buki") and the tapes he made of </p><p>cellmate Beteta claiming that Valencia Osorio ordered the </p><p>murder.  Flores also questioned the court\'s decision to lay </p><p>all the blame on Valencia Osorio for what was considered a </p><p>political crime, since he was not singularly responsible for </p><p>designing the GOG\'s counterinsurgency policy during the </p><p>internal conflict.  Flores argued that the Third Sentencing </p><p>Court made an erroneous application of the law, that </p><p>convictions of this gravity must be based on stronger </p><p>evidence, and that his client should be released.  Lawyers </p><p>for Godoy Gaitan and Oliva Carrera asked the tribunal to </p><p>confirm the Third Court\'s decision finding their clients </p><p>innocent. </p><p> </p><p>Helen Mack, Juan Valencia Osorio, and Edgar Godoy Gaitan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>4. (U) Helen Mack asked the tribunal (who also presided in </p><p>the Gerardi appeal and decided to annul the Third Sentencing </p><p>Court\'s 2001 conviction, which was subsequently confirmed by </p><p>the Supreme Court) to act with integrity and independence. </p><p>Mack reminded them that she has worked for justice in this </p><p>case for thirteen years, and that the Inter-American Court </p><p>also requested that Guatemala take this case seriously, after </p><p>years of frivolous dilatory tactics by the defense.  Mack </p><p>asked that the tribunal confirm the sentence against Valencia </p><p>Osorio and to give Oliva Carrera and Godoy Gaitan equal </p><p>punishments because she proved that all three were co-authors </p><p>of the crime. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Valencia Osorio argued that he was innocent and that </p><p>Beteta blatantly lied.  Valencia Osorio said that direct </p><p>communication between a Major (Valencia Osorio\'s rank in </p><p>1990) and a Sergeant (Beteta\'s rank in 1990) was </p><p>inconceivable and that this proved he did not order Beteta to </p><p>murder Mack.  Godoy Gaitan asked that the tribunal confirm </p><p>the Third Court\'s decision because he, too, was innocent and </p><p>had been suffering through the harsh conditions and various </p><p>bloody riots in Guatemalan prisons over the past seven months. </p><p> </p><p>Public Presence </p><p>--------------- </p><p>6. (U) The President of the Court said that they would </p><p>release their decision in another public audience at noon on </p><p>May 7.  After the proceedings, the Ambassador was swarmed by </p><p>the press, who noted that the USG has consistently placed a </p><p>high priority on justice for human rights crimes in </p><p>Guatemala.  The Ambassador told the press that this case is </p><p>important for justice in Guatemala and that his presence was </p><p>intended to convey moral support for the participants in the </p><p>judicial process, especially judges and others who had come </p><p>under threat. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (U) We will continue to monitor the case closely and show </p><p>public support for the judicial process. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
