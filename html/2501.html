<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000377 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PINS, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: 179 REPORTEDLY KILLED AS MAOISTS OVERRUN DISTRICT </p><p>HQ, ARMY BARRACKS IN ACHHAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0333 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM HOZA.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Maoist insurgents attacked an airport, a </p><p>district police office, and an army barracks in Achham </p><p>District in western Nepal shortly after midnight February 17. </p><p> Initial reports indicate 48 soldiers, at least 76 policemen, </p><p>and 55 civilians, including the Chief District Officer and </p><p>his wife, have been killed.  The insurgents reportedly used </p><p>mortars, presumably captured during the November 23 assault </p><p>on the barracks in Dang, for the first time in the attack. </p><p>Four policemen were killed in a separate attack in Sarlahi in </p><p>the southern Terai at about the same time.  The success of </p><p>the attack--as well as its exceptional brutality--will raise </p><p>questions about the efficacy of the state of emergency the </p><p>day before Parliamentary debate on its continuation is </p><p>scheduled.  At the same time, the attack will turn up the </p><p>heat on Prime Minister Deuba, already under fire from </p><p>intra-party rivals eager for an opportunity to press his </p><p>resignation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ACHHAM ATTACKED </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) At about midnight February 17 a large contingent of </p><p>Maoists (initially estimated at 1,500; subsequent Army </p><p>estimates have ranged as high as 3,000) overran the District </p><p>Police Office in the District Headquarters of Mangalsen, </p><p>Achham in western Nepal (approximately 760 km from </p><p>Kathmandu), killing about 49 policemen and injuring more than </p><p>20.  There were some reports that the Maoists may have used </p><p>mortars, stolen during the November 23 attack on the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) barracks in Dang, in the attack.  The </p><p>district police office and the District Administration Office </p><p>were burned down.  Also killed in the attack was the Chief </p><p>District Officer, the senior civil servant with authority for </p><p>the district, and his wife, the local head of the National </p><p>Investigation Department (Nepal\'s intelligence service), and </p><p>52 other civilians in the district.  Communications with the </p><p>District HQ were lost at about 3:00 a.m.; fighting reportedly </p><p>continued until about 6:00 a.m.  Achham Jail was reportedly </p><p>also attacked and all inmates released.  Additional reports </p><p>indicate that the local bank was robbed and the dollar </p><p>equivalent of more than USD 260,000 taken. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The insurgents also attacked a 57-man RNA platoon </p><p>based at Mangalsen, killing at least 48 soldiers.  Two </p><p>soldiers survived the attack and the remaining seven have </p><p>been reported missing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  At about the same time the attack was launched on </p><p>the District Headquarters, insurgents also hit police </p><p>guarding the small airstrip at Sanphebagar, also in Achham. </p><p>Initial casualty estimates stand at 27 police killed.  The </p><p>airport tower, several office buildings and the airport </p><p>police barracks were destroyed.  RNA reinforcements </p><p>helicoptered to the site were unable to land at the airstrip </p><p>because of improvised explosive devices scattered around the </p><p>airfield; soldiers instead rappelled down to the field. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  RNA reinforcements began reaching the sites by </p><p>helicopter by late morning Feb. 17 and conducted search </p><p>operations until about 6:00 p.m.  There have been no reports </p><p>of the number of weapons possibly recovered or suspects </p><p>arrested as a result of these operations. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SARLAHI ATTACK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Also at about midnight Feb. 17, insurgents attacked a </p><p>19-man police post at Lalbandhi, Sarlahi District, in the </p><p>southern Terai, killing four policemen.  One Maoist was also </p><p>killed in the attack.  Police have so far recovered only two </p><p>rifles stolen from the site; the number of weapons still </p><p>missing is unknown. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PM UNDER PRESSURE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was out of </p><p>Kathmandu at the time of the attacks on a visit to Dharan in </p><p>eastern Nepal.  He returned by late afternoon Feb. 17 and </p><p>called an emergency Cabinet meeting.  Meanwhile, politicians </p><p>from the PM\'s Nepali Congress Party were reportedly meeting </p><p>throughout the day to discuss the attack--and its </p><p>implications for Deuba\'s longevity as PM.  The Prime Minister </p><p>is expected to address the nation over local television later </p><p>in the evening of Feb. 17. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The attacks in Achham are unprecedented in scale, </p><p>intensity, and, if initial casualty estimates prove accurate, </p><p>bloodshed, indicating that the Maoists, who on Feb. 13 </p><p>celebrated the seven-year anniversary of an insurgency that </p><p>has already killed more than 2,000 Nepalis, are far from </p><p>ready to give up.  Just as Parliament prepares to debate </p><p>ratification of a national emergency intended to clamp down </p><p>on the insurgents, the Maoists demonstrated they have moved </p><p>beyond their conventional tactics of knocking off isolated, </p><p>under-manned police posts or terrorizing local teachers and </p><p>village leaders.  Instead, they have shown they can </p><p>effectively disable an entire district administration, wiping </p><p>out a whole unit of civilian government authority and </p><p>decimating the beefed-up security forces sent to safeguard </p><p>it.  The 55-person civilian body count, if accurate, is </p><p>especially alarming.   Maoists have killed hundreds of </p><p>civilians since the beginning of the insurgency, but have </p><p>typically targeted individuals--usually local leaders or </p><p>mainstream party activists--instead of engaging in mass, </p><p>apparently indiscrimate attacks. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment continued:  February typically sees </p><p>heightened insurgent activity, but the Achham attacks may </p><p>have been timed to send PM Deuba and his government a message </p><p>as Parliament prepares Feb. 18 to debate ratification of the </p><p>three-month-old state of emergency and its continuation for </p><p>an additional three months (Reftel).  The magnitude of the </p><p>bloodshed will put heightened pressure on Deuba, already </p><p>under attack from rivals within his own Nepali Congress </p><p>Party, led by former PM G.P. Koirala, for what they charge is </p><p>his failure to contain the insurgency and restore civil </p><p>order.  The viciousness of the attacks will probably ensure </p><p>that the emergency will be extended for at least another </p><p>three months; what they will do to Deuba\'s own longevity is </p><p>less certain.  Koirala and his cronies likely do not have the </p><p>votes within the party to oust Deuba (Reftel), but this may </p><p>not prevent them from trying.  While the Maoists may have </p><p>launched the attacks to prove the ineffectiveness of the </p><p>emergency, Koirala et al may see in this national tragedy a </p><p>similar chance to try to prove Deuba\'s ineffectiveness as a </p><p>leader.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
