<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/PAB, EUR/WE, DRL/MLA, IO, IO/ESA </p><p>GENEVA FOR CHRIS CAMPONOVO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, IT, IT, AF, AFPHUM, AFGHANISTAN, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI THINKS SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION ON AFGHANISTAN </p><p>IS INEVITABLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 80103 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 1168 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINCOUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01345  01 OF 02  281650Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  WE DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO BOTH AFGHAN </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS COUNTERPARTS IN THE MFA, AND BOTH SAID THE </p><p>GOI DID NOT SEE HOW A UNCHR DOCUMENT COULD BE AVOIDED. </p><p>VARIOUS EU MEMBER STATES WERE ADAMANT THAT A RESOLUTION (EVEN </p><p>STRONGER THAN THAT ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BY ITALY) WAS </p><p>NECESSARY; A DOCUMENT WAS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE LEGAL BASIS </p><p>FOR UN EXPENDITURES AND ASSISTANCE TO THE TISA; AND "PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION" WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF A RESOLUTION ON A </p><p>COUNTRY WHERE MANY PROBLEMS REMAINED, DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PROGRESS.  THAT SAID, THE GOI IS WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON </p><p>VIRTUALLY ANY LANGUAGE, UNDERSTANDS THAT THE END RESULT MUST </p><p>BE "MUCH SOFTER," AND WOULD ACCEPT EITHER A RESOLUTION UNDER </p><p>ITEM 19 OR A CHAIRMAN\'S STATEMENT WITH EASE.  EMBOFFS </p><p>IMPRESSED ON OUR INTERLOCUTORS THAT WASHINGTON DID NOT THINK </p><p>ANY KIND OF RESOLUTION OR STATEMENT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE </p><p>KARZAI GOVERNMENT OR GIVE CREDIT TO THE PROGRESS WE HAD </p><p>JOINTLY MADE IN AFGHANISTAN THUS FAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  LABOR COUNSELOR AND POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS </p><p>TO CONS. GIUSEPPE CALVETTA, MFA HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE DIRECTOR, </p><p>AND TO MIN. ENRICO DE MAIO, MFA SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, IN SEPARATE MEETINGS ON MARCH 28.  WE ALSO LEFT </p><p>THE POINTS WITH MIN. ALESSANDRO DI FRANCO, CHIEF OF STAFF FOR </p><p>UNDER SECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS MARGHERITA BONIVER. </p><p> (WE HAD HELD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL THREE BETWEEN </p><p>RECEIPT OF THE ORIGINAL GOI DRAFT UNCHR RESOLUTION ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (REF B) AND RECEIPT OF REF A.)  DE MAIO EXPRESSED </p><p>UNDERSTANDING FOR WASHINGTON\'S REACTION TO THE DRAFT TEXT, </p><p>WHICH HE INDIRECTLY ACKNOWLEDGED DID NOT REFLECT ADVANCES </p><p>MADE BY THE KARZAI GOVERNMENT, BUT BOTH HE AND CALVETTA SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01345  01 OF 02  281650Z </p><p>IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHDRAW THE RESOLUTION </p><p>AT THIS POINT.  EMBOFFS STRESSED THAT WASHINGTON WAS NOT </p><p>PREPARED TO ACCEPT A RESOLUTION ON AFGHANISTAN AND BELIEVED </p><p>STRONGLY THAT ANY RESOLUTION WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND </p><p>RISKED DAMAGING THE TRANSITIONAL ISLAMIC STATE OF AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOI HAD THREE REASONS IT BELIEVED WITHDRAWING </p><p>THE RESOLUTION WAS NOT FEASIBLE.  FIRST, OUR COUNTERPARTS </p><p>SUGGESTED, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF TEXT, THE UN WOULD NOT BE IN A </p><p>POSITION TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR EXPEND RESOURCES TO </p><p>CONTINUE ASSISTING AFGHANISTAN IN IMPROVING ITS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SITUATION.  (NOTE:  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS POINT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY, BUT BOTH CALVETTA AND DE MAIO HAVE SERVED IN </p><p>GENEVA AND WERE CONVINCED THIS WAS TRUE.)  SOME KIND OF </p><p>RESOLUTION, CALVETTA EMPHASIZED, PROVIDED THE "LEGAL BASIS" </p><p>FOR UN INTERVENTION AND ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SECOND, MANY IN THE EU (BOTH MEN SUGGESTED IN </p><p>PARTICULAR THE NORDIC COUNTRIES) INSISTED ON A RESOLUTION, </p><p>AND INDEED WANTED ONE MORE STRONGLY-WORDED THAN THE ORIGINAL </p><p>GOI DRAFT AND UNDER ITEM 9 IN THE CHR.  CALVETTA SUGGESTED </p><p>THE GOI HAD TAKEN THE PEN IN PART TO ENSURE THE LANGUAGE </p><p>WOULD NOT BE MADE WORSE.  GIVEN INTERNAL EU DYNAMICS, THE GOI </p><p>WAS CONVINCED THE IDEA OF "MAKING THE RESOLUTION DISAPPEAR" </p><p>WAS A NON-STARTER.  TO BOLSTER THE POINT, CALVETTA SHARED THE </p><p>TEXT OF AN ITALIAN PAPER INTENDED FOR EU PARTNERS, ARGUING ON </p><p>BEHALF A SOFTER RESOLUTION.  (TEXT OF PAPER AT PARA 9.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE THIRD (COMMENT:  AND WEAKEST) ITALIAN POINT WAS </p><p>THAT "PUBLIC OPINION" DEMANDED SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION, IN </p><p>LIGHT OF ONGOING PROBLEMS IN AFGHANISTAN.  FULLY RECOGNIZING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01345  01 OF 02  281650Z </p><p>THAT THE TISA WAS NOT THE PERPETRATOR OF THE ABUSES, CALVETTA </p><p>SAID NONETHELESS EUROPEAN PUBLICS, AT LEAST, "WOULD NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND" HAVING NO RESOLUTION ON AFGHANISTAN.  (NOTE:  HE </p><p>MAY HAVE BEEN REFERRING AS WELL TO EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>NGOS.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  BOTH CALVETTA AND DE MAIO URGED THE U.S. TO WORK </p><p>WITH THE GOI IN GENEVA TO IMPROVE THE LANGUAGE.  (CALVETTA </p><p>WILL ARRIVE IN GENEVA ON MARCH 29 FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL DAYS.) </p><p> CALVETTA SAID THE GOI WAS VERY FLEXIBLE ON WORDING AND </p><p>FORMAT.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE DOCUMENT SHOULD BE MUCH SHORTER </p><p>AND "SOFTER."  THE GOI WANTED A DOCUMENT THAT COULD BE </p><p>ADOPTED AT CONSENSUS, INCLUDING BY THE AFGHAN DELEGATION, </p><p>WHICH, HE SAID, RECEIVED A DRAFT THE MORNING OF MARCH 28. </p><p>THE GOI COULD ACCEPT EITHER AN ITEM 19 RESOLUTION OR A </p><p>CHAIRMAN\'S STATEMENT.  THE THREE DELEGATIONS COULD WORK </p><p>TOGETHER TO ENSURE NOTHING IN THE RESOLUTION WAS OFFENSIVE. </p><p>THE GOI WAS FLEXIBLE AS WELL ON THE IDEA OF A SPECIAL </p><p>COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE PAST HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND WOULD </p><p>ASSIST US WITHIN THE EU IN KEEPING THIS PROVISION OUT, IF THE </p><p>U.S. SAW IT AS A PROBLEM.  CALVETTA REITERATED THAT THE GOI </p><p>COULD WORK OUT ESSENTIALLY ANY LANGUAGE -- BUT A RESOLUTION </p><p>OF SOME SORT WAS VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE, IN HIS OPINION. </p><p>CALVETTA STRONGLY URGED THE U.S. NOT TO DEMAND A VOTE ON THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2985 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01345  02 OF 02  281650Z </p><p>ACTION SA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PA-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------4C7F3C  281651Z /38 </p><p>O 281651Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9018 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KABUL PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/PAB, EUR/WE, DRL/MLA, IO, IO/ESA </p><p>GENEVA FOR CHRIS CAMPONOVO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, IT, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI THINKS SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION ON AFGHANISTAN </p><p>IS INEVITABLE </p><p> </p><p>RESOLUTION, BUT TO WORK WITH ITALY IN KEEPING THE DOCUMENT A </p><p>CONSENSUAL ONE, EVEN IF THE U.S. HAD TO ISSUE A STATEMENT TO </p><p>CLARIFY ITS RESERVATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  DURING THESE AND PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS, OUR MFA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01345  02 OF 02  281650Z </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS (INCLUDING DI FRANCO OF U/S BONIVER\'S OFFICE) </p><p>REPEATEDLY UNDERSCORED THAT BY MOVING THE RESOLUTION TO ITEM </p><p>19, WE WERE ENSURING THAT AFGHANISTAN, UNLIKE BURMA, CUBA OR </p><p>OTHER "BAD" COUNTRIES, WAS NO LONGER ON THAT LIST.  IT HAD </p><p>"GRADUATED."  THEY ALSO SAID THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD </p><p>A GOOD STORY TO CONVEY ABOUT AFGHANISTAN\'S SUCCESS AND COULD </p><p>USE THE REVISED TEXT OF A RESOLUTION AS THE BASIS FOR PUTTING </p><p>THAT MESSAGE BEFORE THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  USMISSION GENEVA WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO </p><p>EVALUATE THE POINTS RAISED BY THE ITALIANS, BUT OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS WERE CONVINCED OF BOTH THE "LEGAL" NEED FOR A </p><p>RESOLUTION TO ENABLE UN EXPENDITURES AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF </p><p>WITHDRAWING THE RESOLUTION AT THIS POINT, DUE TO PRESSURE </p><p>FROM OTHER DELEGATIONS.  WE JUDGE THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>TO CONVINCE ITALY AT THE WORKING LEVEL TO WITHDRAW A </p><p>RESOLUTION COMPLETELY.  IF WASHINGTON REMAINS CONVINCED </p><p>WITHDRAWAL IS THE ONLY OPTION, HIGHER-LEVEL INTERVENTION WILL </p><p>BE REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  BEGIN TEXT OF INTERNAL MFA PAPER (AS PROVIDED IN </p><p>ENGLISH BY THE MFA).  PLEASE PROTECT. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW TEXT INCORPORATES MOQ OF THE SUGGESTIONS AND </p><p>COMMENTS MADE BY PARTNERS.  IN PARTICULAR IT MAKES REFERENCE </p><p>TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION OF INQUIRY </p><p>(OP. 40 PARA 1).  THE WORDING IS THE ONE SUGGESTED BY UK AND </p><p>TAKEN FROM THE RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR </p><p>ON EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGS.  ITALY IS NOT AGAINST IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION AND SHARES </p><p>THE VIEW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD ENCOURAGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01345  02 OF 02  281650Z </p><p>THE AFGHAN AUTHORITIES TO HANDLE THE PAST ATROCITIES.  BUT </p><p>HAVING CONSIDERED THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY IS STILL UNDER EVALUATION BY THE UNCHR </p><p>THAT THE DRAFT CHAIRPERSON\'S STATEMENT ALREADY CONTAINS A </p><p>NUMBER OF SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO THE NEED FOR INVESTIGATING </p><p>CRIMES OF THE PAST AND COMBATING IMPUNITY, AND THAT BOTH </p><p>BRAHIMI AND KARZAI HAVE SHOWN A CAUTIOUS APPROACH ON THE </p><p>ISSUE IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT DELICATE POLITICAL CONTEXT, </p><p>ITALY SUGGESTS TO KEEP A FLEXIBLE APPROACH AND CONSIDERS THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF DROPPING SUCH A REFERENCE IN THE COURSE OF </p><p>FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS OF THE TEXT WITH THIRD COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE NOMINATION OF AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT (OP. 40 PARA C) TO </p><p>REPLACE THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR IS A TECHNICAL RESULT OF THE </p><p>DECISION TO PRESENT THE CHAIRPERSON\'S STATEMENT UNDER ITEM 19 </p><p>OF THE CHR AGENDA.  AS IN THE CASE OF SOMALIA HE IS ENTRUSTED </p><p>WITH PERIODICALLY REPORTING TO THE COMMISSION ON THE </p><p>SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>ITALY BELIEVES THAT SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE INTERNAL </p><p>SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN FULLY JUSTIFY THE DECISION TO TABLE </p><p>THIS TEXT UNDER ITEM 19 OF THE AGENDA.  THE TRANSITIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITY HAS GIVEN CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF ITS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>CO-OPERATE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND WE NEED TO FOCUS </p><p>ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN ITS CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THESE TOPICS </p><p>AND SUPPORT ITS EFFORTS IN THE FIELD.  A COMMUNICATION TO THE </p><p>PLENARY IN THIS RESPECT WILL BE ISSUED BY THE ITALIAN </p><p>DELEGATION JUST AFTER THE PRESENTATION OF THE REPORT BY THE </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01345  02 OF 02  281650Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01345 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
