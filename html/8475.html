<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          JUNE 04, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for June 04, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal/Evrensel: Elbeyli Sub-governorate in </p><p>Kilis organized a conference on May 30 so as to </p><p>turn public opinion against "Armenians\' </p><p>Fictitious Claim of Genocide." It was mandated </p><p>all public employees in town attend the </p><p>conference. Assistant Associate Prof. Dr. Mehmet </p><p>Kabacik from Kilis\' Educational Faculty was the </p><p>speaker of the conference. Kabacik got furious </p><p>when Hulya Akpinar, a member of Teachers\' Union </p><p>Executive Board, asked Kabacik if Turkey had an </p><p>integrated policy in the event the Armenians </p><p>managed to make their case accepted because of </p><p>the strong Armenian lobby in the United States </p><p>and Europe. Kabacik asked the teacher who she </p><p>was, with what title, and on whose behalf she </p><p>dared to ask such a question. Kabacik\'s reaction </p><p>disturbed the audiences. In order not to prolong </p><p>the argument with Kabacik, Akpinar left the </p><p>conference room with her five colleagues and </p><p>returned later. Acting Elbeyli Sub-governor </p><p>Ramazan Yildirim prepared a report expressing </p><p>that the six teachers provoked the conference. </p><p>The court accused Akpinar of "making statements </p><p>and behaving in a manner that would cause </p><p>indignation in public." The judge decided on </p><p>releasing Akpinar on bail of approximately one </p><p>thousand USD. The rest of the teachers were </p><p>released on the condition of reporting to the </p><p>court when needed. Because Akpinar could not </p><p>locate an official to deposit the bail, she </p><p>remained under detention the previous day. After </p><p>depositing the bail last evening, Akpinar was let </p><p>free. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Milliyet: According to a piece of news wired </p><p>on the internet by "Kerkuk-Kurdistan," the </p><p>Kurdish Institute in Istanbul, KII, claimed </p><p>Kurdish and Kurdish culture was under pressure in </p><p>Turkey. The KII and the Kurdish Cultural </p><p>Foundation in Sweden, KCFIS, asked for financial </p><p>support from the Swedish Consul in Istanbul for </p><p>printing one hundred thousand books in Kurdish </p><p>and distributing them in Eastern and Southeastern </p><p>Turkey for free. It is claimed that the Swedish </p><p>government has appropriated approximately 377 </p><p>thousand USD for publishing 20 books in Kurdish </p><p>and distributing them until the end of 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: A union is being established in </p><p>Sirnak for the first time after the lifting of </p><p>the State of Emergency from the Southeast. The </p><p>groups affiliated to KESK (Public Employees\' </p><p>Unions\' Confederation) applied to the governor\'s </p><p>office for opening their branches. The State of </p><p>Emergency, declared in the region in 1987, </p><p>thwarted opening union branches and prohibited </p><p>many activities. It is going to be hard for the </p><p>unions to find public employees who would qualify </p><p>to become members to their unions because the </p><p>employees generally serve in Sirnak for a period </p><p>of two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Bolge/Turkiye: Three people kidnapped Nusret </p><p>Gulec, director of Is-Bank in Pozanti, Adana, and </p><p>held her for ransom. A person coming to the bank </p><p>yesterday morning asked the bank director to ride </p><p>with him on the pretext of visiting a client. As </p><p>the director got into the car two other fellows </p><p>got into the car, too. When Gulec realized that </p><p>he was being kidnapped, he struggled with the </p><p>drivers and the fellows in the car. The car ran </p><p>into a bus cruising on E-5 highway. Gulec and the </p><p>kidnappers were wounded in the accident. The </p><p>police arrested the kidnappers. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
