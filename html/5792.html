<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ENRG, EPET, EFIN, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES </p><p>EMPLOYEES BEGIN STRIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 000332 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  On Saturday, February 15, employees from the Department </p><p>of Petroleum Resources (DPR) went on strike to contest </p><p>unpaid salaries and benefits and protest the GON\'s refusal </p><p>to grant DPR autonomy.  DPR is the agency that supervises </p><p>tanker loadings and authorizes movement of crude oil at </p><p>Nigeria\'s eight oil exports terminals. Sina Luwoye, </p><p>President of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff </p><p>Association of Nigeria sent a letter to DPR management over </p><p>the weekend warning that if demands are not met by Tuesday, </p><p>February 18, PENGASSAN would order all of its members to </p><p>join the strike. Post contacted PENGASSAN\'s Deputy General </p><p>Secretary Bayo Olowosile this morning.  He confirmed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Luwoye\'s warning, however, he added that PENGASSAN\'s </p><p>Executive Council must make the final decision regarding an </p><p>association-wide national strike. </p><p>2.  A DPR Spokeswoman told journalists over the weekend that </p><p>the GON has unfolded a contingency plan to counter the </p><p>strike.  She said DPR plans to send its management staff to </p><p>depots, terminals and jetties to ensure that operations are </p><p>not disrupted.  Replacement staff will be used to sustain </p><p>operations at five export terminals operated by Exxon Mobil, </p><p>ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell, Italy\'s Agip, and CVX </p><p>Research.  Econoff spoke with a US oil representative this </p><p>morning, who reported that as of now, it is unclear what </p><p>impact this strike will have on exports.  If DPR managers </p><p>actually deploy in the field "with the keys to the valves," </p><p>as reported, the impact may be minimal.  Even if DPR </p><p>managers cannot keep oil moving out to tankers at current </p><p>rates, crude will likely continue to be lifted, processed </p><p>and sent to each company\'s onshore storage facilities under </p><p>normal routine.  The representative stated his company </p><p>usually loads two tankers per week for export, and if any </p><p>one company has difficulties loading, others will likely be </p><p>given the opportunity to increase their share of outbound </p><p>production.  Exports will likely be affected if striking </p><p>workers can create a uniform impact at all export facilities </p><p>simultaneously.  The representative also noted that world </p><p>oil prices may be affected simply by news of the strike, </p><p>which has been covered by CNN and the New York Times, even </p><p>if export production from Nigeria is not actually </p><p>diminished. </p><p>3.  Comment: The strike has already created crowds at local </p><p>gas stations amid public concerns of a possible fuel </p><p>shortage.  Several gas stations in Abuja are also limiting </p><p>the sale of fuel to the public due to fears of confrontation </p><p>with PENGASSAN.  If PENGASSAN orders a nationwide work </p><p>stoppage, the other oil and gas union, the National Union of </p><p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) will probably </p><p>offer passive support.  Under an existing pact between </p><p>NUPENG and PENGASSAN, a single body called NUPENGASSAN was </p><p>established to promote greater cooperation between the two </p><p>unions, particularly in disputes involving industrial </p><p>action.  Although NUPENG has not issued a statement on the </p><p>matter, a joint NUPENG-PENGASSAN strike is possible but </p><p>unlikely.  Regardless of what NUPENG decides, since the work </p><p>performed by union members from both sides is interrelated, </p><p>a prolonged PENGASSAN strike will significantly diminish </p><p>overall productivity.  We will know by tomorrow whether the </p><p>DPR strike will spread to the industry at large. </p><p>Hinson-Jones </p><p></p></div>
