<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 011411 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/AGS AND INR/B </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, ETRD, BEXP, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SAARLAND MINISTER PRESIDENT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE </p><p>FUTURE OF THE STATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary: On December 4, Consul General Peter Bodde </p><p>met with Saarland Minister-President Peter Mueller (CDU) in </p><p>Saarbruecken.  Mueller is a moderate, up-and-coming CDU </p><p>leader, and ally of Angela Merkel.  Mueller said the auto </p><p>industry has replaced coal and steel as the most important </p><p>industry in the state.  He regretted strains in the U.S- </p><p>German relationship caused by Chancellor Schroeder.  Mueller </p><p>is convinced that Hesse Minister-President Koch will win </p><p>state elections in February, and pursue a chancellor </p><p>candidacy for 2006.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Saarland\'s Economy: Still Steaming Ahead </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In his first meeting with the Consul General, </p><p>Saarland Minister-President Peter Mueller (CDU) warned </p><p>against an overly negative view of the German economy.  "The </p><p>German economy is still stronger than the French and Spanish </p><p>combined."  Mueller cited Saarland\'s economic development. </p><p>The state\'s nominal GDP grew 3 percent this year and </p><p>unemployment was reduced from 52,800 in 1998 to 45,000 in </p><p>2001.  The state has also diversified its industrial base, </p><p>focusing more on the auto industry.  According to Mueller, </p><p>the auto industry is now the most important in Saarland. </p><p>Coal mining, long a major employer in the state, has no </p><p>future.  The restructuring of the steel industry, which </p><p>Mueller supported in proactive public statements, is a </p><p>success story in Saarland.  One example is Saarstahl, </p><p>Saarland\'s largest, which reduced its workforce from 60,000 </p><p>in the 1970s to 10,000 today and changed its focus to high- </p><p>quality specialty steel.  As a result, the company is now </p><p>showing a profit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) France is Saarland\'s dominant trading partner but </p><p>Mueller emphasized the importance of American investment as </p><p>well.  He mentioned the Ford assembly plant in Saarlouis as </p><p>a good example.  It employs 6800 people and is Ford\'s most </p><p>productive plant in the world.  However, Mueller confided in </p><p>us that the CEO of Ford Germany told him thirty of Ford\'s </p><p>suppliers are in serious trouble. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>German-American Relations, Sister-State with Utah? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Mueller emphasized at the beginning of the meeting </p><p>"that not all Germans think about the U.S. as Chancellor </p><p>Schroeder does."  Mueller criticized the policies of the </p><p>Schroeder government.  "What I don\'t see is a general </p><p>concept, a strategy behind what the Schroeder government </p><p>does," Mueller said.  He regrets recent tensions in the </p><p>German-American relationship and wants to expand Saarland\'s </p><p>ties to the United States.  His Minister of Economics, </p><p>Hanspeter Georgi, was in the U.S. the day after the German </p><p>elections.  In Chicago and Salt Lake City, he reassured </p><p>German and American business representatives of the strength </p><p>of German-American friendship.  Georgi sees Utah as a </p><p>possible sister state for Saarland.  A memorandum of </p><p>understanding between Saarland and Utah has already been </p><p>signed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Mueller\'s Political Outlook and his Relationship with Koch </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Mueller plays a prominent role in the CDU as an up- </p><p>and-coming leader.  He is seen as a moderate and a </p><p>counterweight to the more conservative Hesse M-P Roland </p><p>Koch.  A close ally of Angela Merkel, he did not support </p><p>Edmund Stoiber\'s chancellor candidacy until very late in the </p><p>campaign.  Mueller was also head of the CDU "immigration </p><p>commission" which was convened to draft a new immigration </p><p>law for Germany.  When queried about the proposed </p><p>immigration bill now before the Constitutional Court, </p><p>Mueller predicted the Schroeder government\'s draft bill will </p><p>be declared unconstitutional.  In the end "Schily will get </p><p>what he originally wanted: the Mueller bill." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Mueller\'s relationship with Koch was described to </p><p>us in a later meeting with the President of the State </p><p>Parliament, Hans Ley.  Ley described Mueller as a close </p><p>friend of Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch.  The two do </p><p>"very well together."  The leader of the state\'s Junge Union </p><p>(JU or CDU youth wing), Alexander Funk, agreed that while </p><p>there was no personal animosity between Mueller and Koch, </p><p>the two had vastly different styles. Funk described Koch as </p><p>a "polarizing" figure and Mueller as a "bridge builder." </p><p>However, he also acknowledged that Mueller\'s politics were </p><p>probably "too liberal" for the national party and that Koch </p><p>would most likely be the party\'s standard bearer in the 2006 </p><p>national elections. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: This "new" friendship between Koch and </p><p>Mueller (which hasn\'t been mentioned by our contacts in </p><p>Hesse) may indicate that Mueller is fully aware of the </p><p>growing influence Koch has in the CDU and is aligning </p><p>himself with the rising star.  Mueller himself left no doubt </p><p>that after Koch is re-elected as Minister President of Hesse </p><p>in February 2003, he will pursue a chancellor candidacy in </p><p>2006.  However, Mueller left his own preferences for a </p><p>chancellor candidate unstated.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
