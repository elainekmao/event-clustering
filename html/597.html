<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PHNOM PENH 00577 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KDEM, UNTAC, CB </p><p>SUBJECT: HOR NAMHONG VIEWS THE FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  SOC FOREIGN MINISTER HOR </p><p>NAMHONG TOOK ME ASIDE DURING UNTAC\'S DONORS REVIEW </p><p>MEETING ON REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT FEBRUARY 25. </p><p>AFTER ASKING ABOUT THE CORE GROUP MEETING ON CAMBODIA, </p><p>HE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO SPEAK FRANKLY ABOUT THE </p><p>SITUATION FACING CAMBODIA, EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO FIGHT </p><p>THE KR, EXPRESSING DOUBTS ABOUT FUNCINPEC AND THE KPNLF </p><p>BUT SEEING COOPERATION WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, EXAMINING PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S ROLE, AND </p><p>PROMISING THAT THERE WILL BE A TRANSFER OF POWER, </p><p>WHOEVER WINS.  HOR WAS PARTICULARLY CANDID IN WHAT HE </p><p>HAD TO SAY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. MINISTER HOR NAMHONG\'S PRINCIPAL POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE KHMER ROUGE ARE THE PROBLEM AND MUST BE FOUGHT </p><p>MILITARILY.  CPAF HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE PAILIN, BUT </p><p>HUN SEN IS HOLDING BACK HIS ARMY.  I OBSERVED THAT ANY </p><p>SUCH ATTACK COULD PRODUCE HOSTILE KR ACTION ELSEWHERE IN </p><p>CAMBODIA, WHICH COULD ONLY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE.  HE </p><p>RESPONDED THAT, SOONER OR LATER, ONE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT, SUBSEQUENT TO THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, THE KR WILL BEGIN LAUNCHING ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IF ONE DOES NOT FIGHT NOW, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL </p><p>HAVE TO TAKE ON THE FIGHT.  IF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>PARTY WINS THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES, THERE IS NO </p><p>QUESTION THAT YOU.WILL SEE IT TAKE OFFENSIVE ACTION.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, IF FUNCINPEC OR THE KPNLF WINS, IT IS </p><p>QUITE POSSIBLE THEY WILL SEEK TO BRING THE KR INTO A NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN FIGHT.  THIS IS SOMETHING TO </p><p>WHICH THE SOC IS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED.  PRINCE RANARIDDH </p><p>HAD JOKED WITH HOR NAMHONG ONCE ABOUT THIS, BUT THE </p><p>LATTER SAW SERIOUSNESS BEHIND RANARIDDH\'S JOKING. </p><p> </p><p>-- PRINCE SIHANOUK SEEMS TO WANT TO BRING THE KR IN, AS </p><p>WELL, IN ORDER TO HAVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  I </p><p>RESPONDED THAT WASHINGTON TAKES A DIM VIEW OF SUCH A </p><p>MOVE.  THE KR HAVE WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES FROM THE </p><p>PROCESS, AND IT SEEMS STRANGE TO REWARD NON-PLAYERS IN </p><p>THIS WAY.  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT THE BIG POWERS SUCH AS </p><p>THE U.S. AND FRANCE SHOULD TALK TO THE PRINCE TO </p><p>DISSUADE HIM FROM TAKING SUCH A STEP.  TO MY COMMENT </p><p>THAT THE PRINCE WOULD HARDLY BE PLEASED BY FOREIGN </p><p>MEDDLING AND THAT IT MAY BE BETTER FOR CAMBODIANS </p><p>THEMSELVES TO TALK TO HIM, HOR NAMHONG SAID THE PRINCE </p><p>WOULD INDEED BE ANGERED BY ANYTHING FOREIGNERS WOULD SAY </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE.  HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HUN SEN HAD BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO HAVE ANY FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRINCE ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE, BUT THE LATTER WILL NOT LISTEN TO </p><p>CAMBODIANS, EITHER.  INDEED, HE LISTENS TO FOREIGNERS </p><p>MORE THAN TO CAMBODIANS.  THE PRINCE HAS NEVER BEEN </p><p>WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANYONE SINCE HE WAS BORN; THIS IS </p><p>THE PROBLEM TODAY AND IT WILL BE A CONTINUING PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PRINCE IS PLAYING THE GAME NOW OF CLAIMING THAT </p><p>HE IS THE ONLY PERSON CAPABLE OF SAVING THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>SITUATION.  HE TRIED THIS IN BOTH 1970 AND 1975, AND IT </p><p>DID NOT WORK.  ONE FEARS THAT THE SITUATION MAY BE MORE </p><p>SERIOUS THAN HE CAN HANDLE.  NOT ONE MAN BUT ONLY </p><p>CAMBODIANS WORKING TOGETHER WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH </p><p>THE POST-ELECTION CHALLENGES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SOC, FUNCINPEC, AND KPNLF CAN WORK TOGETHER IN A </p><p>FUTURE GOVERNMENT.  DISPUTES THAT EXIST AMONG THEM ARE </p><p>OF A PERSONAL NATURE, E.G., HUN SEN VS. SON SANN, </p><p>RANARIDDH VS. CHAKRAPONG.  THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>SERIOUS TO PREVENT THE KIND OF COOPERATION THAT WILL </p><p>ENABLE THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO WORK. </p><p> </p><p>-- RESPONDING TO MY CONCERN THAT THE SOC, WHILE IT WILL </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY OBTAIN A DECENT NUMBER OF VOTES IN THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTION, MAY NEVERTHELESS REFUSE TO TURN OVER </p><p>THE REAL LEVERS OF POWER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT, HOR </p><p>NAMHONG AFFIRMED THAT POWER WILL BE TURNED OVER, </p><p>WHATEVER THE RESULTS.  THE SOC SPOKESMAN HAS STATED THIS </p><p>PUBLICLY, AND IT WILL HAPPEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME TO MEET AGAIN WITH HUN SEN </p><p>TO REVIEW THE SITUATION WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HIS </p><p>INTERNAL TRAVELS (I.E., TELLING LOCAL OFFICIALS THEY ARE </p><p>NOT TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE.) </p><p>AFTER HIS CURRENT VISIT TO KAMPOT, HE WILL BE BACK IN </p><p>PHNOM PENH LATER NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT.  HOR NAMHONG IS CLEARLY WORRIED ABOUT THE </p><p>POST-ELECTIONS SITUATION.  HE HAD NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT </p><p>HIS CLAIM THAT THE KR WILL THEN MOVE TO OPEN WARFARE. </p><p>WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HIS STATEMENT THAT </p><p>FUNCINPEC AND THE KPNLF WILL SEEK TO BRING THE KR INTO A </p><p>NEW GOVERNMENT IS VALID.  THEY HAVE BOTH INDICATED TO US </p><p>THAT THEY WILL WANT TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO GET THE KR TO </p><p>COOPERATE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, HOR WAS REASSURING REGARDING PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SOC, FUNCINPEC, AND THE KPNLF IN </p><p>A NEW GOVERNMENT, A VIEW WE SHARE.  WHERE HE WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY OUTSPOKEN WAS ABOUT PRINCE SIHANOUK, VIEWS </p><p>THAT WOULD MAKE REAL PROBLEMS FOR HOR NAMHONG WERE THEY </p><p>TO BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE BUT ONES WHICH MANY CAMBODIAN </p><p>INTELLECTUALS SHARE.  SIHANOUK REMAINS INDISPENSABLE TO </p><p>THE SUCCESS OF THE PROCESS, PARTICULARLY IN ESTABLISHING </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WHICH CAN HELP ASSURE THAT THERE IS A </p><p>RESPONSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS HIS LIMITS, AND THE </p><p>SITUATION WILL WARRANT VERY CLOSE WATCHING. </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
