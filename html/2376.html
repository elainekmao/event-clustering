(C) SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR AND DCM MET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELOR CHARLES UTETE AND HIS CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF ON JANUARY 9.  THE AMBASSADOR CITED CONTINUED U.S. </p><p>ENGAGEMENT IN ZIMBABWE -- COUNTER-TERRORISM, HIV/AIDS </p><p>ASSISTANCE, FOOD ASSISTANCE -- BUT NOTED THAT PREVIOUSLY </p><p>EXPRESSED USG CONCERNS OVER NECESSARY CHANGES TO ENSURE </p><p>FREE AND FAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HAD IN FACT </p><p>DEEPENED.  THE AMBASSADOR CAUTIONED THAT WHILE WE HOPE </p><p>TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE GOZ, GOZ </p><p>ACTIONS WILL BE THE DETERMINANT.  UTETE REPLIED WITH THE </p><p>STANDARD GOZ LINE ON ALL POINTS SAVE THE LATTER, ON </p><p>WHICH HE DISSEMBLED.  THE MEETING REVERTED TO CORDIAL </p><p>VERBAL SPARRING, WITH UTETE SPEAKING MOST POINTEDLY ON </p><p>THE ISSUES OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN ELECTIONS AND THE </p><p>PASSAGE OF ZDERA.  IT WAS OUR SENSE THAT UTETE BOTH </p><p>LISTENED AND HEARD, BUT NOT THAT HE -- LIKE MOST ZANU-PF </p><p>INSIDERS -- IS PREPARED TO EMBRACE A CHANGE OF POLICY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE GOOD, THE BAD, </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR BROKE THE ICE WITH AN EXCHANGE ON </p><p>JAZZ (UTETE IS SOMETHING OF A COGNOSCENTE), THEN SEGUED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00096  01 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>INTO THE USG\'S CONTINUED POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE ON NUMEROUS FRONTS.  HE CITED COOPERATION ON </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM AND NOTED THE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  OBSERVING THAT A LONG STRUGGLE LIES AHEAD, </p><p>HE STRESSED THAT CONTINUED COOPERATION IS ESSENTIAL.  IN </p><p>THE DIRECT BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, USAID AND CDC REMAIN </p><p>FULLY ENGAGED WITH THE GOZ AND NGOS IN THE STRUGGLE </p><p>AGAINST HIV/AIDS.  THE USG HAS CONSECRATED AN ANNUAL WAR </p><p>CHEST OF USD 13 MILLION FOR ITS ZIMBABWE HIV/AIDS </p><p>INITIATIVES.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE AWARE OF IMPENDING </p><p>FOOD SHORTAGES IN ZIMBABWE AND HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE </p><p>LAST SUMMER TO HELP PROVIDE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE.  OUR </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO BROKER A BILATERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITH </p><p>WORLD VISION INTERNATIONAL HAD BEEN SCUTTLED BY THE GOZ </p><p>OVER TECHNICAL CONCERNS, INCLUDING OBJECTIONS TO </p><p>GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, BUT WE WERE WORKING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM AND BELIEVED THAT WE </p><p>WERE NEAR A SOLUTION THAT WOULD PERMIT US TO ASSIST IN A </p><p>TIMELY FASHION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>...AND THE UGLY </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED THAT THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION POSES SERIOUS CHALLENGES FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  A FREE AND </p><p>FAIR ELECTION ACCEPTED INTERNATIONALLY WOULD LEND NEW </p><p>LEGITIMACY TO ZIMBABWE AND ITS GOVERNMENT; TO THE </p><p>CONTRARY, A BOTCHED ELECTION WOULD SPAWN ADDITIONAL </p><p>PROBLEMS FOR THE COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00096  01 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>PDAS BELLAMY HAD MADE SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS DURING HIS </p><p>VISIT LAST OCTOBER (REFTEL), BUT SINCE THAT TIME IT WAS </p><p>OUR VIEW THAT THE PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE HAVE WORSENED, </p><p>SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE PASSAGE OF ZDERA.  DURING HIS </p><p>DECEMBER VISIT, ASSISTANT SECRETARY KANSTEINER STATED </p><p>PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY TO GOZ OFFICIALS THAT ZDERA WAS </p><p>AN INCENTIVES BILL WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IMPOSE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS WERE NOT MET.  HE HAD </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT WHILE CONGRESS HAD PASSED THE BILL AND </p><p>ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER THESE OPTIONS, </p><p>THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR THE GOZ TO TAKE THE NECESSARY </p><p>STEPS TO ENSURE FREE/FAIR ELECTIONS CONDUCTED IN AN OPEN </p><p>MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE BENCHMARKS FOR </p><p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. WERE IN FACT </p><p>STANDARDS THAT THE GOZ HAD ALREADY ACCEPTED -- THE SADC- </p><p>PF NORMS AND STANDARDS.  DESPITE EARLY STATEMENTS BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT SPEAKER MNANGAGWA THAT HE WOULD SEEK TO </p><p>REMOVE SOME OF THE MORE CONTENTIOUS AMENDMENTS TO THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT, THERE NOW APPEARS TO BE A MOVEMENT TOWARD </p><p>A LESS INCLUSIVE ELECTORAL PROCESS ABSENT CLEAR, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1298 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00096  02 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------55CBD5  101220Z /38 </p><p>O 101113Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0694 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 000096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; ALSO AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00096  02 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>COUNSELOR UTETE </p><p> </p><p>INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT BY A NEUTRAL BODY.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE, MUCH </p><p>OF IT ASSOCIATED WITH GROUPS, SUCH AS WAR VETS, WHO </p><p>PUBLICLY IDENTIFY WITH THE RULING PARTY.  THE USG DOES </p><p>NOT WANT TO GO THE NEGATIVE ROUTE AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE </p><p>A FAIR ELECTORAL PROCESS.  WE HOPE THE DIRECTION CAN BE </p><p>CHANGED TO ALLOW FOR A POSITIVE ELECTORAL EXPERIENCE </p><p>THAT WOULD PERMIT IMPROVED RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THANKS... </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UTETE REPLIED THAT ON THE COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>FRONT, AS DISCUSSED WITH PDAS BELLAMY, THERE IS NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OF VIEW.  THE GOZ NOTES WE HAVE </p><p>TURNED AROUND CIRCUMSTANCES IN AFGHANISTAN.  THERE IS </p><p>THE STILL UNRESOLVED ISSUE OF THE DEFINITION OF </p><p>TERRORISM, BUT NO ROOT DIFFERENCES.  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN APPRECIATION OF USG SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS </p><p>HIV/AIDS INITIATIVES, AND NOTED THAT THE STRUGGLE SHOULD </p><p>BE MORE SHARPLY DEFINED, WITH THE GOZ USING ITS OWN </p><p>RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO THOSE OF OTHERS TO CHECK THE </p><p>SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>BUT NO THANKS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00096  02 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>6.  (C) UTETE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHICH ASPECT </p><p>TO DEAL WITH ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, BUT WOULD START </p><p>WITH VIOLENCE.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THE AMBASSADOR RELIED ON NEWSPAPERS FOR </p><p>INFORMATION, WHICH WOULD INDEED INDICATE INCREASED </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HE FELT THAT EFFORTS NOW UNDERWAY BY THE GOZ </p><p>WOULD HELP CHECK THIS, AND ADDED THAT IT IS NOT FAIR TO </p><p>STATE THAT GOZ SUPPORTERS PERPETRATE ALL VIOLENCE.  THIS </p><p>PHENOMENON STRETCHES ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. </p><p>WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IS THAT THERE IS NO MECHANISM </p><p>WITHIN GOVERNMENT DESIGNED TO HAVE PEOPLE BEATEN.  TO </p><p>THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT WHATEVER </p><p>THE SOURCE OF VIOLENCE, IT IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S DUTY TO </p><p>PREVENT SUCH BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) UTETE RECALLED THAT THE POLICE COMMISSIONER HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY STATED THAT VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOZ HAS NEITHER THE PRESCIENCE TO </p><p>PREDICT WHERE VIOLENCE MAY FLARE NOR THE MANPOWER TO </p><p>COVER ALL CONTINGENCIES.  IN THE PRESENT "CHARGED </p><p>ATMOSPHERE," SOME CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WERE INTRUDING UNDER </p><p>THE GUISE OF ONE POLITICAL PARTY OR THE OTHER. </p><p>JOURNALISTS HAD SENSATIONALIZED THIS ISSUE, BUT UTETE </p><p>REASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT IT IS NOT GOZ POLICY TO </p><p>USE VIOLENCE  AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS IN FACT NOT A VERY GOOD WAY TO ATTRACT SUPPORT, </p><p>SINCE VOTERS COULD VOTE FOR WHOMEVER THEY WISHED IN </p><p>ANONYMITY ONCE IN THE VOTING BOOTH.  IT WAS UNLIKELY </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD ABUSED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) UTETE TURNED TO PROPOSED ELECTORAL AMENDMENTS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00096  02 OF 04  101219Z </p><p>STRESSING THAT THERE WERE PROVISIONS FOR AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION REJECTED </p><p>DURING THE 2000 REFERENDUM.  HE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE DRAFT AS "VERY </p><p>FOOLISH" -- WHEN IT FAILED TO PASS, THE GOZ HAD NO </p><p>CHOICE BUT TO REVERT TO THE PREVAILING LANCASTER HOUSE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  HE ADDED THAT ZANU-PF NO LONGER HAS A </p><p>LARGE ENOUGH PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY TO CHANGE THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, AND MDC WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE TO SUPPORT </p><p>ANY ZANU-PF INITIATIVE.  AS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS </p><p>MONITORING (IN LIEU OF INDEPENDENT MONITORS), HE ARGUED </p><p>THAT CIVIL SERVANTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>THE INCUMBENT GOVERNMENT.  THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE POLITICAL PARTY OF THEIR CHOICE, AND AS SUCH </p><p>ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BODY POLITIC.  POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE </p><p>POLLS; BY USING CIVIL SERVANTS, THE GOZ HAD SIMPLY HOPED </p><p>TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING ELECTORAL SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>VERBAL SPARRING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1299 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00096  03 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------55CBED  101220Z /38 </p><p>O 101113Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0695 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 000096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; ALSO AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00096  03 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>COUNSELOR UTETE </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT WHILE HE DID NOT THINK </p><p>IT NECESSARY TO REPLY POINT BY POINT, IT IS A FACT THAT </p><p>SADC-PF RECOMMENDS ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION IN EACH MEMBER STATE.  WE REALIZE </p><p>THAT VIOLENCE IN NOT UNILATERAL AND DON\'T\' BELIEVE </p><p>EVERYTHING WE READ; HOWEVER, WE HAVE NUMEROUS RELIABLE </p><p>SOURCES UPON WHICH TO RELY.  HE CITED THE RECENT </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT BY A WAR VET THAT CHINHOYI AND BINDURA ARE </p><p>"NO GO" ZONES FOR MDC, A STATEMENT NEVER REPUDIATED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  UTETE REPLIED THAT HE HAD LIVED IN THE </p><p>U.S. AND UNDERSTOOD THE PRINCIPLES OF FREE SPEECH -- NO </p><p>ONE EXPECTS THE USG TO SPEAK OUT ON EVERY STATEMENT ANY </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZEN MAKES.  ONLY WHEN SOMEONE ACTS OUTSIDE </p><p>THE LAW IS IT TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN.  THE </p><p>GOZ COULD NOT SPEND ALL OF ITS TIME REBUTTING EVERY </p><p>CRAZY STATEMENT MADE BY SOME "SO CALLED" WAR VET. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE ROOT PROBLEM IS A </p><p>LACK OF TRUST IN THE ZIMBABWEAN POLITICAL SITUATION, AND </p><p>THE LACK OF A MECHANISM TO CREATE THIS.  THE ACTUAL FORM </p><p>OF AN ELECTORAL COMMISSION IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE </p><p>ROLE THAT SUCH A BODY PLAYS IN CREATING TRUST.  IT IS IN </p><p>THE INTEREST OF THE GOZ TO SEEK SUCH A MECHANISM TO </p><p>BUILD CONFIDENCE AND CREATE FAIR ELECTORAL RULES, AND </p><p>RESPECT FOR THOSE RULES.  UTETE AGREED THAT TRUST IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY BUT CITED THE </p><p>MDC\'S "BETRAYAL" OF ZANU-PF BY RENEGING ON AGREED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE AMENDED ELECTORAL LAWS (WHICH FAILED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00096  03 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>PASS A VOTE IN PARLIAMENT). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) UTETE ADDED THAT HE WANTED TO BE FRANK -- THE </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE WAS PUMPED UP FROM OUTSIDE. </p><p>OPPOSITION IDEAS AND TACTICS WERE IMPORTED FROM ABROAD; </p><p>THE OPPOSITION SEEMED TO BE A CREATURE FROM THE OUTSIDE. </p><p>THE GOZ WAS AWARE THAT FOREIGNERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>STAFFED OPPOSITION OFFICES.  IT APPEARED THAT OUTSIDERS </p><p>WERE SEEKING TO INFLUENCE ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNAL POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., HE OBSERVED, IT IS A CRIME FOR </p><p>OUTSIDERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.  HOW CAN </p><p>THE GOZ HAVE TRUST/CONFIDENCE WITH UNDER SUCH </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH ARE GROUNDED IN VERIFIABLE FACT? </p><p>HE DERIDED "YOUR EU FRIENDS" AND SAID THE OPPOSITION </p><p>SHOULD GARNER VOTES IN AN HONEST MANNER, NOT BECAUSE OF </p><p>OUTSIDE WEALTH.  THE AMBASSADOR REPEATED OUR VIEW THAT </p><p>ELECTIONS SHOULD BE FREE AND FAIR, SO THAT WE WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO RESPECT THE RESULTS.  THE GOZ HAS THE POWER TO </p><p>TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO CREATE THESE CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>ZDERA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) UTETE ASKED WHY ZDERA?  DID THE USG INTEND TO </p><p>IMPOSE SUCH ACTS AROUND THE WORLD ON EVERY GOVERNMENT </p><p>WITH WHICH IT DISAGREED?  UTETE SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>WHY WE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH HOW THE GOZ IS HANDLING </p><p>THINGS.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY REGIMES AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD THAT ARE DOING MUCH WORSE.  HOW HAS "LITTLE </p><p>ZIMBABWE" SO PROVOKED CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00096  03 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THIS EXCEPTIONAL TREATMENT.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR CITED SEVERAL SPECIFIC INCIDENTS, SUCH AS </p><p>JAILING THE DAILY NEWS EDITOR ON FLIMSY CHARGES SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE HIS SCHEDULED VISIT TO THE U.S.  SUCH BEHAVIOR </p><p>HAD PROVOKED STRONG FEELINGS.  THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS IMPORTANT.  IT HAS HAD STRONG INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  MANY FRIENDS OF ZIMBABWE ARE </p><p>DISAPPOINTED.  HE CONCLUDED THAT ZDERA IS TWO-EDGED -- </p><p>INCENTIVES AND RESTRICTIONS -- AND THAT WE HOPE THAT </p><p>EVENTS HERE EVOLVE IN SUCH A FASHION THAT INCENTIVES CAN </p><p>BE INVOKED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) NUMEROUS HALF-TRUTHS DO NOT NECESSARILY ADD UP </p><p>TO THE WHOLE TRUTH.  UTETE HEWED FAITHFULLY TO THE PARTY </p><p>LINE BUT SELDOM ADMITTED THE UNDERLYING MOTIVE BEHIND </p><p>GOZ ACTIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION DID </p><p>NOT FAIL POPULAR MUSTER IN 2000 BECAUSE OF PROVISIONS </p><p>FOR AN INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION, BUT RATHER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1300 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00096  04 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------55CBF4  101220Z /38 </p><p>O 101113Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0696 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 HARARE 000096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; ALSO AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00096  04 OF 04  101220Z </p><p>COUNSELOR UTETE </p><p> </p><p>BECAUSE IT CONTAINED ILL-ADVISED LAND REFORM LANGUAGE </p><p>AND BEEFED UP THE ALREADY SWEEPING POWERS OF THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE.

UTETE WAS CLEARLY LISTENING TO WHAT WE </p><p>SAID, AND HEARD THE MESSAGE, BUT THERE WAS LITTLE </p><p>INDICATION THAT HE IS WILLING TO OPT FOR A CHANGE OF </p><p>POLICY.
