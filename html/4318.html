<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 005543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/CCA AND EB/ESC/ESP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, PHUM, CU, ETRD, PHUM, CU, IT, UNGA, ITPREL, UNGA, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: CUBA/UNGA: ITALIAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON </p><p>ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05543  01 OF 02  141424Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 223006 </p><p>     B. ROME 5355 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE.  PLEASE SEE PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) SUMMARY:  IN RESPONSE TO A DEMARCHE ON THE CUBAN </p><p>ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION, MFA COUNSELOR GORETTI STATED THAT </p><p>THE GOI WOULD VOTE THE AGREED EU POSITION.  HE DISAGREED WITH </p><p>U.S. POINTS ON THE SCOPE OF THE EMBARGO, ITS IMPLEMENTATION, </p><p>AND THE EFFECT OF THE RESOLUTION BUT WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE </p><p>EU EOV WOULD EMPHASIZE HUMAN RIGHTS.  GORETTI SHARED A </p><p>READOUT ON THE NOV. 4 EU-CUBA TALKS, WHICH HAD GONE AS HE HAD </p><p>EXPECTED--BADLY.  THE EU HAD RAISED A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND FREE MARKET CONCERNS, AND THE GOC\'S RESPONSES RANGED FROM </p><p>"99.9% OF CUBANS LIKE THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE," TO "WHY DON\'T </p><p>YOU GO PICK ON SOMEBODY ELSE?" TO CLAIMING THAT U.S. POLICY </p><p>TOWARD CUBA AND CUBAN AMERICANS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO TERRORISM. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REF A DEMARCHE REQUESTING </p><p>NON-SUPPORT OF THE CUBAN ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION NOVEMBER 8 </p><p>TO NICOLO\' GORETTI DE FLAMINI, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS.  GORETTI STATED THAT </p><p>THE GOI WOULD VOTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EU POSITION. </p><p>PRINCIPAL GOI CONCERNS IN CUBA ARE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.  "THE CUBAN POPULATION IS STARVING," </p><p>GORETTI SAID, AS A RESULT OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROBLEMS </p><p>CAUSED BY A DECREASE IN THE EXPORT PRICES OF SUGAR AND NICKEL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05543  01 OF 02  141424Z </p><p>AND AN INCREASE IN THE IMPORT PRICE OF OIL.  GORETTI WAS </p><p>CERTAIN THE EU EXPLANATION OF VOTE (EOV) WOULD BE STRONGLY </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE GOC HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) GORETTI TOOK EXCEPTION TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE </p><p>U.S. EMBARGO DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH FREE TRADE, CITING </p><p>HELMS-BURTON, BUT AGREED WITH POLOFF\'S ARGUMENT THAT THIS LAW </p><p>WAS LIMITED TO DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF U.S. FORMER PROPERTY </p><p>HOLDERS.  HE ALSO DISAGREED WITH THE POINT THAT THE GOC </p><p>PRESENTS THE PASSAGE OF THE ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION AS AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ENDORSEMENT OF ITS REPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) IN GORETTI\'S "PERSONAL VIEW," "AMERICANS ARE THE </p><p>FIRST NOT TO RESPECT THE EMBARGO."  AS HE HAD REF B, HE </p><p>REFERRED TO A TRADE EXPOSITION IN WHICH 250-300 AMERICANS HAD </p><p>TAKEN PART ALONG WITH CASTRO.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE AMERICANS </p><p>HAD BROKEN THE EMBARGO BY PARTICIPATING, THOUGH HE MENTIONED </p><p>THE SALE OF FOODSTUFFS, WHICH POLOFF CLARIFIED ARE NOT </p><p>COVERED BY THE EMBARGO.  ACTION REQUEST:  POST WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE FURTHER  INFORMATION ON THIS EPISODE, IN CASE </p><p>GORETTI RAISES IT AGAIN.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>EU READOUT ON MEETING WITH CUBA:  DIALOGUE OF THE DEAF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) GORETTI SHARED AN EU DOCUMENT THAT GAVE A DETAILED </p><p>READOUT OF THE NOVEMBER 4 EU-CUBA DISCUSSIONS IN COPENHAGEN. </p><p>THE FOLLOWING QUOTES REFER TO WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE </p><p>DOCUMENT AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY QUOTES OF WHAT WAS SAID IN </p><p>COPENHAGEN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05543  01 OF 02  141424Z </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) THE EU TOLD THE GOC, "CONTINUOUS (CONTINUING) </p><p>HARASSMENT OF DISSIDENTS IS OF DEEP CONCERN."  IT HAD "HOPED </p><p>FOR A PROPER DISCUSSION IN THE CUBAN ASSEMBLY OF THE VARELA </p><p>PROJECT."  IN REPLY, THE GOC ASSERTED, "NOBODY ACCUSED CUBA </p><p>OF SYSTEMATIC HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, NOR FOR EXAMPLE OF </p><p>TORTURE OR DISAPPEARANCES AS IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES....  THE </p><p>VARELA INITIATIVE WAS PROOF THAT CUBANS CAN SPEAK."  EIGHT </p><p>MILLION CUBANS HAD VOTED TO MAKE THE SOCIALIST CHARACTER OF </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION INVIOLABLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) URGING THE GOC TO RELEASE POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS--NAMING LEYVA, BRUZON, PADRON, AND BRIZUELA, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY--THE EU ASKED THE GOC TO RATIFY THE CIPPR AND </p><p>CESCR HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES.  IN RIPOSTE, THE GOC SAID THAT </p><p>"POLITICAL PRISONERS WERE PAID BY THE UNITED STATES, SO IN </p><p>MANY COUNTRIES, THEY WOULD GET WORSE TREATMENT," BUT IN CUBA </p><p>THEY WERE TREATED THE SAME AS OTHER PRISONERS.  THE GOC </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT, INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, WHICH "HAD A VENDETTA AGAINST CUBA," THE EU SHOULD </p><p>CONCERN ITSELF WITH HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS </p><p>CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH" AND THE FIGHT AGAINST (U.S.) TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO8165 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05543  02 OF 02  141424Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------0864F1  141425Z /38 </p><p>R 141310Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6911 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p>USINT HAVANA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2955 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/CCA AND EB/ESC/ESP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, PHUM, UNGA, CU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: CUBA/UNGA: ITALIAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON </p><p>ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05543  02 OF 02  141424Z </p><p> </p><p>9.    (C) GORETTI INDICATED THAT THE REST OF THE DIALOGUE HAD </p><p>CONTINUED "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH" OR IN A SIMILAR VEIN, WITH THE </p><p>EU PRESSING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND MARKET FREEDOMS, AND THE GOC </p><p>REPLYING DEFENSIVELY OR AGGRESSIVELY.  THE EU NOTED THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN NO PROGRESS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, SO IT WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO SEND THE UN HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE GOC </p><p>REFUSED.  THE EU CITED PROBLEMS FOR EUROPEAN INVESTORS AND </p><p>SAID CUBA NEEDED TO INSTITUTE MARKET REFORMS.  THE GOC </p><p>THANKED THE EU FOR ITS POSITION ON THE EMBARGO, WHICH IT </p><p>CLAIMED WAS "ENDING STEP BY STEP BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM </p><p>U.S. BUSINESS ON CONGRESS." </p><p> </p><p>10.   (U) GORETTI SHARED A THICK BOOK THAT THE GOC HAD </p><p>DISTRIBUTED AT THE MEETING.  ENTITLED "THE FIGHT ON </p><p>TERRORISM:  CUBA--CONTINUING TERRORIST U.S. ACTION," THE BOOK </p><p>CATEGORIZED U.S. ACTS SUCH AS REMARKING ON CUBA\'S BIOLOGICAL </p><p>WARFARE PROGRAM AS TERRORISM.  IT FURTHER PROVIDED A LIST OF </p><p>"TERROR ATTACKS" AND MIAMI-BASED "TERROR CELLS," MANY OF </p><p>WHICH IT CLAIMED ARE SUPPORTED BY THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>11.   (U) LOOKING FORWARD, GORETTI PREDICTED A SIMILAR UNHRC </p><p>RESOLUTION TO LAST YEAR\'S, URGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>REFORMS.  THE NEXT EU-CUBA MEETING IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER </p><p>2003 IN HAVANA. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05543 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
