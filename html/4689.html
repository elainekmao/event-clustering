(SBU) ON DECEMBER 12, 2002 AT APPROXIMATELY 1045 HOURS, AN </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE CALLED THE EMBASSY AND SAID TO THE OPERATOR, </p><p>"THERE IS A BOMB IN THE EMBASSY."  THE CALLER WAS DESCRIBED AS A </p><p>LOCAL MALE, WELL EDUCATED WITH CLEARLY SPOKEN ENGLISH.  THE </p><p>CALLER IMMEDIATELY HUNG UP. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) GIVEN THE INFREQUENCY OF SUCH THREATS IN COLOMBO (THIS WAS </p><p>THE FIRST ONE IN AT LEAST FIVE YEARS, PERHAPS LONGER) ACTING RSO </p><p>REACTED THE MARINES AND CALLED THE SRI LANKA POLICE SPECIAL TASK </p><p>FORCE (STF). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE A/RSO CLOSED POST TWO AND THE PAC AND INSTRUCTED ALL </p><p>VISITORS IN THE CONSULAR SECTION TO LEAVE THE EMBASSY GROUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) POST ONE MADE A SELECTONE ANNOUNCEMENT CALLING ON ALL STAFF </p><p>TO SEARCH THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS.

(SBU) COMMENT:  THE A/RSO IS CONCERNED THAT THIS CALL IS ANOTHER </p><p>REFLECTION OF AN INCREASE IN ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT IN SRI </p><p>LANKA.

EMBASSY AND HOST NATION RESPONSE WAS EFFECTIVE </p><p>AND PRODUCED MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO EMBASSY OPERATIONS.  A/RSO </p><p>HOPES THIS IS NOT A SIGN OF MORE TO COME.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
