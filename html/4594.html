(SBU) Summary.  AES and two other companies presented </p><p>challenges to the State-owned electricity enterprise ENEE\'s </p><p>decision to award Lufussa the contract for the 210MW bid. </p><p>AES challenged ENEE\'s failure to disqualify Lufussa for the </p><p>lack of inclusion of sufficient transmission facilities in </p><p>its original bid, charging that Honduran law clearly did not </p><p>permit the omission. AES has also charged that other </p><p>companies should have been disqualified for not explicitly </p><p>including their proposed type of fuel in the bid.  AES also </p><p>found mathematical errors in the calculations used to </p><p>determine the evaluated price that change the competitive </p><p>order of company prices.  ENEE officials initially </p><p>threatened to sue companies that used the legal appeals </p><p>process, but GOH officials have discounted those threats. </p><p>The prosecutor for anti-corruption and the Honduran </p><p>Inspector General\'s office have both also announced they </p><p>will investigate ENEE\'s conduct of the tender.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On November 26th, AES, Comercial Laeisz and the </p><p>National Engineers\' group all challenged the results of the </p><p>210MW bid, arguing that Lufussa should have been </p><p>disqualified as they did not include a required transmission </p><p>line.  The challenges by the three companies also prompted </p><p>investigations by the prosecutor for anti-corruption and the </p><p>Honduran Inspector General\'s office who both announced </p><p>November 27 that they too would be investigating the tender </p><p>process.  The ENEE board of directors, by law, should decide </p><p>on the three companies\' appeals within five business days, </p><p>although most expect it will take longer. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) AES\' challenge is based on the fact that Lufussa </p><p>was allowed to modify its bid to include transmission lines </p><p>which it omitted from the original bid packet; Lufussa added </p><p>the transmission lines and substations after the July 26 bid </p><p>opening when the company was able to review its competitors\' </p><p>bids.  AES believes this allowed Lufussa to design </p><p>transmission capacity that ensured it the lowest </p><p>transmission losses and therefore lowered its overall </p><p>evaluated price per kilowatt hour (transmission losses play </p><p>an important part in the calculation of evaluated price). </p><p>In addition, neither Lufussa nor Comercial Laeisz included </p><p>the type of fuel to be used, an automatic disqualification. </p><p>AES believes it has a very strong legal case and at this </p><p>point is willing to challenge the bid decision through the </p><p>Supreme Court level if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) With the help of considerable Embassy advocacy, AES </p><p>finally received (on the day before the deadline to </p><p>challenge the tender award) the data on assumptions and </p><p>calculations that ENEE used to arrive at the evaluated </p><p>price.  AES ran the numbers through the model and believe </p><p>they found mathematical errors that would change the </p><p>results, with Comercial Laeisz falling to third place and </p><p>AES moving into a close second behind Lufussa.  The ENEE </p><p>data also demonstrated that Lufussa did, in fact, have the </p><p>lowest transmission losses.  AES strongly believes this was </p><p>only possible due to Lufussa\'s ability to delay providing </p><p>details on transmission until after seeing its competitors\' </p><p>bids. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ENEE and Honduran officials tried desperately to </p><p>discourage these bid challenges.  Members of the "notables" </p><p>committee charged with overseeing the process repeatedly </p><p>stated no company should challenge the decision as it was </p><p>unanimous, fair and transparent.  ENEE General Manager, </p><p>Angelo Botazzi, told reporters the ENEE would counter-sue </p><p>any company presenting a challenge to the bid (implicitly </p><p>aiming this threat at AES).  Now that Honduran companies </p><p>Comercial Laeisz and the National Engineers group have also </p><p>challenged the result, there has been less talk of a counter </p><p>suit.  GOH officials (ENEE board members, some Ministers and </p><p>various Congressmen) have also tried to condition public </p><p>opinion by claiming that the challenges will result in </p><p>future blackouts and a potential energy crisis (since the </p><p>appeals process could bog down in court cases).  AES\'s </p><p>public comments have emphasized that it has only asked, at </p><p>this time, for an administrative review by the ENEE board of </p><p>directors, which shouldn\'t take more than 5-15 days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
