IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY IS BEING VITIATED IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  IN ORDER TO WIN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, </p><p>THE DATE OF WHICH IS STILL NOT FIXED, PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>HAS UNLEASHED A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, </p><p>COMPARABLE IN PURPOSE TO CHINA\'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION. </p><p>HIS TRUSTED AGENTS ARE THE "WAR VETERANS," MISFITS WHO </p><p>MISSED THE BOAT ON THE BENEFITS OF ZANU-PF\'S ASCENT TO </p><p>POWER IN 1980, WHO WE PREDICT WILL REMAIN ON THE FARMS </p><p>UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AT THE VERY LEAST TO SETTLE </p><p>SCORES WITH OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS.  MUGABE HAS FORCED </p><p>WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS (WHOSE WEALTH, AND NOT RACIAL </p><p>PREJUDICE, HAS BROUGHT THEM INTO THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>SIGHTS -- A TRIUMPH OF GREED) TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE WAR </p><p>VETS, THUS GRANTING THE VETS SOME DEGREE OF LEGITIMACY. </p><p>THIS STEP ENSURES THAT THEY WILL RETAIN A SEAT AT ALL </p><p>FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ON LAND REFORM.  IN THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>WAR VETERANS AND YOUNG ZANU-PF THUGS ARE CONDUCTING MAO- </p><p>STYLE POLITICAL "RE-EDUCATION" CAMPS TO FORCE FARMERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02515  01 OF 04  111432Z </p><p>AND THEIR WORKERS TO RECANT AND VOTE FOR THE RULING </p><p>PARTY.  IN THE CITIES WE EXPECT ZANU-PF TO INUNDATE THE </p><p>POLLING PLACES WITH PERI-URBAN SQUATTERS EAGER FOR A </p><p>PETTY PAYOFF, DILUTING CHANCES OF AN OPPOSITION WIN IN </p><p>THESE CONSTITUENCIES.  THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COUNTERACT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY THE RULING PARTY\'S VIOLENCE AND TACTICS, </p><p>BEING NEARLY FORCED TO GO AND ACT UNDERGROUND.  THE </p><p>SHEER BRUTALITY OF THE CAMPAIGN, EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY </p><p>AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHES, COUPLED WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUED INATTENTION TO THE ECONOMY, WILL </p><p>HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGION THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>DISCUSSED DURING SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S STATE </p><p>VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>RECANT AND CONVERT...OR ELSE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ALTHOUGH ZIMBABWE IS SCHEDULED TO HOLD A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS OR SO </p><p>(WE HAVE HEARD JUNE 17 AND JULY 11 AS POSSIBLE DATES), </p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE RUN-UP TO THEM HARDLY FALLS </p><p>UNDER THE RUBRIC OF DEMOCRACY, EVEN MAKING ALLOWANCES </p><p>FOR A YOUNG STATE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION AND ASSEMBLY ARE VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.  THE </p><p>POLICE COMMISSIONER HAS SAID HE WILL APPLY THE LAW AND </p><p>ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT TO PREVENT OPPOSITION PARTIES FROM </p><p>BUSING SUPPORTERS TO RALLIES.  A BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT </p><p>OF THE OFFICES OF AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER THAT SUPPORTS </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MDC.  THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED "THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02515  01 OF 04  111432Z </p><p>HERALD" NEWSPAPER HAS BECOME A CESSPIT OF FACT-TWISTING </p><p>AND SCURRILOUS "JOURNALISM," NO LONGER MAKING ANY </p><p>PRETENSE OF PROFESSIONALISM OR NONPARTISAN COVERAGE OF </p><p>THE NEWS.  IN THE COUNTRYSIDE "WAR VETERANS" OCCUPY </p><p>FARMS, BEAT, KILL AND DESTROY THE PROPERTY OF ANYONE </p><p>SUSPECTED OF EVEN THE REMOTEST SYMPATHY OR CONNECTION TO </p><p>THE OPPOSITION.  ZANU-PF PARTY WORKERS, WIELDING WEAPONS </p><p>IN FRONT OF TOUGH CROWDS, ORDER COMMERCIAL FARMERS TO </p><p>TRANSPORT THEIR OWN FARM WORKERS TO RALLIES FOR </p><p>POLITICAL RE-EDUCATION.  FARMS ARE NOT THE EXCLUSIVE </p><p>VENUE FOR BARBARITY.  ON MAY 10 FOUR MDC MEMBERS </p><p>"DISAPPEARED" IN THE MATABELELAND TOWN OF LUPANE AND ARE </p><p>RUMORED TO BE HELD IN MATOPOS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN ORDER TO SEE HIS PARTY RETAIN CONTROL OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, MUGABE HAS TAKEN A PAGE FROM HIS IDOL, MAO </p><p>TSE-TUNG, AND LAUNCHED HIS CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE, TO BORROW THE ANALOGY OF A LOCAL </p><p>JOURNALIST.  MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR </p><p>VETERANS ASSOCIATION (NLWVA) ARE OCCUPYING WHITE-OWNED </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS AND CONDUCTING A REIGN OF TERROR, </p><p>TARGETING "INTELLECTUALS," SUCH AS SCHOOLTEACHERS, FOR </p><p>PARTICULARLY HARSH TREATMENT AND PUNISHMENT.  WE PREDICT </p><p>THEY WILL STAY ON THE FARMS UNTIL AFTER ELECTION DAY. </p><p>ONCE THE POLL RESULTS ARE IN THEY LIKELY WILL SINGLE OUT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6355 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02515  02 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------55BB92  111433Z /38 </p><p>O 111436Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6004 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID RMCALL AND AFR/SA WJEFFERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/11/2010 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02515  02 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "RED GUARDS" AND SQUATTERS: MUGABE\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN SHOCK TROOPS </p><p> </p><p>THOSE THEY THINK VOTED FOR THE MDC FOR RETRIBUTION, </p><p>BURNING THEIR DWELLINGS OR EVEN MURDERING THEM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A BLUNT INSTRUMENT OF PERSUASION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE WAR VETERANS, SUPPORTED BY THE POLICE, SOME </p><p>PLAINCLOTHES MILITARY AND CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OFFICERS, ARE NOW MUGABE\'S PROTEAN GUARD, </p><p>THE PEOPLE HE RELIES UPON, WITH OR WITHOUT THE ADDED </p><p>BENEFIT OF TRUST OF ITS LEADER, CHENJERAI "HITLER" </p><p>HUNZVI.  THE PARTY AND EVEN THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE </p><p>BECOME LESS RELIABLE, WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH OPPOSED TO </p><p>MUGABE\'S USE OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AS BASIC </p><p>CAMPAIGN TOOLS.  THE STILL-DETERIORATING ECONOMY ALSO </p><p>LENDS THEM NO SUCCOR.  BUT THE LUMPEN, KNOW-NOTHING "WAR </p><p>VETS," MANY BLATANTLY TOO YOUNG TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>THE CHIMURENGA (WAR OF NATIONAL LIBERATION), ARE LOYAL </p><p>IN A CANINE WAY AND ARE, IN OUR JUDGMENT, UNDER MUGABE\'S </p><p>FIRM DIRECTION THOUGH THE CONTROL FACTOR IS LESS </p><p>CERTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FARM OCCUPATION EXERCISE </p><p>THE NLWVA SUFFERED FROM A PROBLEM: LACK OF LEGITIMACY. </p><p>THOUGH EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR LAWLESS BEHAVIOR </p><p>WAS SANCTIONED BY THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, THERE WAS NO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02515  02 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE NEW SYMBIOSIS.  IN ORDER TO </p><p>OVERCOME THE LEGITIMACY HURDLE AND TO BE SEEN AS A </p><p>REASONABLE AND ENLIGHTENED LEADER, MUGABE AUTHORIZED THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS TO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, AIDED BY THE MEDIATION EFFORTS OF FATHER </p><p>FIDELIS MUKONORI, S.J., A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY TRUSTED </p><p>BY MUGABE.  THE FARMERS, DESPERATE FOR RELIEF FROM THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AND WISHING TO REAP THEIR HARVEST, SAT DOWN, </p><p>TALKED AND CONCEDED.  IT\'S HARD NOT TO DO SO WITH A GUN </p><p>AT YOUR HEAD.  THE WAR VETS, MEANWHILE, HAVE NOT </p><p>FULFILLED THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, PEACE FOR LAND, </p><p>BUT NOW WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN ANY FUTURE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON LAND REFORMS.  THEY HAVE PROVEN, AT A </p><p>MINIMUM, TO BE PERFIDIOUS INTERLOCUTORS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE URBAN CENTERS ARE NOT FORGOTTEN </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE RULING PARTY APPEARS TO HAVE ABANDONED </p><p>COMPLETELY ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY, ONCE THOUGHT TO </p><p>BE A STEP TO COURT THE URBAN VOTE AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>GOOD WILL.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NEITHER TARGETING </p><p>ANY OTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT FIGURE FOR ARREST NOR EVEN </p><p>GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF PUSHING FORWARD THE CASES </p><p>OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.  INDEED, THE ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO, WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE COURTS WHICH </p><p>SUSPENDED ALL THEIR BAIL RESTRICTIONS, HAS ALLOWED </p><p>FORMER MINISTER OF LANDS AND AGRICULTURE KUMBIRAI KANGAI </p><p>TO RUN FOR AND WIN THE ZANU-PF PRIMARY ELECTION IN </p><p>BUHERA SOUTH, A CRYSTAL-CLEAR SIGN THAT ALL IS FORGIVEN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02515  02 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FORMER COMMANDER OF THE ARMY </p><p>SOLOMON MUJURU APPROACHED PRESIDENT MUGABE AND ASKED HIM </p><p>TO STOP PURGING PARTY ELEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FOR THE CITIES WIDESPREAD TERROR IS BAD </p><p>BUSINESS, BUT THE RULING PARTY HAS NOT CONCEDED THESE </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES ENTIRELY TO THE MDC.  INSTEAD, IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT ITS TACTIC WILL BE TO FLOOD THE POLLING PLACES ON </p><p>ELECTION DAY WITH PERI-URBAN SQUATTERS, OF WHICH THERE </p><p>ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, AND MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY </p><p>(WHO, ALONG WITH DIPLOMATS, MAY CAST BALLOTS BY MAIL) TO </p><p>VOTE FOR ZANU-PF.  MAKING THIS POSSIBLE IS THE FACT </p><p>THAT, AS THE OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR GENERAL INFORMED US </p><p>MAY 10, ELECTION REGISTRATION CONTINUES, IN SPITE OF THE </p><p>OSTENSIBLY OFFICIAL CLOSING DATE OF MARCH 31. </p><p>TECHNICALLY THOSE WHO REGISTERED AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, </p><p>WHEN THE ROLLS WERE TURNED OVER TO THE DELIMITATION </p><p>COMMISSION, COULD VOTE BY BEING PLACED ON A </p><p>SUPPLEMENTARY REGISTER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WE EXPECT THE INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IN THE RUN- </p><p>UP TO THE ELECTION ONLY TO INTENSIFY.  VIOLENCE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ELECTION REMAINS MORE THAN JUST A REAL </p><p>POSSIBILITY.  IN THE INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY EVENT THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF DOES NOT TAKE AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY, WE THINK THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5398 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02515  03 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------55BB9D  111433Z /38 </p><p>O 111436Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6005 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID RMCALL AND AFR/SA WJEFFERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/11/2010 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02515  03 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "RED GUARDS" AND SQUATTERS: MUGABE\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN SHOCK TROOPS </p><p> </p><p>RULING PARTY WILL NOT ACCEPT THE RESULT.

(C) BY KEEPING TO THE MORAL HIGH GROUND, THE MDC </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE YIELDED STRATEGIC DOMINANCE TO ZANU-PF. </p><p>THE MDC HAS BEEN HARD-PRESSED TO COUNTERACT THE WAVE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND DEMONIZATION IN THE MEDIA, WHICH ARE ALMOST </p><p>DRIVING IT TO CONDUCT ITS CAMPAIGN UNDERGROUND.  SO FAR </p><p>MDC LEADER TSVANGIRAI HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO SAY THAT HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02515  03 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>FORMER ROOST, THE ZIMBABWE COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS, MAY </p><p>CALL FOR A GENERAL, NATIONWIDE STRIKE.  RESPONDING TO </p><p>UNEASE IN THE RANKS, THE MDC LEADERSHIP HAS FLOATED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A GENERAL BOYCOTT OF THE ELECTIONS AS ONE </p><p>OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE OPTIONS.  MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS SAID </p><p>PERSONALLY TO OPPOSE IT BECAUSE A SIMILAR OPPOSITION </p><p>STRATEGY BACKFIRED IN 1995.  MOREOVER, BY DROPPING OUT </p><p>OF THE RACE NOW THE MDC LEADERSHIP WOULD SIGNAL THAT </p><p>SUPPORTERS WHO PERISHED IN THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAVE </p><p>DONE SO IN VAIN.  NEVERTHELESS, SUCH A MOVE WOULD PUT </p><p>THE LIE TO ANY SEMBLANCE OF LEGITIMACY OR CLAIM OF </p><p>PLURALISM, WHEN AND IF THE ELECTIONS ARE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE REGIONAL IMPACT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE IMPACT THAT SUCH DIRE ACTIONS WILL HAVE ON </p><p>THE REGION ARE SERIOUS.  AT THAT STAGE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMY WILL BE IN THE FIRST STAGES OF AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>MELTDOWN, WITH CONSEQUENT REGIONAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS. </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL THE SADC MEMBER COUNTRIES WILL SEE THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF THEIR COMMERCIAL CREDIT RATINGS UNDER </p><p>THREAT.  THE RAND WILL FACE AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS LOSS OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE THAN THAT BEHIND ITS RECENT, NEARLY 20 </p><p>PERCENT DROP VIS-A-VIS THE U.S. DOLLAR.  HOW DEEP THE </p><p>HOLE GETS IN ZIMBABWE IS AT THIS TIME ANYONE\'S GUESS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) NOW IS THE TIME TO CONTINUE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO </p><p>ALTER THIS PROJECTED COURSE WHICH IS GATHERING MOMENTUM. </p><p>U/S TALBOTT\'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STATEMENTS DURING HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02515  03 OF 04  111433Z </p><p>VISIT TO THE REGION WERE VALUABLE.

(C) FINALLY, A WORD ABOUT RACE RELATIONS.  MOST </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HARBOR SOME DEGREE OF DISTRUST, PREJUDICE </p><p>AGAINST OR EVEN FEAR OF WHITES, STEMMING FROM ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>APARTHEID-LIKE PAST, BUT MUGABE\'S CURRENT CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST THE MINORITY LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE MUST NOT </p><p>BE SEEN ONLY IN TERMS OF RACISM.  WHITES LIVING IN THE </p><p>CITY GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS UNHINDERED.
