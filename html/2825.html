<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001318 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LITTLE PROGRESS TOWARD AN IPRSP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  The World Bank invited GON officials and a small </p><p>group of donors to an April 2-4 retreat with representatives </p><p>of African countries that had successfully completed the </p><p>Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process.  The retreat </p><p>was a limited success in reorienting Nigeria\'s approach to </p><p>the PRSP and spurring progress in producing a useful Interim </p><p>Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP).  In an April 12 </p><p>meeting, international donors discussed the results of the </p><p>retreat.  As of now, the process stands as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) The PRSP process lacks strong commitment and an </p><p>articulated vision from the highest levels of the Government. </p><p> Key GON officials needed to make this process work may not </p><p>clearly understand PRSP.  Donors will identify and work with </p><p>GON officials to </p><p>fill this leadership gap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b) Participation by civil society and state and local </p><p>governments is currently insufficient.  Donors will seek </p><p>opportunities to broaden participation by these groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c) The national political leadership is hesitant to reach out </p><p>to civil society and grassroots organizations on reforms </p><p>before the elections for fear of raising questions about why </p><p>the current Administration has not effectively addressed </p><p>these issues after three years in power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d) Donors agree Nigeria should not be pressured to complete </p><p>the PRSP quickly if the result would be a paper exercise with </p><p>little follow-through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e) The World Bank should write the President and Vice </p><p>President articulating a common donor approach to the GON on </p><p>PRSP matters.  This missive will form the basis for talking </p><p>points to be used by individual donor diplomatic missions. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Donors met April 12 to discuss Nigeria\'s progress toward </p><p>an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  Discussion </p><p>focused on progress made during the April 2-4 retreat </p><p>organized by the World Bank for representatives of the donor </p><p>community and members of the GON National Forum.  The retreat </p><p>was designed to educate the GON team on how successful PRSPs </p><p>have been completed elsewhere and to raise awareness of </p><p>poverty measurement techniques and the relationship between </p><p>the macroeconomy and poverty reduction.  The National Forum, </p><p>with 86 members including five members of the donor </p><p>community, is to be reconstituted from the superceded </p><p>National Core Team, which had approximately 35 members.  The </p><p>mandate of the National Forum includes public outreach, </p><p>consensus-building and drafting of the Poverty Reduction </p><p>Strategy Paper.  The National Forum is working under the </p><p>Guidance Committee, chaired by Festus Osunsade, Secretary of </p><p>the Presidency\'s Economic Policy Coordination Committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Approximately three dozen GON officials, including the </p><p>President\'s Principal Secretary Stephen Oronsaye and </p><p>Director-General of the Debt Management Office Akin Arikawe, </p><p>attended the retreat, along with a handful of donor community </p><p>members.  Representatives from Uganda and Ethiopia -- two </p><p>countries that have successfully completed PRSPs -- presented </p><p>their perspectives on the PRSP process. The group broke out </p><p>into three working groups focused on: broad-based </p><p>participation in the PRSP process, the relationship between </p><p>macroeconomic policy and poverty alleviation, and data </p><p>requirements for a successful PRSP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Donor community participants agreed that much work remains </p><p>to be done before Nigeria will complete an Interim PRSP and </p><p>that the GON should not be pressured to complete the PRSP </p><p>quickly.  There continues to be a wide gap between donor and </p><p>GON perceptions of what constitutes a good PRSP.  Some donors </p><p>cited a lack of seriousness among GON officials and a sharp </p><p>division between the few Nigerians who understand the need </p><p>for a PRSP and the much larger group of those who lack this </p><p>understanding.  The participants also noted strong </p><p>institutional competition between GON officials involved with </p><p>the various poverty programs, such as the NAPEP (National </p><p>Poverty Eradication Program), the PAP (Poverty Alleviation </p><p>Program) and the PRSP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. One obstacle to achieving a comprehensive PRSP is the lack </p><p>of high-level GON leadership and absence of a common </p><p>objective.  It remains unclear who at the highest levels is </p><p>responsible for the PRSP; although the Chief Economic Advisor </p><p>to the President is tasked with this responsibility, his long </p><p>absences from the country have kept him out of the loop and </p><p>he has assigned the task to the EPCC.  Completion of a </p><p>meaningful PRSP may depend upon one or more high-level GON </p><p>advocates, or a small group of mid-level, but influential </p><p>champions to push the process forward.  However, with </p><p>national elections looming, the political leadership may be </p><p>hesitant to tackle the PRSP, which implies a commitment to </p><p>fundamental reform.  Many GON officials have commented that </p><p>in the process of soliciting input from civil society, </p><p>expectations will be raised that the government will deliver </p><p>poverty alleviation programs.  No one wants to raise </p><p>expectations at this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The retreat revealed that some Nigerians view the PRSP </p><p>solely as a mechanism to obtain debt relief while others </p><p>focus on the personal political benefits the resources given </p><p>to poverty alleviation can bring.  The donors agreed that </p><p>Nigeria must develop and articulate a clear vision and </p><p>purpose for the Poverty Reduction Strategy and felt that it </p><p>would be up to the Economic Policy Coordination Committee </p><p>(EPCC) to fulfill this need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The donors agreed upon the following next steps: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors need to elevate efforts to include a wider range of </p><p>stakeholders, including state and local governments and civil </p><p>society groups.  To do this, however, all agreed that </p><p>Nigerian civil society must be educated on how to carry on a </p><p>positive and constructive dialogue with the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors must identify a small group of influential GON </p><p>officials who can effectively champion the PRSP process. </p><p>Some proposed names included Stephen Oronsaye, Principal </p><p>Secretary to the President; Akin Arikawe, Director-General of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Debt Management Office; and Bola Illori, National </p><p>Planning Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors will continue to communicate to the GON the </p><p>importance and reformist nature of the PRSP in a variety of </p><p>ways, including through diplomatic channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors should continue work with the EPCC to better </p><p>articulate the GON\'s objectives and vision for the PRSP and a </p><p>deadline for the IPRSP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The World Bank will draft a letter to the President and </p><p>Vice President outlining donors\' views and prepare talking </p><p>points as a common agenda for the donors\' use in bilateral </p><p>discussions with the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment.  Progress on the IPRSP has been excruciatingly </p><p>slow because the GON has not gotten its act together.  The </p><p>absence of a high-level GON advocate for the PRSP, combined </p><p>with the lack of a clear vision and articulation of what the </p><p>PRSP means for Nigeria, continues to frustrate the donor </p><p>community.  There is a growing recognition among the donors, </p><p>however, that Nigeria should not be pressured into completing </p><p>this process too quickly, as this would probably result in a </p><p>document that pays mere lip service without providing a </p><p>realistic and achievable action plan to alleviate poverty. </p><p>Moreover, with elections fast approaching, the GON may not </p><p>want to raise public awareness of the PRSP for fear of </p><p>evoking expectations of significant resources and improved </p><p>social services ) neither of which is likely in the </p><p>near-term.  A viable IPRSP will also commit the GON to a </p><p>course of responsible macroeconomic management, budget </p><p>re-prioritization, and transparency that it is not willing to </p><p>undertake at this point.  In short, Nigeria\'s PRSP will </p><p>remain a long-term objective of the donor community.  How and </p><p>whether donors can support a PRSP process under these </p><p>conditions remains unclear.  Decisions about what </p><p>implications there might be for donor assistance in support </p><p>of programs growing out of a PRSP will not be taken soon. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
