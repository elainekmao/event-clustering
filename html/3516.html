<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001870 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S SDELISI, MRAYNOR </p><p>AA/AFR CNEWMAN </p><p>DCHA WGARVELINK, DSKORIC, CWTHAGELMAN, LLANDIS </p><p>AFR/SA KPOE, MWILLIAMS, MCOPSON </p><p>AFR/DP RBUCKLEY </p><p>DCHA/OFDA DHAJJAR </p><p>PPC RMCCALL, DMAXWELL </p><p>NSC JDWORKIN AND SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NGO AGRICULTURAL RECOVERY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  US Embassy and USAID/Zimbabwe recommend </p><p>OFDA approval of three non-food humanitarian assistance </p><p>proposals submitted by CARE, CRS, and World Vision.  Post does </p><p>not believe that targeted beneficiaries - communal farmers - </p><p>should be the primary focus of humanitarian assistance in </p><p>Zimbabwe; however, these programs are very small in scope, will </p><p>not have a significant policy impact, and can be mobilized </p><p>quickly to assist approximately 80,000 deserving families </p><p>severely affected by the food crisis in Zimbabwe. Post remains </p><p>convinced that the swelling number of IDPs - principally </p><p>commercial farm workers and their families displaced by the </p><p>chaotic land reform program - should be the major focus of OFDA </p><p>recovery programs in Zimbabwe.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The primary USG response to the current complex food </p><p>crisis in Zimbabwe has been to provide food for direct </p><p>distribution to the most needy people through a major </p><p>contribution to the World Food Program relief effort and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>through a separate food distribution program with World Vision. </p><p>There is general agreement in the donor community that the </p><p>current crisis will continue until farmers revive agricultural </p><p>production. Current GOZ policies continue to be the major </p><p>constraint to that effort. Nonetheless, post believes that a </p><p>small agricultural recovery program carefully targeted to the </p><p>most vulnerable families in communal areas is worthy of support </p><p>and will not adversely affect the broader policy environment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Three US NGOs have submitted proposals to develop </p><p>agricultural recovery programs in support of the USG effort to </p><p>respond to the complex food crisis in Zimbabwe:  CARE, Catholic </p><p>Relief Services (CRS), and World Vision International (WVI). </p><p>The combined programs would provide seed inputs for </p><p>approximately 80,000 established communal area farmers that are </p><p>the most destitute and who are be expected to benefit the least </p><p>from any government assistance.  They will be coordinated with </p><p>both existing and proposed food distribution and feeding </p><p>programs.  The programs will provide inputs to allow for </p><p>agriculture production at a subsistence level for the most </p><p>vulnerable families in the communal areas (e.g., women and </p><p>child-headed households, families affected by chronic illness). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Seeds will consist of locally purchased, drought- </p><p>tolerant packages of maize, sorghum, millet, cowpeas and black- </p><p>eyed-beans, where/as appropriate.   The duration of each </p><p>program would be approximately 6 months.   The US NGOs would </p><p>target established communal area farmers who have the </p><p>capability to farm, but no finances; women or child-headed </p><p>households; families severely affected from chronic illness </p><p>(e.g., HIV/AIDS, TB, cancer); the elderly and disabled; and </p><p>those who lost their crops in 2002.  All beneficiaries would </p><p>have to have access to land and be able to farm to be </p><p>considered for the program. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Each of the US NGOs would work in districts where they </p><p>currently have programs operating.  These would include </p><p>districts in the provinces of Matabeleland South, Matabeleland </p><p>North, Masvingo, and Midlands. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The proposed OFDA contribution would be:  CARE </p><p>US$600,000; CRS US$1,100,000 (includes US$500,000 for </p><p>health/feeding interventions for approximately 150,000 people); </p><p>and WVI US$500,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Post believes that any agricultural recovery program </p><p>must take into consideration how much can be accomplished in </p><p>the current environment of counterproductive macroeconomic and </p><p>agriculture sector policies. Post also believes that an </p><p>agricultural recovery program could operate to shield the GOZ </p><p>from the harsh effects of its bad policies and, therefore, </p><p>provide a disincentive for the GOZ to fix the underlying causes </p><p>of low agricultural production. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Even taking these concerns into consideration, </p><p>however, post recommends that this small-scale intervention be </p><p>approved. These programs are targeted at providing subsistence- </p><p>level production for the most vulnerable families, and will not </p><p>work with farmers whose activities have an impact on overall </p><p>agricultural production levels.  Also, because it is modest in </p><p>scale, the intervention is not expected to have an impact - </p><p>positive or negative - on the economic policy environment in </p><p>the agriculture sector, which impedes increased agricultural </p><p>production.  Nonetheless, these small-scale programs will </p><p>mitigate the humanitarian crisis by reducing the number of </p><p>vulnerable people next season who require emergency food </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Finally, post continues to be concerned about the </p><p>situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs), who are </p><p>primarily displaced black farm workers.  IDPs have suffered </p><p>directly from the GOZ\'s fast-track land resettlement program </p><p>and do not typically have communal structures in place to </p><p>support them, as do farmers residing in communal areas.  It is </p><p>also estimated that the number of IDPs could reach nearly 2 </p><p>million people by the end of the year.  For these reasons, post </p><p>believes that the IDP situation should be the highest priority </p><p>for humanitarian resources as the next step in USG assistance. </p><p>During his July 21-23 visit to Zimbabwe, USAID Assistant </p><p>Administrator/DCHA Roger Winter indicated that USAID/Washington </p><p>would discuss the IDP issue with UN/OCHA and encourage OCHA to </p><p>urgently develop a program to respond to their plight.  Post </p><p>recommends that USAID/Washington continue these discussions and </p><p>advise post on progress. SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
