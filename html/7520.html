This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 17, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal: In response to what the fate of the US </p><p>military presence in Saudi Arabia and Turkey </p><p>would be as there was no more need for no flight </p><p>zones in southern and northern Iraq, US Defense </p><p>Secretary Rumsfeld, declared that together with </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ankara, the mission of ONW, and the military </p><p>presence previously in Turkey for that objective </p><p>had been deployed elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete: The US is continuing to </p><p>remove military vehicles and equipment deployed </p><p>at Iskenderun port. It is reported that the </p><p>movement of the soldiers and equipment from </p><p>Turkey would be completed by April 23. After </p><p>departure of freighter "Cape Taylor" the previous </p><p>day, a big quantity of military equipment, </p><p>including six UH-60A type ambulance helicopters, </p><p>were loaded on freighter "Cape Vincent" which </p><p>will also carry the Patriot missile systems at </p><p>Incirlik AFB. The lease term at Iskenderun port, </p><p>where the US had been amassing military equipment </p><p>since February 18, will expire tomorrow. But it </p><p>is speculated that the US has extended the lease </p><p>contract until April 23, and it is expected that </p><p>the shipment of troops and military equipment </p><p>would be completed by then. In the meantime, 40 </p><p>more US soldiers left Batman base. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sabah: The indictment wherein villagers threw </p><p>stones and eggs at the US soldiers who went to a </p><p>village near Sanliurfa where a US missile had </p><p>erroneously fallen some time ago is kept </p><p>confidential. It is reported that the Chief </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Public Prosecutor of Sanliurfa proposed to the </p><p>Court of First Instance to keep the file </p><p>confidential after the news about the case </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>appeared in Sabah paper. Thus the villagers and </p><p>their lawyers have been denied access to the </p><p>files. In response to lawyers\' demand for lifting </p><p>the decision, the court said confidentiality of </p><p>the file was essential for the successful result </p><p>of the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye/Bolge: As a result of operations launched </p><p>by Adana police, 6 alleged PKK militants were </p><p>captured.

The father </p><p>of the victim sued the soldiers at a court in Van </p><p>on charges of "deliberate killing and </p><p>unauthorized burying." Only the victim\'s father </p><p>and his attorney, Murat Timur, attended the </p><p>hearing yesterday which involved seven soldiers </p><p>being tried in absentia. The hearing was </p><p>adjourned to June 6, 2003 on the grounds that the </p><p>documents had not been completed yet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sabah: Because of the amendments made in the </p><p>Retirement Law, which now mandates retirement for </p><p>public employees aged 61, 11 governors recently </p><p>appointed by the AKP face compulsory retirement </p><p>if the cabinet does not prolong their tenure with </p><p>a special decree. The TNP General Director and </p><p>Former Regional Governor, Gokhan Aydiner and </p><p>governors of Hakkari and Van in the Adana </p><p>Consular district will also be retired per the </p><p>law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet: Turkey has been considering opening a </p><p>2nd Border Gate with Iraq and rescheduling Turkish </p><p>Airlines, THY, flights to Baghdad. The Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs\' Coordination Meeting attended </p><p>by public and private sector representatives </p><p>decided the following issues: </p><p>THY would start working on direct flights to </p><p>Baghdad; work on opening the second border gate </p><p>would be expedited, in addition to Habur gate; </p><p>efforts would be made to ensure that foodstuffs </p><p>and humanitarian relief items would be purchased </p><p>and transported from Turkey; efforts would be </p><p>made to build a direct railway to Iraq; the </p><p>contracting sector would be enlivened; special </p><p>projects credits would be given by Turkish </p><p>Eximbank to promote exports and contracting </p><p>services in Iraq; attempts would be made for </p><p>Turkish companies to do oil prospecting in Iraq; </p><p>and a competent representative would be sent to </p><p>the office set up by the US for rebuilding of </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bolge: The Turkish Air Lines\' scheduled flights </p><p>to Gaziantep, which were cancelled due to </p><p>deployment of US troops at the airport for the </p><p>war on Iraq, will restart on April 18. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
