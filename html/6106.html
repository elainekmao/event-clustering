ANKARA 1374 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1360 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Ankara rep </p><p>Bahros Galali called on Operation Northern Watch POLAD March </p><p>3 to inform that after the Iraqi opposition conference in </p><p>Salahadeen, PUK leader Jalal Talabani and Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party (KDP) leader Masoud Barzani met and agreed </p><p>to unify the KDP and PUK administrations and peshmerga </p><p>forces.  They have not announced this to the media and fear </p><p>that Turkey could take news of this move as a pretext for an </p><p>attack by claiming this was a move toward statehood.  If </p><p>asked, the KDP and PUK plan to say this is in fulfilment of </p><p>the Washington Agreement.  Galali said that if the KDP </p><p>decided to fight the Turks, the PUK would be stuck fighting </p><p>alongside the KDP.  Galali told us that at least six Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen parties (including non-KDP affiliates) participated </p><p>in the Ref B demonstration in Irbil, holding banners in </p><p>Turkish and chanting in Turkish "We oppose Turkish military </p><p>intervention."  Galali heard ITF reps on Turkish TV March 3 </p><p>stating the ITF had left the Iraqi opposition and claiming </p><p>Amb. Khalilzad had promised the ITF leaders that if the ITF </p><p>were not included in the opposition leadership council within </p><p>ten days, the US would reject the opposition leadership </p><p>council.  The PUK also alleges that KDP "PM" Nechirvan </p><p>Barzani informed Saddam of US plans and sought Baghdad\'s help </p><p>against the Turks should Turkey intervene.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>KDP and PUK to Unify Admins, Peshmerga </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) PUK Ankara rep Galali asked to see ONW POLAD March </p><p>3.  Galali said that after last week\'s opposition meeting in </p><p>Salahadeen, northern Iraq, Barzani and Talabani along with </p><p>several of their respective politburo members (NFI) had met </p><p>and agreed to unify their administrations and peshmerga </p><p>forces as quickly as possible.  The KDP and PUK are working </p><p>on the mechanics of the unification, but have made no </p><p>announcements about it.  While they saw this as critical to </p><p>strengthening the Kurdish position in the end game before </p><p>regime change, they also realized that the Turks could claim </p><p>this was a step toward Kurdish statehood and use it as a </p><p>pretext to intervene.  The KDP and PUK have not informed the </p><p>Turks or the media of the decision.  If they are asked about </p><p>it, they plan to say that it is in fulfilment of the </p><p>Washington Agreement\'s provisions for reconciliation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Turkmen Demonstrate AGAINST Turkish Intervention </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Galali expressed concern regarding the burning of </p><p>Turkish flags at Ref B anti-Turkey demonstration in Irbil </p><p>March 3.  He told us he had given a statement to Turkish TV </p><p>that had been carried several times already in which he said </p><p>that like Turkey, the KDP and the PUK allowed people to </p><p>demonstrate, including against the leaders, but that the PUK </p><p>did not support the burning of any flags.  Galali said that </p><p>the demonstration had been organized by students and </p><p>intellectuals and that KDP and PUK supporters took part, </p><p>although no leadership figures from either side did.  He told </p><p>us Talabani had urged Barzani to avoid provocations to </p><p>Turkey, but that the burning of one Turkish flag and the </p><p>shredding of another had provoked the Turks.  In an </p><p>interesting twist, Galali reported that Turkmen from six </p><p>political parties, including Turkmen not affiliated with the </p><p>KDP, participated in the demonstration, chanting in Turkish </p><p>and carrying banners in Turkish that read "We oppose Turkish </p><p>military intervention," and "We don\'t need Turkey in our </p><p>country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Northern Iraqis Incited by GOT Remarks </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Galali continued, saying that the demonstration </p><p>indicated that the people of northern Iraq were now "really </p><p>afraid" of a Turkish intervention.  "If they want to stop </p><p>refugees, why do they not stay on their border, or within a </p><p>few km of it?  But the Foreign Minister (Yakis) tells the </p><p>press repeatedly they will send 80,000 soldiers and take away </p><p>the guns from the Kurds.  Erdogan told CNN Turk that if the </p><p>US sends 40,000 troops, Turkey will send 80,000, and if the </p><p>US sends 80,000, Turkey will send 160,000.  This is a big </p><p>mistake, and is making Barzani intransigent and emotional." </p><p>Galali said the northern Iraqis were now sure that Turkey </p><p>wanted to send its army to Irbil and Chamchamal, disarm the </p><p>peshmerga and prevent displaced Kurds from returning home. </p><p>He added that no Iraqi Kurd would relinquish his gun to a </p><p>Turkish soldier and that a Turkish intervention was a recipe </p><p>for chaos.  How, he asked, could Turkey be unwilling to allow </p><p>Kurds who had been evicted from their homes in Kirkuk or </p><p>Mosul to return, even if they went unarmed?  "Iraq," he said, </p><p>exasperated, "is not Turkey and is not a Turkish country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ITF Claims All Northern Iraq is Turkmen Land </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Galali was upset about interviews with ITF reps </p><p>that have aired in the past few days on Turkish television. </p><p>In one, the ITF claimed that the Iraqi Kurds were </p><p>distributing fake ID\'s to Kurds showing them to be displaced </p><p>from Kirkuk so that the Kurds could take over that city. </p><p>Galali said that Hasan Osman, Kemal Baytli, Sa\'adun Koproglu </p><p>and Sanan Aga (via telephone from Irbil) had given interviews </p><p>to NTV (Turkish TV news) March 3, in which they said nothing </p><p>about Saddam Hussein, but did claim that Irbil is a Turkish </p><p>city that Barzani had taken from the Turkmen; showed what </p><p>Galali described as a "shocking" map identifying everything </p><p>in northern Iraq from Diyala to Zahko as Turkmen territory; </p><p>and claimed there were at least 3.5 million Turkmen in Iraq. </p><p>Galali contested those numbers strongly and posited that the </p><p>Turks were trying to use the ITF to provoke the Kurds and </p><p>create a pretext for Turkish intervention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>ITF: US Promised To Reject Opposition Leadership </p><p>Unless ITF Gets Spot in Leadership Council </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Galali told us that the ITF reps claimed in the NTV </p><p>interview that the ITF had dropped out of the Iraqi </p><p>opposition following the Salahadeen conferece, but that Amb. </p><p>Khalilzad had promised ITF leaders that if the ITF was not </p><p>included in the opposition\'s leadership council within ten </p><p>days, the US would reject the leadership council.  Galali </p><p>said that when Hasan Osman was asked if the ITF supported the </p><p>US plan for Iraq, Osman said flatly, "No.  We do not." </p><p>Galali shared with us a conversation PUK peshmerga hero and </p><p>former "PM" Khosrat Rasul Ali had with ITF Chairman Sanan Aga </p><p>on the margins of the Salahadeen conference.  According to </p><p>Galali, Khosrat asked Aga why he had changed so much from </p><p>being a friend of the Kurds to being so strongly opposed to </p><p>them.  Aga replied "What I have said isn\'t half of what </p><p>Ankara told me to say."  In Galali\'s view, the Turks have </p><p>chosen the wrong surrogates in northern Iraq.  There are </p><p>Turkmen there that everyone can work with, he told us, but </p><p>Sanan Aga was with Saddam until four years ago and is not </p><p>anti-Saddam today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF) Galali described the situation in northern Iraq as </p><p>"very bad" for the KDP and the PUK.  Talabani, he said, wants </p><p>to work with the Turks so that the US plan will succeed, but </p><p>Barzani is defiant and playing the role of defender of the </p><p>Kurds against the Turks.  "If Barzani decides to fight the </p><p>Turks, we will be stuck alongside him." </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PUK Says Nechirvan Went to Saddam w/US Plans </p><p>Seeking Help vs. Turkey </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NF) Finally, Galali said the PUK had information that </p><p>after Amb. Khalilzad\'s early Feb. visit to Ankara, Nechirvan </p><p>Barzani had contacted Saddam, briefed him on US plans as </p><p>presented by Khalilzad, and asked for Saddam\'s support </p><p>against Turkey should Turkey intervene in northern Iraq. </p><p>Galali said that Barzani knew that the KDP could not hope to </p><p>fend off the Turks by themselves and did not believe the US </p><p>would do so for them.  Comment:  We have no way of knowing if </p><p>Barzani actually contacted Baghdad or, if so, what was said. </p><p>We note that Galali views Nechirvan with contempt and that </p><p>the PUK keeps Barzani\'s 1996 decision to seek Saddam\'s </p><p>assistance squarely in mind.  However, the scenario is </p><p>plausible.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
