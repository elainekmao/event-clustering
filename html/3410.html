<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/EX FOR JAMIE AGNEW, DS/OP/AF, DS/PSP/FPD </p><p>FOR M/OBO FOR EMIL PIEKARZ </p><p>POSTS FOR ESO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEGRADING SECURITY SITUATION DUE TO POWER </p><p>PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER: REASON: 1.5(G) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: This is an immediate action request (see </p><p>para 5).  Since July 13 Post has experienced numerous power </p><p>and generator related problems resulting in the failure or </p><p>breakdown of vital security and communication equipment. </p><p>These breakdowns have degraded the Embassy\'s security </p><p>posture and materially diminished our communications </p><p>abilities.  On July 31, most Embassy operations were shut </p><p>down for three hours due to this recurrent problem.  To </p><p>prevent the further degradation of our security and </p><p>communication equipment and to ensure that the Embassy is </p><p>not faced with another unexpected halt in its operations, </p><p>Post requests Department send a team to help identify and </p><p>solve our power supply problems which have now reached a </p><p>critical stage.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After installation of a new generator transfer switch </p><p>and generator on July 13, we have experienced ongoing power </p><p>supply problems affecting the IOB and the Compound Access </p><p>Control (CAC) facility, resulting in damage to some of our </p><p>most important and sensitive security and communication </p><p>equipment.  We have had 2 complete power blackouts (totaling </p><p>2.5 hours), 72 hours with low voltage (averaging 213 volts), </p><p>multiple surges (maxing out at 280 volts), numerous tripped </p><p>breakers, and this morning the mag locks jammed with no way </p><p>to turn them off.  Each disturbance caused damage, the </p><p>cumulative effect of which has been the continual erosion of </p><p>Post\'s physical security and Post\'s ability to function. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Damage has been significant.  Several CCTV monitors </p><p>have been destroyed, two (2) walkthrough metal detectors are </p><p>inoperable, 1 Hirsch access control keypad is unusable, we </p><p>have lost use of the explosives detection itemizer unit, our </p><p>E&E base station radio, 1 power supply and transformer </p><p>within the Post Communications Center (PCC), as well as </p><p>numerous UPS units.  Other items have been locally repaired </p><p>to temporary functionality, including all CAC door controls, </p><p>the Embassy switchboard, motorized compound vehicle access </p><p>gates and the hardline security doors on both the IOB and </p><p>EOB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We are extremely concerned about Post\'s diminishing </p><p>security posture. RSO\'s replacement security equipment stock </p><p>has been nearly depleted and we cannot sustain many more </p><p>losses to this inventory.  Our concerns are compounded </p><p>because we do not have the expertise at Post to pinpoint and </p><p>isolate the problem.  An equipment-damaging reoccurrence </p><p>could take place at any time.  SEO Lagos is en route to </p><p>Abuja to attempt to repair some of the damage to the </p><p>security equipment, but the SEO does not have the expertise </p><p>to tackle the source of this overall facility power problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action request: Post requests immediate assistance of </p><p>a team of qualified, cleared electricians (presumably </p><p>WASHMAC) to help identify and solve the continuous power </p><p>problems we are facing. In addition the Embassy requests </p><p>expedited consideration of the funded generator survey Post </p><p>submitted for OBO final approval.  The situation has become </p><p>critical. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
