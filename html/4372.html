A </p><p>MODEST GROUP OF PROTESTORS (ESTIMATES RANGED FROM 3,000 AND </p><p>5,000) VIED FOR MEDIA ATTENTION BY ORGANIZING A </p><p>\'COUNTERSUMMIT\' TO PROTEST THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>IMMIGRATION POLICY, CONCENTRATING ON THE RECENTLY-ENACTED </p><p>BOSSI-FINI LEGISLATION (REF A).

WE EXPECT TO SEE THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT REACHING INTO THE SAME TOOLBOX NEXT YEAR AS IT </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PUSH THE EU  TO ADOPT A TOUGHER, MORE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE \'SOLUTION\' TO THE PHENOMENON. </p><p> </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05595 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
