<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001748 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD, AF/W, AF/RA, IIP/G/AF, IIP/T/G </p><p>USAID/W FOR AFR, G/PHN (DELAY) </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO IBB FOR VOA (ENGLISH TO AFRICA </p><p>SERVICE, HAUSA SERVICE) </p><p>EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES FOR PAS, POL, ECON, </p><p>USAID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, KPAO, OIIP, SCUL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE A-B-C-D OF AIDS -- NIGERIAN </p><p>WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS WANT MORE ON "A," </p><p>ABSTINENCE, AND MORE ON "B," BE FAITHFUL </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  Nigerians who focus on the HIV/AIDS </p><p>epidemic use A-B-C-D (A-Abstain, B-Be faithful, </p><p>C-use Condoms, OR D-you Die) as a mnemonic device </p><p>with target audiences.  Sixty activists and </p><p>program leaders -- Muslim and Christian -- who </p><p>attended one of the two two-day workshops in </p><p>Kaduna and Lagos with U.S. Speaker Rev. Eugene </p><p>Rivers listened with rapt attention and growing </p><p>enthusiasm to his presentations on the U.S. </p><p>experience with faith-based programs that promote </p><p>abstinence and fidelity.  They unanimously asked </p><p>for more focus, more programs, and more tools to </p><p>promote the "A" and "B" in the formula -- </p><p>abstinence and fidelity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Attending all of the sessions at the workshop </p><p>in Lagos was the First Lady of Cross River State. </p><p>A Reuters cameraman from Abidjan taped some of </p><p>Rivers\' presentations in Lagos for a possible </p><p>segment on "Sixty Minutes."  This is a GPRA </p><p>report.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The PAS sections in Abuja and Lagos organized </p><p>two-day workshops for visiting U.S. speaker </p><p>Boston-based Rev. Eugene Rivers, pastor of the </p><p>Azuza Christian Community and co-chair of the </p><p>National TenPoint Coalition.  AIDS activists and </p><p>program leaders, with a strong representation of </p><p>pastors and imams, gathered in Kaduna on June 3-4 </p><p>and in Lagos on June 6-7.  The programs -- </p><p>"Faith-Based Approaches to Combat HIV-AIDS: Focus </p><p>on Abstinence and Fidelity" also provided an </p><p>excellent introduction to the Bush </p><p>Administration\'s initiatives with faith-based </p><p>programs.  The sessions were attended by every </p><p>invitee, with not even one no-show. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Rivers, an energetic and convictional teacher </p><p>who alternates between the languages of the </p><p>university classroom and the pulpit, first framed </p><p>the HIV/AIDS epidemic in an unaccustomed way, </p><p>avoiding polite circumlocutions.  It is a "sexual </p><p>holocaust" that will produce 40 million orphans </p><p>and untold social disruption across the continent </p><p>unless radical changes in the behavior that </p><p>communicates the disease -- he bluntly called it </p><p>"promiscuity" -- occur, especially among African </p><p>men who exploit the continent\'s women and girls. </p><p>Newborns infected with AIDS may be a new </p><p>"biological underclass." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  In Rivers\' view, the epidemic is not simply </p><p>medical.  It is also a human rights issue: men </p><p>who infect women are committing fatal violations </p><p>of their human rights.  And it has a moral </p><p>dimension because the behavior that will reverse </p><p>the rise in HIV/AIDS incidence -- fidelity in </p><p>marriage, abstinence before marriage -- must be </p><p>grounded in deeper understandings of human </p><p>sexuality, dignity, and respect.  Faith </p><p>communities, he said, are best positioned to </p><p>teach the underlying values that can change </p><p>behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Each audience -- mostly Muslim in Kaduna, </p><p>mostly Christian in Lagos -- had issues to dispel </p><p>before Rivers could get to the heart of his </p><p>program.  In the north, the chairman of the </p><p>Jaamat Nazrili Islam used his welcoming remarks </p><p>to re-air the rumors that the AIDS virus had been </p><p>developed in U.S. labs and say that it was </p><p>necessary to understand the true origins of the </p><p>virus before deciding on how to approach the </p><p>epidemic.  He also said "the U.S. has never </p><p>officially denied this."  After the PAO </p><p>emphatically stated the denial for the record, </p><p>explaining some of the Cold War disinformation </p><p>that set the rumor in motion, Rivers suggested </p><p>that dwelling on the origins of disease was a </p><p>distraction or excuse that could only delay the </p><p>immediate imperative -- to deal with the </p><p>epidemic.  Delay would cost many more lives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Other audience members said the way to end </p><p>the epidemic was to attack its true "root causes" </p><p>-- poverty, or the status of women, or crushing </p><p>external debts, or lack of education, for </p><p>instance.  Rivers agreed that all these issues </p><p>must be addressed, but he said there was no time </p><p>to wait for root causes to be solved.  This focus </p><p>was a distraction or an excuse for no action. </p><p>The immediate prospect of death for so many </p><p>millions required immediate, direct action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(In Lagos, participants told Rivers that the </p><p>current rumor circulating among young people is </p><p>that the U.S. wants to use the AIDS epidemic to </p><p>keep Africans from having sex.  Rivers urged all </p><p>the participants to fight this rumor.  Young </p><p>people who acted on it would only increase the </p><p>risks of their own infection and death.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Some participants voiced doubt that the </p><p>experience of a pastor in a U.S. inner city was </p><p>relevant to the different circumstances of </p><p>Nigeria, but Rivers deeply impressed them with </p><p>parallels.  Both countries confront the ubiquity </p><p>of upfront sexuality in popular music and </p><p>culture, the absence of fathers that can foster </p><p>inappropriate and risky behavior in adolescent </p><p>daughters and sons, and generational </p><p>discontinuities that pull children away from </p><p>traditional norms that were still strong during </p><p>the upbringings of today\'s adults.  He strongly </p><p>urged the participants to "dialog with the </p><p>culture" and learn how to communicate with young </p><p>people if they are to be successful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Joining the workshop in Kaduna during a </p><p>session on its second day was Dr. Danny McCain, </p><p>an American faculty member in the Department of </p><p>Religious Studies at the University of Jos.  (All </p><p>primary and secondary students in Nigeria take </p><p>"Christian Religious Knowledge" or "Islamic </p><p>Religious Knowledge" as a required course.)  The </p><p>Religious Studies department at the university </p><p>trains teachers in these subjects for primary and </p><p>secondary schools.  The Muslim and Christian </p><p>faculty at the Department worked together to </p><p>develop two exactly parallel AIDS awareness </p><p>syllabi for high school religious studies </p><p>classes.  The learning outcomes and lesson </p><p>sequences are identical for both the Christian </p><p>and Islamic syallabi; the only difference is the </p><p>references to verses in the Bible or the Koran. </p><p>McCain shared the faculty\'s commitment to </p><p>education for abstinence and fidelity as the </p><p>behavioral premises of the program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Materials provided by Rivers for the </p><p>conference were all new to the participants. </p><p>They included the 1999 four-part series on AIDS </p><p>in Africa that ran in the Boston Globe; the </p><p>recent New Republic article ("Uganda v. Condoms: </p><p>Sex Change," by Arthur Allen, issue of May 27, </p><p>2000); and The Seymour Institute report, </p><p>"Recommendations for Addressing the AIDS </p><p>Holocaust in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1/2002."  The </p><p>IRCs added more material, including the Heritage </p><p>Foundation 5/2002 report on abstinence programs </p><p>that research has proven effective in reducing </p><p>sexual activity among young people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The final sessions of the workshops were </p><p>devoted to brainstorming.  The Nigerian </p><p>participants proved eager to:  begin developing </p><p>awareness campaigns and workshops; develop </p><p>community-based non-academic approaches and </p><p>materials; train trainers; develop effective </p><p>communications; and put together an advocacy </p><p>network to promote abstinence and fidelity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  In addition to the workshops, Rivers held </p><p>media roundtables in Lagos and Abuja.  The </p><p>National Television Authority and Federal Radio </p><p>Corporation of Nigeria aired spots of the Kaduna </p><p>session -- one ran seven minutes.  Reports were </p><p>printed over the weekend in two newspapers -- The </p><p>Guardian (establishment, Lagos) and Al-Mizan. </p><p>The latter is a radical Islamic paper published </p><p>in Zaria that circulates to Mosque congregations </p><p>on Friday.  The report of the Rivers program was </p><p>the first favorable report on the U.S. in the </p><p>newspaper in recent memory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  At a dinner with Rivers, the Methodist </p><p>bishop of Kaduna confessed that he has never met </p><p>an AIDS patient, and the dinner table </p><p>conversation about the coming crisis of millions </p><p>of orphans in Africa was the first time he had </p><p>considered this need for enlarged social work. </p><p>(He said the two Methodist orphanages in Nigeria </p><p>have a capacity of a few hundred, and it is </p><p>already a financial challenge to maintain them. </p><p>To his knowledge, these are the only Christian </p><p>orphanages in the country.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  "Sixty Minutes" arranged for the Reuters </p><p>office in Abidjan to send a cameraman to tape </p><p>Rivers\' initial workshop sessions on Thursday, </p><p>June 6.  The cameraman did not interview Rivers, </p><p>the participants, or any Consulate staff.  Action </p><p>for this project at "Sixty Minutes" is Dana </p><p>Miller. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  GPRA data: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RESULTS:  Excellent.  Participants rated the </p><p>workshops as highly successful and left full of </p><p>information and energy to strengthen the </p><p>"abstinence" and "be faithful" portions of their </p><p>own programs.  The fortuitous attendance of Dr. </p><p>McCain allowed them to be updated on one Nigerian </p><p>effort that is already underway.  Fresh materials </p><p>provided by Rev. Rivers and the IRC added new </p><p>knowledge and perspectives.  The participation of </p><p>Muslim and Christian leaders, focusing on a </p><p>common problem, was an additional positive </p><p>dimension of the program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DATE:  June 3-7, 2002, FY 2002, third quarter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MPP UMBRELLA THEMES:  Health </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AUDIENCE REACHED:  Sixty HIV/AIDS activists and </p><p>program leaders drawn from both Nigeria\'s north </p><p>and south.  Attending all the sessions in Lagos </p><p>over two days was the First Lady of Cross River </p><p>State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NON-USG FUNDING:  N/A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUALITY OF U.S. SUPPORT:  Excellent.  Thanks to </p><p>William Peters of IIP for making travel </p><p>arrangements for Rev. Rivers on short notice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
