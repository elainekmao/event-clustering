<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001942 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: POSTPONING NIGERIA\'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1323 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1033 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON:  1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nigeria\'s Local Government Council </p><p>elections, slated for August 10, will almost certainly be </p><p>postponed to October or later.  Different actors have </p><p>different specific reasons and interests, but it all boils </p><p>down to lack of preparation and lack of presidential interest </p><p>in seeing the local elections move forward -- the same issues </p><p>that led to the May polls being delayed.  If the further </p><p>postponement helps players organize, prospects for a </p><p>relatively smooth electoral cycle are enhanced.  But if delay </p><p>encourages further confrontation and leaves key issues open, </p><p>the future will look less rosy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Nigeria\'s Local Government Council elections, slated </p><p>for August 10, following an initial postponement from May 18 </p><p>(ref A), are likely to be delayed again, this time until at </p><p>least October and probably until December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We come to this conclusion following a dozen-plus </p><p>conversations with political actors, ranging from the Vice </p><p>President to state-level political operatives for several of </p><p>the parties.  The expectation that the polls will be delayed </p><p>is nearly unanimous, and most expect them not to hold before </p><p>December.  Moreover, the newly-registered parties (septel) </p><p>are threatening to go to court to demand a delay on the </p><p>grounds that the current schedule, which would force them to </p><p>field candidates across the Federation within the next three </p><p>weeks,  is constitutionally deficient.  Seasoned observers </p><p>tell us this argument could prevail but that the political </p><p>consensus in favor of postponement is strong enough that the </p><p>higher courts probably will never see any lawsuit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Following are some reasons further delay is likely: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- It advances President Obasanjo\'s objective of collapsing </p><p>the election schedule into the shortest possible period of </p><p>time (all other things being equal, a short cycle would favor </p><p>his candidacy. In his ideal world, Obasanjo would hold the </p><p>Presidential election first, followed closely by the other </p><p>contests.  This would compel PDP state and local candidates </p><p>to campaign almost as much for him as for themselves because </p><p>their fate would be linked to his;  (C) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- It suits the purposes of National Assembly Members, most </p><p>of whom do not get along well with their governors and who </p><p>fear that early local government elections will strengthen </p><p>the governors at their expense;  (SBU) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Great confusion over the legal status of local governments </p><p>created by some states after May 1999 (ref B) makes it almost </p><p>impossible to hold credible polls in those states;  (U) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Several states do not have laws authorizing them to carry </p><p>out elections;  (U) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Most states that do have laws probably have not set aside </p><p>funds for the election and current revenue flows will not </p><p>provide enough money to run the exercise and meet other state </p><p>spending priorities;  (U) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The majority of the states lack trained personnel and </p><p>sufficient equipment and supplies;  (U) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The new political parties will create public pressure for </p><p>postponement, and their supporters could resort to violence </p><p>if they feel the deck is stacked against them;  (U) and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Constitution and state laws aside, existing Federal </p><p>electoral laws favor the stance of the new parties.  (U). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The PDP is organizationally ready to hold primaries, </p><p>according to Chairman Audu Ogbeh, but most party leaders are </p><p>inclined to support a delay.  However, many state governors, </p><p>hoping to use the new local governments as future campaign </p><p>machines, would be unhappy with another delay and could well </p><p>seek incumbency pacts in return for quietly assenting to </p><p>another postponement.  We believe that some tacit incumbency </p><p>pacts are already in place, particularly in the Southwest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In other words, a majority of the players are not </p><p>ready to head to the polls.  This is the same reason polls </p><p>were initially delayed from May 18 to August 10.  This time </p><p>the actors have the opportunity to use the delay effectively. </p><p> Now that the new parties have been officially recognized </p><p>they must solidify their support bases and prepare for the </p><p>upcoming elections. The new parties have had a foretaste of </p><p>possible victory by following procedures and going through </p><p>proper channels.  If the process continues in this vein, then </p><p>the chances for free and fair elections in the year ahead </p><p>increase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) However a delay in the elections gives those so </p><p>inclined ample time to find new ways to manipulate or stymie </p><p>the process.  Many of the actors are not convinced that </p><p>"playing by the rules" is in their best interest, and cannot </p><p>be expected to do so.  If the methods of these actors </p><p>prevail, then the legitimacy of the election process is still </p><p>very much in doubt. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
