NATSIOS VISIT </p><p>TO NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>I.  SUMMARY: </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Mr. Andrew S. Natsios, Administrator, visited </p><p>Abuja, Nigeria, from November 18-21, 2002.  Mr. </p><p>Natsios was accompanied by Ms. Kate Almquist, Special </p><p>Assistant and Mr. Greg Loos, Education Team Leader, </p><p>EGAT. The purpose of the Administrator\'s visit to </p><p>Nigeria was to attend the Global Education For All </p><p>Initiative (EFA) Second High-level Group Meeting, </p><p>chaired by the UNESCO Director-General and hosted by </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo.  Mr. Natsios met the key </p><p>government and political leadership of Nigeria, </p><p>including President Obasanjo, National Security </p><p>Advisor, the Minister of Education, Chairman of the </p><p>Nigerian Action Committee on AIDS (NACA), Special </p><p>Advisor on Budgetary Matters, Representatives of </p><p>registered political parties, Representatives of </p><p>selected unregistered political associations, declared </p><p>and undeclared candidates contesting the upcoming </p><p>elections, Chairman of the Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission, and non-governmental </p><p>organizations. He also met and briefed the press, </p><p>visited the USAID Nigeria office to meet and address </p><p>the staff, had talks over lunch with senior staff and </p><p>dinner with USDH and USPSC employees prior to </p><p>departure. We also managed to squeeze in a mini-tour </p><p>of Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The original program included a visit to Kano, </p><p>the largest city in northern Nigeria to view USAID </p><p>activities in HIV/AIDS, Education, Democracy and </p><p>Governance and Agriculture. However, this segment of </p><p>his program was superceded by a request for the </p><p>Administrator to meet with key Nigerian officials on </p><p>elections related issues.  In all of his meetings, the </p><p>Administrator stressed: 1) the need for an all parties </p><p>code of conduct denouncing electoral violence, 2) the </p><p>importance and expectation of conducting free, fair, </p><p>transparent and non-violent elections, 3) the 2003 </p><p>elections represent a watershed, would set a precedent </p><p>for Africa and would influence how the USG and other </p><p>donors viewed Nigeria, Africa as a whole and </p><p>initiatives such as NEPAD, 4) Nigeria would maintain a </p><p>leadership role in Africa by a successful transition </p><p>from one civilian government to another.  He also </p><p>voiced USG concern about election organizational </p><p>problems (perception that INEC is inadequately </p><p>prepared due to lack of funding and slow pace of </p><p>logistical planning.  Finally, he inquired about what </p><p>assistance the USG could provide to enhance the </p><p>credibility of the electoral process and ensure </p><p>successful elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) This was Administrator Natisos? first trip to </p><p>Nigeria.  Mr. Natsios? visit with the key political </p><p>players was productive and his meetings elicited </p><p>general support for a code of conduct, GON promise to </p><p>adequately fund INEC, and a promise from INEC to </p><p>reopen voter registration. Moreover, the visit </p><p>underscored for some key actors Washington\'s interest </p><p>in a fair, peaceful contest. He departed Abuja on </p><p>November 21, 2002, as scheduled and without incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>II. Education For All (EFA) High-Level Group Meeting </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The EFA Second High-level Group Meeting was </p><p>held at the Congress Hall of the Abuja NICON Hilton </p><p>hotel from November 19-21.  The meeting was opened by </p><p>President Olusegan Obasanjo and assisted by the </p><p>Nigerian Minister of Education.  Mr. Koichiro </p><p>Matsuura, Director-General of UNESCO, delivered the </p><p>welcome address and video-taped goodwill messages from </p><p>James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, and </p><p>Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF, were </p><p>played. Participants at the meeting included Ministers </p><p>of Education from Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa </p><p>and the Middle East.  United Nations organizations, </p><p>the EU, World Bank and USAID made up the list of </p><p>multilateral and bilateral organizations, as well as </p><p>the participation of several international non- </p><p>governmental organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The expected outcomes of the meeting were: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> a)  to assess the progress toward the achievement </p><p>of the Dakar goals including discussion on major </p><p>issues deriving from the global EFA monitoring report; </p><p> b)  evaluate the extent to which national </p><p>policies, plans and programs are on track; </p><p> c)  evalute the extent to which international </p><p>commitments made in Dakar are being met; and, </p><p> d)  mobilize global political support and </p><p>resources for realizing EFA goals to eliminate gender </p><p>disparities in primary and secondary education by </p><p>2005. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Administrator Natsios presented remarks during </p><p>the session on International Commitments and </p><p>Initiatives.  He stated that there has been a 90% </p><p>increase for education at USAID over the past 3 years </p><p>($100 million to $195 million) and a 25% increase for </p><p>education in Africa. USAID will not invest in a </p><p>country if:  a) it is not democratic, b) it is itself </p><p>not investing in education (as measured by the % of </p><p>national budget going to ed), c) the money will be </p><p>wasted (corruption), d) systems of quality control are </p><p>not in place, and e) the country is only focused on </p><p>inputs, not results. He also stated he was pleased </p><p>that the U.S. has rejoined UNCESO, and supports the </p><p>work UNESCO is doing in data collection and analysis. </p><p>Finally, he emphasized the importance of partnerships </p><p>with the private sector:  religious (Mission Schools, </p><p>Koranic Schools), business, foundations, (i.e. the </p><p>Gates Foundation).  In his final remarks, the </p><p>Administrator informed the audience about the Global </p><p>Development Alliance (GDA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In an informal one-on-one exchange with the </p><p>Nigerian Minister of Education, Professor Abraham </p><p>Babalola Borishade wanted to clarify that data </p><p>reported on Nigeria is not always accurate, or </p><p>reflects the whole picture.  For example, the 7% </p><p>figure quoted as budgeted for education from the </p><p>national budget, does not take into consideration </p><p>state and local government inputs which are </p><p>substantial for primary education.  The Minister also </p><p>explained the FGN has other important priorities (i.e. </p><p>provision of clean water, electricity and good road, </p><p>thus it could not devote more to education).  The </p><p>Minister stressed that Nigeria has made progress in </p><p>the past few years on school construction and </p><p>implementation of UBE.  Finally, the Minister wanted </p><p>to speak on behalf of other developing nations to </p><p>impress upon the donors the importance of their making </p><p>good on their promises made at the first HLG meeting </p><p>in Dakar. Administrator Natsios reiterated points made </p><p>above but made clear that Nigeria will not be </p><p>forgotten by the U.S.  Mention was also made of the </p><p>new Presidential Initiative on Basic Education, and </p><p>that Nigeria is one of its first beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>III. Meetings With Nigerian Officials </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Ambassador Jeter hosted a breakfast meeting </p><p>and invited Dr. Babatunde Oshotimehin, Chairman, </p><p>Nigerian Action Committee on AIDS and Mrs. Oby </p><p>Ezekwesili, Special Advisior to the President on </p><p>Budgetary Matters. Mrs. Ezekwesili stated that the </p><p>budget presented by the President to the National </p><p>Assembly has 45% shortfall, primarily due to reduction </p><p>of resources because of decrease in OPEC allocation. </p><p>Also funds were not being realized from the </p><p>privatization program. Mrs. Ezekwesili explained the </p><p>Nigerian budget process, provided other reasons for </p><p>the shortfall, and plans to monetize civil service </p><p>benefits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) HIV/AIDS ? Dr. Babatunde Oshotimehin: </p><p>current national average HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is </p><p>5.6% with some states having a rate as high as 15%. </p><p>The aids budget is 20-30% of Ministry of Health\'s </p><p>total budget.  Nigeria is participating in multi- </p><p>country World Bank fund (credit scheme) to address </p><p>prevention efforts and care and treatment, and </p><p>assistance to people already infected.  Nigeria has </p><p>developed and is implementing its HIV/AIDS policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Meetings were held with representatives of </p><p>the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the newly </p><p>registered National Democratic Party (NDP) and five </p><p>unregistered political associations awaiting </p><p>registration.  Former Senator Safana, PDP Deputy </p><p>National Chairman said the political parties were </p><p>committed to non-violent elections. The other parties </p><p>echoed the same sentiment, but criticized the </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission?s (INEC) </p><p>performance. On the issue of a code of conduct for </p><p>politicians, some party representatives commented that </p><p>enough enforcement laws have been enacted but </p><p>enforcement has been lax. All parties stated that they </p><p>would sign a code of conduct. However, some opposition </p><p>party members claimed that violence could spring from </p><p>the strong desire of unpopular incumbents to be </p><p>reelected at all costs, including rigging the vote </p><p>count, and using hired thugs to intimidate opponents </p><p>and voters. Each party stated they would renounce </p><p>violence, but admitted that violence was a </p><p>possibility.  One opposition party member stated that </p><p>faced with the use of force by the incumbent </p><p>candidates and parties, the opposition would be </p><p>foolish to tie itself to a code of conduct. All groups </p><p>voiced concern that large segments of the population </p><p>were not able to register and they believed it was due </p><p>to INEC\'s lack of planning and also misconduct by INEC </p><p>officials and politicians.  The AP and AD members felt </p><p>that since PDP was the majority party, PDP elected </p><p>officials had access to government resources that put </p><p>other parties at a disadvantage when it came to </p><p>campaigning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) November 20, - meeting with President </p><p>Obasanjo.  After a quick overview of USAID\'s programs </p><p>and presence in Nigeria, the Administrator raised the </p><p>USG\'s major concerns regarding the status of the </p><p>Nigerian electoral process, stressing the need for a </p><p>code of conduct and the need to adequately fund INEC. </p><p>The President responded positively on both issues.  On </p><p>the matter of the code of conduct, the National </p><p>Assembly had failed to pass the anti-electoral </p><p>violence bill, but he would re-submit the legislation. </p><p>The President said that he had approved the entire 27 </p><p>billion Naira election budget that INEC had presented </p><p>to conduct the elections. The Ministry of Finance has </p><p>been authorized to expedite the funds to INEC. The </p><p>President promised that he would work to ensure the </p><p>elections were credible and fair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) November 20, 14:00 - during a meeting with </p><p>INEC Chairman Guobadia, and Secretary General Baba- </p><p>Ahmed, Administrator Natsios focused on voter </p><p>registration, and INEC\'s budget and logistic </p><p>preparations.  INEC officials disagreed with the </p><p>claims that voter registration missed up to half of </p><p>the eligible voters, but did admit that there were </p><p>flaws in the exercise including the theft of </p><p>registrations forms. INEC said they would reopen the </p><p>registration. With the approval of the election </p><p>budget, INEC hoped to begin to order essential </p><p>material and further its logistical planning. On the </p><p>matter of additional assistance, the Secretary General </p><p>presented USAID a letter outlining INEC assistance </p><p>needs for the elections.  INEC was supportive of a </p><p>code of conduct, but said the onus was with the </p><p>parties. However, INEC would encourage the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Meeting with the National Security Advisor, </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, he believed that a code of </p><p>conduct would have minimal impact since various party </p><p>constitutions incorporate similar statements. He hoped </p><p>INEC could accelerate its logistical planning and </p><p>acquisition of needed electoral materials.  On the </p><p>question of violence and the impact on a visit by the </p><p>U.S. President, he was confident that there would be </p><p>no reason for the President not to come. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Meeting with PDP Board of Trustee Chairman </p><p>and Former Vice President, Alex Ekwueme.  Mr. Alex </p><p>Ekwueme was mildly supportive of a code of conduct, as </p><p>it was only as good as the commitment of those who </p><p>signed it. He believed the key to reducing political </p><p>tension and the potential for violence was to convince </p><p>unpopular incumbents not to seek re-election.  When </p><p>asked if he planned to contest, he answered, "he had </p><p>not made up his mind."  (Note:  since the meeting, Mr. </p><p>Ekwueme has declared himself to be a candidate for </p><p>President on the PDP ticket. End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Meeting with PDP hopeful Senator Nwachukwu. </p><p>Senator Nwachukwu blamed the violence on the </p><p>determination of incumbents to succeed themselves.  He </p><p>was non-committal on a public signing of a code of </p><p>conduct and suggested that the USG could be most </p><p>helpful by ensuring sufficient numbers of </p><p>international election monitors during the caucus and </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) In a meeting with former President Yakubu </p><p>Gowon, Administrator Natsios asked about the </p><p>performance of INEC. The former President cited the </p><p>experience of family members? inability to register </p><p>during the September voter registration exercise due </p><p>to lack of materials. On the issue of a code of </p><p>conduct, he responded that the most important thing is </p><p>for government and politicians to play by the rules. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) Meeting with USAID partners:  Pastor James </p><p>Wuye and Imam Mohammed Nuralyn Ashafa, of the </p><p>Muslim/Christian Dialogue Forum.  The meeting, held at </p><p>USAID, centered on how the two began working together, </p><p>their religious background, and a description of </p><p>conflict prevention activities they are actively </p><p>engaged in now.  The Administrator provided </p><p>information on conflict activities that USAID is </p><p>implementing in Europe and in Africa.  He said that </p><p>the mission should take a look at the Bosnia and South </p><p>Africa Sesame Street activities to determine if these </p><p>kinds of programs might be modified for use in </p><p>Nigeria.  The Administrator said that the mission </p><p>should work closely with the Agency\'s Conflict office </p><p>to: (1) design an activity that would allow us to air </p><p>a weekly radio program hosted by the Pastor and the </p><p>Imam; (2) do a case study on the Pastor and Imam </p><p>because he believed that the lessons learned would be </p><p>useful to other missions in conflict areas and (3) </p><p>locate a school where the Pastor and Imam could </p><p>upgrade their conflict/peace building skills. </p><p>Following the meeting, the Administrator stressed that </p><p>this had been one of his best meetings in Nigeria </p><p>because he had the opportunity to meet ordinary people </p><p>who were trying to bring peace to their country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) During dinner discussions the USDH staff </p><p>Administrator Natsios was advised that USAID/Nigeria </p><p>had received funding for three (3) GDA activities. </p><p>The Administrator asked whether the GDA manual was </p><p>useful in designing activities.  The response was </p><p>while it was useful in clarifying some issues, the </p><p>mission still needed more guidance from USAID/W on the </p><p>contractual and legal aspects of implementing the </p><p>program.  A list of the issues not covered in the </p><p>manual will be sent to USAID/W for possible inclusion </p><p>into the GDA manual.  Another topic discussed was the </p><p>leveraging funds from the Nigerian diaspora. </p><p>Leveraging of funds is currently being done in the E&E </p><p>bureau and within the Asian community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) At the same dinner meeting, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>informed Administrator Natsios that he believed that </p><p>the mission needs to bring in additional help for the </p><p>elections.  He said that a "domestic monitor" expert </p><p>is needed for about a month to work with our </p><p>international partners and other donors to get this </p><p>process on track.  The ambassador also said that there </p><p>is a need to bring in someone with "elections" skills </p><p>who could dedicate 100% of his or her time to working </p><p>on the elections with the donors and INEC.  The </p><p>Administrator informed Ambassador Jeter that USAID </p><p>would consider such a request and explore ways to be </p><p>responsive. USAID will ascertain from Ambassador Jeter </p><p>specifics on timing and other relevant information </p><p>before contacting the Administrator.  In the interim, </p><p>the mission is contacting the DG center to determine </p><p>the availability of USDH staff with the requisite </p><p>skills, or if outside assistance must be procured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U) For your information, the embassy is drafting </p><p>classified cables of the meetings held with GON </p><p>officials. As soon as they are transmitted I will </p><p>advise you of the date and number. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
