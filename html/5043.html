<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IZ, PREL, TU, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH FOREIGN TRADE UNDERSECRETARIAT ON </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL DELEGATION TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a January 9 meeting on sensitive Turkish exports to </p><p>Iraq (septel), Econoff raised State Minister Kursad Tuzmen\'s </p><p>upcoming visit to Iraq (January 10 to 12) with Tevfik Mengu, </p><p>Director General for Agreements at the Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat.  Mengu, who will travel with the </p><p>delegation, acknowledged that the visit was "purely </p><p>commercial", though he did not rule out that Tuzmen might </p><p>bring a political message to Saddam Hussein.  He said that, </p><p>at last count, 324 businesspersons planned to fly with the </p><p>GOT delegation, and that more would be traveling by bus. </p><p>Econoff pointed out that this high-level visit comes at a </p><p>time when we are trying to increase pressure on Baghdad to </p><p>comply with UN Security Council resolutions.  Mengu responded </p><p>that Turkey was not doing anything contrary to UN </p><p>resolutions, but only seeking legitimate business for its </p><p>companies.  He added that, in meeting GOI officials, the GOT </p><p>had always taken care to reiterate the message that Iraq must </p><p>comply with all UN resolutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Tuzmen told the press January 9 that his trip was a </p><p>routine effort to take a share in upcoming tenders under the </p><p>Oil for Food Program.  He added that he had obtained the UN\'s </p><p>consent for this visit (sic). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Emin Sirin, the Deputy Chairman of Parliament\'s </p><p>Foreign Policy </p><p>Committee, confirmed to us January 8 that TGS briefers nodded </p><p>their heads when he strongly criticized the Tuzmen trip </p><p>during a January 6 closed briefing for his committee on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  Tuzmen\'s claim that the GOT is trying to </p><p>develop legitimate trade through this and other visits does </p><p>not accord with the fact that the vast majority of Turkish </p><p>trade takes place under bilateral trade arrangements outside </p><p>the Oil-for-Food program.  It is hard to correlate the </p><p>structure of this trade mission with the "delivery of a </p><p>message", which we were originally told was the genesis of </p><p>this trip. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
