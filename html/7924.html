<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH TREASURY RAISES NEXT STEPS ON $1 BILLION </p><p>AID </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On May 8, Treasury Deputy Undersecretary Aydin </p><p>Karaoz raised with Acting DCM the next steps on effecting the </p><p>$1 billion in U.S. assistance for Turkey.  Karaoz said he had </p><p>just returned from the annual EBRD meeting in Tashkent, where </p><p>he had briefly discussed the issue with Treasury U/S Taylor. </p><p>Karaoz said the GOT needed USG guidance on how to proceed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Acting DCM said that, while he had not </p><p>instructions from Washington, the logical next step would be </p><p>for the GOT to communicate officially its need for the </p><p>assistance, and its desire to begin talks.  Following that, </p><p>the two side could meet in Washington, so the U.S. side could </p><p>explain the terms and conditions in the Financial Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Karaoz said he would consult with MinState Babacan </p><p>and provide the GOT view, probably next week.  He also raised </p><p>four specific questions.  What is our timing for the first </p><p>disbursement?  Is the northern Iraq cooperation condition a </p><p>one-time upfront condition precedent or is it a condition for </p><p>each disbursement?  Would a USG team be willing to come to </p><p>Ankara rather than a GOT team go to Washington?  And does the </p><p>U.S. offer give the GOT the flexibility to choose the </p><p>grant/loan mix the GOT wants, subject to the $8/5 billion </p><p>cap? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Action request:  Embassy requests guidance from </p><p>Washington agencies on the GOT questions. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
