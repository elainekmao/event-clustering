<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 02455 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: THE BEAT GOES ON: MASS PROTEST ACTIONS PROLIFERATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) PRETORIA 1985, (B) JOHANNESBURG 156, </p><p>     (C) PRETORIA 1310, (D) PRETORIA 1311 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE LEVEL OF PROTEST ACTION CONTINUES TO RISE IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF PRESIDENT DE KLERK\'S FEBRUARY 2 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>SPEECH.  A GROWING NUMBER OF BLACK COMMUNITIES HAVE </p><p>ORGANIZED RALLIES AROUND LOCAL ISSUES, WHILE THE REBEL </p><p>CRICKET TOUR AND THE UNBANNING OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE </p><p>PROVIDE A NEW FOCUS OF ACTIVITY.  MOST DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>CARRY A PALPABLE RISK OF CONFRONTATION AND VIOLENCE </p><p>BETWEEN POLICE AND PROTESTERS, OR BETWEEN PARTICIPATING </p><p>ANTI-APARTHEID FACTIONS.  THIS TENSION PREVAILS AT THE </p><p>VERY TIME PRETORIA IS UNDER PRESSURE TO RELEASE MANDELA </p><p>(SURE TO ROCKET BLACK ENTHUSIASM) AND REMOVE THE STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY IN FULL. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE PRETORIA-JOHANNESBURG AREA ALONE, AT LEAST 5 </p><p>RALLIES TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE PAST WEEK.  THIS DOES NOT </p><p>COUNT THE PROTEST ACTIONS SURROUNDING THE REBEL BRITISH </p><p>CRICKET TOUR WHICH IS ATTRACTING ALMOST DAILY PROTESTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ALEXANDRA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN PERHAPS THE LARGEST EVER DEMONSTRATION IN ALEXANDRA </p><p>(NORTHERN JOHANNESBURG), AN ESTIMATED 50,000 RESIDENTS LED </p><p>BY THE ALEXANDRA CIVIC ORGANIZATION MARCHED ON FEBRUARY 3 </p><p>FROM THE LOCAL STADIUM TO THE CITY COUNCIL OFFICES AND THE </p><p>POLICE STATION TO PRESENT PETITIONS.  EVEN BEFORE WINNIE </p><p>MANDELA APPEARED ON THE SCENE, THE DEMONSTRATION HAD </p><p>BECOME VOCIFEROUSLY AN ANC UNBANNING CELEBRATION.  THE </p><p>POLICE MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ATTERIDGEVILLE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE ATTERIDGEVILLE-SAULSVILLE RESIDENTS ORGANIZATION </p><p>(ASRO) SPONSORED AND DIRECTED A SIMILAR EXERCISE IN MASS </p><p>MOBILIZATION THE NEXT DAY (FEBRUARY 4) OUTSIDE PRETORIA. </p><p>SOME 60-80,000 RESIDENTS JOINED THE MARCH TO LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES WHERE A PETITION WAS DELIVERED GIVING </p><p>THE CITY COUNCILLORS ONE MONTH TO ADDRESS A MYRIAD OF </p><p>TOWNSHIP GRIEVANCES (RENT INCREASES, EVICTIONS, </p><p>MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS, ETC.). </p><p> </p><p>6.  AGAIN, ANC SYMPATHIZERS DOMINATED THE GATHERING; ONLY </p><p>ANC, SACP, UDF, COSATU, AND SWAPO BANNERS WERE IN </p><p>EVIDENCE.  PARTICIPANTS WHO APPEARED WITH T-SHIRTS BEARING </p><p>AZAPO (BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS) OR PAM/PAC (AFRICANIST) LOGOS </p><p>WERE SUMMARILY TOLD TO REVERSE THE SHIRT OR GO HOME. </p><p> </p><p>7.  POLICE AT TIMES SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO PROVOKE A </p><p>CONFLICT AS THEIR VEHICLES SPED RECKLESSLY THROUGH THE </p><p>THRONGS OF PROTESTERS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  THE PEOPLE, </p><p>WHO HAD BEEN WARNED AGAINST SUCH PROVOCATIONS BY COMMUNITY </p><p>LEADERS RETREATED TO NEARBY YARDS TO AVOID INJURY. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>TEMBISA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  VIOLENCE ERUPTED IN TEMBISA (OUTSIDE JOHANNESBURG) </p><p>DURING A FEBRUARY 5 PROTEST CALLED BY LOCAL MASS </p><p>DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT LEADERS.  A PETITION DELIVERED TO </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED FOR AN END TO THE STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY AND RESTRICTION ORDERS ON 20 TEMBISA ACTIVISTS, </p><p>LOWER RENTAL RATES, AND THE RESIGNATION OF THREE SECONDARY </p><p>SCHOOL PRINCIPALS.  APPARENTLY, YOUNG DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>ATTACKED NON-PARTICIPANTS IN THE ANNOUNCED STAYAWAY, WHICH </p><p>BROUGHT RETALIATORY POLICE ACTION.  SEVEN PEOPLE WERE </p><p>SERIOUSLY INJURED BY POLICE TEARGAS CANISTERS AND </p><p>BIRDSHOT. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>GARANKUWA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  ABOUT 70,000 PEOPLE ON FEBRUARY 7 MARCHED TO LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN GARANKUWA, SOME 30 MILES NORTHWEST </p><p>OF PRETORIA INSIDE BOPHUTHATSWANA.  THE PETITION LODGED BY </p><p>COMMUNITY LEADERS FOCUSED AGAIN ON LOCAL GRIEVANCES (E.G., </p><p>HIGH RENT AND SERVICES BILLS), BUT ALSO CALLED FOR THE </p><p>RESIGNATION OF BOPHUTHATSWANA PRESIDENT MANGOPE\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE REINCORPORATION OF THE "INDEPENDENT" </p><p>HOMELAND INTO SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AGAIN, CHARTERIST-ORIENTED GROUPS PROVIDED THE BULK </p><p>OF MARCHERS, THOUGH A FEW STEVE BIKO (BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS) </p><p>POSTERS COULD BE SEEN HELD HIGH.  THE BOPHUTHATSWANA </p><p>POLICE, TOO, WERE PLAYING A FAMILIAR ROLE, TRYING </p><p>(UNSUCCESSFULLY) TO SEAL OFF THE PROTEST ROUTE.  IN </p><p>FRUSTRATION NEAR THE END OF A LONG DAY, SEVERAL GROUPS OF </p><p>POLICE FIRED TEAR GAS AND BIRDSHOT INTO THE DISPERSING </p><p>CROWD, HARMING AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE.  AT ANOTHER POINT </p><p>A POLICE VEHICLE SPED INTO A GROUP KILLING ONE PERSON, AND </p><p>SERIOUSLY INJURING SEVERAL OTHERS.  DESPITE THESE POLICE </p><p>ACTIONS, THE DEMONSTRATION REMAINED GENERALLY PEACEFUL. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SOWETO CELEBRATION OF ANC UNBANNING </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVITED TO ATTEND THE UDF-AFFILIATED </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN YOUTH CONGRESS (SAYCO) RALLY IN SOWETO ON </p><p>SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 11 TO CELEBRATE THE ANC\'S UNBANNING.  WE </p><p>SUSPECT OTHER LOCATIONS WILL HAVE SIMILAR RALLIES IN THE </p><p>DAYS AHEAD, BUILDING TO A CRESCENDO FOR MANDELA\'S RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  STEADY AS SHE GOES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE TOWNSHIP MOBILIZATION TACTICS ADOPTED BY THE </p><p>CHARTERIST-LED OPPOSITION ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE SAG IN THIS PERIOD OF NASCENT DIALOGUE. </p><p>THESE ACTIONS HOLD SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR VIOLENT </p><p>CONFRONTATION EITHER WITH THE AUTHORITIES OR, CONCEIVABLY, </p><p>WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT.  SUCH A </p><p>VIOLENT OUTBREAK, DEPENDING ON ITS SCALE, COULD DELAY THE </p><p>SAG\'S TIMETABLE FOR TAKING ADDITIONAL STEPS TOWARD </p><p>NEGOTIATION, LIKE THE RELEASE OF MANDELA AND THE LIFTING </p><p>OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY.  YET, THESE MAY BE THE VERY </p><p>MEASURES REQUIRED TO GET "TALKS ABOUT TALKS" OFF THE </p><p>GROUND.  WHILE THE OPPOSITION PONDERS ITS RESPONSE TO DE </p><p>KLERK\'S BREATH-TAKING PARLIAMENTARY SPEECH (SEPTEL), WE </p><p>WONDER IF THE SAG ALSO FEELS THE SQUEEZE.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
