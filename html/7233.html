<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, CU, GT, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA STILL NON-COMMITTAL ON UNHRC CUBA </p><p>RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 86002 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Edgar </p><p>Gutierrez on April 3, and raised reftel talking points </p><p>requesting GOG co-sponsorhip of a UNHRC resolution on Cuba. </p><p>The Ambassador noted that, to avoid unnecessary controversy, </p><p>the draft resolution presented by three Latin American </p><p>countries did not mention the human rights situation in Cuba, </p><p>but rather simply called on the Cuban Government to permit </p><p>the visit of the UNHRC\'s Special Representative.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that, in view of the recent arrest by Cuban </p><p>authorities of large numbers of dissidents and human rights </p><p>workers, it would be unconscionable for the world not to </p><p>stand up and call on the Cuban Government to permit the visit </p><p>of the UNHRC\'s Special Representative.  He appealed to </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez\'s own past as a human rights </p><p>worker, saying that human rights activists in Cuba depended </p><p>on the solidarity of their hemispheric counterparts, and not </p><p>to support this resolution would be to abandon those seeking </p><p>basic democratic rights in Cuba through peaceful means. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Foreign Minister Gutierrez said that the GOG was aware </p><p>of the arrest of large numbers of dissidents in Cuba.  He </p><p>said that Guatemalan-Cuban relations had strengthened in </p><p>2003, and that Guatemala hoped to use this improvement for </p><p>"constructive engagement" with Cuba on a number of issues, </p><p>including human rights.  He said the GOG believes past UNHRC </p><p>resolutions have been ineffective, and wants to consider </p><p>options that might produce better results.  The Ambassador </p><p>replied that Cuban Government intransigence should not be </p><p>used to justify abandonment of dissidents who were putting </p><p>their lives on the line for their democratic beliefs, and </p><p>pressed Gutierrez to give a more precise indication of how </p><p>the GOG is coming out on this issue.  Gutierrez took refuge </p><p>in saying the GOG has not made a decision on how it will </p><p>address the Cuba resolution at the UNHRC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PolOff delivered the demarche separately to Acting </p><p>Head of Multilateral Affairs at the MFA Silvia Corado on </p><p>April 3.  Corado was similarly non-committal. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  The arrest of Cuban dissidents has </p><p>embarrassed President Portillo and Foreign Minister </p><p>Gutierrez, who (pressured by FRG leader Rios Montt) are </p><p>inclined not to support the Cuba resolution this year -- </p><p>largely out of pique with us over decertification and our </p><p>perceived opposition to the Rios Montt presidential </p><p>candidacy, and in part because of their personal sympathies </p><p>with the Cuban revolution.  We have built a case in the press </p><p>and with local human rights NGO\'s for supporting the Cuban </p><p>dissidents, and are using that to keep pressure on the GOG in </p><p>the lead-up to the vote.  We expect the Cubans will also be </p><p>working hard to convince the GOG to support them -- Vice </p><p>President Reyes was seen Sunday showing the Cuban Minister of </p><p>Education around the colonial city of Antigua.  Co-sponsorhip </p><p>is a bridge too far, but a positive vote may not be out of </p><p>range. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
