(C) Detailed Kuwaiti production figures are unavailable </p><p>today, but total production is understood to remain above 2.4 </p><p>million barrels per day. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A senior KPC official confirmed today that all three </p><p>refineries of the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation (Mina </p><p>Al-Ahmadi, Mina Al-Abdulla and Shuaiba) have resumed full </p><p>operations and are refining some 915,000 barrels of oil per </p><p>day.  All three trains at the LPG plant are also operating </p><p>normally.  On March 21, KPC had reported that it had scaled </p><p>back operations to 625,000 bpd and closed one LPG train due </p><p>to the threat of missile attacks.  However, the KPC official </p><p>noted the firm\'s continuing nervousness over the security of </p><p>its refinery operations, particularly in the light of the </p><p>explosion of an Iraqi missile early in the morning of March </p><p>29 which caused some minor damage to a Kuwait City shopping </p><p>mall.  The shopping mall is less than 20 miles </p><p>north-northwest of the refinery complex. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
