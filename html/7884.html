<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002716 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN HIKES CONSUMER FUEL PRICES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2569 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary. The GOJ raised prices of oil derivatives </p><p>and by-products an average of four to eight per cent </p><p>effective May 7, 2003.  Finance Minister Marto and other </p><p>senior officials confirmed publicly and privately that this </p><p>was the first installment in a plan to raise consumer </p><p>prices of petroleum products to world levels -- exactly as </p><p>agreed with the United States last year.  Initial public </p><p>reaction to the decision has been muted.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The Cabinet decided on May 6 to raise consumer </p><p>prices of virtually all oil derivatives and by-products </p><p>effective May 7.  Price increases include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooking gas cylinders up from $3.53 to $4.23 </p><p>-- Gallon of regular petrol from $1.47 to $1.60 </p><p>-- Gallon of first-grade petrol (super) from $1.97 to $2.13 </p><p>-- Gallon of unleaded petrol from $2.27 to 2.40 </p><p>-- Gallon of kerosene and diesel from $0.64 to $0.69 </p><p>-- Metric Tons of fuel oil used in industries will rise </p><p>   from $108.57 to $115.62 </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Finance Minister Michel Marto told the press that </p><p>the government took the new measures "because all aid to </p><p>the Kingdom from the United States, Japan, and the European </p><p>Union is contingent on implementing our agreement with the </p><p>International Monetary Fund (IMF) calling for the </p><p>completion of reforms which started in Jordan in the past </p><p>years."  He added that when the government prepared the </p><p>2003 state budget it calculated the world market price for </p><p>oil at $26/barrel, but in the past four months Jordan had </p><p>to pay as much as $30 per barrel. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Reiterating points made by Prime Minister Abu </p><p>Ragheb to the press last week (ref), Marto said that this </p><p>was the first of a series of price increases that would </p><p>eliminate subsidies on oil products.  He said, for </p><p>instance, that a cylinder of gas costs at least $4.94 to </p><p>produce.  With annual sales of 24 million cylinders of gas </p><p>in the Kingdom, this means an annual loss of about $35.25 </p><p>million to the treasury.  Marto was quoted in al-Rai, the </p><p>leading Arabic daily, as saying, "The government will </p><p>gradually increase prices of oil products so that in three </p><p>years time there will be no more subsidies." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  In a May 7 meeting with ECON/C and a visiting U.S. </p><p>Treasury team examining Iraqi accounts in Jordan, Marto </p><p>elaborated that the Government\'s decision had been cleared </p><p>by the King.  He confirmed that it was the first step in </p><p>the plan described to the United States in November 2002 to </p><p>raise consumer prices of petroleum taxes to international </p><p>levels (including an appropriate tax) over a three-year </p><p>period.  He said this initial increase would generate </p><p>additional revenues of JD 4.5 million per month ($55 </p><p>million/year).  Additional increases would follow the </p><p>schedule given to the United States.  Marto said that when </p><p>he told the IMF mission chief about the price increases on </p><p>May 6, the staffer praised the decision as further evidence </p><p>of Jordan\'s ability to deliver on its commitments and meet </p><p>its IMF targets. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  In addition to the oil products price increase, </p><p>the cabinet authorized an increase from 2 to 4% in the </p><p>General Sales Tax (GST) rate applied to food and other </p><p>basic commodities.  The cabinet also approved imposition of </p><p>a 5% tax on interest income earned on bank accounts, which </p><p>had previously been tax-exempt.  Marto said this rate would </p><p>be raised to the income tax rate over time. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  Synchronized with the price increases, </p><p>the Public Transport Regulatory Commission raised fare </p><p>schedules for public transportation vehicles using diesel </p><p>and petrol fuel.  This is the fifth such increase in </p><p>consumer prices over the past three years.  Marto predicted </p><p>grumbling, but acceptance by the public, particularly in </p><p>the context of the economic fallout on Jordan of the war in </p><p>Iraq.  So far, we have seen no negative blow-back from the </p><p>decision on the streets or in the press, though there was a </p><p>run on filling stations overnight that led to long waiting </p><p>lines throughout the city. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  In post\'s considered opinion, the commitment </p><p>Jordan made in November to raise oil product prices to </p><p>world levels is solid.  In addition to the public </p><p>statements of the government\'s intention, this is a policy </p><p>of the King that will not change when governments or </p><p>ministers change.  Planning Minister Awadallah, an economic </p><p>policy confidant of the King, also told ECON/C on May 5 </p><p>that the King is completely on board with the policy of </p><p>eliminating fiscal distortions, including Jordan\'s </p><p>historical dependence on cheap oil, and will ensure that </p><p>this policy is implemented. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
