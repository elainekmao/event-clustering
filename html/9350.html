THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY\'S YEAR 2003 INVESTMENT CLIMATE </p><p>STATEMENT FOR YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT OF INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. 1.  Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p> </p><p>The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) is committed to </p><p>attracting foreign investors by improving its overall </p><p>investment climate.  To this end, it adopted a new policy of </p><p>uniform treatment for all investors, domestic and foreign. </p><p>The lead ROYG agency is the General Investment Authority </p><p>(GIA), established in March 1992, which has worked with the </p><p>World Bank\'s Foreign Investment Advisory service to update </p><p>Yemen\'s Investment law 22 of 1991 (as amended).  The </p><p>alternative Investment Law number 22 of 2002 was adopted by </p><p>parliament on June 2002 and signed by the president on July </p><p>20, 2002.  However, to date the law has not been </p><p>implemented.  Once implemented the new law will safeguard </p><p>all exemptions and benefits called for in the previous </p><p>investment law and shift the focus of the GIA from </p><p>regulation to registration and promotion.  The new law will </p><p>eliminate intervention of the GIA and other government </p><p>agencies in investment projects and gives wider freedom to </p><p>investors in running their projects. The new law will cancel </p><p>some legal provisions, which provided special exceptions for </p><p>investors from obtaining import and export licenses from the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade and also from paying relevant </p><p>stamp duties.   The new law will encourage local production </p><p>by reducing customs duties by 50 percent on imported raw </p><p>materials and 100 percent on raw materials produced locally </p><p>for agricultural and fisheries projects.  Finally, the new </p><p>law will cancel some tax categories.  The new investment law </p><p>falls under the government\'s financial, economic and </p><p>administrative reform program, intended to encourage foreign </p><p>investment. </p><p> </p><p>Under the new law 22 of 2002, the primary role of the GIA is </p><p>limited to registration and promotion of investment </p><p>opportunities.  The GIA provides potential investors with an </p><p>information packet that includes a copy of the investment </p><p>law, an investment guide summarizing GIA activities, and an </p><p>application form with instructions.  Packets may be obtained </p><p>from the promotion section, General Investment Authority, </p><p>P.O. Box 19022, Sanaa, Republic of Yemen (Phone:  967-1-262- </p><p>962/3 or 268-205; Fax:  967-1-262-964, E-mails: </p><p>mohdhussein@yahoo.com; website is:  www.giay.org. </p><p> </p><p>The GIA welcomes investment in all projects with the </p><p>exception of arms and explosive materials, industries that </p><p>could cause environmental disasters, banking and money </p><p>exchange activities, and wholesale and retail imports. </p><p>Investments in the exploration and production of oil, gas </p><p>and minerals are subject to special agreements (e.g., </p><p>production sharing agreements) under the authority of the </p><p>ministry of oil and mineral resources and do not fall within </p><p>the purview of the GIA.  Investment is open to Yemeni, Arab, </p><p>or foreign investors acting solely or in partnership on any </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>The investment law revision is part of a large ROYG economic </p><p>restructuring program, sponsored by the IMF and World Bank, </p><p>begun in 1995.  The broad objectives of the program have </p><p>been to stabilize the economy and stimulate sustainable </p><p>growth.  By and large, it has been successful, and the ROYG </p><p>will negotiate with the IMF after the April 2003 election </p><p>for a new three-year poverty reduction and growth facility </p><p>(PRGF) for 2003-2005.  Macroeconomic stabilization has been </p><p>achieved with the Yemeni rial stable and floating at market </p><p>rates at the range of (1 USD equaled approximately 174 YR </p><p>until October 2002; and 183 YR from October 2002-July 2003. </p><p>Inflation (as measured by the CPI) declined from 71 percent </p><p>in 1994 to 11. 8 percent in 2003, and foreign currency </p><p>reserves now reached USD 4.7 billion, or 17.6 months of </p><p>imports.  Most bilateral debt has been rescheduled under the </p><p>Paris Club and commercial debt has largely been eliminated </p><p>through a World Bank grant program.  External debt is now </p><p>about 48.7 percent of GDP as at March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Under the international financial institutions\' reform </p><p>programs, Yemen\'s trade environment has also improved, and </p><p>basic elements of a social safety net have been implemented. </p><p>A simplified and less protective tariff structure has been </p><p>initiated with the elimination of nearly all import bans, </p><p>export restrictions, and import licensing, and the adoption </p><p>of a unified tariff.  Under the new (investment) law 22 of </p><p>2002, duties applied on raw materials not available locally </p><p>will be exempted by 50 percent.  There will also be a full </p><p>exemption on imported materials included in agricultural and </p><p>fisheries projects.  Also as instructed by the president, </p><p>there should be a 100 percent exemption on lands in the </p><p>southern and eastern provinces if the project cost, </p><p>excluding land, is more than ten million dollars.  A </p><p>privatization program, begun in 1998 with sixteen </p><p>enterprises in industry, tourism, and trade, came to a </p><p>standstill in April 2001 when parliament refused to approve </p><p>a World Bank credit to fund a larger, long-term </p><p>privatization program.  Financial sector reform has advanced </p><p>with passage of a new law granting full independence to the </p><p>Central Bank.  Commercial banks have also been required to </p><p>improve their accounting procedures and loan recovery rates. </p><p>That said, the bank system remains weak, with most </p><p>commercial banks owned by families who have very low </p><p>capitalization rates. </p><p> </p><p>A.2. Conversion and Transfer Policies </p><p> </p><p>The Yemeni rial is freely convertible at market rates.  It </p><p>has been stable at the 176-177YR/1USD range through October </p><p>2002.  The rial went down to 182-183YR/1USD through the end </p><p>of the year, due partially to the impact of the attack on </p><p>the oil tanker M/V Limburg off the coast of Yemen.  All </p><p>other foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars, are </p><p>readily available and trade freely at market rates.  Under </p><p>Investment Law 22, investors may transfer funds in hard </p><p>currency from abroad to Yemen for the purpose of investment </p><p>and may re-export invested capital, whether in kind or in </p><p>cash, upon liquidation or project disposal.  Net profits </p><p>resulting from investment of foreign funds may be </p><p>transferred freely outside of Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>A.3. Expropriation and Compensation </p><p> </p><p>Yemen\'s investment law stipulates that projects will not be </p><p>nationalized or seized.  Moreover, the funds will not be </p><p>blocked, confiscated, frozen, withheld or sequestered by </p><p>other than a court of law.  Likewise, real estate may not be </p><p>expropriated except in the national interest, according to </p><p>the law and a court judgment, and against fair compensation </p><p>based on its market price on the issuance date of the court </p><p>judgment.  Such compensation may be freely transferred </p><p>abroad. </p><p> </p><p>Since Yemen\'s unification in 1990, there have been no cases </p><p>of property expropriation.  The ROYG recognizes that </p><p>expropriation (which existed in the socialist-led Peoples\' </p><p>Democratic Republic of Yemen, the former South Yemen, until </p><p>1990) is contrary to its economic reform aspirations.  Much </p><p>of the expropriated lands in the southern and eastern </p><p>provinces have been returned to the rightful owners.  Land </p><p>registration, however, is in its infancy in Yemen, and </p><p>disputes over both residential and commercial plots are </p><p>frequent and nearly impossible to adjudicate legally. </p><p> </p><p>A.4. Dispute Settlement </p><p> </p><p>There have been no significant investment disputes involving </p><p>U.S. investors over the past several years, although </p><p>commercial disputes are common.  Yemen signed the Convention </p><p>on the Settlement of Investment Disputes in 1997, but has </p><p>not yet ratified the New York Convention on Arbitration.  In </p><p>the interim, business disputes are generally handled by </p><p>informal arbitration or within Yemen\'s court system.  In </p><p>1998, a private arbitration center, the Yemeni Center for </p><p>Conciliation and Arbitration, was created by a group of </p><p>lawyers, bankers, and businessmen as an alternative to the </p><p>courts.  The center has settled a number of cases so far in </p><p>the areas of trade, finance, construction and industry, and </p><p>is gaining recognition as a viable alternative. </p><p> </p><p>The formal judicial system is widely regarded as inefficient </p><p>and corrupt.  While Yemen\'s investment-related laws are </p><p>basically sound, enforcement remains problematic at best and </p><p>nonexistent at worst.  The ROYG has special commercial </p><p>courts to provide a mechanism for commercial dispute </p><p>resolution, but they are generally considered ineffective. </p><p>In the fall of 2002, the GIA board of directors and the </p><p>council of ministers decided to establish specialized courts </p><p>for settlement of investment disputes with four appointed </p><p>judges.  To date these special courts has not been </p><p>established.  Bilateral and multilateral donors are actively </p><p>encouraging the ROYG to press forward with more extensive </p><p>judicial reforms. </p><p> </p><p>Most investors would be best served by establishing a </p><p>partnership with a Yemeni who knows the system, and by </p><p>including International arbitration clauses in their </p><p>contracts.  In cases involving interest, most judges use </p><p>Shari\'a (Islamic) law as the guideline, under which claims </p><p>for interest payments due are almost always rejected.  Local </p><p>commercial banks are sensitive to this problem, and rarely </p><p>lend to other than established, large trading houses for </p><p>this reason. </p><p> </p><p>A.5. Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p> </p><p>Under Yemen\'s investment law, no performance requirements </p><p>are specified as a condition for establishing, maintaining </p><p>or expanding investment.  Incentives include, but are not </p><p>limited to:  exemption from customs fees and taxes levied on </p><p>fixed assets of the project; tax holiday on profits for a </p><p>period of seven years, renewable for up to 18 years maximum; </p><p>the right to purchase or rent land and buildings; and the </p><p>right to import production inputs and export products </p><p>without restrictions and registration in the import/export </p><p>register. </p><p> </p><p>Boycott issues:  Yemen formally renounced observance of the </p><p>secondary and tertiary aspects of the Arab League boycott of </p><p>Israel in 1995.  However, occasional reports of violations </p><p>occur when some Yemeni companies use old purchase order </p><p>forms that contain prohibited language.  When these </p><p>violations are brought to the attention of concerned </p><p>officials, corrective action is taken.  Yemen has stated </p><p>that it will not renounce the primary aspect of the boycott </p><p>absent an Arab League consensus. </p><p> </p><p>A.6. Right to Private Ownership </p><p> </p><p>While foreigners may own property, foreign companies and </p><p>establishments generally may trade in Yemen only through a </p><p>Yemeni agent.  Law 23 of 1997 (amended), Regulating Agencies </p><p>and Branches of Foreign Companies and Firms, outlines the </p><p>requirements for establishing a Yemeni agent.  Chapter 3 of </p><p>law 23 permits foreign companies and firms to conduct </p><p>business in Yemen by establishing foreign-owned and managed </p><p>branches.  Foreign establishments wishing to open branches </p><p>in their own names must obtain a permit by decree from the </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade, subject to law 23 and other </p><p>laws in force at the time of application.  However, as a </p><p>practical matter, establishments should plan to engage a </p><p>Yemeni partner.   Regarding investment projects, under the </p><p>new investment law foreigners can own 100 percent of the </p><p>land and can execute projects without a Yemeni agent and </p><p>without obtaining import/export license from the Ministry of </p><p>Industry and Trade or implementing law 23 of 1997. (The </p><p>investment law has precedence over other laws.) </p><p> </p><p>Mortgage lending in Yemen is rare because of the </p><p>aforementioned unwillingness of the court system to uphold </p><p>the payment of interest.  In addition, Yemen has a long </p><p>history of incomplete or inaccurate land records and </p><p>frequent land ownership disputes, which make using land or </p><p>buildings as collateral difficult for lenders to manage. </p><p>While the general survey authority is working to establish a </p><p>just and legally defensible land registry system, it is some </p><p>years off. </p><p> </p><p>A.7. Protection of Property Rights </p><p> </p><p>Yemen has a record of inadequate protection of intellectual </p><p>property rights (IPR), including patents, trademarks, </p><p>designs, and copyrights.  It has not acceded to any </p><p>international IPR conventions, and its IPR law no. 19 of </p><p>1994 is not TRIPS compliant. Yemen\'s Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade drafted three new projected laws known as the </p><p>patents law; trademark law, and the designs and copyrights </p><p>law.  These three new laws are expected to be approved this </p><p>year by the cabinet, ratified by parliament and endorsed by </p><p>the president, which will replace the IPR law no. 19 of </p><p>1994.  In March 1999, Yemen became a member of the World </p><p>Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and is now </p><p>revising its laws with WIPO guidance.  Yemen\'s application </p><p>to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) was approved in </p><p>July 2000.  As a next step in the accession process, Yemen </p><p>presented to the WTO a memorandum of foreign trade regime in </p><p>October 2002.  As part of its accession requirements, Yemen </p><p>will need to enact its revised IPR legislation and take </p><p>concrete steps to enforce adequately these laws. </p><p> </p><p>A large U.S.-based multinational firm litigated successfully </p><p>a trademark infringement case in Yemen\'s courts in 1999. </p><p>The ruling is now under appeal and the violator continues to </p><p>infringe on the trademark despite the court ruling.  A final </p><p>resolution was expected by the end of 2000, but it is still </p><p>pending in the Supreme Court.  In a second case involving a </p><p>U.S. Company\'s trademark, the Appeal Court handed down a </p><p>final ruling in April 2001 to enforce the rights of the U.S. </p><p>Company.  As of April 2003, the enforcement of the final </p><p>ruling to cease production of the infringed products has not </p><p>been implemented.   Both of these cases demonstrate the </p><p>soundness of Yemen\'s basic IPR laws.  However, enforcement </p><p>of rulings remains weak. </p><p> </p><p>A.8. Transparency of the Regulatory System </p><p> </p><p>While Yemen has fundamentally sound investment laws, labor </p><p>laws, customs tariff regulations and tax laws, transparency </p><p>of implementation and enforcement is elusive.  The next </p><p>steps required in Yemen\'s civil service and administrative </p><p>reform process are to clarify procedures, create </p><p>implementing regulations and build a mechanism by which to </p><p>enforce these standards.  Health and safety standards are </p><p>rudimentary and not enforced. </p><p> </p><p>A.9. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment </p><p> </p><p>In the 1990s, Yemen\'s financial sector consisted of a </p><p>banking system that suffered from a large volume of non- </p><p>performing loans, inadequate loan provisioning, low bank </p><p>capitalization, and weak enforcement of prudential </p><p>standards.  Under a 1997 World Bank-sponsored financial </p><p>sector reform program, the government took actions to </p><p>address these problems.  A bank reform law was passed in </p><p>December 1998 to update, strengthen, and regulate the </p><p>industry.  By June 2000, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) had </p><p>circulated strict regulations pertaining to credit risk </p><p>management, liquidity, insider lending, foreign exchange </p><p>exposure, financial leasing and external auditors.  Banks </p><p>are now required to reach a capital adequacy ratio of eight </p><p>percent and meet new classification and provisioning </p><p>standards for loan portfolios.  Most banks are complying. </p><p>That said, commercial banks still suffer from extremely low </p><p>capitalization rates and are essentially owned by large </p><p>trading families who establish the bank to service their own </p><p>business needs. </p><p> </p><p>Lending to the private sector is constrained by the lack of </p><p>judicial recourse to recover bad loans.  To correct this </p><p>weakness, a steering committee produced a series of reform </p><p>recommendations in mid-1999 that were approved by the </p><p>government and sent to the Ministry of Justice for </p><p>implementation.  Among the recommendations was the </p><p>establishment of special loan recovery courts, which began </p><p>operations in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>The ROYG was engaged in a program to privatize government- </p><p>owned commercial banks, although progress in this area was </p><p>thwarted when parliament did not approve a World Bank credit </p><p>to fund the privatization program.  The National Bank of </p><p>Yemen was to be put up for sale pending a final audit report </p><p>for 1999, but no action has been taken.  The Yemen Bank for </p><p>Reconstruction and Development is under restructuring and </p><p>will likely not be privatized.  The two remaining </p><p>specialized banks--housing and agriculture--are also being </p><p>restructured.  Once sound, they too were to be privatized. </p><p> </p><p>In June 2000, the president signed the Central Bank law no. </p><p>14, which grants greater independence to the CBY.  Its </p><p>mandate will now focus on price stability, limiting public </p><p>sector financing to emergency loans, freedom to adopt its </p><p>own monetary and exchange rate policies, and enforcing </p><p>greater commercial bank accountability.  It is authorized to </p><p>conduct inspections of all banks implement provisioning and </p><p>capital increase schedules, and enforces penalties and </p><p>corrective measures.  Interbank activities are limited, and </p><p>there are no equity or bond markets.  The ROYG is planning </p><p>to establish a stock market in Yemen to promote the </p><p>government\'s private sector-led growth strategy.  However, </p><p>the consensus of most Yemeni and foreign observers is that </p><p>the country lacks the expertise to establish such a market </p><p>at this time.  It is also doubtful that there are sufficient </p><p>numbers of Yemeni investors to sustain an active stock </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p>The CBY began offering treasury bills in December 1995. </p><p>Commercial banks purchased a large share of the bills, </p><p>investing up to 30 percent of their assets in them.  The </p><p>interest rate on T-bills was gradually reduced from a high </p><p>of 23 percent in 1999 to about 13-14 percent in April 2003 </p><p>to encourage investment lending. </p><p> </p><p>A.10. Political Violence </p><p> </p><p>While there were no kidnappings in 2002, Kidnappings of </p><p>foreigners have occurred sporadically since the 1970s and </p><p>received wide international press coverage.  Some tribal </p><p>groups have used hostage taking to put pressure on the </p><p>government to obtain projects or services, or to focus </p><p>government attention on the redress of grievances.  Victims </p><p>have included foreign businessmen, diplomats, aid workers </p><p>and tourists.  Historically, most have been treated well and </p><p>released unharmed after two to three days, although some </p><p>have been held as long as four weeks.  A botched rescue </p><p>attempt during a May 2000 kidnapping of a Norwegian citizen </p><p>resulted in his death.  Tribal kidnappings of foreigners </p><p>have been on the decline since 1998, partly as a result of </p><p>tough penalties enacted by the Yemeni government as a </p><p>deterrent, and no foreigner has been kidnapped in Yemen </p><p>since November 2001.  The president has spoken out strongly </p><p>against kidnapping, terming it "terrorism."  Many tribal </p><p>leaders have given assurances to the ROYG to cooperate in </p><p>hunting down kidnappers. </p><p> </p><p>A significant exception to the usual pattern was the </p><p>kidnapping in Abyan Governorate of 16 foreign tourists in </p><p>December 1998.  Four died during a rescue attempt, at least </p><p>two of those at the hands of the kidnappers.  Most </p><p>observers, however, have concluded that this incident was </p><p>the responsibility of Islamic extremists rather than tribal </p><p>kidnappers.  The perpetrators were tried, found guilty of </p><p>murder, and sentenced.  The Yemeni national who led the </p><p>kidnapping was sentenced to death under the anti-kidnapping </p><p>law of 1998 and executed in October 1999.  The non-Yemeni </p><p>nationals involved were given maximum prison sentences, but </p><p>some were deported in early 2002.  In late December 2002, </p><p>three American doctors were killed near the city of Ibb. </p><p>The perpetrator was convicted and sentenced to execution. </p><p> </p><p>Some tribal elements hijack automobiles or other expensive </p><p>equipment owned by foreign companies as another means to </p><p>pressure the government to accede to their demands. </p><p>Particularly where oil and mineral extraction are concerned, </p><p>some tribes in the mineral-rich areas feel that they are not </p><p>getting their share of the wealth.  Investors in such </p><p>ventures should be sensitive to the need to hire more local </p><p>tribesmen than might first be judged economically necessary </p><p>in order to build community relations and preserve the </p><p>peace.  The provision of community-based buildings and </p><p>services, such as in health care and education, can go a </p><p>long way toward ensuring trouble-free investment in isolated </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>The bombing of the USS Cole in Aden harbor in October 2000, </p><p>in which 17 U.S. Servicemen and woman were killed, and the </p><p>October 2002 bombing of a French oil tanker of the coast of </p><p>Mukalla, are considered to be the acts of international </p><p>terrorists.  The Republic of Yemen Government and the United </p><p>States are cooperating closely on counter terrorism </p><p>measures, and in investigations and preventions following </p><p>repeated terrorist acts. </p><p> </p><p>A.11. Corruption </p><p> </p><p>As one of the poorest countries in the world, with a hugely </p><p>overstaffed (due in part to the unification of North and </p><p>South Yemen) and underpaid civil service, Yemen has a </p><p>significant and widely acknowledged corruption problem.  If </p><p>anticorruption laws exist on the books, they are not </p><p>enforced.  Illicit activities range from soliciting and </p><p>paying bribes to facilitate or obstruct projects, to </p><p>leveraging dispute settlements, skewing taxation and customs </p><p>tariff augmentations, and engaging in family or tribal </p><p>nepotism.  The government recognizes that it must affect </p><p>civil service and administrative reforms (better jobs, </p><p>higher pay, removal of the worst offenders) to create new </p><p>disincentives to corruption.  Following Yemen\'s signing of a </p><p>border treaty with Saudi Arabia in June 2000, Yemen\'s </p><p>president Ali Abdullah Saleh announced a new commitment to </p><p>reduce corruption.  The Ministry of Civil Service has the </p><p>lead on anticorruption issues and has set up an executive </p><p>committee to address the issue.  A national strategic plan </p><p>to eliminate corruption is still not in place, however. </p><p> </p><p>B - Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. and Yemen are currently discussing a bilateral </p><p>investment treaty (BIT) but there is no bilateral tax treaty </p><p>between the two governments.  According to the General </p><p>Investment Authority, Yemen signed in 2002 three new </p><p>investment promotion and protection agreements, bringing the </p><p>total bilateral treaties to 31, with five additional </p><p>countries having initialed a tentative agreement.  Yemen has </p><p>bilateral investment treaties with Algeria, Austria, </p><p>Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Djibouti, Egypt, </p><p>Ethiopia, France, Federation of Russia, Germany, Indonesia, </p><p>Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, the </p><p>Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, </p><p>Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Ukraine, and the United </p><p>Kingdom.  Yemen has initialed agreements with, Croatia, </p><p>Hungary, India, Mongolia, and Romania. </p><p> </p><p>C - OPIC and other Investment Insurance Programs </p><p> </p><p>Yemen and the United States signed an investment guarantee </p><p>agreement in 1972.   As of October 1997, OPIC and EXIM Bank </p><p>are on cover (or provide guarantees) for both private and </p><p>public sector projects of short and medium term (up to seven </p><p>years) duration. Yemen is a member of the Multilateral </p><p>Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </p><p> </p><p>D - Labor </p><p> </p><p>The Yemeni government generally adopts International Labor </p><p>Organization (ILO) standards regarding labor and worker </p><p>rights.  In 1999, it ratified ILO conventions on the </p><p>elimination of the worst forms of child labor and the </p><p>minimum work age for employment.  As in other areas, </p><p>enforcement of the law is weak.  Child labor has increased </p><p>due to the negative impact of economic reforms.  Most </p><p>children work with their families in agriculture, although </p><p>an increasing number are being sent out to work in shops and </p><p>restaurants.  To address this issue, the ROYG signed in June </p><p>2000 an agreement to cooperate with the International </p><p>Program on Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). After </p><p>ratification of the ILO, the ROYG established the Child </p><p>Labor Unit at the Ministry of Labor to implement and enforce </p><p>child labor laws and regulations. Investors may find the </p><p>local pool of skilled labor for technology intensive </p><p>ventures limited. </p><p> </p><p>Yemen\'s overall illiteracy rate is approximately 47 percent </p><p>(2000), 27.7 percent for men and 67.5 percent for women. </p><p>Given the departure of thousands of unskilled and semi- </p><p>skilled Yemeni laborers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other </p><p>Gulf states during the 1990-1991 Gulf war, Yemen\'s </p><p>unemployment rate now stands at about 35 percent.  Those who </p><p>complete secondary education and university studies in Yemen </p><p>often do not possess the same professional standards as </p><p>their counterparts hailing from Western educational </p><p>institutions.  University graduates also experience </p><p>difficulty finding appropriate employment and are sometimes </p><p>unwilling to accept lower skilled jobs.  The government is </p><p>beginning to focus considerable attention on increasing </p><p>access to and improving the quality of vocational training </p><p>as a means to develop a cadre of skilled laborers in high </p><p>demand fields, including construction workers, electricians, </p><p>plumbers and carpenters. </p><p> </p><p>E - Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports </p><p> </p><p>The Yemen Free Zone Public Authority was established in 1991 </p><p>to develop the Aden Free Zone.  Yeminvest, a joint venture </p><p>of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) and the Bin Mahfouz </p><p>Group of Saudi Arabia, was awarded the concession to develop </p><p>the area.  PSA now holds primary ownership and manages the </p><p>Aden Container Terminal.  ACT started operating in March </p><p>1999, and was officially opened in September of that year. </p><p>The impressive growth was achieved in spite of the effects </p><p>of September 11.  However, the October 2002 terrorist attack </p><p>on the French oil tanker M/V Limburg significantly impacted </p><p>Yemen\'s economy.  Initially, insurance premiums rose 250% </p><p>and as a result, ships were diverted to the ports of </p><p>Djibouti and Salalah in Oman.  The ROYG is working with the </p><p>insurance industry to lower insurance rates, and by the end </p><p>of 2003 insurance premiums may drop somewhat. In 2003, it is </p><p>expected to handle 388,500 Tons Equivalent Units, TEUs, a 3 </p><p>percent rise over the 377,400 TEUs of 2002. The port mainly </p><p>serves as a transshipment hub, but attempts are being made </p><p>to increase the percentage of the local cargo through the </p><p>development of the industrial and warehousing estate.  Both </p><p>the container terminal and industrial estate are run by PSA </p><p>and its infrastructure is now in place. </p><p> </p><p>In its first phase of development, ACT planned to handle up </p><p>to 1 million Tons Equivalent Units annually on its two- </p><p>berth, 700m quay.  Recently a fifth quay crane was added in </p><p>February 2002 bringing current capacity to 650,000 TEUs. </p><p>The container yard of 35 hectares offers storage capacity </p><p>for 10,000 boxes. </p><p> </p><p>The industrial and warehousing estate called Aden Distripark </p><p>(ADP) has been launched.  The first 30 hectares are ready </p><p>for occupation and building of tenants\' factories and </p><p>warehouses.  This area will grow to 74 hectares and </p><p>eventually to 1,550 hectares when demand increases.  The </p><p>Aden Container Terminal and the Aden Free Zone are promising </p><p>areas for investment.  Majority ownership and operation by </p><p>PSA as assured technical excellence both in construction and </p><p>management of the container port.  Yeminvest is offering </p><p>special "early bird" deals to the first investors. </p><p>Opportunities in light industry, repackaging and </p><p>storage/distribution operations are welcome.  Future plans </p><p>include development of heavy industry and more extensive </p><p>tourist facilities than currently exist in the greater Aden </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p>Free zone incentives include 100 percent foreign ownership, </p><p>no personal income taxes for non-Yemenis, and corporate tax </p><p>holiday for 15 years (renewable for 10 additional years), </p><p>100 percent repatriation of capital and profits, no currency </p><p>restrictions, and no restrictions on, or sponsoring </p><p>required, for the employment of foreign staff.   Aden\'s main </p><p>selling point is its strategic location - nine days steaming </p><p>from Europe and seven from Singapore.  It is just 4 nautical </p><p>miles off the main Far East - Europe sea route.  PSA\'s </p><p>expertise and management guarantees stability and efficiency </p><p>to shipping lines calling at ACT and investors to the ADP. </p><p>For further information, contact: Richard Cheong, Chief </p><p>Executive Officer, Yeminvest, P.O. Box 4165, Aden, Republic </p><p>of Yemen (Phone:  967-2-234-789 or Fax:  967-2-234-880. </p><p>Email: crichard@yeminvest.com, or check out the website: </p><p>http://www.yeminvest.com; or http://www.psa.com.sg). </p><p> </p><p>In May 2001, a new terminal at Aden International Airport </p><p>was officially opened.  In addition a study was completed in </p><p>August 2001 for future plans for the airport to include a </p><p>duty free zone and cargo village to facilitate transit trade </p><p>with the Aden Free Zone port facilities.  The Aden Free Zone </p><p>Authority is looking for a company to build and operate the </p><p>cargo village. </p><p> </p><p>F - Foreign Direct Investment Statistics </p><p> </p><p>Yemen produces no reliable statistics on foreign direct </p><p>investment.  Most U.S. investment in Yemen to date is in oil </p><p>exploration, production and oil field services. </p><p></p></div>
