<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE SURVEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 100859 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Following are answers to the questions posed in reftel. </p><p>We would be happy to provide more detailed answers on </p><p>request.  Jordan already has a large, well-functioning </p><p>micro-finance sector that is supported by USAID and other </p><p>institutions.  As a general observation, we believe that a </p><p>regional institution that would be able to support training </p><p>and serve as a consultant to new and existing microfinance </p><p>institutions, and that could publish training and other </p><p>material in Arabic, would add economies of scale to a </p><p>regional microfinance initiative.  We understand that this </p><p>subject was discussed at a recent USAID-sponsored </p><p>microfinance conference in Morocco. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin Questions and answers. </p><p> </p><p>-WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE ENTERPRISES </p><p>(SME) IN YOUR COUNTRY? ANNUAL REVENUES? </p><p> </p><p>Jordanian SME\'s typically have annual revenues of $0-10 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>-WHAT SIZE OF INVESTMENTS DO SME\'S TYPICALLY SEEK? </p><p> </p><p>A typical investment size for a Jordanian SME could be $1-2 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>-WHAT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL (OF ALL TYPES) TO THE </p><p>SME MARKET SEGMENT? </p><p> </p><p>Jordanian SME\'s generally rely on "friends and family" for </p><p>financing for both start-up and expansion.  Strict collateral </p><p>and other requirements make it difficult to call on bank </p><p>financing for other than working needs.  However, some small </p><p>"venture capital" funds are beginning to emerge.  For </p><p>example, the local firm Foursan has been working with </p><p>Deutsche Bank to create a $20 million venture capital fund </p><p>that would be seeded by $10-$20 million in government </p><p>privatization revenues. </p><p> </p><p>-IS CAPITAL AVAILABILITY A FACTOR IN THE GROWTH OF THE SME </p><p>SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY? </p><p> </p><p>Growth of the SME sector is definitely inhibited by limited </p><p>access to capital.  Another important factor is limited </p><p>management expertise, a subject that is being addressed </p><p>through USAID\'s "JUSBP" program and the EU\'s "EJADA" program. </p><p> </p><p>-HOW ARE SME\'S TYPICALLY FUNDED, I.E. INTERNALLY GENERATED </p><p>CAPITAL, FAMILY LOANS, DEBT, EQUITY, ETC? </p><p> </p><p>See above. </p><p> </p><p>-DO SME\'S USE EXISTING FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES FOR THEIR </p><p>CAPITAL NEEDS? </p><p> </p><p>See above.  Access to financial intermediaries is limited, </p><p>although growing. </p><p> </p><p>-IS THERE A SEGMENT OF THE MARKET THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM </p><p>MICRO-CREDIT PROGRAM? DOES THIS SEGMENT OF THE MARKET HAVE </p><p>ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ON WHAT TERMS? WHAT ARE THE CAPITAL </p><p>NEEDS OF THIS MARKET? </p><p> </p><p>The USG has supported the creation of a vibrant and growing </p><p>microfinance industry.  Currently, four such institutions, </p><p>utilizing international best practices related to lending </p><p>procedures, are operating.  Over the last four years these </p><p>institutions have provided over 90,000 loans.  A recent study </p><p>shows that between these and other institutions presently in </p><p>place, there is little need for a further expansion of </p><p>capital suppliers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY ANALYSIS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-DO FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES SERVICE THE SME MARKET SEGMENT? </p><p>HOW WELL? </p><p>Financial intermediaries (primarily commercial banks) do </p><p>service the SME market segment to a limited extent.  However, </p><p>their strict collateral requirements and overall conservative </p><p>outlook reduce their effectiveness in servicing SMEs </p><p>financial needs. </p><p> </p><p>-WHAT IF ANY TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO </p><p>SERVICE SME\'S? </p><p> </p><p>Credit granted through loans and L/Cs is the most common type </p><p>of financial instruments used to service SMEs. </p><p> </p><p>-ARE THERE POTENTIAL PROFITABLE MARKET NICHES IN THE SME </p><p>SEGMENT THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT BEING EXPLOITED? </p><p>Market niches for SMEs in Information and Communication </p><p>Technology, consultancy, financial services and the health </p><p>sector exist and remain under-explored. </p><p> </p><p>-ARE THERE ANY FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT PROVIDE CAPITAL </p><p>TO THE MICRO-MARKET? ARE THEY EFFECTIVE? </p><p> </p><p>Yes, the micro-market is quite well served (see the answer </p><p>above).  A regional microfinance program that took advantage </p><p>of economies of scale related to the industry as a whole, </p><p>however, could be very effective at delivering specific </p><p>services on a regional basis.  These include general </p><p>training, consulting services, and printed materials in </p><p>Arabic. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-ARE THERE ANY REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE OPERATION OF A </p><p>FOREIGN-OWNED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (E.G. ENTERPRISE FUND, </p><p>MICRO CREDIT PROGRAM) OPERATING IN YOUR COUNTRY? </p><p> </p><p>No.  Foreign-owned financial institutions are treated on par </p><p>with local ones. </p><p> </p><p>-COULD STATE-OWNED AND/OR PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS FROM YOUR </p><p>COUNTRY INVEST IN AN ENTERPRISE FUND WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND? </p><p> </p><p>While no regulations exist in this regard, private/public </p><p>investment funds would likely (but not necessarily) wish to </p><p>participate in the management of an enterprise fund in which </p><p>they invest.   State-owned investment funds, such as the </p><p>Social Security Corporation, face restrictions regarding </p><p>off-shore investing. </p><p> </p><p>-COULD AN NGO-BASED MICRO-CREDIT PROGRAM OPERATE IN YOUR </p><p>COUNTRY? </p><p> </p><p>Several NGO-based microfinance organizations currently </p><p>operate in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>OTHER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>-WOULD THE OPERATION AND PRESENCE OF AN ENTERPRISE FUND IN </p><p>YOUR COUNTRY HAVE A CATALYTIC EFFECT ON STIMULATING PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR INVESTMENT? </p><p> </p><p>In addition to providing financial resources, an enterprise </p><p>fund that offered high-quality technical financial advice </p><p>could be an important addition to the Jordanian private </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>-WOULD PRIVATE CAPITAL FROM YOUR COUNTRY BE INTERESTED IN </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN AN ENTERPRISE FUND? </p><p> </p><p>Private and possibly official capital could be interested in </p><p>participating in a well-managed, focused fund. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
