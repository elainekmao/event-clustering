<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  GOVERNMENT NAMES MEMBERS OF NEGOTIATING </p><p>TEAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0656 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0468 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On April 16 the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>announced the members of the team it appointed to negotiate </p><p>with Maoist insurgents.  As expected, the appointees are all </p><p>members of the Cabinet.  The six-person team, headed by </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal, includes: </p><p>Physical Works Minister Narayan Singh Pun, GON-appointed </p><p>coordinator for the talks; Information Minister Ramesh Nath </p><p>Pandey; Labor Minister Kamal Prasad Chaulagain; Health </p><p>Minister Upendra Devkota; and Assistant Minister for Women, </p><p>Children and Social Welfare Anuradha Koirala.  No date for </p><p>the beginning of proposed peace talks with the Maoists has </p><p>yet been set. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Comment:  The composition of the team offers an </p><p>interesting mix of backgrounds.  Deputy PM Mandal and </p><p>Information Minister Pandey were former ministers in the </p><p>partyless Panchayat regime.  A former member of the National </p><p>Assembly, Pandey has close links to the Palace.  Like Maoist </p><p>negotiator Matrika Yadav, Mandal comes from the southern </p><p>Terai plains along the border with India.  Labor Minister </p><p>Chaulagain (a former member of the Communist Party of Nepal - </p><p>United Marxist Leninist) and Health Minister Devkota, on the </p><p>other hand, are generally perceived as the "leftists" in the </p><p>Cabinet.  (Devkota also knows Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoists\' </p><p>lead negotiator, from their school days together in Gorkha, </p><p>where Bhattarai habitually topped the class and Devkota </p><p>ranked second.)  Physical Works Minister Pun, who has been </p><p>the GON\'s point man for dealing with the Maoists since the </p><p>declaration of the ceasefire on January 29, is a former Army </p><p>Colonel and, like Maoist negotiator and military strategist </p><p>Ram Bahadur Thapa, a member of the Magar ethnic group. </p><p>Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare </p><p>Anuradha Koirala, the only woman in the Cabinet, was most </p><p>likely chosen in order to represent the concerns of women. </p><p>(The Maoists, who laud equal rights for women in their </p><p>rhetoric, have been criticized in some quarters for not </p><p>having included a woman on their five-man negotiating team.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment continued:  Maoist complaints that the GON </p><p>was stalling by not announcing the members of its team had </p><p>grown increasingly strident over the past few weeks, with the </p><p>insurgents citing the delay as "evidence" that the GON is not </p><p>serious about dialogue (Ref A).  The GON\'s move is likely an </p><p>effort to defuse such criticism.  At the same time, a spate </p><p>of rumors--reportedly fueled by intra-Cabinet rivalries--over </p><p>the past week had been hinting that Minister Pun would be </p><p>replaced as lead negotiator for the GON.  Chief among Pun\'s </p><p>detractors, apparently, were Mandal and Pandey.  The </p><p>appointment of panchayati apologist Mandal, who outstrips Pun </p><p>in Cabinet rank, if not in negotiating skill or intellect, </p><p>may have been intended to mitigate these jealousies.  Whether </p><p>these rivalries will undermine the performance or </p><p>cohesiveness of the GON team remains to be seen.  Leaders of </p><p>the main parliamentary parties can be expected to complain at </p><p>their exclusion from the team (Nepali Congress President G.P. </p><p>Koirala is said to be already urging the Maoists not to </p><p>negotiate with the interim government).  The parties </p><p>themselves, however, all but ensured their own exclusion </p><p>through their consistent refusal to cooperate with the GON </p><p>(Ref B). </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
