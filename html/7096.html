SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The port of Halifax is facing a growing </p><p>problem of stowaways, primarily of Romanian nationality, who </p><p>arrive here hidden in shipping containers on board commercial </p><p>freight vessels originating at southern European ports. </p><p>Certain smuggling rings, probably linked to organized crime, </p><p>appear to be exploiting marine shipping to Halifax as their </p><p>preferred means of getting illegal migrants into North America. </p><p>It is unclear how many of these container stowaways are seeking </p><p>to enter the United States as their final destination.  (END </p><p>SUMMARY) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Over the past several years, Canadian authorities in </p><p>Halifax have discovered increasing numbers of intending </p><p>immigrants arriving as stowaways aboard commercial container </p><p>ships bound from southern European ports.  Contacts in the Royal </p><p>Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and in Citizenship and </p><p>Immigration Canada (CIC) have told Congen that, in 2000, they </p><p>arrested at least 25 persons attempting to enter the country in </p><p>this manner.  By 2002, the number had risen to 42.   Although no </p><p>stowaways have yet been intercepted in Halifax in 2003, it is </p><p>too early in the year to identify a trend because most alien </p><p>smuggling of this type occurs during the warmer months of the </p><p>year.  Local officials also acknowledge that it impossible to </p><p>know how many stowaways arrive in Halifax this way without being </p><p>detected. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Marine container stowaways arriving in Halifax are </p><p>predominantly Romanian (at least 90 percent), although a small </p><p>number of Moldavians, Bulgarians, and other Eastern Europeans </p><p>have also taken this route.   According to CIC contacts, they </p><p>tend to be males between the ages of 18 and 45.  Most had been </p><p>living and working illegally for some time in other European </p><p>countries (particularly Italy and Spain), usually in </p><p>construction or as unskilled laborers, prior to embarking. </p><p>About 90 percent claim to have been assisted by a smuggler, who </p><p>brings them into the cargo terminal and places them in a </p><p>container prior to loading.  The intending immigrants are </p><p>responsible for bringing their own food, water, toilet </p><p>facilities, and cutting tools.  Fees for this service generally </p><p>range from 500 to 1,500 Euros.  CIC and RCMP officials strongly </p><p>suspect that  these smugglers have ties to organized crime, but </p><p>they have made no progress in identifying which criminal </p><p>organizations are involved. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Smugglers typically place the intending immigrants in </p><p>40-foot shipping containers loaded with heavy goods such as </p><p>ceramic tile, paper, wine, or cognac.  These containers have </p><p>sufficient empty space inside to accommodate the passengers. </p><p>The smugglers instruct their customers to cut themselves out of </p><p>their containers after about two days at sea, once the vessel is </p><p>far enough out to guarantee that the shipQs captain will not </p><p>turn around to put the stowaways ashore at the port of origin. </p><p>Halifax officials are convinced that these smuggling rings have </p><p>accomplices among the stevedores responsible for loading </p><p>vessels, since the containers with stowaways invariably are </p><p>placed along the outside of a stack, allowing the occupants an </p><p>easy exit from the container. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In past years, according to Halifax officials, most </p><p>container stowaways had originated from the Italian ports of </p><p>Livorno and Genova.  As recently as late 2001, the RCMP had </p><p>confided to Congen that Italian authorities seemed to show </p><p>little enthusiasm for aggressively combating this type of </p><p>outgoing alien smuggling from their ports.  RCMP and CIC </p><p>contacts, however, now indicate that interest in port security </p><p>measures and cooperation in combating alien smuggling via </p><p>shipping containers has increased markedly among their Italian </p><p>contacts in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  The RCMP </p><p>believes that port security measures adopted principally to </p><p>combat terrorism are beginning to have a beneficial trickle-down </p><p>effect on attempts to curb this type of illegal immigration. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) As Italian ports are becoming less accessible, our </p><p>contacts say, alien smugglers are shifting their efforts to </p><p>Spain, transforming Barcelona into the preferred port of </p><p>departure for container ship stowaways.  Officials of the RCMPQs </p><p>Immigration and Passport Section returned last week from a visit </p><p>to Barcelona to improve cooperation and coordination with their </p><p>port security counterparts there.  These officials told conoff </p><p>that the Spanish were cooperative and appear to be making major </p><p>strides in tightening security at the port.  They reported that </p><p>new security measures in the port of Barcelona include a network </p><p>of 65 cameras tied to a central monitoring facility, improved </p><p>access IDQs for port workers, the introduction of electronic </p><p>cargo manifests, gamma-ray scanning devices, and improved </p><p>container seals.  RCMP contacts also report the active support </p><p>of the stevedoreQs union, such as by making clear to its </p><p>membership that any complicity in alien smuggling would result </p><p>in the loss of union membership. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Our contacts are cautiously optimistic that cooperation </p><p>with Italian and Spanish authorities will reverse the trend in </p><p>alien smuggling to Halifax via marine containers.  The RCMP, </p><p>however, fears that the criminal organizations that involved in </p><p>trafficking in illegal immigrants might then simply shift their </p><p>efforts to other European ports with easier access.  They say </p><p>that Lisbon could become a venue for such activity because port </p><p>security there has not improved as quickly or as markedly as in </p><p>Italy and Spain. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT:  It is unclear how many of these container </p><p>stowaways are seeking to enter the United States as their final </p><p>destination.  Some of the ships carrying these intending </p><p>immigrants were bound for U.S. ports after leaving Halifax.  We </p><p>will endeavor to get our local police and immigration contacts </p><p>to focus on this question in their future investigations into </p><p>this alien smuggling problem. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
