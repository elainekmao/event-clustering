SUMMARY.  U.S. MISSION/ROME OFFICERS MET ON FRIDAY, </p><p>DECEMBER 28 WITH THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) </p><p>ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (AED) AND DIRECTOR OF </p><p>OPERATIONS, MOHAMMED ZEJJARI.  AS WINTER FOOD NEEDS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN ARE BEING MET BY WFP\'S CURRENT OPERATION </p><p>(ALMOST 120,000 TONS DISPATCHED IN DECEMBER), ITS </p><p>FUTURE PROGRAMMING IS DISCUSSED.  THE WFP AND THE U.N. </p><p>FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION (FAO) ARE WORKING </p><p>TOGETHER TO FORM A FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENT UNIT FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  U.S. MISSION REQUESTS WFP TO CONDUCT </p><p>SURVEYS IN A FEW DISTRICTS IN ORDER TO SPOT-CHECK THE </p><p>VAM FINDINGS.  WFP\'S AED REGISTERED USG CONCERNS AND </p><p>WILL FOLLOW-UP WITH HIS STAFF AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>------------ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00001  01 OF 02  020616Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  AS REPORTED IN REF TEL, WFP\'S VULNERABILITY AND </p><p>ANALYSIS MAPPING (VAM) UNIT FOR AFGHANISTAN IS IN THE </p><p>MIDST OF EXPANDING ITS OPERATION.  WFP AND FAO HAVE </p><p>BEEN DISCUSSING WAYS IN WHICH TO CREATE A FOOD SECURITY </p><p>ASSESSMENT UNIT (FSAU) THAT WOULD COMBINE THE EXPERTISE </p><p>OF EACH AGENCY AND FOLD IN THE ELEMENTS OF THE VAM INTO </p><p>THE NEW UNIT.  IN MID-NOVEMBER, FAO SENT TO ISLAMABAD </p><p>THE PERSON WHO HEADED THE FOOD SECURITY SURVEILLANCE </p><p>UNIT IN KOSOVO, FRANCESCO DEL RE.  WFP/ISLAMABAD </p><p>PROVIDED HIM WITH A DESK IN ITS BUILDING, AND HE WORKED </p><p>VERY CLOSELY WITH THE HEAD OF THE VAM UNIT.  AFTER TWO </p><p>WEEKS, HE COMPOSED A PROPOSAL THAT WAS SHARED WITH WFP </p><p>SOON AFTER HIS DEPARTURE.  AS WAS DONE IN KOSOVO, THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE VAM AND NEW ACTIVITIES BROUGHT TO </p><p>BEAR BY FAO WOULD BE UNITED UNDER ONE ROOF, ONE </p><p>MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, AND UNDER THE NAME OF THE FSAU. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE MEANTIME, WFP HEADQUARTERS (HQ) WAS READYING </p><p>TO SEND ANOTHER PERSON TO HEAD THE VAM UNIT IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD AND HE ARRIVED AT POST ON DECEMBER 15.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, A NEW WFP COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR AFGHANISTAN </p><p>BEGAN MID-NOVEMBER.  IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THE </p><p>FORMATION OF THE FSAU SEEMS TO HAVE SLOWED.  AS OUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING </p><p>MANY FACETS OF AN AFGHAN\'S LIFE AS IT RELATES TO </p><p>HIS/HER ABILITY TO FEED HIS/HER FAMILY, THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF COMBINING THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH AGENCIES AND WORKING </p><p>TOGETHER TO GATHER AND ANALYZE THE INFORMATION REMAINS </p><p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FROM THE EMERGENCY PHASE </p><p>TO REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00001  01 OF 02  020616Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  U.S. MISSION/ROME OFFICERS LAVELLE AND DAVIS MET ON </p><p>FRIDAY, DECEMBER 28 WITH WFP\'S ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR AND DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, MOHAMMED ZEJJARI, </p><p>TO REVIEW CONCERNS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT PHASE </p><p>OF WFP\'S OPERATION IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>COMBINED EFFORTS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  MISSION OFFICER DAVIS OUTLINED THE PROGRESS MADE </p><p>BETWEEN WFP AND FAO IN ESTABLISHING THE FSAU AND </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT BOTH AGENCIES HAVE STRENGTHS TO BRING TO </p><p>SUCH A UNIT.  SUCH STRENGTHS BECOME EVEN MORE ACUTE </p><p>WHEN THE FORCES ARE COMBINED.  A PAUCITY OF DATA EXISTS </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN, AND WE NEED TO USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR </p><p>DISPOSAL IN GATHERING AND ANALYZING INFORMATION THAT </p><p>SERVES TO GUIDE THE USG AND OTHER DONORS, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE U.N., IN ITS PROGRAMMING. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9854 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00001  02 OF 02  020616Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   TEST-00  SA-00    FMP-00   PRM-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------524B3F  020623Z /38 </p><p>R 020528Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMCONSUL KARACHI </p><p>AMCONSUL PESHAWAR </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASHGABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY DUSHANBE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TASHKENT </p><p>INFO SECSTATE WASHDC 1457 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2490 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00001  02 OF 02  020616Z </p><p>ISLAMABAD FOR DART </p><p>TASHKENT FOR DART </p><p>ASHGABAT FOR DART </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA NANCE KYLOH </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>USEU FOR KFULLER AND KDEBLAU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFPO, UN, PREF, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: IDENTIFYING FOOD NEEDS IN AFGHANISTAN:  NOW </p><p>AND IN THE FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>6.  MISSION OFFICERS CONGRATULATED WFP ON ITS </p><p>TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT IN MOVING LARGE QUANTITIES OF </p><p>FOOD INTO AFGHANISTAN, BUT CAUTIONED THAT ONCE WE </p><p>EMERGE FROM MEETING THE WINTER NEEDS, USAID WILL BE </p><p>LOOKING CLOSELY AT WFP\'S DECISIONS ON HOW FUTURE FOOD </p><p>NEEDS ARE DETERMINED AND HOW FOOD IS PROGRAMMED.  THE </p><p>OFFICERS POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD BE IN WFP\'S </p><p>INTERESTS TO HAVE ANOTHER AGENCY INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>DETERMINATION OF NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NOTE.  U.S. MISSION OFFICER DAVIS IS ALSO IN </p><p>CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH FAO\'S SPECIAL RELIEF OPERATIONS </p><p>SERVICE (TCOR) TO ENSURE THAT FAO/TCOR IS READY TO </p><p>PROVIDE APPROPRIATE STAFFING TO THE UNIT, AS SOON AS A </p><p>WORKING ARRANGEMENT IS ACCEPTED BY BOTH PARTIES.  END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SPOT-CHECKING THE VAM RESULTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00001  02 OF 02  020616Z </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE MISSION OFFICERS STRONGLY </p><p>ENCOURAGED WFP TO CONDUCT "SPOT-CHECKS" IN A FEW </p><p>DISTRICTS OF AFGHANISTAN THAT ARE CURRENTLY ACCESSIBLE. </p><p>SUCH SPOT-CHECKS WOULD WORK TO CONFIRM THE VAM RESULTS </p><p>THAT ARE GUIDING WFP\'S DISTRIBUTIONS.  DONORS WOULD </p><p>WELCOME SUCH CONFIRMATION, SINCE THERE HAS BEEN SOME </p><p>CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE RESULTS.  SOME THINK THE NEEDS </p><p>ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER, AND OTHERS THINK THE NEEDS ARE </p><p>LOWER THAN WHAT VAM HAS DETERMINED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ZEJJARI SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>TAKING THIS ACTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE </p><p>USAID/DISASTER ASSISTANCE RESPONSE TEAM (DART) HAS ALSO </p><p>RECENTLY DISCUSSED THIS MATTER WITH VARIOUS WFP STAFF </p><p>IN ISLAMABAD. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  AS STATED IN REFTEL, ONE OF THE FIRST PLANNED </p><p>TASKS OF THE VAM FOR THE NEW YEAR WAS TO CONDUCT A </p><p>NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE WEST (HARDEST-HIT BY </p><p>DROUGHT), FOLLOWED BY A NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>ENTIRE COUNTRY.  SUCH A STUDY COULD ALSO SERVE TO RE- </p><p>CONFIRM NEEDS OUTLINED BY THE VAM RESULTS.  EVEN THOUGH </p><p>WFP HAD IDENTIFIED A NUTRITIONIST FOR THE WORK, THE </p><p>AGREEMENT FELL THROUGH, AND WFP IS NOW RECRUITING AGAIN </p><p>FOR THE POSITION.  MISSION OFFICERS SUGGESTED ASKING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00001  02 OF 02  020616Z </p><p>FAO FOR A NUTRITIONIST. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ZEJJARI LISTENED CLOSELY TO U.S. MISSION\'S </p><p>CONCERNS, BUT MADE FEW COMMENTS OR COMMITMENTS.  HE </p><p>DID, HOWEVER, CLEARLY REGISTER OUR COMMENTS ABOUT WFP\'S </p><p>NEED TO JUSTIFY ITS FUTURE PROGRAMMING.  HIS SPECIAL </p><p>ASSISTANT TOOK DETAILED NOTES OF OUR CONVERSATION, AND </p><p>HE PROMISED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE STAFF </p><p>UPON THEIR RETURN FROM THE HOLIDAYS.  U.S. MISSION WILL </p><p>FOLLOW THESE DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
