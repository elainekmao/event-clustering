(C) During a February 20 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>refused to comment on the veracity of GON claims that </p><p>officers associated with the October 2001 Benue massacre </p><p>were transferred, retired or otherwise relieved.  When the </p><p>Ambassador tried to raise the issue, Batagarawa said he </p><p>would not discuss it and asked the Ambassador to "just </p><p>leave it" for now.  Batagarawa promised to return to the </p><p>Benue issue "later". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: Batagarawa claims not to have known of </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s December 2002 letter to Senator </p><p>Feingold until the Ambassador informed him of its </p><p>existence.  On several occasions since, Batagarawa has </p><p>promised to provide the Ambassador with evidence of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s claim to have taken punitive action against </p><p>officers involved in the Benue incident.  Batagarawa\'s </p><p>subsequent refusal to discuss the issue lends credibility </p><p>to previous Embassy and DAO Abuja reporting indicating any </p><p>transfers/retirements were not punitive in nature, but </p><p>rather were routine personnel actions.  While Post cannot </p><p>be certain, it is likely Batagarawa\'s promise of proof was </p><p>an attempt to stall while he investigated the matter. </p><p>Having found no evidence to support his President\'s claims, </p><p>Batagarawa has decided to avoid discussing the issue. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
