<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001272 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/21/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MOPS, PHUM, NI, LI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:-TWO BATTALIONS CAN DEPLOY QUICKLY TO </p><p>LIBERIA-BUT NEED HELP </p><p> </p><p>Classified By Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  During a late evening July 19 </p><p>discussion with Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo </p><p>decided Nigeria would deploy two OFR-trained </p><p>battalions to Liberia.  Obasanjo gave the green light </p><p>to deploying one of the battalions currently in Sierra </p><p>Leone and also a battalion currently in Nigeria. </p><p>Obasanjo hoped that he could leverage deployment of </p><p>the two battalions into future OFR-style training for </p><p>an additional five battalions as discussed during </p><p>President Bush\'s July 12 visit to Nigeria. Stressing </p><p>that Nigeria was prepared to deploy quickly, he </p><p>discounted reports that ECOWAS would not be ready to </p><p>deploy until mid-August.  Obasanjo said that when he </p><p>visited Conakry July 14, President Conte had agreed to </p><p>restrain LURD but that Conte had not followed through </p><p>this promise.  Obasanjo stated that once Nigeria </p><p>troops had deployed he would give Charles Taylor a 48- </p><p>hour ultimatum to go into exile or face arrest. </p><p>Currently, a Liberian delegation headed by Minister of </p><p>State Jonathan Taylor was visiting Nigeria, ostensibly </p><p>to prepare for Taylor\'s asylum.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WE CAN DEPLOY OFR BATTALIONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a July 19 meeting at the Presidential </p><p>Villa, Ambassador delivered the demarche on the use of </p><p>OFR-trained battalions to President Obasanjo. </p><p>Obasanjo responded positively that Nigeria would </p><p>deploy OFR-battalions.  The first battalion could be </p><p>one currently deployed in Sierra Leone. Mentioning </p><p>that UN SYG Annan had raised this possibility with </p><p>him, Obasanjo said he told Annan that Nigeria would </p><p>not object to shifting a battalion from Sierra Leone </p><p>to Liberia provided the level of assistance (i.e. </p><p>equipment, logistical support and per diem) were </p><p>commensurate to that received in Sierra Leone. </p><p>Obasanjo said he did not want his soldiers receiving </p><p>less pay in exchange for Liberia\'s greater danger. </p><p>That would be callous and the soldiers would grumble </p><p>that I was stealing their money, Obasanjo asserted. </p><p>(Comment: Obasanjo\'s point is well taken from his </p><p>perspective.  It would be difficult to ask soldiers to </p><p>receive less in the face of greater danger in Liberia. </p><p>Moreover, if the stipend for the Nigerian battalion </p><p>coming out of Sierra Leone must match UN levels, it </p><p>will be difficult not to apply the same daily stipend </p><p>to the entire ECOWAS deployment in Liberia. End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Obasanjo continued that the second battalion </p><p>would be an OFR battalion currently in Ogoja, Cross </p><p>Rivers State.  That battalion was deployed in Ogoja </p><p>due to the friction with Cameroon over the Bakassi </p><p>peninsula; however, with the de-escalation of tension </p><p>resulting from the ongoing bilateral dialogue with </p><p>Cameroon, Obasanjo felt comfortable in moving that </p><p>battalion.  Obasanjo had briefly contemplated using </p><p>the battalion headquartered at Agenebode, Edo State. </p><p>However, elements of that battalion have been advanced </p><p>to Warri in contemplation of a police action against </p><p>Ijaw militants who have taken over control of the </p><p>environs around Warri and disrupted oil production. </p><p>Hinting that action in Warri might be imminent, </p><p>Obasanjo concluded he would not interrupt the </p><p>deployment of these forces.  (Note: We subsequently </p><p>learned from General Akoji, Director of Army </p><p>Operations, that 26 Battalion in Sokoto would deploy </p><p>to Liberia, not the Ogoja battalion.  The Ogoja </p><p>battalion had already served in Sierra Leone but was </p><p>not OFR-trained.  Because it was once deployed in </p><p>Sierra Leone, Obasanjo apparently had thought that it </p><p>was an OFR-trained unit.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo interrupted his conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter to telephone Chief of Defense Staff </p><p>General Ogomudia.  Obasanjo instructed Ogomudia that </p><p>Nigeria should deploy the two OFR battalions to </p><p>Liberia.  Ogomudia dissented, offering that battalions </p><p>currently in Plateau and Taraba States be sent to </p><p>Liberia.  Obasanjo overruled his Defense Chief\'s </p><p>objections, explaining that demonstrating maximum use </p><p>of the OFR battalions would build a strong argument in </p><p>favor of USG-OFR-style training for an additional five </p><p>battalions.  After ending the telephone conversation </p><p>with Ogomudia, Obasanjo said that his Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff was "hopping mad" and that he would need to show </p><p>the army that Nigeria had received some benefit for </p><p>deploying the OFR battalions.  Obasanjo then remarked </p><p>that President Bush should honor Nigeria\'s request to </p><p>train an additional five battalions.  Obasanjo </p><p>repeated this tacit quid pro quo several more times </p><p>during the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WE CAN DEPLOY QUICKLY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo dismissed the report that ECOWAS would </p><p>not be ready to deploy until August 16.  The President </p><p>claimed that neither he nor his Chief of Defense Staff </p><p>knew the source of that report.  Obasanjo stated that </p><p>he was trying to locate General Abubakar, the ECOWAS </p><p>negotiator, to see if he knew the source of this </p><p>untimely message.  Obasanjo stressed that he was </p><p>prepared to deploy Nigeria troops within a few days </p><p>provided the needed logistical support was given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>LURD MUST STOP </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter told Obasanjo that the LURD, </p><p>quickly advancing on Monrovia, must be compelled to </p><p>stop its offensive.  Monrovia risked descent into </p><p>chaos that would make troop deployment almost </p><p>impossible.  Obasanjo revealed that his July 14 visit </p><p>to Conakry was to tell President Conte to bridle the </p><p>LURD before they entered Monrovia.  He warned Conte </p><p>that he would hold the Guinean leader responsible </p><p>should one Nigerian soldier be hurt or killed by a </p><p>LURD bullet.  Conte, Obasanjo recalled, acknowledged </p><p>that he had leverage with the LURD and would act to </p><p>throttle its offensive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The MFI\'s Advisor for Africa interjected that </p><p>the Guinea Foreign Minister had admitted that Conte </p><p>had not yet contacted the LURD.  Obasanjo stated that </p><p>he would attempt again to talk to Conte.  At that </p><p>point, he received a telephone call from General </p><p>Abubakar.  Abubakar said that he had advised LURD </p><p>Chairman Conneh to end the attack.  Abubakar also </p><p>planned to issue a statement calling for the </p><p>restoration of the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE U.S. ROLE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter stressed that President Bush </p><p>had not made the decision on whether to deploy </p><p>American troops.  However, we will do our best to </p><p>provide assistance such as lift and equipment.  He </p><p>mentioned the possibility of the U.S. dispatching an </p><p>assessment team to Nigeria to help determine the pre- </p><p>deployment needs of the Nigerian battalions. </p><p>Ambassador added that should President Bush decide to </p><p>send American troops, the troops could only deploy </p><p>after Taylor departed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>48 HOURS OR ELSE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Obasanjo envisioned the deployment of Nigerian </p><p>and possible other ECOWAS contingents prior to an </p><p>American arrival.  After the sub-regionals deployed, </p><p>Taylor would be given 48 hours to leave for asylum. </p><p>If he did not leave within 48 hours, "I will arrest </p><p>him," Obasanjo asserted.  (Note: Prior to the meeting </p><p>with President Obasanjo, A/DCM had a brief discussion </p><p>with Special Presidential Envoy for Conflict </p><p>Resolution, Raph Uwueche.  Ambassador Uwueche said </p><p>that he had visited Monrovia July 16 to confirm </p><p>Taylor\'s willingness to leave Liberia.  He said Taylor </p><p>continued to voice willingness to leave provided that </p><p>an orderly succession was arranged so that a power </p><p>vacuum would not ensue.  Uwueche returned to Abuja </p><p>with Liberian Minister of State Jonathan Taylor and </p><p>three other GOL officials in tow.  This quartet came </p><p>to survey Nigeria preparations for Taylor\'s exile and </p><p>report back to their embattled leader in Monrovia. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Obasanjo realizes that the pace of events on </p><p>the grounds is much more rapid than ECOWAS planning. </p><p>The events shaping Monrovia\'s fate are measured in </p><p>hours or days.  Meanwhile, ECOWAS deployment planning </p><p>has been in terms of days and weeks.  For the hundreds </p><p>of thousands of unprotected civilians in Monrovia, </p><p>their last best chance to avoid the specter of </p><p>violence and deprivation is for LURD to halt its </p><p>advance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Strong pressure must be placed on those in </p><p>Guinea and perhaps Sierra Leone who can, in turn, </p><p>pressure the LURD or stop its supply lines.  If that </p><p>can be accomplished, the pace of ECOWAS planning must </p><p>be accelerated rapidly as any cease-fire will be </p><p>fragile and inherently hard-lined.  Obasanjo </p><p>recognizes the need to bring the ECOWAS forces to bear </p><p>quickly; thus, his readiness to quickly deploy </p><p>Nigerian battalions in possible harm\'s way.  We should </p><p>applaud him for this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) For his troops to deploy, Obasanjo will be </p><p>looking for, at minimum, significant USG logistical </p><p>assistance.  He will also be knocking at our door for </p><p>future OFR-type training for five battalions.  If </p><p>Nigeria deploys in Liberia, his request for future </p><p>training will become a central aspect of future </p><p>cooperation with Nigeria in peacekeeping.  It will </p><p>also be a crucial test for Obasanjo in the eyes of his </p><p>reluctant military.  If Obasanjo fails to deliver on </p><p>the additional training, his stature will diminish in </p><p>the eyes of a reluctant military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.
