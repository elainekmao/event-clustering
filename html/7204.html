<p>S E C R E T GUATEMALA 000927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR DAVID WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESSES TORTURE CASE WITH MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE MORAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 770 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 884 </p><p>     C. GUATEMALA 801 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Ambassador called on Minister of Defense </p><p>Robin Moran on April 3 to emphasize that resorting to illegal </p><p>detention and torture as appears to have occurred in the </p><p>March 6 drug seizure in Rio Hondo, Zacapa is totally </p><p>unacceptable.  Moran clearly understood that these methods </p><p>put Guatemala\'s recertification at risk.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Following up on similar calls on President Portillo </p><p>(ref A) and the Minister of Interior (ref B), the Ambassador </p><p>made clear to Moran that attempting to fight drugs in this </p><p>way is not only counter-productive, it is wrong on every </p><p>count.  Such methods are unnecessary and hugely prejudicial </p><p>to the GOG\'s efforts to be certified as a fully cooperating </p><p>partner on drugs.  The Ambassador reminded Moran that similar </p><p>(albeit, more serious) abuses last year by the former </p><p>anti-narcotics police (DOAN) in the Chocon case were a major </p><p>reason for decertification as well as the Embassy\'s decision </p><p>to severely restrict its assistance to the DOAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  The Ambassador told Moran that there were strong </p><p>allegations that the military (as opposed to police) were </p><p>responsible for the abuses.  He added that the personnel </p><p>involved appear to have planted drugs on the three people </p><p>detained and that, too, is totally unacceptable. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Moran, who had clearly anticipated the purpose of the </p><p>Ambassador\'s visit, started to make a lame defense, but </p><p>decided better to drop it.  Moran said that he had already </p><p>given strict orders limiting the military\'s role in the </p><p>counter-narcotics effort to providing transportation to </p><p>police and prosecutors and to providing perimeter security </p><p>when an operation is mounted. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Moran seemed to clearly understand that the </p><p>abusive methods evidenced in the Zacapa seizure put </p><p>recertification at risk.  If not for the Zacapa incident, </p><p>Moran might have hoped for congratulations from the </p><p>Ambassador due to recent successes involving effective </p><p>military support for counter-narcotics police operations (ref </p><p>C) that demonstrate the type of results possible with proper </p><p>cooperation.  Instead, the Ambassador treated Moran to a </p><p>close inspection of the military\'s black-eye over this </p><p>incident. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
