<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PPD, JGAFFNEY; NSC FOR MDUNNE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, OPRC, OIIP, KWWW, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: PORTRAYAL OF THE WAR IN KUWAIT\'S STATE MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>1. After months of public hedging and equivocation for the </p><p>benefit of the media and the Arab League, the GOK has come </p><p>out in strong support for the war on Iraq, and Kuwaiti </p><p>public opinion is following its lead. Embassy has received </p><p>hundreds of calls expressing support from ordinary Kuwaitis, </p><p>many of whom are leaving floral bouquets and letters at the </p><p>embassy gate, and editorials overwhelmingly support the US </p><p>and coalition attack.  Not surprisingly, this perspective is </p><p>reflected in Kuwait\'s state-run media. </p><p> </p><p>2. Kuwait TV (KTV) and the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) are the </p><p>only government-controlled media in the country, and offer </p><p>voluble support for coalition efforts. KTV, for example, </p><p>regularly refers to the campaign as "the war to liberate </p><p>Iraq." Illustrative of KTV\'s coverage is a series of </p><p>interviews with Iraqi refugee families in Jordan entitled </p><p>"Where Are We Now?" The families, living in squalid camp </p><p>conditions, tell the interviewer it is better than what they </p><p>experienced under Saddam\'s regime. KTV also has broadcast </p><p>several interviews with Iraqi opposition figures, and both </p><p>KTV and KUNA have focused in recent days on humanitarian aid </p><p>efforts in Iraq, including a Kuwaiti aid shipment and </p><p>assistance in extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Although Kuwait\'s Arabic press is not government-owned </p><p>or controlled, the same pro-war sentiment is evident in </p><p>newspaper reportage and op/eds.  Commentators harshly </p><p>criticize Arab states and publics for attacking the </p><p>coalition, and editorial opinion reflects bitterness that </p><p>Arab public opinion offers no sympathy for Kuwait as a </p><p>victim of Iraqi surface to surface missiles. In this </p><p>context, there is no ambiguity about where the majority of </p><p>Kuwaitis stand in terms of the war on Iraq, and no daylight </p><p>between official and commercial media on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
