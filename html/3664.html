<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001664 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM THE CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  09/09/12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 126 (09-09-02) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE LEWIS AMSELEM.  REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS: PM SCHEDULE IN NY </p><p>          PRO-PEACE MARCH </p><p>          CONFUSION RE PROPOSED AMENDMENT </p><p>          NORWEGIAN AMB RE TALKS </p><p>          MALDIVES: ATTEMPTED HIJACKING </p><p> </p><p>PM MEETING IN NY </p><p>---------------- </p><p>1.  (SBU) Milinda Moragoda called Charge today to check </p><p>whether a U.S. principal could attend a GSL-proposed </p><p>meeting hosted by the GSL that would include PM </p><p>Wickremesinghe, the Norwegian FM, Kofi Annan, and a U.S. </p><p>rep such as D.  (Note:  Per our class e-mails to you, </p><p>Moragoda had mentioned the idea of such a meeting to us </p><p>late last week.)  The precise timeframe of the proposed </p><p>meeting has not yet been set, but the GSL\'s plan is to </p><p>have it take place in the September 15-17 timeframe.  We </p><p>are not sure how much the proposed meeting has been </p><p>worked with the UN yet.  The purpose of the meeting would </p><p>be to underscore international support for the Sri Lankan </p><p>peace process.  What advice should we give Moragoda on </p><p>which U.S. official might be able attend?  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRO-PEACE MARCH </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2.  (C) The UNP is sponsoring a pro-peace process march </p><p>in Colombo today.  It\'s supposed to be quite large.  The </p><p>GSL apparently wants to remain well ahead of the curve </p><p>vis-a-vis any possible protests against its lifting of </p><p>the ban on the LTTE.  So far, the JVP and anti-LTTE </p><p>deproscription elements in the PA have remained </p><p>relatively muted in their criticisms.  We expect the JVP </p><p>might try to mobilize some street actions (rallies, </p><p>demos) soon, however.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>CONFUSION RE PROPOSED AMENDMENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) We have heard reports that the GSL plans to table </p><p>in Parliament soon its much discussed constitutional </p><p>amendment limiting presidential powers to call new </p><p>elections.  There is some confusion as to whether or not </p><p>the draft amendment will also include language allowing </p><p>for crossover voting in Parliament.  There is also </p><p>confusion as to whether President Kumaratunga will </p><p>concede and support the amendment in the end.  We\'ll </p><p>report more as things get clearer, but wanted you to know </p><p>that it appears we\'re at make-or-break time re the </p><p>proposed amendment.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>NORWEGIAN AMB RE TALKS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) Please pass to EUR/NB and EAP/BCLTV:  Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Westborg told Charge today that he did not </p><p>expect the September 16-18 talks in Thailand to be too </p><p>substantive at this point.  The focus of the two sides </p><p>would be establishing cordial atmospherics and agreement </p><p>on modalities, i.e., settling on the structure, agenda, </p><p>and date for future talks.  There also would be some </p><p>discussion re development-related issues, such as </p><p>demining, etc.  The sides seem set to issue a joint call </p><p>for international humanitarian and demining assistance at </p><p>the close of the meeting.  Westborg reported that the GSL </p><p>for its part would not mind discussing substantive </p><p>issues, but the LTTE has indicated that it is not ready </p><p>yet.  One reason it is apparently not ready is that </p><p>Balasingham has not yet received his detailed briefing </p><p>from Prabhakaran on the way forward.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES: ATTEMPTED HIJACKING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>5.  (U) We have sent front-channel reports re the </p><p>attempted hijacking of an Air Seychelles flight near the </p><p>Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
