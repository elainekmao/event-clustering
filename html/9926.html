<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLITICAL ROUNDUP AUGUST 6 </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAWN M. LIBERI; REASON: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.    (U) THIS PERIODIC JOINT POLITICAL REPORT FROM ABUJA </p><p>INCLUDES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Obasanjo Chooses Special Advisors </p><p>--Obasanjo Submits List of Ministers </p><p>--Electoral Conference ) INEC Admits Problems </p><p>--Opposition Book Launch </p><p>--Court Case on the Presidential Election </p><p>--Probe of Inspector General of Police </p><p>--New AD Chairman </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Obasanjo Chooses Special Advisors </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) President Obasanjo has chosen thirteen Special </p><p>Advisors, many of which are former Ministers in the previous </p><p>Obasanjo Administration.  Obasanjo retained National Security </p><p>Advisor Lt. General Aliyu Mohammed-Gusau and Dr. Rilwanu </p><p>Lukman as his Special Advisor for Petroleum and Energy.  NSA </p><p>Mohammed is an ally of former Head of State Babangida and had </p><p>not been in Obasanjo,s good graces because of his divided </p><p>loyalties.  However, Obasanjo kept Mohammed despite the </p><p>latter,s attempt to resign months ago.  Obasanjo probably </p><p>figured out it was better to hold Mohammed near than let him </p><p>go because Mohammed knows many of the weaknesses in the </p><p>Presidency that Obasanjo would rather not see come to light </p><p>or be exploited.  Additionally, Mohammed,s and Babangida,s </p><p>ambitions for 2007 now collide with Vice President Atiku. </p><p>Retaining Mohammed may be seen as a way to help check </p><p>Atiku,s desires.  Dr. Lukman is a highly respected face in </p><p>the international oil community and his retention serves to </p><p>satisfy this important constituency that Nigeria will remain </p><p>a consistent team player in OPEC.  Obasanjo selected PDP </p><p>Chairman Audu Ogbeh as his Advisor on Agriculture.  Ogbeh </p><p>also will remain the party,s chairman.  Obasanjo also </p><p>selected recently ousted Alliance for Democracy Chairman </p><p>Alhaji Ahmed Abdulkadir as Advisor on Manufacturing and the </p><p>Private Sector.  Obasanjo selected ANPP presidential aspirant </p><p>Chief Rochas Okorocha as his advisor on Inter-Party Affairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Obasanjo also selected several ministers from his </p><p>pervious cabinet as advisors, including: Jerry Gana (Minister </p><p>of Information and National Orientation) as Advisor on </p><p>Politics; Ojo Maduekwe (Minister of Transportation) as </p><p>Advisor on Constitutional and Legal Matters; Kanu Agabi </p><p>(Attorney General) as Advisor on Ethics and Good Governance; </p><p>Mallam Lawal Batagarawa (Minister of State for Defense) as </p><p>Advisor on Non-Party Relations; Mohammed Abba Gana (Minister </p><p>of the FCT) as Advisor on Relations with Civil Society. </p><p>(COMMENT: The naming of so many former ministers poses an </p><p>interesting question that can only be answered as time </p><p>unfolds.  Is Obasanjo trying to strengthen his covey of </p><p>advisors in order to run the government from the Presidency </p><p>or are these sinecures, political favors for past services? </p><p>END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Obasanjo Submits List of Ministers </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo submitted his list of 40 names for </p><p>ministerial positions to the National Assembly (bios sent </p><p>septel).  In an unorthodox twist, Obasanjo did not assign any </p><p>portfolios when he submitted the roster for National Assembly </p><p>confirmation.  This undermined the confirmation process by </p><p>forcing the Assembly to screen applicants based on their </p><p>general merits and not specific technical expertise or </p><p>experience.  Additionally undermining the process was the </p><p>practice that nominees who were former Senators were </p><p>basically not questioned, due to senatorial etiquette and </p><p>custom.  Several of the forty were senators at some point in </p><p>their political careers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Diminishing the important legislative oversight of the </p><p>executive, Obasanjo,s tack in not identifying the portfolios </p><p>indicates his continued disregard for the Assembly.  It also </p><p>deprives the nominations of full meaning by treating the </p><p>nominees as if they were interchangeable parts, it makes them </p><p>seem less important.  The President has been quoted several </p><p>times in the press that loyalty is the best attribute of a </p><p>minister.  Such statements only add to the impression that </p><p>Obasanjo basically views his cabinet as administrators to </p><p>follow his orders and less as advisors and equals who will </p><p>help shape his policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The federal constitution mandates that there must be a </p><p>minimum of 36 ministers representing each of the 36 states. </p><p>Of the 40 candidates put forth all but one have been approved </p><p>by the National Assembly, with one name dropped from the </p><p>list.  The Assembly rejected former Minister of Education </p><p>Babalola Borishade, and Obasanjo has since resubmitted the </p><p>name, stating that the Senate did not give a reason for the </p><p>dismissal.  Obasanjo dropped Adewale Oladipo, who had been </p><p>linked to the murder of former Attorney General Ige, from the </p><p>list without explanation. </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Electoral Conference ) INEC Admits Problems </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) At the opening of a post-election review conference </p><p>held in Kaduna for three days this week, INEC Chairman Abel </p><p>Guobadia admitted to serious flaws in this year,s elections, </p><p>but stated that the elections overall were credible.  Showing </p><p>that bitterness over the elections has not receded, the major </p><p>opposition parties, including the ANPP and APGA, boycotted </p><p>the seminar.  Guobadia accepted the constructive criticism of </p><p>various international and domestic observer groups. (NOTE: </p><p>This is a reversal of his stance immediately after the </p><p>elections. END NOTE) While his admission of flaws was seen as </p><p>an honest, but late acknowledgement, Guobadia,s claim that </p><p>INEC improved between the National Assembly elections on </p><p>April 12 and the Presidential and Gubernatorial elections on </p><p>April 19 found few supporters inside or outside the </p><p>conference.  The conference was intended to explore methods </p><p>of improving future elections, including the revision of the </p><p>electoral law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Opposition Book Launch </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Conference of Nigerian Political Parties, a </p><p>grouping of opposition parties including the ANPP and APGA, </p><p>held a book launching on July 29.  The three books released </p><p>are "Stolen Mandate," "The Madness Called Election 2003," and </p><p>"Buhari Goes to Court."  In attendance were ANPP presidential </p><p>candidate Mohammedu Buhari, his running mate, Chuba Okadigbo, </p><p>the APGA National Chairman, CNPP Chairman Balarabe Musa, and </p><p>others from various opposition parties.  They contended that </p><p>the continuing Anambra crisis is not only a testimony that </p><p>elections did not hold in the Southeast, but also that it </p><p>marks "the beginning of the end of PDP government." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Court Case on the Presidential Election </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The Federal Court of Appeal ) -- the court of first </p><p>instance for a petition against the presidential election ) </p><p>-- rejected the Presidency,s motion to dismiss Buhari,s </p><p>suit against the April 19 presidential election.  With the </p><p>motion to dismiss out of the way, the case is one step closer </p><p>to a hearing on the substantive merits of the case, that </p><p>Obasanjo,s victory was due to electoral malpractice. </p><p>Substantive arguments begin this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Probe of Inspector General of Police </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Inspector General Tafa Balogun has come increasingly </p><p>under fire in the last several weeks since the temporary </p><p>abduction of Anambra State Governor Chris Ngige.  As the </p><p>reverberations from Ngige,s ordeal continue to hold the </p><p>country,s attention, Obasanjo has ordered a probe, including </p><p>any role played by Balogun.  Unlike other various allegations </p><p>of police corruption or involvement in official misconduct, </p><p>this probe will be by the State Security Service.  Balogun </p><p>will have no control over any aspect of the investigation, an </p><p>indication that Obasanjo may be preparing to cut him loose. </p><p>The timing is especially bad for Balogun who is also </p><p>defending against allegations that he collected N35 million </p><p>from Delta Governor James Ibori to cover up a previous </p><p>criminal conviction, something that would have barred him </p><p>from the gubernatorial seat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>New AD Chairman </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The National Executive Committee of the AD on July 22 </p><p>removed Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmed as National Chairman.  Former </p><p>Osun State Governor, Chief Bisi Akande, is the new chairman, </p><p>and will remain in charge until the party can hold a national </p><p>convention in September.  This step follows on Abdulkadir,s </p><p>acceptance of the post of Special Advisor on Manufacturing </p><p>and the Private Sector.  Abdulkadir had drawn ire from within </p><p>the party for being too close to Obasanjo prior to the </p><p>elections and accepting defeat too easily, when the party </p><p>lost five of six state governors.  In response, Abdulkadir </p><p>has stated that he has not resigned from the AD, and says he </p><p>cannot be removed without a national conference. </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
