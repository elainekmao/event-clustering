SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  AT THE INSTIGATION OF </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT CHAIR OF THE FAO COUNCIL, A GROUP WILL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02188  061414Z </p><p>MEET INFORMALLY MAY 18 TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE DRAFT </p><p>DECLARATION FOR THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS LATER. </p><p>GUIDANCE REQUESTED NO LATER THAN MAY 16 ON THE DRAFT TEXT </p><p>FOR USE DURING THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT  A LUNCHEON MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF FAO\'S </p><p>SEVEN REGIONAL GROUPS, CHAIRED BY THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE FAO COUNCIL, IT WAS DECIDED TO MEET AT </p><p>THE FAO ON MAY 18 TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE TEXT OF A </p><p>DRAFT DECLARATION FOR THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS </p><p>LATER (WFS5YL).  THE STARTING POINT IS THE HEAVILY </p><p>BRACKETED DRAFT THAT WAS LEFT UNFINISHED WHEN THE OPEN- </p><p>ENDED WORKING GROUP (OEWG) LAST MET IN JUNE, 2001.  THE </p><p>COMPOSITION OF THE MEETING WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION </p><p>OF THE OEWG AND THE TWO CO-CHAIRS ARE TO REPRESENT BOTH </p><p>THE G-77 AND OECD GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SEVERAL DELEGATIONS (AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL) HAVE </p><p>PUSHED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO ADVANCE NEGOTIATION OF THE TEXT </p><p>OF THE DECLARATION IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE EARLIER THAN HAD </p><p>BEEN AGREED LAST NOVEMBER, I.E. BY THE COMMITTEE ON FOOD </p><p>SECURITY (CFS) JUNE 6-8.  OTHER GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE </p><p>EUROPEAN REGION, HAVE INSISTED THAT THE TIMETABLE AGREED </p><p>TO AT THE LAST COUNCIL BE RESPECTED. SEVERAL REGIONAL </p><p>GROUPS HAVE CONSULTED INTERNALLY, BUT TO DATE THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN NO EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AMONG THE GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE EU HAS EXAMINED THE DECLARATION AT THE EXPERT </p><p>LEVEL IN BRUSSELS AND STARTED A SERIES OF CONSULTATIONS </p><p>WITH OTHER GROUPS IN ROME, BUT HAS NOT AGREED AMONG </p><p>MEMBER STATES ON A FINAL TEXT.  THEY MEET AGAIN IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02188  061414Z </p><p>BRUSSELS MAY 15. THE EU HAS IDENTIFIED PARAS 8, 12, 13, </p><p>15, 16, 17, 19 AND 21 AS PROBLEMATIC. </p><p> </p><p>5. PROGRESS IS MIXED ON AMONG THE G-77 GROUPS.  THE LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN GROUP REPORTEDLY HAS AGREED ON A TEXT, BUT </p><p>OTHERS IN THE G-77 ARE STILL STAKING OUT THE GROUND </p><p>RULES.  THE MIDDLE EAST GROUP PROPOSED DISCUSSION OF </p><p>BRACKETED TEXT ONLY, REJECTING PROPOSALS TO INTRODUCE NEW </p><p>LANGUAGE.  THE CO-CHAIR FROM THE AFRICA GROUP EXPRESSED </p><p>THE VIEW THAT THE OEWG IS CLOSE TO AGREEMENT ON MANY </p><p>POINTS BUT NEEDS TIME FOR DISCUSSION.  THE ASIA GROUP IS </p><p>DIVIDED BETWEEN THOSE WHO PREFER TO STICK TO THE AGREED </p><p>TIMETABLE AND THOSE PUSHING FOR ADVANCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHILE THE EU, US AND AUSTRALIA STRESSED THAT SUCH A </p><p>MEETING SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A NEGOTIATION, </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES AGREED AN INFORMAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS </p><p>WOULD FACILITATE PREPARATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE ON FOOD </p><p>SECURITY WHICH MEETS JUNE 6-8.  ALTHOUGH IT WAS AGREED </p><p>THERE SHOULD BE TWO CO-CHAIRS, THE MAIN STICKING POINT </p><p>THAT REMAINS IS WHO WILL REPRESENT THE OECD SIDE. </p><p>(IRANIAN AMBASSADOR NOORI NAEENI WILL CHAIR FOR THE G- </p><p>77).  THE IRISH REPRESENTATIVE WHO CHAIRED THE CFS AND </p><p>OEWG IS NOT ABLE TO COME TO ROME IN ADVANCE OF JUNE.  THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT CHAIR SUGGESTED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PROGRAM </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHO IS FROM THE NETHERLANDS, BUT HE WILL NOT </p><p>BE AVAILABLE.  ANOTHER SUGGESTION WAS THAT THE U.S. </p><p>(ACTING PERM REP),AS A MEMBER OF THE CFS BUREAU, CO-CHAIR </p><p>THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACTION REQUEST: DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE REQUESTED ON THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02188  061414Z </p><p>TEXT OF THE DRAFT DECLARATION FOR USE DURING THE INFORMAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS MAY 17.  OF PARTICULAR USE WOULD BE: </p><p>---INDICATIONS OF WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TEXT </p><p>REPLACED WITH LANGUAGE DRAWN FROM ANOTHER AGREED TEXT </p><p>(E.G., THE MONTERREY OUTCOME ON FINANCING OR THE DOHA </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE NEW TRADE ROUND); </p><p>-- INDICATIONS OF TEXT WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE THERE WILL BE STRONG PRESSURE TO REFRAIN FROM </p><p>INTRODUCING NEW PARAGRAPHS, THE INFORMAL MEETING WILL BE </p><p>THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO FLOAT ANY NEW TOPICS WHICH WE MAY </p><p>WISH TO SEE COVERED IN THE DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE ALSO REQUESTED ON U.S. CO- </p><p>CHAIRING WITH AMBASSADOR NOORI NAEENI THE INFORMAL </p><p>EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON MAY 18. HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02188 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
