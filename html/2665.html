A) STATE 53938 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) STATE 51363 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMIN COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ITALY DOUBTS THE REMOVAL OF DG BUSTANI WILL BE SETTLED </p><p>BY THE OPCW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND EXPECTS IT WILL HAVE TO </p><p>BE RESOLVED AT THE STATES PARTIES MEETING THIS FALL, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MFA ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>ALESSANDRO CEVESE.  CEVESE MET WITH POL-MIL OFFICER JUST </p><p>AFTER TALKING WITH ITALY\'S OPCW REPRESENTATIVE ON MARCH 21. </p><p>ITALY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE NO CONFIDENCE MOTION, CEVESE </p><p>SAID, BUT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN VERY DIVISIVE FOR THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND COULD END UP BEING COSTLY AS WELL. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01461  211803Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CEVESE MENTIONED ONE THEORY CURRENTLY CIRCULATING THAT </p><p>THE U.S. EFFORT TO REMOVE BUSTANI IS AN ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THE </p><p>OPCW IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE AUSTRALIA GROUP.  WHILE ITALY </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT BUSTANI\'S REMOVAL IS SOUGHT AS A MEANS OF </p><p>RESTORING THE OPCW\'S VIABILITY, SOME COUNTRIES SUSPECT THE </p><p>U.S. HAS OTHER MOTIVES, CEVESE COMMENTED.  RUMOURS THAT THE </p><p>U.S. MIGHT NOT PAY ITS CONTRIBUTION OR MIGHT PRESSURE THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION TO CEASE OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IF </p><p>BUSTANI IS NOT REMOVED UNDERMINE U.S. STATEMENTS THAT ITS </p><p>OBJECTIVE IS TO STRENGTHN THE OPCW, HE SAID.  THE GOI WOULD </p><p>BE VERY CONCERNED IF THE U.S. IS CONSIDERING EITHER OF THESE </p><p>OPTIONS, ACCORDING TO CEVESE. SUCH ACTIONS WOULD FURTHER </p><p>DELAY DECISIONS ON RESOLVING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS FACING THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  ITALY AGREES WITH THE U.S. THAT BUSTANI\'S </p><p>RESIGNATION IS NECESSARY, CEVESE SAID, BUT LINKING HIS </p><p>REMOVAL TO CONTRIBUTIONS PAYMENTS OR THE OPCW OPERATION WOULD </p><p>BE A SERIOUS MISTAKE.  HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ITALY INTENDS TO </p><p>PAY ITS CONTRIBUTION WHETHER OR NOT BUSTANI IS REMOVED. </p><p>POL-MIL OFFICER, DRAWING FROM REFS A, B AND OTHERS, </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO THE CWC AND THE OPCW, AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT STRENGTHENING THE ORGANIZATION IS THE ONLY </p><p>MOTIVE BEHIND U.S. ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT.  THE GOI SUPPORTS A NO CONFIDENCE MOTION </p><p>AGAINST DG BUSTANI, IN PART BECAUSE IT AGREES BUSTANI HAS </p><p>FAILED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO </p><p>BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT BUSTANI HAS LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF </p><p>THE U.S.  THAT SAID, THE ITALIANS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED </p><p>BROADER CONSULTATIONS WITH OPCW MEMBERS BEFORE THE U.S. </p><p>MOUNTED THE EFFORT TO REMOVE BUSTANI.
