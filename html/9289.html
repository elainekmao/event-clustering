<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR CATHY NOVELLI </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/DAS WILLIAMSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, SN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN/SINGAPORE:  US FTA PARTNERS LINK UP? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  This is a joint Embassy Singapor/Embassy Amman cable. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Summary:  Singapore Trade Minister George Yeo </p><p>passed King Abdullah a letter from Prime Minister Goh Chok </p><p>Yong on the margins of the World Economic Forum proposing a </p><p>Free Trade Agreement between Jordan and Singapore. </p><p>Jordanian officials have been warmly receptive to the </p><p>proposal, which they see as offering future opportunities for </p><p>cooperation in a diverse range of economic sectors, from </p><p>textiles to tourism to info tech.   Singapore trade officials </p><p>say an FTA with Jordan can support liberalization efforts in </p><p>the Middle East.   Another, unstated, objective may be to </p><p>reassure Singapore\'s Muslim minority of the government\'s </p><p>concern for their middle eastern co-religionists, especially </p><p>after Singapore\'s public endorsement of Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom.   In the short term, the effects of any FTA will </p><p>probably be modest, as trade between the two countries </p><p>currently stands at only about $26 million.   Singapore has </p><p>completed or is negotiating bilateral FTAs with a diverse </p><p>range of countries, including Japan, New Zealand, Australia, </p><p>the European Free Trade Association, the US, Mexico, Canada, </p><p>India, and Chile.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  In an audience with King Abdullah on the margins of </p><p>the Dead Sea World Economic Forum June 23, Singapore Trade </p><p>Minister George Yeo presented a letter from Singapore\'s PM </p><p>Goh proposing a bilateral free trade agreement with Jordan. </p><p>According to Jordanian press reports, the agreement would </p><p>include an investment framework agreement and would </p><p>facilitate cooperation in e-government, information </p><p>technology, port management, and tourism, and would remove </p><p>barriers to trade in both goods and services.  The agreement </p><p>between a current and a future U.S. FTA partner would be </p><p>Jordan\'s first with an East Asian country, as well as </p><p>Singapore\'s first with a country in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Jordanian officials have been cautiously positive </p><p>about the proposal.  Trade Minister Salah Bashir told Amman </p><p>ECON/C that such an agreement with a major global IT player </p><p>could open the door to IT investments or joint ventures with </p><p>Singaporean partners, as well as technology transfer </p><p>possibilities.  Bashir cautioned, though, that any FTA with </p><p>Singapore would have to include strong anti-circumvention </p><p>mechanisms, to guard against the agreement being exploited </p><p>for the surreptitious entry of Chinese goods into Singapore, </p><p>Jordan, or the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  A senior Singapore trade official told Singapore </p><p>acting E/P Couns that the Middle East is an important region, </p><p>but one where Singapore\'s economic engagement has been </p><p>minimal. The official said an FTA with Jordan would help to </p><p>correct this, and could act as a catalyst for further </p><p>liberalization elsewhere in the region.   He said Yeo had </p><p>briefed USTR Zoellick on the initiative.  Separately, Yeo </p><p>commented to acting E/P Couns that a possible FTA with Jordan </p><p>had initially been raised by then USTR Barshefsky, when the </p><p>U.S. and Singapore were planning to use the US-Jordan FTA as </p><p>a model for the US-Singapore FTA.  Yeo said he had asked </p><p>Singapore\'s Ambassador to Washington to "let Charlene know </p><p>that we\'re doing this." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment:  Current Jordan-Singapore trade is very </p><p>small, about $26 million annually.  Nevertheless, there is a </p><p>certain logic to the initiative:  Jordan likes to picture </p><p>itself as the "Singapore of the Middle East," having, to some </p><p>extent, modeled its open trade and investment policies on </p><p>Singapore\'s.  The key difference is that Jordan is not </p><p>surrounded by large, relatively prosperous neighbors.  Jordan </p><p>has also focused its investment promotion activities on </p><p>companies, often high-tech firms from Asia, wanting to use </p><p>Jordan\'s FTA with the U.S. and Partnership Agreement with the </p><p>EU as hubs for access to these large consumer markets.  An </p><p>FTA with Singapore could build on this in Asia. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Comment continued:  While a Jordan FTA might also </p><p>improve Singapore\'s access to Middle East markets as progress </p><p>is made on a regional FTA and on cumulation agreements within </p><p>the region, Singapore more likely views its offer as a </p><p>political tool - a way to show the country\'s Muslim minority </p><p>that the government, despite strong public support for the </p><p>war against Saddam Hussein and defense links to Israel, is </p><p>concerned about promoting economic prosperity among Muslims </p><p>in the middle east.   Singapore is unlikely to be too </p><p>ambitious with an FTA with Jordan; most of Singapore\'s </p><p>existing FTAs, with the exception of that with the US (and to </p><p>some extent that with Australia), offer little new </p><p>liberalization beyond the status quo.   End comment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
