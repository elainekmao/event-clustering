IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) IN AN INTERVIEW IN THE MAY 4-10 ISSUE OF THE </p><p>PRO-RULING PARTY NEWSPAPER "THE ZIMBABWE MIRROR", THE </p><p>MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL </p><p>HOUSING, IGNATIUS CHOMBO, ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) HAD RECENTLY INITIATED A NEW PHASE OF </p><p>THE "FAST-TRACK" LAND REFORM PROGRAM, CALLED "ULTRA </p><p>FAST-TRACK", WITH THE INTENT OF RESETTLING 35,000 PEOPLE </p><p>ON COMMERCIAL FARMS BY THE END OF MAY.  THERE WAS NO </p><p>EXPLANATION GIVEN IN THE ARTICLE REGARDING HOW THE GOZ </p><p>WAS GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, GIVEN THE WIDESPREAD </p><p>DISORGANIZATION, LACK OF PLANNING AND CORRUPTION THAT </p><p>HAS CHARACTERIZED "FAST-TRACK" UP TO NOW.  CHOMBO ALSO </p><p>STATED IN THE INTERVIEW THAT THE GOZ MIGHT NOW </p><p>COMPULSORILY ACQUIRE UP TO EIGHT MILLION HECTARES OF </p><p>LAND FROM WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  EVEN THIS WAS NOT A </p><p>FINAL LIMIT AS HE ADDED, "WE WILL SETTLE PEOPLE AS LONG </p><p>AS THERE IS A NEED TO REDISTRIBUTE THE LAND." </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) MINISTER CHOMBO IS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON LAND RESETTLEMENT.  IN </p><p>THIS ROLE, AND AS PART OF HIS CABINET PORTFOLIO, HE HAS </p><p>BEEN THE POINT MAN ON GOZ PLANS FOR PHYSICALLY </p><p>RESETTLING THE PEOPLE ON THE OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p>IN THE INTERVIEW, HE STATED THAT THE GOZ EXPECTS THE </p><p>RESETTLED PEOPLE TO BEGIN BUILDING PROPER, PERMANENT </p><p>HOUSING FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT THE TEMPORARY HUTS THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01583  111104Z </p><p>THE OCCUPIERS HAVE BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE INVASIONS </p><p>BEGAN IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR.  HE ALSO STATES THAT THE </p><p>RESETTLED PEOPLE ARE TO PLAN THOROUGHLY SO THAT THEY </p><p>ESTABLISH PROPER VILLAGES WITH RUNNING WATER, </p><p>ELECTRICITY, TOILETS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p>HOWEVER, NOWHERE IN THE INTERVIEW DOES HE MENTION PLANS </p><p>FOR THE GOZ TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT TO THE RESETTLED PEOPLE TO </p><p>ENABLE THEM TO BUILD NEW HOMES AND MODERN VILLAGES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE MAY 4-10 EDITION OF THE "ZIMBABWE </p><p>INDEPENDENT" NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE MOST RECENT </p><p>LISTING OF FARMS THAT THE GOZ HAS GAZETTED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION INCLUDES SOME OF ZIMBABWE\'S MOST </p><p>PRODUCTIVE COFFEE AND TEA ESTATES, AS WELL AS PIECES OF </p><p>LAND IN THE EASTERN HIGHLANDS OF THE COUNTRY ON WHICH </p><p>ARE LOCATED TOURIST HOTELS AND TIMBER FARMS.  THE LIST </p><p>ALSO INCLUDES LAND ALREADY OWNED BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND RURAL COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE ZIMBABWE COUNCIL OF TOURISM, PEDIA MOYO, STATED </p><p>THAT IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE FOR THE GOZ TO ATTEMPT TO </p><p>RESETTLE PEOPLE IN THE MOUNTAINOUS EASTERN HIGHLANDS. </p><p>SHE POINTED OUT THAT, "RESETTLED FARMERS WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>SPECIALIZE IN GROWING PINE, WATTLE, OR OTHER SUCH TREES </p><p>FROM WHICH THEY WILL ONLY REALIZE A RETURN AFTER ABOUT </p><p>20 YEARS." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THE NEW "ULTRA FAST-TRACK" PLAN, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE LATEST LIST OF PROPERTIES GAZETTED FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION, AMPLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GOZ HAS NO </p><p>RATIONAL OR THOUGHT-OUT PLAN FOR LAND REFORM OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01583  111104Z </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  THE IDEA THAT THE GOZ CAN RESETTLE 35,000 </p><p>PEOPLE BY THE END OF MAY IS PATENTLY ABSURD.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>CLEAR FROM THIS SKETCHY PLAN THAT RESETTLED PEOPLE WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES FOR BUILDING HOMES </p><p>AND ESTABLISHING VILLAGES.  GIVEN THAT THE PEOPLE BEING </p><p>RESETTLED ARE BY THE GOZ\'S OWN ADMISSION POOR AND </p><p>LANDLESS, IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE </p><p>TO CONSTRUCT MORE THAN THE MOST RUDIMENTARY STRUCTURES, </p><p>MEANING THE MUD AND WOOD THATCHED HUTS THEY HAVE BEEN </p><p>BUILDING TO THIS POINT.  THE LISTING OF PROPERTIES WITH </p><p>TOURIST FACILITIES ON THEM INDICATES THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>EITHER BLINDLY LISTING PROPERTIES, OR THAT SUCH </p><p>PROPERTIES MAY NOW BE VIEWED AS POLITICAL PATRONAGE </p><p>PLUMS FOR TRUE SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING PARTY.  THE </p><p>LIKELY TRUTH IS THAT BOTH FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR SUCH </p><p>LISTINGS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
