(SBU) The USG and the World Bank are planning to hold the </p><p>ministerial-level Regional Trade Initiative Conference on the </p><p>margins of the IMF/WB Annual Meetings in Dubai from September </p><p>21-23, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The interagency community is considering a proper </p><p>venue to conduct a preliminary planning meeting on the </p><p>Regional Trade Initiative in the June/July timeframe.  Post </p><p>proposes that the USG consider  working with an existing </p><p>regional body, the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), </p><p>to convene this meeting.  The ECO is already scheduled to </p><p>hold a Trade and Investment meeting in 2003, but according to </p><p>their website, www.ecosecretariat.org, the exact date and </p><p>location have not been fixed.  If the interagency and World </p><p>Bank agree, we could proceed with a meeting in coordination </p><p>with ECO that will serve both purposes. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The ECO,s membership includes Afghanistan,s </p><p>neighbors --  Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Turkmenistan, </p><p>Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan -- along with regional countries </p><p>with a high interest in regional trade and investment regimes </p><p>like Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  For the </p><p>purposes of the regional trade initiative, observer nations </p><p>might include the U.S., India, China, an E.U. representative </p><p>and Russia. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Post defers to Washington,s judgment to determine the </p><p>feasibility of including Iran in such a conference (Iran is a </p><p>founding member of ECO ) which was founded in the 1970s by </p><p>Turkey, Iran and Pakistan).  There is, however, a strong case </p><p>to be made that any regional trade initiative intended to </p><p>enhance, legalize and regularize regional trade and </p><p>investment flows must by definition include Iran.  The </p><p>alternative is to give Iran (and its proxies in Afghanistan) </p><p>tremendous leverage to serve as a spoiler ) through </p><p>smuggling and other extra-legal commercial activities ) of </p><p>any regional trade initiative program we can develop. </p><p>HANSON </p><p></p></div>
