The </p><p>reform package gained the backing of both the ruling AKP and </p><p>opposition CHP.  Article 8 of the anti-terror law, which </p><p>bans separatist political propaganda, was abolished by the </p><p>new legislation.  Broadcasts in languages other than Turkish </p><p>will be allowed, and the ban on Kurdish names has been </p><p>removed.  Papers regard the only shortcoming of the package </p><p>as the removal of the clause allowing foreign observers to </p><p>monitor elections in Turkey.  Dailies hail the swift </p><p>enactment of EU reforms, which moved Turkey `one step closer </p><p>to the EU.\'  Papers believe the EU will provide `generous\' </p><p>financial aid for Turkey to support accession preparations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA delegation\'s U.S. visit: MFA U/S Ambassador Ziyal told </p><p>the Washington Post that he was satisfied by his meetings in </p><p>Washington.  Ziyal reiterated Ankara\'s readiness for </p><p>cooperation in Iraq, and noted that Incirlik airbase could </p><p>be turned into a logistical support center for coalition </p><p>troops.  Ziyal also said that Secretary Powell has </p><p>officially invited Foreign Minister Gul to the U.S. </p><p>Islamist-oriented "Zaman" claims that the `strategic </p><p>partnership\' phrase was used by U.S. officials during the </p><p>Ziyal visit merely as a diplomatic maneuver to prevent Ziyal </p><p>from leaving Washington `empty-handed.\'  Sources close to </p><p>the U.S. Administration believe that the erosion of trust </p><p>between the two countries is deep.  Although Washington was </p><p>pleased by the messages issued by Gul at the OIC summit in </p><p>Tehran, it wants to see deeds as well as words, "Zaman" </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Investigation into AWACS sale: A parliamentary commission on </p><p>corruption has asked the Defense Industry Undersecretariat </p><p>about the details of a controversial $1.5 billion purchase </p><p>of AWACS from Boeing\'s AWACS, "Milliyet" reports on its </p><p>front page.  Boeing allegedly did not meet its obligations </p><p>under the agreement, and received an additional $180 million </p><p>in a `price adjustment.\'  "Milliyet" notes that former Prime </p><p>Minister Gul had refused to sign the agreement, which was </p><p>approved by PM Erdogan shortly after he took office. </p><p>Defense Minister Gonul allegedly said in April that Turkey </p><p>had approved the agreement in an effort to smooth relations </p><p>with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey will pay reparations to Greek Cypriot: Ankara will </p><p>comply with a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights </p><p>(ECHR) by paying $1 million in reparations for the  seizure </p><p>of the Greek Cypriot Titina Loizidou\'s private property in </p><p>Girne after Turkey occupied North Cyprus in 1974.  Dailies </p><p>point to some 3,000 pending lawsuits against Turkey on </p><p>similar grounds, which could add up to $20 billion.  Papers </p><p>see the payment as a positive step forward in Turkey\'s drive </p><p>toward EU membership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tehran `flirts\' with Turkish Alawis: "Cumhuriyet" blames </p><p>Tehran on its front page for ongoing attempts to export its </p><p>fundamentalist regime to Turkey.  Iran\'s Embassy in Ankara </p><p>has invited Turkish Alawi representatives to Tehran, the </p><p>paper reports.  A few organizations have accepted the </p><p>invitation, and Iran is continuing intensive missionary </p><p>activities in Turkey.  These efforts have resulted in </p><p>considerable support for Tehran among Turkey\'s Islamists. </p><p>Alawis are an affluent political community in Turkey, and </p><p>are well-known for their commitment to secularism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Mideast / Iran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"On the eve of a new Middle East" </p><p>Erdal Guven opined in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(6/20): "Iran is part of the `Axis of evil,\' a fact that </p><p>should not be ignored.  Iran is now becoming also a part of </p><p>a new Middle East design.  It requires no prophecy to expect </p><p>an eventual regime change in Iran. . But the US is not going </p><p>to use tactics that worked in Afghanistan and Iraq for Iran. </p><p>In the Iranian case, the US is more of an observer than an </p><p>interventionist.  The regime change process in Iran is </p><p>already working in a very healthy way, through Iran\'s </p><p>internal dynamics.  The regime continues to hold power, yet </p><p>the moral high ground belongs to its opponents.  At this </p><p>stage, the US will probably work toward strengthening the </p><p>hand of the regime\'s opponents and weakening the regime by </p><p>through secret operations.  The new Middle East is about to </p><p>be born -- from Kabul to Jerusalem, and from Iraq to Iran." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pressing Iran and Turkey" </p><p>Sami Kohen observed in mass appeal Milliyet (6/20): "The </p><p>international community is exerting intense pressure on </p><p>Iran, even though Iran\'s production of nuclear arms has yet </p><p>to be documented.  The Bush administration, just like during </p><p>the campaign against Iraq, is using the nuclear arms claim </p><p>on every possible occasion.  The interesting part of this </p><p>story comes with the EU decision to support this claim.  The </p><p>EU has joined the US campaign and started warning Iran, </p><p>including the implied threat of military force if diplomacy </p><p>fails. . Turkey shares the Western world\'s worries and </p><p>suspicion about Iran\'s nuclear program.  Iran has been asked </p><p>to demonstrate to the international community that its </p><p>nuclear program is designed for peaceful purposes, as Tehran </p><p>claims. . During U/S Ziyal\'s visit to Washington, Ankara </p><p>made it clear that Turkey is on the US side on the Iran </p><p>issue.  However, more specifics on this matter will be </p><p>worked through the efforts of the IAEA, in which Turkey is </p><p>one of 35 members." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
