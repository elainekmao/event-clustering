<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN CAMPAIGNING AQABA STYLE; INSIGHT INTO </p><p>TRIBAL POLITICS IN IRBID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) PolOff attended a luncheon in Aqaba on May 15 hosted </p><p>by Dr. Mohammed Badri, a former member of the parliament for </p><p>the Aqaba Governorate and current candidate for the June 17 </p><p>parliamentary elections.  The Aqaba governorate is composed </p><p>of one district with two Muslim seats.  Dr. Badri discussed </p><p>his competition, odds of winning the election, and campaign </p><p>strategy.  PolOff also met on May 18 with Mohammed Bataineh, </p><p>a member of one of Irbid\'s largest tribes, who was thinking </p><p>of running but decided against it. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WEAK COMPETITION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Dr. Mohammed Badri is a cardiologist by profession who </p><p>served in the former parliament and is running again in the </p><p>June 17 elections.  Upon PolOff\'s arrival in Aqaba Dr. Badri </p><p>and his unofficial "campaign manager" were eager to show off </p><p>the location of his "diwan" or campaign headquarters.  The </p><p>headquarters are located on prime Aqaba real estate on a well </p><p>traveled street.  The "diwan" is composed of several Arabic </p><p>style tents where voters can come listen to the candidate and </p><p>discuss with him what he will do for them in parliament and </p><p>to ask favors, such as monetary assistance or for help to </p><p>find employment for themselves or relatives.  Dr. Badri </p><p>explains that although there are 9 candidates competing for </p><p>Aqaba\'s two seats he considers himself and two others, Ziad </p><p>Shweikh and Bedr Riati, as serious contenders. He casually </p><p>states that Ziad Shweikh will be the other winner because </p><p>Shweikh will buy the election due to his vast wealth.  He </p><p>dismisses Riati, the Islamic Action Front candidate, by </p><p>proudly claiming that half of Riati\'s tribe is supporting </p><p>him. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CAMPAIGN STRATEGY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dr. Badri believes he will win and explained his </p><p>campaign strategy: focus on his past history of providing </p><p>free medical services and medicines to poor Aqaba residents. </p><p>His campaign slogan incorporates the GOJ\'s "Jordan First" </p><p>campaign which encourages Jordanians to focus first on </p><p>Jordanian issues and how they can all ensure that Jordan </p><p>remains a stable and viable country in a tumultuous region. </p><p>His main goals once elected will be to fight corruption, </p><p>support economic reform, provide job training to the </p><p>unemployed and support the King and his good relations with </p><p>the United States.  The only political issue in his campaign </p><p>is the Palestinian issue and he supports all efforts that </p><p>will lead to a fair and just solution.  He believes the U.S. </p><p>must play a vital role in this effort and that extremism is </p><p>fueled by Arab frustration over the Palestinian problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>WINNING VOTERS AND BRINGING THE VOTE HOME </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) To garner support and make sure the voters show up at </p><p>the polls on June 17, Dr. Badri lined up a group of </p><p>volunteers whose task is to review voter lists and choose </p><p>those names personally known to them.  They will then visit </p><p>voters at home and urge them to vote for him.  Should they </p><p>want to meet the candidate they can do so at the "diwan" or </p><p>he will visit them personally.  On election day, the </p><p>volunteers are responsible for getting the voters to the </p><p>polls.  Aqaba has 23,475 eligible voters and will have 39 </p><p>voting booths.  Dr. Badri will have representatives at each </p><p>of the voting booths.  When asked if he was planning to </p><p>participate in any debates, he responded by saying that the </p><p>people of Aqaba do not want a good speaker, they want action. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>TRIBAL INFIGHTING IRBID STYLE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) During the same week, poloff also met with Mohammed </p><p>Bataineh, member of one of the largest tribes in the northern </p><p>Irbid governorate, who told PolOff he was seriously weighing </p><p>his decision to run for parliament.  He explained how the </p><p>tribe had held an internal election to choose one candidate </p><p>to represent it in the elections.  On the day of the tribal </p><p>election, a group of voters arrived at the voting booth, a </p><p>melee erupted and the ballot box was destroyed resulting in </p><p>the annulment of the elections.  Consequently, three to four </p><p>candidates decided to run splitting the tribal vote.  In the </p><p>end, Bataineh decided not to run since splitting the vote </p><p>among the tribal members diminished his chances of winning </p><p>the election. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Jordanian politics historically have centered around </p><p>the "tribal" system in the absence of political parties.  Our </p><p>recent visits to Aqaba and Irbid indicate that tribal </p><p>influences remain powerful--though hardly simple or </p><p>monolithic. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
