(U) As requested, Post\'s responses are keyed to questions </p><p>in ref (A).  Embassy point of contact is Christina Boiler, </p><p>Political section (telephone: 90-312-455-5555; fax: </p><p>90-312-468-4775).  Boiler (rank: junior officer) spent </p><p>approximately 150 hours in preparation of this report. </p><p>Another political officer (rank FS-03) spent 30 hours and the </p><p>Political Counselor (rank: FS-01) spent roughly 10 hours in </p><p>preparation of this report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Embassy Comment </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU/NF) Embassy recommends lifting Turkey from Tier III </p><p>in the 2003 Trafficking-in-Persons (TIP) report.  GOT </p><p>initiatives over the past 12 months have demonstrated </p><p>commitment to lasting steps in the fight against TIP. </p><p>Passage of an anti-TIP law in August 2002, creation of an </p><p>inter-agency task force, and efforts to begin victim </p><p>assistance measures highlight a few of the actions GOT has </p><p>taken to prevent TIP, punish offenders, and aid victims. </p><p>Turkey has signed and ratified all international protocols </p><p>against trafficking and is working with the EU, SECI, and the </p><p>OSCE to enhance cooperation in the region to combat TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU/NF) Based upon existing information and reporting </p><p>trips to affected regions, Post finds trafficking is not </p><p>significant in scope, although it reportedly does occur. </p><p>Turkey\'s liberal visa regime towards its former Soviet bloc </p><p>neighbors obviates the need for criminal gangs to provide </p><p>travel documents or facilitate entry.  While illegal </p><p>prostitution by foreign women in Turkey is common, the </p><p>majority of our contacts--GOT officials, police, businessmen, </p><p>NGO and UN agency reps, and academics-- claim trafficked </p><p>women are a small minority of those involved in illegal </p><p>prostitution.  We continue to probe but have seen no evidence </p><p>to substantiate private reports of transit from Middle </p><p>Eastern countries through Turkey to Greece or Italy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Note </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU/NF) Much of the information contained in this report </p><p>is anecdotal evidence obtained by multiple sources </p><p>(governmental and non-governmental) in multiple interviews; </p><p>when we were able to obtain statistical facts or firm </p><p>governmental data, we have included the sources with the </p><p>information.  End note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Begin text </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU/NF) OVERVIEW: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (SBU/NF) Turkey appears to be a country of destination for </p><p>a small number of women; transit may occur.  Reports from </p><p>local officials in the Black Sea region indicate some women </p><p>may be brought into Turkey through Trabzon\'s border and then </p><p>sent to Antalya or other parts of Turkey.  No territory </p><p>within the country is outside of GOT control.  There are no </p><p>reports of forced labor or trafficking of men or children. </p><p>There are no statistics- reliable or otherwise- to indicate </p><p>the scope of the problem.  A 2002 IOM study of TIP focused </p><p>primarily upon the root causes and conditions of the problem </p><p>rather than the scope of the problem.  Sources of information </p><p>include the following: newspaper articles and journalists; </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of the Interior and the </p><p>Turkish National Police (TNP); the Ministry of Justice; the </p><p>Ministry of Labor\'s Directorate on the Status and Problems of </p><p>Women; academics; governors and subgovernors; the chief of </p><p>mission of the International Organization for Migration </p><p>(IOM); businessmen and hotel owners.  These sources are of </p><p>varying reliability; some state officials indicated </p><p>reluctance to discuss the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. (SBU/NF) Most of the foreign women engaged in illegal </p><p>prostitution or who work in the sex industry originate from </p><p>the Black Sea Region (primarily Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine </p><p>but also including Romania, Azerbaijan, and Russia).  "Mafia" </p><p>organizations from source countries are believed to </p><p>facilitate forced prostitution or trafficking.  Their Turkish </p><p>counterparts are believed to include former foreign </p><p>prostitutes.  Embassy contacts stress Turkish traffickers are </p><p>typically small, splintered groups, sometimes 2-3 </p><p>individuals, not large gangs.  These individuals are linked </p><p>usually through friendship or kinship ties rather than </p><p>business ties.  Uncorroborated reports of trafficked victims </p><p>transiting through Turkey cite Israel, Italy, and Greece as </p><p>destination countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. (SBU/NF) Anecdotal evidence indicates that the overall </p><p>numbers of foreign prostitutes in Turkey has dropped over the </p><p>past several years.  Embassy contacts cite improved economic </p><p>conditions in the source countries and improved GOT </p><p>engagement on the issue as reasons for the decline.  However, </p><p>reports have increased of former foreign prostitutes who have </p><p>gained Turkish citizenship acting as pimps or TIP organizers </p><p>to bring unwitting girls into Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (SBU/NF) A 2002 IOM trafficking study, as yet unpublished </p><p>at the time of this report, focused on the causes and </p><p>circumstances of trafficked victims into Turkey.  While GOT </p><p>has not yet provided statistical data, general observations </p><p>by the researchers found trafficking to be only a small part </p><p>of illegal prostitution.  Economic conditions of source </p><p>countries compelled women to come to Turkey in search of </p><p>work.  While some of these women came initially as "suitcase </p><p>traders," many of them willingly chose to engage in illegal </p><p>prostitution.  By some accounts, a woman could make as much </p><p>as 200 USD per night engaging in prostitution.  Following the </p><p>passage of the anti-TIP legislation in August 2002, the GOT </p><p>Records Department has begun to keep statistics on cases </p><p>filed using this law; it is believed initial statistics will </p><p>be available in late spring/early summer 2003.  Finally, a </p><p>GOT inter-agency task force is currently drafting a National </p><p>Action Plan and has tasked governors in 15 so-called high </p><p>risk provinces to identify and locate potential shelters and </p><p>to issue humanitarian visas and temporary residence permits </p><p>to TIP victims.  Once implemented, these shelters and visa </p><p>statistics will prove an invaluable resource in determining </p><p>if Turkey is or is not a major trafficking destination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (SBU/NF)  The scope of trafficking in Turkey is not known. </p><p> Numerous interviews with governmental and non-governmental </p><p>sources allow us to piece together how women may fall prey to </p><p>the traffickers, but cannot provide a basis for an estimate </p><p>as to how pervasive the problem may be.  Many women escaping </p><p>poverty in the former Eastern bloc come to Turkey knowing </p><p>that they will engage in prostitution.  Others come in </p><p>response to misleading advertisements or enticements, for </p><p>example to work as waitresses, models, dancers, or "bar </p><p>girls" and are forced into prostitution by the groups who </p><p>enticed them to come to Turkey initially.  While a few of </p><p>these women have obtained work permits through tourism or </p><p>labor agencies that turn out to be fronts for traffickers, </p><p>many women enter Turkey through a valid tourist visa. </p><p>Reports say that TIP victims\' passports are usually </p><p>confiscated upon entry by traffickers.  In cases where women </p><p>come on a tourist visa to engage in prostitution, they may go </p><p>into debt to trafficking groups to pay for passport fees, </p><p>travel money, and clothes.  Officials tell us that women are </p><p>forced into submission by frequent beatings and threats; </p><p>often, trafficking gangs threaten violence to family members </p><p>in source countries should victims prove uncooperative or </p><p>testify against them.  Officials state women rarely complain </p><p>against their captors because of potential ramifications at </p><p>home.  TIP victims are closely chaperoned throughout the day </p><p>for meals and pre-arranged outings to shops or hairdressers. </p><p>On the other hand, large numbers of foreign women engaged in </p><p>illegal prostitution appear to enjoy a large amount of </p><p>freedom, registering for Turkish language classes, traveling, </p><p>and obtaining cell phones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. (U) Turkey is not a country of origin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. (SBU/NF) Combating TIP became a GOT priority in 2002.  An </p><p>inter-agency task force, chaired by the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Deputy Director General for Illegal Migration, is </p><p>comprised of officials from the Ministry of Interior </p><p>(Department of Foreigners, Borders and Asylum; Department of </p><p>Security; and Department of Organized Crime and Fraud), </p><p>Ministry of Justice (Department of International Relations, </p><p>Foreign Relations and Educational Affairs; Directorate of </p><p>Criminal Records), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and </p><p>Social Security (General Directorate of the Status and </p><p>Problems of Women; General Directorate of Child Protection </p><p>and Social Services), Ministry of Health (Department of </p><p>Treatment Services), Prime Ministry (Department of Human </p><p>Rights and Social Aid and Cooperation Fund). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. (SBU/NF) Post has not been able to obtain direct evidence </p><p>regarding the direct involvement of government or other law </p><p>enforcement officials in trafficking.  However, there are </p><p>credible reports of law enforcement officials receiving </p><p>kickbacks either to smuggle aliens or to turn a blind eye to </p><p>illegal foreign prostitution.  There are also indirect </p><p>reports of government officials turned traffickers because of </p><p>the potential earnings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. (SBU/NF) Although the GOT has ample law enforcement </p><p>resources to fight trafficking, it claims not to have </p><p>adequate funding for shelters or rehabilitation for </p><p>trafficking victims. However, the GOT is considering the </p><p>conversion of state-owned unused social training centers to </p><p>shelters and is negotiating with NGOs, most notably IOM, to </p><p>provide rehabilitation services to victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU/NF) PREVENTION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (SBU) While government officials acknowledge that </p><p>trafficking occurs, they argue that its scope is limited. </p><p>They state that Turkey has a problem of foreign prostitution </p><p>and illegal migration, contending Turkey\'s liberal visa </p><p>regime for Balkan, Black Sea Littoral, and Caucasian states </p><p>-- usually an automatic visa at the border for a nominal fee </p><p>-- obviates the need for human smuggling gangs.  However, in </p><p>response to international pressure, the GOT has begun </p><p>meaningful steps to combat TIP both in Turkey and in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) Government agencies involved in anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry </p><p>of the Interior (which oversees the police, Jandarma </p><p>(paramilitary rural police), and border guards); the Ministry </p><p>of Labor; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Health; </p><p>and the Directorate on the Status and Problems of Women </p><p>attached to the Ministry of Labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) There have not been any formal, Turkey-wide </p><p>anti-trafficking campaigns, to our knowledge.  Ad hoc, </p><p>individual governors and police officials are reported to </p><p>have engaged in public awareness campaigns against </p><p>trafficking at the local level utilizing local NGOs.  The </p><p>Directorate on the Problems and Status of Women held a panel </p><p>in December 2002 on the issue of TIP.  The 200 plus attendees </p><p>included NGO representatives, journalists, police chiefs, and </p><p>MFA officials.  The Ministry of Interior plans to give the </p><p>first training program to raise awareness of the TIP issue to </p><p>75 officers from 15 provinces by summer 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) The GOT does not support other programs to prevent </p><p>trafficking, to our knowledge.  However, the GOT is </p><p>finalizing a National Action Plan, under which it aims to: </p><p>- establish a national hotline for victims; </p><p>- establish shelters; </p><p>- centralize the issuance of work permits under one GOT body; </p><p>- provide legal assistance to foreigners in positions of </p><p>witnesses or victims during the continuations of court cases </p><p>opened under Article 201(b); </p><p>- provide more detailed training programs for officials on </p><p>how to take victim statements and how to determine who is a </p><p>victim; and, </p><p>- increase the number of NGOs working on combating </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (SBU) The GOT claims financial difficulties in funding </p><p>prevention programs.  However, GOT is pursuing alternate </p><p>funding opportunities, most notably NGO support, and </p><p>expanding current training programs to GOT officials to </p><p>include an anti-TIP component. </p><p>F. (SBU/NF) Neither Post nor IOM is aware of any Turkish or </p><p>foreign NGO actively engaged in fighting the trafficking of </p><p>women or aiding victims.  However, GOT recently contacted IOM </p><p>to prepare information on possible joint victim assistance </p><p>programs.  The British Council, the cultural office of the </p><p>British Embassy, organized a two-day conference on the issue </p><p>of trafficking in June 2002.  Regional scholars, police </p><p>officials, and NGOs participated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. (SBU/NF) Turkey borders Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, </p><p>Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Bulgaria, as well as EU member Greece. </p><p> Istanbul has a large international airport and there are </p><p>also international ports of entry by land, sea, and air </p><p>through several other cities, including Ankara, Trabzon, </p><p>Erzurum, Adana, and Sarp, on the Georgian border.  Although </p><p>the government expends considerable law enforcement resource </p><p>to monitor its borders, which are vast and remote, it is not </p><p>always successful, and the smuggling of goods and humans </p><p>occurs.  Contacts report, however, that the vast majority of </p><p>trafficking victims and other foreign women who engage in </p><p>prostitution enter Turkey legally, either by getting work </p><p>permits at Turkish Embassies abroad or, more commonly, by </p><p>obtaining one month visas at the border.  Since the collapse </p><p>of the Soviet Union, Turkey has adopted a liberal visa regime </p><p>with countries formerly in the Soviet Empire to encourage </p><p>trade and tourism.  Women who are deported for prostitution </p><p>come back repeatedly, according to police.  They alter their </p><p>names slightly or receive a passport in an entirely different </p><p>name with the help, according to Turkish police, of corrupt </p><p>officials in source countries or organized criminals.  Poor </p><p>centralization in Turkish border control or corruption may </p><p>also aid reentry.  Only the passports of women testing </p><p>positive for sexually transmitted diseases are scanned into a </p><p>centralized computer system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. (SBU/NF) The GOT started an inter-agency task force to </p><p>combat TIP led by the MFA Deputy Director General for Illegal </p><p>Migration.  (See number five; G for list of members of the </p><p>task force).  This task force is finalizing a "National </p><p>Action Plan" that will study all aspects of trafficking. </p><p>Also, the Ministry of Interior has established an internal </p><p>task force comprised of all relevant sections of the Ministry </p><p>to coordinate its efforts to fight TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) Turkey plays an active role in the international </p><p>community by regularly attending conferences hosted by SECI, </p><p>USDOS, and IOM.  GOT further works with the United Nations, </p><p>OSCE (Stability Pact and ODIHR), Interpol, and the European </p><p>Union to combat trafficking.  Turkey has been especially </p><p>active in the Trafficking Task Force within the framework of </p><p>the Stability Pact/ODIHR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. GOT has not yet provided copies of its National Action </p><p>Plan in response to repeated Embassy requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K. The MFA\'s Deputy Director General for Illegal Migration </p><p>spearheads the GOT\'s anti-trafficking initiatives as head of </p><p>the coordinating body for all agencies involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU/NF) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECTION OF TRAFFICKERS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) On August 3, 2002, the Turkish Parliament passed </p><p>anti-trafficking legislation, Article 201(b) of the Turkish </p><p>Penal Code. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The text of the law is as follows: "Those who provide, </p><p>kidnap, take or transfer from one place to another and house </p><p>other individuals with the intention of making them work or </p><p>serve by force, subject them to slavery or similar treatment, </p><p>threaten, pressure, use force or coercion to persuade them to </p><p>give up their bodily organs, use undue influence, secure </p><p>their consent by deception or by using the desperation of </p><p>such individuals shall be sentenced to five to ten years of </p><p>heavy imprisonment and a heavy fine of not less than one </p><p>billion liras. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If the actions that constitute a crime attempted with the </p><p>intentions laid out in the first paragraph exist, the victim </p><p>is assumed not to have given his/her consent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If the children below the age of eighteen are provided, </p><p>kidnapped, taken or transferred from one place to another or </p><p>housed with the intentions specified in paragraph one, even </p><p>when no intermediary actions relation to the crime are </p><p>committed, the penalties foreseen in paragraph one shall </p><p>still be applied to the perpetrator. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If the crimes listed in the paragraphs above are committed </p><p>in an organized manner, the penalties foreseen for the </p><p>perpetrators shall be doubled." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) The penalty for traffickers is five to ten years of </p><p>heavy imprisonment and a fine of not less than one billion </p><p>Turkish Liras.  These penalties may be doubled if the crimes </p><p>were committed in an organized manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) According to the Turkish Penal Code Article 416, the </p><p>penalty for rape and/or forced sexual assault is at least </p><p>seven years.  Attorney contacts note, however, that rape is </p><p>difficult to prove and suspects may receive lighter sentences </p><p>for various reasons involved in the incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) While final statistics regarding the implementation of </p><p>the anti-trafficking legislation are expected in June 2003, </p><p>GOT tells us that four pending cases have been brought </p><p>against traffickers since August 2002.  At the time of this </p><p>report, there were two public cases opened with trials </p><p>ongoing.  The first of these cases was opened at the Criminal </p><p>Court of Ordu on November 18, 2002, and the second was opened </p><p>at the second Criminal Court of Van on October 10, 2002.  Two </p><p>preliminary investigations have been also been performed. </p><p>The public prosecutor in Ozalp/Van investigated 7 individuals </p><p>and the prosecutor in Beykoz/Istanbul investigated five </p><p>individuals for their activities associated with trafficking; </p><p>the results are pending.  GOT did not provide further </p><p>details.  At the time of this report, reportedly thirty-four </p><p>persons have been apprehended across Turkey by local police </p><p>for their involvement in TIP and sent to the court under </p><p>Article 201(b).  Eight individuals were taken into custody in </p><p>Antalya, three in Kocaeli, two in Ankara, five in Manisa, two </p><p>in Nevsehir, two in Denizli, and ten in Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (SBU/NF) Generally, it is believed that organized crime </p><p>groups from states formerly in the Soviet Empire are behind </p><p>trafficking.  Contacts repeatedly stated that trafficking, </p><p>where it exists, is in the hands of small operators.  Groups </p><p>may be as small as four or five people who are connected, </p><p>most often, through kinship or friendship.  Increasingly, </p><p>former prostitutes who have gained Turkish citizenship are </p><p>working as procurers and pimps and bring women on tourist </p><p>visas.  Traffickers posing as tourist agencies or firms in </p><p>source countries bring women to Turkey with official work </p><p>permits.  Hotel owners are also believed to coerce women who </p><p>work as prostitutes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. (SBU/NF) Official sources tell us Turkey actively </p><p>investigates cases of trafficking using special investigation </p><p>techniques.  Police officials in Trabzon stated they used </p><p>primarily undercover operations against traffickers.  The </p><p>Ministry of Interior recently instructed governorships to </p><p>issue humanitarian visas and temporary residence permits for </p><p>victims to begin rehabilitation.  Our legal contacts hope </p><p>these visas and residence permits will allow victims to serve </p><p>as witnesses in investigations and trials of traffickers. </p><p>Mitigated punishment or immunity for cooperating suspects may </p><p>be granted unofficially; under Turkish law, there is no </p><p>policy for plea-bargaining or other confessional treatment </p><p>for victims of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) The GOT has begun implementing formal training </p><p>programs on trafficking for police and judicial officials. </p><p>The Ministry of Justice has given several training seminars </p><p>to approximately 600 judges and prosecutors on the issue of </p><p>combating trafficking-in-persons between the period of </p><p>October 2002 and February 2003.  The Ministry of Interior </p><p>recently developed a trafficking training program for 75 </p><p>police officials that will be completed by spring 2003.  As </p><p>these training programs were internally developed and </p><p>administered, Post is unaware of the content discussed or </p><p>length of these seminars.  The GOT also provides special </p><p>training to the TNP\'s Foreigner Section officials in areas </p><p>such as visa fraud, passport forgery, and illegal entries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. (SBU/NF) Turkey maintains security cooperation agreements, </p><p>which deal with trafficking, with Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, </p><p>Georgia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia.  As of </p><p>late January 2003, the MFA told Post GOT had not been </p><p>contacted by any countries regarding cases of trafficking. </p><p>Turkey cooperates with the OSCE, EU, Interpol, Europol, and </p><p>the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.  GOT officials have </p><p>attended numerous international conferences on the issue of </p><p>trafficking, organized by governmental and NGO bodies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) We have no information regarding the extradition of </p><p>persons charged with trafficking from other countries or </p><p>whether or not the government allows the extradition of its </p><p>own nationals, if any, charged with such offenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. (SBU/NF) We have no direct evidence of official </p><p>involvement in or tolerance of trafficking at an official </p><p>level.  Contacts state there is some tolerance of foreign </p><p>prostitution as long as it is kept within certain limits. </p><p>Authorities may turn a blind eye in the belief prostitution </p><p>brings an economic benefit.  Places where foreign women </p><p>congregate may provide a cover for trafficked women.  One </p><p>government source stated a current informant involved in </p><p>trafficking was a former police officer who turned to </p><p>trafficking crimes because of the money involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K. (SBU/NF) We do not have any direct evidence of GOT </p><p>involvement in trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L. (U) Turkey has adopted the following conventions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ILO Convention 182 (Ratified early 2001) </p><p>-- ILO Convention 29 and 105 on Forced or Compulsory Labor </p><p>(ILO Convention 29 went into effect on January 27, 1998 and </p><p>ILO Convention 105 on December 21, 1960) </p><p>-- Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the </p><p>Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child </p><p>Pornography (Ratified May 9, 2002) </p><p>-- The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking-in-Persons, especially Women and Children, </p><p>Supplementing the UN Convention Against Transnational </p><p>Organized Crime (Signed December 2000; Ratified January 31, </p><p>2003 and put into force February 4, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU/NF) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (SBU) The GOT intends to provide significant assistance to </p><p>victims in the future.  In the past, those who have been </p><p>trafficked into Turkey were generally detained and deported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Interior recently instructed all </p><p>governorships to issue humanitarian visas and temporary </p><p>residence permits for victims, to begin rehabilitation and </p><p>treatment for the victim as well as to allow officials to </p><p>begin investigation of traffickers and start legal action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT, under the umbrella of its Trafficking-in-Persons </p><p>task force, has plans to open TIP shelters in locations </p><p>believed to be vulnerable to trafficking.  The Ministry of </p><p>Interior ordered governors in 20 at risk cities to search the </p><p>possibility to create shelters.  These governors were </p><p>instructed to look at state-owned buildings that were not </p><p>currently in use.  The GOT has also contacted IOM in Turkey </p><p>to prepare a proposal for the operation of such shelters; </p><p>however, no agreement has been reached.  At the time of this </p><p>report, there were no shelters for trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If a foreign woman is detained for prostitution, she is </p><p>tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) before </p><p>deportation.  According to the police chief in Trabzon, if a </p><p>woman tests positive for a STD and requests assistance, she </p><p>would receive medical help.  In 2002, very few women who were </p><p>deported for prostitution from Trabzon and tested positive </p><p>for STDs, requested and received medical care.  According to </p><p>the Trabzon Police Chief, 740 foreign women were deported </p><p>from Trabzon in 2002.  All were subject to medical tests and </p><p>36 were infected with various diseases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. (SBU) Turkey does not fund victim services, and there are </p><p>no Turkish NGOs that provide such services.  Only IOM Turkey </p><p>has worked with source country embassies to provide travel </p><p>documents to women who have been detained for prostitution or </p><p>escaped from traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. (SBU) While Turkey plans to take more victim assistance </p><p>measures, victims of trafficking and foreign women detained </p><p>for prostitution have been generally deported within two </p><p>weeks of detention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (SBU) We have no evidence indicating that victims are </p><p>encouraged to file civil lawsuits or seek legal action </p><p>against traffickers.  The introduction of humanitarian visas </p><p>and temporary work permits (see para A) may show victims more </p><p>willing to seek legal action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (SBU) To our knowledge, the government does not provide </p><p>protection for victims and witnesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. (SBU) The GOT has provided trafficking-in-persons training </p><p>to judicial and police officials (see question 7 para G); </p><p>however, course content has not been shared with post.  The </p><p>second part of the question does not apply because Turkey is </p><p>not a source country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) Not applicable.  Turkey is not a source country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. (U) There are no Turkish NGOs working with trafficking </p><p>victims.  To our knowledge, IOM Turkey is the only NGO that </p><p>has provided assistance to trafficking victims (see para B). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
