D302748 </p><p> </p><p>1.   ON 17 DEC COMMERCIAL OFFICER MARY O\'BRIEN MET WITH EMAD </p><p>BITAR OF CSI MIDDLE EAST AND COR CORBEEK OF EMERSON EUROPE </p><p>REGARDING PRELICENSE CHECK RQUESTED IN REFTEL. </p><p>2.   EMERSON PROCESS MANAGEMENT, FORMERLY EMERSON ELECTRIC, </p><p>HAS RECENTLY PURCHASED COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, INC, (CSI) OF </p><p>KNOXVILLE, TN. (WWW.CSIMEANSRELIABILITY.COM) CSI IS KNOWN TO </p><p>COMMOFF AS A DISTRIBUTOR OF THERMAL IMAGING EQUIPMENT, </p><p>INCLUDING FLIR, IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. </p><p>3.   EARLIER IN THE DAY, COMMOFF O\'BRIEN MET WITH MR. BITAR </p><p>AT MEOS REGARDING ANOTHER PRELICENSE CHECK (D302543) THAT </p><p>ALSO INVOLVED CSI. DURING THAT MEETING, MR. BITAR OF CSI </p><p>SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANOTHER ORDER AND PERHAPS HIS BOSS </p><p>HAD ORDERED IT WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE </p><p>MADE TO MEET AT THE PREMISES OF EMERSON/CSI LATER THAT DAY. </p><p>4.    EMERSON AND CSI MIDDLE EAST SHARE OFFICE SPACE IN THE </p><p>JEBEL ALI FREE ZONE.  COMOFF MET WITH BITAR AND HIS MANAGER, </p><p>COR CORBEEK.  CORBEEK EXPLAINED THE CAMERA WOULD BE USED IN </p><p>TRAINING CLASSES AT EMERSON\'S FACILITY FOR PEOPLE FROM </p><p>AROUND THE GULF REGION, NORTH AFRICA, AND SOUTH ASIA. COMOFF </p><p>VISITED A CLASS IN SESSION THAT INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>FROM MOROCCO, UAE, AND KUWAIT, AS WELL AS A LARGE WELL </p><p>EQUIPPED STOREROOM WHERE CSI/EMERSON KEEP A VARIETY OF </p><p>INSTRUMENTS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES. </p><p>5.   WHEN ASKED WHO PLACED THE ORDER ON CSI EUROPE, CORBEEK </p><p>SAID IT WAS BITAR, WHO HAD EARLIER SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF </p><p>THE TRANSACTION.  WHEN ASKED FOR A COPY THE PURCHASE ORDER </p><p>CSI MIDDLE EAST HAD SENT TO CSI EUROPE, BITAR SAID HE WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT AND FAX IT TO THE FCS OFFICE.  THE </p><p>PURCHASE ORDER IS DATED 12/19 TWO DAYS AFTER THE VISIT AND </p><p>WAS FAXED TO THE FCS OFFICE ON 12/22.  IT ALSO APPEARS THE </p><p>PURCHASE ORDER WAS PLACED ON CSI IN THE U.S. RATHER THAN </p><p>ELECTROPHYSICS BECAUSE IT SAYS EX WORKS KNOXVILLE WHICH IS </p><p>WHERE CSI IS HEADQUARTERED. </p><p>6.   ON 12/23, COMMOFF RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR. BITAR </p><p>WHEREIN HE FIRST SAYS THE ORDER WAS FOR AN UNNAMED CUSTOMER </p><p>IN RAS AL KHAIMAH. COMOFF HAS ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT CSI TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE CUSTOMER IN RAS AL KHAIMAH BUT </p><p>IT APPEARS THE CSI IS CLOSED DURING THIS HOLIDAY WEEK. THE </p><p>LETTER THEN GOES ON TO SAY THE UNIT WILL BE KEPT IN BELGIUM </p><p>AND USED IN TRAINING IN A VARIETY OF PLACES INCLUDING THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST.  NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THIS DURING THE MEETING </p><p>AT CSI/EMERSON.  THE LETTER AND PURCHASE ORDER DOCUMENTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN IMAGED AND CAN BE EMAILED FOR EA AND INTERAGENCY </p><p>REVIEW. </p><p>7.   CONTACTS MADE BY OEE HQ (MICHELLE ZAGER) TO THE </p><p>APPLICANT, ELECTROPHYSICS, INDICATE THEY HAVE NO </p><p>DOCUMENTATION OF THIS ORDER, STATING THEY ARE ACTING AS A </p><p>MIDDLEMAN BETWEEN RAYTHEON AND CSI.  ELECTROPHYSICS SAYS CSI </p><p>BELGIUM WILL BE THE OWNER OF THE CAMERA AND WILL SEND IT TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTORS AS NEEDED AND THEN HAVE THE DISTRIBUTORS RETURN </p><p>THE CAMERA TO BELGIUM WHEN NOT IN USE. </p><p>8.   NOTE THAT THE SALE OF A CAMERA TO MEOS WAS SUPPORTED BY </p><p>A BXA-711 BUT THAT NO BXA-711 APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED </p><p>BY CSI MIDDLE EAST IN THIS CASE.  PERHAPS ELECTROPHYSICS </p><p>CONSIDERS THIS AN EXPORT FOR DEMONSTRATION; HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR WHETHER DEMONSTRATION INCLUDES TRAINING IN THE USE </p><p>AND OPERATION OF THE CAMERA AND ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE. </p><p>9.   CSI MIDDLE EAST IS THE SOLE PRESENCE OF CSI IN THIS </p><p>PART OF THE WORLD.  THEY ARE A LEGITIMATE COMPANY WITH A </p><p>LEGITIMATE NEED FOR THIS PRODUCT, ALTHOUGH THEY WERE </p><p>SOMEWHAT EVASIVE IN THEIR ANSWERS. </p><p>10.  THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS CHECK THOUGH REVEALS THAT THE </p><p>OWNER, CONSIGNEE AND PARTY FIRST RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH ANY LICENSE CONDITIONS WOULD BE CSI EUROPE.  COMOFF </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT CSI EUROPE AS WELL AS CSI MIDDLE EAST BE </p><p>REQUIRED TO AGREE IN ADVANCE TO ANY LICENSE CONDITIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING A SECURITY PLAN AND PROHIBITIONS ON TRAINING </p><p>PERSONNEL FOR EMBARGOED DESTINATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA# </p><p></p></div>
