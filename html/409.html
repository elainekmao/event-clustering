<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 MADRID 12668 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SP, PGOV, KPRP </p><p>SUBJECT: SPAIN: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR </p><p>SPAIN FOR 1990.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>A. PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE TWO MAJOR TERRORIST GROUPS IN SPAIN ARE THE EXTREMIST </p><p>BASQUE SEPARATIST GROUP EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA (ETA), OR BASQUE </p><p>HOMELAND AND LIBERTY, AND THE SMALLER, BUT VIRULENT, FIRST OF </p><p>OCTOBER ANTI-FASCIST RESISTANCE GROUPS (GRAPO).  ETA HAS </p><p>LIMITED INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS, PRIMARILY WITH BASQUES </p><p>RESIDENT IN FRANCE, BUT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN 1990 FOR </p><p>SEVERAL TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST SPANISH INSTALLATIONS IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS.  GRAPO, ALSO BASICALLY A DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUP, </p><p>HAS AT LEAST THE PUBLIC SYMPATHY OF THE GERMAN RED ARMY </p><p>FACTION.  TWO SMALLER TERRORIST GROUPS WERE ACTIVE IN 1990: </p><p>TERRA LLIURE, A CATALAN SEPARATIST GROUP, AND THE GUERRILLA </p><p>ARMY OF THE FREE GALICIAN PEOPLE (EGPGC), A GALICIAN </p><p>NATIONALIST GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN EARLY 1990, A HITHERTO UNKNOWN </p><p>ETA TERRORIST NETWORK DIRECTED FROM FRANCE, KNOWN AS THE </p><p>"ITINERANT COMMAND," WAS UNCOVERED AND SEVERAL KEY LEADERS </p><p>ARRESTED.  OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD, THIS GROUP HAD BEEN </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME 40 TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATIONS </p><p>IN SPAIN.  THE DISCOVERY OF THE NETWORK BEGAN WITH THE ARREST </p><p>OF A FRENCH BASQUE, HENRI PAROT, IN SEVILLE IN APRIL PRIOR TO A </p><p>PLANNED ETA ATTACK ON THE LOCAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE.  AS A RESULT OF CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES IN FRANCE AND SPAIN, OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ITINERANT </p><p>COMMAND WERE LATER ARRESTED IN FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NO MAJOR PROSECUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISTS WERE CONCLUDED DURING 1990.  HOWEVER, THE CRIMINAL </p><p>JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND PRE-TRIAL </p><p>PROCEDURES AGAINST MANY INCARCERATED TERRORISTS.  AS OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1990, 468 MEMBERS OF ETA WERE IN PRISON IN SPAIN, </p><p>MANY OF THEM AWAITING TRIAL.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN </p><p>ACTION AGAINST RIGHT-WING TERRORISTS.  SEVERAL PERSONS, </p><p>INCLUDING A NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER, ARE IN PREVENTIVE </p><p>DETENTION PENDING PROSECUTION FOR THE MADRID ASSASSINATION OF A </p><p>PRO-ETA BASQUE CONGRESSMAN IN LATE 1989; AND TWO OTHER NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE OFFICERS ARE AWAITING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF ORGANIZING AN </p><p>EXTREME RIGHT DEATH SQUAD OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST GROUPS FOR </p><p>LIBERATION (GAL) THAT OPERATED IN SOUTHERN FRANCE FROM 1983 TO </p><p>1986.  AUTHORITIES OBTAINED COURT ORDERS IN JULY TO EXTEND </p><p>THEIR PREVENTIVE DETENTION FOR TWO YEARS.  SPAIN IS ALSO </p><p>PURSUING THE PROSECUTION OF THREE HIZBALLAH TERRORISTS ARRESTED </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 1989 IN MADRID AND VALENCIA, DESPITE REPORTED </p><p>WARNINGS BY HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS IN LEBANON OF POSSIBLE </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST SPANISH TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DELAYS IN PROSECUTION ARE NOT UNUSUAL FOR CRIMINAL CASES IN </p><p>SPAIN.  THE LAW PERMITS PREVENTIVE DETENTION FOR UP TO TWO </p><p>YEARS PENDING TRIAL; HOWEVER, EVEN THIS LIMIT ON PREVENTIVE </p><p>DETENTION MAY BE EXTENDED IN CASES INVOLVING SERIOUS CRIMES, </p><p>SUCH AS TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN 1990, SPANISH COURTS CONTINUED TO DEAL STERNLY WITH </p><p>TERRORIST CASES, SUBJECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS.  THE </p><p>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ROUTINELY SEEK STIFF PRISON SENTENCES FOR </p><p>ACCUSED TERRORISTS.  IN TWO RECENT CASES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SOUGHT SENTENCES OF 240 YEARS FOR TWO ETA TERRORISTS </p><p>FOR AN ALLEGED 1987 ATTACK AGAINST A POLICE CONVOY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION LIMITS THE ACTUAL TIME SERVED TO A </p><p>MAXIMUM OF 30 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p>B. EXTRADITIONS </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>7.  ETA TERRORISTS RESIDE IN MANY FOREIGN NATIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>CAPE VERDE, CUBA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, FRANCE, SAO </p><p>TOME E PRINCIPE, AND VENEZUELA.  OFTEN, THEY RESIDE ABROAD IN </p><p>AN EXILE STATUS UNDER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SPAIN AND THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  DURING 1990, SPAIN VIGOROUSLY PURSUED EFFORTS TO EXTRADITE </p><p>ETA TERRORISTS FROM ABROAD, ESPECIALLY FROM FRANCE.  IN MAY, </p><p>FRANCE EXTRADITED JOSE RAMON MARTINEZ DE LA FUENTE ("TZORI") TO </p><p>SPAIN; MARTINEZ HAD BEEN DETAINED IN FRANCE IN 1985.  WITH THIS </p><p>EXCEPTION, NO IMPORTANT ETA MEMBER RESIDENT IN FRANCE HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTRADITED TO SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN OCTOBER 1990, FRANCE TURNED DOWN THREE MAJOR SPANISH </p><p>EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR ETA TERRORISTS.  ONE INVOLVED JOSE </p><p>ANTONIO URRUTICOETXEA BENGOETXEA ("JOSU TERNERA"), WHO WAS </p><p>CONSIDERED A MAJOR ETA LEADER AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST IN </p><p>1988.  FRANCE DENIED THE EXTRADITION ON THE GROUNDS THAT </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN AN ARMED BAND WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY </p><p>EXTRADITION.  ANOTHER EXTRADITION REQUEST, THE SEVENTH ONE </p><p>AGAINST SANTIAGO ARROSPIDE-SARASOLA ("SANTI POTROS"), WAS </p><p>DENIED IN OCTOBER ON THE SAME GROUNDS, EVEN AS SPAIN FILED AN </p><p>EIGHTH EXTRADITION REQUEST.  THIS MAN HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A </p><p>POLITICAL REFUGEE BY FRANCE SINCE 1982.  IN A THIRD DECISION, </p><p>THIS ONE INVOLVING JOSE LUIZ ARRIETA ZUBIMENDI ("AIZCOITI"), </p><p>THE FRENCH COURT TERMED THE SPANISH EXTRADITION "WEAK" FOR </p><p>FAILURE TO ALLEGE AND DOCUMENT SPECIFIC CRIMINAL CHARGES WITHIN </p><p>THE REQUIRED TIME PERIOD, BUT LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>SPAIN\'S STRENGTHENING THE REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN FALL 1990, SPAIN REQUESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SAO </p><p>TOME E PRINCIPE WITHDRAW DIPLOMATIC STATUS FROM SPANISH </p><p>NATIONAL FRANCISCO PAESA SANCHEZ, WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING </p><p>INVOLVED WITH THE GAL, IN ORDER THAT PAESA MIGHT BE EXTRADITED </p><p>TO SPAIN.  PAESA SERVES AS REPRESENTATIVE OF SAO TOME E </p><p>PRINCIPE TO U.N. AGENCIES IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>11.  A MADRID COURT REPORTEDLY APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER 1989 A GOF </p><p>REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF GEORGE MENDAILLE, ACCUSED OF </p><p>RECRUITING GUNMEN INVOLVED IN GAL OPERATIONS IN FRANCE. </p><p>SPANISH AUTHORITIES RELEASED MENDAILLE FROM PREVENTIVE </p><p>DETENTION THIS SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE PRINCIPAL IMPEDIMENT TO EXTRADITION FROM SPAIN IS THAT </p><p>EXTRADITION WILL NOT BE GRANTED IF THE PERSON WOULD BE SUBJECT </p><p>TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AVOIDED IN THE </p><p>PAST BY AN UNDERTAKING BY THE REQUESTING COUNTRY THAT THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY WILL NOT BE SOUGHT IN THE CASE IN QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>D. RESPONSES TO COMBAT TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT STRONGLY AND CONSISTENTLY OPPOSES </p><p>TERRORISM.  TERRORIST ACTS ARE VEHEMENTLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY </p><p>CONDEMNED BY HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ANY </p><p>DOMESTIC INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN IS WAGING A STRONG CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST DOMESTIC SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN EARLY </p><p>1990, THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED AN INTENSE DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN </p><p>FOR CITIZEN ASSISTANCE IN APPREHENDING THE SIX GRAPO MEMBERS </p><p>PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASED GRAPO TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY IN LATE 1989 AND EARLY 1990. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN HAS DISPERSED ETA PRISONERS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SPANISH PRISON SYSTEM, IN AN EFFORT TO ISOLATE </p><p>SUCH PRISONERS FROM EACH OTHER AND TO DENY THEM MUTUAL </p><p>SUPPORT.  FOLLOWING AN UPSURGE IN GRAPO ATTACKS IN LATE 1989 </p><p>AND EARLY 1990, GRAPO PRISONERS WERE ALSO DISPERSED.   WHEN </p><p>GRAPO PRISONERS PROTESTED THIS DISPERSION BY A PROLONGED HUNGER </p><p>STRIKE, SOME WERE FORCE-FED TO PREVENT DEATH, AN ACTION LATER </p><p>UPHELD BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS JUSTIFIED.  SECURITY </p><p>FORCES WERE PLACED ON HIGH ALERT AFTER ONE OF THE GRAPO HUNGER </p><p>STRIKERS DIED, AND THEY HAVE REMAINED ON HIGH ALERT EVER SINCE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED A LIMITED IMMUNITY </p><p>PROGRAM FOR TERRORIST PRISONERS WHO WILL RENOUNCE THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE.  THIS "REINSERTION PROGRAM" IS DESIGNED NOT ONLY TO </p><p>CONVINCE INDIVIDUAL TERRORISTS TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM AS A </p><p>POLITICAL TOOL, BUT TO DIVIDE LOYALTIES WITHIN THE TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS.  CURRENTLY, 17 OF THE MORE THAN 450 ETA PRISONERS HAVE </p><p>TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS OFFER AND ARE BEING HELD UNDER LOW </p><p>SECURITY CONDITIONS; IN 1989, ONLY 2 PRISONERS WERE HELD UNDER </p><p>SUCH LOW SECURITY CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  SPAIN HAS ALSO SOUGHT TO IMPEDE FUND RAISING ACTIVITIES BY </p><p>TERRORISTS, BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT RANSOMS FROM </p><p>THE FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES OF KIDNAP VICTIMS.  SPANISH LAW </p><p>MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO "COLLABORATE" WITH TERRORISTS BY PAYING A </p><p>RANSOM.  SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ACTED AS MIDDLEMEN IN THE PAYMENT </p><p>OF RANSOM DEMANDS BY ETA WERE CHARGED WITH THIS OFFENSE IN </p><p>MARCH 1990.  THEY WERE ALSO UNDER SUSPICION AS PRINCIPALS IN A </p><p>SERIES OF KIDNAPPINGS BY ETA. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OF 1990 </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE MAJOR FOCUS OF SPAIN\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIVITIES HAS </p><p>BEEN ETA AND GRAPO.  NONETHELESS, THE ARREST IN NOVEMBER 1989 </p><p>OF THE EIGHT HIZBALLAH TERRORISTS, TOGETHER WITH EXPLOSIVES, IN </p><p>SPAIN BROUGHT AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE DANGER SUCH </p><p>TRANSNATIONAL GROUPS MAY POSE WITHIN SPAIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>FOLLOWING THIS ARREST, SPAIN SPONSORED AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS THE HIZBALLAH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p>SPAIN ALSO COORDINATES ITS COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS THROUGH ITS </p><p>ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN THE EC\'S TREVI GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN 1990, BILATERAL ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION IMPROVED </p><p>MOST NOTABLY WITH FRANCE.  THE MOST TANGIBLE RESULT WAS THE </p><p>ARREST IN FRANCE AND SPAIN OF THREE OF THE FIVE LEADERS OF </p><p>ETA\'S ITINERANT COMMAND.  SPAIN ALSO CONSULTS REGULARLY ON A </p><p>BILATERAL BASIS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>20.  DOMESTICALLY, SPAIN HAS TRIED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF </p><p>ITS POLICE OPERATIONS.  COOPERATION BETWEEN REGIONAL AND </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE FORCES HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TARGETED AND THE </p><p>BASQUE REGIONAL POLICE PARTICIPATED IN SOME NATIONAL POLICE </p><p>OPERATIONS IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>21.  WHEN A HIGHER THREAT OF TERRORISM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, </p><p>SPANISH AUTHORITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL TERRORIST OPERATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS WAS IMPROVED IN MID-1990 FOLLOWING A RASH </p><p>OF SUCCESSFUL LETTER AND PACKAGE BOMBS.  POLICE SECURITY IS </p><p>MARKEDLY INCREASED FOR TOURIST SITES DURING THE SUMMER TOURIST </p><p>SEASON; AND WHEN ETA THREATENED TO BOMB SPECIFIED RAILWAY LINES </p><p>IN AUGUST, AS IT HAD DONE IN THE PAST, PASSENGER TRAFFIC WAS </p><p>DIVERTED TO OTHER LINES WHENEVER POSSIBLE, IN ADDITION TO OTHER </p><p>PRECAUTIONS.   MORE RECENTLY, SECURITY AROUND U.S. AND SEVERAL </p><p>OTHER FOREIGN INSTALLATIONS WAS INCREASED BECAUSE OF A HIGHER </p><p>THREAT LEVEL OF MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORISM ARISING FROM EVENTS IN </p><p>THE GULF. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>F.  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, FINANCIALLY OR DIPLOMATICALLY, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID, BUT THAT OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  IN THE UNITED NATIONS, THE GOS HAS OPPOSED </p><p>OBSERVER STATUS FOR THE PLO, AND THE GOS SUPPORTS EC SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>23.  THE GOS DOES NOT MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON TERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>H. CHANGES IN SPANISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>24.  DOMESTIC COUNTERTERRORISM, AIMED PRIMARILY AT ETA AND </p><p>GRAPO, IS AN HIGH, PRIORITY EFFORT.  OTHER TERRORIST THREATS </p><p>HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN VIEWED AS IMMEDIATE.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>ARREST OF HIZBALLAH MEMBERS AND SEIZURE OF EXPLOSIVES IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1989 RAISED THE THREAT OF MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM IN </p><p>SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>25.  WITH THE ADVENT OF THE 1992 OLYMPIC GAMES IN BARCELONA AND </p><p>THE WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE, SPAIN IS INCREASINGLY AWARE AND </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THOSE EVENTS.  IN THIS REGARD, ETA THREATENED IN 1990 TO </p><p>DISRUPT THE WORLD\'S FAIR AND SENT A PACKAGE BOMB TO THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZAPPALA </p><p></p></div>
