Although the </p><p>Tigers are far from creating any sort of embryonic state </p><p>structure (despite simplistic press reporting to the </p><p>contrary), they are steadily expanding their influence </p><p>in the north and east even as the peace process moves </p><p>forward.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Formalizing Control in the Wanni </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In the past several months, the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have continued to formalize </p><p>their control of the Wanni region, and flex their </p><p>muscles in Jaffna and the east.  In the Wanni, the Tiger </p><p>focus has been on putting in place quasi-government </p><p>agencies, as it tries to "civilianize" its control of </p><p>the region.  (Note:  Per Ref J, the Tigers have long had </p><p>military control of most of the Wanni region, a lightly </p><p>populated area located in northern Sri Lanka.  It was </p><p>only with the advent of the peace process -- and the </p><p>ceasefire -- that the group was able to take firm steps </p><p>in the administrative sphere.)  Recent Tiger efforts to </p><p>create a civilian administrative structure have </p><p>included: </p><p> </p><p>-- Law Enforcement:  According to many reports, the </p><p>Tigers have put in place "Tamil Eelam police" offices </p><p>throughout the Wanni (also see Ref J).  A judicial </p><p>system is also in place complete with "judges" and </p><p>"courts."  There are also reports that there is a law </p><p>school. </p><p> </p><p>-- Communications:  After years of underground activity, </p><p>the "Voice of the Tigers" radio station has recently </p><p>been legalized, per Sri Lankan government regulations. </p><p>The radio station has also been upgraded in its </p><p>capabilities, and now can be heard clearly throughout </p><p>the Wanni and nearby regions.  (Note:  At the request of </p><p>the GSL, the equipment for the upgrade was imported into </p><p>Sri Lanka by the Norwegian Embassy.  Anti-peace process </p><p>groups have harshly criticized the Norwegians for their </p><p>involvement.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Education:  The LTTE is also working hard to expand </p><p>its educational system.  It has, for example, opened a </p><p>network of schools in the Wanni in past months. </p><p>Although the GSL provides textbooks for all students in </p><p>the country, the LTTE denies students in the areas it </p><p>controls access to certain school texts because the </p><p>content varies from the LTTE\'s views.  In place of the </p><p>GSL\'s texts, the LTTE has provided its own curriculum. </p><p>General Secretary of the "All-Island Tamil Teachers </p><p>Union" T. Mahasivam has told us that children in the </p><p>Wanni do not have access to proper educational material </p><p>due in large part to the LTTE\'s strict limitations. </p><p>(Note:  On the subject of education, the Tamil press has </p><p>recently reported that the Tigers have even begun an "e- </p><p>learning center" in the Wanni.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Banking/Customs:  As detailed in Ref C, in an attempt </p><p>to increase its revenues, the LTTE is expanding its </p><p>financial institutions in the Wanni by opening "Tamil </p><p>Eelam Bank" branches and creating an "Eelam Customs" </p><p>agency.  Although some media accounts claim the bank has </p><p>existed in some form for approximately 10 years, it now </p><p>has five branch offices and is reportedly catering to </p><p>returning Internally Displaced Persons (IDP\'s).  The </p><p>bank reportedly offers almost all of the standard </p><p>financial services.  The LTTE also collects a </p><p>predetermined "customs fee" on all items transported </p><p>through the Wanni.  The LTTE has published the rate of </p><p>its customs fees in Tamil-language newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  While the LTTE\'s activities are most noticeable </p><p>in the Wanni region, the group is also reportedly taking </p><p>similar actions in those sections of the east under its </p><p>control.  It is not clear, but perhaps something around </p><p>a third or more of the land area of the Eastern Province </p><p>is under LTTE control.  Overall, including the Wanni and </p><p>the east, approximately 15 percent of the land area of </p><p>Sri Lanka is believed to be under direct Tiger control, </p><p>an area containing a population of about 500,000 </p><p>people.) </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Wanni Steps seen as Rudimentary </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite the Tigers\' best efforts, the general </p><p>feeling among most observers is that their attempts to </p><p>create a civilian administrative structure have not been </p><p>fully successful, thus far.  Making this point, Jehan </p><p>Perera of the National Peace Council, a well-known local </p><p>NGO, told us that he thought the Tiger effort was </p><p>rudimentary and seriously retarded by lack of funds. </p><p>Many of the so-called "Tamil Eelam" offices were "paper" </p><p>creations, with little substance, other than the Tiger </p><p>"wish" that the outside world perceive their moves as </p><p>something important.  He added that he still did not </p><p>consider the Tigers a "civilian political organization," </p><p>but rather a military/insurgent grouping that remained </p><p>ready for war, if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>========================================== </p><p>Mafia-type Behavior in Jaffna and the East </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In the meantime, Tiger cadre are increasingly </p><p>employing strong-arm, mafia-type tactics in government- </p><p>controlled areas of Jaffna and the east.  The Tigers\' </p><p>objective in employing such tactics seems to be to </p><p>marginalize the GSL\'s governing apparatus (including the </p><p>military), and other Tamil groups, so as to allow the </p><p>LTTE to emerge as the preeminent force in Jaffna and the </p><p>east, as it is in the Wanni.  Mafia-type Tiger </p><p>activities in Jaffna and the east include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Extorting Money:  There are continuing reports that </p><p>the Tigers are engaged in widespread extortion in Jaffna </p><p>and the east.  The victims of the extortion effort are </p><p>primarily Tamil businessmen working in those areas. </p><p>Mission has heard reports that if Tamils do not comply </p><p>by saying they do not have the money the Tigers find </p><p>ways to access bank accounts and threaten them. </p><p>(Note:  Although they were targets last year, Muslims </p><p>living in the east no longer seem to be a major class of </p><p>victims.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Seizing Properties:  Mission has heard many reports </p><p>that the LTTE has seized numerous properties in Jaffna </p><p>and the east.  During a visit to Batticaloa town in </p><p>November, for example, Mission heard that numerous homes </p><p>had been taken over by the LTTE as offices for its cadre </p><p>(see Ref H).  (Note:  The LTTE has opened up dozens of </p><p>political and other party offices in the north and the </p><p>east in recent months, as allowed by the ceasefire </p><p>accord.)  In comments confirmed by Tamil contacts, Sri </p><p>Lankan military officials have also recently told us </p><p>that the same practice is increasingly widespread in </p><p>Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>-- Intimidating other Tamil groups:  Mission continues </p><p>to hear credible reports that the LTTE is intimidating </p><p>Tamil groups and individuals that disagree with Tiger </p><p>views (Ref E).  The Eelam People\'s Democratic Party </p><p>(EPDP) has been a regular target of the LTTE, for </p><p>example.  According to reliable reports, LTTE cadres </p><p>have attacked at least four EPDP offices in the Jaffna </p><p>region in recent months.  In addition to the EPDP, </p><p>another group called the Eelam People\'s Revolutionary </p><p>Liberation Front (EPRLF) also accuses the LTTE of </p><p>preventing EPRLF cadre from performing political work in </p><p>Jaffna and the east. </p><p> </p><p>-- Recruitment Drives:  As reported in Ref D, the LTTE </p><p>has actively recruited children in recent months despite </p><p>past pledges to stop such efforts.  Through dragoon-like </p><p>efforts, the LTTE is also actively recruiting young men </p><p>and women.  The reports tend to indicate that these </p><p>recruitment efforts have been successful and that the </p><p>number of LTTE cadre continues to spike up, although the </p><p>exact number of recruits is not clear.  All the recruits </p><p>are Tamil, with most recruitment taking place in the </p><p>east. </p><p> </p><p>============================================ </p><p>Despite Efforts, Strong Nexus of GSL Control </p><p>============================================ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Again, despite the LTTE\'s best efforts, the </p><p>government and its security forces still maintain a </p><p>strong nexus of control in Jaffna and the east.  The </p><p>GSL, for example has effectively deflected the LTTE\'s </p><p>demand that it reduce its "high security zones" in </p><p>Jaffna, which account for about 18 percent of the land </p><p>area there.  Operating from these positions of strength, </p><p>the Sri Lankan military continues to maintain over </p><p>30,000 troops in the Jaffna Peninsula.  In addition, the </p><p>government\'s position in the east is still formidable, </p><p>with around 20,000 troops and several thousand highly- </p><p>trained Special Task Force police deployed throughout </p><p>the region.  Moreover, although the government\'s </p><p>civilian government apparatus is believed to have been </p><p>heavily penetrated by LTTE informers, there is no doubt </p><p>that the GSL is still in administrative control of </p><p>Jaffna and the east. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Recent press reporting in the "New York Times" </p><p>and the "Washington Post" painted a dire picture in </p><p>which the Tigers had already created a de facto "Tamil </p><p>Eelam" in the north and east.  If one was only to look </p><p>at the "Tamil Eelam" signboards in the Wanni or other </p><p>parts of the north and east without digging much deeper, </p><p>that may seem to be the case.  In actuality, the </p><p>situation is much more complicated, with the Tigers far </p><p>from creating any sort of embryonic state structure. </p><p>First, as noted, their efforts in the Wanni are </p><p>tentative and hindered by resources.  In addition, the </p><p>Wanni is an exposed region, surrounded by government </p><p>forces, factors that tend to hinder complete LTTE </p><p>freedom of maneuver.  Second, while of serious human </p><p>rights concern, the LTTE\'s mafia-like activities in </p><p>Jaffna and the east have only served to diminish </p><p>governmental control, not marginalize it entirely. </p><p>Taking all of these caveats into account, however, it is </p><p>safe to say that the LTTE is steadily expanding its </p><p>sphere of influence in the north and east even as the </p><p>peace process moves forward.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
