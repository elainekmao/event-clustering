<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001053 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS TAKE PART IN SIZABLE BUT SOGGY ANTI-WAR </p><p>MARCH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On Saturday, February 15, thousands of </p><p>demonstrators </p><p>participated in a 2 kilometer anti-war march through the </p><p>Shmeisani </p><p>district of Amman ending at the UN Headquarters there.  The </p><p>demonstration, organized by the Higher Coordination Committee </p><p>for </p><p>Opposition Parties, was approved by the government and </p><p>proceeded </p><p>amidst a large and visible police presence.  Press estimates </p><p>of </p><p>crowd size ranged from 5,000 to 15,000 (with embassy security </p><p>contacts </p><p>reporting the actual size at between 3,000 to 5,000).  The </p><p>crowd would presumably have been larger but for the cold and </p><p>heavy </p><p>rains which fell during the march.  There were no arrests and </p><p>the demonstration </p><p>ended peacefully. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The demonstrators chanted anti-war and anti-U.S. </p><p>statements and carried banners such as "No blood for oil", </p><p>"No to attacking Iraq" and "USA, where is your democracy". </p><p>Many participants hoisted pictures of King Abdullah and </p><p>Saddam Hussein along with </p><p>Jordanian, Palestinian, Iraqi and Muslim Brotherhood flags. </p><p>Islamic Action Front Secretary General Hamzeh </p><p>Mansour addressed the crowd, indulging in explicitly </p><p>anti-American </p><p>rhetoric stating that Arab and world public opinion </p><p>against a military strike was reaching the boiling point. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT.  The march and rally were fully arranged in </p><p>advance between the GOJ and the rally sponsors.  The rhetoric </p><p>was sometimes heated and called on Arab leaders to refrain </p><p>from </p><p>assisting US or British forces in any military offensive. The </p><p>tone of </p><p>the rally and of local press reports and editorials boasted </p><p>of a perceived </p><p>tide of opposition to the war around the globe. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Nevertheless, there is a seeming disconnect between </p><p>the almost-universal opposition </p><p>among Jordanians to war in Iraq and the modest size of the </p><p>demonstration here.  Jordanian </p><p>contacts lament the fact that demonstrations in European </p><p>countries were larger, and </p><p>that many were led by government officials reflecting the </p><p>opposition of their people.  Some </p><p>contacts attribute the low turnout to wariness among </p><p>Jordanians about getting involved in an anti-war </p><p>movement clearly not popular with the government; others to </p><p>weariness from years of unnerving news from </p><p>the West Bank and Iraq and to a pervasive sense that </p><p>Jordanians have no power to influence the march to war. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
