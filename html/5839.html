<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/A - RUSCH AND NORONHA, NEA/ARN AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: INS-APPROVED IRAQI REFUGEES AWAITING SAO CLEARANCE </p><p>FACE INCREASING PRESSURES AND DIFFICULTIES IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) AS REQUESTED BY PRM/A, THIS IS A BRIEF UPDATE </p><p>ABOUT THE INCREASING PRESSURES AND DIFFICULTIES REPORTED IN </p><p>THREE INS APPROVED REFUGEE CASES (13 PERSONS), PENDING THEIR </p><p>SAO CLEARANCE.  WE NOTE THAT, WHILE THE APPLICANTS THEMSELVES </p><p>ARE THE PRIME SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN TWO CASES, UNHCR AMMAN </p><p>HAS CONFIRMED THE SITUATION OF THE THIRD, AND EXPRESSES </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF IRAQI REFUGEES MORE </p><p>BROADLY AS REGIONAL TENSIONS RISE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ONE OF THE CASES, JO-000626, WAS APPROVED IN THE JULY </p><p>2001 INS MISSION AND WAS READY FOR TRAVEL IN SEPTEMBER 2001. </p><p>NEW PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTED AFTER 9-11 REQUIRED US TO RESUBMIT </p><p>HIS SAO REQUEST AND JO-000626 HAS BEEN PENDING EVER SINCE. </p><p>DUE TO HIS LONG STAY IN JORDAN, JO-000626 CLAIMS THAT HE IS </p><p>KNOWN TO THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  AS A RESULT, HE </p><p>HAS TO KEEP A VERY LOW PROFILE AND RARELY LEAVES HIS HOUSE </p><p>BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL "CATCH" </p><p>HIM IF HE LEAVES HIS HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ANOTHER CASE, JO-000711, CURRENTLY WORKS WITH THE </p><p>IRAQI OPPOSITION, THE IRAQI NATIONAL ACCORD MOVEMENT (INA, AL </p><p>WIFAQ) HERE IN JORDAN.  THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR THE </p><p>INA REPORTEDLY ARE REQUIRED TO SLEEP IN THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE </p><p>THE INA BELIEVES IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM TO GO HOME DUE TO </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IN JORDAN.  THEIR </p><p>CHILDREN DO NOT GO TO SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE LOCKED THEMSELVES </p><p>IN THEIR HOMES AND CLOSED ALL THE DOORS AND SHUTTERS.  ALL </p><p>REFUGEES WORKING WITH THE IRAQI OPPOSITION (E.G. IRAQI </p><p>NATIONAL ACCORD MOVEMENT) CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY </p><p>OFFICIALS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRAVEL TO THEIR RESETTLEMENT </p><p>COUNTRIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE REFUGEES REPORT THAT </p><p>THERE ARE OTHER EVENTS OCCURRING BUT THE REFUGEES CANNOT </p><p>DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE AND IT IS UNSAFE FOR </p><p>THEM TO APPROACH AMEMBASSY AMMAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACCORDING TO UNHCR AMMAN, THE THIRD CASE, JO-000712, </p><p>HAS BEEN "TARGETED" BY IRAQI INTELLIGENCE AGENTS.  THE ENTIRE </p><p>FAMILY HAS GONE INTO HIDING AND IS MOVED FROM ONE SAFE HOUSE </p><p>TO ANOTHER ON A MONTHLY BASIS.  ONLY THE PROTECTION OFFICER </p><p>AT UNHCR KNOWS THE FAMILY\'S EXACT WHEREABOUTS.  THE SEVEN </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.  THEY ARE </p><p>TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, WHICH IS PROVING TO BE QUITE </p><p>DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UNHCR AMMAN REPORTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF IRAQI </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN JORDAN PRESENTS A PERMANENT RISK FOR </p><p>IRAQI REFUGEES WHO LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF BEING HARASSED OR </p><p>HAVING THEIR LIVES THREATENED IN JORDAN.  IN GENERAL, IRAQI </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CONTINUES TO SURVEIL AND HARASS SOME IRAQI </p><p>REFUGEES HERE IN JORDAN.  THEIR ACTIVITIES AND MOTIONS ARE </p><p>CONSTANTLY MONITORED.  REFUGEES REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED </p><p>ON THE STREETS AND HAVE HAD PEOPLE COME TO THEIR HOUSES </p><p>SEARCHING FOR THEM.  WHEN THE REFUGEES LEAVE THEIR HOUSES, </p><p>THEY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO UNHCR\'S MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING WITH THE GOJ, REFUGEES HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO </p><p>REMAIN IN JORDAN ONLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS </p><p>REFUGEES BY UNHCR.  AFTERWARDS, THEY RISK BEING SUBJECTED TO </p><p>DEPORTATION TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN (IN THIS CASE IRAQ). </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY CASES OF DEPORTATION OF </p><p>UNHCR-RECOGNIZED REFUGEES, UNHCR IS INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS THAT </p><p>THE GOJ WILL MOVE TO DEPORT RECOGNIZED REFUGEES WHO HAVE </p><p>OVERSTAYED THEIR LEGAL RESIDENCY, PARTICULARLY IF CONDITIONS </p><p>INSIDE JORDAN DETERIORATE. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) FINALLY, INCREASING TENSIONS IN THE REGION ARE </p><p>MAKING THESE 13 INS-APPROVED REFUGEES INCREASINGLY NERVOUS </p><p>ABOUT THEIR FATE.  IF WAR WERE TO OCCUR AND THE CURRENT </p><p>REGIME IN IRAQ WERE TO CHANGE, THE REFUGEES WONDER WHETHER </p><p>THEY WOULD BE RESETTLED OR GIVEN THE CHANCE TO RETURN HOME. </p><p>WOULD THEY LOSE REFUGEE STATUS ONCE THE CAUSE FOR FEAR OF </p><p>PERSECUTION IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS NO LONGER THERE? WE </p><p>WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE ON THESE QUESTIONS, AS WELL AS </p><p>TIMELY REVIEW OF SAO CLEARANCES FOR THE CASES DESCRIBED ABOVE. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
