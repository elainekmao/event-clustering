<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, LICC, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MORE ON BILATERAL AGREEMENT TO PROTECT </p><p>CITIZENS FROM INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 157638 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1416 </p><p>     C. STATE 135262 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya on August 23 </p><p>told DCM that Nepal has no disagreement with the USG\'s views </p><p>on the International Criminal Court (ICC).  Acharya was </p><p>clearly well informed about US views and interest in signing </p><p>bilateral accords against surrendering each other\'s citizens </p><p>to the ICC, as we explained at the Joint Secretary level on </p><p>July 17 (Ref B).  However, he said, Nepal was "not fond of </p><p>making agreements," and thus would have to deliberate further </p><p>before signing. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nepal has two main reservations about the ICC, Acharya </p><p>explained.  First, Nepal has concerns about the legal </p><p>liability of the Commander in Chief, who in Nepal\'s case is </p><p>its King.  (Note:  The King of Nepal is not only sovereign, </p><p>he is also traditionally considered to be an incarnation of a </p><p>Hindu god, Vishnu.  End Note.)  Second, Nepal was worried </p><p>that the ICC could compromise its sovereignty, no small </p><p>matter for a small country like Nepal, Acharya emphasized. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Embassy will continue to press the GON to sign the </p><p>draft bilateral agreement. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
