(U)  SUMMARY:  AT A NATIONAL SEMINAR ON TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS (TIP), GVN AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>PARTICIPANTS CONCLUDED THAT TIP IN VIETNAM AND THE REGION </p><p>APPEARS ON THE INCREASE, ALTHOUGH LITTLE RELIABLE DATA IS </p><p>AVAILABLE.  SRV LAW GENERALLY CONFORMS TO THE UN PROTOCOL TO </p><p>PREVENT, SUPPRESS, AND PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS - </p><p>ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  THERE ARE SOME KEY </p><p>DIFFERENCES:  SRV LAW IN SOME CASES DEFINES CHILDREN AS 16 </p><p>AND UNDER RATHER THAN 18 AND UNDER, AND IT DOES NOT </p><p>CURRENTLY INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS, </p><p>WITNESSES, OR MALES.

(U)  THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE (MOJ) AND UNICEF SPONSORED </p><p>A "NATIONAL SEMINAR ON INTERNATIONAL LAW ON TRAFFICKING OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03018  01 OF 03  190856Z </p><p>WOMEN AND CHILDREN" IN HANOI ON DECEMBER 6.  THE SEMINAR </p><p>REVIEWED THE CURRENT STATUS OF TIP, SRV LAWS RELATING TO </p><p>TRAFFICKING, INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS AGAINST TIP, AND DISCUSSED WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE </p><p>DONE ADDITIONALLY AND HOW THE SRV WOULD BENEFIT FROM SIGNING </p><p>AND IMPLEMENTING THE UN PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS, AND </p><p>PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS - ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN.  SPEAKERS INCLUDED VICE MINISTER OF JUSTICE HA </p><p>HUNG CUONG, UNICEF COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVE ANTHONY BLOOMBERG, </p><p>DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTORS FROM THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>(MFA), MOJ, AND MOLISA, AND AN EXPERT FROM UNICEF. </p><p>PARTICIPANTS FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE, THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT, THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>PROCURACY, AND OXFAM QUEBEC POSED QUESTIONS AT VARIOUS </p><p>POINTS.  REPRESENTATIVES OF A NUMBER OF OTHER GVN </p><p>MINISTRIES, SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND AT </p><p>LEAST TEN EMBASSIES BROUGHT TOTAL ATTENDANCE TO ALMOST 50. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UPDATE ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS INDICATED THAT THE VOLUME OF </p><p>TIP IN VIETNAM AND THE MEKONG SUB-REGION IS INCREASING, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO ONE OFFERED CONCRETE NUMBERS ON THE SIZE OF THE </p><p>INCREASE.  MFA INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND TREATIES DEPARTMENT </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR NGUYEN TRUONG GIANG CITED LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>FIGURES FOR THE PERIOD 1991 TO 1999 SHOWING THAT POLICE </p><p>DISCOVERED 2015 TIP CASES AND ARRESTED 3376 SUSPECTS, </p><p>LEADING TO 2895 PROSECUTIONS.  ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF CONVICTED </p><p>TRAFFICKERS WERE WOMEN, MOST OF THEM FORMER TRAFFICKING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03018  01 OF 03  190856Z </p><p>VICTIMS THEMSELVES.  THE POLICE ESTIMATE THAT 55.5 PERCENT </p><p>OF TIP IN VIETNAM IS INTERNATIONAL, WHILE 44.5 PERCENT IS </p><p>DOMESTIC.  A MOLISA OFFICIAL SAID THAT ABOUT 10,000 WOMEN </p><p>TRAFFICKING VICTIMS HAVE RETURNED TO VIETNAM IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS.  MR. TAI FROM THE PROCURACY NOTED THAT "HUNDREDS" OF </p><p>PEOPLE ARE TRIED FOR TRAFFICKING EVERY YEAR IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED MAJOR EXTERNAL CHALLENGES TO </p><p>REDUCING TRAFFICKING.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, CITED BY </p><p>UNICEF\'S BLOOMBERG AND MOLISA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL EVILS </p><p>PREVENTION DEPUTY DIRECTOR NGUYEN VAN MINH, IS THE STRONG </p><p>DEMOGRAPHIC PULL FACTOR CREATED BY CHINA\'S WEALTHIER AND </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY MALE POPULATION.  MINH ALSO ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF VIETNAMESE BRIDES GOING TO TAIWAN </p><p>ACTUALLY ENDED UP AS TRAFFICKING VICTIMS, WITH MOST OF THESE </p><p>FORCED INTO PROSTITUTION.  HE DESCRIBED THIS AS "AN ALARMING </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUE BETWEEN TAIWAN AND VIETNAM."  ANOTHER </p><p>CHALLENGE UNICEF AND MOJ STAFF CITED IS A GROWING ORGANIZED </p><p>CRIME INVOLVEMENT IN TIP, LARGELY BECAUSE IT IS "MORE </p><p>PROFITABLE THAN DRUG TRAFFICKING."  SOME CRIMINAL RINGS </p><p>APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED IN BOTH KINDS OF TRAFFICKING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>LAWS AND PROTOCOLS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1726 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03018  02 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>ACTION INL-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CA-01 </p><p>      CG-00    CIAE-00  CTME-00  DEAE-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EUR-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      VO-01    EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /022W </p><p>                  ------------------1A183F  190857Z /38 </p><p>R 190815Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8405 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0717 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 003018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03018  02 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  UNICEF RIGHTS PROMOTION PROJECT OFFICER VU NGOC </p><p>BINH PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS </p><p>IMPINGING ON TIP.  MFA INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND TREATIES </p><p>DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR GIANG OFFERED A DETAILED </p><p>TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF HIS VIEWS ON THE UN PROTOCOL ON </p><p>COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND ITS RELATION TO SRV </p><p>LAWS.  GIANG SAID THAT THE PROTOCOL IS "BASICALLY IN LINE </p><p>WITH CURRENT POLICY ON PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF CRIMES </p><p>AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 1992 CONSTITUTION AND LEGAL </p><p>SYSTEM."  HE RECOUNTED A LONG LIST OF SRV REGULATORY </p><p>MECHANISMS DEALING WITH TIP IN VARIOUS WAYS: ARTICLES 119 </p><p>AND 120 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE, WHICH OUTLAW TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>WOMEN AND CHILDREN; LABOR LAWS IMPINGING ON WORKER TRAINING </p><p>AND REGULATING LABOR EXPORT; EDUCATION LAWS RELATING TO </p><p>AWARENESS RAISING; GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND DECREES ON THE </p><p>MEDIA AND ADVERTISING; AND, MORE RECENT DECREES OUTLAWING </p><p>PRIVATE MARRIAGE BROKERAGE SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  GIANG NOTED SOME DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE PROTOCOL </p><p>AND SRV LAW.  THE CURRENT PENAL CODE DEFINES TRAFFICKING </p><p>MORE BROADLY AND "REQUIRES LESS BURDEN OF PROOF" THAN THE </p><p>PROTOCOL.  THE PENAL CODE DOES NOT PROVIDE A GENERAL </p><p>EXPLICIT DEFINITION OF THE TERM "A CHILD," ALTHOUGH </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN SRV LAW "A CHILD" IS DEFINED AS A PERSON UNDER </p><p>THE AGE OF 16.  (THE PROTOCOL DEFINES "A CHILD" AS A PERSON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03018  02 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>UNDER THE AGE OF 18.)  ACCORDING TO GIANG, VICTIMS ELIGIBLE </p><p>FOR REPATRIATION INCLUDE THOSE WHO RETAIN VIETNAMESE </p><p>NATIONALITY AND HAVE NO OTHER NATIONALITY, WHILE THE </p><p>PROTOCOL REQUIRES STATE PARTIES TO RECEIVE A VICTIM WHO HAS </p><p>THE RIGHT OF PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THAT STATE.  VIETNAM HAS </p><p>NOT CRIMINALIZED THE TRAFFICKING OF MALES, WHICH THE </p><p>PROTOCOL STIPULATES.  THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE HAS NO </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR PROTECTION OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF </p><p>TRAFFICKING.  FINALLY, ACCORDING TO GIANG, VIETNAM DOES NOT </p><p>OBLIGE ALL TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL </p><p>PASSENGERS POSSESS TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A </p><p>CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO REPORT TIP, SHOULD A </p><p>PERSON BECOME AWARE OF SUCH. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>GVN RESPONSES TO TIP </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) COMMITTEE FOR SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN LUONG PHAN CU STATED THAT ALTHOUGH TIP "IS A </p><p>BURNING ISSUE" IN VIETNAM AND OTHER COUNTRIES, HE WAS </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER ALL WOULD LIVE UP TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS </p><p>UNDER THE TREATY.  MORE SPECIFICALLY, MFA\'S GIANG EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN OVER THE PROTOCOL\'S PROVISIONS FOR REPATRIATION OF </p><p>VICTIMS CONSTITUTING A FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL BURDEN THAT </p><p>A POOR COUNTRY SUCH AS VIETNAM COULD NOT SHOULDER.  UNICEF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BLOOMBERG CLARIFIED THAT THE PROTOCOL\'S </p><p>LANGUAGE IS FLEXIBLE REGARDING ITS HUMANITARIAN PROVISIONS </p><p>SUCH AS REPATRIATION AND CARRIES THE EXPECTATION THAT NGO\'S </p><p>AND CIVIL SOCIETY WILL CARRY SOME OF THIS LOAD.  LIKEWISE, </p><p>AN MFA INTERNATIONAL LAW AND TREATY EXPERT ASSURED MOJ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03018  02 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DEPUTY DIRECTOR VU DUC LONG THAT </p><p>IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CLOSE GAPS BETWEEN SRV LAW AND </p><p>ARTICLE 10 OF THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZED CRIME (TNOC), BECAUSE THE TNOC PERMITS THE </p><p>LIABILITY OF LEGAL PERSONS TO BE EITHER CRIMINAL, CIVIL, OR </p><p>AND ADMINISTRATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  UNICEF\'S BINH HIGHLIGHTED APPROACHES SOME OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES TAKE TO TIP, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>CENTRAL OFFICES FOR MONITORING TIP IN CAMBODIA AND THAILAND. </p><p>HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE US TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION </p><p>ACT OF 2002 AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF G/TIP WITHIN DOS.  HE </p><p>ALSO BRIEFLY REVIEWED THE DOS REPORT ON TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS AND DESCRIBED THE REPORT\'S TIERS AS, "TIER I: </p><p>EXEMPLARY EFFORTS; TIER II: MADE EFFORTS BUT NOT ELIMINATED; </p><p>TIER III: NOT MUCH EFFORT MADE."  VIETNAM\'S TIER WAS NOT </p><p>DISCUSSED.  BINH REMARKED THAT VIETNAM\'S CRIMINAL PENALTIES </p><p>FOR TIP ARE SEVERE, UP TO LIFE IN PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  MOLISA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL EVILS PREVENTION DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR NGUYEN VAN MINH CITED A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE HO </p><p>CHI MINH NATIONAL POLITICAL ACADEMY (THE MAIN CPV TRAINING </p><p>INSTITUTION AND THINK TANK) WHICH SHOWED THAT 19-20 PERCENT </p><p>OF LEADERS DID NOT KNOW ABOUT TIP "RELEVANT DOCUMENTS" AND </p><p>THAT A NUMBER OF PROVINCIAL LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT TIP IS </p><p>NOT IMPORTANT NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE "MORE PRESSING ISSUES" </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1727 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03018  03 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>ACTION INL-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CA-01 </p><p>      CG-00    CIAE-00  CTME-00  DEAE-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EUR-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      VO-01    EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /022W </p><p>                  ------------------1A1845  190857Z /38 </p><p>R 190815Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8406 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0718 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 003018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03018  03 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUCH AS POVERTY ELIMINATION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE GVN HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED A GOOD LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO WHICH LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>NEED TO PAY ATTENTION.  MINH RECOMMENDED THAT TIP PREVENTION </p><p>MUST BE INCLUDED IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  MOLISA </p><p>PREDICTS THAT, BY 2010, TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN </p><p>"WILL BE STOPPED." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  PARTICIPANTS FROM VARIOUS GVN ENTITIES AND UNICEF </p><p>DISCUSSED AND DEBATED WAYS TO IMPROVE HOW THE GVN DEALS WITH </p><p>TIP.  MOLISA AND MPS HAVE HAD THE LEAD ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SINCE 1997\'S PRIME </p><p>MINISTERIAL DECREE 766.  BINH OF UNICEF OPINED THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WITH WHOM </p><p>THEY SHOULD WORK -- MPS, MOLISA, THE WOMEN\'S UNION, OR SOME </p><p>OTHER ENTITY.  AN MOJ ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL LAW </p><p>DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL COMPLAINED THAT MOLISA HAS NOT </p><p>COORDINATED WITH MOJ ON THE NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION ON </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN IT IS DEVELOPING.  SHE </p><p>ALSO CONTRASTED SEEMINGLY GOOD INTERAGENCY COOPERATION IN </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES WITH THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM. </p><p>FINALLY, SHE QUESTIONED MOLISA\'S EMPHASIS ON VICTIMS WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN PROSTITUTES, WONDERING WHAT WAS BEING DONE FOR OTHER </p><p>TYPES OF VICTIMS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  MOJ REPRESENTATIVES SAID THAT THEY ARE TAKING AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03018  03 OF 03  190857Z </p><p>ACTIVE ROLE IN REVIEWING AND DRAFTING LAWS AND, TOGETHER </p><p>WITH MFA AND MPS, ARE ACTIVE IN LEGAL COOPERATION WITH </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY AND THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT EXPRESSED INTEREST </p><p>IN IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.  ACCORDING TO MOJ </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION LONG, VIETNAM </p><p>ENJOYS GOOD COOPERATION AND INFORMATION SHARING WITH </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND HAS LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES WITH </p><p>A NUMBER OF THEM, SPECIFICALLY CITING CHINA, LAOS, AND MORE </p><p>RECENTLY THE PHILIPPINES.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT CAMBODIA </p><p>HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO THE GVN\'S REQUEST TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH MOLISA HAS TECHNICALLY HAD THE </p><p>LEAD FOR NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED ASPECTS OF TIP, </p><p>ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL TIP, ITS "SOCIAL EVILS" APPROACH -- </p><p>WHILE ENERGETIC -- USUALLY CONCEPTUALIZES TIP IN AN </p><p>UNREALISTIC WAY.  THE FRUSTRATIONS MOJ OFFICIALS VOICED WITH </p><p>MOLISA ARE OFTEN HEARD FROM OTHER QUARTERS.  MANY WHO TRY TO </p><p>HELP TIP VICTIMS AND POTENTIAL VICTIMS WORK AROUND RATHER </p><p>THAN WITH MOLISA.  THEY OFTEN FAVOR COOPERATING WITH THE </p><p>WOMEN\'S UNION INSTEAD.  EFFORTS TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST TIP APPEAR MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY DOES NOT SHAPE ITS </p><p>FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH MOLISA\'S "SOCIAL EVILS" LENS.  THE </p><p>BOTTOM LINE REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT THE GVN AS A WHOLE HAS </p><p>DEMONSTRATED A WELCOME COMMITMENT AND WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS </p><p>TIP, AND HAS BEEN OPEN TO MANY FORMS OF HELP ON THE ISSUE. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03018  03 OF 03  190857Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
