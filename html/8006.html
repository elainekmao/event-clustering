<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 002471 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, ECON, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN SADC. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   THESE TWO REVIEWS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT PRESENT SOME NEW OR </p><p>DIFFERENT INFORMATION ON THE PICTURE. THE STUDY ON EUROPEAN </p><p>INVESTMENT INTO SOUTHERN AFRICA EMPHASIZED THAT ALL THE FIRMS SELL </p><p>LOCALLY, BUT ONLY 14% OF THE FOREIGN OWNED FIRMS EXPORT FROM THE </p><p>REGION. THEIR MAIN REASON FOR BEING IN SADC IS TO SELL TO SADC, </p><p>NOT TO EXPORT AND NOT BECAUSE SADC IS AN INEXPENSIVE PLACE TO </p><p>PRODUCE. AGOA IS CHANGING THIS, BUT MAINLY FOR TEXTILES AND </p><p>CLOTHING (WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAVE SADC ONCE PREFERENTIAL ACCESS </p><p>IS WITHDRAWN). PRIVATIZATION (INCLUDING PUBLIC-PRIVATE </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS) IS A GOOD WAY TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, BEING </p><p>THE REASON GIVEN FOR 19% OF THE FIRMS BEING HERE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   FDI IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO CREATE JOBS. WHILE A QUARTER </p><p>EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT, A THIRD CONTRACTED EMPLOYMENT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. </p><p>TWO-THIRDS OF THE FOREIGN FIRMS EMPLOY EXPERTS; IN 1/3 OF THE </p><p>CASES THERE WAS LOCALIZATION OF FOREIGN POSITIONS, THUS DECREASING </p><p>THE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS AND INCREASING TECH TRANSFER. </p><p> </p><p>3.   HALF THE FOREIGN FIRMS EXPECT TO EXPAND IN THE NEXT FIVE </p><p>YEARS COMPARED TO 10% OF THE FIRMS (ALMOST ALL IN ZIMBABWE) WHO EXPECT </p><p>TO CONTRACT. </p><p> </p><p>4.   INCENTIVES WILL NOT WORK IN ATTRACTING FIRMS TO SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA AS THEY COME DUE TO FACTORS NOT INFLUENCED BY INCENTIVES </p><p>(SIZE OF THE MARKET, PRIVATIZATION, AND PERSONAL REASONS) BUT WILL </p><p>5. WORK IN DECIDING LOCATION ONCE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO COME TO </p><p>THE REGION. THIS MAKES INCENTIVES ESSENTIALLY A ZERO-SUM GAME FOR </p><p>THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>6.   THE REVIEW OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AFRICA NOTED THAT TOTAL </p><p>RESOURCE FLOWS TO NON-SOUTH AFRICA SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  HAVE FALLEN </p><p>SLIGHTLY SINCE THE EARLY 90S BUT THIS IS BECAUSE OF REDUCED </p><p>FOREIGN DONOR LOANS (REDUCED WORLD BANK ACTIVITY). THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT AND FOREIGN DONOR </p><p>GRANTS HAVE BEEN ROUGHLY CONSTANT. THE PICTURE IS DIFFERENT FROM </p><p>OTHER REGIONS WHICH HAD A LARGE EXPANSION IN FOREIGN DIRECT AND </p><p>FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN THE MID-90S BUT WHICH HAVE HAD </p><p>REDUCTIONS SINCE THEN. </p><p> </p><p>7.   ALSO INTERESTING IS THAT FDI IN ALL OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAD </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR 3.6% OF TOTAL INVESTMENT IN THESE COUNTRIES IN THE </p><p>EARLY 90S, BUT ACCOUNTS FOR OVER 11% NOW. WITH FDI INCREASING IN </p><p>ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS, THE PICTURE EMERGES THAT IT IS NOT FDI THAT IS </p><p>ABANDONING SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, IT IS AFRICAN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, </p><p>AND FOREIGNERS ARE NOT INVESTING ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THIS </p><p>DECREASE. </p><p> </p><p>8.   US DATA SHOWS THAT THE RATE OF RETURN ON AFRICAN INVESTMENTS </p><p>IS THE HIGHEST OF ANY REGION, 21% NOW COMPARED TO 30% IN THE EARLY </p><p>90S. WHILE SOME ARGUE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE OF GREATER VOLATILITY </p><p>IN RETURNS IN AFRICA THE DATA DOES NOT BEAR THEM OUT. AFRICA\'S </p><p>VARIABILITY IN RETURNS IS CLOSE TO THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>LOWER THAN THE VARIABILITY IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THE AVERAGE </p><p>RETURNS ARE LESS. PERCEPTIONS OF RISK ARE HIGHER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   THIS SUMMARIZES PAPERS PRESENTED AT A WORKSHOP ORGANIZED BY </p><p>THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY ON 9 APRIL 2003.  THE FIRST DEALS </p><p>WITH EUROPEAN INVESTMENT IN SADC AND THE SECOND WITH FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE PRESENTATION WAS PART OF AN </p><p>EFFORT BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY TO PRESENT NEW RESEARCH ON </p><p>TOPICS OF CRUCIAL INTEREST TO SA. </p><p> </p><p>JENKINS AND THOMAS: FDI IN SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE JENKINS/THOMAS PAPER IS A RESULT OF INTERVIEWS WITH 81 </p><p>UK, SWISS AND GERMAN FIRMS ON THEIR INVESTMENTS IN SADC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHY INVEST IN SADC? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>?    84% - SIZE OF THE LOCAL MARKET, </p><p>?    40% - LOCAL RAW MATERIALS </p><p>?    26% - PERSONAL REASONS </p><p>?    21% - STRATEGIC REASONS (NEAR PARTNERS) </p><p>?    19% - PRIVATIZATION OR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  FIRMS ARE IN SADC TO SELL TO SADC, NOT  FOR EXPORT (EXCEPT </p><p>FOR THE MINERAL COMPANIES) AND NOT BECAUSE THE AREA IS A CHEAP </p><p>PLACE TO PRODUCE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE REGION FOR THE LOCAL </p><p>ORE FOREIGN FIRMS WILL INVEST, BUT THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO INVEST </p><p>IN SA. </p><p> </p><p>12.  MORE INTERESTING IS THEIR RESULTS ON THE DESTINATION OF THE </p><p>OUTPUT FROM THEIR INVESTMENT. ALL SUPPLIED THE LOCAL MARKET, WITH </p><p>45% SUPPLIED THE REGIONAL MARKET AND 14% EXPORTED OUTSIDE THE </p><p>REGION. FOR ALMOST ALL FIRMS THE REASON FOR INVESTING IS LOCAL, </p><p>NOT TO USE SADC AS A BASE FOR EXPORTS (TEXTILES AND GARMENT </p><p>MANUFACTURERS ESTABLISHED DUE TO AGOA ARE A RECENT NON-EUROPEAN </p><p>EXCEPTION). </p><p> </p><p>13.  ALL OF THE NON-PRIMARY SECTOR FIRMS EXPORTING GLOBALLY ARE IN </p><p>SA AND THEIR ORIGINAL REASON FOR COMING TO THE REGION WAS TO </p><p>SUPPLY THE LOCAL MARKET. ELSEWHERE IN SADC FIRMS SELLING LOCALLY </p><p>ARE NOT DEVELOPING AN EXPORT CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  IMPLICATION SADC: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST BOTH THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF EXPANDING THE REGIONAL MARKET TO INCLUDE SADC AS THE LARGER MARKET </p><p>WILL ATTRACT ADDITIONAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND THE NEED TO MAKE </p><p>CROSS-BORDER MOVEMENTS EASY. AT PRESENT SA WILL ATTRACT NEW </p><p>INVESTMENT TO SELL INTO SADC BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE SA MARKET. </p><p>TO OVERCOME THIS ADVANTAGE, SADC MUST MAKE THE REGION APPEAR AS </p><p>ONE. UNLESS THAT OCCURS, THE BENEFITS OF FDI IN TERMS OF INCOME </p><p>AND JOBS WILL FLOW OVERWHELMINGLY TO SA. </p><p> </p><p>JOB IMPACT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  FDI IS USUALLY PRESENTED AS CRITICAL TO JOB AND INCOME </p><p>GROWTH. UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A QUARTER OF THE FIRMS EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT </p><p>IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS (AND MOST OF THESE WERE NEW INVESTMENTS) WITH </p><p>OVER A THIRD CONTRACTING. ONLY HALF OF THE FIRMS THAT EXPANDED </p><p>PRODUCTION RECENTLY ALSO EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT WITH A NUMBER </p><p>EXPANDING PRODUCTION AND DECREASING EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THERE ARE FREQUENTLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>FOREIGNERS EMPLOYED, AND 2/3 OF THE FIRMS HAD EXPERTS BUT 1/3 HAD </p><p>LOCALIZED PREVIOUSLY FOREIGN POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>FUTURE PLANS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  ALMOST 2/3 OF THE FIRMS HAVE EXPANDED (OR STARTED) IN THE </p><p>LAST FIVE YEARS AND JUST OVER HALF PLAN TO EXPAND IN THE COMING YEARS. </p><p>ONLY 8% HAVE CONTRACTED OF LATE AND 10% EXPECT TO CONTRACT IN THE </p><p>COMING YEARS. MOST OF THE CONTRACTIONS ARE CONCENTRATED IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. THE PICTURE FOR THE REST OF THE REGION IS THUS MUCH MORE </p><p>OPTIMISTIC PICTURE. </p><p> </p><p>TYPE OF INVESTMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  HALF THE NEW INVESTMENTS WERE GREENFIELD (NEW ENTITY) AND </p><p>MOST OF THESE ARE IN SERVICES AND USUALLY ARE WHOLLY CONTROLLED BY </p><p>THE FOREIGN OWNER. ACQUISITIONS, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IN </p><p>PRIMARY PRODUCTION, ARE USUALLY WITH A LOCAL PARTNER. THESE </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR JUST OVER 1/3 OF THE TOTAL BUT ARE OF INCREASING </p><p>IMPORTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>LEAPE: FDI IN AFRICA </p><p>-------------------- </p><p></p><p>19.  LEAPE\'S PAPER IS A REVIEW OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DATA ON FDI. </p><p> </p><p>20.  IN THE 90\'S RESOURCE FLOWS TO NON-SA SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA </p><p>DROPPED SLIGHTLY. BUT THE DROP WAS ALMOST SOLELY DUE TO THE </p><p>REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM OFFICIAL LOANS (ESSENTIALLY THE WORLD BANK) </p><p>WITH FOREIGN GRANTS REASONABLY STEADY AND PRIVATE FDI INCREASING. </p><p>PRIVATE FDI TO NON-OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES GREW SLIGHTLY FASTER </p><p>THAN FDI TO OIL PRODUCERS AND THE TWO ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL NOW. </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANK LENDING, NEVER VERY HIGH, BECAME ESSENTIALLY </p><p>NEGATIVE AS REPAYMENTS BECAME GREATER THAN NEW LOANS. </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE SITUATION WITH ALL LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES IS DIFFERENT. FDI </p><p>(AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT) OUTSIDE AFRICA BOOMED IN THE MID-90S </p><p>AND THUS THE COLLAPSE IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT AND THE REDUCTION IN </p><p>FDI HAD A MUCH GREATER IMPACT IN THE LATE 90S AND EARLY IN THE NEW </p><p>CENTURY. COMMERCIAL BANK LENDING WAS MORE IMPORTANT EARLY IN THE </p><p>90S BUT, AS IN AFRICA, HAS TURNED NEGATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  ALL OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\'S SHARE OF FDI HAS FALLEN SINCE THE </p><p>80S, BUT HAS BEEN ROUGHLY CONSTANT AT 3.4% SINCE THE MID-90S. THE </p><p>SAME PATTERN EMERGES EVEN IF WE EXCLUDE OIL-PRODUCING AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE 80S FDI IN NON-OIL EXPORTERS IN </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA WAS 3.6% OF THE REGION\'S TOTAL INVESTMENT WHILE IT IS OVER </p><p>11% NOW. FOR LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES GENERALLY THE INCREASE WAS ONLY </p><p>FROM 3.3% TO 7.9%. THIS APPEARS TO CHANGE THE CONCLUSION FROM </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS ABANDONING AFRICA TO ONE OF DOMESTIC AFRICAN </p><p>INVESTORS ABANDONING AFRICA. THE INCREASE IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS </p><p>INSUFFICIENT TO MAKE UP THE FALL IN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.  IN ANY </p><p>CASE, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS FOR 89% OF TOTAL INVESTMENT, </p><p>ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID ON INCREASING IT, FINDING WHY ITS </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMY HAS FALLEN, WHY RESIDENTS ARE NOT </p><p>INVESTING. </p><p> </p><p>24.  US DATA SHOWS THAT CURRENTLY THERE IS A 21% RETURN ON </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; IT HAD BEEN 30% IN THE EARLY </p><p>90S. THE AVERAGE RETURN IS MUCH HIGHER THAN FOR ANY OTHER REGION. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE THE AVERAGE RETURN IS 9.5% IN SOUTH AMERICA AND 14.8% </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHILE THE VARIANCE IN INVESTMENT IN SUB- </p><p>SAHARAN AFRICA IS HIGHER, THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION IS </p><p>APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BETTER THAN IN </p><p>SOUTH AMERICA. THE VARIABILITY IS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN IN ANY </p><p>OF THE RICHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUME </p><p></p></div>
