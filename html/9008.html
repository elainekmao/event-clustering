MP Busairi goes on to denounce normalization </p><p>of relations with Israel saying, "We reject reconciliation </p><p>with the traitorous Jews, the grandchildren of monkeys and </p><p>pigs."

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. News stories: This week, Al-Qabas and Kuwait University </p><p>conducted a poll of "Kuwaiti voters" on various issues, and </p><p>Al-Qabas published the results on their front pages this </p><p>week. According to the poll, 90% of respondents believe that </p><p>the government and the National Assembly are involved in </p><p>corruption; 65% oppose giving women the right to vote or to </p><p>stand for office; and 65% oppose the appointment of a woman </p><p>as a minister. </p><p> </p><p>Sheikh Jaber Al-Duaij Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to </p><p>Saudi Arabia, denies local media reports that appeared </p><p>earlier in the week of scores of Kuwaitis being detained in </p><p>Saudi Arabia for links to Al-Qaeda, saying that no Kuwaiti </p><p>is in police custody in Saudi Arabia, Al-Rai Al-Aam reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah and Al-Qabas ran a front-page advertisement this </p><p>week from the Kuwaiti Committee for Consoling the Families </p><p>of Coalition Forces who Lost their Lives while Liberating </p><p>Iraq, soliciting donations for the families of Coalition </p><p>soldiers killed in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>On June 25, Al-Watan reports on its front page that </p><p>according to the State Department\'s Annual Human Rights </p><p>Report, the Human Rights situation in 15 Middle Eastern </p><p>countries, including Kuwait, is "dangerous." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports that the Chairman of the Carnegie Endowment </p><p>for International Peace and the Editor-in-Chief of Foreign </p><p>Policy magazine sent a joint letter to Secretary of State </p><p>Colin Powell expressing great concern over the Kuwaiti </p><p>government\'s decision to refer Mohammed Al-Jassim, editor-in- </p><p>chief of Al-Watan newspaper, to the Public Prosecutor. </p><p> </p><p>Al- Watan and Al-Anba report that Islamist MP Mohammed Al- </p><p>Busairi stated in a public electoral seminar that "we reject </p><p>reconciliation with the traitorous Jews, the grandchildren </p><p>of monkeys and pigs," and that the new National Assembly </p><p>will announce a war on Islamists under the pretext of </p><p>combating terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>On June 23, Al-Qabas reports that the Council of Ministers </p><p>is considering a strategy to "reform and upgrade" the </p><p>educational system in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>On June 22, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Al-Sabah said that a new date for a visit by </p><p>President Bush to Kuwait will "be agreed upon by both </p><p>parties," Al-Rai Al-Aam reports. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report on June 25 the one-day visit of </p><p>Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs </p><p>William Burns\' to Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>3. "Why Saud Al-Sabah?" </p><p>Liberal Political Science Professor at Kuwait University, </p><p>Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (6/24): </p><p>"Political Islamist groups in Kuwait continue to attack the </p><p>person of Sheikh Saud Naser Al-Sabah. [because] he is the </p><p>only member of the ruling family to have publicly stated. </p><p>that political Islamist groups pose the gravest danger to </p><p>Kuwait\'s future and that of the region. However, not one </p><p>Kuwaiti, or any of Kuwait\'s leaders, have supported his </p><p>position. Sheikh Saud and other Kuwaiti youths are proud of </p><p>their ties to the United States, because they realize that </p><p>Kuwait\'s higher interests demand the cementing of these </p><p>ties. manifested by the establishment of friendship </p><p>societies with the United States, the latest being the </p><p>Kuwaiti Committee for Consoling the Families of Coalition </p><p>Forces who Lost their Lives while Liberating Iraq. Let us </p><p>together work to oust all [parliamentary] candidates hostile </p><p>to the United States who are attempting to turn our country </p><p>into a base for the `New Taliban\' and terrorists." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Sheikh Saud Al-Sabah\'s Crime" </p><p>Hasan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Qabas (6/24):  "If </p><p>Saud Al-Sabah, former Minister of Oil and of Information, is </p><p>the Ahmad Chalabi of Kuwait-- meaning America\'s man in </p><p>Kuwait-- as described by [Islamist and member of the Islamic </p><p>Constitutional Movement] MP Mohammed Al-Busairi, then, the </p><p>[Islamic] Constitutional Movement is the National Command of </p><p>the Fundamentalist ruling Baath Party. [T]he establishment </p><p>of the Kuwaiti Committee for Consoling the Families of </p><p>Coalition Forces who Lost their Lives while Liberating Iraq </p><p>intensified the [Islamic] Constitutional Movement\'s </p><p>resentment [of Sheikh Saud]. Saud wanted to compensate for </p><p>deficit in Kuwait\'s position toward the United States which </p><p>has long called for political and economic reforms in Kuwait </p><p>and the need to curb the powers of the [Islamic] </p><p>fundamentalists. The sad result is evident for everyone to </p><p>see: the marginalization of Kuwait by the American </p><p>administration, as when President Bush abstained from </p><p>visiting here." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The First Deputy Prime Minister is not the President" </p><p>Former Secretary General of the Kuwait Democratic Forum, </p><p>Ahmed Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/23): </p><p>"The post of the First Deputy Prime Minister is a fabricated </p><p>position. that has no constitutional basis.   Therefore, it </p><p>is not constitutionally valid for a Prime Minister to </p><p>delegate to a `first deputy\' the task of forming a </p><p>government. The constitution must be followed in letter and </p><p>in spirit. if, as we allege, we are a state comprised of </p><p>institutions and based on a constitution." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Gulf Roadmap" </p><p>Ahmed Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/21): </p><p>"The American administration is preparing to announce a </p><p>`Gulf Roadmap\' modeled on the Israeli-Palestinian one, </p><p>according to the former Secretary General of the GCC, </p><p>Abdullah Bishara. On a recent visit to the United States, he </p><p>met with American officials, one of whom was Elizabeth </p><p>Cheney, the Vice President\'s daughter, who is overseeing </p><p>Colin Powell\'s famed Middle East Partnership project. [The </p><p>Gulf Road Map] may soon be announced to urge the GCC </p><p>countries to speed up political, educational and economic </p><p>reforms according to a `liberal\' perspective. This would be </p><p>part of a wider project, to rearrange the region, in which </p><p>the overthrow of Saddam\'s regime was just the first phase." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Punishment Alone is not enough" </p><p>Khadyer Al-Anizi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (6/25):  "A </p><p>regional campaign to counter terrorism, must begin with </p><p>severe punishment against those who exploit our religion. </p><p>It must begin by solving all societal problems, and by </p><p>thinking of comprehensive development. This can be achieved </p><p>through a new curriculum, the acceptance of different </p><p>cultures, building of civil society and establishing a state </p><p>based on strong institutions and justice. Only then will </p><p>extremists be defeated." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Between Disregard and Attention" </p><p>Ahmed Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/25): </p><p>"For a while now, official American statements have ignored </p><p>Kuwait, either by ignoring Kuwait\'s role in the war to </p><p>overthrow Saddam, or by failing to mention `Kuwaiti </p><p>democracy.\' But, during the past few weeks, a change has </p><p>occurred. American attention toward Kuwait was renewed. </p><p>This was manifested through a phone call from President Bush </p><p>to the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister. Then, there were words of </p><p>praise by General Tommy Franks during a ceremony where he </p><p>was decorated with a medal. Thirdly, according to `Al-Watan </p><p>Al-Arabi\' publication, is charging National Security Adviser </p><p>Condoleezza Rice to oversee Kuwait\'s internal affairs and </p><p>future. The publication also claims that Secretary of State </p><p>Colin Powell will soon visit Kuwait. Finally, Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, William Burns </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>visits Kuwait today to deliver important messages. This </p><p>increased attention must carry within its folds some </p><p>entitlements which may be of dimensions no less great than </p><p>the previous disregard." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
