<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SENIOR BANKING OFFICIALS CONCERNED OVER GOT ECON </p><p>POLICY DRIFT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2010 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  In frank discussions March 26 and 27, BRSA </p><p>Chairman Engin Akcakoca and the outgoing Chairman of the </p><p>State Bank Board Safa Ocak told us of concerns with the lack </p><p>of market confidence in the government.  They described a </p><p>situation of policy drift on the economy, with Deputy PM </p><p>Sener\'s influence on the wane, MinFinance Unakitan\'s rising </p><p>and, per Akcakoca, a PM who is impervious to the logic of </p><p>financial markets.  The AK Party continues to make populist </p><p>signals to its constituencies even while implementing </p><p>reforms, they noted.  Neither Akcakoca nor Ocak had solutions </p><p>to what they see as a growing risk of debt default, though </p><p>the outgoing Ocak said he hoped the U.S. would help keep </p><p>Turkey firmly anchored in the West.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) "Trust in the government is minimal," according to </p><p>Banking Regulatory and Supervision Board Chairman Engin </p><p>Akcakoca, summing up recent contacts with the banking </p><p>community.  He noted the Babacan and others are trying to </p><p>blame everything on Iraq, when in fact it\'s more a crisis of </p><p>confidence in the government.  Asked about the market impact </p><p>of the GOT\'s recently announced fiscal measures, Akcakoca </p><p>said no one trusts AK to implement what they promise.  "If </p><p>Dervis had made these statements, the markets would have </p><p>reacted.  But not to these guys." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Akcakoca described a March 21 meeting between PM </p><p>Erdogan and the GOT economic team (including Deputy PM Sener, </p><p>MinState Babacan, MinFin Unakitan, CenBank Governor </p><p>Serdengecti, Treasury U/S Oztrak, State Planning U/S Tiktik). </p><p> The team counseled Erdogan not to use the word "surprise," </p><p>that the markets like stability not surprises.  Erdogan </p><p>rejected the advice, saying President Bush surprises his </p><p>audiences all the time.  "Erdogan is maybe a good politician </p><p>but has no understanding for economic policy.  Gul was </p><p>better." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Asked who was likely to take charge of economic </p><p>policy under Erdogan, Akcakoca pointed to Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan.  Unakitan is a problem-solver, he said.  Deputy PM </p><p>Sener doesn\'t want to take responsibility for anything, is a </p><p>real bureaucrat, and opposes the IMF.   MinState Babacan has </p><p>underperformed, lost his credibility and may well get fired. </p><p>Akcakoca noted PM Erdogan has stripped privatization away </p><p>from Sener and gave it to Unakitan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Akcakoca stressed the populist impulse that still </p><p>motivates AK Party.  Sener, in his March 26 statement on </p><p>privatization (reftel), had again assured the Turkish public </p><p>that privatization won\'t lead to public sector lay-offs. </p><p>Meanwhile, Akcakoca continued, he had had to lay-off nearly </p><p>30,000 in the banking sector in the process of intervening </p><p>and resolving 20 banks over the past two years.  He is facing </p><p>several ongoing law suits for doing it. The state bank board </p><p>had laid off another 35,000 in the state banks.  "Sener and </p><p>AK don\'t trust the IMF.  His solution is to print money." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Asked how this mood of pessimism will affect upcoming </p><p>debt roll-overs, Akcakoca said the banks will roll-over their </p><p>T-bill portfolios on April 8, but won\'t want to increase </p><p>their T-bill exposure.  He sees default risks increasing, </p><p>given the short maturities of T-bill issuances (likely three </p><p>months) and high interest rates. </p><p>implying the default. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Outgoing Chairman of the State Bank Board Safa Ocak </p><p>told us on March 28 he was confident that after two years of </p><p>independent operations (under first Vural Akisik and then </p><p>him), the state banks were in good shape.  It would be </p><p>difficult, he ventured, for the GOT to shift them back to </p><p>providing subsidized loans at GOT instruction.  Ocak said it </p><p>would be difficult to privatize Halk Bank this year, though </p><p>he had initially hoped to do so, given worsening market </p><p>sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ocak, like Akcakoca, is concerned with market </p><p>sentiment.  He noted, "this government continues to widen its </p><p>existing credibility gap with the markets."  Asked about the </p><p>state banks\' ability to help the Treasury meet additional </p><p>debt roll-over demands, Ocak said the state banks will </p><p>continue to participate in debt auctions, and they had helped </p><p>the GOT at the March 17 auction when demand had been low, but </p><p>their ability to absorb additional T-bill exposure was quite </p><p>limited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ocak closed by underscoring a widely felt concern in </p><p>the financial community here with maintaining strong U.S. - </p><p>Turkish relations.  "Since childhood, we have been lullabyed </p><p>by the notion that \'Turkey is geo-strategically important.\' </p><p>It may be true, but it was used to blur our realities and </p><p>give us a false sense of grandeur.  Now we\'re beginning to </p><p>face realities, and we need the U.S. to be patient.  Turks </p><p>tend to listen to the West more than some others do.  I </p><p>believe the U.S. has the ability to keep us firmly anchored </p><p>in the West." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
