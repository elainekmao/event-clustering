<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, INL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, AFMLS, AND NDDS </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  2002-2003 International Narcotics Control </p><p>Strategy Report (INSCR) Part II Financial Crimes and Money </p><p>Laundering - Maldives </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 State 240035 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Provided below is Post\'s response to reftel request for </p><p>information on Maldives\' regulations and practices </p><p>regarding financial crimes and money laundering.  This </p><p>submission is based on information received from the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Maldives and other </p><p>publicly available documents. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Maldives is not considered an important regional </p><p>financial center.  The financial sector of the Maldives is </p><p>very narrowly based with five commercial banks (one </p><p>international bank, three branches of public banks from </p><p>neighboring countries and one state owned Maldives Bank), </p><p>two insurance companies, a government provident fund, and a </p><p>leasing company.  HSBC set up in 2002 is the only </p><p>international bank operating in Maldives.  HSBC\'s strong </p><p>regulatory, supervisory and disclosure standards are </p><p>expected to improve the financial sector in Maldives.  The </p><p>International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank </p><p>group has invested in a joint venture leasing company </p><p>recently.  There are no offshore banks and finance </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p>Laws and Regulations to prevent money laundering </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) is the regulatory </p><p>agency for the financial sector.  MMA has authority to </p><p>supervise the banking system through Maldives Monetary </p><p>Authority Act and regulations on banks and financial </p><p>institutions.  These laws and regulations provide MMA </p><p>access to records of financial institutions and allow it to </p><p>take actions against suspended criminal activities.  Banks </p><p>are required to report any unusual movement of funds </p><p>through the banking system on a daily basis following </p><p>events of September 11.  There is no specific legislation </p><p>to deal with money laundering but separate laws address </p><p>narcotics trade, terrorism, and corruption:  Law No 17/77 </p><p>on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances prohibits </p><p>consumption and trafficking of narcotics.  The law also </p><p>prohibits laundering of proceeds from narcotics trade. </p><p>(ii) Law No 2/2000 on Prevention and Prohibition of </p><p>Corruption prohibits corrupt activities by both public and </p><p>private sector officials.  It provides for the forfeiture </p><p>of proceeds and also empowers judicial authorities to </p><p>freeze accounts pending a court decision. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Government of Maldives has approved the development </p><p>of an Anti-Money Laundering Law and establishment of a </p><p>financial intelligence unit.  MMA is seeking technical </p><p>assistance from the US and the World Bank for these </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorist Finance </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Law no 10/90 on Prevention of Terrorism in the Maldives </p><p>deals with some aspects of money laundering and terrorist </p><p>financing.  The law defines terrorist offences and acts of </p><p>terrorism which include causing and attempting to cause </p><p>death and bodily harm, instilling fear into a person or the </p><p>public, kidnapping, hostage taking, hijacking, importation </p><p>and use of firearms, ammunition, explosives, dealing in </p><p>firearms and related items and setting fire and causing </p><p>damage to property.  Provision of funds or any form of </p><p>assistance towards the commissioning or planning any such </p><p>terrorist activity is unlawful. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MMA has issued "know your customer" directives and </p><p>other instructions to banks enforcing freeze order requests </p><p>received from the U.S. Government.  The MMA directives are </p><p>binding on the banks and other financial institutions. </p><p>According to the Maldives Foreign Ministry, MMA monitors </p><p>unusual financial transactions through banks, financial </p><p>institutions and money transfer companies through its bank </p><p>supervision activities.  To date, there have been no known </p><p>cases of terrorist financing activities through banks in </p><p>Maldives.  The four foreign banks operating in the country </p><p>also follow instructions issued with regard to terrorist </p><p>financing by their parent organizations. </p><p> </p><p>International Cooperation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Key officials of the Maldives Law Commission, Attorney </p><p>General\'s office and the MMA attended several conferences </p><p>on combating money laundering and terrorism in 2002.  In </p><p>July 2002, OECD concluded that the Maldives is not a tax </p><p>haven.  OECD said that Maldives does not have an offshore </p><p>sector in financial services and is heavily transparent. </p><p>OECD also reported that Maldives does not have </p><p>administrative practices that prevent the effective </p><p>exchange of information.  According to an IMF staff report </p><p>dated December 2002, Maldivian authorities believe that the </p><p>Maldives is in line with international guidelines to combat </p><p>money laundering and financing of terrorism.  The IMF </p><p>deferred a discussion on the subject as data were still </p><p>being compiled at the time of the IMF mission. </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
