<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DISASTER DECLARATION </p><p> </p><p>1.   Niact Immediate precedence required because of urgent </p><p>humanitarian crisis. Notification to USAID/OFDA and STATE/AF </p><p>duty officers requested. Niact immediate precedence </p><p>authorized by CDA Andrews. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Charge d\'Affaires, after consulting with the </p><p>Ambassador, has declared a natural disaster in Nigeria </p><p>because of extensive flooding caused by torrential rainfall </p><p>and overflowing of the Tiga and Challawa reservoirs in </p><p>northern Nigeria from August 26 through September 6, 2001. </p><p>The areas most affected lie within the Hadejia and Jama,are </p><p>river basins in Kano and Jigawa States.  Mission requests </p><p>authorization to apply $25,000 of the Ambassador\'s emergency </p><p>funds to this crisis, specifically to assist the Nigerian Red </p><p>Cross Society (NRCS) to provide food and non- food relief to </p><p>the victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  It will be necessary to provide the victims with a one- </p><p>month food ration, household utensils and non-food items, </p><p>like blankets, mats, plastic buckets and clothing, lanterns </p><p>and mosquito nets, transport and ancillary costs.  Assistance </p><p>will be channeled through the International Federation of the </p><p>Red Cross, which will then work with NRCS to deliver </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Health education and potable water will also be needed to </p><p>prevent outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. </p><p>It is hoped that some of the displaced victims will be able </p><p>to go back to their villages after the recession of the </p><p>floodwater. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Governor of Kano State requested assistance from USG </p><p>officials in a meeting held in his office in Kano.  The joint </p><p>State/USAID assessment team visited five local government </p><p>areas and five villages in Kano and Jigawa States.  Based on </p><p>their assessment and the report from NRCS, it is apparent </p><p>that the damage is severe, and the host government is unable </p><p>to respond adequately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The NRCS has concluded an initial assessment and has </p><p>submitted a proposal to USAID.  The NCRS proposal is for </p><p>$637,636 worth of commodities, but NCRS reports that much </p><p>more assistance, especially food and blankets, will be </p><p>needed.  While officials at the state and local government </p><p>levels are trying to respond to the crisis, the reaction of </p><p>Federal government and other international donor agencies has </p><p>been slow.  Members of the affected communities and some </p><p>business organizations have donated funds to assist the </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Estimates of the number of deaths, persons displaced, </p><p>damage to crops, and villages have been provided by the NRCS, </p><p>and the Jigawa and Kano State governments.  The latest </p><p>estimate of the number of deaths and displaced persons in </p><p>Kano state is 137 deaths and over 1,500,000 persons displaced </p><p>as a result of the disaster.  These are preliminary </p><p>estimates.  Based on the NRCS assessment, 180 deaths and </p><p>95,000 persons were displaced in Jigawa state. These numbers </p><p>will surely increase as all villages are assessed in coming </p><p>weeks.  Jigawa State has been cut in half by the flooding, </p><p>and huge areas are inaccessible by the means available to </p><p>local authorities and NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  The NRCS confirms that the current major and urgent needs </p><p>are: food, blankets, sanitation, lanterns, drinking water and </p><p>malaria prophylaxis drugs to the over 1,500,000 displaced </p><p>people currently taking refuge in primary schools and other </p><p>public buildings across the two states.  The combined efforts </p><p>of the local and state governments including NRCS have so far </p><p>fallen far short of the needs of the victims in the refugee </p><p>camps.  The NRCS have so far mobilized 60 volunteers for </p><p>search and rescue mission, and distributed 72 bags of rice, </p><p>20 bags of beans, 16 bags of millet and 20 kgs of vegetable </p><p>oil in two of the affected local governments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Mission further recommends that OFDA immediately </p><p>deploy an assessment team to thoroughly assess the situation </p><p>with a view to providing additional disaster assistance to </p><p>the victims.  Jigawa and Kano State governments plan to </p><p>relocate many of the villages, which will be a lengthy </p><p>process.  Most of those affected by the flooding are </p><p>subsistence farmers.  Besides the loss of dwellings, food and </p><p>clothing, there has been extensive crop loss throughout the </p><p>region.  Most of the victims will require sustained food and </p><p>economic aid over the next 18 months until next year\'s </p><p>harvest.  The rainy season in northern Nigeria is nearing its </p><p>end, but rains remain heavy.  Other areas in the lowlands of </p><p>Jigawa, Bauchi and Yobe states will suffer as the floodwaters </p><p>move eastward towards Lake Chad.  In a separate message, the </p><p>Mission will request authority for the use of operational </p><p>time of Operation Focus Relief helicopters to assist with </p><p>disaster assessment and aid-delivery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Providing assistance is in the interest of the U.S. </p><p>government.  Northern Nigeria has suffered intermittent </p><p>ethnic and religious violence.  As this cable is being </p><p>readied for transmission, the city of Jos appears to be </p><p>emerging from a spasm of inter-religious violence.  The U.S. </p><p>can demonstrate its impartial concern for people of all </p><p>faiths by responding to this emergency in predominantly </p><p>Muslim Kano and Jigawa States.  This disaster has resulted in </p><p>a large number of displaced persons who, if not properly </p><p>assisted, will likely migrate to urban areas in large </p><p>numbers, thereby increasing tensions in Kano, Kaduna and </p><p>elsewhere. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
