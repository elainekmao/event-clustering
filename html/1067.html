SUMMARY:  IN HIS FIRST WORKING VISIT TO NAM DINH </p><p>PROVINCE, JUST SOUTHEAST OF HANOI, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, TOURED A STATE-OWNED TEXTILE PLANT AND </p><p>VISITED NGO PROJECTS, LOCAL SCHOOLS AND A HOSPITAL.  THOUGH </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP IS OPEN AND ENGAGING, THE LARGELY </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PROVINCE IS NOT MOVING ENERGETICALLY TO CREATE </p><p>NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.  THE STATE-OWNED TEXTILE PLANT, </p><p>WHICH EMPLOYS 7,700 PEOPLE, PRODUCED ONLY 30 NEW JOBS LAST </p><p>YEAR.  INTERNATIONAL NGO\'S OPERATING IN NAM DINH HELP FILL </p><p>THE SOCIAL GAPS: THE ADVENTIST AID AGENCY ASSISTS BLIND </p><p>CHILDREN TO INTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY, WHILE SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN/USA PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTARY NUTRITION TO </p><p>MALNOURISHED INFANTS AND TODDLERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP PITCHES LOCAL INDUSTRIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2. IN AN APRIL 24 VISIT TO NAM DINH PROVINCE, WHOSE </p><p>PROVINCIAL CAPITAL IS ABOUT 75 KM SOUTHEAST OF HANOI, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR MET WITH PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TRAN TRUNG </p><p>AM, WHO BRIEFED HIM ON LOCAL CONDITIONS.  (AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF AND INTERPRETER.  AM WAS JOINED BY </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM THE PROVINCIAL EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND HEALTH </p><p>DEPARTMENTS.)  AMBASSADOR NOTED THIS WAS HIS FIRST WORKING </p><p>VISIT TO THE PROVINCE; HE POINTED OUT THERE ARE ONLY TEN </p><p>PROVINCES HE HAS NOT YET VISITED.  AM SAID NAM DINH IS THE </p><p>MOST POPULOUS PROVINCE OF THE RED RIVER DELTA, WITH 2 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00864  01 OF 03  251113Z </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE, LARGELY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE.   AM SAID </p><p>RICE IS THE LARGEST EXPORT; PIGS AND VEGETABLES ARE ALSO </p><p>LEADING COMMODITIES.  THERE IS AN IMPORTANT TEXTILE </p><p>INDUSTRY, ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE FRENCH; WHILE IT HAS </p><p>DECLINED SOMEWHAT IN RECENT YEARS, ITS MANAGERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>WORKING RECENTLY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION.  THE PROVINCE\'S </p><p>STATE-OWNED TEXTILE ENTERPRISES EXPORT ABOUT USD 40 MILLION </p><p>IN GOODS, INCLUDING PREPARED CLOTHING, EACH YEAR.  AM SAID </p><p>HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD EXPAND ITS INVESTMENT IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE, INCLUDING IN OIL EXPLORATION, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>ATTEMPTED BY THE SOVIETS. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT VIETNAM IS BLESSED WITH </p><p>MANY RESOURCES AND HAS GREAT ECONOMIC POTENTIAL.  THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S GREATEST ASSET IS ITS PEOPLE, WHO ARE CREATIVE AND </p><p>HARD WORKING.  BUT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES, </p><p>VIETNAM NEEDS CREATIVE LEADERSHIP.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID AM, </p><p>AS CHAIR OF NAM DINH, HAS TO LEAD HIS PROVINCE TO COMPETE </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IN ORDER TO GAIN </p><p>INVESTMENT.  HE SAID THERE ARE MANY AMERICANS WHO EXPLORED </p><p>INVESTING IN VIETNAM, ESPECIALLY DURING THE YEARS 1994-96, </p><p>BUT HAVE GONE ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE </p><p>U.S. WANTS VIETNAM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WANTS TO WORK WITH </p><p>VIETNAM TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY.  WITH </p><p>PROPER LEADERSHIP, NAM DINH PROVINCE COULD BE VERY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IN THE YEARS AHEAD.  HE NOTED A KEY OBSTACLE NOW </p><p>IS THE SRV\'S INABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD TO SIGN THE BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) NEGOTIATED BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES.  HE </p><p>NOTED A BTA IS KEY TO INCREASING U.S. INVESTORS\' CONFIDENCE; </p><p>A BTA WOULD OPEN UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF NEW INVESTMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00864  01 OF 03  251113Z </p><p> </p><p>4. IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, AM NOTED THE </p><p>PROVINCE IS LOOKING TO EXPAND ITS SEAFOOD EXPORTS; THESE </p><p>PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OUT OF HAIPHONG HARBOR.  AM SAID THE </p><p>JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IS ASSISTING THE PROVINCE TO IMPROVE </p><p>TRANSPORTATION LINKS AMONG NAM DINH, NINH BINH AND THAI BINH </p><p>PROVINCES TO ENCOURAGE TRADE WITH THAILAND.  AM NOTED BOTH </p><p>RAIL LINKS AND WATERWAYS WOULD BE IMPROVED TO FACILITATE </p><p>THIS TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>STATE-OWNED TEXTILE FACTORY CREATING FEW NEW JOBS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. THE AMBASSADOR VISITED THE PROVINCE\'S HUGE STATE-OWNED </p><p>TEXTILE FACTORY, WHICH EMPLOYS 7,700 PERSONS IN ALL ASPECTS </p><p>OF PRODUCTION.  THE FACTORY PRODUCES FINISHED CLOTHING </p><p>ITEMS, INCLUDING 100 PERCENT COTTON, 100 PERCENT POLYESTER, </p><p>AND BLENDED FABRICS.  RAW COTTON IS IMPORTED FROM </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN; POLYESTER IS IMPORTED FROM TAIWAN AND SOUTH </p><p>KOREA.  THE EQUIPMENT IN THE PLANT COMES FROM GERMANY, </p><p>BELGIUM, FRANCE, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.  FACTORY FLOOR </p><p>OPERATORS SAID CLOTHES ARE EXPORTED TO JAPAN, GERMANY, THE </p><p>CZECH REPUBLIC AND NUMEROUS OTHER MARKETS.  THEY CLAIMED 36 </p><p>PERCENT OF OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. DURING HIS VISIT, THE AMBASSADOR WAS SHOWN AROUND THE </p><p>FACTORY BY THREE PRODUCTION SECTION HEADS, TWO OF WHOM WERE </p><p>WOMEN.  THE FACILITIES WERE CLEAN, AND A CURSORY LOOK AT THE </p><p>FACILITIES SUGGESTED WORKING CONDITIONS WERE GENERALLY </p><p>ADEQUATE.  HOWEVER, THE AIR IN THE AREA WHERE COTTON AND </p><p>POLYESTER ARE SPUN INTO THREAD WAS THICK WITH DUST AND </p><p>FIBERS, AND NOT PARTICULARLY WELL VENTILATED.  SOME, BUT NOT </p><p>ALL, WORKERS WORE MASKS.  FACTORY REPRESENTATIVES SAID THE </p><p>EMPLOYEES WERE TRAINED AT THE LOCAL PROVINCIAL SCHOOL. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PLANT MANAGER, 30 NEW EMPLOYEES WERE HIRED </p><p>LAST YEAR.  (COMMENT: THAT ONLY 30 NEW JOBS WERE CREATED AT </p><p>THIS HUGE FACTORY AT A TIME WHEN VIETNAM IS SEEKING TO </p><p>EXPAND ITS EXPORTS SUGGESTS THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE LARGE </p><p>STATE-OWNED DINOSAURS THAT IS WEIGHING DOWN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC POTENTIAL.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>NGO\'S WORKING TO FILL UNMET LOCAL NEEDS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. ACCOMPANIED BY PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, AMBASSADOR VISITED </p><p>SEPARATE HUMANITARIAN PROJECTS OPERATED BY THE ADVENTIST </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND RELIEF AGENCY (ADRA) AND SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDRE/USA.  THE ADRA PROJECT HAS WORKED WITH THE NAM DINH </p><p>PROVINCIAL BLIND ASSOCIATION SINCE MAY 1999 TO TEACH BLIND </p><p>CHILDREN SKILLS TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY.  THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00864  02 OF 03  251113Z </p><p>FIRST PROJECT TAUGHT 13 CHILDREN FROM 10-15 YEARS OLD FOR </p><p>THREE MONTHS, AND THE SECOND CLASS, WHICH JUST BEGAN, </p><p>TEACHES AN ADDITIONAL 13 CHILDREN.  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH </p><p>STUDENTS WHO ARE LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE BRAILLE, IN </p><p>ORDER TO TAKE DICTATION AND LEARN MATH.  THEY ALSO RECEIVE </p><p>TRAINING IN HOW TO OPERATE MORE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  THE GOAL IS FOR THE STUDENTS TO JOIN REGULAR </p><p>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AFTER COMPLETING THE ADRA </p><p>COURSES.  FROM THE FIRST SCHOOL, TWO OF THE 13 STUDENTS ARE </p><p>TRAINING TO BECOME TEACHERS OF BRAILLE AND ONE IS BEING </p><p>TRAINED FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY MASSAGE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>APPLAUDED THE WORK OF THE ASSOCIATION AND ADRA IN HELPING </p><p>THE STUDENTS INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY, AND ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>STUDENTS TO CONTINUE THEIR HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT TO </p><p>LEARNING. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE AMBASSADOR ALSO VISITED A CHILD NUTRITION PROJECT </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN OPERATED BY SAVE THE CHILDREN/USA AT SIX </p><p>SITES FOR THE PAST 11 MONTHS.  THE PROJECT PROVIDES </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD TO MALNOURISHED CHILDREN UNDER 3 YEARS OLD </p><p>IN PARTICULARLY ISOLATED VILLAGES WHERE AT LEAST 16 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE POPULATION IS UNDERNOURISHED.  THE PROJECT HAS </p><p>TARGETTED MORE THAN 400 FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, HAVING </p><p>THE MOTHERS BRING THE KIDS INTO LOCAL VILLAGE CLINICS TO </p><p>RECEIVE THE DAILY PORTIONS OF RICE, GREEN LEAFY VEGETABLES </p><p>AND BANANAS.  SOME OF THE GOALS ARE TO TEACH THE PARENTS </p><p>ABOUT GOOD, COST-EFFICIENT EATING HABITS AND TO HELP AT-RISK </p><p>CHILDREN SO THEY DO NOT SUFFER LONG-TERM HARM TO THEIR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  VISITING THE FEEDING CENTER IN VINH HAO TOWN </p><p>IN VU BAN DISTRICT, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD THE PROJECT </p><p>OPERATORS HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PROGRAM AND ITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00864  02 OF 03  251113Z </p><p>EFFORTS TO REACH AT-RISK KIDS.   HE HOPED THAT SUCH PROJECTS </p><p>COULD BE EXPANDED TO HELP MALNOURISHED CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>TOURS OF PROVINCIAL HOSPITAL AND SCHOOLS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. IN A VISIT TO THE NAM DINH GENERAL HOSPITAL, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR MET WITH THE TWO VICE DIRECTORS AND TOOK A TOUR </p><p>OF THE FACILITIES.  THE HOSPITAL, WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN </p><p>THE REGION, HAS 400 BEDS AND 83 DOCTORS AND ABOUT 200 NURSES </p><p>ON STAFF.  RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, HOSPITAL </p><p>OFFICIALS SAID ABOUT 6 PERCENT OF PATIENTS ARE FOR SERIOUS </p><p>TRAUMA CASES, THOUGH MANY MORE TRAUMA PATIENTS GO TO THE </p><p>OTHER SMALLER CLINICS IN THE PROVINCE.  THERE ARE MANY TYPES </p><p>OF TRAUMA VICTIMS, FROM AUTO, FARM AND OTHER ACCIDENTS. </p><p>HOSPITAL OFFICIALS SAID, THOUGH THEIR DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT </p><p>IS LIMITED, THEY MAKE DO WITH WHAT THEY HAVE, THOUGH THEY </p><p>MADE A PITCH FOR SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT FROM THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE AMBASSADOR ALSO VISITED A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR BOYS </p><p>AND GIRLS TO HELP THEM LEARN THE WOODWORKING AND </p><p>CRAFTSMAKING SKILLS OF THE PROVINCE, AS WELL AS AN 18-ROOM </p><p>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT HAS 650 STUDENTS.  AT THE ELEMENTARY </p><p>SCHOOL, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH THE DEPUTY RECTOR, WHO </p><p>DESCRIBED THE CHALLENGES FACING HER SCHOOL BECAUSE OF </p><p>RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS.  SHE STRESSED THE STRONG COMMITMENT OF </p><p>LOCAL FAMILIES TO EDUCATION.  SHE ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR COULD ASSIST VIETNAM IN CONSTRUCTING AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM TO BE USED FOR A SCHOOL LAB, WHICH </p><p>REPORTEDLY WOULD COST $3,000.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR VISITED </p><p>FIRST- AND FIFTH-GRADE CLASSROOMS, HE SAW BETWEEN 34 AND 36 </p><p>STUDENTS STUDYING AT NARROW WOODEN TABLES.  THEY HAD SMALL </p><p>PAPERBACK BOOKLETS FOR MATH AND READING, AS WELL AS SMALL </p><p>TABLETS AND PENCILS. </p><p> </p><p>11. COMMENT:  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NAM DINH PROVINCE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IS MORE OPEN AND ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE </p><p>THAN MANY OF VIETNAM\'S PROVINCES.  AM, THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE CHAIR, SEEMED TO BE ON TOP OF HIS BRIEF AND AWARE </p><p>OF THE CHALLENGES FACING HIS PROVINCE.  AS ARTICULATED BY </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR, THE TRUE CHALLENGE IS EXERCISING LEADERSHIP </p><p>TO ESTABLISH FAVORABLE CONDITIONS TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT AND </p><p>LEAD TO BROADER PROSPERITY IN THE PROVINCE.  THUS FAR, THE </p><p>PALTRY NUMBER OF LOCAL JOBS CREATED AT THE PROVINCE\'S HUGE </p><p>TEXTILE FACTORY DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR SPURRING ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH IN THE PROVINCE.  VARIOUS NGO\'S, SUCH AS SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN AND ADRA, PERFORM VALUABLE SERVICE IN HELPING MEET </p><p>IMPORTANT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT NEEDS LEFT UNMET BY LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00864  03 OF 03  251113Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
