REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00903  01 OF 03  051245Z </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) IN HIS FIRST-EVER BRIEFING FOR THE HEADS OF </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAID ZIMBABWE IS IN A STATE OF </p><p>"TERMINAL PARALYSIS" DUE TO THE BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW AND INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ABUSES.  TSVANGIRAI URGED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO </p><p>ENGAGE CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>PRESSING IT TO REVERSE COURSE, NOT IMPOSE SANCTIONS, WHICH </p><p>WOULD HURT ONLY ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS.  IN THIS CONNECTION, </p><p>THE MDC PRESIDENT WAS CAREFUL TO NOTE HIS PARTY DID NOT </p><p>CONSIDER CONGRESS\'S ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY BILL TO BE SANCTIONS </p><p>LEGISLATION, BUT RATHER AN INCENTIVE TO GOOD GOZ BEHAVIOR. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI EMPHASIZED THE MDC\'S COMMITMENT TO EQUITABLE, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>LAWFUL LAND REFORM THAT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES </p><p>IDENTIFIED BY THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE ON LAND. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CALL AN EARLY ELECTION, BUT MASS ACTION WOULD BE </p><p>APPROPRIATE ONLY IF MUGABE STEALS THE ELECTION OR FINDS AN </p><p>EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD IT.  THE MDC IS MORE COHESIVE THAN IT </p><p>WAS LAST JUNE AND IS REGAINING SOME POLITICAL MOMENTUM. </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS FOCUSING BOTH ON WINNING THE </p><p>ELECTION AND ON DEVISING THE POLICIES IT WOULD IMPLEMENT IF </p><p>IT WINS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BRIEFED HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00903  01 OF 03  051245Z </p><p>MARCH 2 ON THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S POSITION ON RECENT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SEKAI HOLLAND, THE </p><p>PARTY\'S SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  CHARGE AND </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF WERE IN ATTENDANCE.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>SPOKE FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES, THEN TOOK QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) TSVANGIRAI EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT ZIMBABWE IS IN A </p><p>STATE OF "TERMINAL PARALYSIS," DUE TO SEVERAL CRITICAL </p><p>FACTORS.  FIRST WAS THE "ALARMING" BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW, EVIDENCED BY THE EMASCULATION OF THE POLICE AND WAR </p><p>VETERANS WREAKING HAVOC WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY.  THE </p><p>ESCALATING ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY ARE PARTICULARLY </p><p>DISTURBING, AS THE EXECUTION OF JUSTICE IS COMPROMISED IF </p><p>NOT EVEN JUDGES ARE SAFE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE SECOND CRITICAL FACTOR WAS THE INCREASE IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>ARMY, FOR INSTANCE, HAVE BEEN SENT INTO TOWNSHIPS TO BEAT </p><p>PEOPLE INDISCRIMINATELY, WITHOUT CAUSE OR PROVOCATION.  THE </p><p>MDC LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO BE HARASSED, SUBJECTED BOTH TO </p><p>"FLIMSY" CHARGES UNDER AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW (NB: THE LAW </p><p>AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT) ENACTED BY IAN SMITH TO WIELD </p><p>AGAINST AFRICAN NATIONALISTS, AND PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION, </p><p>EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT BEATINGS OF TWO MDC MPS.  THE GOZ </p><p>IS TRYING TO MUZZLE THE INDEPENDENT PRESS, INDICATED BY THE </p><p>BOMBING OF THE DAILY NEWS PRINTING PRESS, THE RELUCTANCE TO </p><p>ISSUE OPERATING LICENSES TO PRIVATE RADIO BROADCASTERS, AND </p><p>THE ILLEGAL DEPORTATION OF FOREIGN JOURNALISTS.  THE MDC\'S </p><p>37 ELECTORAL CHALLENGES WERE PROCEEDING IN THE HIGH COURT - </p><p>- THREE HAVE BEEN HEARD SO FAR -- AND WERE SHINING THE </p><p>SPOTLIGHT ON THE SERIOUS ABUSES WHICH HAD OCCURRED DURING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00903  01 OF 03  051245Z </p><p>LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  A COURT DECISION TO </p><p>SET ASIDE THE RESULTS IN SOME OF THE CONSTITUENCIES, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI OBSERVED, WOULD CHANGE THE EQUATION IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW AND TERRIBLE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IS THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CAPACITY TO RUN THE COUNTRY\'S AFFAIRS. THE </p><p>THIRD CRITICAL FACTOR WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ECONOMY, </p><p>WHICH TSVANGIRAI PREDICTED COULD NOT LAST ANOTHER FIVE </p><p>MONTHS UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, TSVANGIRAI SAID, NOW </p><p>HAS TWO OPTIONS.  IT COULD CONTINUE ON ITS CURRENT </p><p>REPRESSIVE PATH, WHICH WOULD LEAD INEVITABLY TO ITS OWN </p><p>DOWNFALL, OR IT COULD REVERSE COURSE.  THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN CONVINCING THE </p><p>MUGABE GOVERNMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  THE MOST </p><p>EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR OTHER NATIONS IS CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, NOT THE IMPOSITION </p><p>OF SANCTIONS, A STEP WHICH THE MDC DOES NOT ADVOCATE. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI NOTED RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA) MIGHT BE REVIVED SOON BY THE U.S. </p><p>CONGRESS.  THE MDC, HE SAID, DOES NOT CONSIDER THE ZDA A </p><p>SANCTIONS BILL BUT AN "INCENTIVE" TO PERSUADE THE GOZ TO </p><p>REVERSE ITS DAMAGING POLICIES.

(U) TSVANGIRAI REJECTED CRITICISM THAT THE MDC DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE A POLICY ON LAND.  HE INSISTED THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY IS COMMITTED TO EQUITABLE, LAWFUL LAND REFORM THAT </p><p>WILL GUARANTEE FOOD SECURITY AND PROTECT THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC BASE.  THE MDC OBJECTS TO THE METHODOLOGY OF THE </p><p>FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PLAN, WHICH HE CALLED "RUINOUS." </p><p>THE PARTY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THAT ANY LAND REFORM POLICY </p><p>MUST BE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES ENDORSED AT THE 1998 DONORS </p><p>CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>Q\'S AND A\'S </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF VARIED QUESTIONS FROM </p><p>THE ASSEMBLED DIPLOMATS, TSVANGIRAI MADE THE FOLLOWING </p><p>POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) TSVANGIRAI THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>WILL CALL AN EARLY ELECTION.  HE THOUGHT THE STATE OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY -- AND ITS PROGNOSIS FOR RECOVERY -- WOULD BE AN </p><p>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE PRESIDENT IN MAKING THIS </p><p>CALL.  ASKED WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAD CHARGED HIM RECENTLY </p><p>WITH INCITING VIOLENCE, THE MDC PRESIDENT SAID THE GOZ </p><p>ACTION CONSTITUTED "PURE HARASSMENT," AND THAT IT HAD BEEN </p><p>HOLDING THE POTENTIAL CHARGE OVER HIS HEAD FOR ALMOST SIX </p><p>MONTHS.  IF CONVICTED, HE WOULD BE SENTENCED TO A MINIMUM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00903  02 OF 03  051246Z </p><p>OF SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RUN FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT.  HE WOULD APPEAL A CONVICTION TO THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT, BUT FELT CONFIDENT THAT THE HIGH COURT WOULD DISMISS </p><p>THE CHARGE, AS SECTIONS OF THE LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE </p><p>ACT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE </p><p>LOMA, HE POINTED OUT, IS BEING APPLIED SELECTIVELY, AS </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS IN HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE MUCH MORE "TREASONABLE" STATEMENTS. </p><p>SEKAI HOLLAND INTERJECTED THAT THE ARREST OR CONVICTION OF </p><p>TSVANGIRAI COULD BE THE SPARK THAT SENDS ANGRY ZIMBABWEANS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTO THE STREETS IN PROTEST, AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS WELL </p><p>AWARE OF THAT POSSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI, THE MDC HAS POSTPONED MASS </p><p>ACTION, AS NOW IS NOT THE "RIGHT TIME."  THAT ASSESSMENT </p><p>MIGHT CHANGE, HOWEVER, IF THE GOVERNMENT STEALS THE </p><p>ELECTION OR AVOIDS HOLDING ONE BY DECLARING A STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW CONSTITUTION? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) TSVANGIRAI EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION, BUT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>ACCOMPLISH IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.  HE COMPARED THE </p><p>DILEMMA TO THE CHICKEN AND EGG CONUNDRUM, ASKING </p><p>RHETORICALLY WHETHER IT MADE MORE SENSE TO PUT A NEW BULB </p><p>IN A DEFECTIVE LAMP, OR TO REPLACE THE LAMP.  HE THOUGHT </p><p>THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED WAS FIRST TO REPLACE THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH ONE WILLING TO ALLOW A CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>CONSTITUTION-DRAFTING PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00903  02 OF 03  051246Z </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) TSVANGIRAI\'S RECENT MEETINGS IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH </p><p>ANC OFFICIALS REPRESENTED A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE OF ATTITUDE </p><p>FROM THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT.  THE DISCUSSIONS HAD </p><p>PRODUCED A COMMON UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ANC-MDC DIALOGUE </p><p>SHOULD BE CONTINUED AT ALL LEVELS.  "IT IS NOT TRUE THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI CONDONES WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ZIMBABWE," HE </p><p>STATED. </p><p> </p><p>SANCTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) ASKED TO CLARIFY HIS STATED OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GOZ, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>PROVIDED TWO REASONS.  SANCTIONS WOULD HURT ORDINARY </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, NOT THE MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT AT WHOM THEY </p><p>WOULD BE TARGETED, AND THEY WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO </p><p>REVERSE, EVEN AFTER AN MDC GOVERNMENT CAME INTO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>MDC THEN AND NOW </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1713 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00903  03 OF 03  051246Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CDADC1  051246Z /38 </p><p>P 051243Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8345 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000903 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 03/01/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  TSVANGIRAI BRIEFS HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS </p><p> </p><p>13.

HE SAID IT </p><p>WAS NATURAL THAT THE MDC WOULD FACE SOME INTERNAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>GIVEN THE BROAD-BASED NATURE OF THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE BELIEVED THE PARTY WAS NOW MORE COHESIVE AND </p><p>WAS BEGINNING TO REGAIN MOMENTUM AS IT PREPARED FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE MDC\'S PRIMARY FOCUS IS WINNING </p><p>THE ELECTION, BUT THE PARTY IS ALSO PUTTING IN PLACE ITS </p><p>PLAN FOR GOVERNING.  THE MDC\'S PRIORITIES UPON TAKING </p><p>OFFICE WOULD BE RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW, REVITALIZING THE </p><p>ECONOMY, PUTTING THE LAND QUESTION BACK ON A "SANER PATH," </p><p>AND REENGAGING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) TSVANGIRAI APPEARED CONFIDENT AND RELAXED, AND HE </p><p>HANDLED WITH EASE AND HUMOR THE MANY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS </p><p>ASKED OF HIM.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>HAS BRIEFED A GATHERING OF HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, </p><p>BUT HE INTENDS THE MARCH 2 SESSION TO BE THE FIRST </p><p>INSTALLMENT IN A REGULAR SERIES OF SUCH GATHERINGS. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SEEMS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS IN THE MDC\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTEREST TO STEP UP ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY AS MUGABE\'S GOVERNMENT BECOMES </p><p>INCREASINGLY ISOLATED.  HE ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT, AS THE ZIMBABWEAN FIGURE MOST LIKELY TO WIN A FREE </p><p>AND FAIR ELECTION, HE SHOULD WEIGH IN WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S REACHING OUT TO THE HEADS OF MISSION IS A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THAT SUGGESTS HE IS MATURING AS A </p><p>POLITICIAN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00903  03 OF 03  051246Z </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
