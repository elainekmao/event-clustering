<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 003313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/ERA, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/05/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, EU, IT, ITPREL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI VIEWS ON FUTURE OF EU; PREPARATIONS FOR </p><p>PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM MARGARET DEAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03313  01 OF 02  051553Z </p><p> 1.  (C)  SUMMARY: ON JULY 3, THE CHIEF OF THE MFA\'S OFFICE </p><p>FOR EU INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, GUISEPPE BUCCINO, EXPRESSED TO </p><p>POLOFF HIS CONCERNS ABOUT PROGRESS, OR THE LACK THEREOF, ON </p><p>CRITICAL EU INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.  HE IS STILL HOPEFUL THAT </p><p>THE CONVENTION DOCUMENT CAN BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN PRESIDENCY IN DECEMBER 2003.  THE GOI WILL ESTABLISH </p><p>TWO NEW OFFICES IN THE MFA TO DEAL WITH ITS PRESIDENCY </p><p>ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  BUCCINO BEGAN WITH THE ISSUE THAT, IN HIS VIEW, </p><p>COULD DERAIL ENLARGEMENT AND EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN EU </p><p>INSTITUTIONS; THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POSITION (CAP), </p><p>SPECIFICALLY DIRECT FARM SUBSIDIES TO FARMERS FROM NEWLY </p><p>ADMITTED STATES.  THE SEVILLE COUNCIL AND JUNE 10 GAC HAD </p><p>FAILED TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THIS ISSUE, A "HEADS IN THE </p><p>SAND" ATTITUDE AMONG EU LEADERS THAT WORRIES BUCCINO. </p><p>WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE GERMAN ELECTIONS TO DEAL WITH CAP IS </p><p>"CUTTING IT TOO CLOSE" TO THE END OF THE DANISH PRESIDENCY, </p><p>AND RISKS PUSHING OFF A SOLUTION UNTIL THE GREEK PRESIDENCY </p><p>IN 2004, A DEVELOPMENT WHICH BUCCINO FEELS COULD JEOPARDIZE </p><p>THE SCHEDULES FOR ENLARGEMENT AND THE CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ASIDE FROM SPECIFIC PAYMENT SCHEDULES, THERE WERE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES TO DEAL WITH.  GERMANY WOULD BE UNLIKELY </p><p>TO ACCEPT ANY SOLUTION THAT REQUIRED ADDITIONAL </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS, WHILE THE FRENCH VIEW DIRECT PAYMENTS AS PART </p><p>OF THE ACQUI.   BUCCINO HOPED THAT A COMPROMISE COULD BE </p><p>REACHED WHICH WOULD START PAYMENTS TO FARMERS FROM NEW MEMBER </p><p>STATES AT 10-20 PERCENT OF THOSE IN CURRENT MEMBERS, RISING </p><p>TO 100 PERCENT IN 2013.  THIS SCHEDULE WOULD BE CONCOMITANT </p><p>WITH GENERAL CAP REFORM AND REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS THROUGHOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03313  01 OF 02  051553Z </p><p>THE EU.  IN ANY CASE, BUCCINO SAID THE EU NEEDS TO START </p><p>TALKING ABOUT THE DETAILS RIGHT AFTER THE SUMMER BREAK, NOT </p><p>WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING THE SECOND ATTEMPT AT A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IRISH REFERENDUM ON THE NICE TREATY THIS AUTUMN </p><p>WERE ALSO TROUBLING BUCCINO.   HE SAID THAT IRISH AND OTHER </p><p>EU LEADERS WERE TOO CONFIDENT IN A POSITIVE OUTCOME, AND HE </p><p>IS "ASTONISHED" BY THE LACK OF ORGANIZATION BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF IRELAND TO EDUCATE AND GET THE WORD OUT ON THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF NICE TO THE FUTURE OF EUROPE.  IF THERE WERE ANOTHER "NO" </p><p>VOTE IN IRELAND, IT WOULD SEND A "POLITICAL SHOCK" THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE EU FROM WHICH THE ORGANIZATION MAY NEVER RECOVER.  THE </p><p>IRISH GOVERNMENT MUST EXPLAIN TO ITS PEOPLE THAT THERE IS </p><p>MORE AT STAKE IN NICE THAN ECONOMIC ISSUES.  THE FUTURE OF A </p><p>"NEW EUROPE," WORKING AS AN EQUAL WITH THE U.S. TO INFLUENCE </p><p>GLOBAL EVENTS AND DECISIONS, WAS ON THE LINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GETTING THE EU MEMBER STATES TO AGREE ON THE LIST OF </p><p>REFORMS IN THE NICE TREATY WAS A "PAINFUL" PROCESS, CONTINUED </p><p>BUCCINO.  REOPENING NICE, OR ATTEMPTING TO INCORPORATE ITS </p><p>KEY ELEMENTS IN THE CONVENTION DOCUMENT, WOULD REQUIRE A MUCH </p><p>LONGER TIMEFRAME THAN ORIGINALLY PROJECTED FOR INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFORM.  CERTAINLY, REOPENING NICE WOULD MEAN THAT THE </p><p>CONVENTION DOCUMENT COULD NOT BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN PRESIDENCY ON 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  BUCCINO WAS A BIT MORE OPTIMISTIC THAT A COMPROMISE </p><p>COULD BE FOUND ON GREEK/TURKISH DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING ESDP </p><p>AND CYPRUS.  HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO REACH A </p><p>COMPROMISE WHERE THE GREEK PORTION OF CYPRUS WAS ADMITTED IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03313  01 OF 02  051553Z </p><p>THE NEXT ROUND OF ENLARGEMENT, BUT THE EU WILL HAVE TO "THINK </p><p>CREATIVELY, AND QUICKLY" ABOUT CONCESSIONS TO TURKEY.  THE </p><p>COMMISSION\'S PROPOSAL FOR AN ENHANCED AID AND FINANCIAL </p><p>PACKAGE, COUPLED WITH "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES," WOULD </p><p>NOT BE ENOUGH, SAID BUCCINO.  TURKEY WILL WANT A DATE FOR </p><p>ACCESSION, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CLEARLY NOWHERE NEAR THE </p><p>COPENHAGEN CRITERIA.  BUCCINO THOUGHT A COMPROMISE COULD BE </p><p>REACHED WHEREBY THE COUNCIL APPROVES STRONGER LANGUAGE </p><p>CALLING FOR TURKISH ACCESSION, BUT WITHOUT A SPECIFIC DATE </p><p>FOR ENTRY INTO THE EU.  BUCCINO AVERRED THAT ESDP ISSUES </p><p>WOULD FALL INTO PLACE ONCE A CYPRUS ACCESSION AGREEMENT WAS </p><p>HAMMERED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BUCCINO\'S VIEW IS THAT TURKEY WOULD HAVE CONTINUING </p><p>PROBLEMS JOINING THE EU DUE TO CURRENT MEMBER STATES\' </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS ON THE ORGANIZATION\'S ROOTS, WHAT IT MEANS </p><p>TO BE "EUROPEAN," AND EUROPE\'S CULTURE (BASED ON GREEK, </p><p>LATIN, AND ESPECIALLY CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHIES).  BUCCINO </p><p>THOUGHT THAT MEMBER STATES MUST BEGIN TO VIEW THE EU MORE </p><p>LIKE THE ROMAN EMPIRE, IN WHICH ALL WERE CONSIDERED PART OF </p><p>THE EMPIRE, DESPITE GEOGRAPHIC, CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS, LANGUAGE </p><p>DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  BUCCINO SAID THAT THE GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG MEMBER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7490 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03313  02 OF 02  051554Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------C71287  051554Z /38 </p><p>P 051605Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4651 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/ERA, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/05/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI VIEWS ON FUTURE OF EU; PREPARATIONS FOR </p><p>PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>STATES OVER THE NEED FOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM WAS </p><p>ENCOURAGING.  THERE MUST BE AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03313  02 OF 02  051554Z </p><p>NUMBER OF COUNCILS.  THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION IS </p><p>COMPROMISED WHEN IT IS NOT DISCUSSED ACROSS THE BOARD, AND </p><p>THEREFORE A NEW "COUNCIL FOR LEGISLATION" WAS NEEDED, WITH </p><p>OTHER, STREAMLINED COUNCILS ACTING AS "ADVISORY COMMITTEES." </p><p>THE SIX-MONTH ROTATIONAL PRESIDENCY ALSO HAD TO GO, BUCCINO </p><p>EMPHASIZED.  THE CURRENT SYSTEM HAD OBVIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECTS </p><p>ON CONTINUITY, AND WAS AT ODDS EVEN WITH SOME OF THE EU\'S OWN </p><p>PROCEDURES.  FOR INSTANCE, THE TWELVE-MONTH BUDGET PROCEDURE </p><p>SHOULD HAVE OVERSIGHT BY SINGLE PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  BUCCINO SAID THE CONVENTION WAS PROGRESSING </p><p>STEADILY, BUT SLOWLY, AND HE WAS CONCERNED THAT DEBATE ON </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, SUCH AS LIMITATION OF </p><p>COMPETENCIES, COUNCIL PRESIDENT SELECTION, THE POWERS OF </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER EU BODIES, </p><p>HAD YET TO BE ADDRESSED.  THE CONVENTION\'S GOAL WAS TO </p><p>PRODUCE A DOCUMENT OF NO MORE THAN 140 ARTICLES WITH 2-3 </p><p>ANNEXES TO PRESENT TO THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL COUNCIL IGC), </p><p>CONTAINING, INTER ALIA, A HUMAN RIGHTS CHARTER, DEFINITION OF </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, INSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCIES, AND LEGAL PRESENCE </p><p>OF THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  BUCCINO WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE DOCUMENT COULD BE </p><p>COMPLETED BY THE JUNE 2003 COUNCIL.  THE IGC WOULD THEN BEGIN </p><p>AFTER A SHORT "COOLING OFF" PERIOD.  IF THE QUALITY OF THE </p><p>DOCUMENT WAS HIGH, AND THERE WERE NO AMBIGUOUS AREAS, IT </p><p>WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2003.  IF THE DOCUMENT HAD "OPEN QUESTIONS" LEFT FOR </p><p>THE IGC TO SOLVE, MEMBER STATES WOULD LOOK FOR COMPROMISES </p><p>WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY WEAKEN THE UNION AND DELAY REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03313  02 OF 02  051554Z </p><p>11.  (C)  THE GOI HAS, UNCHARACTERISTICALLY, STARTED EARLY </p><p>PLANNING FOR ITS PRESIDENCY IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2003. </p><p>ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, PM BERLUSCONI HAS DECIDED THAT IN </p><p>KEEPING WITH THE NICE TREATY, BOTH EUROPEAN COUNCILS DURING </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WILL BE HELD IN BRUSSELS.  TWO OFFICES </p><p>IN THE MFA WOULD BE ESTABLISHED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2002 TO </p><p>HANDLE PRESIDENCY ISSUES.  ONE WOULD BE A "PROTOCOL" OFFICE </p><p>HEADED BY LEONARDO VISCONTE DI MADRONE, ASSISTED BY 2 OR 3 </p><p>DIPLOMATS PLUS A SUPPORT STRUCTURE.  THIS OFFICE WOULD BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING MEETINGS (INCLUDING U.S./EU </p><p>MEETINGS) AND COMMUNICATING WITH MEMBER STATES AND OTHER </p><p>INTERESTED PARTIES ON UPCOMING EVENTS.  THIS WILL BE A </p><p>"TERRIBLE JOB," ADMITTED BUCCINO, GIVEN THE ITALIAN </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC PREDILECTION TO DELAY DECISIONS TO THE LAST </p><p>MINUTE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU)  THE OTHER OFFICE WOULD BE CHARGED WITH PRODUCING </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE DOCUMENTS, HORIZONTAL COORDINATION OF POSITIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE GOI, AND COORDINATING COREPER ACTIVITIES.  THE </p><p>OFFICE WILL BE HEADED BY VINCENZO GRASSI. </p><p> </p><p>BIOGRAPHIC SKETCHES OF VISCONTI DI MADRONE AND GRASSI FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>LEONARDO VISCONTI DI MODRONE:  BORN IN MILAN IN 1947. </p><p>GRADUATED FROM MILAN\'S PRIVATE AND PRESTIGIOUS BOCCONI </p><p>UNIVERSITY IN 1970, IN ECONOMICS.
