<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT\'S LATEST REFORM PACKAGE - SCORECARD AND </p><p>ANALYSIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8586 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7290 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 6116 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 8569 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The GOT has prepared extensive legislative </p><p>reforms designed to crack down on torture and remove barriers </p><p>to free expression, association, and fair trial.  Parliament </p><p>will likely pass the reforms quickly, possibly before or </p><p>during the December 12-13 EU Summit in Copenhagen.  The </p><p>reforms will bring Turkey significantly closer to meeting EU </p><p>membership criteria.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The new GOT administration has completed its list of </p><p>proposed legislative reforms; during Cabinet review the </p><p>original 36-article draft (Reftel A) was broken into two </p><p>packages, with a few controversial measures separated from </p><p>the rest.  The parliamentary Constitutional and Justice </p><p>committees will review the packages December 10 and the full </p><p>Parliament is scheduled to take them up December 11.  GOT </p><p>officials say they expect both packages to be approved in </p><p>December, and hope the first can be passed before or during </p><p>the December 12-13 EU Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The following is a summary and analysis of the key </p><p>elements of the two packages: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>FIRST PACKAGE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Torture: In torture cases, judges will not have the </p><p>authority to suspend sentences or convert prison sentences to </p><p>fines.  In cases where a civil servant is accused of torture, </p><p>it will no longer be necessary to receive permission from the </p><p>civil servant\'s supervisor in order to investigate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Eliminates two important elements of the climate </p><p>of impunity for torturers and sends a very strong signal that </p><p>the GOT is getting serious about the problem.  In current </p><p>practice, it is extremely difficult to investigate police </p><p>accused of torture, and even when police are tried and </p><p>convicted they rarely do jail time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Non-Muslim Foundations: Non-Muslim foundations will be </p><p>able to acquire property with the permission of the General </p><p>Directorate of Foundations.  Currently, foundations must </p><p>receive permission from the Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Addresses one of the shortcomings of the recent </p><p>legislation on non-Muslim foundations, but not others.  For </p><p>example, existing regulations appear to apply only to the </p><p>minority groups traditionally recognized under the Lausanne </p><p>Treaty -- Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jews (Reftel </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Press: It will not be possible to force the owners of </p><p>media outlets to disclose news sources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: The amendment refers to "owners," and it is </p><p>unclear how broadly it would be applied.  A human rights </p><p>attorney told poloff he believed it would also cover </p><p>reporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Parliamentary/Political Party Eligibility: The list of </p><p>criminal convictions rendering someone ineligible to be </p><p>elected to Parliament or join a political party will be </p><p>shortened.  Most importantly, convictions under Penal Code </p><p>Article 312, relating to illegal speech, will no longer </p><p>constitute an ineligibility.  Persons will generally be </p><p>ineligible to join a political party if they have been </p><p>sentenced to five or more years imprisonment, up from the </p><p>current standard of more than three years.  Anyone convicted </p><p>of committing "terrorist acts" will be barred from Parliament </p><p>and political parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Article 312 is one of the measures most commonly </p><p>used by the State to limit free expression and keep </p><p>"threatening" figures (Islamists, leftists, Kurdish </p><p>activists) out of politics.  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of </p><p>the ruling AK Party, is currently prevented from assuming the </p><p>title of Prime Minister because of a 312 conviction.  One </p><p>flaw in this amendment: there is no definition of "terrorist </p><p>acts," a charge that has been applied broadly to include such </p><p>acts as chanting slogans in Kurdish or demanding education in </p><p>Kurdish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Party Closure: A three-fifths majority of the </p><p>11-member Constitutional Court will be required to close a </p><p>political party; the law currently requires only a simple </p><p>majority.  Also, it will be possible to close parties only </p><p>for reasons stated in the Constitution; current law also </p><p>allows for closure under the more extensive reasons cited in </p><p>the Political Parties Law.  While the wording of the </p><p>Constitution is designed to outlaw party activities that </p><p>threaten the "independence and territorial integrity of the </p><p>State," the Political Parties Law cites a long list of </p><p>specific prohibitions, for example against parties that "rest </p><p>on the foundation of region," "engage in activities abroad," </p><p>or use languages other than Turkish. Parties will have the </p><p>right to appeal closure rulings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Closure, or the threat of closure, has been used </p><p>repeatedly against Islamist and pro-Kurdish parties, and some </p><p>of the measures have been approved by a simple 6-5 majority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Associations: A number of restrictions on </p><p>associations will be removed.  It will be possible to create </p><p>associations for any purpose not in violation of the </p><p>Constitution or laws pertaining to national security, public </p><p>health and order, and the liberty of others.  Current law </p><p>includes a list of specific purposes for which associations </p><p>cannot be created.  Associations will be required to use the </p><p>Turkish language only in written communication with official </p><p>GOT institutions; currently they are required to use Turkish </p><p>for all communication.  Associations will no longer be </p><p>required to notify a local government official 24 hours in </p><p>advance of releasing a statement.  Turkish associations will </p><p>have more freedom to establish branches abroad and interact </p><p>with international associations, and international </p><p>associations will have more freedom to operate in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Eliminates a series of highly restrictive </p><p>measures that have been used to restrict the free expression </p><p>of various groups.  The current notification requirement for </p><p>statements serves as a form of censorship -- local officials </p><p>often ban statements before they are released.  These </p><p>restrictions have damaged Turkey\'s international image, </p><p>particularly due to their impact in foreign organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Attorney Access: Suspects charged in State Security </p><p>Courts, which generally handle terrorist and separatist </p><p>cases, will have the right to immediate attorney access. </p><p>Currently they are entitled to see an attorney after 48 </p><p>hours.  Suspects accused of ordinary crimes are already </p><p>allowed immediate attorney access. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>SECOND PACKAGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Retrial Pursuant to ECHR Rulings: Defendants </p><p>convicted in Turkish courts will be able to apply for a </p><p>retrial if the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) </p><p>rules/has ruled in their favor.  This amendment will apply to </p><p>cases in which the ECHR has ruled prior to the passage of the </p><p>legislation, as well as to cases brought to the ECHR </p><p>following passage.  However, it will not apply to cases under </p><p>ECHR review at the time of passage.  A more limited measure </p><p>passed in August (Reftel C) applies only to cases brought to </p><p>the ECHR starting in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis:  The EU\'s Copenhagen Political Criteria require </p><p>Turkey to address the issue of prisoners currently jailed for </p><p>non-violent political activity, something the August </p><p>amendment failed to do.  Thus, this measure removes one of </p><p>the more substantial arguments against Turkey\'s EU candidacy. </p><p> This opens the door to a retrial in the high-profile case of </p><p>Leyla Zana, former parliamentarian from the pro-Kurdish DEP </p><p>Party, as well as an estimated 300 other current prisoners. </p><p>The dubious exception for cases currently under ECHR review </p><p>is designed to prevent jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan from </p><p>seeking a retrial.  This legal sleight of hand is unlikely to </p><p>draw much protest from the EU -- local European diplomats </p><p>tell us their governments do not want to see a new trial for </p><p>Ocalan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Student Suspensions:  Students suspended from </p><p>universities for wearing Islamic head covering or for </p><p>demanding education in Kurdish will have their suspensions </p><p>erased and their disciplinary records annulled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: The new GOT has generally been downplaying </p><p>Islamic issues to avoid alarming those concerned about AK </p><p>Party\'s perceived Islamist roots.  Combining the headscarf </p><p>issue with Kurdish language rights is a smart move -- it </p><p>places the headscarf controversy in a broader context and may </p><p>win points with a Kurdish community generally suspicious that </p><p>AK will focus exclusively on Islamic rights at their expense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT - WHAT\'S MISSING? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The AK Government has done everything possible, given </p><p>the short period since it took power Nov. 18, to carry out </p><p>human rights reform and enhance Turkey\'s EU prospects at </p><p>Copenhagen.  AK has also indicated a desire to tackle more </p><p>deeply rooted obstacles to reform, which will require far </p><p>more than legislation.  AK leaders are now trying to build a </p><p>broad consensus in favor of dismantling and reforming the </p><p>restrictive State apparatus that has been a focal point of EU </p><p>and western criticism.  In pursuing this agenda, AK is likely </p><p>to draw substantial support from a Turkish public eager for </p><p>change.  Nevertheless, it will face stiff resistance from </p><p>bureaucratic and other elements of the State interested in </p><p>maintaining the status quo -- and their privileged place in </p><p>it.  The key obstacles that need to be addressed are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Redrafting Laws: The GOT packages are informed by a </p><p>constitution, written under the direction of the military </p><p>after the 1980 coup, that has been an obstacle to </p><p>democratization.  PM Gul has announced his Government\'s </p><p>desire to draft a new, more flexible and open constitution. </p><p>However, AK will have to be careful to avoid charges that it </p><p>is "undermining Kemalism" -- explicitly prohibited by the </p><p>current constitutional framework -- or promoting </p><p>"reactionary" Islam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Southeast: The GOT has lifted the state of emergency </p><p>in the southeast, but has no "post war" plan for developing </p><p>the region (Reftel D).  The EU\'s Copenhagen Criteria require </p><p>Turkey to develop such a plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Civil-Military Relations: The GOT has increased the number </p><p>of civilian members of the National Security Council, but the </p><p>military still plays an often dominant role in government, a </p><p>fact often cited by European diplomats skeptical of Turkey\'s </p><p>EU candidacy (septel).  The Copenhagen Criteria specify the </p><p>need to limit the NSC to its formal, advisory role. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
