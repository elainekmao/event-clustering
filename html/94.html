THE GOI HAS LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE PUBLICITY </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO DOCUMENT THE GOALS AND METHODS OF THE </p><p>PLO.  MFA SOURCES HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A PAPER ON </p><p>"THE PLO\'S OUTLOOK AND GOALS IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT" WHICH IS BEING MADE PUBLIC </p><p>AS PART OF THAT CAMPAIGN.  THE TEXT IS BELOW IN PARA </p><p>2.

BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>"CHAPTER 1:  THE POLITICAL DIMENSION - THE PLO\'S </p><p>OUTLOOK AND GOALS IN THE WAKE OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT </p><p>AGREEMENT (11 FEB 1985) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT AND ITS MEANING AS </p><p>VIEWED BY THE PLO </p><p> </p><p>1.  ARAFAT SIGNED THE AGREEMENT WITH HUSSEIN FOR </p><p>THREE PRIMARY REASONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  TO ENSURE THAT HUSSEIN WOULD NOT ENTER INTO </p><p>SEPARATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL; </p><p> </p><p>B.  TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>A PLO PRESENCE IN JORDAN, FROM WHENCE THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION WAS EXPELLED IN 1970. </p><p> </p><p>C.  TO WIN US RECOGNITION, WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT </p><p>THE US\' PRECONDITIONS, NAMELY, ACCEPTING UN </p><p>RESOLUTION 242 AND RECOGNIZING ISRAEL\'S RIGHT TO </p><p>EXIST, AND TO ACHIEVE US AGREEMENT TO THE CONVENING </p><p>OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AT WHICH THE PLO WILL </p><p>HAVE A STATUS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE EXPULSION OF THE TERRORISTS FROM LEBANON, </p><p>INITIALLY BY THE IDF AND LATER BY SYRIA, BROUGHT THE </p><p>PLO TO ONE OF THE LOWEST POINTS IN ITS HISTORY; NOT </p><p>ONLY WERE PLO MEMBERS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST, BUT WHEN ARAFAT WANTED TO CONVENE THE PALESTINE </p><p>NATIONAL COUNCIL, HE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING AN </p><p>ARAB COUNTRY WILLING TO HOST IT AND, IN THE END, ONLY </p><p>JORDAN AGREED TO DO SO.  FOR ARAFAT, THE AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH HUSSEIN THEREFORE MEANS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE </p><p>RETURN OF THE TERRORISTS TO JORDAN AND THE GRADUAL </p><p>STRENGTHENING OF THEIR PRESENCE THERE, WITH THE </p><p>INTENTION BEING THAT JORDAN SERVE AS A BASE FOR </p><p>INCREASED TERRORIST ACTIVITY AGAINST ISRAELI TARGETS, </p><p>FOR THE INCITEMENT OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE </p><p>TERRITORIES AGAINST ISRAELI RULE, AND FOR THE </p><p>STRENGTHENING OF THE PLO\'S POSITION IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  IN HIS BOOK, \'THE JORDANIAN </p><p>AGREEMENT\', WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN AMMAN IN JULY </p><p>1985, KHALED AL-HASSAN, HEAD OF THE INFORMATION </p><p>DIVISION OF \'FATAH\', SPEAKS OF THIS GOAL: </p><p> </p><p>-   \'THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE RETURN OF THE </p><p>PLO TO AN AREA WHICH BORDERS ON THE HOMELAND, AND TO </p><p>AN ESCALATION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ONE OF </p><p>THE FIXED PRINCIPLES OF THE PALESTINIAN ACTION </p><p>STRATEGY.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE PLACE IS JORDAN, SINCE </p><p>THE BORDERS OF EGYPT, SYRIA, AND LEBANON HAVE BEEN </p><p>CLOSED FOR REASONS WHICH THERE IS NO NEED TO GO </p><p>INTO.  THE RETURN TO JORDAN IS A STRATEGIC INTEREST </p><p>AND NEED OF BOTH PALESTINE AND JORDAN.  THE RETURN TO </p><p>JORDAN NECESSITATES AN AGREEMENT TO ORDER RELATIONS </p><p>(BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES??)\'. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT CONTAINS NEITHER </p><p>CONCESSIONS NOR MODERATION ON BASIC PLO POSITIONS. </p><p>IN OTHER WORDS, THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM </p><p>PLO POLICY AS APPROVED BY THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTIONS - AND ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL - AND AS ENSHRINED IN THE </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE ARAB SUMMITS.  INDEED, A STATEMENT </p><p>WHICH THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ISSUED ON 18 </p><p>FEBRUARY 1985, AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT, </p><p>SAID THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-   \'THE JOINT ACTIVITY OF JORDAN AND THE PLO IS </p><p>BASED ON PALESTINIAN LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED </p><p>IN THE DECISIONS OF THE PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AT ITS 16TH AND 17TH SESSIONS, ON ARAB </p><p>LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN THE DECISIONS OF </p><p>THE ARAB SUMMITS, IN PARTICULAR RABAT AND FEZ, AND ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN THE </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE UN.\' </p><p> </p><p>SINCE THIS STATEMENT WAS PUBLISHED, SIMILAR DECISIONS </p><p>HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY A NUMBER OF PLO AND \'FATAH\' </p><p>INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY </p><p>CHANGE IN THE PLO\'S STRATEGIC AIM, WHICH REMAINS THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>\'DEMOCRATIC, SECULAR\' STATE ON ISRAEL\'S RUINS, WITH </p><p>THE ACHIEVING OF THIS AIM BEING CARRIED OUT IN </p><p>STAGES.  EVIDENCE FOR THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE </p><p>DECLARATIONS OF THE AL-HASSAN BROTHERS, CONFIDANTS OF </p><p>ARAFAT: </p><p> </p><p>A.  HANI AL-HASSAN, ARAFAT\'S POLITICAL ADVISOR:  \'AS </p><p>LONG AS THE PALESTINIAN DEMOCRATIC STATE HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>ESTABLISHED ON ALL OF PALESTINE, THERE CAN BE NO </p><p>ABSOLUTE AND FINAL SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PROBLEM.  I AM SPEAKING ALSO OF THOSE LANDS WHICH </p><p>WERE PALESTINIAN BEFORE 1948, FROM THE RIVER TO THE </p><p>SEA; THIS IS THE STRATEGIC GOAL.  CLEARLY, SUCH A </p><p>GOAL IS NOT ATTAINED ALL AT ONCE, BUT RATHER IN </p><p>STAGES.\' (AL-SAYAD, 15.4). </p><p> </p><p>B.  KHALED AL-HASSAN:  \'THE CONFLICT IS LONG AND </p><p>ALL-ENCOMPASSING, AND ITS OUTCOME WILL BE DETERMINED </p><p>ONLY BY THE ELIMINATION OF EITHER ARAB NATIONALISM, </p><p>OR ZIONISM.  THERE IS A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE </p><p>TWO MOVEMENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED THROUGH THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF ONE OF THEM.  HOWEVER, SINCE WE SEE NO </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF QUICKLY ACHIEVING THE FINAL AIM, WE </p><p>OPERATE THROUGH THE POLICY OF STAGES, UPON WHICH THE </p><p>PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL DECIDED IN 1974\' (AL-ANBA, </p><p>KUWAIT, 24.5). </p><p>-- </p><p>4.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT HAS PRODUCED NO </p><p>CHANGE IN THE PLO\'S VIEW OF TERROR, WHICH IT REFERS </p><p>TO S THE \'ARMED STRUGGLE\'.  FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>-   1.  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE ARMED STRUGGLE SOWS, </p><p>AND THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE REAPS, AND HE WHO SOWS </p><p>NOT, REAPS NOT\' (RADIO MONTE CARLO, 16.3). </p><p> </p><p>-   2.  NABIL SHA\'AT MEMBER OF THE \'FATAH\' CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE:  \'SOLELY POLITICAL SOLUTIONS CANNOT BE </p><p>SOUGHT WITHOUT CONTINUING ARMED STRUGGLE\' (ASH-SHARQ </p><p>AL-AWSAT, 18.8). </p><p> </p><p>B.  MOREOVER, THE \'ARMED STRUGGLE\' IS OF CENTRAL </p><p>IMPORTANCE; IT MUST BE CONTINUED, EVEN ESCALATED AS, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>-   1.  ABU JIHAD, HEAD OF THE MILITARY ARM OF </p><p>\'FATAH\' AND RESPONSIBLE FOR WEST BANK AFFAIRS:  \'THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF SEA WARFARE BY PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS IS AN </p><p>EXPRESSION OF THE FIRM DECISION TO CONTINUE AND </p><p>ESCALTE THIS ARMED STRUGGLE, WHATEVER THE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES MAY BE . . . POLITICAL ACTIVITY WAS </p><p>NEVER AN OBSTACLE TO THE CONTINUATION OF MILITARY </p><p>ACTIVITY, BUT RATHER A MEANS TO ADVANCE AND DEVELOP </p><p>IT\' (AL-ANBA, 24.2). </p><p> </p><p>-   2.  AHMAD ABD AL-RAHMAN, ARAFAT\'S SPOKESMAN: </p><p>\'THE REVOLUTIONARY MARCH WILL CONTINUE, DESPITE THE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, IN ORDER THAT THE ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE ADVANCE WITH RANKS UNIFIED, AS THE ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY WAY TO PALESTINE.  THERE IS NO </p><p>OTHER ROUTE TO PALESTINE EXCEPT FOR ARMED STRUGGLE\' </p><p>(FILASTIN ATH-THAWRA, 16.3). </p><p> </p><p>-   3.  THE FATAH \'REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\':  \'ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>STRUGGLE TO REALIZE NATIONAL GOALS.  ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>THIS STRUGGLE, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL HEREBY </p><p>DECIDES TO APPROVE THE PLAN, WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY </p><p>THE CENTRL COMMITTEE, TO ESCALATE THE ARMED STRUGGLE </p><p>IN THE OCCUPIED LAND\' (CONCLUDING STATEMENT AT THE </p><p>END OF DISCUSSIONS IN TUNIS, 6.4). </p><p> </p><p>-   4.  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE FUTURE WILL IN THE END </p><p>PROVE THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF CONTINUING THE ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE, BECAUSE IF WE ARE NOT, THAN NEITHER SHALL </p><p>WE BE SUITABLE CLAIMANTS TO REPRESENT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PEOPLE\' (ASH-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, 16.4). </p><p> </p><p>-   5.  ARAFAT:  \'THE MOST RECENT GUERILLA ACTION, </p><p>WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT OFF THE COAST OF PALESTINE </p><p>(SINKING OF THE ATAVARIUS ???) WAS NOT THE LAST, </p><p>RATHER IT CONSTITUTES THE BEGINNING OF A SERIES OF </p><p>ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH WILL HURT ISRAEL\' (AL-RAI </p><p>AL-\'AM, 25.4). </p><p> </p><p>-   6.  KHALED AL-HASSAN:  \'WHAT IS NEEDED TODAY IS A </p><p>CHANGE IN THE SCOPE AND CHARACTER OF MILITARY ACTION </p><p>INSIDE ISRAEL.  I AM NOT CALLING FOR SIMPLY ANOTHER </p><p>SUICIDE ACTION, RATHER, AN ACTION WHICH WILL HAVE A </p><p>VERY MAJOR IMPACT ON THE ENEMY FROM THE MATERIAL, </p><p>MORALE, ECONOMIC, AND SECURITY POINTS OF VIEW\' </p><p>(AL-ANBA, 12.6). </p><p> </p><p>-   7.  THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE OF \'FATAH\':  \'STEPS MUST BE TAKEN WHICH CAN </p><p>LEAD TO THE CREATION OF SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR THE </p><p>INTENSIFICATION OF THE PALESTINIAN ARMED STRUGGLE, IN </p><p>ALL ITS FORMS, IN THE OCCUPIED ARAB LANDS\' (DECISION </p><p>AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR MEETING, 23.9). </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE JORDANIANS, AND IN THEIR WAKE THE AMERICANS </p><p>AND EUROPEANS, INTERPRETED THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT </p><p>AGREEMENT AS A PLO CONCESSION ON SEVERAL CENTRAL </p><p>POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-   A.  ITS APPARENT ACCEPTANCE OF UN RESOLUTION 242. </p><p> </p><p>-   B.  ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF \'LAND FOR </p><p>PEACE\'. </p><p> </p><p>-   C.  ITS ABANDONING THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE. </p><p> </p><p>-   D.  ITS CONCEDING THE RIGHT TO SOLE </p><p>REPRESENTATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>THE PLO REJECTS THESE JORDANIAN INTERPRETATIONS AND </p><p>INSISTS THAT NO CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN ITS </p><p>POSITIONS ON THESE ISSUES.  FOLLOWING ARE THE CLAIMS </p><p>AND COUNTER-CLAIMS: </p><p> </p><p>-   A.  UN RESOLUTION 242 </p><p> </p><p>-        (1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT DETERMINES </p><p>IN SECTION 1:  \'LAND IN EXCHANGE FOR PEACE, AS CITED </p><p>IN THE UN RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS.\' </p><p> </p><p>-        (2)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN </p><p>ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE ON 31.5, KING HUSSEIN SAID: </p><p>\'THE PALESTINIANS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT UNITED </p><p>NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 242 AND </p><p>338 . . . AS A BASIS FOR A SETTLEMENT.\' </p><p> </p><p>-        (3)  HOWEVER, THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, </p><p>IN ITS APPROVING OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT </p><p>(18.2), REJECTED RESOLUTION 242. </p><p> </p><p>-        (4)  ARAFAT HIMSELF CONDITIONED THE </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF 242 ON AMERICAN RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS\' RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION (INTERVIEW </p><p>WITH THE \'WASHINGTON POST\', 15.5).  WHEN ASKED (BY A </p><p>CORRESPONDENT FROM THE \'WALL STREET JOURNAL\', 7.6), </p><p>TO REITERATE KING HUSSEIN\'S STATEMENTS ((2) ABOVE), </p><p>HE RESPONDED:  \'NO, NO I WON\'T REPEAT IT.  I\'M NOT A </p><p>MONKEY.  I GIVE MY OWN POLITICAL DECLARATIONS\'. </p><p> </p><p>-        (5)  THE PLO DOES NOT ACCEPT THE </p><p>ABOVE-MENTIONED CLAUSE OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT </p><p>AGREEMENT AS REFERRING EXPLICITLY TO 242, BUT RATHER </p><p>TO ALL UN AND SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS DEALING </p><p>WITH THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT, COLLECTIVELY.  THUS, </p><p>FOR INSTANCE, KHALED AL-HASSAN, SAID:  \'THE REJECTION </p><p>OF 242 AS THE ONLY BASIS FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>MOST DEFINITELY STILL EXISTS.  BUT RESOLUTION 242, </p><p>WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER WITH A SERIES OF OTHER DECISIONS, </p><p>IS NOT TO BE REJECTED . . . ALL THESE DECISIONS </p><p>TOGETHER MEAN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE, THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION, </p><p>RETURN OF THE REFUGEES, AND RECOGNITION OF THE PLO\' </p><p>(AL-ANB, 11.6). </p><p> </p><p>B.  \'LAND FOR PEACE\' </p><p> </p><p>(1)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE </p><p>INSTITUTE (19.3), TAHER AL-MASRI, THE JORDANIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER, SAID:  \'THE IMPORTANCE OF THE </p><p>JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENT IS THAT IT OBLIGATES, </p><p>PUBLICLY, THE PLO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF \'LAND FOR PEACE\'. </p><p> </p><p>(2)  HOWEVER, THE PLO\'S INTERPRETATION OF \'LAND FOR </p><p>PEACE\' IS DIFFERENT THAN THE JORDANIAN </p><p>INTERPRETATION.  ABU JIHAD SAID THE FOLLOWING IN </p><p>KUWAIT (18.5):  \'THE PLO\'S FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO </p><p>THE \'LAND FOR PEACE\' QUESTION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT </p><p>OF JORDAN\'. </p><p> </p><p>(3)  THE PLO DOES NOT SEE THE FORMULATION \'LAND FOR </p><p>PEACE\' AS SIGNIFYING AN EXCHANGE - MAKING PEACE WITH </p><p>ISRAEL IN RETURN FOR GETTING BACK THE TERRITORIES - </p><p>RATHER AS PART OF THE \'THEORY OF STAGES\', THAT IS TO </p><p>SY THE CREATION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE ON ALL LAND </p><p>FROM WHICH ISRAEL WITHDRAWS, AS A STEP TOWARD THE </p><p>CREATION OF A SECULAR-DEMOCRATIC-PALESTINIAN STATE ON </p><p>THE ENTIRE TERRITORY.  THE PLO VIEWS THE FORMULATION </p><p>\'LAND FOR PEACE\' AS PARALLELLING DECISIONS OF THE </p><p>PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE FEZ SUMMIT.  THUS, </p><p>ARAFAT SAID:  \'LAND FOR PEACE - ON THIS THERE IS ARAB </p><p>AGREEMENT AT FEZ\' (ROZ AL-YUSUF, 12.5).  KHALID AL </p><p>HASSAN SAID THE FOLLOWING:  \'EVERYONE WHO ACCEPTED </p><p>THE DECISIONS OF THE PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL, AND </p><p>THE THEORY OF STAGES, AND ALL WHO ACCEPTED THE FEZ </p><p>DECISIONS, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY BY THE PALESTINE </p><p>NATIONAL COUNCIL (PNC), CANNOT OPPOSE THE SENTENCE </p><p>\'LAND FOR PEACE\', AS AT ITS HEART IS THE \'THEORY OF </p><p>STAGES\'\' (AL-ANBA, 12.6). </p><p> </p><p>C.  AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE </p><p> </p><p>-- (1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT STATES (CLAUSE </p><p>3):  \'THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD EXERCISE THEIR </p><p>INALIABLE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION, WHEN THE </p><p>JORDANIANS AND PALESTINIANS MANAGE TO ACHIEVE THIS </p><p>WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ARAB CONFEDERATION THAT IS </p><p>INTENDED TO BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO STATES OF </p><p>JORDAN AND PALESTINE.\' </p><p> </p><p>-- (2)  THE JORDANIANS PRESENT THIS CONFEDERATION NOT </p><p>AS COMPRISING TWO INDEPENDENT STATES, RATHER AS A </p><p>FEDERATION HAVING ONE SOVEREIGN, ONE ARMY, AND ONE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WHICH IN FACT MEANS THE PLO\'S GIVING UP </p><p>THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE. </p><p> </p><p>-- (3)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE </p><p>INSTITUTE (19.3), JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TAHER </p><p>AL-MASRI SAID:  \'THE MEANING OF THE </p><p>JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENT IS THAT THE PLO NO </p><p>LONGER DEMANDS AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE\'. </p><p> </p><p>-- (4)  HOWEVER, THE PLO PRESENTS THE CONFEDERATION </p><p>AS BEING COMPOSED OF TWO INDEPENDENT STATES, WITH THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE HAVING TO COME INTO </p><p>BEING \'BEFORE\' THE ESTABLISIMENT OF THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION.  THUS, KHALED AL-HASSAN SAID:  \'THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION WILL BE BETWEEN TWO SOVEREIGN STATES. </p><p>A PALESTINIAN STATE WILL BE ESTABLISHED \'BEFORE\' THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION, EVEN IF THE CONFEDERATION IS </p><p>ESTABLISHED FIVE MINUTES AFTER INDEPENDENCE\' </p><p>(COTIDIENNE DE PARIS, 25.3). </p><p> </p><p>-- (5)  THE PLO LEADERS EMPHASIZE THAT IN ADDITION TO </p><p>THE AGREEMENT WITH JORDAN, HUSSEIN SENT A \'MEMORANDUM </p><p>OF CLARIFICATION\' ON 4.3, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE </p><p>\'PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\'S RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION </p><p>RESIDES IN A UNITED STATE OF PALESTINE HAVING A </p><p>CONFEDERAL CONNECTION TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF </p><p>JORDAN\'. </p><p> </p><p>-- (6)  THE JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER\'S DECLARATION </p><p>THAT THE PLO GAVE UP THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE (SEE ABOVE, (3)), WHICH HE REPEATED </p><p>AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON (5.6), DURING </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S VISIT TO THE US, PRODUCED ANGRY REACTIONS </p><p>FROM THE PLO: </p><p> </p><p>-   (A)  ABU IYAD:  \'ACCORDING TO THE KING\'S </p><p>DECISIONS, AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE MUST </p><p>FIRST BE DECLARED, AND ONLY AFTERWARDS WILL THE </p><p>CONFEDERATION WITH JORDAN BE ESTABLISHED\' (REUTER, </p><p>6.6). </p><p> </p><p>-   (B)  KADDOUMI:  \'THE PALESTINIANS MUST REALIZE </p><p>THEIR RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION, </p><p>AND ONLY AFTERWARDS WILL THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE </p><p>DECIDE IF IT IS INTERESTED IN CONFEDERATION WITH </p><p>JORDAN\' (IN STOCKHOLM, 6.6). </p><p> </p><p>-   (C)  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE AMMAN AGREEMENT IS </p><p>EXCEEDINGLY CLEAR; IT SPEAKS OF ARAB CONFEDERAL UNION </p><p>BETWEEN TWO STATES -- JORDAN AND PALESTINE\' </p><p>(AL-BIYADER AL-SIYASI, 15.6). </p><p> </p><p>D.  PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>(1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT STATES IN CLAUSE </p><p>5:  \'PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE HELD WITHIN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, TO BE </p><p>ATTENDED BY THE FIVE UN SECURITY COUNCIL PERMANENT </p><p>MEMBER-STATES AND ALL PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT, </p><p>INCLUDING THE PLO, WHICH IS THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE WITHIN A JOINT </p><p>DELEGATION -- A JOINT JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN </p><p>DELEGATION.\' </p><p> </p><p>(2)  SOME SAW THE REFERENCE TO A JOINT DELEGATION AS </p><p>A DEVIATION FROM THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE FEZ SUMMIT </p><p>(1974), WHICH GRANTED THE PLO SOLE RIGHT TO REPRESENT </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>(3)  BUT THE PLO REJECTS THIS REASONING AND INSISTS </p><p>THAT IT ALONE HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  THE \'FATAH\' CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>\'MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\' (20.3) SAID AS </p><p>FOLLOWS:  \'THE PLO, AS A SOLE AND LEGAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, IS THE BODY </p><p>RECOGNIZED BY THE ARABS AND THE WORLD AS HAVING SOLE </p><p>LEGITIMACY TO NEGOTIATE WITHOUT GRANTING POWER OF </p><p>ATTORNEY, OR AGREEMENT, OR PERMISSION TO ANY OTHER </p><p>PARTY TO PARTICIPATE WITH IT IN REPRESENTING THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN ALL MATTERS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FLATEN </p><p></p></div>
