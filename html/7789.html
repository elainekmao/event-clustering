<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000815 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO FOLLOWS THROUGH -- ASKS </p><p>INEC TO PROBE ELECTORAL IRREGULARITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: FRAZER-JETER TELCONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Per Ref telcons, Ambassador Jeter told Special </p><p>Presidential Advisor for International Affairs Ad\'obe </p><p>Obe that President Obasanjo needed to take the high </p><p>road by acknowledging that there had been serious </p><p>allegations of material electoral manipulation. We </p><p>also conveyed to Obe that Washington would look </p><p>favorably on a public statement from Obasanjo </p><p>requesting that INEC actively and impartially </p><p>investigate allegations of significant electoral </p><p>misconduct. Obasanjo has delivered on these requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Local newspapers reported May 1 that President </p><p>Obasanjo wrote a letter to Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission Chairman Abel Guobadia. In that </p><p>letter, the President cited the Commonwealth Observer </p><p>report on the elections, which the letter described as </p><p>"fair and commendatory to INEC and the Federal </p><p>Government."  (Comment: The Commonwealth Report was </p><p>the most favorable and offered the mildest criticism </p><p>of all the reports from the international monitoring </p><p>teams. End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nevertheless, the President\'s letter </p><p>mentioned that the Commonwealth team saw widespread </p><p>irregularities in certain areas, such as parts of </p><p>Enugu and Rivers states.  The letter also drew </p><p>attention to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Report </p><p>that there were areas where "elections did not take </p><p>place." The letter asked INEC to investigate these </p><p>allegations and report its findings to President </p><p>Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While Obasanjo\'s letter to INEC could have been </p><p>stronger, he has done what we asked.  At this point, </p><p>we should send a congratulatory message to Obasanjo. </p><p>We gain nothing by putting this off, especially since </p><p>many Heads of State have now publicly congratulated </p><p>Obasanjo, including a congratulatory call from Prime </p><p>Minister Tony Blair earlier this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo followed our advice at some political </p><p>risks to himself.  Already, the ANPP and 15 other </p><p>political parties are saying that Obasanjo\'s letter to </p><p>INEC has vindicated their charges of "rigging."  A </p><p>congratulatory message from President Bush may make </p><p>Obasanjo feel more secure and thus more comfortable. </p><p>If so, he would be more amenable to entering political </p><p>discussions with key opposition parties that may be </p><p>needed in order to calm the tensions created by the </p><p>elections and their disputed results, especially over </p><p>some gubernatorial and numerous National Assembly </p><p>seats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Some Nigerians will be pleased that </p><p>Obasanjo wrote this letter. Others will view it </p><p>cynically, choosing to believe that Obasanjo merely </p><p>wants to effect a veneer of probity.  Others will </p><p>point out that Obasanjo eagerly embraced the </p><p>Commonwealth report because it is the most forgiving </p><p>of the international observer accounts.  They believe </p><p>the baseline created by the Commonwealth report is too </p><p>low; any investigation that tracks the Commonwealth </p><p>report will be too modest to adequately address the </p><p>irregularities that occurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment Cont: At this difficult moment, a lot </p><p>of people are testy, including Obasanjo.  Few people </p><p>want to move from their hard-line positions and no one </p><p>wants to be the first to concede. However, with the </p><p>letter, Obasanjo has taken a positive step by </p><p>implicitly acknowledging electoral malfeasance in some </p><p>areas that might have changed the outcome of some </p><p>National Assembly and gubernatorial races.  Before </p><p>this post-election period is over, he will likely need </p><p>to take a few more such steps.  We can perhaps </p><p>encourage him in this but only if he knows that we </p><p>have accepted his victory. Thus, a congratulatory </p><p>message from Washington in the form of a letter from </p><p>President Bush would be timely and useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
