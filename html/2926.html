<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002334 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, PGOV, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: EAST BANK-WEST BANK DIVIDE GROWS AS INTIFADA </p><p>INTENSIFIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1805 B. AMMAN 2070 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Over the past few weeks the Israeli offensive in the </p><p>West Bank has </p><p>highlighted a trend we have seen growing as the Intifada has </p><p>intensified--the </p><p>cleavage between Palestinian Jordanians (West Bankers) and </p><p>Transjordanians </p><p>(East Bankers).  Residual mistrust left over from the 1970 </p><p>PLO attempt to </p><p>overthrow the Hashemites has resurfaced, and there is growing </p><p>fear that Israel </p><p>could try to force Palestinians from the West Bank into </p><p>Jordan.  While most </p><p>East Bankers openly support the Palestinian cause, many have </p><p>privately </p><p>expressed resentment that Palestinian Jordanians are once </p><p>again a destabilizing </p><p>force in the country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>EAST BANKERS: LINGERING DISTRUST </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The protests in recent weeks against the Israeli </p><p>incursions have </p><p>sharpened the division between East and West Bankers.  This </p><p>division is </p><p>particularly acute in Amman, where Badia police from </p><p>traditional East Bank </p><p>areas were brought in to deter pro-Palestinian protests. </p><p>While many </p><p>Palestinian contacts have blanched at the government\'s use of </p><p>the Badia police, </p><p>many East Bank contacts have conveyed their resentment that </p><p>Palestinians are </p><p>once again posing a challenge to the authority of the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While few Palestinians refer back to the 1970 </p><p>Palestinian attempt to </p><p>usurp King Hussein, also known as Black September, East </p><p>Bankers more frequently </p><p>bring up the topic to explain their lingering distrust of </p><p>Palestinian Jordanian </p><p>intentions here.   While most East Bank contacts acknowledge </p><p>that the </p><p>circumstances that allowed the Palestinians to challenge King </p><p>Hussein in 1970 </p><p>no longer exist, distrust and resentment remain. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Several East Bank contacts told Poloff that tensions </p><p>between Palestinian </p><p>Jordanians and East Bankers increased substantially during </p><p>the demonstrations </p><p>over the past few weeks.  While many were sympathetic to the </p><p>protesters\' cause, </p><p>East Bankers were unsure how far the mostly Palestinian </p><p>demonstrators would </p><p>push the government.  One East Bank government official was </p><p>enraged after </p><p>hearing reports (unconfirmed) that refugee camp residents </p><p>were burning pictures </p><p>of King Abdullah and Queen Rania.  Another East Bank Foreign </p><p>Ministry contact </p><p>pointed to the experience of the Palestinians in Kuwait, "the </p><p>Kuwaitis took </p><p>them in and gave them good jobs, they live there for 30 </p><p>years, then Saddam </p><p>invades and the Palestinians turn on their hosts."  This </p><p>tension has also crept </p><p>into the business sector.  The Chairman of the Irbid Chamber </p><p>of Industry spoke </p><p>with frustration recently about attempts by the Amman Chamber </p><p>of Industry to </p><p>politicize the work of the Chambers in Amman, Irbid, and </p><p>Zarqa.  In contrast to </p><p>the pro-business (and East Banker-controlled) Chambers in </p><p>Irbid and Zarqa, </p><p>which count a number of QIZ producers among their membership, </p><p>he noted the </p><p>Amman Chamber is dominated by Palestinian Jordanians, has </p><p>close ties to </p><p>Islamist professional associations, and has been pushing hard </p><p>to get the </p><p>Chambers to call for a boycott of U.S. goods and of </p><p>businesses that deal with </p><p>Israel. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Another underlying East Bank fear is that continued </p><p>Israeli incursions </p><p>in the West Bank will push large numbers of Palestinians into </p><p>Jordan.  It is </p><p>widely believed here that Jordan can not absorb another wave </p><p>of Palestinians. </p><p>East Bank reluctance to sever ties with Israel in part stems </p><p>from their mutual </p><p>peace treaty, which they see as a guarantee that Israel will </p><p>not conduct </p><p>large-scale expulsions of Palestinians to Jordan.  (see Ref </p><p>B)  King Abdullah </p><p>and Prime Minister Abul Ragheb have both issued public </p><p>statements in the last </p><p>month confirming that Jordan would close its bridges if faced </p><p>with a </p><p>large-scale refugee flow.  Indeed, during Israeli incursions, </p><p>Jordan on </p><p>occasion has closed the land border or has limited the hours </p><p>for crossing to </p><p>stem the traffic flow from the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While some East Bank contacts see the demonstrations </p><p>creating </p><p>instability, some East Bank contacts also place some blame on </p><p>the government </p><p>for its heavy-handed use of the police in the last few weeks. </p><p> Nasir al-Lawzi, </p><p>a well-connected East Banker, told Poloff that he was </p><p>particularly concerned </p><p>when the opposition was scheduling a large protest in spite </p><p>of a government </p><p>ban. (see Ref A)  "The situation was very explosive, </p><p>particularly if the police </p><p>overreacted--what would happen if the police killed a </p><p>protester?" </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WEST BANKERS: FEELING INSECURE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In return, many Palestinians here have complained </p><p>about heavy-handed </p><p>government tactics and say these tactics betray the </p><p>government\'s </p><p>anti-Palestinian bias.  Poloff recently has heard some </p><p>anecdotal stories about </p><p>police harassment of Palestinian Jordanians.  Most stories </p><p>revolve around </p><p>name-calling and occasional unprovoked beatings.  Former </p><p>Royal Court advisor </p><p>Adnan Abu Odeh said that Jordan is the only country that </p><p>mentioned "national </p><p>unity" when calling for calm.  Abu Odeh questioned why </p><p>demonstrations against </p><p>the Israeli offensive would threaten national unity, "it </p><p>implies that </p><p>Palestinians are anti-Israeli and Transjordanians are </p><p>pro-Israeli."  Abu Odeh </p><p>believes (we think mistakenly) that the GOJ inserted </p><p>undercover security </p><p>officers into the demonstrations to provoke the crowd, </p><p>thereby justifying its </p><p>harsh response. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Throughout the recent round of demonstrations, lasting </p><p>roughly five </p><p>weeks, we have heard several anecdotal stories of </p><p>Palestinians in the Rabia </p><p>area worried about the presence of the Badia police, one </p><p>family even leaving </p><p>their home for the weekends when the Badia were brought in to </p><p>patrol.  These </p><p>Palestinians feared that Badia police would not recognize the </p><p>difference </p><p>between Palestinian protesters and Palestinian residents. </p><p>Though still very </p><p>angry at the ongoing situation, Palestinians appear reluctant </p><p>to protest too </p><p>loudly since the government established the "red-line" for </p><p>demonstrations that </p><p>were planned on April 12 (see ref). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Abu Odeh attributes some of the Palestinian reluctance </p><p>to test the </p><p>government\'s "red-line" to the Palestinian feeling that they </p><p>are merely </p><p>residents of Jordan, not citizens.  As such, they believe </p><p>their position in </p><p>Jordan, economically and socially, is at the mercy of the </p><p>government and </p><p>security services.  Abu Odeh said he was not surprised that </p><p>the opposition </p><p>backed down and canceled demonstrations on April 12 when the </p><p>government stepped </p><p>up security.  He said the Muslim Brotherhood rank and file is </p><p>made up of </p><p>Palestinians, but the leadership is made up of </p><p>Transjordanians.  The </p><p>Transjordanian leadership, according to Abu Odeh, want to </p><p>maintain some </p><p>friendliness with the government, otherwise it would risk </p><p>their future ability </p><p>to secure high-ranking ministerial positions. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While some see the division between East Bank and </p><p>West Bank clearly, a </p><p>few contacts stress that Jordanians are united.  One East </p><p>Bank contact said </p><p>that relations between East Bankers and West Bankers are </p><p>getting so intertwined </p><p>that it is difficult to completely separate the two.  "When a </p><p>Palestinian in </p><p>the West Bank is killed, condolences are received in the East </p><p>Bank."  Abdul </p><p>Karim Abul Haija, Director General of Jordan\'s Department of </p><p>Palestinian </p><p>Affairs, told Refcoord that the situation was so bad during </p><p>the demonstrations </p><p>because "our own people are firing on us."  However, it seems </p><p>clear that </p><p>Transjordanians with a stronger sense of their East Bank </p><p>identity do not see </p><p>that as the case. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The East Bank-West Bank division is a complex </p><p>nationality issue in </p><p>Jordan.  Many Palestinian Jordanians emphasize that they </p><p>consider themselves </p><p>solely "Jordanians" since they were born in the West Bank </p><p>when it was under </p><p>Jordanian control.  However, East Bankers still tend to </p><p>question the loyalty of </p><p>Palestinian Jordanians and to which state they are most loyal </p><p>to--Jordan or the </p><p>future Palestine.  Almost all Jordanians--East Bank and West </p><p>Bank--support the </p><p>Palestinian cause, but the rise in Palestinian activism </p><p>during the last several </p><p>weeks--and the fact that it is mostly East Bankers who have </p><p>responsibility for </p><p>maintaining order--has exacerbated this division in Jordanian </p><p>society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
