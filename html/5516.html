(C/NF) SUMMARY:  In a February 3 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, senior Sri Lankan Minister Peiris -- like </p><p>other contacts -- set low expectations for the </p><p>February 7-8 GSL-LTTE talks in Berlin.  He said he </p><p>primarily wanted to use Berlin to lay the groundwork for </p><p>future rounds, including by raising division of power </p><p>issues.  He also underscored the importance of phased </p><p>disarmament/demobilization by the LTTE.  He said the GSL </p><p>was newly focused on the need to show economic progress. </p><p>Peiris was as sharp as ever, but seemed a bit weary with </p><p>the weighty issues he is contending with.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PEIRIS ON BERLIN </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) The Ambassador and polchief met February 3 </p><p>with G.L. Peiris, the GSL Minister of Constitutional </p><p>Affairs and Enterprise Development, and a key player on </p><p>peace process issues.  As with other contacts (see </p><p>Reftels, including comments by GSL Minister Moragoda), </p><p>Peiris set low expectations for the GSL talks with the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) slated to take </p><p>place in Berlin, February 7-8.  (Note:  The Berlin talks </p><p>will constitute the fifth round of talks held between </p><p>the two sides since September 2002.  The Norwegian </p><p>government is facilitating the talks.)  One of the key </p><p>reasons for low expectations, Peiris related, was that </p><p>LTTE senior negotiator Anton Balasingham will not have </p><p>been able to receive a briefing from LTTE leaders before </p><p>Berlin and, thus, would not have received a "new </p><p>mandate" from them.  Given this situation, Balasingham </p><p>would probably be reluctant to make any new commitments </p><p>in Berlin.  (Note:  Balasingham had been scheduled to </p><p>visit the LTTE-controlled Wanni region in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka in January, but postponed the visit due to health </p><p>concerns.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) One item on the agenda for Berlin, Peiris </p><p>noted, was that of humanitarian and developmental </p><p>assistance to LTTE-controlled areas.  The Tigers had </p><p>been vociferously complaining that the GSL\'s delivery of </p><p>such assistance was poor and plagued by bureaucracy. </p><p>Admitting to the Ambassador that the GSL was having a </p><p>problem coordinating such assistance, Peiris wanted to </p><p>use Berlin to assure the LTTE that the government was </p><p>committed to do doing a better job in this area. </p><p>(Note:  In addition to assistance, human rights in LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas are another agenda item.) </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE WAY AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF)  To stimulate LTTE thinking about the way </p><p>ahead, Peiris remarked that he planned to hold a </p><p>"private" meeting with Balasingham on the margins of the </p><p>Berlin talks.  At that meeting and in other discussions </p><p>in the near-term, he wanted to touch on a number of </p><p>issues with the LTTE, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- DIVISION OF POWERS:  In his private chat with </p><p>Balasingham, he wanted to raise possible division of </p><p>power options relating to the north and east.  The idea </p><p>would be for the two sides to come up with a document </p><p>that set out which powers would remain with the "center" </p><p>and which would be given to a north/east unit.  This </p><p>document would represent a blueprint for a possible </p><p>final settlement down the road.  It might be possible to </p><p>publicize an agreement on this issue at the March round </p><p>if Balasingham was able to vet it with his authorities </p><p>during his planned trip to the Wanni in early March. </p><p>(Note:  The sixth round of talks is scheduled to take </p><p>place in Japan, March 18-21.)  Re another division of </p><p>powers issue, Peiris said the Muslim demand for a </p><p>separate unit was not feasible.  Muslims needed some </p><p>protections, but these would have to worked out once a </p><p>GSL-LTTE constitutional framework had been settled on -- </p><p>and not before.  It was unfortunate that Muslim leader </p><p>Rauf Hakeem continued to demand a unit, but he was a </p><p>weak leader trying to score points with his community. </p><p>(Note:  Peiris noted that in a visit to India later this </p><p>month he planned to study how the Indian government </p><p>dealt with minority issues in Darjeeling.  What the GoI </p><p>did regarding this region might be a possible model for </p><p>what the GSL did regarding the Muslims, i.e., providing </p><p>a community protections without creation of a full-blown </p><p>constitutionally-mandated entity.) </p><p> </p><p>-- DISARMAMENT/DEMOBILIZATION:  Peiris noted that </p><p>disarmament/demobilization issues were important and </p><p>needed to be discussed soon with the LTTE.  The GSL\'s </p><p>strong view was that the LTTE had to take phased steps </p><p>along the road toward disarmament and demobilization. </p><p>The idea was for the LTTE\'s military to be eventually </p><p>brought into the Sri Lankan military structure.  If all </p><p>the LTTE\'s troops could not fit into the GSL military, </p><p>then "productive" jobs would need to be found for those </p><p>that were demobilized.  It was also possible, however, </p><p>that some LTTE units might be devolved into some sort of </p><p>police or "civil guard" for the north and east.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked whether the GSL had given any thought </p><p>to the notion that the LTTE might agree to international </p><p>supervision of its long-range weapons on the Jaffna </p><p>Peninsula.  (Note:  The Indian High Commissioner and the </p><p>Ambassador discussed this idea in a February 3 meeting, </p><p>per Reftel.)  Peiris responded that this was a very </p><p>constructive idea.  (Note:  At the request of the GSL, </p><p>Satish Nambiar, a retired Indian general, has been </p><p>visiting Sri Lanka the past several days.  Nambiar\'s </p><p>brief is to review the Sri Lankan military\'s security </p><p>zones in Jaffna, and other matters related to possible </p><p>military drawdowns by the GSL and LTTE.) </p><p> </p><p>-- LOCAL ELECTIONS IN NE:  Another matter that Peiris </p><p>said he planned to raise with Balasingham involved local </p><p>elections in the north and east.  These elections had </p><p>been scheduled to take place last year, but had been </p><p>postponed at the behest of the LTTE.  The government was </p><p>coming under some pressure to hold the elections because </p><p>they could not be postponed indefinitely per the Sri </p><p>Lankan Constitution.  He added that he thought the </p><p>holding of elections would be a good idea because it </p><p>would test the support of the pro-LTTE Tamil National </p><p>Alliance (TNA).  Although the TNA would probably sweep </p><p>the board, it would have to do so in a democratic </p><p>context, with other parties -- including anti-LTTE Tamil </p><p>parties (the EPDP, EPRLF) -- allowed to participate. </p><p>Peiris said he planned to review with Balasingham the </p><p>idea of holding the elections in May 2003.  He was not </p><p>sure what the LTTE\'s reaction would be. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) Wrapping up this part of the conversation, </p><p>Peiris commented that what the government most needed </p><p>from the LTTE soon was some sort of "signal" from the </p><p>group.  While it was not clear, it seemed that the group </p><p>was content as things were and it was not considering </p><p>the next steps.  This was creating a problem for the </p><p>GSL, which needed to show the public in the south that </p><p>the process still had traction.  Given this situation, </p><p>some sort of move by the Tigers showing that they are </p><p>intent on ending forced child recruitment or ending </p><p>taxation or starting disarmament, etc., would be most </p><p>welcome.  It would show to the Sinhalese south that the </p><p>LTTE was committed to the process and wanted to make it </p><p>irreversible.  He added that he intended to tell </p><p>Balasingham that positive moves would also help with </p><p>opening the pockets of donors in the run-up to the </p><p>international conference planned for Tokyo in June.  The </p><p>Ambassador, underscoring U.S. support for the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative, remarked that Peiris\' thinking was on </p><p>target in that it was high time that the LTTE did more </p><p>to move the peace process forward. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC FOCUS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) While working on the peace process, Peiris </p><p>underlined that the government was also focused on the </p><p>economy.  The GSL knew that the president and the rest </p><p>of the opposition, including the radical Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna party (JVP), were trying to make the </p><p>economy a big issue.  While the government felt </p><p>relatively positive about rural areas, since the recent </p><p>harvest had been good, it was a bit worried about urban </p><p>areas where there had been price rises and other </p><p>dislocations.  The Prime Minister had ordered ministers </p><p>to travel the country to show their concern about the </p><p>economy to the public.  Peiris related that he had </p><p>recently visited Matara, a district in the deep south, </p><p>to highlight various government initiatives.  He noted </p><p>that the United National Party (UNP) -- based on past </p><p>stints in power -- had a good reputation as a manager of </p><p>the economy, which it not want to lose.  The Ambassador </p><p>commented that this renewed emphasis on the economy was </p><p>positive.  That said, the U.S. would urge the government </p><p>to continue to make economic reform and liberalization </p><p>key priorities.  Simply because the government felt </p><p>vulnerable on the economy, did not mean it should put </p><p>these priorities on the backburner.  Peiris replied that </p><p>reform and liberalization remained on the agenda, </p><p>although plans in these areas needed careful modulation. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Peiris, one of the country\'s best and most </p><p>learned lawyers, is known to be extremely bright, and -- </p><p>true to form -- he was as sharp as ever in the meeting. </p><p>His comments indicated that he was thinking out </p><p>complicated next steps in the peace process, including </p><p>engagement with the LTTE on division of powers and on </p><p>disarmament/demobilization issues.  Whether the LTTE </p><p>wants to play ball is another question entirely, but </p><p>Peiris, at least, seemed to have a sensible-sounding </p><p>outline of a plan.  As Peiris discussed these matters, </p><p>however, there was a bit of weariness about him, as if </p><p>all the weighty issues he is contending with are getting </p><p>him down.  We had also noticed this seeming fatigue </p><p>during a recent meeting with Milinda Moragoda, another </p><p>key minister (see Reftel).  It is as if the GSL has its </p><p>hands full and is sweating it out a bit -- which is </p><p>probably not the best frame of mind to have when </p><p>negotiating with the hedgehog-like LTTE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
