<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 10239 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, EAGR, SO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW OPPOSITION GROUP APPEARS </p><p> </p><p>REF: MOGADISHU 9988 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONDFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  A NOMALI OPPOSITION GROUP, THE SOMALI </p><p>DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, HAS BEEN FORMED.  ACCORDING TO USC </p><p>LEADERS, THE SDM GREW OUT OF THE SO-CALLED "MESOPOTAMIAN </p><p>MANIFESTO," WHICH WAS DRAFTED BY RAHANWEYNE FARMERS TO </p><p>PROTEST GSDR POLICIES, AND ESPECIALLY THE EXPROPRIATION </p><p>OF SOUTHERN FARM LAND TO GIVE TO MAREHAN.  THE USC HAS </p><p>TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO PERSUADE THE GOVERNMENTS OF </p><p>EGYPT AND ITALY TO INVITE THE SDM TO THE CAIRO </p><p>ROUNDTABLE TALKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A GROUP OF MEMBERS OF THE LARGELY-AGRICULTURAL </p><p>RAHANWEYNE CLAN HAS ISSUED WHAT THEY CALL "THE FIRST </p><p>MANIFESTO OF JUBA AND SHABELLE," NAMED FOR THE AREA OF </p><p>THE TWO RIVERS OF SOUTHERN SOMALIA WHERE THE RAHANWEYNE </p><p>LIVE.  THE DOCUMENT HAS SINCE BECOME KNOWN ALSO AS THE </p><p>"MESOPOTAMIAN MANIFESTO."  POST IS POUCHING AN </p><p>UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF THE DOCUMENT TO AF/E. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE MANIFESTO DETAILS THE EVILS BROUGHT BY THE </p><p>CURRENT CIVIL WAR, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE PROBLEMS CAUSED </p><p>TO FARMERS.  IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHORS CRITICIZE THE </p><p>GSDR FOR HAVING EXPROPRIATED FARM LAND TO GIVE IT TO </p><p>MAREHAN, WHO FENCED IT OFF, ALLOWED IT TO LIE FALLOW, </p><p>AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR STATUS OF "FARMERS" TO </p><p>QUALIFY FOR LOANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE MANIFESTO CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF A </p><p>PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, UNSPECIFIED CQNGES IN THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE REGIONS AND TOWNS OF </p><p>SOMALIA, THE RETURN OF ILLEGALLY-TAKEN STATE PROPERTY </p><p>AND MONEY, AND THE NULLIFICATION OF THE FARM OWNERSHIP </p><p>LAW OF 1975, WHICH THEY HOLD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALL </p><p>IN FARM PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE AUTHORS REJECT THE USE OF ARMED STRUGGLE TO </p><p>REACH THEIR GOALS.  THEY ALSO DISAPPROVE OF THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION "BECAUSE OF ITS MANY DEFECTS," WHICH THEY </p><p>DO NOT ENUMERATE.  THEY CALL FOR A CONFERENCE TO BE </p><p>CONVENED TO PREPARE A NEW CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AT A LUNCHEON WITH LEADERS OF THE ABGAL/MURUSADE </p><p>WING OF THE UNITED SOMALI CONGRESS (USC) ON NOVEMBER </p><p>25, THE AMBASSADOR WAS TOLD THAT THE DRAFTERS OF THE </p><p>MESOPOTAMIAN MANIFESTO HAD FORMED AN OPPOSITION GROUP </p><p>CALLED THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, AND THAT THE </p><p>USC HAD--UNSUCCESSFULLY, SO FAR--ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>OF EGYPT AND ITALY TO INVITE THE SDM TO THE CAIRO </p><p>ROUNDTABLE TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT.  RESENTMENT OVER MAREHAN EXPROPRIATIONS OF </p><p>LAND, MOST OF WHICH OCCURRED YEARS AGO, HAS BEEN </p><p>INCREASING.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, MEMBERS OF A SMALL </p><p>DIR SUB-CLAN, THE BIO-MA\'AL HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN UP ARMS </p><p>AGAINST MAREHAN LAND OWNERS IN THE AREA SOUTH OF </p><p>MOGADISHU. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IT IS NUT SURPRISING THAT THE SDM SHOULD BE </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THE RELATIVELY PACIFIC ABGAL/MURUSADE </p><p>WING OF THE USC.  BOTH GROUPS CALL FOR THE FORMATION OF </p><p>A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE DRAFTING OF A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION, ALTHOUGH THE ABGAL/MURUSADE DO NOT REJECT </p><p>THE CURRENT ONE OUTRIGHT.  NEITHER USC WING REJECTS </p><p>ARMED OPPOSITION TO THE GSDR, OF COURSE, BUT THE ABGAL/ </p><p>MURUSADE ARE CLOSE TO THE MANIFESTO GROUP, WHICH </p><p>FAVORS PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
