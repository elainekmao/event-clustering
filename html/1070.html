(C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE HOSTED A </p><p>TWO HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTE MEETING WITH THE USG DELEGATION AT </p><p>HIS RESIDENCE IN HARARE ON 22 APRIL.  S/E WOLPE, AMB </p><p>MCDONALD, SPECIAL ADVISOR PRENDERGAST, LT. COL. GADDIS, AND </p><p>ECONOFF PROKOP ATTENDED.  S/E WOLPE REINFORCED THE USG </p><p>CONCERN THAT THERE BE GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE KAMPALA </p><p>CEASE-FIRE AND FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA, INCLUDING THE </p><p>COMPLETE RESTORATION OF DRC SOVEREIGNTY. HE ALSO ASKED IF </p><p>MUGABE WOULD CONSIDER, IN PRINCIPLE, A COMMITMENT TO CEASE </p><p>THE RE-SUPPLY AND TRAINING OF NON-STATE ACTORS AS A </p><p>CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE THAT COULD BE LINKED TO SPECIFIC </p><p>COMMITMENTS MADE BY RWANDA AND UGANDA ON FURTHER OR </p><p>ACCELERATED REDEPLOYMENT AND WITHDRAWAL.  MUGABE SAID THAT HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02222  01 OF 04  251443Z </p><p>WOULD CONSIDER SUCH MEASURES IF HE COULD BE SURE THAT, IN </p><p>RETURN, RWANDA AND UGANDA WOULD CEASE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THEIR </p><p>REBEL CLIENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE DELEGATION\'S VISIT </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) S/E WOLPE INFORMED PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT HE HAD COME, AT </p><p>THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT CLINTON, TO REINFORCE THE USG </p><p>CONCERN THAT THERE BE GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE KAMPALA </p><p>CEASE-FIRE BY ALL PARTIES AND TO EXPLORE WAYS OF ACCELERATING </p><p>THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT WITH REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ONE OF THE DELEGATION\'S GOALS IS TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING </p><p>OF EACH PARTY\'S BOTTOM LINE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO </p><p>HELP CRAFT INITIATIVES THAT EACH SIDE COULD TAKE THAT WOULD </p><p>INCREASE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE SHORT-TERM AND ENABLE </p><p>THE SIGNATORIES TO ACCELERATE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>LUSAKA AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) S/E WOLPE ASSURED PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT THE USG\'S </p><p>DEDICATION TO LUSAKA INCLUDED THE FULL RESTORATION OF </p><p>CONGOLESE SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, ADDING THAT </p><p>"THIS IS THE MESSAGE I WILL BE CARRYING TO RWANDA AND UGANDA." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) S/W WOLPE FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT IT IS THE USG\'S VIEW </p><p>THAT THE EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES ARE LOOKING SERIOUSLY FOR A WAY </p><p>OUT OF THE CONGO.  FROM THE USG PERSPECTIVE, THEREFORE, THE </p><p>TIME IS RIPE TO ADVANCE THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>DELEGATION WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE REPORT IT HAD RECEIVED FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MINISTERS OF JUSTICE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>CONCERNING THE RECENT VICTORIA FALLS MEETING BUT WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02222  01 OF 04  251443Z </p><p>PARTICULARLY WELCOME PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ACCOUNT OF THE </p><p>PROCEEDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND OF THE VIC FALLS MEETING </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE IDEA FOR THE MEETING </p><p>CAME UP IN A CONVERSATION HE HAD IN CAIRO INVOLVING HIMSELF, </p><p>CHISSANO, DOS SANTOS, AND MUSEVENI.   NOTE. EXPLAINING THE </p><p>ORIGINS OF THIS DISCUSSION, MUGABE SAID HE HAD FORTUITOUSLY </p><p>STUMBLED UPON WHAT WAS IN FACT AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN MUSEVENI </p><p>AND DOS SANTOS THAT WAS BEING FACILITATED BY CHISSANO.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  MUGABE SAID THAT HE ASKED "WHY CAN\'T WE MAKE UP OUR </p><p>OWN MINDS (TO GET OUT OF THE CONGO)?  WE ARE \'BIG PEOPLE\'; </p><p>WHY MUST WE WAIT FOR A STICK FROM THE UN TO DRIVE US </p><p>FORWARD?"  CHISSANO AND MUSEVENI AGREED AND CHISSANO PROPOSED </p><p>AN INFORMAL MEETING OF THE EXTERNAL LUSAKA SIGNATORIES.  THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WOULD BE TO FIND A WAY FOR THE </p><p>REGIONAL ACTORS TO IMPLEMENT THE CEASE-FIRE PROCESS </p><p>THEMSELVES IN THE EVENT THAT THE UN DEPLOYMENT WAS DELAYED. </p><p>THE LEADERS SUBSEQUENTLY AGREED TO MEET IN VIC FALLS ON 21 </p><p>APRIL.  UNFORTUNATELY, THREE DAYS BEFORE THE MEETING DATE, </p><p>DOS SANTOS BACKED OUT, ARGUING THAT ALL OF THE LEADERS HAD </p><p>BEEN INVITED TO A MALARIA CONFERENCE IN ABUJA TWO DAYS LATER, </p><p>AND IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT TO MAKE ABUJA THE VENUE OF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0620 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02222  02 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01 </p><p>      OIGO-02  FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------4FAA16  251444Z /38 </p><p>P 251448Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5847 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINSHASA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02222  02 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, DAS POWELL </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADORS HOLBROOKE AND SODERBERG </p><p>USUN/W FOR ORR </p><p>STATE PASS DOD FOR OSD/PKHA/JSCHEAR </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH AND ERIC SCHWARTZ </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE DISCUSSES DRC DISENGAGEMENT AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT WITH ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>DRC DISCUSSION AS WELL.  PAUL KAGAME, TOO, WAS UNABLE TO COME </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS PENDING INAUGURATION; HOWEVER, HE SENT HIS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND EMMANUEL GASANA. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE\'S ACCOUNT OF THE MEETING </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE REPORTED THAT THE MEETING WAS "POSITIVE, </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD, HONEST."  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JMC/PC </p><p>KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT, THE LEADERS AGREED TO COMMIT </p><p>THEMSELVES TO HONOR THE 30-KILOMETER DMZ.  THEY ALSO AGREED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A REGIONAL MONITORING MECHANISM COMPOSED OF </p><p>JOINT TEAMS FROM EACH PARTY TO SUPERVISE THE CEASE-FIRE IN </p><p>THE EVENT THAT THE UN DEPLOYMENT IS DELAYED.  THE MEANS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE SELF-MONITORING REGIME - TRANSPORTATION, </p><p>FUNDING, ETC. -- ARE YET TO BE WORKED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE INSISTED THAT THE KEY TO MAINTAINING </p><p>FAITH IN THE SELF-MONITORING APPROACH WOULD BE APPROPRIATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02222  02 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>ACTIONS ON THE GROUND. IN TIME, WITH CONCRETE PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, CONFIDENCE WILL GROW. HOWEVER, HE </p><p>ADDED A NOTE OF CAUTION: "WE WILL STILL NEED TO RESERVE A </p><p>LITTLE OF OURSELVES IN CASE THE OTHER SIDE DOES WHAT WE FEAR </p><p>THEY WILL DO.  IF THEY DO NOT (BREAK THEIR COMMITMENTS), THEN </p><p>BOTH SIDES WILL BEGIN TO RELAX." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE PRESIDENT ENDED HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE CONGO PORTION </p><p>OF THE VIC FALLS MEETING BY SAYING "NOW WE HAVE TO INFORM </p><p>CHILUBA ABOUT THE MEETING THAT HAPPENED IN HIS BACK YARD." </p><p>HE ADDED, JOKINGLY, THAT "CHILUBA WILL BE WONDERING WHAT IS </p><p>GOING ON."  MUGABE THEN TURNED TO THE SECOND SUBJECT </p><p>DISCUSSED AT VIC FALLS - ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM ISSUE AND </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS - AND LAUNCHED INTO A VERY LENGTHY AND </p><p>DETAILED EXPOSITION OF GOZ VIEWS AND ACTIONS (REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>BACK TO THE DRC </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS, S/E </p><p>WOLPE ASKED THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT WHAT THF USG COULD DO AT </p><p>THIS POINT TO ACCELERATE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA </p><p>AGREEMENT.  SPECIFICALLY, WOLPE ASKED, WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE DRC AND ITS ALLIES TO COMMIT TO ACTIONS THAT WOULD </p><p>MITIGATE RWANDAN AND UGANDAN SECURITY CONCERNS, IN EXCHANGE </p><p>FOR AN UGANDAN AND RWANDAN COMMITMENT TO A MORE RAPID </p><p>REDEPLOYMENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE REPLIED THAT, FOR THEIR PART, RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA COULD BEST DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT BY AN ACTUAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC.  HE FURTHER SAID THAT RWANDA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02222  02 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>UGANDA, AND BURUNDI COULD BEST GUARANTEE THEIR SECURITY BY </p><p>DEDICATING THEMSELVES TO GOOD RELATIONS WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS </p><p>AND AMONG THEIR OWN POPULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) AS FOR THE NON-STATE ACTORS, MUGABE INSISTED THAT </p><p>HUNTING THEM DOWN WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND WOULD NOT RESULT </p><p>IN THEIR ELIMINATION.  HE ADDED THAT THE NON-STATE ACTORS </p><p>WERE RELATIVELY FEW IN COMPARISON TO THE "HUGE ARMIES" OF THE </p><p>REBELS.  HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT "BOTH GROUPS MUST BE MADE </p><p>TOOTHLESS" AND POINTED OUT THE NEED FOR AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>REINTEGRATION PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) S/E WOLPE AGAIN RETURNED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DRC </p><p>AND ITS ALLIES AGREEING TO CEASE RE-SUPPLY AND TRAINING OF </p><p>THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE IN RETURN FOR A RECIPROCAL COMMITMENT </p><p>BY RWANDA AND UGANDA TO ACCELERATED REDFPLOYMENT AND </p><p>WITHDRAWAL.  THIS TIME MUGABE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER </p><p>MAKING SUCH A COMMITMENT IF IT WOULD CONVINCE RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DRC. HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD ALSO </p><p>WANT RWANDA AND UGANDA TO CEASE THEIR TRAINING AND RESUPPLY </p><p>OF THEIR REBEL CLIENTS. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE ON RELATIONS WITH RWANDA, UGANDA, BURUNDI </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0622 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02222  03 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01 </p><p>      OIGO-02  FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------4FAA22  251444Z /38 </p><p>P 251448Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5848 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINSHASA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02222  03 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, DAS POWELL </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADORS HOLBROOKE AND SODERBERG </p><p>USUN/W FOR ORR </p><p>STATE PASS DOD FOR OSD/PKHA/JSCHEAR </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH AND ERIC SCHWARTZ </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE DISCUSSES DRC DISENGAGEMENT AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT WITH ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHILE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>UGANDA HAD IMPROVED, THEY WERE STILL DIFFICULT WITH RWANDA. HE </p><p>SAID THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS DUE TO LACK OF SUFFICIENT </p><p>CONTACT.  HE NOTED THAT THE RWANDAN FOREIGN MTNISTER INFORMED </p><p>THOSE AT VIC FALLS THAT KAGAME, AS PRESIDENT, HAD COMMITTED </p><p>HIMSELF TO BE BOUND BY ANY DECISION MADE BY THE LUSAKA </p><p>SIGNATORIES.  MUGABE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT KAGAME APPEARED TO </p><p>BE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO CONTINUE THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) S/E WOLPE TOLD PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT HE HAS BEGUN TO </p><p>SENSE AN EVOLUTION IN RWANDA\'S THINKING.  THE RWANDANS NOW </p><p>APPEAR WILLING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND </p><p>GROUPS WITH REGARD TO THE CULPABILITY OF EXFAR/INTERAHAMWE </p><p>FORCES IN THE DRC FOR THE GENOCIDE.  THE RWANDANS, HE SAID, </p><p>HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MONITORING OF THE REINTEGRATION PROCESS.  S/E WOLPE ASSURED </p><p>MUGABE THAT THE USG WOULD WORK WITH THE RWANDANS TO DETERMINE </p><p>THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND TO ENSURE THAT IT IS REASONABLE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02222  03 OF 04  251444Z </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) MUGABE COMMENTED THAT IF THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN RWANDA </p><p>AND BURUNDI COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THE RETURN OF </p><p>EX-COMBATANTS, AND IF THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR </p><p>REINTEGRATION, THEIR CITIZENS WILL NOT WANT TO RETURN. </p><p>HOWEVER, IF A REHABILITATION MECHANISM EXISTS, THOSE WHO CAN </p><p>RETURN WILL DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>DEALING WITH KABILA </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) S/E WOLPE TOLD MUGABE OF USG EFFORTS TO CONVINCE KABILA </p><p>THAT HE COULD BENEFIT POLITICALLY BY COOPERATING WITH THE </p><p>NATIONAL DIALOGUE\'S FACILITATOR AND ADHERING TO THE LUSAKA </p><p>AGREEMENT.  HE ASKED MUGABE FOR HIS GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>KABILA\'S WILLINGNESS TO NOW BE BOUND BY THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) MUGABE REPLIED THAT KARILA WAS DOING HIS BEST TO ADHERE </p><p>TO THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH HE IS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT </p><p>DID NOT CONTAIN AN EXPLICIT DEMAND FOR THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF RWANDA AND UGANDA.  REGARDING THE NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, MUGABE SAID THAT KABILA HAD COMPLAINED THAT LUSAKA </p><p>WAS RESTRICTING HIM FROM ORGANIZING POIJTICAL SUPPORT AMONG </p><p>HIS OWN PEOPLE.  MUGABE SAID HE HAD EXPLAINED TO KABILA THAT </p><p>THERE WAS NO RESTRICTION ON HIS ABILITY TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>OTHERS, BUT THAT HE SHOULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE </p><p>AN EFFORT TO SUPPLANT PRESIDENT MASIRE\'S ROLE AS THE </p><p>FACILITATOR OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN DISSUADING KABILA FROM PROCEEDING WITH HIS PLANS </p><p>TO HOLD PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE </p><p>INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02222  03 OF 04  251444Z </p><p>19.  (C) MUGABE CLAIMED THAT THE LACK OF COOPERATION MASIRE </p><p>EXPERIENCED DURING HIS FIRST VISIT WAS PARTLY THE FAULT OF </p><p>REGIONAL LEADERS WHO HAD PROVIDED NO SUPPORT TO MASIRE.  FROM </p><p>KABILA\'S OBSERVATIONS, IT APPEARED THAT THE IACK OF </p><p>COOPERATION DURING HIS SECOND VISIT TO THE DRC WAS DUE TO </p><p>LACK OF COORDINATION: KABILA CLAIMED NO ONE KNEW MASIRE WAS </p><p>COMING OR WHAT HIS AGENDA WOULD BE.  MUGABE HIMSELF THOUGHT </p><p>THAT MASIRE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS TAKING HIS </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE UN AS OPPOSED TO THE OAU AND HE FELT </p><p>THAT THIS WAS INAPPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) MUGABE ASKED WOLPE WHY MASIRE WAS SO DEPENDENT ON THE </p><p>UN FOR STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.  S/E WOLPE EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT IT WAS THE OAU SECRETARY-GENERAL WHO HAD INDICATED THE </p><p>OAU LACKED SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND HAD URGED A SIGNIFICANT UN </p><p>ROLE.

HOWEVER, EVEN NOW, WOLPE NOTED, MASIRE HAS </p><p>VIRTUALLY NO ONE WITH THE APPROPRIATE EXPERTISE WORKING WITH </p><p>HIM.

(C) MUGABE IS NOT READY TO ABANDON KABILA, OR TO EVEN BEGIN </p><p>THE DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVES - AT LEAST WITH THE USG. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE, TOGETHER WITH HIS NAMIBIAN AND ANGOLAN ALLIES, </p><p>WILL INCREASE THEIR PRESSURE ON KABILA TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>LUSAKA AGREEMENT, PARTICULARLY REGARDING CEASE-FIRE </p><p>COMMITMENTS AND THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE.
