<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  16/17/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PARM, MASS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CDR, CENTCOM GENERAL FRANKS\' MAY </p><p>24-25, 2003 VISIT TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (A, </p><p>B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) GENERAL FRANKS: WELCOME BACK TO JORDAN. YOUR VISIT </p><p>PROVIDES AN OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>OF JORDAN FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND </p><p>THEIR CONTINUED EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN, CONGRATULATE THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS ON HIS RECENT PROMOTION TO </p><p>GENERAL, AND TO DISCUSS KEY ISSUES REGARDING THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION IN THE REGION. I AM SURE YOUR DISCUSSIONS WILL HELP </p><p>ENSURE THE KINGDOM,S CONTINUED SUPPORT IN THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM AND OTHER REGIONAL EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EMBASSY AMMAN AND YOUR JORDANIAN HOSTS LOOK FORWARD TO </p><p>YOUR VISIT TO AMMAN.  DURING YOUR VISIT, YOU WILL MEET AND </p><p>HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS KEY ISSUES WITH THE KING. AS </p><p>YOU KNOW YOUR VISIT COINCIDES WITH THE GOJ,S CELEBRATION OF </p><p>ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1946.  THERE IS </p><p>GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS FAST AND </p><p>EFFECTIVE.  HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE ARRIVING AT A TIME OF </p><p>CONTINUED DOMESTIC FRUSTRATION WITH THE SLOWNESS OF THE </p><p>REBUILDING PROCESS AND THE ONGOING VIOLENCE IN THE WEST BANK </p><p>AND GAZA.    MOST JORDANIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF PALESTINIAN </p><p>ORIGIN, REMAIN ACCUTELY CONCERNED ABOUT ISRAEL,S HARSH </p><p>TREATMENT OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS AND ITS PERCEIVED LACK OF </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE US-PROVIDED ROAD MAP.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JORDAN CONTINUES </p><p>TO BE A CLOSE AND COOPERATIVE ONE -- POLITICALLY, </p><p>ECONOMICALLY, MILITARILY AND ON INTELLIGENCE ISSUES.  JORDAN </p><p>HAS LONG BEEN A VOICE OF REASON IN THE MIDDLE EAST, A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT MILITARY PARTNER, AND AN IMPORTANT AND RELIABLE </p><p>TROOP CONTRIBUTING COUNTRY IN MISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD.  ONE </p><p>OF JORDAN,S UN PEACEKEEPERS WAS SAVAGELY KILLED IN THE CONGO </p><p>THIS WEEK.  JORDAN,S &FRONTLINE8 EFFORTS AS A COALITION </p><p>PARTNER IN THE WAR AGAINST TERROR AND IN REBUILDING IRAQ </p><p>CONTINUE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ISSUES THAT WILL ARISE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) THE FOLLOWING ITEMS MAY ARISE DURING YOUR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HM AND HIS JAF LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-  (C) AS ALWAYS, JORDANANIAN LEADERS AND PEOPLE ARE GRACIOUS </p><p>HOSTS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE U.S.  THEY WILL AFFIRM THEIR </p><p>COMMITMENT TO AN ONGOING PARTNERSHIP WITH US AND WILL THANK </p><p>YOU FOR AMERICA,S SUPPORT TO JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>-     (S) HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE CONCERNS.  JORDAN IS </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR IRAQ MAY NOT BE </p><p>ADEQUATE.  RESOURCE SHORTAGES SUCH AS FUEL, WATER, AND </p><p>SHELTER FOR IDPS ARE WATCHED WITH CONCERN BY THE KING,S </p><p>CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>- (S) TIMING OF CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITIES.  JORDAN AGAIN IS </p><p>CONCERNED THAT CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE FROM </p><p>SYRIA WITH ROCKETS, EXPLOSIVES, AND WEAPONS BEING SENT </p><p>ACROSS.  THEY WILL SEEK AN ACCELERATION OF THE PLANNED $75 </p><p>MILLION BORDER SECURITY AID PACKAGE. </p><p> </p><p>-     (S) USG REQUESTS OF JORDAN WITH REGARDS TO POST-WAR </p><p>ACTIVITIES. JORDAN WOULD WELCOME ANY INSIGHTS INTO POSSIBLE </p><p>ROLES THAT THEY CAN PLAY IN POST-WAR IRAQ.  THEY HAVE </p><p>REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT IN DEMINING, </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, TRANSPORTATION, INTERPRETERS, </p><p>MILITARY AND POLICE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, AND MEDICAL </p><p>SUPPORT IN IRAQ.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY REMAIN CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE FUTURE OF IRAQI OIL SUPPLIES TO JORDAN. </p><p>-   (C) THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN DESIRES TO RESUME THE ROBUST </p><p>EXERCISE SCHEDULE THAT THEY HAVE ENJOYED WITH ALL OF THE </p><p>CENTCOM COMPONENT COMMANDS.  ONGOING AND SCHEDULED PLANNING </p><p>CONFERENCES ARE A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DRECTION.  THEY PLAN TO </p><p>APPLY FOR FUTURE PARTICIPATION IN PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL DISCUSS REGIONAL </p><p>TRAINING EVENTS FOR SOF, F-16S, AND DEMINING AND </p><p>PEACEKEEPING.  THEY MAY ALSO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING </p><p>FUTURE BRIGHT STAR EXERCISES IN JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>-  (S) THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN, WHILE EAGER TO INVOLVE </p><p>ITSELF WITH THE REBUILDING OPERATION IN IRAQ, ALSO REMAINS </p><p>FOCUSED ON ITS OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.  THEY WILL ROTATE </p><p>FORCES IN THAT COUNTRY STARTING ON 22 MAY.  THEY WILL BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN YOUR VISION FOR THEIR PRESENCE THERE.  THEY ARE </p><p>INTERESTED ALSO IN SUPPLYING WEAPONS REFURBISHED IN JORDAN TO </p><p>THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY IF THE USG WILL SUPPORT SUCH AN </p><p>EFFORT.  THEY ARE SIMILARLY INTERESTED IN US SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TRAINING THE ANA IN A WIDE RANGE OF SKILLS WITH USG SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>- (C) THEY WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN ANY LESSONS LEARNED </p><p>FROM THE RECENT IRAQ WAR. </p><p> </p><p>- (S) THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP WILL EXPRESS THEIR CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE GWOT.  THEY FEAR JORDAN IS LIKELY TO BE ONE </p><p>OF THE NEXT TARGET IN THE LATEST SERIES OF AL-QAEDA ATTACKS </p><p>AND ARE TAKING ENERGETIC STEPS TO COUNTER THE POTENTIAL </p><p>THREAT.  THEY WILL SEEK ROBUST CT TRAINING AND INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SHARING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE JTF-W COMMANDER WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE OF </p><p>COALITION AND 1003V ACTIONS AS PART OF THE SCHEDULED COUNTRY </p><p>TEAM MEETING THE MORNING OF 25 MAY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AGAIN, I LOOK FORWARD TO WELCOMING YOU BACK TO </p><p>JORDAN.  BEST REGARDS. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
