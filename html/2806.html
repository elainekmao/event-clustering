<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR IO, DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, UNHRC-1, PREL, AORC, CU, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: 58TH UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS: CUBA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1229 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1218 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1164 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Further to Ref A, PolCouns April 19 passed a copy of </p><p>the draft Cuba resolution and diplomatic Note to Principal </p><p>Secretary to President Obasanjo, Stephen Oronsaye. PolCouns </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>emphasized that GRULAC states had come forward to sponsor and </p><p>support the resolution and that the resolution was mild in </p><p>tone, especially in view of the fact that the Cuban </p><p>government had intensified its intimidation of pro-democracy </p><p>activists and had committed numerous other human rights </p><p>abuses during the year.  He told Oronsaye that the resolution </p><p>was the top CHR priority for the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PolCouns remarked that Nigerian endorsement of the </p><p>resolution would be deeply appreciated.  At the very least, </p><p>Nigeria should factor the considerable GRULAC support and the </p><p>low-key tenor of the resolution into its decision by </p><p>abstaining.  Oronsaye nodded affirmatively, stating he would </p><p>pass the message to the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) Despite our efforts, Nigeria not only voted against </p><p>the resolution but actively solicited others to do so as </p><p>well.  Nigeria has a general policy of voting against </p><p>country-specific resolutions.  We understand that Nigeria\'s </p><p>Ambassador in Geneva began the session with instructions to </p><p>vote no, and we were told privately that these instructions </p><p>were reaffirmed by the Foreign Ministry approximately two </p><p>days before the vote.  We do not know what role Presidency </p><p>officials or President Obasanjo himself might have played in </p><p>the original or subsequent instructions.  Indeed, we cannot </p><p>confirm that he considered our demarche before the vote took </p><p>place. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
