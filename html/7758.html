<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DANIKA WALTERS AND ROB JACKSON DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, EAID, KDEM, KSEP, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: VICTIMS\' ASSISTANCE CENTER: GUATEMALA\'S HRDF GRANT </p><p>SUBMISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 79965 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 548 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Embassy Guatemala appreciates the opportunity to </p><p>propose an HRDF grant to help implement our human rights </p><p>strategy.(Ref A)  We believe that the Human Rights Victims\' </p><p>Assistance Center project outlined below offers an excellent </p><p>opportunity to increase the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s Office </p><p>capacity to help human rights defenders and victims recover </p><p>from threats and attacks they have suffered.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p>2. (U) Guatemala is a fledgling democracy that emerged from a </p><p>36-year civil war in 1996, that left approximately 200,000 </p><p>people dead or disappeared.  The internal conflict left a </p><p>legacy of disrespect for human rights and a lack of </p><p>confidence in the state\'s capacity to promote and protect </p><p>human rights.  The 1985 Constitution established the Human </p><p>Right\'s Ombudsman\'s office to operate as an independent </p><p>entity responsible for verification and protection of human </p><p>rights work. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) One of the USG\'s main objectives in Guatemala is </p><p>supporting the work of human rights organizations and </p><p>strengthening the domestic institutions that deal with the </p><p>same issues.  While some progress has been made during the </p><p>post-war era, violence continues to threaten the lives of </p><p>many Guatemalans, especially human rights workers.  This </p><p>project will help to better protect and counsel those who </p><p>have been harassed, as well as develop a domestic capacity to </p><p>respond to human rights emergencies. </p><p> </p><p>Objective </p><p>--------- </p><p>4. (U) The objective of the $50,000 HRDF grant would be to </p><p>provide funding for a new Victim\'s Assistance Center </p><p>established by the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s Office to provide </p><p>counseling and refuge for victims of recent and past human </p><p>rights abuses.  USAID supports the work of the Human Rights </p><p>Ombudsman\'s office and its links to civil society through </p><p>their human rights programs, but does not fund this </p><p>particular project.  The project does not duplicate existing </p><p>efforts; rather, it expands upon our current efforts to </p><p>strengthen the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s Office and to support </p><p>a more congenial environment for the defense of human rights. </p><p> </p><p>Method </p><p>------ </p><p>5. (U) The Human Rights Ombudsman\'s Office has established a </p><p>Victim\'s Center but lacks sufficient resources to carry out </p><p>its work effectively.  With our support, the Center (located </p><p>in the war-torn department of Chimaltenango) would provide </p><p>mental and physical health services, shelter, and legal </p><p>counseling to victims of human rights crimes. </p><p> </p><p>Results </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (U) The goal of the Victim\'s Center project would be to </p><p>firmly establish the center, with operations support to be </p><p>assumed by the Ombudsman\'s Office in the future.  The </p><p>Ombudsman\'s Office has already obtained the building and the </p><p>basic infrastructure for the Center.  Our financial support </p><p>would allow the Ombudsman\'s Office to hire professionals, </p><p>purchase administrative and medical supplies for the center, </p><p>and begin assisting victims.  Based on the 100-plus cases the </p><p>Ombudsman\'s Office has addressed over the past year, they </p><p>anticipate providing inpatient services to approximately ten </p><p>people per month. </p><p> </p><p>Implementing Organization </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) The Human Right\'s Ombudsman\'s Office will implement </p><p>the project.  The Ombudsman\'s Office is an independent, </p><p>autonomous government entity charged with human rights </p><p>verification and protection.  It receives a limited budget </p><p>annually from Congress. </p><p> </p><p>Budget </p><p>------ </p><p>8. (U) We are asking for up to $50,000 for the project to be </p><p>spent on the following items over an eight-month period: </p><p> </p><p>Staff Salaries: </p><p>Paramedics (2) : $7,100 </p><p>Center Coordinator (1) : $6,000 </p><p>Psychologist (1) : $12,150 </p><p>Psychologist\'s Assistant (1) : $6,075 </p><p>Security (2) : $5,060 </p><p>Cook (1) : $1,520 </p><p>Maintenance (2) : $2,530 </p><p> </p><p>Administrative Supplies: $5,060 </p><p>Medicine : $4,505 </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
