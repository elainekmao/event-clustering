<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EB/TPP/ABT/BTT </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USTR SPOONER/MILLER </p><p>USDOC FOR OTEXA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KTEX, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: Vietnam: GVN PLANS REDESIGN OF TEXTILE ALLOCATION </p><p>SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 500 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  An inter-ministerial GVN committee has begun a </p><p>comprehensive verification of the capacity of all factories </p><p>allocated quota to export to the U.S. in 2003.  MOT has </p><p>already revoked quota from factories that were found to have </p><p>over-reported their production capacity in their </p><p>applications for quota allocation.  MOT plans to revise the </p><p>allocation system for 2004, basing allocation on production </p><p>capacity rather than past performance.  This plan has raised </p><p>concerns with at least one U.S. buyer.  Vinatex, Vietnam\'s </p><p>state-owned textile conglomerate may be the biggest </p><p>beneficiary of this change.  Demonstrating an unprecedented </p><p>willingness to make the allocation system transparent, the </p><p>Ministry of Trade has been publishing all information </p><p>related to quota allocation on its website.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. As reported reftel, The Ministry of Trade\'s (MOT) quota </p><p>allocation system for Vietnam\'s 2003 exports of textiles and </p><p>garments to the U.S. was established May 27, just over one </p><p>month after the bilateral textile agreement was initialed in </p><p>Washington on April 25.  (Note:  The agreement was </p><p>officially signed July 17 in Hanoi.  End note.) MOT based </p><p>most of its allocation on past performance as well as on </p><p>factories\' reports of their production capacity.  Smaller </p><p>amounts of quota were allocated for new investment, firms </p><p>operating in remote areas, and firms that use locally- </p><p>produced materials. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In early July 2003, after the majority of the textile </p><p>quota for export to the U.S. had been allocated, an inter- </p><p>agency committee comprised of representatives from the </p><p>Ministries of Trade, Planning and Investment (MPI), and </p><p>Industry (MOI) was formed to review the outcome of the quota </p><p>allocation.  The committee assembled inspection teams </p><p>comprised of representatives from the three ministries as </p><p>well as officials from the local trade and customs </p><p>departments.  The teams were tasked with undertaking three </p><p>rounds of inspection visits to all of the factories that had </p><p>been allocated quota for 2003, including 550 enterprises </p><p>allocated  "past performance quota" and 250 enterprises </p><p>allocated "new investment" quota. </p><p> </p><p>4. During the first round of inspections, which took place </p><p>July 9 to July 16, over 100 enterprises, mainly those that </p><p>had been allocated "new investment" quota, were inspected. </p><p>51 enterprises were found to have presented misleading </p><p>information to MOT in their application for quota.  Of </p><p>these, the 43 enterprises that were found to have over- </p><p>reported their production capacities had their extra quota </p><p>plus twenty percent revoked. The remaining eight enterprises </p><p>were either trading companies with no production capacity, </p><p>or factories not yet operating.  These companies\' entire </p><p>quota was revoked.  The total quantity of quota revoked </p><p>during the first round of investigation was 178,210 doz., </p><p>mainly from categories 347/348 and 338/339.  This is equal </p><p>to about 0.8 percent of Vietnam\'s total quota in these </p><p>categories for export to the U.S. in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5. The second round of inspections began July 23 and will be </p><p>finished on August 4. The third round will start begin after </p><p>the visit of a U.S. Customs Textile Verification Production </p><p>Team August 2 - 22. </p><p> </p><p>New Mechanism for 2004 </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. MOT has begun working on a revised quota allocation </p><p>mechanism for 2004, which is to be announced mid August. </p><p>According to MOT officials, there will be significant </p><p>changes to the system used for 2003. MOT is considering </p><p>basing the new quota allocation system on factories\' </p><p>production capacity rather than past performance in 2004. </p><p>The draft allocation system will be sent first to MPI and </p><p>MOI for review.  The final draft will then be sent to the </p><p>textile industry for comment before it becomes effective. </p><p> </p><p>7. A U.S. buyer told econoff July 30 that the AmCham textile </p><p>subcommittee is already planning to submit suggestions to </p><p>MOT on the design of next year\'s allocation system.  The </p><p>buyer is opposed to a system based on production capacity, </p><p>noting that factories can easily stockpile machines in order </p><p>to garner additional quota.  The best mechanism for fairly </p><p>allocating quota next year, the buyer advised, would be for </p><p>MOT to use export performance for May to December 2003 (the </p><p>period when Vietnam was under quota this year) and </p><p>extrapolate the figures to get a full year\'s allocation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  It is possible that MOT\'s new proposed approach could </p><p>favor Vinatex, Vietnam\'s enormous textile and apparel </p><p>conglomerate.  Vinatex officials have told HCMC Econoff that </p><p>they plan to invest in major expansion and plan to increase </p><p>their share of Vietnam\'s apparel exports to the US from the </p><p>current 25 percent share to 40 percent in the future.  This </p><p>could be a good first step. </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT:  The GVN has received overall positive comments </p><p>from the industry for a relatively fair and transparent </p><p>quota allocation process this year.  The GVN clearly </p><p>internalized the mission\'s and the industry\'s repeated calls </p><p>for a fair and transparent allocation system.  MOT has been </p><p>responsive both to USG and industry suggestions regarding </p><p>the quota allocation system and has even published all </p><p>decisions and information regarding quota allocation on </p><p>MOT\'s website.  It will be interesting to see how well the </p><p>concerns of foreign buyers and producers will be considered </p><p>in the ongoing discussion of quota allocation for 2004. </p><p>They have been major supporters of distributing quota based </p><p>on past performance. </p><p>BELLARD </p><p></p></div>
