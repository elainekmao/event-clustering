<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST LEADERS ARRESTED IN KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 632 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  At least two important Maoist leaders have </p><p>been detained by security forces in recent days, police </p><p>sources told us.  Leading female cadre Rekha Sharma and her </p><p>husband were picked up in Kathmandu April 13.  The Inspector </p><p>General of Police (IGP) confirmed the arrests April 16, but </p><p>Army top brass declined to comment.  The arrests are a boost </p><p>to the government\'s efforts to counter the Maoists.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Two Maoists Apprehended in Capital </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) operation reportedly </p><p>apprehended two Maoist leaders, Rekha Sharma and Krishna Dhoj </p><p>Khadka, from their rented room in Kathmandu\'s Dallu </p><p>neighborhood April 13.  Rekha is president of the All Nepal </p><p>Women\'s Association (Revolutionary) and member of the Maoist </p><p>"Central People\'s Government," while Khadka, her husband, was </p><p>formerly president of the All Nepal National Independent </p><p>Students\' Union (Revolutionary).  Reportedly, Khadka had been </p><p>detained briefly in November, 2001, but had escaped. </p><p> </p><p>IGP Confirms; No Comment from Top Army Brass </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Local press reported the arrests April 16, and </p><p>low-level police personnel confirmed these reports to Post. </p><p>Then at an afternoon reception the Inspector General of </p><p>Police (IGP) Rana confirmed the arrests to Ambassador.  One </p><p>ranking army officer refused comment when contacted by DATT, </p><p>adding that the news of the arrest had not yet been </p><p>officially released. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal\'s Most Wanted </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A photograph of Rekha Sharma - along with pictures of </p><p>other Maoist leaders - was broadcast on local television last </p><p>week with an appeal to provide authorities with information </p><p>on her whereabouts.  Sources also told Post that Maoist </p><p>Central Committee member Muma Ram Khanal was picked up by </p><p>security forces in early April.  Khanal\'s arrest has not been </p><p>confirmed.  IGP Rana told the Ambassador that recently </p><p>another Maoist Central Committee member, Ajab Lal Yadav, was </p><p>killed in an encounter with police.  (Note:  According to </p><p>press reports quoting an official announcement, Yadav was </p><p>killed March 22 during a search operation in southeastern </p><p>Nepal\'s Saptari district.  Yadav had been in police custody </p><p>last year, but was released October 16, 2001 in response to a </p><p>demand put forth by the Maoists in their second round of </p><p>talks with government representatives.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Whether the result of "America\'s Most Wanted"-style </p><p>public participation or the security forces\' own </p><p>resourcefulness, the arrests have given a boost to the </p><p>government\'s efforts to counter the Maoists.  In recent weeks </p><p>the Maoists have conducted increasingly daring operations in </p><p>the Kathmandu valley - including setting off a bomb on a </p><p>bridge in broad daylight (Reftel).  Bringing in the apparent </p><p>leaders of this campaign should help bottle it up, and at the </p><p>same time improve public perceptions of the government\'s </p><p>handling of the crisis. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
