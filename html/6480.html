<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000575 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA, TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2004 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, ECON, ASEC, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OIL EXEC SAYS NIGERIAN OIL PRODUCTION AT FULL </p><p>CAPACITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 568 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: RHINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 B, D AND E </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. A senior industry source reports that </p><p>Nigerian crude oil production </p><p>is currently at full capacity.  He states that Nigeria is </p><p>likely producing just </p><p>over 2.2 million barrels of crude per day.  Ongoing communal </p><p>violence in the </p><p>Delta region is beginning to affect Shell Oil\'s production </p><p>and daily operations </p><p>of ChevronTexaco, and since all producers are pumping "flat </p><p>out," there is no </p><p>one left to pick up any prolonged drop in production.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A senior executive at ExxonMobil told Econoff that </p><p>while the drop in Shell </p><p>Oil\'s production caused by clashes between ethnic groups in </p><p>Delta State is </p><p>relatively minor in relation to overall output, the GON </p><p>cannot utilize its </p><p>normal practice of reallocating Shell\'s reduced volume to </p><p>other producers </p><p>because all producers are now pumping "flat out."  The </p><p>executive, who has 20 </p><p>years experience working in Mobil Oil\'s Nigerian and </p><p>international oil </p><p>operations, said that since late February, all crude </p><p>producers in Nigeria have </p><p>been pumping at full capacity, and Nigeria\'s output should be </p><p>at just over 2.2 </p><p>million barrels per day (bpd).  Shell announced this </p><p>afternoon that due to </p><p>ethnic violence, it closed </p><p>five of its facilities in the Warri area, which reduces its </p><p>output by 76,000 </p><p>bpd. Shell total output is estimated at 970,000 bpd. </p><p>According to the </p><p>executive, ExxonMobil is producing approximately 620,000 bpd </p><p>of crude and </p><p>condensates.  ChevronTexaco is estimated to be producing </p><p>517,000 bpd. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In the past week, activists from the Ijaw ethnic </p><p>community have been </p><p>disrupting vessel traffic along the waterways of the Escravos </p><p>River in </p><p>Southwest Delta state near the town of Warri, resulting in </p><p>gun battles with </p><p>police and military units (reftel).  This escalated into </p><p>direct attacks against </p><p>both ethnic Itsekiri villages and a Shell Oil facility.  Both </p><p>Shell and </p><p>ChevronTexaco are moving some personnel out of their field </p><p>operations in the </p><p>delta swamps, primarily out of concern that they will be </p><p>caught in the </p><p>crossfire.  The situation in the area remains volatile and </p><p>very fluid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) At the time of the discussion between Econoff and the </p><p>ExxonMobil executive, </p><p>Shell\'s estimated reduction in output was 30,000 bpd, what </p><p>the executive </p><p>described as a "drop in the bucket."  When pressed, he said </p><p>industry watchers </p><p>should begin to worry if Nigeria\'s overall production drops </p><p>by 100,000 bpd over </p><p>a sustained period.  He also noted that Nigeria\'s current </p><p>maximum production </p><p>effort is matched throughout OPEC.  He said that OPEC-wide, </p><p>it would be hard to </p><p>pull an additional half-million barrels of crude at this </p><p>time, except perhaps </p><p>from Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment.  The GON normally allocates its OPEC quota </p><p>among each of the oil </p><p>producers doing business here.  In the past, whenever any </p><p>given company\'s </p><p>production levels have been reduced by equipment failure or </p><p>community action, </p><p>as in the case of the take-over by local women of </p><p>ChevronTexaco\'s Escravos in the summer of 2002, the GON has </p><p>quickly reallocated the anticipated </p><p>production loss to other producers in order to maintain </p><p>overall national output </p><p>levels.  If OPEC quotas are being ignored at this time to </p><p>maximize worldwide </p><p>production, and Nigerian producers are operating at full </p><p>capacity, sustained </p><p>field operation disruptions may begin to have an effect on </p><p>output as the GON </p><p>has nowhere to turn to pick up the slack.  A small producer </p><p>told Econoff that </p><p>his company is still operating at only 35 percent capacity </p><p>under GON quotas. </p><p>It may be that if disruptions in the Delta or elsewhere </p><p>continue, companies </p><p>operating marginal fields will also be asked to operate at </p><p>maximum capacity, </p><p>making every drop of crude truly count. End comment. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
