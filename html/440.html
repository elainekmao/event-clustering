<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 MOSCOW 00219 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/S PLEASE PASS TO EUR/SOV VERSHBOW ASAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DEC;:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINT, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  TAKEOVER OF PRESS BUILDINGS IN RIGA AND VILNIUS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  LENINGRAD 6998 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>/------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  LATVIAN AND LITHUANIAN SPOKESMEN CONFIRMED PRESS </p><p>REPORTS THAT SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY (MVD) SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES HAVE TAKEN OVER THE MAIN PRESS BUILDING IN RIGA </p><p>AND ARE OCCUPYING THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LITHUANIAN </p><p>BRANCH OF THE CPSU IN VILNIUS, REPORTEDLY AT THE </p><p>LATTER\'S REQUEST.  ONE JOURNALIST WAS BEATEN WHEN HE </p><p>TRIED TO STAGE A SIT-DOWN STRIKE IN THE BUILDING AND </p><p>ANOTHER EVICTED BODILY, BUT NO OTHER REPORTS OF </p><p>INJURIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.  THE OCCUPATION OF THE </p><p>PRESS BUILDING BRINGS TO A HEAD A LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE </p><p>BETWEEN THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE </p><p>SMALL BUT VOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY ALLIED WITH SOVIET </p><p>MILITARY FORCES STATIONED IN THE REPUBLIC AND SOVIET </p><p>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR SPECIAL FORCES.  IT IS STILL NOT </p><p>CLEAR WHO IS CALLING THE TUNE THOUGH:  THE COMMANDER OF </p><p>THE INTERIOR MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS IN LATVIA </p><p>ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY THAT </p><p>THE OCCUPATION OF THE PRESS BUILDING OCCURED WITHOUT </p><p>HIS KNOWLEDGE OR APPROVAL.  THE COMMANDER OF SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES IN LITHUANIA SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE </p><p>TAKEOVER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY BUILDING THERE.  USSR </p><p>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR CONTACTS IN MOSCOW PROVIDED NO </p><p>INFORMATION OR CLARIFICATION ON THE ACTIONS OF TROOPS </p><p>IN RIGA AND VILNIUS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SITUATION IN RIGA IS VERY TENSE, AND THE </p><p>LATVIAN LEADERSHIP IS IN MOSCOW TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>SITUATION.  LATVIAN PRESIDENT GORBUNOVS IS MEETING WITH </p><p>GORBACHEV AT 3:00, AND OTHER LATVIAN OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>MEETING WITH USSR MILITARY AND INTERIOR MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS.  THE LITHUANIAN REPRESENTATIVE IN MOSCOW </p><p>APPEARED LESS WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN VILNIUS, </p><p>BUT SAID PRIME MINISTER PRUNSKIENE HAD CUT SHORT A </p><p>VISIT TO AUSTRALIA AND WAS BACK IN VILNIUS FOR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  EMBASSY </p><p>BELIEVES IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR DEPARTMENT PRESS </p><p>SPOKESPERSON TO CALL FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>INCIDENTS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TAKEOVER OF LATVIAN PRESS BUILDING NOT UNEXPECTED </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  LATVIAN PREMREP PRESS SPOKESMAN ARIS JARSONS </p><p>PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON THE TAKEOVER BY </p><p>WHAT APPEAR TO BE SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES (SPETSNAZ) TROOPS OF THE MAIN PRESS BUILDING IN </p><p>RIGA.  THE BUILDING AND PRINTING ENTERPRISE IT HOUSES </p><p>FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY, BUT FOLLOWING </p><p>A LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET DECREE IN DECEMBER, IT WAS </p><p>AUTHORIZED TO BE TURNED INTO AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>WORKER-OWNED JOINT STOCK VENTURE, WITH 20` OF THE STOCK </p><p>TO REMAIN IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S HANDS. SHORTLY </p><p>THEREAFTER, A SMALL NUMBER OF SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY </p><p>FORCES BEGAN TO TAKE UP POSITIONS IN THE BUILDING, BUT </p><p>DID NOT INTEREFERE WITH THE WORKINGS.  ON NEW YEAR\'S </p><p>EVE, LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ALFRED RUBIKS </p><p>APPEARED ON LATVIAN TELEVISION TO PROTEST THE JOINT </p><p>STOCK VENTURE, WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS </p><p>"EXPROPRIATION", AND WARNED THAT "SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>PAY" FOR THIS.  THE FOLLOWING NIGHT (JANUARY 1-2), A </p><p>LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIAL FORCES ARMED WITH AUTOMATIC </p><p>WEAPONS TOOK CONTROL OF THE PRESS BUILDING, SURROUNDED </p><p>THE DIRECTOR DUDNURS, AND PREVENTED HIM FROM ISSUING </p><p>ANY ORDERS TO THE WORKERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WORKERS REMAINED IN THE BUILDING THROUGH THE </p><p>MORNING OF JANUARY 2, WHILE A LARGE CROWED ESTIMATED IN </p><p>THE THOUSANDS, ACCORDING TO JARSONS, GATHERED OUTSIDE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE MVD TROOPS DID NOT INITIALLY TRY TO EVICT </p><p>THE WORKERS, THEY BEGAN TO GET TOUGHER DURING THE </p><p>COURSE OF THE DAY.  THEY BODILY EVICTED ONE JOURNALIST </p><p>AND BEAT UP ANOTHER WHO TRIED TO ORGANIZE A SIT-DOWN </p><p>STRIKE.  MOREOVER THEY ALLEGEDLY TURNED THEIR MACHINE </p><p>GUNS ON VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL </p><p>DAINIS IVANS WHO SHOWED UP AT THE PRESS BUILDING </p><p>SHORTLY BEFORE NOON, AND TRIED TO ENTER THE BUILDING </p><p>DISPLAYING HIS DEPUTY\'S CREDENTIALS.  NO OTHER REPORTS </p><p>OF INJURIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.  SOVIET SPECIAL FORCES </p><p>NOW OCCUPY EVERY FLOOR OF THE PRESS BUILDING, AND ARE </p><p>PREVENTING LATVIANS FROM ENTERING.  THERE ARE STILL </p><p>CROWDS MILLING IN FRONT OF THE PRESS BUILDING AND THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE REMAINS STRONG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHO GAVE THE ORDER? </p><p>/----------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED NO OFFICIAL </p><p>EXPLANATION FOR THE TAKEOVER OF THE BUILDING, ACCORDING </p><p>TO JARSONS.  THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL CHAIRMAN </p><p>SUMMONED THE COMMANDER OF SOVIET MVD SPECIAL FORCES, TO </p><p>RIGA ON JANUARY 2 FOR AN EXPLANATION.  THE LATTER </p><p>REPORTEDLY SAID THAT THE TAKEOVER WAS CARRIED OUT </p><p>WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT, AND HE REFERRED ALL </p><p>QUESTIONS "TO MOSCOW".  THE LITHUANIAN PERMREP IN </p><p>MOSCOW REPORTED A SIMILAR RESPONSE TO HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO GET AN EXPLANATION OF THE SPECIAL FORCES </p><p>OCCUPATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY BUILDING IN VILNIUS. </p><p>THE COMMANDER OF THE SPECIAL FORCES REPORTEDLY TOLD THE </p><p>LITHUANIAN LEADERSHIP THAT THE ACTION WAS TAKEN WITHOUT </p><p>HIS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE.  IN ADDITION, EMBASSY\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO CONTACT THE USSR MINISTRY OF INTERIOR FOR </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF INTERIOR MINISTER PUGO\'S REPORTED </p><p>REMARKS THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE INCIDENT IN RIGA AND </p><p>HAD NOT AUTHORIZED THE USE OF SPECIAL TROOPS WERE </p><p>UNAVAILING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GORBUNOV TO MEET GORBACHEV TODAY </p><p>/------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE LATVIAN LEADERSHIP FLEW TO TO MOSCOW TO TRY TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE SITUATION.  PRESIDENT OF THE LATVIAN </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL GORBUNOVS HAD A 3:00 PM MOSCOW TIME </p><p>MEETING WITH GORBACHEV.  PRIME MINISTER GODMANIS IS </p><p>MEETING WITH GENERAL MOISEYEV, AND OTHER SENIOR LATVIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE MEETING WITH INTERIOR MINISTER PUGO TO </p><p>DEFUSE THE CURRENT SITUATION.  THE TAKEOVER OF THE </p><p>PRESS BUILDING IN RIGA CULMINATES MONTHS OF GROWING </p><p>TENSION IN THE CAPITAL AND FEARS BY THE LATVIAN AND </p><p>OTHER BALTIC GOVERNMENTS THAT THE USSR WOULD RESORT TO </p><p>MILITARY FORCE OR DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL RULE -- INCLUDING </p><p>REPLACEMENT OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENTS BY OFFICIALS </p><p>SUBSERVIENT TO MOSCOW -- TO FORCE THE BALTICS TO ABJURE </p><p>THEIR INDEPENDENCE CLAIMS.  IN LATVIA, THE DISPUTE HAS </p><p>PITTED THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE ONE SIDE, AGAINST </p><p>THE SMALL BUT VOCAL LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ALLIED WITH </p><p>LOCAL SOVIET MILITARY COMMANDERS AND SOVIET INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES.  THE DISPUTE WAS FUELED BY THE </p><p>DECISION OF THE BALTIC DISTRICT MILITARY COMMANDER TO </p><p>HOLD THE NOVEMBER 7 MILITARY PARADE IN RIGA, DESPITE </p><p>THE EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL. </p><p>THE LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET RESPONDED WITH A NOVEMBER 14 </p><p>DECREE ANNOUNCING THAT THE REPUBLIC WOULD NO LONGER </p><p>PROVIDE MATERIAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO SOVIET FORCES </p><p>STATIONED ON ITS TERRITORY, AND RESTRICTING THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>THE DECREE PROVOKED A STRONG REACTION FROM MOSCOW: </p><p>GORBACHEV SINGLED IT OUT FOR CRITICISM IN HIS NOVEMBER </p><p>15 SUPREME SOVIET SPEECH, AND SOME LATVIAN DEPUTIES </p><p>CLAIM IT WAS A MAJOR FACTOR BEHIND GORBACHEV\'S DECISION </p><p>TO GIVE THE MILITARY GREATER LEEWAY TO DEAL WITH </p><p>ATTACKS ON THEIR FORCES IN THE REPUBLICS (YAZOV\'S </p><p>NOVEMBER    SPEECH).  ALTHOUGH THE DECREE HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>PUT INTO EFFECT, AND HAS NO LEGAL STATUS BECAUSE </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL PRESIDENT GORBUNOVS REFUSED TO SIGN IT, </p><p>IT HAS NEVERTHELESS BECOME A MAJOR SOURCE OF IRRITATION </p><p>BETWEEN MOSCOW AND RIGA, ACCORDING TO BOTH SOVIET AND </p><p>LATVIAN SOURCES.  MOREOVER, A SERIES OF FIREBOMBINGS IN </p><p>THE REPUBLIC, ALTERNATING BETWEEN SOVIET MILITARY OR </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY FACILITIES AND LATVIAN NATIONAL </p><p>MONUMENTS (REF A) HAS ALSO HEIGHTENED TENSIONS OVER THE </p><p>SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REPUBLIC.  ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>ONE HAS BEEN HURT SO FAR, THE REPUBLIC LEADERSHIP, </p><p>ACCORDING TO PETERS, IS CONCERNED THAT THE INCIDENTS </p><p>ARE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES </p><p>AND COULD PROVOKE GORBACHEV TO IMPOSE PRESIDENTIAL RULE </p><p>IN THE REPUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LATVIA PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS ON STATUS OF FORCES </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 18, LATVIAN PERMREP IN MOSCOW JANIS PETERS </p><p>(PROTECT) WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET </p><p>TO PROPOSE TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATIONS ON A </p><p>STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT ON SOVIET TROOPS STATIONED </p><p>IN LATVIA.  HE TOLD EMBOFF THAT HE MET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL MEMBER YAKOVLEV, WHO PROMISED TO </p><p>CONVEY THE PROPOSAL TO GORBACHEV.  YAKOVLEV NEVER </p><p>PROVIDED A FORMAL SOVIET RESPONSE TO THE LATVIAN </p><p>OFFER.  HOWEVER, IN A CORRIDOR CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF </p><p>DURING THE FOURTH CONGRESS OF PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES IN LATE </p><p>DECEMBER, PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL MEMBER GRIGORIY REVENKO </p><p>(PROTECT) TOLD EMBOFF THAT THE LATVIAN PROPOSAL WAS NOT </p><p>WITHOUT MERIT, BUT THAT SUCH TALKS COULD ONLY TAKE </p><p>PLACE AFTER THE REFERENDUM ON THE TREATY OF THE UNION. </p><p>REVENKO ASSERTED THAT BALTIC ASSERTIONS THAT THE USSR </p><p>WOULD IMPOSE PRESIDENTIAL RULE IN THE REPUBLICS WAS </p><p>PURELY POLITICAL PRESSURE TACTICS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LITHUANIANS SOMEWHAT LESS CONCERNED </p><p>/---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>LITHUANIAN PERMREP IN MOSCOW BICKAUSKAS (PROTECT) </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT WHAT APPEAR TO BE SOVIET INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES HAVE ALSO OCCUPIED THE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN VILNIUS, </p><p>REPORTEDLY AT THE LATTER\'S REQUEST, AND FORCED OUT THE </p><p>LITHUANIAN MILITIA.  BICKAUSKAS, WHO RETURNED FROM </p><p>VILNIUS YESTERDAY, SAID THAT THE COMMANDER OF SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES REPORTEDLY TOLD THE REPUBLIC\'S LEADERSHIP THAT </p><p>THAT THE OCCUPATION WAS CARRIED OUT WITHOUT HIS </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. </p><p> </p><p>BICKAUSKAS, WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT </p><p>THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WAS PLANNING TO IMPOSE ANOTHER </p><p>ECONOMIC BLOCKADE OR DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL RULE, </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT THE SITUATION IN VILNIUS "SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>OVERLY DRAMATIZED".  THE LITHUANIAN SUPREME COUNCIL IS </p><p>MEETING TO DECIDE WHAT STEPS TO TAKE, BUT DID NOT FEEL </p><p>THAT THE SITUATION WAS AT A CRISIS STAGE, AND HAD NO </p><p>PLANS TO SEND REPRESENTATIVES TO MOSCOW TO TALK TO THE </p><p>SOVIET LEADERSHIP.  NEVERTHELESS, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>PRUNSKIENE CUT SHORT A VISIT TO AUSTRALIA TO RETURN TO </p><p>VILNIUS.  BICKAUSKAS WAS CALLED ON HIS DIRECT LINE TO </p><p>THE KREMLIN TO ATTEND THE 3:00 MEETING WITH GORBACHEV, </p><p>BUT DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY </p><p>VILNIUS TO ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>/------ </p><p> </p><p>THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO ITS SPOKESMAN, </p><p>APPEARS TO BE MOST ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>EVENTS GETTING OUT OF HAND, AND IS CLEARLY DETERMINED </p><p>TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM AT WHAT IT BELIEVES TO BE THE </p><p>SOURCE -- MOSCOW.  WHETHER THE EVENTS IN RIGA HAVE BEEN </p><p>ORCHESTRATED FROM MOSCOW OR NOT, THERE IS A REAL RISK </p><p>OF GROWING VIOLENCE WHICH WILL NOT BE AMENABLE TO </p><p>PEACEFUL RESOLUTION.  WE, THEREFORE, SUGGEST THAT THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON MAKE A STATEMENT URGING THAT </p><p>THE SITUATION BE RESOLVED BY MEANS OF TALKS WITHOUT </p><p>RESORT TO VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
