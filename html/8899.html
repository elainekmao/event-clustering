<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001440 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, DS/OP/NEA, DS/DSS, DS/ITA, </p><p>DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD, CJTF HOA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: ATTACK ON ROYG MEDICAL ASSISTANCE CONVOY IN ABYAN </p><p>GOVERNORATE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b </p><p>,d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  Summary:  A ROYG-protected medical assistance </p><p>convoy was attacked by unknown forces in Abyan governorate on </p><p>June 21.  Reports of deaths and injuries differ, with the </p><p>highest estimate at five dead.  No Amcits or other foreigners </p><p>were involved.  The motive for the attack is yet unknown, and </p><p>no one has claimed responsibility.  Embassy will continue to </p><p>seek further information.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  The PSO has provided additional information on </p><p>the attack that will be reported via ORCA channels. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>What We Know -- Where and When </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  All sources agree that the attack occurred on a </p><p>medical assistance convoy traveling in the Sarar district in </p><p>Abyan governorate in the early afternoon of June 21.  This </p><p>area of Abyan governorate, to the northeast of Aden, is </p><p>well-known as an area in which the recently dormant </p><p>Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA) has occasionally operated in </p><p>the past. The convoy consisted of two vehicles, both with Red </p><p>Crescent markings and Defense Ministry license plates, with </p><p>approximately seven Yemeni military medical personnel heading </p><p>to Sarar to provide humanitarian assistance. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>What We Cannot Confirm -- </p><p>Details/Results of Attack, Who and Why </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Most reports indicate an attack by rocket </p><p>propelled grenades and AK-47s by an unknown number of </p><p>assailants.  DMI sources told DATT that both RPGs and </p><p>explosives were used.  Reports of deaths and injured differ. </p><p>Ministry of Interior told RSO that seven were injured but </p><p>none dead, and PSO contacts told Pol/Mil a similar story. </p><p>However, DMI contacts told DATT that five were killed, which </p><p>concurs with what the Governor of Abyan told the PSO liaison </p><p>to Force Protection Detachment (FDP) Chief, who was in Aden. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The identity and motivation of the attackers remains </p><p>unconfirmed.   PSO liaison told the FPD Chief that the </p><p>Governor of Abyan presumed it was remnants of the AAIA who </p><p>attacked the convoy, believing it was about to attack them. </p><p>AP correspondent Ahmed al-Haj (please protect) told Pol FSN </p><p>that his sources said the attackers numbered about 20 and </p><p>were remnants of the AAIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Press Reports </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Official government daily al-Thawra reported on the </p><p>attack, quoting an official source at the Ministry of </p><p>Interior to Saba news agency.  The source said, "yesterday at </p><p>about 11 am, and while a group of Yemeni doctors and their </p><p>assistants belonging to the military medical services was </p><p>providing medical services to the citizens in the region of </p><p>Habban of Sarar district, Abyan governorate, a group of armed </p><p>persons fired on the doctors\' vehicles and their assistants </p><p>which resulted in the injury of seven persons, a doctor, five </p><p>assistants and the driver...."  The source indicated that </p><p>security forces are tracking down the criminals to bring them </p><p>to justice.  The Ministry of Interior urges citizens to </p><p>cooperate with the security forces "to seize these criminals </p><p>who committed this awful act by attacking people who are </p><p>rendering humanitarian medical services to citizens." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Independent newspaper al-Ayyam reported the </p><p>statement above, adding another statement from the local </p><p>council in Sarar district.  The statement condemns the </p><p>"criminal terrorist act" and says the presence of these </p><p>groups (the perpetrators) in this region is strange.  It also </p><p>said that "these groups camped in the area. . .prior to the </p><p>parliamentary elections of this year, and they were carrying </p><p>out some provocative acts, firing on vehicles and tearing </p><p>down pictures of candidates." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The attack was not directed at Amcits or other </p><p>foreigners, and occurred in a remote area previously </p><p>associated with violent acts by the AAIA.  While there is no </p><p>basis for viewing this as the opening of a new campaign </p><p>rather than an isolated incident, the attack could </p><p>nevertheless have implications for overall security in Yemen. </p><p> Yemeni authorities have been forthcoming with information, </p><p>and Post will continue to follow events closely.  End Comment. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
