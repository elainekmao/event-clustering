(SBU) The Ambassador discussed the status of the </p><p>UAE\'s Federal Customs Authority (FCA) with Finance </p><p>Minstate Dr. Muhammad Khalfan bin Khirbash (the de </p><p>facto Finance Minister) on March 18.  Dr. Khirbash </p><p>stated that while the legislation creating the Federal </p><p>Customs Authority has been passed -- and the authority </p><p>has even held its first meeting under the leadership </p><p>of the nominal chair, Hamdan bin Rashad Al-Maktoum </p><p>(the nominal Finance Minister) -- no federal customs </p><p>law has been enacted which would lay out with </p><p>precision the powers of the FCA.  It had been agreed </p><p>by the individual emirates that the FCA would be </p><p>responsible for overseeing the collection of fees </p><p>resulting from the GCC Customs Union, and for </p><p>maintaining a UAE-wide list of products to be exempted </p><p>from these duties.  But until legislation is passed </p><p>(most likely by June of this year), the FCA\'s powers </p><p>are very limited.  Dr. Khirbash said it would take </p><p>several months after the passage of this implementing </p><p>legislation for the FCA to become fully effective. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: The UAE is strongly committed to </p><p>the GCC customs union but, because of its unique </p><p>confederal nature, faces distinctive challenges in </p><p>developing an effective federal structure to oversee </p><p>what is primarily, according to the UAE constitution, </p><p>an Emirate-level responsibility. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
