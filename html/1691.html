<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, KISL, KIRL </p><p>SUBJECT: SHARIA IN ZAMFARA--A NEW LOW </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 215 (B) ABUJA 424 (C) 00 ABUJA 419 (D) </p><p>     ABUJA 405 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary: Governor Ahmed Sani on May 3 permitted the </p><p>second hand-amputation since the return of criminal Sharia in </p><p>Zamfara State in February, 2000.  The victim had been </p><p>convicted of stealing three bicycles in July 2000, and the </p><p>sentence had been held in abeyance since that time.  The </p><p>timing of the amputation, almost one year after the </p><p>conviction, makes the decision to go forward appear </p><p>politically motivated.  Many Nigerian Muslims--including </p><p>those who support criminal Sharia--have expressed outrage </p><p>over the cavalier and politicized approach to Sharia </p><p>punishments in Zamfara, but fear criticizing the </p><p>wildly-popular Sani publicly.  At this point, Zamfara\'s </p><p>indigent citizens are subject to the most extreme type of </p><p>Sharia penalties, which are enforced by political judges </p><p>lacking adequate training in Sharia jurisprudence.  Unlike </p><p>their co-religionists in other countries living under Islamic </p><p>criminal law, Muslims in Zamfara State do not even benefit </p><p>from the defenses and procedures required by classical Sharia </p><p>doctrine--which usually make a sentence of amputation nearly </p><p>impossible to carry out.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The personal physician to Governor Sani, Dr. Bello </p><p>Buzu, amputated the hand of convicted bicycle thief Lawal Isa </p><p>on Thursday, May 3.  Isa had been convicted of stealing three </p><p>bicycles by the Upper Sharia Court in the Gummi Local </p><p>Government Area of rural Zamfara State on July 7, 2000. </p><p>While Sani told Poloff nearly one year ago that there would </p><p>be "no more" amputations in Zamfara, and that he would abide </p><p>by an informal agreement with the Executive to set aside </p><p>those sentences, conditions appear now to have changed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  This case, along with the amputation of Buba Jangebe </p><p>for cattle rustling and the flogging of 14-year-old Bariya </p><p>Magazu for alleged fonication in January, defines the state </p><p>of Sharia jurisprudence in Zamfara State (Ref. A).  While </p><p>other states (like Sokoto) have had alkali judges pronounce </p><p>amputation sentences, these have all been set aside either on </p><p>formal appeal or by executive review.  Zamfara\'s politicized </p><p>Sharia punishments continue to be focused on the most </p><p>defenseless of its citizens, while the well-known misdeeds of </p><p>Zamfara\'s political elite--including some recently dismissed </p><p>Sharia judges--go unpunished.  Sharia "Hadd" punishments, </p><p>such as amputation, are intended to be imposed only in </p><p>extremely rare cases (Pakistan has not had an amputation </p><p>since it introduced Sharia law in 1979).  In Zamfara, </p><p>however, they appear to be used to advance purely political </p><p>interests.  Many Muslim Nigerians--including those who </p><p>support some version of criminal Sharia--are outraged over </p><p>the brazenly political manipulation of their tradition, and </p><p>at the lack of either Constitutional or traditional Sharia </p><p>protections afforded Zamfara,s Muslims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Comment:  The timing of this amputation may not have </p><p>been co-incidental.  It was performed immediately prior to </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s trip to the U.S., one week after the </p><p>USCIRF released its Religious Freedom Report (which was </p><p>critical of Zamfara0, and four days after Muslim </p><p>fundamentalist Ibrahim Zakzaky publicly described Sharia in </p><p>Zamfara as being a sham.  Some Nigerian contacts have </p><p>suggested that when foreign human rights institutions begin </p><p>focusing on Sharia, pressure mounts among Zamfara\'s Sharia </p><p>zealots for Governor Sani to prove that he is serious about </p><p>Sharia.  President Obasanjo\'s desire for re-election, and his </p><p>growing unpopularity in the North--considered largely </p><p>responsible for his victory in 1999--may also have led </p><p>Governor Sani to feel the he could allow another amputation </p><p>with impunity.  Sani is also playing to his foreign audience </p><p>of supporters, which include, as he admitted informally to </p><p>Poloff last year, Iranians, Iraqis and Libyans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Comment continued: The political manipulation of </p><p>Sharia in Zamfara has created an environment in which its </p><p>Muslim citizens, human rights can be arbitrarily violated. </p><p>It is also useful to compare Sharia as it is being practiced </p><p>in Zamfara to Islamic criminal jurisdictions elsewhere in the </p><p>world.  From the way these three cases have been handled, it </p><p>can be conclusively said that defendants facing "hadd" Sharia </p><p>punishments in Zamfara are afforded fewer of the classical </p><p>Sharia procedural protections and substantive defenses than </p><p>their co-religionists in Pakistan, Libya, Iran or even the </p><p>Sudan.  Half-baked and hastily adopted, Zamfara\'s version of </p><p>political Sharia is not only bad from the human rights </p><p>perspective, it is also bad Sharia. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
