CONFIDENTIAL  -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>/------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A MAY 13-16 TRIP TO ARMENIA: </p><p> </p><p>--ARMENIAN OFFICIALS DESCRIBED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OTHER FIVE REPUBLICS EXCLUDED FROM </p><p>THE NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>--ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN TER-PETROSYAN </p><p>(PROTECT) SAID ARMENIA INTENDED TO PURSUE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MECHANISMS STIPULATED BY SOVIET LAW. </p><p> </p><p>--THE RESIGNATION OF ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF </p><p>POGOSYAN REFLECTED THE DISILLUSIONMENT OF ARMENIAN </p><p>COMMUNISTS WITH THE CPSU. </p><p> </p><p>--TER-PETROSYAN DESCRIBED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET </p><p>MILITARY TO ALLOW ARMENIAN CITIZENS TO SERVE ONLY IN </p><p>ARMENIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS IS THE THIRD OF THREE REPORTS ON THE TRIP.  THE </p><p>FIRST REPORT COVERED ARMENIA\'S DISPUTE WITH AZERBAYDZHAN </p><p>(REF A).  THE SECOND ANALYZED ARMENIA\'S FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>(SEPTEL).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE SIX VERSUS THE NINE-PLUS-ONE </p><p>/------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  DURING A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFFS, ARMENIAN SUPREME </p><p>SOVIET CHAIRMAN LEVON TER-PETROSYAN STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>APRIL 23 SO-CALLED NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION WAS ONLY A </p><p>TACTICAL AND PROPAGANDA STEP WITH NO REAL MEANING. </p><p>TER-PETROSYAN SAID THAT KAZAKHSTAN PRESIDENT NAZARBAYEV </p><p>HAD BROACHED THE IDEA ORIGINALLY IN COUNCIL OF THE </p><p>FEDERATION MEETINGS EARLY THIS YEAR.  THE ARMENIAN LEADER </p><p>SAID GORBACHEV NEEDED SUCH AN AGREEMENT GOING INTO THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY PLENUM AND YEL\'TSIN, AT THAT POINT, </p><p>NEEDED TO SHOW HE WAS WILLING TO COMPROMISE TO SAVE THE </p><p>UNION.  TER-PETROSYAN ADDED THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE </p><p>THE REPUBLICS WOULD NOT SIGN THE LATEST UNION TREATY </p><p>DRAFT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TER-PETROSYAN OBSERVED THAT UKRAINE SPEARHEADED THE </p><p>GROUP OF REPUBLICS WHICH PRESENTED THE GREATEST CHALLENGE </p><p>TO THE CENTER.  TER-PETROSYAN INDICATED THAT DURING THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF THE FEDERATION MEETINGS, UKRAINIAN LEADER </p><p>KRAVCHUK WAS THE MOST ADAMANT ABOUT REDUCING THE CENTER\'S </p><p>POWERS VIS-A-VIS THE CENTER.  BECAUSE UKRAINE IS A VERY </p><p>RICH AND POWERFUL REPUBLIC, KRAVCHUK IS SURE TO HAVE A </p><p>MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE UNION </p><p>TREATY NEGOTIATIONS, ACCORDING TO TER-PETROSYAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TER-PETROSYAN TOLD POLOFFS THAT SIX MONTHS AGO, </p><p>MOLDAVIAN PRESIDENT MIRCHA SNEGUR INTRODUCED A PLAN FOR </p><p>COOPERATION AMONG THE SIX REPUBLICS WHICH HAD NO </p><p>INTENTION OF SIGNING THE UNION TREATY.  THESE INCLUDE THE </p><p>THREE BALTIC REPUBLICS, GEORGIA, MOLDOVA, AND ARMENIA. </p><p>AT THAT TIME THESE REPUBLICS HAD A STRONG SENSE THAT THE </p><p>CENTER WOULD IMPLEMENT PUNITIVE MEASURES TO KEEP THEM IN </p><p>THE UNION.  ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER HOVANES IGITYAN (PROTECT) HAD JUST </p><p>RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO MOLDOVA AND WAS PREPARING TO </p><p>LEAVE FOR THE BALTICS THE NEXT DAY TO CONTINUE THESE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  IGITYAN IS THE WORKING-LEVEL ARMENIAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FORMULATION OF COUNTERMEASURES TO </p><p>ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE THE NINE MAY TRY TO INFLICT </p><p>ON THESE SIX REPUBLICS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IGITYAN INDICATED THAT THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD BECOME </p><p>MORE FREQUENT SINCE THE APRIL 23 SIGNING OF THE </p><p>NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION.  HE ADDED THAT THE LEADERS OF </p><p>THE SIX REPUBLICS HAD NOT YET MET BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN </p><p>BUSY WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>REPUBLICS.  (COMMENT:  BALTIC CONTACTS HAVE TOLD US THAT </p><p>BALTIC LEADERS ARE WARY OF ANY TYPE OF FORMAL AGREEMENT </p><p>AMONG THE SIX BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WISH TO DILUTE THEIR </p><p>ARGUMENTS FOR INDEPENDENCE BY INCLUDING REPUBLICS WHOSE </p><p>INCORPORATION IS ACCEPTED BY THE WEST.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  TER-PETROSYAN MAINTAINED THAT ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST THE SIX REPUBLICS WOULD BE VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE </p><p>SOVIET ECONOMIC SYSTEM.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE CLOSE </p><p>ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE REPUBLICS WOULD MAKE IT VERY </p><p>HARD FOR THE CENTER OR THE NINE REPUBLICS TO TAKE ACTION </p><p>WITHOUT SUFFERING RETALIATION.  THUS, HE CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>SUCH ECONOMIC PRESSURE WOULD BACKFIRE ON THE CENTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A LEGAL PATH TO INDEPENDENCE </p><p>/--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  TER-PETROSYAN OUTLINED FOR POLOFFS HIS VISION OF THE </p><p>PATH TO ARMENIA\'S INDEPENDENCE.  FIRST, ARMENIA INTENDED </p><p>TO FOLLOW THE USSR SUPREME SOVIET LAW ON SECESSION.  THIS </p><p>PROCESS WILL BEGIN WITH THE SEPTEMBER 21 REPUBLIC </p><p>REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE.  SOON AFTER, ARMENIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS PLAN TO HOLD REPUBLIC ELECTIONS.  AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, THE NEW REPUBLIC SUPREME SOVIET WILL DRAFT A </p><p>NEW CONSTITUTION.  FINALLY, THE REPUBLIC WILL COMPLETE </p><p>THE FINAL STAGES FOR COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION.  TER-PETROSYAN AND ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMISSION CHAIRMAN VARDANIYAN </p><p>(PROTECT) COULD NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE PROCESS COULD TAKE A LONG TIME. </p><p>TER-PETROSYAN MAINTAINED THAT ARMENIA\'S CHOICE TO FOLLOW </p><p>THE LEGAL ROUTE TO INDEPENDENCE HAD UPSET THE CENTER AND </p><p>THEREFORE THE CENTER EXACERBATED THE </p><p>ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI DISPUTE (REF A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARMENIAN COMMUNISTS DISILLUSIONED </p><p>/-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ACCORDING TO SEVERAL ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF </p><p>STEFAN POGOSYAN RESIGNED ON MAY 13 BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO </p><p>COLLUDE WITH THE CENTER AGAINST THE ARMENIANS.  LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SERZHIK DOVLADBEGYAN (PROTECT) TOLD </p><p>POLOFFS POGOSYAN HAD RESIGNED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ASKED </p><p>TO FORM A NATIONAL SALVATION COMMITTEE IN ARMENIA TO WORK </p><p>AGAINST THE ARMENIAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT.  KAMU </p><p>KOCHARYAN (PROTECT), ANOTHER LOCAL OFFICIAL, SAID </p><p>POGOSYAN RESIGNED BECAUSE "HE DID NOT WANT TO BETRAY HIS </p><p>PEOPLE."  OTHER OFFICIALS TOLD US THE LAST STRAW FOR </p><p>POGOSYAN WAS WHEN HE ASKED GORBACHEV FOR A MEETING TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE DEPORTATION OF GETASHEN AND MARTUNASHEN (REF </p><p>A) AND WAS REFUSED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DZHEMA ANANYAN (PROTECT), FORMERLY A VERY ACTIVE </p><p>ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST AND MEMBER OF THE USSR </p><p>CPSU CONTROL COMMISSION, EMBODIED THE BITTERNESS LOCAL </p><p>COMMUNISTS FEEL TOWARD THE CPSU AND THE CENTER.  RUBEN </p><p>SHUGAROV (PROTECT), AN ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET STAFFER, </p><p>TOLD POLOFFS THAT ANANYAN HAD BEEN A STRONG COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY STALWART IN ARMENIA AND HAS SPENT MOST OF HER </p><p>CAREER ESPOUSING COMMUNIST PARTY IDEOLOGY AND IDEALS. </p><p>12.  WHEN POLOFFS MET ANANYAN ON MAY 15 IN HER OFFICE IN </p><p>THE ARMENIAN BORDER CITY OF IDZHEVAN, SHE EXUDED </p><p>BITTERNESS AND DISGUST TOWARD THE CENTER AND THE CPSU. </p><p>SHE ACCUSED THE CENTER OF CONDUCTING "A CAMPAIGN OF STATE </p><p>TERROR AGAINST THE ARMENIANS."  SHE ADDED, "I HAVE BEEN A </p><p>LOYAL AND DEDICATED COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL FOR 40 YEARS </p><p>AND THIS IS HOW THEY TREAT US|"  SHE SHOWED POLOFFS A </p><p>COPY OF HER PUBLISHED STATEMENT IN WHICH SHE RESIGNED </p><p>FROM THE CPSU CONTROL COMMISSION AND AIRED HER DISGUST </p><p>WITH THE CENTER\'S SUPPORT OF AZERBAYDZHAN AND THE </p><p>SHELLING OF VILLAGES ALONG THE ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI </p><p>BORDER.  SHE ALSO REFLECTED THAT "IT IS STRANGE THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD GIVE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE TO A MAN WHO WOULD </p><p>CONDUCT THIS KIND OF TERROR CAMPAIGN." </p><p> </p><p>ARMENIAN DRAFTEES TO SERVE ONLY IN ARMENIA? </p><p>/------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID ARMENIAN OFFICIALS ARE ENGAGED IN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET ARMY OVER THE STATUS OF </p><p>ARMENIA\'S DRAFTEES AND WHERE THEY WILL SERVE.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE DRAFT AGREEMENT WITH THE SOVIET ARMY, ARMENIA </p><p>WOULD CONCLUDE ITS OWN AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER REPUBLICS </p><p>ABOUT WHERE SOLDIERS WOULD SERVE.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID </p><p>THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF CONCLUDING SUCH AN AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH LITHUANIA, FOR EXAMPLE.  THE ARMENIAN LEADER SAID </p><p>THE PLAN HAS THE BLESSING OF USSR DEFENSE MINISTER YAZOV </p><p>AND ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES, WHO HAS JUST BEEN IN ARMENIA TO </p><p>FINALIZE THE AGREEMENT.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID THAT ARMENIA </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY GIVEN THEIR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>RUSSIAN TROOPS.  HE SAID THAT IN 1918 AND 1942, RUSSIAN </p><p>SOLDIERS HAD ABANDONED ARMENIA TO THE ENEMY AND HAD NOT </p><p>DEFENDED THE REPUBLIC AGAINST HOSTILE FORCES.  "WITH OUR </p><p>OWN PART OF THE ARMY STAFFED BY ARMENIANS, THIS WOULD NOT </p><p>HAPPEN," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>14.  TER-PETROSAN ALSO TOLD POLOFFS THAT THE ARMENIAN </p><p>SUPREME SOVIET HAD RECENTLY CREATED AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH </p><p>DEFENSE COMMISSION, WHICH WOULD COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF SOVIET ARMY, USSR MVD, ARMENIAN MVD, CIVIL DEFENSE, </p><p>VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY AND </p><p>AIR FORCE (DOSAAF), AND KGB TROOPS IN ARMENIA. </p><p>TER-PETROSYAN SAID HIS GOALS WERE TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS, TO STRENGTHEN THE MILITIA, AND </p><p>PROTECT THE REPUBLIC\'S BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
