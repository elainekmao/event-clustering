<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KGLB, SENV, MV, CE, OEXC - Exchanges, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT: GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to </p><p>Benefit the Environment) Program Update: Sri Lanka </p><p>and Maldives </p><p> </p><p>REF:  State 06351 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Below is the GLOBE program update for Sri Lanka </p><p>and Maldives: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Post is pleased to report the implementation of </p><p>the GLOBE program in Sri Lanka.  The Ministry of </p><p>Human Resource Development, Education and Culture </p><p>(MHREC) conducted the first three GLOBE teacher- </p><p>training programs in late 2002.  Econ Officer and </p><p>USAEP director attended the inaugural training </p><p>workshop and formally presented training kits to </p><p>attendees.  As of early January 2003, 42 secondary </p><p>school teachers have been trained in GLOBE </p><p>protocols and computer use.  In addition, GLOBE </p><p>clubs have been formed in about 30 schools.  The </p><p>GLOBE program is now being implemented in these </p><p>schools. </p><p> </p><p>3. Although Sri Lanka signed the GLOBE agreement in </p><p>December 1999 and 4 trainers attended an </p><p>international workshop, actual implementation of </p><p>the program was delayed for several years due to </p><p>government budgetary constraints.  In 2002, Post </p><p>provided a $20,000 (Rs 2.18 million) grant to the </p><p>Sri Lanka GLOBE program from funds available under </p><p>an earlier PL416(B) food aid grant.  MHREC is </p><p>utilizing these funds for conducting teacher- </p><p>training workshops.  In addition, a recent USAEP </p><p>grant enabled an officer in charge of the GLOBE </p><p>program at MHREC to attend this month\'s training </p><p>workshop in New Zealand.  Her attendance is </p><p>expected to give a further boost to the </p><p>implementation of the program in Sri Lanka.   Post </p><p>will continue to support GLOBE through USAEP </p><p>assistance and informal supervision and guidance. </p><p> </p><p>Maldives </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Government of Maldives notified Post in </p><p>2002 that it is ready to sign the GLOBE agreement. </p><p>Once the amended agreement, changing the US party </p><p>from NOAA to NASA, is approved, Post expects to </p><p>begin arrangements for a signing ceremony with the </p><p>Maldivian government. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
