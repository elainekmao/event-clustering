RANGOON 1292 </p><p>     B. 01 RANGOON 1819 </p><p>     C. 01 RANGOON 783 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Power is flowing nearly 24 hours a day in the </p><p>capital.  The government is making this happen through a </p><p>hodgepodge of policy proclamations, full dams at the </p><p>hydropower plants, and expensive, and potentially dangerous, </p><p>stopgap measures.  Because of increasing agitation over food </p><p>prices, the regime is trying to hold this Potemkin village </p><p>together until after the harvests in November.  However, as </p><p>we see no long-term solution on the drawing board, we expect </p><p>darkness to descend again by the end of the dry season.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Light at the End of the Tunnel? </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Denizens of Rangoon have been pleasantly surprised by </p><p>nearly 24 hour electricity in their homes since September 18 </p><p>or 19.  The government asserts that this will be the reality </p><p>from now on as additional natural gas is brought into the </p><p>city from the offshore Yadana field.  Also, the government </p><p>says, a turbine in a Rangoon-area power plant has been fixed </p><p>allowing for full capacity generation of power.  The </p><p>government mouthpiece newspaper New Light of Myanmar has been </p><p>filled with photos and stories of officials from the Ministry </p><p>of Electric Power visiting power plants, factories, and </p><p>government offices offering "guidance" on production and </p><p>conservation of electricity. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The government is, in fact, able to pipe some gas now </p><p>from Yadana to the capital.  However, there is less to their </p><p>claims than meets the eye.  This gas is coming over a </p><p>haphazard collection of poorly constructed pipelines of </p><p>varying diameters running from Kanbauk in Tanintharyi </p><p>Division up to Hpa\'an and then on to Rangoon.  A Ministry of </p><p>Energy official claims it is now piping 50 million cubic feet </p><p>a day (mcfd) through this pipeline network (although he </p><p>admitted that most of this was consumed by factories and </p><p>power plants along the way).  UNOCAL says that supplies now </p><p>are running about 40 mcfd, though how long the pipeline can </p><p>sustain the volume remains a question mark.  Because of its </p><p>poor quality, the existing Burmese pipeline system could </p><p>easily be disabled through corrosion, flooding along the </p><p>pipeline\'s path, or explosion. </p><p> </p><p>No Easy Way Out </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other than this shaky supply from Yadana, the </p><p>government is relying on four things to keep the lights </p><p>burning in Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>-- First, the government has ceased piping 8 mcfd of gas per </p><p>day from the onshore A\'Pyauk field, near Rangoon, to a power </p><p>plant near Thaton.  This supply has been redirected to power </p><p>plants in the Rangoon area. </p><p> </p><p>-- Second, the government is now firing up existing </p><p>hydropower plants whose dams are full following the heavy </p><p>monsoon season this year. </p><p> </p><p>-- Third, the government is pushing massive conservation </p><p>efforts, both in the ministries and at state-owned factories. </p><p> Ministry buildings, government schools, and hospitals are </p><p>kept dark except for emergencies.  A representative of a </p><p>foreign oil company told us that the government has ceased </p><p>sending gas to its fertilizer and methanol plants. </p><p> </p><p>-- Finally, the government is spending precious hard currency </p><p>to import high-speed diesel fuel (at around $40/barrel) to </p><p>run generators and dual-fuel turbines. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) These strategies may be effective in the short term, </p><p>but are not sustainable.  As reported in Refs B and C, the </p><p>A\'Pyauk gas field is nearly drained, producing at under 40 </p><p>mcfd and declining rapidly.  The other major onshore gas </p><p>field, in Nyaung Doun, is masking some of A\'Pyauk\'s decline </p><p>(producing between 25 and 45 mcfd depending on whom you ask), </p><p>but is being exploited too quickly.  This unwise strategy </p><p>shortens the fields economic life span and risks spoiling the </p><p>gas by sucking water into the reserve.  Based on our sources, </p><p>we think the A\'Pyauk field could run dry within a year.  The </p><p>Nyaung Doun field should hold out a few more years, but </p><p>unsound drilling practices could reduce yield and drive up </p><p>costs of production. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Hydropower is also only a temporary balm.  If </p><p>conditions are perfect, hydropower plants in operation can </p><p>generate 350-390 MW of power (Rangoon relies on hydropower </p><p>for 250 MW), but nearly 40 percent of this will be lost </p><p>during transmission.  However, some of these plants are in </p><p>dire need of refurbishment, and in any event, this peak </p><p>generating capacity is available only during the period of </p><p>least demand, during the post-monsoon "cool season" (October </p><p>to February).  The dams are usually quite low, and generation </p><p>capacity much reduced, during the "hot season" period of peak </p><p>demand (March to July).  The government claims that 2136.6 MW </p><p>of new hydropower will be available over the next five years </p><p>as new dams and plants are built.  However, only about 510 MW </p><p>of new generating capacity is predicted between now and the </p><p>end of 2003 -- and we are skeptical of this number. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Burmese government claims it is moving away from </p><p>fueling its power plants with imported oil as it is a very </p><p>expensive solution -- particularly as the cost of Malaysian </p><p>and Sumatran oil rises alongside Middle East oil.  Domestic </p><p>oil fields are producing about 6000 barrels a day, but the </p><p>production is not economical and provides only about 60 </p><p>percent of total domestic demand during normal times.  No new </p><p>oil production is forecasted, although the Chinese National </p><p>Petroleum Company has agreed to work with the Ministry of </p><p>Energy to try and pump out any remaining oil in the old Pyay </p><p>fields north of Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, radical conservation by government ministries </p><p>will have no real impact on the energy situation here.  More </p><p>alarming is if the government continues to keep hospitals and </p><p>schools in the dark.  Though keeping fertilizer and other </p><p>factories idled will have the largest impact on energy </p><p>conservation (we estimate that heavy industry here consumes </p><p>about 85 mcfd of gas) the impact on the economy, and in the </p><p>case of fertilizer plants food yields, will be devastating. </p><p> </p><p>Which Way Out? </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Unfortunately there are no quick, or cheap, solutions. </p><p> The most logical move would be for the Burmese to claim the </p><p>right it negotiated several years ago to 125 million cubic </p><p>feet a day of Yadana gas by approving the Total/UNOCAL plan </p><p>to build a 20-inch pipeline directly from the Yadana to </p><p>Rangoon.  This has been tabled since the end of 2000 due to </p><p>reluctance by Senior General Than Shwe to front the $750 </p><p>million (over 15 years) price tag.  A Ministry of Energy </p><p>official said, though, that there was no interest now in </p><p>continuing with this project.  Instead the focus would remain </p><p>on using the existing domestically constructed pipelines, </p><p>cooperating with neighboring countries on regional pipeline </p><p>projects, and on developing hydropower.  The latter two </p><p>priorities are long-term solutions. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) If, as we predict, Burma\'s dwindling onshore gas </p><p>reserves suddenly become unreliable, the only short-term </p><p>option for the Burmese government will be to try its luck </p><p>buying additional gas from the Yadana pipeline consortium, </p><p>expensive and unlikely if the Thais increase demand or if the </p><p>Burmese do not upgrade their pipeline network.  Another </p><p>option would be to negotiate with the Yetagun operators for a </p><p>share of its Thai-destined gas, though this too would be a </p><p>very expensive solution.  Failing this, the Burmese might </p><p>have to return to the most expensive option of all, shifting </p><p>their plants back onto imported oil, and increasing their </p><p>purchases from Malaysia. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) We cannot predict exactly when the lights will start </p><p>going out again, but we would be surprised if the government </p><p>could keep its expensive patchwork of stopgap measures in </p><p>place for long.  Because of growing unrest over mounting food </p><p>prices, see Ref A, the government is desperate to maintain </p><p>the illusion of government sacrifice and electricity upgrades </p><p>until after the rice harvest in October of November. </p><p>However, once the flush of monsoon-driven hydropower subsides </p><p>in January and February, the government will be stuck trying </p><p>to supply nearly all the country\'s energy needs with imported </p><p>oil and gas.  This is an impossible proposition for an </p><p>already foreign exchange-poor country.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
