WHEN THEY </p><p>REACHED THE PLATEAU IN FRONT OF LUKA THEY LAY THE </p><p>BODIES THERE.  GORAN THEN ORDERED ONE OF THE </p><p>PRISONERS TO BEND DOWN AND LICK THE BLOOD OFF OF ONE </p><p>OF THE CORPSES AND, AS THE PRISONER DID SO, GORAN </p><p>SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.  ANOTHER ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN </p><p>THEN GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND BEGGED GORAN NOT TO </p><p>KILL HIM BECAUSE HE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER.  GORAN </p><p>KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT.  THE WITNESS AND THE FOURTH </p><p>MAN THEN RETURNED TO THE WAREHOUSE TO THE SAME CORNER </p><p>FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CALLED.  SUDDENLY, GORAN </p><p>RUSHED IN, FORCED HIS PISTOL INTO THE FOURTH MAN\'S </p><p>MOUTH AND SHOT HIM.  THE WITNESS STOOD </p><p>THERE HELPLESSLY, WANTING ONLY TO HAVE THE NIGHTMARE </p><p>OVER.

GORAN JELISIC ORDERED HIM </p><p>INTO HIS OFFICE AND SCREAMED, "SIT DOWN|"  ADMIR </p><p>SARAJLIC WAS ALREADY THERE BEING INTERROGATED AND WAS </p><p>BEING BEATEN WITH STICKS AND HAMMERS.  AT THAT </p><p>MOMENT, THE PHONE RANG, AND AFTER A BRIEF </p><p>CONVERSATION, GORAN ASKED ADMIR HIS NAME.  ADMIR </p><p>REPLIED AND GORAN SAID, "YOU\'RE LUCKY.  YOU WERE </p><p>FOURTH ON THE LIST TO BE SHOT, AND THIS BLOODY MONKEY </p><p>WAS FIFTH, BUT YOU\'RE BOTH RELEASED."  THEY WERE </p><p>TAKEN BACK TO THE SAME WAREHOUSE AND, AT TWILIGHT, </p><p>WERE RELEASED ALONG WITH THE WITNESS\'S BROTHER.  THEY </p><p>WENT FIRST TO THEIR AUNT\'S APARTMENT, THEN TO </p><p>ANOTHER, AND FINALLY TO HIS OWN IN NOVO BRCKO. </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00919  04 OF 07  041726Z </p><p> </p><p>15.

WHEN </p><p>THE WITNESS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW HER WHEREABOUTS, </p><p>ZORAN BEAT THE WITNESS AND HIS BROTHER ON THE HEAD </p><p>AND IN THE KIDNEYS.

THESE INCLUDED A 14-YEAR-OLD </p><p>BOY WHO WAS ACCUSED OF CUTTING THE EYES OUT OF SERBS; </p><p>A TOOLMAKER ACCUSED OF MAKING KNIVES; AND A </p><p>BODYBUILDER WHO, APPARENTLY, WAS BEATEN JUST BECAUSE </p><p>HE WAS SO WELL BUILT.  DURING THIS TIME, ONE WOULD BE </p><p>BEATEN JUST FOR LIFTING ONE\'S HEAD.

THE </p><p>ICRC, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, DID NOT CHECK THE </p><p>LISTS REGULARLY DURING THEIR TWO VISITS PER MONTH. </p><p>IF THEY DID CHECK, THEY WERE TOLD THE MISSING WERE </p><p>AWAY ON LABOR DETAILS AND WOULD RETURN IN THE </p><p>EVENING.
