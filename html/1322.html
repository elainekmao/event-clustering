IRVING.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A MEETING OCTOBER 23, MDC MP FOR HARARE </p><p>CENTRAL MICHAEL AURET INFORMED POLOFF THAT THE MDC PLANS </p><p>TO GIVE NOTICE OCTOBER 24 IN PARLIAMENT THAT IT WILL </p><p>TABLE A MOTION FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  AURET CLAIMED THAT THE MDC HAS </p><p>COMPILED "OVERWHELMING" EVIDENCE THAT MUGABE DIRECTED </p><p>THE CAMPAIGN OF MASS TERROR AGAINST FARMERS, THEIR </p><p>WORKERS, AND OTHER OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN THE RUN-UP </p><p>TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE MDC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION WILL ATTEMPT TO GET THE MOTION </p><p>ON A SECRET BALLOT SO THAT MPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE </p><p>AISLE CAN VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE WITHOUT FEAR OF </p><p>RETRIBUTION.  THE SPEAKER AND DEPUTY SPEAKER WERE </p><p>ELECTED BY SECRET BALLOT, AURET SAID, AND HE HOPED THAT </p><p>THE SAME COULD BE DONE WITH THE IMPEACHMENT MEASURE.  IF </p><p>AT LEAST 50 MPS VOTE IN FAVOR, THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES </p><p>THAT A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE BE ESTABLISHED TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER THE GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT EXIST.  A </p><p>SEPARATE VOTE OF TWO-THIRDS OF PARLIAMENT (100 VOTES) </p><p>WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO IMPEACH MUGABE.  THERE ARE NOT </p><p>ENOUGH MPS WILLING TO CROSS THE AISLE TO IMPEACH MUGABE, </p><p>BUT IF EVEN A FEW ZANU-PF MPS VOTED WITH THE MDC ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, IT WOULD BE A MAJOR BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT, AURET </p><p>OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MDC MP TENDAI BITI TOLD USAIDOFFS THAT THE MDC </p><p>PLANS TO TABLE A SECOND MOTION THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE </p><p>STANDING RULES ON IMPEACHMENT PROCEDURE, WHICH IS NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05951  231447Z </p><p>SPELLED OUT IN DETAIL IN THE CONSTITUTION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>BITI, THE MDC IS SEEKING AN IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NUMBER OF SEATS IT HAS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND ONE THAT CAN HOLD HEARINGS OPEN TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC.  CURRENTLY, THE SPEAKER HAS THE POWER TO APPOINT </p><p>ALL THE SEATS ON THE COMMITTEE, AND HE COULD ALSO SHELVE </p><p>THE ISSUE WITHOUT DEBATE.  THE MDC DOES NOT EXPECT TO </p><p>ACTUALLY REMOVE MUGABE FROM OFFICE THIS WAY, BUT IT </p><p>HOPES TO MAKE THE PROCESS MORE DEMOCRATIC, SAYS BITI. </p><p>WELSHMAN NCUBE, THE MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD </p><p>USAIDOFFS THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE MUGABE WOULD DISSOLVE </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO HEAD OFF IMPEACHMENT.  SUCH A MOVE WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS TO BE HELD WITHIN 90 </p><p>DAYS, AND ZANU-PF IS MORE AFRAID OF AN ELECTION DEFEAT </p><p>NOW THAN IT WAS IN JUNE, ACCORDING TO NCUBE.  INSTEAD, </p><p>THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO WAS DUE TO HAVE MET THIS PAST </p><p>WEEKEND TO DEBATE THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY TO SHORT-CIRCUIT THE IMPEACHMENT EFFORT BEFORE </p><p>IT REACHES THE FLOOR OF PARLIAMENT NEXT WEEK, ACCORDING </p><p>TO NCUBE. (COMMENT: WE HAVE NOT HEARD WHETHER THIS </p><p>MEETING IN FACT TOOK PLACE. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: NCUBE\'S REMARKS MAKE SENSE TO A POINT: </p><p>MUGABE IS MORE LIKELY TO DECLARE MARTIAL LAW BEFORE HE </p><p>DISSOLVES PARLIAMENT TO STAVE OFF HIS IMPEACHMENT.  (A </p><p>STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD REQUIRE PARLIAMENT\'S APPROVAL, </p><p>WHEREAS MARTIAL LAW WOULD NOT.)  HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>DEBATABLE WHETHER MUGABE WOULD GO TO SUCH LENGTHS BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT ACTS ON A MEASURE THAT HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF </p><p>SUCCESS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A </p><p>SCENARIO IN WHICH A LARGE NUMBER OF ZANU-PF "YOUNG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05951  231447Z </p><p>TURKS" (SEE REFTEL) VOTE FOR THE IMPEACHMENT MEASURE </p><p>NEXT WEEK ON A SECRET BALLOT, AND THE MDC FOLLOWS </p><p>THROUGH ON ITS MASS ACTION PLANS AT THE SAME TIME. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE JUDGE THE PROBABLITY OF IT COMING OFF AS </p><p>LOW, THIS SITUATION COULD MAKE MUGABE FEEL THREATENED </p><p>ENOUGH TO IMPOSE MARTIAL LAW.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
