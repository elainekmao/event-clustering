<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 01014 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINT, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: HIZBALLAH ON THE MOVE </p><p> </p><p>1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  SOME WEEKS AGO, IN A MESSAGE ON </p><p>POTENTIAL NEW HIZBALLAH TACTICS IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>JENCO KIDNAPPING AND THE MURDER OF TWO FRENCH MILITARY </p><p>OBSERVERS, EMBASSY BEIRUT SPECULATED THAT HIZBALLAH IS </p><p>BEGINNING TO SHIFT TOWARD A MORE PUBLIC, VISIBLE STANCE, </p><p>PARTLY BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY FELT STRONG ENOUGH.  WE </p><p>NOW HAVE MORE EVIDENCE OF THIS.  FIRST, ON FEBRUARY 16 </p><p>HIZBALLAH ISSUED ITS FIRST PUBLIC PROGRAMMATIC MANIFESTO </p><p>(BEIRUT 1013), INTER ALIA, CALLING FOR THE DEPARTURE OF </p><p>THE US, FRANCE AND THEIR ALLIES FROM LEBANON AND THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC REGIME.  SECOND, ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 18, ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, VARIOUSLY </p><p>NUMBERED AT 1500-12,000, WERE BUSSED TO SIDON FROM BEIRUT </p><p>AND CONTROLLED THE CITY\'S STREETS FOR A DAY AS ARMY </p><p>STOOD BY.  THIS WAS AN OMINOUS DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH </p><p>AND WILL AND ABILITY TO ACT THAT WILL SHARPEN EXISTING </p><p>BATTLE LINES AND TENSIONS IN LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BUSLOADS OF HEAVILY ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, </p><p>BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND ESTIMATED BY WESTERN NEWS AGENCIES </p><p>TO NUMBER 1500-12,000, DROVE FROM BEIRUT TO SIDON ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 18 TO MARCH THROUGH CITY STREETS, BURNING THE </p><p>LEBANESE FLAG AND SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST PRESIDENT </p><p>GEMAYEL.  SOME 20 SHOPS SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES </p><p>WERE SACKED.  AS SIDON RESIDENTS AND LAF TROOPS LOOKED </p><p>ON WITHOUT INTERVENING, DEMONSTRATORS ARMED WITH AK-47S </p><p>AND ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES RALLIED IN CITY SQUARES, </p><p>SHOUTING SLOGANS SUCH AS "DEATH TO GEMAYEL," "SIDON IS </p><p>MUSLIM AND CANNOT BE RULED BY A MARONITE," AND "GEMAYEL </p><p>IS AN AGENT."  DEMONSTRATORS WAVED IRANIAN AND HIZBALLAH </p><p>FLAGS AND CARRIED PICTURES OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI.  A </p><p>SMALLER GROUP OF AMAL MEMBERS CONDUCTED THEIR OWN </p><p>DEMONSTRATION SEPARATE FROM THAT OF HIZBALLAH.  (AMAL </p><p>LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT DENOUNCING THE HIZBALLAH RALLIES </p><p>AND CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AT THE ARMY CHECKPOINT AT </p><p>KHALDE, LAF TROOPS CHEERED AND WAVED THE BUS CONVOY </p><p>THROUGH, WHILE PSP MILITIAMEN FURTHER SOUTH ALSO </p><p>WELCOMED IT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY STAR, SIDON DEPUTY </p><p>NAZIH BIZRI, A SUNNI, EXPRESSED DISMAY THAT THE </p><p>MILITIAMEN IGNORED THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY SIDON\'S </p><p>LEADERS NOT TO ALLOW THE BEARING OF ARMS IN THE CITY.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE PEOPLE OF SIDON WERE CROSS AND ANGRY, BUT </p><p>THAT THE INCIDENT WILL NOT SPOIL THE UNITY OF THE CITY. </p><p>HE SAID THAT THE ARMY DID NOT INTERVENE IN ORDER NOT TO </p><p>PROVOKE A CLASH.  ON MONDAY, A GROUP OF SIDON SUNNI </p><p>NOTABLES ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE CONDEMNING MONDAY\'S "ARMED </p><p>AND MASSIVE" DEMONSTRATION.  "WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF FACTION, TO VIOLATE THE DECISION TO BAN </p><p>ARMS FROM THE LIBERATED CITY, OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE </p><p>ARMY AND THE ISF." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: THE FEBRUARY 16 MANIFESTO AND MONDAY\'S </p><p>DEMONSTRATION MARK A NEW STEP BY HIZBALLAH TOWARDS BE- </p><p>COMING AN ACTIVE POLITICAL MOVEMENT OVERTLY DECLARING </p><p>AND PURSUING ITS GOAL OF THE ISLAMICIZATION OF LEBANON. </p><p>AT A MINIMUM, THIS MEANS THAT THE TENSIONS AND BATTLE </p><p>LINES AMONG COMPETING FORCES IN LEBANON WILL BE MUCH </p><p>MORE SHARPLY DRAWN: </p><p> </p><p>A.  WITHIN THE SHIA COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>PROVIDED GRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF AMAL-HIZBALLAH RIVALRY. </p><p>PRESS REPORTS SPOKE OF EVIDENT DISPLEASURE ON THE PART </p><p>OF AMAL DEMONSTRATORS, WHILE AMAL\'S LATER DENUNCIATION </p><p>OF THE DEMONSTRATION IS THE FIRST EXPLICIT DISAPPROVAL OF </p><p>THIS TYPE THAT WE CAN RECALL.  MOREOVER, HIZBALLAH HAS </p><p>CLEARLY MARKED OUT ITS FUTURE POLITICAL IDENTITY IN </p><p>LEBANON--IN THE SIDON RALLIES, ITS SLOGANS SUPPORTING </p><p>AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC TOOK PRIDE OF PLACE OVER AMAL\'S </p><p>CALLS FOR THROWING THE ISRAELIS OUT OF THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>B.  SUNNI-SHIA.  HIZBALLAH\'S RALLY IN THE VERY HEART </p><p>OF THE SUNNI CAPITAL OF THE SOUTH RECALLS THE WORST FEARS </p><p>OF THE SUNNIS, AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR COMMUNIQUE.  IN </p><p>FURTHER SUNNI REACTION, A DELEGATION FROM THE SUNNI </p><p>CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION MAQASSAD (WHICH IS HEADED BY </p><p>SAIB SALAM\'S SON TAMAM) IS TRAVELLING TO SIDON ON </p><p>TUESDAY IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS THAT A PTT EMPLOYEE HAS </p><p>BEEN KILLED BY ARMED MEN NEWLY APPEARING ON CITY STREETS. </p><p> </p><p>C.  THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>WILL ALSO EVOKE THE WORST FEARS OF THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY, FURTHER PROVOKING A DEFENSIVE, SEIGE </p><p>MENTALITY AND PUTTING MORE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS.  WE ARE STRUCK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S SINGLING OUT THE PHALANGE IN ITS WEEKEND </p><p>COMMUNIQUE AND BY ITS ATTACKS ON GEMAYEL.  THIS, </p><p>TOGETHER WITH JUMBLATT\'S HEATED RHETORIC AGAINST THE </p><p>REGIME AND MIMICKING OF THE ISLAMIC CAUSE OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND (BEIRUT 0993),WILL HARDLY ENCOURAGE ANY </p><p>CHRISTIAN TENDENCIES TOWARD FLEXIBILITY. </p><p>D.  SECURITY AND THE ROLE OF THE ARMY.  THE LIMP </p><p>AND EVEN HARMFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE ARMY ON MONDAY HAS </p><p>ABRUPTLY NULLIFIED THE EUPHORIA OF THE SIDON CITIZENRY </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE LAF\'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO THE CITY </p><p>ON SATURDAY.  PRECISELY WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ORDER AND TO SUPPORT SIDON NOTABLES\' CALLS FOR </p><p>"DISARMAMENT," THE LAF FAILED ITS FIRST, AND PERHAPS </p><p>MOST CRUCIAL, TEST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN ONE SENSE, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE MORE </p><p>HIZBALLAH COMES OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND BATTLE LINES </p><p>ARE DRAWN, THE BETTER THE SITUATION IS IN TERMS OF </p><p>GALVANIZING BARRI (WHOM WE HAVE BEEN WARNING ON THIS </p><p>VERY TOPIC FOR SOME TIME) AND THE SUNNIS, AT LEAST </p><p>IN SIDON.  ONE THING IS CLEAR: FEW LEBANESE OF ANY </p><p>COMMUNITY OR PERSUASION WANT TO LIVE IN AN ISLAMIC </p><p>REPUBLIC.  (THE BULK OF THE SHIA DO NOT FOLLOW THIS LINE </p><p>YET, ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLE LATENT STRENGTH.) </p><p>IN ANY EVENT, ON THIS POINT, THERE IS A TIE THAT BINDS </p><p>THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS TO THE GREAT MAJORITY </p><p>OF CHRISTIANS.  ACCORDINGLY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>FIND A BASIS FOR CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM COOPERATION IN MEETING </p><p>A THREAT TO ALL OF THEM WHICH IS GREATER THAN ANY </p><p>DIFFERENCES THAT MAY SEPARATE THEM.  THEN AGAIN, THIS </p><p>IS LEBANON.  IN ANY CASE, WE WILL BE CLOSELY TRACKING </p><p>THE REACTION TO THE SIDON DEMONSTRATIONS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>ON THE PART OF THE MODERATE SHIAS. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
