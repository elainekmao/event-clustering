<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND PRM </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, BG, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: UNHCR TO CLOSE IN BANGLADESH </p><p> </p><p>REF: DHAKA 190 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez, Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: UNHCR tells us it plans to close down its </p><p>refugee operations in Bangladesh at the end of 2003.  In </p><p>2004, it will look at the possibility of closing its </p><p>operations in Burma\'s northern Rakhine State.  Whatever the </p><p>merits of the decision in Bangladesh, in Burma, premature </p><p>closure of UNHCR\'s operations will raise the risks of a new </p><p>refugee crisis.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Hitoshi Mise, the Deputy Director for UNHCR\'s Asia </p><p>Division told diplomats on February 4 that UNHCR would end </p><p>support for refugee repatriation from Bangladesh on June 30, </p><p>2003 and close down UNHCR\'s operations in Bangladesh entirely </p><p>at the end of 2003.  It would review UNHCR\'s operations in </p><p>Burma in 2004 and make a decision then whether to close there </p><p>as well, probably at the end of 2004. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mise said that this decision had been coming for some </p><p>time.  UNHCR\'s operations in Bangladesh and Burma were among </p><p>the most UNHCR\'s protracted.  Moreover, most refugees have </p><p>already been repatriated.  Of the 250,000 refugees that left </p><p>Burma for Bangladesh in the early 1990s, 230,000 have already </p><p>returned.  Only 22,000 remain in Bangladesh and while </p><p>approximately 1,000 were still returning each year, that was </p><p>less than annual camp births and not enough to reduce the </p><p>refugee population.  Of the remaining refugees, only about </p><p>7,000 had been cleared by Burma for repatriation, but, even </p><p>among those, not all were ready to return.  Some had </p><p>protection problems; others had a variety of family or </p><p>economic reasons for refusing repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In any case, UNHCR had tried to work out arrangements </p><p>to allow the remaining refugees to establish a new </p><p>"self-sustaining capacity" in Bangladesh, pending </p><p>repatriation to Burma.  They had presented this plan to </p><p>Bangladesh\'s Foreign Secretary in January, but, since the </p><p>plan involved refugees working within the local economy, the </p><p>Foreign Secretary rejected the program as a cover for local </p><p>resettlement of the refugees.  This left UNHCR with few </p><p>options, according to Mise.  Hence the decision to close the </p><p>camps. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mise emphasized that at least the June 30 deadline was </p><p>not hard and fast.  If refugees wanted to return to Burma </p><p>after that date, UNHCR would most likely provide some </p><p>assistance.  It had also opened a dialogue with other UN </p><p>agencies to ensure there was support for the refugees who </p><p>remained behind in Bangladesh after December 31, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mise also said that he believed that the Government of </p><p>Bangladesh was looking for a way to put the refugee problem </p><p>behind them.  Burmese contacts had told him that the </p><p>Bangladeshis had scarcely raised the refugee issue during </p><p>Than Shwe\'s December visit.  Bangladesh\'s State Minister for </p><p>Foreign Affairs had also told him unofficially that </p><p>Bangladesh could not grant the remaining refugees asylum, for </p><p>fear of becoming a target country for other refugees, but was </p><p>looking for another way out -- "a discreet solution to the </p><p>problem."   In that context, UNHCR\'s approach, by taking the </p><p>burden of decision off the Bangladeshis, could work. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) UNHCR may be right in this case.  We have heard the </p><p>same comments from Burmese sources about fading Bangladesh </p><p>government interest in the refugee question.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the BDG does need a way out and UNHCR, by acting </p><p>unilaterally, may allow the BDG to avoid responsibility for </p><p>the decision while still accepting the fait accompli. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) That said, there may be problems.  According to </p><p>UNHCR\'s Resident Representative in Rangoon, there are </p><p>probably 3,000 to 5,000 refugees still in camps in Bangladesh </p><p>that have legitimate protection problems and a legitimate </p><p>fear of political persecution, should they return to Burma. </p><p>What happens to those individuals if they find themselves </p><p>unable to support themselves in Bangladesh?  Secondly, the </p><p>entire Rohingya Muslim community in Northern Rakhine State </p><p>remains under intense military, political, and social </p><p>pressure.  UNHCR, through its protection services, has been </p><p>able to deflect some of these pressures.  However, there is </p><p>really no one to replace UNHCR, if it pulls out.  Efforts to </p><p>establish development programs in northern Rakhine State </p><p>under the auspices of other UN agencies (e.g., through the </p><p>Basic Needs Assessment Program in 2000 and 2001) have made </p><p>little progress.  More importantly, however, UNHCR is the </p><p>only UN agency that has maintained a consistent focus on </p><p>human rights in its operations.  All others have shied from </p><p>the issue.  Its exit, consequently, may leave the Rohingya </p><p>Muslim population unprotected and raise the risks of a new </p><p>exodus.  That does not necessarily have to be the result, but </p><p>Post strongly suggests the USG discuss with the United </p><p>Nations and other interested parties alternate protection </p><p>arrangements that could substitute for UNHCR\'s operations in </p><p>northern Rakhine State.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Dhaka. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
