Editorials in Zimbabwe\'s newspapers continue to </p><p>      focus on the ongoing World Summit on Sustainable </p><p>      Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Earth summit hopes of ending </p><p>      African poverty" the independent daily "The Daily News) </p><p>      (09/02/02) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "By the time the WSSD ends in Johannesburg later </p><p>      this week, nearly 100 world leaders, including </p><p>      President Mugabe, will have presented their </p><p>      theories on how to end world poverty.  Africa, </p><p>      as the poorest continent, has been at the center </p><p>      of the discussion preceding the arrival of the </p><p>      world leaders.  If the summit\'s proposals to end </p><p>      poverty are implemented with more honesty and </p><p>      dedication than the resolutions of the summit in </p><p>      Rio de Janeiro in 1992, then there is a chance </p><p>      the world could strike a decisive blow against </p><p>      poverty. . .  The struggle against poverty is </p><p>      essentially a demand by the poor for the </p><p>      developed world to loosen its purse strings when </p><p>      dealing with the developing world, whether it is </p><p>      in bilateral trade or straightforward aid. . . </p><p>      In view of the failure of the rich nations to </p><p>      live up to their promises at the Rio summit, who </p><p>      can blame the angry demonstrators (against the </p><p>      summit in Johannesburg)?  At the same time, </p><p>      there ought to (be simultaneous) demonstrations </p><p>      against corruption in Africa." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Region reflects on land" the </p><p>      weekly ZANU PF organ "The People\'s Voice" (09/01/02) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The issue of land was first brought onto the </p><p>      agenda of the international community by the </p><p>      conference of representatives of peasants and </p><p>      peasant communities a few years ago.  But, now </p><p>      it has been inscribed in bold letters at the </p><p>      WSSD in Johannesburg.  All developing countries </p><p>      should address the issue of land ownership, and </p><p>      land utilization, and find viable solutions.  In </p><p>      southern Africa, Zimbabwe has led the way by </p><p>      asserting the rights of the indigenous people </p><p>      over their own natural resources.  That </p><p>      assertion is now being supported by the friendly </p><p>      governments of Namibia and South Africa, who are </p><p>      suggesting a regional approach to the land </p><p>      question.  That would be an important step </p><p>      forward for the peasant farmers in the fourteen </p><p>      nations of the SADC. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
