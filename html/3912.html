<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005826 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MFA PROPOSING NEW, MORE LIBERAL LAW </p><p>GOVERNING ITS FOREIGN SERVICE </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4864 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor Douglas A. Silliman for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  MFA Legal Advisor Samer Naber told PolCouns recently </p><p>that one of Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher\'s current highest </p><p>administrative priorities is to pass through the cabinet a </p><p>new law governing the Jordanian Foreign Service.  Naber said </p><p>the law, which he is writing, will incorporate at Muasher\'s </p><p>request strict gender equality in hiring, compensation, </p><p>benefits, and assignments.  Jordan\'s tradition , Naber said, </p><p>had been to hire unmarried women for its diplomatic service, </p><p>but require that they resign or agree to very restricted </p><p>careers if/when they married.  He claimed that this new law, </p><p>if passed by the cabinet and signed by the King, will be the </p><p>most liberal law governing public sector employment in </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In addition to gender equality, Naber said that </p><p>Muasher wanted to enshrine in law a requirement for strong </p><p>English language ability to apply for the Jordanian Foreign </p><p>Service.  Muasher believes that Jordanian diplomats must have </p><p>sophisticated English to carry out both policy and </p><p>increasingly important trade and investment promotion </p><p>responsibilities abroad.  Muasher had proposed to the cabinet </p><p>that all/all applicants show proof of a TOEFL (Test of </p><p>English as a Foreign Language) score of 600.  However, Naber </p><p>recounted, Muasher had run into opposition on this point from </p><p>other ministries, especially the (generally non-English </p><p>speaking) Interior Ministry.  Eventually, Muasher convinced </p><p>the cabinet to require s TOEFL score of 550 for all Foreign </p><p>Service aspirants. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The head of Jordan\'s Diplomatic Institute recently </p><p>told visiting FSI Dean Kathy Peterson that Muasher also wants </p><p>to create an examination process for both entry into and </p><p>promotion within the Foreign Service, and that Muasher is </p><p>stressing the need for leadership/management training for </p><p>diplomats who have traditionally focused on "diplomacy."  In </p><p>addition, he said Muasher wants to increase the quality and </p><p>frequency of economic training, as shown by the GOJ\'s efforts </p><p>to bring all Jordanian Ambassador\'s back to Amman for a </p><p>conference on economics and trade promotion (ref). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The draft Foreign Service law and Muasher\'s emphasis </p><p>on training reflect the forward-looking personal philosophy </p><p>of the Foreign Minister, both in terms of gender equality and </p><p>in preparing the Jordanian Foreign Service to integrate </p><p>Jordan into the world economy.  It is also instructive that </p><p>something as innocuous as an English language requirement </p><p>created a controversy that had to be solved at the cabinet </p><p>level. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
