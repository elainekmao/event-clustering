<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: SUPREME COURT JUSTICE COMMENTS ON REFORM </p><p>PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4834 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4862 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 4856 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Hasim Kilic, a senior Justice of the Turkish </p><p>Constitutional Court and a leading proponent of comprehensive </p><p>reform in Turkey, offered to A/Polcouns on Aug. 1 his views </p><p>on the AK Government legislative program and the prospects </p><p>for further democratization.  According to Kilic, AK\'s </p><p>legislative reforms concerning the powerful National Security </p><p>Council (NSC), which passed parliamentary muster July 30, </p><p>constitute an important step in redressing civilian-military </p><p>imbalance, particularly in that they make possible the </p><p>assignment of a civilian to fill the post of NSC SecGen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- President Sezer, Kilic said, is unlikely to veto the </p><p>package despite the express reservations of military </p><p>hard-liners to the changes (ref A and previous).  Kilic </p><p>expressed hope that the AK Government would eventually return </p><p>to the issue of bringing military budgeting under the control </p><p>of elected civilians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Kilic asserted that the most important change the AK </p><p>Government could make would be to transform the Turkish State </p><p>system by increasing the powers of the president and </p><p>subjecting the office to popular elections -- a move that the </p><p>"Deep State" (military/bureaucratic Establishment) would find </p><p>objectionable as long as AK was in power, he noted.  In </p><p>theory, these measures would serve to: 1) streamline the </p><p>system; and 2) allow an elected leader to cut through the </p><p>opposition of the entrenched, Establishment interests who </p><p>oversee the function of government and implementation of </p><p>policy, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Above all, Kilic asserted, implementation of reforms </p><p>is the key to Turkey\'s future success on the political front. </p><p> "Let me be frank," he said.  The High Court and other </p><p>elements of the judiciary are still subject to "telephone </p><p>calls from senior military officers telling judges how to </p><p>rule" on particular matters.  This, Kilic believed, would </p><p>take time to change.  It will also require "courage" and </p><p>independent-mindedness on the part of judicial officials, </p><p>"who over the past 80 years" (i.e., since the inception of </p><p>the Kemalist Republic) have been habituated to timidity, he </p><p>asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- One way to improve the judiciary would be to give </p><p>Parliament a say over who sits on the senior bench, Kilic </p><p>added.  He noted that currently, the legislature "has no </p><p>authority whatsoever" over an appointment process formally </p><p>dominated by the presidency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Kilic also observed that the current session of the </p><p>Supreme Military Council (YAS) is crucial.  It provides TGS </p><p>Chief Ozkok a chance to push out hard-line senior commanders </p><p>who oppose reform, he said.  Kilic expressed optimism that </p><p>Ozkok would prevail, given that the hard-liners really could </p><p>offer no alternative vision for Turkey. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
