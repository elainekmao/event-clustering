(U) This is an action cable.  See para 12 for action </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) MFA advised DCM that the GOT would like to hold </p><p>further talks on humanitarian assistance at a senior level, </p><p>and that a Memorandum of Understanding on this issue might be </p><p>necessary.  MFA wants to hold these coordinating discussions </p><p>at an "Ambassadorial" level with Ambassador Daryal Batibay, </p><p>MFA Director General for Multilateral Political Affairs </p><p>representing Turkey.  It offered to host bilateral </p><p>discussions on this during the last half of the week of March </p><p>3.  DCM told MFA that he would convey this request to </p><p>Washington.  This request followed a February 26 meeting at </p><p>MFA on structures for coordinating humanitarian assistance </p><p>with military needs, NGO access and other issues.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Humanitarian Aid Coordination: </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Mission Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO), accompanied </p><p>by Polmiloff, USAID,s Disaster Assistance Response Team </p><p>(DART), and representatives of the Military Coordination and </p><p>Liaison Command (MCLC), and EUCOM Forward, met with Feza </p><p>Ozturk, MFA Head of Department, International Political </p><p>Organizations, to discuss humanitarian assistance issues on </p><p>February 26. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MDRO told Ozturk that the USG is eager to establish a </p><p>mechanism that would bring together Turkish and American </p><p>civilian and military authorities, UN agencies and other </p><p>organizations, to reconcile delivery of humanitarian supplies </p><p>to Iraq with military needs.  Although the U.S. side is still </p><p>considering the most appropriate way to structure this </p><p>coordinating body, MDRO said that Diyarbakir would appear to </p><p>be the best location, based on GOT and UN plans to have a </p><p>presence there.  Pending establishment of this body, MDRO </p><p>suggested that U.S. and Turkish civilian and military </p><p>authorities begin meeting regularly on these issues in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk agreed that there is a need to coordinate </p><p>closely, but maintained the need for definite &guidelines8 </p><p>on the scope of our cooperation and the structure of a </p><p>coordinating entity, particularly with regard to its </p><p>relationship with any Turkish activities in northern Iraq. </p><p>He proposed a follow-up meeting on this issue on or about </p><p>March 7, and that he would include the Turkish General Staff </p><p>in this meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) In a telephone conversation with the DCM on February </p><p>27, Tunc Ugdul, MFA Deputy Director for International </p><p>Political Organizations, referred to the previous day,s </p><p>meeting and said that the GOT would like to hold further </p><p>talks on humanitarian assistance at a senior level, and that </p><p>a Memorandum of Understanding on this issue might be </p><p>necessary.  He said that Ambassador Daryal Batibay, MFA </p><p>Director General for Multilateral Political Affairs, or </p><p>another official of similar rank, could host bilateral </p><p>discussions on this during the last half of the week of March </p><p>3.  DCM told Ugdul that he would convey MFA,s request to </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NGO Access and Other Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) NGO Access:  At the February 26 meeting, Ozturk </p><p>reiterated that the GOT plans to allow NGOs with genuine </p><p>humanitarian aims to transit the border if there is a need </p><p>for their assistance in the area beyond Turkey,s border zone </p><p>in Iraq.  The GOT does not plan to levy customs or other </p><p>duties on humanitarian goods transiting Turkey destined for </p><p>Iraq.  He said NGOs were welcome to apply to MFA for permits, </p><p>but cautioned that the first application could take several </p><p>weeks to be approved.  Ozturk contrasted this arrangement </p><p>with more restrictive rules for NGOs intending to provide </p><p>assistance within Turkey or the immediate border area in Iraq </p><p>(see reftel and septel).  We responded that the USG, here and </p><p>in Washington, was working to inform NGOs of Turkish </p><p>procedures and that we expected the International Rescue </p><p>Committee and possibly other NGOs to apply to MFA soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Use of Iskenderun Port by UN Agencies:  We raised the </p><p>issue of World Food Program (WFP) access to the port of </p><p>Iskenderun.  WFP told us that it had been directed by MFA </p><p>several months ago to plan on using Iskenderun for import of </p><p>relief supplies, because the port of Mersin was reserved for </p><p>military use.  It emerged last week that U.S. military and </p><p>private use of Iskenderun could preclude WFP use of the port. </p><p> It also appears that Mersin will not be fully utilized by </p><p>the military.  Ozturk told us he was aware of the issue and </p><p>was working with WFP on alternatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Humanitarian Daily Rations (HDRs):  MDRO asked MFA </p><p>whether the GOT needed any further information to approve our </p><p>request to site HDRs in Turkey.  Ozturk responded that the </p><p>only outstanding issue was the actual warehouse location for </p><p>the HDRs, and that he would get back to us on this in the </p><p>near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) Role in Northern Iraq: </p><p>MDRO pointed out that the International Committee of the Red </p><p>Cross would have the mandate for coordinating aid in zones of </p><p>conflict, and asked how Ozturk whether the TRC would obtain </p><p>an ICRC mandate to operate in northern Iraq, as contemplated </p><p>in GOT plans.  Ozturk responded that TRC and the GOT would </p><p>work with ICRC on this issue.  He also contended that the </p><p>Turkish military would not manage Turkish camps in northern </p><p>Iraq, but merely provide external security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Request: </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Despite its professed openness to NGOs providing </p><p>assistance to Iraq, the GOT remains wary of them and would </p><p>instinctively prefer to define relationships with them in </p><p>advance, but a restrictive MOU on humanitarian assistance </p><p>could deter NGOs from even considering delivery of aid </p><p>through Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Embassy requests Washington guidance ASAP on </p><p>Turkey,s proposal to host further coordination talks on the </p><p>framework for humanitarian assistance next week, specifically </p><p>as to whether the U.S. is willing to have a senior-level team </p><p>address these issues, with a possible MOU negotiation on the </p><p>horizon. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
