<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LONDON 012113 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, UK </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT - UK </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 202128 </p><p> </p><p>1. THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' CLOSEST </p><p>ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  IT ROUTINELY TAKES A ROBUST STANCE AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, AND CONTRIBUTES ACTIVELY TO THE WORK OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BODIES -- PARTICULARLY THE UNITED NATIONS, THE </p><p>GROUP OF EIGHT (G8) AND THE EUROPEAN UNION -- IN PROMOTING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE CEASE- </p><p>FIRES IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE LESSENED THE INCIDENTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM, ALTHOUGH THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE FROM DISSIDENT </p><p>REPUBLICAN AND LOYALIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY AUTHORITIES.  RESPONSES BELOW ARE </p><p>KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPHS. </p><p> </p><p>A) DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>   --------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. RESPONDING TO THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AS </p><p>WELL AS TO TERRORISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUBLES IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND, UK COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY HAS DEVELOPED A </p><p>FOCUS ON MEASURES WHICH PROMOTE PRACTICAL TOOLS TO TARGET </p><p>TERRORISM WHEREVER IT ORIGINATES.  THE UK SEEKS TO ENSURE </p><p>CRIMINALS CANNOT EXPLOIT JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES TO ESCAPE </p><p>PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. TWO PIECES OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION HAVE PROVIDED THE </p><p>STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE UK\'S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS. THE </p><p>"PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT 1989" IS </p><p>APPLICABLE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IS DIRECTED </p><p>AGAINST BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND TERRORISM CONNECTED WITH </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND.  IT IS SUBJECT TO REGULAR REVIEW BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WHICH MUST RENEW ITS PROVISION ANNUALLY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, "THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT" </p><p>GIVES THE GOVERNMENT BROAD ANTI-TERRORISM POWERS IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM LEGISLATION IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBING ATROCITY </p><p>PERPETRATED BY THE "REAL IRA" IN AUGUST 1998 IN OMAGH, </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND.  A SPECIAL SESSION OF PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1998 PASSED "THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE (TERRORISM AND </p><p>CONSPIRACY) ACT 1998."  UNDER THIS LAW, IT IS NOW AN OFFENSE </p><p>TO CONSPIRE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO COMMIT ANY OFFENSE </p><p>(INCLUDING TERRORIST OFFENSES) ABROAD, PROVIDED THE ACTION </p><p>WOULD BE AN OFFENSE BOTH IN BRITAIN AND IN THE COUNTRY IN </p><p>WHICH IT WAS INTENDED TO OCCUR.  THE ACT ALSO ALLOWS A </p><p>STATEMENT BY A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER TO BE ADMISSIBLE AS </p><p>EVIDENCE OF ALLEGED MEMBERSHIP IN AN ILLEGAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION, ALTHOUGH FURTHER CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED FOR </p><p>A CONVICTION.  THE ACT ALLOWS THE INFERENCE OF GUILT TO BE </p><p>DRAWN FROM A REFUSAL TO ANSWER A RELEVANT QUESTION DURING </p><p>POLICE INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH ANY </p><p>RELEVANT INQUIRY PROVIDED THAT THE SUSPECT HAD AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT A ATTORNEY.  THE LAW ALSO PERMITS THE </p><p>COURT TO CONFISCATE ASSETS AND PROPERTY OF CONVICTED MEMBERS </p><p>OF PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATIONS WHERE IT DETERMINES THESE ASSETS </p><p>HAVE BEEN, OR MIGHT BE, USED IN FURTHERANCE OF TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN OCTOBER 1997, HOME SECRETARY JACK STRAW ANNOUNCED HIS </p><p>INTENTION TO PUBLISH A CONSULTATION PAPER ON NEW PERMANENT </p><p>UK-WIDE COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION TO REPLACE THE CURRENT </p><p>TEMPORARY PIECEMEAL PROVISIONS.  STRAW RECOGNIZED THAT "THE </p><p>CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN IRELAND ... DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE NO </p><p>LONGER NEED SPECIAL LEGISLATION TO INVESTIGATE, TO DISRUPT </p><p>AND TO COUNTER TERRORISM.  ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT THERE </p><p>IS AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF TERRORISTS.... SOME </p><p>MAY COMMIT ACTS OF TERRORISM WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, OR </p><p>RAISE FUNDS HERE, OR OTHERWISE USE THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A </p><p>BASE FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH ATTACKS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>6. UNDER THE LEAD OF THE HOME OFFICE, FURTHER </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION AS </p><p>PARLIAMENT AWAITS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PROMISED </p><p>CONSULTATIVE PAPER "HOPED" TO BE PUBLISHED IN EARLY 1999. </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL CONSIDER THE WIDER ASPECTS OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR </p><p>STRONGER POWERS TO CURB FUNDRAISING BY TERRORIST GROUPS AND </p><p>TO HINDER DOMESTIC ENCOURAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>B) EXTRADITION </p><p>   ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. A U.S. REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF KHALID AL-FAWWAZ IS </p><p>PENDING IN THE BRITISH COURTS.  AL-FAWWAZ, A SAUDI NATIONAL </p><p>ALLEGED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE USAMAH BIN LADEN ORGANIZATION, </p><p>HAS BEEN IN DETENTION SINCE HIS ARREST BY THE LONDON </p><p>METROPOLITAN POLICE IN OCTOBER 1998.  HE IS WANTED BY U.S. </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO FACE CHARGES FOR CONSPIRING TO MURDER </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS BETWEEN JANUARY 1993 AND SEPTEMBER 1998. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN MARCH 1998, THE HOME SECRETARY, CITING MEDICAL </p><p>GROUNDS, DECLINED TO EXTRADITE ROISIN MCALISKEY TO GERMANY </p><p>TO STAND TRIAL FOR OFFENSES RELATED TO A 1996 IRA ATTACK ON </p><p>A BRITISH MILITARY FACILITY IN GERMANY. </p><p> </p><p>C) IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION </p><p>   ----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS </p><p>TO UK PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>D) RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION </p><p>   -------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1998 BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY </p><p>BLAIR REITERATED BRITAIN\'S COMMITMENT TO COMBATING GLOBAL </p><p>TERRORISM IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SAYING </p><p>"[E]ACH [TERRORIST ATROCITY] IS A REMINDER THAT TERRORISM IS </p><p>A UNIQUELY BARBARIC AND COWARDLY CRIME.  EACH ONE IS A </p><p>REMINDER THAT TERRORISTS ARE NO RESPECTERS OF BORDERS.  EACH </p><p>ONE IS A REMINDER THAT TERRORISM SHOULD HAVE NO HIDING PLACE, </p><p>NO OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDS, NO LET-UP IN OUR DETERMINATION </p><p>TO BRING ITS PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE." </p><p> </p><p>E) MAJOR INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>   -------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. THE UK HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE ELEVEN UN CONVENTIONS </p><p>RELATING TO TERRORISM.  IN JANUARY 1998, IT SIGNED THE </p><p>ELEVENTH, THE UN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST </p><p>BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>12. IN 1998, BRITAIN USED ITS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE G8 AND </p><p>PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HIGHLIGHT TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUES. FOLLOWING THE MAY BIRMINGHAM SUMMIT, G8 FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS REAFFIRMED THEIR COLLECTIVE DETERMINATION "TO </p><p>COMBAT TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS, TO OPPOSE ANY CONCESSION </p><p>TO TERRORIST DEMANDS AND TO PROMOTE COORDINATED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORIST ACTION."  THEY IDENTIFIED </p><p>FOUR PRIORITY AREAS FOR FURTHER ACTION: PREVENTING </p><p>TERRORISTS FROM FUNDRAISING IN G8 STATES; UNITING AGAINST </p><p>RANSOM PAYMENTS UNDER A PRINCIPLE OF "NO CONCESSIONS;" </p><p>DENYING TERRORISTS ACCESS TO ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES; AND </p><p>STRENGTHENING AVIATION SECURITY. THE G8 FOREIGN MINISTERS, </p><p>LED BY THE UK, ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES </p><p>AGREED UNDER THE 1944 CHICAGO CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CIVIL AVIATION, AND STRONGLY URGED ALL STATES TO COMPLY. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY OF THE EU SOUGHT TO REFOCUS EU </p><p>EFFORTS ON COUNTERTERRORISM.  MEASURES IT PROPOSED INCLUDE: </p><p>COMBATING TERRORIST FUNDRAISING IN EU STATES; STRENGTHENING </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH </p><p>THE EU APPLICANT STATES OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND CYPRUS; </p><p>DEVELOPING EU POLICY GUIDANCE AGAINST EXTORTION OR RANSOM </p><p>DEMANDS; AND IMPROVED COORDINATION OF EU NATIONAL CRISIS </p><p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE UK HOSTED A US-EU SUMMIT IN LONDON IN MAY 1998 </p><p>WHICH TOUCHED UPON BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION. </p><p>IT ALSO CONVENED A MEETING IN DECEMBER 1998 OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS REPRESENTING THE G8 MEMBERS AS WELL </p><p>AS THE EU PRESIDENCY AND EU COMMISSION TO REVIEW MEASURES ON </p><p>TERRORIST FUND RAISING. </p><p> </p><p>15. BRITAIN AND THE U.S. REMAIN RESOLVED TO BRING TO JUSTICE </p><p>THE TWO LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM FLIGHT 103 OVER </p><p>LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  TO REMOVE ANY PLAUSIBLE JUSTIFICATION </p><p>LIBYA MIGHT CITE FOR FAILING PRODUCE THE SUSPECTS, THE U.S. </p><p>AND UK IN AUGUST 1998 PROPOSED AN INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD </p><p>PERMIT THE ACCUSED TO BE TRIED BEFORE A SCOTTISH COURT </p><p>SITTING IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE TRIAL, CONDUCTED BY A PANEL </p><p>OF JUDGES, WILL BE FAIR IN EVERY RESPECT AND ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>WILL BE MADE FOR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE UN SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL AND THROUGH HIS OFFICES HAVE ENSURED THE LIBYAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDS THE TERMS OF THIS GENUINE INITIATIVE. </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AWAITS DELIVERY BY LIBYA OF THE </p><p>ACCUSED FOR TRIAL AS DEMANDED BY UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS SO THIS DECADE-OLD WOUND CAN BE BROUGHT TO </p><p>CLOSURE. </p><p> </p><p>F-G) SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM OR GOVERNMENT SPONSORS TERRORISM </p><p>     --------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>16. NONE. </p><p> </p><p>H) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES </p><p>   ------------------- </p><p>17. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE APRIL 1998 GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT, </p><p>NEGOTIATED BY THE NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICAL PARTIES UNDER </p><p>THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS AGREED TO MAKE PRISONERS CONVICTED OF TERRORIST CRIMES </p><p>IN NORTHERN IRELAND ELIGIBLE FOR AN EARLY RELEASE PROGRAM. </p><p>THE RELEASES ASSUME THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS TO WHICH THE </p><p>PRISONERS BELONG WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CEASE-FIRES.  SHOULD </p><p>THE PRISONERS ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES UPON RELEASE, </p><p>THEIR "LICENSE" COULD BE REVOKED.  ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND, THE GOVERNMENT EMPHASIZES THE PROGRAM IS AN </p><p>ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE NEGOTIATION TO ACHIEVE A LASTING </p><p>PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND DOES NOT SIGNIFY A GENERAL </p><p>AMNESTY OR SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR. </p><p> </p><p>I-K)  COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION </p><p>      ---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. AT ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL FIELDS, BRITISH AND AMERICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER ON THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  CLOSE COOPERATION BASED ON INTENSIVE COORDINATION </p><p>AND CONSULTATION IS THE NORM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRADTKE </p><p></p></div>
