(C) IN A FORTY FIVE MINUTE TETE-A-TETE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND I HAD A CORDIAL BUT FRANK EXCHANGE </p><p>ON ZIMBABWE\'S DOMESTIC POLITICAL CRISIS.  I TOLD THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT, WHOM I HAVE KNOWN SINCE THE </p><p>1970\'S, THAT THERE WAS A GROWING AND WIDELY HELD </p><p>PERCEPTION, EVEN AMONG HIS COUNTRY\'S LONGEST AND </p><p>STRONGEST SUPPORTERS, THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>ABANDONED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW; WAS </p><p>COMPLICIT IN RECENT ACTS OF LAWLESSNESS AND VIOLENCE; </p><p>AND WAS CONTRIBUTING TO A CLIMATE OF INCREASED RACIAL </p><p>POLARIZATION AND DANGEROUS POLITICAL TENSION.  I TOLD </p><p>MUGABE THAT RECENT EVENTS WERE THREATENING TO IMPERIL </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE AND HIS OWN PERSONAL LEGACY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT LISTENED CLOSELY AND </p><p>APPEARED TO WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK THROUGH A </p><p>NUMBER OF HIS IMMEDIATE PREOCCUPATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>--HE WAS KEENLY AWARE OF THE IMMEDIATE DANGERS, HAD </p><p>PUBLICLY CONDEMNED THE VIOLENCE THAT HAD OCCURRED, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02206  01 OF 06  241301Z </p><p>WAS WORKING TO DEFUSE THE CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>--HIS GOVERNMENT HAD NOT ABANDONED THE RULE OF LAW, BUT </p><p>FEARED THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY POLICE OR ARMY EFFORT TO </p><p>FORCIBLY REMOVE THE WAR VETERANS WHO HAD OCCUPIED THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>--HE FELT THAT THE BRITISH HAD YET TO HOLD UP THEIR PART </p><p>OF THE BARGAIN STRUCK AT LANCASTER HOUSE, AND HAD NO </p><p>MORAL BASIS TO COMPLAIN NOW ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S INSISTENCE </p><p>THAT LONG-DELAYED LAND REFORM BE IMPLEMENTED WITH OR </p><p>WITHOUT COMPENSATION TO THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS. </p><p>AFTER ALL, IT WAS THE AFRICANS WHO HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN </p><p>FORCIBLY SEPARATED FROM THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS BY THE </p><p>WHITE SETTLERS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT APPEARED IMPLACABLY AND </p><p>UNREASONABLY HOSTILE TO HIM AND HIS GOVERNMENT. AS FAR </p><p>AS THE LAND ISSUE WAS CONCERNED, HE HAD BEEN </p><p>PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE FAILURE OF THE NEW </p><p>LABOR GOVERNMENT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS OF A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY </p><p>CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR. </p><p> </p><p>--WHILE HE STILL HOPED FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>LAND QUESTION, HE WAS DETERMINED TO ADDRESS THIS </p><p>HISTORICAL INJUSTICE ONCE AND FOR ALL. </p><p> </p><p>--HE HAD YET TO HAVE A REAL MEETING OR EXCHANGE WITH </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BLAIR AND, MORE GENERALLY, FELT SLIGHTED </p><p>BY THE NEW LABOR GOVERNMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02206  01 OF 06  241301Z </p><p> </p><p>--A ZIMBABWEAN DELEGATION WAS TRAVELLING NEXT WEEK TO </p><p>LONDON IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--MANY OF ZIMBABWE\'S WHITE FARMERS HAD NEVER RECONCILED </p><p>THEMSELVES TO A BLACK-LED ZIMBABWE.  THERE WERE, </p><p>HOWEVER, SOME NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS.  UNFORTUNATELY, ONE </p><p>PROGRESSIVE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION PRESIDENT HAD </p><p>FAILED IN HIS EFFORTS TO PERSUADE HIS COLLEAGUES TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE A BINDING SETTLEMENT THAT WOULD DEFINITIVELY </p><p>RESOLVE THE LAND ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>--HE WELCOMED THE WILLINGNESS OF THE USG GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>BE OF ASSISTANCE, BOTH IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAM AND IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE </p><p>BRITISH. </p><p> </p><p>4.
