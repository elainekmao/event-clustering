<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001469 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB, EAP AND INL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>NSC FOR RAND BEERS </p><p>MANILA FOR USED/ADB </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EAID, BM, ADB </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. SANCTIONS: DIRECTED AT BURMA OR THE REGION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action message.  See paragraph 9. </p><p> </p><p>2. Summary: The United States is now poised to oppose an ADB </p><p>regional grant for alternative development in the Greater </p><p>Mekong Subregion (GMS) on the grounds that Burma-specific </p><p>legislation applies to all such regional grants.  That </p><p>position will have wide ramifications, potentially crippling </p><p>the ADB\'s ability to support GMS loans and grants. It will </p><p>also undercut regional support for U.S. sanctions policy on </p><p>Burma and damage U.S. efforts to promote donor support for </p><p>alternative development projects in Southeast Asia.  That was </p><p>not the intent of the Burma legislation, but it will be the </p><p>effect, if the USG does not review and reverse the proposed </p><p>decision on the ADB grant.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. The ADB\'s Executive Board will shortly take up a proposed </p><p>$2 million technical assistance grant for cooperation on </p><p>alternative development for drug control in the Greater </p><p>Mekong Subregion.  As its name implies, the grant will </p><p>promote sub-regional cooperation in major opium producing </p><p>areas.  It has three basic components.  The grant will help </p><p>implement the joint China/ASEAN ACCORD plan of action on drug </p><p>control, assist in monitoring opium production, and promote </p><p>alternative development activities, including food security, </p><p>health and education programs, crop diversification, and </p><p>improved land use planning.  In Burma specifically, the </p><p>technical assistance would pick up activities from the Wa </p><p>Alternative Development Project that were cut when that </p><p>project was downsized in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>4. This grant would directly support U.S. alternative </p><p>development initiatives in Southeast Asia.  Over the past </p><p>five years, the United States has been the strongest </p><p>supporter of alternative development activities in the Golden </p><p>Triangle.  In Burma alone, the United States has contributed </p><p>over three-quarters of the donor funding for the Wa </p><p>Alternative Development project, a total of over $8 million </p><p>since 1998.  We have also lobbied strongly for broader donor </p><p>support for these programs, with some success.  Since 2000, </p><p>Japan has scaled up its support for alternative development </p><p>programs in Burma from an original grant of $500,000 to </p><p>$700,000 in 2001 and $1.673 million in 2002, almost $1 </p><p>million more than we will contribute this year.  In 2002, </p><p>Germany became the third major donor to join up, putting up </p><p>$1.25 for alternative development in the Wa territories. </p><p>Meanwhile, Thailand and China have begun planning for their </p><p>own alternative development programs with Burma. </p><p> </p><p>5. These projects, moreover, have been successful.  The Wa </p><p>Alternative Development Project in particular has contributed </p><p>to a sharp reduction in opium cultivation in the project </p><p>area.  It has also helped eliminate leprosy from the project </p><p>area, established new health and education facilities, and </p><p>helped close a food deficit which has always been a prime </p><p>motivating factor for opium production by village farmers. </p><p>In addition, it has opened a window on the Wa territories for </p><p>foreign observers, exposed the Wa to concerted international </p><p>pressure regarding drug trafficking, and directly supported </p><p>Burma\'s nationwide drug control program, which has reduced </p><p>opium production by more than 75 percent over the poast six </p><p>years; i.e., from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in 1996 to </p><p>only 630 metric tons last year. </p><p> </p><p>6. Despite this success, the United States is now proposing </p><p>to frustrate the ADB\'s efforts to get involved in alternative </p><p>development in Southeast Asia by voting against the proposed </p><p>regional grant.  Essentially, that decision was based on some </p><p>Burma-specific legislation that directs the Secretary of </p><p>Treasury to instruct the USEDs at all IFIs to vote against </p><p>"any loan or other utilization of funds .... to or for </p><p>Burma."  In this case, however, the proposed grant is not "to </p><p>or for Burma," alone.  In fact, the Government of Burma will </p><p>never see a cent of the money.  Rather, the grant will be </p><p>distributed through UNDCP for use in countries throughout the </p><p>sub-region, including China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and </p><p>Cambodia.  As a consequence, a "no" vote in this case will </p><p>have widespread ramifications.  Not only will it undercut our </p><p>efforts to promote alternative development in the Golden </p><p>Triangle, it will also effectively extend Burma-specific </p><p>sanctions to the entire Greater Mekong sub-region, </p><p>potentially outlawing any lending by the World Bank, the ADB, </p><p>or any other IFI to any type of regional project from which </p><p>Burma might benefit in any way. </p><p> </p><p>7. Such a vote would also inevitably undercut regional </p><p>support for our Burma policy.  Our sanctions policy, after </p><p>all, is intended to punish Burma, not its neighbors.  If we </p><p>persist now in extending those sanctions to all regional </p><p>collectives in which Burma participates, we will risk </p><p>alienating the very front line states whose support we need </p><p>if sanctions are to be effective.  The point is critical and </p><p>worth emphasizing.  There is no better way to undercut </p><p>regional support for our Burma policy than to apply our </p><p>sanctions collectively to all regional states.  That, </p><p>however, will be the effect of U.S. votes against regional </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>8. In short, the proposed U.S. decision to vote no on the ADB </p><p>grant can result in crippling the ability of IFIs to support </p><p>GMS loans and grants; it will undercut regional support for </p><p>U.S. sanctions policy on Burma; and it will damage U.S. </p><p>efforts to promote donor support for alternative development </p><p>projects in Southeast Asia. None of this was the intent of </p><p>the original Burma legislation; however, it will be the </p><p>effect and the USG should take time now to step back and </p><p>review its proposed decision on this ADB grant. </p><p> </p><p>9. Action requested: A "yes" vote on the ADB\'s grant for </p><p>alternative development in the Greater Mekong Subregion. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
