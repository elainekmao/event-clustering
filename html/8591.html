Gul stressed the need to modernize </p><p>Turkey\'s administration.  The reform package would allow </p><p>broadcast in Kurdish on private television channels.  Gul </p><p>said on Saturday that the government would press ahead to </p><p>enact the reforms despite objections by the military on some </p><p>controversial issues such as broadcast in languages other </p><p>than Turkish and changes to the Law on the Struggle Against </p><p>Terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan prepares letter for Bush: MFA U/S Amb. Ugur Ziyal, </p><p>who is expected to visit the U.S. later this week, will </p><p>present a letter from Prime Minister Erdogan to President </p><p>Bush, according to Turkish dailies.  Erdogan\'s letter </p><p>reportedly urges that Turkey and the U.S. forget past </p><p>disagreements and look to the future: `Turkey, which is </p><p>still facing westward, views the U.S. as a strategic </p><p>partner.  The Iraqi nation trusts Turkey, and this could be </p><p>to the advantage of the U.S.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AJC delegation visit: An American Jewish Committee (AJC) </p><p>delegation met with top-level Turkish leaders on Friday, </p><p>weekend dailies reported.  Harold Tanner, the head of the </p><p>delegation, told officials that the AJC is ready to extend </p><p>help in exchange for Turkey\'s support on regional problems. </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan vowed to boost Turkish-Israeli ties, </p><p>and said he would pay a visit to Israel soon after the </p><p>upcoming visit of Israeli President Katsav to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey wants to host Mideast peace summit: Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan and Foreign Minister Gul have called their </p><p>counterparts in Israel and Palestine, inviting them to a </p><p>prospective summit meeting in Turkey on Middle East peace. </p><p>Erdogan called Sharon on Sunday to denounce the killing of </p><p>innocent people and to express Turkey\'s strong support for </p><p>the Middle East roadmap highlighted by last week\'s summit in </p><p>Agaba.  Sharon expressed satisfaction about the level of </p><p>Israeli-Turkish ties, and said that a likely meeting on </p><p>Middle East peace should be held in Turkey, according to </p><p>Monday\'s dailies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s `changing\' Iraqi policy: Foreign Minister Gul told </p><p>"Hurriyet" in a Sunday interview that Turkey will attempt to </p><p>exert influence on Iraq via economic cooperation.  Ankara </p><p>prefers to address the Kurds via the central administration </p><p>in Baghdad, Gul said.  `Kurds are an influential part of the </p><p>new Iraq.  Kurds are our neighbors, and we will protect them </p><p>as well,\' Gul noted.  Gul is uneasy about the situation in </p><p>Kirkuk, Hurriyet claims: `A census should be held in Kirkuk </p><p>to see the actual numbers of Turkomen in the region and to </p><p>make healthier projections about Iraq\'s future,\' Gul </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) Iraq and US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It\'s time for Mahmoud Abbas" </p><p>Yasemin Congar wrote from Washington in mass appeal Milliyet </p><p>(6/9): "Mahmoud Abbas managed to portray a Palestinian </p><p>leadership which rules out acting with the `victim\' </p><p>psychology and does not try to find a justification for </p><p>terrorism. . Recent statements from both Sharon and Abbas </p><p>have provided hope.  Yet the realization of this hope </p><p>requires Abbas to disarm the Islamic Jihad, and requires </p><p>Sharon to resettle the illegal residents in the West Bank. </p><p>In any case, we should be prepared for actions to undermine </p><p>the peace effort from terrorist organizations as well as the </p><p>Israeli right wing.  Ankara, like any capital in the world </p><p>that believes in the necessity of a Palestinian state as </p><p>well as Israel\'s security needs, should be pleased with </p><p>President Bush\'s involvement in the peace process.  Ankara </p><p>should also search for ways to contribute to this process. </p><p>Establishing a dialogue with Abbas and his cabinet, for </p><p>example, is one way to make such a contribution." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey sees the realities of northern Iraq" </p><p>Ilnur Cevik wrote in the English language Turkish Daily News </p><p>(6/9): "At last Ankara decided to set aside its prejudices </p><p>and fears and send a Foreign Ministry delegation comprised </p><p>of prominent ambassadors on a fact-finding mission to </p><p>northern Iraq.  The delegation came back with important </p><p>findings that confirm what we have been saying for the past </p><p>decade.  Ankara has reportedly decided to ease some of its </p><p>`red lines\' on Iraq, to take a softer line toward the Kurds, </p><p>and to treat all groups in Iraq equally, without showing </p><p>favoritism toward the Turkmen.  That is welcome news for the </p><p>Iraqi Kurds who, like the Turkmen, regard themselves as our </p><p>relatives.  Let us hope that the powerful military in Turkey </p><p>shares the views of the government regarding the </p><p>conciliatory mood toward the Kurds and the change of heart </p><p>on Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
