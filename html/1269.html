REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A SEPTEMBER 5 CONVERSATION WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, FORMER COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER -- AND </p><p>MUGABE CONFIDANT -- NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA PROVIDED A SHORT </p><p>READOUT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S VISIT TO TRIPOLI THE WEEK </p><p>OF AUGUST 28.  ACCORDING TO SHAMUYARIRA (WHO WAS PART OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN DELEGATION), MUGABE ASKED LIBYAN LEADER </p><p>KHADAFY IN A PRIVATE MEETING TO HELP MEET ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>CRITICAL FUEL NEEDS.  KHADAFY REPORTEDLY AGREED TO SEND A </p><p>TECHNICAL TEAM IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS TO DISCUSS WITH </p><p>NOCZIM, ZIMBABWE\'S NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, POSSIBLE </p><p>PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE.  ASKED WHETHER KHADAFY HAD </p><p>AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO THE GOZ FOR FUEL </p><p>PURCHASES, SHAMUYARIRA ANSWERED YES, BUT ADDED THAT NO </p><p>SPECIFIC TERMS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED. </p><p> </p><p>2.

(C) COMMENT: WE ARE VERY SKEPTICAL THAT KHADAFY </p><p>COMMITTED LIBYA TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO THE GOZ FOR </p><p>FUEL IMPORTS.  THIS IS ONLY THE MOST RECENT OF REPEATED </p><p>GOZ REQUESTS FOR HELP ON ENERGY NEEDS AND OTHER MATTERS </p><p>FROM LIBYA.  AS IN THE PAST, WE SUSPECT THAT LIBYA IS </p><p>WILLING TO PROVIDE FUEL TO ZIMBABWE ON COMMERCIAL, NOT </p><p>PHILANTHROPIC, TERMS.  WE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SUFFICIENT PAYMENT </p><p>GUARANTEES TO SATISFY THE VISITING LIBYAN TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p>N </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
