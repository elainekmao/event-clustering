<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 002291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENUTTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, KIRF, IT, PHUM, PREL, KIRF, IT, VT, RU, VTPGOV, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: RUSSIANS IN ROME SAY ORTHODOX/VATICAN TENSIONS ARE </p><p>AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN YEARS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS, DCM </p><p>MET SEPARATELY WITH FATHER MARCEL GUARNIZO,     PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE AID TO THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA, FATHER FILIPP OF THE RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROME, AND DIMITRI SHTODIN, DCM AT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02291  01 OF 02  101502Z </p><p>RUSSIAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE.  ALL ASSERT THAT </p><p>RUSSIAN/VATICAN RELATIONS ARE AT A 10-YEAR LOW.  FATHER </p><p>MARCEL BLAMES IT ON THE INCREASING INSECURITY OF PATRIARCH </p><p>ALEXI AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX "FOREIGN MINISTER" KYRILL. FATHER </p><p>FILIPP STATES THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S </p><p>"AGGRESSIVE" PROSELYTISM, WHILE SHTODIN SEES IT AS A </p><p>MANIFESTATION OF AN ETHNIC RUSSIAN/ETHNIC POLE CONFRONTATION </p><p>WITHIN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.  NONE OF THE THREE SEE ANY </p><p>SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENT.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>THE VIEW OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROME WAS A SMALL, </p><p>DISCREET CONGREGATION UNTIL THE LATE 1980\'S.  FOUNDED BY </p><p>"WHITE RUSSIANS", IT USE TO EASILY ACCOMMODATE ITS LESS THAN </p><p>300 MEMBERS IN ITS CHURCH LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF ROME. </p><p>HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF SERBS, RUSSIANS, AND </p><p>UKRAINIANS INTO ROME SINCE THE EARLY 1990\'S, THERE WERE OVER </p><p>1,000 PEOPLE AT ORTHODOX EASTER SUNDAY MASS ON MAY 5, WITH </p><p>THE OVERFLOW CROWD FILLING THE SURROUNDING STREETS.  THE </p><p>CONGREGATION HOPES TO HAVE A SECOND CHURCH BUILDING ON THE </p><p>RUSSIAN EMBASSY COMPOUND IN 2003, WHERE A LARGE CHURCH IS </p><p>CURRENTLY BEING CONSTRUCTED.  THERE ARE THREE PRIESTS AT THE </p><p>CHURCH, FATHER FILIPP, FATHER MIKAIL, AND FATHER ALEKSEY. DCM </p><p>MET MOST RECENTLY WITH FATHER FILIPP ON MAY 6 TO DISCUSS HIS </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN EMBASSY\'S MAY 15-16 ANTI TRAFFICKING </p><p>CONFERENCE.  FATHER FILIPP AGAIN USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>COMPLAIN ABOUT VATICAN ACTIONS IN RUSSIA.  HE SAID THAT THERE </p><p>WILL BE NO IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS UNTIL POPE JOHN PAUL II </p><p>"LEAVES THE SCENE".  HE SAID THAT THE CREATION OF CATHOLIC </p><p>DIOCESE IN RUSSIA WAS A GREAT "INSULT" TO THE RUSSIAN CHURCH. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02291  01 OF 02  101502Z </p><p> WHEN ASKED IF THESE WERE NOT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE PASTORAL </p><p>CARE FOR CATHOLICS LIVING IN RUSSIA, HE REPLIED THAT THIS </p><p>ARGUMENT IS A VATICAN "LIE" AND COVER FOR AGGRESSIVE </p><p>PROSTYELATION OF RUSSIANS.  HE DESCRIBED RELATIONS AS WORSE </p><p>THAN ANYTIME IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>VIEW OF THE EMBASSY OF RUSSIA TO THE HOLY SEE </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DURING SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS WITH RUSSIAN EMBASSY DCM </p><p>SHTODIN, DCM RAISED STATE OF RUSSIAN/VATICAN RELATIONS. </p><p>SHTODIN, WHO VOLUNTEERED THAT HE IS A NON BELIEVER AND DID </p><p>NOT FEEL PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, AGREED </p><p>ENTIRELY WITH THE SENTIMENTS VOICED BY FATHER FILIPP. HE SAW </p><p>NOT ONLY THE CREATION OF DIOCESES AS AN AFFRONT, BUT WHAT HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS THE RECENT VATICAN "VIRTUAL INVASION" OF MOSCOW. </p><p> ACCORDING TO SHTODIN, THE RUSSIANS WERE INFORMED THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN WOULD DO A LIVE VIDEO LINK FOR THE POPE WITH </p><p>SEMINARIANS AT THE CATHEDRAL IN MOSCOW.  THE ARCHBISHOP OF </p><p>MOSCOW, AGAIN ACCORDING TO SHTODIN, MADE IT A PUBLIC EVENT. </p><p>SHTODIN SEES BOTH ETHNICITY AND POLITICS AT WORK ON THE </p><p>VATICAN SIDE.  HE SAID THAT A MAJORITY OF ROMAN CATHOLICS IN </p><p>RUSSIA ARE ETHNIC POLES, AND THAT THOSE IN THE VATICAN WHO </p><p>WANT TO RETARD PROGRESS IN VATICAN/RUSSIA RELATIONS ARE </p><p>TELLING THE POPE THAT HIS CO-NATIONALS IN RUSSIA ARE BEING </p><p>PERSECUTED AND THE VATICAN SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE AN </p><p>AGGRESSIVE STAND.      HE SINGLED OUT PRIME MINISTER SODANO </p><p>AS BEHIND THESE ACTIONS, NOT BECAUSE HE\'S CONCERNED WITH </p><p>POLISH CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA, BUT TO GAIN SUPPORT IN </p><p>ANTICIPATION OF THE NEXT CONCLAVE AMONG CARDINALS LOYAL TO </p><p>JOHN PAUL. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02291  01 OF 02  101502Z </p><p>A ROMAN CATHOLIC\'S VIEW </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FATHER MARCEL, PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED </p><p>"AID TO THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA",  CALLED ON DCM ON    MAY 1. </p><p>HE SAID THAT PERSECUTION OF ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA IS AT </p><p>ITS WORST LEVEL SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THERE IS NO PROSELYTIZING, BUT IF AN ETHNIC RUSSIAN WANTS TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE CATHOLICISM "HE MUST BE RECEIVED".  MARCEL </p><p>STRESSED THAT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PASTORAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA, IT IS NECESSARY FOR FOREIGN </p><p>BISHOPS AND PRIESTS TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.  HE </p><p>MADE A STRONG PLEA FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TO MEET ARCHBISHOP </p><p>TADEUSZ KONDRUSIEWICZ OF MOSCOW DURING THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>UPCOMING TRIP TO RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  POST WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING FROM EMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>IF SHTODIN\'S PERSPECTIVE IS SHARED BY MANY IN THE GOI. </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN IS CONVINCED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS LEGITIMATE </p><p>PASTORAL CONCERNS IN RUSSIA WHICH NECESSITATE THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>FOREIGN PRIESTS.  THAT SAID, THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT </p><p>THE VATICAN IS CALLING FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF PRIESTS PER </p><p>CATHOLIC CONGREGANTS THAN IS THE NORM IN WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  AGAIN, EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S VIEW WOULD BE WELCOMED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7246 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02291  02 OF 02  101502Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------ACCCDA  101502Z /38 </p><p>O 101442Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 002291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENUTTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, KIRF, IT, RU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: RUSSIANS IN ROME SAY ORTHODOX/VATICAN TENSIONS ARE </p><p>AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN YEARS </p><p> </p><p>END COMMENT.
