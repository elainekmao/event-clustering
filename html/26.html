<p>S E C R E T MOGADISHU 01292 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DNG: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINT, SO </p><p>SUBJ: LIBYAN ACTIVITY IN AFRICA: SOMALIA </p><p> </p><p>REFS: STATE 7202 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2. THE FOLLOWING IS IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS </p><p>POSED IN PARAGRAPH FIVE OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SOMALIA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4. SOMALIA HAS NO OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH LIBYA. </p><p>THE GSDR VIEWS QADHAFI AS AN ENEMY BECAUSE HE </p><p>SUPPORTS THE SOMALI DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS TRYING </p><p>TO BRING DOWN THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT.   THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN RUMORS RECENTLY OF TENTATIVE CONTACTS BETWEEN </p><p>SOMALIA AND LIBYA ABOUT RESTORING RELATIONS. </p><p>ITALIANS HAVE TOLD US THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER </p><p>WAY ABOUT PLACING A SOMALI DIPLOMAT IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI AND A LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN THE </p><p>YUGOSLAV EMBASSY IN MOGADISHU.  IT SEEMS LIKELY, </p><p>IF TRUE, THAT PRESIDENT SIAD WILL TRY TO USE THE </p><p>LIBYANS\' DESIRE FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS AS A LEVER </p><p>TO PERSUADE THEM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE DISSIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5. OVERT OPPOSITION TO THE SIAD REGIME IS CENTERED </p><p>ON TWO DISSIDENT GROUPS, THE SOMALI NATIONAL </p><p>MOVEMENT (SNM) AND THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC SALVATION </p><p>FRONT (SDSF), WHICH ARE HEADQUARTERED IN ADDIS </p><p>ABABA AND OPERATE AGAINST SOMALIA OUT OF ETHIOPIA. </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND LIBYA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THESE GROUPS </p><p>FOR SEVERAL YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6. LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE DISSIDENTS HAS BEEN </p><p>CONSTRAINED ON OCCASION BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS\' </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO MERGE AS QADHAFI DESIRES OR TO FOLLOW </p><p>A MORE RADICAL IDEOLOGICAL LINE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7. AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE GSDR IS UNLIKELY TO </p><p>SUPPORT LIBYAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN </p><p>AFRICA EXCEPT AGAINST ETHIOPIA.  OVER THE PAST </p><p>YEAR, SOMALIA PUBLICLY HAS CRITICIZED LIBYAN </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN CHAD AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA, AS WELL </p><p>AS LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE SNM AND THE SDSF. </p><p>HOWEVER, SOMALIA DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO </p><p>ASSIST ANY COUNTRY THREATENED BY THE LIBYANS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8. THE FACT THAT SOMALIA AND LIBYA ARE BOTH ISLAMIC </p><p>COUNTRIES IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THEIR </p><p>RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9. ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN SOMALIA AND LIBYA IS </p><p>POSSIBLE IF LIBYAN FORCES WERE TO BE SENT TO </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND TOOK UP POSITIONS ALONG THE BORDER </p><p>WITH SOMALIA.  WE BELIEVE THAT FULL-SCALE WAR </p><p>BETWEEN SOMALIA AND ETHIOPIA IS UNLIKELY.  CROSS </p><p>BORDER SKIRMISHES, HOWEVER, ARE RECURRENT AND </p><p>POSSIBLE LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD MEAN ADDING A NEW ELEMENT </p><p>TO THE CURRENT SOVIET/CUBAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN ETHIOPIA. </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
