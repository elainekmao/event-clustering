<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETRD, MARR, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI YUPPIES LOOK BEYOND THE LONG-AWAITED WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 1105 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 1056 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: Where reftels analyzed how the US-led war against </p><p>Iraq might affect Kuwait\'s  political and economic landscape </p><p>in general, this cable examines perceptions of a specific </p><p>sector of society -- young, upwardly-mobile, </p><p>democratically-minded professionals.  At an informal dinner, </p><p>EmbOffs met with a group of thirty-something Kuwaiti men to </p><p>discuss the war\'s impact on their country, now and in the </p><p>future.  Like others in their demographic, they have lived </p><p>nearly half their lives under the shadow of a brutally </p><p>hostile neighbor.  Most of them wanted this war, but now that </p><p>it is here, what next?  As Saddam\'s regime nears its end, </p><p>these potential leaders of tomorrow were eager to voice their </p><p>opinions on a wide range of topics, from the war to the </p><p>economy to Kuwait\'s relationship with the United States and </p><p>its growing feeling of isolation in the Arab World.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>FOOD FOR THOUGHT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ConOff, EconOff, and PolOff met March 27 for dinner with </p><p>ten liberal, pro-Western Kuwaitis to discuss their views on </p><p>how the war could affect Kuwait politically (ref A) and </p><p>economically (ref B).  This gathering included lawyers, </p><p>businessmen, investors, and media professionals, each </p><p>financially well off by American standards (BMWs and Jaguars </p><p>in the driveway), but none members of Kuwait\'s ruling family </p><p>or upper elite class.  A few studied in the US and each </p><p>graduated from Kuwait University, where they launched and </p><p>remain active in a liberal student group called the </p><p>"Democratic Circle."  All but two arrived in Western dress, </p><p>the pair in dishdashas (traditional robes) quickly discarding </p><p>their headgear to better fit in. </p><p> </p><p>3. Their views on the conflict ran the gamut from Rambo-esque </p><p>to anti-war, but all agreed Saddam must go (one hawk asked </p><p>"Why it had taken us so long," while even the lone dove was </p><p>in favor of his removal).  Each participant appeared </p><p>well-informed and well-engaged in television coverage of the </p><p>war, viewing several hours of news a day.  Each said he </p><p>watched a variety of television sources, from Al-Jazeera, Abu </p><p>Dhabi TV, and other Arabic-language channels to CNN, Fox, </p><p>BBC, and SkyNews.  Most were critical of Al-Jazeera, but at </p><p>least one praised it for carrying information otherwise not </p><p>available.  Most were also critical of CNN, stating that it </p><p>was repetitive and had lost much of its edge since the Gulf </p><p>War.  All expressed a vested interest in the outcome of this </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>WAR\'S TOLL </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. While this group readily acknowledged the economic </p><p>prospects for Kuwait following Iraq\'s liberation (ref B), </p><p>their primary interest centered on the political </p><p>ramifications -- namely, the impact this war was having on </p><p>Kuwait\'s relations with other Arab states.  Each participant </p><p>voiced concern over Kuwait\'s growing isolation in the Arab </p><p>world.  Some noted with bitterness how no Arab nation had </p><p>stood up for Kuwait while Iraq was launching missiles into </p><p>its territory.  (Note: Local press reported March 30 that </p><p>Saudi Arabia and Morocco finally deplored Iraq\'s actions, but </p><p>only after a missile actually struck a Kuwaiti target the </p><p>previous day.) </p><p> </p><p>5. Others complained even more acrimoniously how Kuwait </p><p>routinely lent a money-laden hand to its Arab neighbors, yet </p><p>none were standing behind Kuwait in its hour of need.  As one </p><p>participant said, "We\'ve given millions, for what?"  Others </p><p>questioned the value of the Arab League, one calling it a </p><p>"burden to Kuwait."  Some said they would not be surprised if </p><p>the GOK refused to attend the next Arab League meeting. </p><p>(Note: During the March 31 session of Kuwait\'s National </p><p>Assembly, Members of Parliament railed against Arab League </p><p>Secretary General Amr Mousa and the several Arab countries </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that refused to issue statements denouncing Iraq.  A proposal </p><p>now before the National Assembly would require parliamentary </p><p>approval of any further financial aid to Arab states. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ODD MAN OUT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Most participants agreed that lack of Arab support went </p><p>beyond envy over Kuwait\'s oil wealth to fears of a </p><p>significant challenge to the status quo.  They singled out </p><p>Syria, Egypt, and Libya as countries where autocratic leaders </p><p>were especially fearful of a new order, one in which the USG </p><p>established Iraq as a democracy to be followed by other </p><p>states in the region.  They agreed Kuwait was hated for its </p><p>support of the United States, but even more so for being a </p><p>democracy.  (Note: An interesting dichotomy exists here, in </p><p>which Kuwaitis pride themselves on the one hand for being </p><p>democratic, while acknowledging on the other that women and </p><p>most men still do not have the right to vote. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. Even within Kuwait, the status quo was coming under </p><p>threat, they said.  One participant told how he and other </p><p>members of the "Democratic Circle" were branded as communists </p><p>and atheists by the Islamist student group as a way to </p><p>discount their liberal ideas.  Even so, these ideas were </p><p>permeating Kuwaiti society, especially among the younger, </p><p>media savvy "Internet generation," another participant said. </p><p>Nevertheless, the participants agreed that the Islamists on </p><p>campus -- as well as in larger Kuwaiti society -- remain </p><p>better organized and funded than their liberal counterparts, </p><p>with a clear and singular message (religion) that is easier </p><p>for many to grasp.  Recent gender segregation at Kuwait </p><p>University demonstrates the potent Islamist influence. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LOOKING AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. The participants expected economic opportunities to follow </p><p>Iraq\'s liberation, especially in nearby Basra, where some of </p><p>them have relatives.  Such a development, however, did not </p><p>seem a central focus of this group, in comparison to their </p><p>older, more established, and better connected compatriots, </p><p>such as from the ruling al-Sabah or large merchant families. </p><p> Instead, they spoke of strong economic possibilities in </p><p>Kuwait.  They said there was much money to be made in real </p><p>estate, oil, and other investments.  They noted, however, </p><p>that most Kuwaitis continue to think along short term lines, </p><p>not willing to risk longer term investments.  They agreed </p><p>with EmbOff that such thinking was hurting Kuwait\'s </p><p>development, but did not expect to see this behavior change </p><p>any time soon, even after Iraq opens up for business. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Whatever happens next, this group hoped that the US </p><p>military would maintain a strong presence in the country. </p><p>One participant said that at least for the foreseeable future </p><p>Kuwait will need protection against historically </p><p>expansion-minded countries like Iraq, Iran, and even Saudi </p><p>Arabia.  Others stated America has proven it is the only </p><p>country Kuwait can really trust.  They tended to agree the </p><p>safety provided by the United States far outweighed the </p><p>condemnation and isolation from their Arab brothers. </p><p> </p><p>10.  One area where this group fell in line with the majority </p><p>of their countrymen was on Middle East peace.  Despite being </p><p>educated, open-minded, and fully aware of how the </p><p>Palestinians had twice sided with Saddam against Kuwait, </p><p>members of the group were still critical over what one called </p><p>"America\'s unquestioned support" for Israel.  They were not </p><p>willing to admit that at least the USG was working to resolve </p><p>this impasse, when most Arab nations are not, and trying to </p><p>engage them in an objective discussion on this topic seemed a </p><p>non-starter. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  While these remarks admittedly reflect the opinions of a </p><p>small group of Kuwaiti men, they can also be seen as </p><p>incorporating a wider view held by a segment of society that </p><p>figures to be among the economic, legal, and perhaps even </p><p>political leaders of tomorrow.  Their ardent support for the </p><p>United States -- not only its military might, but more </p><p>importantly its democratic ideals -- in face of the wrath </p><p>this relationship garners from Kuwait\'s Arab neighbors, is </p><p>encouraging; we will endeavor to nurture it. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
