WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE (GOSL) HAS DECLARED MOST </p><p>CHIEFDOMS SAFE FOR RETURN AND OVER 76,000 </p><p>IDPS/RETURNEES WERE RESETTLED IN 2001, SOME CHIEFDOMS </p><p>OF KONO AND KAILAHUN DISTRICTS REMAIN UNSAFE FOR </p><p>RETURN.

JANUARY 27 THROUGH FEBRUARY 7, SENIOR EMERGENCY </p><p>COORDINATOR (SEC) IN THE U.S. MISSION/ROME REGINA </p><p>DAVIS AND DALE SKORIC, USAID/DCHA/FOOD FOR PEACE </p><p>OFFICER (FFPO), TRAVELED TO GUINEA, SIERRA LEONE, AND </p><p>LIBERIA TO REVIEW THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION FOR </p><p>REFUGEES, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), AND </p><p>RETURNEES.  WFP\'S DEPUTY FOR THE WEST AFRICA REGION, </p><p>ARNOLD VERCKEN, ACCOMPANIED THE USAID TEAM TO ALL </p><p>THREE COUNTRIES.  THE TEAM ALSO GOT THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO DISCUSS REFUGEE OPERATIONS WITH BRUCE KNOTTS, </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT REGIONAL REFUGEE COORDINATOR (REF </p><p>COORD), DURING ITS TIME IN SIERRA LEONE. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE TEAM MET WITH WFP/SIERRA LEONE (SL), THE THREE </p><p>FOOD PIPELINE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE </p><p>U.N. FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION (FAO), AND </p><p>TRAVELED TO THE DISTRICTS OF KAMBIA IN THE NORTHWEST </p><p>(BORDERING FORECARIAH REGION OF GUINEA) AND KAILAHUN </p><p>IN THE EAST BORDERING THE LANGUETTE REGION OF GUINEA </p><p>AND ALSO CLOSE TO LIBERIA.  IN KAILAHUN DISTRICT, THE </p><p>USAID TEAM VISITED AN IMPROMPTU, UNOFFICIAL LIBERIAN </p><p>REFUGEE CAMP LOCATED IN BUEDU, SEVERAL KILOMETERS </p><p>FROM THE LIBERIAN BORDER, AND WENT TO DARU TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>5. OVER THE PAST DECADE, SIERRA LEONE HAS SUFFERED </p><p>FROM A BRUTAL CIVIL WAR.  THE CONFLICT HAS BOTH ADDED </p><p>TO AND BEEN FUELED BY UNREST WITHIN THE SUB-REGION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  02 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>THE CURRENT CEASE-FIRE AND DISARMAMENT PROCESS, </p><p>OVERSEEN BY 17,500 U.N. MISSION IN SIERRA LEONE </p><p>(UNAMSIL) TROOPS DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, HAS </p><p>ALLOWED ACCESS TO MANY PREVIOUSLY INSECURE AREAS. </p><p>INCREASED ACCESS HAS ENCOURAGED RETURN OF REFUGEES </p><p>AND IDPS AND HAS PROMPTED THE GOSL TO LAUNCH ITS </p><p>RESETTLEMENT STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE SEC VISITED GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME LAST YEAR WHEN THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>UNREST ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN SIERRA LEONE AND </p><p>GUINEA (REF TEL A).  MANY SIERRA LEONEAN REFUGEES </p><p>WERE RETURNING TO SIERRA LEONE FROM GUINEA, BUT THEIR </p><p>ACTUAL HOME AREA(S) WERE UNSAFE FOR RETURN.  RETURNEE </p><p>CAMPS WERE BUILT AS AN INTERIM MEASURE.  AS MANY OF </p><p>THE RETURNEES CAME FROM THE DISTRICTS OF KONO AND </p><p>KAILAHUN, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER REMAIN IN THE INTERIM </p><p>CAMPS TODAY.  THOSE COMING FROM OTHER DISTRICTS </p><p>WITHIN SIERRA LEONE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO </p><p>THEIR HOME DISTRICTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION AND REINTEGRATION PROGRAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7. THE GOVERNMENT\'S NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR </p><p>DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILISATION AND REINTEGRATION (NCDDR) </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE DDR PROGRAM. </p><p>WHILE EARLIER CONSTRAINED, PROGRESS UNDER THE DDR </p><p>PROGRAM SINCE MAY 2001 HAS BEEN EXTREMELY RAPID. </p><p>SINCE JANUARY 2001, OVER 46,000 COMBATANTS HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  02 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>TURNED IN SOME 14,500 WEAPONS AND 1.3 MILLION ROUNDS </p><p>OF AMMUNITION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP HAS TARGETED 2,574 FEMALE AND 23,161 MALE EX- </p><p>COMBATANTS WITH 414 METRIC TONS (MT) OF FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE, BUT ANTICIPATES THAT ALL ITS COMMITMENTS </p><p>FOR THE DDR PROGRAM WILL BE SATISFIED BY THE END OF </p><p>MARCH 2002, AT WHICH TIME THIS PROJECT WILL BE </p><p>OFFICIALLY CLOSED.  THEREAFTER, THE TRUE CHALLENGE </p><p>WILL BE TO FIND ACTIVITIES FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>THE DEMOBILIZED COMBATANTS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY WHERE LITTLE INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>OR CAPACITY EXISTS.  IN THIS REGARD, THE FOUR </p><p>USAID/FFP-SUPPORTED FOOD PIPELINE AGENCIES (FPAS), </p><p>NAMELY WFP, CARE, CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS) AND </p><p>WORLD VISION, HAVE DESIGNED FOOD-FOR-WORK (FFW) </p><p>PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO AREAS UNDERGOING </p><p>HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF PHYSICAL </p><p>COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN EARLY JANUARY, THE FFW PROJECTS WERE NOTED BY </p><p>BOTH THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE GOSL AS A MAJOR </p><p>CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REINTEGRATION PROCESS.  THE FPAS </p><p>PLAN TO EXPAND THEIR EFFORTS IN 2002 TO MAXIMIZE THE </p><p>GAINS IN THE CURRENT PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT.  THESE </p><p>SUPPORTED ACTIVITIES SHOULD NOT BE ERODED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AT THE SAME TIME DURING 2001, 2,758 DISARMED </p><p>CHILD COMBATANTS ENTERED UNICEF INTERIM CARE CENTERS </p><p>(ICCS).  WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY (AORS), ALL FPAS PROVIDED A FULL FOOD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  03 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>RATION OF 2,100 KILOCALORIES (KC) PER DAY PER CHILD </p><p>IN THE ICCS PENDING REUNIFICATION WITH FAMILIES OR </p><p>ASSIGNMENT TO FOSTER HOMES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>216 STILL IN THE ICCS AND 284 IN ALTERNATIVE CARE </p><p>(I.E. FOSTER HOMES OR INDEPENDENT LIVING </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS), ALL THE CHILDREN WERE REUNIFIED WITH </p><p>FAMILIES BY THE END OF 2001.  A MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>CHILDREN ALSO ENTERED A COMMUNITY EDUCATION </p><p>INVESTMENT PROGRAM WITH SOME RECEIVING SKILLS </p><p>TRAINING SUPPORTED BY NCDDR. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RESETTLEMENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  DURING LATE 2001 AND INTO 2002, THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION IMPROVED IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PROVINCES.  SUCH STABLE PHYSICAL </p><p>CONDITIONS HAVE PROMPTED A STEADY RETURN TO NEWLY- </p><p>DECLARED SAFE AREAS.  PARTS OF THE EASTERN AND </p><p>NORTHERN PROVINCES REMAIN INSECURE WHERE POPULATION </p><p>MOVEMENTS SEEM TO BE LESS FLUID, NOT ONLY DUE TO </p><p>INSECURITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF BAD ROADS, POOR TRADE </p><p>LINKS, MARKET INACCESSIBILITY, AND LOW PURCHASING </p><p>POWER. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ALTHOUGH THE GOSL IS ANXIOUS FOR ALL REFUGEES </p><p>AND IDPS TO RETURN TO THEIR HOME AREAS, THE U.N. HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) AND WFP MAINTAIN A </p><p>POLICY THAT VOLUNTARY RETURN BE CARRIED OUT UNDER </p><p>CONDITIONS OF SAFETY AND DIGNITY.  UNHCR HAS ISSUED A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  03 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>STATEMENT CLARIFYING THAT IT WILL FACILITATE </p><p>VOLUNTARY REFUGEE REPATRIATION ONLY TO AREAS ASSESSED </p><p>TO BE SAFE FOR RETURN BY UNHCR.  RETURNEES </p><p>ORIGINATING FROM INSECURE AREAS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE INTERIM SITES.  THOSE </p><p>WHO WISH TO RETURN HOME FROM A THIRD COUNTRY ARE </p><p>TRANSPORTED TO THE NEAREST SAFE AREA.  AS OF FEBRUARY </p><p>1, THERE WERE 36,892 SIERRA LEONEAN RETURNEES IN THE </p><p>FOUR INTERIM SETTLEMENTS OF JEMBE, GERRIHUN, TAIAMA </p><p>AND BANDAJUMA.  THERE ARE ALSO 125,000 IDPS </p><p>REGISTERED IN CAMPS AND WITH HOST FAMILIES AND </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 107,000 REGISTERED SIERRA LEONEAN </p><p>REFUGEES IN THE REGION, WITH OVER 93,000 LOCATED IN </p><p>GUINEA AND LIBERIA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>COMMITTEE ON FOOD AID/COORDINATION AMONG THE FPAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  IN THE FOOD AID SECTOR, THE FPAS HAVE DEVELOPED </p><p>POLICIES AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE UNIFORM AND </p><p>CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD AID PROGRAMS.  THE </p><p>MECHANISM FOR COLLABORATION IS THE COMMITTEE ON FOOD </p><p>AID (CFA).  THE CFA MEMBERSHIP IS COMPOSED OF SENIOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FPAS, MAJOR FOOD AID DONORS, </p><p>OCHA, FAO, THE GOSL, AND CHAIRED BY WFP.  UNHCR HAS </p><p>OBSERVER STATUS.  THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED </p><p>GEOGRAPHICALLY INTO FOUR AORS WHERE EACH FPA HAS THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING NEEDED FOOD RESOURCES </p><p>WITHIN ITS AOR.  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS REGARDING </p><p>SHARING OF GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS ARE DEVELOPED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  04 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>BILATERALLY BY THE AGENCIES INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ALTHOUGH THE FPAS SEEM TO HAVE ESTABLISHED A </p><p>WORKABLE SYSTEM AMONG THEMSELVES REGARDING THE </p><p>SHARING OF GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS, MAKING ALTERATIONS TO </p><p>AN AOR IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX AS TIME GOES </p><p>ON.  FOR EXAMPLE, CRS IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A FFW </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM IN KAMBIA DISTRICT, WHICH IS </p><p>THE AOR OF WFP.  BECAUSE CRS IS THE SPONSOR OF THE </p><p>PROJECT, CRS WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE ITS OWN FOOD FOR </p><p>THE FFW, BUT SINCE THE PROJECT IS IN WFP\'S AOR, CRS </p><p>MUST ASK WFP\'S PERMISSION TO DO SO.  ON THE SURFACE, </p><p>CRS PROVIDING ITS FOOD FOR ITS PROJECT WOULD SEEM TO </p><p>BE FAR SIMPLER THAN HAVING WFP DELIVER THE FOOD TO </p><p>THE PROJECT, BUT WHEN SUCH A REQUEST IS MULTIPLIED BY </p><p>OTHER LIKE REQUESTS, IT CAN BECOME QUITE COMPLICATED. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE IRONY IS THAT WFP IS SUFFERING PIPELINE </p><p>PROBLEMS AND HAS ASKED CRS FOR A LOAN, SO IN ESSENCE </p><p>WFP WOULD BE PROVIDING CRS ITS OWN FOOD IN ORDER TO </p><p>MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE AORS.  FLEXIBILITY ON </p><p>THESE MATTERS IS OBVIOUSLY NEEDED.  (NOTE:  THE USAID </p><p>TEAM WAS ASKED MORE THAN ONCE FOR ITS VIEW ABOUT </p><p>LOANS TO WFP.  FPAS ARE BECOMING RELUCTANT TO LEND </p><p>WFP FOOD COMMODITIES DUE TO WFP\'S UNCERTAIN/WEAK </p><p>PIPELINE.  PLEASE SEE PARAS 45-48 BELOW REGARDING </p><p>PIPELINE INFORMATION. END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>16.  UPDATED EACH YEAR, THE CFA STRATEGY FOR 2002 IS </p><p>TO BE FINALIZED IN MARCH 2002.  PARTICULARLY FOR </p><p>2003, THE CFA MUST DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  04 OF 13  070643Z </p><p>FOOD AID.  THE CFA WILL ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>CLOSELY MONITOR THE SHORT AND MIDTERM IMPACT OF FOOD </p><p>AID NOW BEING PROVIDED IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINST </p><p>CREATING DISINCENTIVES TO LOCAL AGRICULTURE.  THE CFA </p><p>IS THE ONLY NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION (I.E. WFP) AND THUS THE </p><p>CFA NEEDS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH FAO AND THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL NGOS, AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT IT </p><p>ENCOURAGES AND BUILDS THE GOSL CAPACITY SO IT CAN </p><p>TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FORMULATION OF </p><p>APPROPRIATE FOOD AID STRATEGIES AND POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ASSESSING NEEDS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  IN THE FALL OF 2001, MARK LAWRENCE FROM SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN/UK TRAINED WFP INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL STAFF </p><p>IN THE FOOD ECONOMY ASSESSMENT (FEA) METHODOLOGY. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE TRAINING, WFP STAFF IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>STAFF FROM THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, MINISTRY OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, AND AFRICARE CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY FOOD </p><p>SECURITY PROFILING (CFSP) ASSESSMENT IN SIX FOOD </p><p>ECONOMY AREAS IN WFP\'S AOR FROM NOVEMBER 11 TO </p><p>DECEMBER 3.  THE AIM WAS TO EXPLORE AND DEFINE THE </p><p>CAUSES, SEASONALITY, AND LEVELS OF FOOD VULNERABILITY </p><p>AMONG SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. </p><p>THE RESULTS FROM WFP\'S WORK HIGHLIGHTED THE MAIN </p><p>RISKS AND CONSTRAINTS THAT PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM </p><p>BREAKING OUT OF THE VULNERABILITY CYCLE.  THE </p><p>FINDINGS WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES ON WFP\'S 2002 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  05 OF 13  070644Z </p><p>OPERATIONS, BENEFICIARY TARGETING, AND MONITORING AND </p><p>EVALUATION OF PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  ALTHOUGH SUCH INFORMATION IS CRUCIAL IN </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION IN SIERRA </p><p>LEONE AND THE FEA MODEL IS A GOOD ONE, THE USAID TEAM </p><p>WAS DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT WFP HAD NEITHER </p><p>INVOLVED THE FPAS IN THE PROCESS, NOR HAD KEPT THEM </p><p>INFORMED OF ITS PLANS. UNICEF AND FAO WERE ALSO NOT </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE WORK.  CONSEQUENTLY ONLY WFP\'S AOR </p><p>HAS BEEN ANALYZED BY THE CFSP, AND THEREFORE A </p><p>COUNTRY-WIDE PERSPECTIVE ON FOOD SECURITY IS MISSING </p><p>AT THIS TIME. PROGRESS NEEDS TO BE MADE ON OBTAINING </p><p>FOOD SECURITY DATA ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY USING THE </p><p>SAME METHODOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>19.  BEING LOCKED OUT OF THE CFSP PROCESS FROM THE </p><p>BEGINNING, THE OTHER FPAS TOLD THE FFPO AND SEC THEY </p><p>ARE WILLING TO BE BROUGHT ON BOARD TO THE CFSP.  THE </p><p>TEAM DISCUSSED WFP\'S LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH ITS </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND RECOMMENDED THAT EFFORTS BE MADE TO BE </p><p>MORE TRANSPARENT AND COMMUNICATIVE.   WFP AGREED THAT </p><p>FURTHER CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE CFSP WOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED TO THE FPAS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL </p><p>BE EVER MORE IMPORTANT IF THE CFSP FINDINGS ARE TO BE </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE 2002 CFA STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>20.  COMMENT:  WHETHER OR NOT IT MAKES SENSE TO TRAIN </p><p>THREE NGOS IN THE FEA METHODOLOGY SO THAT THEY CAN </p><p>CONDUCT A CFSP IN THEIR AORS IS DEBATABLE.  AT THIS </p><p>POINT, IT MIGHT BE MORE COST-EFFICIENT AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  05 OF 13  070644Z </p><p>EXPEDITIOUS TO BRING FAO AND UNICEF INTO THE PROCESS, </p><p>WHO WAS ALSO EARLIER LOCKED OUT, TO JOIN FORCES WITH </p><p>WFP TO CONDUCT A NATIONWIDE FOOD SECURITY SURVEY. </p><p>THIS MUST BE DISCUSSED IN THE FIELD WITH ALL RELEVANT </p><p>PARTNERS AND A CONCLUSION QUICKLY REACHED.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>FOOD SECURITY / AGRICULTURE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21 . THE 2002 CEREAL NEEDS FOR SIERRA LEONE TOTAL </p><p>550,000 MT.  CURRENT PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS FOR 2002 </p><p>ARE ESTIMATED AT 290,000 MT.  TOTAL FOOD PROGRAMMED </p><p>BY THE FPAS FOR SIERRA LEONE FOR 2002 AMOUNT TO </p><p>82,000 MT, LEAVING A CEREAL DEFICIT OF OVER 178,000 </p><p>MT. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE OVERALL FOOD SECURITY SITUATION IMPROVED </p><p>DURING 2001 AS A RESULT OF THE GOSL AND DONORS, </p><p>THROUGH THEIR IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS, PROVIDING </p><p>AGRICULTURAL INPUTS (RICE, GROUNDNUT AND VEGETABLES </p><p>SEEDS, ROOTS AND TUBERS PLANTING MATERIALS, WATERING </p><p>CANS) TO THE RELATIVELY SAFE AND STABLE COMMUNITIES. </p><p>HARVESTS OF RICE, CASSAVA, SWEET POTATO AND </p><p>VEGETABLES WERE RATED GOOD\' IN THE DISTRICTS OF BO, </p><p>KENEMA, PORT LOKO, BOMBALI AND KAMBIA.  IT SHOULD BE </p><p>NOTED THAT VERY FEW AGENCIES VENTURED INTO THE LESS </p><p>SAFE AREAS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL RECOVERY </p><p>INPUTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  06 OF 13  070644Z </p><p>23.  WFP HAS NOTED THAT THE NUMBER OF MARKET SELLERS </p><p>IN ITS AORS INCREASED AND THAT MOST OF THE LOCALLY- </p><p>PRODUCED FOOD ITEMS LIKE ROUGH AND PARBOILED RICE, </p><p>PALM OIL, CASSAVA, POTATO LEAVES AND TUBERS WERE </p><p>COMING FROM THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND CHIEFDOMS. </p><p>THE PRIMARY PERSISTING CONCERN RELATED TO FOOD </p><p>SECURITY, PARTICULARLY ALONG THE BORDER AREAS, IS THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR LARGE AND RAPID INFLUXES OF REFUGEES </p><p>AND RETURNEES FROM LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE. </p><p> </p><p>24. WFP ALSO RECENTLY LEARNED FROM ITS CFSP THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH RETURNEES ARE ABLE TO PURSUE VARIOUS </p><p>STRATEGIES FOR OBTAINING FOOD AND INCOME, A LARGE </p><p>CONCENTRATION OF RETURNEES WILL INEVITABLY STRAIN, </p><p>AND IN CERTAIN CASES, OVERWHELM LOCAL ABSORPTION </p><p>CAPACITY, HENCE CREATING COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES. </p><p>THE DIFFERENTIAL IN THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY </p><p>BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND RETURNEES IS NOT AS GREAT AS </p><p>EXPECTED.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </p><p>SAFE AND PREVIOUSLY INSECURE AREAS IS ALSO NOT AS </p><p>GREAT AS EXPECTED.  THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO A LACK OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE EVEN IN SAFE AREAS, COMBINED WITH THE </p><p>DIVERSION OF THE LABOR FORCE TO DEFENSIVE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>AS WELL AS TO ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS IN SAFE </p><p>AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>25. THE TEAM SUPPORTS AN INCREASE OF FOOD-FOR- </p><p>AGRICULTURE (FFAG) AND FOOD-FOR-TRAINING (FFT) </p><p>PROGRAM ACTIVITY, WITH THE LATTER CONCENTRATING ON </p><p>PROJECTS GEARED TO LOW-INCOME GROUPS ACQUIRING </p><p>VOCATIONAL/TECHNICAL SKILLS AND LITERACY THAT WILL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  06 OF 13  070644Z </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME FINANCIALLY </p><p>SELF-SUFFICIENT.  FAO AND WFP WERE ADVISED TO CLOSELY </p><p>COORDINATE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH ONE ANOTHER, </p><p>SOMETHING THE TEAM BELIEVES HAS BEEN LACKING.  BOTH </p><p>AGENCIES\' WORK WOULD BENEFIT FROM A STRONGER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO. </p><p> </p><p>26.  THE FPAS ALSO SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THEIR </p><p>EMERGENCY SCHOOL FEEDING (ESF) AS THIS ACTIVITY IS </p><p>FOCUSED ON GETTING SCHOOLS REOPENED IN THE ACCESSIBLE </p><p>AREAS, ENCOURAGING THE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION </p><p>OF ALL CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY GIRLS, AND ENSURING THAT, </p><p>ONCE IN SCHOOL, SHORT-TERM HUNGER DOES NOT INHIBIT </p><p>THEIR CAPACITY TO LEARN.  TO BENEFIT FROM THE ESF, </p><p>PRIMARY SCHOOLS MUST HAVE A MINIMUM RATIO OF FEMALE </p><p>TO MALE STUDENTS, BE GOVERNMENT-RECOGNIZED, HAVE A </p><p>FUNCTIONING COMMUNITY-TEACHER ASSOCIATION (CTA) AND A </p><p>HEAD-TEACHER AND AN ON-SITE TEACHING STAFF OF AT </p><p>LEAST TWO GOVERNMENT-RECOGNIZED AND/OR CERTIFIED </p><p>TEACHERS TO OVERSEE THE ESF. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p></p><p>CARE, CRS AND WORLD VISION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SEEDS </p><p>PROTECTED BY THE FOOD RATIONS WILL ALLOW A 50 PERCENT </p><p>INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE RICE ACREAGE PLANTED AND </p><p>PRODUCTION PER HOUSEHOLD. </p><p> </p><p>29.  WORLD VISION CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>IMPROVEMENT OF HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND SUSTAINED </p><p>PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY FOR 204,000 PERSONS IN 16 </p><p>CHIEFDOMS IN SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF BO, BONTHE AND </p><p>PUJEHUN DISTRICTS, AS WELL AS IN ALL 14 CHIEFDOMS IN </p><p>THE KONO DISTRICT OF EASTERN PROVINCE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>WORLD VISION DID INDICATE TO THE TEAM THAT IT IS </p><p>CONSIDERING PHASING OUT ITS EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO THE SOUTH BY REINFORCING LOCAL CAPACITY AND MOVING </p><p>FROM RELIEF TO DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>30.  ALL THREE FPAS EXPRESSED THEIR INTEREST TO MOVE </p><p>FROM A FOOD EMERGENCY PROFILE TO A FULL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>CONTEXT IN 2003.  WHILE IT IS NOTED THAT 2001 WAS A </p><p>RELATIVELY PEACEFUL YEAR FOR SIERRA LEONE AND THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  07 OF 13  070644Z </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION HAS GRADUALLY IMPROVED ALONG WITH </p><p>THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE DDR PROCESS, THE TEAM IS </p><p>CONCERNED THERE ARE MANY LINGERING FACTORS THAT COULD </p><p>EASILY UPSET THIS STABILITY.  GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE REGION AND UNCERTAINTY OF THE ELECTION </p><p>PROCESS, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT PROJECT PROPOSALS FOR </p><p>2003 MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY FOR THE ALLOCATION OF </p><p>RESOURCES ENABLING THE SWIFT SHIFTING OF SUPPLIES </p><p>GEOGRAPHICALLY, AS WELL AS BY PROGRAM, PENDING A NEW </p><p>CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>VISIT TO KAMBIA DISTRICT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  KAMBIA DISTRICT IS AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>DECLARED SAFE FOR RETURN BY THE GOSL AND IS WFP\'S </p><p>AOR.  KAMBIA SERVED AS A TEST CASE FOR THE DDR </p><p>PROGRAM AND WAS THE FIRST DISTRICT IN WHICH THE </p><p>REBELS WERE DISARMED.  THE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>KAMBIA ARE FARMING, FISHING, AND TRADING, WITH THE </p><p>LATTER BEING MAXIMIZED DUE TO KAMBIA\'S CLOSE </p><p>PROXIMITY TO THE GUINEAN BORDER. </p><p> </p><p>32.  SINCE DECEMBER 2001, WFP HAS ASSISTED IN THE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 10,500 PERSONS IN </p><p>KAMBIA BY PROVIDING THEM WITH TWO-MONTHS RESETTLEMENT </p><p>RATIONS.  WITHIN KAMBIA, WFP IS ENGAGED IN SEVERAL </p><p>FFW ACTIVITIES--MOSTLY ROAD REHABILITATION TO IMPROVE </p><p>MARKET ACCESS IN THE AREA.  THE WORK FOCUSES ON HEAVY </p><p>BRUSH REMOVAL, DRAINAGE CONSTRUCTION, OVERHEAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  08 OF 13  070645Z </p><p>CUTTING, AND FILLING POTHOLES.  ONCE A TASK IS </p><p>IDENTIFIED, WFP PROJECTS THE WORK TO TAKE A CERTAIN </p><p>NUMBER OF DAYS.  THE FOOD IS THEN PROVIDED IN </p><p>ALLOTMENTS AFTER A BENCHMARK OF WORK HAS BEEN </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED.  IF THE WORKERS ARE GOING TOO SLOWLY, </p><p>NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO THE RATION SIZE; THE TOTAL </p><p>AMOUNT OF FOOD DETERMINED FOR THE WORK REMAINS </p><p>CONSTANT. </p><p> </p><p>33.  WHILE IN KAMBIA ON FEBRUARY 5, THE MISSION ALSO </p><p>HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AN FAO INCOME GENERATION </p><p>ACTIVITY FOR WOMEN.  UNDER THIS INITIATIVE, WOMEN </p><p>ORGANIZE THEMSELVES INTO GROUPS OR COOPERATIVES AND </p><p>ARE PROVIDED WITH A SMALL GENERATOR AND GRINDER THAT </p><p>IS USED TO MILL CASSAVA.  A WAREHOUSE, FOR STORAGE </p><p>PURPOSES, IS ALSO CONSTRUCTED.  ALREADY, SURROUNDING </p><p>VILLAGES WERE COMING TO THIS VILLAGE TO UTILIZE THE </p><p>SMALL MILLING OPERATION.  THIS PROJECT IS GENERATING </p><p>QUICK INCOME FOR WOMEN, AS WELL AS PROVIDING INCOME </p><p>TO EMBARK ON TRADITIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS.  DURING THE TEAM\'S VISIT, THE COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>APPRECIATION OF THE PROJECT WAS QUITE APPARENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>VISIT TO KAILAHUN DISTRICT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  KAILAHUN AND KONO (JUST NORTH OF KAILAHUN) </p><p>DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY THE MOST FOOD INSECURE REGION </p><p>IN SIERRA LEONE.  THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE FOOD </p><p>SHORTAGE IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SECURITY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  08 OF 13  070645Z </p><p>SITUATION.  A NUMBER OF CHIEFDOMS IN KAILAHUN AND </p><p>KONO DISTRICTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DECLARED SAFE FOR </p><p>RETURN BY UNHCR.  KAILAHUN IS AN AOR OF WFP, AND AS A </p><p>RESULT OF INSECURITY IN THE DISTRICT THROUGHOUT 2001, </p><p>WFP DID NOT HAVE ACCESS UNTIL AUGUST 2001, SOON AFTER </p><p>UNAMSIL TROOPS ARRIVED.  SIERRA LEONEAN MILITARY </p><p>TROOPS HAD JUST ARRIVED THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 4 AND </p><p>WERE SETTING UP BASE CAMPS.  THE TEAM ALSO SAW LINES </p><p>OF DECOMBATANTS WAITING TO RECEIVE THEIR ONE-OFF </p><p>STIPEND OF 150 USD FOR DISARMING AND REGISTERING. </p><p> </p><p>35.  WHILE IN KAILAHUN DISTRICT ON FEBRUARY 6, THE </p><p>TEAM WAS ABLE TO VISIT AN IMPROMPTU, UNOFFICIAL </p><p>LIBERIAN REFUGEE CAMP LOCATED IN BUEDU, SEVERAL </p><p>KILOMETERS FROM THE LIBERIAN BORDER, AND WENT TO DARU </p><p>TOWN.  DUE TO SECURITY CONSTRAINTS AND THE PROXIMITY </p><p>TO THE BORDER, WFP DOES NOT PROVIDE GENERAL FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS TO LIBERIAN REFUGEES ACCOMMODATED IN </p><p>UNOFFICIAL CAMPS IN KAILAHUN, BUEDU AND KOINDU TOWNS. </p><p>WFP WORKS CLOSELY WITH UNHCR TO MOVE REFUGEES, WHO </p><p>CHOOSE TO DO SO, TO SAFER CAMPS IN KENEMA DISTRICT </p><p>WHERE THEY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE.  BEFORE A STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED IN LIBERIA ON FEBRUARY 8AS OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 6, 2002, UNHCR ESTIMATED THERE WERE SOME </p><p>2,000 LIBERIAN REFUGEES WHO DESIRED TO BE MOVED FROM </p><p>THE BORDER TO SAFER LOCATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>36.  IN BUEDU, THE TEAM HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK </p><p>WITH SEVERAL RECENT ARRIVALS, SOME COMING AS RECENTLY </p><p>AS ONE WEEK PRIOR.  THEY TOLD THE TEAM THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>HELD FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AT THE BORDER BEFORE BEING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  09 OF 13  070645Z </p><p>ALLOWED TO CROSS.  OTHERS HAD LEFT THEIR VILLAGES </p><p>SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.  THE TEAM TALKED WITH ONE YOUNG </p><p>BOY FROM FOYA WHO WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE.  HE HAD </p><p>RECENTLY LOST HIS MOTHER AND SISTER IN THE FIGHTING, </p><p>HIS FATHER HAD DIED SOME YEARS BEFORE, AND HE WAS NOW </p><p>THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY.  HE WAS WILLING TO RE-LOCATE </p><p>TO KENEMA. </p><p> </p><p>37.  IT WAS THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE GROUP THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN LIBERIA WAS DETERIORATING AND THAT MORE </p><p>PEOPLE WOULD BE CROSSING INTO SIERRA LEONE.  FEELING </p><p>EQUAL UNREST ABOUT THE SITUATION IN LIBERIA, SOME </p><p>3,000 SIERRA LEONEAN REFUGEES FROM CAMPS IN WESTERN </p><p>LIBERIA CROSSED THE BORDER BY FOOT INTO PUJEHUN </p><p>DISTRICT THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>38.  THE REFUGEES IN BUEDU WHO HAVE DECIDED AGAINST </p><p>RELOCATION SEEM TO HAVE SOME ACCESS TO LAND, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON NEARBY FARMS.  FOR </p><p>CASUAL WORK UNDERTAKEN, THE REFUGEES ARE BEING PAID </p><p>BY THE FARMERS IN-KIND WITH FOOD (I.E. RICE) OR IN </p><p>CASH (ABOUT 500 LEONES PER DAY, EQUAL TO </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 25 CENTS).  WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT HOW </p><p>MANY REFUGEES WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, ONE OF THE </p><p>RESPECTED ELDERS IN THE CAMP NOTED THERE WERE </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 6,000 TO 10,000 REFUGEES IN BUEDU, OF </p><p>WHOM 750 HAD EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN RESETTLING TO </p><p>SAFER AREAS.  THESE NUMBERS COULD NOT BE VERIFIED BY </p><p>THE TEAM, BUT IT WAS CLEAR THE LARGER PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>THE REFUGEES WERE OPTING AT THIS POINT TO REMAIN IN </p><p>BUEDU, RATHER THAN SEEK RE-LOCATION TO THE UNHCR CAMP </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  09 OF 13  070645Z </p><p>IN KENEMA, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RECEIVING NO FORMAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>39.  ALTHOUGH NOT PROVIDING FOOD THROUGH A GENERAL </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTION, WFP IS PROVIDING FOOD TO SEVERAL </p><p>SUPPLEMENTARY AND THERAPEUTIC FEEDING CENTERS: </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CORPS (IMC) IN KAILAHUN AND </p><p>BUEDA (OPENED NOVEMBER 16; ABOUT 30 NEW PATIENTS PER </p><p>DAY), ACTION CONTRE LA FAIM (ACF) IN KANGAMA AND </p><p>KOINDU, AND MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES (MSF) ALSO IN </p><p>KAILAHUN, IN ORDER TO TARGET MALNOURISHED CHILDREN. </p><p>A MIXTURE OF REFUGEES AND IDPS ARE TREATED. </p><p> </p><p>40.  THE TEAM VISITED A RAPID RESPONSE EDUCATION </p><p>PROJECT (RREP) OVERSEEN BY THE NORWEGIAN REFUGEE </p><p>COUNCIL IN DARU TOWN.  IN THE RREP, CHILDREN BETWEEN </p><p>THE AGES OF 10-15 WHO HAVE LOST YEARS OF EDUCATION </p><p>DUE TO THE WAR UNDERGO A SIX MONTHS INTRODUCTION </p><p>COURSE THAT ENABLES THEM TO BE TRAINED AND </p><p>TRANSFERRED TO FORMAL SCHOOLS.  WFP SUPPORTS THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE IN KAILAHUN DISTRICT, AS WELL AS IN OTHER </p><p>DISTRICTS OF SIERRA LEONE, BY PROVIDING FOOD TO THE </p><p>SCHOOL FOR HOT MEALS DURING CLASS TIME.  THE RREP IN </p><p>DARU HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERRED 5,975 CHILDREN </p><p>(2,872 GIRLS) TO FORMAL SCHOOLS SINCE IT BEGAN IN MAY </p><p>2000.  WFP\'S SUPPORT OF THE RREP IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>LOGISTICS </p><p>---------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  10 OF 13  070645Z </p><p> </p><p>41.  ALL THE FPA FOOD COMMODITIES THAT ENTER SIERRA </p><p>LEONE ARRIVE AT THE PORT OF FREETOWN.  WFP RECENTLY </p><p>SPENT 600,000 USD TO REHABILITATE ONE OF THE MAIN </p><p>PORT STORAGE SHEDS AND IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PORT </p><p>AUTHORITY WFP WILL NOW HAVE USE OF THIS SHED FOR A </p><p>PERIOD OF TEN YEARS AT AN ANNUAL RENT OF ONE US </p><p>DOLLAR.  IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE PORT FACILITIES </p><p>REMAIN POOR, AS DOES SECURITY.  THE PORT AUTHORITY </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROCURE THE EQUIPMENT </p><p>NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SERVICES TO PORT USERS. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, FREETOWN PORT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>EXPENSIVE PORTS IN WEST AFRICA LARGELY DUE TO ITS </p><p>INEFFICIENCIES.  IMPROVEMENTS OF THE PORT FACILITIES </p><p>ARE MUCH NEEDED. UNDER A SPECIAL OPERATION (SO), WFP </p><p>IS TO PROVIDE THE PORT WITH MUCH NEEDED EQUIPMENT, </p><p>SUCH AS DIESEL FORKLIFTS, TERMINAL TRACTORS AND A 40- </p><p>FOOT SPREADER UNIT TO FACILITATE THE </p><p>OFFLOADING/LOADING OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO.  THE SO </p><p>REMAINS UNDER FUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>42.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DURING MOST OF 2001, THE </p><p>FPAS CONTINUOUSLY FACED SECURITY PROBLEMS IN THE PORT </p><p>DUE TO PILFERAGE OF AND WILLFUL DAMAGES TO </p><p>COMMODITIES BY PORT STAFF.  ALTHOUGH MUCH EFFORT BY </p><p>THE FPAS WAS EXTENDED TO ENSURE THAT PORT MANAGEMENT </p><p>BETTER CONTROL THE WORKING AREAS SO THAT ONLY </p><p>AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT WHEN A VESSEL IS </p><p>UNLOADING, THE EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCED LITTLE FRUIT, AS </p><p>PILFERAGE CONTINUES TO SOME EXTENT. THE INSTIGATORS </p><p>ARE OFTEN PORT WORKERS OR THEIR ACCOMPLICES.  UP TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  10 OF 13  070645Z </p><p>TWO TO THREE PERCENT OF LOSSES HAVE BEEN NOTED FOR </p><p>SOME SHIPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>43. THE LONG HAUL COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT MARKET IN </p><p>SIERRA LEONE IS APPARENTLY STRONG AND COMPETITIVE. </p><p>ALL THE FPAS UTILIZE COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTERS FOR THE </p><p>DELIVERY OF FOOD COMMODITIES FROM FREETOWN TO </p><p>EXTENDED DELIVERY POINTS.  IN THE RAINY SEASON, </p><p>HOWEVER, SMALL FEEDER ROADS BECOME VERY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>PLY WITH TRUCKS WEIGHING TEN MT OR MORE.  SOME OF THE </p><p>FPAS WFP RELYIES UPON THEIR ITS OWN FLEETS NAMELY </p><p>WFP) TO MOVE FOOD COMMODITIES TO MORE REMOTE </p><p>LOCATIONS.  HOWEVER, IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASE </p><p>OF COMMERCIAL HAULERS, THE FPAS SHOULD ENSURE THAT </p><p>DEDICATED TRUCKS ONLY BE USED ONLY WHEN CRITICALLY </p><p>NECESSARY, SO AS NOT TO COMPETE AGAINST THE LOCAL </p><p>TRANSPORT SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>4431.  WFP MAINTAINS A HELICOPTER OPERATION THAT </p><p>PERFORMS A MULTITUDE OF VITAL FUNCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE EFFECTIVE PLANNING AND RUNNING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS </p><p>OF THE HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS.  HOWEVER, WFP </p><p>RECOGNIZING THAT THE SITUATION INS SIERRA LEONE IS </p><p>EVOLVING, AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS AND </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS ARE STILL REMAIN VALID TO FOR THE </p><p>SUPPORT A HELICOPTER OPERATION, WFP WILL UNDERTAKE A </p><p>REVIEW WITH DONOR AND HUMANITARIAN PARTNERS WILL BE </p><p>UNDERTAKEN AT MID YEAR.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE </p><p>HELICOPTER OPERATION ALSO REMAINS UNDER- FUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  11 OF 13  070646Z </p><p>PIPELINE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>45.  FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY--DECEMBER 2002, WFP/SL IS </p><p>TARGETING 507,000 BENEFICIARIES WITH 53,081 MT OF </p><p>ASSORTED FOOD COMMODITIES.  AS OF 6 FEBRUARY, WFP/SL </p><p>HAD CONFIRMED CONTRIBUTIONS OF 8,710 MT LEAVING A </p><p>BALANCE OF 44,371 MT STILL TO BE RESOURCED.  IN </p><p>FISCAL YEAR 2002 (FY02), USAID/DCHA/FFP HAS </p><p>CONTRIBUTED 7,200 MT (VALUED AT 4.8 MILLION USD) OF </p><p>TITLE II EMERGENCY COMMODITIES, OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN </p><p>13 PERCENT OF WFP\'S PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY </p><p>OPERATION (PRRO) REQUIREMENTS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE MAJORITY OF RETURNEES\' HOMES ARE LOCATED IN </p><p>WFP AORS. </p><p> </p><p>46.

EVEN THOUGH THE FOUR FPAS </p><p>BORROW FROM EACH OTHER WHEN NECESSARY, THE FACT THAT </p><p>THE THREE NGO FPAS RECEIVE ALL THEIR COMMODITIES FROM </p><p>THE U. S. ALLOWS THEM TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY PIPELINES, </p><p>WHEREAS THE U.S. COVERS ONLY A PORTION OF WFP\'S </p><p>PIPELINE NEEDS.  THE CURRENT DELAY OF WFP COMMODITIES </p><p>COUPLED WITH WFP\'S ONGOING PIPELINE PROBLEMS CAST A </p><p>SHADOW OF DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE WFP ANTICIPATED </p><p>ARRIVALS IN MARCH WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD RESETTLEMENT PACKAGES, WHICH </p><p>CONTAIN A TWO-MONTH RATION.  THE CURRENT ESTIMATED </p><p>MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL FPAS COULD INCREASE IF </p><p>THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS SUDDENLY ACCELERATES. </p><p> </p><p>48.  UNLESS FURTHER RESOURCES ARE COMMITTED, WFP WILL </p><p>EXPERIENCE ACROSS-THE-BOARD BREAKS IN ITS PIPELINE IN </p><p>JULY.  WFP IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO COVER SHORTFALLS </p><p>WITH BORROWINGS, EITHER FROM WFP\'S REGIONAL PRRO OR </p><p>LOCALLY FROM THE OTHER FPAS.  BECAUSE OF THESE </p><p>PIPELINE PROBLEMS, WFP HAS BEEN FORCED TO EITHER </p><p>MODIFY RATION SCALES OR PROVIDE UNBALANCED FOOD </p><p>BASKETS OR BOTH.  SHOULD WFP CONTINUE TO FACE GAPS IN </p><p>ITS PIPELINE AND AT THE SAME TIME RECEIVE NO </p><p>ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS, THE OTHER FPAS MAY NO </p><p>LONGER BE IN A POSITION TO LOAN WFP THE NECESSARY </p><p>COMMODITIES TO COVER SHORTFALLS.  RATHER, THESE FPAS </p><p>MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OVER OPERATIONAL </p><p> </p><p>49.  IT IS EXPECTED THAT TITLE II EMERGENCY </p><p>COMMODITIES PROVIDED IN 2003 WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  12 OF 13  070646Z </p><p>LESS THAN THAT PROVIDED IN 2002.  SERIOUS </p><p>DELIBERATION AND ANALYSIS MUST BE INVESTED TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>MAINTAINING FOUR PIPELINES MAKES SENSE </p><p>PROGRAMMATICALLY AS WELL AS FINANCIALLY.  THEREFORE, </p><p>TO PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED, EFFICIENT AND COST </p><p>EFFECTIVE APPROACH THE NUMBER OF FPAS WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>REDUCED IN 2003 THROUGH A CAREFUL ANALYZATION </p><p>APPROACH.  AT THE VERY LEAST, A COST-SAVING MEASURE </p><p>WOULD BE TO STREAMLINE THE LOGISTICS OPERATION UNDER </p><p>ONE FPA BECAUSE TONNAGES WOULD PRESUMABLY BE </p><p>DECREASING IN 2003.  IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT ONE FPA </p><p>COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL LOGISTICS STORAGE </p><p>OPERATIONS IN FREETOWN. THIS OPTION IS NOW BEING </p><p>EXPLORED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5033.  DUE TO THE VOLATILE SITUATION IN LIBERIA,  AND </p><p>THE POTENTIAL MASS MOVEMENT INFLUX OF LIBERIAN </p><p>REFUGEES, AND POSSIBLE ACCELERATED RETURN OF SIERRA </p><p>LEONEAN REFUGEES, THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR FURTHER </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING.  AND PREPAREDNESS AS THE </p><p>CURRENT CRISIS IN LIBERIA DEEPENS AND POPULATION </p><p>DISPLACEMENT INCREASES.  MOREOVER, IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTION PROCESS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>DETERIORATION IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, IT IS </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT CONTINGENCY PLANNING MEASURES BE </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IMMEDIATELY BY THE UN COUNTRY TEAM TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  12 OF 13  070646Z </p><p>ENSURE READINESS FOR POTENTIAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS </p><p>AND AN ABILITY TO COPE WITH A DECLINING SITUATION </p><p>WITHIN SIERRA LEONE.

THE TEAM MAKES THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-  REGARDING WFP SPECIFIC OPERATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>WFP SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FFW AND FFAG </p><p>PROJECTS, FOCUSED ESPECIALLY ON THE REINTEGRATION </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>WFP SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EMERGENCY </p><p>SCHOOL FEEDING PROJECT, IF WFP\'S PIPELINE ALLOWS, </p><p>ONCE LIFE-SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES ARE FULFILLED. </p><p> </p><p>WFP SHOULD ENSURE THAT POST-DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MONITORING TAKES PLACE IN THE INTERIM CAMPS, AS WELL </p><p>AS IN ALL REFUGEE AND IDP CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE CFA NEEDS TO DEVELOP A CLEAR POLICY ABOUT ONE </p><p>FPA WORKING IN ANOTHER\'S AREA.  THE CURRENT POLICY, </p><p>REQUIRES APPROVAL FROM THE FPA IN CHARGE OF THE AOR, </p><p>BUT WITH A GROWING NUMBER OF REQUESTS, THIS SYSTEM IS </p><p>NOW BECOMING TOO COMPLICATED. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01182  13 OF 13  070646Z </p><p> </p><p>-  WFP AND FAO/TCOR NEED TO WORK MORE CLOSELY </p><p>TOGETHER IN THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE FPAS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH FAO AND UNICEF, </p><p>NEED TO AGREE ON A PLAN OF ACTION ABOUT HOW TO SURVEY </p><p>THE COUNTRY TO DETERMINE FOOD SECURITY NEEDS.  THE </p><p>CFSP IS ONE ALTERNATIVE, IF IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN </p><p>A SYSTEMATIC WAY THROUGHOUT ALL AORS.  SUPPOSITIONS </p><p>ABOUT FOOD SECURITY NEED TO BE CROSS-CHECKED WITH </p><p>REALITY. </p><p> </p><p>-  IF WFP\'S REVIEW OF THE HELICOPTER OPERATION </p><p>DETERMINES THERE IS A CONTINUED NEED FOR THE SERVICE, </p><p>IT IS SUGGESTED THAT USAID/OFDA CONSIDER ADDITIONAL </p><p>FUNDING. </p><p> </p><p>-  WFP/SL\'S PIPELINE IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE.  WITH </p><p>CURRENT COMMITMENTS, WFP WILL EXPERIENCE A COMPLETE </p><p>BREAK IN THE PIPELINE IN JULY.  A DEMARCHE TO KEY </p><p>DONORS HIGHLIGHTING THE ANTICIPATED BREAK MIGHT BE </p><p>HELPFUL AT THIS JUNCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-  SERIOUS DELIBERATION AND ANALYSIS MUST BE INVESTED </p><p>TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>MAINTAINING FOUR PIPELINES IN 2003 MAKES SENSE </p><p>PROGRAMMATICALLY, AS WELL AS FINANCIALLY.  AT THE </p><p>VERY LEAST, A COST-SAVING MEASURE WOULD BE TO </p><p>STREAMLINE THE LOGISTICS OPERATION UNDER ONE FPA </p><p>BECAUSE TONNAGES WOULD PRESUMABLY BE DECREASING IN </p><p>2003.  ALL OPTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY USAID/FFP. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01182  13 OF 13  070646Z </p><p> </p><p>-  WITHIN THE PORT, THERE IS LIMITED CONTAINER </p><p>HANDLING EQUIPMENT AND A LACK OF STEVEDORE GEAR TO </p><p>HANDLE PALLETIZED CARGO.  WHILST WFP IS ALREADY </p><p>PROVIDING SOME MUCH NEEDED COMMODITY HANDLING </p><p>EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL CARGO HANDLING </p><p>SITUATION, THE LACK OF DONOR FUNDING TO WFP\'S SO FOR </p><p>THE PORT REHABILITATION HAS RESULTED IN AN OVERALL </p><p>REDUCTION IN THE PORT\'S ALREADY COMPROMISED LEVEL OF </p><p>EFFICIENCY, WITH FURTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COSTS </p><p>OF FOOD AID, OTHER AID AND COMMERCIAL IMPORTERS. </p><p>ALONG WITH THE PORT REHABILITATION AUTHORITY, WFP HAS </p><p>IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF PRIORITY REQUIRED MEASURES AND </p><p>THESE SHOULD BE SUPPORTED TO INCREASE THE OVERALL </p><p>OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF FREETOWN PORT.
