<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001988 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL KING NAMES NEW PM, MEMBERS OF CABINET </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1955 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On October 11 King Gyanendra appointed National </p><p>Democratic Party Leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand as Prime </p><p>Minister.  Chand, who has been PM three times before, will </p><p>head a caretaker government until national elections can be </p><p>held on an unspecified date.  Biographic information on Chand </p><p>follows in Paras 5-7 below.  The King also made a number of </p><p>appointments to Chand\'s Cabinet that include some figures </p><p>from the autocratic Panchayat era.  Other appointments </p><p>reflect an apparent effort to broaden inclusion of various </p><p>groups in the caretaker government.  The choice of Chand as </p><p>interim PM appears to meet the political parties\' requirement </p><p>that the Prime Minister be a political figure while </p><p>reflecting the conservative political preference of the </p><p>Palace.  The members of the New Cabinet seem to meet the </p><p>King\'s "clean image" criterion (Reftel).  The Nepali Congress </p><p>and the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML), the two largest parties in the country, tell us that, </p><p>contrary to their expectations, they had no input into the </p><p>King\'s announcement of the Cabinet.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CHAND AS PM AGAIN </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On October 11--the day before the onset of the </p><p>weeklong Dasain holiday--King Gyanendra appointed National </p><p>Democratic Party Leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand as Prime </p><p>Minister.  Chand, who has been PM three times before (twice </p><p>under the former autocratic Panchayat regime and once for a </p><p>seven-month stint after the restoration of democracy), will </p><p>head an interim government named by the King.  That </p><p>government will remain in place until national elections, </p><p>indefinitely postponed because of adverse security </p><p>conditions, can be held.  Clause 38 of the Constitution bars </p><p>Chand (and nearly all other members of the newly-named </p><p>Cabinet) from occupying their posts for more than six months </p><p>because they were not members of the previous Parliament.  In </p><p>addition to holding the post of PM, Chand will also hold the </p><p>Royal Palace, Defense, Forest and Soil Conservation, and </p><p>General Administration portfolios.  Chand may have selected </p><p>in part to satisfy other party leaders\' demand that the new </p><p>PM be a political person (Reftel).  The conservative National </p><p>Democratic Party (known in Nepal by the acronym RPP) is </p><p>considered close to the Palace.  Many former figures </p><p>associated with the partyless, pre-democracy Panchayat regime </p><p>are now members of the RPP. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CABINET MEMBERS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In the same announcement, the King named Badri Prasad </p><p>Mandal, Acting President of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, which </p><p>is based in the Hindi- and Bihari-speaking communities of the </p><p>lowland Terai area of southern Nepal, as Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister.  Mandal will also hold the Agriculture and </p><p>Cooperatives and the Local Development portfolios.  (Note: </p><p>Mandal is the only member of the new Cabinet who held a seat </p><p>in the recently dismissed Parliament.  End note.)  Narendra </p><p>Bikram Shah, a former Foreign Secretary (1986-1992) and UN </p><p>Perm Rep (1995-1999), has been given the Foreign Affairs </p><p>portfolio, while Dr. Badri Prasad Shrestha, a former Vice </p><p>Chairman of the National Planning Commission during the </p><p>Panchayat era, has been named Minister of Finance and </p><p>Minister of Education and Sports.  Other Cabinet posts have </p><p>been awarded to Gore Bahadur Kapangi (Women, Children, and </p><p>Social Welfare), a member of the minority Magar community; </p><p>Dharma Bahadur Thapa (Home, Justice, Law and Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs), another Panchayat-era figure with a hard-liner </p><p>reputation and a reputed close friend of the King; Dr. </p><p>Upendra Devkota (Health, Science and Technology), a </p><p>neurosurgeon with left-wing but otherwise nonpartisan </p><p>leanings; Gopal Dahit, Assistant Minister for Population and </p><p>Environment; and Anuradha Koirala, head of the </p><p>internationally respected anti-trafficking NGO Maiti Nepal </p><p>(Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare). </p><p>(Note:  The King had originally suggested a 15-person </p><p>Cabinet.  Thus other names may be forthcoming.  End note.) </p><p>One media source commented that all new Cabinet members seem </p><p>to fulfill the required "clean image" stipulated by the King </p><p>as a criterion for participation in the interim government </p><p>(Reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In his radio address naming the new Cabinet, King </p><p>Gyanendra charged the interim government with certain </p><p>specific responsibilities, including creating a national </p><p>consensus to improve security in the country.  He instructed </p><p>them to uphold multiparty democracy by holding free and fair </p><p>local and national elections.  The new Cabinet was also </p><p>directed to to control corruption; to strengthen financial </p><p>discipline and transparency; and to promote friendly </p><p>relations with neighboring countries and allies. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BIO OF LOKENDRA BAHADUR CHAND </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Lokendra Bahadur Chand had previously been Prime </p><p>Minister of Nepal on three separate occasions, including two </p><p>tours as Prime Minister under the former Panchayat regime. </p><p>He was the last Prime Minister under the Panchayat regime, </p><p>resigning in April 1990 after only a few days in office, when </p><p>the popular revolution against royal rule reached a </p><p>crescendo.  Although once reviled as a royalist pupppet, </p><p>Chand is now seen as an affable politician, who writes well </p><p>and conducts himself with the decorum appropriate to an elder </p><p>statesman.  The press is generally deferential to him, </p><p>occasionally referring to him as "Mr. Clean." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Chand served his third term as Prime Minister from </p><p>March 1997 to October 1997.  While the head of an unlikely </p><p>coalition of former revolutionaries and former royalists, he </p><p>nevertheless was able to produce some results, including new </p><p>agreements with India on air transport and land transit, a </p><p>renewed invitation to Enron to develop the Karnali-Chisapani </p><p>hydropower project, and basically free and fair local </p><p>elections.  Still, his reputation as a leader is not strong. </p><p>He is still seen by many as a man who can be manipulated by </p><p>others.   He was born in Baitadi,  a remote western region </p><p>bordering India, on March 15, 1939.  He studied in India, </p><p>graduating in arts from Nainital College and later in law </p><p>from Dehradun, and took an early interest in politics where </p><p>he rapidly made his mark as a local politician.  Elevated to </p><p>the national Panchayat in 1974, he became Vice Chairman in </p><p>1975 and Chairman in 1980. He was reelected Chairman of the </p><p>national Panchayat the following year, and, in 1983, was </p><p>elected Prime Minister of Nepal.  He also handled the </p><p>portfolios of defense and royal affairs, and reportedly </p><p>enjoyed an excellent rapport with the late King Birendra.  He </p><p>resigned in 1985 when internal power struggles undermined the </p><p>national Panchayat. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Chand received his second chance at power when, in </p><p>1990, the popular movement for restoration of multi-party </p><p>democracy came to a head in Nepal in the waning days of the </p><p>Panchayat regime.  In April 1990 he was appointed Prime </p><p>Minister to mediate with the Nepali Congress and communist </p><p>leaders of the movement.  However, the movement had already </p><p>passed the point where mediation was possible.  It culminated </p><p>with the restoration of a popularly elected parliament with </p><p>multiple parties, and the end of Chand,s second brief spell </p><p>in power.  Chand ran for Parliament again in 1999, but failed </p><p>to gain either seat in the Baitadi district.  He is married </p><p>to Subhadra Chand and has six children.  Chand has always </p><p>been accessible to US officials. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES LEFT OUT IN THE COLD </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Arjun Narasingh K.C., spokesman for the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party, and former Nepali Congress MP and Finance </p><p>Minister Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat both told us their party had </p><p>been surprised by the King\'s announcement.  Mahat said the </p><p>technocrat members of the Cabinet were good--but not the best </p><p>that could be found.  Jhala Nath Khanal of the Opposition UML </p><p>party told us that the King\'s 3:00 p.m. radio address was </p><p>"180 degrees opposite" to what he had promised UML Leader </p><p>Madhav Nepal in a private meeting just four hours earlier. </p><p>In that meeting, Nepal had agreed to Chand as the "consensus </p><p>candidate" for PM (the Nepali Congress leader had reportedly </p><p>done so as well).  The King promised the new PM would then </p><p>consult with the other parties on the composition of the rest </p><p>of his Cabinet.  The UML was thus "shocked and surprised" </p><p>that the King announced, along with the appointment of Chand, </p><p>the apparently unilateral appointment of more than half of </p><p>the Cabinet.  When asked if the UML would nominate members </p><p>for the remaining portfolios, Khanal said it was unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Leaders of other large political parties (like the </p><p>Nepali Congress and UML) had expressed concern over the past </p><p>few days that the King, despite seeking their indiviual </p><p>counsel, would ultimately make his own choices for Prime </p><p>Minister and the interim Cabinet.  The King did not accede to </p><p>the parties\' request that he meet them as a group to discuss </p><p>Cabinet appointments (Reftel), and the parties never </p><p>forwarded their suggestions for such appointments to him. </p><p>The party leaders\' dithering over the past week forced the </p><p>King to stretch his original October 9 deadline for </p><p>nominations by two days.  With the week-long Dasain holiday </p><p>looming, the monarch doubtless felt that he had to appoint a </p><p>government--with or without the parties\' consent. </p><p>Nonetheless, it is difficult to understand the King\'s </p><p>apparent about-face with party leaders whose trust he will </p><p>need to make this work.  Chand has been one of several names </p><p>floated as a possible PM over the past week.  With his "Mr. </p><p>Clean" image and his position in the third-largest party, the </p><p>Palace may be gambling that the former Panchayat-era PM was a </p><p>good compromise, if not the "consensus" candidate the other </p><p>large political parties have been demanding (Reftel). The </p><p>King has chosen a roster of past politicians and bureaucrats </p><p>who are unlikely to challenge his authority. But the heavy </p><p>representation of figures from the autocratic, pre-democracy </p><p>Panchayat regime is unlikely to sit well with the other </p><p>parties, who tag figures from that era, justly or unjustly, </p><p>as anti-democratic.  As of COB October 11, there had been no </p><p>public reaction from either the Nepali Congress or the UML </p><p>regarding the King\'s announcement.  When they do speak </p><p>up--and we assume it will be soon--their comments are likely </p><p>to be critical. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
