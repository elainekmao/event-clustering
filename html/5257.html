The Syrian head of state, Bashar </p><p>Assad, has decided to join the Istanbul meetings after </p><p>receiving assurances from Prime Minister Gul that a second </p><p>summit would be held in Damascus next week, papers report. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that the U.S., failing to secure full </p><p>Turkish support for military action against Iraq, has </p><p>decided to plan the most intense portion of the operation </p><p>from the South of Iraq, and use the Northern front as a </p><p>support and logistics center.  Turkish officials have </p><p>notified the U.S. of plans for setting up a buffer zone 12 </p><p>km from the border into Northern Iraq, Milliyet adds. </p><p>Turkey aims to control the PKK, prevent attempts to </p><p>establish a Kurdish state, and halt a possible wave of </p><p>refugees.  Milliyet also claims that Ankara has given the </p><p>nod to deployment of 15,000 special U.S. troops in Turkey. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" claims that Gen. Myers told TGS Chief Gen. </p><p>Ozkok that late February would be the most suitable time for </p><p>an operation against Iraq.  Myers said that the U.S., afraid </p><p>of inciting Muslims\' sensitivities, preferred to strike Iraq </p><p>after the Muslim Sacrifice Holiday.  Turkey and the U.S. are </p><p>working on the details of a Northern front plan, according </p><p>to Cumhuriyet.  Meanwhile, papers report that U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara Robert Pearson will brief the </p><p>parliamentary foreign relations, human rights, budget, and </p><p>defense committees at the Parliament on January 27. </p><p>U.S. officials, PKK meeting allegations: The U.S. Embassy in </p><p>Ankara has denied a January 21 report by "Milliyet" claiming </p><p>that U.S. officials have held several meetings with </p><p>PKK/KADEK representatives.  Wednesday\'s papers report that </p><p>Ankara asked Gen. Myers about the allegations, stressing </p><p>that such activities are against the spirit of the global </p><p>fight against terrorism.  The U.S. Embassy statement </p><p>underlined the fact that the PKK and KADEK are in the U.S. </p><p>list of terrorist organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Greek Cypriot leader Clerides hosted a group of </p><p>"Hurriyet" columnists in Nicosia, Cyprus.  Hurriyet reports </p><p>that Clerides said he wanted to continue peace talks with </p><p>Denktas, for he believes that with a new negotiator, the </p><p>bargaining will never end.  Clerides described as `positive\' </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan\'s call for a solution in Cyprus. </p><p>`Erdogan says that the policies followed thus far are wrong. </p><p>However, we need to know about his notion of policies to be </p><p>followed in the future,\' Clerides stressed.  On the other </p><p>hand, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister Cassoulides is quoted </p><p>by the foreign press as saying that Denktas and the Turkish </p><p>military presence on the island are the main hurdles to </p><p>Cyprus\' accession to the EU as a unified island. </p><p>Cassoulides finds Denktas to be obsessed with the past, </p><p>saying an agreement is unlikely under his leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan acquitted of irregularity: AKP leader Erdogan was </p><p>acquitted on Tuesday of allegations of illegal acquisition </p><p>of property and wealth, papers report.  The court case </p><p>concerned an alleged TL256 billion increase in Erdogan\'s </p><p>wealth between 1998-2001.  On Wednesday, the Constitutional </p><p>Court will decide whether to restrict Erdogan\'s authority as </p><p>AKP chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Iraq situation" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(1/22): "Saddam is aware of the fact that he has absolutely </p><p>no chance to withstand an American attack.  Instead, he will </p><p>most likely resist US and UK troops until Iraq is demolished </p><p>and thousands die.  In this way, he will be the `winner\' in </p><p>terms of inciting hatred against the Americans and British </p><p>among the people of Iraq. . On the other hand, the US </p><p>apparently has various game plans for Iraq and the choice </p><p>among them will be shaped according to conditions.  Yet </p><p>whatever the scenario might be, it is going to be a major </p><p>source of concern in the region.  The countries in the </p><p>region are already very disturbed about the massive military </p><p>build-up. . Ankara finds itself rather puzzled and in a very </p><p>difficult position.  Turkey is trying to support its </p><p>strategic allies while at the same time tempering their war- </p><p>mongering acts." </p><p>"US tactics" </p><p>Nazli Ilicak argued in conservative Tercuman (1/22): "What </p><p>is the US plan for Iraq exactly?  Will Saudi Arabia be next </p><p>on the list?  It should be if the US is sincere enough about </p><p>its Iraq arguments.  Unless the real intention is to control </p><p>oil fields, the US should take Saudi Arabia onto the list in </p><p>order to prevent the financing of terrorism.  Let\'s not </p><p>ignore the fact that terrorists are predominantly of Saudi </p><p>origin.  Those who live in Saudi Arabia are full of hatred </p><p>against the Saudi authoritarian regime as well as the US, </p><p>which supports it.  In other words, injustice in the Islamic </p><p>world has become the main motive for terrorism.  The US </p><p>should be as determined as it is for the Iraqi regime by </p><p>making the case against the Saudis as well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
