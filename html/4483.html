(C) JOINED BY AMBASSADORS HALL AND NICHOLSON I HAD DINNER </p><p>NOVEMBER 12 WITH PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, HIS PRINCIPAL </p><p>ADVISOR GIANNI LETTA, AND SEVERAL OTHERS. WE USED THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS UPON THE PM THE NEGATIVE EFFECT EU </p><p>POLICY WAS HAVING ON THE WILLINGNESS OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTE BIOTECH FOOD TO THEIR STARVING POPULATIONS AND THE </p><p>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE ACTIONS.  BERLUSCONI AGREED THAT </p><p>ITALY NEEDED TO HAVE A SCIENCE-BASED POLICY, AND SAID HE </p><p>WOULD HELP US WHERE HE COULD WITHIN EU COUNCILS.  I TOLD </p><p>BERLUSCONI PRIVATELY ONCE AGAIN THAT HIS AG MINISTER </p><p>CONTINUED TO DRIVE A BIOTECH POLICY BASED MORE ON EMOTION </p><p>THAN REASON, AND THAT HE AS PM NEEDED TO GET MORE INVOLVED </p><p>PERSONALLY IF HE WANTED TO COUNTER THAT TREND.  HE TOOK THE </p><p>POINT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BERLUSCONI APPEARED SURPRISED AND CONCERNED WHEN I </p><p>TOLD HIM THAT A WTO CASE WAS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY IF NO </p><p>SOLUTION TO EUROPEAN INTRANSIGENCE WAS FOUND SOON.  HE </p><p>CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UPCOMING ITALIAN </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY, AND ASKED TO BE KEPT INFORMED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GETTING THE PM\'S ATTENTION ON BIOTECH AGAIN IS </p><p>IMPORTANT.  WE NEED TO KEEP HIM ENGAGED, AND ONE WAY TO DO </p><p>THIS IS TO LET HIM KNOW DIRECTLY OUR CONCERNS AS WE MOVE </p><p>TOWARD DECISIONS ABOUT A WTO CASE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY.  IN THE NEXT WEEK, THIS EMBASSY, EMBASSY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05697  251038Z </p><p>VATICAN AND FODAG WILL PRESENT BY CABLE, OUR UPDATED AND </p><p>COORDINATED TRI-MISSION PLAN TO ADVANCE USG INTENTS ON </p><p>BIOTECH.  THE PLAN WILL IDENTIFY RESOURCES TO UNDERPIN OUR </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REACTIONS, GUIDANCE, AND </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05697 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
