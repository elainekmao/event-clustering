<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NP/KATHY CROUCH </p><p>ENERGY FOR SLD </p><p>USCS/INA FOR DHARRELL </p><p>ROME FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, KSTC, PARM, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKS REJECT AGREEMENT ARTICLES: NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2374 </p><p>     B. STATE 29502 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U)  Classified by Political-Military Counselor Stuart </p><p>Brown.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Polmiloff on April 25 spoke with MFA/Disarmament </p><p>Second Secretary Aykut Kumbaroglu to inquire if there had </p><p>been any further movement on Turkey\'s objection to three </p><p>articles of our proposed Export Control and Related Border </p><p>Security Assistance (EXBS) Program agreement (ref a). </p><p>Kumbaroglu informed us that Turkey\'s position was firm in </p><p>that the articles are not in conformity with Turkish </p><p>legislation. Polmiloff then asked if the GOT could suggest </p><p>acceptable alternative language. He replied that such an </p><p>exercise was futile as the entirety of the three articles </p><p>were problematic and could not be fixed by wordsmithing the </p><p>language.  He then went on to say the MFA assumed the </p><p>Agreement was a "template" one presented by the USG to </p><p>several governments with no negotiating process or </p><p>country-specific considerations.  Thus, no regard had been </p><p>given to Turkey\'s specific legislative obstacles.  He </p><p>proposed once again that Turkey and the US continue to </p><p>cooperate with "purpose-oriented projects" without an </p><p>extensive, overarching agreement.  Polmiloff informed </p><p>Kumbaroglu that the Department\'s position is that further </p><p>equipment installation and other EXBS program projects cannot </p><p>go forward absent the GOT\'s signing the proposed agreement. </p><p>Polmiloff asked Kumbaroglu to convey this information to his </p><p>Department Head. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Action Request:  Post requests the Department\'s </p><p>guidance on next steps.  It would seem that we need either </p><p>bilateral negotiations with the GOT to overcome Turkey\'s </p><p>specific legislative obstacles or we need to consider the GOT </p><p>recommendation to proceed on a project-by-project basis, </p><p>short of an overarching EXBS agreement.  Please advise. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
