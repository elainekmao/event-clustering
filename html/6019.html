<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0054 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>FEBURARY 24, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 24, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Hurriyet: The European Committee for </p><p>Prevention of Torture (CPT) who last week visited </p><p>PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali prison </p><p>by helicopter provided by the Justice Ministry </p><p>determined that Ocalan was physically sound. The </p><p>two-person CPT delegation met with Ocalan for </p><p>five hours.  They determined that his sole </p><p>complaint was isolation. The following points </p><p>were underlined in the CPT report: Ocalan is in </p><p>good health. The Turkish authorities provide </p><p>regular physical examinations and report the </p><p>results to Ankara. Ocalan\'s family and lawyers </p><p>were being taken to the island every Wednesday by </p><p>the Justice Ministry\'s official boat. However, </p><p>when the winds are too high (Level 4), such boat </p><p>journeys are not doable. No one has able to visit </p><p>Ocalan for a long time - since the end of </p><p>November. Thus, there has been an obstacle to </p><p>such boat visits.  The CPT team is of the </p><p>impression that this obstacle is being created </p><p>deliberately. Ocalan has access to daily </p><p>newspapers. He has a transistor radio on which he </p><p>can listen to TRT (Turkish Radio and Television). </p><p>The CPT believes that, even with limitations or </p><p>conditions, a means of telephone communication </p><p>should be created for Ocalan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Hurriyet: It is reported that the wave of </p><p>migration Turkey expects in the likely war on </p><p>Iraq already started in Northern Iraq\'s region </p><p>close to Hakkari province. It is gathered that </p><p>the migration movement that started in Barzani\'s </p><p>KDP controlled region has not reached Turkey yet, </p><p>and the immigrants are living on their own means, </p><p>and that Kizilay, the Turkish Red Crescent, has </p><p>undertaken all sorts of precautions to provide </p><p>relief to the immigrants in the event they </p><p>appeared at the Turkish border. Although </p><p>Barzani\'s KDP and Talabani\'s PUK claim that there </p><p>won\'t be a migration like the one in 1991, </p><p>Turkish officials believe migration will be </p><p>inevitable. Turkey has had a military presence in </p><p>northern Iraq since 1993, and is worried that the </p><p>United States is depending on Mesud Barzani\'s </p><p>forces too much. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Hurriyet/Radikal:  IKDP\'s spokesman, Hosyar </p><p>Zebari threatened Ankara by warning that the </p><p>Turkish army should not enter the region, and </p><p>they would clash with them if they did. Zebari </p><p>was quoted as saying, "We understand Turkey\'s </p><p>sensitivity, and we guaranteed it repeatedly. Our </p><p>purpose is not to found an independent Kurdistan. </p><p>We have showed in the past that we could work in </p><p>coordination with Turks. Even a minor </p><p>intervention will cause clashes. Any intervention </p><p>on any pretext will cause clashes. No one should </p><p>think that we are bluffing." Zebari said that </p><p>there was nothing that required the Turkish army </p><p>to enter the region, and that they could take </p><p>care of anything needed in the region. He said </p><p>there was no discrimination against Turcomans, </p><p>and that they were their co-citizens and </p><p>partners. Talabani\'s spokesman, Latif Resit, also </p><p>expressed that they were against Turkish army </p><p>penetration into the region, and in response to </p><p>whether or not they would enter Kirkuk, Mr. Resit </p><p>said "our forces will remain as part of Iraq\'s </p><p>forces." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet/Turkiye: Turkish armed forces\' </p><p>military build-up in the region continues. </p><p>Military convoys carrying ammunition and military </p><p>equipment from various towns are first destined </p><p>for Cizre and Silopi townships. Three convoys -- </p><p>consisting in total of 25 trucks, 15 jeeps and 20 </p><p>TIR trucks carrying armored vehicles and </p><p>artillery -- passed through Cizre yesterday. </p><p>Preparations for a possible refugee influx into </p><p>Turkey continue. It is said that 75 teachers will </p><p>be assigned to tents to be set up for  refugees </p><p>on the Turkish side of the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milliyet: It is reported that the </p><p>infrastructure improvement projects at Incirlik </p><p>AB have been expedited, and that a large number </p><p>of heavy-duty machines were seen digging a three </p><p>meter deep pit in the size of a soccer field. It </p><p>is said that the excavations were made for </p><p>building new hangars.  An increase in the number </p><p>of tents at the site allocated for ONW soldiers </p><p>was also reported. The number of "giant tents" </p><p>increased to three during the weekend. It is said </p><p>that these giant tents will be used as a </p><p>revolving door by the US troops when the Turkish </p><p>national Assembly authorizes deployment of US </p><p>forces in Turkey. It is also reported that the </p><p>ground where the US tankers are located has been </p><p>hardened, and painting of the runways has been </p><p>completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Cumhuriyet: It is reported that the United </p><p>States has asked the Turkish government to double </p><p>the capacity of Incirlik AB or else build a new </p><p>base similar to the one in Incirlik in Batman. In </p><p>addition to the current issues and hot </p><p>developments in the region, bilateral long-term </p><p>strategic talks are also taking place between the </p><p>two governments. </p><p>The US wants to use Turkey as a "central logistic </p><p>base" for its plans to shape the Middle East and </p><p>Caspian and Balkan triangle in the 21st century, </p><p>and therefore wants to use almost all Turkish </p><p>ports and airports from which military aircraft </p><p>could operate. It is reported that the US has </p><p>made the following demands from the Turkish </p><p>government. </p><p>- Sign a new agreement for doubling the capacity </p><p>of Incirlik AB. </p><p>- If that doesn\'t work, turn over the Batman base </p><p>and the  installations around the base. </p><p>- During the use of airports and ports by the </p><p>Turkish military, there may be a shortage of </p><p>warehouse space. Therefore we should work on a </p><p>rental arrangement for the areas surrounding the </p><p>bases. </p><p>- We should also work on the railway and roads to </p><p>facilitate our transportation. </p><p>8.  Bolge: As the possible war on Iraq </p><p>approaches, government officials have not </p><p>disclosed how they are going to provide for </p><p>citizens\' security.  The people of Adana do not </p><p>know what to do in the case of an attack by Iraq </p><p>using weapons of mass destruction. Civil defense </p><p>authorities said they had determined the type of </p><p>precautions to be undertaken in case of an </p><p>attack, but because they had not received </p><p>approval from the governor\'s office, they </p><p>couldn\'t announce it to the public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye: A spokeswoman for the Women\'s </p><p>Platform of the Human Rights Association\'s </p><p>Diyarbakir chapter said the number of sexual- </p><p>harassment and rape cases in Mardin has increased </p><p>recently. She said a 12 year old girl was </p><p>recently found to have been trafficked and </p><p>serially raped, even by government officials. The </p><p>investigation caused detention of many government </p><p>officials, and the investigation continues. Necla </p><p>Akdeniz, another girl, who was raped by village </p><p>guards in Mardin, was subsequently shot to death </p><p>by her own family. A girl named Semsiye was also </p><p>killed; her head was bashed in with stones, for </p><p>having a forbidden love affair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Evrensel: 2500 Petrol-Is Union members in </p><p>Batman who did not receive their overtime pays </p><p>for four months will go on strike today and press </p><p>for 700 contracted workers whose contracts will </p><p>end in March to be put on permanent payroll. The </p><p>union\'s Batman chapter president, Nimetullah </p><p>Sozen, said their unpaid overtime totaled to TL </p><p>800 billion ($620 thousand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Sabah: Adana mayor, Aytac Durak, who did not </p><p>report 38 pieces of real estate and 583,825 </p><p>square meters of land in his statement to the tax </p><p>office faces a court hearing on March 13. If </p><p>Mayor Durak fails to persuade the jury about the </p><p>shortcomings in his statement he will face an </p><p>imprisonment term from 3 to 8 years and will be </p><p>banned for life from public service. As a result </p><p>of a tip-off, the Interior Ministry launched an </p><p>investigation in 2001 and his file was submitted </p><p>to Chief Public Prosecutor\'s Office of Adana. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
