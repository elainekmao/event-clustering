<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DS/DSS/ITA, AND DS/OP/EAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRO-PEACE RALLY AT EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 0651 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  During the afternoon of March 19, a group of </p><p>approximately 30 school-age children (apparently in their </p><p>early teens at the oldest) suddenly appeared at the front of </p><p>the Chancery chanting -- in English -- "peace for Iraq" and </p><p>"no war," and holding up a few pro-peace posters (also in </p><p>English).  One student presented one poster subsequently to </p><p>RSO, and expressed Vietnam\'s wish for peace in light of its </p><p>own experiences with war.  According to some in the crowd, </p><p>the demonstrators were all students at Ngo Si Lien School. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Within a few minutes of the beginning of the </p><p>demonstration, several dozen additional local police arrived </p><p>on the scene and moved the protesters to the sidewalk across </p><p>the street from the Embassy.  They did not otherwise try to </p><p>break up the demonstration and instead stood facing them, </p><p>and helping to direct traffic.  Crowds of onlookers quickly </p><p>outnumbered the students but did not join in the chanting. </p><p>A few passers-by on motorcycle raised their fists when they </p><p>saw the demonstrators, apparently in support. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  One older man, apparently not connected with the </p><p>students and apparently drunk or on drugs, took off his </p><p>shirt, cut himself, and tried to spread his blood on shrubs </p><p>and the ground.  Police restrained him and eventually took </p><p>him into custody. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The student protesters remained on the scene for </p><p>about one hour.  As far as Embassy knows, none were detained </p><p>or taken into custody.  Several photographers, both still </p><p>and videocam, covered the protest.  Embassy expects press </p><p>coverage on the evening television news March 19 and in </p><p>newspapers on March 20. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Comment:  Unlike the well-staged "mass" rallies and </p><p>demonstrations (ref), this event appears to have been </p><p>slightly more spontaneous (even if still orchestrated by </p><p>school teachers and authorities) than the norm for Vietnam. </p><p>We expect the number and intensity of these protests to grow </p><p>as military action against Iraq grows more imminent and </p><p>after the offset of any hostilities.  We continue to expect </p><p>that Vietnamese security officials will keep these </p><p>demonstrations well under control, however. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
