<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001302 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, ETRD, VM, SOE, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: HCMC DEPT. OF TRADE LOVES BTA, BUT WHAT IS IT EXACTLY? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) TRADE </p><p>DEPT. TOLD CG YAMAUCHI IN A NOVEMBER 13 COURTESY CALL </p><p>THAT HCMC HAS HIGH HOPES FOR THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA), BUT IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE TREATY AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT.  SHE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z </p><p>SAID SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH THE CONSULATE AND AMCHAM </p><p>TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BTA WITH LOCAL BUSINESS, </p><p>SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BTA. </p><p>EVEN THOUGH HER DEPARTMENT CONTROLS A NUMBER OF STATE- </p><p>OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES), THE DIRECTOR CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR WAS VITAL TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND WOULD </p><p>GENERATE MUCH OF THE EXPORT GROWTH TO BE REALIZED </p><p>THROUGH THE BTA.  EQUITIZATION OF SOES WOULD CONTINUE, </p><p>BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BTA A HIT IN HCMC, BUT DO WE UNDERSTAND IT? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>2.   CG YAMAUCHI, ACCOMPANIED BY ECONOFF, PAID A </p><p>NOVEMBER 13 COURTESY CALL ON MS. PHAM THI KIM HONG, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE. </p><p>IN THIS MEETING MS. HONG ADDED HER VOICE TO THE CHORUS </p><p>OF LOCAL BUSINESSPEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO </p><p>SEE THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT AS A NEW STARTING </p><p>POINT FOR VIETNAM - U.S. RELATIONS AND AN EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL BUSINESS. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>IMPORTANT, SHE SAID, TO HCMC, WHICH GENERATES ROUGHLY </p><p>40% OF VIETNAM\'S EXPORT TURNOVER.  LIKE MANY, HOWEVER, </p><p>SHE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE TREATY WAS COMPLEX AND </p><p>ITS DETAILS LARGELY UNKNOWN TO THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE </p><p>HERE - BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND IN BUSINESS - WHO MUST </p><p>IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR ITS PROVISIONS.  SHE URGED THE CG </p><p>TO ESTABLISH STRONG LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>COOPERATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS </p><p>TO SEE THAT BTA IMPLEMENTATION IS A SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE DIRECTOR STRESSED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z </p><p>WAS WORKING HARD TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO BUSINESSES IN HCMC REGARDING BOTH DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE.  THE BTA WAS A PARTICULAR </p><p>CHALLENGE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DIGESTIBLE, PRACTICAL </p><p>INFORMATION, BUT IT HAS GENERATED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF </p><p>INTEREST.  THE TRADE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY HELD A SEMINAR </p><p>ON THE BTA THAT WAS VASTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED BY </p><p>BUSINESSPEOPLE EAGER TO UNDERSTAND ITS PROVISIONS.  NOT </p><p>ONLY WAS THE BTA DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, DIRECTOR HONG </p><p>SAID, BUT SINCE MOST VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES DO NOT YET </p><p>HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THEY WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>RELY ON MIDDLEMEN TO GET THEIR PRODUCT TO EXPORT. </p><p>BUSINESSES WANTED TO FIND WAYS TO WORK MORE DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH U.S. CUSTOMERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MS. HONG SUGGESTED THAT HER DEPARTMENT WORK CLOSELY </p><p>WITH THE CONSULATE AND AMCHAM TO PROVIDE MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE BTA AND HOW TO TRANSLATE IT INTO </p><p>ACTION.  SHE WANTED TO DISTILL THE TREATY INTO SIMPLER </p><p>LANGUAGE THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE COULD </p><p>UNDERSTAND.  SHE POINTED TO AN UPCOMING SEAFOOD SEMINAR </p><p>THAT AMCHAM IS HOSTING LATER THIS MONTH AS AN IDEAL </p><p>EXAMPLE OF WHAT VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING FOR. </p><p>(NOTE:  THE CONGEN WILL BE DELIVERING OPENING REMARKS </p><p>AT THIS SEMINAR.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  CG ASKED IF A SMALL WORKING GROUP COMPOSED OF THE </p><p>CONSULATE, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, AND PERHAPS AMCHAM </p><p>WOULD BE HELPFUL IN DISCUSSING BTA ISSUES AT THE LOCAL </p><p>LEVEL, SHARING INFORMATION AND NEEDS.  THE DIRECTOR </p><p>AGREED, AND SAID SHE WOULD DISCUSS THIS IDEA WITH HER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z </p><p>STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR\'S VITAL ROLE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>6.  THE DIRECTOR STRESSED THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE </p><p>MANY POWERFUL STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES IN HCMC, SOME OF </p><p>WHICH WERE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF HER DEPARTMENT, </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT DISCRIMINATE IN FAVOR OF THESE </p><p>SOES.  IN MS. HONG\'S VIEW, THE PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD </p><p>GENERATE MUCH OF THE GROWTH AS A RESULT OF BTA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  WHEN ECONOFF ASKED IF IT WERE CORRECT </p><p>THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF EXPORTS FROM HCMC WERE IN </p><p>FACT FROM SOES, MS. HONG NOTED THAT ACCORDING TO </p><p>OFFICIAL STATISTICS THAT WAS INDEED CORRECT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>SHE DOUBTED THEIR ACCURACY.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>MEASURE THE TRUE VALUE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PRODUCTION AND </p><p>EXPORTS, SHE STATED.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT MANY SMALL </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES EXPORT VIA SOES WHICH MAY </p><p>DISTORT THE STATISTICS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CURRENTLY THE U.S. MARKET ONLY TAKES ABOUT 17% OF </p><p>HCMC\'S EXPORT TURNOVER.  MS. HONG ANTICIPATES THAT WITH </p><p>THE BTA THIS SHARE WILL GROW DRAMATICALLY, MOSTLY WITH </p><p>EXPORTS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  SHE HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>FOOTWARE, GARMENTS, AND SEAFOOD AS PARTICULARLY </p><p>IMPORTANT EXPORT PRODUCTS FOR THE REGION.  SHE FURTHER </p><p>STATED THAT SINCE MANY MAJOR U.S. COMPANIES HAVE A </p><p>PRESENCE IN HCMC, IMPORTS FROM THE U.S. SHOULD ALSO </p><p>INCREASE DRAMATICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>EQUTIZING SOES TAKES TIME </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01302  02 OF 02  160949Z </p><p>8.  CG INQUIRED ABOUT THE HCMC GOVERNMENT\'S PLANS TO </p><p>EQUITIZE MOST OF THE COMPANIES COMPRISING SAIGON </p><p>TRADING CORPORATION, OR SATRA, WHICH IS AN SOE MANAGED </p><p>BY THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF TRADE.  SATRA CONSISTS OF 23 </p><p>AFFILIATES, 3 JOINT STOCK COMPANIES, AND 3 JOINT </p><p>VENTURES, AND EMPLOYS ABOUT 19,000 PEOPLE.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, THE CITY WILL EQUITIZE 17 </p><p>AFFILIATES OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  DIRECTOR HONG </p><p>INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH EQUITIZATION WAS A </p><p>GOAL AND INCORPORATED INTO AN OVERALL PLAN, IN REALITY </p><p>IT WOULD NOT OCCUR QUICKLY.  THIS WAS DUE TO SOME OF </p><p>THE AFFILIATES AND PROBLEMS WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WORKING TO BLOCK THIS INITIATIVE.  SHE DID POINT OUT IT </p><p>WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT, AND THAT IN THE PAST </p><p>IT HAD MANAGED 50-60 SOES, MANY OF WHICH HAD ALREADY </p><p>BEEN SPUN OFF.  ALTHOUGH THE CITY WOULD STILL WANT TO </p><p>RETAIN CONTROL OF KEY SECTORS SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, IT </p><p>WAS COMMITTED TO EQUITIZING OTHER SOES UNDER ITS </p><p>CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT STILL CONTROLS A NUMBER </p><p>OF SOES, DIRECTOR HONG STRESSED THAT THE TRADE </p><p>DEPARTMENT WAS WORKING TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN ITS TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES.  SHE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN LAST MONTH\'S </p><p>HCMC EXPO WERE PRIVATE COMPANIES.  IN ORDER FOR THE </p><p>CITY TO DEVELOP, THE PRIVATE SECTOR MUST PLAY A VITAL </p><p>ROLE, SHE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>CONDOLENCES </p><p>----------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01302  02 OF 02  160949Z </p><p>10.  AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEETING, THE DIRECTOR STATED </p><p>THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF THE PLANE CRASH IN NEW YORK THAT </p><p>HAD HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE.  SHE EXTENDED HER </p><p>CONDOLENCES TO THE U.S. AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE </p><p>VICTIMS.  CG THANKED HER AND STATED THAT EVEN IN THIS </p><p>DIFFICULT PERIOD, THE U.S. WAS A RESILIENT NATION AND </p><p>THAT WE STILL WANTED TO WORK HARD WITH VIETNAM ON </p><p>BUILDING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  MS. HONG IS A DYNAMIC INTERLOCUTOR AND THERE WAS </p><p>NO MISTAKING HER PLEAS FOR ASSISTANCE.  SHE REALIZES </p><p>THAT THE BTA IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR HCMC, BUT SHE </p><p>ALSO KNOWS THAT UNLESS LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS </p><p>PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TREATY\'S PROVISIONS </p><p>AND ACT UPON THEM, THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL PASS THEM BY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  MS. HONG IS COMPLETING HER FOURTH YEAR AS THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, AND CLEARLY </p><p>DOES NOT WANT HCMC TO BE OUTSHONE AS VIETNAM\'S PRE- </p><p>EMINENT COMMERCIAL ENGINE.  SHE WANTS THE CONGEN AS AN </p><p>ALLY.  OF THE SEVERAL COURTESY CALLS THE CG HAS MADE ON </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS, MS. HONG IS THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS </p><p>SO EXPLICITLY STATED HER CONCERNS ABOUT HCMC\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO MEET PEOPLE\'S EXPECTATIONS OF THE BTA.  POST WILL BE </p><p>LOOKING TO REGULARIZE COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF TRADE ON BTA ISSUES AND ENSURE THEY ARE INCLUDED IN </p><p>ALL RELEVANT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SEMINARS. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01302  02 OF 02  160949Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
