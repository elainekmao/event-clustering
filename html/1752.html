<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO DROPS FOUR MINISTERS, FOUR SENIOR ADVISORS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1312 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 0201 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5(B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) On June 12, President Obasanjo dropped four Ministers </p><p>and four Senior Advisors from his Administration, one </p><p>spokesman framing the changes in terms of "accountability, </p><p>performance, and integrity."  So far, three replacements have </p><p>been named for the Ministers, none for the Advisors.  It </p><p>appears that two Ministers fell due to on-going feuds with </p><p>their home state Governors, the two others due to lack of </p><p>performance.  Similarly, two advisors fell for poor </p><p>performance, one for tensions with his Governor, and one for </p><p>medical reasons.  Overall, the changes represent a modest </p><p>repositioning of the Administration\'s focus on delivering </p><p>real benefits to Nigerians, and replacing those who threaten </p><p>harmonious relations with state executives essential to </p><p>re-election bids in 2003.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On June 12, in a surprise evening statement issued by </p><p>the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ufot </p><p>Ekaette, the Obasanjo Administration announced that four </p><p>Ministers and four Senior Advisors had been dropped: Minister </p><p>of Water Resources Col. (Ret.) Mohammed Kaliel; Minister of </p><p>Communications Mohammed Arzika; Minister of State for the </p><p>Federal Capital Territory Solomon Ewuga; Minister of State </p><p>for Power and Steel Danjuma Goje; Special Advisor for </p><p>Economic Affairs Phillip Asiodu; Special Advisor for </p><p>International Relations Dr. Patrick Dele-Cole; Senior Special </p><p>Assistant for Drugs and Financial Crimes Dr. Irahim Lame, and </p><p>Special Assistant for Special Duties Dr. Bukola Saraki. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Three Dropped for Feuding </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) Several sources within the Presidency confirmed to us </p><p>the dismissal from the Administration of officials who had </p><p>been quarreling with their home state Governors, a notable </p><p>offense in contemporary Nigerian politics, even where the </p><p>Governor in question is of an opposition political party. </p><p>According to Minister of Information Jerry Gana, who met with </p><p>Poloff June 14, both Ministers of State, Solomon Ewuga and </p><p>Danjuma Goje, fell due to on-going disputes with their </p><p>Governors (Abdullahi Adamu of Nassarawa (PDP) and Abubakar </p><p>Hashidu of Gombe (APP), respectively).  Gana noted that he </p><p>had personally tried to intercede several times in Nassarawa, </p><p>considering both men to be "friends," but had not succeeded </p><p>in reconciling them.  Ewuga had been elected as Deputy </p><p>Governor under Adamu under the banner of the ruling People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party in 1999, and the two men had "fought" </p><p>continually ever since, Gana noted.  He also briefly noted </p><p>that Goje had very sour relations with the Gombe State </p><p>Governor, a member of the opposition All People\'s Democratic </p><p>Party.  Among the Advisors, Gana named Dr. Lame as one guilty </p><p>of quite poor relations with Governor Adamu Mu\'azu of Bauchi </p><p>State (PDP).  A senior Presidency official made similar </p><p>comments to DCM the evening of June 13, saying that Obasanjo </p><p>had twice admonished Ministers to "respect the Governors\' </p><p>executive authority."  Said Gana, summing up the nature of </p><p>the offense: "Governors have a stronger voice." (Comment: </p><p>Several APP Governors-elect, including Hashidu of Gombe, </p><p>quietly swung their states behind Obasanjo in the 1999 </p><p>Presidential elections.  End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Four Canned for Poor Performance </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) Gana cited Minister Kaliel of Water Resources and </p><p>Minister Arzika of Communications for particularly poor </p><p>performance (Adobe Obe, Special Assistant to President </p><p>Obasanjo, echoed this assessment in a separate conversation). </p><p> He noted that the President, and indeed the entire Federal </p><p>Executive Council (the Nigerian Cabinet) had been incensed at </p><p>the lack of any real progress on water projects nation-wide </p><p>from the Federal Government.  "The State Governments are </p><p>delivering," said Gana, "but we do nothing."  Two months ago, </p><p>said Gana, the President delivered an ultimatum to Kaliel: </p><p>show results on the ground or face dismissal.  The earlier </p><p>pledge by the Obasanjo Administration to complete at least </p><p>two borehole projects in each of the nation\'s 774 local </p><p>government councils would be the test.  Said Gana, "they did </p><p>little or nothing since then." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Alluding to rampant corruption in the Ministry, Gana </p><p>then said that "they exercised very poor oversight," and </p><p>"fell in with the wrong crowd of contractors."  Many </p><p>contracts went no further than the collection of </p><p>"mobilization fees" by contractors, who took the start-up </p><p>money and "disappeared."  Gana also briefly noted that Arzika </p><p>had never made any progress in updating the nation\'s </p><p>telecommunications infrastructure (sources at the Central </p><p>Bank also told Econoff June 14 that he resolutely opposed </p><p>privatization of NITEL, the telephone parastatal).  Gana put </p><p>the failings of the two Ministers this way: "Lights, phones, </p><p>water; those three things we must do.  The guys at Power and </p><p>Steel are making some progress.  These guys did not." </p><p>6.  (C) Gana then commented briefly on the performance of </p><p>Phillip Asiodu.  Agreeing that Asiodu had been warring with </p><p>the office of the Vice President for months, he said Asiodu </p><p>was "out of touch, out of date, unable to keep up."  Former </p><p>Chief of Staff to Asiodu, Chief Akindele, told Poloff June 13 </p><p>that Asiodu\'s dismissal had been pending for several months, </p><p>and that the "friction" with the Vice President had never </p><p>been dealt with properly.  "Asiodu did not manage his </p><p>relationship with the Vice President."  Akindele also noted </p><p>that "the Vice President\'s office duplicated everything we </p><p>were doing," leaving little independence to Asiodu\'s </p><p>operations. (Comment: The Office of the Vice President has </p><p>broad supervisory authority on privatization and deregulation </p><p>efforts, in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Enterprises </p><p>(BPE). End Comment).  Akindele, who resigned two months ago, </p><p>said that, "the President told me himself when I left that he </p><p>would fire Asiodu soon."  Econoff received similar messages </p><p>from Akindele and BPE\'s Nasir Al-Rufai in recent weeks.  In </p><p>fact, at one point, Econoff was asked by advisors to both </p><p>Asiodu and the Vice President to "back" their principals for </p><p>the lead on bilateral economic relations with the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Similarly, Special Assistant Bukola Saraki, Gana </p><p>said, had been dismissed for performance well below that </p><p>expected by the President.  Gana said Saraki (son of APP </p><p>power-broker Olusola Saraki) had formed part of a "crack" </p><p>intelligence unit within the Presidency, a unit intended to </p><p>be "the eyes and ears" of the President, focusing on field </p><p>oversight of Ministerial performance.  The President wanted </p><p>to be able to puncture the performance claims of Ministers </p><p>with his own gimlet-eyed reports on their supposed </p><p>achievements, but the unit "mainly stayed in the office," and </p><p>never functioned as intended, Gana said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One Dropped for Health Reasons </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>8.  (C) Gana said that Special Advisor for International </p><p>Affairs  Dr. Patrick Dele-Cole was the one official dropped </p><p>for purely personal reasons, due to his failing health.  Dele </p><p>Cole (long known to be exhausted by the long hours and fast </p><p>pace in the immediate vicinity of the President) had </p><p>developed an embarrassing tendency to drift off to sleep in </p><p>meetings with foreign Heads of State.  Chairman of the House </p><p>Committee on Foreign Affairs Adamu Bulkachuwa also mentioned </p><p>this to Poloff June 13.  (From our own experience, Dele-Cole </p><p>fell into a noisy slumber in four separate meetings during </p><p>Obasanjo,s recent Washington visit, to the palpably deep </p><p>embarrassment of his Nigerian colleagues).  Gana said </p><p>Dele-Cole needed surgery for the condition, which involved an </p><p>inability to sleep when prostrate.  "Some sort of nasal </p><p>blockage," Gana said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Time for Plans is Over: We Need Results </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>9.  (C) Gana finished by saying that hard work, good plans </p><p>and the best of intentions on the part of Ministers and </p><p>Advisors were no longer enough.  "We need results."  The </p><p>President and others in the Administration were keenly aware </p><p>that Nigerians wanted to see their lives getting better </p><p>"now."  What they see, he said candidly, is "high prices, gas </p><p>lines, no water."  Gana suggested that the present changes in </p><p>the Administration\'s personnel would likely "not be the only </p><p>ones," as the President was determined to find the "right </p><p>mix" and "make things happen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Three Replacements Named </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>10.  (C) The Obasanjo team submitted three nominations for </p><p>the four vacated Ministerial posts, former Customs Controller </p><p>General Bello Mohammed, former Sokoto Attorney General </p><p>Mukhtari Shagari (son of former Head of State Shehu Shagari) </p><p>and businessman Murtala Aliyu.  They will likely replace </p><p>Arzika at Communications, Kaliel at Water Resources and Goje </p><p>at Power and Steel, respectively (in Nigerian practice, </p><p>nominations are never made for particular positions, but the </p><p>usual protocol is to replace one state\'s failed Minister with </p><p>a resident of the same state).  No nominations have yet been </p><p>submitted for the Advisor positions (the Special Advisor </p><p>positions also require Senate confirmation).  In </p><p>conversations with DCM June 13, Senate President Anyim Pius </p><p>Anyim said that no Minister of State would be nominated for </p><p>the FCT, as the senior Minister, Abba-Gana, would be given </p><p>time to "make his mark" on his own (he has been in office </p><p>since the last Cabinet shake-up in February.  Reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  (C) The Obasanjo Administration\'s small Cabinet shake-up </p><p>reflects a growing realization that measurable results are </p><p>increasingly important as it begins its third year in office, </p><p>an imperative we highlighted in our review of the </p><p>Administration\'s first two years, Ref A.  Nasir Al-Rufai </p><p>previously identified Asiodu and Arzika to us as two of the </p><p>five ministers most opposed to privatization; we may now see </p><p>a modest quickening of the move toward privatized state </p><p>entities.  Dropping Ministers and others who clash with their </p><p>home state Governors also reflects the premium value Obasanjo </p><p>places on good relations with the nation\'s 36 state </p><p>Governors, who are now real players on the national political </p><p>scene, and a growing political phenomenon.  The Governors\' </p><p>good wishes (or at least tolerance) are essential to any </p><p>Presidential nominee\'s chances in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Comment Continued.  Unfortunately, geo-political </p><p>balancing requires that state and regional interests often </p><p>take precedence over acumen and experience: we will now </p><p>likely have a lawyer at Water Resources, a retired Customs </p><p>official at Communications, and a businessman at Power and </p><p>Steel (this last making the most sense to us in terms of </p><p>actual experience).  The need for results once again </p><p>conflicts at least in part with the need to shore up </p><p>political support and maintain the carefully negotiated </p><p>parceling out of senior government positions.  Real progress </p><p>for average Nigerians may not be the result.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
