Responding to </p><p>journalists\' questions following an hour-long meeting with </p><p>PM Gul, Biden said that the US Administration and the </p><p>congress agree on Iraq\'s territorial integrity, and that he </p><p>and Senator Hagel had stressed that point during meetings </p><p>with Kurdish leaders in Northern Iraq.  Responding to a </p><p>question, Senator Biden said that progress on a solution in </p><p>Cyprus will be an important factor in the U.S. Congress\' </p><p>consideration of economic assistance to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: Today\'s papers give extensive front-page coverage to the </p><p>harsh warnings made by AKP leader Erdogan in Copenhagen.  In </p><p>his speech, Erdogan urged the EU to abandon its `double </p><p>standards,\' and warned that the EU should be ready to face </p><p>the consequences if it refuses to give a date to Turkey. </p><p>Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen rejected the charge of a </p><p>double standard, and said that EU criteria should be met in </p><p>practice, not only on paper.  "Hurriyet" says in a banner </p><p>front-page headline that the Copenhagen decision would be a </p><p>test for EU civilization.  "Milliyet" reports that AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan presented a letter of intent to the EU term </p><p>president yesterday.  In the letter, Turkey pledges to help </p><p>convince TRNC president Denktas to seek a solution in Cyprus </p><p>if Turkey is given negotiation date.  "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>that President Sezer announced that he will not go to </p><p>Copenhagen to protest the EU decision not to set a date for </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: "Hurriyet" reports that a delegation of Turkish air </p><p>force officials went to Germany for talks with US officials </p><p>about the US demands for using Turkish airspace and air </p><p>bases in a possible operation against Iraq.  During the </p><p>meetings, the Turkish delegation will reportedly demand the </p><p>deployment of Patriot air defense systems, satellite </p><p>connection with the air bases, and installation of new </p><p>equipment at the bases.  "Hurriyet" also reports that EUCOM </p><p>Deputy Commander Charles Wald `secretly\' arrived in Ankara </p><p>for important contacts.  General Wald had meetings with </p><p>Turkish Deputy Chief of General Staff Yasar Buyukanit and </p><p>Air Force Commander General Cumhur Asparuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AKP Leader Erdogan\'s Visit to US: "Zaman" reports that </p><p>Erdogan will meet with President Bush today at the White </p><p>House.  The meeting will focus on Turkish support for a </p><p>possible operation against Iraq, the Cyprus issue, and </p><p>Turkey\'s EU accession.  "Hurriyet" says that if the meeting </p><p>with Erdogan is successful, President Bush might launch a </p><p>new diplomatic campaign in support of Turkey by calling EU </p><p>leaders.  "Sabah" reports that Erdogan will face a </p><p>leadership test in Washington, and adds that the US will ask </p><p>for Turkish support in a possible operation against Iraq. </p><p>However, the US will not change its plan if Turkey refuses </p><p>to give support.  In that event, however, the US would feel </p><p>obliged to compensate Turkey for its potential losses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The critical week in Turkey\'s relations with the West" </p><p>Sedat Ergin draws a parallel between EU membership and an </p><p>Iraq operation in mass appeal Hurriyet (12/10): "The current </p><p>situation vis--vis Turkey and the EU creates an equilibrium </p><p>regarding relations with the West, and it will be </p><p>interesting to watch Turkish public opinion on both the </p><p>Cyprus and Iraq issues.  . The Cyprus issue is the weakest </p><p>link, because overall public opinion is very much concerned. </p><p>It is because the EU asks Turkey for serious concessions on </p><p>Cyprus and hints that it would be helpful for Turkey\'s </p><p>efforts to be given a membership date.  Yet Turkey is </p><p>worried that it could lose all of its trump cards and be </p><p>left empty-handed.  . The second link in this equilibrium is </p><p>the Iraq issue.  Today, the US President will most likely </p><p>call on the EU to give a date for Turkey after his meeting </p><p>with AKP leader Erdogan.  One of the reasons for the Bush </p><p>administration\'s staunch support for Turkey\'s EU membership </p><p>is Iraq.  A disappointing decision from the Copenhagen </p><p>summit will create a very negative atmosphere in Turkish </p><p>public opinion, to the point at which it would be very </p><p>difficult for the Turkish government to be persuasive for a </p><p>military operation in Iraq.  In this case, the Turkish </p><p>public, given their general anger with the West, would be </p><p>seriously opposed to a war in Iraq and would refuse to serve </p><p>to western interests." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq and EU" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna editorialized in mass appeal-conservative </p><p>Turkiye (12/10): "US preparations are clearly underway, and </p><p>Washington is determined to topple Saddam at all costs. </p><p>Following the recent visit to the Kurdish parliament by two </p><p>distinguished US senators, we might draw the conclusion that </p><p>once Saddam is gone, the Kurdish-controlled region will be </p><p>given autonomy.  After all, the Gulf regimes are disturbed </p><p>by the fact that Saddam\'s regime has weapons of mass </p><p>destruction, so they have started to cooperate with </p><p>Washington.  . AKP leader Erdogan meanwhile is going to </p><p>discuss Iraq, the EU, and Cyprus with President Bush.  All </p><p>three issues are interrelated, and should be handled with </p><p>great care and attention.  Based on the decisions made on </p><p>these issues, Turkish foreign policy will be shaped for </p><p>years to come." </p><p></p></div>
