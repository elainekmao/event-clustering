<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GERARDI SUPREME COURT APPEAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 2649 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 248 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: On January 31, the Supreme Court Chamber of </p><p>Appeals held the public audience of the latest appeal in the </p><p>Gerardi case.  The Archbishop\'s Office on Human Rights (ODHA) </p><p>and the Public Ministry presented their appeals of the fourth </p><p>appeals court\'s October 8, 2002 decision (Ref A) to annul the </p><p>2001 conviction and order a retrial.  The Ambassador attended </p><p>the judicial proceedings to show USG interest in justice </p><p>being done in this case.  The judges are expected to render a </p><p>decision by February 6.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Immediately after the Fourth Appeals Court\'s October 8, </p><p>2002, decision to annul the 2001 sentence condemning four men </p><p>for the murder of Bishop Gerardi, the ODHA presented its </p><p>appeal to the Supreme Court.  The public reading of this </p><p>appeal, as well as the oral arguments of both the defense and </p><p>the prosecution, was held on January 31.  Under Guatemalan </p><p>law, the Supreme Court\'s Chamber of Appeals has three working </p><p>days to come to a decision on the appeal. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The courtroom at the Supreme Court was two-thirds full, </p><p>with the bulk of the audience being international human </p><p>rights advocates and various Guatemalan civil society </p><p>notables.  The Public Ministry presented its appeal first, </p><p>followed by the ODHA.  Both parties argued that the </p><p>overturning of the 2001 sentence was illegal because the </p><p>Fourth Appeals Court did not review all of the evidence. </p><p>They maintained that while Ruben Chanax Sontay\'s testimonies </p><p>from preliminary depositions and the actual 2001 trial were </p><p>contradictory, the rest of their evidence from the 2001 trial </p><p>was solid. </p><p> </p><p>4.  All five defense lawyers, including representation for </p><p>Gerardi\'s absolved maid, Margarita Lopez, presented their </p><p>rebuttals following the prosecution.  They argued that the </p><p>appeals process is a necessary part of the justice system and </p><p>that the Fourth Appeals Court\'s decision should be respected. </p><p> Margarita Lopez\'s lawyer argued that even if a new trial was </p><p>to take place, his client should be removed from the </p><p>proceedings because she was absolved in the 2001 trial. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Immediately following the oral arguments, the court </p><p>adjourned for three working days of deliberations, set to </p><p>conclude on February 6.  The decision will not be released in </p><p>a public audience, but given privately to the parties. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Ambassador greeted human rights activists and press </p><p>after the judicial proceedings.  His attendance at the trial </p><p>was noted in all four leading dailies, and variations on his </p><p>statements regarding support for justice in Guatemala were </p><p>widely quoted.  For example, El Periodico quoted the </p><p>Ambassador as saying his presence at the Gerardi appeal was </p><p>meant as a "sign of solidarity for justice in Guatemala."  At </p><p>a separate event, the Ambassador later met one of the four </p><p>presiding justices, who was pleased by that explanation for </p><p>the Ambassador\'s presence in court. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT: We find the recent death of a Gerardi case </p><p>witness extremely troubling (Ref B), and will be alert to any </p><p>signs that the intimidation of witnesses will impact the </p><p>ruling.  The ODHA appeal is based on legal technicalities </p><p>over procedures followed by the lower appeals court, which </p><p>ordered a retrial based on discrepancies in the testimony of </p><p>one witness.  If the original guilty verdict is confirmed, </p><p>the defendants will return to prison.  If the 2001 sentence </p><p>is annulled, a retrial will put witnesses at risk and delay </p><p>(if not set back) justice.  While ODHA is confident its </p><p>argument will save the earlier conviction, we </p><p></p></div>
