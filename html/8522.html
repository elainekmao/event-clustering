This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for June 05, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet: A political party, under the name </p><p>of "Democratic Republic Party," will be founded </p><p>to substitute DEHAP. The chief prosecutor of the </p><p>Supreme Court had sued DEHAP and demanded its </p><p>permanent closure some time ago. The case is </p><p>still pending. Taking into account the likely </p><p>closure of DEHAP prior to local elections in </p><p>2004, former HADEP members had made preparations </p><p>for founding a new party under Ahmet Turan </p><p>Demir\'s leadership. Demir was one of HADEP\'s </p><p>former chairs. The petition for founding the new </p><p>party will be submitted to the Interior Ministry </p><p>tomorrow. Demir said the new party would follow a </p><p>democratic socialist line. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Sabah: A Republican Peoples Party (CHP) </p><p>parliamentarian from Diyarbakir, Muhsin Kocyigit, </p><p>in a resolution to the Grand National Assembly, </p><p>asked the Interior Minister if  beating and </p><p>placing human excrement on the faces of two </p><p>students in Hani (Diyarbakir) was true or not. It </p><p>is alleged that the police detained, beat, and </p><p>placed human excrement on the faces of two </p><p>students for making insinuating remarks in </p><p>Kurdish to their female teacher at Children\'s Day </p><p>celebrations on April 23. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel/Milliyet: The Diyarbakir governorate </p><p>investigating the (above) case decided that there </p><p>was no solid evidence that the policemen in Hani </p><p>had beaten, toured and placed excrement on the </p><p>faces of students. The governorate dropped </p><p>bringing the policemen to trial, and denied all </p><p>the students\' allegations. Based upon the </p><p>governorate\'s decision, the office of the Chief </p><p>Public Prosecutor in Hani also announced that </p><p>there was no evidence that required bringing </p><p>public charges against the policemen. At a court </p><p>hearing in Hani, the teacher, who had sued the </p><p>students, withdrew her complaint. The court </p><p>adjourned the case to an unspecified date to </p><p>listen to the students\' account of the event. The </p><p>students attorney, Zulfu Dundar, sued the </p><p>policemen, Hasan Sezgin and Ergun Sahin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: At a press meeting in Human Rights </p><p>Association\'s Chapter in Sanliurfa, the Urfa </p><p>Democracy Platform, announced that the "repent </p><p>law" proposed for the Kurdish issue; the </p><p>personnel law damaging reconciliation at job </p><p>sites; the law opening the path for depriving </p><p>laborers of unions; the local administration law; </p><p>and the isolation applied in F-type prisons; had </p><p>increased tension in society. The spokeswoman for </p><p>the platform, Gulay Koca, proposed declaring a </p><p>general amnesty for installing peace and order in </p><p>lieu of the repent law under consideration. </p><p>DEHAP\'s provincial office in Diyarbakir launched </p><p>a three-day signature campaign demanding a </p><p>general amnesty. DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman, </p><p>Firat Anli, asked all segments of society to be </p><p>sensitive about resolving the Kurdish issue, and </p><p>to participate in the signature campaign. </p><p>6.  Hurriyet/Milliyet: Sergeant Matthias Arnt, </p><p>24, was stabbed to death at Incirlik AFB on May </p><p>27. It is suspected that his wife, Latasha Arnt, </p><p>had killed the sergeant.  Latasha was taken to </p><p>the US for trial in California. The Military </p><p>Police are taking care of the crime. In the </p><p>meantime, FBI detectives began an investigation. </p><p>Sergeant Arnt\'s body was taken to Germany for an </p><p>autopsy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye: The Provincial National Education </p><p>Director of Hakkari, Durmus Ozdemir, said he </p><p>needed 706 teachers in the province in order to </p><p>fill in the gap. The national Education Ministry </p><p>announced it would hire twenty thousand teachers </p><p>nationwide. Ozdemir said around four hundred of </p><p>one thousand four hundred sixty teachers </p><p>currently employed in Hakkari would be </p><p>transferred elsewhere. He added that he needed at </p><p>least 650 or 700 teachers in assorted branches, </p><p>and 150 or 200 classroom teachers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Dunya: The General Director of the Iron and </p><p>Steel Plant in Iskenderun (Isdemir), Atamer </p><p>Giyici, said they took the first step for </p><p>modernization and transformation at the plant. </p><p>Giyici said they would invest USD 300 million for </p><p>bringing fine casting technology, and formally </p><p>invited companies interested in the projects </p><p>through the Financial Times and the Official </p><p>Gazette on May 16 to bid, and would receive bids </p><p>until the first week of June. Giyici said USD 700 </p><p>million was required in order to eliminate the </p><p>disorder in long and flat iron production in </p><p>Turkey. The plant would double production after </p><p>the investment, and added that Isdemir had made a </p><p>profit of USD 2 million during the first quarter </p><p>of 2003, and aimed to increase its annual </p><p>capacity to 2.1 million tons. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
