<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, SA/RA AND INL, DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL-GUERNEY </p><p>NEW DELHI FOR DEA AND CUSTOMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MID-YEAR STATUS REPORT ON DRUG TRAFFICKING </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Robert K. Boggs for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepali police have seized 149 kg of cannabis </p><p>and hashish and 6.9 kg of heroin in the first half of 2003, </p><p>up from only 38 kg of hashish and .38 kg of heroin in the </p><p>same period in 2002.  Forty-four Nepali citizens and 8 </p><p>foreigners have been arrested in Nepal, while 12 Nepali </p><p>citizens have been arrested overseas in connection with drug </p><p>trafficking.  Nepali police estimate that domestic production </p><p>of cannabis and hashish is high, but seizures are extremely </p><p>difficult, as most illicit drugs are transported by land to </p><p>India.  Anectodal evidence indicates that Maoist insurgents </p><p>levy a 35 percent tax on the cultivation and transportation </p><p>of cannabis.  Increased evidence of Nepali traffickers\' </p><p>expanding connections with international drug rings has </p><p>raised fears that Nepal will become a transit point for </p><p>heroin and other \'hard drugs\' from India, Pakistan and </p><p>Thailand to North America and Europe.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On June 17, PolOff met with Hemant Malla, </p><p>Superintendant of Police for the Narcotic Drug Control Law </p><p>Enforcement Unit (NDCLEU), to discuss progress on </p><p>interdiction and conviction of drug traffickers in Nepal. </p><p>The NDCLEU has eight satellite units: six in the Terai </p><p>(southern belt), one in Pokhara and one at Tribhuvan </p><p>International Airport outside Kathmandu.  NDCLEU employs 21 </p><p>police officers at the satellite units and 54 officers at </p><p>headquarters in Kathmandu.  Ten of these officers work </p><p>undercover as buyer agents.  (Note.  Most interdictions made </p><p>within Nepal are based on intelligence provided by the </p><p>undercover police officers, not from random searches.  End </p><p>Note.)  According to Malla, the NDCLEU\'s largest operational </p><p>problem is the unpredictable rotation and reassignment of </p><p>police in Nepal; officers may work at the NDCLEU anywhere </p><p>from two months to several years.  (Transfers of civil police </p><p>in Nepal are common throughout the 46,000 strong force as a </p><p>means to limit corruption.)   Malla must constantly train new </p><p>officers, which he does through a team-based approach whereby </p><p>new officers are teamed with more experienced officers in the </p><p>field. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Domestic Production, Consumption and Seizures </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nepal is a source country for cannabis, which is </p><p>exported primarily for consumption in India, and hashish, </p><p>which ends up in North America, Europe and South East Asia. </p><p>According to Malla, Nepal consumes approximately 30 percent </p><p>of its domestically-grown cannabis and hashish as well as </p><p>imported low-grade heroin from Pakistan and India.  Malla </p><p>also reported a growing incidence of methamphetamine use, as </p><p>well as a rise in the abuse of prescription drugs, such as </p><p>tidigesic injectable (synthetic heroin), nitrogepam and </p><p>diagepam. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Illicit growers in Nepal cultivate two breeds of </p><p>marijuana: a \'high breed\' that grows quickly and can be </p><p>harvested three times per year, and a \'Nepali breed,\' in </p><p>higher-demand, that is only harvested twice per year in </p><p>January-February and October-November. The NDCLEU, during the </p><p>first 2003 harvesting season, seized 149 kg of cannabis in </p><p>primarily four districts (Parsa, Bara, Mahattari and </p><p>Makwanpur) in the Terai, the southern lowlands of Nepal. </p><p>This year the NDCLEU also seized 6.9 kg of heroin in transit </p><p>from India, as compared to 6.5 kg by year-end 2002.  In </p><p>connection with these seizures, the NDCLEU arrested 44 Nepali </p><p>citizens and 8 foreigners, including 2 Israelis, 2 Poles, 3 </p><p>Japanese and 1 Burmese.  There have been no seizures of </p><p>precursor chemcials since 1997. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Malla would not estimte the quantity of hashish and </p><p>cannabis exported by land to India, although he believed the </p><p>amount was very high.  Commercial trucks, returning to India </p><p>after delivering goods in Nepal, and private vehicles stash </p><p>illegal drugs in hidden compartments, including inside the </p><p>seats and behind exterior side panelling.  A commercial truck </p><p>can stash 500-700 kilograms of hashish or cannabis, while a </p><p>small private vehicle can easily stash 70 kilograms. </p><p>Interdictions of these vehicles is extremely difficult, said </p><p>Malla, because the India-Nepal border is open and porous, </p><p>with thousands of vehicles crossing by each of the major </p><p>roads every day. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Malla referred to anectdotal evidence that Maoist </p><p>insurgents in the middle hills of Nepal levy a tax on both </p><p>the cultivation and transportation of cannabis.  Much of this </p><p>cannabis is sold to China through rural Dolpa.  Malla </p><p>estimated that the levy was as high as 35 percent of the </p><p>value of the crops. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>International Connections are Growing </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Malla reported that a growing number of Nepali </p><p>citizens are becoming active in the international drug trade. </p><p> For the past six years, the NDCLEU has been working with DEA </p><p>and other international drug control agencies to track three </p><p>drug syndicates, helping in the arrest of over 100 </p><p>traffickers from Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Thailand and </p><p>Nepal.  Malla reported a growth in the number of Nepali </p><p>traffickers, based in Bangkok, who are involved in the </p><p>financing and organizing of drug trafficking.  So far this </p><p>year, 12 Nepali citizens have been arrested outside the </p><p>country for trafficking in hashish, cocaine and heroin, with </p><p>one case linked to methamphetamines.  In one case in early </p><p>June, three Nepalis were arrested in China, near the Nepal </p><p>border, carrying 4 kg of heroin.  Malla said he had evidence </p><p>that Nepali drug traffickers based overseas are expanding </p><p>their connections with Pakistani, Thai, Indian and possibly </p><p>other international drug rings.  (Note.  Three Yakuza were </p><p>detained at Tribhuvan International Airport in early June </p><p>with excessive cash.  End Note.)  He fears that these </p><p>expanding networks will result in Nepal providing a transit </p><p>point for heroin and other \'hard drugs\' from South and South </p><p>East Asia to North America and Europe. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) It is difficult to determine the reason for the </p><p>increase in drug seizures.    However, in view of Nepal\'s </p><p>faltering tourism industry and declining economy, it is </p><p>possible that Nepali farmers are increasing cannabis </p><p>cultivation in order to feed their families and businessmen </p><p>are looking for more lucrative trade.  It is also possible </p><p>that Maoist leaders are encouraging illicit production in an </p><p>effort to fill their depleted war chests.  The open border </p><p>with India will continue to limit severely the ability of law </p><p>enforcement agencies to interdict drug traffickers, creating </p><p>a ripe environment attracting traffickers to Nepal.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
