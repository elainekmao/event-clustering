<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000637 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SF, ZI, NI, SADC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEMARCHE: DEMOCRATIC EXPRESSION CRUSHED </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 76465 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter delivered the demarche </p><p>on Zimbabwe to President Obasanjo on March 26.  At that </p><p>meeting he was joined by British High Commissioner Philip </p><p>Thomas.  Allied with South Africa, the GON opposes </p><p>continued suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, and </p><p>wants to disband the Troika.  Despite Mugabe\'s </p><p>recklessness, publicly ostracizing Mugabe remains </p><p>unacceptable to Obasanjo. For as long as he can, Obasanjo </p><p>will stick to an approach of private dialogue and mild </p><p>suasion in hopes of coaxing Mugabe to soften his violent </p><p>opposition to political reform. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Meeting with President Obasanjo March 26 to </p><p>discuss the crisis in the Niger Delta (septel), British </p><p>High Commissioner Philip Thomas and Ambassador Jeter used </p><p>the meeting as an opportunity to discuss Zimbabwe.  In an </p><p>earlier meeting on the same day, Obasanjo\'s Foreign Affairs </p><p>Advisor Ad\'obe Obe had mentioned that Commonwealth </p><p>Secretary General McKinnon had visited Abuja on March 25 to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>meet Obasanjo and plan next steps in light of the end of </p><p>the one year suspension of Zimbabwe (in March) and current </p><p>events in that country.  After canvassing some Commonwealth </p><p>members, McKinnon had concluded there was a consensus for </p><p>extending the suspension, Ad\'obe said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In the meeting later that night with Obasanjo he </p><p>confirmed that the GON disagreed with McKinnon\'s assertion. </p><p>South Africa also viewed continued suspension as </p><p>unacceptable and supported the reinstatement of Zimbabwe at </p><p>the expiry of the suspension in March.  President Obasanjo </p><p>told Thomas and Jeter that he concurred with Mbeki\'s </p><p>position.  McKinnon was mistaken about consensus within the </p><p>Commonwealth, Obasanjo contended.  South Africa, Nigeria </p><p>and several other African states opposed extending Mugabe\'s </p><p>suspension.  The Commonwealth was effectively at an impasse </p><p>- with Obasanjo and Mbeki representing one stream of </p><p>thought and McKinnon representing its antithesis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Obasanjo continued that McKinnon had developed a </p><p>list of "5-6" issues to raise with Mugabe (Obasanjo avoided </p><p>mentioning the specific issues.)  Obasanjo revealed that </p><p>his gameplan was to visit Zimbabwe after the Nigerian </p><p>elections on April 19.  In Zimbabwe he would personally </p><p>raise these issues with Mugabe and press him to deal with </p><p>these matters.  It was clear that these issues were of </p><p>great concern within the Commonwealth, and it was in </p><p>Mugabe\'s interest to deal with them, Obasanjo declared, </p><p>contending that he "would find a way to help Mugabe out of </p><p>his current predicament." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Obasanjo further stated that after delivering his </p><p>message to Mugabe, the Commonwealth should wait a </p><p>"reasonable period" to give Mugabe a chance to act.  After </p><p>that, the body should decide if the Zimbabwean President </p><p>should be invited to the Commonwealth Heads of Government </p><p>Meeting (CHOGM) if the suspension should be reactivated. </p><p>If Mugabe made favorable progress, Obasanjo said he favored </p><p>Mugabe\'s return to the fold in time to attend the CHOGM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Obasanjo also said he supported Mbeki\'s position </p><p>that the Troika (Australia, South Africa and Nigeria) </p><p>should be disbanded.  His chain of logic was that sanctions </p><p>should not be automatically extended since there was no </p><p>consensus in the Commonwealth for sanctions.  If sanctions </p><p>were no longer valid, then the Troika had lost its reason </p><p>of existence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In response to Thomas\' question about Mugabe </p><p>stepping down, Obasanjo responded the British were not </p><p>approaching this sensitive matter properly.  Obasanjo said </p><p>he had no difficulty raising the issue of retirement with </p><p>Mugabe; the key was how to put the issue to him.  Mugabe </p><p>had to be convinced that it would be in his own interests </p><p>to leave office, and that conclusion could not be reached </p><p>through direct confrontation with him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  The Troika is split, perhaps irrevocably </p><p>so.  Unfortunately, Zimbabwe became an "us versus them" </p><p>issue within the Troika with South Africa managing to pull </p><p>Nigeria its way.  This probably did not take heavy exertion </p><p>on Pretoria\'s part. Still, there ultimately may be some </p><p>space between the Nigerian and South African positions. </p><p>Nigeria sides with South Africa on ending the suspension </p><p>and on the fate of the Troika; however, Nigeria also seems </p><p>to realize that, at some point in the not too distant </p><p>future, defending Zimbabwe will become untenable.  For now, </p><p>however, Nigeria is seeking every out, not only for Mugabe, </p><p>but for itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment Continued:  Nigeria does not want to </p><p>condemn an old ally and a leader who once symbolized </p><p>African liberation.  Thus, Nigeria will temporize and will </p><p>be loathe to criticize Mugabe too harshly.  The Nigerian </p><p>preference is: (1) to meet with Mugabe in late April, (2) </p><p>in order to raise the "concerns" of the Commonwealth, (3) </p><p>with a decision on reinstating Zimbabwe (4) delayed until </p><p>Mugabe has a chance to address these concerns is </p><p>characteristic of this mind-set. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
