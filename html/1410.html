(C) ON DECEMBER 7 DCM HAD BREAKFAST WITH A VERY </p><p>TIRED DAVID HAMADZIRIPI, A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CURRENTLY POSTED IN </p><p>KINSHASA.  THE ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT, WHO ATTENDED THE DRC </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT MEETING IN HARARE, REPORTED THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT EXPECTED THE SIGNING CEREMONY TO BE NON- </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL, BUT NEGOTIATIONS THAT BEGAN ON DECEMBER 5 </p><p>STRETCHED INTO THE EARLY HOURS OF THE NEXT MORNING.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE CONGOLESE REBEL </p><p>MOVEMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE MOVEMENT FOR THE LIBERATION </p><p>OF THE CONGO (MLC), OBJECTED TO THE JOINT POLITICAL </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S ADOPTION OF THE SUB-PLANS FOR THE </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT AND REDEPLOYMENT OF FORCES IN THE FOUR </p><p>MILITARY SECTORS OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO </p><p>(DRC)(REFTEL).  THE MLC, WHICH WAS REPRESENTED AT THE </p><p>MINISTERIAL-LEVEL MEETING BY ITS RELATIVELY JUNIOR </p><p>MEMBER ON THE JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION, REFUSED TO SIGN </p><p>CLAIMING HIS MOVEMENT WOULD ONLY DO SO WHEN THE INTERNAL </p><p>DIALOGUE IN THE DRC HAD BEGUN.  HAMADZIRIPI THOUGHT THAT </p><p>IT WAS A PLAY FOR TIME, AS JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA PROBABLY </p><p>HAD NOT GIVEN HIS DELEGATE A MANDATE TO JOIN THE </p><p>CONSENSUS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI MADE A STRONG PLEA FOR A SIX-MONTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06907  270831Z </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE MONUC MANDATE AND AN EARLY DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF THE UNITED NATIONS\' PEACEKEEPING BATTALION.  "WITHOUT </p><p>IT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE A DEAD LETTER," HE SUMMED UP. </p><p>HE HOPED THE USG WOULD SUPPORT THE HARARE EFFORT AT THE </p><p>WORLD BODY.  THE SIGNING OF THE DISENGAGEMENT PLAN </p><p>SHOULD BE SEEN AS A SIGN THAT THE DRC PLAYERS ARE </p><p>SERIOUS ABOUT A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, HE DECLARED.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT ZIMBABWE HAD BROUGHT HOME TWO BATTALIONS FROM </p><p>THE CONGO, WHICH IT DID NOT INTEND TO REPLACE.  THE </p><p>FIGHTING NEAR PWETO SHOULD NOT DETER MONUC DEPLOYMENT </p><p>BECAUSE MONUC COULD EASILY DEPLOY TO ANY OTHER AREA OF </p><p>THE FRONT, WHICH IS MOSTLY QUIET.  WHEN ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE REPORTED TAKING OF PWETO BY REBEL FORCES POSED A </p><p>THREAT TO THE AGREEMENT, HAMADZIRIPI STATED </p><p>CATEGORICALLY, "NO." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: HAMADZIRIPI, A RELIABLE CONTACT ON DRC </p><p>MATTERS, WAS UNUSUALLY KEEN ON RECEIVING US SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THIS LATEST DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO DISENTANGLE THE WARRING </p><p>PARTIES IN THE DRC.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO ADDRESSED </p><p>LOCAL DEFENSE ATTACHES ATTENDING THE SIGNING CEREMONY, </p><p>URGED THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO GET BEHIND THE DISENGAGEMENT </p><p>PLAN.  THIS EXTRAORDINARY DIPLOMATIC PLEADING COULD BE </p><p>AN INDICATION THAT THE DRC ALLIES ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>DESPERATE TO STOP THE FIGHTING BEFORE REBELS MAKE ANY </p><p>MORE ADVANCES.  ALTHOUGH ZIMBABWE MAY HAVE INTENDED TO </p><p>CONTINUE A GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL, RECENT ADVANCES BY THE </p><p>REBELS MAY FORCE THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES TO REDEPLOY </p><p>FORCES TO THE CONGO.  THE ALLIES COULD FEAR THAT THEY </p><p>ARE LOSING MOMENTUM TO THE REBELS, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT </p><p>OF REPORTS OF A HASTY RETREAT BY DRC ALLIES FROM PWETO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06907  270831Z </p><p>WITH HIS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES MOUNTING, MUGABE, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, CANNOT AFFORD AN INTENSIFIED WAR IN THE DRC </p><p>OR A MAJOR MILITARY REVERSAL. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
