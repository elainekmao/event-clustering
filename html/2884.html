<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000892 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>NSC FOR HARRY THOMAS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S ECONOMIC GROWTH:  ANOTHER CASUALTY OF THE </p><p>INSURGENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  The economy of Nepal, already one of the poorest </p><p>countries in the world, is in crisis, struggling under the </p><p>combined squeeze of escalating expenditures, primarily </p><p>related to the six-year-old Maoist insurgency, and plummeting </p><p>revenues.  Government development funds are already being </p><p>diverted to cover some of these costs.  Finance Ministry </p><p>officials expect the cash crunch to worsen in the coming </p><p>fiscal year, which begins July 15.  Absent an appreciable </p><p>improvement in the security situation, economic conditions </p><p>will continue to decline.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE POOR GET POORER </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world </p><p>with a per capita income of just over USD 240.  About 40 </p><p>percent of the population lives below the poverty line.  A </p><p>population growth rate of 2.4 percent has outpaced the </p><p>economy\'s ability to create jobs; underemployment is </p><p>estimated at nearly 50 percent.  While economic reforms since </p><p>1991 have helped maintain postive GDP growth, for the past </p><p>two years the growth rate has been lower than expected, </p><p>largely because of the depressed business climate and </p><p>off-budget government expenditures related to the Maoist </p><p>insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>FISCAL FEARS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The final quarter of the current fiscal year, </p><p>which ends July 15, is especially gloomy, complicated by </p><p>simultaneously skyrocketing expenditures and plunging </p><p>revenues.  Security expenditures alone, fueled by the </p><p>unforeseen cost of deploying the army under the state of </p><p>emergency declared in the second quarter, have already </p><p>surpassed the budgeted amount by at least 30 percent in the </p><p>current fiscal year, forcing the Government of Nepal (GON) to </p><p>introduce a supplemental budget in the upcoming session of </p><p>Parliament.  In the next year, defense spending may account </p><p>for as much as 25 percent of the budget (as compared to 14 </p><p>percent during the current year), according to Finance </p><p>Secretary Bimal Prasad Koirala.  While requests from the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>army, police, and Armed Police Force for big-ticket equipment </p><p>items, such as helicopters, may account for much of the jump, </p><p>training, recruitment (the Army alone plans a 10 percent hike </p><p>in recruitment), and deployment costs for the 50,000-man Army </p><p>have also eaten into the budget. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  At the same time that expenditures are mounting, </p><p>revenues are in a tailspin.  Nepal\'s FY 02 budget assumed a </p><p>20 percent increase in national revenue; growth, instead, has </p><p>been only a fifth of that.  Garments, Nepal\'s largest </p><p>manufactured export, are down by more than 50 percent for the </p><p>year, a drop prompted primarily by declining orders from the </p><p>U.S., which accounts for 85 percent of Nepal\'s garment </p><p>market.  Carpet exports, meanwhile, registered a 27 percent </p><p>decline compared with the previous year, while pashmina </p><p>shawls, Nepal\'s largest handicraft export, dipped by 70 </p><p>percent.  The deteriorating security situation has depressed </p><p>Nepal\'s generally lucrative tourism sector, which last year </p><p>accounted for more than 4 percent of GDP and contributed more </p><p>than 15 percent to Nepal\'s forex earnings.  In the month of </p><p>April alone, arrivals plummeted by 50 percent compared with </p><p>the previous year.  According to the Central Bureau of </p><p>Statistics, the hotel/tourism/restaurant industry this year </p><p>for the first time registered negative growth--a dismal -5 </p><p>percent.  Revisions to the bilateral trade treaty with India, </p><p>Nepal\'s largest trading partner, may further depress exports </p><p>by an additional 10 percent next year, Koirala predicted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Despite the decline in revenues, Finance Secretary </p><p>Koirala said he believes the GON "can manage" for the rest of </p><p>the FY.  He fears that may not be the case in the coming </p><p>fiscal year, when revenues may not cover regular </p><p>expenditures, and the GON may be unable to come up with the </p><p>20 percent needed in counterpart funding to keep many foreign </p><p>donor programs going.  He morosely confided to econoff that </p><p>his Ministry has "no idea" where it will find the funds </p><p>necessary to meet mounting expenditures for the next year. </p><p>Other Ministry sources estimate that the budget deficit, </p><p>which typically hovers between 5-6 percent, will jump to 10 </p><p>percent.  The GON will try to meet the shortfall through </p><p>internal borrowing--which is limited to 2 percent of GDP--and </p><p>through the munificence of foreign donors. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>GROWTH PROJECTIONS GLOOMY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Given the dismal outlook, the Ministry of Finance </p><p>has revised GDP growth projections for the current year from </p><p>6 percent to a more modest 2 percent--the slowest rate </p><p>registered since the restoration of democracy in 1992.  On </p><p>May 6, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) released </p><p>figures projecting even more somber numbers--0.76 </p><p>percent--the lowest growth rate in nearly 20 years.  Bad </p><p>weather kept growth in the agricultural sector, which </p><p>accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, to only 1.7 percent, </p><p>while non-agricultural growth registered a disappointing .15 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>DEVELOPMENT SUFFERS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The GON\'s budget woes are affecting implementation </p><p>of development projects, as funds targeted for development </p><p>are shifted to compensate for the 10 percent increase in </p><p>regular expenditures.  So far, however, the GON has managed </p><p>to keep up payment of critical counterpart funds for donors\' </p><p>projects by cutting its own development programs.  For </p><p>example, development funds allocated to Village Development </p><p>Councils have been cut by 50 percent this year, while those </p><p>for District Development Councils have shrunk by 25 percent. </p><p>Altogether 30 percent of the current year\'s development </p><p>budget will not be met, according to Finance Secretary </p><p>Koirala; in the upcoming fiscal year, there may be no </p><p>development resources at all for local bodies provided by the </p><p>GON.  The increasingly violent insurgency has, moreover, </p><p>exacted an additional toll, Koirala lamented.  Besides the </p><p>cut in the development budget, the GON must also find a way </p><p>to pay more than USD 104 million in unbudgeted repair costs </p><p>to infrastructure damaged in Maoist attacks over the past </p><p>five months. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While the GON may be legitimately criticized for </p><p>some fiscal imprudence in the past, the primary factors </p><p>undercutting economic performance this year--an unprecedented </p><p>state of emergency and military mobilization; fall-out from </p><p>September 11 on the tourism industry; a downturn in the </p><p>economies of Nepal\'s major export markets--were well beyond </p><p>both the control and the foresight of budget planners. </p><p>Unfortunately, absent an appreciable improvement in the </p><p>security situation, many of the factors aggravating the </p><p>current cash crunch are likely to get worse instead of better </p><p>in the near term.  We expect both the frequency and the </p><p>urgency of Nepal\'s pleas for assistance to the donor </p><p>community to increase in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
