Currently, Nigerian law </p><p>criminalizes only drug money laundering and proscribes select </p><p>forms of financial crimes in a piece-meal fashion.  The </p><p>Nigerian Penal Code criminalizes acts of violence, including </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) President Obasanjo recognizes the serious </p><p>deficiencies of Nigerian law in both addressing general money </p><p>laundering and, more specifically, the use of funds for </p><p>terrorism.  Reflecting the heightened concerns post-September </p><p>11, the President reportedly directed his staff in late </p><p>October to modify the draft Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) </p><p>Act to include terrorism and terrorism financing.  In </p><p>meetings with Ambassador Jeter, he has also made explicit </p><p>requests for technical assistance in upgrading Nigeria,s </p><p>anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws as well as </p><p>improving law enforcement efforts against these crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Since Post reported on the FCC Act revisions that </p><p>included terrorism (Ref B) ) done on the eve of President </p><p>Obasanjo,s November 2 visit to Washington ) the GON has </p><p>further refined the draft legislation to focus more on </p><p>terrorism financing.  The draft law now contains a definition </p><p>of terrorism: </p><p>QUOTE: (a) any act which is a violation of the Criminal Code </p><p>or the Penal Code and which may endanger the life, physical </p><p>integrity of freedom of, or cause serious injury or death to, </p><p>any person, any number or group of persons or causes or may </p><p>cause damage to public or private property, natural </p><p>resources, environmental or cultural heritage and is </p><p>calculated or intended to ) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(i)intimidate, put in fear, force, coerce or induce any </p><p>government, body, institution, the general public or any </p><p>segment thereof, to do or abstain from doing any act or to </p><p>adopt or abandon a particular standpoint, or to act according </p><p>to certain principles, or </p><p>(ii)  disrupt any public service, the delivery of any </p><p>essential service to the public or to create a public </p><p>emergency; or </p><p>(iii) create general insurrection in a State; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) any promotion, sponsorship of, contribution to, command, </p><p>aid, incitement, encouragement, attempt, threat, conspiracy, </p><p>organization or procurement of any person, with the intent to </p><p>commit any act referred to in paragraph (a) (i), (ii) and </p><p>(iii). </p><p>END QUOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) In a December 12 meeting with Ebenezer Obeya, Legal </p><p>Assistant to the National Security Advisor, RNLEO obtained a </p><p>copy of the newly revised draft law, entitled the </p><p>"Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>Act."  Obeya disclosed that the Attorney General,s office </p><p>and the Presidency have been holding consultations with key </p><p>members and committees of the National Assembly to build </p><p>support for the new law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) In a December 13 conversation with RNLEO, Attorney </p><p>General Bola Ige claimed that this new legislation would </p><p>supersede the existing 1995 Money Laundering Act and would be </p><p>passed by the National Assembly in the first quarter of 2002. </p><p> Ige had just returned from a trip to Rome where he attended </p><p>a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force,s (FATF) Africa </p><p>and Middle East Review Group.  The Attorney General and a </p><p>team of working level experts presented to the AMERG the </p><p>GON,s new efforts to improve Nigeria,s record on money </p><p>laundering in the wake of the FATF,s June declaration of </p><p>Nigeria as a "non-cooperative country or territory" on money </p><p>laundering controls.  Stating that the meeting went extremely </p><p>well, Ige confirmed that the new FCC bill was the centerpiece </p><p>of the GON,s presentation and he claimed that this drew a </p><p>good reaction from AMERG members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) The Attorney General made a point of expressing his </p><p>pleasure to discover, upon arrival at the Rome FATF meeting </p><p>that "the U.S. Government keeps its pledges" ) referring to </p><p>the presence and support at the meeting of a USG money </p><p>laundering expert who had participated in discussions of the </p><p>November 9 Bilateral Law Enforcement Committee meeting in </p><p>Washington.  During those discussions, the USG expert (INL or </p><p>Treasury) pledged USG support within the FATF for the steps </p><p>the GON was taking to improve its money laundering controls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
