<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WDAYTON </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ECON, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: SIMBA MAKONI ON PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 409 B) HARARE 433 C) HARARE 347 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Former Finance Minister Simba Makoni said the </p><p>recently-announced modest fuel hike and announcement of an </p><p>export support mechanism were supported by every ZANU-PF </p><p>politburo member except Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, </p><p>but the measures were unlikely to have much of an effect on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s imploding economy.  Makoni acknowledged ongoing </p><p>discussions within the ruling party about presidential </p><p>succession, but said these were unlikely to lead anywhere </p><p>until President Mugabe endorses them.  Asked whether it was </p><p>possible to forestall financial sanctions with a bilateral </p><p>dialogue, the Ambassador emphasized that ZANU-PF would have </p><p>to be prepared to address all issues of mutual concern, </p><p>including the legitimacy of the current Zimbabwean </p><p>government.  Since his dismissal as Finance Minister in 2002, </p><p>a growing number of ruling party insiders are convinced that </p><p>Makoni is the only individual capable of resolving Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>political and economic crises and ensuring ZANU-PF\'s </p><p>continued hold on power.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Recent economic measures </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On February 27, the Ambassador and polchief met with </p><p>former Finance Minister -- and serving member of the ZANU-PF </p><p>Politburo -- Simba Makoni in the business office he runs with </p><p>his wife.  Asked about the significance of recent economic </p><p>steps announced by the GOZ -- including the modest fuel price </p><p>hike and a new export support mechanism -- Makoni said the </p><p>increasing desperation of Zimbabwe\'s economic decline had </p><p>finally forced the Government\'s hand.  These steps were long </p><p>overdue but nothing new -- he had pressed for them while at </p><p>Finance.  Interestingly, he said virtually everyone in the </p><p>Politburo supported them this time, including previously </p><p>vociferous opponents such as Minister for Agriculture Joseph </p><p>Made.  The lone holdout, according to Makoni, had been chief </p><p>ZANU-PF propagandist Jonathan Moyo, but he had been </p><p>overruled.  Makoni feared that the recent steps were too </p><p>little too late and would have little impact on this </p><p>country\'s economic implosion.  The doubling of fuel prices, </p><p>for instance, would have little effect on fuel availability </p><p>-- it would simply reduce the GOZ\'s subsidy obligation by a </p><p>small percentage. </p><p> </p><p>Succession </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Makoni acknowledged that there are ongoing discreet </p><p>discussions among senior ZANU-PF insiders about presidential </p><p>succession, which seem to have more urgency than similar </p><p>conversations in the past.  This issue, however, remains very </p><p>much on the "side table" and those pushing it most actively </p><p>do not appear prepared yet to place it on the "main table." </p><p>Makoni dismissed recent speculation that some moderate ruling </p><p>party figures might form a third political party.  Most of </p><p>his ruling party colleagues, he claimed, accept the need for </p><p>a "broader political consensus." Makoni insisted, however, </p><p>that "with all due respect to the courage and conviction of </p><p>our MDC counterparts," political change in Zimbabwe would </p><p>emerge from within ZANU-PF.  That may be the case, the </p><p>Ambassador commented, but the longer the country\'s crises are </p><p>allowed to go on, the more likely it will be that Zimbabweans </p><p>simply will want ZANU-PF to go.  Makoni concurred with that </p><p>assessment.  The Ambassasor noted the slew of press reports </p><p>that two primary factions have formed within ZANU:  one led </p><p>by Speaker of Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is clearly </p><p>working to position himself as Mugabe\'s successor, and the </p><p>other one comprising those who oppose Mnangagwa but who </p><p>appear not to have settled on a single candidate.  Makoni </p><p>nodded but offered no comment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) According to Makoni, President Mugabe is ensuring </p><p>that, on succession, he can "have his cake and eat it, too." </p><p>Although the Zimbabwean president regularly insists that the </p><p>party must choose his successor, there is limited precedent </p><p>for this in ZANU-PF\'s history.  In the late 70\'s, when </p><p>Ndabaningi Sithole left the presidency of ZANU-PF, a small </p><p>group of party insiders met under a tree in Mozambique and </p><p>chose Mugabe as the successor, a decision that was </p><p>subsequently rubber-stamped by a party congress.  The lesson, </p><p>Makoni said, is that the party will not make active plans for </p><p>succession until Mugabe gives the go-ahead, a step he has not </p><p>yet taken.  Makoni said the ruling party\'s old guard actually </p><p>comprises a very small group:  Mugabe, Vice-Presidents </p><p>Muzenda and Msika, party chairman John Nkomo, Minister of </p><p>Defense Sydney Sekeramayi, politburo member and former </p><p>defense forces chief Solomon Mujuru, and Minister of Rural </p><p>Resources Joyce Mujuru.  Makoni described the latter four as </p><p>open-minded individuals who realize the depth of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>crises and the need to address them.  It is really the first </p><p>three, he said -- Mugabe, Muzenda, and Msika -- who form the </p><p>"crust keeping the rest of us down and that we need to break </p><p>through." </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-Zimbabwe relations </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Raising recent press reports of looming U.S. </p><p>financial sanctions on Zimbabwean leaders, Makoni asked </p><p>whether it was possible to forestall such a move by having "a </p><p>quiet conversation with us."  The Ambassador replied that he </p><p>is always willing to talk to anyone but cautioned that, for </p><p>any discussions to lead to improved bilateral relations </p><p>between the United States and Zimbabwe, there has to be a </p><p>willingness within ZANU to address all issues of mutual </p><p>concern, including the legitimacy of the Zimbabwean </p><p>government.  Makoni took the point but cautioned, without </p><p>elaboration, that progress was likelier if less contentious </p><p>issues were addressed first. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Among his senior ZANU-PF colleagues, Makoni is a </p><p>breath of fresh air.  He never feeds us his party\'s tired </p><p>rhetoric, but freely acknowledges the depth of the crises </p><p>facing Zimbabwe and has good ideas about how to resolve them. </p><p> As Finance Minister, his public candor about Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>challenges and the required solutions earned him a dismissal </p><p>from Cabinet and lingering distrust from party hardliners. </p><p>Since his departure from Government last fall, however, </p><p>Makoni has begun to gain popularity with many ZANU stalwarts </p><p>who see him as their only hope of maintaining the ruling </p><p>party\'s hold on power.  Even his public comments of last week </p><p>published in the independent "Daily News" that ZANU-PF must </p><p>talk to the MDC to resolve the country\'s crisis were </p><p>ground-breaking.  While acknowledging that succession is the </p><p>informal topic du jour among ZANU-PF insiders, Makoni </p><p>adroitly avoided addressing his own role in such discussions. </p><p> He seemed much more relaxed than the last time we saw him; </p><p>life in the private sector, where he and his wife run a </p><p>lingerie manufacturing/retail business, clearly agrees with </p><p>him. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
