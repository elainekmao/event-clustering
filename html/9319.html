<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 07-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETRD, EINV, CE, IZ, IN </p><p>SUBJECT:  Mission requests status of Iraqi Mission in </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1093 (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an Action Request.  Please see Para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  During a July 9 meeting with Charge, </p><p>MFA Acting Foreign Secretary (and former DCM at the Sri </p><p>Lankan Mission in Washington) JDA Wijewardena expressed </p><p>concern that the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) </p><p>in Baghdad was planning to close the Iraqi Mission in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  Wijewardena also provided a Charge with an </p><p>aide memoire outlining the GSL position, based on </p><p>economic and trade interests, that the Iraqi Mission </p><p>here not be closed.  Mission requests information on the </p><p>status of the Iraqi Mission in Sri Lanka.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) INCOMPLETE INFORMATION:  The MFA was not fully </p><p>informed re the closing of the Iraqi Mission.  When </p><p>queried on the specifics, Wijewardena could not reliably </p><p>attribute the information that the Mission would be </p><p>closed.  He thought that perhaps the Iraqi Mission </p><p>itself had mentioned something, but admitted the MFA had </p><p>not received any formal notification.  Charge responded </p><p>that our Embassy had not received anything specific from </p><p>Washington re the Iraqi Mission here.  The MFA knew that </p><p>the Iraqi Charge had been summoned back to Baghdad some </p><p>weeks ago, but, during the meeting, confirmed that the </p><p>Iraqi Charge had returned and was currently in Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) (Note:  As reported in Ref A, upon his return to </p><p>Sri Lanka, Iraqi Charge Wajdi Mardan Abbas told us on </p><p>June 20, that Ambassador Bremer mentioned plans to close </p><p>32 of the 64 current Iraqi missions.  Abbas did not </p><p>state whether the Iraqi Mission in Sri Lanka was one </p><p>designated for closure, instead he complianed that the </p><p>decision should be an "Iraqi Government" one.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ECONOMIC INTERESTS:  As detailed in the aide </p><p>memoire, Sri Lanka has maintained a long trade </p><p>relationship with Iraq.  Under the the UN\'s Oil for Food </p><p>program, Sri Lanka continued supplying significant </p><p>quantities of tea to the country.  The GSL is anxious </p><p>that this trade relationship be maintained and feels </p><p>that the presence of an Iraqi Mission in Colombo is </p><p>vital.  The full text of the aide memoire is provided </p><p>below. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>AIDE MEMOIR </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka and Iraq have over the years been maintaining </p><p>close and cordial relations.  In fact, Iraq was one of </p><p>the first Arab countries with which Sri Lanka </p><p>established Diplomatic relations.  Diplomatic relations </p><p>with Iraq was established in the late 50s and a Mission </p><p>to Baghdad was established in 1962 with concurrent </p><p>accreditation from Karachi, the then capital of </p><p>Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>The relations between the two countries were further </p><p>consolidated within the Non-Alignment Movement and the </p><p>Group of 77. </p><p> </p><p>Even after the Gulf war in 1991, Sri Lanka was one of </p><p>the few countries that continued to maintain its Embassy </p><p>at ambassadorial level throughout the critical period </p><p>and thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq has been a very important trading partner for Sri </p><p>Lanka as tea which is on eof our main export commodities </p><p>has been holding a market share of around 70% in the </p><p>Iraqi market.  The annual average tea export to pre-Gulf </p><p>war, Iraq has been around 30,000 Metric Tons.  (Please </p><p>see Table 1). </p><p> </p><p>After the Gulf war, under the UN Oil For Food Programme, </p><p>we have been exporting around 12,000 Metric Tons offer </p><p>which is about 20% of the Iraqi requirements.  Sri Lanka </p><p>had also in the pre-Gulf war period purchased from time </p><p>to time, oil at concessionary rates.  Besides Tea, </p><p>commodities such as natural rubber, rubber based </p><p>products--particularly tyres-are products that could be </p><p>exported to Iraq.  The trade balance with Iraq has </p><p>continuously been in favour of Sri Lanka except a 4 year </p><p>period immediately after 1991 war.  (Table 2). </p><p> </p><p>As Iraq has traditionally been a main buyer of Sri Lanka </p><p>tea, and as the Iraq consumer has cultivated a taste for </p><p>black orthodox tea from Sri Lanka, it is envisaged that </p><p>Sri Lanka could work towards increasing tea exports to a </p><p>substantial amount. </p><p>The re-construction of Iraq offers a vast potential in </p><p>the area of the construction industry.  Over the last </p><p>decade the number of Sri Lankan expatriates in Iraq was </p><p>marginal.  However, given our expertise in the areas of </p><p>skilled and unskilled labour in the Arab world it is </p><p>envisaged that Sri Lanka could look for opportunities </p><p>for employment for Sri Lankan labour in Iraq once the </p><p>re-construction activities are in place. </p><p> </p><p>Given the Sri Lankan experience in nation building </p><p>amidst a conflict situation, the Sri Lanka Government </p><p>could also enter into collaborative arrangements with </p><p>Iraq on identified projects. </p><p> </p><p>It is therefore important that the Iraqi Mission be </p><p>maintained in Colombo so that links especially in the </p><p>areas of trade and economic cooperation would be </p><p>strengthened for the mutual benefit of the two </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>(Dated July 9, 2003) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>END TEXT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests that </p><p>Washington provide a status update as to the Iraqi </p><p>Mission in Sri Lanka.  The GSL is concerned that the </p><p>Mission will be closed, to the detriment of a long- </p><p>standing Sri Lankan trade relationship with Iraq and </p><p>Post would like to be responsive in addressing the GSL\'s </p><p>request for information.  END REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
