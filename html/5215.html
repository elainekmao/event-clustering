Qirbi has received a </p><p>letter from the Ministry of Defense outlining outstanding </p><p>North Korean military shipments and plans to respond to </p><p>Ambassador\'s letter this week.  Qirbi also commented on the </p><p>counter-terrorism component of his recent trips to Sudan and </p><p>Tanzania.  The Embassy reiterated concern over problems </p><p>plaguing the receipt of the diplomatic pouch, informed Qirbi </p><p>of the ongoing USAID visit, and expressed approval of Yemeni </p><p>LNOs for CJTF/HOA.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Scuds </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Ambassador Hull\'s January 19th meeting with Minister </p><p>Qirbi was also attended by DCM, AdminOff, PolOff (notetaker), </p><p>and Minister Qirbi\'s Advisor Iryani. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  The Ambassador reviewed his recent meeting with </p><p>Defense Minister Aliwa, who stated that a North Korean team </p><p>will travel to Yemen to help with scud installation.  In </p><p>addition, spare parts for artillery and radar have been </p><p>ordered from North Korea.  Aliwa also said the Defense </p><p>Ministry provided input for a letter for Minister Qirbi\'s </p><p>signature detailing these outstanding arrangements and </p><p>expressing ROYG\'s commitment that no further SCUDs or other </p><p>military material were on order or in transit from North </p><p>Korea. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Minister Qirbi confirmed that said MOD information </p><p>has arrived in his office, and said he expected to </p><p>incorporate the information into a response to the </p><p>Ambassador\'s letter within the coming week. Qirbi\'s response </p><p>letter arrived at the Embassy on January 20th. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Diplomatic Pouch </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  The Ambassador reiterated concern over continued </p><p>problems with diplomatic pouches.  Qirbi said large shipments </p><p>-- i.e. as many as 10 pouches at once -- would be problematic </p><p>until he discussed pouch guidelines and reached a final </p><p>understanding with PSO Chief Gamesh.  Qirbi stated that he </p><p>would sit down with Gamesh (upon Gamesh\'s return from the </p><p>U.S.) and seek final ROYG consensus on pouch guidelines.  DCM </p><p>noted recent pouch shipment represented first successful </p><p>"bellyload" of pouches and praised Yemen side for this </p><p>positive step. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>USAID and Potential Development Projects </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on the ongoing USAID </p><p>visit in preparation for the re-establishment of an AID </p><p>office in Yemen.  He noted that the USG is working on a </p><p>strategy and identifying suitable funding sources for further </p><p>development assistance to Yemen.  Qirbi confirmed he is </p><p>sending a letter to Secretary Powell regarding Yemen\'s </p><p>participation in the Middle East Partnership Initiative and </p><p>the Millenium Challenge Account. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Counter-Terrorism </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  Minister Qirbi described his recent trip to Sudan </p><p>and Tanzania as a meeting with friends of the anti-terror </p><p>campaign.  When asked about the Sudanese and Tanzanian </p><p>response to this campaign, Qirbi said that it was very </p><p>positive, and added that everyone was aware of the importance </p><p>of cooperation.  Qirbi volunteered that the Sudanese feel the </p><p>U.S. is not as impartial as it should be especially in light </p><p>of its involvement in southern Sudan.  Qirbi stated that the </p><p>Sudanese have reached this conclusion based on U.S. </p><p>legislation penalizing the Sudanese government for its </p><p>activities in the south. </p><p>9.  (S)  The Ambassador noted that practical cooperation </p><p>between Yemen and the U.S. on anti-terrorism was going well </p><p>and referred to meetings between Yemeni Ambassador to the </p><p>U.S. al-Hajjri and A/S Burns and S/CT Coordinator Black. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Military Cooperation </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  The Ambassador expressed approval with recent </p><p>developments on the military cooperation front, including the </p><p>Minister of Defense\'s selection of liaison officers for the </p><p>USS Mt. Whitney, as a practical step. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
