<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, EAID, PREF, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S PRIME MINISTER SEEKS TO LOWER POLITICAL </p><p>TEMPERATURE WITH PROTESTING POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a June 29 meeting with the Ambassador, Prime </p><p>Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa said he wants to "lower the </p><p>political temperature" with the protesting political parties. </p><p> He hopes to bring representatives of the parties into the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) negotiating team.  His efforts so </p><p>far have met with some success in re-establishing good </p><p>relations, especially among the second-tier leadership. </p><p>Thapa reconfirmed that the GON has not changed its policy </p><p>toward Tibetan asylum seekers and appealed for international </p><p>pressure on Bhutan to keep to its commitments to repatriate </p><p>refugees in Nepal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THAPA TALKING TO PARTIES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Accompanied by DCM Robert Boggs and AID Mission </p><p>Director Donald Clark, the Ambassador called on Prime </p><p>Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa on June 29.  The Ambassador </p><p>congratulated Thapa on his June 11 appointment and emphasized </p><p>that the USG was pleased by his pledge to broaden the </p><p>government and hold early elections. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Prime Minister said his government faces two </p><p>primary challenges:  advancing the peace process and reaching </p><p>an understanding with the political parties.  He reported </p><p>that he had been holding extensive discussions with party </p><p>leaders, adding that he was meeting Communist Party of Nepal </p><p>- United Marxist Leninist (UML) General Secretary Madhav </p><p>Nepal that same day and Nepali Congress Party President G.P. </p><p>Koirala the following day.  In addition, he is also holding </p><p>discussions with second-tier party leaders, who had offered </p><p>some encouraging reactions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The political leaders realize that their street </p><p>agitation against the Government of Nepal (GON) is having no </p><p>effect, Thapa stressed, and may thus be increasingly ready to </p><p>consider compromise.  To encourage a more conducive </p><p>environment, Thapa said his own policy so far has been to </p><p>"lower the political temperature" by withholding criticism of </p><p>the parties in the state-owned press and by urging the police </p><p>to adopt a more restrained approach in dealing with the </p><p>street protests.  Agitation is a democratic right as long as </p><p>the protests remain peaceful, he emphasized.  Thapa said his </p><p>efforts to change the politically charged, embittered </p><p>atmosphere have had some effect at the working levels of the </p><p>parties, adding that some second-rung leaders had confided to </p><p>him that they saw no rationale to the protracted and largely </p><p>unpopular program of street protests.  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that he appreciated the PM\'s attempts to broaden </p><p>his government, adding that the cooperation of the political </p><p>parties is essential to holding timely elections. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>US ASSISTANCE IMPORTANT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Thapa said that he deeply appreciates US development </p><p>cooperation and expressed gratitude for US security </p><p>assistance.  In his view, there are three essential </p><p>components to a successful GON effort to counter the </p><p>insurgency.  First, the security forces need more and better </p><p>training and equipment.  Second, well-coordinated </p><p>international support is crucial.  The third critical element </p><p>is securing support from the political parties.  He </p><p>emphasized that he has kept the GON talk team purposely small </p><p>in order to leave room for the political parties to join. </p><p>The peace talks are only the first step, Thapa indicated. </p><p>Should a political settlement be reached, substantial </p><p>international support will also be needed to fund </p><p>rehabilitation and reintegration of former Maoists.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that he was encouraged to learn of Thapa\'s </p><p>efforts to form a more representative negotiating team and </p><p>reiterated USG interest in seeing the peace process move </p><p>forward. </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>TIBETAN POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador stressed USG concern at the May 31 </p><p>deportations of 18 Tibetans from Nepal.  He urged the PM to </p><p>commit to restoring the GON\'s previous policy of allowing </p><p>UNHCR to process transiting Tibetans for onward travel to </p><p>India.  He also raised the problem faced by long-time </p><p>resident Tibetan parents in Nepal who are unable to secure </p><p>proper identification and travel documents for their </p><p>children.  Many such parents who have been accepted for </p><p>immigration to the US remain unable to take their </p><p>undocumented children--most of whom may have been born in </p><p>Nepal--with them.  The PM reconfirmed that GON policy toward </p><p>Tibetan asylum seekers has not changed, and stated that in </p><p>the future transiting Tibetans will be handed over, as </p><p>before, to UNHCR.  He committed to doing "everything I can" </p><p>to reassure the US on this point, noting that he plans to </p><p>send Nepal\'s UN PermRep to Washington to meet with concerned </p><p>leaders in Congress.  He added that he plans to reply soon to </p><p>a June 19 letter on the subject from nine US Conmgressmen. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BHUTANESE REFUGEES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador raised plans for repatriation of the </p><p>first tranche of Bhutanese refugees.  At the last </p><p>ministerial, the Bhutanese had showed "evidence of a good </p><p>approach" toward repatriation, Thapa said.  Constant </p><p>vigilance will be needed, however, including by members of </p><p>the international community, to ensure that Bhutan follows </p><p>through in implementing the agreement.  Thapa acquiesced in </p><p>the Ambassador\'s observation on the importance of including </p><p>UNHCR in the process, but added that "Bhutan has a fear </p><p>complex" about the organization. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Thapa\'s patient optimism that he will be able to </p><p>bring the political parties into his government is </p><p>reassuring--especially given the lack of success evident in </p><p>this endeavor thus far.  Several observers within political </p><p>and diplomatic circles, however, have expresed confidence </p><p>that the politically savvy, battle-hardened Thapa will be </p><p>able to pull it off, given enough time.  We agree that the </p><p>parties\' sustained protests have failed to garner them much </p><p>public sympathy--and increasingly, even much attention in the </p><p>press.  Whether or not the party leaders prove as savvy as </p><p>Thapa is reputed to be and abandon their futile "joint stir" </p><p>to join his Cabinet remains to be seen. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
