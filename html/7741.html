<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002812 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, CY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY/CYPRUS: TURKS ENCOURAGED BY FREE FLOW OF </p><p>PEOPLE ON ISLAND BUT WORRIED GREEK CYPRIOTS TRYING TO </p><p>UNDERMINE UNFICYP </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish MFA is encouraged by the flow of </p><p>people between the two sides on Cyprus and plans to open </p><p>additional gates.  Nevertheless, MFA is concerned that the </p><p>Greek Cypriots are attempting to restrict UNFICYP\'s important </p><p>role in the buffer zone, which would undermine the current </p><p>positive atmosphere on the island.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Cyprus DG Ertugrul Apakan summoned US and UK reps </p><p>to discuss the flow of people between the two sides.  Apakan </p><p>averred that Turkey views positively the large numbers of </p><p>people who have traveled to the north and south.  Noting that </p><p>there has been only one security incident thus far, Apakan </p><p>explained that according to Turkish figures since April 23, </p><p>107,125 Greek Cypriots and 29,613 Turkish Cypriots have </p><p>crossed to the other side.  Turkey wants to maintain the </p><p>current positive atmosphere on Cyprus and has no intention to </p><p>rescind allowing passage between the two sides, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Apakan noted that Turkish Cypriot authorities are now </p><p>allowing tourists to stay in the north for three days and </p><p>plan to open a total of four gates on the Turkish Cypriot </p><p>side.  In response to DCM\'s query on where Turkish policies </p><p>will lead, Apakan replied that Turkey wants to remove </p><p>barriers to a lasting, negotiated solution.  Apakan cited </p><p>what he said was F.M. Gul\'s recent statement in Brussels that </p><p>Turkey "wants to bridge gaps and differences based on the </p><p>Annan Plan" but stopped short of embracing the UNSYG\'s plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nevertheless, Apakan noted, there are unsubstantiated </p><p>reports that some groups are trying to create provocations </p><p>that could spoil the current environment.  Apakan claimed </p><p>that unions are attempting to organize potentially </p><p>destabilizing demonstrations on May 1 and that Greek Cypriot </p><p>motorcyclists may plan some unspecified "unhelpful" action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Even more troubling to Turkey, Apakan explained, is an </p><p>apparent statement by the Greek Cypriot Interior Minister </p><p>calling for UNFICYP to cease its role in regulating the </p><p>buffer zones between border gates.  Apakan explained that </p><p>although they do not perform any inspections themselves, UN </p><p>peacekeepers in the buffer zone play a vital role in </p><p>facilitating the free passage of Greek and Turkish Cypriots </p><p>between sides -- a role, he said, which is within the </p><p>existing UNFICYP mandate.  Apakan repeatedly stressed that </p><p>GOT wants UNFICYP to stay and maintain its current functions. </p><p> He further noted that Turkish missions abroad will be </p><p>contacting USG, UN, and UK officials to convey Turkish </p><p>sensitivities.  We indicated that the U.S. would continue to </p><p>support UNFICYP fulfilling its mandate and promised to inform </p><p>the Dept and USUN of Turkey\'s concerns. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
