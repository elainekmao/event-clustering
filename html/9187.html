<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, HR, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MESIC AND FM PICULA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR FRANK FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON JULY 2 AMBASSADOR FRANK TOLD PRESIDENT MESIC AND FM </p><p>PICULA THAT THE U.S. WOULD WORK WITH THE GOC TO PROMOTE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, REFORMS OF THE ECONOMY, AND CROATIAN </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN NATO AND THE EU.  HE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOC </p><p>MUST COOPERATE WITH THE ICTY AND WORK TO RESOLVE RETURNS </p><p>    ISSUES.  AMBASSADOR FRANK SUGGESTED THAT THE GOC COULD DO </p><p>MORE TO IMPROVE COORDINATION ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE GWOT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH FM PICULA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING AN INTRODUCTORY CALL ON JULY 2, AMBASSADOR </p><p>FRANK AND FM PICULA EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THE STATE OF </p><p>U.S.-CROATIA RELATIONS.  PICULA REVIEWED THE FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAD </p><p>REMAINED REMARKABLY STABLE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE </p><p>COALITION\'S AGENDA WAS AMBITIOUS AND BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMIC SECTOR.  PICULA EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO CROATIA OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND NATO.  HE </p><p>WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U.S. AND CROATIA WOULD CONTINUE THEIR </p><p>CLOSE COOPERATION, BUILDING ON PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  U.S. </p><p>AND EU SUPPORT TO ACHIEVING CROATIA\'S FOREIGN POLICY GOALS </p><p>WAS ESSENTIAL.  PICULA SAID THAT RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WAS CRUCIAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMBASSADOR FRANK NOTED CROATIA\'S MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS </p><p>AND AGREED THAT THERE WAS MORE YET TO BE DONE.  IN THIS </p><p>REGARD, THE U.S. FULLY SUPPORTED THE GOC\'S ASPIRATIONS FOR EU </p><p>AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  THE U.S. CERTAINLY WAS NOT ASKING </p><p>CROATIA TO CHOOSE BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>GOC MUST COMPLY WITH THE ICTY, ACCOMMODATE ALL RETURNEES, </p><p>NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, REFORM THE </p><p>JUDICIAL SECTOR AND CONTINUE BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY. </p><p>WHILE CROATIA HAD BEEN HELPFUL IN THE GWOT, IT COULD DO MORE. </p><p> AS AN INDICATION OF OUR COMMITMENT, THE U.S. HAD TO DATE </p><p>    PROVIDED $285 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO CROATIA.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>FRANK EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING PRIVATE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS TO DISCUSS POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PICULA SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINTS </p><p>WITHIN THE CABINET, ESPECIALLY ON CLOSER COOPERATION IN THE </p><p>GWOT.  HE ALSO PLEDGED THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE DIVISIVE </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES IN THE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MESIC </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS ON JULY 2, </p><p>AMBASSADOR FRANK MET PRIVATELY WITH PRESIDENT MESIC AND TWO </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS.  THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE SAME ISSUES WITH </p><p>MESIC WHO SAID HE WOULD "FIX" THE SHORTCOMINGS IN GWOT </p><p>COOPERATION.  HE ALSO PLEDGED TO WORK PRIVATELY WITH THE U.S. </p><p>TO RESOLVE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT BOTH PICULA AND MESIC TOOK A </p><p>VERY POSITIVE TONE IN THESE MEETINGS AND HAVE CLEARLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE SHORTCOMINGS OF DEALING WITH THE USG IN THE </p><p>PRESS RATHER THAN USING PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S.  WE </p><p>PLAN TO TEST THESE COMMITMENTS IN COMING WEEKS WITH BOTH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
