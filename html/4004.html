(S) IRAQ WAS THE MAJOR SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION AT A WORKING </p><p>LUNCH IN MOSCOW BETWEEN ITALIAN PM BERLUSCONI AND RUSSIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT PUTIN ON OCTOBER 16.  THE TWO LEADERS AGREED ON THE </p><p>NEED FOR A STRONG UNSC RESOLUTION THAT WOULD SEND INSPECTORS </p><p>BACK TO IRAQ SOON WITH A STRONG MANDATE TO GO "ANYWHERE, </p><p>ANYTIME."  PUTIN, HOWEVER, SAID THERE WERE TWO RED LINES HE </p><p>COULD NOT CROSS:  AN AUTOMATIC TRIGGER FOR THE USE OF FORCE, </p><p>AND UNILATERAL ACTION BY THE U.S. WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SANCTION.  PUTIN PRESSED HOME TO BERLUSCONI THE POINT THAT </p><p>HIS PROBLEMS WITH CHECHNYA AND GEORGIA SHOULD BE EQUATED WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S PROBLEMS WITH IRAQ, AND IF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY ACCEPTED U.S. ACTION AGAINST IRAQ IT SHOULD ALSO </p><p>ACCEPT RUSSIAN ACTION AGAINST CHECHNYA "TERRORISTS."  ON </p><p>OTHER ISSUES, PUTIN CLAIMED THAT RUSSIAN AID TO IRAN\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR PROGRAM WAS SOLELY FOR NON-MILITARY PROGRAMS, AND </p><p>TOLD BERLUSCONI HE WOULD NOT ATTEND THE NATO SUMMIT IN </p><p>PRAGUE.

THE PRESS, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, HAD REPORTED THAT BERLUSCONI NO LONGER </p><p>BELIEVED IRAQ HAD ANY WMD, PERIOD.  CASTELLANETA DESCRIBED </p><p>THE MEDIA REPORTS AS A HUGE "MISUNDERSTANDING."
