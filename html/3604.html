<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT, AF/RA FOR </p><p>SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZDERA; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   The December 31 edition of the government- </p><p>   controlled daily "Chronicle" characterized the signing </p><p>   of the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act </p><p>   (ZDERA) of 2001 by President George Bush as "an open </p><p>   declaration of war."  Under headline "A declaration of </p><p>   war," the paper comments: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The signing of the ZDERA by U.S. President, </p><p>   George W. Bush is an open declaration of war.  The </p><p>   protagonists are the Bush administration on the one </p><p>   hand and the ZANU PF government on the other.  The </p><p>   \'grass\' which usually suffers are Zimbabweans as </p><p>   Americans are too far away from the \'front.\'  War- </p><p>   monger Bush has made many mistakes barely 100 days into </p><p>   office, but affixing his signature to the Sanctions </p><p>   Bill, crafted by racist pro-Rhodesians in the U.S. </p><p>   Senate, is his worst and most unforgivable.  He has </p><p>   shown Zimbabweans what to expect from the trigger-happy </p><p>   White House in the days to come.  There is no doubt in </p><p>   our minds that the Sanctions Bill is meant to cow the </p><p>   government and ruling party into submission.  It is </p><p>   meant to bring the government down so that a puppet, </p><p>   who will dance to the Bush tune, will be installed. </p><p>   The message to Bush and those misguided senators still </p><p>   swimming in bigotry is - we will not be a banana </p><p>   republic.  The Zimbabwe government. . .will not cringe. </p><p>   Zimbabweans cannot be intimidate.  We now know the </p><p>   enemy and we are more than prepared to hit them hard, </p><p>   make no mistake about that." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
