<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, CA/OCS, AND DS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2004 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CASC, EINV, ASEC, ODIP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA OFFICIAL DISCUSSES GILMAN SHOOTING, MELFORT </p><p>DETENTION, AND EXPROPRIATION OF AMCIT PROPERTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 2487 B) HARARE 2529 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c) Summary.  The Ambassador and DCM met with MFA </p><p>Division Director for Europe and the Americas, Joey Bihma, </p><p>and acting desk officer Henry Mukonoweshuro on November 20 at </p><p>Bihma\'s invitation.  A cordial, almost conciliatory, Bihma </p><p>stated that he wished to address the shooting by police of </p><p>Richard Gilman in Mutare and the detention of two Embassy </p><p>staff by war vets on farm near Melfort (ref b).  On the </p><p>Gilman incident, Bihma handed over a more thorough police </p><p>report, as requested by the Ambassador in an earlier meeting </p><p>with Fonmin Mudenge (ref a).  On the Melfort episode, Bihma </p><p>pointed out that the MFA would find it easier to protect </p><p>traveling American diplomats if the Ministry were informed in </p><p>advance of their movements and destinations, to which the </p><p>Ambassador was non-committal.  The Ambassador also raised two </p><p>de facto expropriations of properties owned by American </p><p>citizens and explained that this could become a factor in the </p><p>annual selection of the list of countries that may benefit </p><p>from the General Schedule of Preferences (GSP).  Bihma </p><p>expressed optimism that this issue could be resolved. </p><p>Negative commentary in the GOZ press following the release of </p><p>an Embassy statement on the Melfort incident has continued </p><p>through November 21, but Bihma\'s buttery comportment leads us </p><p>to believe that the GOZ is still reluctant to tackle us in </p><p>person head on.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The Gilman Shooting </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu) Bihma had very little to say on the shooting of </p><p>Richard Gilman, other than to note that both sides had agreed </p><p>on the need for a thorough investigation.  He noted that the </p><p>MFA had requested the police to do this, and that the ZRP had </p><p>completed and submitted the report on November 19.  He passed </p><p>a copy of the report to the Ambassador, who acknowledged our </p><p>satisfaction that the GOZ had respected our requests for </p><p>access to the vehicle in which Mr. Gilman was killed and the </p><p>presence of a medical representative of the Gilman family </p><p>present during the autopsy.  The report, which was not all </p><p>that thorough, has been transmitted septel.  We will relay </p><p>our views to the GOZ on the report, and the use of lethal </p><p>force over a question of documentation, in a note verbale. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Melfort Detention </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu) Bihma said that Fonmin Mudenge had asked him to </p><p>point out that the MFA had in the past circulated a memo </p><p>advising diplomats to inform the MFA in advance of travel, </p><p>supplying information on timing and destination.  Bihma </p><p>hastened to add that this was for purposes of notification, </p><p>not asking permission.  It would allow the MFA to inform </p><p>local security officials to ensure the safety of traveling </p><p>diplomats, and would be a proper and helpful gesture.  Bihma </p><p>said that such notice would not be necessary for recreational </p><p>visits, only normal official business.  The Ambassador asked </p><p>if there had been any progress on our request that personal </p><p>belongings and documents taken from USG employees be promptly </p><p>returned.  Bihma replied that there was no report on this </p><p>yet.  The Ambassador stressed that the incident remained of </p><p>great concern to us.  Although we had managed to contact an </p><p>MFA and police officials when we were informed of the </p><p>detention, we had a hard time getting the MFA secretariat to </p><p>accept our note verbale on the incident during Ministry </p><p>working hours.  We were also unwilling to lodge a complaint </p><p>with police near Melfort, who were acting as if this were a </p><p>routine police matter when it was, in fact, a political and </p><p>diplomatic incident.  Bihma agreed that matters affecting </p><p>diplomats were to be handled by the MFA and said that the MFA </p><p>would be sure that we were in possession of a valid telephone </p><p>contact number for the Ministry\'s duty officer.  DCM rejoined </p><p>that this mechanism had not proven particularly reliable in </p><p>the past. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Expropriation of Amcit Property </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu) The Ambassador took the occasion to raise two </p><p>documented expropriations of Amcit properties, a ranch and a </p><p>farm.  Both had received two or more of the Section 5, 7, and </p><p>8 notices under the land reform legislation, and the Amcit </p><p>owners had been dispossessed of their properties.  In one </p><p>other case, the expropriation mechanism was underway although </p><p>the amcits in questions retained control of their respective </p><p>properties.  The Ambassador said that we had at various </p><p>points delivered notes verbale on these cases -- he passed </p><p>copies to Bihma -- but since June de facto expropriation had </p><p>occurred nonetheless.  The Americans in question had </p><p>exhausted legal remedies.  The Ambassador noted that under </p><p>both international and U.S. regulations, the respect for </p><p>property rights, or prompt and fair compensation, are the </p><p>norm. He continued that the U.S. legislative schedule will </p><p>soon begin its annual review of GSP beneficiaries, which </p><p>receive preferential access to U.S. markets in the form of </p><p>lowered duty.  Last year, Zimbabwe had benefited from this </p><p>program to the tune of USD 26 million.  One aspect of this </p><p>qualifying for this program, however, is whether property </p><p>owned by U.S. citizens has been expropriated. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c) Bihma said that he had been unaware of the listing of </p><p>the properties in question.  There had been a Cabinet </p><p>decision to delist properties owned by foreign investors.  In </p><p>the event that overriding national interests were at stake, </p><p>the owners must be compensated fully for the property.  He </p><p>said that the current financial situation made such </p><p>compensation impossible, and thus delisting is the norm.  He </p><p>offered to look into the issue and return to us with a more </p><p>definitive response. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c) Bihma had clearly received instructions to break no </p><p>eggs in his dealings with us.  Following the release of the </p><p>Embassy\'s strongly worded November 19 press statement on the </p><p>Melfort incident, Information Minister Jonathan Moyo engaged </p><p>in his usual braying performance in the GOZ written press, </p><p>and on November 21 the GOZ Herald ran an article claiming </p><p>that U.S. diplomats were under order to give 48 hour </p><p>notification for travel outside of Harare, a statement that </p><p>directly contradicts what Bihma stated.  The article further </p><p>claims that the Ambassador was apologetic -- he was not -- </p><p>and characterized our press statement on the Melfort as </p><p>"undiplomatic and defamatory."  Whatever the GOZ propaganda </p><p>machine may churn out, face to face Bihma and his handlers </p><p>appear unwilling to take us head on.  We have implemented new </p><p>measures to minimize the risk of Melfort incidents in our </p><p>travel into the field, but we have no intention of abandoning </p><p>these missions.  We also do not intend to provide the MFA </p><p>forty-eight hour notice -- only the British have been ordered </p><p>to do so -- unless expressly told to do so in writing.  At </p><p>that moment, we will request reciprocal treatment of </p><p>Zimbabwean officials posted in Washington and New York. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
