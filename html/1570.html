<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000566 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, ASEAN, ARF </p><p>SUBJECT:  TREATY OF AMITY AND COOPERATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA: VIETNAM PRESSES FOR ARF MEMBER ACCESSION </p><p> </p><p>1.   ON FEBRUARY 6 MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT CALLED IN LOCAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF ARF MEMBER-COUNTRIES FOR A BRIEFING ON </p><p>THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE TREATY OF AMITY AND COOPERATION </p><p>(TAC) IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>PHAM HUU CHI PRESIDED; REPRESENTATIVES FROM CANADA, CHINA, </p><p>DPRK, INDIA, JAPAN, MONGOLIA, NEW ZEALAND, ROK, RUSSIA, AND </p><p>THE U.S. (POLOFF) ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00566  01 OF 02  091019Z </p><p>2.   CHI STARTED BY NOTING THAT THE SECOND PROTOCOL TO THE </p><p>TAC, SIGNED BY ASEAN FOREIGN LMINSTERS AT THE 31ST ASEAN </p><p>MINISTERIAL MEETING IN JULY 1998, HAS NOW COME INTO EFFECT </p><p>WITH ASEAN\'S RECEIPT OF INSTRUMENTS OF RATIFICATION FROM </p><p>PAPUA NEW GUINEA LATE LAST YEAR.  ASEAN VERY MUCH HOPES THAT </p><p>DIALOGUE PARTNERS, ARF MEMBERS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES </p><p>WILL ACCEDE TO THE SECOND PROTOCOL.  ALTHOUGH THAILAND IN </p><p>ITS THEN-CAPACITY AS ASEAN CHAIR REITERATED THIS INVITATION </p><p>IN MAY 2000, UP TO THIS POINT ASEAN HAS PRELIMINARY </p><p>RESPONSES FROM ONLY THREE COUNTRIES: JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES.  CHI DECLINED TO DESCRIBE THESE </p><p>RESPONSES. </p><p> </p><p>3.   CHI CONTINUED THAT ASEAN HAS RECEIVED INQUIRIES FROM A </p><p>NUMBER OF OTHER STATES, AND SUMMARIZED ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS </p><p>ON TWO MAIN ISSUES AS FOLLOWS.  (NOTE:  THESE DETAILS DIFFER </p><p>VERY LITTLE FROM THOSE IN THE MAY 2000 THAI LETTER.) </p><p> </p><p>     -- RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CONTRACTING PARTIES:  UPON </p><p>ACCESSION, NON-SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES WOULD BECOME "HIGH </p><p>CONTRACTING PARTIES" TO THE TAC, WITH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME </p><p>RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS SOUTHEAST ASEAN STATES.  THE </p><p>EXCEPTIONS WOULD BE THAT NON-SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES WOULD </p><p>NOT HAVE THE RIGHT OF CONSENT TO NEW ACCESSIONS BY OTHER NON- </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES, AND WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>HIGH COUNCIL UNLESS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN A DISPUTE THE </p><p>COUNCIL WAS ASKED TO CONSIDER.  NON-SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES </p><p>COULD, HOWEVER, ASK TO BE OBSERVERS OF HIGH COUNCIL </p><p>PROCEEDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>     -- FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH COUNCIL:  CHI SAID ASEAN IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00566  01 OF 02  091019Z </p><p>STILL FINALIZING THE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE HIGH </p><p>COUNCIL, BUT IS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND HAS AN AGREED </p><p>DRAFT.  ASEAN HOPES THE RULES OF PROCEDURE CAN BE ADOPTED AT </p><p>THE JULY AMM IN HANOI, AFTER WHICH TIME ASEAN CAN GIVE MORE </p><p>DETAILED ANSWERS TO QUERIES ON THIS BODY. </p><p> </p><p>4.   CHI REITERATED ASEAN\'S HOPE FOR PROGRESS ON TAC </p><p>ACCESSION SOON, AND ASKED ATTENDEES TO RELAY THIS DESIRE TO </p><p>THEIR CAPITALS AND SEEK FEEDBACK.  ASEAN HOPES FOR RESPONSES </p><p>BEFORE THE MAY ARF SOM OR, FAILING THAT, THE JULY </p><p>MINISTERIAL.  CHI ALSO ASKED FOR IMMEDIATE VIEWS OF </p><p>ATTENDEES PRESENT.  SELECTED REPRESENTATIVES PROVIDED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING REMARKS: </p><p> </p><p>     -- NEW ZEALAND IS STILL AWAITING ASEAN\'S RESPONSE ON </p><p>THREE ISSUES:  CLARIFICATION OF "NON-INTERFERENCE" IN </p><p>ARTICLE 2C; CLARIFICATION OF "THREAT TO POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC STABILITY IN ARTICLE 10; AND CLARIFICATION ON </p><p>CONTRACTING PARTIES\' RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE </p><p>THE HIGH COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>     -- SWEDEN, AS THE CURRENT INCUMBENT OF THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, BELIEVES THE TAC IS VALUABLE AND ALL PARTIES </p><p>HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONSIDER IT SERIOUSLY.  THE EU IS </p><p>STILL STUDYING THE ISSUE OF ACCESSION, HOWEVER, AND WITH 15 </p><p>MEMBER COUNTRIES MAY REQUIRE SOME MORE TIME TO FORM A </p><p>COHESIVE RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>     -- MONGOLIA IS INTERESTED IN ACCEDING TO THE PROTOCOL, </p><p>AND SEEKS THE VIEWS OF OTHER POTENTIAL CONTRACTING PARTIES. </p><p>MONGOLIA SOLICITED BILATERAL DIALOGUE ON THE ISSUE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00566  01 OF 02  091019Z </p><p> </p><p>     -- JAPAN, ROK, AND CANADA MADE POLITE BUT NON-COMMITTAL </p><p>RESPONSES, NOTING ONLY THAT ALL WERE STUDYING THE PROPOSAL. </p><p>OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OFFERED NO COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.   SWEDISH, NEW ZEALAND, AND ROK REPRESENTATIVES ALL </p><p>APPROACHED POLOFF AFTER THE MEETING SEEKING FURTHER DETAILS </p><p>ON THE U.S. POSITION.  ROK REPRESENTATIVE WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN LEARNING IF THE U.S. INTENDS NOT TO ACCEDE. </p><p>SWEDISH AMBASSADOR FOLLOWED UP WITH A CALL THE NEXT DAY </p><p>EMPHASIZING HER INTEREST IN U.S. VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   COMMENT:  VIETNAM IS STILL LOOKING FOR TANGIBLE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO MARK ITS TENURE AS ASEAN AND ARF CHAIR, </p><p>AND WOULD WELCOME MOVEMENT ON THE TAC.  ITS PONDEROUS AND </p><p>HESITANT CONSULTATION STYLE, HOWEVER, IMPEDES ITS OWN </p><p>OBJECTIVES; WHEN ASKED, CHI WAS UNWILLING TO CHARACTERIZE </p><p>PRELIMINARY REPONSES FROM THE U.S., JAPAN, AND NEW ZEALAND </p><p>IN EVEN GENERAL TERMS, SAYING THESE VIEWS WERE "SECRET." </p><p>NEW ZEALAND\'S VERY DETAILED RESPONSE, REPEATED TWICE, SEEMED </p><p>TO BE INTENDED AS A COUNTERPOINT.  EMBASSY EXPECTS CONTINUED </p><p>REQUESTS FROM LOCAL COUNTERPARTS FOR FEEDBACK ON OUR </p><p>POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
