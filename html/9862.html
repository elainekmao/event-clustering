<p>S E C R E T KATHMANDU 001472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA, SA/INS, EAP, INR/EAP, INR/B, AND NP/RA </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PINR, PARM, KN, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST:  NEPALESE PARTY LEADER INVITED TO </p><p>NORTH KOREA; OFFERS TO WORK WITH THE USG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) On August 1, Pashupati SJB Rana, Chairman of </p><p>Nepal\'s National Democratic Party (RPP), reported to the </p><p>Ambassador that he has been invited to travel to North Korea </p><p>by its Ambassador to Nepal, Jon Son Myong.  Rana offered to </p><p>deliver points that align with U.S. policy, and he is willing </p><p>to meet with persons of interest to the USG.  Post will </p><p>provide Rana with publicly available background information </p><p>on North Korea and U.S. policy and suggests that the </p><p>Department may wish to provide more specific information. </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Rana has been for years a valuable contact who, </p><p>Post believes, could serve as a useful source of information </p><p>on North Korea and a reliable conduit for messages that </p><p>reinforce U.S. policy.  The Department may wish to take </p><p>advantage of this opportunity by providing talking points </p><p>that reinforce U.S. policies of democracy and free market </p><p>economy, a list of desired contacts, and subjects of interest. </p><p> </p><p>Biographic Information </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Pashupati SJB Rana was elected Chairman of the </p><p>Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), translated as the National </p><p>Democratic Party, on December 14, 2002 for a four-year term. </p><p>Rana served as the Water Resources Minister from September </p><p>12, 1995 to April 1998, where he actively promoted private </p><p>sector development of Nepal\'s many rivers.  Grandson of the </p><p>last hereditary Rana Prime Minister, Mohan Shumshere, Rana </p><p>comes from a wealthy and privileged family.  He was the chief </p><p>player in negotiating the much despised Mahakali Treaty with </p><p>India, which lead to the collapse of the 1996 Communist-led </p><p>coalition government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Rana has held prominent positions since the </p><p>Panchayat era--a period (1960-90) in Nepal\'s political </p><p>history when the King appointed members to a hierarchy of </p><p>quasi-democratic councils.  He began his government career in </p><p>1964 as a Joint Secretary in the Panchayat\'s Research and </p><p>Training Section.  He later rose to the positions of Minister </p><p>for Education and Tourism (1977-79), Minister for Water </p><p>Resources (1983-86), and Minister for Local Development </p><p>(1986-88).  He is a founding member of the RPP, a party </p><p>created to bring together former Panchayat appointees, and </p><p>served as its the General Secretary from 1990 to 2002. </p><p>During the current period of turbulent politics, Post finds </p><p>Rana to be one of Nepal\'s most reasonable advocates of </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Rana is popular in Sindhupalchowk district, north </p><p>of Kathmandu, from which he has been elected three times to </p><p>Parliament.  Highly intelligent, articulate, and anglicized </p><p>in manner, Rana is a talented public speaker.  Rana grew up </p><p>in England and received a BA from Oxford University in 1963. </p><p>He has been to the U.S. on a VOLVIS program.  An art </p><p>historian by advocation, Rana has published several articles </p><p>on the subject.  He is active in promoting Nepal as a World </p><p>Site with UNESCO.  His wife is the daughter of Maharaja of </p><p>Gwalior, with whom he has two daughters. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
