IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING WIDER </p><p>DISSEMINATION, CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OF INFORMATION </p><p>CANNOT BE INCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. BEGIN SUMMARY.  SYRIA HAS TOUGHENED ITS PEACE-PROCESS </p><p>POSITION SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>INTERIM AGREEMENT. ASAD IS PROBABLY NOT CAPABLE OF </p><p>MAKING THE GESTURES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO JUMP START </p><p>THIS TRACK DURING AN ISRAELI ELECTION YEAR. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE SIGNING OF THE INTERIM AGREEMENT HAS INCREASED </p><p>SYRIA\'S ISOLATION, AND THE AMMAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT, IN </p><p>WHICH SYRIA WILL NOT PARTICIPATE, WILL INCREASE IT </p><p>ANOTHER STEP. ASAD BELIEVES RABIN WILL EXPLOIT THIS </p><p>DEEPENING ISOLATION AND THE UPCOMING ISRAELI ELECTIONS TO </p><p>TRY TO WIN CONCESSIONS FROM DAMASCUS. IN RESPONSE, ASAD </p><p>AND THE SENIOR SYRIAN LEADERSHIP HAVE DUG IN. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN A LENGTHY OCTOBER 11 INTERVIEW WITH THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>DAILY AL-AHRAM, ASAD WAS AT HIS MOST STUBBORN. "NO </p><p>MATTER HOW THINGS CHANGE, WE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING WE DO </p><p>NOT BELIEVE IN."  ISRAEL WAS AT FAULT IN THE CONTROVERSY </p><p>OVER THE EARLY-WARNING STATIONS. ISRAELI-MANNED EARLY- </p><p>WARNING STATIONS ON THE GOLAN WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT ON </p><p>SYRIAN SOVEREIGNTY.   "MEETING FOR THE SAKE OF MEETING" </p><p>BENEFITED ONLY ISRAEL. TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAD NO REASON </p><p>TO MEET UNTIL POLITICAL DECISION-MAKERS HAVE MADE A </p><p>DECISION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TONE MORE NEGATIVE </p><p> </p><p>4. FOREIGN MINISTER SHARA HAS USED A SHARPER TONE </p><p>RECENTLY, TO PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER ARAB STATES AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS NOT TO TAKE STEPS SYRIA SAYS WOULD HARM ITS </p><p>NEGOTIATING POSITION. HE TOLD THE EGYPTIAN WEEKLY ROSE </p><p>AL-YUSUF ON SEPTEMBER 30 THE AMMAN SUMMIT WOULD "GREATLY </p><p>HARM" THE SYRIAN AND LEBANESE TRACKS AND THAT "ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ANY ARAB COUNTRY WOULD </p><p>WEAKEN SYRIAN\'S STANCE IN THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS." </p><p>ARAB STATES, HE ASSERTED, WOULD "FACE DANGERS" IF ISRAEL </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN CONCLUDING REGIONAL-COOPERATION AGREEMENTS </p><p>IN AMMAN. AT THE UN ON OCTOBER 3 SHARA SAID SYRIA WOULD </p><p>"NEITHER SUPPORT NOR SEEK TO HAMPER REGIONAL AGREEMENTS" </p><p>BUT THAT "ANY USE OF THESE AGREEMENTS TO HARM THE </p><p>NATIONAL AND PAN-ARAB INTEREST AND RIGHTS OF SYRIA WILL </p><p>COMPEL US TO RECONSIDER OUR POSITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT SYRIA CAN AND CANNOT DO </p><p> </p><p>5. BEYOND SUCH RHETORIC, SYRIA CAN DO LITTLE TO IMPEDE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JORDANIAN-ISRAELI TREATY OR THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT. THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>REJECTIONIST GROUPS RESIDING IN DAMASCUS HAVE NEVER BEEN </p><p>EFFECTIVE PLAYERS ON THE PALESTINIAN SCENE. ASAD APPEARS </p><p>NOT TO DELUDE HIMSELF ON THIS POINT, AND THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>NO SIGNS THAT SYRIA HAS STEPPED UP ITS LIMITED SUPPORT TO </p><p>THESE GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>6. BUT SYRIA CAN PREVENT MOVEMENT ON THE ISRAELI- </p><p>LEBANESE TRACK AND SLOW NORMALIZATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND </p><p>THE WIDER ARAB WORLD.  OTHER ARAB STATES BELIEVE THE </p><p>SYRIAN-ISRAELI TRACK MUST BE SOLVED BEFORE A TRULY NEW </p><p>DYNAMIC CAN BE UNLEASHED IN THE AREA. SYRIA PLAYS ON </p><p>WIDESPREAD ARAB FEARS OF THE "DANGER" TO THE REGION OF A </p><p>STRENGTHENED ISRAEL AND ON ANTI-ISRAELI SENTIMENT </p><p>PREVALENT AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION IN MOST ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES TO KEEP ARAB NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL AT BAY. </p><p>MEANWHILE IT WILL URGE EGYPT TO SUPPORT SYRIA PUBLICLY </p><p>AND LOBBY WASHINGTON ON ITS BEHALF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STEADFAST SYRIA </p><p> </p><p>7. ASAD\'S RIGID VIEW OF WHAT IS NEEDED (COMPLIANCE WITH </p><p>242 AND 338, I. E., FULL ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE </p><p>TERRITORY ISRAEL OCCUPIED IN 1967) PRECLUDES HIM FROM </p><p>OFFERING THE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY GESTURES - MUCH LESS </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE CONCESSIONS - NEEDED TO GET THE BALL ROLLING. </p><p>ASAD BELIEVES THAT ANY GESTURE HE MIGHT OFFER, EVEN </p><p>PROCEDURAL, IN THE ABSENCE OF CONCRETE ASSURANCES THAT </p><p>THE GOLAN WILL BE RETURNED IN FULL WOULD BE A MAJOR AND </p><p>UNREQUITED CONCESSION TO ISRAEL. CONSTRAINED FROM ACTION </p><p>BY THIS VIEW, HE WAITS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE THE </p><p>FIRST GESTURE AND BROKER THE GRAND DEAL OF FULL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FOR FULL PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>8. WITHOUT A US-BROKERED SETTLEMENT, SYRIA WILL CONTENT </p><p>ITSELF WITH PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO THE PROCESS AND </p><p>REITERATING A POSITION THAT HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE </p><p>1991 MADRID CONFERENCE: SYRIA WANTS PEACE (ON ITS OWN </p><p>TERMS); ISRAEL\'S "IMPOSSIBLE DEMANDS11 ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE LACK OF PROGRESS; THE UNITED STATES MUST INTERCEDE </p><p>WITH ISRAEL IF PEACE IS TO BE ACHIEVED; AND "NO PEACE" IS </p><p>BETTER THAN "PEACE WITHOUT HONOR." (DRAFTED OCTOBER 20 </p><p>BY INR/NESA: CONNY MAYER) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
