(C) ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC) CHAIRMAN </p><p>SOBUSA GULA-NDEBELE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER 29 THAT </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION AND ZIMBABWEAN LAW ARE VAGUE ABOUT THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ESC AND THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND ACKNOWLEDGED PREVIOUS DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO ELECTORAL BODIES.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE ELECTORAL ACT WOULD REQUIRE THAT </p><p>DOMESTIC MONITORS BE DRAWN EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE RANKS OF </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS AND THAT NGO\'S WOULD BE ABLE TO CONDUCT </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION, BUT WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER WITH, AND HAVE </p><p>THEIR MATERIALS CLEARED BY, THE ESC.  GULA-NDEBELE LAMENTED </p><p>THE LOW TURNOUT IN THE CURRENT VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS, </p><p>SAYING IT REFLECTED BOTH POLITICAL APATHY AND A LACK OF </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION.   HE ADVOCATED FORMATION OF A FULL-FLEDGED </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION RATHER THAN A SUPERVISORY BODY, BUT </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT SOME IN THE GOZ AND LEGAL COMMUNITY </p><p>BELIEVE THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGAL </p><p>CHANGES.  GULA-NDEBELE AGREED THAT POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD </p><p>BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INPUT TO THE WORK OF THE ESC AND NOTED </p><p>THAT HE MAINTAINED GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH ZANU-PF AND THE </p><p>MDC.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. INTEREST </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 29 MEETING WITH ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY </p><p>COMMISSION CHAIRMAN SOBUSA GULA-NDEBELE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>SAID THE UNITED STATES IS NOT SEEKING TO INSTRUCT ZIMBABWE </p><p>ON HOW TO RUN ELECTIONS.  WE HAVE, HOWEVER, TAKEN A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN THE ELECTION PROCESS, ABOUT WHICH </p><p>WE WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO RENDER OUR JUDGMENT.  WE ARE </p><p>GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ONGOING VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION, WHICH WE HAVE REPEATEDLY URGED THE GOZ TO </p><p>ADDRESS.  THE ELECTORAL NORMS AND STANDARDS ENDORSED BY THE </p><p>SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM IN MARCH 2001 PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS.  THERE IS TIME FOR </p><p>THE GOZ TO REVERSE COURSE AND IMPROVE THE ELECTION PROCESS. </p><p>IF THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE USG CAN BE HELPFUL, WE WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO DO WHAT WE CAN.  THE AMBASSADOR SOLICITED GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS TO DATE AND </p><p>HOW IT WOULD UNFOLD IN THE RUN-UP TO NEXT YEAR\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GULA-NDEBELE ASKED WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>MEANT WHEN HE SAID THE PROCESS NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED -- WAS </p><p>HE REFERRING TO THE TECHNICAL ARRANGEMENTS OR THE GENERAL </p><p>POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT?  THE ENVIRONMENT IS OUR BIGGEST </p><p>CONCERN, THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED, BUT WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT SOME OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE ELECTORAL ACT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN A TEXT, THEY APPEAR DESIGNED </p><p>TO DISENFRANCHISE LARGE NUMBERS OF VOTERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03630  01 OF 04  041529Z </p><p> </p><p>ROLE OF ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GULA-NDEBELE NOTED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONFERS A </p><p>VAGUE SUPERVISORY ROLE ON THE ESC, CHARGING IT WITH </p><p>SUPERVISING, NOT RUNNING, VOTER REGISTRATION AND THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS.  THE ELECTORAL ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE </p><p>MUCH CLARIFICATION, WITH LITTLE MORE THAN VAGUE STATEMENTS </p><p>REGARDING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ESC AND THE REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL OF ELECTIONS.  IT ALSO STATES THAT THE REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL "SHALL," WHICH GULA-NDEBELE INTERPRETS TO MEAN </p><p>"MUST," TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ESC. </p><p>ASKED WHAT AVENUES ARE OPEN TO THE COMMISSION IF IT </p><p>DISAPPROVES OF ACTIONS BY THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE SAID THE ESC MAKES ITS VIEWS KNOWN TO THE R-G. </p><p>THE ESC CHAIRMAN ACKNOWLEDGED DIFFICULTIES IN THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, NOTING "SOME GLITCHES" OVER ACCREDITATION OF </p><p>MONITORS DURING THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MONITORS/OBSERVERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE ESC CHAIRMAN SAID HE HAD NOT SEEN THE LATEST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4753 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03630  02 OF 04  041529Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------46CF04  041529Z /38 </p><p>P 041437Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0461 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003630 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER -- PLEASE PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03630  02 OF 04  041529Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES ELECTION WITH ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERVISORY COMMISSION CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT OF THE GOZ\'S PROPOSED ELECTORAL ACT AMENDMENTS, BUT </p><p>THAT HE HAD PROVIDED HIS COMMENTS ON AN EARLIER VERSION. </p><p>HE BELIEVED THE LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF DOMESTIC MONITORS </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THE PROVISION ON MONITORS IS </p><p>THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL, GULA-NDEBELE ACKNOWLEDGED.  THE </p><p>GOZ, HE SAID, PLANS TO REQUIRE THAT DOMESTIC MONITORS BE </p><p>DRAWN FROM EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE RANKS OF CIVIL SERVANTS -- </p><p>A COURSE OF ACTION THE ESC HAD NOT RECOMMENDED.  HE DID NOT </p><p>OBJECT TO THIS IN PRINCIPLE, AS IT WAS A GOOD THING TO </p><p>CREATE A POOL OF TRAINED PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE AND </p><p>EXPERTISE.  HE WAS CONCERNED, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE PLAN\'S </p><p>FEASIBILITY.  THE ESC, HE SAID, HAS NORMALLY ASSIGNED FOUR </p><p>MONITORS TO EACH OF APPROXIMATELY 4,000 POLLING STATIONS, </p><p>TOTALING 16,000 MONITORS.  HE QUESTIONED WHETHER SO MANY </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS COULD BE AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS FOR THE TIME </p><p>REQUIRED WITHOUT THEIR ABSENCES HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON </p><p>THE FUNCTIONING OF GOVERNMENT.   HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE WIDESPREAD PERCEPTION THAT CIVIL SERVANTS ARE </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  THEY ARE NOT, HE </p><p>INSISTED, NOTING THE STRONG UNIONISM PREVAILING WITHIN THE </p><p>CIVIL SERVICE AND THE NUMEROUS CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS AND THE GOZ SINCE 1990, BUT HE DECLARED THAT </p><p>SOMETIMES PERCEPTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN REALITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, GULA- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03630  02 OF 04  041529Z </p><p>NDEBELE SAID, A LOOSE ARRANGEMENT OF CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>PROVIDED DOMESTIC MONITORS FOR AN ESC-SUPERVISED MONITORING </p><p>EFFORT.  ALTHOUGH NGOS LIKELY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO </p><p>SERVE AS "MONITORS" THIS TIME, THEY WOULD BE PERMITTED TO </p><p>ACT AS "OBSERVERS."  ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE SAID MONITORS ARE AN ARM OF THE ESC AND CAN </p><p>INTERVENE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS TO POINT OUT </p><p>IRREGULARITIES.  OBSERVERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, REMAIN </p><p>OUTSIDE THE POLLING STATIONS BUT CAN POINT OUT ANY </p><p>IRREGULARITIES THEY OBSERVE TO THE ESC OR LOCAL </p><p>CONSTITUENCY REGISTRAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GULA-NDEBELE SAID THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE (MOJ) HAS </p><p>ACCEPTED AN ESC RECOMMENDATION THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER </p><p>GROUPS BE PERMITTED TO OBSERVE BOTH THE PRE-ELECTORAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND THE VOTING DAYS THEMSELVES.  HE IS ALSO </p><p>RECOMMENDING THAT ACCREDITED INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO ENTER VOTING PLACES TO OBSERVE.  "WE THINK WE </p><p>HAVE A GOOD TECHNICAL SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR RUNNING ELECTIONS </p><p>AND WE\'D LIKE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO SEE IT," GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE SAID.  ASKED HOW LONG IN ADVANCE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVER GROUPS WOULD BE PERMITTED ON THE GROUND, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE DESCRIBED THAT ISSUE AS "VERY TRICKY," BUT BELIEVED </p><p>BOTH MONITORS AND OBSERVERS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED AS SOON AS </p><p>THE ELECTION DATES ARE ANNOUNCED, AND REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL </p><p>3-5 DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) GULA-NDEBELE TOLD US HE HAD ALSO RECOMMENDED TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03630  02 OF 04  041529Z </p><p>MOJ ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONWIDE, COORDINATED VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION PROGRAM ORGANIZED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE ESC.  WE </p><p>WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE INSISTED, AND THAT NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE DO TO THEM </p><p>OUTSIDE THE POLLING CENTER, THEY CANNOT BE INFLUENCED OR </p><p>INTIMIDATED ONCE THEY GO INSIDE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. </p><p>VOTER EDUCATION, HE ASSERTED, IS CRUCIAL IN EMPOWERING </p><p>PEOPLE, SO LONG AS IT IS DONE IN A "COORDINATED FASHION." </p><p>HE SAID NGOS WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION, </p><p>BUT THEY FIRST WILL HAVE TO REGISTER WITH THE ESC AND CLEAR </p><p>WITH THE ELECTORAL BODY THE MATERIALS THEY PLAN TO USE. </p><p>SUCH AN APPROACH, GULA-NDEBELE SAID, ALLOWS THE ESC TO </p><p>ENSURE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS COVERED AND ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>INFORMATION CONVEYED TO VOTERS IS CONSISTENT, UNIFORM, AND </p><p>NON-PARTISAN.  THE ESC CHAIRMAN DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF </p><p>ALLOWING POLITICAL PARTIES TO CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION -- </p><p>BECAUSE IT CONVEYS THE WRONG IMPRESSION OF WHAT VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION SHOULD BE ABOUT -- BUT MANY IN THE GOZ, HE SAID, </p><p>BELIEVE POLITICAL PARTIES CANNOT BE STOPPED FROM DOING IT, </p><p>AND THAT, THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED. </p><p> </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4757 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03630  03 OF 04  041530Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------46CF14  041530Z /38 </p><p>P 041437Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0462 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003630 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER -- PLEASE PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03630  03 OF 04  041530Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES ELECTION WITH ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERVISORY COMMISSION CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR INQUIRED ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE </p><p>CURRENT MOBILE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS.  GULA-NDEBELE </p><p>EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LOW TURNOUT SO FAR, AND </p><p>LAMENTED THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THEY NEED TO </p><p>REGISTER.  ASKED WHETHER THERE ARE ANY REMEDIES, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE REPLIED, "YES, BETTER VOTER EDUCATION EFFORTS."  IN </p><p>A SURPRISING ADMISSION, THE ESC CHAIRMAN SAID HE HAD NEVER </p><p>BEFORE VOTED, BOTH BECAUSE HE HAS NEVER BEEN ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>ABOUT HIS CHOICE OF CANDIDATES AND BECAUSE HE DOES NOT </p><p>PLACE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN POLITICIANS.  THAT KIND OF APATHY </p><p>IS COMMON IN ZIMBABWE, HE CONTINUED, AND IS EXACERBATED BY </p><p>THE WIDESPREAD PERCEPTION THAT THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM CAN BE </p><p>MANIPULATED.  SINCE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT THE REGISTRATION </p><p>PERIOD CONCLUDE WITHIN A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME PRIOR TO </p><p>THE ELECTION, AND SINCE ELECTION DATES HAVE NOT YET BEEN </p><p>ANNOUNCED, GULA-NDEBELE THOUGHT IT INEVITABLE THAT THE </p><p>REGISTRATION PERIOD WOULD HAVE TO BE EXTENDED BEYOND THE </p><p>CURRENT MID-DECEMBER DEADLINE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED GULA-NDEBELE HE HAD HEARD </p><p>COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY REGISTERING. </p><p>THE ESC CHAIRMAN COMMENTED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED </p><p>IF THOSE REPORTS ARE TRUE, AS HE HAS LONG FOUND CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS RIGID -- "LUNCHTIME IS LUNCHTIME" TO THEM -- AND </p><p>VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH.  HE SAID THE REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL\'S OFFICE HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTING ON SUCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03630  03 OF 04  041530Z </p><p>COMPLAINTS, BUT HE ADVISED PEOPLE FACING DIFFICULTIES TO </p><p>NOTIFY THE MEDIA.  CIVIL SERVANTS, HE SAID, DO NOT LIKE </p><p>BEING BLAMED, AND PARTICULARLY DISLIKE PRESS COVERAGE OF </p><p>THEIR MISDEEDS.  (NOTE: HIGH COURT JUDGE ANN GOORA </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY ORDERED THE GOVERNMENT, ON DECEMBER 3, TO </p><p>RELAX THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON THOSE WISHING </p><p>TO REGISTER.  HER RULING WAS ISSUED IN A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY </p><p>THE MDC CHALLENGING THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL\'S INSISTENCE THAT </p><p>INDIVIDUALS SUBMIT PROOF OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN ORDER TO </p><p>REGISTER.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ONE WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THEY HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED, GULA-NDEBELE SUGGESTED, WAS TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>GENUINE ELECTORAL COMMISSION, IN THE MODEL OF OTHER SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES INSTEAD OF A BODY WHICH PLAYED ONLY AN </p><p>SUPERVISORY ROLE.  HE NOTED THAT ESC MEMBERSHIP IS A "PART- </p><p>TIME JOB" -- HE EARNS HIS LIVING BY RUNNING HIS OWN FIVE- </p><p>ATTORNEY LAW PRACTICE -- AND LAMENTED THAT ONLY FOUR OF THE </p><p>FIVE ESC SEATS ARE CURRENTLY FILLED.  WAS ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>AN ELECTORAL COMMISSION POSSIBLE BEFORE NEXT YEAR\'S </p><p>ELECTION, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED?   THERE IS DISAGREEMENT </p><p>WITHIN THE GOZ AND LEGAL COMMUNITY ON THIS POINT, GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE REPLIED.  HE PERSONALLY THOUGHT SUCH A STEP WOULD </p><p>BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION, WHILE OTHERS </p><p>THOUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL AND/OR LEGAL CHANGES WOULD BE </p><p>REQUIRED FIRST. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF CITIZENS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03630  03 OF 04  041530Z </p><p>HAVING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES.  ONE </p><p>APPROACH TAKEN IN SOME COUNTRIES IS TO ALLOW THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES ON ELECTORAL </p><p>COMMISSIONS, SOMETIMES AS NON-VOTING MEMBERS.  WAS THIS </p><p>POSSIBLE IN ZIMBABWE?  GULA-NDEBELE REPLIED THAT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM MEMBERSHIP ON THE ESC, </p><p>HE DID NOT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>INPUT.  HE NOTED THAT HE MAINTAINED GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CURRENT ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>POLITICAL DIVIDE.
