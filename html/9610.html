<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  TUNIS 001947 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ENA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALL ON PRIME MINISTER </p><p>GHANNOUCHI </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Rust M. Deming, Embassy Tunis </p><p>Reason:  1.5 (B) and (C) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, paid a </p><p>farewell call July 22 on Tunisian Prime Minister Mohamed </p><p>Ghannouchi.  In a wide-ranging review of US-Tunisian </p><p>bilateral relations, the Ambassador encouraged the GOT to </p><p>build on its impressive record of economic and social </p><p>development and to continue efforts to integrate Tunisia and </p><p>its regional partners into the global economic and political </p><p>system.  PM Ghannouchi noted the historic ties between the </p><p>two countries, and expressed appreciation for US economic and </p><p>development assistance dating from the earliest days of </p><p>Tunisian independence.  The PM said that Tunisia continued to </p><p>place great value on its relationship with the United States, </p><p>even if it disagreed at times with US policies in the region. </p><p> He agreed that a consensus existed in Tunisia on the need to </p><p>build a more democratic society, but argued that this must be </p><p>undertaken at a measured pace to avoid "mistakes."  The GOT </p><p>looked forward to the first Trade and Investment Framework </p><p>Agreement (TIFA) roundtable in Washington in the fall, and </p><p>said the Minister of Development and International </p><p>Cooperation would likely lead the Tunisian delegation to the </p><p>talks.  On regional issues, the PM underlined the need for </p><p>continued US engagement in efforts to resolve the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict and urged the US to put Q place </p><p>an interim Iraqi government and proceed quickly with the </p><p>reconstruction of the country and the reintegration of Iraq </p><p>into the global economy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador paid a farewell call on Tunisian Prime </p><p>Minister Ghannouchi on July 22.  During his tenure as Prime </p><p>Minister, Ghannouchi has served as the coordinator of GOT </p><p>economic policy and the conversation focused on economic </p><p>issues.  The Ambassador expressed optimism about the state of </p><p>US-Tunisian relations, and noted that even during periods of </p><p>disagreement on regional issues, Tunisians kept their longer </p><p>term interests in mind and maintained an open channel of </p><p>communication with US officials.  The PM replied that </p><p>US-Tunisian ties were longstanding, and he expressed deep </p><p>appreciation for the historic role of the United States in </p><p>assisting Tunisian development from the earliest days of the </p><p>country\'s independence.  Noting the role of USAID and other </p><p>USG agencies in Tunisia, the PM said these infrastructure and </p><p>development projects had made the Tunisian economy "better </p><p>armed" to face the increasing demands of globalization.  The </p><p>PM added that the GOT remained concerned about the future, </p><p>particularly in view of the world economic downturn, but his </p><p>government was committed to staying the course on support for </p><p>education, infrastructure development and private sector </p><p>reform. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s comment that there </p><p>appeared to be a large consensus within the Tunisian </p><p>political class on the need to build a more open political </p><p>and economic system and a more democratic society, the PM </p><p>said the only point of contention was on the speed of reform. </p><p> Agreeing that there was "no debate" in Tunisia on the need </p><p>to safeguard the country\'s achievements in the social and </p><p>economic sectors (particularly with regard to the rights of </p><p>women), the PM stated that the GOT did "not have the freedom </p><p>to make mistakes," and "must remain vigilant" to the threat </p><p>from the secular extremists on the left and the religious </p><p>extremists on the right.  PM Ghannouchi added that the GOT </p><p>was committed to maintaining the "tolerant, moderate and </p><p>progressive" character of the Tunisian state, but that this </p><p>required a gradual approach.  Appealing for understanding </p><p>from the west about the measured pace of political opening in </p><p>Tunisia, the PM joked that "even in the US you have speed </p><p>limits on your highways!" </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the economic front, the Ambassador said that he </p><p>hoped to see increased US investment in Tunisia, and that in </p><p>this regard, it would be important to resolve </p><p>Algerian-Moroccan bilateral differences over the Western </p><p>Sahara in order to reinvigorate the moribund Arab Maghreb </p><p>Union (UMA, in French).  The PM agreed that the slow pace of </p><p>regional economic integration placed Tunisia and its partners </p><p>at a disadvantage, but he expressed the hope that UMA could </p><p>be revived and that Tunisia would attract increased foreign </p><p>direct investment, particularly from US companies.  Reviewing </p><p>Tunisia\'s efforts to build a "larger economic space," </p><p>Ghannouchi reitrated the GOT commitment to the Barcelona </p><p>Process, the 5 plus 5 dialogue, and the expansion of free </p><p>trade agreements between Europe and North Africa. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turning to other bilateral and regional issues, the PM </p><p>said that Tunisia looked forward to the first TIFA roundtable </p><p>in Washington in the fall, and confirmed that the Minister of </p><p>Development and International Cooperation would likely lead </p><p>the GOT delegation.  On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, </p><p>Ghannouchi said the success of the process hinged on </p><p>continued US engagement.  On Iraq, the PM underlined the </p><p>importance for Tunisia and the rest of the Arab world of the </p><p>establishment of an interim government headed by Iraqis, </p><p>adding that the reconstruction of Iraq and the reintegration </p><p>of the country into the world economy were equally critical. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  There are rumors rampant of a significant </p><p>government reshuffle following the ruling RCD party congress </p><p>next week, so the Prime Minister may be replaced, along with </p><p>many members of his government.  Despite this, we expect the </p><p>broad lines of Tunisian domestic and foreign policy to remain </p><p>constant.  Tunisia places a high value on its bilateral </p><p>relationship with the United States, and before the conflict </p><p>in Iraq, senior GOT interlocutors assured us that the </p><p>relationship would weather the storm.  This has proven to be </p><p>the case, and Ghannouchi\'s comments reflect the broad view </p><p>within the GOT that it is important to move quickly to resume </p><p>business as usual.  The Tunisians see the upcoming TIFA </p><p>discussions as part of this, and the GOT looks forward to an </p><p>enriched bilateral dialogue on a range of issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEMING </p><p></p></div>
