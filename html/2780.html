(SBU) A shrinking economy (GDP has declined by </p><p>about 25 percent since 1998), land resettlement, high </p><p>inflation, an artificially pegged currency and weak </p><p>mineral prices have combined recently to cause </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s exports to contract sharply, with the 2001 </p><p>total down about 30 percent from their peak in 1997. </p><p>With export earnings down so steeply and economic </p><p>conditions so bad, the current food shortage could </p><p>probably not have come at a worse time.  There are </p><p>simply no Zimdollars in the budget, nor forex in the </p><p>central bank, to buy food, the country\'s offshore </p><p>credit standing is non-existent, the development aid </p><p>tap is turned off, and its external arrears currently </p><p>exceed US $1.3 billion.  The chart below provides gross </p><p>trade data for last year and our best projections on </p><p>trade flows for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Top Export Categories (US$ millions) </p><p> </p><p>                    2001 Earnings       2002(Estimate) </p><p> </p><p>Tobacco             $643 (see note)     $465 </p><p>Manuf\'d Exports     $534.7              $420 </p><p>Gold                $166                $140 </p><p>Other Mineral       $174                $150 </p><p>Horticulture        $68                 $52 </p><p>Other Agricultural  $62                 $50 </p><p>Tourism/Hunting     $28                 $18 </p><p> </p><p>Gross Exports       $1,748              $1,034 </p><p> </p><p>For.Dir.

(SBU) The data, which is admittedly very rough and </p><p>should be viewed as indicative, shows a gross shortfall </p><p>last year of about US half a billion dollars, and an </p><p>estimated shortfall in 2002 of about $1.2 billion. </p><p>(The foreign arrears account provides a quick proxy </p><p>check on these calculations; at year-end 2000 it was </p><p>about US $800 million, and at year-end 2001 it was </p><p>about $1.3 billion, an increase of $500 million.)  The </p><p>very large balance-of-payments shortfall means that </p><p>Zimbabwe has absolutely no chance of paying for </p><p>necessary food imports, unless it strips the hard </p><p>currency out of the economy, which will further damage </p><p>it and accelerate the decline of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment: This very basic analysis shows that </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economic woes are set to worsen, likely </p><p>drastically and quickly.  Under a worst case scenario </p><p>and if current trends are not reversed, in the span of </p><p>five years starting at the end of 1998 the ZANU-PF </p><p>leadership may very well succeed in halving Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>GDP, dropping per capita income from the US $400 range </p><p>to the $200 range.  This would place Zimbabwe on par </p><p>with the likes of Laos, Togo, Bangladesh and Senegal. </p><p>Whites in Zimbabwe constitute about 0.6 percent of the </p><p>population, and about a third of those are commercial </p><p>farmers.  Claiming that he is correcting injustices of </p><p>race and land, Mugabe appears willing to inflict </p><p>astounding damage on his black countrymen and their </p><p>economic inheritance for his own self-interest.  This </p><p>is the unfortunate stuff of legend.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
