(U) SUMMARY: On September 7, Zimbabwe police and </p><p>soldiers raided the UNICEF facilities and illegally seized </p><p>food UNICEF had been storing for UN employees.  After </p><p>appealing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the UN received </p><p>an apology from the guilty parties and expected to have the </p><p>stolen food returned on September 11 but by mid-day on </p><p>September 12 we were unable to confirm whether it had been </p><p>returned.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>UN FOOD SEIZED </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2.  (U) On September 7, Zimbabwe police and soldiers raided </p><p>the UNICEF compound and seized food UNICEF had been storing </p><p>for the UN employees and their dependents, according to Kirk </p><p>Hoffman, Operation Manager at UNICEF.  The UN has been </p><p>importing food every three months for its 1000 employees </p><p>(3000 dependents) in Zimbabwe for several months.  UNICEF </p><p>kept the food on its premises because it has the space to do </p><p>so and was in the process of distributing it when the police </p><p>and soldiers raided the facility.  In addition to seizing the </p><p>food (there were eight staple food commodities), the police </p><p>and soldiers beat up two UNICEF staff members and searched </p><p>diplomatic (CD) vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) During the raid, UN officials advised the </p><p>belligerents several times that they were violating UN </p><p>immunities and privileges.  After the attackers left, the UN </p><p>complained to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the highest </p><p>level and has since been provided with the names of the </p><p>perpetrators, an apology, a promise to return the items by </p><p>the end of the day on September 11, and permission to open a </p><p>legal case against those who assaulted the UNICEF staff. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>FOOD AID SECURITY IN QUESTION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: The raid on UNICEF further flags concerns </p><p>about the security of food aid imported into Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>fact that the Zimbabwe police and military can disregard the </p><p>immunity afforded the UN and seize food does not particularly </p><p>bode well for food secured by other international </p><p>organizations.  The Government\'s response in this case will </p><p>provide clear indications of how similar problems will be </p><p>handled in the future, and what additional steps might be </p><p>necessary to ensure adequate security arrangements for </p><p>donated food.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
