IRVING.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  AT A SEPTEMBER 26 FAREWELL LUNCH WITH </p><p>THE DCM, THE MFA\'S UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI REPORTED THAT ZIMBABWE IS CLOSE TO </p><p>WITHDRAWING UP TO HALF ITS TROOPS FROM THE DROC. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI DESCRIBED KABILA\'S BRIEF TRIP TO LUANDA ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 24 AS A LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT TO GET ANGOLA TO </p><p>FILL ZIMBABWE\'S SHOES.  THE POLITICAL PRESSURE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO WITHDRAW HAS BECOME TOO GREAT FOR MUGABE TO </p><p>IGNORE, ACCORDING TO THE UNDERSECRETARY.  HE JUST </p><p>RETURNED FROM A WEEK-LONG TRIP TO KINSHASA, WHERE HE </p><p>WILL SOON MANAGE A NEW OFFICE STAFFED BY DROC ALLIES </p><p>DESIGNED TO COORDINATE PEACE EFFORTS IN THE REGION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON SEPTEMBER 26, DCM AND POLOFF HOSTED A </p><p>FAREWELL LUNCH FOR UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI, WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF THE EMBASSY\'S MOST </p><p>FRANK AND STRAIGHTFORWARD CONTACTS IN ZIMBABWE\'S MFA. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO KINSHASA (APPARENTLY </p><p>SOMEWHAT AGAINST HIS WILL) TO MANAGE AN OFFICE BEING SET </p><p>UP BY THE DROC\'S ALLIES TO OVERSEE THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>THERE.  THE OFFICE WILL BE HEADED BY A ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>"SPECIAL ASSISTANT" WITH AMBASSADORIAL RANK (WHOM </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI DID NOT NAME), WITH HAMADZIRIPI IN CHARGE OF </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANGOLA, </p><p>NAMIBIA, AND DROC WILL BE POSTED TO THE OFFICE; </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05464  01 OF 02  271611Z </p><p>CONGOLESE WILL FILL THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ONE OF THE OFFICE\'S FIRST MISSIONS WILL </p><p>APPARENTLY BE TO OVERSEE THE WITHDRAWAL OF UP TO HALF OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S 12,000 TROOPS IN THE DROC.  HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>STATED THAT ZIMBABWE BEGAN CONTEMPLATING THE WITHDRAWAL </p><p>TWO MONTHS AGO, AND IT HAS BEGUN THE NECESSARY PLANNING. </p><p>HE REPORTED THAT COMMANDER OF THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE </p><p>FORCES (ZDF) VITALIS ZVINAVASHE HAD JUST COMPLETED A </p><p>TRIP TO KINSHASA IN WHICH HE INFORMED KABILA THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS REALLY WITHDRAWING.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL WOULD PROCEED WHETHER OR NOT ANGOLA IS ABLE </p><p>TO STEP INTO THE ZIMBABWEAN ARMY\'S POSITIONS. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI STATED THAT KABILA WENT TO LUANDA SEPTEMBER </p><p>24 TO CONVINCE ANGOLA TO FILL ZIMBABWE\'S SHOES, BUT DID </p><p>NOT RECEIVE MANY ENCOURAGING SIGNS.  ALTHOUGH ZIMBABWE </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY COMPLETE ITS PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL BEFORE </p><p>THE TWO-MONTH EXTENSION ON THE MONUC OBSERVER FORCE IS </p><p>UP, HAMADZIRIPI ITERATED THAT THE PRESENCE OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FORCES WAS NOT LINKED TO THE MONUC DEPLOYMENT.  ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAS THE FREEDOM TO ROTATE ITS FORCES OR CHANGE THEIR </p><p>NUMBERS, JUST AS UGANDA HAS DONE, WITHOUT AFFECTING ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO KABILA\'S GOVERNMENT, "EXCEPT WE\'LL REALLY </p><p>DO IT," HE ADDED WRYLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI OPINED THAT THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>PRESSURE FOR A WITHDRAWAL WAS BECOMING TOO GREAT FOR </p><p>MUGABE TO IGNORE.  THE UNDERSECRETARY BELIEVED IT WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR MUGABE TO SHOW SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT IN </p><p>THIS AREA BEFORE THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THUS </p><p>REMOVE IT AS A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING CAMPAIGN ISSUE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05464  01 OF 02  271611Z </p><p>(NOTE: FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI RECENTLY REVEALED </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT THAT ZIMBABWE HAD SPENT US$200 MILLION ON </p><p>ITS DROC DEPLOYMENT SINCE THE WAR BEGAN.  A SEPTEMBER 26 </p><p>FRONT PAGE ARTICLE IN THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>REPORTED THAT KINSHASA OWES ZIMBABWE ARMY TRAINERS </p><p>US$800,000 IN BACK PAY.  END NOTE.)  WITH A PARTIAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL, THE GOZ IS ALSO DETERMINED TO SEND KABILA A </p><p>MESSAGE THAT IT WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE FOOT-DRAGGING ON </p><p>PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT IT IS SERIOUS ABOUT DISENGAGING </p><p>FROM THE DROC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: HAMADZIRIPI HAS PROVED TO BE A VERY </p><p>RELIABLE POINT MAN FOR THE EMBASSY ON ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE DROC, AND IT WOULD BE SURPRISING TO </p><p>FIND HIS REPLACEMENT AS OPEN AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.  (HE </p><p>HINTED THAT HIS UNNAMED SUCCESSOR\'S ACCESS TO FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS HIS OWN.)  WE </p><p>CAN BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THE GOZ IS PREPARING TO </p><p>WITHDRAW FROM THE DROC.  HIS REASONING TRACKS WELL WITH </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AND WHAT OTHER SOURCES HAVE BEEN TELLING </p><p>US.  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT MENTION IT, EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, </p><p>SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND MUGABE\'S RIGHT-HAND MAN IN THE </p><p>DROC, TOLD US HE WAS VISITING KINSHASA DURING THE SAME </p><p>WEEK AS HAMADZIRIPI, PRESUMABLY TO APPLY PRESSURE ON </p><p>KABILA TO ABIDE BY LUSAKA (SEE REFTEL).

EVEN A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DROC </p><p>WOULD HELP PLUG THE DISASTROUS LEAK IN THE GOZ\'S SINKING </p><p>FINANCIAL SHIP AND SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO DOMESTIC AND </p><p>FOREIGN OBSERVERS ALIKE THAT THE DROC DRAIN ON ZIMBABWE </p><p>WILL COME TO AN END SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DAO COMMENT: THE WITHDRAWAL OF HALF OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S TROOPS CURRENTLY IN THE DROC SOUNDS CORRECT, </p><p>BUT THIS WOULD LIKELY BE DONE OVER A SIX- TO 12-MONTH </p><p>TIMEFRAME.   BEFORE ZIMBABWE RETURNS ITS TROOPS FROM THE </p><p>DROC, THERE WILL NEED TO BE AN APPARATUS IN PLACE TO </p><p>OVERSEE ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC INTERESTS (MINING AND </p><p>FORESTRY CONCESSIONS, FOR EXAMPLE).  ONE OPTION BEING </p><p>CONSIDERED IS TO RETIRE THE ZDF\'S TROOPS IN THE DROC </p><p>FROM THE MILITARY AND GIVE THEM SECURITY JOBS TO PROTECT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S DROC CONCESSIONS.  THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH TWO </p><p>MAIN OBJECTIVES:  FIRST, TO HAVE A FORCE STILL IN THE </p><p>DROC TO PROTECT ZIMBABWE\'S INTERESTS, AND SECOND, TO </p><p>ALLOW THE OVERALL MILITARY STRUCTURE TO BE DOWNSIZED. </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS LOOKING AT DOWNSIZING THE ZDF\'S CURRENT </p><p>FORCE OF 34,000 TO 25,000.   ADDITIONALLY, BRINGING A </p><p>PORTION OF THE MILITARY BACK FROM THE DROC WOULD ENABLE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE TO REINFORCE DISTRICTS THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>LOST IN THE JUNE ELECTIONS.  OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO </p><p>ZANU-PF ARE THE CITIES OF BULAWAYO, KWEKWE, AND MUTARE, </p><p>WHOSE GARRISONS ARE VIRTUALLY EMPTY FROM THE DROC </p><p>DEPLOYMENT.  ALSO, WE WOULD SPECULATE THAT THE SPECIAL </p><p>ASSISTANT WITH AMBASSADORIAL RANK WHOM HAMADZIRIPI DID </p><p>NOT NAME COULD BE LTG CHIWENGA, CURRENTLY THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>NATIONAL ARMY COMMANDER; HE IS RUMORED TO BE RETIRING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05464  02 OF 02  271612Z </p><p>SOON FOR AN AMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENT.  LTG CHIWENGA HAS </p><p>BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DROC FROM THE BEGINNING AND WOULD </p><p>MAKE A GOOD WATCHDOG FOR ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BUSINESS </p><p>INTERESTS THERE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
