(C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD MET FOR HALF AN HOUR WITH </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR EUROPE </p><p>AND THE AMERICAS JONATHAN WUTAWUNASHE AT THE LATTER\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05362  251504Z </p><p>REQUEST SEPTEMBER 25.  WUTAWUNASHE GOT TO THE POINT </p><p>QUICKLY, ASKING WHETHER "THE DAILY NEWS" HAD STATED </p><p>CORRECTLY THE OBJECT OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT TO PIUS </p><p>NCUBE, THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF BULAWAYO, ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 21. THE ARTICLE STATED THAT "MCDONALD\'S VISIT </p><p>WAS TO LOBBY NCUBE TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE </p><p>REGION TO ACCEPT THE BILL (ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT)." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD RESPONDED THAT THE NEWSPAPER </p><p>ARTICLE\'S ACCOUNT WAS "NOT CORRECT, AND THAT THE </p><p>REPORTER WAS UNPROFESSIONAL."  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT </p><p>HE HAD MET WITH THE ARCHBISHOP, BUT THE SUBJECT OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT WAS NOT RAISED.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>WOULD NOT DIVULGE WHAT WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>CONVERSATION. THE AMBASSADOR WENT ON TO STATE THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SHOULD NOT LET ITSELF BE SEIZED </p><p>BY ITS OWN PARANOIA, BUT RATHER TAKE TO HEART THE BILL\'S </p><p>SERIOUS MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: "THE DAILY NEWS\'" FABRICATED ARTICLE </p><p>THAT APPEARED ON SEPTEMBER 25, WAS CUT FROM WHOLE CLOTH. </p><p>THE REPORTER RECEIVED NO INFORMATION EITHER FROM </p><p>OURSELVES OR THE ARCHBISHOP.  IF SOMEONE IN THE </p><p>ARCHBISHOP\'S OFFICE TIPPED OFF THE PRESS TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CALL IN ORDER TO HELP THE ARCHBISHOP, WHO </p><p>HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DEATH THREATS, HE OR SHE DID </p><p>THE WRONG THING.  THE FACT THAT THE AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PARANOIA IS IN OVERDRIVE.  WE DO NOT INTEND </p><p>TO PUBLICIZE THIS MATTER FURTHER, BUT WILL REGISTER OUR </p><p>UNHAPPINESS ABOUT THE STORY WITH THE NEWSPAPER\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05362  251504Z </p><p>MANAGING EDITOR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
