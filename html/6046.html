Brasilia 606 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  The Brazilian economy grew a modest 1.5% </p><p>in 2002, as a strong export performance offset falling </p><p>domestic consumption and investment.  The Central Bank </p><p>expects growth will reach 2.8% in 2003, led by trade and </p><p>agriculture and a modest increase in domestic consumption </p><p>and manufacturing.  Many market analysts are more </p><p>skeptical, though, noting that with high interest rates </p><p>there are few new sources of growth that will drive </p><p>economic expansion.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2002 Rescued by Trade </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Brazilian economy grew modestly in 2002, 1.5%, </p><p>while GDP growth per capita was almost flat, 0.2%.  These </p><p>results are almost the same as in 2001 (GDP growth of 1.4%, </p><p>per capita GDP growth of 0.1%). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Growth was spread relatively evenly across the four </p><p>quarters in seasonally adjusted terms, although the fourth </p><p>quarter turned in a relatively impressive year-on-year </p><p>result, 3.4%, in part because production in the the last </p><p>quarter of 2001 was depressed because of the energy crisis. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) For the year, agriculture registered the strongest </p><p>growth, 5.8%, while industry and services both came in at </p><p>1.5%.  However, industry did have a strong fourth quarter, </p><p>growing at 6.9%. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) A more striking picture about the performance of </p><p>the Brazilian economy in 2002 comes from the demand side. </p><p>For the year, family consumption (-0.7%) and business </p><p>investment (-4.1%) both fell, while the government </p><p>increased by a modest 1.0%.  (Business investment finally </p><p>began to pick up in the fourth quarter, growing 4.2%.) </p><p>However, the real force behind what growth that took place </p><p>was on the trade side, with exports up 7.8% and imports </p><p>down 12.8%.  Together, these two factors contributed 2.8 </p><p>percentage points towards growth, offsetting falling </p><p>domestic consumption and investment. </p><p> </p><p>What\'s in Store for 2003? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to the Central Bank\'s survey of market </p><p>analysts, the average GDP growth forecast for 2003 is 2%. </p><p>However, that average disguises a wide range of views on </p><p>2003 growth potential.  In early February, Luis Fernando </p><p>Lopes of JPMorgan increased his forecast to 2.5%, arguing </p><p>that the strong performance by the trade sector should </p><p>continue to pull the economy along, while underplaying the </p><p>impact of interest rate increases, saying that they have </p><p>little impact on the average consumer.  Rodrigo Azevedo of </p><p>Credit Suisse First Boston, on the other hand, estimates </p><p>that growth will only be 1.0% for the year.  He allows that </p><p>the trade sector should be strong, but asserts that it will </p><p>be the only factor for growth, while domestic consumption </p><p>and investment will be suppressed by tight fiscal and </p><p>monetary policy.  Andrei Spacov of Unibanco lowered his </p><p>forecast for 2003 from 2.0% to 1.5% because of the recent </p><p>tightening of monetary policy (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Econoff discussed 2003 growth prospects with </p><p>Altamir Lopes, Chief Economist at the Central Bank.  Lopes </p><p>defended the Central Bank\'s 2.8% growth projection as </p><p>realistic.  He said the projection is based on continued </p><p>growth for agriculture.  He noted that the industrial </p><p>sector had been growing for seven months, and the 2003 </p><p>projection does not call for additional acceleration but </p><p>assumes the sector will maintain its reasonable performance </p><p>from the last quarter of 2002 (2.4% growth).  Lopes added </p><p>that that two subsectors, petroleum and electricity, should </p><p>grow rapidly, providing an additional impetus for overall </p><p>growth.  He noted that the construction sector has begun to </p><p>pick up as well, and the Central Bank forecast assumes it </p><p>will continue to grow at a relatively modest 2.4%. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) On the demand side, Lopes expects continued </p><p>strong growth due to exports and import substitution.  (He </p><p>noted that the impact of growing exports has been magnified </p><p>domestically since, with the depreciation of the real, </p><p>dollar-denominated trade has increased its weight in the </p><p>Brazilian economy.)  Lopes argued that family consumption </p><p>should pick up even with suppressed real wages, pointing to </p><p>increased income in the agricultural sector, increased one- </p><p>time disbursements of unemployment benefits (FGTS), and </p><p>increased social payments under the Lula administration. </p><p>And Lopes expects that certain industries will continue to </p><p>invest, noting that some export industries are operating at </p><p>capacity or are anticipating continued growth. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Lopes ended by noting that the 2.8% projection </p><p>assumes little economic fallout from a quick war in the </p><p>Middle East.  He said a protracted war might reduce growth </p><p>by around 0.3 percentage points. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Comment.  Lopes highlights a range of factors </p><p>that could sustain growth in 2003, although we would be </p><p>surprised if the economy expands 2.8% this year.  Given </p><p>that domestic consumption and investment has been flat for </p><p>two years because of economic turbulence, we suspect that </p><p>there is significant pent-up demand that could be released </p><p>if the overall economic environment is benign.  That is a </p><p>big if, however, given uncertainties about a war with Iraq </p><p>and the ability of the Lula government to deliver economic </p><p>reform.  On top of that, the government is going to have to </p><p>maintain tight monetary and fiscal policy.  Therefore we </p><p>expect that growth is more likely to be in the range of </p><p>1.5-2.0%, and at most around 2.5% if everything breaks the </p><p>right way. </p><p> </p><p>Goughnour </p><p></p></div>
