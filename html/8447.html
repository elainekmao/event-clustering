On Razali, he </p><p>said it was up to the Special Envoy to decide whether he came </p><p>to Burma June 6 as planned, but noted that he could not </p><p>guarantee that Razali would see Aung San Suu Kyi, if he came. </p><p> Razali may be willing to continue his mission on those </p><p>terms, but we don\'t see the point. So long as she remains in </p><p>detention and the NLD offices remain closed, Razali should </p><p>stay away. In the meanwhile, we plan to send officers to </p><p>Depeyin to see what we can determine regarding events there. </p><p>It may be impossible to re-assemble any clear picture of </p><p>events on May 31, but we believe it is essential to show our </p><p>interest and concern.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Government\'s Briefing </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) At a briefing for diplomats on June 3, Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Khin Maung Win provided a rehash of the government\'s </p><p>side of the story regarding the recent riot in Depeyin. </p><p>According to the Minister, the events in Depeyin were </p><p>provoked by the youth wing of the NLD and militant Buddhist </p><p>monks who had affiliated themselves with the NLD.  He said </p><p>that there had been a variety of incidents leading up to the </p><p>riot on May 31.  He asserted that a 21-year old girl had been </p><p>run down in Shwebo and, in Indaw on May 26, NLD supporters </p><p>had attacked villagers with "sticks, iron pipes and bicycle </p><p>chains."  In Depeyin on May 31, the NLD convoy, consisting of </p><p>nine cars and about 40 motorcycles, were stopped by a crowd </p><p>of 5,000 local people about 2 miles outside the town, he </p><p>said.  As the NLD tried to push its way through the crowd, </p><p>fights broke which eventually left four dead and fifty </p><p>hospitalized.  Initially, there were "no Burmese police or </p><p>military forces" on the spot, according to the DepFonMin. </p><p>Security forces from Mon Ywa only arrived about two hours </p><p>after the altercation started.  They secured the situation, </p><p>took Aung San Suu Kyi and her party into "protective </p><p>custody", and took count of the casualties.  The government </p><p>still has not identified all the dead, missing, or injured, </p><p>but says categorically that neither Aung San Suu Kyi nor NLD </p><p>Vice Chairman U Tin Oo were injured. The DepFonMin also </p><p>denied that gunshots were fired during the course of the </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On Aung San Suu Kyi, the Minister said that the </p><p>government had been obliged to  provide "temporary </p><p>protection" for her and her party.  Similarly, the NLD had </p><p>been asked to "temporarily" close their offices throughout </p><p>the country.  The DepFonMin asserted that the government had </p><p>"no animosity or hostility" towards Aung San Suu Kyi, and </p><p>maintained that, for the government, the "greatest nightmare" </p><p>is that some harm might come to her.  However, some of the </p><p>NLD youth had acted "very rashly," and there was "growing </p><p>resentment" against the NLD in Burma.  He also assured </p><p>diplomats that the process of national reconciliation would </p><p>continue and hoped "that the international community will </p><p>understand the situation and not complicate it." </p><p> </p><p>Diplomats Reaction </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Diplomats reacted to brief with incredulity and tough </p><p>questions that focused on Aung San Suu Kyi\'s health and </p><p>circumstances, the situation of the NLD\'s Central Committee </p><p>members, and the government\'s reasons for closing NLD offices </p><p>throughout Burma.  The DepFonMin would not say where Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi was being held, though he did say she was not in the </p><p>notorious Insein prison.  He also said that neither she nor </p><p>any of the other leaders of the NLD would be charged with any </p><p>crime.  When pressed regarding access to ASSK and the other </p><p>NLD detainees by the COM, the British Charge, and the French, </p><p>German and Norwegian Ambassadors, however, he stated flatly </p><p>that "for security reasons," it would not be possible for any </p><p>diplomats to have access to either Aung San Suu Kyi or any of </p><p>the other members of the NLD\'s leadership and gave no time </p><p>frame for the "temporary" detention.  His answer regarding </p><p>the NLD\'s offices was much the same; the offices had been </p><p>closed down as a "temporary measure for security reasons." </p><p>On SE Razali\'s upcoming visit, the DepFonMin said that he had </p><p>been in touch with the Special Envoy on both June 2 and June </p><p>3 but it was entirely up to Razali as to whether he came or </p><p>not.  However, he emphasized that at "his level" (the </p><p>DepFonMin\'s) he could not assure Razali that he could meet </p><p>with Aung San Suu Kyi. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  The DepFonMin also ruled out any international </p><p>investigation of the incident.  Burma, he said, was "very </p><p>conscious of its independence" and would never allow </p><p>foreigners to dictate to it.  When the COM informed the </p><p>DepFonMin that officers form the Embassy were traveling to </p><p>Depeyin on June 4, he was taken off guard, but did not </p><p>indicate that the area would be off limits to travel. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The DepFonMin\'s answers satisfied no one.  The COM was </p><p>emphatic in stating that the GOB\'s credibility on this matter </p><p>was gone, and that the diplomatic community could not be sure </p><p>whether Aung San Suu Kyi and the other NLD members were alive </p><p>or dead.  Without access, no one could verify any part of the </p><p>government\'s story. She also questioned the credibility of </p><p>the government\'s account of the events in Depeyin and </p><p>insisted that names of the dead should be released.  The </p><p>British noted that, in large measure, the GOB\'s own </p><p>credibility and reputation was at stake - if we could not </p><p>verify the government\'s statements, others would undoubtedly </p><p>question them.  The Italian Ambassador similarly expressed </p><p>his concern and that of the EU regarding the situation and </p><p>read a statement from the EU. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) This was a deservedly brutal session for Khin Maung </p><p>Win.  His account convinced no one.  In fact, his </p><p>presentation left behind the impression that the government </p><p>have stage-managed recent events in order to end the latest </p><p>tentative political liberalization episode in Burma, and to </p><p>scuttle the UN-sponsored dialogue process.  It is hard </p><p>otherwise to understand how Aung San Suu Kyi\'s party could </p><p>have run into a mob of 5,000 anti-NLD agitators at night on a </p><p>country road without any government security present.  The </p><p>government\'s actions since then in closing all NLD offices </p><p>and holding all senior NLD leadership incommunicado also </p><p>suggest that the government has a broader agenda than simply </p><p>assuring internal security.  Burmese government spokesmen </p><p>will deny this, as the DepFonMin did in the briefing today, </p><p>but the government\'s seeming indifference to the strong </p><p>international reaction to the latest events, and to Razali\'s </p><p>mission, suggests that neither political transition nor </p><p>international opinion carries any weight with them at the </p><p>moment.  Internal security and keeping the junta\'s power </p><p>intact comes first, even if that means political repression </p><p>and international condemnation. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT:  For the United States and other countries </p><p>which have focused their policy on the goal of a transition </p><p>to democracy and increased respect for human rights and the </p><p>rule of law, these latest developments are powerfully </p><p>negative.  The GOB may restore ASSK\'s liberty and may allow </p><p>the NLD to re-open its offices, but there is little doubt </p><p>that it will do so only on terms that make explicit that </p><p>political liberty will always be subordinate to the internal </p><p>security concerns of the regime in Burma.  Razali may be </p><p>willing to continue his mission on those terms, but we don\'t </p><p>see the point, unless there is some clarification of the </p><p>government\'s intention regarding the teatment and liberties </p><p>of the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi.  So long as she remains in </p><p>detention and the NLD offices remain closed, Razali should </p><p>stay away.  End Comment. </p><p>9. (U) We are sending two officers and an FSN employee to </p><p>Depeyin to see what we can determine on the ground regarding </p><p>events there.  It may be impossible to re-assemble any clear </p><p>picture of events on May 31, but we believe it is essential </p><p>to show our interest and concern. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
