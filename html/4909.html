This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 31, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  MILITARY BUILD-UP ALONG IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Deployment along the Turkey-Iraq </p><p>border continues prior to the possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq.  Turkish military continues </p><p>with infrastructure works in the region in </p><p>preparation for the operation.  Within this </p><p>framework, additional materials and equipment are </p><p>being transferred to both sides of the border. </p><p>Military units sent to the border area have settled </p><p>in trailer parks and pilgrimage facilities near </p><p>Silopi\'s (Sirnak) Habur border gate.  In addition, </p><p>civil defense directorates in Sirnak and Hakkari </p><p>provinces are working on measures to be taken </p><p>against a possible influx of refugees (from Iraq). </p><p>Evrensel quoted the Elazig Civil Defense Director, </p><p>Celal Cihan, as stating that (Elazig\'s) underground </p><p>shelters were not secure against chemical and </p><p>biological weapons (attacks). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  INCREASED DISTURBANCE IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  Disturbance among people in </p><p>Hakkari, a Turkish province on the Iraqi border, </p><p>has reached a peak due to the possible U.S. attack </p><p>against Iraq, with residents taking intense anti- </p><p>war security measures.  Some residents have sealed </p><p>their windows and doors with nylon against chemical </p><p>weapons attacks.  Hakkari people are concerned </p><p>about their relatives in Iraq as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  AKGUNDUZ CAN NO LONGER BECOME MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Fadil Akgunduz, who was elected a </p><p>Member of Parliament from Siirt in the November 3 </p><p>parliamentary elections, lost his eligibility to </p><p>run for parliamentary elections because the Supreme </p><p>Court upheld a two-year prison term and a fine of </p><p>TL 750 million (approx. USD 455) given to him by an </p><p>Istanbul court for violation of the "Capital Market </p><p>Law."  Sought for swindling for a long time, </p><p>Akgunduz entered the Parliament after November 3, </p><p>gaining parliamentary immunity.  However, he lost </p><p>his standing and immunity when the elections in </p><p>Siirt were cancelled.  Then, he was arrested and </p><p>ordered to remain in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  INVESTIGATION AGAINST ELECTRICITY THIEVES </p><p>(Turkiye)  The Turkish Electricity Distribution </p><p>Corporation (TEDAS) Diyarbakir Directorate launched </p><p>an investigation against 13 TEDAS employees who had </p><p>been using electricity illegally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.
