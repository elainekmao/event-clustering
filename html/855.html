<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 007350 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMCONSUL DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, AF, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: TEHRAN SEES TALEBAN AS U.S. TOOL AGAINST IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY: DAVID PEARCE, CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>DUBAI.  REASON: 1.6, X6 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ABDUL HAQ, A FORMER LEADER OF THE AFGHAN </p><p>COMMANDERS SHURA, SAYS THE TALEBAN HAVE APPROACHED HIM </p><p>ABOUT SERVING AS FOREIGN MINISTER, BUT HE HAS DECLINED. </p><p>HAQ SAID HE WOULD ONLY ACCEPT SUCH A POSITION IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF A CREDIBLE MEDIATION WHERE HE COULD HELP </p><p>NUDGE THE TALEBAN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  HE SAID </p><p>TEHRAN VIEWED THE TALEBAN AS A U.S. TOOL AIMED AT </p><p>DESTABILIZING IRAN.  HE ALSO FELT THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN WAS DRIVING IRAN AND SUNNI </p><p>EXTREMISTS INTO EACH OTHER\'S ARMS AND IF THIS CONTINUES </p><p>"OUR MAIN EXPORT WILL BE TERRORISM."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A BUSINESS TRIP TO IRAN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CONSUL GENERAL MET IN BOTH MID AND LATE OCTOBER </p><p>WITH ABDUL HAQ, A FORMER LEADER OF THE AFGHANISTAN </p><p>COMMANDERS\' SHURA.  HAQ VISITS DUBAI REGULARLY ON </p><p>BUSINESS AND IN LATE OCTOBER HAD JUST RETURNED FROM </p><p>THREE DAYS IN IRAN.  THE TRIP FOLLOWED A JUNE VISIT TO </p><p>IRAN AIMED AT NEGOTIATING A FUEL OIL PURCHASE (HE CALLED </p><p>IT "FURNACE OIL") FOR AFGHANISTAN, BUT THE DEAL </p><p>REPORTEDLY FELL THROUGH WHEN THE TALEBAN DEMANDED 50 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE SHIPMENT FOR THEIR OWN CONSUMPTION.  ON </p><p>THE SECOND TRIP, HAQ HAD SOUGHT TO ARRANGE A COMMERCIAL </p><p>BUY OF 30,000 TONS FOR DELIVERY TO A CUSTOMER IN THE </p><p>UAE.  CG QUIZZED HIM AS TO WHETHER THE PRODUCT MIGHT BE </p><p>SMUGGLED IRAQI GASOIL.  HAQ REPLIED THAT IT WAS LOW- </p><p>GRADE IRANIAN FUEL OIL, THE BY-PRODUCT OF IRANIAN </p><p>REFINING OPERATIONS, AND NOT THE HIGHER-GRADE IRAQI </p><p>DIESEL OR GASOIL.  HE SAID NOTHING HAD COME OF HIS </p><p>DISCUSSIONS IN IRAN BECAUSE IRANIAN MIDDLEMEN HAD WANTED </p><p>TOO MUCH "COMMISSION" TO MAKE THE PROJECT WORTHWHILE. </p><p>THE MIDDLEMEN APPARENTLY ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE BONYAD- </p><p>E MOSTAZAFAN VA JUNBAZAN, IRAN\'S FOUNDATION FOR THE </p><p>DEPRIVED AND WAR DISABLED, A MASSIVE STATE HOLDING </p><p>COMPANY THAT CONTROLS CONFISCATED ASSETS OF THE SHAH\'S </p><p>REGIME.  HAQ SAID HE MIGHT GO TO TURKMENISTAN TO EXPLORE </p><p>POSSIBILITIES THERE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>TALEBAN PROBE HAQ ON FOREIGN MINISTER\'S JOB </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ABDUL HAQ SAID MANY OF HIS LOCAL COMMANDERS NOW </p><p>HELD PROMINENT POSITIONS WITH THE TALEBAN AND THAT HE </p><p>HAD RECEIVED PROBES FROM THE TALEBAN ABOUT ASSUMING A </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL POSITION LIKE FOREIGN MINISTER. HE SAID HE </p><p>WAS NOT INTERESTED, PREFERRING TO STAY IN PRIVATE </p><p>BUSINESS. HE DIDN\'T LIKE THE TALEBAN, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>HIS SYMPATHIES LAY MORE WITH THEM THAN RABBANI, SAYYAF </p><p>AND MASOOD, WHOM HE TERMED "FUNDAMENTALISTS."  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, HAQ DID NOT RULE OUT ACCEPTING A POSITION </p><p>WITH THE TALEBAN IF IT WERE IN TANDEM WITH A CREDIBLE </p><p>MEDIATION EFFORT UNDERWAY BY A "DISINTERESTED" THIRD </p><p>PARTY.  (COMMENT: HE SEEMED TO HAVE THE U.S., NOT THE </p><p>U.N., IN MIND.  END COMMENT.)  HE SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER </p><p>STEPPING FORWARD IF HE COULD PLAY A USEFUL ROLE IN </p><p>NUDGING THE TALEBAN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FROM THE </p><p>INSIDE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ABDUL HAQ COMMENTED AT ONE POINT THAT TELEVISION </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE TALEBAN HAD BEEN VERY NEGATIVE -- </p><p>MASOOD\'S GAINS WERE GIVEN MORE ATTENTION THAN TALEBAN </p><p>GAINS, AND MASOOD SHELLING OF CIVILIAN AREAS WAS GIVEN </p><p>LESS ATTENTION THAN SIMILAR TALEBAN SHELLING.  CG </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE TALEBAN HAD EARNED A LOT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ILL WILL FROM THEIR TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND </p><p>GROTESQUE PUBLIC MOCKING OF THE BODIES OF NAJIBULLAH AND </p><p>HIS BROTHER.  HAQ ACKNOWLEDGED THIS, SAYING HE HAD MADE </p><p>SOME EFFORT TO MODERATE TALEBAN POLICIES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THOSE REGARDING WOMEN, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  HE SAID THE </p><p>IDEA OF BEING A PUBLIC SPOKESMAN FOR THE TALEBAN WAS ONE </p><p>OF THE REASONS HE WAS SO RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON A JOB LIKE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER.  "I DON\'T AGREE WITH THESE THINGS AND </p><p>I CAN\'T DEFEND THEM," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>HAQ SEES IRAN AND SUNNI EXTREMISTS COMING TOGETHER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENTING ON HIS VISITS TO IRAN, ABDUL HAQ SAID </p><p>THE IRANIANS HATE THE TALEBAN.  HE SAID THEY ARE </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE TALEBAN ARE NOT MERELY CONTROLLED BY </p><p>PAKISTAN, BUT ARE PART OF A SINISTER U.S. DESIGN TO </p><p>DESTABILIZE IRAN.  THE REASONING APPEARS TO BE THAT A </p><p>HARDLINE SUNNI ISLAMIST REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN MIGHT </p><p>APPEAL TO THE LARGE SUNNI ETHNIC MINORITIES THAT INHABIT </p><p>IRAN\'S PERIPHERY, E.G. IN BALUCHISTAN.  HE ALSO SAID </p><p>THAT, LIKE IT OR NOT, THE U.S. WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE </p><p>TALEBAN AMONG AFGHANS.  IF THEY WIN, THE U.S. WILL BE </p><p>SEEN TO GAIN.  IF THEY LOSE, IRAN WILL BE SEEN TO HAVE </p><p>GAINED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ANOTHER THING IRAN DOESN\'T LIKE ABOUT THE </p><p>TALEBAN, HE SAID, IS THAT IT HAS LITTLE PROSPECT OF </p><p>GAINING SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THEM.  NOTING THAT </p><p>IRAN HAD BEEN SUPPORTIVE BOTH OF THE RABBANI GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND THE HAZARA SHIA, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THE AFGHAN CONFLICT WAS HAVING THE </p><p>UNDESIRABLE EFFECT OF DRIVING THE IRANIANS AND SUNNI </p><p>EXTREMISTS TOGETHER.  HE SAID RABBANI, HEKMATYAR ET AL </p><p>HAD OPENED THE DOOR TO EXTREMISTS LIKE OSAMA BIN LADIN </p><p>WHO NEED AN UNSTABLE COUNTRY WITH A WEAK GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>ORDER TO MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT BASE OF OPERATIONS. </p><p>"IF THIS CONTINUES," HE SAID, "OUR MAIN EXPORT WILL BE </p><p>TERRORISM."  HE NOTED THAT THE TALEBAN\'S FOCUS WAS ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BUT IRAN SUPPORTED MASOOD, RABBANI AND </p><p>SAYYAF, WHO HE SAID HAD LINKS TO SUNNI GROUPS WITH AN </p><p>EXTERNAL AGENDA.  HAQ PREDICTED EXCEEDINGLY NEGATIVE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES IF THE COUNTRY WERE DIVIDED ALONG ETHNIC </p><p>PASHTO AND NON-PASHTO, MAINLY TAJIK, LINES.  "IT NEVER </p><p>WAS A PASHTO-TAJIK CONFLICT BEFORE," HE SAID, "BUT IT IS </p><p>BECOMING MORE AND MORE SO." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) HE SAID IRAN IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT A PAKISTAN- </p><p>AFGHANISTAN COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE COMPETING WITH IRAN FOR </p><p>ACCESS TO THE MARKETS OF THE CIS.  IF THE TALIBAN IS </p><p>ABLE TO RESTORE STABILITY TO AFGHANISTAN, HAQ EXPLAINED, </p><p>IMPORTERS TO THE CIS MIGHT SHIP THEIR GOODS THROUGH </p><p>PAKISTANI PORTS TO LINK WITH ROAD NETWORKS THROUGH </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, TAKING BUSINESS AWAY FROM THE IRANIAN ROUTE </p><p>THAT BEGINS AT BANDAR ABBAS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>RUSSIA: DELIBERATELY SOWING CHAOS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) HAQ SAID HE WAS DISTURBED BY THE IMMEDIACY AND </p><p>STERNNESS OF THE RUSSIAN RESPONSE TO THE TALEBAN VICTORY </p><p>AT KABUL, INCLUDING THE CONVENING OF A SECURITY </p><p>CONFERENCE OF THE BORDERING CIS STATES.  MOSCOW WAS </p><p>CLEARLY EAGER TO USE THE SITUATION TO SERVE ITS OWN </p><p>STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN THE CIS, HE SAID.  HAQ MAINTAINED </p><p>THAT AFTER THE SOVIET PULLOUT FROM AFGHANISTAN, MOSCOW </p><p>HAD CYNICALLY FUNDED OPPOSING TAJIK GROUPS TO SOW CHAOS </p><p>IN POST-SOVIET AFGHANISTAN AND JUSTIFY CONTINUED RUSSIAN </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE ON THE TAJIK-AFGHAN BORDER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>NO ONE CAN WIN, SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR NEGOTIATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ASKED ABOUT THE FUTURE, ABDUL HAQ CHARACTERIZED </p><p>THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN AS A "GREAT BIG MESS". </p><p>HOWEVER, THE ONE POSITIVE ELEMENT WAS THAT NO ONE WAS IN </p><p>A POSITION TO WIN.  WHEN ANY GROUP HAS THE ADVANTAGE, IT </p><p>IS UNWILLING TO NEGOTIATE SERIOUSLY.  RIGHT NOW, THE </p><p>FORCES ARE SOMEWHAT IN BALANCE, WHICH OPENS SOME </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION.  HE SAID THE </p><p>"FUNDAMENTALISTS" IN PARTICULAR (RABBANI, MASOOD ET AL) </p><p>ARE UNDER PRESSURE.  IT WAS THESE GROUPS WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>THE PRIME MOVERS IN SCUTTLING PREVIOUS UNITY PLANS, IN </p><p>BLOCKING THE RETURN OF ZAHIR SHAH, AND IN UNDERMINING </p><p>VARIOUS U.N. MEDIATION EFFORTS.  BUT FACED WITH A CHOICE </p><p>BETWEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, A UNITY GOVERNMENT UNDER THE </p><p>MANTLE OF ZAHIR SHAH AND A GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BY THE </p><p>TALEBAN, THEY WOULD OPT FOR ZAHIR SHAH.  "FOR THEM IT </p><p>WOULD BE THE LEAST WORST," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) DESPITE HAQ\'S PESSIMISM ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT, HE </p><p>APPEARED HOPEFUL THAT THE U.S. MIGHT STEP UP TO A MORE </p><p>ACTIVE ROLE.  IN SUCH CASE, HE MADE CLEAR, HE AND OTHERS </p><p>LIKE HIM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY MIGHT BE WILLING </p><p>TO ALSO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE PART.  BUT FOR NOW, HE\'LL </p><p>STICK TO PRIVATE BUSINESS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LITT </p><p></p></div>
