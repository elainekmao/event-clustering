ALTHOUGH HCMC VIDEO STALLS ARE STILL FILLED WITH CHEAP </p><p>VERSIONS OF HOLLYWOOD FAVORITES, LOCAL IPR AUTHORITIES ARE </p><p>FINALLY FORCING ONE TRADEMARK-STEALING ESTABLISHMENT, "THE </p><p>HARD ROCK CAFE," TO CHANGE ITS NAME - MAYBE.  THIS COMES </p><p>AFTER THE RIGHT-HOLDER HAD BEEN WORKING WITH A LOCAL LAW </p><p>FIRM FOR MORE THAN A YEAR TO GET THE PLACED CLOSED DOWN. </p><p>THE ATTORNEY INVOLVED IN THE CASE BELIEVED THAT POST QUERIES </p><p>ABOUT THE CASE AND THE RECENT VISIT BY USG REPS (REFTEL) </p><p>FOCUSING ON IPR ISSUES SPURRED LOCAL AUTHORITIES INTO </p><p>ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>2. LAST WEEK SAIGON\'S LOCAL VERSION OF "THE HARD ROCK CAFE" </p><p>WAS VISITED BY THE INSPECTORATE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT (DOSTE), ONE OF THE </p><p>MYRIAD AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IPR ENFORCEMENT IN HCMC. </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES REMOVED AND DESTROYED THE ESTABLISHMENT\'S </p><p>"HARD ROCK CAFE" OUTDOOR SIGNAGE - ONE NEON SIGN WAS </p><p>DESTROYED UNDER THE BOOT OF THE COMPLAINING LAWYER INVITED </p><p>TO THE SCENE - AND ORDERED REMOVAL OF ALL HARD ROCK CAFE- </p><p>LABELED DECOR FROM THE PREMISES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PROBLEM APPEARS FAR FROM SETTLED, HOWEVER.  THE </p><p>COMPLAINING ATTORNEYS SENT A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO THE </p><p>SCENE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THE SIGNS STILL GONE, BUT THAT </p><p>EVERYTHING ELSE WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL.  THE LOGO </p><p>MERCHANDISE, T-SHIRTS, KEY RINGS, ETC. WHICH HAD </p><p>MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE RAID, WERE BACK ON SALE. </p><p>THE STAFF STILL ANSWERS THE PHONE "HARD ROCK CAF." THE </p><p>INTERIOR DECOR HAS NOT CHANGED, AND HARD ROCK CAFE-LABELED </p><p>MENUS ARE STILL IN USE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00602  171002Z </p><p>4.  THE LOCAL ATTORNEY PLANS ANOTHER MEETING WITH DOSTE </p><p>OFFICIALS TO ONCE AGAIN PRESS FOR MORE SERIOUS ACTION.  THE </p><p>ATTORNEY ADVISES THAT THE STORY (WITH ALL OF ITS IRONIC </p><p>TWISTS) IS BEING PICKED UP BY THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST </p><p>AND THE BBC.  POST WILL FOLLOW UP WITH DOSTE TO EXPRESS </p><p>CONTINUED INTEREST IN THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
