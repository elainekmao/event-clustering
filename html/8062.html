Minister Guler voiced </p><p>hope that the U.S. will open the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, </p><p>and finalize the BTC and Shah Sea projects soon.  Ambassador </p><p>Pearson said that the U.S. wanted to see the Shah Sea </p><p>project tied to the BTC, and assured Guler that the Haifa </p><p>route could not be an alternative to the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline, papers note.  Pearson also asked for support for </p><p>removal of UN economic sanctions on Iraq which will </p><p>accelerate oil distribution from Yumurtalik, Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wolfowitz: Deputy Secretary of Defense, Wolfowitz denied to </p><p>having urged Ankara to apologize in his interview with CNN- </p><p>Turk last week.  Papers quote him as saying that .  `What I </p><p>said was Turkey should see that it erred in grasping the </p><p>situation in Iraq, and that this failure should have been </p><p>discussed.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Berlusconi: Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose </p><p>country is due to assume the EU term presidency in July, </p><p>says Turkey could join the bloc as early as 2007 with </p><p>Romania and Bulgaria, reports say.  `Even in case of no </p><p>solution, the Cyprus issue should not hinder Turkey\'s EU </p><p>accession.  A divided Cyprus should not have joined the EU,\' </p><p>Berlusconi said.  He also vowed, in his talks with President </p><p>Bush during his upcoming visit to the U.S., to press for </p><p>Turkey getting a share in Iraq\'s rebuilding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TOBB hopes for a share in Iraq: In Washington for talks with </p><p>the State Department and IMF officials, Turkey\'s Union of </p><p>Chambers (TOBB) Chairman Rifat Hisarciklioglu voiced </p><p>expectation that the U.S. will not block Turkish firms from </p><p>getting jobs in post-war Iraq, all dailies and TV networks </p><p>report.  Despite some recent strains, economic cooperation </p><p>between U.S. and Turkey must continue advancing, </p><p>Hisarciklioglu said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IISS report on Turkey: All media report on the London-based </p><p>Institute for International Strategic Studies\' (IISS) annual </p><p>report said Turkey\'s military might take power in the face </p><p>of fundamentalist moves by the AKP government, all papers </p><p>report.  TGS will first try non-military means to prevent </p><p>radical attempts by AKP, but will not hesitate to intervene </p><p>directly at a critical stage even under the risk of possible </p><p>reaction from the Western world, the report emphasized.  The </p><p>IISS report sees the deadlock in Cyprus as a hindrance to </p><p>Turkey\'s EU membership, and notes that EU members Germany </p><p>and France have been upset about the U.S. support for </p><p>Ankara\'s EU drive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>`Repentance Law\': TGS is worried that a `Repentance Law\' </p><p>drafted by the government might help PKK/KADEK\'s </p><p>politicization attempts, "Cumhuriyet" reports.  Targeting </p><p>mainly the militia cadres of the PKK/KADEK in Northern Iraq, </p><p>the draft brings cuts in penalties, and some social </p><p>rehabilitation help to defectors.  However, the government </p><p>is acting carefully to avoid inciting anger among relatives </p><p>of terror victims, the report says. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Powell visit/Riyadh bombings </p><p>b) Iraqi rebuilding </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The roots of terror" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (5/14): </p><p>"Trying to find a reason or excuse on terrorist acts is not </p><p>only a dangerous thing, but also a meaningless effort.  The </p><p>best way of eliminating terrorism is to be able to take </p><p>proper measures.  However, the measures and ways of the Bush </p><p>administration in handling Middle Eastern-based terrorism </p><p>seem to be providing no results at all.  One of the reasons </p><p>for the failure of coping with terrorism stems from the </p><p>perception of US decision makers.  The overall intention </p><p>might be different, but the US decision mechanism continues </p><p>to draw a direct link between Islam and terrorism. </p><p>Therefore those with evil minds find this perception very </p><p>facilitative for their executing terror.  They easily find </p><p>volunteers to carry out their dark aims.  It is like a </p><p>vicious circle.  The more a parallel is made between Islam </p><p>and terror, the more the terrorists find ways for their </p><p>goals to be achieved. . This is the time to think about </p><p>finding other ways to handle terrorism on a global scale. </p><p>One of them might be the US determination to end injustices </p><p>globally." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The return of SCIRI leader to Iraq" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (5/14): </p><p>"The return of Hakem to Iraq is a significant step in the </p><p>restructuring of Iraq.  He is one of the major figures in </p><p>his SCIRI leadership capacity and he comes with enough </p><p>influence to have a say in the future of Iraq. . If he </p><p>manages to unite all three Iraqi Shiite groups under his </p><p>leadership, which might be his goal, Iraq\'s political future </p><p>will certainly center around what he says and what he does." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
