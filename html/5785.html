<p>UNCLAS ROME 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TAREQ AZIZ\'S VISIT TO ROME - FINAL REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. MILAN 105 </p><p>     B. ROME 619 </p><p>     C. ROME 559 </p><p>     D. MILAN 89 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00657  181609Z </p><p>     E. SECSTATE 36445 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: TAREQ AZIZ\'S VISIT TO ROME DID LITTLE TO </p><p>CHANGE THE GOI\'S FIRM STAND ON IRAQ.  AS REQUESTED IN REF E, </p><p>PM BERLUSCONI DID NOT MEET AZIZ.  FM FRATTINI SENT A TOUGH </p><p>MESSAGE TO AZIZ IN PERSON AND IN PUBLIC ON IRAQ\'S NEED TO </p><p>COOPERATE IMMEDIATELY, FULLY, AND ACTIVELY WITH THE UN </p><p>WEAPONS INSPECTORS AND TO SHOW "DEFINITIVE PROOF OF THE </p><p>DISARMAMENT REQUESTED BY THE UN."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FM FRATTINI MET IRAQ\'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TAREQ </p><p>AZIZ IN ROME FEB. 14.  THE MFA, WHICH UNDERSCORED THE FACT </p><p>THAT AZIZ WAS NOT INVITED TO ROME BY THE GOI BUT BY THE BEATO </p><p>ANGELICO FOUNDATION (A FRANCISCAN ORDER), ISSUED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING TOUGH-WORDED STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE MEETING. </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>"DEPUTY PM AZIZ, WHO REQUESTED THE MEETING, WAS REMINDED BY </p><p>FM FRATTINI THAT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ARE A SERIOUS </p><p>THREAT TO THE PEACE AND SECURITY OF THE WORLD.  ITALY </p><p>SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO MAINTAIN </p><p>PEACE AND SECURITY.  FM FRATTINI UNDERLINED THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>TOTAL AND EFFECTIVE DISARMAMENT OF THE IRAQI ARSENAL OF </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN </p><p>ITALY\'S STANCE WITH REGARD TO IRAQ, WHICH FOR MANY YEARS HAS </p><p>DEFAULTED ON THE OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS FOLLOWING THE INVASION OF KUWAIT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>UN RESOLUTION 1441 AND IN HARMONY WITH THE OTHER MEMBER </p><p>STATES OF THE EU, ITALY URGES THE IRAQI AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>ACTIVELY PROVIDE THE UN INSPECTORS WITH THE DEFINITIVE PROOF </p><p>OF THE DISARMAMENT REQUESTED BY THE UN.  TIME IS RUNNING OUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00657  181609Z </p><p>FOR IRAQ TO MAKE UP FOR ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND FAILURE TO </p><p>PURSUE THE PEACEFUL SOLUTION WHICH ITALY DESIRES.  THE IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT NOW HAS THE CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY OF OFFERING THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALL DUE COOPERATION."  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) NOT ONLY BERLUSCONI\'S COALITION GOVERNMENT, BUT ALSO </p><p>ROME\'S MAYOR VELTRONI, A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION, HAD TOUGH </p><p>WORDS FOR AZIZ.  VELTRONI CANCELED HIS FEB. 16 MEETING WITH </p><p>AZIZ AFTER AZIZ REFUSED TO ANSWER A QUESTION BY AN ISRAELI </p><p>CORRESPONDENT IN A PRESS CONFERENCE FEB. 14.  VELTRONI SAID </p><p>THAT ROME IS A CITY WHERE THERE IS "ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR </p><p>DIALOGUE AND CIVIL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS."  HE ADDED: "YOUR </p><p>COUNTRY, MR. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, MUST COMPLY WITH ALL THE </p><p>UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND MUST COOPERATE FULLY WITH </p><p>THE INSPECTORS.  IN ADDITION, IT MUST FIND THE PATH OF </p><p>RESPECT OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE AND OF DEMOCRACY." </p><p>INFORMAL READ-OUTS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER OPPOSITION MEETINGS </p><p>WITH AZIZ SUGGESTED THAT OTHERS OF HIS CENTER-LEFT </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS ALSO UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR IRAQ TO COMPLY </p><p>FULLY WITH UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) EMBASSY PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO CHARLES FORREST IN </p><p>ARRANGING FOR MEETINGS WITH ITALIAN JOURNALISTS AND </p><p>POLITICIANS DURING AZIZ\'S TRIP TO ROME.  (NOTE: FORREST, AN </p><p>AMCIT AND A FORMER FSO, IS THE CEO OF INDICT, A LONDON-BASED </p><p>NGO THAT WORKS ON BRINGING SADDAM HUSSEIN AND TOP REGIME </p><p>OFFICIALS TO JUSTICE.  END NOTE.)  FORREST MET WITH SENATE </p><p>PRESIDENT PERA FEB. 14 AND PROVIDED EVIDENCE TO HIM SHOWING </p><p>THAT HUSSEIN AND HIS REGIME, INCLUDING AZIZ, HAVE COMMITTED </p><p>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH FORREST, PERA TOLD JOURNALISTS: "FORREST GAVE ME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00657  181609Z </p><p>DOCUMENTS CONTAINING SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME: CRIMES COMMITTED WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS, HOMICIDES, </p><p>AND TORTURE.  AND IN ALL OF THIS DEPUTY PM TAREQ AZIZ SEEMS </p><p>TO BE INVOLVED AS WELL."  ON FEB. 14, FORREST AND HIS ITALIAN </p><p>ATTORNEY, FABIO GALIANI, FILED A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST </p><p>AZIZ FOR GENOCIDE, WAR CRIMES, AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, </p><p>BASED ON ARTICLE 10 OF THE ITALIAN PENAL CODE, TO THE PUBLIC </p><p>PROSECUTOR OF ROME, AND ASKED FOR AZIZ TO BE ARRESTED WHILE </p><p>IN ROME.  THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.  AZIZ LEFT ROME FEB. 17 TO </p><p>RETURN TO BAGHDAD. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00657 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
