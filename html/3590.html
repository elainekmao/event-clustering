<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Needed: sustainable political </p><p>      development" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its August 27 editorial to encouraging </p><p>      African leaders attending the Earth Summit in South </p><p>      Africa to "relate the fight against poverty and </p><p>      HIV/AIDS to the development of sustainable political </p><p>      systems."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The World Summit on Sustainable Development </p><p>      (WSSD), opened by President Thabo Mbeki this week will </p><p>      enable many African leaders to exchange ideas on how </p><p>      to fight poverty and HIV/AIDS on the continent.  For </p><p>      Africa it seems that far more important at this stage </p><p>      is the development of sustainable political systems. </p><p>      Many analysts have suggested that as long as African </p><p>      politics are mired in conflict, there will be little </p><p>      time to concentrate on the fight against poverty. </p><p>      They suggested that the `political kingdom\' to which </p><p>      Kwame Nkurumah referred, may still be an unattainable </p><p>      dream for many Africans.  Has Africa had much time to </p><p>      tackle poverty since Ghana became independent in 1957? </p><p>      There have been coups, civil wars, corruption on a </p><p>      grand scale, there has been electoral fraud on a huge </p><p>      scale.  Yet poverty has escalated.  Clearly, what </p><p>      needs urgent attention in Africa today are its </p><p>      political systems.  Democracy has a chance, but is </p><p>      frowned upon by many leaders because it deprives them </p><p>      of the chance to be tribal chiefs they really want. </p><p>      At the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, let\'s hope they </p><p>      can relate the fight against poverty and HIV/AIDS to </p><p>      the development of sustainable political systems as </p><p>      well." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
