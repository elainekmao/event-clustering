(U) The UAE approved the recommendations of the </p><p>International Labour Organization (ILO) on ccupational </p><p>health and safety.  The ILO agreed, in a conference </p><p>last month, to new standards for the prevention of </p><p>biological hazards in the workplace, calling for </p><p>action to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and </p><p>disease among workers. The action plan approved by the </p><p>ILO requires states to guarantee the right to a safe </p><p>and healthy working environment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: The UAE continues to enact domestic </p><p>labor laws that conform with international principles. </p><p>The government understands well that the UAE economy, </p><p>including the laws that regulate the labor market, </p><p>must conform to global standards or it will lag </p><p>behind.  Additionally, Minister of Labor Matar Humaid </p><p>Al-Tayer and Undersecretary Dr. Khalid Al-Khazraji led </p><p>the UAE delegation to Geneva -- a further indication </p><p>of the importance of the ILO Conference to the UAEG </p><p>and its commitment to labor reform. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
