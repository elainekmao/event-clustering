<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001383 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush must tell Mbeki to act decisively </p><p>      on Zimbabwe" the July 8 edition of the independent daily </p><p>      "The Daily News" printed an op-ed by Joseph Whande on page </p><p>      8, in which he urges President George Bush to help resolve </p><p>      the socioeconomic and political impasse in Zimbabwe by </p><p>      encouraging his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki to </p><p>      "uphold internationally accepted mediation practices." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Both George Bush and Thabo Mbeki must be warned </p><p>      not to continue using Zimbabwe as a playground where </p><p>      international norms, laws, human rights and other practices </p><p>      are disregarded at will.  This has to stop and Bush must </p><p>      make it clear to Mbeki that if he does not want to uphold </p><p>      internationally accepted mediation practices, he should </p><p>      leave the Zimbabwean issue to people who would like to </p><p>      resolve the problem. . .Bush must take note that if he </p><p>      relies too much on Mbeki, he will not get anything resolved </p><p>      in Zimbabwe.  He must be reminded that the people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe have long lamented how Mbeki is a stumbling block </p><p>      to our own efforts to correct the bad situation in our </p><p>      country. . .Apart from Mbeki\'s cowardice in </p><p>      confronting Mugabe, what we are seeing is a </p><p>      deliberate policy by South Africa to strengthen </p><p>      their economy at our expense. . .We have a problem </p><p>      here in Zimbabwe and it is not an exaggeration that </p><p>      people are suffering needlessly under our Mugabe. </p><p>      Many would like to see him go.  But if your solution </p><p>      to our problems is the same as the one you applied </p><p>      in Iraq, then please forget it.  We are peace-loving </p><p>      people and we only need the kind of assistance that </p><p>      will make it possible and easier for us to resolve </p><p>      our problems peacefully.  The person you should get </p><p>      tough with is Mbeki.  Make him play his role as </p><p>      responsible regional leader, a role befitting the </p><p>      president of South Africa.  As you talk to our </p><p>      dictators around the continent, please keep in mind </p><p>      that you do not incite us to stand up and fight for </p><p>      our rights then fly back home and watch as we get </p><p>      butchered.  Tackling Africa\'s dictators is a </p><p>      full-time job that needs the participation of the </p><p>      international community. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
