<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002210 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR DCHA/OFDA FOR HAJJAR, HALMREST-SANCHEZ </p><p>  BRYAN, KHANDAGLE AND MARX </p><p>DCHA/FFP FOR LANDIS, BRAUSE, SKORIC AND PETERSEN </p><p>AFR/SA FOR POE AND COPSON </p><p>AFR/SD FOR ISALROW AND WHELAN </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S DELISI AND RAYNOR </p><p>NAIROBI FOR DCHA/OFDA/ARO FOR RILEY, MYER AND SMITH, </p><p>REDSO/ESA/FFP FOR SENYKOFF </p><p>GENEVA PLEASE PASS TO UNOCHA, IFRC </p><p>PRETORIA FOR USAID/DCHA/FFP FOR DISKIN AND FAS HELM </p><p>ROME PLEASE PASS TO FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, US, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE FOOD SWAP AGREEMENT SIGNED </p><p> </p><p>REF: Memorandum of Understanding between </p><p> </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe Ministry of Public Service, </p><p>Labour and Social Welfare and Grain Marketing Board </p><p>with United Nations - World Food Programme executed </p><p>on 16 September 2002 (copy faxed 9/29/02) </p><p> </p><p>1. This is to confirm that the ref. Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding (MOU) for the long-planned swap of </p><p>17,500 Metric Tons (MT) of U.S.-source whole kernel </p><p>corn/maize donated to the World Food Program\'s Emergency </p><p>Operation (EMOP) appeal for Zimbabwe with an equivalent </p><p>amount of corn/maize from Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) </p><p>stocks was finally signed by all concerned parties on </p><p>27 September 2002. [Note:  The final document indicates </p><p>that the GOZ\'s Ministry of Public Service, Labour and </p><p>Social Welfare signed the MOU on 18 September 2002, </p><p>confirming that the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and </p><p>Rural Resettlement\'s parastatal Grain Marketing Board </p><p>was, indeed, the long-standing obstacle to completing </p><p>this agreement.  End Note.]  WFP sources indicate that </p><p>the wheels are already in motion  to implement this </p><p>agreement in a timely manner; however, it is still </p><p>expected that it will take at least several weeks to </p><p>complete. </p><p> </p><p>2. Comment:  The Mission views this as a most welcome, </p><p>albeit late, development in addressing the issue </p><p>surrounding U.S. biotech-derived food aid for Zimbabwe. </p><p>If completed successfully, without major mishap, it </p><p>should help considerably to alleviate fears, build </p><p>mutual confidence and overcome future country (and </p><p>even greater regional) reticence on this issue. </p><p>However, the Mission cautions that as a one-off </p><p>deal, this arrangement does not represent a long-term </p><p>solution to this issue.  Continuing concerns regarding </p><p>the GOZ\'s ability to maintain adequate maize stocks </p><p>suggest that other/additional measures will be required </p><p>to effect a more lasting solution to this issue in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  End Comment. Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
