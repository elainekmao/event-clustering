FPD personnel secured themselves </p><p>within a store and were told by the boy and the store owner </p><p>that the young man was a well-known thief.  Nothing further </p><p>occurred.  In another incident, an Embassy employee was spit </p><p>upon.  RSO raised both incidents with the Ministry of </p><p>Interior.
