<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000896 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, NEA/RA, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  RICHARD PERLE, IRAQ, AND UAE UNSC </p><p>STATEMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO IRAQ CONTINUE TO GENERATE </p><p>PROMINENT COVERAGE IN LOCAL MEDIA.  DUBAI-BASED ENGLISH DAILY </p><p>"GULF NEWS" CARRIED A 2/23 INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD PERLE WHO SAID </p><p>THAT "NO ONE HAS HARMED ARAB INTERESTS AS MUCH AS HE" (IRAQI </p><p>PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN).  EDITORIALS PRAISED THE FRENCH-GERMAN </p><p>POSITION ON IRAQ AND CRITICIZED ARAB DIFFERENCES THAT EMERGED </p><p>DURING THE RECENT MEETING OF ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS IN CAIRO. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON 2/23, ENGLISH-LANGUAGE EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED DAILY "GULF </p><p>NEWS" CARRIED A FULL PAGE INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD PERLE, CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE DEFENSE POLICY BOARD, DURING A RECENT TRIP TO LONDON. </p><p>EXCERPTS INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>"EVEN IF SADDAM WORKED FOR US, IT IS TIME FOR US TO CHUCK HIM </p><p>OUT.  WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING TROOPS OUTSIDE OUR OWN </p><p>TERRITORY JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT.  THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT </p><p>DESIGNED OR DESTINED TO BECOME AN IMPERIAL POWER.  YOU WILL NOT </p><p>FIND ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHERE WE INTERVENED MILITARILY AND SET </p><p>UP A COLONIAL EMPIRE." </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ON U.S. DESIRE FOR IRAQI OIL:  "THE </p><p>ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WILL BE GIVEN BY WHAT WE SHALL SEE VERY </p><p>SOON.  IRAQI OIL BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND WHOEVER IS </p><p>PREPARED TO BUY IT AT WORLD PRICES.  EVEN NOW THE AMERICAN MARKET </p><p>ABSORBS MOST OF IRAQ\'S OIL." </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO "SOME ARABS SEE YOU AS AN ENEMY\':  "THEY ARE </p><p>WRONG.  SADDAM HUSSEIN IS NOT THE SYMBOL OF ARAB DREAMS, HOPES </p><p>AND ASPIRATIONS.  NO ONE HAS HARMED ARAB INTERESTS AS MUCH AS HE </p><p>HAS IN THE PAST FEW DECADES.  ALL THAT I WANT IS FOR ARABS TO BE </p><p>ABLE TO ELECT THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS, HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  ALL </p><p>I WANT IS FOR THE ARABS TO HAVE A ROBUST OPEN MARKET ECONOMY SO </p><p>THAT THEY CAN HAVE A SHARE IN THE FANTASTIC PROSPERITY CREATED BY </p><p>THE NEW GLOBAL ECONOMY." </p><p> </p><p>RESPONDING TO A QUESTION ABOUT POTENTIAL EXILE FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN </p><p>AS MEANS TO AVERT A WAR:  "... WE WILL NOT ACCEPT FUDGE.  WE WILL </p><p>NOT ACCEPT A HALF SOLUTION UNDER WHICH THE IRAQIS WILL END UP </p><p>WITH A LIGHT VERSION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN.  WHAT WE ARE TALKING </p><p>ABOUT IS REGIME CHANGE, NOT A CHANGE OF PERSONNEL.  SADDAM IS </p><p>BOTH THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF AN EVIL SYSTEM THAT HAS BROGHT SO </p><p>MUCH SUFFERING TO THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ.  THAT SYSTEM MUST GO." </p><p> </p><p>DISCUSSING MOVEMENT ON A ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE AGREEMENT: </p><p>"ONCE THE IRAQI SITUATION IS SETTLED, WE CAN MOVE FASTER.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S \'TWO-STATES\' VISION IS ALREADY CLEAR.  WE ALSO HAVE A </p><p>ROAD MAP. WE ARE CONVINVED THAT, WITHOUT THE SETTLEMENT OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISSUE, NEW POLITICAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE ALLEGED U.S. POLICY OF DIPLOMATC"BLACKMAIL </p><p>AND BRIBERY" AGAINST HUNGARY, AFRICAN NATIONS, AND TURKEY, DUBAI- </p><p>BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... RUMORS ARE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC "BLACKMAIL AND BRIBES" POLICY </p><p>INCLUDES RUSSIA AND IS BASED ON U.S. ASSERTIONS THAT SOME CHECHEN </p><p>GROUPS ARE \'TERRORISTS,\' IN RETURN FOR MOSCOW\'S \'COMPLETE </p><p>SILENCE\' REGARDING ANY MILITARY ACTION TOWARDS IRAQ.  WASHINGTON </p><p>IS ALSO USING THIS IMMORAL DIPLOMACY WITH NORTH KOREA.  THE U.S. </p><p>DECIDED TO CONTINUE SENDING AID TO NORTH KOREA IN ORDER TO </p><p>GUARANTEE A NORTH KOREAN SURRENDER OF THEIR ARROGANCE.  THE U.S. </p><p>IS USING THIS DIPLOMACY OF OPENING MORE DOORS OF BLACKMAIL </p><p>TOWARDS OTHER COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE ITS PLANS AGAINST IRAQ.  THIS </p><p>IS AN ERA DURING WHICH PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS ARE BEING TRAMPLED." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE RISING CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF </p><p>THE PACIFIC,  SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>ON 2/23: </p><p> </p><p>"...THIS RISING CONFLICT BETWEEN THE U.S. ON ONE SIDE AND FRANCE </p><p>AND GERMANY ON THE OTHER CONFIRMS WITH NO DOUBT THE VARIANCE </p><p>BETWEEN A POWER SEEKING HEGEMONY AND A POWER SEEKING TO HAVE A </p><p>ROLE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER SINCE THE LATTER REALIZES ALL THE </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL LOSSES THAT MIGHT OCCUR IF IT GIVES IN </p><p>TO U.S. DEMANDS OR ACCEPTS NATO AS A TOOL IN WASHINGTON\'S </p><p>HANDS...  THIS SITUATION MIGHT LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC END, </p><p>ESPECIALLY WHEN AMERICAN GOALS ALIGN WITH THOSE OF ISRAEL, AND </p><p>BOTH START PLANNING A NEW POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY FOR THE REGION, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO IMPOSING THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS IN THE </p><p>REGION WHICH WILL DEFINITELY PUT AN END TO ALL ARAB ISSUES AND </p><p>AMBITIONS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE ARAB SUMMIT RECENTLY POSTPONED TO THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF MARCH, "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/22: </p><p> </p><p>"...THE ARAB LEAGUE SPOKESMAN HAS INDICATED THAT THE AGENDA FOR </p><p>THE UPCOMING ARAB SUMMIT INCLUDES \'A MYSTERIOUS ITEM\' LEAVING </p><p>ROOM FOR SPECULATION.  SOME SAY THAT THIS ITEM IS THE SENDING OF </p><p>AN ARAB DELEGATION TO IRAQ TO CONVINCE BAGHDAD OF AN AMERICAN </p><p>DEMAND CLOSER TO THE (U.S.) JUSTIFICATION OF THE ATTACK ... WHAT </p><p>IS REQUIRED IS TO BENEFIT FROM THE COURAGEOUS FRENCH-GERMAN </p><p>POSITION AND SPEAK IN A UNIFIED ARAB VOICE.  WE ARE THE FIRST TO </p><p>BE AFFECTED BY TRAGEDY AND SHOULD NOT BE LIKE MICE WAITING TO </p><p>JUMP THE MOMENT BEFORE THE SHIP SINKS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON AN ANTICIPATED DATE FOR THE UPCOMING ARAB </p><p>SUMMIT, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... AN ARAB SUMMIT TO SAVE THE CURRENT SITUATION IS WHAT ALL </p><p>ARABS DESPERATELY NEED.  THEY (ARABS) CAN\'T ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT </p><p>THE REASONS FOR A CONFLICT COULD BE SAVING THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, </p><p>SAVING THE ARAB COUNTRIES AS A WHOLE, STOPPING THE OCCUPATION OF </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES, OR THE POSSIBILITY THAT ISRAEL HAS A HAND IN THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION IN IRAQ, OR THE INDICATIONS THAT OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES MAY BE A TARGET FOR THE NEXT ATTACK ...  IT IS THE DUTY </p><p>OF ARAB OFFICIALS TO STOP LISTENING TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WANTS AS INTER-ARAB CONFLICTS SERVE ONLY U.S. AND ZIONIST </p><p>SCHEMES, WHICH STAND TO GAIN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE AMERICAN </p><p>ATTACKS ON IRAQ AND OTHERS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON THE PRINCIPLES STRESSED BY THE UNITED ARAB </p><p>EMIRATES DURING RECENT UN SECURITY COUNCIL DELIBERATIONS, ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/21: </p><p> </p><p>"THE FIVE PRINCIPLES STRESSED BY THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES DURING </p><p>A RECENT UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN IRAQ, WERE NOT ONLY A BASIS FOR A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI CRISIS BUT ALSO A BASIS FOR SECURITY AND </p><p>HARMONY FOR THE ENTIRE REGION ...  THE UAE ALSO VOICED ITS </p><p>CONCERNS FOR THE DOUBLE STANDARD IN (U.S.) POLICY, WITH WHICH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS FED UP.  THIS IS POINTED OUT TO DRAW </p><p>THE WORLD\'S ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ELIMINATING WMD FROM </p><p>THE WHOLE REGION, INCLUDING ISRAEL, WHICH POSSESSES WMD AND IS </p><p>STILL OCCUPYING PALESTINIAN AND OTHER ARAB LANDS." </p><p> </p><p>8.  CRITICIZING ARAB CONFLICTS DESPITE RUMORS AND INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT THE ANTICIPATED WAR IS A PREPARATION FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST, </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/19: </p><p> </p><p>"...THE EMERGENCY SUMMIT OF ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS IN CAIRO </p><p>AIMING FOR A UNIFIED RESOLUTION (ON IRAQ) CONCLUDED WITH A </p><p>DISPUTE BETWEEN LEBANON AND KUWAIT ...  WITH THE ARAB CONFLICT </p><p>NOT BEING RESOLVED DESPITE RUMORS AND INDICATIONS THAT THIS WAR </p><p>IS A PREPARATION FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST, THE CRISIS GOES BEYOND </p><p>IRAQ.  IT IS A TRAGEDY TO ACCEPT ANYTHING IMPOSED ON THE REGION </p><p>PASSIVELY BEFORE IT HAPPENS INSTEAD OF BEING ACTIVE IN ALL </p><p>DECISIONS AFFECT THE REGION.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, A SUMMIT IS </p><p>NOT NEEDED." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
