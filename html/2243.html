<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 006121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/PD/PA (HILTON), DRL/IRF (FARR </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NUMBER 209/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SOCI, TBIO, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN CONDEMNS CLONING EXPERIMENT </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: VATICAN 1745 </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE VATICAN HAS REITERATED ITS UNEQUIVOCAL CONDEMNATION </p><p>OF HUMAN CLONING FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY ADVANCED CELL </p><p>TECHNOLOGY THAT IT HAD CARRIED OUT THE PROCEDURE. THE VATICAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06121  281208Z </p><p>DECLARED THE EVENT AS A "GRAVE" DEVELOPMENT. THE VATICAN </p><p>INSISTS THE CELLS ARE HUMAN LIFE AND THAT SCIENTISTS SHOULD </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE DEALING WITH HUMAN EMBRYOS INSTEAD OF </p><p>TALKING ABOUT CLUSTERS OF CELLS. </p><p> </p><p>2.   CLAIMS OF THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF CLONED HUMAN </p><p>EMBRYOS WERE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR THE VATICAN, WHICH </p><p>CRITICIZED THE HIERARCHY OF THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE APPARENTLY </p><p>INTRODUCED BY THE THERAPIES. FOR THE VATICAN EVERY HUMAN LIFE, </p><p>FROM CELL ONE TO NATURAL DEATH, HAS EQUAL VALUE. IF ONE </p><p>PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT STAGE IS SINGLED OUT FOR USE BY ANOTHER </p><p>MORE MATURE STAGE, IT WARNED OF A NEW FORM OF DISCRIMINATION </p><p>BASED ON "STAGE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT" - AN EMBRYO BEING WORTH </p><p>LESS THAN A FETUS, AN INFANT HAVING LESS VALUE THAN AN ADULT </p><p>AND SO ON. THE VATICAN STATEMENT PROMOTED ALTERNATIVE STEM </p><p>CELL RESEARCH AND THERAPY USING STEM CELLS FROM ADULTS AND </p><p>SPONTANEOUSLY ABORTED FETUSES WHICH IT DECLARED SCIENTIFICALLY </p><p>VALID AND MORALLY LICIT. </p><p> </p><p>3.   NOTE: POLOFF WAS TOLD BY A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR LIFE (BIOETHICAL ISSUES) THAT HE FELT </p><p>"BETRAYED" BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH HE EXPECTED TO PREVENT </p><p>CLONING TAKING PLACE. THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS 11/26 DECLARING </p><p>CLONING "WRONG" WERE REPORTED BY VATICAN-BASED MEDIA. WE </p><p>EXPECT THE VATICAN WILL APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS. </p><p>END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>4.   COMMENT: WE DO NOT EXPECT THE VATICAN TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>POSITION ON HUMAN CLONING. HOWEVER, SHOULD THE PROCEDURE </p><p>EVENTUALLY LEAD TO MATURE HUMAN "CLONES" TAKING THEIR PLACE IN </p><p>SOCIETY THEN THE VATICAN WOULD URGE FULL RESPECT AND RIGHTS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06121  281208Z </p><p>BE ACCORDED TO SUCH HUMAN BEINGS (REFTEL). THE VATICAN TAKES A </p><p>SIMILAR APPROACH TO PEOPLE CONCEIVED BY "IN VITRO" AND OTHER </p><p>WHAT IT DEFINES AS MORALLY ILLICIT PROCEDURES. END COMMENT. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06121 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
