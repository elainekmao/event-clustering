<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE STRONGMAN ILL WITH CANCER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A reliable source with very close personal ties to top </p><p>military medical officers corroborated recent DAO Rangoon </p><p>reports that Vice Senior General Maung Aye has been </p><p>hospitalized.  Our source indicated, though, that Maung Aye </p><p>had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer that is not </p><p>treatable in Burma.  The source hypothesized that the SPDC </p><p>Vice Chairman would soon be sent to Singapore for treatment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: The apparent serious illness of Maung Aye </p><p>leads us to begin speculation on an SPDC without its current </p><p>second-in-command.  The obvious choice of successor based on </p><p>rank and seniority is General Khin Nyunt (now Secretary One). </p><p> However, according to one former army officer, it would be </p><p>unprecedented for a military intelligence officer (who is </p><p>also not a graduate of the Defense Service Academy) to take </p><p>over as Deputy Commander-in-Chief.  The other major players </p><p>in the SPDC now are reportedly too junior to be considered </p><p>for the Deputy position.  Thus, the structure of a Burmese </p><p>regime sans Maung Aye could look much different than it </p><p>currently does.  We doubt, though, whether policy would </p><p>change significantly.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
