ON MAY 29, THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT UPHELD A HIGH </p><p>COURT CONVICTION OF ZIMBABWE\'S FORMER NON-EXECUTIVE </p><p>PRESIDENT CANAAN BANANA (1980-1987), SENTENCING HIM TO </p><p>ONE-YEAR IMPRISONMENT FOR 11 COUNTS OF SEXUAL OFFENSES. </p><p>BANANA WAS CONVICTED IN THE HIGH COURT IN JANUARY 1999 FOR </p><p>11 COUNTS OF SODOMY, ARISING OUT OF CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST </p><p>HIM IN 1997 BY HIS FORMER AIDE-DE- CAMP, JEFTA DUBE.  THE </p><p>SODOMY CHARGES AGAINST BANANA FIRST SURFACE IN DURING </p><p>DURING DUBE\'S TRAIL FOR MURDERING A POLICEMAN IN 1997 WHO </p><p>HAD CALLED HIM BANANA\'S "WIFE."  DUBE PLEADED MENTAL </p><p>INCAPACITY DUE TO THE YEARS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY BANANA AND </p><p>WAS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IMPRISONMENT.  FOLLOWING BANANA\'S </p><p>HIGH COURT CONVICTION, DUBE APPLIED FOR A PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PARDON. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONSTITUTION DID NOT MAKE SODOMY A CRIME, THE PRACTICE WAS </p><p>ILLEGAL UNDER THE COMMON LAW.  THE COURT, HOWEVER, REDUCED </p><p>THE HIGH COURT SENTENCES IMPOSED ON EACH OF THE 11 COUNTS, </p><p>SUSPENDING THE JAIL SENTENCES ON SEVERAL CHARGES OF SODOMY </p><p>AND INDECENT ASSAULT, ON THE CONDITION THAT BANANA NOT </p><p>COMMIT THE SAME CRIME IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  BANANA WAS, </p><p>HOWEVER, SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS FOR THE NUMEROUS </p><p>"UNNATURAL OFFENSES" AGAINST DUBE, WITH TWO YEARS SUSPENDED </p><p>FOR THREE YEARS ON THE CONDITION THAT HE PAID APPROXIMATELY </p><p>USD 89 RESTITUTION TO DUBE BY AUGUST 31.  THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY ONLY ORDERED THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT SERVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02906  011337Z </p><p>ONE-YEAR INCARCERATED. </p><p> </p><p>3: BANANA\'S CONVICTION IS THE FIRST TIME A SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HAS BEEN PROSECUTED FOR A CRIME </p><p>INVOLVING HOMOSEXUALITY.  BANANA CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THAT </p><p>HIS CONVICTION WAS "POLITICALLY MOTIVATED" AND HE HAS </p><p>DECLINED TO REVEAL WHETHER HE WOULD APPLY FOR A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PARDON.  DURING BANANA\'S APPEAL PERIOD, </p><p>HOWEVER, WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF ANY HARASSMENT </p><p>DIRECTED AT THE FORMER PRESIDENT.  SINCE JANUARY 1997 </p><p>BANANA HAS BEEN FREE TO TRAVEL ABROAD FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT </p><p>AND HAS NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANY EXTREME BAIL RESTRICTIONS </p><p>OR OTHER HARDSHIPS.  NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY ATTACKED HOMOSEXUALS AS "PIGS AND DOGS" AND </p><p>HAS DESCRIBED SUCH SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS AGAINST AFRICAN </p><p>CULTURE.  THIS VEHEMENT ANTI-GAY STANCE WILL MAKE IT </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO NOW PARDON HIS CLOSE ALLY.  ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>SOCIETY REMAINS GENERALLY HOSTILE TOWARDS GAY PEOPLE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NOT VIOLENT, AS EVIDENCED IN THE PUBLIC\'S </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO ADDRESS HOMOSEXUAL CONCERNS DURING THE </p><p>NATIONAL DEBATES DURING LAST YEAR\'S CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM OUTREACH MEETINGS.  FOLLOWING THE HIGH COURT </p><p>CONVICTION, MANY PEOPLE INDICATED THAT BANANA\'S SENTENCE </p><p>WAS TOO LENIENT, BUT EXPRESSED SATISFACTION THAT AT LEAST </p><p>HE DID NOT TOTALLY ESCAPE PUNISHMENT FOR HIS CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
