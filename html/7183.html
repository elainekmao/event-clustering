<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The war to disarm Iraq remains a popular topic for op- </p><p>      eds in the mainstream media.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "United States pursuing hidden </p><p>      commercial agenda in Iraq" the April 7 edition of </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" carried </p><p>      the following op-ed by Munyaradzi Mugowo on page 8: </p><p> </p><p>      "The unilateral decision by the U.S. to attack Iraq </p><p>      without the U.N. mandate has sparked worldwide anti- </p><p>      war protests and a continuing international debate </p><p>      on the possible implications of the bully, imperious </p><p>      nature of the U.S. .  Kofi Annan seems to be </p><p>      concerned more with U.N. humanitarian interventions </p><p>      in Iraq [and] the rights of the prisoners of war as </p><p>      provided for by the Geneva Convention, than with </p><p>      ending U.S. aggression in the interest of world </p><p>      peace and security.  Allegations of terrorism and </p><p>      human rights violations are always made in geo- </p><p>      settings where the U.S. and Britain have vested </p><p>      commercial interests, especially in circumstances </p><p>      where politico-military aggression appears to be the </p><p>      only conceivable compensation for foreign policy </p><p>      failure.  As a result, a common thread ties the U.S. </p><p>      witch-hunting escapades tenaciously with regimes </p><p>      opposed to both unipolar international relations and </p><p>      U.S. militeralism. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "DRC and Iraq wars linked: U.S., UK </p><p>      seek to re-colonize African and Gulf states, the </p><p>      April 6 edition of the government-controlled weekly </p><p>      "The Sunday Mail" carried the following opinion </p><p>      piece by Tafataona Mahoso.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The U.S. and the UK supported the aggression </p><p>      against the DRC and the U.S. and the UK are re- </p><p>      colonizing Iraq.  The re-colonizing of Iraq because </p><p>      it is rich in petroleum means that we have not yet </p><p>      seen the end of the imperialist struggle to re- </p><p>      colonize the DRC for its strategic minerals.  The </p><p>      peace accord is only a short break; and the African </p><p>      countries supporting the U.S.-UK aggression against </p><p>      Iraq may be used both to divide the African Union </p><p>      and to endorse U.S.-UK efforts to re-colonize </p><p>      Africa. . .  The first step Pan-Africanists would </p><p>      expect from African leaders is a clear condemnation </p><p>      of the barbarism we are witnessing in Iraq.  The </p><p>      second step would be a wake-up call to the people of </p><p>      Africa, showing that African leaders understand that </p><p>      the Anglo-American unipolar world is not about </p><p>      democracy, human rights, transparency, good </p><p>      governance and rule of law.  Rather it is a world of </p><p>      greed, lies and genocide." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
