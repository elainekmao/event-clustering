<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, CA, UNESCO </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA ON UNESCO BOARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 15524 B. OTTAWA 1119 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Post delivered points contained ref A to Jean-Luc </p><p>Chouinard, Special Advisor for UNESCO in DFAIT\'s UN and </p><p>Commonwealth Affairs Division, and Dr. Michel Tessier, </p><p>Elections Co-ordinator in that division, on June 10, 2003. </p><p>We also asked again if Canada would consider deferring its </p><p>UNESCO Executive Board candidacy in order to achieve a clean </p><p>slate of Group I candidates. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Chouinard indicated that Canada would like a seat on </p><p>the board at the October conference and is actively seeking </p><p>support for its candidacy from other member states.  There </p><p>are a number of UNESCO issues Canada wants to defend and </p><p>promote, Chouinard said, and it believes the best way to do </p><p>that is by regaining its seat on the Board. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chouinard didn\'t close the door completely, however. </p><p>He said Canada believes in the principle of rotating Board </p><p>seats, and feels Group 1 membership should be better balanced </p><p>between EU and non-EU states. He believes there is merit to a </p><p>rotation scheme over the long-term, as long as others are </p><p>committed to it, and that Canada will support our efforts to </p><p>establish such a scheme. (Comment: Chouinard was clear that </p><p>Canada wants to rejoin the UNESCO board this year while </p><p>remaining open to the idea of a slate and a long-term </p><p>rotation scheme.  It is unlikely Canada will agree to a slate </p><p>for this year\'s election unless it is part of that slate. End </p><p>comment.) </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
