IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: ON DECEMBER 5, TERENCE HUSSEIN, AN </p><p>ATTORNEY AFFILIATED WITH INYIKA TRUST, MET WITH ECONOFF </p><p>AT THE EMBASSY.  INYIKA TRUST IS A NEWLY REGISTERED NGO </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE WHOSE STATED PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE LEGAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND REPRESENTATION TO COMMUNAL FARMERS AND </p><p>LANDLESS BLACK ZIMBABWEANS.  THE TRUST CAME TO THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S ATTENTION WHEN IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE </p><p>NEWSPAPERS AS THE ORGANIZATION PROVIDING LEGAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO TWO BLACK ZIMBABWEANS WHO INDIVIDUALLY </p><p>FILED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATED TO THE LAND REFORM </p><p>ISSUE.  THE SUITS ARE A DIRECT RESPONSE TO COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) LAWSUITS AND LEGAL MANEUVERS. </p><p>HUSSEIN STATED THAT INYIKA TRUST IS APOLITICAL AND NON- </p><p>PARTISAN, AND THAT IT IS CRITICAL OF BOTH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) AND THE CFU FOR FAILING TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE IN ZIMBABWE.  HUSSEIN EXPLAINED THAT HIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION WILL ENGAGE IN A MAJOR LEGAL EFFORT TO </p><p>DECLARE THE LAND TITLE SYSTEM IN ZIMBABWE INVALID, SINCE </p><p>IT ORIGINATED IN THE ILLEGAL SEIZURE OF LAND BY THE </p><p>EARLY BRITISH SETTLERS.  IT WILL ALSO INITIATE LEGAL </p><p>ACTION TO FORCE THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) TO PAY </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR WHAT WAS STOLEN FROM THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PEOPLE DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD.  ECONOFF ENCOURAGED </p><p>HUSSEIN AND INYIKA TRUST TO SERVE A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07159  01 OF 03  201008Z </p><p>THE LAND REFORM DEBATE.  POST SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED FROM </p><p>A LOCAL ATTORNEY THAT HUSSEIN\'S LAW FIRM IS PROVIDING </p><p>LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GOZ\'S MINISTER FOR INFORMATION </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO, AS WELL AS TO ZANU-PF.  ON DECEMBER 12 </p><p>INYIKA TRUST FAXED A LETTER TO THE EMBASSY ADDRESSED TO </p><p>SECRETARY ALBRIGHT, CRITICIZING THE SECRETARY FOR THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COMMENTS SHE MADE REGARDING THE LAND REFORM AND RULE OF </p><p>LAW ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE DURING HER VISIT TO BOTSWANA. </p><p>THE DECEMBER 13 ISSUE OF THE GOZ-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER </p><p>"THE HERALD" RAN A STORY HEADLINED "INYIKA TRUST </p><p>CONDEMN\'S ALBRIGHT\'S COMMENTS CONCERNING LAND ISSUE." </p><p>INYIKA TRUST ON DECEMBER 19 RAN A FULL-PAGE AD IN THE </p><p>GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER OFFERING THEIR </p><p>SERVICES TO ALL RESETTLED FARMERS WHO RECEIVE EVICTION </p><p>NOTICES FROM ZIMBABWE\'S COURTS.  WE SUSPECT INYIKA IS A </p><p>ZANU-PF CUT-OUT ORGANIZATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS INYIKA TRUST? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) INYIKA TRUST, FORMALLY LAUNCHED ON NOVEMBER 24, </p><p>CLAIMS TO BE AN APOLITICAL, NON-PARTISAN NGO FORMED TO </p><p>REPRESENT THE VIEWS AND INTERESTS OF BLACK ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>LIVING ON COMMUNAL LANDS AND LANDLESS PEOPLE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY.  PER TRUST MATERIALS, "INYIKA" MEANS </p><p>"LAND" IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE NAMBYA TRIBE, A SMALL </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN TRIBE FROM THE DETE AREA OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HUSSEIN, INYIKA TRUST IS COMPOSED OF TWO </p><p>SEPARATE LEGAL BODIES: INYIKA, WHICH HAS A MEMBERSHIP </p><p>DRAWN FROM PEOPLE FROM COMMUNAL AREAS AND LANDLESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07159  01 OF 03  201008Z </p><p>PEOPLE RECENTLY RESETTLED ON FARMS, AND IS APOLITICAL </p><p>PER ITS CONSTITUTION; AND INYIKA TRUST, WHICH IS </p><p>DEDICATED TO OBTAINING AND DISBURSING FUNDS TO </p><p>APPROPRIATE CAUSES, WITH MOST OF ITS FUNDING GOING TO </p><p>SUPPORT INYIKA.  INYIKA TRUST HAS A BOARD OF TRUSTEES, </p><p>OF WHICH HUSSEIN IS A MEMBER.  INYIKA TRUST\'S PRINCIPLE </p><p>OBJECTIVES ARE: TO REPRESENT COMMUNAL FARMERS IN THEIR </p><p>QUEST FOR LAND; TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF LANDLESS </p><p>PEOPLE ON RESETTLED FARMS; TO MOUNT LEGAL CHALLENGES TO </p><p>THE LAND TENURE SYSTEM RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL LAND; TO </p><p>OBTAIN COMPENSATION FROM THE BRITISH MONARCH FOR THE </p><p>UNLAWFUL ACTIONS OF HER GOVERNMENT AND SUBJECTS THAT LED </p><p>TO BLACK ZIMBABWEANS LOSING THEIR LANDS; AND TO </p><p>PUBLICIZE THE PLIGHT OF THE LANDLESS AND DISPOSSESSED </p><p>PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE.  INYIKA TRUST HAS AS ITS SLOGAN "THE </p><p>TIME HAS COME TO PAY THE RENT."  HUSSEIN STATED THAT THE </p><p>BOARD OF TRUSTEES WAS NOT COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED, BUT </p><p>THAT IT WAS COMPOSED OF BLACK ZIMBABWEAN LAWYERS DOING </p><p>PROBONO WORK FOR INYIKA TRUST. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE TWO CLASS ACTION SUITS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8569 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07159  02 OF 03  201008Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    USIE-00 </p><p>      BBG-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------ADBA08  201017Z /38 </p><p>R 201008Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7878 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 007159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p> </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/20/10 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PREL, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INYIKA TRUST, A NEW PLAYER ON THE LAND ISSUE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  07159  02 OF 03  201008Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) INYIKA TRUST IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING </p><p>TWO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED BY </p><p>SEPARATE BLACK ZIMBABWEANS.  THE FIRST SUIT WAS FILED BY </p><p>SAMSON MHURIRO, A BLACK ZIMBABWEAN RESETTLED ON A FARM </p><p>IN 1998.  MHURIRO\'S LAWSUIT SEEKS TO HAVE THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT CONSENT ORDER REQUIRING THE IMMEDIATE EVICTION OF </p><p>ALL PEOPLE OCCUPYING FARMS NULLIFIED BECAUSE IT VIOLATES </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THESE PEOPLE (REF B AND C). </p><p>THE SECOND SUIT WAS FILED BY EDNA MARIMIRA, A BLACK </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN WHO LIVES IN A COMMUNAL FARM VILLAGE. </p><p>MARIMIRA\'S LAWSUIT SEEKS TO HAVE THE LEGAL TITLES TO </p><p>AGRICULTURAL LAND IN ZIMBABWE DECLARED INVALID SINCE THE </p><p>LAND WAS ORIGINALLY STOLEN FROM THE INHABITANTS BY THE </p><p>BRITISH COLONISTS.  HER SUIT SEEKS TO HAVE THE LAND </p><p>OWNERSHIP REVERT BACK TO COMMON OWNERSHIP OF THE BLACK </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>A NON-PARTISAN NGO VOICE FOR THE LANDLESS? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN LINE WITH HUSSEIN\'S STATEMENT THAT INYIKA </p><p>TRUST IS APOLITICAL AND NON-PARTISAN, HE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>GOZ AS BEING AS MUCH TO BLAME AS THE CFU AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS FOR THE FAILURE OF LAND REFORM THROUGH THE </p><p>PRESENT.  WHILE HE CRITICIZED THE COURTS, AND ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT, HE ALSO HAD HARSH WORDS FOR THE GOZ </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE, AND THE GOZ MINISTRIES THAT </p><p>HAVE TRADITIONALLY DEALT WITH LAND REFORM AND THE </p><p>COMMUNAL AREAS.  HE STATED THAT THE GOZ HAS FAILED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07159  02 OF 03  201008Z </p><p>SUPPORT THE COMMUNAL FARMERS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>OTHER ASSISTANCE, OR TO ACT ON BEHALF OF LANDLESS BLACK </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS IN RESETTLING THEM.  HE STATED THAT INYIKA </p><p>IS NOT RACIALLY EXCLUSIVE IN ITS MEMBERSHIP OR THE </p><p>CAUSES IT WILL SUPPORT, BUT THAT THE HISTORICAL REALITY </p><p>IS THAT BLACKS ARE THE RACIAL GROUP THAT WAS </p><p>DISPOSSESSED OF LAND AND THAT NEEDS ASSISTANCE MOST. </p><p>HUSSEIN DID NOT CRITICIZE OR DEFEND PRESIDENT MUGABE OR </p><p>OTHER GOZ OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A NEW ZANU-PF FRONT ORGANIZATION? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FOLLOWING THE DECEMBER 5 MEETING, ECONOFF </p><p>CONTACTED MIKE AURET JR. (PROTECT), A ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ATTORNEY WHO IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LEGAL PROFESSION </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE AND HAS IN THE PAST PROVIDED ACCURATE </p><p>INFORMATION TO THE EMBASSY.  (NOTE: MIKE AURET SR., THE </p><p>FATHER OF MIKE AURET JR., IS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MDC.)  AURET JR. INFORMED ECONOFF THAT </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S LAW FIRM, HUSSEIN, RANCHHOD AND CO., IS A LAW </p><p>FIRM THAT THE GOZ MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO USED TO ASSIST IN THE DRAFTING OF THE </p><p>GOZ\'S NEW AND REPRESSIVE BROADCASTING REGULATIONS.  THIS </p><p>LAW FIRM IS ALSO ASSISTING ZANU-PF IN ITS DEFENSE OF THE </p><p>LAWSUITS THE MDC HAS FILED CHALLENGING THE JUNE ELECTION </p><p>RESULTS IN 38 PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIES.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS INFORMATION, WHICH POST FINDS CREDIBLE, CALLS INTO </p><p>QUESTION THE ALLEGED APOLITICAL AND NON-PARTISAN </p><p>CHARACTER OF INYIKA TRUST.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07159  02 OF 03  201008Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>INYIKA TRUST PROTESTS ALBRIGHT\'S COMMENTS ON ZIMBABWE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) ON DECEMBER 12, FOLLOWING SECRETARY ALBRIGHT\'S </p><p>COMMENTS REGARDING THE LAND REFORM AND RULE OF LAW </p><p>ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE DURING HER VISIT TO BOTSWANA, THE </p><p>EMBASSY RECEIVED A FAXED LETTER FROM INYIKA TRUST.  THIS </p><p>LETTER IS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE SECRETARY, AND </p><p>CRITICIZES HER FOR HER COMMENTS IN BOTSWANA, AND DETAILS </p><p>INYIKA TRUST\'S POSITION ON THE LAND REFORM ISSUE (REF </p><p>A).

THE AD ALSO LISTS LAW OFFICES </p><p>IN TEN CITIES AND TOWNS IN ZIMBABWE THAT WORK WITH </p><p>INYIKA TRUST.

(COMMENT: THIS AD AND </p><p>THE OFFER OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY RESETTLED FARMERS </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT INYIKA TRUST HAS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL </p><p>BACKING FROM UNDETERMINED SOURCES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: HUSSEIN CAME ACROSS AS A REASONABLE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL DURING HIS CONVERSATION WITH ECONOFF AND USED </p><p>NONE OF THE HISTRIONICS COMMON AMONG GOZ AND ZANU-PF </p><p>OFFICIALS.  HIS BALANCED CRITICISM OF BOTH THE GOZ AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, AND HIS COMMENT THAT LAND WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO BE TAKEN FROM BLACK COMMERCIAL FARMERS AS WELL AS </p><p>WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, SUGGESTS THAT INYIKA TRUST HAS </p><p>WORKED HARD ON A POLISHED PRESENTATION THAT WILL PROVE </p><p>IT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ZANU-PF.  HOWEVER, THE THRUST </p><p>OF THE LAWSUITS THAT INYIKA TRUST IS SUPPORTING, </p><p>INCLUDING THE CHALLENGE TO THE VALIDITY OF LAND TITLES </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, CALLS INTO QUESTION THE CLAIMED APOLITICAL, </p><p>NON-PARTISAN CHARACTER OF INYIKA TRUST.  IT ALSO LEADS </p><p>POST TO BELIEVE THAT INYIKA TRUST WILL NOT BE A MODERATE </p><p>AND CONSTRUCTIVE ACTOR ON THE LAND REFORM ISSUE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND, INDEED, APPEARS TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN A </p><p>ZANU-PF CUT OUT ORGANIZATION CREATED TO COUNTER THE CFU </p><p>RECOURSE TO THE COURTS TO REDRESS ITS LAND-RELATED </p><p>GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE RULING PARTY AND THE GOZ. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07159  03 OF 03  201008Z </p><p>ECONOFF ENCOURAGED HUSSEIN TO BROADEN THE ROLE THAT </p><p>INYIKA TRUST CAN PLAY IN REPRESENTING THE COMMUNAL </p><p>FARMERS AND LANDLESS PEOPLE IN ZIMBABWE TO ONE OF </p><p>BUILDING BRIDGES AND SUPPORTING A TRANSPARENT, </p><p>EQUITABLE, AND LEGAL LAND REFORM PROGRAM.
