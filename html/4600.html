<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 001544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND INL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>NSC FOR BEERS </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>MANILA ALSO FOR USED/ADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE INFORMATION ON BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS </p><p>PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 1355 </p><p>     B. RANGOON 1415 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 1473 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The GOB has recently released a bevy of information on </p><p>its counternarcotics efforts, most of which we have reported </p><p>in our previous cables (reftels).  However, in this cable we </p><p>are providing some new information as follows: </p><p> </p><p>UN Protocol </p><p> </p><p>2.  The GOB has decided to accede to the 1972 Protocol to the </p><p>UN\'s 1961 Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs.  Once signed, </p><p>this will mean that Burma has become party to all of the UN\'s </p><p>major narcotics conventions, including the 1961 Single </p><p>Convention, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic </p><p>Substances, and the 1988 UN Drug Convention. </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements </p><p> </p><p>3.  Burma has signed bilateral narcotics control agreements </p><p>with all of its near and some of its not so near neighbors. </p><p>These include agreements with China, Thailand, India, </p><p>Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos, the Phillipines, and Russia.  It </p><p>is also a partner in UNDCP\'s six nation ACCORD plan of action </p><p>in Southeast Asia and a member, with China, Thailand, and </p><p>Laos, in the Mekong Sub-regional Cooperative Program against </p><p>drugs. </p><p> </p><p>New Destiny Project </p><p> </p><p>4.  During the spring of 2002, the GOB collected </p><p>approximately 290 metric tons of poppy seed in exchange for </p><p>winter food crop seeds and other support.  According to the </p><p>government, this is enough to seed approximately 40,000 </p><p>hectares of opium poppy, and is the basis of its prediction </p><p>that it will cut the area under opium cultivation in Burma </p><p>from approximately 80,000 hectares to 40,000 hectares during </p><p>the current crop year. </p><p> </p><p>Seizures and Arrests </p><p> </p><p>5.  The latest figures for arrests and seizures indicate that </p><p>the GOB has arrested 3,730 suspects in 2,529 drug-related </p><p>cases from January 1, 2002 through November 15.  During that </p><p>same time period, it seized 1,737 kilograms of opium, 300 </p><p>kilograms of heroin, 262 kilograms of marijuana, 9,191,000 </p><p>stimulant tablets, and 1,711 kilograms of ephedrine.  Most of </p><p>these numbers are in line with previous years, though the </p><p>seizures of stimulant tablets are well below last year\'s </p><p>total of more than 32 million. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
