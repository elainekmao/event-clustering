Summary:  Krishna Bahadur Mahara, one of the top leaders </p><p>of Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency, granted an interview to CNN on </p><p>November 14.  Mahara, speaking in an open setting with no </p><p>apparent fear of capture, unabashedly used the opportunity to </p><p>spread misinformation and propaganda on the international </p><p>stage. The interview, almost certainly to have taken place in </p><p>India, reinforces Government of Nepal (GON) suspicions that </p><p>India is unwilling--rather than unable--to cooperate in </p><p>handing over the principal leaders of the insurgency. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAHARA SAYS MAOISTS NOT TERRORISTS; </p><p>CLAIMS NO KILLING OF INNOCENTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who carries a </p><p>$65,000 price on his head and is subject to an INTERPOL </p><p>warrant, was the chief negotiator in last year\'s failed peace </p><p>talks between the Maoists and the GON.  Mahara met with CNN </p><p>New Delhi\'s Satinder Bindra in an undisclosed location on </p><p>November 14.  Mahara is a senior politburo member of the </p><p>outlawed Maoist party, and considered to be one of the top </p><p>leaders of the movement. </p><p> </p><p>3. Calling GON accusations of terrorism "baseless </p><p>allegations," Mahara denied the use of child soldiers and the </p><p>killing of civilians.  "We condemn all types of terrorism," </p><p>he claimed. "We are a political force... we are not </p><p>terrorists and that is clear."  Mahara also stated that the </p><p>Maoists have no children in their fighting force.  "We do not </p><p>admit anyone below 18 in our army," he said. "We have the </p><p>support of the children as well as the elderly.  But they are </p><p>not a part of our army."  Blaming the government for civilian </p><p>deaths that have been attributed to the insurgency, Mahara </p><p>said that allegations of Maoists killing innocents are false. </p><p>"We have only killed the criminal elements of our society and </p><p>that too after issuing them several warnings," he added. </p><p> </p><p>4. The blatant mendacity of Mahara\'s statements was apparent </p><p>from the clip which immediately preceded interview\'s </p><p>broadcast, and is further illustrated by recent news reports. </p><p>His assertions that the Maoists execute criminal elements </p><p>rather than indiscriminately killing civilians directly </p><p>followed a clip of Thursday\'s incident in which 2 civilians </p><p>were killed and 25 injured when their passenger bus was </p><p>blasted by a Maoist landmine. The day before the interview, a </p><p>mentally disabled 12-year-old and a 14-year-old on his way to </p><p>school were killed by two separate Maoist bombs (ref A).  Not </p><p>a day goes by without further reports of Maoist brutality--of </p><p>farmers hacked to death, postal workers beheaded and </p><p>vegetable sellers blown up by Maoist bombs. Mahara\'s claim </p><p>that the Maoists do not employ child soldiers bears equally </p><p>little resemblance to reality. In March, Ambassador </p><p>Malinowski met with child recruits in the southwestern city </p><p>of Nepalgunj who were forced to join the "people\'s army," to </p><p>take weapons training and to fight due to fear rather than </p><p>ideology (ref B).  Other Embassy officers also have </p><p>personally interviewed Maoist child recruits. </p><p> </p><p>5. Mahara\'s interview was broadcast against the backdrop of </p><p>coordinated Maoist attacks in Jumla and Gorkha districts, in </p><p>which 60 police and soldiers were killed (ref C).  "We want </p><p>peace," Mahara stated in his interview. "It is the ruling </p><p>class that is committing injustice on the people; all we are </p><p>doing is resisting." Yet reports from Jumla indicate that </p><p>villagers were used as human shields by the Maoists, and may </p><p>have been killed in the crossfire; that Maoists shot and </p><p>killed a prison guard after breaking into the district jail </p><p>and freeing the inmates; and that they looted 3.8 million </p><p>rupees (50,000 USD) in cash and valuables from the local </p><p>bank.  The interview came five days after a Maoist hit squad </p><p>killed Embassy contract security supervisor Deepak Pokhrel </p><p>(ref D); and two days before the Maoists claimed credit for </p><p>this killing and also for a previous killing of an Embassy </p><p>direct hire guard (ref E). </p><p> </p><p>6. Full text of Mahara\'s interview with CNN is available </p><p>online at </p><p>asia.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asaipcf/south/11/14/n epal.leader.iv. </p><p> </p><p>INDIA SUSPECTED AS LOCATION OF INTERVIEW </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Though CNN coverage gave no indication of Mahara\'s </p><p>whereabouts, the interview was filmed in a calm garden </p><p>setting, in fairly opulent surroundings: Mahara was seated on </p><p>the floor in a well-appointed room with expensive furnishings </p><p>and electronic equipment.  Most Nepalis believe that the </p><p>Maoist leader is hiding in India, and local watchers, closely </p><p>examining the scene for evidence of the leader\'s location, </p><p>have cited evidence as tenuous as a view of a particular type </p><p>of tree that "only grows in southern India," as proof that </p><p>Mahara is located south of the border.  There is  speculation </p><p>that the interview was conducted in Bangalore. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Senior Nepali officials have been charging for years that </p><p>their efforts at bringing the Maoists under control have been </p><p>compromised by the fact that the principal leaders of the </p><p>insurgency can find safety and support in India.  While the </p><p>GON admits that India has been helpful in handing over a few </p><p>Maoists who have fled across the border, the returnees have </p><p>all been low-level members of the insurgency and not the "big </p><p>fish."  There is a persistent belief that the GOI wil not go </p><p>after the chief offenders because of a desire to maintain </p><p>leverage over the Nepalis.  This brazen public appearance by </p><p>a leader as highy placed as Mahara would seem to support this </p><p>view. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
