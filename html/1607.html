<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ELAB, CB, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT HIGHLANDERS IN CAMBODIA AND VIETNAMESE WORKERS IN AMERICAN SAMOA </p><p> </p><p>REF: HANOI 00598 </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00702  01 OF 02  261056Z </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: AMERICAS DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR ASKED AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>MEET AFTERNOON OF MARCH 26 TO RAISE VIETNAMESE CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT A GROUP OF HIGHLANDERS WHO HAVE ILLEGALLY CROSSED THE </p><p>BORDER INTO CAMBODIA AND TO REITERATE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OBJECTIVES TO REMOVE ALL VIETNAMESE WORKERS FROM AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA.  AMBASSADOR PROMISED TO RELAY VIETNAMESE CONCERNS TO </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO RAISED U.S. REQUESTS FOR OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO VISIT CENTRAL HIGHLAND AREAS WHICH HAD BEEN THE SITE OF </p><p>JANUARY/FEBRUARY DISTURBANCES.  ON THE LATTER POINT, </p><p>AMERICAS DIRECTOR SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS "ONLY A MATTER OF </p><p>TIME" BEFORE THIS WOULD OCCUR. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. AMERICAS DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR NGUYEN MANH HUNG ASKED </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO COME TO MFA AFTERNOON OF MARCH 26 AND RAISED </p><p>TWO ISSUES WHICH HE SAID HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED </p><p>RECENTLY BECAUSE OF USG ACTIONS.  HUNG BEGAN BY RAISING THE </p><p>CASE OF A GROUP OF CENTRAL HIGHLANDS RESIDENTS WHO HAD </p><p>ILLEGALLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO CAMBODIA.  HE SAID THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS HAD BEEN DETAINED BY CAMBODIAN AUTHORITIES AND </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE NOW DISCUSSING THEIR RETURN TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  ACCORDING TO HUNG, THE VIETNAMESE EFFORTS WERE </p><p>BEING COMPLICATED BY THE INTERVENTION OF "MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY DEFENSE ATTACHE OFFICE IN PHNOM PENH" WHICH WAS </p><p>URGING THE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT NOT TO RETURN THESE </p><p>VIETNAMESE CITIZENS TO VIETNAM.  HUNG STRESSED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>AND CAMBODIA HAVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT COVERING ILLEGAL </p><p>BORDER CROSSERS AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHOULD GOVERN HOW </p><p>THIS CASE WAS HANDLED.  HE ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO RELAY </p><p>HANOI\'S REQUEST THAT U.S. EMBASSY PHNOM PENH OFFICIALS STOP </p><p>THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS BILATERAL MATTER. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00702  01 OF 02  261056Z </p><p> </p><p>3. SEEKING CLARIFICATION OF WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE BORDER CROSSERS WERE IN SOME WAY </p><p>FLEEING FROM THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES.  HUNG CONCURRED </p><p>THAT THE INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION HAD COME FROM THE BORDER </p><p>PROVINCES WHERE THE DISTURBANCES HAD OCCURRED AND IMPLIED </p><p>THE INDIVIDUALS WERE IN FACT BEING SOUGHT FOR POSSIBLE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE DISTURBANCES.  AMBASSADOR SAID WE WERE </p><p>UNAWARE OF ANY REPORTS OF ACTIVITIES BY EMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>PERSONNEL AND AGREED TO PASS THIS MESSAGE BACK TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE TO REFLECT VIETNAM\'S CONCERN. </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND DCM IMPLIED THAT THE CROSSING OF THE BORDER </p><p>MIGHT, HOWEVER, INVOLVE MORE CONCERNS THAN JUST THE </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>4. HUNG NEXT TURNED TO GVN CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATUS OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE WORKERS IN AMERICAN SAMOA.  HE SAID HE\'D JUST </p><p>LEARNED THAT ABOUT 100 OF THESE WORKERS HAD NOW REPORTEDLY </p><p>GONE TO HAWAII -- PURPORTEDLY CONNECTED TO ONGOING </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS OF THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>THIS CASE.  HUNG SAID THIS TRULY COMPLICATED VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO BRING ALL OF THESE WORKERS </p><p>BACK HOME.  HE SAID THE GVN HAD COMMITTED TO BRING ALL THESE </p><p>PEOPLE HOME AND HAD AGREED TO PAY THE COSTS WHEN THEY </p><p>DISCOVERED NEITHER THE WORKERS NOR THE COMPANIES INVOLVED </p><p>COULD DO SO. VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES, HE SAID, UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>NEED FOR INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE WRONGDOING BUT HOPED THIS </p><p>COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A QUICK MANNER EITHER IN AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA OR BY TAKING DEPOSITIONS FROM THE WORKERS.  HE SAID HE </p><p>SAW NO REAL NEED FOR THESE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO GO TO HAWAII </p><p>BECAUSE IT INCREASED "EXPECTATIONS" OF A POSSIBLE LONGER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00702  01 OF 02  261056Z </p><p>STAY IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5. AMBASSADOR SAID HE REMAINED CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG </p><p>DELAY THAT HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FIRST REPORTED DISPUTES </p><p>IN AMERICAN SAMOA AND THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION </p><p>TO BRING THE WORKERS BACK TO VIETNAM.  THE SITUATION NOW WAS </p><p>COMPLICATED BECAUSE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEGAL ISSUES WERE </p><p>BEING RAISED, INCLUDING BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>FAVOR IMPROVEMENT OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>AND VIETNAM.  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO PUBLICIZE </p><p>THE PROBLEMS AND DISCREDIT VIETNAM ON LARGER GROUNDS.  HE </p><p>URGED THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO </p><p>CARRY OUT THE RETURN OF THE VIETNAMESE WORKERS.  NOTING HE </p><p>WAS UNAWARE OF THE REPORT OF 100 WORKERS BEING TRANSFERRED </p><p>TO HAWAII, AMBASSADOR SAID THIS WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF A </p><p>REQUEST FOR A MORE DETAILED INVESTIGATION BY AMERICAN SAMOA </p><p>AUTHORITIES WHICH HAS NOW PUT THE CASE IN THE HANDS OF THE </p><p>FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  HE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE </p><p>OF ANY SPECIFIC INS RULING ON THE WORKERS STATUS THAT MIGHT </p><p>APPLY TO THEIR GOING TO HAWAII OR TO FURTHER STAYS IN THE </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6.   DCM ASKED HUNG IF ONLY VIETNAMESE COMPANY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HAD BEEN PRESENT IN AMERICAN SAMOA TO TALK </p><p>WITH THE WORKERS ABOUT RETURNING HOME.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THE </p><p>TWO COMPANIES INVOLVED BELONG TO MINISTRIES AND THUS PERHAPS </p><p>THOUGHT THEY WERE INDEED REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00702  02 OF 02  261056Z </p><p>CONCERNS.  DCM SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO DID NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANIES </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS BE PRESENT TO HELP THE </p><p>WORKERS TO RETURN.  AMBASSADOR REITERATED EARLIER </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS THAT VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES THINK ABOUT </p><p>SENDING A BOAT OR PLANE TO PICK UP THE REMAINING WORKERS, </p><p>ASSUMING THE GOVERNMENT COULD PREVAIL UPON THEM THAT IT WAS </p><p>BEST TO RETURN.  HUNG ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WAS VIETNAM\'S GOAL </p><p>BUT SAID VIETNAM "COULD NOT FORCE THESE PEOPLE TO RETURN </p><p>AGAINST THEIR WILL." </p><p> </p><p>7.  HUNG CLAIMED "TOO MANY PEOPLE" WERE ADVISING THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE WORKERS THEY HAD A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO STAY </p><p>PERMANENTLY IN THE U.S.  THIS, HE SAID, WAS CONFUSING THE </p><p>WORKERS.  HE URGED THE U.S. TO TAKE A DEFINITIVE STANCE ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE WHICH WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR </p><p>RESIDENCE IN THE U.S.  HUNG ALSO SAID HE HAD RECEIVED THE </p><p>REPORT OF A MEETING BETWEEN BCLTV DIRECTOR SILVER AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR BANG IN WHICH SILVER PURPORTEDLY MENTIONED THAT </p><p>NUMBER IN OR ENROUTE HONOLULU.  HUNG TOOK NOTE OF THE </p><p>SUGGESTION ABOUT "OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS" BEING INVOLVED </p><p>AND SAID THE VIETNAMESE EMBASSY HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATING OFFICIAL ACTIONS AND HE WAS </p><p>SURE AMBASSADOR BANG HAD BEEN IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH </p><p>AMERICAN SAMOA OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  AMBASSADOR REITERATED USG REQUEST TO VISIT THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS NOW THAT THE SITUATION HAD CALMED AND THE PRESS </p><p>HAD ALREADY VISITED.  HE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>PRESS SPOKESMAN\'S STATEMENT OF MARCH 23 AND EARLIER U.S. </p><p>REQUESTS TO VISIT.  HE SAID THIS WAS THE ONLY TIME HE HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00702  02 OF 02  261056Z </p><p>BEEN REFUSED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL AND THAT HE BELIEVED IT </p><p>WAS TIME TO LET DIPLOMATS RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OPEN </p><p>TRAVEL IN COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID IF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>AUTHORITIES PREFERRED TO HAVE VISITS BY OTHER THAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS HE WAS PREPARED TO HAVE EMBASSY OR CONGEN HCMC </p><p>PERSONNEL TAKE THE FIRST TRIPS.  BUT, HE SAID, THE TIME WAS </p><p>NOW RIPE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE.  HUNG SAID HE WOULD AGAIN </p><p>CONVEY THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST TO TRAVEL TO THE REGION.  HE </p><p>WAS AWARE OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST IN FEBRUARY AS WELL AS </p><p>DCM\'S REQUEST LAST WEEK.  HE SAID HE FELT IT WAS SIMPLY A </p><p>MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS WOULD OCCUR BUT HE DID NOT </p><p>INDICATE HE FELT THAT OUR REQUEST WOULD GET A FAVORABLE </p><p>ANSWER IMMEDIATELY.  (NOTE: EMBASSY AND CONGEN PERSONNEL </p><p>HAVE ALREADY MADE APPLICATION TO TRAVEL TO THE AFFECTED </p><p>REGIONS AND ARE AWAITING FORMAL RESPONSE FROM THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT: VIETNAMESE HAVE LAID THE GROUND WORK TO BLAME </p><p>THE USG IF ANY OF THE HIGHLAND RESIDENTS OF VIETNAM WHO ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY IN CAMBODIA SOMEHOW DO NOT MAKE IT BACK TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  IF THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE STATUS OF THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR SOME FORM OF </p><p>CONSIDERATION AS REFUGEES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO GET UN OR </p><p>OTHER APOLITICAL PERSONNEL INTO THE MIX RIGHT AWAY. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MEETING, AMBASSADOR DISCOVERED E-MAILED WIRE </p><p>SERVICE REPORTS QUOTING CAMBODIAN PM HUN SEN AS SAYING ALL </p><p>OF THE 24 DETAINED VIETNAMESE WOULD BE RETURNED TO VIETNAM. </p><p>HUN SEN IDENTIFIED THESE INDIVIDUALS AS \'REBELS OR </p><p>CRIMINALS\' AND SAID CAMBODIA HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND THEM </p><p>BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.  HUNG WAS CERTAINLY NOT AWARE OF </p><p>THESE REPORTS WHEN HE CALLED THE AMBASSADOR TO COME IN. BUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00702  02 OF 02  261056Z </p><p>HE HAS CLEARLY PUT DOWN A MARKER TO SUGGEST ANY CHANGE IN </p><p>HUN SEN\'S POLICY WILL RESULT IN THE U.S. BEING IDENTIFIED AS </p><p>THE CULPRIT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ON AMERICAN SAMOA WORKER ISSUES, WE\'D APPRECIATE </p><p>CLARIFICATION WHETHER 100 INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN </p><p>REMOVED TO HAWAII.  IF NOT, WE URGE THAT USG AGENCIES </p><p>CONDUCT WHATEVER INVESTIGATIONS ARE NECESSARY IN AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA WITHOUT TAKING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THE U.S.   FAILURE </p><p>TO SO RAISES THE RISK NONE OF THE OTHER WORKERS WILL AGREE </p><p>TO LEAVE AMERICAN SAMOA.  IT ALSO SETS A PRECEDENT FOR </p><p>POSSIBLE FUTURE EFFORTS TO CREATE "CONDITIONS OF WORK" WHICH </p><p>WILL ENABLE UNSCRUPULOUS INDIVIDUALS TO "TRAFFIC" ILLEGAL </p><p>EMIGRANTS TO THE U.S. UNDER THE GUISE OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CONCERNS. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
