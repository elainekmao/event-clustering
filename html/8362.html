<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 001230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREF, PHUM, PREF, PHUM, HR, HRPGOV, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING THE HDZ AT ARM\'S LENGTH </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 519 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE USG WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE HDZ AT ARM\'S LENGTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01230  01 OF 02  300952Z </p><p>UNTIL IT HAS DEMONSTRATED -- IN ACTIONS, NOT JUST WORDS -- </p><p>THAT IT WILL SUPPORT POLICIES WHICH ADVANCE OUR STRATEGY FOR </p><p>ACHIEVING STABILITY IN THE REGION.  THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DELIVERED TO HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADER OVER LUNCH </p><p>ON MAY 27.  THE HDZ CONTINUES TO TAKE A POSITIVE LINE ON SOME </p><p>TOUGH BILATERAL ISSUES WHERE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS NOT </p><p>(LIKE IRAQ AND THE ICC), BUT HAS MADE NO PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>BENCHMARKS SET BY THE AMBASSADOR ON ICTY COOPERATION, REFUGEE </p><p>RETURNS AND INTERNAL PARTY REFORMS.  SANADER SAID HE IS </p><p>"DEEPLY CONVINCED" OF THE VITAL ROLE OF THE U.S. AS THE </p><p>GUARANTOR OF SECURITY IN EUROPE AND PLEDGED THAT STRONG TIES </p><p>WITH THE U.S. WILL BE A TOP PRIORITY SHOULD THE HDZ RETURN TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT AFTER PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>UNTIL THE NEXT PARLIAMENT IS SEATED, HE HAS LITTLE FREEDOM TO </p><p>ACT ON SOME POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ISSUES, BUT PROMISED THAT </p><p>AN HDZ GOVERNMENT (IF ELECTED) WOULD PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS </p><p>ON THESE ISSUES THAN THE CURRENT COALITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOW-UP TO FEBRUARY MEETING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON MAY 27, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH HDZ PRESIDENT IVO </p><p>SANADER OVER LUNCH TO FOLLOW UP THEIR INITIAL MEETING ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 21 (REFTEL).  WITH SANADER WAS MIOMIR ZUZUL, </p><p>FORMERLY CROATIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., WHO PARTICIPATED </p><p>ACTIVELY IN THE DISCUSSION.  AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, SANADER </p><p>HAD EXPRESSED KEEN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING CLOSER TIES WITH </p><p>THE EMBASSY WITH A VIEW TOWARD SHOWING CROATIAN VOTERS -- AND </p><p>POTENTIAL COALITION PARTNERS -- THAT THE HDZ "REFORMS" HAVE </p><p>BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE USG.  AT THAT SAME MEETING, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD SET OUT A SERIES OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS THE HDZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01230  01 OF 02  300952Z </p><p>NEEDED TO TAKE ON ISSUES RELATING TO REGIONAL SECURITY IN </p><p>ORDER TO GET THE U.S. VALIDATION THEY SO AVIDLY SOUGHT. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ\'S SOLID SUPPORT ON IRAQ, ARTICLE 98 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT THE USG RECOGNIZES </p><p>THE STRONG SUPPORT THE HDZ HAS GIVEN TO THE U.S. ON TOUGH </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES, ESPECIALLY ON IRAQ AND MORE RECENTLY IN </p><p>CALLING FOR CROATIAN TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH THE </p><p>U.S.  SANADER SAID HE IS "DEEPLY CONVINCED" THAT THE </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS ESSENTIAL TO EUROPEAN SECURITY. </p><p> HE REGRETS THE CURRENT COALITION\'S ACTIONS WHICH HAVE </p><p>DAMAGED THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE HDZ RECOGNIZES THAT CROATIA\'S </p><p>FUTURE IS IN EUROPE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE </p><p>BALANCE, RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF THE USG.  IN AN HDZ </p><p>GOVERNMENT, RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. WILL BE A HIGHER </p><p>PRIORITY, SANADER DECLARED.  HE REJECTED THE ANALYSIS BY MANY </p><p>IN THE MEDIA THAT HE HAS TAKEN PRO-U.S. POSITIONS ONLY TO GET </p><p>OUR APPROVAL FOR THE REFORMS HE IS CARRYING OUT.  THE </p><p>EUROPEAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY GAVE THE HDZ THE ONLY "SEAL OF </p><p>APPROVAL" IT NEEDED WHEN IT VOTED TO GRANT THE HDZ OBSERVER </p><p>STATUS IN THE EPP. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR: NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS ON KEY ISSUES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOOK NOTE OF THE CHANGES IN THE HDZ IN </p><p>THE PAST THREE YEARS; WITHOUT THEM EVEN THE RECENT LIMITED </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH SANADER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.  BUT </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01230  01 OF 02  300952Z </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD THE BENCHMARKS SET DURING THEIR FIRST </p><p>MEETING.  THE AMBASSADOR REITERATED THE STEPS THE HDZ NEEDS </p><p>TO TAKE BEFORE THE U.S. CAN CONSIDER ENGAGING THE PARTY AS A </p><p>SERIOUS PARTNER. </p><p> </p><p>- INTERNAL REFORMS </p><p> </p><p>PARTY "REFORM" MUST MOVE BEYOND POLITICAL HOUSECLEANING. </p><p>LJUBO CESIC-ROJS, AN OUTRAGEOUS NATIONALIST FIGURE WHO </p><p>CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY DISRUPT INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EFFORTS </p><p>TOWARD ACHIEVING REGIONAL STABILITY, REMAINS IN THE PARTY, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH SANADER HAD TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN FEBRUARY THAT </p><p>HE WAS ON THE WAY OUT.  BRANIMIR GLAVAS, THE OSIJEK WARLORD </p><p>SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN SEVERAL WAR CRIMES, CONTINUES TO </p><p>HOLD A POSITION OF SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE HDZ. </p><p> </p><p>- ICTY COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIABLE ISSUE.  WE LOOK FOR A PUBLIC </p><p>DECLARATION THAT THE HDZ WILL NOT SEEK TO CHANGE THE ICTY </p><p>COOPERATION LAW IF IT GETS INTO GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THE HDZ </p><p>WILL ABIDE BY THE LAW, PROMPTLY SERVE INDICTMENTS AND MAKE A </p><p>GOOD-FAITH EFFORT TO FIND ICTY INDICTEES. </p><p> </p><p>- REFUGEE RETURN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4130 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01230  02 OF 02  300953Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /006W </p><p>                  ------------------6CF374  300953Z /38 </p><p>P 300933Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0359 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREF, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING THE HDZ AT ARM\'S LENGTH </p><p> </p><p>AS IN FEBRUARY, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT HE NEEDS TO </p><p>MAKE HIS PARTY POLICY ON THIS ISSUE CLEAR AND THEN PUBLICLY </p><p>CALL FOR HDZ MEMBERS IN RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS TO FOLLOW THIS </p><p>POLICY.  SOME LOCAL-LEVEL HDZ LEADERS ARE ACTIVELY </p><p>OBSTRUCTING RETURN.  SANADER HASN\'T TAKEN THIS ISSUE UP.  WE </p><p>WOULD NEED TO SEE A CLEAR AND PUBLIC STATEMENT ON THIS ISSUE </p><p>NOW. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01230  02 OF 02  300953Z </p><p> </p><p>SANADER: "MY HANDS ARE TIED" </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AS HE DID IN FEBRUARY, SANADER EXPLAINED THAT HE IS A </p><p>"HOSTAGE TO THE PARTY CAUCUS" IN THE PARLIAMENT, ALL OF WHOM </p><p>WERE SELECTED BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED AS HDZ PRESIDENT AND MANY </p><p>OF WHOM RESIST HIS EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM THE HDZ INTO A </p><p>MAINSTREAM CENTER-RIGHT PARTY.  HE NOW SEEKS CHANGES TO THE </p><p>HDZ BY-LAWS WHICH WILL TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>DETERMINING WHO WILL BE ON PARTY CANDIDATE LISTS FROM THE </p><p>100-MEMBER HDZ "EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE" TO THE 13-MEMBER PARTY </p><p>PRESIDENCY, OVER WHICH HE HAS FIRM CONTROL.  IF HE SUCCEEDS </p><p>IN MAKING THIS CHANGE AT THE JUNE 21 PARTY CONGRESS, HE PLANS </p><p>TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PARTY </p><p>CAUCUS, WITH MORE THAN 80 PERCENT "NEW BLOOD" IN THE NEXT </p><p>PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ON CESIC-ROJS, SANADER AGREED THAT IT IS TIME FOR </p><p>ROJS TO GO, AND PROMISED HE WOULD BE OUT AFTER THE JUNE HDZ </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS.  HE GAVE NO GROUND ON GLAVAS, INSISTING THAT </p><p>AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED GLAVAS\' ONLY PROBLEM IS ONE OF </p><p>IMAGE; HE HAS NO INFORMATION WHICH HE CONSIDERS CREDIBLE </p><p>IMPLICATING GLAVAS OF ANY WRONGDOING.  HE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT GLAVAS\' AGGRESSIVE APPROACH IS A LIABILITY FOR THE HDZ. </p><p>SANADER POINTED OUT THAT IF THE CHANGES TO PARTY BY-LAWS HE </p><p>SEEKS ARE APPROVED, THE ROLE OF THE PARTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </p><p>-- OF WHICH GLAVAS IS A MEMBER -- WILL BE REDUCED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ON TAKING A PUBLIC, PROACTIVE STANCE ON ISSUES </p><p>RELATING TO ICTY COOPERATION AND REFUGEE RETURN, SANADER SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01230  02 OF 02  300953Z </p><p>THAT UNTIL HE HAS A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF HIS </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION, HIS HANDS WILL BE TIED.  THE HDZ </p><p>HAS, SANADER ARGUED, TAKEN THE LEAD ON SOME PROGRESSIVE </p><p>POLICIES.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO PASS A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES (CLNM) WAS </p><p>FOUNDERING IN BITTER ARGUMENTS WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LEADERS </p><p>UNTIL THE HDZ -- SANADER PERSONALLY -- STEPPED IN TO BROKER A </p><p>COMPROMISE.  NOW, CROATIA\'S CLNM IS BROADLY PRAISED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  REMOVING RIVAL IVIC PASALIC FROM A </p><p>POSITION OF POWER DID MORE THAN JUST CLEAN HOUSE IN THE HDZ, </p><p>SANADER CONTINUED; IT ALSO REMOVED A SOURCE OF INAPPROPRIATE </p><p>INFLUENCE OVER THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, PAVING THE WAY FOR </p><p>THEIR REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SANADER MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR THE EMBASSY TO BEGIN </p><p>TREATING THE HDZ AS IT DOES OTHER CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, </p><p>INCLUDING ALLOWING IT TO PARTICIPATE IN ONGOING USAID </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AIMED AT BUILDING POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>CAPACITY.  THE AMBASSADOR DID NOT APOLOGIZE FOR SETTING A </p><p>HIGH BAR FOR THE HDZ TO CLEAR, HIGHER THAN OTHER PARTIES, </p><p>BEFORE HE WOULD CONSIDER RECOMMENDING THAT THE USG ENGAGE </p><p>MORE CLOSELY WITH SANADER\'S PARTY.  THE HDZ WAS DIRECTLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DESTABILIZING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE </p><p>POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND WOULD HAVE TO DO MORE </p><p>THAN DISCUSS POLICY CHANGES IN PRIVATE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPLAINED.  SANADER SAID HE UNDERSTOOD, REPEATED HIS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, AND </p><p>DECLARED THAT AN HDZ GOVERNMENT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND </p><p>WOULD PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD NATO </p><p>MEMBERSHIP.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT THE USG WOULD </p><p>RECOGNIZE REAL HDZ REFORM WHENEVER IT CAME -- BEFORE OR AFTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01230  02 OF 02  300953Z </p><p>ELECTIONS -- AND RESPOND ACCORDINGLY, BUT NOT UNTIL THAT </p><p>REFORM WAS VISIBLE AND CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) AS HE DID IN FEBRUARY, SANADER STRUCK US AS </p><p>PERSONALLY GENUINE.  DESPITE HIS ASSURANCES ABOUT HIS </p><p>EAGERNESS TO IMPROVE HIS PARTY\'S STANDING WITH THE U.S., WE </p><p>DO NOT EXPECT HE WILL MEET THE BENCHMARKS WE SET, AT LEAST </p><p>NOT BEFORE THE NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  WE EXPECT </p><p>SANADER WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE CHANGES TO PARTY BY-LAWS </p><p>HE OUTLINED TO US DURING THE NEXT PARTY CONVENTION, BUT WE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE: POLITICAL HOUSECLEANING, </p><p>NOT DEMOCRATIC REFORM OF THE PARTY.  ONCE HE HAS ALL THE </p><p>REINS IN HIS OWN HANDS, SANADER WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANY </p><p>EXCUSES FOR NOT DELIVERING.  UNTIL THE HDZ DEMONSTRATES -- </p><p>WITH ACTIONS, NOT JUST PRIVATE STATEMENTS -- THAT IT IS A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY READY TO WORK FOR STABILITY IN THE REGION, </p><p>WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD IT AT ARM\'S LENGTH. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
