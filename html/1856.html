<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001957 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: EINV, PGOV, ECON, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  (C) NIGERIA: PRIVATIZATION DIRECTOR TO QUIT JOB </p><p>OVER GSM EQUIPMENT CONTRACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1679 (B) LAGOS 1933 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for Reasons 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  Ambassador Jeter hosted Nasir El-Rufai, </p><p>Director-General of the Bureau for Public Enterprises (BPE), </p><p>for lunch on August 1 to discuss the current status of the </p><p>NITEL GSM Equipment contract.  EconOff attended as notetaker. </p><p> El-Rufai was very candid about his relationship with the </p><p>Vice President, the Vice President,s stake in awarding the </p><p>GSM contract to Ericsson, and his own intention to leave his </p><p>position as head of the GON privatization agency.  El-Rufai </p><p>claimed that the Vice President had manipulated the contract </p><p>award in favor of Ericsson and that this case is just one </p><p>example of what is commonly practiced in the Executive </p><p>branch, e.g., cushioning or manipulating contracts for </p><p>personal and political gain.  He stated that because the </p><p>President believes him capable of manipulating the tendering </p><p>process, as alleged by Ericsson, he has no other choice but </p><p>to resign his position at the BPE.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 1, Ambassador hosted a private lunch for </p><p>Nasir El-Rufai to candidly discuss the NITEL GSM Equipment </p><p>contract, valued at approximately USD 40 million.  (See </p><p>reftels for background on this issue.)  In the intimate </p><p>setting of the Ambassador,s residence, El-Rufai stated that </p><p>NITEL/Ministry of Communications was continuing to negotiate </p><p>the contract terms with Ericsson.  According to El-Rufai, the </p><p>GON asked Ericsson to deliver the products and services at </p><p>Motorola\'s bid price, which was USD 10 million less than </p><p>Ericsson\'s bid of USD 49 million.  El-Rufai did not believe </p><p>Ericsson could fulfill the contract provisions at that price, </p><p>commenting that conclusion would only be reached if the two </p><p>sides agreed to cut 25 percent of the contract, through, for </p><p>example, reducing the number of proposed base stations.  But, </p><p>El-Rufai said, "that 25 percent would have to be paid for by </p><p>someone." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) When asked whether the President and Vice President </p><p>might reconsider the contract award, El-Rufai replied no, </p><p>despite the difficulties over negotiations, the Vice </p><p>President would "lose face" if Ericsson did not receive the </p><p>contract.  However, El-Rufai did feel that a compromise could </p><p>be found that would allow the Vice President to save face and </p><p>allow Motorola to participate.  He suggested that Ericsson </p><p>and Motorola split the contract: Ericsson could provide the </p><p>switching network and Motorola could provide the base </p><p>stations.  He noted that this would allow each company to </p><p>provide the service in which it specializes.  Because the </p><p>base stations represent a greater portion of the contract, he </p><p>recommended offering Ericsson some of the sub-contracting </p><p>work, such as the air conditioning towers and power </p><p>generation units, where neither company has specific </p><p>expertise.  (Comment.  El-Rufai\'s suggestions may not carry </p><p>much weight, as he is not currently participating in the </p><p>negotiations with Ericsson.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) El-Rufai expressed his deep displeasure with events </p><p>immediately preceding the contract award to Ericsson.  In a </p><p>recent meeting with President Obasanjo, the two discussed </p><p>Ericsson\'s allegations that El-Rufai had manipulated the </p><p>tendering process to ensure Motorola\'s success.  (Note. </p><p>El-Rufai had written a lengthy letter to President Obasanjo </p><p>on July 8 defending his role in the tendering process and </p><p>pointing to the questionable activities of the Vice </p><p>President\'s Aide-de-Camp, who acted on behalf of Ericsson. </p><p>At the time of El-Rufai\'s meeting with Obasanjo, however, the </p><p>President had not read this letter.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) El-Rufai commented that he would have preferred to </p><p>wait until the President had read his letter before </p><p>discussing it with him.  During the meeting, President </p><p>Obasanjo told El-Rufai that he had total confidence in the </p><p>BPE Director-General, but that he believed El-Rufai was </p><p>clever enough to have manipulated the tendering process from </p><p>the outset to ensure Motorola\'s success.  The President then </p><p>said that El-Rufai had three problems: first, that there was </p><p>a popular perception that El-Rufai is "too clever"; second, </p><p>in fact, he is "too clever"; and third, his attitude towards </p><p>Ministers and the Vice President is not sufficiently </p><p>respectful or deferential. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) El-Rufai asked the President for permission to sue </p><p>Ericsson for defamation.  Obasanjo reportedly refused this </p><p>request because of the negative political repercussions on </p><p>the Presidency.  The President then asked El-Rufai what else </p><p>he could do for him.  El-Rufai requested permission to leave </p><p>his position as Director-General of the BPE.  El-Rufai argued </p><p>with the President that he could not oversee the country\'s </p><p>privatization program if Obasanjo believed that El-Rufai was </p><p>capable of manipulating the tendering process.  However, </p><p>El-Rufai said, the President refused to allow him to quit. </p><p>7. (C) El-Rufai confided to the Ambassador that despite the </p><p>President\'s refusal, he still intended to leave the BPE after </p><p>a 2-3 month period.  He said that he would not leave too soon </p><p>after the GSM Equipment tendering in order to avoid </p><p>speculation over the causes for his departure.  El-Rufai </p><p>added that over the next few months he would expose his </p><p>deputy, Tijjani Abdullahi, and the Legal Department Head, to </p><p>his contacts at the Presidency in hopes that the President </p><p>would choose one of them as his successor.  However, he </p><p>admitted that neither of them had political connections or a </p><p>close relationship with the Presidency.  El-Rufai asked for </p><p>the support of the donor community in advocating for the new </p><p>BPE Director-General to come from within the agency\'s ranks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter expressed sincere regret that </p><p>El-Rufai had decided to leave public service.  The Ambassador </p><p>believed that the privatization program would severely suffer </p><p>and so would Nigeria.  While El-Rufai seemed to appreciate </p><p>these sentiments, he did not soften his position on leaving </p><p>the job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) El-Rufai also showed a great deal of resentment toward </p><p>Ericsson and promised to "get them" at a later time.  He said </p><p>that "time is on my side" and that he was sure that sometime </p><p>in the future Ericsson would need his help and he would be </p><p>able to refuse them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) The Ambassador asked about the quality of El-Rufai\'s </p><p>personal relationship with the Vice President, noting that in </p><p>public their relationship had always appeared close. </p><p>El-Rufai replied that, yes, he had believed their </p><p>relationship was good.  He commented that the Vice President </p><p>had never asked him to do anything unsavory or to "bring him </p><p>deals."  He said, however that a friend heard from former </p><p>Senate President Chuba Okadigabo, who is close with the Vice </p><p>President and helps him to "raise money" for the campaign war </p><p>chest, that the Vice President was unhappy with El-Rufai\'s </p><p>performance because El-Rufai had never brought him a single </p><p>"deal" (read kickbacks). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) El-Rufai explained that the Vice President worked </p><p>through the Ministers, particularly the Minister of Works and </p><p>Housing, to manipulate public contracts for both building the </p><p>campaign war chest for the 2003 Presidential elections and, </p><p>he assumed, for personal gain.  El-Rufai said that the </p><p>President was not a wealthy man and would not likely receive </p><p>campaign support from his supporters during the last </p><p>election.  (Comment.  The PDP party itself is barely solvent </p><p>and would not be able to offer the President much financial </p><p>support.  End Comment.)  Therefore, El-Rufai said, the </p><p>President was tacitly complicit in the Vice President\'s "fund </p><p>raising" activities, but never involved himself directly so </p><p>as to "stay clean."  El-Rufai commented that the Vice </p><p>President came from a "dirty" background in the Customs </p><p>Service and had continued these practices in the Villa. </p><p>El-Rufai implied that the NITEL GSM Equipment contract was an </p><p>example of such activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Comment.  Many in the international community respect </p><p>Nasir El-Rufai for his integrity and forthrightness. </p><p>El-Rufai\'s departure from public service would be a </p><p>devastating blow to the GON\'s image of transparency and good </p><p>economic governance.  Embassy officers have heard many times </p><p>from many sources that the Vice President is directly </p><p>involved in corrupt activities.  El-Rufai\'s testimony </p><p>provides more anecdotal evidence supporting these sources. </p><p>With El-Rufai gone, the Vice President will be more able to </p><p>manipulate the country\'s privatization process for personal </p><p>and political gain.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
