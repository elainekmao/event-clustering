<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL-J. MARKSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 3/30/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - OPPOSITION PARTIES IN MARCH MEETING </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Begin Summary: During a March 10 meeting with </p><p>numerous opposition political party leaders, </p><p>Ambassador implored the group to do their utmost to </p><p>conduct fair and credible elections in April, to </p><p>eschew violence, and not to condemn and compromise the </p><p>process before it is started.  He cautioned that West </p><p>Africa was already suffering an overdose of turmoil; a </p><p>downward slide in Nigeria would only compound the </p><p>region\'s troubles.  The opposition party leaders </p><p>complained that INEC was simply an instrumentality of </p><p>the governing People\'s Democratic Party.  (The PDP was </p><p>invited to the meeting but did not show.) They </p><p>denigrated INEC\'s elections preparation, particularly </p><p>its handling of voter\'s registration.  The politicians </p><p>claimed that INEC was working to ensure that President </p><p>Obasanjo was reelected.  Although avowing peaceful </p><p>intentions, the party leaders warned of unrest should </p><p>the President be returned through an electoral process </p><p>that, for them, has the appearance of an increasingly </p><p>stacked deck.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>INEC Cannot be Trusted </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Due to a gale of criticism by political </p><p>parties about the electoral process, the Ambassador </p><p>called a March 10 meeting of all political parties to </p><p>hear their views and to let them know USG expectations </p><p>regarding the electoral process.  Although invited, </p><p>the ruling PDP did not attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Ambassador Jeter emphasized that Nigeria was </p><p>entering an historic period, not only for itself but </p><p>the entire sub-region.  With Cote d\'Ivoire teetering </p><p>on the brink of a possible civil war and Liberia an </p><p>area of chronic turmoil, West Africa was awash in </p><p>instability, he stressed.  While Nigeria is the giant </p><p>and leader in West Africa, a poor election here would </p><p>finish the region in the eyes of the world; therefore </p><p>these elections were not only important to Nigeria but </p><p>to West Africa and indeed the entire African </p><p>continent.  Unfortunately, the Ambassador stated, </p><p>things were not proceeding smoothly.  The political </p><p>violence being committed by all sides was a huge </p><p>problem; moreover, INEC\'s poor performance also was a </p><p>major concern.  Furthermore, too many politicians had </p><p>made the leap from criticism of INEC\'S poor </p><p>performance to accusing it of rigging.  Politicians </p><p>might gain points among their partisans with the </p><p>accusations but they were also laying the groundwork </p><p>to have the elections seen as null and void even </p><p>before they were held.  This was dangerous, the </p><p>Ambassador said.  Not only could it delegitimize the </p><p>process and ultimately the elections, it could foment </p><p>post-election unrest and violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Ambassador called on all the parties to </p><p>work toward free, fair and credible elections.  After </p><p>making this appeal, Ambassador Jeter and the USAID </p><p>Director then provided a brief overview of USG </p><p>electoral assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Voter\'s Registration - A Chimera </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  After thanking the Ambassador for hosting </p><p>the meeting, ANPP National Chairman Don Etiebet stated </p><p>that he "shared" the Ambassador\'s concerns.  Then, in </p><p>effect, he did what the Ambassador cautioned against. </p><p>Etiebet claimed the elections would not be "credible, </p><p>free or fair."  He declared that INEC was the agent of </p><p>the government and PDP.  The Obasanjo Administration, </p><p>he claimed, was determined to win by any means despite </p><p>its patent unpopularity.  The government was petrified </p><p>by a free and fair election because it would lose </p><p>handsomely; therefore, the Government and PDP would </p><p>resort to election trickery, violence and intimidation </p><p>to mask their shortcomings.  Unfortunately, the very </p><p>agencies--the Police and State Security Service--that </p><p>could prevent foul play, are as deeply in the PDP </p><p>pocket as INEC, Etiebet contended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Etiebet went on to claim that ANPP </p><p>campaigning has been thwarted by PDP governors.  The </p><p>governors claim to be the "commander-in-chief" of </p><p>their state with the army, police and SSS at their </p><p>disposal.  They wield power but not popularity.  If </p><p>they are reelected by a fraudulent process, the people </p><p>will denounce it.  Etiebet asserted the elections in </p><p>1999 were "child\'s play" compared to the next four </p><p>weeks.  While bereft of specific recommendations, he </p><p>asked that, in addition to election monitoring, the </p><p>international community become more involved now or </p><p>else be faced with doing "peace keeping" later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Etiebet and a few other opposition leaders </p><p>encouraged the USG to voice our concerns about the </p><p>election publicly.  While the government would </p><p>chastise the United States for interfering in </p><p>Nigeria\'s internal affairs, statements of </p><p>international concern could have a positive effect and </p><p>would be supported across the political spectrum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Regarding security for the electoral </p><p>process, Ambassador Jeter mentioned he had recently </p><p>met Police Service Commission Chairman Okeke.  At that </p><p>meeting Okeke stated his willingness to meet political </p><p>party officials to discuss the role of the police and </p><p>to underscore the police\'s neutrality.  (Comment: That </p><p>meeting has since taken place under INEC\'s auspices. </p><p>The Police Services Commission plans to field its own </p><p>"monitors" to observe and regulate police behavior </p><p>during the elections.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The UNPP Chairman launched a broadside at </p><p>INEC, claiming it had fumbled voters registration.  He </p><p>stated that INEC claims of having posted the voters </p><p>list in most states were fabricated, and that lists </p><p>were published in only a small fraction of local </p><p>government areas.  Even there, INEC had problems.  The </p><p>UNPP Chairman cited an example of people in a local </p><p>government in Borno State checking the list only to </p><p>find that the roster belonged to an area in Plateau </p><p>State.  He claimed to have searched for a published </p><p>list in his ward but could not find one.  With one </p><p>month to the election, he lamented the fact that, as a </p><p>national official of a political party, he was unsure </p><p>if he had been officially registered.  The irony of </p><p>this statement was not lost on the meeting\'s other </p><p>participants who echoed similar concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The NDP Chairman announced that his party </p><p>had sued INEC for non-compliance with the Electoral </p><p>Act.  He claimed that INEC was required to publish the </p><p>voters list prior to announcing the election date; </p><p>moreover, the list should have been published at least </p><p>sixty days prior to the election.  To date, only three </p><p>states had completed and published their lists, he </p><p>claimed.  Because of the failure of INEC to timely </p><p>post the list, holding elections in April would be </p><p>illegal.  This was the issue on which the NDP had </p><p>taken INEC to court </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The APGA representative observed that the </p><p>PDP rarely attended INEC meeting with other political </p><p>parties.  The PDP\'s absence led to the suspicion that </p><p>INEC was the guarantor of the PDP\'s interest; thus, </p><p>the PDP did not have to attend the meetings. </p><p>(Comment: In a subsequent meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>the INEC Chairman refuted this allegation, claiming </p><p>that INEC calls frequent meetings with political </p><p>parties, but most fail to attend.  We believe the </p><p>Chairman is telling the truth.  End comment.)  He also </p><p>questioned the transparency of the selection process </p><p>of local polling agents by INEC, complaining that </p><p>opposition parties had no input into the selection </p><p>system or eligibility criteria.  The Resident INEC </p><p>Commissioner in a state unilaterally selected the </p><p>staff; in turn, that Commission was appointed by the </p><p>President.  There was no check against the </p><p>Commissioner hiring a PDP loyalist.  The selection </p><p>process was too subject to arbitrariness to produce a </p><p>good crop of polling officials.  The ANPP Chairman </p><p>interjected that the real skullduggery would be at the </p><p>local level, particularly in remote areas.  What </p><p>happens outside the spotlight, in the small hamlets </p><p>across the country, will determine the election; </p><p>deploying observers to Lagos, Abuja and Kano, in his </p><p>opinion, will not give one an accurate account. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  The Peoples Salvation Party Chairman </p><p>accused INEC of even changing parties\' candidate list. </p><p>For reasons clear only to INEC, he said, names </p><p>announced by the Commission as the final party </p><p>candidates were not always those submitted by, in many </p><p>instances, the parties.  The UNPP Chairman warned that </p><p>INEC planned to use polling stations on election day </p><p>different than the venues used for voters </p><p>registration.  This would confuse voters and allow for </p><p>rigging at the new, unknown sites.  To prevent this, </p><p>he demanded that INEC quickly publish a list of </p><p>polling stations and their locations.  Thereafter, any </p><p>station not on the list, would be illegal and ballots </p><p>allegedly cast should not be recognized.  (Comment: </p><p>INEC has performed poorly in many areas.  In all </p><p>fairness, however, INEC has repeatedly announced that </p><p>the sites used for voters registration will be the </p><p>same locations used on election day. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The Movement for Democracy and Justice </p><p>(MDJ) Chairman focused on the lack of voter education </p><p>as a major flaw.  He stated this task should be the </p><p>joint responsibility of INEC and the parties. </p><p>Elaborating, he claimed that the parties could not </p><p>develop their election day deployment strategies </p><p>because INEC had not divulged the polling stations. </p><p>He feared a repeat of 1999 where many polling stations </p><p>in his state were designated at the last minute.  He </p><p>also said the political parties needed to be better </p><p>educated about the role of the police, presiding </p><p>polling officers and other poll officials at the </p><p>voting stations.  This knowledge was needed so that </p><p>political party agents could be informed observers but </p><p>also avoid running afoul of the police or polling </p><p>agents.  (In the past, political party agents were </p><p>often falsely arrested and detained until after the </p><p>voting.)  The MDJ Chieftain commented that the failure </p><p>of INEC to inform parties about the process for filing </p><p>complaints and objections on election day also was a </p><p>major flaw. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) The MDJ Chairman further warned that </p><p>declaration of results could be a problem.  In </p><p>Nigeria, the media has a vital role to play but major </p><p>media houses were being financially influenced by the </p><p>Government.  If the media prematurely declared a </p><p>result, this would be taken as a fait accompli by the </p><p>people; the other parties would be hard pressed to </p><p>overcome the perception created, even if inaccurate. </p><p>However, neither INEC nor the Ministry of Information </p><p>had informed the parties about the process for </p><p>disseminating the results, the Chairman declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  The Justice Party Chairman chimed in that </p><p>vote tabulation was fertile ground for fraud.  He </p><p>suggested the political parties should be allowed to </p><p>monitor vote tabulation at every level from the local </p><p>polling station through the ward to the local </p><p>government headquarters, to the state and then the </p><p>national compilation.  "If the political parties are </p><p>kept in the dark, that will be bad," he proclaimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16  (SBU)  Ambassador commented that the USG was doing </p><p>what it could to enhance the integrity and speed of </p><p>the tabulation process.  He mentioned IRI\'s training </p><p>of polling agents, the provision of tamper evident </p><p>envelopes and ballot box seals by IFES for the safe </p><p>transport of ballots and tabulations and the provision </p><p>of a satellite phone system to call in results from </p><p>approximately 150 of Nigeria\'s most isolated areas. </p><p>He also mentioned the IRI and NDI observer teams, and </p><p>the significant USG investment made in local </p><p>monitoring groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The Head of the New Democrats (ND) </p><p>complained that the campaign playing field was </p><p>massively skewed.  Mass media was in the hands of </p><p>government, and PDP campaign activities were being </p><p>aired liberally.  In contrast, the PDP was paying the </p><p>media houses to black-out other campaigns; opposition </p><p>parties received only minimal coverage, which gave the </p><p>false impression of inactivity and weakness.  He </p><p>claimed that the parties needed funding to counter the </p><p>PDP tactics.  However, the PRP representative </p><p>counseled that the opposition parties should not be </p><p>quick in their indictment of the ruling PDP.   "If </p><p>some of us were in power, we would be doing the same </p><p>thing," he admitted.  Instead of complaining about the </p><p>PDP\'s media advantages, he suggested the other parties </p><p>explore creative, low cost ways to get their message </p><p>out.  He asserted that TV and newspapers reached only </p><p>a small percentage of the population in any event, and </p><p>suggested the parties focus more on radio and poster </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>VIOLENCE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  The National Secretary of Nigerian Action </p><p>Party (NAP) said he was frightened by the prospect of </p><p>more political violence.  Violence was widespread and, </p><p>in many instances, the perpetrators were well-known. </p><p>However, these notorious criminals were allowed to </p><p>roam about with impunity.  Because of the violence and </p><p>INEC\'s logistical shortfalls, he claimed the election </p><p>seemed artificial and imposed on the Nigerian public, </p><p>with a predetermined outcome seemingly at hand.  The </p><p>government controlled both the mechanics and the </p><p>economics of the running an election and with that </p><p>advantage, it sought to unduly guide the outcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) The Chairman and Presidential candidate for </p><p>the African Renaissance Party argued that the election </p><p>was beyond repair.  He called for an interim </p><p>government with the sole mandate to prepare for </p><p>elections within six months.  (Comment: At this </p><p>meeting, few people endorsed his idea.  However, at a </p><p>late March meeting of opposition parties, 15 backed </p><p>the interim government idea.  This is symptomatic of </p><p>growing unease and disaffection with the elections. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) Pointing to the high level of violence, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter asked if "the prize (winning the </p><p>election) was worth the cost?"  He encouraged the </p><p>parties to endorse the Code of Conduct.  He reminded </p><p>them that they all needed to behave with tolerance and </p><p>understanding.  Election rigging by anyone was </p><p>inexcusable.  However, the parties needed to recognize </p><p>that INEC started late and lacked resources; its </p><p>management of this massive logistical affair would be </p><p>less than ideal.  They should not expect perfection </p><p>but they should work to make the process credible, </p><p>albeit awkwardly wrought.  He added that this election </p><p>was also laying the groundwork for a more orderly </p><p>process in the future; precedents were being </p><p>established that would not have to be debated or </p><p>litigated in 2007.  In essence, what was taking place </p><p>now was part of Nigeria\'s transition to democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU)  While the attempt to computerize voters </p><p>registration was causing heartburn now, it would pay </p><p>dividends in 2007 and beyond, the Ambassador said. </p><p>Unfortunately, the computerization effort started late </p><p>and that had been a source of many problems in the </p><p>process.  Also, the decision to allow over 30 </p><p>political parties complicated logistics and threw off </p><p>the electoral schedule because the decision came late </p><p>in the sequence of electoral events.  However, it </p><p>opened up the political space.  In future elections, </p><p>both voters and prospective office-holders would have </p><p>a wider choice regarding where to place their </p><p>allegiance.  The Ambassador said that there had been </p><p>lots of litigation, and ultimately that litigation </p><p>would pay off.  (Comment: By March 31, all parties, </p><p>except the NDP and the largest two, the PDP and ANPP, </p><p>had signed the Code of Conduct.  PDP and ANPP have </p><p>said they endorsed the Code but they were feuding over </p><p>which party should sign first. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU) In concluding the meeting, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>mentioned that he would suggest to INEC Chairman that </p><p>INEC convene a meeting of party Chairmen and officials </p><p>from the GON security agencies to discuss ways to </p><p>tackle violence and upgrade electoral security. </p><p>(Note: This was done.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) Comment: Turn-out was excellent and the </p><p>meeting with the parties was most useful.  We were </p><p>able to hear their concerns and grievances while also </p><p>expressing our expectations regarding the elections. </p><p>As the election moves even closer, anxiety is mounting </p><p>and the rhetoric becoming sharper.  As we have been </p><p>doing already, we will use these final days before the </p><p>elections to continue to rush INEC.  While it cannot </p><p>do much to redress the lapses with voter\'s </p><p>registration, many of INEC\'s previous sins will be </p><p>forgiven to the extent that the Commission can </p><p>credibly carry out its duties on election day and </p><p>tabulate the votes without cries of foul. </p><p>Additionally, we also plan to meet the Chairman of the </p><p>ANPP and PDP this week to urge them to sign the Code </p><p>of Conduct before the National Assembly elections on </p><p>April 12. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
