<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000946 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR E, EB, AF/W AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 22 MAY 2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, EAID, NI, XA </p><p>SUBJECT:  Abuja NePAD Summit and Evian G-8: Africans </p><p>Uneasy About Larger Circle </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: 02 Abuja 1913 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Andrews.  Reason: 1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Nigeria\'s NePAD guru says Africans </p><p>uneasy about expanding G-8 dialogue to other </p><p>developing countries and limiting discussion to growth </p><p>and international cooperation. The Africans also want </p><p>the G-8 to break market-access "gridlock" in Geneva. </p><p>Abuja NePAD Summit set for afternoon of May 28.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DCM May 22 attended a briefing for G-8 COMs at </p><p>the French Ambassador\'s residence.  Ambassador Isaac </p><p>Aluko-Olokun from the Ministry of Cooperation and </p><p>Integration in Africa was the briefer.  French DCM </p><p>hosted.  All G-8 country missions and the EC were </p><p>represented at the one-hour session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While formally welcoming more developing </p><p>countries to the dialogue with the G-8 and profusely </p><p>thanking the G-8 for its "generosity in bringing </p><p>Africa to global attention," Aluko-Olokun suggested </p><p>many African states were growing uneasy about the </p><p>larger group expected at Evian.  Africa would preserve </p><p>its special status, Aluko-Olokun agreed, but, like a </p><p>senior wife who sees a younger co-spouse entering the </p><p>household, there were fears of marginalization.  Bring </p><p>in other donors and recipients, he argued, just do not </p><p>let Africa be "pushed back" on the agenda; the </p><p>experts-to-experts relationship needs to be nourished </p><p>and sustained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) "The present global situation is not conducive </p><p>to Africa\'s interests," Aluko-Olokun opined.  Too much </p><p>attention was being devoted to Afghanistan, Iraq and </p><p>the Middle East.  "Our leaders want to be center </p><p>stage."  He offered, however, that NePAD "concretely </p><p>had not delivered much" in terms of progress toward </p><p>poverty alleviation, development of democracy and </p><p>economic growth.  He did not defend NePAD\'s </p><p>performance but contended that, since sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa seems less likely than any other region to </p><p>reach Millenium Development Goals, the region needed </p><p>special assistance.  NePAD, in turn, was urging all </p><p>African countries to submit occasional reports on </p><p>progress toward MDG benchmarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) Aluko-Olokun said Africa had questions about </p><p>the G-8 plan to limit discussion at Evian to growth </p><p>and international cooperation.  There needed also to </p><p>be an exchange on peace and security; one on terrorism </p><p>would also be useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Aluko-Olokun said African states were still </p><p>waiting for individual G-8 countries to provide </p><p>detailed information on which of the 110 points of the </p><p>Kananaskis Action Plan fit best with respective </p><p>capabilities and national interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Everyone is trying to get ready for Cancun, </p><p>Aluko-Olokun observed, but talks in Geneva appeared </p><p>deadlocked.  The NePAD countries wanted the G-8 to </p><p>"break the gridlock" and address issues of market </p><p>access. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) "The debt issue remains very sticky," Aluko- </p><p>Olokun commented.  There is not enough G-8 money to </p><p>fund debt relief for all HIPC-compliant countries. </p><p>Moreover, middle-income developing countries (such as </p><p>Nigeria) "cannot service their debts fiscally," Aluko- </p><p>Olokun averred.  "We want France to broach that topic </p><p>with the G-8 at Evian," he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Aluko-Olokun felt there needed to be ODA </p><p>reform.  The claims that there was "a lot of money" to </p><p>be had might be true in theory, but the "delivery </p><p>system [was] too difficult.  The European Development </p><p>Fund was particularly hard to access, he added, noting </p><p>that it would be good for Nigeria if more ODA went to </p><p>Niger, Chad and Benin; progress in those countries </p><p>would ease strains on Nigeria, he said. </p><p>10.  (C) During the discussion period, the EU HOM </p><p>offered that the EU was "open to budgetary support" </p><p>for Nigeria.  DCM asked him a day later exactly what </p><p>he meant, noting that the USG was a ways from such a </p><p>step.  HOM responded that nothing was in the offing </p><p>and that the EU was trying to encourage Nigeria along </p><p>the road to reform. </p><p>11.  (SBU) The NePAD Summit will take place on the </p><p>margins of Nigeria\'s Presidential inaugural events. </p><p>It is slated for May 29, 2003, from 1400 to 1800, in </p><p>Abuja. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
