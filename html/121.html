<p>S E C R E T MOGADISHU 04325 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SO, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOMALI WARNING TO LIBYANS ON TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE REPORTED EARLIER THAT THE SOMALIS HAD INFORMED </p><p>US THAT THEY HAD WARNED THE HEAD OF THE LIBYAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S BUREAU AGAINST UNDERTAKING ANY ACTION AGAINST </p><p>AMERICANS IN SOMALIA.  I HAVE JUST HAD ADDITIONAL </p><p>CONFIRMATION OF THIS FROM EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR MEKKY </p><p>(PROTECT SOURCE), WHO SAYS THAT MFA MINISTER OF STATE </p><p>HAMOUD TOLD HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE HAMOUD\'S CURRENT TRIP </p><p>TO THE NEW DELHI NAM MEETING THAT HE, HAMOUD, HAD </p><p>CALLED IN THE HEAD OF THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  HAMOUD TOLD MEKKY THAT HE HAD TOLD THE LIBYAN </p><p>THAT THE SOMALIS DID NOT LIKE THE CHARGES BEING </p><p>EXCHANGED BETWEEN TRIPOLI AND WASHINGTON.  THE LIBYANS </p><p>SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE SOMALI </p><p>GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME TO AGREE TO RESUME RELATIONS </p><p>WITH LIBYA.  IN THIS CONNECTION, HAMOUD SAID HE WANTED </p><p>TO WARN THE LIBYANS AGAINST ANY ACTION AGAINST </p><p>AMERICANS OR AMERICAN PROPERTY.  IN REPLY, THE LIBYAN </p><p>ASSURED HAMOUD THAT NO SUCH ACTION WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN </p><p>AS LONG AS HE REMAINED HEAD OF THE PEOPLE\'S BUREAU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  I THANKED AMBASSADOR MEKKY FOR THIS INFORMATION, </p><p>WHICH I SAID CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT THE SOMALIS HAD </p><p>TOLD US.  I ADDED THAT (A) LIBYAN PROMISES WERE OF </p><p>COURSE WORTH NOTHING, AND (B) ANY ACTION AGAINST US </p><p>HERE WOULD PRESUMABLY NOT BE TAKEN BY THE LIBYANS </p><p>IN PERSON, AS THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD IN FACT JUST </p><p>WARNED ME (MOGADISHU 4319). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
