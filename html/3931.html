MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 10-10-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, MOPS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Amid some positive news, violence in east </p><p>leaves at least seven suspected Tiger supporters dead </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 100403Z OCT 02 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 091457Z OCT 02 </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 091245Z OCT 02 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1891, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Police shot and killed at least seven </p><p>suspected Tamil Tiger supporters on October 9.  The </p><p>incident was triggered by an attempt to storm a police </p><p>station in the east.  On a positive note for the peace </p><p>process, the Tigers released six soldiers after </p><p>obtaining the release of two of their cadre.  In </p><p>addition, responding to the successful intervention of </p><p>GSL Minister Moragoda, over 200 prisoners suspected of </p><p>ties with the Tigers have halted a hunger strike.  Given </p><p>the mix of good news with the bad, the peace process </p><p>seems to have lurched into a particularly volatile </p><p>period.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Bloody Incident in the East </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Special Task Force (STF) police and Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) supporters engaged in a </p><p>bloody firefight on October 9.  The incident took place </p><p>near Akkaraipattu, a coastal town in the eastern </p><p>district of Ampara.  While reports are sketchy, the </p><p>incident apparently was touched off by an argument </p><p>between STF police and LTTE operatives backed up Tamil </p><p>civilians.  The operatives reported the incident to an </p><p>adjacent LTTE base, and a group of suspected LTTE cadre, </p><p>apparently joined by Tamil supporters, decided to storm </p><p>a nearby STF camp.  It is not clear who took the first </p><p>shot, but the STF, firing heavily, repelled the attack, </p><p>with its forces sustaining several injuries during the </p><p>incident. (Note:  The STF is a highly trained police </p><p>unit deployed throughout Ampara.  Three-thousand strong </p><p>in Ampara, the STF has had considerable success </p><p>countering the LTTE, largely due to its small unit </p><p>tactics.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The incident has prompted considerable concern </p><p>about its potential ramifications for the peace process. </p><p>Indeed, based on reports Mission is receiving today, the </p><p>east is quite tense over the incident, although no </p><p>violence has been reported as of yet.  Milinda Moragoda, </p><p>an important GSL minister involved in peace-related </p><p>issues, told us that he was very worried about what the </p><p>LTTE might do in response.  (Note:  For its part, the </p><p>LTTE has not yet apparently announced what it plans to </p><p>do, if anything.)  Nimal Goonetilleke, the head of the </p><p>STF, was rushing to Ampara today to check on the </p><p>situation.  Moragoda added that the Norwegian-run Sri </p><p>Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was also planning to </p><p>investigate the incident. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) (((Note:  Even before this latest incident, the </p><p>east has been the epicenter of much instability.  There </p><p>has been a recent spike in anger among Muslims in the </p><p>area, for example, over what they perceive to be their </p><p>marginalization in the peace process.  The situation </p><p>seems to be growing worse:  there are reports that a </p><p>number of Muslim MPs are now threatening to boycott </p><p>Parliament if their concerns about the peace process are </p><p>not met.  Moragoda told us that the GSL was trying to </p><p>head off this protest.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>LTTE Releases Soldiers </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On a positive note for the peace process, a two </p><p>week-old standoff between the GSL and the LTTE in </p><p>Trincomalee has ended.  As foreshadowed in Ref D, the </p><p>LTTE released six Sri Lankan soldiers from detention </p><p>late October 9.  The LTTE took this action after the </p><p>government met the group? demand and released two LTTE </p><p>cadre from its custody earlier in the day.  During a </p><p>meeting with visiting DRL P/DAS Parmly on October 10, </p><p>K.C. Kamalasabayson, the Attorney General, expressed </p><p>relief that the situation had been resolved, noting that </p><p>the standoff had proved destabilizing in Trincomalee. </p><p>(Note:  Many Sinhalese and some Muslims in the area had </p><p>taken to the streets in various demonstrations </p><p>protesting the LTTE\'s detention of the soldiers.) </p><p>Kamalasabayson said he had urged the judge involved in </p><p>the LTTE cadre? case to grant bail and release them in </p><p>order to cool the situation down. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Hunger Strike Lifted </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In another positive development, Tamils </p><p>detained in various prisons lifted their hunger strike </p><p>on October 9.  The approximately 200 detainees, who had </p><p>begun their action on October 1, were demanding their </p><p>immediate release from jails in Kalutara (south of </p><p>Colombo), Batticaloa in the east, and elsewhere.  The </p><p>prisoners asserted that the law they were being held </p><p>under, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), was unfair </p><p>and should be repealed.  The strike ended after a visit </p><p>to Kalutara prison, where most of the detainees are </p><p>housed, by Minister Moragoda late on October 9. </p><p>Moragoda pledged to the detainees that the government </p><p>would carefully look at their cases in the next 30 days </p><p>in an effort to see whom it could release.  Attorney </p><p>General Kamalasabayson confirmed to P/DAS Parmly that </p><p>his office would actively review the detainees?cases. </p><p>He thought that most of the detainees probably merited </p><p>release.  About 50, however, were hard-core LTTE cadre </p><p>who had been engaged in terrorist attacks, who could not </p><p>be released. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  Apparently in reaction to the </p><p>complaints of the detainees and the LTTE about the act, </p><p>Kamalasabayson noted that the government was actively </p><p>considering revoking the PTA.  Confirming the Attorney </p><p>General\'s comments, Mission has learned that the weekly </p><p>cabinet meeting on October 9 actively considered the </p><p>issue of doing away with the PTA, which has been in </p><p>place for almost 25 years now.  The cabinet agreed to </p><p>review the issue further.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Given the mix of good news with the bad, the </p><p>peace process seems to have lurched into a particularly </p><p>volatile period.  Due to the Ampara incident, the </p><p>situation in the east seems to be even more tense than </p><p>usual.  It is still not clear what the LTTE reaction </p><p>will be, but the group rarely backs down when it feels </p><p>it is under pressure.  On the other hand, the GSL gave </p><p>the LTTE what it wanted with respect to the de facto </p><p>prisoner exchange in Trincomalee and by agreeing to </p><p>reconsider the utility of the PTA.   Whether this will </p><p>be enough to assuage the LTTE is unknown. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) (Note:  Regarding the LTTE\'s possible reaction </p><p>to the Ampara incident, Moragoda told us that senior </p><p>Tiger negotiator Anton Balasingham was supposed to </p><p>transit Colombo today in order to visit the LTTE </p><p>leadership in the north.  The trip was postponed at the </p><p>last moment, however, and he wondered whether </p><p>Balasingham was angry over what took place in Ampara. </p><p>When asked, the Norwegian Embassy told us that it </p><p>thought that "practical reasons" had prevented </p><p>Balasingham\'s visit, but it was still checking.  End </p><p>Note.)  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
