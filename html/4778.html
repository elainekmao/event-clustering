<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: ICRC ACTIVE IN KAREN STATE BUT STILL SEEKING ACCESS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: On a recent visit to Karen State, Poloff was </p><p>told by an International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) </p><p>representative that the agency is making progress on </p><p>establishing a meaningful presence in the area.  While </p><p>progress has been slow, the ICRC has had some success in </p><p>providing clean water to residents, assisting mine victims, </p><p>and delivering messages to families of prisoners.  The agency </p><p>has also helped improve conditions in labor camps.  The ICRC </p><p>has not yet succeeded in establishing contacts with military </p><p>commanders -- a step ICRC feels is essential for </p><p>investigations of alleged human rights abuses in the area. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In late November, Poloff met with the head of the </p><p>ICRC office in Karen State, Ms. Amela Husagic.  Ms. Husagic </p><p>and two other ICRC international staff provide coverage of </p><p>Karen State from their offices in the state capital, Hpa\'an. </p><p>Husagic said the ICRC has four priorities in the area: 1) </p><p>water sanitation for hospitals, schools, and homes; 2) </p><p>orthopedic care for mine victims; 3) delivering messages to </p><p>families of prisoners; and 4) protection activities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  While the ICRC has had a presence in Hpa\'an since </p><p>2000, Husagic said it has been a slow process to gain access </p><p>to local officials and build confidence with them.  The ICRC </p><p>has remained patient, however, has developed good relations </p><p>with key authorities, and is starting to implement programs. </p><p>For example, the ICRC has provided clean water supplies (tube </p><p>wells) for two township hospitals, supplies to build simple </p><p>toilets in some homes and schools, and training to improve </p><p>sanitation.  In addition, in January the office will open an </p><p>orthopedic care facility in Hpa\'an to provide prosthetics and </p><p>therapy for mining victims.  While the ICRC has assisted in </p><p>providing orthopedic care through government clinics in other </p><p>areas of Burma, this is the first independent ICRC orthopedic </p><p>care clinic. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In providing communications between prisoners and </p><p>their families, Husagic said she and her colleagues have been </p><p>allowed to travel throughout most of Karen State to deliver </p><p>messages to family members.  Identifying and working through </p><p>the process for obtaining government permission to travel has </p><p>been slow, she noted, but now the ICRC has standing </p><p>permission to travel between Hpa\'an and Kawkareik, and other </p><p>specific travel requests are generally processed quickly. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Husagic said her office does not conduct prison </p><p>visits because the only prison in Karen State, on the </p><p>outskirts of Hpa\'an, is under construction and not scheduled </p><p>to open until January 2003.  Her team has requested access to </p><p>two "New Life" and other prison labor camps the SPDC has </p><p>established in Karen State.  She explained that the New Life </p><p>camps are a type of labor camp located in previously </p><p>undeveloped border areas the government wants to populate. </p><p>The prisoners at the New Life camps are required to clear the </p><p>jungle, plant agricultural products, and build villages.  The </p><p>prisoners\' families are encouraged to live near the camps and </p><p>are given some land and other incentives to encourage them to </p><p>stay in the area when the prisoners complete their sentences. </p><p> (Note: The ICRC Head of Delegation in Rangoon told Poloff </p><p>recently that although the New Life idea sounds reasonable, </p><p>the camps have not been successful because of difficult </p><p>living conditions and isolation. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Husagic said she has been allowed to visit one of the </p><p>New Life camps and some of the other labor camps in Karen </p><p>State.  While not wanting to provide specific details due to </p><p>ICRC\'s confidentiality rules, she said life in the camps is </p><p>generally quite hard but that ICRC\'s presence has led to some </p><p>improvements. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  When Poloff queried whether ICRC had attempted to </p><p>follow-up on allegations of SPDC abuses in Karen State, </p><p>Husagic responded that she has not yet been able to establish </p><p>communications and working relations with the responsible </p><p>officials, i.e. the Burmese military, necessary for this </p><p>activity.  She said that although she had built up good </p><p>contacts with many local township and Military Intelligence </p><p>officials, she did not have access to Burma Army field </p><p>commanders.  She also noted that the lines of authority </p><p>between various military authorities in the field are not </p><p>clear and appear to vary depending on location.  The Nasaka </p><p>(a combined force of MI, Customs, Immigration, and the Police </p><p>Force) appeared to be in charge in certain areas while MI or </p><p>the Army appeared to have the upper hand in other areas. </p><p>This was complicated by the fact that some authorities </p><p>apparently report to the Regional Commander while others </p><p>reported directly to various elements in Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Husagic is working to establish the relations </p><p>necessary to extend protection activities in the area.  She </p><p>said she continues to hear credible reports of continuing </p><p>abuses in Karen State and the ICRC will continue to press for </p><p>access in order to mitigate these abuses.  She noted, </p><p>however, that this is the most sensitive aspect of the ICRC\'s </p><p>activities and it will take time to develop. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
