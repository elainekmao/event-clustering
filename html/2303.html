<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 007811 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 198912 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM SCOTT MARCIEL FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) FIGHTING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS </p><p>LONG BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY (GOT). </p><p>SINCE THE MID-1960S, TURKEY HAS FACED ALMOST A CONSTANT </p><p>THREAT FROM DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM TARGETED </p><p>AGAINST BOTH TURKS AND FOREIGNERS, INCLUDING USG PERSONNEL. </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN TURKEY INCLUDE </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST, RADICAL ISLAMIST, SEPARATIST, AND </p><p>PRO-CHECHEN. MOST OF THESE GROUPS OPERATE TRANSNATIONALLY AS </p><p>WELL. IN LIGHT OF THIS THREAT, THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED BOTH THE WILL AND CAPABILITY TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE USG\'S INTERNATIONAL, </p><p>COORDINATED EFFORT. TURKEY\'S HARD-LINE AGAINST TERRORISM WAS </p><p>SUPREMELY MANIFESTED IN ITS EARLY AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>US-LED COALITION IN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), BOTH </p><p>THROUGH PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND CONCRETE ACTIONS. (PARAS. 13, </p><p>19, 20, 21, 22, 23) </p><p> </p><p>U.S. DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ON OCTOBER 8, 1997, THE SECRETARY OF STATE NAMED THE </p><p>SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK) AND THE </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S PARTY/FRONT (DHKP/C, </p><p>FORMERLY KNOWN AS REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (DEV-SOL), MAKING THEM </p><p>SUBJECT TO THE ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT </p><p>OF 1996.  ON OCTOBER 11, 2001 THE SECRETARY OF STATE RENEWED </p><p>THOSE DESIGNATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE MAIN RADICAL-LEFT TERROR ORGANIZATION, DHKP-C, </p><p>CONDUCTS SMALL-SCALE OPERATIONS AGAINST TURKS AND FOREIGNERS </p><p>ALIKE (ARMED ATTACKS ON UNIFORMED POLICE, SUICIDE AND OTHER </p><p>BOMBINGS, ASSASSINATIONS). TWO DHKP/C SUICIDE BOMBERS IN </p><p>JANUARY AND SEPTEMBER KILLED 3 POLICEMAN AND AN AUSTRALIAN </p><p>TOURIST AND WOUNDED SCORES OF BYSTANDERS. A SEPTEMBER 28 </p><p>PIPEBOMB ATTACK ON A MCDONALD\'S IN ISTANBUL APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN CARRIED OUT BY RADICAL LEFTISTS, THOUGH NO GROUP HAS </p><p>CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACT. OTHER FAR-LEFT TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS STILL ACTIVE INCLUDE THE TURKISH COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY/MARXIST-LENINIST (TKP/ML)  AND THE TURKISH WORKERS\' AND </p><p>PEASANTS LIBERATION ARMY (TIKKO). OF THE TWO ONLY TIKKO STILL </p><p>CARRIES OUT OPERATIONS WITH ANY LEVEL OF FREQUENCY, AND THEN </p><p>USUALLY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN ANATOLIA. </p><p> </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIST </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  IN TERMS OF CAPABILITIES AND FOLLOWERS, THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST "TURKISH HIZBULLAH" POSES THE GREATEST THREAT </p><p>OF ALL RADICAL ISLAMIST GROUPS IN TURKEY. IT STAGED A </p><p>SPECTACULAR JANUARY 2001 AMBUSH IN DIYARBAKIR THAT TOOK THE </p><p>LIFE OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR OKKAN AND FIVE OF </p><p>HIS BODYGUARDS. TWO UNDERCOVER POLICE WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER </p><p>HIZBULLAH ATTACK IN OCTOBER 2001. HIZBULLAH HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>SHUNNED CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES IN FAVOR OF BATTLING </p><p>RIVALS, LARGELY THE PKK AND ANOTHER RIVAL ISLAMIST FACTION. </p><p>BEFORE THE OKKAN ASSASSINATION, MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVED THE </p><p>GROUP HAD BEEN RENDERED INCAPABLE OF STAGING A SERIOUS </p><p>TERRORIST ASSAULT AFTER POLICE RAIDED AN ISTANBUL SAFEHOUSE </p><p>IN JANUARY 2000, KILLING THE RIGIDLY CENTRALIZED GROUP\'S </p><p>LEADER AND SEIZING PILES OF DOCUMENTS THAT LED TO THOUSANDS </p><p>OF DETENTIONS. OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS INCLUDE THE GREAT </p><p>EASTERN RAIDER\'S FRONT (IBDA-C), FEDERAL ISLAMIC STATE OF </p><p>ANATOLIA (KAPLANCILAR), SELAM GROUP, ISLAMIC MOVEMENT </p><p>ORGANIZATION (IHO), AND THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS. </p><p> </p><p>SEPARATIST </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THE PKK REPRESENTS THE LARGEST SEPARATIST TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP IN TURKEY, THOUGH ITS CAPABILITY TO OPERATE HAS BEEN </p><p>DRASTICALLY REDUCED THANKS TO VIGOROUS AND ON-GOING </p><p>COUNTER-INSURGENCY EFFORTS OF THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES, </p><p>JANDARMA, TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP), AND VILLAGE GUARDS </p><p>(A PARAMILITARY GUARD FORCE RECRUITED FROM LOCAL VILLAGERS). </p><p>THIS EFFORT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF </p><p>THE PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN IN 1999. WITH ITS LEADER </p><p>INCARCERATED IN IMRALI PRISON NEAR ISTANBUL, THE PKK NOW </p><p>LARGELY ABIDES BY A SEPTEMBER 1, 1999 SELF-PROCLAIMED </p><p>CEASEFIRE. SMALL PKK COMBAT FORMATIONS, ESTIMATED BY THE </p><p>TURKISH MILITARY AT BETWEEN 300-500, STILL OPERATE, THOUGH </p><p>LARGELY IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND AT A DRASTICALLY REDUCED LEVEL </p><p>FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE CONFLICT IN 1992-94. SMALL CELLS AND </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN THROUGHOUT TURKEY, BUT THESE HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUPPRESSED TO THE POINT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>RATHER THAN THE MILITARY, OVERSEE MOST OPERATIONS AND </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS. FOUR PROVINCES (DOWN FROM A HIGH OF ELEVEN) </p><p>STILL REMAIN UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECREE, WHICH IS </p><p>RENEWED BY PARLIAMENT EVERY FOUR MONTHS AND WAS LAST EXTENDED </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 2001. INCREASED CALM AND SECURITY IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST SINCE 1999 HAS ENABLED, ACCORDING TO STATE </p><p>AUTHORITIES, 18,000 INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS TO RETURN TO </p><p>THEIR VILLAGES. </p><p> </p><p>PRO-CHECHEN TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) A GROUP OF 13 PRO-CHECHEN TURKISH CITIZENS SEIZED THE </p><p>SWISS HOTEL IN ISTANBUL ON APRIL 22, 2001 AND HELD 150 </p><p>HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 37 AMERICAN CITIZENS, FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>12 HOURS UNTIL THEY SURRENDERED WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE TERROR </p><p>GROUP STAGED THE RAID TO PROTEST RUSSIAN ACTIONS IN CHECHNYA. </p><p>THEY ARE PRESENTLY IN CUSTODY AND ON TRIAL IN ISTANBUL STATE </p><p>SECURITY COURT UNDER A VARIETY OF CHARGES, THOUGH NOT UNDER </p><p>TURKEY\'S TOUGH ANTI-TERROR LAW. THE LEADER OF THE HOSTAGE </p><p>TAKERS, MUHAMMED TOKCAN, MASTERMINDED THE 1996 SEIZURE OF THE </p><p>FERRY BOAT AVRASYA. HE ESCAPED FROM PRISON AFTER BEING </p><p>CONVICTED FOR THE INCIDENT, THOUGH AGAIN NOT UNDER THE </p><p>ANTI-TERROR LAW. LARGE NUMBERS OF TURKS, MANY WITH ROOTS IN </p><p>THE CAUCASUS, ARE SYMPATHETIC TO CHECHEN AMBITIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE CAPITALIZED TITLES BELOW CORRESPOND TO REFTEL </p><p>QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM (C) </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) STATE SECURITY COURTS (DGM) IN EIGHT PROVINCES, WITH </p><p>JURISDICTION FOR ALL CRIMES THAT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF </p><p>THE ANTI-TERROR LAW, TAKE A VIGOROUS APPROACH TOWARDS </p><p>PROSECUTING TERROR-RELATED CRIMES. APPROXIMATELY 2,400 TERROR </p><p>CASES CAME BEFORE STATE SECURITY COURTS IN 2001. AGGRESSIVE </p><p>PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED HIZBULLAH MEMBERS CONTINUES, WITH </p><p>MULTIPLE ON-GOING INVESTIGATIONS AND TRIALS. AVERAGE TRIAL </p><p>TIMES RUN MORE THAN A YEAR, AND DEFENDANTS ARE USUALLY </p><p>INCARCERATED DURING THEIR TRIALS. APPROXIMATELY 2000 </p><p>HIZBULLAH MEMBERS ARE PRESENTLY DETAINED OR IN PRISON. THERE </p><p>ARE APPROXIMATELY 8,600 INDIVIDUALS PRESENTLY SERVING </p><p>SENTENCES FOR TERROR CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) OPENED IN JULY 2000 IN DIYARBAKIR STATE SECURITY </p><p>COURT, THE MAIN HIZBULLAH TRIAL CONTINUES. TWENTY </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING TWO TOP HIZBULLAH LEADERS, ARE CHARGED </p><p>WITH 156 MURDERS. THE TRIAL OF 17 JERUSALEM WARRIORS </p><p>SUSPECTS, CHARGED WITH 22 MURDERS OF PROMINENT SECULAR </p><p>INTELLECTUALS AND JOURNALISTS, FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, AND USAF </p><p>SSGT VICTOR MARVIK, IS ALSO ON-GOING. ABDULLAH OCALAN, THE </p><p>LEADER OF THE PKK CONVICTED OF TREASON IN JUNE 1999 AND </p><p>SENTENCED TO DEATH, APPEALED TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS (ECHR). IN JANUARY 2000, PRIME MINISTER BULENT ECEVIT </p><p>DECIDED NOT TO SUBMIT OCALAN\'S DEATH SENTENCE TO THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL, PENDING A FINAL ECHR DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (D/E) </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN 2001, THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY DID NOT SEEK THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON </p><p>TERROR-RELATED CHARGES, NOR DID THE UNITED STATES SEEK THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUCH SUSPECTS FROM TURKEY. IN THE PAST, TURKEY </p><p>HAS FACED DIFFICULTY IN EXTRADITING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES. SYRIA, IRAQ, AND IRAN HAVE LONG HARBORED PKK </p><p>TERRORISTS WHICH THEY HAVE USED AGAINST TURKEY. EUROPEAN </p><p>STATES HAVE ALSO BEEN HESITANT TO EXTRADITE TERROR-SUSPECTS </p><p>TO TURKEY. DESPITE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION </p><p>ON TERRORISM, SYMPATHY WITH KURDISH POLITICAL AND CULTURAL </p><p>ASPIRATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN STATES, ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE </p><p>BY TURKISH OFFICIALS, AND TURKEY\'S LEGAL PROVISION FOR THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY HAVE ALL PROVED IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCH </p><p>EXTRADITIONS. HOWEVER, NO EXECUTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN </p><p>TURKEY SINCE 1984 DESPITE THE FACT THAT SCORES OF CONVICTED </p><p>TERRORISTS, INCLUDING PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN, HAVE </p><p>RECEIVED DEATH SENTENCES. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) MOST RECENTLY, BELGIUM HAS REFUSED TO EXTRADITE FERYA </p><p>ERDAL, A MEMBER OF DHKP/C ACCUSED IN THE JANUARY 1996 SLAYING </p><p>OF PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN OZDEMIR SABANCI AND TWO OTHER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS. THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT CITED TURKEY\'S LEGAL </p><p>PROVISION FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AS GROUNDS FOR REFUSING </p><p>EXTRADITION, EVEN THOUGH TURKEY PROMISED NOT TO EXECUTE HER </p><p>IF SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY. ERDAL WAS PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST </p><p>IN BELGIUM AND INITIALLY CHARGED WITH MINOR WEAPONS </p><p>VIOLATIONS. IN 2001, HOWEVER, CITING THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION </p><p>ON TERRORISM, A BRUSSELS COURT RULED THAT ERDAL COULD BE </p><p>TRIED FOR MURDER UNDER BELGIAN LAW. THE TURKISH MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE WELCOMED THE RULING AS A "POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT." </p><p>ERDAL\'S LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION (F) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  PRESIDENT SEZER, PRME MINISTER ECEVIT, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER CEM, AND CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF HUSEYIN </p><p>KIVRIKOGLU HAVE REPEATEDLY AND STRONGLY DENOUNCED TERRORISM </p><p>DURING 2001. THESE STATEMENTS ONLY INCREASED IN VOLUME AND </p><p>IMPORTANCE IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 12, PRIME MINISTER ECEVIT, ON LIVE TELEVISION, </p><p>STATED FIRMLY THAT TURKEY "WAS AT THE SIDE OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES". </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) AFTER THE APRIL 22 SEIZURE OF THE SWISS HOTEL, WHERE </p><p>PRO-CHECHEN TURKISH MILITANTS HELD 150 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 37 </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS, FOR 12 HOURS, THEN INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>TANTAN AND THE ISTANBUL SECURITY DIRECTOR MADE STATEMENTS </p><p>THAT IMPLIED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT AN ACT OF TERROR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS BY THE GOT (G) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U)  ON ALL FRONTS, THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY CONTINUED </p><p>AGGRESSIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2001. THE POLICE </p><p>CONTINUED THEIR RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF HIZBULLAH AFTER THE </p><p>JANUARY ASSASSINATION OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR </p><p>OKKAN, CONDUCTING OVER 553 OPERATIONS THAT LED TO 1313 </p><p>DETENTIONS THROUGH NOVEMBER. SULHADIN URUK, A LEADING </p><p>HIZBULLAH MILITANT, WAS KILLED IN A SEPTEMBER RAID. A </p><p>DECEMBER OPERATION NETTED SUSPECTS IMPLICATED IN THE 1993 </p><p>SLAYING OF DEMOCRACY PARTY DEPUTY MEHMET SINCAR, THE </p><p>KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF ISLAMIST FEMINIST KONCA KURIS, AND </p><p>THE OCTOBER 2001 ASSASSINATION OF TWO POLICE OFFICERS.  THE </p><p>GOT CONTINUES ITS ACTIVE SUPPRESSION OF THE PKK, THOUGH ITS </p><p>SECURITY OPERATIONS TEMPO HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN </p><p>LINE WITH A REDUCTION IN THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) POLICE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY WORKED TO DISRUPT AND </p><p>UNCOVER DHKP/C CELLS. IN ADDITION, THE DECEMBER 2000 </p><p>"OPERATION RETURN TO LIFE" HAS REPORTEDLY GREATLY REDUCED THE </p><p>GROUP\'S OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.  THAT OPERATION SMASHED </p><p>DHKP-C CONTROL IN LARGE, WARD-STYLE DETENTION FACILITIES AND </p><p>TRANSFERRED ITS MEMBERS TO SMALL-CELL, "F-TYPE" PRISONS. </p><p>DHKP-C HAD PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED OPERATIONS AND TRAINING FROM </p><p>PRISONS WHERE AUTHORITIES HAD EFFECTIVELY LOST CONTROL. IN </p><p>PROTEST OF THE "F-TYPE" PRISONS, DHKP/C SYMPATHIZERS AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS HAVE CONDUCTED HUNGER STRIKES IN WHICH 41 </p><p>INDIVIDUALS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES.  A STATE FORENSIC AUTOPSY </p><p>REPORT RELEASED AFTER THE RAID INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE 31 </p><p>DEATHS IN THE OPERATION MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE  USE OF </p><p>EXCESSIVE FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM (H) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) THE GOT CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY OPPOSES BOTH </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. TURKEY DOES NOT VIEW </p><p>ITS MAINTENANCE OF DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA AS </p><p>CONSTITUTING SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>SUPPORT STATEMENTS FOR TERRORIST COUNTRIES (I) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) THE GOT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 2000 IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM (J) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 HARDENED GOT DETERMINATION </p><p>TO FIGHT TERRORISM, BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC. THIS </p><p>HEIGHTENED WILL WAS MANIFESTED IN BOTH CONTINUING EFFORTS TO </p><p>SUPPRESS DOMESTIC TERROR GROUPS, ESPECIALLY HIZBULLAH, AND IN </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT--BOTH IN WORD AND DEED--OF OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>FREEDOM. IN THE WAKE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBINGS, THE </p><p>GOT HAS STEPPED UP PRESSURE FOR THE EU TO ADOPT TOUGHER </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST TURKISH TERROR GROUPS OPERATING IN EUROPE, </p><p>NAMELY DHKP/C, PKK, HIZBULLAH, AND THE KAPLANCILAR. ON </p><p>DECEMBER 12, THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY OUTLAWED THE </p><p>KAPLANCILAR ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>USG COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVE WITH GOT (K) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p></p><p>20. (U) TURKISH SUPPORT IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE GOT\'S COMMITTED POLICY ON FIGHTING TERROR, </p><p>BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. IN THE FACE OF STRONG PUBLIC </p><p>OPPOSITION, PARLIAMENT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PM ECEVIT, </p><p>PASSED A RESOLUTION ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO SEND TURKISH </p><p>TROOPS ABROAD AND TO PERMIT THE STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS </p><p>ON TURKISH SOIL TO SUPPORT OEF. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION, TURKEY OFFERED A 90-MAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT </p><p>FOR DUTY IN AFGHANISTAN.  IN GENERAL, BUT ESPECIALLY AFTER </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, THE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) HAS CONTINUED </p><p>TO PROVIDED EXCELLENT PROTECTION OF US DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>MILITARY FACILITIES THROUGHOUT TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) IN RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT\'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ASKING </p><p>FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE TERRORIST-RELATED FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSETS, THE GOT FORMED AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO </p><p>COORDINATE INVESTIGATIONS AND TO FREEZE FINANCIAL ASSETS. </p><p>THIS EFFORT HAS RESULTED SO FAR IN FREEZING ABOUT USD 2 </p><p>MILLION IN FINANCIAL ASSETS IN TURKEY OWNED BY AN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER (NO. 13224) LIST OF TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCIERS. THE GOT IS REVIEWING THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDING </p><p>THE LEGAL PROCESS FOR FREEZING FINANCIAL ASSETS IN ORDER TO </p><p>FACILITATE QUICK REACTION TO NEW INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) </p><p> </p><p>22. (S)  THE TURKISH MILITARY  HAS ALSO OFFERED THE USE OF AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL AIRBASE TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON INCIRLIK AFB AND </p><p>EASED FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS TO EASE US SUPPORT OF FORCES </p><p>OPERATING IN AFGHANISTAN. OTHER TURKISH ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>OEF INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--OFFERED TWO KC-135 REFUELING TANKERS; </p><p>--CSAR IN TU/ONV INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT AND MEDICAL SUPPORT </p><p>PLANNING; </p><p>--AGREE TO STRIP ESM UNITS FROM NEW HELICOPTERS FOR USE BY US </p><p>FORCES; </p><p>--BLANKET OVERFLIGHT AND LANDING FOR ALL AMC A/C (CLEARANCE </p><p>INCLUDES A/C AND HAZMAT AT ZERO LEAD TIME AND MINIMUM </p><p>NOTIFICATION WHERE ESSENTIAL); </p><p>--USE OF AIRBASES TO INCLUDE: FUEL, LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND </p><p>SUPPLY, STATIONING AIRCRAFT CREW AND NECESSARY EQUIPMENT; </p><p>--4 LNOS AT CENTCOM, 1 AT EUCOM, 1 IN AFGHANISTAN; </p><p>--FULLY COMPLIANT: WASSENAAR, AUSTRALIA GROUPS, MISSILE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL, NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP, </p><p>NONPROLIFERATION REGIMES; </p><p>--AUTHORIZED THE DELIVERY OF LETHAL MUNITIONS (ALONG WITH </p><p>FOOD AND BLANKETS) TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE OUT OF INCIRLIK </p><p>AFB. </p><p> </p><p>23. (S) IN GENERAL, TURKEY HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE IN </p><p>WATCHLISTING, ARRESTING, DETAINING, QUESTIONING, AND </p><p>DISRUPTING SOME SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. THE GOT HAS ALSO PROVED HELPFUL IN TRACING AND </p><p>TRACKING INDIVIDUALS BELIEVED TO HAVE LINKS TO THE AL-QA\'IDA </p><p>ORGANIZATION. BESIDES ASSISTING WITH SUSPECTED TERRORISTS </p><p>LOCATED IN TURKEY, ANKARA HAS ALSO BEEN COOPERATIVE IN </p><p>ASSISTING THE USG IN ITS REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN MAKING </p><p>SMOOTH THE TRANSITING OF TERRORISTS THROUGH TURKEY FOR </p><p>RENDITION TO OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION-INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION (L) </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) THE MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND TURKEY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JANUARY 1981, </p><p>GOVERNS INVESTIGATIVE COOPERATION. THE GOT HAS EXPEDITIOUSLY </p><p>PROCESSED REQUESTS FOR INVESTIGATIVE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE UNDER </p><p>THIS TREATY. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES THE GOT HAS LEFT REQUESTS </p><p>UNANSWERED FOR OVER THREE YEARS. IN 2001, THE US DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF JUSTICE SUCCESSFULLY FORWARDED AN MLAT REQUEST TO </p><p>INTERVIEW A SUSPECTED MEMBER OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, AN </p><p>ISLAMIST TERROR GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) OVERALL, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE GOT HAS WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN THE APPREHENSION, CONVICTION, AND </p><p>PUNISHMENT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS IN </p><p>TURKEY. THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF THE GOT\'S AGGRESSIVE </p><p>EFFORTS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE CONTINUES TO BE THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2000 ARREST OF FOUR SUSPECTS INDICTED IN THE 1991 </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF USAF SSGT VICTOR MARVICK IN ANKARA. THE </p><p>TRIAL OF THE FOUR , WHO ARE ALLEGEDLY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JERUSALEM WARRIORS, IS CONTINUING. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION-PREVENTION (M) </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) PURSUANT TO AN MLAT REQUEST, IN SEPTEMBER 2001 RSO </p><p>AND LEGAT INTERVIEWED RUSTU AYTUFAN, AN ALLEGED MEMBER OF THE </p><p>JERUSALEM WARRIORS, REGARDING HIS  CONFESSION TO THE TNP THAT </p><p>HE AND ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL CONDUCTED PRE-OPERATIONAL </p><p>SURVEILLANCE OF US EMBASSY EMPLOYEES AND OF THE US EMBASSY </p><p>COMPOUND IN 1999. ON HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY\'S ADVICE, HOWEVER, </p><p>AYTUFAN REFUSED TO GRANT AN INTERVIEW FOR FEAR THAT HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS COULD BE USED AGAINST HIM IN A PENDING TRIAL FOR </p><p>SEVERAL POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED KILLINGS, INCLUDING THAT OF </p><p>SSGT MARVICK. EMBASSY ANKARA REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT ONGOING </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DOJ AND THE TURKISH MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE WILL YIELD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE </p><p>SUSPECT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
