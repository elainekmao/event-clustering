<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA (JGREENBLATT), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON LIBERIA, JULY 14, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Carlos Alberto Montaner in Tegucigalpa-based moderate </p><p>daily "El Heraldo" on 7/12 entitled "Yankee, come home!". "The </p><p>international public opinion wasn\'t prepared to witness the show </p><p>put by countless demonstrators asking for a US military </p><p>intervention in Liberia, to end the civil war that is tearing </p><p>this country apart. They didn\'t ask for troops from the U.N., </p><p>NATO, the Russians, the EU, much less from the Organization of </p><p>African Unity. They want the gringos. How come?, because of their </p><p>historical ties. Liberia was founded by a group of former </p><p>American slaves that returned to their African motherland. We </p><p>just have to find out if the U.S. has the will to take on this </p><p>endeavor, so little after the Iraqi campaign." </p><p> </p><p>"I certainly hope that the US leads an international force to </p><p>bring peace to Liberia and in general to that particularly </p><p>unstable African region. There\'s not much that can be done, and </p><p>it would be absurd to create false expectations, but still </p><p>there\'s a little hope: it appears that Liberia\'s neighbor </p><p>country, Senegal, is slowly consolidating a democratic </p><p>government. With a combination of luck, time and appropriate </p><p>advice, this can be a leading example for this region. The US </p><p>might just be the last hope for this poor people." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
