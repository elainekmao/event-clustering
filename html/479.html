<p>UNCLAS RABAT 010076 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, MO </p><p>SUBJECT:  1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:    STATE 346420 </p><p> </p><p>1.  POST RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS LISTED IN REFTEL PARA </p><p>5. </p><p> </p><p>A)  THERE WERE NO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THIS YEAR.  THE MOROCCAN JUDICIARY HAS </p><p>CHARGED 29 STUDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION "JUSTICE AND CHARITY" AT OUJDA UNIVERSITY WITH THE </p><p>KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF AT LEAST TWO STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>IN EARLY NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>B)  NO EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WERE CARRIED OUT OR </p><p>REQUESTED IN 1991. </p><p> </p><p>C)  THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p>MOROCCO DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S., BUT </p><p>WOULD LIKELY COOPERATE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH ANY REQUEST </p><p>FOR THE EXTRADITION OF A TERRORIST. </p><p> </p><p>D)  THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED A </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO SECURITY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY THOSE </p><p>INVOLVING POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>GULF WAR, THE GOM UNDERTOOK EXCEPTIONAL SECURITY MEASURES TO </p><p>PREEMPT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS IN MOROCCO, AND PROVIDED </p><p>ENHANCED SECURITY FOR U.S. FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL.  THE GOM, </p><p>HOWEVER, PREFERS TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES QUIETLY AND DOES NOT </p><p>GENERALLY ISSUE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON SECURITY MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>E)  THE GOM PARTICIPATES AS AN OBSERVER IN THE ANNUAL MINISTERIAL </p><p>CONFERENCE OF THE TREVI GROUP.  THE GOM ALSO PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1990 IN A REVIEW OF THE U.S.-MOROCCO BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON COUNTERTERRORISM, NARCOTICS AND ORGANIZED CRIME, </p><p>PART OF AN ONGOING BILATERAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES </p><p>ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>F)  THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, EITHER </p><p>RHETORICALLY OR MATERIALLY. </p><p> </p><p>G)  MOROCCO IS LINKED TO LIBYA BY BOTH COUNTRIES\' MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>THE ARAB MAGHREB UNION, AS WELL AS BY EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL TIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOM HAS SOUGHT THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, BUT </p><p>HAS NOT SUPPORTED LIBYA ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  MOROCCO STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTS THE PALESTINIANS\' CLAIM TO SELF-DETERMINATION, AND </p><p>CONSIDERS THE PLO TO BE THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  MOROCCO HAS LONG WORKED TO MODERATE THE PLO, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF THE </p><p>ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  THE GOM ENCOURAGES THE PLO TO LIVE UP TO </p><p>ITS COMMITMENT TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>H)  THE GOM DEMONSTRATED HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO TERRORIST </p><p>THREATS RESULTING FROM THE GULF WAR.  THIS HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY </p><p>HAS CONTINUED INTO THE POST-WAR PERIOD, RESULTING IN INCREASED </p><p>RESPONSIVENESS TO USG SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE GOM IS ALSO </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM, BOTH AS THE RESULT OF EXTREMIST OPPOSITION TO MIDDLE </p><p>EAST PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE RECENT STUDENT VIOLENCE BETWEEN </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST AND LEFTIST STUDENT FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USSERY </p><p></p></div>
