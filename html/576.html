<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 08839 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR HA, NEA/ARN </p><p>LONDON FOR JOHNSON </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, PINS, PTER, KISL, SY, LE, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIANS RELEASE 45 LEBANESE SUNNI ISLAMIC </p><p>-         FUNDAMENTALISTS AS PART OF DECEMBER 1 AMNESTY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAMASCUS 8757 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  THE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER "AL-NAHAR" REPORTED </p><p>DECEMBER 4 THAT 45 MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC UNIFICATION </p><p>MOVEMENT (HARIKAT AL-TAWHID AL-ISLAMI), WHO WERE </p><p>IMPRISONED IN SYRIA, WERE FREED AND RETURNED TO THEIR </p><p>HOMES IN TRIPOLI, LEBANON, AS PART OF THE AMNESTY </p><p>COVERING 554 POLITICAL DETAINEES WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED IN </p><p>DAMASCUS ON DECEMBER 1.  A TAWHID SPOKESMAN CLAIMED IN </p><p>THE SAME ARTICLE THAT THE SYRIANS ARE STILL DETAINING </p><p>120 MEMBERS OF TAWHID.  WE NOTICE FROM FBIS REPORTING </p><p>THAT RADIO TEHRAN REPORTED THE SAME NEWS ON DECEMBER 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE RELEASE OF THE LEBANESE TAWHID </p><p>MEMBERS ELABORATES ON THE ASSERTION IN THE LEBANESE </p><p>NEWSPAPER "L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR" THAT MANY OF THOSE FREED </p><p>UNDER THE DECEMBER 1 AMNESTY WERE ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS.  WE HAVE ASSUMED, ON THE BASIS OF PAST </p><p>RELEASES, THAT A SIZEABLE PROPORTION OF RECENTLY </p><p>LIBERATED PRISONERS WERE DETAINEES SUSPECTED OF HAVING </p><p>HAD SOME SORT OF CONNECTION TO THE OUTLAWED SYRIAN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  THE "AL-NAHAR" AND IRANIAN ITEMS </p><p>ARE THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE THAT LEBANESE </p><p>DETAINEES ARE ALSO BENEFITING FROM THE DECEMBER 1 </p><p>AMNESTY.  THE TAWHID AL-ISLAMI FOUGHT THE SYRIAN ARMY IN </p><p>TRIPOLI OFF AND ON UNTIL 1985, WHEN (FOLLOWING THE </p><p>TAWHID\'S KIDNAPPING OF SOVIET DIPLOMATS) THE SYRIANS </p><p>INVESTED IN BITTER STREET FIGHTING TO NEUTRALIZE THE </p><p>TAWHID AS A SECURITY THREAT.  THERE HAS FOR A LONG TIME </p><p>BEEN A BIZARRE CONNECTION BETWEEN SHIA IRAN AND TAWHID </p><p>LEADER SAID SHA\'BAN WHICH, IN THE MID-1980\'S, WAS AN </p><p>IRRITANT IN SYRIAN-IRANIAN RELATIONS.  THE TAWHID WENT </p><p>UNDERGROUND AFTER THE EVENTS OF 1985 AND MAY HAVE </p><p>EVENTUALLY REACHED A MODUS VIVENDI WITH THE SYRIANS THAT </p><p>PERMITS IT TO OPERATE OPENLY IN SOME FORM, THOUGH WE </p><p>DEFER TO EMBASSY BEIRUT AND WASHINGTON ANALYSTS FOR </p><p>DEFINITIVE WORD ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE TAWHID. </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
