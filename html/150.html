<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KAMPALA 00184 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PHUM, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH MUSEVENI. </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY: </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED BY PAO MET WITH UGANDAN PRESIDENT </p><p>YOWERI MUSEVENI FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS AT STATE HOUSE ENTEBBE </p><p>JANUARY 15.  THE MAJORITY OF THE MEETING CONCENTRATED ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND NRA USE OF "3-PIECE TIE".  AMBASSADOR </p><p>DESCRIBED HIS EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE US TRADERS TO JOIN IN </p><p>BARTER TRADE WITH UGANDA.  MUSEVENI WELCOMED US WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO RESPOND TO RECENT PL-480 REQUEST.  THE PRESIDENT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT DESPITE SOME RECENT SHARP ENGAGEMENTS WITH UNLA </p><p>REMNANTS IN THE NORTH, HE FELT THAT THE SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>IN THE NORTH WAS QUICKLY COMING UNDER CONTROL.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM COULD BE AT AN END WITHIN TWO MONTHS.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>CASTIGATED THE FOREIGN MINISTRY FOR ITS INEPTITUDE IN </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE A VISIT FOR HIM TO THE UNITED STATES </p><p>LAST YEAR, AND ASKED THE AMBASSADOR\'S ASSISTANCE IN PROPERLY </p><p>WORKING OUT A VISIT TO WASHINGTON AND A CALL ON PRESIDENT </p><p>REAGAN THIS FALL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HUMAN RIGHTS: </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT UGANDA HAD SUFFERED A "HANGOVER" </p><p>FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF THE AMIN AND OBOTE PERIODS </p><p>AND THAT IN RECENT MONTHS THE SPECIAL HUMAN RIGHTS SCRUTINY </p><p>THAT HAD BEEN APPLIED BY THE USG TO THINGS SUCH AS MULTI- </p><p>LATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS TO UGANDA HAD EASED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE IMPROVED HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE OF THE NRM </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE USG WOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS SITUATION IN UGANDA CLOSELY AND HOPED THAT THE FORMER </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON TREASON </p><p>CHARGES WOULD SOON COME TO TRIAL AND RECEIVE THE FULL </p><p>PROTECTION OF THE LAW DURING THE HEARING OF THEIR CASES.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT SAID THERE NEED NOT BE ANY FEAR ON THAT SCORE AS </p><p>THE TRIALS WOULD TAKE PLACE SOON.  HE ADDED THAT IF THERE WAS </p><p>NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BRING A PARTICULAR CASE TO TRIAL THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL CONCERNED WOULD BE RELEASED.  BASED UPON HIS </p><p>MONITORING OF THE INVESTIGATION SO FAR, HE FELT THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD BE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BRING SOME TO TRIAL, WHILE </p><p>OTHERS IN CUSTODY WOULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT </p><p>EVIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WAS DISTURBED TO HEAR THAT THE </p><p>NRA WAS USING THE "3-PIECE TIE" IN THE NORTH AS A MEANS OF </p><p>EXTRACTING INFORMATION DURING THE INTERROGATION OF PRISONERS. </p><p>MUSEVENI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 3-PIECE TIE WAS BEING USED </p><p>AND WONDERED WHY IT SHOULD CONCERN OUTSIDE OBSERVERS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT THE INFLICTION OF PAIN TO ELICIT </p><p>INFORMATION FROM A DETAINEE WAS TORTURE AND A VIOLATION OF </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, ADDING THAT HE HAD HEARD OF CASES WHERE </p><p>GANGRENE HAD DEVELOPED AND ARMS HAD TO BE AMPUTATED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE USE OF THE 3-PIECE TIE.  MUSEVENI PROTESTED </p><p>THAT IF PROPERLY APPLIED THE 3-PIECE TIE SHOULD NOT RESULT </p><p>IN SUCH INJURY.  HE WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT WITHOUT ITS USE </p><p>THE NRA WOULD BE SEVERELY HAMPERED IN BRINGING PEACE TO TESO </p><p>AND SOUTH KARAMOJA WHICH WERE CURRENTLY BEING PLAGUED BY </p><p>ARMED RUSTLERS.  "I DON\'T LIKE CRUELTY BUT WE MUST HAVE </p><p>TOUGHNESS," CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT.  "THESE PEOPLE ARE </p><p>USED TO A ROUGH LIFE; THEY ARE NOT PUNISHED BY BEING LOCKED </p><p>UP.  IF YOU\'RE NOT TOUGH WITH LAWLESS ELEMENTS, THE LAW </p><p>ABIDING FEAR TO TALK.  IF YOU JUST USE VERBAL INTERROGATION, </p><p>IT WON\'T GET ANYWHERE."  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE USE </p><p>OF TORTURE COULD NOT BE RATIONALIZED BY CLAIMS THAT IT WAS </p><p>USED IN THE PURSUIT OF A "GOOD CAUSE."  "THE 3-PIECE TIE IS </p><p>A FORM OF TORTURE AND CLEARLY A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE WHICH IF </p><p>CONTINUED BY THE NRA WILL SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE FAVORABLE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS REPUTATION WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE </p><p>NEW NRM GOVERNMENT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN RESPONSE TO MUSEVENI\'S REQUEST THAT THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DEFINE TORTURE THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO </p><p>OBTAIN A PRECISE DEFINITION FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS </p><p>IN WASHINGTON, BUT THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THE </p><p>INFLICTION OF PAIN TO ELICIT INFORMATION WAS CLEARLY TORTURE </p><p>AND A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION.  THE PRESIDENT REJOINED THAT </p><p>HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN HURTING ANYONE BUT SIMPLY WANTED </p><p>TO BRING STABILITY.  THERE WAS A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </p><p>UGANDA AND THE WEST.  THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT IF HE </p><p>TRIED TO USE MORE HUMANE METHODS HE WOULD BE SWIMMING </p><p>AGAINST THE TIDE OF POPULAR OPINION.  THE POPULAR VIEW IS </p><p>THAT THIEVES SHOULD BE HURT.  MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THE LEGAL </p><p>MACHINERY IS HOPELESS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE TAKE THE LAW </p><p>INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE DID NOT WANT </p><p>TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT IF THE NRA PERSISTED IN THE USE </p><p>OF THE 3-PIECE TIE THE GOVERNMENT\'S CLAIM THAT THEY WERE </p><p>TRULY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS UNPOPULAR REGIMES WOULD HAVE </p><p>A HOLLOW RING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  MUSEVENI\'S ATTEMPT TO LIGHTLY DISMISS AND </p><p>THEN DEFEND THE USE OF THE 3-PIECE TIE WAS DISAPPOINTING </p><p>AND SOMEWHAT DISTURBING.  BASED ON HIS REACTIONS, I SUSPECT </p><p>THAT OUR INTERVENTION WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD BEEN </p><p>SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED ON IT.  THE EMBASSY WILL BE APPROACHING </p><p>OTHER EMBASSIES AND MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO REINFORCE </p><p>THIS DEMARCHE TO THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BARTER TRADE: </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD NOT REVIEW THE OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS </p><p>OF THE BARTER TRADE AS IT ALREADY HAD BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL </p><p>WITH MANY MINISTERS.  HE SIMPLY WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW </p><p>THAT IF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS HELL-BENT ON PURSUING THIS FORM OF </p><p>TRADE, HE WANTED HIM TO KNOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF AMERICAN </p><p>FIRMS ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MIGHT FIND IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO DEAL WITH THEM </p><p>THAN TO PURSUE SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DEALS </p><p>CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED.  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT ONE </p><p>OF THE FRUSTRATIONS IN TRYING TO ASSIST AMERICAN COMPANIES, </p><p>SUCH AS GENERAL MOTORS, WHO WERE INTERESTED IN GETTING </p><p>INVOLVED IN BARTER TRADE WITH UGANDA WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>OBTAINING GOOD INFORMATION ON THE TYPES AND QUANTITIES OF </p><p>COMMODITIES UGANDA COULD MAKE AVAILABLE FOR BARTER.  REFERRING </p><p>TO THE CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>SAID "THESE FELLOWS ARE NOT SERIOUS" AND THEN INSTRUCTED HIS </p><p>PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO SEND THE AMBASSADOR THE REQUESTED </p><p>INFORMATION.  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT AN AMERICAN </p><p>BARTER TRADING FIRM, THE IBE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK, WOULD </p><p>BE SIGNING AN AGREEMENT-WITH THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE WHICH </p><p>WOUL? P?OIDE THE FRAMEWORK (E.G., SWING CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS) </p><p>FOR THEM TO TRADE WITH UGANDA.  IBE WOULD BE IN A POSITION </p><p>TO PROVIDE FARM EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT AND THEN TAKE PAYMENT </p><p>IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE TO LIQUIDATE THE DEBT.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>BEAMED THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DEAL HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO FOSTER AND THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR ENCOURAGING </p><p>AMERICAN FIRMS TO CONSIDER BARTERING WITH UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  U.S. ASSISTANCE: </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE PL-480 REQUEST RECENTLY RECEIVED </p><p>FROM THE GOU, COMMENTING THAT IT WAS RECEIVING EXPEDITIOUS </p><p>CONSIDERATION IN WASHINGTON.  MUSEVENI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN AN EVOLUTION IN GOVERNMENT THINKING REGARDING </p><p>FOOD AID AND THAT THERE WAS NOW AN APPRECIATION THAT PL-480 </p><p>COULD BE IMPORTANT IN MEETING NEAR-TERM FEEDING REQUIREMENTS, </p><p>AS WELL AS IN GENERATING RESOURCES FOR LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT THE EMBASSY WAS FOLLOWING VERY </p><p>CLOSELY GOVERNMENT\'S DIALOGUE WITH THE WORLD BANK AND THE IMF </p><p>ON ECONOMIC POLICY, EMPHASIZING THAT OUR LONGER-TERM </p><p>ASSISTANCE PLANNING WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE </p><p>GOVERNMENT REACHED SOME BASIC DECISIONS ON ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p>(E.G., EXCHANGE RATE ADJUSTMENT).  THE AMBASSADOR SHARED </p><p>WITH MUSEVENI A COPY OF A DRAFT PLANNING CONCEPT PAPER </p><p>PREPARED BY THE AID MISSION STATING THAT WHILE IT HAD NO </p><p>APPROVAL OR STATUS IN WASHINGTON, WE WOULD LIKE TO USE IT </p><p>AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING WITH GOVERNMENT ITS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES, AND HOW THE USG MIGHT BEST ASSIST. </p><p>MUSEVENI SAID HE WOULD READ THE PAPER AND LOOKED FORWARD </p><p>TO OPENING A DIALOGUE ON DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SUDAN SITUATION: </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MUSEVENI\'S ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WAS </p><p>HAPPENING IN THE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANY </p><p>USEFUL ROLE WHICH THE USG OR OTHER OUTSIDE PARTIES COULD </p><p>PLAY TO BRING THE PARTIES TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  MUSEVENI </p><p>SAID HE DID NOT HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME BUT THAT </p><p>HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.  HE SAID HE HAD ADVISED GARANG LAST </p><p>YEAR TO TALK SERIOUSLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM.  AS </p><p>FAR AS THE PRESIDENT WAS CONCERNED THE CONFLICT HAD TO BE </p><p>SOLVED POLITICALLY; HE COMMENTED THAT HE THOUGHT THE SUDANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS PARANOID ABOUT GARANG\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>ETHIOPIA.  GARANG WAS NOT IN ADDIS BECAUSE HE SUPPORTS THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT BUT RATHER BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS ONLY </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF SUPPORT.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THE </p><p>SUDANESE HAD MADE TWO FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS: THEY ASSERTED </p><p>THAT THE SUDAN WAS AN ARAB NATION AND AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SITUATION IN THE NORTH: </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ASKED HOW THE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH WAS </p><p>PROGRESSING AND MUSEVENI REPLIED THAT THE NRA\'S RECENT </p><p>OPERATIONS ALONG THE SUDANESE BORDER HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL. </p><p>THE UNLA REMNANTS LACKED A CENTRAL COMMAND, A COHERENT </p><p>STRATEGY, AND POLITICAL PROGRAM.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>REBELS HAD TAKEN THE NRA BY SURPRISE WHEN THEY ATTACKED </p><p>LAST AUGUST BUT FELT THAT THE NRA NOW HAD ADEQUATE FORCES </p><p>IN THE NORTH AND WAS IN A POSITION TO "FINISH THEM IN </p><p>TWO MONTHS."  HE OBSERVED THAT THE KEY PROBLEM IN TRYING </p><p>TO PURSUE A NEGOTIATED END TO THE CONFLICT WAS THAT THE NRA </p><p>WAS FACING PEOPLE WHO WERE "POLITICALLY PRIMITIVE."  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT EVIDENCE HAD RECENTLY COME TO THE NRA\'S </p><p>ATTENTION THAT THE UNLA FORCES WERE INVOKING WITHCRAFT </p><p>TO ENTHUSE THEIR FORCES.  IT WAS NOT WORKING AND WAS </p><p>LEADING TO THE LOPSIDED CASUALTY FIGURES IN THE NRA\'S </p><p>FAVOR. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MUSEVENI TRIP TO WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>WHEN THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ANY ISSUES </p><p>HE WANTED TO RAISE, MUSEVENI SAID HE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED </p><p>AND ANGERED BY THE POOR ADVICE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY WHEN IT RECOMMENDED HE VISIT WASHINGTON </p><p>LAST YEAR.  THAT SAID, THE PRESIDENT QUICKLY CONTINUED </p><p>THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT WASHINGTON LATER THIS YEAR. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS PLANNING TO </p><p>ATTEND THE COMMONWEALTH MEETING IN CANADA AND WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING THE UNGA.  THOSE TWO EVENTS </p><p>SUGGESTED A GENERAL TIMEFRAME FOR A VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p>WHICH THE AMBASSADOR WOULD SO RECOMMEND TO HIS GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT ARRANGING A MEETING </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AND COMMENTED </p><p>THAT HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED WHEN MUSEVENI DECIDED NOT TO </p><p>TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR, WHEN IT BECAME </p><p>APPARENT THAT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE.  A NUMBER OF VERY USEFUL MEETINGS WITH SENIOR </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION SHORT OF THE PRESIDENT, AND </p><p>KEY FIGURES IN THE CONGRESS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN ARRANGED.  ASSURING MUSEVENI THAT HE WOULD MAKE </p><p>HIS BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO ARRANGE A CALL ON PRESIDENT </p><p>REAGAN, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT SHOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE, </p><p>A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET OTHER INFLUENTIAL </p><p>PERSONALITIES IS STILL VERY MUCH IN HIS INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT: </p><p> </p><p>MUSEVENI OBVIOUSLY WANTS VERY BADLY TO VISIT WASHINGTON </p><p>AND CALL ON THE PRESIDENT, AND FINDS IT HARD TO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE, ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS </p><p>SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO EUROPE WHERE HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER </p><p>THATCHER, THE QUEEN, THE KING OF THE BELGIANS, THE POPE, </p><p>ETCETERA.  MUSEVENI KNOWS LITTLE OF THE WESTERN WORLD </p><p>AND A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL. </p><p>LET US START NOW TO TRY AND ARRANGE AN OFFICE CALL ON THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HIS TRAVEL TO NORTH AMERICA </p><p>IN THE FALL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOUDEK </p><p></p></div>
