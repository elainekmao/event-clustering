<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 10701 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALSO FOR INR/B AND INR/DB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PGOV, SO </p><p>SUBJ:  DISCUSSION WITH GENERAL MOHAMED ALI SAMANTAR </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SETTING:  ALTHOUGH GENERAL SAMANTAR CURRENTLY HOLDS </p><p>NO OFFICIAL POSITION, HE REMAINS ONE OF SOMALIA\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL POLITICAL FIGURES.  ACCORDINGLY, I CALLED ON </p><p>HIM AT HIS QUARTERS DECEMBER 4.  I FOUND HIM LIVING </p><p>IN A VERY LARGE AND ELABORATELY FURNISHED HOME WITHIN </p><p>THE PERIMETER OF THE MOGADISHU OFFICERS\' CLUB.  HE WAS </p><p>IN APPARENT GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS, ALTHOUGH JUDGING </p><p>BY THE CONDITION OF HIS FINGERS HE BITES HIS NAILS </p><p>A LOT. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  DOMESTIC POLITICS:  THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER, DEFENSE MINISTER, ARMY COMMANDER, ETC. </p><p>PUT NO DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE REGIME.  HE WAS </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE OPPOSITION FOR ITS ALLEGED COMPLICITY </p><p>IN THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAS PLAGUED MOGADISHU FOR </p><p>MONTHS.  (HE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE HEAVY FIGHTING </p><p>OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS TRIBAL IN ORIGIN.)  AFTER </p><p>BLAMING  THE OPPOSITION FOR MUCH OF THE OTHER VIOLENCE, </p><p>HE ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ITS LEADERS COULD EXPECT THE </p><p>NEW CONSTITUTION TO FUNCTION IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. </p><p>HE DID NOT ADVOCATE ABANDONMENT OF THE POLITICAL REFORM </p><p>PROCESS, BUT HE ALSO HAD THE FRANKNESS TO MAKE IT CLEAR </p><p>HE IS NOT ITS ARDENT SUPPORTER.  WHEN THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE </p><p>WAS RAISED, HIS OBJECTIVE FOR THE MEETING SEEMED LIMITED </p><p>TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CEASE-FIRE. </p><p>- </p><p>4. ISLAMIC FERMENT:  THE GENERAL SPOKE MOST INTERESTINGLY </p><p>ON THE SUBJECT OF TURBULENCE WITH THE LOCAL ISLAMIC </p><p>COMMUNITY.  WITH OBVIOUS REGRET, HE SAID FOREIGN </p><p>INFLUENCES ARE DISTURBING A COMMUNITY WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>NOTED FOR ITS TOLERANCE AND PEACEFULNESS.  THE VILLIANS </p><p>HE IDENTIFIED INCLUDED MILITANTS FOR THE SEVERAL SUFI </p><p>ORDERS WHICH HAVE LONG EXISTED IN SOMALIA, AS WELL AS </p><p>MORE RECENTLY ARRIVED SECTS, E.G. THE WAHHABI OF </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  ALTHOUGH HARDLY A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT, </p><p>SAMANTAR MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE YOUNG SOMALIS WHO </p><p>GO TO IRAQ TO STUDY ON IRAQI SCHOLARSHIPS RETURN AS </p><p>BAATHISTS.  FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, HE CONSIDERED THIS </p><p>ELEMENT AMONG THE MOST POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>QUITE LIMITED IN INFLUENCE AT THE MOMENT.  THE WHOLE </p><p>PHENOMENON OF RELIGIOUS FERMENT HE CONSIDERED MORE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FOR SOMALIA\'S FUTURE THAN IT IS AT </p><p>PRESENT, WHERE HE SAW ITS IMPACT AS MARGINAL. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  THE GULF:  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE COMBAT VETERAN </p><p>RAISED THE PROSPECTS OF WAR IN THE GULF.  HE DESCRIBED </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN, WHOM HE MET WHILE THEY WERE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AS A PARTICULARLY </p><p>AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS MAN.  HE PROFESSED DOUBT THAT </p><p>MANY SOMALIS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE REGIME\'S SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE COALITION BUT SUBSEQUENTLY CONCEDED THAT MANY </p><p>UNEDUCATED SOMALIS ADMIRE THE IRAQI LEADER FOR </p><p>DEFYING THE INFIDELS. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  PERSONAL ROLE:  WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO INDICATE </p><p>RESENTMENT, SAMANTAR MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE CONSIDERED </p><p>HIS CURRENT ABSENCE FROM OFFICE EXCEPTIONAL.  REFERRING </p><p>TO HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES AS "A POLITICAL MAN", HE </p><p>MADE NO SECRET OF THE FACT THAT HE REMAINS POLITICALLY </p><p>ACTIVE, ALBEIT FROM A POSITION ON THE SIDELINES </p><p>RATHER THAN CENTERFIELD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
