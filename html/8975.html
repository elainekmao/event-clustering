<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004061 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR EC AND CCC/FSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ENRG, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTROVERSY SWIRLS AROUND PETKIM PRIVATIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ANKARA 2130 (B) ANKARA 3784 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary: The first major sale in Turkey\'s </p><p>ambitious 2003 privatization program is nearing the finish </p><p>line, with the imminent submission of the winning bid for the </p><p>state petrochemical company Petkim to Turkey\'s High </p><p>Privatization Council for approval.  The tender is engulfed </p><p>in controversy, however, both because of the bid amount--too </p><p>low in the estimation of some, at USD 605 million, against a </p><p>pre-tender market capitalization of just over USD 1.1 </p><p>billion-- and because of the identity of the winning bidder: </p><p>Turkey\'s notorious Uzan family, well-known for its </p><p>telecommunications exploits and more recently stripped of the </p><p>concession contracts of its two power companies-- Kepez and </p><p>Cukorova Electric-- for persistent contract and legal </p><p>violations (ref b).  With a USD 4 billion revenue target for </p><p>the year, but only USD 12 million realized to date, </p><p>Privatization Administration (PA) officials stress that </p><p>completion of the sale at the bid price would mark an </p><p>important step forward.  They defend their decision to permit </p><p>the Uzans to participate, noting that the family has </p><p>fulfilled its obligations to the PA in the past, and they are </p><p>not permitted to consider bidders\' dealings  with other state </p><p>bodies.  Given Cem Uzan\'s emergence as a chief political </p><p>rival of the ruling AK Party and the controversy surrounding </p><p>the family, however, high council approval is not a foregone </p><p>conclusion.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A Lackluster Bidding War: PA Project head Meray Ekin </p><p>outlined the bidding process in a June 20 meeting with </p><p>Econoff and economic specialist.  Of the original five </p><p>bidders who submitted bids in April 2003, three remained in </p><p>the final round: the Uzan\'s Standart Kimya, Vakif Bank, and </p><p>Sanko and Zorlu holding (individual bidders in the first </p><p>round, who elected to join forces).  Speculation has swirled </p><p>around the presence of Vakif, a semi-state bank in the </p><p>process, with some market observers in Istanbul speculating </p><p>that it served as a stalking horse for the PA, enabling it to </p><p>set a floor price in the auction.  (Separately, Treasury </p><p>sources told us that the PA gave an instruction to Vakif to </p><p>bid, given legal requirements that at least three bidders </p><p>participate.)  For her part, Ekin dismissed such speculation, </p><p>suggesting instead that Vakif was acting as a front for an </p><p>Iranian group, but indicating that she did not have any </p><p>proof. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Price Controversy: In response to bidding demand, </p><p>the PA decided to sell the full 88.86 percent of the </p><p>company\'s shares that remain in government hands (the </p><p>original tender specified a range from 51 to 88.86 percent). </p><p>The Uzan\'s winning bid came in at USD 605 million.  The </p><p>Zorlu/Sanko partnership dropped out at USD 570 million (the </p><p>price one major Istanbul brokerage told us it expected the </p><p>company to bring).  Bidders are expected to pay 40 percent as </p><p>an immediate payment, and then 20 percent each year for three </p><p>years.  There is a 10 percent discount if the full price is </p><p>paid at the outset.  The amount of the Uzan\'s offer </p><p>immediately sparked controversy, with critics calling it a </p><p>"firesale" price, given that before the tender the company\'s </p><p>market capitalization on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (where </p><p>some 11 percent of shares are traded) approached USD 1.1 </p><p>billion.  (It has since dropped by over 20 percent.)  Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan, who serves as chair of the Privatization </p><p>High Council, added his voice to those who questioned the </p><p>sale price.  PA officials, however, defend the price, noting </p><p>that whoever takes over the company will need to invest at </p><p>least USD 1 billion to make the company productive and </p><p>efficient (a figure Ekin said all bidders accepted). </p><p>Separately market analysts at brokerages including HC </p><p>Istanbul and Global told us that they had anticipated a </p><p>figure between USD 500 and 570 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Controversial Winner: Adding to the controversy is </p><p>the identity of the winning bidder: the controversial Uzan </p><p>family, whose dealings in areas ranging from </p><p>telecommunications to electricity have sparked lawsuits and </p><p>complaints of deceptive and illegal business practices.  Most </p><p>famous for defrauding Motorola and Nokia out of nearly USD 2 </p><p>billion in supplier credits, the Uzans\' other business </p><p>practices have also been widely questioned.  In addition, </p><p>family scion Cem Uzan\'s Genc (Young) Party has played on a </p><p>set of nihilist, anti-American themes to emerge as the AK </p><p>party\'s most ardent challenger.  Ekin stressed, however, that </p><p>legally the PA had no basis for excluding the family from </p><p>participating in the Petkim tender: they had, she said, the </p><p>"best company record" with the PA regarding payments and </p><p>meeting privatization terms in the past.  She conceded that </p><p>the family\'s post-PA dealings with their companies were less </p><p>blameless, but noted that Turkish legislation does not permit </p><p>the PA to consider a bidder\'s dealings with other state </p><p>institutions.  Failure to pay taxes or meet obligations to </p><p>other parts of the GOT is not grounds for exclusion from the </p><p>bidding, she said, so the family\'s difficulties regarding its </p><p>power companies Cukorova and Kepez, which were stripped of </p><p>their government concessions for legal and contract </p><p>violations, "cannot legally be an obstacle."  (A point </p><p>Industry Minister Ali Coskun emphasized publicly following </p><p>the companies\' takeover.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Next Steps: After clearance by the PA, the Uzan </p><p>offer was submitted to Turkey\'s Competition Council, which </p><p>also cleared it on June 23, saying it posed no problems under </p><p>Turkey\'s competition law.  The final decision is thus left to </p><p>the high council, chaired by Erdogan and composed of four </p><p>other ministers.  The council\'s discretion is constrained </p><p>only by the need to preserve confidence in the privatization </p><p>process.  It thus does not need a legal pretext to disallow </p><p>the Uzan\'s bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) A Tough Call: Ekin stressed that because of the </p><p>large price difference between the Uzan and Zorlu bid, the </p><p>contract could not be awarded to the next highest bidder, if </p><p>the Uzan bid is not accepted by the high council.  Instead, </p><p>the process would have to start from scratch.  This, she </p><p>judged, would negatively impact the upcoming privatization of </p><p>Tekel (the state alcohol and tobacco monopoly) and Tupras </p><p>(the state refinery), and imperil the government\'s target of </p><p>USD 4 billion in privatization revenue for the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: The government faces a tough call on the </p><p>Petkim privatization, with political considerations-- both </p><p>normative and tactical-- mitigating against approval of the </p><p>tender, in the first place to keep the company out of the </p><p>hands of a notorious clan, and in the second in order to keep </p><p>the pressure on the family, which has been shaken by the </p><p>Cukorova and Kepez decision.  On the other hand, however, </p><p>rejection of the tender would deal a blow to government </p><p>attempts to jump-start its privatization program and make a </p><p>real dent in the year\'s ambitious revenue goal.  It would </p><p>also negatively impact upcoming privatizations, particularly </p><p>if officials continue to argue that the price is too low.  In </p><p>our contacts with GOT officials, we have stressed our hope </p><p>that the council will avoid second guessing the bid price, </p><p>and will not make its decision on that basis, but on other, </p><p>sounder (i.e. anti-corruption) grounds.  Clearly, the tender </p><p>has highlighted shortcomings in Turkey\'s privatization law, </p><p>in that broader requirements for bidders would have prevented </p><p>this embarrassing outcome. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
