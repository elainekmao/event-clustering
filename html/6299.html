<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 LAGOS 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: DON\'T SHOW ME THE MONEY; NIGERIA GOING </p><p>CASHLESS </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  As in many developing economies with high </p><p>inflation and a devalued currency, consumers in Nigeria </p><p>often must bring literally bags of money to the store </p><p>to make even routine purchases.  Checks are used almost </p><p>exclusively for business-to-business transactions, and </p><p>credit cards are accepted almost nowhere. Recently, the </p><p>use of pre-paid debit cards (known here as smart cards) </p><p>has been on the rise, and marketers hope the trend will </p><p>continue.  In fact, the U.S. Consulate General in Lagos </p><p>recently began accepting a smart card as the exclusive </p><p>payment method for nonimmigrant visa transactions, and </p><p>the British High Commission has followed suit.  Two </p><p>brands of smart cards backed by bank consortia are </p><p>leading the market, each with its own unique market </p><p>niche.  These novel businesses, along with others in </p><p>the finance industry that are considering ways to bring </p><p>revolving credit to the country, are banking on the </p><p>radical concept that a significant part of the Nigerian </p><p>economy may become cash-less in the coming years.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>A BAG OF MONEY FOR A BAG OF GROCERIES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Nigeria remains almost exclusively a cash-based </p><p>economy.  Checks are not used at the consumer level, </p><p>but rather are the province of business-to-business </p><p>transactions.  Credit cards are used almost nowhere, </p><p>both because of fraud concerns and because revolving </p><p>credit is not widely offered by Nigerian banks. </p><p>Occasional ATM machines can be found, but debit cards </p><p>are not in use.  Consumers in Nigeria must thus use </p><p>cash for almost all transactions, whether it be the </p><p>purchase of a bag of ground nuts from a street hawker, </p><p>the purchase of a family\'s groceries in a supermarket, </p><p>or the purchase of a used vehicle from a neighbor. </p><p>Adding to the inconvenience, Nigeria\'s highest </p><p>denomination bill is the 500 Naira note; just under </p><p>four dollars.  Accordingly, Nigerians and expats alike </p><p>are accustomed to carrying small sacks of cash for any </p><p>single purchase ranging several hundred dollars or </p><p>more, for their weekend shopping, or for any in-country </p><p>travel.  Payday for Nigerians also commonly involves </p><p>the transfer of small bags or bricks of cash. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. A new and growing financial product is slowly </p><p>changing the way Nigerians approach transactions. </p><p>Smart cards were launched in Nigeria almost five years </p><p>ago and are becoming increasingly available and </p><p>accepted for use, particularly in urban areas.  Smart </p><p>cards are reusable plastic cards containing an embedded </p><p>computer chip that records and manages a pre-loaded </p><p>balance of funds from which debits are deducted. </p><p>Industry sources report that smart card technology was </p><p>first widely utilized in France for secured access to </p><p>buildings.  The use of a computer chip to store and </p><p>manage data is considered less vulnerable to </p><p>unauthorized manipulation or to information theft than </p><p>the magnetic strips most commonly found on credit and </p><p>debit cards and access passes in the United States. </p><p>And while forms of disposable smart cards are used in </p><p>Europe and elsewhere for a variety of consumer </p><p>transactions, Paul Lawal, the Managing Director and </p><p>Chief Executive of the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement </p><p>System (NIBSS), told Econoff that the use of </p><p>reloadable, chip-based smart cards for financial </p><p>transactions is unique to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE PRODUCT AND THE PLAYERS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Smart cards are generally offered and administered </p><p>by consortia of banks.  They are designed to make </p><p>transactions easier and safer for consumers by </p><p>providing an alternative to regularly carrying and </p><p>producing large quantities of cash.  Smart cards are </p><p>similar to debit cards used in the United States, </p><p>except the card is generally not associated with </p><p>deposits kept in an open account.  Instead, a consumer </p><p>obtains a card at a bank and loads a sum of money onto </p><p>it. The card carries the issuing bank\'s logo, and </p><p>transactions are associated with that bank.  When the </p><p>consumer makes a purchase at a participating vendor, </p><p>swiping the card and entering a personal identification </p><p>number (PIN), the vendor\'s card-reader debits the </p><p>balance on the card and stores the charge.  The vendor </p><p>periodically takes the stored data from the reader to </p><p>the bank or other card issuer that the vendor </p><p>contracted with to receive payment from the charges. </p><p>The bank or issuer then settles all outstanding charges </p><p>across the consortium through the NIBSS.  When the </p><p>consumer spends the balance loaded onto the card, he or </p><p>she simply reloads a new balance at the issuing bank. </p><p>Vendors are charged a fee per transaction, usually a </p><p>percentage of the transaction amount.  For example, the </p><p>US Consulate General is charged 1.25 percent per </p><p>transaction for its use of smart cards for visa </p><p>transactions.  But banks and other card issuers make </p><p>most of their profit from smart cards by using the </p><p>"float" generated, that is, by earning interest on or </p><p>investing the value of the deposits made by their </p><p>cardholders when loading the smart cards, before </p><p>charges are made and cleared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Three companies offer smart cards in Nigeria, each </p><p>with a unique market niche.  The current leading smart </p><p>card brand is ValuCard, which was first introduced </p><p>nearly five years ago and is accepted by a wide variety </p><p>of stores and restaurants throughout Nigeria.  ValuCard </p><p>is backed by a consortium of approximately 40 banks, </p><p>including many of the largest and oldest in Nigeria. </p><p>ValuCard boasts that its consortium represents 90 </p><p>percent of the country\'s banking system, and has over </p><p>3,000 vendors in 50 cities nationwide.  Using software </p><p>developed by the Irish company CardBase Technology, </p><p>ValuCard offers perhaps the simplest but most limited </p><p>product available, in that the card is primarily a </p><p>reloadable payment method using a PIN, while other </p><p>cards offer a variety of payment services and options. </p><p>Further, the ValuCard customer can load his or her card </p><p>only at a branch of the bank from which the card was </p><p>issued, not from any ValuCard dealer.  However, </p><p>ValuCard offered the first card on the market, is </p><p>backed by the largest banks in the country and employs </p><p>an extensive marketing campaign, making it the leading </p><p>brand in Nigeria.  ValuCard is gradually expanding the </p><p>capabilities of its card, but remains focused on the </p><p>essential nature of its product.  Paul Lawal of the </p><p>NIBSS estimates that ValuCard services 60 percent of </p><p>the smart card market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. SmartPay is the second leading brand of smart card </p><p>in Nigeria.  The U.S. company Retriever Payment Systems </p><p>holds a 98 percent interest in SmartPay, which has been </p><p>on the market for about three years.  SmartPay is </p><p>backed by a consortium of over 30 banks, but most are </p><p>medium and small banks with limited geographic focus. </p><p>Only a few banks participate in both SmartPay and </p><p>ValuCard.  Where ValuCard centered its development on </p><p>consumer marketing and vendor distribution, SmartPay </p><p>focused its initial efforts on the software it uses for </p><p>transactions and offers a product of greater </p><p>versatility.  In addition to a reloadable, PIN-based </p><p>payment card, SmartPay offers a PIN-less function that </p><p>allows consumers to give their card to others to use up </p><p>to a relatively low-value ceiling (about $40).  For </p><p>example drivers may purchase fuel on behalf of their </p><p>employers without entering a PIN.  SmartPay cards can </p><p>be reloaded at any bank in the consortia, and SmartPay </p><p>offers debit card, ATM and credit functions to some of </p><p>its customers. Even though the SmartPay product is more </p><p>versatile and multifunctional than ValuCard, it has </p><p>suffered from a lack of marketing and is only now </p><p>attempting to garner a larger percentage of the smart </p><p>card market through strategic partnerships such as </p><p>foreign diplomatic mission consular services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The third player in the Nigerian smart card industry </p><p>is SecureTrust.  SecureTrust was also founded some </p><p>three years ago by the former IT manager of ValuCard, </p><p>after his ideas for what he felt was superior </p><p>technology were ignored by the industry leader.  He </p><p>focused his fledgling company\'s product development on </p><p>the technology of the smart card, using product design </p><p>and software developed by Visa and Proton Technology of </p><p>Belgium.  SecureTrust remains a very small player; it </p><p>is backed by only two or three banks, and is not used </p><p>by many consumers or recognized by many vendors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP - A VERY LONG WAY UP </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. NIBSS estimates that the use of smart cards for </p><p>financial transactions has increased roughly 30 percent </p><p>in the last 18 months.  However, data on the size of </p><p>the smart card market is conflicting.  While the </p><p>Managing Director of SmartPay states that the current </p><p>market totals only 100,000 cards, ValuCard asserts that </p><p>by the end of 2002 it had issued 180,000 cards. </p><p>ValuCard also claims an impressive and steady increase </p><p>in the value of its transactions per year since 1999, </p><p>when it recorded transactions worth 300 million Naira </p><p>($2.4 million). ValuCard reports that consumers used </p><p>its card for transactions worth one billion Naira ($8 </p><p>million) in 2000, six billion Naira ($47.6 million) in </p><p>2001, and over 16.6 billion Naira ($131.7 million) in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Still, according to NIBSS, 80 percent of consumer- </p><p>level transactions involve cash transfers, and 15 </p><p>percent are paid by check, leaving smart card companies </p><p>vying for a very small slice of Nigeria\'s market </p><p>transactions.  Nonetheless, NIBSS Chief Executive Lawal </p><p>notes a definite upward trend in the use of smart cards </p><p>amongst the educated population, which tends to have </p><p>more disposable income.  Along with mobile phones and </p><p>imported clothes, Lawal observes that educated, </p><p>professional Nigerians are using smart cards as a </p><p>status symbol, and predicts the demand for cashless </p><p>transactions will continue to rise amongst this </p><p>important segment of consumers as they become </p><p>increasingly accustomed to the use of credit and debit </p><p>cards in the United States and Europe.  Noting this </p><p>trend, Lawal told Econoff that financial institutions </p><p>in Nigeria are developing plans for revolving credit </p><p>accounts, and NIBSS is studying the telecommunications </p><p>infrastructur requirements and improvements needed in </p><p>the country to sustain debit card transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The U.S. Consulate General Lagos began accepting </p><p>ValuCard as the exclusive method of payment for </p><p>nonimmigrant visa fees in December 2002, in addition to </p><p>its use for occasional warehouse disposal sales and </p><p>fees associated with the Educational Advising Center. </p><p>Similarly, the British High Commission in Abuja </p><p>launched a ValuCard payment system on March 4, 2003. </p><p>Both of these developments will cause a significant </p><p>increase in the issuance of smart cards, as each </p><p>country\'s diplomatic mission in Nigeria services tens </p><p>of thousands of applicants each year, and card issuers </p><p>are pitching other missions to follow suit.  Smart card </p><p>issuers also hope that the acceptance of ValuCard by </p><p>foreign missions will translate into an increase in the </p><p>number of vendors accepting their cards, as consumers </p><p>across socio-economic strata become aware of the </p><p>product and demand the service from merchants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. COMMENT: There are limits to going cashless in </p><p>Nigeria.  The unofficial economy -- the street vendors, </p><p>hawkers, and product and service providers who come to </p><p>their customers\' homes and whose marketing is </p><p>exclusively word-of-mouth -- is a major part of the </p><p>Nigerian economic structure and social fabric.  Until </p><p>smart card readers are made available to these </p><p>merchants and craftsmen, cash will remain the </p><p>overwhelmingly predominant method of payment in </p><p>Nigeria.  Also, Econoff has heard complaints that smart </p><p>card readers are inoperable frequently enough that </p><p>consumers feel the need to carry cash anyway and simply </p><p>use their smart card where possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. COMMENT CONTINUED: Nonetheless, if demand does </p><p>continue for this product, banks may develop the </p><p>infrastructure needed to support other products and </p><p>services such as revolving credit accounts and debit </p><p>transactions.  To do so would require extensive build- </p><p>outs to Nigeria\'s weak telecommunications </p><p>infrastructure, but and the rise of GSM use has made </p><p>land-line repair and expansion a low priority. Before </p><p>credit and debit become widely used, Nigeria will </p><p>require further anti-fraud advances, both in prevention </p><p>and prosecution.  Today, even where credit cards are </p><p>accepted, mostly in a few hotels in Abuja and Lagos, </p><p>most residents and visitors to Nigeria dislike using </p><p>them for fear of financial crime.  If security </p><p>improves, increased electronic transfers of funds could </p><p>help reduce petty corruption and embezzlement because </p><p>less cash would change hands, and law enforcement could </p><p>better monitor and trace transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. COMMENT CONTINUED: In the meantime, smart card </p><p>companies may continue to see large increases in the </p><p>value of transactions.  Even if the number of </p><p>transactions or cards issued remains relatively limited </p><p>in scope or grows flat, more people will use cards for </p><p>big-ticket items like vehicle purchases.  Any </p><p>significant or prolonged currency depreciation should </p><p>make smart cards even more attractive to consumers. </p><p>Ultimately, like most business opportunities in </p><p>Nigeria, there is money to be made in the smart card </p><p>and related services industry, if companies accept the </p><p>challenges of weak infrastructure and vulnerable </p><p>security.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
