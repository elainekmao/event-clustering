THE USDA TEAM MET FIRST WITH WFP\'S CHIEF OF THE </p><p>PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING BRANCH, VLADMIRO GAROFALO, </p><p>DURING WHICH THEY DISCUSSED THE METHODOLOGY OF COMMODITY </p><p>PROCUREMENT. THIS PRIMARILY DEALT WITH NON-U.S. DONATIONS, </p><p>WHETHER IN-KIND OR CASH DONATIONS. THE MODUS OPERANDI FOR </p><p>WFP COMMODITY PROCUREMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>- EITHER: LOCAL IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, REGIONAL PURCHASES IN </p><p>A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, OR INTERNATIONAL PURCHASES ON THE </p><p>WORLD MARKET (THESE PRESENTLY EQUATE TO 50 PERCENT OF WFP\'S </p><p>COMMODITY PROCUREMENTS); </p><p> </p><p>- LOAD SURVEYS ARE DONE ON ALL CARGOES WITH TALLIES; </p><p> </p><p>- SURVEYS ARE CONTRACTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT LONG </p><p>TERM.

BOWERS AND LIEM MET WITH ANTONIO DI NUCCI, WFP SYSTEMS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, TO DISCUSS WFP\'S COMMODITY TRACKING </p><p>SYSTEM CALLED COMPAS.  THIS SYSTEM IS USED BY WFP TO TRACK </p><p>ALL WFP COMMODITY MOVEMENTS INCLUDING PROGRAM POST-DELIVERY </p><p>IN-COUNTRY LOSSES (I.E., FROM THE DESTINATION PORT OF ENTRY </p><p>ONWARDS). COMPAS IS WRITTEN IN ORACLE AND IS A DISTRIBUTED, </p><p>THICK CLIENT ENVIRONMENT, PROGRAM.  THE DATABASE IS </p><p>REPLICATED MANY TIMES, FROM THE COUNTRY LEVEL TO THE </p><p>REGIONAL LEVEL AND FINALLY TO WFP HEADQUARTERS.  NOTE: THERE </p><p>ARE APPROXIMATELY 300 WFP OFFICES/SUB-OFFICES RUNNING THE </p><p>COMPAS PROGRAM AT PRESENT. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMPAS TRACKS THE COMMODITY BY CONSIGNMENT, INCLUDING </p><p>WHERE ONE SHIPPING INSTRUCTION (SI) MAY BE BROKEN DOWN INTO </p><p>SEVERAL CONSIGNMENTS. IT RECORDS TRUCK DISPATCHES, BY THE </p><p>INPUT OF WEIGHT BILL INFORMATION, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE </p><p>CONDITION OF COMMODITIES RECEIVED AT THE DESTINATION </p><p>WAREHOUSE(S).

NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) (BOTH INDIGENOUS </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL) ARE WFP\'S PARTNERS IN THE ACTUAL FEEDING </p><p>PROCESS.  WFP CONSIGNS THE FOOD AT THE EXTENDED DELIVERY </p><p>POINT (OR AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL) TO THE NGO, AND THE NGO THEN </p><p>REPORTS BACK TO WFP ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FED AND THE </p><p>COMMODITY QUANTITIES ACTUALLY DELIVERED.  COMPAS APPEARS TO </p><p>BE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM FOR TRACKING LOSSES; HOWEVER, THE </p><p>OBVIOUS DOWNSIDE IS THE "THICK CLIENT ENVIRONMENT," MEANING </p><p>SOFTWARE MUST RESIDE ON EACH PERSON\'S PC, WHICH MAKES SYSTEM </p><p>UPGRADES/REPLICATION COMPLEX. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>WFP\'S INFORMATION NETWORK AND GLOBAL SYSTEM (WINGS) </p><p>FINANCIAL CONTROL SYSTEM REVIEWED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE TEAM RECEIVED A WALK-THROUGH OF WFP\'S WINGS SYSTEM. </p><p>WINGS IS A COMMERCIAL, OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) "SAP" PACKAGE </p><p>THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED FOR USE BY WFP.  THE TEAM DISCUSSED </p><p>THE SYSTEM\'S ADAPTABILITY AND HOW WFP MIGHT ELECTRONICALLY </p><p>SHARE INFORMATION WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>WFP\'S WINGS AND USDA\'S FOOD AID REQUEST ENTRY SYSTEM (FARES) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00081  02 OF 03  091542Z </p><p>8.  THE TEAM MET WITH KEN HERMAN, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER </p><p>AND DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY </p><p>DIVISION, AND ROBERT BAYNE, CHIEF OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, TO DISCUSS THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE TWO </p><p>SYSTEMS AND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR WINGS TO BE "BRIDGED" </p><p>TO THE FARES SYSTEM.  HERMAN WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE FARES </p><p>SYSTEM AND POSITIVE ON DEVELOPING INTERNAL LINKS TO PERMIT </p><p>THE TWO SYSTEMS TO SHARE INFORMATION. HERMAN AND  BAYNE </p><p>AGREED TO "TRANSLATE" TABLES THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN THE TWO </p><p>SYSTEMS, SUCH AS COMMODITY AND COUNTRY CODES.  THIS </p><p>TRANSLATION WILL ENABLE BOTH USERS TO READ AND PROCESS </p><p>APPROPRIATE FILES. THE USDA TEAM GAVE HERMAN AND BAYNE A </p><p>USDA TEST SHIPPING INSTRUCTION XML FORMAT.  WFP AGREED TO </p><p>DEDICATE THE RESOURCES TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF THE </p><p>WINGS SYSTEM AND TO SEND IT ALONG TO USDA/FSA IN THE </p><p>PROPOSED FORMAT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE TEAM ALSO MET WITH LYNNE FAIRSERVICE, CHIEF OF THE </p><p>ENTERPRISE SERVICES BRANCH, AND EDGARDO YU OF THE SYSTEMS </p><p>SUPPORT BRANCH.

THE TEAM GAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FARES SYSTEM TO </p><p>SEVERAL WFP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING ITS INTERNAL AUDIT </p><p>DIVISION.  WFP\'S QUESTIONS CENTERED ON THE SYSTEM\'S </p><p>DEPENDABILITY, SECURITY, FLEXIBILITY AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00081  02 OF 03  091542Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  TEAM MEMBERS ALSO CONDUCTED PRELIMINARY TRAINING FOR </p><p>WFP PERSONNEL THAT WOULD BE DESIGNATED FOR INPUTTING </p><p>SHIPPING INSTRUCTION DATA INTO THE FARES SYSTEM.  THIS DATA </p><p>WOULD BE INPUTTED MANUALLY FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF FARES, </p><p>UNTIL THE ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF DATA IS COMPLETED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>WFP\'S IN-COUNTRY COMMODITY LOSSES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.

DOWELL AND COMBES EXPLAINED HOW WFP IS THE WORLD\'S </p><p>LARGEST FOOD AID MOVER. IT WAS DISCUSSED HOW USDA AND WFP </p><p>CAN BETTER SHARE LOSS DATA SO TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON </p><p>CHANGES WHERE APPROPRIATE ON PACKAGING USED FOR FOOD AID </p><p>PROGRAMS.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST WOULD BE FEEDBACK ON THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HIGH PERFORMANCE BAG USED FOR U.S. </p><p>PROCESSED/FORTIFIED PRODUCTS.
