<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 005405 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: OADR 1.6X5 </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, PGOV, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: REGARDLESS OF AGE SENIORITY, </p><p>          PRINCE MISH\'AL IS NOT A CONTENDER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. RIYADH 5123, B. STATE 282410 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE KATTOUF: 1.5B. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p></p><p>2.  (C)  THE BODY OF EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT CONTRARY </p><p>TO SOME PUBLISHED REPORTS, PRINCE MISH\'AL (AS WELL AS </p><p>THE DECEASED PRINCE ABD AL-MUHSIN) WAS BORN BEFORE </p><p>MINDEF SULTAN.  HOWEVER, MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY IN AGE DOES </p><p>NOT MAKE HIM A SUCCESSION CANDIDATE, SUFFERING AS HE </p><p>DOES FROM SEVERAL STRIKES: A NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE, </p><p>A LACKLUSTER RECORD IN GOVERNMENT OFFICE, AND A </p><p>REPUTATION FOR ARGUING WITH HIS BROTHERS.  SULTAN\'S </p><p>ECLIPSE OF MISH\'AL, THE SEVENTH TIME A SENIOR SON OF </p><p>KING ABD AL-AZIZ HAS BEEN PASSED OVER, IS A MEASURE OF </p><p>THE STRICT CRITERIA APPLIED TO SUCCESSION CANDIDATES. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PRINCE MISH\'AL IS OLDER </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN A SEARCH OF OUR BIOGRAPHIC FILES, AND IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UK EMBASSY ROYAL FAMILY WATCHER, </p><p>THERE APPEARS TO BE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE THAT BOTH </p><p>MISH\'AL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ AND ABD AL-MUHSIN BIN ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ ARE/WERE OLDER THAN MINDEF SULTAN.  ABD </p><p>AL-MUHSIN\'S DEATH IN 1985 MAKES THE POINT MOOT, BUT </p><p>MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY IN AGE OVER SULTAN ADDS TO THE BODY </p><p>OF EVIDENCE THAT THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE AL SAUD CAN AND </p><p>DO EXCLUDE FROM SUCCESSION THOSE FOUND LACKING IN </p><p>LINEAGE, LEADERSHIP, AND PERSONAL CHARACTER. </p><p>HISTORICALLY, MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY TO SULTAN WAS EVIDENT </p><p>IN: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MARCH 29, 1964 PETITION BY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY URGING CROWN PRINCE FAYSAL TO EXERCISE THE POWERS </p><p>OF KING:  MISH\'AL, THEN THE AMIR OF MECCA, WAS THE 20TH </p><p>SIGNATOR (ABD AL-MUHSIN WAS 17TH), WHILE MINDEF SULTAN </p><p>WAS THE 24TH. </p><p> </p><p>-- PRESS REPORTS OF THE DEATH OF KING KHALID IN 1982: </p><p>MISH\'AL, THEN OUT OF GOVERNMENT, WAS LISTED AHEAD OF </p><p>MINDEF SULTAN IN THE REPORT OF THOSE ATTENDING THE </p><p>FUNERAL PRAYER. </p><p> </p><p>-- REFTEL (A) ACCOUNTS OF THE FUNERAL OF THE SAUD </p><p>AL-KABIR ELDER: AGAIN, PROTOCOL PLACED MISH\'AL AHEAD OF </p><p>SULTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- KING FAHD\'S DECEMBER 5, 1995 HOSPITAL MAJLIS: MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, THE TELEVISED HOSPITAL MAJLIS, IN WHICH THE </p><p>KING\'S BROTHERS WERE SEATED ALONG THE WALL IN STRICT </p><p>BIRTH PECKING ORDER, HAD MISH\'AL SECOND TO BANDAR BIN </p><p>ABD AL-AZIZ.  SEATED NEXT TO MISH\'AL WAS SULTAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE UK EMBASSY ROYAL WATCHER CHECKED THEIR COPY </p><p>OF LEES\' "HANDBOOK OF THE AL SAUD," WHICH WE BELIEVE IS </p><p>THE SOURCE OF THE MISINFORMATION, AND REPORTED THAT </p><p>SOMEONE HAD ANNOTATED THE BOOK IN PEN TO REFLECT BOTH </p><p>MISH\'AL\'S AND ABD AL-MUHSIN\'S SENIORITY TO SULTAN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>MISH\'AL BOWS OUT OF SUCCESSION - ALBEIT UNGRACEFULLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  IN MARCH 1992, THE CROWN PRINCE\'S PRINCIPAL </p><p>ADVISER, SHAYKH ABD AL-MUHSIN AL-TUWAIJRI, RELATED </p><p>MISH\'AL\'S EXTREME UNHAPPINESS WITH NOT BEING SELECTED </p><p>SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IN 1982, DESPITE HIS </p><p>SENIORITY IN AGE TO MINDEF SULTAN.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>TUWAIJRI, THE DESIGNATION OF SULTAN WAS MADE QUICKLY AND </p><p>ONLY BY THE THREE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED -- FAHD, </p><p>ABDULLAH, AND SULTAN.  TUWAIJRI NOTED THAT MISH\'AL </p><p>COMPLAINED TO BANDAR BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO TOOK UP HIS </p><p>CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  IN THE INTERVENING YEARS, HOWEVER, MISH\'AL HAS </p><p>RECONCILED HIMSELF TO THE FACT THAT HIS IMMEDIATE </p><p>BROTHERS FIND HIM LACKING IN THE QUALITIES THEY DESIRE </p><p>IN A KING.  (NOTE: MISH\'AL HAD THREE STRIKES AGAINST </p><p>HIM: HIS NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE, HIS LACKLUSTER </p><p>RECORD AS A PUBLIC SERVANT, AND HIS ARGUMENTATIVE </p><p>REPUTATION.)  THIS RECOGNITION HAS BEEN MADE PUBLICLY </p><p>AND PRIVATELY.  IN A 1992 INTERVIEW WITH THE SAUDI </p><p>NEWSPAPER "AL-MADINAH," MISH\'AL DECLARED HIS FEALTY TO </p><p>FAHD AND ABDULLAH AND NOTED THAT "I PERSONALLY DO NOT </p><p>ENVY THEIR LIVES WHICH ARE FULL OF SERVICE FOR ALL; </p><p>WHOEVER LEADS SUCH A LIFE MUST BE SHOULDERING A </p><p>BURDENSOME DUTY."  AND, IN A JUNE 1995 CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR, MISH\'AL STATED THAT HE HOPED "NEVER TO </p><p>BE AN OFFICIAL." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>COMMENT: MANIPULATING THE SUCCESSION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MISH\'AL AND ABD AL-MUHSIN\'S </p><p>CHRONOLOGICAL SENIORITY TO SULTAN, ON SEVEN OCCASIONS </p><p>THE SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ HAVE PASSED OVER WOULD-BE </p><p>CONTENDERS TO THE POSITION OF KING.  WHILE SENIORITY IS </p><p>CRITICAL TO ENTERING THE SUCCESSION LINE-UP (AS SECOND </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OR CROWN PRINCE), SO TOO ARE </p><p>MATERNAL SAUDI LINEAGE, PERSONAL CHARACTER, AND </p><p>DEMONSTRATED LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL.  MEASURED AGAINST </p><p>THESE CRITERIA, ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE 25 SURVIVING SONS </p><p>OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ SHOULD REALISTICALLY BE CONSIDERED </p><p>PRESENT AND POTENTIAL POWERBROKERS.  SEPTEL WILL ANALYZE </p><p>SUCCESSION POSSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
