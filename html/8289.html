<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000752 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: CEM UZAN STUMPS YOUTH IN ISTANBUL </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Genc Party leader Cem Uzan\'s recent speech </p><p>to a gathering of university student leaders in Istanbul </p><p>provided insight into both his political skills and </p><p>shortcomings as he seeks to build on his surprisingly strong </p><p>showing in last year\'s election.  While charismatic in some </p><p>ways, Uzan failed significantly to address key student </p><p>concerns about employment and education reform in the Q and A </p><p>session.  Uzan also seems to have changed targets of </p><p>criticism, saying nothing about the United States and taking </p><p>only a brief swipe at the IMF.  Instead, Uzan railed at </p><p>length against the European Customs Union (though not the EU, </p><p>interestingly).  If Uzan is to burnish his up-and-coming </p><p>image and appear to voters as a serious candidate, he will </p><p>have to understand the feelings of Turkish voters on more </p><p>issues than just the pain of international integration.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Heeeeeere\'s Cemmy! </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) A youthful politician bounds onto stage.  The applause </p><p>of the 1,400-person crowd rise to a near roar as he takes off </p><p>his blazer, and puts on the youth conference\'s t-shirt.  Live </p><p>Star TV (owned by Uzan) cameras zoom in on the podium, while </p><p>a boom camera pans through the crowd.  As a media </p><p>opportunity, Cem Uzan\'s recent speech at a "GencNet" </p><p>conference at Istanbul\'s Yeditepe University began very well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) GencNet, a web site devoted to civic action by youth, </p><p>is supported by both the International Republican Institute </p><p>(IRI) and the ARI Movement, a local NGO which works to </p><p>develop civil society in Turkey.  GencNet\'s basic message to </p><p>Turkish youth is "get involved," and this year\'s conference </p><p>allowed youth to vote on who they wanted for the keynote </p><p>speaker.  Answer: Cem Uzan, leader of Genc (Youth) Party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Proud Entry for Turkey </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Uzan\'s speech touched on all the major "hot topics" of </p><p>Turkish politics: war in Iraq, economic crisis, relations </p><p>with the EU and the US, and the Cyprus question. </p><p>Interestingly, though Uzan made passing reference to his </p><p>dislike for Turkey\'s "subservience" to IMF demands, he </p><p>refrained from further comment.  Instead, he blamed a host of </p><p>Turkish economic woes  (including joblessness, and drops in </p><p>agricultural and industrial exports) on the European Customs </p><p>Union, of which Turkey is a member. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Stating he believed Turkey to have lost USD 70 billion </p><p>in customs revenues in the last seven years as a result of </p><p>the customs union membership, Uzan said that the EU was </p><p>charging Turkey "the price for EU membership" without </p><p>providing "the product" (i.e. full membership).  In a further </p><p>political contortion, Uzan claimed to be pro-EU, but said </p><p>that Turkey must enter the European Union "proudly, not </p><p>begging to be accepted."  However, he said he believed that </p><p>in the future, the EU would be a superpower, and if Turkey </p><p>were to join, it would be "part of that superpower." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Twice in the course of the Q and A session, Uzan </p><p>visibly failed to address the questions posed to him </p><p>(questions for Uzan were submitted to the GencNet web site </p><p>and did not seem to have been given in advance to Uzan).  In </p><p>both cases, the concerns were specific to Turkish university </p><p>students, and resulted effectively in meandering non-answers </p><p>from Uzan.  In response to a roundly-applauded question on </p><p>what he would do as a future Prime Minister to encourage </p><p>post-university job prospects, especially in light of his </p><p>pledge to quadruple the number of Turkish universities, and </p><p>(as the questioner pointed out) the difficulty graduates </p><p>already face in the job market, Uzan blamed customs union </p><p>membership as the cause of lost jobs.  He added that his </p><p>focus is on raising the number of universities; the question </p><p>of employment is unrelated.  His answer was not applauded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>I said "no," but AK should have said "yes" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) When asked about his position on the war in Iraq, Uzan </p><p>made reference to several full-page adds he took out in his </p><p>family\'s newspapers and elsewhere.  "As you all know, I was </p><p>against this war in Iraq, remembering the losses Turkey </p><p>suffered in the first Gulf War.  However, the AK government </p><p>was inexperienced, and started bargaining, rather than </p><p>looking after Turkey\'s strategic interests.  If the motion </p><p>(to allow the US bases and transit through Turkey) had been </p><p>approved, Turkey would have gotten a seat at the table to </p><p>decide the future of Iraq.  The problem is not US-Turkish </p><p>relations, but Turkey\'s bargaining approach to the issue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Uzan benefited from slick public relations advice, </p><p>lumpenproletariat glee at his ability to swindle Motorola out </p><p>of USD 2 billion, and his widespread ownership of television </p><p>and press outlets in the Fall 2002 general election campaign, </p><p>and again in his early-2003 anti-US/anti-war media campaign. </p><p>However, his performance at the GencNet Conference suggests a </p><p>lack of knowledge on a variety of significant issues, </p><p>including higher education, employment, national security, </p><p>and Cyprus.  Additionally, Uzan\'s schizophrenic positions on </p><p>the EU and war in Iraq serve to muddle his message.  The </p><p>run-up to November\'s election was a sprint for Uzan.  Any </p><p>future aspirations for parliament will be more of a political </p><p>"marathon," and require a broader and more persuasive message </p><p>than he has heretofore displayed.  We will continue to press </p><p>Genc Party contacts as well on Uzan\'s defrauding of Motorola. </p><p> END COMMENT. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
