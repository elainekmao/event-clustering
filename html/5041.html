<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000067 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "War on Iraq a threat to world peace </p><p>      and security" the independent "Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>      January 9 editorial to discouraging the United States from </p><p>      using force against Iraq, saying "going to war with Iraq </p><p>      does definitely endanger world peace because it has the </p><p>      potential to spark a Third World War."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Since the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York\'s </p><p>      World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington, </p><p>      the U. S. Government has, through its `war against </p><p>      terrorism\' campaign, behaved as if it is entitled to </p><p>      attack any country it perceives to pose a threat to </p><p>      its own security, and to a lesser degree, that of </p><p>      the world at large.  Its military campaign against </p><p>      the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was a direct </p><p>      response to what was obviously an embarrassing </p><p>      humiliation for a country that is the undisputed </p><p>      superpower of the world in both economic and </p><p>      military terms.  It has been said that the manner in </p><p>      which the U. S. security apparatus was caught </p><p>      napping on 11 September 2001 was almost like a re- </p><p>      enactment of its Pearl Harbor humiliation by Japan </p><p>      nearly 62 years ago.  Opinions vary on the success </p><p>      or otherwise of Washington\'s Afghanistan campaign, </p><p>      especially considering that the U. S. failed in what </p><p>      was its second biggest mission: to capture, dead or </p><p>      alive, Osama bin Laden, believed to be the chief </p><p>      architect of the 11 September infamy.  But that, </p><p>      perhaps, is neither here nor there as the U. S. </p><p>      probably found sufficient consolation in its success </p><p>      in removing from power one of the most intolerant </p><p>      regimes ever to rule an Asian country.  It must have </p><p>      been that success which gave George W. Bush the idea </p><p>      that might was right and that the U. S. was </p><p>      entitled, as the world\'s only superpower, to remove </p><p>      from office any individual or regime that refused to </p><p>      do its bidding. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   "The U. S. administration\'s obsession with removing </p><p>      Saddam Hussein from power through the use of force </p><p>      smacks of that same notion - might is right.  This </p><p>      has not always been true and Bush must be quickly </p><p>      disabused of that notion.  It is a dangerous idea </p><p>      that seriously threatens world peace.  And British </p><p>      Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s strangely enthusiastic, </p><p>      almost lavish, support for that idea is deplorable, </p><p>      to say the least.  Former South African President </p><p>      Nelson Mandela may no longer be in power, but the </p><p>      fact remains that he is probably still the most </p><p>      respected opinion maker in the world.  And Mandela </p><p>      has come out openly against America\'s dangerous </p><p>      ultimatum that it will attack Iraq unless it </p><p>      satisfies itself that all plants in that country </p><p>      suspected to be used to produce weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction are dismantled.  No sane person could </p><p>      argue in favor of Iraq being allowed to produce </p><p>      those weapons, especially given Saddam\'s </p><p>      questionable judgment of events in the past. </p><p>      Nevertheless, cognizance must be taken of the real </p><p>      danger to world peace that an attack on Iraq might </p><p>      pose.  While Iraq\'s weapons production program may </p><p>      constitute a danger, real or imagined, to the U. S. </p><p>      \'s national security, it does not necessarily follow </p><p>      that it poses a danger to world peace.  On the other </p><p>      hand, if the chilling truth be told, going to war </p><p>      with Iraq does definitely endanger world peace </p><p>      because it has the potential to spark a Third World </p><p>      War.  So far, only the British government has come </p><p>      out openly in full support of Bush\'s declared </p><p>      intention to wage war against Iraq.  No other nation </p><p>      has shown much enthusiasm over the idea.  And all </p><p>      indications are that public opinion in both Britain </p><p>      and the U. S. is largely against the idea.  That </p><p>      fact alone, if nothing else, should have been </p><p>      sufficient to make both Bush and Blair reconsider </p><p>      their positions on Iraq. . .There must be other </p><p>      means, other than going to war, of ensuring that </p><p>      Iraq does not produce those weapons." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
