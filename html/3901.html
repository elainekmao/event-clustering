<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001856 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/L GEORGE WHITE </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB TINA FAULKNER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR JULIO FERNANDEZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EIND, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, CE, USAID, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  GSP CHILD LABOR UPDATE FOR SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) State 168607 </p><p>      (B) 01 Colombo 01719 </p><p>      (C) 00 Colombo 02105 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Refs (B) and (C) contain comprehensive information on </p><p>child labor in Sri Lanka.  Below is an update. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Responses keyed to Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>(a) Whether the country has adequate laws and regulations </p><p>proscribing the worst forms of child labor: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka ratified ILO convention 182 for the immediate </p><p>elimination of the worst forms of child labor on March 1, </p><p>2001.  It entered into force in March 2002.  The National </p><p>Child Protection Authority (NCPA), with the assistance of </p><p>the ILO\'s International Program on Elimination of Child </p><p>Labor (IPEC), is moving to implement the convention. </p><p> </p><p>Minimum age for employment is set at 14 years, which is </p><p>consistent with the age for completing school education. </p><p>Laws pertaining to employment of young persons between 14 </p><p>and 18 regulate health and safety of workers in this age </p><p>group.  There is no child labor or exploitation of children </p><p>within the formal or organized sector in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>The Government has proposed to increase the penalties for </p><p>violation of child labor laws. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka participates in an IPEC sub-regional program to </p><p>combat the trafficking of children for exploitative </p><p>employment.  The National Child Protection Authority, with </p><p>the assistance of the IPEC through a broad consultative </p><p>process has designed a national policy and a national plan </p><p>of action (NPA) to combat trafficking of children, the </p><p>facilitating mechanism of a wide range of the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  Sri Lankan authorities believe that </p><p>controlling child labor at its source is the most effective </p><p>way of eliminating child labor.  The NPA has been integrated </p><p>into the NCPA\'s national plan of action, but Cabinet </p><p>approval has been delayed due to the current tensions </p><p>between the President and the Cabinet of Ministers. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Government of Sri Lanka actively supports </p><p>the IPEC\'s anti trafficking programs. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka has not yet identified worst forms of child labor </p><p>existing in Sri Lanka under Section 4 of the Convention 182. </p><p>ILO/IPEC together with GSL has scheduled a strategic </p><p>planning workshop in late October 2002 to identify the worst </p><p>forms of child labor existing in Sri Lanka.  To assist this </p><p>process, a rapid assessment research is underway in four </p><p>selected geographical areas to provide insights into child </p><p>trafficking occurring in vulnerable areas.  The authorities </p><p>also hope to design a program to rescue, rehabilitate and re- </p><p>integrate children engaged in the worst forms of child </p><p>labor.  They will also design a parallel program for </p><p>prevention of the worst forms of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>B) Whether the country has adequate laws and regulations for </p><p>the implementation and enforcement of such measures: </p><p> </p><p>Minimum age for employment is set at 14 years, which is </p><p>consistent with the age for completing school education. </p><p>Penal code amendments in 1995 and 1998 - which deal with </p><p>child sex workers, pornography, trafficking of children for </p><p>sexual exploitation, employing of children to traffic in </p><p>restricted articles and causing cruelty and grievous hurt to </p><p>children - pre-date the ratification of ILO convention 182. </p><p>The Penal Code defines a child as a person under 18 years of </p><p>age in line with convention 182.  According to ILO sources, </p><p>additional laws and regulations are necessary to eliminate </p><p>the worst forms of child labor.  The Government has been </p><p>requested to amend the Penal Code, defense forces laws, and </p><p>the evidence ordinance to address these issues. </p><p> </p><p>C)    Whether the country has established formal </p><p>  institutional mechanisms to investigate and address </p><p>  complaints relating to allegations of the worst forms of </p><p>  child labor: </p><p> </p><p>Institutional mechanisms are in place to investigate </p><p>complaints regarding child labor (ref C).  The Government, </p><p>with the assistance of other organizations, is continuing to </p><p>strengthen these mechanisms.  The National Child Protection </p><p>Authority (NCPA) is the national focal point for </p><p>implementing ILO Convention 182.  NCPA legislation defines a </p><p>child as a person under 18 in line with Convention 182.  In </p><p>2001, NCPA established an anti trafficking unit that is </p><p>working to combat trafficking of children below 14, </p><p>especially in the areas of domestic labor and the sex </p><p>industry, by taking action against those who maintain the </p><p>supply chain.  On October 1, 2002 the Government established </p><p>a special unit at the NCPA to combat child abuse.  The unit </p><p>is manned by a team of 15 trained police personnel.  It will </p><p>work closely with NCPA on investigation, monitoring and </p><p>prosecution of child workers.  The NCPA also has a cyber </p><p>watch unit that scans websites for advertisements soliciting </p><p>local children.  In addition, the NCPA and the Labor </p><p>Department have continued to carry out various training </p><p>programs for judicial, labor, probation and police officers </p><p>dealing with child labor and for media personnel with the </p><p>assistance of the ILO, UNICEF, Save the Children UK and </p><p>local NGOs.  The Labor Department trained 300 officers in </p><p>2001 under ILO/IPEC program. In 2002, it hopes to train an </p><p>additional 300. </p><p> </p><p>There has been an increase in prosecutions regarding child </p><p>labor violations by the Labor Department.  The Labor </p><p>Department reported 194 complaints regarding child labor in </p><p>2000, with 79 of these cases withdrawn due to lack of </p><p>evidence or faulty complaints.  The Department prosecuted 7 </p><p>cases in 2000.  In the first eight months of 2001, the Labor </p><p>Department reported 199 complaints, with 48 cases being </p><p>withdrawn and 40 prosecuted.  (update) </p><p> </p><p>D) Whether social programs exist in the country to prevent </p><p>the engagement of children in the worst forms of child labor </p><p>and assist in the removal of children engaged in worst forms </p><p>of child labor: </p><p> </p><p>The Government hopes to eliminate child labor through </p><p>promotion of compulsory education through 14 years.   The </p><p>Government is continuing to sponsor non-formal education </p><p>units to draw non-school going children to the education </p><p>system.  A survey conducted in 1997/98 revealed that there </p><p>were about 61,000 non-school going children between the ages </p><p>of 5-14 years.  This constituted 1.4% of children in that </p><p>age group. </p><p> </p><p>NCPA has drawn its attention to assist children engaged in </p><p>worst forms of child labor.  It has established a </p><p>rehabilitation center and offers vocational training and </p><p>counseling.  NCPA also hopes to launch community empowerment </p><p>and family empowerment programs to curb trafficking and </p><p>worst forms of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>ILO is engaged in raising awareness of Trade Unions and </p><p>community leaders about the ILO conventions dealing with the </p><p>worst forms of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>UNICEF and other NGOs are working actively to raise </p><p>awareness of how to prevent sexual exploitation of children. </p><p>These programs are targeted towards both children and their </p><p>parents in high-risk areas such as beach resorts frequented </p><p>by tourists.  According to recent reports, child </p><p>prostitution is falling in Sri Lanka, at least in certain </p><p>areas.  The women and child protection unit of the Police </p><p>Department has said that open soliciting of children for sex </p><p>has declined.  The decline in child prostitution has been </p><p>attributed to awareness and publicity given to pedophile </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>E) Whether the country has a comprehensive policy for the </p><p>elimination of the worst forms of child labor: </p><p> </p><p>The Government has ratified ILO convention 182 on the </p><p>elimination of worst forms of child labor.  The Government </p><p>has designed a comprehensive policy and a national action </p><p>plan on elimination of trafficking of children for </p><p>exploitative employment, which has been integrated into the </p><p>NCPA national plan of action.  It has not been presented to </p><p>the Cabinet yet.  Post will send the final draft of the </p><p>National Policy and the National Plan of Action to </p><p>Washington agencies. </p><p> </p><p>F) Whether the country is making continual progress toward </p><p>eliminating the worst forms of child labor: </p><p>While efforts are being taken to combat child labor and </p><p>child trafficking, Sri Lanka continued to face a mounting </p><p>problem with recruitment of school children for armed </p><p>conflict by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) </p><p>through 2001 and early 2002.  Reports indicated that some </p><p>children as young as 12 years were being abducted and </p><p>recruited by the LTTE.  With the announcement of a cease- </p><p>fire in February 2002, and peace talks between the LTTE and </p><p>GSL in September 2002, there is considerable international </p><p>and domestic pressure on the LTTE to stop recruiting child </p><p>soldiers and to release child soldiers to their parents. </p><p>There are reports that this has begun to take place. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
