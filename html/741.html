AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN </p><p>ZAGREB (PROTECT) SAYS THAT CENTER DIRECTOR MAZOWIECKI, </p><p>IN THE WAKE OF HIS CHARGES THAT THERE WERE "MASS </p><p>GRAVES" IN PARTS OF SECTOR WEST, HAD TALKS WITH DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE </p><p>REMAINING DISCREPANCIES AND HOLES IN INFORMATION </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>2.  KOSTOVIC REPORTEDLY GAVE THE UNCHR THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DATA ON DETAINEES:  205 PERSONS REMAIN IN DETENTION </p><p>FROM THE SECTOR WEST OPERATION; 186 OF THESE ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES CHARGES AND THEY ARE </p><p>DISTRIBUTED AMONG FOUR DETENTION CENTERS, IN BJELOVAR, </p><p>POZEGA, OSIJEK, AND SPLIT.  AN ADDITIONAL 19 PERSONS </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02174  01 OF 02  061626Z </p><p>ARE DESCRIBED AS "FOREIGN NATIONALS" BEING CONSIDERED </p><p>AS POWS, AND THEY ARE DETAINED IN SPLIT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  KOSTOVIC SAID THE GOC HAD TURNED OVER A COMPLETE </p><p>LIST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THE CROATIAN RED CROSS. </p><p>MAZOWIECKI OBSERVED THAT THE CROATIAN RED CROSS MIGHT </p><p>NOT BE VIEWED BY SERBS AS THE MOST NEUTRAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  KOSTOVIC AGREED AND PROMISED TO PROVIDE </p><p>THE DATA ALSO TO ICRC.  THE ICRC HAS CONFIRMED TO THE </p><p>UNCHR THAT IS HAS BOTH A LIST AND/AND ACCESS TO THE </p><p>DETAINED PERSONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REGARDING THE CHARGES OF MASS GRAVES, (FYI, WE NOW </p><p>UNDERSTAND MAZOWIECKI\'S PEOPLE OBSERVED, NOT "MASS </p><p>GRAVES" AS SUCH BUT ROWS OF NEW GRAVEMOUNDS), KOSTOVIC </p><p>PROVIDED THE UNCHR A LIST OF THE BURIAL SITES WHERE A </p><p>TOTAL OF 188 FATALITIES FROM THE SECTOR WEST OPERATION </p><p>HAD BEEN BURIED.  156 OF THESE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED; 20 </p><p>WERE DEFINITELY CIVILIANS, MOST EVIDENTLY KILLED IN THE </p><p>CROSSFIRE OF A SKIRMISH NEAR NOVI VAROS.  AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>34 WERE "POSSIBLE" CIVILIANS -- THOUGHT TO BE CIVILIANS </p><p>ALTHOUGH MANY WERE DRESSED IN UNIFORMS OR PARTIAL </p><p>UNIFORMS.  KOSTOVIC REPEATED THE GOC\'S OFFER TO MAKE </p><p>INFORMATION ON THE IDENTITIES OF THE CIVILIAN DEAD </p><p>AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUAL RELATIVES WHO MIGHT INQUIRE. </p><p>HE SPECIFICALLY REJECTED THE IDEA OF PROVIDING THE </p><p>NAMES OF THE MILITARY DEAD ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE </p><p>"RSK" HAD NEVER PROVIDED SIMILAR INFORMATION AFTER THE </p><p>FIGHTING IN EASTERN SLAVONIA (VUKOVAR). </p><p>- </p><p>5. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW SAYING THERE WERE 10 SERB </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02174  01 OF 02  061626Z </p><p>WOUNDED FOUND AFTER THE OPERATION; THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>TREATED AND RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ASKED IF UN OR OTHER AUTHORITIES INTENDED TO PURSUE </p><p>THE ISSUE OF MASS GRAVES OR OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS </p><p>FURTHER, OUR SOURCE THOUGHT THIS RELATIVELY UNLIKELY. </p><p>REGARDING THE GRAVES, FM GRANIC HAD PROMISED WAR CRIMES </p><p>TRIBUNAL CHIEF PROSECUTOR GOLDSTONE DURING THE LATTER\'S </p><p>VISIT HERE THAT CROATIA WOULD COOPERATE WITH ANY </p><p>INVESTIGATION.  IT SEEMED POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>TRIBUNAL WOULD FIND INSUFFICIENT CAUSE TO PURSUE THE </p><p>MATTER FURTHER OR TO SEEK EXHUMATION.  OUR CONTACT </p><p>BELIEVED MAZOWIECKI WAS RELATIVELY SATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>EXPLANATIONS GIVEN BY THE GOC.  REGARDING THE OVERBLOWN </p><p>ESTIMATE OF KIAS GIVEN BY DEFMIN SUSAK, HE FELT THERE </p><p>WERE ENOUGH CREDIBLE SOURCES SUGGESTING THAT SUSAK HAD, </p><p>IN EFFECT, BEEN SPEAKING WITHOUT BASIS.  THE UN IN THE </p><p>BANJA LUKA AREA HAD REPORTED "SEVERAL HUNDRED" WOUNDED </p><p>AMONG THOSE WHO FLED FROM CROATIAN TO BOSNIAN </p><p>TERRITORY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ9605 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE PTQ9605 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02174  02 OF 02  061627Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  EB-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PA-01    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00    SS-00    STR-01 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00 </p><p>        /030W </p><p>                  ------------------CCE5B5  061627Z /38 </p><p>P 061712Z JUN 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6038 </p><p>INFO CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J21// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USNMR SHAPE BE//POLAD// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>WHITEHOUSE WASHDC </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02174  02 OF 02  061627Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 002174 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>BAKU FOR FINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOC OFFERS MORE DETAIL ON SECTOR WEST KIA, </p><p>          GRAVES, DETAINEES </p><p> </p><p>IN THE FIRST DAY OF THE ASSAULT, SO THAT THE FIGURE OF </p><p>ONLY 10 WIA REMAINING ON THE CROATIAN SIDE COULD WELL </p><p>BE CORRECT. </p><p> </p><p>7.
