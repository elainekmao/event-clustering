(C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD CALLED ON MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA ON APRIL 14 TO ASK WHETHER FOREIGN OBSERVERS </p><p>WOULD BE WELCOME DURING THE GENERAL PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE JUSTICE MINISTER SAID THAT ALTHOUGH </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN SOME DESENTING VOICES, FOREIGN OBSERVERS </p><p>ARE WELCOME TO COME TO ZIMBABWE, AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR </p><p>EVERY ELECTION SINCE 1980.  THERE IS NO CHANGE IN </p><p>POLICY, THE MINISTER AFFIRMED.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THEN </p><p>ASKED FOR A WRITTEN INVITATION, BUT MNANGAGWA SAID THAT </p><p>ONE WOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID HE WOULD PROPOSE TO PRESIDENT MUGABE TO </p><p>ISSUE AN ORAL INVITATION TO FOREIGN OBSERVERS WHEN HE </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE ELECTION DATE.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKED THE </p><p>MINISTER, AND SAID THAT HE HOPED THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF </p><p>THE OBSERVERS, BECAUSE IMAGES FLASHED AROUND THE WORLD </p><p>OF VIOLENCE IN HARARE AND ON THE FARMS HAD RAISED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02101  01 OF 02  141206Z </p><p>CONCERN IN WASHINGTON.

THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID THE ISSUE HAS YET TO BE RESOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TURNING TO MATTERS RELATING TO THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>IN THE CONGO, THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED MNANGAGWA OF </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE\'S TRAVEL PLANS.  THE MINISTER </p><p>AGREED TO RECEIVE WOLPE, TENTATIVELY THE AFTERNOON OF </p><p>APRIL 21.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO ASKED MNANGAGWA TO STRESS </p><p>TO PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO </p><p>RECEIVE S/E WOLPE.  THE MINISTER AGREED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, </p><p>MNANGAGWA SAID HE PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO KINSHASA ON APRIL </p><p>17, AT PRESIDENT KABILA\'S INVITATION.  HE BEGGED OFF </p><p>TRAVELING IMMEDIATELY, AS HE WISHED TO BE BRIEFED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO ONLY RETURNS TO HARARE ON APRIL </p><p>16, REGARDING WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE SUMMIT IN </p><p>KINSHASA.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES LOOKED TO ZIMBABWE TO EXERCISE ALL OF ITS </p><p>INFLUENCE WITH PRESIDENT KABILA TO ADHERE TO THE LETTER </p><p>AND SPIRIT OF THE LUSAKA ACCORD, THE MINISTER SAID THAT </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN NATIONAL ARMY COMMANDER HAD BEEN SENT TO </p><p>KINSHASA LAST WEEK TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FAC\'S CEASE </p><p>FIRE VIOLATIONS.  KABILA TOLD THE SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02101  01 OF 02  141206Z </p><p>MILITARY OFFICIAL THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY SUCH </p><p>VIOLATIONS, BUT ALLOWED THAT HIS COMMANDERS SOMETIMES DO </p><p>THINGS WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE.  HE SUMMONED </p><p>SEVERAL SENIOR CONGOLESE MILITARY OFFICERS TO HIS OFFICE </p><p>TO HEAR THE ZIMBABWEAN ARMY COMMANDER\'S COMPLAINT. </p><p>KABILA INSTRUCTED HIS OFFICERS HENCEFORTH TO CLEAR ALL </p><p>MANEUVERS WITH THE ALLIES AND STRESSED HIS </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THEY HAD NOT DONE SO.  THE </p><p>CONGOLESE, MNANGAGWA SHRUGGED, SAY "YES", AND THEN DO </p><p>SOMETHING ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>5.

MNANGAGWA OBSERVED THAT THE BELGIUMS WERE </p><p>USING GEORGE FORRESTER, CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION MINIERE, </p><p>TO GET CLOSE TO KABILA.  THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER NOTED </p><p>THAT KABILA\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE UNITED STATES HAD </p><p>CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOLLOWING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6352 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02101  02 OF 02  141206Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    USIE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------4BC911  141207Z /38 </p><p>R 141211Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5768 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF A/S RICE, AF PDAS POWELL, </p><p>AF DAS SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, </p><p>AND AF/S DESK OFFICER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USAID AFR/SA, WJEFFERS AND A/AID, RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02101  02 OF 02  141206Z </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: MNANGAGWA SAYS FOREIGN ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>WELCOME AND REVIEWS STATUS IN CONGO </p><p> </p><p>HIS VISIT TO NEW YORK IN JANUARY.
