<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 25: TEMPORARY RESPITE ON </p><p>NEWS OF US AID PROPOSAL; CONCERN ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>LIQUIDITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1905 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Stabilize for Now </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Turkish markets at OOB March 25 were positively </p><p>affected by press reports that the US Administration was </p><p>seeking Congressional approval of $1 billion in aid as part </p><p>of the war supplemental.  As a result, the steady </p><p>deterioration in Turkish markets of the last four days </p><p>appears to have stabilized.  However, traders told us that </p><p>concerns about the April 9 $3 billion redemption in the local </p><p>T-bill markets continue to dominate market sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Yields at close of the morning trading session on Turkish </p><p>lira T-bills were 72 percent compounded, stronger than </p><p>yesterday\'s close (73.5 percent), but weaker than yesterday\'s </p><p>opening (69 percent). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira appreciated in early trading on the US news, but </p><p>continuing dollar demand this morning from Turkish banks (see </p><p>para 5 below) lead to renewed deprecation.  The lira is </p><p>currently trading at TL 1,750,000 to the dollar, unchanged </p><p>form yesterday\'s close. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange closed up 2 percent, with </p><p>some traders selling into the market upturn. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Statement on Fiscal Tightening Largely Ignored </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) GOT spokesman Cemil Cicek\'s March 24 statement </p><p>(reftel) outlines TL 4 quadrillion of new fiscal measures, </p><p>intended to respond to heightened debt roll-over concerns. </p><p>The statement didn\'t provide details on the measures, and </p><p>market players told us late March 24 and March 25 am that the </p><p>statement had no impact on the markets.  "We will look to </p><p>implementation," summed up JP Morgan/Chase bond trader </p><p>Gumisdis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The economic portions of the March 24 statement </p><p>follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The Cabinet decided to take additional measures to </p><p>prevent the impact of negative developments that might be </p><p>caused by the war.  We will block certain non-interest </p><p>expenditures already allocated in the draft budget.  This </p><p>will lead to TL 4 quadrillion of savings, about 1 percent of </p><p>GNP." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The GOT will implement a tight cash management policy </p><p>focusing only on obligatory expenditures such as public </p><p>sector wages, defense expenditures and debt payments.  There </p><p>will be no tax amnesty or debt restructuring." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "We will annul the Cabinet decrees of 1996 and 2001 which </p><p>prevent the forced retirement of public sector workers, and </p><p>State Economic Enterprise boards will be instructed to </p><p>resolve the retirement and redundant position issues. </p><p>TEKEL\'s privatization plan will be submitted to the High </p><p>Privatization Council in a short time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The IMF doesn\'t yet have the details of the planned </p><p>TL 4 quadrillion in new fiscal savings, per IMF resrep.  He </p><p>believes the measures are not actually "savings," but rather </p><p>temporary delays of expenditures such as public investment </p><p>projects, designed to generate cash now, with an eye towards </p><p>the Treasury\'s April 9 and May 21 debt redemptions.  Resrep </p><p>will meet with MinState Babacan on evening of March 25 to </p><p>discuss a work plan for finalizing the LOI and the Fourth </p><p>Review prior actions.   Resrep will brief us on March 26. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Continuing Concerns with Lack of Foreign Currency Liquidity </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The latest vulnerability in Turkish banks lies in </p><p>the declining value of their Turkish Eurobond holdings, </p><p>following a large-scale foreign investor sell-off in this </p><p>market.  Turkish banks need such foreign exchange assets to </p><p>match their foreign exchange deposits (at least 55 percent of </p><p>Turkish bank deposits are in F/X).  According to Barclay\'s </p><p>Bank trader Matt Vogel, Turkish banks are currently borrowing </p><p>an estimated $3 billion from foreign banks in short-term </p><p>"repo" transactions (which use Turkish Eurobonds as </p><p>collateral, and have an average loan maturity of 3 months). </p><p>Vogel\'s estimate is based on demand by Turkish banks for </p><p>repos loans with Barclay\'s, and Barclay\'s requirement that </p><p>such banks disclose their other outstanding repo borrowing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The vulnerability lies in the sharply declining </p><p>value of these loans\' collateral, the Turkish Eurobond, which </p><p>has lost about 10 percent of its value in past week and </p><p>nearly 20 percent in past month.  This decline has triggered </p><p>margin calls among some repo lenders, which Vogel estimates </p><p>to total about $300 million.  Thus, he told us, Disbank (a </p><p>medium size bank without a large deposit base) has been </p><p>buying dollars to meet margin calls.   Vogel speculates that </p><p>Isbank is doing the same. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  Turkish banks\' $3 billion exposure in the </p><p>Eurobond repo market is not technically a "foreign exchange </p><p>open position" because Turkish banks are not generally using </p><p>these loans to buy lira T-bills, but rather to fund their </p><p>Eurobond investments.  Thus the banks are not technically </p><p>"short" F/X because they have F/X denominated Eurobonds. </p><p>But the problem is their Turkish Eurobonds are losing value </p><p>(despite a slight increase today), and this will directly </p><p>affect their ability to roll-over F/X-denominated debt in the </p><p>local market in June.  We are seeking the June local debt </p><p>redemption dates and amounts and will provide septel. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
