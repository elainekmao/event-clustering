End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. On July 25, the Sri Lankan Parliament approved a long- </p><p>anticipated IPR law by a vote of 99-59. It will come into </p><p>effect when the Speaker of the Parliament signs the bill, </p><p>currently expected to happen in August.  Passage was </p><p>delayed approximately two months by a court case, which </p><p>resulted in amendments to allow compulsory licensing and </p><p>parallel imports.  These amendments were required by the </p><p>Supreme Court, which ruled that certain provisions in the </p><p>bill on patents were inconsistent with the Constitution </p><p>and violated fundamental rights of the people of Sri </p><p>Lanka.  The petitioners, an AIDS activist and a think- </p><p>tank, stated that the bill allowed patent owners, </p><p>especially pharmaceutical companies, to control the </p><p>supply and prices of drugs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Parliamentary debate on the bill lasted two days.  On </p><p>the first day, several Members of Parliament, including </p><p>opposition members, generally spoke in favor of the bill, </p><p>stressing the need to protect copyrights, especially of </p><p>local artists.  On the last day of the vote, however, the </p><p>opposition members of the People\'s Alliance and JVP </p><p>opposed the bill, saying the bill should be re-published </p><p>and presented for public comment again before </p><p>parliamentary approval.  The opposition claimed the </p><p>government was introducing several last minute changes, </p><p>and alleged that the GSL was not carrying out the Supreme </p><p>Court directions properly. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Government maintained that it was amending only </p><p>the clauses suggested by the Court and there was no need </p><p>for further delays.  According to the Director General of </p><p>Intellectual Property of Sri Lanka, Dr. D.M. Karunaratne, </p><p>the Attorney General had approved the amendments to the </p><p>legislation, in accordance with the Court ruling. </p><p>Karunaratne believes the opposition members did not fully </p><p>understand the legal changes made in the bill. </p><p>Government officials and other critics blame the </p><p>opposition reaction on divisive politics rather than on </p><p>any technical or legal grounds. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The new IPR law is WTO TRIPS compliant.  It protects </p><p>and governs copyrights of artistic, literary and </p><p>scientific work, related rights, industrial designs, </p><p>patents, marks and trade names, layout designs of </p><p>integrated circuits, unfair competition, undisclosed </p><p>information and geographical information.  The </p><p>preparation of the new law took years, under several </p><p>governments, and was actively promoted by the Embassy and </p><p>official USG visitors (see reftels).  Several US parties, </p><p>including USAID consultants and the Motion Picture </p><p>Association of America (MPAA), reviewed the draft law and </p><p>provided comments.  Sri Lanka still needs to ratify and </p><p>conform to the recent WIPO Performances and Phonograms </p><p>Treaty (WPPT) and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). </p><p>According to Dr. Karunaratne, certain provisions in the </p><p>new law, such as communication to the public, conform to </p><p>some provisions in these treaties, but not all. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The new law provides for an improved enforcement </p><p>mechanism.  Currently, enforcement is a serious problem </p><p>as is the lack of public awareness of IPR.  The </p><p>Government does not act as an enforcer of IPR laws, </p><p>partially due to weaknesses in the existing law.  For </p><p>example, under copyrights, the previous law covered only </p><p>the reproduction of works, not the sale, rental or export </p><p>of counterfeits.  The new IPR law brings copyright law up </p><p>to WTO and Bern Convention requirements, with expanded </p><p>relief including powers to impound or destroy copies, </p><p>packaging and implements used for making copies, and </p><p>enhanced fines.  It also brings amendments to the Customs </p><p>Ordinance, allowing Customs to detect import and export </p><p>of counterfeit products, which will now be prohibited. </p><p>At present, aggrieved parties must, on their own, seek </p><p>redress of any IPR violation through the courts, often a </p><p>slow process. </p><p>7.  Local agents of reputed US and other international </p><p>recording, software development and motion picture </p><p>companies continue to complain that lack of IPR </p><p>protection is damaging their businesses.  The Embassy, </p><p>along with key industry players including the IFPI, </p><p>continues to lobby for improvements in Sri Lanka\'s IPR </p><p>regime.  The Embassy has convened a group of US companies </p><p>adversely affected by IPR violations to engage the </p><p>government on enforcement and to enhance public </p><p>awareness. </p><p> </p><p>Entwistle </p><p></p></div>
