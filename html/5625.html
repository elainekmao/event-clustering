<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, MARR, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: MANAGING A NEW IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Frank C. Urbancic for Reason 1.5 D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  During a private dinner with two prominent </p><p>Kuwaiti businessmen -- one Islamist, the other liberal -- the </p><p>topic of conversation centered on doing business in </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq.  This pair of 40-something </p><p>movers-and-shakers was extremely interested to know who will </p><p>run economic and commercial affairs in the immediate </p><p>aftermath of a regime change, as they position themselves and </p><p>their family enterprises for potential windfalls.  They both </p><p>hoped that whatever management structure is put in place, it </p><p>is done so quickly, transparently, and in a manner that does </p><p>not unfairly benefit any single country (namely the United </p><p>States).  Their interests and concerns might be seen as a </p><p>barometer for the thinking of a larger segment of </p><p>well-established, trade-minded Kuwaitis at this time.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE DINNER GUESTS: EconOff met February 1, 2003, at </p><p>the luxurious home of Faisal al-Zamel, an Islamist Kuwaiti </p><p>businessman and investor in his mid-40s, who received an MBA </p><p>from the University of Connecticut, specializing in banking. </p><p>Al-Zamel is a board member of the Arabi Holding Group, an </p><p>international shareholding company, and chairman and general </p><p>manager of several Kuwaiti firms.  He is affiliated with the </p><p>Kuwait Finance House, Kuwait\'s lone Islamic bank, and writes </p><p>a regular column for Al-Watan newspaper with a decidedly </p><p>Islamist bent.  The Al-Zamel family is extensive throughout </p><p>the Gulf, especially in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, where </p><p>Al-Zamel Industries does large-scale business in oil, real </p><p>estate, construction, and other ventures. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Joining Al-Zamal as dinner guest was Loay Jassem </p><p>al-Khorafi, son of Kuwaiti\'s Speaker of Parliament Jassem </p><p>al-Khorafi, and a member of one of the more influential </p><p>business families in Kuwait.  Among its multi-billion dollar </p><p>global interests, the al-Khorafi Group operates the Kuwait </p><p>Food Company (of which Loay is a board member), the Mars Alam </p><p>International Airport in Egypt, and is opening a Four Seasons </p><p>Hotel in Syria.  Loay al-Khorafi is chairman and managing </p><p>director of Kuwait Metal Pipe and Oil Service Company, a </p><p>manufacturing venture he hopes will be doing business soon </p><p>in, as he puts it, "new Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) TABLE TALK: The question of who will manage </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq lies front and center in the minds of </p><p>al-Zamel, al-Khorafi, and the Kuwaitis they routinely speak </p><p>to during their daily affairs and in their nightly forays to </p><p>diwaniyas (informal gatherings of Kuwaiti men).  Over fresh </p><p>fish and kababs, Al-Zamel relayed how he had heard on the </p><p>diwaniya circuit a plan being hatched in which the US will </p><p>manage military and security operations, while Britain </p><p>manages civilian aspects of a new Iraq.  If true, he thought </p><p>the British were well suited for this role, as they have a </p><p>long history in the region, seem to comprehend the culture, </p><p>and are respected for their ability to have run governments </p><p>and civil societies far better than the Ottoman Turks.  He </p><p>added that there was much the USG could learn from British </p><p>rule in the Middle East, but was afraid, as were many of his </p><p>compatriots, that American leaders do not understand the </p><p>region and will make similar mistakes to those made in Iran, </p><p>Afghanistan, and other countries that came under American </p><p>influence. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Al-Zamel\'s historical commentary served as a prelude </p><p>to the crux of the dinner conversation: concern over the </p><p>management entity that will run post-Saddam Iraq.  Al-Khorafi </p><p>said he desires doing business there, but only if he feels </p><p>secure with those in power.  This notion rules out any Iraqi </p><p>entity, which he said could not be trusted to uphold a </p><p>contract.  Al-Khorafi pointed out how throughout its history </p><p>Iraq has depended on a series of dictators to hold its ethnic </p><p>and religious factions in check, yet there was presently no </p><p>individual on the horizon capable of running the country. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) His question, then, was who would manage Iraq.  The </p><p>US?  Britain?  The UN?  He stressed that it was critical for </p><p>there to be a management structure in place and publicly </p><p>known immediately after the turnover of power.  Otherwise, he </p><p>feared confusion would ensue, with the potential for </p><p>political and economic chaos.  Further, he and his associates </p><p>fear that should a US-led structure prevail, business tenders </p><p>would naturally favor American companies.  For this reason, </p><p>Al-Khorafi would prefer to see a UN-led coalition remove </p><p>Saddam, rather than unilateral action by the US, which might </p><p>usher in American domination of Iraq.  (NOTE: Several months </p><p>ago, al-Khorafi publicly blamed the USG of meddling in </p><p>Kuwaiti business affairs after a US company was awarded a </p><p>tender his own company had sought, only to later apologize </p><p>for the accusation.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The two Kuwaitis said that a decision should be made </p><p>now on who will manage economic and commercial affairs in </p><p>Iraq, but agreed that it would be difficult for the US or the </p><p>UN to do so, as this would make it appear like Saddam\'s </p><p>removal was a fait accompli.  They hoped that such </p><p>discussions were being conducted behind closed doors. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Al-Khorafi said that Kuwaiti businessmen were starting </p><p>to feel hampered by the uncertainty caused from the threat of </p><p>warfare to the north.  He said that just that day the Kuwaiti </p><p>stock market, which has continued to prosper throughout the </p><p>global market crisis, suffered its largest single-day drop. </p><p>(NOTE: The local stock exchange did plummet 89.3 points </p><p>February 1, coinciding with the announcement by Kuwait\'s </p><p>Deputy Premier and Interior Minister Shaykh Mohammed </p><p>Al-Khaled Al Sabah that the country was increasing its alert </p><p>status and placing 4,000 fully-armed special forces on </p><p>Kuwaiti streets, as well as with President Bush\'s statement </p><p>that conflict could occur in "weeks, not months.")  Al-Zamel </p><p>added that during his visits to diwaniyas he had been hearing </p><p>Kuwaitis say they were exchanging  dinars for dollars as a </p><p>cautionary move. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) JUST DESSERT: Over sweets and Arabic coffee, </p><p>Al-Khorafi said he does not believe there will be armed </p><p>conflict in Iraq, but rather a coup led by one or more </p><p>members of Saddam\'s inner circle.  (NOTE: His father the </p><p>Speaker has expressed this same view.  END NOTE.)  When </p><p>confronted with the choice of being killed by invading forces </p><p>or dying at the hands of Saddam for trying to flee the </p><p>country, al-Khorafi thought that at least one of his deputies </p><p>would decide instead to assassinate Saddam and beg for mercy </p><p>from the international community.  Al-Khorafi added that he </p><p>had heard wealthy Iraqis were looking for ways to move their </p><p>money out of the country, where they or their families might </p><p>later retrieve the wealth. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Even if Saddam is removed in this manner, an </p><p>international entity must still enter the country and </p><p>establish a new government, al-Khorafi said.  Returning to </p><p>his point that no one person can rule Iraq, he thought that a </p><p>partition of the country was inevitable.  He wondered aloud, </p><p>however, how the southern section of Iraq would be permitted </p><p>to form its own nation state, since the center and northern </p><p>sections would not want to forfeit the rich southern oil </p><p>fields, plus Iran would not accept a new oil-rich and </p><p>Shia-dominated country on its border. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Both al-Zamel and al-Khorafi said that Iran is the </p><p>key to the region.  They suggested that the USG needs to use </p><p>both "carrots" and "sticks" to keep Iran in check.  A useful </p><p>"carrot" was the promise of economic aid, should Iran reform </p><p>politically.  A useful "stick" was threatening Iraq\'s </p><p>partition, a scenario Iran was firmly against. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) COMMENT: While these remarks directly reflect the </p><p>opinions of just two Kuwaiti businessmen, they can also be </p><p>seen as incorporating a much wider view held by an extremely </p><p>influential segment of society; if not forming a consensus, </p><p>these ideas at least frame a serious debate now taking place </p><p>in the country.  Given their proximity to Iraq and their </p><p>previously well-established network of economic ties to that </p><p>country, Kuwaitis are especially keen to learn the shape </p><p>their northern neighbor will take under a new regime.  The </p><p>more transparent the process, and the more Kuwait feels it is </p><p>being treated by America as a partner rather than merely a </p><p>stepping stone, the more likely its support and goodwill are </p><p>apt to endure.  We note the irony of (Kuwaiti) Arabs (a) </p><p>dismissing the prospect of any Iraqi entity being able to </p><p>rule Iraq effectively, and (b) assuming partition is </p><p>inevitable; but living with contradiction, ambiguity, and </p><p>uncertainty is a Kuwaiti hallmark. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
