<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000343 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA, AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREAUSRY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p>USDOC FOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, ENRG, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT ANNOUNCES 2003 PRIVATIZATION </p><p>PROGRAM - A GOOD STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SENER </p><p>ANNOUNCED JANUARY 13 THE 2003 PRIVATIZATION </p><p>PROGRAM, ADOPTED EARLIER BY THE HIGHER </p><p>PRIVATIZATION COUNCIL.  IT SETS AN AMBITIOUS </p><p>TARGET OF $4 BILLION IN PRIVATIZATION REVENUE. </p><p>IT INCLUDES FOUR MAJOR STATE ENTERPRISES - </p><p>PETKIM (PETROCHEMICALS), TEKEL (TOBACCO AND </p><p>ALCOHOL), TURKISH AIRLINES, AND TUPRAS (OIL </p><p>REFINING), AND DOZENS OF SMALL FERTILIZER, </p><p>TEXTILE, MACHINERY PLANTS AND OTHER STATE </p><p>ASSETS.   THE DETAILED PLAN TO SELL OFF TEKEL </p><p>SHOULD MEET A IMF PRIOR ACTION, AND THE PLAN </p><p>SHOULD ALSO IMPRESS THE MARKETS.  THE CHALLENGE </p><p>WILL BE TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND SELL OFF THESE </p><p>COMPANIES EVEN IF MARKET VALUATIONS COME IN </p><p>UNDER GOT EXPECTATIONS, AND DESPITE PUBLIC </p><p>SECTOR UNION CONCERNS WITH LAY-OFFS (SENER </p><p>ADDRESSED THE LATTER IN HIS STATEMENT).   AK </p><p>LEADERSHIP HAS CONSISTENTLY TOLD US THEY WOULD </p><p>ACCELERATE PRIVATIZATION.  IMPLEMENTING THIS </p><p>PROGRAM, WHICH WE WILL MONITOR CLOSELY, WOULD </p><p>ACCOMPLISH THAT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SENER ANNOUNCED THE GOT\'S </p><p>DETAILED PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM FOR 2003 ON JANUARY 13. </p><p>THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE HIGHER </p><p>PRIVATIZATION COUNCIL (A SUB-SET OF THE FULL CABINET, </p><p>IT HAS THE TURKISH ACRONYM OYK).  THE GOT AIMS TO </p><p>REALIZE $4 BILLION IN PRIVATIZATION REVENUE IN 2003. </p><p>SENER STATED THIS WOULD AFFECT A TOTAL OF 64,000 PEOPLE </p><p>WORKING IN THE STATE-OWNED COMPANIES.  HE SAID "PEOPLE </p><p>AFFECTED BY THE PRIVATIZATIONS WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF" </p><p>(MEANING PROBABLY THE WORLD BANK-FUNDED $250 MILLION </p><p>FACILITY TO PAY SEVERANCE PACKAGES.)  PRIVATIZATION </p><p>ADMINISTRATION (PA) DEPUTY CHAIRMAN HIDAYAT KAYA TOLD </p><p>US THE PA PLANS TO LAY OFF 10,000 WORKERS IN TEKEL </p><p>PRIOR TO ITS JUNE 2003 TENDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE 2003 PRIVATIZATION CALENDAR ANNOUNCED BY SENER </p><p>IS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FIRST QUARTER 2003: </p><p>THE MAJOR PRIVATIZATION IS THE TENDER FOR PRIVATIZATION </p><p>OF PETKIM (STATE PETROCHEMICAL GIANT), VIA BLOCK SALE </p><p>OF A MINIMUM 51 PERCENT. </p><p>OTHER PRIVATIZATIONS INCLUDE THE GERKONSAN STEEL PLANT; </p><p>THE TAKSAN MACHINE TOOLS PLANT; ADAPAZARI FACILITY OF </p><p>TURKISH AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT ORGANIZATION; SEKA PAPER </p><p>PLANTS IN AKDENIZ, AKSU, BALIKESIR, CAYCUMA PLANTS; THE </p><p>ETI SILVER AND METALLURGICAL PLANTS (ALL VIA EITHER </p><p>BLOCK SALE OF SHARES OR ASSET SALES). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECOND QUARTER 2003: </p><p>THE TWO MAJOR PRIVATIZATIONS ARE THE TENDER OF THE </p><p>GOT\'S 66 PERCENT SHARE OF TUPRAS (STATE OIL REFINING </p><p>MONOPOLY), AND TEKEL (TOBACCO, ALCOHOL AND SALT GIANT </p><p>TO BE SPLIT INTO THREE CONSTITUENT PARTS AND TENDERED </p><p>IN JUNE). </p><p>SMALLER PRIVATIZATIONS ARE SUMER HOLDING\'S TEXTILE AND </p><p>LEATHER PLANTS IN DIYARBAKIR, ADIYAMAN, CANAKKALE </p><p>LEATHER, VAN, TERCAN AND AKDENIZ; THE GEMLIK, SAMSUN </p><p>AND KUTAHYA FERTILIZER PLANTS (EITHER VIA BLOCK SALE OF </p><p>SHARES OR ASSET SALES). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECOND HALF 2003: </p><p>THE MAJOR PRIVATIZATION IS A TENDER FOR TURKISH </p><p>AIRLINES, VIA BLOCK SALE OR PUBLIC OFFERING. </p><p>OTHER PRIVATIZATIONS INCLUDE A SMALL PORT CALLED TASUCU </p><p>(VIA ASSET SALE OR TRANSFER OF OPERATING RIGHTS; THE </p><p>BLACK SEA COPPER FACILITIES;  ETI COPPER; SEKA PAPER </p><p>COMPANY IN IZMIR; SUMER HOLDING\'S TEXTILE PLANTS IN </p><p>MERINOS, BAKIRKOY, BEYKOZ, ANTALYA, BERGAMA AND MANISA; </p><p>AND ATAKOY HOTELS AND MARINA IN ISTANBUL.  THESE </p><p>SMALLER SALES CAN BE VIA EITHER BLOCK SALE OF SHARES OR </p><p>ASSET SALES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) SENER ALSO ANNOUNCED PLANS EITHER TO OUTRIGHT </p><p>PRIVATIZE OR TRANSFER TO THE PRIVATIZATION </p><p>ADMINISTRATION SEVERAL OTHER STATE-OWNED COMPANIES: </p><p>--  THE SUGAR BEET REFINERIES (THERE ARE 27 OF THEM </p><p>SCATTERED THROUGHOUT TURKEY) WILL BE PRIVATIZED THROUGH </p><p>A SEPARATE OYK DECISION (REQUIRES COORDINATING WITH THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY); </p><p>--  THE ISTANBUL STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>LOTTERY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE PA FOR EVENTUAL </p><p>PRIVATIZATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) PA CHAIRMAN TURGUT BOZKURT ALSO MADE REMARKS </p><p>FOLLOWING DPM SENER\'S PRESENATION.  BOZKURT SAID THE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING OF HALKBANK WAS COMPLETE (HALK IS ONE OF </p><p>TWO LARGE STATE-OWNED BANKS AND UNDER THE STATE BANK </p><p>LAW MUST BE PRIVATIZED BEFORE YEAR-END 2004.)  BOZKURT </p><p>SAID HE PLANS TO INCLUDE IT IN THE 2003 PRIVATIZATION </p><p>PROGRAM SOON.  BOZKURT ADDED THAT THE TURK TELEKOM </p><p>TENDER COMMISSION IS CONTINUING THE VALUATION PROCESS, </p><p>TO BE FOLLOWED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PRIVATIZATION </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) TWO MISSING ELEMENTS IN THE PRIVATIZATION </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT WERE ENERGY AND STEEL.  PA DEPUTY HALUK </p><p>BUYUKBAS TOLD US THAT ENERGY PRIVATIZATION IS INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE COMPLETE OYK DECISION (WE ARE SEEKING A COPY) </p><p>BUT WITHOUT DEADLINES.  ON STEEL, BUYUKBAS SAID THE PA </p><p>PREFERS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER OF STATE-OWNED ISDEMIR </p><p>INTO ERDEMIR BEFORE SELLING OFF THE COMBINED COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) THIS IS AN EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS PRIVATIZATION </p><p>PROGRAM (COMPARE WITH PRIVATIZATION PROCEEDS IN 2002 OF </p><p>ABOUT $500 MILLION), AND THE DETAILED TEKEL PLAN SHOULD </p><p>MEET A PRIOR ACTION UNDER THE IMF FOURTH REVIEW.  ITS </p><p>TARGET OF RAISING $4 BILLION WILL DEPEND ON MARKET </p><p>VALUATIONS.  ONE CHALLENGE FOR THE GOT WILL BE TO SELL </p><p>OFF THESE COMPANIES EVEN IF MARKET VALUATIONS COME IN </p><p>UNDER EXPECTATIONS.  THE OTHER MAJOR CHALLENGE IS TO </p><p>DEAL WITH THE POLITICAL FALL-OUT FROM LAY-OFFS AT STATE- </p><p>OWNED COMPANIES, WHICH SENER REFERRED TO IN HIS </p><p>STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPRESSIVE PROGRAM </p><p>WOULD BE A KEY STRUCTURAL REFORM VICTORY, THOUGH WE </p><p>SHOULD NOT ENCOURAGE THE GOT TO VIEW IT AS A FISCAL </p><p>POLICY SOLUTION, WHICH AK LEADERS HAVE A TENDENCY TO </p><p>DO.  OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, GOT PRIVATIZATION EFFORTS </p><p>HABEEN LONG ON RHETORIC AND SHORT ON ACTION.  WE WILL </p><p>CLOSELY MONITOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS </p><p>PROGRAM, AND PUSH WHENEVER NECESSARY.    PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
