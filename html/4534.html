<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ASEC, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AQABA PIZZA HUT FIRE AN ACCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Econoff spoke to Arab Food Catering Company owner </p><p>Khaled Dhaleh November 27 to check on press reports about a </p><p>"suspicious" fire in a Pizza Hut in Aqaba.  Dhaleh, whose </p><p>company owns the Pizza Hut, Burger King, and Popeyes </p><p>restaurants in Jordan, said the November 25th fire was caused </p><p>by a short circuit in a refrigerator.  (A number of press </p><p>reports claimed the cause of the fire was arson rooted in </p><p>anti-Americanism, and portrayed the incident as one of a </p><p>series of attacks on American fast food restaurants </p><p>throughout the region.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Dhaleh told us the fire began at about noon, when a </p><p>short circuit in a basement refrigerator ignited a fire with </p><p>packaged material within.  The fire smoldered slowly, </p><p>damaging the refrigerator and part of the building, but was </p><p>quickly brought under control and caused no injuries.  He </p><p>said that damages were in the range of about $15,000, and </p><p>that the restaurant would be reopened December 2. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Dhaleh said he heard initial news reports on the </p><p>radio at midnight the same day that reported arson as the </p><p>cause.  He said that it seemed to be a case of "wishful </p><p>thinking" on the part of the press, "some of whom wanted a </p><p>story and some of whom wanted to celebrate".  Dhaleh added </p><p>that he had experienced no recent bouts of anti-Americanism </p><p>in any of his restaurants, and that business was "okay". </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) This report corroborates the Ambassador\'s </p><p>conversation with the son of the owner of the hotel in which </p><p>the Pizza Hut is located.  The son, a friend, also said it </p><p>was an electrical fire. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
