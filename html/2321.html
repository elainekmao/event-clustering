<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003227 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, EPET, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: U.S.-U.K. TEAM RAISES VOLUNTARY </p><p>PRINCIPLES ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY WITH OIL COMPANIES </p><p>AND GON </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: A joint delegation from the British Foreign </p><p>Office and the State Department met Nigerian government </p><p>officials and oil company representatives from November 26-28 </p><p>in Lagos and Abuja to discuss implementation in Nigeria of </p><p>the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.  HMG, </p><p>the USG, seven U.S. and U.K. oil and mining companies, and a </p><p>number of human rights groups had signed the Principles in </p><p>Washington on December 20, 2000.  GON officials welcomed the </p><p>Principles as an effort to support the rule of law and human </p><p>rights in the Niger Delta.  Meetings with companies resulted </p><p>in suggestions to hold an in-country working-level security </p><p>meeting, a NGO meeting in Lagos, and presentation of the </p><p>Principles to the Niger Delta Security Committee (NDSC) and </p><p>the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Initial misunderstandings of the purpose of the </p><p>delegation\'s visit and nature of the Voluntary Principles by </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigerian National </p><p>Police brought into focus the great sensitivity surrounding </p><p>politics and security in the Delta Region. For progress in </p><p>implementation of the Principles, continuing communication </p><p>with and among the oil companies and the GON is necessary. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) The joint delegation consisted of Maria Pica, Bureau of </p><p>Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Department of State; </p><p>Christopher Camponovo, Office of the Legal Adviser/Human </p><p>Rights, Department of State; Gregor Lusty, Head of Global </p><p>Citizenship Unit, Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and Andrew </p><p>Woodcock, Global Citizenship Unit, Foreign and Commonwealth </p><p>Office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Assistance from the Foreign Ministry </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On Monday, November 26, the group met with M.G. </p><p>Omotosho, Minister Counselor of the Legal and Treaties </p><p>Division and members of the Legal and Consular Bureau of the </p><p>Foreign Ministry.  After the briefing on the Voluntary </p><p>Principles, Mr. Omotosho said the Foreign Ministry would </p><p>support the Principles which he saw as promoting human rights </p><p>and the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Omotosho asked whether the Niger Delta Development </p><p>Corporation (NDDC), a government-industry funded development </p><p>foundation, was involved.  He suggested the delegation meet </p><p>with the Department of Petroleum Resources rather than the </p><p>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  The </p><p>delegation stressed that their meetings were solely to inform </p><p>the GON about the initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Omotosho mentioned that there was a great deal of </p><p>sensitivity about the petroleum industry, security and the </p><p>Niger Delta.  The delegation understood this as an oblique </p><p>reference to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dubem </p><p>Onyia\'s calling in Ambassador Jeter and British DCM Charles </p><p>Bird separately on November 23 to protest scheduling meetings </p><p>for the delegation with State Governors.  After the purpose </p><p>of the meetings was explained, the Minister still insisted </p><p>they be cancelled because they had been scheduled without his </p><p>Ministry\'s approval, "in violation of Nigeria\'s sovereignty." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The Protocol Office of the Foreign Ministry </p><p>was involved in the visit from the outset and had received a </p><p>copy of the delegation\'s schedule.  The MFA Protocol </p><p>Counselor seemed unaware that the Minister of State would </p><p>protest the meetings with Governors.  The Counselor also </p><p>seemed confused that the rules of the game had changed for </p><p>this delegation --Embassies had never been required to get </p><p>permission to speak to Governors before nor be accompanied at </p><p>all times on their calls, as Omotosho requested during the </p><p>meeting. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) With an MFA Treaty Division official in tow, the </p><p>delegation met Funsho Kupolokun, Special Assistant to the </p><p>President on Petroleum Matters and the NNPC\'s Group General </p><p>Manager for Corporate Planning and Development J.T. Okubute. </p><p>After the briefing, Okubute asked what the NNPC needed to do </p><p>to join the process.  The delegation informed him that the </p><p>purpose of their meeting was to inform the NNPC, and they </p><p>could benefit from the process by: 1) independently </p><p>incorporating the Principles in their own operations; and 2) </p><p>engaging U.S. and U.K. companies to share security best </p><p>practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Kupolokun said any process that promoted human </p><p>rights and helped long-term economic investment in the Delta </p><p>was a win-win situation for Nigeria and enjoyed his total </p><p>support. </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Discussion with Two Senators from the Delta </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The delegation had lunch with Niger Delta Senators </p><p>Udo Udoma from Akwa Ibom State, (Chair of the Appropriations </p><p>Committee), and Emmanuel W.J. Diffa from Bayelsa State (the </p><p>Alliance for Democracy Party Deputy Whip).  Both welcomed the </p><p>Principles as an effort to improve relations between the </p><p>companies and communities.  They described the recently </p><p>established Niger Delta Security Committee (NDSC) for oil </p><p>field security, and suggested that the Voluntary Principles </p><p>be brought to the NDSC\'s attention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The Senators felt that relations between the </p><p>companies and communities could improve, and that the legacy </p><p>of failed Federal government programs was part of the </p><p>problem.  They agreed that more needed to be done to bridge </p><p>the expectation gap between companies and communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Udoma mentioned the disagreement between Governor </p><p>Attah and Exxon-Mobil over the company\'s refusal to move its </p><p>national headquarters to Akwa Ibom.  Udoma was scheduled to </p><p>meet with Exxon-Mobil representatives, and said he would </p><p>present them with a copy of the Principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The delegation made a call on the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC) and received a briefing from </p><p>mid-level officials.  (Senior officers and staff were holding </p><p>a general meeting in Ebonyi State.)  The NHRC officials </p><p>informed the group that they receive over thirty complaints </p><p>of human rights violations a day and are unable to address </p><p>them all.  Moreover, the zonal office of the NHRC for the </p><p>Delta (in Port Harcourt) had not yet opened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Meeting the Companies in Lagos </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.   (SBU) In Lagos, the delegation called briefly on </p><p>Chevron-Texaco Managing Director Ray Wilcox, and spoke at </p><p>length with Sole Omole, Chevron\'s Government Relations </p><p>Officer.  Omole said that the Chevron-Texaco merger had </p><p>occupied most of their attention in 2001, and not much </p><p>progress had been made implementing the Voluntary Principles. </p><p>Nor, in fact, had they furthered Chevron-Texaco\'s stakeholder </p><p>dialogue to the degree expected.  He suggested a </p><p>working-level security meeting with the oil companies, and </p><p>presentation of the Principles to the Niger Delta Security </p><p>Committee.  The NDSC had discussed security issues in its </p><p>first three meetings, but not human rights.  He thought that </p><p>the Principles would be a good way to introduce the subject. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Omole also suggested a NGO meeting with company </p><p>representatives, similar to one held by Chevron in San </p><p>Francisco.  An impartial moderator and ground rules could </p><p>focus the discussion.  He stated the meeting should be held </p><p>in Lagos, and that the Constitutional Action Network should </p><p>be invited.  Omole was scheduled to attend a San Francisco </p><p>meeting the following week where the Voluntary Principles and </p><p>other corporate responsibility initiatives would be </p><p>discussed.  (Note: While American members of the delegation </p><p>met with Chevron-Texaco, the British delegation met with </p><p>representatives from Shell Nigeria. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) During an informal lunch attended by </p><p>representatives from Exxon-Mobil, Conoco and Shell, Precious </p><p>Omuku of Shell argued for introducing the Principles to the </p><p>Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) and its Security </p><p>Subcommittee.  He promised Shell would champion the </p><p>Principles within the OPTS.  John Capps, President and </p><p>Managing Director of Conoco Energy Nigeria Limited, said that </p><p>the Principles did not need to wait for the consensus </p><p>required by approval in OPTS.  While he acknowledged OPTS </p><p>approval would be helpful, companies could immediately </p><p>implement the Principles if they were consistent with their </p><p>internal corporate practices.  Capps said that Conoco was </p><p>implementing many of the Principles already. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) O.A. Adeyemi-Wilson, Exxon-Mobil General Manager </p><p>for External Affairs, and Cyril Odu, Exxon-Mobil General </p><p>Manager for Human Resources, were active participants in the </p><p>meeting even though their corporate headquarters have not </p><p>endorsed the Voluntary Principles.  Both agreed that tabling </p><p>the Principles before the OPTS was a good idea.  They said </p><p>they would reexamine the applicability of the Principles to </p><p>Exxon-Mobil operations in Nigeria.  If the Principles could </p><p>be successfully implemented in Nigeria, perhaps Exxon-Mobil </p><p>headquarters might be convinced to participate. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>The Non-Meeting with the Assistant Inspector General of Police </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Assistant Inspector General of Police for Operations </p><p>Theo Akeredolu postponed his Monday meeting with the </p><p>delegation until Wednesday. When the delegation returned from </p><p>Lagos for the meeting, Akeredolu then balked that he could </p><p>not officially meet with them without written approval from </p><p>the Presidency.  Because the matter dealt with national </p><p>security, he did not believe the Foreign Ministry\'s approval </p><p>was sufficient.  Despite his apparent reticence, he listened </p><p>as the delegation gave him a quick briefing on the Voluntary </p><p>Principles, and promised to keep him informed of their </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.(C) At the Presidency, Oby Ezekwesili, Special Advisor to </p><p>the President on Foreign Affairs, expressed her support for </p><p>the Principles, an effort she described as "supporting human </p><p>rights, good governance and the rule of law."  Ezekwesili </p><p>stressed the sensitivity of the Niger Delta and the </p><p>importance of working through appropriate bureaucratic </p><p>channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) The delegation assured her that the purpose of the </p><p>briefings was to provide information on the Principles to key </p><p>government entities.  They further noted that the process was </p><p>characterized by both discretion and deliberation: </p><p>Participants would "go no further in implementation without </p><p>the full support of the GON and only at a comfortable pace </p><p>for the companies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Ezekwesili requested a two-page non-paper on the </p><p>Principles to brief the President and to pass to the three </p><p>members of the Niger Delta Security Committee with whom she </p><p>has regular contact. The delegation said they would forward </p><p>through the Embassy a report of their visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) Comment: The initial reticence of GON Officials at </p><p>the Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet  or allow </p><p>meetings on the Principles evinces the Government\'s </p><p>sensitivity to Delta issues, including relations with oil </p><p>companies, police matters and foreign involvement in the </p><p>region.  These contretemps did not, however, hurt the </p><p>usefulness of the visit.  Once bureaucratic concerns were </p><p>addressed, all of the government officials supported the </p><p>Voluntary Principles and viewed them as a useful means for </p><p>promoting security in the Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Throughout the visit oil company representatives </p><p>appeared very open to the Voluntary Principles.  Assertions </p><p>by some of the companies that current practices already </p><p>accord with the Principles were encouraging.  However, both </p><p>the government\'s and the oil companies\' future approaches to </p><p>security and human rights in the Niger Delta must be measured </p><p>by their actions.  Chevron admits that they have made little </p><p>progress implementing the Principles and its MD seems </p><p>lukewarm to the process.  Clearly change is still needed and </p><p>it is possible that the Voluntary Principles may provide a </p><p>vehicle for such improvement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) Implementation will be the key. Progress will be </p><p>maximized by the establishment of an Embassy position with </p><p>responsibilities for corporate responsibility (including the </p><p>Voluntary Principles).  Continued contact on these issues </p><p>through the establishment of personal relationships between </p><p>the proposed Corporate Responsibility Officer and key Delta </p><p>and GON players is key to future success.  End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
