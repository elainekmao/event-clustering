<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 03266 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PREL, SY, LE, IS </p><p>SUBJ:  TALKING ABOUT ABU NIDAL </p><p> </p><p>REF:   STATE 165238 </p><p> </p><p>1.    CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.    THE RECENT INSTRUCTION TO ATHENS CONCERNING </p><p>ABU NIDAL ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA PROMPTS US TO SUGGEST </p><p>SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE USE </p><p>IN DISCUSSING THIS DIFFICULT SUBJECT WITH FRIENDS </p><p>AND ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.    WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE HERE OF CONTACTS BY </p><p>ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES WITH SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OR WITH ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES WHO PASS THROUGH SYRIA, </p><p>SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST THAT THE TWO </p><p>OFFICES HERE ACT AS A BASE OF SUPPORT FOR ABU NIDAL </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.    HOWEVER, IN TWO OTHER IMPORTANT WAYS, ABU </p><p>NIDAL FIGURES IN DAMASCUS SEEM TO WORK HAND IN GLOVE </p><p>WITH THE MAIN BODY OF THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>IN LIBYA.  FIRST, LOCAL EUROPEAN EMBASSIES IN </p><p>DAMASCUS HAVE RECEIVED VISITS OF LOCAL ABU NIDAL </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE AFTERMATH OF ATROCITIES IN AUSTRIA, </p><p>ITALY, FRANCE AND PERHAPS ELSEWHERE.  THE LINE IS </p><p>INVARIABLY THE SAME, VERY SOFTLY BUT FIRMLY SUGGEST </p><p>THAT THE DEATHS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IS REGRETTABLE </p><p>BUT THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS EVERY RIGHT </p><p>TO CARRY OUT SUCH ACTIVITIES AGAINST ISRAELI </p><p>TARGETS.  THEN, IN SOME VERY CAREFUL, INDIRECT </p><p>SENTENCES, THE OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD </p><p>BE POSSIBLE TO AVOID FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THIS </p><p>SORT BY REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS.  NO TERMS HAVE </p><p>BEEN SET IN THE INSTANCES WE KNOW OF AND EXPLICIT </p><p>OFFERS OF NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE.  INSTEAD, </p><p>THE DOOR IS OPENED.  IT IS INTERESTING BY-PRODUCT, </p><p>AND MAYBE A COINCIDENTAL ONE, THAT WITH ABU NIDAL </p><p>REPS IN DAMASCUS EUROPEANS INVARIABLY ASK SYRIA </p><p>TO INTERVENE WITH ABU NIDAL AND HELP THEM RESOLVE </p><p>THEIR PROBLEMS WITH TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF THESE ABU NIDAL OFFICES IN DAMASCUS, </p><p>THEREFORE, SERVES TO SUBTLY ENHANCE THE OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>SYRIA HAS TO PLAY A DIPLOMATIC ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE OTHER FUNCTION OF THESE OFFICES IS INDEED </p><p>CULTURAL AND INFORMATIONAL, AS PRESIDENT ASAD HAS </p><p>CLAIMED, AND IT CONSISTS OF ABU NIDAL REPS HANGING </p><p>OUT IN LOCAL HOTELS AND COLLARING FOREIGN JOURNALISTS </p><p>AND OFFICIALS.  INTERVIEWS ARE OFFERED IN THE BIQA\', </p><p>ALONG WITH ESCORTS AND GUARANTEES OF SAFETY.  ONE </p><p>CBS CREW VISITING DAMASCUS IN THE PAST WEEK SPOKE </p><p>QUITE FRANKLY OF THEIR DISCUSSIONS IN THE SHERATON </p><p>ALONG THESE LINES AND SAID THAT IF AN APPROPRIATE </p><p>INTERVIEW WERE ARRANGED, THAT IS WITH AN APPROPRIATE </p><p>OFFICIAL, CBS WOULD TAKE ITS CAMERA CREW IMMEDIATELY. </p><p>HOWEVER, SYRIANS DO NOT NECESSARILY APPROVE THESE </p><p>CONTACTS BY ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES, AND HAVE ACTED </p><p>QUITE HARSHLY AGAINST SOME JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE TRIED </p><p>TO FOLLOW THEM UP, BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT SYRIA </p><p>PROVIDES ABU NIDAL WITH A PULPIT AND A STAGE WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RANSOM </p><p></p></div>
