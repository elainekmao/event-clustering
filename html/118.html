<p>S E C R E T DAMASCUS 02090 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (TEXT ADDED PARA 7) </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBYAN SUPPORTED TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 98378 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING IS OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDIUM AND </p><p>LONG-TERM THREAT OF LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM IN </p><p>THE WAKE OF THE MARCH 24-25 EVENTS IN THE GULF OF </p><p>SIDRA, PER REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN OUR VIEW, QADHAFI\'S COFFERS WILL PROBABLY BE </p><p>EVEN MORE OPEN TO ABU NIDAL AND SOME OF THE DAMASCUS- </p><p>BASED PALESTINIANS THAN PREVIOUSLY ON ACCOUNT OF </p><p>THE EVENTS IN THE GULF OF SIDRA.  WHETHER THESE </p><p>GROUPS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN TERRORISM </p><p>FOR THIS REASON IS DIFFICULT TO SAY.  THEY HAVE </p><p>THEIR OWN AGENDA, WOULD OPERATE WITH OR WITHOUT </p><p>QADHAFI, AND ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED WITH </p><p>LIBYAN ISSUES SUCH AS THE GULF OF SIDRA PER SE.  WE </p><p>ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE WHETHER LIBYANS </p><p>WILL THEMSELVES BECOME MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  QADHAFI IS PROBABLY NOW </p><p>MOTIVATED TO PAY A HANDSOME PRICE TO HIRED KILLERS </p><p>TO GET AT AMERICANS, BUT HE WILL PRESUMABLY STILL </p><p>BE CONCERNED THAT ACCOUNTABILITY NOT BE DIRECTLY </p><p>TRACEABLE TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHEN ABU NIDAL COMMITS HIS NEXT OUTRAGE, WE </p><p>THINK IT VERY LIKELY HE WILL CITE THE EVENTS IN </p><p>THE GULF OF SIDRA AS AN EXCUSE.  OTHER DAMASCUS- </p><p>BASED PALESTINIAN GROUPS, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT </p><p>TARGET U.S. INTERESTS, ARE LESS LIKELY TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SYRIA ALLOWS ABU NIDAL TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE </p><p>IN SYRIA AND IN SYRIAN-CONTROLLED LEBANON.  RECENT </p><p>PUBLICITY GIVEN TO ITS CONNECTION TO ABU NIDAL </p><p>HAS BEEN A CAUSE OF SOME EMBARRASSMENT, BUT NOT </p><p>YET SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE SYRIA TO CLOSE THE DOOR </p><p>TO ABU NIDAL.  HOW MUCH SUPPORT SYRIA GIVES ABU NIDAL </p><p>IS DIFFICULT TO SAY. THE SYRIAN STYLE IS </p><p>COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM QADHAFI\'S--MORE SUBTLE, </p><p>LESS PUBLIC, LESS SELF-CONGRATULATING--AND THE </p><p>SYRIAN FOCUS IS NARROWER, MORE PURELY LOCAL AND </p><p>LESS IDEOLOGICAL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS WAS EVIDENT IN THE MARCH 27 DEMONSTRATION </p><p>IN DAMASCUS AGAINST AMERICAN ACTIVITIES IN THE </p><p>GULF OF SIDRA, SYRIAN POLICY IS TO PROTECT U.S. </p><p>FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL IN SYRIA.  SYRIA WANTS TO </p><p>MAINTAIN DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. AND DOES NOT PERCEIVE </p><p>AN INTEREST IN BEING SEEN TO DO HARM AGAINST U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS HERE.  DAMASCUS REMAINS ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>SECURE CITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALTHOUGH IT TOO </p><p>HAS SUFFERED FROM TERRORISM (MORE BOMBS HAVE </p><p>EXPLODED HERE IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS THAN IN AMMAN, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE). </p><p> </p><p>7.  THERE REMAINS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LIBYA MAY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO STAGE AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL </p><p>OR FACILITIES IN DAMASCUS WITHOUT SYRIAN KNOWLEDGE </p><p>OR APPROVAL.  THERE ARE TWO FACTORS WHICH MITIGATE </p><p>THIS:  THE VIGILANCE OF THE SYRIAN SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES, AND QADHAFI\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE NEGATIVE </p><p>EFFECT SUCH AN ATTACK WOULD HAVE ON SYRIAN-LIBYAN </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  EXCEPT FOR SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS </p><p>OF THE SA-5 SYSTEM, THE SYRIANS PROBABLY DERIVE </p><p>SATISFACTION FROM THE GULF OF SIDRA INCIDENT. </p><p>IT BROUGHT ARABS TOGETHER AGAINST THE U.S., </p><p>DEFLECTED ARAB LEAGUE ATTENTION FROM THE IRAN-IRAQ </p><p>WAR, AND PRODUCED THE APPEARANCE OF A CLOSER USSR </p><p>TIE TO THE ARABS.  IT WILL NOT MAVE A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>IMPACT ON ALREADY COOL BILATERAL </p><p>U.S.-SYRIAN TIES, EXCEPT TO ADD SOMEWHAT TO THE </p><p>PERCEPTION OF THE U.S. AS ANTI-ARAB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EAGLETON </p><p></p></div>
