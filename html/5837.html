(C) ONLY 50 MILES FROM ZAGREB, THE MUNICIPALITY OF VOJNIC </p><p>STANDS AS A STARK EXAMPLE OF THE ECONOMIC REALITIES FACED BY </p><p>CROATS, SERBS, AND MUSLIMS ALIKE IN CROATIA\'S WAR AFFECTED </p><p>REGIONS -- RURAL COMMUNITIES LONG PLAGUED BY ECONOMIC DECLINE </p><p>AND OUT MIGRATION.  THE EFFECTS OF THE 1991-1995 "HOMELAND" </p><p>WAR, PARTICULARLY THE POPULATION SHIFTS AND DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>PROPERTY, EXACERBATED AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN </p><p>VOJNIC.  THE ARRIVAL OF NEARLY 2,000 BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS </p><p>-- WHO BOOSTED THE CROAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION FROM </p><p>ONE TO OVER 36 PERCENT -- HAS ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FEW ECONOMIC PROSPECTS EXIST APART FROM SMALL SCALE </p><p>AGRICULTURE.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY 370 WAGE PAYING JOBS IN A </p><p>REGION WITH OVER 8,000 INHABITANTS, AND THE LARGEST EMPLOYER </p><p>IS REPORTED TO BE NEARLY BANKRUPT.  MUSLIMS ARE THE HARDEST </p><p>HIT, WITH NEARLY FULL UNEMPLOYMENT.  RETURN OF PROPERTY </p><p>REMAINS THE BIGGEST ISSUES FOR SERBS; OVER 500 SERB-OWNED </p><p>HOUSES REMAIN OCCUPIED, PRIMARILY BY BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS. </p><p>NO EVICTIONS HAVE BEEN ENFORCED TO DATE.  EVEN IF THERE WERE </p><p>A COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNMENT POLICY TO ADDRESS </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES -- AND THERE IS NONE -- IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ENVISION THE REGION EVER BEING VIABLE </p><p>ECONOMICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00376  01 OF 04  200658Z </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE MUNICIPALITY OF VOJNIC IS JUST 50 MILES SOUTHEAST </p><p>OF ZAGREB, BUT IS ANOTHER WORLD WHEN ONE COMPARES THE LIVING </p><p>STANDARDS -- ONE ALMOST FIRST WORLD, THE OTHER VERY MUCH </p><p>BACKWARD.  HILLY, ISOLATED, HUGGING THE BOSNIAN BORDER, </p><p>VOJNIC REMINDS AN AMERICAN VISITOR QUICKLY OF THE HOLLOWS OF </p><p>WEST VIRGINIA.  VOJNIC WAS A PART OF THE SERB CONTROLLED </p><p>KRAJINA FROM 1991-1995, AND WAS RETAKEN BY CROATIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN AUGUST 1995 UNDER OPERATION "STORM." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE PRE-WAR POPULATION WAS JUST OVER 8,000, DIVIDED </p><p>AMONG 46 VILLAGES -- 89 PERCENT SERB, 10 PERCENT MUSLIM, AND </p><p>ONLY ONE PERCENT CROAT.  INHABITANTS WERE FULLY "EMPLOYED" IN </p><p>THE SOCIALIST SENSE; MOST RESIDENTS WERE ENGAGED IN </p><p>AGRICULTURE, TIED IN WITH THE LARGE AGROKOMBINAT "AGROKOMERC" </p><p>LOCATED JUST OVER THE BORDER IN WHAT IS NOW BOSNIA (AND OWNED </p><p>BY FIKRET ABDIC, FORMER REGIONAL WARLORD, AND NOW A CONVICTED </p><p>WAR CRIMINAL).  WHAT LITTLE INDUSTRY EXISTED -- A FACTORY FOR </p><p>CLAY EXPLOITATION, CERAMICS, SAWMILL, IRON AND STEEL WORKS -- </p><p>WAS OUTDATED AND UNDERCAPITALIZED EVEN BEFORE THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>THE ECONOMY TODAY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AGRICULTURE REMAINS THE PREDOMINATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH ONLY 30 PERCENT OF ARABLE LAND IS BEING CULTIVATED </p><p>COMPARED TO NEARLY 100 PERCENT IN 1990.  VOJNIC\'S CATTLE </p><p>POPULATION IS JUST ONE-FIFTH ITS PRE-WAR LEVEL.  LACK OF </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAS LIMITED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF FARM </p><p>BUILDINGS, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION TO INCREASE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00376  01 OF 04  200658Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GOVERNMENT FINANCING HAS BEEN </p><p>USED TO RECONSTRUCT HOUSES, BUT ONCE THE HOUSE IS HABITABLE </p><p>RESIDENTS HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE MINISTRY OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND </p><p>CRAFTS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND UNDP, HAVE CO-FINANCED A LOAN </p><p>GUARANTEE FUND THAT NOW OPERATES IN EIGHT TOWNS.  BANKS ARE </p><p>ENCOURAGED BY THE GUARANTEE FUND TO LEND TO INDIVIDUALS WHO </p><p>WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESS.  AS PART OF THE SERVICE </p><p>PROVIDED, THE FUND WILL DEVELOP FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND ACT </p><p>AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE BANKS AND THE BORROWER, </p><p>PROVIDING ADVICE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SOME CHARGE DISCRIMINATION AT THE FUND.  AN EMPLOYEE </p><p>OF THE FUND TOLD US THAT, WHILE IT MAKES APPROXIMATELY TWO </p><p>HUNDRED LOANS A YEAR, ONLY ONE HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR A SERB </p><p>RETURNEE.  THE COLLATERAL THIS APPLICANT WAS REQUIRED TO </p><p>SUBMIT INCLUDED -- BUT WAS NOT LIMITED TO -- HIS HOUSE, AND A </p><p>PROMISSORY NOTE IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $71,000.  HE </p><p>HAD TO GET A PERSON EMPLOYED BY A GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO </p><p>CO-SIGN THE LOAN AS A CO-GUARANTOR.  THE LATER REQUIREMENT, </p><p>NOT UNCOMMON FOR BANKS IN CROATIA, EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATES THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A RETURNEE GETTING A LOAN.  WITHOUT THE </p><p>LIMITED ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>-- TO BUY A COW OR PIG, REPAIR THE SHELTER, AND BUY OTHER </p><p>SMALL SCALE AGRICULTURAL INPUTS -- MOST RETURNEES SAY THEY </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE COME BACK. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9128 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00376  02 OF 04  200658Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------388B91  200658Z /38 </p><p>R 200656Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9491 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ZAGREB 000376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR ACONVERY, EUR/SCE FOR MNARDI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, EAID, PREF, ECON, PGOV, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: VOJNIC: OFFERING EQUAL MISERY FOR ALL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00376  02 OF 04  200658Z </p><p>6. (C) SALARIED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN VOJNIC ARE FEW </p><p>AND FAR BETWEEN.  IN THE ENTIRE MUNICIPALITY, ONLY 370 </p><p>RESIDENTS ARE FORMALLY EMPLOYED, WHILE AROUND 800 ARE </p><p>REGISTERED AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT BUREAU.  AND ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>MAYOR, THE VOJNIC FORESTRY FIRM, THE MUNICIPALITY\'S LARGEST </p><p>EMPLOYER WITH 70 EMPLOYEES, IS FACING BANKRUPTCY.  THE OTHER </p><p>LEADING EMPLOYERS ARE A CERAMIC FACTORY (40 EMPLOYEES), A </p><p>SAWMILL (20 EMPLOYEES), A CLOTHING ENTERPRISE (20 EMPLOYEES), </p><p>AND A FACTORY FOR PLASTIC PRODUCTS (15 EMPLOYEES). </p><p> </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE MUSLIMS OF VOJNIC ARE STRONG CONTENDERS FOR THE </p><p>MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THE REGION.  ACCORDING TO IMAM DJURMIC, </p><p>THE LEADER OF THE LOCAL MUSLIM COMMUNITY, UNEMPLOYMENT VERGES </p><p>ON 95 PERCENT, ILLITERACY IS 80 PERCENT, AND THERE ARE NO </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYMENT.  IN OUR DISCUSSION, HIS COMMENTS </p><p>WERE OFTEN HYPERBOLIC, AND HIS NUMBERS WERE OFTEN AT ODDS </p><p>WITH OTHER KNOWN FACTS -- GIVING CREDENCE TO THE ADAGE THAT </p><p>42.7 PERCENT OF ALL STATISTICS ARE MADE UP ON THE SPOT -- BUT </p><p>DJURMIC PAINTED A GENERALLY ACCURATE PICTURE.  THE TWO </p><p>BIGGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION, THE SAWMILL AND CERAMIC </p><p>WORKS, HE CLAIMED, EMPLOY NOT A SINGLE MUSLIM.  SEVERAL </p><p>COMMUNITIES ARE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.  IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN </p><p>CROATS AND SERBS, MUSLIM HOMES WERE LARGELY LEFT INTACT, AND </p><p>SO EMPLOYMENT, RATHER THAN PROPERTY, IS THE MAIN ISSUE </p><p>CONFRONTING THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DESPITE DJURMIC\'S GRIM PICTURE, THE MUNICIPALITY\'S </p><p>MUSLIM POPULATION APPEARS TO BE INCREASING.  MUSLIM LEADERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00376  02 OF 04  200658Z </p><p>CLAIM THERE ARE 1,600 MUSLIMS IN THE REGION, WHILE THE 2001 </p><p>CENSUS ACKNOWLEDGES ONLY 768, OR 14 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS, 1,350 MUSLIMS ARE </p><p>REGISTERED IN THE MUNICIPALITY.  MANY HAVE BOTH BOSNIAN AND </p><p>CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP, AND WORK IN BOSNIA.  THE PRE-WAR </p><p>PATTERN OF LIVING IN CROATIA AND WORKING IN BOSNIA WAS </p><p>UNREMARKABLE WHEN ALL WERE CITIZENS OF YUGOSLAVIA; BUT NOW, </p><p>DUE IN PART TO MISSED DEADLINES, AND ALSO TO WAR AND </p><p>OCCUPATION, SOME MUSLIMS WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BORN IN </p><p>CROATIA BUT HAVE LIVED HERE "FOREVER" ARE EXPERIENCING </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING CITIZENSHIP AND OTHER DOCUMENTS </p><p>NECESSARY FOR RECEIVING RETIREMENT AND/OR SOCIAL BENEFITS. </p><p>ONE SERB RETURNEE, POINTING OUT HIS WINDOW TO THE LARGE NEW </p><p>HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET, TOLD US THAT MUSLIMS FROM BOSNIA ARE </p><p>BUYING UP BOTH HOUSES AND PROPERTY IN THE REGION IN THE HOPE </p><p>THAT IT WILL HELP THEM GET RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) POLITICALLY, THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS BEING COURTED BY </p><p>BOTH THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ), ON THE RIGHT, AND </p><p>THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP), ON THE LEFT.  IN A UNIQUE </p><p>TURN OF EVENTS WHICH BEGAN LAST FALL WHEN THREE SDP </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY AND BECAME </p><p>INDEPENDENT, THE VOJNIC MUNICIPAL COUNCIL WAS FORMALLY </p><p>DISSOLVED IN JANUARY.  THE GOC APPOINTED A CARETAKER </p><p>"COMMISSIONER," AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE FROM NEARBY KARLOVAC, TO </p><p>RUN THE MUNICIPALITY UNTIL BY-ELECTIONS, WHICH MUST BE HELD </p><p>BY MID-APRIL.  ONE RESULT OF THE ENSUING POLITICAL VACUUM WAS </p><p>THAT USAID\'S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (MOU) WITH THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITY LAPSED.  WITH SUCCESS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL WILL AND COOPERATIVENESS OF THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL, </p><p>USAID WAS RELUCTANT TO EXTEND THE MOU PRIOR TO A BY-ELECTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00376  02 OF 04  200658Z </p><p> </p><p>SERB RETURNEES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) REPOSSESSION OF PROPERTY REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO RETURN.  ACCORDING TO USAID SOURCES, </p><p>BY LATE 2002 OWNERS HAD SUBMITTED 385 REQUESTS FOR RETURN OF </p><p>PROPERTY.  OVER 600 PRIVATELY OWNED HOUSES AND 66 APARTMENTS </p><p>WERE DAMAGED IN THE WAR.  AT THE END OF 2002, APPROXIMATELY </p><p>300 REQUESTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE WERE STILL </p><p>PENDING.  AS A RESULT OF THE WAR AND ENSUING OBSTACLES TO </p><p>RETURN, THE SERB POPULATION HAS BEEN REDUCED TO APPROXIMATELY </p><p>ONE THIRD ITS PRE-WAR LEVEL -- FROM OVER 7,000 TO UNDER 3,000 </p><p>INHABITANTS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) DRAGAN VUCKOVIC, 57, REPRESENTS A TYPICAL SERB </p><p>RETURNEE IN THE VOJNIC AREA.  THE HEAD OF AN EXTENDED FAMILY </p><p>OF FOUR, WITH ONE CHILD, VUCKOVIC RETURNED TO HIS RESIDENCE </p><p>"SPONTANEOUSLY" (THAT IS, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT OR NGO </p><p>ASSISTANCE) IN 2001.  HIS HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED, BUT </p><p>WAS DAMAGED IN THE WAR.  ALL FARM-RELATED EQUIPMENT AND </p><p>SUPPLIES WERE LOST.  PRIOR TO THE WAR HE WAS A RELATIVELY </p><p>PROSPEROUS FARMER, MANAGING 18 HECTARES AND A HERD OF CATTLE. </p><p> OFF FARM EMPLOYMENT WAS AVAILABLE, PROVIDING A CUSHION TO </p><p>SOFTEN THE VAGARIES OF AN AGRICULTURAL EXISTENCE.  NOW, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9134 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------388BA8  200659Z /38 </p><p>R 200656Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9492 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR ACONVERY, EUR/SCE FOR MNARDI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, EAID, PREF, ECON, PGOV, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: VOJNIC: OFFERING EQUAL MISERY FOR ALL </p><p> </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO OFF FARM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z </p><p>THE VUCKOVIC FAMILY RETURNED TO CROATIA WITH NO IMMEDIATE </p><p>PROSPECT OUTSIDE THE PROMISE OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND </p><p>A MONTHLY PENSION OF APPROXIMATELY $55. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THANKS TO PRM PROGRAMS, VUCKOVIC RECEIVED ASSISTANCE </p><p>FOR SHELTER REPAIR AND FOR AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT.  USAID </p><p>PROVIDED A SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE LOAN, WHICH WAS USED </p><p>TO BUY FOUR DAIRY COWS.  WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE VUCKOVIC </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN.  WITH HIS FEW COWS AND </p><p>SMALL MILK COOLER AND THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF A </p><p>USAID-FUNDED NGO AND THE VINDIJA AND KIM COMPANIES, WHICH </p><p>HAVE ORGANIZED MILK COLLECTION FOR THE REGION, VUCKOVIC HAS </p><p>INCREASED HIS INCOME TO NEARLY $300 PER MONTH.  HE IS </p><p>INCREASING HIS HERD AND TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REPAIR FARM </p><p>BUILDINGS.  ALTHOUGH HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, HE IS GLAD TO </p><p>BE BACK IN HIS HOUSE, REPORTS GOOD RELATIONS WITH LOCAL </p><p>CROATS, AND IS PLANNING FOR A BETTER FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) OVER 500 BOSNIAN CROAT FAMILIES FROM NORTHWESTERN </p><p>BOSNIA ARE ACCOMMODATED IN SERB-OWNED HOUSES IN THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITY.  SOME WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO BOSNIA, BUT </p><p>EITHER CANNOT OR ARE UNWILLING, GIVEN HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, OR </p><p>SOCIAL PROBLEMS THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER IN BOSNIA.  EMPLOYMENT </p><p>IS NOT THE PRIMARY ISSUE FOR SETTLERS -- THEY HAVE OBTAINED </p><p>STATE AND STATE SUPPORTED JOBS, AND FACE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS </p><p>LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF THE AVERAGE CROATIAN IN THE </p><p>REGION.  HOUSING IS THE BIG ISSUE.  BOSNIAN CROATS RECOGNIZE </p><p>THEY ARE VIEWED AS A PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND WHILE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z </p><p>MAJORITY WANTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE RAPIDLY, THEY ARE NOT </p><p>GOING TO VACATE HOUSES WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO GO. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THEY ARE NOT INCLINED TO LET THIS GOVERNMENT OFF </p><p>THE HOOK FOR PROMISES (HOUSING, JOBS, ETC.) MADE BY THE HDZ </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO INDUCE THEM TO SETTLE IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) ONE BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER AFFILIATED WITH THE </p><p>ASSOCIATION OF CROATIAN SETTLERS, WHICH CLAIMS TO SPEAK FOR </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF SETTLERS, HAS SAID THAT </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT CONSISTS OF BOSNIAN CROATS </p><p>BEING TOLD "YOU MUST..." FOLLOWED BY "SOMETHING BAD." </p><p>CONSERVATIVE POLITICALLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF BOSNIAN CROATS </p><p>REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE NOW OPPOSITION CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC </p><p>UNION (HDZ) PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN. IN A </p><p>SENSE THEY REPRESENT AN UNWANTED CASTE -- ALL BUT ABANDONED </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR ETHNIC "HOMELAND," SCORNED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE OBSTACLE THEY </p><p>REPRESENT TO THE RETURN PROCESS, DIFFERENT FROM THEIR NEW </p><p>CROATIAN CROAT NEIGHBORS BOTH CULTURALLY AND SOCIALLY, AND OF </p><p>COURSE, DESPISED BY THE SERBS WHOSE HOMES THEY OCCUPY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) VOJNIC IS NEITHER ALONE NOR SPECIAL IN ITS </p><p>PREDICAMENT; IT IS ONE OF MANY MARGINAL RURAL AREAS THAT WERE </p><p>IN DECLINE WELL BEFORE THE WAR, WHICH SERVED TO HASTEN AND </p><p>COMPLICATE AN ALREADY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  THE BORDER AREAS OF THE KRAJINA, LIKE THOSE OF </p><p>THE DALMATIAN HINTERLANDS, POSE A SERIOUS ECONOMIC CHALLENGE </p><p>FOR CROATIA.  THE WAR ACCELERATED WHAT OTHERWISE WAS A LONG, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z </p><p>SEEMINGLY INEVITABLE DECLINE.  SOME REGIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY </p><p>1990 HAD DECLINED TO LESS THAN HALF THEIR PRE-WORLD WAR II </p><p>POPULATIONS.  AND PART OF WHAT KEPT THE REGION VIABLE DURING </p><p>TITO TIMES WAS THE FINANCIAL BOOST PROVIDED BY MILITARY BASES </p><p>AND FACILITIES -- AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS NO LONGER PROVIDED. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT\'S CHALLENGE IS DAUNTING. </p><p>ACCORDING TO UNDP, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEITHER A POLICY NOR </p><p>ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO.  WE SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR A GOVERNMENT </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WHO IS TASKED EITHER TO WORK ON ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ISSUES GENERALLY, OR SPECIFICALLY ON WAR-AFFECTED </p><p>AREAS.  THE JULY 2002 AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW ON AREAS OF </p><p>SPECIAL STATE CONCERN (THE SO-CALLED WAR AFFECTED AREAS) </p><p>IMPLICITLY RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO KEEP </p><p>BUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTING HOUSES WHEN THERE ARE NO </p><p>EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND A COMMISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ISSUES.
