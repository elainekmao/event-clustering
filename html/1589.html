<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 001599 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECIN, SADC, WA </p><p>SUBJECT: SADC SUMMIT:  SOUTH AFRICA HOPED FOR MORE ON ORGAN </p><p> </p><p>REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: WINDHOEK 526 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNSELOR JMCNAMARA, REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI WAS </p><p>DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MARCH 9 SADC SUMMIT DID NOT SELECT THE </p><p>SUCCESSOR TO ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AS CHAIR OF THE </p><p>ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY.  SAG OFFICIALS </p><p>INDICATED MARCH 13 THAT MBEKI PREFERRED THIS DECISION BE MADE </p><p>IN WINDHOEK SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THE ORGAN\'S CHAIRMANSHIP DID </p><p>INDEED ROTATE IN AUGUST 2001.  SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS APPEAR </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE SUMMIT\'S APPROVAL OF SADC\'S RESTRUCTURING </p><p>EXERCISE BUT STRESSED THAT MUCH WORK NEEDED TO BE DONE TO </p><p>ACHIEVE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS BY </p><p>THE TWO-YEAR TARGET DATE.  ON ZIMBABWE, SAG OFFICIALS </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT THE ISSUE "SIMPLY WAS NOT DISCUSSED" AT </p><p>SUMMIT.  ON THE DROC, SAG OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT MAURITIUS </p><p>OFFERED TO HOST THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ORGAN REFORM - SAG RELIEF BUT DOUBTS REMAIN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  AT A MARCH 13 BRIEFING TO EUROPEAN UNION DIPLOMATS </p><p>WHICH POLOFF ATTENDED, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' (DFA) </p><p>CHIEF DIRECTOR FOR SADC AFFAIRS G KUDJOE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS AJ BRAMDEO, AND SADC GENERAL AFFAIRS </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WENDY RAUCH TOLD THE ASSEMBLED AUDIENCE </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE\'S REPORT TO THE SUMMIT ON REFORM OF THE ORGAN </p><p>FOR POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (THE ORGAN) CONTAINED NO </p><p>SURPRISES.  THE SADC SUMMIT UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE YEARLY ROTATION OF THE ORGAN CHAIR BEGINNING IN AUGUST </p><p>2001, WHEN THE SUMMIT WOULD SELECT A NEW CHAIR.  ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE CURRENT ORGAN CHAIR, WOULD RETAIN THIS </p><p>POSITION IN THE INTERIM PERIOD AND WOULD BECOME A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE ORGAN TROIKA (COMPOSED OF CURRENT, PAST, AND FUTURE ORGAN </p><p>CHAIR) IN AUGUST.  KUDJOE INDICATED THAT THE SUMMIT WOULD </p><p>ALSO SELECT THE FUTURE ORGAN CHAIR AT THE BLANTYRE SUMMIT. </p><p>ASIDE FROM STATING THAT THE ORGAN CHAIR COULD NOT </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY HOLD THE SADC CHAIRMANSHIP, KUDJOE GAVE NO </p><p>INDICATION AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE NEXT TWO CHAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  BOTH KUDJOE AND BRAMDEO EXPLAINED HOW SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI ATTEMPTED TO SECURE THE NAMING OF THE NEXT </p><p>SADC CHAIR AT THE WINDHOEK SUMMIT, ONLY TO MEET WITH NO </p><p>RESPONSE FROM HIS FELLOW SADC HEADS OF STATE.  THE SAG, SAID </p><p>KUDJOE, WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE NAMING OF THE NEXT </p><p>CHAIR IN ORDER TO "CLOSE THE CHAPTER" ON ORGAN REFORM. </p><p>BRAMDEO INDICATED THAT THE SAG WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THIS AS </p><p>ADDED ASSURANCE THAT THE CHAIRMANSHIP WOULD INDEED ROTATE IN </p><p>AUGUST.  NEVERTHELESS, SOUTH AFRICA FIRMLY SUPPORTS SADC </p><p>SUMMIT\'S OVERALL DECISION ON ORGAN REFORM, CONCLUDED KUDJOE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, THE ORGAN\'S CHAIR WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>ITS OWN SECRETARIAT WHICH WOULD BE HOUSED WITH THE SADC </p><p>SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT FOR RAMSAMY AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA FULLY SUPPORTS FORMER ACTING EXECUTIVE </p><p>SECRETARY RAMSAMY AS THE NEW SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, SAID </p><p>BRAMDEO.  GOING TO SOME PAINS TO DESCRIBE RAMSAMY\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT PROCESS,  NAMIBIAN FIRST SECRETARY SACKY SHIVUTE </p><p>TOLD POLOFF MARCH 14 THAT AFTER A "LONG AND INTENSIVE" </p><p>INTERVIEW PROCESS, THE SADC TROIKA PLUS SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE CHOSE RAMSAMY AS THE "BEST" CANDIDATE FOR EXECUTIVE </p><p>SECRETARY.  SHIVUTE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ANGOLA MOUNTED A </p><p>SERIOUS LOBBYING CAMPAIGN ON BEHALF OF ITS CANDIDATE, BUT </p><p>THAT RAMSAMY WAS JUDGED THE BETTER CANDIDATE.  RATHER </p><p>UNCHARITABLY, SHIVUTE ADDED ON AN ASIDE THAT MUCH OF </p><p>RAMSAMY\'S SUCCESS AS ACTING EXECUTIVE SECRETARY WAS PROBABLY </p><p>DUE TO HIS "PROFESSIONAL" SUPPORT STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BRAMDEO, THE SADC SUMMIT REALIZES THAT </p><p>BOTH SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND SECRETARIAT NEEDED TO BE </p><p>STRENGTHENED TO OVERSEE THE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. </p><p>SADC, SAID BRAMDEO, NEEDED TO BETTER DEFINE THE MANDATE OF </p><p>BOTH THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND THE SECRETARIAT.  THE SADC </p><p>TREATY NEEDED TO BE AMENDED, ADDED KUDJOE, TO RESTRUCTURE THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY APPOINTMENT PROCESS FROM AN ELECTION </p><p>FORMAT TO ONE BASED ON "JOB INTERVIEWS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM AN EU DIPLOMAT, </p><p>BRAMDEO EXPLAINED THAT SADC DECIDED NOT TO UPGRADE THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY POSITION TO A SECRETARY GENERAL POSITION </p><p>BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD ENTAIL REDEFINING HIS RELATIONSHIP </p><p>VIS-A-VIS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE OAU\'S </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL.  FURTHER, SAID BRAMDEO, WITH REGARD TO </p><p>FUTURE APPOINTMENTS, SADC IS ANTICIPATING INTEREST FROM </p><p>APPLICANTS SUCH AS REGIONAL MINISTERS OR CEO\'S OF LARGE </p><p>COMPANIES.  IF THE POSITION WERE UPGRADED TO THE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL LEVEL, APPROPRIATE APPLICANTS WOULD HAVE TO BE AT THE </p><p>HEADS OF STATE LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>SECTOR COORDINATING UNIT REFORM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE SAG OFFICIALS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE APPROVED </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR CONSOLIDATING THE SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS </p><p>(SCUS) INTO FOUR DIRECTORATES:  TRADE, INDUSTRY, FINANCE, AND </p><p>INVESTMENT; FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES; </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES; AND SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS (REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORM PROCESS WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY </p><p>AND THE TRADE DIRECTORATE SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL BY AUGUST </p><p>2001.  ALL FOUR DIRECTORATES WILL BE BASED IN GABORONE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COST IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REFORMED SADC REMAIN </p><p>SKETCHY, SAID KUDJOE.  SHE REVIEWED THE POSSIBLE FORMULAS: </p><p>ASSESSMENT RATES BASED ON GDP, POPULATION SIZE, A COMBINATION </p><p>OF THE TWO, OR RETAINING THE CURRENT STRUCTURE.  KUDJOE </p><p>OPINED THAT PLACING TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMBER STATES\' </p><p>POPULATION COULD PREJUDICE THE DROC AND TANZANIA, TWO OF THE </p><p>REGION\'S MOST POPULATED STATES ASIDE FROM SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  ALSO UNCLEAR, CONTINUED BRAMDEO, IS THE REFORMED </p><p>SADC STAFFING PATTERNS.  SOME SCUS WITH LARGE STAFFS WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY END UP RETRENCHING NUMEROUS OFFICIALS WHILE OTHERS </p><p>MIGHT RETAIN MORE.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOUTH AFRICA CURRENTLY PLANS </p><p>TO SEND ABOUT TWO OF ITS EIGHT-PERSON FINANCE SCU TO </p><p>GABORONE.  KUDJOE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S GABORONE STAFF WOULD INCREASE, WITH AN </p><p>ENVISIONED MINIMUM OF 129. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE INITIAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD OF TWO YEARS ACCELERATED, WITH THE </p><p>PHASING OUT OF THE SCUS TAKING PLACE IN LESS TIME THAN THIS. </p><p>THE MORE RAPIDLY THE UNITS CAN BE DISMANTLED, THE SOONER THE </p><p>FOUR NEW DIRECTORATES CAN BE ESTABLISHED, STRESSED KUDJOE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  AN INTEGRATED COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS (SEPARATE FROM </p><p>THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS) WILL OVERSEE THE DIRECTORATES\' </p><p>PROGRAMS AND WILL ASSIST THE SCUS IN DISMANTLING AND </p><p>TRANSFERRING TO GABORONE.  BY THE END OF DECEMBER, SAID </p><p>BRAMDEO, THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE ORGANIZED A REGIONAL </p><p>INDICATIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>TREATY AMENDMENT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  KUDJOE MAINTAINED THAT SADC WOULD EMBARK ON THE </p><p>SADC TREATY AMENDMENT PROCESS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE TARGET OF </p><p>PRESENTING THE AMENDMENT PROPOSALS TO THE BLANTYRE SUMMIT IN </p><p>AUGUST 2001 FOR APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  THE SADC SUMMIT AGREED THAT THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS SHOULD MEET FOUR TIMES A YEAR INSTEAD OF THE </p><p>CURRENT TWICE A YEAR PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>DROC </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  KUDJOE COMMENTED THAT DROC PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA </p><p>SPOKE "WELL" AT WINDHOEK.  MAURITIUS, AS A CURRENT UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER, OFFERED TO HOST THE DROC\'S NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>COMESA </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  SADC SUMMIT DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE INCREASED TIES </p><p>WITH COMESA AT THIS TIME, REPORTED KUDJOE, BUT SUPPORTED </p><p>"COLLABORATING" WITH COMESA ON SELECT ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, ZIMBABWE "SIMPLY DID NOT COME </p><p>UP" AT WINDHOEK.  SHE ADDED THAT IT WAS UNFAIR TO BE ASKED </p><p>(AS ONE EU DIPLOMAT DID) WHY SOUTH AFRICA DID NOT RAISE THIS </p><p>SUBJECT AT THE SUMMIT.  "WHY NOT ASK MALAWI," DIRECTED </p><p>KUDJOE.  SHE CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT THE SUMMIT WAS NOT THE </p><p>PROPER FORA FOR DISCUSSING EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  AFTER EXPENDING COUNTLESS MAN-HOURS TO THE ORGAN </p><p>REVIEW PROCESS, SOUTH AFRICA CAN BARELY WAIT FOR THE REFORM </p><p>TO BE COMPLETED ONCE AND FOR ALL.  THE SAG WILL NOT REST EASY </p><p>UNTIL A NEW ORGAN CHAIR IS FINALLY NAMED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEWIS </p><p></p></div>
