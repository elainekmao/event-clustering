<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 005714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); EUR/ERA, IO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SODANO HINTS AT SHIFT IN HOLY SEE UN STATUS; TAKES </p><p>AIM AT PREEMPTIVE STRIKE, EU CONSTITUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) THE HOLY SEE IS CONSIDERING  UPGRADING ITS STATUS </p><p>AT THE UN FROM PERMANENT OBSERVER TO FULL MEMBER.  IN AN </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH CENTRIST ITALIAN DAILY "CORRIERE DELLA SERA" </p><p>PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 24, VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE (PM </p><p>EQUIVALENT) CARDINAL ANGELO SODONO SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05714  251549Z </p><p>STUDYING WAYS TO AUGMENT ITS PRESENCE AT THE UN.  ASKED IF </p><p>THIS MEANT BECOMING A FULL MEMBER, SODANO RESPONDED, "IF IT </p><p>WOULD BE USEFUL, I\'M NOT EXCLUDING IT."  SODANO NOTED THAT </p><p>SWITZERLAND HAD RECENTLY CHANGED ITS STATUS TO MEMBER AND </p><p>THAT, "THE FORM OF OUR PRESENCE IS AN OPEN QUESTION." </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) SODANO ALSO TOUCHED ON A POSSIBLE PREEMPTIVE STRIKE </p><p>ON IRAQ SAYING THAT THE TERM DID NOT FEATURE IN THE UN\'S </p><p>VOCABULARY AND THAT DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS SHOULD </p><p>BE EXHAUSTED BEFORE ANY OTHER HYPOTHESIS IS PROPOSED. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) SODANO REAFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO SEE </p><p>CHRISTIANITY, AND RELIGION IN GENERAL, GIVEN A PLACE IN THE </p><p>PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION (SEPTEL).  HE SAID THE HOLY </p><p>SEE EXPECTS EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN PATRIMONY TO BE MENTIONED IN </p><p>ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION -- DEALING WITH EUROPEAN </p><p>VALUES -- AND THAT A COMPLETELY NEW ARTICLE WOULD ENSHRINE </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN </p><p>EUROPE TO SELF-GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) COMMENT: SODANO\'S COMMENTS ON THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>STATUS AT THE UN REFLECT SOME INTERNAL FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE </p><p>LIMITATIONS ON THE HOLY SEE\'S VOICE IN INTERNATIONAL FORA </p><p>ARISING FROM THEIR STATUS AS A PERMANENT OBSERVER. </p><p>TRADITIONALLY, THE HOLY SEE HAS ENJOYED THE FREEDOM ITS </p><p>UNIQUE STATUS OFFERS IT AS A VOICE WITHIN, BUT NOT OF, THE </p><p>UN SYSTEM.  WHILE A MORAL VOICE HAS SOME CLOUT, MANY VATICAN </p><p>DIPLOMATS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT A VOTE -- ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL AND AFFILIATED UN AGENCIES -- MAY BE MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING THE HOLY SEE\'S INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE\'S OUTGOING FAO REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05714  251549Z </p><p>RECENTLY SUGGESTED IN AN "30 DAYS" ARTICLEARTICLE IN </p><p>CATHOLIC MONTHLY "30 DAYS" THAT THE HOLY SEE COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>MORE INFLUENTIAL IN COMBATING WORLD HUNGER IF IT WERE A </p><p>VOTING MEMBER OF THE FAO.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE </p><p>ONGOING STRUGGLE OVER A GLOBAL BAN ON HUMAN CLONING HAS </p><p>STRENGTHENED THE DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE HOLY SEE. </p><p>SWITZERLAND\'S CHANGE OF STATUS HAS CLEARLY SPARKED SOME </p><p>RECONSIDERATION WITHIN THE HOLY SEE AS TO WHETHER THE TIME </p><p>IS RIGHT TO MAKE A SHIFT.  WITH CURRENT UN PERMREP RENATO </p><p>MARTINO RETURNING TO ROME AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS IN NEW YORK, </p><p>THIS ISSUE IS LIKELY TO BE INTENSIVELY DEBATED IN THE MONTHS </p><p>AHEAD.  A DECISION TO UPGRADE WOULD MARK A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>DEPARTURE IN THE HOLY SEE\'S APPROACH TO PURSUIT OF ITS </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p></div>
