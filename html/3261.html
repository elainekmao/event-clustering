FODAG HAS RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF PROPOSING A </p><p>RESOLUTION THAT WOULD BOTH REQUIRE EACH FAO PROGRAM TO BE </p><p>EVALUATED AND EACH PROGRAM TO HAVE A SUNSET DATE (I.E. SO </p><p>THAT THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE RENEWED UNLESS THE EVALUATION </p><p>SHOWS THE CONTINUING RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE </p><p>PROGRAM) TO A NUMBER OF FAO INTERLOCUTORS ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03317  080701Z </p><p>OCCASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ACTING PERM REP RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF A SPECIFIC </p><p>RESOLUTION THAT WOULD BOTH REQUIRE EACH PROGRAM TO BE </p><p>EVALUATED AND EACH PROGRAM TO HAVE A SUNSET DATE OM MARCH </p><p>2002 WITH THE FAO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM, BUDGET AND </p><p>EVALUATION, TONY WADE.  MR. WADE RESPONDED ON MARCH 18  THAT </p><p>THE FAO GOVERNING BODIES HAVE "MADE SPECIFIC DECISIONS AS </p><p>REGARDS THE INTRODUCTION OF RESULTS BASED BUDGETING AND THE </p><p>FACT THAT EVALUATION WILL BE APPLIED TO IT SO AS TO ENSURE </p><p>CONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OR </p><p>TERMINATION OF PROGRAMS" AND OFFERED THE SUGGESTION THAT THE </p><p>HELMS-BIDEN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS WERE "SUBSTANTIALLY </p><p>SATISFIED BY THE ACTIONS ALREADY TAKEN BY FAO\'S GOVERNING </p><p>BODIES." (REFTEL C) </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACTING PERM REP RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF A SPECIFIC </p><p>RESOLUTION THAT WOULD BOTH REQUIRE EACH PROGRAM TO BE </p><p>EVALUATED AND EACH PROGRAM TO HAVE A SUNSET DATE WITH THE </p><p>U.K. AMBASSADOR TO THE FAO, ANTHONY BEATTIE ON MARCH 16.  AS </p><p>REPORTED IN REFTEL C, MR. BEATTIE\'S REACTION WAS THAT A </p><p>RESOLUTION WAS UNNECESSARY AND ONLY INCREASED THE RISK THAT </p><p>SOME MEMBERS WOULD BECOME SUSPICIOUS AND IMPOSE BLOCK ON ANY </p><p>FURTHER PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACTING PERM REP DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A SPECIFIC </p><p>RESOLUTION THAT WOULD BOTH REQUIRE EACH PROGRAM TO BE </p><p>EVALUATED AND EACH PROGRAM TO HAVE A SUNSET DATE WITH THE </p><p>DUTCH AMBASSADOR TO THE FAO, JAN BERTELING (AMBASSADOR </p><p>BERTELING IS ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE FAO PROGRAM COMMITTEE), </p><p>AT A LUNCH ON APRIL 4, 2002.

HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT IMPROVEMENTS HAD </p><p>BEEN MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF EVALUATION, WITH TIME-LIMITED </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND ADDED THAT THIS PROCESS COULD AND SHOULD BE </p><p>IMPROVED.  AMBASSADOR BERTELING ALSO EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT </p><p>THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THIS DISCUSSION WAS THE FAO </p><p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE. </p><p>HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03317 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
