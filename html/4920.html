<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000003 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, PM, PM/HDP </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PHUM, PREF, EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  ACTION REQUEST:  Demining assistance for </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 01/02/03 Fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) 02 Colombo 2022, and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly.  Message contains an </p><p>**ACTION REQUEST** -- Please see Para 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mines/UXO are a serious problem in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  After a very successful stint, the U.S.- </p><p>sponsored QRDF program ended operations in late 2002. </p><p>Mission has recently learned that a follow-on demining </p><p>program involving DoD-run training has been postponed. </p><p>We request that Washington continue to push hard for the </p><p>implementation of this program.  We also request that </p><p>Department examine putting in place other programs, such </p><p>as the Marshall Legacy Institute\'s Mine Dog Program.  We </p><p>believe strongly that demining reinforces U.S. policy </p><p>goals in Sri Lanka, and request that Department initiate </p><p>a bottom-up review of how we can re-establish our </p><p>presence in this key area ASAP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SCOPE OF PROBLEM:  Sri Lanka has a serious </p><p>mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) problem.  According to </p><p>UNDP estimates, there are an estimated 100-150,000 mines </p><p>in Jaffna.  There also could be up to 400,000 mines in </p><p>the Wanni region in the north, which is controlled by </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The degree </p><p>of the problem in the east is not clear, but there are </p><p>believed to be some mines and significant UXO.  The UN </p><p>estimates that 10-20 Sri Lankans are killed or injured </p><p>in mine/UXO accidents each month.  There are fears that </p><p>these figures could spike due to the steady return of </p><p>displaced persons (IDP\'s) to points of origin in the </p><p>north and east.  (Note:  Since the peace process began </p><p>in December 2001, over 230,000 IDP\'s have returned to </p><p>their home areas and the figure continues to surge </p><p>upwards.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) U.S. EFFORTS:  After approximately seven months </p><p>of operation, the U.S.-sponsored Quick Reaction Demining </p><p>Force (QRDF) wrapped up its work in Jaffna in late </p><p>October 2002.  At the completion of its operations, the </p><p>QRDF had cleared to international humanitarian demining </p><p>standards approximately 122,000 square meters, and </p><p>removed 980 mines and 42 pieces of UXO.  As reviewed in </p><p>Ref B, the QRDF effort received widespread acclaim in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  While performing practical work that is </p><p>allowing for the safe return of displaced persons to </p><p>demined areas, the QRDF became a symbol of our support </p><p>for the GSL\'s peace initiative and garnered highly </p><p>positive press coverage for the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The QRDF program was especially impressive in </p><p>light of the fact that other donors have been slow to </p><p>assist Sri Lanka, mainly because the GSL has not signed </p><p>the Ottawa Convention banning the use of mines.  While </p><p>showing some signs of life of late, the UN program has </p><p>yet to get off the ground in any significant way.  In </p><p>the meantime, the GSL and LTTE are implementing demining </p><p>programs, but neither side is well-trained nor capable </p><p>of clearing land to international humanitarian demining </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) NEXT STEPS:  With the QRDF\'s departure, the </p><p>next step in U.S. demining assistance was supposed to be </p><p>a large-scale DoD-run training program for Sri Lankan </p><p>military personnel and civilians, which was publicly </p><p>slated to start as early as January 2003.  The Sri </p><p>Lankan government had signed off on this program and was </p><p>looking forward to its start-up.  We now understand, </p><p>however, that implementation of this program has been </p><p>postponed until later this year because personnel </p><p>resources are needed elsewhere.  While Mission </p><p>understands there are other pressing needs </p><p>internationally, Mission requests that Department </p><p>continue to push hard for the implementation of the DoD- </p><p>run program as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Mission also requests that Washington examine </p><p>putting in place other demining programs, such as the </p><p>Mine Detection Dog Partnership Program proposed by the </p><p>Marshall Legacy Institute (MLI).  MLI President Perry </p><p>Baltimore recently visited Sri Lanka and discussed his </p><p>organization\'s proposed program with Mission, and </p><p>government and international organization </p><p>representatives.  MLI\'s proposal seemed extremely </p><p>sensible and was very well-received.  (Note:  Mission </p><p>has sent SA/INS a fax containing MLI\'s latest update on </p><p>its proposal.)  In addition to the MLI proposal, we </p><p>request that Department review other possible demining </p><p>programs that could be implemented in Sri Lanka in short </p><p>order -- and at least in the interim until the DoD-run </p><p>training program is up-and-running. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  We believe </p><p>strongly that demining reinforces our foreign and </p><p>humanitarian policy goals in Sri Lanka by providing </p><p>"quick impact" support for the peace process.  Along the </p><p>lines set out in Paras 6-7, we request that Department </p><p>initiate a bottom-up review of how the U.S. can re- </p><p>establish a presence in this key area ASAP.  We would </p><p>like to brief the GSL very soon on U.S. plans and would </p><p>appreciate a response on what is feasible by January 15. </p><p>END COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
