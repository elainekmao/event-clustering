<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XY, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: DES DIARRA ON TERRORISM AND A FEW ECOWAS </p><p>NOTES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 167569 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified - Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In the absence of ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Ambassador Kouyate, CDA Andrews, accompanied by Political </p><p>Counselor and PolMilOff, 27 September called on General </p><p>Chieck Diarra, Deputy Executive Secretary for Political </p><p>Affairs, Defense and Security at the ECOWAS Secretariat in </p><p>Abuja.  Andrews began by passing Diarra a response to </p><p>Ambassador Kouyate\'s letter of condolence.  Diarra thanked </p><p>Andrews, and, after reading the letter, informed us that </p><p>ECOWAS was planning an expert-level meeting in Accra in </p><p>October.  He indicated that EU Officials might be present. </p><p>The Executive Secretary planned to include the issue of </p><p>terrorism in the meeting, Diarra stated, as a part of the </p><p>discussion on crime in the sub-region.  Terrorism would also </p><p>be a main part of the ECOWAS plan of action for the year, </p><p>Diarra added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Andrews, noting that Diarra had anticipated the </p><p>point he was hoping to make, explained that while the U.S. </p><p>had received messages of condolence and offers of assistance, </p><p>we had not yet heard the type of statement from ECOWAS that </p><p>other sub-regional bodies, such as SADC, had made.  Diarra </p><p>said that terrorism was, "a concern of all humanity," and </p><p>stated that, "what happened in the U.S., I think, the whole </p><p>world was targeted."  He added, "We will be beside you in </p><p>this fight."  Diarra then explained further that after the </p><p>meeting in Accra at expert-level, terrorism would also be </p><p>discussed at the next ECOWAS Ministerial meeting, and at the </p><p>next ECOWAS Heads-of-State meeting, possibly in December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Andrews passed Diarra a matrix listing the ECOWAS </p><p>members-states and the status of ratification of each treaty </p><p>listed reftel, noting that the matrix was not definitive but </p><p>based on the best information held by the Embassy. (NOTE: </p><p>Embassy developed the matrix based on information listed in </p><p>the State Department document, "Treaties in Force, 1999."  A </p><p>copy of the matrix has been emailed to AF/W.  If other ECOWAS </p><p>Post\'s would like a copy of the matrix, please send an email </p><p>to kaplandm"at"state.gov.  END NOTE.)  Diarra thanked the CDA </p><p>and noted that the matrix would be useful for the discussions </p><p>in Accra. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ECOWAS NOTES: Diarra described the recent ACSS </p><p>Seminar in Accra as "wonderful," and stated he was looking </p><p>forward to his trip with Colonel Dikio to EUCOM.  When asked </p><p>about the status of the ECOWAS warehouse in Lagos, Diarra </p><p>said that while the decision on where to put the two ECOWAS </p><p>depots had not been made, he expected they would be put in </p><p>Burkina-Faso (or Mali) and Benin (or Togo).  Diarra noted </p><p>that, since Nigeria had offered temporary accommodation and </p><p>assistance for many ECOWAS bodies (such as the Parliament and </p><p>Court of Justice), these institutions were presently in </p><p>Nigeria.  However, he opined, it would be better to spread </p><p>ECOWAS institutions out among member states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: We were pleased with the response of </p><p>General Diarra on the subject of terrorism.  ECOWAS as an </p><p>institution is thin.  However, we expect that as formal </p><p>meetings occur, ECOWAS as an institution will make strong </p><p>public statements against terrorism.  Similar messages made </p><p>to other member states will have an important effect on </p><p>terrorism remaining in sharp focus during not only the expert </p><p>level meeting, but also the Ministerial and Summit meetings </p><p>that follow.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
