<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003201 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, SENV, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENDGAME ON GAS FLARING </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 2841 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Minister of State for the Environment Imeh </p><p>Okopido has enlisted the World Bank, the Government of Norway </p><p>and environmentalists from around the world to support his </p><p>position over the issue of gas flaring in Nigeria. </p><p>Okopido,s personal crusade is to advance the deadline to end </p><p>gas flaring from 2008 to 2004.  In this process, he has taken </p><p>on major petroleum companies and some GON heavyweights, in </p><p>particular Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Jackson Gaius-Obaseki.   The </p><p>former military government put forth the 2008 deadline in its </p><p>1997 economic plan &Vision 20108 and President Obasanjo </p><p>confirmed it during his 1999 election campaign.   Upon </p><p>entering the Ministry of the Environment in 1999, Okopido </p><p>announced that flaring should end sooner not later.  Okopido </p><p>is using Environmental Impact Assessments for exploration in </p><p>highly sought offshore plots to force competing firms to </p><p>submit plans to eliminate flaring by 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) While other major producers say they can fully or </p><p>substantially comply with the 2004 target, Shell Nigeria </p><p>insists that it may never totally eliminate flaring and that </p><p>90 per cent reduction is impracticable before 2008. </p><p>Supported by new overseas allies and confident that President </p><p>Obasanjo will eventually favor him, Okopido plans to continue </p><p>his offensive into next year,s World Summit on Sustainable </p><p>Development (WSSD) in South Africa. Okopido is organizing </p><p>Nigeria,s chairmanship of the Partnership Conference at the </p><p>Summit.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Preparing for the WSSD </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On November 19, visiting Regional Environmental </p><p>Officer Richard Hawkins and EconOff called on Minister of </p><p>State for the Environment Imeh Okopido to inquire about </p><p>Nigerian preparations for the WSSD.   Okopido explained that </p><p>Nigeria had two important roles: first as host of the Super </p><p>Preparatory Meeting in February of 2002, but also as the </p><p>chair of the Partnership Conference to be held during the </p><p>WSSD.   Okopido said that he was coordinating preparations </p><p>among 14 Ministries for the Summit, but that arrangements </p><p>were not proceeding well in South Africa.  Concerns over </p><p>funding were overshadowing preparations for the event itself. </p><p> "This may be our last chance to come up with and fund </p><p>projects that really will make a difference.  After the WSSD, </p><p>when will we have another opportunity to focus world </p><p>attention and donor interest?  Nigeria must play a major role </p><p>in getting ready," he stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Tempers aren,t the only things that flare </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) During the meeting, Okopido received a phone call from </p><p>his boss, Minister of the Environment Mohammed Kabir Said, </p><p>during which he launched into a discussion of Shell and the </p><p>NNPC.  After hanging up, he explained that during his stop </p><p>over in London, the oil companies had offered to give him </p><p>spending money for shopping.  He complained that too many in </p><p>the GON were swayed by such false generosity and tricked into </p><p>allowing the oil companies to mismanage national assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Okopido eagerly launched into a discussion of his </p><p>anti-flaring campaign.  He shared a copy of his November 8 </p><p>speech presented at the margins of the COP 7 in Marrakech, </p><p>and talked about the decision by the Government of Norway and </p><p>the World Bank to back a global campaign against gas flaring. </p><p> His points were: </p><p>--    Gas flaring represents only a small percentage of </p><p>greenhouse gases, but included many of the most damaging </p><p>ones, especially methane; </p><p>--    68 percent of Nigeria,s natural gas is now flared, </p><p>wasting a valuable national asset, damaging the local </p><p>ecosystem and endangering the global climate; </p><p>--    Nigerian flaring represents 19 percent of the world\'s </p><p>gas flaring with the rest of Africa accounting for another 19 </p><p>percent; </p><p>--    Most of the oil companies are ready to replace flaring </p><p>with collection and distribution in an accelerated way but </p><p>they need to be pressured; </p><p>--    The Obasanjo Administration needs to show the people of </p><p>the Niger Delta environmental dividends before the </p><p>re-election campaign in 2003; and </p><p>--    Shell Nigeria was the sole major producer fighting the </p><p>initiative. </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>International Assistance </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) Okopido had just returned from a conference on </p><p>Nigeria in Washington D.C., the COP 7 in Marrakech, and the </p><p>Global Anti-flaring Initiative Conference with the World Bank </p><p>and the Government of Norway in Oslo.  His first day in the </p><p>office in two weeks, he lamented how ignorant most of the </p><p>country and even his staff were about the environmental </p><p>movement.  &Here in Nigeria, they think our job is only </p><p>about rubbish removal.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Okopido asked the REO for $100,000 from the USG to </p><p>support the Super Prep Com to be led by President Obasanjo in </p><p>February 2002, and the Partnership Conference Nigeria chairs </p><p>at the WSSD. He stressed that, without identifying specific </p><p>goals and projects at the Super Prep Com, the WSSD would </p><p>become a diplomatic exercise without environmental or </p><p>development impact.   He also asked the Embassy for support </p><p>in training a team from his Ministry on constructing and </p><p>maintaining a web site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) After two weeks in Nigeria, Okopido said he would be </p><p>overseas again until just before Christmas.  He was </p><p>optimistic about the Global Anti-flaring Initiative and felt </p><p>that despite constant pressure from the NNPC and others </p><p>within the Government to keep the 2008 deadline, that the </p><p>2004 target would prevail.  "They (the oil companies) have </p><p>the technology, the capital and the long-term potential </p><p>profits to do it.  They will have to accelerate their capital </p><p>expenditures and make the environment in Africa a priority, </p><p>like it is in other parts of the world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: Political and Geological Realities </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) If the end of flaring is much closer than seemed </p><p>possible only a few years ago, much of the credit goes to the </p><p>multinationals, especially the U.S. companies who have </p><p>accelerated their plans for gas infrastructure investment. </p><p>Chevron,s role in the West African Gas Pipeline is just one </p><p>example.  Also noteworthy is the increasing use of gas </p><p>reinjection technology to enhance oil yields. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Shell, because of its extensive and widespread </p><p>on-shore fields, faces the biggest challenge.  Costs </p><p>associated with collecting the gas are high and further </p><p>complicated by pipeline vandalism.  Flaring will also be a </p><p>problem for the small indigenous firms bidding on the </p><p>marginal fields described in reftel.  To operate such small </p><p>fields safely and economically, they will almost certainly </p><p>need to flare.  Nigeria is, we have been reminded, "a gas </p><p>province, with associated oil." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) All of which does not change the political </p><p>significance of Okopido,s campaign.  His confrontational </p><p>style has alienated many colleagues in the Nigerian </p><p>government, and at times irked the President.  However, his </p><p>work has accelerated the decline in flaring.  His challenge </p><p>will be to convince the Government to sustain the pressure. </p><p>Rigorous anti-flaring programs run up against important </p><p>political and economic priorities like the marginal field </p><p>initiative, and could interfere with election-year demands </p><p>for more oil revenue in a down market.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
