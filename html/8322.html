DART Field Team North reports that there have been several </p><p>violent incidents in Kirkuk with reports of several deaths.  More </p><p>Kurds are returning to villages in the Makhmur region, and there </p><p>is little public infrastructure to support major influxes of </p><p>returnees.  WFP will begin receiving 136,000 MT of bulk wheat, in </p><p>5,000 MT increments, from stocks in Syria.  WFP has requested MOT </p><p>assistance in locating storage space for the wheat.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Two non-governmental organization (NGO) vehicles were </p><p>attacked on the Kirkuk to Baghdad road on 15 May.  In an apparent </p><p>act of banditry, shots were fired at one of the vehicles.  The </p><p>vehicle sustained damage, but no one was hurt. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Between 16 and 18 May, fighting between Arabs and Kurds took </p><p>place in Kirkuk.  The reasons are still unclear, but some suggest </p><p>that Ba\'ath loyalists attacked Kurds.  Several people were </p><p>injured or killed.  An incident over land issues in the Sinjara </p><p>area west of Mosul left one Arab dead.  Coalition forces arrested </p><p>the suspects. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Many Kurds who were forced out of their homes in past years </p><p>by the former regime are now trying to return to Kirkuk city. </p><p>Kirkuk epitomizes the ethnic mix and potential for conflict in </p><p>Iraq and how the return issue is addressed could have profound </p><p>effects on inter-ethnic relations in the region. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>RURAL WATER SECTOR MEETING </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Minister of Reconstruction and Development (MORAD) in </p><p>Arbil hosted a rural water sector meeting on 18 May.  In an </p><p>attempt to solicit assistance from the NGO and international </p><p>organization communities, the Ministry presented its 2003 plan to </p><p>implement 103 renovation projects and 112 new projects.  These </p><p>projects do not include proposed activities in the "newly </p><p>liberated" areas of southern Arbil Governorate. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DART VISIT TO MAKHMUR REGION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 19 May, DART Field Team North visited villages in southern </p><p>Arbil governorate.  The DART met with local villagers, newly </p><p>arrived returnees, and Coalition representatives responsible for </p><p>operations in the region. </p><p> </p><p>7.  More Kurds are returning to villages in the region, and there </p><p>is little public infrastructure to support major influxes of </p><p>returnees.  Water supply appears to be an issue, although in the </p><p>villages visited there were hand-dug wells that could be easily </p><p>cleaned to provide accessible water. </p><p>8.  Ethnic tensions are escalating in villages near the old </p><p>"green line".  Historically these villages had a mix of Kurds and </p><p>Arabs.  In the village of Shamamak, the DART met with Arabs who </p><p>said that on 17 May a local Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) </p><p>peshmerga commander from Gwer (who is actually from Shamamak) had </p><p>come to them with four armed men and told them they must leave </p><p>the village.  The Arabs fear that without Coalition intervention </p><p>in the next few days, they would have to move to Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The DART visited Coalition forces in Makhmur to discuss this </p><p>incident.  A Coalition source said the incident would be followed </p><p>up on.  He also said that this sort of incident was becoming </p><p>increasingly common. </p><p> </p><p>10.  At Grd Graw, near the border with Ninawa governorate, </p><p>Kurdish returnees informed the DART that water supplies, usually </p><p>piped from Haji Ali in Ninawa, had been disrupted.  They blamed </p><p>remaining Ba\'athists in that area for their lack of water.  The </p><p>DART has not confirmed whether there is indeed something sinister </p><p>causing the disruption of water supplies, or if there is a simple </p><p>mechanical problem.  The DART will follow up on this with </p><p>Coalition authorities in Makhmur. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The DART and a U.N. World Food Program (WFP) representative </p><p>met on 18 May with the manager of the Ninawa Grain Board in </p><p>Mosul.  The meeting was held to explain that WFP was going to </p><p>begin receiving 136,000 metric tons (MT) of bulk wheat, in 5,000 </p><p>MT increments, from stocks in Syria, and to request Ministry of </p><p>Trade (MOT) assistance in locating storage space for the wheat. </p><p>The manager assured WFP that he would meet with regional silo </p><p>managers to ensure space.  Storage space in Mosul is limited, but </p><p>regional silos are available to store some of the stock. </p><p>On a 19 May visit to Makhmur, the DART met a Kurd and two Arabs </p><p>who were surveying fields of wheat and barley.  They explained </p><p>that the Kurd, a doctor now practicing in Arbil, owned </p><p>approximately 1,000 dunam (1 dunam equals 2500 square feet) near </p><p>the village of Nogharan, and that the Arabs had each rented 120 </p><p>dunam from another Arab who had been given the land sometime in </p><p>the 1990s.  The doctor and the two Arabs were in the process of </p><p>agreeing how to split the harvest, this in accordance with a </p><p>recent edict from Mosul, Arbil, Makhmur, and Coalition </p><p>authorities.  The doctor was not pleased with the situation, </p><p>though he was relieved to be back on his land.  However, he was </p><p>committed to following the agreement to the letter.  The Arabs, </p><p>from Mosul, seemed happy to be receiving anything.  All in all, </p><p>the split appeared to be a good, short-term solution to bring the </p><p>harvest in successfully. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>DART-FUNDED NGO ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The International Rescue Committee (IRC) met with the DART </p><p>on 20 May and presented a concept paper for activities in </p><p>northern Iraq.  IRC staff then traveled to Baghdad to meet with </p><p>colleagues from southern Iraq to finalize implementation plans </p><p>that will be submitted in the coming days.  Possible activities </p><p>include waste collection, sewer network cleansing, and water </p><p>treatment plant repairs in the Kirkuk area. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The International Medical Corps is re-equipping and </p><p>renovating four health centers in Kirkuk that were looted </p><p>following the war. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Mercy Corps International (MCI) is providing short-term </p><p>assistance to the Directorate of Water and Sewerage in Kirkuk. </p><p>MCI will assist the Directorate with transportation for staff and </p><p>testing equipment.  MCI is also providing short-term emergency </p><p>assistance to the water treatment plant in Khaniqeen, Diyala </p><p>governorate, and they are also providing two emergency Health </p><p>Kits to health facilities in Tekef and Ain Sifni, near Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Save the Children (SCF) has several active projects in </p><p>Mosul.  They are providing transportation for health workers to </p><p>and from hospitals and primary health care centers; gasoline, </p><p>cooking gas, cleaning supplies and emergency repairs for Al </p><p>Khansa and Al Atheer hospitals; and supplies for supplementary </p><p>feeding programs at those two hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>IDPS AND LAND TENURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The DART visited a small camp for internally displaced </p><p>persons (IDPs) on the outskirts of Mosul where eleven families </p><p>have taken shelter near an abandoned Iraqi army base that is now </p><p>used by the Coalition.  While at the camp, the DART learned that </p><p>children had discovered unexploded ordnance while playing in a </p><p>nearby field.  Coalition forces were immediately notified, and </p><p>they promptly removed the ordnance. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Land tenure issues appear to be heating up with the </p><p>population perceiving little movement on this issue from the U.S. </p><p>Government.  An estimated eighty percent of the issues are </p><p>complex but not difficult if a date can be agreed to for the last </p><p>reasonable Iraqi law and if the registered land system has not </p><p>been tampered with, as indicated by most local leaders.  There </p><p>will be cases that will need to be worked out in the courts </p><p>and/or require the involvement of local traditional leaders. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Coalition forces in Mosul are involved in the sale of houses </p><p>(USD 1,000 per unit) in Domiz, which was previously Kurdish land. </p><p>The houses were built by the former regime.  The Coalition </p><p>objective is to have an integrated community with 200 Kurdish </p><p>families and 600 Arab families. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
