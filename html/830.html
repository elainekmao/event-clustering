<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LUANDA 001811 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF PDAS BUSHNELL AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  SOCI, KWMN, PHUM,  SADC, AO </p><p>SUBJECT:  STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION-- ANGOLA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 112270 AND PREVIOUS  B) LUANDA 0738 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  TWO DECADES OF CIVIL WAR HAVE WRECKED </p><p>FAMILY SUPPORT STRUCTURES IN ANGOLA, SEVERELY </p><p>UNDERMINING THE STATUS OF WOMEN.  WHILE ANGOLAN LAW </p><p>PROVIDES FOR THE FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT OF WOMEN, </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AND POOR TREATMENT PERSISTS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS.  THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE BEIJING WOMEN\'S </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUT DOUBTS REMAIN AS TO WHETHER LEGISLATION </p><p>MODELED ON THE BEIJING FORUM WILL ENSURE CONCRETE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE STATUS OF WOMEN.  POST WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PROMOTE WOMEN\'S RIGHTS AS A CROSS-CUTTING </p><p>OBJECTIVE THROUGH THE USE OF 116(E) FUNDING, DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND GOVERNANCE PROGRAMS, REPRESENTATIONAL EVENTS AND </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LOCAL ACTIVISTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ACCORDING TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GRA\'S STATE </p><p>SECRETARIAT FOR WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS AND THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN JURISTS, THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS </p><p>IN ANGOLAN LAW WHICH CAN BE CONSTRUED AS DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>AGAINST WOMEN.  GENDER EQUALITY WAS ENSHRINED IN </p><p>ANGOLA\'S 1975 POST-INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTION AND </p><p>REMAINS IN FORCE UNDER THE LAW.  WOMEN HAVE FULL </p><p>POLITICAL RIGHTS, AND THERE ARE THREE WOMEN MINISTERS: </p><p>PETROLEUM, FISHERIES AND CULTURE (THIS REPRESENTS JUST </p><p>13 PERCENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS).  WOMEN MAY </p><p>THE RANK OF SUB-COMMISSIONER (MAJOR GENERAL) IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE.  WOMEN FIGURE PROMINENTLY THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN LUANDA AND OTHER LARGER, </p><p>EUROPEAN-INFLUENCED ANGOLAN CITIES.  HOWEVER, ANGOLAN </p><p>WOMEN LEADERS, JUST LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WANT TO SEE MORE WOMEN IN </p><p>POSITIONS OF POWER AND AUTHORITY IN THE RULING MPLA, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BY CONTRAST, IN RURAL AREAS SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCES </p><p>EXIST BETWEEN THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY AND </p><p>CUSTOMARY PRACTICE.  ACCORDING TO GENOVEVA POLICARPO, </p><p>THE STATE SECRETARIAT FOR WOMEN\'S DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, CUSTOMARY LAW WITH REGARD TO </p><p>WOMEN\'S STATUS REMAINS IN FORCE THROUGHOUT RURAL </p><p>ANGOLA.  UNDER THESE PRACTICES, SHE SAYS, WOMEN ARE </p><p>BARRED FROM INHERITING PROPERTY AND ARE OFTEN COMPELLED </p><p>BY THEIR HUSBANDS TO PERFORM STRENUOUS FARM LABOR. </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN ANGOLA, FEMALE ADULTERY HAS BEEN </p><p>PUNISHED BY DEATH WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT </p><p>MEN ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE MULTIPLE SEXUAL PARTNERS AFTER </p><p>MARRIAGE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN THE FEW AREAS OF RURAL ANGOLA WITH FUNCTIONING </p><p>COURTS OF LAW, WOMEN ARE GENERALLY DENIED ACCESS TO THE </p><p>JUDICIAL PROCESS TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES AGAINST MEN. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE GRA PLANS A SEPTEMBER SEMINAR TO ADDRESS </p><p>DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CUSTOMARY PRACTICE AND THE LEGAL </p><p>CODE, TRADITION GENERALLY WINS OVER LAW BY DEFAULT-- </p><p>THE ANGOLAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY WEAK, AND </p><p>TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES (AND NORMS) HAVE FILLED THE GAP </p><p>LEFT BY THE ABSENCE OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL COURTS.  THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE EXTENSION OF THE </p><p>REACH OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO EVERY CORNER OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY WILL BE AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO THE GRA, WITH </p><p>THE HELP OF THE USG AND THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BOTH POLICARPO AND WOMEN\'S JURISTS ASSOCIATION </p><p>PRESIDENT GRACA LOPES NOTE THAT TWO DECADES OF CIVIL </p><p>WAR HAVE ALSO PLACED CONSIDERABLE STRAIN ON THE STATUS </p><p>OF URBAN WOMEN, PARTICULARLY IN THE OVERCROWDED LUANDA </p><p>SHANTYTOWNS.  LOPES REPORTS THAT RAPE AND SPOUSAL ABUSE </p><p>ARE REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AS MEN VENT THEIR </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS OVER DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>CONDITIONS AT WOMEN.  PROSTITUTION IS RAMPANT IN THE </p><p>SHANTYTOWNS AND THE USE OF CHILD PROSTITUTES APPEARS </p><p>WIDESPREAD AMONG UPPER-CLASS ANGOLANS AND SOME </p><p>EXPATRIATES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE STATE SECRETARIAT FOR WOMEN HAS PREPARED A </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THEMES RAISED AT </p><p>THE BEIJING WOMEN\'S CONFERENCE.  ACCORDING TO STATE </p><p>SECRETARY JOANA LINA, THE PROPOSAL IS "EXTREMELY </p><p>FAITHFUL" TO THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED IN </p><p>BEIJING.  THE MEASURE IS AWAITING APPROVAL BY THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, WHICH HAS NOT MET IN OVER SIX </p><p>WEEKS AND WHOSE WORK MAY BE FURTHER SLOWED BY LAST </p><p>WEEK\'S PARTIAL CABINET SHAKEUP.  WE ARE RAISING WITH </p><p>SENIOR CABINET OFFICIALS THE NEED TO PUSH THIS AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  OUR EMBASSY TAKES AN ACTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTION OF </p><p>WOMEN\'S ISSUES IN ANGOLA.  WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>OUR AID MISSION EARLIER THIS YEAR AND OUR ACCESS FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME TO DFA FUNDING, WE ARE WORKING WITH </p><p>AID PROJECT DESIGN TEAMS TO ENSURE THAT PROMOTION OF </p><p>WOMEN IS A CROSS-CUTTING TOP PRIORITY OF ALL OUR </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE, RURAL REHABILITATION, AND </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  SPECIFIC </p><p>GRANTS UNDER THE DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND AND </p><p>THE SELF-HELP PROGRAM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR </p><p>ENHANCING THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN SOCIETY.  TWO OF OUR </p><p>THREE GRANTEES FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL VISITORS </p><p>PROGRAM TO PROMOTE CIVIL SOCIETY ARE WOMEN, AND WE </p><p>HAVE ESTABLISHED A FULL PARITY POLICY FOR ALL FUTURE </p><p>USIA IV AND SPEAKERS PROGRAMS.  WE HAVE ALSO </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED WOMEN\'S ISSUES THROUGH OUR PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY.  AMBASSADOR AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS </p><p>HAVE SPOKEN OUT AT HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCES ON THE </p><p>CONTINUING PHYSICAL ABUSE OF WOMEN AND THEIR </p><p>EXCLUSION FROM FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AND POLITICAL LIFE OF ANGOLA.  OUR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>REPORT, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THIS AREA, HAS BEEN </p><p>FREQUENTLY QUOTED BY LOCAL WOMEN\'S RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. </p><p>WE HAVE SPONSORED REPRESENTATIONAL FUNCTIONS </p><p>STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN IN SOCIETY, SUCH </p><p>AS A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED ROUNDTABLE ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>WOMEN\'S DAY AT WHICH WOMEN FROM POLITICS, BUSINESS, </p><p>MEDIA, AND OTHER SECTORS MET TO DISCUSS WOMEN\'S </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STEINBERG </p><p></p></div>
