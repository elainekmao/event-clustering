A MODEST RESTRUCTURING OF THE </p><p>MILITARY HIERARCHY IS ALSO IN THE WORKS, WITH EASTERN </p><p>REGIONAL COMMANDER MAUNG AYE SLATED TO FILL THE </p><p>JUNTA\'S NOMINAL NUMBER TWO POSITION.  INTELLIGENCE </p><p>CHIEF KHIN NYUNT WILL GET A SOMEWHAT FANCIER TITLE AND </p><p>WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO CALL MOST OF THE SHOTS.  IN </p><p>OTHER ARMED FORCES DAY DEVELOPMENTS, THOUGH CHIEF OF </p><p>STATE THAN SHWE\'S SPEECH WAS LESS STRIDENT THAN </p><p>SIMILAR MESSAGES BY HIS PREDECESSOR, IT GAVE NO HINT </p><p>OF COMPROMISE ON THE MILITARY\'S DEMAND FOR A LEADING </p><p>ROLE IN BURMA\'S FUTURE POLITICAL SYSTEM.  IN KEEPING </p><p>WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCE FROM PUBLIC VIEW SINCE BEING </p><p>REPLACED LAST YEAR, FORMER SLORC CHAIRMAN SAW MAUNG\'S </p><p>HISTORICAL ROLE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM THE MAN WHO </p><p>"SAVED BURMA" TO THAT OF A NON-PERSON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  CAREFUL OBSERVERS OF THE BURMESE OFFICIAL </p><p>MEDIA LEARNED THIS WEEK THAT A NUMBER OF TOP MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS WERE PROMOTED ON THE MARCH 27 ARMED FORCES </p><p>DAY HOLIDAY (REFS A AND B).  NONE OF THE CHANGES WAS </p><p>SPECIFICALLY ANNOUNCED, BUT REPORTS ON THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES DAY CEREMONIES INCLUDE NEW TITLES WHICH CONFIRM </p><p>THAT AT LEAST TWELVE MAJOR GENERALS WERE ELEVATED TO </p><p>THE THREE-STAR LIEUTENANT GENERAL RANK.  AMONG THOSE </p><p>PROMOTED WERE THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SLORC MEMBERS, ALL </p><p>OF WHOM HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS FROM POSITIONS AS REGIONAL MILITARY COMMANDERS </p><p>TO TOP JOBS IN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES: </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF BORDER AREAS AND </p><p>NATIONAL RACES MAUNG THINT (FORMERLY NORTHEAST </p><p>REGIONAL COMMANDER); </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF LABOR AYE THOUNG (FORMERLY SOUTHERN </p><p>COMMANDER) ; </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF MINES KYAW MIN (NORTHWESTERN COMMAND); </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF HOTELS AND TOURISM KYAW BA (NORTHERN </p><p>COMMAND) ; </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF TRADE TUN KYI (CENTRAL COMMAND); </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND DEFENSE SERVICES </p><p>ADJUTANT GENERAL MYINT AUNG (SOUTHEASTERN COMMAND); </p><p>AND </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS MYA THINN (WESTERN </p><p>COMMAND) . </p><p> </p><p>RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER MYO NYUNT WAS ALSO PROMOTED </p><p>FROM MAJOR GENERAL TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL, THOUGH HE </p><p>RETAINS HIS POST AS RANGOON REGIONAL COMMANDER FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FOUR OTHER MAJOR GENERALS WERE PROMOTED TO </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND WILL SOON BE GIVEN NEW POSTS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES: </p><p> </p><p>-- EASTERN REGIONAL COMMANDER MAUNG AYE WILL BECOME </p><p>THE NOMINAL "NUMBER TWO" IN THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, </p><p>FILLING A VACANCY THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE GENERAL THAN </p><p>SHWE REPLACED SENIOR GENERAL SAW MAUNG AS SLORC </p><p>CHAIRMAN AND DEFENSE SERVICES COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF </p><p>ALMOST A YEAR AGO.  MOST SOURCES BELIEVE THAT MAUNG </p><p>AYE WILL SOON BECOME DEPUTY CINC OF THE DEFENSE </p><p>SERVICES (TATMADAW) BUT REMAIN UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE </p><p>WILL ALSO MOVE INTO THE VACANT ARMY CINC AND/OR SLORC </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMANSHIP POSITIONS.  THAN SHWE HAD OCCUPIED </p><p>THESE POSTS CONCURRENTLY WITH THE NUMBER TWO </p><p>"TATMADAW" SLOT. </p><p> </p><p>-- POWERFUL MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT </p><p>WILL REPORTEDLY MOVE INTO A NEWLY CREATED THREE-STAR </p><p>POSITION AS DIRECTOR OF "STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE" </p><p>(SOURCES ARE UNSURE OF THE PRECISE TITLE) WHILE </p><p>RETAINING HIS POSITION AS SLORC SECRETARY-1.  HE MAY </p><p>GIVE UP THE FORMAL DESIGNATION AS DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE </p><p>SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (DDSI) BUT HIS NEW, BROADER </p><p>DUTIES WILL INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF DDSI AS WELL AS ALL </p><p>OTHER MILITARY AND CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- TIN 00 WILL KEEP HIS JOB AS SLORC SECRETARY-2 WHILE </p><p>MOVING FROM ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TO HEAD ONE OF THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S TWO BUREAUX OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS (BSO-I). </p><p>HE REPLACES LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND MINISTER OF </p><p>INDUSTRY-1 SEIN AUNG IN THIS POSITION, RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>COORDINATING ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN UPPER BURMA. </p><p> </p><p>-- MILITARY APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY MAUNG HLA WILL </p><p>REPLACE LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND FORESTRY MINISTER CHIT </p><p>SWE AS HEAD OF THE OTHER SPECIAL OPERATIONS BUREAU </p><p>(BSO-II), RESPONSIBLE FOR LOWER BURMA MILITARY ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (LOU)  CHIEF OF STATE THAN SHWE DELIVERED THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY ADDRESS FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>TATMADAW\'S HISTORY IN THE STRUGGLES AGAINST </p><p>IMPERIALISM, FASCISM, AND INTERNAL INSURGENCY (REF C). </p><p>THE SPEECH WAS LESS HARD-LINE THAN THOSE GIVEN BY SAW </p><p>MAUNG ON THIS OCCASION IN RECENT YEARS, OMITTING </p><p>HOSTILE REFERENCES TO THE BRITISH AND JAPANESE WHICH </p><p>HAD RILED THOSE NATIONS\' DEFENSE ATTACHES.  THAN SHWE </p><p>SHOWED NO SIGN OF COMPROMISING ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUES, HOWEVER:  WHILE HE REPEATED THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>STANDARD PROMISE TO TRANSFER POWER AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, HE INSISTED THAT THE TATMADAW MUST PLAY A </p><p>LEADING ROLE IN BURMA\'S FUTURE POLITICAL SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (LOU)  ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH ARMED FORCES DAY, </p><p>THE GOB PUBLISHED SPECIAL NEWSPAPER SUPPLEMENTS AND </p><p>ORGANIZED AN EXHIBIT ON THE HISTORY OF THE TATMADAW </p><p>AND ITS LEADING PERSONALITIES.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS </p><p>NOTED THE STARK CONTRAST WITH THE TENOR OF LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>COMMEMORATION, WHICH FEATURED GUSHING TRIBUTES TO THE </p><p>MILITARY CAREER OF SLORC CHAIRMAN SAW MAUNG.  THIS </p><p>YEAR THERE WERE NOTABLE GAPS WHERE THERE HAD ONCE BEEN </p><p>REFERENCES TO THE EX-CHIEF OF STATE.  WHILE FORMER </p><p>DICTATOR NE WIN STILL FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THE </p><p>TATMADAW\'S HISTORY, SAW MAUNG -- THE MAN WHO ONCE </p><p>CLAIMED HE HAD "SAVED BURMA" -- HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A </p><p>NON-PERSON. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  COMMENT:  THIS YEAR\'S ARMED FORCES DAY </p><p>PROMOTIONS APPEAR TO SIGNAL STABILITY RATHER THAN </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITHIN BURMA\'S RULING CIRCLE. </p><p>SEVERAL OF THE RECENTLY APPOINTED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS </p><p>-- SUCH AS TUN KYI, KYAW BA, AND KYAW MIN -- WERE </p><p>PROBABLY GIVEN THEIR THIRD STARS AS BELATED PAY-OFFS </p><p>FOR THEIR EARLIER AGREEMENT (UNDER PRESSURE) TO GIVE </p><p>UP LUCRATIVE POSITIONS AS REGIONAL COMMANDERS. </p><p>PROMOTING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SLORC\'S MAJOR GENERALS </p><p>ALSO EASED THE WAY FOR KHIN NYUNT\'S OWN ELEVATION TO </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL:  ELEVATING THE RELATIVELY JUNIOR </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ALIENATED </p><p>THOSE WITH GREATER MILITARY SENIORITY.  WHILE WE </p><p>ASSUME HE WILL SHOW DUE RESPECT FOR THE COMMANDING </p><p>ROLES OF THAN SHWE AND NOW MAUNG AYE, WE WOULD STILL </p><p>EXPECT KHIN NYUNT TO CALL THE SHOTS ON MOST DOMESTIC </p><p>AND FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.  WHATEVER HIS NEW FORMAL </p><p>TITLE, THIS WILL BE LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE ROLE HE </p><p>FIRMLY OCCUPIES AS POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND </p><p>DECISION-MAKER ON ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>JAMESON </p><p></p></div>
