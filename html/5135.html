O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe Industry Appeals for Relief </p><p> </p><p>Ref: 02 Harare 2821 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  In rare unison, Zimbabwean </p><p>industrialists have urged the GOZ to abandon its </p><p>impractical economic policies.  The situation is critical </p><p>enough that one firm is actually cautioning investors to </p><p>avoid its shares.  It is unclear whether President Mugabe </p><p>will heed the industrialists\' call.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The productive sector has urgently advocated </p><p>devaluation of the official exchange rate and relaxation </p><p>of government intervention in the economy.  Meeting most </p><p>recently with Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa on January </p><p>14, 50 of Zimbabwe\'s most prominent businessmen stressed </p><p>that they are faced with only two options at this point - </p><p>- bankruptcy or the black market.  They believe there is </p><p>no way for most businesses to survive while adhering to </p><p>2003 budget\'s draconian constraints (ref).  The </p><p>Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) and several </p><p>industry groups had already submitted a plan in writing </p><p>to the Finance Ministry and Reserve Bank calling for </p><p>market-friendly solutions but couched in the most non- </p><p>threatening tone. </p><p> </p><p>Will He Listen? </p><p>--------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The question, of course, is whether these pleas </p><p>will resonate with President Mugabe.  Opinions differ. </p><p>Barbican (a commercial bank) CEO Mthuli Ncube is </p><p>skeptical, noting that Mugabe and his inner circle still </p><p>believe they are at war with the United Kingdom and </p><p>cannot budge on ideological principles.  Ncube considers </p><p>Murerwa a powerless Finance Minister.  In contrast, PG </p><p>Industries (a glass manufacturer and exporter to the </p><p>U.S.) CEO Gerald Mujaji feels Mugabe may finally </p><p>appreciate industry\'s dire predicament.  Mujaji believes </p><p>Mugabe may feel less threatened by a weakened opposition </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and compromise on </p><p>devaluation for certain sectors.  The CEO also hopes </p><p>Mugabe will realize that many black-owned businesses are </p><p>at risk. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Many industrialists are unwilling to return to </p><p>pre-Christmas production levels, only to operate at </p><p>losses.  Those that make a profit will do so by flaunting </p><p>the law, a line many businesses still do not want to </p><p>cross.  How futile is their plight?  Consider mining firm </p><p>Rio Tinto, which has been running ads in local papers </p><p>cautioning shareholders that "recent monetary policy </p><p>directives have rendered the company unviable." Until the </p><p>GOZ alters its policies, Rio Tinto\'s directorate </p><p>officially discourages "dealing in the company\'s shares." </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
