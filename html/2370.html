YUDHOYONO\'S REMARKS REVEALED THAT THE GOI\'S </p><p>PLANS FOR ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATIONS AIM PRIMARILY AT </p><p>SEPARATISM IN ACEH AND PAPUA AND INTERCOMMUNAL CONFLICT IN </p><p>SULAWESI AND THE MOLUCCAS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) CHARGE MET JANUARY 9 WITH COORDINATING MINISTER FOR </p><p>POLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO, AT </p><p>YUDHOYONO\'S REQUEST, TO DISCUSS ANTI-TERRORISM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL SPACE TO ACT FIRMLY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH" AND "THE TIME </p><p>HAS COME TO ACT FIRMLY" AGAINST MUSLIM EXTREMISTS AND OTHERS </p><p>WHO ENGAGE IN TERRORISM OR THREATEN PUBLIC ORDER.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HE SAID HAD TAKE A TOUGH LINE AGAINST INTERCOMMUNAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN SULAWESI.  THE POLICE AND MILITARY HAVE DEPLOYED </p><p>FIVE BATTALIONS TO CENTRAL SULAWESI AND HAVE BEGUN DISARMING </p><p>AND EVENTUALLY "REPATRIATING" OUTSIDE EXTREMISTS LIKE LASKAR </p><p>JIHAD.  YUDHOYONO PLANS A TRIP TO AMBON, MALUKU NEXT WEEK TO </p><p>HELP ADDRESS INTERCOMMUNAL TENSIONS THERE AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) YUDHOYONO, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A ONE-DAY TRIP </p><p>TO SINGAPORE, SAID SENIOR SINGAPOREAN OFFICIALS WERE APPALLED </p><p>BY INDONESIAN MUSLIM LEADERS\' CALLING ON THE GOI TO REFRAIN </p><p>FROM MOVING AGAINST LOCAL MILITANTS LINKED TO THE TERRORISTS </p><p>RECENTLY ARRESTED IN SINGAPORE.  YUDHOYONO HAD REASSURED DPM </p><p>TONY TAN AND SENIOR MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW THAT SUCH REMARKS </p><p>DID NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF MOST INDONESIANS OR EVEN MOST </p><p>INDONESIAN MUSLIMS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT </p><p>FOR MUSLIM EXTREMISTS HAS IN FACT WEAKENED GREATLY IN THE </p><p>LAST FEW MONTHS SINCE IT PEAKED WHEN U.S.-LED MILITARY ACTION </p><p>COMMENCED IN AFGHANISTAN.  YUDHOYONO BELIEVES THAT THE GOI </p><p>NOW HAS THE POLITICAL SPACE TO ACT AGAINST MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. </p><p> HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT MEGAWATI, VICE PRESIDENT HAMZAH HAZ, </p><p>AND PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS WILL NOW SUPPORT TOUGH MEASURES </p><p>AGAINST ANYONE, INCLUDING RADICAL MUSLIMS, WHO THREATENS </p><p>PUBLIC ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT LAST WEEK HE HAD CHAIRED AN </p><p>INTERAGENCY MEETING TO REVIEW THE CAPABILITIES OF THE POLICE </p><p>AND MILITARY TO ACT AGAINST INTERNAL SECURITY THREATS AND </p><p>TERRORISTS.  HE SAID THE MILITARY CANNOT CURRENTLY ADDRESS </p><p>ADEQUATELY INTERNAL THREATS FROM "TERRORISTS" IN POSO, AMBON, </p><p>AND ACEH.  HE SAID THAT, FOR ITS PART, THE GOI NEEDS TO </p><p>"PROPERLY ALLOCATE" RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE REAL NEEDS OF </p><p>THE MILITARY.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE ALSO PLANS TO ASK FOR </p><p>"CONCRETE SUPPORT" FROM THE U.S.  THOUGH HE PREVIEWED HIS </p><p>PLANS FOR US, HE EMPHASIZED THAT HE WAS STILL AWAITING </p><p>APPROVAL FROM PRESIDENT MEGAWATI AND VICE PRESIDENT HAMZAH </p><p>HAZ BEFORE MAKING A FORMAL APPROACH.  YUDHOYONO DID NOT </p><p>DISCUSS SPECIFICS EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT THE INDONESIAN MILITARY </p><p>FACED SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF "MOBILITY."  (ON THE MARGINS OF THE </p><p>MEETING, YUDHOYONO\'S DEPUTY MENTIONED HELICOPTERS AND </p><p>TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.) </p><p> </p><p>NEW LEGISLATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN RESPONSE TO YUDHOYONO\'S FEELER, THE CHARGE NOTED </p><p>THAT RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>DEFENSE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN MILITARIES FOR </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF HELP FOR INDONESIA. </p><p>WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS, THE CHARGE SAID THAT ANY </p><p>ASSISTANCE RENDERED TO INDONESIA WOULD PROBABLY BE USED FOR </p><p>TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN EQUIPMENT.  THE </p><p>CHARGE ALSO NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD REPEALED THE </p><p>PROHIBITION ON COMMERCIAL SALES OF NON-LETHAL MILITARY ITEMS, </p><p>BROADLY UNDERSTOOD.  WE COULD NOT PROVIDE FINANCING OR CREDIT </p><p>FOR THESE COMMERCIAL PURCHASES, HOWEVER.  WE HAD ALREADY </p><p>OFFERED SEVERAL TIMES TO REVIEW AN INDONESIAN WISH LIST IN </p><p>ADVANCE AND INDICATE WHAT SPECIFIC ITEMS WE WOULD BE WILLING </p><p>TO AUTHORIZE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. </p><p> </p><p>BETTER MILITARY TIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE HOPED FOR GENERALLY BETTER </p><p>MILITARY-MILITARY TIES.  HE ASKED RHETORICALLY EXACTLY WHAT </p><p>THE U.S. HOPED TO ACHIEVE BY LIMITING MILITARY TIES. </p><p>INDONESIA, YUDHOYONO SAID, NEEDED A ROBUST MILITARY TO SOLVE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL THREATS TO SOVEREIGNTY IN IRIAN JAYA AND ACEH, AS </p><p>WELL AS INTERCOMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL SULAWESI AND THE </p><p>MOLUCCAS.  WITHOUT A CAPABLE MILITARY, INDONESIA WOULD NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO COMBAT TERRORISM EFFECTIVELY AND WOULD FACE A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO ITS NATIONAL INTEGRITY.  THE CHARGE </p><p>REPLIED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD YUDHOYONO\'S FRUSTRATION AND SAID </p><p>THAT THE U.S. WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH A FRIENDLY MILITARY </p><p>THAT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND WAS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ABUSES. </p><p>THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSISTANCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM MIGHT NOT BE ALL THAT YUDHOYONO HOPED FOR, IT WAS A </p><p>GOOD START.  YUDHOYONO HOPED THE CONVENING OF THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS TRIBUNAL "NEXT MONTH" WOULD ADDRESS U.S. CONCERNS OVER </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY. (NOTE: THE CONVENING OF THE </p><p>TRIBUNAL IS PUBLICLY SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 15, BUT THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN MANY RUMORS OF A POSTPONEMENT. END NOTE.) HE STRESSED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IMPLEMENTING ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD TAKE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>WOLFOWITZ REMARKS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) YUDHOYONO ASKED THE CHARGE FOR CLARIFICATION OF </p><p>REPORTED REMARKS BY DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WOLFOWITZ </p><p>THAT INDONESIA MAY BECOME ONE OF THE NEXT THEATERS OF ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST AL-QAEDA.  HE SAID "YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ME, </p><p>BUT I NEED TO EXPLAIN TO PRESIDENT MEGAWATI AND TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT."  UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH REMARKS, WHICH YUDHOYONO </p><p>SAID HE PERSONALLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE PROPER CONTEXT, ARE </p><p>EASILY DISTORTED BY ISLAMIST CRITICS INTO ACCUSATIONS THAT </p><p>THE U.S. PLANS TO ATTACK INDONESIA.  THE CHARGE REPLIED THAT </p><p>WOLFOWITZ\'S PUBLIC REMARKS HAVE BEEN NEARLY IDENTICAL TO OUR </p><p>PRIVATE MESSAGE TO THE GOI.  WE HAVE NATURAL CONCERNS THAT </p><p>INDONESIA, AS A LARGE, OPEN COUNTRY, COULD BE VULNERABLE TO </p><p>INFILTRATION BY AL-QAEDA OR OTHER TERRORISTS.  WE WANT TO </p><p>WORK WITH THE GOI TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM, BUT WE </p><p>HAVE NO PLANS FOR UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST </p><p>INDONESIA.  TOO OFTEN, THE CHARGE SAID, THE PRESS DISTORTED </p><p>OUR CONSISTENT MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: WHAT\'S THE REAL TARGET? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) INDONESIA DOES FACE SERIOUS LOGISTICS CHALLENGES THAT </p><p>IMPEDE EFFECTIVE EFFORTS TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERROR. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE DOUBT THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT IS THE GOI\'S </p><p>PRIMARY CONCERN-EVEN IN THE WAKE OF RECENT ARRESTS IN THE </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  YUDHOYONO\'S REMARKS MADE CLEAR THAT </p><p>THE GOI\'S CONCEPTION OF THE TERRORIST THREAT DIFFERS FROM THE </p><p>U.S. CONCERN WITH INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS LIKE AL-QAEDA. </p><p>YUDHOYONO BARELY MENTIONED INTERNATIONAL OR FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORISM, RESERVING HIS REMARKS MAINLY FOR SEPARATISTS IN </p><p>ACEH AND IRIAN JAYA AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE INTERCOMMUNAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN SULAWESI AND THE MOLUCCAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MULL </p><p></p></div>
