<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "What next after mass action?" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>      June 5 editorial to challenging the leadership of </p><p>      the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>      to "come up with an imaginative and focused plan </p><p>      that can save Zimbabwe" from the current </p><p>      socioeconomic and political tragedy.  The call comes </p><p>      in the wake of a week-long strike called by the MDC </p><p>      that has successfully shut commerce and industry </p><p>      during the last three days, despite government </p><p>      threats to punish companies that failed to open. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Zimbabweans, who stayed away from work this week to </p><p>      demonstrate their anger at the government\'s </p><p>      mismanagement of the country, will wake up next </p><p>      Monday to find themselves facing exactly the same </p><p>      problems which have killed their nation. . .But most </p><p>      significantly, President Robert Mugabe will not have </p><p>      resigned or conceded that he has failed to run </p><p>      Zimbabwe and agreed to negotiations with the MDC, </p><p>      the stated objectives of the opposition party\'s mass </p><p>      action.  If anything, Zimbabweans can expect Mugabe </p><p>      terrified into action by the huge success of this </p><p>      week\'s stayaway to come out fighting to shore up his </p><p>      tottering regime.  Having called upon Zimbabweans to </p><p>      make the sacrifices that they made this week, with </p><p>      many arrested or beaten up in public by State </p><p>      security agents, we ask MDC leader Morgan </p><p>      Tsvangirai: what next now?  Does the opposition </p><p>      party. . .have any alternative and viable plan </p><p>      beyond mere mass stayaways to free Zimbabweans from </p><p>      this dictatorship. . .?  In as much as the mass </p><p>      action this week is a sign that the government has </p><p>      run out of options beyond brute military force, it </p><p>      is also a wake-up call to Tsvangirai and the MDC to </p><p>      strategize beyond stayaways and to always have an </p><p>      alternative plan should the first one be thwarted by </p><p>      the besieged government. . .The opposition party </p><p>      must rapidly get its act together and come up with </p><p>      an imaginative and focused plan that can save </p><p>      Zimbabwe now and not to prolong the crisis. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
