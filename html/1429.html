<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008413 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, EAID, CG, UNHCR </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEE ISSUES IN GOMA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KIGALI 3122 </p><p>     B. KIGALI RW 3516 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During her Nov. 26-Dec 1 visit to Goma, </p><p>Econoff discussed refugee issues with Eddie O\'Dwyer, UNHCR\'s </p><p>Acting Head of Field Office in Goma, and with Kasuku, a </p><p>member of a Congolese NGO involved in repatriating Congolese </p><p>Tutsis.  O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR and the Governor of North </p><p>Kivu had overcome mutual distrust to implement a unique </p><p>cooperative program to facilitate the return of refugees to </p><p>Rwanda.  These flows amount to about 1500 per month.  O\'Dwyer </p><p>said UNHCR was playing no role in the return of Congolese </p><p>refugees.  Kasuku said that thousands of Congolese Tutsi\'s </p><p>returning from Rwanda were desperately in need of </p><p>international assistance.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On November 28 Econoff met with Eddie O\'Dwyer, </p><p>UNHCR\'s Head of Field Office (Acting) for Goma.  O\'Dwyer </p><p>explained that UNHCR had returned to the DRC in May of 1999 </p><p>with three missions: to repatriate willing Rwandan refugees; </p><p>to reactivate tripartite cooperation with the DRC and Burundi </p><p>to facilitate the repatriation of Burundian refugees; and to </p><p>facilitate individual Congolese repatriations.  The climate </p><p>at the time was one of mutual suspicion.  UNHCR feared that </p><p>Rwandan Hutus were being forced out of Congo against their </p><p>will.  The North Kivu authorities blamed the UNHCR in part </p><p>for the disastrous consequences of the arrival in Congo of </p><p>Rwandan refugees following the 1994 Rwandan genocide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In the absence of UNHCR, the Governor of North Kivu </p><p>was responsible for the refugee issue, and his office had </p><p>based its operations on the premise that all the Rwandan and </p><p>Burundian refugees in Congo needed to go home.  In October </p><p>1998 the North Kivu authorities began a sensitization </p><p>campaign to encourage voluntary repatriation.  When that </p><p>didn\'t work, according to O\'Dwyer, the Congolese in February </p><p>1999 began rounding up Rwandan hutus and sending them home. </p><p>Between February and July 1999, over 13,000 Rwandans were </p><p>repatriated.  After lengthy discussions, UNHCR began </p><p>providing limited logistical support to the repatriation </p><p>campaign in July 1999, in exchange for an opportunity to </p><p>interview refugees and confirm that they were returning </p><p>voluntarily.  In December 1999 this evolved into a formal </p><p>partnership agreement.  O\'Dwyer said that 20 UNHCR staff </p><p>members worked in the field with 80 employees from the </p><p>Governor\'s office to coordinate assembly and transportation </p><p>of refugees.  Since July 1999, on average, 1500 Rwandans have </p><p>voluntarily returned home each month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Rwandan refugee caseload is a moving target. </p><p>O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR had estimated that there were some </p><p>40,000 Rwandan refugees in North Kivu in May 1999.  Today, </p><p>despite 37,000 repatriations, UNHCR estimates that about </p><p>40,000 Rwandan refugees remain in North Kivu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) O\'Dwyer said that most skirmishes between Interhamwe </p><p>and RCD/RPA forces lead to the "liberation" of groups of </p><p>refugees.  O\'Dwyer is convinced that these populations, while </p><p>not precisely held hostage by the Interhamwe, are being </p><p>intimidated into remaining in the Congo.  A journalist who </p><p>visited a refugee processing station in December 2000 told </p><p>Econoff that she met with a group of these refugees who had </p><p>recently gained the liberty to make their way to the UNHCR </p><p>site.  She described them as physically and emotionally </p><p>exhausted, and she characterized their experience in Congo as </p><p>a life of slave labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On November 27, Econoff met with Kasuku, Vice </p><p>President of the local Chamber of Commerce and member of the </p><p>NGO most active in repatriating Congolese Tutsi\'s from </p><p>Rwanda, "Tout Pour le Developpement" (Ref A).  Kasuku was </p><p>once the head of the North Kivu cattlemen\'s association, but </p><p>he and all his fellow ranchers lost their livelihoods when </p><p>the Masisi cattle herds were slain in the years following the </p><p>arrival of the Rwandan refugees.  He said the Congolese </p><p>refugees in Rwanda wanted to come home, but both the GOR and </p><p>the UNHCR were holding them back.  He said Caritas and </p><p>another NGO provide limited support, but Congolese Tutsi </p><p>returnees desperately need more assistance.  Kasuku claimed </p><p>that 8000 more Congolese who had recently returned from </p><p>Rwanda had nothing to eat, and pleaded for USG assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Econoff asked O\'Dwyer about TPD and reports that </p><p>pecuniary motives underlay the NGO\'s effort to repatriate </p><p>Congolese refugees (Ref A).  O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR\'s </p><p>official policy is that the return of the Congolese refugees </p><p>should coincide with the second phase of implementation of </p><p>the Lusaka agreement. He said that in general the UN system </p><p>provides the same assistance to repatriated Congolese that it </p><p>provides to other internally displaced persons.  The </p><p>exception is UNHCR, which has been forbidden by its regional </p><p>office in Addis from providing Congolees returnees the </p><p>plastic sheeting it offers other IDPs.  He believes that TPD </p><p>is benevolent in its desire to help those who want to come </p><p>home now, and does not think the NGO receives any financial </p><p>benefit based on number of returnees.  O\'Dwyer criticized the </p><p>site chosen to receive these refugees because it is on the </p><p>border of Virunga park, which makes it vulnerable to </p><p>Interhamwe raids. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
