<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PRM MLANGE </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, EAID, PGOV, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SEX SCANDAL IN ZIMBABWE REFUGEE CAMP </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The July 1 edition of the independent "Daily News" </p><p>revealed that two aid workers in the Tongogara Refugee Camp </p><p>in southern Zimbabwe had been suspended after refugees lobbed </p><p>charges of sexual abuse against them.  The International </p><p>Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC), which operates the </p><p>camp, suspended Ernest Maigurira, its Zimbabwe program </p><p>director, and Mavuvo Pambai, its community service officer, </p><p>on June 25 until an investigation is completed.  (Note: The </p><p>Tongogara camp, in a remote area of Chipinge district of </p><p>southern Manicaland province, intermittently houses between </p><p>500 and 1000 international refugees, most of whom are from </p><p>Angola, Burundi, the DRC, and Rwanda.  The UNHCR and the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe oversee the camp.  End Note.)  At </p><p>least four women and eight teenage girls accused Maigurira </p><p>and Pambai of requiring sexual favors from them in exchange </p><p>for scholarships in Western countries, money to attend local </p><p>schools, blankets, and sanitary supplies, according to the </p><p>article.  One accused them of keeping makeshift beds in their </p><p>offices for sex with female refugees.  J. Michael Graglia, an </p><p>intern from the John Hopkins School of Advanced International </p><p>Studies sent by ICMC to evaluate the Zimbabwe camp, wrote a </p><p>June report detailing the allegations of abuse.  Maigurira </p><p>reportedly tried to have the GOZ cancel Graglia\'s work permit </p><p>after he submitted the report to ICMC headquarters in Geneva. </p><p> Maigurira denied any malfeasance and said any investigation </p><p>would exonerate him. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ICMC sent its Director of Operations, Dale Buscher, </p><p>to Zimbabwe to conduct an investigation during the week of </p><p>July 1 and found that "the allegations appear to be </p><p>substantiated," according to additional press reporting. </p><p>Buscher reportedly interviewed 26 refugees at the camp, some </p><p>of whom said the abuse had been going on for at least a year. </p><p> ICMC said it was "shocked and disturbed" by what it had </p><p>uncovered, and that it was cooperating with local police.  On </p><p>July 11, poloff spoke to John Adu, UNHCR\'s resident </p><p>representative in Zimbabwe, about the scandal.  Adu relayed </p><p>that UNHCR is conducting its own investigation and will have </p><p>a report out by the end of the month.  He added that the </p><p>suspended ICMC officers are not being allowed near the camp </p><p>while the investigations continue. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
