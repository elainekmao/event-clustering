<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (ADDED REF C) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, AORC, BM, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EU/BURMA: ITALIAN REACTION TO U.S. PROPOSALS;ICG </p><p>BRIEFING ATTENDANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 200487 B) STATE 200930 C) ROME 2585 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLOFF DISCUSSED REFTELS A AND B WITH MARCO DELLA </p><p>SETA, THE ITALIAN MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR COVERING BURMA.  HE WAS </p><p>INTERESTED IN UN SPECIAL ENVOY FOR BURMA RAZALI\'S BRIEFING TO </p><p>THE INFORMAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP (ICG) ON BURMA BUT IS UNABLE </p><p>TO ATTEND ON SHORT NOTICE.  HE INDICATED THE ITALIAN PERMREP </p><p>WOULD BE PRESENT AT THE ICG JULY 14 TO DEMONSTRATE THE GOI\'S </p><p>CONCERN.  HAVING MADE TWO BRUSSELS TRIPS DURING JULY 7-11 TO </p><p>DISCUSS BURMA, DELLA SETA MENTIONED THE COMMON POSITION HAD </p><p>NOT CHANGED AND THE EU WAS UNABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS ON </p><p>ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS, HAVING SEEN LITTLE RESPONSE FROM THE </p><p>CURRENT, RECENTLY STRENGTHENED SANCTIONS REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DISCUSSING THE VARIOUS POLICY OPTIONS SUGGESTED IN </p><p>REF A, SETA MADE CLEAR HE DID NOT THINK ANY OF THEM, WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF AN IMPORT BAN, WOULD EITHER BE LEGAL UNDER </p><p>ITALIAN LAW OR WOULD ACHIEVE AN EU, OR GOI, CONSENSUS.  THE </p><p>GOI WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER A STRONG TRAVEL WARNING, BUT </p><p>ACCORDING TO DELLA SETA IS PROHIBITED FROM RESTRICTING THE </p><p>TRAVEL OF ITS CITIZENS EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.  IN GENERAL, </p><p>ITALY REMAINS RELUCTANT TO USE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS UNLESS THEY </p><p>CAN BE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO AVOID THE GENERAL POPULATION. </p><p>REF C ADDRESSES PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON INTERNAL EU DYNAMICS </p><p>RELATED TO BURMA SANCTIONS.  AS THE EU ONLY RECENTLY </p><p>STRENGTHENED THEIR SANCTIONS, DELLA SETA BELIEVES ADDITIONAL </p><p>MEASURES UNLIKELY WITHOUT A PRECIPITATING EVENT.  THE </p><p>CONTINUED DETENTION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI IS APPARENTLY NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT NEW SANCTIONS, AND THE FAILURE OF THE </p><p>REGIME TO REACT TO THE EU\'S MEASURES DISCOURAGES NEW, AND </p><p>FROM AN ITALIAN PERSPECTIVE, LARGELY SYMBOLIC, MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DELLA SETA AGREED AN IMPORT BAN MIGHT BE POSSIBLE </p><p>UNDER EU AND ITALIAN LAW, ALTHOUGH AS HE REPEATEDLY STRESSED </p><p>HE IS NEITHER A LEGAL NOR A UN EXPERT.  HE WAS EAGER TO </p><p>DISCUSS RAZALI, A "LAME DUCK" WHOM HE FEELS WILL NONETHELESS </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENJOY ASIAN SUPPORT DUE TO "SOLIDARITY."  DELLA </p><p>SETA MENTIONED HE HAD HEARD RUMORS THAT RAZALI WAS INVOLVED </p><p>IN BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THE BURMESE REGIME AND WAS PERHAPS </p><p>NO LONGER AN HONEST BROKER.  DELLA SETA ALSO WAS DOUBTFUL </p><p>CHINA COULD BE INDUCED TO SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE ITS POLICIES </p><p>TOWARDS BURMA, AS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN ITS STRATEGIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  WHILE HE WELCOMES ADDITIONAL UN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT, HE WAS ALSO UNCLEAR HOW BURMA\'S DETENTION OF AUN </p><p>SAN SUU KYI COULD BECOME AN ISSUE FOR THE UNSC, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>BELIEVES THE GOI AND THE EU WOULD SUPPORT INCREASING </p><p>MULTILATERAL PRESSURE IF POSSIBLE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>2003ROME03215 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
