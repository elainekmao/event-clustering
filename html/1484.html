POST HAD SUGGESTED THAT A DOL TEAM MIGHT COME THE WEEK OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 12 (REF B); HOWEVER, OUR TWO KEY MOLISA </p><p>COUNTERPARTS ON THIS PROGRAM, MR. CUONG AND VICE MINISTER </p><p>NGUYEN LUONG TRAO HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THEY MUST ATTEND AN </p><p>ASEAN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE MEETING THAT WEEK.

SINCE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING WEEK IS A SHORT WEEK DUE TO THE PRESIDENT\'S DAY </p><p>HOLIDAY AND POST WILL BE HOSTING A LARGE CODEL, WE SETTLED </p><p>ON THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 26 AS THE NEXT POSSIBLE WINDOW.

CUONG HAS INSTRUCTED EACH OF THESE DEPARTMENTS TO </p><p>INDICATE THEIR PRIORITIES AND SPECIFIC PROJECT SUGGESTIONS. </p><p>HE EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THESE AFTER THE TET HOLIDAY DURING THE </p><p>WEEK OF JANUARY 29.  HE WILL THEN PRODUCE A UNIFIED RESPONSE </p><p>WHICH HE WILL PASS TO POST AND USDOL, ONCE CLEARED BY HIS </p><p>SUPERIORS.  WHILE THE GVN HOPES TO GET PROJECTS UNDERWAY IN </p><p>ALL SIX AREAS IDENTIFIED IN ANNEX 1, HE ANTICIPATES THAT </p><p>MOLISA WILL PLACE PRIORITY ON PROJECTS ON SOCIAL INSURANCE </p><p>AND SAFETY NETS, SKILLS TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND </p><p>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR LAW (IN THAT ORDER). </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL ASSISTANCE PROJECTS UNDER MOU </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CUONG ALSO PROVIDED HIS VIEWS ON WHAT FOCUS HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS LIKELY TO SUGGEST FOR PROJECTS IN THE AREAS </p><p>FOR BILATERAL COOPERATION.  WITHIN SKILLS TRAINING AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT SERVICES, MOLISA WOULD WANT A PROJECT AIMED AT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00145  01 OF 02  191043Z </p><p>IMPROVING THE DELIVERY OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES.  MS.  GREVE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ILO HAD COMPLETED A PROJECT WHICH HAD </p><p>ESTABLISHED PILOT CENTERS RUN BOTH THE VIETNAMESE GENERAL </p><p>CONFEDERATION OF LABOR (VGCL) AND MOLISA AND HAD RECENTLY </p><p>PRODUCED REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK WHICH SHE WOULD </p><p>SHARE WITH US. (POST WILL POUCH, FAX OR EMAIL, AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE, TO USDOL ALL MATERIALS GATHERED THAT MIGHT BE </p><p>OF USE IN PREPARING FOR THE TRIP.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, MOLISA IS LIKELY TO </p><p>SEEK ASSISTANCE TO STRENGTHEN ADMINISTRATION AND EXPAND </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE EXISTING SOCIAL INSURANCE SCHEME AND TO </p><p>DEVELOP UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH THE GVN DOES NOT </p><p>CURRENTLY PROVIDE.  AFTER LABOR OFF NOTED THAT USDOL DID NOT </p><p>RUN THE U.S. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM BUT DID HAVE </p><p>JURISDICTION OVER VARIOUS ISSUES HAVING TO DO WITH PENSIONS, </p><p>CUONG NOTED THAT ONE TOPIC OF INTEREST WAS HOW TO PROMOTE </p><p>AND DEVELOP "VOLUNTARY SOCIAL INSURANCE SCHEMES" (READ </p><p>PENSIONS) AND PERSONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS.  THE ILO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THAT THE ILO WOULD SOON RELEASE THE </p><p>RESULTS OF ITS RECENTLY COMPLETED PROJECT ON SOCIAL </p><p>INSURANCE AND SAID THAT A MEETING WAS SCHEDULED IN MID- </p><p>FEBRUARY TO DISCUSS THESE RESULTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>THE NEW LAW ON SOCIAL INSURANCE, THE FIRST DRAFT OF WHICH IS </p><p>DUE OCTOBER THIS YEAR.

WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTS IN THE AREA OF EMPLOYMENT OF </p><p>THE DISABLED, MOLISA WILL PROBABLY WANT TO FOCUS ON </p><p>IMPROVING IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING </p><p>POLICIES AND ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THE POLICIES THEMSELVES. </p><p>MS. GREVE NOTED THAT THE ILO WAS DEVELOPING A PROJECT ON </p><p>MAINSTREAMING THE DISABLED INTO THE WORKPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE ILO </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  MS. GREVE INFORMED US THAT SHE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GO </p><p>FORWARD ON PROGRAMS ON HIV/AIDS WORKPLACE-BASED PROGRAMS AND </p><p>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR LAW WHICH COULD BE SUBMITTED </p><p>FOR FUNDING IN PART OR IN WHOLE UNDER THE MOU.  IN THE CASE </p><p>OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS/LABOR LAW, ILO HEADQUARTERS HAS SET </p><p>A DEADLINE OF MARCH FOR COMPLETION OF A PROJECT DESIGN. </p><p>WHILE WORK HAS NOT YET STARTED IN EARNEST, THE ILO WILL </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON CAPACITY BUILDING IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, </p><p>ENTERPRISE LEVEL EMPLOYEE/EMPLOYER RELATIONS IN FOREIGN </p><p>ENTERPRISES, AND EMPLOYER ASSOCIATIONS AT THE LOCAL AND </p><p>PROVINCIAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WITH RESPECT TO A WORKPLACE-BASED HIV/AIDS PROJECT, A </p><p>PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY BEING FORMULATED WHICH ENVISIONS FOUR </p><p>DISTINCT ACTIVITIES: DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>EMPLOYER BEST PRACTICES DRAWN FROM PROGRAMS ALREADY IN PLACE </p><p>IN VARIOUS FOREIGN AND STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES; EDUCATING </p><p>LABOR INSPECTORS TO ENCOURAGE NON-DISCRIMINATION; </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00145  02 OF 02  191043Z </p><p>DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AT EMPLOYMENT CENTERS AIMED AT </p><p>YOUTH; AND PROVIDING INFORMATION VIA RURAL HOUSEHOLD </p><p>ENTERPRISE MICRO-CREDIT PROGRAMS AIMED AT GETTING THE AIDS </p><p>PREVENTION MESSAGES TO RURAL POPULATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN AT </p><p>RISK AFTER THEY MIGRATE TO THE CITIES. </p><p> </p><p>11. ANY CHILD LABOR PROGRAM UNDER THE MOU WOULD BE DONE </p><p>UNDER AN ILO PROJECT ALREADY UNDERWAY, ACCORDING TO MS. </p><p>GREVE.  NOW THAT SOME PRELIMINARY WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED, </p><p>THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROJECT WOULD BE DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT </p><p>WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR AN MOU BETWEEN THE ILO AND THE GVN </p><p>WHICH BOTH PARTIES HOPE TO SIGN LATER THIS YEAR.  WHILE </p><p>THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THIS STAGE OF THE </p><p>PROJECT FROM THE GENERAL FUND, MS. GREVE ANTICIPATED THAT </p><p>THE ILO WOULD BE SEEKING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  FEBRUARY AND MARCH ARE SHAPING UP TO BE BUSY MONTHS FOR </p><p>BOTH THE GVN AND THE EMBASSY.  THE GVN IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH POLITICAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE 9TH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS WHICH NOW LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE HELD IN APRIL.  FOR </p><p>ITS PART, THE EMBASSY\'S CALENDAR IS ALSO FILLING UP. </p><p>NONETHELESS, MOLISA AND THE EMBASSY WANT TO PROCEED WITH </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOU AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.  IN ORDER </p><p>TO FACILITATE PREPARATIONS DURING THIS BUSY PERIOD, WE ASK </p><p>THAT USDOL ADVISE SOONEST OF PROPOSED DATES FOR A PROJECT </p><p>DESIGN MISSION AS WELL AS SUBSTANTIVE AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT </p><p>POST CAN PROVIDE.  WE WISH TO COORDINATE VERY CLOSELY WITH </p><p>USDOL TO ASSURE WE ACHIEVE MAXIMUM PROGRESS DURING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00145  02 OF 02  191043Z </p><p>VISIT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
