<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000723 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALAN VIEWS ON IRAQ SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 708 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary. President Portillo told reporters on March 18 </p><p>that Guatemala "stands beside the United States," but said </p><p>Guatemala does not take a position for or against war with </p><p>Iraq.  He added that he sent a letter of support to President </p><p>Bush (reftel).  According to the MFA, the GOG delegation to </p><p>the Roatan Centam Presidential Summit reportedly had </p><p>instructions to sign a joint statement on Iraq, but it failed </p><p>to achieve consensus.  Some opposition party leaders have </p><p>expressed strong support for the U.S. while others have </p><p>expressed concern over economic fallout due to rising energy </p><p>prices.  Guatemalan public opinion is divided on Iraq.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Speaking in his home town of Zacapa, President Alfonso </p><p>Portillo told reporters that Guatemala has not taken a </p><p>position on hostilities with Iraq.  However, he stressed that </p><p>in this delicate time Guatemala "will stand with its ally, </p><p>the United States."  Portillo dodged questions about possible </p><p>economic repercussions for Guatemala of any military action </p><p>in Iraq.  He said that although the international situation </p><p>is "grave," Guatemala understands the responsibility of the </p><p>U.S. to respond to it.  Portillo described his recent letter </p><p>to President Bush (reftel) as a further example of his </p><p>support and told the crowd the letter was intended to </p><p>"encourage U.S. authorities because they are living through </p><p>difficult moments."  Political cartoons lampooned Portillo\'s </p><p>indecision on the potential hostilities, depicting him as a </p><p>chicken buffeted by the winds of war but insisting that "we </p><p>are not for or against, in fact just the opposite..." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Deputy Foreign Minister Abiu told us on March 19 </p><p>that Guatemala had instructed its representatives at the </p><p>Centam presidential summit in Roatan, Honduras, to sign a </p><p>Central American Summit statement on Iraq.  He said that </p><p>there had been no consensus on the statement, however, and </p><p>said ultimately the statement was withdrawn. He said that </p><p>President Portillo\'s statement was intended to make clear </p><p>that, without taking a position for or against hostilities, </p><p>the GOG will stand by the United States. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Opposition party leaders have publicly and privately </p><p>expressed a wide range of reactions to events in the Persian </p><p>Gulf.  Some have strongly endorsed U.S. military action, </p><p>while others have limited themselves to expressing concern </p><p>over the potential of economic consequences to Guatemala of </p><p>any war. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Public opinion appears divided.  There have been a </p><p>number of small, peaceful demonstrations outside the Embassy </p><p>in recent weeks against the possibility of war in Iraq.  The </p><p>demonstrators tend to be student or religious groups and have </p><p>not attracted large numbers of protesters.  Despite fairly </p><p>regular press coverage implying that Guatemala will suffer </p><p>from higher energy prices and reduced tourism, most average </p><p>Guatemalans are more concerned with daily problems than with </p><p>events in the Middle East.  The media has also devoted </p><p>detailed coverage to the 860 active duty and 650 reservists </p><p>of Guatemalan origin who are currently serving with the U.S. </p><p>military, reporting in some cases anxiety about the </p><p>possibility of war and in others, patriotic pride in serving </p><p>their adopted country. </p><p> </p><p>6 (SBU) Comment: We see Portillo\'s statement as trying to </p><p>have it both ways. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
