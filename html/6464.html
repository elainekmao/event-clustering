<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, MOPS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEE AND TRANSIT CAMPS IN JORDAN NEARLY READY </p><p>FOR OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is a joint Embassy/DART message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) UNHCR REFUGEE CAMP:  As of mid-day (local time) on </p><p>March 18, GOJ workers were laying water/sanitation </p><p>infrastructure -- water tanks, latrine pits, a trench system </p><p>and cesspools.  UNHCR has not yet received authorization from </p><p>the GOJ to erect rubhalls and tents.  Once authorization is </p><p>given, UNHCR will set up tents for 5,000 refugees (1,000 </p><p>tents) and will have the ability to expand the camp site in </p><p>modular increments of 5,000 persons, up to a total of 20,000 </p><p>persons.  UNHCR has moved non-food items for 10,000 refugees </p><p>to warehouse near Ruweished and has deployed a team of five </p><p>staff to Ruweished (identified on USG maps as Ruwayshid or </p><p>H-4), including its senior logistics officer, national </p><p>protection officer and security officer.  It will share </p><p>office space with the Hashemite Charitable Organization, </p><p>designated by the GOJ to serve as host-country coordinator </p><p>for refugee issues.  UNHCR has identified the following NGO </p><p>implementing partners:  OXFAM for water; Middle East Council </p><p>of Churches for sanitation; and Japan Platform for medical </p><p>care.  WFP will provide food. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IOM/JRCS TRANSIT CAMP FOR TCNS:  As of March 13, key </p><p>infrastructure for the transit camp -- one 17,000 liter water </p><p>tank, rows of latrine toilets, a trench system and cesspools </p><p>-- was in place.  Late on March 17, the GOJ gave the Jordan </p><p>Red Crescent Society (JRCS) authorization to erect a rubhall </p><p>and 1,000 tents; JRCS is doing so today, March 18.  The </p><p>International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent </p><p>Societies has provided non-food items for 5,000 TCNs. </p><p>Although the JRCS had identified the Jordanian Evangelical </p><p>Committee for Relief and Development as its implementing </p><p>partner for food services, neither has funds available to </p><p>actually purchase food.  According to IOM, the transit camp\'s </p><p>water needs will be supplied by the GOJ\'s Ministry of Water, </p><p>but IOM will have to pay for the water and its transportation </p><p>(see para 4).  GOJ officials, however, told emboffs March 13 </p><p>that water for the transit camp would be supplied from a well </p><p>approximately 3 km to the east of the transit camp.  IOM has </p><p>established an office in Ruweished that is fully connected to </p><p>IOM offices throughout the region, and will have five staff </p><p>in place there on the morning of March 19.  IOM will also </p><p>establish a two-person office in Aqaba on March 19, to </p><p>facilitate onward transportation of Egyptian and Sudanese </p><p>nations.  (Refcoord/DART funding recommendation:  Because the </p><p>needs and supposed funding arrangements identified by the GOJ </p><p>and JRCS keep shifting, we recommend that all funds for camp </p><p>management services -- including food and water -- continue </p><p>to be directed toward IOM.  As the overall lead agency for </p><p>TCN issues, IOM is better positioned to identify and respond </p><p>to emerging needs, and our funding would therefore have the </p><p>greatest flexibility if implemented through IOM.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) WATER:  UNHCR and IOM report that water for both </p><p>camps will be supplied by the GOJ\'s Ministry of Water, from </p><p>the well dug near Ruweished and treated by the US-funded </p><p>reverse osmosis purification unit.  IOM will be required to </p><p>purchase the water at a cost of USD 6.5 per cubic meter.  IOM </p><p>will also need to pay separately for transport of water from </p><p>the well (located near the refugee camp) to the transit camp, </p><p>a distance of approximately seven km.  JRCS will distribute </p><p>water within the TCN transit camp.  UNHCR is still </p><p>negotiating its water arrangements with the GOJ but has made </p><p>arrangements with OXFAM to distribute water within the </p><p>refugee camp. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACCESS TO EASTERN JORDAN:  The biggest remaining </p><p>obstacle is access to all points east of Safawiye for UNHCR </p><p>and IOM\'s NGO implementing partners.  The GOJ most likely </p><p>will close this entire area at the onset of hostilities in </p><p>Iraq.  The GOJ has informed IOM that permission has been </p><p>granted for its staff and vehicles to travel to Ruweished but </p><p>that documentation will be issued at a later date, presumably </p><p>the onset of hostilities.  UNHCR\'s documentation will be </p><p>arranged through the Hashemite Charitable Organization.  Yet </p><p>none of IOM or UNHCR\'s NGO implementing partners yet have the </p><p>appropriate authorization to travel to eastern Jordan -- a </p><p>bureaucratic obstacle that could potentially slow down relief </p><p>efforts.  We will continue to work with the GOJ to ensure </p><p>that an appropriate system is established to grant permits to </p><p>NGOs to access eastern Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) We also note that JAF officials have repeatedly </p><p>stated that authorization for IOs and NGOs to move in the </p><p>closed military area will be point-to-point only, e.g., for </p><p>organizations to travel to a specific camp or to the border. </p><p>Relief organizations will not be allowed to deviate from </p><p>their plans and travel to a different destination once they </p><p>have been granted access to the military area.  Because two </p><p>different sets of relief agencies will be working in the two </p><p>different camps, we do not anticipate any problems in this </p><p>"point-to-point" access system. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
