KEYSER. REASON: 1.5(B,C,D)X1, X5 </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) BACKGROUND: DURING MISSILE NONPROLIFERATION TALKS ON </p><p>MARCH 6 IN WASHINGTON, CHINA\'S MFA ARMS CONTROL AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT DIRECTOR GENERAL LIU JIEYI TOLD NP A/S WOLF THAT </p><p>CHINA WAS TAKING SEVERAL, SIGNIFICANT NEW STEPS TO TIGHTEN </p><p>CHINA\'S NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL EXPORT REGULATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING HAVING INTERIM CONTROLS COVERING ALL ITEMS ON THE </p><p>AUSTRALIA GROUP (AG) CONTROL LIST IN PLACE BY THE END OF </p><p>MARCH. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) THIS IS WELCOME ACTION THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. WE </p><p>ALSO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF </p><p>THESE CONTROLS, AND RAISE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN ENTITIES </p><p>SEEKING DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINA. IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, INFORMATION EXISTS THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE </p><p>APPROACHED TWO CHINESE FIRMS -- ZIBO CHEMET EQUIPMENT PLANT, </p><p>ALSO KNOWN AS ZIBO CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT PLANT (ZCEP), AND </p><p>LIAOYANG PHARMACEUTICAL MACHINERY IMPORT AND EXPORT (LPMIE) </p><p>-- FOR LARGE QUANTITIES OF DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT. WE </p><p>WANT CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT </p><p>THE TRANSFER. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACTION REQUEST: DEPARTMENT REQUESTS POST CONVEY THE </p><p>POINTS IN PARA 3 TO THE APPROPRIATE HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S - REL CHINA) BEGIN TALKING POINTS. </p><p>-- WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S PUBLICATION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF AN INTERIM MEASURE CONTROLLING ALL ITEMS </p><p>LISTED IN THE AUSTRALIA GROUP LISTS. THESE MEASURES WILL </p><p>HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT </p><p>POSE A THREAT TO THE CITIZENS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BY </p><p>STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM SUCH AS IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAN HAS ACKNOWLEDGED ITS PAST DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL </p><p>WEAPONS. IRAN ALSO HAS CONTINUED ITS EFFORTS TO SEEK </p><p>DUAL-USE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY, EXPERTISE, AND PRECURSOR </p><p>CHEMICALS FROM CHINESE ENTITIES. THIS ASSISTANCE COULD BE </p><p>USED TO CREATE A MORE ADVANCED AND SELF-SUFFICIENT CHEMICAL </p><p>WARFARE INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT IRAN IS SEEKING TO </p><p>PROCURE LARGE QUANTITIES OF AUSTRALIA GROUP-CONTROLLED, </p><p>DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINESE COMPANIES. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, IRANIAN FIRMS HAVE APPROACHED THE CHINESE FIRM </p><p>ZIBO CHEMET EQUIPMENT PLANT -- ALSO KNOWN AS ZIBO CHEMICAL </p><p>EQUIPMENT PLANT (ZCEP) -- AND LIAOYANG PHARMACEUTICAL </p><p>MACHINERY IMPORT AND EXPORT (LPMIE). WE BELIEVE THAT IRAN </p><p>HAS ACTED THROUGH LPMIE\'S SALES REPRESENTATIVE IN IRAN, ARYA </p><p>FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FACT THAT IRAN IS SEEKING SUCH A LARGE QUANTITY OF </p><p>GLASS-LINED CHEMICAL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RAISES SERIOUS </p><p>CONCERNS THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES, </p><p>BUT IN FACT WILL BE DIVERTED TO IRAN\'S OFFENSIVE CHEMICAL </p><p>WEAPONS PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE URGE CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND TAKE ALL </p><p>NECESSARY STEPS TO STOP THIS TRANSACTION FROM OCCURRING AND </p><p>PREVENT CHINESE ENTITIES FROM CONTRIBUTING EVEN INADVERTENTLY </p><p>TO IRAN\'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM. AS A STATE PARTY TO THE </p><p>CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION, CHINA HAS AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL </p><p>OBLIGATION NOT TO ASSIST ANYONE, IN ANY WAY, IN CHEMICAL </p><p>WEAPONS ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE RESULTS OF YOUR </p><p>INVESTIGATION. </p><p>END POINTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PLEASE SLUG REPLIES FOR NP/CBM, EAP/CM, AND INR/SPM. </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
