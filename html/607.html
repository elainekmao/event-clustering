<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JEDDAH 01305 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/B </p><p>LONDON FOR JOHNSON </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL OADR </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: THE KINGDOM\'S LEADING "RELIGIOUS REFORMERS" </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 92 JEDDAH 192, (B) 92 JEDDAH 279, (C) 92 JEDDAH </p><p>607, (D) 92 RIYADH 4210 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE AWAKENING, OR "AS-SAHWAH" AS IT IS KNOWN IN </p><p>ARABIC, IS THE GENERAL TERM USED TO DESCRIBE THE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS TREND WHICH GAINED STRENGTH IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA FOLLOWING OPERATION DESERT STORM.  IT HAS </p><p>REMAINED A LOOSELY STRUCTURED MOVEMENT WITHOUT FORMAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION OR A LEADERSHIP HIERARCHY.  POL/ECON OFFICER </p><p>RECENTLY ASKED TWO YOUNG SHARI\'A COURT LAWYERS FOR THEIR </p><p>LIST OF THE AWAKENING\'S MOST IMPORTANT LEADERS.  WHILE </p><p>TRAINED AT MAKKAH\'S UM AL-QURA ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, THESE </p><p>TWO CONTACTS WOULD NOT DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS RELIGIOUS </p><p>ACTIVISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  OUR CONTACTS CHARACTERIZED THOSE THEY NAMED AS THE </p><p>MOST INFLUENTIAL "RADICAL SALAFIYEEN".  "SALAFIYEEN" IS A </p><p>TERM WHICH DESCRIBES THOSE WHO WISH TO RETURN TO THE WAYS </p><p>OF THEIR ANCESTORS.  AS USED BY OUR CONTACTS, IT HAS </p><p>NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SALAFIYYAH MOVEMENT FOUNDED BY </p><p>JAMAL AL-DIN AL-AFGHANI AND MOHAMMAD ABDUH IN EGYPT AT </p><p>THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.  WE HAVE TRANSLATED IT AS </p><p>"REFORMERS" SINCE THE ARABIC LACKS THE NEGATIVE </p><p>CONNOTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH REACTIONARIES.  THESE </p><p>REFORMERS ARE REPORTEDLY MOSTLY YOUNG, INTERESTED IN </p><p>CURRENT EVENTS AND MORE STRICT IN THEIR RELIGIOUS </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS THAN TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS SUCH </p><p>AS ABDULAZIZ BIN BAZ.  THOSE WHO PREACH ARE REPORTEDLY </p><p>WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR "FIERY SERMONS". </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LIST OUR CONTACTS PROVIDED IS INTERESTING FOR </p><p>SEVERAL REASONS.  FIRST, THEY PROVIDED 16 NAMES, WITH BIO </p><p>DATA FOR EACH, DIRECTLY FROM THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. </p><p>THUS, WHILE THESE RELIGIOUS ACTIVISTS MAY NOT BE </p><p>HOUSEHOLD NAMES, THEY FORM A WELL KNOWN AND RECOGNIZABLE </p><p>GROUP IN THE MINDS OF THESE TWO LAWYERS.  MOST ARE ON THE </p><p>FACULTIES OF THE KINGDOM\'S RELIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN RIYADH.  NONE ARE FROM THE EASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE.  MOST OF THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECENT </p><p>"COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS", </p><p>INCLUDING ITS SIX FOUNDERS, WERE NOT MENTIONED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MANY, BUT NOT ALL, OF THOSE NAMED SIGNED LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE (MOA) TO THE KING.  THE MEMORANDUM </p><p>OF ADVICE OUTLINED PROPOSALS FOR A MORE ISLAMICLY CORRECT </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND IS THE CLOSEST THING THE AWAKENING HAS </p><p>PRODUCED TO A MANIFESTO.  NOT SIGNING IT, HOWEVER, DOES </p><p>NOT APPEAR TO EXCLUDE ONE FROM BEING CONSIDERED AN </p><p>IMPORTANT RELIGIOUS REFORMER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FINALLY AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS LENGTHY </p><p>LIST AND OUR CONTACTS\' RELATED COMMENTS INDICATE THAT THE </p><p>AWAKENING HAS NOT YET PRODUCED A SINGLE, RECOGNIZED </p><p>NATIONAL LEADER.  THERE IS NO SAUDI KHOMEINI. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE LIST OF RELIGIOUS REFORMERS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>SAFFAR BIN ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-HAWALI: FACULTY MEMBER AT UM </p><p>AL-QURA UNIVERSITY IN MAKKAH, SIGNED THE MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>ADVICE (MOA). </p><p> </p><p>NASSIR BIN SALMAN AL-AMR: FACULTY MEMBER AT IMMAM </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY IN RIYADH. </p><p> </p><p>SALMAN BIN FAHD AL-AWDAH: FACULTY MEMBER AT IMMAM </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY, QASSIM BRANCH, SIGNED THE </p><p>MOA. </p><p> </p><p>DR.
