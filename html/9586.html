<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001248 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TRIBUNALS UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ABUJA 1049 </p><p>     B. B) ABUJA 934 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASON: 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Begin Summary: State election tribunals have been </p><p>rendering decisions for one month.  Three elections have been </p><p>overturned, but the majority of the petitions have been </p><p>thrown out on procedural grounds.  The proclivity of the </p><p>tribunals to avoid the substantive merits of many of these </p><p>cases has hurt the image of the judiciary.  Opposition </p><p>politicians are also pointing to this phenomenon as evidence </p><p>that the tribunals are being unduly affected by the </p><p>government and ruling party.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>The Tribunals make some decisions </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Election tribunals, mandated in the 36 states to hear </p><p>grievances arising from the National Assembly and </p><p>gubernatorial elections in April, began proceedings the week </p><p>prior to the Presidential Inauguration on May 29.  Decisions </p><p>have been coming in since early June.  To date, decisions </p><p>have been publicized in more than 40 cases in 24 states and </p><p>the Federal Capital Territory.  (NOTE: After the state </p><p>tribunal issues a verdict, the aggrieved parties can appeal </p><p>to the Federal Court of Appeals and later to the Supreme </p><p>Court. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) As reported in reftel B, petitions were filed in over </p><p>20 gubernatorial and 60 National Assembly elections.  Three </p><p>election results have been overturned, 41 cases have been </p><p>dismissed, and petitions have been withdrawn in at least </p><p>seven cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Exercising their authority </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Despite the widespread reports of electoral </p><p>irregularities, particularly in the South-South and </p><p>Southeast, only three elections have been overturned by the </p><p>tribunals.  The Edo State tribunal overturned a House of </p><p>Representatives election in favor of the ANPP candidate </p><p>(reftel A).  In Borno State, the tribunal overturned the </p><p>Northern Senatorial district election in favor of another </p><p>ANPP candidate.  The Borno tribunal accepted evidence that </p><p>elections were not held at four polling units, and that the </p><p>PDP candidate, Mohammed Sanusi Daggash, disrupted the </p><p>election process by removing ballot boxes and instigating the </p><p>arrest of several INEC officials.  In Abuja, a House of </p><p>Representatives election was overturned in favor of the ANPP </p><p>after an INEC official admitted to a miscount that provided </p><p>the PDP candidate a slim victory.  The PDP candidate, Alhaji </p><p>Baba Takwa, died last month of cirrhosis of the liver. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In the other Abuja House election, the tribunal </p><p>ordered INEC to conduct a new election in two polling units </p><p>where elections had not taken place in April.  INEC was given </p><p>two weeks from June 25 to provide results for these areas. </p><p>This new election has not yet taken place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Thrown out on procedural grounds </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) For the majority of tribunal decisions, substantive </p><p>evidence was not heard because the cases were dismissed due </p><p>to alleged procedural flaws in the petitions.  A number of </p><p>reasons have been given for dismissing petitions.  In Abia </p><p>State, petitions contesting the gubernatorial election were </p><p>discarded for not mentioning the various candidates for </p><p>deputy governor.  In Adamawa and Imo States, petitions were </p><p>dismissed for not listing INEC as a defendant.  Conversely, </p><p>the Delta State tribunal dismissed a gubernatorial petition </p><p>for listing INEC as a defendant.  Nine cases in seven states </p><p>were thrown out because the petitioner either failed to sign </p><p>the petition or failed to list all the candidates for that </p><p>particular election and their respective results in the </p><p>election.  In Akwa Ibom, a petition was rejected because the </p><p>Tribunal Secretary did not sign a receipt of the petition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Other reasons for rejecting petitions have been </p><p>failing to appear before the tribunal and failure to respond </p><p>to a counter-affidavit on time.  Even though the established </p><p>rules of the tribunal state that either a candidate or his </p><p>party may petition the court, a petition regarding the </p><p>gubernatorial election in Ekiti State was thrown out because </p><p>the party apparently did not have the candidate,s consent to </p><p>contest the election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In Imo State, four different opposition parties filed </p><p>petitions regarding the gubernatorial election.  All were </p><p>rejected: one for not being timely filed, one for not listing </p><p>INEC as a defendant, one for not listing the other candidates </p><p>and their results, and one for being incompetent and </p><p>defective (NOTE: This latter reason is the formal reason </p><p>listed for most rejections, whether based on substantive or </p><p>procedural grounds. END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) In cases where the tribunals have heard evidence, </p><p>greater weight seems to have been given the testimony of IENC </p><p>and government officials.  The testimony of opposition </p><p>figures has been afforded the same evidentiary stature.  The </p><p>Plateau State tribunal is a prime example.  The incumbent PDP </p><p>governor was declared the winner of the election and the </p><p>governor,s personal assistant gave his assurance in court </p><p>that INEC had been fair during the election, a statement </p><p>sufficient to counter the opposition,s witnesses.  In </p><p>multiple states the State Electoral Chairman,s testimony and </p><p>assurance that INEC acted properly have been enough to sway </p><p>the court.  In cases where INEC or the government has refused </p><p>to respond to a summons, the unresponsiveness has been </p><p>rewarded by the assumption that, if no documentation was </p><p>produced, there was nothing to hide.  The cases have been </p><p>thrown out for lack of evidence, regardless of documentation </p><p>provided by the petitioner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Possible subversion </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Critics have pointed to the manner in which the </p><p>tribunals are financed and supported as a means to exert </p><p>influence over the judges.  Each state tribunal is supposed </p><p>to be constituted by judges from out of state, thus the </p><p>receiving state must provide lodging and other support for </p><p>these jurists.  Opposition figures complain that governors </p><p>who pay to accommodate the judges thus are able to exert </p><p>influence over the judges, decisions.  (NOTE: In almost </p><p>every instance, judges have been housed in State Government </p><p>lodges.  It is fitting and inevitable that government would </p><p>pay tribunal expenses.  There is no other entity that would </p><p>foot the bills.  However, because of the strong personal </p><p>control governors have over state funds and official </p><p>premises, many people believe that in extending assistance to </p><p>the tribunals, the governors also gained access and perhaps a </p><p>degree of control over the judges. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Many Nigerians have questioned the independence and </p><p>integrity of the tribunals.  Immediately after the elections, </p><p>the general consensus was that aggrieved parties should </p><p>follow the constitutionally mandated electoral complaint </p><p>procedure.  Appropriately, domestic observers and the </p><p>international community called on the tribunals to be </p><p>impartial and follow the rule of law so that the judicial </p><p>process could resolve as many electoral irregularities as </p><p>possible.  Justice and fairness required no less.  However, a </p><p>high percentage of cases have been dismissed because of </p><p>procedural flaws.  These incidences of dismissal have served </p><p>to confirm the suspicions of opposition politicians that the </p><p>tribunals were not interested in doing justice or hearing the </p><p>merits of their complaints.  Now many of these cases will go </p><p>into the federal court system to determine if dismissals were </p><p>proper.  It would be a positive development for electoral </p><p>jurisprudence, and politics in general, if the federal court </p><p>system determined that at least some cases should be heard on </p><p>their merits.  However, by the time the federal courts hear </p><p>these cases, it will be August, most likely September, when a </p><p>full four months would have elapsed since the controversial </p><p>elections. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
