<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, August 7, focuses </p><p>on King Abdullah\'s meetings with the Iraq and Turkish </p><p>foreign ministers in Amman yesterday regarding </p><p>developments on the Iraq and Palestinian scenes. </p><p>Major commentaries today regard the developments on </p><p>the Iraqi scene, arguing that, while Iraq is extending </p><p>a hand for reconciliation, the United States is </p><p>illogically calling for war. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "America is isolating itself" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/07) editorializes:  "The United States continues </p><p>its blatant threats of a military blow against Iraq, </p><p>in a manner that seems to be out of swing from the </p><p>growing international consensus against such an </p><p>American action, that completely lacks international </p><p>legitimacy.  We realize that America\'s intentions of </p><p>dealing an aggressive blow to Iraq are very serious </p><p>indeed, but we also understand that the U.S. </p><p>administration\'s lack of international consensus and </p><p>Arab agreement for such a blow is going to disarm </p><p>Washington of one of the most important weapons, </p><p>namely the moral and legal basis for using </p><p>unjustifiable force against a small and besieged </p><p>country to oust its ruling regime." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraq and reconciliation" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/07):  "The U.S. nervous reaction to and rejection </p><p>of Iraq\'s invitation to the head of the inspectors to </p><p>visit Baghdad proves yet again that Washington is not </p><p>interested in the issue of the inspections or any </p><p>other issues used as pretexts for striking Iraq.  It </p><p>only wants to change the ruling regime and deal the </p><p>military blow in order to have control over Iraq\'s oil </p><p>resources.  The Iraqi invitation is very smart.  It </p><p>has uncovered the true nature of the U.S. stand and </p><p>has provided Iraq\'s friends and allies with a new </p><p>opportunity to maneuver and pull the rug from under </p><p>the feet of the Americans.  Iraq\'s moves deserve all </p><p>the support they can get from the Arab world.  What is </p><p>also required are Iraqi steps towards the Iraqi people </p><p>themselves in order to pull the rug from the feet of </p><p>the Americanized Iraqi opposition." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraq\'s desire to hold a dialogue" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/07):  "Through a number of initiatives, including </p><p>the most recent invitations to the chief inspector and </p><p>the U.S. congress to visit Iraq, the Iraqis are </p><p>confirming their desire to hold a dialogue and find a </p><p>way out of the crisis between Iraq and the United </p><p>States.  But, when it comes to Baghdad, Washington is </p><p>thinking in terms of force.  This is the root of the </p><p>problem that threatens the Middle East with another </p><p>disaster." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
