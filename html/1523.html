IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S ASSAULT </p><p>ON THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA HAS NOT ABATED IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>THE BOMBING OF THE "DAILY NEWS."  THE CURRENT ATTACK </p><p>ON PRESS FREEDOM IS, HOWEVER, MORE SOPHISTICATED AND </p><p>MAY IN THE LONG RUN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF THE "DAILY NEWS" PRINTING PRESSES.  THE </p><p>METHODOLOGY INCLUDES SELECTIVE ACCREDITATION OF </p><p>JOURNALISTS, EXORBITANT FEES FOR CREDENTIALING FOREIGN </p><p>PRESS, DENYING ACCESS AND INFORMATION TO THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA, AND LOOMING RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN </p><p>OWNERSHIP OR SUPPORT TO INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  THE GOZ IS </p><p>PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS TO MUZZLE THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>PRESS AND THE PUBLIC\'S ACCESS TO INFORMATION, A KEY </p><p>COMPONENT IN ITS STRATEGY FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN SPITE OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO\'S (UNCONVINCING AND TEPID) EXPRESSION OF </p><p>CONCERN AFTER THE JANUARY 28 BOMBING OF THE "DAILY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00741  01 OF 02  131359Z </p><p>NEWS" PRINTING PRESS, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>(GOZ) CAMPAIGN TO RESTRICT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND </p><p>ACCESS TO INFORMATION HAS INTENSIFIED.  A FEBRUARY 3 </p><p>NOTICE IN GOVERNMENT-OWNED NEWSPAPERS INSTRUCTED ALL </p><p>JOURNALISTS TO APPLY FOR NEW CREDENTIALS TO COVER </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  THE REGISTRATION PERIOD RUNS THROUGH </p><p>FEBRUARY 16, BUT THE APPARENT INTENT OF THIS MOVE IS </p><p>TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>COVERAGE TO "FRIENDLY" JOURNALISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION HAS ALSO SCRAPPED </p><p>CENTRALIZED ISSUANCE OF PRESS CREDENTIALS FOR COVERING </p><p>THE GOZ.  JOURNALISTS MUST NOW APPLY TO EACH MINISTRY </p><p>OR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE CREDENTIAL REQUIRED </p><p>FOR ACCESS.  INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS ARE ALREADY </p><p>FEELING THE EFFECTS OF GOZ FIATS BANNING THEM FROM </p><p>SOME OFFICES AND EVENTS.  ALL LEVELS OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>REPUBLIC POLICE, EVEN POLICE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICIALS, </p><p>NOW FLATLY REFUSE TO SPEAK TO JOURNALISTS FROM THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  INDEPENDENT MEDIA HAVE ALSO </p><p>RECENTLY BEEN BARRED FROM ATTENDING GOZ PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCES AND WERE BANNED FROM THE PUBLIC VIEWING OF </p><p>LAURENT KABILA\'S BODY, AN EVENT THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>MEDIA COVERED FULLY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN JUNE 2000 THE GOZ INITIATED A US$100 </p><p>ACCREDITATION FEE FOR FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WISHING TO </p><p>COVER ZIMBABWE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THAT FEE </p><p>REMAINS IN FORCE, SUPPLEMENTED BY A US$500 FEE FOR A </p><p>TEMPORARY IMPORT PERMIT REQUIRED TO BRING TELEVISION </p><p>EQUIPMENT INTO ZIMBABWE.  THESE FEES ARE AFFORDABLE BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00741  01 OF 02  131359Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIA STANDARDS, BUT HAVE HAD THE EFFECT </p><p>OF REDUCING COVERAGE OF EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE BY REGIONAL </p><p>NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, FREE-LANCE REPORTERS AND </p><p>STRINGERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DURING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 4 MINISTER MOYO </p><p>PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED HIS DETERMINATION TO LIMIT FOREIGN </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF MEDIA IN ZIMBABWE.  FURTHERMORE, HE SAID </p><p>THAT INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MEDIA SHOULD BE BANNED.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE DIRECT </p><p>THREATS TO THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA, AND SEEM TO REFER </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN TO </p><p>HELP THE "DAILY NEWS" RECOVER FROM THE BOMBING OF ITS </p><p>PRESSES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY "THE HERALD" </p><p>INITIALLY TRUMPETED THE FACT THAT ITS PRESSES WERE </p><p>PRODUCING THE "DAILY NEWS" 3 TIMES PER WEEK </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE "DAILY NEWS" BOMBING.  THEIR </p><p>HEADLINE WAS "HERALD RESCUES DAILY NEWS."  THAT </p><p>ARRANGEMENT, STRUCK BY THE PAPER\'S MANAGING DIRECTOR </p><p>STRICTLY AS A MONEYMAKING COMMERCIAL DEAL, WAS NIXED </p><p>TWO WEEKS LATER BY "POLITICAL BOSSES."  THE "DAILY </p><p>NEWS" IS NOW SCRAMBLING TO FIND ANOTHER COMMERCIAL </p><p>PRINTER TO COVER THE 3 DAYS PER WEEK WHEN THEIR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0503 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00741  02 OF 02  131359Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C50DF4  131439Z /38 </p><p>R 131400Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8221 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000741 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PD (COX, HOWARD, SANDERS) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00741  02 OF 02  131359Z </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

(C) COMMENT: THIS SYSTEMATIC ATTACK ON THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA FITS IN NEATLY WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS </p><p>GOZ EFFORT TO COW THE JUDICIARY AND THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>AND IS A KEY COMPONENT IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S STRATEGY TO </p><p>RESTRICT THE PUBLIC\'S ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE VIEWS IN </p><p>THE RUN-UP TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  TAKEN </p><p>BY ITSELF, THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA </p><p>IS AN INSIDIOUS THREAT TO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.  IN </p><p>COMBINATION WITH THE ATTACKS AGAINST THE JUDICIARY AND </p><p>THE OPPOSITION, IT IS A DANGEROUS ASSAULT ON </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL, CONSTITUTIONALLY-GUARANTEED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND WILL BOLSTER ZIMBABWE\'S INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN </p><p>TREND.
