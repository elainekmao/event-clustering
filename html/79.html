<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ALEXANDRIA 00535 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PINS, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  LETTER FROM ALEXANDRIA:  RAMADAN I </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THIS IS THE FIRST MESSAGE IN A TWO-PART </p><p>SERIES WHICH DISCUSSES THE JUST-COMPLETED MONTH OF RAMADAN, </p><p>AND THE ENSUING FEAST PERIOD, IN THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE MONTH PASSED WITH THE TRADITIONAL GAIETY, THIS </p><p>YEAR THE MUSLIM HOLY MONTH OF DAYTIME FASTING WAS CELE- </p><p>BRATED AGAINST A BACKDROP OF APPARENT RISING FUNDAMEN- </p><p>TALISM, CHALLENGES TO THE PUBLIC ORDER, AND THE CONTINUING </p><p>SAGA OF THE "TRIAL BY PRESS" OF ALEXANDRIA\'S GOVERNOR. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RAMADAN, WHICH LASTED FROM MAY 20 TO JUNE 17 IN EGYPT, </p><p>WAS CELEBRATED IN TRADITIONAL FASHION IN ALEXANDRIA.  BUT </p><p>THIS YEAR, UNLIKE LAST, IT WAS AGAINST A BACKDROP OF </p><p>GROWING FUNDAMENTALISM AND SECURITY CONCERNS; WORSENING </p><p>QUALITY OF LIFE, AND A DETERIORATING URBAN ENVIRONMENT; </p><p>AND MORE THAN A WHIFF OF POLITICAL SCANDAL, DUE TO THE </p><p>ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF GOVERNOR MA\'1"\'S STEWARDSHIP OF </p><p>THE CITY (FOR BACKGROUND ON LATTER, SEE ALEXANDRIA 435). </p><p>FOR ALL THE GAIETIZ OF THE SEASON, ONE SENSED THAT SOME OF </p><p>IT WAS PROBABLY FORCED:  MANY OF THE ALEXANDRIANS WE KNOW </p><p>ARE WORRIED, BOTH ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR CITY. </p><p>RAMADAN--WHEN THE ADVANCE GUARD ARRIVES OF THE 1.5 MILLION </p><p>CAIRENES WHO EVENTUALLY SPEND THE SUMMER IN ALEXANDRIA-- </p><p>TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD TIME TO REFLECT ON LIFE IN THIS </p><p>CITY, AND TO COLLECT COMMENTS FROM OUR CONTACTS ABOUT </p><p>ISSUES WHICH CONCERN THEM. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>4.  IFTARS:  "IFTAR" (OR, BREAKFAST), THE MEAL WHICH </p><p>BREAKS THE FAST AT SUNSET, IS A TIME OF RESPLENDENT </p><p>FEASTS IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE REPORTING OFFICER DID NOT </p><p>ATTEND ANY AT WHICH THERE WAS LESS THAN FIVE TIMES THE </p><p>AMOUNT OF FOOD NECESSARY FOR THE NUMBER OF GUESTS PRESENT. </p><p>SOME OF THE FOODS ARE TRADITIONAL--FOR EXAMPLE, EGYPTIANS </p><p>OF ALL CLASSES ACTUALLY BREAK THE FAST WITH "FUL" (RED </p><p>BEANS)--INCLUDING IMPORTED ITEMS, SUCH AS THE APRICOT </p><p>PASTE (FROM SYRIA)WHICH IS USED TO MAKE THE RAMADAN-ONLY </p><p>DRINK, AMAR-EL-DINE.  THE PASTRY "KUNAFA" IS MADE ON </p><p>TURNING GRILLS, PLACED OUTSIDE ON SIDEWALKS DURING RAMADAN, </p><p>AND IS OFFERED AT EVERY IFTAR.  WHILE THE MEATS MAY VARY, </p><p>SHRIMP IS NOT A TRADITIONAL RAMADAN FOOD AND PRICES IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, KNOWN THROUGHOUT EGYPT FOR THIS DELICACY, </p><p>ACTUALLY PLUMMET DURING THIS TIME.  (ONE HOTEL MANAGER </p><p>OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE STOCKS UP,AND FREEZES, SHRIMP FOR THE </p><p>ENTIRE SUMMER DURING RAMADAN.)  WHILE IFTARS IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>ARE MORE SOCIAL, THAN RELIGIOUS, OCCASIONS, THIS YEAR WE </p><p>ATTENDED OUR FIRST HOME IFTAR WHICH HAD A SHAYKH PRESENT </p><p>TO LEAD THE TWO EVENING PRAYERS ON PRAYER RUGS ESPECIALLY </p><p>LAID OUT ON THE LAWN OF THE HOST\'S VILLA FOR THE OCCASION. </p><p>COMMENT:  IT IS PROBABLY WORTH NOTING, IF ONLY IN PASSING, </p><p>THAT NOT ALL OF THE VEILED WOMEN PRESENT, EITHER THIS YEAR, </p><p>OR LAST YEAR AT SIMILAR FUNCTION, JOINED IN THE PRAYERS. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO EXTREMELY HEAVY RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING </p><p>DURING RAMADAN, EGYPTIAN TELEVISION ALSO RUNS SPECIAL </p><p>VIEWER PARTICIPATION GAME SHOWS AND SERIALS IN THE EVENINGS. </p><p>LARGE COLOR TELEVISIONS ARE EVEN BROUGHT OUT OF DOORS </p><p>FOR GARDEN IFTARS.  BOTH YEARS, THE SERIAL WON OUT OVER </p><p>THE LAST EVENING PRAYER FOR AT LEAST A FEW OF THE VEILED </p><p>FEMALES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IFTAR CONVERSATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-- (A) VEILS:  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC DATA, THERE </p><p>WAS VISIBLY A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VEILED </p><p>FEMALES IN ALEXANDRIA DURING THIS RAMADAN.  FEMALE, MUSLIM </p><p>STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CONGEN (NONE OF WHOM IS VEILED) HAVE </p><p>EVEN COME TO US TO EXPRESS CONCERN.  THIS ISSUE--PERHAPS </p><p>CODE TO DISCUSS DEEPER WORRIES ABOUT THE RISE OF FUNDA- </p><p>MENTALISM-- WAS DISCUSSED REPEATEDLY BY OUR CONTACTS </p><p>DURING RAMADAN.  (COMMENT:  "VEILS", AS USED BY OUR </p><p>CONTACTS, AND IN THIS MESSAGE, DESCRIBES THE CURRENT </p><p>EGYPTIAN FASHION OF COVERED HEAD, HAIR AND THROAT--BUT </p><p>WITH FACE STILL VISIBLE, UNLIKE IN THE GULF--ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY LONG SLEEVE BLOUSES AND FLOOR LENGTH SKIRTS.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE (MODERATE) CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>OF EGYPT ADDRESSED THE BLUE-RIBBON EASTERN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>ROTARY CLUB DURING ONE RAMADAN IFTAR.  THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>VEILS APPARENTLY CAME UP DURING THE DISCUSSION, AND HE </p><p>ASSERTED THAT THE KORAN DOES NOT CALL FOR VEILING.  HE </p><p>WAS HEATEDLY DENOUNCED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE DEGREE THAT </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS ROTARY (COMPRISED MOSTLY OF THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESS LEADERSHIP OF ALEXANDRIA) FELT </p><p>OBLIGED TO STAND UP AND DEMAND APOLOGIES FROM THEIR FELLOW </p><p>ROTARIANS.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESSMEN IN </p><p>EGYPT, MOHAMED RAGAB, IS A MEMBER OF THIS ROTARY.  HIS </p><p>WIFE ADOPTED THE VEIL DURING RAMADAN--AND THAT HAS PRO- </p><p>VOKED MUCH COMMENTARY AMONG THE CITY\'S ELITE (WHOSE WIVES </p><p>ARE GENERALLY UNVEILED).  COMMENT:  IN A COUNTRY WHERE </p><p>FELLAHIN WOMEN TRADITIONALLY COVER THEIR HAIR WITH A </p><p>SCARF,  AND WHERE URBAN WIDOWS, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE </p><p>POOR, OFTEN ADOPT HEAD COVERING, "VEILS" ARE NOT UNKNOWN. </p><p>WE ARE TOLD, HOWEVER, THAT THEY ARE NOT TRADITIONAL AMONG </p><p>EDUCATED, URBAN FEMALES.  SOME OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE </p><p>ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN THAT SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN ARE </p><p>ADOPTING VEILS.  THIS, IN FACT, IS WHERE THE SHARP RISE </p><p>IN HEAD COVERINGS HAS OCCURRED.  BASED ON OUR TRAVELS IN </p><p>THE DELTA, IT REMAINS AN URBAN PHENOMENON.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- (B)  GOVERNOR MA\'AZ\'S  PROBLEMS:  THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE (SEE ALEXANDRIA 435) FINISHED </p><p>ITS WORK IN ALEXANDRIA DURING RAMADAN.  THE REPORT IS </p><p>SLATED TO BE PUBLISHED IN EARLY JULY, BUT ALREADY THE </p><p>PRESS IS REPORTING THAT THE COMMITTEE IS "SPLIT"--NOT </p><p>ON HIS GUILT, BUT ON WHETHER TO REFER HIS CASE TO THE </p><p>REGULAR COURTS OR THE SOCIALIST PROSECUTOR.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>THE NDP MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY WHO STARTED THE </p><p>AFFAIR, GEBRIL MOHAMED, IS SEEN CARRYING SHEAVES OF </p><p>PAPERS AROUND TOWN (PRESS REPORTS NOTE THAT HE HAS AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL 39 CHARGES TO OFFER TO THE COMMITTEE) CLAIMING </p><p>THIS CASE WILL BE "THE EGYPTIAN WATERGATE."  EARLY DURING </p><p>THE INVESTIGATION, THE ACCUSER SAID THAT HIS LIFE WAS </p><p>IN DANGER (THE WINDSHIELD WAS MYSTERIOUSLY BROKEN ON HIS </p><p>CAR, FOLLOWING WHICH HE HAS TAKEN TO PARKING IT OVERNIGHT </p><p>ON THE GROUNDS OF THE NDP PARTY HEADQUARTERS)--CERTAINLY </p><p>AN EXAGGERATION, BUT CALCULATED TO GARNER EVEN MORE </p><p>PUBLICITY FOR HIS CAUSE.  THERE IS CONTINUED EXTENSIVE </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION IN THE "WAFD" AND MOST </p><p>OTHER NATIONAL PRINT MEDIA.  DURING RAMADAN, THE GOVERNOR </p><p>GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO THE NEWS MAGAZINE "OCTOBER" CONCERNING </p><p>HIS PERSONAL REAL ESTATE DEALS IN THE NEARBY BEACH RESORT </p><p>OF AGAMI:  HE LIED, AND THE "WAFD" SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED </p><p>PHOTOCOPIES OF THE SALE AND TAX RECORDS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK HAS NOT SPOKEN OUT PUBLICLY ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, GOVERNOR MA\'AZ WAS NOTABLY ABSENT FROM THE LIST </p><p>OF GOVERNORS WHO RECEIVED AWARDS FROM THE PRESIDENT AT </p><p>THE JUST-CONCLUDED CONFERENCE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>CAIRO.  WE HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT </p><p>CAME TO ALEXANDRIA MAY 13 TO INAUGURATE VARIOUS PROJECTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE USAID TELEPHONE PROJECT, HE TOLD THE </p><p>GOVERNOR ON ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT THAT "IF WHAT THEY </p><p>SAY ABOUT YOU IN THE PRESS IS TRUE, THE CASE WILL GO TO </p><p>THE COURTS."  COMMENT:  WE CONTINUE TO BE INTRIGUED BY </p><p>HOW THE PRESIDENT HANDLES THE CASES OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS PUBLICLY ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION.  IN BOTH THE </p><p>MOUSTAPHA EL SAID CASE, AND NOW APPARENTLY WITH GOVERNOR </p><p>MA\'AZ, HE PERMITS A "TRIAL BY PRESS" AND THEN LETS THE </p><p>COURTS TAKE OVER.  FOR LESSER LIGHTS (EG. THE RECENT </p><p>NUMEROUS  FIRINGS AND FORCED RETIREMENTS IN THE CUSTOMS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION (SEE FORTHCOMING SEPTEL), THE RECKONING </p><p>DAY ARRIVES MORE SWIFTLY.  WE WONDER IF THIS OTHERWISE </p><p>ADMIRABLE LOYALTY TO HIS SENIOR OFFICIALS--FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>NOT SUSPENDING THEM DURING THE PRESS ATTACKS--MIGHT </p><p>BE MISPLACED?  END COMMENT.  AS ALEXANDRIANS ARE WELL-KNOWN </p><p>FOR BEING (IF OUR READERS WILL PERMIT) ALEXANDRIA-CENTRIC, </p><p>THIS ISSUE, ABOVE ALL OTHERS, DOMINATED RAMADAN CONVER- </p><p>SATIONS HERE.  THE GOVERNOR HAS VERY FEW DEFENDERS AMONG </p><p>THE ALEXANDRIA ELITE, WHOSE PRIME INTEREST NOW, APPEARS </p><p>TO BE SPECULATING ON HOW THE GOVERNOR\'S RIGHT HAND MAN </p><p>(AND WIDELY VIEWED AS CORRUPT, UNLIKE THE GOVERNOR), </p><p>GOVERNORATE SECRETARY-GENERAL SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM, HAS </p><p>MANAGED TO KEEP HIS NAME OUT OF THIS INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- (C)  NOT DISCUSSED:  WE WERE STRUCK BY THE LACK OF </p><p>CONVERSATION ON THE FATE OF THE PERSONAL STATUS LAW, AS IT </p><p>HAS APPARENTLY GALVANIZED CAIRO (SEE CAIRO 16094, PLUS </p><p>NEWS REPORTS ON THE SAME SUBJECT).  IF THE SUBJECT WAS </p><p>DISCUSSED, WE HAD TO RAISE IT.  WE DID--ON TWO OCCASIONS </p><p>DURING RAMADAN.  ONE EGYPTIAN WOMAN (AND FORMER WIFE OF </p><p>A SYRIAN VICE FOREIGN MINISTER) SAID THAT SHE HAD VISITED </p><p>THE NDP ALEX HEADQUARTERS TO TRY TO GET "SOMETHING" </p><p>STARTED AMONG THE WOMEN IN ALEXANDRIA, TO FORCE THE GOE TO </p><p>DEVELOP LEGISLATION TO REPLACE THE "JIHAN SADAT LAW" </p><p>STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS MAY 4.  SHE REPORTED THAT HER </p><p>REMARKS WERE RECEIVED WITH HOSTILITY BY THE THREE FEMALE </p><p>PARTY WORKERS WITH WHOM SHE SPOKE, WHO ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>JIHAN SADAT LAW WAS "CONTRARY" TO ISLAM.  OUR FRIEND, WHO </p><p>RELATED THIS AT A TABLE WITH THREE WELL-EDUCATED FEMALE </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS PRESENT, SUMMARIZED HER VIEWS THUS: </p><p>"SYRIAN WOMEN WOULD NEVER PUT UP WITH THIS.  EGYPTIAN </p><p>WOMEN ARE UNSOPHISTICATED."  (THE OTHERS PRESENT LET THE </p><p>REMARK STAND.) </p><p> </p><p>-- ONE MEMBER OF THE SAME FAMILY DECIDED TO ASK FOR A </p><p>DIVORCE IN MAY, WHEREUPON HER HUSBAND PROMPTLY ASKED </p><p>HER TO LEAVE THE CAIRO APARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED </p><p>FOR THE YOUNG COUPLE BY THE GIRL\'S FAMILY.  THESE KINDS </p><p>OF STORIES PROMPTED NDP ALEX PARTY CHIEF, MOHAMED </p><p>ABDELLAH, IN A LATER CONVERSATION, TO TERM THE GOE\'S </p><p>CURRENT EFFORTS TO PASS A PERSONAL STATUS LAW (SEE CAIRO </p><p>16752) THE "FLAT ACT."  THAT, HE ASSERTED, IS THE REAL </p><p>ISSUE.  EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT SECOND </p><p>MARRIAGES OF THEIR HUSBANDS (RARE AMONG EDUCATED--AND </p><p>POLITICIZED--EGYPTIANS, IN ANY EVENT), THAN IN SUDDENLY </p><p>FINDING THEMSELVES HOMELESS IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE </p><p>HOUSING CRISIS IS ACUTE, AND GROWING WORSE.  COMMENT: EVEN </p><p>THE EXPECTED LARGE RETURN OF EGYPTIANS FROM THE GULF WILL </p><p>AGGRAVATE THE HOUSING PROBLEM IN ALEXANDRIA:  MANY WOMEN, </p><p>INCLUDING SOME ON THE CONSULATE STAFF, ARE RESIDING, </p><p>WITH THEIR CHILDREN, IN THEIR PARENTS\' HOME DURING THEIR </p><p>HUSBANDS\' LENGTHY ABSENCES IN THE GULF.  THESE PROFESSIONAL </p><p>COUPLES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID FACING THE HOUSING CRUNCH-- </p><p>THUS FAR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FASTING:  WE KNOW SEVERAL PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA WHO HAVE STARTED FASTING ONLY IN THE PAST FEW </p><p>YEARS.  EVERYONE WE KNOW, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WHO NORMALLY </p><p>IMBIBES ALCOHOL, GIVES IT UP FOR THE MONTH, AS WELL AS </p><p>CIGARETTES DURING THE FASTING HOURS (THE LATTER IS PROBABLY </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE HEAVY SMOKING EGYPTIANS).  THE GOE </p><p>DECREE REGARDING THE SALE OF ALCOHOL DURING RAMADAN--IN </p><p>GENERAL, IT IS ONLY SOLD IN "TOURISTIC" HOTELS OR </p><p>RESTAURANTS, AND THEN ONLY TO FOREIGNERS--WAS SEVERELY </p><p>ENFORCED IN ALEXANDRIA THIS YEAR.  THE GREEK CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>INVITED A VISITING DELEGATION FROM GREECE TO DINE AT A </p><p>LOCAL RESTAURANT, OWNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALEXANDRIA </p><p>GREEK COMMUNITY.  THE RESTAURANT HAS A RAMADAN ALCOHOL </p><p>PERMIT.  DURING THE MEAL, A GENERAL INTELLIGENCE(MUKHABARAT) </p><p>OFFICER CAME INTO THE RESTAURANT, OBSERVED THE WINE BEING </p><p>SERVED TO THE GREEKS, AND ORDERED THE GREEK OWNER TO </p><p>APPEAR AT MUKHABARAT HEADQUARTERS THE NEXT DAY.  DURING </p><p>THEIR MEETING, THE RESTAURANT OWNER WAS TOLD THAT, EVEN </p><p>WITH A PERMIT, IF HE SERVED ALCOHOL DURING RAMADAN, THE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WOULD FIND "OTHER" WAYS TO PUT </p><p>"PRESSURE" ON HIM.  THE RAMADA, CURRENTLY ALEXANDRIA\'S </p><p>BEST HOTEL, VOLUNTARILY DID NOT SERVE ALCOHOL DURING </p><p>RAMADAN, BUT HAD A SMALL BAR DISCREETLY SET UP IN AN </p><p>UPSTAIRS SUITE FOR FOREIGNERS.  THE MANAGER TOLD US </p><p>THAT, IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE, HE FELT HIS DECISION WAS </p><p>"GOOD FOR BUSINESS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  QUALITY OF LIFE--AND CIVIL DISTURBANCES:  THE CITY\'S </p><p>GROWING PROBLEMS WITH PROVIDING SERVICES FOR ITS 3 </p><p>MILLION INHABITANTS BECOME AGGRAVATED DURING RAMADAN, </p><p>DUE BOTH TO THE INFLUX OF VISITORS DURING THE FEAST </p><p>FITLOWING RAMADAN, AND TO THE DEPLORABLE WORK HABITS OF </p><p>FASTING CITY EMPLOYEES.  ELECTRICAL AND WATER OUTAGES </p><p>WERE FREQUENT DURING RAMADAN, AND GARBAGE PICK-UP, A </p><p>CONTINUING, MAJOR PROBLEM HERE, ALMOST STOPPED TOWARD </p><p>THE END OF MONTH (AND THROUGHOUT THE SIX-DAY FEAST AT </p><p>THE END OF RAMADAN).  THAT, COMBINED WITH HOT WEATHER AND </p><p>BAD TEMPERS PRODUCED BY THE FASTING, PROBABLY LED TO THE </p><p>NUMEROUS CIVIL DISTURBANCES, LARGE AND SMALL, THE CITY </p><p>WITNESSED DURING THE MONTH.  AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS ARE </p><p>FREQUENT, AS ARE STREET FIGHTS OVER THE SLIGHTEST SCRAPE: </p><p>ONE CONGEN OFFICER REPORTED SEEING TWO STREET BRAWLS WITHIN </p><p>ONE BLOCK.  THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL MAJOR INCIDENTS BEFORE </p><p>THE END OF THE MONTH, ATTRIBUTABLE TO "RAMADAN CONDITIONS" </p><p>BY MOST ACCOUNTS: </p><p> </p><p>(A)  COPTIC-MUSLIM BRAWL:  DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE, </p><p>THERE WAS A MAJOR FIGHT BETWEEN COPTS AND MUSLIMS AT A </p><p>WHOLESALE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MARKET IN THE NOUZA AREA </p><p>OF ALEXANDRIA.  WE HAVE HAD TWO VERSIONS FROM POLICE </p><p>SOURCES AS TO HOW IT STARTED:  ONE ALLEGES THAT A COPTIC </p><p>MERCHANT OR CUSTOMER WAS MAKING A"SHOW" OF EATING AND </p><p>SMOKING IN FRONT OF FASTING MUSLIMS.  ANOTHER VERSION </p><p>SAYS THAT THERE WAS A SIMPLE DISPUTE, BUT WHEN THE TWO </p><p>CONTENDERS REALIZED THAT ONE WAS COPTIC AND THE OTHER </p><p>MUSLIM, A MELEE BEGAN, WITH BYSTANDERS JOINING IN.  OUR </p><p>STATE SECURITY SOURCES CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE 15 </p><p>ARRESTS AND 4 HOSPITALIZED; TWO CARS WERE BURNED AND ONE </p><p>HOUSE OR SHOP DESTROYED.  COMMENT:  AS COPTIC CONTACTS </p><p>HAVE NOT APPROACHED US ON THIS INCIDENT, WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT RELIGIOUSLY-INSPIRED AND SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE VIEWED AS "SECTARIAN STRIFE"--BUT MERELY AN </p><p>EXPLOSION OF TEMPERS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(B)  MURDER IN LABAN:  THERE IS A TRADITION IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>OF FOOTBALL GAMES IN THE STREETS DURING RAMADAN, EVEN </p><p>MAJOR THOROUGHFARES (MAKING TRAFFIC EVEN MORE OF A BLOOD </p><p>SPORT), IN THE LAST HOUR BEFORE THE "MEDFAA"--THE CANNON </p><p>WHICH IS FIRED TO SIGNAL THE END OF THE FASTING PERIOD. </p><p>IN THE WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF LABAN, MEMBER OF THE GOE\'S </p><p>ELITE CENTRAL SECURITY FORCES, UNABLE TO GET A GAME STOPPED </p><p>IN FRONT OF HIS ABODE, TOOK HIS GUN AND SHOT ONE OF THE </p><p>PLAYERS.  WHEN THE YOUNG MAN DIDN\'T DIE IMMEDIATELY, HE </p><p>SHOT HIM A SECOND TIME, WITH THE HORRIFIED FATHER STANDING </p><p>BY, ACCORDING TO OUR POLICE SOURCES.  THE CSF MEMBER IS </p><p>NOW IN PRISON, BUT TEMPERS ARE RAW IN LABAN. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  KNIFE FIGHT IN MANCHIA:  OUR INFORMATION IS SKETCHIER </p><p>ON THIS INCPQENT, BUT IT APGEARS THAT ZEALOUS CUSTOMS </p><p>POLICE, IN A VERY INFREQUENT APPLICATION OF LAW 119 </p><p>(1978)--WHICH ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE PROFITS ON IMPORTED </p><p>ITEMS AMONG THE IMPORTER, WHOLESALER AND RETAILER--VISITED </p><p>SHOPOWNERS TO LOOK AT THEIR BOOKS.  THE MANCHIA SHOPS </p><p>WERE FULL OF IMPORTED ITEMS AS RAMADAN, WHEN SALES APPROACH </p><p>THOSE AT CHRISTMASTIME IN THE U.S., IS THE TIME WHEN </p><p>RETAILERS MAKE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THEIR YEARLY </p><p>PROFITS.  THE CUSTOMS POLICE DEPARTED, BUT WHEN THEY </p><p>RETURNED THE SHOPOWNERS WERE WAITING FOR THEM WITH KNIVES. </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS KILLED, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE </p><p>QUITE A FEW INJURED DURING THE ENSUING KNIFE FIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THESE THREE INCIDENTS SHOULD PROPERLY </p><p>BE LABELLED "CIVIL DISTURBANCES," ALEXANDRIA\'S SECURITY </p><p>FORCES WERE ON A STATE OF ALERT (ALL LEAVES CANCELLED) </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE FEAST WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN.  THE CITY </p><p>EXPECTED VIOLENCE, OR AT LEAST PROHIBITED MARCHES, BY </p><p>MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS DURING THE SIX-DAY BAIRAM HOLIDAY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE FIRST MORNING.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE LEARNED </p><p>OF NO VIOLENCE, THERE WERE, INDEED, FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING SOME IN CONTRAVENTION OF GOE </p><p>DECREES) AND THOSE WILL BE ADDED IN THE SECOND MESSAGE </p><p>IN THIS SERIES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COOK </p><p></p></div>
