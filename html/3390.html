<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ AND THE JORDANIAN POPULACE\'S MOOD DOMINATE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S COURTESY CALL ON FORMER PM MUDAR BADRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 03620 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY.  On July 23 Ambassador paid a courtesy call on </p><p>former PM Mudar Badran at his residence in Abdoun.  The </p><p>substantive issues dominating the meeting were Iraq, the </p><p>Jordanian economy, the ongoing violence in the West Bank, and </p><p>the linkage between the three.  Badran was clear in his </p><p>opinion that, in the face of the economic conditions here and </p><p>the ongoing violence in the West Bank, any effort by the US </p><p>military to remove Saddam Hussein could dangerously enrage </p><p>the Jordanian populace.  In this context, Badran made </p><p>references to the events of 1970 and the potential for such </p><p>instability to be revisited.  Badran is not connected in any </p><p>way with the current regime in Jordan and is neither </p><p>consulted nor informed by the GOJ with regard to current </p><p>events.  That said, his long view of local and regional </p><p>history make his opinions notable.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Mudar Badran is an East Banker whose government </p><p>service spanned from 1958 (when he began his career as a </p><p>legal adviser to the Jordanian Armed Forces) to 1991, when he </p><p>completed his fourth stint as PM.  Among other positions, he </p><p>was Director of the General Intelligence Directorate from </p><p>1968 to 1970.  Between 1976 and 1991, Badran was PM for a </p><p>total of eight years, often serving concurrently as Minister </p><p>of Foreign Affairs and/or Defense.  In 1991 he was appointed </p><p>a member of the Senate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE ECONOMY, THE WEST BANK AND IRAQ:  THIS IS NOT 1991 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Following pleasantries, Badran jumped to the issue of </p><p>Iraq.  He contrasted the current domestic situation in Jordan </p><p>vis a vis 1991, identifying poverty and the local perception </p><p>of a stagnant economy as the key issues currently facing the </p><p>GOJ.  When he was PM in 1991, poverty was not rampant; there </p><p>was hope, and expectations, for a better economy.  Badran </p><p>pointed out that this is not the case today, as Jordanians </p><p>are increasingly disenchanted, and the GOJ is slipping </p><p>towards an adversarial posture with the Jordanian populace. </p><p>In 1991, he said, things between the GOJ and the people were </p><p>not "personal".  Now, increasingly, they are.  After </p><p>illustrating this contrast, Badran commented that the </p><p>domestic situations in Egypt and Saudi Arabia were, in his </p><p>opinion, even more tenuous, largely because those regimes\' </p><p>relationships with the USG were irritating their respective </p><p>populaces. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Badran said that most Jordanians do not like Saddam </p><p>Hussein and recognize him as an unjust ruler.  However, the </p><p>perception among Jordanians is that the economy will suffer </p><p>from a USG strike against Iraq, putting into jeopardy their </p><p>oil supply.  Further, Jordanian-Palestinians in particular </p><p>view the 12 year isolation of Iraq, at the hand of the USG, </p><p>as unjust.  The strength of Saddam, Badran said, is his </p><p>adversarial relationship with the US; in the third world, </p><p>leaders often need to be able to point a finger at an outside </p><p>force in order to survive.  Badran said that Saddam has, </p><p>unfortunately, been provided with this by the USG.  The Iraqi </p><p>people, and many Arabs in the region, Badran asserted, hold </p><p>the USG responsible for everything and anything bad that </p><p>happens in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Ambassador asked Badran what would happen in Jordan </p><p>if the USG did move against the Iraqi regime.  Badran said </p><p>that there is much uncertainty, and this in itself is not </p><p>good.  He cautioned that the security forces and </p><p>infrastructure surrounding Saddam were in his direct control </p><p>and "complex".  Within Jordan, Badran said that he is </p><p>convinced that the GOJ is "not at all able to face this </p><p>problem".  Ambassador asked if Badran believed that, in a </p><p>worst case scenario, the GOJ would be able to maintain </p><p>domestic stability.  Badran replied, "I doubt it".  The </p><p>economy is a very serious issue now, Badran continued.  He </p><p>mentioned his experience as GID Director during Black </p><p>September in 1970, and salted the discussion with some </p><p>allusions to the domestic conditions at that time.  Note: </p><p>Badran did not discuss the potential benefits that a </p><p>Saddam-free region could have in creating greater economic </p><p>opportunities in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>"WHAT HAPPENED TO US"? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Badran was not pleased with some of the recent </p><p>tactics of the current GOJ regime.  He became visibly upset </p><p>as he discussed the recent case of Toujan Faisal (reftel). </p><p>"What happened to us"?, he asked, referring presumably to the </p><p>GOJ.  The current PM is a friend, Badran said, "but what is </p><p>the government doing chasing down a former Member of </p><p>Parliament because she criticized it"?  This had only made </p><p>her allegations more visible, he said. He concluded that </p><p>previous regimes would not have wasted their time with such </p><p>matters. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7 (C)  Badran is an elderly former PM, disconnected from the </p><p>current regime.  This may well color his attitudes and </p><p>appraisals.  However, he was directly involved in the GOJ </p><p>leadership from 1970 through the Gulf War, and with this </p><p>experience is able to offer a valuable perspective.  His </p><p>major point: pessimism over limited economic opportunities </p><p>for the average Jordanian and the ongoing violence across the </p><p>river will add fuel to an angry popular rejection of any move </p><p>against Iraq.  He sees this as potentially a genuine </p><p>challenge to the security forces ability to keep order in the </p><p>event of a crises with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
