<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT  -- GOVERNMENT-OWNED NEWSPAPER </p><p>COMPANY SUSPENDED FROM STOCK EXCHANGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) has suspended </p><p>    Zimbabwe\'s largest newspaper and publishing company, </p><p>    the government-controlled Zimbabwe Newspapers </p><p>    (Zimpapers) Group.  The company, publishers of "The </p><p>    Herald" and five other titles, was suspended on </p><p>    Monday, July 2 for violating the bourse\'s regulations. </p><p>    The Government of Zimbabwe owns 51 percent of </p><p>    Zimpapers shares and exercises tight editorial control </p><p>    over the company\'s newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>2.   According to ZSE chief executive officer Emmanuel </p><p>    Munyukwi the suspension is the result of Zimpapers\' </p><p>    failure to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) and </p><p>    submit an audited financial statement.  Munyuki said </p><p>    the suspension was to "safeguard the shareholders." </p><p> </p><p>3.   A Zimpapers spokesman said the delay in producing </p><p>    an audited financial statement and presenting it to </p><p>    shareholders was due to "capacity inadequacies."  He </p><p>    also blamed a disagreement between Zimpapers and its </p><p>    auditors over whether to use the official (Z$55=US$1) </p><p>    or parallel (Z$650=US$1) exchange rate in assessing </p><p>    the burden of Zimpapers\' 500,000 British pound debt to </p><p>    an UK-based computer company.  The spokesman said that </p><p>    these problems would be resolved and the company\'s </p><p>    shares would be trading again by July 5. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Comment:  Zimpapers\' unaudited financial report </p><p>    was published in May to great fanfare in the </p><p>    government-owned newspapers.  The unaudited report </p><p>    showed a $Z30 million profit in 2001 in the wake of a </p><p>    $71 million loss in 2000.  Given the continuing </p><p>    decline of both circulation and advertising among </p><p>    government-owned papers, the upbeat May financial </p><p>    report raised questions.  Zimpapers\' explanation of </p><p>    its suspension from the ZSE answered some of those </p><p>    questions.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
