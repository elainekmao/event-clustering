(SBU) Summary:  Over the past week, garment manufacturers </p><p>have been in negotiations with leaders of the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated trade union.  The Maoists have requested a </p><p>dramatic increase in salaries and permanent employment.  The </p><p>Maoists have issued vague threats to pressure the garment </p><p>manufacturers to accede.  The Maoists\' recent use of trade </p><p>unions may indicate a new urban political strategy.  It </p><p>appears that the Maoists have not yet sought cooperation from </p><p>mainstream trade unions.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Over the past week, members of the Garment </p><p>Association of Nepal (GAN) have been in negotiations with </p><p>leaders of the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal Trade Union </p><p>Federation.  According to GAN President Kiran Saakha the </p><p>Maoists have requested a dramatic increase in monthly </p><p>salaries (from USD 30 to USD 78) and an end to the use of </p><p>temporary workers by demanding that garment manufacturers </p><p>bring such workers onto the permanent payroll.  The recent </p><p>Maoist activism on behalf of garment workers echoes demands </p><p>made in August 2001 (ref A).  Rather than threaten immediate </p><p>strikes, the Maoist trade union negotiators prefaced their </p><p>demands with threats; they claimed responsibility for the </p><p>slaying of Inspector General of Police Shrestha (ref B) and </p><p>stated they could make doing business very difficult.  The </p><p>Maoist negotiators claimed that as they occupy ninety-eight </p><p>percent of the country\'s territory, they should be extended </p><p>the same respect the manufacturers give the Government of </p><p>Nepal.  Despite the threatening overtones, a special </p><p>committee of the GAN has engaged them in dialogue for five </p><p>days without the Maoists calling a strike or threatening </p><p>specific harm to the companies. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Calls by the Embassy\'s political specialist to </p><p>spokespersons of the two largest trade unions, the General </p><p>Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (affiliated with the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist) and the </p><p>Nepal Trade Union Congress (affiliated with the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party), revealed that they were completely unaware </p><p>of the Maoist trade union\'s demands. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  These recent actions by the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated trade union may represent an evolving urban </p><p>strategy.  This strategy may have been tested first by the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated student union, which appropriated existing </p><p>grievances of the mainstream student unions and led them into </p><p>the streets (ref C and D).  Similarly, the Maoist trade union </p><p>has taken up complaints of low-pay and employment insecurity </p><p>and may utilize them to try to garner broad appeal.  Given </p><p>the mainstream trade unions\' lack of awareness of the Maoist </p><p>campaign, a "joint movement" of the trade unions--similar to </p><p>that conducted by the student wings--seems unlikely in the </p><p>coming weeks. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
