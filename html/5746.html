<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000342 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:02/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA\'S OBASANJO ON ARTICLE 98 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Accompanied by AF DAS Bridgewater and DCM, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter February 14 urged Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>to conclude an Article 98 Agreement with the US.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter stressed that the Rome Statute specifically provided for </p><p>such bilateral accords and pointed out that Nigeria, as the </p><p>major force in African PKOs, might want to consider concluding </p><p>Article 98 Agreements with countries in the region.  The US </p><p>could not accept an international arrangement that subjected </p><p>its service members to the jurisdiction of a body established </p><p>by a treaty to which the US was not Party.  He had already </p><p>discussed Article 98 with National Security Adviser Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed, Attorney-General Kanu Agabi and Minister of Defense </p><p>T.Y. Danjuma, the Ambassador added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) After listening to the Ambassador\'s presentation, </p><p>Obasanjo instructed his International Affairs Advisor, Ad\'Obe </p><p>Obe (who was sitting in) to consider an Article 98 Agreement, </p><p>specifically asking Obe to discuss it with Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Sule Lamido. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  Ambassador Jeter began the discussion of </p><p>Article 98 by noting that the USG was not a Party to the Rome </p><p>Statute.  "It is a pity you are not," Obasanjo had rejoined. </p><p>However, as the Ambassador described the ICC\'s reach and the </p><p>risk it posed to Nigerian troops on peacekeeping duty, the </p><p>Nigerian President took notice.  At one point, Obasanjo </p><p>commented that an "International Criminal Court is fine for </p><p>drug traffickers, money launderers and the like, but I\'m not </p><p>sure it\'s right for the military."  Foreign Minister Lamido </p><p>and the MFA bureaucracy will likely oppose an Article 98 </p><p>Agreement, but retired General Obasanjo is now interested to </p><p>know how the interests of Nigerian service members can be </p><p>protected.  The Mission will continue to pursue conclusion of </p><p>an Article 98 Agreement with Nigeria vigorously but carefully. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ambassador Bridgewater cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
