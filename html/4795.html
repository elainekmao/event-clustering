(U) Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) officials opened </p><p>financial bids for the privatization of five state-owned </p><p>enterprises (SOEs) December 12 at the NICON Hilton Hotel in </p><p>Abuja: National Trucks Manufacturers, Savannah Sugar, </p><p>Caterers Court (apartments), Nigeria Re-Insurance, and Abuja </p><p>International Hotel (built for, but never operated, by </p><p>Sofitel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Art Engineering and Construction Limited--with </p><p>technical partners Chinese Civil Engineering and Construction </p><p>Corporation, China FAW Corporation, and Dongfeng </p><p>Corporation--bid $6.4 million for a 51 percent share in </p><p>National Trucks Manufacturers. The reserve bidder was Danata </p><p>Investment and Security Company Limited, with technical </p><p>partner Eicher Group of India. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Dangote Industries Limited was named the preferred </p><p>bidder for a 51 percent share in Savanah Sugar, with an offer </p><p>of $6.3 million. Sahara Energy Resource bid $5.1 million for </p><p>Caterers Court and was named the preferred bidder. </p><p>Reinsurance Acquisition Group Limited made a winning bid of </p><p>$7.8 million for 51 percent of Nigeria Re-Insurance. Both </p><p>bidders on Abuja International Hotel were disqualified for </p><p>failure to pay a mandatory $2 million bid bond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The opening of the financial bids was the third in a </p><p>four-step privatization process. The first was a </p><p>prequalification exercise that BPE conducted based on </p><p>potential investors\' expressions of interest. Next, BPE </p><p>reviewed the technical bids of those investors who were </p><p>prequalified. The fourth step is for each winning bidder to </p><p>pay the full bid price to the BPE, based on a payment </p><p>schedule negotiated between BPE and each bidder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Comment: It is this fourth step, payment of the </p><p>winning bid price, where the privatization process often </p><p>breaks down. Privatization of Nigeria Telecommunication </p><p>Limited (NITEL), Niger Dock, and more recently the NICON </p><p>Hilton Hotel failed because winning bidders could not come up </p><p>with the funds to pay their bid prices. Septel will provide </p><p>more details on the privatization process. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Plans for Debt Management in 2003 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO) </p><p>Akin Arikawe on December 9 told Econoff that, after a </p><p>difficult year for debt repayment in 2002 due to budget </p><p>shortfalls, the GON plans to buydown all non-Paris Club debt </p><p>in 2003 and reschedule Paris Club debt in 2003 or 2004. </p><p>Decreased government revenues--together with confusion over </p><p>the division of Paris Club debt among the States and Federal </p><p>Government--means the GON will pay only $900 million of the </p><p>$1.5 billion budgeted for external debt in 2002. Arikawe says </p><p>the GON will use that $900 million to stay current with its </p><p>London Club, multilateral, and promissory note debt, but will </p><p>probably make no further Paris Club payments this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The Central Bank has agreed to release $500 million </p><p>from the 2003 budget early so the GON can buy back most of </p><p>its London Club debt (par bonds) this year. This will reduce </p><p>next year\'s payment for this item from $130 million to </p><p>approximately $25 million. The Bank hopes for a similar </p><p>auction of promissory notes to reduce non-Paris Club annual </p><p>debt payments to approximately $400 million. Arikawe says </p><p>this scheme would leave the GON with about $1 billion to use </p><p>in its rescheduled debt payment program with the Paris Club. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Comment: Arikawe may be overly optimistic (Ref. A). </p><p>There is a certain logic to his strategy, but it hinges on </p><p>budgetary discipline as well as the acquiescence of Paris </p><p>Club debtors to standing at the back of the line of Nigerian </p><p>creditors. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Backroom Deals May Derail Another Motorola Bid </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>10. (SBU) Motorola Country Director for Nigeria Raphael </p><p>Udeogu expressed to Econoff concern that his company\'s $230 </p><p>million bid to expand Nigeria Telecommunication Limited\'s </p><p>(NITEL) GSM infrastructure is not being treated fairly by the </p><p>GON. He claimed that NITEL initially disqualified two of six </p><p>companies competing for the contract--Siemens and Huawei--for </p><p>improper bid submission. Meanwhile, NITEL disclosed technical </p><p>and financial details from the four remaining bids. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) A few days later, NITEL re-instated the German and </p><p>Chinese companies\' bids. According to Udeogu, NITEL officials </p><p>first gave the flimsy excuse that the bids were reinstated </p><p>because necessary forms could not be properly downloaded from </p><p>the internet. Later, when that explanation lost credibility, </p><p>officials simply said "the decision was from above," implying </p><p>the hand of the Minister of Communications Mohammed Bello. </p><p>Udeogu reports that NITEL purposefully modified contract </p><p>requirements to use Siemens\' proprietary technology for some </p><p>technical specifications, giving that company a tremendous </p><p>and unfair advantage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Udeogu expects NITEL to announce the shortlist for </p><p>the contract in early January. He predicts NITEL will divide </p><p>the contract award among several companies, with the largest </p><p>share going to Siemens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Pursuant to Motorola\'s request, Post continues to </p><p>provide advocacy assistance for this bid. In a letter to </p><p>President Obasanjo dated December 2, Ambassador Jeter made an </p><p>overture for improved transparency in the privatization and </p><p>regulation of the telecommunications sector, specifically </p><p>mentioning the concerns of U.S. companies such as Motorola. </p><p>(Note: A copy of this letter has been faxed to AF/W. End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Central Bank Scolds Banks on Lending Practices </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>14. (U) Local press reported that ten banks will contest the </p><p>Central Bank over the latter\'s order that the banks refund </p><p>about 524 million naira ($4 million) to African Petroleum </p><p>Plc. (AP) for excess charges on loans to AP at a time when </p><p>that company was clearly a poor credit risk. AP has since </p><p>declared bankruptcy. A December 8 article in the Lagos-based </p><p>"Vanguard" newspaper said the Central Bank calculated these </p><p>charges amounted to 524 million naira on a 14 billion naira </p><p>($108 million) credit facility extended to AP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) While the "Vanguard" implicated 17 financial </p><p>institutions, a senior banking executive told Lagos Econoffs </p><p>that two additional institutions are involved. Our source </p><p>stated that some institutions extended credit to AP exceeding </p><p>30 percent of their shareholder capital, thus contravening </p><p>Central Bank regulations. Our source added that some of the </p><p>credit was disguised as off-balance-sheet financing in the </p><p>form of loan commitments or guarantees that do not add debt </p><p>on a balance sheet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Our source reports another alarming aspect of these </p><p>transactions on which the Central Bank has not yet focused: </p><p>AP denies owing 11 billion ($85 million) of the 14 billion </p><p>naira credit facility extended to it. Essentially, that 11 </p><p>billion naira is missing. Our source added that one of AP\'s </p><p>former principals now has about $37 million in two accounts </p><p>managed by a large U.S. investment firm, implying that some </p><p>of the missing 11 billion naira may be found there. A second </p><p>source says that both AP executives and banking principals </p><p>may have benefited from these transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Comment: Given the Central Bank\'s punitive leverage </p><p>over the financial sector and its willingness to use that </p><p>authority (Ref. D), the banks will likely repay AP rather </p><p>than risk sanctions. This controversy may presage a more </p><p>active role by the Central Bank in rectifying banks\' improper </p><p>lending practices. However, we would not be surprised to see </p><p>those involved call in political favors to see that Central </p><p>Bank investigators are held at bay. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Supreme Court Says States Control Local Gov\'t Funding </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>18. (U) The Nigerian Supreme Court in a December 13 unanimous </p><p>decision ruled that revenue now being passed directly to the </p><p>local governments by the federal government must first pass </p><p>through state governments. This will further strengthen the </p><p>political and economic control of state governors and weaken </p><p>central government influence over local government. In a blow </p><p>to states\' attempts to enhance their revenues, however, the </p><p>Supreme Court rejected states\' claim to a percentage of </p><p>proceeds from privatization, stamp sales, and other federal </p><p>government activities. </p><p>19. (U) Comment: Despite the April 5 Supreme Court decision </p><p>on resource and revenue allocation (Refs. C and E), </p><p>implementation has been slow and marked by efforts by "the </p><p>losers" on any given revenue allocation issue to restore the </p><p>status quo ante. There will be numerous political fights </p><p>before these issues are finally settled, so the financial </p><p>impact of these two rulings cannot yet be assessed. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
