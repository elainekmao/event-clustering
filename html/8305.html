(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Richard A. </p><p>Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) Deputy </p><p>Managing Director Khalifa Al-Kindi queried DCM during a </p><p>5/19 courtesy call about the future of Iraq and the roadmap </p><p>for peace between Israel and the PA.  Clearly pleased by </p><p>the outcome of the war in Iraq, Al-Kindi admitted that he </p><p>had purchased the "Iraqi Deck Of Cards" from the Internet, </p><p>and excused himself from the meeting to retrieve the deck </p><p>in his office.  Al-Kindi noted that a dozen of the cards </p><p>were without pictures of senior Baath officials -- "No </p><p>wonder you haven\'t been able to catch them!"  Al-Kindi was </p><p>pleased that the USG had turned its attention back to </p><p>Israel and Palestine with the recent unveiling of the </p><p>roadmap for peace.  Al-Kindi asked several reiterations of </p><p>the same question about the feasibility of the USG plan, </p><p>and seemed to seek DCM\'s assurances that Washington would </p><p>deliver peace to the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: Like many of our Emirati contacts, Al- </p><p>Kindi displayed polite indifference toward us prior to the </p><p>war, and his skepticism about U.S. initiatives in the </p><p>region was evident in earlier meetings.  This meeting with </p><p>Al-Kindi, however, was a marked difference -- he seemed </p><p>elated that the war was over and that Coalition forces had </p><p>removed Saddam from power.  Nevertheless, his body language </p><p>and persistent questioning both about the future of Iraq </p><p>and the peace process revealed concern as to whether we can </p><p>make good on our promises and a desire to believe us.  Many </p><p>of our senior interlocutors feel the same way.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
