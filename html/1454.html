(SBU) As reported (Ref), Presidential Cabinet Director </p><p>Georges Buse phoned the Ambassador evening of December 26 to </p><p>inform him that President Kabila had instructed him to lead a </p><p>Congolese (DRC) government delegation to the US to hold </p><p>discussions with the administration of President-elect Bush. </p><p>Minister of Justice Mwenze Kongolo would also be a member of </p><p>the delegation, Buse said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ambassador said that he would report Buse\'s </p><p>conversation to Washington and share with him any response. </p><p>The Ambassador reminded Director Buse that the transition had </p><p>only recently begun and the inauguration was still some three </p><p>weeks away.  He pointed out the added complexity of arranging </p><p>meetings in a transition between administrations.  He also </p><p>urged Buse to seek the assistance of the Congolese Ambassador </p><p>in Washington with regard to the delegation\'s visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Morning of December 27, the Ambassador met with </p><p>Foreign Minister Okitundu to inform him, inter alia, of </p><p>Buse\'s phone call.  Okitundu gave the impression that this </p><p>was the first time he had heard of this particular </p><p>delegation; he did say, however, that there had been </p><p>considerable discussion in Presidential circles about an </p><p>early visit to make their case on the Congo war to the new US </p><p>administration, probably after the Presidential inauguration. </p><p> Okitundu volunteered that he would himself speak to Director </p><p>Buse and Minister Mwenze today about the delegation and the </p><p>timing for the visit.  He would thereafter be in further </p><p>touch with the Ambassador. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
