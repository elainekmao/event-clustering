<p>UNCLAS ROME 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, CARNES </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p> </p><p>    E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI FINANCIAL DEBT TO ITALY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (SBU) DESPITE ITALIAN MEDIA CLAIMS THAT IRAQI DEBT </p><p>TO ITALY IS E7 BILLION, GOI OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US THAT </p><p>THE AMOUNT IS CLOSER TO E1.3 BILLION.  MOST OF THE DEBT </p><p>RELATES TO A MID-1980S IRAQI ORDER OF FOUR FRIGATES, </p><p>WHICH WERE NEVER DELIVERED BECAUSE OF A SUBSEQUENT UN </p><p>EMBARGO.  THE GOI ASSUMED THE COST OF THESE FRIGATES. </p><p>WHILE NO OFFICIAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, GOI OFFICIALS </p><p>INDICATE THAT THIS DEBT WILL LIKELY BE FORGIVEN WHEN A </p><p>NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) IN A MARCH 20TH ARTICLE, THE ITALIAN FINANCIAL </p><p>DAILY MF CLAIMED THAT IRAQI DEBT TO ITALY TOTALED E7 </p><p>BILLION, A CLAIM AND FIGURE THAT WERE PICKED UP BY MOST </p><p>MAJOR ITALIAN NEWSPAPERS. THE MF JOURNALIST APPARENTLY </p><p>LUMPED TOGETHER TWO OUTSTANDING DEBTS  ONE RELATING TO </p><p>THE ORDER OF FOUR WARSHIPS, THE SECOND TO THE VALUE OF </p><p>A FUND ILLEGALLY GRANTED TO IRAQ BY A MAJOR ITALIAN </p><p>BANK, BANCA NAZIONALE DEL LAVORO (BNL).  REGARDING THE </p><p>LATTER, THE ATLANTA OFFICE OF BNL ISSUED A FUND VALUED </p><p>AT E2.6 BILLION FOR THE FINANCING OF ARMS PURCHASES TO </p><p>IRAQ IN 1986. U.S. COURTS RULED THE FUND ISSUANCE WAS </p><p>ILLEGAL. ITALY ALSO RULED THAT THE CREDIT WAS ILLEGAL </p><p>SINCE AT THAT TIME, ITALY HAD PLACED AN EMBARGO ON IRAQ </p><p>UNTIL OUTSTANDING DEBT FOR THE FOUR FRIGATES WAS PAID. </p><p>IRAQ NEVER RE-PAID THE FUND.  BNL WROTE OFF THIS DEBT </p><p>    MANY YEARS AGO (1993-1995). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE MORE SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF IRAQ DEBT </p><p>RELATES TO FOUR LUPO FRIGATES (SMALL WARSHIPS) </p><p>S) </p><p>ORDERED BY IRAQ IN 1981 BUT NEVER DELIVERED BECAUSE OF </p><p>IRAN/IRAQ WAR FIRST AND THE UN EMBARGO LATER.  THE </p><p>FRIGATES REACHED ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT AND TUNIS, BUT NEVER </p><p>REACHED THE IRAQI PORT OF UM QASR. IRAQ REFUSED TO PAY </p><p>FOR THE FRIGATES.  AS A RESULT OF THIS DISPUTE, </p><p>FINCANTIERI (THE GOI-CONTROLLED SHIPYARD COMPANY THAT </p><p>BUILT THE FRIGATES) SUFFERED A NET LOSS OF TWO TRILLION </p><p>LIRE  (APPROXIMATELY USD 1.5 BILLION).  THE COST OF </p><p>MAINTAINING THE FOUR FRIGATES IN THE ITALIAN PORT OF LA </p><p>SPEZIA FROM 1986-1991 REACHED 660 MILLION LIRE </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY USD 500,000), WHICH WAS BORNE BY THE </p><p>GOI.  IN 1991, THE SIX WARSHIPS WERE SOLD TO THE </p><p>ITALIAN NAVY, WHICH MEANT AN ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY </p><p>BURDEN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT ALSO WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY </p><p>ONE TRILLION LIRE (APPROX. USD 770 MILL) TO COMPANIES </p><p>(SUCH AS OTOMELARA, AGUSTA, BREDA MECCANICA, AND </p><p>IDICIMA) THAT PROVIDED WEAPONS AND SOPHISTICATED </p><p>TELECOM EQUIPMENT ON THE FRIGATES.  THE OVERALL LOSS </p><p>WOULD BE ESTIMATED AT ABOUT 5 TRILLION IN 1986 LIRE </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY USD 3.3 BILLION) OR ABOUT E4.5 BILLION </p><p>IN TODAYS TERMS.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE E2.6 BILLION </p><p>BNL CREDIT TO IRAQ WOULD CORRESPOND TO AN OVERALL DEBT </p><p>POSITION OF E7 BILLION, THE FIGURE CLAIMED BY THE </p><p>FINANCIAL PAPER MF. </p><p></p><p>5. (SBU) GOI OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT THE E7 BILLION FIGURE </p><p>IS ERRONEOUS.  CARLO GUARINONI, HEAD OF STUDIES AND </p><p>ECONOMIC RESEARCH OF SACE (ITALIAN FOREIGN TRADE </p><p>INSURANCE SERVICES AGENCY) TOLD US THAT IRAQS OFFICIAL </p><p>IRAQI DEBT POSITION TO ITALY IS 1.4 BILLION EURO (USD </p><p>1.35 BILLION DOLLARS).  FILIPPO GIANSANTE, DIRECTOR OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEBT AT THE FINANCE MINISTRY CORROBORATED </p><p>THIS OFFICIAL FIGURE. GUARINONI TOLD US THAT ITALY, AS </p><p>A SIGN OF GOOD WILL WITH A NEW IRAQI ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>WOULD LIKELY FORGIVE THE OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO </p><p>THE FRIGATES. </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01344 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
