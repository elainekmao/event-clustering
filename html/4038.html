SUMMARY:  THE GENEVA GROUP DISCUSSED TERM LIMITS ON </p><p>OCTOBER 16.  GERMANY HAS REQUESTED THAT THE ISSUE BE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA OF THE FAO COUNCIL WHICH MEETS </p><p>OCTOBER 28 TO NOVEMBER 2.  ACCORDING TO THE GROUNDWORK </p><p>DONE BY DENMARK AS PRESIDENT OF THE EU, THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION TO THIS INITIATIVE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>FROM AFRICANS WHO SEE IT AS AN EFFORT TO UNSEAT THE </p><p>CURRENT AFRICAN DG.  MEMBERS APPLAUDED THE US DEMARCHE </p><p>AIMED AT SOFTENING RESISTANCE TO INCLUDING TERM LIMITS ON </p><p>THE AGENDA AND SOME OFFERED TO MAKE SIMILAR DEMARCHES TO </p><p>CAPITALS OF COUNCIL MEMBER COUNTRIES.  THE MOST DESIRABLE </p><p>OUTCOME OF DISCUSSION IN THE FAO COUNCIL WOULD BE </p><p>FORMATION OF AN OPEN ENDED WORKING GROUP TO DISCUSS </p><p>ISSUES RELATED TO TERM LIMITS: HOW MANY TERMS, WHEN </p><p>LIMITS WOULD TAKE EFFECT, AND SHORTENING THE LENGTH OF </p><p>TERMS.

THE GENEVA GROUP MET OCTOBER 16 TO DISCUSS TERM </p><p>LIMITS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP </p><p>AT THE FAO COUNCIL MEETING OCTOBER 28 TO NOVEMBER 2.  THE </p><p>EU REPRESENTATIVE (DENMARK\'S PERM REP) REPORTED ON </p><p>MEETINGS WITH ALL REGIONAL GROUPS IN FAO CONCERNING THE </p><p>PROPOSAL TO PLACE TERM LIMITS FOR THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ON </p><p>THE COUNCIL AGENDA.  THIS IS NECESSARY TO LAUNCH </p><p>DISCUSSION IN TIME FOR A DECISION BY THE FAO CONFERENCE </p><p>IN 2003.  THE OECD GROUP, INCLUDING EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA </p><p>(US AND CANADA) THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC (MAINLY AUSTRALIA </p><p>AND NEW ZEALAND) AND FROM ASIA, KOREA AND JAPAN, WERE IN </p><p>FAVOR.  THE LATIN AMERICA GROUP IS "OPEN TO DISCUSSION" </p><p>OF THE MATTER.  (COMMENT:  WE HAVE POINTED OUT TO THEM </p><p>THAT IF THE PRINCIPLE OF GEOGRAPHIC ROTATION IS </p><p>MAINTAINED, LATIN AMERICA WOULD BE IN LINE TO SELECT THE </p><p>NEXT DIRECTOR GENERAL.

THEY MAY ALSO FEAR THAT A NEW DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO SKEW THE PROGRAM EMPHASIS </p><p>OF FAO IN FAVOR OF AFRICA.  (THIS BIAS IS NOT WITHOUT </p><p>MERIT SINCE AFRICA NEEDS THE MOST HELP, BUT THERE ARE </p><p>MANY POOR FARMERS IN RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY OF OTHER </p><p>REGIONS WHO RECEIVE VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE.)  UGANDA, </p><p>SUPPORTED BY MAURITANIA, NIGERIA AND ERITREA THOUGHT THAT </p><p>TERM LIMITS WOULD BE POSITIVE FOR INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  MALI WAS THE MOST VOCAL OPPONENT.  HE SAID </p><p>THE ISSUE WOULD TAKE THE COUNCIL\'S TIME AND ATTENTION </p><p>AWAY FROM MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE FOLLOW-UP TO THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT: FIVE YEARS LATER AND THE MEDIUM TERM </p><p>PLAN.
