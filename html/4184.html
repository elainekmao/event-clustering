<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace talk reactions:  Tamils optimistic; </p><p>Opposition, no comment yet; Muslims temporarily appeased </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 2064 </p><p>-      (B) Reston VA dtg 041152Z Nov 02 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, DCM.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Reactions by Sri Lankans to the October </p><p>31 to November 3 peace talks in Thailand are generally </p><p>positive.  Muslim representatives raised some isolated </p><p>issues, but were satisfied that their concerns were </p><p>acknowledged during the second round of talks.  The </p><p>President\'s office claims that the inflammatory </p><p>statements attributed to her by the media were taken out </p><p>of context.  Tamil politicians were encouraged by the </p><p>agreements of the most recent talks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) One Muslim view:  MP M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, aligned </p><p>with the opposition People\'s Alliance (PA), commented </p><p>that the Muslim community was generally satisfied that </p><p>their concerns were acknowledged during the second </p><p>session of talks, which took place in Thailand from </p><p>October 31 to November 3.  Hizbullah did raise the </p><p>concern his constituency, Muslims in the east, has about </p><p>Sri Lankan Muslim Congress MP Rauf Hakeem being the </p><p>Muslim representative at the peace talks.  Hizbullah </p><p>concluded that Muslims no longer had confidence in </p><p>Hakeem and that the Muslim community should be </p><p>represented by someone else in future talks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Another Muslim view:  M.C.M. Iqbal, consultant to </p><p>the Law and Society Trust, a local think-tank, opined </p><p>that the fears of the Muslim community have been </p><p>temporarily allayed by the LTTE\'s easing off on the </p><p>demand for an interim administration (see Ref A).  The </p><p>recent statements by the LTTE showing an apparent </p><p>willingness to make some sacrifices to keep the peace </p><p>process moving, Iqbal believes, will give the Muslim </p><p>community some time to reassess their situation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) From the President\'s office:  On November 6, the </p><p>local press reported that President Kumaratunga recently </p><p>made inflammatory comments about the way the Government </p><p>is working with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE).  The President is quoted as saying, "the </p><p>government must disclose what it would concede to the </p><p>LTTE"; the LTTE "is now busy consolidating its hold on </p><p>the north and east", and that she would use her powers </p><p>when and if there was a threat to Sri Lanka\'s integrity. </p><p>Presidential Spokesman Harim Peiris stated that the </p><p>quotes were taken out of context.  He added that the </p><p>private meeting where she allegedly made these </p><p>statements may have contained some strong rhetoric, but </p><p>it was geared towards strengthening the morale of the </p><p>grassroots level activists.  Peiris repeated that the </p><p>President supports the peace process but will not make </p><p>an official statement until she is briefed by Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, one of the GSL\'s representatives at </p><p>the peace talks.  (See Ref A) </p><p> </p><p>5. The Tamil reaction:  Confirming the positive tones of </p><p>Ref B, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP V. Krishnapillai </p><p>summed up what he thought was the Tamil perspective by </p><p>saying "I am only one of many who want to see a peaceful </p><p>solution," and the talks are going in the right </p><p>direction.  He added that a solution should be found </p><p>within a short time and that there is no need for a </p><p>protracted process.  TNA MP T. Thangavadivel added that </p><p>he was very optimistic, partly because the TNA had been </p><p>informed by the LTTE that it would be invited to the </p><p>third session of talks. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
