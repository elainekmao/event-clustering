<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT, EB/ESC/ESP, EAP/PIMBS, EUR/ERA, EUR/UBI </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICE FOR DAAG SWARTZ AND OIA/JUDI FRIEDMAN </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KERBER, WONG, RICHARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, KCRM, PREL, CASC, ETTC, XG, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH COURT ACQUITS ISLAMIST TERRORIST SUSPECTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 THE HAGUE 03525 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: On June 5, the District Court of </p><p>Rotterdam acquitted all twelve suspects charged (under a </p><p>variety of statutes) for offenses related to the provision </p><p>of support to a terrorist organization.  This was the second </p><p>such loss for the government before the same court, </p><p>following the December 2002 acquittal of four men accused of </p><p>providing support in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in </p><p>Paris. In the new case, the presiding judge refused to allow </p><p>"unverified" intelligence information to serve as evidence </p><p>and disallowed the prosecution\'s use of "wartime" statutes </p><p>in a peacetime terrorism case.  The prosecutor\'s office </p><p>announced that it would appeal the decision because it </p><p>disagreed with the court\'s ruling on the use of </p><p>intelligence.  The outcome has strengthened political </p><p>support in the Netherlands for new laws giving prosecutors </p><p>new tools in terrorism cases.  Amb. Sobel has scheduled </p><p>meetings with the Justice Minister and attorney general to </p><p>accelerate existing bilateral cooperation aimed at </p><p>strengthening Dutch counterterrorism laws.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>A Catch-all of Charges </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Twelve alleged Muslim extremists, including five </p><p>Algerians, one Moroccan, one Mauritanian, one Iraqi, one </p><p>Libyan, one Egyptian and two Dutch nationals of Turkish and </p><p>Moroccan descent respectively, stood trial before the </p><p>Rotterdam District Court, Judge S.J. Van Klaveren presiding, </p><p>on May 12-20.  They were charged with participation in a </p><p>criminal organization, providing assistance to the enemy at </p><p>times of war, forging travel documents, people smuggling, </p><p>drug trafficking, violation of the Dutch Arms and Ammunition </p><p>Act, trafficking in identity documents, and forgery.  The </p><p>prosecution accused them of belonging to radical Islamic </p><p>networks and engaging in recruitment of young Muslims for </p><p>"Jihad." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) During the course of the trial, it became clear </p><p>that most of the charges could not be proven.  Prosecutor Jo </p><p>Valente was therefore obliged to take the unusual step of </p><p>dropping most of the charges before the trial concluded.  He </p><p>conceded that he could not prove most charges but that he </p><p>had nonetheless persevered because of "the seriousness of </p><p>the threat and impact of terrorist action on society."  He </p><p>argued that it was virtually impossible to corroborate </p><p>intelligence information as long as suspects do not carry </p><p>out their plans and refuse to talk.  He called the existence </p><p>of terrorist networks equally hard to prove, and complained </p><p>about disappointing intelligence cooperation with such </p><p>countries as France, Germany and Morocco.  There was no </p><p>doubt that most suspects embraced anti-western views and had </p><p>hardly any ties with Dutch society but the question was </p><p>whether it could be proven that they actually committed </p><p>criminal offenses. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Charges Not Proven </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4. (SBU) The Judge had no trouble reaching the same </p><p>conclusion - that most charges could not be proven.  The </p><p>judge opined that, although it had been established that </p><p>several defendants maintained contact with each other, it </p><p>did not appear from either statements that were made by the </p><p>defendants or intercepted telephone conversations or </p><p>material found during house searches that they were part of </p><p>a criminal organization.  Nor did he find compelling the </p><p>prosecution\'s evidence that this was in fact a "network" </p><p>organization.  He also dismissed the charge of "providing </p><p>assistance or attempting to provide assistance to the enemy </p><p>in time of war" because he said the Netherlands was not at </p><p>war with Afghanistan, the Taliban, Al Qaeda and/or other pro- </p><p>Taliban fighters during the period covered by the charges. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Consequently, he acquitted all suspects, with the </p><p>exception of two convicted for the possession of forged </p><p>documents, receiving prison sentences of two and four months </p><p>respectively.  Four suspects had already been released from </p><p>custody during the trial because they faced possible prison </p><p>sentences shorter than the time they had spent in pre-trial </p><p>detention.  The judge ordered the release of the others when </p><p>he issued his verdict.  Several of them, however, were </p><p>rearrested on charges of illegal immigration. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Limits on Intelligence in the Courtroom </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) The case turned in large part on the admissibility </p><p>of intelligence information. In a previous  case, the same </p><p>court acquitted four suspects on December 18, 2002 (reftel) </p><p>ruling the prosecutor had failed to corroborate intelligence </p><p>information.  It therefore came as no surprise that the </p><p>court again decided June 5 to acquit all suspects in light </p><p>of the absence of any substantive evidence to corroborate </p><p>intelligence information - the source of which the </p><p>government declined to reveal in court.  Judge Van Klaveren </p><p>explicitly ruled that intelligence information as such could </p><p>not serve as evidence of any charge unless its origin and </p><p>accuracy can be verified. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The prosecutor\'s office immediately announced that </p><p>it would file an appeal against the District Court\'s </p><p>decision because it disagreed with the court\'s ruling that </p><p>intelligence cannot be used as evidence.   Spokesmen for the </p><p>ruling Christian Democrat (CDA) and Liberal (VVD) parties as </p><p>well as the opposition Labor and populist List Pim Fortuyn </p><p>(LPF) parties opined that the law should be changed to </p><p>permit the use of intelligence information as evidence under </p><p>certain circumstances.  The party spokesmen also endorsed </p><p>the opinion voiced during the trial by Chief Attorney </p><p>General Joan de Wijkerslooth, in favor of making recruiting </p><p>for the "Jihad" a specific criminal offense in the Dutch </p><p>Criminal Code. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment:  Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner (who </p><p>supports use of intelligence in court proceedings) has </p><p>received his wake up call.  The outcome of the trial is </p><p>already helping to galvanize governmental, parliamentary, </p><p>and public support for new judicial tools to target </p><p>terrorism.  Embassy is consulting with the Dutch on "best </p><p>practices" - e.g., means of establishing a mechanism for the </p><p>use of intelligence information in court; strengthening </p><p>action on terrorist financing; expanding the nascent use of </p><p>undercover infiltrants in terrorism cases. In the wake of </p><p>this ruling, Amb. Sobel has scheduled meetings with Justice </p><p>Minister Donner and Chief Attorney General De Wijkerlslooth </p><p>to accelerate existing bilateral cooperation aimed at </p><p>strengthening Dutch counterterrorism laws.   We will look to </p><p>Washington agencies for support and expertise.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
