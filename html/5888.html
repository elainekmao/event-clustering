<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GOK TO PUSH INCLUSION OF 1441 LANGUAGE IN NAM </p><p>STATEMENT; IRAQI PLEAS TO ARAB MEMBERS FALL UPON DEAF EARS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 47493 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On February 21, the Ambassador delivered </p><p>reftel points to Kuwaiti Minister for Amiri Diwan Affairs </p><p>Shaykh Nasser Mohammed, who assured him that the GOK fully </p><p>understands the need to support UNSCR 1441 during the </p><p>Non-Aligned Movement\'s (NAM) session in Kuala Lumpur.  Shaykh </p><p>Nasser said he had spoken with First Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad </p><p>al-Sabah, who had instructed the GOK delegation to push for </p><p>the inclusion of 1441-specific language in the expected NAM </p><p>statement on Iraq.  In addition, Shaykh Nasser claimed Iraqi </p><p>delegate Hasan al-Musawi had approached Arab NAM </p><p>member-states seeking support, but had been largely rebuffed. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOK to push 1441 language </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On February 21, the Ambassador reviewed the texts of </p><p>two draft statements provided him by Minister of Amiri Diwan </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Nasser Mohammed and now circulating in Kuala </p><p>Lumpur (both have been faxed to the desk).  Finding both </p><p>texts lacking any specific references to UNSCR 1441 or Iraq\'s </p><p>obligation to disarm, the Ambassador called Shaykh Nasser </p><p>and expressed his concern that any NAM statement include </p><p>language condemning Iraq\'s non-compliance with UNSCR 1441 and </p><p>reaffirming Iraq\'s obligation to disarm (reftel).  After </p><p>speaking with First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Shaykh Nasser </p><p>called the Ambassador back to inform him that FM Sabah </p><p>concurs, and had instructed the GOK delegation in Kuala </p><p>Lumpur -- now led by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah, who is well-versed on these </p><p>issues -- to advocate for the inclusion of language calling </p><p>upon the Iraqi regime to fully comply with resolution 1441. </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi envoy surrounded by "spies" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During previous discussions on February 21, Shaykh </p><p>Nasser told the Ambassador that Iraqi PermRep al-Musawi had </p><p>approached delegates of Arab NAM member-states in a desperate </p><p>effort to gain their support for Iraq.  Calling the rest of </p><p>the Iraqi delegation Saddam\'s "spies," Musawi told the </p><p>delegates he was just doing his job and he feared for his </p><p>safety should he return to Iraq without a NAM statement </p><p>condemning the possible use of force in Iraq.  According to </p><p>Kuwaiti reports, Shaykh Nasser said, Syria, Sudan, Jordan and </p><p>Lebanon had all told Musawi not to count on their support. </p><p>In addition, the UAE delegate explained that his government </p><p>would be acting in a unified position with other GCC states, </p><p>not unilaterally.  Of the countries Musawi approached, Nasser </p><p>said, only Yemen had indicated it might be willing to support </p><p>Iraq.  The Minister suggested to the Ambassador that the U.S. </p><p>might have more weight with Yemen than Kuwait. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
