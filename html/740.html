<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 002625 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. DECL.: 05/29/2000 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SU, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  A CONVERSATION WITH BASHIR </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PRESIDENT BASHIR AND I MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS AT HIS </p><p>HOME SUNDAY NIGHT, MAY 28.  THE ONLY OTHER PERSON </p><p>PRESENT WAS GENERAL FATIH IRWAH, WHOM BASHIR WANTS TO BE </p><p>HIS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON.  WHEN I NOTED THAT, EXCEPT </p><p>FOR BRIEF ENCOUNTERS AT RECEPTIONS, IT HAD BEEN A YEAR </p><p>AND A HALF SINCE OUR LAST MEETING, BASHIR REPLIED THAT </p><p>DURING THAT TIME HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY REQUEST FROM ME </p><p>FOR A MEETING.  I SAID I HAD TRIED AT LEAST TWICE TO GET </p><p>AN APPOINTMENT.  HE DID NOT RESPOND WHEN I SAID THAT </p><p>PERHAPS SOMEONE HAD NOT FORWARDED MY REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BASHIR SAID, WITH REGARD TO BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE U.S., "IT IS WE WHO FEEL BITTERNESS."  WHEN HIS </p><p>REGIME CAME TO POWER BY OVERTHROWING A DEMOCRATICALLY </p><p>ELECTED GOVERNMENT, "WE UNDERSTOOD 513" AND WHY IT </p><p>REQUIRED A CESSATION OF ECONOMIC AID TO SUDAN. </p><p>INDICATIVE OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT\'S DESIRE FOR GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON, THEY GAVE A CABINET JOB TO </p><p>GENERAL HADI MAMOUN (FYI:  THE LATE MAJ. GEM. MOHAMMED </p><p>AL-HADI MAMOUN AL-MARDI.  END FYI.), WHO THEY KNEW HAD A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CIA.  HE BECAME A MINISTER "EVEN </p><p>THOUGH SOME COMPLAINED."  WITH BASHIR\'S APPROVAL, </p><p>GENERAL MAMOUN MAINTAINED HIS TIES WITH THE STATION </p><p>CHIEF, AT ONE POINT FLYING TO EUROPE TO MEET WITH HIM </p><p>THERE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BUT, BASHIR SAID, "THE U.S. ATTITUDE CONTINUALLY </p><p>ACCELERATED AGAINST US."  HE HAD THOUGHT THAT MY ARRIVAL </p><p>MIGHT MEAN A "NEW BEGINNING TO RECONSTRUCT RELATIONS." </p><p>BUT INSTEAD THEY WORSENED.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE GOS HAD </p><p>TRIED TO GIVE US FACTS ABOUT "THE JUBA INCIDENT" (I.E., </p><p>IN 1992 WHEN USAID FSNS WERE EXECUTED, BUT WASHINGTON </p><p>ONLY BECAME MORE NEGATIVE.  HE CITED "THE U.S. CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST US" AND STATED THAT IT STEMMED FROM "A HOSTILE </p><p>ATTITUDE RATHER THAN A FACTUAL BASIS."  HE THEN MADE THE </p><p>FAMILIAR COMPLAINT THAT THE U.S. HAS SINGLED OUT SUDAN </p><p>FOR CENSURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE SOFT-PEDALING </p><p>COMPLAINTS ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE EGYPT, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND "YOUR FRIEND MUSEVENI." </p><p> </p><p>5.  TURNING TO THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, BASHIR SAID HE HAD </p><p>INHERITED IT FROM NIMEIRY AND SADIQ.  THE GOS HAD MADE </p><p>CONCESSIONS THAT NO OTHER GOVERNMENT HAD MADE; IT HAS </p><p>IMPLEMENTING A TRULY FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>WAS NOT APPLYING SHARIA IN THE SOUTH.  DESPITE THE </p><p>"NEGATIVE MILITARY CONSEQUENCES" THE GOS GAVE APPROVAL </p><p>TO OLS OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH.  HE GRUMBLED THAT EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE SUDANESE ARMY HAS MADE GAINS AND CONTROLS </p><p>NINETY PERCENT OF THE TERRITORY IN THE SOUTH, THE OLS </p><p>CONTINUES TO SEND NINETY PERCENT OF RELIEF SUPPLIES TO </p><p>SPLA-HELD TERRITORY.  THE OLS, HE CHARGED, IS FEEDING </p><p>THE SPLA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SUMMING UP, BASHIR SAID, "WHATEVER WE DO, THE </p><p>OUTCOME IS MORE PRESSURE AND HOSTILITY" FROM </p><p>WASHINGTON.  HE PROTESTED THAT "WE IN PRINCIPLE DO NOT </p><p>HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THE U.S.  WE WANT GOOD RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE U.S." </p><p> </p><p>7.  I INITIATED MY RESPONSE BY FIRST STRESSING THAT </p><p>CONTRARY TO WHAT HIS GOVERNMENT AND TURABI SAY, THE USG </p><p>IS NOT ANTI-ISLAMIC, AND I SPELLED OUT WHY MY ASSERTION </p><p>HAS TRUE.  AS FOR WHY WE HAVE FOCUSED SO MUCH NEGATIVE </p><p>ATTENTION ON SUDAN, I WENT THOUGH THE CUMULATIVE FACTORS </p><p>THAT ACCOUNT FOR THIS, NOTING THAT I HAD EXPLAINED THIS </p><p>TO HIM AND OTHERS HERE MANY TIMES.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, I </p><p>SAID IT DID SUDAN NO GOOD TO COMPARE ITS RECORD WITH </p><p>OTHERS\'.  SUDAN HAD TO OWN UP TO ITS PROBLEMS AND BEGIN </p><p>TO ADDRESS THEM.  THE ARREST OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI AND SOME </p><p>OF HIS FOLLOWERS SOLELY BECAUSE OF SADIQ\'S RECENT PUBLIC </p><p>CRITICISMS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND TURABI\'S POPULAR </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE HAS A CASE IN POINT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  I TOLD BASHIR AND FATIH THAT SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER </p><p>IS A CAREFUL LAWYER WHO WOULD NOT TAKE A FAR-REACHING </p><p>DECISION TO PLACE SUDAN ON THE LIST OF STATE SPONSORS OF </p><p>TERRORISM UNLESS HE HAD A SOLID, FACTUAL BASIS FOR HIS </p><p>ECISION.  I SAID IT HAS A FACT THAT THE PIJ, MAMAS, ABU </p><p>NIDAL ORGANIZATION, HIZBALLAH, GAMAA ISLAMIA AND OTHER </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OFFICES IN KHARTOUM AND </p><p>INTERACT WITH ELEMENTS OF BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT.  IN </p><p>RECENT MONTHS TWO SHIPMENTS OF ARMS FROM THE IRANIANS TO </p><p>THE FIS HAD PASSED THROUGH SUDAN.  THE IRANIANS HERE </p><p>HAVE DEALINGS WITH TERRORISTS, I ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  I DEFENDED THE OLS OPERATIONS, STATING THAT THE UN </p><p>IS NEUTRAL AND ENDEAVORING ONLY TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERING </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE WAR.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>FOOD HAS MADE SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF ON-THE-SPOT </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT GOES TO SPLA-HELD </p><p>TERRITORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE HUGE NUMBER OF </p><p>DISPLACED SOUTHERNERS THERE, TENS OF THOUSANDS AT LABONE </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, AS OPPOSED TO RELATIVELY FEW CIVILIANS IN </p><p>THE TOWNS HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  BASHIR DEFENDED THE DETENTION OF SADIQ.  ASKING </p><p>RHETORICALLY WHETHER I HAD HEARD OF BRIGADIER ABDULAZIZ </p><p>KHALID AND HIS "ALLIANCE FORCES," HE SAID SADIQ AND </p><p>OTHERS IN THE UMMA LEADERSHIP HAD SIGNED THE </p><p>PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE </p><p>REGIME.  AND IN HIS SERMON AT THE ANSAR MOSQUE TWO WEEKS </p><p>AGO, SADIQ HAD ENDORSED THE SPILLING OF BLOOD.  I </p><p>REPLIED THAT IF SADIQ HAD COMMITTED A CRIME UNDER </p><p>SUDANESE LAW, HE SHOULD BE CHARGED AND TRIED IN A COURT </p><p>OF LAW.  FATIH SAID THAT SADIQ IS BEING HANDLED IN </p><p>CONFORMACE WITH THE LAW, WHICH ALLOWS PERSONS TO BE HELD </p><p>WITHOUT CHARGE WHILE EVIDENCE IS BEING GATHERED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  BASHIR DENIED THAT ANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS I </p><p>MENTIONED, EXCEPT FOR HAMAS, HAVE OFFICES HERE.  HE SAID </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAD REQUESTED THIS PRIVILEGE </p><p>BUT HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN.  THE GOS ALSO HAD DENIED A </p><p>SIMILAR REQUEST BY THE ARMED JIBRIL ORGANIZATION. </p><p>HIZBALLAH HAS OFFICES AND PEOPLE IN OTHER CITIES AND </p><p>DOES NOT NEED ONE HERE.  THE GOS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH </p><p>GAMIAT ISLAMIYA.  SUDAN DOES NOT CONSIDER MAMAS TO BE A </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  IT HAS COMMITTED NO ACTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE OUTSIDE THE "OCCUPIED TERRITORIES," HE </p><p>ASSERTED.  LATER, I MENTIONED SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS </p><p>THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE TERRORIST PRESENCE IN KHARTOUM </p><p>(SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>12.  BASHIR BROUGHT UP HIS APPOINTMENT OF FATIH TO BE </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.  HE SAID "THIS APPOINTMENT IS MY </p><p>APPOINTMENT," NOT THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S OR ANYONE </p><p>ELSE\'S.  FATIH WOULD "CARRY MY PERSONAL VIEW, </p><p>ACCURATELY, IN MY NAME" AND WOULD "REPORT BACK HONESTLY </p><p>AND ACCURATELY."  HE SAID THIS PROVED THAT HE WANTS "A </p><p>DIRECT LINK TO WASHINGTON," NOT ONE HAMPERED BY A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. </p><p>(ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS TOPIC BY SEPTEL IN AGREMENT </p><p>CHANNEL.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE PEACE PROCESS.  I WILL REPORT </p><p>ON THIS ASPECT IN A SEPTEL THAT WILL HAVE WIDER </p><p>DISTRIBUTION THAN THIS CABLE\'S. </p><p> </p><p>14.  COMMENT:  EXCEPT FOR BRIEF MOMENTS, THE </p><p>MEETING WAS VERY AMICABLE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT BASHIR </p><p>REALLY DOES WANT BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., BUT WE </p><p>SIMPLY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET THROUGH TO HIM THAT OUR </p><p>QUARRELS WITH HIS REGIME ARE BASED ON VALID CONCERNS. </p><p>HE SAYS HE KNOWS THAT I AM BEING HONEST WITH HIM AND </p><p>SEEMS TO APPRECIATE THAT.  NEVERTHELESS HE EITHER IS </p><p>POORLY INFORMED ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THE OFFICES THAT </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DO INDEED HAVE HERE, OR HE IS </p><p>BEING DISINGENUOUS.  WE AGREED THAT WE NEED TO TRY A NEW </p><p>TACK IN TRYING TO OVERCOME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE </p><p>U.S. AND SUDAN AND THAT WE WILL DISCUSS THIS AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETTERSON </p><p></p></div>
