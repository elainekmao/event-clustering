<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY: ECOFIN DEBATE OVER THE </p><p>STABILITY PACT CATCHES GOI BY SURPRISE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. USEU BRUSSELS 3255 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 1117 </p><p></p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KAREN MILLIKEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC\'S CALL FOR A SOFTENING OF </p><p>THE EU STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT IN A TELEVISED BASTILLE DAY </p><p>INTERVIEW THE SAME EVENING AS THE JULY 14 MEETING OF EUROZONE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTERS IN BRUSSELS (USEU SEPTEL) TOOK GOI </p><p>OFFICIALS BY SURPRISE, CARLO MONTICELLI (PLEASE PROTECT), </p><p>SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR G7 AND EU AFFAIRS AT THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY, TOLD US ON JULY 17TH.  MINISTERS ALSO WERE </p><p>UNPREPARED BY THE STRONG REITERATION OF CHIRAC\'S CALL BY </p><p>FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER FRANCIS MER.  THEY WERE EQUALLY TAKEN </p><p>ABACK BY THE MOVE BY AUSTRIA\'S KARL-HEINZ GRASSER AFTER THE </p><p>MEETING TO BREAK THE EUROGROUP "CODE OF SILENCE" AND TALK TO </p><p>THE PRESS ABOUT MER\'S INTERVENTION.  GOING PUBIC ABOUT WHAT </p><p>TRANSPIRED IN THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS OF THIS INFORMAL </p><p>GROUP IS UNPRECEDENTED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) GOI OFFICIALS, REMARKED MONTICELLI, BELIEVE EUROPE\'S </p><p>INTERESTS WERE ILL-SERVED BY WHAT BECAME A PUBLIC SPAT AFTER </p><p>FRANCE CRITICIZED AUSTRIA AND MINISTERS FROM SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>SMALL COUNTRIES TOOK GRASSER\'S OPENING AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>PILE ON.  HOWEVER, THE GOI DID NOT WANT TO EXACERBATE </p><p>TENSIONS BY ISSUING A PUBLIC REPRIMAND TO AUSTRIA.  IN AN </p><p>ASIDE, MONTICELLI SAID THAT THERE WAS SOME CONSTERNATION </p><p>AMONG ITALIAN OFFICIALS FOR BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN </p><p>THE PROCEEDINGS.  HE ALSO WRYLY NOTED THAT THE FIRST THREE </p><p>WEEKS OF ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY HAVE BEEN MARKED BY </p><p>ATTENTION-GRABBING HEADLINES, AND NOT JUST BY THE ITALIANS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) REGARDING THE STABILITY PACT ITSELF, MONTICELLI SAID </p><p>    THAT FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI, AS HE INDICATED IN BRUSSELS, </p><p>CONTINUES TO STEADFASTLY SUPPORT THE PACT\'S REQUIREMENTS. </p><p>ITALIAN FINANCE OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT FRANCE WILL EVENTUALLY </p><p>COME BACK INTO THE "FOLD", AND TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL BRING </p><p>FRANCE CLOSER TO, OR AT LEAST BE LESS IN BREACH OF, PACT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS.  THE PEER PRESSURE FROM THE OTHER MINISTERS ON </p><p>FRANCE IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO SIGNIFICANT, HE ARGUED. </p><p>FRENCH OFFICIALS, HE CONTINUED, THEMSELVES SAID AT THE LAST </p><p>ECOFIN THAT FRANCE WOULD STRIVE TO MEET THE THREE PERCENT </p><p>DEFICIT TARGET IN 2004 (REFTEL). MONTICELLI ALSO COMMENTED </p><p>THAT NOT ONLY SMALL COUNTRIES ARE BECOMING IMPATIENT WITH </p><p>FRANCE AND GERMANY.  ALTHOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE </p><p>STABILITY PACT IS A TIGHT STRAIGHT-JACKET, SOME GOVERNMENTS </p><p>ARE NOT SYMPATHETIC TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WHICH CHOOSE NOT </p><p>TO PUT THEIR FISCAL ACCOUNTS IN ORDER IN BOOM YEARS AND ARE </p><p>NOW ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL BREATHING SPACE, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THAT SAID, MONTICELLI NOTED, THERE DOES SEEM TO BE </p><p>SUBTLE SHIFTS IN THE VIEWS OF SOME MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>REGARDING THE STABILITY PACT AND ITS LIMITATIONS ON DEFICIT </p><p>SPENDING. MANY POLITICAL LEADERS ARE LOOKING AT THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHOSE BUDGET DEFICIT IS </p><p>EXCEEDING FOUR PERCENT OF GDP BUT ALSO WHOSE GDP GROWTH RATE </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO BE AT LEAST ONE PERCENT HIGHER THAN EUROPE IN </p><p>2004. UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL NOT KNOW WHICH STRATEGY - THE </p><p>U.S. OR THE EUROGROUP\'S - IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR AT LEAST FIVE </p><p>YEARS, HE REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI NEEDS TO TOE A FINE </p><p>LINE IN BOTH PUBLIC AND BACK-DOOR DISCUSSIONS ON THE </p><p>STABILITY PACT.  TREMONTI HIMSELF HAS BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT </p><p>    THE PACT AND TOLD US, AS RECENTLY AS MARCH, THAT HE WAS </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE STABILITY PACT DID NOT PROMOTE SUFFICIENT </p><p>GROWTH (REFTEL B).  THE CALL BY SOME ITALIAN OFFICIALS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE DEFENSE AND EDUCATION MINISTERS, FOR AN EASING </p><p>OF PACT REQUIREMENTS ALSO HAS PRESSURED TREMONTI TO ALLOW FOR </p><p>DEBATE ON THE PACT ITSELF IN THE EUROGROUP.  NONETHLESS, </p><p>DURING ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY, TREMONTI WILL CONTINUE TO FEEL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE PACT.  A WEAKENED OR COLLAPSE OF </p><p>THE STABILITY PACT IS NOT THE LEGACY THE GOI WANTS FOR ITS </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THIS MESSAGE WAS COORDINATED WITH USEU. </p><p>KILNER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03313 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
