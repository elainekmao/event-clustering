<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001093 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: HARARE MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS: PLATFORMS FOR POLITICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Laboff attended the Harare May Day rally of the </p><p>Zimbabwe Conference of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the umbrella </p><p>labor organization which is under attack by the GOZ.  While </p><p>the May Day celebration has traditionally been the forum for </p><p>the ZCTU to address its worker constituency, this year also </p><p>saw a direct challenge in the form of a competing rally by </p><p>the government-sponsored competing organization -- the </p><p>Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU).  The ZFTU has </p><p>been deliberately muscling in on the activities of the ZCTU, </p><p>going so far as to force union members to sign forms which </p><p>re-direct their membership and payment of dues from the ZCTU </p><p>to the ZFTU.  This year, the ZFTU deliberately pre-empted -- </p><p>apparently with GOZ support -- the ZCTU\'s May Day activities </p><p>by pre-booking the majority of venues where the ZCTU\'s </p><p>celebrations have traditionally been held.  In Harare, for </p><p>instance, the ZCTU\'s event took place at the smaller Gwanzura </p><p>stadium because of a ZFTU rally, accompanied by a soccer </p><p>match, at Rufaro Stadium. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The ZCTU\'s event included a parade of about 15 member </p><p>unions and speeches by leaders of student unions, teachers\' </p><p>unions, and the National Constitutional Assembly as well as </p><p>ZCTU leadership.  The rhetoric consistently emphasized </p><p>cooperation between the various civil organizations and </p><p>resistance to the "illegitimate" election of Mugabe. </p><p>Although socialist Member of Parliament Munyaradzi Gwisai (in </p><p>whose district this event was held), resplendent in a black </p><p>beret and Che Guevara t-shirt, called for mass action against </p><p>Zanu-PF, the speeches were more of a call to resistance, </p><p>rather than a call to arms. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Contrary to newspaper reports which optimistically </p><p>claimed ZCTU attendance of 20,000, we estimate the actual </p><p>figure  was more in the range of 5000-7500. There was a </p><p>significant police presence, including riot control forces, </p><p>but the event was peaceful.  At the rival ZFTU rally at </p><p>Rufaro Stadium, attendance was very limited until the start </p><p>of a highly anticipated soccer match, a crowd-draw tactic </p><p>also used by the President at his recent inauguration. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
