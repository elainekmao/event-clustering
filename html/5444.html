<p>UNCLAS BRASILIA 000356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR RSMITH, SCRONIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TIMING OF MERCOSUL FTAA OFFERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 1/21/03 FAIR-MALITO/SMITH EMAIL B) 1/24/03 </p><p> </p><p>     FAIR-SMITH/MALITO EMAIL </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Brazilian dailies Gazeta Mercantil and O Estado </p><p>reported today on the progress of market access discussions </p><p>this week between Mercosul FTAA negotiating teams meeting in </p><p>Asuncion.  The dailies note that a consensus position </p><p>regarding all of the FTAA market access offers has not been </p><p>achieved.  O Estado reported that Brazil had been unable to </p><p>convince its Mercosul partners to delay submission of offers </p><p>for services, investment and government procurement beyond </p><p>the February 15 deadline, and speculated that this would </p><p>pressure Brazil to accelerate preparation of its offers. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ECONOFF subsequently spoke to Ana Patricia Neves </p><p>Tanaka, an official who follows the FTAA market access </p><p>negotiations within Itamaraty\'s FTAA Coordinating Office </p><p>(COALCA), to clarify the situation; Tovar da Silva Nunes, </p><p>head of COALCA, is still in Asuncion.  Although no final </p><p>decision will be made until Mercosul Ministers meet in </p><p>Montevideo on February 5, it is expected that, as previously </p><p>reported, joint Mercosul offers for industrial and </p><p>agricultural goods will be made by February 15. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Contrary to what was reported in O Estado, Neves </p><p>Tanaka confirmed that Brazil still plans at this time to make </p><p>a separate services offer also by February 15 (ref A); she </p><p>expects that the other Mercosul countries will do likewise. </p><p>Driven by differing legislation and national interests, the </p><p>Mercosul partners have reportedly agreed to proceed with </p><p>individual offers in services, investment and government </p><p>procurement.  According to Neves Tanaka, the main </p><p>disagreement surrounds Brazil\'s interest in delaying its </p><p>market access offers for investment and government </p><p>procurement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Brazil is reportedly facing opposition to its </p><p>proposal to delay investment and government procurement </p><p>offers because Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have theirs </p><p>prepared and want to meet the February 15 deadline.  The </p><p>expectation in Itamaraty has been that Mercosul proposals in </p><p>the areas of services, investments, and government </p><p>procurement would be presented under common preambles, with </p><p>separate market access offers attached. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Neves Tanaka believes it is unlikely that Brazil </p><p>will change its decision to delay investment and government </p><p>procurement offers until after February 15.  This would leave </p><p>its Mercosul partners in the uncomfortable position of having </p><p>to decide if they will all hold back, or present an even less </p><p>than united front by moving forward without Brazil. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Neves Tanaka explained that the first three days of </p><p>the meeting this week were political in nature and that </p><p>discussions yesterday and today are technical.  Technical </p><p>work is focused on developing the joint goods offers.  One </p><p>thorny technical issue being discussed is how to treat </p><p>products for which the Mercosul members have different </p><p>tariffs rates due to the many exceptions that have been taken </p><p>to the group\'s Common External Tariff.  No additional </p><p>information regarding characteristics of the Mercosul goods </p><p>offers is available at this time (ref B). </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
