<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT EDITORS LAUNCH FORUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editors of five privately-owned mainstream newspapers </p><p>      have launched a national editors\' forum "to promote and </p><p>      defend press freedom and free speech" in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>      Zimbabwe National Editor\'s Forum (ZINEF) was launched on </p><p>      June 12 by editors Geoff Nyarota of "The Daily News," </p><p>      Francis Mdlongwa of the weekly "The Financial Gazette," </p><p>      Iden Wetherell of the weekly "Zimbabwe Independent," </p><p>      Bornwell Chakaodza of the "The Sunday Standard," and Chiza </p><p>      Ngwira, editor of the monthly magazine "Parade." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ZINEF\'s self-described mission is to challenge laws </p><p>      that threaten media freedom and freedom of expression, and </p><p>      to encourage the government to ensure transparency, </p><p>      openness and accountability in public administration. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Meanwhile, an article carried in the June 13 edition </p><p>      of the "Financial Gazette," reports that the independent </p><p>      media in Zimbabwe are preparing to take the government to </p><p>      court to challenge sections of the Access to Information </p><p>      and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  The move comes two </p><p>      days before a government deadline for the registration of </p><p>      media organizations.  Under AIPPA, no newspaper, radio or </p><p>      television station, advertising agency or journalist will </p><p>      be allowed to operate after June 16 unless they are </p><p>      registered with or accredited by the Media and Information </p><p>      Commission.  However, the Media Commission has not yet set </p><p>      up registration or accreditation processes, and Chairman </p><p>      Tafataona Mahoso has said that the Commission will not take </p><p>      immediate action against unregistered media organizations </p><p>      or journalists. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
