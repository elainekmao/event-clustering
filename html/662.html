<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 003027 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR ARA/CCA -- DENNIS HAYS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:      OADR:DECL </p><p>TAGS:      PGOV, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:   CASTRO\'S HEALTH RUMORS -- FURTHER RUMINATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTLAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FIDEL CASTRO\'S RECENT TRIPS TO BARBADOS AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, AS WELL AS HIS APPEARANCES DURING THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY AND THE DIALOGUE WITH THE EXILE COMMUNITY, BOTH </p><p>OF WHICH WERE TELEVISED, GIVE THE LIE TO RUMORS THAT HE </p><p>IS SUFFERING FROM SOME GRAVE ILLNESS.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>RUMORS DO PERSIST THAT HE HAD A MILD CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA. </p><p>ACTIVIST VLADIMIRO ROCA TOLD USINT RECENTLY THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THE RUMORS THAT CIRCULATED HERE AROUND </p><p>MID-APRIL WERE NOTHING MORE THAN A DELAYED REACTION TO A </p><p>LEAK IN LATE MARCH- EARLY APRIL THAT CASTRO HAD AN </p><p>ISCHEMIA.  ACCORDING TO ROCA, ISCHEMIAS CAN BE TREATED </p><p>WITH MEDICATION AND BEDREST, WHICH, IN ROCA\'S VIEW, </p><p>WOULD EXPLAIN CASTRO\'S ABSENCE FROM PUBLIC LIFE FOR </p><p>THREE WEEKS DURING THAT TIME FRAME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RMO DWIGHT BABCOCK TOLD US DURING HIS MAY 11 VISIT </p><p>HERE THAT ISCHEMIAS ARE CAUSED BY LACK OF BLOOD FLOW </p><p>(AND THEREFORE LACK OF OXYGEN) TO A PARTICULAR AREA, </p><p>USUALLY THE BRAIN, HEART OR LEGS.  A CEREBRAL ISHEMIA IS </p><p>CAUSED BY AN OBSTRUCTION AT THE CAROTID JUNCTION AND CAN </p><p>LEAD TO MICROINFARCTS, SMALL AREAS OF DEAD OR DYING </p><p>BRAIN TISSUE CAUSED BY THE LACK OF BLOOD FLOW.  IF </p><p>UNTREATED, THIS CAN LEAD TO VARYING DEGREES OF SENILITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TREATMENT CAN BE TO EITHER REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION IN </p><p>A SIMPLE OPERATION AT THE BASE OF THE NECK OR BY USING </p><p>ANTICOAGULANTS.  DR. BABCOCK NOTED THAT 95 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE THE ANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT HAVE </p><p>NO PROBLEM, THOUGH 5 PERCENT DO RUN THE RISK OF HAVING A </p><p>STROKE.  THE OPERATION ALSO IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND </p><p>WOULD REQUIRE ONLY 3-5 DAYS HOSPITALIZATION.  IN BOTH </p><p>CASES, THE PATIENT WOULD BE ADVISED TO REST 10-30 DAYS </p><p>DURING TREATMENT, THOUGH HE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO CARRY </p><p>OUT SIMPLE ACTIVITIES.  AN OPERATION WOULD LEAVE A SMALL </p><p>ONE-AND-HALF INCH SCAR, BUT ONE WHICH COULD EASILY BE </p><p>COVERED BY A HIGH COLLAR OR MAKEUP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BABCOCK NOTED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ISCHEMIA IS </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY TREATED, THERE IS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY </p><p>THAT WITHIN 2-3 YEARS THE PATIENT COULD HAVE ANOTHER </p><p>ISCHEMIA IN THE SAME AREA.  MOREOVER, THE PATIENT IS </p><p>ALSO AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING ISCHEMIAS IN OTHER </p><p>PARTS OF THE BODY (LIKE THE LEG OR HEART).  HOWEVER, </p><p>WITH PROPER TREATMENT (ASPIRIN AND OTHER </p><p>ANTICOAGULANTS), THE PATIENT COULD LIVE SEVERAL MORE </p><p>YEARS -- THE RMO DID NOT WANT TO EVEN HAZARD A GUESS AT </p><p>POSSIBLE LIFE EXPECTANCY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A FOOTNOTE:  P/E OFF FINALLY SPOKE WITH ACTIVIST </p><p>AIDA VALDES MAY 10 REGARDING HER SOURCE WHO TOLD HER ON </p><p>APRIL 19 THAT CASTRO WAS SERIOUSLY ILL AND BEING TREATED </p><p>IN AN INTENSIVE CARE ROOM SET UP AT THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE.  SHE SAID THAT HER SOURCE, CRISTOBAL FAJARDO, </p><p>HAD BEEN RELIABLE IN THE PAST, BUT SHE HAS BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THE RUMOR BECAUSE HE WAS ARRESTED </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER THE RUMORS STARTED CIRCULATING.  VALDES </p><p>SAID THAT FAJARDO HAS BEEN HELD VIRTUALLY INCOMMUNICADO </p><p>AT VILLA MARISTAS FOR THREE WEEKS.  (SHE SAID THAT </p><p>FAJARDO WORKS WITH THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAVE </p><p>NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY LISTING FOR HIM IN OUR </p><p>RECORDS.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT CASTRO SUFFERED </p><p>SOME MILD ISCHEMIA IN LATE MARCH.  RUMORS ABOUT THE </p><p>ISCHEMIA MESH WITH ANOTHER RUMOR USINT PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>HAD HEARD FROM A EUROPEAN AMBASSADOR THAT CASTRO HAD HAD </p><p>A SMALL OPERATION AT THE BASE OF THE NECK, QUITE </p><p>PROBABLY TO REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION.  ANOTHER PART OF </p><p>THIS RUMOR (HAVANA 2693) WAS THAT CASTRO\'S SENSE OF </p><p>BALANCE HAD BEEN AFFECTED, A COMMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE </p><p>SLOW, CAREFUL STEPS BY CASTRO AT THE APRIL 25 AIRPORT </p><p>ARRIVAL CEREMONY FOR THE VISITING ZAMBIAN PRESI </p><p>DENT. </p><p> </p><p>CASTRO DID LOOK TIRED DURING HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES HERE </p><p>IN MID- AND LATE APRIL, THOUGH HE SEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>REBOUNDED WELL FOR HIS EXHAUSTING TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF THE RIGORS OF HIS TRAVELS </p><p>AFFECT HIM AFTER HIS RETURN TO CUBA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
