<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001040 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WRAP-UP: MARCH 12-18, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 00896 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 00986 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The long-running Kheiran Pearls scandal was finally </p><p>resolved this week (reftel B) when a vote of no-confidence </p><p>against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for </p><p>Cabinet Affairs Mohammed Sharar failed to pass the National </p><p>Assembly.  Motions to cancel the Kheiran Pearls contract and </p><p>to refer former Minister of Finance Yousef Al-Ibrahim to the </p><p>Minister\'s Court were also defeated.  These developments </p><p>represent a much-needed victory for the goverment in the </p><p>run-up to the July 2003 parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The government sought National Assembly approval to </p><p>reallocate KD 500 million (approximately $1.6 billion) from </p><p>the state\'s general reserve to meet unexpected expenses </p><p>related to the current Iraq crisis (reftel A).  The National </p><p>Assembly Budget Committee expressed reservations about the </p><p>motion, calling the government\'s request too vague.  Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Sharar agreed to present more details of the </p><p>proposed expenditures to the Committee and asked the National </p><p>Assembly to be prepared to discuss the motion at the next </p><p>session in two weeks.  After a special closed-door session on </p><p>March 18, First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister </p><p>Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah reportedly asked the National </p><p>Assembly to approve the supplementary budget and expressed </p><p>his hope the measure might be ratified by the end of the </p><p>week, but press reports indicate easy passage of the measure </p><p>is unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In the special closed-door session, the government </p><p>reportedly outlined measures taken to protect Kuwait in the </p><p>event of a U.S. led war in Iraq.  Shaykh Sabah announced to </p><p>the National Assembly the increase of security at vital </p><p>installations, the intensification of security patrols </p><p>thoughout the city, the monitoring of air to allow for early </p><p>detection of WMD pollutants, and the constant examination of </p><p>purification centers to prevent contaminaton of the water </p><p>supply.  Shaykh Sabah thanked the international community and </p><p>the GCC for sending troops to protect Kuwait, and condemned </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s refusal to take steps to prevent another war </p><p>in the region. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Quotes of the week: Scientific Salafi MP Walid </p><p>Al-Tabtabaei called a GOK decision to bar Israeli journalists </p><p>from Kuwait "wise, brave, and patriotic".  Minister of State </p><p>for Foreign Affairs Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah declared the UAE </p><p>initiative calling for Saddam to step down "the last chance </p><p>for a peaceful solution and the last glimpse of hope." </p><p>Speaker of the National Assembly Jassem Al-Kharafi </p><p>underscored Kuwait\'s gratitude for America\'s role in the </p><p>liberation, but added "this does not prohibit us from saying </p><p>to America our point of view in the event of starting to </p><p>believe that it will be the world policeman." </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
