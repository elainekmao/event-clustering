TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04695  01 OF 02  241456Z </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLICE HAVE EVICTED WAR VETERANS FROM A NUMBER </p><p>OF FARMS THIS WEEK, PROMPTING TWO DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE </p><p>VETERANS THROUGH DOWNTOWN HARARE.  EVICTIONS WERE </p><p>CONTINUING ON AUGUST 24, DESPITE AN UNCONFIRMED PRESS </p><p>REPORT THAT THE CABINET HAD CALLED A HALT TO THE POLICE </p><p>ACTIONS.  THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION WAS ENCOURAGED BY </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENTS, BUT RESERVED JUDGMENT ON WHETHER THEY </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE.  THE CFU WITHDREW ITS COURT ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A </p><p>CHANNEL OF DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ, AND IS NOW TRYING TO </p><p>FIND FINANCING TO ENABLE FARMERS TO PROCEED WITH THE </p><p>PLANTING SEASON, BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1.  WHETHER THE </p><p>EVICTIONS CONTINUE WILL INDICATE WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS SERIOUS ABOUT ENDING THE OCCUPATIONS AND RESTORING </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AFTER POLICE EVICTED HUNDREDS OF WAR VETERANS </p><p>FROM FOUR FARMS NEAR HARARE ON AUGUST 22, WAR VETERANS </p><p>TOOK TO THE STREETS IN THE CAPITAL ON AUGUST 23 AND 24 </p><p>TO PROTEST THE POLICE ACTION.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>EVICTIONS REPORTED IN REFTEL, POLICE ON AUGUST 22 MOVED </p><p>HUNDREDS OF ENCAMPED WAR VETERANS OFF OF FOUR FARMS IN </p><p>KAMBUZUMA TOWNSHIP ON HARARE\'S OUTSKIRTS AND TORE DOWN </p><p>THEIR NEARLY COMPLETED CINDERBLOCK HOMES.  OTHER WOODEN </p><p>STRUCTURES WERE BURNED.  STATE-RUN MEDIA WIDELY </p><p>PUBLICIZED THE ACTION, WHICH THEY SAID HAD BEEN ORDERED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04695  01 OF 02  241456Z </p><p>BY HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO.  ON AUGUST 23, </p><p>ABOUT 200 WAR VETERANS PROTESTED IN FRONT OF NKOMO\'S </p><p>OFFICE, DENOUNCING HIS ACTION WITH PLACARDS AND CHANTS. </p><p>THE PROTESTERS PROCEEDED TO PARLIAMENT AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE BEFORE DISPERSING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON AUGUST 24, THE NORMALLY VITRIOLIC INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO ISSUED A RELATIVELY MILD </p><p>STATEMENT OF "REGRET" FOR MONDAY\'S POLICE ACTION, </p><p>CRITICIZING THE POLICE METHODS BUT NOT THE EVICTIONS </p><p>THEMSELVES.  MOYO FURTHER STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WOULD SEEK TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION FOR THE SQUATTERS </p><p>WHOSE MAKESHIFT HOMES WERE DESTROYED.  SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>WAR VETERANS TOOK TO HARARE\'S STREETS AGAIN ON AUGUST </p><p>24, MOVING DOWN SAMORA MICHEL AVENUE IN FRONT OF THE </p><p>BUILDING HOUSING THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE AND THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY.  POLOFFS WERE IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME AND </p><p>COULD CLEARLY HEAR THE VETERANS\' SONGS AND CHANTS, </p><p>SUGGESTING ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE HEARING </p><p>THEM AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE INDEPENDENT "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" REPORTED </p><p>THAT AFTER A CABINET MEETING AUGUST 23, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DECIDED TO END FURTHER POLICE ACTIONS AGAINST SQUATTERS. </p><p>THE GAZETTE SUGGESTED THAT THE MEETING WAS HELD AFTER </p><p>WAR VETERANS COMPLAINED TO MUGABE DIRECTLY UPON HIS </p><p>AUGUST 22 RETURN FROM MAPUTO AND THAT A NUMBER OF </p><p>UNNAMED CABINET MEMBERS WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE POLICE\'S </p><p>HEAVY-HANDED APPROACH.  WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM </p><p>THE GAZETTE\'S REPORT OF THE CABINET DECISION, AND IN </p><p>FACT WERE INFORMED BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04695  01 OF 02  241456Z </p><p>THAT SQUATTER EVICTIONS ARE UNDERWAY ON AUGUST 24 ON </p><p>FARMS IN MASHONALAND EAST AND MASHONALAND WEST </p><p>PROVINCES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  CFU DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK TOLD POLOFF ON AUGUST 23 </p><p>HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS, BUT </p><p>RESERVED JUDGMENT ON WHETHER THE EVICTIONS WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE.  HE SAID THE GOZ HAD INFORMED THE CFU EARLIER </p><p>IN THE WEEK THAT ALL WAR VETERANS WOULD BE REMOVED FROM </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS WITHIN 10 DAYS, SCREENED, AND ASSIGNED TO </p><p>FARMS IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION.  NOTING </p><p>THAT EARLY SEPTEMBER IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR TOBACCO </p><p>PLANTING, HASLUCK SAID THE CFU IS TRYING TO CONVINCE </p><p>FARMERS NOT ON THE LIST OF 1,033 ALREADY IDENTIFIED TO </p><p>PROCEED WITH PLANTING, AND IS WORKING FRANTICALLY TO </p><p>SECURE FINANCING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.  HASLUCK </p><p>INFORMED POLOFF THAT THE CFU HAD WITHDRAWN ITS COURT </p><p>ACTION AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE, POLICE COMMISSIONER </p><p>CHIHURI, AND WAR VETERANS LEADER HUNZVI IN THE HOPE THAT </p><p>THIS WOULD ENSURE CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS </p><p>INDICATE THAT THE GOZ IS STILL TRYING TO COME TO GRIPS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2714 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04695  02 OF 02  241456Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------7D97B2  241457Z /38 </p><p>O 241454Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6926 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/16/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT:  WAR VETERANS REACT TO LAND EVICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>WITH ENDING THE FARM OCCUPATIONS IN A WAY THAT IS </p><p>PALATABLE TO THOSE SYMPATHETIC TO THE WAR VETERANS.  IT </p><p>IS STILL VERY UNCLEAR WHETHER THE GOZ WILL BE SUCCESSFUL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04695  02 OF 02  241456Z </p><p>IN THIS EFFORT.  THE POLICE ACTIONS AND THEIR WIDESPREAD </p><p>COVERAGE IN THE STATE-RUN MEDIA HAVE CROSSED THE LINE </p><p>WITH SOME IN GOVERNMENT.  MOYO\'S MILD STATEMENT AND </p><p>OFFER FOR COMPENSATION, AND THE CONTINUING EVICTIONS IN </p><p>SOME RURAL AREAS COULD BE A SIGN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>NOT ABANDONED THE IDEA OF ENDING THE OCCUPATIONS </p><p>ALTOGETHER.  WHETHER THE EVICTIONS CONTINUE OR NOT IN </p><p>THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS WILL INDICATE HOW SERIOUS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT ENDING THE FARM OCCUPATIONS AND </p><p>RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
