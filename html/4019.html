<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 003591 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR U/S GROSSMAN S/CT FOR TAYLOR/POPE, NEA FOR CROCKER </p><p>D FOR MCNAMARA </p><p>FBI FOR DIRECTOR MUELLER </p><p>JUSTICE FOR JIM REYNOLDS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/2017 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, PINS, YM, US </p><p>SUBJECT: USS COLE: INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), (C), AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NOFORN) BEGIN SUMMARY:  THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>MOVING TOWARDS KEY DECISIONS REGARDING THE USS COLE </p><p>INVESTIGATION, AND THE SUSPECTS IT HOLDS FALL INTO FOUR </p><p>CATEGORIES: A) THOSE WHO WILL FACE TRIAL SOON; B) THOSE WHOSE </p><p>TRIAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE HELD IN ABEYANCE AT U.S. REQUEST; </p><p>C) THOSE WHO WILL BE RELEASED; AND D) THOSE THE YEMENI </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS UNLIKELY TO PROSECUTE, BUT WHOM WE SHOULD </p><p>PURSUE IN OTHER WAYS.  AMBASSADOR\'S RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: </p><p>PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO YEMEN FOR CATEGORY (A) AND </p><p>PURSUING SEALED INDICTMENTS FOR CATEGORY (D).  SEE FULL </p><p>REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS BELOW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NOFORN) DURING GENERAL FRANKS\'S VISIT OCTOBER 17, </p><p>AMBASSADOR RAISED WITH PRESIDENT SALEH PROSECUTION OF USS </p><p>COLE DEFENDANTS.  NOTING THE RECENT ATTACK ON THE FRENCH </p><p>TANKER, AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF </p><p>TERRORISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USS COLE ATTACK WAS A </p><p>NECESSARY SIGNAL FOR TERRORISTS PLANNING OTHER ATTACKS. </p><p>SALEH INITIALLY COMMENTED THAT THE CASE WAS "SUB JUDICE" AND </p><p>NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.  HE QUICKLY ADDED THAT YEMENI JUSTICE </p><p>WOULD BE TOUGH AND INCLUDE LONG SENTENCES AND EVEN </p><p>EXECUTIONS.  TO FOLLOW UP AMBASSADOR\'S MARKER, EMBASSY </p><p>PROPOSES FOLLOWING THOUGHTS ON THIS CASE. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (S/NOFORN) THE FBI/NCIS TEAM THAT IS WORKING HERE ON THE </p><p>USS COLE INVESTIGATION IS DOING A SUPERB JOB WITH THE </p><p>YEMENIS, AND IN THEIR UPDATES FOR AMBASSADOR IT IS BECOMING </p><p>CLEAR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR WASHINGTON TO </p><p>CONSIDER.  THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS IN THE PROCESS OF DECIDING </p><p>FINALLY WHICH SUSPECTS TO PROSECUTE AND PUT ON TRIAL, WHAT </p><p>KIND OF CASES TO PRESENT, AND WHAT DISPOSITION TO MAKE OF </p><p>REMAINING SUSPECTS.  THE KEY U.S. OBJECTIVE IN THIS IS TO SEE </p><p>THAT THE GUILTY ARE CONVICTED AND PUNISHED, BUT THIS GOAL IS </p><p>LIKELY TO BE SATISFIED ONLY PARTIALLY BY YEMEN\'S DECISIONS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, IT APPEARS THAT BECAUSE OF SHORTCOMINGS IN PSO\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO PREPARE A CASE FOR THE PROSECUTORIAL ARM OF THE </p><p>YEMENI GOVERNMENT, THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>THE U.S. PROSECUTION SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NOFORN). FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, HERE ARE FOUR </p><p>DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF YEMENI-HELD SUSPECTS IN THE COLE </p><p>CASE, AND AMBASSADOR\'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NOFORN) THE FIRST CATEGORY CONTAINS EIGHT AND POSSIBLY </p><p>NINE INDIVIDUALS.  THESE WE UNDERSTAND THE PSO CONSIDERS THAT </p><p>IT HAS EVIDENCE AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE </p><p>INTENTION TO PROSECUTE, CONVICT, AND PUNISH.  THOSE EIGHT </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- MURAD AL-SURURI </p><p>-- ALI AL-MURAKAB </p><p>-- AHMAD AL-SHINI </p><p>-- YASSER AL-IZZANI </p><p>-- YASSER AHMAD QASSIM </p><p>-- ABDULLAH AL-HAKEEM </p><p>-- MUHAMMED DARAMAH </p><p>-- NABIL SALUH </p><p> </p><p>THE NINTH INDIVIDUAL, WAHIB AL-KHODR, THE PSO CONSIDERS IN </p><p>THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE OTHER EIGHT, BUT IS LESS SURE OF ITS </p><p>EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. </p><p> </p><p>FOR THIS GROUP, AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT UNLESS THE USG HAS </p><p>EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, EXONERATING OR MITIGATING THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, THAT WE OFFER TO ASSIST THE YEMENI PROSECUTION </p><p>IN THESE CASES.  OUR FBI/NCIS TEAM HERE ADVISES THAT WHILE </p><p>PSO MAY HAVE EVIDENCE THAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE COMPELLING, </p><p>FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THE CASES MAY NOT BE EQUALLY </p><p>STRONG.  IN PARTICULAR, THEN, LEGAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE U.S. </p><p>ATTORNEY\'S OFFICE IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK COULD </p><p>BE INVALUABLE TO THE YEMENI ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S TEAM AS IT </p><p>SEEKS TO SHAPE THESE PROSECUTIONS, USING WHATEVER EVIDENCE </p><p>MAY ALREADY BE IN THE FILE CASES PROVIDED BY THE PSO AND, </p><p>ALSO, ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE USG MAY BE ABLE TO </p><p>DEVELOP FROM OTHER SOURCES.  SUCH ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED ASAP, AS YEMENI OFFICIALS ARE ON PUBLIC RECORD </p><p>STATING THAT COLE PROSECUTIONS WILL BEGIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p>A STRONG PROSECUTION CASE OBVIOUSLY SERVES BOTH U.S. AND </p><p>YEMENI INTERESTS, AND WE SHOULD ASSIST IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NOFORN) THE SECOND CATEGORY CONTAINS THREE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS.  THESE WERE IDENTIFIED IN FBI DIRECTOR\'S LETTER </p><p>PRESENTED TO PRESIDENT SALEH ON SEPTEMBER 25 - INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WHOM THE U.S. WOULD LIKE TO BE HELD BUT NOT SENT TO TRIAL </p><p>UNTIL THE U.S. COMPLETES INDICTMENTS AGAINST ABD AL-RAHIM </p><p>NASHIRI, TAWFIQ BIN ATTASH, AND AHMAD AMIN.  THESE THREE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- FAHD AL-QUSO\'A </p><p>-- JAMAL AL-BADAWI </p><p>-- AHMAD AHMAD HASAN AMIN (ABU JAFAR AL-TAYYAR) </p><p> </p><p>WE EXPECT THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEDE TO </p><p>THE U.S. REQUEST TO HOLD IN ABEYANCE GOING TO TRIAL FOR THESE </p><p>THREE.  ACCORDINGLY, AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT U.S. </p><p>INDICTMENTS AGAINST NASHIR, ATTASH, AND AMIN BE COMPLETED AS </p><p>SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT FURTHER DELAY IS AVOIDED.  SUCH A </p><p>STEP WILL HELP THE YEMENIS SEE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THE </p><p>COLE INVESTIGATION IN ITS ENTIRETY, AS PART OF OUR </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS AGAINST AL-QAEDA.  INDEFINITE DELAY </p><p>COULD HAVE UNFORESEEABLE COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NOFORN) THE THIRD CATEGORY CONTAINS FOUR INDIVIDUALS. </p><p>THESE FOUR THE YEMENIS HAVE DETERMINED THEY DO NOT HAVE </p><p>SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE, AND ACCORDINGLY WOULD </p><p>RELEASE.  THESE FOUR ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- ABD AL-SALAM AL-FAQIR </p><p>-- ABD AL-HAMID MUTHANA </p><p>-- ABD AL-KARIM AL-RIMI </p><p>-- SA\'EED AL-WAHSH </p><p> </p><p>FBI/NCIS INVESTIGATORS IN SANAA AGREE THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR </p><p>NO EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. </p><p>UNLESS THE U.S. HAS EVIDENCE ELSEWHERE IMPLICATING THESE FOUR </p><p>WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN A YEMENI PROSECUTION OF THEM, </p><p>AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT WE INFORM YEMEN OF NO OBJECTION TO </p><p>THEIR RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NOFORN) THE FOURTH CATEGORY CONTAINS TWO INDIVIDUALS. </p><p>THESE HAVE PRIOR ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE PSO AND THEREFORE WE </p><p>CANNOT EXPECT YEMEN WILL PROSECUTE THEM.  THESE TWO ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- BASHIR AL-SHADADI </p><p>-- AHMAD AMIN (ALSO INCLUDED IN SECOND CATEGORY.) </p><p> </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT U.S. EVIDENCE LEAVES NO DOUBT OF THE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT OF THESE TWO IN THE COLE ATTACK.  ACCORDINGLY, </p><p>AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEK A </p><p>SEALED INDICTMENT FOR THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS, AND IN THE EVENT </p><p>THEY TRAVEL OUTSIDE YEMEN, THE U.S. MAY BE ABLE TO SECURE THE </p><p>COOPERATION OF A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT TO ARREST AND HAND THEM </p><p>OVER TO U.S. AUTHORITIES FOR U.S. PROSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
