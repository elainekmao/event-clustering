<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W </p><p>STATE PASS OPIC, TDA AND EX-IM </p><p>STATE PASS USTR AND DOT </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAIR, ECPS, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP JANUARY 31 </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ABUJA 3345 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) This periodic economic report from Abuja and Lagos </p><p>includes: </p><p>--Dutch Firm Wins BPE Management Contract for NITEL </p><p>--Think Tank Offers Economic Rebuilding Plan </p><p>--Nigeria Airways in Trouble Again </p><p>--Political Conventions Delay 2003 Budget </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dutch Firm Wins BPE Management Contract for NITEL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>2. (U) The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) announced </p><p>January 20 that Pentascope, a Dutch firm, won a three-year </p><p>management contract with Nigeria </p><p>Telecommunications Limited (NITEL). The firm will undertake </p><p>day-to-day operation of NITEL. Fourteen companies submitted </p><p>expressions of interest in June 2002. Five firms--including </p><p>Africa Consortium, a group that included Lucent Technologies </p><p>and BT Teleconsult--were eventually invited to </p><p>submit proposals (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The management contract comes in the wake of a 2002 </p><p>privatization effort that failed after the preferred bidder </p><p>missed two payment deadlines. While another buyer is </p><p>identified, the government plans to offer shares in NITEL to </p><p>the public through the Nigerian Stock Exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Comment: Reviving NITEL, known for its corruption, </p><p>poor service, and crumbling infrastructure, will be no easy </p><p>task. Out of an installed capacity of 700,000 land lines, </p><p>only around 450,000 are operational. Once a monopoly, the </p><p>public telecom now faces stiff competition from private </p><p>telecom operator Globacom, the recent winner of the second </p><p>national carrier license, and Econet and MTN, two </p><p>cellular-only companies. However, teledensity is still very </p><p>low. If Pentascope can turn things around, NITEL can benefit </p><p>from the huge untapped demand for quality and affordable </p><p>communications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Throughout the bidding process, Post has provided </p><p>advocacy assistance to Africa Consortium, a group that </p><p>included Lucent Technologies (reftel). Unlike </p><p>their competition, the Africa Consortium did not invest in </p><p>on-the-ground lobbyists or Nigeria-savvy handlers to guide </p><p>them through the intricate and often less than transparent </p><p>bidding process. Since December 2002, however, the New Jersey </p><p>Commerce and Economic Growth Commission sent two missions to </p><p>Nigeria, led by Nigerian-born International Account Executive </p><p>Isaac Inyang, to lobby the GON on the Consortium\'s and New </p><p>Jersey-based Lucent Technologies\' behalf. During a December </p><p>meeting, Inyang informed Post that if the Consortium lost the </p><p>bid, the State of New Jersey would likely not send trade </p><p>missions to Nigeria for at least five years and instead focus </p><p>on more commercially friendly countries such as Ghana and </p><p>South Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Follow-up conversations with BPE Director General </p><p>Nasir El-Rufai and Africa Consortium Managing Director Chris </p><p>Vaios reveal one reason the Africa Consortium bid lost: the </p><p>GON thought the group, in particular Lucent, lacked </p><p>commitment to the project, in addition to being more </p><p>expensive than its competitors. Nevertheless, Vaios and </p><p>El-Rufai both appear interested in following up with Lucent </p><p>for system design and with Vaios and his contacts for </p><p>financing. BT Teleconsult is, per Vaios, now no longer part </p><p>of the Consortium\'s effort. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Think Tank Offers Economic Rebuilding Plan </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) recently </p><p>held a press luncheon  in Lagos where it proposed structural </p><p>and policy reforms it considers crucial to improve the </p><p>Nigerian economy. The private sector group hopes that </p><p>political candidates, government leaders, and civil society </p><p>will address critical economic issues with sound, long-term </p><p>policy options. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The presentation by NESG chairman Bunmi Oni, CEO of </p><p>Cadbury, Nigeria, focused on the Nigerian economy\'s overall </p><p>stagnant growth rate since oil became the dominant economic </p><p>driver. Oni noted that in 1960, Nigeria\'s per capita GDP was </p><p>comparable to Indonesia\'s at approximately $250. However, in </p><p>the last 40 years, Indonesia\'s per capita GDP has risen to </p><p>nearly $1000, while Nigeria\'s has stagnated at around $300. </p><p>To counter what he called the myth that oil revenue alone can </p><p>sustain the Nigerian economy, Oni stated that at an export </p><p>price of $25 per barrel and a production level of 2 million </p><p>barrels per day, the net annual per capita revenue from oil </p><p>amounts to less than $100. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Oni suggested that Nigerians have become obsessed with </p><p>the notion of resource allocation and revenue sharing, to the </p><p>exclusion of sound and consistent policies for economic </p><p>rebuilding. He also stated that too much emphasis is placed </p><p>on geopolitical zones and called for the establishment of </p><p>economic clusters based on industry sectors with high-growth </p><p>potential and supported by relevant infrastructure </p><p>improvements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The NESG proposes bold steps to curtail government </p><p>spending, including downsizing the government bureaucracy by </p><p>30 percent, selling off prime real estate in Lagos and other </p><p>cities, continued privatization, and a dramatic cut in the </p><p>perks offered to executive and legislative officials. It also </p><p>calls for greater government accountability through quarterly </p><p>State of the Union reports, performance standards for </p><p>Ministers, and economic impact assessments for all major </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The NESG also proposes that 25 percent of the federal </p><p>budget should be spent on education, and 10 percent on health </p><p>care. It advocates an overhaul of the pension system and the </p><p>creation of a social security system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria Airways in Trouble Again </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>12. (U)  Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL), the country\'s </p><p>problem-ridden national airline, temporarily halted flights </p><p>to New York on December 27, leaving hundreds of passengers </p><p>stranded in Lagos. NAL grounded flights after Air Atlantic </p><p>Icelandic (AAI), the company that leases and operates the </p><p>Boeing 747 that flies to New York, refused to fly the route </p><p>until NAL paid a past-due $10 million bill, according to NAL </p><p>Legal Advisor Arobo Kalango. Sources report that the Minister </p><p>of Aviation suspended payments on the AAI lease. Separately, </p><p>Chief I.E. Awodu, Technical Assistant to the Minister of </p><p>Aviation, and Dr. O.B. Aliu, Director of Air Transport </p><p>Regulation, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), said </p><p>the NAL Lagos to New York flight will likely be grounded </p><p>after their airplane leasing contract with Air Atlanta </p><p>Icelandic ends on January 19. Virgin Atlantic Airlines has </p><p>agreed to honor stranded passengers\' tickets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) NAL\'s soon to expire contract with AAI began after </p><p>South African Airways (SAA) pulled out of a joint-venture </p><p>agreement in March 2002, citing lack of profitability. NAL </p><p>officials recently went to South Africa to discuss the </p><p>possibility of renewing cooperation with SAA instead of </p><p>continuing the current AAI lease. Nigeria cannot fly its own </p><p>planes to the United States because Nigeria lacks Category I </p><p>status, the top safety ranking given by the U.S. Federal </p><p>Aviation Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The grounding of NAL flights to New York is only one </p><p>of many problems plaguing the airline. At the end of </p><p>December, four top officials resigned, including the Managing </p><p>Director, who reportedly had fallen out of favor with the </p><p>Minister. In December 2002, the government announced a probe </p><p>into how $400 million disappeared from NAL coffers between </p><p>1983 and 1999, following allegations made against senior </p><p>officials. In September, the Ministry temporarily shelved its </p><p>plans to sell a 49 percent share of the airline to an English </p><p>leasing firm, Airwing Aerospace, after National Assembly </p><p>members and other government officials complained that the </p><p>sale was not transparent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Comment: Nigeria Airways suffers from years of </p><p>mismanagement and corruption that have left large outstanding </p><p>debts. The company owns only two operational aircraft, down </p><p>from about thirty, twenty years ago. The airline\'s future is </p><p>reportedly wrapped up in a political battle between the </p><p>Minister of Aviation and a group of northern businessmen who </p><p>support selling NAL to a South African group through a Bureau </p><p>of Public Enterprise auction. A Ministry of Aviation official </p><p>recently told Emboffs that the Airwing deal would move </p><p>forward. Considering the controversy surrounding the deal, </p><p>NAL\'s problems will most likely be resolved only after the </p><p>April general elections. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Political Conventions Delay 2003 Budget </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>16. (U) Expectations that the House of Representatives would </p><p>pass the 2003 Budget by January 23 suffered a set back last </p><p>week as the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations </p><p>Barau Jibrin announced it would not be possible for the </p><p>committee to work on the budget due to on-going political </p><p>conventions. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
