Summary:  New U.S. investment in Burma has been illegal </p><p>since 1997.  New sanctions imposed in 2003 ban imports of </p><p>Burmese products into the United States and forbid all </p><p>financial transactions between a U.S. person and Burma. </p><p>Burma is a country blessed with extensive natural resources, </p><p>low labor costs, and a great potential for tourism.  It is </p><p>also a member of ASEAN.  However, even if U.S. sanctions were </p><p>removed, an extraordinarily hostile investment climate would </p><p>hold U.S. investment as it has held all other investment to a </p><p>very low level. </p><p> </p><p>Though local investment laws are liberal on the surface, </p><p>their implementation is racked, at all levels, with </p><p>corruption.  The ruling military junta, the State Peace and </p><p>Development Council (SPDC), despite pledging itself to an </p><p>"open door" economic policy and urging foreign firms to </p><p>invest, regularly comes out with punitive and capricious </p><p>regulations, which make investment for foreigners difficult </p><p>if not impossible. </p><p> </p><p>Our view of the current investment climate is very dim.  We </p><p>have not seen any movement toward reform in recent years and </p><p>expect none in the next year.  In fact, if recent events are </p><p>any indication, the situation for investors could well become </p><p>worse before it improves. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. Preface:  U.S. Investment Subject to Sanctions </p><p> </p><p>On May 20, 1997, by Executive Order 13047, the President </p><p>imposed economic sanctions prohibiting new investment by U.S. </p><p>persons or entities in Burma (Myanmar).  Those sanctions were </p><p>based on the President\'s determination that the Government of </p><p>Burma (GOB) has committed large-scale repression of the </p><p>democratic opposition.  The Cohen-Feinstein Amendment to the </p><p>Foreign Operations Act of 1997 formed the legal basis for the </p><p>investment ban.  The U.S. government every six months reviews </p><p>sanctions policy.  Since sanctions were imposed in 1997, the </p><p>State Department has found no measurable progress toward </p><p>political liberalization in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Prior to the imposition of sanctions, a number of </p><p>high-profile U.S. investors had already withdrawn from Burma. </p><p> An active anti-Burma consumer movement in the U.S. caused </p><p>investing in Burma to be high risk in terms of corporate </p><p>image.  The federal investment sanctions ban new investment </p><p>but allow companies already invested in Burma to remain. </p><p> </p><p>The 1997 ban on new investment is in addition to a number of </p><p>sanctions the U.S. imposed against Burma following the </p><p>military crackdown against civilian democracy activists in </p><p>1988 and the failed election of 1990.  The U.S. opposes the </p><p>extension of international financial assistance to Burma, </p><p>prohibits military sales, suspended economic aid and </p><p>commercial assistance programs, banned the issuance of U.S. </p><p>visas to members of the military, political, and economic </p><p>elite, and downgraded our representation in Rangoon from </p><p>Ambassador to Charge.  In addition, the U.S. continues to </p><p>engage in a vigorous diplomatic effort to promote political </p><p>and human rights reforms. </p><p> </p><p>Since the early 1990\'s U.S. commercial policy toward Burma </p><p>had been neither to encourage nor to discourage trade or </p><p>investment.  With the 1997 investment ban, that policy was </p><p>revised to prohibit new investment. </p><p> </p><p>4. Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p> </p><p>With a view to attracting foreign investment, the Burmese </p><p>government instituted the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) on </p><p>November 30, 1988.  The basic priorities of foreign </p><p>investment, according to the FIL, are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>(a) Promotion and expansion of exports; </p><p>(b) Exploitation of natural resources that require heavy </p><p>investment; </p><p>(c) Acquisition of high technology; </p><p>(d) Support for production and services requiring large </p><p>amount of capital; </p><p>(e) Expansion of Employment opportunities; </p><p>(f) Development of facilities that would reduce energy </p><p>consumption; and, </p><p>(g) Regional development. </p><p> </p><p>According to the State-owned Economic Enterprises Law, </p><p>enacted in March 1989, the Government state-owned enterprises </p><p>have the sole right to carry out the following economic </p><p>activities: </p><p> </p><p>(a) Extraction of teak and sale of the same in the country </p><p>and abroad; </p><p>(b) Cultivation and conservation of forest plantations with </p><p>the exception of village-owned firewood plantations </p><p>cultivated by the villagers for their personal use; </p><p>(c) Exploration, extraction, sale, and production of </p><p>petroleum and natural gas; </p><p>(d) Exploration, extraction, and export of pearls, jade and </p><p>precious stones; </p><p>(e) Breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries </p><p>which have been reserved for research by the Government; </p><p>(f) Postal and telecommunications services; </p><p>(g) Air transport and railway transport services; </p><p>(h) Banking and insurance services; </p><p>(i) Broadcasting and television services; </p><p>(j) Exploration, extraction, and exports of metals; </p><p>(k) Electricity generating services other than those </p><p>permitted by law to private and cooperative electricity </p><p>generating services; and, </p><p>(l) Manufacturing of products relating to security and </p><p>defense. </p><p> </p><p>However, the law provides that the Myanmar Investment </p><p>Commission (MIC) may, "in the interest of the State," make </p><p>exceptions.  Exceptions have been made in areas such as banks </p><p>(though not for foreign investors), petroleum and natural gas </p><p>extraction, and air services.  This discretion, though, like </p><p>most else resides in the hands of the cabinet and senior </p><p>generals. </p><p> </p><p>According to the FIL, the MIC must review all investment, </p><p>either foreign or domestic.  However, due to corruption </p><p>within the MIC, the ruling State Peace and Development </p><p>Council (SPDC) removed much of the MIC,s real influence at </p><p>the end of 1999.  Potential investors must still work through </p><p>the MIC, but it has lost the authority to make a decision. </p><p>Interested foreign companies still approach and submit </p><p>proposals through the MIC, which in turn gets approval from </p><p>either the Cabinet (chaired by SPDC Chairman and Prime </p><p>Minister Senior General Than Shwe) or the Trade Policy </p><p>Council (TPC, chaired by SPDC Vice Senior General Maung Aye). </p><p> The Cabinet and the TPC have the same membership so the </p><p>choice of decision-making body is made on a case-by-case </p><p>basis.  Though MIC has no power or authority to protect </p><p>foreign companies, we have no evidence of overt </p><p>discrimination against foreign investors. </p><p>Once the government grants permission to invest, a foreign </p><p>company must get a "Permit to Trade" (essentially a business </p><p>license) from the Ministry of National Planning and Economic </p><p>Development\'s Directorate of Investment and Companies </p><p>Administration (DICA).  In a typical "Catch 22" that has for </p><p>all intents and purposes closed Burma to most new foreign </p><p>investment, since February 2002 the government is no longer </p><p>permitting DICA to issue new permits or renew existing ones </p><p>for foreign firms.  This decision has disrupted the business </p><p>of many foreign investors, and forced closure of several </p><p>foreign manufacturing firms. </p><p> </p><p>In theory once a company has the "Permit to Trade" it may </p><p>then use it to get residence visa status, lease cars and real </p><p>estate, etc., and to get import and export licenses from the </p><p>Ministry of Commerce.  The Ministry of Commerce has had a </p><p>policy in place since the end of 2001, though there is </p><p>nothing in writing, to only issue import licenses to those </p><p>firms who are export earners. </p><p> </p><p>The existing foreign investment law and its procedures are </p><p>positive for investors on paper.  However, in practice, it is </p><p>very difficult to make the system work properly due to poor </p><p>transparency and corruption all along the line.  The senior </p><p>generals making the decisions do not seriously consider the </p><p>law when they want to take action for or against investors. </p><p> </p><p>The FIL allows for FDI as a wholly foreign-owned venture or a </p><p>joint venture with any Burmese partner (individual, private </p><p>company, or state-owned company).  Sole proprietorships or </p><p>partnerships are equally acceptable.  Overall, the FIL </p><p>requires that at least 35 percent of equity capital in all </p><p>JVs and partnerships be foreign-owned.  Officially, the </p><p>minimum foreign investment is $500,000 for manufacturing </p><p>investments and $300,000 for services. </p><p> </p><p>The military, via the military economic enterprises, the </p><p>Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (UMEHL) and the </p><p>Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), is involved in many </p><p>economic activities.  To set up a joint venture, foreign </p><p>firms have reported that it is useful to be affiliated with </p><p>MEHL or MEC in order to receive the proper business permits. </p><p>Nonetheless, entering into business with MEHL or MEC does not </p><p>guarantee success for the foreign partner, and some foreign </p><p>investors report that their military partners are parasitic, </p><p>making unreasonable demands, providing no cost-sharing, and </p><p>sometimes muscling out the foreign investor after an </p><p>investment is up and running. </p><p> </p><p>5. Conversion and Transfer Policies </p><p> </p><p>According to the Foreign Investment Law, investors in Burma </p><p>have a guarantee that they can repatriate profits (after </p><p>taxes).  The law also provides that, upon expiry of the term </p><p>of the contract, the investor of foreign capital has the </p><p>right to the foreign currency in which the investment was </p><p>made.  However, due to the shortage of foreign exchange it is </p><p>in reality not easy for foreign investors to legally transfer </p><p>their net profits abroad.  Foreign currency can be </p><p>transferred abroad only after obtaining permission from the </p><p>Foreign Exchange Management Department of the Central Bank of </p><p>Myanmar. </p><p> </p><p>Likewise, multiple exchange rates in Burma make conversion </p><p>and repatriation of foreign exchange very complex and ripe </p><p>for corruption.  The official rate of 6 kyat to the dollar is </p><p>grossly overvalued.  The government issues Foreign Exchange </p><p>Certificates (FEC) that trade somewhat closer to the market </p><p>rate but are still overvalued.  Generally speaking, foreign </p><p>companies get rid of kyat earnings as quickly as possible -- </p><p>usually by purchasing FEC or dollars at some variant of the </p><p>market rate.  The government has allowed foreign companies to </p><p>use dollars or FEC to pay utility and telephone bills, and </p><p>rental charges.  It has also allowed foreign firms to deposit </p><p>dollars in a state bank for withdrawal as FEC by the </p><p>company\'s employees. </p><p>In Burma, only three state banks, the Myanma Economic Bank </p><p>(MEB), the Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), and </p><p>the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) are allowed to deal with </p><p>foreign exchange transactions.  In practice the MFTB and MICB </p><p>handle most of these transactions.  The MFTB mainly handles </p><p>foreign currency transactions of government organizations, </p><p>businesses, and individuals, and the MICB caters primarily to </p><p>companies and joint ventures.  MEB handles foreign currency </p><p>transactions in border trade regions. </p><p> </p><p>Because most of Burma,s international trade is done in U.S. </p><p>dollars, the restrictions on provisions of financial services </p><p>by U.S. banks will cause serious disruption to the legal </p><p>foreign trading system.  U.S. banks will no longer be able to </p><p>offer trade facilitation or correspondent banking services, </p><p>making the use of U.S. dollar letters of credit problematic. </p><p> </p><p>As of July 29, 2003, the correspondent accounts of MEB, MFTB, </p><p>and MICB in the United States are frozen, along with all </p><p>other assets and property. </p><p> </p><p>Private banks, despite assuming a large share of banking </p><p>activity in the last several years, are not permitted to deal </p><p>in foreign exchange.  In February 2003 there was a major run </p><p>on private banks, and as of now their future is uncertain. </p><p>However, there is no indication that if the private banking </p><p>system is revitalized it will be given the right to deal in </p><p>foreign currency. </p><p> </p><p>6. Expropriation and Compensation </p><p> </p><p>The Burmese Foreign Investment Law provides guarantees </p><p>against nationalization during the investment\'s "permitted </p><p>period" of investment.  However, a number of foreign firms in </p><p>various sectors have been forced to leave the country when </p><p>the terms and conditions of their investment agreements have </p><p>not been honored.  In recent years two large Japanese firms </p><p>exited Burma after they found they were not able to operate </p><p>as they had been led to believe.  Additionally, there have </p><p>been cases where the government has seized the assets of </p><p>foreign and local investors (without compensation), when the </p><p>investment turned out to be very profitable. </p><p> </p><p>The most recent example we know of is the case of a Swiss </p><p>cement importer and distributor that was forced out </p><p>ostensibly because it was not operating according to its </p><p>permit.  In reality, the government turned the company out, </p><p>after significant investment in plant and equipment, because </p><p>the investor was able to sell better quality, cheaper cement </p><p>than its government-controlled competitors.   In another case </p><p>in 1999-2000, the military-owned MEC confiscated a large </p><p>brewery that an expatriate Burmese businesswoman had made </p><p>profitable.  The local courts were not helpful and to date </p><p>the investor has been unable to get compensation from the GOB. </p><p> </p><p>7. Dispute Settlement </p><p> </p><p>Private and foreign companies are at a disadvantage in </p><p>disputes with government organizations.  Arbitration is </p><p>addressed under the 1944 Arbitration Act.  Foreign investors </p><p>generally prefer to use international arbitration, though the </p><p>Burmese government will try to stipulate local arbitration in </p><p>contracts it signs with foreign investors.   If handled </p><p>locally, difficulties arise since the central leadership </p><p>controls the whole legal mechanism.  The courts are not </p><p>independent and cannot make free and fair decisions.  There </p><p>is no recourse available for companies who face an adverse </p><p>administrative decision.  Burma is not a member of the </p><p>International Center for the Settlement of Investment </p><p>Disputes nor is it a party to the New York Convention. </p><p> </p><p>The legal system in Burma is ostensibly under the control of </p><p>the Attorney General\'s Office and the Supreme Court. </p><p>However, neither the Attorney General nor the Supreme Court </p><p>is independent.  Burmese criminal and civil laws are modeled </p><p>on British law as practiced during the colonial period -- </p><p>which ended in 1948.  Every township, state, and division has </p><p>its own law officers and judges.  However, the township, </p><p>state and divisional SPDC branches have supreme authority </p><p>over judicial decisions at the local level. </p><p> </p><p>There is no bankruptcy law in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign companies have the right to bring cases, and defend </p><p>themselves, in local courts.  However, as the SPDC ruling </p><p>junta controls all the courts, foreign investors who have had </p><p>conflicts with the local government, or even had their </p><p>business illegally expropriated, have had little luck getting </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p>8. Performance Requirements and Incentives </p><p> </p><p>Officially, companies covered under the Foreign Investment </p><p>Law are entitled to a tax holiday period of three consecutive </p><p>years.  Under the law this tax holiday can be extended with </p><p>permission of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC). </p><p>Investors are also eligible, at the MIC,s discretion, for a </p><p>number of other incentives including: accelerated </p><p>depreciation of capital assets, a waiver of customs duties </p><p>and taxes on imported machinery and spare parts during the </p><p>period of construction, or on imported raw materials during </p><p>the first three years of commercial production, etc.  Again, </p><p>the TPC and the Cabinet, not the MIC, make decisions on these </p><p>incentives and extensions. </p><p> </p><p>There are no official performance requirements for new </p><p>foreign investors in Burma, but the government does require </p><p>an investor purchase local machinery, fire, marine, and </p><p>personal liability insurance.  Unofficially, the government </p><p>often requires companies to commit to a certain level of </p><p>exports before being allowed to invest.  The government then </p><p>requires compliance reports every three months with evidence </p><p>of export or explanation why the goals were not met.  We have </p><p>no evidence that action is taken against firms that do not </p><p>meet their initial export targets. </p><p> </p><p>There is no requirement that foreign investors buy or hire </p><p>from local sources.  Technology transfer is not generally a </p><p>pre-requisite for investment. </p><p> </p><p>According to Burmese law, any enterprise operating under the </p><p>Foreign Investment Law or the Myanmar Companies Act must pay </p><p>a 30 percent income tax rate.  Withholding tax on royalties </p><p>and interest is 15 percent for resident foreigners and 20 </p><p>percent for non-resident foreigners.  Tax collection in Burma </p><p>is very lax, but foreign investors are an easy target for the </p><p>cash-strapped tax authorities.  The Burmese fiscal year ends </p><p>March 31 and tax returns are due by June 30. </p><p> </p><p>A surprising reversal of the government\'s mantra of "open </p><p>door economy" came in a February 2002 verbal directive which </p><p>outlawed the issuance of new, or renewal of existing, </p><p>"Permits to Trade" for trading firms owned by foreigners (or </p><p>by foreigners and Burmese).  This was done ostensibly to </p><p>promote local trading firms, but has served only to further </p><p>distort the local marketplace.  The authorities have not </p><p>published any official notice of this directive but it is </p><p>being enforced, including against foreigners who have tried </p><p>to evade the directive by listing their company under the </p><p>name of a Burmese colleague or friend. </p><p> </p><p>9. Right to Private Ownership and Establishment </p><p> </p><p>By law, foreigners may not own land, and may only rent </p><p>property on a short-term basis. </p><p> </p><p>A private entity can establish, buy, sell, and own a business </p><p>only with the review and approval of the MIC (and by proxy </p><p>the top leadership). </p><p> </p><p>10. Protection of Property Rights </p><p> </p><p>Burma does not yet have adequate IPR protection.  Patent, </p><p>trademark, and copyright laws and regulations are all </p><p>deficient.  Thus Burma is unlikely to meet WTO TRIPS </p><p>obligations in the near to medium term.  After Burma joined </p><p>ASEAN in 1997, it agreed to modernize its intellectual </p><p>property laws in accordance with the ASEAN Framework </p><p>Agreement on Intellectual Property Cooperation.  However, an </p><p>IPR law, first drafted in 1994, still awaits approval and </p><p>implementation.  A Patents and Design Act was introduced in </p><p>1946, but never brought into force.  Thus the Indian Patents </p><p>and Designs Act of 1911, which was enacted under British </p><p>colonial rule, continues to govern the registration of </p><p>patents and designs. </p><p> </p><p>Piracy of music CDs, video CDs, CD-ROMS, DVDs, books, </p><p>software, and designs is evident nationwide, especially in </p><p>the two major urban centers of Mandalay and Rangoon. </p><p>However, given the small number of customers (most Burmese </p><p>are too poor), and the lack of adequate infrastructure (e.g., </p><p>reliable electricity), we do not believe piracy has a </p><p>significant adverse impact on U.S. products, which, are in </p><p>any case, not readily available.  There is little evidence of </p><p>widespread use of pirated software and hardware by government </p><p>agencies, though the nascent computer and IT sector often </p><p>relies on pirated software for training courses and other </p><p>uses. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has no trademark law, though trademark registration is </p><p>possible.  Some firms place a trademark caution notice in the </p><p>local newspaper, declaring ownership of their trademarks. </p><p>Once this notice has been published, criminal and/or civil </p><p>action can be taken against trademark infringers.  Title to a </p><p>trademark depends on use of the trademark in connection with </p><p>goods sold in Burma.  While a Copyright Act was promulgated </p><p>in 1914, no means to register a copyright was ever </p><p>instituted.  There is thus no legal protection in Burma for </p><p>foreign copyrights. </p><p> </p><p>In the vast majority of cases, real estate is purchased with </p><p>cash or using regular bank loans.  However, there are a few </p><p>banks that offer rudimentary mortgage facilities.  Foreigners </p><p>may not generally avail themselves of this, though, because </p><p>they may not own land. </p><p> </p><p>11. Transparency of the Regulatory System </p><p> </p><p>Burma is notorious among foreign businesspeople for its </p><p>complete lack of regulatory and legal transparency.  All </p><p>existing regulations, including those covering foreign </p><p>investment, import-export procedures, licensing, foreign </p><p>exchange, etc., are subject to change, with no advance </p><p>notice, at the whim of the senior ruling generals.  The </p><p>economic decision-makers here are influenced strongly by </p><p>wealthy cronies, the demands of state-owned enterprises, and </p><p>of the military-controlled Myanmar Economic Corporation and </p><p>the Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.  The government also </p><p>regularly issues new regulations with no notice and with no </p><p>opportunity for review or comment by any non-governmental </p><p>domestic or any foreign market participants.  Furthermore, </p><p>new regulations or regulatory changes are rarely published. </p><p>Instead, they are communicated verbally to interested </p><p>parties.  If a new regulation or law is published it will </p><p>appear in the government\'s mouthpiece newspaper, the New </p><p>Light of Myanmar (Myanma A\'Lin or in the Burma Gazette. </p><p> </p><p>Burma\'s health, environmental, tax, and labor laws as written </p><p>do not impose a major burden on investment.  However, the </p><p>protean nature of the regulatory and legal situation -- and </p><p>the irregular enforcement of existing laws -- makes </p><p>investment tricky without good, and well-connected, local </p><p>legal advice. </p><p> </p><p>12. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment </p><p> </p><p>Burma has no true equity or debt markets, and the notion of </p><p>portfolio investment is not well understood by the average </p><p>person.   Burmese authorities have said in the past that the </p><p>existence of capital markets is essential for the development </p><p>of a well-functioning financial system.  To this end, the </p><p>Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) and Japan\'s Daiwa Institute of </p><p>Research Co. Ltd. established a joint venture, the Myanma </p><p>Security Exchange Centre Ltd., to set up a stock exchange. </p><p>This exchange is in existence, though moribund, with only one </p><p>listed company -- a forestry joint venture.  A few companies </p><p>have also begun to sell bonds privately and on a very small </p><p>scale.  Private companies, both foreign and domestically </p><p>controlled, are generally small and thus their shares are </p><p>closely held by a small number of people or entities -- often </p><p>within a family.  There is a securities law being drafted </p><p>now, but no interested private parties have been allowed to </p><p>see, or comment on, the draft. </p><p> </p><p>A large bank run in February 2003, and the subsequent </p><p>decision by the government to avoid bailouts, has effectively </p><p>cut off the private banking system from the market. The </p><p>state-owned and semi state-owned banks were not impacted by </p><p>this crisis.  Government instructions and internal bank </p><p>policies have made it impossible for private banks to take in </p><p>new deposits or loans, and weekly withdrawals are capped. </p><p>Currently the private banks are in limbo, the government </p><p>indecisive for now on whether to liquidate, actively </p><p>restructure, or rescue the troubled institutions. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign firms do not have access to bank loans since the </p><p>banks require collateral of land or real estate, neither of </p><p>which foreigners can own.  Since mid-2002 the use of gold as </p><p>collateral has been forbidden.  Loans in kyat are available </p><p>for local companies and individuals from state and, until </p><p>February 2003, private banks.  Interest rates are currently </p><p>running about 15 percent per year with inflation about 3 </p><p>times that.  Because of these negative real interest rates, a </p><p>lack of adequate supervision, and a shortage of banking </p><p>experience the private banking system, even at its peak, was </p><p>very unstable.  Private banks engaged in reckless lending and </p><p>suffered high levels of non-performing loans.  Though </p><p>statistics are not available, it is believed that public </p><p>banks, forced to bankroll the regime\'s pet projects and </p><p>personal needs, also have extremely large numbers of </p><p>non-performing loans. </p><p> </p><p>A 1990 banking law permitted foreign banks to open branches </p><p>in Burma but not to conduct business in the local market. </p><p>These offices may serve as a trade and commercial liaison for </p><p>local and foreign clients.   For a variety of reasons, </p><p>including the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the </p><p>slow local business climate, and the lack of liberalization </p><p>of the banking sector, most of the original 49 foreign banks </p><p>have left Burma, or downgraded their representation, in the </p><p>past five years.   U.S. persons may not provide financial </p><p>services to Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has no standard accounting system.  International </p><p>accounting firms in country, though they may offer only </p><p>"consulting services," adhere to the General Accepted </p><p>Accounting Principles (GAAP).  We have heard that the Burmese </p><p>government is trying to establish a separate Myanmar </p><p>Accounting Principles (MAP) system, but this is still on the </p><p>drawing board. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Political Violence </p><p> </p><p>In May 2003, government-affiliated thugs ambushed a convoy </p><p>carrying opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi while she was </p><p>traveling in northwest Burma.  Dozens were killed or wounded </p><p>during the attack.  Two bombs went off in downtown Rangoon in </p><p>early 2003.  A small incendiary device exploded at a downtown </p><p>pagoda in 1996, and Burmese authorities reportedly found </p><p>other bomb devices in 1999 and 2000.  The military government </p><p>tightened security around the international airport in </p><p>Rangoon after two RPG devices were discovered near the </p><p>airport in early 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Burma experienced major political unrest in 1988 when the </p><p>military regime jailed and/or killed an undetermined number </p><p>of Burmese democracy activists.  In 1990, the military </p><p>government refused to recognize the results of an election </p><p>that the opposition won overwhelmingly.  Burma experienced </p><p>major student demonstrations in 1996, and demonstrations </p><p>occurred in August and September of 1998.  Popular unrest and </p><p>violence continue to be possible. </p><p> </p><p>For the last decade there has been sporadic anti-government </p><p>insurgent activity in various locations, such as an attack on </p><p>a natural gas pipeline in the Tanintharyi Division and bomb </p><p>attacks against family members of senior military officials </p><p>in Rangoon.  Chin and Arakan States and the Thai-Burma border </p><p>area in Burma\'s southern Shan, Mon, Karenni, and Karen States </p><p>have been the scenes of occasional fighting between </p><p>government forces and various insurgent groups.  In February </p><p>2001, several people were killed and some tourists left </p><p>stranded during shelling and cross-border gunfire in the town </p><p>of Tachileik, Shan State.  The Thai-Burma border is closed </p><p>from time to time due to increased insurgent activity, most </p><p>recently in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Corruption </p><p> </p><p>Corruption is systemic in Burma and is considered by </p><p>economists and businesspeople to be one of the most serious </p><p>barriers to investment and doing business in Burma.  Because </p><p>of the Byzantine and capricious regulatory environment, </p><p>rent-seeking activities are rampant and very little can be </p><p>accomplished, from the micro to the macro, without paying </p><p>"tea money."  We think this problem will only get worse at </p><p>all levels as inflation and the erosion of the kyat further </p><p>impoverish government bureaucrats and as senior leaders seek </p><p>additional income from a shrinking number of investment </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>Corruption is a jailable offense in Burma, and has been since </p><p>1948.  However, the anti-corruption statute is applied only </p><p>when the senior generals want to take action against some </p><p>official who has become an embarrassment.  In all other cases </p><p>corruption is considered a very normal practice -- indeed a </p><p>requirement for survival.   The major, though by no means </p><p>only, areas where investors run into corruption are: when </p><p>seeking investment permission, taxation, when applying for </p><p>import and export licenses, and, when negotiating land and </p><p>real estate leases. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p> </p><p>Burma has signed bilateral investment agreements, known as </p><p>"Protection and Promotion of Investment" agreements with the </p><p>Philippines, the PRC, and Vietnam.  Except for increasing </p><p>investment from the PRC, these agreements have had little </p><p>impact on incoming investment from Vietnam or the Philippines. </p><p> </p><p>16.  OPIC and Other Insurance Programs </p><p> </p><p>Due to U.S. law OPIC does not operate in Burma.  Burma is not </p><p>a member of the World Bank\'s Multilateral Investment </p><p>Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </p><p> </p><p>17.  Labor </p><p> </p><p>In 1989, the United States withdrew Burma\'s eligibility for </p><p>benefits under the generalized system of preferences (GSP) </p><p>due to the absence of internationally recognized worker </p><p>rights.  Labor unions are illegal in Burma.  Workers are </p><p>unable to organize, negotiate, or in any other way exercise </p><p>control over their working conditions.  Although regulations </p><p>set a minimum employment age and wage, and maximum work </p><p>hours, these are not uniformly observed, especially in </p><p>private factories and other establishments.  The government </p><p>uses forced adult labor in infrastructure construction and </p><p>porterage for the military in active combat zones.  These </p><p>labor practices are not consistent with Burma\'s obligations </p><p>under ILO Conventions 29 and 87, and thus explain why the ILO </p><p>imposed sanctions against Burma in 2000.  The United States </p><p>strongly supported this decision. </p><p> </p><p>Burma,s cost of labor is very low, even compared to some of </p><p>its Southeast Asian neighbors.  Burmese over the age of 40, </p><p>and particularly those over 65, tend to be very well </p><p>educated.  However, a sad side effect of the repeated closing </p><p>of Burmese universities over the past 15 years is that the </p><p>current 15-30 year old demographic is sorely lacking in </p><p>technical skills.  Many Burmese, though, speak at least some </p><p>level of English.  Many educated Burmese studied English in </p><p>mission schools during the British colonial and early </p><p>independence period.  After the nationalization of private </p><p>and mission schools in 1964, the socialist government </p><p>mandated English courses in school starting from the middle </p><p>school.  However, soon thereafter then-dictator General Ne </p><p>Win ordered that English instruction begin in kindergarten </p><p>after his daughter failed an English exam and was rejected </p><p>for studies in the U.K. </p><p> </p><p>The government does not publish unemployment figures. </p><p>However, anecdotal evidence and the recent divestment by many </p><p>foreign companies, support the assumption of a very high </p><p>level of unemployed and underemployed in non-agricultural </p><p>sectors.  An average factory worker in Burma will make about </p><p>500-800 kyat per day. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports </p><p> </p><p>The government has set aside as "industrial zones" large </p><p>tracts of land surrounding Rangoon and Mandalay.  However, </p><p>these zones are merely zoned for industry and do not come </p><p>with any investment incentives. </p><p> </p><p>There are no free trade zones in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Foreign Direct Investment Statistics </p><p> </p><p>Note:  Investment figures published by the GOB include only </p><p>investment approved by the Myanmar Investment Commission </p><p>(MIC).  These figures do not include investments not </p><p>submitted for MIC approval, such as a myriad of small and </p><p>medium Chinese projects. </p><p> </p><p>According to government figures at the end of March 2003, </p><p>cumulative foreign investment approved by the MIC totaled 371 </p><p>projects, valued at US$7.5 billion.  This amount is 1.2 </p><p>percent higher than the cumulative total listed at the end of </p><p>March 2002.   However, it should be noted that this </p><p>cumulative number does not factor in subsequent divestment, </p><p>or investment that was approved but that did not actually </p><p>enter the country. </p><p> </p><p>Extrapolating from the latest government statistics on FDI </p><p>flow for the Burmese FY 2002-03 (April-March), we estimate a </p><p>357 percent year-on-year increase in new FDI approvals </p><p>($86.95 million) in 4 sectors compared with total new </p><p>investment approvals in FY 2001-02 ($19.002 million).  The </p><p>new investments came from Malaysia ($44 million in oil and </p><p>gas and $18.25 million in fishery), Hong Kong ($12.88 million </p><p>in manufacturing), Singapore ($6.1 million in fishery), </p><p>Switzerland ($3.38 million in mining), Brunei ($2.04 million </p><p>in fishery) and Korea ($0.3 million in manufacturing). </p><p> </p><p>Despite the hangover from the Asian financial crisis, the </p><p>trickle of approved new investment since 1997 has come almost </p><p>exclusively from Asian countries.  Malaysia, Singapore, </p><p>Switzerland, and Korea registered new investment in Burma in </p><p>FY 2002-03.  Western countries have largely stayed away from </p><p>the Burma market.  U.S. investment has been zero since 1997 </p><p>when the U.S. government imposed an investment ban. </p><p> </p><p>In stock terms, the United States is the fifth largest </p><p>foreign investor in Burma with 16 projects totaling US$582 </p><p>million.  U.S. investment approved prior to May 1997, which </p><p>was grandfathered under the U.S. investment sanctions order, </p><p>is largely centered in oil and natural gas exploration.  The </p><p>small number of other U.S. firms in Burma is involved </p><p>primarily in tourism, management, consulting, and trading. </p><p>While Malaysia is ranked 4th in FDI stock, it was 1st in new </p><p>FDI agreements in 2002-03 (according to Burmese government </p><p>statistics).  These official statistics do not take into </p><p>consideration considerable new investment, some of it </p><p>state-financed, from the PRC. </p><p> </p><p>Major non-U.S. foreign investors in Burma are: Petronas </p><p>(Malaysia), Total (France), Ivanhoe Mines (Canada), PTT, Plc. </p><p>(Thailand), Shin Satellite (Thailand), Keppel Land </p><p>(Singapore), China National Construction and Agricultural </p><p>Machinery Import and Export Co. (PRC), and the China </p><p>International Trust and Investment Corporation (PRC). </p><p> </p><p>So far there is no concrete evidence of large-scale </p><p>investment abroad by Burmese companies.  However, we believe </p><p>that some wealthy Burmese individuals and small family </p><p>businesses have made a few investments in neighboring ASEAN </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT OF PERMITTED ENTERPRISES AS OF </p><p>3/31/2003 BY SECTOR </p><p> </p><p>                  (US$ million) </p><p>                  Approved    In percent of Total </p><p>No.   Particulars No.   Amount      Approved Amount </p><p> </p><p>1.
