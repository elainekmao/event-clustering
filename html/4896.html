<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, AMGT, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ adds more price controls </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The macroeconomically-challenged GOZ expanded </p><p>its price freeze list on December 28. New controls will </p><p>lead to further shortages and a burgeoning black market. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Over the past months, the GOZ has rapidly expanded its </p><p>price freeze.  The latest list includes school uniforms, </p><p>tracksuits, toothpaste and a host of other products.  The </p><p>GOZ is attempting to rein in inflation, which it now </p><p>officially -- and very conservatively -- pegs at 175 </p><p>percent.  Unlike previous controls, this latest series </p><p>fixes rates that are higher than current market prices. </p><p>For that reason, it will take several months for </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s inflation to lift market-determined prices to </p><p>the officially-sanctioned maximums. </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment: Price controls will continue to cause rather </p><p>than alleviate high inflation.  The GOZ is fixing the </p><p>prices of every item it can think of while trying to </p><p>clamp down on the repackaging game.  (Bureaucrats at the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade must now approve each new </p><p>product.)  Unrealistically low price freezes have caused </p><p>widespread shortages, making it unprofitable to produce </p><p>maize, bread, sugar, meat, milk and cooking oil.  We </p><p>expect the list of "endangered" staples to grow as firms </p><p>shut down unprofitable product lines.  Low supply/heavy </p><p>demand in the informal marketplace will soon push real </p><p>inflation to hyper- or near hyper-levels. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
