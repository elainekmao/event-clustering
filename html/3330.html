<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003958 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Travel Restrictions for Palestinians Crossing </p><p>Jordanian border-Feeding Public Concern Over a Possible </p><p>Transfer </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  Tales of West Bank Palestinians stuck at the Jericho </p><p>border crossing have been prominent in conversations </p><p>throughout Jordan in recent weeks.  Rumors and anecdotal </p><p>reports of thousands stranded - some for over a week - </p><p>waiting either for Israel to lift the curfew so they can </p><p>return to their villages, or for Jordan to admit them, have </p><p>triggered conflicting emotions for many here, focused </p><p>largely on the question of whether Israel intends to </p><p>engineer a large-scale transfer of Palestinians, and how the </p><p>Jordanian Government should respond.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Palestinian border crossing: Old New Problem </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Jordanian officials are evidently nervous about the </p><p>image solidifying in the public imagination of Palestinians </p><p>suffering at the hands of insensitive Jordanian border </p><p>officials, and have issued a statement reiterating Jordan\'s </p><p>open bridge policy.  Minister of State for Political Affairs </p><p>Mohammed Adwan stated on July 10; "The open bridges policy </p><p>remains our national strategy to help strengthen the </p><p>steadfastness of the Palestinians." While numerous press </p><p>reports claim the Jordan has limited the number of </p><p>Palestinians allowed to enter the country to 350 a day 9 </p><p>(from 3000 in the past), officials deny taking such measures </p><p>and claim that the number admitted on a daily basis is </p><p>around 1000.  Priority is given to medical cases and the </p><p>rest are investigated for "precautionary measures" to make </p><p>sure that Palestinians who visit Jordan will return to the </p><p>West Bank.  The Minister of Interior has announced publicly </p><p>"We will not accept any transfer of Palestinians into </p><p>Jordan."  Here in Jordan, there is a strong consensus among </p><p>both Palestinians and Jordanians that West Bank Palestinians </p><p>would remain on their lands and not repeat the tragedy of </p><p>prior refugee flows in 1948 and 1967.  Both Palestinians and </p><p>Jordanians fear that Sharon\'s ultimate agenda is the </p><p>wholesale transfer of West Bank Palestinians to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>What it means for Palestinians: Vignettes of opinions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. "This is an old new problem" according to Fawzi Samhouri, </p><p>Director of Jordan Society for Citizen Rights, a prominent </p><p>human rights group. The problem started last year when the </p><p>Jordanian Ministry of Interior issued new procedures to </p><p>Palestinians wishing to visit Jordan. The procedures limited </p><p>the reasons for travel to humanitarian reasons. After a rush </p><p>of criticism, debate died. Now, however, "there is a feeling </p><p>that Israel wants to push the Palestinians out, and there </p><p>are rumors of transfer. . .This is making Jordanians very </p><p>nervous". </p><p> </p><p>4. Dr. Nitham Assaf of the Amman Center for Human Rights </p><p>believes that talk of a transfer is irresponsible-on the </p><p>part of the government or the chattering classes:  "From a </p><p>human rights perspective, Jordan should be facilitating </p><p>entry and not creating additional barriers." He feels that </p><p>Jordan is using people\'s fear of transfer to suppress </p><p>freedom of movement. "If transfer is a real threat, then why </p><p>not close the borders. If Jordan wants to support the </p><p>steadfastness of the Palestinians, then they should allow </p><p>them entry to regain their strength in order to go back and </p><p>stand strong in the face of the occupation." This to him </p><p>looks like "a war from two sides on one people." </p><p> </p><p>5. For another Jordanian intellectual, the truth of the </p><p>matter remains unclear. The Arab media, he believes is </p><p>acting irresponsibly by trafficking in rumors and blame. He </p><p>states that no one knows the truth, "all we know for a fact </p><p>is that there are people stuck on the border, Jordan blames </p><p>Israel and vice versa." On the one hand Jordanian officials </p><p>carefully state that the number of arrivals equals that of </p><p>the departures, and on the other they issue contradictory </p><p>statements about "precautionary measures" to stop a </p><p>transfer. The same contact opined that "it is too premature </p><p>to create havoc - as no one knows the real story." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>And It All Comes Down to the Transfer Questions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. Many Embassy contacts say that Jordan should open its </p><p>gates as long as the number of arrivals equals the number of </p><p>departures.  One Palestinian contact said "90 percent of </p><p>those who leave, do so for pressing medical needs, education </p><p>for their children, or transit via Jordan, 10 percent leave </p><p>for pleasure." Jordanians of Palestinian origin have family </p><p>ties and would like to welcome their relatives, however many </p><p>trans-Jordanians have expressed fear that history will </p><p>repeat itself. One trans-Jordanian stated "In 1948 we had </p><p>refugees running from the occupation, in 1967 we had a flood </p><p>of humanitarian refugees, and in 1991 we had returnees who </p><p>were expelled from the Gulf, and now what? Transfer?" </p><p> </p><p>7. A Jordanian intellectual explained what all this means to </p><p>him:  "This is part of the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank </p><p>that  has gone on since 1967." He believes that only  severe </p><p>hardship  cases  should be allowed to  leave.  On  the  same </p><p>issue, a Jordanian woman feels torn: "If my cousin from  the </p><p>West  Bank  wants desperately to visit me, then I can\'t  say </p><p>no, but I know in the larger picture, everyone has a cousin! </p><p>If everyone acted on their emotion, then we let Sharon win." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Jordanians from all walks of life fear that the long-term </p><p>plans   of   Israel   threaten  Jordanian  and   Palestinian </p><p>identities. Transfer is on every ones mind. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
