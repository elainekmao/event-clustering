MY QUESTION NOW IS WHO IS GOING TO BEAR THE </p><p>    BRUNT OF THIS UNCALLED FOR WAR?  IS IT GOING TO BE </p><p>    OSAMA BIN LADEN OR THE INNOCENT CITIZENS?  THE </p><p>    AMERICANS DO NOT GIVE A DAMN AS LONG AS THEY ARE </p><p>    SATISFIED THEY HAVE REVENGED.  THIS IS WHERE I ALWAYS </p><p>    HATE THE AMERICANS AND HAVE BRANDED THEM THE MOST </p><p>    VICIOUS BULLIES ON THIS PLANET.  THE ONLY PRUDENT THING </p><p>    FOR THEM TO DO IS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE AFGHAN </p><p>    GOVERNMENT AND OTHER ARAB STATES TO TRY TO FIND AN </p><p>    AMICABLE WAY OF STOPPING THESE TERRORISTS ACTIVITIES </p><p>    RATHER THAN RESORTING TO WAR. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>8.
