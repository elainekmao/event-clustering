O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KIPR, KTEX, VM, IPROP </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM IPR ENFORCEMENT SUCCESS STORY:  NIKE </p><p>COUNTERFEITER LOSES BIG </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 HCMC 934 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  In an IPR enforcement success story, the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>Economic Police have wrapped up a case against a major </p><p>counterfeiter of Nike footwear.  Although fines relating to IPR </p><p>violations were nominal, local authorities assessed substantial </p><p>fines for tax evasion and confiscated supplies and production </p><p>equipment.  These fines and forfeitures amount to more than </p><p>US$160,000.  Nike had high praise for the Economic Police, but </p><p>faulted the People\'s Procurator in Ho Chi Minh City for dragging </p><p>its feet. </p><p> </p><p>Nike Counterfeiter Raided in Summer 2002 </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  In July 2002 the Ho Chi Minh City Economic Police raided a </p><p>workshop producing high quality counterfeit Nike shoes and other </p><p>famous brands. The raid, as reported in reftel, resulted in the </p><p>seizure of 23 truckloads of fake components, supplies, and </p><p>production equipment.  The case had been initiated at the request </p><p>of Nike, which had been compiling information on this enterprise </p><p>for about a year.  This producer had been targeted by Nike because </p><p>the operation appeared to be large and was producing high quality </p><p>fakes.  Interestingly, the case came to the attention of Nike </p><p>through a tip from another (rival) counterfeiter. </p><p> </p><p>Follow up reveals national network with large turnover </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>3.  Following up on the raid, the police found a national </p><p>distribution network with retail outlets in Hanoi, Haiphong, and </p><p>Danang.  The police traced bank transfers of funds indicating that </p><p>the business generated revenues equivalent to at least US$100,000 </p><p>for the 18 months leading up to the raids.  Even with all of this </p><p>evidence, however, authorities decided that they could not </p><p>prosecute this case as a criminal case.  The raid netted 23 </p><p>truckloads of production equipment and supplies, but only 47 pairs </p><p>of counterfeit Nike shoes.  Because the value of actual </p><p>counterfeit products was so low, the police, along with the </p><p>People\'s Procurator\'s Office, determined that the case had to be </p><p>handled as an administrative matter.  In an administrative case, </p><p>local authorities only have the power to assess limited fines and </p><p>confiscate equipment, product and supplies.  In a criminal case, </p><p>the case would be heard in court and fines could be higher and </p><p>jail terms could be handed down. </p><p> </p><p>Let the Punishment Fit the Crime </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>4.  This did not stop local authorities from taking full advantage </p><p>of their authority to assess administrative penalties in this </p><p>case.  These fines and forfeitures were spelled out in a decision </p><p>from the local District People\'s Committee dated February 25, </p><p>2003.  The actual fine based on IPR was very low- only VND 500,000 </p><p>(about US$325).  The real penalties were assessed in other areas. </p><p>The local Taxation Department imposed a penalty of VND 132,319,000 </p><p>(about US$8600) for back taxes and tax evasion. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The District People\'s Committee also authorized the permanent </p><p>confiscation of the production equipment seized in the raid.  This </p><p>included: </p><p>-    US$26,000 worth of production equipment </p><p>-    US$$19,500 worth of synthetic leather (2078 kilograms) </p><p>-    US$1200 worth of cement (ten tanks) </p><p> According to Nike, this equipment and the supplies will be sold </p><p>and revenue turned over to the state budget. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The police were also granted authority to destroy components </p><p>seized in the raid.  These included: </p><p>-    $117,000 worth of fake Nike shoe components (completed uppers </p><p>and unit soles) which could be used to make 15,000 pairs of fake </p><p>Nike shoes. </p><p>-    Additional components that could be used to manufacture </p><p>counterfeits of other name-brand sport shoes. </p><p> </p><p>7.  These penalties are impressively large.  They are even more </p><p>impressive when considering that the individual who owned this </p><p>operation is a relative of a powerful People\'s Committee chairman </p><p>in a neighboring district.  This appears not to have influenced </p><p>the progress of the case.  Nike reports, however, that the </p><p>counterfeiter may be trying to set up another operation to produce </p><p>counterfeit goods in another district in the city.  Nike plans to </p><p>monitor developments closely and work with local police to follow </p><p>up. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  While one such event does not indicate a sea change in the </p><p>difficult IPR environment here, this case - in which a politically </p><p>connected individual was made to pay dearly for flagrant </p><p>production of counterfeit goods - is good news indeed.  Nike </p><p>praised the work of the Economic Police, although Nike\'s expert on </p><p>counterfeiting stated that he felt the People\'s Procurator were </p><p>slow to respond to the case.  Nike has no illusions about the IPR </p><p>climate in Vietnam, but hopes to build on this case for further </p><p>cooperation with local authorities.  Post will follow up with </p><p>local authorities to compliment the Economic Police on their </p><p>handling of this case. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
