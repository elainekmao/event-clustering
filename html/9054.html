<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, IZ, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\'S INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>AL-HAYAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Begin summary:  A recent interview with Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussein al-Ahmar provides an </p><p>illustrative example typifying the views of this prominent </p><p>Yemeni political figure.  Al-Ahmar is known for his </p><p>controversial ideas as demonstrated in a June 20 interview </p><p>with London-based daily Al-Hayat in which he criticized the </p><p>Arab response to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the </p><p>situation in Iraq, condemned the Sharm-al-Sheikh and Aqaba </p><p>summits and described the domestic political scene from his </p><p>vantage point as leader of Yemen\'s second largest party. See </p><p>biographic note in paragraph 8.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Palestinian-Israeli Conflict </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In a 6/20 interview with the London-based daily </p><p>Al-Hayat, Yemeni Speaker of Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar </p><p>denounced "Arab pressures on the Palestinian groups to stop </p><p>the legitimate resistance against the Zionist occupation" and </p><p>criticized the Roadmap.  He explained that Arab opposition to </p><p>the Palestinian issue is the result of "defeat, internal </p><p>fear, and the inability to say no to the occupation and </p><p>Zionist terrorism."  Sheikh al-Ahmar condemned the </p><p>Sharm-al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits because "they turned the </p><p>resistance, martyrdom, and the jihad against Zionism into </p><p>terrorism."  He asked "what dignity and value is left for the </p><p>Arabs if they abandon the legitimacy of the Palestinian </p><p>resistance?  How can they confront Israel with all its </p><p>military capabilities and American support without the </p><p>resistance?"  Al-Ahmar surmised that "martyrdom and the jihad </p><p>card is the only thing left to confront Israel.  The Arabs </p><p>should defend all the Palestinian factions in order to </p><p>continue the free and legitimate resistance." </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Sheikh al-Ahmar blamed Arab states for the situation </p><p>in Iraq saying that "had it not been for the green light from </p><p>some Arab and Muslim states, the U.S wouldn\'t have invaded </p><p>and occupied Iraq."  Al-Ahmar believes "Arab states are </p><p>responsible for what is happening (in Iraq) after the fall of </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s regime under the pretext of the existence of </p><p>weapons of mass destruction.  The Americans have no excuse </p><p>anymore for slaughtering and annihilating the Iraqi people </p><p>and destroying the country.  It is impermissible to remain </p><p>silent over the massacres, violation of honor, desecration of </p><p>land and holy site that is taking place now in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Domestic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Discussing domestic issues for the first since the </p><p>April 27 parliamentary elections, al-Ahmar said that Yemen\'s </p><p>political situation is "better than that of the other Arab </p><p>countries despite the cracks and violation."  Commenting on </p><p>President Saleh\'s recent decision to pardon 16 former ROYG </p><p>officials living in exile, he declared that "President Saleh </p><p>is known for his leniency and his care for all the sons of </p><p>Yemen."  Al-Ahmar denied that he ever objected to or voiced </p><p>any reservations about the pardon, saying that he has always </p><p>supported "closing the pages of the past" for Yemen\'s </p><p>interest and stability.  Sheikh al-Ahmar said that during the </p><p>campaign for the April 27 parliamentary elections "the Islah </p><p>alliance with the YSP and other opposition parties...under </p><p>the umbrella of the Joint Meeting Parties was a natural </p><p>phenomenon."  However, he admitted that he was not one of </p><p>those who supported this experiment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Al-Ahmar disclosed a tension between GPC and Islah </p><p>"due to the violations, extortion, and pressure by the ruling </p><p>party against Islah during the elections," but stressed that </p><p>"this tension does not pose a danger to security and </p><p>stability in Yemen."  He described it as a temporary </p><p>disagreement that coincided with the elections and will not </p><p>turn into ongoing confrontations.  Continuing, he added that </p><p>had it not been for the Islah leadership\'s flexible and </p><p>patient policy the elections could have been a catastrophe. </p><p>Had the election been fair, which al-Ahmar asserted it was </p><p>not, he believes Islah would have won twice as many seats. </p><p>He added that YSP was expected to win the largest number of </p><p>seats, but "the GPC worked to turn everything in its favor." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  In the aftermath of the 4/27 elections, al-Ahmar </p><p>said that although Prime Minister Ba Jammal\'s government was </p><p>granted confidence by the majority of the ruling party MPs, </p><p>there were those who questioned the new program, but "were </p><p>afraid of being held accountable later if they blocked the </p><p>vote of confidence."  Returning to the ROYG line, al-Ahmar </p><p>re-affirmed his condemnation of all acts of terrorism and </p><p>expressed his support for President Saleh\'s policies in </p><p>combating terrorism and promoting security and stability in </p><p>Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Comment and Bio Note </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Begin comment:  The 70-year old Yemeni Speaker of </p><p>Parliament is also the foremost sheikh of the Hashid tribe </p><p>and chairman of Islah (an Islamist-oriented reform party and </p><p>the second largest political party in Yemen).  His status as </p><p>tribal leader, business leader and Speaker of Parliament </p><p>allows al-Ahmar a prominent platform.  Sheikh al-Ahmar is </p><p>well-known for his anti-U.S. rhetoric and, more recently, his </p><p>opposition to the inclusion of female candidates in the 4/27 </p><p>parliamentary elections.  For him, the tribe and its </p><p>authority are above everything else.  His comments to </p><p>Al-Hayat are consistent with his conservative ideals, </p><p>represent a broad spectrum of thought in Yemen and illustrate </p><p>areas of continued tension between his followers and more </p><p>moderate elements in Yemen.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Begin bio note:  Sheikh al-Ahmar was born in the </p><p>Amran governorate in 1933.  He was active in the national </p><p>struggle against Imamite rule and was imprisoned in 1959 by </p><p>the late Imam Ahmed.  (Imam Ahmed also executed al-Ahmar\'s </p><p>father and brother.)  Al-Ahmar was released from prison after </p><p>the 1962 revolution against the Imam, and led the Hashid </p><p>tribes in defense of the revolution and the republic.  He was </p><p>appointed as a member of the Presidential Council, formed </p><p>after the 1962 revolution, and was Minister of Interior in </p><p>three consecutive cabinets.  In 1969, al-Ahmar was elected </p><p>Chairman of the National Council that was tasked with </p><p>drafting the constitution, and in 1972 he was elected </p><p>Chairman of the Shura Council.  After unification and the </p><p>declaration of political pluralism, al-Ahmar called for the </p><p>formation of the Islah party.  Al-Ahmar became the first </p><p>Speaker of Parliament in 1993, and was re-elected in 1997, </p><p>2000 and 2003.  Four of his sons are members of the newly </p><p>elected parliament: two are Islahis, while the other two </p><p>represent GPC (the ruling party).
