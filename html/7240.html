<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000856 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA, WHA/CCA, WHA/CEN, DRL, AND INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, ETTC, PINR, CU, HO, UNHCR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE CANDIDATES TO SERVE AS FIRST HONDURAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CUBA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 826 </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 763 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Roger Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Honduran Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has not </p><p>yet named a Honduran ambassador to Cuba.  Several names have </p><p>been circulating as potential candidates.  As noted in reftel </p><p>B, first among these is Rene Arturo Bendana, former </p><p>Ambassador to Spain and to the U.S. under past President </p><p>Rafael Callejas.  Bendana, who owns an agribusiness, went to </p><p>college in Mississippi and is pro-U.S.  Bendana is considered </p><p>the "dark side" candidate from the Nationalist Party.  He was </p><p>reportedly offered the Cuba ambassadorship by Nationalist </p><p>Party officials, but has not received an official offer from </p><p>the MFA.  It appears that Bendana will accept the post should </p><p>he receive an official offer. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Two other candidate names have been circulating among </p><p>political sources: Fernando MARTINEZ Jimenez, an architect by </p><p>profession, was Foreign Minister during the Carlos Flores </p><p>government.  Born in 1944 in Comayaguela, Martinez graduated </p><p>from the University of Kansas and is married to an American </p><p>whom he met there, Karen Mary Casey.  Martinez\'s tenure as </p><p>Foreign Minister was notable for its philosophy that Honduran </p><p>foreign policy should reflect domestic policy, thus "serving </p><p>the entire country": an idea that boosted Martinez\'s </p><p>popularity greatly.  Martinez pruned the Foreign Service </p><p>staff from 252 people to 120, firing those whom he considered </p><p>unnecessary or corrupt.  Martinez left the office of Foreign </p><p>Minister in January 1999 after a tumultuous tenure. </p><p>Then-President Flores asked him to resign following a </p><p>newspaper editorial scandal.  The scandal apparently served </p><p>as a convenient catalyst for a long-awaited dismissal by the </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Victor Meza, a former unofficial advisor to former </p><p>President Flores, has also received mention as a possible </p><p>candidate.  Meza studied in the Soviet Union at Patrice </p><p>Lumumba University in Moscow from 1965-1968 and is a former </p><p>member of the Communist Party.  Due to his leftist ties, Meza </p><p>was off limits to embassy employees during the 1980\'s.  He </p><p>has since become a contact of the Embassy.  Meza was an </p><p>advocate of diminished power for the Honduran Armed Forces </p><p>during the 1990\'s; he believed that the military\'s power </p><p>undermined the country\'s democratic development.  Meza also </p><p>served as a valuable source of information for the embassy on </p><p>human rights and other issues.  He is seen by many observers </p><p>as a very capable political analyst with good insights into </p><p>the political scene in Honduras.  He currently heads the </p><p>Honduran Documentation Center (CEDOH), and is a leader of the </p><p>NGO Citizens Forum.   Meza speaks Russian but no English.  He </p><p>has not received any official notice of his candidacy for the </p><p>ambassadorship, though he has told the Embassy he has heard </p><p>numerous rumors that he may be called upon for the position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT:  Ambassador urged President Ricardo Maduro on </p><p>March 28 to further delay the naming of an ambassador in the </p><p>wake of Fidel Castro\'s recent crackdown on human </p><p>rights/democracy advocates (ref A).  END COMMENT. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
