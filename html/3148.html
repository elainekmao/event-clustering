<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERIM LAWMAKING WRAPS UP AS LIKELIHOOD OF </p><p>ELECTIONS INCREASES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2529 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASON 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Jordan\'s Constitution allows the Cabinet to pass </p><p>provisional laws when Parliament is not in session, so long </p><p>as the laws are sufficiently "necessary."  The GOJ has </p><p>promulgated some ninety-nine provisional laws in the year </p><p>since Jordan\'s Parliament was dissolved on June 16, 2001. </p><p>But provisional lawmaking apparently will soon cease. </p><p>Abatement in regional tensions over the past several weeks </p><p>has encouraged the view among Embassy contacts that a date </p><p>for elections reinstating Jordan\'s Parliament will be </p><p>announced in July, with elections following as early as </p><p>September.  Given this possibility, Prime Ministry officials </p><p>set an internal end-of-June deadline for preparing twelve </p><p>more laws for Cabinet ratification.  The deadline aims at </p><p>avoiding the appearance of an executive usurpation of </p><p>legislative power in anticipation of a new Parliament, </p><p>although some critics accuse the GOJ of having already </p><p>overstepped its legal bounds in the course of its lawmaking </p><p>activities over the last year.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN\'S LAW OF LAWMAKING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Legislation normally originates with ministries </p><p>interested in passing it.  An interested ministry forwards </p><p>draft legislation to the Council of Ministers (equivalent of </p><p>the Cabinet in the U.S.) for initial discussion.  The Council </p><p>of Ministers revises legislation as appropriate and forwards </p><p>it to the Legislative Office of the Prime Ministry, which has </p><p>primary responsibility for putting draft laws into final </p><p>form.  The Legislative Office studies proposed legislation, </p><p>reviews it for conflicts with other laws, makes further </p><p>revisions, and sends it back to the Council of Ministers for </p><p>approval.  The Prime Minister refers legislation approved by </p><p>the Council of Ministers to the Chamber of Deputies, which </p><p>has the power to accept, amend, or reject it, and the Chamber </p><p>of Deputies forwards the legislation to the Senate. </p><p>Legislation passed by both houses of Parliament goes to the </p><p>King, who has the prerogative to ratify and promulgate it </p><p>through publication in the Official Gazette. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) An abbreviated lawmaking process applies when all or </p><p>part of the National Assembly is dissolved, as it now is. </p><p>Legislation still passes through various drafting stages at </p><p>the originating ministry, the Council of Ministers, and the </p><p>Legislative Office of the Prime Ministry.  But the Council of </p><p>Ministers can issue provisional laws with the King\'s approval </p><p>in the absence of a functioning parliament, so long as they </p><p>are limited to "matters which require necessary measures </p><p>which admit of no delay or which necessitate expenditures </p><p>incapable of postponement."  Provisional laws have the same </p><p>force as regularly enacted laws.  However, once back in </p><p>session, the National Assembly can approve, amend, or reject </p><p>laws promulgated in its absence.  Embassy contacts predict </p><p>Parliament will only amend a handful of the laws enacted </p><p>during the period of its dissolution.  One notable exception </p><p>will likely be the July 2001 provisional law regulating the </p><p>way parliamentarians themselves are elected.  Sources say </p><p>this law will be scrutinized very closely. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>LAWMAKING SANS PARLIAMENT DURING THE PAST YEAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the year since Parliament was dissolved, the GOJ </p><p>has promulgated ninety-nine provisional laws covering a wide </p><p>range of topics (e.g., inter alia, education, labor, state </p><p>security, traffic).  Several weeks ago, we reported that </p><p>regional tensions were casting doubt on the likelihood that </p><p>parliamentary elections would be held this fall (reftel), and </p><p>it appeared that the GOJ might continue enacting provisional </p><p>legislation in the absence of Parliament.  But tensions have </p><p>decreased since our last report, and the announcement of </p><p>impending elections on the West Bank has placed added </p><p>pressure on the GOJ to hold elections.  There is now a </p><p>consensus among Embassy contacts that a date for elections </p><p>will be announced in July.  One source at the Prime Ministry </p><p>has said, more specifically, that a date for holding </p><p>elections will be announced during the first ten days of </p><p>July.  Contacts vary in their predictions as to exactly when </p><p>elections will go forward; some say elections will be held as </p><p>early as September while others say they will take place </p><p>later on in the year. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Given the likelihood that a date for Parliamentary </p><p>elections will be annouced soon, the Prime Ministry has set </p><p>an end-of-June deadline by which laws must be prepared for </p><p>ratification, or be pushed off for action by the new </p><p>Parliament.  Jordan\'s Constitution would permit promulgation </p><p>of provisional laws after an elections announcement, right up </p><p>until the time when a new Parliament is constituted. </p><p>However, Minister of Trade and Industry Salah Bashir says </p><p>government officials are anxious to avoid the unseemly optics </p><p>that would be associated with an executive effort to </p><p>promulgate laws after elections are announced. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Legislative Office officials are optimistic that their </p><p>internal deadline permits enough time to enact a final set of </p><p>twelve provisional laws in advance of an announcement </p><p>concerning elections.  The Office is hurriedly working on </p><p>this final group of laws.  The Legislative Office has tabled </p><p>other laws now caught in the process of being drafted; work </p><p>on these laws will resume once a new Parliament is in </p><p>session. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In terms of raw numbers, GOJ lawmaking activities </p><p>during the past year represent only a modest increase over </p><p>the number of laws enacted during the last year Parliament </p><p>was in session.  Moreover, the passage of new laws has </p><p>continued at a fairly even pace over the past year.  Contacts </p><p>within the GOJ justify the government\'s lawmaking activities </p><p>over the past year on grounds that the Constitution permits </p><p>enactment of laws necessary to the normal functioning of </p><p>government, even in the absence of Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) But others claim the GOJ has taken advantage of </p><p>Parliament\'s absence to push through major and even </p><p>controversial economic reform laws aimed at promoting foreign </p><p>and local investment.  These laws include a </p><p>telecommunications restructuring law, a bankruptcy law, a new </p><p>companies law, a revised penal law criminalizing support for </p><p>terrorism, and revised labor and intellectual property rights </p><p>laws.  In addition, the final group of twelve laws now being </p><p>vetted includes other pieces of important economic </p><p>legislation, such as a revised securities law, a revised </p><p>properties law, and a law allowing the creation of credit </p><p>bureaus. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Several former parliamentarians also criticize the </p><p>regime more broadly, for promulgating scores of laws without </p><p>Parliament.  They view the Constitutional power to enact </p><p>legislation without Parliament as limited and extraordinary, </p><p>and argue that it should be used very sparingly and only when </p><p>necessary to avoid crisis.  These same contacts rail against </p><p>the decision to dissolve Parliament a year ago, and assert </p><p>that enacting laws absent Parliament undermines respect for </p><p>the rule of law and the legitimacy of laws so enacted. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The modest increase in the number of laws promulgated </p><p>during the past year does not in itself suggest an </p><p>indiscriminate rush to circumvent Parliament by passing laws </p><p>in its absence.  Moreover, a perceived need to carry on the </p><p>regular functions of government during a busy period when no </p><p>Parliament has been sitting could explain the passage of many </p><p>laws promulgated during the last year.  On the other hand, </p><p>some key legal changes wrought over the past year would have </p><p>been controversial and could have been significantly delayed </p><p>if Parliament\'s approval had been required. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
