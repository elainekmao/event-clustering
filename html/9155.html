<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR P, E, EUR, EB AND INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EU, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI, THE ITALIAN JUDICIARY AND EUROPEAN </p><p>OPINION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL M/C Tom Countryman, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: On the cusp of Italy\'s EU presidency, the </p><p>Berlusconi government\'s agenda has been eclipsed publicly by </p><p>the Prime Minister\'s renewed rhetorical assaults on the </p><p>Italian judiciary (septel addresses the furor caused by </p><p>Berlusconi\'s offensive outburst in the European Parliament </p><p>July 2).  Judged strictly by media coverage, it would appear </p><p>to be anything but a fair fight.  The reality is much more </p><p>complex: Italy\'s judiciary is a politicized, corporatist </p><p>institution concerned first and foremost with </p><p>self-preservation and only secondarily with improved </p><p>administration of justice.  It also includes a collection of </p><p>left-leaning magistrates who are exploiting their </p><p>independence to pursue overtly political objectives, </p><p>including taking down the prime minister.   In Berlusconi, </p><p>the judiciary has cultivated its most tenacious  adversary. </p><p>Overheated commentary belies a murkier truth: the Italian </p><p>judiciary is determined to defend its enormous, largely </p><p>hidden power from a prime minister whose rhetorical assaults </p><p>tap popular frustration with an inefficient judicial system </p><p>largely removed from public life. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Pick up any European newspaper these days, and one is </p><p>likely to see at least one article lamenting Italian PM </p><p>Berlusconi\'s turn at the helm of the European Union. </p><p>Berlusconi the media magnate injects an unpredictable element </p><p>into august EU deliberations and diplomacy, we are cautioned. </p><p> His disrespect for established institutions and conventions </p><p>is dangerous.  As evidence, commentators cite the sheaf of </p><p>legal proceedings against Berlusconi on bribery and other </p><p>charges, his rhetorical assaults on Italy\'s judiciary and new </p><p>legislation affording Italy\'s highest public officials </p><p>limited immunity while in office (which restores protections </p><p>some of these officials enjoyed prior to the early-90\'s </p><p>corruption scandals and is similar to the immunity enjoyed by </p><p>leaders of most EU members). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Much of the commentary strikes us as intra-EU </p><p>one-upmanship, given the number of Berlusconi\'s EU colleagues </p><p>who would join him in the dock on similar charges absent </p><p>their national immunity provisions.  But we find the </p><p>depiction of a Berlusconi bent on blowing up an established </p><p>institution surprisingly unsophisticated in its analysis of </p><p>Italian politics.  Casual observers might conclude that </p><p>Berlusconi\'s outright control of, or influence over, much of </p><p>Italy\'s media make this battle of wills with the magistrates </p><p>something less than a fair fight.  But the Italian judiciary </p><p>wields some powerful weapons of its own in defending its </p><p>position and power: </p><p> </p><p>-- constitutional protection mandating its independence and </p><p>self-administration; </p><p> </p><p>-- a constitutional provision directing the judiciary to </p><p>investigate all crimes or reports of offenses that in </p><p>practice provides prosecuting magistrates the latitude and </p><p>flexibility to set their own priorities -- to investigate </p><p>whomever they wish, for however long they wish. The </p><p>judiciary, not the government, decides which cases to </p><p>prosecute and, largely, to investigate. </p><p> </p><p>-- an appellate process that allows either prosecution or </p><p>defense to appeal verdicts and sentences, leading to frequent </p><p>retrial of cases, often with additional evidence. </p><p>4. (C) While we certainly don\'t agree with all of </p><p>Berlusconi\'s domestic commentary, he\'s objectively right on </p><p>two points: that Italy\'s judiciary is a closed system </p><p>shielded from oversight by either government or voters; and </p><p>that some of its members are exploiting their </p><p>constitutionally protected position to pursue a political </p><p>agenda. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Italy\'s judiciary is an insular, self-regulated and </p><p>self-governing entity.  It is a career service where </p><p>advancement comes largely through longevity and patronage of </p><p>more senior colleagues.  The judiciary takes funding from the </p><p>national government via annual budget allocations, but not </p><p>much else.  Certainly not advice.  But this insular, </p><p>corporatist mindset has not replaced political orientations; </p><p>far from it.  Most magistrates have strong political views, </p><p>gravitating toward either left or right, even if they eschew </p><p>conventional politics.  And some see it as their business </p><p>(their constitutional duty, even) to steer the course of </p><p>Italian democracy through judicial activism: through their </p><p>choices about which case they will investigate and try.  The </p><p>largest bloc on the judiciary\'s self-governing board </p><p>(positions for which magistrates run on virtual party </p><p>tickets) hails from the philosophical grouping in which this </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>vision of judicial activism finds currency. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) What does all this add up to?  A judicial system that </p><p>is insular, inflexible, inured to criticism and unchecked by </p><p>government or public oversight.  Does Berlusconi\'s criticism </p><p>of the judiciary ring true?  Many observers think at least </p><p>some of his charges do, notably the European Court of Human </p><p>Rights.  Italy accounted for over half the ECHR\'s rulings </p><p>overturning verdicts in 2001, mostly for exceeding statutes </p><p>of limitations for ponderously slow trials.  So do an </p><p>increasing number of Italians, according to recent polling in </p><p>which only a third of respondents said they trusted the </p><p>judiciary. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Berlusconi\'s overwrought attacks on the judiciary, as </p><p>well as some of the government\'s legislative proposals, are </p><p>self-serving and politically-motivated -- but so are the </p><p>actions and decisions of many magistrates.  Some left-leaning </p><p>magistrates openly characterize the judiciary as an overtly </p><p>political institution, one whose responsibilities include </p><p>restraining those in power.  Berlusconi\'s criticism taps into </p><p>a wider disaffection among many average Italians over the </p><p>judicial system\'s inadequacies.  Many Italians believe </p><p>magistrates pursue high-profile cases to the exclusion of the </p><p>sorts of bread-and-butter prosecutions that affect people\'s </p><p>daily lives.  Former PM Andreotti, considered a "good </p><p>Catholic" and good man by most Italians, was convicted last </p><p>November, at age 83, of conspiring to commit murder to </p><p>protect alleged kickback arrangements; the alleged murderers </p><p>were acquitted for lack of evidence.  Andreotti had </p><p>previously been both convicted and acquitted of the charges </p><p>in investigations and trials stretching back to 1993. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Last year, the government proposed a reform package to </p><p>improve judicial performance and efficiency, notably by </p><p>restricting the revolving door between prosecuting and </p><p>judging cases, requiring more in-service training, tying </p><p>advancement more directly to performance and giving </p><p>parliament a role in prioritizing cases to be pursued.  The </p><p>magistrates\'  reply was to label the package -- or any </p><p>reforms proposed by government or parliament -- as an </p><p>intolerable assault on judicial independence and, by </p><p>extension, an attack on the constitution itself.  Then they </p><p>staged a one-day strike. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Berlusconi attracts criticism, both within and outside </p><p>Italy, as much for what he is -- an outsider -- as for what </p><p>he says and does.  It strikes us that it\'s Berlusconi\'s </p><p>penchant for criticizing establishment institutions, whether </p><p>Italian courts or European councils, that so annoys and </p><p>angers European commentators.  Scratch the surface of angry </p><p>reaction to any of his critiques, and one usually finds a </p><p>smugness justified largely by Berlusconi\'s endless legal </p><p>scuffles.  The critics may have a point -- Berlusconi </p><p>ultimately may be ill-suited to the patient </p><p>consensus-building required in the Presidency, as his </p><p>offensive remarks in the European parliament suggest.  But </p><p>basing such an assessment on his legal marathon misses the </p><p>context and skews the analysis.  There\'s a big difference </p><p>between a set of magistrates in Milan and the other leaders </p><p>of EU member-states. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03029 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
