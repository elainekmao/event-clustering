THEY </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE UN SAFE AREA POLICY WAS GROSSLY </p><p>INADEQUATE IN THE CASE OF BIHAC, WHERE ONLY THE TOWN WAS </p><p>PROTECTED, BUT THE ENTIRE POCKET WAS IN RANGE OF SERB </p><p>GUNS.  THEY NOTED THAT THE POWER STATION AND WATER </p><p>TREATMENT PLANT ARE BOTH OUTSIDE OF THE SAFE AREA AND WERE </p><p>FREQUENTLY TARGETED </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BOTH STRESSED THAT IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO TO </p><p>MANAGE THE VARIOUS FLOWS OF DISPLACED PERSONS IN THE </p><p>CANTON THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE </p><p>LAST FOUR YEAR.  THE SMALL SIZE OF THE BIHAC POCKET MEANT </p><p>THAT ANY TIME SHELLING STARTED, LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE </p><p>WOULD FLEE, USUALLY TO BIHAC TOWN, SEVERELY TAXING LIMITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03082  01 OF 04  121603Z </p><p>SERVICES AND SUPPLIES.  THEY ESTIMATED THAT 20 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE AREA\'S POPULATION FLED FROM ABDIC CONTROLLED TERRITORY </p><p>TOWARD THE SOUTH.  ABDIC\'S "REPUBLIC OF WESTERN BOSNIA" </p><p>ALSO CONTAINED ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THE AVAILABLE FARM </p><p>LAND.  AS A RESULT, LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE FORCED TO FEED </p><p>MORE PEOPLE FROM LESS LAND.  THIS PROBLEM, COUPLED WITH </p><p>THE INABILITY OF AID CONVOYS TO REACH THE POCKET, HAS </p><p>CREATED A CONTINUING PROBLEM FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS TRYING TO </p><p>SUSTAIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

THE UN WOULD LIKE GOBH </p><p>OFFICIALS, POSSIBLY AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, TO TALK TO </p><p>THE REFUGEES AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME BACK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) WE HEARD FROM BOTH THE UN AND CANTON OFFICIALS </p><p>THAT A DEAL FOR RETURNING THE ABDIC REFUGEES TO VELIKA </p><p>KLADUSA HAD BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOC, GOBH, ABDIC, AND </p><p>REFUGEE REPRESENTATIVES, EFFECTIVE AUGUST 11.  IN AN </p><p>ASIDE, GOBH OFFICIALS OPINED THAT ABDIC MUST BE IN CROATIA </p><p>IF HE HAD SIGNED THE AGREEMENT.

BIHAC SAFE AREA WAS SHELLED REGULARLY, </p><p>RECEIVING 6 SHELLS LATE ON AUGUST 9.   THE GOVERNOR </p><p>OUTLINED A LONG WISH LIST OF ITEMS THAT THE AREA </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDED. HE WAS CRITICAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S LACK OF IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.
