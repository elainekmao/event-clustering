<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EU, MD, RS, CA, PREL, PBTS, CVIS, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA JOINS U.S., EU SANCTIONS AGAINST </p><p>TRANSNISTRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 52179 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On 27 February Political Counselor discussed the </p><p>proposed visa sanctions against Transnistrian officials with </p><p>John McNiesh, Eastern European Desk Officer for the Canadian </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) McNeish said that representatives of the U.S. and </p><p>Canadian OSCE Missions in Vienna had already discussed the </p><p>imposition of visa sanctions.  Canada was fully on board and </p><p>had entered Igor Smirnov\'s name into their visa lookout </p><p>system.  He noted that there were unconfirmed rumors that </p><p>Smirnov was also in possession of a Canadian passport.  This </p><p>was being looked into and his name was entered into their </p><p>border look-out data base, so he would be stopped in either </p><p>case.  If we were aware of other aliases, spellings, or </p><p>permutations of his name, Canada would take action on this </p><p>information as well. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
