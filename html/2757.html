(SBU) SUMMARY.  THE GOI CONTINUES TO SPEAK WITH RESTRAINT </p><p>ABOUT USG STEEL SAFEGUARDS -- DEFENDING LIMITED EU RESPONSIVE </p><p>SAFEGUARDS AND LOOKING TO BRUSSELS FOR A LEGAL OPINION ON THE </p><p>WTO-CONSISTENCY OF RETALIATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME CALLING </p><p>FOR AVOIDANCE OF A PROTECTIONIST SPIRAL AND FOREGOING </p><p>STRIDENT RHETORIC.  ITALIAN INDUSTRY IS WATCHFUL BUT IS NOT </p><p>PUSHING THE GOI TO ACT.  THE PRESS DOESN\'T TREAT STEEL AS A </p><p>MAJOR STORY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ITALIAN DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE ADOLFO </p><p>URSO SET THE TONE OF GOI REACTION TO USG STEEL SAFEGUARDS </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTATION WHEN HE SAID THE EUROPEAN </p><p>STEEL GLUT HAD BEEN CAUSED IN GOOD MEASURE BY THE "INDULGENT" </p><p>EU MARKET ACCESS CONCESSIONS EXTENDED TO EU CANDIDATE STATES. </p><p> IN APRIL 9 PRESS COMMENTS, URSO DEFENDED EU STEEL SAFEGUARDS </p><p>BUT CONTINUED TO URGE RESTRAINT, SAYING, "THE MEASURES </p><p>ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ARE NECESSARY, PRECISELY </p><p>TO FORCE THE UNITED STATES TO GO FOR THE POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>WE HAVE ALWAYS ADVOCATED AND PURSUED...BUT A PROTECTIONIST </p><p>SPIRAL MUST AT ALL COSTS BE PREVENTED (TO AVOID JEOPARDIZING) </p><p>THE NEGOTIATING ROUND SET IN MOTION IN DOHA AND THE MEASURES </p><p>TAKEN TO PROMOTE GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) GIVING DEFINITION TO URSO\'S DEFENSE OF THE EU </p><p>SAFEGUARDS, SANDRO FANELLA, COMMON COMMERCIAL POLICY OFFICE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01853  121621Z </p><p>DIRECTOR AT THE DEPUTY MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN TRADE, TOLD </p><p>ECONOFF ON APRIL 11 THAT THE SAFEGUARDS WOULD BE ACTIVATED </p><p>ONLY FOR CATEGORIES OF STEEL FOR WHICH IMPORTS INCREASE IN </p><p>2002 TO LEVELS HIGHER THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE 1999-2001 </p><p>YEARLY AVERAGE.  DEFLECTING REFTEL\'S CRITICISM OF EU </p><p>SAFEGUARDS AS UNSUPPORTED BY AN INJURY DETERMINATION OR </p><p>IMPORT SURGE, FANELLA EXPLAINED THAT THE EU MEASURES HAD, IN </p><p>THIS MANNER, A BUILT-IN SURGE SENSOR.  ECONOFF REPLIED THAT </p><p>THE SYSTEM AS DESCRIBED NEVERTHELESS APPEARS TO PRESUME </p><p>INJURY RATHER THAN ADJUDICATING THE QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FANELLA WAS LESS EXPANSIVE ON POSSIBLE EU </p><p>RETALIATION, SAYING HE IS AWAITING THE EU LEGAL OPINION OF </p><p>THE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT.  HE SAID HIS MINISTRY IS NOT </p><p>SEPARATELY STUDYING THE AGREEMENT ON THE ARTICLES 8.2 AND 8.3 </p><p>ISSUE.  MORE GENERALLY, HE ALLEGED THAT THE USG "STARTED ALL </p><p>THIS" WITH UNILATERAL ACTION AND, IN HIS VIEW, IS NOT </p><p>WELL-POSITIONED TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT COUNTERACTIONS.  TO </p><p>ECONOFF\'S REFTEL DEFENSE OF USG SAFEGUARDS AS SUPPORTED BY </p><p>THE FINDINGS OF A NINE-MONTH ADJUDICATION, FANELLA SCOFFED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. FINDINGS ON INJURY WERE "IMAGINATIVE." </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) FANELLA SAID HIS MINISTRY HAS NOT BEEN BESIEGED BY </p><p>ITALIAN INDUSTRY ABOUT THE U.S. SAFEGUARDS.  INDUSTRY, HE </p><p>SAID, IS LOOKING CLOSELY FOR ANY SIGN OF A STEEL IMPORT SURGE </p><p>REFLECTING DIVERSION OF STEEL FROM THE U.S. MARKET BUT IS NOT </p><p>PUSHING THE GOI TO ADVOCATE RETALIATION WITHIN THE EU. </p><p>ECONOFF REPEATED REFTEL DEMARCHE AT THE MFA AND AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES (NOW THE PARENT MINISTRY TO </p><p>THE DEPUTY MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN TRADE) WHERE GOI OFFICIALS </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT INDUSTRY IS WATCHING BUT NOT LOBBYING FOR A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01853  121621Z </p><p>PARTICULAR GOI COURSE.  THE ITALIAN PRESS CARRIES U.S. AND EU </p><p>STEEL DEVELOPMENTS, BUT THE STORY IS NOW USUALLY RELEGATED TO </p><p>INTERIOR PAGES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01853 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
