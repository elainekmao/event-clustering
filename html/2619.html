<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 HANOI 000589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO, INR, EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/RSP, L/UNA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SOCI, EAID, ECON, VM, UN, HUMANR, APEC, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S INCREASING ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>--       AND MULTILATERAL COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  VIETNAM HAS MOVED STEADILY TO INCREASE </p><p>ITS PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL AND MULTILATERAL FORA </p><p>SINCE THE COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) DIRECTED THE GVN TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT A MORE OUTWARD ORIENTED FOREIGN POLICY AT THE </p><p>SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS IN 1991.  TODAY, VIETNAM HAS </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN 62 GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GVN </p><p>LEADERSHIP VIEWS THIS PARTICIPATION AS A MEANS TO ADVANCE </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND TO DIVERSIFY </p><p>THE FOCI OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY. )  THIS PARTICIPATION WILL </p><p>LIKELY ENHANCE VIETNAM\'S UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>NORMS AND VALUES, AND ADD MOMENTUM BOTH TO THE EVOLUTION OF </p><p>A MORE PROFESSIONAL -- RATHER THAN IDEOLOGICAL -- BODY OF </p><p>OFFICIALS AS WELL AS TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY WITHIN VIETNAM.  A LACK OF MATERIAL AND HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES, INCLUDING GOOD ENGLISH SPEAKERS, HAS LIMITED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S PARTICIPATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE PARTY ESTABLISHES THE POLICY FRAMEWORK </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00589  01 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>2.  (U)  DURING THE SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS IN 1991, </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERSHIP DECLARED THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO </p><p>EXPAND ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.  AS STATED IN THE </p><p>CONGRESS\' POLITICAL REPORT, THE CPV LEADERSHIP WAS </p><p>DETERMINED HENCEFORTH TO EMBARK ON A MORE OUTWARD FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY, DECLARING IT WOULD COOPERATE WITH ALL COUNTRIES ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF "EQUALITY AND MUTUAL BENEFITS, REGARDLESS OF </p><p>DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REGIMES."  THE REPORT FURTHER </p><p>STATED THAT VIETNAM WOULD STRIVE "TO BE FRIENDS WITH ALL </p><p>COUNTRIES. . ." AND AFFIRMED VIETNAM\'S SUPPORT FOR THE UN </p><p>MORE DEFINITIVELY THAN HAD THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS.  IT </p><p>PLEDGED THAT VIETNAM WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE UN AND </p><p>COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, UN SPECIALIZED </p><p>AGENCIES, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGO). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THIS POLICY MARKED A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE </p><p>SIXTH PARTY CONGRESS OF 1986, WHICH ONLY REFERRED TO </p><p>PROMOTING RELATIONSHIPS AND COOPERATION WITH SPECIFIC </p><p>COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE SOVIET UNION AND A FEW OTHER </p><p>"TRADITIONAL FRIENDS."  (NOTE:  THE TERM "TRADITIONAL" IN </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE CONTEXT REFERS TO COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY </p><p>SOCIALIST, WITH WHICH VIETNAM HAD LONG-STANDING </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS THE THEN-USSR, LAOS, IRAQ, AND THE </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE BLOC.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DZUNG REAFFIRMED </p><p>IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT VIETNAM WOULD PURSUE A POLICY OF </p><p>"MULTILATERALIZATION."  LAST NOVEMBER, FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>NGUYEN DY NIEN ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR VIETNAM TO </p><p>PROMOTE A "DIVERSE" FOREIGN POLICY AND TO INCREASE ITS ROLE </p><p>IN THE "INTERNATIONAL ARENA."  HE PLEDGED THAT VIETNAM WOULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00589  01 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>CONTINUE TO HOST "IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES" AND </p><p>STRIVE TOWARD WTO ACCESSION.  HE NOTED THAT, DURING 2001, </p><p>VIETNAM HAD ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN "MANY" UN AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\' ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PHAM QUANG VINH, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>DEPARTMENT (MFA/IO), TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS SPARKED THIS </p><p>SEMINAL CHANGE:  (1) THE END OF VIETNAM\'S INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>CAMBODIA RESULTED IN THE LIFTING OF REGIONAL AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS AND LED TO MORE NORMAL RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN VIETNAM AND OTHER NATIONS;  (2) THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>DISSOLVED BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESSES, </p><p>CHANGING THE DYNAMIC OF VIETNAM\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  WITH THE </p><p>FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION, VIETNAM COULD NO LONGER BENEFIT </p><p>FROM ANY CLIENT STATUS.  THESE FACTORS, COMBINED WITH THE </p><p>"DOI MOI" (ECONOMIC RENOVATION) POLICY ADOPTED IN 1986, </p><p>INFLUENCED VIETNAM TO MOVE FROM A "RELATIVELY ISOLATED </p><p>PERSPECTIVE TO ONE THAT WAS MORE OUTWARD LOOKING," VINH </p><p>CONCLUDED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT, AS VIETNAM EXTENDED ITS </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS, THIS "LED TO A CORRESPONDING INCREASE </p><p>IN MULTILATERAL PARTICIPATION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  TRAN TRONG GIAP, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF ASIA, AFRICA, AND LATIN AMERICA OF THE VIETNAM UNION OF </p><p>FRIENDSHIP ORGANIZATIONS, STATED SEPARATELY THAT THE SEVENTH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS "CORRECTLY REACTED TO THE CHANGING WORLD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO3916 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00589  02 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AIT-03   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /022W </p><p>                  ------------------7463E3  141021Z /38 </p><p>R 140954Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5790 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0670 </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00589  02 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 06 HANOI 000589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO, INR, EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/RSP, L/UNA </p><p> </p><p>ENVIRONMENT."  HE NOTED THAT ONCE THE CPV SET THE POLICY, </p><p>STATE DIPLOMACY HAS "DONE ITS BEST" TO IMPLEMENT IT.  DR. LE </p><p>THI QUE, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT THE </p><p>VIETNAM NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, NOTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WAS "VERY IMPORTANT" AS A WAY </p><p>FOR VIETNAM TO MAKE ITS VOICE HEARD.  "IN THE ERA OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION, NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO BE ISOLATED," HE </p><p>STRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  WORLD BANK SENIOR ECONOMIST PHAM MINH DUC NOTED </p><p>THAT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, AS VIETNAM HAD BECOME MORE OPEN </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY, IT HAD BECOME MUCH MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN REACHING OUT TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>DUC SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN A CHANGE IN THE GVN\'S PERCEPTION </p><p>OF THE WORLD BANK FROM A STRICTLY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO </p><p>ONE THAT ALSO PROVIDES ADVICE AND COORDINATES PROJECTS.  THE </p><p>GVN NOW VIEWS THE WORLD BANK MORE AS A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER </p><p>AND LESS AS JUST A FINANCIER, DUC CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>KEY MILESTONES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00589  02 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>8.  (U)  NGO QUANG XUAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE MFA\'S </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION, EMPHASIZED </p><p>SEVERAL KEY MILESTONES OF THE EARLY AND MID-1990S THAT </p><p>INFLUENCED VIETNAM\'S INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS:  (1) VIETNAM\'S </p><p>JOINING ASEAN; (2) MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC </p><p>AND SOCIAL COUNCIL (ECOSOC); (3) A FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU); AND, (4) DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION </p><p>WITH THE UNITED STATES.  ACCORDING TO XUAN, THESE EVENTS </p><p>PUSHED VIETNAM (BACK) INTO THE INTERNATIONAL MAINSTREAM AND </p><p>ENABLED THE COUNTRY TO EXPAND ITS PARTICIPATION IN "KEY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS."  DURING THIS PERIOD, VIETNAM </p><p>ALSO SERVED AS VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY\'S </p><p>52ND SESSION.  "SUCH ACTIVITY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE </p><p>WITHOUT THE SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS POLICY CHANGES," </p><p>CONCLUDED XUAN.  COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF THE "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" NEWSPAPER, </p><p>SUGGESTED SEPARATELY THAT JOINING THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION (APEC) FORUM IN 1998 WAS ANOTHER IMPORTANT EVENT </p><p>THAT INCREASED VIETNAM\'S PROFILE IN A MULTILATERAL FORUM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THE MFA/IO\'S VINH ADDED THAT VIETNAM\'S ELECTION TO </p><p>THE UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) GOVERNING BOARD IN 1998 </p><p>WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT, DUE TO THE LEADING ROLE UNDP PLAYS IN </p><p>THE MULTILATERAL COMMUNITY IN VIETNAM.  HE ALSO NOTED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF VIETNAM\'S ELECTION TO THE UNICEF EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCIL IN 1996, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE UNICEF\'S PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>IMPORTANT TO THE GVN\'S OVERALL SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS. </p><p>DISCUSSING THE GVN\'S LONG-RANGE GOAL IN THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>SYSTEM, VINH SAID THAT THE GVN WILL TRY FOR ELECTION TO THE </p><p>UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN 2007.  HOWEVER, THIS WILL BE "VERY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00589  02 OF 06  141020Z </p><p>COMPLICATED AND REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK AND PREPARATION," HE </p><p>ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  ACCORDING TO DR. NGUYEN THIET SON, DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>CENTRE FOR NORTH AMERICA STUDIES, DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION </p><p>WITH THE U.S. IN 1995 GAVE GVN AND CPV LEADERSHIP MORE </p><p>CONFIDENCE THAT VIETNAM COULD ASSUME A LARGER MULTILATERAL </p><p>ROLE.  COLONEL NHUNG STATED SEPARATELY THAT WHILE THE U.S. </p><p>AND VIETNAM CONTINUE TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS OVER VARIOUS </p><p>ISSUES, ESPECIALLY HUMAN RIGHTS, THE TWO COUNTRIES COOPERATE </p><p>WELL IN A NUMBER OF AREAS.  AS THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE U.S. HAS INCREASED, SO HAS VIETNAM\'S INTEREST IN WORKING </p><p>WITH INTERNATIONAL AND MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS, HE </p><p>OBSERVED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ASEAN: REGIONAL STAGE WITH A BILATERAL TWIST </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  VIETNAM JOINED ASEAN IN JULY 1995 AS ITS SEVENTH </p><p>MEMBER.  ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR CARLYLE THAYER OF THE ASIA </p><p>PACIFIC CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES, VIETNAM MOVED RAPIDLY </p><p>TO NORMALIZE ITS REGIONAL RELATIONS AFTER THE CAMBODIA ISSUE </p><p>WAS RESOLVED, GIVING PRIORITY TO RELATIONS WITH ASEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES AND WITH CHINA.  MEMBERSHIP IN ASEAN ENHANCED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S DIPLOMATIC STANDING AND CREATED FAVORABLE </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THAYER CONTINUED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO3919 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00589  03 OF 06  141021Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AIT-03   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /022W </p><p>                  ------------------7463F4  141021Z /38 </p><p>R 140954Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5791 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0671 </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00589  03 OF 06  141021Z </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 06 HANOI 000589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO, INR, EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/RSP, L/UNA </p><p> </p><p>THAYER ALSO NOTED THAT POLICY MAKERS IN VIETNAM VIEWED </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN ASEAN AS PROVIDING SOME "COVER" FOR CERTAIN </p><p>ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE WEST, SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION.  COLONEL NHUNG OF "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" NOTED </p><p>THAT ASEAN HAD ALSO BEEN AN "IMPORTANT FORUM" FOR VIETNAM TO </p><p>ADDRESS REGIONAL SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  HE </p><p>POINTED TO THE FEBRUARY 2002 ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS\' </p><p>MEETING IN PHUKET, WHICH HAD RATIFIED A PLAN TO ASSIST </p><p>VIETNAM, LAOS, BURMA, AND CAMBODIA (THE FOUR NEWEST AND </p><p>LEAST DEVELOPED ASEAN MEMBERS) TO CLOSE THE "DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GAP" BETWEEN THEM AND OTHER ASEAN NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  LE LINH LAN, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR EUROPEAN </p><p>AND AMERICAN STUDIES AT THE MFA\'S INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS (IIR), ALSO NOTED THE POSITIVE SECURITY IMPACT OF </p><p>ASEAN AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO VIETNAM.  LAN POINTED TO THE </p><p>34TH ASEAN MINISTERIAL MEETING IN HANOI LAST JULY, WHICH </p><p>REAFFIRMED THE HIGH COUNCIL\'S MANDATE TO FACILITATE THE </p><p>PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES THROUGH "REGIONAL </p><p>PROCESSES." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRAN DUC BINH </p><p>SAID THAT VIETNAM\'S INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IN ASEAN WAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00589  03 OF 06  141021Z </p><p>A "SOURCE OF PRIDE" TO THE GVN LEADERSHIP.  HE POINTED </p><p>ESPECIALLY TO THE SIXTH ASEAN SUMMIT, 34TH ASEAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS\' MEETING, AND 8TH ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM, ALL HELD </p><p>IN HANOI AND ORGANIZED BY VIETNAM AS THE ASEAN CHAIRMAN. </p><p>BINH SAID THAT VIETNAM WAS ALSO "VERY PLEASED" TO CO-CHAIR </p><p>THE U.S.-ASEAN DIALOGUE HELD IN WASHINGTON IN NOVEMBER 2001. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  VIETNAM\'S ASEAN PARTICIPATION HAS ALSO PROVIDED A </p><p>PLATFORM FOR INCREASING BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>REGION.  AT THE DECEMBER 2000 EU-ASEAN BILATERAL MEETINGS, </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN HELD TALKS WITH EU COUNTERPARTS FROM </p><p>FRANCE, ITALY, IRELAND, AND SPAIN IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>"ACCELERATE" ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN AREAS SUCH AS TRADE, </p><p>INVESTMENT, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  THIS TYPE OF </p><p>ACTIVITY IS IN LINE WITH THE GVN POLICY OF IMPROVING ITS </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AS MANY COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>APEC FILLS A NEED </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  VIETNAM BECAME A FULL APEC MEMBER IN 1998. </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG OF "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" DESCRIBED VIETNAM\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE ORGANIZATION AS "ACTIVE," ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.  IN MARCH 2002, VIETNAM HOSTED THE </p><p>25TH APEC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETING; IN APRIL 2001, VIETNAM HOSTED THE FIRST INDUSTRIAL </p><p>SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY WORKING GROUP.  AT THAT MEETING, </p><p>MINISTER OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENT CHU TUAN </p><p>NHA SAID THAT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THE GVN\'S </p><p>"TOP POLICY PRIORITIES."  AT THE EIGHTH APEC SUMMIT IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00589  03 OF 06  141021Z </p><p>NOVEMBER 2000, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY COOPERATION AMONG APEC </p><p>MEMBERS.  IN ADDITION, HE NOTED THAT APEC ACTIVITIES SHOULD </p><p>HELP PREPARE VIETNAM FOR ACCESSION TO THE WTO.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG, APEC IS A GOOD MATCH FOR VIETNAM\'S INTERESTS, </p><p>BECAUSE VIETNAM IS ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERTISE OF </p><p>MEMBERS WITH MORE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, SUCH AS THE U.S., </p><p>JAPAN, AND AUSTRALIA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>EU PROVIDES A MARKET, A WINDOW TO EUROPE, AND ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  ANOTHER IMPORTANT MULTILATERAL ACCOMPLISHMENT </p><p>DURING THE 1990S WAS THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT SIGNED BETWEEN </p><p>THE EU AND VIETNAM IN JULY 1995.  THIS AGREEMENT FOLLOWED </p><p>OTHER EU-GVN MILESTONES, INCLUDING (1) NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN NOVEMBER 1990; AND, (2) THE TEXTILE </p><p>AND CLOTHING AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN 1992 AND SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>AMENDED/RENEWED SEVERAL TIMES.

AT THE 9TH MEETING OF ECONOMIC </p><p>LEADERS OF APEC, HELD IN SHANGHAI IN OCTOBER 2001, VIETNAM </p><p>PUT FORTH AN INITIATIVE ON "TRAINING AND RETRAINING OF HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES TO ASSIST DEVELOPING MEMBERS TOWARD THE NEW </p><p>ECONOMY." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00589  05 OF 06  141021Z </p><p>27.

THIS PROBLEM IS LESS ACUTE NOW THAN A </p><p>FEW YEARS AGO BUT IT STILL WILL TAKE "SOME TIME" UNTIL IT IS </p><p>RESOLVED, CONCLUDED VINH.

HE EXPLAINED THAT VIETNAM "IS A POOR COUNTRY" AND </p><p>CANNOT AFFORD TO SET UP MISSIONS AND PARTICIPATE AS FULLY AS </p><p>THE GVN WOULD LIKE.
