<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, EUR/BI, AND S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, PREL, BH, HR, USUN, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY/CROATIA: GOTOVINA DISCUSSION CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1342 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN ZAGREB BELIEVE THAT CONDITIONS </p><p>MAY SOON BE CREATED WHEREBY ICTY PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA COULD </p><p>SURRENDER TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR FURTHER TRANSFER TO THE </p><p>HAGUE.  THE LOCAL ICTY REPRESENTATIVE TOLD US JUNE 18 THAT </p><p>RECENT MOVES TAKEN BY GOTOVINA HIMSELF AND PRESIDENT MESIC </p><p>COULD BE THE OPENING STEPS IN A SET-PIECE DRAMA WHERE THE </p><p>LAST ACT IS GOTOVINA\'S SURRENDER AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER TO </p><p>ICTY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>EXCHANGE OF LETTERS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JUNE 12, PRESIDENT MESIC SENT A LETTER TO ICTY </p><p>CHIEF PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE OFFERING TO GUARANTEE THE </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA IF ICTY WOULD BE WILLING </p><p>TO INTERVIEW HIM AS A "SUSPECT" IN ZAGREB RATHER THAN INSIST </p><p>ON HIS TRANSFER TO THE HAGUE.  ALSO ON JUNE 12, MESIC\'S </p><p>OFFICE TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD MADE NEW </p><p>DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO PM RACAN\'S CABINET THAT SHOW GOTOVINA </p><p>WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEANSING OF ETHNIC SERBS FROM </p><p>THE KRAJINA REGION OF CROATIA DURING "OPERATION STORM." </p><p>FRANE KRNIC, HEAD OF THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH </p><p>ICTY, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD LONG AGO MADE </p><p>THE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO ICTY. </p><p> </p><p>    3. (C) THOMAS OSARIO, HEAD OF THE ICTY OFFICE IN ZAGREB, </p><p>CONFIRMED TO US THAT THE SIX DOCUMENTS PROVIDED CONTAIN NO </p><p>NEW INFORMATION, BUT WERE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ARCHIVES, AND THEY CONTAINED BOTH </p><p>EXCULPATORY AND INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE.  ON JUNE 17 DEL PONTE </p><p>RESPONDED TO MESIC IN A DRY AND FACTUAL LETTER SHE WROTE </p><p>HERSELF IN WHICH SHE GAVE MESIC NO ROOM FOR POLITICAL </p><p>MANEUVERING.  SHE SAID WITHDRAWAL OF THE INDICTMENT IS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE, AND THE "ONLY SOLUTION" IS FOR GOTOVINA TO </p><p>SURRENDER VOLUNTARILY OR BE ARRESTED AND TRANSFERRED TO THE </p><p>HAGUE AND TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COURT.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>GRANIC ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOC WOULD RESPECT THE LAW OF THE </p><p>LAND; IF GOTOVINA PRESENTS HIMSELF, THE GOC WILL HAVE HIM </p><p>ARRESTED, EVEN IF THE ARREST TAKES PLACE AT PANTOVCAK </p><p>(MESIC\'S RESIDENCE). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MESIC\'S INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF GOTOVINA HAS GIVEN </p><p>HIM A POLITICAL BOOST, AND WAS A SOLID SWIPE AT THE HDZ\'S </p><p>FIRM GRASP ON THE POLITICAL RIGHT.  THE HDZ HAD USED </p><p>GOTOVINA, WIDELY ACCLAIMED AND ACCEPTED AS A WAR HERO, AS A </p><p>SYMBOL OF OPPOSITION TO COOPERATION WITH ICTY.  WHATEVER THE </p><p>REASONS -- PRESSURE FROM SFOR IN BOSNIA, INTENSIFIED ACTION </p><p>ON THE PART OF THE CROATIAN POLICE, OR THE ARREST OF RAJIC </p><p>AND THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS </p><p>HIDING AND WHO WAS ABETTING IT -- GOTOVINA HAS NOW DELINKED </p><p>HIS FUTURE FROM THE POLITICAL RIGHT AND HAS EFFECTIVELY </p><p>PLACED MESIC AT THE HELM OF HIS DEFENSE.  FOR THE PAST YEAR, </p><p>MESIC HAS BEEN CALLING FOR GOTOVINA TO TURN HIMSELF IN. </p><p>MESIC HAS POSITIONED HIMSELF WELL; BY PICKING UP THE MANTEL </p><p>ON GOTOVINA, HE UNDERCUTS THE MODERATE RIGHT BY PROCLAIMING </p><p>THAT THE HDZ MISUSED GOTOVINA, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN </p><p>    DEMONSTRATE COOPERATION WITH ICTY AND RESPECT FOR THE LAW. </p><p>THE PRESS IS SPECULATING THAT, IF HE SUCCEEDS, MESIC IS NOW </p><p>CERTAIN TO WIN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OSARIO TOLD US THE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS AND THE </p><p>PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL ARCHIVES </p><p>(DOCUMENTS FROM THE TUDJMAN ARCHIVES), DESPITE THE FACT THEY </p><p>CONTAIN NO NEW INFORMATION, REPRESENT A SEA CHANGE IN THE </p><p>CASE.  "WE HAVE GONE FROM A VACUUM TO NOW MOVEMENT," HE SAID, </p><p>NOTING THAT GOTOVINA\'S LAWYERS HAVE NEVER ONCE BEEN IN DIRECT </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE ICTY OFFICE.  THE DISCUSSION MAY NOW EVOLVE </p><p>THROUGH THE PRESS, BUT THE MODALITIES OF GOTOVINA\'S ARREST </p><p>AND TRANSFER ARE AT LEAST NOW BEING DISCUSSED.  OSARIO </p><p>DECLINED TO PREDICT WHEN GOTOVINA MIGHT SHOW UP IN THE HAGUE, </p><p>THOUGH HE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS "NO WAY BACK." </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
