<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003947 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LARRY MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, PINR, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQI BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN JORDAN MEETS CPA </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  FOR USG DISTRIBUTION ONLY. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  In a meeting with CPA advisors </p><p>visiting Jordan, a group of Amman-based Iraqi business </p><p>people said that they controlled substantial capital and </p><p>technical resources that they wanted to contribute to the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq.  In order to facilitate </p><p>communication with the authority in Iraq, they are </p><p>planning to form an association of expatriate Iraqi </p><p>investors.  Among the first things they would call for </p><p>was political risk cover for commercial investments in </p><p>Iraq, at least until new Iraqi commercial and legal </p><p>institutions are up and running.  Although we do not know </p><p>much about the background of the individual </p><p>businesspeople, it could be useful to keep up a dialogue </p><p>with them to see what they have to offer.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On June 24, following the World Economic Forum </p><p>meetings at the Dead Sea, a group of Jordan-based Iraqi </p><p>businesspeople met CPA economic advisors Reuben Jeffery </p><p>and Eric Otto at the Intercontinental Hotel in Amman. </p><p>Embassy Amman economic and commercial staff also sat in </p><p>on the meeting, which was facilitated by Jordanian </p><p>businessman Husam Deranieh.  The businessmen were Iraqis </p><p>who said they have been resident in Jordan for many years </p><p>but who retained business and personal interests in Iraq </p><p>and continued to do business there under the UN Oil for </p><p>Food Program and the bilateral Jordan-Iraq trade </p><p>protocol.  The businessmen said that they were interested </p><p>in working with CPA to become active in investing and </p><p>trading in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Difficulty Communicating </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The group\'s main concern was an inability to </p><p>establish clear lines of communication with CPA to </p><p>discuss investment and business opportunities.  For </p><p>example, they had variously tried to be in touch to offer </p><p>assistance in providing catering and duty-free services </p><p>at BIAP or to quickly set up a 50,000 line wireless </p><p>telecom network in the Basra area.  While their initial </p><p>email messages or phone calls were acknowledged, there </p><p>had been little to no follow-up from CPA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The Iraqis said that they had been more </p><p>successful in establishing working relationships with </p><p>local coalition military commanders on the ground.  This </p><p>had allowed them to start up some local activities that </p><p>affected Iraqi citizens\' lives on a small scale. </p><p>However, these businessmen said that they had the </p><p>financial capacity and know-how to operate on a national </p><p>scale.  They said they had represented U.S. companies, </p><p>had technical skills, large pools of potential employees, </p><p>as well as the connections necessary to guarantee </p><p>security (see bio information below). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>An Expatriate Iraqi Investors Association? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Jeffery described plans to establish a </p><p>business help center in Baghdad in the near future that </p><p>could serve as an initial point of contact.  The </p><p>businessmen said they were planning to organize </p><p>themselves as an association of expatriate Iraqi </p><p>businesspeople that could deal on members\' behalf with </p><p>CPA and Iraqi ministries.  They said business </p><p>associations in Iraq with which CPA appeared to be </p><p>already communicating (such as the Iraqi Businessmen\'s </p><p>Association) were tainted by association with the former </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The group also said that as expatriate Iraqis </p><p>resident in Jordan, they would be well-accepted by the </p><p>Iraqi people.  They said that CPA appeared to be dealing </p><p>with Kuwaiti and Gulf businesspeople, which most Iraqis </p><p>would find offensive.  For instance, the businessman who </p><p>said he had offered to set up a mobile phone network in </p><p>Basra in three weeks (Dr. al-Sadi), had been disheartened </p><p>to learn that a Kuwaiti company had been selected to do a </p><p>similar job.  A few major projects with Iraqi business </p><p>participation would, they thought, go a long way to </p><p>bolster the Coalition\'s image among Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Looking for Cover </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The businessmen said that they were ready to </p><p>take financial and business risk in investing and trading </p><p>in Iraq.  However, they felt that there was a necessary </p><p>role for the types of political risk cover provided by </p><p>institutions like the International Finance Corporation </p><p>and OPIC.  Such guarantees would be especially important, </p><p>they said, until new financial and legal institutions </p><p>were established in Iraq.  They said official export </p><p>credits would also be very helpful in providing Iraqi </p><p>businesspeople with the resources to finance imports. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  There is indeed a significant Amman-based </p><p>Iraqi business community that was active in trading with </p><p>Iraq during the sanctions period.  Members of this </p><p>community are not well known to the embassy, with which </p><p>they avoided contact during the sanctions years.  Some of </p><p>them may have been involved in activities that we could </p><p>not condone.  Nonetheless, business people like the ones </p><p>we met probably have financial capital, technical </p><p>capacity, and knowledge of the situation on the ground in </p><p>Iraq to which we would not otherwise have access, either </p><p>inside or outside Iraq.  It could be useful to keep up a </p><p>dialogue with them and see what they are actually able to </p><p>deliver.  Following is bio information gleaned from </p><p>participants in the meeting that may be useful to CPA and </p><p>Washington agencies. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Bio Notes </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>-- Jalal Al-Gaaod is a member of the Dulaim tribe of </p><p>central Iraq and General Manager of Nass Lubricants and </p><p>Chemicals Plant, which was involved in the oil-for-food </p><p>program prior to the end of sanctions.  His brother Talal </p><p>al-Gaaod runs companies for importing and servicing </p><p>agricultural machinery.  Both were also involved in the </p><p>oil-for-food program. </p><p> </p><p>-- Dr. Majid al-Sadi is the Basra-born chairman of </p><p>Eastern Investment Group, a holding company with </p><p>interests in industrial and telecom sectors.  The group\'s </p><p>most prominent component is its partnership with the UK </p><p>Alpha group, in providing in-flight catering services at </p><p>Amman\'s Queen Alia Airport.  (Mr. Lionel Wilton, UK </p><p>citizen and Alpha employee also sat in on the meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Dr. Fouad al-Zubaidi is the chairman of Union </p><p>Marketing Company, a holding company for various chemical </p><p>and industrial companies.  Among other things, the </p><p>company produced detergents for export to Iraq under the </p><p>bilateral trade protocol. </p><p> </p><p>-- Ali Al-Khawwam is the General Director of the Riyadh </p><p>Investment Companies Group, which has been in operation </p><p>for 15 years in Jordan and has operated in Iraq during </p><p>the past ten years as a contractor dealing with </p><p>industrial projects there.  According Khawwam, the Group </p><p>owns the largest food and detergent factories in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>-- Ahenis Al-Jabori is general manager of Winter </p><p>International, Ltd., a conglomerate with interests in air </p><p>conditioning manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and </p><p>gas, and the health sector (in which Al-Jabori claims </p><p>ownership of one of the two or three largest firms </p><p>present in Iraq).  Al-Jabori said he had substantial pre- </p><p>sanctions experience in Iraq as an agent for foreign </p><p>corporations attempting to do business in Iraq, including </p><p>a joint venture with General Motors and with Mercedes to </p><p>provide automobiles for the Iraqi market that was </p><p>launched in 1988 before being abandoned. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
