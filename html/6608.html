<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY ROCCA AND SA/INS </p><p>FROM ASHLEY WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: APER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  JIM WALLER </p><p> </p><p>1.  As you know, the Sri Lankan account has been very </p><p>busy these past few months and promises to remain so for </p><p>a long period. I doubt Jim Waller realized when he took </p><p>over the Desk just how much work there would be!  In the </p><p>event, he has nevertheless has performed wonderfully in </p><p>support of this Mission, and I want to bring his </p><p>outstanding work to your attention.  Unfailingly polite </p><p>and self effacing, Jim Waller is incredibly hard </p><p>working, detail-oriented and fluent in his drafting, </p><p>whether preparing briefing memos for D or email reports </p><p>giving us in Colombo a sense of how things are unfolding </p><p>in Washington.  In the hurly burly of our profession, </p><p>especially now that the whole Department is under siege </p><p>because of the war in Iraq, I wanted to take this </p><p>occasion to single out Jim Waller for my warmest praise </p><p>and thanks for a job extremely well done. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
