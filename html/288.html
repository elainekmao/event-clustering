<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 04004 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR KOLKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PHUM, MZ, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  RENAMO KILLS MORE CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN </p><p>          ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. HARARE 2478 (NOTAL), B. 88 HARRE 6792 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS REPORTS, ON THE NIGHT OF </p><p>JULY 1, RENAMO KILLED FOUR CIVILIANS IN AN ATTACK IN THE </p><p>RUSHINGA AREA OF NORTHERN ZIMBABWE.  THE ATTACK5S SHOT </p><p>DEAD A 27 YEAR OLD FARMER AND THEN BURNED DOWN THE HUT </p><p>CONTAINING HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN, AGED FIVE AND TWO </p><p>YEARS OLD. AN EARLIER ATTACK IN THE SAME AREA WAS </p><p>REPORTED REF A. </p><p>- </p><p>2. (C) POLOFF SPOKE ON JULY12 WITH FATHER HANSKO OF </p><p>MARYMOUNT MISSION ABOUT THE REFAMO ATTACK.  HANSKO SAI </p><p>THAT THE JULY 1 ATTACK TOOK PLACE SOME 10 KM INSIDE THE </p><p>BORDER WITH MOZAMBIQUE AND SOME 40 KM FROM THE MISSION. </p><p>AN EARLIER ATTACK, PERHAPS THAT REPORTED REF A, TOOK </p><p>PLACE ONLY 1.5 KM FROM THE MISSION.  HANSKO SAID, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT SECURITY AT THE MISSION IS NOT A PROBLEM.  SOME 100 </p><p>PEOPLE ARE NOW LIVING NEARBY IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE POLICE ENCAMPED THERE </p><p>(REF B).  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN "GENTLY" ENCOURAGING </p><p>PEOPLE FROM ISOLATED BORDER SETTLEMENTS TO SEEK </p><p>PROTECTION AT NIGHT AT SUCH GUARDED POINTS AS PART OF </p><p>ITS "VILLAGIZATION" PROGRAM.  THE GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY </p><p>PROVIDING THOSE WHO AGREE TO SO GATHER WITH FOOD AID. </p><p>HANSKO BELIEVES THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAM TO BE WELL </p><p>ADVISED.  HE ESTIMATES THAT HALF OF THE POPULATION EAST </p><p>OF MARYMOUNT TO THE BORDER HAS FLED SINCE RENAMO BEGAN </p><p>HITTING THE AREA.  HENSKO ADDED THAT WHILE HE IS HOPEFUL </p><p>THAT THE SIGNS OF MOVEMENT TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS IN </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE WILL LEAD TO REAL PEACE, HE IS AFRAID THAT </p><p>IN ANY LEADUP TO TALKS, RENAMO WILL SEEK TO INCREASE </p><p>ITS LEVERAGE OVER THE GOZ BY INCREASING ITS ATTACKS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LARSEN </p><p></p></div>
