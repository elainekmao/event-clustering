<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 003717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/NCE, DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PL, RO, LO, BU, EZ, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE SIGNS ACCORD WITH CZECH REPUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  THE HOLY SEE SIGNED A JURIDICAL ACCORD WITH THE </p><p>CZECH REPUBLIC JULY 25 REGULATING THE STATUS OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE AGREEMENT, REACHED AFTER THREE YEARS </p><p>OF OCCASIONALLY DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS, GUARANTEES THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH FREEDOM TO CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES, IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03717  291456Z </p><p>PARTICULAR WORSHIP, GOVERNMENT OF ITS JURISDICTIONS, AND </p><p>EDUCATION.  IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE CIVIL EFFECTS OF A </p><p>CHURCH MARRIAGE.  THE CZECH GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE </p><p>CHURCH THE RIGHT TO OFFER PASTORAL CARE IN HOSPITALS, </p><p>SOCIAL CARE CENTERS AND PRISONS.  CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WILL </p><p>HAVE THE SAME STATUS AS STATE INSTITUTIONS WITH </p><p>COMMENSURATE RIGHTS AND DUTIES. THE AGREEMENT DID NOT </p><p>ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE RESTITUTION OF CHURCH PROPERTY </p><p>EXPROPRIATED BY THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT BEYOND </p><p>HORTATORY LANGUAGE COMMITTING TO A RESOLUTION AT THE </p><p>EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS ONE OF THE LAST EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES TO ENTER INTO SUCH A JURIDICAL AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>THE HOLY SEE.  ACCORDING TO MONSIGNOR MICHAEL BANACH, </p><p>DESK OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CZECH REPUBLIC, THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT, AND THE HOLY SEE </p><p>ULTIMATELY ACCEPTED LESS BINDING AND MORE NEUTRAL </p><p>LANGUAGE THAN THEY HAD SOUGHT IN SOME AREAS IN ORDER TO </p><p>ACHIEVE A TEXT ACCEPTABLE TO THE CABINET THAT WOULD HAVE </p><p>A CHANCE OF SECURING PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL.  BECAUSE OF </p><p>ANTI-CLERICAL SENTIMENTS THAT STILL PREVAIL IN THE CZECH </p><p>REPUBLIC, THE HOLY SEE IS NOT CERTAIN HOW DIFFICULT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL IS LIKELY TO BE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BANACH SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF CATHOLIC </p><p>MARRIAGES AND THE RECOGNITION OF CATHOLIC EDUCATION ON A </p><p>PAR WITH THE STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>CATHOLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE CZECH REPUBLIC HAD REMAINED </p><p>RELATIVELY STRONG, EVEN DURING THE COMMUNIST ERA. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03717  291456Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  COMMENT:  THE HOLY SEE HAS CONCLUDED SIMILAR </p><p>AGREEMENTS OR BROADER CONCORDATS WITH MOST COUNTRIES IN </p><p>CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE JURIDICAL FOUNDATION OF ITS PRESENCE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  POLAND, WITH A COMPLETE CONCORDAT </p><p>IS THE FURTHEST ALONG, AND HUNGARY AND THE SLOVAK </p><p>REPUBLIC WITH A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO FAR </p><p>ADVANCED.  THE CZECH REPUBLIC AGREEMENT HAD BEEN THE MOST </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CONCLUDE WITHIN THE REGION.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>REGARDS AGREEMENTS WITH PREDOMINANTLY ORTHODOX ROMANIA AS </p><p>UNLIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WHILE AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>BULGARIA ARE SEEN AS POSSIBLE BUT NOT IMMINENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03717 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
