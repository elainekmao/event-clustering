<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001973 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 2, continue </p><p>to focus on the developments in the war in Iraq. </p><p>Banner headlines highlight the civilian death toll in </p><p>Iraq.  Al-Dustour, Al-Arab Al-Yawm and the Jordan </p><p>Times carry a similar photo of a man crying and </p><p>shouting as the bodies of three small children are </p><p>placed in a coffin in front of him.  All papers also </p><p>highlight King Abdullah\'s meeting with his cabinet, </p><p>during which he expressed reassurance about the </p><p>Jordanian government\'s measures to protect Jordanians\' </p><p>safety and express concern for the rising number of </p><p>civilian casualties among the Iraqi people.  Papers </p><p>also refer to the letter sent by U.S. Ambassador to </p><p>Jordan, Edward Gnehm, to the Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, offering his condolences for the death of </p><p>five Jordanians killed in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Jews, Zionists, and the title is occupation" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan concludes his article on the </p><p>back page of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Arab Al-Yawm (04/02):  "For us Arabs, we view what is </p><p>happening as yet another image of the invaders who </p><p>crossed our lands in barbaric wars (whether holy or </p><p>unholy wars).  We realize that the invaders may </p><p>eventually succeed, with the massive force they have, </p><p>in entering the cities of Iraq, the Arab country that </p><p>is standing alone without the support of any of its </p><p>brothers.  We realize that the occupation may succeed </p><p>in occupying all of Iraq.  However, they will fail, </p><p>from day one, to be of an image other than that of </p><p>occupiers, invaders, opportunists and criminals.  This </p><p>alone is sufficient to keep the resistance going even </p><p>for the next one hundred years." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The American crisis" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/02):  "In the first week of the Anglo-American </p><p>aggression against Iraq, focus was directed to </p><p>military and leadership targets, in an efforts to </p><p>convince the Iraqi people that the Americans and the </p><p>English are launching their war against the regime and </p><p>not the people.  They had expected that the Iraqi </p><p>people would view them as liberators rather than </p><p>occupiers.  Within the first week of launching the </p><p>aggression, the American leadership became convinced </p><p>that this vision does not exist, because the fierce </p><p>Iraqi resistance faced by the invading forces was not </p><p>only regular forces, but also included popular </p><p>organizations.  The Iraqi people, with all its </p><p>sectors, rose in defense of his homeland..  As of the </p><p>second week of the war, the American plans shifted and </p><p>changed.  They acknowledged that the forces are not </p><p>enough . and most importantly they shifted from </p><p>targeting the regime\'s institutions to striking </p><p>popular markets and residential areas, in a clear </p><p>attempt to avenge themselves against the Iraqi people. </p><p>The Iraqis in 1991 were not completely convinced of </p><p>the need to fight and sacrifice to keep Kuwait, as </p><p>they were faced with the Arab and international public </p><p>opinion and the thirty-country alliance supported by </p><p>Arab and international communities.  It really felt </p><p>like a war to liberate Kuwait.  However, in 2003, the </p><p>picture is different.  The Iraqis are defending their </p><p>homeland against invaders and aggressors, whose </p><p>intentions and objectives are as clear as day, and </p><p>whose movements and plans are rejected both on the </p><p>Arab and on the international levels." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
