REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  On April 8 a delegation of Bhutanese refugees from </p><p>eastern Nepal met with poloff to raise a number of concerns </p><p>about ongoing discussions between the Governments of Nepal </p><p>and Bhutan regarding the refugees\' categorization and </p><p>possible repatriation to Bhutan.  Among such concerns are </p><p>whether returnees will be able to reclaim their former </p><p>property; what will happen to returnees who are ultimately </p><p>denied Bhutanese citizenship; whether members of the same </p><p>family will be categorized differently; and whether the </p><p>Bhutanese Government will allow UNHCR monitoring of </p><p>repatriation.  The refugees asked the USG to maintain </p><p>pressure on the Bhutanese to offer returnees equitable </p><p>treatment, including the reinstatement of their citizenship. </p><p>The Embassy has seen no evidence thus far that the Nepali and </p><p>Bhutanese governments are addressing these concerns in </p><p>continuing discussions of the refugee problem.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>REFUGEES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT REPATRIATION </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On April 8 a six-man delegation, composed of the </p><p>secretaries of the six Bhutanese refugee camps in eastern </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Nepal, visited poloff to discuss the reported agreement </p><p>between the Governments of Nepal and Bhutan regarding </p><p>categorization of the refugees and probable numbers eligible </p><p>for repatriation to Bhutan (Ref A).  Although no one from </p><p>either government has briefed the refugee community on the </p><p>agreement, the delegation said they understood from press </p><p>reports that about 60 percent of the "verified" refugees had </p><p>been classified as "voluntary" emigrants from Bhutan.  The </p><p>Government of Bhutan (GOB) reportedly had agreed to take back </p><p>refugees in this voluntary category with the proviso that </p><p>they must reapply for Bhutanese citizenship.  The returnees </p><p>would have two years within which they must qualify for </p><p>citizenship.  The refugee leaders believed that those </p><p>classified as non-Bhutanese or criminals would not be </p><p>accepted for repatriation under any conditions.  (Note: </p><p>Details of the agreement have not been made public.  The </p><p>refugees\' understanding, however, tracks generally with what </p><p>we were told privately by the MFA.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The refugee representatives expressed concern that </p><p>the two governments had not sought input from the refugee </p><p>community in drafting the agreement.  By their own </p><p>estimation, the delegates said that approximately 80 percent </p><p>of the 100,000 refugees likely fall into the "voluntary" </p><p>migrant category.  (Note:  The refugees maintain that </p><p>"voluntary" is a polite fiction, since, they claim, the GOB </p><p>forced most of them to sign documents asserting that they </p><p>were leaving the country of their own free will.  Many of </p><p>those who signed such documents--illiterate Nepali-speaking </p><p>farmers--could not read or understand the language in which </p><p>the documents were written.  End note.)  Where will the </p><p>returnees live while their applications for citizenship are </p><p>being reviewed over the two-year period?  The land in Bhutan </p><p>formerly owned by the refugees has since been occupied by </p><p>others, the delegation  charged; there is little hope of </p><p>reclaiming it.  The GOB might put them in "transit camps" </p><p>pending review of their citizenship claims, they worried. </p><p>Who will monitor their treatment in Bhutan, given the GOB\'s </p><p>persistent refusal to entertain a UNHCR presence? they asked. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Ramesh Subha, Secretary at the Beldangi I camp, </p><p>said the refugees had heard that the GOB is setting up </p><p>"camps" for laborers in the barren northeast of the country. </p><p>Noting that GOB had reportedly committed to provide </p><p>employment for the returnees, Subha speculated that the </p><p>returnees might be resettled in these camps to work as manual </p><p>laborers for prospective hydropower projects.  Of greatest </p><p>concern to the delegation, however, was what they perceived </p><p>as the uncertain fate of returnees who must reapply for </p><p>citizenship.  The same regime that had once branded them as </p><p>undesirables and forced them out of the country remains in </p><p>power, they observed.  Should the GOB ultimately reject their </p><p>applications--and most seemed to believe this a likely </p><p>outcome--would they be forced out again? </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The delegation also voiced concern about the </p><p>possibility that members of the same family might be </p><p>categorized differently, thus increasing the difficulty of </p><p>family reunification.  Of particular concern, they said, is </p><p>the GOB\'s reported refusal to accept those designated as </p><p>"criminals."  A person can be classified as a "criminal" in </p><p>Bhutan without ever having been charged with a crime, they </p><p>asserted, let alone convicted.  Anyone perceived as having </p><p>pursued "anti-national activities," such as participating in </p><p>a political rally, could fall into that category.  (Note: </p><p>Most of the camp secretaries apparently spent some time in </p><p>jail in Bhutan for political activism.  End note.)  Even if </p><p>the children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews of those </p><p>deemed "criminals" are allowed to return, they might well be </p><p>barred from enrolling in school, according to T.B. Gurung, </p><p>Secretary at Khudunabari Camp, since enrollment requires a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>certificate of "no objection" from the local authorities. </p><p>Some of his relatives still in Bhutan are unable to enroll </p><p>their children in school because of his earlier political </p><p>activism, Gurung noted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>APPEAL TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Government of Nepal is anxious to achieve a </p><p>settlement and thus unlikely to raise these issues during </p><p>negotiation of the agreement, the delegation said.  The </p><p>refugees thus must depend on "influential" third countries </p><p>like the US to maintain pressure on the GOB to offer </p><p>returnees as equitable and humane treatment as possible.  In </p><p>particular, they stressed, the refugees want reinstatement of </p><p>their former property, reinstatement of their lost </p><p>citizenship, and GOB agreement to allow UNHCR monitoring of </p><p>repatriation and resettlement within Bhutan.  Poloff thanked </p><p>the delegation for their presentation and assured them of USG </p><p>interest in the matter.  Noting our limited engagement with </p><p>the GOB, poloff urged the delegation to contact other local </p><p>diplomatic and aid missions, such as the Swiss and the EU, </p><p>that provide significant aid to Bhutan.  The delegation did </p><p>not inquire about prospects for third-country resettlement. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Governments of Nepal and Bhutan, we have been </p><p>told by the Nepalese Foreign Secretary, have agreed to send a </p><p>bilateral team soon to the camps to brief the refugees on the </p><p>content of the agreement (Ref A).  In the meantime, however, </p><p>news--most of it apparently accurate--of the agreement has </p><p>leaked to the community, leaving them to draw their own </p><p>conclusions regarding its implementation.  The concerns they </p><p>raise are valid, as is, we believe, their fear that these </p><p>awkward questions are being swept under the carpet in the two </p><p>governments\' haste to conclude an agreement.  The Government </p><p>of Nepal has already indicated to us that the GOB has not </p><p>budged on its objection to UNHCR involvement in the </p><p>repatriation process within Bhutan.  The Embassy believes it </p><p>important that the USG and donor countries continue to </p><p>impress upon the GOB the need to resolve this long-standing </p><p>problem as fairly and expeditiously as possible. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
