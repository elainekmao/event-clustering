Westley for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 2 to assess </p><p>threat information and discuss contingency planning for a </p><p>possible conflict with Iraq and other security-related </p><p>matters.  Key offices and personnel represented at the </p><p>meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, </p><p>ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, RMO, FPD AND FBI.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Current Threat Assessment </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  EAC discussed the current threat environment, </p><p>concluding that nothing new had come up to change the threat </p><p>assessment.  EAC discussed the arrest of senior al-Qaeda </p><p>leader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan, noting that it </p><p>could hinder attacks in Yemen if he provides information and </p><p>if al-Qaeda lies low following the arrest.  The possibility </p><p>of shooting attacks against motorists in light of recent </p><p>attacks in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was reiterated, with a </p><p>reminder that Mission personnel should continue to exercise </p><p>caution by varying times and routes, being unpredictable, and </p><p>making maximum use of armored Embassy vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Warden Meeting Scheduled for March 3 </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  EAC discussed the timeliness of the Warden meeting </p><p>scheduled for March 3 as part of the Embassy\'s regular </p><p>communication with the American community.  Other scheduled </p><p>contingency consultations include:  DCM meetings with the </p><p>Local Guard Force to discuss perimeter security (especially </p><p>after the recent Karachi attack);  RSO contacts with all U.S. </p><p>Fulbright students in country;  DCM meeting with spouses of </p><p>U.S. employees;  RSO meeting with Amideast deputy director; </p><p>and RSO follow-up at the Yemeni-American Language Institute. </p><p>EAC members have heard increased questions from the larger </p><p>expatriate community about what they should do in light of a </p><p>possible war in Iraq and the drawdowns of British, Dutch and </p><p>German Embassy staff. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Securing International Schools </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4,  (C)  RSO briefed the EAC on efforts to secure </p><p>international schools, including the Ambassador\'s 2/26 </p><p>meeting with the Ministry of Interior.  On the basis of </p><p>Ambassador\'s proposal to the Minister of a security </p><p>partnership -- in which the schools will take certain </p><p>unilateral security steps and the ROYG will provide a static </p><p>security presence at school sites during school hours plus </p><p>mobile response teams around the clock -- follow-up is </p><p>underway.  A group of representatives from the international </p><p>schools and several embassies (including Embassy Sanaa RSO) </p><p>met with Interior officials 2/27 to discuss what the schools </p><p>must do and what the ROYG could provide in terms of extra </p><p>protection.  The group is developing a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding (MOU) for the ROYG that it hopes will help </p><p>facilitate security assistance, including police escorts, </p><p>concrete barriers and improved communications.  Embassy Sanaa </p><p>is a leading participant in this effort. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Other Mission Drawdowns </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  EAC discussed drawdowns of other Embassies (notably </p><p>Dutch, British and German) and international organizations in </p><p>Yemen, including the UN.  RSO reported that the UN in Sanaa </p><p>is preparing a report for New York to recommend that </p><p>facilitation of the departure of more than 130 family members </p><p>if necessary.  Several other small missions, including </p><p>French, Japanese and Italian, are standing fast.  DCM </p><p>reported that at the USG authorized departure posts in the </p><p>region approximately 50% of dependents have left post. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Vaccinations and Disaster Response </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  EAC discussed the 2/23-25 smallpox immunization </p><p>program, noting that only one person had fallen ill after the </p><p>shot and that it could not be definitively traced to the </p><p>vaccine.  The person is now healthy.  The RMO also discussed </p><p>the future anthrax vaccinations and the possibility that the </p><p>vaccines thought to be spoiled might be usable, pending the </p><p>Department\'s analysis.  RMO briefed the EAC on disaster </p><p>response discussions with ROYG officials, including the </p><p>Minister of Health.  Yemeni authorities have the ability to </p><p>analyze suspect powder and determine if it is/is not anthrax, </p><p>but were generally pessimistic about their other CBW response </p><p>abilities and requested assistance from the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  RMO briefed EAC on the ongoing First Responder </p><p>training, and noted upcoming training in bio-chemical </p><p>response to include CBW escape mask training on March 10 with </p><p>a visiting expert team. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Contingency Preparation:  "StandFast" and "MoveSafe" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  DCM briefed the EAC on the guidelines for Embassy </p><p>response to a possible Iraq contingency that would require a </p><p>temporary closure and reduced or modified Embassy staffing. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  A declaration of StandFast would entail immediate </p><p>closure of the Embassy and curtailment of all but essential </p><p>operations.  American staff performing essential functions </p><p>would reside in the Embassy or the Alternate Command Center, </p><p>while all other staff will remain in their residences.  DCM </p><p>circulated a classified staff list designating each </p><p>employee\'s StandFast location.  The Embassy would be closed </p><p>to the public, with no vehicle traffic in or out except for </p><p>essential operational travel (e.g., to/from ROYG ministries </p><p>authorized by the Chief of Mission).  FSN staff performing </p><p>essential functions would be admitted to the Embassy on the </p><p>basis of an Access List updated daily by the RSO. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  A declaration of MoveSafe would entail a less </p><p>restrictive limitation on the movement of American personnel </p><p>outside their residences or the Embassy compound.  Embassy </p><p>operations may be shut down or curtailed to a limited degree </p><p>if designated by the COM.  Travel would be allowed only in </p><p>armored vehicles.  Non-essential American and FSN staff would </p><p>be allowed access to the Embassy in accordance with the level </p><p>of Embassy operations and the COM\'s assessment of security </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  DCM briefed the EAC on plans for daily situation </p><p>reporting should hostilities occur between Iraq and coalition </p><p>forces.  He asked that each section provide information to </p><p>the Political/Economic section early for inclusion in a daily </p><p>sitrep to be sent out via classified e-mail or cable by </p><p>mid-afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Security Drills and Radio Checks </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  RSO held an intruder drill on February 27 that </p><p>showed some deficiencies in staff knowledge on how to </p><p>respond.  More intruder drills will be held in the immediate </p><p>future.  RSO also conducted ongoing destruction drills with </p><p>various sections.  All sections were reminded to minimize </p><p>their burn time. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  EAC noted the success of weekend radio notification </p><p>by RSO and Post One of several peaceful demonstrations in </p><p>Sanaa (2/28, 3/1, 3/2), which instructed personnel on the </p><p>location of demonstrations and to avoid non-essential travel. </p><p> EAC also announced an intensified schedule of radio checks </p><p>in the coming days.  EAC emphasized the importance of </p><p>everyone carrying their radios at all times. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Demonstrations, Security Violations, EAP, Aggressive Driving </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  EAC emphasized that everyone should report </p><p>information gained on possible demonstrations or incidents </p><p>related to demonstrations to the RSO.  DCM reminded staff to </p><p>remain vigilant regarding security violations, especially </p><p>during this busy time.  EAC members were reminded to read and </p><p>comment on post\'s updated Emergency Action Plan. RSO asked </p><p>EAC members to caution their staff to be more mindful of </p><p>their driving habits, including avoiding unnecessary </p><p>aggressive driving that could draw adverse attention from </p><p>ROYG police and/or pedestrians. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
