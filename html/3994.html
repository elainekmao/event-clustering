<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006024 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY, SA, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: S/CT COORDINATOR TAYLOR\'S OCTOBER 10 MEETING WITH </p><p>FM MUASHER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) In a cordial meeting October 10 with FonMin </p><p>Muasher, visiting S/CT Coordinator Francis X. Taylor conveyed </p><p>the U.S.\'s appreciation for Jordan\'s superb cooperation on </p><p>the war on terrorism, reiterated strong U.S. interest in </p><p>stopping Iranian resupply flights to Hizbullah, and said that </p><p>as the international community\'s combined efforts to fight </p><p>terror proceeds, a greater focus will center on the legal </p><p>sphere.  Muasher noted that, after an apparent lull, </p><p>Hizbullah -- with Syrian blessing  -- has once again </p><p>ratcheted up its activities.  The Syrians, Muasher opined, </p><p>want to make sure "no one forgets them."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Visiting S/CT Coordinator Francis Taylor, accompanied </p><p>by the Ambassador, S/CT Mark Shaheen, and Poloff, met with </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher October 10.  Also present was </p><p>Muasher\'s personal assistant Ashraf Zeitoon. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Many Thanks </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Ambassador Taylor began the meeting by conveying to </p><p>Muasher the USG\'s "great appreciation for Jordan\'s superb </p><p>coordination with us and with others in the war on </p><p>terrorism."  Taylor characterized U.S.-Jordanian CT </p><p>cooperation as "strong as any we have."  FM Muasher responded </p><p>that "we too are happy" with the level of CT cooperation </p><p>between the two countries.  In this context, Muasher noted </p><p>joint U.S.-GOJ efforts to extradite Mullah Krekar from the </p><p>Netherlands as a concrete example of that cooperation (He </p><p>also characterized Dutch action thus far on the Krekar case </p><p>as "not as helpful as they could be.") </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Taylor agreed that the Krekar case constituted an </p><p>important opportunity, and added that it highlighted the </p><p>increasingly important role cooperation in the legal sphere </p><p>will play in the war on terrorism.  He said that UNSCR 1373 </p><p>has provided the international community the framework to </p><p>tackle the threat of terrorism, and it is now vitally </p><p>important for countries to put in place laws to make that </p><p>happen.  He underlined that the U.S. stood ready to assist </p><p>Jordan in any way in this effort. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Iranian Overflights </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Ambassador Taylor then raised the issue of Iranian </p><p>overflights and the destabilizing consequences of Iran\'s </p><p>resupply of weaponry to Hizbullah.  Taylor stressed that </p><p>"this is a very, very important issue for us, and one we are </p><p>raising with all our partners in the region.  We want to shut </p><p>it off, and get the Iranians to change their approach."  He </p><p>noted that visiting Washington analysts had had very useful </p><p>discussions earlier that day with their Jordanian </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Muasher responded that Jordan "wants to do what we </p><p>can" on the issue.  He noted two concerns: (1) "that we can </p><p>do this under international law," and (2) that the flights </p><p>"are only over our territory for three minutes."  Although </p><p>stating that Jordan takes this issue seriously and would </p><p>study any new information the U.S. provides carefully, he </p><p>added "we think the Saudis\' ability to act is much greater </p><p>than ours." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Hizbullah\'s Actions and Syrian Motivations </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Muasher noted that Hizbullah\'s activities "appear to </p><p>be picking up again, after a lull for a while." (Note: </p><p>Earlier in the day, the GID had provided Ambassador Taylor an </p><p>extensive briefing on Hizbullah\'s activities in the region </p><p>and in Jordan, and on the GOJ\'s efforts to counter them.  End </p><p>note.)  The reason for this, he said, was that "the Syrians </p><p>want to tell everyone not to forget them, not to exclude </p><p>them.  Since 9/11 they have felt nervous that their role in </p><p>the Peace Process is not as it was before, and that they </p><p>don\'t have as much power to control things as they once did. </p><p>They are not happy with our role because we have kind of </p><p>replaced them as the third leg, and they are also clashing </p><p>more and more with the Saudis and the Egyptians.  At every </p><p>meeting we have with them, I end up having an argument with </p><p>Shara\'a -- I don\'t even have to open my mouth." </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Ambassador Taylor cleared on this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
