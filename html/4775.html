<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI LEVELS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BRITAIN AND </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a move that could create quite a firestorm, </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>issued a press statement on December 18 accusing the British </p><p>and South African governments of working in cahoots with </p><p>certain elements of ZANU-PF to maintain the ruling party\'s </p><p>hold on power.  In his statement, Tsvangirai said "...a cabal </p><p>within ZANU-PF, working with some businessmen, have hatched a </p><p>plan to protect Mugabe and his regime, for political </p><p>convenience, through a further militarization of Zimbabwe. </p><p>One Colonel Dyke (sic) and his business associates are being </p><p>used to promote an agenda that seeks to legitimize the rogue </p><p>regime.  The names of (Speaker of Parliament and ZANU-PF </p><p>Secretary of Administration) Emmerson Mnangagwa and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(Commander of the Defense Forces) General Zvinavashe keep on </p><p>coming up in this dirty plan which we are told was endorsed </p><p>by ZANU-PF, the British and the South Africans."  Tsvangirai </p><p>goes on to say that this effort is intended to be </p><p>kick-started by a meeting between himself and Robert Mugabe </p><p>outside the country, but warns that "the Anglo-South African </p><p>plan will fail to take off if it remains predicated on the </p><p>desire to legitimize the illegitimate Mugabe regime. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Comment:  Tsvangirai clearly has heard of efforts by </p><p>several different parties to broker a political way forward </p><p>and has assumed they are all part and parcel of the same </p><p>initiative.  It is unclear why he decided to shine the public </p><p>spotlight on these efforts now.  We surmise that he wanted to </p><p>avoid being presented with a political solution that involved </p><p>token MDC membership in a ZANU-PF government as a fait </p><p>accompli, and being portrayed as the intransigent party for </p><p>refusing to endorse such an approach.  It will be interesting </p><p>to see how the Zimbabwean and South African governments react </p><p>to Tsvangirai\'s statement.  What seems a likely consequence </p><p>is that South Africa and other potential political brokers </p><p>might pull back from peace-making efforts in the near-term. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>South African efforts on Zimbabwe </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Prior to the issuance of Tsvangirai\'s statement, his </p><p>senior advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, received a call from </p><p>President Mbeki\'s office the night of December 17, asking </p><p>whether Tsvangirai was prepared to travel outside of Zimbabwe </p><p>to meet with President Mugabe.  The caller said the SAG could </p><p>arrange for the temporary return of Tsvangirai\'s passport, </p><p>seized when the MDC leader was charged with treason for </p><p>allegedly planning Mugabe\'s assassination.   Mudzingwa </p><p>subsequently sought additional details from the intelligence </p><p>chief at the South African High Commission in Harare, who </p><p>said he was not fully briefed on this initiative.  The South </p><p>African intelligence officer, however, reported that Foreign </p><p>Minister Zuma was planning a trip to Harare in the next week </p><p>or two to meet with Tsvangirai and Emmerson Mnangagwa. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Meanwhile, we know that Father Fidelis Mukonori, who </p><p>has on several past occasions attempted to broker dialogue </p><p>between President Mugabe and the MDC, has once again begun to </p><p>feel out both sides on their willingness to talk.  He has </p><p>not, however, put a concrete proposal on the table.  Mukonori </p><p>had not spoken with senior MDC leaders in quite some time </p><p>until contacting Mudzingwa to arrange a meeting on December </p><p>18.  We will get a readout of that conversation and report it </p><p>septel. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
