<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003640 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR A/S QUARLES, DAS RADELET, MICHAEL KAPLAN </p><p>DEPT FOR E, NEA, EB </p><p>NSC FOR CLAY LOWERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: FS STRAW LETTER TO G7 ON JORDAN DEBT </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 03617 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, reasons 1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (c)  As reported reftel, the following is the text of the </p><p>UK Foreign Secretary\'s June 14, 2002 letter to G7 colleagues. </p><p> This text was provided to us on July 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c)  Begin text: </p><p>&I am writing to ask for your continuing support for Jordan </p><p>their discussions with the IMF and Paris Club Creditors.  Now </p><p>is an important time for us all to demonstrate our support </p><p>for a key ally in the coalition against terrorism and a force </p><p>for stability in an unstable region. </p><p> </p><p>Jordan,s economic performance remains blighted, and social </p><p>problems exacerbated, but regional tensions which impede its </p><p>trade with the West Bank and Israel on the one hand and Iraq </p><p>on the other.  Recent events in the West Bank have not made </p><p>things any easier. </p><p> </p><p>In these difficult circumstances I believe King Abdullah is </p><p>continuing to show strong economic leadership.  His Plan for </p><p>Social and Economic Transformation, announced last autumn, is </p><p>a serious attempt to push forward with structural reforms ) </p><p>building on Jordan,s already good record ) while finding </p><p>some new resources to ease social problems.  It is clear that </p><p>the Plan is not going to be allowed to compromise sound </p><p>macroeconomic management: spending this year is being </p><p>tailored to available resources while the authorities have </p><p>announced new, politically sensitive, revenue raising </p><p>measures.  I was struck by the warmth of the endorsement of </p><p>Jordan,s policies given in discussion in the latest IMF </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>Jordan,s good economic management will produce its own </p><p>reward in the form of strong performance once normal </p><p>relations with its neighbours are possible.  But in the </p><p>meantime Jordan is labouring under difficulties which are not </p><p>of its own making and I believe the King deserves our </p><p>support.  As you know, discussions between the IMF and the </p><p>Jordanian authorities on a new programme are advancing. </p><p>Policy measures in the programme are likely to be consistent </p><p>with the King,s Plan for Social and Economic Transformation, </p><p>while extra resources from the Fund may have a role to play </p><p>in allowing the Plan to go ahead, and social issues to be </p><p>addressed, more rapidly.  This will be particularly important </p><p>in the forthcoming election year.  If the IMF Staff make a </p><p>good case for further IMF lending we will be favourably </p><p>disposed to support; I hope you will also. </p><p> </p><p>If a new IMF programme is agreed Jordan may well seek a </p><p>further rescheduling from the Paris Club.  If so, I believe </p><p>creditors can and should help.  The British Government is </p><p>willing to press for the most generous possible rescheduling. </p><p> We would hope that this would be the last time Jordan would </p><p>need to come to the Paris Club.  We have an open mind on how </p><p>this exit from the rescheduling cycle might be achieved, but </p><p>for instance if Jordan, supported by the IMF, judged that a </p><p>full stock rescheduling was in its long term interests we </p><p>would be supportive.  Furthermore the UK has already been </p><p>actively promoting conversion to equity of official Jordanian </p><p>debt to the UK, within existing Paris Club rules; we would </p><p>not only encourage others to do the same but would support </p><p>any Jordanian request to raise the current threshold. </p><p> </p><p>I would welcome your views on this matter and how we can take </p><p>it forward well in advance of any discussions in the Paris </p><p>Club. </p><p> </p><p>I am copying this letter to G7 colleagues8. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
