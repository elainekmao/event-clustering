SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE DEC 20 DECISION BY THE COMMONWEALTH </p><p>MINISTERIAL ACTION GROUP(CMAG) "TO EXPRESS ITS DEEP </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>CONTINUED VIOLENCE, OCCUPATION OF PROPERTY, ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MEDIA AND </p><p>POLITICAL INTIMIDATION" . (WHICH) "CONSTITUTES A SERIOUS </p><p>AND PERSISTENT VIOLATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH\'S </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL POLTICAL VALUES AND THE RULE OF LAW AS </p><p>ENSHRINED IN THE HARARE COMMONWEALTH DECLARATION" COMES </p><p>AS A SHOCK TO THE GOZ.  THE CMAG\'S DRAWING ATTENTION OF </p><p>THE GOZ TO ITS ABUJA AGREEMENT COMMITMENTS AND STRONG </p><p>URGING TO IMPLEMENT THESE COMMITMENTS COMES AS A </p><p>PARTICULAR BLOW, SINCE IT CONTRADICTS THE GOZ CLAIM THAT </p><p>IT HAS IMPLEMENTED ABUJA AND ONLY THE UK HAS FAILED TO </p><p>FULFILL ITS FUNDING COMMITMENTS. THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>NIGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LAMIDO ON THE CMAG AND HIS </p><p>SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS ON BBC, IN PARTICULAR UNDERMINE </p><p>THE GOZ PRETENSE TO BE ABIDING BY ABUJA.  THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF NIGERIA AND BOTSWANA IN THE CMAG, NOT TO MENTION </p><p>MALAYSIA, ALSO UNDERMINES THE GOZ ARGUMENT THAT ANY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03814  220544Z </p><p>CRITICISM OF ZIMBABWE IS A UK, EUROPEAN OR NORTH </p><p>AMERICAN PLOT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE CMAG STATEMENT LEFT THE STATE MEDIA </p><p>SPEECHLESS; THE BEST RESPONSE FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE </p><p>COULD MUSTER WAS A CLAIM THAT CMAG ACTIONWITHOUT A </p><p>CHOGOM DIRECTIVE WAS ILLEGAL (A POINT ON WHICH OUR UK </p><p>AND CANADIAN COLLEAGUES CONCED HE HAS HALF A POINT.) </p><p>OTHERWISE, HE FELL BACK ON UNSUSTAINABLE CLAIMS OF A </p><p>BRITISH CONSPIRACY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  COMING SO SHORTLY AFTER THE SADC </p><p>MINISTERIAL MISSION HAD AGREED WITH THE GOZ VIEW THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON THE LAND ISSUE </p><p>AND THAT VIOLENCE HAD DIMINISHED, THE CMAG REPORT IS A </p><p>MAJOR SHOCK FOR THE GOZ.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, CURRENTLY </p><p>VISITING LIBYA FOR ANOTHER INJECTION OF PETROL, WOULD </p><p>SEEM LIKELY TO REACT AS HE HAS TO ALL OTHER CRITICISMS, </p><p>WITH A " THEY CAN GO TO HELL."  BUT NIGERIA\'S JOINING IN </p><p>THE CRITICISM OF ZIMBABWE\'S ABUJA AGREEMENT PERFORMANCE </p><p>STRIPS BARE A MAJOR DEFENCE PLANK OF THE GOZ.  COUPLED </p><p>WITH RISING FOOD SHORTAGES AND OTHER PROBLEMS, MORE </p><p>VOICES IN THE GOZ AND ZUNU-PF ARE LIKELY TO QUESTION </p><p>WHETHER MUGABE AND ZANU-PF CAN TOUGH IT OUT IN ISOLATION </p><p>FROM THE NON-QADDAFI WORLD. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
