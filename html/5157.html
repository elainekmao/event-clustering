(C) VATICAN CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. GIORGIO </p><p>LINGUA TOLD US JANUARY 9 THAT THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>CAUTIOUS ABOUT "PRESSING THE ENVELOPE" FOR GREATER CHURCH </p><p>FREEDOMS IN CUBA.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00195  161459Z </p><p>WANTS TO CHANGE, BUT, LIKE THE CHINESE, ARE FEARFUL OF LOSING </p><p>CONTROL.  HE SAID THE POPE, WHO GREETED VARELA PROJECT AND </p><p>CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT FOUNDER OSVALDO PAYA AT THE END </p><p>OF A GENERAL AUDIENCE JANUARY 8 (REF A), WOULD NOT MEET </p><p>PRIVATELY WITH HIM, AS SPECULATED IN THE PRESS, BECAUSE THE </p><p>CHURCH DID NOT WISH TO PROVOKE A NEGATIVE REACTION FROM THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT.  PAYA REPORTEDLY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION </p><p>WITH THE BRIEF ENCOUNTER, CLAIMING "ONE CANNOT ASPIRE FOR </p><p>MORE IN AN IMPROVISED TRIP WITHOUT A FIXED AGENDA." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CUBAN EMBASSY TO THE </p><p>HOLY SEE, LINGUA SAYS HE HAS PRESSED THE CUBANS TO CULTIVATE </p><p>PAYA AS A "SOFT OPPOSITIONIST."  ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE </p><p>CUBAN EMBASSY CONSISTENTLY REPLIES BY DOWNPLAYING THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF THE OPPOSITION.  LINGUA SAID PAYA WAS A </p><p>COMMITTED CATHOLIC WHO WISHES TO WORK FOR CHANGE WITHIN </p><p>CUBA\'S SYSTEM.  HE TOLD US THAT WHEN THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT </p><p>REBUFFED THE VARELA PROJECT WITH THE REFERENDUM REAFFIRMING </p><p>THE SOCIALIST CONSTITUTION, PAYA TOLD THE CHURCH HE WAS HAPPY </p><p>THAT HIS APPROACH OF "USING THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF" HAD BEEN </p><p>"REAFFIRMED." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) QUERIED ON WHETHER THE CHURCH WAS CONTENT WITH THE </p><p>PACE OF CHANGE IN CUBA, LINGUA TOLD US THE CHURCH ASSIDUOUSLY </p><p>AVOIDS POLITICAL ACTIVISM, SO AS TO PROTECT SPACE FOR ITS </p><p>PASTORAL WORK.  HE TOLD US THE GOC HAD COMPLAINED ON OCCASION </p><p>ABOUT THE CHURCH\'S LIBRARIES, AND SOMETIMES IT REFUSED OR </p><p>RESTRICTED VISAS FOR CLERGY, BUT LINGUA DID NOT SIGNAL THAT </p><p>THE CHURCH WOULD TAKE THOSE RESTRICTIONS AS SERIOUSLY AS THEY </p><p>HAVE TAKEN THE RUSSIANS\' SIMILAR ACTIONS (NOTE: THE POPE </p><p>HIMSELF DECRIED THE RUSSIAN VISA REFUSALS IN HIS ANNUAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00195  161459Z </p><p>ADDRESS TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS JANUARY 13). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  LINGUA MENTIONED THAT THIS MONTH MARKS THE FIVE YEAR </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S GROUNDBREAKING VISIT TO CUBA.  HE </p><p>TOLD US (PROTECT) THAT THE GOC HAD INVITED THE POPE AND/OR FM </p><p>TAURAN TO VISIT THE ISLAND TO TAKE PLACE IN COMMEMORATIVE </p><p>EVENTS.  LINGUA BELIEVED TAURAN WOULD ACCEPT THE INVITATION, </p><p>BUT WOULD KEEP THE VISIT LOW-KEY AND TRY TO COMBINE IT WITH </p><p>PASTORAL VISITS TO CUBA\'S BELEAGUERED BISHOPS.  EMBASSY WILL </p><p>CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE TAURAN TO MEET WITH PAYA AND OTHER </p><p>DISSIDENTS IF SUCH A VISIT WERE TO TAKE PLACE.  WE NOTE FROM </p><p>LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS AS WELL AS REF B THAT CUBAN CARDINAL </p><p>JAIME ORTEGA RECENTLY LAMENTED PUBLICLY IN CUBA THE LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS SINCE THE POPE\'S VISIT, ASSERTING THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE SINCE 1998, THAT SOCIAL-POLITICAL SPACE </p><p>REMAINED LIMITED, AND THAT THE CHURCH CONTINUED TO BE </p><p>IGNORED. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00195 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
