The </p><p>overall situation, however, is being characterized as "very </p><p>uneasy" for the AKP government.  Some ministers, even though </p><p>they signed the decree that will be presented to parliament, </p><p>have already voiced their opposition by disclosing their </p><p>intent to cast "no" votes.  Papers also emphasize the </p><p>declaration of the Kurdish National Parliament meeting, </p><p>which denounced a possible Turkish military presence in </p><p>northern Iraq.  This is not going to help the AKP government </p><p>calm the opposition in parliament.  Mass appeal "Milliyet" </p><p>quotes military sources as saying that it might not be the </p><p>right time for the Turkish parliament to accept an American </p><p>military deployment because of the obvious anti-Turkish </p><p>sentiment of the Kurdish groups.  Islamic "Yeni Safak" </p><p>carries a banner headline: "The US will arm the Kurds," and </p><p>claims that heavily-armed Kurdish groups will use these </p><p>weapons against the Turkish military following a US </p><p>operation.  This is "part of the US plan" for an independent </p><p>Kurdish state, Yeni Safak argues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hurriyet" says that the three agreements, i.e. political, </p><p>military and economic, are virtually concluded and waiting </p><p>to be signed.  They will be signed right after the </p><p>parliamentary session, in other words, if the decision for </p><p>deployment is passed.  There are still some details to be </p><p>worked out, but Foreign Minister Yakis and Ambassador </p><p>Pearson said that significant progress had been achieved. </p><p>Reports say the remaining two issues involve the question of </p><p>IMF conditionality on the economic package and the status of </p><p>Turkomen in Northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commentaries on the unfolding developments are split.  Even </p><p>in the same paper, writers argued different sides of the </p><p>issue.  Hurriyet\'s Emin Colasan accused the government and </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan of complicating the situation and </p><p>creating confusion in the country.  He blamed the AKP </p><p>leadership for accepting US terms which he described as </p><p>"unacceptable."  Fatih Altayli, in the same paper, argued </p><p>that the rejection of the motion should be seen as a no- </p><p>confidence vote for the administration.  Cuneyt Ulsever </p><p>joined the debate by reminding, though 94 percent of the </p><p>Turkish people are opposed to war, the  deputies who are to </p><p>vote on the government\'s motion in the parliament will have </p><p>to decide what will be in Turkey\'s best interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  The visit of UNSG Annan to Ankara is the center of </p><p>attention in the Cyprus reporting.  Papers speculate that </p><p>Annan discussed his newly-revised Cyprus plan with the </p><p>Turkish leadership and received positive signals from </p><p>Ankara.  Annan is expected to make his new plan public after </p><p>presenting it to the Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders as he </p><p>visits the island today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p>"The fireball" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (2/26): </p><p>"The voting at the Turkish parliament, if it passes, will be </p><p>used by the war-mongering lobby as a pressuring tool against </p><p>members of the UN Security Council.  The lobby is in a </p><p>serious rush, because the chances for a peaceful settlement </p><p>are increasing every day. . The government obviously has put </p><p>the ball in the parliament\'s court.  Yet the Turkish </p><p>parliament must insist on international legitimacy, and wait </p><p>for a second UNSC resolution.  The war-mongering lobby in </p><p>Washington should be ignored, and Turkey is capable of </p><p>stopping this war from happening." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The post-Saddam situation" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(2/26): "The war is not going to take very long.  It will be </p><p>a short war, yet the aftermath will be very long.  Turkey </p><p>will have to maintain its military presence as long as US </p><p>soldiers remain there, which could be up to 5 years. </p><p>American soldiers to be stationed in Turkey could also </p><p>remain for years.  Turkey should be prepared for the worst, </p><p>such as Operation Provide Comfort, which requires </p><p>parliamentary authorization every three months. . The US </p><p>will not easily pull out of Iraq after the war.  Iraq will </p><p>be a main base for US activities, will ensure a safe flow of </p><p>oil, and permit the holding of `show\' elections.  Once </p><p>things are made stable in the eyes of the US, the </p><p>administration will be turned over to Iraqis, but definitely </p><p>not to the Baath Party.  That means that, in the meantime, </p><p>Turkey\'s immediate neighbor will be the US, not Iraq.  The </p><p>US plans will not end there.  The US will work to change the </p><p>administrations in Iran and Afghanistan as well as in </p><p>Central Asia, Syria and Saudi Arabia, a task which will </p><p>practically fill President Bush\'s 4-year agenda." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
