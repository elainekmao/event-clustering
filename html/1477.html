<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000343 </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/01 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE VIEW ON KABILA\'S APPARENT </p><p>ASSASSINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 08596 </p><p></p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF, </p><p>DELIVERED REFTEL TALKING POINTS TO THE ACTING PERMSEC IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR. NGONI </p><p>CHIDEYA THE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 17.  THE CHARGE PRESSED </p><p>OUR DESIRE FOR THE ADHERENCE TO THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT IN </p><p>THE WAKE OF THE APPARENT ASSASSINATION OF DRC PRESIDENT </p><p>KABILA AND THAT NO BELLIGERENT ATTEMPT TO TAKE MILITARY </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSED SITUATION.  DR. CHIDEYA </p><p>REITERATED ZIMBABWE\'S POSITION THAT IT WANTS TO SEE ALL </p><p>PARTIES ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TURNING TO THE ASSASSINATION, CHIDEYA STATED </p><p>THAT, ACCORDING TO THE VERSION OF EVENTS HE HAS HEARD, </p><p>KABILA WAS MEETING WITH HIS FINANCE MINISTER AROUND </p><p>2:30PM JANUARY 16 WHEN A "LIEUTENANT" MARCHED INTO THE </p><p>ROOM AND SHOT KABILA THREE TIMES AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. </p><p>THE ASSAILANT ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE THROUGH A WINDOW, BUT </p><p>KABILA\'S BODYGUARDS STORMED IN AND FATALLY SHOT THE </p><p>ASSASSIN.  KABILA WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL, WHERE HE DIED </p><p>LATER THAT DAY.  ONCE IT BECAME KNOWN KABILA WAS DEAD, </p><p>HIS CABINET MET TO APPOINT A TWO-MAN "PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>COMMITTEE" TO RUN THE COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO CHIDEYA. </p><p>THE COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF INTERIOR MINISTER GAETAN </p><p>KAKUDJI AND JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE KONGOLO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CHIDEYA REPORTED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS </p><p>CUTTING SHORT HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE FRANCO-AFRICAN </p><p>SUMMIT IN YAOUNDE TO RETURN TODAY TO HARARE TO DEAL WITH </p><p>THE DRC CRISIS.  BEFORE LEAVING YAOUNDE, MUGABE MET WITH </p><p>NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT SAM NUJOMA AND BOTH AGREED TO A MORE </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE MEETING BETWEEN KABILA\'S ALLIES.  THE </p><p>MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE "VERY SOON," ACCORDING TO </p><p>CHIDEYA.  THE GOZ IS LIKELY TO ISSUE A STATEMENT ON THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION TOMORROW MORNING (JANUARY 18), CHIDEYA </p><p>CONTINUED.  HE AFFIRMED THAT KABILA\'S BODY HAS BEEN </p><p>BROUGHT TO HARARE FOR AN AUTOPOSY AND EMBALMING.  IN A </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, THE MFA\'S DRC DESK </p><p>OFFICER, MAXWELL CHIKOROWONDO, REPORTED THAT, TO HIS </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, THE MEETING BETWEEN THE DRC ALLIES HAD NOT </p><p>YET BEEN ARRANGED, BUT PROBABLY WOULD BE ONCE MUGABE </p><p>RETURNED TO HARARE.  CHIKOROWONDO FLATLY DENIED RUMORS </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE IS SENDING MORE TROOPS TO KINSHASA TO </p><p>STABILIZE THE SITUATION THERE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE DRC DESK OFFICER STATED THAT KABILA\'S </p><p>CABINET IS IN CHARGE OF THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT, AND </p><p>THAT KABILA\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, BRIGADIER COLONEL KAPENDE, </p><p>IS NOT DIRECTING ANYTHING, BUT IS MERELY ACTING AS </p><p>SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITARY.  IF KAPENDE HAD BEEN BEHIND </p><p>THE ASSASSINATION, HE WOULD HAVE SURELY ANNOUNCED HIS </p><p>INTENTION TO TAKE OVER BY NOW, CHIKOROWONDO OPINED. </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS, HE STATED THAT NO </p><p>ONE REALLY STANDS OUT.  INTERIOR MINISTER KAKUDJI WAS </p><p>TOO CLOSE TO KABILA, HAS NO SUPPORT, AND IS TOO DESPISED </p><p>TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A CREDIBLE, LONG-TERM SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>KABILA, THE DESK OFFICER OFFERED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: CHIDEYA\'S COMMENTS PROVIDE THE FIRST </p><p>OFFICIAL ZIMBABWEAN CONFIRMATION THAT KABILA IS, IN </p><p>FACT, DEAD AND THAT HIS BODY IS IN HARARE.  WE ARE </p><p>INCLINED TO BELIEVE A VERSION OF EVENTS, REPORTED IN THE </p><p>PRESS AND ATTRIBUTED TO DEFENSE MINISTER MOVEN MAHACHI, </p><p>THAT KABILA DIED ON THE PLANE TO HARARE BECAUSE SHIPPING </p><p>A BODY HERE MAKES LITTLE SENSE.  THE GOZ, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THE MFA, HAS BEEN IN SOME DISARRAY WITH MUGABE AND MOST </p><p>SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  WE SHOULD BE </p><p>ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE GOZ\'S OFFICIAL STANCE AND ITS </p><p>INTENTIONS AFTER PRESIDENT MUGABE RETURNS TO HARARE, AS </p><p>SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE AWAITING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DECISIONS ON NEXT STEPS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p></p></div>
