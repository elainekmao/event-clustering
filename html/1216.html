(C)  SUMMARY: IN A JULY 10 MEETING WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) LEADER </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND MDC PARLIAMENTARY LEADER GIBSON </p><p>SIBANDA OUTLINED THE PARTY\'S PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES LAND REFORM, THE ECONOMY, AND THE CREATION OF </p><p>MECHANISMS FOR HOLDING THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE.  THE </p><p>PARTY WILL ALSO PUSH FOR THE REMOVAL OF WAR VETS FROM </p><p>FARMS, A WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC, AND A COMMISSION OF </p><p>INQUIRY INTO THE VIOLENCE SURROUNDING THE JUNE 24-25 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND WILL ADVOCATE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AIMED AT LIMITING EXECUTIVE </p><p>POWERS.  TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT IT IS JUST </p><p>AS WELL THAT HIS PARTY DID NOT WIN A MAJORITY OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS, SINCE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>DESTABILIZING.  THE MDC WILL CHALLENGE THE RESULTS OF A </p><p>NUMBER OF CONTESTS, INCLUDING TSVANGIRAI\'S OWN.  THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERS SAID THEY PLAN TO WORK HARD ON </p><p>TRANSFORMING THE MDC FROM A UNION-BASED OPPOSITION FRONT </p><p>TO A GENUINE POLITICAL PARTY.  THE MDC\'S AMBITIOUS </p><p>AGENDA IS TEMPERED BY REALISM ABOUT WHAT IT CAN ACHIEVE, </p><p>AND THE PARTY APPEARS WELL-POSITIONED TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>TOUGH PROBLEMS THAT LIE AHEAD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF, CALLED ON </p><p>MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI JULY 10.  TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY MDC VICE PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, WHO </p><p>WILL SERVE AS THE LEADER OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03779  01 OF 04  121802Z </p><p>"A FOOTHOLD IN DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED THE MDC LEADERS </p><p>FOR THE PARTY\'S STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE JUNE 24-25 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND APPLAUDED THE CONCILIATORY </p><p>STANCE THE PARTY HAS ADOPTED SINCE THE ELECTION DESPITE </p><p>ITS VALID CONCERNS ABOUT POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND </p><p>ELECTORAL IRREGULARITIES.  HE NOTED THAT THE PARTY\'S </p><p>RAPID SUCCESS -- OBTAINING ALMOST HALF OF THE CONTESTED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS ONLY NINE MONTHS AFTER ITS FOUNDING </p><p>   WAS INDEED MOST IMPRESSIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO </p><p>APPLAUDED THEIR COURAGE IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS THREATS </p><p>TO THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  TSVANGIRAI RESPONDED THAT THE MDC KNEW ALL </p><p>ALONG THAT IT WAS GOING INTO AN IMPERFECT ELECTION </p><p>PROCESS AND IS GRATIFIED TO HAVE OBTAINED A "FOOTHOLD IN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT."  HE SAID THAT IT IS HEALTHY FOR </p><p>THE COUNTRY THAT MDC DID NOT SCORE AN OUTRIGHT ELECTION </p><p>VICTORY, SINCE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTABILIZING.  THE </p><p>PARTY WILL LIKELY CHALLENGE THE RESULTS IN 20 TO 25 </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES WHERE IT KNOWS THAT RIGGING TOOK PLACE, </p><p>BUT IS STILL ASSESSING THE SITUATION.  IF THE MDC IS </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IN ENOUGH OF THE CHALLENGES TO OBTAIN A </p><p>MAJORITY, THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE HAD TIME TO ABSORB THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF AN MDC SUCCESS.  (NOTE:  ZANU-PF WON 62 </p><p>SEATS TO THE MDC\'S 57; PRESIDENT MUGABE IS ENTITLED TO </p><p>APPOINT 30 ADDITIONAL PARLIAMENTARIANS.  END NOTE.)  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERTURN </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS NOT ONLY IN ZIMBABWE BUT IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD; TSVANGIRAI ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03779  01 OF 04  121802Z </p><p>THAT THIS IS TRUE.  TSVANGIRAI ALSO NOTED THAT EVEN WITH </p><p>AN MDC PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY ZANU-PF WOULD STILL </p><p>CONTROL THE PRESIDENCY, AND THUS THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ASKED WHETHER HE WILL CONTEST HIS OWN LOST </p><p>RACE, TSVANGIRAI RESPONDED THAT HE PLANS TO DO SO, MORE </p><p>FOR THE SAKE OF SHOWING THE COUNTRY THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>COMMITTED ELECTORAL FRAUD THERE THAN TO OBTAIN A SEAT IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  WITHOUT A SEAT, HE SAID, HE WILL HAVE MORE </p><p>TIME TO FOCUS ON PARTY MATTERS.  HE ADDED THAT HE DID </p><p>NOT REGRET HAVING CONTESTED IN A RURAL AREA RATHER THAN </p><p>IN AN URBAN AREA WHERE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHOO-IN, </p><p>SINCE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MDC\'S </p><p>SUPPORT IS NOT SIMPLY AN URBAN OR LABOR PHENOMENON. </p><p>DESPITE HIS OWN LOSS, THE NATIONWIDE RESULTS HAVE BORNE </p><p>THIS OUT; THE MDC, FOR EXAMPLE, WON A MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>VOTE IN BOTH MATABELELAND NORTH AND SOUTH PROVINCES AND </p><p>ABOUT HALF THE VOTE IN THE RURAL PROVINCE OF MANICALAND. </p><p>THE TWO AREAS WHERE THE MDC PERFORMED MOST POORLY, HE </p><p>CONTINUED, WERE MASHONALAND EAST AND MASHONALAND </p><p>CENTRAL, WHERE THE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>WERE HIGHEST.  THE MDC ARGUES, THEREFORE, THAT IT IS THE </p><p>"ONLY NATIONAL PARTY," CUTTING ACROSS TRIBE AND REGION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WITH THE MDC\'S SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3070 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03779  02 OF 04  121802Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------6D57CA  121802Z /38 </p><p>P 121809Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6583 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE MDC HAS NO </p><p>PLANS TO JOIN A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY, SINCE </p><p>DOING SO WOULD "DESTROY THIS WHOLE EMBRYONIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT" OF ZIMBABWEAN MULTIPARTYISM.  "WE THINK </p><p>IT\'S IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE OPPOSITION IS THE OPPOSITION."  TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED </p><p>THAT PEOPLE (I.E. ZANU-PF) ARE TRYING TO COOPT MDC </p><p>MEMBERS TO DESTROY THEIR CREDIBILITY, BUT THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT, IN SPITE OF </p><p>THIS, HE ASSUMED THAT THE MDC WOULD WORK WITH ZANU-PF IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  "OF COURSE," TSVANGIRAI REPLIED. </p><p> </p><p>MDC PRIORITIES: ACCOUNTABILITY, THE ECONOMY, AND LAND </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE MDC </p><p>PLANS TO FOCUS ON TWO BROAD OBJECTIVES AFTER PARLIAMENT </p><p>BEGINS.  THE PARTY\'S FIRST GOAL IS TO GET ZANU-PF TO </p><p>"OPEN THE BOOKS" IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY NOT ONLY FINANCIALLY BUT IN ALL AREAS OF </p><p>GOVERNANCE.  THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO WORK TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIZE THE PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE TWO SPECIFIC ISSUES THE MDC WILL ADDRESS </p><p>  FIRST, TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, ARE THE ECONOMY </p><p>  AND LAND.  ZIMBABWE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT CAN ACCESS </p><p>  THE LAND REFORM FUNDS THAT THE DONORS HAVE PROMISED. </p><p>  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT REESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW </p><p>  AND ENSURING A TRANSPARENT PROCESS WILL BE THE KEY TO </p><p>  THIS.  DONORS WANT TO BE HELPFUL, BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE </p><p>  IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE.  THE AMBASSADOR AND TSVANGIRAI </p><p>  AGREED THAT REMOVING THE WAR VETS FROM THE FARMS WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03779  02 OF 04  121802Z </p><p>  BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD REESTABLISHING A CLIMATE WHERE </p><p>- MEANINGFUL LAND REFORM CAN BE DISCUSSED.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>  SAID THAT, IF ANYTHING, THE SITUATION ON THE FARMS SEEMS </p><p>  TO BE GETTING WORSE.  WHEREAS BEFORE FARMERS WERE </p><p>  ALLOWED TO WORK THEIR LAND WHILE IT WAS OCCUPIED, NOW </p><p>  THEY ARE BEING DRIVEN OFF.  THE FARM OCCUPATIONS, </p><p>  TSAVANGIRAI CONTINUED, ARE MUGABE\'S "OBSESSION," BUT </p><p>  THERE IS NO CONSENSUS IN THE CABINET SUPPORTING THIS </p><p>  POLICY.  WHETHER THE MDC CAN EFFECTIVELY PRESS FOR A </p><p>  RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE IN PARLIAMENT, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, </p><p>  HAS YET TO BE TESTED. </p><p> </p><p>  9.  (C)  THE ECONOMY, TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED, CANNOT </p><p>  CONTINUE IN ITS CURRENT STATE OF "MELTDOWN."  HE NOTED </p><p>  THAT A MAJOR PAPER PRODUCTS FACTORY IN BULAWAYO HAD </p><p>  CLOSED ON JULY 7 DUE TO A LACK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY. </p><p>  TSVANGIRAI AND SIBANDA POINTED TO A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT </p><p>  MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE THE ECONOMY CAN BE REINVIGORATED, </p><p>  INCLUDING ENDING THE FARM OCCUPATIONS, GETTING </p><p>  CORRUPTION UNDER CONTROL, AND WITHDRAWING ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>  TROOPS FROM THE DRC (SEE PARA 18).  THE MDC WILL TRY TO </p><p>  CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY SURROUNDING PUBLIC ACCOUNTS, </p><p>  PRIVATIZATION, AND LAND. </p><p> </p><p>  10.  (C)  EARLY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION, SIBANDA </p><p>  SAID, THE MDC WILL CALL FOR A FULL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY </p><p>  INTO THE PRE- AND POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE.  ZANU-PF WILL </p><p>  TRY TO RESIST THIS, BUT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE THE MDC </p><p>  IS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT THE </p><p>  MDC IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO ASSIST </p><p>  THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE.  THE PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03779  02 OF 04  121802Z </p><p>  IS SEEKING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT. </p><p>  ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE WILL BE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM, </p><p>  WITH A FOCUS ON SHIFTING SOME PRESIDENTIAL POWERS TO </p><p>  PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED THE MDC LEADERS THAT </p><p>THE USG IS CURRENTLY FUNDING A PROGRAM FOR PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>CAPACITY BUILDING CONDUCTED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>NEW YORK AT ALBANY, WHICH HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL SINCE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1999.   HE URGED THE PARTY\'S PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM.  EVEN BEFORE THE MDC\'S </p><p>STRONG PERFORMANCE BROUGHT MULTIPARTYISM TO PARLIAMENT, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, THE USG HAD IDENTIFIED PARLIAMENT </p><p>AS A PROMISING VEHICLE FOR POSITIVE CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUING VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>THE CURRENT LEVEL OF VIOLENCE, TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT </p><p>VIOLENCE ON FARMS BY WAR VETERANS IS CONTINUING.  IN A </p><p>NUMBER OF FARMS IN THE MARONDERA AND MACHEKE AREAS OF </p><p>MASHONALAND EAST PROVINCE, SUPERVISORY FARM WORKERS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ROUNDED UP AND BEATEN.  THE PERPETRATORS ARE </p><p>LOYALISTS OF WAR VET LEADER HITLER HUNZVI.  IN MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE, PEOPLE ARE RANDOMLY INVADING FARMS, ACCORDING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3071 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03779  03 OF 04  121803Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------6D57D4  121803Z /38 </p><p>P 121809Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6584 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

HE ALSO NOTED THAT SOLDIERS HAVE GONE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03779  03 OF 04  121803Z </p><p>HARARE AREAS PERCEIVED AS MDC STRONGHOLDS AND BEATEN UP </p><p>LOCAL RESIDENTS.  "THE VIOLENCE," TSVANGIRAI SUMMARIZED, </p><p>"IS NOT EBBING."  (NOTE: OTHER SOURCES CONFIRM THESE </p><p>CONTINUED FARM OCCUPATIONS AND BEATINGS OF MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  END NOTE.)  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED BY </p><p>INDICATING THAT THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE VERY </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AND IS </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ISSUE CLOSELY.  "WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK </p><p>OUT ABOUT THE MATTER," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>FOCUS TURNS TO PARTY-BUILDING AND LOCAL ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  TSVANGIRAI ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>THE MDC FACES A CHALLENGING TASK IN TRANSFORMING THE MDC </p><p>FROM A LABOR-BASED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT TO A GENUINE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY.  SINCE ITS CREATION, THE MDC HAS BEEN </p><p>OPERATING WITH INTERIM STRUCTURES, SUCH AS LOCAL </p><p>BRANCHES AND PROVINCIAL COMMITTEES, THAT ARE MOSTLY </p><p>BASED ON ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNION (ZCTU) </p><p>STRUCTURES.  GIVEN THE PARTY\'S BROAD BASE, THERE WILL </p><p>INEVITABLY BE TENSIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTY ELEMENTS. </p><p>THE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS IS TO HAVE DIALOGUE WITHIN THE </p><p>PARTY, WITH WIDE PARTICIPATION, ABOUT WHAT THE MDC IS TO </p><p>STAND FOR AND HOW COMPETING INTERESTS CAN BE ADDRESSED. </p><p>ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR HOW THE MDC WILL ATTEMPT TO </p><p>DELIVER TO ITS CONSTITUENTS GIVEN ITS LACK OF ACCESS TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT COFFERS, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED THAT HE DOES NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT MDC SUPPORTERS EXPECT DELIVERY OF TANGIBLES </p><p>SUCH AS ROADS.  RATHER, THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW WELL </p><p>THE PARTY IS ADVOCATING THEIR INTERESTS.  ONCE THE MDC </p><p>WINS SOME MAYORAL POSITIONS, IT WILL BE ABLE TO START </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03779  03 OF 04  121803Z </p><p>DELIVERING.  (NOTE: THREE KEY MAYORAL POSITIONS ARE TO </p><p>BE FILLED IN HARARE, BULAWAYO, AND MASVINGO IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE.  THE MDC PLANS TO ACTIVELY CONTEST ALL OF THEM. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  WHEN PEOPLE VOTED FOR THE MDC, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>SAID, THEY VOTED FOR CHANGE, WHICH IS "NOT AN EVENT BUT </p><p>A PROCESS."  THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WERE JUST THE </p><p>FIRST PHASE.  THE MDC HAS ALREADY BEGUN FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>NEXT PHASE, THE AS YET UNSCHEDULED LOCAL ELECTIONS.  THE </p><p>PARTY PLANS TO CONTEST A LARGE NUMBER OF MAYORAL POSTS </p><p>AND OTHER LOCAL POSITIONS.  TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT HE </p><p>PLANS TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 2002 </p><p>(ASSUMING, HE TOOK CARE TO ADD, THAT HE IS SELECTED BY </p><p>PARTY STRUCTURES). </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  CLAIMS THAT THE MDC HAS RECEIVED MASSIVE </p><p>FOREIGN FUNDING ARE FALSE, TSVANGIRAI SAID.  WITH ALMOST </p><p>FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE, THE MDC IS NOW ELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>PUBLIC FUNDING UNDER THE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE ACT. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE FUNDS WILL ACTUALLY </p><p>BE AVAILABLE.  ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR WHETHER THE MDC </p><p>PLANS TO ESTABLISH LINKS WITH OTHER SMALL PARTIES THAT </p><p>DID NOT FARE WELL IN THE ELECTIONS, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED </p><p>THAT THE ELECTIONS HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE MDC IS THE </p><p>ONLY SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION FORCE IN ZIMBABWE.  MEMBERS </p><p>OF OTHER PARTIES ARE, HOWEVER, WELCOME TO COME INTO THE </p><p>MDC.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT PEOPLE WISHING TO COME TO THE </p><p>MDC FROM OTHER PARTIES WILL BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE MDC\'S </p><p>PRINCIPLES TO ENSURE THAT THEY SHARE THE PARTY\'S VALUES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03779  03 OF 04  121803Z </p><p>MDC\'S VIEWS OF CURRENT STATE OF ZANU-PF </p><p>16.  (C)  TSVANGIRAI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF POWER STRUGGLES CURRENTLY </p><p>UNDERWAY IN ZANU-PF.  ONCE THEY HAVE PLAYED THEMSELVES </p><p>OUT, IT WILL BE EASIER TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S FUTURE.  HE SAID THAT THE NEW CABINET, AS YET </p><p>UNNAMED, IS LIKELY TO BE "A MIXTURE OF OLD GUARD </p><p>RESISTANCE AND SO-CALLED NEW BLOOD FRUSTRATION."

THE PARTY HAS SET AN </p><p>AMBITIOUS AGENDA IN PARLIAMENT, BUT SEEMS TO BE </p><p>REALISTIC ABOUT HOW MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI AND SIBANDA ALSO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IMPORTANCE, AND DIFFICULTY,-OF PARTY-BUILDING.
