<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB/IFD </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON PROGRESS ON IMF REVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3536 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IMF ResRep (strictly protect) told us late today </p><p>that he was not thrilled with the GOT\'s rate of progress </p><p>toward meeting the conditions for the upcoming Fifth Review </p><p>of the program.  He expressed doubt that the government would </p><p>be able to complete all of the outstanding work in time for </p><p>the Fund Board to meet this month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On the fiscal side, Treasury U/S Ibrahim Canakci </p><p>told us June 5 that the bureaucracy had identified measures </p><p>to close most of this year\'s projected gap, but still had to </p><p>present those measures to the Prime Minister for "reaction." </p><p>Meanwhile, he and his staff continue to work with other </p><p>Ministries, including the Energy Ministry, to identify </p><p>additional measures.  IMF ResRep was slightly more negative. </p><p>He said the May figures (which came in June 5) for the </p><p>Central Government budget were "pretty bad," confirming a </p><p>problematic fiscal trend.  His understanding is that the </p><p>measures the government has identified so far would close </p><p>only one-half of the fiscal gap.  However, the government </p><p>also has announced cutting taxes on cars (to spur domestic </p><p>demand) and reducing electricity prices for exporters. All in </p><p>all, ResRep believes the Fund and GOT are still some distance </p><p>away from completing the fiscal side of the LOI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On the structural side, Canakci said the government </p><p>had decided to put some priority legislation on Turkey\'s </p><p>version of the "fast track" (by making them "fundamental </p><p>laws").  As of June 5, Parliament was discussing this </p><p>approach for the critical legislation affecting Turkey\'s </p><p>three social security funds.  He predicted (correctly) that </p><p>Parliament would pass the Foreign Investment Law that </p><p>evening, and noted that it was moving ahead on bankruptcy and </p><p>other legislation.  IMF ResRep noted that the Fund and GOT </p><p>had not yet agreed on the "arrears rescheduling" language in </p><p>the social security legislation.  Here, the Fund is insisting </p><p>that the legislation make clear that any rescheduling of </p><p>arrears would not be generalized.  ResRep confirmed that the </p><p>GOT was making good progress on the eight structural </p><p>benchmarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Canakci (privately) and State Minister Babacan </p><p>(publicly) both continue to express hope that the review can </p><p>be completed this month, although both acknowledged the </p><p>possibility of a delay.  As noted above, ResRep thinks a </p><p>Board meeting by end-June is increasingly unlikely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
