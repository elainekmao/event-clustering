<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001364 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: NOTIONAL CALENDAR FOR ERDOGAN\'S ASSUMPTION </p><p>OF THE PRIME MINISTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) AK leader Erdogan is a candidate for Parliament in the </p><p>special March 9 election in Siirt province.  Assuming he wins </p><p>a seat in the legislature, the election will serve as a </p><p>prelude to his eventually assuming the role of prime minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The following notional calendar represents our </p><p>understanding of the procedural steps, reflecting Turkish law </p><p>and custom, that are involved.  The timeline below is also </p><p>notional, reflecting the earliest possible date on which </p><p>Erdogan could take office as P.M., that is, mid-March. </p><p>Notably, Erdogan over the March 1-2 weekend signaled publicly </p><p>that he would not/not seek to take over in the immediate </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- March 9: Election in Siirt.  Erdogan wins a seat; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- March 10-12: Erdogan receives document of registration </p><p>(mazbata) declaring his status as an elected M.P.; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- March 11-13: Erdogan sworn in at Parliament, formally </p><p>assumes his duties as M.P; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- March 13-14: Resignation of P.M. Gul accepted by President </p><p>Sezer, who then designates Erdogan to form a (59th) </p><p>government; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- March 14-15: If President Sezer immediately gives the </p><p>mandate to Erdogan to form a government, the cabinet list </p><p>will likely be presented to the Presidency within two days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Sezer\'s Calendar </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) There is no constitutionally defined timetable under </p><p>which the president would make decisions regarding the </p><p>inauguration of a next (Erdogan-led) government, but the </p><p>process will likely run as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- President approves the new cabinet list and sends it to </p><p>Parliament.  From that moment on, Erdogan would be regarded </p><p>officially as prime minister; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The cabinet list is formally read to Parliament; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Within one week, the P.M. reads the new government\'s </p><p>program; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Vote of confidence debates in Parliament will begin two </p><p>(full) days after the reading of the program; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Vote of confidence held one (full) day after the debate </p><p>closes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Possible Surprises </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Sezer is a staunch Kemalist with a heightened, </p><p>Javert-like sense of legalistic propriety.  He could </p><p>introduce unexpected elements into the government formation </p><p>process -- partly, we expect, to signal to Erdogan that the </p><p>President and other organs of the State will be watching the </p><p>government very closely.  Moreover, while by tradition the </p><p>president gives the mandate to form a government to the </p><p>leader of the party with the most seats in Parliament, he is </p><p>not legally obliged to do so.  The president\'s traditional </p><p>obligation here is simply to give the mandate to someone who </p><p>could win a vote of confidence in the legislature. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
