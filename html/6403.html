(S) When Sochiratna arrived to meet A/POL later on March </p><p>16, he passed over a single piece of paper on which the </p><p>following was printed. Begin quote: </p><p> </p><p>1. Twenty Russian missile technicians arrived in Baghdad on </p><p>March 9, 2003.  All of them hold Russian diplomatic passports. </p><p> </p><p>2. They are not regular staff members of the Russian embassy. </p><p> </p><p>3. They travel in cars with Russian diplomatic license plates </p><p>(No. 55).

(C) On a separate issue, Sochiratna also passed on that 38 </p><p>Thai students who are studying at Saddam University and </p><p>living in dorms there have decided to remain and not take </p><p>advantage of the Embassy-organized evacuation.  He said that </p><p>most of these students are from poor areas of southern </p><p>Thailand and are afraid that if they leave Baghdad now, they </p><p>will never have the chance to finish their studies. </p><p>Sochiratna asked that we convey to the appropriate U.S. </p><p>authorities the fact that these Thai nationals remain at the </p><p>university. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
