<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY TRYING TO SUPPORT THE MIDDLE EAST ROADMAP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3507 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Since late May, numerous meetings with GOT officials </p><p>and press reports suggest Turkey is seeking to develop a </p><p>constructive approach on Middle East issues, offering to host </p><p>an MEPP (and a separate OIC) conference in Turkey and sending </p><p>appropriate, reform-minded messages to Iran and Syria </p><p>(reftel).  PM Erdogan recently spoke with Israeli PM Sharon </p><p>and Palestinian PM Abu Mazen to encourage them to pursue </p><p>their peace efforts and to indicate Turkey\'s willingness to </p><p>assist.  In response, Israeli PM Sharon indicated an interest </p><p>in arranging a Roadmap meeting in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In recent meetings with us, Erdogan, FM Gul, and TGS </p><p>Chief Gen. Ozkok, indicated that Turkey wants to work with </p><p>the U.S. in the Middle East.  Israeli foreign and defense </p><p>ministers recently visited Turkey while President Katzav is </p><p>expected here in July.  Announcement of a pending visit to </p><p>the region by Gul, with a follow-on visit this autumn by </p><p>Erdogan currently under discussion, comes as MFA </p><p>Undersecretary Ambassador Ugur Ziyal visits Washington to </p><p>discuss ways to rebuild the U.S.-Turkey relationship.  In a </p><p>recent public address, FM Gul stressed the GOT\'s intention to </p><p>continue good relations with Israel and the Palestinians and </p><p>contribute to the process toward peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>The Roadmap and the Arafat Question </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nevertheless, there are still some discordant notes. </p><p>GOT officials balk at freezing out Arafat, whom they still </p><p>regard as the democratically elected head of the Palestinian </p><p>"state."  The immediate effect of this is a Turkish impulse </p><p>to consider meetings not only with GOI officials and Abu </p><p>Mazen, but Arafat as well.  Gul\'s Special Advisor at the MFA </p><p>Gurcan Turkoglu told us it is important to maintain Abu </p><p>Mazen\'s support among Palestinians and not create a separate </p><p>pole of support around Arafat through strict isolation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We have let our political and MFA contacts know </p><p>clearly a meeting with Arafat would be seen negatively by the </p><p>USG.  The Turkish response has been ambiguous.  Publicly </p><p>unraveling the GOT dilemma, Muharrem Sarikaya, a leading </p><p>columnist in the establishmentarian "Hurriyet" newspaper, </p><p>wrote that Turkey "could not exclude Arafat from the peace </p><p>process, but hoped he would withdraw" on his own accord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In a recent meeting with us, MFA Middle East DG Safak </p><p>Gokturk replied that Turkey is aware of USG concerns but will </p><p>"do what (it) will do." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Other conversations suggest the new perspective from above </p><p>may not yet have filtered down to others.  Ruling AK Party </p><p>M.P.s queried whether it would be feasible to meet Abu Mazen </p><p>and Arafat simultaneously; Justice Minister Cemil Cicek, the </p><p>government\'s spokesman, expressed surprise to us about that </p><p>the U.S. would react negatively if Turkish leaders visited </p><p>Arafat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turkey wants to work with the USG on regional issues. </p><p>Nevertheless, the difficulty with changing traditional views </p><p>of Arafat reflects Turkey\'s own calculations about realities </p><p>on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
