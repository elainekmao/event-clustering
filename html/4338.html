<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 008305 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM ROBERT S. DEUTSCH; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) COMBATING TERRORISM HAS LONG BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY (GOT).  IN ITS EARLY AND STRONG SUPPORT </p><p>OF THE COALITION IN THE GLOBAL WAR AGAINST TERROR AND ITS </p><p>SUBSEQUENT TAKING-OVER OF ISAF LEADERSHIP, THE GOT HAS </p><p>REAFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE TARGETED TURKS AND FOREIGNERS, </p><p>OCCASIONALLY INCLUDING USG PERSONNEL, FOR OVER 40 YEARS. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN </p><p>TURKEY INCLUDE MARXIST-LENINIST, RADICAL ISLAMIST, </p><p>SEPARATIST, AND PRO-CHECHEN.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE THREATS, </p><p>GOT HAS DEVELOPED BOTH STRONG DETERMINATION AND THE </p><p>CAPABILITY TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  TURKEY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE USG\'S INTERNATIONAL, COORDINATED APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TURKEY\'S INTERNAL </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ALTERED THEIR OPERATING PROCEDURES. </p><p>WITH THE WORLD PUBLIC OPINION STRONGLY AGAINST TERRORISM AND </p><p>THE GLOBAL COALITION INCREASING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, </p><p>THESE ORGANIZATIONS ENTERED INTO A PERIOD OF LITTLE OR NO </p><p>ACTION.  ACTING AS INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS, MANY OF THESE </p><p>GROUPS HAVE REVERTED TO RECRUITMENT OF SUPPORTERS AND </p><p>STRATEGY PLANNING. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ON OCTOBER 8, 1997, THE SECRETARY OF STATE NAMED THE </p><p>SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK) AND THE </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S PARTY/FRONT (DHKP/C, </p><p>FORMERLY KNOWN AS REVOLUTIONARY LEFT, DEV-SOL), MAKING THEM </p><p>SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT </p><p>OF 1996.  ON OCTOBER 11, 2001, THE SECRETARY OF STATE RENEWED </p><p>THOSE DESIGNATIONS FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS.  (THE PKK HAS SINCE </p><p>CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE KURDISTAN FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY </p><p>CONGRESS, KADEK.) </p><p> </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) THE MAIN RADICAL-LEFT TERROR ORGANIZATION, DHKP/C, </p><p>CONDUCTS SMALL-SCALE OPERATIONS AGAINST TURKS AND FOREIGNERS </p><p>ALIKE (ARMED ATTACKS ON UNIFORMED POLICE, SUICIDE AND OTHER </p><p>BOMBINGS, ASSASSINATIONS).  THIS ORGANIZATION HAS NOT </p><p>CONDUCTED ANY MAJOR EVENTS WITHIN TURKEY IN 2002, ALTHOUGH IT </p><p>CONTINUES TO ORGANIZE ITSELF, PREDOMINANTLY WITHIN EUROPE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, DHKP/C COOPERATES WITH </p><p>OTHER GROUPS IN EUROPE BY PROVIDING SUPPORT, SHELTER, AND </p><p>ARMS TO EACH OTHER\'S ORGANIZATIONS.  TURKISH AUTHORITIES </p><p>SEIZED DHKP/C WEAPONS FROM A CAR AT THE KAPIKULE BORDER IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002.  THESE WEAPONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN </p><p>OPERATIONS CAUSING DISTURBANCES PRIOR TO THE TURKISH NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS HELD IN NOVEMBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) OTHER FAR-LEFT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS STILL ACTIVE </p><p>INCLUDE THE TURKISH COMMUNIST PARTY/MARXIST-LENINIST </p><p>(TKP/ML), THE TURKISH WORKERS\' AND PEASANTS LIBERATION ARMY </p><p>(TIKKO), AND THE MARXIST-LENINIST COMMUNIST PARTY (MLKP). </p><p>TKP/ML AND TIKKO PRIMARILY OPERATE IN THE AREAS OF ORDU, </p><p>TOKAT, AND SAMSUN.  MLKP CONDUCTS SMALL-SCALE TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS, USUALLY USING PIPE BOMBS, WITHIN METROPOLITAN </p><p>AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIST </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THE PRIME, RADICAL ISLAMIST TERROR GROUP OF TURKEY IS </p><p>THE TURKISH HIZBULLAH.  ALTHOUGH KNOWN TO FIGHT RIVALS, </p><p>NAMELY THE PKK AND OTHER RIVAL ISLAMIC GROUPS, IN FAVOR OF </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, TURKISH HIZBULLAH HAS NOT </p><p>CARRIED OUT ANY MAJOR OPERATIONS IN 2002.  IT STAGED A </p><p>SPECTACULAR JANUARY 2001 AMBUSH IN DIYARBAKIR THAT TOOK THE </p><p>LIFE OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR OKKAN AND FIVE OF </p><p>HIS BODYGUARDS.  TWO UNDERCOVER POLICE WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER </p><p>HIZBULLAH ATTACK IN OCTOBER 2001.  ACCORDING TO STATE </p><p>AUTHORITIES, HIZBULLAH CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS ACTIVITIES </p><p>ON A THEORETICAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) OTHER ISLAMIC GROUPS INCLUDE THE GREAT EASTERN </p><p>RAIDER\'S FRONT (IBDA-C), FEDERAL ISLAMIC STATE OF ANATOLIA </p><p>(KAPLANCILAR), SELAM GROUP, ISLAMIC MOVEMENT ORGANIZATION </p><p>(IHO), THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, SELEFILER, SOFULAR, AND </p><p>BEYYIAT-I EL-IMAM.  BOTH IBDA-C AND BEYYIAT-I EL-IMAM ARE </p><p>KNOWN TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO AL QAIDA. </p><p> </p><p>SEPARATIST </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) KADEK, FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE PKK, REPRESENTS THE </p><p>LARGEST SEPARATIST ORGANIZATION GROUP IN TURKEY, THOUGH ITS </p><p>CAPABILITY TO OPERATE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY REDUCED DUE TO </p><p>VIGOROUS AND ON-GOING COUNTER-INSURGENCY EFFORTS OF THE </p><p>TURKISH ARMED FORCES, JANDARMA, TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE </p><p>(TNP), AND VILLAGE GUARDS (A PARAMILITARY GUARD FORCE </p><p>RECRUITED FROM LOCAL VILLAGERS).  THIS EFFORT ULTIMATELY LED </p><p>TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN IN </p><p>1999.  THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DESIGNATED THE PKK A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION IN MAY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) IN APRIL 2002 THE GROUP UNDERWENT A RE-ORGANIZATION </p><p>AND NAME CHANGE.  RENAMED THE KURDISTAN FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY </p><p>CONGRESS (KADEK), THE ORGANIZATION HAS EXPANDED ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS BY FOCUSING UPON MORE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.  KADEK </p><p>RETAINS THE SAME SYMBOL AND PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP </p><p>OF THE PKK, THOUGH IT HAS EXPANDED THIS COUNCIL TO ELEVEN </p><p>INSTEAD OF NINE MEMBERS.  ACCORDING TO TURKISH GOVERNMENT </p><p>EXPERTS AND NGOS, KADEK ALSO MAINTAINS APPROXIMATELY </p><p>500-ARMED MILITANTS IN TURKEY AND UP TO 5000 ARMED MILITANTS </p><p>IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  WHILE THE ORGANIZATION LARGELY CONTINUES </p><p>TO FOLLOW THE PKK\'S SELF-PROCLAIMED SEPTEMBER 1, 1999, </p><p>CEASE-FIRE, IT HAS ISSUED WARNINGS VIA SUPPORTIVE NEWSPAPERS </p><p>OF FUTURE ARMED ATTACKS IF CERTAIN ACTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN. </p><p>SMALL CELLS AND SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN THROUGHOUT TURKEY, BUT </p><p>THESE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED TO THE POINT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, RATHER THAN THE MILITARY, OVERSEE MOST OPERATIONS </p><p>AND INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>CHECHENS IN TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN APRIL 2002, MUSTAFA YILMAZ SEIZED THE MARMARA </p><p>HOTEL IN ISTANBUL AND HELD 13 HOSTAGES FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>TWENTY MINUTES UNTIL HE SURRENDERED WITHOUT INCIDENT. </p><p>YILMAZ, WHO IS OF CHECHEN ORIGIN, IS BELIEVED TO HAVE STAGED </p><p>THE RAID TO PROTEST RUSSIAN ACTIONS IN CHECHNYA.  HE IS </p><p>PRESENTLY IN CUSTODY AND ON TRIAL IN THE ISTANBUL BEYOGLU </p><p>SECOND HEAVY CRIMINAL COURT UNDER A VARIETY OF CHARGES, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NOT UNDER TURKEY\'S TOUGH ANTI-TERROR LAW.  THIS </p><p>FOLLOWS AN APRIL 22, 2001, SEIZURE OF ISTANBUL\'S SWISS HOTEL </p><p>BY 13 PRO-CHECHEN TURKISH CITIZENS WHO HELD 150 HOSTAGES, </p><p>INCLUDING 37 AMERICANS, FOR APPROXIMATELY 12 HOURS.  LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF TURKS, MANY WITH ROOTS IN THE CAUCASUS, ARE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO CHECHEN AMBITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) THE CAPITALIZED TITLES BELOW CORRESPOND TO REFTEL </p><p>QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>GOT ACTIONS SUPPORTING THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p>(A) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) TURKISH SUPPORT FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>CEMENTED GOT\'S COMMITTED POLICY ON FIGHTING TERROR.  GOT </p><p>ISSUED STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING THE ATTACKS.  IN </p><p>THE FACE OF STRONG PUBLIC OPPOSITION, PARLIAMENT, UNDER THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF PM ECEVIT, PASSED A RESOLUTION ALLOWING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SEND TURKISH TROOPS ABROAD AND TO PERMIT THE </p><p>STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS ON TURKISH SOIL IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF).  TURKEY WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>FIRST COUNTRIES TO CONTRIBUTE FORCES TO ISAF AND ASSUMED THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP ROLE IN JUNE 2002. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) THE ARREST OF THREE AL QAIDA SUSPECTS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEASTERN CITY OF VAN IN FEBRUARY 2002 AND ONE IN ISTANBUL </p><p>IN AUGUST 2002 HIGHLIGHT TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) </p><p>EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  FIRAS SULEYMAN, YUSUF SALIM </p><p>HUSAYN, AND AHMAD MAHMUD WERE ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH </p><p>ENTERING TURKEY ILLEGALLY VIA IRAN IN FEBRUARY 2002.  MEMBERS </p><p>OF BAYT AL-IMAM, A JORDANIAN GROUP WITH CLOSE TIES TO AL </p><p>QAIDA, THE THREE MEN WERE FOUND TO HAVE MET AND RECEIVED </p><p>MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM USAMA BIN LADEN AND HAD BEEN PLANNING </p><p>BOMBING ATTACKS ON ISRAELI AND US TARGETS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> THESE MEN WERE RETURNED TO JORDAN IN SEPTEMBER 2002.  AHMET </p><p>ABDULLAH WAS ARRESTED IN ISTANBUL IN AUGUST 2002 AFTER AN </p><p>OPERATION CONDUCTED BY THE ISTANBUL SECURITY FORCES BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIS LINKS TO BAYT AL-IMAM. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) TURKEY HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH UN SECURITY RESOLUTION </p><p>1373, RATIFYING ALL UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON COMBATING </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAVE FROZEN THE ASSETS </p><p>OF THOSE TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, PERSONS, AND ENTITIES FOUND </p><p>ON UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS BY ISSUING A DECREE TO </p><p>FREEZE ALL FUNDS AND RELATED ASSETS.  THE INITIAL DECREE, NO. </p><p>2001/2483, DATED DECEMBER 22, 2001, HAS BEEN UPDATED BY NO. </p><p>2002/3873, DATED MARCH 21, 2002, AND NO. 2002/4206, DATED MAY </p><p>16, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM (B) </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) STATE SECURITY COURTS (DGM) IN EIGHT PROVINCES, WITH </p><p>JURISDICTION FOR ALL CRIMES THAT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF </p><p>THE ANTI-TERROR LAW, TAKE A VIGOROUS APPROACH TOWARDS </p><p>PROSECUTING TERROR-RELATED CRIMES.    AVERAGE TRIAL TIMES RUN </p><p>MORE THAN A YEAR, AND DEFENDANTS ARE USUALLY INCARCERATED </p><p>DURING THEIR TRIALS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) ABDULLAH OCALAN, THE LEADER OF THE PKK CONVICTED OF </p><p>TREASON IN JUNE 1999 AND SENTENCED TO DEATH.  FOLLOWING THE </p><p>EU REFORM PACKAGE PASSED BY THE TURKISH GRAND NATIONAL </p><p>PARLIAMENT IN AUGUST 2002 OUTLAWING THE DEATH PENALTY, </p><p>OCALAN\'S SENTENCE WAS CONVERTED TO LIFE IN PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (C/D) </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) IN 2002, THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY DID NOT SEEK THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON </p><p>TERROR-RELATED CHARGES, NOR DID THE UNITED STATES SEEK THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUCH SUSPECTS FROM TURKEY.  THERE ARE NO </p><p>IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) IN THE PAST, TURKEY HAS FACED DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>EXTRADITING TERROR-RELATED SUSPECTS FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, TURKEY HAS REQUESTED THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF 245 HIGH LEVEL ADMINISTRATORS FOR TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS SINCE 1991.  SYMPATHY WITH KURDISH POLITICAL </p><p>AND CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN STATES, ALLEGATIONS </p><p>OF TORTURE BY TURKISH OFFICIALS, AND TURKEY\'S LEGAL PROVISION </p><p>FOR THE DEATH PENALTY HAVE ALL PROVED IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCH </p><p>EXTRADITIONS.  HOWEVER, IN AUGUST 2002, AS A PART OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION REFORM PACKAGE, THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT PASSED </p><p>A LAW BANNING THE USE OF THE DEATH PENALTY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION (E) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) TURKS SEE THEMSELVES TO BE AMONG THE WORLD\'S PRIMARY </p><p>VICTIMS OF TERRORISM.  THEY CITE THE 15-YEAR INSURGENCY OF </p><p>THE KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK), AND THE WORLDWIDE </p><p>ASSASSINATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE TURKISH DIPLOMATS AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES BY ARMENIAN ACTIVISTS OF THE 1970S AND 1980S. </p><p>THEY HAVE LONG COMPLAINED ABOUT LIBERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES\' </p><p>HARBORING KURDISH (PKK), LEFTIST (DHKP-C) AND ISLAMIST </p><p>(HIZBOLLAH, KAPLANISTS) "TERRORISTS."  THEY FEEL OTHER </p><p>NATIONS DO NOT APPRECIATE TURKEY\'S SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF </p><p>THESE PARTIES.  THUS, THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA WERE </p><p>QUICK TO RESPOND TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11.  AT ALL </p><p>LEVELS, THERE WAS AN OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY AND SOLIDARITY. </p><p>BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSTANT REMINDER THAT NOW OTHERS </p><p>WERE BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE WHAT TURKS HAD LIVED WITH FOR </p><p>YEARS.  TURKEY\'S PRE-9/11 HISTORIC COOPERATION WITH THE US IN </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT, MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES HAS </p><p>ONLY INCREASED IN THE LAST YEAR WITH PUBLIC COMMITMENTS OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM FROM THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MILITARY.  THERE HAS BEEN VERY </p><p>VISIBLE SUPPORT FOR THE SECURITY OF AMERICANS AT OUR </p><p>MISSION\'S BUILDINGS BY LOCAL POLICE.  AS THE STORM BROKE ON </p><p>THE NOVEMBER 17 ARRESTS IN GREECE, THERE WAS INTENSE COVERAGE </p><p>WITH A NEW "I TOLD YOU SO" IMPLICATION IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>PRINT MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) THE TURKISH STAND ON TERRORISM HAS BEEN "SOFTER" IN </p><p>THE CASE OF THE CHECHENS.  CHECHENS ARE, OF COURSE, MUSLIMS </p><p>AND THERE ARE CULTURAL TIES BETWEEN TURKS AND CHECHENS AND </p><p>LONG TIME RIVALRY WITH RUSSIA.  THE ARMED, BUT NOT VIOLENT, </p><p>TAKEOVERS OF A FERRYBOAT IN 1996 AND A HOTEL IN 2001 IN </p><p>ISTANBUL WERE TREATED MORE LIKE PROTESTS THAN LIKE TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS BY THE MEDIA.  THAT CHANGED WITH THE OCTOBER 23, 2002 </p><p>CAPTURE OF A THEATER IN MOSCOW WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED DEAD. </p><p>TURKEY DID CONDEMN THE HOSTAGE-TAKING, BUT WITH THE MEDIA </p><p>STILL ADDRESSING THE SUFFERING OF THE CHECHEN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) TURKEY HAS A FREE PRESS.  IN THE LEFTIST AND ISLAMIC </p><p>FRINGE PRESS, CHECHEN REBELS, PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS AND </p><p>EVEN AL QAIDA MEMBERS CAN BE PORTRAYED AS "FREEDOM FIGHTERS." </p><p> TERRORISM HAS LONG BEEN AN INTEREST OF ACADEMICS AND WRITERS </p><p>IN TURKEY.  IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL </p><p>CONFERENCES ON THE TOPIC.  THOSE ORGANIZED BY INSTITUTIONS OF </p><p>THE STATE HAVE BEEN SEEN AS TOOLS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  PRIVATELY-FUNDED ACADEMIC PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME </p><p>MORE FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF TERRORISM AND THE </p><p>ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS BY THE GOT (F) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (U) THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY CONTINUED ITS AGGRESSIVE </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2002.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN A JOINT </p><p>OPERATION, THE TURKISH CUSTOMS GUARD AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (MIT) SEIZED NINE KALASHINIKOV RIFLES AND </p><p>ONE SCORPION ASSASSINATION PISTOL WITH SILENCER FROM A CAR AT </p><p>THE KAPIKULE BORDER GATE IN SEPTEMBER 2002.  THESE WEAPONS </p><p>ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE </p><p>DHKP/C TO BE USED IN SUPPOSED OPERATIONS TO CREATE </p><p>DISTURBANCES PRIOR TO THE TURKISH GENERAL ELECTIONS HELD IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>24. (U) ADDITIONALLY, THE GOT APPREHENDED THREE SUSPECTED AL </p><p>QAIDA OPERATIVES NEAR THE IRANIAN BORDER (NEAR VAN).  THE GOT </p><p>FOLLOWED UP BY ARRESTING DOCUMENT FORGERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>THREE, NEAR BURSA IN NORTHWESTERN TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) THE GOT CONTINUES ITS ACTIVE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>PKK/KADEK, THOUGH ITS SECURITY OPERATIONS TEMPO HAS BEEN </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN LINE WITH A REDUCTION IN THE </p><p>CONFLICT.  IT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO STEM ANY POTENTIAL </p><p>DISTURBANCES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM (G) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>26. (U) THE GOT CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY OPPOSES BOTH </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  TURKEY DOES NOT VIEW </p><p>ITS MAINTENANCE OF DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA AS </p><p>CONSTITUTING SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>SUPPORT STATEMENTS FOR TERRORIST COUNTRIES (H) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U) TURKEY SHARES BORDERS WITH, AND HAS BEEN AN HISTORIC </p><p>TRADING PARTNER OF SYRIA, IRAN AND IRAQ.  IT BALANCES A </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES </p><p>(INCLUDING PROVIDING HAVENS FOR THE PKK) WITH THE NEED TO </p><p>ACCESS HISTORIC TRADE ROUTES.  THUS TURKEY WILL PROVIDE BASES </p><p>FOR OPERATION NORTHERN WATCH WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SENDING </p><p>LARGE TRADE DELEGATIONS TO BAGHDAD AND TEHRAN.  PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS AGAINST STATE-SUPPORTED TERRORISM ARE CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM (I) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>28. (U) SINCE THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE GOT HAS TAKEN </p><p>AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE WORLDWIDE OPPOSITION AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> IN MAY 2002 THE EUROPEAN UNION PLACED THE PKK AND DHKP/C ON </p><p>ITS LIST OF TERRORIST GROUPS AFTER AN INTENSIVE PUSH BY THE </p><p>GOT FOR THE EU TO ADOPT TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST TURKISH </p><p>TERROR GROUPS OPERATING IN EUROPE.  IT CONTINUES TO PRESS THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO RECOGNIZE KADEK AS THE SUCCESSOR </p><p>OF THE PKK AND THUS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>USG COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH GOT (J) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>29. (U) TURKEY REMAINS A STAUNCH ALLY IN THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM.  IN THE FACE OF STRONG PUBLIC OPPOSITION, </p><p>PARLIAMENT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PM ECEVIT, PASSED A </p><p>RESOLUTION ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO SEND TURKISH TROOPS </p><p>ABROAD AND TO PERMIT THE STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS ON </p><p>TURKISH SOIL TO SUPPORT OEF.  AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION, TURKEY OFFERED A 90-MAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT </p><p>FOR DUTY IN AFGHANISTAN.  THE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) </p><p>CONTINUE TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT PROTECTION OF US DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>MILITARY FACILITIES THROUGHOUT TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>30. (U) IN 2002, TURKEY RATIFIED THE UN CONVENTION ON </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST FINANCING.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS </p><p>CONVENTION, TURKEY ADDS TO ITS DOMESTIC ASSET FREEZE LIST ALL </p><p>NAMES ADDED TO THE ASSET FREEZE LIST MAINTAINED BY THE UN </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE UNDER UNSCRS 1267 AND 1373. </p><p> </p><p>31. (U) TURKEY IS ALSO AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  SINCE 1999, </p><p>THE TURKS ACCEPTED ELEVEN ATA COURSES, TO INCLUDE A SENIOR </p><p>LEVEL FINANCIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF TERRORISM SEMINAR AND A </p><p>FOLLOW-ON FINANCIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF TERRORISM SEMINAR FOR </p><p>INVESTIGATORS. </p><p> </p><p>(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) </p><p> </p><p>32. (S) THE TURKISH MILITARY HAS ALSO OFFERED THE USE OF AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL AIRBASE TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON INCIRLIK AFB AND </p><p>EASED FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS TO EASE US SUPPORT OF FORCES </p><p>OPERATING IN AFGHANISTAN.  OTHER TURKISH ACTIONS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF OEF INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-     ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO AUTHORIZE DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>TROOPS ABROAD AND STATIONING OF ADDITIONAL FOREIGN TROOPS IN </p><p>TURKEY IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM; </p><p> </p><p>-     ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO OFFER SPECIAL OPERATIONS </p><p>FORCES (OFFER OF 90) </p><p> </p><p>-     ALLOWED THE US TO USE INCIRLIK AIR BASE AS THE KEY </p><p>TRANSIT POINT FOR HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>(INCLUDING LETHAL MUNITIONS) TO THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND US </p><p>SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN; </p><p> </p><p>-     OFFERED THE USE OF ADDITIONAL AIR BASES IN TURKEY FOR </p><p>OEF-RELATED OPERATIONS; </p><p> </p><p>-     AUTHORIZED THE US TO USE INCIRLIK AIR BASE TO TRANSIT </p><p>TALIBAN AND AL-QAIDA DETAINEES FROM AFGHANISTAN TO GTMO; </p><p> </p><p>-     STREAMLINED CUSTOM PROCEDURES AND GRANTED BLANKET </p><p>OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCES FOR US OEF-RELATED AIRCRAFT (OVER 5,000 </p><p>FLIGHTS TO DATE); </p><p> </p><p>-     PROVIDES KC-135 TANKER SUPPORT AND BASING FOR THE WAR </p><p>ON TERRORISM.  TURKEY ALREADY HAS CONTRIBUTED CLOSE TO 80 </p><p>KC-135 OEF-RELATED MISSIONS FROM TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION-INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION (K/1) </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) </p><p> </p><p>33. (C) THE MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND TURKEY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JANUARY 1981, </p><p>GOVERNS INVESTIGATIVE COOPERATION.  THE GOT HAS PROCESSED </p><p>REQUESTS FOR INVESTIGATIVE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE UNDER THIS </p><p>TREATY.  HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES THE GOT HAS LEFT REQUESTS </p><p>UNANSWERED FOR OVER THREE YEARS.  CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TURKISH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>JUSTICE CONTINUE IN AN EFFORT TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION-PREVENTION (K/2) </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34. (U) THE GOT COORDINATES CLOSELY WITH THE USG ON </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING INITIATIVES.  IN RESPONSE TO USG </p><p>REQUESTS TO FREEZE TERRORIST-RELATED FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE </p><p>GOT HAS ADDED TO ITS DOMESTIC ASSET FREEZE LIST ALL NAMES OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS RELATED TO UNSCRS 1267 AND 1373 (NAMES </p><p>RELATED TO FINANCING OF TALIBAN AND AL-QAIDA.)    THE GOT </p><p>ALSO INVESTIGATES THESE NAMES AND FREEZES ASSETS FOUND IN </p><p>TURKEY.  TO DATE, THESE EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN FREEZING </p><p>ABOUT USD 2 MILLION IN FINANCIAL ASSETS OWNED BY AN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL ON AN USG EXECUTIVE ORDER FREEZE LIST.  THE GOT IS </p><p>REVIEWING THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDING ITS LEGAL PROCESS FOR </p><p>FREEZING FINANCIAL ASSETS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE QUICK </p><p>REACTION TO NEW INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>COOPERATION DURING PAST FIVE YEARS- PREVENTION (L) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>35. (U) OVERALL, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE GOT HAS WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN THE APPREHENSION, CONVICTION, AND </p><p>PUNISHMENT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS IN </p><p>TURKEY.  GOT RESPONSE IS ALWAYS IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>WHEN ALERTED TO THREAT OR INCIDENT INVOLVING US INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
