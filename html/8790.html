<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION G8 SUMMIT; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Africa should adopt one position on </p><p>      G8" the independent weekly "The Business Tribune" dedicated </p><p>      its June 12 editorial to criticizing the G8 for failing to </p><p>      meet their obligations to Africa at the just-ended summit </p><p>      in Evian, France.  Stating: "Africa must remain on the </p><p>      agenda of the G8 until these obligations are fulfilled." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The 2003 G8 was ultimately a disaster for </p><p>      African farmers.  It failed to adopt even limited proposals </p><p>      for a moratorium on reducing European and American tariff </p><p>      duties and subsidies for U. S. and European agriculture. </p><p>      These policies are perverse.  While millions of African </p><p>      farmers, mostly women\'s livelihoods, are ruined by these </p><p>      policies, European livestock is ensured major state </p><p>      subsidies. . .Without a change in world trade rules, </p><p>      the rhetoric of ensuring a fresh start for Africa </p><p>      would not translate into meaningful action or a new </p><p>      partnership for Africa.  African leaders and </p><p>      citizens were urged to take forward the initiative </p><p>      and the primary responsibility for resolving </p><p>      Africa\'s development crises. . .Despite the failure </p><p>      of Evian, the G8 continues to have outstanding </p><p>      obligations and commitments to Africa.  For this </p><p>      reason, Africa must remain on the agenda of the G8 </p><p>      until these obligations are fulfilled." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
