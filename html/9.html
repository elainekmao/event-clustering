<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 1 OF 2 TEHRAN 2069 </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO </p><p>Systematic Review 05 JUL 2006 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 11652: GDS </p><p>TAGS: PINT, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH </p><p>MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE </p><p>REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS </p><p>OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. </p><p>SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN\'S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY </p><p>BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED </p><p>FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT </p><p>CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. </p><p>ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE </p><p>IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION </p><p>WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED </p><p>TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS </p><p>THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO </p><p>BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1. SHAH\'S LENGTHY STATEMENT AT HIS MARCH 2 PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM </p><p>WITH CORRESPONDENTS FOR FOREIGN MEDIA WERE EXCLUDED, (TEXT SENT BY </p><p>AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL </p><p>ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, </p><p>AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER </p><p>GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER </p><p>PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS </p><p>WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER </p><p>UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>2. SHAH\'S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN\'S </p><p>GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY </p><p>WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES </p><p>AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. </p><p>SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE </p><p>COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES </p><p>UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN\' GOALS. IN </p><p>ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE </p><p>SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW </p><p>ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS </p><p>FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) </p><p>MONARCHY, (2) IRAN\'S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) </p><p>REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS </p><p>WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO </p><p>VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. </p><p>BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE </p><p>THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS </p><p>UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. </p><p>IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE </p><p>IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN IRAN\'S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION </p><p>THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH\'S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY </p><p>SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM </p><p>AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. </p><p>AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN </p><p>1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI </p><p>MANSUR\'S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY </p><p>WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM </p><p>MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH </p><p>AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. </p><p>AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES </p><p>GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED </p><p>OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH\'S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS </p><p>HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF </p><p>MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY </p><p>STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO </p><p>APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS </p><p>YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME </p><p>REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED </p><p>FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN </p><p>IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC </p><p>JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE </p><p>FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF </p><p>QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE </p><p>TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT </p><p>JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO </p><p>SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS </p><p>OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY </p><p>GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR </p><p>IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>SHAH\'S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY </p><p>DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. </p><p> </p><p>5. SHAH\'S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND </p><p>MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES </p><p>WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY </p><p>WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE </p><p>PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL </p><p>ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL </p><p>PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH\'S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM </p><p>THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE </p><p>WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING </p><p>OUT SHAH\'S WISHES. </p><p> </p><p>6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO </p><p>INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN\'S IMAGE AS </p><p>COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD </p><p>SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF </p><p>COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR </p><p>LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION </p><p>IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM </p><p>DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN </p><p>CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION </p><p>OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS </p><p>POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, </p><p>SHAH\'S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO </p><p>OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM </p><p>WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HELMS </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO </p><p>Systematic Review 05 JUL 2006 </p><p></p></div>
