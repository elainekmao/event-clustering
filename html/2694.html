<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, AORC, PHUM, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: BHUTANESE REFUGEES: AMBASSADOR VISITS CAMP, TALKS </p><p>NEAR DEADLOCK </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 2131 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador visited three Bhutanese refugee camps in </p><p>eastern Nepal March 25.  Overall, the refugees expressed </p><p>satisfaction with conditions in the camps, but an </p><p>undercurrent of frustration was in evidence.  The Refugee </p><p>Affected Area Program for the region has concluded, and aid </p><p>workers warned that tensions with locals could rise in the </p><p>absence of additional similar programs.  Talks between Nepal </p><p>and Bhutan have stalled, and Post advocates engaging Bhutan </p><p>to urge a timely resolution of the refugee issue.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Camp Visit </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nearly one year to the day after the Nepal-Bhutan </p><p>joint verification process got underway, Ambassador visited </p><p>Bhutanese refugee camps in Morang and Jhapa districts in </p><p>eastern Nepal on March 25.  After inspecting the camps at </p><p>Sanischare in Morang and Beldangi I and II in Jhapa, he met </p><p>with local authorities and with staff from UNHCR, WFP and </p><p>their implementing partners. </p><p> </p><p>Conditions Remain Good, But Frustration Evident </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Overall, conditions - including hygienic, </p><p>nutritional and educational - in the camps remain quite good, </p><p>and refugees expressed satisfaction with the camps\' </p><p>administration.  However, John Andrew, the new head of </p><p>UNHCR\'s Jhapa field office, commented that upon his arrival </p><p>the first thing he noticed was how poorly clothed the </p><p>youngest children were.  New children\'s clothing - including </p><p>material for school uniforms - had not been provided for </p><p>several years.  Some refugees voiced concern about the lack </p><p>of opportunities for post-secondary education, funding for </p><p>which has also been scarce. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) An undercurrent of frustration was evident in talks </p><p>with the refugees, and some aid workers feared that this </p><p>frustration could get out of hand.  Refugee leaders have </p><p>expressed concern about rumors in the camps that the refugees </p><p>will have to reapply for citizenship two years after </p><p>repatriation to Bhutan.  The leaders were also worried that </p><p>reports that Bhutan has encouraged settlers to occupy the </p><p>refugees\' former lands would rile camp residents. </p><p> </p><p>Refugee Affected Area Program Ended </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Relations between refugees and locals remain "quite </p><p>good," according to local officials.  They acknowledged a </p><p>danger that the refugees - who are not supposed to work on </p><p>the local economy and thus have a lot of time on their hands </p><p>- were at risk of becoming involved with the Maoists.  Local </p><p>officials, UN staff and NGO representatives all expressed </p><p>concern that the UNHCR\'s Refugee Affected Area Program (RAAP) </p><p>had concluded.  RAAPs typically run for four years, and the </p><p>RAAP associated with the Bhutanese refugees was extended for </p><p>a second four-year period.  Funding has now run out, and the </p><p>program has been discontinued.  To date, relations between </p><p>the refugees and locals have been good, but this could be </p><p>hard to maintain in the absence of a continued program to </p><p>build good will, one UNHCR staffer judged.  Considering the </p><p>extreme level of poverty in the areas surrounding the refugee </p><p>camps, additional inputs would be needed.  In future, donors </p><p>should avoid giving the impression that such relief could </p><p>last a long time, the UNHCR Representative in Kathmandu </p><p>admitted. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal-Bhutan Talks: Deadlock Looms </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MFA Under Secretary Prahalad Prasai told us March 21 </p><p>that talks with Bhutan are in "kind of a deadlock."  When </p><p>pressed, however, Prasai back-pedaled, insisting that a </p><p>deadlock had not yet been reached.  Bhutan was using </p><p>"procrastination and delay tactics," and had not yet given a </p><p>reply to Nepal\'s requet to set a date for the next round of </p><p>Ministerial talks.  Verification teams have gone back to </p><p>their respective capitals until further notice.  (Note:  In </p><p>Geneva, the Director of UNHCR\'s Asia Bureau recently met with </p><p>Bhutan\'s Ambassador to discuss the status of the talks, the </p><p>UNHCR Representative here told us.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The refugee camps are fertile ground for unrest and </p><p>violence related either to the slowness of the joint </p><p>verification process or to the Maoists insurgency.  In its </p><p>talks with Nepal, Bhutan has not shown a sense of urgency </p><p>proportional to this risk.  As we have urged before (Reftel), </p><p>we continue to believe that we should engage Bhutan on this </p><p>issue sooner rather than later. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
