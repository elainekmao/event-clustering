DID NOT PLAY A BIG ROLE BUT WAS A </p><p>COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND OF FOUAD AL TOM WHO PUT HIS NAME </p><p>IN THE LIST. </p><p> </p><p>---ARRESTED MARCH 1970 WITH THE REST OF THE LEADING </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS.  RELEASED FROM PRISON TOWARDS THE </p><p>END OF 1971 DURING THE AMNESTY GRANTED BY NIMEIRI </p><p>AFTER HE WAS ELECTED AS PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>---1973 - LEADER OF THE UNSUCCESSFUL SHE\'BAN </p><p>UPRISING.  FLED TO LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>---1973-1976 - JOINED THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE </p><p>SUDANESE NATIONAL FRONT AND SPENT HIS TIME TRAVELLING </p><p>BETWEEN LIBYA, BRITAIN, AND SUDAN PREPARING FOR THE </p><p>SO CALLED LIBYAN INVASION. </p><p> </p><p>---IN 1976 CAME TO SUDAN LEADING A DIVISION OF </p><p>FIGHTERS AND WAS IN CHARGE OF EASTERN OMDURMAN AREA </p><p>INCLUDING THE RADIO STATION. </p><p> </p><p>---FLED THE COUNTRY AFTER HIDING FOR SIX MONTHS. </p><p>SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ABSENTIA. </p><p> </p><p>---RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY AFTER THE RECONCILIATION </p><p>IN 1977 AND WORKED IN PRIVATE BUSINESS.  MANAGED TO </p><p>START A TRAVEL AND TOURISM AGENCY IN KHARTOUM. </p><p>DURING THIS PERIOD HE WAS AN ORGANIZER IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE NIF. </p><p> </p><p>---ARRESTED BY NIMEIRI IN MARCH 1985.  RELEASED BY </p><p>THE INTIFADA, APRIL 1985. </p><p> </p><p>---ELECTED FOR THE ASSEMBLY AS NIF (KORDOFAN </p><p>GRADUATES CONSTITUENCY). </p><p> </p><p>---ARRESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF OMAR AL BASHIR ON </p><p>JUNE 30, 1989 WHEN BASHIR OVERTHREW PRIME MINISTER </p><p>SADIQ AL MAHDI.  RELEASED NOVEMBER, 1989. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AL SANUSSI IS A CLOSE ASSOCIATE AND FRIEND OF </p><p>HASSAN AL TURABI AND IS CONSIDERED THE NUMBER THREE </p><p>IN THE NIF BY MOST OBSERVERS.  HIS PERSONAL CLOSENESS </p><p>TO TURABI IS EVIDENT.  HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOM </p><p>TURABI ASKED TO MEET HIM IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS ARRIVAL </p><p>FROM AN OTTAWA HOSPITAL WHERE HE HAD BEEN UNDER CARE </p><p>AFTER BEEN ATTACKED THERE.  SANUSSI ACTS AS TURABI\'S </p><p>"MIDDLEMAN" IN ARRANGING MEETINGS, PASSING MESSAGES </p><p>AND SEEING THAT INSTRUCTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT.  IN </p><p>PUBLIC WHERE TURABI IS, SANUSSI IS USUALLY NEARBY. </p><p>WITH THE ILLNESS OF TURABI, HE IS EVEN CLOSER </p><p>PHYSICALLY THAN EVER BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN CONVERSATIONS SANUSSI IS SOFT SPOKEN AND </p><p>ADHERES CLOSELY TO NIF DOCTRINE.  HIS SUPPORTERS, </p><p>THERE ARE A FEW, SAY IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN ON </p><p>THE FORMULATION OF NIF POLICY.  HIS DETRACTORS, THERE </p><p>ARE MORE, SAY HIS ADHERENCE TO NIF POLICY IS LEARNED </p><p>BY ROTE AND DEMONSTRATES THE SHALLOWNESS OF HIS </p><p>MIND.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE </p><p>DISCUSSING THE KORAN THAN DAY-TO-DAY POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SURPRISINGLY, NONE BELIEVE THAT HE IS THE HEIR TO </p><p>OR A SERIOUS CANDIDATE FOR HASSAN AL TURABI\'S </p><p>POSITION IF TURABI LEAVES THE SCENE.  SANUSSI IS </p><p>CONSIDERED THE TRUSTED AIDE AND THE IMPLEMENTER OF </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS.  THE LONG YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE, </p><p>YEARS IN EXILE AND HIDING, AND TIME SPENT IN PRISON </p><p>CANNOT OUTWEIGH IN THE MIND OF SENIOR NIF MEMBERS THE </p><p>FACT THAT HE IS NOT CONSIDERED AN INTELLECTUAL.  HE </p><p>IS DERISIVELY KNOWN AS THE "SCHOOL TEACHER."  SANUSSI </p><p>IS NOT KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY IN PUBLIC SPEAKING BUT </p><p>HE IS NOTED FOR HIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  WITHIN THE </p><p>NIF HE IS NOT A MAN WHOM OTHERS RESPECT FOR HIS </p><p>INTELLECTUAL ABILITY, IMAGINIATION, OR PUBLIC SPEAKING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  CONVERSATIONS WITH IBRAHIM SANUSSI ARE </p><p>NOT AS INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW AS HIS OPPONENTS </p><p>INDICATE.  THE "FACT" THAT HE IS NOT PURE SUDANESE </p><p>MIGHT BE A FACTOR, THOUGH SADIQ AL MAHDI, THE FORMER </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND HIS POLITICAL OPPONENT, SPEAKS </p><p>APPROVINGLY OF HIS PHYSICAL COURAGE AND HONESTY BUT </p><p>ALSO NOTES HE IS NOT A LEADER FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  IN A REGENCY, IF TURABI </p><p>CANNOT FUNCTION POLITICALLY AS A RESULT OF HIS </p><p>INJURIES, SANUSSI COULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR AN </p><p>INTERREGNUM.  HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH SUCH MEN, I.E. </p><p>JOHN PAUL XXIII.  SANUSSI MAY NOT BE A SUPERIOR </p><p>INTELLECT BUT HE IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM, PHYSICALLY </p><p>COURAGEOUS, WHO HAS PROVEN THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT:  DEFINITELY NO RODNEY </p><p>DANGERFIELD.  IBRAHIM SANUSSI IS CAPABLE OF GAINING </p><p>RESPECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
