<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003128 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, EFIN, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DONORS DISCUSS 2002 BUDGET, PRSP AND </p><p>MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES IN BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  A donors meeting in Brussels November 19-20 </p><p>focused on Nigeria\'s macroeconomic situation, the 2002 budget </p><p>and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process.  Although </p><p>GON economic progress for most of the year has been languid, </p><p>donors agreed that the GON showed fourth quarter improvement </p><p>with lower spending, slower monetary growth and a more </p><p>liberal foreign exchange market.  Given flagging global oil </p><p>prices, donors questioned the assumption of $18 per barrel of </p><p>crude oil as the basis for 2002 budget revenue projections. </p><p>The GON\'s large public wage bill (recurrent expenditures </p><p>represent 65 percent of the total 2002 draft budget </p><p>expenditures) was also received as an issue of concern. </p><p>Donors were disappointed that the draft IPRSP did not contain </p><p>a clear roadmap for how the GON expects to achieve the full </p><p>PRSP.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Core donors met in Brussels November 19-20 to discuss </p><p>Nigeria\'s 2002 Budget, the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy </p><p>Paper (IPRSP) and medium-term development priorities.  The </p><p>first day was devoted to donors only sessions.  The GON </p><p>delegation, led by Principal Secretary to the President </p><p>Stephen Oronsaye, attended the November 20 meeting.  In </p><p>addition to USAID Country Director, USAID Economist and </p><p>Embassy EconOff, representatives from the IMF, World Bank, </p><p>DFID and officials from the European Union, the Netherlands, </p><p>Germany, Belgium, Sweden, France, Denmark and Canada </p><p>attended.  Other GON attendees included Director-General of </p><p>the Debt Management Office, Akin Arikawe and Secretary of the </p><p>Economic Policy Coordinating Committee (EPCC), Festus </p><p>Osunsade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Macroeconomic Performance </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The IMF Representative Arvind Subramanian opened the </p><p>conference with a short presentation on Nigeria\'s </p><p>macroeconomic situation.  He commented that 2001 </p><p>macroeconomic performance was poor.  GON performance was </p><p>checkered by an overly expansionary fiscal policy, inflation </p><p>at roughly 19 percent and a spread of 20 percent between the </p><p>parallel and official exchange rates.  Moreover, GON failure </p><p>to save a significant part of the USD 8 billion in 2000-2001 </p><p>excess oil proceeds for a rainy day had stymied the IMF\'s </p><p>priority objective for Nigeria, the avoidance of boom-bust </p><p>cycles.  Subramanian said the IMF Board would meet the week </p><p>of November 26 to discuss Nigeria\'s fourth quarter </p><p>performance and next steps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Subramanian claimed that fourth quarter performance had </p><p>improved.  The GON, he said, had restricted spending from </p><p>roughly N30 billion per month to N20 billion per month. </p><p>Monetary growth slowed from 50 percent in September to 28 </p><p>percent by December.  The exchange rate market had </p><p>liberalized somewhat now that the CBN was allowing the </p><p>purchase of foreign exchange at more than a 0.5 percent </p><p>difference from the official rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2002 Budget Proposal </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. On the 2002 budget, the IMF believed the proposal was more </p><p>transparent and realistic than the 2001 budget.  The capital </p><p>budget was significantly smaller than 2001 with all projects </p><p>subject to due process review.  However, overall spending </p><p>showed virtually no decline from 2001.  Many donors were </p><p>concerned that the GON assumption of USD 18 per barrel for </p><p>oil exports would not be realized in 2002 and would, </p><p>therefore, result in higher deficit spending since actual </p><p>revenue would not match the estimated earnings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Responding to a donor inquiry, Presidential Principal </p><p>Secretary Oronsaye stated that the President would not </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>revisit the oil price assumption, but would work with the </p><p>National Assembly to trim from the budget an additional N50 </p><p>billion (USD 446 million).  (Comment.  The President will </p><p>face an uphill battle negotiating a further budget reduction </p><p>since many national legislators already deem the budget too </p><p>austere.  End Comment.)  However, Oronsaye pledged, should </p><p>world oil prices plummet, the GON would not succumb to </p><p>deficit spending; the GON would only release allocations </p><p>based on actual revenues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. There was general dissatisfaction with GON progress on the </p><p>IPRSP submitted to the donors November 16.  The World Bank </p><p>representative pointed out the IPRSP should not be an </p><p>abbreviated PRSP, but rather a roadmap describing the process </p><p>the GON will follow to develop the full PRSP.  The roadmap </p><p>should describe the information and analysis needed to </p><p>determine the sources of poverty, identify available GON </p><p>resources and prioritize anti-poverty programs.  However, the </p><p>GON\'s draft IPRSP lacks this strategic roadmap.  Many donors </p><p>felt the draft IPRSP did not reflect inputs from a broad </p><p>range of Nigerian stakeholders nor did it show the requisite </p><p>understanding of poverty and its causes.  Donors expressed </p><p>concern that the PRSP should be a document -- planned, </p><p>authored and fully embraced by Nigerians -- and not an </p><p>artificial paper exercise driven by donor community demands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Attempting to defend the IPRSP, the GON delegation replied </p><p>that the EPCC had received input from state governments and </p><p>by end-December would hold a stakeholders meeting with civil </p><p>society on the PRSP.  Oronsaye promised the process would be </p><p>open-ended and non-exclusive.  He also recognized that the </p><p>PRSP must rely solely on Nigerian resources, although a large </p><p>resource gap would exist, hopefully to be partly filled by </p><p>donor support.  The World Bank representatives said that the </p><p>Bank would provide the GON with examples of successful IPRSPs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Medium Term Objectives/Challenges </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The donors identified the following medium-term </p><p>development priorities for Nigeria: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- civil service reform; the public wage bill is too large, </p><p>preventing allocation of resources to poverty alleviation; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- development of Nigeria\'s non-oil sector; use of oil </p><p>revenues to promote private sector investment in the non-oil </p><p>economy; privatization will be key to recovering efficiency; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- development of agriculture to accelerate poverty reduction; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- cessation of GON involvement in steel production; Ajeokuta </p><p>revitalization should stop; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- capacity-building within the Office of the Chief Economic </p><p>Advisor, particularly the Federal Office of Statistics, in </p><p>order to facilitate the PRSP process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The GON delegation agreed with most of these goals, </p><p>although Oronsaye asserted that the President would not </p><p>tackle civil service reform before the 2003 Presidential </p><p>elections. The delegation raised the issue of debt relief. </p><p>Akin Arikawe felt strongly that the GON\'s debt obligations </p><p>were unsustainable, particularly now that Nigeria is outside </p><p>a formal IMF program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment.  The Brussels meeting provided donors a valuable </p><p>opportunity to discuss the status of Nigeria\'s progress </p><p>vis--vis the IMF and the Poverty Reduction Strategy.  The </p><p>IMF\'s characterization of Nigeria\'s fourth quarter </p><p>macroeconomic performance bodes well for the next IMF team\'s </p><p>visit to Abuja in January.  However, Embassy believes that </p><p>the IMF\'s optimism about further reduction of proposed </p><p>capital expenditures is misplaced.  The GON pledge that the </p><p>President would not bend to deficit spending pressure should </p><p>oil prices fall was reassuring; however, the GON will be </p><p>hard-pressed to honor that pledge if oil prices remain low, </p><p>especially when the election season begins in earnest and </p><p>political considerations take precedence over economic </p><p>imperatives.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
