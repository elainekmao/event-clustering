<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 01023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  CONFLICT BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND THE LEBANESE </p><p>          COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIRUT 1006 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF ON FEBRUARY 26, </p><p>DR. JAMIL NAHMI, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF PUBLIC SECURITY </p><p>(SURETE GENERALE), OFFERED HIS ANALYSIS OF THE RECENT </p><p>CLASHES IN WEST BEIRUT BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND LEBANESE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY(LCP) MILITIAS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NAHMI FIRST NOTED THE DEEP IDEOLOGICIAL DIVIDE WHICH </p><p>SEPARATES RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM AND COMMUNIST </p><p>DOCTRINE.  UNLIKE MANY OTHER OPPOSING MILITIAS IN LEBANON </p><p>WHICH MAINTAIN SOME CONTACTS DESPITE THEIR ANIMOSITIES, </p><p>THE IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDE BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND THE LPC WAS </p><p>SO DEEP THAT IT HAD PRECLUDED ANY WORKING CONTACTS </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, NAHMI SITUATED THE ORIGIN OF </p><p>THE CURRENT HIZBALLAH/LPC CONFLICT IN SOUTH LEBANON.  HE </p><p>ASSERTED THAT OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS AMAL HAD SUCCEEDED </p><p>IN REDUCING SSNP AND LPC PRESENCE IN SOUTH LEBANON AND </p><p>THAT MANY COMMUNIST MILITIAMEN HAD MIGRATED TO WEST </p><p>BEIRUT.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF </p><p>HIZBALLAHI HAD ALSO COME TO WESMV BEIRUT FROM THE SOUTH. </p><p>THUS, NAHMI EXPLAINED, THESE TWO FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSING </p><p>MILITIAS FOUND THEMSELVES CONCENTRATED IN WEST BEIRUT, </p><p>WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AREA.  THIS CONCENTRATION OF </p><p>FORCES IN WEST BEIRUT, THE GENERAL LAWLESSNES AND </p><p>DISORDER THERE, AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE COUNTERVAILING </p><p>SECURITY FORCES HAD PROVIDED FERTILE GROUND FOR A </p><p>HIZBALLAH/LPC CONFLICT.  THE CLASHES HAD APPARENTLY </p><p>ERUPTED AT THE STREET LEVEL AND SIMPLY ESCALATED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ASKED ABOUT REPORTS (REFTEL) THAT SHIITE AND SUNNI </p><p>MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS WERE COOPERATING IN WEST BEIRUT </p><p>AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, NAHMI RESPONDED THAT THERE WAS </p><p>SOME "COINCIDENCE OF OBJECTIVES" BETWEEN PRO-IRANIAN </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS, BE THEY SHIITE OR SZNNI.  THEY </p><p>BOTH TOOK GUIDANCE FROM TEHRAN, WHOSE OWN RELATIONS WITH </p><p>SYRIA HAVE DETERIORIATED, AND THEY BOTH HAD THEIR OWN </p><p>REASONS TO OPPOSE PRO-SYRIAN LEFTIST GROUPS SUCH AS THE </p><p>LCP AND THE SSNP.  SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS SUCH AS THE </p><p>TAWHIID MOVEMENT REMAINED BITTER OVER THEIR DEFEAT IN </p><p>TRIPOLI LAST FALL BY SSNP XD LCP FORCES BACKED BY </p><p>SYRIA.  THE SHIITE FUNDAMENTALISTS SUCH AS HIZBALLAH WERE </p><p>NOW DETERMINED TO OPPOSE MORE DIRECTLY PRO-SYRIAN LEFTIST </p><p>GROUPS, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE RELIGIOUS-VERSUS-SECULAR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT AND BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERIORATING </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SYRIA ITSELF.  NAHMI PREDICTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE TRADITIONAL RIFT BETWEEN SHIITE AND SUNNI </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS WOULD QUICKLY REAPPEAR WHEN THEY NO </p><p>LONGER FACED A COMMON ENEMY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN A BRIEF ASIDE, NAHMI MENTIONED THAT HE HAD MET </p><p>SEPARATELY WITH PSP LEADER JUMBLATT AND AMAL LEADER BARRI </p><p>OVER THE PAST TEN DAYS.  HE SAID JUMBLATT SEEMED TO KNOW </p><p>WERE HE STANDS WITHIN HIS COMMUNITY AND SPOKE WITH SOME </p><p>CONFIDANCE AND AUTHORITY.  BARRI, HOWEVER, SEEMED </p><p>"EXTREMELY ILL AT EASE" ABOUT HIS POSITION AND ACTED AS </p><p>IF HE WERE "WALKING ON SHIFTING SANDS."  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>THE CONVERSATION WAS PREEMPTED AT THIS POINT, AND WE </p><p>CALD NOT DRAW NAHMI M FURTHER ON HIS ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>BARRI\'S POSITION WITHIN THE SHIITE COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BIOGRAPHIC NOTE.  JAMIL NAHMI HAS A DOCTORATE IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE LEBANESE </p><p>UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL.  A STAUNCH GEMAYEL LOYALIST, NAHMI </p><p>WAS ALSO AFFILIATED WITH THE "HOUSE OF THE FUTURE," THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S THINK TANK AND PUBLISHING HOUSE.  ALTHOUGH A </p><p>PHALANGIST, NAHMI COMES FROM KFAR AKKA NEAR AMIUN IN </p><p>NORTH LEBANON, I.E., FROM THE FRANJIYYAH HEARTLAND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
