<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000502 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INADEQUACIES OF THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: After three months delay, INEC published </p><p>some voter lists week of March 3.  With national elections </p><p>just six weeks away, INEC has missed a key legal deadline. </p><p>Challenges are almost certain.  INEC,s performance remains </p><p>erratic, and non-transparent.  INEC will have to work </p><p>efficiently but swiftly to fill the gaps necessary for </p><p>minimally adequate logistical preparations.  Given INEC,s </p><p>history, this feat is unlikely.  Even if the Commission </p><p>should succeed, its credibility is so badly damaged that many </p><p>Nigerians would not believe it.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IN A MIRE OF ITS OWN MAKING </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nigeria\'s Independent National Election Commission </p><p>(INEC) remains unprepared to conduct elections in April. </p><p>While the clock ticks and anxiety mounts, INEC dithers, </p><p>equivocates and prevaricates.  Past and present logistical </p><p>problems have combined with abominable communications and a </p><p>perception of favoritism toward the ruling PDP to engender a </p><p>massive credibility crisis for INEC and its chairman, Dr. </p><p>Abel Guobadia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The biggest grouse has been INEC,s handling of </p><p>voters, registration.  Although INEC conducted the </p><p>registration in September, it has been unable to provide a </p><p>credible estimate of registered voters, let alone a final </p><p>list.  Early on, Guobadia claimed 69 million people </p><p>registered after the first round in September; this number </p><p>was widely disputed.  On one hand, many Nigerians decried </p><p>under-registration by as much as 50 percent while other </p><p>Nigerians claimed that improper multiple registration had </p><p>been rampant.  Meanwhile, computer glitches in both Lagos and </p><p>Kano states, Nigeria,s two most populous states, might have </p><p>affected the inclusion of several million people on the final </p><p>voters list.  Under intense pressure, Guobadia is now </p><p>claiming 67 million total registrants, though days after the </p><p>most recently scheduled date for displaying the lists, names </p><p>have been posted in only a tiny fraction of the registration </p><p>centers.  In any event, the Electoral Act of 2002 (facing a </p><p>legal challenge from the Presidency) stipulates that lists </p><p>must be displayed not less than 60 days prior to the </p><p>election.  With voting scheduled for April 12 and April 19, </p><p>INEC has already missed a key deadline -- even if lists </p><p>magically appear in all registration centers tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) INEC now plans to display the lists in Local </p><p>Government Area headquarters.  Voters in large LGAs </p><p>(primarily rural areas) will have to travel considerable </p><p>distances to ensure that they are registered and protest any </p><p>errors.  The original five-day process has been expanded to </p><p>nine days, evidently to account for the delay in beginning </p><p>the display.  There are reports sourced to INEC officials of </p><p>review processes having gone very well in some areas that, </p><p>according to Embassy contacts, never saw a list posted.  One </p><p>opposition politician reported that the list displayed in his </p><p>LGA in Borno contained names from the Jos area of Plateau </p><p>State rather than those of inhabitants of his LGA.  The </p><p>review process does not allow for adding names to the list, </p><p>which could be a problem for many candidates, as it has been </p><p>reported that some may not be registered voters themselves (a </p><p>prerequisite for running for office).  In a March 10 meeting </p><p>between officials of political parties and Mission officers, </p><p>one candidate said he had no idea whether he was registered </p><p>and wondered how many others in the room could say for </p><p>certain that they were. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While INEC may have mishandled registration and other </p><p>aspects of preparations for the April elections, it has been </p><p>a stickler when measuring the compliance of candidates with </p><p>its regulations.  INEC told the media recently that the vast </p><p>majority of candidates at all levels could not be approved to </p><p>contest the elections because of mistakes and omissions in </p><p>their applications for candidacy.  INEC said it would extend </p><p>the deadline for candidate submissions to March 11.  COMMENT: </p><p>INEC\'s six screening committees will have less than a week to </p><p>review candidates\' submissions.  If the screeners apply </p><p>INEC\'s rules very strictly, complaints will be legion, </p><p>especially if most of the disqualified are from opposition </p><p>parties (likely, since there are 29 opposition parties set </p><p>against the ruling PDP).  If the screeners are too lenient, </p><p>post-election challenges could result in ballot-box winners </p><p>being divested of the fruits of victory.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In addition to troubles with the registration, INEC </p><p>is also confronted with difficulties in arranging election </p><p>logistics.  No sample ballot has been provided for </p><p>examination or for training poll workers and observers, </p><p>though we have been given a general description.  The </p><p>presidential ballot will have 19 political party logos </p><p>running down the center of the page, each with the acronym of </p><p>the party, but no party or candidate names.  Voters are to </p><p>place a thumbprint next to the party symbol of the preferred </p><p>candidate.  This is a bit tricky as the thumbprint space for </p><p>each party will alternate sides between the left and right </p><p>margins from the top to the bottom of the page (a "butterfly </p><p>ballot" of sorts).  For all other elections, the ballots will </p><p>look the same, except with 30 party logos and acronyms, </p><p>whether or not the party has a candidate in the particular </p><p>local, state of National Assembly election.  COMMENT: </p><p>Opposition parties (other than the ANPP) complain that this </p><p>approach makes it difficult for voters to grasp the import of </p><p>their votes.  Voters need not know the name of their </p><p>preferred candidate for an office, but they must know his/her </p><p>party affiliation.  Illiterates will have to be able to link </p><p>a preferred candidate to a symbol (umbrella for the PDP, ear </p><p>of maize for the ANPP, etc.).  Those who can read will have </p><p>to take great care, since most parties have three-letter </p><p>acronyms, a number of which (PDP, PRP, PSP) are not readily </p><p>distinguished one from the other, especially when a butterfly </p><p>ballot is being used.  The fact that numerous candidates have </p><p>switched parties in recent months will add to the confusion. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) INEC,s reassignment of key staff will present other </p><p>problems.  First, the Director of Operations (described by </p><p>IFES as the Commission\'s &most effective staff member8) has </p><p>been reassigned to a non-operational position.  Two hundred </p><p>fifty INEC staff were suspended for allegedly selling </p><p>registration cards or accepting bribes.  INEC has not </p><p>indicated when these officers will be replaced.  Many </p><p>regional elections officers were transferred to another state </p><p>recently, and numerous other reassignments throughout the </p><p>Commission took place during the last month.  Guobadia stated </p><p>that there would be about 500,000 INEC poll workers at </p><p>120,000 polling stations, but no logistical plan for moving </p><p>personnel or materials throughout the country has been </p><p>formulated, to say nothing of funded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) According to the Chairman, INEC will supply each </p><p>polling station with exactly 500 ballots, for a total of 60 </p><p>million (seven million fewer than his own estimate of the </p><p>number of voters).  This also raises the obvious question of </p><p>where to place each booth.  If they use the same locations as </p><p>during registration, there will be numerous complaints.  A </p><p>major complaint in the registration exercise was that booths </p><p>in some (mostly rural) areas had excess material, while in </p><p>other areas the booths were grossly under-equipped.  INEC </p><p>seems to be on course to replicate this error on the election </p><p>days.  INEC could create new polling stations, but that would </p><p>entail even more unfunded costs.  The brother of INEC </p><p>Secretary Hakeem Baba-Ahmed reported that many Commissioners </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>are in a quandary:  They do not want to give more materials </p><p>to one station than another, yet they lack the resources to </p><p>fulfill existing requirements, to say nothing of providing </p><p>one polling station for each 500 voters (reportedly a </p><p>requirement laid down by "politicians").  But if a </p><p>registration site had 1000 bone fide registrants how will the </p><p>extra 500, whose names will appear on lists at other sites, </p><p>know where to go and which site will be theirs? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT ) WAITING TO BE BORN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) A code of conduct for the political parties is still </p><p>in the works.  A draft has been in existence for several </p><p>months.  On February 28, Guobadia made reference to a code of </p><p>conduct prepared by the Commission that had been delivered to </p><p>the parties.  He stated the code would be binding on the </p><p>parties and urged each of them to sign it.  As of now, none </p><p>of the 30 parties has signed the code.  COMMENT:  Party </p><p>leaders argue that their respective constitutions contain </p><p>codes of conduct and that they should abide by these.  Most </p><p>opposition parties do not trust INEC to administer a code of </p><p>conduct fairly, fearing that the Commission will favor the </p><p>ruling PDP.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) INEC has added to its woes by inserting itself into </p><p>intra-party squabbles.  In Jigawa, INEC was involved in an </p><p>ANPP showdown as two different factions submitted their </p><p>respective candidates for governor.  Lack of credibility on </p><p>INEC\'s part meant INEC\'s decision was not final, and the case </p><p>went to court, with a decision finally emerging on March 3. </p><p>Internecine conflict over the ANPP nomination for the Kano </p><p>gubernatorial race continues.  In Adamawa, INEC has managed </p><p>to announce two "official" ANPP gubernatorial candidates, </p><p>although neither is the original candidate submitted by the </p><p>ANPP.  Meanwhile, INEC Secretary Hakeem Baba-Ahmed reportedly </p><p>told ANPP figures that that some INEC Commissioners have </p><p>complained that Guobadia meets with President Obasanjo &too </p><p>regularly.8  True or not, the allegation further weakens the </p><p>organization,s claim of impartiality and independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT:  With elections approximately one month </p><p>away, INEC\'s poor performance to date suggests two critical </p><p>problems.  First, the Commission likely will no longer be </p><p>capable of putting in place the logistics required to carry </p><p>out its election day mandate.  Thus far, INEC\'s response to </p><p>its own shortcomings has been a mixture of equivocation, </p><p>evasion and prevarication.  While one can fudge the display </p><p>of voter lists (at least until the failure to display them as </p><p>required by law leads to a court injunction), the failure to </p><p>establish and resource the 120,000-plus polling places </p><p>required on April 12 and April 19 will be much harder to </p><p>finesse.  Second, the Commission\'s poor performance to date, </p><p>especially its failure to communicate effectively with the </p><p>parties, suggests that vast swathes of Nigeria\'s elite will </p><p>not believe anything Commissioners and INEC staff say in the </p><p>future -- even in the unlikely eventuality that INEC proves </p><p>able to meet the huge logistical challenges it faces. </p><p>Opposition politicians score INEC low on across the board and </p><p>routinely portray the Commission as a tool of the ruling </p><p>party.  Even some PDP adherents privately criticize INEC, </p><p>arguing that its lack of credibility will call into question </p><p>an election that President Obasanjo can handily win </p><p>legitimately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) In short, it may not matter much what INEC does </p><p>between now and the elections, the Commission\'s "negatives" </p><p>are too high for it to regain broad public confidence.  Talk </p><p>of postponing the elections and/or establishing some sort of </p><p>interim government to administer them grows daily.  Several </p><p>of the larger opposition parties have now sought a delay, and </p><p>the NDP reportedly has filed suit, contending that INEC\'s </p><p>failure to "display the authentic voter registration list" 60 </p><p>days before the election means the elections cannot legally </p><p>take place.  Pressing from the other direction is the </p><p>constitutional requirement that voting for President must be </p><p>complete 30 days before the current Administration\'s term of </p><p>office ends on May 28, 2003.  Were the Commission itself a </p><p>candidate for office, it would be time to pull out of the </p><p>race in favor of someone with a chance of winning. </p><p>Unfortunately for Nigeria, there is no constitutional </p><p>alternative to INEC. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
