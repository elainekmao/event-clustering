<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: ON THE EVE OF THE IRAQ VOTE: WHICH WAY WILL TURKEY </p><p>GO? </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM RSDeutsch.  Reasons: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) P.M. Gul\'s cabinet formally submitted a combined draft </p><p>resolution -- covering deployment of U.S. troops through </p><p>Turkey and deployment of Turkish forces abroad -- to </p><p>Parliament Feb. 24. Given procedural requirements, the </p><p>earliest Parliament can begin debate will be 1500 local (0800 </p><p>Washington time) on Tuesday, Feb. 25.  Deputy P.M. Sener </p><p>announced publicly that the Government decided to send the </p><p>petition to Parliament even though "an important" number of </p><p>ministers "did not find it convincing," though in the end </p><p>they joined their colleagues and signed on.  Gul is </p><p>discussing the matter with President Sezer, whose insistence </p><p>on international legitimacy via new UNSC authority remains </p><p>strong and public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In Feb. 24 conversations with us, AK leader Erdogan </p><p>and other senior contacts from across the political spectrum </p><p>-- members of parliament, journalists, think tanks, NGO and </p><p>labor groups -- in the main expressed the belief that the </p><p>ruling AK Party/Government will prevail on its skeptical </p><p>parliamentary group to support passage of the resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Erdogan told the Ambassador they would "do all we can" to </p><p>secure parliamentary support, but cautioned that there will </p><p>have to be some unspecified compromises on the USG-GOT </p><p>political, economic, and military agreements currently being </p><p>negotiated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Sukru Elekdag, retired ambassador and current member of </p><p>opposition CHP, confirmed that his party will vote as a bloc </p><p>against the AK resolution: "We see no urgency for war, and we </p><p>think the inspection regime should be strengthened and given </p><p>more time."  Other CHP M.P.s -- including Foreign Affairs </p><p>Committee member Emin Koc, former minister Abdulkadir Ates, </p><p>pollster Bulent Tanla, and Kurdish tribal leader Esat Canan </p><p>-- echoed one another in declaring that CHP "will 100% </p><p>reject" the resolution, although Koc and Canan opined that </p><p>Erdogan has the votes to make it pass. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former NSC staffer and current executive director of the </p><p>Advanced Strategy Center Faruk Demir avowed that the AK </p><p>Government petition will pass if Erdogan, as he expects, </p><p>backs it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Wire service Anadolu Ajansi Parliament bureau chief Faruk </p><p>Albayrak explained to us Feb. 24 that because the voting will </p><p>take place in a closed session, the chance for passage is </p><p>"much better than 50%." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Parliamentary legal expert Levent Kocak averred that </p><p>"there will be some minor objections but the draft will pass." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Labor union leaders Feridun Tankut (Steelworkers Union </p><p>chairman) and Bulent Pirler (Employers Union secretary </p><p>general) claimed that the resolution will pass.  However, </p><p>Salim Uslu (president of the Islamist-oriented HAK-Is Union) </p><p>said the result will depend on how much the AK government </p><p>works on its parliamentary group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Speaker of parliament (and potential AK party rival to </p><p>both Gul and Erdogan) Bulent Arinc publicly declared that "it </p><p>would not be right" for the government to submit a draft </p><p>without establishing that a possible operation has </p><p>"international legitimacy" in line with the requirements of </p><p>article 92 of the Turkish constitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We expect AK will use its parliamentary majority to </p><p>pass the resolution.  However, in waiting until virtually the </p><p>last minute, and in failing to convince speaker Arinc, AK </p><p>leaders may not have prepared the ground in parliament </p><p>sufficiently, and there is a chance that the draft could </p><p>fail.  Moreover, as Erdogan himself suggested, the draft </p><p>USG-GOT papers and MOUs loom large in the minds of the AK </p><p>leadership and in the legislature; all hinges on whether they </p><p>will be completed before the vote. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
