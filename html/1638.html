<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000905 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/S-O, EAP, EAP/BCLTV, DRL, INR </p><p>NSC FOR EAST ASIAN DIRECTORATE </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EAP STERN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/13/2016 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: CENTRAL COMMITTEE PRESSURES GENERAL SECRETARY TO STEP DOWN; ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH APPARENT SUCCESSOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: HANOI 638 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER DAVID YOUNG; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: ONLY DAYS BEFORE THE NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS BEGINS APRIL 19, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS DEALT </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU A SEVERE BLOW BY REFUSING TO </p><p>RECOMMEND HIM FOR ANOTHER TERM.  A PREFERENCE BALLOT AMONG </p><p>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE GAVE TOP MARKS TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH, AND SEVERAL SOURCES REPORT HE WAS </p><p>CONFIRMED AT A PRE-CONGRESS MEETING APRIL 16 TO BE THE NEXT </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY.  HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF TRIET, WHO </p><p>ALSO RECEIVED SOME SUPPORT FOR THE TOP POST, REPORTEDLY </p><p>WILL SUCCEED KHAI AS PRIME MINISTER, BEING "ELECTED" BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN MAY.  PRESIDENT LUONG REPORTEDLY WILL </p><p>REMAIN IN PLACE.  ONE CONFLICTING PRESS REPORT HAS CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL CHIEF AN PEGGED AS GENERAL SECRETARY; WE </p><p>PREDICT HE WILL REMAIN IN THE POLITBURO AND COULD LAND </p><p>ANOTHER SENIOR POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): NONE OF THIS IS FINAL UNTIL </p><p>CONFIRMED BY THE PARTY CONGRESS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE THE DECISIONS BY THIS WEEKEND.  MANH, WHO IS A </p><p>MODERATE IN THE LEADERSHIP AND HAS HELPED PROFESSIONALIZE </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND GRADUALLY EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE, </p><p>AND THE DYNAMIC SOUTHERN REFORMER TRIET IN TIME MAY ADD A </p><p>NEW DYNAMISM TO THE FACTIONALIZED LEADERSHIP.  OTHER </p><p>REFORMERS APPARENTLY BOUND FOR THE POLITBURO INCLUDE TRADE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00905  01 OF 02  171111Z </p><p>MINISTER VU KHOAN AND DEPUTY PM KHIEM.  IN THE SHORT TERM, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE LEADERSHIP LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN A </p><p>FUNDAMENTALLY CAUTIOUS GROUP.  OVER TIME, THOUGH, GREATER </p><p>PROMINENCE FOR MORE DYNAMIC REFORMERS WILL HELP BOOST THE </p><p>PACE OF AND THE LEADERSHIP\'S COMMITMENT TO THE ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE TELLS PHIEU HE NEEDS TO GO </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SEVERAL SOURCES REPORT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE WEIGHED </p><p>IN STRONGLY AGAINST GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU AT THE </p><p>RECENTLY COMPLETED 12TH PLENUM.  DURING THE PLENUM, PHIEU </p><p>SOUGHT TO RETAIN HIS SUPREME POSITION, BUT RECEIVED ONLY </p><p>40-45 PERCENT OF THE VOTES OF THE ROUGHLY 165 CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS.  ON A SUBSEQUENT BALLOT, WHICH WAS A </p><p>"PREFERENCE" VOTE FOR THE TOP JOB, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH REPORTEDLY RECEIVED ABOUT 40 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE VOTES, HO CHI MINH CITY CPV CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET </p><p>RECEIVED 30 PERCENT, AND THE REMAINDER WAS SPLIT BETWEEN </p><p>HANOI PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN PHU TRONG AND PRESIDENT TRAN DUC </p><p>LUONG, ACCORDING TO A VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN WHO </p><p>SPOKE WITH TWO CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS.  THOUGH THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION, WHICH ENDED APRIL 10, APPARENTLY </p><p>DID NOT FORMALLY CHOOSE PHIEU\'S SUCCESSOR, CLEARLY THE </p><p>GROUP SEEMED TO HAVE STRONGLY SIGNALED TO PHIEU HIS TIME </p><p>WAS UP.  OFFICIAL VIETNAMESE MEDIA HAVE REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE FINALIZED A PROPOSED LIST OF CANDIDATES </p><p>FOR A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE, THOUGH THEY DID NOT COMMENT ON </p><p>THE GENERAL SECRETARY POST, NOR NAME ANY OF THESE PERSONS. </p><p>SEPARATELY, A SOURCE TOLD US PHIEU WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00905  01 OF 02  171111Z </p><p>NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE LIST, WHICH IF TRUE WOULD SEAL HIS </p><p>FATE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DURING THE PAST WEEK, HANOI HAS BEEN RIFE WITH </p><p>RUMORS ABOUT WHETHER MANH WOULD INDEED TAKE THE POST.  ONE </p><p>OF HIS KEY LIEUTENANTS ON THE ASSEMBLY STAFF SAID MANH </p><p>MIGHT NOT WANT TO CHALLENGE FOR THE SPOT AT THIS TIME, </p><p>SINCE HE IS BY NATURE NOT COMBATIVE.  OTHERS ECHOED THIS: </p><p>ONE SOURCE SAID MANH HAD TURNED DOWN THE OFFER, AND ANOTHER </p><p>SPECULATED MANH WOULD BIDE HIS TIME, WHICH COULD OPEN THE </p><p>WAY FOR ONE OF THE OTHER MENTIONED CANDIDATES, SUCH AS CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL CHIEF NGUYEN VAN AN (WHO WAS A FINALIST TO </p><p>PHIEU FOR THE POST IN DECEMBER 1997) OR TRONG. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) HOWEVER, ON APRIL 17 WE RECEIVED SEVERAL REPORTS </p><p>FROM THE APPARENTLY JUST-COMPLETED "PRE-CONGRESS" MEETING </p><p>OF THE CPV LEADERSHIP.  (BA DINH SQUARE WAS FREE OF </p><p>OFFICIAL CARS AND OPEN TO BOTH VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN </p><p>TRAFFIC THIS MORNING, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PLENUM </p><p>BEGAN AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE PRE-CONGRESS.  WE THUS </p><p>DEDUCE THE PRE-CONGRESS CONCLUDED YESTERDAY.)  ONE </p><p>DISCERNING SOURCE ON LEADERSHIP ISSUES REPORTS THAT THE NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP LINE-UP HAS BEEN SET AND BLESSED AT THE PRE- </p><p>CONGRESS.  ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, MANH WILL BECOME CPV </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY "EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY"; APPARENTLY PHIEU </p><p>"HAS ALREADY MOVED OUT OF HIS OFFICE."  LUONG WILL REMAIN </p><p>AS PRESIDENT, AND KHAI WILL STAY IN PLACE AS PRIME MINISTER </p><p>UNTIL MAY 2001 (WHICH WOULD BE WHEN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>WOULD NEXT MEET TO APPROVE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>POSITIONS).  AT THAT TIME, TRIET WOULD BECOME THE NEW PM </p><p>(WITH HIM BECOMING THE NEW FIRST DEPUTY PM IN THE INTERIM). </p><p>THIS SOURCE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CURRENT FIRST </p><p>DEPUTY PM NGUYEN TAN DUNG, WHO LONG HAS BEEN SEEN AS LIKELY </p><p>TO MOVE UP TO THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP.  THIS SOURCE ALSO </p><p>SAYS FM NIEN WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE, AND VU KHOAN WOULD </p><p>ASSUME DEPUTY PM CAM\'S PORTFOLIO WITH OVERSIGHT OVER BOTH </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: POTENTIALLY A MORE REFORM-MINDED LEADERSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: THESE REPORTED CHANGES SEEM PLAUSIBLE AND </p><p>WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH "THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE" WE </p><p>HAVE BEEN MONITORING OVER THE PAST MONTHS.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THERE CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE WIDELY VARYING REPORTS. </p><p>THOUGH OUR INFORMATION IS ADMITTEDLY INCOMPLETE, THIS </p><p>APPEARS TO BE A SOMEWHAT UNIQUE POLITICAL MOMENT IN </p><p>VIETNAM, IN THAT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>RULED CONTRARY TO THE POLITBURO, WITH THE FINAL DECISION </p><p>HAVING BEEN FORWARDED TO THE PRE-CONGRESS MEETING ONLY DAYS </p><p>BEFORE THE CONGRESS ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00905  02 OF 02  171111Z </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT (CONT\'D): IF CONFIRMED, SUCH A NEW LINEUP </p><p>WOULD BE COLLECTIVELY MORE REFORM-MINDED THAN THE CURRENT </p><p>VERSION.  MANH, A MODERATE IN THE LEADERSHIP WHO HAS </p><p>PRESSED FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO BECOME MORE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL AND TO ASSUME A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>LAWMAKING, WOULD BE A CLEAR IMPROVEMENT OVER THE HIGHLY </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY PHIEU.  MANH, WHILE TO ALL APPEARANCES A VERY </p><p>COMMITTED COMMUNIST, SEEMS TO BE A QUIET COALITION BUILDER, </p><p>AND HE HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH MUCH MORE PRACTICAL </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE AS ASSEMBLY CHAIR THAN </p><p>HAS PHIEU.  THAT SAID, MANH\'S COMMENTS TO VISITING SENATOR </p><p>KERRY DURING THE RECENT POTUS TRIP ARE A REMINDER WE SHOULD </p><p>NOT EXPECT MOVEMENT ON POLITICAL REFORM: MANH WAS ADAMANT </p><p>IN DEFENDING VIETNAM\'S POLITICAL SYSTEM AS FULLY </p><p>"DEMOCRATIC," SAYING VIETNAM DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE MULTIPLE </p><p>PARTIES IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT (CONT\'D): PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT OVER TIME, </p><p>THOUGH, WOULD BE THAT SUCH A NEW LINE-UP, IF CONFIRMED, </p><p>WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN THE BROADER PROCESS OF </p><p>GENERATIONAL CHANGE TO A YOUNGER, MORE TECHNOCRATIC, "POST- </p><p>WAR" LEADERSHIP.  MANH, 60, IS NEARLY A FULL DECADE YOUNGER </p><p>THAN PHIEU.  TRIET, 58, GETS HIGH MARKS IN HCMC FOR HIS </p><p>WORK AT THE FOREFRONT OF ECONOMIC REFORM.  COUPLED WITH </p><p>MORE DYNAMIC REFORMERS LIKE VU KHOAN, ONE OF THE KEY </p><p>ARCHITECTS OF OUR BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, AND DEPUTY PM </p><p>KHIEM, THIS "COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP" COULD BECOME RE- </p><p>ENERGIZED AND MORE WILLING TO EMBRACE A MORE POSITIVE </p><p>VISION OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF GLOBALIZATION -- RATHER THAN </p><p>ONLY HARPING ON ITS PERILS.  THAT SAID, WE MUST CAUTION </p><p>THAT IDEOLOGUES SUCH AS TRONG, HARD-LINE CPV CADRE, AND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00905  02 OF 02  171111Z </p><p>POWERFUL MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO SERVE AS CHECKS ON ANY "JEFFERSONIAN" VISIONS </p><p>THAT MIGHT DANCE THROUGH ANY CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
