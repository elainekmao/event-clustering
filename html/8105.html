<p>UNCLAS ROME 002182 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR BURCKY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY - 2003 SPECIAL 301 NOTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>    REF:  STATE 111508 </p><p> </p><p>(U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE </p><p>PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) ON MAY 6, ECONCOUNS CALLED ON MAURO MASI, DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL FOR THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSIONER OF SIAE (THE COPYRIGHT ROYALTY </p><p>COLLECTING SOCIETY), REGARDING THE SPECIAL 301 </p><p>NOTIFICATION FOR ITALY (REFTEL).  MASI WAS NOT SURPRISED </p><p>BY THE DECISION TO KEEP ITALY ON THE WATCH LIST.  HE WAS </p><p>WELL AWARE OF THE REASONS BEHIND THIS DECISION.  HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE GOI IS FULLY COMMITTED TO PURSUING IPR </p><p>PROTECTION.  MOREOVER, MASI POINTED TO THE SERIOUS </p><p>ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE GUARDIA DI </p><p>FINANZA (FINANCE POLICE).  MASI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH PIRACY RESULTS FROM </p><p>INCONSISTENCY IN COURT RULINGS AND THE RELUCTANCE OF </p><p>JUDGES TO TREAT IPR VIOLATIONS AS SERIOUS OFFENCES. MASI </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THE ITALIAN PUBLIC WAS COMING TO APPRECIATE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF IPR AND WAS LESS PRONE TO PURCHASING </p><p>PIRATED MATERIALS.  WHILE HE KNEW THAT SUCH CHANGES IN </p><p>MENTALITY WOULD TAKE TIME, HE FELT THAT THE IMPROVEMENT </p><p>WAS QUITE REAL </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE DISCUSSION THEN TURNED TO WHETHER </p><p>COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE (AND PAY </p><p>FOR) A SIAE STICKER. ECONCOUNS EXPLAINED THAT THIS METHOD </p><p>PUT THE BURDEN OF EFFORT AND COST ON THE INDUSTRY - </p><p>ALREADY THE VICTIMS OF PIRACY.  MASI STATED HIS </p><p>LONGSTANDING POSITION THAT THE SIAE STICKER IS THE BEST </p><p>    WAY TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC ARE </p><p>LEGITIMATE.  WHILE MASI ADDED THAT, WHILE HE WAS NOT </p><p>FULLY CONVINCED BY THE BUSINESS SOFTWARE ALLIANCE\'S (BSA) </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT BUSINESS SOFTWARE SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE </p><p>STICKER REQUIREMENT, THE GOI HAD DONE ALL WITHIN ITS </p><p>POWER OF AMENDING REGULATIONS TO SATISFY BSA\'S REQUESTS. </p><p>ANY FURTHER ACTION WOULD HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED BY AMENDING </p><p>EXISTING LEGISLATION "WHICH OF COURSE IS A MUCH MORE </p><p>COMPLEX PROCEDURE." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) MASI TOLD ECONCOUNS THAT HE PLANNED TO PRESENT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DRAFT IPR LEGISLATION TO PARLIAMENT DURING </p><p>2003.  HE WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE THESE DRAFTS WITH THE </p><p>USG AS THEY ARE DEVELOPED, AND TO CONSIDER USG COMMENTS. </p><p>AT THIS POINT, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE ANY </p><p>INDICATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MASI HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE CARETAKER </p><p>COMMISSIONER OF SIAE. HE WAS APPOINTED TO BRING SIAE OUT </p><p>OF A DEEP FINANCIAL CRISIS BY INCREASING REVENUES AND </p><p>CUTTING EXPENDITURES.  THIS HE HAS DONE.  ASKED ABOUT HIS </p><p>FUTURE ROLE, MASI INDICATED THAT SIAE WOULD ELECT A BOARD </p><p>AND CHAIRMAN BY SEPTEMBER 2003.  WHILE HE WILL PROBABLY </p><p>NOT BE THE NEW CHAIRMAN, MASI SAID HE WOULD MOST LIKELY </p><p>CONTINUE TO SIT ON THE SIAE BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: IN HIS DUAL ROLE -- COMMISSIONER OF </p><p>SIAE AND SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE </p><p>FOR COPYRIGHT POLICY -- MASI HAS SHOWN FAR MORE INTEREST </p><p>IN IMPROVING SIAE\'S FINANCIAL SITUATION THAN IN FIGHTING </p><p>PIRACY.  WE WOULD HOPE THAT HIS CHANGED ROLE AT SIAE WILL </p><p>    MEAN A CHANGE IN HIS PRIORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) REGARDING IPR ENFORCEMENT MORE GENERALLY IN </p><p>ITALY, THE GUARDIA DI FINANZA (FINANCE POLICE) HAS WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE IPR INDUSTRY AND THE MISSION FOR THE </p><p>LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO FIGHT COPYRIGHT PIRACY.  THE </p><p>CARABINIERI (NATIONAL MILITARY POLICE) HAVE MADE </p><p>INCREASING EFFORTS AS WELL.  THERE ARE NOW FREQUENT </p><p>ARRESTS FOR COPYRIGHT PIRACY.  HOWEVER, ITALIAN JUDGES </p><p>ARE ALMOST ALL UNWILLING TO SENTENCE INDIVIDUALS TO </p><p>PRISON FOR COPYRIGHT PIRACY.  SO LONG AS CRIMINALS KNOW </p><p>THAT THEY FACE NO REAL POSSIBILITY OF JAIL TIME, PIRACY </p><p>RATES WILL NOT FALL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02182 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
