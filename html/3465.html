<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001812 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION FOOD AID; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Flush out rogue NGOs" the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "The Chronicle" dedicated its August 7 </p><p>      editorial to calling on the government to excommunicate all </p><p>      non-governmental organizations (NGOs) accused of "abusing </p><p>      the privilege" to hand out drought relief supplies to rural </p><p>      communities.  The editorial comes a day after the newspaper </p><p>      (08/06) published a story in which Home Affairs Minister </p><p>      John Nkomo is quoted as having said that the government </p><p>      would soon ban NGOs that are abusing the privilege to </p><p>      distribute drought relief supplies to rural communities by </p><p>      "spreading anti-government vitriol" and "misinforming </p><p>      villagers that the food shortages were caused by the on- </p><p>      going land reform program."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.    ". . .It is. . .mind-boggling that some political </p><p>      nonentities are lying to beneficiaries of the drought </p><p>      relief program and suggesting that it was the discredited </p><p>      opposition that was sourcing the food.  It is a pity that </p><p>      these political upstarts have perfected the art of lying to </p><p>      an extent that they even believe their own lies.  We urge </p><p>      the government not to waver in its resolve to flush out </p><p>      rogue NGOs that are being used by imperialists out to </p><p>      discredit it and divide the people of this country. </p><p>      President Mugabe has assured the nation that nobody will </p><p>      starve and the government is working tirelessly to ensure </p><p>      that every family has a meal on its table everyday.  Credit </p><p>      for these efforts should not be claimed by rogues who want </p><p>      to make us believe that they are politicians working for </p><p>      the people when their only interest is to line their </p><p>      pockets.  The government should carry out an audit of NGOs </p><p>      in the country and find out whether they are operating </p><p>      within the parameters that they proffered when they applied </p><p>      for registration.  There is no way that we can allow </p><p>      political parties to use NGOs as party structures. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
