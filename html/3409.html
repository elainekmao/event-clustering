<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR R (CROSS, AKATSOULOS), NEA/PPD (JGAFFNEY, </p><p>CBOURGEOIS, MLUSSENHOP), NEA/ARN, NEA (LAROCCO) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, KPAO, KISL, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IAF PRESS RELEASE RESPONDS TO PRESS CRITICISM OF </p><p>MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR ROSS </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Amman 04236 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary.  The July 17 meeting between R Special </p><p>Coordinator Ambassador Christopher Ross and the </p><p>leadership of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) was not </p><p>reported in the IAF\'s weekly Assabeel but received </p><p>considerable attention from other weeklies, including a </p><p>scathing editorial by a former leftist parliamentary </p><p>deputy against the IAF and its mother organization, the </p><p>Muslim Brothers Movement.  This prompted the IAF to issue </p><p>a press release explaining its reasons for accepting the </p><p>meeting with Ambassador Ross and the discussion that took </p><p>place.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>IAF weekly overlooked meeting, others did not </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>2.   The July 17 meeting between Ambassador Christopher </p><p>Ross and IAF\'s Head of the Shura Council Abdul Latif </p><p>Arabiyat, Secretary-General Sheikh Hamza Mansour, and </p><p>Deputy Secretary-General Jamil Abu Bakr (reported </p><p>separately) was not reported in Assabeel, the independent </p><p>Arabic weekly that reflects the views of the IAF party. </p><p>This, however, did not prevent independent weekly Al- </p><p>Hadath from reporting on the meeting in its July 22 </p><p>edition.  The report included a quote from Arabiyat that </p><p>said:  "We outlined to the Ambassador our positions on </p><p>the biased American policies, and the reasons for the </p><p>enmity that the street in Jordan and other Arab and </p><p>Muslim countries feels towards American policies."  The </p><p>Al-Hadath article also stated that "Arabiyat expressed no </p><p>anxiety that such a meeting might give rise to </p><p>accusations of any sort against the party.  He said: `Our </p><p>positions and our principles are clear. Any judgement </p><p>should be passed on our statements and our positions in </p><p>such meetings, not on the meeting itself because dialoge </p><p>is a requirement.\'"  A similar article also appeared in </p><p>the centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times in its July 26-27 edition. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Criticism from East-Bank nationalist weekly </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>3.   On July 25, Shihan, a sensationalist East-Bank </p><p>nationalist weekly of negligible circulation, criticized </p><p>the meeting and described it as coinciding with "the </p><p>escalating American campaign against Arab and Muslim </p><p>countries under pretext of fighting terrorism."  Shihan </p><p>also charged that the meeting took place "behind the back </p><p>of the Government of Jordan," which "prompted some </p><p>political activists to call on the government to ask </p><p>embassies to refrain from meeting unofficial </p><p>organizations without the knowledge of the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs."  Mansour also was quoted in Shihan as </p><p>saying: "[The Americans] hear weak words from officials, </p><p>and we wanted to express to them the conscience of the </p><p>Muslim street towards American policies . We stressed to </p><p>them that U.S. terrorism is an aggression against Islam </p><p>and Muslims, that we are not fooled by Bush\'s visit to a </p><p>mosque because we base our positions on official U.S. </p><p>policies and practices." </p><p> </p><p>4.   Shihan also included a commentary by Hamadeh </p><p>Fara\'neh, former parliamentary deputy and former activist </p><p>of the Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of </p><p>Palestine (DFLP).  In it Fara\'neh charged that the Muslim </p><p>Brothers Movement (MB) and its offshoot party the IAF </p><p>have a long history of coordination with the U.S. against </p><p>Muslim states led by liberation movements, which reached </p><p>its peak when the MB mobilized Arab Muslim youth to fight </p><p>the Soviets in Afghanistan, thereby distracting them </p><p>"away from Palestine and from the battle to defend our </p><p>national and religious existence against the Israeli </p><p>enemy." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Press release in Arabic dailies </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5.   On Sunday July 28, all Arabic dailies reported </p><p>excerpts from a press release circulated by IAF Secretary- </p><p>General Hamza Mansour, in which he stressed that "the </p><p>meeting addressed the question posed by Ambassador Ross: </p><p>"Why has the U.S. failed to persuade Muslims that its war </p><p>is against terror not Islam and Muslims?"  It said that </p><p>speakers explained: "Muslims\' hatred of America springs </p><p>from its policy that provides weapons, political cover, </p><p>and international support to the Zionist enemy, including </p><p>covering up for this enemy\'s crimes.  [They also spring] </p><p>from the U.S. aggression against Iraq, its support for </p><p>dictatorial corrupt regimes, and its continuous </p><p>incitement against Islamist movements, which it describes </p><p>as terrorists." </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
