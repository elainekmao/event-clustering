<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000590 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Finance Head Dislikes Price Controls </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: During a meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Sullivan, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa agreed that </p><p>economic intervention has gone too far.  He expressed </p><p>hope that he and other GOZ moderates will be able to push </p><p>through reforms that reach beyond last month\'s </p><p>devaluation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Less International Support? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Amb Sullivan recounted that the U.S. has </p><p>provided about US$ 130 million total assistance to </p><p>Zimbabwe during the past year.  With the possibility </p><p>looming that only Zimbabwe among southern African </p><p>countries will continue to suffer significant food </p><p>deficiency, he stressed the need for meaningful economic </p><p>reform and better coordination between the donor </p><p>community and the GOZ\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB). </p><p>Murerwa concurred that Zimbabwe will require some degree </p><p>of food assistance, probably in Masvingo as well as </p><p>Matabeleland North and South.  He said he was "unhappy" </p><p>that the GOZ still subsidized maize-meal "at a horrendous </p><p>rate."  Against Agriculture Minister Joseph Made\'s </p><p>opposition, Murerwa told us he has proposed raising the </p><p>price of maize and allowing the import of white maize at </p><p>market value.  (Note: There is presently little incentive </p><p>for producers to sell grain to the GMB at controlled </p><p>prices.) </p><p> </p><p>3 Bilateral Friction Points </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) Expropriations of Amcit Properties:  Amb </p><p>Sullivan protested the GOZ\'s unlawful seizure of land </p><p>belonging to five U.S. citizens under fast-track land </p><p>reform, requesting Murerwa\'s intercession.  The Finance </p><p>Minister agreed to look at the cases and accepted copies </p><p>of the Embassy\'s notes verbal to date. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Enfeebled Democracy:  Murerwa expressed regret </p><p>that the land issue had soured bilateral relations.  Amb </p><p>Sullivan countered that the USG had long supported land </p><p>redistribution within a legal framework.  He argued that </p><p>the USG was most concerned with Zimbabwe\'s undemocratic </p><p>elections last March and deteriorating human rights </p><p>record.  Murerwa insisted repeatedly that the GOZ\'s main </p><p>conflict was with the United Kingdom and not domestic </p><p>opposition.  He expressed outrage at alleged opposition </p><p>violence in the just-concluded two-day national strike. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Financial Sanctions:  Amb Sullivan gave Murerwa </p><p>a copy of the March 6 executive order authorizing </p><p>financial sanctions against Zimbabwe\'s leaders.  Murerwa </p><p>asked whether sanctions extended to businesses owned by </p><p>listed Zimbabweans.  The Ambassador told him the USG has </p><p>yet to define these parameters. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (SBU) Murerwa shares customary ZANU-PF biases, blaming </p><p>the UK -- rather than suppression of opposition and rule- </p><p>of-law -- for Zimbabwe\'s estrangement from much of the </p><p>international community.  However, he is decidedly among </p><p>GOZ moderates, more empirical than ideological, who are </p><p>working quietly to rationalize economic policies.  We </p><p>have no doubt the Harvard-trained educator recognizes </p><p>that the GOZ has gone overboard on self-destructive price </p><p>controls and other statist policies.  He will continue to </p><p>lobby gingerly for liberalization and against cabinet </p><p>hard-liners, probably with mixed results. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
