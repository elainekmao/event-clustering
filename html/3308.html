<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), DRL/IRF (FARR) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KIRF, PHUM, VT, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN CONCERNED BY DRAFT RUSSIAN VISA RULES </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 2239 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: D. BRENT HARDT, CDA, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C)  SUMMARY:  VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE </p><p>TOLD DCM JULY 12 THAT A NEW RUSSIAN DRAFT LAW ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>WORKER VISAS COULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO OPERATE IN RUSSIA.  FOR EXAMPLE, MIGLIORE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S OPERATIONS IN IRKUTSK </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO CEASE IF THE LAWS WERE TO PASS IN ITS CURRENT </p><p>FORM, AND OTHER AREAS WOULD BE IMPEDED GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03492  151244Z </p><p>RUSSIAN PRIESTS NATIONWIDE.  THE VATICAN IS STILL SEEKING TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER THIS DRAFT HAS HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>OR IS THE WORK OF THE BUREAUCRACY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING INCOMING DCM\'S JULY 12 COURTESY CALL ON </p><p>VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, MIGLIORE RAISED HIS CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF DRAFT RUSSIAN RELIGIOUS VISA LAWS </p><p>THAT WOULD REQUIRE RELIGIOUS WORKERS TO LEAVE RUSSIA EVERY </p><p>THREE MONTHS TO RENEW THEIR STATUS.  HE SAID IT USUALLY TAKES </p><p>A MONTH FOR THOSE VISAS TO BE PROCESSED, AND WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>PRIESTS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS WORKERS FROM POLAND, THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN TO LEAVE THEIR </p><p>PARISHES FOR ONE MONTH OUT OF EVERY FOUR AT GREAT EXPENSE AND </p><p>LOSS OF TIME. IN EFFECT, HE SAID, THE DECREE IS "JUST LIKE </p><p>SAYING CLOSE DOWN YOUR ACTIVITIES."  MIGLIORE WAS ALSO </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE GOR HAS LISTED A FURTHER 15 RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS "TO BE EXPELLED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ASKED WHETHER BISHOP MAZUR (PREVIOUSLY DENIED A VISA </p><p>TO RETURN TO THE DIOCESE OF SAKHALIN -- SEE REFTEL) HAD HEARD </p><p>ANY NEWS ABOUT THE RENEWAL OF HIS VISA, MIGLIORE SAID THE </p><p>HOLY SEE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD FROM THE GOR THE LEGAL BASIS FOR </p><p>HIS VISA REFUSAL.  MAZUR CONTINUES TO COOL HIS HEELS IN </p><p>POLAND.  HE INDICATED THAT THERE IS A REAL RISK THAT THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S ACTIVITIES IN IRKUTSK WOULD HAVE TO CEASE </p><p>IF MAZUR DOESN\'T GET HIS VISA AND IF THE NEW DECREE COMES </p><p>INTO FORCE.  HE SAID THAT WHEN THE HOLY SEE ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>DISCUSS THESE ISSUES IN MOSCOW, THEY ARE TOLD THAT "LOWER </p><p>LEVEL OFFICIALS" ARE RESPONSIBLE, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S CLERGY ARE STILL DENIED THE CHANCE TO CONDUCT THEIR </p><p>PASTORAL WORK. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03492  151244Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  COMMENT:   MIGLIORE\'S COMMENTS ABOUT THIS NEW RUSSIAN </p><p>DECREE INDICATED A NEW LEVEL OF CONCERN WITHIN THE VATICAN </p><p>FOR THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN RUSSIA.  MIGLIORE RAISED THE </p><p>ISSUE IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE HOLY SEE\'S CURRENT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES, GIVING IT TOP BILLING.  THE NEW </p><p>DRAFT LAW COMES ON THE HEELS OF A VITUPERATIVE STATEMENT BY </p><p>THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH\'S SPOKESMAN FOR EXTERNAL </p><p>RELATIONS, ARCHPRIEST VSEVOLOD CHAPLIN JULY 5 IN WHICH HE </p><p>CONDEMNED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S COMPETITIVE APPROACH AS </p><p>"EXPANSION AT ANY PRICE," AND ASSERTED THAT THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH HAS HAD "ALMOST ZERO SUCCESS."  WE WOULD APPRECIATE </p><p>EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S TAKE ON WHETHER THERE IS A REAL THREAT THAT </p><p>THE CHURCH\'S OPERATIONS COULD BE "SHUT DOWN" OR OTHERWISE </p><p>SERIOUSLY IMPEDED BY THE NEW DRAFT LAW AND WHETHER THIS </p><p>REPRESENTS A NEW ESCALATION IN THE TENSE RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO CHURCHES.  WITH VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>RUSSIAN/NIS ISSUES ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO SOON TO RETIRE, THE </p><p>VATICAN IS THIN ON PERSONNEL AND NOT WELL POSITIONED TO PUSH </p><p>ITS INTEREST IN THIS AREA. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03492 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
