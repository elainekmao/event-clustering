ABUJA 1025 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 400 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 205 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a June 11 meeting, President Obasanjo and </p><p>Ambassador discussed GON efforts to address U.S. concerns </p><p>over the October 2001 Benue incident.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>noted that Nigeria had lost USD 12.8 million in </p><p>"opportunity" bilateral security assistance because of </p><p>Congressional sanctions.  Obasanjo said he had recently </p><p>received a copy of the Commission of Inquiry\'s report, but </p><p>had not read it yet.  When the Ambassador commented that we </p><p>had heard the report did not indict specific individuals </p><p>(REF A), Obasanjo exclaimed, "We cannot do more than we </p><p>have done.  If this will break our relationship, so be it." </p><p>(COMMENT: Obasanjo gave the Ambassador his copy of the </p><p>report from which we confirmed that the Commission did not </p><p>recommend criminal prosecution against any specifically </p><p>identified individuals.  The Commission\'s mandate did not </p><p>extend to the initiation of criminal proceedings - it could </p><p>only make recommendations.  Even this, it did not do.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Obasanjo and recently appointed Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff GEN Alexander Ogomudia, who also attended the </p><p>meeting, were adamant on this issue.  During an aside </p><p>before Obasanjo arrived, Ogomudia told the Ambassador that </p><p>he wished he could speak with the members of Congress "who </p><p>still have misgivings about Zaki-Biam."  Alluding to recent </p><p>U.S. military action in Iraq where innocent civilians were </p><p>killed or seriously injured, Ogomudia said that sometimes </p><p>governments had to take actions that inevitably hurt </p><p>innocent people.  The GON had to respond with force in </p><p>Zaki-Biam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: This line of reasoning has been the GON\'s </p><p>constant refrain.  While most government officials will </p><p>acknowledge the soldiers at Zaki-Biam went much too far, </p><p>they are loathe to hold specific individuals culpable </p><p>because, in the final analysis, they believe the military </p><p>had to act.  Moreover, an attempt to indict soldiers might </p><p>cause unrest in the barracks and this is something Obasanjo </p><p>has to avoid.  While Obasanjo was concerned about the </p><p>effects of Congressional sanctions on bilateral security </p><p>assistance, his statements indicate that he will not </p><p>personally intervene further on the Benue issue.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
