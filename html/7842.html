(U) Press sources put the toll from the Bingol </p><p>earthquake at 167 killed and 521 injuries.  Rescue </p><p>operations were concluded on Sunday, May 4.  At the </p><p>Celtiksuyu Boarding School, GOT rescue teams saved 114 </p><p>students from the wreckage but 84 students and one </p><p>teacher were killed.  Riots also appear to have ceased. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Turkish Red Crescent distributed 6500 tents in </p><p>the province, including 1100 tents disbursed to the </p><p>villages.  Press reports state that 82 houses collapsed </p><p>and 1100 additional homes are in uninhabitable condition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The national press is full of stories suggesting </p><p>some of the damage - specifically the collapse of the </p><p>boarding school - was the result of shoddy construction, </p><p>which in turn is linked to corruption.  An official from </p><p>the Turkish Chamber of Architects and Engineers, who went </p><p>to the site to look into these claims, is quoted as </p><p>saying the "placement of the building was wrong, the </p><p>construction techniques were wrong, and the concrete used </p><p>was extremely weak."  Bingol Governor Huseyin Cos, one of </p><p>the main targets of last Friday\'s violent demonstrations, </p><p>has promised a full investigation into the school\'s </p><p>construction.  Press reports quote Bulent Arinc, Turkish </p><p>Parliament Speaker, calling for the prosecution of those </p><p>responsible for the shoddy construction of the school. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
