<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 003576 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/29/08 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: HUGO CHAVEZ\'S PLAN TO TRANSFORM VENEZUELA:  PART I </p><p> </p><p>REF: CARACAS 03282 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR, REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, HUGO CHAVEZ\'S POLITICAL PARTY, THE </p><p>FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT (MVR) PUBLISHED ITS PLAN OF ACTION </p><p>(REFTEL).  THIS DOCUMENTED WAS UPDATED IN OCTOBER WHEN CHAVEZ </p><p>RELEASED HIS "PLAN TO TRANSFORM VENEZUELA." </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  CHAVEZ\'S PLAN CONSISTS OF FIVE-PARTS: </p><p> </p><p>--  POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM - THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>--  SOCIAL EQUILIBRIUM - SOCIAL JUSTICE </p><p>--  ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM - COMPETITIVE, BUT HUMANE ECONOMIC PLANS </p><p>--  TERRITORIAL EQUILIBRIUM - DECENTRALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>--  GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM - GLOBALIZATION AND SOVEREIGNTY </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF 5 MESSAGES THAT WILL </p><p>SUMMARIZE AND ANALYZE CHAVEZ\'S PLAN.  THIS INSTALLMENT WILL EXAMINE </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S PLAN FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (CONSTITUYENTE). </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE CALL FOR THE CONSTITUYENTE: </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  CHAVEZ ARGUES THAT THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL SYSTEM IS </p><p>CORRUPT AND MORALLY BANKRUPT AND BLOCKS ANY EFFORT TO CHANGE IT. </p><p>ONLY THROUGH A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM CAN </p><p>VENEZUELA ACHIEVE GREATNESS.  THIS TRANSFORMATION REQUIRES A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, WHICH CHAVEZ PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THROUGH A </p><p>NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (CONSTITUYENTE). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  THE CONSTITUYENTE WILL WIELD ITS TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER NOT </p><p>JUST POLITICALLY (INSURING A REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS), BUT ALSO </p><p>ECONOMICALLY (INSURING A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE ECONOMY), SOCIALLY </p><p>(INSURING SOCIAL JUSTICE AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT) AND JURIDICALLY </p><p>(INSURING AN IMPARTIAL LEGAL SYSTEM).  IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THE </p><p>POSITIVE CHANGES ENVISIONED BY CHAVEZ ARISE FROM THE CONSTITUYENTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CONSTITUYENTE PROCESS: </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  THE PROCESS WILL CONSIST OF 5 DISTINCT PHASES:  ACTIVATION, </p><p>CONTRACTUAL, CONVOCATION, MEETING, AND EXECUTION.  ACTIVATION WILL </p><p>OCCUR UPON THE ELECTION OF CHAVEZ AS PRESIDENT.  THIS WILL BE </p><p>QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY THE CONTRACTUAL PHASE, WHEREBY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ </p><p>CALLS FOR A POPULAR REFERENDUM.  THE CONVOCATION OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUYENTE, PHASE 3, WILL BE THE REFERENDUM.  THE ACTUAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY AND AGREEMENT TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL BE PHASE 4, AND </p><p>THE RATIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL </p><p>END THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  THE CONSTITUYENTE WILL BE A UNICAMERAL, REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BODY, WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT THAT "WILL FORTIFY </p><p>AND DEVELOP THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL GUARANTEE PUBLIC FREEDOM, </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, AND REINSTITUTE A PARTICIPATIVE SYSTEM."  THE MEMBERS </p><p>WILL BE ELECTED BY POPULAR VOTE, AND THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>FOR EACH STATE WILL BE BASED ON THE POPULATION OF THAT STATE.  THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY SHOULD HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.  NO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE CAN BE A CURRENT ELECTED OFFICIAL, JUDGE, OR UNION </p><p>PRESIDENT.  FINALLY, THE MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE IMMUNITY DURING THEIR </p><p>TENURE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  ONCE THE ASSEMBLY COMPLETES ITS DELIBERATIONS AND PREPARES </p><p>A NEW CONSTITUTION, THE FINAL PRODUCT MUST BE APPROVED BY A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF VOTERS.  DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD, THE EXISTING </p><p>CONSTITUTION WILL REMAIN IN FORCE, UNLESS THE CONSTITUYENTE DECIDES </p><p>OTHERWISE.  IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE CONSTITUYENTE WANTS, IT CAN </p><p>DISSOLVE THE CONGRESS, REORGANIZE THE JUDICIARY, AND MODIFY THE </p><p>STRUCTURE AND TERM OF OFFICE FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH; IT WILL HAVE </p><p>COMPLETE POWER.  (NOTE.  CHAVEZ HAS DENIED THAT THE CONSTITUYENTE </p><p>WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE POWER, BUT HAS NOT INDICATED WHAT MECHANISM </p><p>WOULD LIMIT THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUYENTE.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT WILL THE NEW CONSTITUTION DO? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL: </p><p> </p><p>--  REDEFINE THE EXECUTIVE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN A MORE </p><p>PARTICIPATORY MANNER AND ALLOW FOR DEMONSTRATIONS OF PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN THE FORM OF REFERENDA. </p><p> </p><p>--  MAKE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL.  JUDGES </p><p>WILL BE POPULARLY ELECTED, INSTEAD OF APPOINTED BY CONGRESS. </p><p>BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CLOGGED BY SMALL MATTERS, THE NEW </p><p>SYSTEM SHOULD ALLOW FOR ALTERNATE SETTLEMENT METHODS, SUCH AS, </p><p>MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION. </p><p> </p><p>--  CREATE A TRULY REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH THROUGH DIRECT </p><p>ELECTIONS (PARTY LISTS AND PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WILL BE DONE </p><p>AWAY WITH) AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH RECALL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--  ESTABLISH A NEW, FOURTH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE MORAL BRANCH. </p><p>THIS BRANCH WOULD CONSIST OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AN </p><p>OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT ROLE: THE CONTROLLER GENERAL AND THE </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL.  IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CREATION OF A NEW </p><p>OFFICER, THE OMBUDSMAN, AND A COORDINATING BODY FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT, THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, </p><p>THE CONTROLLER GENERAL, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.  THE MORAL BRANCH </p><p>WILL BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GUARANTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHARACTER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTERACT BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE </p><p>STATE.  THESE WOULD INCLUDE POLITICAL PARTIES, UNIONS, AND BUSINESS </p><p>OR PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.  IT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO INSURE THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MUST TAKE ON A WATCHDOG ROLE FOR </p><p>SOCIETY.  IT MUST ANALYZE, PLAN, AND EVALUATE THE BEST WAY TO </p><p>MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER AND WELL-BEING.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, CHAVEZ WANTS </p><p>A DECENTRALIZED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WITH FEWER MINISTRIES. </p><p>LIKEWISE, IT MUST HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION TO DEAL WITH MARKET CRASHES </p><p>OR DETERIORATIONS OF THE BUSINESS CLIMATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.(C)  THIS FIRST PART OF CHAVEZ\'S PLAN FOLLOWS CLOSELY THAT WHICH </p><p>WAS LAID OUT IN THE MVR PLAN OF ACTION (REFTEL).  WHILE HE EXPOUNDS </p><p>IN GREATER DETAIL HIS VISION OF THE CONSTITUYENTE, HE DOES NOT </p><p>ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY HIS PROPOSAL FOR DRAMATIC </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  SPECIFICALLY, HE SIDESTEPS THE MEANS BY </p><p>WHICH A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD BE CONVOKED (THE CURRENT </p><p>CONSTITUTION DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY), THE ROLE OF A </p><p>REFERENDUM IN BUILDING POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY (THE ELECTORAL LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE REFERENDUM TO </p><p>INVALIDATE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED RIGHTS), OR THE MEANS BY </p><p>WHICH MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD BE ELECTED </p><p>(CURRENT ELECTORAL LAW REQUIRES A MIXED SYSTEM OF DIRECT AND </p><p>PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION).  NONE OF THESE ISSUES IS </p><p>INSURMOUNTABLE.  A CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS TO REFORM THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>EXISTS--THROUGH THE CONGRESS RE-WRITING THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN </p><p>PRESENTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION TO THE PEOPLE FOR APPROVAL OR </p><p>DISAPPROVAL IN A REFERENDUM.  FURTHERMORE, A MEANS TO ACCOMMODATE </p><p>A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WITHIN THE CURRENT ORDER CAN BE </p><p>FASHIONED--THROUGH AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION TO PERMIT THE </p><p>CONVOCATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAVEZ\'S UNWILLINGNESS </p><p>TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN HIS PLAN OF ACTION UNDERSCORES THE </p><p>POLITICAL NATURE OF HIS PROPOSAL:  IT IS DESIGNED FIRST AND </p><p>FOREMOST AS A POLITICAL MARKETING TOOL TO HIGHLIGHT HIS DESIRE TO </p><p>COMPLETELY REFORM GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS IN VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
