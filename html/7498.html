<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, CASC, YM, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1Z01: SANAA EAC MEETING APRIL 16 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  The Ambassador convened an Emergency </p><p>Action Committee (EAC) meeting on April 16 to assess Embassy </p><p>security posture and threat information.  The EAC decided to </p><p>return to normal operations on April 19, and to formally </p><p>request the cancellation of authorized departure -- to </p><p>include the return of dependents to post.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)   Key offices and personnel represented at the </p><p>4/16 EAC meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, CONS, DCM, FPD, OMC, </p><p>ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new threat information. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  RSO reported that there is no information on </p><p>planned demonstrations this weekend.  RSO will monitor the </p><p>situation and alert the Embassy community as warranted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Imminent Suspension of MoveSafe Light </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Noting the end of major combat operations in Iraq, </p><p>A/DCM raised two issues for EAC\'s consideration: ending </p><p>MoveSafe Lite and returning to normal operations; and </p><p>formally requesting an end to authorized departure.  RSO </p><p>reported a request from the Ministry of Interior (MOI) for </p><p>USG personnel to maintain the current level of security </p><p>practices for 4-5 more days.  MOI recognizes that the </p><p>situation in Yemen is improving considering the events in the </p><p>region, but feels that a few more days of heightened security </p><p>will allow for a greater easing of Yemeni popular opinion. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Regarding possible threats to the community, EAC </p><p>discussed an MOI report of a road incident in which shots </p><p>were fired at a Jordanian diplomat.  While the Jordanians </p><p>believe their diplomat was specifically targeted, eye witness </p><p>statements describe a vehicular confrontation ending in </p><p>gunfire -- one shot fired into the air and one into the </p><p>Jordanian\'s car.  The shot into the car impacted away from </p><p>the Jordanian diplomat.  His vehicle did not have diplomatic </p><p>plates.  The MOI is assessing this episode as a road-rage </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Unless credible new threat information becomes </p><p>available, EAC agreed to go off of MoveSafe Lite on Saturday, </p><p>April 19. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Cancellation of Authorized Departure </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Referring to an April 15 meeting in Washington to </p><p>review the status of posts in the Gulf, A/DCM noted that the </p><p>Department welcomes recommendations from posts in the region </p><p>on whether to continue with authorized/ordered departure. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  EAC decided to formally request the lifting of </p><p>authorized departure (AD) with attendees noting the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p>--  Informal polling of embassy personnel revealed general </p><p>support for lifting AD because no one at post has used it; </p><p>however, several post personnel have mentioned a perceived </p><p>disconnect between returning to regular staffing while </p><p>maintaining increased security. </p><p> </p><p>--  Addressing the "disconnect", attendees noted that </p><p>increased security and use of armored vehicles has brought </p><p>post to its target security posture.  This security will </p><p>remain in place, even while ending AD, to deter future </p><p>threats. </p><p> </p><p>--  AD complicates the day-to-day life of a mission, in </p><p>particular with respect to travel of personnel to and from </p><p>post, and, if no longer required by local and regional </p><p>circumstances, should be discontinued as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Return of Dependents </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>10.  (C)  Turning to the issue of dependents at post, EAC </p><p>members noted that a year ago, given circumstances in Yemen, </p><p>the Department decided to allow spouses but no minor </p><p>dependents to return to post.  With regional circumstances </p><p>changing after the end of combat operations in Iraq - and </p><p>with improving security conditions in Yemen - EAC members </p><p>agreed to request that in conjunction with the lifting of </p><p>authorized departure, the Department also approve the return </p><p>of minor dependents to Sanaa -- as it presumably may be doing </p><p>for other posts in the region. </p><p>11.  (C)  Foreigners in Yemen have been targeted no more than </p><p>at other posts in the region, and heightened security </p><p>measures and ROYG\'s continued cooperation have been </p><p>effective.  The Department\'s concurrence on the return of </p><p>dependents to post in the near future would also give </p><p>families the chance to make preparations without interfering </p><p>with their children\'s education. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Escape of Ten Suspected Terrorists </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF)  EAC also discussed the security implications of </p><p>the escape of 10 suspected al-Qaida terrorists from a ROYG </p><p>facility in Aden with FPD rep raising the possibility that </p><p>these 10 could pose an increased threat.  Noting that the USG </p><p>was principally interested in 2 of the 10 for further </p><p>investigation and prosecution, ORCA indicated that the other </p><p>8 are not key terrorist activists, while they still merit </p><p>observation.  ROYG is committed to the swift apprehension of </p><p>the 10 and is working closely with the USG. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
