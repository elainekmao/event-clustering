FBIS SEP20020716000011  B. HANOI 1780 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.

THE CC </p><p>ALSO RECOMMENDED TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE TWO BE FORMALLY </p><p>DISMISSED FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS AS WELL.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF </p><p>THE JULY 4-15 SIXTH PLENUM DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE REASON </p><p>FOR THE DISMISSALS FROM THE CC OF GENERAL HUY AND DG HANH. </p><p>IT NOTED THAT HUY, AS THEN-HO CHI MINH CITY POLICE CHIEF, </p><p>"DID NOT FULFILL HIS TASKS" AND "WAS IRRESPONSIBLE IN </p><p>LEADERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND USE OF CADRES, THUS LETTING THEM </p><p>BECOME CO-OFFENDERS IN THE TRUONG NAM CAM CASE."   HANH </p><p>HELPED "TO RELEASE UNTRUE AND IRRESPONSIBLE INFORMATION," </p><p>AND ALSO "VIOLATED THE PRESS LAW TO DEFEND TRUONV VAN CAM." </p><p>BOTH HUY AND HANH WERE ALSO BLAMED WITH HAVING MAINTAINING </p><p>RELATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF "BAD ELEMENTS" OVER A LONG TIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U)  THE CC RECOMMENDED THAT THE GVN RELIEVE HUY OF HIS </p><p>VICE MINISTERIAL POSITION AS WELL AS DEMOTE HIM FROM </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL TO MAJOR GENERAL.  IT SIMILARLY </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THE GVN REMOVE HANH OFFICIALLY FROM HIS </p><p>POST AS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE VOICE OF VIETNAM AND THAT </p><p>THE VIETNAM JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION DROP HIM AS VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND GENERAL SECRETARY.  IN MAY, HANH HAD BEEN </p><p>TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED FROM THOSE POSTS AS WELL AS FORCED TO </p><p>RESIGN AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, FOLLOWING A </p><p>POLITBURO RECOMMENDATION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01795  161049Z </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U)  SOME PRESS REPORTS NOTED THAT HUY WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>VERY FEW HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS TO BE DISMISSED FOR "LACK OF </p><p>SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY," AND COMMENTED HOW COVERAGE OF HIS </p><p>AND HANH\'S CASES CONTRASTED WITH THE DISMISSAL OF THEN- </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGO XUON LOC OVER ALLEGED FRAUD IN THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF A HANOI WATER PARK IN THE LATE 1990S.  SOME </p><p>MEDIA COMMENTARY CLAIMED THAT THE CPV WAS TRYING TO PORTRAY </p><p>ITS HANDLING OF HANH, HUY, AND OTHERS IN THE NAM CAM CASE AS </p><p>AN EXAMPLE OF ITS DETERMINATION TO COMBAT CORRUPTION AND </p><p>OTHER KINDS OF SOCIAL EVILS THAT HAVE BEEN "JEOPARDIZING THE </p><p>ETHICS" OF MANY CIVIL SERVANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  SPEAKING AT THE PLENUM, CPV GENERAL SECRETARY NONG </p><p>DUC MANH ADMITTED THAT SOME SENIOR OFFICIALS HAD BEEN </p><p>"BOUGHT," EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY SHOWN </p><p>"REVOLUTIONARY FIRMNESS" AND HAD MADE "MANY CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>DURING WARTIME."  MANH STRESSED THAT CADRES "AT ALL </p><p>ECHELONS" MUST FOLLOW PARTY STATUTES AND STATE LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  OFFICIAL MEDIA COVERAGE ALSO NOTED THAT THE PLENUM\'S </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON PARTY DISCIPLINE HAD BEEN HELD IN A "HIGHLY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC AND CANDID ATMOSPHERE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  COMMENT:  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE PLENUM WAS </p><p>PERHAPS LIVELIER THAN THE NORM AND THAT THE CPV DECIDED TO </p><p>OFFER UP SOME SACRIFICIAL LAMBS IN ORDER TO TRY TO CONVINCE </p><p>THE PUBLIC THAT THE CPV IS SERIOUS ABOUT COMBATING </p><p>CORRUPTION WITHIN ITS SENIOR RANKS.  WHAT REMAINS UNCLEAR IS </p><p>WHETHER THE HUNT FOR CULPRITS IN THE NAM CAM AND OTHER </p><p>SENSITIVE CASES HAS CONCLUDED WITH THESE DISMISSALS OR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01795  161049Z </p><p>WHETHER OTHER HIGH-LEVEL VICTIMS WILL FOLLOW.  IT REMAINS </p><p>UNLIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT THE CPV WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE A </p><p>CREDIBLE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE TO THE </p><p>SATISFACTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
