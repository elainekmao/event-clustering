(C) WITH RESPECT TO PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S COMMENTS ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE(REFTEL), WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE LAND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM AND CALL </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE INCREASED VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH THREATEN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WHILE THE ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>GAVE PRIORITY TO RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LAND </p><p>REFORM PROCESS, IT ALSO CALLED FOR RESPECT FOR HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.  ORGANIZATION OF AN </p><p>ELECTION, WHICH IS PERCEIVED DOMESTICALLY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY AS FREE AND FAIR, AND WHOSE RESULTS WILL </p><p>BE ACCEPTED AS LEGITIMATE, IS CRITICAL FOR ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FUTURE.  THUS FAR, THE OPPOSITE HAS BEEN THE TREND AND </p><p>THE ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF ALL OF AFRICA\'S DEMOCRATICALLY </p><p>ELECTED LEADERS IN PRESSING FOR RESPECT FOR HUMAN AND </p><p>CIVIC RIGHTS AND A FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IS EXTREMELY </p><p>IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>ON LAND </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) SINCE THE ABUJA AGREEMENT, THE GOZ HAS STATED </p><p>REPEATEDLY THAT IT HAS COMPLIED FULLY WITH ITS ABUJA </p><p>COMMITMENTS, WHILE FAULTING THE UK AND OTHER POTENTIAL </p><p>DONORS FOR NOT PROVIDING "PROMISED" SUPPORT.  THE REPORT </p><p>OF THE UNDP-LED MISSION FOCUSED ON LAND ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>ABUJA AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS WEEK.  WHILE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE TEAM, LED BY UNDP AFRICA DIRECTOR ABDOULIE </p><p>JANNEH, FOUND MANY FLAWS IN THE LAND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00050  071141Z </p><p>PROCESS AND DOCUMENTED AN ENORMOUS DECLINE IN ACREAGE </p><p>BEING TILLED DUE TO THE CHAOTIC NATURE OF THE LAND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. SUBJECT TO ENORMOUS GOZ PRESSURE, </p><p>THE UNDP-LED TEAM REFRAINED FROM RELEASING A FORMAL </p><p>REPORT DURING THEIR VISIT, BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THE FINAL </p><p>REPORT TO SPEAK POLITELY, BUT FRANKLY, ABOUT THE MANY </p><p>FLAWS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) THE GOZ\'S BOAST THAT ITS LAND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM </p><p>IS NOW TOTALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IS </p><p>BASED PRINCIPALLY ON THE CONTROVERSIAL JUDGMENT OF THE </p><p>RECONFIGURED SUPREME COURT REVERSING AN EARLIER SUPREME </p><p>COURT DECISION. WHETHER LEGAL UNDER NEW GOZ LEGISLATION </p><p>AND COURT RULINGS OR NOT, LAND DISTRIBUTION IS BEING </p><p>CARRIED OUT IN A LARGELY OPAQUE MANNER AND, IN MANY </p><p>CASES, TO THE BENEFIT OF ZANU-PF INSIDERS.  THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS NGO FORUM, A GROUP OF TEN PROMINENT NGO\'S </p><p>PUBLISHED ON DEC 17 A REPORT ON THE ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>(FOUND IN WWW:ZWNEWS.COM/ABUJA3.COM ).

THE REPORT OFFERS SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>DOCUMENTATION OF ITS ASSERTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) REGARDING THE GOZ\'S COMMITMENTS TO RESPECT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, THE ZIMBABWE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS NGO FORUM (OP. CIT.) CONCLUDED THAT, BEGIN QUOTE: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00050  071141Z </p><p>THE GOZ IS TAKING STEPS INIMICAL TO ITS ABUJA </p><p>COMMITMENTS. THE GOZ ACTIONS SUGGEST THAT IT INTENDS TO </p><p>HOLD ELECTIONS AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF ORGANIZED </p><p>VIOLENCE AND TORTURE AND WITHIN A FRAMEWORK INIMICAL TO </p><p>COMMON STANDARDS FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. END QUOTE </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) THESE ISSUES GO BEYOND DIFFERENCES OVER ELECTION </p><p>RULES OR ELECTION OBSERVATION.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS, AT LEAST FIVE OPPOSITION MDC ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>KILLED BY SUCH GANGS. IN ADDITION, THE GOZ HAS </p><p>INTRODUCED NEW LEGISLATION WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR HEAVY </p><p>STATE LIMITS ON  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, INTRODUCE NEW </p><p>PENALTIES IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SECURITY AND MAKE THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTROL BY LIMITING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
