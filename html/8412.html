<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001011 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PARTISAN RIVALRY MAY PREVENT CONSENSUS ON </p><p>INTERIM PM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0999 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0991 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 0814 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> ------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  It seems unlikely that the seven political parties </p><p>will be able to offer King Gyanendra a consensus candidate </p><p>for Prime Minister by the June 2 deadline he gave them on May </p><p>30 (Ref A).  Three smaller parties--each of whom is pressing </p><p>its own leader as a potential PM--might succeed in </p><p>undermining the nomination of Madhav Nepal, the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) General </p><p>Secretary, who has emerged as the preferred candidate of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>four other parties.  Some politicians interpret the King\'s </p><p>inclusion of the three small "spoiler" parties as a </p><p>calculated effort to thwart consensus--thereby allowing him </p><p>to appoint another PM of his own choosing.  However, since </p><p>the political parties have been clamoring for an all-party </p><p>government, the King\'s reasoning that all seven parties ought </p><p>to participate in the process seems justifiable.  The Embassy </p><p>has appealed to all the major political parites to take </p><p>advantage of the King\'s initiative.  That said, the domestic </p><p>political environment may prove too rancorous to permit </p><p>consensus on this matter.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CONSENSUS COUNTDOWN </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  It appears increasingly unlikely that the seven </p><p>major political parties will be able to offer King Gyanendra </p><p>a consensus candidate for interim prime minister by the late </p><p>June 2 deadline he set in his May 30 meeting with them (Ref </p><p>A).  While four of the five political parties who have been </p><p>protesting against the King for more than a month (the Nepali </p><p>Congress; the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist; the People\'s Front Nepal; and the Peasants and </p><p>Workers Party) have agreed to back the nomination of UML </p><p>General Secretary Madhav Nepal, the remaining three parties </p><p>(the National Democratic Party; one faction of the Nepal </p><p>Sadbhavana Party; and former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s Nepali Congress (Democratic)), who have not been </p><p>taking part in the "joint" agitation against the King (Ref </p><p>C), have counter-proposed their own leaders as suitable </p><p>candidates for PM.  Although these three parties together </p><p>account for only about 35 of the 205 MPs in the previous </p><p>Parliament, their intransigence could prove enough to scuttle </p><p>the consensus stipulated by the King--a prospect that some </p><p>Palace critics say the monarch fully anticipated when he </p><p>included them in the all-party meeting on May 30. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  UML leader Nepal told the Charge on June 2 (by cell </p><p>phone as he was leading a protest against the King in </p><p>downtown Kathmandu) that he believes he may be able to </p><p>persuade Deuba, one of the three hold-outs, to back him as a </p><p>second choice.  Nepal was less sanguine about prospects of </p><p>turning the pro-Palace National Democratic Party President </p><p>Pashupati Rana, whose party had 11 MPs in the last </p><p>Parliament, or former Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad </p><p>Mandal, who heads a splinter faction of the Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>Party that can lay claim to only two seats in the same </p><p>Parliament.  If the two smaller parties indeed attempt to </p><p>block his candidacy, Nepal said, the King should be prevailed </p><p>upon to accept the nominee with the largest backing (which </p><p>would be, presumably, Nepal himself).  Nepal asked for the </p><p>Embassy\'s support in pushing this point with the Palace.  He </p><p>also expressed dismay at the sudden visit of a former Indian </p><p>Ambassador to Nepal, whom Nepal clearly perceived as </p><p>anti-UML, and hinted that the Indians might be attempting to </p><p>block him as well.  The Charge emphasized that the USG has no </p><p>favorite candidate for PM but is concerned that the parties </p><p>take advantage of the King\'s efforts toward rapprochement. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) While some critics of the King see his inclusion of </p><p>the three "spoiler" parties as as a sure way to obviate </p><p>consensus, Nepali Congress President G.P. Koirala apparently </p><p>threw his support to erstwhile rival Nepal with the clear </p><p>stipulation that Nepal push for another certain </p><p>deal-breaker--the reinstatement of the Parliament dissolved </p><p>by the King one year ago.  (Note:  The King has already ruled </p><p>out such a step, warning the parties on May 30 not to ask him </p><p>to do anything "unconstitutional."  According to a source at </p><p>the Supreme Court, the proposal to revive an </p><p>already-dissolved Parliament has no constitutional basis. </p><p>End note.)  On June 2 Nepali Congress Central Committee </p><p>member Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat (just before leaving his home to </p><p>participate in a rally against the King) told the Charge that </p><p>the Nepali Congress was demanding the revival of Parliament </p><p>as an essential element of the proposed all-party government, </p><p>adding that his party would accept only one of the leaders of </p><p>the two largest parties--the Nepali Congress or the UML--as </p><p>an interim Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SUSPICIONS, RECRIMINATIONS ABOUND </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Another factor arguing against prospects for a </p><p>workable consensus is the virulent mutual suspicion between </p><p>most of the politcal parties (with the exception of the </p><p>National Democratic Party and the Nepal Sadbhavana faction) </p><p>and the Palace.  Some of this suspicion focuses on the </p><p>institution of the monarchy, buttressed by the Palace </p><p>bureaucracy, in general, which most politicians believe only </p><p>begrudgingly ceded authority after the restoration of </p><p>democracy in 1990.  But even greater suspicion centers on the </p><p>perceived personal leanings of King Gyanendra in particular, </p><p>with many politicians now alleging that he had always </p><p>exhibited more autocratic tendenies than his late brother. </p><p>Whether these suspicions are well-founded or not, the King\'s </p><p>continued exercise of executive authority during the Chand </p><p>government undoubtedly feeds them.  Many political leaders </p><p>who initially supported Chand as a consensus candidate for </p><p>interim Prime Minister last October--with the understanding </p><p>that their parties could nominate members to his Cabinet--say </p><p>they felt betrayed when the King subsequently appointed the </p><p>full Cabinet on his own, claiming the parties\' in-fighting </p><p>and partisanship left him no choice.  Many have expressed </p><p>concern that the King\'s seemingly magnanimous invitation to </p><p>the parties this time may prove a similar ploy.  The King </p><p>knows he is asking the impossible by demanding consensus of </p><p>bitter political rivals like Deuba and Koirala (Koirala </p><p>reportedly will not even enter a room if Deuba is there), </p><p>they argue, and thus runs little risk of having to accept </p><p>their choice for PM. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) We continue to believe that the King\'s offer is a </p><p>significant step toward broadening the representative base of </p><p>government.  (We also expect the June 2 deadline to slip a </p><p>little.)  By giving the parties two options (either </p><p>presenting him with the name of a consensus candidate or </p><p>suggesting several names if consensus continues to elude </p><p>them), the King appears to be making a good-faith effort to </p><p>reach a workable agreement.  Since the political parties have </p><p>been clamoring for an all-party government, it seems </p><p>small-minded--if not downright inconsistent--for them now to </p><p>object to the King\'s inclusion of all seven parties in the </p><p>process.  While we do not know the King\'s motives in offering </p><p>the parties this opening, signals from the Palace indicate </p><p>that he is attempting to respond to concerns from the </p><p>international community.  We find it ironic that the very </p><p>politicians who criticized the King\'s appointment of Chand </p><p>the most vehemently are now devising elaborate justifications </p><p>for their own appointment.  One does not have to hypothesize </p><p>a nefarious royal plot to explain why there remains no </p><p>consensus candidate for PM.  The Embassy will continue to </p><p>urge political leaders to take advantage of this opportunity. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
