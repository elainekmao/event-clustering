O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimdollar Slips Again </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The Zimdollar devalued sharply from Z$ </p><p>1451 to 2100: US$1 last week.  Economists expect it to </p><p>soon reach Z$2500-3000, Harare\'s present desperation </p><p>street price.  As a consequence, it now appears unlikely </p><p>the GOZ will be able to phase out its unaffordable fuel </p><p>subsidy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Z$17:US$1 in 1997 </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2. (U) Since 1998, the Zimdollar has steadily lost value: </p><p> </p><p>1/1/1998 -       17 </p><p>1/1/1999 -       37 </p><p>1/1/2000 -       41 </p><p>1/1/2001 -       71 </p><p>1/1/2002 -      345 </p><p>1/1/2003 -     1605 </p><p>Now      -     2100 : US$1 </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabweans continue to see their salaries rise in </p><p>nominal but fall in real terms, the pronounced earnings </p><p>trend of the past 5 years.  US$ 5/month is an above- </p><p>average salary for domestic workers. The largest </p><p>Zimbabwean bill is now worth less than a quarter.  (The </p><p>GOZ still maintains unsupported official rates of Z$55:1 </p><p>for government transactions and Z$824:1 for </p><p>exporters/tourists/remissions recipients converting forex </p><p>into local currency.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (U) The GOZ\'s recent flooding of parallel markets with </p><p>Zimdollars may has sparked this drop.  However, it is the </p><p>inevitable long-term consequence of poorly conceived </p><p>policies - in particular, expansionary monetary policy, </p><p>export-unfriendly land reform and negative real interest </p><p>rates. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Last week\'s devaluation means the GOZ squandered </p><p>its best shot at eliminating a fuel subsidy, which shrank </p><p>to just 25 percent after the GOZ tripled the regulated </p><p>pump price in April.  Now the subsidy has bounced back to </p><p>over 50 percent; at Z$3000:1, it will be 67 percent.  The </p><p>GOZ has trapped itself in a futile cycle of a) printing </p><p>money to pay subsidies for imported fuel and energy, b) </p><p>weakening the Zimdollar in the process and c) creating a </p><p>heftier subsidy the next time around.  When it raised the </p><p>fuel price to within 25 percent of the actual import </p><p>price last month, the GOZ came close to breaking free of </p><p>the cycle.  By raising fuel from Z$ 450 to 600/liter, </p><p>market forces would have ended a crippling fuel shortage </p><p>and the GOZ would have slowed monetary expansion. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Although the GOZ has brought little new fuel </p><p>into the country, it has reportedly bowed to pressure </p><p>from neighbors and made modest payments toward </p><p>electricity debts.  Recent forex purchases probably paid </p><p>down arrears from South Africa\'s ESKOM and Mozambique\'s </p><p>HCB.  The Financial Gazette, a business weekly, also </p><p>alleges the GOZ is trying to coax Libya\'s Tamoil into new </p><p>fuel donations (packaged as commodity exchanges).  Only </p><p>the largess of others, it seems, postpones the final </p><p>chapter in Zimbabwe\'s economic meltdown. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
