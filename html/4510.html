<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002195 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD FOR IRWIN; AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 11-26-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, KPAO, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  OSLO MEETING REAPS LAVISH, UPBEAT PRESS </p><p>COVERAGE; DEPUTY SECRETARY\'S REMARKS EARN PRAISE </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 2184, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The Oslo meeting on the Sri Lankan </p><p>peace process has received lavish, upbeat press </p><p>coverage.  Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s remarks -- which </p><p>were specifically highlighted in the press coverage -- </p><p>earned special praise.  President Kumaratunga has not </p><p>yet issued a public statement on the meeting, but </p><p>members of her party are planning a rally in Colombo </p><p>today protesting the GSL\'s peace initiative.  Our </p><p>preliminary assessment is that the Oslo meeting provided </p><p>the peace process a solid boost.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>OSLO GARNERS LAVISH, UPBEAT COVERAGE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The November 25 Oslo "Sri Lanka Peace Process </p><p>Support Meeting" received lavish and upbeat press </p><p>coverage back home.  In November 26 newspaper editions, </p><p>coverage was front-page and above-the-fold, with large </p><p>photo spreads.  With most of the focus on </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s remarks (see more in </p><p>Para 6), representative headlines from the major papers </p><p>included: </p><p> </p><p>-- "Daily News" (English):  "U.S. urges LTTE to Renounce </p><p>Terrorism" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Daily Mirror" (English):  "United States urges </p><p>Tigers to Give Up Terror" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Island" (English):  "PM Calls on Global </p><p>Community to Help Lanka Now" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Dinamina" (Sinhala):  "America Says LTTE should </p><p>Publicly Declare that they have Given Up Armed </p><p>Confrontation" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Lankadeepa" (Sinhala):  "Armitage -- LTTE should </p><p>Give Up Idea of Separate State and Armed Struggle" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Most editorials portrayed the Oslo meeting as </p><p>a key boost for the peace process.  The editorial in </p><p>"The Island," a paper that invariably takes a strongly </p><p>anti-peace process tack, did not mention the Oslo </p><p>meeting, however.  (Note:  "The Island" preferred to </p><p>lambaste putative plans by the government to allow a re- </p><p>broadcast on a government radio channel of LTTE leader\'s </p><p>V. Prabhakaran\'s annual "Heroes\' Day" address on </p><p>November 27 -- see Reftel.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Television and radio also provided significant </p><p>coverage of the meeting.  Opening remarks by Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe, Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) special negotiator Anton Balasingham, and </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage were given special attention. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) "TamilNet," the pro-LTTE website, provided </p><p>several stories on the Oslo meeting.  Most of its </p><p>reporting, predictably, focused on Balasingham\'s </p><p>remarks.  Reflecting a newfound commitment to balanced </p><p>reporting, however, TamilNet also provided a thorough </p><p>review of Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s remarks, including </p><p>his call for the LTTE to renounce, terrorism, violence, </p><p>and separatism. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SPECIAL PRAISE FOR U.S. REMARKS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In discussions with a wide variety of contacts, </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s remarks drew special praise. </p><p>Most of the comments focused on that section of the </p><p>remarks that referred to the LTTE.  Reaction included: </p><p>-- Kethesh Loganathan, an analyst at the Center of </p><p>Policy Alternatives, a local think-tank, told us that </p><p>the U.S. presence at the meeting was constructive in </p><p>underscoring international support for the peace </p><p>process.  In addition, the Deputy Secretary\'s remarks </p><p>had set "clear-cut boundaries" (renounce terrorism and </p><p>violence, etc.) that the LTTE needed to absorb fully if </p><p>the group wanted increased international acceptance. </p><p> </p><p>-- Taranjit Sandhu, the polcouns at the Indian High </p><p>Commission, also praised the Deputy Secretary\'s remarks. </p><p>He stressed that the comments re the LTTE should prove </p><p>beneficial in convincing the group that it needed to do </p><p>more to convince the international community that it had </p><p>transformed itself.  Sandhu went on to express some </p><p>concern that the LTTE might get the wrong message from </p><p>the meeting and believe that the fact that it was </p><p>allowed to be present at all signified international </p><p>acceptance. </p><p> </p><p>-- Harim Peiris, a spokesman for President Kumaratunga, </p><p>told us that he thought that the Deputy Secretary\'s </p><p>remarks were positive and should prove "bracing" for the </p><p>LTTE.  It was important that the group not believe that </p><p>it had already earned international acceptance. </p><p> </p><p>-- Joseph Pararajahsingham, a senior Tamil National </p><p>Alliance MP, welcomed U.S. participation at the Oslo </p><p>meeting.  While not commenting directly on the Deputy </p><p>Secretary\'s remarks re the LTTE, Pararajahsingham was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>not critical of those remarks either.  He said he </p><p>thought Oslo was a great success for the peace process. </p><p>(Note:  Pararajahsingham is extremely pro-LTTE.  He said </p><p>he had just gotten back to Colombo from a LTTE "Heroes\'s </p><p>Day" celebration in his hometown of Batticaloa.) </p><p>(Note:  TamilNet cited Balasingham as welcoming U.S. </p><p>participation in the Oslo meeting by stating:  "The </p><p>American participation in this meeting is an </p><p>extraordinarily important matter for us because it </p><p>reinforces the point that the LTTE is a crucial partner </p><p>in resolving the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka.") </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>OPPOSITION PLANS RALLY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) President Kumaratunga, who has long been at odds </p><p>with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, has not yet come out </p><p>with a public statement in reaction to the Oslo meeting. </p><p>Her assistant, Harim Peiris, said he would hold a press </p><p>conference tomorrow to review the president\'s stance. </p><p>Peiris seemed to indicate that the president would not </p><p>be taking a negative position, but that her reaction </p><p>would be positive-themed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In the meantime, members of Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party are planning a rally in </p><p>Colombo today (November 26) protesting the GSL\'s </p><p>handling of the peace process.  Several senior PA MPs </p><p>reportedly plan to participate in the rally, including </p><p>Anura Bandaranaike (the president\'s brother), Mangala </p><p>Samaraweera, and Dinesh Gunarwardena.  MPs from the </p><p>radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will also </p><p>participate.  (Note:  Judging from previous anti-peace </p><p>process rallies, most of the crowd will consist of JVP </p><p>supporters.)  Queried about the rally, Peiris separated </p><p>the president\'s office from it, asserting that the rally </p><p>did not involve President Kumaratunga. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) It is still early, but our preliminary </p><p>assessment is that the Oslo meeting provided the peace </p><p>process a solid boost.  Per expectations (see Reftels), </p><p>most of the focus at the meeting reportedly was on the </p><p>message that the international community supports the </p><p>peace process -- and not on pledging by donors.  That </p><p>political message was well received and was amplified </p><p>significantly by U.S. participation.  In addition, based </p><p>on the press coverage, our message re the LTTE was also </p><p>broadcast loud-and-clear.  Whether the LTTE picked up on </p><p>our message -- aside from Balasingham\'s publicized </p><p>comments to the effect that the LTTE could not totally </p><p>forswear violence at this time -- will be tested in the </p><p>first instance on November 27 by the substance of </p><p>Prabhakaran\'s annual address (see Reftel).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
