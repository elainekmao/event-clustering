<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000328 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND AF/W </p><p>ALSO FOR INL/E. FLOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: MASS, SNAR, KCRM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARTICLE 98 DEMARCHE ON NIGERIA\'S </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Ambassador and Regional Narcotics and Law </p><p>Enforcement Officer (RNLEO) met with Attorney </p><p>General Kanu Agabi on 31 January 2003.  In </p><p>addition to formally introducing the new RNLEO to </p><p>the Attorney General, the Ambassador delivered a </p><p>letter on Article 98 Agreements.  The AG said he </p><p>would pass it on to the Solicitor General.  In </p><p>addition, he stated that the GON was looking at </p><p>this issue and would get back to us.  The </p><p>Ambassador explained the American Service </p><p>Protection Act and the impact it would have on our </p><p>robust security assistance relationship as well as </p><p>the implications of Article 98 Agreements for </p><p>Nigeria considering its role in peacekeeping. </p><p>Agabi stated that he would acquaint the President </p><p>with the matter so that when the Ambassador </p><p>discussed the issue, the President would know </p><p>about it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On the issue of the Daniel Ohriunu extradition </p><p>case before the court, the AG stated that everything </p><p>was being done to expedite the case, to hear appeals </p><p>quickly and to punish judges that were found to be </p><p>corrupt.  He further stated that he wanted to be in </p><p>court himself but couldn\'t.  He directed his assistant </p><p>to put the matter on his calendar so that as soon as </p><p>he returned from his trip to New York, he would "take </p><p>over the matter himself." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The AG also stated that the Chief Judge of the Federal </p><p>High Court had assured him that she would appoint a </p><p>Judge to be in charge of hearing all extradition </p><p>cases.  The next hearing on the Ohriunu case is </p><p>scheduled for 18 and 19 February.  The AG hoped his </p><p>personal intervention would help accelerate the case </p><p>and get a judgment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The AG, in his usual frank manner, commented that </p><p>it would be hard to enforce fair elections.  He </p><p>pointed to the primaries stating that he wanted to </p><p>lower expectations that the elections would be "free </p><p>and fair" and meet the standards expected of a mature </p><p>democracy.  "You must bear with us", he said, "Nigeria </p><p>still has a long way to go." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
