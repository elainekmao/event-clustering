(SBU) SUMMARY: NORTHERN LEAGUE LEADER (AND MINISTER FOR </p><p>REFORM AND DEVOLUTION) BOSSI MET WITH THE AMBASSADOR JULY 17 </p><p>FOR A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION OF ISSUES, INCLUDING DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICS, DEVOLUTION, IMMIGRATION AND THE FUTURE OF THE EU. </p><p>RELAXED AND STRAIGHTFORWARD, BOSSI EXPLAINED NEXT STEPS IN </p><p>THE DEVOLUTION PROCESS, THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE BOSSI-FINI </p><p>IMMIGRATION LAW, AND HIS ECONOMIC CONCERNS REGARDING EU </p><p>ENLARGEMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR MET JULY 17 WITH UMBERTO BOSSI, LEADER </p><p>OF THE LEGA NORD (LN), A LEADER OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>COALITION AND MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO FOR REFORM AND </p><p>DEVOLUTION.  A/DCM AND ECON COUNSELOR WERE ALSO PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>ITALIAN POLITICS AND ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BOSSI EXPECTS THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT TO SERVE ITS </p><p>FULL FIVE-YEAR TERM.  IN HIS VIEW, THE REALIGNMENT OF SEVERAL </p><p>FORMER CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTIES INTO THE NEW "CHRISTIAN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CENTER" WAS NOT A REAL THREAT.  WHILE THIS GROUP </p><p>(WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE GOVERNING COALITION) WAS INTERESTED </p><p>IN RETURNING TO POLITICAL POWER, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>STRENGTH TO STRIKE OUT ON THEIR OWN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BOSSI RECALLED THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAD INHERITED A </p><p>COUNTRY WITH AN UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH FISCAL DEFICIT, 37 BILLION </p><p>LIRE (USD 18 MILLION) OVER THE ANTICIPATED LEVEL, WHICH </p><p>SOMEWHAT SLOWED THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO MAKE </p><p>NECESSARY CHANGES.  HOWEVER, MINISTER TREMONTI WAS A CREATIVE </p><p>MAN, AND HAD MOVED AHEAD WITH REFORMS NONETHELESS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03639  01 OF 03  231626Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE LABOR SITUATION, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE GOI HAD COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THREE OF </p><p>THE FOUR MAJOR LABOR UNIONS.  WHAT WERE PROSPECTS FOR AN </p><p>ACCORD WITH THE CGIL?  BOSSI RESPONDED THAT HE SAW LITTLE </p><p>PROSPECT OF AN ACCORD UNTIL CGIL LEADER COFFERATI RETIRED IN </p><p>LATE SUMMER.  COFFERATI\'S SUCCESSOR SEEMED A MORE MODERATE </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR, AND WAS MORE LIKELY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BOSSI EXPLAINED THAT MOST ITALIAN UNIONS HAVE FEW </p><p>WORKERS AND MANY RETIREES.  ONLY ONE NORTHERN UNION CONSISTS </p><p>OF ONLY WORKERS.  UNIONS, HE DECLARED, WERE INTERESTED IN </p><p>PROTECTING PENSIONS, NOT CREATING JOBS.   TWENTY TO THIRTY </p><p>YEARS AGO, THE GOI HAD GIVEN UNIONS THE SOLE CONTRACT FOR </p><p>HANDLING PAPERWORK FOR WORKER AND PENSION BENEFITS. EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE GOI HAD SPENT $2 BILLION RESTRUCTURING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S INPS SOCIAL BENEFITS SYSTEM, ONLY UNIONS COULD </p><p>PROCESS THIS PAPERWORK -- FOR A FEE PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>FOR EACH DOCUMENT.  THE UNIONS EARN AT LEAST $750 MILLION </p><p>ANNUALLY FOR THIS SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) "AS A RESULT, UNIONS ARE RICHER THAN POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES IN ITALY," BOSSI EXPLAINED.  "TAKE COFFERATI AND </p><p>(CENTER-LEFT DS LEADER) FASSINO FOR EXAMPLE.  THE CGIL\'S </p><p>COFFERATI HAS MONEY TO PAY FOR BUSES TO TRANSPORT UNION </p><p>MEMBERS FOR MASS DEMONSTRATIONS.  THE DS\'S FASSINO DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE MONEY FOR THIS."   FURTHERMORE, BOSSI CONTINUED, THE </p><p>UNIONS WANT TO SET UP AND RUN PENSION FUNDS.  BY DOING SO, </p><p>THE UNIONS WOULD BECOME FINANCIERS AND MANAGERS OF PENSION </p><p>FUNDS -- EVEN STRONGER FINANCIALLY AND POLITICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03639  01 OF 03  231626Z </p><p>8. (C) COFFERATI WILL ENTER POLITICS AT THE END OF THE </p><p>SUMMER, WHEN HE RETIRES FROM THE CGIL, EXPLAINED BOSSI. </p><p>BOSSI EXPECTED COFFERATI TO RECONSTITUTE THE COMMUNIST POLE </p><p>IN ITALY, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE REFOUNDED COMMUNISTS (RC). </p><p>(COMMENT:  MAYBE.  WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT HE WOULD </p><p>ATTRACT THOSE ON ITALY\'S LEFT, BUT WE THINK HE WOULD RATHER </p><p>BE AN ALLY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT (DS) THAN WITH THE RC. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>DEVOLUTION AND FEDERALISM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) BOSSI DETAILED THE DEVOLUTION PROCESS IN ITALY.  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE PROCESS HAD BEGUN UNDER THE (1998-2000 </p><p>CENTER-LEFT) D\'ALEMA GOVERNMENT, WHICH TOOK THE FIRST STEP BY </p><p>MODIFYING TITLE V OF THE CONSTITUTION (THE PART OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN CONSTITUTION THAT SETS OUT CENTRAL AND REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES). "IT WAS DONE TO KEEP US (THE </p><p>LEGA) FROM JOINING BERLUSCONI," HE EXPLAINED.  (NOTE: BOTH </p><p>ITALY\'S CENTER-LEFT AND CENTER-RIGHT HAVE, IN THE PAST, </p><p>SOUGHT TO GAIN THE LEGA\'S ALLEGIANCE.  BOSSI SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>THE TITLE V REFORM WAS A LAST-DITCH EFFORT BY THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>TO WOO HIS PARTY.  END NOTE.) THIS GAVE REGIONS SOMEWHAT MORE </p><p>CONTROL OVER SCHOOLS, HEALTH CARE AND LOCAL POLICE (VIGILI </p><p>URBANI), ALBEIT WITH CONSIDERABLE ONGOING CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>OVERSIGHT  IT WAS ONLY A SMALL STEP TOWARD DEVOLUTION, </p><p>HOWEVER.   THE NEXT STEP -- IN 2003 -- WILL BE TO CHANGE THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4581 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03639  02 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CA-01    CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OCS-03   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  VO-03    PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /018W </p><p>                  ------------------CF2A6B  231627Z /38 </p><p>P 231625Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5040 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 003639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EUN, PINR, ELAB, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BOSSI ON ITALIAN POLITICS, DEVOLUTION, IMMIGRATION </p><p>AND THE EU </p><p> </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COURT BY ADDING REGIONAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO THOSE FROM THE PARLIAMENT, PRESIDENT AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03639  02 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>JUDICIARY.  THE THIRD STEP WILL BE TO TURN THE ITALIAN SENATE </p><p>INTO A FEDERALIST BODY.  "THIS WILL BE A HISTORIC STEP IN THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF A PRESIDENTIAL REPUBLIC. WE WILL DO IT IN OUR </p><p>LAST YEAR (2006), AS IT WILL REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ELECTIONS," HE </p><p>ADDED.  THE CHAMBER WILL HANDLE ONLY THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>WILL HANDLE REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE SENATE WILL </p><p>HANDLE AREAS OF JOINT OR OVERLAPPING COMPETENCY.  THE RESULT </p><p>WILL RESEMBLE THE FRENCH FEDERAL SYSTEM MORE THAN THE U.S. </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM.  "ITALY IS NOT MATURE ENOUGH FOR U.S.-STYLE, </p><p>STRONG FEDERALISM," BOSSI EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BOSSI CHARACTERIZED PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AS </p><p>"PRESIDENTIAL - ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>SYSTEM."  BERLUSCONI IS A DECISIVE DECISION-MAKER AND </p><p>MANAGER, NOT A MAN OF COMPROMISE.  HE WAS VOTED INTO POWER AS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT LEADER.  "THE BALLOT HAD BERLUSCONI\'S PICTURE </p><p>AND THE PARTY SYMBOL."  IN ITALY, STRESSED BOSSI, THE IDEAS </p><p>OF PRESIDENT AND FEDERALISM ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC MIND. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR AND BOSSI THEN COMPARED THE PROBLEMS </p><p>OF ITALY\'S SOUTH TO THOSE OF THE U.S. SOUTH MANY YEARS AGO -- </p><p>ALSO AN AREA CHARACTERIZED BY AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND </p><p>HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED HOW SOUTHERN </p><p>LEADERS IN THE U.S. HAD OBTAINED INVESTMENT FUNDS AND </p><p>PERSUADED MANUFACTURING FIRMS TO SET UP IN THE SOUTH.  BOSSI </p><p>CONTRASTED THIS TO SOUTHERN ITALY\'S EXPERIENCE.  "WE IN ITALY </p><p>BORROWED A LOT FROM KEYNES, WHO INSPIRED OUR CASSA PER IL </p><p>MEZZOGIORNO (FUND FOR SOUTHERN ITALY).  BUT HERE THE IDEA WAS </p><p>CHANGED FROM ONE OF CREATING BUSINESS TO A WELFARE STATE."  A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03639  02 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>U.S. STATE CAN MAKE LAWS AND UNDERTAKE PROGRAMS, AND IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE TO ITS CITIZENS FOR THE RESULTS.  IN ITALY, </p><p>INSTEAD, HE EXPLAINED, "THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT MAKES THE LAWS </p><p>AND PROVIDES THE MONEY, WHILE LOCAL POLITICIANS ARE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTHING.  ITALY SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF </p><p>INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY.  ITALY HAD THE LARGEST COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY IN THE WORLD, AND THE STATE PROVIDED MONEY FOR </p><p>EVERYTHING."  BOSSI DECLARED THAT BUSINESS NEEDED "A STABLE </p><p>CURRENCY AND GOOD ROADS -- NOT WELFARE HANDOUTS."  THE </p><p>ITALIAN SOUTH NEEDS REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS WITH REAL POWER AND </p><p>RESPONSIBLE TO CITIZENS FOR THE RESULTS.  "THE PROBLEMS OF </p><p>THE SOUTH OF ITALY WILL NEVER BE RESOLVED UNTIL THE CITIZENS </p><p>AND POLITICIANS OF THE SOUTH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>FATES," HE ARGUED. </p><p> </p><p>IMMIGRATION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE A/DCM ASKED ABOUT THE FINI-BOSSI IMMIGRATION LAW. </p><p> BOSSI REPLIED THAT HE HAD DRAFTED THE LAW EXACTLY ONE YEAR </p><p>AGO. HIS BASIC CONCERN IN DOING SO, HE EXPLAINED, WAS </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY, A FEAR OF GROWING UNREST AMONG BOTH </p><p>ITALIAN YOUTH AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  BOSSI FEARED THAT </p><p>ITALY WOULD BE AT RISK IF ITS YOUNG PEOPLE COULD NOT OBTAIN </p><p>PERMANENT JOBS, BUT ONLY TEMPORARY, FIXED-TERM CONTRACTS.  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED: "IF YOU HAVE THREE APPLICANTS FOR EACH JOB, THEN </p><p>OK, THAT IS COMPETITION.  BUT IF YOU HAVE 100 APPLICANTS FOR </p><p>EACH JOB, THEN YOU LEAVE ITALIANS -- PARTICULARLY YOUNG </p><p>PEOPLE -- WITHOUT HOPE.  THIS IS AN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS </p><p>SITUATION."  AT THE SAME TIME, HE ARGUED, ITALY FACES AN </p><p>INFLUX OF JOBLESS, HOMELESS IMMIGRANTS, WHO CAN EASILY FALL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03639  02 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>INTO A CRIMINAL LIFESTYLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) MANY HAD SUGGESTED THAT THE PROBLEM OF RISING </p><p>IMMIGRATION COULD BEST BE RESOLVED THROUGH AID TO THE THIRD </p><p>WORLD.  BOSSI DISAGREED.  HE NOTED THAT HE STRONGLY OPPOSED </p><p>THE TOBIN TAX (NOTE: THIS IS A PROPOSED TAX ON CROSS-BORDER </p><p>CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INTENDED TO CUT DOWN ON CURRENCY </p><p>SPECULATION AND PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS. END NOTE). </p><p>MOREOVER, HE WAS CONVINCED THAT MOST ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN </p><p>THE THIRD WORLD USE 80 PERCENT OF THEIR FUNDING FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>IN-HOUSE EXPENSES, DOING LITTLE TO FIGHT THIRD WORLD POVERTY. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) BOSSI PREFERRED TO LINK SUPPLY AND DEMAND.  THE LAW </p><p>CONDITIONS ENTRY OF IMMIGRANTS ON EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS.  IN </p><p>THIS WAY, ONLY IMMIGRANTS WITH THE MEANS TO SUPPORT </p><p>THEMSELVES LEGALLY WILL ENTER ITALY.  THIS SHOULD, HE HOPED, </p><p>IMPROVE JOB PROSPECTS FOR ITALIANS.  THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN </p><p>ANTI-FOREIGN OR RACIST PROVISION.  RATHER, IT WAS INTENDED TO </p><p>SLOW THE ENTRY OF IMMIGRANTS TO A PACE THAT ITALY COULD </p><p>ABSORB. "WE KNOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING.  WE CAN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>CONTROL ONLY THE SPEED OF THAT CHANGE."  IT WAS IN NO ONE\'S </p><p>INTEREST TO SEE RELIGIOUS CONFLICT, A CLASH OF CULTURES, </p><p>EXPLAINED BOSSI. </p><p> </p><p>EU ENLARGEMENT AND THE CONVENTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4582 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03639  03 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CA-01    CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  VO-03 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /017W </p><p>                  ------------------CF2A7F  231627Z /38 </p><p>P 231625Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5041 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 003639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EUN, PINR, ELAB, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BOSSI ON ITALIAN POLITICS, DEVOLUTION, IMMIGRATION </p><p>AND THE EU </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) BOSSI WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EU BECOME A "LOOSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03639  03 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>CONFEDERATION."  HE IS CONVINCED THAT "THE LEFT PLANS TO USE </p><p>THE CONVENTION TO CREATE A SUPERSTATE, A UNITED STATES OF </p><p>EUROPE, BUT I DON\'T BELIEVE THEY WILL ACHIEVE THIS."   THE </p><p>PROCESS OF ENLARGEMENT, ADDING COUNTRIES, WILL PREVENT TIGHT </p><p>CENTRAL CONTROL AND LOWER THE RISK FOR CONFLICT WITH THE U.S. </p><p>THAT COULD RESULT FROM A MORE POWERFUL, CENTRALLY-GOVERNED EU. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) ENLARGEMENT, EXPLAINED BOSSI, WILL CAUSE ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS FOR EXISTING MEMBERS AND NEW ENTRANTS.  THE EU </p><p>STRUCTURAL FUNDS HAVE POURED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE </p><p>ITALIAN SOUTH, BOSSI NOTED, AND THIS WOULD END WITH EU </p><p>ENLARGEMENT.  FEDERALISM WOULD BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT -- IT </p><p>WAS ESSENTIAL TO MOVE DECISION-MAKING AND RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>CLOSER TO CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE INITIAL IDEA OF MANY IN THE EU, HE SAID, WAS THAT </p><p>NEW MEMBERS WOULD PROVIDE LARGE NEW MARKETS.  IN BOSSI\'S </p><p>VIEW, HOWEVER, MAASTRICHT TARGETS WILL PROVE DIFFICULT AND </p><p>EXPENSIVE TO MEET FOR THESE NEW ENTRANTS.  "HOW WILL A </p><p>COUNTRY SUCH AS POLAND LOWER ITS FISCAL DEFICIT TO THREE </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP, LOWER ITS DEBT?" HE ASKED.  NECESSARY </p><p>ECONOMIC MEASURES TO MEET THESE TARGETS MAY BE SO DIFFICULT </p><p>AND COSTLY THAT SOME CANDIDATES MAY CONSIDER EU MEMBERSHIP </p><p>TOO EXPENSIVE.  BOSSI WAS IN FAVOR OF REVISING THE STABILITY </p><p>PACT TARGETS.  HE STRESSED "YOU CAN,T COMPETE WITH YOUR </p><p>HANDS TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK.  THESE NEW COUNTRIES ARE FACING </p><p>THAT PROBLEM.  MINISTER TREMONTI UNDERSTANDS THIS ENTIRE </p><p>ISSUE VERY WELL." </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER THE CONVENTION WOULD </p><p>CHANGE EU DECISIONMAKING. BOSSI THOUGHT NOT.  "THE CURRENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03639  03 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>SYSTEM GIVES EVEN SMALL COUNTRIES THE RIGHT TO VETO MEASURES </p><p>AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS.  THIS VETO PREVENTS THE CREATION OF </p><p>THE EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE THAT THE LEFT WANTS."  NOTING THAT </p><p>THE TRADITION OF NATION STATES IS VERY STRONG IN EUROPE, </p><p>BOSSI SUGGESTED THAT MEMBER STATES NEEDED TO RETAIN A VETO IN </p><p>EU DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BOSSI\'S VIEW OF PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) BOSSI SEVERAL TIMES EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR THE U.S. </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM AND, IN PARTICULAR, FOR PRESIDENT BUSH.  HE </p><p>RECOUNTED THAT, IN 1999, THE GOVERNMENT HAD SENT HIM TO </p><p>BELGRADE TO TALK TO MILOSOVIC, TO PERSUADE HIM TO NEGOTIATE. </p><p> "MILOSOVIC WAS A VERY SMART MAN, BUT HE DIDN\'T RECOGNIZE </p><p>THAT THE WORLD HAD CHANGED.  HE NEVER ACCEPTED THE WESTPHALIA </p><p>TREATY.  HE BELIEVED THAT EVERY KING HAD AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO </p><p>RULE HIS COUNTRY AS HE WISHED.  I WENT, KNOWING THAT I\'D LOSE </p><p>VOTES IF I FAILED.  I KNEW I WAS BEING SET UP TO FAIL.  I </p><p>HOPED, HOWEVER, TO BRING OUT AT LEAST ONE OF THE THREE </p><p>AMERICAN SERVICEMEN THAT MILOSOVIC WAS HOLDING.  I FIGURED I </p><p>COULD GET AT LEAST ONE.  THE IDEA WAS THAT I\'D BRING HIM TO </p><p>ITALY, AND GOV. BUSH WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE U.S. FROM THERE. </p><p>BUT MILOSOVIC DID NOT MAKE A DEAL.  AND HE GAVE THE AMERICANS </p><p>TO JESSE JACKSON."  BOSSI, BASED ON HIS CONTACT WITH FUTURE </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH, BEGAN TO STUDY HIM. "I FOUND MYSELF ATTRACTED </p><p>BY A MAN WHO EATS MEXICAN BEANS INSTEAD OF CHINESE FRIED RICE </p><p>LIKE CLINTON.  I ADMIRE HIS WIFE\'S DEDICATION TO WORKING ON </p><p>IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUES." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03639  03 OF 03  231627Z </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) BOSSI\'S STATEMENTS ABOUT MOVING TO A PRESIDENTIAL, </p><p>FEDERALIST SYSTEM WERE TIMELY.  IN RECENT DAYS, WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>DIVERSE OPINIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL.  BOSSI CLEARLY FAVORED </p><p>A STRONG PRESIDENTIAL FIGURE, BALANCED BY EQUALLY STONG </p><p>REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  HE PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON </p><p>HIS RECENTLY-ENACTED IMMIGRATION BILL.  THIS LEGISLATION, </p><p>WHICH TIGHTENED IMMIGRATION RULES, WAS SUPPORTED BY MANY WHO </p><p>RESENT FOREIGN COMPETITION FOR ITALIAN JOBS AND INFLUENCE ON </p><p>ITALIAN CULTURE AND VALUES. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) BOSSI WAS RELAXED AND STRAIGHTFORWARD DURING HIS </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HE CAME ACROSS AS A </p><p>PRAGMATIC BUT COMMITTED CONSERVATIVE LEADER IN A COUNTRY </p><p>STILL LARGELY TO HIS LEFT.  HIS COMMENTS ON PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI, WHOM HE CLEARLY RESPECTS, INDICATED THAT BOSSI </p><p>ACCEPTS HIS SECONDARY POSITION IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND </p><p>BELIEVES HIS CONTRIBUTION IS VALUED.  HE REALIZES THAT HIS </p><p>FOUR PERCENT OF THE VOTE DOES NOT MAKE HIM EQUAL PARTNERS IN </p><p>THE COALITION, AND THAT HE CANNOT PUSH BERLUSCONI TOO FAR. </p><p>BOSSI SEEMS COMFORTABLE IN HIS CURRENT ROLE, AND MORE MATURE </p><p>AND REASONABLE THAN HIS OUTSPOKEN PUBLIC IMAGE WOULD SUGGEST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03639 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
