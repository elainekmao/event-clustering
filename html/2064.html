<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002617 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/OP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/PSP/FPD </p><p>LAGOS FOR RSO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/11 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS3: PETROL BOMB AT KANO BRITISH COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2508 B. ABUJA 2478 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter: Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On 15 October 2001, Embassy Abuja received information </p><p>from a reliable source that the British Council in Kano had </p><p>been the target of a petrol bomb during the early morning </p><p>hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) RSO met British High Commission Security Officer, </p><p>Keith Rowland, who offered the following details: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Despite a GON imposed dusk to dawn curfew, approximately a </p><p>few minutes after midnight an unspecified number of petrol </p><p>bombs were thrown over the rear perimeter wall of the British </p><p>Council in Kano; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The petrol bombs landed in an open area of the Council\'s </p><p>grounds and were quickly extinguished by local guard force </p><p>personnel; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There were no injuries or damage to property; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The British Council has increased its security posture in </p><p>Kano, and local police are investigating the attack; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- At this time, there have been no claims of responsibility </p><p>or arrests by the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) This is the first and only incident in Nigeria </p><p>targeting an allied forces Mission of which we are aware. We </p><p>have no reason to view it as other than an isolated incident. </p><p>Our British colleagues do not view this incident as a </p><p>precursor to more serious threats. Embassy Abuja had </p><p>previously identified Kano as a potential hotspot (Ref B). </p><p>The USG does not have any direct-hire personnel located in </p><p>Kano, and the attack does not trigger further action based on </p><p>established trip wires (Ref A). American citizens in Kano </p><p>report that they are alert and practicing situational </p><p>awareness while going about their business. Kano is located </p><p>in northern Nigeria and is a five hour drive from Abuja and </p><p>thirteen hours from Lagos. The nearest Operation Focus Relief </p><p>(OFR) forces are in Birnin-Kebbi, about six hours away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) RSO and Post management agree that the situation </p><p>bears close monitoring. An EAC meeting will soon be convened </p><p>to discuss the attack\'s implications on Abuja, if any. The </p><p>security posture at all USG installations in Abuja remains at </p><p>the highest levels. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
