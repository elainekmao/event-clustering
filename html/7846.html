Some payments arrears and </p><p>deviations between actual expenditures and amounts budgeted. </p><p> </p><p>The fiscal data published shows little if any expenditure </p><p>spending. </p><p> </p><p>E. List up to 5 key laws and/or regulations governing public </p><p>disclosure of revenues and expenditures in the national budget, </p><p>if applicable and such laws exist. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras commenced the implementation of the Integrated Financial </p><p>Management System (SIAFI).  The SIAFI will work to improve </p><p>governmental accountability through improvements in the execution </p><p>and control of expenditures.  The system will be comprised of </p><p>four main subsystems: budget, treasury, accounting and public </p><p>credit.  At full implementation the system will include 15 </p><p>ministries, 20 dependencies of the ministries, and 36 </p><p>decentralized entities, as well as 298 municipalities.  At </p><p>present, eight ministries are connected to the SIAFI via </p><p>electronic data transmission, covering about 85 percent of the </p><p>central government budgetary transactions.  Implementation of the </p><p>SIAFI has not yet begun at the municipal level. </p><p> </p><p>The National Statistics Institute of (INE) was recently </p><p>established, through Legislative Decree No. 86/2000 and will </p><p>report fiscal statistics for the budgets collection of Government </p><p>Finance Statistics (GFS). </p><p> </p><p>According to the 2002 Legislative Decree No. 10/2002 establishing </p><p>a national auditing body (the Tribunal of Accounts), the Tribunal </p><p>must present reports to Congress. </p><p> </p><p>F.

Does a national audit body or equivalent organization, </p><p>independent of the executive, provide reports for the legislature </p><p>and the public on the financial integrity of government accounts? </p><p> </p><p>Yes, but the reports are not published. </p><p> </p><p>J. How would the link between nonfinancial public/state-owned </p><p>(e.g. extractive industries) enterprises and general government </p><p>be described? </p><p> </p><p>Level 3 - Clear control under central government budget process </p><p>The government has clear control over state-owned enterprises </p><p>(the largest ones include the port authority, the electric power </p><p>company, and the telephone company).  In the past the central </p><p>government has used the revenues of state-owned enterprises to </p><p>finance other governmental offices and projects. </p><p> </p><p>K. Are privatization processes transparent and published? </p><p>Level 2 - Moderately transparent </p><p> </p><p>The bidding documents are published, and tenders are opened </p><p>publicly, but the decision process is not totally transparent. </p><p> </p><p>L. How would the reliability of budget revenue and expenditure </p><p>estimates best be described? </p><p> </p><p>Level 2 - Moderately reliable </p><p> </p><p>M. Please provide a short evaluative narrative of host government </p><p>commitment to fiscal transparency and accountability. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras has taken several steps in recent years to improve </p><p>fiscal transparency and accountability.  The GOH has improved its </p><p>budget documentation by offering more complete information on the </p><p>governments fiscal activity.   The gradual implementation of the </p><p>SIAFI can be accredited for improving the quality and consistency </p><p>of budget documentation.  The presentation and publishing of the </p><p>central government\'s budget including revenues and expenditures </p><p>has significantly improved.  Quarterly and monthly reports by the </p><p>Ministry of Finance to Congress report the central government\'s </p><p>fiscal position and budget execution.  The GOH has also improved </p><p>the quality of internal consistency of fiscal data. </p><p> </p><p>However, there are many areas in which the GOH is deficient, such </p><p>as implementing measures designed to create better fiscal </p><p>transparency and accountability.  Although the gradual </p><p>implementation of the SIAFI has lead to improvements, the slow </p><p>pace of implementation has prevented other changes.  These </p><p>changes include enhanced budget formulation, control procedures, </p><p>and improvements in the quality and timely budget execution </p><p>reports and final accounts.  The reliability of budget data has </p><p>increased in recent years, but deviations between approved and </p><p>executed budgets are still significant.  Budget documents and </p><p>final accounts do not include a statement of the accounting </p><p>policies and standards used. </p><p> </p><p>N. Please list U.S. government-sponsored programs and activities </p><p>that promote accurate disclosure of revenues and expenditures in </p><p>the national budgets of your host country.  Please also summarize </p><p>the results of those programs and activities. </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to facilitate greater transparency in the </p><p>development and implementation of the GOH\'s budget, and with </p><p>the conviction that civil society has the responsibility to act </p><p>as an independent agent, overseeing the appropriate use of public </p><p>funds, USAID/Honduras under its Hurricane Mitch funded a </p><p>Transparency and Anti-Corruption Activity, working in conjunction </p><p>with a local NGO (the Center for the Investigation and Promotion </p><p>of Human Rights) to sponsor workshops on the GOH\'s general </p><p>budget.  The objective of these events is threefold: a) increase </p><p>civil society\'s understanding of current budget legislation and </p><p>its shortfalls; b) formulate solutions to solve the lack of </p><p>transparency in the budget formulation, approval, execution and </p><p>control systems, and c) increase civil society\'s participation </p><p>and understanding of the Honduran national budget process. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusions and recommendations resulting from these workshops </p><p>were developed by a group of civil society organizations and </p><p>presented to the Transparency and Good Governance Group </p><p>(mechanism of dialogue which includes the government, civil </p><p>society and international donors) for inclusion in the table of </p><p>indicators.  Events also received extensive press coverage.  In </p><p>addition, these events helped place the national budget\'s process </p><p>and its transparency high on the agenda of civil society and </p><p>political leaders (e.g. articles were published in local </p><p>newspapers on the need for fiscal transparency). </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
