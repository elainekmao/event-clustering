<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000366 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "World must block Bush, Blair\'s </p><p>      belligerence" the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>      News" carried an op-ed by Tajudeen Abdul-Raheem </p><p>      in which he calls on Arab governments to restrain </p><p>      the United States and Britain from attacking </p><p>      Iraq.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "There is a kind of fatigue about the imminent </p><p>      Anglo-American attack on Iraq that is the result </p><p>      of media saturation and helplessness.  The talk </p><p>      of war, preparations for it and declarations </p><p>      about it have become so much a part of our daily </p><p>      diet for almost a year now that even though the </p><p>      majority of the peoples of the world. . .are </p><p>      opposed to the war.  They are so tired of being </p><p>      bombarded by its imminence that many no longer </p><p>      care to read or watch anything to do with the war </p><p>      or simply switch off mentally when they hear </p><p>      `Iraq.\'  Consequently, there seems to be a </p><p>      general feeling of `let them get it over with.\' </p><p>      Many people are convinced that there is nothing </p><p>      much that can be done to stop George W. Bush and </p><p>      Tony Blair from attacking Iraq.  They are </p><p>      committed to the United Nations track for as long </p><p>      as it grants them the license to destroy Iraq as </p><p>      they are so bent on doing.  So the U.N. </p><p>      inspectors, according to London and Washington, </p><p>      have only one function: to get them the evidence </p><p>      they need to finish off Saddam. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .However, amidst all the deceit, frustration </p><p>      and deployment of weapons of mass deception by </p><p>      the Americans and the British, there is an oasis </p><p>      of hope that against all the odds some countries, </p><p>      institutions, peoples and individuals are not </p><p>      being cowed into submission. . .  Why can\'t Bush </p><p>      and Blair be honest enough to say: `We don\'t </p><p>      know.\'  They do not have any evidence that will </p><p>      convince any thinking person but they turn around </p><p>      to accuse doubters of timidity, treachery or </p><p>      giving succor to Saddam Hussein.  The choice is </p><p>      not and cannot be between Bush and Saddam.  If </p><p>      that be the case it would be limiting human </p><p>      possibilities to their least common factor. . . </p><p>      Whatever is being done in Europe, America and </p><p>      other parts of the world to stop this unjust war </p><p>      will not be successful if the Arab governments, </p><p>      out of their own greed and desperation to hold on </p><p>      to power continue to short-change their people. </p><p>      They voice unease and even opposition to the war </p><p>      while behind closed doors they are giving </p><p>      military and strategic concessions to the </p><p>      Americans.  Where are the peace campaigners in </p><p>      Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Morocco, </p><p>      Oman, Jordan, Qatar and other Gulf Stations </p><p>      (those are not countries but gas stations!)?" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
