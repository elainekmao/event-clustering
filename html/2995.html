<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JAKARTA 001853 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, EAP/PIMBS; </p><p>OSD FOR USDP/ISA/AP SCHER; </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>NAIROBI FOR MARK CLARK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ID, US </p><p>SUBJECT: RELIGOUS EXTREMISTS SEEKING "SHORTCUT TO </p><p>PARADISE," COORDINATING MINISTER KALLA TELLS A/S KELLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF I. REED, REASON 1. 5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  COORDINATING PEOPLE\'S WELFARE MINISTER JUSUF </p><p>KALLA TOLD VISITING EAP A/S JAMES KELLY MAY 18 THAT ECONOMIC </p><p>MARGINALIZATION OF LOCALS WAS THE ROOT CAUSE OF INDONESIA\'S </p><p>COMMUNAL AND SEPARATIST CONFLICTS.  HE DOWNPLAYED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AND OTHER POWERFUL VESTED </p><p>INTERESTS, CHARACTERIZING THEM MORE AS A SYMPTOM THAN A </p><p>CAUSE. THE GOI\'S APPROACH TO SOLVING THE CONFLICTS, KALLA </p><p>SAID, WOULD BE TO REDUCE POVERTY AND IMPROVE HEALTH, </p><p>EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, WHILE LEAVING </p><p>"THE REST" TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  IN A LAND WHERE FEAR OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AND UNSEEN MALEVOLENT FORCES OFTEN </p><p>STYMIES ACTION, KALLA\'S EMPHASIS ON ECONOMICS AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>SERVICES WAS REFRESHING, AND MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY HIS </p><p>POLITICAL STAR IS RISING.  AS USUAL, THE HARD PART WILL BE </p><p>FOLLOW-THROUGH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COORDINATING MINISTER FOR PEOPLE\'S WELFARE JUSUF KALLA </p><p>DISCUSSED INDONESIA\'S SEPARATIST AND COMMUNAL CONFLICTS AND </p><p>OTHER ISSUES UNDER HIS SUPERVISION IN A MAY 18 MEETING WITH </p><p>VISITING EAP ASSISTANT SECRETARY JAMES KELLY, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>CHARGE.  PRIVATE SECRETARY SUTEDJO JUWONO, GENERAL ELECTIONS </p><p>COMMISSIONER HAMID AWALUDIN, AND A NOTETAKER JOINED MINISTER </p><p>KALLA.  EAP SENIOR ADVISOR THERESA MCNIEL, USAID DIRECTOR, </p><p>CONTROL OFFICER LISA WILKINSON, AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ALSO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED A/S KELLY. </p><p> </p><p>IT\'S THE ECONOMY </p><p>---------------- </p><p>4. (C) A/S KELLY THANKED KALLA FOR HIS AND THE GOI\'S EFFORTS </p><p>TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO CONFLICTS IN MALUKU AND CENTRAL </p><p>SULAWESI, WHICH THE USG STRONGLY SUPPORTED.   KALLA TOLD A/S </p><p>KELLY THAT ECONOMIC MARGINALIZATION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES WAS </p><p>THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OF INDONESIA\'S COMMUNAL AND SEPARATIST </p><p>CONFLICTS.  HE TRACED THIS PHENOMENON TO SOEHARTO-ERA GOI </p><p>POLICIES, IN PARTICULAR THE GRANTING OF MONOPOLIES OVER KEY </p><p>COMMODITIES -- INCLUDING CLOVES, TIMBER, COFFEE, AND CANE FOR </p><p>FURNITURE -- TO CRONIES OF THE RULING ELITE, THUS SHUTTING </p><p>LOCAL COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE BENEFITS.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>TRANSMIGRATION POLICIES HAD CREATED RESENTMENT BY HELPING TO </p><p>DISPLACE LOCALS WITH HARDER WORKING MIGRANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) KALLA NOTED THAT THE ADVENT OF DEMOCRACY HAD ALSO </p><p>HELPED UNRAVEL ONCE CAREFULLY MANAGED BALANCES OF POWER </p><p>BETWEEN RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  IN REGIONS SUCH AS CENTRAL </p><p>SULAWESI AND MALUKU, WHERE GROUPS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES </p><p>WERE LARGE OR POPULATIONS WERE ROUGHLY BALANCED, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PARCELED OUT IMPORTANT POSITIONS AS GOVERNORS OR </p><p>DISTRICT HEADS ACCORDING TO TRADITIONS THAT REFLECTED THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF EACH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.  CURRENTLY, WHICHEVER </p><p>SIDE MUSTERED A MAJORITY IN THE LOCAL LEGISLATURE COULD FILL </p><p>THE POSITIONS OVERWHELMINGLY WITH MEMBERS OF ITS OWN </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN THE CASE OF MALUKU, HISTORIC IMBALANCES IN </p><p>EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE ALSO A FACTOR, KALLA SAID. </p><p>CHRISTIANS WERE FAR BETTER EDUCATED DURING THE COLONIAL </p><p>PERIOD, BUT LATER MOVED TO JAKARTA SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES. </p><p>MUSLIMS REPLACED THEM IN IMPORTANT POSITIONS, WHERE THEY NOW </p><p>DOMINATED.  KALLA NOTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT FIFTEEN OF </p><p>NINETEEN HEADS OF DEPARTMENT IN THE AMBON ADMINISTRATION WERE </p><p>NOW MUSLIM, EVEN THOUGH THE POPULATIONS OF THE TWO </p><p>COMMUNITIES WERE ROUGHLY BALANCED. </p><p> </p><p>EXTREMISTS ON ICE </p><p>----------------- </p><p>7. (C) THE CHARGE ASKED FOR KALLA\'S VIEWS ON A RECENT MEDIA </p><p>DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED THE ARREST OF LASKAR JIHAD LEADER JAFFAR </p><p>UMAR THALIB OVER WHETHER EXTREMIST GROUPS WERE REALLY THE </p><p>MAIN SOURCE OF PROBLEMS.  KALLA DOWNPLAYED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>SUCH GROUPS OR OFTEN-RUMORED PROVOCATION FROM OTHER POWERFUL </p><p>VESTED INTERESTS, SUGGESTING THEY WERE A SYMPTOM MORE THAN A </p><p>CAUSE OF THE CONFLICTS.  RETRACING THE HISTORY OF MALUKU, HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT IT STARTED AS A COMMUNAL CONFLICT RESULTING FROM </p><p>ECONOMIC MARGINALIZATION OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, AND THAT </p><p>FOR THE FIRST YEAR THE CHRISTIANS WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE.  IN </p><p>AN EFFORT TO TIP THE BALANCE, LASKAR JIHAD (LJ) BEGAN </p><p>MOBILIZING MUSLIMS FROM JAVA TO AMBON SIX MONTHS LATER, </p><p>GAINING FINANCIAL SUPPORT BY HIGHLIGHTING ITS HEALTH AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.  SIX MONTHS LATER, THE CHRISTIAN SIDE </p><p>PRODUCED THE MALUKU SOVEREIGNTY FRONT (FKM). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) KALLA CLAIMED THAT THIS SEQUENCE EXPLAINED WHY THE GOI </p><p>HAD FOCUSED FIRST ON REPAIRING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LOCAL </p><p>COMMUNITIES DURING THE MALINO I AND II PROCESSES (AGREEMENTS </p><p>STRUCK EARLIER THIS YEAR INTENDED TO SETTLE THE CENTRAL </p><p>SULAWESI AND MALUKU CONFLICTS, RESPECTIVELY).  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THAT EFFORT HAD BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL, NOTING THAT A </p><p>RECENT OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE IN MALUKU HAD INVOLVED ONLY </p><p>MILITIAS AND NOT LOCAL PEOPLE.  THE GOI HAD SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>ARRESTED LJ LEADER THALIB AND THE FKM\'S LEADER REMAINED IN </p><p>DETENTION, HE ADDED.  KALLA PREDICTED THE SITUATION IN MALUKU </p><p>WOULD IMPROVE IN JUNE, ALLUDING TO A DEADLINE (OFTEN EXTENDED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY) FOR OUTSIDE COMBATANTS TO WITHDRAW.  KELLY </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER AN IMPROVING SECURITY SITUATION NATIONWIDE </p><p>INDICATED THAT COMMUNAL CONFLICTS WERE A "SPENT FORCE" AND </p><p>WHETHER CONFLICT AREAS WOULD REMAIN PEACEFUL AFTER SECURITY </p><p>FORCES WERE WITHDRAWN. </p><p> </p><p>SEEKING "SHORTCUT TO PARADISE" </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>9. (C) KALLA SUGGESTED THAT SEPARATIST CONFLICTS WERE EASIER </p><p>TO RESOLVE THAN THOSE WITH RELIGIOUS OVERTONES.  THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS MILITIAS INCLUDED MANY THUGS WHO SOUGHT A "SHORTCUT </p><p>TO PARADISE" PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY </p><p>RELIGIOUS.  CONVINCED THAT HEAVEN WAS ON THEIR SIDE IN A </p><p>RELIGIOUS WAR, THESE COMBATANTS WERE UNAFRAID TO DIE.  SINCE </p><p>CHARITY ALSO EARNED ONE CREDIT TO GET INTO HEAVEN, THERE WERE </p><p>MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING FROM OUTSIDE OF INDONESIA, EAGER TO </p><p>GIVE LASKAR JIHAD MONEY.  KALLA SAID HE HAD TOLD MILITIA </p><p>MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES THAT THIS WAS NOT A LEGITIMATE </p><p>RELIGIOUS WAR, AND THAT THEIR ACTIONS WOULD LIKELY EARN THEM </p><p>A TRIP TO HELL. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS IN ACEH AND WEST PAPUA </p><p>REMAINED LARGELY BASED ON ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES, KALLA </p><p>SUGGESTED, WHILE COMPARING THE STUBBORN RESISTANCE OF THE </p><p>ACEHNESE TO THAT OF THE APACHE INDIANS.  WEST PAPUA WOULD BE </p><p>EASIER TO RESOLVE, HE ARGUED, AS THE NEW SPECIAL AUTONOMY LAW </p><p>TRANSFERRED GREATER CONTROL OF POLITICS AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RESOURCES TO THE LOCAL PEOPLE.  THE FEARLESSNESS OF HOLY </p><p>WARRIORS MADE RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS FAR BLOODIER, KALLA NOTED, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT THE ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE KILLED IN </p><p>THE MALUKU CONFLICT OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WAS TEN TIMES </p><p>THE DEATH TOLL IN ACEH.  (NOTE:  KALLA\'S ESTIMATE OF THE ACEH </p><p>DEAD APPEARS TO BE A SERIOUS UNDERESTIMATE, WITH THE DEATH </p><p>TOLL SO FAR THIS YEAR ALREADY APPROACHING FOUR HUNDRED.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) A/S KELLY THANKED KALLA FOR HIS EFFORTS IN BROKERING </p><p>THE MALINO AGREEMENTS AND IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDP\'S).  HE </p><p>REITERATED THAT THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY SUPPORTED </p><p>INDONESIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND NOTED THAT HIS DEPUTY </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY, MATHEW DALEY, HAD VISITED GAM LEADERS IN </p><p>STOCKHOLM THIS MONTH TO URGE THAT THEY ACCEPT THE ACEH </p><p>SPECIAL AUTONOMY LAW AS A BASIS FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) KALLA SAID THE IDP PROBLEM WOULD BECOME EASIER TO </p><p>SOLVE AS SECURITY IMPROVED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  NOTING </p><p>THAT HE WOULD ACCOMPANY PRESIDENT MEGAWATI TO EAST TIMOR\'S </p><p>MAY 19 INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATION, KALLA PROJECTED THAT AS MANY </p><p>AS FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE REMAINING FIFTY THOUSAND IDP\'S IN WEST </p><p>TIMOR MIGHT RETURN HOME BY AUGUST.  A/S KELLY PRAISED </p><p>MEGAWATI\'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CELEBRATION, NOTING THAT </p><p>SHE TOOK A POLITICAL RISK IN DOING SO BUT THAT IT WOULD HELP </p><p>ENCOURAGE IDP\'S TO RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>THE SOLUTION -- ENDING POVERTY, IMPROVING EDUCATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>13. (C) KALLA STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF POVERTY REDUCTION IN </p><p>RESOLVING ALL OF INDONESIA\'S SEPARATIST AND COMMUNAL </p><p>CONFLICTS.  THE GOI WOULD FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON IMPROVING </p><p>HEALTH, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES AND BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>WHILE LEAVING "THE REST TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR."  OVER THE </p><p>LONGER TERM, THE GOI HAD TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO </p><p>ADDRESS BOTH ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) A/S KELLY ASKED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES TOUCHING ON </p><p>KALLA\'S AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, INCLUDING HEALTH AND THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  KALLA RESPONDED THAT IN ITS APPROACH TO HEALTH </p><p>CARE, THE GOI WAS RETURNING TO THE TRADITION OF HAVING </p><p>CLINICS IN EACH VILLAGE STAFFED AT MINIMUM WITH A NURSE </p><p>CAPABLE OF DOING IMMUNIZATIONS.  KALLA DOWNPLAYED CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT AN EL NINO-INDUCED DROUGHT THIS YEAR, SAYING HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT STOCKS OF RICE WERE SUFFICIENT TO AVOID A </p><p>LARGE-SCALE DISASTER.  RECALLING JAKARTA\'S SEVERE FLOODS </p><p>EARLY THIS YEAR, KALLA NOTED THAT FLOODS COULD BE AS </p><p>DANGEROUS AS DROUGHT. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) KALLA POINTED OUT THAT DURING INDONESIA\'S 1998 </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS, IT HAD NOT BEEN DROUGHT BUT RATHER </p><p>ACCOMPANYING FOREST FIRES THAT HAD DONE THE MOST DAMAGE. </p><p>KALLA SUGGESTED THE RISK OF A REPETITION OF EL NINO MAY </p><p>NEARLY HAVE PASSED, AS MAY AND JUNE TENDED TO BE THE DRIEST </p><p>MONTHS.  A/S KELLY ASKED KALLA ABOUT THE CONDITION OF </p><p>INDONESIA\'S CORAL REEFS.  THE MINISTER ASSERTED THAT </p><p>FISHERMEN ARE BETTER TRAINED THAN PREVIOUSLY TO AVOID </p><p>DYNAMITE FISHING, BUT THAT THE GOI NEEDED MORE CAPACITY TO </p><p>POLICE ITS WATERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) SOURCES SAY THAT KALLA, WITH HIS BUSINESS BACKGROUND, </p><p>APPROACHES HIS JOB WITH A CAN-DO ATTITUDE THAT BORDERS ON </p><p>NAIVETE.  BUT HIS EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IS </p><p>REFRESHING IN A PLACE WHERE EVERY UNFORTUNATE EVENT IS SEEN </p><p>AS THE WORK OF MALEVOLENT AND UNSEEN HANDS, WHOSE FEARED </p><p>POWER THEN BECOMES AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION.  THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>LASKAR JIHAD IN MALUKU IS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO PEACE, AND </p><p>THE REAL REASON THE GOI HAS NOT EVICTED THEM IS FEAR OF AN </p><p>ISLAMIST POLITICAL BACKLASH.  BUT KALLA IS RIGHT TO KEEP THE </p><p>MILITIAS AND RUMORS OF MILITARY PROVOCATEURS INTO </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOI MUST LEARN HOW TO HANDLE THE LIKES OF </p><p>LASKAR JIHAD, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  MEANWHILE, A LOT </p><p>COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IF THE GOI STARTED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON </p><p>KALLA\'S OWN PRESCRIPTION: POVERTY REDUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS </p><p>TO HEALTH, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITION. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) A/S KELLY HAS CLEARED THIS MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MULL </p><p></p></div>
