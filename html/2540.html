<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/28/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: WEEKLY POLITICAL WRAP UP - FEB 25 TO MAR 1 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Andrews for reason 1.5 (d.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Cabinet Reshuffle In The Works? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Senate on February 27 consented to the </p><p>President\'s February 26 nomination of Dr. Olu Agunloye as </p><p>Minister without Portfolio. Agunloye, a physicist by </p><p>training, was a close friend of slain Attorney General Ige. </p><p>Like Ige, Agunloye hails from the Southwest and is a member </p><p>of the Yoruba-dominated Alliance of Democracy political </p><p>party. Some Senators speculated during his brief appearance </p><p>before them that eventually Agunloye will head the Ministry </p><p>of Solid Minerals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Obasanjo\'s critics, particularly those in the North, </p><p>will see Agunloye\'s appointment as added  evidence that </p><p>Obasanjo has embraced a "Southwest" strategy of solidifying </p><p>ties to his Yoruba homeland in the run up to the 2003 </p><p>election.  Many in the North believe that Obasanjo is </p><p>pursuing this strategy to the point of ignoring Northern </p><p>leaders, and their concerns.  If Agunloye is given the solid </p><p>minerals brief, these Northerners will see his appointment as </p><p>detrimental to their interests. Much of Nigeria\'s solid </p><p>mineral deposits are in the North.  Some Northerners will </p><p>view Aguunloye as an interloper trying to control the </p><p>resources and revenues from resources which they believe more </p><p>rightfully should be controlled by one of their own. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Agunloye\'s appointment also has revived speculation </p><p>about a major cabinet reshuffling.  Obasanjo has to be aware </p><p>that his popularity is flagging and that his Administration </p><p>needs a tonic. A cabinet reshuffling would give him leave to </p><p>jettison some non-performing ministers under the pretext that </p><p>he is freeing them from their duties to allow them to pursue </p><p>their ambitions for elective office. However, removing </p><p>ministers is only half the equation.  The other half is their </p><p>replacements.  The reshuffling will not improve Obasanjo\'s </p><p>political standing unless replacements are a cut above their </p><p>predecessors.  With only a year left in his term, convincing </p><p>honest, highly competent people to take jobs for such a brief </p><p>duration will be difficult unless Obasanjo has plans beyond </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Waiting to Hear From Above </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Despite the intensified speculation about a cabinet </p><p>reshuffling and a 2003 reelection bid, President Obasanjo </p><p>continues to hold those with inquiring minds at bay. </p><p>Deflecting an inquiry made by a women\'s group paying a call </p><p>on him, Obasanjo reminded the group that he said he would </p><p>take his instruction from God but as of yet had not received </p><p>his celestial instructions. However, Obasanjo said he </p><p>expected to receive his orders "very soon." (Comment: </p><p>Obasanjo is a religious man and appeals to religion are </p><p>commonplace in all aspects of Nigerian life, including </p><p>politics. While those who like Obasanjo will consider his </p><p>statement as a sign of piety, many critics are beyond giving </p><p>him the benefit of the doubt, spiritually, politically or </p><p>otherwise. Some have openly poked fun at his statements about </p><p>divine instruction.  They believe that the voice he finally </p><p>hears will tell him to run simply because that voice will be </p><p>his own.  End comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>President and House Remain at Loggerheads </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The financial disclosure standoff between the </p><p>Presidency and House of Assembly entered its second week. </p><p>Speaker Na\'abba claims the House is almost out of funds for </p><p>its operations but that he will not buckle to Obasanjo\'s </p><p>demands to furnish an accounting of members\' salaries and </p><p>other emoluments. Na\'abba\'s position is that the Revenue </p><p>Mobilization and Fiscal Commission, an arm of the executive, </p><p>has this information as it is the body that actually </p><p>calculates payments to members. Obasanjo had barred the </p><p>payment of salaries and other funds to the House until the </p><p>Speaker complies with his disclosure requests; however, the </p><p>President did agree to partial payment earlier this week </p><p>after the intercession of Senate President Anyim and PDP </p><p>Chairman Ogbeh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) This impasse has affected the 2002 budget process as </p><p>the House has delayed consideration of the measure, citing </p><p>the lack of money as impairing its ability to function. </p><p>Additionally, Na\'abba has filed suit seeking an order </p><p>compelling Obasanjo to release the funds. (Comment:  This is </p><p>the latest in a string of rows between Na\'abba and Obasanjo. </p><p>If one did not know better, it would seem the two were in </p><p>different political parties.  Since they are not, it appears </p><p>that Na\'abba is consciously staking out a position as an </p><p>independent, if sometimes opposing power node to Obasanjo </p><p>within the party itself.  While probably excluding himself </p><p>from the "Friends of Olusegun" list, this ploy will likely </p><p>boost Na\'abba\'s appeal among disenchanted elements in the </p><p>party as well as with members of the Northern elite critical </p><p>of Obasanjo.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Firings at the Electoral Commission </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Out of the blue, President Obasanjo dismissed 34 of </p><p>37 Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC).  Although having </p><p>their offices in the 36 states and the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory, RECs belong to the Independent Electoral </p><p>Commission hierarchy, not the state electoral apparatus. </p><p>While the President\'s action were undisputedly within his </p><p>constitutional prerogative, the action might not go down well </p><p>politically. For some, the excuse that the REC\'s were </p><p>dismissed at the behest of the governors of the affected </p><p>states due to security reasons or for corruption does not </p><p>hold water. There was no inkling that any of them was under </p><p>investigation nor has any incriminating evidence been </p><p>disclosed. Moreover, the 34 dismissed RECs were appointees of </p><p>former Head of State Abubakar while the three who escaped the </p><p>axe were recent Obasanjo appointees.  This has some observers </p><p>suspecting that Obasanjo is trying to stack the electoral </p><p>deck with his acolytes. Should he go ahead and appoint known </p><p>loyalists to the positions, many people will begin to cry </p><p>that an electoral foul has been committed. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
