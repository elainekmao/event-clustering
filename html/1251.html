(C) NEW INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER </p><p>NKOSANA MOYO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR AUGUST 15 THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WAS DETERMINED TO SEIZE 3,000 FARMS AND HAD NO </p><p>INTENTION OF PROVIDING COMPENSATION.  MOYO CLAIMED THAT </p><p>MOST CABINET MEMBERS WERE IN FAVOR OF A FAIR, </p><p>TRANSPARENT LAND REFORM EFFORT, AND ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO RESETTLED FAMILIES.  MOYO </p><p>SHARED THE AMBASSADOR\'S CONCERN ABOUT LAWLESSNESS IN THE </p><p>RURAL AREAS.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT SEIZURE OF </p><p>FARMS WITHOUT COMPENSATION IS ILLEGAL AND IS NEARLY </p><p>ELIMINATING ANY NEW FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND SAID THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS WOULD SPEAK LOUDER THAN ITS WORDS. </p><p>MOYO IS AN ACCOMPLISHED BUSINESSPERSON AND A CAPABLE </p><p>POLITICAL INDEPENDENT WHO INTENDS TO WORK TO REVERSE SOME </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S RUINOUS POLICIES.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MOYO\'S OBJECTIVES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ASKED RECENTLY-APPOINTED </p><p>MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE NKOSANA MOYO </p><p>ON AUGUST 16 WHAT HE HOPED TO ACCOMPLISH IN HIS NEW </p><p>POSITION.  MOYO SAID HIS PRIMARY FOCUS WOULD BE TO HELP </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT FORGE A MORE COOPERATIVE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  HE ALSO PLANNED TO </p><p>TRY TO REPAIR SOME OF ZIMBABWE\'S BILATERAL AND </p><p>MULTILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>LAND REFORM </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MOYO THEN TURNED TO THE LAND QUESTION, </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM OF LAWLESSNESS ON THE FARMS. </p><p>HE TERMED THE GOVERNMENT\'S PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORT </p><p>"APPALLING," AND SAID IT MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF </p><p>EXPLAINING THE RATIONALE FOR ITS ACTIONS.  PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IS SERIOUS ABOUT SEIZING 3,000 FARMS AND WANTS ALL </p><p>OF THEM IDENTIFIED NOW AND RESETTLED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>MOYO EXPRESSED HIS VIEW THAT MANY OF THESE FARMS HAD LONG </p><p>BEEN IDLE, SO THEIR RESETTLEMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A SERIOUS </p><p>IMPACT ON PRODUCTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04611  01 OF 03  171638Z </p><p>HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EFFORT AND THAT SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY HURT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS, HE STRESSED, ARE ILLEGAL, HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY </p><p>DISRUPTIVE, AND GIVE ZIMBABWE A BLACK EYE ABROAD.  THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AGREES THAT LAND REFORM IS NECESSARY AND A </p><p>MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A </p><p>FAIR, TRANSPARENT PROCESS.  IN ADDITION, SEIZURES OF </p><p>FARMS WITHOUT COMPENSATION WILL SOUR RENEWED DONOR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LAND REFORM.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ADDRESS THIS AND ITS OTHER ECONOMIC PROBLEMS </p><p>SERIOUSLY, AS MORE AND MORE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING MINING, </p><p>ARE SUFFERING, AND THE PATIENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IS WEARING THIN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MOYO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE </p><p>UNABLE TO PROVIDE RESETTLED FAMILIES WITH SIGNIFICANT </p><p>RESOURCES, BUT THOUGHT MANY WERE PEASANT FARMERS WHO </p><p>WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES.  HE AGREED THAT </p><p>COMPENSATION WAS IMPORTANT BUT DID NOT THINK HE COULD </p><p>REVERSE THE GOVERNMENT\'S DETERMINATION NOT TO PAY FOR THE </p><p>SEIZED FARMS.  THE GOVERNMENT, MOYO ADMITTED, HAS DUG </p><p>ITSELF INTO A HOLE, BUT ITS PRIDE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO DIG ITSELF OUT.

WITHOUT ELABORATING, HE SAID </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HAD GIVEN HIM THE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD ON A RANGE OF KEY ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>USED LAND REFORM AS A POLITICAL TOOL TO GARNER ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPPORT.  MOYO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LAND REFORM IS A </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUE FOR SOME CABINET MEMBERS, BUT NOT FOR </p><p>MUGABE, WHO PERCEIVES IT AS A CORRECTION OF AN INJUSTICE. </p><p>MOYO SAID HE THOUGHT SOME POSITIVE MOVEMENT COULD BE </p><p>ACHIEVED ON LAND REFORM, SINCE MOST OF THE CABINET WAS ON </p><p>THE "RIGHT SIDE" OF THE ISSUE.  HE THOUGHT MUGABE COULD </p><p>BE CONVINCED TO TONE DOWN HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC, BUT SAID </p><p>HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS WITH INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO, WHO CAN DO THE MOST DAMAGE.  A CHANGE IN RHETORIC </p><p>WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, BUT </p><p>POSITIVE, CONCRETE ACTIONS WOULD SEND THE MOST POWERFUL </p><p>MESSAGE.  THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT, HE EMPHASIZED, WAS THAT </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE RESTORED.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>THE U.S. WANTS TO HELP, BUT NOT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04611  02 OF 03  171639Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW PARLIAMENT AND MOYO\'S ROLE IN CABINET </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ASKED FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT, </p><p>MOYO SAID BOTH THE RULING ZANU-PF AND THE MDC ARE SHOWING </p><p>"INCREDIBLE IMMATURITY," WHICH WOULD PROBABLY PREVENT HIM </p><p>FROM JOINING A POLITICAL PARTY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER MOYO FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CABINET, GIVEN HIS REPUTATION AS A </p><p>POLITICAL INDEPENDENT (REFTEL).  ON THE CONTRARY, MOYO </p><p>REPLIED.  HE FELT INCREDIBLE FREEDOM AND WAS NOW </p><p>CONVINCED THAT NOT JOINING A POLITICAL PARTY WAS THE BEST </p><p>THING HE HAD EVER DONE.  HE HAD NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO JOIN </p><p>ZANU-PF AND, IN FACT, HAD GIVEN A SPEECH ON ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>TELEVISION AFTER HIS APPOINTMENT MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE </p><p>WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE RULING PARTY AND EXPRESSING HIS </p><p>DETERMINATION TO BE A MINISTER FOR THE COUNTRY AS A </p><p>WHOLE.  MANY PEOPLE SUBSEQUENTLY HAD ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD </p><p>JOINED THE CABINET.  HE TOLD THEM HE CONSIDERED IT HIS </p><p>OBLIGATION TO DO ALL HE COULD TO PREVENT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>SHIP FROM SINKING. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ASKED HOW THE GOVERNMENT PLANNED TO ADDRESS ITS </p><p>SERIOUS ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, MOYO SAID HE IS WORKING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI ON NEXT STEPS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04611  02 OF 03  171639Z </p><p>IN THE NEAR TERM, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TALKED TO THE DUTCH </p><p>ABOUT ACQUIRING ASSISTANCE TARGETTED AT RESETTLEMENT OF A </p><p>LIMITED NUMBER OF FARMS, AS WELL AS THE FUEL AND </p><p>ELECTRICITY SECTORS.  IN ADDITION, THE CABINET HAD </p><p>APPROVED THE MILLENIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN THE </p><p>PREVIOUS WEEK.  THE PLAN SEEKS, INTER ALIA, TO REDUCE THE </p><p>BUDGET DEFICIT FROM 14 TO 10 PERCENT, ESTABLISH A </p><p>REALISTIC EXCHANGE RATE, DOWNSIZE THE BLOATED CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE, AND RE-ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH THE IFI\'S. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN, MOYO CONTINUED, ALSO </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED TO BETTER "MANAGE" THE ISSUE OF TROOPS </p><p>IN THE DROC.  HE ASKED WHY UN TROOPS HAD NOT YET BEEN </p><p>DEPLOYED THERE.  MONUC DEPLOYMENT HAD NOT BEEN EXPANDED, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED, BECAUSE SUFFICIENT SAFETY </p><p>GUARANTEES WERE NOT IN PLACE.  BEFORE SUCH A DEPLOYMENT </p><p>COULD OCCUR, KABILA HAD TO MEET HIS LUSAKA ACCORDS </p><p>COMMITMENTS, AND ZIMBABWE COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN </p><p>PRESSING KABILA TO DO SO, THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.
