<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PPC, WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KJUS, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: BATTLE OVER CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION RAGES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  On December 4, the Supreme Court took the </p><p>first step in analyzing constitutional amendments proposed by </p><p>Congress that would give Congress unfettered power to </p><p>interpret the constitutionality of laws they pass.  The </p><p>Constitutional Chamber of the Court asked Congress to explain </p><p>why it was attempting to alter the Constitution in a manner </p><p>that ostensibly usurps traditional judicial authority.  If </p><p>the amendments become effective, the judiciary will lose its </p><p>authority to construe the Constitution, and Congress will be </p><p>free to interpret the constitutionality of laws with a </p><p>two-thirds majority vote.  Three weeks ago, the National </p><p>Human Rights Commission filed a lawsuit asking that the </p><p>Supreme Court declare the proposals unconstitutional and in </p><p>violation of the "separation of powers" provision in the </p><p>Constitution.  The Attorney General will soon be issuing an </p><p>opinion regarding the legality of the proposed amendments. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONGRESSIONAL PROPOSAL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On December 4, the Supreme Court took the first step </p><p>in analyzing a constitutional amendment proposed by the </p><p>National Congress that would give Congress unfettered power </p><p>to interpret the Constitution.  The Constitutional Chamber of </p><p>the Supreme Court asked Congress to explain its motives </p><p>behind the unprecedented attempt to give itself unlimited </p><p>authority to interpret the Honduran Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On November 13, 2002, the National Human Rights </p><p>Commission, with the support of civil society, filed a </p><p>lawsuit alleging that the Congressional move violates the </p><p>separation of powers provision of the Constitution and thus </p><p>is unconstitutional.  The Court has not yet ruled on the </p><p>issue, but is expected to do so between now and when Congress </p><p>reconvenes on January 25, 2003.  (Note:  The Supreme Court is </p><p>scheduled to recess between December 15 and January 6.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY WEIGH IN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Attorney General\'s Office will soon issue a legal </p><p>opinion about the legality of the proposed amendments. </p><p>Attorney General Roy Medina said that his office previously </p><p>issued an opinion on this subject, and that the previous </p><p>opinion will be released at the same time as the new one. </p><p>While Attorney General opinions tend to carry great weight, </p><p>they do not amount to law and, therefore, do not have to be </p><p>followed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  On December 10, 2002, the Coalition for the </p><p>Strengthening of Justice (made up of several civil society </p><p>organizations) launched a campaign to increase public </p><p>awareness and stimulate policy dialogue about the issue.  The </p><p>Coalition staunchly opposes the attempts by the National </p><p>Congress to usurp judicial review and undermine the </p><p>separation of powers.  Its campaign will focus on defending </p><p>the Constitution, and will include advertisements on radio, </p><p>television and in the newspapers.  (Note:  Civil society </p><p>helped the Human Rights Commission prepare its legal brief </p><p>for the challenge before the Supreme Court.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ABOUT THE LAW... </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) There are actually two (2) constitutional </p><p>amendments at stake.  The first amends section 218(9) of the </p><p>Constitution and eliminates the President\'s power to veto </p><p>Congressional interpretation of the Constitution.  The </p><p>section 218(9) amendment was passed last year, presumably in </p><p>anticipation of more recent attempts to alter the </p><p>Constitution.  The lawsuit filed by the Human Rights </p><p>Commission is primarily based on the section 218(9) </p><p>amendment.  Congress is in the process of trying to pass an </p><p>amendment to section 205(10) of the Constitution--a change </p><p>that would expressly bestow upon Congress exclusive </p><p>interpretive authority.  (Note: The aforementioned lawsuit </p><p>also refers to the section 205(10) issue, which is arguably </p><p>not yet ripe for official judicial review.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) If the amendments become final, Congress would have </p><p>unlimited power to interpret the Honduran Constitution.  The </p><p>proposed constitutional amendment (205(10)) would permit </p><p>Congress to construe the Constitution with a two-thirds vote </p><p>in just one (1) regular session of Congress.  Constitutional </p><p>interpretation of laws is traditionally the role of the </p><p>judiciary, and such judicial review is an integral part of </p><p>the "separation of powers" concept in a democratic system. </p><p>(Note:  The Honduran Constitution contains a separation of </p><p>powers provision.  End Note.)  Moreover, the President would </p><p>have no veto power over this type of Congressional action </p><p>(under the amendment to section 218(9)), meaning that the </p><p>Congress could make constitutional determinations without any </p><p>"check and balances." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The proposed amendments would thwart judicial review </p><p>of the constitutionality of Honduran laws and represent a </p><p>clear threat to the concept of separation of powers--which is </p><p>a cornerstone of a democratic system and judicial </p><p>independence.  Pursuant to Honduran law, the Constitutional </p><p>Chamber of the Supreme Court is responsible for protecting </p><p>the integrity of the Constitution.  Should Congress succeed </p><p>in usurping the Court\'s powers, the stability and </p><p>independence of the Supreme Court will be seriously </p><p>compromised as would a basic tenant of democracy. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Conventional wisdom suggests that the Supreme Court </p><p>will likely rule that the amendments should not take effect </p><p>because they are unconstitutional and improper.  It is </p><p>uncertain what position the Attorney General will take, but </p><p>more likely than not he will cite the separation of powers </p><p>requirement in the Constitution and find that the proposed </p><p>changes are unlawful.  End Comment. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
