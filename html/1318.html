IN A BIZARRE OUTBRIEF ON OCTOBER 12, </p><p>THE UN/UNDP TEAM SENT TO EXPLORE WAYS TO BRIDGE THE GAP </p><p>BETWEEN DONORS AND GOVERNMENT ON LAND REFORM MADE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO "IMPROVE" THE FAST TRACK </p><p>PROGRAM.  THE TEAM STRESSED THAT THEIR MANDATE WAS </p><p>TECHNICAL -- NOT POLITICAL.  DONOR QUESTIONS WERE </p><p>LIMITED BUT THERE WAS A PALPABLE SENSE OF DISBELIEF AND </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MISSION.  GIVEN THE NARROW MANDATE </p><p>OF THE MISSION, THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW WAS NOT ADDRESSED.  WE THINK THAT THE PARALLEL UN </p><p>INITIATIVE TO EXAMINE THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE </p><p>ENCOURAGED WHILE PUTTING ON HOLD ANY FURTHER TECHNICAL </p><p>MISSIONS TO WORK ON A VIABLE LAND PROGRAM.  POST </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE LATTER CAN BE CONDUCTED ON THE GROUND </p><p>BY DONORS, WHILE THE UN CAN MOST PRODUCTIVELY HELP </p><p>ADDRESS THE RULE OF LAW ISSUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05834  01 OF 04  131121Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON OCTOBER 12 UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>VICTOR ANGELO INTRODUCED THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE UN/UNDP </p><p>TEAM WHO BRIEFED HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC AND SELECTED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE MISSIONS ON RECOMMENDATIONS THAT </p><p>WOULD APPEAR IN THEIR FINAL REPORT TO THE UNDP </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL.  (COMMENT: </p><p>DONORS WERE SURPRISED AT THE UNDP RESREP\'S INVITATION TO </p><p>THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVE, AS </p><p>WELL AS HEADS OF MISSION OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND THE G-77.  ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF </p><p>THE PARTICIPANTS WERE NEW FACES AND FEW OF THEM </p><p>POTENTIAL DONORS.  THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE WAS CONSPICUOUS BY HIS ABSENCE.  END </p><p>COMMENT).  ANGELO SAID THAT AFTER THREE WEEKS IN COUNTRY </p><p>CONSULTING WITH A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAD GIVEN THE TEAM ALL THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE THAT IT NEEDED, AND HAD RECEIVED THE TEAM AT </p><p>THE HIGHEST LEVEL.  ANGELO NOTED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>WAS KEPT REGULARLY UPDATED ON THE TEAM\'S FINDINGS. </p><p>SPEAKING FOR THE TEAM, CHIEF OF PARTY JACQUES CHONCHOL </p><p>FOUND THAT THERE IS BROAD AGREEMENT WITHIN ZIMBABWE </p><p>AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT: </p><p> </p><p>-- LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE IS A POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION; </p><p> </p><p>-- IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A WORKABLE LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM; </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05834  01 OF 04  131121Z </p><p>-- THE DESIGN WILL REQUIRE CONSTANT CONSULTATION OF ALL </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS; </p><p> </p><p>--THE PLAN MUST BE TRANSPARENT IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION, </p><p>ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND JUST; AND </p><p> </p><p>--THE LAWS OF ZIMBABWE MUST BE OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL PHASES OF THE PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMPLEMENTING THOSE OBSERVATIONS CHONCHOL NOTED </p><p>THAT DISAGREEMENT EXISTED ON THE: </p><p> </p><p>-- SCALE AND PACE OF THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE; </p><p> </p><p>-- POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS UNDERLYING THE FAST </p><p>TRACK APPROACH; </p><p> </p><p>-- EXTENT AND WILLINGNESS OF THE PARTIES TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>KEY ISSUES; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- AVAILABILITY OF FINANCE.  CHONCHOL SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE BELIEVED IT HAD BEEN PUSHED TO </p><p>ADOPT THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE BECAUSE IT </p><p>DID NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7499 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05834  02 OF 04  131121Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------913F2C  131122Z /38 </p><p>P 131122Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7360 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 005834 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05834  02 OF 04  131121Z </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDERRYCK AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/13/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/UNDP TEAM GIVES OUTBRIEF: RESULTS </p><p>DISAPPOINTING </p><p> </p><p>DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE UN/UNDP MISSION CHIEF OF PARTY CONTINUED </p><p>WITH THE CAVEAT THAT POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FELL </p><p>OUTSIDE THE TEAM\'S MANDATE.  THE TEAM VISITED VARIOUS </p><p>SETTLEMENTS AND NOTICED THAT THE FAST TRACK EXERCISE HAD </p><p>RUN INTO DIFFICULTIES: THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO RESOURCES </p><p>FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OR AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR THOSE </p><p>RESETTLED, THERE WAS INADEQUATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY </p><p>AS WELL AS A CUMBERSOME STATUTORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  IN LIGHT OF THESE FACTS, THE TEAM\'S REPORT </p><p>WILL MAKE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL </p><p>EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM: </p><p> </p><p>-- ESTABLISHMENT OF A TRUST FUND ADMINISTERED BY UNDP </p><p>AND FINANCED BY DONORS TO PURCHASE AND UPGRADE ACQUIRED </p><p>LAND, UNDER THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE.  IT </p><p>SHOULD ENCOMPASS AN ORDERLY PROCESS OF RESETTLEMENT AND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP FURTHER OCCUPATIONS.  A </p><p>COMMITTEE WOULD OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, THE </p><p>DONORS AND UNDP. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05834  02 OF 04  131121Z </p><p> </p><p>--FOUNDING OF A TRAINING INSTITUTE; </p><p> </p><p>-- SIMPLIFICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL </p><p>PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO LAND ACQUISITION AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEEDS TO BE </p><p>DECENTRALIZED; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- USING A PROPORTION OF THE TRUST FUND TO SUPPLEMENT </p><p>THE BUDGET FOR SALARIES AND SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT STAFF </p><p>WHO WOULD IMPLEMENT THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) KICKING OFF THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, THE </p><p>NEW ZEALAND HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHETHER THE TRAINING </p><p>INSTITUTE THE TEAM ADVOCATED WAS TO BE SOMETHING NEW, </p><p>BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS LITTERED WITH SUCH INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND MANY OF WHOSE GRADUATES WERE QUALIFIED FARMERS WHO </p><p>WERE NOT BEING PLACED ON LAND.  HE ALSO ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE TRUST FUND RECOMMENDATION HARKED BACK TO THE RESULTS </p><p>OF THE 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE.  CHONCHOL REPLIED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE A NEW INSTITUTION ON THE MODEL OF THOSE SET UP </p><p>IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAD PROVEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. </p><p>ZIMBABWE LACKED CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT A PROPER LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM, IT NEEDED TO TRAIN TECHNICIANS, PEASANT </p><p>LEADERS, AND PROPERLY ORGANIZE CO-OPERATIVES, AMONG </p><p>OTHER THINGS.  REGARDING THE TRUST FUND, CHONCHOL SAID </p><p>THAT IT WOULD ALSO BE SOMETHING NEW, ADMINISTERED BY THE </p><p>DONORS, GOVERNMENT AND THE UNDP. </p><p> </p><p>--THE DANISH AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT WAS THE TIME FRAME </p><p>THE TEAM ENVISIONED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05834  02 OF 04  131121Z </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM.  THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE GOZ OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF 5 MILLION HECTARES COULD BE ACHIEVED IN THREE TO FOUR </p><p>YEARS BASED ON AN ANNUAL ROLLING PLANNING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AUSTRALIAN AID REPRESENTATIVE ASKED FOR THE </p><p>TEAM\'S ESTIMATE OF THE TRUST FUND.  CHONCHOL AVOIDED </p><p>ANSWERING THE QUESTION BY SAYING THAT IT DEPENDED </p><p>WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT MERELY PLANNED TO DUMP PEOPLE ON </p><p>THE LAND OR MAKE ADEQUATE PREPARATIONS.  UNDP RESREP </p><p>ANGELO REJOINED THAT THE TEAM WOULD PROPOSE THREE </p><p>INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE RESETTLEMENT MODELS, BUT </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT AT A MINIMUM IT WOULD COST BETWEEN USD </p><p>3,000 TO 3,200 PER FAMILY.  (COMMENT: THERE IS NOTHING </p><p>NEW IN THIS REVELATION.  THESE ARE OLD NUMBERS.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>--THE WORLD BANK REPRESENTATIVE ASKED WHETHER A SOUND </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAM COULD BE BASED ON COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION AND WHETHER THE FAST TRACK APPROACH WAS </p><p>TECHNICALLY SOUND.  CHONCHOL CONCEDED THAT THE APPROACH </p><p>WAS NOT OPTIMAL. </p><p> </p><p>--THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT THE TEAM\'S POSITION </p><p>REGARDING THE HANDLING OF THE CURRENT FARM INVADERS AND </p><p>QUESTIONED THE TEAM\'S PRO-GOVERNMENT BIAS.

WHEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSE FURTHER </p><p>QUESTIONS THE HIGH COMMISSIONER DEMURRED, BUT HIS BODY </p><p>LANGUAGE CONVEYED DISBELIEF. </p><p> </p><p>--THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE </p><p>BETWEEN THE 1998 AGREEMENT AND THE FAST TRACK APPROACH. </p><p>THE TEAM RESPONDED THAT THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE WAS THAT </p><p>THE FAST TRACK APPROACH IS ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE ALL </p><p>LAND "UP FRONT" VERSUS THE PHASED APPROACH AGREED UPON </p><p>IN 1998.  THE OTHER MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THE BASIS </p><p>(IMPROVEMENTS ONLY) AND METHOD OF COMPENSATION (DELAYED </p><p>PAYMENTS INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF BONDS). </p><p> </p><p>--THE PLO REPRESENTATIVE (AND DEAN OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05834  03 OF 04  131122Z </p><p>CORPS) CONTRIBUTION WAS TO SUGGEST THAT WHILE PALESTINE </p><p>IS NOT A DONOR BUT A RECIPIENT OF ASSISTANCE, HE THOUGHT </p><p>THE QUESTIONS POSED WERE PREMATURE AND THAT WE SHOULD </p><p>WAIT FOR THE TEAM\'S REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>THE REPORT, THE GROUP WAS INFORMED THAT THE MISSION </p><p>WOULD FIRST DISCUSS IT WITH THE UN BEGINNING OCTOBER 15. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN A RUMP SESSION, WORLD BANK, DFID AND USAID </p><p>MET TO DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS OF THE MISSION.  THE </p><p>CONSENSUS WAS THAT THE MEETING WAS BIZARRE AND THE </p><p>MISSION FAILED TO ADVANCE THE DIALOGUE ON THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW OR CLARIFY THE TECHNICAL ISSUES.  RATHER, THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TINKER ON THE EDGES OF A FUNDAMENTALLY </p><p>FLAWED APPROACH.  THE WORLD BANK REPRESENTATIVE OBSERVED </p><p>THAT MOST DONORS PRESENT WERE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT </p><p>THE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAN THE TEAM.  OVERALL THE CONCERN </p><p>WAS THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT COULD USE RESULTS OF </p><p>THIS MISSION TO JUSTIFY UNLEASHING FURTHER LAWLESSNESS, </p><p>BECAUSE DONORS ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL FAIL TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PROPOSED TRUST FUND.  THERE IS ALSO WIDESPREAD BELIEF </p><p>HERE THAT THE GOZ WILL LOSE THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' </p><p>UNION\'S COURT CHALLENGE.  THE SUPREME COURT LIKELY WILL </p><p>RULE THAT THE USE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS TO AMEND BOTH </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAND ACT WILL BE RULED </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE FEAR IS THAT THE GOZ WILL THEN </p><p>JUSTIFY FURTHER INVASIONS AND LAND SEIZURES GIVEN THE </p><p>DESPERATE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND THE NEED FOR ZANU-PF TO </p><p>DELIVER ON SOMETHING TO ITS RURAL CONSTITUENCY BEFORE </p><p>THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05834  03 OF 04  131122Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: AS WE SUSPECTED, THE MAJOR THRUST OF </p><p>THE TEAM\'S RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO RATIONALIZE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK APPROACH TO LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  THIS RESULT WAS NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN THE </p><p>NARROW AND TECHNICAL TERMS OF REFERENCE UNDER WHICH THE </p><p>TEAM OPERATED.  THE ATTEMPT TO SEGREGATE THE TECHNICAL </p><p>FROM THE POLITICAL WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK BECAUSE LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE IS NOW ESSENTIALLY A POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS.
