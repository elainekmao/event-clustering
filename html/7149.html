WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: KUWAIT OIL UPDATE -- APRIL 05, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1232 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Detailed oil production for Kuwait Oil Company was not </p><p>available today, but production likely remains just under 2.4 </p><p>million barrels. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EconChief had a chance to visit the two wells in the </p><p>Rumeila field of Southern Iraq that continue burning.  One </p><p>well is burning crude oil, emitting a plume of thick black </p><p>smoke.  The KOC firefighting team is on site at the well. </p><p>KOC had earlier tried to extinguish the fire using water from </p><p>trucks, but ran out of water before the fire was put out. </p><p>They have now dug a lagoon which they had filled with water, </p><p>and preparations for another attempt were being made as of </p><p>the early afternoon.  If successful, the fire would be out by </p><p>sundown. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The other well is burning gas, with a very hot flame </p><p>but a much cleaner smoke plume.  Boots and Coots (B and C) </p><p>officials told EconChief that once KOC had its fire out, </p><p>water trucks would focus on filling the lagoon B and C had </p><p>dug.  Once filled, B and C would then begin efforts to </p><p>control the second well.  If all goes according to plan, the </p><p>two fires could be out by Monday or Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Local Arabic press today reported that the KOC will </p><p>suspend its operations in Iraq after the two fires still </p><p>burning in Rumeila are extinguished, leaving any remaining or </p><p>new fires to B and C. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
