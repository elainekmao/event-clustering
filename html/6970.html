U.S. officials believe that a verbal </p><p>understanding regarding Iraq\'s territorial integrity should </p><p>be sufficient for Ankara.  U.S. Presidential Envoy </p><p>Khalilzad\'s meetings in Ankara will continue on Monday. </p><p>Khalilzad told the Turkish side that Northern Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>groups welcomed the statement by TGS Chief General Ozkok. </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan assured a German daily that Turkey </p><p>has no intention to occupy Northern Iraq.  Iranian Foreign </p><p>Minister Kharrazi said that Turkey\'s concerns over Iraq\'s </p><p>territorial integrity are understandable, but that Tehran is </p><p>against a Turkish military presence in Northern Iraq, </p><p>"Aksam" reports.  Meanwhile, Turkey\'s former president </p><p>Suleyman Demirel slammed the AKP government for `damaging </p><p>the 50-year old friendship with the U.S. for nothing.\' </p><p>Demirel said Prime Minister Erdogan\'s maneuvers proved that </p><p>he could not be trusted.  He also voiced concern that Turkey </p><p>might be blamed for not opening a Northern Front if the war </p><p>takes longer than expected and leads to increased </p><p>casualties.  `Turkey should have joined the international </p><p>coalition if it wanted to have a role in Northern Iraq,\' </p><p>Demirel said.  A "Milliyet" front page story claims that Al- </p><p>Qaida has been preparing since last November for attacks on </p><p>U.S. and Israeli targets in Turkey.  The Turkish police have </p><p>taken extraordinary security measures to protect foreign </p><p>missions and companies, papers report.  Dailies report that </p><p>Turkish villagers threw stones at a truck convoy carrying </p><p>U.S. military equipment from Mardin en route to Incirlik and </p><p>Iskenderun.  Justice Minister and government Spokesman Cemil </p><p>Cicek, an influential figure in the AKP cabinet, said on </p><p>Sunday that Turkey should not be blamed for the failure of </p><p>Americans in the operation.  `Turkey and the U.S. have </p><p>different priorities in Northern Iraq; we have no </p><p>imperialist goal in the region, and will intervene solely </p><p>for humanitarian reasons,\' Cicek said.  Reports note Ankara </p><p>is greatly concerned about the Kurdish peshmerges\' advance </p><p>on Kirkuk.  Sunday\'s reports say Khalilzad has convinced </p><p>Kurdish groups and the Turkomen to attend a meeting with </p><p>Turkey and the U.S. in Ankara or the Turkish border town of </p><p>Silopi next week.  Saturday\'s dailies say that `fear, pain, </p><p>and hatred\' reigns in Baghdad following a `second </p><p>marketplace killing\' by an unidentified missile.  The </p><p>missile attack claimed about 60 lives.  Papers report </p><p>growing fear among coalition soldiers after a suicide attack </p><p>in Najaf, in which four Americans were killed.  Coalition </p><p>soldiers have now started shooting at civilian targets </p><p>without warning, according to reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Court rejects release of DEP members: The State Security </p><p>Court (SSC) Friday refused to free four Kurdish Democracy </p><p>Party (DEP) parliamentarians jailed nine years ago. </p><p>European parliamentarians and human rights activists who </p><p>observed the hearing were disappointed by the verdict, </p><p>papers report.  Turkey was widely criticised for jailing the </p><p>four, who won an appeal to the European Court of Human </p><p>Rights.  The retrial could take many months.  Leyla Zana, </p><p>Hatip Dicle, Selim Sadak, and Orhan Dogan would not normally </p><p>be entitled to release for another two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did the US stumble?" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna opined in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(3/31): "The ongoing speculation about the US stumbling in </p><p>the Iraq war and dragging itself into a Vietnam-like </p><p>situation should be watched carefully.  Such rhetoric will </p><p>not do any good for Turkey or its relations with the US, </p><p>because this kind of propaganda stems from ideological </p><p>positions.  Turkish-American relations as well as the US </p><p>superpower role around the world should be taken seriously </p><p>and analyzed free of ideological dogma.  Otherwise, it will </p><p>only distance Turkey further from being a member of the </p><p>contemporary civilized club.  . However, it is true to a </p><p>certain extent that the US has made some tactical mistakes </p><p>in its war strategy.  It does not matter really at this </p><p>point whether the White House or the Pentagon is to blame. </p><p>But the fact of the matter is that the US apparently began </p><p>the operation without having enough military build-up." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The miscalculation" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (3/31): "The </p><p>coalition force has started to admit that the war is not </p><p>moving as it was planned.  Even President Bush accepts the </p><p>fact that it might take longer than the 2 or 3 weeks to </p><p>finish the job. . In spite all the negative factors and </p><p>delays, the overall conviction is that the US will win the </p><p>war in the end.  Even France agrees with this.  . It is also </p><p>true that the war will take weeks, and maybe months. In </p><p>other words, there will be more blood and more tears. </p><p>Moreover, it remains to be seen how the different resistance </p><p>tactics by Saddam\'s regime will be countered by the </p><p>coalition\'s undeniably superior military and technological </p><p>power.  Even when the tide turns in favor of the coalition\'s </p><p>forces, we should still not expect a swift ending.  It seems </p><p>that winning people\'s hearts will be harder than winning the </p><p>war itself, and will take much more time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
