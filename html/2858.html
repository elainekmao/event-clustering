<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: EDITORIAL MARKS PRESS FREEDOM DAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Facts are sacred, comment is free" </p><p>   the independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" </p><p>   dedicated its May 3 editorial to encouraging the media </p><p>   in Zimbabwe, especially the privately owned press, to </p><p>   "start showing zero tolerance to perverted journalism." </p><p>   The editorial, appearing on World Press Freedom Day, </p><p>   comes as the Government of Zimbabwe is actively </p><p>   threatening the independent press. Editorial excerpts </p><p>   follow: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .Journalists anywhere in the world walk a </p><p>   minefield of truths, half-truths, deceit and lies </p><p>   and yet it is their absolute professional duty at </p><p>   all times to check and counter-check the </p><p>   information given to them by whomever before they </p><p>   cobble up a story.  Although mistakes may occur if </p><p>   only because journalists are human, these must be </p><p>   rare and defensible - morally and legally - not </p><p>   that this makes them any better.  The bigger the </p><p>   story, the greater the need for any journalist to </p><p>   take extraordinary measures to verify it with all </p><p>   possible sources before rushing to be the first </p><p>   with the news.  In Zimbabwe, journalists face a </p><p>   particularly harsh operating climate.  They have to </p><p>   contend with an unpopular government which loathes </p><p>   the media\'s prying eyes and has enacted draconian </p><p>   laws specifically targeting the independent media. </p><p>   . . .But the forces ranged against Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>   independent media are not just overzealous state </p><p>   mandarins eager to protect their jobs, but many </p><p>   other equally powerful organized interest groups </p><p>   which similarly feel uncomfortable with the </p><p>   coverage of what they regard as negative news.  It </p><p>   thus becomes imperative that all journalists get </p><p>   their act together by ensuring that all their news </p><p>   dispatches are as accurate, balanced and fair as is </p><p>   humanly possible. . .  Any news report which fails </p><p>   this test can only play into the hands of the </p><p>   forces which seek to muzzle the media for whatever </p><p>   reason under the guise of the public or national </p><p>   interest, or of national security, or of national </p><p>   defense. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
