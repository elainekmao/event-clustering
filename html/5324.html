<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000158 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MONEY LAUNDERING SECTION OF 2002 INCSR </p><p> </p><p>The following is Post\'s submission of the Nigeria section </p><p>of the 2002 INCSR Money Laundering Chapter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Republic of Nigeria is Africa\'s largest </p><p>democracy. It is a hub of money laundering and criminal </p><p>activity not only for the West African sub-region but also </p><p>increasingly for the entire continent. Nigerian trafficking </p><p>and money laundering organizations have proven adept at </p><p>devising new ways of subverting law enforcement efforts, </p><p>and evading detection. Their success in avoiding detection </p><p>and prosecution has led to an increase in financial crimes </p><p>of all types, including bank fraud, advance fee fraud, and </p><p>money laundering. Despite the determined efforts of the new </p><p>government to counter years of rampant corruption, crime </p><p>continues to plague Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud is one of the most lucrative </p><p>financial crimes committed by Nigerians. Conservative </p><p>estimates indicate hundreds of millions of dollars in </p><p>illicit profits generated annually. This type of fraud is </p><p>referred to internationally as "Four-One-Nine-Scams," (419 </p><p>is the Nigerians criminal code\'s section on fraud). The </p><p>gist of a "419" scam is to trick victims by persuading them </p><p>that they will receive an exorbitant return for providing a </p><p>relatively modest payment of a fictitious fee in advance. </p><p>Businesses and individuals around the world have been and </p><p>continue to be targeted by these "get rich quick" offers. </p><p>These scams often go beyond confidence games; violence </p><p>against the fraud victims has also occurred.  Substantial </p><p>evidence exists that narcotics traffickers have utilized </p><p>419 Scams to fund their illicit smuggling efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in June 2001 and in </p><p>June 2002 designated Nigeria as a Non-Cooperating Country </p><p>or Territory for failing to improve its money laundering </p><p>controls and failing to cooperate with repeated FATF </p><p>requests for information.  In October 2002, FATF gave </p><p>Nigeria  a deadline of December 15, 2002 to adopt necessary </p><p>anti-money laundering legislation or face "counter- </p><p>measures" by FATF members.  Although proposed legislation </p><p>had been held up  in the National Assembly, the GON worked </p><p>energetically in the last months of 2002 to pass </p><p>legislative reforms.  The National Assembly, meeting in </p><p>emergency session on December 14, 2002, passed three key </p><p>pieces of anti-money laundering legislation:  an amendment </p><p>to the 1995 Money Laundering Act, that extends the scope of </p><p>the law\'s coverage beyond the proceeds of drug trafficking </p><p>to the proceeds of all crimes; an amendment to the 1991 </p><p>Banking and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Act that </p><p>expands coverage of the law to stock brokerage firms and </p><p>foreign currency exchange facilities and gives the Central </p><p>Bank of Nigeria greater power to deny banks licenses and to </p><p>freeze suspicious accounts; and the new Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission Act that creates a central law enforcement body </p><p>to coordinate anti-money laundering operations and </p><p>information sharing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and the </p><p>Money Laundering Surveillance Unit (MLSU) of the Central </p><p>Bank of Nigeria will continue to play a role in fighting </p><p>money laundering, but they will no longer have the lead </p><p>roles -- that role will fall to the new Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission.   Under the new legislation passed on December </p><p>14, 2002, financial institutions are required to report </p><p>cash transactions that exceed N1,000, 000 (U.S. $8,800) for </p><p>an individual and N5 million (U.S. $45,000) for corporate </p><p>bodies.  Identification of customers is required when a </p><p>transaction exceeds the threshold amount of U.S. $10,000 or </p><p>its equivalent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In passing these laws, Nigeria met the FATF\'s immediate </p><p>demand (the December 15, 2002 deadline) of expanded </p><p>coverage of its money laundering laws beyond narcotics </p><p>trafficking and making financial institutions\' reporting </p><p>requirements more effective.  The additional legislation -- </p><p>extending coverage of anti-money laws to other financial </p><p>institutions, providing the Central Bank of Nigeria with </p><p>the powers to freeze suspicious accounts and deny licenses </p><p>to banks suspected of money laundering, and creating a </p><p>central coordinating body and financial intelligence unit - </p><p>- go a long way toward bringing Nigeria\'s money laundering </p><p>control regime into conformity with international </p><p>standards.  Nigeria is well positioned to continue its </p><p>dialogue with the FATF towards the goal of ending its </p><p>designation as a Non-Cooperating Country or Territory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Creation, staffing and the operations of the new Financial </p><p>Crimes Commission will be critical to the effectiveness of </p><p>the new laws.  The Commission should second experienced </p><p>staff from various law enforcement agencies; it should also </p><p>build up its own cadre of professional investigators.  We </p><p>encourage the Government of Nigeria to fund adequately this </p><p>important new Commission and we hope to provide the </p><p>Commission\'s new staff technical assistance and training. </p><p>With trained staff and adequate operational funding, the </p><p>new Commission can begin to obtain court convictions on </p><p>money laundering cases it investigates, a much needed </p><p>departure from the past lack of money laundering </p><p>convictions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Act was </p><p>signed into law in June of 2000. The Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices Commission was established to enforce the newly </p><p>enacted law and granted powers of investigation, arrest and </p><p>prosecution.  The Commission\'s first public trials began in </p><p>May 2001. Nigeria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention </p><p>and in June 2001 provided notification that it had ratified </p><p>and the 2000 UN Convention against Transnational Crime, </p><p>which is not yet in force internationally. The United </p><p>States and Nigeria signed an MLAT in 1989, which was </p><p>ratified by the United States in 2001, and is currently </p><p>pending approval by the Nigerian Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(end). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
