<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 005404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, VT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  HOLY SEE NOMINATES NEW VATICAN PERMANENT OBSERVER </p><p>TO THE U.N.: BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON CELESTINO MIGLIORE </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) VATICAN 4398,  B) VATICAN 4388 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED UNDERSECRETARY FOR </p><p>RELATIONS WITH STATES (DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER) MONSIGNOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05404  060634Z </p><p>CELESTINO MIGLIORE TO BE THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER </p><p>AT THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK.  MIGLIORE REPLACES </p><p>ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO WHO RETURNS TO ROME TO TAKE UP A </p><p>SENIOR CURIA POSITION.  MIGLIORE WILL BE ORDAINED AS AN </p><p>ARCHBISHOP BEFORE TAKING UP HIS POSTING TO NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) CELESTINO MIGLIORE WAS BORN IN CUNEO, IN PIEDMONT </p><p>PROVINCE, IN THE NORTH OF ITALY IN 1950.  AFTER HIS </p><p>ORDINATION AS A CATHOLIC PRIEST HE TOOK UP GRADUATE STUDIES </p><p>IN CANON LAW AND DIPLOMACY AND ENTERED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN 1980.  MIGLIORE SERVED AT HOLY SEE </p><p>NUNCIATURES IN ANGOLA, THE U.S., EGYPT, AND POLAND. IN 1992 </p><p>HE WAS APPOINTED AS THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN STRASBOURG.  HE RETURNED TO ROME IN </p><p>1995 UPON HIS APPOINTMENT AS UNDERSECRETARY OF THE SECTION </p><p>FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES (AT THE VATICAN\'S SECRETARIAT OF </p><p>STARE. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH AND </p><p>PORTUGUESE. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) MIGLIORE HAS BEEN ONE OF POST\'S MOST OPEN, </p><p>ARTICULATE, AND FRIENDLY INTERLOCUTORS.  MORE SO THAN MANY </p><p>OTHER VATICAN OFFICIALS, HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO ACT TO </p><p>RESOLVE PROBLEMS OR ADVANCE POLICY, SOMETIMES DEFYING THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S TRADITIONAL CAUTION.  HE WAS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>INSTANTLY AND POSITIVELY DISPOSED TO WORKING WITH POST AND </p><p>OTHER DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO ORGANIZE AND HOST AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS WHEN </p><p>OTHERS IN THE HOLY SEE WERE MORE HESITANT.  THIS "CAN DO" </p><p>ATTITUDE SHOULD STAND HIM WELL IN HIS UPCOMING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE U.N.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT MIGLIORE THINKS LIKE AN AMERICAN.  HE IS ITALIAN, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05404  060634Z </p><p>SEES THE WORLD THROUGH A EUROPEAN FILTER, WHICH HAS LED HIM </p><p>AT TIMES TO BE CRITICAL OF OR SKEPTICAL TOWARD ASPECTS OF </p><p>U.S. POLICIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN AN EARLY OCTOBER 2001 </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH POLOFF ABOUT THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, MIGLIORE POINTEDLY NOTED THAT </p><p>"AFTER ALL, BIN LADEN IS A U.S. CREATION" (NOTE: REFERRING </p><p>TO U.S. ASSISTANCE TO ISLAMIC MUJAHADIN IN AFGHANISTAN IN </p><p>THE 1980\'S.)  LIKEWISE, IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BIOTECH FOODS, </p><p>HE HAS ASSERTED THE VIEW THAT U.S. POLICY IN ZAMBIA IS </p><p>DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC, RATHER THAN HUMANITARIAN, INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MIGLIORE\'S VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST ARE </p><p>REPORTED IN DETAIL IN REFTELS.  MIGLIORE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT </p><p>HE IS "NO FAN OF IRAQ," BUT DOES NOT YET BELIEVE THE U.S. </p><p>HAS YET MADE THE CASE FOR PREEMPTIVE MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  MIGLIORE, AS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER EQUIVALENT AT </p><p>THE VATICAN, NECESSARILY COVERED A GLOBAL RANGE OF FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY ISSUES.  WHETHER BY CHOICE OR CIRCUMSTANCE, IN THE </p><p>LAST YEAR HE HAS TAKEN A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN A FEW AREAS: </p><p>THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN NORTH KOREA (HE HAS TRAVELED </p><p>THERE FIVE TIMES IN RECENT YEARS), THE CHURCH\'S POSITION IN </p><p>RUSSIA WHERE HE RECENTLY TRAVELED TO DISCUSS GOR\'S REFUSAL </p><p>OF VISAS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY, AND THE CHURCH\'S DIFFICULT </p><p>RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM.  ALL IN ALL, MIGLIORE CAN BE COUNTED </p><p>ON TO BE AN OPEN, SOMETIMES UNVARNISHED, BUT ALSO CAREFUL </p><p>AND DELIBERATE INTERLOCUTOR AT THE U.N.  HE CERTAINLY ENJOYS </p><p>THE CONFIDENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN AND THE POPE </p><p>HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  ARCHBISHOP-DESIGNATE MIGLIORE WILL STEP INTO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05404  060634Z </p><p>SHOES OF THE ABLE RENATO MARTINO, THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AT THE U.N. FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. IT WAS </p><p>MARTINO\'S LEADERSHIP THAT STEERED THE HOLY SEE DELEGATIONS </p><p>TO SELF-PROCLAIMED SUCCESS AT U.N. CONFERENCES IN RIO DE </p><p>JANEIRO IN 1992, CAIRO IN 1994, BEIJING IN 1995 AND THE MORE </p><p>RECENT 2002 CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. MARTINO\'S 40 YEARS IN THE </p><p>SERVICE OF VATICAN DIPLOMACY, IN PLACES AS FAR APART AS </p><p>SINGAPORE AND LEBANON, PROVIDED HIM WITH A UNIQUE </p><p>PREPARATION FOR HIS TIME AT THE U.N.  MARTINO WAS CONSTANTLY </p><p>IN THE NEWS, BOTH SECULAR AND ECCLESIASTICAL. HE ALSO SPENT </p><p>A GREAT DEAL OF TIME PROMOTING THE HOLY SEE\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>INITIATIVES AT THE U.N. DURING VISITS ABROAD. IN FACT, </p><p>ARCHBISHOP MARTINO\'S EFFORTS HAVE TURNED THE PERMANENT </p><p>OBSERVER POST INTO A KEY VENUE FOR THE HOLY SEE TO PROJECT </p><p>ITS MESSAGE.  MIGLIORE INHERITS THE PRESTIGE, BUT ALSO THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE POST.  THE FACT THAT POPE JOHN PAUL </p><p>CHOSE MIGLIORE TO BE THE HOLY SEE\' PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE </p><p>U.N. SHOWS THE HOLY SEE WANTS ITS BEST DIPLOMATIC HAND </p><p>PLAYED AT THIS KEY INTERNATIONAL TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05404 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
