(U) ON AUGUST 9 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH MADE HIS SECOND </p><p>VISIT TO  "SECTOR NORTH" SINCE THE CROATIAN MILITARY </p><p>ACTION.  ONE OF HIS STOPS WAS GLINA, WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO </p><p>OBSERVE THE DESTRUCTION THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING RECENT </p><p>FIGHTING, SPEAK TO A FEW CROATIAN RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN, </p><p>AND DISCUSS THE FUTURE WITH CROATIAN AUTHORITIES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>OLD DESTRUCTION AND NEW </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR AND A NUMBER OF EMBASSY PERSONNEL </p><p>TRAVELLED TO THE TOWN OF GLINA IN SECTOR NORTH ON AUGUST </p><p>9.  ON THE WAY, AFTER CROSSING WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN </p><p>THE CONFRONTATION LINE, THE EMBASSY VEHICLES PASSED </p><p>THROUGH A SURREAL LANDSCAPE OF DEVASTATED HOUSES AND </p><p>SHATTERED STOREFRONTS THAT LOOKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE SET </p><p>OF THE OLD "COMBAT" TELEVISION SERIES.  EVERY FEW MILES, </p><p>GROUPS OF SOLDIERS COULD BE SEEN LOUNGING INSIDE BOMBED </p><p>OUT BUILDINGS, SHELTERING THEMSELVES FROM THE RAIN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) JUDGING FROM THE GROWTH OF VEGETATION, MOST OF THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION ALONG THE ROAD HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THE \'91 </p><p>WAR.  IN GLINA, HOWEVER, FRESH SCARS FROM MORTAR SHELLS </p><p>AND MACHINE GUN FIRE COULD BE SEEN ON MANY BUILDINGS. </p><p>MOST STRUCTURES WERE INTACT, HOWEVER, AND THERE WERE NO </p><p>SIGNS OF THE FIRE BOMBING THAT HAD BEEN SO PREVALENT ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES DURING THE CONFLICT OF FOUR YEARS AGO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03045  01 OF 03  101510Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE SHOW WINDOWS OF MOST STOREFRONTS HAD BEEN </p><p>SHATTERED AND MUCH OF THE MERCHANDISE (THOUGH BY NO MEANS </p><p>ALL) HAD BEEN LOOTED.  WHETHER THIS HAD OCCURRED AS THE </p><p>RESIDENTS WERE DEPARTING AND GRABBING WHAT THEY COULD, OR </p><p>WHEN THE CROATIAN FORCES FIRST ARRIVED, WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>TELL.  THERE WAS CLEARLY NO LOOTING GOING ON WHILE WE WERE </p><p>THERE AND THE CROATIAN MILITARY AND POLICE APPEARED </p><p>DISCIPLINED AND WELL-ORGANIZED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) AT THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE/POST OFFICE, A FEW </p><p>PEOPLE HAD BEGUN SWEEPING UP THE SHATTERED GLASS WHICH </p><p>COVERED THE FLOOR.  WATER DRIPPED IN THROUGH A GAPING </p><p>SHELL HOLE IN THE ROOF.  REPAIRMEN FROM THE CROATIAN </p><p>TELEPHONE COMPANY SAID THE LOCAL PHONE SYSTEM WOULD BE UP </p><p>AND RUNNING THE FOLLOWING DAY AND THE TOWN SHOULD BE </p><p>HOOKED UP TO THE NATIONAL GRID SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS, ALL "RSK" COMMUNICATION LINES HAD </p><p>RUN THROUGH BELGRADE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>FIRST THE CROATS AND NOW THE SERBS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THE TOWN HAD AN EERIE FEEL ABOUT IT, AS ITS </p><p>INHABITANTS HAD APPARENTLY GOTTEN UP AND LEFT IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE OF WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING.  CLOTHES WERE STILL </p><p>HUNG ON THE LINE TO DRY.  ICECREAM WAS MELTING IN </p><p>FREEZERS.  FRESH MEAT COULD BE SEEN SPOILING IN THE </p><p>BUTCHER SHOPS.  (NOTE:  ELECTRIC COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID </p><p>POWER WOULD BE RESTORED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS).  IN A TV </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03045  01 OF 03  101510Z </p><p>REPAIR SHOP A SET WAS DISMANTLED ON THE WORKBENCH.  OTHER </p><p>SETS LINED THE WALLS.  A SMALL DOG WAS COWERING UNDER A </p><p>CHAIR, VAINLY AWAITING THE RETURN OF HIS MASTER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) SOLDIERS ACCOUNTED FOR 90 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE TO </p><p>BE SEEN ON THE STREETS.  THE TOWN\'S POPULATION WAS 6,933 </p><p>IN THE 1991 CENSUS.  VIRTUALLY ALL OF GLINA\'S CROATS, </p><p>(ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION), WERE ETHNICALLY </p><p>CLEANSED DURING THE \'91 WAR.  NOW ITS SERBIAN RESIDENTS </p><p>HAD FLED AS WELL, PANICKED BY THE ADVANCE OF CROATIAN </p><p>TROOPS, LEAVING THE BULK OF THEIR POSSESSIONS BEHIND. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR ENCOUNTERED NO SERBS IN GLINA, BUT </p><p>AMONG THE FEW CIVILIANS WANDERING ABOUT WERE A PAIR OF </p><p>CROATIAN WOMEN.  THEY HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO STAY ON AFTER </p><p>THEIR FELLOW CROATS HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE FOUR YEARS </p><p>AGO.  THE ONE WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR SPOKE WAS A MIDWIFE </p><p>WHOSE SKILLS WERE PERHAPS NEEDED.  SHE HAD NO COMPLAINTS </p><p>REGARDING HER TREATMENT BY THE SERBS.  SHE SAID THAT SHE </p><p>ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD EVENTUALLY </p><p>RETURN TO THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ9345 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9345 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03045  02 OF 03  101510Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  EB-01 </p><p>      OIGO-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-06    L-01     ADS-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00 </p><p>      PRM-10   PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00       /039W </p><p>                  ------------------E21E6F  101511Z /38 </p><p>P 101611Z AUG 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6837 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 003045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PREF, MOPS, HR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03045  02 OF 03  101510Z </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE NO. 21:  GLINA BECOMES A GHOST TOWN </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>A PRIEST RETURNS TO HIS PARISH </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) WE HAD A CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH THE LOCAL CATHOLIC </p><p>PRIEST, RETURNED TO HIS PARISH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE </p><p>BEING FORCED TO LEAVE ON JULY 14, 1991.  AS HE WANDERED </p><p>THROUGH THE ROOMS OF HIS FORMER RECTORY, HE POINTED OUT </p><p>ITEMS THAT HAD APPEARED SINCE HE HAD LEFT; A POSTER OF THE </p><p>BELGRADE "RED STAR" SOCCER TEAM, A PICTURE OF SERBIAN </p><p>LEADER SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) A FAMILY HAD CLEARLY BEEN LIVING IN THE HOUSE UP </p><p>TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE.  THE GARDEN WAS PLANTED WITH </p><p>VEGETABLES.  CHILDREN\'S TOYS LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR. </p><p>A HALF EATEN BOX OF COOKIES WAS ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER. </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE PLACE HAD BEEN INHABITED PROBABLY </p><p>EXPLAINS WHY IT HAD BEEN SPARED THE FATE OF MOST CROAT- </p><p>OWNED BUILDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ACROSS THE PARK HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>SO LUCKY.  IN WHAT AT FIRST GLANCE APPEARED TO BE AN EMPTY </p><p>LOT, THE OUTLINES OF THE CHURCH\'S FOUNDATION COULD JUST </p><p>BARELY BE MADE OUT.  EXCEPT FOR THE TWISTED REMAINS OF A </p><p>WROUGHT IRON GATE, NOTHING ELSE REMAINED, INCLUDING AN </p><p>ALTAR WHICH HAD BEEN SALVAGED FROM THE ZAGREB CATHEDRAL </p><p>AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE LAST CENTURY.  THE PARISH </p><p>PRIEST SAID HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MINISTERED TO A CONGREGATION </p><p>OF 2.500 PEOPLE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03045  02 OF 03  101510Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN THE STREET, AT THE ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH A SHELL HAD LANDED NEARBY AND BLASTED A HOLE </p><p>THROUGH THE WALL SHATTERING SOME OF THE WINDOWS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE ALTAR AND ICONOSTASIS REMAINED UNDAMAGED.  THERE WERE </p><p>NO SIGNS OF VANDALISM.  A CROATIAN POLICEMAN WAS STATIONED </p><p>OUT FRONT TO PREVENT LOOTING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>"WE WILL NOT TREAT THEM AS THEY HAVE TREATED US" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS ORIGINALLY FROM </p><p>THE GLINA AREA.  THEY SAID A MAJORITY OF THE SOLDIERS WE </p><p>SAW WERE FROM THE AREA AND THEY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>REMAIN NOW THAT THE TOWN HAD BEEN RETAKEN.  THE HOUSE OF </p><p>ONE HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  THE HOUSE OF THE OTHER WAS STILL </p><p>INTACT BECAUSE, HE SAID, A SERBIAN FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING </p><p>THERE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) IN TALKING TO US THEY EMPHASIZED THAT SERB </p><p>PROPERTY WOULD NOT BE DESTROYED AND SERBS WHO HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES OR ETHNIC CLEANSING WERE WELCOME TO </p><p>RETURN.  "WE ARE A CIVILIZED, WESTERN SOCIETY," THEY </p><p>INSISTED.  "WE WILL NOT TREAT THEM AS THEY HAVE TREATED </p><p>US." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03045  02 OF 03  101510Z </p><p>15.  (C) THE WAY THE POLICEMEN SPOKE GAVE THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT THEY HAD TAKEN SOME PAINS TO LEARN THE "PARTY LINE." </p><p>CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN SISAK WHERE, REPORTEDLY, </p><p>THE PEOPLE HURLED BRICKS AND INSULTS AT DEPARTING SERBS </p><p>AND THE POLICE STOOD BY AND DID NOTHING TO PREVENT IT. </p><p>(NOTE:  THE AMBASSADOR IS TRAVELLING TO SISAK AUGUST 10 TO </p><p>OBSERVE, AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT, FURTHER SUCH INCIDENTS.) </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) IT WAS PREDICTED THAT MOST SERBS WOULD FLEE THE </p><p>KRAJINA IF CROATIA TOOK MILITARY ACTION.  FROM WHAT WE </p><p>HAVE HEARD AND OBSERVED IN PLACES LIKE PETRINJA, KNIN, AND </p><p>GLINA, THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE EVIDENCE OF ATROCITIES </p><p>OR PEOPLE BEING FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES BY CROATIAN </p><p>FORCES.  MORE TYPICALLY THEY FLED BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF </p><p>CROATIAN TROOPS OR WERE ORDERED TO LEAVE BY "RSK" </p><p>AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) HOWEVER, THE FOCUS WILL NOW TURN TO WHETHER THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT CREATES THE CONDITIONS THAT WILL </p><p>ENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMES. </p><p>HUMANE TREATMENT OF SERBS WHO REMAINED BEHIND, CARE AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF SERB PROPERTY, AND ALLOWING FOR A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ9346 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9346 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03045  03 OF 03  101511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  EB-01 </p><p>      OIGO-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-06    L-01     ADS-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00 </p><p>      PRM-10   PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00       /039W </p><p>                  ------------------E21E72  101511Z /38 </p><p>P 101611Z AUG 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6838 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 003045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PREF, MOPS, HR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03045  03 OF 03  101511Z </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE NO. 21:  GLINA BECOMES A GHOST TOWN </p><p> </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL AUTONOMY IN </p><p>SERB MAJORITY AREAS WILL BE CRITICAL IN THIS REGARD. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE EXAMPLE OF FORMER SECTOR WEST AND THE </p><p>INCIDENT IN SISAK ARE NOT LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE MANY OF </p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT TO RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
