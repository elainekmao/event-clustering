<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR (D) ARMITAGE, (P) GROSSMAN, (EUR) JONES </p><p>NSC FOR HADLEY, FRIED </p><p>OVP FOR EDELMAN </p><p>OSD FOR WOLFOWITZ, FEITH </p><p>JCS FOR CJCS MYERS, VJCS PACE, J-5 CASEY </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PARLIAMENTARY VOTE POST-MORTEM </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  MFA U/S told the Ambassador March 1 the </p><p>Turkish system was in shock following defeat of the </p><p>Parliamentary resolution for U.S. and Turkish Troop </p><p>Deployments.  The PM and Government worked hard to convince </p><p>parliamentarians, but felt their efforts were not fully </p><p>understood.  Turkey remains committed to the strategic </p><p>partnership with the U.S. and is ready to work on a broad </p><p>range of issues.  How the Government will pull itself </p><p>together and how it will proceed on the Iraq issue remains an </p><p>open question at this point.  Ziyal asked for supportive U.S. </p><p>statements to help control potential market fallout and a </p><p>provocative Kurdish reaction.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Following failure of the Parliamentary vote on troop </p><p>deployments March 1, MFA Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal provided </p><p>the Ambassador with an evaluation of the situation.  Working </p><p>from a prepared text, Ziyal noted that the result left the </p><p>Government, the AK party and the bureaucracy in shock.  The </p><p>Parliament had engaged in a long and heated debate.  The </p><p>Government did everything possible to persuade Parliament to </p><p>vote in favor.  While the Government obtained a simple </p><p>majority in favor, it did not meet the constitutional </p><p>requirement for a majority of the sitting members, failing by </p><p>3 votes (264 yes votes, with 267 of the 533 voting required </p><p>to pass).  The Government told the Parliament that all of the </p><p>MOU,s (Military, Economic and Political) were in place, even </p><p>though we were still just short of full agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ziyal said that the Government had informed the U.S. </p><p>of the difficulties facing it in obtaining Parliamentary </p><p>approval all along the way.  Washington had not understood </p><p>the difficulty.  While the Prime Minister needed time to </p><p>prepare the ground, the delays were seen as procrastination. </p><p>Although officials understood the U.S. need for an early </p><p>response to its requests, the public viewed the U.S. approach </p><p>as putting Turkey under pressure.  Turkey tried to prepare </p><p>agreements in political, military and economic areas to </p><p>persuade Parliament of the benefit of cooperation, but the </p><p>process as seen as bargaining.  Turkey asked the right spin </p><p>be given to the U.S. press, instead Turkey,s difficulties </p><p>were met by mockery.  Last but not least Turkomen were left </p><p>off the presidium committee formed by the Iraqi opposition </p><p>conference almost on the day of the Parliamentary discussion. </p><p> This issue was directly raised during the Parliament debate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ziyal noted that the Prime Minister and the </p><p>Government had risked their political future to stand by </p><p>American Friendship.  The AK party would meet Sunday morning, </p><p>he said, to evaluate the result and determine how the </p><p>Government would proceed.  Despite the failure of the </p><p>resolution, Turkey,s commitment to the strategic partnership </p><p>continued, and he hoped the U.S. would recognize and value </p><p>the effort as well as the continuing value of our strategic </p><p>partnership.  Our relationship, Ziyal added is not about just </p><p>one issue, but about the many that we pursue together. </p><p>Turkey is ready to work on with the U.S. on all issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ziyal noted that in the immediate aftermath of the </p><p>vote, he had two major concerns.  First was the reaction of </p><p>the financial markets on Monday, and second was the reaction </p><p>of the Iraqi Kurds.  He said the calm reaction from the </p><p>Embassy in the immediate aftermath of the vote was helpful </p><p>and that it is important for the U.S. more generally to </p><p>respond in a measured way to the developments in order to </p><p>limit the difficulties that could develop on those two </p><p>fronts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Ambassador responded that the U.S. appreciated </p><p>the Government\'s effort to work for a favorable decision.  He </p><p>noted that the relative majority of those who expressed an </p><p>opinion favored passage of the measure.  He said the U.S. </p><p>would need some practical information as it evaluated next </p><p>steps.  We would need to know as soon as possible whether the </p><p>Government would consider taking the issue back to </p><p>parliament, and in what form that might happen.  Following </p><p>the leadership meeting the Ambassador said we hoped the </p><p>Government would be able to give us an idea of the options </p><p>and time frames it was considering as soon as possible. </p><p>Ziyal answered that it was impossible to make any predictions </p><p>at this juncture, but that as the GOT began to evaluate its </p><p>course, it was extremely important to know what the U.S. was </p><p>thinking as well.  Ziyal agreed that it was important not to </p><p>take any actions that put the U.S. and Turkey immediately </p><p>into a particular bind, as we work forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Having failed to achieve a positive vote on the </p><p>Parliamentary resolution, the AK party will have to </p><p>reconsider its situation beginning tomorrow.  It will be </p><p>faced soon with what should be sobering reactions, from the </p><p>markets in particular, as Ziyal worries.  One way forward </p><p>could be for resubmission soon of a new resolution, but </p><p>conceivably not until after Erdogan\'s expected victory in the </p><p>Parliamentary by-election next Sunday (March 9) which could </p><p>help the party begin pulling itself back together. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
