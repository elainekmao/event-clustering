<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002445 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRIORITIES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 140035 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  In response to Reftel information request, the USG does </p><p>not currently have an environmental program in Nigeria, </p><p>although USD 2 million has now been identified for an </p><p>environmental program.  USAID/Nigeria ha prepared a scope of </p><p>work for an overall assessment of the environment in Nigeria. </p><p> The assessment team, comprised of USAID/Global officers and </p><p>private consultants, will likely be on the ground in November </p><p>2001 with the report completed by February 2002.  The Mission </p><p>believes that this assessment will identify many </p><p>opportunities for U.S. assistance to Nigeria in confronting </p><p>environmental problems.  Per reftel,s requests, the </p><p>Mission,s preliminary thoughts on priority areas for </p><p>environmental assistance are described here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Other international donors active in the environment in </p><p>Nigeria include the European Union, World Bank, UNDP, NORAD </p><p>and DFID.  There are also numerous local Non-Government </p><p>Organizations predominantly active in oil pollution </p><p>mitigation in the Niger Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Oil Pollution </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Nigeria derives 90 percent of its foreign exchange </p><p>earnings and 80 percent of government revenues from oil </p><p>exports.  The dominance of oil production in the economy has </p><p>lessened the focus on environmental degradation resulting </p><p>from oil sector activities.  But this degradation is great. </p><p>Oil spills occur almost weekly in the Delta, caused primarily </p><p>by smugglers and local communities who break into the </p><p>pipeline network to steal oil.  Moreover, the dredging of </p><p>canals to transport oil on barges to the Atlantic has </p><p>expanded the reach of oil spills, widening their area of </p><p>effect.  These canals have also allowed salt water from the </p><p>Atlantic to encroach inland, destroying freshwater animal and </p><p>plant life.  The impact of oil sector activities on coastal </p><p>areas is severe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The GON allocated N1.7 billion (roughly USD 14 million) in </p><p>both recurrent and capital expenditures to the Federal </p><p>Ministry of Environment in FY2001.  This allocation </p><p>represents only .2 percent of the total federal budget of </p><p>N894 billion (roughly USD 7.5 billion).  However, it appears </p><p>that the GON is increasing its focus on environmental </p><p>degradation, particularly in the area of oil pollution.  The </p><p>National Assembly, with support from the Federal Ministries </p><p>of Environment, Health, and Transport, held an Oil Pollution </p><p>Management Conference in August to raise the awareness of </p><p>environmental problems in the Niger Delta and to harmonize </p><p>the nation,s laws and regulations on oil pollution and its </p><p>mitigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The USG is also sponsoring several ad hoc activities </p><p>targeting specific energy/oil sector environmental problems. </p><p>First, USG agencies have identified USD 500,000 to be </p><p>targeted for pipeline safety and security.  Other activities </p><p>planned on an ad hoc basis include a Workshop on Removing </p><p>Lead from Gasoline for sometime this fall and an Oil Spill </p><p>Contingency Planning Workshop sponsored by the DOE/USAID in </p><p>January 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Another important oil-related issue is gas flaring, which </p><p>has contributed to acid rain and has had tremendous negative </p><p>impacts on agriculture and health in the Niger Delta.  The </p><p>Canadian mission in Nigeria is providing assistance to the </p><p>GON that helped lead the government to the decision to </p><p>eradicate gas flaring by 2008.  Three Liquified Natural Gas </p><p>(LNG) projects have been initiated in the South to utilize </p><p>flared gas as well as the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Renewable Energy </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Solar and hydroelectric power are two potential renewable </p><p>energy sources in Nigeria.  Currently, renewable energies are </p><p>primarily used for water pumps and irrigation, but their uses </p><p>could be even more widespread.  Some of the existing hydro </p><p>facilities are currently undergoing repair, and there are a </p><p>number of additional sites and existing dams that have been </p><p>surveyed as possible future hydro-electric power projects, </p><p>but there are no immediate plans for development.  Through </p><p>the Department of Energy and USAID, the U.S. Mission in </p><p>Nigeria has a resident energy advisor and a renewable energy </p><p>program.  This program aims to identify and remove existing </p><p>obstacles to creating a commercially viable renewable energy </p><p>industry in Nigeria.  Two workshops on renewable energy are </p><p>taking place in 2001 (one occurred in March and the other in </p><p>October), and a pilot solar power project will be initiated </p><p>in Jigawa State.  The focus of the November workshop will be </p><p>to draft a strategy for developing a commercially viable </p><p>renewable energy industry in Nigeria.  There are currently 37 </p><p>companies selling solar PV equipment in Nigeria, but there </p><p>are at present no fabricators or manufacturers of solar </p><p>equipment in the country.  The workshop will identify </p><p>barriers to the commercialization of renewable energy, such </p><p>as the high tariffs on PV panels and other renewable energy </p><p>components and subsidized fuel and energy prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Climate Change and Desertification </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. While not fully quantified, desertification is one of the </p><p>most pressing environmental problems in Nigeria.  It is </p><p>estimated that the country is losing approximately 351,000 </p><p>hectares of landmass to desert conditions annually. </p><p>Population pressure, compounded by the influx of migrants </p><p>from neighboring countries, and the grazing of live stock and </p><p>razing of all available wood is increasing the rate of land </p><p>loss.  Few alternative energy supplies are available and no </p><p>programs exist to provide these marginal populations with </p><p>power or gas for cooking.  Nigeria does have a few </p><p>federally-funded research centers that have developed energy </p><p>efficient cook stoves and solar powered ovens, but these new </p><p>technologies have not been distributed or effectively </p><p>marketed in the North.  Desertification in the north is also </p><p>aggravated by forest depletion in the middle and southern </p><p>regions of the country.  A long tradition of paper-making and </p><p>furniture building in these areas has led to a serious </p><p>depletion of forested areas.  Nigeria is one of 50 </p><p>participating countries within the UNFCC identifying sources </p><p>of greenhouse gasses and encouraging transfers of clean </p><p>technologies to developing countries.  A three day National </p><p>Workshop on the Clean Development Mechanism was held in Abuja </p><p>during the week of September 10-14. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Urban Areas and Waste Management </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Urban growth in Lagos is expected to lead to an </p><p>environmental disaster within the next 5-10 years. </p><p>Exponential population growth and the fact that much of </p><p>Lagos, located on islands, is sinking into the Atlantic </p><p>because of erosion and rising waters will need to be </p><p>addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Nigeria has substantial environmental pollution problems </p><p>resulting from industrial effluents, agricultural chemicals </p><p>and domestic sewage and waste.  In addition to untreated </p><p>sewage pollution, pollution from textile factories and </p><p>tanneries is commonly dumped in nearby rivers.  Lagos is the </p><p>only city in Nigeria that maintains a sewage treatment </p><p>facility, but even that is inadequate to keep up with the </p><p>growing population.  The Federal Ministry of Environment has </p><p>commissioned assessments to be undertaken in 12 urban areas </p><p>(Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano, Kaduna, Ibadan, </p><p>Maiduguri, Yola, Abeokute, Onitsha, Jos and Uyo Ilorin) to </p><p>design and assess the feasibility of community-based waste </p><p>management systems.  A pilot project for Community Waste </p><p>Minimization through source reduction, reuse, and recycling </p><p>has been initiated in a village suburb of Abuja.  Also, the </p><p>U.S. Trade and Development Agency recently signed a grant </p><p>agreement with the Imo-Abia Waste Management Commission to </p><p>conduct a feasibility study on a regional waste management </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Biodiversity and Wildlife Management </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. The continued loss of Nigeria\'s tropical forests and the </p><p>continued popularity and economic necessity of "bushmeat" as </p><p>a staple in people\'s diets have taken their toll on the </p><p>country\'s biodiversity resources.  In 1992, forests accounted </p><p>for only 9.61 percent of the total land area.  Nigeria has a </p><p>diverse collection of flora and fauna, including 274 species </p><p>of mammals, 830 species of birds and 5,081 plant species. </p><p>Out of the animal species, .14 percent are threatened and .22 </p><p>percent are endangered.  Of the mammals, two primates are </p><p>endangered: the white-throated guenon and Sclater\'s guenon. </p><p>Anti-poaching laws exist, but there is little enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. The World Wildlife Fund,s effort in South Africa to </p><p>redirect efforts from killing wildlife and game towards </p><p>benefiting from tourism generated by wildlife parks and </p><p>recreation has been very successful and could perhaps be </p><p>repeated in Nigeria.  The Savannah Conservation group, part </p><p>of the Ford Foundation, is working to encourage residents </p><p>surrounding the Yankari Game Park Reserve to not intrude on </p><p>the park to poach game.  The group is also implementing a </p><p>loan program to assist these communities. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
