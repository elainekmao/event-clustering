(C) - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  SOLOMON, PIAK, AND GRIFFITHS THANKED SDC SNC MEMBER HOR </p><p>NAMHONG FOR SOC COOPERATION OF THE POW/MIA ISSUE.  SOLOMON </p><p>STRESSED TO HOR NAMHONG THE NEED FOR ALL THE FACTIONS TO ABIDE </p><p>BY THE COMMITMENTS IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT TO ENSURE THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE HAD NO EXCUSES FOR NOT COOPERATING THEMSELVES.  SOLOMON </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT POLITICAL RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED AND THERE </p><p>MUST BE AN END TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  SIV REINFORCES THIS </p><p>POINT, UNDERLINING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS EXTEND BEYOND POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS ISSUES TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, </p><p>AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION, AMONG OTHERS.  HOR NAMHONG LISTED </p><p>SOC CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND PLEDGING FULL COOPERATION </p><p>BY THE SOC.  HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COULD BE "OVER-USED," RESULTING IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  WHILE </p><p>SOLOMON PRESSED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION OF FACTIONAL </p><p>FORCES, HOR NAMHONG SUGGESTED REVISITING THE QUESTION AFTER 10 </p><p>PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A/S SOLOMON HELD A ONE-HOUR MEETING WITH SOC SNC MEMBER AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HOR NAMHONG MARCH 9 IN PHNOM PENH.  DR. </p><p>SOLOMON\'S DELEGATION INCLUDED COM TWINING, WHITE SHOUSE SPECIAL </p><p>ASSISTANT SICHAN SIV, DOD DAS ALAN PTAK, NATIONAL LEAGUE OF </p><p>FAMILIES PRESIDENT ANNE MILLS GRIFFTHS, EAP/VLC DIRECTOR CHRIS </p><p>LA FLEUR, AND OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  HOR NAMHONG THANKED DR. SOLOMON FOR THE VISIT AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR THE LIFTING OF THE U.S. EMBARGO AGAINST </p><p>CAMBODIA.  RECALLING THE MEETING HE HAD HELD WITH DAS QUINN IN </p><p>WASHINGTON, HE PROMISED THAT THE SOC WOULD CONTINUE FULL </p><p>COOPERATION ON THE POW/MIA ISSUE, WHICH HE SAID THE SOC SEES AS </p><p>A PURELY HUMANITARIAN QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>GOC CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCORD </p><p>------ ------------ --------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  HOR NAMHONG PLEDGED FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS PEACE </p><p>AGREEMENT BY THE SOC.  HE THEN ENUMERATED SOC CONCERNS.  FIRST, </p><p>HE SAID THE 70 PERSENT DEMOBILIZATION OF FACTIONAL FORCES MUST </p><p>BE CARRIED OUT BEFORE THE RAINY SEASON BOGS DOWN TRANSPORTATION </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY.  SECOND, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT SOMETHING BE </p><p>DONE TO FIND WORK FOR THE DEMOBILIZED SOLDIRES.  IF THEY WERE </p><p>LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, THEY MIGHT BECOME INVOLVED IN </p><p>"MISCONDUCT."  THIRD, ON REPATRIATION, HOR NAMHONG CITED THE </p><p>INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF DEMINED LAND FOR THE RETURNEES.  HE </p><p>WORRIED THAT DELAY OF THE RETURN OF PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER </p><p>COULD PROLONG THE TRANSITION PERIOD, WITH BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCORD.  FOURTH, THE SOC SNC MEMBER </p><p>CITED POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH CORRUPTION AND VOTE BUYING IN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>"MUST NOT SEE AND OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS" </p><p>-------- --------------- ---------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  FIFTH, HOR NAMHONG ASSERTED THAT, WHILE ALL SIDES HAD </p><p>COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO IMPLEMENTING PLURALISM AND LIBERAL </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND FREEING ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS AT THE JANUARY 14 </p><p>SNC MEETING, ONLY THE SOC HAD DONE SO.  HOR NAMHONG WORRIED </p><p>THAT, "FREEDOMS WILL BE EXPLOITED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.... WE </p><p>MUST NOT SEE AN OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE SOC SNC MEMBER ALSO SAID IT REMAINED UNCLEAR THAT THE </p><p>KR WILL VOLUNTARILY ABIDE BY THE ACCORDS.  HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>SHOOTING OF THE UN HELICOPTER AND CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS IN </p><p>KOMPONG THOM AS EVIDENCE THE KR MAY NOT COOPERATE.  FURTHER, </p><p>HOR NAMHONG SPECULATED THE KR MIGHT NOT RESPECT THE RESULTS OF </p><p>FUTURE ELECTIONS.  HE ARGUED, "FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>ACCORD WILL NOT MEAN THE END OF THE KR THREAT."  HE AVERRED </p><p>THAT KR STRATEGY IS NOT TO WIN ELECTIONS NOW, BUT TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>THEIR POSITION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. GRATITUDE ON POW.MIA ISSUE </p><p>------------- ----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  A/S SOLOMON, RESPONDED BY THANKING HOR NAMHONG ESPECIALLY </p><p>FOR THE COOPERATION THE U.S. HAS RECEIVED ON POW/MIA.  DAS PTAK </p><p>AND MRS. GRIFFITHS ALSO EXPRESED GRATITUDE FOR SUPPORT ON </p><p>POW/MIA, ESPECIALL PERMITTING THE USE OF HELICOPTERS IN </p><p>CAMBODIA.  DR. SOLOMON CITED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S SPEECH IN JANUARY </p><p>IN SINGAPORE AND THE COMMITMENT OF PRESIDENT BUSH TO MOVE </p><p>TOWARD NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH ALL THE NATIONS OF INDOCHINA </p><p>AS PROGRESS IS MADE ON POW/MIA.  THE MEETINGS IN HANOI, WITH </p><p>THE AGREEMENT ON THE FIVE-POINT PLAN, IF IMPLEMENTED SINCERELY, </p><p>WILL ADVANCE U.S. NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES </p><p>OF INDOCHINA.  THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH LIFED THE U.S. </p><p>EMBARGO ON CAMBODIA IS A SIGN OF U.S. SINCERITY, AS IS THE U.S. </p><p>INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FUNDING WHICH MAY REACH AS MUCH AS </p><p>USD 600 MILLION FOR THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>NEED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION, RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>---------- --------- ------------ ----------- ------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  DR. SOLOMON STRONGLY PRESSED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION </p><p>OF FACTIONAL FORCES.  THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST SECURITY </p><p>FOR CAMBODIA SINCE THE REMANANTS OF THE FACTIONS\' ARMIES COULD </p><p>RETURN TO FIGHTING.  PRINCE SIHANOUK AGREES WITH THIS APPROACH, </p><p>HE SAID.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, DR. SOLOMON STRESSED THAT, FOR </p><p>CAMBODIA TO OVERCOME THE BURDEN OF ITS TRAGIC PAST, IT WOULD BE </p><p>HARD TO OVER-EMPHASIZE HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE TOOK EXCEPTION WITH </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS MIGHT SOMEHOW </p><p>BE "OVERDONE."  HE STRESSED THAT THE UN WOULD HAVE THE </p><p>AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN CAMBODIA EVEN </p><p>AFTER UNTAC HAD LEFT.  THIS WOULD BE IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERN OVER KR NON-COOPERATION, MUST NOT GIVE KR EXCUSES </p><p>------ ----------- ------------- ----------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  DR. SOLOMON SAID THE U.S. CONSIDERS THE RESISTANCE OF THE </p><p>KR TO COOPERATE WITH THE PEACE AGREEMENT A MATTER OF SERIOUS </p><p>CONCERN.  THE KR HAVE SOUGHT ALL MEANS TO KEEP THE UN OUT OF </p><p>ITS ZONE.  THE KR COMPLAINS THAT THE VIETNAMESE ARE STILL </p><p>PRESENT AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEY MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT.  THE </p><p>U.S. CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER SOME VIETNAMESE TROOPS REMAIN IN </p><p>CAMBODIA, SOLOMON SAID.  IT IS UP TO UNTAC TO VERIFY THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES.  SOLOMON CONCLUDED THAT THE POINT </p><p>IS THAT, "ALL OTHER FACTIONS MUST ABIDE BY THE PEACE PLAN SO </p><p>THE KR HAS NO EXCUSES FOR NON-COOPERATION."  THIS WOULD </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S HAND IN BRINGING </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE KR.  THE SOC SHOULD FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE </p><p>RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THIS WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON </p><p>THE KR, WHO HAVE THUS FAR RELEASED NONE.  THE SOC AND OTHER </p><p>FACTIONS SHOULD ALSO COOPERATE COMPLETELY WITH UNAMIC/UNTAC AND </p><p>SHULD REFRAIN FROM ANY MILITARY OPEATION OR MOVEMENTS WHICH </p><p>VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT.  THE FACTIONS MUST PROVIDE </p><p>FULL ACCESS FOR THE UN TO THEIR ZONES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  SOLOMON SAID THAT THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL PLUARLISM IS </p><p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE IN </p><p>DEALING WITH THE KR.  THE U.S. IS DEEPLY DISTURBED BY POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN CAMBODIA, ESPECIALLY THE ASSASSINATION OF TEA BUN </p><p>LONG, THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF OPPOSITION FIGURE DUNG </p><p>PHAN, AND THE ATTACK ON KHIEU SAMPHAN.  THE ANGER OF PEOPLE AND </p><p>DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST THE KR IS UNDERSTANDABLE.  HE </p><p>REMINDED HOR NAMHONG OF SECRETARY BAKER\'S STATEMENT IN PARIS </p><p>THAT THE U.S. WOULD FAVOR EFFORTS TO BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE GENOCIDAL POLICIES OF POL POT TO JUSTICE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, ALL PARTIES MUST CREATE A SECURE ENVIRONMENT OR </p><p>THERE WOULD BE UNENDING VIOLENCE,  DR. SOLOMON SAID THE U.S. IS </p><p>AWARE THAT SOME IN THE SOC REGIME ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT NEW </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES BEING FOUNDED.  BUT POLITICAL OPENNESS IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL TO FIGHTING THE KR.  MOREOVER, IN THE U.S. THERE ARE </p><p>MANY PEOPLE BORN IN CAMBODIA WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TOWARD CAMBODIA\'S DEVELOPMENT.  THEY MUST FEEL SECURE OR THEY </p><p>WILL NOT BE WILLING TO RETURN AND PARTICIPATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FACTIONS MUST SHOW SETTLEMENT WORKING TO MAINTAIN U.S. SUPPORT </p><p>--------- ----------- ------------ -------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  A/S SOLOMON WARNED THAT IF THE UN SETTLEMENT IS NOT SEEN </p><p>TO BE WORKING, SOME IN THE U.S. SHOULD PAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS </p><p>OF DOLLARS FOR THE PEACE PLAN.  WHEN SOC PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN </p><p>TRAVELS TO WASHINGTON, HE WILL FACE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCORDS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED TO A.S SOLOMON\'S POINTS BY SAYING WE </p><p>MUST NOW WORK TO ACHIEVE 70 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION FIRST AND </p><p>PLEDGED THAT THE SOC WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL IT HAD RELEASED ALL </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THERE WILL BE ANOTHER RELEASE ON MARCH </p><p>23-24 OF PRISONERS FROM ODDAR MEANCHEY PROVINCE.  WHEN THE </p><p>PRINCE TRAVELS TO KOMPONG SOM, ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS HELD </p><p>HERE WILL ALSO BE RELEASED.  FINALLY, HE PROMISED THE SOC </p><p>AUTHORITIES WOULD INVESTIGATE THEIR OWN SYSTEM TO ENSURE THERE </p><p>ARE NO MORE POLITICAL PRISONERS HELD.  HOR NAMHONG WENT FURTHER </p><p>TO SAY THAT "WE ARE INTERVENING WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\' TO </p><p>IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR ALL OTHER PRISONERS.  THE SOC HAS ASKED </p><p>ICRC FOR HELP WITH MEDICINES AND FOOD TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IN </p><p>THE PRISONS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE SOC FOREIGN MINISTER PLEDGED THE SOC WOULD FULLY </p><p>COOPERATE WITH UNAMIC AND UNTAC ON MILITARY MATTERS.  HE SAID </p><p>THE SOC HAS NO NEED TO ENLARGE ITS ZONES AND SAID KARIM HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED COMPLETE SATISFACTION WITH SOC COOPERATION </p><p>MILITARILY.  THE SOC HAS FOUGHT BACK ONLY IN SELF-DEFENSE.  HE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT, FOR CAMBODIA, "THERE IS NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT </p><p>THE PARIS AGREEMENT.  WE SEE IT AS THE BEST CHOICE TO END THE </p><p>WAR." </p><p> </p><p>HOR NAMHONG WORRIES FREEDOM WILL BE USED FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>---------- ---------- ------------ ----------- -------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  REGARDING POLITICAL VIOLENCE, HOR NAMHONG SAID THIS WAS </p><p>WHAT HE MEANT WHEN HE SAID "OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS."  HE </p><p>SAID, "IT IS EASY TO USE VIOLENCE AND THEN ACCUSE THE PHNOM </p><p>PENH GOVERNMENT."  IT WAS OTHERS WHO PROFIT FROM THESE CRIMES, </p><p>HE ALLEGED.  HE SAID THE VIOLENCE DOES NOT AFFECT JUST PEOPLE </p><p>LIKE TEA RUN LONG AND DUNG PHAN.  HE SAID THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINSTG BOTH HIM AND HUN SEN AND THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN AN ATTACK ON HIS SON.  HOR NAMHONG CONCLUDED, </p><p>"WE NEED TO DIVIDE THE POLITICIANS FROM THOSE WHO WOULD USE </p><p>FORCE."  WHILE THERE WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULTIES, WE MUST BE </p><p>PATIENT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>16.  SICHAN SIV INTERJECTED TO SUPPORT A/S SOLOMON\'S POINTS. </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS IS ONE OF THE AREAS FOR WHICH HE IS RESPONSIBILE </p><p>IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IS A CORNERSTONE OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>SIV EMPHASIZED THAT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS GOES WELL BEYOND </p><p>SIMPLY FREEING POLITICAL PRISONERS.  IT INCLUDES FREEDOMS OF </p><p>PRESS, RELIGION, AND ASSOCIATION, AMONG OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED THAT,  "WE HAVE THE SAME </p><p>UNDERSTANDING (OF HUMAN RIGHTS), THAT IT IS NOT JUST RELEASING </p><p>PRISONERS."  HE CITED THE SIDE RANGE OF AGREEMENTS ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AT THE JANUARY 14 MEETING IN PHNOM PENH AND THE </p><p>PROTECTIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REVISED SOC CONSTITUTION. </p><p>"WE ASK OTHERS TO IMPLEMENT THESE RIGHTS 100 PERCENT." </p><p>JOURNALIST WHO CAN TRAVEL IN THE GOC-CONTROLLED AREAS MUST ALSO </p><p>BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH THE OTHER ZONES, FOR INSTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>SOLOMON WARNS CORRUPTION COULD PLAY INTO HANDS OF KR </p><p>-------------- -------------- ---------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  SOLOMON CONCLUDED BY SAYING THE U.S. HOPES THE SOC WILL </p><p>GET CONTROL OF THE CORRUPTION.  CORRUPTION AMONG SOC OFFICIALS </p><p>"WILL ERECT A BARRIER AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE KR."  NOR </p><p>NAMHONG EXPRESSED HIS AGREEMENT AND SAID THE SOC HAS TAKEN </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST CORRUPTION, INCLUDING DISMISSING SOME </p><p>MINISTERS.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAD PROPOSED THAT THE MINISTERS </p><p>BE SENTENCED PUBLICLY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE MEETING PROVIDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR GIVE AND TAKE </p><p>ON THE ISSUES AND FOR THE U.S. TO STRESS THE NEED TO RESPECT </p><p>THE ACCORDS TO ENSURE THE KR HAS NO EXCUSES FOR </p><p>NON-COOPERATION.  IT IS CLEAR THE SOC IS NOW OPPOSED TO MOVING </p><p>TO 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION.  THE MOST WORRISOME COMMENT BY </p><p>THE SOC FOREIGN MINISTER WAS HIS CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>WOULD BE USED AS PRETEXT FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>20.  A/S SOLOMON CLEARED THIS MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
