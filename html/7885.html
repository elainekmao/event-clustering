<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN HIKES CONSUMER FUEL PRICES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2569 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary. The GOJ raised prices of oil derivatives </p><p>and by-products an average of four to eight per cent </p><p>effective May 7, 2003.  Finance Minister Marto and other </p><p>senior officials confirmed publicly and privately that this </p><p>was the first installment in a plan to raise consumer prices </p><p>of petroleum products to world levels -- exactly as agreed </p><p>with the United States last year.  Initial public reaction to </p><p>the decision has been muted.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The Cabinet decided on May 6 to raise consumer </p><p>prices of virtually all oil derivatives and by-products </p><p>effective May 7.  Price increases include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooking gas cylinders up from $3.53 to $4.23 </p><p>-- Gallon of regular petrol from $1.47 to $1.60 </p><p>-- Gallon of first-grade petrol (super) from $1.97 to $2.13 </p><p>-- Gallon of unleaded petrol from $2.27 to 2.40 </p><p>-- Gallon of kerosene and diesel from $0.64 to $0.69 </p><p>-- Metric Tons of fuel oil used in industries will rise </p><p>   from $108.57 to $115.62 </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Finance Minister Michel Marto told the press that </p><p>the government took the new measures "because all aid to the </p><p>Kingdom from the United States, Japan, and the European Union </p><p>is contingent on implementing our agreement with the </p><p>International Monetary Fund (IMF) calling for the completion </p><p>of reforms which started in Jordan in the past years."  He </p><p>added that when the government prepared the 2003 state budget </p><p>it calculated the world market price for oil at $26/barrel, </p><p>but in the past four months Jordan had to pay as much as $30 </p><p>per barrel. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Reiterating points made by Prime Minister Abu Ragheb </p><p>to the press last week (ref), Marto said that this was the </p><p>first of a series of price increases that would eliminate </p><p>subsidies on oil products.  He said, for instance, that a </p><p>cylinder of gas costs at least $4.94 to produce.  With annual </p><p>sales of 24 million cylinders of gas in the Kingdom, this </p><p>means an annual loss of about $35.25 million to the treasury. </p><p> Marto was quoted in al-Rai, the leading Arabic daily, as </p><p>saying, "The government will gradually increase prices of oil </p><p>products so that in three years time there will be no more </p><p>subsidies." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  In a May 7 meeting with ECON/C and a visiting U.S. </p><p>Treasury team examining Iraqi accounts in Jordan, Marto </p><p>elaborated that the Government\'s decision had been cleared by </p><p>the King.  He confirmed that it was the first step in the </p><p>plan described to the United States in November 2002 to raise </p><p>consumer prices of petroleum taxes to international levels </p><p>(including an appropriate tax) over a three-year period.  He </p><p>said this initial increase would generate additional revenues </p><p>of JD 4.5 million per month ($55 million/year).  Additional </p><p>increases would follow the schedule given to the United </p><p>States.  Marto said that when he told the IMF mission chief </p><p>about the price increases on May 6, the staffer praised the </p><p>decision as further evidence of Jordan\'s ability to deliver </p><p>on its commitments and meet its IMF targets. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  In addition to the oil products price increase, </p><p>the cabinet authorized an increase from 2 to 4% in the </p><p>General Sales Tax (GST) rate applied to food and other basic </p><p>commodities.  The cabinet also approved imposition of a 5% </p><p>tax on interest income earned on bank accounts, which had </p><p>previously been tax-exempt.  Marto said this rate would be </p><p>raised to the income tax rate over time. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  Synchronized with the price increases, the </p><p>Public Transport Regulatory Commission raised fare schedules </p><p>for public transportation vehicles using diesel and petrol </p><p>fuel.  This is the fifth such increase in consumer prices </p><p>over the past three years.  Marto predicted grumbling, but </p><p>acceptance by the public, particularly in the context of the </p><p>economic fallout on Jordan of the war in Iraq.  So far, we </p><p>have seen no negative blow-back from the decision on the </p><p>streets or in the press, though there was a run on filling </p><p>stations overnight that led to long waiting lines throughout </p><p>the city. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  In post\'s considered opinion, the commitment Jordan </p><p>made in November to raise oil product prices to world levels </p><p>is solid.  In addition to the public statements of the </p><p>government\'s intention, this is a policy of the King that </p><p>will not change when governments or ministers change. </p><p>Planning Minister Awadallah, an economic policy confidant of </p><p>the King, also told ECON/C on May 5 that the King is </p><p>completely on board with the policy of eliminating fiscal </p><p>distortions, including Jordan\'s historical dependence on </p><p>cheap oil, and will ensure that this policy is implemented. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
