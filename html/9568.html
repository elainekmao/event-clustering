Still, seven confirmed releases - </p><p>- some of which are long-standing religious prisoners about </p><p>whom no information had been available for years -- welcome </p><p>and will be reflected in this year\'s reports on </p><p>international religious liberty and on human rights.

Hoa Hao Buddhist monks </p><p>opposed him.  On the occasion of the foundation of the Hoa </p><p>Hao Buddhism (30 March 2000), Liem masterminded some </p><p>sabotaging activities, including the attempt to create </p><p>blasts at the worshipping site of Huynh families and An Hoa </p><p>Pagoda to complicate the situation and blame the authorities </p><p>for crack-down on Hoa Hao Buddhist monks, provoking </p><p>extremist monks to set themselves in fire for martyrdom. </p><p>(Per Embassy\'s earlier information, Liem founded and chaired </p><p>the non-recognized Hoa Hao Central Buddhist Church and was </p><p>placed under Administrative probation in late March 2001.) </p><p> </p><p>29.
