<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000248 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL/CRA, AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KDEM, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: USG HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY FOR BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 13796 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  The following draft report is provided in response </p><p>to tasking contained in reftel.  The text of the report has </p><p>also been sent by e-mail to EAP/BCLTV. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Begin report text: </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Rangoon Human Rights Strategy for Burma </p><p> </p><p>The United States has staked out a position in Burma as a </p><p>resolute advocate of human rights and rapid political change. </p><p> We have also worked with like-minded countries to maintain </p><p>maximum international pressure on Burma, pending reform. </p><p>That pressure includes continued trade, investment, and </p><p>travel sanctions; the denial of any form of aid support, with </p><p>the single exception of humanitarian assistance; continued </p><p>public criticism of Burma; support for democratic movements </p><p>opposed to the current dictatorship; and public diplomacy </p><p>programs focused on democratic values, human rights, and good </p><p>governance.  It also includes support for international </p><p>efforts to foster change in Burma, through the missions of UN </p><p>Special Envoy Razali and UN Special Rapporteur on Human </p><p>Rights Pinheiro, as well as the efforts of the ILO, the ICRC, </p><p>and other international organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Sanctions: In coordination with the European Union and other </p><p>states, the United States has imposed comprehensive sanctions </p><p>on Burma.  They include an arms embargo; a ban on all new </p><p>U.S. investment in Burma; the suspension of all bilateral </p><p>aid, including counternarcotics assistance; the withdrawal of </p><p>GSP privileges, the denial of OPIC and EXIMBANK programs; </p><p>visa restrictions on Burma\'s senior government officials; and </p><p>a hold on all new lending or grant programs by the World </p><p>bank, the IMF, the ADB, and other international financial </p><p>institutions.  We have also maintained our representation in </p><p>Burma at the Charge d\'Affaires level since 1990. </p><p> </p><p>Public Criticism: The United States has co-sponsored annual </p><p>resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission </p><p>on Human Rights that highlight and draw international </p><p>attention to the continued human rights violations in Burma. </p><p>We also support the ILO\'s unprecedented decision which calls </p><p>on all ILO members to review their relations with Burma in </p><p>view of its "widespread and systematic" use of forced labor, </p><p>as well as the ILO\'s efforts since then to bring the Burmese </p><p>government in compliance with its obligations.  Annual U.S. </p><p>reports on human rights and religious freedom in Burma have </p><p>also painted a grim picture of continuing violations here. </p><p> </p><p>Public Scrutiny: The United States has encouraged increased </p><p>public scrutiny of the human rights situation in Burma.  We </p><p>have supported the missions of UN Special Envoy Razali, who </p><p>has traveled to Burma eight times since 2000, and the mission </p><p>of UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro, who has visited Burma four </p><p>times.  Their combined efforts have resulted in the release </p><p>of over 500 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, </p><p>additional freedoms for the political opposition </p><p>(particularly in regard to ability to travel), and the </p><p>re-opening of opposition political party offices.  We have </p><p>also encouraged ICRC\'s efforts to improve the conditions of </p><p>Burma\'s prisons, facilitate the release of political </p><p>prisoners, and protect vulnerable ethnic populations.  ICRC </p><p>now has over 40 expatriate staff in Burma and access to many </p><p>previously restricted areas along the Thai border.  In </p><p>addition, we have urged all UN agencies to join UNHCR (now </p><p>active among the Rohingya Muslim minority in northern Rakhine </p><p>State) in providing protection services and advocacy on human </p><p>rights issues in areas where they are active.  Finally, we </p><p>have pushed the Burmese government to accept visits by </p><p>reputed international human rights organizations, such as </p><p>Amnesty International, which completed its first visit to </p><p>Burma in February 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Support for the Democratic Opposition:  The United States </p><p>annually provides $6.5 million in support for the Burmese </p><p>democratic opposition.  These funds are programmed through </p><p>the National Endowment for Democracy, among others, and are </p><p>used for the collection and dissemination of information on </p><p>democracy and human rights, and the support of democratic </p><p>groups, including women\'s, labor, and ethnic groups, in Burma </p><p>and along Burma\'s borders.  Specific activities include </p><p>support for newspapers, radio broadcasts, and investigations </p><p>of human rights violations, as reported by refugees and </p><p>exiles. </p><p> </p><p>Advocacy: The U.S. Mission in Burma has been a persistent and </p><p>effective advocate for human rights.  We maintain frequent </p><p>contacts with the political opposition, including the </p><p>National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi, and </p><p>regularly consult with a range of opposition leaders </p><p>regarding initiatives that will affect the struggle for </p><p>democracy in Burma.  We maintain similar contacts with </p><p>representatives of Burma\'s ethnic minorities who have been </p><p>struggling for a voice in Burma\'s government for more than </p><p>half a century.  We have also pressed the government in </p><p>strong and public terms to honestly and effectively </p><p>investigate allegations of human rights abuses.  In 2002, </p><p>when the Burmese government categorically denied that its </p><p>soldiers had been involved in any of the rapes detailed in a </p><p>report entitled "License to Rape," the Mission\'s Charge\' </p><p>called the government to account at a public press conference </p><p>and continued to press for an investigation of the charges by </p><p>an independent international team.  Those efforts resulted in </p><p>continued international attention to the case, continued </p><p>government investigations of the charges, and a government </p><p>invitation to UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro to investigate </p><p>the case.  The U.S. Mission in Burma has also spoken out </p><p>firmly in support of the political rights of the democratic </p><p>opposition.  When Aung San Suu Kyi was harassed by </p><p>government-affiliated organizations during a tour of Rakhine </p><p>State, the U.S. Mission coordinated statements with Great </p><p>Britain, among others, which called the government to account. </p><p> </p><p>Public Diplomacy: We continue to focus public diplomacy </p><p>programs on democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and </p><p>good governance.  In FY 2002, the Embassy\'s Public Affairs </p><p>section spent $205,000 on speaker programs, exchange </p><p>programs, and publications and other information outreach. </p><p>In FY 2003, we expanded our international visitors program by </p><p>$105,000 to include six additional grantees from civil </p><p>society organizations active in their communities.  In </p><p>addition, the Public Affairs section\'s direct teaching </p><p>program offered tuition waivers worth $8,000 to 33 students </p><p>denied the opportunity to study elsewhere because of their </p><p>political beliefs.  These programs target individuals from </p><p>humanitarian aid NGO\'s, the political opposition, religious </p><p>and ethnic groups, the press, and academia, with the aim of </p><p>assisting civil society organizations in developing their own </p><p>effective advocacy on democracy and human rights issues in </p><p>Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Addendum: USG-funded Human Rights and Democracy Programs in </p><p>Burma (FY 2002) </p><p> </p><p>Burma Earmark -- $6.5 million, including </p><p> </p><p>The New Era Journal; $140,000 </p><p> </p><p>Support and Training for Democratic Opposition; implemented </p><p>by the International Republican Institute; $470,000 </p><p> </p><p>Building Capacity for a Free Burma; implemented by the </p><p>National Democratic Institute for International Affairs; </p><p>$122,535 </p><p> </p><p>The Burma Fund; $450,000 </p><p> </p><p>The Democratic Voice of Burma radio; $160,000 </p><p> </p><p>Promoting Labor\'s Involvement in Burma\'s Democratic Struggle; </p><p>implemented by the American Center for International Labor </p><p>Solidarity; $425,033. </p><p> </p><p>End report text. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
