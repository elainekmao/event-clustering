<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA FRONT OFFICE, NEA/PD, NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, SCUL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE: SURVEY ON </p><p>EDUCATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 117997 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY BERRY PER 1.5 (B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In response to reftel, Embassy Amman supports the </p><p>continuation and development of basic education reform </p><p>projects in Jordan and attests to the GOJ\'s and Jordanian </p><p>education sector\'s interest and receptivity to such programs. </p><p> The GOJ has demonstrated a high-level of receptivity to USG </p><p>assistance in education reform in the past, including at the </p><p>elmentary level.  In addition, recent directives from the </p><p>Royal Palace to modernize and reform the education system in </p><p>Jordan may indicate an even more inviting environment for USG </p><p>assistance, especially in the fields of preschool and </p><p>adolescent civics, English language, and information </p><p>technology.  However, the delicate issue of national </p><p>education, combined with current sensitivities in the region, </p><p>means that the level of receptivity by the GOJ and education </p><p>sector may require that USG partnership in education reform </p><p>programs remain relatively low-profile. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PA Amman has coordinated programs in education </p><p>reform in cooperation with the GOJ for many years, including </p><p>at the elementary education level.  The Civic Education </p><p>Workshop is one example of a program that trained </p><p>approximately 100 middle-school teachers and supervisors in </p><p>basic civics education.  In addition to the training </p><p>workshop, the U.S. based Center for Civic Education worked </p><p>with the Ministry of Education to translate civics textbooks </p><p>into Arabic for use in extracurricular programs in Jordanian </p><p>middle schools.  This program\'s initial success resulted in </p><p>the inclusion of the textbooks and corresponding civics </p><p>lessons in the Jordanian national curriculum starting this </p><p>September.  The Ministry of Education has communicated to PA </p><p>its interest in expanding this civic education initiative by </p><p>further developing textbooks and a curriculum for high school </p><p>and elementary age students. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Ministry of Education also has expressed </p><p>interest in seeking additional USG assistance for information </p><p>technology materials and training for all education levels </p><p>including basic education.  Project activities under the </p><p>USAID-financed AMIR contract will help support such </p><p>initiatives.  Encouraging more entreprenuerial skills is the </p><p>purpose of a grant for a junior achievement type grant, </p><p>INJAZ, and discussions currently are being held with a number </p><p>of organizations interested in early-childhood, adolescent, </p><p>and life-skills education, especially for girls in rural </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)   Past USG assistance programs in education reform </p><p>have been successful in Jordan, and such programs continue to </p><p>be in demand by the GOJ.  However, with sensitivities running </p><p>high in the region, and with basic education an issue of </p><p>national pride and ownership, we should reserve direct USG </p><p>assistance in education reform to very targeted, low-profile </p><p>programs.  High-profile USG assistance and perceived USG </p><p>direction could create difficulty for the GOJ in gaining </p><p>popular support for its overall education reform program. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
