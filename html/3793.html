<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001778 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>NEW DELHI PLS PASS TO AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-24-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PINR, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Reviewing recent talks, Muslim leader says he is </p><p>"cautiously optimistic" about state of peace process </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Bangkok 6663, and previous </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1751, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Charge met September 24 with Rauf Hakeem, </p><p>the Muslim leader who was a member of the GSL\'s team at the </p><p>recent talks with the Tamil Tigers.  Hakeem remarked on the </p><p>positive atmospherics of the talks, noting that he was now </p><p>"cautiously optimistic" about the peace process.  Mulling </p><p>over possible long-term power-sharing modalities, he </p><p>planned to meet soon with Tiger leader Prabhakaran in order </p><p>to press for "guarantees" for Muslims.  Hakeem seems </p><p>comfortable with the current situation, which indicates </p><p>that the volatile Muslim angle is being managed well by the </p><p>GSL and Tigers, so far.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>========================================= </p><p>Muslim Leader Positive about recent Talks </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Charge met Rauf Hakeem, the leader of the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC), and GSL Minister for Ports and </p><p>Shipping, on September 24.  Hakeem, who was a member of the </p><p>GSL\'s delegation at the recent talks with the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), remarked on the positive </p><p>atmospherics of the talks (see Reftels).  There were </p><p>productive discussions on many issues, he noted, with the </p><p>LTTE side focused on issues related to assistance to the </p><p>north and east.  Hakeem said he found chief LTTE negotiator </p><p>Anton Balasingham "quite impressive."  Balasingham\'s </p><p>health, however, did not seem particularly good, and he </p><p>could not sit down and negotiate for long stretches at a </p><p>time. (Note:  Balasingham has a serious kidney condition.) </p><p>V. Rudrakumar, another member of the LTTE team, was also </p><p>active during the talks, especially on legal and </p><p>constitutional issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Queried about the closing press conference, Hakeem </p><p>replied that Balasingham\'s remarks edging away from </p><p>separatism were positive, as were his comments about </p><p>Muslims, in general.  That said, the LTTE had to do more </p><p>than say nice words that could have "shifting meanings." </p><p>It was imperative that the group take "concrete steps to </p><p>protect Muslims."  Overall, Hakeem allowed that he was now </p><p>"cautiously optimistic" about the state of the peace </p><p>process after the talks, but underscored that more progress </p><p>needed to be made. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Next Step:  Meeting Prabhakaran </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hakeem\'s next step was his upcoming meeting with </p><p>LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran in the LTTE-controlled Wanni </p><p>region in northern Sri Lanka.  This meeting was crucial, he </p><p>averred.  It was fine to meet with Balasingham and other </p><p>LTTE representatives, but Prabhakaran was the key figure in </p><p>the organization and known to be "in total control." </p><p>Hakeem said he would use this meeting to press Prabhakaran </p><p>to lend substance to the LTTE\'s public commitment to </p><p>protect the rights of Muslims in the north and east.  In </p><p>doing this, the discussions would delve into the details of </p><p>a possible final settlement (see more below).  It was </p><p>important that progress be made in this meeting, Hakeem </p><p>noted, so that he had something to take back to the Muslim </p><p>community, especially those in the ethnically mixed and </p><p>volatile east.  (Note:  The slated meeting with Prabhakaran </p><p>would be Hakeem\'s second this year.  He met Prabhakaran in </p><p>April, and the two announced several "understandings" re </p><p>Muslim rights in the north and east.  Muslims as a rule </p><p>feel the LTTE did not live up to these understandings.) </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Mulling over the Long-term </p><p>========================== </p><p>5.  (C) When asked, Hakeem mulled over possible long-term </p><p>power-sharing arrangements for the north and east.  He </p><p>noted that his thinking on this issue was in the formative </p><p>stages and he still sought "imaginative" ideas on ways to </p><p>handle the Muslim situation.  At this point, however, he </p><p>was leaning toward the idea that Muslim representatives </p><p>would serve with Tamils in a provincial council for the </p><p>north and east based in Trincomalee.      The chief </p><p>minister of the north and east would probably be a Tamil </p><p>and the deputy a Muslim.  Because Tamils (i.e., the LTTE) </p><p>were bound to dominate such a structure, however, it was </p><p>important that Muslims receive "additional guarantees." </p><p>While Muslims would not demand their own province, it was </p><p>important that power in the north and east devolve to the </p><p>local level to a large extent.  This would allow Muslim </p><p>communities interspersed throughout the region the ability </p><p>to govern their own affairs to a large extent.  Finally, </p><p>the LTTE had to formally accept that there could be no re- </p><p>distribution of populations.  (Note:  Some in LTTE and </p><p>Tamil ranks see re-distribution as a good way to diminish </p><p>Muslim influence in the north and east.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In drawing this tentative description of a possible </p><p>settlement, Hakeem underscored that he rejected the notion </p><p>that there would be an "interim" followed by a "final" </p><p>settlement.  He claimed that the idea of such a staggered </p><p>accord was pushed most often by the LTTE as a way to cloak </p><p>its desire for an eventual separate status for Tamils. </p><p>Coming back to a thread he had mentioned earlier, Hakeem </p><p>again underlined that it was important that GSL negotiators </p><p>continue to press the LTTE to clearly define its terms. </p><p>The group always carefully chose its words, but these words </p><p>upon subsequent review often did not mean what they </p><p>initially seemed. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Hakeem seems relatively comfortable with the </p><p>current situation.  This is in marked contrast to his </p><p>agitated state during the summer months, when Tamils and </p><p>Muslims in the east were at each other\'s throats.  The fact </p><p>that Hakeem seems somewhat confident indicates that the </p><p>complex Muslim angle is being managed well by the GSL and </p><p>Tigers, so far.  Clearly, the fact that the GSL has let </p><p>Hakeem join its team for the talks has been a source of </p><p>encouragement for Muslims.  In addition, Hakeem seems to be </p><p>hearing the right sounds from the LTTE at this point re the </p><p>group\'s commitment to Muslim rights in the east.  For </p><p>progress to continue, it is important that Prabhakaran work </p><p>hard during the upcoming meeting in the Wanni to give </p><p>Hakeem the ironclad guarantees he needs to take back to the </p><p>Muslim community.  Hakeem still is not sure that the LTTE </p><p>is there yet.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
