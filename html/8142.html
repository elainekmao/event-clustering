HARARE 516 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) MDC activist Sedweak Munyaradzi Mupazviripo Munya </p><p>(protect) has informed embassy officer that he had made and </p><p>thrown nine petrol bombs at three different ZANU-PF </p><p>meetings-in-progress on about April 25.  It is likely that </p><p>MDC security head Solomon Chikowero is the highest MDC </p><p>official aware of Munya\'s activities.  However, in the </p><p>current economic downturn, there are likely many other </p><p>unemployed young men with tenuous connections to the MDC who </p><p>could be inclined to commit similar acts.  We continue to </p><p>press the MDC leadership to make their best effort to nip </p><p>these activities in the bud.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Confessed Bomber </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In a May 8 conversation with Poloff, MDC activist </p><p>Sedweak Munyaradzi Mupazviripo Munya revealed that he had </p><p>made and thrown nine petrol bombs at three different ZANU-PF </p><p>meetings-in-progress on about April 25.  Munya said that to </p><p>his knowledge the highest MDC official involved in initiating </p><p>these activities was Solomon (Sox) Chikowero, who MDC </p><p>intelligence officers identify as the head of MDC </p><p>intelligence (Ref B).  Munya called him the head of MDC </p><p>security.  (Note: Chikowero recently fled to South Africa </p><p>after repeated threats on his life by alleged CIO officers, </p><p>and is reportedly staying at a training facility where MDC </p><p>members have allegedly received military-style training in </p><p>the past.  End Note.)  Activities such as those undertaken by </p><p>Munya were executed using the MDC\'s "action committees" - </p><p>communication and meetings structures set up by the MDC </p><p>security department to convey orders and pass information </p><p>between the MDC leadership and activists around the country. </p><p>With Chikowero out of the country, Munya said there are no </p><p>current plans afoot for more bombings. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Munya said he had attended planning meetings of up to </p><p>fifteen people led by MDC MP\'s including Fidelis Mhashu.  In </p><p>the planning meetings, they discussed National Youth Service </p><p>members (green bombers) beating hundreds of MDC activists and </p><p>residents in Harare\'s high-density suburbs following the </p><p>March 18-19 MDC stayaway.  They decided to lob petrol bombs </p><p>into green bombers\' meetings in order to disrupt their </p><p>planning, and to intimidate them, although these attacks were </p><p>not intended to kill anyone.  Munya\'s awareness was limited </p><p>to the planning meetings he had personally attended, and the </p><p>activities in which he participated. </p><p> </p><p>Targeted Green Bombers </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Munya claims to be a longtime MDC activist whose </p><p>network of contacts includes hundreds of Chitungwiza </p><p>residents, including police officers and army soldiers. </p><p>(Note: Munya\'s credibility is uncorroborated, and the </p><p>bombings he described were not reported in the press.  End </p><p>Note.)  Munya told Poloff that his contacts revealed that the </p><p>heads of the "One Commando Barracks" (an army barracks along </p><p>the airport road near Harare) had supplied green bombers with </p><p>army T-shirts and camouflage trousers (under the table). </p><p>Munya also said that green bombers had been assigned as </p><p>constabularies to Harare Central Police Station and St. </p><p>Mary\'s Police Station (near Harare).  War veterans who had </p><p>been hired into the ZRP in 2001 directed these </p><p>constabularies.  According to Munya these two police stations </p><p>occasionally issued the constabularies loaded AK-47 rifles, </p><p>which they carried during green bomber raids on the homes of </p><p>MDC activists in the days following the March 18-19 stayaway. </p><p> During the raids, the green bombers wore fatigues from One </p><p>Commando Barracks and carried baton sticks reportedly from </p><p>the Tomlinson Depot.  The constabularies were in plain </p><p>clothes. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Activists, including Munya, first surveiled green </p><p>bombers for at least three days, noting their meeting times </p><p>and locations, before attacking.  Munya borrowed a car with </p><p>one or two other associates, and made bombs with 750 ml wine </p><p>bottles half-filled with petrol and a cloth wick/fuse.  Late </p><p>at night on about April 25 at the Chibuku Stadium, they </p><p>lobbed three of these bombs onto at least one parked vehicle </p><p>that they had determined was carrying camouflage trousers and </p><p>T-shirts from the One Commando Barracks.  Green bombers and </p><p>war vets were holding a meeting nearby. </p><p>6. (S) On the same night, they lobbed another four bombs over </p><p>the wall of the residence of a ZANU-PF Councilor for Seke </p><p>named Manombo (first name unknown).  Green bombers and war </p><p>vets were holding a large meeting in the yard behind; Munya </p><p>said they lobbed the bombs over the wall in the direction of </p><p>the meeting.  The bombs lighted, they heard shouting and </p><p>commotion and some attendees fled the yard over the wall. </p><p>They following day they heard that no-one had been injured. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Again on the same night, they lobbed two bombs into a </p><p>meeting of green bombers and war vets being held in an open </p><p>area under a large tree in the light industrial area of </p><p>Chitungwiza. </p><p> </p><p>Tortured by CIO </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Although none of these petrol bombings was reported in </p><p>the press, on April 30 suspected CIO agents raided Munya\'s </p><p>house at about 2 o\'clock in the morning.  They fired a tear </p><p>gas canister into his house, pried his security gate off with </p><p>a power drill, and took him to Harare Central Police Station. </p><p> They interrogated him, beat him with broom handles on the </p><p>kidneys, put a large clamp on the back of his neck, poured </p><p>water on him, forced him to crawl on his belly like an inch </p><p>worm, and administered electric shocks.  They told him there </p><p>were only two options, that he would need to go to jail for </p><p>other charges he faces (see paragraph 10 below), or he must </p><p>die. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) They accused him of being the MDC\'s general </p><p>coordinator for explosives, and for participating in various </p><p>high-profile petrol bombings around the time of the March </p><p>18-19 stayaway including a school bus carrying primary school </p><p>aged children in Chitungwiza, a Zimbabwe United Passenger </p><p>Company (ZUPCO) bus in Epworth, and the ZANU-PF offices in </p><p>Kwekwe.  (Note: Other sources familiar with the Kwekwe event </p><p>have suggested that when ZANU-PF youths petrol bombed the </p><p>General Agricultural and Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe </p><p>(GAPWUZ) Kwekwe offices in March, the fire spread to the </p><p>ZANU-PF offices next door.  End Note.)  (Further Note:  It is </p><p>unclear why they accused him of these bombings and not the </p><p>petrol bombings he had actually participated in only days </p><p>earlier.  End further note.) </p><p> </p><p>Charged with Assaulting Ben Menashe </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Poloff first met Munya in February at the treason </p><p>trial of MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai and other MDC </p><p>leaders.  In about the second week of the trial, Munya </p><p>actually confronted the State\'s star witness Ari Ben Menashe </p><p>and asked him whether he was aware that ordinary Zimbabweans </p><p>could hardly feed themselves while he, Ben Menashe, was </p><p>living extravagantly at the Sheraton Hotel, eating rice and </p><p>chips at taxpayers\' expense and publicly lying to everyone. </p><p>Ben Menashe responded that he was not aware of the suffering. </p><p> Their conversation was interrupted by a suspected CIO agent </p><p>who accosted Munya.  Police then arrested Munya and charged </p><p>him with assaulting Ben Menashe. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) On about May 4, Munya happened to meet Maxwell </p><p>Matanire, the Magistrate handling Munya\'s case on charges of </p><p>assaulting Ben Menashe, at a local shop near Munya\'s home in </p><p>Chitungwiza.  The Magistrate, who has been suspended until </p><p>June 23 pending an investigation into trumped up allegations </p><p>of fraud, took him aside and cautioned him that he was being </p><p>forced to convict Munya and sentence him to at least four </p><p>years in prison.  Matanire said the only way for the </p><p>authorities to fire a sitting Magistrate was to convict him </p><p>on corruption or fraud charges and that the charges against </p><p>him were fabricated to influence his decisions, and </p><p>specifically to gain a conviction against Munya.  Matanire </p><p>said that suspected CIO agents had taken him to a meeting </p><p>with Vice President Joseph Msika who told him, among other </p><p>things, that he must convict Munya for four years or more, or </p><p>he would lose his magistrate job in the pending fraud </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Although some of the events Munya described dovetail </p><p>with other pieces of information we have obtained separately, </p><p>it is not possible to corroborate the claims he has made. We </p><p>are also unable to judge how compartmentalized the alleged </p><p>MDC structures he described may be.  There is no credible </p><p>evidence of awareness or direction of the actions of Munya </p><p>and his accomplices at levels of MDC leadership above </p><p>Chikowero.  Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman Ncube and other MDC </p><p>leaders have repeatedly assured us that violence is </p><p>antithetical to MDC policy.  This does not mean that all </p><p>elements within MDC share this view.  With Chikowero out of </p><p>the country, it is possible that violence of this nature will </p><p>cease, if he is indeed the organizing force.  However, we </p><p>note that in Sox\' absence a bomb squad official was killed </p><p>while handling a suspicious package sent to the tobacco </p><p>auction floor about ten days ago in a still unexplained </p><p>attack reported to us (but not in the press) by the head of </p><p>the Tobacco Growers\' Association and corroborated by other </p><p>sources.  In addition to whatever organized forces might </p><p>exist, there is also the legion of disaffected and unemployed </p><p>urban youth with tenuous connections to the opposition who </p><p>may be inclined to act on their own, whatever stated MDC </p><p>policy might be.  We will continue to press the MDC </p><p>leadership to counsel their supporters to eschew violence, </p><p>and given the sensitive nature of this issue, we have </p><p>suspended further contacts with Munya and will follow suit </p><p>with Chikowero, should the latter return to Zimbabwe.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
