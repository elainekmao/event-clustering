(U)  During a meeting with Ambassador Jeter on March 28, </p><p>Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Makarfi discussed at length his </p><p>desire to bring in a U.S. company to exploit solid minerals </p><p>in his state.  He claimed that there were squatters </p><p>illegally mining gold and other precious metals in Kaduna. </p><p>He asked for USG assistance in first determining what </p><p>minerals were present and whether or not they exist in </p><p>commercially viable quantities for exploitation.  Second, he </p><p>asked that U.S. natural resource firms be "invited" to </p><p>consider developing Kaduna\'s natural resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Makarfi also claimed that Libyan firms had </p><p>approached him about exploiting these resources, and </p><p>expressed a desire not to have a major Libyan presence in </p><p>Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Action request for USGS.  What information does the </p><p>USGS have regarding the presence of solid minerals in Kaduna </p><p>State? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Action request for Department of Commerce.  There appears </p><p>to be the potential for minerals development in Kaduna </p><p>State.  Does USDOC know of any U.S. companies which might </p><p>be interested in exploring this possibility, or have </p><p>expressed interest in solid minerals exploration and production in </p><p>Nigeria? </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
