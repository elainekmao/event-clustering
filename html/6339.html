<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 002231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/AGS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER-PRESIDENT KOCH\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON MAY </p><p>13-15 </p><p> </p><p>REF: FRANKFURT 550 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Hesse Minister-President Koch will have an official </p><p>visit Washington May 13-15.  Koch would like to focus on </p><p>international affairs, the U.S.-German relationship, </p><p>potential U.S. military base closings in Germany, Iraq, US- </p><p>EU issues, and counter-terrorism and security issues and </p><p>will be seeking appropriate appointments through official </p><p>channels.  Koch also has an interest in Asia, particularly </p><p>in increasing market access in China for German companies, </p><p>and in the Tibet issue. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Minister-President Koch is a likely challenger for </p><p>chancellor candidate to Christian Democratic Union (CDU) </p><p>chairman Angela Merkel in 2006, and has a strong interest in </p><p>foreign affairs and the United States in particular.  (See </p><p>reftel bio cable on Koch for more details.)  He and his </p><p>party won an absolute majority in Hesse state elections on </p><p>February 2, 2003, increasing his standing and influence in </p><p>the CDU nationally.  The request for the visit has already </p><p>gone through the German Foreign Ministry, which will </p><p>coordinate with the German Embassy.  We believe it is </p><p>important that Koch obtain substantive meetings at the </p><p>highest appropriate level at the Department, on the Hill and </p><p>at the Department of Defense.  Koch announced his visit </p><p>during CDU Chairman Angela Merkel\'s visit and is in </p><p>competition with Merkel for influence in the CDU.  He will </p><p>likely want a good deal of press attention for his visit. </p><p>Koch may also wish to visit Wisconsin during this trip, </p><p>which has a sister-state relationship with Hesse.  Koch is </p><p>also a personal friend of HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, whom </p><p>he knows from his days as Governor of Wisconsin. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Pol/Econ Chief Ruth M. Hall will be point of contact </p><p>at the Consulate for any follow up questions or </p><p>coordination, along with Pol/Econ FSN Specialist Christian </p><p>O. Goebel. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
