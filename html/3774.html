RANGOON 1069 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 767 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The UNDP is in a holding pattern in Burma as </p><p>it awaits both UNDP board and Burmese government approval for </p><p>its ongoing efforts in the countryside.  UNDP has no new </p><p>major projects on the drawing board, but wants more </p><p>flexibility in its mandate.  UNDP\'s relations remain somewhat </p><p>rocky with its new GOB point of contact, but we do not think </p><p>this is an issue which requires UNDP board attention.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>A Desire for More Flexibility </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) UNDP would like further flexibility in its </p><p>programming here, but will not make any specific requests for </p><p>new projects at the UNDP board meeting beginning September </p><p>23.  UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Akiko Suzaki and </p><p>Assistant Resident Representative David Dallah told us that </p><p>in the upcoming year the UNDP here would focus on carrying </p><p>out existing grassroots programs, and implementing </p><p>agricultural and socio-economic assessments that the board </p><p>approved in concept last year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ms. Suzaki and Mr. Dallah repeated their complaint </p><p>(see Ref B) that the UNDP is unable to work efficiently here </p><p>because of its mandate\'s restrictions regarding cooperation </p><p>with government authorities.  They said that the recent UN </p><p>review of UNDP\'s Burma activities concluded that the UNDP\'s </p><p>Human Development Initiative (HDI) program here would be far </p><p>more cost effective if it were able to take advantage of </p><p>technical and professional staff resident in various Burmese </p><p>government ministries.  The UNDP representatives also said </p><p>that there are difficulties in coordinating actions with </p><p>other UN agencies which are permitted to work with and </p><p>through host government officials. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Though it does not plan to raise the matter during </p><p>board discussions of Burma, the UNDP is considering </p><p>preparation of a macroeconomic study aimed at advising the </p><p>GOB on ties between economic reform and poverty reduction. </p><p>This is a regional UNDP program, which the agency is </p><p>currently carrying out in China, Cambodia, Vietnam, </p><p>Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia.  The idea is to complete a </p><p>case study and then proffer policy recommendations to the </p><p>government, with the aim of building capacity within the </p><p>government and local "think tanks."  Though the UNDP </p><p>representatives stressed that this program was not conceived </p><p>locally, we expect that the UNDP office here asked </p><p>headquarters to include Burma in this regional program. </p><p> </p><p>Obstructionist "Shining Star" Sees the Light </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The newly appointed liaison for UNDP and UNICEF </p><p>activities, Minister for National Planning and Economic </p><p>Development U Soe Tha, is apparently easing his initial </p><p>bureaucratic stance toward UNDP projects.  U Soe Tha assumed </p><p>the UNDP portfolio in July 2002 (Ref A) at the expense of the </p><p>creative and more economically savvy Brigadier General David </p><p>Abel.  According to UNDP staff here, after a rocky start the </p><p>relationship with U Soe Tha has improved markedly.  Though </p><p>the Minister has not yet approved UNDP\'s activities for the </p><p>upcoming year, UNDP representatives are optimistic and </p><p>pleased that the Minister and his staff have become more </p><p>responsive.  The UNDP officials believe that someone higher </p><p>in the food chain has encouraged U Soe Tha to show progress, </p><p>and quickly. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: We think it unnecessary to raise during the </p><p>UNDP board\'s Burma deliberations the matter of U Soe Tha\'s </p><p>administration of UNDP\'s activities.  However, it might be </p><p>useful to urge the Burmese government to act promptly on </p><p>approval of UNDP\'s country projects.  UNDP staff here said </p><p>that a more aggressive intervention would have been welcome </p><p>in July, but now, they fear, any pointed criticism could have </p><p>negative consequences.  We will continue to monitor this </p><p>evolving relationship, especially as it impacts UNDP\'s </p><p>efforts to work with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
