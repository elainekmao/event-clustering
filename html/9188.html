<p>UNCLAS  ZAGREB 001546 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRM FOR TABITHA OMAN </p><p>BELGRADE FOR DAVID SALAZAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, HR, SR, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: APPLICATIONS FOR FY2003 AMBASSADOR\'S FUND FOR </p><p>REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 66319 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. We are pleased to submit two applications to </p><p>PRM,s Ambassador,s Refugee Fund Program aimed at providing </p><p>support to refugee communities.  The first request is to </p><p>provide resource support (totaling about 7,000 USD) to a </p><p>community center and primary school in Centingrad, a town </p><p>with a sizeable Muslim population, many of whom are returnees </p><p>to Croatia.  The second request is to provide various types </p><p>of medical/surgical equipment to Knin hospital (totaling </p><p>about 13,000 USD), which provides important medical services </p><p>to thousands of refugees who have returned to the area.  We </p><p>have visited the community center and school in Centingrad, </p><p>which is currently under construction by a joint team of U.S. </p><p>and Croatian military officers and the Knin hospital in </p><p>recent weeks.  An Embassy panel, chaired by the DCM, </p><p>determined that these projects, out of a list of twelve, were </p><p>the ones where PRM funds would have the greatest impact on </p><p>refugee returns and the community at large.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Panel Selects Projects for PRM Program </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Following extensive research on a dozen projects submitted </p><p>for consideration for PRM,s Ambassador,s Fund Program, the </p><p>DCM recently convened a panel to review the list of proposed </p><p>projects and to make final selections.  Panel members agreed </p><p>that supporting the projects in the town of Centingrad and in </p><p>the city of Knin would yield the most benefit.  Both are </p><p>projects that will benefit refugee populations and the entire </p><p>community at large.  They will continue to support </p><p>reconciliation efforts that are underway.  In addition, both </p><p>are very specific in nature and will require little effort </p><p>with implementation.  Post has reviewed and confirmed the </p><p>estimated prices of the equipment that has been requested, </p><p>and is confident that the prices will fit within the $20,000 </p><p>cap set by PRM.  Post will play a direct role in overseeing </p><p>the purchases and delivery of the requested items. </p><p>Background material on each project is provided below. </p><p> </p><p>A Muslim Community in Croatia </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. The town of Centingrad is located about two hours from </p><p>Zagreb by car.  The town, which consisted of 4,800 residents </p><p>prior to the war and had an ethnic makeup of 66 percent </p><p>Croat, 25 percent Serb, and 9 percent Muslim, was heavily </p><p>damaged.  Since 1998, refugee returns to the town have </p><p>increased as more houses are being reconstructed and </p><p>infrastructure is repaired.  The population now stands at </p><p>about 2,500, with Croats making up 78 percent of the </p><p>population, and Serbs and Muslims the balance.  Muslims are </p><p>now the second largest ethnic group due to an increase in </p><p>returns.  The town has received very little support from the </p><p>Croatian Government.  It has one of the largest Muslim </p><p>communities in Croatia. </p><p> </p><p>4. We recently met with the local Imam, Azim Durmic, and the </p><p>president of the school, Matija Stepic, who told us that the </p><p>two most important needs for the community were at the </p><p>primary school and community center.  The school in </p><p>Centingrad had been completely destroyed, forcing many of the </p><p>town,s almost fifty children to travel some fifteen miles to </p><p>attend school in a neighboring municipality.  But help is on </p><p>the way, primarily due to assistance from the United States. </p><p>The Imam boasted about the fact that USAID is providing some </p><p>assistance helping to restore electricity, and U.S. and </p><p>Croatian military personnel were currently reconstructing the </p><p>primary school.  Construction will be completed by August 1. </p><p> </p><p>5. Stepic told us that the school will need about 100 </p><p>compulsory school literature books, 3-4 computers, a </p><p>television, videocassette recorder, and sports equipment for </p><p>outdoor sports before it opens.  USG assistance with the </p><p>above-mentioned items would be appreciated.  We later visited </p><p>the construction site of the school and spoke with the U.S. </p><p>military commander in charge of the project who confirmed the </p><p>timeframe for completion.  The estimated cost of providing </p><p>the items the school requested is $6,000. </p><p> </p><p>6.  As for the community center, Imam Duric explained that it </p><p>is a place where all of the citizens gather to read or </p><p>complete paperwork for citizenship papers or to apply for </p><p>various types of social assistance.  Based in a three-storied </p><p>house, we noticed that the community center is indeed the </p><p>gathering place for adults and children.  The Imam said that </p><p>because of the various roles the community center plays, it </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>would be useful for it to have a medium-sized copier to </p><p>complete various types of paperwork and a television and </p><p>videocassette recorder so that the children could watch </p><p>various educational and other shows during summer months and </p><p>after school.  The estimated cost of these items is </p><p>approximately $1,000. </p><p> </p><p>Knin Hospital In Need of Help </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The city of Knin was the capital of the so-called &Serb </p><p>Krajina8 prior to the war.  During this period, Knin had a </p><p>predominantly Serb population and its hospital was considered </p><p>one of the best in Croatia.  However, the effects of the war </p><p>and the virtual neglect by the Croatian government since the </p><p>war have taken a severe toll on the hospital,s operations </p><p>over the past eight years.  Although the ethnic balance in </p><p>Knin has changed (it is now roughly 65 percent Croat and 35 </p><p>percent Serb after a significant infusion of Bosnian Croats </p><p>who were resettled in the region after Serbs fled their </p><p>homes), many Serbs are returning to Knin and the hospital </p><p>continues to provide services to all of Knin,s citizens. </p><p> </p><p>8. We traveled to Knin to meet with the manager of the </p><p>hospital, Anka Shihabi.  She told us that the hospital was </p><p>built twenty years ago and equipped to provide medical </p><p>services to 350 patients.  The hospital,s medical equipment, </p><p>infrastructure, and information technology was heavily </p><p>destroyed during the war.  There are four main departments -- </p><p>medical, surgical, gynecological, and pediatric -- currently </p><p>operating at the hospital.  The hospital currently has 140 </p><p>employees, including many Serbs, and has almost 100 patients. </p><p> In the gynecology department, over 300 women, many of whom </p><p>are returning refugees, from Knin give birth per year.  Other </p><p>refugees receive critical services including minor and major </p><p>surgery, from the hospital daily even though they are not </p><p>able to pay. </p><p> </p><p>9. Shihabi told us that the Knin hospital continues to be one </p><p>of the most important preconditions for sustainable return </p><p>and living in the Knin area.  This is because the hospital </p><p>also provides services to refugees in several other </p><p>municipalities outside Knin.  The next closest hospital is </p><p>located almost an hour away in Sibenik.  Shihabi indicated </p><p>that the hospital was in dire need of basic medical equipment </p><p>needed to perform various types of surgical procedures.  She </p><p>provided us with a list of about 40 pieces of equipment </p><p>ranging from various types of tweezers and scissors to </p><p>different types of scalpels.  She had received estimates for </p><p>the equipment, which totaled about $13,000.  Providing this </p><p>equipment would allow the hospital to continue to provide </p><p>services to all of Knin,s residents.  She noted that these </p><p>items were the most pressing need for the hospital and </p><p>appealed to the U.S. for help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRANK </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
