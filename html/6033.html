<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 000555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. "La Prensa"2/22 San Pedro Sula-based liberal paper, </p><p>carried a full-page story: "Effects of a War against Iraq </p><p>will be Less Dramatic for Honduras": </p><p> </p><p>The Honduran Private Council for Business, the Tegucigalpa </p><p>Industry Chamber of Commerce and the Forum for the </p><p>Strengthening of Democracy hosted a conference with Giovanni </p><p>Reyes, economist and Director of Development and Regional </p><p>Cooperation for the Latin American System. He was invited to </p><p>speak on "Economic Capacity for Central America to prosper </p><p>by liberalized trade during a possible war". </p><p> </p><p>"I don\'t think that the same economic problems will arise </p><p>because of a war as occurred after September 11, because the </p><p>circumstances are different.  And it will also benefit the </p><p>regional economy, if, as estimated, the war is not drawn </p><p>out, but rather as the U.S. intends, the conflict ends as </p><p>soon as possible". </p><p> </p><p>"I do not discount that this conflict could have an impact </p><p>on the commercial value of Central American products -- that </p><p>is why farmers and governments should plan to export less </p><p>bulk coffee and switch the industry to processed coffee </p><p>because it offers added value. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Also in daily "La Prensa"- 2/18, an op-ed by regular </p><p>columnist Gloria Leticia Pineda:  "War and Peace": After </p><p>receiving a lot of e-mails, my conclusion is that pacifists </p><p>wouldn\'t be as fanatically opposed as they are now if a </p><p>country other than the U.S. was the one calling for war- Why </p><p>do they have such sympathy and consideration for Saddam </p><p>Hussein?  There are sincere people that seek peace to avoid </p><p>harm to people, but at the present, there are a lot of </p><p>hypocrites pretending that they are neutral.  There are many </p><p>people in America and Europe who are opposed for acceptable </p><p>reasons, but there are also a lot of countries that envy the </p><p>United States and would like to see it on its knees.  But </p><p>what do Honduras and the world gain with a United States on </p><p>its knees?  History has not taught us anything: there were </p><p>no seriously coordinated efforts to stop Hitler and the </p><p>world paid a high price in blood. </p><p> </p><p>"The dream of peace is not an easy thing to achieve.  A </p><p>Syrian runs the presidency of the United Nations Council. </p><p>Libyan has a high position as the leader of the committee on </p><p>"Defense of Human Rights."  These nations do not view the </p><p>U.S neutrally; both Syria and Libya are under suspicion of </p><p>being terrorist countries.  Besides, Hussein is not an </p><p>educated man such as Alejandro I (King), and the United </p><p>States won\'t leave its military forces to die of illness as </p><p>Napoleon did to his eighty thousands soldiers.  Already U.S. </p><p>medical doctors have been sent to the war zone.  Only a </p><p>miracle can stop this war. Pray for it. </p><p> </p><p>3. TV talk show "Frente a Frente" 2/25 - Renato Alvarez, </p><p>director and anchor, at the beginning of an interview with </p><p>Narcis Serra, a European socialist leader and a former </p><p>Minister of Defense and the former Vice President of Spain </p><p>during the administration of Felipe Gonzales, quoted </p><p>Secretary of State Powell as saying made recently during his </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>trip to Asia that with or without the United Nation\'s </p><p>blessing, the U.S. will go to war against Iraq.  Serra </p><p>commented: "The Spanish government\'s recent decision to </p><p>support the U.S. in an invasion of Iraq is only the </p><p>government\'s position not that of the Spanish people.  They </p><p>have held strikes, because they do not want a war. </p><p> </p><p>"Without any doubt Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed - </p><p>because we cannot allow a country that invaded Kuwait and </p><p>prosecuted a bloody war with Iran resulting in thousands and </p><p>thousands of victims.  This country must not have </p><p>destructive and dangerous weapons, but during the Gulf War a </p><p>great number of Iraq\'s military weapons were destroyed, and </p><p>since then more weapons have been deactivated and destroyed. </p><p>Why not continue with an inspection system that guarantees </p><p>the international world that this problem is under control </p><p>without declaring a war, because a war means thousands of </p><p>civilian and military casualties, and it will provoke the </p><p>feeling of humiliation that the Islam world feels toward the </p><p>U.S.  Why not continue with a method that maintains this </p><p>country under control without a war. </p><p> </p><p>4. Another "Frente a Frente" talk show invited Ambassador </p><p>Rafael Leiva Vivas, Director of the Diplomatic Academy of </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Dr. Jose Maria Leiva, a </p><p>university professor of International Relations, to analyze </p><p>and evaluate a possible U.S. and Iraqi conflict. </p><p> </p><p>After both commentators discussed historical issues of past </p><p>wars and conflict, they discussed the possibility of war </p><p>between the U.S. and Iraq based in many respects on articles </p><p>provided by PAS to both the invitees and the journalist. </p><p>Rafael Leiva Vivas commented that the U.S has the right of </p><p>self-defense as it is established under the rules of the </p><p>United Nations because they were attacked by terrorists. </p><p> </p><p>5. Many other TV and Radio stations also have used the </p><p>Washington File as supporting documents when they have </p><p>commented on the conflict or when they have invited experts </p><p>to talk about the U.S. and its allies. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
