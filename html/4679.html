REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z </p><p>1.  (C) HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS </p><p>TAURAN CALLED IN AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 27 TO CONVEY THE POPE\'S </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THE ISRAELI REOCCUPATION OF BETHLEHEM.  WITH THE CHRISTMAS </p><p>SEASON APPROACHING, TAURAN SAID THE CURRENT CURFEW IN </p><p>BETHLEHEM -- PROJECTED TO LAST THROUGH DECEMBER 30 BY SOME </p><p>ISRAELI AUTHORITIES -- WOULD HAVE VERY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. </p><p>HE INDICATED THAT IF THE CURFEW WAS NOT LIFTED AND ACCESS TO </p><p>THE HOLY SITES GUARANTEED, THE POPE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO </p><p>MAKE A STATEMENT SHARPLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL FOR RESTRICTING </p><p>THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  TAURAN WELCOMED THE PROPOSAL FOR A </p><p>QUARTET MEETING IN WASHINGTON DECEMBER 20, ADDING THAT IT WAS </p><p>TIME TO MOVE FROM ANALYSIS TO CONCRETE STEPS ON THE GROUND. </p><p>HE ALSO APPLAUDED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DECISION NOT TO MOVE THE </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, WHICH HE SAID WOULD HAVE BEEN A </p><p>CAUSE OF "GREAT DISTURBANCE."  ON IRAQ, TAURAN TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THE HOLY SEE HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT REITERATING THEIR BELIEF THAT SADDAM MUST MEET HIS </p><p>UN COMMITMENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>POPE WANTS END TO CURFEW, ENSURE CHRISTMAS ACCESS TO HOLY </p><p>SITES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ARCHBISHOP TAURAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 27 THAT </p><p>THE POPE WAS PERSONALLY DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOST </p><p>RECENT ISRAELI INCURSION INTO BETHLEHEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS </p><p>OF THE ONGOING CURFEW THERE FOR THE UPCOMING CHRISTMAS </p><p>SEASON.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT ISRAEL HAD PULLED BACK ITS </p><p>TANKS FROM AROUND THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY, TAURAN SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z </p><p>BETHLEHEM REMAINED UNDER A STRICT CURFEW THAT HAD SERIOUS </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS EVENTS AT THE HOLY </p><p>SITES.  HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME ISRAELI AUTHORITIES HAD </p><p>SUGGESTED THE CURFEW COULD LAST UNTIL DECEMBER 30. </p><p>RHETORICALLY ASKING, "WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS," TAURAN SAID THAT </p><p>IF THE CURFEW WERE TO CONTINUE THROUGH THAT TIME, THE POPE </p><p>WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>ISRAELIS FOR "RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION."  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD BE LIKELY TO PROVOKE A </p><p>POINTED ISRAELI REACTION, AND WOULD STRONGLY PREFER THAT </p><p>STEPS BE TAKEN TO AVOID THIS SCENARIO.  TAURAN SAID HE HOPED </p><p>THE U.S. COULD WORK WITH ISRAEL TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS DURING </p><p>THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGREED TO CONVEY TAURAN\'S CONCERNS TO </p><p>WASHINGTON.  HE NOTED THAT ISRAEL WAS CERTAINLY SEEKING TO </p><p>AVOID A REOCCURRENCE OF THE OCCUPATION OF THE CHURCH OF THE </p><p>NATIVITY, AND ASKED TAURAN WHETHER THEY PERCEIVED A RISK THAT </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS MIGHT SEEK TO CREATE TROUBLE IN THE HOLY </p><p>SITES.  TAURAN SAID HE DOUBTED THE PALESTINIANS WOULD OCCUPY </p><p>THE CHURCH AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH </p><p>WOULD BE TOO GREAT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>QUARTET:  TIME FOR CONCRETE STEPS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD TAURAN THAT THE QUARTET WOULD BE </p><p>MEETING IN WASHINGTON DECEMBER 20 TO CONTINUE WORKING ON A </p><p>ROADMAP TOWARD ACHIEVING THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION OF A </p><p>TWO-STATE SOLUTION.  HE NOTED THAT CONTINUED VIOLENCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z </p><p>THREATENED TO DERAIL THESE EFFORTS, AND THAT PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>ISRAELI RESTRAINT WAS NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION, ACHIEVE REFORMS, AND ALLEVIATE THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION.  TAURAN WELCOMED THE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>QUARTET, BUT SAID "THE TIME HAD ARRIVED TO MOVE FROM ANALYSIS </p><p>TO CONCRETE STEPS."  HE ALSO REPEATED HIS LONG-STANDING VIEW </p><p>THAT AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING OR MONITORING PRESENCE ON </p><p>THE GROUND IS NEEDED TO END THE SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE.  ONLY </p><p>SUCH A PRESENCE, HE EXPLAINED, WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO </p><p>WAS VIOLATING AGREEMENTS.  PRESSED ON THE COMPOSITION OF SUCH </p><p>A FORCE, TAURAN SAID THAT WAS NOT A MATTER ON WHICH THE HOLY </p><p>SEE COULD COMMENT.  TAURAN ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER A </p><p>RECENT STATEMENT OF PM SHARON DENYING THE POTENTIAL FOR TWO </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>JERUSALEM:  PRAISE FOR PRESIDENT\'S POSITION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) TAURAN APPLAUDED THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION NOT TO SHIFT </p><p>THE U.S. POSITION REGARDING JERUSALEM AS CALLED FOR IN THE </p><p>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.  HE NOTED THAT WHEN THE HOLY SEE </p><p>HAD HEARD THE INITIAL REPORTS OF THAT ACTION, THE POPE HAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6627 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05938  02 OF 02  111712Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------16203B  111712Z /75 </p><p>O 111521Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S-CKELLY, NEA, AND EUR/WE-MENNUTI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, IZ, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE CALLS IN AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY CONCERNS ON </p><p>MIDDLE EAST AND BETHLEHEM </p><p> </p><p>BEEN "UPSET AND PERPLEXED."  TAURAN NOTED THAT THIS "WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN A REASON FOR GREAT DISTURBANCE IN THE REGION." THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION WAS MADE </p><p>IN THE FACE OF CONSIDERABLE CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05938  02 OF 02  111712Z </p><p>IRAQ:  HOLY SEE TELLS SADDAM TO FLY RIGHT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) TURNING TO IRAQ, TAURAN SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS VERY </p><p>PLEASED THAT WAR APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN AVOIDED FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING.  RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEXT STEP WAS UP TO IRAQ, THE </p><p>HOLY SEE HAD RECENTLY SENT A MESSAGE TO IRAQ MAKING CLEAR </p><p>THEIR BELIEF THAT SADDAM NEEDED TO ABIDE BY THE UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS AND ALLOW THE INSPECTORS FULL ACCESS TO POTENTIAL </p><p>WMD SITES.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED TAURAN THAT THE U.S. DID </p><p>NOT WANT WAR, BUT THAT IT WAS UP TO IRAQ TO ASSURE THE WORLD </p><p>THAT IT HAD DISARMED AS REQUIRED.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THIS, </p><p>BUT STRESSED THAT WAR WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR </p><p>THE REGION, AND WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE "APPETITE FOR </p><p>TERROR" AMONG RADICALS IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FOLLOWING THE DISASTROUS OCCUPATION OF THE CHURCH OF </p><p>THE NATIVITY LAST SPRING, THE HOLY SEE IS DETERMINED TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THE CHURCH DOES NOT AGAIN BECOME CAUGHT IN THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CROSS-FIRE.  EVER CONSCIOUS OF THE </p><p>SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE OF THE HOLY SITES, THE POPE WOULD SEE </p><p>ISRAELI RESTRICTIONS THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON AS A SYMBOL OF </p><p>CONTINUED HIGH-HANDEDNESS AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE SHARPLY </p><p>CRITICAL IF THE CURFEW WOULD MAR THE HOLY SEASON.  ANY </p><p>ASSURANCE WE COULD PROVIDE THE HOLY SEE THAT WE ARE </p><p>ENCOURAGING ISRAEL TO ENSURE A PEACEFUL CHRISTMAS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05938  02 OF 02  111712Z </p><p>BETHLEHEM WOULD BE WELCOMED AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH, AND A </p><p>MUCH-NEEDED GLIMMER OF HOPE AT A TROUBLED TIME. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05938 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
