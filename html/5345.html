<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000213 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEW COUNTERNARCOTICS DECREE:  A RAY OF HOPE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  A new GVN decree may enhance international </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation and offer new hope for the long- </p><p>awaited conclusion of a US-Vietnam Counternarcotics </p><p>Agreement.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>COOPERATION IN PRINCIPLE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On January 21, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai signed </p><p>a new decree directing the GVN to coordinate with other </p><p>countries in counternarcotics activities, including </p><p>training, information sharing, and law enforcement. </p><p>According to media reports, PM Khai specifically directed </p><p>relevant ministries and other concerned agencies to enhance </p><p>their efforts in entering into bilateral and multilateral </p><p>counternarcotics agreements. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The decree (at least the excerpts that the GVN has </p><p>thus far publicized) is well caveated by usual language on </p><p>the need to "respect Vietnam\'s independence, sovereignty, </p><p>territorial integrity, and traditional customs."  In </p><p>addition, the decree noted that cooperation "must be based </p><p>on the laws of Vietnam." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>VIEW FROM MFA </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Bui Quan Minh, Senior Officer of the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs\' Department of International Organizations </p><p>Department (MFA/IO -- the USG\'s designated point of contact </p><p>for negotiating the long-delayed counternarcotics </p><p>agreement), told poloff on January 27 that the decree was an </p><p>"encouraging step" for enhancing international cooperation. </p><p>He warned, however, that "we will have to proceed cautiously </p><p>to ensure full compliance with Vietnam\'s laws and </p><p>sovereignty." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE UN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Dr. Doris Buddenberg, UN Office of Drug Control </p><p>(UNODC) Representative, predicted privately that the decree </p><p>would lead to a stronger role for the GVN\'s Standing Office </p><p>of Drug Control (SODC) as the GVN\'s focal point for </p><p>interacting with foreign entities on counternarcotics. </p><p>(Note:  SODC is roughly equivalent to the USG\'s Office of </p><p>National Drug Control Policy.  End note.)  Dr. Buddenberg </p><p>opined that this increased centralization could be "a good </p><p>thing," compared to the previous arrangement whereby several </p><p>ministries had their own channels for international </p><p>cooperation.  Dr. Buddenberg expressed doubt, however, that </p><p>the decree would have a "major impact" on USG efforts to </p><p>conclude the bilateral counternarcotics agreement, since </p><p>that "is firmly in the hands of MFA/IO."  While UNODC is </p><p>reserving final judgment until the full text is made public, </p><p>Dr. Buddenberg commented that the decree, while "helpful," </p><p>appeared "heavily weighed down" with qualifiers that would </p><p>"probably" limit its potential effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SODC\'S VIEW </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  According to SODC Director Colonel Bui Xuan Bien, </p><p>the decree represents one of the "concrete steps" required </p><p>under the GVN\'s "comprehensive" counternarcotics law that </p><p>was passed in 2000.  He cited an earlier decree that </p><p>designated the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social </p><p>Affairs as the GVN ministry responsible for drug treatment </p><p>as another "concrete" GVN action to implement the drug law. </p><p>Colonel Bien said that other decrees will follow as part of </p><p>the GVN\'s commitment to move from the general policies </p><p>described in the drug law to more specific implementation </p><p>activities.  Colonel Bien declined to predict how </p><p>specifically the new decree would enhance SODC\'s role, but </p><p>claimed that SODC "has always supported and will continue to </p><p>support" improved international and regional </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation.  "Vietnam cannot fight drugs </p><p>alone," he admitted.  Colonel Bien opined that the decree </p><p>"is likely to help push forward" the bilateral </p><p>counternarcotics agreement with the U.S., but noted that </p><p>negotiations are "out of SODC\'s purview," since the GVN had </p><p>designated overall negotiating responsibility to MFA/IO. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The decree is at the minimum a welcome step in the </p><p>right policy direction, even if caveated with Vietnam\'s </p><p>normal defensive principles.  While Embassy does not believe </p><p>that its entry into force will lead to any immediate </p><p>breakthroughs in our efforts over the CNA, its existence </p><p>nonetheless offers a new peg on which to urge the MFA/IO to </p><p>get off the stick and intensify efforts to convince other </p><p>ministries (i.e., Finance) to agree to the standard USG </p><p>draft text, and finally turn these long-standing </p><p>negotiations into a win/win situation for both the GVN and </p><p>USG. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
