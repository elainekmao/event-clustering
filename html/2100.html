ACCORDING TO GIANG, THIS MEANS THAT VIETNAM IS </p><p>MATURE ENOUGH AND PREPARED TO BE A FRIEND AND PARTNER TO </p><p>COUNTRIES "INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES."  HE EXPRESSED A </p><p>BELIEF THAT WHILE THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS ITS UPS AND </p><p>DOWNS, THE OVERALL TREND IS UPWARD.  NOTING HIS PERSONAL </p><p>STAKE IN THE BTA, ACQUIRED THROUGH WORKING ON IT FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS, HE OFFERED HIS OFFICE AS A POINT OF CONTACT IN TIMES </p><p>OF NEED. </p><p> </p><p>5.

NOTING THAT THIS BITTERNESS IS A "CHRONIC </p><p>IRRITANT" IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, GIANG SAID THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE EXCHANGES WERE QUITE </p><p>EFFECTIVE IN OVERCOMING THESE OLD TENSIONS.  HE CITED </p><p>INSTANCES INVOLVING BOTH OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE AND "AGENT </p><p>ORANGE VICTIMS" IN WHICH PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THEIR FORMER </p><p>OPPONENTS FOES BROKE DOWN OLD HATREDS.  GIANG CONTRASTED THE </p><p>PATH OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM TO THOSE OF POST-WORLD </p><p>WAR II GERMANY OR JAPAN, OBSERVING THAT IN THE US-VIETNAM </p><p>CASE, PEOPLE TEND TO "CLING TO THE PAST."  HOWEVER, HE TOOK </p><p>A FAVORABLE VIEW OF US-VIETNAM RELATIONS IN THE LONG-TERM </p><p>COMPARED WITH THOSE BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CHINA, CITING WHAT </p><p>HE SAID WAS A FAVORITE SAYING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE: "HEY GUYS, </p><p>WHEN THE WESTERNERS LEAVE, THE CHINESE WILL COME AGAIN." </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
