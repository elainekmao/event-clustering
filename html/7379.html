<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ELECTION UPDATE - WILL THEY BE READY? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 502 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The April 12 National Assembly </p><p>elections, to a significant degree, will be a dry-run </p><p>for the presidential election one week later. The </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) </p><p>claims it is ready to conduct the election.  This </p><p>cable provides an overview of INEC\'s preparation.  At </p><p>this late stage, the lapses with voters registration </p><p>are irrevocable.  However, INEC\'s calculation of the </p><p>number of registered voters continue to undergo close </p><p>scrutiny (septel).  Starting April 8, INEC began </p><p>issuing voter cards and appeared seriously to tackle </p><p>the massive logistical challenges of positioning </p><p>material and personnel for election day.  There will </p><p>likely be foul-ups in the stationing of personnel and </p><p>materials on election day.  Confusion over who is or </p><p>is not a registered voter will also hamper balloting </p><p>in many places.  Hopefully these gaps will not be too </p><p>numerous and INEC will acquit itself well on April 12. </p><p>A responsible performance will lower the political </p><p>temperature and create greater confidence that the </p><p>April 19 Presidential election will be handled </p><p>credibly.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MATERIAL ISSUES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) INEC now has almost all required materials in </p><p>country, but has only started to distribute the </p><p>material to Local Government Areas (LGAs).  Some LGAs </p><p>may not receive materials in time to begin the voting </p><p>at 0800 on Saturday, April 12.  The number of polling </p><p>officials is also a concern.  With over 120,000 </p><p>polling stations nationwide and an average of five </p><p>officials per station, INEC must employ hundreds of </p><p>thousands of ad hoc personnel, many of whom may have </p><p>received little training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The voter card exchange, supposed to run from </p><p>April 8 through April 10, has started in some areas. </p><p>This process consists of changing the temporary voter </p><p>slip given at voter registration for a card to be used </p><p>on election day.  INEC Chairman Abel Guobadia has </p><p>announced that people who did not receive the voter </p><p>card would be able to make the exchange at the voting </p><p>booth the day of the election.  (COMMENT: INEC\'s </p><p>statements regarding the voter cards have been vague </p><p>and unclear.  The decision to provide voter cards at </p><p>the voting booth will likely complicate and confuse </p><p>the election day process in many voting stations. END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) INEC has released posters showing sample </p><p>ballots and specimens have also been printed in many </p><p>local daily newspapers.  In addition to the standard </p><p>ballot, tendered ballots are allowed by Nigeria\'s </p><p>Electoral Law.  A tendered ballot is one given to </p><p>people whose name does not appear on the register or </p><p>are otherwise disqualified from voting, but these </p><p>ballots will not be counted.  Tendered ballots are </p><p>required by the Electoral Law to be a different color </p><p>from the standard ballot, but INEC has not prepared </p><p>any formal tendered ballots.  Tendered ballots will </p><p>simply be marked with a "T" by polling officials at </p><p>the time of voting.  (COMMENT: The use of tendered </p><p>ballots to ease the frustration of otherwise </p><p>ineligible voters by letting them "participate" is </p><p>laudable.  However, the system INEC has devised is </p><p>short on controls and susceptible to manipulation. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) INEC has stated that elections will not be held </p><p>in areas of violence, or even potential violence. </p><p>Thus, it is likely INEC will not hold elections in </p><p>Local Government Areas in Warri due to the ongoing </p><p>crisis in that part of Delta State.  INEC also </p><p>declared the need for "special security requirements" </p><p>in six states where INEC experienced problems during </p><p>the voter registration period.  These states are </p><p>Bayelsa, Delta, Plateau, Nassarawa, Rivers and Taraba. </p><p>Additional security measures to deal with the </p><p>potentially troubled areas have not been described. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>IN THE COURTS </p><p>------------- </p><p>6. (C) The Federal High Court in Abuja was scheduled </p><p>to rule April 10 on the suit filed against INEC for </p><p>allegedly violating the Electoral Law by not </p><p>displaying the voters registration lists 60 days </p><p>before the election.  COMMENT: The court might likely </p><p>rule in favor of INEC.  Conversely, if the court rules </p><p>that INEC violated the law, the ruling still might </p><p>allow for the election to proceed.  However, an </p><p>adverse ruling calling for postponement of the </p><p>election is possible, although, at this stage, not </p><p>very likely.  Whatever the court rules, the losing </p><p>party will appeal.  Litigation has been an ongoing </p><p>problem in the election process, adding confusion and </p><p>delays, and will continue well past the elections </p><p>themselves. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MONITORING THE SITUATION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Realistic expectations put the number of </p><p>domestic monitors at roughly 30,000 people, mostly </p><p>from the four organizations including the Transition </p><p>Monitoring Group and the JDPC.  Unfortunately, this </p><p>number will not provide universal coverage of polling </p><p>stations.  Moreover, coordination among the domestic </p><p>groups is rare and has been marked by bickering. </p><p>International monitors will exceed 150, mainly from </p><p>the EU, the Commonwealth, IRI and NDI.  The Mission </p><p>will be fielding more than 20 officers to polling </p><p>places in ten different states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: The April 12 elections are important </p><p>in and of themselves. But for many Nigerians their </p><p>real value is that they provide an indication of INEC </p><p>preparedness for the big contests - the April 19 </p><p>gubernatorial and presidential elections.  There will </p><p>be glitches and some polling areas will not open on </p><p>time, and certainly not end on time.  Nigerians expect </p><p>a rough-hewn process.  In the end, INEC will not be </p><p>judged so much by the glitches that occur, but by how </p><p>quickly and impartially it handles them.  To a large </p><p>degree, the success of these elections will depend on </p><p>the ability of polling officials to resolve issues as </p><p>they arise at the individual polling stations and on </p><p>the integrity of senior INEC officials to safeguard </p><p>the sanctity of the vote tabulation process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
