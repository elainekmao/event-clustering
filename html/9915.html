<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, JO, ENV </p><p>SUBJECT:  CPA Iraqi Mobile Telecom Tender Conference </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  CPA telecommunications officials held a </p><p>conference in Amman July 31 for prospective bidders on </p><p>licenses to provide mobile telecommunication services in </p><p>Iraq, attracting over 400 participants.  During the </p><p>conference, attendees expressed frustration over the short </p><p>bid submission period, a five percent cap on government </p><p>ownership for bidders, a perceived favoritism to GSM </p><p>technology, and a lack of clarity regarding selection </p><p>criteria.  Responding to these concerns, CPA officials </p><p>later extended the deadline and reissued a revised tender </p><p>on August 3.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>A CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>2.   (U) CPA telecom officials David Leech, Jim Davies, </p><p>William Lane, and Dr. Daniel Sudnick, along with Iraqi </p><p>Telecommunications and Post Company executives Abdul Latif, </p><p>Walid Jallo, Luma Badir and Shakir Abdullah conducted an </p><p>Iraqi Mobile Telecommunications Tender Conference in Amman </p><p>on July 31.  The conference attracted over 400 participants </p><p>from global telecommunications and consulting firms and </p><p>featured presentations on the future of communications in </p><p>Iraq, the Iraqi Telecommunications and Posts Company, and </p><p>the bid submission process.  From the onset of the </p><p>conference, CPA officials declared their intention to use </p><p>the forum for an exchange of ideas between the private </p><p>sector and the CPA telecommunications team regarding the </p><p>mobile tender, and future decisions regarding the Iraqi </p><p>telecommunications arena. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) According to the tender, three licenses are to be </p><p>awarded, one each in CPA-designated north, south, and </p><p>central regions, the latter including Baghdad.  The </p><p>licenses are for two years, with winning bidders required </p><p>to deposit a $30 million letter of credit with the CPA </p><p>pending the achievement of service benchmarks six months </p><p>after the contract is awarded.  Successful bidders also </p><p>must pay a license fee ranging from $ 1.33 to $2.08 million </p><p>USD depend on their region to fund a future regulatory </p><p>agency.  Successful bidders have 20 days following the </p><p>award of the contract to begin installing their </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) However, the most controversial part of the tender </p><p>was a clause which restricted bidders to those with no </p><p>larger than five percent ownership by foreign governments, </p><p>leading to concerns on the part of conference participants </p><p>that almost all Arab telecommunications firms would be </p><p>excluded from the bidding.  CPA officials explained that </p><p>the Iraqi telecommunications officials wanted to avoid </p><p>substantial foreign ownership of Iraqi infrastructure, but </p><p>agreed to take attendee comments into account when </p><p>considering possible revisions of the tender document, an </p><p>examination they pledged to conduct. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ROOM FOR CDMA? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Several CDMA technology providers expressed to </p><p>Econoff their frustration with the relegation of CDMA to </p><p>the 800 MHz block of the spectrum, stressing that operation </p><p>in this band would be secondary to military use and would </p><p>cause degradation in quality of service.  CPA officials </p><p>explained that they were restricted by previous ITU </p><p>agreements and were unable to free up additional spectrum. </p><p>However, they stated that CDMA technology could provide a </p><p>quality mobile service even with the restrictions and </p><p>encouraged CDMA providers to compete.  (Note:  On the </p><p>margins of the conference, CPA officials told EconOff that </p><p>they did not expect any CDMA bids. End Note) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>RULES OF THE GAME </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>6. (SBU) During a Q and A session, potential bidders asked </p><p>CPA officials to provide quantitative selection criteria </p><p>for the tender in order to know how to structure their bids </p><p>in a way that increases their chances of success.  Leech </p><p>said that decision-making criteria included area coverage, </p><p>subscriber capacity, speed of rollout, roaming capability </p><p>and the cost to end user, but would not specify how each of </p><p>these areas would be weighed.  He said a five-person </p><p>selection committee would examine bids and favor those that </p><p>took into account the social and cultural needs of the </p><p>Iraqi people.  While the factors that comprise such needs </p><p>were not specified, they implied that the inclusion of </p><p>Iraqi companies and employees into bidding consortia would </p><p>increase the chances of winning the tender.  (Note: The CEO </p><p>of Jordanian mobile company Fastlink, Mr. Mohammed Saqer, </p><p>told Econoff that many of his Arab counterparts assumed </p><p>that the contracts would be given to Vodaphone, Orascom and </p><p>one unspecified American company.  Furthermore, he added </p><p>that his consortium would submit a bid, not because they </p><p>felt they would win, but as a political statement that </p><p>tests the transparency of the CPA decision-making process. </p><p>End Note) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>IRAQI TELECOM PLAYERS UNITE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>7.  (U) A group of 60 Iraqis announced the formation of an </p><p>Iraq Telecommunication Corporation (ITC), which they hope </p><p>to operate as a public telephone company.  The ITC </p><p>expressed its desire to participate in tender selection </p><p>process.  While the composition and long-term intention of </p><p>the group is unknown, the CPA warmly received the group as </p><p>the type of private sector initiative that is needed in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THE CPA LISTENS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) On August 3, the CPA reissued a revised tender </p><p>incorporating many of the suggestions made during the </p><p>conference.  Changes included an increased cap on foreign </p><p>government ownership to ten percent, further clarification </p><p>on performance reviews, timeline and requirements for </p><p>obtaining a national license, removal of required </p><p>experience in multiple countries with at least five </p><p>previous contracts, inclusion of a bond payments once </p><p>license is awarded, confidentiality of bids, termination </p><p>rates for fixed-line calls, regional license fees per </p><p>region, and evaluation criteria.  The CPA also extended the </p><p>deadline for submission by one week until August 21, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------------- </p><p>9.  (SBU) Citing prohibitive foreign ownership caps, the </p><p>two-year license term, and the choice of the 800MHz </p><p>spectrum status, many potential bidders claimed that the </p><p>outcome of the tender process was predetermined.  Although </p><p>participants were encouraged by the CPA\'s willingness to </p><p>accommodate private sector concerns, many still expressed </p><p>skepticism that substantial changes would be made.   At any </p><p>rate, the Iraqi mobile telecommunications license tender </p><p>marks the beginning of what will be a long, contentious, </p><p>and occasionally difficult process to rebuild Iraq\'s </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
