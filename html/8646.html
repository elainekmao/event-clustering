<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003460 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE ROADMAP </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, June 10, highlights </p><p>the fourth anniversary of King Abdullah\'s accession to </p><p>the throne of the Hashemite Kingdom.  Other lead </p><p>stories highlight continued confrontations between the </p><p>Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as resistance </p><p>attacks in Falujah in Iraq, killing three American </p><p>soldiers.  A number of inside pages in all papers are </p><p>dedicated to preparations for the upcoming Jordanian </p><p>parliamentary elections, scheduled for June 17. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A calculated resistance move" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(06/10):  "The joint military operation at the </p><p>checkpoint in Gaza sought to confirm the right to </p><p>resistance, as Palestinian factions are finalizing </p><p>their political confrontation with the government of </p><p>Abu Mazen.  Yet, this operation does not entail any </p><p>political damage to the Palestinians, rather it </p><p>indicates the Palestinian factions\' understanding of </p><p>the difference between a military action that would </p><p>disastrously harm the Palestinians under the current </p><p>circumstances and a military action that would simply </p><p>confirm the legitimate option of resisting the </p><p>occupation..  Paralleling the negotiating efforts with </p><p>operations against civilians in Israel would be like </p><p>someone who picks up a rock and throws it on his own </p><p>foot, but striking against the soldiers of the </p><p>occupation would be parallel to the negotiations and </p><p>could then be linked to the principle of mutual truce </p><p>once the Israelis agree to it..  The American </p><p>intervention has reached a point that surprised even </p><p>Sharon and the ruling regime in Israel.  Appointing </p><p>Condaleeza Rice to follow up on the Aqaba summit and </p><p>the commitments of both parties means that the U.S. </p><p>President has placed his own weight behind this issue. </p><p>The situation cannot tolerate any mistakes on the </p><p>Palestinian part.  The latest military operation </p><p>remains within the acceptable boundaries, while it </p><p>sends the specific message of confirming the right of </p><p>resistance as long as Israel\'s intransigence and </p><p>brutality continue to exist." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Israeli war against the outcome of the Aqaba </p><p>summit" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/10) editorializes:  "As soon as there were signs </p><p>of a genuine breakthrough for peace following the </p><p>Aqaba summit, the extremist right-wing forces in </p><p>Israel started escalating its aggressive measures </p><p>against the Palestinian people..  Whoever is observing </p><p>the Israeli policies and measures after Israel\'s </p><p>reserved acceptance of the roadmap would conclude </p><p>without the shadow of a doubt that the Israeli </p><p>government, which had unwillingly accepted the </p><p>roadmap, is going to do everything in its power to </p><p>abort the roadmap.  Understanding these issues </p><p>dictates that the Palestinian side, authority, </p><p>government and opposition, must be quite alert to the </p><p>need of pulling in Palestinian ranks, maintaining </p><p>their unity and avoiding squabbles." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Bush\'s modified image" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Osama Sharif writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/09):  "In less than two months, the world saw two </p><p>opposite faces for U.S. President George W. Bush:  the </p><p>first as a man of war and the second as a messenger of </p><p>peace..  In a few weeks time, President Bush\'s image </p><p>was modified to meet the needs of his presidential </p><p>campaign managers.The important thing is to modify the </p><p>image of the President before the eyes of the American </p><p>voter, so that his early achievements are not limited </p><p>to waging wars and military confrontations." </p><p>-- "The roadmap and protecting the sacrifices of the </p><p>Palestinian people" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Hussein Abu Rumman writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/09):  "The variety of analyses for the outcome of </p><p>the Aqaba summit, and whether it would be successful </p><p>in revitalizing the peace process between the </p><p>Palestinians and the Israelis leading to the </p><p>implementation of the roadmap, largely depends on the </p><p>variety of expectations with regards to the honest </p><p>intentions and the credibility of declared positions, </p><p>particularly on the Israeli and American sides.  Yet, </p><p>analyzing the Aqaba summit must also be seen from the </p><p>viewpoint of the potential that the Palestinian </p><p>acceptance of the roadmap provides for rebuilding the </p><p>strategy of the Palestinian struggle on the short run. </p><p>This viewpoint stems from the general picture that </p><p>resulted from militarizing the Palestinian Intifada, a </p><p>process that had disastrous outcome not only for the </p><p>Palestinian Authority, but also for the Palestinian </p><p>society as a whole..  Militarizing the anti-occupation </p><p>peaceful resistance and the suicide operations that </p><p>targeted civilians in Israel have severely harmed the </p><p>image of the peaceful Intifada, and have led to </p><p>dubbing the Palestinian struggle with terrorism, </p><p>despite acknowledging their right to resist the </p><p>occupation with all means possible..  The Palestinians </p><p>are required to take advantage of and benefit from the </p><p>U.S. President\'s need to appear as a man of peace </p><p>after occupying Iraq, and from the commitments that he </p><p>repeatedly declared to help put an end to the </p><p>occupation." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
