<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 THE HAGUE 001545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AC/CB, NP/CBM, VC/CCB, L/ACV, IO/S </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISP </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR DD PMA-A FOR WTC </p><p>WINPAC FOR FOLEY </p><p>COMMERCE FOR BIS (GOLDMAN) </p><p>NSC FOR CHUPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, CWC </p><p>SUBJECT: CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC): WRAP-UP FOR </p><p>9-13 JUNE </p><p> </p><p>REF: NEW YORK 1306 </p><p> </p><p>This is CWC-66-03. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>Topics: </p><p>-- RevCon Reactions </p><p>-- Budget Consultations </p><p>-- ABAF </p><p>-- Counter-terrorism Working Group </p><p>-- Libya Inching Toward Ratification </p><p> </p><p>1.  There has been little commentary or discussion on the </p><p>RevCon. However, in general, the RevCon exceeded </p><p>expectations. Many delegations are eager to discuss how we </p><p>will pursue RevCon follow-up. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Three rounds of budget consultations were held 11-13 June </p><p>on Programs 3-6. The facilitator will hold one more round of </p><p>consultations, on 1 July, to cover Program 7 (Administration) </p><p>and any other outstanding issues.  Consultations will then </p><p>not resume until the end of August. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The ABAF session from 9-13 June was hampered by a number </p><p>of issues: a preponderance of non-experts on the board; a </p><p>draft budget document devoid of justifications, descriptions </p><p>of real program activity, and 2003 actual figures; and a </p><p>Technical Secretariat notetaker incapable of writing </p><p>comprehensible English for the draft report. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Counter-terrorism working group met 12 June to </p><p>discuss whether the Action Plans for universality and Article </p><p>VII implementation tasked by the RevCon might come under the </p><p>purview of this group. </p><p> </p><p>5. Libyan parliament has passed the necessary measures to </p><p>allow Libya to join the CWC.  The next step, according to the </p><p>Libyan charge, is to send the paper work to the FM. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>RevCon Reactions </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Since the end of the First Review Conference (RevCon) </p><p>there has been little commentary or discussion on the </p><p>Conference. In general, the RevCon exceeded expectations. </p><p>Many delegations came away with the sense that future work </p><p>had been enshrined in the two agreed texts.  They see the </p><p>RevCon as an impetus to further action and as developing an </p><p>overall action plan for the Organization. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Many delegations are eager to discuss how we will pursue </p><p>RevCon follow-up and it will be a topic at next week\'s WEOG. </p><p>DDG Brian Hawtin has told delegations that he would like to </p><p>see one over-arching RevCon follow-up "Action Plan".  Del has </p><p>expressed concern that such an exercise might allow a couple </p><p>delegations to hold hostage the two implementation-related </p><p>action plans tasked by the RevCon review document: on </p><p>universality and Article VII implementation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Overall there has been no negative feedback on, only </p><p>praise for, the RevCon in general as well as U.S. actions at </p><p>the Conference. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Budget Consultations </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The facilitator (Peter Beerwerth, Germany) held three </p><p>rounds of consultations 11-13 June on Verification, </p><p>Inspection Management and Operations, and International </p><p>Cooperation and Assistance.  Senior program directors (D-2 </p><p>level) continued to air their differences with management </p><p>decisions not to include their full requests in the draft </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p>10.  India has approached the facilitator to say that they </p><p>have problems with the increase in OCPF ("Other Chemical </p><p>Production Facilities") inspections under Article VI. </p><p>11.  The facilitator will hold one more round of </p><p>consultations, on 1 July, to cover Administration and any </p><p>other outstanding issues such as the Indian complaint. </p><p>Consultations will not resume until the end of August. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Del has been joined by others (South Africa, Iran, </p><p>Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Spain, Austria) in </p><p>asking for language in the budget document to justify </p><p>unfreezing four additional positions, and to elaborate on </p><p>what activities would be carried out in key areas such as </p><p>External Relations\' outreach for universality and </p><p>International Cooperation and Assistance.  There is virtually </p><p>no language at all in the current budget document in these </p><p>respects.  The new Deputy Director General, Brian Hawtin, has </p><p>now heard these pleas and acknowledged the requests.  The </p><p>Director for External Relations handed out a non-paper with </p><p>additional justifications, but it is unclear if his </p><p>rationales were cleared within the Technical Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>13.  With respect to the request to unfreeze a P-3 position </p><p>in the Legal Office, Del recommends we tell the Director </p><p>General to reassign qualified staff already on board to meet </p><p>the very considerable demand for additional legislative </p><p>implementation support.  Talented German national Ralf Trapp </p><p>who supported the RevCon documents preparation, and Canadian </p><p>Gordon Vachon who currently fills an unneeded Inspectorate </p><p>post unfrozen by the former Director General so as to give </p><p>Vachon a job, are natural candidates. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Director for International Cooperation and </p><p>Assistance confirmed that the Director General found an </p><p>additional 336,000 euros for ICA programs, as promised at the </p><p>last annual Conference, and these are being spent.  The </p><p>additional funds came entirely from keeping posts vacant. </p><p>The draft budget contains a general unsubstantiated statement </p><p>that funding for ICA remains inadequate.  The director added </p><p>orally that for 2004 "we have practically taken a step </p><p>backward in terms of what we can do." </p><p> </p><p>15.  India and Iran spoke to insist that the percentage </p><p>increase in the ICA budget exactly match the overall budget </p><p>percentage increase in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>16.  DDG Brian Hawtin appealed to delegations to avoid </p><p>micro-management and to lift constraints under the current </p><p>system that do not contribute to effective use of resources, </p><p>such as the constraints on transfers between Chapter 1 </p><p>(Verification) and Chapter 2 (Administration), and </p><p>constraints on regrading or shifting posts.  He referred to </p><p>broader structural problems such as the lag in Article IV/V </p><p>reimbursements because of the uncertainty about when this </p><p>money is going to come in. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and </p><p>Germany all told WEOG that their capitals would have great </p><p>difficulty agreeing to the proposed budget.  Germany points </p><p>out that the almost 9 percent increase includes three percent </p><p>just to fund turnover in implementation of the decision to </p><p>begin enforcing a non-career organization. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>ABAF </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The session from 9-13 June was hampered by: </p><p> </p><p>--    a preponderance of non-experts on the board; </p><p> </p><p>--    a draft budget document devoid of justifications, </p><p>descriptions of real program activity, and 2003 actual </p><p>figures; and </p><p> </p><p>--    a Technical Secretariat notetaker incapable of writing </p><p>comprehensible English for the draft report. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The UK and the Netherlands did not send experts, and </p><p>Germany, Japan and Italy were represented by non-expert </p><p>delegates.  Washington might consider approaches to these </p><p>capitals to urge that they support ABAF by providing </p><p>qualified financial experts capable of straightening out the </p><p>disarray that continues to characterize the OPCW\'s budget </p><p>process. </p><p>20.  The Director General made a strong pitch to ABAF to fund </p><p>consultants to enable him to "further the universal </p><p>geographic distribution of staff".  The Argentine delegate as </p><p>said that because the CWC is a security treaty, "major" </p><p>countries are pressuring the Director General to use such </p><p>consultants to remedy what they see as under-representation </p><p>by their countries among the senior staff of the TS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Counter Terrorism Working Group Meets </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  The Executive Council\'s Counter Terrorism Working Group, </p><p>under the chairmanship of Deloff, met on 12 June to hear a </p><p>report from Special Projects Director Sergei Batsanov on his </p><p>trip to the Security Council\'s Counter Terrorism Committee </p><p>New York on 15 May.  It also heard a report on a meeting of </p><p>the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) attended </p><p>by Irakli Beridze of Batsanov\'s staff, and discussed the way </p><p>forward in implementing the action plans on universality and </p><p>implementation of Article VII tasked to the TS and Executive </p><p>Council at the Review Conference. </p><p> </p><p>22.  In his presentation, Batsanov said little that was not </p><p>covered in Reftel.  Beridze reported that SECI, a regional </p><p>organization dedicated to combating trans-border crime </p><p>(Albania, Bosnia and Herzgovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, </p><p>Hungary, FRY of Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia </p><p>and Montenegro, and Turkey) had created an anti-terrorism </p><p>sub-group.  Beridze\'s pitch focused on legal compliance.  He </p><p>passed out to the Working Group a draft report of a SECI WMD </p><p>subgroup that had an item calling on member states to focus </p><p>on "harmonizing/ developing their legislation with the EU and </p><p>international legal framework in force, applicable to NBC </p><p>issues, on civil and penal aspects." </p><p> </p><p>23.  Delegations took note of the need for action plans on </p><p>universality and legal implementation.  The chair raised the </p><p>question of whether pursuit of those issues might be taken up </p><p>under a different facilitation, but no delegates expressed </p><p>particular interest in taking the EC\'s action on the issue </p><p>elsewhere.  The chair at the end asked the TS to provide its </p><p>thoughts on an action plan to the Working Group. </p><p> </p><p>24.  The chairman of the working group will seek to place the </p><p>counter terrorism issue on the agenda for EC-33 either as a </p><p>separate item or under "Any Other Business."  This will allow </p><p>the Council to task the Counterterrorism Working Group to </p><p>develop an action plan for both items in close consultation </p><p>with the TS.  Del understands that the TS will offer its </p><p>thoughts on an action plan in the DG\'s statement to the EC. </p><p>Del also understands that the TS is giving careful </p><p>consideration to sending small teams comprised of TS staff to </p><p>selected countries in the greatest need of assistance on </p><p>compliance issues such as Article VII as well as Article VI. </p><p> </p><p>25.  The Working Group is likely to meet again in mid-July to </p><p>review the action plans and make a recommendation on them to </p><p>the September Executive Council Session (EC-34).  Del would </p><p>welcome Washington thoughts on specifics for an action plan </p><p>that would involve the capabilities of the TS and member </p><p>states. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Libya Inching Toward Ratification </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. OPCW special projects director Sergei Batsanov advised </p><p>Del on 12 June that he had just met with the Libyan charge in </p><p>The Hague who told him that the Libyan parliament had passed </p><p>the necessary measures to allow Libya to join the CWC.  The </p><p>next step, according to the Libyan charge, is to send the </p><p>paper work to the FM.  It would take about a month, he said, </p><p>to complete the necessary paper work before they file papers </p><p>to join. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Kellogg sends. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
