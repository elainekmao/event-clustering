<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003308 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, IZ, LE, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MONITORING AND EVALUATING ICMC\'S HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN LEBANON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. EXUM/POLASCHIK E-MAIL 1/21/03 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1587 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Beirut cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  As requested ref a, Regional Refcoord monitored the </p><p>International Catholic Migration Commission\'s (ICMC) </p><p>humanitarian assistance project for vulnerable Iraqis in </p><p>Lebanon on May 13, 2003.  Report is keyed to questions </p><p>provided ref a. </p><p> </p><p>A.  On May 13, refcoord and Embassy Beirut poloff met with </p><p>ICMC Forced Migration Specialist Jim Kelly, Project Director </p><p>Thomas Vasseur and Caritas/Lebanon Migrants Center Director </p><p>Najla Chahda.  They also held a separate discussion with the </p><p>project\'s implementing team of one project officer, five </p><p>social workers and one unpaid student intern, focusing on the </p><p>social and economic conditions facing vulnerable Iraqis in </p><p>Lebanon. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Although ICMC was slow in starting the project (see para </p><p>D for details), it is now doing a solid job of providing </p><p>services to vulnerable Iraqis.  ICMC\'s new outreach to the </p><p>Iraqi community (previously limited to church-based referrals </p><p>among the Iraqi Christian community) has revealed a very </p><p>vulnerable, marginalized population without access to GOL </p><p>services -- and without many other sources of assistance. </p><p>With a current caseload of 60 families per week, ICMC should </p><p>meet its goal of assisting 900 families by the end of the </p><p>grant. </p><p> </p><p>C.  ICMC spent the first four months of this project </p><p>identifying office space and staff.  A new international </p><p>project director (Vasseur) began work on November 15, 2002, </p><p>while key locally hired staff -- including ICMC\'s first-ever </p><p>Muslim social worker in Lebanon -- began work in January </p><p>2003.  ICMC then conducted staff training and began work in </p><p>earnest in February 2003.  Due to unforeseen difficulties in </p><p>community outreach (see para D), ICMC\'s initial client base </p><p>was quite limited:  44 families in the first three months of </p><p>the project and 221 families by mid-May.  However, due to </p><p>ICMC\'s ongoing intensive outreach in the poor Beirut suburbs </p><p>of Hay El Selloun, Burj el Barajneh refugee camp (where many </p><p>poor Iraqis squat in homes abandoned by Palestinian refugees) </p><p>and now in southern Lebanon, ICMC is interviewing 60 cases </p><p>per week.  At the current rate, ICMC most likely will reach </p><p>its planned objective of 900 families by August 31.  As </p><p>outlined in the grant agreement, ICMC is providing outpatient </p><p>and inpatient medical care, as well as basic humanitarian </p><p>assistance packages.  Although ICMC provided primary school </p><p>tuition assistance early in the project, it only began the </p><p>planned informal afternoon school sessions in April 2003, due </p><p>to difficulties in identifying and recruiting qualified </p><p>teachers.  ICMC admits it did not submit the required interim </p><p>report on-time but claims it was submitted to PRM/C in April </p><p>2003.  ICMC has shared with refcoord only draft project </p><p>updates that included neither a detailed breakdown of </p><p>services provided nor any financial information. </p><p> </p><p>D.  As in the similar PRM-funded project in Jordan (ref b), </p><p>ICMC initially had a difficult time reaching out to the Iraqi </p><p>community and advertising its services.  Most Iraqis in </p><p>Lebanon lack legal status and financial resources and </p><p>therefore are either afraid or unable to seek assistance; </p><p>ICMC social workers report that many Iraqis lack even the </p><p>taxi fare to reach the Caritas center in downtown Beirut. </p><p>Although ICMC planned to conduct community outreach via an </p><p>Iraqi Project Advisory Committee (that would include </p><p>representation from the various Iraqi religious and ethnic </p><p>communities present in Lebanon), political sensitivities </p><p>precluded its formation.  ICMC instead sends its social </p><p>workers out into the community to spread word of the project </p><p>and identify prospective beneficiaries.  ICMC reports that </p><p>since it has begun field visits in earnest, its caseload has </p><p>tripled.  Its field work has proven somewhat dangerous in </p><p>southern Lebanon, where a social worker was detained by </p><p>Hizballah and accused of proselytizing. </p><p> </p><p>Separately, ICMC also seems to have gotten a slow start in </p><p>implementing the project due largely to its focus on helping </p><p>Caritas Lebanon identify new space for its Migrants Center </p><p>and implementing three other projects that were funded at </p><p>roughly the same time.  (The projects include an EU-funded </p><p>human rights for asylum seeker project; a G/TIP-funded safe </p><p>house; and a separate PRM-funded legal and social protection </p><p>project for non-Palestinian refugees, reported septel.)  ICMC </p><p>reports that it simply was unable to accommodate all four new </p><p>programs in Caritas\' existing office space. In addition to </p><p>space constraints, Embassy Beirut and refcoord suspect that </p><p>ICMC may have taken on more projects and funding than it </p><p>could handle. </p><p> </p><p>E.  ICMC currently has eight staff working on this project: </p><p>Kelly, Chahda and the project implementation team of one </p><p>project officer, five social workers and an unpaid student </p><p>intern.  Kelly and Vasseur (who left the project in late May </p><p>to work for the UN in Iraq) have shared the role of project </p><p>management.  Although Kelly initially planned to oversee the </p><p>project on his own, ICMC decided to bring in an additional </p><p>international employee (Vasseur) to manage this project after </p><p>ICMC was awarded several other grants at the same time.  ICMC </p><p>reports that only one half of one international salary was </p><p>paid by this grant, as stipulated in the cooperative </p><p>agreement.  Separately, ICMC has rotated the project officer </p><p>position between two individuals, who have been detailed </p><p>periodically to Syria to assist in the establishment of a </p><p>similar Caritas project there.  ICMC reports that the project </p><p>officer\'s salary has been paid with PRM funds only for work </p><p>performed in Lebanon.  The personnel appear to be fully and </p><p>gainfully employed. </p><p> </p><p>F.  ICMC\'s project is run from Caritas\' brand-new Migrants </p><p>Center.  The center is spacious and well-equipped with new </p><p>furniture and furnishings, all of which appear to be in </p><p>working condition.  Four offices were equipped and furnished </p><p>by this grant, and an acceptable inventory control system is </p><p>in place. </p><p> </p><p>G.  N/A </p><p> </p><p>H.  ICMC plans to seek funding to extend this project for an </p><p>additional 12 months, both to continue providing assistance </p><p>to vulnerable Iraqis and to help this particular group </p><p>prepare for a return to Iraq.  ICMC is in discussions now </p><p>with partners Catholic Relief Services and International </p><p>Orthodox Christian Charities to fold this particular project </p><p>(as well as the similar PRM-funded project in Jordan) into a </p><p>larger regional return plan.  Given the difficult </p><p>circumstances facing Iraqis resident in Lebanon (illegal </p><p>status, limited work opportunities and no access to GOL </p><p>services) as well as the Lebanese Government\'s likely </p><p>unwillingness to allow any local integration of this </p><p>population, vulnerable Iraqis will continue to need basic </p><p>humanitarian assistance as well as extra assistance in </p><p>planning their eventual return to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Although ICMC\'s implementation of the current project has </p><p>been far from perfect, refcoord believes that a 12-month </p><p>extension of this project would advance PRM\'s regional policy </p><p>goals.  There are very few NGOs in Lebanon with existing </p><p>Iraqi assistance programs and ICMC is therefore better </p><p>positioned than most to take on eventual return assistance </p><p>programs.  Rather than wasting months in start-up time with a </p><p>new NGO partner, PRM could benefit from the existing, </p><p>well-trained staff and infrastructure funded by this grant. </p><p>Strong words from PRM regarding ICMC\'s reporting </p><p>responsibilities hopefully would encourage ICMC to meet its </p><p>obligations in a more timely fashion.  Refcoord therefore </p><p>recommends that PRM favorably consider ICMC\'s proposal. </p><p>Embassy Beirut agrees that ICMC appears to have overcome its </p><p>slow start on this project and is likely to meet the project </p><p>goal of assisting 900 Iraqi families.  ICMC social workers </p><p>are establishing a credible track-record among the Iraqi </p><p>community and are well-positioned to provide assistance to </p><p>this group and prepare them for eventual return.  Embassy </p><p>Beirut supports Refcoord,s recommendation for a 12-month </p><p>extension of this project and strict reporting requirements </p><p>for ICMC. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
