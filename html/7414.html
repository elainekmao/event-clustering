This cable is the first in a series looking at </p><p>  issues related to higher education in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SCENESETTER: EDUCATION IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   Since independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has invested </p><p>  heavily in education, improving the quantity and </p><p>  quality of primary, secondary, and teacher training </p><p>  schools throughout the country.  The result was that </p><p>  Zimbabwe achieved the highest literacy rate in sub- </p><p>  Saharan Africa and has produced an abundance of highly </p><p>  qualified high school graduates. In an attempt to </p><p>  absorb the growing number of students finishing high </p><p>  school, the flagship University of Zimbabwe expanded </p><p>  its incoming class sizes and eight new public and </p><p>  private universities sprang up in major provincial </p><p>  cities.  At least 35,000 students are now enrolled at </p><p>  universities within Zimbabwe, almost 3% of the </p><p>  country\'s total population of 12 million people. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Profiles of the seven most important universities </p><p>  in Zimbabwe follow. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   University of Zimbabwe (www.uz.ac.zw):  Located </p><p>  on a spacious campus in Harare, the UZ is Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>  oldest and largest university.  Founded in 1952 as the </p><p>  University of Rhodesia, it became the University of </p><p>  Zimbabwe at independence in 1980.  About 18,000 </p><p>  students are enrolled at the university\'s 10 </p><p>  faculties, which include arts, agriculture, commerce, </p><p>  education, engineering, law, medicine, science, social </p><p>  studies, and veterinary science.  UZ houses the </p><p>  country\'s only law and medical schools and most of the </p><p>  country\'s accredited graduate programs. Its lecturers </p><p>  tend to be more senior, better researched, and more </p><p>  likely to hold a terminal degree than their colleagues </p><p>  at newer institutions.  Annual tuition varies by </p><p>  discipline but is currently around z$35,000 (US $26) </p><p>  per year.  On-campus housing is available for </p><p>  approximately 5000 students, but students complain </p><p>  regularly about the quality and price of the </p><p>  accommodations.  Many are known to "sub-let" their </p><p>  dorm rooms to additional illegal roommates in order to </p><p>  save money.  Food service at UZ has been privatized </p><p>  and students are also unhappy with the price and </p><p>  quality of food.  Many students say that they can only </p><p>  afford to eat a proper meal once per day and that they </p><p>  survive the rest of the time on tea and "air pies" </p><p>  (imaginary food).  Students and staff are frustrated </p><p>  by the university\'s economic woes, as evidenced by the </p><p>  frequent neglect of routine maintenance on campus and </p><p>  shortages of supplies.  In 2002, for example, a final </p><p>  exam in chemistry had to be postponed because the lab </p><p>  could not procure enough test tubes for all students </p><p>  to complete the examination.  The University of </p><p>  Zimbabwe is supposed to have two terms per year, with </p><p>  the first term running from March to June and the </p><p>  second from August to November.  At present this cycle </p><p>  is off.  In February 2003, the Ministry of Higher </p><p>  Education closed UZ indefinitely in response to a </p><p>  strike by academic staff that began in November 2002. </p><p>  Faculty members are seeking a 135% wage increase, not </p><p>  unreasonable given Zimbabwe\'s inflation rate of 220%. </p><p>  Final exams from December 2002 are still pending and </p><p>  classes have not yet resumed as of April 2003.  UZ has </p><p>  traditionally been the most sought after and </p><p>  prestigious of local tertiary institutions, but many </p><p>  top students are now choosing to enroll elsewhere, as </p><p>  they fear that they will never finish a degree at UZ </p><p>  under current conditions. </p><p> </p><p>5.   NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>  (www.nust.ac.zw):  Established in 1991 in Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>  second-largest city, Bulawayo, NUST has become one of </p><p>  the nation\'s premier educational institutions.  Home </p><p>  to about 2700 students, NUST focuses on the sciences, </p><p>  engineering, architecture, and technological fields. </p><p>  The university administration has adopted a philosophy </p><p>  of growing incrementally and stressing quality over </p><p>  quantity, both in terms of the number of buildings </p><p>  erected on its still-in-progress campus or when adding </p><p>  new subjects.  NUST was the first university in </p><p>  Zimbabwe to require an industrial attachment </p><p>  (internship) for all of its students in order to </p><p>  graduate.  This was part of a strategy to foster ties </p><p>  with industry and to prepare students with practical </p><p>  skills that they will need on the job. Tuition at NUST </p><p>  is around z$36,000 per year and it operates on the </p><p>  American academic calendar of two semesters beginning </p><p>  in August and January.  Fewer than 100 students are </p><p>  able to live on-campus, as most of the planned </p><p>  residence halls have not yet been built.  Because of </p><p>  Zimbabwe\'s fuel crisis, students and staff alike have </p><p>  at times struggled to get to the NUST campus, located </p><p>  about 5 km outside of the Bulawayo city center.  NUST </p><p>  lecturers also went on strike in November 2002 seeking </p><p>  a 135% salary increase.  Classes were curtailed at the </p><p>  end of 2002 and final exams postponed, but most of the </p><p>  academic staff is back at work and classes are meeting </p><p>  again as of April 2003.  The salary issue has yet to </p><p>  be resolved though, so the threat of another strike </p><p>  still hangs in the air. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Bindura University of Science Education </p><p>  (www.buse.ac.zw):  Bindura became a university in </p><p>  2000, but its roots lie in a teacher-training </p><p>  institute that for many years was supported heavily by </p><p>  Cuban funding and personnel.  Located in a small town </p><p>  about 100 km north of Harare, Bindura now has about </p><p>  600 students who pay about z$35,000 per year in </p><p>  tuition and fees.  The school has two terms per year, </p><p>  with the first running from March to June and the </p><p>  second from August to December.  As its name implies, </p><p>  Bindura specializes in training teachers in biology, </p><p>  chemistry, mathematics, physics, and environmental </p><p>  science.  Most Bindura students already have </p><p>  certificates from teacher training colleges and </p><p>  several years experience in the classroom and are now </p><p>  returning for a university degree.  Bindura is </p><p>  hampered by its small campus and lack of physical and </p><p>  material resources.  Its library is tiny, there are </p><p>  few computers available for student use, and lab </p><p>  facilities are inadequate.  Students in lab science </p><p>  courses now travel as necessary to Harare and use </p><p>  University of Zimbabwe lab facilities.  Bindura has a </p><p>  long-term plan to build a new campus nearby, but lack </p><p>  of funds has so far hindered the start of any </p><p>  construction.  Bindura faculty members have not joined </p><p>  the strike started by their colleagues at NUST and UZ </p><p>  and classes are proceeding normally. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Midlands State University:  Located in Gweru, a </p><p>  mid-sized town about 300 kilometers southwest of </p><p>  Harare, Midlands State (MSU) only became a university </p><p>  in 2000.  It has grown quickly and already has 4700 </p><p>  students, second in size only to the University of </p><p>  Zimbabwe.  MSU is following the typical Zimbabwean </p><p>  academic calendar, opening the school year in March </p><p>  and beginning a second term in August.  Students pay </p><p>  tuition of approximately z$35,000.  Midlands offers a </p><p>  wide range of subjects, including agriculture, </p><p>  commerce, and social studies.  Facilities are </p><p>  inadequate for the size of the current student body </p><p>  and the subjects being offered.  MSU has plans to </p><p>  build its own campus, but no ground has yet been </p><p>  broken, so classes are held on the grounds of the </p><p>  former Midlands Teacher Training College.  Academics </p><p>  at MSU tend to be younger and less experienced than </p><p>  their UZ or NUST counterparts.  They have not gone on </p><p>  strike or threatened to do so, and classes at MSU are </p><p>  proceeding as scheduled. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU): ZOU boasts an </p><p>  enrollment of almost 10,000 and offers a variety of </p><p>  subjects, perhaps the most popular of which are </p><p>  business, education, agriculture, and communications. </p><p>  Tuition varies by subject but the average is about </p><p>  z$33,000 per year.  Most ZOU students are working </p><p>  adults, many of them teachers in rural areas, seeking </p><p>  job advancement or a salary increase through a </p><p>  university degree.  ZOU is however better described as </p><p>  a correspondence school than a full-fledged </p><p>  university.  Instruction takes place through written </p><p>  self-study modules supplemented by occasional in- </p><p>  person meetings for tutorials and exams.  ZOU\'s degree </p><p>  completion rate is quite low and its degrees, though </p><p>  accredited, are not as well respected as those from </p><p>  other local universities. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   Africa University (www.africau.edu):  Africa </p><p>  University (AU) is a private school located 15 </p><p>  kilometers west of Mutare, Zimbabwe\'s third-largest </p><p>  city.  It opened in 1992 and is affiliated with and </p><p>  financially supported by the American United Methodist </p><p>  Church.  As its name implies, the campus hosts </p><p>  students from 20 countries across Africa.  There are </p><p>  currently about 1000 students enrolled and about 70 </p><p>  lecturers working in faculties of agriculture, </p><p>  education, management, and theology. AU has a modern </p><p>  campus, a first-class library and, on the whole, </p><p>  greater resources than other universities in Zimbabwe. </p><p>  AU follows the American academic calendar with </p><p>  semesters starting in August and January.  Tuition and </p><p>  fees per term for international students are US$2680, </p><p>  while local residents pay about z$150,000 (US $110). </p><p>  Africa University is a functional and growing </p><p>  university with a diverse student body and staff </p><p>  complement.  It is however, financially out of reach </p><p>  for most Zimbabweans. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SOLUSI UNIVERSITY:  Solusi University is a </p><p>  Seventh Day Adventist school with a student body of </p><p>  1200.  It is located in a rural area about 100 </p><p>  kilometers outside of Bulawayo.  Students may choose </p><p>  to study in the faculty of arts and sciences, </p><p>  business, or theology and religious studies.  Solusi </p><p>  follows the American academic calendar.  Tuition and </p><p>  fees per semester are z$249,00 (US $185) for </p><p>  Zimbabweans and US$1390 for foreigners.  The </p><p>  Government of Zimbabwe recognized Solusi as an </p><p>  independent degree-granting entity in 1994.  Prior to </p><p>  that date, Solusi students received degrees from </p><p>  Andrews University, another Adventist college located </p><p>  in Michigan.  The degree program with Andrews was </p><p>  phased out by 1998, but a special relationship still </p><p>  exists between the two schools, which includes </p><p>  material assistance, staff development, and faculty </p><p>  exchange. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Other Institutions </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Government of Zimbabwe plans to create two </p><p>  more fully-fledged universities in the provincial </p><p>  towns of Masvingo and Chinoyi.  In addition, Zimbabwe </p><p>  has a network of smaller diploma-granting tertiary </p><p>  institutions across the country, including polytechnic </p><p>  institutes, nursing colleges, and teacher training </p><p>  colleges.  These schools can best be compared to </p><p>  community colleges or vocational schools in the United </p><p>  States, as they cannot grant university degrees but </p><p>  rather provide practical training and job skills for </p><p>  particular trades. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
