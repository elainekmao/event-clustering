<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 07 ANKARA 009058 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: WOLFOWITZ AND GROSSMAN PRESS TURKS FOR SUPPORT ON </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson, reasons 1.5, </p><p>b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1 . (S) On December 3, Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz </p><p>and Under Secretary of State Grossman met with new Turkish PM </p><p>Gul, an interagency group chaired by MFA Under Secretary </p><p>Ziyal, Turkish Deputy Chief of Defense General Buyukanit </p><p>(DCHOD), leader of the opposition Baykal, and MND Gonul.  At </p><p>each meeting DepSecDef emphasized the urgency for clarity on </p><p>what role Turkey is prepared to play in possible military </p><p>actions in Iraq.  Specifically, DepSecDef noted that without </p><p>the imminent resumption of military-to-military talks, site </p><p>surveys of Turkish facilities, and site preparations, the </p><p>"Northern Option" would soon be out of the question. </p><p>DepSecDef noted the USG needed an answer by December 6 and </p><p>outlined the significant assistance package the USG was </p><p>prepared to provide should Turkey decide to become a full </p><p>partner.  GOT officials reiterated their redlines for an Iraq </p><p>operation and highlighted the potential risks to Turkey and </p><p>its economy.  Gul agreed to resume military-to-military </p><p>planning and to allow the U.S. to conduct site surveys of </p><p>Turkish military facilities.  However, he pleaded for </p><p>additional time on the more fundamental decisions concerning </p><p>Turkey\'s possible contributions, including site preparations, </p><p>troop lists, role of coalition forces, and Turkish </p><p>participation in the Northern Option.  The GOT took the </p><p>opportunity to underscore the importance of Turkey\'s </p><p>relationship with the EU and Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Prime Minister Gul </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) After congratulating Gul on his recent formation of a </p><p>new government, DepSecDef stated he and U/S Grossman were </p><p>sent by President Bush to Ankara to discuss Turkey\'s </p><p>potential contribution to preparations for possible military </p><p>action against Iraq.  Fully recognizing that PM Gul has been </p><p>in office only a very short time, DepSecDef underscored the </p><p>"real urgency" for a decision on the role Turkey would be </p><p>willing to play. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Noting that Turkey and the United States have had </p><p>good, detailed discussions on the matter since last July, </p><p>DepSecDef reminded Gul that President Bush has made no </p><p>decision on whether to go to war with Iraq.  The USG is </p><p>making efforts to resolve this crisis peacefully, but the </p><p>President is determined to have Iraq disarmed of its weapons </p><p>of mass destruction, "voluntarily if possible, but, if </p><p>necessary, by force."  The US, DepSecDef added, is asking </p><p>Turkey to be involved in the planning and preparation for the </p><p>use of force against Iraq.  The only chance for a peaceful </p><p>outcome is to build a determined show of force.  Military </p><p>force is the underpinning of our diplomacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Repeating what the USG has told Ankara it needs from </p><p>Turkey, DepSecDef reviewed several key requests: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Resumption of military-to-military planning talks; </p><p>- Permission to conduct site surveys and begin site </p><p>preparation of specified Turkish military facilities; </p><p>- Turkish participation in the development of the Northern </p><p>Option; </p><p>- Acceptance of proposed troop lists, including the role of </p><p>possible coalition forces such as the United Kingdom; </p><p>- Removal of constraints on Operation Northern Watch; </p><p>- Approval of overflight rights; and, </p><p>- Support, if necessary, against terrorists in Northern Iraq. </p><p> (DepSecDef noted the presence of several hundred suspected </p><p>terrorists in Khurmal.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) DepSecDef reemphasized the need to get an answer from </p><p>Turkey as the time is approaching when planning will have to </p><p>switch from preparing for both a Northern Option and a </p><p>Southern Option, to solely pursuing a Southern Option.  He </p><p>added that if the US acts militarily against Saddam Hussein, </p><p>it would do so with a significant number of other countries. </p><p>DepSecDef reiterated that Turkey\'s red lines on military </p><p>action against Iraq were also U.S. red lines: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The territorial integrity of Iraq would be preserved; </p><p>--There would be no independent Kurdish state; </p><p>--The rights and welfare of the Turkoman people would be </p><p>protected; </p><p>--Iraqi national control of Kirkuk and Mosul would be </p><p>retained; and, </p><p>--Iraqi national control of the nation\'s oil would be </p><p>retained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Turkey, DepSecDef stated, has much to gain by </p><p>participating in a military action against Iraq.  The </p><p>conflict would be less risky, shorter in duration, and less </p><p>economically damaging to Turkey\'s and the region\'s economies. </p><p> The potential for creation of a vacuum in northern Iraq </p><p>would be less likely.  The conflict\'s aftermath would be </p><p>easier to manage.  DepSecDef stated that the United States is </p><p>very aware of Turkey\'s concerns about the economic risks such </p><p>military action could generate.  For that reason, POTUS is </p><p>ready to work with Congress to provide a substantial </p><p>assistance package for Turkey.  If the US and Turkey go to </p><p>war against Iraq, this package would include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- $2 billion/yr for two years of some mix of Foreign Military </p><p>Financing (FMF) and Economic Support Funds (ESF), the latter </p><p>being synchronized with World Bank and IMF disbursements; </p><p>- $1 billion in oil to be donated by other nations; and, </p><p>- Up to $500 million in local procurement by U.S. defense </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) If Turkey commits fully, but war proves unnecessary, </p><p>the President is ready to ask Congress for $250 million in </p><p>FY04 assistance and hopes to augment that amount with another </p><p>$105 million.  That would be $175 million in FMF, $175 </p><p>million in ESF, and $5 million in International Military </p><p>Education and Training funding (IMET). Complementing this </p><p>would be closer cooperation on missile defense, greater </p><p>access to excess defense articles, and improvements to </p><p>facilities at Incirlik and Konya military bases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) DepSecDef warned that if Turkey declines this </p><p>request, a war against Iraq could last longer, making it </p><p>costlier and less certain about events in northern Iraq. </p><p>DepSecDef emphasized the U.S. need for clarity from Turkey on </p><p>its role in order to plan appropriately.  If not, planning </p><p>must focus solely on the Southern Option without Turkey. </p><p>DepSecDef asked for a decision by the end of the week, </p><p>December 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) PM Gul exclaimed "by the end of the week?!"  He </p><p>followed up by stating Turkey and the US have been strategic </p><p>partners for decades, and Turkey wants to continue and to </p><p>deepen that relationship.  However, the government had just </p><p>received its confidence vote, and it has only received two </p><p>briefings on this matter. "We have followed this issue but, </p><p>of course, it\'s different when you are in office," Gul added. </p><p> Moreover, many pressing issues are on the government\'s </p><p>agenda, including the approaching EU Copenhagen Summit and </p><p>Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Gul acknowledged that Iraq is led by a bad regime </p><p>that has caused great suffering.  He conceded that Iraq\'s </p><p>weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to Turkey and the </p><p>entire region.  "We know that war is not good.  It is to be </p><p>avoided, but we understand your points."  He added that </p><p>Turkey has historical roots in Iraq and that Turkish security </p><p>is directly affected by events in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) "To give a political decision, we need some time, </p><p>frankly speaking," Gul stated.  Time is needed to shape </p><p>public opinion.  Gul repeated twice again that Turkey can say </p><p>yes to the requests, but the government needs more time to </p><p>update itself on the situation, must go to parliament, and </p><p>must shape public opinion.  He stated that Turkey\'s fragile </p><p>economy is an issue with millions of unemployed.  Military </p><p>action against Iraq could damage progress underway in </p><p>economic reform.  He emphasized, "We will cooperate, we will </p><p>cooperate, but we need time to study as the new Foreign </p><p>Minister knows little and the new Defense Minister knows </p><p>little." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs Ugur Ziyal </p><p>intervened making two key assertions:  First, the offer </p><p>DepSecDef reviewed was not commensurate with the risks and </p><p>costs Turkey is being asked to bear.  Second, Turkey is </p><p>entering a decisive phase in its relationship with Europe due </p><p>to the approaching EU summit and current state of Cyprus </p><p>settlement negotiations.  "If we do not pass these two </p><p>hurdles (attaining a date for EU accession negotiations and a </p><p>resolution of Cyprus), the devastation will preclude our </p><p>ability to participate in an attack on Iraq.  We cannot give </p><p>you an answer before December 12, the date of the Copenhagen </p><p>Summit."  Ziyal added he had not briefed the Prime Minister </p><p>on the terrorist danger present in Khurmal, but if the issue </p><p>is terrorism, Turkey will of course be with the US.  PM Gul </p><p>interjected, "We will fight with you against all types of </p><p>terrorism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (S) DepSecDef stated the most urgent priority now is the </p><p>need to resume planning talks, to initiate site surveys, and </p><p>then to do site preparations.  The next major decision point </p><p>will be deploying troops to prepare for war.  The ultimate </p><p>decision point would be the decision to go to war.  If </p><p>diplomacy is going to be effective, we need to move forward, </p><p>he added.  Ziyal noted that the resumption of </p><p>military-to-military planning and site surveys could go </p><p>forward without parliamentary approval, after which the Prime </p><p>Minister agreed the military-to-military planning talks can </p><p>go forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (S) Ambassador Grossman stated that POTUS is putting much </p><p>effort forward to support Turkey\'s desire to get a date for </p><p>accession negotiations from the European Union -- "You can </p><p>count on us to press this line all through December 12." </p><p>Momentum is developing toward this goal due to progress in </p><p>Turkey\'s democratic reforms and progress in the Cyprus </p><p>negotiations.  Grossman urged the new Turkish government to </p><p>make a concrete commitment to the UN Secretary General\'s </p><p>Cyprus plan as a basis for agreement.  Doing so would </p><p>positively affect Turkey\'s prospects to attain a date certain </p><p>from the EU for accession negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (S) PM Gul responded that his government is talking to </p><p>Turkish Cypriot President Denktash.  He emphasized that </p><p>Turkey will inevitably join the EU, "That is our mentality." </p><p>When Turkey joins, he asserted, the EU will become more of a </p><p>world player.  Turkey\'s membership would send a message to </p><p>the Muslim world that being democratic is attractive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (S) DepSecDef added that it is "an incredible strategic </p><p>opportunity for the EU and I hope it doesn\'t blow it."  But </p><p>in practical terms, EU accession and Cyprus are tied. </p><p>Progress on the latter would be a huge step forward toward </p><p>the former.  It would enable the US to be even more helpful </p><p>to Turkey.  Closing the meeting, DepSecDef responded to </p><p>Ziyal\'s criticism of the assistance package, stating that </p><p>"the numbers may not be big to you, but they are big to our </p><p>government.  They represent a major Presidential commitment." </p><p> He urged the Turkish government not to go public with these </p><p>figures. The public line should be simply that: The United </p><p>States is ready to assist Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Roundtable Discussion at MFA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (S) Ziyal then hosted DepSecDef and Grossman at an </p><p>hour-long interagency meeting at the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs.  The meeting focused on the Turks\' proposal for a </p><p>bilateral standby fund intended to sustain market confidence </p><p>in Turkey\'s economy in the event of war with Iraq.  DepSecDef </p><p>agreed to explore the merits of the proposal.  Following </p><p>Ziyal\'s recap of DepSecDef\'s earlier meeting with PM Gul, </p><p>they discussed the Prime Minister\'s agreement to re-start </p><p>mil-mil planning talks and to permit site surveys of Turkey\'s </p><p>military facilities.  U/S Grossman had a long, follow-on </p><p>discussion with the MFA representatives about Cyprus.  He </p><p>argued that now is the best time to resolve Cyprus -- before </p><p>the EU decides on Cyprus accession December 12-13 -- and that </p><p>the GOT should simply sign the first two pages of the UN plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (S) Bilateral Standby Fund:  Ziyal opened the meeting by </p><p>asking Treasury U/S Oztrak to report on his assessment of the </p><p>economic consequences Turkey would face in the event of war </p><p>with Iraq.  Oztrak estimated the impact of an Iraq operation </p><p>in terms of the financing gap for 2003:  $47 billion best </p><p>case (short war) to $58 billion worst case (long war).  A </p><p>war, he predicted, would cause oil and natural gas price </p><p>rises, export decline, and loss of tourism and oil pipeline </p><p>revenues.  Psychological effects would lead to decreased </p><p>consumer spending, loss of tax revenues, and increased </p><p>government spending for social security and refugees. </p><p>Interest rates would rise 10% and the lira\'s exchange rate </p><p>against the dollar would fall by 28%.  Post-conflict </p><p>uncertainty would have a substantial impact on the economy. </p><p>Oztrak also mentioned indirect costs to Turkey such as an </p><p>economic slowdown in Europe which could dampen Turkey\'s </p><p>export trade.  He then boiled the factors down to three: </p><p>losses in revenue, increased expenditures, and limits on </p><p>access to financial markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (S) Both Oztrak and Ziyal argued for "early and </p><p>substantial" US financial support in the form of a "standby" </p><p>arrangement, mentioning a figure of $20 billion.  This, they </p><p>said, would be the best way to positively influence the </p><p>perception of the markets that the US would "not let Turkey </p><p>go down the drain" and that the Turkish economy would "stay </p><p>afloat."  Turkey would be allowed to draw on these standby </p><p>funds only to the degree it needed them -- less in the best </p><p>case and more in the worse cases.  Oztrak accepted Ambassador </p><p>Pearson\'s point that the Turks\' analysis had not factored in </p><p>any of the possible medium- to longer-term benefits DepSecDef </p><p>had outlined, such as an upturn in trade relations with Iraq </p><p>and other neighbors as well as increased tourism in a more </p><p>stable region.  Oztrak also confirmed to U/S Grossman that </p><p>Turkey much preferred that the USG control the escrow account </p><p>rather than negotiate a new IMF standby, which "would have </p><p>too many conditionalities." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (S) DepSecDef said the Turkish "standby" approach might </p><p>be an alternative to the President\'s package he had outlined </p><p>to the PM.  We could not do both. The problem was how to </p><p>devise a mechanism to mitigate negative market effects and </p><p>create a fund Turkey could draw on only as needed. </p><p>DepSecDef agreed with Ziyal\'s suggestion to open a "third </p><p>channel" (in addition to the existing political and military </p><p>ones) of economic experts to discuss the feasibility of the </p><p>Turkish approach.  Ziyal urged the US to begin its </p><p>consultations with Capital Hill on an aid package for Turkey </p><p>even as the economic experts talk, in order not to lose time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (S) Site Surveys and Military-to-Military Planning Talks: </p><p> Ziyal recapped the decisions reached in the PM\'s meeting: </p><p>"yes" to site surveys, and re-starting the mil-mil </p><p>discussions.  The PM understood the need to "impress" Saddam </p><p>visibly through overt cooperation.  Although Turkey </p><p>understood the urgency the US attached to a political </p><p>decision on furthering such cooperation, including stationing </p><p>US and possibly other coalition (possibly British) troops in </p><p>Turkey, Ziyal said that would be impossible before the </p><p>December 12 Copenhagen EU Summit.  The Parliament would have </p><p>to debate and approve any influx of foreign troops into </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (S) DepSecDef underscored the need to allow site </p><p>preparation teams into Turkey.  They would send a strong </p><p>signal to Saddam about the seriousness of the coalition\'s </p><p>resolve.  The US was prepared to spend $200-300 million on </p><p>needed construction.  LTG Casey said this could involve up to </p><p>6,000 engineers and logisticians.  TGS Deputy J3 MG Kalyoncu </p><p>said the GOT would have to study the "legal" aspects of </p><p>bringing in such large numbers of "foreign groups." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (S) The Growing Coalition:  In response to Ziyal\'s query </p><p>about the composition of the coalition, DeSecDef responded </p><p>that he knew of at least 23 NATO members and aspirants who </p><p>would be with us either unconditionally (16) or under another </p><p>UNSCR (7).  He thought France and Russia would also come </p><p>around.  In the Gulf region, most countries were committed </p><p>privately while saying otherwise publicly.  In response to </p><p>Ziyal\'s question, he admitted Egypt\'s and Saudi Arabia\'s </p><p>positions were less clear, but he thought they would end up </p><p>supporting any operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (S) DepSecDef warned again that further delay in Turkish </p><p>decision-making could sideline the Northern Option.  Planning </p><p>for the South was already far advanced.  While the site prep </p><p>teams could not actually start before mid-January, we need to </p><p>know now--before they start--that Turkey would indeed allow </p><p>US and possibly other coalition troops to come to Turkey. </p><p>The big decision on actual use of force could come later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (S) Finally, D/US for the Mideast Tuygan called attention </p><p>to the upcoming (13-15 Dec.) Iraqi Opposition conference in </p><p>London.  The Group of Six had become too powerful, to the </p><p>exclusion of the Turkomen.  Turkey insisted that the Turkomen </p><p>be included in the core group.  Ziyal later emphasized that </p><p>this is a critical concern for Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DCHOD Buyukanit </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. (S) USG Request for Military Support:  DCHOD stated the </p><p>TGS was very familiar with US military requirements as well </p><p>as with the discussion DepSecDef had earlier that day with PM </p><p>Gul.  The TGS will deliver a detailed brief on Iraq to the </p><p>new government on 9 Dec. 02.  The purpose of the TGS briefing </p><p>will be to help the government reach necessary political </p><p>decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (S) DepSecDef proposed that potentially three sets of </p><p>decisions are needed:  (1) The first decision set, needed </p><p>now, is to resume mil-to-mil planning talks, and to </p><p>immediately initiate site surveys that would be followed by </p><p>site preparations beginning early to mid January 03.  (2) The </p><p>second decision concerns acceptance of foreign troops on </p><p>Turkish soil, recognizing that the earliest likely troop </p><p>deployment would be 4-6 weeks from now. (3) The final </p><p>decision would be to use force, should the President of the </p><p>United States decide to do so (a decision he has not yet </p><p>made).  DepSecDef expressed appreciation that the Turkish PM </p><p>recognized the USG need for a timely response and personally </p><p>gave earlier that day his approval for immediately resuming </p><p>mil-to-mil planning and initiating site surveys. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. (S) DCHOD asked what role NATO could play in an Iraqi </p><p>operation, emphasizing that it would be very helpful for </p><p>Turkey to have some NATO cover.  DepSecDef replied that NATO </p><p>mechanisms could in principle be used for infrastructure </p><p>improvements as well as potential Article 5 scenarios if </p><p>conflict made it necessary to defend Turkey.  Ambassador </p><p>Pearson added that NATO\'s Prague Summit statement supporting </p><p>UNSCR 1441 could be useful in providing a NATO "umbrella" for </p><p>Turkish site surveys and site preparations.  TGS Dep J3 </p><p>emphasized that a parliamentary decision would be needed for </p><p>any troop deployments, whether they were engineers conducting </p><p>site preparations or combat troops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. (S) Turkey is Prepared to Deploy to Northern Iraq:  DCHOD </p><p>stated that the Turkish military has almost completed </p><p>preparations to prevent immigration and to control IDPs </p><p>inside Iraq, should military operations be required.  In the </p><p>event that Turkish forces deploy to Northern Iraq, the DCHOD </p><p>asked the USG to emphasize to Iraqi groups that Turkish </p><p>forces were not there as an occupying force.  DepSecDef </p><p>responded that the best way to convince the northern Iraqi </p><p>groups was to integrate all forces into a coordinated </p><p>coalition that could both manage the IDP challenges and exert </p><p>pressure on Baghdad.  DepSecDef again reiterated the value of </p><p>a two-front war to expedite successful operations; he also </p><p>noted that the potential role for UK forces was not "in" </p><p>northern Iraq, but deploying "through" northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. (S) NATO Command Structure Review:  DCHOD related that </p><p>the TGS was "not happy" with a recently received draft NATO </p><p>command structure document (MC324).  The draft did not </p><p>include any criteria by which to justify or rationalize the </p><p>NATO HQ structures and their proposed locations.  It gave an </p><p>appearance of taking a "sudden decision" without proper </p><p>criteria.  DepSecDef agreed that criteria needed to be </p><p>included and that USG was equally frustrated with the timing </p><p>of the document. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parliamentary Opposition CHP Leader Baykal </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33. (C) In his meeting with CHP and opposition leader Baykal, </p><p>DepSecDef highlighted US support for Turkey\'s EU candidacy </p><p>and for a definite accession negotiations date for Turkey to </p><p>be granted during the EU Copenhagen summit.  He reiterated </p><p>the USG view that the UN proposal for a Cyprus settlement </p><p>represents a way to a rapid solution and that turkey should </p><p>accept as the basis for further negotiations.  On Iraq, </p><p>DepSecDef underscored that: </p><p>- The US is working with a coalition of nations; </p><p>- The only way to hope for a peaceful resolution is to </p><p>demonstrate a credible threat of force; </p><p>- We recognize Turkey\'s economic vulnerabilities; </p><p>- All nations will benefit if Iraq becomes a free, open and </p><p>prosperous country; and, </p><p>- If war proves necessary, a strong coalition, including </p><p>Turkey, is critical to ensuring that the conflict is short </p><p>and to reducing its costs and risks. </p><p>27. (C) EU accession: Baykal regretted that an earlier </p><p>Turkish government (read: his rival Ecevit) had failed to </p><p>grasp the opportunity to join the EU at the same time as </p><p>Greece.  As a result, Turkey now works at a disadvantage </p><p>compared to Greece.  But CHP is committed to pursuing </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy and, in this regard, will support </p><p>efforts to this end by the AK government.  A "date for a </p><p>date" from Copenhagen is not enough.  We all need to know </p><p>whether Turkey is a European or Middle Eastern country.  If </p><p>Turkey is rebuffed by the EU and at the same time is forced </p><p>to cooperate with the US in an Iraq operation, especially in </p><p>northern Iraq, then the country could become destabilized. </p><p>If Turkey feels it is accepted as European, it can raise the </p><p>level of its cooperation with the US; in any event, relations </p><p>with the US are the pillar of Turkey\'s foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28.  (C) Cyprus: while supporting a fair and peaceful </p><p>solution, Baykal expressed reservations whether a solution is </p><p>possible in a short time and asserted CHP\'s dissatisfaction </p><p>with the UN paper.  First, a solution has to start from the </p><p>post-\'74 bizonality in which each community is homogeneous. </p><p>Second, the paper would have Cyprus revert to a pre-\'74 </p><p>arrangement.  One-third of the Greek Cypriots would move back </p><p>to the north, which would thus have two ethnic groups, </p><p>whereas the Greek Cypriot south would remain homogeneous, </p><p>thereby creating a disequilibrium which would lead to loss of </p><p>political equality over the next 20 years.  CHP economic guru </p><p>Dervis added that mixing the populations too fast would risk </p><p>an incident, e.g., a killing, which would toss 10 years of </p><p>good will out the window instantly.  Third, Baykal continued, </p><p>the proposed boundary lines are a problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) Iraq: reiterating his preference for a peaceful </p><p>diplomatic solution, Baykal called for the elimination of WMD </p><p>from the region around Turkey and expressed his desire for a </p><p>democratic, peaceful regime in Baghdad  He acknowledged how </p><p>critically important the Iraq question is for the US. And he </p><p>noted that sometimes it is impossible for a country like </p><p>Turkey to decide its own preferences in the face of the </p><p>strategic interests of a country like the US.  If </p><p>intervention is inescapable, then: </p><p>- It should be carried out under international legitimacy </p><p>with a clear legal basis; </p><p>- The burden on Turkey, both financial and refugee, must be </p><p>eliminated to avoid the damage done to Turkey\'s economic, </p><p>social and political fabric under the economic and refugee </p><p>impact of the Gulf War; </p><p>- It is essential to maintain the territorial integrity of </p><p>Iraq (and in this regard Baykal wants a clear picture of how </p><p>Turkey\'s concerns about Kurdish independence movements will </p><p>be met); and </p><p>- Any solution must take into account the interests of the </p><p>Turkomen who face Saddam Hussein\'s efforts to eliminate their </p><p>identity and homeland in and around Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOD Gonul </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. (S) DEPSECDEF,s meeting with the new AK Party Minister </p><p>of Defense was largely unsubstantive.  Not only is Turkey\'s </p><p>Defense Ministry restricted also exclusively to defense </p><p>procurement issues, but Gonul admitted he had not yet been </p><p>briefed on Iraq.  DEPSECDEF outlined the nature of our close </p><p>and transparent consultations to date, stressing that joint </p><p>military planning is our best chance for peace.  Saddam would </p><p>only change his mind about obeying UNSCRs if he is convinced </p><p>the only alternative is his removal by force.  He would be </p><p>convinced by actions, not words. Gonul agreed on the need to </p><p>be firm on UNSCR 1441.  He asserted that Saddam had thus far </p><p>complied with 1441 and urged the US to await the inspection </p><p>reports before deciding on a military option.  A Turkish </p><p>decision to cooperate, especially if it offered troops, would </p><p>be a huge decision.  DYP Chairman Ciller had lost many votes </p><p>by implying she would commit Turkish troops if she became PM. </p><p> That said, Gonul said Turkey would cooperate with the US, as </p><p>it always had, but he hoped it would not be in a crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31.(S) DEPSECDEF cautioned against "over-scaring" the Turkish </p><p>people about a possible Iraq operation.  Economic problems </p><p>largely spring from psychological reasons.  Any war could be </p><p>over relatively quickly and result in some substantial </p><p>benefits for Turkey.  The government should begin </p><p>accentuating the positive. </p><p>32. (U) This cable has been cleared by DepSecDef Wolfowitz </p><p>and U/S Grossman. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
