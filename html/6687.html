<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, WREINCKENS; </p><p>SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Over the 3/22-23 weekend Colombo\'s newspapers continued </p><p>to criticize the war.  "Stop this war forthwith," insisted </p><p>the independent English DAILY MIRROR.  The government-owned </p><p>Sinhala weekender, DINAMINA, spoke of the "Middle East war </p><p>environment:  crisis and impact."  "Alas!  War" said the </p><p>opposition Sinhala weekly, DIVAINA.  The opposition English </p><p>weekly, ISLAND SUNDAY, criticized Sri Lanka\'s "wishy-washy" </p><p>position on the war under the headline "A matter of self- </p><p>interest."  LAKBIMA, an independent Sinhala daily, called </p><p>President Bush "The Ugly American."  "Do not disable UN" </p><p>urged the independent Sinhala daily LANKADEEPA.  Playing on </p><p>Washington\'s "Shock and Awe," the government-owned English </p><p>weekly, SUNDAY OBSERVER said that the "awe and esteem with </p><p>which American and British democratic traditions have been </p><p>held by all of humanity is suddenly endangered by the </p><p>launching of a war sans the collective sanction of the </p><p>community of nations gathered in the UN."  The Independent </p><p>English weekly, SUNDAY TIMES, called it an "Un-holy war." </p><p>And VIRAKESARI, an independent Tamil daily, said that, </p><p>"Although the U.S. claims that this is a step to destroy </p><p>Saddam Hussein and his supporters, the whole world is </p><p>condemning the war as one against humanity.  Now the world </p><p>is divided into two.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>2. Independent English daily, DAILY MIRROR (3/22) </p><p>commented:  the war "... is against all norms of </p><p>international law and ethics for a foreign country to take </p><p>upon itself the task of liberating a people in a sovereign </p><p>land by military action....  What emerges as a ... paradox </p><p>is that those waging war today are avowed apostles of peace </p><p>who exhort all and sundry to resolve their conflicts </p><p>through peaceful means and negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>3. Government-owned Sinhala weekender, DINAMINA (3/22) </p><p>published the headline "Middle East war environment: </p><p>crisis and impact," over: </p><p> </p><p>"This war, initiated against the objections of the UN, will </p><p>have a plethora of negative impacts....  Migrant workers </p><p>... bring us a great deal of foreign exchange.  We are </p><p>thankful that the Minister of Labor is concerned for their </p><p>safety.  The government has also paid attention to consumer </p><p>items, and to fuel supplies.  But our country is famous for </p><p>words alone....  The impact will be nasty. </p><p> </p><p>It is sensible to provide diplomatic missions with </p><p>protection, and government steps to prohibit demonstrations </p><p>is also commendable....  We are already feeling the </p><p>negative impact of twenty years of war in our own country. </p><p>Now there is another war over which we can have no </p><p>influence....  While we do not endorse any military action, </p><p>we unanimously agree that the impact on our people should </p><p>be minimized." </p><p> </p><p>4. The opposition Sinhala weekly, DIVAINA (3/23) thought </p><p>ironic that, "while the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE </p><p>were discussing peace in Japan, a bloody war commenced, </p><p>shocking the whole world.  A war initiated by George B. on </p><p>Iraq....  How wise was Bush\'s decision, the future will </p><p>ask. </p><p> </p><p>"Is the U.S. chasing Saddam away to free the Iraqi nation? </p><p>What sort of fairyland will the U.S. build in Iraq after </p><p>victimizing innocent people?  When will these cruel leaders </p><p>realize that their might is not justice?  If a country\'s </p><p>leader is a dictator, steps to remove him should be taken </p><p>by a world authority and ... in a fair manner...." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Opposition English weekly, ISLAND SUNDAY (3/23) </p><p>criticized the Sri Lankan government\'s "wishy-washy </p><p>statement on the war....  Uncle Sam is going to crush Iraq </p><p>and in the process inflict untold suffering on helpless </p><p>people.  Clearly we cannot cheer him on, but neither must </p><p>we rap him on his knuckles leave alone kick him in the </p><p>bottom.  So we issue the kind of statement we were treated </p><p>to last week.  Colombo obviously could not influence the </p><p>course of events....  Certainly not roar like the lion </p><p>emblazoned on our national flag or even cluck like a broody </p><p>hen.  So voice the usual platitudes.  Say that we have long </p><p>urged Baghdad [to] comply with Security Council resolutions </p><p>and get rid of its weapons of mass destruction....  Then we </p><p>hope for a quick end to the conflict....  We are gravely </p><p>concerned about the humanitarian consequences of the </p><p>war....  Hence our "confidence that the coalition partners </p><p>would move early to minimize adverse consequences on the </p><p>civilian population in Iraq" and our blind faith that those </p><p>who are dropping the bombs will move swiftly to repair the </p><p>damage....  Nary a word of censure.... </p><p> </p><p>"Whether there will be a payoff for statements such as last </p><p>week\'s effort by the Colombo foreign office only time can </p><p>tell.  But a harder line, as practitioners of real politik </p><p>well understand, would surely have meant a payback...." </p><p> </p><p>6. Independent Sinhala daily, LAKBIMA, called President </p><p>Bush "The Ugly American": </p><p> </p><p>"The world saw on TV how Bush opened the doors of </p><p>destruction and misfortune by initiating the war against </p><p>Iraq....  the U.S. ... dancing a devil dance....  Where </p><p>will this end?  Will there be a dictator for the whole </p><p>world using its military power?  We have a lot to say on </p><p>this subject but this is what America\'s most popular </p><p>president, John F Kennedy, said:  `If mankind does not put </p><p>a stop to war, war will put a stop to mankind.\'" </p><p> </p><p>7. Independent Sinhala daily LANKADEEPA (3/22) pleaded "Do </p><p>not disable UN" </p><p> </p><p>"The wagers of war, the UK and the U.S., are members of the </p><p>UN.  So are Australia and Spain....  They should respect UN </p><p>policies....  All countries should get together to </p><p>strengthen the UN....  The UN was established to pursue </p><p>important objectives.  One of them is securing peace in the </p><p>world....  This war should be immediately stopped and the </p><p>Iraq issue should be solved through a peaceful process." </p><p> </p><p>8. Independent weekender, SUNDAY LEADER (3/23) delineated </p><p>the "lessons of war": </p><p> </p><p>- For Sri Lanka:  "From being the donors\' darling right </p><p>now, the prospect of Sri Lanka being relegated to runner-up </p><p>to Iraq in the begging-bowl relay in June, must give the </p><p>Prime Minister very cold feet indeed.  There\'s only so much </p><p>money that the planet\'s better heeled nations dole out to </p><p>their impoverished cousins each year.  It now seems we will </p><p>have to share our cake with Iraq: the race to be seen </p><p>offering bags of largesse will be far sexier to the anti- </p><p>war citizens of Europe and Japan, than to send some cash in </p><p>our direction...." </p><p> </p><p>- for the U.S.  "American credibility can come only from </p><p>its pushing Israel into a just, negotiated settlement with </p><p>the Palestinians, installing a UN peacekeeping force in the </p><p>region if need be.  Bludgeoning Saddam into submission </p><p>while giving Israel a free hand to settle on Palestinian </p><p>lands and deprive Palestinians of the right of nationhood </p><p>is an act of supreme hypocrisy.  And for a meaningful </p><p>settlement of the `Middle-East Question,\' both France and </p><p>the UN are indispensable.  Fences need to be mended, and </p><p>right quickly, too." </p><p> </p><p>- for the future:  "...start thinking seriously about how </p><p>relevant the permanent membership of the UN Security </p><p>Council is in the world order that has emerged since 1945. </p><p>It may be time to give the EU and Japan seats as permanent </p><p>members, and with it the right of veto....  Only new </p><p>attitudes and more democracy at the highest level of world </p><p>governance will give rise to a truly enlightened new </p><p>international order:  if ever there was a millennium </p><p>challenge, then this challenge is that challenge." </p><p> </p><p>9. Government-owned English weekly, SUNDAY OBSERVER (3/23) </p><p>commented:  "... the formally stated intentions of </p><p>Washington and its allies in attacking Iraq are laudable </p><p>and eminently reasonable.  The primary issue in relation to </p><p>Iraq has been its weapons capability, especially weapons of </p><p>mass destruction, and Baghdad\'s propensity for aggression </p><p>against its neighbours as well as its record of use of its </p><p>deadly weaponry....  Today humanity is no longer a </p><p>collection of loosely linked or isolated polities and </p><p>communities.  The world is so closely knit that all </p><p>communities and states are easily vulnerable to the actions </p><p>of each other, whether it is in trade, ecological </p><p>depredations or military action.  The misbehaviour of </p><p>individual states today destabilise whole regions and </p><p>sometimes may negatively affect the whole Earth. </p><p> </p><p>"But the management of global affairs can only be done by </p><p>collective decision-making institutions at a global level. </p><p>The international community has grown, in the past half- </p><p>century, to appreciate and uphold the United Nations </p><p>system, along with other, subsequently established, </p><p>institutions of global management such as the WTO and other </p><p>bodies and international legal mechanisms.  Today these are </p><p>the ultimate, though yet imperfect, source of global </p><p>democracy and governance....  That is why the recent </p><p>failure of the US and its allies to adhere to the UN </p><p>process in relation to Iraq has sent shock waves through </p><p>the international community.  Indeed, the awe and esteem </p><p>with which American and British democratic traditions have </p><p>been held by all of humanity is suddenly endangered by the </p><p>launching of a war sans the collective sanction of the </p><p>community of nations gathered in the UN. </p><p> </p><p>"The US and its allies now bear the challenge of returning </p><p>as quickly as possible to the UN fold and proceeding with </p><p>all future actions in relation to Iraq via the global </p><p>collective decision-making process.  It is only such a </p><p>rapid submission to the global system of governance that </p><p>will redeem these leaderships and legitimise their </p><p>undeniably honourable intentions.  More importantly, it </p><p>will guarantee the future of this system so vital as it is </p><p>for global peace and prosperity." </p><p> </p><p>10. Independent English weekly, SUNDAY TIMES (3/23) called </p><p>the war "... a grudge match at the insistence of just one </p><p>man, arguably the most powerful man in the world.  In this </p><p>day and age in the face of overwhelming opposition that one </p><p>can send your army to kill the head of a sovereign state </p><p>... is surreal.... </p><p> </p><p>"... the United States, long having lost the moral right to </p><p>preach to the world what\'s right and what\'s wrong, is now </p><p>pass as a moral arbiter in international affairs. </p><p> </p><p>"Countries such as ours have no option but to grin and </p><p>bear, while the President of the United States settles old </p><p>scores with impunity and with absolute disregard for </p><p>international law.  In our position as bystander in this </p><p>whole imbroglio, we are reduced to making see-saw </p><p>statements and scramble to control the fallout disaster to </p><p>our own affairs." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
