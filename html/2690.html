<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001027 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEPAD MEETING SIDESTEPS ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON 1.5 (D.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Despite high-level attendance </p><p>(including nine Heads of State), the March 26 NEPAD </p><p>Summit did not produce any dramatic developments; the </p><p>meeting was basically a planning session. The final </p><p>communique was silent on Zimbabwe. However, Summit </p><p>discussions and public statements by key participants </p><p>criticized the West for being more concerned about </p><p>that country than other African states, including </p><p>chronic trouble spots, and for threatening to withhold </p><p>cooperation from NEPAD due to disagreements between </p><p>the West and Africa over how to handle Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>political crisis. The Summit reviewed draft action </p><p>plans on Political Governance and Economic Governance, </p><p>both with peer review mechanisms.  Draft plans were </p><p>also considered in the critical areas of Agriculture, </p><p>Infrastructure, Capital Flows, and Human Development </p><p>(Health and Education).  The draft plans are not </p><p>scheduled to be finalized until July, which will be </p><p>too late to inform G-8 discussions on Africa during </p><p>the June meeting in Canada. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a luncheon hosted by the Canadian High </p><p>Commissioner, Ambassador Jeter got a read-out of the </p><p>Summit from Nigerian officials seconded to the NEPAD </p><p>secretariat: Ambassador Isaac Aluko Alokun, Sola </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Akinabe, and Sunday Dogonyaro. (With Canada hosting </p><p>the G-8, Prime Minister Chretien is scheduled to </p><p>arrive in Abuja next week for talks with Obasanjo and </p><p>other African Heads of State to discuss the </p><p>relationship between NEPAD and the contemplated G-8 </p><p>Action Plan for Africa.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ZIMBABWE -- TOO HOT AND PREMATURE TO HANDLE! </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Although the turbulence of Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>crisis loomed over the conference, the Summit </p><p>communique does not mention the country.  However, </p><p>Zimbabwe was discussed on the margins.  According to </p><p>the Nigerian trio at the luncheon, the discussion on </p><p>Zimbabwe was awkward, at times difficult. Some Heads </p><p>of State were piqued by the attention the West </p><p>focused on Zimbabwe, claiming egregious political </p><p>events in other African states received but a fraction </p><p>of the glare directed at Harare. Angola was often </p><p>cited as an example. The Summiteers thought the </p><p>attention was not due to any objective standard but </p><p>because of the UK\'s patronage of the country\'s white </p><p>minority.  Almost everyone criticized the pace of </p><p>Zimbabwean land reform and the UK role in it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Several leaders argued the inappropriateness </p><p>of raising Zimbabwe at this forum since the Mugabe </p><p>government had not yet joined NEPAD. With few </p><p>exceptions, the Summiteers did not want NEPAD, at such </p><p>an early stage in its development, to enmesh itself in </p><p>this controversy. Here, the participants had a </p><p>procedural out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  As the communique indicates, the document </p><p>creating the African Peer Review Mechanism is a draft </p><p>that needs to be finalized at the next meeting of the </p><p>Peer Review Steering Committee.  This meeting is </p><p>several months away.  Because the peer review </p><p>mechanism is still a work in progress, Summiteers who </p><p>did not want to condemn Harare argued that </p><p>consideration of Zimbabwe was premature and improper </p><p>because there was no agreed mechanism by which to </p><p>conduct the review. During a rather heated exchange </p><p>between the Algerian and Portuguese Ambassadors at a </p><p>March 27 dinner Ambassador Jeter also attended, the </p><p>Algerian expressed consternation at what he termed </p><p>Western attempts to link NEPAD\'s viability to </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He claimed that resolving political crises </p><p>like Zimbabwe was not the main thrust of NEPAD.  In </p><p>any event, Zimbabwe was not ripe for discussion until </p><p>the peer review mechanism had been adopted. This </p><p>position, he said, would be explained by the African </p><p>leaders at the G-8 Summit.(Comment: The subtext of the </p><p>Nigerian trio and the Algerian envoy\'s statements was </p><p>that most participants opposed discussion of Zimbabwe </p><p>because they did not want to be seen as succumbing to </p><p>Western pressure. Obasanjo struck this tone in a </p><p>public statement made on the eve of the NEPAD Summit, </p><p>which Ambassador Aluko Alokun said grew out of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s frustrations at the London Commonwealth </p><p>meeting. In a not so oblique reference to Zimbabwe, </p><p>Obasanjo criticized the West for threatening to </p><p>distance itself from NEPAD because of dissatisfaction </p><p>with the conduct of one single African country. </p><p>Obasanjo claimed this pressure was, in effect, an </p><p>attempt to "take "NEPAD away from Africa." End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NEPAD secretariat officials at the luncheon </p><p>explained that the Heads of State did not view NEPAD </p><p>as a new organization but an initiative under the </p><p>aegis of the OAU/AU. Once the peer review mechanism </p><p>was finalized by NEPAD it would go to the OAU for </p><p>final adoption. Only when adopted by the OAU, would it </p><p>have any binding force.  Currently, the basic outline </p><p>for the review mechanism calls for a technical </p><p>committee in NEPAD to assess members\' good governance </p><p>and social development against agreed upon standards. </p><p>Based on these assessments, the technical committee </p><p>will prepare country reports on member-states. </p><p>Actions against misbehaving or non-performing states, </p><p>including sanctions, are to be decided, through a </p><p>political process, at the Head of State level. </p><p>(Comment: The scenario painted by the NEPAD staff </p><p>assumes universal acceptance of the review mechanism. </p><p>The legal status of the mechanism, should any OAU/AU </p><p>member oppose its adoption as an unwarranted </p><p>interference in domestic affairs, is a question that </p><p>may not have been asked or answered at the Summit. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>A NEW APPROACH, BUT SOME OLD RHETORIC </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) There was noticeably more West-bashing </p><p>emanating from the conference hall than at the </p><p>previous NEPAD Summit in Abuja last October. </p><p>President Obasanjo set the stage in a March 25 public </p><p>statement.  After meeting with OAU/AU Secretary </p><p>General Amara Essy, Obasanjo chastised Western nations </p><p>for expressing "warm words" but not providing any </p><p>concrete assistance on debt relief.  He vowed that </p><p>NEPAD would be the product of African leadership, not </p><p>the dictates of others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A discordance, critical of the West, has been </p><p>noticeable in Obasanjo\'s public statements during the </p><p>past few weeks. Part of this is due to the </p><p>disagreement over Zimbabwe that, at times became an </p><p>emotionally charged issue for Obasanjo.  Also, </p><p>Obasanjo is clearly frustrated that, for all of his </p><p>lobbying and visibility on the world stage, coupled </p><p>with his decision to stake out a basically pro-Western </p><p>foreign policy, he has not landed more tangible </p><p>assistance for Nigeria, particularly on his pet issue </p><p>of debt relief.  Additionally, domestic pressures now </p><p>are escalating as elections approach and the economy </p><p>sputters.  Obasanjo\'s nature is to blame others when </p><p>the chips do not fall as he hoped.  Nigeria has come </p><p>up short but, in his mind, the responsibility belongs </p><p>to others.  Usually, he blames domestic opponents. </p><p>This time, the confluence of Zimbabwe, the UN </p><p>Monterrey conference, and NEPAD made the creditor </p><p>Western democracies too attractive a collective target </p><p>to ignore. Additionally, the early March suspension of </p><p>a formal IMF-GON program, billed here as Nigeria </p><p>showing the IMF the exit door in order to develop a </p><p>home-grown reform package fits into the anti-West </p><p>posturing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Obasanjo\'s outburst might be the result of </p><p>temporary pique due to this convergence of events.  He </p><p>often deviates from script when annoyed and these </p><p>forays sometimes yield regrettable statements. </p><p>However, with political and economic pressures </p><p>mounting around him, it is likely this rhetoric will </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHAT NEXT FOR NEPAD </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In addition to the Political Governance action </p><p>plan (Political Peer Review) there is also an Economic </p><p>and Corporate Governance plan and Peer Review </p><p>Mechanism intended to encourage governmental best </p><p>practices in economics and finance in order promote </p><p>private sector growth and investment. Also, to promote </p><p>"fast track" development, the Summit reviewed action </p><p>plans in the following sectors: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Agriculture and Market Access; </p><p>-- Infrastructure (Information and Communication </p><p>Technologies, Water and Sanitation, Transportation and </p><p>Energy); </p><p>--Capital Flows; and </p><p>-- Human Development (Education and Health, </p><p>particularly HIV/AIDS and other communicable </p><p>diseases). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The NEPAD Secretariat officials stated that </p><p>the Political Governance draft action plan was more </p><p>developed than the other draft plans but none was </p><p>complete.  They did not expect completion and final </p><p>adoption until July. The next NEPAD Summit will be in </p><p>Dakar in April.  The focus of that meeting will be </p><p>attracting private sector buy-in to the NEPAD process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>NEPAD AND THE G-8 </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The Canadian High Commissioner expressed </p><p>concern that schedule for finalizing the papers would </p><p>make it difficult to hold meaningful discussions </p><p>regarding NEPAD with the G-8 this year.  The G-8 </p><p>wanted to roll out its own Plan of Action for Africa </p><p>at the June Summit in Canada. As part of this process, </p><p>the G-8 hoped to meld as much of NEPAD into its </p><p>deliberations as possible.  However, the July date for </p><p>final adoption of the NEPAD action plans will be too </p><p>late to inform G-8 discussions in June. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) FYI: the following Heads of State attended </p><p>the conference: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abdelaziz Bouteflika  -  Algeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Denis Sassou Nguesso  - Republic of the Congo </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Joaquim Alberto Chissano - Mozambique </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo     - Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Paul Kagame           - Rwanda </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abdoulaye Wade        - Senegal </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thabo Mbeki           - South Africa </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meles Zenawi          - Ethiopia </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anerood Jugnauth      - Mauritius </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, Gabon Vice President Di Ndinge, Egyptian </p><p>Minister for Foreign Relations and International </p><p>Cooperation El-Naga, Malian Foreign Minister Sidibe, </p><p>OAU Assistant Secretary Generals Lawrence Agubuzu and </p><p>Said Djinnit, as well as officials from UNECA, ADB and </p><p>FAO also attended the Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) There were no major breakthroughs at this </p><p>Summit which, beside the Zimbabwe issue which was not </p><p>a formal agenda item, was more procedural than </p><p>substantive. Clearly our belief that the Summit should </p><p>have made a statement about the Zimbabwean political </p><p>crisis was opposed by many of the Summiteers and it </p><p>may be months before the Governance Peer Review </p><p>Mechanism is in place. In the interim, we should work </p><p>behind the scenes with some of the prime architects </p><p>behind NEPAD so that Zimbabwe is subject to review </p><p>when the time is ripe under the NEPAD schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
