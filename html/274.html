<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 14054 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  SITREP NO. 8:  TIANANMEN SQUARE CROWDS GROW </p><p>TO 300,000 OR MORE ON THE EVENING OF MAY 21; </p><p>GOVERNMENT DENIES LI PENG HAS ORDERED THE PLA TO </p><p>ATTACK STUDENTS EARLY ON MAY 22. </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 14053 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ACTIVISTS AND ONLOOKERS RETURNED TO </p><p>TIANANMEN SQUARE IN LARGE NUMBERS ON THE EVENING OF </p><p>MAY 21 AMID WIDESPREAD RUMORS THAT PLA TROOPS WOULD </p><p>ATTACK THE SQUARE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF MAY 22.  BY </p><p>2100 (LOCAL TIME), THE CROWD HAD GROWN TO OVER </p><p>300,000.  THERE WERE AT LEAST 50,000 ACTIVISTS IN THE </p><p>SQUARE, WITH MORE ARRIVING EVERY MINUTE.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DENIED CLAIMS BY STUDENTS THAT PREMIER LI </p><p>PENG HAD ORDERED THE ARMY TO MOVE INTO THE SQUARE AT </p><p>O500 ON MAY 22 AND KILL OR CAPTURE ALL THE STUDENTS </p><p>THERE.  STUDENTS HAD A BUS IN POSITION TO BLOCK THE </p><p>POSSIBLE EMERGENCE OF TROOPS FROM THE WEST EXIT OF </p><p>THE TRAIN STATION, AND WERE USING LARGE CONTINGENTS </p><p>OF ACTIVISTS TO BLOCK MAJOR INTERSECTIONS NEAR </p><p>TIANANMEN SQUARE.  MEDIA SOURCES REPORTED THAT THREE </p><p>AIDES TO ZHAO ZIYANG HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, AND THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF PEOPLE\'S DAILY AND </p><p>CCTV.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, FOREIGN NEW AGENCIES </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THEIR LINES WOULD BE CUT SOON.  THEY </p><p>ARE USING TRAVELLERS TO GET VIDEO MATERIAL OUT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TIANANMEN CROWD NUMBERS 300,000 AT 2100 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT 1900 ON MAY 21, THE CROWD AT TIANANMEN WAS </p><p>RELATIVELY LIGHT, NUMBERING ABOUT 150,000 TO </p><p>200,000.  ABOUT 50,000 OF THAT NUMBER WERE ACTIVISTS </p><p>ON THE SQUARE.  STUDENTS WERE SPREADING THE WORD OF </p><p>"LI PENG\'S THREE POINTS" (SEE BELOW), CALLING ON </p><p>ONLOOKERS TO SUPPORT THEM WHEN THE SOLDIERS ARRIVED </p><p>EARLY ON MAY 22.  STUDENTS TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THE </p><p>CROWD WOULD INCREASE IN NUMBER AFTER NIGHTFALL, IN </p><p>EXPECTATION OF THE ARMY\'S ARRIVAL.  BY 2100, THE </p><p>CROWD HAD GROWN TO ABOUT 300,000.  ACTIVISTS WERE </p><p>BEING FERRIED IN BY TRUCKS, BUSES, AND CARS. </p><p>ONLOOKERS WERE BICYCLING INTO THE TIANANMEN AREA. </p><p>AT 2100 ONE OF THE OUTER GRANDSTANDS AT THE </p><p>NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE SQUARE WAS FULL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT DENIES ATTACK ORDERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL THROUGH THE DAY ON MAY 21, STUDENTS IN THE </p><p>SQUARE WERE SPREADING THE WORD THAT THE ARMY HAD </p><p>RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO ATTACK THE </p><p>STUDENTS AT O500 (LOCAL TIME) ON MAY 22.  STUDENTS </p><p>CLAIMED THAT SYMPATHETIC SOURCES IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD INFORMED THEM THAT TROOPS HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY </p><p>PREMIER LI PENG TO CLEAR THE SQUARE, "EVEN IF 200,000 </p><p>STUDENTS WERE KILLED."  PRISONS WERE BEING CLEARED TO </p><p>HOUSE STUDENTS, STUDENTS SAID, AND CLEAN-UP CREWS </p><p>ALERTED TO TIDY UP THE SQUARE AS SOON AS THE STUDENTS </p><p>WERE REMOVED.  CNN REPORTED THIS INFORMATION ON MAY </p><p>21, CITING STUDENT SOURCES.  AT 2230 ON MAY 21, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ISSUED A DENIAL THAT ANY SUCH ORDER HAD </p><p>BEEN GIVEN.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENT, REPEATED </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES OVER RADIO AND TELEVISION, RECOUNTED </p><p>EACH ELEMENT OF THE ALLEGED "ORDER" AS DESCRIBED BY </p><p>THE STUDENTS AND DENIED THAT ANY PART OF IT WAS </p><p>TRUE.  CITIZENS WERE WARNED TO BEWARE OF RUMOR </p><p>MONGERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CROWD\'S MOOD:  STUDENTS PREPARED TO DIE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  EMBOFFS SPOKE TO QINGHUA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO </p><p>WERE GUARDING ONE EXIT FROM THE QIANMEN SUBWAY.  THE </p><p>STUDENTS, EXPECTING TO BE ATTACKED IN THE EARLY </p><p>MORNING HOURS OF MAY 22, SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>USE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS.  THE YOUTHS SAID </p><p>THEY WERE PREPARED TO DIE TO STOP THE ARMY FROM </p><p>CLEARING TIANANMEN SQUARE OF STUDENTS.  THE </p><p>ONLOOKERS AND STUDENTS SEEMED ENERGETIC AND </p><p>DETERMINED IN THE MID-EVENING HOURS OF MAY 21. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRAIN STATION:  WEST EXIT BLOCKED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS NOTED SITREP 7, THERE ARE CONFIRMED REPORTS </p><p>OF A TROOP TRAIN AT THE TRAIN STATION.  STUDENTS ON </p><p>THE SQUARE TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THEY HAD SENT </p><p>EMISSARIES TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION AT THE </p><p>BEIJING TRAIN STATION.  BETWEEN 2130 AND 2145, </p><p>EMBOFFS SAW AN EMPTY BUS BLOCKING THE WEST EXIT OF </p><p>THE TRAIN STATION, THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO THE </p><p>SQUARE FROM THE STATION.  EMBOFFS ESTIMATED THAT UP </p><p>TO SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE IN THE VICINITY OF THE </p><p>TRAIN STATION.  THE TRAINS APPEARED  TO BE RUNNING </p><p>NORMALLY DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS OF MAY 21. </p><p>EMBOFFS MET A WORKER IN THE SQUARE WHO HAD ARRIVED </p><p>BY TRAIN FROM NANJING THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 21.  THE </p><p>WORKER HAD SEEN SOLDIERS CARRYING  RIFLES AND </p><p>AMMUNITION ON HIS TRAIN, BUT HE SAID THAT THEY WERE </p><p>FEW IN NUMBER.  AT 2200, EMBOFFS WITNESSED ORDINARY </p><p>TRAVELERS EMERGING FROM THE BEIJING STATION, </p><p>CARRYING LUGGAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHONGWENMEN BLOCKADE:  STUDENTS TAKE THE LEAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  EMBOFFS INTERVIEWED STUDENTS AT CHONGWENMEN </p><p>INTERSECTION, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS TYPICAL OF OTHERS </p><p>NEAR THE TIANANMEN AREA.  SIX TO EIGHT THOUSAND </p><p>STUDENTS WERE PRESENT AT THE INTERSEOCTION.  A </p><p>STUDENT FROM XIAN WAS DIRECTING THE CROWD, ABOUT </p><p>HALF OF WHOM WERE STUDENTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>CROWD IN THE INTERSECTION, THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS </p><p>OF PEOPLE BEYOND THE BLOCKADE.  IN TALKING WITH </p><p>PEOPLE AT THE INTERSECTION, EMBOFFS WERE TOLD THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH LOCAL PARTY COMMITTEES WERE NOT INVOLVED </p><p>MANY PARTY MEMBERS WERE.  THE PARTICIPANTS TOLD </p><p>EMBOFFS THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE MILITARY WAS </p><p>GOING TO ADVANCE ON THE STUDENTS IN THE EARLY </p><p>MORNING HOURS OF MAY 22. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZHAO AIDES REPORTEDLY ARRESTED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  A FOREIGN MEDIA SOURCE QUOTED A CHINESE </p><p>JOURNALIST TO TELL EMBOFF THAT THREE AIDES TO </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. </p><p>THE AIDES WERE IDENTIFIED AS BAO TONG, WU JIAXIANG, </p><p>AND CHEN XIAOLU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRESS PROBLEMS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  UPI AND OTHER AGENCIES EXPECT TO "HAVE THEIR </p><p>PLUGS PULLED" ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 21.  ONE NETWORK </p><p>WAS THREATENED MAY 20 WITH HAVING ALL OF ITS IDD </p><p>PHONES CUT OFF, BUT MANAGED TO AVERT THIS THROUGH </p><p>NEGOTIATION.  THE NETWORKS ARE ALL USING TRAVELLERS </p><p>TO GET VIDEO MATERIAL OUT OF THE COUNTRY; THE USE OF </p><p>SATELLITE FOR REPORTING IS OUT OF THE QUESTION, AND </p><p>CCTV FACILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO FOREIGN TV </p><p>NETS.  RUMORS ABOUND THAT THE MILITARY HAS TAKEN OVER </p><p>CCTV AND THAT CENSORSHIP OF THE PRINT MEDIA IS IN </p><p>EFFECT.  A U.S. NETWORK SOURCE REPORTED THAT 75 </p><p>MILITARY OFFICIALS IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES TOOK CONTROL </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21.  NONE </p><p>OF THESE REPORTS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
