<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0116 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 22, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 22, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal: It is reported that the person code </p><p>named "Mahmut" who committed suicide during the </p><p>security forces\' PKK/KADEK operation in Silopi, </p><p>was the PKK\'s person in charge for Cudi Mountain. </p><p>It is claimed that "Mahmut" whose ID has not been </p><p>disclosed yet, was a Syrian national. The police </p><p>in Silopi started surveillance last Friday of a </p><p>PKK/KADEK suspect, Abdullah Kayhan, who met with </p><p>two persons known as "Mahmut" and "Harun."  When </p><p>the security forces arrested Harun, Mahmut, </p><p>recognizing that he also would be arrested, </p><p>committed suicide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Sabah/Radikal/Hurriyet:  In </p><p>its most recent issue, Time Magazine selected the </p><p>chairwoman of Diyarbakir-based Ka-Mer (Women\'s </p><p>Center), Nebahat Akkoc, as one of the 38 persons </p><p>identified as "the heroes of the modern age." </p><p>The contestants were selected from people living </p><p>in Europe and the Middle East.  The magazine </p><p>emphasized that Akkoc struggled for defending the </p><p>rights of Anatolian women exposed to domestic </p><p>violence, and added that according to the UN </p><p>figures, 58 percent of women in Anatolia were </p><p>exposed to violent acts by their spouses.  The </p><p>mother of two children, Mrs. Akkoc, who lost her </p><p>husband to a mysterious killing in 1993, founded </p><p>Ka-Mer in Diyarbakir in 1997, and has been </p><p>providing legal and psychological support at its </p><p>seven branches in the southeast to women </p><p>subjected to violence.  Currently, Mrs. Akkoc is </p><p>focused on fighting against honor killings in the </p><p>rural regions, a common practice, and has managed </p><p>to rescue a young girl for whom a death decision </p><p>was made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye/Bolge/Milli Gazete: The new courthouse of </p><p>Adana, the construction of which started five </p><p>years ago and cost approximately USD 9.375 </p><p>million, was opened for service. Regarding the </p><p>new courthouse, the Chief Public Prosecutor, </p><p>Cemal Sahir Gurcay, said he attached great </p><p>importance to security, and had assigned 58 </p><p>policemen in addition to the jandarma for that </p><p>purpose.  Gurcay added that he was particularly </p><p>interested in the internal security of the </p><p>building in order to eradicate the negative </p><p>reputation of the former courthouse famed for </p><p>fights among the families attending the hearings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye/Bolge:  In Adana, the police arrested 10 </p><p>persons, including three women, for being members </p><p>of "Cakarlar," a gang which extorted money from </p><p>citizens in various quarters of the town by </p><p>threat or blackmail. The suspects were arrested </p><p>when the police launched an operation to arrest </p><p>the perpetrators of armed assaults at two tea- </p><p>shops and a house in Seyhan district.  While </p><p>searching the suspects\' homes, the police seized </p><p>one automatic Kalashnikov, one hunting gun, and </p><p>ammunition for those weapons.  The suspects were </p><p>taken to the State Security Court following the </p><p>completion of their interrogation at the Security </p><p>Directorate.  The suspects threatened a </p><p>journalist with death as they left for court. The </p><p>police are still looking for the alleged leader </p><p>of the gang, Tarik Cakar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkiye:  Based on a tip, the police in Adiyaman </p><p>arrested Dogan Tanriverdi red-handed while he was </p><p>trying to sell 4 kilos of heroin in town.  An </p><p>investigation is underway, the officials said. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
