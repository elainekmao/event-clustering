<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, HR, PGOV, HR, IZ, IZPREL, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: BUCKING UP THE WEAK-KNEED CROATIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 338 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CROATIA\'S INITIAL SUPPORT FOR THE USG POSITION ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z </p><p>IRAQ IS WAVERING UNDER PRESSURE FROM EU COUNTRIES AS THE GOC </p><p>PREPARES TO PRESENT ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST ACTION IN IRAQ WITHOUT NEW UNSC </p><p>SANCTION IS ALSO A STRONG FACTOR AS PM RACAN TRIES TO KEEP A </p><p>SHAKY COALITION TOGETHER.  ON FEBRUARY 13, ONE DAY AFTER PM </p><p>RACAN CALLED THE RECENT VILNIUS-10 STATEMENT "OPEN TO </p><p>INTERPRETATION," THE AMBASSADOR DELIVERED A STRONG MESSAGE TO </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTRY: THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT HOW THE EU </p><p>INTERPRETS CROATIA\'S STATEMENTS, BUT HOW THE WORLD REMOVES </p><p>THE THREAT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p>LATER ON FEBRUARY 13 (BUT INDEPENDENT OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>MESSAGE), PM RACAN RELEASED A MORE APPROPRIATE STATEMENT (SEE </p><p>TEXT AT PARA 9 BELOW) CALLING FOR FULL IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH </p><p>UNSCR 1441 TOGETHER WITH AN APPEAL FOR A UNIFIED POSITION </p><p>WITHIN THE EU AND BETWEEN THE EU AND THE USG.  IT SEEMS CLEAR </p><p>TO US THAT THE GOC BELIEVES THAT SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>READY TO HOLD CROATIA\'S EU APPLICATION HOSTAGE TO GOC </p><p>BEHAVIOR ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 12, PM RACAN TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ALL </p><p>"VILNIUS 10" COUNTRIES WAS "IMPRECISE ... AND OPEN TO </p><p>INTERPRETATION" (REFTEL).  ABSENT CLEAR LEADERSHIP, THE </p><p>PUBLIC DEBATE IN CROATIA HAS FOCUSED NOT ON THE THREAT POSED </p><p>BY SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S REGIME AND ITS WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION, BUT ON WHETHER OR NOT FM PICULA SHOULD HAVE </p><p>SIGNED THE V-10 STATEMENT AND HOW CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU </p><p>MEMBERSHIP WILL BE AFFECTED BY ITS POSITION ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 13, THE AMBASSADOR SOUGHT AN EARLY </p><p>MEETING WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO GET THE GOC TO REFOCUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z </p><p>ITS ENERGY ON THE MORE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE.  WITH </p><p>ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER NOBILO, HE PRESSED FOR THE GOC TO </p><p>"GET OFF THE FENCE;" PM RACAN\'S STATEMENT ON FEBRUARY 12 WAS </p><p>EQUIVOCAL AND LOOKED LIKE CROATIA WAS BACKING AWAY FROM THE </p><p>V-10 STATEMENT.  WHAT WAS CROATIA\'S POLICY, ANYWAY? </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NOBILO SAID THAT CROATIA IS NOT BACKING AWAY FROM THE </p><p>V-10 STATEMENT, BUT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PERCEPTION IN </p><p>THE PUBLIC AND IN POLITICAL CIRCLES THAT THE GOC WAS HURRIED </p><p>INTO SIGNING THE STATEMENT AND HAD MADE A BINDING COMMITMENT </p><p>TO SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION.  HE APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>FOR "PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING" AS THE GOC IS IN A DELICATE </p><p>SITUATION.  THE GOC IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF SUBMITTING ITS </p><p>APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP; THE REACTION OF THE EU COULD </p><p>HAVE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE CURRENT COALITION </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS ALREADY ON SHAKY GROUND IN AN ELECTION </p><p>YEAR.  NOBILO SAID THAT THE GOC POSITION WOULD BE "CLARIFIED" </p><p>BY A STATEMENT TO BE RELEASED LATER IN THE DAY FOLLOWING A </p><p>CABINET MEETING THEN UNDERWAY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID WE WOULD LOOK AT THE STATEMENT </p><p>CAREFULLY AND WOULD BE BACK IN TOUCH, BUT WARNED THAT THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF FORTHRIGHT GOC LEADERSHIP ON THE REAL ISSUE AT </p><p>STAKE -- DISARMING SADDAM -- IS ALLOWING THE PUBLIC DEBATE TO </p><p>GET OFF TRACK.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED; THIS </p><p>IS ONE OF THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN NATIONS MUST TAKE A </p><p>STAND; CROATIA TOOK A STRONG STAND WHEN IT SIGNED UP TO THE </p><p>V-10 STATEMENT; NOW IT WAS WEAKENING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NOBILO WAS EXPLICIT ABOUT EU PRESSURE, EXPLAINING </p><p>THAT THE GOC IS UNDER HEAVY PRESSURE FROM "OPPONENTS" OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z </p><p>U.S. ON IRAQ (HE DID EVERYTHING BUT SAY FRANCE AND GERMANY BY </p><p>NAME).  THE "BIG" EU STATES HAVE WARNED THEM THAT THE </p><p>"INCOMING COUNTRIES ARE BEING PERCEIVED AS TROUBLEMAKERS" AND </p><p>SAID THAT CROATIA MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO HURT PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, WHICH IT PLANS TO SUBMIT </p><p>NEXT WEEK.  NOBILO SAID THAT THE STATEMENT WOULD NOT WEAKEN </p><p>THE V-10\'S CALL FOR IRAQ TO DISARM, BUT WOULD ALSO MAKE A </p><p>PLEA FOR UNITY WITHIN THE EU AND A UNIFIED POSITION ON IRAQ </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE NORTH ATLANTIC COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) NOBILO REPEATED HIS PLEA FOR PATIENCE; HE EXPECTS </p><p>THAT AFTER THE NEXT BLIX REPORT TO THE UNSC, THE EU COUNCIL </p><p>OF MINISTERS MEETING NEXT WEEK AND CROATIA\'S SUBMISSION OF </p><p>ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, THE GOC WILL BE MORE </p><p>RESPONSIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR WARNED THAT CROATIA NEEDS TO MAKE </p><p>UP ITS OWN MIND; THE LACK OF EU UNITY WOULD CERTAINLY </p><p>CONTINUE PAST NEXT MONDAY; THE TIME FOR ACTION WAS SHORT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE STATEMENT AS RELEASED AFTER THE FEBRUARY 13 </p><p>CABINET MEETING SEEMS TO REPRESENT ACCURATELY THE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MUDDLED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT.  IT </p><p>CALLS FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1441 AND DECLARES THAT </p><p>IRAQI BEHAVIOR WILL DETERMINE "WHETHER THIS CRISIS WILL END </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3663 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------35BF39  131647Z /38 </p><p>O 131645Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9460 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, UN, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: BUCKING UP THE WEAK-KNEED CROATIANS </p><p> </p><p>IN PEACE OR WAR."  BUT THEN THE STATEMENT DRIFTS OFF INTO </p><p>CALLS FOR UNITY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND FOR A UNIFIED </p><p>APPROACH BETWEEN THE EU AND THE U.S.  THE AMBASSADOR IS </p><p>CONTACTING NOBILO TO URGE THAT THE GOC GET ITS FOCUS BACK ON </p><p>THE REAL ISSUE AND OFF OF ITS HAND-WRINGING. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 13 GOC STATEMENT ON IRAQ: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z </p><p> </p><p>GOC POSITION ON IRAQI CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION </p><p>AND HAS SINCE ITS CREATION SOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS ACCORDING TO ITS OWN ABILITIES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>WITHIN OUR REGION.  THROUGHOUT THE YEARS CROATIAN DIPLOMACY </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY AND ACTIVELY WORKED ON BANNING, CONTROLLING </p><p>AND DESTROYING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS CROATIA HAS CLEARLY CALLED ON IRAQ TO </p><p>COOPERATE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WITH UN INSPECTORS AND TO </p><p>COMPLY WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS FROM UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE PERTAINING TO THE </p><p>IDENTIFICATION AND DESTRUCTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION.  CROATIA HAS ITS INSPECTORS IN THE UN TEAM AND </p><p>HAS IN THAT MANNER AND OTHERWISE SOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THIS CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THAT POLICY AND BASED ON ITS FULL SUPPORT TO </p><p>UNSC RESOLUTION 1441, CROATIA HAS JOINED IN A NUMBER OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>IRAQI CRISIS. THE STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTERS </p><p>OF THE VILNIUS GROUP COUNTRIES CONSTITUTES A FORM OF </p><p>ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON IRAQ TO COMPLY WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS </p><p>REGARDING COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTORS AND DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH WAS CROATIA\'S PRIMARY </p><p>MOTIVE WHEN JOINING THE STATEMENT IN SOLIDARITY. </p><p> </p><p>AS A NATO CANDIDATE AND A COUNTRY SCHEDULED TO APPLY FOR EU </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMING DAYS, CROATIA IS PARTICULARLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z </p><p>INTERESTED IN SEEING THE STRENGTHENING OF JOINT EU POLICIES </p><p>ON FOREIGN AND SECURITY MATTERS.  THAT IS WHY CROATIA JOINED </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 4 EU PRESIDENCY DEMARCHE ON IRAQ.  CROATIA </p><p>THEREFORE HOPES THAT THE UPCOMING EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF </p><p>THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WILL RESULT IN A MUCH-NEEDED CONSENSUS </p><p>ON WAYS TO RESOLVE THE IRAQI CRISIS.  WE ARE EQUALLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN THE PRESERVATION AND SOLIDIFICATION OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL UNITY AND TOGETHERNESS OF THE EURO-ATLANTIC REGION. </p><p> STABLE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE E.U. AND THE U.S. - I.E. WITHIN </p><p>THE EURO-ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP - IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF </p><p>PEACE AND STABILITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER, BUT ALSO FOR </p><p>EFFECTIVE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  EURO-ATLANTIC DIALOGUE </p><p>IS ALSO NEEDED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE AND CONTROL ALL POSSIBLE </p><p>ASPECTS OF RESOLVING THE IRAQI CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>CITIZENS OF CROATIA HIGHLY VALUE PEACE AND PEACEFUL POLITICAL </p><p>MEANS FOR RESOLVING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW VERY WELL </p><p>ABOUT THE HORRORS OF WAR AND DESTRUCTION.  THAT\'S WHY CROATIA </p><p>IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN RESOLVING THE CRISIS WITHOUT </p><p>WAR.  STANDING ON ITS PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING FOR WAR AND </p><p>STABILITY IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS FOR THE UNDISPUTABLE ROLE </p><p>OF THE U.N., CROATIA CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT NOT ALL MEANS </p><p>FOR PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE IRAQI CRISIS HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXHAUSTED. THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA WARNS THAT IT DEPENDS ON </p><p>IRAQI BEHAVIOR WHETHER THIS CRISIS WILL END IN PEACE OR WAR. </p><p>THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN CALLING ON IRAQ TO FULLY AND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY COMPLY WITH U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION </p><p>1441.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE EXPRESS BELIEF THAT EVERY </p><p>POSSIBLE MEANS OF RESOLVING THIS CRISIS MUST BE ASSESSED WITH </p><p>REGARD TO WHETHER IT EXPANDS OR NARROWS THE GROUNDS OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  TAKING ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA APPEALS TO THE U.S., EU MEMBER </p><p>COUNTRIES, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF TH </p><p>E ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION TO REACH WITHIN THE U.N. SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL THE MUCH- NEEDED CONSENSUS AND UNITY IN FUTURE </p><p>ACTIVITIES ON RESOLVING THE IRAQI CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
