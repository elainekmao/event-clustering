<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002786 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT--DANIEL GLASER AND SHAUN </p><p>LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2017 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: EMBASSY VIEWS ON LOOMING FATF SANCTIONS </p><p>DECISION </p><p> </p><p>REF: 03OCT02 LONERGAN/TAYLOR TELCON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This is an action message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Embassy understands that an October 1 Washington </p><p>interagency meeting concluded that the USG should recommend </p><p>counter-measures against Nigeria during next week\'s Financial </p><p>Action Task Force (FATF) Plenary session in Paris.  According </p><p>to the USG representative to the FATF, Treasury\'s Shaun </p><p>Lonergan, the GON did not report adequate progress when a GON </p><p>delegation met with the FATF\'s Africa and Middle East Review </p><p>Group (AMERG) on September 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) We agree that the GON did not energetically address the </p><p>issue during most of the year; yet, after months of </p><p>unsuccessful dialogue,  the GON is now motivated to take </p><p>needed steps towards money laundering reform.  President </p><p>Obasanjo has charged his Principal Secretary, Stephen </p><p>Oronsaye and Attorney General Kanu Agabi with leading the </p><p>dialogue with the FATF and with coordinating GON legislative </p><p>and policy reforms.  This seriousness was envinced after the </p><p>FATF and the Embassy warned the President that </p><p>"counter-measures" would be taken if the GON did not show </p><p>genuine progress on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Steps taken during the last four weeks include </p><p>significant amendments to the GON\'s existing Banks and Other </p><p>Financial Institutions (BOFI) Act of 1991 and its Money </p><p>Laundering Act of 1995.  Also, the President submitted a </p><p>revised draft Financial Crimes Commission Bill.  These </p><p>amendments make a number of major improvements, including: </p><p>expanding the scope of money laundering to include the </p><p>proceeds of all crimes; adding "other financial institutions" </p><p>to those required to submit currency transaction reports over </p><p>a threshold of the equivalent of $5,000; and giving the </p><p>Central Bank greater authority to freeze suspicious accounts. </p><p> A stumbling block to finalize the legal reform is the </p><p>lethargy of the National Assembly in passing these and many </p><p>other proposed laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) We feel a credible threat of imminent counter-measures </p><p>is far stronger and will afford much better leverage than the </p><p>actual imposition of those sanctions at this stage.  This </p><p>will encourage the Executive Branch to redouble its efforts </p><p>and will place a great deal of political pressure on members </p><p>of the National Assembly not to let their legislative </p><p>inaction result in the imposition of sanctions on their </p><p>country. Assuming this blame would be something the Assembly </p><p>would like to avoid during an election year, we think the </p><p>legislature would be compelled to act uickly on the proposed </p><p>legislation now before it.  Conversely, implementation of </p><p>sanctions might be counter-productive.   The Executive and </p><p>Legislature are locked in an intense political battle. </p><p>Imposition of sanctions right now would be blamed on the </p><p>President and the Assembly would have no incentive to help </p><p>him resolve the issue even though doing so would be clearly </p><p>in tne country\'s interest.  Again, maintaining the threat of </p><p>sanctions will put an equal onus on both the Executive and </p><p>Legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Additionally, the imposition of sanctions could produce </p><p>a defensive backlash, in which advancing money laundering </p><p>reforms will prove more rather than less difficult.  If the </p><p>USG sanctions will be those contained in the Patriot Act, the </p><p>strain to the bilateral relationship could be significant. </p><p>Because of the anti-terrorism motivation behind the Patriot </p><p>Act, the Nigerians will perceive that we are viewing their </p><p>inaction as some type of implicit support for terrorism. </p><p>This would be unfortunate because Nigeria has been one of our </p><p>strongest anti-terrorism allies in Africa.  Nigerians will </p><p>resent being sanctioned under the  same legal weapon used </p><p>against terrorists and rogue states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) The argument for imposition of counter-measures is </p><p>sound and these measures would hurt Nigeria.  However, we are </p><p>not sure that this is what we want to do.  Diminishing </p><p>Nigeria\'s economcy and economic prospects, at this stage, </p><p>would not appear to be in the U.S. interest.  If our goal is </p><p>to advance money laundering reforms, we should adopt a more </p><p>measured approach.  We propose the USG representative to the </p><p>FATF advocate imposing a tight 60-day deadline for the GON to </p><p>pass (not introduce or consider) required anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation in the National Assembly.  This would </p><p>give the Executive and Legislature time to act on the </p><p>new-found momentum in passing the requisite anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation.  The Embassy would also press key </p><p>leaders in the legislature to move expeditiously on the </p><p>issue.  Failure to pass this legislation would automatically </p><p>trigger the appropriate sanctions under the Patriot Act or </p><p>similar mechanism. </p><p>8.(U) Please advise. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
