<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/ERA AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2014 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EU CONVENTION VICE PRESIDENT AMATO ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM SCOTT KILNER.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON FEBRUARY 3, EU CONVENTION VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT GIULIANO AMATO TOLD AMBASSADOR SEMBLER THAT WHILE </p><p>HE WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE CHANCES OF APPROVING A </p><p>CONSTITUTION BEFORE FORMAL ENLARGEMENT, MUCH WORK REMAINED. </p><p>IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE THAT THE CONVENTION COULD HAVE A </p><p>PRODUCT READY TO PRESENT TO THE JUNE COUNCIL IN THESSALONIKI, </p><p>AND THAT THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE (IGC) COULD </p><p>THEREFORE BEGIN IN TIME TO HAVE A DOCUMENT READY FOR </p><p>SIGNATURE DURING THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY.  AMATO\'S GOAL IS </p><p>TO SIMPLIFY THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE EU.  FOREIGN </p><p>ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, SHOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>INTERACT WITH A SINGLE EU FOREIGN MINISTER.  WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>AN EU "PRESIDENT," AMATO SUGGESTED A "COHABITATION OF COUNCIL </p><p>AND COMMISSION PRESIDENTS UNTIL 2015," ALLOWING TIME FOR THE </p><p>EU TO PHASE IN A SINGLE "EXECUTIVE."  HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>CONVENTION IS CONSIDERING A "DUAL MAJORITY" APPROACH (BOTH </p><p>STATES AND POPULATION) FOR APPROVING LEGISLATION.  FUNDING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS POST-ENLARGEMENT MAY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED </p><p>THROUGH SOME TYPE OF EU "OWN RESOURCES" TAX TO BE COLLECTED </p><p>DIRECTLY BY BRUSSELS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER, WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A/DCM AND </p><p>POLOFF (NOTETAKER), CONGRATULATED AMATO FOR THE CONVENTION\'S </p><p>PROGRESS THUS FAR.  HE ASKED AMATO WHETHER IT WAS ON COURSE </p><p>TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT READY FOR SIGNATURE BY HEADS OF STATE </p><p>BY THE END OF 2003, ONE OF PM BERLUSCONI\'S TOP PRIORITIES FOR </p><p>ITALY\'S JULY-DECEMBER EU PRESIDENCY.  AMATO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THE CONVENTION HAS REACHED CONSENSUS ON SOME TECHNICAL </p><p>CHANGES, SUCH AS GIVING THE EU A SINGLE LEGAL PERSONALITY. </p><p>HOWEVER, AT THE NEXT PLENARY AT THE END OF FEBRUARY, THE </p><p>DELEGATES WILL BEGIN TO WRESTLE WITH SOME OF THE MORE </p><p>CONTENTIOUS ISSUES, INCLUDING OPTIONS TO ABOLISH THE </p><p>SIX-MONTH ROTATING PRESIDENCY.  THERE WAS HARD WORK AHEAD TO </p><p>RECONCILE THOSE MEMBER STATES WHO WANT TO KEEP THE EU AS A </p><p>"JOINT VENTURE," AND THOSE WHO WANT A "MERGER." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE SIZE OF THE CONVENTION ITSELF IS ALSO A FACTOR, </p><p>AMATO CONTINUED. IN THEORY, THE CONVENTION WAS TO BE </p><p>COMPRISED OF ABOUT 100 DELEGATES PLUS ALTERNATES.  IN FACT, </p><p>ALTERNATE AND DELEGATE PARTICIPATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE. </p><p>WHILE THE TEN ASPIRANT COUNTRIES HAVE OBSERVER STATUS, AND </p><p>THEREFORE DO NOT VOTE, THEY PARTICIPATE IN DEBATE IN THE SAME </p><p>MANNER AS FULL MEMBERS.  THE RESULT IS A CONVENTION OF OVER </p><p>200 MEMBERS, WHICH NATURALLY SLOWS DOWN PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  AMATO SAID IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE THAT THE CONVENTION </p><p>COULD HAVE A PRODUCT READY TO PRESENT TO THE JUNE COUNCIL IN </p><p>THESSALONIKI, AND THAT THE IGC COULD THEREFORE BEGIN IN TIME </p><p>TO HAVE A DOCUMENT READY FOR SIGNATURE DURING THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY. BUT WITH AN UNDERTAKING THIS COMPLEX, THERE WERE </p><p>MANY CONTINGENCIES THAT COULD AFFECT TIMING.  BESIDES, </p><p>CONTINUED AMATO IN AN ASIDE, CONVENTION PRESIDENT GISCARD </p><p>D\'ESTAING "LIKES HIS JOB."  THERE WERE SOME MEMBERS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY "NORTHERN COUNTRIES" WHO WANTED A COOLING OFF </p><p>PERIOD BETWEEN THE CONVENTION AND IGC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  FOR AMATO, ANY DELAY THAT WOULD PUSH THE IGC INTO </p><p>THE IRISH PRESIDENCY WAS TROUBLING.  "FOR THE SAKE OF EUROPE, </p><p>THE IGC MUST BE COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION IS PRESENTED TO MEMBER STATES" WITH MINIMAL </p><p>DEBATE BETWEEN.  OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE "AN OVERCOOKED MEAL" </p><p>AND THE MOMENTUM COMING OUT OF THE CONVENTION WILL BE LOST. </p><p>THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS IN 2004, SUCH AS EU PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS AND A NEW COMMISSION, WHICH WILL DISTRACT ATTENTION </p><p>FROM THESE IPORTANT REFORM ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  AMATO HOPED THA ASPIRANT MEMBERS WOULD PARTICIPATE </p><p>AS MUCH AS PSSIBLE, "WITH SOME AMBIGUITY" AS NON-VOTING </p><p>MEMBRS IN THE IGC.  HE DREW COMPARISONS TO 1985/86, WHE </p><p>SPAIN AND PORTUGAL PARTICIPATED "ALMOST AS FULLMEMBERS" IN </p><p>THE DEBATE ON THE SINGLE ACT, THEN SIGNED THE TREATY AFTER </p><p>THEIR FORMAL ENTRY INTO THE EU.  ACCORDING TO AMATO, THE </p><p>POLES LOOK FAVORABLY ON SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  AMATO\'S GOAL IS TO SIMPLIFY THE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURE OF THE EU, DEVELOPED INCREMENTALLY OVER 50 YEARS, </p><p>TREATY UPON TREATY, EACH WITH ITS OWN "JUNGLE" OF </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC INSTRUMENTS.   FOREIGN ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH A SINGLE </p><p>PERSONALITY AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE EU.  AMATO </p><p>ENVISAGES AN EVENTUAL MERGER OF THE CFSP HIGH REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>(SOLANA) AND COMMISSION EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMISSIONER </p><p>(PATTEN) POSITIONS, INTO A SINGLE "DOUBLE-HATTED" EU FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER.  THE PRESIDENCY WILL BE A TRICKIER ISSUE.
