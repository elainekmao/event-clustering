IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p>(UNDP) RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO CONVENED </p><p>A MEETING OF DIPLOMATIC HEADS OF MISSION MARCH 28 TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER (REFTEL).  MOST OF THE DIPLOMATS </p><p>SAID THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE GAVE THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY PRECIOUS LITTLE WITH WHICH TO WORK, </p><p>ALTHOUGH SOME SAW MERIT IN THE FACT THAT IT ANSWERED </p><p>AT ALL.  IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE DONORS WERE </p><p>UNSYMPATHETIC WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S PLEA FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE ON THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, A </p><p>NON-NEGOTIABLE ITEM.  THE LETTER\'S FAILURE TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE ISSUE OF RULE OF LAW IN THE BROADEST SENSE WAS THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL CONCERN OF MOST DONORS.  THEY ASKED ANGELO </p><p>TO CONTINUE ENGAGING THE GOVERNMENT, PUTTING ACROSS </p><p>THEIR CONCERNS AND ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION OF SOME </p><p>THE TERMS USED IN THE LETTER.  ALTHOUGH THE MALLOCH- </p><p>BROWN INITIATIVE APPEARS TO BE COLLAPSING, THE VICTIM </p><p>OF THE UNDP\'S MISBEGOTTEN ROLE OF TACKLING THE LAND </p><p>QUESTION INSTEAD OF RULE OF LAW, WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE IN THE UTILITY OF DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01169  01 OF 02  291504Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO </p><p>CONVENED DIPLOMATIC HEADS OF MISSION ON MARCH 28 FOR A </p><p>DISCUSSION ON THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S RESPONSE TO </p><p>UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MALLOCH-BROWN\'S DECEMBER 15 LETTER </p><p>TO PRESIDENT MUGABE (REFTEL).  THERE WERE BASICALLY </p><p>TWO GROUPS: THOSE WHO WERE VERY NEGATIVE (UK, GERMANY, </p><p>NETHERLANDS, AND CANADA), AND THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING </p><p>FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE IN THE RESPONSE (ITALY, FRANCE, </p><p>BELGIUM AND ARGENTINA).  (COMMENT: THE LIKELY DONORS </p><p>ARE IN THE FORMER, NOT THE LATTER GROUP. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POSITIVE ASPECTS, AS PITCHED BY ANGELO, WERE </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE RESPONDED (RATHER THAN </p><p>IGNORED THE LETTER), USED DIPLOMATIC LANGUAGE, AND </p><p>ENDORSED CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH THE DONORS, BUT </p><p>WITHOUT SPECIFYING MODALITIES.  SOME DONORS WELCOMED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACCEPTANCE OF A TRUST FUND (WHICH IS </p><p>PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION) AND ESTABLISHING A </p><p>TECHNICAL UNIT WITHIN THE OFFICES OF THE UNDP, BUT NO </p><p>ONE INDICATED THEY ARE READY TO OFFER FUNDING. </p><p>(COMMENT: NEITHER THE BRITISH NOR WE ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>SUPPORT A TECHNICAL UNIT WITHIN UNDP AT THIS TIME </p><p>BECAUSE IT IS IN THE WRONG PLACE: IT ESTABLISHES DONOR </p><p>AND NOT ZIMBABWEAN CAPACITY.  MOREOVER, ANY TECHNICAL </p><p>SUPPORT UNIT AT THIS TIME WOULD SUPPORT THE FAST-TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  END COMMENT.)  THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>APPEAL TO CONTINUED DIALOGUE WAS UNANIMOUSLY VIEWED AS </p><p>A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEARTH OF </p><p>THOSE WHO CONSIDER IT LITTLE MORE THAN AND A COMBINED </p><p>PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORT AND DELAYING TACTIC.  ON THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01169  01 OF 02  291504Z </p><p>ISSUE OF DIALOGUE, VIRTUALLY ALL THE DONORS WANT A </p><p>TIMEFRAME SPELLED OUT FOR THE PROCESS, REALIZING THAT </p><p>DELAY (AS THE LETTER\'S 90 DAY PLUS TURNAROUND HAS </p><p>SHOWN) ONLY WIDENS THE GULF AND PLAYS INTO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL GAME PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE, MOST OBSERVERS AGREED </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S POSITION HAS NOT </p><p>CHANGED AND OBSERVED THAT THE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE REMAINS NON-NEGOTIABLE.  THE BRITISH HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER POINTED OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION </p><p>IN THE UNDP PLAN THAT APPROACHES THE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM AS A DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE, RATHER THAN A </p><p>POLITICAL POWER PLAY.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESPONSE IGNORES THE CORE ISSUE OF THE RULE OF LAW, </p><p>EXCEPT FOR THE CLAIM THAT ITS FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE IS FULLY LEGAL, AN ASSERTION THAT THE </p><p>CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER DESCRIBED AS </p><p>"BREATHTAKING."   THE RESPONSE LETTER YIELDS NO </p><p>CONCESSIONS TO DONOR CONCERNS AND MAKES THE ABSURD </p><p>CLAIM THAT 60,000 FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN RESETTLED </p><p>ON TWO MILLION HECTARES IN UNDER ONE YEAR\'S TIME. </p><p>FINALLY, THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BLAMES EVERYONE </p><p>(E.G., THE DONORS AND THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION) </p><p>EXCEPT ITSELF FOR ITS CURRENT PREDICAMENT, AND FAILS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3026 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01169  02 OF 02  291504Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  BBG-00   R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------D8D114  291504Z /38 </p><p>O 291508Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8533 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A-AA/AFR - V.

MANY HEADS OF MISSION HAD DIFFICULTY </p><p>VIEWING FAVORABLY THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S REQUEST </p><p>FOR ASSISTANCE TO CLEAN UP THE MESS CREATED BY ITS </p><p>FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, ABOUT WHICH THE </p><p>DONORS HAD WARNED IT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THERE WAS CONSENSUS THAT IT WAS PREMATURE TO </p><p>BEGIN ASSISTING THE GOZ\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAS NOT </p><p>ADDRESSED THE DONORS\' CONCERNS WITH THE RESPECT TO THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW.  NEVERTHELESS, ALL DONORS EXPRESSED THE </p><p>DESIRE TO FOSTER DIALOGUE WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME </p><p>FRAME WITH BOTH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM, A POSSIBLE </p><p>VEHICLE FOR SUCH ENGAGEMENT.  THE DONORS REQUESTED </p><p>VICTOR ANGELO TO SEEK CLARIFICATION ON THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NECF AND THE CABINET LAND </p><p>COMMITTEE.  REGARDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, THE </p><p>DONORS INSISTED THAT A CLEAR DISTINCTION HAD TO BE </p><p>MADE BETWEEN THAT FOR THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM (I.E., </p><p>THE MAN-MADE CRISIS) AND THAT FOR NATURAL DISASTERS </p><p>(I.E., DROUGHTS AND FLOODS). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ANGELO AGREED TO CONSULT WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BEGINNING MARCH 30 AND PUT ACROSS THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01169  02 OF 02  291504Z </p><p>DONORS\' VIEWS.  HE WILL EXPLORE AMBIGUITIES IN THE </p><p>LETTER, INCLUDING WHAT PRECISELY THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT MEANS BY ITS LABELING OF THE CHAOTIC </p><p>PROCESS AS A "LEGAL (HOW IT UNDERSTANDS THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW), TRANSPARENT AND EQUITABLE (BENEFICIARY </p><p>SELECTION) LAND REFORM PROGRAM."  THE UNDP RESREP </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PACKAGE HIS POINTS IN </p><p>SUCH A WAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SLAM THE DOOR </p><p>IN HIS FACE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: WE HAVE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THE </p><p>UNDP\'S APPROACH TO THIS ENTERPRISE.  RATHER THAN </p><p>TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE LAND QUESTION, IT </p><p>SHOULD HAVE TACKLED THE OVER-ARCHING ISSUE OF THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW THAT WILL TRIP UP ANY DONOR HEADQUARTERS AND </p><p>MOST LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES.  THE UNITED NATIONS IS THE </p><p>BEST PLACED, IF NOT THE ONLY, ORGANIZATION ABLE TO DO </p><p>SO.  THE UNITED NATIONS WAS TRAPPED INTO TAKING ON THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE, A FACT THAT HAS PLAYED INTO THE HANDS OF </p><p>THE GOZ, WHICH HAS MADE A RHETORICAL DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW ON THE FARMS AND THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW IN GENERAL.  THIS IS A NON-STARTER, AND ANGELO HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN ABLE TO QUASH THIS CYNICAL DIFFERENTIATION. </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT LAND REFORM IS AN INTERNAL ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MATTER, AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FRANK AND OPEN </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS.  WE SEE NO </p><p>PERCENTAGE IN GETTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A GOZ-CFU </p><p>DIALOGUE, FOR EXAMPLE.  THE MALLOCH-BROWN INITIATIVE </p><p>APPEARS TO BE COLLAPSING, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE IN THE UTILITY OF GENUINE DIALOGUE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01169  02 OF 02  291504Z </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
