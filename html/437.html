HIS COMMENTS ON THE COUNTRY\'S SITUATION WERE </p><p>TERSE BUT REALISTIC.  HE EXPRESSED DETERMINATION TO CARRY </p><p>ON BUT GAVE NO HINT OF ANY GAMEPLAN AND LAPSED ONCE </p><p>INTO FATALISM.  HE SEEMED TO BE IN GOOD PHYSICAL AND </p><p>MENTAL HEALTH BUT NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN EXTENDED </p><p>DISCUSSION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE RECEIVED ME AT MY REQUEST </p><p>DECEMBER 27, 1990.  MY OBJECTIVE IN SEEKING THE MEETING, </p><p>THE FIRST SINCE I PRESENTED MY CREDENTIALS IN SEPTEMBER, </p><p>WAS TO MAKE A PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF MIND </p><p>OF A CHIEF OF STATE WHOM ONE NEVER SEES IN PUBLIC AND </p><p>ONLY IN THE MOST FORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES ON TELEVISION. </p><p>WE MET AT VILLA SOMALIA IN A BUILDING AND ROOM ONCE </p><p>USED BY THE CABINET FOR ITS SESSIONS.  SIAD ARRIVED </p><p>AFTER I DID AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY VICE MINISTER </p><p>BASI FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED </p><p>AIDE.  I WAS ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  LEFT TO INITIATE THE DISCUSSION, I TOLD SIAD I HAD </p><p>ASKED TO SEE HIM BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN NO OCCASION </p><p>TO SPEAK FOR THREE MONTHS AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO BRIEF </p><p>HIM ON RECENT USG DECISIONS REGARDING SOMALIA, TO AVOID </p><p>THE DANGER OF MISINTERPRETATION.  AS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>NODDED, I EXPLAINED THAT OUR RECENT EVACUATION OF </p><p>NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL HAD MADE IT NECESSARY TO </p><p>SUSPEND OUR CIVIL AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH </p><p>WE WOULD RESUME ONCE SECURITY CONDITIONS MADE IT </p><p>POSSIBLE.  AS SIAD OFFERED NO COMMENT, I THEN TOLD HIM </p><p>WE WERE WITHDRAWING FUEL, EQUIPMENT AND USG CONTRACT </p><p>PERSONNEL FROM BERBERA, DUE TO PERSIAN GULF REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  SIAD\'S RESPONSE, WHEN I FINISHED MY BRIEF PRESENTA- </p><p>TION, WAS THE APPARENTLY SERIOUS COMMENT. "O GOOD, I </p><p>THOUGH YOU WERE COMING TO SAY GOODBYE AND TO TELL ME </p><p>THE OTHER AMERICANS ALSO WERE LEAVING".  CONTINUING, </p><p>HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THE DECISIONS I HAD </p><p>DESCRIBED.  DESCRIBING THE CURRENT SITUATION IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY AS "BAD", THE PRESIDENT ADDED, "AND I AM </p><p>A LITTLE BIT OLD".  HE CONCLUDED HIS RESPONSE WITH THE </p><p>COMMENT, "AND WE DON\'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN". </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES I TRIED TO DRAW THE </p><p>ELDERLY PRESIDENT INTO CONVERSATION BUT COULD ELICIT </p><p>ONLY BRIEF RESPONSES TO THE SUBJECTS I RAISED.  HE </p><p>WAS ANXIOUS TO TERMINATE THE MEETING AND PROBABLY WOULD </p><p>HAVE DONE SO, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE JUICE HE HAD </p><p>OFFERED HAD NOT YET ARRIVED.  WHEN I MENTIONED USG </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE </p><p>AND ASKED IF SOME OTHER INITIATIVE WERE UNDERWAY, </p><p>SIAD REPLIED, "THEY CAN COME HERE AND TALK IF THEY </p><p>WANT TO".  ASKED IF HE WAS LOOKING FOR ANY FURTHER HELP </p><p>FROM THE USG OR OTHER NATIONS IN PROMOTING PEACEFUL </p><p>RECONCILIATION, HIS COMMENT WAS THAT "GOD HELPS THOSE </p><p>WHO HELP THEMSELVES".  WHEN I NOTED THE PASSAGE OF </p><p>THE LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING GROUNDRULES FOR THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF POLITICAL PARTIES, HE SAID HE THOUGHT </p><p>ONE OR TWO ALREADY HAD REGISTERED.  THEN HE HAD AN </p><p>APPARENTLY INCONCLUSIVE EXCHANGE IN SOMALI WITH HIS </p><p>AIDES ON THE SUBJECT.  HE REPEATED AGAIN THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY WAS BAD, NOTING AT ONE POINT THAT </p><p>WHAT HAPPENS IS "UP TO GOD". </p><p> </p><p>7. AFTER OUR JUICE ARRIVED, AND APPARENTLY JUST TO MAKE </p><p>CONVERSATION, SIAD SAID HE UNDERSTOOD PRESIDENT BUSH TOO </p><p>WAS IN TROUBLE.  WHEN I ASKED HIM TO ELABORATE, HE </p><p>ASKED INSTEAD WHEN THE PRESIDENT WILL LAUNCH THE ATTACK </p><p>ON IRAQ.  WITH A SMILE I TOLD HIM THAT THE DATE HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN SHARED WITH THE EMBASSY.  WE THEN EXCHANGED NEW </p><p>YEARS GREETINGS AND PARTED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  SIAD\'S STRIDE WAS VIGOROUS FOR A MAN IN </p><p>HIS EIGHTIES, HIS HANDSHAKE WAS FIRM, AND HIS MIND </p><p>WAS ALERT.  HAVING HAD TO LISTEN THE PREVIOUS DAY TO </p><p>THE SOMALI AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON INSIST FOR AN HOUR </p><p>THAT THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY IS IN ALL IMPORTANT </p><p>RESPECTS NORMAL, AND HAVING BEEN TOLD BY ADMIRAL MARINO </p><p>THAT PEACE HAD RETURNED TO THE NORTHWEST AS WE </p><p>CHATTED WHILE I WAITED FOR SIAD, I WAS SURPRISED BY THE </p><p>PRESLDENT\'S   REALISM IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE REGIME\'S </p><p>PLIGHT.  HOWEVER, HE IS CONSIDERABLY SMARTER THAN MY </p><p>OTHER TWO INTERLOCUTORS AND CERTAINLY WISE ENOUGH  TO </p><p>REALIZE HE WOULD HAVE NO CREDIBILITY PRETENDING TO </p><p>ANYONE LIVING IN MOGADISHU THAT CONDITIONS HERE </p><p>RESEMBLE NORMALCY.  RECOGNIZING OUR PREOCCUPATION WITH </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, HE PROBABLY ALSO SAW NO </p><p>MILEAGE IN TOUTING THE REGIME\'S MILITARY AND POLICE </p><p>INITIATIVES.  PERHAPS HE RECOGNIZES THEIR LIMITATIONS. </p><p>MY GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT I WAS DEALING WITH A </p><p>WORRIED MAN WHO DOES NOT FEEL HE HAS A GAMEPLAN WHICH </p><p>WILL ALLOW HIM TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS BEFORE HIM. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS HE SEEMED INTENT TO MUDDLE ON, GIVING NO </p><p>HINT THAT HE MIGHT BE THINKING OF HEADING TOWARD THE </p><p>EXIT. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
