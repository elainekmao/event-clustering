(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid contacted the </p><p>Ambassador on June 2 to convey information about </p><p>the UAEG\'s ongoing assistance to Jordan and </p><p>Morocco.  With regard to Jordan, Hamdan reported </p><p>that the UAE has agreed to continue supporting </p><p>Jordan\'s oil needs for the next three months. </p><p>Hamdan indicated the level of support would </p><p>continue to be the cash equivalent of 25,000 </p><p>barrels per day.  The UAE began helping to fill </p><p>Jordan\'s oil needs at the outbreak of hostilities </p><p>with Iraq in March.  While the Jordanians, in </p><p>recent representations to the UAE, asked for </p><p>support to cover the next year, Hamdan advised that </p><p>the UAE, due to its own financial crunch, would </p><p>only be able to provide assistance for the next </p><p>three months. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan also informed the Ambassador that, </p><p>following the terror attacks in Casablanca, the </p><p>UAEG provided $40 million in cash assistance to </p><p>Morocco.  The Moroccans intend to use the money to </p><p>purchase much needed equipment.  The Emiratis have </p><p>asked the Moroccans to provide an accounting for </p><p>the money spent.  Hamdan confided that he had told </p><p>his Kuwaiti and Saudi counterparts the UAE\'s </p><p>donation was $80 million, in an effort to encourage </p><p>them to give more.  He wanted to make sure that the </p><p>USG knew the real UAE contribution, in the event </p><p>that this is raised with us. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT:  Jordan and Morocco both enjoy </p><p>extremely close ties to the UAE.  The Emiratis have </p><p>long felt it important to provide economic </p><p>assistance and support to these two moderate Arab </p><p>states.  The fact that Abu Dhabi is offering cash </p><p>assistance, vice assistance-in-kind, is a measure </p><p>of just how close these ties are since the Emiratis </p><p>usually balk at writing checks.  The UAE\'s strong </p><p>official ties with Jordan and Morocco are bolstered </p><p>by personal relationships between the ruling </p><p>families. Jordanian King Abdullah II is a close </p><p>friend of UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad </p><p>bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ).  The two frequently hunt </p><p>-- in Morocco and Tanzania -- joined, more often </p><p>than not, by England\'s Prince Andrew.  The ties </p><p>with the Moroccan monarch are equally warm.  Shaykh </p><p>Zayid and other Emirati ruling family members </p><p>maintain vacation palaces in Morocco and have </p><p>poured money into assistance projects there.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
