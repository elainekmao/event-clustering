<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001372 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, MARR, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S ARMY SETS UP HUMAN RIGHTS CELL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal\'s army has set up a cell to </p><p>investigate reported human rights violations, the Defense </p><p>Ministry announced July 10.  A high-ranking officer agreed to </p><p>consider offers of USG assistance for the newly-created </p><p>office.  The cell has reportedly been established because </p><p>human rights inquiries have become too numerous for senior </p><p>officers to handle.  Human rights groups welcomed the news </p><p>and planned to offer assistance to the RNA.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) has set up a human </p><p>rights cell under its Adjutant General Department to </p><p>investigate reports of human rights violations, a July 10 </p><p>Defense Ministry press release announced. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The RNA Chief of General Staff (CGS) gave ODCOff </p><p>advance notice of the announcement during a July 10 briefing </p><p>on U.S. security assistance.  The CGS stated that the cell </p><p>would include representatives from the offices of the RNA\'s </p><p>Director of Public Relations, Judge Advocate General and </p><p>Military Police.  Col. Deepak Gurung, Director of Public </p><p>Relations, would serve as the primary point of contact for </p><p>the cell.  (Note:  At the time of the announcement Col. </p><p>Gurung was in the U.S. on a single country project IVP </p><p>program on "Government Public Affairs."  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The new human rights cell has not yet received any </p><p>international assistance or advice, the CGS noted.  ODCOff </p><p>proposed arranging for an advisor from the Center for </p><p>Civilian-Military Relations (CCMR) to come to Nepal to assist </p><p>with the program.  The CGS agreed that that was a good idea. </p><p>He added that the cell "works with ICRC."  (Note:  Although </p><p>the RNA has agreed in principle to cooperate with ICRC, ICRC </p><p>maintains that it still does not have access to RNA </p><p>detainees.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The RNA Director of Military Operations (DMO) told </p><p>DATT that he had set up the cell because the volume of human </p><p>rights inquiries had become too large for his office to </p><p>handle.  He stressed that he planned to ensure that the cell </p><p>was sufficiently staffed and funded. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Kapil Shrestha, member of the GON\'s National Human </p><p>Rights Commission, told us the army\'s new approach was </p><p>"encouraging."  "We encourage them to adopt a responsive </p><p>stance on human rights," he added, and would be willing to </p><p>collaborate on training and materials.  Human rights groups </p><p>also welcomed the announcement.  Representatives of the Human </p><p>Rights Organization of Nepal (HURON) told Ambassador July 12 </p><p>that they planned to meet with the RNA in coming days to </p><p>discuss the cell and offer assistance. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  So far, the RNA has moved slowly to address </p><p>reports of rights violations.  That RNA top brass have taken </p><p>pains to express support for the new human rights cell is </p><p>welcome news, perhaps indicating that Mission efforts to </p><p>focus the RNA\'s attention on potential human rights problems </p><p>are paying off.  Post will watch closely for signs that the </p><p>new mechanism is in fact speeding the RNA\'s response to </p><p>complaints.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
