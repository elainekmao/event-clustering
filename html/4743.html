<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: DEFMIN HOPES FOR DECISION ON IRAQ WITHIN DAYS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECDEF 122341 DEC 02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson, reasons 1.5, </p><p>b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: In an introductory call on the new Minister </p><p>of National Defense Mehmet Vecdi Gonul December 16, </p><p>Ambassador emphasized the positive outcome of AK Party Leader </p><p>Erdogan\'s visit to Washington, the resolution of Turkey\'s </p><p>participation agreement with the EU on ESDP, progress on </p><p>Turkey\'s eventual accession to the EU, and the invitation for </p><p>Bulgaria and Romania to join NATO.  Nevertheless he noted the </p><p>importance of Turkey\'s coming to a decision on whether to </p><p>support a military operation against Iraq if one becomes </p><p>necessary.  Gonul praised the support of the US for Turkey\'s </p><p>EU candidacy and expressed appreciation for the warm </p><p>reception Erdogan received in Washington.  He noted he had </p><p>passed notes on his conversation with USDP Feith (reftel) to </p><p>both PM Gul and Erdogan before they went to Copenhagen and he </p><p>hoped his leadership would make a decision on Iraq the </p><p>evening of December 16 and meet with Gonul December 17 upon </p><p>their return to Ankara.  Gonul noted that the philosophy of </p><p>the decision had been made but the public and the parliament </p><p>needed to be prepared.  He added that "this week would be </p><p>very important" comparing it to Turkey\'s decision regarding </p><p>entry into WWII and NATO membership.  Gonul\'s aide ADM (L) </p><p>Can Erenoglu noted the ONW renewal was being processed </p><p>normally and did not foresee any problems.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Ambassador called on Minister of National Defense </p><p>Gonul December 16 to congratulate him on his appointment.  He </p><p>emphasized that, while the EU was not as forthcoming at </p><p>Copenhagen as we had hoped, the resolution of a participation </p><p>agreement with the EU on ESDP and AK Party Leader Erdogan\'s </p><p>visit to Washington had been extremely valuable.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that POTUS appreciated the opportunity to </p><p>establish a personal rapport with Erdogan.  He explained that </p><p>Erdogan had been briefed on Iraqi WMD, US military plans and </p><p>the number of coalition partners that support the US with or </p><p>without a second UN resolution.  It had been made clear to </p><p>Erdogan, however, that eventually the lack of a "yes" from </p><p>Turkey on Iraq would, for all intents and purposes, be a </p><p>"no."  The US respects that Turkey has some serious decisions </p><p>to make, but we are running out of time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Gonul began by expressing appreciation for US support </p><p>for Turkey\'s EU accession aspirations and for Erdogan\'s warm </p><p>reception in Washington, despite his not being the prime </p><p>minister of Turkey.  He emphasized the difficulties of making </p><p>such an important decision on Iraq, akin to Turkey\'s </p><p>decisions on entering WWII or joining NATO, when virtually </p><p>every parliamentarian was new.  Gonul added that Iraq had not </p><p>been discussed during the campaign in Turkey and, therefore, </p><p>the government needed "to get the Turkish public and the </p><p>parliament behind us."  He said the "philosophical background </p><p>of the decision had already been made" but the public needed </p><p>to be prepared.  After his very fruitful discussions with </p><p>USDP Feith in Rome on the margins of the SEDM, Gonul had </p><p>passed 2-3 pages of notes to Erdogan and PM Gul at the </p><p>airport on their way to Copenhagen.  He hoped his leadership </p><p>would make a decision on Iraq the evening of December 16 and </p><p>meet with Gonul December 17 when they got back to Ankara.  He </p><p>expressed optimism about a decision on Iraq and said this </p><p>week would be "very important." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador thanked Gonul for the encouraging news </p><p>and reminded him that the Embassy had submitted its request </p><p>to renew Operation Northern Watch\'s presence in Turkey for </p><p>another six months.  Gonul\'s aide ADM(L) Erenogul assured the </p><p>Ambassador the request was being processed normally.  He said </p><p>the PM or FM would likely speak on the issue and evinced no </p><p>hint that he expected any problems with the renewal in </p><p>parliament.  The Ambassador asked to be kept informed of its </p><p>progress and underlined that the ONW renewal should be kept </p><p>separated from larger issues on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Regarding the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, Gonul </p><p>said Turkey would have preferred a better outcome but at </p><p>least the country has a concrete goal that he hoped would </p><p>motivate the population.  Gonul acknowledged that the US </p><p>supported Turkey\'s candidacy although Turkey\'s membership </p><p>would probably disadvantage the US in the short term.  The </p><p>Ambassador underlined that our support for Turkey\'s </p><p>membership was a strategic, vice tactical, interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: While traditionally the MND is somewhat </p><p>marginalized on most security issues except procurement, </p><p>Gonul was clearly focused on the larger policy issues facing </p><p>Turkey such as Iraq and EU membership.  He was not well </p><p>briefed on specific procurement programs to which the </p><p>previous MND was strictly confined.  Nevertheless, his </p><p>experience in government, his ability to grasp issues </p><p>quickly, and AK\'s interest in redressing the current </p><p>imbalance in civilian-military relations may over time </p><p>increase the role of MND in Turkey\'s policy-making apparatus. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
