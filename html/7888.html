END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>TEXT OF WFP PROPOSAL FOR G8 CONSIDERATION RELATED TO </p><p>PREVENTING AND MITIGATING FOOD CRISES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) BEGIN WFP TEXT. "RECURRING FOOD CRISES IN SUB- </p><p>SAHARAN AFRICA ARE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES FACING </p><p>THE WORLD COMMUNITY TODAY.  EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS, </p><p>CONFLICT, FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND THE DEVASTATING </p><p>IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS HAVE COMBINED TO CREATE MASSIVE NEEDS </p><p>REQUIRING URGENT ACTION.  THE DRAMA SURROUNDING RECENT SHORT- </p><p>TERM CRISES OBSCURES THE MORE \'SILENT\' DISASTERS SUCH AS </p><p>CHRONIC CHILD MALNUTRITION AND LACK OF EDUCATION THAT </p><p>UNDERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF AFRICA\'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE - </p><p>ITS CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>ABOUT 196 MILLION AFRICANS ARE UNDERNOURISHED, WITH OVER 40 </p><p>MILLION NOW SUFFERING SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGES.  THEY NEED </p><p>IMMEDIATE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, AS WELL AS PROGRAMMES TO </p><p>IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH, TRAIN AND EDUCATE WORKFORCES, REDUCE </p><p>THE VULNERABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DISASTERS AND PROMOTE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  HOWEVER, MONEY ALONE IS NOT A </p><p>GUARANTOR OF SUCCESS.  AFRICAN LEADERS WILL NEED TO COMMIT </p><p>TO BUILDING DEMOCRATIC NATIONS WITH LEADERS WHO ARE </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR CITIZENS AND TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT </p><p>SOUND POLICIES THAT DRAW PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PROMOTE </p><p>    ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THEY MUST ALSO COMMIT MORE OF THEIR OWN </p><p>RESOURCES IN AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND SAFETY NETS FOR </p><p>VULNERABLE GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEPAD INITIATIVE IS AN EXCELLENT SIGN OF THE POSITIVE </p><p>COMMITMENT AMONG SOME AFRICAN LEADERS TOWARDS THE </p><p>CONTINENT\'S DEVELOPMENT.  IT DESERVES THE FULL SUPPORT OF G8 </p><p>MEMBERS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE G8 AFRICA ACTION PLAN </p><p>PROVIDE FRAMEWORKS FOR EXPANDED PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA TO </p><p>PROMOTE PEACE, SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT - ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS </p><p>FOR CRISIS PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>PREVENTING AND RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO FOOD CRISES IN </p><p>AFRICA WILL REQUIRE INITIATIVES INVOLVING A RANGE OF ACTORS. </p><p>FOR INSTANCE, INEQUITIES IN TRADE THAT WORK AGAINST THE </p><p>AFRICAN FARMER AND CREATE DISINCENTIVES FOR AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTION WILL NEED TO BE REVERSED.  THIS WILL REQUIRE </p><p>SOUND NATIONAL AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES, IMPROVED </p><p>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY, SKILLS AND INPUTS AND INVESTMENTS </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001958  002 OF 005 </p><p> </p><p> PRODUCED.  ALSO, THE G8 </p><p>SHOULD REINVIGORATE ITS POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH AFRICA, </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH ITS COMMITMENTS IN KANANASKIS, TO HELP </p><p>RESOLVE EXISTING CONFLICTS AND PREVENT NEW ONES. </p><p> </p><p>THIS PAPER CONTAINS A NUMBER OF NEAR TERM AND SPECIFIC IDEAS </p><p>ON WHAT WFP AND ITS PARTNERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>CAN DO AS PART OF THIS BROADER STRATEGY, TO MAKE EMERGENCY </p><p>RESPONSES TO FOOD CRISES MORE EFFECTIVE AND BUILD THE </p><p>CAPACITY OF AFRICAN NATIONS THEMSELVES TO PREVENT THEM. </p><p> </p><p>I.  IMMEDIATE AND FEASIBLE ACTIONS </p><p> </p><p>(A)  FULLY FUND CURRENT HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>WFP\'S EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ALREADY FALL SHORT OF TOTAL </p><p>NEEDS IN AFRICA.  AS OF APRIL 2003, WFP NEEDED AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>    U.S. DOLLARS 1 BILLION TO PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE SOME 1.9 </p><p>MILLION TONS OF EMERGENCY FOOD AID TO CRISIS-AFFECTED </p><p>AFRICANS. WFP\'S TOTAL AFRICA PORTFOLIO FOR EMERGENCIES </p><p>STANDS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF USD 1.8 BILLION, </p><p>EQUIVALENT TO THE TOTAL RESOURCES WFP RECEIVED WORLD-WIDE </p><p>FOR ALL PROJECTS AND OPERATIONS IN 2002. (NOTE: UPDATED WFP </p><p>FIGURES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON MAY 9. END NOTE.)  TO MAXIMIZE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS, THE LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF WFP </p><p>AND OTHER UN AGENCIES IN WATER, SANITATION, HEALTH, </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS ALSO DESERVE INCREASED </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>(B) `TWINNING.\' - FACILITATE FOOD AID DONATIONS FROM NEW </p><p>DONORS </p><p> </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL FOOD SURPLUSES EXIST IN SOME DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BECOMING FOOD AID DONORS, </p><p>BUT MOST LACK THE ASSOCIATED CASH TO PAY FOR FOOD DELIVERY </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION.  G8 AND OTHER DONORS COULD HELP DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES BECOME FOOD AID DONORS BY ESTABLISHING A FUND TO </p><p>MATCH COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMERGING DONORS WITH THE </p><p>ASSOCIATED CASH FOR TRANSPORT, STORAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF DONATED COMMODITIES.  CASH CONTRIBUTIONS MADE </p><p>IN THIS WAY CAN LEVERAGE CONSIDERABLY MORE FOOD AID FOR </p><p>HUNGRY PEOPLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, A CASH CONTRIBUTION OF U.S. </p><p>DOLLARS 20 MILLION COULD LEVERAGE A DONATION OF 100,000 </p><p>METRIC TONS FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR DROUGHT VICTIMS IN ZAMBIA. </p><p>THIS TRANSACTION WOULD OTHERWISE COST AROUND U.S. DOLLARS 40 </p><p>MILLION. OUR SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL </p><p>FUND WITHIN WFP NAMED `THE G-8 FUND FOR EMERGING DONORS\'. </p><p>THE FUND WOULD BE FINANCED BY G-8 MEMBERS BUT NON-G-8 </p><p>    MEMBERS WOULD BE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE. THE FUND COULD BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED AT USD 500 MILLION, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT </p><p>ONE QUARTER OF WFP\'S EXPENDITURE IN 2002. (NOTE. IT WOULD </p><p>ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN </p><p>ENDOWMENT FUND. AN ENDOWMENT WOULD INVOLVE MUCH LARGER </p><p>INITIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT POOR </p><p>INVESTMENT CLIMATE. IT WOULD, HOWEVER, REDUCE THE NEED FOR </p><p>REGULAR REPLENISHMENT. END NOTE.)  THE FUND WOULD BE </p><p>SEPARATELY MANAGED AND ACCOUNTED FOR BY WFP; AND IT WOULD BE </p><p>SUBJECT TO AUDIT ACCORDING TO WFP\'S FINANCIAL REGULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(C) IMPROVE THE CAPACITY FOR EARLY RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>A KEY TO SAVING LIVES AND REDUCING FUTURE NEEDS IN A CRISIS </p><p>IS TO RESPOND EARLY, BEFORE PEOPLE SELL THEIR ASSETS OR GO </p><p>INTO DEBT, MAKING THEMSELVES EVEN MORE VULNERABLE IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  WFP ALREADY HAS A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO PROVIDE </p><p>FUNDING FOR THE EARLIEST PHASES OF AN OPERATION, A REVOLVING </p><p>AND REPLENISHABLE FUND CALLED THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACCOUNT </p><p>(IRA). HOWEVER, THIS USD 35 MILLION FUND, ESTABLISHED SOME </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001958  003 OF 005 </p><p> </p><p>OVER ONLY TWO WEEKS WORTH OF </p><p>FOOD IN OUR CURRENT EMERGENCY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. WHAT WE </p><p>NOW NEED IS A USD 300 MILLION AFRICAN FOOD EMERGENCY FUND, </p><p>WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FAST ACCESS TO CASH AT THE OUTSET OF A </p><p>FOOD CRISIS. THIS WOULD VASTLY STRENGTHEN THE SPEED WITH </p><p>WHICH WFP CAN RESPOND, ALLOWING WFP TO BUY FOOD </p><p>LOCALLY/REGIONALLY, HIRE TRANSPORT, SET UP COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>AND FILL BREAKS IN FOOD AID PIPELINES. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE </p><p>OTHER UN AGENCIES TO SEEK SIMILAR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE </p><p>ACCOUNTS FOR AFRICA AS WE HAVE REPEATEDLY SEEN THAT </p><p>DONATIONS TO MEET NON FOOD NEEDS - CLEAN WATER, MEDICINES, </p><p>SEEDS - MATERIALISE AT AN EVEN SLOWER RATE THAN THOSE FOR </p><p>FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>(D) ESTABLISH A FAMINE RISK INSURANCE SCHEME </p><p> </p><p>DONORS TEND TO CONTRIBUTE GENERALLY TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE, </p><p>    BUT THEIR DONATIONS TRICKLE IN OVER THE LIFE-TIME OF A </p><p>PROJECT, CAUSING PLANNING PROBLEMS AND BREAKS IN THE FOOD </p><p>PIPELINE.  WFP IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A "FAMINE RISK </p><p>INSURANCE SCHEME", WHICH WOULD SHIFT THE BURDEN OF RISK - </p><p>CAUSED BY UNEVEN FUNDING COMMITMENTS AND THE LACK OF </p><p>NATIONAL INSURANCE -- FROM CRISIS-AFFECTED BENEFICIARIES TO </p><p>WFP AND ITS DONORS.  A FAMINE RISK INSURANCE SCHEME WOULD </p><p>INVOLVE UP-FRONT FUNDING, BY WFP, TO ITS COUNTRY OFFICES ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF A CALCULATION OF THE "NET PRESENT VALUE" OF AN </p><p>EMERGENCY PROJECT.  IF WFP NEEDED TO BORROW FUNDS TO </p><p>FACILITATE THIS, IT WOULD REQUEST THE WORLD BANK TO ISSUE </p><p>DISCOUNT NOTES, OR "HUNGER BONDS", WHICH WOULD BE </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY REPLENISHED THROUGH CASH AND IN-KIND </p><p>COMMITMENTS.  DONORS, INCLUDING THE G-8, COULD PROVIDE </p><p>OVERSIGHT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND ACT AS A RE-INSURER OF </p><p>WFP, PLEDGING TO STEP IN SHOULD WFP NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS </p><p>DEBT-SERVICING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD PERMIT WFP TO </p><p>BORROW AT THE SAME ADVANTAGEOUS RATES AS THE WORLD BANK. </p><p> </p><p>II.  STEPS TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HUNGER AND FOOD AID </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>(E) STRENGTHEN ANALYSIS OF VULNERABILITY AND FOOD INSECURITY </p><p> </p><p>MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HELP NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, WFP </p><p>AND DONORS PINPOINT THE PEOPLE MOST VULNERABLE TO HUNGER AND </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER FOOD AID IS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO </p><p>THEIR NEEDS.  AN INVESTMENT OF USD 5 MILLION COULD HELP </p><p>EXPAND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS AND MAPPING (VAM) TO 13 </p><p>ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE UPDATING VAM WORK ALREADY DONE IN SEVEN COUNTRIES </p><p>    AND BUILDING VAM CAPACITY WITHIN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, </p><p>ENHANCING THEIR EFFORTS TO CONDUCT FOOD SECURITY </p><p>ASSESSMENTS, ANALYSIS AND PLANNING.  WFP\'S VAM UNITS WORK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH FAO\'S GLOBAL INFORMATION EARLY WARNING SYSTEM </p><p>AND USAID\'S FAMINE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM NETWORK AND DRAW ON </p><p>A RANGE OF INFORMATION FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY OF RAINFALL </p><p>AND CROP CONDITIONS TO COMMUNITY-LEVEL MONITORING OF MARKET </p><p>FOOD PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>(F) IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS </p><p> </p><p>WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD DEVELOP A BROADER ANALYTICAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES THE RANGE OF HAZARDS (DROUGHT, </p><p>FLOOD, CONFLICT, HIV/AIDS PREVALENCE, ETC.) THAT CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO FAMINE AND IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK AREAS.  IN ADDITION, THEY </p><p>WOULD BUILD NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY TO </p><p>TRACK THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT HAZARDS OVER TIME. </p><p> </p><p>(G) SUPPORT RELIABLE AND TIMELY EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001958  004 OF 005 </p><p> </p><p>GET FOOD AND OTHER </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS.  AN ESTIMATED USD 3 MILLION </p><p>WOULD HELP TO STRENGTHEN EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES, </p><p>PROVIDE TRAINING FOR NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>BODIES AND ESTABLISH A SYSTEM TO COMPARE NEEDS WITHIN SUB- </p><p>SAHARAN AFRICA.  OVER TWO YEARS, THIS PROCESS WOULD SEEK TO </p><p>BUILD CONSENSUS AMONG INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL </p><p>BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND, ON </p><p>THAT BASIS, REVISE EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES TO </p><p>BETTER INTEGRATE MICRO (HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY), MACRO </p><p>(NATIONAL FOOD GAP AND MARKET), LIVELIHOOD AND NUTRITION </p><p>ANALYSIS.  IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT </p><p>TRACKS AND COMPARES EMERGENCY FOOD AID NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>III.  MEASURES TO ENHANCE EARLY EARNING AND PREPAREDNESS IN </p><p>AFRICA </p><p></p><p>(H) EARLY WARNING AND PREPAREDNESS ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS FOR </p><p>QUICK AND TARGETED RESPONSES. KEY PARTNERS IN EARLY WARNING </p><p>AND PREPAREDNESS INCLUDE AFRICAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS, WFP, FAO, USAID\'S FAMINE EARLY </p><p>WARNING SYSTEM NETWORK (FEWSNET) AND SPECIALIZED </p><p>INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE </p><p>FOR CLIMATE PREDICTION, THE UN WORLD METEOROLOGICAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT OF USD 7.5 </p><p>MILLION OVER A 3-YEAR PERIOD, WITH ANNUAL RUNNING COSTS OF </p><p>USD 1 MILLION, WOULD PERMIT WFP AND ITS PARTNERS TO IMPROVE </p><p>AFRICAN EARLY WARNING AND PREPAREDNESS SYSTEMS, AND ENSURE </p><p>LINKAGES AMONG THESE SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>(I) REVIEW EXISTING EARLY WARNING AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS </p><p> </p><p>WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD REVIEW AND ASSESS EXISTING NATIONAL </p><p>AND REGIONAL RESOURCES, CAPACITIES AND PRACTICES IN EARLY </p><p>WARNING, PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE, WHICH VARY CONSIDERABLE </p><p>WITHIN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE MAPPING </p><p>RESOURCES AND CAPACITIES, COLLECTING BEST PRACTICES, AND </p><p>DEVELOPING COMMON OPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.  IT </p><p>WOULD ALSO INCLUDE REVIEWING NATIONAL STRATEGIC GRAIN </p><p>RESERVES AND THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR THEIR USE AND </p><p>REPLENISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>(J) STRENGTHEN EARLY WARNING, PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE </p><p>NETWORKS </p><p> </p><p>WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD WORK WITH NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>    REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNET-BASED SYSTEM </p><p>THAT BRINGS TOGETHER UP-TO-DATE FORECASTING OF DROUGHTS, </p><p>CYCLONES AND OTHER HAZARDS FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS </p><p>WOULD INCLUDE ESTABLISHING COMMON HAZARD ALERT LEVELS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THEY WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENHANCE </p><p>AFRICAN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CAPACITIES IN EMERGENCY </p><p>PREPAREDNESS, CONTINGENCY AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND BUILD </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN AFRICA TO PROMOTE SHARING OF </p><p>INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE AMONG COUNTRIES </p><p>BEFORE AND DURING FOOD CRISES. </p><p> </p><p>IV.  INVESTMENTS IN NUTRITION AND PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION </p><p> </p><p>(K) ESTABLISH NUTRITIONAL MONITORING </p><p> </p><p>MORE EFFECTIVE NUTRITIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS FOR SUB- </p><p>SAHARA AFRICA COULD PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION IN "NORMAL" </p><p>YEARS\' AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS.  AN INVESTMENT OF USD 11.4 </p><p>MILLION, WITH ANNUAL RUNNING COSTS OF USD 1.9 MILLION, WOULD </p><p>ALLOW WFP TO WORK WITH NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001958  005 OF 005 </p><p> </p><p>ICA.  REPUTABLE </p><p>NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS/UNIVERSITIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA </p><p>COULD BE POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS, WHICH WOULD HELP ENSURE </p><p>SUSTAINABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>(L) IMPROVE AND EXTEND NATIONAL CAPACITIES IN NUTRITION </p><p>INTERVENTION </p><p> </p><p>WFP WOULD SEEK TO PROVIDE TRAINING IN EMERGENCY NUTRITION </p><p>ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE FOR NATIONAL COUNTERPARTS IN 38 </p><p>COUNTRIES OVER FIVE YEARS.  AN ESTIMATED USD 2 MILLION WOULD </p><p>BE REQUIRED FOR THIS EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>(M) FORTIFY FOOD WITH MICRONUTRIENTS </p><p> </p><p>BUILDING AFRICAN CAPACITY TO FORTIFY FOOD WITH IMPORTANT </p><p>MICRONUTRIENTS WOULD HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON HEALTH, </p><p>    PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND MORTALITY RATES IN THE REGION. </p><p>THESE EFFORTS, WHICH WOULD COST AN ESTIMATED USD 6.8 </p><p>MILLION, WOULD INCLUDE WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO INVENTORY </p><p>MILLING AND FORTIFICATION CAPACITY BY COUNTRY; BUILD </p><p>ALLIANCES TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FORTIFICATION </p><p>ACTIVITIES; ESTABLISH SMALL-SCALE MILLS TO ADDRESS </p><p>MICRONUTRIENT NEEDS IN REMOTE AREAS; AND CREATE AND PILOT </p><p>MOBILE MILLS FOR USE IN SUDDEN ONSET AND REFUGEE </p><p>EMERGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>(N) GET CHILDREN TO SCHOOL </p><p> </p><p>THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF AFRICA WILL DEPEND GREATLY ON A WELL </p><p>NOURISHED, EDUCATED AND SKILLED WORKFORCE.  WFP WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NEPAD TO GET ALL PRIMARY SCHOOL- </p><p>AGED AFRICAN CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL THROUGH SUPPORT FOR </p><p>SCHOOL FEEDING ACTIVITIES.  AN INITIAL ANNUAL INVESTMENT OF </p><p>USD 300 MILLION, TO BE GRADUALLY INCREASED TO USD 2 BILLION </p><p>ANNUALLY BY 2015, WOULD PERMIT WFP TO SUPPORT THE EDUCATION </p><p>FOR ALL INITIATIVE BY EXPANDING SCHOOL FEEDING TO REACH MOST </p><p>OF THE 40-50 MILLION OUT-OF SCHOOL CHILDREN TO BENEFIT FROM </p><p>PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION.  BY WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO </p><p>PROVIDE DEWORMING AND MOSQUITO NETS TO EACH CHILD AND </p><p>ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS HAVE CLEAN WATER AND HIV/AIDS </p><p>AWARENESS PROGRAMS, WFP WOULD ALSO PROMOTE CHILD HEALTH AND </p><p>ENSURE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FULLY FROM THE </p><p>NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THEIR FOOD." </p><p>END TEXT OF WFP PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>    ------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) IN US MISSION\'S VIEW, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF "QUICK </p><p>WINS" IN THESE WFP PROPOSALS, I.E., THE ABILITY TO MAKE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH MODEST INVESTMENTS. WITH SOME 38- </p><p>40 MILLION AFRICANS IN 2003 LIVING WITH THE THREAT OF </p><p>STARVATION AND ANOTHER 156 MILLION WHO SUFFER QUIETLY THIS </p><p>YEAR FROM CHRONIC HUNGER, THE EVIAN G8 SUMMIT PRESENTS A </p><p>UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CEMENT A BROADER POLITICAL COMMITMENT </p><p>ON THE ISSUE OF AFRICAN HUNGER.
