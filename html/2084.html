<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002687 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SU, CG, XA, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED EAGER ABOUT SUDAN, PERPLEXED </p><p>BY DROC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2562 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: During an October 16 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, NSA Aliyu Mohammed stated that Nigeria, actively </p><p>engaged on Sudan, would host a "3-in-1" conference ultimately </p><p>bringing together the Southern factions, Northern opposition </p><p>and Bashir Government negotiators around one conference </p><p>table.  Mentioning the USG would be invited to observe the </p><p>November 12-17 meetings, Mohammed suggested Special Envoy </p><p>Danforth visit Nigeria before going to Sudan.  While animated </p><p>about Sudan, the NSA merely shook his head about DROC, </p><p>describing it as a thicket of internal and regional intrigue </p><p>from which Nigeria might disengage unless the parties </p><p>demonstrated more seriousness in their negotiations.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Visibly pleased with his country\'s efforts, Mohammed </p><p>declared that Nigeria had progressed far on the Sudan.  Dr. </p><p>S.G. Bugaje, the President\'s Special Envoy on Sudan, had just </p><p>returned from talks in Cairo and London with various </p><p>opposition groups, Mohammed informed us, calling this the </p><p>last leg in Nigeria\'s plan to consult the various Sudan </p><p>players.  Now, he asserted, Nigeria had the green light to </p><p>convene the "3-in-1" conference.  The format would be an </p><p>initial  meeting of Southern factions, then a second meeting </p><p>of the National Democratic Alliance would ensue.  Afterwards, </p><p>the opposition (North and South) would meet Government </p><p>negotiators in the third conference.  (Comment.  Apparently, </p><p>the Nigerians have refined their thinking about the </p><p>composition of the second meeting.  In reftel, Mohammed said </p><p>the second stage would be for the Northern opposition.  This </p><p>time he stated it would be for the entire opposition.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The NSA continued that President Obasanjo had drafted </p><p>a letter to President Bush asking for an official USG </p><p>observer presence at the talks.  Mohammed added that IGAD </p><p>states, Egypt and Libya would receive similar letters. </p><p>Former President Carter, having expressed interest in Sudan </p><p>to his old friend Obasanjo, might also attend the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ambassador Jeter, joined by PolCouns, asked Mohammed </p><p>if he could visit London October 24 for more detailed </p><p>consultations with the DAS Snyder/Bob Oakley team traveling </p><p>to East Africa for preliminary discussions that will pave the </p><p>way for Senator Danforth\'s November trip to Sudan.  Grappling </p><p>momentarily with his schedule, Mohammed offered that Dr. </p><p>Bugaje would fly to London if he, Mohammed, could not break </p><p>free.  The NSA then suggested that, once ready to visit </p><p>Africa, Special Envoy Danforth should consult in Abuja with </p><p>President Obasanjo prior to setting down in Khartoum.   After </p><p>raising two possible time frames for a Danforth visit to </p><p>Abuja, November 11-12 (before Sudan) or November 17-18 (after </p><p>Sudan) Jeter and Mohammed decided a third alternative was </p><p>worth exploring - a November - 2 or 3 meeting in Washington </p><p>during President Obasanjo\'s working visit.  (During a brief </p><p>October 18 meeting, President Obasanjo invited Dansforth to </p><p>come November 17-18 after being informed by Ambassador Jeter </p><p>that Danforth would not be in Washington November 2.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>A HARD DROC </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  As discussion moved to DROC, Mohammed\'s face dimmed. </p><p>Opposition leaders Bemba and Onusumba, meeting President </p><p>Obasanjo last Friday, forecasted the Addis talks would yield </p><p>nothing significant.  With 300 participants, the Addis forum </p><p>was too unwieldy for the intricate, detailed discussions </p><p>needed for a break-through, the opposition duo grumbled.  A </p><p>senior Libya official Mohammed met in Paris provided the same </p><p>gloomy forecast that now seemed unfortunately accurate, </p><p>Mohammed said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The NSA commented that in Brussels, the Belgians were </p><p>also pessimistic.  The Belgian Director of Military </p><p>Intelligence told Mohammed that Nigeria\'s </p><p>reconciliation/power-sharing ideas would not work, in part, </p><p>because the opposition and the Kinshasa government had both </p><p>overestimated their strengths.  Bemba and Onusumba boast they </p><p>control 60 percent of the land between them while Kabila </p><p>trumpets that 70 percent of the population live under his </p><p>control.  Each thinks he holds the trump card.  While Kagame </p><p>and Museveni continue to suborn Bemba and Onusumba, Dos </p><p>Santos and Mugabe lend their support to Kinshasa.  Mohammed </p><p>postulated that too many of DROC\'s neighbors derived </p><p>geo-political and economic benefit from the country remaining </p><p>the sick man of central Africa.  Some neighbors were wary of </p><p>seeing a united DROC that might dwarf them.  More troubling, </p><p>Kabila\'s once encouraging pace towards reform and </p><p>reconciliation had assumed a slower gait and might be in </p><p>danger of changing direction altogether, Mohammed lamented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Mohammed confided that Nigeria had found the DROC </p><p>peace process more multi-layered and complicated than </p><p>expected.  Unless the parties started to negotiate seriously, </p><p>Nigeria might disengage altogether. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WADE\'S TERRORISM CONFERENCE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The NSA mentioned Obasanjo was in Dakar for President </p><p>Wade\'s anti-terrorism conference.  Mohammed characterized </p><p>Wade\'s conference as a good idea undermined by poor </p><p>implementation.  Obasanjo went to Dakar to correct Wade\'s </p><p>procedural gaffes.  Explaining further, Mohammed stated that </p><p>Wade erred by calling a Heads-of-State meeting first.  The </p><p>correct sequence should have been an experts\' session, </p><p>followed by a Ministerial, culminating in a Presidential </p><p>summit.  Second, Wade stumbled into a minor firestorm by </p><p>inviting Morocco to a conference, which should have been </p><p>convoked under the aegis of the Africa Union (AU).  Morocco </p><p>was not an AU member and those African states that support </p><p>Polisario say they would likely boycott the Wade session </p><p>because of the Moroccan invitation, Mohammed claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>DOMESTIC UNREST - A TALE OF CITIES - JOS/KANO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Turning to matters closer to home, Mohammed stated </p><p>that he had just met a group of concerned citizens from Jos. </p><p>The group contended that the board of inquiry constituted to </p><p>investigate the recent violence in Jos was ethnically-biased. </p><p> After a long discussion, he believed the concerns of the </p><p>delegation were assuaged and that these prominent citizens </p><p>would now help, rather than hinder, the board\'s deliberation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Dismissing the violence in Kano as the work of </p><p>street youth and quasi-gangs, Mohammed breathed a sigh of </p><p>comparative relief, saying Kano was not nearly one-tenth as </p><p>bad as Jos.  He estimated that less than 100 people were </p><p>killed in Kano, but admitted the GON estimate of 20 deaths </p><p>was an understatement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  NSA Mohammed appeared optimistic that Nigeria will </p><p>be able to push the Sudanese process along.  We hope so. </p><p>However, he is quickly becoming disillusioned with the </p><p>process in the DROC.  Now that it has become time to talk in </p><p>earnest about the substantive issues leading to peace, the </p><p>Congolese parties seem to be steering towards their </p><p>recalcitrant worst.  We suspect that Mohammed may get a </p><p>similar jolt from the Sudanese in the near future.  Right </p><p>now, progress may seem relatively easy as the Sudanese </p><p>parties probably see Abuja as another opportunity to forum </p><p>shop and while talks are basically focused on procedural </p><p>matters.  However, when the thorny substantial issues hit the </p><p>table, Mohammed will likely find the Sudanese every bit as </p><p>stubborn as the contenders in the Congo. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
