<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:2/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, AINF, IZ, NI, MY, UNSC, NAM </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: RESPONSE TO NAM STATEMENT DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p>Refs: State 47493 </p><p>-     Kuala Lumpur 944 </p><p>-     Abuja 344 (NOTAL) </p><p>-     Abuja 353 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) DCM February 22 delivered ref A points to MFA </p><p>Permanent Secretary Ambassador T.D. Hart.  Hart took the USG </p><p>position on board, promising to convey it to FM Sule Lamido. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: Nigeria believes that Iraq must be disarmed </p><p>through the UN Security Council but that Saddam must realize </p><p>that the USG will not stand down its forces without a strong </p><p>justification.  Detail on Nigeria\'s position is contained in </p><p>refs C&D.  Hart echoed ref A points as DCM made them, but it </p><p>was not clear whether he did so out of personal or official </p><p>agreement or was simply reiterating to make sure he grasped </p><p>them fully. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: President Obasanjo makes his own </p><p>decisions on foreign policy issues and was already in Kuala </p><p>Lumpur by Saturday morning, Nigeria time.  The President\'s </p><p>International Affairs Advisor, Ad\'Obe Obe, accompanied his </p><p>boss to Singapore and Malaysia.  Obe is clear-headed, knows </p><p>Nigeria\'s national interests and can influence Obasanjo on </p><p>foreign policy issues.  He has been accessible to us in Abuja. </p><p>Lamido, on the other hand, often succumbs to the allure of </p><p>stand-up-to-the-West NAM "solidarity" and may be harder for </p><p>the USG to engage effectively.  Hart noted, however, that it </p><p>was Lamido (in Kuala Lumpur since Friday) who was involved in </p><p>the "nitty-gritty" of drafting the statement.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Note: Abuja does not seem to be a member of the NAM </p><p>Collective.  We will request inclusion septel.  The Department </p><p>is requested to insert Abuja as a separate addressee until </p><p>such time as the collective can be updated. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
