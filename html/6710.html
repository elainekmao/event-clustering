(U) Over the weekend, Reuters, citing UN and ICRC </p><p>sources, reported that up to 500,000 persons have been </p><p>displaced in northern Iraq.  UN representatives in Ankara </p><p>provided lower estimates of displacement.  Thus far, there </p><p>has been no significant movement of DPs to the Turkish </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Andre LaPerriere, UNICEF\'s Northern Iraq Field </p><p>Representative, summarizing information provided by UN OPS </p><p>and UNICEF, provided an estimate of 280,000 persons </p><p>displaced within northern Iraq.  There is DP movement from </p><p>9 cities to 14 others in the region, with large movements </p><p>to and from Sulaymaniyah.  LaPerriere said the majority of </p><p>these DPs had found shelter.  There has also been a </p><p>significant number of DPs returning to their homes when </p><p>they perceive the situation to be stable.  He stated that </p><p>there has been movement from central Iraq (including Mosul </p><p>and Kirkuk), but had no estimate of the number of these </p><p>DPs.  UNHCR\'s Deputy Turkey Representative Steven Corliss </p><p>and Claire Van der Vaeren, UNDP Deputy Representative, </p><p>confirmed the information given by LaPerriere.  They also </p><p>said that there was no movement toward the Turkish border. </p><p>Van der Vaeren noted fuel shortages in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ICRC Representative Finn Ruda confirmed that </p><p>Sulaymaniyah had seen relatively large DP movements, but </p><p>also an "accordion"-like movement of persons away from and </p><p>back to their homes as their perceived security changes. </p><p>ICRC believes there are well under 500,000 DPs in all of </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A Mercy Corps International representative in </p><p>Sulaymaniyah told us that the pattern of displaced persons </p><p>returning to their homes is not taking place in Dahuk. </p><p>This may be due to the town\'s proximity to Mosul. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
