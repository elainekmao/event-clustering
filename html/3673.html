<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD "UNCLES" APPRECIATE CONTINUED U.S. SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 1147 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 1060 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 1018 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  National League for Democracy Central Executive </p><p>Committee members ("the uncles") told Chief of Mission on </p><p>September 9 that they appreciate continued U.S. support for </p><p>their party and encourage increased pressure on the regime </p><p>for democratic change.  COM Martinez agreed with the uncles </p><p>that the regime may be backing away from political </p><p>reconciliation at this time, but also noted that it was </p><p>illogical to do so with the EU troika in Rangoon and the UN </p><p>General Assembly about to convene.  She assured them of </p><p>continued U.S. pressure for democratic reform but cautioned </p><p>that the threat of a trade ban would be more effective than </p><p>actually imposing the ban.  The uncles also mentioned that </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi has not met with Secretary One - Lt. General </p><p>Khin Nyunt or Senior General Than Shwe since her release from </p><p>house detention on May 6.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Uncles Thank U.S. For Continued Support; Request More Pressure </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  At an introductory meeting with Chief of Mission </p><p>Carmen Martinez on September 9, NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe, </p><p>Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, Secretary U Lwin, and Central </p><p>Executive Committee member U Nyunt Wei (the uncles) said they </p><p>appreciated continued U.S. support for their efforts to move </p><p>the regime toward democratic reform.  For instance, they </p><p>said, they were "very pleased, very happy" that the U.S. had </p><p>expressed concern over the recent arrest and sentencing of </p><p>two NLD members for possessing a banned publication. (Note: </p><p>They said they heard this on a short-wave radio broadcast. </p><p>End Note.)  COM Martinez asked how the uncles interpreted the </p><p>regime\'s latest series of actions.  She noted that the regime </p><p>has had several opportunities recently to do simple things - </p><p>releasing political prisoners, investigating Shan rape cases, </p><p>not arresting NLD members and students protesters - that </p><p>would have helped mute international criticism.  Instead the </p><p>regime appears to have decided to assert control just as the </p><p>EU troika is in Rangoon, the UN resolution on Burma is being </p><p>formulated, and the UN General Assembly is about to convene. </p><p>Chairman U Aung Shwe summed up his assessment of the regime\'s </p><p>backward shift by saying "they just don\'t want to talk to </p><p>us." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The uncles said the only way the regime would </p><p>continue moving forward on reforms would be in response to </p><p>continued pressure from the U.S. and others.  They said that </p><p>the recent lack of action by the regime after the relatively </p><p>positive atmosphere during the Razali visit was an indication </p><p>that the "carrots" some in the international community have </p><p>been using to encourage reform do not have the desired </p><p>effect.  The regime will accept the carrots but allow change </p><p>"on their own schedule," which is far too slow.  CEC member U </p><p>Nyunt Wei asked if the U.S. was still considering a trade ban </p><p>on Burma, noting that this might bring about change.  Asked </p><p>if it would not also hurt the poor by decreasing employment, </p><p>he said it would hit the business people closest to the </p><p>regime most and they would, in turn, put pressure for reform </p><p>on the generals.  COM Martinez said she would pass this view </p><p>on, but noted that the threat of a trade ban would probably </p><p>be more effective pressure than implementing the ban.  She </p><p>reasoned that the economic effects of the ban would be </p><p>minimal and the generals would use the ban as an excuse for </p><p>their poor state of the economy (Note: As they currently do </p><p>with the investment ban.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p>Party Offices, Newspaper, Legal Actions for Prisoners </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Secretary U Lwin said the NLD is ready to open NLD </p><p>offices nationwide, except for Kayah State, whenever it gets </p><p>agreement with the SPDC.  There are no NLD leaders available </p><p>to staff an office in Kayin State; the State Chairman was </p><p>recently released from prison but he is old and bedridden due </p><p>to a stroke.  Regarding the publication of an NLD newspaper, </p><p>the uncles said the NLD has applied to the Ministry of Home </p><p>Affairs for permission to publish the paper but, "like so </p><p>many things," it is "under consideration at higher levels." </p><p>Regarding the release last week of eight political prisoners, </p><p>the uncles said that most of those released had served most </p><p>of their sentences when they were released.  One, they noted, </p><p>was not an NLD member but a 70-year-old woman arrested in </p><p>1996 or 1997 for operating a copier machine to duplicate </p><p>political materials.  Only two of those released were NLD </p><p>members; others were only supporters of the party. </p><p>5. (C)  Vice Chairman U Tin Oo said the NLD would attempt to </p><p>provide legal assistance to the two students arrested for a </p><p>political protest at city hall on August 18 (refs a and b). </p><p>The NLD is working with a local lawyer, U Kyi Win, to find </p><p>out when and where the students\' trial will be held and to </p><p>provide them legal counsel.  The NLD has been in touch with </p><p>the families of the two students but, so far, the government </p><p>has not notified the families of the trial date.  U Tin Oo </p><p>said the NLD\'s strategy is to force the trial into the public </p><p>realm so the process is at least somewhat transparent. </p><p>Otherwise, he noted, the sentence will just be announced and </p><p>the two will go to prison with no due process. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Adding to the mystery of whether ASSK has met with </p><p>senior level officials since her release on May 6, the uncles </p><p>stated, contrary to what ASSK herself indicated (see ref c, </p><p>para. 4), that she has not met with Secretary One Lt. General </p><p>Khin Nyunt or Senior General Than Shwe. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The uncles\' call for increased international pressure </p><p>is a familiar refrain, but questions remain as to how </p><p>involved they actually are in the negotiations with the SPDC. </p><p> Aung San Suu Kyi has held these negotiations very close to </p><p>her chest and even her closest advisors may have little idea </p><p>of what progress is or is not being made. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
