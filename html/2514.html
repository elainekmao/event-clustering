<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000411 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: TEN TIBETAN REFUGEES\' ASYLUM REQUEST PASSED OVER </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 1768 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael S. Hoza; Reasons 1.5 (B),(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Nepal\'s Home Ministry declined to include the names of </p><p>ten Tibetan refugees held on immigration violations in a </p><p>letter to the King recommending candidates for a royal </p><p>amnesty.  Traditionally the King grants amnesty to prisoners </p><p>on auspicious occasions, including the February 19 Democracy </p><p>Day.  As a constitutional monarch, the King acts on </p><p>recommendations for amnesty presented by the Home Ministry. </p><p>The King himself can neither add nor delete names, and merely </p><p>rubber-stamps the list, sources close to the Palace told us. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) All ten refugees had initially crossed into Nepal from </p><p>Tibet, had been interviewed by UNHCR in Kathmandu, and had </p><p>been transported to India under the supervision of UNHCR and </p><p>Nepalese immigration officials.  Eight of the ten were </p><p>arrested at a check point after re-entering Nepal from India </p><p>for the purpose of returning to Tibet and were charged with </p><p>the lack of legal travel documents (Reftel).  With the </p><p>assistance of the Dalai Lama\'s Representative to Nepal, </p><p>lawyers for the ten Tibetans prepared petitions to the Home </p><p>Ministry requesting amnesty.  (Note:  Some press accounts </p><p>give the number of jailed Tibetans seeking amnesty as eleven. </p><p> An eleventh individual, a woman, was originally part of a </p><p>group of nine (eight of the ten) caught by Nepali authorities </p><p>in late August.  Suffering from psychological trauma, she was </p><p>immediately hospitalized and as a result was never formally </p><p>charged with a crime.  She continues to receive medical </p><p>attention in Nepal under the watchful eye of UNHCR.  End </p><p>Note.)  However, the ten names were not included on the Home </p><p>Ministry\'s list of candidates for the Febuary amnesty. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Poloff contacted Home Ministry officials repeatedly to </p><p>ask that the Tibetans\' request be considered, Acting DCM </p><p>discussed the case with a Home Ministry Joint Secretary, and </p><p>Ambassador Malinowski sent a letter to the Home Minister </p><p>February 15 urging him to consider including the names on the </p><p>list of candidates for amnesty as a way to reaffirm Nepal\'s </p><p>commitment to human rights and the protection of refugees. </p><p>The Embassy and UNHCR also informed the Home Ministry, </p><p>repeatedly, that these were individuals of concern to UNHCR. </p><p>Post will continue to raise the issue of the ten individuals\' </p><p>detention.  The King will next grant an amnesty on the </p><p>occasion of his birthday in July. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
