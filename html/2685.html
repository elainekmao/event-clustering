<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, AORC, IT, UNHRC-1, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: 58TH UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS: ITALIAN VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 49534 </p><p>     B. STATE 55718 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IN THE ABSENCE OF OFFICE HEAD COUNSELOR EMANUELE </p><p>PIGNATELLI IN GENEVA, POLOFF DISCUSSED REF A DEMARCHE POINTS </p><p>3/19 WITH MFA OFFICE OF HUMAN RIGHTS COUNSELOR ALBERTO </p><p>CECCARELLI.  ON SAME DAY (3/26) AMBASSADOR MET WITH MFA </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL GIUSEPPE BALDOCCI (SEPTEL), POLOFF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01556  271556Z </p><p>DELIVERED A DUPLICATE SET OF REF B TALKING POINTS TO </p><p>CECCARELLI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CECCARELLI COMMENTED ON REF A POINTS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- CUBA: ITALY FAVORS HAVING A RESOLUTION PRESENTED. </p><p>CECCARELLI REFERRED TO EU VIEW THAT RESOLUTION SHOULD INCLUDE </p><p>REFERENCE TO CUBA\'S "ECONOMIC SITUATION" (I.E., HE DID </p><p>NOT/NOT USE THE WORD "EMBARGO" -- A WORD ABSENCE WE ATTRIBUTE </p><p>TO DIPLOMATIC DELICACY, NOT A CHANGE IN POLICY). </p><p> </p><p>-- MIDDLE EAST: CECCARELLI AGREED RESOLUTIONS SHOULD BE </p><p>BALANCED.  (DURING THEIR 3/26 MEETING, MFA SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>BALDOCCI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE WOULD REVIEW OUR TALKING </p><p>POINTS AND GET BACK TO US.  WE SUGGESTED ITALY MIGHT WISH TO </p><p>RECONSIDER ITS TRADITIONAL POLICY OF GOING ALONG WITH THE EU </p><p>CONSENSUS, WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE, AND TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS </p><p>OCCASION TO CALL FOR A VOTE ON ONE OR MORE OF THE UNBALANCED </p><p>RESOLUTIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- SUDAN: ONE OF THE "GRAVEST SITUATIONS," ACCORDING TO </p><p>CECCARELLI.  NONETHELESS, HE SAID, THE KEY TO PROGRESS LIES </p><p>IN OPENING A DIALOGUE DOOR WITH THE SUDANESE. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ: CECCARELLI OBSERVED WE ARE PASSING FROM A SITUATION </p><p>OF POTENTIAL PERIL TO REAL PERIL. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAN: CECCARELLI RETURNED AGAIN TO THEME "DIALOGUE."  THE </p><p>EU IS FOLLOWING A DOUBLE TRACK, HE SAID, CRITICIZING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, TRYING TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE AND FAVOR POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01556  271556Z </p><p> </p><p>-- PARTS OF SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE: EU MEMBERS HAVE NOT YET </p><p>SEEN A RESOLUTION DRAFT TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>-- AFGHANISTAN: THE GOI, HE SAID, IS KEEPING THE SITUATION IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN UNDER REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>-- CHECHNYA: THE EU IS EXAMINING ELEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION AND </p><p>A POSSIBLE EVENTUAL CHAIRMAN\'S STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- ZIMBABWE: THIS YEAR\'S "BLACK SHEEP;" THE DEVELOPING </p><p>SITUATION LEAVES THE GOI MUCH DISTRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>-- ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS: CECCARELLI REFERRED </p><p>TO U.S./EU DIFFERENCES BUT DISMISSED THEM AS "NO BIG DEAL." </p><p> </p><p>-- DEATH PENALTY: ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS A POINT OF </p><p>"COMPLETE ACCORD" IN THE EU (I.E., AND THEREFORE OF COMPLETE </p><p>DISACCORD WITH THE U.S.). </p><p> </p><p>-- OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE TORTURE CONVENTION: CECCARELLI </p><p>OBSERVED THAT ITALY EXPECTS TO ADOPT A LAW ON TORTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: RESPONDING TO POLOFF\'S QUESTION, CECCARELLI </p><p>SAID HE HAS SEEN NO OBVIOUS CHANGES IN GOI APPROACHES TO </p><p>UNCHR ISSUES.  THE CENTER-RIGHT BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT, HE </p><p>SAID, IS PURSUING THE SAME OBJECTIVES, AND EMPLOYING THE SAME </p><p>TACTICS, AS ITS CENTER-LEFT PREDECESSORS.  NONETHELESS, WE </p><p>BELIEVE SOME ROOM EXISTS FOR ENCOURAGING NEW GOI THINKING. </p><p>THE GOI UNDER BERLUSCONI RETAINS A EUROPEAN OUTLOOK, BUT WITH </p><p>A DIFFERENCE.  IT CONSIDERS THE ASSERTION OF NATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01556  271556Z </p><p>INTERESTS WITHIN EU FORUMS AS LEGITIMATE FOR ITALY AS IT IS, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, FOR GERMANY AND FRANCE.  AT LEAST FOR NOW, </p><p>BERLUSCONI HIMSELF HEADS NOT ONLY THE GOI BUT ALSO THE MFA. </p><p>DIRECT AND EARLY/EARLY U.S. APPROACHES TO BERLUSCONI, BEFORE </p><p>THE "EU CONSENSUS" SETTLES INTO CONCRETE, COULD ENERGIZE THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF ITALIAN VIEWS IN BRUSSELS AND PRODUCE, FOR </p><p>THE USG, EU POLICY DIVIDENDS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01556 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
