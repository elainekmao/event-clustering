KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PREF, PHUM, TU, IZ, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: MULTIPARTY TALKS (V) - TURKS </p><p>UNWILLING TO DISCUSS MILITARY PLANS W/IRAQI KURDS, PREPARED </p><p>TO DISCUSS POLITICAL FUTURE OF IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. LEMPERT-PEARSON E-MAIL OF 2/1/03 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 800 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 629 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     D. STATE 18029 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) DCM met MFA DG for Middle East Tahsin Burcuoglu </p><p>February 3 to discuss the upcoming multi-party talks per Ref </p><p>A.  Burcuoglu said the Turks would set up separate bilats for </p><p>Amb. Khalilzad and his delegation at MFA and at TGS on </p><p>February 5.  For the multi-party talks on Feb. 6, Burcuoglu </p><p>said, "we are not ready to have multi-party talks without the </p><p>Iraqi Turkmen Front.  A US-Turkey-KDP/PUK meeting is not </p><p>acceptable to us.  We are not prepared to discuss a Turkish </p><p>military presence in northern Iraq with the Kurds.  On </p><p>numbers of troops and other details, they will be </p><p>notified...that\'s all.  We will never discuss Turkish </p><p>military presence issues with those guys or ask for their </p><p>permission.  Discussing the political fate and future of Iraq </p><p>and northern Iraq is another issue and we are prepared for </p><p>those talks with the Kurds and the ITF." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) DCM pushed back using Ref A points but Burcuoglu </p><p>wouldn\'t budge.  He told us his instruction from U/S Ziyal </p><p>was to ask if the US was requesting talks without the ITF to </p><p>appease Barzani.  He then tried to argue that the ITF was the </p><p>sole legitimate representative of the Iraqi Turkmen - a </p><p>principled position which Turkey would not change - but that </p><p>the KDP and the PUK were not the only reps of the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds.  DCM noted that being unable to have the </p><p>US-Turkey-KDP/PUK talks would prevent us from dealing with </p><p>issues that needed to be addressed.  Burcuoglu said the MFA </p><p>position was clear - talks must include the ITF and the Turks </p><p>would not discuss military planning with the Kurds.  Turkey </p><p>was ready for US-Turkey-KDP/PUK-ITF talks on the 6th on the </p><p>future of Iraq and northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Burcuoglu also expressed Turkish security concerns </p><p>about holding the Iraqi opposition conference in northern </p><p>Iraq if the date slips beyond mid-February.  He referred to </p><p>rumors that US air strikes would begin by Feb. 18 and a </p><p>ground assault by Feb. 28, and wondered how the conference </p><p>could go forward with such possibilities hanging over its </p><p>head.  He added that Turkey was increasingly concerned about </p><p>Iranian involvement with the opposition, and suggested that </p><p>INC leader Ahmed Chalabi might declare a provisional </p><p>government from Iran.  We urged Burcuoglu to raise all of </p><p>Turkey\'s concerns with Amb. Khalilzad on Feb. 5. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
