(C) SUMMARY: ON MARCH 26 CHARGE AND ECONOFF MET </p><p>WITH STEWART COMBERBACH, PERMANENT SECRETARY AT THE </p><p>MINNISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN AN </p><p>INFORMAL MEETING TO DISCUSS CURRENT EVENTS AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.   THE PERMSEC, WITH WHOM WE ENJOY FRANK </p><p>AND HONEST DIALOGUE TOUCHED, UNPROMPTED, ON A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF TIMELY AND NOTEWORTHY TOPICS.  THE MAIN </p><p>POINTS ARE: THAT ZIMBABWE RETAINS HOPE THAT IT WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE AFRICAN </p><p>GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA); THAT POLICY </p><p>AGREEMENT TO DEVALUE HAS OCCURRED THOUGH WHEN AND BY </p><p>HOW MUCH IS YET UNKNOWN; AND THAT THE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICANS WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND FRANK, THOUGH </p><p>IT IS PREMATURE TO WANT TO SEE CHANGES OR BENEFITS. </p><p>THE PERMSEC DID NOT HAVE HARD DATA ON A MEETING DATE </p><p>FOR THE MBEKI/MUGABE MEETING, AND WANTS TO MAINTAIN </p><p>AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.

BASED ON CONVERSATIONS </p><p>HELD LAST YEAR WITH FORMER DAS WHITNEY SCHNEIDMANN </p><p>AND USTR\'S ROSA WHITTAKER, COMBERBACH WAS UNDER THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT THERE EXISTS A CERTAIN LATITUDE IN </p><p>THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ACT\'S DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS HURDLES SET OUT IN THE ACT\'S LANGUAGE.  IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, IF ZIMBABWE CAN BE SEEN AS MAKING </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARDS IMPROVING ITS RULE OF LAW STANCE AND </p><p>RESPECT FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS, IS IT SUFFICIENT TO GET </p><p>THE TRADE BENEFITS OF THE ACT?  WE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>THIS WAS NOT AN INTERPRETATION WE WERE FAMILIAR WITH, </p><p>ALSO NOTING THAT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>OFFICIAL REACTIONS TO BOTH THE CMAG VISIT PROPOSAL </p><p>AND THE RECEPTION GIVEN THE INTERNATIONAL BAR </p><p>ASSOCIATION DELEGATION TENDED TO MOVE ZIMBABWE\'S CASE </p><p>FURTHER BACK, RATHER THAN AHEAD.  THE PERMSEC WANTS </p><p>TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE OPEN ON THE MATTER, WITH THE </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS HE KNOWS AND WITH THOSE REPRESENTING </p><p>THE NEW ADMINSTRATION.  AS THE EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON </p><p>HAD NO ONE CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE DIALOGUE, </p><p>COMBERBACH ASKED FOR CONTACT INFORMATION OF VARIOUS </p><p>AMERICAN OFFICIALS SO HE COULD DO IT HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>== TIED TO THE PRECEDING POINT, COMBERBACH EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT HE HAD COMMUNICATED ZIMBABWE\'S AGOA </p><p>REQUIREMENTS\' PROBLEM TO HIS COUNTERPART AT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01124  01 OF 02  270600Z </p><p>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS.  HE RELATED TO US, WITHOUT </p><p>MUCH ENTHUSIASM, THE RESPONSE HE RECEIVED, WHICH WAS </p><p>THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS BEING FIRMLY UPHELD </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME </p><p>"TRESPASSING" BY "FORMER LIBERATION FIGHTERS". </p><p>DISINGENEOUS AS THE REPONSE IS, COMBERBACH HAD </p><p>REPEATEDLY ASKED THE HOME AFFAIRS MINSTRY FOR A LIST </p><p>OF ALL THE INCIDENTS TO WHICH THE POLICE HAD TAKEN </p><p>APPROPRIATE ACTION SO THAT HE COULD FORWARD IT TO THE </p><p>USG FOR OUR GOOD CONSIDERATION, BUT TO DATE HAD </p><p>RECEIVED NO SUCH DATA. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MESS AND DEVALUING </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>== ON DEVALUATION, HE TOLD US THAT A POLICY DECISION </p><p>HAD BEEN MADE TO DEVALUE, THOUGH THE TIMING, AND THE </p><p>AMOUNT, OF THE SHIFT HAD NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, BUT </p><p>RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FLOATING EXCHANGE </p><p>RATE.  HE FURTHER TOLD US THAT IT WAS WITH THIS IN </p><p>MIND THAT THE FINANCE MINSTER MAKONI HAD MET RECENTLY </p><p>WITH SOME OF THE MAIN PLAYERS ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>SCENE.  THESE INCLUDED THE COMMERCIAL BANKS, BUREAUS </p><p>DE CHANGE AND SOME OF THE LEADING EXPORTERS (THESE IN </p><p>THE COMPANY OF MINSITER OF STATE FOR SECURITY, </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE), TO INFORM THEM THAT THIS TIME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO3424 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01124  02 OF 02  270558Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   INSE-00  IO-00    ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------D76E86  270558Z /22 </p><p>P 270540Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8511 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001124 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, BARAK HOFFMAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01124  02 OF 02  270558Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDUSTRY PERMSEC BRIEFS US ON A RANGE OF </p><p>ISSUES: AGOA; DEVALUATION; AND TALKS WITH SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>EVERYONE INVOLVED MUST STICK AND PLAY TOGETHER, AND </p><p>NOT ALLOW THE PARALLEL OR THE BLACK MARKET TO GET TOO </p><p>FAR AWAY FROM THE OFFICIAL RATE.  MAKONI\'S MESSAGE </p><p>WAS THAT "WE WILL NOT PLAY CHASE AFTER JOHNNY" IN </p><p>TERMS OF THE OPERATIVE EXCHANGE RATE, AS HAS BEEN THE </p><p>CASE OF LATE, SAID THE PERMSEC.  COMBERBACH FURTHER </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT MADE A DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN A PARALLEL AND A BLACK MARKET FOR FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCY.  THE FORMER, WHICH QUOTED A RATE SLIGHTLY </p><p>ABOVE THE OFFICIAL ONE, WAS TOLERABLE AS A PRESSURE </p><p>VALVE.  THE LATTER, WHERE FOREX STARVED PEOPLE PAID </p><p>AN EXCHANGE RATE FO UP TO (RECENTLY) 120 ZIMBABWE </p><p>DOLLARS TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, IS VIEWED BY SOME ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS AS ECONOMIC SABOTAGE, CARRIED OUT </p><p>BY PRE-LIBERATION MINDED INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN </p><p>PERSONAL GAIN OR DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY.  IF THIS TYPE </p><p>OF THINKING PREVAILS, HE TOLD US, THEN IT COULD GET </p><p>VERY MESSY WITH THE POLICE OR OTHERS BROUGHT IN TO </p><p>ENFORCE EXCHANGE REGULATIONS, ELIMINATE FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCY ACCOUNTS OR SEIZE ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICANS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>== ON THE SUBJECT OF THE RECENTLY HELD SOUTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01124  02 OF 02  270558Z </p><p>AFRICAN/ZIMBABWEAN MINISTERIAL MEETINGS, COMBERBACH </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO OFFER IN THE WAY </p><p>OF HARD FACTS OR PARTICULARS, BUT SAID THAT THE TALKS </p><p>WERE VERY FRANK.  HIS EXPLANATION FOR THE LACK OF </p><p>DATA WAS THAT HIS MINISTER, AND MINISTER MAKONI OF </p><p>FINANCE, HAD MORE THAN TWO HOURS OF TALKS WITH ONLY </p><p>MINISTER MANUEL OF SOUTH AFRICA, FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>PRIVATE DINNER OF THE THREE.  HE LAMENTED THE LACK OF </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMUNICATION REFERRING TO MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER AND HIS COUNTERPART, </p><p>AND THE ENERGY MINISTER AS WELL, NONE OF THE CONTENT </p><p>OF WHICH GOT SHARED AMONGST ALL THE GOZ PLAYERS. </p><p> </p><p>== COMBERBACH TOLD US THAT THE SOUTH AFRICANS WERE </p><p>VERY AWARE OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION </p><p>HERE, AND AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY OF THE NEIGHBORS, </p><p>SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PREDICAMENT OF THE MUGABE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ALL OF THEM REALIZE THAT A BREAK WITH </p><p>THE PAST HAS TO BE MADE, AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS </p><p>WILL BE A DIFFICULT PROCESS, BUT DO NOT WANT TO </p><p>SUFFER UNNECESSARY COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN THE PROCESS. </p><p>HE POINTED OUT THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAD LAID ITS CARDS </p><p>ON THE TABLE AT THE ONSET OF THE MEETING, TELLING THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS THAT: A) FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IS </p><p>DOWN SEVERELY IN SOUTH AFRICA AND INDEED WAS </p><p>INSUFFICIENT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY, A </p><p>DEVELOPMENT THEY BLAME ON REGIONAL "CONTAGION" (READ </p><p>ZIMABWE, THE CONGO, MOZAMBIQUE FLOODING AND TERM </p><p>EXTENSIONS IN NAMIBIA AND ZAMBIA); B) THAT CAPITAL </p><p>FLIGHT FROM SOUTH AFRICA IS ACCELERATING (BLAMED ON </p><p>THE SAME "CONTAGION"); AND, C) THAT ALL THE MAJOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01124  02 OF 02  270558Z </p><p>DONOR COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U.S., THE EU AND </p><p>BRITAIN WERE TURNING UP THE HEAT ON SOUTH AFRICA TO </p><p>DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH ZIMABBWE. </p><p> </p><p>== ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MBEKI/MUGABE MEETING, </p><p>(REFTEL REFERS), HE TOO HAD HEARD THAT IT MIGHT OCCUR </p><p>AT THE END OF THIS WEEK ON MBEKI\'S TRIP BACK FROM </p><p>CUBA, BUT NO HARD ANNOUNCEMENT HAD BEEN MADE YET. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMBERBACH REALIZES THAT HIS EFFORTS AT </p><p>BAILING ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE WATER VOLUME COMING </p><p>INTO THE HOLD, BUT PUSHES ON OUT OF PROFESSIONAL </p><p>DEDICATION AND PATRIOTISM.  HE SMELLS MORE TROUBLE </p><p>AHEAD, AND WE PLACE HIGH REGARD IN HIS EXPERIENCE AND </p><p>PROGNOSTICATION SKILLS.  THOUGH HE WAS HONEST WITH </p><p>US, WE BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FORTHCOMING </p><p>AND SPECIFIC HAD NOT A MEMBER OF HIS STAFF BEEN IN </p><p>ATTENDANCE, BUT HIS FRANK ADMISSION THAT PASSION </p><p>OVERULES THOUGHT IN NATIONAL LEADERSHIP IS VALID.  THE </p><p>VISIT ALLOWED US TO HEAR A REFRESHING IF LONELY VOICE </p><p>OF REASON.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
