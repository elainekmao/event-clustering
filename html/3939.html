<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001310 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, PGOV, PREL, BG, TH, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: ARAKAN ROHINGYA NATIONAL ORGANIZATION CONTACTS </p><p>WITH AL QAEDA AND WITH BURMESE INSURGENT GROUPS ON THE THAI </p><p>BORDER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Under pressure from Bangladesh, the Arakan </p><p>Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) contacted the Karenni </p><p>National Progressive Party in late August 2002 regarding the </p><p>possibility of relocating its bases to KNPP-controlled </p><p>territory on the border between Thailand and Burma. According </p><p>to a report prepared by Burmese military intelligence, ARNO </p><p>also sought membership in the Democratic Alliance of Burma, a </p><p>loose confederation of Burmese insurgent groups now operating </p><p>on the Thai/Burmese border.   KNPP reportedly refused ARNO\'s </p><p>request.  The DAB also rejected ARNO\'s application for </p><p>membership, but has forged a "military alliance" with ARNO, </p><p>according to the paper.  The Burmese also report that ARNO\'s </p><p>Chairman Nurul Islam, has received a U.S. visa and is en </p><p>route to the United States via Saudi Arabia.  The facts in </p><p>the Burmese paper appear plausible.  Its purpose is probably </p><p>to draw a connection between Al Qaeda, which has supported </p><p>ARNO, and Burmese insurgent groups active on the Thai border. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The following are edited excerpts from a Burmese </p><p>military intelligence report on the Arakan Rohingya National </p><p>Organization.  It was given to us on October 7 by Brigadier </p><p>General Kyaw Thein, ostensibly to clarify recent news reports </p><p>alleging connections between Al Qaeda and ARNO forces based </p><p>in Burma.  According to Kyaw Thein, there are links between </p><p>ARNO and Al Qaeda, but all of ARNO\'s bases are in southeast </p><p>Bangladesh. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) -- Its </p><p>Historical Background & Latest Situation (Sept, 2002) </p><p> </p><p>Historical Background </p><p> </p><p>Muslim Terrorist-Insurrection groups such as the Rohingya </p><p>Solidarity Organization (RSO), Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front </p><p>(ARIF) and Hak Kavt group combined and established the </p><p>Rohingya National Council (RNC) on 28 October, 1998.  The RNC </p><p>was then reorganized as the Arakan Rohingya National Council </p><p>(ARNC).  The Rohingya Liberation Army (RLA) was also formed </p><p>by combining all the armed insurgents of the groups.  The </p><p>Arakan Rohingya National Organization was formed to organize </p><p>all the different Rohingya insurgents into one group under </p><p>pressure from Muslim groups outside Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Organization of ARNO </p><p> </p><p>The headquarters of ARNO was opened at No. (30 Ju-ma-khar </p><p>street, Ju-ma-khar ward, Chittagong in Bangladesh.  Their </p><p>camps are based at Zai-Lar-Saw-Ri HQ camp--map reference </p><p>(PG-2916), Daw-Maw-Sri camp--map reference (P6-0537) and </p><p>Kyar-Laung-Taik camp--map reference (PG-2026).  ARNO group </p><p>had an estimated strength of about 200 insurgents, of whom </p><p>about 170 are equipped with a variety of arms.  A Central </p><p>Committee of ARNO is organized as follows: </p><p> </p><p>(a)  Chairman </p><p>(b)  Military Commander </p><p>(c)  Secretary </p><p>(d)  Asst Secretary (Chittagong Office-in-Charge) </p><p>(e)  Central Committee Member (Asst Military-in-Charge) </p><p>(f)  do </p><p>(g)  Central Committee Member </p><p>(h)  do </p><p>(i)  do </p><p>(j)  Foreign Liaison-in-Charge </p><p>(k)  Foreign Fund Raiser </p><p>(l)  Representative for Malaysia </p><p>(m)  Cox\'s Bazaar District Organizer </p><p>(n)  Finance Officer </p><p>(o)  Liaison Officer </p><p>(p)  Advisor </p><p>(q)  Camp Commander (Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp) </p><p>(r)  Deputy Camp Commander </p><p>(s)  Camp Commander (Daw-Maw-Sri Camp) </p><p>(t)  Camp Commander (Kya-Long-Taik Camp) </p><p> </p><p>Meeting of Five Members of ARNO with Taliban leader Osama Bin </p><p>Laden </p><p> </p><p>Five members (names still under inquiry by the GOB) of ARNO </p><p>attended a high-ranking officers\' course with Al Qaeda </p><p>representatives on 15 May, 2000 and arrived back in </p><p>Bangladesh on 22 June.  During the course, they discussed </p><p>matters relating to political and military affairs, arms and </p><p>ammunition, and financing with Osama Bin Laden.  Mohamed Arju </p><p>Taida and Mohamed Rau-Sheik Ar-Mar Darsi from the Taliban </p><p>were present with them at the meeting.  Ninety members of </p><p>ARNO were selected to attend a guerrilla warfare course, a </p><p>variety of explosives courses and heavy-weapons courses held </p><p>in Libya and Afghanistan in August, 2001.  Thirteen out of </p><p>these selected members participated in the explosives and </p><p>heavy-weapons training. </p><p> </p><p>Arrival of Two Taliban at ARNO Headquarters </p><p> </p><p>Al Ha-Saud and Al Ja-hid, two members of Taliban group, </p><p>arrived at ARNO\'s headquarters in Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp on 2 </p><p>November, 2001 from the Rohingya Solidarity Organization\'s </p><p>(RSO) Kann-Grat-Chaung camp.  They met with Nur Islam </p><p>(Chairman), ZaFaur-Ahmed (Secretary) and Fayos Ahmed (acting </p><p>Chief-of-Staff Army), ARNO, and discussed the reorganization </p><p>of RSO and ARNO.  It was learned that ARNO/RSO and Taliban </p><p>groups planned to hold a meeting on 15 November, 2001. Nur </p><p>Islam, Chairman of ARNO, also declared that the Arakan </p><p>Rohingya Islamic Front (ARIF) and the Rohingya Solidarity </p><p>Organization (RSO) had agreed to reorganize as integrated </p><p>members of ARNO. However, Mullah Dil-Mar from RSO did not </p><p>agree with this re-organization and resigned with his </p><p>entourage of insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Correspondents Arrived at ARNO Headquarters </p><p> </p><p>Ban-Draban correspondent from Bangladesh, Ha-Saud-Ahmed and </p><p>two foreign correspondents (still under inquiry by GOB) went </p><p>to ARNO\'s headquarters at the Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp and met with </p><p>the acting Camp Commander who was Chief-of-Staff Army Salein. </p><p>They inquired about the following data. </p><p> </p><p>(a)  Day, Month and Year of establishment of ARNO </p><p>organization. </p><p>(b)  Attitude and objective. </p><p>(c)  The year the ARNO had departed from Myanmar. </p><p>(d)  Present strength of forces and fighters. </p><p>(e)  Types of Arms and Quantity. </p><p>(f)  Is it to build Rakhine as a separate and an independent </p><p>(State/Nation) or to ask for Democracy? </p><p>(g)  List of Anti-Myanmar groups in Bangladesh. </p><p>(h)  Muslim organizations and Non-Muslim organizations in </p><p>Bangladesh to be separately identified. </p><p>(i)  Necessary funding and funding countries. </p><p>(j)  The present financial situation. </p><p> </p><p>Vice Chairman of ARNO Fayos Ahmed\'s Meeting with Insurgent </p><p>Leaders based and active in Thailand </p><p> </p><p>Fayos Ahmed, Vice-Chairman of ARNO, along with U Maung Lu Gyi </p><p>from NUPA (National Unity Party of Arakan), arrived in </p><p>Bangkok from Bangladesh on 27 August, 2002 and proceeded to </p><p>Chiang Mai.  Then, through the Burma Border Consortium, </p><p>including the help of an English woman named Mrs. Pippa </p><p>Curwen, wife of DAB Aye Saung, they talked with the leaders </p><p>of KNPP (Karenni National Progress Party) -- Aung Than Lay </p><p>(Vice Chairman), Raymond Htoo (General Secretary), U Khu-Ral </p><p>(joint General Secretary) and Aung Myat (Chief of Staff - </p><p>Army).  Fayos Ahmed said that ARNO had been told to leave </p><p>Bangladesh by the Bangladesh authorities and that it was </p><p>difficult for them to continue in Bangladesh.  He also </p><p>mentioned that the USA and other various organizations were </p><p>continuously watching them on account of assumed contacts </p><p>with the Al-Qaeda group.  So he asked for a camp to be opened </p><p>in a suitable place in the area of KNPP, in as much as </p><p>Thailand was the most suitable country for them. </p><p> </p><p>Then Fayos Ahmed met with Mai-Aik-Hpone, Secretary of </p><p>Pa-Laung State Liberation Front (PSLF), Khun-Okkar, Chairman </p><p>of Pa-O People Liberation Organization (PPLO) and Aye Maung </p><p>from the Lahu national group.  In addition, he discussed the </p><p>ARNO\'s critical situation with Chiang Mai-based VOA, BBC and </p><p>RFA news media, NGOs in Thailand and Shwe-Kharr of the Chin </p><p>National Front (CNF).  He proceeded from Chiang Mai to Mae </p><p>Sod on 5 September and talked with Bo Mya (Vice-Chairman), </p><p>Pado Man-Sha (General Secretary) and Tar-Ma-La-Baw at KNU </p><p>headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>Fayos Ahmed discussed with KNU the above mentioned matters </p><p>and the possibility of ARNO\'s becoming a member of DAB. </p><p>Application for a membership in DAB by ARNO was not granted </p><p>on the objection of Aung Sein Tha from Democratic Party of </p><p>Arakan (DPA) and Khaing Soe Aung from Arakan Liberation Party </p><p>(ALP).  Both Khaing Soe Aung and Aung Sein Tha bitterly </p><p>rejected the proposal on the grounds that the Rohingya were </p><p>not indigenous to Rakhine State and that they could not </p><p>accept them at all as ethnic people.  Though DAB has not </p><p>granted the membership to ARNO, it has made a military </p><p>alliance with ARNO. </p><p> </p><p>According to Fayos Ahmed, ARNO Military-in-Charge, Salem </p><p>Ulah, had contacts with Al-Qaeda and some members of ARNO </p><p>forces were arrested when they were sent to join the Taliban </p><p>in Afghanistan and attacked the Americans.  These ARNO forces </p><p>were sent to Afghanistan along with Rohingya groups in </p><p>Karachi, Pakistan. Rohingya groups are in many countries like </p><p>Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, UAE, Palestine and </p><p>Australia.  Chairman Nurul Islam has received an American </p><p>visa and departed for Saudi Arabia from Bangladesh, with an </p><p>intent to reside in Saudi Arabia for a short period and then </p><p>depart for the United States.  Fayos Ahmed, during his short </p><p>stay in Thailand, met with Dr. Allen from NCGUB Foreign </p><p>Affairs Department, David Htaw from KNU and David Smile from </p><p>Burma Lawyer Council (BLC).  He went to Thailand as an editor </p><p>of a news media and returned to Bangladesh on 12 September. </p><p> </p><p>Investigation of Members of Rohingya Jihad Caught in Singapore </p><p> </p><p>Hanbali and Baasyia are leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah </p><p>(JI)-organized Rabitatul Mujahideen group which was involved </p><p>in the whole region as a Muslim organization.  Through </p><p>contacts with Muslim groups in the region, active cooperation </p><p>was achieved in matters of training, weapons-buying, </p><p>financing, exchange of information and terrorist military </p><p>operations.  The other organizations which cooperated were </p><p>Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM), two organizations in Southern </p><p>Thailand and Rakhine and Rohingya terrorist-insurgents in </p><p>Myanmar.  ARNO has established a contact with Al-Qaeda and </p><p>five Central Committee members of ARNO paid a visit to </p><p>Afghanistan in April, 2001.  Besides, ARNO has also </p><p>cooperated with Republic of Islam Aceh (RIA) and Egyptian </p><p>Jammah Jihad Mesir (JJM).  It is believed that there exists a </p><p>small community of Rohingya\'s in Patuwat, Malaysia. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Burmese report has enough specificity to make it </p><p>generally plausible. The Government of Bangladesh advised </p><p>ARNO in May that it had to clear out of its bases in </p><p>southeastern Bangladesh and, shortly thereafter, 195 members </p><p>of the Arakan Army turned themselves in to the Burmese.  As </p><p>yet, ARNO has not moved from Bangladesh.  According to the </p><p>Burmese, ARNO and RSO together still maintain eight bases in </p><p>Bangladesh.  If the Burmese report is correct, however, they </p><p>are looking for a new base of operations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Burmese view all these groups as terrorists. </p><p>Their purpose in giving us this report is to make sure we are </p><p>aware of the alleged contacts between ARNO and the Burmese </p><p>insurgent groups on the Thai border.  Presumably, they hope </p><p>to bolster relations with the United States by getting credit </p><p>for cooperation on the CT front.  End Summary. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
