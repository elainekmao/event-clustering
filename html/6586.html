<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 000795 </p><p> </p><p>D FOR BARRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, LE, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: LEBANESE, PALESTINIAN FACTIONS UNITED IN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO IRAQ WAR </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE LEADERS OF 34 LEBANESE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES AND 11 PALESTINIAN FACTIONS, A GROUPING THAT MEETS </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES ANNUALLY, HELD AN "EXCEPTIONAL AND URGENT" </p><p>MEETING MARCH 19.  THE GROUP ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE CALLING FOR </p><p>BOYCOTTING U.S. PRODUCTS, "ENCIRCLING" U.S. AND COALITION </p><p>EMBASSIES, AND DENOUNCING THE SYRIAN ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.  THE </p><p>STATEMENT ALSO PRAISED THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA AS THE BEST </p><p>"ROAD" FOR THE PALESTINIANS VICE THE "SO-CALLED ROADMAP," AND </p><p>REASSERTED THE RIGHT OF THE "RESISTANCE" TO CONFRONT ANY </p><p>ISRAELI AGGRESSION.  SOLIDARITY ACROSS FACTIONS HAS BEEN </p><p>BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE BREWING REGIONAL CRISIS.  HIZBALLAH </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH EMERGED AS THE GATHERING\'S </p><p>SPOKESPERSON, SUGGESTING THAT THE OTHER LEADERS CONSIDER HIM </p><p>TO BE THE ACTOR BEST ABLE TO RALLY NATIONAL UNITY DURING THIS </p><p>CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE LEADERS OF MANY OF LEBANON\'S DIVERSE, </p><p>CONFESSIONALLY-BASED POLITICAL PARTIES AND 11 PALESTINIAN </p><p>FACTIONS HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING MARCH 19 TO DEVISE A </p><p>"NATIONAL" APPROACH TO THE WAR IN IRAQ.  FOLLOWING THE CLOSED </p><p>SESSION, HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE. </p><p>NASRALLAH SAID POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS WERE UNITED IN THEIR </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE U.S. WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  HE CALLED ON ALL </p><p>ARABS TO CONTINUE TO REJECT WAR, TO BOYCOTT U.S. PRODUCTS AND </p><p>THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND TO "ENCIRCLE" U.S. AND COALITION </p><p>EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE.  NASRALLAH STRESSED THE "READINESS OF </p><p>THE RESISTANCE TO MEET ANY ISRAELI AGGRESSION," AND WARNED </p><p>THAT EVENTS IN IRAQ WOULD LEAD TO A REDRAWING OF THE REGIONAL </p><p>MAP WITH INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT A </p><p>NATIONAL EMERGENCY COMMITTEE WOULD BE FORMED TO COORDINATE </p><p>PLANS AND THAT ANTI-SYRIAN CHRISTIAN OPPOSITION GROUP QORNET </p><p>SHEHWAN WOULD BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE.  DRUZE LEADER WALID </p><p>JUMBLATT APPLAUDED THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT LAHOUD AND THE </p><p>MARONITE PATRIARCH FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD, AND STATED THAT WHILE NO ONE SUPPORTS SADDAM HUSSEIN, </p><p>"DEMOCRACY CANNOT BE BROUGHT IN ON AN AMERICAN TANK."  A </p><p>WORKING LEVEL MEETING OF THE SAME FACTIONS IS SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>MARCH 20 TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  POLITICAL LEADERS\' EXPRESSION OF UNITY IN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO WAR IN IRAQ APPEARS PREDOMINANTLY AIMED AT </p><p>PROVIDING POLITICAL COVER, GIVEN SYRIAN PRESSURE TO KEEP A </p><p>LID ON LEBANON DURING THE CONFLICT.  AMBASSADOR SPOKE WITH </p><p>PRIME MINISTER HARIRI AND DRUZE MINISTER OF THE DISPLACED </p><p>MARWAN HAMADEH ON MARCH 20, BOTH OF WHOM USED THE PHRASE </p><p>"SIT-IN" TO DESCRIBE PLANS FOR POSSIBLE ACTIVITIES DIRECTED </p><p>AT COALITION EMBASSIES IN BEIRUT.  FORMER MP MARWAN ABU FADEL </p><p>TOLD US THE MEETING AND RESULTING COMMUNIQUE WERE NECESSARY </p><p>IN ORDER TO DEFLATE TENSION IN THE STREET BY EXPRESSING </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH\'S </p><p>EMERGENCE AS THE GATHERING\'S KEY SPOKESMAN MAY BE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT.  THERE APPEARS TO BE TACIT, IF BEGRUDGING, </p><p>AGREEMENT AMONG CONFESSIONAL LEADERS THAT NASRALLAH IS THE </p><p>ONLY FIGURE WHO CAN PUT SUBSTANCE BEHIND THEIR CALL FOR A </p><p>UNIFIED POSITION.  NASRALLAH\'S CREDENTIALS AS LIBERATOR OF </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED BY LEBANESE OF ALL </p><p>FACTIONS, HE LEADS A FORCE WHICH IS WELL PLACED TO THREATEN </p><p>TO RESPOND TO ISRAELI ACTIONS DIRECTED AT LEBANON; AND HE IS </p><p>COMFORTABLY UNDER THE ULTIMATE CONTROL OF BROTHER SYRIA. </p><p>NASRALLAH, WHOSE ACTIONS IN PAST MONTHS SUGGEST AN INCREASING </p><p>DESIRE TO PLAY A MORE ESTABLISHMENT ROLE, MAY BE CAPITALIZING </p><p>ON THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIS TWO-PRONGED PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS CAMPAIGN -- ONE FOR THE WEST AND ONE FOR THE </p><p>REGION. (SEPTEL).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
