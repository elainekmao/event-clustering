(S/NF)  Ambassador, DCM and RSO met with Interior </p><p>Minister Alimi and Political Security Organization (PSO) </p><p>Chief Gamish for two hours on March 19 (details reported </p><p>septel).  Gamish said that President Saleh has given PSO/MOI </p><p>the mission of protecting Americans and close coordination </p><p>would be key.  MOI agreed.

(S/NF)  Embassy investigative team returned from Marib </p><p>the evening of March 19, and at this stage, there is no </p><p>information indicating that the tragic incident was anything </p><p>other than a criminal attack.  Investigators have several </p><p>strong leads to continue their inquiry.  A clear picture is </p><p>emerging of how the slayings occurred; however, the shooter\'s </p><p>motive remains unclear.  Investigation has yet to uncover any </p><p>anti-Western or extremist views by the perpetrator. </p><p>Witnesses confirm that the shooter had sleeping problems and </p><p>was involved in a family dispute, and he was on several kinds </p><p>of medication.  Contrary to press reports, no evidence </p><p>confirms allegations that the shooter had been a poor </p><p>employee or fired at any time.  Embassy is providing other </p><p>assistance as needed.  Details reported septel.  See </p><p>paragraph 8 for the March 20 public statement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Threats, Security and </p><p>StandFast 3/20 COB for Iraq Contingency </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.

(C)  RSO reported the guidance on the access of vehicles </p><p>and personnel (American and FSN) would be disseminated via </p><p>Administrative Notice.  He also said that a room in the </p><p>Sheraton Hotel had been identified to act as a gathering </p><p>point for Embassy personnel staying there.  The Alternate </p><p>Command Center is ready and three employees will staff it </p><p>during StandFast. </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Consular and Warden Messages </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  CONS Chief said they were coordinating with all </p><p>sections on the request from MOI for information on Americans </p><p>for protective purposes.  Per privacy act provisions, CONS is </p><p>contacting all Americans to get permission for release of </p><p>information before providing it to the government </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>7.
