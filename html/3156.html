<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001810 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ETRD, ECON, NI, AGOA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AN AGOA POWERHOUSE AFTER ALL? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  In contrast to the widespread view that </p><p>Nigeria is ill prepared to benefit from the Africa </p><p>Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a survey by textile </p><p>and apparel consultants Jack S. Smith and Heidi </p><p>Scheller suggests the Nigerian textile and apparel </p><p>industry could become a primary AGOA beneficiary. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Nigerian Textile and Apparel Industry Findings </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   On June 7, Smith and Scheller briefed POL/C, </p><p>EconOff, and Tom Hutcheson of USAID about their survey </p><p>of the Nigerian textile and apparel industry.  The </p><p>level of sophistication of the industry surprised the </p><p>consultants.  They concluded Nigerian textiles had </p><p>tremendous export potential and could play an </p><p>important role in filling the entire continental quota </p><p>under AGOA.  At the same time, they noted the apparel </p><p>industry is underdeveloped, almost non-existent.  That </p><p>situation, however, might be quickly turned around </p><p>through direct investment, which could be generated if </p><p>the textile section took off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    From 2005 on, cloth for apparel entering the </p><p>U.S. under AGOA must either be produced in the U.S. or </p><p>in an eligible sub-Saharan country.   Thus apparel- </p><p>producing nations such as Mauritius and Lesotho that </p><p>are using Asian textiles will have to find another </p><p>source.  Nigeria could easily put itself in position </p><p>to capitalize.  Even before 2005, Nigerian textile </p><p>manufacturers could profit under AGOA if they would </p><p>seek to establish business relations with apparel </p><p>producers in the AGOA-active countries.  They believe </p><p>that Nigeria cotton production would need to be </p><p>quickly increased to meet the greater demand. The </p><p>consultants also stated that Nigeria has ample labor </p><p>at competitive rates and its ports have competitive </p><p>container rates that would facilitate export. </p><p>However, the consultants identified problems such as </p><p>uncertain regulatory/political environment, high </p><p>interest rates, poor exchange rates, low labor </p><p>productivity, no incentive-based payroll tradition </p><p>(being paid by the piece) in the textile or garment </p><p>industry, and Nigeria\'s lack of experience in global </p><p>marketing.  They also emphasized that both the textile </p><p>and apparel industries are extremely time sensitive. </p><p>Orders must be filled in a timely manner.  To do this, </p><p>Nigeria must streamline export procedures, </p><p>particularly port clearance operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Mr. Smith and Dr. Scheller concluded that, based </p><p>on their experience in Central America and other parts </p><p>of the world, Nigeria\'s problems could be overcome and </p><p>the country could easily become one of the biggest </p><p>beneficiaries of AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment: This gives a fresh perspective to </p><p>Nigerian textiles, an industry hard hit by second-hand </p><p>clothing and the smuggling of Asian cloth into the </p><p>market.  Before Nigeria can obtain the benefits </p><p>envisioned, the GON must complete its textile visa </p><p>process.  A critical part of that process is </p><p>legislation creating new and adequate penalties for </p><p>trans-shipment.  Despite reports that this bill will </p><p>be passed any day, there has been no movement in the </p><p>National Assembly.  We confirmed this during a </p><p>subsequent call on House Finance Committee Chair </p><p>Mohammed Sanusi Daggash, who, nevertheless, promises </p><p>the legislation will be ready by the end of June. </p><p>Despite its bureaucratic difficulties in passing the </p><p>AGOA visa system, Nigeria still holds great export </p><p>potential in textiles.   Because of the difficulty for </p><p>other African countries to replicate the capital- </p><p>intensive sophisticated textile production sites in </p><p>Lagos, Kaduna and Kano, Nigeria will almost certainly </p><p>benefit from the 2005 changes in AGOA.  However, to </p><p>reap the full benefits of AGOA would require the </p><p>development of the apparel sector.  The necessary </p><p>direct investment to energize that sector will not </p><p>come in until there is a working textile visa system, </p><p>and an improvement in export infrastructure, </p><p>especially ports.  This will require continued </p><p>engagement with the GON to reform export policy, and </p><p>improved performance by Customs, the Nigerian </p><p>Investment Promotion Council, the Nigerian Export </p><p>Promotion Council, the Ministry of Transport and the </p><p>Ministry of Commerce. End comment. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
