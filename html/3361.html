SUMMARY: THE NORTHEASTERN ITALIAN TRANSPORTATION </p><p>CENTERS IN VENICE AND TRIESTE HAVE RELIED PRIMARILY ON </p><p>INCREASED INTERMODALITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT </p><p>FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THE PORT OF TRIESTE, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HAS STRONG LINKS TO THE ITALIAN RAILWAYS AND </p><p>IS AGGRESSIVELY SEEKING INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS TO </p><p>BEAT ITS COMPETITION IN NORTHERN EUROPE.  WHILE SECURITY </p><p>AT ALL SITES VISITED REMAINS A CONCERN, OFFICIALS </p><p>REPORTED THAT EVERY PRECAUTION IS BEING TAKEN TO PROTECT </p><p>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE SEE GROWING MARKET </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.S. FIRMS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO </p><p>INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION </p><p>LINKS AND ENHANCING SECURITY THROUGH INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY (IT).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>2. AS PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT TO GATHER INFORMATION ON </p><p>ITALY\'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, ECONOFF VISITED </p><p>MAJOR NORTHEAST ITALY TRANSPORTATION HUBS IN VENICE AND </p><p>TRIESTE.  TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF INTERMODALITY IN THE </p><p>AREA, WE MET WITH OFFICIALS AT THE VENICE AIRPORT, THE </p><p>TRIESTE AIRPORT, THE TRIESTE RAILWAY STATION, AND THE </p><p>PORT OF TRIESTE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03641  01 OF 04  270634Z </p><p> </p><p>3. WE FOUND THAT LEVELS OF INTERMODALITY VARIED GREATLY. </p><p>WHILE THE PORT OF TRIESTE (WITH EXCELLENT LINKS TO RAIL </p><p>AND ROAD LINES) IS A VIRTUAL CASE STUDY IN </p><p>INTERMODALITY, THE TRIESTE AIRPORT COULD NOT BE MORE </p><p>ISOLATED.  THE VENICE AIRPORT (WITH A NEWLY INAUGURATED </p><p>AIR TERMINAL) IS WELL SUITED TO HANDLE THE MANY TOURISTS </p><p>IT RECEIVES AND AIRPORT AUTHORITIES ARE HOPING TO </p><p>ENHANCE ITS LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. </p><p>WHILE ALMOST NINE MONTHS HAD PAST BETWEEN THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OUR TRIP, REASSURANCES OF </p><p>ENHANCED SECURITY (AND CONDOLENCES) WERE OFFERED IN MANY </p><p>OF OUR CONVERSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE AIRPORTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>THE VENICE AIRPORT </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4. AIRPORT DIRECTOR VALERIO BONATO (RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH </p><p>VENICE AND TRIESTE AIRPORTS) HOSTED A ROUND-TABLE </p><p>MEETING WITH ROBERTO COIN, DIRECTOR OF SAVE S.P.A. (THE </p><p>VENICE AIRPORT HANDLING COMPANY); SALVATORE FORTE, </p><p>AIRPORT SECURITY MANAGER; PAOLO FURLAN, POLICE CHIEF OF </p><p>THE AIRPORT AND PORT OF VENICE; AND DOMENICO MARIA </p><p>TEDESCHI OF THE CUSTOMS AGENCY.  MUCH OF THE </p><p>CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON THE OVER 250 MILLION DOLLARS IN </p><p>INVESTMENTS SINCE 1996 TO IMPROVE THE AIRPORT\'S </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03641  01 OF 04  270634Z </p><p>5. LOCATED ON A STRIP OF LAND BETWEEN THE PO RIVER AND </p><p>THE VENICE LAGOON, VENICE\'S MARCO POLO AIRPORT HANDLED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION PASSENGERS IN 2001, UP FROM </p><p>THREE MILLION IN 1997. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ARRIVING </p><p>PASSENGERS VISIT VENICE FOR TOURISM, WITH ABOUT TWO </p><p>MILLION ALSO EMBARKING ON CRUISES ORIGINATING IN THE </p><p>CITY (SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE AIRPORTS SCHEDULED </p><p>TRAFFIC IS INTERNATIONAL).  (NOTE: VENICE IS ALSO THE </p><p>FIRST ITALIAN REGIONAL AIRPORT WHERE A U.S. COMPANY </p><p>(DELTA) IS OPERATING, WITH DAILY FLIGHTS TO NEW YORK IN </p><p>THE SUMMER SEASON AND FIVE WEEKLY FLIGHTS IN THE WINTER </p><p>SEASON.  THE COMMERCIAL MANAGER FOR DELTA TOLD US THAT, </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO MILAN\'S TROUBLED MALPENSA AIRPORT, </p><p>SERVICES PROVIDED BY MARCO POLO AIRPORT ARE EXCELLENT. </p><p>END NOTE.)  BONATO POINTED OUT THAT THE AIRPORTS\' TWO </p><p>RUNWAYS SERVE THE OVER HALF MILLION COMPANIES IN THE </p><p>AREA.  TO BETTER SERVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, </p><p>AUTHORITIES INSTALLED A NEW CARGO AREA IN 2001, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES A 6,000 SQUARE METER WAREHOUSE.

THE PROJECT COST </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 75 MILLION EURO AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE </p><p>42 MILLION EURO CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW CONTROL TOWER (THE </p><p>OLD TERMINAL WILL STILL BE USED, BUT SOLELY FOR CHARTER </p><p>TRAFFIC AND REGIONAL AIR COMPANIES).  THE IMPRESSIVE NEW </p><p>TERMINAL INCLUDES A DOUBLE-LEVEL ROAD SYSTEM AND A </p><p>MULTI-STORY CAR PARK.  THE AIRPORT SECURITY MANAGER TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE TERMINAL IS ALREADY EQUIPPED TO SCREEN ONE </p><p>HUNDRED PERCENT OF CHECKED BAGGAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7. SITUATED ABOUT TWELVE KILOMETERS FROM VENICE, THE </p><p>AIRPORT IS WELL CONNECTED VIA FERRIES AND BUSES TO THE </p><p>CITY, ITS TWO RAILWAY STATIONS (MESTRE AND THE MORE- </p><p>CENTRALIZED SANTA LUCIA STATION), AND OTHER AREA TOWNS. </p><p>THE NEW TERMINAL, ABOUT 300 YARDS AWAY FROM THE OLD ONE, </p><p>IS CONNECTED BY BUS TO THE OLD STATION AND SOON WILL </p><p>ALSO BE CONNECTED BY A MECHANIZED PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY. </p><p> </p><p>8. POLICE CHIEF FURLAN EXPLAINED THAT ALL INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE AIRPORT\'S SECURITY MEET MONTHLY TO COORDINATE THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS AND TO DECIDE UPON NEW SECURITY PROCEDURES.  ONE </p><p>IDEA HE IS HOPING TO IMPLEMENT IS THE PHOTOGRAPHING OF </p><p>PILOTS AND CREWS THE NIGHT BEFORE A FLIGHT.  THE PHOTOS </p><p>WILL THEN BE MATCHED AGAINST CREWS BEFORE BOARDING AN </p><p>AIRCRAFT.

IN CONTRAST TO VENICE\'S AIRPORT WHICH IS LARGE, </p><p>GROWING, AND WELL CONNECTED TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORT, </p><p>TRIESTE\'S RONCHI DEI LEGIONARI AIRPORT (ABOUT 145 </p><p>KILOMETERS AWAY) LIES ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE KILOMETERS FROM </p><p>THE MUCH SMALLER CITY\'S LIMITS AND THEREFORE IS LESS </p><p>PASSENGER-FRIENDLY (AND LESS UTILIZED).  DEPUTY AIRPORT </p><p>DIRECTOR ENRICO MARTUCCI STATED THAT, WHILE THE AIRPORT </p><p>WAS BUILT TO HANDLE AN ANNUAL CAPACITY OF TWO MILLION </p><p>PASSENGERS, LESS THAN ONE MILLION ACTUALLY TRANSIT THE </p><p>AIRPORT.  WHILE BUS LINES DO CONNECT THE AIRPORT TO THE </p><p>CITY, FREQUENT TRAFFIC PROBLEMS OFTEN MAKE THE TRIP AN </p><p>HOUR LONG.  NO TRAINS RUN FROM TRIESTE RAIL STATION TO </p><p>THE AIRPORT.  AIRPORT HANDLING COMPANY DIRECTOR PAOLO </p><p>STRADI ASSURED US THAT NEW SECURITY EQUIPMENT WOULD SOON </p><p>BE PURCHASED IN ORDER TO MEET THE EU-IMPOSED DEADLINE </p><p>FOR ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CHECKED BAGGAGE SCREENING. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THE PORTS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>THE PORT OF VENICE </p><p>------------------ </p><p>10.

HE ALLEGED THAT, IN ORDER TO BETTER DETECT </p><p>THESE INTENDING IMMIGRANTS, A NEW INSTRUMENT THAT PICKS- </p><p>UP A STOWAWAY\'S HEARTBEAT INSIDE A CONTAINER IS IN USE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03641  02 OF 04  270635Z </p><p>(NOTE: NEITHER ECON NOR POST\'S CUSTOMS OFFICE HAS </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF ANY SUCH DEVICES BUT ARE SEEKING </p><p>INFORMATION ON THEM.

MAURIZIO MARESCA, PRESIDENT OF THE TRIESTE PORT </p><p>AUTHORITY, AND HIS STAFF EXPLAINED HOW THE PORT OF </p><p>TRIESTE CONSIDERS ITS HOME NOT ONLY ITALY, BUT ALSO THE </p><p>WHOLE OF CENTRAL EUROPE.  THE ORIGIN OR FINAL </p><p>DESTINATION OF MOST OF THE GOODS PASSING THROUGH THE </p><p>PORT LIE IN NORTHERN ITALY, SWITZERLAND, AUSTRIA, </p><p>GERMANY, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, SLOVAKIA, SLOVENIA, </p><p>HUNGARY, AND THE BALKANS.

OVER TWENTY MILLION TONS OF GOODS WERE OFF-LOADED </p><p>AT THE PORT (AND SENT ONWARD OVER LAND) IN THE FIRST </p><p>HALF OF 2002, SEVENTEEN MILLION OF WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED </p><p>AS EITHER OIL OR MINERALS.  OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD, </p><p>ALMOST THREE MILLION TONS OF GOODS DEPARTED FROM THE </p><p>PORT.  PRIVATE SECURITY AND LOCAL POLICE PATROL THE PORT </p><p>OR MAINTAIN CHECKPOINTS TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY, SEVEN </p><p>DAYS A WEEK.

MARESCA EXPLAINED THAT HIS BUSINESS VISION FOR THE </p><p>PORT INCLUDES GREAT ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH NEW AND </p><p>EXPANDED SEA-BORN TRAFFIC FLOWS, DUE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03641  03 OF 04  270635Z </p><p>IN EASTERN EUROPE, AND AN ACCOMPANYING LACK OF DIRECT </p><p>ACCESS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN FOR COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRIA, </p><p>SWITZERLAND, AND GERMANY.  THE PORT\'S COMPETITION, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, DOES NOT COME FROM OTHER PORTS IN ITALY, BUT </p><p>RATHER FROM NORTHERN EUROPEAN PORTS LIKE HAMBURG, </p><p>GERMANY.  HE NOTED WITH PRIDE THAT TRIESTE IS 7,760 </p><p>NAUTICAL MILES FROM HONG KONG WHILE THE PORT OF HAMBURG </p><p>IS ALMOST 10,000 NAUTICAL MILES DISTANT. </p><p> </p><p>14. TO FULFILL THIS VISION, THE PORT AUTHORITY HAS </p><p>(APPARENTLY EFFECTIVELY) ESTABLISHED A FULLY INTERMODAL </p><p>STRATEGY TO COORDINATE ROAD, RAIL, AND MARITIME </p><p>TRANSPORT.  LOCATED IN NORTHEAST ITALY, TRIESTE IS </p><p>WITHIN 450 KILOMETERS OF IMPORTANT URBAN CENTERS LIKE </p><p>VIENNA, BUDAPEST, PRAGUE, MUNICH, STUTTGART, ZURICH, AND </p><p>MILAN.  INLAND CONNECTIONS TO ALL OF THESE LOCATIONS </p><p>INCLUDE NUMEROUS TUNNELS THROUGH THE ALPS (THE BRENNER, </p><p>TARVISIO, AND FERNETTI PASSES).  TRIESTE\'S PORT IS THE </p><p>LARGEST RAIL-PORT IN SOUTHERN EUROPE, WITH SEVENTY-FIVE </p><p>KILOMETERS OF TRACK WITHIN THE PORT ITSELF (SERVING ALL </p><p>OF ITS DOCKS) AND LINKED TO THE EUROPEAN RAIL STATION </p><p>THROUGH THE AREAS RAIL STATIONS.  THE CERVIGNANO </p><p>INTERMODAL CENTER (A FEW KILOMETERS OUTSIDE OF TRIESTE) </p><p>FACILITATES THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN RAILCARS AND </p><p>TRUCKS, AND IN TURN THE MOVEMENT OF THE PORT\'S CARGO. </p><p>IN ANOTHER STRATEGIC MOVE, PORT OFFICIALS HAVE ENTERED </p><p>INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A RAILWAY TRANSPORT COMPANY IN </p><p>ORDER TO ASSURE THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS TO MUNICH. </p><p> </p><p>15. PORT AUTHORITY OFFICIALS RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR </p><p>GREATEST CHALLENGES INCLUDE A LACK OF PHYSICAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03641  03 OF 04  270635Z </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT).  TO </p><p>OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS, MARESCA IS FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF INTEGRATING WITH OTHER NORTHERN ADRIATIC </p><p>PORTS, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE PORT OF KOPER, SLOVENIA. </p><p>THIS INITIATIVE WOULD REQUIRE INCREASED TRANSPORTATION </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE (TO INCLUDE ROAD AND RAIL) ORDER TO </p><p>FACILITATE TRAFFIC FLOWS BETWEEN THE TWO PORTS AND TO </p><p>ONWARD DESTINATIONS.  MARESCA IS ALSO PUSHING FOR </p><p>ACTIONS FAVORABLE TO THE PORT LIKE THE CREATION OF </p><p>INTERMODAL LOGISTICS FACILITIES ALONG THE ROUTES TO </p><p>AUSTRIA AND GERMANY AND A HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINE TO </p><p>LJUBLJANA, BUDAPEST, AND KIEV.  HE IS ALSO SEEKING A </p><p>REDUCTION IN RAIL TARIFFS FOR TRANSPORT ALONG ROUTES TO </p><p>MUNICH AND VIENNA TO LEVELS ON PAR WITH THOSE APPLIED BY </p><p>GERMAN RAILWAYS TO THE PORT OF HAMBURG.  MARESCA HOPES </p><p>THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY SETTING UP A PRIVATE RAIL </p><p>COMPANY WHOSE SHAREHOLDERS WOULD INCLUDE AUSTRIAN, </p><p>SLOVENIAN, AND ITALIAN RAILWAYS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p>16. THE PORT AUTHORITY IS ALSO EMBARKING ON AN AMBITIOUS </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT INCLUDES THE </p><p>REDEVELOPMENT OF THE HISTORIC PORT (AND PART OF ITS </p><p>WATERFRONT) IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE A TOURIST/VISITOR- </p><p>FRIENDLY COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL AREA WITH RESTAURANTS, </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5925 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03641  04 OF 04  270658Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  G-00     SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------D0FC42  270659Z /25 </p><p>R 240540Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5046 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 04 OF 04 ROME 003641 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FOR FAA AND TSA </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR DAVID DEFALCO, ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCIP, EAIR, ELTN, EWWT, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: NE ITALY\'S TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03641  04 OF 04  270658Z </p><p>IMPRESSIVELY INTERMODAL </p><p> </p><p>BARS, CLUBS, AND SHOPS.
