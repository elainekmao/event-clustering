THE GOZ </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S PARANOID OPTICS MAY BE FOCUSING ON ITS </p><p>ALLIES, PARTICULARLY ANGOLA, AS SPECULATION AND RUMOR </p><p>ABOUND ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KABILA\'S DEATH. </p><p>TAKAVARASHA\'S COMMENTS ARE WORRISOME, AS HE SEEMED MORE </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT FINGERING KABILA\'S KILLER THAN USING THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY OF A CHANGE OF DRC LEADERSHIP TO ADVANCE THE </p><p>LUSAKA PEACE PROCESS.  WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A </p><p>MORE DEFINITIVE READOUT OF ZIMBABWE\'S THINKING AFTER THE </p><p>KEY PLAYERS RETURN FROM KABILA\'S FUNERAL THIS WEEK.
