SUMMARY:  A NEW SECTORAL LABOR CONTRACT FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>METALWORKERS HAMMERED OUT MAY 8 HAS REVERBERATED ACROSS THE </p><p>BUSINESS AND LABOR LANDSCAPE.  BOTH ITS CONTENT AND </p><p>NEGOTIATION ARE IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD IN MODERNIZING </p><p>TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AND POLICIES THAT HAVE LONG BEDEVILED </p><p>THE ITALIAN ECONOMY.  LABOR\'S SPLIT OVER THE PACT HAS </p><p>RENEWED CALLS BY THE SECTOR\'S LARGEST, MOST MILITANT </p><p>FEDERATION FOR LEGISLATION REQUIRING VERIFICATION OF UNIONS\' </p><p>ACTUAL REPRESENTATION WITHIN A SECTOR.  AT A MINIMUM, THE </p><p>PACT OFFERS AT LEAST ONE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THE PROSPECT OF </p><p>RELAXING THE RIGID NATIONAL CONTRACTS THAT HAVE STIFLED WAGE </p><p>FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, TWO FREQUENT </p><p>DRAGS ON ITALIAN COMPETITIVENESS.  MOREOVER, ITS INNOVATIVE </p><p>PROVISIONS MAY CARRY OVER AS PRECEDENTS INTO RENEGOTIATION </p><p>THIS SUMMER OF ITALY\'S GLOBAL PACT GOVERNING COLLECTIVE </p><p>BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, A PROSPECT THAT HAS THE THREE MAIN </p><p>LABOR CONFEDERATIONS WRESTLING OVER THE SHAPE OF THEIR </p><p>FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH MANAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. FEDERMECCANICA, THE METAL MANUFACTURERS\' ASSOCIATION, </p><p>SIGNED A NEW SECTORAL CONTRACT WITH TWO OF ITALY\'S THREE </p><p>PRINCIPAL METALWORKER FEDERATIONS MAY 8.  THE NEW CONTRACT </p><p>HAS BEEN HAILED AS AN INNOVATIVE DEPARTURE FROM PAST </p><p>SECTORAL AGREEMENTS.  THE SPECIFICS SUPPORT THAT ASSESSMENT, </p><p>IN THAT THE CONTRACT: </p><p> </p><p>- REPLACES RIGID WAGE INDEXATION TO GOVERNMENT INFLATION </p><p>PROJECTIONS WITH A SET OF PRE-NEGOTIATED ADJUSTMENTS DERIVED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02177  01 OF 02  161244Z </p><p>FROM CURRENT INFLATION ESTIMATES; </p><p>- CREATES A NEW LABOR-MANAGEMENT COUNCIL TO MANAGE TRAINING </p><p>AND OTHER LABOR SERVICES WITHIN THE SECTOR; </p><p> </p><p>- AUTHORIZES OVERHAUL OF A 30-YEAR POSITION CLASSIFICATION </p><p>SYSTEM, WITH THE IDEA OF ELIMINATING A RIGID 7-TIER </p><p>STRUCTURE IN FAVOR OF MORE FLEXIBLE SYSTEM OF PAY \'BANDS." </p><p> </p><p>THE CONTRACT ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT WILL PERMIT </p><p>LOCAL/REGIONAL BONUSES FOR PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES; PRIOR </p><p>CONTRACTS REQUIRED THE MAIN PORTION OF PRODUCTIVITY BONUSES </p><p>TO BE APPORTIONED NATIONALLY TO ALL SECTORAL WORKERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE PACT\'S MOST INNOVATIVE PROVISIONS </p><p>FUELED FURTHER DISCORD AMONG THE UNION CONFEDERATIONS.  THE </p><p>DEAL PROVOKED AN ANGRY REBUTTAL FROM FIOM, THE LARGEST </p><p>METALWORKERS FEDERATION (WITH SOME 30% OF ALL EMPLOYEES IN </p><p>THE SECTOR, AND OVER HALF OF UNIONIZED WORKERS, ON ITS </p><p>ROLLS).  FIOM\'S PARENT CONFEDERATION, CGIL, IS ITALY\'S </p><p>LARGEST AND MOST MILITANT TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION.  IT HAS </p><p>LONG OPPOSED ANY CHANGES TO ITALY\'S TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF </p><p>NATIONAL CONTRACTS THAT SET WAGES, BONUSES AND WORK </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR ALL WORKERS, FEARING THEY WOULD ERODE </p><p>WORKERS\' WAGES/LIVING STANDARDS AS EMPLOYERS SHOP FOR THE </p><p>LOWEST POSSIBLE LABOR COSTS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE OTHER </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS\' AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRACT NOT ONLY LEAVES </p><p>FIOM/CGIL STANDING ALONE IN PRINCIPLE; IT ALSO LEAVES THE </p><p>FEDERATION CONFRONTING A LEGALLY-BINDING CONTRACT THAT </p><p>APPLIES TO ITS MEMBERS AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4. ALTHOUGH ITALY\'S CONSTITUTION UPHOLDS THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02177  01 OF 02  161244Z </p><p>COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATIVE CONTRACTS THAT APPLY TO ALL </p><p>WORKERS IN A SECTOR, PARLIAMENT HAS NEVER ADOPTED </p><p>LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, THE JUDICIARY STANDS AS SOLE ARBITER OF WHETHER A </p><p>CONTRACT IS VALID AND "REPRESENTATIVE."  PAST RULINGS </p><p>GENERALLY HAVE DEEMED LABOR AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED </p><p>BY UNIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE MAIN CONFEDERATIONS, EVEN IF </p><p>THEY REPRESENT A MINORITY OF WORKERS, AS REPRESENTATIVE AND </p><p>APPLICABLE TO ALL WORKERS IN THE SECTOR.  FIOM/CGIL IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO EMPLOY DECIDEDLY ITALIAN TACTICS TO CONFRONT THE </p><p>"IMPOSED CONTRACT," NOISILY STRIKING TO PROTEST THE NEW </p><p>PACT\'S PROVISIONS AND THREATENING TO CHALLENGE LEGALLY ITS </p><p>APPLICABILITY WHILE ITS MEMBERS QUIETLY POCKET THE WAGE </p><p>INCREASES (WHICH IT CLAIMED WERE INADEQUATE) PROVIDED UNDER </p><p>THE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. EMPLOYERS ARE PLEASED, VIEWING THE AGREEMENT AS THE FIRST </p><p>PRACTICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE OTHER TWO UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS\' COMMITMENT TO A NEW TYPE OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT </p><p>COOPERATION.  THAT COMMITMENT WAS FIRST AGREED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, THE TWO CONFEDERATIONS AND EMPLOYERS IN LAST </p><p>SUMMER\'S "PACT FOR ITALY," A BROAD STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES </p><p>THAT FIRST SPLIT THE THREE LABOR CONFEDERATIONS (WITH CGIL </p><p>REFUSING TO SIGN AND STRIKING IN PROTEST).

EVEN AS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION SHIFTS TO NEGOTIATION OF </p><p>OTHER SECTORAL CONTRACTS, BOTH LABOR AND MANAGEMENT HAVE </p><p>THEIR GAZES FIXED FIRMLY ON RENEGOTIATION LATER THIS SUMMER </p><p>OF THE UMBRELLA ACCORD GOVERNING THE TERMS OF COLLECTIVE </p><p>BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.  THE PARTIES TO THE METALWORKERS </p><p>CONTRACT WILL WORK TO EMBED ITS PROVISIONS IN THIS UPDATED </p><p>UMBRELLA AGREEMENT; CGIL WILL TRY TO ENSURE THEY ARE </p><p>CONFINED TO THIS ONE SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE AGREEMENT WILL PROVOKE DEBATE, IF NOT MUCH MOVEMENT, </p><p>ON LONG-MORIBUND LEGISLATION TO FLESH OUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROVISION GUARANTEEING REPRESENTATIVE CONTRACTS.  FIOM/CGIL </p><p>AND LIKE-MINDED LEGISLATORS FROM THE FAR LEFT HAVE VOWED TO </p><p>PRESS FOR THE LEGISLATION\'S PASSAGE.  CISL, THE SECOND </p><p>LARGEST, "CATHOLIC" CONFEDERATION, HAS DENOUNCED THIS AS A </p><p>GAMBIT TO GIVE THE FEDERATION, ITALY\'S LARGEST, DE FACTO </p><p>VETO POWER OVER ANY FUTURE CONTRACT; IT ARGUES THAT LABOR </p><p>AND MANAGEMENT SHOULD WORK OUT A MUTUALLY-ACCEPTABLE </p><p>SOLUTION WITHOUT INVOLVING PARLIAMENT.  THE SMALLEST OF THE </p><p>THREE CONFEDERATIONS, CENTRIST UIL PRIVATELY AGREES WITH </p><p>CGIL\'S POSITION BUT IS HOLDING ITS TONGUE FOR TACTICAL </p><p>REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT:  THE METALWORKERS\' INNOVATIVE CONTRACT IS </p><p>ANOTHER SIGN THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ASPECT OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02177  02 OF 02  161244Z </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S COMPREHENSIVE REFORM PLAN WILL BE IN </p><p>THE AREA OF LABOR MARKETS (REFTEL).  IN SOME RESPECTS, </p><p>THAT\'S NOT SURPRISING, SINCE THE REFORMS TO DATE COME </p><p>LARGELY WITH SUPPORT OF MUCH OF ORGANIZED LABOR; GIVEN </p><p>ITALY\'S TRADITION AND CULTURE OF CONSENSUS DECISION-MAKING, </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT SUPPORT SHOULDN\'T BE UNDERESTIMATED. </p><p>TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT APPROACH, EMPLOYERS MAY WELL DECIDE </p><p>TO ACCEPT A MORE LIMITED SET OF THESE INNOVATIONS IN THE NEW </p><p>ACCORD GOVERNING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IN ORDER </p><p>TO SECURE CGIL\'S APPROVAL.  THE GOVERNMENT FACES A MUCH </p><p>TOUGHER TEST ON PENSION REFORM GIVEN THE CONFEDERATIONS\' </p><p>UNIFIED OPPOSITION TO MOST OF ITS PROPOSED LEGISLATION </p><p>(SEPTEL).  THE OUTCOME OF THAT DEBATE WILL GO A LONG WAY TO </p><p>DETERMINING WHETHER THE BERLUSCONI REFORM SCORECARD WILL BE </p><p>MODEST OR MEANINGFUL.  THERE\'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT CGIL\'S </p><p>PUSH FOR REPRESENTATIVE CONTACT LEGISLATION WILL AMOUNT TO </p><p>ANYTHING; SPLITS AMONG THE CONFEDERATIONS MIRROR THOSE </p><p>WITHIN THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION, AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY IS SUFFICIENT IN ANY CASE TO REJECT </p><p>AN UNWANTED BILL. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02177 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
