<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR E.MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW NEPAL PRIME MINISTER ASKS U.S. FOR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1060 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p> (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary, Madhu Raman </p><p>Acharya, convoked the Charge\' privately on June 10 under </p><p>instructions from the new Prime Minister and Acting Foreign </p><p>Minister, Surya Bahadur Thapa.  The Secretary explained the </p><p>PM\'s current efforts to persuade the major political parties </p><p>to participate a new cabinet and to request USG patience as </p><p>he pursues this politically difficult goal.  The Prime </p><p>Minister signaled that he will be naming several cabinet </p><p>officials on June 11 from his own party, but expects to be </p><p>able to add representatives from other parties in coming </p><p>weeks.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to the Foreign Secretary, Prime Minister </p><p>Thapa wanted to underscore to the USG that the King\'s decree </p><p>of June 4 appointing Thapa as PM responded to all three of </p><p>the principal demands of the major political parties at that </p><p>time.  These demands were the following: the delegation to </p><p>the new PM of full executive powers, a new cabinet appointed </p><p>by the PM in consultation with the parties, and </p><p>representation in the cabinet by all the parliamentary </p><p>parities.  Since his appointment, Thapa has paid calls on the </p><p>leaders of most of the major political parties.  Although </p><p>Thapa\'s invitations to join the new cabinet have been met so </p><p>far with refusals, the PM believes that this is just </p><p>posturing by the opposition leaders and that in fact they </p><p>have signaled some flexibility.  In addition to top leaders, </p><p>the PM has met with a number of second-echelon members of the </p><p>party central committees.  The PM reportedly believes that </p><p>some serious rethinking is going on within party </p><p>policy-making circles and is confident that the parties will </p><p>in time join his government.  In the meantime, the PM is </p><p>adhering to a policy of not alienating the parties further, </p><p>making no derogatory statements about them and not permitting </p><p>excessive use of force against party demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the afternoon of June 11, Acharya said, the PM will </p><p>announce his choices for ministers for a very small cabinet. </p><p>Some 3-5 members of the PM\'s own National Democratic Party </p><p>(RPP) will be chosen to run the government "for the time </p><p>being."  PM Thapa intends to "keep the door open" for further </p><p>appointments, and will reserve the right to shift portfolios </p><p>as new ministers are added.  The PM\'s political priorities </p><p>will be to pursue peace negotiations with the Maoists to a </p><p>successful conclusion, hold parliamentary and local-level </p><p>elections, maintain continuity in Nepal\'s foreign policy, </p><p>fight corruption and strengthen governance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Foreign Secretary enumerated a number of ways in </p><p>which Nepal\'s political environment allegedly had improved </p><p>since Thapa\'s appointment on June 4.  The parties, he </p><p>asserted, have become reconciled to the fact that the new </p><p>prime minister is another monarchical appointee rather than </p><p>the candidate of their choice.  The party leaders, he also </p><p>claimed, realize that their street agitations are not </p><p>generating popular support nor going anywhere politically. </p><p>Some Nepali Congress leaders, Acharya said, already </p><p>acknowledge that PM Thapa is an improvement over his </p><p>predecessor.  One advantage that Thapa enjoys that was not </p><p>true of his predecessor is the full support of his own party. </p><p> Of the opposition parties\' main current demands--the </p><p>announcement of a date for elections or the reinstatement of </p><p>the House of Representatives--the Maoists would not permit </p><p>elections.  Acharya would not comment on the prospects for </p><p>the resuscitating Parliament.  Speaking for himself, the </p><p>Secretary said, he suspected that some of the political </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>parties would not join the Thapa government but would support </p><p>it from outside.  In conclusion, Acharya said, the Prime </p><p>Minister asked for patience from the USG, since it would take </p><p>time for the changed political situation to clarify. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment.  The new Prime Minister\'s private message to </p><p>the USG was clearly self-serving and not particularly </p><p>revealing, since rumors of his impending cabinet appointments </p><p>have featured widely in the press.  It is hard for us to be </p><p>as sanguine as the Prime Minister claims to be about his </p><p>ultimate success in drawing the main parties into his </p><p>government although Kathmandu is rife with rumors that the </p><p>Nepali Congress will join after a few weeks (reftel).  The </p><p>PM\'s message is, however, indicative of his energetic and </p><p>skillful handling of potential political allies and, in this </p><p>case, an important foreign donor. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
