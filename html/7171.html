<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002083 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: ANOTHER WEEKEND OF PEACEFUL COUNTRYWIDE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1867 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1872 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1875 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 1883 </p><p>     E. AMMAN 1905 </p><p>     F. AMMAN 1928 </p><p>     G. AMMAN 2044 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Thousands demonstrate peacefully against Iraq war </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Several demonstrations ranging in the hundreds to the </p><p>low thousands again took place throughout Jordan after Friday </p><p>prayers on April 4.  Press reports said the continuation of </p><p>images of the destruction and civilian Iraqi deaths on </p><p>Jordanians\' television screens motivates the demonstrators. </p><p>Jordanian demonstrators again hoisted pictures of Saddam </p><p>alongside Iraqi flags while chanting "Death to America", </p><p>"Bush, what do you want from us?", "Why don\'t you take your </p><p>dogs and leave the region?", "Down with Bush the liar!", </p><p>"America get out! Iraq will remain Arab and free!".  At the </p><p>Wihdat Palestinian refugee camp, the perceived </p><p>ineffectiveness of Arab leaders in preventing the war </p><p>prompted some demonstrators to chant, "You sold Baghdad for a </p><p>dollar!", "You sold Jerusalem for a dollar!".  US, UK and </p><p>Israeli flags were burned and paraded on the back of a </p><p>donkey. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Arab leaders share the blame </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While many blame the US and UK for the misery and </p><p>destruction in Iraq, Abdul Majid Dandis, spokesperson for an </p><p>opposition bloc that demonstrated in Amman pointed the finger </p><p>at Arab countries that had facilitated the US led war by </p><p>providing access to their military bases.  Demonstrators also </p><p>condemned the coalition for its "crusade" against the region </p><p>and Arab leaders for not taking a firm stand against the </p><p>invasion of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>PM\'s Protest to US Ambassador Praised </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Prominent Jordanian figures praised the government\'s </p><p>summoning of the US Ambassador to protest the US aggression </p><p>in Iraq. (Ref Amman 2029 and Amman 2035)  Such figures </p><p>included Sa\'d Hayil al-Surur, former speaker of the House of </p><p>Representatives, Marwan Dudin, moderator of the foreign </p><p>affairs committee in the Upper House and Dr. Mamduh </p><p>al-Abbadi, a former health minister and prominent political </p><p>figure.  Surur praised the government for its strong anti-war </p><p>stance and defended it against "those who practice </p><p>one-upmanship against the Jordanian position that this </p><p>position is ahead of all the Arab positions.  Surur also said </p><p>that the PM\'s action symbolized a "translation of the </p><p>feelings of all Jordanians and the Jordanian homeland." </p><p>Dudin concurred saying, "the protest of all Jordanians had to </p><p>be conveyed to the US Administration at the highest possible </p><p>level in order to enable the Jordanian position to have an </p><p>impact.  We hope that the Arab capitals that have a one-party </p><p>rule would follow Jordan\'s example."  Dudin further added, </p><p>"although we are eager to maintain good relations with the </p><p>world\'s superpower, this does not at all mean we cannot raise </p><p>our voices denouncing the ugly inhuman actions that started </p><p>from the first days of the invasion and which shocks the </p><p>conscience of all Jordanians." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) At a meeting PolOff attended with Jamal Rifai, a </p><p>Jordanian columnist, Rifai said that he was worried of the </p><p>war lasting more than a month.  If this happens he fears the </p><p>US military might lose its patience and start bombing </p><p>indiscriminately killing hundreds of innocent Iraqi </p><p>civilians.  Were this to happen he fears Jordanians might be </p><p>less inclined to conduct legal, peaceful rallies. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Jordanians again demonstrated their support of the </p><p>Iraqi people and anger at civilian casualties in a largely </p><p>controlled, organized and non-violent way.  The GOJ continues </p><p>to work with rally organizers to ensure that Jordanians </p><p>continue to let off steam according to the law. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
