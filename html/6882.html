<p>UNCLAS HALIFAX 0093 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR CA/OCS, WHA/CAN, AND EB/TRAN </p><p>USDOT PLEASE PASS NTSB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, EAIR, CA, US, Transportation </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD </p><p>RELEASES FINAL REPORT ON CRASH OF SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. THE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD OF CANADA (TSB) TODAY RELEASED </p><p>ITS FINAL REPORT ON SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111, WHICH CRASHED OFF THE </p><p>COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA ON SEPTEMBER 2, 1998, KILLING ALL ABOARD, </p><p>INCLUDING 103 AMERICAN CITIZENS.  THIS REPORT MARKS THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE TSB\'S LONGEST AND MOST EXTENSIVE CRASH </p><p>INVESTIGATION EVER, CONDUCTED AT A TOTAL COST OF C$ 57 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE ONBOARD FIRE WHICH LED TO THE CRASH </p><p>OF SWISSAIR 111 STARTED IN A HIDDEN OVERHEAD AREA ON THE </p><p>STARBOARD SIDE OF THE PLANE JUST ABOVE AND AT THE REAR OF THE </p><p>COCKPIT AREA.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS AN ARCING EVENT IN THE </p><p>AIRCRAFT\'S ELECTRICAL WIRING.   THE TSB PINPOINTED ONE PARTICULAR </p><p>SECTION OF WIRING FROM THE AIRCRAFT\'S IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT </p><p>SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS CLASS PASSENGERS AS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>INITIAL ARCING EVENT, THOUGH THEY COULD NOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY </p><p>THAT THE ARCING THAT OCCURRED THERE WAS IN FACT THE LEAD EVENT. </p><p>THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT ARCING ALSO OCCURRED AT OTHER POINTS IN </p><p>THE WIRING FOR THE IN FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WHICH WERE NOT </p><p>RECOVERED, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ISOLATE THE LEAD ARCING EVENT. </p><p>THIS ARCING IGNITED THE METALLIZED POLYETHELENE TEREPHTHALATE </p><p>(MPET) MATERIAL ON THE INSULATION BLANKETS ABOVE THE CEILING OF </p><p>THE RIGHT REAR COCKPIT AREA.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE MPET </p><p>BLANKETS WERE EXCESSIVELY FLAMMABLE AND THAT ABSENT THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF FLAMMABLE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OF THE INITIAL ARCING </p><p>EVENT, THE DISASTER WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE TSB NOTED THAT FIRE/SMOKE DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION </p><p>DEVISES WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE AREA WHERE THE FIRE STARTED, AND </p><p>WERE NOT REQUIRED AT THAT TIME.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE </p><p>FLIGHT CREW DID NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY TOOLS, PROCEDURES, OR </p><p>TRAINING TO LOCATE AND ELIMINATE THE FIRE BEFORE IT BECAME </p><p>UNCONTROLLABLE.  THE TSB ALSO CONCLUDED THAT AIR CIRCULATION </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT VENTED SMOKE AWAY FROM THE </p><p>CREW INITIALLY.  THIS CONTRIBUTED TO A DELAY IN RECOGNIZING THE </p><p>EXTREMELY SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SITUATION, AND LED THEM INITIALLY </p><p>TO ERRONEOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE SMELL THEY DETECTED WAS THE </p><p>RESULT OF AN ANOMALY IN THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM INSTEAD OF AN </p><p>ONBOARD FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>4. HOWEVER, THE TSB ALSO CONCLUDED THAT AN ACCURATE EARLY </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION WOULD STILL NOT HAVE GIVEN THE CREW </p><p>OF SWISSAIR 111 SUFFICIENT TIME TO EXECUTE A SAFE EMERGENCY </p><p>LANDING IN HALIFAX.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT, GIVEN IDEAL </p><p>CONDITIONS, THE EARLIEST MOMENT THAT SWISSAIR 111 COULD HAVE </p><p>LANDED WAS 22:27 LOCAL TIME.  HOWEVER, THE ONBOARD FIRE RESULTED </p><p>IN A RAPID DETERIORATION OF FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS IN THE COCKPIT </p><p>AT 22:25.  THE TSB THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE CREW WOULD HAVE </p><p>LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT SHORT OF THE RUNWAY EVEN IF THEY HAD </p><p>ACTED IMMEDIATELY TO EXECUTE AN EMERGENCY LANDING AT THE MOMENT </p><p>THEY FIRST SMELLED SMOKE. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN ADDITION TO THE 14 AVIATION SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS ALREADY </p><p>MADE IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THE TSB RELEASED AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL NINE RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR FINAL </p><p>REPORT.  THESE RECOMMENDATIONS DEAL WITH TESTING AND FLAMMABILITY </p><p>STANDARDS FOR INSULATION MATERIALS, WITH AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL </p><p>SYSTEMS INCLUDING CERTIFICATION OF ADD-ON ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS FOR </p><p>COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAPTURE AND STORAGE </p><p>OF IN FLIGHT DATA. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE TSB OFFICIALS PRESENT EMPHASIZED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THEIR </p><p>INVESTIGATION IS TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY AND TO PREVENT FUTURE </p><p>TRAGEDIES, NOT TO ASSIGN BLAME OR LIABILITY FOR THE CRASH OF </p><p>SWISSAIR 111.  THEY EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THEIR INVESTIGATION HAVE AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY.  WHETHER THE INFORMATION IN </p><p>THEIR FINAL REPORT WILL PROVIDE ANY MEASURE OF CLOSURE OR </p><p>SATISFACTION FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF SWISSAIR REMAINS </p><p>TO BE SEEN.  THE TSB REPORT IS AVAILABLE IN FULL AT: </p><p>HTTP//WWW.TSB.GC.CA. </p><p> </p><p>SEIBEL </p><p></p></div>
