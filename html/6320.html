Ambassador Wills\' 3/11 visit to Jaffna (see reftel) was </p><p>noted in segments of the English and Sinhala press, and </p><p>garnered substantial and positive coverage in the Tamil </p><p>press. </p><p> </p><p>2. English and Sinhala dailies.  Under the front-page </p><p>headline "Wills says \'peace at hand\'" the DAILY MIRROR </p><p>(independent English daily) said:  "U.S. Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills yesterday urged the Jaffna People to be calm and </p><p>patient till next year to witness lasting peace and </p><p>economic growth.  The ambassador made this appeal when he </p><p>met officials of local NGOs.  Mr. Wills was also scheduled </p><p>to meet Jaffna military commander Sarath Fonseka to discuss </p><p>the issue of High Security Zones."  Similar coverage </p><p>appeared on the front page of DINAMINA (government-owned </p><p>Sinhala daily) under the headline "\'Dawn of peace is </p><p>certain; people in the North should wait patiently\' -- </p><p>American Ambassador says in Jaffna."  Excerpts:  "... Wills </p><p>said that Sri Lanka would have eternal peace through the </p><p>current peace process....  He expressed this view at a </p><p>conference [attended by] Jaffna MPs and NGO officials.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that peace that would be ushered in before </p><p>the end of this year ... and that the country would then </p><p>reap more of the benefits of peace."  DINAMINA noted that </p><p>other issues discussed included "creating a conducive </p><p>environment for civilians to resettle in the HSZs, fishing </p><p>activities, and farmers\' and media issues...." </p><p> </p><p>3. Tamil coverage.  Understandably, coverage was heaviest </p><p>in the Tamil press.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>- SUDAR OLI (independent Tamil daily):  At the meeting MPs </p><p>and other representatives explained to him the living </p><p>standards of the Jaffna people, HSZs issues, and problems </p><p>surrounding the resettlement of IDPs.  "Although one year </p><p>has passed since the signing of the MOU, normalcy has not </p><p>returned to Jaffna and its people," [local leaders] said. </p><p>They also said that "fishermen are affected very badly. </p><p>Our golden lands have been turned into HSZs and our people </p><p>are denied their resettlement and farming rights....  When </p><p>the guns are silent are these HSZs necessary?" </p><p> </p><p>In reply, the Ambassador said:  "Government is facing </p><p>problems in resettlement.  I am telling you that the HSZs </p><p>will be removed step by step and the displaced will be </p><p>resettled.  Therefore the people should be a bit patient. </p><p> </p><p>- THINAKURAL (independent Tamil daily):  ... Wills said as </p><p>the peace talks between the Government and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers progress, HSZs will be removed, normalcy will </p><p>return, and people will begin to resettle.  He further </p><p>stated:  "Permanent peace will return only if the Tamil </p><p>people of the North and East are patient.  It is impossible </p><p>to find an immediate solution to a problem that has existed </p><p>for 20 years.  This can only be achieved step by step.  For </p><p>this the government and the Liberation Tigers should work </p><p>together." </p><p> </p><p>- THINAKARAN (government-owned Tamil daily):  "There is </p><p>fervent hope that Sri Lanka will achieve lasting peace -- </p><p>People of Jaffna should be patient" said Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills....  He also said that the people should see more </p><p>benefits in the second year of the ceasefire agreement." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
