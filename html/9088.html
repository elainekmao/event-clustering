<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001146 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: ENSURING SRI LANKA UNDERSTANDS OUR FTA STANDARDS </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 188657 </p><p> </p><p>1. Charge met with Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs </p><p>Ravi Karunanayake on July 1, during a call on the Minister </p><p>by US Reps Jerry Weller and Scott Garrett, both in Sri Lanka </p><p>on a private visit.  Charge used the meeting to encourage </p><p>the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) to study the texts of the </p><p>FTAs the US recently signed with Singapore and Chile, as </p><p>requested in reftel.  The US, Charge noted, sees the </p><p>Singapore and Chile texts as good templates for any future </p><p>FTAs the US might enter into. </p><p> </p><p>2. Karunanayake said that GSL had already looked at the text </p><p>of both FTAs and would study them further.  Charge pressed </p><p>Karunanayake for GSL to go through these FTAs, clause by </p><p>clause, and assess where Sri Lanka stood in meeting each </p><p>requirement.  Charge also told Karunanayake that GSL should </p><p>not get ahead of itself; it was important to maintain focus </p><p>on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) </p><p>process, which the US sees as a necessary step toward </p><p>enhancing bilateral trade ties. </p><p> </p><p>3. Earlier, before receiving reftel, Charge spoke to Ken </p><p>Balendra, a leading Sri Lankan businessman whom GSL has </p><p>tapped as head of an inter-agency task force to prepare for </p><p>a US-Sri Lankan FTA.  Balendra said he and his staff had </p><p>indeed looked at the Singapore and Chile FTAs.  Charge </p><p>pointed out that an FTA negotiation with the US would be </p><p>lengthy and require some tough decisions on Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>part.  Sri Lankan Embassy Commercial Counselor Udagedara </p><p>joined the conversation to say that he hoped the text of a </p><p>US-Morocco FTA (once negotiated) could also be used as a </p><p>model for Sri Lanka, since "development arguments" were </p><p>being used with Morocco in a way not relevant to more </p><p>advanced economies like Singapore and Chile. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Expectations for the prospect of a US-Sri Lankan FTA are </p><p>high in trade circles here.  Visiting US Reps Weller and </p><p>Garrett have heard of Sri Lanka\'s enthusiasm for an US FTA </p><p>in meetings with the several GSL Ministers, including the </p><p>Prime Minister, and various business groups.  GSL </p><p>understands we only do "gold-standard" FTAs; detailed study </p><p>of the Singapore and Chile agreements will show them just </p><p>how high our standards are.  As the TIFA process moves </p><p>forward, post is committed to leveraging Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>enthusiasm for an FTA into the commitments on further </p><p>economic liberalization needed to prove it is indeed ready </p><p>to be our free trade partner. </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
