<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000340 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS PAMPHLETEER, PREPARE FOR STRIKE IN </p><p>CAPITAL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) KATHMANDU 0333; (B) KATHMANDU 0278 </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Maoist insurgents continue to publicize a </p><p>nationwide strike called for Feb. 22-23 in commemoration </p><p>of the seventh anniversary of the insurgency and had </p><p>some success enforcing a local strike in the mid-western </p><p>and western regions Feb. 10.  Security forces have </p><p>increased checkpoints along city streets and major </p><p>arteries into the capital in response to reports that </p><p>Maoist activists plan to infiltrate Kathmandu in the run- </p><p>up to the strike.  A small improvised bomb exploded at a </p><p>tax office located about one kilometer from the U.S. </p><p>Embassy Feb. 11, slightly injuring three people inside </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON) facility.  Air service to </p><p>and from Lukla, which serves travelers heading for the </p><p>Everest Base Camp, was restored Feb. 11.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PAMPHLETS AND POSTERS </p><p>IN CAPITAL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Maoist activists continue to publicize the </p><p>upcoming nationwide strike, or bandh, called for Feb. 22- </p><p>23 (Ref B) in commemoration of the seventh anniversary </p><p>of the insurgency--including in Kathmandu.  Pamphlets </p><p>and posters promoting adherence to the bandh have been </p><p>observed along several major thoroughfares in the </p><p>capital, and at least one activist postering a city wall </p><p>was reportedly shot and injured by police the night of </p><p>Feb. 11. Security forces have increased checkpoints </p><p>along city streets and major arteries into the capital </p><p>in response to reports that Maoist activists plan to </p><p>infiltrate Kathmandu in the run-up to the strike. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A pamphlet distributed by the Maoist-affiliated </p><p>All Nepal Independent Student Union (Revolutionary) in </p><p>Kathmandu Feb. 10 called for residents to observe the </p><p>strike to protest the "martial law" perpetrated on the </p><p>population by the King and Prime Minister.  Besides </p><p>calling for an end to the state of emergency and anti- </p><p>terrorism ordinances, the flyer also demands the </p><p>dissolution of the Constitution and current government; </p><p>the institution of "revolutionary land reforms"; an end </p><p>to gender- and caste-based discrimination; and a halt to </p><p>the "interference of imperialists and expansionists" </p><p>(which typically refers, in standard Maoist demonology, </p><p>to the U.S. and India respectively). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>STRIKE OBSERVED IN WEST </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Maoists experienced some success in locally </p><p>enforcing a strike called for the mid-western--long </p><p>regarded the insurgents\' strongest base--and western </p><p>regions Feb. 10.  Public transportation reportedly </p><p>ground to a halt on all major highways in the region for </p><p>the day; a bus and two trucks traveling to Surkhet in </p><p>defiance of the ban were set on fire.  The day before </p><p>insurgents destroyed a District Development Committee </p><p>Office and the home of a former State Minister in </p><p>Bardiya District in the west. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>KATHMANDU TAX OFFICE HIT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In the late morning of Feb. 11 a small </p><p>improvised device exploded in a bathroom of an Inland </p><p>Revenue Office in the capital, approximately one </p><p>kilometer from the U.S. Embassy and less than half a </p><p>kilometer from the French Embassy.  Three local </p><p>employees of the tax office were slightly injured. </p><p>Although no one has yet claimed responsibility for the </p><p>bombing, police suspect Maoist involvement. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LUKLA AIRPORT BACK IN BUSINESS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Air service to and from Lukla Airport, which had </p><p>been suspended as of Feb. 2 (Ref B), resumed Feb. 10 </p><p>after the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) sent reinforcements to </p><p>guard the facility.  RNA helicopters evacuated foreign </p><p>tourists, including two American citizens, who had been </p><p>stranded in Lukla, the major entry point for travelers </p><p>to Mt. Everest Base Camp, the previous week. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  A December 7 bandh called by the insurgents </p><p>during the state of emergency went generally unobserved </p><p>in the capital, and the Maoists apparently are trying to </p><p>ensure that the Feb. 22-23 strike is not a similar bust. </p><p>In previous years, commemoration of the February </p><p>anniversary of the insurgency typically kicks off the </p><p>start of increased dry-season activity for the Maoists. </p><p>This year, the anniversary coincides with Parliamentary </p><p>debate on the success of the emergency in controlling </p><p>the insurgency (Ref A), raising the stakes for both the </p><p>Maoists and the GON to demonstrate who has the upper </p><p>hand. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
