<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISTANBUL 000698 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: MINORITY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN TURKEY: A </p><p>QUESTION OF APPROACH ON PROPERTY ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ISTANBUL 202 (B) 2002 ISTANBUL 1627 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and ( </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Recent legal changes in property rights for </p><p>minority foundations have elicited varied responses from </p><p>different religious communities in Turkey.  The history of </p><p>Turkish and Ottoman minority communities plays into their </p><p>respective views on pastoral concerns, political connections, </p><p>property issues, and outside audiences.  Each community\'s </p><p>pragmatic calculation of its own best interest accounts for </p><p>differences in minority community relations with the Turkish </p><p>Government.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>The Unbending Greek Position </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ecumenical Patriarch has the difficult task of </p><p>occupying the universally acknowledged, but often </p><p>disregarded, Patriarchal throne of Constantinople and New </p><p>Rome, recognized as ecumenical outside Turkey, but deprecated </p><p>by the Turkish state.  First among the Patriarchs of all </p><p>Orthodoxy, his pastoral duties include ministering to </p><p>millions of diaspora Greeks in the United States (as well as </p><p>other countries), and a tiny group (around 3,000) of aging </p><p>Greeks in Istanbul.  His flock, which at the turn of the </p><p>twentieth century numbered over 500,000 in Istanbul alone </p><p>(and millions throughout Turkey), once owned vast areas in </p><p>and around Istanbul, including all of Heybeliada, the island </p><p>which still houses Halki Seminary, currently not permitted to </p><p>function by the Turkish State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Given the small size of the Greek Orthodox community </p><p>in Turkey, the Ecumenical Patriarch is not heavily encumbered </p><p>with local pastoral obligations.  American Greeks, from whom </p><p>he derives much respect, outside support, and funding, </p><p>encourage him to remain firm in his insistence on (1) </p><p>recognition from the Turkish State of his ecumenical status; </p><p>and (2) reopening Halki Seminary.  In a recent submission of </p><p>lost property to the General Directorate for Foundations, </p><p>Metropolitan Meliton said the Patriarchate submitted claims </p><p>for 1,374 disputed properties (other sources say they </p><p>submitted close to 2,000).  In contrast, Armenians submitted </p><p>less than 400, Jews four, and Chaldeans three. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) NOTE: Radikal newspaper reported May 5 that 1593 </p><p>applications have been submitted to the General Directorate </p><p>for Foundations so far.  Of those, 574 (or 36 percent) of the </p><p>applications were rejected.  Of those property claims </p><p>rejected, 302 were Greek, 232 Armenian (the article does not </p><p>differentiate between Armenian Catholic and Orthodox claims), </p><p>and 13 Jewish.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Additionally, the Ecumenical Patriachate is </p><p>considerably less concerned with angering the GoT by voicing </p><p>objections to outsiders than the Jews or Armenians.  After </p><p>the First World War, Greeks transferred some community </p><p>properties into the names of private individuals in order to </p><p>avoid expropriation.  The door, however, was closed behind </p><p>them.  Until the most recent spate of legal reforms, a </p><p>religious community could not make use of these </p><p>nominally-private properties.  In one case, an orphanage was </p><p>tranferred into private hands but could not be further used </p><p>by the community.  Additionally, Turkish law forbade the </p><p>religious minority communities from gaining property through </p><p>inheritance, except under special circumstances as determined </p><p>by the General Directorate for Foundations.  To the knowledge </p><p>of ConGen Istanbul, no community has ever received permission </p><p>to gain property by inheritance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) With these memories still haunting the Patriarch and </p><p>his supporters, post believes an unwritten decision was taken </p><p>not to pursue any legal loopholes in the future.  Rather, the </p><p>Patriarchate has consistently pressed for explicit legal </p><p>recognition of their various property claims (reftel).  To </p><p>date, this has not borne fruit.  However, with a </p><p>steadily-shrinking local community and a supportive overseas </p><p>flock, the Ecumenical Patriarch has considerably less to lose </p><p>than other religious minorities in confronting the GoT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Flexible Jewish Policies </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Jewish community in Turkey numbers approximately </p><p>25,000 people, the vast majority of whom are in Istanbul. </p><p>The community maintains property primarily on the European </p><p>side of the city, with a synagogue and other properties also </p><p>on Buyukada (an island in the Sea of Marmara).  Despite the </p><p>community\'s size, few legal problems exist, largely due to </p><p>the flexible approach the community has taken in maintaining </p><p>its properties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) First, the community tranfers ownership when necessary </p><p>to avoid expropriation or other loss.  While the Chief </p><p>Rabbinate has had a historically close relationship with U.S. </p><p>and Israeli diplomats, it avoids adversarial relations with </p><p>the Turkish Government.  The community avoids formalisti=QQdealing with </p><p>he General Directorate for Foundations (which </p><p>all communities assess is not favorably disposed to Jewish or </p><p>Christian needs to begin with), opting instead to approach </p><p>elected officials who can bring pressure on the General </p><p>Directorate\'s bureaucrats from above.  Poloff pointed out to </p><p>Chief Rabbinate\'s Lay Vice President Lina Filiba that the </p><p>community has a history of finding a modus vivendi within </p><p>Turkish law ("and sometimes outside it," she said) to achieve </p><p>their goals, while other communities were less flexible. </p><p>Filiba said that meeting the spiritual needs of their </p><p>community come first, and the means by which this is </p><p>accomplished are less important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Unlike the Greeks, the Jewish Community has a younger </p><p>generation as well as a series of wealthy entrepreneurs who </p><p>can assist when financial problems come up.  Jak Kamhi </p><p>(Chairman of Profilo Holding), the Garih and Alaton families </p><p>(founders of Alarko Holding), and others can be depended upon </p><p>to assist when necessary.  Thus, fighting tooth-and-nail for </p><p>one or two small properties that can bring little monetary </p><p>compensation at a significant political cost is not their </p><p>normal practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Tending the Armenian Flock </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Patriarch Mesrob II finds himself in a delicate </p><p>position: as head of the Armenian Orthodox community in </p><p>Turkey, he must tend to the needs of his sizeable community </p><p>(estimated at 65,000 to 70,000 people, now the largest of the </p><p>Lausanne Treaty minorities) by working with the Turkish </p><p>Government on practical matters such as minority education </p><p>policy, church maintenance, and reconstruction of the </p><p>patriarchate building.  At the same time, his working </p><p>relationship with the GoT often comes under criticism from </p><p>the Armenian Orthodox Church and the sizeable Armenian </p><p>diaspora in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.  Reflecting on </p><p>the question of whether the tragic events that befell </p><p>Armenians in the closing days of the Ottoman Empire should be </p><p>called a "genocide" or not, Mesrob has said that the more </p><p>important work is to focus community energy on healing, </p><p>building bridges between Turks and Armenians, and moving </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Mesrob has elected to work publicly with the </p><p>Government of Turkey.  He was the only Patriarch to travel to </p><p>Copenhagen to voice support for Turkey\'s EU aspirations in </p><p>the run-up to the most recent accessions.  Publicly voicing </p><p>pride in his Turkish citizenship, Mesrob has sought to </p><p>consolidate the position of his community by adopting a </p><p>non-threatening approach.  Recently, when asked by poloff </p><p>what concerns he had about property issues, Mesrob said that </p><p>while there were some continuing concerns, the Armenian </p><p>Orthodox community had no intention of airing the problems </p><p>publicly, or relying on outside assistance.  However, the </p><p>Patriarch and others have leveled complaints about property </p><p>issues and complications in working with the General </p><p>Directorate for Foundations; these complaints are similar to </p><p>those of other communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Criticism of GoT policies is balanced with pragmatic </p><p>interest in cooperation to improve Armenian community </p><p>cohesion.  For example, in a recent discussion with poloff, </p><p>Armenian Patriarchal Chancellor Tatul said the community </p><p>remains interested in recent mother-tongue language laws, and </p><p>is considering an Armenian-language radio station (if </p><p>forthcoming regulations permit) in addition to their </p><p>community newspaper, "Lraper." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Unrecognized Suriyanis </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Like other sizeable minority communities in Turkey, </p><p>the Syrian Orthodox were offered Lausanne Treaty status as </p><p>minorities.  Reflecting a spirit of patriotism toward the </p><p>fledgling Turkish Republic, the Patriarch (then seated in </p><p>Antakya, biblical Antioch) said that Suriyanis were Turkish </p><p>citizens, and had no need of minority status, as the </p><p>constitution would ensure their rights to freedom of </p><p>religion.  Though both the Suriyanis and the GoT may have </p><p>meant well, this left the community in limbo: not protected </p><p>by Lausanne, not Muslim, and not foreign nationals.  As such, </p><p>there is effectively no protection for the Syrian Orthodox </p><p>Church. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) In the years since Lausanne, much Suriyani church </p><p>property was expropriated by the GoT.  The Tur Abdin area of </p><p>Southeast Turkey, once home to a huge Suriyani community that </p><p>emigrated starting in the 1960\'s owing to hostility on the </p><p>part of Turkish officials, now has a series of abandoned </p><p>monasteries and churches where property ownership is in </p><p>question; perhaps only 400 Suriyanis remain in Tur Abdin. </p><p>The Patriarch eventually left Turkey for Damascus, leaving </p><p>behind two Metropolitans (effectively Archbishops), in </p><p>Istanbul and Midyat, to serve the still-sizeable community. </p><p>Both Metropolitans show great appreciation for any attention </p><p>paid to their community and its plight.  Seeing the problems </p><p>that resulted from an effective non-status for many years, </p><p>they quickly recount the past occasions on which foreign </p><p>dignitaries and Turkish officials paid them a visit, or even </p><p>sent letters of congratulations on religious holidays.  In </p><p>Istanbul, Metropolitan Yusuf Cetin speaks with admiration for </p><p>President Sezer\'s willingness to visit their church two years </p><p>ago (the only President of Turkey to do so). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Regarding property issues, the Suriyanis claim that </p><p>much of what has happened in the past is now beyond the scope </p><p>of the current law.  Key monsteries and churches remain in </p><p>their possession, yet abandoned or expropriated ones have no </p><p>congregants.  Migrations to Syria, Europe and the U.S., and </p><p>Istanbul have emptied much of their population from the </p><p>Southeast.  Midyat Metropolitan Samuel Aktas says that core </p><p>concerns of the community are largely met--worship, Aramaic </p><p>classes, and continued functioning of monasteries.  However, </p><p>when the Suriyanis need to deal with the GoT, they are </p><p>usually given unwritten approval for requests.  Such tacit </p><p>(versus official) acceptance reflects the Suriyanis\' </p><p>still-unclear status under Turkish law. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
