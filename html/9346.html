<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA (BUCKLEY), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ, JULY 11, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/11 entitled "The situation in Iraq and our soldiers". "The </p><p>death of three American soldiers yesterday confirms that the </p><p>Iraqi resistance against the invasion is getting stronger, </p><p>increasing the insecurity for foreign troops and the concern for </p><p>Washington and London. This concern should also be shared by the </p><p>Third World countries sending troops to Iraq, like Honduras." </p><p> </p><p>"Beyond the moral and legal implications of contributing to the </p><p>occupation of a sovereign territory after a war that wasn\'t </p><p>approved by the U.N., sending our soldiers to Iraq considering </p><p>the current circumstances is exposing those fellow countrymen to </p><p>an unnecessary risk, backing a cause that it is far from being </p><p>fair or humanitarian." </p><p> </p><p>"Even accepting that we obviously depend on the world\'s </p><p>superpower and that our governments are extremely willing to </p><p>fulfill the wishes of Uncle Sam, even those that go against </p><p>international law, this time we should wait that a civil </p><p>government takes over in Iraq and the U.N. organizes a real </p><p>pacification force before sending our troops. This will calm down </p><p>the Iraqi resistance and provide the moral and legal </p><p>justification to send our soldiers. Meanwhile, let the British </p><p>and Americans pay the price of the invasion." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
