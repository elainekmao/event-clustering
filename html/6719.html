<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001774 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TFIZ01 FOR EB ACTION OFFICER </p><p>E STAFF FOR SECOR </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA--MILLS, CHANG, SIMPSON </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDAN FREEZE OF IRAQI ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 74249 B) AMMAN 1620 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM DOUG SILLIMAN, REASONS 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) officials have </p><p>frozen Government of Iraq (GOI) assets in Jordanian banks </p><p>pending resolution of the conflict in Iraq, and, in addition, </p><p>are keeping a watchful eye on the Jordanian operations of the </p><p>GOI-owned Rafidain Bank.  Banking sector exposure to Oil for </p><p>Food (OFF) letters of credit continues to be high, and Jordan </p><p>hopes an alternative delivery point for OFF goods can be </p><p>established with the help of the UN (REF B).  The Central </p><p>Bank also reports normal business transpiring for the banking </p><p>sector in the first few days of the war.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GOI FUNDS BELONG TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CBJ Deputy Governor Mohammed Said Shahin confirmed </p><p>March 24 that the Bank issued a confidential memo March 20 </p><p>directing Jordanian banks to freeze all GOI accounts until </p><p>further notice.  The memo was coordinated with Prime Minister </p><p>Abul Ragheb and the General Intelligence Directorate (GID). </p><p>Shahin said he called the general managers of each bank to </p><p>personally pass along Governor Toukan\'s instructions and to </p><p>enjoin them to "keep the memo secret."  He said that he </p><p>followed up with another call to bank officials March 23, </p><p>asking them to call him immediately "with any fishy matters" </p><p>that would suggest withdrawals from other accounts on the </p><p>part of GOI officials.  In line with the points in REF A, </p><p>Shahin emphasized to bankers that it was "in Jordan\'s </p><p>national interest to safeguard the funds for the Iraqi </p><p>people.  It belongs to them, not to Saddam and his </p><p>entourage." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Shahin stressed to us that while it had the full </p><p>support of the Jordanian government, this was a very </p><p>sensitive matter for the GOJ.  Thus, the Bank was not making </p><p>a public announcement of this action. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Shahin also said the CBJ was keeping "a close eye" on </p><p>the Amman branch of the GOI-owned Rafidain Bank, the only </p><p>Iraqi bank with branches outside of Iraq.  He said the branch </p><p>maintains accounts in Jordanian banks on behalf of the GOI </p><p>and its front companies.  Shahin told us the CBJ is allowing </p><p>Rafidain to transfer funds from one Jordanian bank to </p><p>another, but that it cannot move money outside of the system. </p><p> He hoped that a post-Saddam Rafidain Bank would be </p><p>"energized" to facilitate international commerce and trade </p><p>for a normal Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>OFF EXPOSURE: STILL HIGH </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Shahin said the Central Bank of Iraq had no accounts </p><p>with the CBJ and that the only relationship between the two </p><p>was through the implementation of the bilateral oil for goods </p><p>barter protocol.  He added that recent protocol trade was </p><p>"not what it used to be."  He said that the CBJ worked </p><p>diligently with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the </p><p>Customs Directorate to ensure proper valuation of protocol </p><p>shipments, as over-valuation had been a problem. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In a separate conversation, CBJ Director of Banking </p><p>Supervision Mai Khamis estimated current exposure of the </p><p>Jordanian banking sector to UN-authorized exports to Iraq </p><p>under the OFF program at about $250 million.  She said she </p><p>had no breakdown on how much of that exposure was related to </p><p>trade currently held up by the conflict.  She requested </p><p>Embassy assistance in determining the status of a GOJ request </p><p>of the UN to permit OFF deliveries to the Port of Aqaba and </p><p>stationing of a Cotechna team in Jordan pending resolution of </p><p>hostilities (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BANKS REPORT BUSINESS AS USUAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Shahin said the CBJ was monitoring bank activity </p><p>daily and that bank business had been normal since the war </p><p>began.  He said Jordanian banks had not faced problems </p><p>clearing international transactions, attributing this to the </p><p>high capital adequacy level of Jordanian banks, currently </p><p>around 20% on average.  Shahin added that the sector has </p><p>approximately $4.7 billion in foreign currency deposits </p><p>abroad, which also made foreign banks comfortable dealing </p><p>with Jordanian counterparts.  Shahin said the Bank had </p><p>brought cash into the country earlier this month in case it </p><p>was needed to meet customer demand for banknotes. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) There continue to be no reports of unusual demands </p><p>for foreign currencies or of efforts to transfer funds </p><p>outside of Jordan.  Healthy bank capitalization and strong </p><p>foreign reserves, should, for now, help the sector weather </p><p>the storm.  However, a longer-than expected conflict will </p><p>require the continued attention and diligence of the CBJ, and </p><p>anything we can to support that effort will be in our </p><p>interests as much as in the interest of the Government of </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
