<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003795 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>MOSCOW, TEL AVIV FOR BOLTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY WILL PROVIDE TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF OEF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03795  011550Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ROME 3760 (NOTAL) </p><p>     B. B) ROME 3703 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI WILL </p><p>RECOMMEND TO PARLIAMENT THAT ITALY SEND TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, ACCORDING TO </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S TOP ADVISOR, GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA.  IN A </p><p>MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR SEMBLER AND A/DCM ON AUGUST 1 TO </p><p>FOLLOW-UP ON A JULY 31 DISCUSSION (REFTEL A), CASTELLANETA </p><p>SAID THE GOI WOULD LIKE US INPUT ON TWO OPTIONS THAT ARE </p><p>BEING DISCUSSED BY THE PM\'S OFFICE, THE CHIEF OF DEFENSE AND </p><p>THE ITALIAN LIAISON CELL IN TAMPA.  UNDER OPTION 1, ITALY </p><p>WOULD SEND 1,000 ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO KFOR TO FREE UP US </p><p>TROOPS FOR OEF.  THIS COULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW.  UNDER OPTION 2, ITALY WOULD SEND </p><p>TROOPS (EITHER COMBAT OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES) TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  THIS WOULD INVOLVE PARLIAMENTARY CONSULTATIONS, </p><p>IF NOT A VOTE, WHICH WOULD MEAN WAITING FOR PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>RETURN IN MID-SEPTEMBER.  IF THE USG PREFERS OPTION 2, THE </p><p>GOI NEEDS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPE OF MISSION </p><p>ANTICIPATED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHICH TROOPS SHOULD BE </p><p>DEPLOYED, CASTELLANETA SAID. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) NOTING THAT THE US WOULD LIKELY BE RELUCTANT TO SET </p><p>OFF SUSPICIONS THAT WE ARE WITHDRAWING SUPPORT FROM BALKANS </p><p>OPERATIONS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID OPTION 2 MAY BE PREFERRED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03795  011550Z </p><p>HE ASKED WHETHER PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW IS LEGALLY NECESSARY, </p><p>OR MORE OF A POLITICAL REQUIREMENT.  CASTELLANETA CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT THERE IS A REAL POLITICAL, NOT LEGAL, NEED TO CONSULT </p><p>WITH PARLIAMENT, BUT PREDICTED THAT THE PROCESS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>LEAD TO STRONGER PUBLIC AND POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR DEPLOYING </p><p>ITALIAN TROOPS.  BERLUSCONI WOULD RAISE THE REQUEST WITH </p><p>PARLIAMENT IN MID-SEPTEMBER, AND TROOPS COULD BE DEPLOYED IN </p><p>THE FALL, BEFORE THE AFGHAN WINTER BEGINS, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CASTELLANETA SAID AMBASSADOR SALLEO, WHO RECENTLY MET </p><p>WITH PENTAGON OFFICIALS, HAD REPORTED STRONG REGARD WITHIN </p><p>DOD FOR THE ALPINI BRIGADE.  AGAIN, CASTELLANETA URGED THAT </p><p>WE PROVIDE MORE PRECISE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MISSION SO THAT </p><p>THE GOI CAN DETERMINE WHICH TROOPS WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE </p><p>TO SEND.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED HIM THAT THE EMBASSY WILL </p><p>SHARE THE DETAILS WE OBTAIN FROM WASHINGTON, BUT EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT TAMPA IS THE CENTRAL POINT FOR COORDINATING DISCUSSIONS </p><p>ABOUT OPERATIONAL DETAILS, SUCH AS WHICH TYPE OF FORCES ARE </p><p>NEEDED AND WHEN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE INFORM EMBASSY WHICH OPTION IS </p><p>PREFERRED: BACKFILLING TROOPS IN THE BALKANS (OPTION 1) OR </p><p>DEPLOYING TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN (OPTION 2).  A RESPONSE </p><p>BEFORE MONDAY, AUGUST 5 WOULD ALLOW U/S BOLTON TO DELIVER THE </p><p>USG RESPONSE TO SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS, INCLUDING CASTELLANETA, </p><p>WHILE HE IS IN ROME.  IF OPTION 2 IS PREFERRED, AS WE EXPECT, </p><p>PLEASE PROVIDE AVAILABLE DETAILS REGARDING THE EXPECTED </p><p>MISSION IN ORDER TO HELP THE ITALIANS IDENTIFY THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE TROOPS TO DEPLOY.  WE WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE </p><p>FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING WHICH TROOPS ARE ROTATING OUT </p><p>AND WHEN FROM OTHER CONTRIBUTING COUNTRIES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03795  011550Z </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03795 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
