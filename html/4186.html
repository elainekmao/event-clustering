(C) Since the September 28 - 29 Rural District Council </p><p>elections, ZANU-PF supporters have carried out a violent </p><p>campaign of retribution against winning MDC councilors and </p><p>MDC supporters in districts that elected MDC councilors.  At </p><p>least one MDC supporter was beaten to death.  Winning (and </p><p>losing) MDC councilor candidates, and polling agents have </p><p>been beaten, ordinary MDC supporters have been beaten and </p><p>raped, MDC supporters\' houses have been burned, and MDC </p><p>offices have been attacked.  Violence and food denial </p><p>continue to be effective tactics, as feeding and protecting </p><p>their families are higher priorities for most Zimbabwean </p><p>oppositionists than challenging a government they despise. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Since the September 28 - 29 Rural District Council </p><p>elections, ZANU-PF supporters have carried out a campaign of </p><p>retribution against winning MDC councilors and MDC supporters </p><p>in districts that elected MDC councilors.  Other reports of </p><p>violence spanning the election period are now surfacing. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Supporter Tortured and Killed </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3. (U) On October 21 according to MDC officials and press </p><p>reports MDC supporter Isaac Karimete died of wounds inflicted </p><p>when he was abducted and tortured by ZANU-PF militia in the </p><p>run-up to the Rural District Council elections in late </p><p>September.  Karimete was one of more than a hundred MDC </p><p>supporters who were abducted and taken to the Gunduza school </p><p>in Gunduza, which was being used to detain and beat MDC </p><p>supporters, one of three sites set up by ZANU-PF in </p><p>Mashonaland Central province before the September 28 - 29 </p><p>elections.  (The other two were in Mushinye and Chimoyo.) </p><p>Known or suspected MDC members were taken to these three </p><p>sites, pressured to defect to ZANU-PF, and beaten or raped </p><p>when they refused.  After Karimete\'s detention, militia </p><p>members told him to leave his home in Muzarabani.  Though he </p><p>was able to identify at least four of his assailants, there </p><p>were no reports of arrests in the case. </p><p> </p><p>Winning Councilors and Losing Candidates Beaten </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>4. (C) According to press reports, on October 12 ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters led by the party\'s Hwange East District Chairman </p><p>and war veteran Gerald Moyo stoned and beat recently </p><p>re-elected MDC Kamativi district councilor Matthew Ngwenya, </p><p>and his wife in Kamativi, Matabeleland North.  According to </p><p>Ngwenya, a mob of ZANU-PF supporters, including the losing </p><p>ZANU-PF candidate, approached their home saying, "today you </p><p>will be in trouble," and "we want you dead".  The losing </p><p>candidate reportedly said, "we need to kill a donkey" </p><p>referring to Ngwenya.  The mob stoned the house, breaking all </p><p>the windows, and pried the doors off the hinges to get at the </p><p>Ngwenyas.  They were force marched to a nearby bush area </p><p>where they were separated and both beaten, Matthew to the </p><p>point of unconsciousness.  When Poloff interviewed the couple </p><p>at the Amani Trust offices (a local NGO treating victims of </p><p>political violence) on October 24 in Bulawayo, they each had </p><p>bruises and cuts over their faces and bodies, and Matthew\'s </p><p>left arm was broken in two places.  The couple is afraid to </p><p>return to Kamativi.  ZANU-PF officials had previously </p><p>pressured Ngwenya to return to the party; he defected to MDC </p><p>in July 2002 while serving as councilor of Kamativi. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) According to MDC officials and press reports, on </p><p>October 18  a truckload of ZANU-PF youth militia members </p><p>allegedly sent by the ZANU-PF Provincial Chairman for </p><p>Matabeleland North, Jacob Mudenda, beat MDC supporters and 16 </p><p>newly elected MDC councilors gathered for their swearing-in </p><p>ceremony in Binga.  Jeffrey Nyoni, the MDC councilor for </p><p>Silakenge ward, as well as Mr. Mdhimba, the ZANU-PF </p><p>Provincial Administrator who oversaw the ceremony, were in </p><p>critical condition as a result of the beating.  (Note: </p><p>Mdhimba, though a ZANU-PF official, was beaten for organizing </p><p>the swearing-in ceremony in accordance with his official </p><p>duties.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) According to MDC officials and press reports, on </p><p>October 12  the newly elected councilor for Mzola ward in </p><p>Nkayi, Matabeleland North, Themba Dlomo was addressing a </p><p>post-election meeting when ZANU-PF supporters, led by war </p><p>veteran Francis Nyoni, attacked everyone assembled.  Police </p><p>responding to the scene arrested twenty-one MDC supporters, </p><p>twelve of whom were remanded in custody and due to appear in </p><p>Hwange Magistrate\'s Court on October 29.  There were no </p><p>reports of ZANU-PF supporters arrested.  MDC officials </p><p>reported that Nyoni and his group were planning to attack </p><p>another MDC councilor, Thomas Nyathi, of Matshokotsha ward in </p><p>the same constituency. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On October 1, according to MDC officials and press </p><p>reports, the day after results of the Rural District Council </p><p>elections were announced, unknown assailants assaulted Veni </p><p>Muleya, a newly-elected MDC councilor in Mutsheseo ward in </p><p>Binga, and Sofia Ngwenya, the MDC losing candidate for Tinde </p><p>ward in Binga, and burnt their homes to the ground. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) According to MDC officials and press reports, on </p><p>September 28,  the first day of voting for the Rural District </p><p>Council elections, ZANU-PF youths and war veterans assaulted </p><p>and beat Francisca Ngwende, the MDC candidate for Murehwa </p><p>South\'s ward 24, and her polling agents as they waited for </p><p>transport to take them to polling stations.  Ngwende suffered </p><p>a fractured left hand, and her polling agent, Rumbidzai </p><p>Mutava, was hospitalized for injuries sustained in the </p><p>attack.  On January 31 ZANU-PF supporters had burnt Ngwende </p><p>and her husband\'s (who is a war veteran and MDC member) house </p><p>to the ground.  Though the assailants are known in both </p><p>cases, no arrests have been made. </p><p> </p><p>Polling Agents Arrested / Beaten </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>9. (U) On October 24, according to MDC officials and press </p><p>reports, war veterans in Zaka assaulted and severely beat </p><p>Last Njokoza, an MDC polling agent for the Rural Council </p><p>elections.  The war veterans reportedly called a meeting on </p><p>the pretext of distributing food.  They singled out MDC </p><p>supporters in the crowd including Njokoza and several other </p><p>polling agents and beat them in front of the crowd, </p><p>threatening to beat anyone else who supported the MDC. </p><p>Police said they were investigating the matter; no arrests </p><p>were made. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) According to press reports, on October 28 around </p><p>midnight police arrested eleven MDC polling agents for the </p><p>Insiza by-elections from their homes in the Bulawayo area. </p><p>They were held for a day, assaulted, questioned and released. </p><p> According to press reports Bulawayo police spokesman, Smile </p><p>Dube, refused to comment on what charges they faced. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Supporters Held During Elections, Beaten, Raped </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>11. (U) According to MDC officials and press reports, on </p><p>September 21 (a week before the Rural Council elections) </p><p>ZANU-PF youths abducted Solomon Mazarire, the MDC Chairman </p><p>for Chadereka ward in Muzarabani, in broad daylight from the </p><p>vicinity of a ZANU-PF rally in Gunduza.  Addressing the </p><p>rally, Nobbie Dzini, ZANU-PF MP for Muzarabani, criticized </p><p>the youths for carrying out the operation in broad daylight </p><p>and emphasized that such activities should be done at night </p><p>so as to avoid notice.  Mazarire was held in Chimoyo and </p><p>repeatedly beaten.  On September 22 ZANU-PF militia members </p><p>abducted Mazaririe\'s wife Mercy, and their oldest daughter </p><p>Lynette (18), from their home in Chadereka and held them in </p><p>Gunduza.  Lillian (16) was detained briefly, but freed </p><p>allegedly to take care of their other five children.  Militia </p><p>members raped Lynette and beat both Mercy and Lynette with </p><p>barbed wire and logs.  All three were released on October 11. </p><p> Militia members confiscated MDC material and maize from the </p><p>Mazarire home and forced the family to leave Muzarabani. </p><p>There were no reports of arrests. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Councilors Forced to Defect to ZANU-PF </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>12. (U) According to MDC officials and press reports, ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters have pressured MDC councilors to join ZANU-PF.  In </p><p>Beedy (between Matobo and Kezi, Matabeleland South province) </p><p>the recently elected MDC councilor was forced to defect to </p><p>ZANU-PF.  To maintain the peace, his constituents have </p><p>reportedly agreed to the switch--expected to be formalized </p><p>soon.  In ward three in the Gwanda district of Matabeleland </p><p>South, winning MDC councilor Nkanyiso Nala went into hiding </p><p>and then defected to ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Supporters\' Homes Burned / Destroyed </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>13. (C) On October 17 war veterans in Matobo (south of </p><p>Bulawayo) burned to the ground the house of John Sibanda, </p><p>allegedly because Sibanda is an MDC activist, and had refused </p><p>a request by war veterans to be a "settler" on the nearby </p><p>Godwin farm earlier this year.  In an interview with Poloff </p><p>on October 24, Sibanda did not report any injury to his </p><p>family, but recounted that five other homesteads of families </p><p>who refused to be settlers have been burned in his area </p><p>recently. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Offices Attacked / Damaged </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>14. (U) According to press reports, on October 28 about 100 </p><p>ZANU-PF youths in Border Gezi "green bomber" uniforms </p><p>attacked the MDC offices in Bulawayo with stones, bricks, </p><p>axes, picks and logs.  The front of the building, office </p><p>equipment in the front rooms, five party vehicles, and one </p><p>private vehicle were damaged extensively in the 15-minute </p><p>attack.  MDC officials reported the identities of many of the </p><p>assailants to the police, who did not commit to investigating </p><p>the crime.  On the same day, suspected MDC youths attacked a </p><p>school in Bulawayo belonging to the ZANU-PF Deputy Political </p><p>Commissar; the chronology of the two events is unclear. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>15. (C) These cases suggest a campaign of retribution, </p><p>organized and constructed to intimidate people and convince </p><p>them to drop their support for the MDC.  The two-pronged </p><p>strategy of violence and food denial is proving very </p><p>effective at consolidating ZANU-PF\'s hold on power (Refs A, </p><p>C), as Zimbabweans sympathetic to opposition views are </p><p>understandably more interested in feeding their families and </p><p>protecting them from harm than in challenging a regime they </p><p>increasingly despise.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
