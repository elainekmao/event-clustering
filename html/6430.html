(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Summary and comment: In separate meetings </p><p>with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) CEO Yousef </p><p>bin Omeir and Deputy CEO Abdulla Nasser Al-Suweidi on </p><p>March 17, Econchief was provided an unprecedented look </p><p>at ADNOC\'s production and surge capabilities.  ADNOC </p><p>can produce up to 2.5 million barrels per day (mmb/d) </p><p>on a sustainable basis and has significant short-term </p><p>surge capacity -- close to 2.8 mmb/d.  We are not </p><p>aware that the ADNOC leadership has ever provided such </p><p>detailed information to the USG before (and indeed, </p><p>securing this cooperation required political-level </p><p>engagement -- see ref B).  That they were so </p><p>forthcoming likely reflects a willingness to assist in </p><p>stabilizing the oil market should that prove necessary </p><p>in the weeks to come.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Current Capacity About 2.5 MMB/D </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) ADNOC CEO Yousef bin Omeir admitted that </p><p>ADNOC is producing at about 2.2 mmb/d, could ramp up </p><p>sustainable production to 2.4 mmb/d almost </p><p>instantaneously, and to 2.5 mmb/d in "a matter of </p><p>days," if necessary.  According to ADNOC Deputy CEO </p><p>Al-Suweidi, ADNOC has the capability to shift </p><p>production from field to field easily.  ADCO (Abu </p><p>Dhabi\'s onshore production company), for example, had </p><p>ramped up production to 1.35 mmb/d for a couple of </p><p>days last week to help compensate for the total shut- </p><p>down of offshore operations due to dangerously high </p><p>winds. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Al-Suweidi systematically described production </p><p>levels in each of Abu Dhabi\'s main fields and said </p><p>that ADNOC could sustain 2.5 mmb/d indefinitely under </p><p>current reservoir management policies.  ADMA-OPCO </p><p>currently is producing about 500,000 barrels per day </p><p>and is close to peak production.  The Upper Zakum </p><p>field, operated by ZADCO, is producing about 570,000 </p><p>barrels per day and could produce 600,000 barrels per </p><p>day with 15 million cubic feet per day of gas flared. </p><p>ADCO peak sustainable production is about 1.4 mmb/d, </p><p>with the Bu Hasa field accounting for any significant </p><p>production increase.  He noted that, while ADNOC </p><p>usually limits the flaring of gas, it might relax </p><p>those restrictions during a crisis, as it had done </p><p>during the 1991 Gulf War, when more than 50 million </p><p>cubic feet per day was flared. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Surge Capacity Is Significant </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) ADNOC\'s leadership is not keen to produce </p><p>above 2.5 mmb/d out of a concern for potentially </p><p>damaging Abu Dhabi\'s fields and because environmental </p><p>considerations militate against the flaring of gas. </p><p>(Note: ADNOC has a "Zero Flaring" policy, but since </p><p>GASCO, the local gas processing company, does not have </p><p>the capacity to manage the additional associated gas, </p><p>higher oil output would require the flaring of the </p><p>excess gas.  End note.)  The ExxonMobil Country </p><p>Manager here (please protect) previously confirmed to </p><p>Econchief that ADNOC could surge to at least 2.6 </p><p>mmb/d, if needed.  Al-Suweidi said, however, that </p><p>ADNOC\'s short-term surge capability at the well-head </p><p>could be as much as 20 percent more than peak </p><p>production, suggesting a surge capacity closer to 2.8- </p><p>3.0 mmb/d. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF) Al-Suweidi acknowledged that while ADNOC </p><p>could hypothetically reach 3.0 mmb/d at the well-head, </p><p>being able to actually move, process, and export that </p><p>amount would require significant investment to </p><p>increase the capacity of the surface facilities (i.e. </p><p>the collection and processing facilities).  He said </p><p>that ADNOC\'s shareholders were not keen to invest in </p><p>additional spare capacity at this time, but it is </p><p>technically feasible nonetheless. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Other Factors Affecting Output </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) There are only a few other factors that </p><p>could hinder ADNOC from ramping up production </p><p>instantaneously in a crisis.  The weather sometimes </p><p>prohibits full production from the offshore </p><p>facilities, as was demonstrated last week.  To take </p><p>advantage of current high oil prices, ADNOC has </p><p>deferred scheduled maintenance in the near-term that </p><p>could affect the production of any one field. </p><p>Although we don\'t know to what degree higher insurance </p><p>premiums on tankers could affect ADNOC\'s ability to </p><p>put additional production on the market, Al-Suweidi </p><p>confirmed that ADNOC sells its oil FOB (free on board </p><p>-- customers provide their own tankers) and the </p><p>availability of tankers is outside of ADNOC\'s control. </p><p>Finally, ADNOC would have to receive specific </p><p>instructions from the Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) </p><p>to increase production significantly above current </p><p>levels.  Al-Suweidi undertook to inform us of any </p><p>change in the current situation that would affect the </p><p>UAE\'s production capabilities. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
