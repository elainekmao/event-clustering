Vietnam\'s ongoing struggle to understand the value of </p><p>protecting intellectual property rights was demonstrated </p><p>clearly in January when an article in "The Guide" magazine, </p><p>a monthly supplement to The Vietnam Economic Times (VET), </p><p>proudly promoted Hanoi as "home to a thriving trade in </p><p>copying CDs and DVDs".  It listed shops where pirated </p><p>materials could be purchased and provided tips on how to </p><p>identify good quality copies.  The article is part of "The </p><p>Guide\'s" monthly list of prime hotels, restaurants and </p><p>shopping locals in Vietnam\'s major cities.  In stark </p><p>contrast, the cover story of the companion issue of the VET </p><p>discussed "branding in Vietnam" - highlighting the need for </p><p>Vietnamese companies to register trademarks and build brand </p><p>awareness in order to promote Vietnamese products </p><p>internationally. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In response to U.S. industry complaints about the </p><p>article in "The Guide," Charge sent letters to the editor of </p><p>the VET as well as to the Vice Minister of Culture and </p><p>Information protesting the article and highlighting its </p><p>disregard for Vietnam\'s IPR commitments under both the U.S. </p><p>- Vietnam Copyright Agreement and the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral </p><p>Trade Agreement (BTA).  Charge also noted the damage such an </p><p>article can do to Vietnam\'s international reputation and its </p><p>investment climate.  Just 5 days later, Professor Dao Nguyen </p><p>Cat, Editor-in Chief of the VET, sent a reply to Charge that </p><p>acknowledged the impropriety of the "The Guide" article, </p><p>promised to amend the February issue and encouraged the USG </p><p>to continue its cooperation with Vietnam on copyright </p><p>issues.  As promised, the February edition of "The Guide" </p><p>did not include any information on purchasing pirated CDs or </p><p>DVDs in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT:  True to form, The Ministry of Culture has not </p><p>yet responded to Charge\'s request that it shut down the </p><p>CD/DVD shops which are well known for selling pirated goods </p><p>in Hanoi that were specifically cited in the January issue </p><p>of "The Guide".  Over the course of the last year, post has </p><p>sent several letters to the Ministry citing specific cases </p><p>of IPR violations and asking the Ministry to take action. </p><p>The Ministry often takes months to respond and rarely </p><p>directly acknowledges the IPR violation or details what </p><p>steps the Ministry will take to stop the violation and </p><p>prevent future recurrences.  In contrast, however, we were </p><p>encouraged by the rapid response of Mr. Cat, which not only </p><p>acknowledged the problem but also agreed to ensure "The </p><p>Guide" would not continue to promote piracy in subsequent </p><p>editions of the magazine. </p><p> </p><p>4.  As evidenced by the focus of the January issue of the </p><p>VET on branding (as well as a number of other recent </p><p>articles and seminars), there is growing awareness in many </p><p>sectors of Vietnam\'s economy of the need for IP protection </p><p>for Vietnamese products.  While this understanding is still </p><p>only evident among a small percentage of the population, it </p><p>is growing - among Vietnamese agricultural exporters, </p><p>software developers and artists, for example.  While these </p><p>groups are a long way from forming a critical mass, we </p><p>remain hopeful that as their numbers increase they will </p><p>begin to demand greater protection from the GVN for the IPR </p><p>of domestic industries.  Strong domestic demand for IP </p><p>protection may just be the additional element that will </p><p>compel the GVN to develop effective enforcement capabilities </p><p>in line with the international commitments it has made to </p><p>protect IPR. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
