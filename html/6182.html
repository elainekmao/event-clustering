<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, SOCI, VM, HIV/AIDS, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  COMMUNITY DRUG TREATMENT IN VIETNAM:  NOT MUCH TO IT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.  Hanoi 353  B.  02 Hanoi 2836 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Despite improved national guidance on </p><p>community drug treatment as well as an increasing awareness </p><p>among authorities of the need for more rehabilitation </p><p>services at different levels, implementation appears rather </p><p>thin and uneven, primarily due to a lack of trained </p><p>personnel and insufficient resources at the local level. </p><p>The focus of community drug treatment is detoxification, </p><p>after which, official "peer pressure" seems to be virtually </p><p>the only component.  Ref a reported on Vietnam\'s drug </p><p>treatment centers.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>POLICY FRAMEWORK </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Vietnam offers two main forms of treatment for drug </p><p>addicts.  One is a network of drug treatment centers spread </p><p>throughout the country.  Some addicts are sent to centers </p><p>for "compulsory" treatment; others arrive voluntarily. </p><p>According to the Standing Office of Drug Control (SODC), </p><p>there are 73 centers at the provincial level, which have a </p><p>capacity of between 50 to 3,000 addicts each.  Provincial </p><p>authorities support most centers, but others are supported </p><p>by mass organizations, such as the Youth Union (ref a). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In addition to the national network of provincial </p><p>drug treatment centers (ref a), there is also a community </p><p>drug treatment structure.  (Comment:  This is in line with </p><p>Vietnam\'s "vertical structure" form of government as well as </p><p>its tradition of "mobilizing" the population to help solve </p><p>social and other problems.  End Comment.)  The "National Law </p><p>on Drug Prevention and Suppression," passed by the National </p><p>Assembly in 2000, established the broad policy for drug </p><p>treatment in its Chapter Four.  The law, while relatively </p><p>general, notes that the "State encourages individuals, </p><p>families, agencies, and other organizations to implement </p><p>home-based and community based detoxification. . ." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Since the law\'s passage, the GVN has issued </p><p>additional directives pertaining to community drug </p><p>treatment.  On May 15, 2002, the GVN issued Decree 56 (ref </p><p>b), which addresses family and community based treatment. </p><p>It stipulated that the minimum length of community treatment </p><p>should be six months and that such treatment must be </p><p>conducted in accordance with five steps developed by the </p><p>Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) and </p><p>the Ministry of Health, including:  (1) reception and </p><p>classification; (2) detoxification; (3) education; (4) work; </p><p>and, (5) supervised return to the community.  In addition, </p><p>there are provisions for closer supervision over the addicts </p><p>by local authorities, as well as a provision for assistance </p><p>in detoxification assistance if home treatment is </p><p>unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to Dr. Tran Xuan Sac, MOLISA\'s Deputy </p><p>Section Chief of the Department for Social Evils Prevention, </p><p>the goal of Decree 56 was to enhance the effectiveness of </p><p>community and family-based treatment by having professional </p><p>advice and some medicines more readily available.  He opined </p><p>that this could help relieve some of the pressure on the </p><p>compulsory treatment centers.  Dr. Sac noted that, while </p><p>families are responsible for the most costs for this </p><p>treatment (except detoxification), they are eligible for </p><p>"preferential government loans."  In an effort to encourage </p><p>vocational education, organizations that provide such </p><p>training to addicts also may receive such loans, he added. </p><p>Local authorities subsidize the cost for the initial </p><p>detoxification process (usually seven to 10 days) up to a </p><p>maximum of 250,000 VND (approximately USD 20). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Following up on Decree 56, the GVN issued an </p><p>interministerial circular in January 2003 that provides </p><p>further guidance.  According to the circular, addicts </p><p>admitted to community-based treatment should also receive </p><p>reeducation classes from the local authorities.  However, </p><p>recovering addicts may be held "criminally liable" for </p><p>continued drug use.  According to Dr. Sac, this means that </p><p>addicts undergoing community-based treatment who continue to </p><p>use drugs "may be sent" to compulsory drug treatment </p><p>centers, if the local People\'s Committee determines this is </p><p>necessary. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Dr. Sac noted that criteria regarding participation </p><p>in community drug treatment vary among localities.  This is </p><p>due, in part, to available resources, he added.  However, </p><p>"normally, heavy addicts or those who have used hard drugs </p><p>(i.e., heroin) for over three years are not eligible," he </p><p>said.  According to Dr. Sac, MOLISA views community drug </p><p>treatment as more suitable for less severely addicted </p><p>individuals.  The chairman of the local People\'s Committee </p><p>makes the final decision on an individual\'s participation, </p><p>with the advice of an advisory committee consisting of the </p><p>police, local social affairs and health officials, and </p><p>various mass organizations, such as the Youth and Women\'s </p><p>Unions. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ON THE GROUND REALITIES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  During poloffs\' visit to the Thuy Ai detoxification </p><p>center in Hanoi\'s Hai Ba Trung district, Dr. Nguyen The Dan, </p><p>the official in charge, said that most addicts arrive at his </p><p>center "at the urging" of their families or local </p><p>authorities.  His staff evaluates each addict prior to </p><p>admittance to determine eligibility.  Some addicts admitted </p><p>are HIV-positive, he added.  The day we visited, six new </p><p>addicts were admitted for detoxification; among them were </p><p>three who are HIV-positive, according to Dr. Dan. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Dr. Dan said that addicts normally stay at his </p><p>center about 10 days.  He claimed that nearly all who enter </p><p>the detoxification process complete it successfully.  At the </p><p>end of the process, his staff tests the addicts.  If they </p><p>appear to be "detoxified," they may return to their families </p><p>for home-based treatment.  Dr. Dan could not say </p><p>specifically what the "treatment" at home entailed, but </p><p>noted that the addicts receive "regular" visits from local </p><p>officials who "encourage" them to stay away from drugs </p><p>and/or "their drug-using" friends.  Dr. Dan said that he </p><p>knew of no literature sent home with the addicts to provide </p><p>advice to their families, but added that his medical staff </p><p>"stays in contact" and "may make a home visit" if the family </p><p>so desires.  While lamenting that the center has no trained </p><p>drug counselors, Dr. Dan claimed that hands-on experience in </p><p>the detoxification center and medical training enables the </p><p>staff to provide "useful advice and support" to recovering </p><p>addicts and their families. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Dr. Dan noted that a recent survey of "graduates" </p><p>from the community treatment in his local area concluded </p><p>that the recidivism rate is "about 72 percent."  He said </p><p>that, while this compared favorably to provincial drug </p><p>treatment centers, "it must be understood that we are </p><p>generally dealing with a less severely addicted population." </p><p>(Note:  The GVN claims a recidivism rate of about 80 </p><p>percent, but a more realistic figure is probably in the 90- </p><p>95 percent range, similar to other countries.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Tuyet Huong, manager of a "club" for recovering </p><p>addicts that works with Dr. Dan\'s center, said that she </p><p>holds "voluntary" weekly meetings at the center.  At the </p><p>meetings, recovering addicts get together and talk about </p><p>their efforts to stay away from drugs.  There are also </p><p>lectures from local officials, who emphasize the need to </p><p>avoid drugs as well as the value of various recreational </p><p>activities and physical training.  Huong said that she also </p><p>works with local employers to help find jobs for recovering </p><p>addicts.  Huong noted that "work is a very important part of </p><p>staying away from drugs."  During the course of our visit, </p><p>we spoke with two recovering addicts working in a nearby </p><p>motorbike washing facility.  With officials present, they </p><p>said that the center had been "very helpful" to their </p><p>recovery and they "appreciated"  having a job and knowing </p><p>there was a place they could go for activities and support. </p><p>One of the recovering addicts noted that, while he had the </p><p>opportunity to participate in community treatment, he knew </p><p>of others who had committed criminal acts and were "forced" </p><p>by local authorities to go to drug treatment centers. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The community drug treatment services available in </p><p>Chau Khe commune, Bac Ninh Province, were far less developed </p><p>compared to Hanoi.  Nguyen Khanh Lan, Director, Sub- </p><p>department for Social Evils Prevention, Bac Ninh Department </p><p>of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, said that community </p><p>drug treatment has been an option in Bac Ninh since 1991. </p><p>He added that, while local drug problems are less severe </p><p>than in Hanoi, proximity to the capital had resulted in a </p><p>"significant and growing drug problem" in the province.  In </p><p>terms of its socio-economic status and addict population, </p><p>Chau Khe commune, with a population of about 17,000, is </p><p>"typical," he claimed. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Nguyen Van Huong, Deputy Chairman of the commune </p><p>People\'s Committee, said that detoxification is "about the </p><p>only" organized aspect of community drug treatment, however. </p><p>Similar to Hanoi, after successfully completing the </p><p>detoxification process, addicts are sent home, where they </p><p>"are supervised by their families, local officials, and the </p><p>mass organizations."  According to Huong, there is no </p><p>community center, outreach program, support group, or job </p><p>placement.  Huong claimed that local officials and/or </p><p>representatives from mass organizations cover outreach </p><p>through periodic home visits.  During these visits, </p><p>according to Huong, officials provide "advice" about the </p><p>need to stay away from drugs.  However, the recidivism rate </p><p>is about 85 percent, Lan admitted. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Lan and Huong separately emphasized the commune\'s </p><p>need for more support to provide better services.  Huong </p><p>said that he had appealed for more provincial support, but </p><p>without success so far.  He lamented that the province will </p><p>only contribute a "modest amount" for detoxification.  With </p><p>more resources, Huong said that he would hire a counselor to </p><p>provide professional services recovering addicts and their </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  From our discussions with MOLISA and review of </p><p>available laws, we expected a more comprehensive approach to </p><p>community drug treatment.  Questions regarding the specifics </p><p>of what actually happens when addicts return home were met </p><p>with long-winded and rather vague responses.  With further </p><p>probing, it became clearer that what authorities consider </p><p>"community treatment" consists essentially of detoxification </p><p>followed (or not even) by lectures on the evil of taking </p><p>drugs, leaving open the possibility that officials could use </p><p>compulsory center treatment as a potential threat or </p><p>punishment for "lapses."  While local officials with whom we </p><p>met appear committed to the idea of community drug treatment </p><p>and rehabilitation as one way of dealing with the drug </p><p>issue, Vietnam\'s systemic problem of insufficient public </p><p>sector resources (felt most acutely at the local level) </p><p>prevents a more comprehensive approach.  Without significant </p><p>help from the foreign donor community, major improvements in </p><p>community drug treatment are unlikely any time soon. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
