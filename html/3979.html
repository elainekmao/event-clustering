<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 002044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A TRIP TO IBADAN IN OYO STATE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  A trip to Ibadan in Oyo State shows </p><p>residents of the southwest are already revving up for the </p><p>elections in 2003. Dr. Omulolu Olunloyo, who was governor of </p><p>Oyo State more than a decade ago, has decided to come out of </p><p>semi-retirement to run again for that office "for the good of </p><p>the nation."   Dr. Anthony Marinho, medical doctor and </p><p>community activist, wants to run his successful citizenship </p><p>program to prepare voters for the upcoming elections. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Blast from the past - Olunloyo wants to be governor again </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On a recent trip to Ibadan to make introductory calls </p><p>on local politicians and NGOs, PolOffs met with Dr. (Chief) </p><p>Omololu Olunloyo, former Governor of Oyo State (1983). </p><p>Olunloyo was warm and welcoming, but said that he did not </p><p>grant interviews or meetings these days to "just anybody." </p><p>He said he wanted Nigeria\'s friends to remember that Nigeria </p><p>is the most populous and important country in sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa and that it has a history of credibility in the </p><p>international community.  However, the country is at a </p><p>crossroads in its journey towards democracy and a stable </p><p>economy, so Olunloyo has decided to run for Governor because </p><p>"things are at such a bad pass in Nigeria someone needs to </p><p>step forward and show the people how things should be done." </p><p>Although he heads a highly successful civil engineering firm, </p><p>Olunloyo has sought or accepted positions in government at </p><p>various times over the past thirty years.  His last foray </p><p>into politics was in 1992 when he was proposed as a possible </p><p>vice president for the Socialist Democratic Party </p><p>presidential candidate, the late Major General Shehu </p><p>Yar\'adua.  (Comment. The elections in 1992 were nullified and </p><p>the late military ruler, Sani Abacha, was installed as </p><p>leader.  Yar\'adua, was imprisoned in 1995 for pushing Abacha </p><p>to step down and allow a return to civilian government by </p><p>1996.  Yar\'adua died in prison in 1997. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  While strolling through his small English garden </p><p>(geese on the lawn and yew hedges), Olunloyo expounded on the </p><p>problems facing Nigeria and what he thought could be done to </p><p>solve them.  "I should be able to retire now, pass the baton </p><p>to someone else and watch the political race from the </p><p>sidelines," he mused. However, Nigeria, despite billions in </p><p>oil revenue and a return to a civilian government after </p><p>sixteen years of military rule, "hadn\'t really gotten </p><p>anywhere."  Olunloyo believes that to make progress Nigeria </p><p>needs first, a majority of the people willing to sacrifice to </p><p>improve and advance as a nation, and, second, a government </p><p>that has the ability to meet the needs of the people.  He </p><p>said that one of his goals, should he be elected, would be to </p><p>work to get international assistance of every kind, "to make </p><p>Nigeria a better place for all its citizens.  There is no </p><p>need to waste time re-inventing the wheel."  Nigerians must </p><p>learn from other modern nations, not just the U.S. and </p><p>Britain.  He pointed to the nations of Asia and Europe that </p><p>recovered from the devastation of World War II to become </p><p>global competitors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Back in his book-filled office, Olunloyo expressed his </p><p>ideas on the political scene, saying that many in the current </p><p>government, especially at the local and State level, were </p><p>"risen from poverty and are the first in their families or </p><p>groups to be successful."  He proposed that what Nigeria </p><p>needs is to draw its leaders from the pool of highly </p><p>educated, professional and experienced Nigerians both </p><p>in-country and abroad. On the economy, Olunloyo agreed with </p><p>most modern economists that Nigeria could not continue to </p><p>rely on its one highly profitable but depletable </p><p>resource--oil.  However, he found economic opportunity in </p><p>areas rejected as too long-term to be helpful by several </p><p>Nigerians we have talked to.  Olunloyo says Nigeria has a </p><p>wealth of historical resources to depend on other than oil. </p><p>He mentioned agriculture, food crop production, food </p><p>processing, textiles, and herbal medicines.  He hinted that </p><p>he had information that the Nigerian Institute for the Study </p><p>of Herbal Medicines was close to an herbal treatment for </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  He concluded, saying "I am optimistic that the </p><p>remedy for Nigeria\'s problems is in our own hands, and with </p><p>help from our friends in the international community, we will </p><p>realize our greatness." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gynecologist with a broad view </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  The trip across the city of Ibadan to meet with Dr. </p><p>Anthony Marinho says much about the state of the </p><p>infrastructure in southern Nigeria.  The road to Ibadan is </p><p>the main road north from the port of Lagos and is a major </p><p>trucking route.  For much of the distance between the two </p><p>cities the road is well-maintained, and though traffic is </p><p>heavy with trucks and private vehicles, it moves at highway </p><p>speeds.  Entering the city, traffic on this route (which </p><p>becomes the main street through the city) snarls and comes to </p><p>a complete standstill due to the road\'s condition.  On the </p><p>way to the meeting PolOffs were held for an hour while </p><p>traffic eased around a large truck that had capsized </p><p>navigating past an axle-deep pothole that stretched across </p><p>the width of the road.  (Comment. The evening before on the </p><p>way to dinner on the same road, driving was made even more </p><p>challenging by the lack of working street lights anywhere in </p><p>the city.  One is warned to take pothole-evasion action when </p><p>the taillights of the vehicle in front disappear.  End </p><p>comment.)  Nonetheless, we arrived for our meeting only a few </p><p>minutes late. </p><p>6. (U) Dr. Marinho is a Nigeria-trained and practicing </p><p>obstetrician and gynecologist.  He is more well-known in the </p><p>southwest, however, as a community activist and founder of </p><p>Educare Trust.  Educare is an NGO started in 1994 stating its </p><p>purposes were "to improve education at all levels for our </p><p>girls and boys..., to promote civic education, democracy and </p><p>good governance in the belief that these are fundamental to </p><p>sustainable development..., and to emphasize the development </p><p>of morals and avoidance of social vices such as smoking, AIDS </p><p>and drugs."  The headquarters are located on one floor of a </p><p>small, well-maintained office building, and are equipped with </p><p>computers and other usual office machines.  Educare has </p><p>developed literature, seminars and workshops that cover </p><p>subjects from AIDS to voter registration.  At the </p><p>headquarters, Educare offers young people basic computer </p><p>training, career guidance, and special tutoring.  There is </p><p>also a tiny library geared to the secondary school student. </p><p>Of particular interest to PolOffs was the citizenship/voter </p><p>education program that Educare had developed with USAID </p><p>funding for the 1999 elections.  According to Marinho, this </p><p>program was very successful at the time and a similar program </p><p>was needed for the upcoming elections.  Marinho said that the </p><p>most important element was to encourage all voters to </p><p>register, especially those citizens who had either not </p><p>registered in the last elections or those who had come of </p><p>voting age since the 1999 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment.  Olunloyo is a member of President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) and served with </p><p>Yar\'adua in Obasanjo\'s first administration in 1989.  He told </p><p>us he has set his sights on the "small job" of being governor </p><p>of Oyo State, and he studiously avoided comment on Obasanjo\'s </p><p>current administration or the impeachment attempt.  It is </p><p>still early in the run-up to elections and Olunloyo\'s </p><p>candidacy appears to be a cat\'s paw to tease the entrenched </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD) party that currently controls the </p><p>southwest by showing it that the PDP can field a credible </p><p>candidate.  Whether Olunloyo will stay in the race appears </p><p>doubtful.  Marinho is apolitical, but well-respected, </p><p>well-known, and influential in the southwest.  Although he </p><p>claims no party affiliation, he has shown that his </p><p>organizations and associates are effective at encouraging </p><p>youth to participate in good government. He continues to </p><p>receive funding and donations from private industry here and </p><p>from the international community and charitable foundations. </p><p>He may be a significant factor in the upcoming elections in </p><p>energizing the youth vote and in voter registration in Oyo </p><p>State. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
