<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  HARD LABOR: EFFORTS TOWARDS A LIVING WAGE, </p><p>REALISTIC PRICES, AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Harare 267 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary. Laboff met with labor representatives to </p><p>touch base on issues including the ongoing Tripartite </p><p>Negotiating Forum (TNF) talks and the proposed National </p><p>Economic Recovery Plan (NERP).  The TNF sub-committees are </p><p>currently negotiating minimum wages, with the ball in the </p><p>employers\' court -- specific wages were proposed by labor </p><p>and were reported back to employers for their response, with </p><p>counter-proposals expected sometime this week.  Although </p><p>there seems to be consensus within the TNF that price </p><p>controls are ineffective, nobody has assumed the burden of </p><p>announcing their elimination.  Finally, the Zimbabwe </p><p>Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) continues to participate in </p><p>the TNF process in an effort to exhaust all possible </p><p>remedies before endorsing any call for mass action. </p><p>However, once this process proves fruitless, those elements </p><p>of the ZCTU who would support a call for mass action believe </p><p>they could mobilize large-scale support.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Twin Pillars:  Higher Wages and ... </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The negotiations regarding minimum wages continue, </p><p>and labor has floated a proposal for three levels (in the </p><p>general range of $20,000 for agricultural workers, $40,000 </p><p>for agro-industrial workers, and $60,000 for industrial </p><p>workers), which has not yet been approved.  Reportedly, the </p><p>employers -- concerned about the expenses -- are discussing </p><p>this in terms of viability, and are expected to come back </p><p>with a counter-proposal sometime this week.  If there is </p><p>consensus among the social partners, the proposals will then </p><p>go to the Cabinet for approval.  The GOZ, of course, may </p><p>make a unilateral declaration that the employers\' counter- </p><p>proposal is acceptable, regardless of the position taken by </p><p>labor.  However, labor is hopeful that agreement can be </p><p>reached, since there seems to be a combined will to reach </p><p>consensus on minimum wages, with only the actual amount </p><p>outstanding. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>... Higher Prices </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Regarding price controls, the unexpected report is </p><p>that all three "social partners" -- including the GOZ -- </p><p>recognize that price controls are neither working nor even </p><p>necessary.  However, they are too populist a measure for the </p><p>GOZ to publicly abandon.  This is one of the few public </p><p>efforts being made as a concession to the "struggling </p><p>masses," and nobody will accept the unpopular duty of making </p><p>the suggestion to abandon controls outright.  There is </p><p>widespread admission, within the TNF, that price controls </p><p>(if they are maintained) must be tied to the cost of inputs, </p><p>including the cost of labor.  The labor representatives </p><p>suggested that a TNF review board will be tasked with the </p><p>responsibility of reviewing controlled prices on a regular </p><p>basis, and raising them as necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Labor is dismissive of any possibility that NERP </p><p>(without addressing the underlying economic discrepancies) </p><p>will ease the economic strains on the average worker.  The </p><p>Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has previously </p><p>stated that only radical economic changes will have any </p><p>effect on the economy, and thus on the situation of workers. </p><p>Labor is equally uncertain that the TNF will adequately </p><p>address the needs of workers.  Despite this, the ZCTU has </p><p>suggested that its participation in TNF process is necessary </p><p>before it can call -- on an official level -- for support of </p><p>any mass action against the GOZ.  Since up to one-third of </p><p>the ZCTU constituency is pro-Zanu-PF, this faction will not </p><p>support mass action until all other avenues of dialogue have </p><p>proven fruitless.  Of course, many segments of the ZCTU are </p><p>idealistically aligned with the opposition, and some will </p><p>support calls for mass action regardless of their origin. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Comment:  The TNF process continues to chug along, </p><p>although well behind schedule.  Originally, the wage freeze </p><p>was set to run from January through June 2003.  There is </p><p>still no consensus on the level at which wages should be </p><p>frozen, and it is already mid-March.  While the original </p><p>proposal from labor groups suggested that price controls be </p><p>abandoned, it is more likely that the final product will </p><p>simply re-package the retreat from price controls under a </p><p>new name,just as devaluation has become "export support </p><p>mechanism" in GOZ-speak.  Some GOZ officials have already </p><p>begun to rename controls as "price management."  At this </p><p>point, there is working-level agreement on finding a living </p><p>minimum wage and attempting to tie consumer prices to the </p><p>real cost of inputs, including labor.  Whether these goals </p><p>can be reached remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  Labor also seems committed to  playing out the </p><p>role of committed "social partner" before taking on the role </p><p>of opposition sympathizer.  Given the many direct and </p><p>sometimes personal attacks on the ZCTU by the GOZ over the </p><p>past year, the labor organization seems determined to follow </p><p>each step in sequence.   Although it remains wary of the </p><p>final product, labor seems committed to participating in the </p><p>process.  Negotiating with an arguably illegitimate </p><p>government has its price, however.  As with the Commercial </p><p>Farmers Union (CFU) (reftel), GOZ spin-masters now portray </p><p>ZCTU as having abandoned MDC and foreign interests, falling </p><p>in line behind President Mugabe.  We have no doubt that the </p><p>GOZ uses these negotiations in its often successful attempts </p><p>to convince other African governments that the country\'s </p><p>political crisis is over. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
