(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT PORTER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02151  01 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.

ALTHOUGH NEITHER BELONGS TO THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY, BOTH HAVE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN PARTY </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DURING THEIR CAREERS AND REPORTEDLY </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENTIAL.  BOTH ARE STRONG ADVOCATES OF </p><p>REFORM, ECONOMIC AS WELL AS POLITICAL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH PHAN DINH DIEU </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) JOSEPH REES (COUNSEL TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS) AND BRIAN GUNDERSON (CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF TO HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER), ALONG WITH CONGENOFF, MET </p><p>WITH PROF. PHAN DINH DIEU ON AUGUST 10 AT HIS HOME IN </p><p>HANOI.  DIEU WAS A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATE IN THE </p><p>1970\'S.  CURRENTLY HE IS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE STEERING </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAM ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY </p><p>AND, ALTHOUGH NOT A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, IS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL PRESIDIUM OF THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SPEAKING MOSTLY IN ENGLISH, BUT OCCASIONALLY RELYING </p><p>ON AN INTERPRETER, SIXTY-FOUR-YEAR-OLD DIEU DESCRIBED </p><p>HIMSELF TO THE STAFFDEL AS A MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER </p><p>SCIENCE RESEARCHER.  HE TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS A NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY DELEGATE IN THE 1970\'S BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER </p><p>REUNIFICATION.  HE DESCRIBED THE FATHERLAND FRONT AS AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02151  01 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>SOCIETIES, BUT NOTED THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN THE FRONT AS </p><p>AN INDIVIDUAL AND AS A SCIENTIST.  "I AM NOT A POLITICIAN," </p><p>HE CLAIMED, "I AM A CITIZEN AND A PATRIOT." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DIEU SAID HE STUDIED IN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE </p><p>1960\'S.  HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE BELIEVED IN THE SOCIAL </p><p>AND HUMANITARIAN GOALS OF COMMUNISM, HIS YEARS IN THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION TAUGHT HIM THAT THOSE GOALS COULD NOT BE </p><p>REACHED THROUGH THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MECHANISMS HE </p><p>SAW THERE.  HE SAID THAT VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST PARTY HAD MADE </p><p>GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COUNTRY, BUT THAT HE FELT THE </p><p>COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY THAT WAS EFFECTIVE IN </p><p>WARTIME COULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>PEACETIME.  "I SAID THAT OPENLY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN </p><p>THE LATE 1970\'S, AND I STILL SAY SO TODAY QUITE OPENLY AND </p><p>PUBLICLY," HE DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN 1980, HE SAID, PRIME MINISTER PHAM VAN DONG </p><p>REQUESTED HIM TO PREPARE A PAPER CLARIFYING HIS IDEAS AND </p><p>SUGGESTIONS.  HE SAID HE CRAFTED A LONG STATEMENT ON </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BASED ON SCIENTIFIC METHODS, MARKET </p><p>MECHANISMS, AND A LOOSENING OF CENTRAL PLANNING AND </p><p>CONTROL.  HE SAID HE PARTICULARLY CRITICIZED THE IDEA OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S MILITARY BEING IN CHARGE OF MANAGING PEACETIME </p><p>BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.  IN 1980, DIEU SAID, THE LEADERS WERE </p><p>NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT THESE IDEAS, BUT BY 1986, THEY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR CHANGE.  HE SAID HE ENCOURAGED THEM </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE IDEA OF GRADUAL REFORMS, BEGINNING WITH THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF LIMITED MARKET MECHANISMS IN THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02151  01 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>7. (C) HE SAID HE WAS WITH PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL DO MUOI </p><p>IN 1989 DURING THE EVENING THE COUP TOOK PLACE IN THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION.  THAT EVENT HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL, DIEU SAID.  AFTERWARDS, DIEU SAID HE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ADVISED DO MUOI TO ACCEPT CHANGE BECAUSE IT WAS INEVITABLE, </p><p>AND FURTHER ADVISED THAT CHANGE COULD OCCUR STEP BY STEP, </p><p>RATHER THAN AS A CATACLYSMIC EVENT SUCH AS WHAT OCCURRED IN </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COMMUNIST STATES IN EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) REES INTERJECTED THAT WHAT DIEU SUGGESTED SOUNDED </p><p>LIKE "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION."  DIEU REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>PARTY DETESTS THE PHRASE "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION," THAT IN FACT </p><p>IS WHAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DIEU SAID PARTY LEADERS ARE AFRAID OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>FOR INSTABILITY THAT A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP WOULD ENTAIL. </p><p>HE SAID HE HIMSELF BELIEVES A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP IS NOT </p><p>NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY; INSTEAD, A </p><p>CHANGE IN THE WAY OF THINKING WAS ESSENTIAL.  VIETNAM HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02151  02 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>NEVER HAD A HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY, HE STATED, AND THERE ARE </p><p>TIMES IN A COUNTRY\'S DEVELOPMENT WHEN A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM </p><p>IS INAPPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) DIEU SAID HE BELIEVED VIETNAM WOULD EVENTUALLY </p><p>DEVELOP A FREE MARKET ECONOMY AND A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.  HE </p><p>QUICKLY ADDED THAT A COUNTRY MIGHT TAKE MANY DIRECTIONS ON </p><p>THE ROAD TO A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM, HOWEVER.  HE SAID HE </p><p>WOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO PREDICT WHAT VIETNAM\'S NEXT STEPS </p><p>WOULD BE, BUT ADDED, "WE ARE ALREADY EMBARKED ON A NON- </p><p>REVERSIBLE TREND TOWARD ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORM."  HE </p><p>SAID THE GREATEST HOPE FOR FURTHER REFORM IN VIETNAM IS THE </p><p>FRESH OUTLOOK AND DYNAMISM OF VIETNAM\'S YOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH NGUYEN XUAN OANH </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) REES, GUNDERSON AND CONGENOFF MET WITH NGUYEN XUAN </p><p>OANH AT HIS OFFICE IN HCMC ON AUGUST 14.  OANH WAS DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE IN SOUTH VIETNAM </p><p>FROM 1963-67, AND WAS ACTING PRIME MINISTER FOR A SHORT </p><p>TIME IN 1965-66.  IN THE LATE 1970\'S HE RE-EMERGED AS AN </p><p>ADVISOR FOR TO VO VAN KIET.  CURRENTLY, HE IS PRESIDENT OF </p><p>N.X. OANH ASSOCIATES, A BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT & FINANCE </p><p>CONSULTING AGENCY IN HCMC.  OANH, WHO IS IN HIS LATE 70\'S </p><p>OR EARLY 80\'S, RECEIVED A BA IN ECONOMICS AT THE KYOTO </p><p>IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY IN JAPAN IN 1949 AND A PH.D. FROM </p><p>HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN 1954.  LIKE PHAN DINH DIEU, OANH IS </p><p>NOT A COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER, BUT IS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL PRESIDIUM OF THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL FATHERLAND FRONT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02151  02 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>12. (C) OANH TOLD THE STAFFDEL THAT AFTER 1975, THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT PLACED HIM UNDER HOUSE ARREST FOR NINE MONTHS </p><p>UNTIL THEY DECIDED HE WAS A "HARMLESS TECHNOCRAT."  HE SAID </p><p>HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WRITING FOR THE "TIN SANG" ("MORNING </p><p>NEWS") NEWSPAPER, AND THAT MANY OF HIS ARTICLES WERE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM AND OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES.  HE SAID THAT IN 1978, VO VAN </p><p>KIET (THEN COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY FOR HO CHI MINH CITY) </p><p>SUMMONED HIM TO HIS OFFICE.  OANH RECOUNTED THAT KIET </p><p>ORDERED HIM TO STOP HIS PUBLIC NEWSPAPER CRITICISMS, BUT </p><p>ALSO SAID HE FOUND THE IDEAS IN OANH\'S ARTICLES THOUGHT </p><p>PROVOKING AND WISHED TO DISCUSS THEM FURTHER.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>OANH, THUS BEGAN A CONFIDENCE THAT CONTINUED AS OANH </p><p>ADVISED KIET ON MONETARY AND FISCAL MATTERS EVEN AFTER KIET </p><p>WENT TO HANOI IN 1988, EVENTUALLY BECOMING PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) OANH SAID THAT DURING THE 1980\'S, HE ADVOCATED </p><p>PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF CAPITAL AND OF ENTERPRISES.  HE </p><p>RECOUNTED THAT PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL DO MUOI ONCE ASKED </p><p>HIM, "BUT HOW CAN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS OWN A BANK?"  OANH </p><p>SAID THAT CURRENT LEADERS STILL SUFFER FROM THE OLD </p><p>COMMUNIST MINDSET, AND THAT IS WHY THE SCOPE OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR IS STILL LIMITED IN VIETNAM.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THREE YEARS EARLIER, THE GOVERNMENT DISBANDED </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF HEAVY INDUSTRY AND REPLACED IT WITH SEVERAL </p><p>CORPORATIONS.  "BUT THE CAPITAL FOR THESE CORPORATIONS </p><p>STILL COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT," HE SAID, "AND THE </p><p>MANAGEMENT IS STILL DIRECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT."  HE SAID </p><p>VIETNAM SHOULD GIVE UP ALTOGETHER THE NOTION OF STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES IF IT WANTS ITS ECONOMY TO WORK. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02151  02 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>14. (C) REES ASKED OANH IF HE THOUGHT ECONOMIC REFORM COULD </p><p>PROGRESS WITHOUT POLITICAL REFORM.  OANH SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM HAD ALREADY "COME IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR </p><p>OF ECONOMIC REFORM," ALBEIT AT A VERY SLOW PACE.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT SEVERAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES ARE NON-PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS.  HE SAID HE KNEW MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF A "LOYAL OPPOSITION, AS IN ENGLAND."  HE </p><p>FURTHER SAID, "WE ALL, INCLUDING NONG DUC MANH AND THE </p><p>OTHERS, BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN </p><p>VIETNAM IN 10-15 YEARS."  THEN HE ADDED THAT THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY WOULD MANAGE THE TRANSITION SO THE RESULTING MULTI- </p><p>PARTY SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE WHAT OUTSIDERS MIGHT EXPECT.  IT </p><p>WILL BE A POLITICAL SYSTEM UNIQUE TO VIETNAM, HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) REES NOTED THAT MANY OF THE THINGS OANH SAID </p><p>SOUNDED SIMILAR TO THINGS DISSIDENT NGUYEN DAN QUE HAD SAID </p><p>IN THE PAST, BUT QUE ENDED UP IN PRISON FOR HIS COMMENTS. </p><p>OANH ADMITTED THAT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN WHAT YOU CAN AND </p><p>CANNOT SAY IS VERY FUZZY.  OANH SAID HE NEVER ADVOCATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02151  03 OF 03  310844Z </p><p>OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT, BUT INSTEAD CRITICIZED </p><p>POLICIES IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY.  "IF ONE CRITICIZES, ONE </p><p>SHOULD ALSO OFFER PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS.  IT IS AS IMPORTANT </p><p>HOW YOU SAY THINGS, AS IT IS WHAT YOU SAY," HE EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) THE STAFFDEL DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR </p><p>THIS MESSAGE BEFORE DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
