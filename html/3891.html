<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G-TIP, EAP/BCLTV, AND DRL </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, PREL, SMIG, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE GOVERNMENT REPORTS TO THE USG ON </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOB is prepared to act on human </p><p>trafficking, but has not put together programs that will </p><p>fully treat the problem.  In a report presented to the </p><p>Embassy in August, the GOB acknowledges the problem facing </p><p>Burma and lays out the legislative, enforcement, training, </p><p>and preventive measures it has taken to deal with </p><p>trafficking.  Unfortunately, the report is incomplete, with </p><p>little discussion of such key issues as the GOB\'s funding of </p><p>anti-trafficking activities, its cooperation with destination </p><p>countries, and its handling of repatriated victims of </p><p>trafficking.  Our conclusion: our message on trafficking has </p><p>gotten through.  The GOB is concerned and is prepared to act, </p><p>but has not put together programs that are anywhere near </p><p>commensurate with the scale of the problem here.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Political Commitment </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to the GOB report, Burma is committed to </p><p>dealing with trafficking.  It established the Myanmar </p><p>National Committee on Women\'s Affairs (MNCWA) in 1996 </p><p>following the Fourth World Conference on Women and assigned </p><p>that committee responsibility for trafficking issues in </p><p>Burma.  The Committee\'s patron is Secretary One Khin Nyunt, </p><p>whose wife also serves as head of the Committee\'s Education </p><p>Group.  MNCWA working committees have also been organized at </p><p>the state, division, district, and township levels. </p><p>According to the report, there are now 324 MNCWA township </p><p>working committees in Burma; i.e., one in each of the </p><p>nation\'s townships. </p><p> </p><p>National Plan of Action and National Initiative </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) MNCWA also adopted in 1997 a National Plan of Action </p><p>for Trafficking in Women and Children.  That plan calls for </p><p>an assessment of trafficking in Burma, formation of a </p><p>national task force, a program of national workshops, </p><p>training for concerned officials, rehabilitation of victims </p><p>of trafficking, and the distribution of educational materials </p><p>on trafficking.  In 2000, MNCWA adopted a National Initiative </p><p>on the Trafficking of Women and Children, which includes </p><p>preventive, protection, enforcement, prosecution, and </p><p>reintegration strategies.  Copies of both documents are </p><p>attached to the government\'s report. </p><p> </p><p>Legal Framework </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) There are no specific human trafficking laws in </p><p>Burma, according to the report.  However, there are laws </p><p>which can be applied in cases of trafficking.  These include </p><p>the 1993 Child Law, which includes provisions against the </p><p>sale, abuse, or exploitation of children; the 1949 </p><p>Suppression of Prostitution Act, which prohibits any efforts </p><p>to force or entice a woman into prostitution; and the Penal </p><p>Code which forbids kidnapping and any effort to "convey any </p><p>person beyond the limits of the Union of Myanmar without that </p><p>person\'s consent."  The report also notes that the Supreme </p><p>Court issued Directive No. 1/01 on February 2, 2001 regarding </p><p>punishments for human traffickers.  Copies of the relevant </p><p>laws are attached to the report. </p><p> </p><p>Monitoring the Borders </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Burma\'s immigration and emigration controls are </p><p>tight, according to the report.  On the Thai border alone, </p><p>there are 23 checkpoints run by the Police, Immigration </p><p>Supervisory Board, and the Customs Department.  During the </p><p>period May 2000 to June 2002, the report states, 22,208 men, </p><p>women, and children were prevented from crossing the border </p><p>"in order to prevent them from becoming involved in nefarious </p><p>activities, including sexual exploitation."  Approximately </p><p>9,000 of these people were women.  According to the report, </p><p>no legal action was taken against any of those who were </p><p>turned back; rather, they were counseled on the dangers of </p><p>illegally working abroad and sent back to their homes.  The </p><p>report also notes that women between the age of 16 to 25 are </p><p>absolutely prohibited from crossing the border unless </p><p>accompanied by a legal guardian. </p><p> </p><p>Law Enforcement </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Many traffickers have also received long sentences. </p><p>According to the report, between 1999 and July 2002, Burma\'s </p><p>courts have given 104 human traffickers prison sentences </p><p>ranging from 3 to 14 years. </p><p> </p><p>Preventive Measures </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The GOB has put a special focus on education, </p><p>according to the report.  Between 1999 and June 2002, 10,822 </p><p>village-level seminars were held by MNCWA and/or NGOs to </p><p>educate poor families to the dangers of trafficking.  In Mon </p><p>State, eastern Shan State, and Kayin State, these seminars </p><p>were carried out in cooperation with the United Nations </p><p>Inter-Agency Project on Trafficking in Women and Children in </p><p>the Mekong Sub-region (UN-IAP). </p><p>Protection of Victims </p><p>8. (SBU) The report asserts that victims of trafficking are </p><p>not treated as criminals.  It also states that there are </p><p>rehabilitation centers, and Vocational Training Centers for </p><p>Women in Yangon, Mandalay, Myeik, and Kengtung, and Women\'s </p><p>Development Centers in Yangon and Mandalay.  According to the </p><p>report, legal has been taken only against those found guilty </p><p>of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Root Causes </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The report argues that the main causes of </p><p>trafficking are poverty and ignorance and marshals all of the </p><p>government\'s statistics on development to demonstrate concern </p><p>for those issues.  In particular, it notes that the </p><p>government has established twelve training centers since 1992 </p><p>in towns adjacent to Burma\'s borders.  Altogether, these </p><p>centers have provided vocational training to 10,128 girls and </p><p>women over the past decade. </p><p> </p><p>International Cooperation </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Burma is a signatory to the 1950 Convention for the </p><p>Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of the </p><p>Prostitution of Others.  It is also a party to the Convention </p><p>on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and to </p><p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In addition, the </p><p>GOB has become a regular participant in regional and </p><p>bilateral meetings on trafficking (15 in all) since 1997 and </p><p>has cooperated with the UN-IAP on programs to raise awareness </p><p>and build NGO and government capacity in regard to </p><p>trafficking problems. </p><p> </p><p>Non-Governmental Organizations </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) According to the report, Burma has enlisted the </p><p>support of NGOs like the Myanmar Red Cross Society, the </p><p>Auxiliary Fire Brigade, the Myanmar Maternal and Child </p><p>Welfare Association, and the Myanmar Women Entrepreneurs </p><p>Association in the fight against trafficking.  As an example, </p><p>it notes that the Maternal and Child Welfare Association has </p><p>implemented a literacy campaign for 410,000 women in remote </p><p>areas, conducted vocational classes, and extended </p><p>micro-credit loans amounting to nearly 150 million kyat over </p><p>the past decade. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Assessment of the Report </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The MOFA report is obviously intended to put the </p><p>best face on the GOB\'s counter-trafficking efforts and is, </p><p>unfortunately, packed with a variety of facts and figures </p><p>from GOB programs that are, at best, tangentially related to </p><p>the trafficking.  It is also short of some key statistics. </p><p>While it provides more information than needed on the number </p><p>of pencils and notebooks distributed under various programs, </p><p>it does not provide any significant information on the </p><p>resources that the GOB has specifically allocated to its </p><p>program on human trafficking.  It also provides little </p><p>information regarding the number of trafficking victims it </p><p>has actually assisted or repatriated from neighboring </p><p>countries.  In support of its claim that the Government is </p><p>committed to the international fight against trafficking, it </p><p>details the international meetings it has attended and </p><p>agreements it has signed.  However, it fails to provide any </p><p>significant information on its cooperation with Thailand or </p><p>other destination countries.  Similarly, it provides a lot of </p><p>very specific information on government-affiliated NGO </p><p>programs for women, but does not even hint at any </p><p>coordination with the international NGOs in Burma that are </p><p>working on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Oddly, the report gives only passing mention to </p><p>what we consider the most effective anti-trafficking activity </p><p>in the country, the United Nations Inter-Agency Project </p><p>(UN-IAP) on Trafficking in Women and Children in the Mekong </p><p>Sub-region.  This small but active project has pushed hard </p><p>for GOB inter-agency coordination and action on trafficking </p><p>issues, and has created a program for multi-sectoral </p><p>"service-provider" training (i.e., police, immigration, law, </p><p>and social welfare workers, among others).  Since August </p><p>2001, it has held three training workshops for 100 key </p><p>personnel from the police, immigration, health, and education </p><p>services.  The UN-IAP has also actively sought improved </p><p>interaction among international NGOs, GOB personnel, regime </p><p>affiliated NGOs, and others that need to be involved to </p><p>effectively address human trafficking challenges in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) In spite of these weaknesses, it is clear that the </p><p>Government has focused more attention on trafficking in </p><p>persons this year than it has in the past.  In what appears </p><p>to be a direct response to the Embassy\'s Trafficking in </p><p>Persons Report, the Government met with Embassy officials </p><p>earlier this year to determine what is needed to comply with </p><p>TIPS criteria.  Since these meetings, the Government has </p><p>initiated an information campaign to highlight the perils of </p><p>trafficking.  An MNCWA delegation, headed by Secretary One </p><p>General Khin Nyunt\'s wife, has also conducted highly </p><p>publicized visits to border regions to meet with women in an </p><p>effort to discourage them from falling victim to unscrupulous </p><p>traffickers.  The state-controlled press is also running </p><p>almost daily stories on trafficking victims that authorities </p><p>have intercepted, counseled, and returned to their families. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) These activities are a step in the right direction. </p><p> They demonstrate that the Government is aware of the need to </p><p>act against human trafficking, and they serve to heighten </p><p>public awareness of the potential dangers of trafficking. </p><p>However, they need to be further reinforced by effective </p><p>action specifically targeted at traffickers.  Right now, many </p><p>of the trafficking "busts" described in the newspapers appear </p><p>to be of men and women who are simply attempting to migrate </p><p>(albeit illegally) to Thailand, not trafficking victims. </p><p>Reportedly, only a fraction of the illegal Burmese migrants </p><p>to Thailand are trafficking victims, i.e., people who have </p><p>been deceived, coerced, or forced into working conditions </p><p>they did not choose.  The rest are simply happy to be there, </p><p>and out of Burma, whatever their employment status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Finally, the government\'s heavy-handed approach to </p><p>interdicting all illegal migrants has the potential to </p><p>actually drive people into the hands of traffickers.  This is </p><p>particularly true of the government\'s ban on exit visas for </p><p>women from 16 to 25 who are not accompanied by their legal </p><p>guardian.  For such women, the only recourse is often a </p><p>trafficker. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) In short, it is apparent that the government is </p><p>making an effort to address concerns about human trafficking. </p><p> MNCWA\'s national action plan is a good plan.  It is based on </p><p>international models and we will continue to push the </p><p>government to implement it.  However, the government\'s </p><p>approach does have some rough edges.  It needs to be more </p><p>tightly focused on traffickers specifically.  Other aspects </p><p>of the approach need to be beefed up, particularly in regard </p><p>to cooperation with destination countries and the </p><p>repatriation and reintegration of victims.  Fortunately, </p><p>UN-IAP and a few international NGOs are already working here </p><p>and should prove important allies in bringing the government </p><p>closer to a complete and effective response to its current </p><p>problems with trafficking in persons. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
