<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000861 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, DRL/PHD, CA/OCS/ACS/WHA, AND DS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SNAR, KCRM, KJUS, CASC, ASEC, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: LA CEIBA PRISON RIOT LEAVES 69 DEAD AND MANY </p><p>OTHERS WOUNDED </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 TEGUCIGALPA 1755 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: On April 5 a riot in El Porvenir prison, located </p><p>just outside the Caribbean port city of La Ceiba, Honduras, </p><p>left 69 dead and 39 wounded.  Many of the dead were gang </p><p>members from Mara 18, one of Central America\'s largest gangs. </p><p> According to press reports, the riot broke out when a </p><p>scuffle between inmates turned deadly after Mara 18 gangs </p><p>members with weapons attacked non-gang member prisoners, who </p><p>retaliated with weapons.  The non-gang inmates then </p><p>reportedly proceeded to lock the gang members in their cell </p><p>block and start a fire in the cell block, which killed over </p><p>thirty gang members.  Prison authorities had previously </p><p>confiscated some weapons in what was apparently not an </p><p>effective search of the prison.  No AmCits were reported </p><p>among the victims.  Post notes that Honduran prisons are </p><p>known for their poor conditions and lax security.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. On April 5 a riot in El Porvenir (The Future) prison, </p><p>located just outside the Caribbean port city of La Ceiba, </p><p>Honduras, left 69 dead (66 men and three women) and 39 </p><p>wounded. According to press reports, the riot broke out </p><p>around 10 a.m. shortly after visiting hours, when a scuffle </p><p>between inmates turned deadly after Mara 18 gangs members </p><p>produced four pistols and a number of machetes and attacked </p><p>non-gang member prisoners.  (Prison authorities had </p><p>previously confiscated some weapons in what was apparently </p><p>not an effective search of the prison.)  Hundreds of regular </p><p>prisoners then reportedly brandished weapons of their own, </p><p>including smuggled grenades, and proceeded to attack Mara 18 </p><p>members.  The facility, which holds 1,600 inmates is a </p><p>low-security prison farm where suspects facing drugs, </p><p>weapons, rape, and assault charges are held while they await </p><p>trial. </p><p> </p><p>3. Of the 69 killed during the riot, 61 were Mara 18 gang </p><p>members.  According to press reports, at least half of those </p><p>died from smoke inhalation after the cell block where they </p><p>were trying to take refuge was locked and then set ablaze by </p><p>other non-gang inmates.  The fire department was reportedly </p><p>unable to enter the prison to put out the fire due to </p><p>gunfire.  The press has reported allegations that some of the </p><p>inmates were shot and killed by prison guards during the </p><p>riot.  Also included among the victims were three women </p><p>visiting the prison at the time of the uprising and five </p><p>regular prisoners.  In the past some AmCits awaiting trial </p><p>have been temporarily detained at El Porvenir but none were </p><p>present when the riot broke out on April 5. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment:  Security at El Porvenir is notoriously lax. </p><p>Weapons and drugs are common, and in many instances interned </p><p>gang members control whole cell blocks.  Reftel and the Human </p><p>Rights Report both describe the poor conditions in Honduran </p><p>prisons.  The GOH is currently investigating the incident, </p><p>including allegations that prison guards, with the collusion </p><p>of a privately run prison store, helped smuggle weapons into </p><p>the prison.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
