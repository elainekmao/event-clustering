<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PTER, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: DEPUTY SECRETARY VISITS WAR-RAVAGED JAFFNA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5 b, d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AFTER IT IS CLEARED, THIS CABLE WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE </p><p>SAME ADDRESSEES AS THE OTHER REPORTING MESSAGES RELATED TO </p><p>THE DEPSEC\'S SRI LANKA VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The Deputy Secretary and his delegation </p><p>visited the Jaffna peninsula for two and a half hours during </p><p>his one-day visit to Sri Lanka, August 22.  The delegation </p><p>visited a U.S. demining site and a front line position where </p><p>Sri Lankan army troops and the LTTE face off, and met with </p><p>four Tamil civic leaders to get their views on the ceasefire. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Immediately after landing at Colombo\'s international </p><p>airport, the Deputy Secretary, his delegation, the Ambassador </p><p>and an embassy team immediately flew to Jaffna aboard a Sri </p><p>Lankan Air Force AN-32.  After landing at Palaly Air Force </p><p>Base on Jaffna peninsula, the group transferred to Sri Lankan </p><p>Air Force Bell helicopters and flew immediately to </p><p>Chavakatcheri.  This small city, formerly with a population </p><p>of about 10,000, was devastated by artillery and small arms </p><p>fire from both the Sri Lankan Army and the LTTE in the year </p><p>2000.  Virtually the entire population departed and </p><p>subsequently became internally displaced persons (there are </p><p>800,000 IDPs in Sri Lanka).  The Deputy Secretary\'s group </p><p>drove through the devastation enroute to a demining site on </p><p>Chavakatcheri\'s outskirts.  State\'s PM Bureau\'s quick </p><p>reaction demining force, led by Don Smith, escorted the </p><p>Deputy Secretary and his delegation around the site and </p><p>conducted a demonstration of demining techniques.  The QRDF </p><p>has cleared almost 700 mine and UXO from this site in the </p><p>past three months. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Deputy Secretary and his delegation then flew to </p><p>a front-line position on the eastern side of the Jaffna </p><p>peninsula at Muhamalai.  The group was shown the Sri Lankan </p><p>Army\'s defense perimeter by Commanding Officer General D. </p><p>Fonseka.  The front-line position is about 400 meters from </p><p>the LTTE\'s forces and also serves as a crossing point for </p><p>civilians traveling to and from the Jaffna peninsula. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Deputy Secretary and his delegation flew from </p><p>Muhamalai into Jaffna thereafter to meet a small group of </p><p>Tamil civic leaders.  The meeting occurred at the home of </p><p>Jaffna\'s Catholic Bishop.  The Deputy Secretary met with Dr. </p><p>Ambalavanar, a surgeon; Professor Sitrampalam; a university </p><p>professor; Ms. Sivachandran, a women\'s activist; and Mr. </p><p>Gopalakrishnan, a university student.  The Deputy Secretary </p><p>expressed to the four Tamils the United States\'s fervent wish </p><p>for peace in Sri Lanka and asked for their assessment of the </p><p>situation.  He heard from these four activists common themes </p><p>about the current situation:  that the LTTE is the sole </p><p>representative of the Tamil people; that the LTTE was driven </p><p>to violence only after more moderate Tamil leaders were </p><p>doublecrossed by successive governments in Colombo; that the </p><p>Tamils want peace but only if they are assured a very </p><p>substantial degree of self rule; and that Tamils want the </p><p>U.S. to be even-handed.  In the latter regard, Dr. </p><p>Ambalavanar asserted that the U.S. should be an impartial </p><p>broker between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government.  The </p><p>Deputy Secretary politely rejected the assertion, saying that </p><p>the U.S. strongly supported peace but could not broker a deal </p><p>because the USG has labeled the LTTE a foreign terrorist </p><p>organization.  He concluded the short meeting by assuring the </p><p>Tamil activists that the United States sincerely wished for </p><p>peace, supported the Norwegian efforts at facilitation and </p><p>was prepared to offer financial assistance for reconstruction </p><p>of Sri Lanka\'s northeast once the final peace deal is </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) At the conclusion of the meeting, the Deputy </p><p>Secretary was greeted by a gaggle of reporters outside the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Bishop\'s residence.  He responded to two questions before he </p><p>and the delegation choppered back to Palaly for their onward </p><p>flight to Colombo.  The remainder of the Deputy Secretary\'s </p><p>program has been reported in septels. </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
