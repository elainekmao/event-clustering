<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000808 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, JO, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND METROLOGY LOOKS </p><p>TO IMPROVE, HARMONIZE NATIONAL STANDARDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 RIYADH 8282 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (sbu) SUMMARY: The Jordan Institute of Standards and </p><p>Metrology (JISM) has been working hard since its creation </p><p>in 1995 to develop comprehensive product standards that </p><p>conform with international norms and support Jordan\'s WTO </p><p>commitments.  At the same time, JISM is currently </p><p>evaluating offers to implement an International Product </p><p>Conformity Certification Program and perform pre-shipment </p><p>inspections, a program designed to cover gaps in Jordan\'s </p><p>current standards regime. We have raised USG concerns about </p><p>such a program, and JISM has expressed a willingness to </p><p>cooperate with us to address USG concerns.  Since JISM will </p><p>be a key player in developing GOJ positions in the WTO on </p><p>standards issues, a strong relationship with JISM will help </p><p>cement GOJ support for USG proposals in relevant WTO </p><p>committees, and will help encourage them to take a </p><p>leadership role among developing country WTO members on </p><p>standards issues.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>JISM STRUCTURE, RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (u)  The Jordan Institute of Standards and Metrology </p><p>(JISM) is a quasi-governmental institution established in </p><p>1995.  It replaced the Jordanian Directorate of Standards </p><p>(JDS) which was founded in 1972. JISM is financially and </p><p>administratively autonomous.  It is governed according to </p><p>Jordan\'s Standards and Metrology Law number 22 of the year </p><p>2000. The Minister of Industry and Trade chairs JISM\'s </p><p>Board of Directors, which consists of 15 appointed members, </p><p>including 10 members from the GOJ and 5 members who are </p><p>appointed by private sector bodies (Royal Scientific </p><p>Society, Federation of Jordanian Chambers of Commerce, a </p><p>representative of Jordan\'s Chambers of Industry appointed </p><p>by the Minister of Industry and Trade, National Consumer </p><p>Protection Society, and Jordan Society for Quality). </p><p>Appointments are for a two-year term, renewable once. </p><p> </p><p>3. (u)  JISM\'s main objectives are to harmonize Jordan\'s </p><p>standards with international norms in accordance with WTO </p><p>commitments and to ensure equal treatment for all imports </p><p>with regards to standards issues. Under this umbrella, JISM </p><p>focuses on protecting Health, Safety and Environment; </p><p>Enhancing competitiveness; and coordinating Jordan\'s role </p><p>in the TBT Agreement.  Health, Safety and Environmental </p><p>standards are obligatory, while standards relating to </p><p>JISM\'s other priorities are considered voluntary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (u)  JISM has six primary functions: issuance of </p><p>standards; inspection of imports and domestically produced </p><p>goods; accreditation of labs and inspection bodies; </p><p>certification of products and issuance of the Jordan </p><p>Quality Mark in accordance to a benchmark combining the ISO </p><p>9000 and Jordan\'s standards; establishment of the National </p><p>Metrology Scheme; and creation of an information center. </p><p> </p><p>5. (u)  JISM has 24 permanent technical committees that </p><p>draft standards at the request of JISM.  The drafting </p><p>process goes through several stages of review, where all </p><p>stakeholders, including the private sector, have a chance </p><p>to express their opinions on proposals for new standards or </p><p>amendment of existing standards. Standards are implemented </p><p>once JISM\'s Board of Directors approves them. JISM can </p><p>adopt international standards or those of other countries </p><p>and implement them in Jordan if it is deemed that they meet </p><p>Jordan\'s requirements.  For example, Jordan uses American </p><p>standards for the steel and construction industry, the </p><p>Codex Alimentarius for the food industry, and ISO for </p><p>systems. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>PRE-IMPORT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (sbu)  JISM is currently evaluating offers from various </p><p>consultants and organizations to implement an International </p><p>Product Conformity Certification Program and perform pre- </p><p>shipment inspections on goods exported to Jordan (reftel). </p><p>Dr. Ahmed Thouqan Al-Hindawi, JISM\'s Director General, told </p><p>us that a final decision to adopt the program has already </p><p>been taken in principle but that a provider has not yet </p><p>been chosen due to the large number of proposals received </p><p>by interested service providers. Emboffs noted in a meeting </p><p>with Hindawi on January 22 that the USG had some concerns </p><p>about whether or not such a system would be compliant with </p><p>WTO rules.  Hindawi said he feels there is still time to </p><p>comment on the program and indicated JISM\'s willingness to </p><p>cooperate with the U.S. on this issue. He also gave us a </p><p>copy of the programs instructions (forwarded to NEA/ARN and </p><p>USTR via pouch). </p><p> </p><p>7. (sbu)  Hindawi noted that the program is designed to </p><p>cover a gap in Jordan\'s standards regime, where a main </p><p>challenge is the lack of qualified inspection labs for many </p><p>imported goods (he mentioned specifically new and used </p><p>autos, auto parts, tires, and children\'s toys).  Hindawi </p><p>conceded that Saudi Arabia is shifting away from its </p><p>similar program. Nevertheless, he said he feels the Saudis </p><p>have benefited from its implementation in the past, where </p><p>it complemented the lack of suitable inspection facilities. </p><p>He noted that Saudi Arabia is now self sufficient in that </p><p>area and can afford to replace pre-shipment inspection with </p><p>local inspection as a result of investing heavily in the </p><p>creation of new testing facilities (investments that, he </p><p>hinted, Jordan could not afford). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Ministry of Health Holding-off on its Own System </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8. (sbu)  Jordan\'s Ministry of Health planned to implement </p><p>its own requirement of legalizing export documents of food </p><p>related items by the Jordanian Embassy at the source </p><p>country. The Ministry originally targeted September 1, 2002 </p><p>for this requirement to go into effect; the new requirement </p><p>was briefly enforced from January 1, 2003. This had delayed </p><p>at least one US product, a shipment of Fruit Granulated </p><p>Sugar from the US company Savannah Foods Industrial to the </p><p>Jordanian company United Confectionery. According to Dr. </p><p>Ahmed Barmawi, Director of Safety and Health at the </p><p>Ministry, the new requirement is on hold until JISM </p><p>finalizes its program by March of this year. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (sbu)  As Jordan\'s authority on product standards and on </p><p>SPS and TBT issues, JISM will be a key player in </p><p>implementation of the kingdom\'s WTO commitments, as well as </p><p>development of GOJ positions in the WTO on future standards </p><p>issues. As we continue to work with Jordan to take up a </p><p>leadership role among the developing world in the WTO, a </p><p>strong relationship with JISM will help us to coordinate </p><p>our approaches on future SPS and TBT issues.  Dr. Hindawi </p><p>has expressed a strong desire to develop relationships with </p><p>U.S. standards organizations like NIST, ASTI, and the CPSC </p><p>to enable JISM to adopt standards as close as possible to </p><p>American norms wherever feasible.  Hindawi stated in </p><p>particular that JISM had worked with the AMIR program in </p><p>the past, and he expressed JISM\'s interest in continuing </p><p>that relationship.  The Embassy and AID mission will follow </p><p>up on Hindawi\'s request. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
