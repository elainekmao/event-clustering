<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000773 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, E, D, EB AND PMAT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/17/13 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: (S)  UAEG FINANCIALLY OVEREXTENDED </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF)  Senior UAEG officials have told the </p><p>Ambassador on several occasions recently that the </p><p>UAE is facing serious cash-flow problems.  The </p><p>basic problem is that the UAE has traditionally </p><p>funded its fiscal deficits (which can be as much as </p><p>15 percent of GDP) out of income received from </p><p>large overseas investments.  In some years (such as </p><p>1996) the return on those investments exceeded </p><p>income from oil.  But with the UAE\'s overseas </p><p>investments realizing negative real returns </p><p>(authoritative sources say post-9/11 governmental </p><p>portfolio investment losses ran as high as 30-40 </p><p>billion usd), the UAE is having to tighten its </p><p>belt.  Unfortunately, controlling spending is </p><p>proving quite difficult.  Expenditures, </p><p>particularly on social services (health, </p><p>education), is increasing as a function of a </p><p>growing population and higher citizen expectations. </p><p>At the same time, assistance commitments to worthy </p><p>causes (Pakistan, Jordan, Afghanistan, etc.) </p><p>continue to mount and senior shaykh spending on </p><p>prestige projects (Shaykh Sultan bin Zayid\'s Lulu </p><p>Island project, the new GCC conference and resort </p><p>center, etc.) are proving hard to switch off.  We </p><p>have heard the same concerns regarding cash-flow </p><p>across all levels of UAE officialdom, leading us to </p><p>conclude that this is not just poor-mouthing in </p><p>advance of an expected U.S. request for financial </p><p>assistance in funding an Iraq contingency.  Our </p><p>requests for future financial assistance from the </p><p>UAE will need to be both judiciously chosen as well </p><p>as particularly well-supported if we are to </p><p>overcome the leadership\'s prevailing budgetary </p><p>concerns.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Beyond the representations by senior </p><p>officials such as de facto Foreign Minister Hamdan </p><p>bin Zayid, there are numerous other signs of a </p><p>fiscal crunch: </p><p> </p><p>--  A senior expat banker says Abu Dhabi\'s subsidy </p><p>to Dubai has been delayed for several weeks because </p><p>of cash-flow problems; </p><p> </p><p>--  The Finance Department Undersecretary with day- </p><p>to-day responsibility for budget issues says the </p><p>government is seeking to defer non-essential </p><p>projects because of its fiscal overhang; </p><p> </p><p>--  Several senior UAE military personnel have told </p><p>U.S. contractors that money is exceptionally tight </p><p>right now and is expected to remain tight through </p><p>FY 2004; </p><p> </p><p>--  The managing director of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Investment Authority (ADIA -- the repository of the </p><p>bulk of the UAE\'s overseas governmental </p><p>investments) told us that his organization has had </p><p>to defer certain requests from the government for </p><p>cash because of an unwillingness to sell off </p><p>depressed equities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  ADIA and Abu Dhabi Finance Department </p><p>officials note that managing the expectations of </p><p>the leadership with regard to income and rates of </p><p>return has been difficult -- particularly after the </p><p>fantastic returns of the 1990s.  The ADIA managing </p><p>director commented that a real return of 5-6 </p><p>percent would be outstanding in the current </p><p>environment, vice returns in the 1990s of 15-20 </p><p>percent per annum.  One well-connected banker </p><p>stated that while the UAE still has significant </p><p>assets, the drop in portfolio value combined with </p><p>the cash-flow crunch because of reduced returns has </p><p>created a very real sense of anxiety on the part of </p><p>the UAE leadership -- particularly Abu Dhabi Crown </p><p>Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayed, who controls the </p><p>purse strings and who is in any case not </p><p>particularly noted for his generosity.  The UAEG, </p><p>like most investors, is feeling the pinch, and with </p><p>some observers predicting oil prices likely to drop </p><p>sharply once Iraq\'s production is fully restored, </p><p>the medium-term outlook for government finances </p><p>here is decidedly bearish. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
