CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS EDMUND MCWILLIAMS, REASON, </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  A WESTERN DIPLOMAT WAS ABLE TO ENTER </p><p>CIPINANG PRISON, CLAIMING TO BE A RELATIVE OF A </p><p>PRISONER, AND MET BRIEFLY WITH A NUMBER OF PROMINENT </p><p>DISSIDENTS AND OTHER PRISONERS.  THE DIPLOMAT NOTED THAT </p><p>THE PRISONERS APPEAR TO BE USING THEIR TIME TOGETHER TO </p><p>SHARE POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES, NOT UNLIKE THE POLITICAL </p><p>CROSS-POLLINATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN SOME OF THE LESS </p><p>HARSH CAMPS IN THE SOVIET GULAG OR IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>ROBBEN ISLAND.  FRETILIN LEADER XANANA GUSMAO, A LEADING </p><p>FIGURE WITHIN THE PRISONER COMMUNITY, TOLD THE DIPLOMAT </p><p>THAT HIS VISION OF A FUTURE FOR EAST TIMOR INVOLVED A </p><p>PERIOD OF AUTONOMY FOLLOWED BY A VOTE BY EAST TIMORESE </p><p>ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A WESTERN DIPLOMAT, POSING AS A RELATIVE OF A </p><p>PRISONER IN JAKARTA\'S CIPINANG PRISON, USED THE OCCASION </p><p>OF NATIONAL DAY VISITS AUGUST 17 TO ENTER THE PRISON. </p><p>THE DIPLOMAT SOUGHT A MEETING WITH "WILSON," ONE OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS FROM THE PEOPLE\'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>(PRD) WHO WAS RECENTLY CONVICTED AND SENTENCED ON </p><p>DISSENT CHARGES.  WITH MEETINGS BETWEEN PRISONERS AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS TAKING PLACE IN A RELAXED </p><p>ATMOSPHERE WITHIN A COURTYARD IN THE PRISON, THE </p><p>DIPLOMAT WAS ABLE TO MEET AND SPEAK BRIEFLY WITH XANANA </p><p>GUSMAO, IMPRISONED LEADER OF THE FRETILIN RESISTANCE </p><p>FORCES OF EAST TIMOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GUSMAO APPEARED IN GOOD HEALTH AND GOOD SPIRITS. </p><p>GUSMAO HAS EMERGED AS A LEADER AMONG MANY PROMINENT </p><p>POLITICAL DISSIDENTS WHO ARE INTERNED AT CIPINANG </p><p>PRISON.  HE RECENTLY ORGANIZED A SOCCER MATCH BETWEEN A </p><p>TEAM OF POLITICAL DISSIDENTS AND COMMON CRIMINALS (THE </p><p>DISSIDENTS WON).  ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTS GIVEN TO THE </p><p>DIPLOMAT, THE DISSIDENTS SPEAK JOKINGLY OF THE CIPINANG </p><p>"PARLIAMENT" OR "UNIVERSITY," ALLUDING TO THE BROAD </p><p>POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE AMONG THE </p><p>PRISONERS.  THE DIPLOMAT NOTED THAT STUDENTS VISIT SOME </p><p>PRISONERS, SUCH AS IMPRISONED DISSIDENT SRI BINTANG </p><p>PAMUNGKAS, TO LISTEN TO HIS INFORMAL LECTURES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GUSMAO, WHO IS LEARNING ENGLISH, AND OTHER </p><p>PRISONERS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND </p><p>NEWSPAPERS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SMUGGLE OUT LETTERS AND </p><p>EVEN ARTICLES WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE.  THE PRISONERS </p><p>DEPEND HEAVILY ON FOOD SENT BY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES </p><p>INASMUCH AS PRISON FOOD IS SAID TO BE OF VERY POOR </p><p>QUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GUSMAO INDICATED TO THE DIPLOMAT THAT WHILE HE </p><p>WOULD WELCOME A CHANCE TO RETURN HOME TO EAST TIMOR, HE </p><p>IS OPPOSED TO THE NOTION THAT HE MIGHT BE RELEASED AND </p><p>GO INTO EXILE.  GUSMAO REFUSED REQUESTS BY THE DIPLOMAT </p><p>AND BY JOURNALISTS (ALSO PRESENT ON NATIONAL DAY) TO </p><p>PROVIDE ANY READOUT ON HIS JULY 16 DINNER WITH NELSON </p><p>MANDELA.  HE ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF </p><p>THE UN SPONSORED EAST TIMOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN LISBON AND </p><p>JAKARTA BUT EXPRESSED SOME HOPE FOR PROGRESS THROUGH </p><p>THAT MECHANISM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GUSMAO DID SHARE HIS VIEWS WITH THE DIPLOMAT </p><p>REGARDING A SOLUTION FOR EAST TIMOR.  HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVED THE SHAPE OF A FINAL SOLUTION WOULD INVOLVE </p><p>SOME FORM OF AUTONOMY FOR FOUR TO FIVE YEARS AND THEN A </p><p>VOTE BY THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR ON THEIR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  THE INTERACTION AMONG THE NON-CRIMINAL </p><p>PRISONERS IS REMINISCENT OF ACCOUNTS OF LIFE IN SOME OF </p><p>THE LESS HARSH PRISONS IN THE SOVIET GULAG OR ON ROBBEN </p><p>ISLAND IN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE PRESIDENT MANDELA SPENT </p><p>MUCH OF HIS LIFE.  AS IN CIPINANG THOSE CAMPS SAW A RICH </p><p>CROSS POLLINATION OF POLITICAL IDEAS AND STRATEGIES </p><p>AMONG PRISONERS.  WE NOTE AS WELL, THAT SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>PRISONERS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT BEING MIXED WITH </p><p>HARDENED CRIMINAL PRISONERS WHO OFTEN FUNCTIONED AS </p><p>SPIES FOR THE PRISON ADMINISTRATION.  TYPICALLY, ONE </p><p>CRIMINAL IS PLACED WITH THREE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN </p><p>FOUR-PERSON CELLS.  XANANA REPORTEDLY HAS A PRIVATE </p><p>CELL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HARVEY </p><p></p></div>
