(U) Local papers reported on July 17 that the </p><p>Federal Supreme Court ruled sponsors cannot withhold </p><p>the passports of their employees -- a common practice </p><p>among employers in the UAE.  The Court held that a </p><p>passport is a personal document, granted by a </p><p>government to its citizens to travel.  A passport </p><p>cannot be taken away from its holder without a court </p><p>order. Following the Court decision, Ministry of </p><p>Interior Undersecretary Major General Shaykh Saif bin </p><p>Zayed Al-Nahyan wrote in a letter to the Ministry of </p><p>Labour and Social Affairs, "It is not allowed to </p><p>impound a passport by any party other than the </p><p>competent judicial authorities in accordance with the </p><p>law... impounding this document by any party in the </p><p>UAE without a court order is in violation of the law. </p><p>[The Ministry of Labour is] requested to send </p><p>instructions to all relevant parties in the country to </p><p>take the necessary measures against anyone who </p><p>impounds or seizes the passport of another person no </p><p>matter what the reasons and justifications are." </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Local interlocutors told Econoff that they </p><p>were surprised, but pleased, by the decision. They </p><p>stated the decision came out of the blue and is likely </p><p>to benefit low-income workers. Though holding </p><p>passports is a widespread phenomenon, some Western </p><p>executives do not surrender their passports to their </p><p>employers when working in the UAE. However, laborers </p><p>and workers in blue-collar jobs generally do </p><p>relinquish their passports because they lack leverage. </p><p>The embassy contacts expect the UAE market for fake or </p><p>forged passports to shrink over time as workers hold </p><p>on to their passports. One local attorney told Econoff </p><p>that he would immediately start informing U.S. and </p><p>western businesses that they should not keep their </p><p>employees\' passports, whereas in the past he </p><p>recommended it as a local business practice. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: The Court decision and follow-up </p><p>statement by the Interior Ministry are welcome </p><p>developments. It will take time for the decision to </p><p>have a meaningful practical impact and it is unclear </p><p>what sanctions sponsors will face for retaining </p><p>passports, but the decision is nevertheless a very </p><p>positive step forward for workers. In the long-term, </p><p>controlling their own passports will create bargaining </p><p>leverage for workers and likely result in better </p><p>treatment and wages. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
