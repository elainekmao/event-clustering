(C) SUMMARY: During a January 8 conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas </p><p>acknowledged ECOWAS diplomatic efforts in Cote d\'Ivoire had </p><p>lost steam due to ECOWAS Chairman Wade\'s erratic </p><p>statesmanship, the lethargy of President Gbagbo and lack of </p><p>focus of Togolese leader Eyadema in his role as mediator </p><p>between the GOCI and the MPCI.  Chambas believed France </p><p>originally hoped its call for a Paris Summit would roust </p><p>ECOWAS from inaction. When ECOWAS leaders failed to </p><p>respond, the French decided to proceed with the Summit. </p><p>Chambas noted President Obasanjo had signaled thumbs down </p><p>on deploying Nigerian peacekeepers on Iviorien soil; </p><p>Chambas hoped Obasanjo would play a more active diplomatic </p><p>role now that he had secured his party\'s renomination. </p><p>Chambas did not believe member-states would commit </p><p>additional soldiers to allow ECOWAS to increase the size of </p><p>the proposed peacekeeping force.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a January 8 dinner conversation at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Mohammed </p><p>Ibn Chambas shared his views on the Ivoirien peace process. </p><p>According to Chambas, dissonance among ECOWAS Heads of </p><p>State was severely impeding the organization\'s efforts to </p><p>forge a diplomatic solution and to get a peacekeeping force </p><p>on the ground. Chambas particularly criticized ECOWAS </p><p>Chairman Wade. Chambas said the Chairman\'s penchant for </p><p>off-the-cuff statements confused and irritated Wade\'s </p><p>colleagues. Because Wade was the ECOWAS Chairman, his </p><p>statements were perceived to be official policy when in </p><p>fact they were no more than his private musings. Wade\'s </p><p>most recent transgression was to call for a UN peacekeeping </p><p>force. Chambas said that Wade\'s call for the "blue helmets" </p><p>not only came as a surprise but it also complicated ongoing </p><p>efforts to coordinate the deployment of an ECOWAS force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Chambas contended Wade\'s unilateralism had </p><p>undermined the Contact Group and Eyadema\'s efforts as </p><p>mediator.  At the December 15 summit in Kara, President </p><p>Obasanjo took Wade to task for being a lone ranger and not </p><p>using his position as ECOWAS Chairman to lead and </p><p>coordinate with his colleagues. Obasanjo criticized Wade </p><p>for being less than supportive of Eyadema\'s efforts, noting </p><p>that Wade\'s public statements questioning the utility of </p><p>the Lome mediation had humiliated Eyadema needlessly and </p><p>that poor relationship between the two leaders most active </p><p>in the peace process was impeding progress. Obasanjo also </p><p>asserted that Wade had stepped out of line when, at the </p><p>beginning of the crisis, he sent his Foreign Minister to </p><p>Abidjan with an alternative peace plan almost immediately </p><p>after the Contact Group had left.  Obasanjo chided Wade for </p><p>following this dismal precedent for a relationship with the </p><p>Contact Group.  When the Heads of State reached Abidjan, </p><p>Obasanjo continued his blunt diplomacy. At their airport </p><p>meeting, he told Gbagbo, "you have a problem and your </p><p>problem is us!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Chambas had hoped that Obasanjo\'s intervention at </p><p>Kara signaled the Nigerian\'s more active engagement; he </p><p>also hoped it would push Wade and Eyadema to mend their </p><p>rift.  Unfortunately neither has happened.  Enmeshed in the </p><p>business of his hard-fought presidential re-nomination, </p><p>Obasanjo forgot Cote d\'Ivoire. Because Obasanjo was not </p><p>there to scold them and with no other ECOWAS leader to fill </p><p>that void, Wade and Eyadema regressed to their relationship </p><p>of cold indifference with occasional antagonism. Now that </p><p>Obasanjo has secured his party renomination, Chambas hoped </p><p>Obasanjo might devote more time to Cote d\'Ivoire.  If so, </p><p>he expected the Nigerian leader to continue his efforts to </p><p>bring peace among the ECOWAS leaders, seeing the end of </p><p>their competition as a precursor to ECOWAS playing a </p><p>sufficiently constructive role in the peace process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Chambas felt Wade\'s insistence on having a "global" </p><p>peace agreement between the GOCI and the three rebel groups </p><p>before deploying a peacekeeping force was handicapping his </p><p>efforts.  He believed the fighting had to stop before real </p><p>negotiations on a political solution could begin.  While </p><p>Senegal has deployed a 21-man headquarters unit and the </p><p>French are transporting Senegal\'s 170-man combat team to </p><p>CDI, it remains to be seen whether Wade will allow </p><p>Senegalese soldiers to actively participate in monitoring </p><p>operations without a formal agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Emphasizing that Wade was not totally responsible </p><p>for the sub-region\'s inertia, Chambas claimed that Eyadema </p><p>was ill suited for the role of mediator.  Eyadema did not </p><p>grasp that time was of the essence and that bringing peace </p><p>grew more difficult with each passing day. Instead, Eyadema </p><p>was content to keep the talks on the slow track, at one </p><p>point forecasting the talks could last months. Eyadema </p><p>reveled in the press coverage and attention; meetings were </p><p>often replete with protocol and frills but short on </p><p>substance. The Togolese leader seemed to be using the </p><p>meeting as a vehicle to enhance his domestic image rather </p><p>than forge genuine progress toward an Ivoirien peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Chambas believed Gbagbo suffered from similar </p><p>desultoriness.  Gbagbo did not understand that delay </p><p>advantaged the rebels not Abidjan. The longer the rebels </p><p>controlled the North the more they could consolidate power, </p><p>the more accustomed to leadership they would become. Their </p><p>willingness to cede control would diminish as a function of </p><p>time.  If the current situation persists, the de facto </p><p>partition of Cote d\'Ivoire could become an accomplished </p><p>fact. For instance, Chambas noted that significant trade </p><p>between the rebel-held areas and neighboring states was </p><p>occurring.  Chambas hoped Gbagbo would not let himself be </p><p>captive to regime hard-liners who favored the military </p><p>option; according to Chambas, Gbagbo needed to become more </p><p>active in talking to the rebels and opposition political </p><p>leaders to discuss the issues associated with national </p><p>reconciliation and expanding the political space and </p><p>participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Chambas said that neither Malian President Toure nor </p><p>Burkina\'s Campaore have been active players recently. </p><p>Wanting to get involved, Toure had hosted the talks between </p><p>the Gbagbo and Campaore; hopes that the talks would be the </p><p>vehicle to begin a dialogue to resolve bilateral </p><p>differences were quickly dashed; the talks rambled and were </p><p>inconclusive.  Toure blamed Gbagbo for letting a golden </p><p>opportunity slip because he was unfocused and vague at the </p><p>meeting.  At least for now, Toure has decided not to waste </p><p>more political capital on Gbagbo until the Ivorien shows </p><p>more seriousness.  Meanwhile Chambas surmised that Campaore </p><p>is relatively comfortable since attention has shifted from </p><p>him and accusations of complicity have dwindled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Chambas expressed his hope that the Paris peace </p><p>talks would prove fruitful.  He believed the only way to </p><p>find a political solution to the crisis was to bring all of </p><p>the important actors to the table.  Specifically, he noted </p><p>that former President Bedie, former Prime Minister </p><p>Ouattara, and General Guei\'s political heir, presumably his </p><p>son, must be included for the process to be worthwhile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Chambas did not expect member states to increase </p><p>their troop contributions at this time.  He said the force </p><p>commander, Senegalese Brigadier General Papa Khalil Fall, </p><p>and his staff were planning for 1,300 troops. Chambas </p><p>discounted rumors of a Senegal augmentation, stating that </p><p>his latest information was that Senegal would not deploy </p><p>more than 250 soldiers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Chambas further noted that Nigerian soldiers would </p><p>not be joining the ECOWAS force any time soon.  Obasanjo </p><p>had decided against sending troops due to domestic </p><p>political considerations.  His opponents would make it a </p><p>campaign issue and opposition in the National Assembly </p><p>would try to block his request.  (NOTE: The Nigerian </p><p>constitution requires that Obasanjo seek Assembly approval </p><p>for the deployment.  END NOTE.)  Chambas said the GON could </p><p>not seriously consider deploying troops to Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>until after the April elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>WHO WILL BE THE NEXT ECOWAS CHAIRMAN </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Despite Wade\'s erratic performance, Chambas thought </p><p>Wade would be re-elected as Chairman at the ECOWAS Summit </p><p>later this month. The rotation should go to an Anglophone </p><p>country and Gambia\'s Jammeh had been lobbying for the </p><p>position. Jammeh visited Obasanjo in December to ask for </p><p>his support. Chambas said Obasanjo\'s response fell far </p><p>short of an endorsement with Obasanjo simply telling the </p><p>Gambian he was not opposed to Jammeh seeking the </p><p>Chairmanship. Chambas did not think Jammeh would garner </p><p>much support and felt Presidents Kufuor and Kabbah would be </p><p>better choices if Wade\'s return somehow was blocked. </p><p>Liberia\'s Taylor was out of the question. Chambas said, </p><p>however, that Kuofor would not lobby for the position but </p><p>would serve if drafted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>TROUBLE IN TOGO </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Finally, the discussion turned to recent events in </p><p>Togo.  Chambas was troubled by the recent change to Togo\'s </p><p>constitution to allow Eyadema another term in office (REF </p><p>C).  He commented that over the course of the last year, </p><p>Eyadema had been signaling that he had no intention of </p><p>leaving office at the end of his term.  Chambas worried </p><p>that failure to include the Togolese opposition in the </p><p>political process would put Togo on the same path as Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Chambas is an old friend of the Ambassador\'s. </p><p>This was a relaxed evening and he was at ease.  Chambas </p><p>provided an interesting and very candid reading of the </p><p>internal frictions plaguing ECOWAS Heads of State and their </p><p>efforts in Cote d\'Ivoire.  Implicit in his analysis was </p><p>that he was not in a position to stop the internecine </p><p>squabbling.  He seemed to think that Obasanjo, if </p><p>sufficiently engaged, was best placed to serve this </p><p>function.  We agree.  The upcoming ECOWAS summit will be </p><p>important. Without a truce between the ECOWAS leader, they </p><p>will continue to squabble and their disaccord will hamper </p><p>the Ivoirien process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
