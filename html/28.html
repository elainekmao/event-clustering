<p>S E C R E T  STATE 038496 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:        PTER </p><p>SUBJECT:     INTERNATIONAL LINKS OF LARF </p><p> </p><p>REF:  1. ROME 1902, 2. STATE 31565  3. STATE 014859 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p></p><p>2.  REFTEL 1 RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND QUESTIONS </p><p>ABOUT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND LEBANESE TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS AS THEY MIGHT RELATE TO INVESTIGATON  OF </p><p>LADISPOLI SEVEN. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION MIGHT BE </p><p>USEFUL IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT WITH ITALIAN </p><p>MAGISTRATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AN ETA-LARF LINK.  ACCORDING TO ROME 1902 THERE IS </p><p>REASON TO SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE RECENT BOMB ATTACKS ON </p><p>TRAINS CLAIMED BY BASQUE FATHERLAND THE FREEDOM (ETA) </p><p>HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE LEBANESE ARMED </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) ON BEHALF OF ETA. </p><p></p><p>4.  WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THIS IS </p><p>BASED.  IN LATE 1984 THERE WERE THREE INCIDENTS IN WHICH </p><p>ETA WAS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT BOMBINGS ON RAILWAY </p><p>STATIONS OR NEAR RAILWAY TRACKS, BUT NOT AGAINST A </p><p>TRAIN.  TWO OF THESE WERE LOW-LEVEL EXPLOSIONS CAUSING NO </p><p>CASUALTIES AND LITTLE DAMAGE.  THE THIRD WAS A </p><p>BOOBY-TRAPPED DEVICE THAT KILLED SEVERAL CIVIL GUARDS, </p><p>BUT WAS CONSISTENT WITH PAST ETA ACTIONS. </p><p></p><p>5.  THE REFERENCE IN ROME 1902 MAY BE TO A FEBRUARY18, </p><p>1984 EXPLOSION AT URRUGNE NEAR THE FRENCH-SPANISH BORDER </p><p>THAT APPARENTLY WAS DESIGNED TO CAUSE A MID-COURSE </p><p>COLLISION BETWEEN TWO TRAINS, ONE BOUND FOR MADRID, THE </p><p>OTHER FOR PARIS.  THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO INJURIES OR </p><p>COLLISION, BUT ONLY A STROKE OF LUCK PREVENTED A MAJOR </p><p>CATASTROPHE.  CLAIM FOR THE ATTACK, HOWEVER, WAS NOT MADE </p><p>BY ETA BUT BY IPARRETARRAK ("MEN OF THE NORTH"), A FRENCH </p><p>BASQUE GROUP FIGHTING FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THREE </p><p>BASQUE-POPULATED FRENCH PROVINCES.  ALTHOUGH THE TWO </p><p>GROUPS ARE SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SIMILARITY OF </p><p>THEIR AIMS COULD CAUSE CONFUSION.  IN THE PAST ETA HAS </p><p>GENERALLY SHUNNED RELATIONS WITH IPARRETARRAK NOT WISHING </p><p>TO OFFEND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p>6.  THE FEBRUARY 18 INCIDENT WAS A POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE </p><p>VIOLENT ATTACK THAN USUAL IPARRETARRAK ACTIONS, AND IT </p><p>REPORTEDLY ANGERED SEVERAL JAILED IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS. </p><p>THE BOMBING, HOWEVER, APPARENTLY WAS THE WORK OF </p><p>IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS WHO (CLAIMED) THAT THEY HAD WARNED </p><p>FRENCH OFFICIALS ABOUT THE BOMB TEN MINUTES BEFORE IT </p><p>WENT OFF AND DID NOT INTEND TO CAUSE A TRAIN COLLISION. </p><p></p><p>7.  THE RED BRIGADES-LARF LINK.  AGAIN ACCORDING TO ROME </p><p>1902 LARF AND THE ITALIAN RED BRIGADES (RB) HAVE BEEN </p><p>PROVEN TO HAVE CONNECTIONS.  WE SUSPECT THAT THIS </p><p>ASSERTION IS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF LEAMON HUNT\'S </p><p>DRIVER WHO HAS IDENTIFIED MOHAMAD FAHS -- ONE OF THE ROME </p><p>SEVEN -- AS HUNT\'S ASSASSIN.  GIVEN THAT BOTH LARF AND </p><p>THE RB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR HUNT\'S DEATH, SOME </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIALS MAY BELIEVE THAT FAHS WAS CONNECTED </p><p>WITH LARF AND PERHAPS "CONTRACTED" BY THE RB TO KILL HUNT </p><p>-- HENCE A LARF-RB LINK.  ALTHOUGH IN NO POSITION TO </p><p>DISPROVE THIS THEORY, WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO CONFIRM THIS </p><p>LINK BASED UPON AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. </p><p></p><p>8.  THE LARF  ISLAMIC JIHAD LINK.  WE CANNOT YET VERIFY </p><p>THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN LARF AND ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD.  THE TWO GROUPS APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS </p><p>FROM SEPARATE ISLAMIC SECTS.  THEY ARE ACTIVE IN </p><p>DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND USE DIFFERENT MO\'S. </p><p></p><p>9.  "ISLAMIC JIHAD" IS APPARENTLY THE OPERATIONAL </p><p>COVERNAME USED BY ONE OR MORE PROIRANIAN RADICAL </p><p>LEBANESE SHIITE ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE GROUPS, GENERALLY </p><p>KNOWN UNDER THE RUBRIC HIZBALLAH (PARTY OF GOD) ARE </p><p>OFFSHOOTS OF THE MODERATE AMAL ORGANIZATION LED BY NABIH </p><p>BERRI.  SOME HIZBALLAH MEMBERS RETAIN TIES TO AMAL AND </p><p>MAY EVEN KEEP UP MEMBERSHIP IN IT. </p><p></p><p>10.  HIZBALLAH HAS PROBABLY BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL </p><p>MAJOR ANTI-WESTERN TERRORIST ACTS IN LEBANON.  THE </p><p>EARLIEST OF THESE, BEGINNING IN 1983, INVOLVED CAR BOMBS </p><p>LOADED WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES SUCH AS HEXOGER.  LATER </p><p>ATTACKS IN LEBANON CLAIMED BY ISLAMIC JIHAD ALSO INCLUDED </p><p>SHOOTINGS AND KIDNAPPINGS.  ALTHOUGH ANONYNOUS CALLERS </p><p>ALLEGED TO BE SPOKESMEN FOR "ISLAMIC JIHAD" HAVE CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS OUTSIDE LEBANON (MURDER OF </p><p>GENERAL OVERSSI, MINING OF RED SEA AND DECEMBER L983 </p><p>KUWAIT BOMBINGS) WE CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE THIS. </p><p></p><p>11.  LARF, ACCORDING TO MOST REPORTING, IS COMPOSED OF </p><p>LEFTIST/MARXIST LEBANESE AND/OR PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS </p><p>FORMERLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF PALESTINE.  LARF SEEMS TO OPERATE ON A </p><p>SMALLER SCALE THAN ISLAMIC JIHAD. </p><p></p><p>12.  INFORMATION ON MOHAMED FAHS.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION </p><p>ON MOHAMAD FAHS THAT IS NOT ALREADY KNOWN TO THE ITALIANS. </p><p></p><p>13.  THERE FOLLOWS A LIST OF LARF ACTIONS: </p><p></p><p>NOVEMBER 1, 1981 </p><p>ATTEMPTED SHOOTING OF CHRISTIAN CHAMPMAN US CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRS IN PARIS </p><p></p><p>JANUARY  8, 1982 </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF COL.

ALSO CLAIMED BY ARMENIANS AND RIGHTIST FRENCH GROUPS. </p><p>                                                . </p><p>FEBRUARY 1, 184 </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF LEAMON HUNT SINAI MULTINATIONAL FORCE </p><p>AND OBSERVERS DIRECTOR, IN ROME.
