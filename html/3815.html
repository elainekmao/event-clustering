<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005576 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ MOVES TO DISSOLVE THE JORDANIAN SOCIETY FOR </p><p>CITIZENS\' RIGHTS; FOUNDER WANTS TO WORK WITH GOJ TO AVOID </p><p>CLOSURE. </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 03620 </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY.  On September 19, Dr. Fawzi Samhoury, </p><p>President of the Jordanian Society for Citizens\' Rights </p><p>(JSCR), contacted Poloff to report that the Ministry of the </p><p>Interior informed him it had decided to "dissolve" the JSCR </p><p>within 30 days.  The GOJ contended in a letter to Samhoury </p><p>that the JSCR had refused to allow an inspection of its </p><p>financial records in each of the last three years. </p><p>Subsequently, local media coverage has reported that former </p><p>members of the JSCR have filed complaints against Samhoury </p><p>alleging, among other things, financial negligence.  On </p><p>September 24, PolCouns met with Nancy Bakir, Human Rights </p><p>Advisor for the Prime Ministry, and urged that the GOJ find </p><p>ways short of dissolution to address its concerns with the </p><p>JSCR, noting that precipitous action would appear to be </p><p>harassment.  Samhoury would like to work quietly with GOJ to </p><p>avoid closure.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND ON THE JSCR </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Dr. Fawzi Samhoury is a Palestinian-Jordanian dentist </p><p>living in Amman.  In 1998, he founded the JSCR and registered </p><p>it with the Ministry of the Interior.  Since its inception, </p><p>the JSCR has held meetings, organized conferences, written </p><p>reports, and issued statements regarding human rights issues </p><p>without any significant interference from the GOJ.  Unlike </p><p>some other human rights groups here, the JSCR is not </p><p>affiliated with a political movement and is independent of </p><p>the GOJ.  Samhoury is currently the embassy\'s most reliable </p><p>and trustworthy human rights contact. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR </p><p>ISSUES LETTER "DISSOLVING" JSCR </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  On September 19, Samhoury received a letter signed by </p><p>Minister of the Interior Qaftar Majali, which ordered the </p><p>JSCR to be dissolved "30 days from the issuance of this </p><p>letter."  In a September 23 meeting with Poloff, Samhoury </p><p>said that the IntMin contends that the JSCR is in violation </p><p>of the Charity and Societies Law of 1966, which requires </p><p>certain societies to allow the GOJ to inspect their offices </p><p>and to submit financial records.  Samhoury argues that a) </p><p>because the JSCR is classified as a "normal society", it is </p><p>not subject to the provisions cited in Majali\'s letter and </p><p>that b) the GOJ has never asked for such information before, </p><p>and therefore he should be given adequate notice and a chance </p><p>to comply before such punitive measures are implemented. </p><p>Samhoury reported that Majali had called Samhoury to his </p><p>office in July and "was very rude and disrespectful." </p><p>According to Samhoury, Majali questioned Samhoury on several </p><p>issues, including JSCR\'s support of Toujan Faisal (reftel), </p><p>and JSCR\'s reporting on Palestinians who have been "stripped" </p><p>of their passports through the GOJ\'s implementation of </p><p>disengagement laws. Now, Samhoury said, "he just wants us to </p><p>be finished." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HERE COMES THE SMEAR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Samhoury told Poloff on September 23 that he had </p><p>spoken informally with local reporters, who informed him that </p><p>the GOJ was going to orchestrate a smear campaign against </p><p>him.  (Note:  During this meeting at a local cafe, it was </p><p>clear that Samhoury was under surveillance).  Samhoury </p><p>appeared calm and patient, but is very upset with the action </p><p>by the IntMin.  Poloff told Samhoury to be patient, and to </p><p>work with his lawyers and fellow human rights advocates to </p><p>find a just solution. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Local press has reported that the GOJ has received </p><p>complaints from four former members of the JSCR, who are </p><p>accusing Samhoury of financial negligence (i.e. failing to </p><p>report money collected from unnamed sources).  Samhoury told </p><p>Poloff that a) these accusations are false; b) Samhoury was </p><p>never notified of any complaints, either by the complaining </p><p>members or the GOJ; and c) the GOJ letter notifying Samhoury </p><p>that the JSCR was going to be "dissolved" never mentioned </p><p>these complaints, although press reports indicate the </p><p>complaints were filed June 17.  In addition, local press </p><p>reports the GOJ has also accused Samhoury and the JSCR of </p><p>unlawful involvement in "regional" issues (i.e. stoking </p><p>Palestinian/Jordanian sensitivities).  Samhoury told Poloff </p><p>that this is untrue.  "I never conclude in any of my reports </p><p>that the government is biased against the Palestinians, but </p><p>my research indicates that most of the human rights </p><p>violations here occur against Palestinians.  Reporting the </p><p>facts does not make me guilty of damaging relations between </p><p>Palestinians and East Bankers," he said. </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>EMBASSY EXPRESSES CONCERN TO THE PM\'S OFFICE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On September 24, PolCouns and Poloff met with Nancy </p><p>Bakir, Human Rights Advisor at the Prime Ministry, to convey </p><p>serious USG concern over the plan to dissolve the JSCR and </p><p>urge the GOJ to find a less confrontational way to address </p><p>its concerns about the JSCR.  PolCouns cautioned against any </p><p>unwarranted action against an independent human rights </p><p>organization.  Bakir clearly took the point, and said that </p><p>Samhoury was a personal friend.  She said that she would send </p><p>a memorandum to the Prime Minister and IntMin about the </p><p>matter.  Perhaps, she said, someone in the GOJ is mad at </p><p>Samhoury, but if this is the case then it should be a matter </p><p>resolved easily. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL ACTIVISTS CIRCLE WAGONS </p><p>AROUND SAMHOURY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  On the evening of September 24, a group of local </p><p>activists held a meeting of support for Samhoury and the </p><p>JSCR.  Samhoury told Poloff that the most vocal supporter at </p><p>the meeting was the controversial former MP Toujan Faisal </p><p>(reftel).  Many of the group signed a letter to the IntMin </p><p>requesting that he reconsider his decision to "dissolve" the </p><p>society.  In general, Samhoury\'s supporters are taking the </p><p>position that the allegations by the IntMin can be resolved </p><p>within the society through their rules/bylaws and that there </p><p>is no need for the GOJ to shut Samhoury\'s group down. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The JSCR is one of only a few independent human </p><p>rights organizations in Jordan and until now, has been </p><p>allowed to do its work unfettered.  Post believes Samhoury is </p><p>a genuine human rights activist, objective in his reporting, </p><p>and is without a doubt supportive of Jordan and the Regime. </p><p>For now he has decided to remain patient and to try to work </p><p>with the GOJ to resolve the matter. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
