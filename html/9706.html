<p>UNCLAS ROME 003404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA KOTOK AND L/HRR K. GOROVE </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR HUGHES AND REICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO RIGHT TO FOOD BUREAU: FIRST READING OF </p><p>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE BUREAU OF THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (FAO) INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP (IGWG) </p><p>    FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD </p><p>IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY MET JULY 9-11 </p><p>AND JULY 15 TO DISCUSS THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE VOLUNTARY </p><p>GUIDELINES.  WHILE BUREAU MEMBERS AGREED TO FOCUS ON </p><p>NATIONAL ACTIONS AND PRUNE OUT MOST OF THE REFERENCES TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ACTORS IN THE GUIDELINES THEMSELVES, G-77 </p><p>MEMBERS FELT STRONGLY THAT AN "INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION" </p><p>MUST FIGURE SOMEWHERE IN THE TEXT -- POSSIBLY IN THE </p><p>PREFACE.  THE NEW DRAFT (WHICH DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN </p><p>AGREED DOCUMENT AND CONTAINS SECTIONS WHICH HAVE NOT YET </p><p>BEEN DISCUSSED) WILL BE WORKED ON FURTHER AT THE NEXT </p><p>BUREAU MEETING, SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 16-18 (WITH ONE </p><p>ADDITIONAL DAY BEFORE OR AFTER STILL TO BE DECIDED.) </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE BUREAU OF THE FAO IGWG FOR THE ELABORATION OF </p><p>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE </p><p>REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY MET JULY 9-11 AND JULY 15 TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.  THE </p><p>BUREAU HAD BEFORE IT A 23-PAGE DRAFT PREPARED BY THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT (E-MAILED TO IO/EDA JULY 3, 2003). BUREAU </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MEMBERS AGREED THAT THE FIRST DRAFT WAS LONG, REPETITIVE, </p><p>AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND.  BUREAU MEMBERS WORKED </p><p>PRODUCTIVELY ON A FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT, DELETING </p><p>LIBERALLY (THE CURRENT VERSION IS A GOOD 6 PAGES SHORTER) </p><p>AND AGREEING TO PRUNE OUT MOST REFERENCES TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ACTORS FROM THE GUIDELINES THEMSELVES.  G- </p><p>77 BUREAU MEMBERS INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT THEY WOULD </p><p>REVERT TO THE ISSUE, POSSIBLY UNDER A HEADING </p><p>    "INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK" IN THE PREFACE.  THE GROUP </p><p>AGREED TO DELETE THE ENTIRE SECTION ON "REMEDIES" AND </p><p>CONSIDERABLY SOFTEN THE "MONITORING" AND "NATIONAL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS SECTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE TEXT WHICH EMERGED FROM THE FIRST DRAFTING </p><p>SESSION (E-MAILED TO IO/EDA JULY 28) DOES NOT REPRESENT </p><p>AN AGREED TEXT.  IN FACT, THE BUREAU HAS STILL TO DISCUSS </p><p>SOME SECTIONS.  BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT SESSION IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER (SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 16-18, WITH AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL DAY EITHER SEPTEMBER 15 OR 19) THE BUREAU WILL </p><p>HAVE THE DOCUMENT TRANSLATED AND CIRCULATED TO CHAIRS OF </p><p>REGIONAL GROUPS SO THAT BUREAU MEMBERS MAY HAVE THE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF REGIONAL GROUP COMMENTS BEFORE THE NEXT </p><p>SESSION; THE SECRETARIAT WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE TEXT TO </p><p>NGOS PRESENT AT THE IGWG AND SUMMARIZE THOSE NGO COMMENTS </p><p>FOR THE BUREAU\'S INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  BUREAU MEMBERS WORKED CONSTRUCTIVELY AND WITH COMMON </p><p>PURPOSE.  NONETHELESS, THE GUIDELINES ARE STILL A LONG </p><p>WAY FROM THE PRACTICAL TOOL WHICH THE U.S. ENVISAGED IN </p><p>ITS STATEMENT TO THE IGWG. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR </p><p>WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO REVIEW THE CURRENT TEXT WITH A </p><p>VIEW TO STRENGTHENING THE SECTIONS ON FOOD SAFETY NETS </p><p>AND MARKETS.  END COMMENT.  TAMLYN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03404 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
