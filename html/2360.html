SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C ) SUMMARY:  WITH THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT NOW IN </p><p>PLACE, ZIMBABWE FIRMLY ON THE COMMONWEALTH\'S CMAG AGENDA </p><p>AND THE ELECTION DATE LIKELY TO BE ANNOUNCED BY JANUARY </p><p>10, WE ARE APPROACHING A KEY MOMENT IN THE LEAD-UP TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. IT DOES NOT APPEAR </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL BE DETERRED BY PRESSURES FROM </p><p>THE US, THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH OR SADC FROM HIS </p><p>DETERMINATION TO WIN THE ELECTION BY WHATEVER MEANS </p><p>NECESSARY.  IT IS INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, ELECTORAL </p><p>MANIPULATION AND POPULIST USE OF THE LAND ISSUE WILL </p><p>DELIVER A MUGABE\'S VICTORY IN THE FACE OF A DISASTROUS </p><p>ECONOMIC SITUATION AND GROWING FOOD SHORTAGES. </p><p>MOREOVER, AS LONGTIME ZANU-PF STRONGMAN EDDISON ZVOBGO </p><p>TOLD US, IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ZIMBABWEANS CAN BE BEATEN </p><p>INTO VOTING FOR MUGABE WHEN THEY NOW HAVE ANOTHER VIABLE </p><p>ALTERNATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C ) GIVEN THIS NEXUS OF DEVELOPMENTS, IT IS VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT WE BEGIN TO EXAMINE VARIOUS SCENARIOS IN </p><p>THE PRE- AND POST-ELECTION PERIODS AND PREPARE POLICY </p><p>TOOLS CALIBRATED FOR THE APPROPRIATE MOMENTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. (C ) CURRENT SCENARIO AND POLICY INSTRUMENTS </p><p> </p><p>(A) THE GOZ: NOTWITHSTANDING DOUBTS AMONG SOME SENIOR </p><p>ZANU-PF FIGURES AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE SEEMS DETERMINED TO COMPETE FOR AND TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00044  01 OF 03  070547Z </p><p>WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE WILL UTILIZE </p><p>VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND ELECTORAL MANUEVERS DESIGNED </p><p>TO REDUCE THE VOTE FOR THE OPPOSITION.  ZANU-PF, </p><p>NONETHELESS, WANTS THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY WHICH NORMALLY STEMS FROM AN ELECTION AND IS </p><p>PLANNING TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCES OF A CREDIBLE </p><p>PROCESS, INCLUDING LIMITED INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION AND </p><p>ELECTION DAY OR WEEK NORMALITY. </p><p> </p><p>(B) MDC AND CIVIL SOCIETY: UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC DEFINITELY INTENDS TO STAY IN THE RACE </p><p>AND THINKS IT CAN WIN DESPITE THE OBSTACLES.  MOST CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO REMAINING </p><p>FULLY ENGAGED IN THE LEGAL, ORGANIZATIONAL AND PUBLIC </p><p>EDUCATION FIGHTS TO MAKE THE ELECTION AS FAIR AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.(IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT LEGAL APPEALS TO </p><p>EXTEND VOTER REGISTRATION PERIOD AND TO FORCE THE </p><p>REGISTRAR TO TURN OVER REGISTRATION LISTS HAVE BEEN WON </p><p>AND MORE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE AMENDED CITIZENSHIP LAW </p><p>AND OTHER POTENTIAL ELECTION MANUEVERS ARE PLANNED.) </p><p> </p><p>(C ) INTERNATIONAL ROLE: THE US AND MANY EUROPEANS ARE </p><p>PROVIDING CRITICAL SUPPORT TO CIVIL SOCIETY AND OTHER </p><p>INDEPENDENT ZIMBABWEAN FORCES, INCLUDING LABOR, THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND ELECTION WATCHDOG </p><p>GROUPS. THE GOZ IS UNLIKELY TO PERMIT EU OR US </p><p>OBSERVERS, BUT COMMONWEALTH AND SADC-PF OBSERVERS COULD </p><p>STILL PLAY A USEFUL ROLE IF THEY CAN GET ON THE GROUND </p><p>AT LEAST THREE-TO-FOUR WEEKS PRIOR TO ELECTIONS. APART </p><p>FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM, IT </p><p>APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT SADC AS AN INSTITUTION, NIGERIA OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00044  01 OF 03  070547Z </p><p>THE AU WILL PLAY A HELPFUL ROLE IN PRESSING FOR FREER </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(D) POLICY INSTRUMENTS: IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAINTAIN </p><p>THE PRESSURE SO THAT ELECTION CONDITIONS NOT DETERIORATE </p><p>FURTHER, BUT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THE GOZ TO ALTER ITS </p><p>COURSE AS A RESULT OF ANY ADDITIONAL PRESSURES WE CAN </p><p>REALISTICALLY BRING TO BEAR.  JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, THE </p><p>US, OTHER INTERNATIONAL ACTORS, AND ZIMBABWEAN CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY MUST DO NOTHING TO UNDERMINE THE PROSPECTS OF </p><p>THE MDC FOR WINNING DESPITE THE OBSTACLES PLACED IN ITS </p><p>WAY.  FOR INSTANCE, ANY PRELIMINARY JUDGMENT WE RENDER </p><p>ON ELECTION CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT PROVIDE GROUNDS FOR </p><p>THE GOZ TO SHUT DOWN THE ELECTION PROCESS.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>WE NEED TO AVOID ANY MEASURES WHICH COULD GIVE THE GOZ </p><p>BASIS TO SHUT DOWN OUR SUPPORT FOR CSO\'S, INCLUDING </p><p>VISAS FOR TRAINERS, EXPERTS AND EMBASSY STAFF.  WE WILL </p><p>WISH TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH THE COMMONWEALTH, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA AND THE EU SO THAT WE ACT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN </p><p>HARMONY.  WE NEED TO ENGAGE WITH SADC AND NIGERIA TO </p><p>PREVENT THEM FROM UNDERMINING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES ON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO7741 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00044  02 OF 03  070548Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------5407A4  070548Z /38 </p><p>O 070443Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0648 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S KANSTEINER, P/DAS BELLAMY AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SR DIR FRAZIER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LIKELY SCENARIOS; POLICY TOOLS AND TIMING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00044  02 OF 03  070548Z </p><p>THE GOZ TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND TO ORGANIZE A MINIMALLY </p><p>CREDIBLE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C ) SCENARIO FOR SHARP DETERIORATION AND POLICY </p><p>RESPONSES </p><p> </p><p>(A) GOZ: IT IS NOT LIKELY, BUT POSSIBLE THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION COULD DETERIORATE SHARPLY PRIOR TO ELECTIONS, </p><p>MOST LIKELY IF THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT IT </p><p>STOOD TO LOSE, OR IF LOOMING FOOD SHORTAGES WERE TO </p><p>PRODUCE PUBLIC DISTURBANCES.  THE GOVERNMENT COULD </p><p>IMPOSE A STATE OF EMERGENCY, ALTHOUGH, EVEN THEN, THERE </p><p>IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>REMAINING IN OFFICE BEYOND APRIL 1.  THE GOZ COULD ALSO </p><p>SHUT DOWN THE OPPOSITION MDC OR ARREST ITS LEADERSHIP ON </p><p>THE PRETENSE OF ITS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES OR EVEN COMMISSION OFF-LINE ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS.  IN THE COURSE OF THE ELECTION </p><p>COUNT, THE ZANU GOVERNMENT COULD REACT TO AN APPARENT </p><p>OPPOSITION VICTORY BY INERRUPTING OR SHUTTING DOWN THE </p><p>PROCESS ON ONE OF A NUMBER OF PRETEXTS, NONE OF WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE CREDIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>(B) OPPOSITION, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE PUBLIC: OPPOSITION </p><p>AND CIVIL SOCIETY WOULD LIKELY BE FORCED UNDERGROUND </p><p>UNDER THESE SCENARIOS.  PENT-UP PUBLIC FRUSTRATIONS </p><p>WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO CIVIL DISTURBANCES. THE WILLINGNESS </p><p>OF SECURITY FORCES TO PUT DOWN THESE DISTURBANCES </p><p>VIOLENTLY WOULD BECOME THE KEY ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>(C ) INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE: THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00044  02 OF 03  070548Z </p><p>COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE US </p><p>WOULD NEED TO RESPOND RAPIDLY AND HARSHLY TO SUCH A </p><p>SCENARIO WITH THE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT </p><p>CANNOT STAND.  IF THE SITUATION REMAINED FLUID, WE WOULD </p><p>WISH TO COMMUNICATE TO SECURITY OFFICIALS THE </p><p>UNACCEPTABILITY OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL </p><p>REGIME AND ENCOURAGE THEIR COOPERATION IN A RETURN TO </p><p>LEGALITY.  IT WILL ALSO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HAVE </p><p>SOLID AND STRONG RESPONSE FROM SOUTH AFRICA, SADC AND </p><p>NIGERIA, AS WELL AS FROM UN SYG ANNAN AND THE UNSC. </p><p>UNDER THIS SCENARIO, FULL AND PUNITIVE PERSONAL </p><p>SANCTIONS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY AND SELECTED </p><p>ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C ) POST-ELECTION SCENARIOS </p><p> </p><p>(A) MDC VICTORY: IN THE EVENT OF AN MDC VICTORY, THE MDC </p><p>IS LIKELY TO WORK THROUGH EXISTING ZANU-PF AND SECURITY </p><p>SERVICE CONTACTS TO SEEK TO ASSURE THAT TSVANGIRAI CAN </p><p>TAKE OFFICE AND THAT HE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT IN </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO GOVERN.  MUGABE </p><p>HARD-LINERS CAN BE EXPECTED TO ATTEMPT TO BLOCK THIS BY </p><p>WHATEVER MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.  WE AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ACTORS WILL WANT TO SUPPORT TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE HIS VICTORY AND TO ENCOURAGE </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THE SECURITY FORCES TO ACCEPT THE OUTCOME. </p><p>IN VIEW OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FOOD CRISIS, IT WILL </p><p>BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE RAPID HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AND FAST-DISBURSING ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00044  02 OF 03  070548Z </p><p>(B) A MUGABE VICTORY IN A SERIOUSLY FLAWED ELECTION: A </p><p>MUGABE VICTORY, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY THE </p><p>FLAGRANT USE OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND ELECTORAL </p><p>MANIPULATION, IS A FORMULA FOR PERMANENT TRANSITION </p><p>CRISIS -- ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL.  REGARDLESS OF LIKELY </p><p>POLICY REVERSALS INTENDED TO APPEAL TO DOMESTIC </p><p>INVESTORS AND INTERNATIONAL DONORS, THERE IS LIKELY TO </p><p>BE NO REVERSAL OF ZIMBABWE\'S DECLINE.  UNDER THIS </p><p>SCENARIO, WE SHOULD PROCEED TO IMPLEMENT THE PERSONAL </p><p>TARGETTED SANCTIONS ENVISIONED IN ZDERA AGAINST A WIDE, </p><p>BUT CAREFULLY SELECTED LIST OF REGIME LEADERS, INCLUDING </p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE MANIPULATED THE A-2 LAND GRAB TO THEIR </p><p>PERSONAL BENEFIT.  WE SHOULD SEEK TO MAINTAIN A WORKING </p><p>RELATIONSHIP HERE, PARTICULARLY FOR THE ABILITY IT GIVES </p><p>US TO WORK WITH OTHER ZIMBABWEANS AND CONTINUE SOME </p><p>PROGRAMS OF SUPPORT FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE, E.G. </p><p>HIV/AIDS.
