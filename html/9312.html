<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KCRM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER GID HEAD CONVICTED IN BANK SCANDAL CASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 00687 B. AMMAN 00794 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Former General Intelligence Directorate (GID) head </p><p>Samih Battikhi was sentenced to 8 years in prison on July 10 </p><p>after being convicted of fraud and forgery charges, which </p><p>stem from a bank fraud scandal associated with Jordanian </p><p>businessman Majd Shamayleh (see reftels).  One Embassy source </p><p>said that when current GID head Sa\'ad Kheir ratified the </p><p>court\'s judgment, he reduced Battikhi\'s prison sentence to </p><p>four years.  GOJ prosecutors told the specially-convened </p><p>military tribunal that Battikhi had embezzled JD 17 million. </p><p>At least some of Battikhi\'s assets have been seized by the </p><p>GOJ. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Prosecuting Battikhi serves the dual purpose of </p><p>highlighting the GOJ\'s anti-corruption efforts while </p><p>underscoring to the public that no one is above the law, </p><p>including former senior GOJ officials.  Although the King may </p><p>issue a royal pardon to Battikhi before he serves out his </p><p>sentence, the message--which was generally well-received by </p><p>the public--has been made. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
