<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 02571 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, KPAL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQ KEEPS THREATENING TO SEND MISSILES </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EVERY DAY THE IRAQIS TURN OUT MILITARY </p><p>COMMUNIQUES THREATENING "SEVERE PUNISHMENT" AGAINST </p><p>IRAN FOR CONTINUING TO SHELL IRAQI BORDER TOWNS (TYPI- </p><p>CALLY ONLY DARBANDIKHAN, WHICH TODAY SCARCELY FITS THE </p><p>DEFINITION OFIA CIVILIAN TARGET).  WITH NEARLY THREE </p><p>WEEKS ELAPSING SINCE THE END OF THE MISSILE WAR, IT </p><p>SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT THE IRAQIS INTEND TO </p><p>DO NO MORE THAN KEEP THE IRANIANS AWARE THAT THEIR </p><p>"FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER" SHOULD THE IRANIANS TRY </p><p>ANYTHING BIG, ALTHOUGH THE VALUE OF THE IRAQI WARNINGS </p><p>IS GROWING INCREASINGLY HOLLOW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RELENTING YET IN THE STRIDENCY </p><p>OF IRAQI WARNINGS THAT IF THE IRANIANS DO NOT DESIST </p><p>IN SHELLING BORDER CITIES AND "VIOLATING THE CONDI- </p><p>IONS STIPULATED FOR THE HALT OF IRANIAN CITIES," </p><p>IRAQ WILL METE OUT "SEVERE PUNISHMENT" (CLEAR REFER- </p><p>ENCE TO RESUMPTION OF USE OF MISSILES).  THE ODD THING </p><p>LS THAT IN THE PAST WEEK THE IRAQI MEDIA HAVE MENTION- </p><p>ED ONLY TWO SUCH "BORDER CITIES"--DARBANDIKHAN (NEAR </p><p>HALABJA) EVERY DY, AND ON ONE OCCASION ABUL-KHASIB </p><p>(NEAR BASRA).  BOTH ARE ABANDONED AND BOTH SIT </p><p>ASTRIDE IMPORTANT HIGHWAYS CLOSE TO IRANIAN LINES </p><p>THAT ARE OBVIOUS TARGETS FOR IRANIAN ARTILLERY. </p><p>(INDEED, IT IS ESSENTIAL FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT </p><p>FOR IRAN TO TRY TO INTERDICT MOVEMENT ALONG BOTH </p><p>HIGHWAYS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS STRUCK THE SHIRAZ </p><p>REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX ON MAY 4.  THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT MILITARY COMMUNIQUE MADE IT CLEAR THAT </p><p>THEY INTEND TO CONTINUE HITTING SUCH ECONOMIC TARGETS </p><p>FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OF PARTICULAR NOTE, AS WE OBSERVE FROM FBIS </p><p>REPORTAGE OF IRANIAN BROADCASTS, IS THE FERVOR WITH </p><p>WHICH THE IRANIANS DENY STRIKING ANY CIVILIAN </p><p>TARGETS IN IRAQ--INCLUDING DENYING ANY SHELLING </p><p>OF DARBANDIKHAN.  OUR AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES TELL US </p><p>THAT TEHRAN IS JUST BEGINNING TO COME BACK TO LIFE </p><p>FULLY.  THEIR EMBASSY IN TEHRAN ASSESSES THAT THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE EXTREMELY KEEN TO PREVENT A RESUMPTION </p><p>OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE--UNTIL, THAT IS, IRAN FEELS </p><p>ON A TECHNOLOGICAL PAR WITH IRAQ AND CAN DELIVER </p><p>JUST AS STRONG BLOWS AGAINST BAGHDAD AS THE IRAQIS </p><p>CAN AGAINST TEHRAN.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS </p><p>HAVE ALSO BEEN KEEN TO DENY IRANIAN CLAIMS OF </p><p>IRAQI STRIKES ON IRANIAN BORDER AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ CONTINUES OFFICIALLY TO BUBBLE </p><p>OVER WITH PLEASURE AT THE VICTORY AT FAO AND THE </p><p>MIGHTINESS OF THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, NOW FOLLOWED BY </p><p>THE ABBAS MISSILE OF A CLAIMED EVEN LONGER STRIKING </p><p>POWER.  SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS MADE NO FEWER THAN FOUR </p><p>VISITS TO AN EXHIBITION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRY </p><p>COMMISSION, AND ON MAY 5 HE BESTOWED ON THE COMMIS- </p><p>SION\'S DIRECTOR--HIS SON-IN-LAW AND COUSIN HUSAYN </p><p>KAMIL (JUST PROMOTED FROM COLONEL TO BRIGADIER)-- </p><p>AND SEVERAL OF ITS STAFF "RAFIDAIN MEDALS FOR </p><p>DISTINGUISHED SERVICE."  IN VIRTUALLY EVERY HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL MILITARY MEETING SADDAM NOW HAS, HUSAYN KAMIL </p><p>IS PHOTOGRAPHED AT HIS SIDE, ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER- </p><p>IN-LAW AND COUSIN DEFENSE MINISTER ADNAN KHAYRALLAH. </p><p>THE BIG NEWS IN THE PRESS MAY 8 WAS THE OFFICIAL </p><p>DELIVERY BY PARTY NUMBER-TWO IZZAT IBRAHIM TO SADDAM </p><p>OF HIS LATEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT, A MINIATURE OF THE </p><p>HUSSEIN MISSILE FROM THE PEOPLE OF SALAH AL DIN </p><p>(TIKRIT) PROVINCE.  THE BIG NEWS ON MAY 9 WAS </p><p>SADDAM\'S PRESIDING OVER DISCUSSION OF FINAL DESIGNS </p><p>FOR A MONUMENT TO BE ERECTED AT THE BILAT AL-SHUHADA </p><p>SCHOOL, DESTROYED BY AN IRANIAN MISSILE OCTOBER 13, </p><p>AND HIS REVIEWING A HALL FULL OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS </p><p>"GIVEN TO HIM BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE SHOWING THEIR JOY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  SADDAM\'S MAY 1 INTERVIEW WITH AN EGYPTIAN </p><p>JOURNALIST SANA AL-SA\'ID, WAS FINALLY PUBLISHED MAY 6 </p><p>(SEE FBIS JNO70944).  SADDAM TYPICALLY PREFERS ARAB </p><p>TO NON-ARAB JOURNALISTS, PARTLY OUT OF NATIONALISM </p><p>AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY TEND TO ASK LESS DELICATE </p><p>QUESTIONS.  SANA AL-SA\'ID DID TRY A FEW INTERESTING </p><p>QUESTIONS, BUT SADDAM DOGGEDLY DODGED THEM.  SHE </p><p>TRIED TO GET HIM TO SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE ABOUT </p><p>HOW FAO IS A HARBINGER OF ARAB VICTORY OVER JERUSALEM, </p><p>BUT HE MEALY-MOUTHED ABOUT LACK OF ARAB UNITY AND </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH WORLD OPINION.  SHE TRIED TO GET HIM </p><p>TO CASTIGATE OMAN, QATAR, AND THE EMIRATES, BUT HE </p><p>DID NOT BITE.  SHE INSINUATED SUPERPOWER UNHELP- </p><p>FULNESS, BUT THERE WERE NO WORDS OF CRITICISM </p><p>FOR THE SOVIET UNION, AND HE EXCUSED U.S. NAVAL </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE GULF AS BEING LONGSTANDING AND, </p><p>IN ANY CASE, SOMETHING FOR WHICH IRAN IS ENTIRELY </p><p>TO BLAME.  HE REFUSED TO BLAME THE PLO FOR RAP- </p><p>PROCHEMENT WITH SYRIA.  HE LIED EFFUSIVELY ABOUT </p><p>HOW THE IRAQIS NOW RELY ON THEMSELVES FOR MOST </p><p>WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE DID CONTRADICTORILY ADMIT THAT "PURCHASES OF </p><p>SOVIET ARMS ARE STILL BIG." </p><p> </p><p>8.  ARAFAT, WHO ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD FROM DAMASCUS ON </p><p>APRIL 26, IS STILL IN TOWN, GETTING PUBLICITY FOR </p><p>HIS PROMINENCE IN SADDAM\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AND </p><p>IN MEETINGS WITH SADDAM ON APRIL 27 AND MAY 7.  BE- </p><p>TWEEN THESE DATES THERE WERE MEETINGS OF THE PLO </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE HIGHER COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>OCCUPIED LAND AFFAIRS.  PLO STATEMENTS AS PUBLISHED </p><p>IN THE BAGHPAD PRESS ARE MAINLY DEVOTED TO PRAISE OF </p><p>THE VICTORY AT FAO "LEADING TO VICTORY IN JERUSALEM." </p><p> </p><p>9.  SAUDI ARABIA\'S RUPTURE OF RELATIONS WITH IRAN </p><p>HAS BEEN A MAJOR SOURCE OF PRAISE AMONG EDITORIALISTS, </p><p>WITH A STRONG UNDERCURRENT THEME THAT OTHER ARAB </p><p>STATES MUST FOLLOW SUIT.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TAHA </p><p>YASIN RAMADAN, CARRYING SADDAM\'S LETTER OF PRAISE </p><p>FOR SAUDI ARABIA\'S TOUGH STAND AGAINST IRAN, MET </p><p>KING FAHD IN RIYADH MAY 6 AND MADE HIS SECOND UMRA </p><p>TO MECCA IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  IN THE SHORT TERM, THERE IS HOPE FOR </p><p>A CONTINUED LULL IN THE MISSILE WAR.  WHILE THE </p><p>IRAQIS GREATLY RELISHED THE DISRUPTION IN TEHRAN, </p><p>THEY ARE RESTRAINED BY COUNTERVAILING FACTORS. </p><p>BAGHDAD WAS ALSO DISRUPTED, EVEN IF TO A MUCH RE- </p><p>DUCED DEGREE THAN TEHRAN; BAGHDADIS WERE BEGINNING </p><p>TO BE VERY MUCH ON EDGE.  THE IRAQIS MAY HAVE </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT SUPPLY PROBLEMS; NO MATTER WHICH </p><p>REPORT ONE BELIEVES, IRAQ\'S SUPPLY OF MISSILES IS </p><p>NOT LIMITLESS.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, THE </p><p>IRAQIS MAY HAVE--OR SHOULD HAVE, BY ANY LOGIC-- </p><p>CALCULATED THAT MISSILES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AS A </p><p>DETERRENT IF NOT OVERUSED.  NOW THE IRANIANS </p><p>PAINFULLY KNOW WHAT THE IRAQIS CAN DO, AND TEHRAN </p><p>IS BEING REPOPULATED; HENCEFORTH, THE IRANIANS </p><p>WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE CAREFULLY ABOUT THEIR </p><p>ATTACKS ON THE GROUND OR WITH MISSILES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN THE LONGER RUN, THE PICTURE MAY NOT BE </p><p>SO HOPEFUL.  WE ARE IN A REGIONAL ARMS RACE, AND </p><p>IF THE IRANIANS ARE ABLE TO CATCH UP, A DEADLIER </p><p>MISSILE WAR MAY ULTIMATELY BE IN THE OFFING. IN </p><p>THIS RACE, THE IRANIANS HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE </p><p>OVER THE IRAQIS, NAMELY,  THAT BAGHDAD AND OTHER </p><p>IRAQI POPULATION CENTERS LIE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES </p><p>NEARER THE BORDER THAN DO MOST IRANIAN CITIES. </p><p>THE IRANIANS THEREFORE ONLY NEED SMALLER MISSILES </p><p>WHICH MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SPEEDIER PRODUCTION </p><p>IN GREATER QUANTITY, OR IN THE CASE OF MISSILES OF </p><p>SIMILAR SIZE AND PROPELLENT, THEY ARE ABLE TO </p><p>PACK IN MUCH MORE EXPLOSIVES.  EITHER PROSPECT </p><p>SHOULD GIVE THE IRAQIS PAUSE, AS THEY CONGRATULATE </p><p>THEMSELVES ON THEIR NEW MISSILES. </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
