<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NP/ECC KATHY CROUCH </p><p>ENERGY FOR SLD </p><p>USCS/INA FOR DHARRELL </p><p>ROME FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, ETTC, PREL, KSTC, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKS REJECT AGREEMENT ARTICLES; PROPOSE </p><p>CASE-BY-CASE WORK </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 29502 </p><p>     B. 02 ANKARA 7670 </p><p>     C. 02 STATE 165781 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary.  On March 31, the Turks objected to three </p><p>articles of our proposed Export Control and Related Border </p><p>Security Assistance (EXBS) Program agreement.  The articles </p><p>govern the status of personnel, claims, and inspections and </p><p>audits.  For the moment, we are at an impasse, and it appears </p><p>as though these three articles serve as a proxy for the GOT\'s </p><p>overall reluctance to conclude the agreement.  Turkey remains </p><p>eager to cooperation regarding non-proliferation, but would </p><p>like to work with us on a project-by-project basis, without </p><p>an overarching framework or agreement.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On March 31, MFA Disarmament Department Head Ibrahim </p><p>Yagli convoked polmiloff to respond to the US\'s proposed text </p><p>for an agreement "Regarding Cooperation to Facilitate the </p><p>Provision of Assistance for Non-Proliferation Purposes."  We </p><p>had presented our latest text to the Turks on September 30, </p><p>2002.  Polmiloff had subsequently lobbied Turkish Customs and </p><p>MFA on multiple occasions to dislodge a response.  Yagli said </p><p>that the GOT had examined our text in detail and had </p><p>concluded that articles III, IV, and V "were not in </p><p>conformity with Turkish legislation."  Therefore, the GOT </p><p>could not accept our text as it stands, absent action by the </p><p>Turkish Parliament.  Yagli did not hold out parliamentary </p><p>action as an option. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Yagli urged us to put an overarching agreement to the </p><p>side.  He said the GOT "on the whole attaches importance to </p><p>cooperation on non-proliferation issues."  However, he </p><p>proposed that the US and Turkey "continue cooperating with </p><p>purpose-oriented projects, but without a big, extensive </p><p>agreement."  He thought that the US seemed to be trying to </p><p>use a generic text, perhaps appropriate for other </p><p>circumstances, but for which Turkey did not see a need.  As </p><p>Yagli put it, Turkey is "ready to receive proposals on what </p><p>and how we can move forward." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Polmiloff asked Yagli if we could get a detailed </p><p>analysis of the legal obstacles to Turkey\'s accepting the </p><p>three articles.  Yagli replied that he would have to refer to </p><p>MFA\'s Legal Department to get specific information.  Noting </p><p>the MFA\'s understanding is that the US position on the </p><p>articles is "steady," he had not thought that we would want </p><p>the particulars of why the article were objectionable.  Yagli </p><p>recalled that in June 2002 Turkey had objected to these </p><p>specific provisions, but in September the US\'s </p><p>counter-proposal contained basically the "same articles." </p><p>Polmiloff pressed Yagli on whether, hypothetically, </p><p>modifications of the September text might make the agreement </p><p>acceptable to Turkey, but Yagli could not commit on whether </p><p>Turkey\'s reservations regarding the agreement, as opposed to </p><p>the articles, were firm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The three articles to which the Turks object are as </p><p>follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article III: Status of Personnel </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) Turkey shall accord civilian and military personnel of </p><p>the United States Government present in Turkey in connection </p><p>with United States assistance programs under this Agreement, </p><p>status equivalent to that accorded administrative and </p><p>technical personnel under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic </p><p>Relations of April 18, 1961. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to derogate </p><p>from the privileges and immunities granted to any personnel </p><p>under other agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article IV: Claims </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) Turkey shall, in respect of legal proceedings and claims, </p><p>other than contractual claims, hold harmless and bring no </p><p>legal proceedings against the United States and personnel, </p><p>contractors, and contractors\' personnel of the United States </p><p>for damage to property owned by Turkey, or death or injury to </p><p>any personnel in Turkey, arising out of activities pursuant </p><p>to this Agreement. </p><p>(b) Claims by third parties, arising out of the acts or </p><p>omissions of any employees of the United States or </p><p>contractors or contractors\' personnel of the United States </p><p>done in the performance of official duty, shall be the </p><p>responsibility of Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article V: Inspection and Audit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upon reasonable request, Turkey, or its relevant authorities </p><p>or entities subject to its jurisdiction, shall permit </p><p>representatives of the United States to examine that </p><p>utilization of any commodities, supplies, other property, or </p><p>services provided under this Agreement at sites of their </p><p>location or use; and to inspect or audit any records or other </p><p>documentation in connection with the assistance wherever such </p><p>records or documentation are located during the period in </p><p>which the United States provides assistance to Turkey and for </p><p>three years thereafter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Action Request:  Post requests the Department\'s </p><p>guidance on a response to Turkey\'s position.  In the meantime </p><p>we will follow up with MFA to try to nail down the legal </p><p>particulars of why articles III, IV, and V are not "in </p><p>conformity with Turkish legislation."  If the articles were </p><p>the only obstacle to signing the agreement, we doubt it would </p><p>have taken the Turks from September 2002 until March 2003 to </p><p>reach their position.  Our discussions with MFA and Turkish </p><p>Customs have consistently shown that the Turks are eager to </p><p>receive assistance and equipment, but are reluctant to agree </p><p>to an overall framework for the program.  Per Ref A, para 6, </p><p>Post understands that the Department\'s position is that </p><p>further equipment installation and "other significant EXBS </p><p>program projects" cannot go forward absent the GOT\'s signing </p><p>the proposed agreement.  We have communicated this fact to </p><p>the Turks. End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
