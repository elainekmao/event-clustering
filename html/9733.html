ON JULY 23 POLOFF DELIVERED REF A POINTS TO ALESSANDRO </p><p>BUSACCA, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>BUSACCA CAREFULLY REVIEWED THIS SECOND SET OF U.S. PRIORITIES </p><p>FOR THE 58TH UNGA (RESPONSE TO PART I CONTAINED IN REF B), </p><p>AND UNDERTOOK TO SHARE THEM BROADLY WITHIN THE GOI.  BUSACCA </p><p>ADDED THAT THE EU\'S 58TH UNGA PRIORITIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE </p><p>SHORTLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ON THE ICC, BUSACCA NOTED THAT, WHILE IN THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, ITALY MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WIDELY VARYING </p><p>MEMBER STATE OPINIONS WHILE STRIVING FOR CONSENSUS.  MANY EU </p><p>COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ITALY, STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ICC.  POLOFF </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT EXPERT-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS COULD ASSIST THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE EU IN REACHING A SOLUTION ALLOWING THE EU TO STATE </p><p>ITS POSITION ON THE ICC WHILE NOT BLOCKING CONSENSUS ON </p><p>RESOLUTIONS THAT BOTH SIDES SUPPORT.  BUSACCA DEMURRED ON </p><p>SPECIFICS, BUT AGREED ON THE NEED TO MINIMIZE CONFLICT OVER </p><p>THE ICC AT THE UNGA AND SAID THAT ITALY WILL WORK TOWARDS </p><p>THAT END. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TURNING TO EU VIEWS ON RESOLUTIONS REGARDING THE </p><p>ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, BUSACCA SAID ITALY IS WORKING TO </p><p>MODERATE THE LANGUAGE OF SUCH RESOLUTIONS AND TO ADD POINTS </p><p>RECOGNIZING RECENT POSITIVE STEPS.  HE CITED ONGOING ECOSOC </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, STATING THAT ITALY WAS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE IN DRAFTING A MORE BALANCED ANNUAL RESOLUTION ON </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF ISRAEL\'S PRESENCE IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  BUSACCA ALSO EXPRESSED ITALY\'S AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>DISCUSSION OF IRAQ SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN UP ON THE UNGA, BUT </p><p>REMAIN IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03426 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
