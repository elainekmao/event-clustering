<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000301 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY PRESSES AK ON ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 7987 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Ambassador delivered reftel points to Prime </p><p>Minister Gul January 9, emphasizing that any possible U.S. </p><p>financial assistance was conditional on continued </p><p>implementation of the economic reform program.  Embassy </p><p>delivered the same message January 9 and 13 to Treasury U/S </p><p>Oztrak and two influential AK parliamentarians.  PM Gul </p><p>assured the Ambassador that he understood the need for </p><p>reform, and that the government was not "populist."  Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak told us he had raised the need for "actions, not </p><p>promises" in his January 7 meeting with PM Gul, who </p><p>"completely understands."  Oztrak admitted, however, that </p><p>others in AK, including Party leader Erdogan, still needed </p><p>convincing.  Reflecting that, parliamentarians Reha Denemec </p><p>and Nazim Ekren agreed on the need to commit to a 6.5 percent </p><p>primary surplus now, but also said they hope to find </p><p>opportunities to reduce the surplus in the near future, </p><p>albeit "in consultation with the IMF."  They pointed to </p><p>Deputy PM Sener\'s January 11 statement of support for bank </p><p>reform as a positive step, but at the same time defended </p><p>amendments to the Public Procurement Law aimed at gutting the </p><p>authority of the procurement regulatory body. We, the IMF, </p><p>and the markets will need to maintain steady pressure on AK </p><p>to implement sound policies.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador delivered reftel points to Prime Minister </p><p>Gul on January 10, noting that the U.S. -- as a friend of </p><p>Turkey -- was concerned about economic policy slippage. </p><p>Ambassador reiterated that any potential U.S. financial </p><p>assistance would also require Turkish implementation of the </p><p>economic reform program.  The Prime Minister said his </p><p>government was committed to reform, would not succumb to </p><p>populism, and wanted to put Turkey\'s "house in order." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On January 10, we presented reftel points to Treasury </p><p>Undersecretary Faik Oztrak, who said he agreed fully with </p><p>them. "This is the message I gave to PM Gul.  The PM called a </p><p>meeting with economic ministers and agency heads on January 7 </p><p>after the disappointing Treasury auctions.  It was my first </p><p>meeting with him; I said the time for promises is over, we </p><p>need to show actions.  On the budget, we need to decide now </p><p>what to cut, and which taxes to raise in order to pay for the </p><p>increased social spending already announced and to reach the </p><p>6.5 primary surplus target.  " </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Oztrak continued that PM Gul understood right away, </p><p>and pushed for the fiscal savings measures announced January </p><p>8 (ref b). "The PM\'s decision marks a decisive move towards </p><p>implementing the program.  He is concerned about the economy </p><p>as I am."   However, Oztrak noted that this message still </p><p>needed to go to others in the Party, including Chairman </p><p>Erdogan and AKP parliamentarians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Oztrak\'s other key points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Following Oztrak\'s January 7 meeting with the PM, Gul had </p><p> telephoned the Danistay (administrative court) to urge </p><p>acceleration of deliberations on the pending Pamukbank case; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On the IMF Fourth Review, "we have a ways to go both on </p><p>finalizing the Letter of Intent for the 2003 program, and on </p><p>completing the outstanding conditions.  It will not be an </p><p>easy IMF review, but we have to finish the Review in </p><p>February."  Oztrak said he had told the GOT he need the </p><p>Fourth Review tranche ($1.7 billion) in February. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Treasury had drawn down its cash balance to meet the </p><p>January 8 debt redemptions to its domestic market.  Treasury </p><p>had then raised the cash balance through the $750 million </p><p>dollar-denominated external bond offering.  "if we proceed to </p><p>meet the outstanding Fourth Review conditions, and deliver a </p><p>credible LOI to the IMF, then we should have no problem in </p><p>our next big T-bill auctions on January 22.  Then our cash </p><p>balance should be restored to the TL 2.5 quadrillion level </p><p>(about $1.8 billion)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) We also delivered the same message to AK </p><p>Parliamentarians Nazim Ekren and Reha Denemec, both of whom </p><p>are close to AK Party Chairman Erdogan, in January 9 and </p><p>January 13 meetings.   (Both are accompanying Erdogan on his </p><p>trip to China this week.)  On fiscal policy, Ekren said AK </p><p>wanted to fulfill its pre-election promises to the </p><p>electorate, but now the Party understands that some of its </p><p>promises will have to be delayed.  Denemec said that State </p><p>Minister Babacan had over the weekend fully confirmed the </p><p>GOT\'s adherence to the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus. He </p><p>added, however, that this figure was not "the word of God," </p><p>and that it might be reduced in the near future, in </p><p>consultation with the IMF.  We stressed that announcing the </p><p>6.5 percent target, while progress, was insufficient; the GOT </p><p>also needed to announce further credible measures to achieve </p><p>it.  Denemec said much of the savings would be achieved by </p><p>reducing the outstanding public investment projects from </p><p>4,400 to 2,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On banking reform, Ekren said former bank owners were </p><p>lobbying Chairman Erdogan.  "Halis Toprak calls the Chairman </p><p>every week, trying to get permission to start a new bank.  We </p><p>listen only because he is important to the real sector" </p><p>(note:  Toprak formerly owned Toprak Bank and still owns </p><p>several factories, including a paper factor in SE Turkey.) </p><p>But Ekren also said he understood the importance of cleaning </p><p>up the banking sector and not giving new banking licenses to </p><p>persons who not only bankrupted their institutions at public </p><p>expense, but also owed the banking board substantial sums of </p><p>money.  Denemec called attention to Deputy PM Sener\'s January </p><p>11 statement calling on the Cukurova Group (former owner of </p><p>Pamukbank and majority owner of Yapi Kredi Bank) to pay its </p><p>debt to the banks in full.  Sener said the banking board\'s </p><p>actions were fair and legal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Denemec defended AK\'s plan to amend the public </p><p>procurement law, saying the law as originally passed was </p><p>unworkable.  He agreed that there is a damaging public </p><p>perception that the changes are intended to benefit AK-relate </p><p>firms, but he blamed this perception on media misinformation. </p><p>He also added that "laws themselves cannot change peoples\' </p><p>behavior" (implying that the construction firms lobbying for </p><p>GOT contracts would not be deterred by legal changes.) </p><p>Comment:  The IMF and World Bank say the proposed amendments </p><p>would reduce the law\'s scope from nearly 100 percent of GOT </p><p>procurement to about one-third, and would limit the Public </p><p>Procurement Agency\'s independence </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Separately, the Central Bank issued a statement (not </p><p>yet available in English) stressing the necessity of </p><p>implementing all aspects of the GOT\'s economic reform </p><p>program.  The statement notes that reduction of political </p><p>uncertainty in 2003 (compared with 2002) as a positive </p><p>factor.  It also notes negative factors: an Iraq operation </p><p>which could depreciate the lira and drive up oil prices; and </p><p>increases in domestic demand, stimulated by fiscal spending. </p><p>The statement concludes that, despite the negative factors, </p><p>"it is not impossible to attain the targeted 2003 inflation </p><p>rate, if the GOT establishes fiscal discipline and implements </p><p>structural reforms in line with the program."  Note: IMF </p><p>resrep (protect) told us January 10 that State Minister </p><p>Babacan had called Central Bank Governor Serdengecti to </p><p>complain about this statement, per Serdengecti.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment:  Although market developments have served </p><p>as a useful wake-up call, AK as a whole remains </p><p>less-than-fully-committed to sound economic policy. In the </p><p>weeks and months ahead, we, the IMF, and the markets will </p><p>need to maintain constant pressure. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
