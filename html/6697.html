<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001397 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, </p><p>CA/OCS/NEASA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/NEA, DSERCC, AND M </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/24/13 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, KHLS, PTER, PREL, EAID, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 5, MARCH 24 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1381 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/24. </p><p>Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy </p><p>compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/24 with </p><p>full staffing. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Consular Section resumed visa services today </p><p>and has received few calls from concerned AMCITs.  One of </p><p>the wardens from the Abu Dhabi-based Higher Colleges of </p><p>Technology contacted CONS and RSO yesterday to report that </p><p>the university had received a threatening email.  Per </p><p>instructions from RSO, the warden passed the information to </p><p>local police, who are investigating the threat. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) FCS noted that the American business community </p><p>remains calm, but reaction from local contacts ranges from </p><p>support for the military campaign in Iraq and determination </p><p>to oust Saddam Hussein, to anger and unwillingness to meet </p><p>with FCS Commercial Officers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) -- </p><p>representatives from the American business community who </p><p>liaise with RSO on security matters -- has met once a week </p><p>for the last month and will reconvene on 3/25.  OSAC </p><p>confirmed to RSO that very few American businesspeople and </p><p>their dependents have left the UAE since the onset of </p><p>hostilities in the region. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UAEG Actions/Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) DAO noted that yesterday NAVCENT received </p><p>outstanding cooperation from the UAE Navy, which located, </p><p>interdicted and searched the fishing vessel "BUSHRA II" and </p><p>released it to Coalition naval forces.  The UAE Navy was </p><p>also trying to locate the motor vessel "MARWAN", which may </p><p>be in UAE waters or in port.  Like the "BUSHRA II", the </p><p>"MARWAN" is suspected of being involved in mining </p><p>operations in the Gulf on behalf of the Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RSO confirmed that security inspection of American </p><p>and FSN employees at the Embassy would begin tomorrow 3/25. </p><p>Inspections will occur on a random, but reoccurring basis. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) ORCA and DAO mentioned a number of recent, </p><p>uncorroborated threat reports of an impending attack </p><p>against American interests in the Gulf, but noted there </p><p>were no specific threats related to the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Local Media </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) PAO reported that stories of Iraqi civilian </p><p>casualties and the U.S. POWs dominated the local papers </p><p>today.  Today\'s local press contained little coverage of </p><p>General Abizaid\'s news conference, probably owing to the </p><p>fact that the conference occurred at 2300 local time -- too </p><p>late to make the newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Unlike Abu Dhabi TV, which has presented balanced </p><p>news reporting -- for example, it has not shown the footage </p><p>of the U.S. POWs -- satellite-channel Sharjah TV\'s backdrop </p><p>showed repeated stills of the bombing of Baghdad.  Sharjah </p><p>TV also hosted yesterday UAE lawyer Dr. Mohammed Al-Rukn, </p><p>who quoted a British general from the 1917 occupation of </p><p>Baghdad and suggested that the U.S.-led Coalition intends </p><p>to occupy Iraq and steal its natural resources.  Abu Dhabi </p><p>TV and Al-Arabiyya channels showed footage of Iraqi </p><p>civilian casualties in hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at </p><p>1000 local time, 3/25. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included </p><p>AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, OBO, PAO, </p><p>ADMIN, USLO, FCS, FBI. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
