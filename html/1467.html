<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008647 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: FINANCE MINISTER PLANS REFORMS, BUT CAN HE DELIVER? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 24316 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On December 28 Finance Minister Amisi told </p><p>the Ambassador that he hopes to have Presidential approval </p><p>for both an interim economic reform program and a new budget </p><p>by mid-January.  He said his program would include market </p><p>liberalization, deficit reduction and policies to encourage </p><p>local food production.  He said the IFIs have agreed to </p><p>review GDRC performance after three months.  The Ambassador </p><p>gave Amisi information on requirements for USG debt </p><p>forgiveness, including military transparency.  Amisi appears </p><p>more committed than his predecessor to doing the right thing, </p><p>but his ability to put his plans into practice is </p><p>questionable.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Critical Time Ahead </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a visit from the Ambassador on December 28, </p><p>Minister of Finance Jean Amisi Kalondaya said he had two key </p><p>programs he would present to the President for approval by </p><p>mid-January.  One is a draft budget, which he expects to </p><p>complete within two weeks.  The other is an interim economic </p><p>reform program.  Amisi said that he expects a World Bank/IMF </p><p>team to visit Kinshasa around January 15, and implied that he </p><p>hopes to have government approval for the reform program </p><p>before they arrive.  (At their meeting on December 29 </p><p>(septel), recalling his talk with Amisi the previous day, </p><p>Ambassador Swing encouraged President Kabila to give full </p><p>support to the World Bank/IMF mission when it comes here in </p><p>January.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Pleased with International Support </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Amisi told the Ambassador he recently spoke by phone </p><p>with World Bank President Wolfensohn and IMF Managing </p><p>Director Kohler, and he said that both expressed support. </p><p>Amisi said the IFIs had agreed to review the DRC\'s </p><p>performance three months after his reform program is </p><p>implemented and to consider a negotiated program at that </p><p>time.  He acknowledged that past recommendations from Bank </p><p>and Fund experts had not been followed, but noted that </p><p>despite this the World Bank is moving ahead to activate the </p><p>Emergency Stabilization Fund.  Amisi told the Ambassador that </p><p>he hoped to use most of the $5 million in the Stabilization </p><p>Fund for road-building projects.  He also expressed </p><p>satisfaction with the African Development Bank\'s plan to </p><p>begin a major capacity building project for the GDRC. </p><p>Finally, he said the European Community will release 200 </p><p>million euro in credits for the DRC as soon as the GDRC pays </p><p>a $500 thousand membership fee, something he hopes to achieve </p><p>in the next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The Reform Program </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Amisi gave only a broad overview of his reform </p><p>program.  He said he plans to liberalize diamond, petroleum </p><p>and foreign exchange markets, but noted that foreign exchange </p><p>liberalization will need to be staged.  He admitted that </p><p>current policy includes a large subsidy for fuels that the </p><p>government can ill afford.  He told the Ambassador he is </p><p>confident that he can increase government revenues </p><p>dramatically and thereby reduce the budget deficit, which </p><p>will allow the GDRC to reduce money supply growth and control </p><p>inflation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Amisi was enthusiastic about plans to reduce the </p><p>demand for hard currency by increasing local production and </p><p>limiting imports.  He told the Ambassador that restrictions </p><p>on the DRC\'s imports of salted fish will quickly lead to a </p><p>resurgent fishing industry.  Similarly, he said, local </p><p>production of pork, chicken, corn and manioc must be </p><p>encouraged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>The Importance of Getting It Right </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador told Amisi that he was wise to make </p><p>relations with the IFIs one of his top priorities, since </p><p>their participation will help the DRC design the right </p><p>program, will open the way to multilateral financing, and is </p><p>a prerequisite for bilateral debt relief.  He gave the </p><p>Minister information on the HIPC program and noted that the </p><p>USG is committed to providing debt relief to countries </p><p>meeting requirements.  He also described for Amisi U.S. </p><p>legislation relating to military budget transparency and left </p><p>him a copy of the demarche delivered to former-Minister </p><p>Mawampanga in March (Reftel).  The Ambassador recommended </p><p>that the GDRC focus efforts on reform of the parastatal </p><p>sector as well.  He explained USG restrictions on assistance </p><p>to the GDRC to Amisi, but noted that we still had the </p><p>opportunity to be helpful in promoting reform, such as when </p><p>we sponsored the Public-Private Partnership Forum in October. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It was a refreshing change to discuss economic issues </p><p>with the Finance Minister, instead of listening to an </p><p>emotional diatribe about the war.  Amisi said all the right </p><p>things about market liberalization, and about fiscal and </p><p>monetary restraint.  However, his belief that food imports </p><p>can quickly be replaced appears naive, and his estimate of </p><p>the amount and speed of international support the GDRC can </p><p>expect appears overly optimistic.  More importantly, his </p><p>success will hinge on his ability to secure the support of </p><p>President Kabila in the face of opposition from some of those </p><p>closest to the President.  Nothing we know about him or saw </p><p>during our call inspires confidence that he will be able to </p><p>deliver where others have failed. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
