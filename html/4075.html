<p>UNCLAS E F T O SECTION 01 OF 28 COLOMBO 001993 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL/PHD, DRL/CDA FOR ACTION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, ELAB, PREL, KSEP, CE, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Draft submission for 2002 Annual </p><p>Human Rights Report </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 151191 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, </p><p>PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU/NF) THE DRAFT TEXT FOR THE SRI LANKA ANNUAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT FOR 2002 FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka is a democratic republic with an active </p><p>multiparty system. Constitutional power is shared between </p><p>the popularly elected president and the 225-member </p><p>Parliament. Violence, including at least 50 deaths, and </p><p>irregularities marred the December 2001 Parliamentary </p><p>elections in which the United National Front (UNF), a </p><p>coalition of parties led by the United National Party </p><p>(UNP), won a majority in Parliament for a 6-year term. </p><p>Chandrika Kumaratunga, head of the People\'s Alliance (PA) </p><p>coalition, won reelection in 1999 for a second 5-year </p><p>presidential term in a process marked by voting </p><p>irregularities and at least six election-related deaths. </p><p>The Government generally respects constitutional </p><p>provisions for an independent judiciary. </p><p>Due to the peace process, Sri Lanka has experienced a </p><p>dramatically improved atmosphere in 2002. One of the most </p><p>visible signs of the new national climate was the </p><p>profound and positive effect the peace process has had on </p><p>the human rights situation. Beginning in December 2001, </p><p>when the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) announced unilateral ceasefires, the peace </p><p>process has picked up considerable momentum. Key events </p><p>included:  in February 2002, the two sides signed a </p><p>formal ceasefire accord; in April, a key road connecting </p><p>Jaffna with the south was reopened; in September, taking </p><p>into account the fast progress of the peace process, the </p><p>government legalized the LTTE; and, also in September, </p><p>the two sides held their first round of peace talks in </p><p>Thailand.  Among many other positive human rights-related </p><p>developments, the peace process also led to a sharp </p><p>reduction in roadblocks and checkpoints around the </p><p>country, the return of approximately 150,000 Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDPs) to their points of origin in the </p><p>north and east, and to the opening of numerous </p><p>investigations into questionable actions by security </p><p>force personnel. </p><p> </p><p>During 2002, the Government also released over 750 Tamils </p><p>held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Several </p><p>of those released were part of the first Government-LTTE </p><p>prisoner exchange in September.  No arrests have been </p><p>made under the PTA in 2002. Observers claim that the PTA, </p><p>like the Emergency Regulations (ER) repealed in 2001, </p><p>permitted arbitrary arrests of Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>The past year was one of transition for the security </p><p>forces from an organization actively engaged in an armed </p><p>conflict to one taking part in a peace process.  Although </p><p>some incidents of human rights violations occurred during </p><p>the year, the security forces generally respected the </p><p>rights of others.  Prior to the December 2001 unilateral </p><p>ceasefires, the Government had fought the LTTE, a </p><p>terrorist organization fighting for a separate ethnic </p><p>Tamil state in the north and east of the country, for 18 </p><p>years. The conflict claimed more than 64,000 lives. Major </p><p>milestones in the conflict in the recent past included: </p><p>In 2000, the LTTE began a buildup on the Jaffna Peninsula </p><p>and captured the important Elephant Pass military base; </p><p>in April 2001, government troops launched a major </p><p>offensive on the Jaffna Peninsula that resulted in heavy </p><p>casualties for its forces; and in July 2001, the LTTE </p><p>attacked Colombo\'s main airbase and international </p><p>airport, destroying numerous aircraft and placing </p><p>civilians at the airport at serious risk. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Interior controls the 60,000-member </p><p>police force, which is responsible for internal security </p><p>in most areas of the country, and has been used in </p><p>military operations against the LTTE. The Ministry of </p><p>Defense controls the 120,000-member Army (which includes </p><p>the Army Volunteer Force), the 17,000-member Navy, and </p><p>the 18,500 member Air Force.  The more than 20,000 member </p><p>Home Guards, an armed force drawn from local communities </p><p>and responsible to the police, provide security for </p><p>Muslim and Sinhalese village communities near LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas.  During the year, the Government </p><p>implemented programs to disarm various anti-LTTE militias </p><p>that previously had been linked with the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka is a low-income country with a market economy </p><p>based mainly on the export of textiles, tea, rubber, </p><p>coconuts, and gems. It also earns substantial foreign </p><p>exchange from the repatriated earnings of citizens </p><p>employed abroad, and from tourism. The gross domestic </p><p>product (GDP) per capita is approximately $837 (80,350 </p><p>rupees). The population is approximately 18.5 million. </p><p>Real GDP growth was -1.4 percent in 2001. Growth during </p><p>the year is forecast at 2-3 percent. The decline in 2001 </p><p>was attributed mainly to the worldwide economic downturn, </p><p>the July LTTE attack on Colombo\'s international airport, </p><p>and prolonged power outages throughout the country.  The </p><p>economy is expected to recover slowly in 2002, aided by </p><p>economic reform and increased donor assistance. </p><p> </p><p>The Government generally respected the human rights of </p><p>its citizens in 2002, but there remained problems in some </p><p>areas.  Unlike previous years, there were no credible </p><p>reports of security forces committing extrajudicial </p><p>killings. The military and police, however, reportedly </p><p>tortured detainees.  There was at least one report of a </p><p>death in custody and of a separate case of rape of a </p><p>woman while she was in custody. </p><p> </p><p>Torture remained a problem and prison conditions remained </p><p>poor. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests. </p><p>The Government infringed on citizens\' privacy rights, but </p><p>restrictions on the freedom of the press were eased </p><p>somewhat. In 2001, the Government stopped censoring </p><p>reporting on military and security operations. In </p><p>previous years, the Government had stringent censorship </p><p>regulations and on occasion security forces harassed </p><p>journalists and shut down newspapers critical of the </p><p>government. There were no reports of such harassment </p><p>during the year. The LTTE permitted controlled access to </p><p>uncleared areas of the country to journalists, in effect </p><p>lifting some censorship in the areas it controls. Some </p><p>LTTE-imposed restrictions remained on freedom of </p><p>movement, such as from Vavuniya to Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>Violence and discrimination against women, child </p><p>prostitution, child labor, and discrimination against </p><p>persons with disabilities continued to be problems in Sri </p><p>Lanka. Trafficking in women and children for the purpose </p><p>of forced labor occurs, and there is some trafficking of </p><p>women and children for the commercial sex industry. There </p><p>is evidence of a continued though declining international </p><p>interest in the country\'s children for sex trade. There </p><p>is some discrimination and occasional violence against </p><p>religious minorities, and institutionalized ethnic </p><p>discrimination against Tamils remains a problem. </p><p> </p><p>In the past few years, the Government has taken steps to </p><p>address human rights concerns. In 2002 the Government </p><p>named a new chairman for the National Human Rights </p><p>Commission (HRC). In 2000, the Government established an </p><p>Interministerial Permanent Standing Committee and an </p><p>Interministerial Working Group on Human Rights Issues, </p><p>chaired by senior officials, to investigate human rights </p><p>abuses. At the same time, the Government established the </p><p>Prosecution of Torture Perpetrators Unit, under the </p><p>direct supervision of the Attorney General. Former Tamil </p><p>terrorist organizations aligned with the former PA </p><p>Government, who are suspected to still be armed have, in </p><p>a departure from previous years, not been implicated in </p><p>cases involving extrajudicial killing, and torture </p><p>although incidents of detention, and extortion were still </p><p>reported during the year. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE continued to commit serious human rights abuses </p><p>even after entering into a formal ceasefire accord with </p><p>the Government. The LTTE reportedly committed several </p><p>extrajudicial killings, and was responsible for </p><p>disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest, detentions, </p><p>and extortion. Through a campaign of intimidation, the </p><p>LTTE continued to undermine the work of elected local </p><p>government bodies in Jaffna. On occasion, the LTTE </p><p>prevented political and governmental activities from </p><p>occurring in the north and east. The LTTE released all of </p><p>the military personnel it reportedly had in its custody </p><p>during the year. The LTTE continued to control large </p><p>sections of the north and east of the country. The LTTE </p><p>denied those under its control the right to change their </p><p>government, infringed on privacy rights, did not provide </p><p>for fair trials, used child soldiers, and discriminated </p><p>against ethnic and religious minorities. </p><p>RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, </p><p>Including Freedom From: </p><p> </p><p>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life </p><p> </p><p>Unlike in previous years, there were no credible reports </p><p>of security forces committing extrajudicial killings. On </p><p>July 19, 2001, government security forces killed two </p><p>persons during an opposition party sponsored rally which </p><p>the Government claimed was illegal (see Section 2.b.). On </p><p>January 28, 2001, naval personnel arrested </p><p>Kanapathypillai Udayakumar, a Tamil villager. The </p><p>following day his body was returned to his family. The </p><p>report on his killing states that he was strangled to </p><p>death. The naval personnel accused in connection with his </p><p>killing are in custody awaiting trial. On September 20, </p><p>2001, Sivagnanam Manohari, a Tamil living near </p><p>Batticaloa, apparently was shot and killed by air force </p><p>personnel while fishing. Her nephew, who was with her at </p><p>the time, was injured seriously. No arrests have been </p><p>made to date, but the incident is still under </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>The appearance of impunity remains a problem. Between </p><p>April 1995 and December 2001, several hundred persons </p><p>were killed extrajudicially by the security forces or </p><p>have disappeared after being taken into security force </p><p>custody. With the exception of the six security force </p><p>personnel convicted in the 1996 killing of Krishanthi </p><p>Kumaraswamy (a Tamil university student who was raped and </p><p>then killed) there have been no other convictions for </p><p>extrajudicial killings.   Although there were numerous </p><p>cases in which military personnel may have committed </p><p>human rights violations for which they have not been </p><p>identified, the Government has passed indictments against </p><p>security force personnel in a number of high profile </p><p>cases; including the Bindunuwewa massacre and the Ranjani </p><p>rape and murder case (see below). </p><p> </p><p>In December 2000, nine Tamil civilians were reported </p><p>missing in Mirusuvil after being arrested by the army </p><p>(SLA). One person escaped, and reported the incident to </p><p>police and the local magistrate. The escapee identified </p><p>two SLA soldiers as the perpetrators, and the soldiers </p><p>admitted to torturing nine civilians and murdering eight </p><p>of them. The soldiers identified the place of burial and </p><p>the bodies were exhumed. Nine soldiers later were </p><p>arrested for the torture and killings. The army commander </p><p>administratively punished the soldiers by having their </p><p>salaries withheld (see Sections 1.b. and 1.c.). The case </p><p>was transferred to the Anuradhapura Magistrate\'s Court </p><p>for adjudication in November 2001.  At the end of </p><p>September 2002, a trial-at-bar was continuing with </p><p>expectations that indictments would be issued prior to </p><p>year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>In November 2000, four mutilated bodies were found in </p><p>Nilaveli. The killings were widely believed to have been </p><p>carried out by naval infantry personnel. The following </p><p>day Tamil civilians protested against the deaths claiming </p><p>that the naval personnel involved attempted to coerce </p><p>statements from relatives of the deceased that the dead </p><p>were members of the LTTE. Later, the bodies of the two </p><p>primary organizers of the demonstration were found. The </p><p>military investigated the incident. The commander of the </p><p>local navy base and other key military personnel were </p><p>transferred in June, but no one has been charged in </p><p>connection with the killings.  No further action is </p><p>anticipated in this case. </p><p> </p><p>In October 2000, while police allegedly looked on, 27 </p><p>young Tamil males held at the Bindunuwewa rehabilitation </p><p>camp for former child soldiers, were killed by local </p><p>villagers; 15 others were injured. Police allegedly took </p><p>part in the killings and did nothing to prevent the </p><p>villagers from entering the detention camp. Violence </p><p>after the killings continued for almost one week before </p><p>police were able to restore order. The HRC stated that </p><p>the police were guilty of "grave dereliction of duty." </p><p>Three of the survivors were able to testify at a </p><p>Presidential Hearing, which met regularly throughout </p><p>2001. Many witnesses at the hearing criticized police </p><p>actions at the scene and during the initial </p><p>investigations. In 2001, all suspects in the case were </p><p>released on bail.  At year\'s end, 10 police officers and </p><p>41 villagers were indicted and were standing trial. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2000, gunmen in police uniforms killed the chief </p><p>suspect in the 1993 killing of prominent politician </p><p>Lalith Athulathmudali. There have been no arrests in </p><p>connection with this killing and at year\'s end none were </p><p>expected. </p><p> </p><p>In 2000, the government ordered payment of compensation </p><p>to victims of a 1999 air force bombing that killed 22 </p><p>civilians at Puthukkudiyiruppu. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, some cases of extrajudicial killings were </p><p>reprisals against civilians for LTTE attacks in which </p><p>members of the security forces or civilians were killed </p><p>or injured. In most cases, the security forces claimed </p><p>that the victims were members of the LTTE, but human </p><p>rights monitors believed otherwise. In Thampalakamam, </p><p>near Trincomalee, in February 1998, police and home </p><p>guards allegedly killed eight Tamil civilians, possibly </p><p>in reprisal for the LTTE bombing of the Temple of the </p><p>Tooth a week earlier. The Government arrested police </p><p>officers and home guards, charging 4 with murder and 17 </p><p>with unlawful assembly. At year\'s end 8 police officers </p><p>had been indicted and hearings were ongoing. </p><p>Crucial safeguards built into the Emergency Regulations </p><p>(ER) and the legislation establishing the HRC often were </p><p>ignored in the past by the security forces, especially </p><p>those provisions requiring receipts to be issued for </p><p>arrests and ordering the security forces to notify the </p><p>HRC of any arrest within 48 hours. Although security </p><p>force personnel could have been fined or jailed for </p><p>failure to comply with the ER, none was known to have </p><p>been punished for this while the ER provisions were in </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p>Although the courts in 2000 ordered five soldiers </p><p>arrested for the 1999 gang rape and murder of Ida </p><p>Carmelita, a young Tamil girl, the case remained pending </p><p>at year\'s end. Various witnesses continued to testify at </p><p>hearings held during the year. Court hearings continued </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>At his sentencing for the 1998 rape and murder of </p><p>Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, a Tamil university student, </p><p>former Lance Corporal Somaratne Rajapakse claimed </p><p>knowledge of mass graves at Chemmani in Jaffna containing </p><p>the bodies of up to 400 persons killed by security forces </p><p>in 1996. The other five defendants corroborated his claim </p><p>of mass graves in the Chemmani area, where they allegedly </p><p>had buried between 120 and 140 bodies on the orders of </p><p>their superiors. Exhumations in 1999 yielded 15 </p><p>skeletons. Two of the victims were identified as young </p><p>men who had disappeared in 1996. In late 1999, the </p><p>Government submitted its forensic report to a magistrate </p><p>in Jaffna; the report stated that 10 of the remains </p><p>showed signs of physical assault that led to their deaths </p><p>and that physical assault leading to death of the others </p><p>could not be ruled out. At the end of 2001, 13 of the </p><p>bodies had not been identified. Rajapakse and others </p><p>named a total of 20 security force personnel, including </p><p>former policemen, as responsible for the killings. The </p><p>remaining unidentified bodies underwent DNA testing for </p><p>identification purposes. The Attorney General\'s office </p><p>has indicated that it was not satisfied with the </p><p>inconclusive initial results and is currently searching </p><p>for funds to provide for a more detailed test. At year\'s </p><p>end, the case was still pending. All suspects in the case </p><p>have been released on bail. </p><p>The case against eight soldiers and one reserve police </p><p>constable arrested in February 1996 in the massacre of 24 </p><p>Tamil villagers in Kumarapuram came to trial in September </p><p>1997. In November 1998, six of the soldiers were charged </p><p>with murder. The case continued throughout the year with </p><p>the next court hearing scheduled for February 18, 2003. </p><p>The case of 22 STF members arrested on suspicion of </p><p>killing 23 Tamil youths at Bolgoda Lake in 1995 went to </p><p>trial in June 2000. Three police officers have been </p><p>indicted in connection with the murders, one of whom has </p><p>fled.  As of September 30, 2002, the main witness in the </p><p>case was residing outside of Sri Lanka.  The hearing </p><p>continued at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>The PA Government came to power in 1994 and promised to </p><p>bring to justice the perpetrators of extrajudicial </p><p>killings from previous years. In 1994, it began </p><p>prosecutions in several extrajudicial killings allegedly </p><p>committed by members of the security forces. The trial of </p><p>21 soldiers accused of massacring 35 Tamil civilians in </p><p>1992 in the village of Mailanthani in Batticaloa district </p><p>was transferred to the Colombo High Court in 1996. A jury </p><p>trial began in January 2002, and was still hearing </p><p>testimony as of September 30, 2002. Many witnesses for </p><p>the case live in displaced persons camps, and they could </p><p>not come to court to give evidence. </p><p> </p><p>In January 2000, assailants shot and killed Tamil </p><p>politician Kumar Ponnambalam. Police detained four </p><p>persons, two of whom alleged that a local businessman had </p><p>hired them to commit the murder. The investigation into </p><p>the murder has been completed and the information has </p><p>been passed to the Attorney General.  At the end of </p><p>September, a court date was being considered for the </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>Although former terrorist Tamil militant groups armed by </p><p>and aligned with the former PA Government committed </p><p>extrajudicial killings in the past, there were no </p><p>credible reports of such killings in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, the military wing of the People\'s Liberation </p><p>Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and the Razeek group </p><p>were responsible for killing a number of persons. The </p><p>security forces had armed and used these militias and a </p><p>number of other Tamil militant organizations to provide </p><p>information, to help identify LTTE terrorists, and, in </p><p>some cases, to fight in military operations against the </p><p>terrorists. The exact size of these militias is </p><p>impossible to ascertain, but they probably total fewer </p><p>than 2,000 persons. These groups were asked to disarm </p><p>following the formal February ceasefire agreement between </p><p>the Government and LTTE.  The militia did hand over some </p><p>weapons to the Government.  Most observers, however, </p><p>believe that the groups kept some arms. Persons killed by </p><p>these militants in the past probably included LTTE </p><p>operatives and civilians who failed to comply with </p><p>extortion demands. Unknown assailants killed Jaffna media </p><p>correspondent Mayilvaganam Nimalarajan in October 2000. </p><p>Nimalarajan\'s outspoken criticism of paramilitary groups </p><p>in Jaffna led many to believe that one of these groups </p><p>killed him. No one has been prosecuted for his death. </p><p>There have been unconfirmed reports that the LTTE </p><p>continued to commit extrajudicial killings. Due to the </p><p>inaccessibility of LTTE-controlled areas and the LTTE\'s </p><p>prevention of investigations by outside agencies, the </p><p>exact number and type of killings in LTTE-controlled </p><p>areas is unknown. Observers believe that the amount of </p><p>killings was drastically reduced last year.  Attacks by </p><p>the LTTE killed civilians outside of LTTE-controlled </p><p>areas in the past.  A civilian bus on the way to </p><p>Trincomalee was bombed by the LTTE in August 2001, for </p><p>example, and a trishaw was bombed outside of Jaffna in </p><p>September 2001 (see Section 1.g.). </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, attacks and counter-attacks between Government </p><p>forces and the LTTE occurred almost daily. There were two </p><p>suicide bombing attacks attributed to the LTTE during </p><p>2001, on September 15 and October 29, in addition to the </p><p>July attack on the airport north of Colombo (see Section </p><p>1.g.). There were no reports of suicide bombings in 2002. </p><p>There were reports that the LTTE committed extrajudicial </p><p>killings, including lamppost killings in 2001. At least </p><p>14 persons found guilty of offenses by the LTTE\'s self- </p><p>described courts were killed in 1999 by the LTTE in </p><p>public executions; their bodies were tied to lampposts or </p><p>otherwise left for public display. The LTTE has bombed </p><p>civilian targets, killing and injuring civilians, and </p><p>engaged in hostage taking and hijackings. (see Section </p><p>1.g.) </p><p>In March 1999, municipal workers uncovered a pit in </p><p>Jaffna town that contained the skeletal remains of </p><p>several persons. Forensic evidence suggested that these </p><p>remains were approximately 10 years old. This discovery </p><p>potentially implicated the Indian Peacekeeping Force </p><p>(IPKF), which occupied Jaffna at the time.  b. </p><p>Disappearance </p><p> </p><p>Unlike previous years, there were no credible reports of </p><p>disappearances at the hands of the security forces in Sri </p><p>Lanka during 2002. </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, the army, navy, police, and paramilitary groups </p><p>were involved in as many as 10 disappearances, primarily </p><p>in Vavuniya. Between January and September 2001, the </p><p>Human Rights Commission received 44 reports of </p><p>disappearances in Vavuniya alone. These cases were not </p><p>confirmed. In December 2000, eight Tamil civilians were </p><p>reported missing in Mirusuvil. Two SLA soldiers were </p><p>identified as perpetrators and admitted to killing eight </p><p>of the civilians.  The soldiers were administratively </p><p>punished by the army (see Sections 1.a. and 1.c.). In </p><p>November 2001, the case was transferred to the </p><p>Anuradhapura Magistrate\'s Court for adjudication. The </p><p>soldiers have been indicted and a trial-at-bar was </p><p>scheduled to begin by early 2003. </p><p> </p><p>In February 2000, a fisherman seen arrested by naval </p><p>personnel near Trincomalee disappeared. In 2002, the </p><p>Trincomalee High Court ordered police line up, but the </p><p>witness did not identify any of the suspects.  At year\'s </p><p>end, the High Court was conducting a habeas corpus </p><p>hearing in conjunction with the case. Those who </p><p>disappeared in 2001 and previous years are usually </p><p>presumed dead. The 2000 U.N. Working Group on Enforced or </p><p>Involuntary Disappearances lists the country as having an </p><p>extremely large number of "nonclarified" disappearances. </p><p>The Commander of the Army and the Inspector General of </p><p>Police both have criticized the disappearances and stated </p><p>that the perpetrators would be called to account. </p><p>Although there have been few prosecutions of security </p><p>force personnel to date, 2002 saw numerous indictments </p><p>and investigations opened into cases which had previously </p><p>been ignored. </p><p>Three regional commissions were set up in November 1994 </p><p>to inquire into disappearances that occurred from 1988 to </p><p>1994. The commissions found that 16,742 persons </p><p>disappeared after having been removed involuntarily from </p><p>their homes in most cases by security forces. Based on </p><p>the reports, police created a Disappearances </p><p>Investigations Unit (DIU) in 1998 to examine 1,681 cases </p><p>in which the commissions had evidence against specific </p><p>individuals. </p><p> </p><p>In 1999, the Attorney General created a Missing Persons </p><p>Commissions Unit to consider institution of criminal </p><p>proceedings based on results of DIU investigations. In </p><p>2000, the Attorney General\'s office opened over 1,175 </p><p>files and referred 262 indictments to the high courts and </p><p>86 complaints to magistrates involving 583 members of the </p><p>security forces on abduction and murder charges. Hearings </p><p>and trials in at least 250 of these cases had begun by </p><p>late 2000. Of these, the Attorney General\'s office </p><p>successfully prosecuted 4 cases by year\'s end. The </p><p>Attorney General\'s office continued to prosecute these </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>In 1998, a fourth commission was established to look into </p><p>approximately 10,000 cases of disappearance that the </p><p>initial three commissions had been unable to investigate. </p><p>Human rights observers have criticized the Government for </p><p>not extending the mandate of this commission to include </p><p>cases of disappearance that occurred since the </p><p>Kumaratunga Government took office in 1994. The </p><p>commission submitted an interim report to President </p><p>Kumaratunga in December 1999 and a final report in August </p><p>2000. The report has not been made public. </p><p>In 1999, the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or </p><p>Involuntary Disappearances made its third visit to the </p><p>country. Its report, released in December 1999 cited the </p><p>Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and ER as important </p><p>factors contributing to disappearances and recommended </p><p>the abolition or modification of these laws to bring them </p><p>into conformity with internationally accepted human </p><p>rights standards. The ER was repealed in 2001 and there </p><p>were no arrests under the PTA last year.  Criminal </p><p>arrests were still being made without proper procedures, </p><p>however. </p><p>In past years, Tamil militias aligned with the former PA </p><p>government were responsible for disappearances in past </p><p>years, although there were no reports during the last 2 </p><p>years. These militias detained persons at various </p><p>locations that served, in effect, as undeclared detention </p><p>centers. The HRC had no mandate or authority to enforce </p><p>respect for human rights among these militia groups. It </p><p>was impossible to determine the exact number of victims </p><p>because of the secrecy with which these groups operated. </p><p>In early 2002, the Government took steps to disarm these </p><p>militias while guaranteeing their safety as part of the </p><p>peace process. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE was responsible for an undetermined number of </p><p>civilian disappearances in the north and east during the </p><p>year. Although the LTTE has previously denied taking any </p><p>prisoners from its battles in January they released 10 </p><p>Sri Lankans, including some soldiers, to the ICRC.  On </p><p>September 28 they exchanged a further 7 Sri Lankan </p><p>soldiers for 13 of their cadre.  At year\'s end, the LTTE </p><p>was not known to be holding any prisoners. (See section </p><p>1.g.) </p><p> </p><p>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading </p><p>Treatment or Punishment </p><p> </p><p>Despite legal prohibitions, the security forces and </p><p>police continue to torture and mistreat persons in police </p><p>custody and prisons.The Convention Against Torture Act </p><p>(CATA) made torture a punishable offense. Under the CATA, </p><p>torture is defined as a specific crime, the High Court </p><p>has jurisdiction over violations, and criminal conviction </p><p>carries a 7-year minimum sentence. According to a 1999 </p><p>Amnesty International (AI) report, however, the CATA does </p><p>not implement several provisions of the U.N. Convention; </p><p>this results in torture being prohibited under specific </p><p>circumstances but allowed under others. Consequently, </p><p>torture continues. In addition, the PTA makes confessions </p><p>obtained under any circumstance, including by torture, </p><p>sufficient to hold a person until they are brought to </p><p>court.  In some cases, the detention can extend for </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>Since 2000, the Government has been working on developing </p><p>regulations to prosecute and punish military and police </p><p>personnel responsible for torture. The Attorney General\'s </p><p>Office and the Criminal Investigation Unit have </p><p>established units to focus on torture complaints; the </p><p>units have forwarded 14 cases for indictments during the </p><p>year. The Interparliamentary Permanent Standing Committee </p><p>and its Interministerial Working Group on Human Rights </p><p>Issues have begun tracking criminal investigations of </p><p>torture. In addition, the Government also ceased paying </p><p>fines incurred by security force personnel found guilty </p><p>of torture. Security force personnel have been fined </p><p>under civil statutes for engaging in torture. According </p><p>to the Attorney General\'s Office, members of the security </p><p>forces and police have been prosecuted under criminal </p><p>statutes, but none of the cases had come to conclusion. </p><p>The appearance of impunity remains a problem. In the </p><p>majority of cases in which military personnel may have </p><p>committed human rights abuses, the Government has not </p><p>identified those responsible and brought them to justice. </p><p> </p><p>Members of the security forces continued to torture and </p><p>mistreat detainees and other prisoners, particularly </p><p>during interrogation. Detainees have reported broken </p><p>bones and other serious injuries as a result of their </p><p>mistreatment. There was a report of rape in detention </p><p>during the year. Medical examination of persons arrested </p><p>from 2000 to this year continued to reveal multiple cases </p><p>of torture. In December 2000, the bodies of eight Tamils </p><p>tortured and killed by the army in Mirusuvil were exhumed </p><p>after one person escaped and notified authorities. Nine </p><p>soldiers were arrested, and by year\'s end, a trial-at-bar </p><p>had begun (see Sections 1.a. and 1.b.). The military also </p><p>conducted its own inquiry; the personnel involved have </p><p>been discharged. </p><p> </p><p>Thivyan Krishnasamy, a student leader and an outspoken </p><p>critic of the actions of security forces in Jaffna, was </p><p>released from custody on March 15.  He claimed that he </p><p>was tortured while in custody. Human rights observers </p><p>claim that he was arrested because of his political </p><p>activism, but the police stated that he was connected to </p><p>the LTTE. He was arrested on July 2 and when he was </p><p>brought before a court in August he complained of being </p><p>tortured. In response to his allegations of torture, the </p><p>Jaffna Student Union held protests during the fall of </p><p>2001. In response, university administrators temporarily </p><p>closed the university to avoid violence. </p><p> </p><p>During 2001, there were a number of reports of women </p><p>being raped by security forces while in detention. One </p><p>such case involved two women arrested on March 19 in </p><p>Mannar. The women claim that they were tortured and </p><p>repeatedly raped by naval and police personnel. The women </p><p>were released on bail in April 2001 and have filed </p><p>charges against their assailants. At year\'s end, the 14 </p><p>accused were standing trial for rape, torture or both. A </p><p>fundamental rights case was also opened against the </p><p>accused. Four other cases in which the security forces </p><p>are accused of raping women in detention were still </p><p>pending at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>Under fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution, </p><p>torture victims may file civil suit for compensation in </p><p>the high courts or Supreme Court. Courts have granted </p><p>awards ranging from approximately $175 (14,200 rupees) to </p><p>$2,280 (182,500 rupees). In February 2001, the Colombo </p><p>high court ordered compensation of $625 (50,000 rupees) </p><p>to a young man beaten in police custody in Vavuniya and </p><p>Colombo in 1999. In August 2001, the Supreme Court </p><p>ordered $1,250 (100,000 rupees) in compensation for a </p><p>Tamil man tortured in December 1999 at an army camp near </p><p>Batticaloa. Most cases take 2 years or more to move </p><p>through the courts, however. </p><p> </p><p>The appearance of impunity remains a problem. In the </p><p>majority of cases in which military personnel may have </p><p>committed human rights abuses, the Government has not </p><p>identified those responsible and brought them to justice. </p><p> </p><p>At the invitation of the Government, the United Nations </p><p>Committee on Torture sent a five-person mission to </p><p>Colombo in August 2000 to determine whether a systematic </p><p>pattern of torture exists in the country and, if so, to </p><p>make recommendations for eliminating the practice. By the </p><p>end of 2001, the mission had submitted its confidential </p><p>report to President Kumaratunga.  The report has not been </p><p>released to the public. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, Tamil militants aligned with the former PA </p><p>government engaged in torture. With the apparent </p><p>knowledge of the security forces, the PLOTE in Vavuniya </p><p>and the EPDP in Jaffna, were criticized for torturing </p><p>their opponents. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE reportedly used torture on a routine basis. </p><p>Prison conditions generally are poor and do not meet </p><p>international standards because of overcrowding and lack </p><p>of sanitary facilities. The Government permitted </p><p>representatives from the International Committee of the </p><p>Red Cross (ICRC) to visit approximately 160 places of </p><p>detention. The HRC also visited over 2,000 police </p><p>stations and over 500 detention facilities by year\'s end </p><p>(see Section 1.d.). </p><p> </p><p>Conditions also are reportedly poor in LTTE-run detention </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE permitted the ICRC to visit Sri Lankan soldiers </p><p>detained in the Vavuniya region approximately once every </p><p>6 weeks until their release (see Section 1.g.).  Due to </p><p>the release of detainees in 2000 and the apparent release </p><p>of the remaining Sri Lankan soldiers held by the LTTE, </p><p>ICRC visited fewer LTTE detention centers than in </p><p>previous years (see Section 1.d.).  d. Arbitrary Arrest, </p><p>Detention, or Exile </p><p> </p><p>Arbitrary arrest and detention are problems. Under the </p><p>law, authorities must inform an arrested person of the </p><p>reason for arrest and bring that person before a </p><p>magistrate within 24 hours. In practice, persons detained </p><p>generally appear before a magistrate within a few days of </p><p>arrest. The magistrate may authorize bail or order </p><p>continued pretrial detention for up to three months or </p><p>longer.  Security forces must issue an arrest receipt at </p><p>the time of arrest, despite some efforts by the </p><p>Government to enforce this standard, arrest receipts are </p><p>rarely issued.  The lack of providing arrest receipts, </p><p>observers believe, prevents adequate tracking of cases. </p><p>The lack of tracking also permits extended detentions and </p><p>torture without making anyone directly responsible for </p><p>those being held. </p><p> </p><p>Under the ER (which lapsed in July 2001) and the PTA </p><p>(under which there were no arrests in 2002), security </p><p>forces could detain suspects for extended periods of time </p><p>without court approval. The ER, in force periodically </p><p>since 1979 and in force island-wide from August 1998 </p><p>until July 2001, gave security forces broad powers to </p><p>arrest and detain without charge or the right to judicial </p><p>review. ER provisions permitted police to hold </p><p>individuals for up to 90 days to investigate suspected </p><p>offenses, although the police had to present detainees to </p><p>a court within 30 days to record the detention. The court </p><p>was able to order a further 6 months\' detention. </p><p> </p><p>In past years, the army generally turned over those that </p><p>it arrested under the ER to the police within 24 hours, </p><p>although the police and the army did not always issue </p><p>arrest receipts or notify the HRC within 48 hours. The </p><p>HRC has a legal mandate to visit those arrested, and </p><p>police generally respected this. Due to censorship and </p><p>infrequent access, observers could not determine the </p><p>state of affairs in LTTE-controlled areas. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, there were credible reports that the </p><p>military held persons for short amounts of time in </p><p>smaller camps for interrogation before transferring them </p><p>to declared places of detention. This procedure, which </p><p>allegedly occurred on the Jaffna peninsula, in Vavuniya, </p><p>and in the east (see Section 1.c.), did not comply with </p><p>requirements to notify the HRC of arrests and to issue </p><p>arrest receipts. The military maintained the detainees </p><p>were "in transit," and claimed they did not violate the </p><p>detainees\' rights. </p><p> </p><p>Unlike previous years, there were no large-scale arrests </p><p>of Tamils during the year. In the past, many detentions </p><p>occurred during operations against the LTTE. Most </p><p>detentions lasted a maximum of several days although some </p><p>extended to several months. The number of prisoners held </p><p>at any given moment under the ER and the PTA fluctuated </p><p>between 1,500 and 2,000. As of September 1, 222 Tamils </p><p>charged under the PTA remained in detention without bail </p><p>awaiting trial.  As part of the peace process\' confidence </p><p>building measures, the Government released over 750 </p><p>Tamils arrested under the PTA during the first 8 months </p><p>of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Unlike previous years, there were no cordon and search </p><p>operations during 2002.  In previous years, Tamils </p><p>complained that they were abused verbally and held for </p><p>extended periods at security checkpoints throughout </p><p>Colombo. During the week following the July 24, 2001, </p><p>attack on Colombo\'s main airbase and international </p><p>airport, security forces detained hundreds of Tamils in </p><p>the Colombo region for questioning. In addition, those </p><p>arrested sometimes were held in prisons with convicted </p><p>criminals. The vast majority of checkpoints were removed </p><p>in January and the reports largely ceased (see Section </p><p>1.d.). </p><p> </p><p>In July 1998, the President established the Committee to </p><p>Inquire into Undue Arrest and Harassment (CIUAH). The </p><p>committee, which includes senior opposition party and </p><p>Tamil representatives, examines complaints of arrest and </p><p>harassment by security forces and takes remedial action </p><p>as needed. The Committee received more than 1,200 </p><p>complaints in 2001. Opinions on the effectiveness of the </p><p>CIUAH were mixed. Some human rights observers believed </p><p>that the work of the committee deterred random arrests </p><p>and alleviated problems encountered by detainees and </p><p>their families.  The role of the CIUAH diminished </p><p>drastically during the past year due to peace-process </p><p>related improvements (i.e. removing checkpoints, stopping </p><p>arrests under the PTA, and no cordon and search </p><p>operations). </p><p> </p><p>The HRC investigated the legality of detention in cases </p><p>referred to it by the Supreme Court and private citizens. </p><p>Although the HRC is legally mandated to exercise </p><p>oversight over arrests and detentions by the security </p><p>forces and to undertake visits to prisons, Members of the </p><p>security forces sometimes violated the regulations and </p><p>failed to cooperate with the HRC in the past. </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to give the ICRC unhindered </p><p>access to approximately 160 detention centers, police </p><p>stations, and army camps recognized officially as places </p><p>of detention. Due to the lapsing of the ER in July 2001, </p><p>the total number of persons detained in military bases at </p><p>any one time has been dramatically reduced, with the </p><p>military making fewer arrests and transferring detainees </p><p>to police facilities more quickly than in previous years. </p><p>With the ceasefire agreement, the number of arrests by </p><p>the military has declined to near zero. </p><p>The EPDP reportedly detained its own members for short </p><p>periods in Jaffna as punishment for breaking party </p><p>discipline. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has in the past detained civilians, often </p><p>holding them for ransom. There have been reports of this </p><p>practice during the year, such as the multiple reports of </p><p>kidnapping of Muslim businessmen in Batticaloa area, </p><p>particularly during the first four months of the year. </p><p>Reports indicate that the LTTE demand anywhere from a few </p><p>hundred dollars to upwards of $10,415 (1,000,000 Rupees) </p><p>for their release. In September 1999, the LTTE held three </p><p>businessmen for a ransom of $550,000 (40 million Rupees). </p><p>The businessmen were freed after making partial payment </p><p>and promising to pay the balance. (See Section 1.g. </p><p>regarding prisoner release.) </p><p> </p><p>The Government does not practice forced exile and there </p><p>are no legal provisions allowing its use. </p><p> </p><p>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary </p><p>and the Government generally respects these provisions in </p><p>practice. </p><p> </p><p>The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the </p><p>courts of appeal, and the high courts. A judicial service </p><p>commission, composed of the Chief Justice and two Supreme </p><p>Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower </p><p>court judges. Judges serve until the mandatory retirement </p><p>age of 65 for the Supreme Court and 62 for other courts. </p><p>Judges can be removed for reasons of misbehavior or </p><p>physical or mental incapacity, but only after a legal </p><p>investigation followed by joint action of the President </p><p>and the Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>In criminal cases, juries try defendants in public. </p><p>Defendants are informed of the charges and evidence </p><p>against them, and may be represented by the counsel of </p><p>their choice, and have the right to appeal. The </p><p>Government provides counsel for indigent persons tried on </p><p>criminal charges in the high courts and the courts of </p><p>appeal, but it does not provide counsel in other cases. </p><p>Private legal aid organizations assist some defendants. </p><p>In addition, the Ministry of Justice operates 11 </p><p>community legal aid centers to assist those who cannot </p><p>afford representation and to serve as educational </p><p>resources for local communities. These legal aid centers </p><p>had tried no cases by the end of September, however. </p><p>There are no jury trials in cases brought under the PTA. </p><p>Confessions, obtained by various coercive means, </p><p>including torture, are inadmissible in criminal </p><p>proceedings, but are allowed in PTA cases; most </p><p>convictions under the PTA rely heavily on them. </p><p>Defendants bear the burden of proof to show that their </p><p>confessions were obtained by coercion. Defendants in PTA </p><p>cases have the right to appeal. Subject to judicial </p><p>review in certain cases, defendants can spend up to 18 </p><p>months in prison on administrative order waiting for </p><p>their cases to be heard. Once their cases come to trial, </p><p>decisions are made relatively quickly. Over 750 PTA cases </p><p>were dropped by September 1 and the prisoners released. </p><p> </p><p>Most court proceedings in Colombo and the south are </p><p>conducted in English or Sinhala, which due to a shortage </p><p>of court-appointed interpreters has restricted the </p><p>ability of Tamil-speaking defendants to get a fair </p><p>hearing. Trials and hearings in the north and east are in </p><p>Tamil and English, but many serious cases, including </p><p>those having to do with terrorism, are tried in Colombo. </p><p>While Tamil-speaking judges exist at the magistrate </p><p>level, only four high court judges, an appeals court </p><p>judge, and a Supreme Court justice speak fluent Tamil. </p><p>Few legal textbooks and only one law report exist in </p><p>Tamil, and the Government has complied only slowly with </p><p>legislation requiring publishing all laws in English, </p><p>Sinhala, and Tamil. </p><p> </p><p>In Jaffna, LTTE threats against court officials sometimes </p><p>disrupted normal court operations in the past. Although </p><p>the Jaffna high court suspended activities due to </p><p>security concerns in 2000, it reopened in 2001 and was </p><p>still functioning at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has its own self-described court system, </p><p>composed of judges with little or no legal training. The </p><p>courts operate without codified or defined legal </p><p>authority and essentially operate as agents of the LTTE </p><p>rather than as an independent judiciary. The courts </p><p>reportedly impose severe punishments, including </p><p>execution. </p><p> </p><p>The Government claims that all persons held under the PTA </p><p>are suspected members of the LTTE and are, therefore, </p><p>legitimate security threats. Insufficient information </p><p>exists to verify this claim and to determine whether </p><p>these detainees are political prisoners. More than 750 </p><p>PTA cases were dismissed by the Attorney General by </p><p>September 1.  The Attorney General\'s office expected a </p><p>few more of the 222 remaining cases to be dismissed by </p><p>the end of the year.  The Government claims that the </p><p>cases that remain at that point will only be of those </p><p>individuals directly linked to suicide bombings or other </p><p>terrorist and criminal acts. In many cases, human rights </p><p>monitors question the legitimacy of the criminal charges </p><p>brought against these persons. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE also reportedly holds a number of political </p><p>prisoners. The number is impossible to determine because </p><p>of the secretive nature of the organization. The LTTE </p><p>refuses to allow the ICRC access to these prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or </p><p>Correspondence </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and </p><p>the Government generally respects this provision in </p><p>practice; however, it infringes on citizen\'s privacy </p><p>rights in some areas. The police obtain proper warrants </p><p>for arrests and searches conducted under ordinary law; </p><p>the security forces are not required to obtain warrants </p><p>for searches conducted either under the now lapsed ER or </p><p>the PTA, however. The Secretary of the Ministry of </p><p>Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such </p><p>searches. No judicial review or other means of redress </p><p>existed for alleged illegal searches under the ER. Some </p><p>Tamils complained that their homes were searched as a </p><p>means of general harassment by the security forces (see </p><p>Section 1.d.). The Government is believed to monitor </p><p>telephone conversations and correspondence on a selective </p><p>basis. </p><p> </p><p>On September 4, taking into account the fast progress of </p><p>the peace process, the Government legalized the LTTE. </p><p>The LTTE was first proscribed in 1998 following the </p><p>suicide bombing of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, one </p><p>of Sri Lanka\'s holiest sites. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens, </p><p>maintaining an effective network of informants. The LTTE </p><p>also forcibly recruited children during the year (see </p><p>Section 6.d.). During August and September, the LTTE </p><p>handed over 85 children to UNICEF, stating that the </p><p>children had volunteered to serve, but that the LTTE does </p><p>not accept children (see Section 6.d.). </p><p> </p><p>g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian </p><p>Law in Internal Conflicts </p><p> </p><p>Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE abated </p><p>with the announcement of unilateral ceasefires in </p><p>December 2001, followed by a formal ceasefire accord </p><p>being agreed to in February 2002.  On October 10, seven </p><p>civilians were killed when security force personnel fired </p><p>into a crowd storming their compound in the east.  Some </p><p>observers claim the security forces used excessive force </p><p>in repelling a peaceful crowd that was demonstrating </p><p>against the alleged harassment of LTTE cadre earlier in </p><p>the day. Others claim the security forces were justified </p><p>in repelling what appeared to be a LTTE-instigated </p><p>attack.  On April 29, in Nilaveli, on the east coast, two </p><p>Tamil women were injured when Sri Lankan Naval personnel </p><p>opened fire.  The circumstances surrounding the incident </p><p>remained unclear at year\'s end.  The investigation into </p><p>the incident remains open. </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, an estimated 2000 combatants and 100 civilians </p><p>were killed in conflict-related incidents.  In May 2001, </p><p>a 10-year-old child and the mother were injured near </p><p>Karawetti when the LTTE and SLA exchanged fire; in June, </p><p>two civilians were killed and 16 others were injured </p><p>during a 2-hour confrontation between the LTTE and the </p><p>SLA at Kawatamunai. The Sri Lankan air force carried out </p><p>a bombing campaign in the north and east during the year, </p><p>with particular intensity from June through August. The </p><p>Tamil press regularly reported the death of civilians due </p><p>to air force bombing, but there has been no confirmation </p><p>of these reports. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, the Government often publicized aspects of </p><p>its planned operations to allow civilians time to vacate </p><p>the probable areas to be affected. In 2001, the armed </p><p>forces did not give public warnings before the </p><p>commencement of operations. During 2002, there were no </p><p>military actions. In May 2000, 23 persons were killed and </p><p>dozens were injured when a bomb exploded at a Buddhist </p><p>temple in Batticaloa in the east, where crowds had </p><p>gathered to celebrate the Buddhist festival of Vesak. The </p><p>Government blamed the LTTE for this bombing, but no one </p><p>claimed responsibility. Investigations into the incident </p><p>concluded in 2001. After the bomb exploded, security </p><p>forces reportedly opened fire, killing four children and </p><p>injuring eight more. The Government maintains that the </p><p>evidence and interviews of witnesses do not support those </p><p>claims. In September 1999, the air force dropped bombs on </p><p>a village near Puthukudiyiruppu in the Vanni, killing 22 </p><p>persons (see Section 1.a.). Human rights observers </p><p>alleged that those killed were civilians. Government </p><p>officials acknowledged that the persons were killed by </p><p>air force bombs; they alleged, however, that the air </p><p>force targeted an LTTE training camp, and at first they </p><p>did not admit the possibility that civilians were killed </p><p>in error. The Government later acknowledged quietly that </p><p>the attack was an accident. During 2001, the Government </p><p>held an investigation and authorized compensation for the </p><p>victims\' families, admitting that the site had been </p><p>bombed "in error." The Government did not admit formally </p><p>to having killed civilians, however. </p><p> </p><p>On November 16, 2001, the Sri Lankan Army created the </p><p>Directorate of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in the </p><p>Sri Lankan Army. The directorate is charged with </p><p>coordinating all human rights activities for the army </p><p>from ICRC training classes (see Section 4) to overseeing </p><p>the Human Rights Cells that are assigned throughout the </p><p>military. The SLA also states that all of its personnel </p><p>have completed the appropriate training and pledged to </p><p>adhere to the "rules of international Humanitarian Law." </p><p>Early in 2002, the air force and navy instituted similar </p><p>programs.  The armed forces operate under written rules </p><p>of engagement that severely restrict the shelling, </p><p>bombardment, or other use of firepower against civilian- </p><p>occupied areas. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of 2001, the UNHCR reported a minimum of </p><p>800,000 IDP\'s in Sri Lanka due to the conflict, while the </p><p>Commissioner General for Essential Services states that </p><p>it provides services for over 700,000 persons.  Due to an </p><p>ongoing ceasefire, more than 150,000 IDPs returned to </p><p>their points of origin last year.  The Government did not </p><p>have the resources to support adequately the returnees. </p><p>In addition, many returned to areas suspected of being </p><p>mined. </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to provide food relief, through </p><p>the Commissioner General for Essential Services (CGES) </p><p>and the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies (MCPS), to </p><p>displaced and other needy citizens, including those in </p><p>areas controlled by the LTTE. Food rations were delivered </p><p>by the Government to the Vanni area through a checkpoint </p><p>that is controlled on one side by the security forces and </p><p>on the other by the LTTE. The border into the territory </p><p>controlled by the LTTE was not closed during the year. </p><p> </p><p>Prior to 2002, the Government maintained a long list of </p><p>prohibited "war-related" medical items, such as sutures, </p><p>plaster of Paris, intravenous liquid supplies, bandages, </p><p>and some drugs. At the end of the year, however, only </p><p>certain military-related items were prohibited from being </p><p>transported to LTTE controlled areas.  In the past, NGO\'s </p><p>and other groups that sought to take controlled items to </p><p>LTTE-controlled areas in the Vanni region needed </p><p>permission from local officials as well as from the </p><p>Ministry of Defense. Delays were common and approval </p><p>sometimes was denied. As a result, many medical items in </p><p>the Vanni region and Jaffna were in short supply. This </p><p>shortfall contributed to a deterioration in the quality </p><p>and quantity of medical care furnished to the civilian </p><p>population. Previous restrictions on the transport of </p><p>items such as cement, batteries, and currency into the </p><p>LTTE-controlled areas also had a negative impact on the </p><p>relief work of NGO\'s in those areas. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Defense reported capturing several LTTE </p><p>operatives in Government-controlled areas with weapons in </p><p>direct contradiction of the terms of the ceasefire </p><p>agreement.  The Government reportedly returned most LTTE </p><p>personnel thus apprehended directly to the closest LTTE </p><p>checkpoint, but some were detained for longer periods. </p><p>Previously the military  sent the cadre they captured or </p><p>who surrendered to rehabilitation centers. The ICRC </p><p>continued to visit former LTTE members in government </p><p>rehabilitation camps, although the October 2000 massacre </p><p>of more than 20 such detainees at a government-run </p><p>detention facility at Bindunuwewa, near Bandarawella, led </p><p>observers to question the continued security of residents </p><p>of these facilities (see Section 1.a. and 1.g.). </p><p> </p><p>In view of the scale of hostilities in previous years and </p><p>the large number of LTTE casualties, some observers have </p><p>found the number of prisoners taken under battlefield </p><p>conditions to be low and have concluded that many LTTE </p><p>fighters apparently were killed rather than taken </p><p>prisoner. Some observers believed that, on the government </p><p>side, an unwritten "take-no-prisoners" policy had been in </p><p>effect. The military denied this claim, stating that </p><p>other factors limited the number of prisoners taken, such </p><p>as the LTTE\'s efforts to remove injured fighters from the </p><p>battlefield, the proclivity of its fighters to choose </p><p>suicide over capture, and the LTTE\'s occasional practice </p><p>of killing its own badly injured fighters (see Section </p><p>1.a.). There were no reports of security forces personnel </p><p>executing LTTE cadres during the year. </p><p> </p><p>In previous years, the Government refused to permit </p><p>relief organizations to provide medical attention to </p><p>injured LTTE fighters, although it has offered to treat </p><p>any LTTE injured entrusted to government care. According </p><p>to credible reports, injured LTTE cadres surrendering to </p><p>the Government received appropriate medical care. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE admitted that in the past it killed security </p><p>forces personnel rather than take them prisoner. Past </p><p>eyewitness accounts confirm that the LTTE has executed </p><p>injured soldiers on the battlefield. At year\'s end, the </p><p>LTTE had reportedly released all security force personnel </p><p>they were holding. The LTTE is believed to have killed </p><p>most of the police officers and security force personnel </p><p>captured in the past few years. The LTTE in 1999 </p><p>transferred 11 captured SLA members to the ICRC. In </p><p>February 2000, the LTTE released four servicemen and in </p><p>June 2000 released one civilian. In January, the LTTE </p><p>unilaterally released 10 Sri Lankans, including some </p><p>soldiers. On September 28, the LTTE release 7 prisoners </p><p>in exchange for the release of 13 of their cadre. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE used excessive force in the war. During the </p><p>year, the LTTE has engaged in hostage taking, hijackings, </p><p>and forcible recruitment. </p><p> </p><p>In July 2001, the LTTE attacked Colombo\'s main airbase </p><p>and international airport. During the attack, the LTTE </p><p>destroyed six military and four civilian aircraft. The </p><p>LTTE also damaged the civilian airport. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, the LTTE was regularly accused of killing </p><p>civilians. For example, the LTTE was accused of killing </p><p>four Sinhalese villagers at Wahalkada village in March </p><p>2001, and killing a Tamil civilian and injuring 15 others </p><p>in Trincomalee in June of the same year (see Section </p><p>1.a.). </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE uses child soldiers. In October, four children </p><p>ranging in age from 15to 17 years surrendered to a local </p><p>church near Trincomalee after escaping from the LTTE. </p><p>Credible sources reported increased LTTE recruitment, </p><p>including recruitment of children during the year. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE expropriates food, fuel, and other items meant </p><p>for IDP\'s, thus exacerbating the plight of such persons </p><p>in LTTE-controlled areas. Malnutrition remained a problem </p><p>in LTTE-controlled areas as well as in other parts of the </p><p>Vanni region, with nutrition levels falling below the </p><p>national average. Experts have reported a high rate of </p><p>anemia and a low birth rate, both of which indicate lower </p><p>levels of nutrition. Confirmed cases of malnutrition </p><p>included hundreds of children. A survey completed by </p><p>Medecins Sans Frontieres in 1999 found malnutrition </p><p>levels in the war-affected areas at about the same level </p><p>as in the war-free south of the country, however. </p><p> </p><p>Landmines were a problem in Jaffna and the Vanni and to </p><p>some extent in the east. Landmines, booby traps, and </p><p>unexploded ordnance pose a problem to resettlement of </p><p>displaced persons and rebuilding. A U.N. landmine team </p><p>tasked with locating and mapping LTTE and army mines in </p><p>the Jaffna peninsula suspended its mission in April 2000 </p><p>stating that it was impossible to continue as long as </p><p>hostilities continued.  At year\'s end, a UN team was </p><p>again in Jaffna coordinating the process of mapping the </p><p>mined areas and establishing oversite for a mine removal </p><p>program.  The Sri Lankan Military and the LTTE are </p><p>removing mines in areas they control. The government was </p><p>reporting in excess of four mine-related casualties among </p><p>civilians per month for 2002.  In August 2001, a civilian </p><p>bus travelling to Trincomalee hit a land mine injuring 30 </p><p>of its passengers. In September 2001, a vehicle carrying </p><p>a family hit a mine approximately 5 kilometers north of </p><p>Jaffna, killing all six passengers and the driver. </p><p> </p><p>Section 2  Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: </p><p> </p><p>a. Freedom of Speech and Press </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and </p><p>expression.  In the past, the Government restricted these </p><p>rights in practice, often using national security grounds </p><p>permitted by law. The Government reissued censorship </p><p>orders, on all ongoing and future military operations, in </p><p>November 1999 after the military suffered setbacks in the </p><p>field. The Government officially lifted the censorship on </p><p>war reporting in June 2001. However, even when no </p><p>specific government censorship is exercised, private </p><p>television stations impose their own, informal censorship </p><p>on international television news rebroadcast in the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>During 2002, criminal defamation laws, which were often </p><p>used by the Government to intimidate independent media </p><p>outlets, were eliminated and all pending cases dropped. </p><p>The cases for which a decision had already been made </p><p>still stand. </p><p> </p><p>The Government controls the country\'s largest newspaper </p><p>chain, two major television stations, and the Sri Lanka </p><p>Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC, a radio station). There </p><p>are a variety of independent, privately owned newspapers, </p><p>journals and radio and television stations, most of which </p><p>freely criticize the Government and its policies. The </p><p>Government imposes no political restrictions on the </p><p>establishment of new media enterprises. </p><p> </p><p>The president officially eased censorship restrictions on </p><p>foreign journalists in a circular published in June 2000; </p><p>material for publication or broadcast within the country, </p><p>regardless of author, remained subject to government </p><p>approval until the repeal of censorship laws in June </p><p>2001, however. Claims of harassment and intimidation of </p><p>private media by the government continue. </p><p> </p><p>Human rights observers commented that in the past Tamils </p><p>from the north or east who criticized the Sri Lankan </p><p>military and Government were often harassed and sometimes </p><p>arrested. They cite the case of Thiviyan Krishnasamy, a </p><p>student leader in Jaffna and critic of the military in </p><p>the Jaffna area. He was arrested in July 2001 and </p><p>released in March 2002 (see Section 1.c). </p><p> </p><p>In September 2000, police arrested a young man for </p><p>criticizing the president on a radio call-in show. Police </p><p>traced the call to discover the caller\'s address. The </p><p>young man\'s parents alleged that he had a mental illness </p><p>and could not be held responsible for his comments. The </p><p>young man remained in prison at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>In 2000, police detained two persons for questioning in </p><p>connection with the 1999 murder of Rohana Kumara, editor </p><p>of a Sinhala-language newspaper which had been critical </p><p>of leading figures in the ruling coalition. The case </p><p>remained open at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>In February 1998, armed men attacked a journalist who </p><p>regularly reported on defense matters, including </p><p>corruption in military procurements. The Government </p><p>criticized the attack; it subsequently arrested and </p><p>indicted two air force personnel in the case, including </p><p>the bodyguard of a former Commander of the Air Force. A </p><p>formal indictment was handed down in 1999. Courts </p><p>postponed the hearings several times during the past two </p><p>years.  On February 9, the assailants were given lengthy </p><p>jail sentences. </p><p> </p><p>The Supreme Court appeal of the editor of a leading </p><p>national newspaper who was convicted of defaming the </p><p>president in 1997 was pending at the end of 2001. Other </p><p>defamation cases filed by the President against editors </p><p>of major newspapers who either had criticized the </p><p>Government or supported the opposition remained pending. </p><p>Threats of further complaints to be filed by the </p><p>Government or president continued through 2001. </p><p>Journalists viewed these cases as frivolous and intended </p><p>only to intimidate and harass the media.  In 2002, the </p><p>defamation laws permitting these cases was repealed and </p><p>the cases dropped. </p><p> </p><p>The Sri Lanka Tamil Media Alliance (SLTMA) was formed in </p><p>1999 to protect the interests of Tamil journalists, who </p><p>allege that they are subject to harassment and </p><p>intimidation by Tamil paramilitary groups and Sri Lankan </p><p>security forces. Regional Tamil correspondents working in </p><p>the war zones have complained of arbitrary arrest and </p><p>detention in the past and difficulty in obtaining press </p><p>accreditation. The SLTMA has filed cases on behalf of </p><p>Tamil journalists, but its cases have not yet succeeded </p><p>in the courts. </p><p>Prior to 2002, travel by local and foreign journalists to </p><p>conflict areas was restricted, as they were required to </p><p>obtain advance permission from the Ministry of Defense to </p><p>visit such areas. The Foreign Ministry also must approve </p><p>visits to conflict areas by foreign journalists. The LTTE </p><p>does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly </p><p>restricts the print and broadcast media in areas under </p><p>its control. The LTTE has killed those reporting and </p><p>publishing on human rights. </p><p> </p><p>The Government does not restrict access to the Internet. </p><p> </p><p>The Government generally respects academic freedom. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE does not respect academic freedom, and it has </p><p>repressed and killed intellectuals who criticize it, most </p><p>notably the moderate and widely respected Tamil </p><p>politician and academic, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, who was </p><p>killed by a suicide bomber in July 1999. The LTTE also </p><p>has severely repressed members of human rights </p><p>organizations, such as the University Teachers for Human </p><p>Rights (UTHR), and other groups. Many former members of </p><p>the UTHR have been killed. </p><p> </p><p>b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association </p><p> </p><p>The law provides for freedom of assembly and the </p><p>Government generally respects this right in practice. </p><p>Although the PTA may be used to restrict this freedom, </p><p>the Government did not use the act for that purpose </p><p>during the last two years. The ER, which lapsed in July </p><p>2001, also restricted the right of assembly.  Numerous </p><p>peaceful political and nonpolitical rallies were held </p><p>throughout Sri Lanka during the year. </p><p> </p><p>On July 19, 2001, the opposition held a rally that the </p><p>Government claimed was illegal under the 1981 Referendum </p><p>Act, which essentially states that rallies and </p><p>demonstrations of a political nature cannot be held when </p><p>a referendum is scheduled. Security forces killed two </p><p>persons when the government confronted the rally with </p><p>force, prompting further demonstrations. The Government </p><p>generally grants permits for demonstrations, however, </p><p>including those by opposition parties and minority </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>On April 30, 2001, a violent clash between the Sinhalese </p><p>and Muslim communities occurred in Mawanella. The Muslim </p><p>community protested alleged police inaction concerning </p><p>the assault on a Muslim store clerk. In response, a group </p><p>of Sinhalese attacked the Muslim protesters. As the </p><p>conflict escalated, two Muslims were killed and scores of </p><p>buildings and a few vehicles were destroyed. Police </p><p>reportedly did nothing to stop the destruction of Muslim </p><p>property. The investigation into the Mawanella incident </p><p>remained open at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>The law provides for freedom of association and the </p><p>Government respects this right in practice. Although the </p><p>PTA may restrict this right, the Government did not use </p><p>the act for that purpose during the previous two years. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE does not allow freedom of association in the </p><p>areas that it controls. The LTTE has reportedly used </p><p>coercion to make people attend rallies it sponsors.  On </p><p>the Jaffna Peninsula, the LTTE occasionally has posted in </p><p>public places the names of Tamil civilians accused of </p><p>associating with security forces and other Government </p><p>entities. The LTTE has killed Tamil civilians who have </p><p>cooperated with the security forces in establishing a </p><p>civil administration in Jaffna under a political </p><p>leadership elected freely and fairly in January 1998. </p><p> </p><p>c. Freedom of Religion </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution gives Buddhism a foremost position, but </p><p>it also provides for the right of members of other faiths </p><p>to practice their religions freely, and the Government </p><p>respects this right in practice. Despite the special </p><p>status afforded by the Constitution to Buddhism, major </p><p>religious festivals of all faiths are celebrated as </p><p>public holidays. </p><p>Foreign clergy may work in the country, but for the last </p><p>30 years, the Government has sought to limit the number </p><p>of foreign religious workers given temporary work </p><p>permits. Permission usually is restricted to </p><p>denominations registered with the Government. The </p><p>Government has prohibited the entry of new foreign clergy </p><p>on a permanent basis. It permitted those already in the </p><p>country to remain. </p><p> </p><p>Some evangelical Christians have expressed concern that </p><p>their efforts at proselytizing often meet with hostility </p><p>and harassment from the local Buddhist clergy and others </p><p>opposed to their work. During the summer, at least one </p><p>couple was physically assaulted by Buddhist clergy. </p><p>Evangelicals sometimes complain that the Government </p><p>tacitly condones such harassment, but there is no </p><p>evidence to support this claim. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE expelled virtually the entire Muslim population </p><p>from their homes in the northern part of the island in </p><p>1990. Most of these persons remain displaced. In the </p><p>past, the LTTE expropriated Muslim homes, lands, and </p><p>businesses and threatened Muslim families with death if </p><p>they attempted to return (see Section 2.d.).  In the past </p><p>year, the LTTE leadership has met with the leaders of the </p><p>Muslim community on their incorporation into the peace </p><p>process.  The LTTE has made some conciliatory statements </p><p>to the Muslim community, but the statements are viewed </p><p>with skepticism by Muslims. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE attacked Buddhist sites, most notably the </p><p>historic Dalada Maligawa or "Temple of the Tooth," the </p><p>holiest Buddhist shrine in the country, in Kandy in </p><p>January 1998. In May 2000, an LTTE bombing near a temple </p><p>at the Buddhist Vesak festival in Batticaloa killed 23 </p><p>persons and injured dozens of others (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has been accused in the past of using church and </p><p>temple compounds, where civilians were instructed by the </p><p>Government to congregate in the event of hostilities, as </p><p>shields for the storage of munitions. </p><p> </p><p>d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign </p><p>Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of </p><p>movement and of choosing his residence" and "freedom to </p><p>return to [the country]," and the Government generally </p><p>respects the right to domestic and foreign travel.  In </p><p>the past, however, the war with the LTTE prompted the </p><p>Government to impose more stringent checks on travelers </p><p>from the north and the east and on movement in Colombo, </p><p>particularly after dark. Tamils had to obtain police </p><p>passes in order to move freely in the north and east, and </p><p>frequently they were harassed at checkpoints throughout </p><p>the country (see Section 1.d.). These security measures </p><p>had the effect of restricting the movement of Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>The government has lifted most travel restrictions within </p><p>the country.  Areas near military bases and so-called </p><p>high security zones still have limited access.  Some </p><p>observers claim the high security zones are excessive and </p><p>unfairly claim Tamil lands, particularly in Jaffna.  In </p><p>April, the A-9 road connecting Jaffna in the north to the </p><p>rest of Sri Lanka was reopened.  The LTTE still puts some </p><p>limitation on travel on the road, including tolls, but </p><p>the government has lifted all of its past restrictions on </p><p>travel to Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>The armed forces initially prevented more than 1,000 </p><p>civilians from vacating conflict areas on the Jaffna </p><p>peninsula during fighting in April and May 2000; however, </p><p>the military quickly decided to permit civilians to </p><p>evacuate the area after intense pressure by human rights </p><p>groups. Fighting between Government and the LTTE has </p><p>displaced hundreds of thousands of persons, with many </p><p>displaced multiple times as front lines shifted. Since </p><p>September 2000, 172,000 IDP\'s have been living in welfare </p><p>centers ranging from camps, where conditions vary </p><p>considerably, to settlements with a full range of </p><p>government social services and food aid. By the end of </p><p>2001, an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 IDP\'s, including </p><p>those in the Vanni, had registered for government food </p><p>aid, and were receiving medicine and other essential </p><p>supplies from the Government.  By year\'s end, more than </p><p>150,000 of these IDP\'s had returned home. </p><p> </p><p>The Government has sought to resettle the displaced where </p><p>possible and has arranged for a number of those from </p><p>Jaffna to return to their homes. Over the years, the </p><p>Government, in cooperation with the UNHCR, built </p><p>permanent housing for 18,000 Muslims in the Puttalam </p><p>area. An additional one-time resettlement program </p><p>relocated 1000 families by end of 2001. Many of those </p><p>resettled later were displaced by subsequent fighting, </p><p>including those who returned to their homes north and </p><p>east of Vavuniya in 1999, but were forced to flee again </p><p>when the LTTE retook the area starting in November, 1999. </p><p>The current return of IDP\'s exceeds the capacity of the </p><p>Government to provide adequate assistance.  The IDP\'s </p><p>are, in some cases, returning to areas that are still </p><p>mined. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has discriminated against Muslims, and in 1990 </p><p>expelled some 46,000 Muslim inhabitants--virtually the </p><p>entire Muslim population--from their homes in areas under </p><p>LTTE control in the northern part of the island. Most of </p><p>these persons remained displaced and live in or near </p><p>welfare centers at year\'s end. There are credible reports </p><p>that the LTTE has warned thousands of Muslims displaced </p><p>from the Mannar area not to return to their homes until </p><p>the conflict is over. In the past, the LTTE has </p><p>expropriated Muslim homes, land, and businesses and </p><p>threatened Muslim families with death if they attempt to </p><p>return. It appears that those attacks by the LTTE are not </p><p>targeted against persons due to their religious beliefs, </p><p>however; rather, it appears that they are part of an </p><p>overall strategy to clear the north and east of persons </p><p>not sympathetic to the cause of an independent Tamil </p><p>state.  For its part, the LTTE has invited the Muslim </p><p>IDPs to return home, asserting they will not be harmed. </p><p>Although some Muslim IDPs have begun returning home, the </p><p>vast majority still do not trust the LTTE and are waiting </p><p>for a firm settlement or guarantees from the government </p><p>or international community as to their safety in LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas. </p><p> </p><p>Between October 1996 and the end of 1999, over 150,000 </p><p>persons moved out of LTTE-controlled regions through </p><p>Vavuniya and other transit points into government </p><p>controlled regions. Of these, over 100,000 reached Jaffna </p><p>and other Tamil-majority areas. Many had left the Vanni </p><p>region with the intention of proceeding south; they opted </p><p>for other destinations only after learning that they </p><p>would have to remain in transit camps until security </p><p>clearances for southward travel were obtained. Obtaining </p><p>a clearance could take up to 4 months in some cases, and </p><p>some human rights groups alleged that the procedures were </p><p>arbitrary and unreasonably strict. The Government </p><p>restricted the movement of displaced Tamils due to </p><p>possible security, economic, and social concerns. These </p><p>restrictions have basically been lifted with the onset of </p><p>the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>Prior to 2002, and following the Government\'s capture of </p><p>Jaffna in 1995, the LTTE began to allow persons to move </p><p>more freely into government-controlled areas, although it </p><p>still extracted a small fee for "travel passes" to leave </p><p>the Vanni, and it rarely allowed entire families to leave </p><p>at once. The LTTE occasionally disrupted the flow of </p><p>persons exiting the Vanni region through the one </p><p>established and legal checkpoint. In the past, the LTTE </p><p>disrupted the movement of IDP\'s from Trincomalee to </p><p>Jaffna by hijacking or attacking civilian shipping, </p><p>although there were no such reports this year. </p><p>Humanitarian groups estimate that more than 200,000 IDP\'s </p><p>live in LTTE-controlled areas (see Section 1.g.). </p><p> </p><p>Several thousand Tamils fled LTTE-controlled areas to </p><p>Tamil Nadu in southern India in 1998. An estimated 65,000 </p><p>Tamil refugees live in camps there. Approximately 100,000 </p><p>refugees may have integrated into Tamil society in India </p><p>over the years. A small number returned from India during </p><p>the year. </p><p> </p><p>The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other </p><p>humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The </p><p>issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise </p><p>during the year. The Government does not permit the entry </p><p>of refugees into the country or grant first asylum, nor </p><p>does it aid those who manage to enter to seek permanent </p><p>residence elsewhere. The law does not include provisions </p><p>for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with </p><p>the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of </p><p>Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. There were no reported </p><p>instances of forcible repatriation of persons to a </p><p>country where they feared persecution. </p><p> </p><p>Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of </p><p>Citizens to Change Their Government </p><p> </p><p>Citizens have the right to change their government </p><p>through periodic multiparty elections based on universal </p><p>adult suffrage; however, recent elections have been </p><p>marred by violence and irregularities. The country is a </p><p>longstanding democratic republic with an active </p><p>multiparty system. Power is shared between the popularly </p><p>elected President and the 225-member Parliament. The </p><p>right to change the government was last exercised in the </p><p>December 2001 parliamentary elections in which the United </p><p>National Front, a coalition of parties led by the United </p><p>National Party (UNP), won a majority in Parliament for </p><p>the next 6-year period. The December 2001 and November </p><p>2000 parliamentary elections were marred by voting </p><p>irregularities and violence. </p><p> </p><p>Following the December 2001 elections, the UNP and its </p><p>allies formed the new Government. The president\'s party, </p><p>the People\'s Alliance (PA), is now the opposition in </p><p>Parliament.  The UNP, led by Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe, has formed the new Government and filled </p><p>the positions in the cabinet.  Cohabitation ties between </p><p>the president and prime minister have been difficult. </p><p> </p><p>The president suspended Parliament from July to September </p><p>2001. The suspension of Parliament angered opposition </p><p>parties, which sponsored numerous demonstrations. One of </p><p>these demonstrations, on July 19, ended with the deaths </p><p>of two marchers killed by security forces (see Section </p><p>2.b.). After further defections from her coalition, the </p><p>President dissolved Parliament on October 10 and called </p><p>for elections to take place on December 5. </p><p>On December 5, 2001, 12 supporters of the Sri Lankan </p><p>Muslim Congress were killed, apparently by hired thugs of </p><p>a PA candidate. Former PA MP Anuruddha Ratwatte and his </p><p>two sons have been indicted for conspiracy.  In addition, </p><p>15 others, including security force personnel, were also </p><p>indicted for their alleged involvement in the murders. </p><p>The trial was still ongoing at year\'s end.  Despite an </p><p>extremely violent campaign, including credible reports on </p><p>the use of intimidation by both of the major parties, </p><p>voter turnout exceeded 70 percent. The People\'s Alliance </p><p>for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) reported 755 </p><p>incidents of violence and 49 deaths; The Center for </p><p>Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) reported 4,208 </p><p>incidents, and 73 deaths; and the police reported 2,247 </p><p>incidents, and 45 deaths during the year. </p><p> </p><p>In September 2001, the Parliament passed the 17th </p><p>Amendment, which established an independent Commission on </p><p>Elections (among other commissions), which is to be </p><p>tasked with ensuring free and fair elections. </p><p> </p><p>A delegation from the European Union monitoring the </p><p>election expressed concern about violence and </p><p>irregularities in the voting, but concluded that the </p><p>election "did to a reasonable degree reflect the will of </p><p>the electorate." </p><p> </p><p>The Commissioner of Elections recognized 46 parties at </p><p>the time of general elections in October 2000; only 13 </p><p>parties actually held seats in the 225-member Parliament </p><p>elected during 2001.  The two most influential parties, </p><p>the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (the principal component </p><p>party of the governing PA coalition) and the UNP, </p><p>generally draw their support from the majority Sinhalese </p><p>community. These two parties have alternated in power </p><p>since independence. </p><p>Although there are no legal impediments to the </p><p>participation of women in politics or government, the </p><p>social mores in some communities limit women\'s activities </p><p>outside the home, and the percentage of women in </p><p>government and politics does not correspond to their </p><p>percentage of the population. In November 1994, a woman </p><p>was elected President for the first time; she was </p><p>reelected in December 1999 for a second term. Eleven </p><p>women held seats in the Parliament that completed its </p><p>term in August 2000. In addition to the Prime Minister, </p><p>the Minister for Women\'s Affairs, and the Minister of </p><p>Social Services, a number of women held posts as deputy </p><p>ministers in the last parliament. Of the 5,000 candidates </p><p>for the October 2000 parliamentary elections, 116 were </p><p>women and 7 of them won seats in the October elections. </p><p>Only one woman (Minister of Women\'s Affairs) was </p><p>appointed to the new cabinet formed after the December 5 </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>The Parliament elected in October 2000 had 23 Tamil and </p><p>22 Muslim members.  The Parliament elected in December </p><p>2001 had 28 Tamil, 21 Muslim, and 9 women members. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE refuses to allow elections in areas under its </p><p>control, although it did not oppose campaigning by </p><p>certain Tamil parties in the east during the December </p><p>2001 parliamentary elections. In previous years the LTTE </p><p>effectively undermined the functioning of local </p><p>government bodies in Jaffna through a campaign of killing </p><p>and intimidation. This campaign included the killing of 2 </p><p>of Jaffna\'s mayors and death threats against members of </p><p>the 17 local councils. Throughout the period of the </p><p>conflict, the LTTE has killed popularly elected </p><p>politicians, including those elected by Tamils in areas </p><p>the LTTE claimed as part of a Tamil homeland. </p><p> </p><p>Section 4  Governmental Attitude Regarding International </p><p>and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations </p><p>of Human Rights </p><p> </p><p>Several domestic human rights NGO\'s, including the </p><p>Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies (CHA), the University </p><p>Teachers for Human Rights, Jaffna (UTHR-J), the Civil </p><p>Rights Movement (CRM), and the Law and Society Trust </p><p>(LST), monitor civil and political liberties. There are </p><p>no adverse regulations governing the activities of local </p><p>and foreign NGO\'s, although the Government officially </p><p>requires NGO\'s to include action plans and detailed </p><p>descriptions of funding sources as part of its </p><p>registration process. Some NGO workers have seen this as </p><p>an attempt by the Government to exert greater control </p><p>over the NGO sector after previous human rights groups </p><p>criticisms. Few NGO\'s complied with these new reporting </p><p>requirements. The Government generally cooperated with </p><p>NGO\'s, members of Parliament, and other officials </p><p>participating in seminars and other events concerning </p><p>human rights and humanitarian affairs. </p><p> </p><p>The Government allowed the ICRC unrestricted access to </p><p>detention facilities (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). The </p><p>ICRC provides international humanitarian law training </p><p>materials and training to the security forces. The UNHCR, </p><p>the ICRC, and a variety of international NGO\'s assisted </p><p>in the delivery of medical and other essential supplies </p><p>to the Vanni area (see Section 1.g.). </p><p> </p><p>In the first 6 months of the year, the HRC conducted over </p><p>600 visits to police stations and over 300 visits to </p><p>detention facilities. The HRC has over 4,500 cases of </p><p>alleged human rights abuse pending. The Commission\'s </p><p>investigation into the allegations by former Lance </p><p>Corporal Rajapakse about mass graves at Chemmani in </p><p>Jaffna resulted in exhumations in 1999 that provided the </p><p>basis for the ongoing case (see Section 1.a.). Some </p><p>observers still complain that the HRC is hampered by the </p><p>lack of a strong leader.  Over the past year, however, </p><p>many observers of commented positively on the new </p><p>leader\'s implementation of standardized procedures and </p><p>willingness to confront other government branches on </p><p>human rights issues. The new commissioners were appointed </p><p>in March 2000 and stayed in place until early 2002. </p><p>Activists have expressed some satisfaction with the new </p><p>leadership\'s prompt investigation into the November 2000 </p><p>Bindunuwewu massacre. </p><p> </p><p>Section 5  Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, </p><p>Disability, Language, or Social Status </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for equal rights under the law </p><p>for all citizens, and the Government generally respects </p><p>these rights. The Supreme Court regularly upholds court </p><p>rulings in cases in which individuals file suit over the </p><p>abridgment of their fundamental civil rights. The HRC and </p><p>the CIUAH are other mechanisms that the Government has </p><p>established to ensure enforcement of constitutional </p><p>provisions in addition to access to the courts (see </p><p>Section 1.d.). </p><p> </p><p>Women </p><p> </p><p>Sexual assault, rape, and spousal abuse (often associated </p><p>with alcohol abuse) continued to be serious and pervasive </p><p>problems. </p><p> </p><p>Amendments to the Penal Code introduced in 1995 </p><p>specifically addressed sexual abuse and exploitation and </p><p>modified rape laws to create a more equitable burden of </p><p>proof and to make punishments more stringent. Marital </p><p>rape is considered an offense in cases of spouses living </p><p>under judicial separation, and laws govern sexual </p><p>molestation and sexual harassment in the workplace. While </p><p>the Penal Code may ease some of the problems faced by </p><p>victims of sexual assault, many women\'s organizations </p><p>believe that greater sensitization of police and judicial </p><p>officials is required. The Government set up the Bureau </p><p>for the Protection of Children and Women within the </p><p>police in 1994 to respond to calls for greater awareness </p><p>and attention; however, there was no information on any </p><p>actions taken by the Bureau nor on the number of crimes </p><p>against women. </p><p> </p><p>Although laws against procuring and trafficking were </p><p>strengthened in 1995, trafficking in women for the </p><p>purpose of forced labor occurs (see Sections 6.c. and </p><p>6.f.). </p><p> </p><p>During 2001, police reported 500 rape case </p><p>investigations.  In 2001, there were a number of reports </p><p>of security forces raping women in custody (see Section </p><p>1.c.). In 2002, there was one such report. There have </p><p>been no convictions in the cases involving security force </p><p>personnel. </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for equal employment </p><p>opportunities in the public sector. However, women have </p><p>no legal protection against discrimination in the private </p><p>sector where they sometimes are paid less than men for </p><p>equal work, often experience difficulty in rising to </p><p>supervisory positions, and face sexual harassment. Women </p><p>constitute approximately one-half of the formal work </p><p>force. </p><p> </p><p>Women have equal rights under national, civil, and </p><p>criminal law. However, questions related to family law, </p><p>including divorce, child custody, and inheritance, are </p><p>adjudicated by the customary law of each ethnic or </p><p>religious group. The minimum age of marriage for women is </p><p>18 years, except in the case of Muslims, who continue to </p><p>follow their customary marriage practices. The </p><p>application of different legal practices based on </p><p>membership in a religious or ethnic group often results </p><p>in discrimination against women. </p><p> </p><p>Children </p><p> </p><p>The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and </p><p>rights of children, but is constrained by a lack of </p><p>resources. The Government demonstrates this commitment </p><p>through its extensive systems of public education and </p><p>medical care. The law requires children between the ages </p><p>of 5 and 14 to attend school. Approximately 85 percent of </p><p>children under the age of 16 attend school. Education is </p><p>free through the university level. Health care, including </p><p>immunization, also is free. </p><p> </p><p>In the period from January 1 to June 30, 2000, the police </p><p>recorded 680 cases of crimes against children, compared </p><p>with 767 cases for January 1 to the end of August. Many </p><p>NGO\'s attribute the problem of exploitation of children </p><p>to the lack of law enforcement rather than adequate </p><p>legislation. In the past many law enforcement resources </p><p>were diverted to the conflict with the LTTE, although the </p><p>police\'s Bureau for the Protection of Children and Women </p><p>conducts investigations into crimes against these two </p><p>groups.  In September, the Police also opened an office </p><p>to work directly with the National Child Protection </p><p>Authority (NCPA) on children\'s issues. </p><p> </p><p>There is a problem of child prostitution in certain </p><p>coastal resort areas. The Government estimates that there </p><p>are more than 2,000 active child prostitutes in the </p><p>country, but private groups claim that the number is much </p><p>higher (see Section 6.f.). The bulk of child sexual abuse </p><p>in the form of child prostitution is committed by </p><p>citizens; however, some child prostitutes are boys who </p><p>cater to foreign tourists. Some of these children are </p><p>forced into prostitution (see Section 6.f.). The </p><p>Government has pushed for greater international </p><p>cooperation to bring those guilty of pedophilia to </p><p>justice. The penalty for pedophilia is not less than 5 </p><p>years and up to 20 years as well as an unspecified fine. </p><p>Four cases of pedophilia were brought to court in 2000, </p><p>one involving a foreigner. At least two cases were </p><p>brought to court in 2002 but the accused fled the country </p><p>in each case.  There was at least one reported arrest for </p><p>pedophilia during the year, but no convictions. </p><p> </p><p>Regular employment of children also occurs in the </p><p>informal sector and in family enterprises (see Section </p><p>6.d.). Government inspections have been unable to </p><p>eliminate these forms of child labor, although an </p><p>awareness campaign coupled with the establishment of hot </p><p>lines for reporting child labor has led to an increase in </p><p>the prosecutions by the Labor Department regarding child </p><p>labor violations. However, many thousands of children are </p><p>believed to be employed in domestic service, although </p><p>this situation is not regulated or documented. Many child </p><p>domestics are reportedly subjected to physical, sexual </p><p>and emotional abuse. Internal trafficking in male </p><p>children for the purpose of prostitution is a problem </p><p>(see Sections 6.d. and 6.f.). </p><p> </p><p>The Government created the National Child Protection </p><p>Authority (NCPA) in 1998. The law establishing the NCPA </p><p>consolidated existing legislation and defined a child as </p><p>anyone under age 18. Under the law, the definition of </p><p>child abuse includes all acts of sexual violence against, </p><p>trafficking in, and cruelty to children. The law also </p><p>prohibits the use of children in exploitative labor or </p><p>illegal activities or in any act contrary to compulsory </p><p>education regulations. The legislation further widened </p><p>the definition of child abuse to include the involvement </p><p>of children in war. The NCPA is comprised of </p><p>representatives from the education, medical, retired </p><p>police, and legal professions; it reports directly to the </p><p>President. The police also created an office in September </p><p>to work directly with the NCPA, particularly in </p><p>investigations of incidents the NCPA reports to them.  In </p><p>the past, the LTTE used child soldiers and recruits </p><p>children, sometimes forcibly, for use in battlefield </p><p>support functions and in combat. LTTE recruits, some as </p><p>young as 13, have surrendered to the military, and </p><p>credible reports indicate the LTTE has stepped up </p><p>recruiting efforts (see Section 1.g.). In May 1998, the </p><p>LTTE gave assurances to the Special Representative of the </p><p>U.N. Secretary General for Children in Armed Combat that </p><p>it would not recruit children under the age of 17. The </p><p>LTTE has not honored this pledge, even after the </p><p>ceasefire agreement there were multiple credible reports </p><p>of the LTTE forcibly recruiting children (see Section </p><p>6.d.). </p><p> </p><p>Persons with Disabilities </p><p> </p><p>The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or </p><p>government services for persons with disabilities. The </p><p>World Health Organization estimates that 7 percent of the </p><p>population is persons with disabilities. Most persons </p><p>with disabilities, who are unable to work, are cared for </p><p>by their families. The Department of Social Services </p><p>operates eight vocational training schools for persons </p><p>with physical and mental disabilities and sponsors a </p><p>program of job training and placement for graduates. The </p><p>Government also provides some financial support to NGO\'s </p><p>that assist persons with disabilities; subsidizes </p><p>prosthetic devices and other medical aids for persons </p><p>with disabilities; makes some purchases from suppliers </p><p>with disabilities; and has registered 74 schools and </p><p>training institutions for persons with disabilities run </p><p>by NGO\'s. The Social Services Ministry has selected job </p><p>placement officers to help the estimated 200,000 work- </p><p>eligible persons with disabilities find jobs. In spite of </p><p>these efforts, persons with disabilities still face </p><p>difficulties because of negative attitudes and societal </p><p>discrimination. In 1996 Parliament passed legislation </p><p>forbidding discrimination against any person on the </p><p>grounds of disability. No cases are known to have been </p><p>filed under this law. </p><p> </p><p>Indigenous People </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s indigenous people, known as Veddas, number </p><p>fewer than l,000. Some prefer to maintain their isolated </p><p>traditional way of life, and they are protected by the </p><p>Constitution. There are no legal restrictions on their </p><p>participation in the political or economic life of the </p><p>nation. In August 1998, the Government fulfilled a long- </p><p>standing Vedda demand when the president issued an order </p><p>granting Veddas the right to hunt and gather in specific </p><p>protected forest areas. The executive order granted the </p><p>Veddas the freedom to protect their culture and to carry </p><p>on their traditional way of life without hindrance. Under </p><p>a pilot program, Veddas received special identity cards </p><p>to enable their use of these forest areas. Some Veddas </p><p>still complain that they are being pushed off of their </p><p>land. </p><p> </p><p>Religious Minorities </p><p> </p><p>Discrimination based on religious differences seems much </p><p>less common than discrimination based on ethnicity or </p><p>caste. In general, the members of the various faiths tend </p><p>to be tolerant of each other\'s religious beliefs. </p><p>However, on occasion, Christians have been harassed by </p><p>Buddhist monks for their alleged attempts to convert </p><p>Buddhists to Christianity. Catholic clergy, for example, </p><p>have reported non-violent incidents of this sort in the </p><p>south during the year.  Evangelical Christians were </p><p>physically assaulted on at least one occasion. In the </p><p>past, evangelical Christians have reported similar </p><p>incidents (see Section 2.c.). </p><p> </p><p>There are reports that members of various religious </p><p>groups give preference in hiring in the private sector to </p><p>members of their own group or denomination. This practice </p><p>likely is linked to the country\'s ongoing ethnic problems </p><p>and does not appear to be based principally on religion. </p><p>There is no indication of preference in employment in the </p><p>public sector on the basis of religion. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2001, three Sinhalese men attacked a Muslim </p><p>cashier in Mawanella. The Muslim community protested </p><p>police inaction regarding the attack. In response </p><p>approximately 2,000 Sinhalese, including Buddhist monks, </p><p>rioted in the Muslim section of town and confronted the </p><p>Muslim protesters. Two Muslims were killed, and a number </p><p>of buildings and vehicles were destroyed. The Muslim </p><p>community throughout the western portion of the country </p><p>staged a number of protests claiming the police did </p><p>nothing to prevent the riot. Some of the protests </p><p>resulted in clashes between the Muslim and Sinhalese </p><p>communities. </p><p>The LTTE has attacked notable Buddhist sites. In May </p><p>2000, 23 persons were killed and dozens injured when an </p><p>LTTE bomb exploded near a temple at the Buddhist Vesak </p><p>festival. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the LTTE allowed Roman Catholics unlimited </p><p>access to a shrine at Madhu in the north. Thousands of </p><p>pilgrims took the opportunity to visit the shrine. </p><p> </p><p>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities </p><p> </p><p>There are approximately one million Tamils of </p><p>comparatively recent Indian origin, the so-called "tea </p><p>estate" Tamils or "Indian" Tamils, whose ancestors </p><p>originally were brought to the country in the 19th </p><p>century to work on plantations. Approximately 75,000 of </p><p>these persons do not qualify for either Indian or Sri </p><p>Lankan citizenship and face discrimination, especially in </p><p>the allocation of government funds for education. Without </p><p>national identity cards, they also are vulnerable to </p><p>arrest by the security forces. However, the Government </p><p>has stated that none of these persons would be forced to </p><p>depart the country. During 1999, the Government </p><p>introduced a program to begin registering these </p><p>individuals; 15,300 tea estate Tamils received identity </p><p>cards between January and September 30, 2001. Some </p><p>critics charged that the program did not progress fast </p><p>enough. </p><p> </p><p>Both Sri Lankan and tea estate Tamils maintain that they </p><p>have long suffered systematic discrimination in </p><p>university education, government employment, and in other </p><p>matters controlled by the Government. Section 6  Worker </p><p>Rights </p><p> </p><p>a. The Right of Association </p><p> </p><p>The Government respects the constitutional right of </p><p>workers to establish unions, and the country has a strong </p><p>trade union tradition. Any seven workers may form a </p><p>union, adopt a charter, elect leaders, and publicize </p><p>their views; however, in practice, such rights can be </p><p>subject to administrative delays, and are unofficially </p><p>discouraged. Nonetheless, approximately 25 percent of the </p><p>6.7 million person work force nationwide and more than 70 </p><p>percent of the plantation work force, which is </p><p>overwhelmingly Hill Tamil, is unionized. In total there </p><p>are more than 1,000,000 union members, 650,000 of whom </p><p>are women. Approximately 20 percent of the </p><p>nonagricultural work force in the private sector is </p><p>unionized. Unions represent most workers in large private </p><p>firms, but those in small-scale agriculture and small </p><p>businesses usually do not belong to unions. Public sector </p><p>employees are unionized at very high rates and are highly </p><p>politicized. </p><p> </p><p>Most large unions are affiliated with political parties </p><p>and play a prominent role in the political process, </p><p>though major unions in the public sector are politically </p><p>independent. More than 30 labor unions have political </p><p>affiliations, but there are also a small number of </p><p>unaffiliated unions, some of which have active leaders </p><p>and a relatively large membership. In 2000 the most </p><p>recent year for which data is available, the Department </p><p>of Labor registered 183 new unions and canceled the </p><p>registration of 132 others, bringing the total number of </p><p>functioning unions to 1,604. The Ministry of Labor is </p><p>authorized by law to cancel the registration of any union </p><p>that does not submit an annual report. This requirement </p><p>is the only legal grounds for cancellation of </p><p>registration. </p><p> </p><p>All workers, other than civil servants and workers in </p><p>"essential" services, have the right to strike. By law </p><p>workers may lodge complaints with the Commissioner of </p><p>Labor, a labor tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect </p><p>their rights. These mechanisms are effective; however, </p><p>there can be lengthy delays in the resolution of cases. </p><p>New reforms put limits on the amount of time allowed to </p><p>resolve arbitration cases, though there is a substantial </p><p>backlog to clear.  The Government periodically has </p><p>controlled strikes by declaring some industries essential </p><p>under the ER (which lapsed in July 2000). The President </p><p>retains the power to designate any industry as an </p><p>essential service. The ILO has pointed out to the </p><p>Government that essential services should be limited to </p><p>services where an interruption would endanger the life, </p><p>personal safety, or health of the population. </p><p> </p><p>Civil servants collectively may submit labor grievances </p><p>to the Public Service Commission, but they have no legal </p><p>grounds to strike. Nonetheless, government workers in the </p><p>transportation, medical, educational, power generation, </p><p>financial, and port sectors have staged brief strikes and </p><p>other work actions in the past few years. There were </p><p>numerous public sector strikes during the year. </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits retribution against strikers in </p><p>nonessential sectors. Employers may dismiss workers only </p><p>for disciplinary reasons, mainly misconduct. Incompetence </p><p>or low productivity are not grounds for dismissal. </p><p>Dismissed employees have a right to appeal their </p><p>termination before a labor tribunal. </p><p> </p><p>Unions may affiliate with international bodies, and some </p><p>have done so. The Ceylon Workers Congress, composed </p><p>exclusively of Hill Tamil plantation workers, is the only </p><p>trade union organization affiliated with the </p><p>International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), </p><p>although a new trade union in the Biyagama export </p><p>processing zone (EPZ) is affiliated with the Youth Forum </p><p>of the ICFTU. No national trade union center exists to </p><p>centralize or facilitate contact with international </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively </p><p> </p><p>The law provides for the right to collective bargaining, </p><p>but fewer than 100 companies rely on it. Large firms may </p><p>have employees in as many as 60 different unions. In </p><p>enterprises without unions, including those in the EPZ\'s, </p><p>worker councils--composed of employees, employers and </p><p>often a public sector representative--generally provide </p><p>the forums for labor and management negotiation. The </p><p>councils do not have the power to negotiate binding </p><p>contracts, and labor advocates have criticized them as </p><p>ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>In December 1999, Parliament passed an amendment to the </p><p>Industrial Disputes Act to require employers to recognize </p><p>trade unions and the right to collective bargaining. The </p><p>law prohibits antiunion discrimination. This law is being </p><p>implemented. Employers found guilty of such </p><p>discrimination must reinstate workers fired for union </p><p>activities but may transfer them to different locations. </p><p> </p><p>There are approximately 110,000 workers employed in three </p><p>EPZ\'s, a large percentage of them women. Under the law, </p><p>workers in the EPZ\'s have the same rights to join unions </p><p>as other workers. Few unions have formed in the EPZs, </p><p>partially because of severe restrictions on access by </p><p>union organizers to the zones. While the unionization </p><p>rate in the rest of the country is approximately 25 </p><p>percent, the rate within the EPZs is only 10 percent. </p><p>Labor representatives allege that the Government\'s Board </p><p>of Investment, which manages the EPZs, including setting </p><p>wages and working conditions in the EPZs, has discouraged </p><p>union activity. The short-term nature of employment and </p><p>relatively young workforce in the zones makes it </p><p>difficult to organize.  Work councils in the EPZs are </p><p>chaired by the Government\'s Board of Investment (BOI) and </p><p>only have the power to make recommendations. Labor </p><p>representatives also allege that the Labor Commissioner, </p><p>under BOI pressure, has failed to prosecute employers who </p><p>refuse to recognize or enter into collective bargaining </p><p>with trade unions. While employers in the EPZs offer </p><p>generally higher wages and better working conditions than </p><p>employers elsewhere, workers face other concerns, such as </p><p>security, expensive but low quality boarding houses, and </p><p>sexual harassment. In most instances, wage boards </p><p>establish minimum wages and conditions of employment, </p><p>except in the EPZs, where wages and work conditions are </p><p>set by the BOI. </p><p> </p><p>c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor </p><p> </p><p>Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited under the law; </p><p>however, there were reports of the use of forced or </p><p>compulsory labor. ILO Convention 105 was not ratified yet </p><p>by the end of September.  There are reports of women </p><p>being trafficked to the country for the purpose of </p><p>prostitution (see Section 6.f.). Some children reportedly </p><p>were trafficked and forced into prostitution (see </p><p>Sections 5 and 6.f.). The law does not prohibit forced or </p><p>bonded labor by children specifically, but government </p><p>officials interpret it as applying to persons of all </p><p>ages. There were credible reports that some rural </p><p>children were employed in debt bondage as domestic </p><p>servants in urban households.  There were many reports </p><p>that some of these children had been abused. </p><p> </p><p>There are credible reports that some soldiers attached to </p><p>an army camp north of Batticaloa forced local villagers </p><p>to build a wall around the camp during 2000, and that </p><p>they beat individuals who refused to comply. The military </p><p>apparently transferred the officer responsible for the </p><p>forced labor when the abuse was publicized. </p><p> </p><p>d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for </p><p>Employment </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits labor by children under 14 years of </p><p>age, but child labor is a problem and still exists in the </p><p>informal sectors. The National Child Protection Authority </p><p>Act (NCPA) combats the problem of child abuse, including </p><p>unlawful child labor. The act consolidated existing </p><p>legislation that established what types of employment are </p><p>restricted for children, which age groups are affected. </p><p>The Ministry of Labor is the competent authority to set </p><p>regulations, carry out implementation, and monitoring. </p><p>The minimum age for employment is 14, although the law </p><p>permits the employment of younger children by their </p><p>parents or guardians in limited work. In January 2000, </p><p>Parliament repealed a regulation that permitted domestic </p><p>employment for children as young as age 12. The law </p><p>permits the employment of persons from the age of 14 for </p><p>not more than one hour on any day before school. The </p><p>Trade Union Ordinance of 1935 allows membership only from </p><p>the age of 16, however.  The law also permits employment </p><p>in any school or institution for training purposes. The </p><p>Compulsory Attendance at Schools Act, which requires </p><p>children between the ages of 5 and 14 to attend school, </p><p>has been in effect since January 1998, although it still </p><p>is being implemented. Despite legislation, child labor </p><p>still exists in the informal sector. A child activity </p><p>survey carried out in 1998 and 1999 by the Department of </p><p>Census and Statistics found almost 11,000 children </p><p>between the ages of 5 and 14 working full time and </p><p>another 15,000 engaged in both economic activity and </p><p>housekeeping. The survey found 450,000 children employed </p><p>by their families in seasonal agricultural work. </p><p> </p><p>Persons under age 16 may not be employed in any public </p><p>enterprise in which life or limb is endangered. There are </p><p>no reports that children are employed in the EPZs, the </p><p>garment industry, or any other export industry, although </p><p>children sometimes are employed during harvest periods in </p><p>the plantation sectors and in nonplantation agriculture. </p><p>A 1995 labor survey of the plantations indicated that </p><p>half of all children in plantations drop out of school </p><p>after the fourth grade, leaving a large pool of children </p><p>between the ages of 10 and 15 available to pursue </p><p>employment.  The primary school retention rate has been </p><p>increasing in recent years. </p><p> </p><p>Many thousands of children are believed to be employed in </p><p>domestic service, although this situation is not </p><p>regulated or documented. A 1997 study reported that child </p><p>domestic servants are employed in 8.6 percent of homes in </p><p>the Southern Province. The same study reported that child </p><p>laborers in the domestic service sector often are </p><p>deprived of an education. Many child domestics are </p><p>reportedly subjected to physical, sexual, and emotional </p><p>abuse. </p><p> </p><p>Regular employment of children also occurs in the </p><p>informal sector and in family enterprises such as family </p><p>farms, crafts, small trade establishments, restaurants, </p><p>and repair shops. Government inspections have been unable </p><p>to eliminate these forms of child labor (see Section 5), </p><p>although an awareness campaign coupled with the </p><p>establishment of hot lines for reporting child labor has </p><p>led to an increase in the prosecutions regarding child </p><p>labor violations by the Labor Department. The Labor </p><p>Department reported 194 complaints regarding child labor </p><p>in 2000, with 79 of these cases withdrawn due to lack of </p><p>evidence or faulty complaints. The Department prosecuted </p><p>7 cases in 2000. In the first eight months of the year, </p><p>the Labor Department reported 199 complaints, with 48 </p><p>cases withdrawn and 40 prosecuted. According to the </p><p>Ministry of Labor, there were 10 prosecutions for child </p><p>labor (below the age of 14) during 2000. Under </p><p>legislation dating from 1956, the maximum penalty for </p><p>employing minors is about $12 (1,000 rupees), with a </p><p>maximum jail term of 6 months. </p><p> </p><p>Internal trafficking in male children for the purpose of </p><p>prostitution is a problem (see Sections 5 and 6.f.). </p><p>Estimates of the number of child prostitutes range from </p><p>2,000 to 30,000; however, there are no reliable </p><p>statistics. Although forced or bonded labor by persons of </p><p>any age is prohibited by law, some rural children </p><p>reportedly have served in debt bondage (see Sections 5 </p><p>and 6.c.). The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on </p><p>the Worst Forms of Child Labor on March 1, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE continued to use high school-age children for </p><p>work as cooks, messengers, and clerks. In some cases, the </p><p>children reportedly help build fortifications. In the </p><p>past, children as young as age 10 were said to be </p><p>recruited and placed for 2 to 4 years in special schools </p><p>that provided them with a mixture of LTTE ideology and </p><p>formal education. The LTTE uses children as young as 13 </p><p>years of age in battle, and children sometimes are </p><p>recruited forcibly into the LTTE (see Section 5). In May </p><p>1999, the LTTE began a program of compulsory physical </p><p>training, including mock military drills, for most of the </p><p>population of the areas that it controls, including for </p><p>schoolchildren and the aged. This LTTE program reportedly </p><p>still functions. According to LTTE spokesmen, this work </p><p>is meant to keep the population fit; however, it is </p><p>believed widely that the training was established in </p><p>order to gain tighter control over the population and to </p><p>provide a base for recruiting fighters.  Despite repeated </p><p>claims to the contrary by the LTTE, there were credible </p><p>reports that the LTTE continued to forcibly recruit </p><p>children throughout the year.  Individuals or small </p><p>groups of children intermittently turned themselves over </p><p>to security forces or religious leaders saying they had </p><p>escaped LTTE training camps throughout the year.  During </p><p>August and September, the LTTE handed over 85 children to </p><p>UNICEF, stating that the children had volunteered to </p><p>serve, but that the LTTE does not accept children. </p><p> </p><p>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces the minimum </p><p>wage law for large companies through routine inspections; </p><p>however, staffing shortages prevent the department from </p><p>effectively monitoring the informal sector. While there </p><p>is no universal national minimum wage, approximately 40 </p><p>wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions by </p><p>sector and industry. In 2001, minimum wage rates averaged </p><p>approximately $29.38 (2,625 rupees) per month in </p><p>industry, commerce, and the service sector. The rate was </p><p>approximately $1.38 (104.53 rupees) per day in </p><p>agriculture. The minimum wage in the garment industry was </p><p>$25.73 (2,300 rupees) per month. These minimum wages are </p><p>insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a </p><p>worker and the standard family of five, but the vast </p><p>majority of families have more than one breadwinner. </p><p> </p><p>Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that </p><p>prohibit them from regularly working more than 45 hours </p><p>per week (a 5 1/2-day workweek). Overtime is limited to </p><p>60 hours per month under a recent ruling.  Labor </p><p>organizers are concerned that the new legislation does </p><p>not include a provision for overtime to be done with the </p><p>consent of the worker.  Such workers also receive 14 days </p><p>of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and </p><p>approximately 20 local holidays each year. Maternity </p><p>leave is available for permanent and seasonal or part- </p><p>time female workers. Several laws protect the safety and </p><p>health of industrial workers, but the Ministry of Labor\'s </p><p>small staff of inspectors is inadequate to enforce </p><p>compliance with the laws. Workers have the statutory </p><p>right to remove themselves from situations that endanger </p><p>their health, but many workers are unaware of, or </p><p>indifferent to, health risks, and fear that they would </p><p>lose their jobs if they removed themselves. Health and </p><p>safety regulations do not meet international standards. </p><p>f. Trafficking in Persons </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits trafficking in persons; however, Sri </p><p>Lanka is a country of origin and destination for </p><p>trafficked persons, primarily women and children for the </p><p>purposes of forced labor, and possibly for sexual </p><p>exploitation. Sri Lankan women travel to Middle Eastern </p><p>countries to work as domestics and some have reported </p><p>being forced into domestic servitude and sexual </p><p>exploitation. Some Sri Lankan children are trafficked </p><p>internally to work as domestics and in some cases for </p><p>sexual exploitation. There were unconfirmed reports that </p><p>boys were trafficked to the Middle East as camel jockeys. </p><p>According to police reports, there has been a floating </p><p>pool of approximately 200 foreign female sex workers in </p><p>the country who may have been trafficked from the former </p><p>Soviet Union, Thailand, and China. </p><p> </p><p>Internal trafficking in male children is also a problem, </p><p>especially from areas bordering the northern and eastern </p><p>provinces. Protecting Environment and Children Everywhere </p><p>(PEACE), a domestic NGO, estimates that in 2001 there </p><p>were at least 5,000 male children between the ages of 8 </p><p>and 15 years who are engaged as sex workers both at beach </p><p>and mountain resorts. Some of these children are forced </p><p>into prostitution by their parents or by organized crime </p><p>(see Section 5). PEACE also reports that an additional </p><p>7,000 young men aged 15 to 18 years are self-employed </p><p>prostitutes.  Many organizations believe the PEACE </p><p>numbers to be inflated. </p><p> </p><p>On October 1, the Police opened an office to work as part </p><p>of the NCPA in children\'s issues, including trafficking </p><p>in children. </p><p> </p><p>Penal Code amendments enacted in 1995 provide for </p><p>penalties for trafficking in women including imprisonment </p><p>for 2 to 20 years, and a fine. For trafficking in </p><p>children, the law allows imprisonment of 5 to 20 years, </p><p>and a fine. </p><p> </p><p>The Government took action during 2001 to prepare a </p><p>national plan to combat the trafficking of children. The </p><p>project was part of a regional project funded by the ILO. </p><p> </p><p>The country has a reputation as a destination for foreign </p><p>pedophiles. Officials believe that approximately 30 </p><p>percent of the clients are tourists and 70 percent are </p><p>locals. The Government occasionally prosecuted foreign </p><p>pedophiles, and there have been some convictions; however </p><p>there were no such convictions during the year. Many </p><p>NGO\'s attribute the problem of child exploitation to a </p><p>lack of law enforcement. There is evidence of continuing, </p><p>but reduced, international interest in Sri Lankan </p><p>children for the sex trade as evidenced in tourism by </p><p>foreign pedophiles, and in Internet sites featuring child </p><p>pornography involving the country\'s children. </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>3.
