<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS ASSERT WILLINGNESS TO MOVE FORWARD DURING </p><p>BRUCE JACKSON\'S VISIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified -- Protect Accordingly </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: During a June 1-4 visit to Ankara, </p><p>President of the Project on Transitional Democracies Bruce </p><p>Jackson urged Turkish officials to consider a wider, European </p><p>context as it pursues foreign policy over the next 18 months. </p><p> GOT interlocutors embraced Jackson\'s message and seemed </p><p>willing to move forward on a host of issues.  Although </p><p>Jackson suggested that the GOT not dwell only on Iraq and </p><p>look to other areas in which to take steps, Turks across the </p><p>board were eager to discuss GOT Iraq policy in the run up to </p><p>war as largely a reflection of the blame game, still underway </p><p>in Ankara, that makes rapid action difficult.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Message </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a June 1-4 visit to Ankara, President of the </p><p>Project on Transitional Democracies Bruce Jackson met with a </p><p>variety of senior Turkish government officials (including </p><p>Justice Minister Cicek, MFA U/S Ziyal, P.M. Erdogan advisor </p><p>Davutoglu, and AK vice chairman for foreign affairs Disli), </p><p>TGS J-5 Gen. Turgut, and press.  Jackson outlined his </p><p>organization\'s vision of a united, democratic Europe -- </p><p>including western Balkans, Ukraine, and Caucasus -- and </p><p>Turkey\'s key role in completing that vision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Jackson urged Turkish officials to consider the big </p><p>picture as key deadlines, such as the December 2004 EU </p><p>summit, are approaching.  He encouraged them to take concrete </p><p>steps quickly both internally and regionally to help </p><p>strengthen trans-atlantic ties and to bring Europe together. </p><p>As an example, Jackson suggested that Turkey contribute </p><p>immediately to a solution in Nagorno-Karabakh.  On </p><p>Turkey-U.S. relations, Jackson noted that personal </p><p>relationships matter and that Turkey should seek to explore </p><p>ways -- other than in Iraq -- that it can help build stronger </p><p>U.S. ties.  Jackson stressed that the important thing will be </p><p>to achieve early successes to create momentum that will carry </p><p>over into more sensitive issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Turks receptive... </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Across the board, GOT officials were eager to </p><p>express their willingness to move forward on a variety of </p><p>issues.  Offering a representative view, Disli began his </p><p>meeting with Jackson by asking, "How can we make things </p><p>better?"  Minister Cicek agreed with Jackson that </p><p>U.S.-Turkish cooperation in southeastern Europe is key to </p><p>regional stability.  He also added, "we are ready to help out </p><p>in every way in the Middle East."  Noting his appreciation of </p><p>USG support for Turkey\'s EU membership, Davutoglu said that </p><p>the GOT shares Jackson\'s view of the significance of </p><p>transatlantic cooperation in the European project.  Echoing </p><p>Jackson, Davutoglu said that the current institutional </p><p>constellations in the western Balkans should be expanded to </p><p>the Black Sea region and Caucasus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) MFA officials also, in large part, embraced </p><p>Jackson\'s message.  MFA U/S Ziyal said Turkey will continue </p><p>its regional work to move "from survival to quality of life </p><p>issues" -- i.e. to eliminate regional security concerns and </p><p>to focus on development.  In a forward-leaning presentation </p><p>to Jackson, MFA DDG for European Affairs Yenel outlined a </p><p>clear strategy for the run-up to December 2004.  The GOT, </p><p>Yenel explained, understands that it must pass all of the </p><p>legislation for EU political criteria this year and will work </p><p>on implementation next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>... But Still Defensive on Iraq </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Although Jackson repeatedly attempted to steer </p><p>discussions away from Iraq, our interlocutors felt compelled </p><p>to defend Turkey\'s policy prior to and during Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom.  Without prompting from Jackson, Turkish officials </p><p>spoke as if from the same talking points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Minister Cicek, Disli, Amb. Ender Arat -- foreign affairs </p><p>advisor to Erdogan -- and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman </p><p>Mehmet Dulger cited Turkey\'s losses in the first Gulf War and </p><p>the distribution of political cartoons disparaging F.M. Gul </p><p>as factors playing on the minds of M.P.s and thus </p><p>contributing to the failure of March 1; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Arat further noted that Kurdish opposition groups in N. </p><p>Iraq held anti-Turkish demonstrations on March 1; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Disli and MFA Deputy U/S Banguoglu claimed that, in any </p><p>case, Turkey had contributed more to USG efforts in Iraq than </p><p>any other country except the U.K.; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) More informally over dinner at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>residence, our contacts were more willing to point out other, </p><p>more substantial factors.  Opposition DYP vice chairman </p><p>Ensarioglu stated that the AK government\'s March 1 motion </p><p>contrasted with the "policy of the State."  Columnist Cuneyt </p><p>Ulsever highlighted "military foot-dragging" and also </p><p>rejected the polite explanation offered by AK\'s Reha Denemec, </p><p>who had focused on parliamentary procedural and arithmetical </p><p>obstacles in the voting process.  Seconding Ulsever\'s point, </p><p>AK M.P. Ersonmez Yarbay, a long-time contact, observed in an </p><p>aside to us that Denemec was unwilling to air Turkey\'s dirty </p><p>laundry "in front of strangers" -- a point later volunteered </p><p>privately by Denemec himself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In their meetings with Jackson, Turkish officials of </p><p>all stripes clearly indicated a willingness to move forward </p><p>but, in many cases, were unable to express in concrete terms </p><p>how they will do that.  On normalizing relations with </p><p>Armenia, for example, our interlocutors recognize the need </p><p>for progress but continue to hew to the line that Armenia </p><p>must make the first move.  We will continue to press our GOT </p><p>contacts to move beyond words to concrete policy initiatives. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
