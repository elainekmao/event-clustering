<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 14032 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, KPAL,, </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC GROUP, HAMAS, OUTLAWED </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON SEPTEMBER 28, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTRY </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE PALESTINIAN (SUNNI) MUSLIM </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATION, HAMAS, HAD BEEN </p><p>OUTLAWED.  ACCORDING TO THE IDF ANNOUNCEMENT, MEMBERS </p><p>OF HAMAS, OR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED OR PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DETENTION AND </p><p>PROSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF HAMAS, SHEIKH AHMED </p><p>YASSIN, HAS BEEN IN ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION FOR A </p><p>NUMBER OF MONTHS.  HAMAS EMERGED AFTER THE OUTBREAK </p><p>OF THE PALESTINIAN UPRISING. ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED FROM </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, ITS AIMS INCLUDE A MUSLIM </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE AND IT PROMOTES VIOLENCE AS A MEANS </p><p>OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE AND OF "PURIFYING" MUSLIM </p><p>SOCIETY.  HAMAS IS STRONGEST IN GAZA BUT ITS </p><p>INFLUENCE HAS SPREAD TO THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO MOSHE DAYAN, DEPUTY TO GOI CIVAD </p><p>COORDINATOR SHMUEL GOREN, AND CIVAD ANALYSTS, HAMAS </p><p>HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY IN STRENGTH IN GAZA IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS.  IT HAS INCREASINGLY TARGETED SO-CALLED </p><p>COLLABORATORS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE IN </p><p>ACTIVITIES DEFINED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS </p><p>ANTI-ISLAMIC.  ACCORDING TO THE IDF, HAMAS IS ALSO </p><p>STRENGTHENING ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND </p><p>REMAINS HARDER TO PENETRATE THAN OTHER PALESTINIAN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  IDF ANALYSTS HAVE ALSO ASSERTED THAT </p><p>HAMAS HAS BECOME A MAJOR INFLUENCE IN GAZA AND, </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS WILLINGNESS TO USE VIOLENCE TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE OTHER PALESTINIANS, MAY HAVE BECOME THE </p><p>DOMINANT FORCE THERE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  EARLIER IN THE UPRISING, SOME ISRAELI </p><p>OCCUPATION OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT HAMAS SERVED AS A </p><p>USEFUL COUNTER TO THE SECULAR ORGANIZATIONS LOYAL TO </p><p>THE PLO.  A NUMBER OF PALESTINIANS LOYAL TO THE PLO </p><p>ALLEGED THAT THE IDF WAS USING HAMAS FOR SUCH A </p><p>PURPOSE.  OUTLAWING THE ORGANIZATION INKCATES THAT </p><p>THE IDF NO LONGER SEES -- IF IT EVER DID -- UTILITY </p><p>IN ALLOWING HAMAS TO OPERATE.  THE ISRAELIS MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN PARTICULARLY TROUBLED OVER THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>PENETRATING THE ORGANIZATION.  AS HAMAS HAS DIRECTED </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST ALLEGED COLLABORATORS, IT IS </p><p>LIKELY THAT THE OCCUPATION AUTHORITIES DECIDED ACTION </p><p>WAS NEEDED TO DISCOURAGE ITS FURTHER GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WHILE A NUMBER OF OUR </p><p>PALESTINIAN INTERLOCUTORS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HAMAS HAS </p><p>GROWN IN STRENGTH, PARTICULARLY IN GAZA, WE DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IT CLAIMS THE ALLEGIANCE OF A LARGE </p><p>SEGMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION.  WE SUSPECT IT </p><p>REMAINS LESS INFLUENTIAL IN THE WEST BANK. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE CHRONIC NATURE OF THE UPRISING </p><p>COUPLED WITH STRINGENT ISRAELI SECURITY MEASURES, </p><p>HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO GREATER VIOLENCE WITHIN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY IN GAZA.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, ISRAELI DETENTION/EXPULSION OF MANY </p><p>PALESTINIAN SECULAR NATIONALISTS HAS LEFT THE STREETS </p><p>OPEN TO YOUNG TOUGHS WHO FIND IT ATTRACTIVE TO CLAIM </p><p>RELIGIOUS, AS WELL AS NATIONALISTIC MOTIVES TO </p><p>JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BROWN </p><p></p></div>
