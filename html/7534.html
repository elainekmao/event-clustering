FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On April 8, Ambassador met with Privatization </p><p>Commission Chairman and former Minister of Public Works, </p><p>Khaliq Fazal.  Fazal,s comments focused on deteriorating </p><p>security conditions around Kandahar, infiltration of </p><p>Pakistanis in the south, political demands on President </p><p>Karzai, and the regrettably stalled work to assess </p><p>Afghanistan,s state-owned enterprises.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Fazal told Ambassador that many Afghans maintained to </p><p>him during his visit to Kandahar the previous week that the </p><p>Taliban were gradually restoring power bases in the south and </p><p>alleged that elements of the local military (governor </p><p>Sherzai,s forces) were &somehow involved.8  Locals were </p><p>unwilling to make their concerns too public out of fear that </p><p>the central government would be unable to protect them. </p><p>Fazal added that Pakistanis were &everywhere8, working as </p><p>engineers and construction labor, and questioned why these </p><p>jobs were not made available to local Afghans.  Fazal told </p><p>Ambassador that he had urged President Karzai upon his return </p><p>to Kabul to reinforce border security and appoint qualified </p><p>leaders to replace the wayward leadership. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Karzai, Fazal claimed, agreed, but did not indicate </p><p>any action he might take.  Fazal said that Karzai needed to </p><p>take strong action to avoid losing popular support.  Fazal </p><p>added that Karzai,s loss of support would also erode popular </p><p>support for the U.S., which was already strained by the war </p><p>in Iraq.  Ambassador agreed that the Afghan people needed to </p><p>see results to maintain the Karzai administration,s </p><p>standing. Ambassador affirmed that the U.S. remained strongly </p><p>behind Afghanistan, noting that both CENTCOM General Franks </p><p>and SE Khalilzad were coming to Kabul to reaffirm this </p><p>commitment later in the week. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fazal turned the conversation to the next year,s </p><p>election, noting that supporters had asked him to form a </p><p>pro-democracy party.  He felt it was too early for this, as </p><p>the elections law was still incomplete, but asked the </p><p>Ambassador his view.  The Ambassador replied that it was not </p><p>necessary to wait for the final election law to be completed </p><p>before forming political parties.  Ambassador added that he </p><p>hoped parties would be formed and that NDI and IRI were </p><p>helping in this regard. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Fazal then noted that resentment was building towards </p><p>expatriate Afghans, like himself, who had returned to </p><p>Afghanistan after long residence abroad.  The Ambassador said </p><p>that while he was impressed by the dedication of those </p><p>Afghans who remained in their country, all Afghans were now </p><p>working to help rebuild their homeland.  Fazal said that the </p><p>resentment towards &carpetbaggers8 was understandable, as </p><p>even the Cabinet had not been paid in ten months.  Fazal </p><p>noted that the expat-Afghans would &be finished if Americans </p><p>leave8 and that the destruction and possible division of </p><p>Afghanistan could follow.  Ambassador expressed his </p><p>conviction that the fundamentalists and others resisting </p><p>political and economic progress in Afghanistan would not </p><p>prevail.  Fazal stressed that building economic capacity was </p><p>critical to this, and that he should hear for himself from </p><p>local Afghan entrepreneurs and traders what the challenges </p><p>were.  Ambassador agreed and a readout of this later meeting </p><p>will be reported septel. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Fazal concluded by reporting that his commission had </p><p>completed their assessment of 85 percent of Afghanistan,s </p><p>176 state-owned enterprises.  Fazal would like to receive </p><p>technical assistance to complete this assessment and act upon </p><p>its findings, but repeated an earlier contention that Finance </p><p>Minister Ghani had told USAID not to assist him in this </p><p>regard.  The Ambassador assured Fazal that USAID did want to </p><p>help and agreed to turn his attention to this matter.  (Note: </p><p>USAID Kabul Economic Governance Program Officer confirmed </p><p>that Ghani has indeed advised them not to proceed with </p><p>privatization technical assistance efforts generally, </p><p>although no specific instructions were given not to work with </p><p>Fazal.  According to USAID Kabul, Ghani,s position may be </p><p>based inter alia on distrust of Fazal and on Ghani,s desire </p><p>to personally control the process.  Endnote.) </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
