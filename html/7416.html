<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 14:  POSITIVE PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS BOOST MARKETS SLIGHTLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Positive statements by IMF and GOT officials over </p><p>the weekend, combined with a lessening of anxiety over Iraq, </p><p>gave Turkish markets a modest lift this morning.  The lira </p><p>strengthened to TL 1,633,000/dollar, yields on the benchmark </p><p>4/28/04 t-bill fell to 62.31 percent, and the stock market </p><p>rose 3.71 percent in morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Investors told us they were heartened by positive </p><p>statements from the IMF and GOT officials, as well as by the </p><p>relatively good news coming out of Iraq (eg. war winding </p><p>down, relative calm in Northern Iraq).  The local press </p><p>quoted IMF European Director Michael Deppler as saying he </p><p>thought the Turkish Government was now fully committed to the </p><p>reform program and that the Letter of Intent the Board would </p><p>consider this week would put Turkey back "on track."  The </p><p>press also reported Treasury Deputy U/S Ozyildiz\'s statement </p><p>in Washington that the GOT would target a 7.7 percent primary </p><p>surplus this year (including 1.2 percent from a partial </p><p>spending freeze), as well as Central Bank Governor </p><p>Serdengecti\'s statement that Turkey could still hit its </p><p>inflation target and produce 3.6 percent growth this year. </p><p>(Note:  Although 3.6 percent growth is lower than the </p><p>official estimate, it is on the high side of the range many </p><p>market analysts now say is likely.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Senior Turkish politicians also weighed in with a </p><p>positive, if less credible, message.  State Minister Babacan </p><p>reportedly told the press that the government had minimized </p><p>the impact of the Iraq war via sound economic measures, while </p><p>Prime Minsiter Erdogan said Turkey would play a major role in </p><p>Iraq\'s reconstruction.  Tourism Minister Aksit declared that </p><p>Turkey expected 15 million tourists to visit this year, </p><p>yielding $13 billion in revenue.  Finance Minister Unakitan </p><p>announced that many foreign investors were interested in </p><p>buying state tobacco and spirits producer Tekel, and that </p><p>Turkey\'s Competition Authority would not object to the sale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The other positive factor in the markets is the </p><p>absence of a significant domestic debt redemption this week </p><p>(only a TL 500 trillion redemption). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
