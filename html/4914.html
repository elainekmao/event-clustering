<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Nigeria\'s Privatization Czar Plans to Bow Out </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nasir El-Rufai, Director-General of the </p><p>Bureau for Public Enterprises, Nigeria\'s agency for the </p><p>privatization of state-owned firms, told the Ambassador and </p><p>DCM on separate occasions that he plans to resign early </p><p>next year and return to the private sector. El-Rufai said </p><p>that President Obasanjo  lack of commitment to economic </p><p>reform was the principal reason. El-Rufai also shared a </p><p>copy of a development plan for the Nigerian economy he </p><p>prepared for Vice-President Abubakar and hinted that he </p><p>might return to government service if a new government were </p><p>serious about economic reform. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In separate conversations with the Ambassador and </p><p>DCM in December, El-Rufai said he had offered his </p><p>resignation to Vice President Atiku Abubakar and intended </p><p>to leave in February 2003.  El-Rufai said Abubakar was </p><p>astonished and asked, "What will you do?"  "Before I came </p><p>to BPE, Sir, I had another life in the private sector, and </p><p>I intend to return to it," El-Rufai told Atiku.  However, </p><p>El-Rufai continued, he was very interested in spending some </p><p>time, perhaps six months, in an academic setting in the </p><p>United States.  Doing so would allow him to re-emerge in </p><p>the private sector more quietly than if he went directly </p><p>from BPE into business. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) El-Rufai said the VP (chair of the National Council </p><p>on Privatization, the policy-making body that oversees BPE) </p><p>had pressed for further information on why he wanted to </p><p>return to the private sector.  El-Rufai responded that </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s commitment to privatization and </p><p>greater transparency had collapsed under the pressures of </p><p>politics.  Trying too hard to please those who could never </p><p>be placated, Obasanjo was sacrificing the precepts of a </p><p>sensible economic agenda in the interest of getting re- </p><p>elected.  Once lost in the current electoral cycle, the </p><p>momentum behind economic reform would not be readily </p><p>restored </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) El-Rufai said he told Abubakar that Nigerian </p><p>leaders, when they finally get around to economic issues, </p><p>become fixated on grandiose development projects and do not </p><p>devote sufficient thought to formulating a sound economic </p><p>vision for the country. He went on to say that, as a result </p><p>of this imbalance, the country now faces its worst fiscal </p><p>crisis since independence. That fiscal crisis, and the </p><p>overall economic malaise of which it is symptomatic, was </p><p>the root cause of recent violence in Kaduna, according to </p><p>El-Rufai. "The riots were not about the Miss World </p><p>Pageant," he said, "They were about economics." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) El-Rufai reports one part of the political </p><p>compromise to keep Abubakar on Obasanjo  ticket as VP for </p><p>the 2003 election was Obasanjo  pledge to let Abubakar run </p><p>the economy during the next term. With that in mind, he </p><p>says Abubakar asked him to prepare a blueprint for </p><p>Nigeria\'s economic growth. El-Rufai said he had told </p><p>Abubakar that a re-elected Obasanjo would be too chastened </p><p>to re-start the process, and any other winner (including </p><p>Abubakar) would likely do no better. Nigerian politicians, </p><p>El-Rufai said, were simply too preoccupied by the politics </p><p>of dividing the pie to think about the policies required to </p><p>make the pie bigger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Nonetheless, he prepared an economic plan for the </p><p>VP, "Breaking the Vicious Circle: An Agenda for the Reform </p><p>of the Nigerian Economy for the Twenty First Century." The </p><p>plan focuses on better management of government resources, </p><p>the need for improved regulation of the economy, and the </p><p>development of human capital -- all with a view toward </p><p>increasing the role of the private sector in the economy. </p><p>(Note: A copy of El-Rufai  plan will be forwarded to AF/W. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In addition, El-Rufai left open the possibility of </p><p>returning to government after a stint in academia, but not </p><p>until well after the upcoming elections, so that he could </p><p>judge from a distance whether commitment to true economic </p><p>reform was present. He was hopeful that Abubakar might </p><p>broker a ministerial position for him if Obasanjo were re- </p><p>elected. However, he emphasized he would only take such a </p><p>position if there were a real opportunity to implement the </p><p>reforms needed to put the Nigerian economy on track. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment: El-Rufai represents the next generation of </p><p>economic leadership in Nigeria. His development plan is the </p><p>best concise articulation of how to fix what is wrong with </p><p>the Nigerian economy. We are hopeful that the next </p><p>President will reward his vision with a ministerial </p><p>position, but due to El-Rufai\'s frankness and relative </p><p>insensitivity to political considerations we think it more </p><p>likely that he will be offered a less-political job. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
