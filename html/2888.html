REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN MEETINGS WITH THE AMBASSADOR APRIL 22 AND 26 </p><p>(REFTEL), CGIL AND UGL LEADERS BOTH REFERRED TO U.S. FORCE </p><p>POLICY THAT EXCLUDES THESE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS FROM </p><p>REPRESENTING DIRECT-HIRE WORKERS AT BASES IN ITALY.  WHILE </p><p>CHARACTERIZING THE UNION\'S RELATIONS WITH THE EMBASSY AS </p><p>"EXCELLENT," OUTGOING CGIL SECRETARY GENERAL SERGIO COFFERATI </p><p>REFERRED TO ONE "MINOR" PROBLEM THAT, HE SAID, HE WAS SURE </p><p>WOULD BE TAKEN UP AND RESOLVED BY HIS SUCCESSOR.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>COFFERATI DIDN\'T IDENTIFY THIS "MINO" PROBLEM (AND PASSED </p><p>OVER IT IN SECONDS), THE RFERENCE TO BASE EXCLUSION WAS </p><p>CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) T THE UGL, DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL RENATA POLVERIN </p><p>ALSO REFERRED TO A "SMALL" PROBLEM AT THE BASES BUT WAS </p><p>DIRECT IN RAISING AND LAYING OUT THE ISUE.  IT WAS ONE, SHE </p><p>SAID, IN WHICH THE UGL (ANDCGIL) HAD BEEN PREVENTED "FOR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL REASON" FROM REPRESENTING DIRECT-HIRE WORKERS. </p><p>THE MATTR HAD BEEN RAISED AND "ALMOST RESOLVED" UNDER THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02216  071435Z </p><p>PREVIOUS AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AND PREVIOUS GOI.

THE CURRENT </p><p>(CENTER-RIGHT) GOI, SHE SUGGESTED, MIGHT INTERVENE FOR </p><p>SIMILAR REASONS ON BEHALF OF BOTH CONFEDERATIONS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR UNDERTOOK TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WHICH, HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED, WAS ONE U.S. MILITARY AUTHORITIES WOULD DECIDE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE ISSUE OF CGIL/UGL EXCLUSION WAS FIRST </p><p>RAISED BY THE CGIL IN 1994, BY THE UGL MORE RECENTLY.  BOTH </p><p>UNIONS HAVE PURSUED THEIR QUEST QUIETLY, THROUGH DIRECT </p><p>REPRESENTATIONS TO U.S. FORCES AND THIS MISSION.  WHILE THE </p><p>UNIONS HAVE DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH THE GOI MINISTRY OF </p><p>LABOR, BOTH HAVE REFRAINED FROM RAISING IT PUBLICLY.  PUBLIC </p><p>DISCLOSURE - WHICH DID NOT RAISE CONTROVERSY AT THE TIME - </p><p>OCCURRED IN JUNE 2000, WHEN COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC) SENATOR </p><p>GIOVANNI RUSSO SPENA FILED A "QUESTION" IN PARLIAMENT SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE ITS ADJOURNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: THE CURRENT CONTEXT IS TRANQUIL. </p><p>SO FAR AS WE KNOW, BASE LABOR RELATIONS ARE GOOD, AND THE </p><p>MISSION\'S RELATIONS WITH ALL FOUR NATIONAL TRADE UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS ARE EXCELLENT.  MILITARY COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>CURRENT GOI IS ONGOING; OUR MILITARY PRESENCE IN ITALY IS </p><p>EXPANDING.  NONETHELESS THE CGIL/UGL ISSUE, "DORMANT" OVER </p><p>THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, HAS AGAIN BEEN RAISED WITH THIS </p><p>MISSION AND COULD AGAIN BECOME AN ISSUE IN PARLIAMENT AND BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02216  071435Z </p><p>RAISED IN THE PRESS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02216 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
