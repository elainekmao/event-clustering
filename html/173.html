<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L NEW DELHI 23722 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y - TEXT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: 9/25/88 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IN, CE, PINS </p><p>SUBJ: INDIAN FRICTION WITH LTTE GROWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: COLOMBO 6523 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. ON SEPTEMBER 24 THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF </p><p>EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ISSUED ANOTHER WARNING TO THE LTTE </p><p>THAT IT WILL RESPOND MORE FORCEFULLY IF THE TAMIL </p><p>MILITANT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT STOP HAMPERING THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD.  THE MEA </p><p>SPOKESMAN BLAMED THE LTTE FOR INSTIGATING AND </p><p>ENGINEERING A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION SEPTEMBER 23 </p><p>BETWEEN SRI LANKAN CIVILIANS AND ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE (IPKF).  THE GROWING THREAT </p><p>OF SUCH CLASHES BETWEEN SRI LANKANS AND INDIAN TROOPS </p><p>APPARENTLY LIES BEHIND THE DECISION TO SEND SEVERAL </p><p>BATTALIONS OF INDIAN POLICE INTO THE NORTHERN AND </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA (REFTEL).  THERE IS </p><p>GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THE LTTE </p><p>CONTINUES ITS PROVOCATIONS, THE INDIAN FORCES SHOULD </p><p>MOVE MORE DECISIVELY AGAINST IT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE MEA SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED THAT A CROWD OF 900 </p><p>TO 1000 PEOPLE--MAINLY LTTE SUPPORTERS WITH WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN IN THE VANGUARD--COLLECTED IN FRONT OF THE </p><p>IPKF CAMP IN MANNAR, OSTENSIBLY WANTING TO PRESENT A </p><p>PETITION TO THE LOCAL INDIAN MILITARY COMMANDER. </p><p>WHILE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE FOR RECEIVING THE </p><p>PETITION, THE LTTE SUPPORTERS REPORTEDLY STARTED </p><p>THROWING STRONES, SHOUTING SLOGANS, AND PUSHING THE </p><p>CROWD INTO THE CAMP.  THE IPKF FIRED FIVE ROUNDS.  TWO </p><p>PERSONS REPORTEDLY WERE WOUNDED BY THE FIRING AND 17 </p><p>INJURED N THE RESULTING STAMPEDE.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>LTTE, ONE OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY DIED.  ACCORDING TO THE MEA SPOKESMAN, </p><p>THE USE OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS A COVER FOR </p><p>THE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WAS "REPREHENSIBLE AND </p><p>COWARDLY."  HE WARNED THEAT INDIAN TROOPS WOULD BE </p><p>"COMPELLED TO RESPOND WITH EVEN STRONGER MEASURES IF </p><p>VIOLENCE IS DELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY THE LTTE." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ACCORDING TO MAJOR INDIAN NEWSPAPERS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 25, BOTH THE INDIAN AND SRI LANKAN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING IPKF-CIVILIAN </p><p>TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND AGREED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF THE INDIAN PARALIMITARY RESERVE POLICE FORCE </p><p>(REFTEL) IS NECESSARY FOR CROWD-CONTROL DUTIES.  "IT </p><p>WAS FELT BY BOTH COUNTRIES THAT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF </p><p>INDIA THE ARMY MUST NOT BE USED REGULARLY TO PREVENT </p><p>ETHNIC OR OTHER RIOTS EXCEPT IN EXTREME EMERGENCIES </p><p>AND FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS.  IT IS ALSO FELT THAT THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE ARMY SOMETIMES ACTS AS AN IRRITANT TO </p><p>GROUPS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN WARFARE FOR QUITE </p><p>SOME TIME. . . .  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRPF UNITS </p><p>WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH TEARGAS SHELLS, RUBBER BULLETS, </p><p>AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER SUCH VIOLENT </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS BY MOBS. . . . THESE FORCES CAN ALSO BE </p><p>USED FOR PATROLLING AREAS FROM WHERE REPORTS OF </p><p>COLONIZATION BY SINHALAS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT.  SUCCESSIVE GOI WARNINGS TO THE LTTE </p><p>HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIGH EMPHASIS IN THE INDIAN MEDIA. </p><p>THERE APPEARS TO BE A GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG INFORMED </p><p>INDIANS--WHICH IS BEGINNING TO BE EXPRESSED IN </p><p>NEWSPAPER COMMENTARIES--THAT THE IPKF MUST MOVE </p><p>DECISIVELY AND FAST TO PREVENT THE INDO-SRI LANKA </p><p>ACCORD FROM GOING "THE WAY OF THE PUNJAB ACCORD." </p><p>THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE GOI WON </p><p>AMONG TAMILS BY ITS AIR-DROP IN JUNE IS BEING ERODED </p><p>BY LTTE PROPOGANDA ALLEGING THAT THE IPKF IS ACTING AS </p><p>AN ALLY OF THE COLOMBO GOVERNMENT.  "THE SITUATION CAN </p><p>BE SAVED AND THE ATMOSPHERE CREATED FOR MODERATE </p><p>LEADERS TO COME INTO THE OPEN," THE TIMES OF INDIA </p><p>STATES, "ONLY IF THE INDIAN TROOPS MOVE QUICKLY AND </p><p>DISARM THE LTTE COMPLETELY." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEAN </p><p></p></div>
