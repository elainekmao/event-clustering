<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE READY TO LEAVE, WITH CONDITIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In an April 16 conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>ZANU-PF spokesman and elder statesman Nathan Shamuyarira </p><p>seemed concerned about the implications of USG actions in </p><p>Iraq for Zimbabwe.  He deemed a U.S. or British invasion </p><p>"unlikely," but thought attempts would be made to destabilize </p><p>the country using the opposition Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC).  Shamuyarira insisted that Robert Mugabe is </p><p>prepared to step down if the MDC withdraws its legal </p><p>challenge of the 2002 presidential election and accepts the </p><p>legitimacy of his presidency.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Is Zimbabwe on post-Iraq list? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an April 16 conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>ZANU-PF spokesman and elder statesman Nathan Shamuyarira </p><p>expressed concern about a recent statement by a Pentagon </p><p>spokesman that dictators around the world should take note of </p><p>the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.  Shamuyarira said there is </p><p>apprehension in some quarters that the United States will not </p><p>stop with Iraq, and he said Zimbabwe has to be concerned it </p><p>might be on the target list.  The Ambassador noted Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s comments of April 15 that the United States had not </p><p>drawn up any list of countries to be invaded.  We do have </p><p>concerns about many developments in Zimbabwe but prefer to </p><p>resolve these through dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Shamuyarira mused that a U.S. or British invasion of </p><p>Zimabwe is unlikely, but he said ZANU-PF expects the British </p><p>government to try to destabilize the country via the </p><p>opposition MDC.  Shamuyarira claimed to have seen evidence of </p><p>a growing willingness on the part of the MDC to use violence. </p><p> He said the opposition party had bombed ZANU-PF offices in </p><p>Chinhoyi, had tried unsuccessfully to blow up a bridge in </p><p>Kadoma during the mid-March stayaway, and had placed spikes </p><p>in the middle of roads to prevent people from getting to </p><p>work.  Shamuyarira thought the MDC had gained confidence in </p><p>their capacity to elicit political change, not because they </p><p>had the support of Zimbabweans but because they were </p><p>acquiring "military capabilities."  ZANU-PF, he said, has the </p><p>capacity to stop these sorts of activities but cautioned that </p><p>this might cause bloodshed.  "Things could get pretty rough </p><p>here," Shamuyarira warned. </p><p> </p><p>Recognize Mugabe\'s legitimacy </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The Ambassador emphasized that violence from any </p><p>quarter would not solve Zimbabwe\'s problems, and he expressed </p><p>his hope that all parties would avoid resorting to it.  The </p><p>solution to Zimbabwe\'s difficulties, Shamuyarira retorted, is </p><p>very simple.  The MDC and the British government must accept </p><p>the outcome of the 2002 presidential election; then the </p><p>ruling party would be prepared to bring the MDC into </p><p>government.  The Ambassador pointed out that the United </p><p>States Government did not consider that election to have been </p><p>free and fair.  A number of organizations had conducted </p><p>extensive observations of the election process and found </p><p>numerous and serious electoral irregularities, including </p><p>widespread violence against opposition supporters, unbalanced </p><p>access to the media, and the provision of voters rolls only </p><p>to the ruling party.  The United States made clear to the GOZ </p><p>prior to the election that a refusal to address and correct </p><p>these problems would have a detrimental impact on our </p><p>bilateral relationship.  The Government of Zimbabwe, however, </p><p>had continued on the same path, and the result was a process </p><p>which could not be considered free and fair. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Shamuyarira dismissed the Ambassador\'s assessment as </p><p>a "subjective, partisan view meant to support the MDC" and </p><p>one "not based on an objective analysis of reality."  The MDC </p><p>won the Harare mayoral election, recent parliamentary </p><p>by-elections in Kuwadzana and Highfield, and 57 parliamentary </p><p>seats in 2000. The ruling party, he insisted, conducts </p><p>elections better than any country on the continent, except </p><p>South Africa.  The bottom line, he said, is that "if people </p><p>don\'t want Mugabe and ZANU-PF, they\'ll say what they want." </p><p>The Ambassador reiterated that the USG had expressed its </p><p>concerns well in advance of the voting days themselves, </p><p>noting that the first phase of our targeted sanctions was </p><p>announced in February 2002, several weeks before the </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p>Way Forward </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The only way forward for Zimbabwe, Shamuyarira </p><p>stressed, was for the MDC to withdraw its legal challenge of </p><p>the election result and acknowledge the legitimacy of the </p><p>Government.  Once they take that step, "we can work with </p><p>them."  The Ambassador asked whether Mugabe would be willing </p><p>to retire before expiration of his term in 2008, and whether </p><p>his early departure would create opportunities for political </p><p>dialogue.  Without hesitation, Shamuyarira said Mugabe is </p><p>willing to leave office but only in a "blaze of glory," not a </p><p>"blaze of condemnation."  He would be prepared to leave if </p><p>the exit were dignified; otherwise, he would stay put.  The </p><p>often-made accusation that Mugabe is clinging to power is </p><p>simply untrue, Shamuyarira claimed.  ZANU-PF, he continued, </p><p>had agreed in 1999 to hold a special party congress in 2000 </p><p>to discuss presidential succession, but other developments </p><p>intervened. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Ambassador asked whether the MDC\'s withdrawal of </p><p>its court challenge and recognition of Mugabe\'s legitimacy </p><p>for a limited period, in exchange for an early retirement by </p><p>the Zimbabean president, could form the basis of a political </p><p>agreement.  Yes, Shamuyarira replied, if the MDC withdraws </p><p>its election challenge and accepts the Government\'s </p><p>legitimacy, Mugabe would be ready to go.  The Ambassador </p><p>welcomed Shamuyarira\'s assurance on that point, stressing </p><p>that an early retirement by Mugabe could help Zimbabwe avoid </p><p>the collision course it appeared to be on.  Shamuyarira said </p><p>Mugabe could not retire under UK condemnation.  The </p><p>Ambassador suggested that Mugabe\'s resignation in order to </p><p>resolve a crisis could be recognized as a "statesmanlike" </p><p>gesture.  We believed that, subsequent to the retirement, the </p><p>legitimacy question would have to be resolved definitively </p><p>through the holding of elections recognized as free and fair </p><p>by both sides, in contrast to the non-transparent elections </p><p>held in 2002.  If there is international recognition that the </p><p>election process was fair and transparent, there would be </p><p>pressure on the losing party to accept the result.  The </p><p>Ambassador added that the United States would accept the </p><p>outcome of an election that conformed to SADC\'s electoral </p><p>norms and standards. </p><p> </p><p>Land </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Shamuyarira freely acknowledged the problems in the </p><p>Government\'s land redistribution program.  Many senior </p><p>figures, including Ministers, had "cashed in" on this </p><p>program, and a high-level "acquisitions committee" headed by </p><p>Vice-President Msika had been formed to clean up the mess. </p><p>The real problem with the land issue, in Shamuyarira\'s view, </p><p>was the strong support given by commercial farmers to the </p><p>MDC.  That support had piqued Mugabe\'s anger and had soured </p><p>relations between the commercial farmers and the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  In his mid-70\'s and a senior member of the ruling </p><p>party politburo, Shamuyarira is Mugabe\'s contemporary and </p><p>enjoys considerable access to the Zimbabwean President.  This </p><p>is the first time we have heard from someone who enjoys such </p><p>a close personal relationship with Mugabe that Mugabe is </p><p>prepared to leave office.  Subsequent to this conversation, </p><p>we learned that Shamuyarira, probably acting at Mugabe\'s </p><p>behest, had earlier sent an emissary to MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s special advisor exploring the possibility of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>dialogue and stressing Mugabe\'s willingness to retire early </p><p>under the right conditions.  The director of the Central </p><p>Intelligence Organization -- Happyton Bonyongwe -- also sent </p><p>an emissary to the MDC on April 16 carrying a similar </p><p>message. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) MDC leaders have previously indicated their </p><p>willingness to withdraw the court challenge in exchange for </p><p>genuine dialogue with the GOZ and real progress toward </p><p>resolving Zimbabwe\'s interlocking crises.  We believe a </p><p>dignified exit is an ironclad precondition for a willing </p><p>departure by Mugabe, although it is unclear what elements </p><p>would comprise such an exit.   At any rate, Shamuyarira\'s </p><p>remarks to us and the two recent overtures to the MDC suggest </p><p>a positive inclination toward dialogue that we ought to </p><p>encourage. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
