SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT BUSH\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE G-8 SUMMIT </p><p>AND THE ANTICIPATED SUMMITS IN SHARM AL SHEIKH AND AQABA AND THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND </p><p>ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ALLEGED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT IS JUST TO TELL ARABS THAT THEY SHOULD </p><p>LEARN A LESSON FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ.  IN "AL ITTIHAD," DR. </p><p>SHAMLAN AL EISSA CRITICIZED THE GULF COUNTRIES ATTITUDE TOWARDS </p><p>U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DISCUSSING BUSH\'S VISIT TO THE REGION, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 6/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... THERE IS CONCERN THAT BUSH\'S VISIT TO SHARM AL SHEIKH AND </p><p>AQABA IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ARAB SURRENDER AS BUSH AND SHARON </p><p>WILL NOT REST WHILE THERE IS STILL RESISTANCE IN THE REGION.  AND </p><p>THE CONCERN INCREASES IN THE SHADOW OF TALKS FOR DEALS THAT WILL </p><p>BE ARRANGED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INTIFADA AND THE BLOOD OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF MARTYRS AND WOUNDED ..." </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON A STATEMENT BY VICE PRESIDENT RICHARD CHENEY ON </p><p>THE WAR ON TERRORISM, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/02: </p><p> </p><p>"...IT SEEMS THAT BUSH\'S "PEACOCK" VISIT (NOTE: MEANING THAT THE </p><p>VISIT IS ONLY FOR APPEARANCES) WILL NOT BE AN EXCEPTION SINCE ITS </p><p>MAIN AIM IS TO TELL ARABS, ALL ARABS, THAT IRAQ WAS ATTACKED AND </p><p>OCCUPIED SO THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN A LESSON, AND WORK WITH HIM </p><p>(BUSH) TO ELIMINATE THE DISOBEDIENT AND RESISTANT COUNTRIES AND </p><p>GROUPS, OR ELSE THEY (ARABS) WILL BE DESTROYED AND CUT INTO </p><p>PIECES IN THE CHENEY WAY." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE CART IN FRONT OF THE HORSE," "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 6/01: </p><p> </p><p>"... THAT EVEN THE BEGINNING ACHIEVES ISRAELI SECURITY, THIS </p><p>MEANS THAT THE ARABS WILL PAY THE PRICE OF PEACE BEFORE THEY GET </p><p>THEIR RIGHTS, AND THAT THE PALESTINIANS WILL BE PAYING A DOUBLE </p><p>PRICE THAT MIGHT DESTROY THEIR EXISTENCE BEFORE THEY REACH THEIR </p><p>PROMISED STATE.  THIS IS WHAT IS FEARED FROM THE UPCOMING BUSH </p><p>VISIT THIS WEEK, SINCE THE CONTINUATION OF PLACING THE CART IN </p><p>FRONT OF THE HORSE MEANS THE CONTINUATION OF A DECEPTION THAT IS </p><p>BASED ON ACHIEVING BOTH OCCUPATION AND SECURITY, WHILE THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ONLY RECEIVES PROMISES." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING THE GULF COUNTRIES ATTITUDE TOWARDS U.S. POLICY </p><p>IN THE REGION, DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON 6/01: </p><p> </p><p>"ALTHOUGH THE STATEMENTS OF GULF OFFICIALS IN THEIR NEWSPAPERS </p><p>AND MEDIA SHOW THEIR HATRED AND DISAGREEMENT TOWARDS THE U.S. </p><p>POLICY IN THE REGION, THE TRUTH REMAINS THAT THE GULF COUNTRIES </p><p>ARE RUNNING IN EVERY WAY THEY CAN TOWARDS THE U.S. IN AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO PLEASE IT IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE (THEMSELVES) A SEAT ON THE </p><p>FAST AMERICAN TRAIN THAT IS CRAWLING THROUGH THE REGION ... WHAT </p><p>THE U.S. WANTS FROM THE GULF COUNTRIES IS AS CLEAR AS THE SUN, TO </p><p>CHANGE AND DETERMINE YOUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, BROADEN PUBLIC </p><p>PARTICIPATION, AND SEEK THE PROTECTION OF CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>IN YOUR COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE OTHERS, OR ELSE THE </p><p>CHANGE IN THE REGION IS DEFINITELY COMING ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AND THE MANY AMERICAN </p><p>"PROMISES" TO IRAQIS, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/31: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT ATTACKING IRAQ AND ITS </p><p>OCCUPYING IS A REFUGE TO EMPHASIZE ITS POWER AND STRENGTH IN </p><p>ORDER TO CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT IT WILL ATTACK WHOEVER </p><p>CHALLENGES IT IN REVENGE FOR THE 9/11 ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND </p><p>WASHINGTON, AND ALSO TO GUARANTEE A SECOND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION FOR GEORGE BUSH.  BUT THE IRAQI PEOPLE WILL NOT </p><p>ALLOW FOR ALL THAT TO HAPPEN AT THEIR EXPENSE, AND WHAT IS </p><p>HAPPENING IN IRAQ NOW IS ONLY THE BEGINNING." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "SHARON IS STILL DREAMING," "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/30: </p><p> </p><p>"... BETS ARE STILL ON REGARDING THE POWER, UNITY, AND SOLIDARITY </p><p>OF THE PALESTINIAN FRONT, AND ALL OF ITS LEADERS KNOW THE DANGERS </p><p>BEHIND THE ISRAELI REQUEST ...  THIS FRONT, THROUGH ITS </p><p>SOLIDARITY AND UNITY, WILL BE ABLE TO BURY THE ZIONIST DREAM AS </p><p>IT DID BEFORE, AND WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS ACHIEVEMENTS IN </p><p>ORDER TO GO ON WITH THE STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN ITS PEOPLE\'S </p><p>LEGITIMATE RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON THE UPCOMING SHARM AL SHEIKH AND AQABA SUMMITS, </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/29: </p><p> </p><p>"... SHARM AL SHEIKH OR AQABA OR ANY OTHER SUMMIT WILL ALWAYS </p><p>SERVE AS TRIALS TO REASSURE (THE U.S. AND ISRAEL) OF THE GOOD </p><p>WILL OF THE ARABS, JUST LIKE ALL PREVIOUS SUMMITS BEFORE THEM, </p><p>AND THEY (THE TWO EXPECTED SUMMITS) WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY </p><p>PRACTICAL REVERBERATION OR REAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE U.S. EXCEPT </p><p>WHEN THE ARABS CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND MAKE OTHERS SENSE THEIR </p><p>SERIOUSNESS AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACT AND NOT ONLY LISTEN." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
