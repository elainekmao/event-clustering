<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  KINSHASA 001961 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: KATUMBA STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 477 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila </p><p>named eminence grise Augustin Katumba Mwanke </p><p>Secretary-General of the DRC\'s transitional government. </p><p>Kabila officially suspended Katumba in October 2002 following </p><p>publication of the UN panel report on illegal exploitation of </p><p>the DRC\'s wealth; however, Katumba\'s influence continued </p><p>unabated.  The role of the Secretary-General is unclear, and </p><p>will doubtless be a subject of debate between ex-rebel </p><p>movements and members of Kabila\'s camp.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Suspension in Name Only </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila named </p><p>Augustin Katumba Mwanke as Secretary-General of the </p><p>transitional government.  Considered a hardliner, Katumba is </p><p>a longtime Kabila associate and former governor of Katanga </p><p>province.  He served as Minister of the Presidency until </p><p>October 2002, when Kabila suspended him and several other </p><p>members of the GDRC\'s ruling elite who were cited in a report </p><p>by the U.N. Panel on Illegal Exploitation of Natural </p><p>Resources and Other Forms of Wealth. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite the suspension, Katumba continued to play a </p><p>major role, exerting influence personally as well as through </p><p>allies such as Guillaume Samba Kaputo, Kabila\'s deputy chief </p><p>of staff.  He was intimately involved with the </p><p>Inter-Congolese Dialogue political negotiations until their </p><p>conclusion in December 2002 and has a hand in the ongoing </p><p>negotiations on military-security integration.  In the months </p><p>leading up to the formation of the DRC\'s transitional </p><p>government, it was rumored that he was bucking to replace </p><p>Jean Mbuyu as Kabila\'s Special Adviser on security matters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What Responsibilities? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4. (C) The transitional constitution is azy on the </p><p>Secretary-General\'s role and responsibilities.  It merely </p><p>says that he "...assists the resident and Vice-Presidents in </p><p>coordinating govrnmental action" by "preparing meetings, </p><p>works ad all dossiers requiring the concerted attention o </p><p>the President and Vice-Presidents and at the cabinet level." </p><p>(Note:  Informal poloff translation. End note.)  According </p><p>to Kabila\'s 25 July decre, four Executive Secretaries will </p><p>assist Katumba one per vice-presidential "commission."  The </p><p>for are: </p><p> </p><p>--Political, Defense and Security Commission - Shadrac </p><p>Baitsura Musowa of the RCD-Goma.  H is a Nande from South </p><p>Kivu, has a background inintelligence work, reportedly an </p><p>associate of Biima Karaha. </p><p> </p><p>--Economic and Financial Commission- Tshimanga Mwadi of the </p><p>MLC.  (Details unknown.) </p><p> </p><p>--Reconstruction and Development Commission - Jlien Bukasa </p><p>Kashama of the Kinshasa government. A Luba from Eastern </p><p>Kasai, former career civil srvant in Ministry of Finance and </p><p>Budget. </p><p> </p><p>--Soial and Cultural Commission - Egide Ngokoso of the </p><p>political opposition.  From Bandundu, a leader inAndre </p><p>Boboliko\'s PDSC political party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reacton to Katumba\'s Return </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) RCD-Goma official Jean-Marie Emungu wa circumspect in </p><p>a 28 July telcon with poloff, sayng only that the RCD-Goma </p><p>had "taken note" of the announcement.  MLC official Thomas </p><p>Luhaka told poloff on 29 July that it is better to have </p><p>Katumba in an official position, where he will face public </p><p>scrutiny.  The Secretary-General\'s role should be strictly </p><p>administrative; however, undoubtedly Katumba and his allies </p><p>will seek to expand it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (C) Having Katumba down amongst the vice-presidents will </p><p>help Kabila maintain his image of being above the fray, and </p><p>at the same time answers the question of where Katumba will </p><p>fit into the new system.  There will likely be a struggle </p><p>over his exact role, with VP\'s Azarias Ruberwa of the </p><p>RCD-Goma and Jean-Pierre Bemba of the MLC seeking to limit </p><p>Katumba\'s powers.  The International Committee to Support the </p><p>Transition (CIAT) may be drawn into the debate, as CIAT </p><p>members will need to decide whether they will want to deal </p><p>with the transitional government through Katumba or interact </p><p>directly with the four vice-presidents.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
