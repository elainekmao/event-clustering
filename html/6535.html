<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000520 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: HUNT OIL SHOOTINGS - MARCH 19 UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 511 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Following the March 18 shooting in Marib of four Hunt </p><p>Oil employees (reftel), our consular section has been in </p><p>touch with the family of deceased Amcit Ron Horsch in the </p><p>U.S. and is assisting in arrangements for shipment of remains </p><p>from Yemen tonight via Frankfurt.  Mark Edwards, the Canadian </p><p>wounded in the shooting, had successful surgery in Sanaa and </p><p>was medevaced from Yemen by air through arrangements made by </p><p>Hunt. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Investigation of the shooting by Naji Ahmed Al-Kumaym </p><p>is continuing.  Embassy team, including FBI local </p><p>representative, an OSI investigator, and RSO staff have </p><p>received information from Yemeni police sources and are </p><p>presently at the Marib site where they will be examining the </p><p>crime scene and interviewing eye witnesses and others in the </p><p>coming hours before returning to Sanaa tonight. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to a Hunt Oil source, Al-Kumaym had been </p><p>released as an employee by Nabors three times since 1992.  He </p><p>is said to have had family problems, not to have been </p><p>religiously observant or extremist, and reportedly was on </p><p>medications, with medications having been found in his room. </p><p>Yemeni police told our investigators that Al-Kumaym had been </p><p>an employee of Nabors for seven years in good standing, as a </p><p>carpenter, and that he was well known by Hunt employees </p><p>including his victims.  The police added that Al-Kumaym had </p><p>seen a doctor three days ago, and had been having sleeping </p><p>problems and problems with his family; the police also said </p><p>Al-Kumaym was not religious and was not known to speak of </p><p>politics.  The police confirmed that the attack weapon was a </p><p>handgun of Russian manufacture, not, as some press reports </p><p>have said, an AK-47. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A Hunt official told us that operations in Yemen are </p><p>under review in the light of regional circumstances, and that </p><p>dependents are to be evacuated.  RSO is providing requested </p><p>advice and assistance in obtaining metal detectors and </p><p>security equipment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Until investigators have interviewed </p><p>witnesses at the site, it remains premature to reach any </p><p>conclusion regarding possible motives behind these shootings. </p><p> We expect to know more by tomorrow. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
