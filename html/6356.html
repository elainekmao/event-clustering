A Vietnamese delegation will visit </p><p>the U.S. in April 2003 and Vietnam will host the annual </p><p>meetings of the APEC Fisheries Working Group and the APEC </p><p>Marine Resources Conservation Working Group the week of June </p><p>9, 2003.  These events will continue to build understanding </p><p>of what Vietnam\'s fisheries sector can expect in the </p><p>international arena, and how U.S. fishery officials can best </p><p>assist Vietnam in sustainable development of its capture </p><p>fisheries and its aquaculture programs.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The 2003 Fisheries Consultations Between Vietnam and the </p><p>United States were held on March 10-13, 2003, in Hanoi, </p><p>Vietnam.  The Vietnamese delegation was led by Dr. Vu Van </p><p>Trieu, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Fisheries (MOFI) </p><p>International Cooperation Department, and the U.S. </p><p>delegation was led by Dr. Rebecca Lent, Deputy Director for </p><p>Regulatory Affairs, U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The meeting between Vietnam and the United States began </p><p>with a courtesy visit with Minister of Fisheries, Dr. Ta </p><p>Quang Ngoc, who warmly welcomed U.S. delegates and stressed </p><p>the importance of the fisheries relationship between Vietnam </p><p>and the United States.  The head of the U.S. delegation </p><p>expressed thanks to the Ministry of Fisheries for hosting </p><p>this meeting and spoke briefly of the similar challenges </p><p>faced by the United States and Vietnam in conserving and </p><p>managing our respective living marine resources. </p><p> </p><p>OPENING REMARKS </p><p> </p><p>4.  Dr. Vu Van Trieu, Deputy Director of the MOFI </p><p>International Cooperation Department welcomed the delegation </p><p>from the United States and noted work by Vietnam to address </p><p>fisheries sector development, including on-going efforts to </p><p>restructure the fisheries sector to promote aquaculture and </p><p>increase deep-water fishing operations.  Dr. Trieu stressed </p><p>the importance of non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and </p><p>International Organization assistance in these efforts.  In </p><p>addition, he noted that increased bilateral and multilateral </p><p>cooperation will bring increased market access, better </p><p>management, and technology transfer to Vietnamese fisheries. </p><p>Finally, Dr. Trieu briefly reviewed the history of the </p><p>fisheries relationship between Vietnam and the United States </p><p>and stressed the value of continued and enhanced fisheries </p><p>cooperation between the two countries. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dr. Lent thanked the Ministry of Fisheries for their </p><p>efforts in organizing and hosting this meeting.  She </p><p>stressed the similar nature of the challenges faced by the </p><p>United States and Vietnam in conserving and managing our </p><p>living marine resources and noted the value of cooperation </p><p>in addressing these common challenges.  Dr. Lent requested </p><p>that Vietnam provide specific ideas for future cooperation </p><p>between our two countries.  Mr. Charles Ehler, Director of </p><p>the International Program Office at the National Ocean </p><p>Service, NOAA, presented a brief description of the </p><p>cooperation already underway between Vietnam and the </p><p>National Ocean Service in the Gulf of Tonkin.  This work </p><p>focuses on capacity building in the Ha Long Bay area to </p><p>promote further development of the marine protected area and </p><p>integrated coastal zone management, including inshore </p><p>fisheries. </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAMESE FISHERIES IN 2002 </p><p> </p><p>6.  Ms. Tran Thi Mieng, Vice Director of the MOFI Planning </p><p>and Investment Department, provided an overview of the </p><p>Vietnamese fisheries.  The first part of this presentation </p><p>related to the current economic situation in Vietnamese </p><p>fisheries, focusing on achievements in resource protection, </p><p>aquaculture, and fisheries export and processing.  The </p><p>second part of the presentation looked at the Vietnamese </p><p>plan for areas of future development until the year 2010. </p><p>It included recommendations for U.S. support in areas </p><p>related to training in fisheries monitoring and safety at </p><p>sea, aquaculture, U.S. import/export laws and regulations, </p><p>and fisheries conservation and management. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Dr. Vu Van Trieu, Deputy Director of the MOFI </p><p>International Cooperation Department, then provided an </p><p>overview of international cooperation relating to the </p><p>fisheries sector.  He noted that Vietnam receives large </p><p>contributions from various sources for fisheries sector work </p><p>and provided detailed lists of past, on-going, and possible </p><p>future donor projects.  Dr. Trieu stressed the importance of </p><p>these funding sources to Vietnam and encouraged the United </p><p>States to provide assistance for new projects. </p><p> </p><p>POTENTIAL AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>8.  Mr. Nguyen Van Chau, Director of the MOFI Fisheries </p><p>Resources Protection Department summarized the current </p><p>situation with regard to Vietnamese fisheries resource </p><p>protection.  This presentation included an overview of </p><p>fisheries resources in Vietnam, information on fishing fleet </p><p>trends, and activities designed to restructure and improve </p><p>the fisheries sector in Vietnam.  It also touched on work </p><p>that Vietnam would like to do concerning fisheries resource </p><p>protection (including integration of management at various </p><p>levels, community-based management, marine protected area </p><p>and endangered species management, and vessel management) </p><p>and enforcement and safety at sea (including vessel </p><p>enforcement and accident/emergency response). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Dr. Nguyen Van Thanh, Deputy Director of the MOFI </p><p>Fisheries Department, provided an overview of some potential </p><p>areas of future fisheries cooperation between the United </p><p>States and Vietnam.  Specifically, Vietnam would like work </p><p>on aquaculture (including environmental protection in </p><p>aquaculture, seed production technology, farming technology, </p><p>and human resources training). </p><p> </p><p>10.  The US Delegation responded to these proposals by </p><p>noting that the Vietnamese presentations were informative </p><p>and helpful in understanding the specific areas of possible </p><p>cooperation between the two countries.  Given the difficult </p><p>budget situation in U.S. federal agencies, there will be a </p><p>need to be creative in selecting activities that build upon </p><p>existing programs.  Dr. Lent noted that in addition to the </p><p>National Marine Fisheries Service, The National Oceanic and </p><p>Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) includes the National </p><p>Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA Research and the National Weather </p><p>Service (NWS).  NOS has a number of cooperative activities </p><p>with Vietnam (see discussion below).  NOAA Research includes </p><p>the Sea Grant Program, which is not only involved in </p><p>aquaculture research, but also provides for training through </p><p>the Sea Grant student-funding program.  The National Weather </p><p>Service is working with its counterpart in Vietnam on flood </p><p>forecasts, and Dr. Lent indicated that NOAA Fisheries would </p><p>make contact with their counterparts at NWS upon their </p><p>return. </p><p> </p><p>11.  In the spirit of working within current programs to the </p><p>maximum extent possible, Dr. Lent suggested that the various </p><p>NOAA Fisheries programs might be able to host visitors from </p><p>Vietnam for 2 to 3 month internships.  These visits could be </p><p>in science centers, regional offices, or at headquarters, </p><p>and cover science, management, enforcement, and other </p><p>topics.  It was noted that these visits would need to be </p><p>funded by Vietnam, for travel and lodging expenses.  The </p><p>National Marine Fisheries Service can assist with </p><p>identifying options for local lodging. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Dr. Lent also noted that the types of aquaculture </p><p>research and technical assistance contained in the </p><p>cooperation proposals might be more appropriate for the </p><p>academic community.  Through the Sea Grant program and other </p><p>avenues, NMFS may be able to assist their colleagues from </p><p>Vietnam in making contact with appropriate university staff. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Dr. Loh-Lee Low described the Fisheries Science Centers </p><p>of National Marine Fisheries Service that have research </p><p>programs that could offer cooperative opportunities for </p><p>Vietnamese scientists. The mission of the Science Centers is </p><p>to conduct scientific research programs to generate the best </p><p>scientific information for understanding and conserving the </p><p>Nation\'s living marine resources and the environmental </p><p>quality essential for their existence.  The Science Centers </p><p>cover a wide geographical range and diversity of species </p><p>that are bound to cover the scientific interests of </p><p>Vietnamese scientists. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Centers conduct research on the economically </p><p>important resources and their interactions with ecologically </p><p>related species and their ecosystems. The Centers conduct </p><p>resource surveys and analyze the data with commercial </p><p>fisheries data collected through programs such as the </p><p>Fisheries Observer Programs. The Observer programs place </p><p>biologists to collect scientific data from fishing vessels </p><p>and processing plants.  These survey and data gathering </p><p>programs offer opportunities to train Vietnamese scientists </p><p>on the finer techniques of collecting data for stock </p><p>assessments. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The Centers analyze data to determine the population </p><p>dynamics and status of the stocks and evaluate impacts of </p><p>fishing and effects of environmental change on the resources </p><p>and their ecosystems.  The Centers also have social </p><p>scientists and economists who evaluate impacts of </p><p>alternative fishing strategies on the fishing communities. </p><p>These programs can further offer training opportunities for </p><p>Vietnamese scientists.  While there are many opportunities </p><p>for cooperative programs between our Fisheries Science </p><p>Centers with Vietnam, there are no identifiable financial </p><p>resources that have been set aside to execute such programs. </p><p>However, there may be opportunities for case-by-case </p><p>cooperation when the research interests of some of our </p><p>programs match those of Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Mr. Charles Ehler, who serves as the Vice-Chair of the </p><p>World Conservation Union\'s (acronym is IUCN) World </p><p>Commission on Protected Areas, outlined the responsibilities </p><p>of the National Ocean Service, particularly in the areas of </p><p>coastal management and marine protected management.  He </p><p>pointed out that habitat management is the common link </p><p>between coastal, marine protected area, and fisheries </p><p>management.  He then described progress on an existing two- </p><p>year (2002-2004) NOAA project with the Ministry of </p><p>Fisheries, Institute of Fisheries Economics and Planning </p><p>(Dr. Nguyen Chu Hoi), and IUCN-Vietnam to build capacity for </p><p>integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Gulf of Tonkin, </p><p>with a focus on Ha Long Bay.  Hal Long Bay is one of only </p><p>twelve Marine World Heritage Sites in the world.  It lies </p><p>within a region that will develop significantly over the </p><p>next 10 years.  The project will sponsor a socio-economic </p><p>assessment workshop in Ha Long Bay from 18-20 March, a </p><p>workshop on integrated coastal management in April, and a </p><p>mid-term project evaluation meeting in the United States in </p><p>October.  Mr. Ehler also noted coastal management training </p><p>opportunities for Vietnamese participants in Coastal Zone </p><p>\'03, an international conference in Baltimore, Maryland, </p><p>from 13-17 July, and IUCN\'s World Parks Congress, an </p><p>important meeting of the world\'s protected area managers and </p><p>scientists, that will be held in Durban, South Africa from 8- </p><p>17 September, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>17.  While the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) was unable to attend </p><p>this meeting, they have expressed a willingness to cooperate </p><p>where possible to address Vietnamese training interests </p><p>relating to fisheries enforcement and safety at sea.  The </p><p>U.S. delegation provided a number of paper and CDROM copies </p><p>of the USCG International Training Management Handbook and </p><p>one possible training pipeline scenario that might be useful </p><p>to Vietnam in its training decisions.  The complete catalog </p><p>is also available at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g- </p><p>ci/affairs/handbook/index.htm. </p><p> </p><p>18.  While the USCG provides at-sea enforcement in U.S. </p><p>fisheries, the National Marine Fisheries Service Office of </p><p>Law Enforcement is charged with dockside inspections and </p><p>investigation of possible fisheries regulation/law </p><p>infractions.  The U.S. delegation encouraged the Vietnamese </p><p>to consult the provided information and develop specific </p><p>training interests for the future.  It was agreed that the </p><p>U.S. would consult with the Vietnamese MOFI point of contact </p><p>and appropriate USCG and NMFS enforcement personnel to begin </p><p>examining possible future training opportunities and discuss </p><p>funding options. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The U.S. delegation also encouraged Vietnam to join the </p><p>International Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) </p><p>Network and committed to providing further information on </p><p>this important enforcement organization.  This is a no-cost </p><p>option for increasing enforcement capability in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Discussing assistance to Vietnamese personnel on U.S. </p><p>export-import laws, regulations and procedures, the U.S. and </p><p>Vietnam reaffirmed the importance of maintaining a </p><p>relationship based on free and fair trade.  Vietnam </p><p>expressed its desire to join the World Trade Organization </p><p>(WTO) as soon as possible.  The United States welcomed this </p><p>news and noted that Vietnam\'s engagement in a range of </p><p>multilateral and regional fora, such as APEC and the FAO, </p><p>was exactly the right approach to inform its policies and </p><p>gain influence in the world arena.  The U.S. offered to </p><p>assist Vietnam in acceding to the WTO. </p><p> </p><p>21.  The United States highlighted the rapid increase in </p><p>imports of fisheries products from Vietnam as an example of </p><p>expanding commercial relations between the two countries. </p><p>Both the United States and Vietnam acknowledged that recent </p><p>trade frictions were business-to-business matters and do not </p><p>reflect policy differences on trade relations between Hanoi </p><p>and Washington, D.C. </p><p> </p><p>22.  The U.S. trade regime was characterized as open and </p><p>transparent.  The United States agreed to help Vietnam </p><p>better understand its trade system where possible, including </p><p>through bilateral exchanges of information such as these </p><p>talks provide.  The United States considered it worth noting </p><p>that the U.S. administration, including the Executive Branch </p><p>Agencies of the Department of Commerce and the U.S. </p><p>International Trade Commission are compelled to go forward </p><p>with a trade case once it is initiated and, therefore, the </p><p>Administration has no discretion to halt the process. </p><p>Vietnam expressed their desire that this case be addressed </p><p>in a fair and accurate manner. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Both sides shared their experiences and views regarding </p><p>the interruption of imports caused by issues related to </p><p>antibiotic residues.  Vietnam expressed its interest in </p><p>receiving training in the area of food safety and sanitary </p><p>and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Finally, it was pointed out that the Vietnam Embassy </p><p>and Consulates in the United States can help Vietnam with </p><p>its exports to the United States.  At the same time, the </p><p>U.S. Embassy in Hanoi can assist with imports from the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. PROPOSALS/REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>25.  The U.S. encouraged Vietnam to accede to the UN </p><p>Agreement on Fish Stocks and the Food and Agriculture </p><p>Organization (FAO) Compliance Agreement, and to implement </p><p>the FAO International Plans of Action (IPOAs) and the Code </p><p>of Conduct.  The U.S. provided website addresses for copies </p><p>of their NPOAs on sharks, seabirds, capacity and illegal, </p><p>unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU).  Vietnam </p><p>indicated that they were fully aware of the FAO plans of </p><p>action and were implementing these through their various </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Regarding the Status and Trends issue at FAO, there was </p><p>discussion of how Vietnam can get some assistance in </p><p>improving the quality and quantity of their reporting on </p><p>fisheries.  These efforts will improve the quality of stock </p><p>assessments, which are so critical to improved fishery </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p>27.  The group reviewed the outcome of the COFI meeting </p><p>discussion regarding FAO-CITES cooperation.  Three documents </p><p>from the meeting were noted:  1) Workplan - completed at </p><p>COFI; 2) The establishment of the advisory body - completed </p><p>at COFI; 3) The MOU - will require further work. </p><p> </p><p>28.  Vietnam noted that they have a sea turtle project </p><p>underway with the assistance of WWF, IUCN, and TRAFFIC. </p><p>Vietnam has a number of protected areas that are nesting </p><p>beaches for these sea turtles.  In 1997, Vietnam and other </p><p>ASEAN members signed an MOU on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation </p><p>and Protection.  In 2001 Vietnam also signed an MOU on the </p><p>Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their </p><p>Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia.  Vietnam </p><p>is also developing an NPOA for sea turtles.  Dr. Lent </p><p>expressed appreciation for the activities underway in </p><p>Vietnam regarding sea turtle conservation.  She noted that </p><p>in the United States, a number of fisheries have been </p><p>subjected to severe restrictions, including closures, </p><p>because of sea turtle by-catch.  In many cases, some of the </p><p>species (particularly leatherback and loggerheads) have </p><p>nesting beaches in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>29.  The APEC Fisheries Working Group has completed several </p><p>projects that could be useful to address aquaculture </p><p>problems raised by Vietnam.  For example, the 1999 Import </p><p>Risk Assessment project explains detailed procedures that </p><p>can be used to prevent the spread of shrimp virus through </p><p>imported seed, or larvae. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Work is just beginning on a new project, approved at </p><p>the FWG meeting in Lima last year that will look at two </p><p>important studies that should be completed before an </p><p>aquaculture project is started.  One evaluation should look </p><p>at environmental sustainability of an aquaculture project. </p><p>The other evaluation should consider economic </p><p>sustainability.  Economic sustainability can be determined </p><p>by an analysis of domestic and international market demands </p><p>for the planned aquaculture model.  For example, a project </p><p>for salmon aquaculture is probably not a good idea, because </p><p>too many companies are already producing salmon and the </p><p>prices are low. </p><p> </p><p>31.  June 2003, Vietnam will be hosting a joint </p><p>meeting of the APEC Fisheries Working Group and the Marine </p><p>Resources Conservation Working Group.  The two sides </p><p>discussed preparations for these working group meetings and </p><p>for an industry roundtable to be held in conjunction with </p><p>these meetings. </p><p> </p><p>32.  COMMENT: Following the talks, the USDel traveled with </p><p>MOFI staff to visit Provincial officials at Ha Long Bay, in </p><p>Quang Ninh Province.  In talks with People\'s Committee </p><p>officials and with Provincial fisheries officials, the </p><p>delegation learned more about the Province\'s plans for the </p><p>future and the problems it faced in implementing them.  A </p><p>boat visit to Ha Long Bay itself, a World Heritage site, </p><p>gave the delegation insights into marine environment user </p><p>conflicts that face the Bay.  The delegation also visited </p><p>Hai Phong City.  There they visited with the Research </p><p>Institute of Marine Fisheries and its fisheries research </p><p>vessel.  The final stop was a visit to the Ha Long Fisheries </p><p>Corporation.  This State-owned enterprise appears to be </p><p>facing severe economic difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>33.
