<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The standoff with Iraq remains fodder for opinion </p><p>      articles being carried in the mainstream newspapers. </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Imminent war against Iraq: The ironies </p><p>      and contradictions" the pro-government weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mirror" (03/09) dedicated its ghost column "The Scrutator" </p><p>      to warning that "the conflict over Iraq will spill over the </p><p>      entire Middle East and constitute a conflagration so </p><p>      frightening as to distort the current balance of forces in </p><p>      the world, with both unforeseen and immeasurable </p><p>      consequences for humanity."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "The ironies and contradictions attendant to the </p><p>      current campaign for war against Iraq are becoming </p><p>      increasingly compelling.  Even before the U. S. and </p><p>      Britain declare formal hostilities against Iraq, the </p><p>      leaders of the two countries are finding it </p><p>      difficult to deal with a public opinion, at home and </p><p>      abroad, which is blowing holes in the argument that </p><p>      Iraq is a threat to peace.  Therefore, one of the </p><p>      glaring ironies is that the U. S. A. and Britain are </p><p>      now being projected as the real war-mongers, </p><p>      determined to defy public opinion that has grown so </p><p>      loud in its anti-war campaign throughout the western </p><p>      world and beyond, and ignoring the obvious </p><p>      devastation that war will bring to both the people </p><p>      of Iraq and the Middle East as a whole. </p><p>      Accordingly, gaining currency is the conclusion that </p><p>      the underlying motivation for war against Iraq on </p><p>      the part of the U. S. A. and Britain is oil and </p><p>      Israel. . .In the final analysis, the Iraq question </p><p>      will see many other political casualties in the </p><p>      western hemisphere, including the leadership in such </p><p>      countries as Spain and Italy.  It will provoke and </p><p>      exacerbate internal conflicts in a number of </p><p>      countries in the Islamic world; not least those </p><p>      viewed to be close to the U. S. A., namely, Egypt, </p><p>      Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  As I have already </p><p>      stated, the conflict over Iraq will spill over the </p><p>      entire Middle East and constitute a conflagration so </p><p>      frightening as to distort the current balance of </p><p>      forces in the world, with both unforeseen and </p><p>      immeasurable consequences for humanity.  Quite </p><p>      characteristic of imperialism per se, there is the </p><p>      usual overestimation of one\'s power and a </p><p>      corresponding underestimation of unforeseen </p><p>      consequences.  Bush\'s U. S. A. may have bitten more </p><p>      than it can chew." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "U. S. unilateralism cause of </p><p>      terrorism" the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mail" (03/09) carried an opinion piece by Tafataona Mahoso </p><p>      under his weekly column "African Focus," in which he </p><p>      accused the United States and Britain for "white-mailing </p><p>      the world by claiming that their threatened unilateral and </p><p>      illegal war on Iraq is the best way to fight terrorism." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The global dominance of the media of the North </p><p>      Atlantic states, combined with the African </p><p>      preoccupation with Western ties, made Africans </p><p>      forget that Russia had suffered horrific acts to </p><p>      terrorism long before the September 11 attack on New </p><p>      York, Washington and Pentagon.  In fact, the people </p><p>      and movement accused of perpetrating the September </p><p>      11 attacks in the U. S. had been groomed as an anti- </p><p>      communist force against Russia and the former Soviet </p><p>      Union by the very same United States which on </p><p>      September 11, 2001 allegedly fell victim to its own </p><p>      supposed `freedom fighters\' against communism. . </p><p>      .From the point of view of the Russian Federation . </p><p>      . .unilateralism is, in fact, one of the biggest </p><p>      causes of international terrorism. . .The worst </p><p>      example of this tendency is the U. S.-U. K. position </p><p>      on Iraq.  These two countries are white-mailing the </p><p>      world by claiming that their threatened unilateral </p><p>      and illegal war on Iraq is the best way to fight </p><p>      terrorism.  They are also claiming that they have </p><p>      proof that Al-Qaeda has relations with Iraq.  This </p><p>      claim is a lie and it has the effect of actually </p><p>      taking the rest of the world away from dealing with </p><p>      real terrorism and its causes. . .The horrors of </p><p>      September 11 did succeed in shifting the Western </p><p>      view and appreciation of terrorism, but any gains </p><p>      made since then in seeking a collective global </p><p>      position on the problem were going to be destroyed </p><p>      if the U. S. and UK succeeded in using the cover of </p><p>      combating terrorism to justify a genocidal war </p><p>      against Iraq. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "U. S. not providing enough resources </p><p>      to schools" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (03/10) carried the following op-ed by Bob Herbert in which </p><p>      he attacked the United States of wanting "to spend hundreds </p><p>      of billions of dollars on the war against Iraq" at the </p><p>      expense of the provision of adequate resources for children </p><p>      in public schools in the United States.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "Here\'s something surreal about the fact that the </p><p>      United States of America - the richest, most </p><p>      powerful nation in history - can\'t provide a basic </p><p>      public school education for all its children. </p><p>      Actually, that\'s wrong.  Strike the word `can\'t.\' </p><p>      The correct word is more damning, more reflective of </p><p>      the motives of the people in power.  The correct </p><p>      word is `won\'t.\'  Without giving the costs much </p><p>      thought, we\'ll spend hundreds of billions of dollars </p><p>      on an oil-powered misadventure in the Middle East. </p><p>      But we won\'t scrape together the money for </p><p>      sufficient textbooks and teachers, or even, in some </p><p>      cases, to keep the doors open at public schools in </p><p>      struggling districts from Boston on the East Coast </p><p>      to Portland on the West. . .It\'s everyone\'s </p><p>      obligation to educate the next generation of </p><p>      Americans.  It\'s an insane society that can </p><p>      contemplate devastating and then rebuilding Iraq, </p><p>      but can\'t bring itself to provide schooling for all </p><p>      of its young people here at home." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
