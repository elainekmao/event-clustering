<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON), Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PM RESIGNS; NEW GOVERNMENT,PROBABLY WITH </p><p>SOME OLD FACES, TO BE FORMED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0961 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0978 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand resigned from </p><p>office on May 30.  Well-placed Palace sources predict the </p><p>Palace will approach leaders of the Parliamentary parties to </p><p>form an all-party government.  A confidant of the King </p><p>credits US (and, we believe, Indian) pressure with </p><p>encouraging the King to compromise.  Palace sources are </p><p>suggesting former Panchayat Prime Minister and head of the </p><p>National Democratic Party Surya Bahadur Thapa as the parties\' </p><p>consensus candidate for Prime Minister.  Whether the parties </p><p>will accept this initiative, if it is indeed offered, depends </p><p>on several factors, including whether all can agree on the </p><p>aging, four-time former Prime Minister to head an all-party </p><p>Cabinet.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>KING TAPPING THAPA? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Royal confidant Prabhakar Rana told Charge on May 29 </p><p>that he had been instructed by King Gyanendra to inform him </p><p>that Prime Minster Lokendra Bahadur Chand would step down the </p><p>following day and that the King would invite leaders of the </p><p>Parliamentary parties to form a new all-party interim </p><p>government.  Rana predicted that the parties will choose </p><p>former leader of the rightist National Democratic Party </p><p>(known by its Nepali acronym as RPP) and four-time former </p><p>Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa as the consensus nominee </p><p>to head the new government.  Thapa will be more acceptable to </p><p>the parties than Chand (another former RPP leader and </p><p>Panchayat Prime Minister), Rana said confidently, because he </p><p>is perceived as being more supportive of democracy and has a </p><p>reputation as a savvy politician, able to build consensus and </p><p>take decisions.  (Note:  This is the second time we have </p><p>heard this prospective scenario from Rana.  The first </p><p>time--in mid-April--events did not unfold as described.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Rana said the King had been influenced to act </p><p>because of USG concerns, conveyed by Charge in a May 28 </p><p>meeting with Rana, that the Palace was missing an opportunity </p><p>to bring the parties together for the good of the nation. </p><p>(Comment:  Indian pressure on the King may have proved even </p><p>more decisive.  See Para 4 below.  End comment.)  For the </p><p>initiative to work, however, the Palace is relying on the </p><p>Embassy to help persuade the parties to cooperate, Rana said. </p><p> Should the parties fail to take advantage of this opening, </p><p>the King will be forced "to take other action," Rana </p><p>cautioned.  The Charge asked what effect a change in Cabinet </p><p>might have on ongoing dialogue with Maoist insurgents, since </p><p>all the members of the Government negotiating team are also </p><p>Cabinet members.  Rana related that since the Maoists had </p><p>expressed discontent with the head of the Government team, </p><p>Information Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, and that some </p><p>reportedly were even complaining about dialogue coordinator </p><p>and Physical Planning Minister Narayan Singh Pun, perhaps a </p><p>change would be good.  (Comment:  We\'re willing to believe </p><p>the Maoists want to get rid of Pandey; the comments about Pun </p><p>seem less credible.  In our view, retaining Pun, who first </p><p>established dialogue with the Maoists, would help maintain </p><p>continuity and confidence in the talks.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Later the same evening Charge was contacted at home </p><p>by Geeta Joshi, an advisor to PM Chand, who confirmed that </p><p>Chand would step down.  Joshi said the move was prompted by </p><p>the "tremendous pressure" the Indians had brought to bear on </p><p>the King to compromise with the political parties. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On May 30 Prime Minister Chand announced his </p><p>resignation.  According to the state-owned news agency, the </p><p>rest of his Cabinet will continue until a new government can </p><p>be formed.  According to police sources, by mid-afternoon the </p><p>King had invited members of the parliamentary parties to the </p><p>long-deferred "tea party" to discuss formation of a new </p><p>Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  A high-ranking member of the National Security </p><p>Council told us on May 30 that the King plans to invite first </p><p>all former Prime Ministers to a discussion, to be followed by </p><p>members of the Parliamentary parties.  Besides Thapa, he </p><p>suggested former Speaker of Parliament Taranath Ranabhat as a </p><p>possible consensus candidate.  Madhav Nepal, the head of the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), </p><p>currently the largest party in the country, is no longer in </p><p>the running, he indicated. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES ARE WEIGHING OPTIONS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Even before the PM\'s announcement, on May 30 the </p><p>local press was reporting the rumor that Chand would step </p><p>down and be replaced by Thapa.  Jhala Nath Khanal, a Central </p><p>Committee member of the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML) told us that Thapa had been informally </p><p>proposed to the UML as a consensus candidate by current RPP </p><p>President Pashupati S.J.B. Rana.  The UML would obviously </p><p>prefer that someone from one of the two largest parties--the </p><p>UML or the Nepali Congress--be tapped, but the UML respects </p><p>Thapa\'s pro-democracy stance and would not reject his </p><p>candidacy out of hand, Khanal said. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Khanal\'s comparatively conciliatory tone contrasts </p><p>sharply with recent hard-line rhetoric emanating from the </p><p>parties, especially since their May 28-29 "reconvening" of </p><p>the dissolved Parliament at the Royal Nepal Academy (Ref B). </p><p>Some former MPs at the May 29 sit-in--including some from the </p><p>UML--reportedly called for the establishment of a republic if </p><p>the King continues his "activism."  The meeting, which was </p><p>chaired by Nepali Congress President and former Prime </p><p>Minister G.P. Koirala, adopted a six-point statement, </p><p>featuring a proposal that the Chand government be replaced by </p><p>either an all-party government or by reinstatement of the </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES\' PROBABLE REACTION: </p><p>A LOT DEPENDS ON PACKAGING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  Comment: Whether or not the parties will accept this </p><p>initiative depends, to a large degree, on how it is presented </p><p>to them.  Chand was, by all accounts, the parties\' consensus </p><p>candidate for interim Prime Minister in October.  Only after </p><p>the King appointed all the rest of the Cabinet as well (a </p><p>move which royal confidant Rana now acknowledges as a </p><p>misstep) did the parties begin to complain that the </p><p>government was "unconstitutional."  However much the UML and </p><p>the Nepali Congress might wish it, the King is unlikely to </p><p>accept the head of either party as PM.  There is too much bad </p><p>blood by now between Koirala (who had apparently threatened </p><p>to accuse the King publicly of involvement in the royal </p><p>massacre) and the King, while both the Indians and the </p><p>Maoists harbor strong objections (albeit for different </p><p>reasons) to the nomination of UML General Secretary Madhav </p><p>Nepal.  As a former leader of the pro-Palace RPP and a former </p><p>Prime Minister during the autocratic Panchayat regime, Surya </p><p>Bahadur Thapa is obviously more preferable--and can be </p><p>expected to be more sympathetic--to the King.  His </p><p>pro-democracy credentials, on the other hand, could make him </p><p>more palatable to the parties, who could see him as less </p><p>easily manipulated by the Palace than long-time rival Chand. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  Comment continued:  The King\'s reported intention </p><p>to seek a consensus PM and form a consensus Cabinet is indeed </p><p>welcome news.  But since the parties already feel, whether </p><p>justifiably or not, that they were hoodwinked by the Palace </p><p>the last time into agreeing to Chand with the understanding </p><p>that other portfolios in the Cabinet would be equitably doled </p><p>out--only to have the King appoint the rest of the Cabinet as </p><p>well--the parties may be doubly cautious and suspicious this </p><p>time.  If the parties perceive that Thapa is being forced </p><p>upon them, they may become recalcitrant--thereby possibly </p><p>incurring the "other action" by the King that Rana hinted at. </p><p> If the "tea party" initiative fails to result in the desired </p><p>consensus, the King may harden his stance against the </p><p>parties, and mutual suspicion will increase.  We will </p><p>continue to encourage both the parties and our Palace </p><p>interlocutors to work together to form a government that more </p><p>closely reflects Nepal\'s multi-party landscape. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
