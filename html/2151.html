<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 003267 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/UBI, SA/PAB, SA/SEAR, IO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/07/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, EAID, EUN, NL, JA </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE - DUTCH QUESTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 192153 </p><p>     B. TOKYO 7585 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLCOUNS MARY E. DALY, REASONS 1.5 B/D </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE, CHARGE HAS SCHEDULED AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT WITH DUTCH DEPUTY POLITICAL SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>HERMAN SCHAPER ON NOVEMBER 8 TO DISCUSS AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE </p><p>AND HE WOULD APPRECIATE TALKING POINTS TO ADDRESS DUTCH </p><p>QUESTIONS IN PARA 2 BELOW BY COB WASHINGTON TIME ON NOVEMBER </p><p>7. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING MEETINGS ON NOVEMBER 5 TO DISCUSS REF A TALKING </p><p>POINTS ON AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE, SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE DUTCH </p><p>MFA\'S SOUTH ASIA DEPARTMENT WERE LOOKING FOR A DUTCH ROLE IN </p><p>THE POLITICAL AND RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS, AS WELL AS MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ON U.S. VIEWS.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE ON </p><p>THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS </p><p>OF THE CHARGE\'S MEETING NOVEMBER 7: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE DUTCH BELIEVE THAT THE AFGHAN SUPPORT GROUP SHOULD BE </p><p>THE FOCAL POINT FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND ASSISTANCE, RATHER </p><p>THAN ANY NEW ORGANIZATION.  THEIR QUESTIONS:  DOES THE U.S. </p><p>AGREE?  IS THE JAPAN-HOSTED EVENT AT UNGA BEING DONE IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE AFGHAN SUPPORT GROUP?  IF NOT, WHAT ROLE DOES </p><p>THE U.S. SEE FOR THE AFGHAN SUPPORT GROUP AND HOW WILL WE </p><p>ENSURE EFFICIENT USE OF AID? </p><p> </p><p>-- THE DUTCH ASKED FOR U.S. VIEWS ON SRSG BRAHIMI\'S PROPOSAL </p><p>TO HOST A MEETING ON AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE IN MECCA, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA.  THE MFA\'S INITIAL, UNOFFICIAL REACTION IS THAT IT </p><p>WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA BECAUSE IT COULD LEND AN "ISLAMIST" </p><p>MANTLE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION.  WHAT ARE U.S. VIEWS? </p><p> </p><p>-- WITH REGARD TO THE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A POST-TALIBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, THE DUTCH INDICATED THAT THERE HAD TO BE A ROLE </p><p>FOR THE COUNTRIES THAT WOULD END UP FOOTING THE BILL.  ONE </p><p>IDEA, NOT YET OFFICIAL DUTCH POLICY, IS TO PRESS THE U.S. TO </p><p>EXPAND THE 6-PLUS-2 MECHANISM TO INCLUDE ENTITITES SUCH AS </p><p>THE EU AND INDIA.  THEY SAID THEY HAD NOT/NOT TALKED ABOUT </p><p>THIS YET WITH OTHER EU COUNTRIES.  PLEASE ADVISE ON WHAT WE </p><p>CAN SAY TO THE DUTCH ABOUT THE ROLE THEY COULD PLAY IN THE </p><p>EFFORT TO DEVELOP A POST-TALIBAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
