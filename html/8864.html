<p>UNCLAS ROME 002799 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY:  NO FUTURE COURT APPEARANCES FOR PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 2529 </p><p>     B. ROME 2284 </p><p> </p><p>    (U)  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  LEGISLATION TO SUSPEND TRIALS AGAINST </p><p>ITALY\'S FIVE HIGHEST OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>DURING THEIR TERMS OF OFFICE, IS VIRTUALLY LAW.  WE PREDICT A </p><p>TRIAL-FREE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY AND REMAINING TENURE FOR </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON JUNE 18 PASSED </p><p>LEGISLATION SUSPENDING TRIALS AGAINST ITALY\'S FIVE HIGHEST </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL FIGURES (PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC, SENATE, </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER) DURING THEIR TERMS IN OFFICE BY A VOTE OF 302 IN </p><p>FAVOR, 17 AGAINST, WITH 13 ABSTENTIONS.  (MOST OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WALKED OUT OF THE CHAMBER.)  CENTER-LEFT DAISY </p><p>PARTY DEPUTY ANTONIO MACCANICO, WHO FIRST INTRODUCED </p><p>LEGISLATION TO SHIELD THE FIVE OFFICIALS, AND GREENS DEPUTY </p><p>MARCO BOATO, WHOSE DRAFT TO EXPAND PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY WAS </p><p>USED BY THE MAJORITY AS THE BASIS FOR THE LEGISLATION, JOINED </p><p>THE CENTRIST UNION OF DEMOCRATS FOR EUROPE (UDEUR) AND </p><p>ITALIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS (SDI) IN ABSTAINING.  THE </p><p>SENATE PASSED THE SAME LEGISLATION ON JUNE 5 (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE LEGISLATION MUST STILL BE SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE REPUBLIC CIAMPI AND PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE </p><p>BEFORE TAKING EFFECT.  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, CIAMPI HAS 30 </p><p>DAYS TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION OR RETURN IT TO PARLIAMENT, BUT </p><p>HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN IT WITHIN THE WEEK.  IT WOULD NORMALLY </p><p>BE PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING DAY; A LAW TAKES EFFECT THE DAY </p><p>AFTER PUBLICATION.  THUS, ALL OBSERVERS PREDICT THAT THE </p><p>    LEGISLATION WILL BE LAW WELL BEFORE THE END OF JUNE, AND </p><p>CERTAINLY IN TIME FOR ITALY TO ASSUME THE EU PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PRIME MINISTER WILL NOW </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT SCHEDULED HEARING FOR HIS JUDICIAL </p><p>BRIBERY TRIAL (THE "SME" CASE, REF B AND PREVIOUS) ON JUNE </p><p>25.  HE COULD DO SO FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS OR OTHER REASONS, </p><p>BUT WOULD APPEAR NOT TO BE REQUIRED TO DO SO UNDER THE NEW </p><p>LAW.  HIS LAWYERS ARE EXPECTED TO REQUEST A SUSPENSION OF </p><p>PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE NEW LAW AT THAT SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) MOST OBSERVERS ARE ALSO PREDICTING, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>EITHER THE MILAN COURT CONSIDERING THE SME CASE OR THE </p><p>MAGISTRATE PROSECUTING IT WILL REQUEST A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVIEW OF THE LEGISLATION.  OPPOSITION PROTESTERS WITHIN AND </p><p>OUT OF PARLIAMENT HAVE VOCIFEROUSLY ASSERTED THAT THE LAW IS </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  SUCH ACTION IS VERY LIKELY, ALBEIT NOT </p><p>GUARANTEED, TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE LEGISLATION ITSELF </p><p>-- PUSHING FURTHER ACTION ON THE BERLUSCONI CASE DOWN THE </p><p>ROAD INDEFINITELY.  CENTRIST, BUSINESS-ORIENTED "IL SOLE 24 </p><p>ORE" WROTE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS USED "PARTICULAR </p><p>CAUTION" WITH CASES CONCERNING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN </p><p>PARLIAMENT (WE WOULD SAY THE GOVERNMENT) AND THE MAGISTRACY; </p><p>AT LEAST ONE CASE SEEKING A DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE </p><p>COMPETENCIES FOR EACH HAS BEEN PENDING BEFORE THE COURT FOR </p><p>SOME TWO YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNING COALITION HAS ALSO </p><p>INTRODUCED DRAFT LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO </p><p>PROVIDE BROADER PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY, MIRRORING LEGISLATION </p><p>RECENTLY ENACTED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT.  (THE IMMUNITY </p><p>    WOULD APPLY TO BERLUSCONI, SENATE PRESIDENT PERA, AND CHAMBER </p><p>PRESIDENT CASINI BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIMULTANEOUS STATUS AS </p><p>ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIANS; A PROVISION COULD ALSO BE MADE FOR </p><p>THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC AND OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COURT.)  THE LEGISLATION IS IN THE SENATE.  A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENT REQUIRES TWO READINGS, SEPARATED BY 90 DAYS, IN </p><p>EACH HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT.  DEPENDING ON THE VOTE COUNT, IT </p><p>CAN ALSO REQUIRE A NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  IT IS THEREFORE </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT BY THE TIME THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WERE TO </p><p>REVIEW THE CURRENT LEGISLATION, THE PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD </p><p>RENDER THE WHOLE DISCUSSION MOOT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  WE PREDICT A TRIAL-FREE EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>FOR PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, AND ALMOST CERTAINLY A </p><p>TRIAL-FREE REMAINDER OF HIS TERM IN OFFICE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02799 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
