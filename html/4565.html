WFP/GUINEA DISTRIBUTES THE SCHEDULE WIDELY AND </p><p>PRIDES ITSELF IN MAINTAINING THE ANNOUNCED SCHEDULE. </p><p>BUT AWARE OF THE CHANGING NEEDS IN THE REGION, WFP IS </p><p>WILLING TO ADJUST THE SCHEDULE AS NEEDED TO BE </p><p>RESPONSIVE TO EMERGING NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PASSENGER INFORMATION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.

AGENCIES, </p><p>INCLUDING 882 FROM UNHCR, 849 FROM WFP AND 195 FROM </p><p>UNICEF.  IN JULY, THE PLANE TRANSPORTED 648 </p><p>PASSENGERS:  ITS HIGHEST NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IN ONE </p><p>MONTH.  IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, THE MONTHLY PASSENGER </p><p>AVERAGE WAS 572. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP OPERATES A LET-410 THAT IS REGISTERED IN </p><p>BULGARIA AND IS FLOWN BY BULGARIAN PILOTS.  THE </p><p>AIRCRAFT HAS A 17-SEAT CAPACITY, HOWEVER FOR SAFETY </p><p>REASONS RELATED TO THE TEMPERATURE AND ATMOSPHERIC </p><p>CONDITIONS IN WEST AFRICA, WFP ALLOWS ONLY 12 </p><p>PASSENGERS PER FLIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>9.

IN ADDITION, UNHCR PERSONNEL ARE </p><p>PRIORITY PASSENGERS FOR THE PLANE, CONSEQUENTLY, NGO </p><p>AND OTHER U.N. AGENCY STAFF ARE OFTEN BUMPED FROM THE </p><p>FLIGHT.  INTERESTINGLY, 882 UNHCR STAFF FLEW ON THE </p><p>WFP PLANE IN THE LAST YEAR--THE LARGEST NUMBER OF </p><p>STAFF FROM ANY ONE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05788  03 OF 03  021339Z </p><p>12.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS </p><p>(ICRC) ALSO FLIES A REGIONAL AIRCRAFT.  ICRC HAS TOLD </p><p>WFP STAFF THAT THEY MAY USE IT IN EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS MEDICAL EVACUATION, BUT IT IS </p><p>NOT AVAILABLE TO NGOS AND OTHER U.N. AGENCIES.  THE </p><p>ICRC PLANE (10-PASSENGER CAPACITY) IS BASED IN </p><p>FREETOWN, AND FLIES TO THE FOREST REGION OF GUINEA </p><p>TWICE A WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>COSTS AND POSSIBLE SHUT-DOWN OF SERVICE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE COSTS OF MAINTAINING AND FLYING THE WFP </p><p>AIRCRAFT ARE 100,000 USD PER MONTH OR 1.2 MILLION USD </p><p>FOR 12 MONTHS, AS WFP\'S NEW FLIGHT SCHEDULE INCREASES </p><p>THE FLIGHT HOURS TO 100 HOURS PER MONTH.  IN THE LAST </p><p>YEAR, WFP AVERAGED 80 FLIGHT HOURS PER MONTH OR </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 75,000-80,000 USD PER MONTH, WHICH </p><p>ALLOWED WFP TO STRETCH ITS FUNDING (OF APPROXIMATELY </p><p>867,300 USD) TO COVER THE 12 MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  BESIDES THE DONATIONS IT RECEIVED, WFP BORROWED </p><p>DURING THE SUMMER SOME FUNDS FROM OTHER OPERATIONS IN </p><p>ORDER TO COVER GAPS IN FUNDING AND CONTINUE THE </p><p>SERVICE FOR A FEW MONTHS.  WFP HAS NOW REACHED A </p><p>POINT WHERE IT EITHER MUST RECEIVE ADDITIONAL </p><p>DONATIONS OR PLEDGES BY DECEMBER 7 OR SHUT DOWN THE </p><p>OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05788  03 OF 03  021339Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE WFP REGIONAL AIRCRAFT SUPPLIES A VALUED </p><p>SERVICE TO THE REGION\'S HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY.  ITS </p><p>DISCONTINUANCE WOULD SEVERELY HAMPER HUMANITARIAN </p><p>OPERATIONS, AS HUMANITARIAN WORKERS AND DONORS WOULD </p><p>BE FORCED TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES.  (THE DISTANCE </p><p>FROM CONAKRY TO N\'ZEREKORE IS 950 KILOMETERS AND </p><p>TAKES 15 HOURS TO TRAVEL, ONE WAY, BY VEHICLE.) </p><p> </p><p>16.  AS PROBLEMS IN THE WEST AFRICA REGION CONTINUE </p><p>TO GENERATE REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED </p><p>PERSONS, THE USEFULNESS OF THE PLANE IN REACHING AND </p><p>SERVICING THESE POPULATIONS IS CLEAR.  U.S. </p><p>MISSION/ROME SUGGESTS THAT STATE/PRM AND USAID/DCHA </p><p>STRONGLY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS SO IN </p><p>FY03. </p><p> </p><p>17.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
