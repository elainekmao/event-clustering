<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000649 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IPC:DRBEAN </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR: BURKY/ALVAREZ </p><p>DOC FOR LASHLEY </p><p>USPTO FOR URBAN </p><p>LOC FOR TEPP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, ECON, EINV, NI, IPR </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 2002 SPECIAL 301 REVIEW ON IPR </p><p>PROTECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 12498 (B) STATE 3106 (C) 01 LAGOS 647 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Mission provides response to ref A request for views on </p><p>Nigeria,s compliance with TRIPS and recent trends in IPR </p><p>protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Summary and Introduction: The Government of Nigeria (GON) </p><p>appears to be making progress bringing its IPR legislation </p><p>into compliance with TRIPS.  Areas where an inadequate </p><p>regulatory and legal framework exist are being targeted for </p><p>action by the key GON agencies, although whether proposed </p><p>enhanced IPR legislation will pass into law remains to be </p><p>seen.  Nevertheless, low cost piracy of optical media is </p><p>commonplace due not only to lack of enforcement resources and </p><p>trained enforcement staff, but also to inadequate public and </p><p>government understanding and appreciation of the benefits of </p><p>IPR protection.  In addition, Nigeria,s low per capita </p><p>income diminishes the likelihood of the successful </p><p>introduction of the more costly licensed products, which fall </p><p>outside the purchasing capability of most Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Licensed software dealers, such as Microsoft Nigeria, are </p><p>the primary catalysts for the recent upsurge in the </p><p>procurement of these products among Nigeria,s financial </p><p>institutions.  Ironically, the GON, as the largest user of </p><p>computers in the country, is also the largest consumer of </p><p>non-licensed computer products.  Reversing Nigeria,s weak </p><p>enforcement culture will be a difficult, long-term effort. </p><p>Because piracy is commonplace here, we must closely monitor </p><p>Nigeria\'s progress.  However, progress has been made. </p><p>Continued positive engagement is preferable to adding Nigeria </p><p>to the Watch List, and will likely produce better results. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>State of Intellectual Property Rights Regulation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Most of Nigeria,s IPR protective legislation complies </p><p>with TRIPS.  In 1999, amendments to the Nigerian Copyright </p><p>Law incorporated most TRIPS protections for copyrights, </p><p>except issues relating to Geographical Indications and the </p><p>protection of Undisclosed Information.  Four TRIPS-related </p><p>bills and amendments are currently in various stages of </p><p>legislative enactment. </p><p>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has </p><p>reviewed the first three of the acts listed (all except the </p><p>Breeders and Farmers Rights legislation) and, according to </p><p>the GON, determined that their enactment would bring Nigeria </p><p>into full compliance with TRIPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) A bill to establish an Intellectual Property Commission </p><p>(IPCON), merging the Nigerian Copyrights Commission (NCC) and </p><p>the Trademarks and Patents Registry, is now before the </p><p>National Assembly.  The draft law also provides for the new </p><p>commission to retain a portion of the revenue accruing to it </p><p>to fund operations and programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) An amendment to the Patents and Designs Act that will </p><p>make comprehensive provisions for the registration and </p><p>proprietorship of patents and designs is under review by the </p><p>Ministry of Justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) An amendment to the Trademarks Act that will improve </p><p>existing legislation relating to the recording, publishing, </p><p>and enforcement of trademarks is also under review by the </p><p>Ministry of Justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(d) Still in the drafting stage, a bill to provide for the </p><p>protection of plant varieties, animal breeders, and farmers </p><p>rights will ensure intellectual property rights protection </p><p>for genetically engineered agricultural products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Optical Media </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Nigeria is a large market for a wide range of pirated </p><p>optical media products.  The GON has slowly begun to take </p><p>measures to counter the problem.  The Copyright Amendment </p><p>Decree (1999) inserted a new section (18A) into the principal </p><p>Copyright Act (1988) which provides the Nigerian Copyright </p><p>Commission (NCC) additional anti-piracy powers.  The NCC </p><p>plans to prescribe the insertion of anti-piracy devices (e.g. </p><p>holograms) to checkmate copyright abuses as well as identify </p><p>real and pirated copies of sound recordings and </p><p>&cinematographic8 films intended for sale, rental, hiring, </p><p>lending, or other public distribution.  (Cinematographic </p><p>films are interpreted to include music CDs, video CDs, </p><p>CD-ROMs and DVDs.)  The NCC expects to launch this program in </p><p>March 2002 and reportedly has concluded arrangements with a </p><p>company to provide hologram stamps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Piracy of compact discs, video tapes, and other </p><p>copyrighted products is rampant.  To date, the GON has not </p><p>taken strong action against the pirate industry preferring, </p><p>for example, to attack videocassette rental shops rather than </p><p>manufacturers of pirated videocassettes.  Coordination among </p><p>law enforcement authorities remains poor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Computer Software </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The GON categorizes software as literary work and provides </p><p>copyright protection.  Microsoft and the Business Software </p><p>Alliance (BSA) have been instrumental in combating pirated </p><p>software.  To improve the regulator,s ability to enforce its </p><p>own laws, Microsoft Nigeria is providing the NCC training in </p><p>computer literacy and the identification of pirated software. </p><p> The company has also donated computers to the NCC to aid in </p><p>the discharge of its duties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Microsoft Nigeria launched a publicity campaign to explain </p><p>the benefits of respecting IPR.  Software development </p><p>companies in Nigeria reportedly prefer that Source </p><p>Identification Marks (SID) not be incorporated on their </p><p>media.  They opine that SID does not provide them enough </p><p>economies of scale benefits from such an exercise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. During 2001, the Nigerian financial services sector </p><p>aggressively shifted from being a user of pirated software to </p><p>becoming generally compliant with the procurement of licensed </p><p>products.  Microsoft Nigeria estimates that 65 percent of </p><p>Nigeria,s banks are at various levels of compliance with </p><p>procurement of licensed software.  Just one year ago, only a </p><p>few were compliant. This reversal is due, in part, to </p><p>Microsoft Nigeria and other local software companies </p><p>effectively promoting the long-term cost advantages and </p><p>customer protection benefits of using licensed products. </p><p>That Microsoft Nigeria continues to threaten noncompliant </p><p>financial institutions with court action has also helped. </p><p>The dramatic change in bank usage of licensed software is </p><p>also due to increased competitiveness among Nigeria,s banks </p><p>in the campaign to obtain an edge in information technology. </p><p>Many bankers now realize that pirated products often create </p><p>more problems than solutions in their effort to improve </p><p>customer service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Other large-scale software consumers, particularly the </p><p>insurance sector, discount houses, brokerage firms and </p><p>accountants, have yet to follow the lead of the banks. </p><p>Increased competition among these entities, and the continued </p><p>legal campaign against users of non-licensed software may </p><p>change this situation.  Microsoft Nigeria claims they have </p><p>achieved several out of court settlements leading to the use </p><p>of licensed products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>IPR Enforcement </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. GON enforcement of IPR laws remains ineffective. Woeful </p><p>lack of funding (the total budget for NCC,s IPR enforcement </p><p>nationwide was only USD 43,000 in 2001), inadequate </p><p>computerization to facilitate enforcement, and shortage of </p><p>skilled manpower contribute to the weak enforcement effort. </p><p>A key deficiency remains inadequate understanding and </p><p>appreciation among regulatory officials, distributor </p><p>networks, and consumers of the benefits from intellectual </p><p>property rights protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. NCC leadership admits they lack sufficient enforcement </p><p>officers to cover the entire country.  Some NCC offices are </p><p>not staffed with prosecutors which prevents concluded </p><p>investigations from going to trial.  According to the NCC, </p><p>the frequency of raids on manufacturers and distributors of </p><p>pirated materials depends on the availability of funds and </p><p>the lodging of complaints by rights holders.  While over 150 </p><p>IPR enforcement raids were allegedly carried out nationwide </p><p>in 2001, their impact has been negligible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. While the extent of GON consumption of pirated software </p><p>is unknown, the government itself is considered the most </p><p>egregious abuser of IPR.  Many, if not most government </p><p>offices, utilize pirated software.  To address IPR abuses </p><p>within the GON, the NCC is forced to go through a protracted </p><p>administrative process with the Ministry of Culture and </p><p>Tourism, which oversees the NCC.  Nevertheless, according to </p><p>the NCC, discussions aimed at ensuring that all government </p><p>agencies use appropriately licensed software are ongoing with </p><p>individual GON agencies.  The NCC is also pressing for the </p><p>establishment of a single clearance office for bulk </p><p>government purchases of licensed computer hardware and </p><p>software.  Additionally, the NCC claims it is unable to audit </p><p>firms with connections to important political figures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Most legal practitioners do not possess adequate </p><p>knowledge of intellectual property rights law to address IPR </p><p>properly in court, although a cadre of legal experts is </p><p>developing.  IPR cases are handled primarily by the Federal </p><p>High Court and High Court judges generally enjoy broad </p><p>familiarity with IPR protection law.  However, at the </p><p>Appellate Court level, a judge knowledgeable in IPR might not </p><p>be handling the case, and misapplication of the law is not </p><p>uncommon.  Lagos is the only region in Nigeria where most </p><p>judges have a reasonable knowledge of IPR.  The USG,s </p><p>Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) is working to </p><p>educate Nigerian civil and judicial officials on IPR through </p><p>educational seminars and training programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. In addition to the judiciary, Nigeria,s over-stretched </p><p>and under-trained police force lacks understanding of IPR. </p><p>Moreover, IPR protection is not a priority.  It is unlikely </p><p>that Nigeria,s police force, without assertive political </p><p>leadership, policy direction, and financial support from the </p><p>GON, can deter producers and vendors of pirated materials </p><p>from operating. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Although Nigeria is a large market for pirated goods, it </p><p>should not be included on the Watch List.  The Government is </p><p>making considerable efforts to shore up its legal and </p><p>regulatory framework.  For a variety of reasons, enforcement </p><p>remains poor but some steps have been taken.  Given the many </p><p>competing demands on the GON\'s resources, enforcement of IPR </p><p>is a secondary priority.  However, the GON has shown a </p><p>demonstrable, although weakly financed, commitment to IPR. </p><p>More importantly, government policies have opposed piracy not </p><p>condoned it.  Nigeria has much work to do but has some </p><p>willing actors in both the public and private sector.  Thus, </p><p>our interests are better served in providing encouragement </p><p>and positive reinforcement to these watch dogs and not </p><p>placing Nigeria on the list of worst offenders. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
