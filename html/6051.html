(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Summary:  According to press reports, several </p><p>labor camps outside of Abu Dhabi have in the past year </p><p>become centers for pirated video cassettes; workers </p><p>from south India record the latest movies on VHS tapes </p><p>and rent them out to consumers in Abu Dhabi at reduced </p><p>prices.  But UAE authorities have found an unlikely </p><p>ally in their efforts to eliminate the trade and are </p><p>turning to employers to educate their workers about </p><p>the legal risks of counterfeiting.  At the UAEG\'s </p><p>urging, contracting companies who manage the labor </p><p>camps are posting signs warning workers that the </p><p>company will take legal action against workers </p><p>involved in counterfeiting.  According to Abu Dhabi </p><p>police, this campaign has resulted during the last few </p><p>weeks in the imprisonment and deportation of dozens of </p><p>counterfeiters in the labor camps.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Local contracting companies are posting signs </p><p>in English and in the various languages of the </p><p>subcontinent warning employees that they will be fired </p><p>and referred to the police if they are engaging in </p><p>counterfeiting activity.  The notices also remind </p><p>employees that, under the new Copyright Law of 2002, </p><p>counterfeiters may face two to nine months </p><p>imprisonment and a fine ranging from USD $2,700 to </p><p>$55,000.  The penalty is doubled for repeat offenders </p><p>according to the number of copyrights violated. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) According to the Abu Dhabi police, these </p><p>laborers record movies on VHS tape and rent out 30 to </p><p>50 video cassettes each day at a rate far less than </p><p>that of authorized video dealers -- about USD $.50 to </p><p>$1 per video.  These pirated movies, according to the </p><p>police, reach the UAE via Pakistan and the Far East. </p><p>Most of the new Hindi movies are smuggled via Pakistan, </p><p>while Tamil movies come through Malaysia and Thailand. </p><p>English movies are smuggled by Chinese expatriates from </p><p>Hong Kong. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The UAEG is cracking down on the counterfeiters </p><p>in response to complaints by movie distributors, video </p><p>store owners, and local cinemas.  These businesses have </p><p>reported 50 percent losses in distribution and 60 </p><p>percent losses in their retail business during the last </p><p>year.  According to press reports, local merchants have </p><p>formed a committee to strategize with Abu Dhabi law </p><p>enforcement on ways to combat video piracy. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment:  The UAE authorities responsible for </p><p>copyright enforcement are stretched thin and </p><p>historically have relied on industry -- and, in this </p><p>case, the legitimate employers of the </p><p>workers-cum-counterfeiters -- to identify culprits and </p><p>illicit activity.  For workers in the labor camps, </p><p>termination by their employers and loss of income are </p><p>greater deterrents than imprisonment; contracting </p><p>companies likewise have an incentive to keep workers </p><p>under their sponsorship out of trouble. If this new </p><p>tactic significantly reduces counterfeiting in the </p><p>labor camps (and it is, according to press reports), </p><p>the UAEG is likely to expand its program of working </p><p>with local companies to ensure implementation of IPR </p><p>polices to sectors of the economy where counterfeiting </p><p>continues to be a problem.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
