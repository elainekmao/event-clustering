<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/13/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: IFES TEAM ASKED TO LEAVE ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) A WEEK AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN ZIMBABWE, A TWO-MEMBER </p><p>ADVANCE TEAM FROM THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION </p><p>SYSTEMS (IFES) WAS ASKED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE TO LEAVE </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  IFES AFRICA PROGRAM DIRECTOR TOM BAYER AND SENIOR </p><p>PROGRAM OFFICER LAURIE COOPER ARRIVED IN ZIMBABWE ON SEPTEMBER 5 </p><p>TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND </p><p>ELECTION PREPARATIONS, AND TO CLARIFY THE PARAMETERS OF IFES\'S </p><p>PROPOSED ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT.   THEY HAD PLANNED TO REMAIN </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 15.  DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO </p><p>MEET WITH THE KEY GOZ OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE IFES TEAM RAN INTO A BRICK WALL.  WHEN </p><p>BAYER SUBMITTED A LETTER SEEKING AN APPOINTMENT WITH REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL TOBAIWA MUDEDE, HE RECEIVED A CURT WRITTEN RESPONSE FROM </p><p>AN UNDERLING DECLINING THE REQUEST TO MEET AND ADDING THAT "WE </p><p>...WILL NOT NEED YOUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON ELECTION MATTERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF YOUR LAST U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THE CONTRARY.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN AFRICANS INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE OBSERVATION OF EUROPEAN/AMERICAN ELECTIONS...ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>SATISFACTORILY MANAGE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITHOUT YOUR </p><p>ASSISTANCE."  IN A SUBSEQUENT CHANCE MEETING, MUDEDE BERATED </p><p>COOPER, TELLING HER THAT THE GOZ WAS FULLY CAPABLE OF RUNNING ITS </p><p>ELECTIONS WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON SEPTEMBER 11, BAYER WAS VISITED AT HIS HOTEL BY THREE </p><p>MEN WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION </p><p>OFFICERS, ONE OF WHOM PRESENTED VERIFYING IDENTIFICATION.  THEY </p><p>ASKED WHAT THE TEAM WAS DOING HERE, WITH WHOM THEY WERE MEETING, </p><p>AND WHY BAYER AND COOPER THOUGHT IFES ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED.  THE </p><p>GOZ OFFICIALS REQUESTED THAT BAYER AND COOPER PRESENT THEMSELVES </p><p>LATER IN THE DAY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION\'S HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02690  131147Z </p><p>AT THE AFTERNOON MEETING, THE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS CITED "WORRY" </p><p>AND "SKEPTICISM" ABOUT IFES\'S ACTIVITIES, PLUS IFES\'S ALLEGED LACK </p><p>OF IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTATION AND FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT </p><p>NOTICE OF THE TEAM\'S ARRIVAL TO RELEVANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. </p><p>BAYER AND COOPER WERE TOLD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND APPLY FOR A </p><p>WORK PERMIT UPON THEIR RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE TWO WERE BEING DEPORTED, THE RANKING IMMIGRATION OFFICER SAID </p><p>"NO."  WHEN BAYER INQUIRED WHETHER HE AND COOPER WOULD BE </p><p>PERMITTED TO RETURN TO ZIMBABWE, THE GOZ OFFICIAL SAID THEY WOULD </p><p>BE WELCOME TO COME BACK "ON HOLIDAY." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BAYER TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON SEPTEMBER 13 THAT HE </p><p>AND COOPER PLANNED TO DEPART ZIMBABWE LATER THAT DAY.  IFES, HE </p><p>SAID, WOULD TAKE THE NEXT WEEK TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE TEAM\'S </p><p>DIFFICULTIES HERE AND SUBSEQUENTLY TOUCH BASE WITH THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>AND EMBASSY HARARE TO DISCUSS NEXT STEPS.  BAYER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>IFES HAD INITIALLY PREFERRED TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM </p><p>THE EMBASSY WHILE CONDUCTING ITS ACTIVITIES HERE.  HE THOUGHT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT A CHANGE IN TACTICS MIGHT NOW BE NECESSARY, AND THAT </p><p>THE EMBASSY MIGHT IN THE FUTURE HAVE TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE LIAISON </p><p>ROLE BETWEEN IFES AND THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS THE END OF THE ROAD HERE </p><p>FOR IFES AS AN ORGANIZATION OR THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS AS IFES </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES.  THE GOZ APPEARS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT IT DOES NOT </p><p>WANT OUTSIDERS (AT LEAST FROM THE WEST) OBSERVING THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND WE EXPECT THE GOZ TO TRY TO STYMIE IFES AT EVERY </p><p>TURN.  (N.B. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THIS DECISION IS IRREVOCABLE OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02690  131147Z </p><p>SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGIONAL AND NON-REGIONAL PRESSURES.)  WE </p><p>AGREE WITH BAYER THAT THE EMBASSY WILL NEED TO PLAY A MORE VISIBLE </p><p>ROLE IN SUPPORTING IFES IN-COUNTRY, INCLUDING KEEPING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE INFORMED OF THE TEAM\'S PROPOSED ACTIVITIES, </p><p>IF THEY ARE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT SUCCESS.   AS A FIRST STEP, WE </p><p>PLAN TO SEND A TEMPERATE DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE GOZ EXPRESSING OUR </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE IFES TEAM\'S DE FACTO EXPULSION, EMPHASIZING THAT </p><p>THEY ARE A HIGHLY-RESPECTED, INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND NOT PART OF THE USG.  WE INTEND TO EXPRESS OUR </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THEIR WORK HERE, AND SEEK CLARIFICATION OF THE </p><p>PROCEDURES IFES MUST FOLLOW IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  WE RECOMMEND HOLDING ANY OTHER ACTIONS IN ABEYANCE </p><p>UNTIL WE RECEIVE AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE, THE SUBSTANCE </p><p>(AND TONE) OF WHICH SHOULD GUIDE OUR NEXT STEPS.   WE NOTE FOR THE </p><p>RECORD THAT MUDEDE HAS ALSO REFUSED TO MEET WITH THE EU OFFICIAL </p><p>SENT HERE TO PREPARE A LONG-TERM MONITORING INITIATIVE SIMILAR TO </p><p>THE ONE ENVISAGED BY IFES. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
