(A) Toronto 1714(Ontario SARS Update #39) </p><p>     (B) Ottawa 1167 (Canada Wide Status Report #7) </p><p>1. As of June 9, 2003, Health Canada has received </p><p>reports of 424 probable or suspect cases of severe </p><p>acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada.  There </p><p>have been 33 deaths in Canada.  Canadian officials </p><p>maintain that to date, transmission has been limited to </p><p>specific transmission settings such as households, </p><p>hospitals and specific community settings.  Health </p><p>Canada has provided the following figures, accurate as </p><p>of 13:00 EDT June 9, 2003: </p><p>2. The epicenter for SARS cases remains Toronto, </p><p>Ontario with 225 probable (66 active) and 136 suspect </p><p>(9 active) cases. See Toronto reporting for more </p><p>detail. </p><p>3. There are no active cases in the remainder of the </p><p>country. </p><p>4. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable (0 active) </p><p>and 46 suspect (0 active) cases. Representing a net </p><p>reduction of 8 suspect cases since the last Canada-wide </p><p>update April 25th. </p><p>5. Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect (0 active) case. </p><p>No change since the Canada-wide update of April 25th. </p><p>6. New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases (0 </p><p>active).  No change since the Canada-wide update of </p><p>April 25th. </p><p>7. Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases (0 active).

No change since the Canada-wide update of </p><p>April 25th. </p><p>9. No reported cases of SARS in Quebec, Newfoundland, </p><p>Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Nunavut, Yukon or </p><p>Northwest Territories. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Health Canada broadens case definition for SARS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10. On May 29, Health Canada announced that Canada is </p><p>aligning its clinical description of symptoms and signs </p><p>of SARS with that of the WHO. </p><p> </p><p>11. The previous definition of "severe progressive </p><p>respiratory illness suggestive of atypical pneumonia or </p><p>acute respiratory syndrome (RDS) with no known cause" </p><p>has been replaced with: "radiographic evidence in </p><p>infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory </p><p>distress syndrome on chest x-ray with no known cause </p><p>that can fully explain the illness." </p><p> </p><p>12. According to Health Canada, the revised case </p><p>definition for probable and suspect cases will not make </p><p>a difference in the way cases are treated nor how cases </p><p>are identified.  Cases that are suspect or under </p><p>investigation have always required appropriate </p><p>treatment or attention. </p><p> </p><p>13. The WHO and provincial and territorial officials </p><p>have been apprised of the new definition. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
