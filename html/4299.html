O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Will the Economy Implode? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The Government of Robert Mugabe has </p><p>impoverished nearly every Zimbabwean, a case of </p><p>collective downward mobility rarely experienced in </p><p>countries not at war.  A gardener who earned US$ </p><p>150/month at independence in 1980 now takes home less </p><p>than US$ 15.  As the economy continues to shrink -- by </p><p>one percent each month at last count -- so do the GoZ\'s </p><p>options to stave off meltdown.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The ultimate interventionist government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>2. Over the past 5 years, the GoZ has left few internal </p><p>markets to self-regulation.  It has insisted on an </p><p>unsupported and unrealistic official exchange rate; </p><p>transferred farmland from productive businesspeople to </p><p>government-owned collectives, turning -- to cite just one </p><p>crop -- the planet\'s number one tobacco export nation </p><p>into a minor player; let squatters live off quality </p><p>farmland by poaching, felling trees and panning for gold; </p><p>drawn private pension funds\' once formidable savings into </p><p>its own coffers by holding interest rates on short-term </p><p>treasuries to approximately one-tenth the real inflation </p><p>rate; and acted as sole price arbiter for fuel, gold, </p><p>grain, maize, milk, bread and other staples. </p><p> </p><p>3.  These policies have nearly destroyed Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>formal economy, sent 10-20 percent of the population </p><p>packing and put half those remaining at risk of </p><p>starvation.  Overtly, the GoZ still engages in denial. </p><p>An editorialist in the GoZ\'s press refuted British </p><p>charges of bad policy last week, shooting back:  "There </p><p>are, in Britain today, and standing outside the doors of </p><p>Westminster and Windsor Castle right now, thousands of </p><p>people with neither food nor shelter, sleeping rough, and </p><p>all driven by want and poverty."  Despite this </p><p>feistiness, even the architects of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>"unconventional" economic policy entertain private </p><p>doubts. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------- </p><p>4. The GoZ\'s interventionist approach has been about </p><p>control -- of food, farmland, fuel, currency exchange and </p><p>most other facets of economic activity.  In the end, this </p><p>control may prove lethal, even though foreign food </p><p>assistance and a burgeoning informal economy may sustain </p><p>the country for a while.  Still, almost every discussion </p><p>with Zimbabwe\'s top-flight economists (there are still </p><p>dozens) comes around to the chances of total implosion. </p><p>Many believe a prolonged lack of fuel could be the </p><p>trigger, though there are other scenarios.  Undoubtedly, </p><p>intervention is strangling the economy, and </p><p>liberalization without International Monetary Fund or </p><p>other support is very tricky. The CEO of a large bank </p><p>told us 80 percent of his borrowers would default if he </p><p>were allowed to raise interest rates to their natural </p><p>level.  Similarly, ordinary Zimbabweans cannot endure the </p><p>inflationary jolt of a 7-to-10-fold increase in fuel </p><p>(i.e., international pricing) when the GoZ stops </p><p>subsidizing. </p><p> </p><p>5. Can things just muddle along?  Economists point out </p><p>the GoZ still has a few hard-currency assets left to </p><p>expropriate, sell or barter, such as the foreign currency </p><p>accounts of Zimbabweans who worked abroad from 1991-97 </p><p>(permitted by an old law) or equity in Air Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>Boeing fleet of 2 767s and 3 737s.  The GoZ has </p><p>reportedly already passed several national assets to the </p><p>Libyans for fuel.  However, this may only slow but not </p><p>halt an inexorable "meltdown clock." </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
