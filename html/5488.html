<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000765 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV - LAWLESS </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/MWILLIAMSON </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, BEXP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S AMCHAM PLANS 2003 PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (u)  With the regional outlook uncertain for the coming </p><p>months, the Board of Directors of JABA, Jordan\'s AmCham, have </p><p>restructured their event planning for 2003.  They are </p><p>shifting more of their events to late in the year and </p><p>planning more trips to the U.S. in an effort to keep momentum </p><p>going from the December Joint Economic Committee (JEC), while </p><p>recognizing the difficulty of enticing investors, speakers, </p><p>or business partners to Amman in the spring/summer timeframe. </p><p> As JABA\'s plans develop, we will be in contact with </p><p>interested Washington agencies for follow-up and support. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AJEX RESCHEDULED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  In a meeting with the Ambassador on January 26, </p><p>JABA\'s Board of Directors outlined an ambitious yet practical </p><p>plan for 2003 to keep interest levels in the FTA and QIZ up </p><p>in the U.S., and to keep JABA members active in promoting the </p><p>FTA and building on the relationships they established with </p><p>American partners during the December JEC meeting in </p><p>Washington.  Of particular note, JABA has decided to </p><p>reschedule AJEX, the American products exhibition and seminar </p><p>series, to the end of September.  the JABA Board had </p><p>originally planned to hold AJEX in late March, but found it </p><p>increasingly difficult to secure commitments from sponsors, </p><p>speakers, or participants from the U.S. to attend an event in </p><p>Amman in that timeframe.  JABA hopes the new date will avoid </p><p>complications from any potential conflict with Iraq in the </p><p>spring, and will also avoid a scheduling crunch with a </p><p>similar event, World Trade Week, which is currently scheduled </p><p>for early June.  In addition, the September date will allow </p><p>JABA to tie AJEX in with the second annual JEC meeting, which </p><p>Trade Minister Bashir has informally said should be held in </p><p>Amman in September.  JABA will continue to seek strong </p><p>Embassy, USAID, and FCS support to maximize the impact of </p><p>AJEX. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3 CITIES/3 SECTORS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Following on discussions with Commerce DAS </p><p>Williamson in December, JABA is planning a 3 cities/3 sectors </p><p>tour of the U.S. for late March/early April.  JABA has </p><p>already received a letter of support from DAS Williamson, and </p><p>is in the process of identifying the industry sectors to be </p><p>represented on the tour and the cities and program they hope </p><p>to put together.  This tour to the U.S. is in place of the </p><p>visit of a delegation of U.S. business associations that had </p><p>been planned for the original AJEX dates in late March. </p><p>Through this tour, JABA hopes both to help Jordanian industry </p><p>leaders develop ties with U.S. partners (import, export, </p><p>distribution, and/or marketing), and to keep the U.S.-Jordan </p><p>FTA in the news in the U.S., at least among targeted </p><p>audiences in trade and industrial sectors. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>U.S. TIJARA COUNTERPART </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  JABA will be working over the coming year with the </p><p>Jordanian Embassy in Washington and with NUSACC and the U.S. </p><p>Chamber of Commerce to encourage U.S. business associations </p><p>and/or companies to form a counterpart organization to the </p><p>TIJARA initiative currently underway in Jordan.  The concept </p><p>is to form a roundtable of "friends of Jordan" that will meet </p><p>regularly to discuss FTA opportunities, economic developments </p><p>in Jordan, and upcoming trade and industry events.  JABA </p><p>hopes to get either NUSACC or (preferably) the U.S. Chamber </p><p>to be the "champion" of such a group, which they see as a </p><p>vehicle for educating and advertising in the U.S. business </p><p>community about economic opportunities in Jordan.  The </p><p>Jordanian Embassy in Washington will also participate, and </p><p>will likely encourage appropriate officers from State, </p><p>Commerce, and USTR (at a minimum) to take part in the </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>REGIONAL AMCHAM </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  JABA\'s final major initiative for 2003 is to talk to </p><p>AmChams in the MENA region about establishing a regional </p><p>AmCham body that could meet regularly and share data on </p><p>members in an effort to multiply the benefits of increased </p><p>U.S. interest in Jordan into expanded business relationships </p><p>among Arab companies with U.S. market interests.  The idea </p><p>would be modeled on the GCC AmCham.  As a first step, we are </p><p>encouraging JABA to develop contacts with their Moroccan </p><p>counterparts in anticipation of the conclusion of a </p><p>U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement.  While much of Jordan\'s </p><p>business community fears such an agreement, JABA is </p><p>increasingly taking the view that such an agreement will </p><p>actually create new opportunities for cooperation among </p><p>Moroccan and Jordanian businesses, which could use cumulation </p><p>of origin concepts to develop new business alliances to </p><p>export to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  JABA\'s plans are a practical reaction to the current </p><p>uncertainty in the region, which they see as likely to </p><p>continue for several months.  By shifting their programs away </p><p>from Jordan and into the U.S. and other regional countries, </p><p>JABA hopes to maintain the momentum of new business </p><p>relationships being developed under the FTA, and especially </p><p>through the JEC mechanism.  We will be working with JABA to </p><p>develop many of these programs, and will be in contact with </p><p>interested Washington agencies as appropriate for follow-up </p><p>and support.  Most immediately, we are following up with JABA </p><p>on recent discussions we had with DoC regarding the 3 </p><p>cities/3 sectors program and the TIJARA counterpart </p><p>initiative. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
