<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004361 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN WELCOMES FORMATION OF IRAQI GOVERNING </p><p>COUNCIL "WITH CAUTION" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 202537 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2294 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Charge and PolCouns presented ref a points on </p><p>formation of the Iraqi Governing Council July 15 to Ali </p><p>al-Ayed, the new Director of Foreign Minister Muasher\'s </p><p>Private Office, and Samer Dabbas, the Private Office Iraq </p><p>action officer.  Charge emphasized that the formation of the </p><p>Council is based on UNSCR 1483, that the council will have </p><p>real authority, and that it is a serious step toward the </p><p>formation of a new Iraqi government. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Ayed noted that FonMin Muasher on July 14 had </p><p>welcomed the council in a joint press conference with Russian </p><p>FonMin Ivanov (septel).  (Note:  Muasher called the Council </p><p>"a positive step, hopefully towards the formation of a </p><p>government elected by the Iraqi people and that would </p><p>transcend sectarian representation."  end note.)  However, </p><p>Ayed continued, Jordan has several concerns about the Council </p><p>and welcomes it "with caution."  First, Jordan is concerned </p><p>that 13 of the 25 members are Shia, and worries that all </p><p>decisions will be made on a sectarian basis and therefore by </p><p>the Shia majority.  Charge and PolCouns responded that the </p><p>composition of the Council is meant to mirror broadly the </p><p>composition of the Iraqi people.  Second, Ayed argued, Jordan </p><p>does not want the new Iraqi government to be a federation </p><p>which could encourage the future "fragmentation" of Iraq. </p><p>Third, Dabbas said Jordan would have preferred to see more </p><p>technocrats and fewer politicians on the Council.  The Charge </p><p>pointed out that CPA has retained many of the technocrats </p><p>from the previous regime in the senior ranks of the </p><p>ministries.   Finally, Ayed said Jordan would be concerned if </p><p>INC leader Ahmed Chalabi becomes head of the Governing </p><p>Council, reiterating Jordan\'s legal and political concerns </p><p>about seeing Chalabi in a leadership role in Iraq (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  COMMENT:  Jordan strongly supports the coalition\'s </p><p>effort to create a unified, stable, democratic, and </p><p>prosperous Iraq.  The caution with which the GOJ greeted the </p><p>Governing Council is based mostly on Jordanian fears of what </p><p>could go wrong -- especially a fear of the emergence of a </p><p>Shia dominated state on its eastern border. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
