<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000351 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL </p><p>CORRECTED COPY OF KATHMANDU 0329 - TEXT MODIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, EAID, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: USG HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY FOR NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 13790 </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  In CY 02 our Mission engaged with the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON), the military, and members of civil society on a </p><p>variety of fronts to advance the USG human rights agenda. </p><p>Such programs have addressed needs in areas as diverse as </p><p>voter education; advocacy in a democracy; trafficking in </p><p>persons; child labor; civic education; women\'s political </p><p>participation; press freedom; rehabilitation of torture </p><p>victims; the Law of Armed Conflict;  and the investigation of </p><p>human rights abuses by the military.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY/ </p><p>WOMEN\'S RIGHTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  To address Nepal\'s weak democratic institutions, our </p><p>USAID Mission has worked with the host government, civil </p><p>society and American NGOs to bolster support for free and </p><p>fair elections.  A two-year voter education program, funded </p><p>at USD 609,696, trained 180 district election officials and </p><p>1,227 civic/political leaders from 30 districts in proper </p><p>election procedures.  The program also printed and </p><p>distributed 50,000 voter awareness booklets with pertinent </p><p>election laws and 70,000 voters\' resource manuals.  In </p><p>addition, 30 episodes of a radio drama on voters\' rights and </p><p>responsibilities were aired in 10 local languages.  As a </p><p>result, district election officials, local political party </p><p>and civic leaders, as well as general voters, benefited from </p><p>increased awareness of election procedures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  To help support an expanded role for women in the </p><p>electoral process, the USAID Mission has funded a two-year </p><p>program (begun in late FY 01) in increase women\'s political </p><p>participation by preparing approximately 4,000 female </p><p>candidates for upcoming local body elections.  To date USD </p><p>628,304 has been obligated in this program.  After local </p><p>elections were postponed in mid-2002, implementing partners </p><p>adapted the program to focus on preparing training materials, </p><p>surveying women leaders to identify potential candidates, and </p><p>conducting a needs assessment of 400 local female </p><p>representatives.  Public Diplomacy (PD) also conducted a </p><p>series of workshops on women\'s empowerment in various </p><p>locations across the country, including some focused on </p><p>women\'s participation in the media. </p><p> </p><p>4.  During CY 2002 the USAID Mission continued a cooperative </p><p>agreement, begun in FY 01, to strengthen advocacy and local </p><p>government accountability.  To date USD 689,070 has been </p><p>obligated.  This program aims to achieve strengthened </p><p>capacity of federations/coalitions of natural resource user </p><p>groups and women\'s groups to advocate for member interests </p><p>and increased scrutiny of government performance in the </p><p>allocation and management of funds for local development.  To </p><p>date, 366 lead group members have been trained, who have in </p><p>turn trained another 593 members of forest and irrigation </p><p>users\' groups and women\'s groups.  The women\'s coalitions </p><p>have engaged in advocacy campaigns on a wide variety of </p><p>issues, including the dowry system; leadership training; </p><p>employment conditions for women in hotels and restaurants; </p><p>reservation of 25 percent of local government budgets for </p><p>women\'s development; and combating witchcraft accusations. </p><p>USAID has signed a second cooperative agreement for a similar </p><p>three-year program, funded at USD 750,000, that will expand </p><p>this program to additional districts in mid-western and </p><p>far-western regions of the country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  To increase awareness of citizens\' rights and </p><p>responsibilities in Nepal\'s relatively young democracy, the </p><p>PD section sponsored a program to develop a civic education </p><p>curriculum for schools in at least 15 districts.  The </p><p>curriculum has been so successfully received that the </p><p>Ministry of Education plans to implement its use in grades </p><p>10-12 and has asked for complementary materials for use at </p><p>the primary school level.  In CY 02 USD 164,451 was spent on </p><p>this program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  In March PD sponsored a lecture program on "The </p><p>Individual Citizen and Democracy:  Rights and </p><p>Responsibilities."  In June PD sponsored two seminars for </p><p>members of civil society, the government, and the judiciary </p><p>on "The Difference Between Human Rights and Citizens\' Rights" </p><p>and "Human Rights and the Rule of Law" in Kathmandu and </p><p>Pokhara respectively. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ANTI-TRAFFICKING/ </p><p>CHILD LABOR </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  In FY 01-02 the Mission supported anti-trafficking </p><p>programs that included training for local government </p><p>anti-trafficking task forces, overseas employment agency </p><p>rights training, dissemination of information on safe </p><p>migration, psycho-social counseling, and anti-trafficking </p><p>network strengthening.  To date USD 900,000 has been </p><p>obligated for these activities.  Participants included </p><p>vulnerable women and girls, teachers and students, staff of </p><p>transit homes for returning victims of trafficking, members </p><p>of local government and transport workers.  USAID-funded </p><p>programs also reviewed the SAARC Convention on Preventing and </p><p>Combating Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution </p><p>from a human rights perspective, as well as a study of </p><p>Nepal\'s labor and migration laws in the context of </p><p>trafficking and women\'s right to migrate.  The latter study </p><p>found that restrictions on women\'s overseas employment in </p><p>fact made it more likely that women would resort to illegal </p><p>migration, thus making them more vulnerable to being </p><p>trafficked.  (Note:  Legal restrictions on women\'s right to </p><p>travel to the Gulf for employment have since been lifted. </p><p>End note.)  In CY 02 the Mission also funded a program </p><p>through UNICEF to provide computer equipment and to design a </p><p>database for police units specifically charged with </p><p>controlling trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The USG Department of Labor has committed USD 5 million </p><p>for a comprehensive, three-year, "time-bound" program to </p><p>eliminate the worst forms of child labor.  This program is </p><p>being implemented through the ILO and the NGO World </p><p>Education. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSURGENCY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9.  For the past seven years, Nepal has been gripped by a </p><p>violent domestic Maoist insurgency in which nearly 7,000 </p><p>people have been killed.  After the Maoists unilaterally </p><p>broke a ceasefire with a series of attacks on the security </p><p>forces in November 2001, King Gyanendra, on the advice of the </p><p>Prime Minister, mobilized the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and </p><p>declared a state of emergency that suspended many basic civil </p><p>rights.  Human rights has been a central part of our </p><p>bilateral dialogue at all levels of our interactions with the </p><p>police, the army, and the civilian government throughout the </p><p>year.  In June PD sponsored guest speaker lectures for </p><p>journalists, editors, and the government on "Freedom of </p><p>Information During a State of Emergency."  The Embassy and </p><p>DAO have maintained an active dialogue on the subject of </p><p>human rights with RNA commanders during CY 02, arguing that </p><p>respect for civilian rights is a tactical necessity in </p><p>counterinsurgency as well as a moral imperative of a </p><p>democratic government.  Our repeated demarches demonstrably </p><p>have influenced the human rights sensitivity of top military </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Emboff and DATT met with the RNA to inquire about the </p><p>arrests of two human rights activists and two journalists in </p><p>March; the four were subsequently released without charge </p><p>later in the month.  The Embassy has pursued a number of </p><p>cases, including some apparent extrajudicial killings, with </p><p>the RNA\'s human rights cell.  In one of these cases, the RNA </p><p>has provisionally disciplined two soldiers involved.  Further </p><p>investigation into this case was pending at year\'s end.  In </p><p>CY 03 the Embassy plans to coordinate assistance to the </p><p>respective human rights cells of the three branches of the </p><p>security forces (RNA, civil police, Armed Police Force) with </p><p>the British. </p><p> </p><p>11.  In September the Embassy\'s Offices of Defense </p><p>Cooperation (ODC) and Public Diplomacy jointly sponsored the </p><p>participation of two lecturers from the Defense Institute of </p><p>International Legal Studies in a two-day seminar on the Law </p><p>of Armed Conflict and Rules of Engagement for at least 20 RNA </p><p>officers at the rank of colonel and above.  In December a </p><p>Department of Defense Mobile Training Team exercise, funded </p><p>through IMET, trained the RNA on civil affairs. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Ambassador pressed the Prime Minister and Foreign </p><p>Ministry officials to conclude a long-pending headquarters </p><p>agreeement with an international INGO and to allow the INGO </p><p>access to detainees in military barracks.  (Note:  The </p><p>headquarters agreement was subsequently signed in January </p><p>2003.  End note.)  By the end of the year, the INGO had been </p><p>allowed at least one visit to a military barracks. </p><p> </p><p>13.  In June the USAID Mission initiated a project to </p><p>rehabilitate torture victims and build capacity among health </p><p>professionals that deal with torture victims.  Under a </p><p>cooperative agreement with the Center for Victims of Torture </p><p>(CVICT), more than 1,000 torture victims and their families </p><p>will receive comprehensive medical and psychological care, as </p><p>well as legal counseling.  Mobile treatment clinics also </p><p>conduct community awareness programs to inform rural </p><p>communities of their rights and the legal and therapeutic </p><p>recourse available to them.  Fact-finding teams (composed of </p><p>a doctor, a lawyer, and a journalist) investigate, document </p><p>and report credible accounts of torture.  CVICT will train </p><p>100 medical professionals in medico-legal aspects of </p><p>examination, documentation, and reporting cases of torture </p><p>and rape.  The total budget for the project is USD 600,000. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
