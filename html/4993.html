<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000042 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ ESCALATES PRESSURE ON MDC MAYORS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) On January 6 and 7 the government-owned The Herald </p><p>reported that the GOZ would soon appoint governors for the </p><p>cities of Harare and Bulawayo.  The move comes amid a general </p><p>GOZ campaign to discredit, obstruct, or supersede MDC mayors </p><p>and city councils.  The GOZ\'s strategy could be risky, as the </p><p>MDC\'s five mayors nationwide were elected with comfortable </p><p>margins by voters who are growing more desperate by the day. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Appointees for MDC Strongholds </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) On January 6 and 7 the government-owned The Herald </p><p>reported that the GOZ would soon appoint governors for the </p><p>cities of Harare and Bulawayo.  Until now, only rural </p><p>provinces have had governors.  Minister of Local Government </p><p>Ignatius Chombo said that President Mugabe\'s declaration to </p><p>this effect was gazetted on January 3, however according to </p><p>the city of Harare Chief Public Relations Officer, Cuthbert </p><p>Rwazemba, the city has not yet received official </p><p>notification.  Harare and Bulawayo, which are legally </p><p>considered provinces under the 1980 Provincial Councils Act, </p><p>would be divided into eight and five districts respectively. </p><p>Until now the status as provinces of these urban centers was </p><p>only relevant for administrative purposes during elections. </p><p>Chombo said the mayors of Bulawayo and Harare would "have </p><p>specific duties to perform under their governors" and the </p><p>legal modalities for this structure had already been worked </p><p>out.  Rwazemba expects the GOZ will also appoint district </p><p>administrators (DA) for the new districts, and said the moves </p><p>are being seen as a GOZ effort to curtail the power of the </p><p>MDC in urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Constitution limits the number of presidentially </p><p>appointed governors sitting in Parliament to the existing </p><p>eight. It is unclear how the GOZ will provide Parliamentary </p><p>seats to the two new governors, although, Chombo said he was </p><p>confident that Minister of Justice--and ZANU-PF leader in the </p><p>Parliament--Patrick Chinamasa would find a solution. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Mayor Besieged by ZANU-PF Youth </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) This latest move comes as part of a concerted GOZ </p><p>campaign to harass and obstruct mayors elected on MDC </p><p>tickets.  On November 29 about forty ZANU-PF youths, </p><p>including at least two Chegutu municipal workers attacked </p><p>Chegutu Mayor, Francis Dhlakama, in his office.  The </p><p>attackers accused Dhlakama of insulting Phineas Mariyapera, </p><p>the deputy mayor.  The crowd also assaulted a police officer </p><p>who attempted to assist Dhlakama during the assault, and </p><p>punctured three tires on Dhlakama\'s official vehicle.  The </p><p>assailants used axes, iron bars, golf clubs, fire </p><p>extinguishers, and rocks to break into the Mayor\'s offices in </p><p>the attempt to get at the Mayor.  A computer, carpet and </p><p>documents were damaged in the siege.  (Note: Fearing for </p><p>their safety, Dhlakama subsequently approached the Ambassador </p><p>requesting assistance to send his family abroad so he could </p><p>continue his work.  Poloff arranged with the Konrad Adenauer </p><p>Foundation, and Amani Trust, a local human rights </p><p>organization, to send the family to Capetown for a few </p><p>months.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Minister Spars Publicly with MDC Mayor </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) In what has become a running attack publicized in the </p><p>government-owned press Minister of Local Government Ignatius </p><p>Chombo has criticized the Mayor of Harare, Elias Mudzuri, for </p><p>allegedly politicizing the water shortage in Harare, for </p><p>obstructing housing development, for hiring opposition </p><p>supporters, and most recently for politicizing city </p><p>contracts.  Mudzuri has fought back with equal strength in </p><p>the independent press accusing Chombo of similar offenses, </p><p>and challenging him to a televised debate, a challenge Chombo </p><p>has yet to accept. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In a more significant move, Chombo has appointed a </p><p>temporary commission charged with helping Mudzuri develop a </p><p>"turnaround plan" for Harare.  This action was widely </p><p>interpreted as an attempt to undermine Mudzuri, who was </p><p>beginning to make noticeable improvements to the city\'s </p><p>roads, streetlights, and traffic signals. </p><p> </p><p>City Councils Refuse Order to Report to DAs </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) The Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe (UCAZ), an </p><p>association of urban mayors and council chairpersons, met on </p><p>November 6 in Harare to discuss an October 4 notice from the </p><p>Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National </p><p>Housing.  The notice, addressed to urban mayors, requested </p><p>that mayors provide meeting schedules and minutes to their </p><p>respective government-appointed district administrators (DA) </p><p>so that DAs could attend their meetings.  The notice also </p><p>reminds mayors that the Ministry of Local Government is </p><p>mandated by the Urban Councils Act to monitor and supervise </p><p>the affairs of local authorities in Zimbabwe.  UCAZ members </p><p>were adamantly against the order and delivered a response to </p><p>the Ministry of Local Government refusing to comply. </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>8. (C) These physical and verbal attacks, and moves to </p><p>supersede mayors with government appointments and new </p><p>authority structures, illustrate a GOZ strategy to reassert </p><p>control in urban constituencies that fell to the MDC in </p><p>recent elections.  The MDC\'s five mayors provide the only </p><p>opportunity for the opposition party to demonstrate that it </p><p>can govern well, and the GOZ appears increasingly determined </p><p>to ensure that does not happen.  This is a risky strategy for </p><p>the GOZ, however, as three of the MDC\'s five mayors--those in </p><p>Harare, Bulawayo, and Chitungwiza--were elected by </p><p>overwhelming margins and their constituents are growing </p><p>angrier and more desperate by the day.  Minister Chombo is </p><p>legally entitled to remove a mayor from office, but we </p><p>suspect such a move would be held in abeyance as a last </p><p>resort.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
