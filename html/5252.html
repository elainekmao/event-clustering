<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000175 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, SOCI, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  Central Committee on minorities, religious, land </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A.  FBIS SEP20030122000013  B. Hanoi 0155 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  The second session of the 7th plenum of </p><p>the Communist Party of Vietnam\'s (CPV) 9th Central Committee </p><p>(CC) apparently focused on key human rights issues of </p><p>national solidarity, treatment of ethnic minorities, </p><p>implementation of religious policy, and land use.  The CC as </p><p>well as CPV General Secretary Nong Duc Manh explicitly </p><p>admitted failures in implementation of official policies and </p><p>incompetent or ill-trained cadres, especially at the </p><p>grassroots level and notably in mountainous areas.  The </p><p>plenum\'s solutions for these problems appear mainly to </p><p>include strengthening CPV and State control and </p><p>institutions, with an emphasis on heightening "patriotic" </p><p>activities and guarding against "enemy" plots. </p><p>Unfortunately, the CPV\'s new efforts may exacerbate rather </p><p>than alleviate long-standing problems, and non-recognized </p><p>religious activities and activists may face even tougher </p><p>treatment and scrutiny.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  During an unusual "second phase" meeting of the 9th </p><p>CC 7th plenum January 13-21, the main themes included </p><p>strengthening national solidarity, improving work related to </p><p>ethnic minorities, handling religious affairs better, and </p><p>dealing more successfully with land issues, according to </p><p>media reports (ref a).  (Note:  Embassy requested a post- </p><p>plenum read-out from the CPV on January 15, but is unlikely </p><p>to get an appointment until after the Tet holidays.  Nodel </p><p>Pitts is scheduled to meet with the Government Committee on </p><p>Religious Affairs on January 24 and may learn more about any </p><p>updated religious policy; Deputy Prime Minister Vu Khoan </p><p>reportedly briefed the CRA about the CC\'s resolution on </p><p>religion on January 21, which the press described as the </p><p>CPV\'s "first-ever."  Embassy has also requested a meeting </p><p>with the CRA to discuss its January 22-23 national </p><p>conference covering its work in 2002/2003.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In concluding remarks, CPV GS Manh admitted serious </p><p>problems, including discrimination, lack of mutual trust, </p><p>and the low quality of cadres.  The Plenum\'s communiqu </p><p>spoke at even greater length about such issues, noting that </p><p>"in some places" -- especially minority and mountainous </p><p>areas -- cadres and party members lacked "solidarity" and, </p><p>in some cases, "took advantage of their positions or were </p><p>corrupt" in the management and use of land.  Manh warned </p><p>that the twin issues of minorities and religion were </p><p>"strategic" and that it was time to "pay attention with all </p><p>our efforts" to these issues. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  While reaffirming the right of religious belief or </p><p>non-belief, both Manh and the communiqu emphasized "legal </p><p>activities" and denounced use of "ethnic nationality, belief </p><p>[or] religion" for "illegal activities" aimed at "dividing </p><p>the people" or hurting "national security."  The communiqu </p><p>noted that "in some places, especially in areas of ethnic </p><p>minorities, some believers had used religious belief to </p><p>conduct activities of opposition."  The communiqu called </p><p>for the development of a "spirit of patriotism" among </p><p>religious believers to "defeat the plots of enemy forces </p><p>using religion and ethnic nationality to destroy solidarity </p><p>or oppose the system."   "Foreign relations" related to </p><p>religion should be "coordinated with the foreign policy of </p><p>the Party and State." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The plenum\'s solution for ethnic minority problems </p><p>included "improving the quality of the political system" at </p><p>the grassroots level and ensuring that "hot spots" did not </p><p>emerge in minority and mountainous areas, as well as </p><p>increased and improved use of radio and television programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Manh noted that the plenum\'s deliberations on land </p><p>policy and use will be an "important base" when the National </p><p>Assembly looks at a new Law on Land sometime in 2003.  The </p><p>plenum admitted that land issues were "very complicated" in </p><p>some places, often for historical reasons, and called for </p><p>"strengthening the leadership of the Party" and promoting </p><p>the role of the CPV and Vietnam Fatherland Front to bring </p><p>order to the land problem, along with clarifications </p><p>regarding the "responsibilities . . . and management of the </p><p>State" regarding land. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The plenum agreed to remove Minister of Public </p><p>Security Le Hong Anh as head of the CC\'s Inspection </p><p>Commission, to be replaced by CC member and chairman of the </p><p>CC\'s Commission for Internal Security Nguyen Van Chi, who </p><p>simultaneously entered the CC\'s Secretariat.  (Note:  this </p><p>probably was not indicative of any censure against Anh, who </p><p>retains his Politburo seat.  This re-allocation allows him </p><p>to concentrate on the MPS portfolio he assumed last summer. </p><p>End note)  In a probable indication of the severity of </p><p>upcoming "Nam Cam mafia" case, the plenum formally </p><p>"disciplined" Politburo member (and chief of the CC\'s </p><p>Economic Commission) Truong Tan Sang for "failing to meet </p><p>his responsibilities in investigating and preventing the </p><p>criminal activities of Truong Van Cam," as well as problems </p><p>in "work with cadres," while serving as Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>Party secretary.  Sang apparently did not lose either his </p><p>Politburo seat or his committee chairmanship, however. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Comment:  Embassy will continue to press for a </p><p>fuller read-out in the weeks ahead regarding what must have </p><p>been lively discussions among CC members on these admittedly </p><p>sensitive and often inter-related issues.  The CC\'s focus </p><p>was, at least, squarely on some of the key human rights </p><p>challenges facing the CPV and GVN nowadays, notably in the </p><p>Central Highlands but also in other areas.  Calls to improve </p><p>the quality and education of cadres at the grassroots levels </p><p>are welcome, if not new.  However, the bottom-line CPV </p><p>determination, in line with earlier plenum resolutions on </p><p>strengthening party leadership at all levels under the </p><p>rubric of "grassroots democracy," likely is to continue to </p><p>reassert greater CPV control and oversight.  At the same </p><p>time, the CPV explicitly encouraged well-meaning (if not </p><p>always well implemented) programs to reduce poverty, improve </p><p>educational opportunities, promote economic development, and </p><p>accept religious activities by recognized religious groups. </p><p>The sharp references to "enemy forces" using religion and </p><p>ethnic nationality for nefarious purposes is a distinct </p><p>reminder that the CPV and GVN likely have diminishing </p><p>patience toward activities by locals or foreigners that even </p><p>hint at separatism or promotion of non-recognized religious </p><p>groupings, however.  House churches, evangelists, and Dega </p><p>nationalists may face even more vigilant scrutiny and </p><p>perhaps harsher treatment by local CPV and GVN authorities </p><p>in the wake of this plenum.  Embassy and ConGen will watch </p><p>for any indications of any such campaign, which could easily </p><p>exacerbate instead of alleviate tensions in minority areas. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
