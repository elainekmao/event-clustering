(U) On January 16, Vietnam announced the launch of the </p><p>Vietnam Country Gateway Project (VNCG).  Sponsored by the </p><p>World Bank as part of the Global Information Technology </p><p>Development Program (InfoDev), the GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GATEWAY is a system that seeks to create an "open" </p><p>environment based on access to databases throughout the </p><p>world from one central E-hub in order to foster economic </p><p>development.  The Vietnam Country Gateway will make </p><p>information and knowledge available for domestic and </p><p>international users.  Furthermore, it will promote </p><p>information technology applications in order to achieve </p><p>further economic and social development. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) VNCG will focus on extending and improving internet </p><p>services to promote the dissemination of quality </p><p>information, catalyze the development of the country\'s </p><p>Internet economy, and provide support to government and </p><p>private sector initiatives for economic development and </p><p>alleviation of poverty throughout Vietnam.  VNCG\'s main </p><p>objective is to broaden the capacity for providing Internet </p><p>services to remote and rural areas of the country. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U) The dissemination and exchange of information is </p><p>crucial in order to achieve Vietnam\'s stated goal of </p><p>integrating into the region and the world.  Because of the </p><p>potential impact of Internet technology on all socio- </p><p>economic arenas and the project\'s community service nature, </p><p>support of Government Ministries and agencies, local </p><p>authorities, international organizations and funding </p><p>institutions is essential.  At this point the project seems </p><p>to have solid support from all concerned. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) As the recipient of a 40,000 USD grant from the </p><p>World Bank for the planning stage (an additional USD 600,000 </p><p>implementation grant from the World Bank is expected to </p><p>follow), Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications (VNPT) will </p><p>provide guidance for development strategy, telecommunication </p><p>infrastructure, and related policy issues.  Vietnam Data </p><p>Communication (VDC) will implement the program, with the </p><p>Director and Deputy Director of VDC occupying the posts of </p><p>project coordinator and project manager respectively (see </p><p>ref B for an explanation of Vietnam\'s telecom sector). </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) Comment: Speakers at the launch often referred to </p><p>"world-wide internet access" and the "global database of </p><p>knowledge."  The question will be to what extent the GVN </p><p>will filter and restrict this access, especially given </p><p>recent regulations requiring registration of web sites (for </p><p>further discussion of this issue, see ref A). This ambitious </p><p>project has the potential to dramatically change the lives </p><p>of Vietnam\'s rural population, which is extremely isolated. </p><p>However, Vietnam\'s aspiration for such socio-economic </p><p>development directly conflicts with the Government\'s desire </p><p>to control the flow of information through website </p><p>registration requirements, Internet filters, and censorship </p><p>of the local media.  Therefore, this project\'s success will </p><p>ultimately depend upon the willingness of the Government to </p><p>allow unfettered access to the Internet. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
