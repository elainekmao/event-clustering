HE </p><p>CHAIRS THE INFLUENTIAL NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL, AND APPOINTS THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO LEADS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S PARTY, THE CROATIAN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ), HOLDS THE MAJORITY OF SEATS IN </p><p>BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.  A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS NAMED IN </p><p>NOVEMBER AFTER MULTI-PARTY ELECTIONS WERE HELD FOR THE </p><p>LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT.  GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE WEAKENS </p><p>THE NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY.  THE ENORMOUS </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY, THE MILITARY </p><p>OCCUPATION OF LARGE SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE OF ONE POLITICAL PARTY TEND TO </p><p>STIFLE THE EXPRESSION OF DIVERSE VIEWS.  THE HDZ HAS RULED </p><p>CROATIA SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1991 AND THE PARTY HAS </p><p>SOUGHT TO ENTRENCH ITS AUTHORITY IN THE LEGISLATURE AND </p><p>THE JUDICIARY, AND AT THE COUNTY AND MUNICIPALITY LEVELS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA MILITARILY TOOK BACK CONTROL OF THE TERRITORY </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR FOUR YEARS BY BREAKAWAY SERBS. </p><p>ONLY THE FORMER SECTOR EAST REMAINS OUTSIDE EFFECTIVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTROL, ALTHOUGH BOTH PARTIES SIGNED AN </p><p>AGREEMENT IN MID-NOVEMBER TO BRING THIS AREA UNDER </p><p>COMPLETE GOVERNMENT CONTROL AFTER A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF </p><p>ONE TO TWO YEARS.  IN MARCH, THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTIVE </p><p>FORCE (UNPROFOR) MANDATE WAS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE </p><p>MONITORING OF THE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS OF CROATIA, AND AN </p><p>INCREASED PRESENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS IN THE UN </p><p>PROTECTED AREAS.

THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED MILITARY OFFENSIVES ON THREE REBEL </p><p>SERB-HELD ZONES IN MAY AND AUGUST AND RECOVERED THE </p><p>TERRITORY.  UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED </p><p>EIGHTY THOUSAND SERB REFUGEES FLED INTO SERB-CONTROLLED </p><p>BOSNIA AND SERBIA/MONTENEGRO DURING THE TWO CAMPAIGNS. </p><p>THE MOST FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THE PAST </p><p>YEAR IN CROATIA WERE COMMITTED DURING AND AFTER THESE </p><p>OPERATIONS.  ABUSES ALSO CONTINUED IN REBEL SERB-HELD </p><p>AREAS.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPELLED CROAT AND MUSLIM </p><p>REFUGEES CONTINUED TO ARRIVE FROM SERBIA AND BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR OVERSEES THE POLICE WHILE THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OVERSEES THE ARMED FORCES (HV).  THE </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY, BUT IN TIMES OF DISORDER, E.G. DURING AND AFTER </p><p>THE MAY AND AUGUST OFFENSIVES, THE GOVERNMENT MAY CALL ON </p><p>THE ARMY TO PROVIDE SECURITY.  BOTH THE POLICE AND ARMY </p><p>ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTERNAL SECURITY.  CIVILIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES GENERALLY MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL SECURITY FORCES.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL PERSONNEL </p><p>FROM EACH SERVICE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT ABUSES </p><p>COMMITTED IN THE RECLAIMED TERRITORIES.  CIVIL POLICE HAVE </p><p>NO AUTHORITY OVER MILITARY POLICE OR OVER UNIFORMED </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL.  IN SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS, THE WELL- </p><p>ARMED POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES CONTINUED THEIR PATTERN </p><p>OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST BOTH NON-SERBS AND SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA\'S ECONOMY IS SLOWLY CONVERTING FROM CENTRALIZED </p><p>SELF-MANAGEMENT TO A MARKET-BASED, PRIVATE FREE ENTERPRISE </p><p>SYSTEM.

FAMILY-OWNED SMALL ENTERPRISES </p><p>ARE MULTIPLYING.  THE STABILIZATION PROGRAM KEPT INFLATION </p><p>LOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THE CONTINUED OCCUPATION OF THE </p><p>EASTERN AREA BY REBEL SERBS, THE MASSIVE REFUGEE PROBLEM, </p><p>AND THE TWO MILITARY OFFENSIVES ALL LIMITED ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY.  THE SLOW MARKET TRANSITION AND THE WAR ECONOMY </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO POLARIZING ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN SOCIETY. </p><p>IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE WORLD BANK, THE IMF AND THE </p><p>EBRD HAVE BEGUN PROGRAMS IN CROATIA WHICH WILL ASSIST IN </p><p>REBUILDING THE ECONOMY AND BRING IN FOREIGN INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT GENERALLY RESPECTED THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ITS </p><p>ETHNIC CROAT CITIZENS.  HOWEVER, PROFOUND PROBLEMS AND </p><p>NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS EXISTED.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD WORSENED WITH RESPECT TO MINORITY GROUPS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY ETHNIC SERBS.  THE BULK OF VIOLENT ABUSES </p><p>OCCURRED IN THE RECONQUERED REGIONS, AFTER THE MILITARY </p><p>AND THE POLICE OPERATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO </p><p>ESTABLISH ADEQUATE CIVIL AUTHORITY TO CONTROL VENGEFUL </p><p>RENEGADE ARSONISTS, LOOTERS, AND MURDERERS WHO OPERATED </p><p>WITH IMPUNITY IN THE RECLAIMED AREAS MONTHS AFTER THE </p><p>OFFENSIVES HAD ENDED.

THE SECURITY FORCES TURNED A </p><p>BLIND EYE TO, COOPERATED IN, OR EVEN COMMITTED MANY OF THE </p><p>ABUSES IN THE RECLAIMED AREAS.

THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY </p><p>SUSPENDED KEY PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL MINORITIES LAW IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND STILL HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THE PROVISIONAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS COURT AS MANDATED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN </p><p>1992.  SPECIFIC ABUSES COMMITTED INCLUDED ETHNIC-BASED </p><p>KILLINGS, ARBITRARY DETENTION AND TORTURE, RESTRICTIONS OF </p><p>MOVEMENT AND ON REPATRIATION, MASS DESTRUCTION AND </p><p>CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY, DENIAL OF FAIR AND EXPEDITIOUS </p><p>TRIALS, AND INFRINGEMENTS ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE </p><p>PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN </p><p>AREAS UNDER REBEL SERB CONTROL.  THE POLICE AND MILITARY </p><p>FORCES CONTINUED TO USE VIOLENCE, MURDER, INTIMIDATION, </p><p>AND DISPLACEMENT AGAINST MINORITIES TO SETTLE INCOMING </p><p>SERB REFUGEES AND ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF ETHNIC CLEANSING. </p><p>SUCH CONDITIONS PREVAILED EVEN AFTER THE LOSS OF THREE </p><p>REGIONS TO GOVERNMENT FORCES.  IN MAY, PROVOKED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTACK ON THE FORMER SECTOR WEST, "REPUBLIC OF </p><p>SERBIAN KRAJINA (RSK) PRESIDENT" MARTIC ORDERED THE </p><p>BOMBING OF CIVILIAN CENTERS IN FREE CROATIA, INCLUDING </p><p>ZAGREB.  AT LEAST SIX CIVILIANS DIED IN THESE INCIDENTS. </p><p>RESIDENTS OF THE "RSK" WERE SUBJECT TO A CONTROLLED PARA- </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM OPERATING WITHOUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, </p><p>ASSEMBLY, PRESS, RELIGION, MOVEMENT, OR THE RIGHT TO </p><p>CHANGE THEIR GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>SECTION 1.

POLITICAL AND OTHER EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLING </p><p> </p><p>UNCRO OFFICIALS REGISTERED 300-500 REPORTS OF KILLINGS IN </p><p>RECLAIMED PARTS OF CROATIA.  MOST WERE ETHNICALLY </p><p>MOTIVATED, AND OCCURRED LONG AFTER THE MILITARY OFFENSIVES </p><p>WERE OVER.  ONLY IN THE MOST PUBLIC CASES WERE EFFECTIVE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT AND PERPETRATORS PUNISHED, </p><p>MOSTLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE FROM INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS.  AMONG THOSE </p><p>IMPLICATED IN THE KILLINGS WERE CIVILIANS, CIVIL POLICE </p><p>AND ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE NON-PROFESSIONAL "HOME GUARD" BRIGADES.  TWO INCIDENTS </p><p>NOTE PARTICULAR MENTION.  THE CORPSES OF SEVEN ELDERLY </p><p>CIVILIANS WERE FOUND IN LATE AUGUST SHOT, SLAUGHTERED, AND </p><p>BURNED IN THE VILLAGE OF GRUBORI.  THE OLDEST VICTIM WAS </p><p>90 YEARS OLD.  WITNESSES SAW UNIFORMED SPECIAL POLICE AND </p><p>HV AT THE SCENE.  AT FIRST, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CLAIMED </p><p>THE CIVILIANS WERE CAUGHT IN A CLASH BETWEEN HV AND ENEMY </p><p>TROOPS.  MONTHS LATER, A FEW CROATS WERE ARRESTED FOR THE </p><p>MURDER OF THESE CIVILIANS AND WERE STILL UNDER </p><p>INVESTIGATION AT THE END OF THE YEAR.  IN A SECOND </p><p>INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 28, IN THE VILLAGE OF VARIVODE, </p><p>UNCRO MONITORS FOUND THE BODIES OF NINE ELDERLY SERBS, </p><p>SHOT TO DEATH.  13 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED FOR THE </p><p>INCIDENT.  AT THE END OF THE YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED </p><p>IT HAD INVESTIGATED 26 MURDERS, AND RESOLVED 15 CASES, </p><p>CHARGING A TOTAL OF 20 INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THREE </p><p>SOLDIERS AND ONE POLICEMAN. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  05178  02 OF 15  181358Z </p><p>SERBS IN THE OCCUPIED AREAS ALSO COMMITTED ETHNICALLY </p><p>MOTIVATED KILLINGS WITHIN THE SECTORS AND ALONG THE </p><p>CONFRONTATION LINE, WITH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF </p><p>VICTIMS BEING NON-SERBS.  IN JUNE, THREE CROAT GARBAGE </p><p>COLLECTORS WERE KIDNAPPED BY EAST SLAVONIAN SERBS DURING A </p><p>REGULAR RUN TO THE OSIJEK CITY DUMP INSIDE THE SEPARATION </p><p>ZONE.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE RELEASED, BUT SERB AUTHORITIES </p><p>IN ERDUT EVENTUALLY ADMITTED THAT THE THIRD, FRANJO IVOS, </p><p>WAS KILLED.  NO SUSPECT WAS EVER APPREHENDED, AND LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES INSIST THAT THE BODY WAS LOST.  IN OCTOBER, </p><p>SERB SNIPERS FROM THIS SECTOR KILLED TWO CROATS IN </p><p>BELISCE.  REBEL SERBS TARGETED UN PERSONNEL ALSO.  A </p><p>KENYAN UNCRO SOLDIER WAS SHOT DEAD IN MAY IN SECTOR SOUTH. </p><p>IN JANUARY IN SECTOR EAST, ONE RUSSIAN BATTALION SOLDIER </p><p>AND THREE LOCAL SERBS WERE SHOT UNDER UNCLEAR </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, POSSIBLY INVOLVING BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY. </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER, 4 DANISH UN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED NEAR DVOR </p><p>AS BOSNIAN SERBS DELIBERATELY TARGETED A UN OBSERVATION </p><p>POST ACROSS THE UNA RIVER IN CROATIA.  HV UNITS HAD </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO CROSS THE RIVER, AND FIRE WAS EXCHANGED </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

DISAPPEARANCE </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE FEW NEW CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES REPORTED.  AT </p><p>YEAR\'S END, THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED MORE THAN 2,800 CASES </p><p>OF MISSING PERSONS STILL UNRESOLVED FROM THE 1991-1992 </p><p>WAR.  SOME PROGRESS WAS MADE IN REMOVING NAMES FROM THE </p><p>LIST OF THE MISSING AS A RESULT OF PRISONER AND BODY </p><p>EXCHANGES, AND IDENTIFICATIONS MADE OF CORPSES EXHUMED IN </p><p>THE RECLAIMED AREAS.

THE COURTS HAD </p><p>NEITHER RELEASED NOR CHARGED ANY OF THEM WITH A CRIME BY </p><p>THE END OF THE YEAR.

THE POLICE THEN </p><p>HAVE 24 HOURS IN WHICH TO JUSTIFY THEIR DECISION BEFORE </p><p>THE LOCAL INTERROGATING MAGISTRATE. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER ARREST, THE LAW STATES PERSONS MUST BE GIVEN ACCESS </p><p>TO AN ATTORNEY OF THEIR CHOICE WITHIN 24 HOURS; IF THEY </p><p>HAVE NO ATTORNEY, AND ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME FOR WHICH </p><p>THE SENTENCE IS OVER TEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT OR MORE, THE </p><p>INTERROGATING MAGISTRATE WILL APPOINT ONE FROM A LIST OF </p><p>PUBLIC DEFENDERS.  IF THE SENTENCE IS UNDER 10 YEARS, THE </p><p>DETAINEE CAN REQUEST COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL IF HE SO </p><p>CHOOSES.  THE COURT WILL APPOINT COUNSEL AFTER CHARGES ARE </p><p>LEVIED FOR THE TRIAL.  THE INTERROGATING JUDGE MUST, </p><p>WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE ARREST, DECIDE WHETHER SUFFICIENT </p><p>CAUSE EXISTS TO HOLD THE ARRESTEE IN CUSTODY PENDING </p><p>FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR POSTING BAIL AFTER CHARGES </p><p>ARE BROUGHT, BUT THE PRACTICE IS NOT COMMON.

THERE WERE, HOWEVER, INCONSISTENCIES AMONG </p><p>POLLING PLACES, MOST OF WHICH PROBABLY RESULTED FROM A </p><p>LACK OF TRAINING FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS.  PROBLEMS WHICH </p><p>APPEARED DURING VOTING APPEAR TO HAVE CURTAILED THE RIGHTS </p><p>OF SOME MINORITY VOTERS.

IN THE CURRENT TRANSITION TO PRIVATIZATION </p><p>AND A FREE MARKET ECONOMY, THE UNIONS ARE UNDER PRESSURE </p><p>DUE TO JOB LOSSES, GENERAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN A WEAKENED </p><p>ECONOMY, AND THEIR OWN STRUGGLE TO BECOME GENUINE FREE </p><p>TRADE UNIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE LABOR CODE, WHICH GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 1996, </p><p>DEALS DIRECTLY WITH ANTIUNION DISCRIMINATION ISSUES. </p><p>UNIONS NOW CAN CHALLENGE FIRINGS IN COURT, AND THE NEW </p><p>LABOR CODE DID AWAY WITH PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH ILLNESS </p><p>HAD BEEN A VALID REASON FOR EMPLOYERS TO FIRE WORKERS.
