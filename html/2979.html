<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000977 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoists Attack Orphan School </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) Kathmandu 933, B) Kathmandu 828 </p><p> </p><p>Bomb at Foreign-Funded Boarding School </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Insurgents set off a bomb at a well-known INGO- </p><p>funded orphanage and boarding school in Surkhet district </p><p>400 km west of Kathmandu late on May 17.  No one was </p><p>injured in the blast, caused by a pressure cooker bomb </p><p>placed in the window of the principal\'s residence.  The </p><p>event garnered wide press coverage throughout the country </p><p>May 19 and 20, and the Maoists were roundly criticized for </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>No Recent Threat Preceded Attack </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Chief District Officer (CDO) for Surkhet </p><p>confirmed press reports of the incident.  The CDO added </p><p>that although the school had received threats from the </p><p>Maoists last year, there had been none made recently. </p><p>[Note:  A press report quotes the school\'s principal </p><p>saying the Maoists had never threatened his school.  End </p><p>Note.]  He also noted that all other boarding schools in </p><p>Surkhet had been closed since last year due to the threat </p><p>of Maoist violence.  [Comment:  Maoist dogma is critical </p><p>of and threatening to private schools and private schools </p><p>have been attacked in the past.  Recently a Maoist bomb </p><p>exploded next to an orphanage in Kathmandu (Ref B).  End </p><p>Comment.] </p><p> </p><p>School for Orphans, Disadvantaged Kids </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) About 500 children attend the school, an SOS </p><p>Children\'s Village funded by the Hermann Gmeiner </p><p>Foundation in Innsbruck, Austria.  The SOS Children\'s </p><p>Villages are world famous for their work with orphans and </p><p>other disadvantaged children at facilities around the </p><p>world.  Of the 500 pupils, 145 are orphans who board at </p><p>the school.  Nearly all the rest are day students from </p><p>disadvantaged families who attend tuition-free.  The </p><p>school has been closed until further notice due to the </p><p>attack. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The National Director for SOS Nepal left the </p><p>capital for Surkhet May 18 to inspect the damage.  He told </p><p>the principal of an SOS school in Kathmandu that he was </p><p>trying to console the children, who were still panicked. </p><p>The bomb blast rendered dormitories unusable, so students </p><p>had to double up at night.  No classrooms were damaged. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The attack is a new low for the Maoists.  Coming </p><p>almost a week after Maoists raided a university in nearby </p><p>Dang district (Ref A), the attack on SOS suggests that the </p><p>Maoist movement has finally descended to primitive </p><p>anarchism.  Attacks on orphans and disadvantaged children </p><p>have not won the Maoists any friends, and in fact have </p><p>helped sway public opinion against them. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
