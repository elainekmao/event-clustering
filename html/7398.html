(SBU) Summary and comment: In conversations with </p><p>the Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Filipino Labor </p><p>Attaches, Econoff was repeatedly told that the vast </p><p>majority of labor disputes in the UAE between foreign </p><p>nationals and Emirati businesses and institutions are </p><p>generally handled on an informal level with the </p><p>assistance of the various embassies.  When informal </p><p>processes fail, the embassies guide workers to formal </p><p>government channels for dispute resolution.  According </p><p>to the Labor Attaches, existing formal and informal </p><p>mechanisms result in most labor disputes involving </p><p>foreign nationals in the UAE being settled amicably. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary and comment (con\'t):  The Labor </p><p>Attaches have a vested interest in painting a rosy </p><p>scenario to make themselves look good. Their anecdotes </p><p>of diligent efforts and successes on behalf of their </p><p>clients reflect admirably on themselves. All of these </p><p>embassies also desire to promote a continuing inflow </p><p>of laborers from their native lands, to help ease </p><p>unemployment back home, and to generate needed foreign </p><p>exchange. Thus they have a tendency to emphasize the </p><p>good and minimize the bad in regards to labor </p><p>disputes.  While, the administrative and legal </p><p>processes may be relatively fair, they are also </p><p>extremely time-consuming and difficult.  Most workers </p><p>have neither the time, nor patience for such </p><p>protracted proceedings. Nonetheless, even with these </p><p>caveats, the consistency of the Labor Attaches\' upbeat </p><p>assessments of the dispute resolution processes </p><p>demonstrates that the informal grievance system does </p><p>appear to work relatively well -- when a matter is </p><p>brought to the attention of the Labor Attaches. The </p><p>UAEG is also in the process of enacting legislation </p><p>that will institutionalize workers\' rights and bring </p><p>the formal system closer in line to international </p><p>standards. (See refs A-D).  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF LABOR IN THE UAE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The UAE economy is highly dependent on foreign </p><p>skilled and unskilled workers.  More than 80 percent </p><p>of the estimated population of 3.9 million is </p><p>expatriate, and approximately 63 percent of the total </p><p>population is non-Arab Asian.  Only about 10 percent </p><p>of the workforce is Emirati, a number that decreases </p><p>to only 2 percent in the private sector. The vast </p><p>majority of unskilled laborers in the UAE come from </p><p>five countries: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka </p><p>and the Philippines. </p><p> </p><p>INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Laborers most commonly complained of poor </p><p>working conditions and not receiving wages, and </p><p>expatriate domestic servants complained of abuse. </p><p>Workers are protected by a comprehensive UAE Labor Law </p><p>that regulates all facets of labor relations.  (Note: </p><p>This law does not cover domestic servants. Laborers do </p><p>not technically have the right to strike, but work </p><p>stoppages/strikes are not uncommon in the UAE and the </p><p>federal government is in the process of formalizing </p><p>legislation to institutionalize unions. End note.)  In </p><p>January 2003, a new law was enacted requiring sponsors </p><p>and domestic servants to adhere to a contract system, </p><p>specifying the rights and duties of each party to the </p><p>other.  Under this legislation, sponsors will be under </p><p>the same obligations as other employers, and domestic </p><p>servants will have the right to complain to the Labour </p><p>Disputes Section of the Ministry of Labour. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) According to the Labor Attaches, workplace </p><p>disputes are generally resolved directly between the </p><p>employee and the employer. (Note: This is also the </p><p>first recommended course of action in the UAE Labor </p><p>Law. End Note.)  If troubles persist, laborers will </p><p>ask their embassy for assistance.  (Note: Due to the </p><p>large Filipino population in the UAE, the Philippines </p><p>Embassy and Consulate receive 200-250 calls or walk- </p><p>ins per week.  The Sri Lankans reported about 150 </p><p>cases weekly, the Bangladeshis about 100/weekly and </p><p>the Indians could not provide an estimate.  End note.) </p><p>Once the worker reports an incident, the Labor Attache </p><p>contacts the employer on behalf of the worker and </p><p>tries to resolve the situation amicably.  In a recent </p><p>example, food workers at the UAE University in Al Ain </p><p>complained to the Philippines Embassy that they had </p><p>not been paid.  The Labor Attache in turn contacted </p><p>university officials and learned the federal </p><p>government had not properly disbursed the funds for </p><p>salaries. She then called the appropriate individuals </p><p>in the government and resolved the situation.  The </p><p>Labor Attache stated that this anecdote was typical of </p><p>how labor disputes are traditionally handled in the </p><p>UAE. </p><p> </p><p>FORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) When informal methods fail to resolve labor </p><p>problems, the UAE Labor Law does provide for </p><p>administrative and legal relief. Generally, a case is </p><p>first filed with the Labor Disputes Section of the </p><p>Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and then, as a </p><p>last resort, brought before the civil courts. (Note: </p><p>Though the Philippines Embassy gets a large number of </p><p>calls and walk-ins, the Labor Attache estimated that </p><p>there are only about 20 cases presently in the legal </p><p>system). Outside of the Philippines Embassy, none of </p><p>the Labor Attaches had an accurate count of the cases </p><p>before the administrative and legal systems.  They all </p><p>agreed, however, that even though the process took </p><p>some time, it was generally fair and the court system </p><p>in particular was extremely competent. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
