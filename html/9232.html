<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EU, MARR, NL, PREL, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH PM BALKENDE OUTLINES AGENDA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. CLIFFORD SOBEL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On June 30, Amb Sobel and Dutch PM Jan Peter Balkende </p><p>discussed their objectives. The Prime Minister listed three </p><p>issues on which he personally wanted to lead his new </p><p>government:  values, innovation, and the 2004 EU presidency. </p><p>In the Fall, the PM will begin traveling to capitals to </p><p>prepare the Dutch presidency.  Preliminarily, the Dutch have </p><p>cited several political issues they expect to dominate their </p><p>presidency, including relations with new members, ESDP </p><p>(especially since they will follow the Irish), the </p><p>transatlantic relationship, and a decision on whether to open </p><p>negotiations with Turkey.  "Values" is an important issue to </p><p>this Christian-Democrat Prime Minister and one that resonated </p><p>in his election.  Amb Sobel pointed out the similarity of </p><p>Prime Minister Balkenende\'s vision with that of President </p><p>Bush\'s and offered to arrange briefings on the President\'s </p><p>faith based initiatives.  Similarly, Amb Sobel noted the </p><p>symmetry between the prime minister\'s innovation council and </p><p>ideas current in the USG and society. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Sobel told the Prime Minister of the </p><p>embassy\'s ambitious agenda, ranging from innovation and the </p><p>transatlantic business dialogue to security, </p><p>counter-terrorism and HIV.  He discussed a trade mission to </p><p>Silicon Valley aimed at developing trade and investment </p><p>between our two countries, a dialogue among CEOs on trade in </p><p>financial services, additional steps we can take to develop </p><p>the Container Security project at the port of Rotterdam, his </p><p>vision for joint projects to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa, the </p><p>necessity of the Netherlands making progress on </p><p>counter-narcotics, steps we can take to expand exchange </p><p>programs between the U.S. and The Netherlands, and the </p><p>importance of the Dutch keeping their commitments to NATO, </p><p>including their ability to deploy and sustain forces even in </p><p>the face of severe budget cuts. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
