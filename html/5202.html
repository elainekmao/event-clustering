<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PORTILLO SPEECH TURNED FRG CAMPAIGN RALLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The FRG used the occasion of President </p><p>Portillo\'s January 14 state of the union speech to bus in to </p><p>the capital thousands of former self defense committee </p><p>patrollers (ex-PACs).  After delivering his annual review of </p><p>his government\'s accomplishments and priorities in Congress, </p><p>Portillo and FRG leader Rios Montt addressed the crowds, who </p><p>have been promised compensation for their unpaid service to </p><p>the nation during the 36-year civil conflict.  While the </p><p>substance of the official speech was nothing new, the pro-FRG </p><p>rally marked the first major FRG event of election season, </p><p>and suggested that the FRG is not yet attempting to distance </p><p>itself from Portillo\'s record.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Cup Half Full Speech to Congress </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In an hour-long speech to Congress on January 14, the </p><p>third anniversary of his swearing-in, President Portillo </p><p>emphasized his government\'s accomplishments, including the </p><p>following highlights: </p><p> </p><p>-- New Things:  He cited as accomplishments the creation of </p><p>new government bodies and key legislation to tackle </p><p>persistent problems, including the Commission for </p><p>Transparency and Against Corruption, the National Council for </p><p>Food and Nutrition Security, the Presidential Commission </p><p>Against Discrimination and Racism, the Secretariat for </p><p>Agrarian Issues, laws on Agriculture and Fishing, Urban and </p><p>Rural Development Councils, reforms to the municipal code, </p><p>and decentralization; </p><p> </p><p>-- Statistics:  He also cited the number of free fertilizer </p><p>bags distributed to campesinos, the 47.6% increase in the </p><p>minimum wage for agricultural workers in his term (43.6% for </p><p>non-agricultural workers), financial and monetary reforms, </p><p>macroeconomic stability, and record tax collection (10.58 </p><p>percent of the GNP); </p><p> </p><p>-- Military Restructuring:  He cited troop reductions, </p><p>closure of bases, and phased reduction of the EMP; </p><p> </p><p>-- Free Trade:  He claimed to have promoted free trade and </p><p>pledged to vigorously pursue a CAFTA; </p><p> </p><p>-- Media Attack:  Portillo also made jabs at the news media, </p><p>"in the hands of private interests who do not necessarily </p><p>have national interests at heart;" </p><p> </p><p>--  Corruption:  He claimed to have showed openness to combat </p><p>it despite enduring strong criticism; </p><p> </p><p>--  Failings:  He acknowledged failings on completing some </p><p>Peace Accords commitments, citing "great challenges and </p><p>enormous obstacles;" and (in apparent self-defense) warned </p><p>against "criminalization" politics by substituting calls for </p><p>prosecution in place of debate; </p><p> </p><p>-- Belize:  He said the Belize border dispute is "an open </p><p>wound that we will not reopen further...or close at the cost </p><p>of legitimate national interests." </p><p> </p><p>-- Elections:  He pledged an impartial vote and smooth </p><p>transition to the next administration. </p><p> </p><p>Speeches in the Square </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) After delivering his speech and distributing the </p><p>government official report in Congress, Portillo, accompanied </p><p>by aides and the FRG leadership, addressed a crowd estimated </p><p>at 20,000 (the largest grouping of supporters during his </p><p>tenure) gathered in the city square outside the former </p><p>National Palace.  The crowds were reportedly bused in on a </p><p>fleet of 200 buses, and FRG T-shirts featuring Efrain Rios </p><p>Montt were distributed.  Rosenda Perez, the leader of the </p><p>ex-PAC association of Peten, was in the front row of </p><p>spectators. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Portillo repeated parts of his official speech to the </p><p>crowd, promised not to "defraud" the ex-PACs, warned that </p><p>critics would "invent stories" about the organization of the </p><p>rally, and lauded Rios Montt as a leader.  Haroldo Quej Chen, </p><p>who, as FRG Secretary of Organization and ex-PAC himself, was </p><p>the likely orchestrator of the rally, introduced Rios Montt </p><p>as "a leader any politician fears, a leader any animal fears, </p><p>the greatest leader Guatemala has..."  (Note:  It was Quej </p><p>Chen who cited to the press the high estimate of 30,000 </p><p>attendees.  End Note.).  FRG Congressional bench leader </p><p>Aristides Crespo told the crowd that "they attack us, they </p><p>defame us, they criticize corruption, and we have never </p><p>denied that we have problems, but one must not forget that </p><p>its was the previous government who sold the electric utility </p><p>and telephone company and as a result everyone pays more for </p><p>electricity and the telephone." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) For his part, Rios Montt told the crowd that "as FRG </p><p>Secretary General, I declare that this event is not sponsored </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>by the government or promoting any particular candidate.  It </p><p>is a recognition of the accomplishments up until now of this </p><p>central government and the municipal governments." </p><p> </p><p>Reaction </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Reaction to Portillo\'s official speech and the rally </p><p>were predictable, with media highlighting opposition and </p><p>civil society criticizing Portillo\'s official speech for </p><p>avoiding of key issues (i.e. difficult bilateral relations </p><p>with the U.S., corruption and insecurity), and decrying the </p><p>misuse of official funds and personnel in the staging of a </p><p>highly partisan rally. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The President\'s speech was a stock defense of his </p><p>government\'s (in some cases) legitimate accomplishments and </p><p>was most notable for what it left out:  any mention of us </p><p>(with the exception of the positive reference to CAFTA).  We </p><p>interpret this as a signal of Portillo\'s interest in </p><p>minimizing attention to tensions in the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  More interesting than Portillo\'s official </p><p>speech was the FRG\'s demonstration of its capacity to turn </p><p>out a (paid) crowd, and its confirmation of ex-PAC support at </p><p>its base.  While the official campaign period will not begin </p><p>until May, we can expect more FRG campaign rallies </p><p>thinly-veiled as "pro-government" rallies in the future. </p><p>During this interregnum before the official campaign, the FRG </p><p>is faced with a dilemma.  While explicit in its support for </p><p>Rios Montt as FRG leader and presumed presidential candidate, </p><p>the rally did nothing to distance the party from Portillo and </p><p>his legacy of corruption. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
