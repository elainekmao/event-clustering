<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003165 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO PLEDGES FUNDING FOR </p><p>MPRI </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 219766 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a November 19 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, President of MPRI Gen. (Ret.) Carl Vuono </p><p>and members of the Nigerian defense establishment, </p><p>President Obasanjo pledged 3.5 million dollars to continue </p><p>MPRI operations.  During this meeting and at MPRI\'s In- </p><p>Progress-Review (IPR) on November 18, Nigerian defense </p><p>officials, especially Defense Minister Danjuma, expressed </p><p>strong support for MPRI and stated that the program had </p><p>made important progress in the last year.  The President\'s </p><p>commitment to fund Nigeria\'s portion of MPRI was clear and </p><p>unambiguous and the vote of confidence given to MPRI by the </p><p>MOD and the Service Chiefs was encouraging.  However, given </p><p>Nigeria\'s slow bureaucracy there will be some lag time </p><p>between the President\'s commitment and the actual </p><p>disbursement of the funds.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a November 19 meeting with President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo, Ambassador Jeter, Gen. (Ret.) Carl </p><p>Vuono, Minister of Defense T.Y. Danjuma, Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, Minister of Finance Adamu </p><p>Ciroma, and Presidential Chief of Staff Abdulabi, Gen. </p><p>Vuono gave a detailed account of the MPRI program\'s </p><p>progress in 2002.  Following Gen. Vuono\'s presentation, </p><p>Ambassador delivered the MPRI funding demarche (REF), </p><p>emphasizing that the USG sees the MPRI program to reform </p><p>the Nigerian military as the core of the USG bilateral </p><p>security assistance program.  After a short discussion, </p><p>including a forceful plea by MOD Danjuma for the GON to </p><p>"pay up", President Obasanjo pledged to fund the full 3.5 </p><p>million USD the GON owes to MPRI for FY 2002 operations. </p><p>Canvassing Danjuma and CDS Ogohi, Obasanjo concluded, "The </p><p>value of this program (MPRI) is no longer in doubt." </p><p>Minister of Finance Ciroma indicated that the funds for </p><p>MPRI would be made available from the GON\'s "counterpart </p><p>funds account". Ambassador Jeter noted that settling the </p><p>arrears would be seen in Washington as a very positive </p><p>signal of Nigeria\'s commitment to the reform of and </p><p>reprofessionalization of its defense establishment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The first hint that funding for MPRI might be </p><p>available came during a conversation between Minister of </p><p>State for Defense (Army) Batagarawa and Ambassador on </p><p>November 15.  After lamenting that the Ministry of Defense </p><p>had no money to support the program, Batagarawa commented </p><p>that it might be possible to make use of a special GON </p><p>"counterpart funds" account that, evidently, was </p><p>established to help the GON fund its part of bilateral </p><p>assistance projects.  Heretofore, the fund had only been </p><p>used for civilian aid programs.  Batagarawa said he would </p><p>raise the matter with the Finance Minister.  The sudden </p><p>appearance of GON funds for MPRI seems to indicate that </p><p>Batagarawa\'s plan was well received by the Finance Minister </p><p>and Danjuma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During the meeting, Obasanjo also inquired into the </p><p>status of the "other five OFR battalions".  Obasanjo had </p><p>previously expressed his desire for additional OFR trained </p><p>battalions.  In addition to the lack of funding for new OFR </p><p>battalions, Ambassador noted that proposed funding of </p><p>sustainment programs for the current OFR battalions had </p><p>been held up in the Congress due to concerns over the </p><p>investigation into the October 2001 civilian massacre in </p><p>Benue State. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
