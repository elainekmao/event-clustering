<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006649 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/11/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, ETTC, ENRG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN BEGINS DISCUSSION OF 2003 OIL AND TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (c)  Following internal discussion about the timing of a </p><p>trip to Iraq by Jordanian ministers, the Jordanian trade and </p><p>energy ministers plan to travel to Baghdad next week for </p><p>initial discussions of the 2003 bilateral oil and trade </p><p>protocols.  As in previous years, the two main elements of </p><p>the negotiation are:  1) setting a reference price and amount </p><p>of oil that Iraq will supply Jordan, and 2) agreeing on the </p><p>value of the goods that Jordan will supply to Iraq as </p><p>"payment" for the non-grant portion of the oil. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  The trip follows participation by a 72 company </p><p>Jordanian delegation in the Baghdad trade fair that was led </p><p>by National Economy Minister Samer al-Tawil and Energy </p><p>Minister Muhammad al-Batayneh earlier this month.  According </p><p>to Trade Minister Salah al-Bashir, Batayneh had some informal </p><p>discussions with Iraqi counterparts during the fair that </p><p>"went well."  By going with a bigger technical delegation, </p><p>al-Bashir and Batayneh hope to nail down the details. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Farouq al-Hadidi, the new Secretary General of the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade (Bashir\'s deputy) will lead </p><p>the technical discussions of the trade protocol.  Hadidi, the </p><p>former head of the Export Development Corporation (JEDCO), is </p><p>new to the job and is thought by many in the local business </p><p>community to be close to the traditional industrialists who </p><p>export to Iraq under the protocol.  Nonetheless, we expect </p><p>this year\'s agreement to follow the same general lines as </p><p>last year. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  The headline size of the trade protocol, however, </p><p>will most likely be larger than last year\'s $250 million.  In </p><p>part this will reflect the increase in the market price of </p><p>oil.  In addition, the value of last year\'s trade protocol </p><p>was reduced (from $450 million in 2001) to offset an </p><p>imbalance in goods shipped over oil received that had built </p><p>up in previous years.  Last year\'s agreement, negotiated by </p><p>Samer al-Tawil when he was Secretary General, also contained </p><p>the innovation that goods would only be shipped from Jordan </p><p>to Iraq up to the amount of oil that Jordan actually </p><p>received.  In addition, Jordanian and Iraqi Central Bank </p><p>officials take advantage of the annual meetings to reconcile </p><p>the $2 billion plus debt owed by Iraq to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  Trade Minister al-Bashir told the </p><p>Ambassador that there had been considerable discussion within </p><p>the GOJ as to when we be the right time to make the trip to </p><p>Baghdad.  The decision to proceed as in previous years </p><p>represents a cold calculation by the Jordanians of their </p><p>short-term economic interest in continuing to receive </p><p>cut-rate oil for as long as the Iraqis provide it. </p><p>Nonetheless, as is the case every year, we expect the Iraqis </p><p>to seek to extract some propaganda benefit out of the visit. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
