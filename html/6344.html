<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001054 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 63629 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM E. SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR MULTILATERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS GIANCARLO ARAGONA TOLD DCM ON MARCH 11 THAT THE GOI </p><p>HAD NOT CONSIDERED AN INTERVENTION AND WOULD NOT DEPART FROM </p><p>THE COMMON EU POSITION ON IRAQ AT THE UNSC.  HE THEN RAISED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01054  132009Z </p><p>THE NECESSITY OF REPAIRING DAMAGE TO THE TRANS-ATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP STEMMING FROM DISAGREEMENTS OVER IRAQ.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING MARCH 11 CALL RUNNING A RANGE OF ISSUES (SEE </p><p>SEPTEL), THE DCM ASKED ARAGONA IF ITALY WOULD MAKE AN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL STATEMENT ON THE US/UK/SPANISH IRAQ RESOLUTION AT </p><p>THE UNSC.  ARAGONA INDICATED THE GOI HAD NOT CONSIDERED AN </p><p>INTERVENTION SINCE THE EU, DESPITE ITS DIVISIONS, COULD AT </p><p>LEAST ENUNCIATE THE COMMON PLATFORM ON IRAQ IT HAD AGREED </p><p>FEBRUARY 17.  (NOTE: ARAGONA WAS ONE OF THE KEY DRAFTERS OF </p><p>THAT COMPROMISE DOCUMENT).  HE ASSURED US THAT THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY STATEMENT WOULD NOT STRAY FROM THAT DOCUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ARAGONA SAID THAT THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE AMONG EU </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ON HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S WMD WAS THE LENGTH OF TIME INSPECTORS SHOULD HAVE </p><p>TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK.  THE GOI REALIZES INSPECTIONS CANNOT </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO DRAG ON INDEFINITELY WITHOUT PUTTING THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL AT RISK.  RESPONDING TO </p><p>AN INQUIRY FROM THE DCM QUESTIONING FRANCE\'S OVERALL </p><p>MOTIVATION, ARAGONA REPLIED THE GOF APPEARS TO HAVE AN ISSUE </p><p>WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL CRISES ARE MANAGED, </p><p>AND ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS UNSURE OF THEIR OVERALL THINKING. </p><p>THERE IS A CLEAR DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE OVER </p><p>THE IMMEDIACY OF THE THREAT FROM IRAQ, STEMMING PRIMARILY, IN </p><p>HIS MIND, FROM THE REALITY OF SEPTEMBER 11TH TO AMERICANS, </p><p>THAT POSES A THREAT TO THE TRANS-ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) REFERRING BACK TO HIS RECENT MEETING WITH U/S </p><p>GROSSMAN IN PARIS, ARAGONA SUGGESTED SOME KIND OF JOINT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01054  132009Z </p><p>INITIATIVE GOING FORWARD, A POST IRAQ-CONFLICT UNDERTAKING </p><p>DEMONSTRATING THE WESTERN ALLIANCE HAS TURNED THE PAGE ON ITS </p><p>RECENT DISAGREEMENTS.  WHATEVER THE INITIATIVE, IT SHOULD BE </p><p>GRAND--NOT MERELY SEMINARS OR WORKSHOPS--AND CLEARLY </p><p>DEMONSTRATE A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ARAGONA, THE GOI CONSIDERS CONCRETE MEASURES TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE TRANS-ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP A HIGH PRIORITY </p><p>FOR THE UPCOMING ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY.  ITALY AND THE US </p><p>NEED TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREA IN WHICH TO MAKE </p><p>SUCH A BREAKTHROUGH, PRIOR TO ITALY\'S ASSUMPTION OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01054 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
