<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/28/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EINV, PGOV, NI, OIL </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH SPECIAL ADVISOR </p><p>ON PETROLEUM; PREDICTIONS OF INCREASING ROLE FOR U.S. </p><p>COMPANIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. LAGOS 01290 </p><p>     B. STATE 15002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY: On June 22 Ambassador Jeter, DOE Energy </p><p>Advisor, and Econoff (notetaker) met in Abuja with Special </p><p>Advisor to the President for Petroleum Affairs and Energy, </p><p>Dr. Rilwanu Lukman.  Dr. Lukman indicated that negotiations </p><p>for the ongoing Year 2000 Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) </p><p>would soon be finalized.  A "marginal field" bid round also </p><p>will occur in the near future and the Year 2001 deep water </p><p>round will take place in September.  Dr. Lukman commented on </p><p>the GON\'s desire to broaden participation in the oil sector </p><p>by awarding additional concessions to U.S. firms and by also </p><p>encouraging new entrants.  With regard to President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s promise to increase Nigerian oil exports to the </p><p>U.S., made during the President\'s Official Visit to </p><p>Washington in May, he stated that contracts with </p><p>international oil traders expire in September, and as a </p><p>result the GON is seeking to re-establish direct crude sales </p><p>to the U.S. to fulfill the President\'s promise.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>role in OPEC and GON plans to double oil production and </p><p>reserves by 2010 were also discussed.  Deregulation efforts, </p><p>USG technical assistance, and climate change will be reported </p><p>septels.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PSC NEGOTIATIONS: Ambassador Jeter opened the </p><p>meeting by commenting that the USG was pleased with the level </p><p>of U.S. participation in the Nigerian petroleum sector.  We </p><p>hoped that this participation would expand beyond investments </p><p>in the oil sector and include the natural gas sub-sector. </p><p>However, the Ambassador pointed out, the USG was aware of </p><p>some problems.  One of these is concern over the ongoing Year </p><p>2000 Production Sharing Contract (PSC) negotiations. </p><p>Successful oil block bidders believe that the GON changed the </p><p>rules of the process mid-game, and these negotiations are yet </p><p>to be completed six months later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) PSC BACKGROUND: During the Year 2000 bidding round </p><p>the GON indicated to bidders that the previous 1993 PSC </p><p>arrangement would serve as the model for the Year 2000 round. </p><p>However, when the oil block winners were announced in </p><p>December and PSC negotiations commenced the GON put forth two </p><p>key PSC changes (Ref A).  One change was adjusting the Profit </p><p>Oil Split (POS) ratio to the GON\'s advantage.  The other was </p><p>GON insistence that the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) also be included in a Stability of Law </p><p>Clause.  The Profit Oil Split change meant that the </p><p>companies\' economic analyses, upon which they based their </p><p>bids, changed, and the oil blocks now look less profitable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) PSC BACKGROUND CONT: Jointly including the NNPC in </p><p>the Stability of Law Clause is contradictory, according to </p><p>the oil companies.  The companies point out that this clause </p><p>is meant to protect the investor (oil block operator) from </p><p>future changes in host government legislation.  This is a </p><p>standard industry clause, which allows the operator to </p><p>renegotiate a contract if future legislation negatively </p><p>impacts the profitability of the investment.  To include the </p><p>NNPC within this clause would in fact be protecting a </p><p>government parastatal from government action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) PSC NEGOTIATIONS: Dr. Lukman\'s response was that the </p><p>important aspect of any agreement was the intention behind </p><p>it.  He believes that both sides should have the right to </p><p>modify an agreement without the opposite party feeling </p><p>cheated.  He stated that the GON would not make drastic </p><p>changes to any agreement, and claimed that in past </p><p>negotiations some changes had been to oil companies\' benefit. </p><p>Other changes had been to the GON\'s advantage.  Lukman </p><p>stated that when the 1993 PSC agreements were negotiated, no </p><p>one imagined the oil discoveries that would take place in </p><p>Nigeria\'s offshore.  These major discoveries and the nature </p><p>of deep offshore exploration now required a new type of PSC </p><p>arrangement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) PSC NEGOTIATIONS: Lukman went on to explain that </p><p>with the reintroduction of democracy came the oversight of </p><p>the National Assembly.  He stated that National Assembly </p><p>members have traveled to other oil-producing countries to </p><p>learn more about the industry, and to ensure that the GON was </p><p>receiving its fair share of oil revenues.  As a result, it </p><p>was the National Assembly that pushed for the 70/30 Profit </p><p>Oil Split between the oil companies and the NNPC </p><p>respectively, not his office or the NNPC. Lukman stated "we </p><p>can defend 70/30, but with 80/20, we are in trouble." </p><p>Lukman indicated that in his view this ratio (for the first </p><p>tranche of 350 million barrels of oil produced) was fair and </p><p>a compromise will soon be reached.  On the Stability of Law </p><p>Clause Dr. Lukman stated, "Don\'t worry...we can take care of </p><p>that," implying the GON will drop its demand that the NNPC be </p><p>included. (Comment: Lukman\'s optimism on this issue contrasts </p><p>with the gloom of Chevron\'s MD Ray Wilcox, whom the </p><p>Ambassador saw briefly on June 27.  Wilcox said he had "no </p><p>reason" to think there would be a quick resolution of these </p><p>issues.  Moreover, he characterized the GON\'s attitude toward </p><p>the PSC negotiations as bordering on indifference, with </p><p>little show of flexibility in meeting the oil companies half </p><p>way.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.S. FIRMS: Continuing the </p><p>discussion, Ambassador Jeter commented that Royal Dutch Shell </p><p>still remains a major player in Nigeria, but American firms </p><p>appeared to be taking the lead, especially on new offshore </p><p>exploration.  Dr. Lukman agreed and stated that this was a </p><p>positive development.  The GON believes that such a trend </p><p>provides balance, and Dr. Lukman suggested that in five or </p><p>six years we may see a new configuration of the Nigerian oil </p><p>sector with American firms as the leading producers.  Lukman </p><p>pointed out that the GON was encouraging two significant </p><p>American investments in the gas sector, an ExxonMobil-led </p><p>Western Niger Delta Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Plant, and </p><p>the Chevron Gas-to-Liquids project.  Lukman suggested that as </p><p>these projects develop it would only be natural for product </p><p>exports to be directed to the U.S. market.  He explained that </p><p>the existing Shell-led Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Plant </p><p>supplied the European market, and hoped that a U.S. LNG plant </p><p>would supply the United States.  Lukman went on to reiterate </p><p>a GON goal first stated by Lukman during President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>recent May visit to Washington: to capture 5% of the U.S. gas </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) MARGINAL FIELDS/YEAR 2001 OFFSHORE ROUND: The </p><p>upcoming "marginal field" round was also raised.  Dr. Lukman </p><p>stated that this round will take place in the near future, </p><p>and that a separate deep off-shore round will take place in </p><p>September 2001.  The "marginal field" round will not only </p><p>provide opportunities for indigenous operators, but also for </p><p>U.S. independents.  Independent American companies may bid as </p><p>technical partners alongside Nigerian firms. This exercise </p><p>should broaden the Nigerian oil sector, and could potentially </p><p>bring a new type of American oil firm to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) OCEAN ENERGY: Following on the topic of independents, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter raised the case of Ocean Energy, and </p><p>explained that the USG had still not received an explanation </p><p>for the revocation of its oil block award.  (Note:  Ocean </p><p>Energy was awarded a share of OPL 250, this award was later </p><p>revoked for reasons still unknown. (Ref B).  End Note.) Dr. </p><p>Lukman replied that he didn\'t know what had happened, and </p><p>that the question should be directed to President Obasanjo. </p><p>Lukman offered that "he hoped people did not mess things up </p><p>again, because the President has been clear to give them </p><p>(Ocean Energy) another chance."  Lukman said he believed </p><p>Ocean Energy "to be a good company, but someone may have </p><p>given President Obasanjo inaccurate information."  However, </p><p>Lukman encouraged Ocean Energy to bid again, but to do so </p><p>independently.  Ambassador noted that this was previously the </p><p>advice we had given to Ocean Energy, and had urged them to </p><p>become better known in Nigeria prior to the net offshore </p><p>round.  Lukman emphasized opportunities for U.S. independents </p><p>in general by pointing out that "we don\'t want all the big </p><p>boys." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) OPEC: In response to questions regarding Nigeria\'s </p><p>role in OPEC, Dr. Lukman stated that he remains the head of </p><p>the Nigerian delegation.  He is also the Alternate Chairman </p><p>of the Conference of OPEC Ministers.  Lukman believes that </p><p>the Iraqi action and the present crude shortfall will be made </p><p>up by OPEC members, but as a contingency OPEC members agreed </p><p>to meet in July.  Lukman indicated the price band mechanism </p><p>in place would automatically trigger a 500,000 barrel a day </p><p>increase if necessary.  When asked if the GON would be in </p><p>favor of increasing production beyond 500,000 barrels if the </p><p>price of crude continued to increase, Dr. Lukman replied that </p><p>"we would have to do something." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) DOUBLING NIGERIAN PRODUCTION: On the domestic </p><p>front, Dr. Lukman explained that the GON has embarked upon a </p><p>plan to nearly double current production capacity from 2.5 </p><p>million barrels a day and reserves of 25 billion barrels to 4 </p><p>million barrels a day and 40 billion barrels of reserves by </p><p>2010.  The GON intends to gradually increase production and </p><p>reserve levels in tandem. Then as the demand for OPEC oil </p><p>grows, the GON will be in a position to increase crude </p><p>exports as OPEC quotas increase.  (Presently, Nigeria has </p><p>some spare capacity on the order of several hundred thousand </p><p>barrels per day.  In addition, Nigeria produces 120,000 </p><p>barrels of condensate a day that is not included within the </p><p>OPEC quota.)  Dr. Lukman indicated OPEC countries eventually </p><p>want to establish a reserve equivalent to 10 percent of their </p><p>production capacity as a "market cushion." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) COMMENT: The meeting with Dr. Lukman was very </p><p>positive and very productive; however, he is obviously a </p><p>skilled diplomat who was careful to emphasize the positive </p><p>future ahead for U.S. companies.  If his statements are </p><p>correct, we could see an early end to the Year 2000 PSC </p><p>stalemate.  This will clear the way for a "marginal field" </p><p>round and an additional deep offshore round.  Investment </p><p>opportunities for U.S. companies are real. We hope that the </p><p>GON is sincere in its desire to reconfigure the oil sector so </p><p>that over time U.S. firms become the leading producers. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter stated that such a move would clearly </p><p>illustrate that the U.S. - Nigeria bilateral relationship is </p><p>indeed a "special" one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) We still have no answer on Ocean Energy, but are told </p><p>that the U.S. independent should try again.  Lukman agreed </p><p>that a regular dialogue with the Ambassador would be helpful, </p><p>and we intend to take him up on that offer. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
