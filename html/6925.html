<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 002062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT, EUR/SE, AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TF01IZ: TURKS "SERIOUSLY WORKING" ON CLOSURE OF </p><p>IRAQI MISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 75557 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1802 </p><p>     C. STATE 72921 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) On March 28, the DCM met with Deputy DG for Middle </p><p>Eastern Affairs Safak Gokturk to reiterate our requests </p><p>concerning Iraqi intelligence agents/diplomats.  Reiterating </p><p>information that Post recently had passed to the Turkish </p><p>National Intelligence Organization (TNIO), the DCM again </p><p>asked that the GOT close the Iraqi mission in Turkey.  He </p><p>described this as the best way to deny Iraqi support to those </p><p>who would engage in terrorist acts against U.S. interests in </p><p>Turkey.  If a closure were not yet possible, he urged that </p><p>the Turks quickly expel specific Iraqis whom he identified as </p><p>threats to U.S. personnel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that we had knowledge of Iraqi </p><p>sleeper cells in 11 countries, including Turkey.  He urged </p><p>that the GOT take action based on this highly credible threat </p><p>information.  He highlighted our understanding, reinforced by </p><p>recent Iraqi efforts to surveil Embassy residences, that the </p><p>Iraqis pose an immediate threat to us.  Though he thanked the </p><p>GOT for its security support to date, he also noted that some </p><p>of Turkey\'s neighbors had already acted via targeted </p><p>expulsions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Though Gokturk was not more forthcoming </p><p>immediately, he said that the MFA is "seriously working" in </p><p>coordination with TNIO and other GOT agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
