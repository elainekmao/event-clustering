<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR R, ECA, IIP, EUR/PPD, EUR/SE, EUR/EX, IIP/G/, </p><p>IIP/G/R, VIENNA FOR RPO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KIRC </p><p>SUBJECT: THREE AMERICAN CORNERS OPEN IN TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  In the past week, the U.S. Mission in Turkey </p><p>has opened three uniquely Turkey-specific American corners </p><p>in three of the most dynamic business cities of the country. </p><p>The venues are the headquarters of Chambers of Commerce and </p><p>Industry in those cities. We believe that the venues are on </p><p>target, that the timing is significant given the current </p><p>state of the bilateral relationship and that the media </p><p>impact of opening all three during the same week will have a </p><p>positive impact on attracting an audience. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. BACKGROUND: For several years, business leaders, </p><p>academics and others have called for a more tangible </p><p>American presence and more information about America in </p><p>provincial capitals outside of our consular cities. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson and Embassy/Consulate officers have </p><p>sympathized with these requests, but there was no mechanism </p><p>or funding for new initiatives.  We were aware of the </p><p>successful Russian model of American Corners, but Turkey </p><p>does not have the highly developed network of cultural </p><p>palaces and libraries or the SEED, FSA or other funding that </p><p>exists for ex-Communist countries. Our contacts were </p><p>specifically requesting a U.S. Business Information Center </p><p>and chamber of commerce and industry leaders in different </p><p>cities had shown an interest in hosting them  (as they were </p><p>already doing for well-funded/staffed EU offices).  In early </p><p>FY01 the Public Affairs Section was able to set aside </p><p>$10,000 from program funds with the intention of </p><p>accumulating reference materials and a designated computer </p><p>to give chamber staff access to Mission IRCs, FCS offices </p><p>and the Consular Sections. Even to do this we had to get </p><p>Turkish blessing through a Diplomatic Note exchange with the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  That was completed in February </p><p>of 2002.  We drew on the models presented by our Moscow </p><p>colleagues at the Global PAO conference in April 2002 and </p><p>the RPO Vienna presentations by IRO Eric Johnson.  We </p><p>ordered materials and equipment for our experimental site at </p><p>the Chamber of Industry in Gaziantep. The cost of the </p><p>equipment, materials and travel of staff, ours and the </p><p>chambers, for set-up and training grew to over $30,000.  In </p><p>the course of the summer, the Department allocated  $55,000 </p><p>for our American Corner initiative.  But now we had learned </p><p>how to do it "on the cheap" and we had good arguments for </p><p>expanding the effort to other cities. Accordingly, instead </p><p>of one center, we took the monies available and ordered two </p><p>more sets of equipment and began looking for appropriate </p><p>hosts. We settled on the bustling business cities of Bursa </p><p>and Kayseri.END BACKGROUND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. WHY THERE?  The original impetus for centers for American </p><p>information came from the business community and they were </p><p>thinking of FCS outreach. Turkish libraries are not well </p><p>developed or staffed and the universities have American </p><p>Studies or EFL centers where the focus is strictly academic </p><p>and access is limited by school holidays, short hours and </p><p>student-only policies. Business chambers are well-known, </p><p>have an eager constituency and we made availability to the </p><p>public an obligation in the protocols that we have signed </p><p>with them. The three cities are legendary for their </p><p>aggressive businessmen.  The chambers compete with each </p><p>other and that could be an additional boost to their support </p><p>for their "corners".  Gaziantep is in the South East, served </p><p>by the Consulate in Adana.  This is the section of Turkey </p><p>that has suffered most from the long Kurdish insurgency, </p><p>from the embargo on Iraq and from economic crises. Placing </p><p>an office there demonstrated our commitment to helping this </p><p>region. The local university has an active EFL department </p><p>and is working towards a linkage with the State University </p><p>of New York.  A "corner" there would have an audience. </p><p>Kayseri natives are proud of their reputation as sharp </p><p>traders. It is the hometown of the Foreign Minister, and has </p><p>a university that is heavily supported by the business </p><p>community - a concept we can support. Bursa is the fourth </p><p>largest city in Turkey, a major business center and recently </p><p>the site of our EFL Summer Institute. It is in the Istanbul </p><p>Consular district and the presence of the corner will help </p><p>to give the Consulate access to this lively community. The </p><p>chamber there offered near-palatial space in a dramatic new </p><p>building. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. WHY NOW?  Turkey has long been an important ally and this </p><p>kinds of outreach was needed to get out of the Ankara- </p><p>Istanbul "beltway" mentality. But during the past three </p><p>years, with two economic crises and frequent political </p><p>shakeups, the confidence of foreign investors and of Turks </p><p>themselves has been shaken. While the US supported Turkey\'s </p><p>efforts at EU accession and economic reform, the </p><p>disagreement over involvement in the war with Iraq, </p><p>particularly the March 1, 2002 vote not to permit the </p><p>deployment of American troops on Turkish soil and the </p><p>opening of a northern front, led to much anguish in both </p><p>countries about the state of the relationship and whether </p><p>the old friendship would survive. The Gaziantep "corner" was </p><p>set up just as the build-up to the war in Iraq and the </p><p>increasing public criticism of the US and demonstrations in </p><p>front of our embassy and consulates (and McDonalds) </p><p>increased. It made sense to hold off on a visible opening. </p><p>But since Secretary Powell\'s April visit to Turkey and </p><p>subsequent exchanges of visits, evidence of the intent to </p><p>work together is coming back. Accordingly, we spread out, </p><p>the DCM to Kayseri, the PAO to Gaziantep and the Consul </p><p>General from Istanbul to Bursa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. THE OPENINGS: On June 18, DCM Robert Deutsch cut the </p><p>ribbon at the Chamber of Commerce in Kayseri after calling </p><p>on the Deputy Governor of the province and Deputy Mayor of </p><p>the city. National and local press were on hand for the </p><p>ribbon cutting and caught the city\'s most powerful business </p><p>leaders and the DCM interacting with the chamber staffer who </p><p>would be the link to Mission commercial, consular and </p><p>educational resource people. In Kayseri, Public Affairs, FCS </p><p>and Consulate Adana staff were on hand to demonstrate how </p><p>the "U.S. Information Office" could be used as the Governor, </p><p>Mayor, Rector of the local university and asked questions </p><p>and posed for the cameras. In Bursa, Istanbul Consul General </p><p>David Arnett, with Public Affairs staff, paid official calls </p><p>on the Governor, the Mayor, and at Uludag University. </p><p>During the course of this official visit, on June 24, the CG </p><p>and staff were joined by the Governor and senior chamber </p><p>members in a well-publicized opening at chamber headquarters </p><p>located in the Organized Industrial Zone.   Local papers </p><p>front paged the event in highly favorable coverage as did </p><p>Bursa TV stations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. THE FUTURE: Now comes the test. We have passed through </p><p>numerous complicated steps, set up venue-specific centers </p><p>and trained bright chamber staffers in our IRCs, FCS offices </p><p>and Fulbright offices in Istanbul and Ankara.  We have </p><p>effectively drawn the attention of the local and national </p><p>leadership and potential audiences to the institutions.  Now </p><p>we have to make them work.  The Gaziantep staffer has </p><p>developed a visitor recording template which can be used for </p><p>contact management and the development of an outreach list. </p><p>We are beginning to get questions from the attendees at the </p><p>opening events. We will be sending out electronic flyers </p><p>reminding invitees and chamber members of the contact </p><p>numbers of their centers.  We have agreed that after the </p><p>summer vacation period in Turkey, we will launch a "Doing </p><p>Business with America" road show that will have our </p><p>Commercial and Agricultural Offices, the Caspian Trade </p><p>Initiative and the Mission\'s Econ section all involved in </p><p>making the "corners" visibly useful tools.  Our English </p><p>language and American studies contacts are already being </p><p>informed that these centers are open to them and viable </p><p>sites for research, seminars and meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
