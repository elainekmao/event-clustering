<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB - A/S WAYNE, E, AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LOEVINGER, MILLS, AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESSING TURKEY ON ECONOMIC REFORM:  NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 0301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Embassy will continue to deliver the economic reform </p><p>message (reftel) in meetings with senior government </p><p>officials, AK Party leaders, and key parliamentarians.  In </p><p>these meetings, we will remind the government that its own </p><p>bureaucrats (specifically at Treasury) say they need the $1.7 </p><p>billion IMF disbursement in February, so there is no time to </p><p>waste.  We expect IMF Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger </p><p>and World Bank Vice President Johannes Lim, who will make </p><p>separate visits to Turkey later this week, to make similar </p><p>points to Prime Minister Gul, Deputy Prime Minister Sener, </p><p>and other top GOT officials.  Following these meetings, </p><p>Embassy will send in its assessment of where the reform </p><p>program stands along with recommendations on any additional </p><p>steps we need to consider. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The private sector is also pressing the government. </p><p>TUSIAD (Turkish Industrialists Association) Chairman Tuncay </p><p>Ozilhan yesterday urged the government to stick to the reform </p><p>program (septel), and market players tell us they are </p><p>vigorously sending the same message.  GOT officials tell us </p><p>it was market pressure -- in the form of an unsuccessful </p><p>Treasury auction -- that led to Prime Minister Gul\'s </p><p>announcement of new fiscal measures last week. </p><p>3.  (C) The possibility of a substantial bilateral U.S. </p><p>assistance package is a complicating factor, as it creates a </p><p>clear moral hazard.  Embassy has been stressing to Turks </p><p>(including in the private sector) that any U.S. assistance </p><p>will be conditioned on, among other things, continued </p><p>implementation of the reform program and successful </p><p>completion of periodic IMF reviews.  It is critical that we </p><p>stick firmly to that message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
