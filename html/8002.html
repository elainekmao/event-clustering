(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires, a.i., Richard A. </p><p>Albright for Reasons 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: A round of meetings with UAE </p><p>officials confirmed earlier reports (see Refs A and B), </p><p>that the UAEG has not yet succeeded 100 percent in </p><p>implementing and enforcing the child camel jockey ban that </p><p>went into effect on 1 September 2002.  The senior </p><p>leadership, however, continues to push forward.  Efforts to </p><p>end the use of child camel jockeys, and thereby eliminate </p><p>this market for trafficking in boys, have been complicated </p><p>by a number of factors, not the least of which were the </p><p>resistance to change from the older generation of Emiratis </p><p>and a lack of willingness in some instances on the part of </p><p>working-level officials to enforce the rules.  Efforts are </p><p>also hampered by the fact that the draft legislation has </p><p>not yet been ratified, although it has been approved by the </p><p>UAE Cabinet.  (Note: Once ratified, the ban will move from </p><p>regulation to federal law, enforceable by law enforcement </p><p>officials. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT, CONT\'D: We are encouraged that </p><p>the Emiratis have given themselves a 2-year deadline for </p><p>full implementation, a timeframe that is reasonable, </p><p>considering resistance to the ban and the time of its </p><p>announcement just about a month prior to the start of the </p><p>racing season.  We also consider this timeframe doable </p><p>because of strong political will, as evidenced by MinState </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan\'s commitment to ending this deplorable </p><p>practice.  Hamdan has personally lobbied the leaders of </p><p>other Emirates to implement the new regulations and approve </p><p>the draft legislation.  He has expended considerable </p><p>political capital in so doing.  Hamdan has also been very </p><p>receptive to the Embassy\'s interventions, including our </p><p>report that the UAE Camel Racing Federation was not </p><p>carrying out its duties or his instructions.  END SUMMARY </p><p>AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Over the past several weeks, Poloff met with a </p><p>number of UAEG contacts to get a readout on the </p><p>implementation and enforcement of the new camel jockey </p><p>requirements (minimum 15 years and 45 kilograms) effective </p><p>1 September 2002.  (Note: Camel season runs from September </p><p>- April.  End note.)  Interlocutors included:  Khadim Al </p><p>Darei, Office of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Deputy Director; Abdul Ghaffar Al Hawi, Ministry of Health </p><p>Asst U/S for Curative Medicine; Abdulrahim Al Awadi, </p><p>Ministry of Justice Asst U/S for Planning and International </p><p>Cooperation; Yacub Al-Hosani, MFA Legal Affairs Department </p><p>Deputy Director; and Khalfan Khamees, Managing Director of </p><p>the UAE Camel Racing Federation. </p><p> </p><p>Status of Camel Jockey Legislation </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On 6 May, Abdulrahim Al Awadi, Ministry of </p><p>Justice Asst U/S for Planning and International </p><p>Cooperation, reported to Poloff that the camel jockey </p><p>legislation had been approved by the UAE Cabinet (a.k.a. </p><p>Council of Ministers) and was currently at the Office of </p><p>the Minister of State for Supreme Council Affairs awaiting </p><p>signatures from the seven emirates\' rulers.  (Note: The UAE </p><p>Supreme Council is the federation\'s executive authority and </p><p>ratifies all federal laws and decrees and plans general </p><p>policy. End note.)  Receipt of all seven signatures </p><p>constitutes ratification of the legislation.  The </p><p>legislation will then be published in the federal gazette </p><p>and have the effect of federal law. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) As reported Refs F and G, the draft legislation </p><p>provides that camel jockeys must be a minimum of 15 years </p><p>and weigh a minimum of 45 kilograms (approximately 99 </p><p>pounds).  The legislation will be implemented by the </p><p>issuance of camel jockey identification cards, which will </p><p>be granted to camel jockeys upon application after passing </p><p>a medical exam by a Medical Committee that determines the </p><p>age of the jockey through x-rays, tests, etc.  (Note: UAEG </p><p>officials state that the Medical Committee will not rely on </p><p>the age set forth in the jockey\'s passport because of the </p><p>possibility of passport fraud. End note.)  The legislation </p><p>will be enforced by the inspection of camel jockey </p><p>identification cards at camel races.  Penalties for </p><p>violation:  1st offense, fine of 20,000 dirhams (about 5500 </p><p>USD); 2nd offense, 1-year ban from participating in camel </p><p>racing; 3rd and subsequent offenses, imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p>Current State of Implementation of Camel Jockey Rules </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) On 4 May, Abdul Ghaffar Al-Hawi, Ministry of </p><p>Health Asst U/S for Curative Medicine, informed Poloff that </p><p>the UAEG intends to accomplish full implementation and </p><p>enforcement of the camel jockey legislation throughout the </p><p>UAE within two racing seasons, noting that 100 percent </p><p>implementation and enforcement was impossible to achieve in </p><p>one season. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) For his part, Al-Hawi noted that in September </p><p>2002, the Ministry of Health issued a circular to all </p><p>Curative Medicine offices nationwide with guidelines for </p><p>camel jockey medical exams, which will establish the age of </p><p>the camel jockey and judge his overall physical fitness. </p><p>(Note: Al-Hawi stated that this same medical exam process </p><p>is used to establish the age of professional soccer players </p><p>in the UAE, who are also required to be of a specified </p><p>minimum age. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Also, according to information provided by MFA </p><p>Desk Officer Shaykha Nejla Al-Qassimi on 11 May, the </p><p>Ministry of Interior conducted DNA tests on 40 boys (to </p><p>establish familial status with the boys\' supposed parents) </p><p>between 9 April - 5 May 2003 in connection with the </p><p>processing of their residency with employment as camel </p><p>jockeys. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Since the UAE Camel Racing Federation organizes </p><p>and officiates at camel races, on 29 April Poloff met with </p><p>Mr. Khalfan Khamees, Director of the UAE Camel Racing </p><p>Federation, to determine what has been implemented thus far </p><p>at the camel races.  Khamees reported that, during this </p><p>past camel racing season, the Federation implemented the </p><p>rules in part by weighing camel jockeys before and after </p><p>the races.  He continued that the Federation would begin </p><p>issuing identification cards with proof of age in May. </p><p>(Note: On 29 April, there was a press report in an Arabic- </p><p>language daily announcing that the Federation would begin </p><p>issuing identification cards in May for the 2003-2004 camel </p><p>racing season.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) When queried as to the minimum weight requirement </p><p>being used for camel jockeys, Khassim responded that </p><p>Federation officials were requiring a minimum weight of 35 </p><p>kilograms (about 75 pounds).  When asked why the Federation </p><p>was using 35 pounds vice the minimum weight requirement of </p><p>45 pounds contained in the draft legislation, Khassim </p><p>explained that there had been a "big uproar" after the </p><p>announcement of the new rules.  Apparently, the Federation </p><p>compromised on the minimum weight requirements as a result. </p><p>(Note:  Khassim noted that, prior to this camel-racing </p><p>season, the Federation had required a minimum camel jockey </p><p>weight of 20 kilograms (about 44 pounds).  End note.)  He </p><p>noted that Federation officials would begin enforcing the </p><p>age requirement this upcoming racing season, which would be </p><p>possible by the issuance of camel jockey identification </p><p>cards beginning in May. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Khassim also reported during the 29 April meeting </p><p>that the camel jockey regulation was not a law and that </p><p>"nobody knows [if the rule will become law]."  He also </p><p>stated that penalties for non-compliance were:  1st </p><p>offense, disqualification from the race; 2nd and subsequent </p><p>offenses, fine.  These statements were subsequently refuted </p><p>during Poloff\'s meetings with Ministry of Justice Asst U/S </p><p>for Planning and International Coordination Abdulrahim Al </p><p>Awadi on 6 May and with MFA Legal Affairs Deputy Director </p><p>Yacoub Al-Hosani on 10 May. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The Federation\'s failure to implement the camel </p><p>jockey minimum age/weight requirements is confirmed by an </p><p>episode of the ABC (Australia Broadcasting Corporation) </p><p>Foreign Correspondents Program broadcast in Australia on 23 </p><p>February.  (Note: Poloff discovered this information on 21 </p><p>April during an Internet search for information related to </p><p>camel jockeys in the UAE.  End note.)  For a copy, see </p><p>www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s789268.htm (synopsis) and </p><p>www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s792822.htm (transcript). </p><p>The program includes footage of a camel race in Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate and a camel station (where the camels are trained) </p><p>where boys obviously younger than 15 years are being used </p><p>as camel jockeys for races and training. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Polchief and Poloff have used the ABC </p><p>synopsis/transcript as an engagement tool on the issue of </p><p>child camel jockeys by providing a copy to UAE official and </p><p>NGO contacts.  We gave copies of the synopsis/transcript to </p><p>our interlocutors during our April awareness-raising trip </p><p>to Dubai, including:  two Dubai NGO leaders; a </p><p>journalist/UAE University professor; an American University </p><p>Sharjah professor; Director of Corporate Planning and </p><p>Excellence in Government for Dubai Crown Prince Shaykh </p><p>Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum\'s "Executive Office"; and </p><p>Dubai Public Prosecutor\'s Office Deputy Director of Case </p><p>Management (see Ref A).  Poloff also gave a copy to </p><p>MinState Shaykh Hamdan\'s Deputy Office Director Khadim Al- </p><p>Darei and MFA Americas Desk Officer Shaykha Nejla Al- </p><p>Qassimi on 23 April; UAE Camel Racing Federation Khalfan </p><p>Khamees on 29 April; and MFA Legal Affairs Department </p><p>Deputy Director Yacoub Al-Hosani on 10 May.  Post ordered a </p><p>video of the program and will disseminate it to UAEG </p><p>interlocutors for their edification, reaction and comment. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) On 4 May, Polchief briefed Yacoub Al-Hosani, MFA </p><p>Legal Affairs Department Deputy Director, on the content of </p><p>the Poloff-Khamees 29 April meeting, noting the </p><p>discrepancies between information about camel jockey rule </p><p>implementation provided to us by UAEG officials (including </p><p>during the G/TIP official visit in January) and by Khamees </p><p>on April 29.  Polchief reported that the Camel Racing </p><p>Federation had failed to implement the rules effectively </p><p>and had a different view of the process (i.e., not a law </p><p>and different penalties).  Al-Hosani was shocked by this </p><p>information because he stated that he had personally </p><p>briefed Khamees on the rules and the UAEG plan for </p><p>implementation and enforcement.  Al-Hosani undertook to </p><p>investigate the matter and respond promptly. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) On or about 6 May, Al-Hosani contacted PolChief and </p><p>reported the results of his investigation.  He noted that </p><p>he had passed the information we gave him about the Camel </p><p>Racing Federation\'s failure to implement the camel jockey </p><p>rules and apparent lack of knowledge of the ongoing process </p><p>to MFA Asst U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al- </p><p>Nuaimi and Ambassador Sultan Al-Romathi, Office Director </p><p>for MinState Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayid.  Al-Hosani stated </p><p>that later that day he and Al-Nuaimi were called into </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan\'s office, at which time Shaykh Hamdan, </p><p>incensed, telephoned Khamees.  During that conversation, </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan ordered Khamees to effectively implement the </p><p>rules and reprimanded him on his failure to follow-through </p><p>on Federation responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Al-Hosani advised that, as a result of the </p><p>information provided by Polchief, the MFA will soon post a </p><p>"legal advisor" to the UAE Camel Racing Federation to </p><p>ensure correct interpretation and implementation of the </p><p>camel jockey legislation.  Al-Hosani also implied that </p><p>Khassim might be asked to leave his position at the </p><p>Federation as a result of his failure to execute his </p><p>duties. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) In a follow-up meeting between Poloff and Al-Hosani </p><p>on 10 May, Al-Hosani advised that -- as an additional </p><p>result of the Federation fiasco -- the Legal Department is </p><p>considering recommending the creation of a working-level </p><p>group, in addition to the already-existing higher-level </p><p>official policy-making working group.  He explained that </p><p>the working-level group would report either to the MFA or </p><p>the higher-level official working group and have the </p><p>responsibility of following-up on the various taskings </p><p>assigned by the higher-level official working group to </p><p>ensure that those taskings are carried out properly and </p><p>timely. </p><p> </p><p>UAE Camel Racing Federation: Organization and Operations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Shaykh Zayid\'s son, Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed, currently serves as </p><p>Chairman of the UAE Camel Racing Federation and is </p><p>responsible for overseeing the Federation\'s operations. </p><p>Khamees reported that President Zayed personally funds the </p><p>UAE Camel Racing Federation and camel races (along with all </p><p>purses) in all emirates except Dubai Emirate, which are </p><p>funded by the Dubai ruling family. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) In 1993, President Zayed issued a decree </p><p>establishing the UAE Camel Racing Federation, an </p><p>administrative body to organize and oversee the different </p><p>aspects and activities of camel races.  The Federation </p><p>subsequently issued rules and regulations for the </p><p>organization and conduct of camel races, including minimum </p><p>age and weight requirements for camel jockeys.  After many </p><p>years of prior use of underage camel jockeys, Federation </p><p>officials reportedly discovered the minimum age and weight </p><p>requirements to be contentious among camel owners and, </p><p>according to UAE Camel Racing Federation officials, the </p><p>minimum age and weight requirements were not enforced. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) All racetracks are fully maintained by the UAE </p><p>Camel Racing Federation.  According to Khamees, there are </p><p>no private racecourses.  All racetracks are administered by </p><p>an organizing committee, which reports directly to the </p><p>Federation Director on the conduct of races, including the </p><p>implementation of rules and regulations.  Racetrack </p><p>officers actually operate the racetrack and report to the </p><p>organizing committee\'s Director of Operations.  The </p><p>racetrack officers\' responsibilities specifically include </p><p>jockey control. </p><p> </p><p>Camels and Camel Racing: Part of UAE Culture and Heritage </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U) Khamees stated that camel racing is a "dear part </p><p>of UAE culture", which President Zayid is committed to </p><p>maintaining.  (Note: This sentiment regarding camel racing </p><p>has been expressed by all of our contacts. End note.)  In </p><p>the past, camels were an essential part of the economy and </p><p>lives of Emiratis; camels were used to transport goods, </p><p>served as currency, and were a source of meat, milk, </p><p>leather and wool (used for weaving).  The number of camels </p><p>an individual owned determined his prestige, power, and </p><p>social status.  Khamees noted that many Emiratis from all </p><p>walks of life, from shaykhs to the Bedu, sill own and breed </p><p>camels and often participate in camel races.  Consequently, </p><p>the breeding and trade in camels remains today a big </p><p>business in the UAE, especially for the Bedu. </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
