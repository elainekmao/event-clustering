<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>--Lead story in all papers today, May 20, focuses on </p><p>the series of suicide bombings that took place </p><p>yesterday in Israel.  Front-page stories continue to </p><p>focus on preparations for the Jordanian parliamentary </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who is responsible for the bloodshed?" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/20) editorializes:  "No one has to look very hard </p><p>for the real cause for this recent escalation of </p><p>violence on both the Palestinian and the Israeli </p><p>fronts.  It is Sharon and his extremist right-wing </p><p>government.  They have closed off the road for peace </p><p>and destroyed the accords and they continue their war </p><p>of settlements, colonization and invasions..  It is </p><p>truly sad that the world stands watching the Israeli </p><p>arrogance.  The Israeli government commits crimes on </p><p>daily basis against the Palestinians without any </p><p>condemnation or denunciation..  We call on the United </p><p>States and the international community to intervene </p><p>strongly in order to salvage the peace plan and to put </p><p>an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people.  We </p><p>also look to the people in Palestine to pull in their </p><p>ranks, to put their differences aside, and to </p><p>formulate a unified strategy that would enable the </p><p>people to confront the challenges leading to their </p><p>freedom and independence." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The terrorism that serves the enemies" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Yaqoub Jaber writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/20):  "It is probably too early to say that Al- </p><p>Qa\'eda organization was responsible for the bombings </p><p>in Riyadh and Casablanca.  Yet, we can safely say that </p><p>such bombings against targets related to the foreign </p><p>and American presence marks a reaction against the war </p><p>that the United States launched against Iraq.. </p><p>According to these groups, terrorism is the only means </p><p>of revenge, since armies have failed to protect </p><p>national independence.  But they do not realize that </p><p>their push for terrorist actions out of revenge is </p><p>actually harming their own people and their own </p><p>countries and the image of Arabs and Muslims in the </p><p>world.  It is our duty to warn that terrorists may </p><p>take advantage of the fall of Baghdad to spread death </p><p>and destruction and to continue to defame Arabs and </p><p>Muslims.  We would not blame the governments if they </p><p>deal harshly with those who chose terrorism as a means </p><p>of self-expression, a means that serves only the </p><p>objectives of the enemies and the adversaries." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
