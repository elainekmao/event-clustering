Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C/NF) Summary:  President Obasanjo may defuse the mounting </p><p>tension within the Police Force over salary arrearages and, </p><p>in the process be seen as getting a handle on the greater </p><p>law-and-order crisis afflicting the country, by sacking the </p><p>ineffectual Musiliu Smith, Inspector General of Police. </p><p>Smith has been little more than a cipher and his removal </p><p>could create room to implement much needed strategic reforms </p><p>within the Nigerian Police.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C/NF) Musiliu Smith was appointed Inspector General of </p><p>Police by President Obasanjo in late 1999.  Smith\'s </p><p>appointment is largely seen as political since he "jumped </p><p>queue" over two more senior NPF officers to become IGP.  By </p><p>even the most charitable assessments, Smith\'s performance has </p><p>been unremarkable, though he has been able to avoid any </p><p>career-threatening gaffes, until now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C/NF) In a March 4 meeting with RNLEO, the Chairman of the </p><p>new Police Service Commission Chief Simon Okeke disclosed </p><p>that President Obasanjo has called a meeting of the National </p><p>Police Council at 3:00 p.m. on March 6.  The Police Council </p><p>was established by the 1999 Constitution,  is chaired by the </p><p>President and includes: the nation\'s 36 governors; the Vice </p><p>President; the National Security Advisor; the IGP; and the </p><p>Police Service Commission Chairman.  The last time the NPC </p><p>met was late 1999 to appoint Smith as the new IGP. According </p><p>to Okeke, the NPC should be convened to address major law and </p><p>order crises or to hire/fire the Inspector General of Police; </p><p>this time it appears it is being convened for both reasons, </p><p>opined the PSC Chairman.  Okeke showed RNLEO a copy of the </p><p>President\'s order for the meeting and the meeting\'s agenda, </p><p>which lists one item -- "the Administration of the Nigeria </p><p>Police Force." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C/NF) The January Police strike was grounded in </p><p>long-standing grievances of enlisted personnel (Constables, </p><p>Corporals, Sergeants and Inspectors) about unpaid salaries </p><p>and allowances.  Senior NPF officers, including the IGP, are </p><p>aware of the deteriorating welfare of their subordinates but </p><p>have been unresponsive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C/NF) In mid-January Smith dismissed reports of that </p><p>strike without adequately investigating the discontent within </p><p>his police ranks.  Days before the rumored January 25 strike, </p><p>Smith falsely assured the President there would be no strike </p><p>(and therefore no need to address the strikers\' grievances </p><p>immediately).  With that, Smith departed for the Hajj in </p><p>Mecca.  When the strike erupted -- albeit only in some parts </p><p>of the country --- the President was caught off-guard. </p><p>Obasanjo reportedly ordered Smith back to Nigeria when Smith </p><p>did not fly back immediately after receiving news of the </p><p>strike\'s outbreak. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C/NF) Obasanjo felt betrayed by Smith\'s irresponsible </p><p>behavior, according to PSC members and other Post sources. </p><p>One PSC member close to Vice President Atiku Abubakar claims </p><p>the VP, referring to Smith, recently stated to the PSC </p><p>member; "Can you believe it?  He lied to us!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C/NF) Comment:  President Obasanjo is under growing </p><p>political pressure to address the country\'s communal </p><p>violence/security crisis and reform the reform-resistant </p><p>Police.  It appears likely the President will dismiss Smith </p><p>and appoint a new IGP imminently.  The dismissal of Smith </p><p>within the next few days would almost certainly lower </p><p>tensions within the lower ranks of the Police Force and might </p><p>help to forestall the much-bruited but not definite March 11 </p><p>police strike.  Smith has been personally blamed for much of </p><p>the NPF\'s failure to address the serious, long-standing </p><p>grievances of enlisted personnel -- a not altogether unfair </p><p>assessment though the responsibility is not his alone.  But </p><p>he clearly has become a liability for Obasanjo and, if our </p><p>sources are reliable, has thus offended his only political </p><p>patron.  His sacking might also help our Police Reform </p><p>activities since he is less than enthusiastic about the </p><p>fundamental changes necessary for the NPF to become an asset </p><p>for democratic rule in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
