Not for internet </p><p>distribution </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Since his appointment as the new </p><p>Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in November, Sami </p><p>Goclu appears more willing than his predecessors to engage </p><p>agriculture businesses and seek their input on important </p><p>issues.  Moreover, many officials believe Goclu will </p><p>delegate greater authority to his subordinates which should </p><p>facilitate work with the Ministry.  At the same time, the </p><p>Ministry will most likely pursue a policy of self- </p><p>sufficiency and market protection against agriculture </p><p>imports.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>An Economist from Konya </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Professor Sami Guclu (pronounced Goochlu) was </p><p>named the new Turkish Minister of Agriculture in November </p><p>2002.  He was born in the Konya region, the breadbasket of </p><p>Turkey. An economist by training, Minister Gulu most </p><p>recently was with the faculty at Sakarya University in the </p><p>Black-Sea city, Adapazar.  He worked at the university with </p><p>the current Prime Minister, Abdullah Gul.  Although he has </p><p>only held his position for the past four months, there are </p><p>signs that the Ministry may break from past practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Cautiously Optimistic </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Turkish industry reaction might be characterized </p><p>as cautiously optimistic.  However, this may in part be a </p><p>reaction to the previous Minister of Agriculture, Husnu </p><p>Gokalp, who showed little trust in the private sector.  One </p><p>concern that industry officials noted was Minister Guclu\'s </p><p>lack of agricultural background.  Although he worked for a </p><p>short time in the Agriculture Supply Organization at the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture, the majority of his experience has </p><p>been in academics and in economics rather than agriculture. </p><p>One industry contact noted that the Minister did not fully </p><p>understand the relationship between imports of feed and </p><p>production of poultry.  Although the Ministry would like to </p><p>decrease agriculture imports, it would be difficult for </p><p>Turkey to produce poultry meat without feed imports.  In the </p><p>end, however, the industry was optimistic that Guclu would </p><p>adjust to the job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Delegating Authority </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Minister has been relying on close advisors to </p><p>navigate through difficult issues.  The Ministry has </p><p>budgetary concerns as well as a large, and generally poor, </p><p>farming sector.  Officials in the Ministry believe that, </p><p>unlike his predecessors, Minister Guclu will delegate more </p><p>responsibility to his subordinates which would facilitate </p><p>work and relationships with the private sector and other </p><p>governments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) There have been other positive signs, as well. </p><p>Recently, the Minister met with a number of private sector </p><p>officials to discuss their concerns with new Turkish </p><p>phytosanitary regulations. (Reftels)  At a meeting with </p><p>FAS/Ankara staff, several representatives noted that they </p><p>were impressed by the Minister\'s willingness to solicit </p><p>opinions from the private sector.  Previous administrations </p><p>were more suspicious of industry, in general, and ignored </p><p>suggestions and complaints.  Guclu, not only met with the </p><p>private sector, but in the end supported their position and </p><p>suspended the regulations. One official emphatically stated </p><p>that it was the first time in 15 years that a Minister and a </p><p>Ministry had responded in such a way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Not all Rosy </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Despite these positive signs, it is still very </p><p>early in the administration.  Although the new government </p><p>has pledged support for the IMF-backed direct support </p><p>system, the government recently announced that it would </p><p>return to a production support system that has, in the past, </p><p>encouraged inefficiencies and over-production in tobacco, </p><p>hazelnuts and sugar beets.  One cynical private sector </p><p>observer noted that normally politicians give gifts like </p><p>this before the elections, not after.  This change has also </p><p>raised some concern from both the World Bank and IMF.  The </p><p>Ministry also recognizes the need to increase direct foreign </p><p>investment in agriculture, but continues to alienate many </p><p>foreign companies who already have invested here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) On the trade side, Ministry officials continue to </p><p>espouse the goal of self-sufficiency in agricultural </p><p>production.  Through various licensing mechanisms the </p><p>Ministry continues to prevent imports of meat despite the </p><p>product\'s inclusion in many bilateral trade agreements.  In </p><p>addition, the Ministry maintains high tariffs on most </p><p>agriculture imports.  As a result, the Turkish consumer is </p><p>forced to pay 149 percent tariff on bananas despite the fact </p><p>that Turkey only produces 15 percent of its domestic demand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Better U.S.-Turkish Ag Relations </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) During the past few months in meetings with </p><p>FAS/Ankara reps, Ministry officials have expressed their </p><p>desire to increase contacts with USDA and U.S. agriculture </p><p>representatives.  Turkish officials appear open to </p><p>facilitating this relationship.  Training programs offer the </p><p>prospect of improving relationships between officials in </p><p>both countries.  Post has already discussed some future </p><p>collaboration with APHIS and GIPSA representatives in </p><p>providing some technical information to government and </p><p>private sector officials.  Improving these relations </p><p>especially on technical issues could facilitate discussions </p><p>on trade and trade issues, not only bilateral but also in </p><p>multilateral discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A Tough Road Ahead </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment.  It is not difficult in fact to </p><p>understand the Ministry\'s position.  Although it has a </p><p>vibrant food-processing sector, 40 percent of the Turkish </p><p>population lives in rural areas, many at subsistence income </p><p>levels. The Ministry, therefore, is compelled to support </p><p>local production despite inefficiencies.  In turn, this </p><p>helps slow migration to already crowded urban areas.  In </p><p>addition, with EU negotiations somewhere in the future, </p><p>raising Turkish agricultural productivity and encouraging </p><p>greater efficiencies will be most important.  However, the </p><p>lack of funds for supporting the sector may be so </p><p>prohibitive and the needs so great that it may be very </p><p>difficult to reach these goals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
