(U) AT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) ANNUAL </p><p>CONGRESS THAT BEGAN SEPTEMBER 6, CFU PRESIDENT TIM </p><p>HENWOOD ANNOUNCED IN HIS OPENING SPEECH THAT THE CFU </p><p>WOULD REFILE A CLASS ACTION SUIT, WITHDRAWN A MONTH </p><p>AGO (REF B), TO CHALLENGE THE LAW GOVERNING THE </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT.  THE </p><p>CFU STATED THAT IT WAS TAKING THE ACTION AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THE HALTING OF POLICE ACTION TO EVICT SQUATTERS, AND </p><p>BECAUSE ITS MEMBERSHIP UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO </p><p>VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THEIR LEGAL REMEDIES.  IN HIS SPEECH </p><p>HENWOOD STATED, "WE HAVE AGAIN SEEN MINISTERS\' </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS COUNTERMANDED AND POLICE ACTION </p><p>CURTAILED.  MEANWHILE MASSIVE LISTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>PUBLISHED OF FARMS TO BE ACQUIRED, AND BANKS TELL US </p><p>THERE WILL BE NO FINANCE FOR AFFECTED FARMERS.  ....IF </p><p>THE PLAN IS CARRIED OUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM, MOST </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WOULD SEE THEIR LIVES SLUMP TO A DEPTH OF </p><p>POVERTY NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD." </p><p>HENWOOD ALSO SAID THAT DUE TO THE HISTORY OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04979  071359Z </p><p>INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY ON THE </p><p>FARMS, THE UNION FEARED THAT IF INDIVIDUAL FARMERS </p><p>FILED SUITS, THAT THEY WOULD BE SINGLED OUT FOR </p><p>PUNSIHMENT AND RETRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE NEW CFU SUIT (AS IN THE EARLIER, WITHDRAWN </p><p>LEGAL ACTION, REF C), CITES PRESIDENT MUGABE, POLICE </p><p>COMMISSIONER CHIHURI AND WAR VETS LEADER CHENJARAI </p><p>"HITLER" HUNZVI AS RESPONDENTS.  THE CLASS ACTION </p><p>CHALLENGES THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE </p><p>LAND FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT COMPENSATION.  IT </p><p>QUESTIONS THE VALIDITY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS ACT </p><p>THAT HAS BEEN USED TO AMEND THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT </p><p>OF 1992, CITING THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>OVERSIGHT AND AUTHORITY.  THE CFU HOPES TO FILE THE </p><p>SUIT BEFORE THE END OF THIS WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: WE WOULD WELCOME AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN </p><p>THE CFU AND THE GOZ.  HOWEVER, THE CFU MEMBERSHIP IS </p><p>CLEARLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGERED AT WHAT IT SEES AS A </p><p>TOTAL LACK OF GOOD FAITH BY THE GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN LIGHT OF ITS WITHDRAWAL OF ITS LEGAL CHALLENGE AT </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S BEHEST A MONTH AGO.  IN SUM, NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>HAVE GONE NOWHERE, AND SPECIFICALLY, IN THAT TIME THE </p><p>GOZ HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY SERIOUS DIALOGUE OR </p><p>NEGOTIATION WITH THE UNION, AND HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>BROKEN ITS PROMISIES AND COMMITMENTS.  IN MEETINGS THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAS HAD WITH A HOST OF MINISTERS, IT IS </p><p>CLEAR TO US THAT CONFUSION REIGNS THROUGHOUT </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON THE ISSUE, WITH ONLY THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>OFFICE PROVIDING SPORADIC, DICTATORIAL DIRECTION.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04979  071359Z </p><p>REST OF THE CABINET MOUTHS THE ZANU-PF PARTY LINE IN </p><p>DIRECT DEFIANCE OF REALITY.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE </p><p>GOZ HAS NO LAND REFORM "PROGRAM."  THE SEIZURE AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EFFORT, CARRIED OUT IN NO SMALL PART BY </p><p>VIOLENT AND ILLEGAL MEANS, IS A STAKE POISED OVER THE </p><p>ECONOMIC HEART OF ZIMBABWE.  HOWEVER, NO ONE IN </p><p>CABINET IS WILLING TO TELL MUGABE THAT HIS POLITICAL </p><p>CALCULUS MAY WELL BE INCORRECT, AND THAT THE ONLY </p><p>SEEDS HE IS SOWING ARE SEEDS OF DISASTER.  WITH VOICES </p><p>FROM WITHIN SILENT OR IGNORED, WE FEAR THAT VOICES </p><p>FROM WITHOUT WILL GET LESS RESPECT.  MUGABE, WITH HIS </p><p>EYES ON THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WILL GO IT </p><p>ALONE AND CONTINUE TO USE THE LAND PROBLEM AS A </p><p>BLATANT POLITICAL TOOL, EVEN AT THE COST OF A </p><p>FUNCTIONING ECONOMY AND THE COLLAPSE OF NATIONAL </p><p>INCOME.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
