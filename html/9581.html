<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 THE HAGUE 001855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR C. CORRINO; STATE FOR G, G/TIP, DRL, PRM, OES: J. </p><p>CHOW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ELAB, KCRM, KHIV, KWMN, PHUM, PTER, SMIG, SNAR </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S JONES\' HAGUE VISIT: TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, </p><p>JUSTICE, AND HIV ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) 1.  In a July 15 visit to The Hague, A/S Jones met with </p><p>senior officials from MFA, MoD, and MoJ, parliamentarians, </p><p>the National Rapporteur for Trafficking, and with Mission </p><p>personnel.  This cable reports her discussions on trafficking </p><p>in people and counter-narcotics. The transatlantic </p><p>relationship, the Middle East, OSCE, and issues surrounding </p><p>French-German security ideas are reported septels.  A/S Jones </p><p>cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Trafficking in People </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(U) 2.  A/S Jones raised the problem of trafficking in </p><p>persons in meetings with the National Rapporteur for </p><p>Trafficking Korvinus, MoJ Secretary General Joris Demmink and </p><p>MFA deputy Political Director Herman Schaper.  She stressed </p><p>the importance of attacking the problem, both through </p><p>domestic programs and legislation and through multilateral </p><p>cooperation.  A/S Jones welcomed the role of the Netherlands </p><p>in making TIP a priority issue for its OSCE presidency, and </p><p>the Dutch asked for U.S. support for TIP recommendations </p><p>recently approved by the OSCE economic forum.  Dutch </p><p>officials said they will also make TIP a priority of their </p><p>European Union and Council of Europe presidencies in 2004. </p><p>MFA officials cited the linkages among drugs, trafficking, </p><p>and health epidemics.  Together, these three formed a "trail </p><p>of misery" through Central Asia and Eastern Europe.  They </p><p>lament a lack of cooperation between EU and Russia on these </p><p>issues.  All interlocutors agreed that it is essential to </p><p>focus political attention on the problem, with the MFA </p><p>focusing on cooperation internationally, the Justice Ministry </p><p>focusing on police issues, and the Rapporteur serving as the </p><p>prod to the Dutch government, including to offer more </p><p>services to victims. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 3.  A/S Jones inquired about the bill bringing Dutch TIP </p><p>legislation in line with the Palermo Protocol and the EU </p><p>framework decision on trafficking in persons.  Korvinus said </p><p>the bill was approved by the government on June 20, 2003, and </p><p>sent to the Council of State for review, after which it will </p><p>be sent to the Dutch parliament.  National Rapporteur </p><p>Korvinus expects some debate about the definition of </p><p>trafficking and working in slavery-like conditions, but she </p><p>has no doubt that the bill will be adopted.  With respect to </p><p>the UN Palermo Protocol, Korvinus said she is worried that </p><p>the protocol does not protect victims once they return to </p><p>their native countries after a trial.  Korvinus feared that </p><p>this would be an obstacle for victims to testify in court. </p><p>Jones shared her concerns, and suggested this could be an </p><p>area for cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 4.  A/S Jones asked whether the police are adequately </p><p>equipped to identify TIP victims.  Korvinus replied that </p><p>police officers have been trained to do so.  However, the </p><p>alien police and immigration officers have been raiding </p><p>brothels and streetwalking zones in their search for illegal </p><p>immigrants, particularly Bulgarian and Nigerian women, </p><p>without adequately checking whether the illegal immigrants </p><p>were actually victims of trafficking.  She noted that </p><p>sometimes these officers overrule the regular police.  To </p><p>improve the identification of victims, the Rapporteur,s </p><p>office has suggested setting up multidisciplinary teams. In a </p><p>later meeting, Secretary General Demmink gave a summary of </p><p>Dutch law enforcement efforts, which he described as "going </p><p>in the right direction,"  including a Ministry of Justice </p><p>interagency Task Force and the new trafficking penalty law </p><p>which goes into effect in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 5. Ambassador Sobel asked Korvinus about possible </p><p>discrimination against foreign victims. Korvinus said that </p><p>the Netherlands, unlike Belgium, has no specific shelters for </p><p>trafficking victims.  TIP victims and victims of household </p><p>violence are put together to give them better police </p><p>protection.  According to Korvinus, there is no </p><p>discrimination against foreign women, but she admitted there </p><p>is an overall capacity shortage.  She noted that TIP victims </p><p>are given three months to consider pressing charges, after </p><p>which they can stay in The Netherlands until the juridical </p><p>process has been completed.  This can take as long as two </p><p>years.  Although victims are given shelter, legal, medical </p><p>and financial assistance, the government does not allow them </p><p>to work.  Korvinus considered this inhumane.  She felt that </p><p>the victims should be offered some sort of legitimate </p><p>employment or training to be able to prepare for a future at </p><p>home. </p><p>(U)  6. A/S Jones also pressed her interlocutors to work </p><p>closely with other countries and through multilateral </p><p>institutions to combat trafficking.  In her meeting with </p><p>Korvinus, A/S Jones noted that the EU needs to focus on TIP </p><p>problems in source countries.  A/S Jones mentioned that the </p><p>U.S. had been pressing the EU Commissioner for External </p><p>Relations, Chris Patten, to focus on the Caucasus and Central </p><p>Asia regions to improve border controls, fight corruption, </p><p>and stimulate prosecution.  She suggested that the EU could </p><p>play a role in the training of law enforcement officers so </p><p>that they can easily recognize TIP victims.  In her meeting </p><p>with Secretary General Demmink, A/S Jones noted that her </p><p>recent visits to countries in Eastern Europe, Moldova in </p><p>particular, indicated to her how "differently and intensely" </p><p>we must work with every country to combat human trafficking. </p><p>She asked about Dutch liaison with source countries for </p><p>victims in the Netherlands and related transit countries and </p><p>pushed for better joint cooperation and investigations.  She </p><p>asked for Dutch support for a new initiative to talk to NATO </p><p>about troops who may be consumers of trafficked prostitutes. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 7. Korvinus remarked that it is not enough to start </p><p>public awareness campaigns in source countries to warn young </p><p>people of the dangers.  It is also very important to educate </p><p>and train young people to improve their chances on the labor </p><p>market and reduce poverty.  Later, Demmink described </p><p>cooperation with source and transit countries as a "mixed </p><p>bag" -- good with countries who are EU candidates or aspire </p><p>to be, not as good with countries like Russia and Moldova and </p><p>not easy with neighbors such as Germany and Austria who give </p><p>trafficking a lower priority.  The Dutch will work on a </p><p>special regional treaty on trafficking in the Council of </p><p>Europe to build on the Palermo Protocol.   The Dutch are also </p><p>encouraging EU and OSCE members to appoint special </p><p>Rapporteurs for trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Counternarcotics Issues and Terrorism Issues </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(U) 8.  A/S Jones raised U.S. concerns about counternarcotics </p><p>with Justice Ministry Secretary General Demmink and with </p><p>senior MFA officials.  A/S Jones asked what measures the </p><p>Dutch were taking to curb Ecstasy production.  MFA officials </p><p>said the Dutch government is committed to finding practical </p><p>areas of cooperation with the U.S. and has cut production. </p><p>Demmink answered that they have stepped up efforts and </p><p>reorganized and centralized their police Ecstasy units.  As </p><p>of July 1, 2003, a new national police operation (National </p><p>Recherche) was set up to fight drug production and </p><p>trafficking on a national level.  Demmink said that National </p><p>Recherche will have a direct link to the National </p><p>Prosecutors, office, which he believes will give them better </p><p>tools to fight drugs. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 9. Ambassador Sobel raised the issue of cocaine </p><p>swallowers.  He noted that the Dutch have no preclearance </p><p>procedures in the Netherlands Antilles and suggested that it </p><p>would be better to stop swallowers from getting on the </p><p>airplane at the source rather than dealing with them at </p><p>Schiphol.  He noted that U.S. Customs had experience with </p><p>preclearance and said that they would be willing to share </p><p>their experiences. Demmink agreed that cocaine swallowers </p><p>from the Caribbean were a major problem for The Netherlands </p><p>and that preclearance was an idea worth considering.  They </p><p>could begin with Aruba -- an island that did not/not have a </p><p>serious drug problem.  If that were to prove successful, </p><p>perhaps they could move on to Curacao in the Dutch Antilles. </p><p> </p><p>Chemical Precursors </p><p> </p><p>(U) 10. A/S Jones raised the issue of precursor chemicals </p><p>coming to the Netherlands from China.  Demmink replied that </p><p>the Dutch Ambassador in Beijing will soon open negotiations </p><p>with the Chinese with the aim of drawing up an MOU.  A/S </p><p>Jones said that the U.S. would be willing to assist should </p><p>that be required. </p><p>Bilateral Follow Up </p><p> </p><p>(U) 11. Ambassador Sobel asked about progress on the Agreed </p><p>Steps from the March 2003 Bilateral.  DDG Ijzerman said that </p><p>things were progressing well and a June 25 meeting had </p><p>clarified several issues.  Both sides would continue to </p><p>follow up on a regular basis.  He also mentioned the recent </p><p>Justice-to-Justice conference at Zutphen as being </p><p>particularly useful in increasing the understanding of both </p><p>sides. </p><p> </p><p>Asset Seizures </p><p> </p><p>(U) 12.  A/S Jones asked Demmink what they were doing on the </p><p>issue of asset seizures.  Demmink said that there is a legal </p><p>framework for this issue but that the difficulty is </p><p>convincing the courts of the proof of linkage between the </p><p>money and the accused.  Marjorie Bonn commented that seizure </p><p>is easy, the problem is confiscation. </p><p> </p><p>Targeting Drug Leadership </p><p> </p><p>(U) 13. DCM Russel noted that The Netherlands should be </p><p>fighting against the major Ecstasy syndicates and not the </p><p>small players.  He suggested that a major campaign conducted </p><p>over a short period of time might have a big effect on the </p><p>market.  Demmink agreed with that strategy, but said that </p><p>there are very few large organizations in the Netherlands - </p><p>most are small groups of operators. </p><p> </p><p>EU Presidency - Law Enforcement Issues </p><p> </p><p>(U) 14. Ambassador Sobel asked what the Netherlands, top </p><p>priorities would be in terms of law enforcement during their </p><p>upcoming EU Presidency in 2004.  DDG Ijzerman noted that with </p><p>25 new members the agenda would have to be very limited.  He </p><p>said that there would be two major law enforcement items on </p><p>the agenda: 1. An EU Action Plan for Illegal Drugs; 2. The </p><p>development of a comprehensive strategy on organized crime. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorism Prosecution </p><p> </p><p>(U) 15.  A/S Jones asked Demmink if prosecution of terrorist </p><p>acts is unnecessarily difficult in the Netherlands as </p><p>indicated by two recent terrorism related cases that were </p><p>dismissed.  Demmink responded that the Ministry of Justice </p><p>was well informed in every stage of those cases that the </p><p>evidence was sometimes thin or based on intelligence that is </p><p>difficult to use for conviction.  He felt that the issues </p><p>raised by these cases were valuable in the process of </p><p>refining counter terrorism laws and policies.  He also talked </p><p>about conspiracy laws that differed in each EU country, </p><p>making an EU arrest warrant difficult.  Similar to </p><p>intelligence information, conspiracy evidence can be used as </p><p>a vehicle for investigation but may not be enough for a </p><p>conviction. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>(U) 16.  MFA Western Hemisphere Director Marion Kappeyne </p><p>complimented President Bush\'s Emergency AIDS Initiative.  She </p><p>said the MFA is committed to cooperating with the U.S. in the </p><p>fight against AIDS and that Dutch and U.S. officials are now </p><p>identifying areas of cooperation in a select group of target </p><p>countries in Africa.  Kappeyne suggested that when possible, </p><p>donor countries should make use of existing mechanisms in </p><p>focus countries, rather than creating new ones.  This </p><p>approach, she said, ensures sustainability.  Rob Swartbol of </p><p>the Prime Minister\'s office said the PM plans to attend the </p><p>AIDS meeting on the margins of the UNGA in September. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
