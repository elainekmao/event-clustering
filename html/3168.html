THE ROLE OF SCIENCE IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY DEBATE IS GROWING, THANKS IN PART TO EMBASSY </p><p>EFFORTS.  IN THE LAST TEN DAYS, TWO DEBATES FEATURING LEADING </p><p>U.S. AND ITALIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WELL COVERED BY THE </p><p>MEDIA AND HAVE THROWN INTO QUESTION THE UNSCIENTIFIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02999  01 OF 05  191328Z </p><p>FOUNDATIONS USED BY AGMIN ALEMANNO TO POSIT HIS "TIME FOR </p><p>CHOICES" WHITE PAPER.  ALEMANNO\'S TEAM IS REGARDED WITH </p><p>SKEPTICISM AND EVEN CONTEMPT BY THE ITALIAN SCIENTIFIC </p><p>COMMUNITY.  AT THE MINISTER\'S JUNE 4 STAGE-MANAGED PUBLIC </p><p>ROLL-OUT OF HIS WHITE PAPER, OUTDATED AND SUPERSEDED RESEARCH </p><p>WAS PRESENTED AS GOSPEL, SECONDED BY A THEOLOGIAN, AND </p><p>COMMENTED ON FROM THE FLOOR BY A PRESELECTED GROUP OF </p><p>PRO-ALEMANNO, ANTI-GMO PROPONENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) SUMMARY CONTINUED.  OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GOI </p><p>APPEAR MORE AND MORE WILLING TO ENDORSE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH </p><p>AS A WAY TO OPPOSE THE ALEMANNO LUDDITES AND THEIR ANTI-GMO </p><p>PROPOSALS. THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, IN ON-THE-RECORD </p><p>ADDRESSES AT THE DG AND U/S LEVELS, ENDORSED THE NEED FOR </p><p>SCIENCE-BASED POLICY, STRONG U.S.-ITALIAN RESEARCH </p><p>COOPERATION, AND USING THAT COOPERATION TO REOPEN A BROADER </p><p>U.S.-EU DIALOGUE DURING THE 2003 ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. THE PM\'S </p><p>NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMMISSION PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN </p><p>SIMILARLY, AND TOLD US WE SHOULD EXPECT ENDORSEMENT OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION DOCUMENT DESCRIBED REF A FROM THE </p><p>PM\'S OFFICE BY THE END OF JUNE.  LAST, BUT BY NO MEANS LEAST, </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER, CONTINUING TO FIND HIS WAY WITH CAUTION, </p><p>HAS SAID THAT ITALY MUST REMAIN OPEN TO RESEARCH, AND LOOK TO </p><p>THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE </p><p>SHOULD NOT FAIL TO EXPLOIT. SEE EMBASSY ANALYSIS STARTING </p><p>PARA 16.END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RAISING THE BAR ON FEAR-MONGERING? </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE ITALIAN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY HAS REMAINED </p><p>STEADFASTLY PRO-BIOTECHNOLOGY, BUT HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02999  01 OF 05  191328Z </p><p>EXPRESS ITS VIEWS DUE TO FEARS OF REPRISALS FROM </p><p>GOVERNMENT(E.G. DISCRIMINATORY CUTBACKS IN ALREADY SCARCE </p><p>RESEARCH FUNDING) AND ACTIONS BY ANTI-GMO GROUPS WHO HAVE </p><p>DISRUPTED OR DESTROYED EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING GMO PLANTS AT A </p><p>RESEARCH PLOT NEAR VITERBO AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO.  IN </p><p>THE FIRST DAYS OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT, THERE WAS HOPE </p><p>THAT A PRO-SCIENCE, PRO-BUSINESS GOVERNMENT WOULD ACT QUICKLY </p><p>TO OPEN THE WAY FOR RESUMED BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH.  IN THE </p><p>LAST SIX MONTHS, AS THE CONTOURS OF ALEMANNO\'S ANTI-BIOTECH </p><p>POLICIES HAVE BECOME CLEARER, THAT HOPE HAS FADED. </p><p>SCIENTISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT THE PRIME MINISTER ALONE CAN </p><p>OPPOSE ALEMANNO\'S PROPOSED POLICY, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO </p><p>HELP EXPOSE THE SHABBY SCIENTIFIC UNDERPINNINGS OF THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER\'S WHITE PAPER BY CONDUCTING THEIR OWN </p><p>PROGRAMS WHICH SHOW THE BENEFITS OF THE TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THE SCIENTISTS ARE ASSISTED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO </p><p>CREATE A PUBLIC FOR THEIR DISCUSSIONS BY A HANDFUL OF </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  PROMINENT AMONG THEM HAS BEEN THE EINAUDI </p><p>FOUNDATION, WHOSE "OBSERVATORY FOR BIOETHICS" HAS SPONSORED A </p><p>NUMBER OF PRO-BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN THE LAST YEAR.  MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, ON MAY 31 AND JUNE 1, THE EINAUDI FOUNDATION </p><p>ORGANIZED A TWO DAY PROGRAM ON PLANT VACCINES AND ENHANCING </p><p>NUTRITION IN FOODS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY.

DR. CHARLES ARNTZEN OF ARIZONA STATE </p><p>UNIVERSITY, SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE EMBASSY, WAS THE MAIN </p><p>U.S. SPEAKER.  DR. INGO POTRYKUS, INVENTOR OF GOLDEN RICE, </p><p>LED THE NUTRITIONAL ENHANCEMENT DISCUSSIONS.  THE MAIN TALKS </p><p>WERE BROADCAST ON RADIO RADIKALE, AND LOCAL MEDIA AND PRESS </p><p>INTERVIEWED DR. ARNTZEN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE WORKSHOP WAS OPENED BY THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT(DG CLINI, WHO HAD TOLD US THE PREVIOUS DAY THAT </p><p>THE MINISTER HAD AGREED TO EXPLORE A MORE OPEN APPROACH TO </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY). THE BRIEF STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT EUROPE </p><p>WAS NOT, AND COULD NOT BE, GM FREE, THAT RESEARCH, INCLUDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02999  02 OF 05  191328Z </p><p>STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U.S, WAS ESSENTIAL TO </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND THAT ITALY </p><p>HAD TO TAKE POLICY DECISIONS IN A EUROPEAN AND LARGER </p><p>CONTEXT.  EST COUNS SPOKE ON THE NEED FOR POSITIVE </p><p>STEWARDSHIP IN POLICY FORMULATION WITH PARTICULAR NEED TO </p><p>SEPARATE EMOTIONAL SPECULATION AND OPINION POLLS FROM THE </p><p>VERIFIABLE AND SYSTEMATIC INQUIRIES OF SCIENCE. LEONARDI </p><p>SANTI, PRESIDENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S COMMITTEE ON </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, SAID THAT ITALY WOULD SOON CONCLUDE AN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON RESEARCH WITH THE U.K. AND THAT THE PM\'S OFFICE </p><p>STRONGLY SUPPORTED A RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) ARNTZEN AND POTRYKUS WERE THE MOST EFFECTIVE </p><p>SPEAKERS. ARNTZEN OUTLINED RESEARCH WHICH PROMISED AN EDIBLE </p><p>PLANT-BASED VACCINE FOR HEPATITIS B WITHIN 5 YEARS.  POTRYKUS </p><p>DELIVERED A CHILLING CRITICISM OF THE EU REGULATORY SYSTEM </p><p>THAT WAS HAMPERING THE DISSEMINATION OF GOLDEN RICE AND OTHER </p><p>NUTRITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS, SUCH AS IRON, WHICH HE CLAIMED </p><p>COULD SAVE UP TO 40,000 LIVES A DAY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ON JUNE 6, ASSOBIOTECH, THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION,  PRESENTED A HALF-DAY PROGRAM TO PRESENT A STUDY </p><p>OF ITALIAN "TYPICAL" PRODUCTS AT RISK FROM PESTS AND DISEASES </p><p>WHICH COULD BE IMPROVED BY BIOTECHNOLOGIES.  PROFESSOR </p><p>FRANCESCO SALA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MILAN INTRODUCED THE </p><p>STUDY, AND HIS PRESENTATION WAS SUPPORTED BY OTHER </p><p>SCIENTISTS, WHOSE REMARKS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SHOUTS OF </p><p>ABOUT A DOZEN LEGAMBIENTE (ITALY\'S MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL NGO) </p><p>PROTESTORS FROM THE STREET BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02999  02 OF 05  191328Z </p><p>10.  (SBU) IMPORTANT REMARKS WERE MADE BY MINISTRY OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT U/S TORTOLI, WHO PLACED BIOTECHNOLOGIES IN </p><p>AGRICULTURE IN A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT, SPOKE IN </p><p>FAVOR OF U.S.-ITALY RESEARCH COOPERATION, A EUROPEAN NETWORK </p><p>(AN IDEA PRESENTED A FEW DAYS EARLIER TO EST COUNS BY FORZA </p><p>ITALIA SCIENCE ADVISOR ARATA), AND THE KEY ROLE ITALY COULD </p><p>PLAY IN ITS 2003 EU PRESIDENCY. COMMENT: TORTOLI\'S SPEECH WAS </p><p>DRAFTED BY DG CLINI FOR THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT. </p><p>ASSOBIOTECH HAD SEEN AN EARLIER DRAFT OF THE SPEECH, AND </p><p>ADVISED TORTOLI TO BE CAREFUL. HE WAS NOT, WHICH WE ASSUME </p><p>REFLECTS A DECISION BY MIN OF ENVIRONMENT MATTEOLI TO MOVE </p><p>MORE OPENLY IN OPPOSITION TO ALEMANNO\'S MORE NATIONALISTIC </p><p>POSITION.

OPENLY CRITICAL OF ALEMANNO\'S POSITIONS, RONCONI </p><p>CALLED FOR A POLICY OF REALISM, FOUNDED ON SCIENCE.  HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT GM FREE AGRICULTURE DID NOT EXIST IN ITALY NOW, </p><p>THAT GMO FREE SEEDS WERE NOT AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT </p><p>QUANTITIES, AND THAT A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WOULD NOT </p><p>BENEFIT, BUT WOULD DAMAGE SMALL FARMERS WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY </p><p>A PREMIUM PRICE FOR SEEDS UNDER THE ALEMANNO POLICY.

HE DID NOT OBJECT </p><p>TO BEING COMPARED BY THE AUDIENCE TO FORMER GREEN PARTY AG </p><p>MINISTER PECORARO SCANIO, AND SAID HE WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE </p><p>INVESTORS IN AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) COMMENT: REACTION TO ALEMANNO FROM THOSE ATTENDING </p><p>WAS CONSIDERED DISMAY.  MOST FOUND A SILVER LINING IN THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S REFUSAL TO CLOSE ITALY TO BIOTECHNOLOGY, </p><p>ANNOUNCED IN BRIEF REMARKS AT THE JUNE 4 TAVOLA </p><p>AGRIALIMENTARE IN THE PRESENCE OF ALEMMANO, BUT MANY </p><p>CONCLUDED NO REAL DECISION WOULD BE TAKEN ON POLICY UNLESS </p><p>ALEMANNO MOVED TO A DIFFERENT POSITION IN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>ASSOBIOTECH PRESIDENT SERGIO DOMPE TOLD ESTCOUNS HE BELIEVES </p><p>THAT BERLUSCONI WILL MOVE FORWARD, BUT WILL BE IN NO HURRY. </p><p>THE GAME PLAN SEEMS TO BE CONTAINED REACTION TO ALEMANNO, NOT </p><p>INITIATIVE BY THE PM.

(U) ON JUNE 4, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO WORKSHOPS </p><p>DESCRIBED ABOVE, ALEMANNO CONDUCTED HIS OWN "SCIENTIFIC </p><p>PROGRAM" AT LA SAPIENZA(UNIVERSITY OF ROME), WHERE HE DEBUTED </p><p>PUBLICLY HIS WHITE PAPER TO AN AUDIENCE OF ABOUT 300. THERE </p><p>WAS VIRTUALLY NO OVERLAP BETWEEN THE AUDIENCES ATTENDING THE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOPS REPORTED ABOVE AND THE AUDIENCE </p><p>ATTENDING THE ALEMANNO PROGRAM.

WHEN ALEMANNO </p><p>TOOK THE STAGE FOR WHAT BECAME A HALF-HOUR BARBURNER OF A </p><p>SPEECH, HE PROCLAIMED THAT HE HAD HELED THE DIVIDE BETWEEN </p><p>SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENALISTS/FARMERS/CONSUMERS, AND THAT </p><p>HIS POLICY PROPOSAL, SOON TO BE INFORMED BY THE WORK OF A </p><p>MULTIDISCIPLINARY TASK FORCE, WOULD INTRODUCE INTO THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT A DEBATE TO HELP ITALY MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE ABOUT </p><p>GMOS.
