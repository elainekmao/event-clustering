<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 09970 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, INR/B AND INR/DB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, PREL, PGOV, SO </p><p>SUBJ:  BIOGRAPHIC REPORTING:  ABDIRAHMAN ABDULLE OSMAN </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SOMALIA\'S CURRENT MINISTER OF PLAN WAS BORN ABOUT </p><p>55 YEARS AGO IN GAROE IN NORTHERN SOMALIA.  A MAJERTIAN, </p><p>HE CAME TO MOGADISHU AT THE AGE OF 17.  HE WAS TRAINED </p><p>TO BE A TEACHER, FIRST IN SOMALIA AND THEN IN ITALY. </p><p>LATER HE PICKED UP MASTER\'S DEGREES IN INDIA AND AT </p><p>REDDING UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.  AS HE MOVED </p><p>UP THE BUREAUCRATIC LADDER AT THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, </p><p>HE ALSO TOOK SHORT COURSES ABROAD, INCLUDING ONE IN </p><p>PROJECT EVALUATION AT THE WORLD BANK\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE.  IN 1986, HE LEFT HIS HOME MINISTRY </p><p>AFTER SERVING FOURYEARS AS MINISTER WHEN NAMED SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY.  HE WAS APPOINTED TO </p><p>HIS CURRENT POST EARLIER THIS YEAR.  THE MINISTER TOURED </p><p>THE U.S. ON A USIS GRANT IN 1988, ATTENDING AND ENJOYING </p><p>THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN ATLANTA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A LENGTHY BUT THOUGHTFUL AND WELL ORGANIZED </p><p>DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL SCENE DURING MY </p><p>COURTESY CALL NOVEMBER 6, THE MINISTER STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS A CIVILIAN ONE.  IN LANGUAGE AND </p><p>TONE SUGGESTING HE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK </p><p>WITH "RIGID" MILITARY OFFICERS, OSMAN WAS CRITICAL OF </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL.  HIS </p><p>ANALYSIS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFICULTY TRYING TO </p><p>INSTILL DEMOCRACY IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH 60 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION IS UNDER 25 YEARS OLD AND THUS HAS NO MEMORY </p><p>OR, OR EXPERIENCE WITH, REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.  HE </p><p>SAID THE REGIME PLANS TO SEND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET INTO </p><p>THE COUNTRYSIDE TO TRY TO EDUCATE THE POPULATION TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PROCEDURES (COMMENT - GIVEN THE </p><p>DEGREE OF INSECURITY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IT IS DOUBTFUL </p><p>MANY MINISTERS WILL VENTURE THERE). </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE MINISTER DESCRIBED AS IRONIC HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO </p><p>PLAN AN ECONOMY WITHOUT RESOURCES.  HE POLITELY CRITICIZED </p><p>THE USG FOR WITHDRAWING ITS SUPPORT, JUST AS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BEGINS A PROGRAM OF POLITICAL REFORM.  HE ALSO </p><p>CLAIMED THAT OTHER DONORS ARE TAKING THEIR CUE FROM THE </p><p>USG AND PACKING UP.  WHEN I COUNTERED THAT REFORM IS A </p><p>VERY RECENT PHENOMENON AND THAT OTHER DONORS ARE CUTTING </p><p>BACK THEIR ACTIVITIES DUE TO INSECURITY, INCLUDING DIS- </p><p>ORDERLY AND OCCASIONALLY DEADLY MISBEHAVIOR BY GOVERNMENT </p><p>TROOPS, HE GAVE ME NO ARGUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  LIKE MANY TEACHERS, OSMAN APPEARS TO ENJOY </p><p>THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE.  BUT HE IS BRIGHT AND </p><p>ARTICULATE.  JUDGING ONLY BY THE CONDUCT OF SEVERAL </p><p>YOUNGER CABINET MEMBERS WHO WERE WITH HIM WHEN WE FIRST </p><p>MET ON A CEREMONIAL OCCASION, HE APPEARS TO ENJOY SOME </p><p>RESPECT AMONG HIS PEERS. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
