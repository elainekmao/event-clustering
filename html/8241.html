<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL/AAE-EFLOOD, AF/W AND PM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PGOV, EAID, NI, MMAR </p><p>SUBJECT:  RNLEO MEETING WITH ICPC CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. RNLEO met with the Chairman of the Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC), </p><p>Justice Mustapha Akanbi, on May 20 to discuss the status of </p><p>the ICPC in light of the recent actions by the National </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Justice Akanbi told RNLEO that he has been working from </p><p>his home to avoid a conflict with the court that ordered </p><p>all parties to maintain the status quo in response to a law </p><p>suit filed by several legislators seeking to overturn the </p><p>newly enacted 2003 Anti-Corruption Law.  Akanbi noted that </p><p>press coverage indicating that the President vetoed the new </p><p>legislation was not accurate.  He explained that the </p><p>President was complying with the court order to "maintain </p><p>the status quo" until the court had time to rule on the </p><p>merit of the lawsuit against the National Assembly </p><p>leadership.  Justice Akanbi stated that he did not want to </p><p>appear to be doing anything contrary to the court order. </p><p>Therefore, he was working from his home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Akanbi stated, until the matter is settled by the court, </p><p>ICPC cannot investigate nor arrest.  In fact, to avoid </p><p>problems for his staff, they occasionally meet at his home </p><p>to get instructions and guidance for their daily </p><p>responsibilities.  The major issue is whether the court has </p><p>jurisdiction over a case involving laws passed by the </p><p>National Assembly or not.  Akanbi said that the Chief Judge </p><p>of the Federal High Court came to Abuja from Lagos to hear </p><p>the case personally.  The next hearing is on Thursday and </p><p>all parties have been given strict instructions leading </p><p>Akanbi to believe that the matter could be settled in the </p><p>next two to three weeks. (Note: During proceedings on May </p><p>19, the court rejected the Governments motion to set aside </p><p>the new amendment but scheduled further hearings for May 22. </p><p>(End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Justice Akanbi stated that the President was very </p><p>worried over this issue and feared that Akanbi would </p><p>resign.  He said the President prevailed upon him not to </p><p>resign because of the signal it may send to the nation and </p><p>the international community.  Akanbi assured RNLEO that he </p><p>plans to keep working until the matter is resolved.  He </p><p>expressed confidence that the case would be settled in </p><p>favor of the original Anti-Corruption Act because the </p><p>attorney handling the case for the Presidency is the same </p><p>attorney that handled the ICPC constitutionality case and </p><p>won. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Akanbi observed that only the Minister of Transport </p><p>expressed public support for the ICPC.  He said that if the </p><p>courts rule in favor of the ICPC, he plans to run a program </p><p>to educate the public about the differences in the Anti- </p><p>Corruption Act of 2000 and the recently passed bill. </p><p>On one specific element of the new law, Justice Akanbi </p><p>stated that he could not imagine a serving judge on the </p><p>Appellate Court who would accept an appointment to the </p><p>Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Akanbi also asked about the U.S. position on the events </p><p>surrounding the ICPC.  RNLEO reiterated the position taken </p><p>by the Ambassador in a previous meeting that the U.S. could </p><p>not support the ICPC as proposed by the law recently passed </p><p>by the National Assembly because it was clearly designed to </p><p>further the goals of a few corrupt legislators.  In addition, </p><p>RNLEO advised Justice Akanbi that the ICPC assistance package </p><p>from OPDAT, signed in March 2003 was designed for the Commission </p><p>as formed by the Anti-Corruption Act of 2000 and could not </p><p>proceed until it is clear that the integrity of the </p><p>Commission is assured.  Justice Akanbi understood and </p><p>agreed saying, he too could not serve on a Commission as </p><p>proposed by the new law either. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. The fate of the ICPC should become clearer after the </p><p>hearing on May 22, and will be reported SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
