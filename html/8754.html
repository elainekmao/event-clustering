<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001052 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-16-13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 90  (06-16-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador E.Ashley Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MFA REQUEST RE IRAQ </p><p>-          AMBASSADOR MEETS PRESIDENT ONE LAST TIME </p><p> </p><p>MFA REQUEST RE IRAQ </p><p>------------------- </p><p>1.  (SBU) URGENT:  MFA Foreign Secretary Nihal Rodrigo </p><p>sent us a fax today (June 16) confirming that Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>ambassador to Iraq, M.M.A. Farouque, plans to return to </p><p>Baghdad at some point this week.  (Note:  Farouque is now </p><p>in Sri Lanka.  By the way, we have already passed the MFA </p><p>the info re diplomats in Iraq contained in State 163526, </p><p>dated June 14).  The MFA had two urgent requests: </p><p> </p><p>-- The MFA would like for Farouque to be able to touch </p><p>base with the U.S. ambassador to Jordan at some point </p><p>this week (re the Amman-Baghdad road, and associated </p><p>logistics and other arrangements, etc.).  Please check </p><p>with NEA and ask whether we can provide Ambassador </p><p>Farouque an appropriately high-level contact (ambassador, </p><p>DCM, etc.) at Embassy Amman that he can discuss such </p><p>issues with.  Phone numbers would be helpful, too. </p><p> </p><p>-- The MFA wants to set up an appointment for Farouque </p><p>with Ambassador Bremer in Baghdad as soon as feasible. </p><p>Please advise us how to answer this request. </p><p> </p><p>We would appreciate anything that we can pass to the MFA </p><p>as soon as possible, given that Farouque seems to be </p><p>leaving shortly.  Thank you.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR MEETS PRESIDENT ONE LAST TIME </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) Before departing Sri Lanka early tomorrow (June </p><p>17), Ambassador Wills met with President Kumaratunga one </p><p>last time on June 13.  Kumaratunga asked about the peace </p><p>process.  The Ambassador remarked that it was at a </p><p>turning point, with much depending on how the Tigers </p><p>reacted from here on out.  Kumaratunga then asked whether </p><p>the USG would assist Sri Lanka if the Tigers re-commenced </p><p>hostilities.  The Ambassador noted that that was a </p><p>hypothetical.  It was almost certainly the case, however, </p><p>that the international community would be deeply </p><p>concerned and would carefully monitor the situation.  Re </p><p>cohabitation, the president placed all the blame on the </p><p>PM and the government.  The Ambassador demurred on that, </p><p>noting that both sides had a role in the problems and had </p><p>roles in clearing things up.  Kumaratunga backed up, </p><p>claiming that she was at most "25 percent" in the wrong. </p><p>(POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
