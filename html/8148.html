Major English and vernacular </p><p>newspapers headlined her remarks regarding cohabitation and </p><p>encouraging the LTTE to attend the Tokyo donor conference. </p><p>English editorial comment was muted and focused on </p><p>cohabitation and sovereignty issues.  Tamil editorial </p><p>reaction was more robust and for the most part agreed with </p><p>Ms. Rocca\'s comments regarding cohabitation.  Sinhala </p><p>editorialists remained silent. </p><p>A transcript of Rocca\'s May 13 Colombo press conference was </p><p>picked up by the Washington File, and was also distributed </p><p>to the English and vernacular Sri Lankan press.  In India, </p><p>the transcript was distributed to Tamil Nadu media outlets. </p><p>India\'s English Sun-TV and Tamil channels carried clips of </p><p>Ms. Rocca\'s briefing.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2.  Television. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>English, Sinhala and Tamil television coverage of Rocca\'s </p><p>visit was extensive. Independent and government-owned </p><p>television stations heralded both her arrival on May 11 and </p><p>her meetings with the President, Prime Minister and the </p><p>Foreign Minister on May 12.   On May 13, post hosted a </p><p>press conference for Rocca, which was aired by independent </p><p>and government-owned television stations on lunchtime and </p><p>evening newscasts in and English and vernacular broadcasts. </p><p> </p><p>Indian English Sun-TV and Indian Tamil channels carried </p><p>clips of Ms. Rocca\'s briefing. </p><p> </p><p> ----- </p><p>3.  Headlines. </p><p>------ </p><p>Throughout Rocca\'s visit, major English and vernacular </p><p>newspapers focused on her comments regarding cohabitation </p><p>and the LTTE\'s attendance at the Tokyo donor conference. </p><p>Independent English DAILY MIRROR headlined (5/15), "US </p><p>tells UNF and PA to come together." Government -owned </p><p>English DAILY NEWS wrote (5/14), "Act in unity to achieve </p><p>peace - Rocca," and (5/15), "Rocca lauds Lankan peace </p><p>process: US urges LTTE to go to Tokyo." Opposition Sinhala </p><p>daily, DIVAINA led with (5/14), " `In order to make the </p><p>peace process happen, all political parties get together\' </p><p>announces America."  Independent Tamil VIRAKESARI reported </p><p>(5/15), "\'LTTE should definitely attend the Tokyo </p><p>Conference- Cohabitation between President and Prime </p><p>Minister necessary\' - says Christina Rocca." </p><p> </p><p>Regarding her 5/12 meeting with President Kumaratunga, </p><p>independent English DAILY MIRROR (5/14) reported, "CBK </p><p>complains to US against LTTE and govt. " This was echoed by </p><p>opposition Sinhala daily DIVAINA (5/15), "Christina Rocca </p><p>is informed of MOU violations of LTTE. "  The Tamil press </p><p>was predictably silent. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  English editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p>English editorial comment was muted and focused on </p><p>cohabitation and sovereignty issues. </p><p>---- Under the headline, "The spirit of Vesak and the </p><p>spirit of the constitution," opposition English daily </p><p>ISLAND (5/15) warned, ".foreign donors .consider co- </p><p>habitation quarrels will eclipse peace negotiations." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p>"While Sri Lankans and the world outside hoped that some </p><p>form of compromise could be reached between the prime </p><p>minister and president over an issue that is not as </p><p>contentious as many other issues before them, the </p><p>president\'s resounding reply (my decision remains unchanged </p><p>and valid) has dashed hopes of a settlement and deepened </p><p>the political crisis. </p><p>"At yesterday\'s press briefing by America\'s key official to </p><p>the South Asian region, Assistant Secretary of State </p><p>Christina Rocca, she spoke of two challenges that are </p><p>particularly worrying: `One the possibility that the LTTE </p><p>may ignore the donor conference in Tokyo; two the </p><p>possibility that cohabitation quarrels will eclipse peace </p><p>talk deliberations\'. The reference made to is quite obvious </p><p>and if the president pursues with her intended moves it </p><p>could well lead to paralysis of government, dissolution of </p><p>parliament and threaten the `Peace Process\'. </p><p>"Despite President Kumaratunga\'s cavalier dismissal of </p><p>charges of jeopardising the `Peace Process\', as pointed out </p><p>earlier in our comments, foreign donors do consider co- </p><p>habitation quarrels will eclipse peace negotiations. Indeed </p><p>even before the lotteries board issue, there were far </p><p>greater co- habitation issues that had to be resolved if </p><p>peace was to come about. But if this seemingly less </p><p>innocuous issue is to take us further down into the mire, </p><p>it will probably take this `Peace Process\' along with it." </p><p> </p><p>---- Under the headline, "Erosion of sovereignty," </p><p>independent English DAILY MIRROR commented (5/16), "But for </p><p>our head of state. to obsequiously place her domestic </p><p>problems before a visiting representative of another </p><p>sovereign state, is .tantamount not only to putting the </p><p>country\'s sovereignty to ridicule but to bringing disgrace </p><p>to the honour and dignity of the office she holds." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"The extent of the erosion of our country\'s sovereignty </p><p>could be judged from the fact that it has become necessary </p><p>for our head of state to complain to an outsider against </p><p>the government\'s alleged harassment of her party activists </p><p>and supporters and about other domestic problems. </p><p>"The President has lodged this complaint about the LTTE\'s </p><p>ceasefire violations and about 3,000 incidents of assault, </p><p>arson and battery against PA activists and supporters </p><p>following the December 2001 general election and regarding </p><p>police inaction over these incidents, when US Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State Christina Rocca met the President on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Tuesday. </p><p>"It would indeed be a different matter if these parties </p><p>took their woes and disputes to international institutions </p><p>specifically set up for the resolution of such conflicts. </p><p>But for our head of state who wields extensive executive </p><p>powers, to obsequiously place her domestic problems before </p><p>a visiting representative of another sovereign state, is </p><p>certainly tantamount not only to putting the country\'s </p><p>sovereignty to ridicule but to bringing disgrace to the </p><p>honour and dignity of the office she holds." </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  Vernacular editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p>Tamil editorial comment was more robust.  For the most </p><p>part, Tamil editorials incorporated Ms. Rocca\'s remarks </p><p>into their own editorial messages, encouraging the </p><p>government to overcome its cohabitation problems.  Sinhala </p><p>editorialists remained silent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- Under the headline, "Christina Rocca\'s timely </p><p>expressions,"  independent Tamil daily, THINAKKURAL </p><p>commented (5/15) that "...The government, opposition, </p><p>President and the Liberation Tigers should take note of the </p><p>views expressed by . Rocca at a time when the peace process </p><p>is facing many challenges."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"...The government, opposition, President and the </p><p>Liberation Tigers should take note of the views expressed </p><p>by the US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian </p><p>Affairs Christina Rocca at a time when the peace process is </p><p>facing many challenges. </p><p> </p><p>"Tiger participation at the Tokyo Aid Conference is </p><p>uncertain. At the same time a new political crisis between </p><p>the President and the Prime Minister has emerged. </p><p> </p><p>"These two issues may bring an end to national peace. The </p><p>political forces should get together and put an end to such </p><p>disputes. </p><p> </p><p>"Christina Rocca has said that it is important that the </p><p>political forces apply the correct approach and settle </p><p>these two issues if Sri Lanka is to prosper in the future </p><p>within a peaceful environment. All those trying to show </p><p>their muzzles should bear this in mind." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- Under the headline, "Disputes and Aid," Independent </p><p>Tamil daily, VIRAKESARI (5/16) echoed Rocca\'s comments and </p><p>wrote: "If all these parties fail to raise a common voice </p><p>the full quota of the anticipated aid may not reach Sri </p><p>Lanka."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"American voice is again heard that Sri Lanka should take </p><p>care of the peace talks to achieve lasting peace. The US </p><p>Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Ms. Christina </p><p>Rocca has made this comment. </p><p> </p><p>"Her voice at this stage, when the talks are faced with </p><p>many obstacles, is a request to the President, Prime </p><p>Minister and the Tigers to pay attention and proceed in the </p><p>right direction. ... </p><p>"... While commenting that the recent actions of the </p><p>President and the use of her executive powers are connected </p><p>to internal affairs of Sri Lanka, she said that the </p><p>international community is very much interested regarding </p><p>solution to the Sri Lankan ethnic problem and lasting peace </p><p>in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>"The US government has always said that the participation </p><p>of the President at the peace talks is very vital. This has </p><p>been stressed this time too. She has stressed that the </p><p>President and the Prime minister should solve the disputes </p><p>between them amicably and should work together to find a </p><p>solution to the ethnic problem. </p><p> </p><p>"The Aid Conference to be held in Tokyo, Japan in June is </p><p>very important to the government, President, Tigers and the </p><p>citizens of Sri Lanka. If all these parties fail to raise a </p><p>common voice the full quota of the anticipated aid may not </p><p>reach Sri Lanka." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> ---- Under the headline, "Executive powers that challenge </p><p>cohabitation," Independent Tamil daily, THINAKKURAL </p><p>comments (5/16), "The chances of bringing a solution to </p><p>this problem is far away."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The government sources, international facilitators and the </p><p>local political forces working for peace are trying their </p><p>level best to solve the political crisis between Liberation </p><p>Tigers and the Sri Lankan government enabling the Tigers to </p><p>continue with peace talks and attend the Tokyo Aid </p><p>Conference. The chances of bringing a solution to this </p><p>problem is far away. </p><p> </p><p>US Assistant Secretary for South Asia Christina Rocca </p><p>clearly said "should not allow the peace talks with </p><p>Liberation Tigers to break up and that is the advice the US </p><p>government can offer" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- Under the headline, "A good omen," independent Tamil </p><p>daily, SUDAR OLI commented (5/16): Finally [the US] has </p><p>understood that whenever the government wants to fulfill </p><p>the aspirations of the Tamils the racists in the opposition </p><p>always try to stop such a move."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Although many of them are customary statements as the </p><p>international policeman, one of here views show that the US </p><p>has understood something they refused to understand in the </p><p>past. </p><p> </p><p>"The ethnic problem in Sri Lanka has along history of more </p><p>than five decades. During that period many Tamil leaders </p><p>wanted to find solutions for their problems in a peaceful </p><p>manner. But every time they tried to win the rights of the </p><p>Tamil people, the Sinhalese leaders who were in power </p><p>fooled them." </p><p> </p><p>"When the Tamil people became convinced that their demands </p><p>could not be won through peaceful negotiations, they had to </p><p>start an armed struggle." </p><p> </p><p>"All this time, the US government did not understand or </p><p>rather did not want to understand the basic reasons for the </p><p>armed struggle of the Tamils. Finally they have understood </p><p>that whenever the government wants to fulfill the </p><p>aspirations of the Tamils the racists in the opposition </p><p>always try to stop such a move." </p><p> </p><p>"... Therefore she has warned the President and the Prime </p><p>Minister not to allow the peace talks to break off." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
