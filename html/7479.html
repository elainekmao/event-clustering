<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000659 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INL/AAE, INL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PREL, PGOV, CE, OEXC - Exchanges </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  FY-2005 INL project proposal -- </p><p>Standardization of Training, Assignment, and Transitions </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 79601 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Classified e-mail INL/AAE-Colombo 4-02-03 </p><p>-      (C) 02 State 228302 </p><p>-      (D) 02 Colombo 2138 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Per Ref A, Mission\'s FY-2005 INL project proposal </p><p>for Sri Lanka follows in Para two.  The goal of the </p><p>project is to establish a means by which Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>police can identify the talents of their officers and </p><p>most effectively make them operational.  The paragraphs </p><p>below are keyed to the instructions in Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>I -- PROGRAM SUMMARY:  Sri Lankan police forces are in a </p><p>period of transition and the means by which they assign </p><p>new recruits to specific police bureaus has become </p><p>outdated.  During a twenty-year conflict with the </p><p>terrorist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the police </p><p>were often called upon to operate in a military </p><p>capacity.  Training and daily operations were thus </p><p>focused on combating an armed insurgency and only a </p><p>limited number of personnel were committed to anti-crime </p><p>and counternarcotics efforts.  During a recent </p><p>assessment of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB), </p><p>representatives from the International Criminal </p><p>Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) of </p><p>the Department of Justice noted that an area in which </p><p>the PNB was being hampered was its inability to identify </p><p>which officers were suited for counternarcotics work. </p><p>(Note:  This PNB problem was outside of the scope of the </p><p>ongoing ICITAP project.)  On review, this difficulty is </p><p>common throughout the police.  The final stages of </p><p>training, the assignment process, and the means by which </p><p>officers are taken into their bureaus appear haphazard </p><p>at best.  To address this issue Mission proposes the </p><p>following project. </p><p> </p><p>II -- PROJECT DESCRIPTION </p><p> </p><p>A - Project Title:  Training:  Skills Assessment and </p><p>Identification </p><p> </p><p>B - Project Description:  The goal of the project is to </p><p>establish a means by which Sri Lanka\'s police can </p><p>identify the talents of their officers during training, </p><p>assign them to bureaus suited to their strengths, and </p><p>then provide guidance on how to integrate the officers </p><p>into bureaus.  The majority of the police force and the </p><p>direct political leadership of the force are aware of </p><p>the numerous difficulties the police are facing and are </p><p>eager to implement changes.  Making the transition from </p><p>a counterinsurgency to a police force is proving </p><p>difficult, however, and the government is seeking </p><p>support in improving its police capabilities.  The </p><p>project would proceed in three phases:  first, an </p><p>assessment of the current training cycle and transition </p><p>to first assignments; second, development and </p><p>implementation of standardized procedures on how to </p><p>determine which officers are assigned where; third, </p><p>development and implementation of standardized </p><p>procedures for inprocessing of new officers into the PNB </p><p>(to include specialized training as needed). </p><p> </p><p>C - Resources Requested (in 1,000\'s):  Mission requests </p><p>USD 300 anti-crime funding for this program.  The </p><p>assessment stage will be funded at USD 20.  SOP on </p><p>distribution of assignments should be funded at USD 150. </p><p>Funding for the in-processing and identification of </p><p>specialized training for the PNB will be USD 130. </p><p> </p><p>D - Resource Justification:  Mission is addressing two </p><p>inter-related issues through this program.  First, there </p><p>is a concern regarding possible transshipment of </p><p>narcotics through Sri Lanka.  Mission has identified a </p><p>number of difficulties in counternarcotic efforts in Sri </p><p>Lanka and has noted ways to improve those efforts, so </p><p>that interdiction can be upgraded.  In addition, while </p><p>implementing the ICITAP project mention above (see Ref </p><p>C) it became apparent that the PNB was hampered by the </p><p>haphazard assignment process and the lack of an </p><p>appropriate inprocessing procedure for its new officers. </p><p>The second aspect of the project focuses on the police </p><p>training in a broader scope.  Mission relies on the host </p><p>government for cooperation in a number of cases and has </p><p>found that although the police are willing to assist, </p><p>its capabilities are sometimes limited.  Some of the </p><p>limits can be traced back to the initial training and </p><p>assignment process.  Paying particular attention to this </p><p>aspect of the training cycle thus enhances current </p><p>programs with the PNB (Ref C) and lays a foundation for </p><p>programs with other bureaus in the police.  Working with </p><p>the PNB on the third part of the program, will enhance a </p><p>strong relationship with an organization that has </p><p>already proven itself very open to USG recommendations. </p><p>It is also a natural follow on to the management review </p><p>proposal submitted in Ref D. </p><p>E - Performance Measurements:  Initial performance </p><p>measurements will rely on arrest rates and crime </p><p>statistics, including narcotics interdiction.  On a </p><p>longer-term basis, the police\'s ability to respond </p><p>positively and in a timely manner to USG requests will </p><p>be continuously reviewed.  With documented operating </p><p>procedures, Mission will also be able to review how </p><p>closely the police are following any recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>F - Sustainability:  Institutionalizing assignment </p><p>procedures and drafting of a standard operating </p><p>procedure will establish self-sustaining operations. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Minimized considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
