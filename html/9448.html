<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PHUM, KISL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW PARLIAMENT MEETS, ELECTS SPEAKER; ISLAMIST </p><p>MEMBERS CAUSE A STIR OVER OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE KING </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4246 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>LOWER AND UPPER HOUSES MEET IN SPECIAL SESSION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  The Jordanian Chamber of Deputies (Lower House of </p><p>the Parliament), elected on June 17, held its first special </p><p>session July 16 and elected Saad Hayel Srour as President </p><p>(i.e. Speaker) of the house.  Srour, who was speaker of the </p><p>Lower House from 1993-97, received 65 of the 110 votes. </p><p>Immediate past Speaker Abdul Hadi Majali received 40 votes. </p><p>The appointed 40-member Chamber of Notables (Upper House or </p><p>Senate) also began a concurrent special session without a </p><p>significant change of leadership.  Zaid Rifai continues as </p><p>Speaker of the Senate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>IAF CAUSES A STIR IN TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  A minor row developed at the beginning of the Lower </p><p>House session when the MPs took the oath of office.   The new </p><p>MPs from the Islamic Action Front (IAF) refused to take the </p><p>standard oath pledging allegiance to the King, instead </p><p>swearing allegiance to the King as long as he remains a pious </p><p>Muslim.  "We link obedience to a ruler as long as his edicts </p><p>satisfy God and attain the interests of his subjects," IAF </p><p>Secretary General Hamzah Mansour declared later to the press. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> Many members of the House -- dominated by pro-Monarchy and </p><p>conservative tribal MPs -- objected loudly to the IAF\'s move. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Srour is well and favorably known to the Embassy. </p><p>His management of the Parliamentary review and approval of </p><p>the more than 200 "temporary laws" promulgated by the </p><p>government in the absence of Parliament -- many developed </p><p>with U.S. technical assistance -- will be key to cementing </p><p>the King\'s economic reform program.  The IAF-caused row over </p><p>the oath of office may indicate that the IAF -- which is </p><p>heavily outnumbered and unlikely to be able to defeat </p><p>government proposed legislation in a vote -- may be willing </p><p>to break a little crockery on the floor of the Parliament to </p><p>make its ideological points. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Saad Hayel Srour is from the village of Um al-Jumal </p><p>in the northern tribal areas near the Syrian border.  He was </p><p>born in 1947 in Mafraq and received a degree in civil </p><p>engineering from Riyadh University, Saudi Arabia in 1970.  He </p><p>worked in the Amman municipality for four years, then worked </p><p>with private firms in Saudi Arabia until 1981.  He was named </p><p>a member of the National Consultative Council from 1982-84, </p><p>and was elected to the Lower House of Parliament in 1989, </p><p>1993, and 1997.  He was named Minister of Water and </p><p>Irrigation in the cabinet of PM Badran in 1990, was Minister </p><p>of Public Works and Housing under PM Tahir al-Masri in 1991, </p><p>and also in PM Zaid Bin Shaker\'s 1991 cabinet.  He was the </p><p>Speaker of the Lower House from 1993-97, and named to the </p><p>Senate after the King\'s dissolution of Parliament in 2001. </p><p>He resigned his Senate seat in May 2003 to run for the Lower </p><p>House.  He is the son of Sheikh Hayel, leader of the Srour </p><p>tribe, which has long supported the Hashemite monarchy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Srour speaks reasonably good English, although he </p><p>sometimes moves between Arabic and English in a conversation. </p><p> He wears a western-style suit and tie when in Amman, but </p><p>dons traditional tribal robes when in his constituency.  In a </p><p>conversation with PolCouns last week, Srour walked through </p><p>some of his ideas for reorganizing the business of the </p><p>Parliament.  He lamented the fact that past members of </p><p>parliament (MPs) acted as individuals and formed alliances </p><p>only for specific issues.  This, he argued, made it </p><p>impossible to organize both the priorities of house business </p><p>and speaking time on the floor.  He hopes that the presence </p><p>of a well-defined Islamist bloc will encourage the formation </p><p>of other blocs in opposition to it.  He is mildly encouraged </p><p>that the new crop of MPs is somewhat younger and </p><p>better-educated that past Parliaments (ref), and hopes to see </p><p>the development of a "progressive" bloc that will support the </p><p>King and government\'s reform agenda.  He also hopes to give </p><p>greater power to Parliamentary committees which, in past </p><p>Parliaments, have not held public hearings or kept permanent </p><p>records. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
