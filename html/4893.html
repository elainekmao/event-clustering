<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 009183 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT RE-ENACTS VETOED CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENTS; ALL EYES ON PRESIDENT SEZER </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 9073 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John W. Kunstadter; </p><p>reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Turkish Parliament Dec. 27 re-enacted without changes </p><p>a package of constitutional amendments designed to pave the </p><p>way for Justice and Development (AK) Party leader Erdogan to </p><p>regain his political rights, run for parliament, and thus </p><p>become Prime Minister (reftel).  The package -- approved by </p><p>parliament Dec. 13 but vetoed by President Sezer -- passed </p><p>strongly with 437 votes in the 550-seat parliament, including </p><p>fairly broad support from opposition Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP).  Forty-four deputies, mostly CHP, opposed; one </p><p>abstained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Sezer is obliged to sign the re-enacted package, but </p><p>has the authority to call for a national referendum or send </p><p>the package to the Constitutional Court for a judgment.  A </p><p>move in either direction would suspend application of the </p><p>amendments, thereby leaving Erdogan in limbo and thus </p><p>ineligible to run in a Feb. 9 by-election.  Opinion makers </p><p>are divided as to whether Sezer will call for a referendum, </p><p>but most think such a move would be risky for Sezer\'s image </p><p>since it is very likely the referendum would pass. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) That said, Sezer, who as a lifelong civil servant and </p><p>former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has exhibited no </p><p>patience for or understanding of the vagaries of party </p><p>politics, defended his earlier veto on the grounds that the </p><p>constitution cannot be amended "for the benefit of one </p><p>person". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) This is an exceedingly narrow judgment but one </p><p>consistent with Sezer\'s and fellow Establishment elements\' </p><p>considerable distaste for Erdogan and AK.  Many of our </p><p>contacts across the spectrum see these elements (e.g., among </p><p>ranking military officers, most of the bureaucracy, the </p><p>judiciary, the educational establishment, and segments of Big </p><p>Business) aiming to keep Erdogan and AK twisting in the wind </p><p>by preventing Erdogan\'s smooth return to the elected </p><p>political stage and by promoting friction between a sidelined </p><p>Erdogan and P.M. Gul.  Our contacts note that, beyond a </p><p>referendum, the State has other instruments -- including the </p><p>continuing closure case against AK and corruption trials </p><p>involving alleged misdeeds by Erdogan as Mayor of Istanbul -- </p><p>to keep him, his party and the AK government off balance. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
