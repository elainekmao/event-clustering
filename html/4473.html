<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, AF/W, DS/OP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PROTESTS IN ABUJA AFTER JUMA\'AT </p><p>PRAYERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: A demonstration that began at the Abuja </p><p>National Mosque after Juma\'at prayers today (about </p><p>1500 Abuja, 0900 EST) turned violent, with </p><p>participants in the 1,000-plus group of protesters </p><p>breaking windows, throwing stones and burning at least </p><p>one car. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Contacts who were prayers at the National Mosque </p><p>told us the demonstration was spawned by the agitation </p><p>of approximately forty members of the quasi official </p><p>Shari\'a enforcement group from Zamfara state. </p><p>Apparently, the red-and-black clad men stoked the </p><p>anger of others at the Mosque by complaining that </p><p>during the disturbances in Kaduna this week, fellow </p><p>Muslims had been mistreated.  There were no anti- </p><p>American statements nor statements against the Miss </p><p>World pageant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  When prayers ended, two main groups of protesters, </p><p>over 1000 in total left the mosque.  The larger group </p><p>headed toward Wuse Market. The other group moved in </p><p>the opposite direction toward NNPC and the Ministry of </p><p>Defense. Demonstrators began to throw stones at </p><p>passersby and then graduated to attacking cars.  The </p><p>small number of police in the immediate vicinity of </p><p>the Mosque were passive and did not attempt to </p><p>interfere with the protesters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. RSO was unable to drive to the airport at about </p><p>1520 when a group of men, presumably fleeing the </p><p>police or other security forces, descended from the </p><p>area around the Ministry of Defense (Shiphouse) to the </p><p>main highway below.  RSO reported two large plumes of </p><p>smoke from an unidentified area in the Central </p><p>District in the general vicinity of the Mosque.  RSO </p><p>returned safely to Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Embassy officer at a vantage point near the </p><p>National Mosque at 1545 reported seeing numerous small </p><p>fires in the area around the Mosque and the Sheraton </p><p>Hotel.  At least one police car was burned as a result </p><p>and it appeared that several others might have been </p><p>burned. Emboff also observed that a few small </p><p>buildings, possibly residences, might have been </p><p>damaged by the fires. The Emboff reported that the </p><p>bulk of the demonstrators had been headed to busy Wuse </p><p>market but was stopped by police and teargas.  Smaller </p><p>groups (para 4) might have broken from the main body </p><p>of demonstrators. Additionally, groups of protestors </p><p>from other mosques might have subsequently joined </p><p>demonstration but we cannot be sure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  We have heard one unconfirmed report of police </p><p>shooting near the Mosque.  However, the Emboff at the </p><p>vantage point near the Mosque did not hear shots nor </p><p>did any of our other local contacts. Additional police </p><p>deployments to the area were very slow and the </p><p>police\'s reaction was restrained, except for the use </p><p>of the teargas near Wuse market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Embassy FSN, on his way home to one of Abuja\'s </p><p>satellite towns (Karmo), returned to post when he </p><p>noticed youths leaving a local mosque attacking cars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. There were some injuries and at least one death in </p><p>the Wuse area reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  We have no reports of injuries to American </p><p>citizens or their property.  The parent of one child </p><p>at the Abuja American School reported that his/her car </p><p>had been stoned.  We have asked the school to keep any </p><p>children who have not departed.  We are contacting the </p><p>French School (where 3-4 Mission dependents attend) to </p><p>ask that they keep children until we are sure it is </p><p>safe to pick them up. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  By 1700 Abuja, 1100 EST, the main demonstration </p><p>appeared to have abated. Ambassador Jeter spoke to an </p><p>official from the Presidency at 1720 who said the </p><p>Federal Secretariat area was clear when he recently </p><p>passed. </p><p>However, there were still groups of stragglers capable </p><p>of causing trouble and we received an unconfirmed </p><p>report of a minor incidents in the Wuse district. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Kaduna remains under 24-hour curfew but traffic is </p><p>being allowed to pass through. There were reports of </p><p>scattered fighting last night. We have no reports </p><p>today of any incidents within Kaduna city but there </p><p>were a few attacks on cars at the toll plaza north of </p><p>the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Pageant contestants are currently at the Nicon </p><p>Hilton were there is enhanced security and are </p><p>scheduled to leave for Calabar tomorrow morning. The </p><p>Belgian and Canadian entrants have informed pageant </p><p>organizers that they want to return home.  The </p><p>American contestant currently is not planning on </p><p>leaving early. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
