Both Turkey </p><p>and U.S. are working to further improve ties, and Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul is welcome to visit Washington as are other </p><p>senior Turkish leaders, the statement said.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul also denied reports about a communication </p><p>problem between the two countries, and said he would pay a </p><p>visit to Washington at an appropriate time.  Some press </p><p>reports last week had claimed that U.S., saying time was not </p><p>ripe, turned down Ankara\'s request for a high level Turkish </p><p>visit to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Military `uneasy\' about EU adjustment move: National </p><p>Security Council (NSC) Secretary General, General Tuncer </p><p>Kilinc submitted a report to the Prime Ministry, in which he </p><p>outlined some points of concern for the military, "Hurriyet" </p><p>reports on Monday.  The military believes the amendments to </p><p>the Law on Struggle Against Terrorism might encourage </p><p>terror; allowing foreign observers during Turkish polls </p><p>would mean capitulation, and broadcast in mother tongues </p><p>might encourage separatism, Hurriyet says.  The opposition </p><p>party CHP is in support of the government\'s EU initiative, </p><p>and said such `restrictive attitude\' as displayed by the </p><p>Gen. Kilinc report should be abandoned, papers report.  AKP </p><p>deputy chairman, Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat said General Kilinc </p><p>had no authority to issue warnings for the government, and </p><p>added that the EU reform package would be submitted to the </p><p>parliament soon, papers report on Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AKP group `camps\' in Antalya: AKP leadership and deputies </p><p>came together in Turkey\'s coastal province of Antalya over </p><p>the weekend to consolidate group solidarity and discuss </p><p>problems in the party, weekend papers report.  Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan told his deputies that AKP has taken off </p><p>its trappings of fundamentalist views, and became a party of </p><p>the center right.  Erdogan pointed to the heavy burden </p><p>shouldered by AKP, and complained that the media ignored </p><p>certain democratic achievements by the government.  Erdogan </p><p>also warned his group against fundamentalist and racist </p><p>tendencies, papers note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF: "Hurriyet" reports on Monday that IMF First Deputy </p><p>Director Anne Krueger had doubts about Ankara\'s commitment </p><p>to the economic program, and warned against changes in </p><p>public procurement law and privatization.  IMF officials </p><p>believe the new review on May 21 will be `difficult and very </p><p>critical,\' all papers say.  Bureaucrats put the blame on </p><p>delayed government action, and are afraid that markets would </p><p>be upset by new troubles, reports comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Repentance Law: Tuesday\'s "Milliyet" gives details about the </p><p>`Repentance Law\' draft which brings gradual reduction of </p><p>penalties for terror organization members.  Defectors who </p><p>surrender and provide information about their affiliation </p><p>will be pardoned, according to the draft.  Defectors will be </p><p>given new ID cards, and job and financial assistance will be </p><p>provided for them and families.  Terrorists who are </p><p>sentenced to life, if found eligible, will be released after </p><p>serving a minimum of six years.  The new law excludes terror </p><p>organization leadership and commanders.  Meanwhile, weekend </p><p>papers report that the PKK/KADEK in Northern Iraq was ready </p><p>to disarm in the face of a general amnesty declared by </p><p>Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gul blames Turkish Cypriot administration for lack of </p><p>religious education: Saturday\'s papers claim Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul blamed the Turkish Cypriot administration for </p><p>the euphoria on the Turkish side to unite with Greek </p><p>Cypriots.  If the Turkish Cypriot government had accepted </p><p>Ankara\'s proposal in 1996 to open theology schools (Imam- </p><p>Hatip), Turks would not have sought unification today, Gul </p><p>allegedly implied at the AKP summit in Antalya.  `Look at </p><p>the Palestinian children, they are defending their country </p><p>with sticks and stones,\' Gul said according to papers.  In </p><p>1996, Gul was a member of Erbakan\'s Welfare Party (RP) in </p><p>coalition with Tansu Ciller\'s True Path Party (DYP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq in the post war era </p><p>"The road toward a chaos" </p><p>In mass appeal Milliyet (5/20), Hasan Cemal speculated on </p><p>Iraq, from which he had just returned: "After visiting Iraq, </p><p>the picture about its future remains blurry.  It is not very </p><p>clear if peace and democracy will be the winner in the post </p><p>war era.  There are a lot of question marks about the way of </p><p>Iraq\'s future is leading to, ranging from radical Islam and </p><p>chaos, to an ultra-nationalist movement, which might produce </p><p>new `Saddam\' figures.   . Observing the current atmosphere </p><p>in different Iraqi regions, it seems impossible to talk </p><p>about one single Iraq.  The Shiites areas bring a radical </p><p>Islamic wave, while the northern region demonstrates the </p><p>fact of a Kurdish entity turning into a state-alike </p><p>structure. . It is interesting to see nobody in Iraq calling </p><p>themselves Iraqis, rather preferring the ethnic or religious </p><p>identity, such as Shiite, Sunni, Kurdish, Assyrian and </p><p>others. . Evidently the Iraqi dictatorship failed to hold </p><p>all of these identities together.  Yet it remains to be seen </p><p>whether democracy will be able to shape unity.  In fact such </p><p>questions need to be addressed as quickly as possible before </p><p>Iraq turns into another turmoil." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is the US to do now?" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand commented in mass appeal-sensational Posta </p><p>(5/20): "The US wanted for a long time to make a model out </p><p>of Iraq.  Moving from that point it wants to affect and </p><p>reshape the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Central Asian </p><p>Republics.  It will be extremely misleading to believe that </p><p>the US fought the Iraq war only for oil.  Washington\'s aim </p><p>is to set up in stages a new system in this region.  Under </p><p>the new system terrorism will not be supported.  On the </p><p>contrary, efforts will be made to ensure stability.  In this </p><p>context, expectations from various countries will come to </p><p>the foreground.  The issue to be tackled in Stage One: </p><p>Resolve the Palestinian problem, and ensure Israel\'s safety. </p><p>. Also there are other issues in the package: such as Syria </p><p>scrapping the Baath regime, Iran\'s liberalization, Lebanon </p><p>being rid of its hotbed status for terrorism.  More </p><p>importantly, from the US point, Saudi Arabia is at the root </p><p>of Islamic terrorism.  The Saudi family is being asked to </p><p>definitely prevent the channeling of funds into the Islamic </p><p>organizations abroad, so that they will be able to protect </p><p>their own hold on power. . Washington also believes that the </p><p>establishment of democracy and stability in the Central </p><p>Asian Republics will result in ridding all countries, </p><p>Afghanistan included, of the terrorism threat.  It will also </p><p>cause some of them to stop supporting terrorism. . Naturally </p><p>there will be things expected from Turkey as well in the </p><p>process of change.  The way Washington views Turkey is </p><p>gradually changing.  The new way of looking at Turkey has </p><p>not yet taken a full shape." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
