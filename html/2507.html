(SBU) SUMMARY:  THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT IS </p><p>CONSIDERING DRAFT LEGISLATION TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  WHILE </p><p>ONLY IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES WITHIN THE PARLIAMENT, THE </p><p>PROPOSAL WOULD TURN THE BANK OF ITALY (ITALY\'S CENTRAL </p><p>BANK) INTO A RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND TRANSFER ITS </p><p>FUNCTIONS TO INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES.  THE ITALIAN </p><p>SECURITIES, INSURANCE AND PENSION FUND REGULATORS WOULD </p><p>BE ABOLISHED AND REPLACED BY INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES. </p><p>THIS COULD MEAN A DANGEROUS WEAKENING OF REGULATORY </p><p>OVERSIGHT, IF APPROVED, AND HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. </p><p>BANKS AND OTHER FIRMS.  WE WILL WATCH CAREFULLY AS THE </p><p>PROPOSAL DEVELOPS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY PROPOSAL </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JANUARY 24 BRUNO TABACCI, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES COMMISSION (AND MEMBER OF CCD- </p><p>CDU: DEMOCRATIC CHRISTIAN CENTER/UNITED CHRISTIAN </p><p>DEMOCRATS - PART OF THE GOVERNMENT COALITION) PRESENTED </p><p>DRAFT LEGISLATION TO REFORM ITALY\'S INDEPENDENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00860  01 OF 02  210650Z </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  IF APPROVED, THE LEGISLATION WOULD </p><p>CONSTITUTE A MAJOR REVOLUTION IN THE STRUCTURE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S ECONOMIC REGULATORY SYSTEM. ARTICLE 4 OF THE </p><p>BILL WOULD ABOLISH CONSOB (ITALY\'S SEC EQUIVALENT), </p><p>ISVAP (THE SUPERVISORY BODY FOR THE INSURANCE SECTOR), </p><p>COVIP (THE SUPERVISORY BODY FOR PENSION FUNDS) AND </p><p>CREATE A NEW AUTHORITY TO SUPERVISE FINANCIAL MARKETS. </p><p>THIS NEW AUTHORITY WOULD STRIP FROM THE BANK OF ITALY </p><p>(BOI - ITALY\'S CENTRAL BANK) ITS BANK SUPERVISION </p><p>POWERS.  THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITY WOULD TAKE OVER THE </p><p>BOI\'S CONTROL OF FINANCIAL SECTOR COMPETITION. THE BANK </p><p>OF ITALY WOULD EXIST ONLY AS A RESEARCH OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE SAME BILL PROPOSES THE TRANSFER OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY FUNCTIONS TO A NEW AUTHORITY </p><p>FOR INFORMATION AND THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY AUTHORITY </p><p>FUNCTIONS TO A NEW AUTHORITY FOR NETWORK SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) TABACCI\'S PROPOSAL TRIGGERED STRONG OPPOSITION </p><p>FROM THE PARTY OF DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI (NATIONAL </p><p>ALLIANCE (AN) - ALSO WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT COALITION). </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE PUBLIC WORKS COMMISSION, PIETRO </p><p>ARMANI (AN), TERMED THE PROPOSAL "UNACCEPTABLE". THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES ADOLFO URSO </p><p>(AN) OPPOSED ANY CHANGE IN BOI FUNCTIONS AND POWERS. </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT COSSIGA SAID THAT EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT </p><p>IS A CRUCIAL ISSUE AND IT WAS GOOD THAT TABACCI RAISED </p><p>IT.  COSSIGA NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT ONLY IN SIX OF THE 12 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00860  01 OF 02  210650Z </p><p>COUNTRIES OF EURO AREA (GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, </p><p>NETHERLANDS, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN) DO CENTRAL BANKS </p><p>EXERCISE FULL BANK SUPERVISION POWERS. COSSIGA </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE BOI (RATHER THAN NEW AUTHORITIES) </p><p>MIGHT TAKE ON OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY FOR BANKS, INSURANCE </p><p>COMPANIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) CENTER-LEFT LEADERS ENRICO LETTA (FORMER </p><p>MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE) AND GIULIANO AMATO (FORMER </p><p>PRIME MINISTER) PRESENTED A SIMILAR BILL IN JANUARY. </p><p>THEY COULD POSSIBLY, THEREFORE, BECOME SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>THE TABACCI PROPOSAL AND CONVINCE OTHER CENTER-LEFT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS TO SUPPORT IT AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MINISTER OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FRATTINI NOW </p><p>HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE LEGISLATION.  HE </p><p>COULD INSIST THAT THERE BE NO CHANGE IN THE POWERS OF </p><p>THE BANK OF ITALY.  BY THE END OF FEBRUARY, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF REFORMING THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES WILL PRESENT ITS FINAL REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND: THE BANK OF ITALY AND CONSOB </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

THE BOI MUST </p><p>AUTHORIZE BANKING ACTIVITY IN ITALY, MERGERS AND </p><p>ACQUISITIONS IN THE BANKING SECTOR, PURCHASES OF MORE </p><p>THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE CAPITAL ASSETS OF A BANK, AND </p><p>TRANSFORMATIONS OF BANKS INTO CORPORATIONS.  THE BOI </p><p>CAN INSPECT BANKS.  WHEN A BANK IS IN TROUBLE, THE BOI </p><p>MUST PROPOSE SOLUTIONS TO THE FINANCE MINISTER. </p><p>ULTIMATELY, THE BOI HAS THE AUTHORITY TO LIQUIDATE A </p><p>BANK OR FINANCIAL CORPORATION WHEN NECESSARY.  THE BOI </p><p>IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, BUT </p><p>LEAVES TO CONSOB (THE ITALIAN SEC) SUPERVISION OF THE </p><p>OPERATIONS OF THESE INTERMEDIARIES.  THE BOI IS ALSO </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING COMPETITION IN THE BANKING </p><p>SECTOR, IN COORDINATION WITH THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) CONSOB REGULATES AND CONTROLS SECURITIES </p><p>MARKETS, REGULATION OF SECURITIES INVESTMENT BUSINESS </p><p>AND BROKERAGE FIRMS, OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC OFFERING OF </p><p>SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.

IF THIS PROPOSAL BECOMES </p><p>LAW - AND IT IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME - </p><p>THERE COULD BE IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. BANKS AND OTHER </p><p>FIRMS OPERATING IN ITALY.
