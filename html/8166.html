Members of the DART Food Team attended the weekly food </p><p>and nutrition sectoral meeting on 5 May with members of WFP, </p><p>UNICEF, Save the Children, and IMC.  Topics addressed during </p><p>the meeting included a briefing on the progress made by WFP </p><p>in re-starting the PDS, a briefing on vulnerable group </p><p>feeding by Save the Children and IMC, and an update from the </p><p>DART.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>BRIEFING ON PROGRESS BY WFP </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) is working closely </p><p>with its national staff and the Ministry of Trade (MOT) to </p><p>assemble what remains of public distribution system (PDS) </p><p>records and data.  Although WFP has had success in this </p><p>endeavor throughout the country, Baghdad is proving to be </p><p>difficult due to the level of looting and damage to MOT </p><p>offices.  In addition, WFP staff have been assessing the </p><p>capacity and condition of the mills, silos, and trucking </p><p>fleets throughout Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.      WFP is working closely with MOT and local </p><p>authorities to verify what food stocks remain in storage, </p><p>including commodities and tonnages.  There is a countrywide </p><p>lack of pulses, rice, and milk in remaining stocks as </p><p>previous distributions were missing these commodities. </p><p>Rapid importation of these commodities will be crucial in </p><p>allowing WFP and MOT to round out the food basket until </p><p>regular distributions resume.  WFP is planning to first </p><p>finish the August distribution, which was interrupted by the </p><p>war.  (Note: The MOT had been providing double rations in </p><p>the months leading up to the war, which were intended to </p><p>sustain the population through July.  The March distribution </p><p>was interrupted by the war, leaving each governorate in </p><p>various states of completion.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP reports that local leaders in An Nasiriyah, who are </p><p>focusing on upcoming elections, pressured them to begin a </p><p>distribution, despite not having a complete food basket. WFP </p><p>advised these local leaders that the next distribution </p><p>should wait until they can provide the full food basket. </p><p>However, according to WFP, the local leaders went forward </p><p>with a distribution.  WFP is increasingly concerned that </p><p>distributions may be taking place for political reasons, </p><p>rather than from need. </p><p> </p><p>5.  In addition to the Basrah MOT, WFP has had meetings with </p><p>Coalition forces in Basrah, who have a good knowledge of the </p><p>situation on the ground and emphasized that security remains </p><p>an issue to be addressed.  Despite Coalition protection, WFP </p><p>is worried about bringing in new equipment to the site of </p><p>the MOT offices, which are still subject to looting.  It has </p><p>been suggested that MOT assets be guarded by armed MOT </p><p>staff.  But when questioned about this, a Basrah MOT </p><p>representative said he did not think it was a good idea to </p><p>give guns to guards at this particular time. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP acknowledged that a public information campaign </p><p>regarding the PDS is an issue that needs to be initiated. </p><p>WFP/Jordan informed the WFP/Iraq Program Manager that fliers </p><p>were being made to explain that the PDS will continue to be </p><p>the mechanism for food distribution and that a distribution </p><p>will happen as soon as WFP and MOT can provide a complete </p><p>food basket.  DART has been pressing WFP to undertake this. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In Basrah, the MOT representatives were less </p><p>enthusiastic about a public information campaign.  Their </p><p>explanation to WFP was that many people visit the </p><p>registration office everyday and are informed of what the </p><p>process will be, thus there is no need for a public </p><p>information campaign.  One MOT representative added that any </p><p>public information campaign would be considered odd by the </p><p>local population and would create suspicion among them. </p><p>WFP/Baghdad and Central MOT are discussing the best way to </p><p>proceed. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NGO UPDATE </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Save the Children, working in Basrah governorate, </p><p>recently identified 19 internally displaced families (119 </p><p>people) from Basrah living in a youth center near the </p><p>hospital in Az Zubayr.  These people left Basrah because </p><p>they lived too close to a military area that was bombed </p><p>during the war.  To get by, the children have been working </p><p>as laborers, and the families are in need of food.  Save the </p><p>Children will monitor that population and look into shelter, </p><p>food, and medical interventions. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Before the war, WFP stockpiled 1,200 metric tons of food </p><p>for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to provide </p><p>institutional feeding.  As a WFP implementing partner for </p><p>internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups in </p><p>the governorate, Save the Children consulted with the 14- </p><p>member Advisory Council of Az Zubayr, which reported that, </p><p>other than the hospital, there were no institutions in Az </p><p>Zubayr in need of food.  WFP suggested that Save the </p><p>Children link with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, </p><p>which has a list of orphanages in the Basrah governorate. </p><p> </p><p>10.  International Medical Corps (IMC) reported that the </p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) Program Director at a hospital in Al Kut </p><p>has enquired if WFP can provide food to the people from the </p><p>outlying areas who have to come into town to receive </p><p>treatment for TB.  WFP encouraged the hospital to submit a </p><p>proposal to support feeding this vulnerable group. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
