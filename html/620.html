<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 374527 </p><p> </p><p>INFORM CONSULS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  ETTC, UNSC, PREL, ETRD, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  UN SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS ON LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) USUN 5745 (NOTAL), B) USUN 5922 (NOTAL) </p><p></p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  AS POSTS ARE AWARE, </p><p>NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA CAME INTO FORCE AT 00:01 EST </p><p>ON 1 DECEMBER 1993.  THESE MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO BRING </p><p>TO JUSTICE THE PERPETRATORS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>PAN AM 103 AND UTA 772.  UNSC RESOLUTION 883 FREEZES </p><p>CERTAIN LIBYAN ASSETS ON A WORLD-WIDE BASIS AND BANS THE </p><p>PROVISION OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND </p><p>TRANSPORTING OIL.  IT TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR </p><p>EMBARGO AND OTHER MEASURES IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTION 748.  THE USG HAS MAINTAINED A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>FINANCIAL AND TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA SINCE 1986 AND </p><p>IS ALREADY IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTION 883. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>COMMERCE ON DECEMBER 3 TO BAN THE REEXPORT FROM FOREIGN </p><p>COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF U.S.-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY THE </p><p>RESOLUTION.  ALL EMBASSIES ARE REQUESTED TO URGE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE UNSC-MANDATED </p><p>SANCTIONS.  POSTS SHOULD ALSO REPORT ON HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>SANCTIONS IMPLEMENTATION AND ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO </p><p>POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE SANCTIONS.  TEXT OF UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTION 883 FOLLOWS IN PARA 6.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p></p><p>------------ </p><p>UN SANCTIONS </p><p>------------ </p><p></p><p>2.  (U) UNSC RESOLUTION 883 FREEZES ASSETS OWNED OR </p><p>CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA ON A WORLD-WIDE </p><p>BASIS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1.  THIS IS A ONE-TIME "SNAP </p><p>SHOT" FREEZE.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALES OF LIBYAN </p><p>PETROLEUM AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS EXPORTED FROM LIBYA </p><p>AFTER DECEMBER 1 ARE EXEMPT FROM THE FREEZE, PROVIDED THEY </p><p>ARE DEPOSITED IN SPECIAL ACCOUNTS AND SEGREGATED FROM </p><p>ASSETS SUBJECT TO THE FREEZE.  THE USG INTENDS TO WORK </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY TO IDENTIFY AND BLOCK NON-EXEMPT LIBYAN </p><p>ASSETS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE FOUND. </p><p></p><p>3.  (U) UNSC RESOLUTION 883 ALSO BANS THE PROVISION TO </p><p>LIBYA OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND TRANSPORTING </p><p>OIL.  IT TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR EMBARGO AND OTHER </p><p>MEASURES IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTION 883 IS THE RESULT OF CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE UNITED STATES, FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHOSE </p><p>CITIZENS WERE THE PRINCIPAL VICTIMS OF LIBYAN-SPONSORED </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST PAN AM 103 AND UTA 772, AND </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND OTHER FRIENDS AND ALLIES. </p><p></p><p>----------------------- </p><p>US UNILATERAL SANCTIONS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p></p><p>4.  (U) THE US IS ALREADY IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW </p><p>SANCTIONS CONTAINED IN UNSCR 883.  THE US HAS MAINTAINED A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AND TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA </p><p>SINCE JANUARY 1986.  ON DECEMBER 3 PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR THIS COMPREHENSIVE EMBARGO. </p><p>UNDER THE US EMBARGO, ALL LIBYAN ASSETS SUBJECT TO US </p><p>JURISDICTION -- NEARLY USD ONE BILLION -- ARE FROZEN.  ALL </p><p>TRADE WITH LIBYA ISANNED.  IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>INSTRUCTED THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE ON DECEMBER 3 TO </p><p>PROHIBIT REEXPORTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF </p><p>US-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY THE NEW RESOLUTION\' </p><p>INCLUDING PETROLEUM REFINING AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT. </p><p></p><p>------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>DEMARCHE ON ENFORCING SANCTIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>5.  (U) EMBASSIES SHOULD CALL UPON APPROPRIATELY SENIOR </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO UNDERSCORE OUR INTEREST IN </p><p>EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENCOURAGE STRICT ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OF THE UNSC SANCTIONS. </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TALKING POINTS: </p><p></p><p>-- WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS BY THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THE PERPETRATORS OF THE </p><p>LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTACKS ON PAN AM FLIGHT 103 </p><p>AND UTA FLIGHT 772. </p><p></p><p>-- IN UNSC RESOLUTIONS 731 AND 748\' THE UN HAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>DEMANDED THAT LIBYA COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS, ENSURE THE APPEARANCE IN COURT OF </p><p>THE PERPETRATORS, RENOUNCE SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, AND COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS OF LIBYAN TERRORISM. </p><p></p><p>-- ONCE AGAIN LIBYA HAS FAILED TO MEET A UN DEADLINE.  UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 883 SIGNALS THAT LIBYA CANNOT </p><p>CONTINUE TO DEFY JUSTICE AND FLOUT THE DEMANDS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH IMPUNITY. </p><p></p><p>-- THE SANCTIONS MEASURES CONTAINED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 883 </p><p>ARE DESIGNED TO PUNISH THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT, NOT THE </p><p>LIBYAN PEOPLE.  THESE MEASURES CAME INTO EFFECT DECEMBER </p><p>1.  THEY REQUIRE STATES TO FREEZE CERTAIN LIBYAN ASSETS </p><p>AND BAN THE PROVISION TO LIBYA OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR </p><p>REFINING AND TRANSPORTING OIL.  UNSC RESOLUTION 883 ALSO </p><p>TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR EMBARGO AND OTHER MEASURES </p><p>IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC RESOLUTION 748. </p><p></p><p>-- THESE MEASURES MAY BE SUSPENDED IF LIBYA ENSURES THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF THOSE CHARGED WITH THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 </p><p>FOR TRIAL BEFORE THE APPROPRIATE UK OR US COURT AND </p><p>SATISFIES FRENCH JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE </p><p>BOMBING OF UTA 772. </p><p></p><p>-- THE US HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE UN SANCTIONS MEASURES </p><p>FOR LIBYA.  US BILATERAL SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA IN FORCE </p><p>SINCE 1986 FREEZE ALL LIBYAN ASSETS SUBJECT TO US </p><p>JURISDICTION AND BAN ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND </p><p>TRADE.  IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT ORDERED ON DECEMBER 3 A </p><p>N ON THE REEXPORT FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF </p><p>US-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY UNSC RESOLUTION 883, </p><p></p><p>INCLUDING EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND TRANSPORTING OIL. </p><p></p><p>-- UNSC 883 EMBODIES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO CURB INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  WE CALL UPON </p><p>ALL OTHER COUNTRIES TO MEET THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ACTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>SANCTIONS MEASURES CONTAINED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 883. </p><p></p><p>-- THE LIBYA SANCTIONS COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE </p><p>GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC RESOLUTION 883.  THE </p><p>USG WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOLUTION. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEGUN AND ACTION SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR AN ANSWER FROM THE </p><p>SANCTIONS COMMITTEE OR THE USG. </p><p></p><p>-- UNSC RESOLUTION 883 REQUIRES MEMBER STATES TO REPORT TO </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL BY JANUARY 15 ON NATIONAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOLUTION.  WE BELIEVE THE DEGREE </p><p>OF EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF </p><p>MEMBERS\' DETERMINATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND RESPECT UN </p><p>OBLIGATIONS. </p><p></p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>TEXT OF UNSC RESOLUTION 883 </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p></p><p>6.
