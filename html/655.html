<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 02731 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N.A. </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, MARR, PINS, KJUS, VE </p><p>SUBJECT:  REACTIONS TO RELEASE OF FEB </p><p>          92 COUP LEADER HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) CARACAS 2512, B) CARACAS 2270 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  POLITICAL REACTION TO THE RELEASE OF </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE FEBRUARY 1992 MILITARY COUP, </p><p>LTC HUGO CHAVEZ, HAS RANGED FROM "GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY" TO </p><p>WARNINGS THAT IT SENDS SIGNALS TO THE ARMED FORCES THAT IT </p><p>CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY. FOR HIS PART, CHAVEZ HAS EMBRACED </p><p>THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT AND ACTIVELY TAKEN UP HIS NEW </p><p>POLITICAL ROLE IN A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS AND </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENTS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE LEADER OF </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 1992 MILITARY COUP (REF A), LTC HUGO CHAVEZ, </p><p>VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPERS WERE FULL OF REACTIONS FROM </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS AND PREMONITIONS ON WHAT THE RELEASE </p><p>WILL MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY.  ONE OF </p><p>THE FIRST TO STRONGLY CRITICIZE THE DECISION WAS ACCION </p><p>DEMOCRATICA (AD) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER EMILIO </p><p>RONDON.  ACCORDING TO RONDON, THE PARDON OF CHAVEZ AND </p><p>OTHER COUP PARTICIPANTS WILL SIGNAL THE MILITARY THAT IT </p><p>CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY.  HE SAID THAT RATHER THAN </p><p>ESTABLISHING HARMONY AMONG MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, </p><p>THE PARDONS WILL BE AN IRRITANT TO THOSE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES WHO DEFENDED THE GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY SINCE </p><p>MANY OF THOSE WHO TOOK UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ARE </p><p>NOW BEING HAILED AS NATIONAL HEROES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  RONDON\'S CONCERNS ABOUT DISQUIET IN THE MILITARY </p><p>OVER THE PARDONS WERE SEEMINGLY CONFIRMED BY PRESS </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH UNNAMED CIVILIAN AND MILITARY MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM.  THESE ANONYMOUS SOURCES SAW </p><p>THE RELEASE OF THE COUP PARTICIPANTS AS A SIGN OF A LACK </p><p>OF AUTHORITY AND WILLPOWER ON THE PART OF THE CALDERA </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  (COMMENT:  THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MILITARY COURT SYSTEM ARE LESS THAN HAPPY WITH THE PARDONS </p><p>OF THE 1992 COUP PLOTTERS IS HARDLY SURPRISING -- THEY </p><p>WOULD VIEW THE GRANTING OF PRE-TRIAL PARDONS AS THE </p><p>JUDICIAL EQUIVALENT OF SWEEPING THE ISSUE OF THE REBELLION </p><p>UNDER THE RUG AND THUS DAMAGING THE INTEGRITY OF THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S JUSTICE SYSTEM.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE NOT </p><p>AWARE OF ANY SERIOUS SIGNS OF MILITARY DISCONTENT WITH THE </p><p>POLITICAL DECISION TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE COUP </p><p>PLOTTERS VIA PARDONS AND THEIR DISMISSAL FROM THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN COPEI </p><p>PARTY, HILARION CARDOZO, SAID THE RELEASE OF THE COUP </p><p>PARTICIPANTS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE </p><p>INTEGRITY OF THE ARMED FORCES AS AN APOLITICAL AND </p><p>NON-DELIBERATIVE INSTITUTION.  HE SEES THE PARDONS AS A </p><p>POSITIVE STEP FOR THE COUNTRY, AND CALLED ON CHAVEZ AND </p><p>OTHER LEADERS OF THE COUP TO UTILIZE THE POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS, RATHER THAN ARMED INSURRECTION, TO EFFECT CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN KEEPING WITH THE POPULIST SENTIMENT IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF THE COUP PLOTTERS, THE ARCHBISHOP OF CARACAS JOSE ALI </p><p>LEBRUN SAID THE PARDONS ARE "GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY" AND WILL </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPIRIT OF PACIFICATION NEEDED IN </p><p>VENEZUELA.  HE AGREES WITH PRESIDENT CALDERA THAT THE </p><p>RELEASE WILL HELP PUT THE "HOUSE IN ORDER". </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN A RELATED ISSUE THAT WON\'T SEEM TO GO AWAY, </p><p>"MOVIMIENTO AL SOCIALISMO" (MAS) PARTY MEMBER LUIS MANUEL </p><p>ESCULPI HAS ONCE AGAIN CALLED FOR A CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO A TRIP MADE BY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>RADEMES MUNOZ LEON (REF B).  THE NEW CALL TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>STEMS FROM CHARGES MADE BY CHAVEZ THAT MUNOZ WAS ON A </p><p>MISSION TO THE US LAST SEPTEMBER TO SECURE THE NEUTRALITY </p><p>OF THE USG IN THE EVENT OF A HIGH LEVEL COUP IN </p><p>VENEZUELA.  (COMMENT: CONGRESSIONAL DISINTEREST IN THIS </p><p>ISSUE WILL ASSURE AN INVESTIGATION WILL NOT COME TO </p><p>FRUITION.  WE SEE THIS AS MAS, ONCE AGAIN, TRYING TO MAKE </p><p>POLITICAL GAIN FROM THE SITUATION.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  SINCE HIS RELEASE, CHAVEZ HAS BATHED IN THE </p><p>POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT AND, THROUGH A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS, </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCES, AND TRIPS, EMBRACED HIS NEW CIVILIAN, </p><p>POLITICAL ROLE.  IN AN APRIL 4 INTERVIEW, FOR EXAMPLE, HE </p><p>CONTINUED HIS ACCUSATION THAT THEN DEFENSE MINISTER MUNOZ </p><p>LEON WAS PLANNING A COUP IN LATE 1993, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>ADMITTED HE HAD NO PROOF.  REACTING TO FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\' RECENT STATEMENT THAT HE INTENDS TO </p><p>RE-ENTER POLITICS AND MAY ONCE AGAIN SEEK THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>(ONCE CLEARED BY THE SUPREME COURT), CHAVEZ WARNED THAT </p><p>SHOULD CAP RETURN TO POWER HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD </p><p>"FIGHT HIM FROM THE MOUNTAINS."  HE ALSO SUGGESTED, RATHER </p><p>STRANGELY, THAT MUNOZ AND CAP WERE SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN A </p><p>SCHEME TO SURRENDER VENEZUELAN SOVEREIGNTY IN THE GULF OF </p><p>VENEZUELA TO COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  COMMENT:  A SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED POLITICIAN, </p><p>CALDERA KNOWS THAT TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  CHAVEZ WAS </p><p>RELEASED ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE VENEZUELA SHUT DOWN FOR </p><p>EASTER WEEK.  THE PAPERS FROM SUNDAY TO WEDNESDAY AFTER </p><p>THE RELEASE WERE FILLED WITH STORIES ON CHAVEZ, HIS </p><p>POPULAR SUPPORT, AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PROCESSES.  THERE WERE NO NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY </p><p>AND FRIDAY, AND THE CITY WAS EMPTY FOR EASTER SATURDAY AND </p><p>SUNDAY.  BY THE TIME PEOPLE RETURNED TO TOWN ON MONDAY, </p><p>THE HEADLINES WERE BACK TO WHAT CONCERNS VENEZUELANS MOST; </p><p>THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.  THE BIG STORY IS THE REOPENING </p><p>OF BANCO LATINO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  CHAVEZ, OF COURSE, INTENDS TO KEEP HIMSELF IN THE </p><p>HEADLINES.  HE IS CLEARLY CHARISMATIC AND ARTICULATE, AND </p><p>DEFT AT USING HIS STATUS AS A HERO -- AT LEAST IN THE EYES </p><p>OF SOME -- TO BUILD A POLITICAL MOVEMENT.  HIS IDEOLOGY AS </p><p>EXPRESSED IN VARIOUS INTERVIEWS, INCLUDING HIS ANTI-US </p><p>BIAS AND HIS OPEN THREAT OF ANOTHER COUP ATTEMPT SHOULD </p><p>CAP BE RE-ELECTED (AN UNLIKELY EVENT), REVEAL AN </p><p>ESSENTIALLY PRIMITIVE AND FUNDAMENTALIST APPROACH.  HE HAS </p><p>BEEN PUBLICLY LABELLED AS A "CRETIN" BY AN INFLUENTIAL </p><p>JOURNALIST, A VIEW WHICH IS SHARED BY MOST OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL CLASS IN VENEZUELA.  IT IS AN OPEN QUESTION </p><p>WHETHER A CHAVEZ WITHOUT HIS RED BERET AND MARTYR STATUS </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO ATTRACT SIGNIFICANT POPULAR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DAVIDOW </p><p></p></div>
