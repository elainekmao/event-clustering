<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002246 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS CONVICTION IN LONG-STANDING </p><p>MANISA TORTURE CASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 7467 </p><p>     B. 02 ANKARA 6189 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: An appeals court upheld the torture </p><p>convictions of 10 police officers in the high-profile 1996 </p><p>Manisa case; the ruling is final.  The officers are expected </p><p>to serve jail terms ranging from two years to more than four </p><p>years.  Human rights observers and European diplomats </p><p>welcomed the ruling, but said it does not necessarily </p><p>indicate a broader trend toward eroding the climate of </p><p>impunity for police who commit torture.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Ruling Ends Long, High-Profile Trial </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Turkish Court of Appeals 8th Department April 4 </p><p>unanimously upheld the October 16 ruling by the Manisa Penal </p><p>Court convicting 10 police officers of torture and sentencing </p><p>them to prison terms ranging from five to 11 years (reftel </p><p>A).  The officers were sentenced to 10 months imprisonment </p><p>for each detainee they tortured.  According to the </p><p>Prosecution Law, under which convicts serve a portion of </p><p>their sentences, the officers\' actual time behind bars is </p><p>expected to range from two years to four years, four months. </p><p>The defense cannot appeal the ruling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The decision ended a seven-and-a-half-year trial </p><p>plagued by repeated reversals and procedural delays.  The </p><p>ruling came less than three months before the statute of </p><p>limitations in the case was set to expire, which would have </p><p>ended the case with no verdict.  An Embassy contact told us </p><p>that Interior Ministry officials had complicated efforts by </p><p>the court to contact the defendants in an attempt to delay </p><p>the case long enough to avoid a verdict (reftel B), a common </p><p>practice in police torture cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Observers Welcome Ruling, But Remain Skeptical </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Justice Minister Cicek publicly praised the ruling, </p><p>saying that police will now "think nine more times" before </p><p>committing torture.  Pelin Erda, one of the victims\' </p><p>attorneys, told us the ruling is important because police </p><p>charged with torture in Turkey rarely do jail time.  She </p><p>averred that the ruling will discourage police from torturing </p><p>detainees and encourage victims to press charges.  Still, she </p><p>noted that the court sentenced the defendants to the shortest </p><p>jail terms permitted for torture.  Husnu Ondul, president of </p><p>the Human Rights Association, said the significance of one, </p><p>high-profile conviction should not be overstated.  Noting </p><p>that defendants in other recent torture cases have been </p><p>acquitted or given light sentences, he argued that the GOT </p><p>needs to launch a broad anti-torture campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The case drew close international attention due to the </p><p>large number of defendants and the possibility that the </p><p>accused would go unpunished because of a lapse of time.  The </p><p>EU used the case as a test of the GOT\'s human rights reforms, </p><p>tracking the proceedings in its progress reports on Turkey\'s </p><p>EU candidacy.  German and Danish diplomats told us the Manisa </p><p>case was at the top of the agenda for the EU\'s Turkey </p><p>watchers.  They said a decision to overturn the conviction </p><p>would have been disastrous, as EU observers were expecting </p><p>the October ruling to be upheld.  Both diplomats agreed this </p><p>ruling alone will not dramatically improve Turkey\'s image in </p><p>EU capitals; Europeans will wait and see whether a trend </p><p>emerges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Turkish judicial system\'s general inability to put </p><p>law-breaking police behind bars has contributed greatly to </p><p>the climate of impunity for torture.  For that reason, this </p><p>ruling is significant.  But the skeptics have it right -- one </p><p>high-profile case does not necessarily indicate a sea change. </p><p> In the area of human rights reform, the GOT has a tendency </p><p>to highlight individual successes while delaying fundamental </p><p>change.  It is worth noting that the defendants in this case </p><p>remained on the streets during their trial, while defendants </p><p>charged with speech crimes and other lesser offenses are </p><p>routinely held until a verdict is reached. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
