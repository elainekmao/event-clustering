<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEP FOR AF/S, AF/PD, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW MEDIA LICENSING REQUIREMENTS - ANOTHER MEANS </p><p>OF CONTROL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  On June 15 the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) </p><p>published new media registration and licensing regulations. </p><p>The new regulations are mandated under the controversial </p><p>Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act </p><p>(AIPPA).  AIPPA became law on March 15, 2002 and has since </p><p>gained international notoriety for its use exclusively </p><p>against journalists working for the privately owned and </p><p>international media.  The GoZ has used AIPPA\'s prohibition </p><p>on "publishing falsehoods" to arrest 11 journalists on 21 </p><p>different charges in the last 6 weeks.  In our analysis, </p><p>the new media licensing requirements give GoZ policy makers </p><p>a new and more powerful weapon in their campaign to control </p><p>all media operating in Zimbabwe.  This cable offers an </p><p>overview of the main features of the new regulations and </p><p>how they will increase GoZ ability to control the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Implementation Not Clear </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>2.  When and how the media must comply with the new </p><p>licensing and accreditation requirements is unclear and </p><p>makes media vulnerable to sudden closure.  AIPPA provided </p><p>for the establishment of a Media Commission to oversee all </p><p>licensing and accreditation issues.  Last week Media </p><p>Commission Chairman Tafataona Mahoso said that media </p><p>organizations and journalists working before June 16 could </p><p>continue to work under existing company registration and </p><p>accreditation.  However, the extraordinary Government </p><p>gazette published on June 15 (in which the fee structures </p><p>were announced) is vague on when journalists and media </p><p>organizations must apply.  It says only that the Commission </p><p>must act on applications within 60 days of receipt and that </p><p>media in existence before June 16 may continue to work </p><p>until their applications have been acted upon.  This leaves </p><p>open the possibility that the GoZ could order police to </p><p>close any media organization and arrest any journalist who </p><p>has failed to file an application for license or </p><p>accreditation by COB on June 17.  Given that the Commission </p><p>has not yet worked out all the bureaucratic details, sudden </p><p>closure of media organizations may be unlikely, but the </p><p>privately owned and international media believe they are </p><p>vulnerable to GoZ whim. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Demands for Sensitive Corporate Information </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  The application procedure demands that media license </p><p>applications be submitted with detailed and sensitive </p><p>corporate information.  The required information includes </p><p>market analyses, information about the organization\'s </p><p>financial backers, business plans, projected 3-year </p><p>earnings or losses, and the professional history of the </p><p>organization\'s leaders.  Clearly, this is not information a </p><p>business would chose to give its competitors.  Nonetheless, </p><p>this requirement forces the privately owned media to </p><p>provide this sensitive proprietary information to the </p><p>government, which is, in essence, the competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>High Application and Registration Fees </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>4. The sums being asked for application and registration </p><p>fees are very high.  Local media organizations have to come </p><p>up with Z$20,000 to apply for a license and Z$500,000 if </p><p>they get one.  This is not a problem for state-owned media </p><p>since they are able to rely on the government for funding, </p><p>but is a significant amount to Zimbabwe\'s privately owned </p><p>newspapers.  International media are hit even harder.  For </p><p>example, to maintain their bureaus in Harare, Associated </p><p>Press and Reuters will each have to pay a US$2,000 </p><p>application fee and US$10,000 for a license, if one is </p><p>granted.  AP and Reuters are not sanguine that they will be </p><p>issued licenses and are not sure that, even if they do get </p><p>licenses, they are willing to pay the US$10,000 license </p><p>fee.  We believe the GoZ would be delighted if the wire </p><p>services chose to move their operations rather than </p><p>acquiesce to a questionable law and pay these high fees. </p><p>Individual reporters will also be affected.  The next time </p><p>a reporter from the New York Times or Washington Post wants </p><p>to visit Zimbabwe, they will be asked for a US$100 </p><p>application fee and US$500 for the accreditation, if it is </p><p>granted.  These exorbitant accreditation fees are certain </p><p>to diminish the number of journalists considering a </p><p>reporting trip to Zimbabwe.  This result fits neatly in the </p><p>GoZ\'s recent record of refusing media visas to </p><p>international reporters. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Selective Application of the Law </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>5. AIPPA was signed into law in mid March.  Since then, 11 </p><p>journalists (10 Zimbabweans and 1 American) have been </p><p>charged with 21 violations of the law.  All of the </p><p>journalists charged have been from either the privately </p><p>owned or international media.  Since AIPPA became law, </p><p>government owned newspapers have published many false </p><p>stories but not a single state-controlled journalist has </p><p>been arrested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Freedom of the Media Viewed as a Danger </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>6.   The chairman of the Media Commission believes that an </p><p>    unfettered press is a bad idea.  Chairman Mahoso revealed </p><p>    some of the philosophical underpinnings of AIPPA and the </p><p>    aims of the Media Commission in an opinion piece he wrote </p><p>    for the June 16 government-owned "Sunday Mail."  The </p><p>    article was entitled "Neo-Colonial Media Seeks to Undermine </p><p>    African Morale."  In this piece, Chairman Mahoso argues </p><p>    that if the pen is indeed mightier than the sword, then the </p><p>    media must be more tightly controlled than weapons.  He </p><p>    writes:  "...African nations are waking up to the fresh </p><p>    need to own, manage and make accountable at least those </p><p>    mass media based within their own borders.  These media, </p><p>    for the most part, have been employing foreign-borrowed </p><p>    frames of free-flow of information, transparency and press </p><p>    freedom in order to censor African history and to undermine </p><p>    African morale."  In this and earlier articles, Chairman </p><p>    Mahoso makes clear that he believes the media must be </p><p>    tightly regulated.  Chairman Mahoso\'s boss, Information </p><p>    Minister Jonathan Moyo, offered these thoughts at a June </p><p>    15/16 media training workshop in Zimbabwe: "The greatest </p><p>    challenge to any media organization is globalization.  It </p><p>    comes with several notions, such as the need for </p><p>    transparency and good governance, among others.  Media </p><p>    organizations should question some of the notions and </p><p>    verify whether they are par to (sic) the country\'s point of </p><p>    view or priorities for the country" (government-owned </p><p>    "Herald" June 18, 2002). </p><p> </p><p>    -------------- </p><p>    A Ray of Hope? </p><p>    -------------- </p><p>    7.  The Foreign Correspondents Association in Zimbabwe </p><p>    has filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of </p><p>    AIPPA.  Although a High Court Judge ruled in May that </p><p>    the suit was not urgent (because, according to the </p><p>    judge, "the law does not immediately threaten </p><p>    journalists\' ability to practice their profession"), </p><p>    the case will eventually be heard.  While no one is </p><p>    overly optimistic that the case will receive a fair </p><p>    hearing, the suit does offer a small ray of hope that </p><p>    the law could be declared a violation of the </p><p>    constitutional right to freedom of expression.  The </p><p>    newly formed Zimbabwe National Editors Forum also </p><p>    intends to challenge AIPPA in the courts.  These two </p><p>    legal challenges may, at the very least, delay the </p><p>    GoZ\'s ability to exercise complete control over all of </p><p>    Zimbabwe\'s media. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
