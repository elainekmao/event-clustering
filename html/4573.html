<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 005802 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR DRL/MA, IO/SHA, NEA/ENA AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2005 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, LY, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: CHR-59 LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP: ITALIANS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT PRECEDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 244156 B) GENEVA 4483 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: LABOR COUNSELOR JOHN BASS, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05802  021646Z </p><p> </p><p>1. ITALY UNDERSTANDS U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT CHR-59\'S </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS UNDER A LIBYAN CHAIR, BUT IS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>CONTESTING A REGIONAL GROUP\'S CONSENSUS CHOICE FOR THE CHAIR </p><p>WILL SET A BAD PRECEDENT FOR THE COMMISSION\'S FUTURE </p><p>OPERATION, MFA HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE DIRECTOR CALVETTA TOLD US </p><p>DECEMBER 2.  CALVETTA ARGUED THAT IT WAS "DANGEROUS" TO </p><p>REVISIT THE CHAIRMANSHIP PROCEDURES IN MIDSTREAM; THE </p><p>POTENTIAL BACKLASH AGAINST THE WESTERN GROUP\'S CANDIDATE NEXT </p><p>YEAR COULD UNDERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHR-60 IN 2004.  HE </p><p>WONDERED WHETHER THE U.S. AND OTHERS OPPOSED TO LIBYA\'S </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP COULD PURSUE A "DECLARATION" AT THE JANUARY </p><p>COMMISSION MEETING EXPRESSING THEIR DISPLEASURE WITHOUT </p><p>FORCING A VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>2. EU EXPERTS WOULD EXPLORE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES AT THEIR </p><p>DECEMBER 4 SESSION.  CALVETTA REMINDED US OF ITALY\'S EFFORTS </p><p>ENCOURAGING LIBYA TO REJOIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>POINTING TO PM BERLUSCONI\'S "SUCCESSFUL" OCTOBER 28 VISIT TO </p><p>TRIPOLI AS ANOTHER USEFUL WAYPOINT.  NONETHELESS, ITALY WOULD </p><p>NOT OPPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE UNDER WHICH THE AFRICAN GROUP WOULD </p><p>RETAIN THE CHAIRMANSHIP FOR CHR-59. </p><p> </p><p>3. LOOKING AHEAD, CALVETTA SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THE BEST </p><p>LONG-TERM SOLUTION WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR </p><p>CHR CHAIRMANSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY STATE FOR WHICH A UN </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR HAD BEEN APPOINTED WOULD BE INELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>CONSIDERATION BY ITS REGIONAL GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>4. MFA LIBYA DESK OFFICER SEPARATELY AGREED THAT ITALY WANTED </p><p>A WELL-RUN COMMISSION, BUT SUGGESTED THE CHAIRMANSHIP MIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05802  021646Z </p><p>BE AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE TO TEST LIBYA\'S COMMITMENT TO FULL </p><p>REINTEGRATION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: GIVEN ITS EMPHASIS ON ENGAGING LIBYA, ITS </p><p>LONG-STANDING COMMERCIAL TIES AND PM BERLUSCONI\'S RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO TRIPOLI, ITALY WILL NOT LEAD EU EFFORTS TO BLOCK </p><p>LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP -- BUT THEY WILL JOIN CONSENSUS.  AFTER </p><p>STEPPING ASIDE TO CLEAR ROOM FOR U.S. MEMBERSHIP IN CHR-59, </p><p>THE MFA HAS SET ITS SIGHTS ON THE 2004 SESSION; IT CLEARLY IS </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT INTRA-GROUP FIREWORKS THAT COULD SINGE </p><p>WESTERN GROUP CANDIDATES NEXT YEAR. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05802 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
