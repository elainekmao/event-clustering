(C) On his first day back at work following a trip to the </p><p>U.S. and the UK, Harare Executive Mayor Elias Mudzuri was </p><p>arrested by police at his office on July 7.  Police  held </p><p>Mudzuri for about half an hour, then released him without </p><p>charge.  Police warned him that if he returned to his office, </p><p>he would spend the night in a police cell.  On July 8 the </p><p>Mayor again went to his office with his lawyer, and was met </p><p>by riot police who took him to the notorious Law and Order </p><p>section of Harare Central Police Station for questioning. </p><p>According to his lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, the Mayor went to </p><p>his office on both days to confront arrest, in order to </p><p>publicize the lack of rule of law in Zimbabwe to the Africa </p><p>Unity (AU) Summit currently ongoing in neighboring Maputo, </p><p>and to President Bush currently on a five-nation Africa </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) This is the latest salvo in an ongoing attack on the </p><p>Mayor by the Minister of Local Government, Ignatious Chombo. </p><p>Chombo attempted to suspend Mudzuri in April 2003 for </p><p>allegedly failing to properly hire and fire city employees, </p><p>alleged mismanagement of city funds, and alleged failure to </p><p>provide Harare residents with basic services.  Mudzuri\'s </p><p>lawyer argued in an urgent court application on May 29 that </p><p>the suspension was contrary to Zimbabwe\'s Urban Councils Act, </p><p>and that, in fact, the GOZ was obstructing the Mayor in his </p><p>efforts to provide basic services to the city\'s residents. </p><p>Mudzuri has stated publicly that Minister Chombo\'s real </p><p>objection is to his exposure of ZANU-PF corruption in jobs </p><p>and contracts.  The high court judge who heard the case has </p><p>inexplicably not yet issued a judgment.  The Combined Harare </p><p>Residents Association (CHRA) has rejected the mayor\'s </p><p>suspension. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Mayor visited the U.S. recently on a trip partly </p><p>sponsored by the Embassy\'s Voluntary Visitor program, and </p><p>partly sponsored by other organizations (Ref).  His trip </p><p>included a conference of mayors in Denver, CO, the Corporate </p><p>Council on Africa annual meeting in Washington, DC, and a </p><p>Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government </p><p>leadership training course for public officials. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mayor Mudzuri suffers from high blood pressure, and </p><p>his trip was in part timed to reduce the stress he </p><p>experienced daily from harassment by police and other </p><p>government officials.  Emboffs spoke to the Mayor on July 7, </p><p>and the Ambassador spoke to him on July 8; all observed that </p><p>he had returned from his trip refreshed and combative. </p><p>Notwithstanding his medical condition, as one of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>most prominent public officials, he is confident and enjoys a </p><p>good fight.  He will likely continue to use his controversial </p><p>suspension as a platform for public protest.  This could be </p><p>one of the rare times an elected MDC official has turned an </p><p>attack by the GOZ to his own p </p><p></p></div>
