STATE 69419 </p><p>     B. THE HAGUE 01451 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  This is CWC-64-03. </p><p> </p><p>(U)  GUIDANCE REQUESTS/RECOMMENDATIONS -- PARAS 4, 20, 25. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The First Chemical Weapons Convention Review </p><p>Conference, April 28 - May 9, consumed a great deal of </p><p>Technical Secretariat and national delegation energy, and the </p><p>last month has been frankly rather quiet.  While the </p><p>annotated EC-33 agenda (faxed to Washington) is long at this </p><p>point, many of the reports to be considered either have not </p><p>yet been issued (Report of the Organization for 2002, Report </p><p>of the Office of Internal Oversight), or have just come out </p><p>(Audited Financial Statements of the Organization, </p><p>EC-33/DG.5, C-8/DG.3 dated 10 June).  The pace of </p><p>consultations so far not been intensive, except for those </p><p>regarding the 2004 Program of Work and Budget, a document on </p><p>which EC-33 in fact will not have to make a call.  Review </p><p>Conference follow-up is not explicitly on the agenda.  This </p><p>may in part reflect a widespread view that the RevCon was </p><p>first and foremost an obstacle to be overcome without </p><p>excessive conflict, rather than a major reorientation or </p><p>rethinking of OPCW priorities.   The new EC Chairman, Czech </p><p>Ambassador Kubernat, has scheduled consultations for Monday, </p><p>16 June on preparations for EC-33.  Del will seek to slim </p><p>down the agenda, removing those items where documents have </p><p>not been circulated in time and/or necessary consultations </p><p>have not taken place.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Three: </p><p>Statement by the Director General </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Del expects the DG\'s statement to be along the lines </p><p>of his opening statement at the RevCon focusing on </p><p>priorities.  It is likely he will discuss the RevCon results </p><p>and follow-up, even though these matters are not explicitly </p><p>on the EC agenda. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Four: </p><p>Status of Implementation of the </p><p>Convention and Related Issues </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>----- National Implementation Measures ----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Council is requested to consider inter alia a </p><p>second addendum to the Director General\'s report on this </p><p>issue of 13 March.  The second addendum/update was </p><p>distributed on 12 June (EC-32/DG.17/Add.2, dated 5 June, </p><p>faxed to AC/CB).  Del believes that noting the new document </p><p>is appropriate, while reserving the right for further U.S. </p><p>comment after study.  The TS effort to develop information on </p><p>national implementation measures is positive, and it is </p><p>appropriate to complement the Legal Office for what it has </p><p>done so far, while questioning whether the TS -- given the </p><p>priority placed on the effort at the RevCon -- is currently </p><p>backing the effort with sufficient resources. </p><p> </p><p>----- Optimization of the verification activities ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  The Council is requested to "further consider" the DG </p><p>report on the optimization and efficiency of verification </p><p>activities (EC-32/DG.12, dated 6 March 2003), which in fact </p><p>received no consideration at EC-32.  It is also asked to </p><p>consider two more papers which are yet to be published. </p><p>Guidance along the lines in paras 7-9 reftel (EC-32 guidance </p><p>cable) should be sufficient. </p><p> </p><p>---- Status of implementation of Articles X and XI ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  Under this item, the EC is to consider a report </p><p>published for EC-32 on the status of implementation of </p><p>Articles X and XI,and a yet-to-be published corrigendum.  Del </p><p>does not expect the report to elicit serious discussion. </p><p>----- Article VI related obligations ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  If it gets printed in time, the Council will have an </p><p>opportunity to comment on an update of the TS project to </p><p>assist member states to meet their declaration-related </p><p>obligations under Article VI.  If it is published, Del </p><p>recommends that we strongly endorse the project, noting that </p><p>this type of effort was strongly endorsed by the Review </p><p>Conference.  If the document is not published -- Del </p><p>understands it awaits the DG\'s approval for publication -- </p><p>Del recommends that we stress the importance of having such </p><p>an update and regret that for two Council sessions -- it was </p><p>supposed to be published in time for EC-32 -- the TS has </p><p>delayed in providing this important data to the Council. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Five: </p><p>Report by the Director-General on </p><p>the Universality of the Convention </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  The report on universality has yet to be published. </p><p>Del will forward to Washington when available. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Six: </p><p>Draft Report of the Organization for 2002 </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  This report is not yet available.  Del will forward </p><p>to Washington when received. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Seven: </p><p>Deadlines for Destruction of Category 1 </p><p>Chemical Weapons Stockpiles </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The Council is requested to note a DG report on the </p><p>completion of destruction of one percent of the Russian </p><p>stockpile. Likewise, Russia will present an update on the </p><p>overall status of destruction of their CW stockpiles.  The </p><p>documents are not yet available to delegations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Eight: </p><p>Detailed Plans for the Destruction </p><p>of Chemical Weapons </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Delegation has passed on the U.S. responses to a </p><p>series of Russian Federation questions regarding the Umatilla </p><p>and Aberdeen Combined Plans, but has received no reaction </p><p>from Russian representatives.  No other substantive issues </p><p>have been raised regarding these documents. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Nine: </p><p>Combined Plans for the Destruction or </p><p>Conversion and Verification of Chemical </p><p>Weapons Production Facilities </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>------- Bosnia and Herzegovina Combined Plan ------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The TS has received, and delegation is working with </p><p>the local BH representative to obtain a copy, of the most </p><p>recent BH draft of its Combined Plan.  In a previous draft of </p><p>the document the TS discovered some (undisclosed) problem </p><p>with page three, which the BH delegation has now apparently </p><p>resolved.  Del will forward the document to Washington </p><p>immediately upon receipt. </p><p>------- Russian Combined Plans ------- </p><p>12. (U)  The second of two TS teams inspecting Russian </p><p>conversion sites is due back from the Russian Federation 12 </p><p>or 13 June.  The first team has returned and is compiling its </p><p>report.  Upon the second team\'s return, the TS will generate </p><p>its report to the EC on the status of Russia\'s conversion </p><p>efforts. Informal TS reports indicate that the VX production </p><p>facility at Novocheboksarsk is contaminated, has not been </p><p>completely converted and, in all likelihood, neither its </p><p>conversion nor that of the QL, chloroether, or munitions </p><p>filling facilities, all at Novocheboksarsk, will be completed </p><p>anytime soon. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Ten: </p><p>Facility Agreements </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-------- Belgian Facility Agreement -------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) In a meeting with the lead Belgian MOD </p><p>representative and Belgian Ambassador Nieuwenhuys, the MOD </p><p>representative had a copy of our questions. Along the margins </p><p>next to virtually every question he had written in French </p><p>"non."  It was apparent he had taken offense at the extent of </p><p>our questions and viewed them as meddling in Belgian MOD </p><p>business. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Ambassador Nieuwenhuys, however, appears to be </p><p>taking a more considered approach.  For instance, with regard </p><p>to our question about the application of Belgium\'s safety </p><p>standards and regulations, vice use of TS/OPCW regulations, </p><p>he asked the MOD rep if he really intended to assert that </p><p>Belgian safety statutes should be subordinated to OPCW </p><p>regulations.  The MOD person thought about the question and </p><p>responded that this was clearly not the intent.  The </p><p>Ambassador then suggested that they had probably better do </p><p>some more thinking about the U.S. questions and the issues we </p><p>raised. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Subsequently, Ambassador Nieuwenhuys asked </p><p>Delegation if the U.S. would/could turn our questionss into </p><p>recommendations for textual changes (i.e. edit the FA for </p><p>them).  Delegation demurred, but agreed to sit down and go </p><p>over the document again with the MOD on 18 June, just before </p><p>the EC session. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Ambassador Nieuwenhuys has made it clear that </p><p>Belgium is not in a major hurry to complete this document. </p><p>He has actually said "this is not a matter of priority for </p><p>us." Delegation believes we should expect a more considered </p><p>and substantive response to our questions at the 18 June </p><p>meeting and proceed from there. </p><p> </p><p>------- Aberdeen and Umatilla Facility Agreements ------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) The Umatilla and the ABCDF Facility Agreements were </p><p>submitted to the EC prior to the last session.  Delegation is </p><p>unaware of any objections to these FAs, though the Russian </p><p>Federation indicated during the last session that it wanted </p><p>an opportunity to study them.  It is not certain that Russia </p><p>will make joining consensus on these documents contingent on </p><p>adoption of some or all of its Combined Plans for conversion, </p><p>but past experience suggests that will be the case. </p><p> </p><p>------- ROK Facility Agreement ------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U)  The Council is requested to consider an ROK </p><p>Schedule 1 Facility Agreement.  Delegation recently delivered </p><p>text of U.S. non-paper to ROK delegation, but has not yet </p><p>received a response. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Eleven: </p><p>Chemical Industry Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U)  Industry intersessionals are scheduled for 17-19 </p><p>June.  Del does not expect any decisions to emerge from these </p><p>consultations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Twelve: </p><p>List of Validated Data for Inclusion </p><p>in the OPCW Central Analytical Database </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (U)  Del requests guidance on the new list of validated </p><p>data. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Thirteen: </p><p>Report on the Office of Internal </p><p>Oversight for 2002 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U)  This report is not yet available. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Fourteen: </p><p>Report of the External Auditor on the </p><p>Financial Statements of the Organization </p><p>for 2002 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U)  This report is not yet available. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Fifteen: </p><p>Implementation of the Recommendations </p><p>of the External Auditor and of the </p><p>Office of Internal Oversight </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (U)  The document relating to recommendations of the </p><p>External Auditor has not yet been published.  Del expects </p><p>consultations to be held on both of these documents as well </p><p>as the previous two agenda items after the EC. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Sixteen: </p><p>Financial Issues </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (U)  The Director General has not had to use any of the </p><p>cash surplus from 2001, although only days back, before the </p><p>Japanese assessment of approximately 20 million euros was </p><p>deposited in the OPCW account, the organization had only </p><p>eight million euros cash in the bank including/including that </p><p>surplus (but excluding the Working Capital Fund).  Germany on </p><p>10 June signed its authorization for payment of the second </p><p>trance of its assessment (approximately 5 million euros). </p><p>This receipt of 20 million euros additional in contributions </p><p>means that the organization now has sufficient cash on hand </p><p>for about five months. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Seventeen: </p><p>Draft OPCW Programme and Budget for 2004 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (U)  Consultations on the 2004 budget are scheduled in </p><p>July.  Please advise if points arise from the Advisory Body </p><p>on Administrative and Financial Matters (ABAF) meeting that </p><p>should be raised at EC-33. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Eighteen: </p><p>Provisional Agenda for the Eighth Session </p><p>of the Conference of the States Parties </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  (U)  The provisional CSP agenda is not yet available. </p><p>Del will forward to Washington when received. </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Draft Annotated Agenda Item Nineteen: </p><p>Any Other Business </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U)  Del is not aware of anything under this agenda item. </p><p> </p><p>28.  (U)  Terzuolo sends. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
