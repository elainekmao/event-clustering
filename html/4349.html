<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR DO - SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: FATF UPDATE: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MOVES ON LEGISLATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2875 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Ambassador Jeter and RNLEO called on Deputy Speaker of the </p><p>House of Representatives Chidubom Nwuche (PDP-Rivers State) </p><p>November 15 to underscore the need for money laundering </p><p>legislation prior to a December 15 deadline imposed by the </p><p>Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at its October 9-11 </p><p>meeting in Paris. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ambassador emphasized the real threat of </p><p>"counter-measures" to be imposed after December 15 if the GON </p><p>fails to pass key money laundering legislation identified by </p><p>the FATF.  He described the adverse effect these sanctions </p><p>will have on the Nigerian financial sector, the economy, and </p><p>ultimately the Nigerian public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Nwuche responded positively, agreeing that the situation </p><p>is serious.  He reported to the Ambassador that the House is </p><p>ready to act on the draft Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) </p><p>Act sent to the National Assembly last month by the </p><p>Presidency.  Before it can act, however, the House must have </p><p>the bill gazetted by the National Assembly\'s print shop in </p><p>Lagos.  The FCC bill was sent to Lagos two days ago and </p><p>should be gazetted and ready for its first and second </p><p>readings by the middle of next week, the Deputy Speaker </p><p>claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Ambassador Jeter clarified that there are three pieces of </p><p>money laundering legislation awaiting the Assembly\'s urgent </p><p>passage -- the Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) Act and </p><p>amendments to the 1995 Money Laundering and 1991 Banking and </p><p>Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Acts.  Nwuche then noted </p><p>that the two amendments would be far easier to pass since </p><p>they modify existing law while the Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission Act would require extensive review to ensure it </p><p>does not conflict with existing laws.  The Deputy Speaker </p><p>asked if the passage of the two amendments would be </p><p>sufficient to forestall the FATF sanctions.  Jeter responded </p><p>that these are the most important legislative reforms as they </p><p>broaden the scope of money laundering beyond solely drug </p><p>trafficking proceeds and therefore should be enough to </p><p>satisfy the FATF, though passage of the FCC bill is still </p><p>desired and would demonstrate even further Nigeria\'s </p><p>commitment to combat money laundering and other financial </p><p>crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment:  Nwuche had called the press corps for the </p><p>meeting, which the Ambassador obliged by giving a statement </p><p>before asking that the press depart the Deputy Speaker\'s </p><p>office.  In that press statement, which will likely be given </p><p>extensive local coverage, the Ambassador underscored the need </p><p>for rapid GON movement on the money laundering legislation </p><p>prior to December 15 and outlined some of the possible </p><p>consequences if that legislation is not enacted.  Nwuche </p><p>appears sincere in his stated commitment to getting the </p><p>requisite legislation -- which we understand is the Money </p><p>Laundering Act amendment -- passed within the next 30 days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
