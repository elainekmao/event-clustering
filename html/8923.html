Gul discussed with his American </p><p>counterparts ways to boost bilateral relations, as well as </p><p>recent developments in Iraq and the Middle East.  In his </p><p>speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit, Gul said </p><p>that Turkey\'s democracy, respect for civil rights, and </p><p>transparency could inspire change in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU summit at Thessaloniki: The EU praised Ankara for </p><p>enacting the 6th EU reform package, and stressed at meetings </p><p>in Thessaloniki, Greece that accession negotiations with </p><p>Turkey would begin in late 2004.  Turkey has been invited to </p><p>an EU conference in October as an observer.  Turkish leaders </p><p>Erdogan and Gul had dinner with the German, French, Italian </p><p>and Greek leaders, which was seen as an indication of Greek </p><p>support for Turkey.  The final communique of the summit </p><p>urged Turkey to continue the reform process and to finalize </p><p>all legal changes before the end of 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Americans meet KADEK: A delegation of U.S. officials held a </p><p>meeting with KADEK officials on June 12 in the region </p><p>controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), </p><p>Saturday\'s "Cumhuriyet" reported under a front page headline </p><p>that read `Bush plays the KADEK card.\'  The American </p><p>delegation, headed by a colonel from Kirkuk, urged KADEK to </p><p>disarm, and promised them security guarantees. </p><p>Military service to be reduced: The TGS announced on Sunday </p><p>that compulsory military service would be reduced from 18 to </p><p>15 months, and tours for reserve officers will become 12 </p><p>instead of 16 months.  The decision will reduce the number </p><p>of soldiers in the Turkish military from 546,000 to </p><p>approximately 450,000.   Papers expect the move to please EU </p><p>countries, which had been urging Turkey to cut defense </p><p>spending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iran/US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"New illusions" </p><p>Ali Aslan observed in Islamist-intellectual Zaman (6/23): </p><p>"From the public affairs perspective, the characterization </p><p>of U/S Ziyal\'s visit to Washington for public opinion has </p><p>the potential to create new illusions in Turkish-American </p><p>relations.  Both Ziyal and Grossman spoke strongly about </p><p>`two strategic partners and allies.\'  Yet the real picture </p><p>was not as good.  It seems that the two countries used the </p><p>media to disseminate their arguments, and now have decided </p><p>to make things up by using the media. . The fact of the </p><p>matter is that Turkish-American relations are suffering from </p><p>the lack of depth, which is the true measure of a strategic </p><p>partnership.  There are efforts to upgrade bilateral </p><p>contacts, and Ziyal\'s visit is one of them.  The visit did </p><p>make a positive impact on Washington. . Another illusion is </p><p>about the future of Iran.  There is an overall picture </p><p>given in the media that Turkey has assured the US that `we </p><p>are with you on Iran.\'  Both the Bush administration and </p><p>certain lobbying groups managed to eliminate Ankara\'s </p><p>concerns about possible US plans for Syria and Iran. </p><p>However, this does not necessarily mean that Turkey is </p><p>committing itself to support the US no matter what. On the </p><p>other hand, Ankara and Washington have a common vision of </p><p>the future of Iran as a democratic country free of nuclear </p><p>weapons." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Making up with the US" </p><p>Zafer Atay wrote in the economic-political Dunya (6/23): </p><p>"Turkey\'s new message on Iran was fine-tuned according to </p><p>what Washington wants to hear.  Yet it requires a </p><p>clarification on Turkish policy to set the criteria for </p><p>supporting US policy and action in Iran.  . Iran, on the </p><p>other hand, is in real trouble.  The IAEA has issued some </p><p>very strong claims, including that Iran is secretly </p><p>producing nuclear weapons.  Apart from the international </p><p>troubles with the US and IAEA, Iran is also suffering from </p><p>domestic disturbances which seem to be leading to a strong </p><p>anti-regime effort.  . Turkish FM Gul has been invited to </p><p>the US in the midst of these developments.  His visit should </p><p>be very carefully prepared so that he does not find himself </p><p>in trouble in Washington." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
