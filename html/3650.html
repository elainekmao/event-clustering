<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SENATOR CORZINE DISCUSSES IRAQ AND THE MEPP WITH </p><p>JORDANIAN LEADERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 04607 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Senator Jon Corzine traveled to Jordan August 28-30. </p><p>On August 29, the Senator met with Foreign Minister Muasher, </p><p>Prime Minister Abul Ragheb, Minister of National Economy </p><p>Halaiqa, Minister of Finance Marto, private sector leaders, </p><p>the Trade and Planning Ministers, and a number of media </p><p>personalities.  The Senator also paid a courtesy call on </p><p>Crown Prince Hamza.  Throughout the meetings, Senator Corzine </p><p>heard familiar Jordanian views on Iraq and the MEPP.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>MEETING WITH FM SETS THE TONE FOR THE DAY: IRAQ AND MEPP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Senator Corzine, accompanied by his party, the Charge, </p><p>and Poloff, had his most substantive meeting with FM Muasher, </p><p>who underlined Jordanian concerns about U.S. military action </p><p>against Iraq.  The FM predicted the loss of $500 million in </p><p>Iraqi oil subsidies, and also expressed concern about </p><p>managing public opinion, which was already difficult because </p><p>of the "West Bank crisis."  As on previous occasions, </p><p>however, the FM--as did all GOJ officials the Senator </p><p>met--underscored that Jordan would safeguard its relationship </p><p>with the U.S. in any crisis.  Muasher said that Jordan was </p><p>encouraging Iraq to allow the inspectors back in, but was </p><p>"not having any luck."  Muasher also expressed concern about </p><p>"the day after."  He opined that the disintegration of the </p><p>Iraqi state would be a "disaster."  When questioned why, the </p><p>FM said he feared that in place of an Iraqi state, there </p><p>would be a Kurdish state in the North that would control the </p><p>oil fields, a Sunni state in the middle, and an </p><p>Iranian-controlled Shia state in the South.  Muasher </p><p>cautioned that a long-term U.S. military presence in Iraq </p><p>post-Saddam would also be problematic for the region as </p><p>people would see it as a foreign occupation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FM Muasher also outlined the GOJ\'s current approach to </p><p>the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation.  The GOJ has publicly </p><p>championed the U.S.\'s call for a two-state solution, as </p><p>outlined in President Bush\'s June 24 speech.  Muasher </p><p>encouraged the U.S. to exert more pressure on Israel on the </p><p>settlements issue, in part to counter the wide-spread </p><p>perception here that the U.S. is one-sided and is only </p><p>pushing for Palestinian action.  Muasher expressed concern </p><p>that Sharon was not committed to a two-state solution, "I\'m </p><p>not sure he\'s not unhappy with Arafat\'s inaction."  Muasher </p><p>underscored the significance of the Arab Initiative because </p><p>it addresses both Israeli security and demographic needs. </p><p>Muasher said that Arab countries need to take this plan </p><p>directly to the Israeli public to start "rebuilding trust." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Muasher also addressed the recent bulge in the </p><p>Southern wall in response to a question by Senator Corzine </p><p>(Reftel).  Jordan has sent a technical team to evaluate the </p><p>bulge and Muasher told the Senator that the Israelis have </p><p>overblown the problem because "they want a say in East </p><p>Jerusalem."  Muasher stressed that the GOJ wants to keep the </p><p>issue at the technical level and do not want to see it </p><p>politicized. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As the meeting closed, Muasher praised the bilateral </p><p>relationship between the U.S. and Jordan, emphasizing recent </p><p>trade expansion and calling the FTA a "jewel" that has so far </p><p>created 20,000-25,000 jobs in Jordan (comment: he was </p><p>probably thinking about QIZ-related jobs).  Muasher said the </p><p>beauty of the FTA is "that it poses no threat to the U.S. </p><p>economy, but it has done wonders for the Jordanian economy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PM CONCERNED ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Senator\'s following meeting with PM Abul Ragheb </p><p>(accompanied by FM Muasher) covered similar ground.  The PM </p><p>again emphasized the importance of the Arab initiative and </p><p>cautioned that action against Iraq would "complicate the U.S. </p><p>war against terrorism."  The PM also touched on another </p><p>possible consequence of a U.S. offensive against Iraq--an </p><p>increase in "fundamentalism" in the region.  The PM tied this </p><p>to the Palestinian cause as well, "if we solve the </p><p>Palestinian issue, we give extremists less material and </p><p>emotional buttons to work with."  The PM echoed concerns </p><p>expressed by the Foreign and Finance Ministers earlier in the </p><p>day about the economic consequences of a U.S. offensive </p><p>against Iraq.  Apart from Jordan\'s dependence on Iraqi oil, </p><p>Abul Ragheb pointed to the consequences on other sectors </p><p>(i.e. trucking industry, factories, laborers, etc.), "we can </p><p>deal with the unions, the protests, etc., but when people are </p><p>hungry, we have problems." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>OTHER MEETINGS STRESS GOJ ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) During their meetings with the Senator, both Minister </p><p>of Finance Marto and Minister of National Economy Halaiqa </p><p>enthusiastically pointed to indicators of Jordan\'s improved </p><p>economic performance and standing in the world, including </p><p>Jordan\'s accession to the WTO and the U.S.-Jordanian FTA. </p><p>Halaiqa pointed to continued economic reform, despite </p><p>regional problems.  "Jordan pays a heavy price for others\' </p><p>bad decisions, but it will not stop us from economic reform." </p><p> Halaiqa also voiced concerns about the impact of an </p><p>offensive against Iraq on Jordan\'s economy.  Halaiqa opined </p><p>that Jordan "will have to start from scratch" because any </p><p>cutoff in oil supplies from Iraq would force the GOJ to buy </p><p>from the world market, "draining" their foreign currency </p><p>reserves. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) At a luncheon hosted by the head of the Pharmaceutical </p><p>Manufacturers\' Association (who also owns a generic drug </p><p>manufacturer in New Jersey), the Senator heard from a </p><p>cross-section of private sector leaders and members of the </p><p>GOJ\'s "economic team" including Minister of Trade Salah al </p><p>Bashir and Minister of Planning Bassam Awadullah, about </p><p>Jordan\'s strong interest in doing more business with the U.S. </p><p>under the FTA and QIZ initiative.  They said that the main </p><p>obstacle deterring business was political uncertainty in the </p><p>region, particularly in the West Bank/Gaza and Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Discussion at a dinner with prominent media </p><p>personalities centered on the Palestinian issue.  Most of the </p><p>participants supported President Bush\'s June 24 speech, but </p><p>agreed that the focus on Arafat was counterproductive and </p><p>probably strengthened Arafat in the end. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Senator Corzine did not have the opportunity to clear </p><p>this message before departure. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
