<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 003288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, OTRA, ETRD, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: RESCHEDULING FOR MEPI TRADE ASSISTANCE CONTRACTORS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 209690 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 3256 </p><p>     C. ABU DHABI 3389 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Kuwait notes Ref C request that due to staff limitations, </p><p>Abu Dhabi asks MEPI-funded contractors Emad Tinawi and Lori </p><p>Brock to delay their proposed visit to the UAE until 9-12 </p><p>August.  That rescheduling would leave a 3-5 August hole in </p><p>the MEPI team\'s travel plans. </p><p> </p><p>2. Similarly, Kuwait has a staff shortage during the proposed </p><p>1-3 August visit here.  DCM, Econ Chief and SCO will be out </p><p>of country.  There is no Econ backup during Summer rotation. </p><p>FCS is understaffed and its chief FSN on annual leave. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In order to have an uninterrupted and productive travel </p><p>schedule that best fits to Posts\' staff limitations, the MEPI </p><p>team could benefit by starting its travel with Saudi Arabia, </p><p>as scheduled now, followed by UAE and then the others. </p><p> </p><p>4. Please advise. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
