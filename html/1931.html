<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002218 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W:BOOTH AND AF/RA:BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, KPKO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER ON OFR ISSUES AND UNAMSIL </p><p>ROTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 151930 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2117 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CDA, accompanied by DATT and PolMilOff, called on Army </p><p>Minister Batagarawa 4 September to discuss OFR issues and Ref </p><p>A points on UNAMSIL rotations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Batagarawa said he would meet with his Joint and Legal </p><p>Staff and promised to provide an answer on the Memorandum of </p><p>Intent this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa was unaware of the President\'s commitment </p><p>on January rotations made to the Ambassador (Ref B), but </p><p>promised to look into both requests and provide an answer to </p><p>the Embassy by September 10.  Batagarawa understands that, </p><p>should one Nigerian battalion rotate out in September (as </p><p>scheduled) and the other one in January (as we are </p><p>requesting), Nigeria would have three battalions in Sierra </p><p>Leone (all OFR-trained), but a reduction of one overall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: We were not surprised that the President\'s </p><p>decision had not filtered down to the Minister or the </p><p>Services.  Often, the Embassy is required to carry </p><p>information from one place to another within the GON to </p><p>ensure a coordinated response.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
