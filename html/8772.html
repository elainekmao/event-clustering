<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C.GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C.NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI, MDC, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE STILL PACKS A PUNCH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Peggy Blackford for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Robert Mugabe went on the offensive last week </p><p>following the previous week\'s mass action by the opposition </p><p>party, the MDC.  Mugabe was pugnacious and triumphalist and </p><p>used every opportunity to demean his political rival, MDC </p><p>President, Morgan Tsvangirai.  At the same time he took to </p><p>his political stronghold in the countryside and heaped </p><p>criticism on the West and local whites.   Tsvangirai is still </p><p>being imprisoned on new charges of treason.  At his bail </p><p>hearing, the State argued that thinking of treason is in </p><p>itself treason.  The judge reserved her decision until </p><p>possibly this week.  Mugabe\'s recent actions seem more reflex </p><p>than strategy.  There seems little to be gained by kicking </p><p>his opponents while they are down but in the past he has </p><p>shown himself to be incapable of conciliation. </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe: Getting younger and still punching </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>2.  (C)  On June 8 following a week of mass action organized </p><p>by the opposition MDC, President Robert Mugabe, in an </p><p>interview given to the South African Broadcasting Company, </p><p>declared that, "I am ready for a fight, I am getting </p><p>younger..., and I still can punch."  In the week since he has </p><p>matched his actions to his words, demeaning the opposition, </p><p>incarcerating political opponents on the flimsiest of </p><p>charges, threatening diplomatic establishments, and stirring </p><p>up racial hatred.  Avoiding urban areas which are MDC </p><p>strongholds, he went on the offense during a swing through </p><p>provinces and rural areas where ZANU-PF has traditionally </p><p>been strong. </p><p> </p><p>Taking aim at the opposition </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)   On June 13, at a rally some 50 kilometers from </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s second city, Bulawayo, Mugabe vowed to crush any </p><p>future mass action.  He warned that participation in </p><p>demonstrations would be "playing with fire" and added, "We </p><p>will never allow the MDC to hold another mass action.  That </p><p>will never happen again."  Mugabe derided MDC President </p><p>Tsvangirai saying sarcastically that the MDC planned to put </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Tsvangirai in State House (the President\'s home) by Friday </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and that he was glad that Tsvangirai was, in fact, in State </p><p>house (prison).  Referring to members of the MDC, Mugabe </p><p>said, "We hope they have learned their lesson.  If they </p><p>haven\'t, they will learn it the hard way."  The GOZ moved to </p><p>enforce this crackdown by announcing that it had banned </p><p>strikes in the public sector.  This would include doctors, </p><p>nurses, utility, transport, and communication workers, </p><p>firefighters and employees of the state radio and television. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And the British </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) A day earlier, at a rally in Manicaland some 300 </p><p>kilometers from the capital, Mugabe accused British High </p><p>Commissioner, Brian Donnelly and the British Government of </p><p>funding the MDC mass action and threatening to expel the High </p><p>Commissioner "if he continued interfering in the affairs of </p><p>the country by helping the MDC stage illegal and violent </p><p>demonstrations."  Donnelly denied Mugabe\'s allegations of </p><p>funding or organizing the mass action while underlining </p><p>support for "the rights of Zimbabweans to freedom of </p><p>expression and association."  This threat follows on remarks </p><p>made June 7 at the funeral of Joshua Nkomo\'s widow where </p><p>Mugabe criticized both the British and the American embassies </p><p>for their alleged "illegal activities." </p><p> </p><p>And white Zimbabweans </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Mugabe also used both rallies to fan hatred of white </p><p>Zimbabweans.  In Manicaland, he said, "These whites are not </p><p>deserving cases in regards to land allocation because they </p><p>are destabilizing our society.  They are supporting a party </p><p>pursing an illegal course to power.  If they have any land </p><p>left we will take it."  He then singled out Roy Bennet, a </p><p>white commercial farmer and MDC MP for the Chimanmani </p><p>district of Manicaland, for disrupting the operations of </p><p>newly resettled farmers.  Bennet, speaking to South African </p><p>news sources on June 15, reported that a separate farm in </p><p>Ruwa close to Harare had subsequently been occupied by </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters.  At the rally near Bulawayo, Mugabe said </p><p>that whites "just wanted to take and refused to give.  They </p><p>never accepted our rule ...They despise our government and </p><p>want to destroy it. We refuse to be destroyed.  Instead, we </p><p>will destroy them." </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai:  He sinned in thought </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  On the concluding day of Tsvangirai\'s bail </p><p>application, after defense attorney Bizos showed that </p><p>Tsvangirai had never called for violent demonstrations, the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>prosecutor argued that Tsvangirai was guilty of treason </p><p>because "It\'s not a question of personally or physically </p><p>participating in a violent or physical manner.  Merely </p><p>postulating or contemplating can be to commit treason."  This </p><p>led one MDC supporter to say that given that criteria "we all </p><p>commit treason when we wake up in the morning."  The </p><p>presiding judge said that she needed more time to render her </p><p>judgment and "could make a decision next week." </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe\'s actions;  Strategy or reflex </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment.  Most observers agree that Mugabe and the </p><p>GOZ came out ahead during the mass action proving that they </p><p>still have firm control of the military and police.  The MDC, </p><p>on the other hand, was limited to a relatively successful </p><p>stayaway, no small accomplishment but nothing they had not </p><p>accomplished before.  With that in mind, it is hard to </p><p>understand why Mugabe has chosen to be so deliberately </p><p>provocative.  A South Africa journalist speculated that it </p><p>might be early campaigning but that seems unlikely.  Instead </p><p>it seems as though Mugabe is incapable of new tactics. Mugabe </p><p>has the power to lock Tsvangirai away, humiliate him in leg </p><p>irons and so he has done it  Mugabe has always taken the hard </p><p>line and given nothing away.  That has worked for him in the </p><p>past and he appears unable to see that in Zimbabwe\'s current </p><p>economic situation, there must be concessions if the country </p><p>is to avoid ruin. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
