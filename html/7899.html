<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 001971 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, IT, ITPREL, ITPREL, ITPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS COMING TO A HEAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.

ROME 0355 </p><p>     D. 02 ROME 0348 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01971  01 OF 04  080841Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SENATE PRESIDENT PERA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR LAST MONTH </p><p>THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL </p><p>TROUBLES, AND FEARS THAT A MILAN COURT HE BELIEVES IS </p><p>POLITICALLY BIASED AGAINST THE PM MAY ISSUE ITS VERDICT IN A </p><p>JUDGE BRIBERY CASE TO COINCIDE WITH THE BEGINNING OF ITALY\'S </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY IN JULY.  BERLUSCONI, IN THE WAKE OF THE APRIL </p><p>29 CORRUPTION CONVICTION (IN A DIFFERENT CASE) OF HIS FORMER </p><p>LAWYER, HAS GONE ON THE ATTACK.  VIEWING HIS LEGAL IMBROGLIO </p><p>AS A POLITICAL STRUGGLE AGAINST LEFT-LEANING MAGISTRATES BENT </p><p>ON TOPPLING HIM FROM POWER, BERLUSCONI HAS CALLED ON HIS </p><p>GOVERNING COALITION ALLIES TO RALLY AROUND HIM.  THEY, IN </p><p>TURN, ARE HOPEFUL THAT A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND </p><p>THAT WOULD PROTECT THE PM AND AVERT A HEAD ON COLLISION </p><p>BETWEEN ITALY\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. </p><p> A DRAFT LAW THAT WOULD PROTECT HIGH OFFICIALS FROM </p><p>PROSECUTION WHILE IN OFFICE MAY SOON BE SUBMITTED IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, BUT THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION IS SO FAR REFUSING </p><p>TO SUPPORT IT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN THE EVENT BERLUSCONI IS CONVICTED, HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>THE RIGHT TO APPEAL AND WOULD REMAIN FREE UNLESS THE </p><p>CONVICTION WERE UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT.  VARIOUS </p><p>POLITICAL SCENARIOS ARE POSSIBLE.  IF THE VERDICT IS RENDERED </p><p>DURING ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY, THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME WOULD </p><p>BE BERLUSCONI\'S CALLING FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE AND </p><p>REMAINING IN OFFICE.  THE TEMPTATION TO MOVE TO NEW ELECTIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01971  01 OF 04  080841Z </p><p>AND CHALLENGE THE CENTER-LEFT IN THE VOTING BOOTH WOULD </p><p>INCREASE AFTER THE PRESIDENCY, ALTHOUGH ONLY PRESIDENT CIAMPI </p><p>HAS THE POWER TO CALL THEM.  CIAMPI, CONCERNED ABOUT ITALY\'S </p><p>INTERNAL STABILITY AND INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION, IS TRYING TO </p><p>PLAY A BALANCING ROLE BY URGING THAT JUDICIAL SENTENCES BE </p><p>RESPECTED AND THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED BE PROTECTED.  WE ARE </p><p>LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ITALY\'S POLITICAL STABILITY THAN WE ARE </p><p>ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF A CONVICTION FOR BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO CONDUCT A SUCCESSFUL EU PRESIDENCY--AND HELP US </p><p>ACHIEVE OUR GOALS--IF HE IS TARNISHED BY A GUILTY VERDICT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SENATE PRESIDENT WORRIED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SENATE PRESIDENT MARCELLO PERA ON APRIL 18 EXPLAINED </p><p>TO THE AMBASSADOR, WHO PERA HAD ASKED TO VISIT HIM IN HIS </p><p>OFFICE, THAT HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT PM BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL </p><p>TROUBLES (REF A).  IT WAS THE SECOND TIME THIS YEAR THAT PERA </p><p>HAD EXPRESSED SUCH CONCERNS TO AMBASSADOR SEMBLER (REF B). </p><p>PERA WAS CONVINCED (NOT EXPLAINING WHAT LEAD HIM TO THE </p><p>CONCLUSION) THAT A MILAN TRIBUNAL HAD ALREADY REACHED A </p><p>VERDICT IN THE SME TRIAL (NOTE:  THE PM IS ACCUSED OF BRIBING </p><p>A JUDGE TO INFLUENCE A 1986 RULING ON A CORPORATE TAKEOVER </p><p>BATTLE THAT INVOLVED A BID BY BERLUSCONI-OWNED FININVEST TO </p><p>PURCHASE THE THEN STATE-OWNED FOOD CONGLOMERATE, SME. END </p><p>NOTE).  PERA SPECULATED THAT MAGISTRATES IN MILAN WHO, HE </p><p>SAID, WERE WAGING A POLITICAL BATTLE AGAINST BERLUSCONI, WERE </p><p>WAITING FOR AN "OPPORTUNE" MOMENT TO MAKE THE VERDICT PUBLIC. </p><p> HE WAS WORRIED THEY WOULD DO SO CLOSE TO JULY 1, WHEN ITALY </p><p>WILL TAKE OVER THE ROTATING EU PRESIDENCY, FOR MAXIMUM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01971  01 OF 04  080841Z </p><p>POLITICAL EFFECT.  THE GOI, PERA SAID, WAS CONSIDERING ITS </p><p>OPTIONS TO COUNTER WHAT BERLUSCONI BELIEVES IS A POLITICAL </p><p>VENDETTA BEING EXERCISED THROUGH PROSECUTORIAL MEANS. </p><p>BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, HE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE PRESIDENT CIAMPI ON BOARD WITH </p><p>ANY LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>BERLUSCONI COMES OUT SWINGING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SINCE THE AMBASSADOR\'S DISCUSSION WITH PERA, </p><p>BERLUSCONI APPEARS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT THE BEST DEFENSE IS A </p><p>GOOD OFFENSE.  IN AN OPEN LETTER PUBLISHED BY A NEWSPAPER (IL </p><p>FOGLIO) SYMPATHETIC TO THE CENTER-RIGHT, BERLUSCONI COUCHED </p><p>HIS LEGAL PROBLEMS IN POLITICAL TERMS AND UPPED THE ANTE. </p><p>REFERENCING THE PROSECUTION AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION OF HIS </p><p>FRIEND AND POLITICAL MENTOR, FORMER PM BETTINO CRAXI, BY THE </p><p>SAME MILAN TRIBUNAL NOW ADJUDICATING THE SME CASE, BERLUSCONI </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT HE WOULD DEFEND HIMSELF.  CRAXI, WHO DIED IN </p><p>DISGRACE AND EXILE IN TUNISIA, WAS LEFT TO TWIST IN THE WIND </p><p>BY HIS ERSTWHILE POLITICAL ALLIES.  BERLUSCONI MADE CLEAR TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7474 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01971  02 OF 04  080842Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------61B135  080842Z /20 </p><p>P 071649Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9726 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 001971 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS COMING TO A HEAD </p><p> </p><p>HIS COALITION PARTNERS THAT THEY SHOULD THINK LONG AND HARD </p><p>ABOUT ALLOWING HIM TO SUFFER THE SAME FATE.  WHILE BERLUSCONI </p><p>IS CERTAINLY LOOKING TO ENSURE HIS OWN POLITICAL SURVIVAL, </p><p>THE PM\'S BEHAVIOR SHOULD ALSO BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF </p><p>HIS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO CRAXI; HIS BELIEF THAT THE POWER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01971  02 OF 04  080842Z </p><p>MAGISTRATES PURSUING WHAT HE SEES AS A POLITICAL AGENDA (HIS </p><p>REMOVAL FROM POWER) THROUGH JUDICIAL MEANS MUST BE BROKEN; </p><p>AND HIS RECOGNITION THAT THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION IS WEAK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) TACTICALLY, BERLUSCONI IS PURSUING A THREE-TRACK </p><p>APPROACH.  FIRST, HE USED A VOLUNTARY MAY 5 PUBLIC DEPOSITION </p><p>IN MILAN TO CONDUCT A POLITICAL DEFENSE, SPEAKING AS MUCH TO </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION AS TO THE ADJUDICATING MAGISTRATES. </p><p>BERLUSCONI REVEALED THAT CRAXI HAD ASKED HIS FININVEST </p><p>COMPANY TO INTERVENE TO HELP BLOCK THE PUBLIC SALE OF SME TO </p><p>RIVAL INDUSTRIALIST CARLO DE BENEDETTI, BUT ASSERTED THAT </p><p>BOTH HE AND CRAXI WERE ACTING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS THE </p><p>SALE WOULD HAVE DISADVANTAGED THE ITALIAN TREASURY. </p><p>BERLUSCONI ALSO SAID HE HAD PROOF THAT FORMER PM GIULIANO </p><p>AMATO KNEW ABOUT A KICKBACK DE BENEDETTI MADE TO THE NOW </p><p>DEFUNCT CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  HE ALSO IMPLICITLY </p><p>IMPUGNED EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT PRODI, WHO WAS </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE STATE-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY (IRI) INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE PLANNED SME SALE (NOTE: PRODI IS ALSO WIDELY TOUTED AS </p><p>THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE TO LEAD THE CENTER-LEFT IN THE NEXT </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTIONS. END NOTE.)  ALL OF THIS WAS TO CONVEY TO </p><p>THE PUBLIC THAT, "THERE WERE A LOT OF SHADY DEALINGS </p><p>SURROUNDING THE SME AFFAIR, BUT SEE HOW THE MAGISTRATES ARE </p><p>ONLY OUT TO GET ME, WHO WON YOUR VOTES IN A DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ELECTION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SECONDLY, BERLUSCONI IS EXAMINING HIS LEGISLATIVE </p><p>OPTIONS.  ONE POSSIBLE ROUTE IS PASSING A LAW, AS EXISTS IN </p><p>SOME OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THAT WOULD PROTECT HIGH </p><p>OFFICIALS (THE PM, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, AND PRESIDENTS </p><p>OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF DEPUTIES) FROM PROSECUTION WHILE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01971  02 OF 04  080842Z </p><p>THEY ARE SERVING THEIR TERMS.  A MODERATE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>POLITICIAN EARLIER THIS YEAR PROPOSED SUCH A MEASURE, WHICH </p><p>BERLUSCONI AS WELL AS PERA AND PIERFERDINANDO CASINI, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF DEPUTIES, HAVE NOW ENDORSED. </p><p>HOWEVER, PIERO FASSINO, LEADER OF ITALY\'S LARGEST LEFT-WING </p><p>PARTY (THE DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT), HAS REJECTED IT, ARGUING </p><p>THAT "POLITICAL CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR A MEASURE THAT </p><p>WOULD PROTECT CURRENT OFFICE-HOLDERS."  THE GOVERNING </p><p>MAJORITY COULD PASS SUCH A LAW ON ITS OWN, BUT WITHOUT SOME </p><p>CENTER-LEFT SUPPORT IT WOULD BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT IT WAS CRASSLY SELF-SERVING.  ANOTHER </p><p>ALTERNATIVE IS TO REINTRODUCE FULL PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY FOR </p><p>SITTING LEGISLATORS.  IMMUNITY WAS LIFTED IN PART IN 1993 TO </p><p>ALLOW MAGISTRATES TO PURSUE SWEEPING ANTI-CORRUPTION </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS.  FOR BERLUSCONI, REINSTITUTING PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>IMMUNITY WOULD BE SWEET REVENGE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. </p><p>HOWEVER, PASSAGE WOULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>AND, THEREFORE, A MINIMUM OF SIX MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) FINALLY, BERLUSCONI\'S LAWYERS HAVE THREATENED TO CALL </p><p>HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL WITNESSES--INCLUDING MINISTERS IN THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT AND FORMER HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS--IN </p><p>AN ATTEMPT TO DELAY A VERDICT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE DECISION WHETHER TO ALLOW THESE WITNESSES RESTS WITH THE </p><p>MILAN COURT. </p><p> </p><p>CONVICTION SCENARIOS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THE MILAN TRIBUNAL WILL RULE ON BERLUSCONI\'S CASE </p><p>AS A COURT OF "FIRST INSTANCE".  THE LOSING SIDE (EITHER PM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01971  02 OF 04  080842Z </p><p>OR PROSECUTOR) WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE VERDICT. </p><p>UNDER ITALIAN LAW, A PERSON APPEALING A CRIMINAL CONVICTION </p><p>IS PERMITTED TO REMAIN FREE UNTIL A FINAL RULING IS RENDERED </p><p>(UNLESS BEING HELD IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY, INAPPLICABLE TO THE </p><p>CASE IN QUESTION).  APPELLATE DECISIONS ARE OFTEN REVIEWED BY </p><p>THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURT, WHICH IS MORE INCLUSIVE IN WHAT IT </p><p>REVIEWS THAN IS ITS U.S. EQUIVALENT.  THUS, IF BERLUSCONI </p><p>WERE CONVICTED, AND THAT CONVICTION WERE UPHELD ON APPEAL, </p><p>THE CASE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCEPTED BY THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT FOR ADJUDICATION, LIKELY PUSHING A FINAL RULING ON THE </p><p>CASE SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.  BEARING THIS IN MIND, </p><p>SEVERAL POSSIBLE SCENARIOS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE EVENT </p><p>THAT BERLUSCONI IS CONVICTED THIS SUMMER AND THAT NO </p><p>LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE MEANTIME. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN DESCENDING ORDER OF LIKELIHOOD, BERLUSCONI COULD </p><p>REBUFF CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION BY ARGUING--AS HE DID IN THE </p><p>RECENTLY CONCLUDED PREVITI CASE (REF A)--THAT THE MILAN </p><p>MAGISTRATES HANDED DOWN A "POLITICAL VERDICT," AND THAT HE </p><p>HAS ULTIMATELY BEEN ACQUITTED ON ALL CHARGES IN EVERY TRIAL </p><p>AGAINST HIM THAT HAS RUN ITS FULL COURSE.  (NOTE: CHARGES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1272 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01971  03 OF 04  090048Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------623BC8  090049Z /34 </p><p>P 071649Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9727 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 001971 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS COMING TO A HEAD </p><p> </p><p>AGAINST BERLUSCONI HAVE BEEN DROPPED IN SEVERAL CASES BECAUSE </p><p>THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD EXPIRED.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  BERLUSCONI COULD USE ANY PENDING PARLIAMENTARY VOTE </p><p>AS A DEVICE TO CALL FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WHICH WE BELIEVE HE WOULD WIN.  IN ITALY, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01971  03 OF 04  090048Z </p><p>PAROCHIAL CONCERNS CAN OFTEN TURN VERY SERIOUS AND COULD </p><p>STILL CAUSE A GOVERNMENT CRISIS.  HOWEVER, NONE OF </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S KEY COALITION PARTNERS HAS AN INTEREST IN </p><p>BRINGING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE NORTHERN LEAGUE\'S </p><p>UMBERTO BOSSI, WHO HAS HAD HIS OWN TROUBLED HISTORY WITH </p><p>ITALIAN MAGISTRATES AND HAS COME TO BERLUSCONI\'S DEFENSE. </p><p>MOREOVER, POLLS CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE PUBLIC IS STILL </p><p>RATHER NUMB TO BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL IMBROGLIO.  NEARLY ALL </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT VOTERS SHARE BERLUSCONI\'S VIEW OF THE </p><p>POLITICIZED JUDICIARY; EVEN A CONVICTION WOULD NOT CAUSE THEM </p><p>TO CHANGE THEIR VOTES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) EARLY ELECTIONS ARE A POSSIBILITY AND BERLUSCONI IS </p><p>USING THEM AS A RHETORICAL STICK TO THREATEN THE CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>WHICH IS UNPREPARED TO GO TO THE POLLS.  ONLY PRESIDENT </p><p>CIAMPI IS EMPOWERED TO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT AND CALL </p><p>ELECTIONS, HOWEVER.  WE BELIEVE HE WOULD BE LOATH TO DO SO </p><p>BECAUSE IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE INSTITUTIONAL INSTABILITY AT A </p><p>CRUCIAL MOMENT IN ITALY\'S POLITICAL HISTORY AND THIS IS </p><p>SOMETHING CIAMPI HAS WORKED HARD TO PROTECT AGAINST. </p><p>BERLUSCONI COULD, HOWEVER, RESIGN, FORCING CIAMPI TO ACT. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO US THAT HE WOULD DO SO IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE OF THE EU PRESIDENCY.  A RESIGNATION, FOLLOWED BY NEW </p><p>ELECTIONS, WOULD BE MORE LIKELY IF A CONVICTION WERE HANDED </p><p>DOWN IN 2004. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) FINALLY, WHILE THE OPPOSITION COULD CALL ON CIAMPI </p><p>TO ORGANIZE A TECHNICAL GOVERNMENT TO USHER ITALY THROUGH ITS </p><p>PRESIDENCY, THIS WOULD REQUIRE BERLUSCONI\'S CONSENT AS LONG </p><p>AS HE ENJOYS A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY.  SUCH A SOLUTION WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01971  03 OF 04  090048Z </p><p>BE A REVERSION TO PAST PRACTICE AND A SEVERE DEFEAT FOR </p><p>ITALY\'S ONGOING POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION -- AGAIN, WE THINK </p><p>CIAMPI WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO PURSUE THIS ROUTE, NOT LEAST </p><p>BECAUSE HE PUBLICLY REITERATED THAT NO DEFENDANT IS GUILTY </p><p>UNTIL PROVEN SO IN A COURT OF LAST APPEAL. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) CIAMPI, FOR HIS PART, WILL CONTINUE HIS EFFORTS TO </p><p>CREATE A CLIMATE OF MODERATION.  HE, LIKE PERA AND CASINI, IS </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT ITALY\'S STANDING -- NOT ONLY IN THE EVENT OF </p><p>A CONVICTION BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE IMAGE CREATED BY THE </p><p>CONTINUING STANDOFF BETWEEN BERLUSCONI, THE OPPOSITION, AND </p><p>CERTAIN MAGISTRATES (REF C).  CIAMPI HAS THEREFORE SIGNALED </p><p>THAT HE COULD ACCEPT A SOLUTION THAT PROTECTED THE HIGHEST </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE FROM PROSECUTION DURING THEIR </p><p>TERMS IN OFFICE.  HE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES </p><p>TO FORGE CONSENSUS AROUND THIS OUTCOME, WHICH MAY BECOME MORE </p><p>PRACTICABLE FOLLOWING LOCAL ELECTIONS AT THE END OF MAY. </p><p>EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, WE WOULD NOT PREDICT BIPARTISAN HARMONY, </p><p>BUT AT MOST THE POTENTIAL ABSTENTION OF SOME OF THE MORE </p><p>CENTRIST MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  CONVICTION OF THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER WOULD HARM </p><p>NOT ONLY BERLUSCONI\'S IMAGE, BUT ITALY\'S AS WELL. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS HARD TO ARGUE WITH PERA\'S CONVICTION </p><p>THAT A POLITICIZED MAGISTRACY HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO RELEASE </p><p>A CONVICTION DECISION TIMED TO INFLICT MAXIMUM POLITICAL HARM </p><p>ON THE CENTER-RIGHT MAJORITY:  THE MILAN TRIBUNAL DID JUST </p><p>THAT IN 1994, DURING BERLUSCONI\'S FIRST TERM AS PM.  DESPITE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01971  03 OF 04  090048Z </p><p>NERVOUSNESS AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES, HOWEVER, BERLUSCONI HAS </p><p>DETERMINED TO STRIKE FIRST, AND HARD, IN AN ATTEMPT TO FRAME </p><p>THE ARGUMENTS FOR THE PUBLIC IN HIS FAVOR, BEFORE A DECISION </p><p>IN THE SME CASE IS RENDERED.  SILVIO BERLUSCONI WILL NOT GO </p><p>QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT, AND OF THIS HE HAS GIVEN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION FAIR NOTICE.  THE PM IS OBVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO </p><p>DEFEND HIMSELF, HIS POLITICAL LIFE, AND HIS HONOR, BUT WE </p><p>WONDER IF HE IS NOT ALSO ACTING IN PART TO VINDICATE, </p><p>POSTHUMOUSLY, BETTINO CRAXI. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  WE REMAIN RELATIVELY SANGUINE ABOUT THE STABILITY </p><p>OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT.
