(C) SUMMARY.  THE LONG ANTICIPATED VISIT OF THE SADC </p><p>MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE DEALING WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>SITUATION TOOK PLACE ON DECEMBER 10 AND 11, LONG ON </p><p>RHETORIC BUT SHORT ON RESULTS.  THE GOZ MANAGED TO </p><p>CONTROL BOTH THE AGENDA AND THE FOCUS OF THE MEETING, </p><p>WHICH YIELDED A LARGELY TOOTHLESS FINAL COMMUNIQUE. </p><p>READOUTS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE GOZ WAS </p><p>SPARED SERIOUS CRITICISM FROM THEIR SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>BRETHREN, WHO SHOWED LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR "THE OTHER </p><p>SIDE" OF THE EQUATION.  WHILE IT MAY BE TOO EARLY TO </p><p>WRITE OFF THE PROCESS ALTOGETHER, THE VISITING SADC </p><p>MINISTERS SHOWED LITTLE STOMACH FOR CONFRONTING ZIMBABWE </p><p>ABOUT ITS ESCALATING INTERNAL CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE MOZAMBICAN TAKE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>MOZAMBICAN HIGH COMMISSIONER SUMBANA DESCRIBED THE VISIT </p><p>AS "GOOD."  HE SAID THAT THE MINISTERS HAD AGREED, NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, THAT ZIMBABWE NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD ON </p><p>THE LAND REFORM ISSUE.  THEY ALSO AGREED THAT IT WAS </p><p>ESSENTIAL TO FIND EXTERNAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>REFORM PROCESS, PRESUMABLY FROM BRITAIN.  THEY ADMITTED </p><p>TO CONTINUING PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE BUT OBSERVED THAT </p><p>THE VIOLENCE WAS LESS SERIOUS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03691  01 OF 02  130533Z </p><p>3.  (C) SUMBANA SAID THAT THE GOZ ALSO AGREED TO DISCUSS </p><p>OTHER RELATED ISSUES, INCLUDING ELECTIONS.  THE GOZ </p><p>AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO THE SADC-PF ELECTORAL NORMS AND </p><p>STANDARDS WITH THE CAVEAT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT </p><p>TIME LEFT TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND SPECIFICALLY ESTABLISHMENT OF AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION.  HOWEVER, THEY WOULD </p><p>NOT YIELD ON THE ISSUE OF CIVIL SERVANTS SERVING AS </p><p>ELECTION MONITORS (VICE THE CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES USED IN THE PAST, ALTHUOGH WE UNDERSTAND </p><p>FROM OTHER SOURCES THERE MIGHT STILL BE MOVEMENT ON </p><p>THIS).  HE SAID THAT THERE WERE ASSURANCES THAT SADC-PF </p><p>WOULD BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE ELECTION, WITH OBSERVERS </p><p>PERMITTED TO BEGIN THEIR WORK AT A STILL UNSPECIFIED </p><p>DATE IN JANUARY. SUMBANA DOFFED HIS SADC HAT FOR A </p><p>MOMENT AND POPPED ON HIS HONEST BROKER\'S CAP.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE GOZ SEEMED RELUCTANT TO PICK A FIGHT </p><p>WITH THE U.S. AND ASKED WHAT MEASURES THE GOZ NEEDED TO </p><p>TAKE IN REVISING THE ELECTORAL LAW TO SUIT US. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE CFU TAKE </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>MALCOLM VOWLES DESCRIBED TO DCM THE SADC MINISTERS\' </p><p>ENCOUNTER WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CFU, THE PRO-ZANU- </p><p>PF ZIMBABWEAN FARMERS\' UNION ZFU), AND THE ZAMBIAN JOINT </p><p>RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE (ZJRI), WHICH VOWLES </p><p>REPRESENTED.  HE SAID THAT THE CFU HAD RAISED THREE MAIN </p><p>POINTS: THE NEW ARTICLE 8 REGULATIONS (THAT PERMIT FARM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03691  01 OF 02  130533Z </p><p>SEIZURE WITHIN 90 DAYS WITHOUT PRIOR REDRESS TO THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURT); NEW REGULATIONS LIMITING THE </p><p>MAXIMUM SIZE OF FARMS; AND THE LACK OF CFU COURT ACCESS </p><p>FOLLOWING THE SUPREME COURT RULING THROWING OUT THE </p><p>RIGHT OF THE CFU TO CONTEST THE FAST-TRACK LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS.  THE CFU ALSO </p><p>PRESENTED ITS MOST RECENT PRODUCTION ASSESSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) VOWLES SAID THAT THE SADC MINISTERS REACTED BY </p><p>POSING "TOUGH" AND DETAILED QUESTIONS TO THE CFU, WHILE </p><p>LOBBING ONLY A FEW SOFTBALLS TO THE ZFU AND ZJRI.  HE </p><p>TERMED THE GENERAL SADC REACTION AS UNSYMPATHETIC, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NOT HOSTILE.  THE UNDERLYING THEME SEEMED TO </p><p>BE, "NOW THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED ON THE </p><p>LEGALITY OF THE REFORMS, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?"  ZFU </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT WAS BY CONTRAST BOTH HOSTILE AND </p><p>AGGRESSIVE, SNEERING AT THE CFU PRODUCTION ASSESSMENT </p><p>AND INSISTING THAT LOST PRODUCTION FROM "WHITES" WOULD </p><p>BE MORE OFFSET BY THE PRODUCTION FROM ENFRANCHISED </p><p>"BLACKS" RESETTLED ON FERTILE LANDS AND SUPPORTED BY GOZ </p><p>FUNDS AND AGRICULTURAL INPUTS.

(C) THE COMMUNIQUE (WHICH WE HAVE FAXED TO AF/S) WAS </p><p>EVEN MORE OF A POWDER PUFF THAN THE ONE THAT EMERGED </p><p>FROM THE SEPTEMBER SADC HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING </p><p>(REFTEL).  CHAIRPERSON LILIAN PATEL, THE MALAWIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER, INDICATED "THAT RATHER THAN MEDIATING </p><p>BETWEEN THE PARTIES, THE MANDATE OF THE TASK FORCE WAS </p><p>TO FACILITATE DIALOGUE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS..."  THE </p><p>MINISTERS, AFTER A GOZ BRIEFING, "WELCOMED THE IMPROVED </p><p>ATMOSPHERE OF CALM AND STABILITY."  THE MINISTERS "WERE </p><p>GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT VIOLENCE ON THE FARMS HAD </p><p>REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THAT THE FEW REPORTED </p><p>INCIDENTS WERE BEING DEALT WITH UNDER THE CRIMINAL </p><p>JUSTICE SYSTEM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, </p><p>IRRESPECTIVE OF THE POLITICAL AFFILIATION OF THE ALLEGED </p><p>PERPETRATORS."  THEY ALSO "WELCOMED THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>DECISION MADE IN NOVEMBER 2001, DECLARING THAT THE </p><p>(REFORM PROGRAM) WAS LAWFUL AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MINISTERS, IN A VERY WELCOMING MOOD, ALSO </p><p>"WELCOMED LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER MECHANISMS PUT IN PLACE </p><p>TO GUARD AGAINST VIOLENCE AND ENSURE TRANSPARENCY..." </p><p>THE MINISTERS "EXPRESSED CONCERN AT DISTORTED AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03691  02 OF 02  130534Z </p><p>NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF ZIMBABWE PROJECTED BY REGIONAL </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA."  REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED EARLIER AT THE HEAD </p><p>OF STATE LEVEL, "IT WAS NOTED THAT MECHANISMS WERE </p><p>ALREADY IN PLACE FOR PARTIES TO INTERACT..."  THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE RECALLED THE 2000 SADC SUMMIT DECISION </p><p>OPPOSING SANCTIONS AGAINST ZIMBABWE, REITERATED THE </p><p>MINISTERS\' OPPOSITION TO SANCTIONS, AND "CALLED UPON ALL </p><p>CONCERNED PARTIES TO REFRAIN FROM IMPOSING SANCTIONS </p><p>SUCH AS THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>BILL." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE FOLLOWING DELEGATES SIGNED THE COMMUNIQUE: </p><p>ANGOLAN DEPUTY MINISTERS OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE SERAO AND SAMBENI AND VICE MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE RUFINO; BOTSWANA FONMIN MERAFHE; MALAWI DEFENSE </p><p>MINSTER MUNYENYEMBE; MOZAMBICAN PRESIDENTIAL MINISTER </p><p>MADEIRA AND DEPUTY FONMIN PATRICIO; NAMIBIA\'S DEPUTY </p><p>FONMIN KALOMOH; SOUTH AFRICAN LABOR MINISTER MDLADLANA; </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE FONMIN MUDENGE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WE CANNOT AGREE WITH SUMBANA THAT THE VISIT WAS </p><p>GOOD, OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT.  IN FACT, IT IS HARD TO </p><p>SEE THE VISIT AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A NON-EVENT AT </p><p>BEST, AND AT WORST A STEP BACKWARD ON SADC\'S PART FROM </p><p>THE TOUGH ISSUES AT HAND.  AS A RESULT, THE GOZ ONCE </p><p>AGAIN MANAGED TO CONTROL THE AGENDA AND FINAL COMMUNIQUE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03691  02 OF 02  130534Z </p><p>TO ITS ADVANTAGE.  IT MAY BE TOO SOON TO WRITE THE SADC </p><p>INITIATIVE OFF AS FAILED, BUT UNLESS FUTURE MISSIONS ARE </p><p>WILLING TO TAKE A HARDER LINE AND OPT FOR SOLUTIONS </p><p>RATHER THAN REGIONAL SOLIDARITY, WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS </p><p>PROCESS TO YIELD ANY MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS TO ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MULTIPLYING PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
