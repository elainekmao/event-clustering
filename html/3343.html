THE FAO\'S DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM BUDGET AND EVALUATION, </p><p>TONY WADE, RESPONDED AT LENGTH IN WRITING TO THE U.S. </p><p>DEMARCHE (REFTEL B) ON THE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE FAO/WHO </p><p>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION.  THE FULL TEXT OF HIS </p><p>RESPONSE IS GIVEN BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>JULY 15, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MS. HEILEMAN, </p><p> </p><p>I REFER TO OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE EVALUATION OF </p><p>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND OTHER FAO AND WHO WORK IN FOOD </p><p>STANDARDS, INCLUDING MY E-MAIL IN PARTICULAR, TO YOUR FAX OF </p><p>25 JUNE 2002. WE MUCH APPRECIATE THE INTEREST THAT THE US </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03594  01 OF 02  221223Z </p><p>AND MANY OTHER MEMBER COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES </p><p>ARE TAKING ON THIS EVALUATION, WHICH GREATLY UNDERLINES ITS </p><p>IMPORTANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CODEX </p><p>REFLECTS DIRECTLY ON NATIONAL INTEREST HAS MEANT THAT WE </p><p>HAVE HAD TO INSIST QUITE STRONGLY ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>EVALUATION FROM ANY ONE COUNTRY OR INTEREST GROUP. THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBER COUNTRIES TO DISCUSS AND ACT ON THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE EXTENSIVE IN THE FAO AND WHO </p><p>GOVERNING BODIES AND IN CODEX ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>HOWEVER  I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THE US SHOULD REQUEST </p><p>AN  EVALUATION  WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE  MANAGEMENT  OF  THE </p><p>CODEX  ALIMENTARIUS. IN OUR VIEW, THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO  BE </p><p>IN  LINE  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE HELMS-BIDEN LEGISLATION </p><p>WHICH CALLS ON THE UN SYSTEM TO EVALUATE ALL PROGRAMS WITH A </p><p>VIEW   TO   ENSURING   THEIR   "CONTINUING   RELEVANCE   AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS" AND FOR THEIR TERMINATION IN THE  EVENT  THAT </p><p>THEY  DO NOT MEET THIS CRITERIA. IN POSING QUESTIONS ON  THE </p><p>PROGRAM  PRIORITIES AND MODALITIES, THE EVALUATION DOES  NOT </p><p>PREJUDGE THE CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN. </p><p> </p><p>IT  IS  PERHAPS  ALSO WORTH BEARING IN  MIND  THAT,  IF  THE </p><p>EVALUATION HAD NOT ADOPTED THIS HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND HAD </p><p>INSTEAD  FOCUSED NARROWLY ON CODEX, IT WOULD  HAVE  EXCLUDED </p><p>VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES SUCH AS THE CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDS OF </p><p>DEVELOPING MEMBER COUNTRIES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH  OF  THEIR </p><p>PEOPLE, MEET EXPORT REQUIREMENTS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES  AND </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN CODEX ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>THE   FINAL  POINT  OF  THE  US  AID-MEMOIR,  EXPRESSES  THE </p><p>EXPECTATION  THAT THE EVALUATION WILL LEAD TO WHO  PROVIDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03594  01 OF 02  221223Z </p><p>INCREASED  RESOURCES FOR CODEX. IN OUR VIEW THIS  REINFORCES </p><p>THE  NEED FOR A FULL EVALUATION. FOR BOTH FAO AND WHO IT  IS </p><p>CLEAR THAT FOR AN EVALUATION TO JUSTIFY RESOURCE CHANGES, IT </p><p>NEEDS  TO  TAKE  A FUNDAMENTAL LOOK AT THE USEFULNESS  OF  A </p><p>PROGRAM TO ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>I  THEREFORE  HAVE  TO ADVISE THAT THE EVALUATION  TERMS  OF </p><p>REFERENCE  CANNOT  BE ADJUSTED TO REFOCUS  IT  AS  SOLELY  A </p><p>MANAGEMENT  STUDY. HOWEVER, AS DISCUSSED WHEN THE EVALUATION </p><p>TEAM  VISITED  WASHINGTON, AT THE FAO PROGRAM COMMITTEE  AND </p><p>NOW  IN  THE CODEX EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, THE EVALUATION  WILL </p><p>DEFINITELY   INCLUDE  THE  EXAMINATION  OF  MANAGEMENT   AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCEDURES IN CODEX AND,  IN </p><p>FACT,  THE  CHECK  LIST  OF POINTS PROVIDED  BY  THE  US  IN </p><p>"ELEMENTS  OF  AN  APPROPRIATE CODEX  MANAGEMENT  STUDY"  IS </p><p>HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>IN  SOME  AREAS THE EVALUATION MAY RAISE BASIC QUESTIONS  ON </p><p>TYPES  OF STANDARDS TO BE DEVELOPED, OR ON THE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MANY BE REQUIRED. THESE ARE  MATTERS  ON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0087 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03594  02 OF 02  221224Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  ANHR-00  EB-00    UTED-00  HHS-01   TEDE-00 </p><p>      IO-00    OIC-02   STR-00   TEST-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------CE727E  221224Z /38 </p><p>R 221222Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5004 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2230 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD </p><p>STATE FOR EB HANS KLEMM, IO/S PODOLSKY AND IO/EDA JOHNSON </p><p>USDA FOR DR.

THERE  CAN </p><p>ALWAYS  BE GREATER CONSULTATION AND IN THIS CASE MORE  WOULD </p><p>CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE. HOWEVER, WE ARE WORKING UNDER </p><p>SEVERE  TIME  CONSTRAINTS TO COMPLETE THE MAIN WORK  OF  THE </p><p>EVALUATION  IN  LINE  WITH  THE  MEETING  SCHEDULE  OF   THE </p><p>GOVERNING  BODIES. A HIGHLY CONSULTATIVE APPROACH  IS  BEING </p><p>FOLLOWED   IN   THE   WORK   OF   THE   EVALUATION   THROUGH </p><p>QUESTIONNAIRES  TO ALL COUNTRIES AND OTHER  STAKEHOLDERS  AS </p><p>WELL  AS  EXTENSIVE  COUNTRY VISITS.  TWENTY-FOUR  COUNTRIES </p><p>THROUGHOUT  THE  WORLD  AND THE EU COMMISSION  ARE  INVOLVED </p><p>(AFRICA:  COTE D\'IVOIRE, MOZAMBIQUE, SENEGAL, SOUTH  AFRICA, </p><p>TANZANIA;  THE  AMERICAS:  ARGENTINA  CANADA,  COSTA   RICA, </p><p>MEXICO,  USA;  ASIA  PACIFIC: AUSTRALIA,  BANGLADESH,  FIJI, </p><p>INDIA,  JAPAN,  PHILIPPINES, THAILAND; EUROPE:  EU,  FRANCE, </p><p>NETHERLANDS,  HUNGARY, SWITZERLAND;  NEAR  EAST:  EGYPT  AND </p><p>JORDAN). </p><p> </p><p>AS  YOU  KNOW,  THE EVALUATION WAS DISCUSSED  AT  THE  CODEX </p><p>ALIMENTARIUS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON 26 JUNE. THIS  GAVE  THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO ADDRESS THE WIDE RANGE  OF  THEIR </p><p>CONCERNS.  THE  SECTION  OF THE EXECUTIVE  COMMITTEE  REPORT </p><p>ADDRESSING THE EVALUATION ITEM IS ANNEXED FOR YOUR  EASE  OF </p><p>REFERENCE.  YOU  WILL  SEE  THAT  THE  EXECUTIVE   COMMITTEE </p><p>WELCOMED  THE EVALUATION AND THE RESPONSES MADE BY  FAO  AND </p><p>WHO  ON  ENSURING REGIONAL REPRESENTATION IN THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>EXPERT   PANEL.  MEMBERS  ALSO  RAISED  ISSUES  THAT   WOULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03594  02 OF 02  221224Z </p><p>CONTRIBUTE  TO  THE  PROGRESS  OF  THE  EVALUATION  AND  ITS </p><p>EVENTUAL  OUTCOME. AT THE SAME TIME THE REPORT DOES  REFLECT </p><p>CERTAIN  OF YOUR CONCERNS, INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS OF SCIENCE- </p><p>BASED CODEX STANDARDS AND THAT CONSIDERATION OF CULTURAL AND </p><p>ETHICAL  ISSUES SHOULD NOT SIDE-LINE THE MAJOR AIMS  OF  THE </p><p>EVALUATION. WITHOUT PRE-JUDGING THE EVALUATION, IT WOULD NOT </p><p>BE TOO SURPRISING IF THE EVALUATION FINDINGS WERE TO CONFIRM </p><p>THE VIEW THAT THESE ISSUES ARE NOT OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE  TO </p><p>CODEX. </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE  BE  ASSURED THAT WITH DUE REGARD TO THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>OF THE EVALUATION, FAO AND ITS PARTNER WHO WILL BE INSISTING </p><p>ON  EVIDENCE-BASED FINDINGS FROM THE EVALUATION  WHICH  TAKE </p><p>FULL   ACCOUNT   OF   MEMBERS\'  VIEWS   EXPRESSED   IN   THE </p><p>QUESTIONNAIRES AND COUNTRY VISITS. WE WILL ALSO  BE  LOOKING </p><p>TO    THE   EVALUATION   FOR   REALISTIC   AND   OPERATIONAL </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH WILL HELP US STRENGTHEN FAO  AND  WHO </p><p>SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES IN THE AREAS OF FOOD SAFETY AND </p><p>RELATED ISSUES OF THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDS IN TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>WE  REMAIN  AVAILABLE FOR TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER FURTHER  AT </p><p>YOUR CONVENIENCE AND HAVE COPIED OUR REPLY TO WHO SINCE THEY </p><p>RECEIVED A SIMILAR LETTER FROM THE US MISSION IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>YOURS SINCERELY, </p><p> </p><p>TONY WADE </p><p>DIRECTOR </p><p>OFFICE PROGRAM BUDGET AND EVALUATION. </p><p> </p><p>TAMLYN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03594  02 OF 02  221224Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03594 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
