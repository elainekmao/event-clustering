<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES A/S TURNER FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p>ALSO FOR OES SBRANDEL AND KSHIPPE </p><p>AF FOR DAS ROBERT PERRY </p><p>ABIDJAN FOR RHAWKINS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, PREL, EFIS, AORC, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: USG PARTICIPATION IN THE JUNE 17-19 SUPER </p><p>PREP COM IN ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 85964 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. Minister of State for the Environment Imeh Okopido </p><p>recently called me concerning the level of USG representation </p><p>for the June 17-19 Super Prep Com Ministerial to be hosted by </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo.   Okopido told me that he has </p><p>not received a formal response to his March 22 invitation </p><p>letter to Assistant Secretary Turner, but he had heard </p><p>informally that OES was not sending anyone from Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  As noted in reftel, the Super Prep Com is an important </p><p>step toward the World Summit on Sustainable Development later </p><p>this year.  The African Process, an initiative of eleven </p><p>African countries, is aimed at establishing programs on ocean </p><p>pollution from coastal sources in the regions from East </p><p>Africa around the Cape to West Africa.  It represents a </p><p>serious initiative by Africans to address their environmental </p><p>problems in a regional way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Okopido is one of the continent\'s most knowledgeable and </p><p>dynamic leaders on the environment.  He has focussed </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s attention on important issues like gas </p><p>flaring.  A positive Super Prep Com (which by Nigerian </p><p>definition would require adequate representation from the </p><p>U.S.) will help solidify the commitment of the Nigerian </p><p>government and President Obasanjo in protecting the African </p><p>environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Our experience in working with President Obasanjo on </p><p>HIV/AIDS is instructive.  His interest and commitment grew as </p><p>he attended and even hosted international conferences with </p><p>high-level visitors such as former U.S. Presidents Carter and </p><p>Clinton and UN Secretary General Annan.  Now President </p><p>Obasanjo is the driving force among African Heads of State on </p><p>this critical issue.  He could serve the same role on the </p><p>environment.  Moreover, he is an architect of NEPAD, and our </p><p>showing high-level interest in the Super Prep Com will </p><p>encourage him to inject environmental concerns into NEPAD </p><p>deliberations.  In short, a successful Super Prep Com can be </p><p>an important step in mobilizing Nigeria\'s substantial </p><p>diplomatic and regional influence toward more effective </p><p>environmental policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. We are particularly hopeful that the Assistant Secretary </p><p>can attend at least the June 19 Ministerial.  If he cannot, </p><p>we would ask support in finding other high-level </p><p>participation perhaps from the EPA or other offices in the </p><p>USG.  We would also ask that USAID send an expert from </p><p>Washington rather than ask a local USAID official to </p><p>participate in the Abuja Super Prep Com.  USAID Nigeria has </p><p>no one on staff with the requisite experience, as environment </p><p>issues are not covered by the Nigeria transitional strategic </p><p>objectives. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
