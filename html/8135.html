DART Field Team West arrived in Al Hillah on 11 May.  On </p><p>12 May, the DART visited a maternity and children\'s hospital </p><p>in Al Hillah, met with some local wakils, and met with </p><p>representatives of Save the Children/U.S. who were returning </p><p>through Al Hillah from a recent assessment of An Najaf and </p><p>Karbala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART visited the Babylon Maternity and Children\'s </p><p>Hospital in Al Hillah on 12 May and found it had full </p><p>electricity and water and sufficient stocks of most drugs </p><p>for one month.  However, it is precariously short of oxygen, </p><p>IV fluids, antibiotics, and Pentostam, and has no blood- </p><p>testing capabilities.  Also, the hospital suffers from a </p><p>shortage of fuel for its generator and ambulance and endures </p><p>chronic incubator problems and shortages of vaccines.  The </p><p>sporadic immunization program ended at the onset of war, and </p><p>the Ministry of Health (MOH) has yet to pay salaries.  Many </p><p>of the medical staff, who continued working throughout the </p><p>war, often thwarting would-be looters, reside at the </p><p>hospital to avoid the security risk of commuting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The 380-bed hospital charges small fees for drugs in </p><p>order to raise funds for overhead and future drug </p><p>procurements from the MOH.  Prior to the war, the hospital </p><p>had to pay 20 percent of its revenue to the Ministry of </p><p>Defense and five percent to the MOH.  The hospital sees 150 </p><p>to 200 patients a day, though during the war that number </p><p>increased to 350 because many health centers had closed. </p><p>Approximately 30 to 35 babies are born at the hospital each </p><p>day.  There are 30 specialist doctors and 40 residents, half </p><p>of both are women.  The other two hospitals in Al Hillah are </p><p>the Surgical Hospital and the General Hospital, which has a </p><p>pediatric ward.  All of Al Hillah\'s primary health centers </p><p>are open. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The greatest problem for children is diarrhea.  The four </p><p>doctors with whom we spoke said the rate was slightly higher </p><p>than normal for this time of year.  A gynecologist at the </p><p>hospital, said that about 80 percent of the women she treats </p><p>are anemic.  As a result, there is a significant birth- </p><p>weight problem.  She said hypertension and bleeding were two </p><p>other serious problems among women. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Last week, CARE provided a two-month supply of </p><p>therapeutic milk and high-protein biscuits, and Medecins </p><p>Sans Frontieres visited recently, bringing milk and feeding </p><p>bottles.  The International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>(ICRC) has also visited.  The staff said the Iraqi Red </p><p>Crescent Society was no longer functioning, and that it had </p><p>only worked on a limited basis before the war. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ASSESSMENT BY SAVE THE CHILDREN </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  A four-person team from Save the Children/U.S. came </p><p>through Al Hillah on their way back to Baghdad in order to </p><p>debrief team west on their two-day rapid assessments of </p><p>Karbala and An Najaf (two persons traveled to each city.) </p><p>Save/U.S. is planning on setting up small offices, comprised </p><p>of two expats and a small number of national staff in </p><p>Karbala and An Najaf. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In Karbala, Save/U.S. visited a pediatric hospital, a </p><p>number of schools, the Ministry of Education, religious </p><p>leaders, and civil affairs teams.  The main problems in </p><p>Karbala include a shortage of life-saving drugs, increasing </p><p>cases of diarrhea (one doctor in the main hospital believes </p><p>that it is reaching epidemic proportions), severe lack of </p><p>protein in the diets of the hospital patients, and water and </p><p>sanitation issues (including lack of sanitation and </p><p>treatment of water facilities.)  Save/U.S. did not encounter </p><p>any issues regarding unexploded ordnance (UXOs) in schools, </p><p>however, targeted water and sanitation interventions are </p><p>needed.  The Save/U.S. also found pockets of internally </p><p>displaced persons (IDPs) living in empty lots around the </p><p>city; most seemed to be old caseload IDPs. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In terms of implementation plans in Karbala, Save/U.S. </p><p>would like to focus efforts on providing life-saving drugs, </p><p>small equipment, materials, and fresh food to hospitals, </p><p>providing support to the referral and supply system for </p><p>clinics, and addressing water and sanitation needs in </p><p>schools.  Save/U.S. also reported that tensions are on the </p><p>rise between the local population and Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In An Najaf, the Save/U.S. team visited various </p><p>hospitals, schools and religious leaders.  They found </p><p>increased cases of diarrhea, suspected cholera cases, </p><p>problems with sanitation and waste disposal, and suspected </p><p>problems with UXOs in school buildings.  In the main </p><p>pediatric hospital, 70 percent of patients (about 170 per </p><p>day) have diarrhea.  Of those, 10 to 20 percent are severe </p><p>(some seem to have symptoms of cholera.)  About three to </p><p>four children per week are admitted to the hospital with </p><p>injuries related to UXOs. </p><p> </p><p>10.  In An Najaf, the sanitation and waste disposal system </p><p>is working at full capacity; however, this only meets 20 </p><p>percent of the city\'s needs.  Save/U.S. was told that </p><p>although many of the schools are open (about 50 percent of </p><p>schools in the city are open at this time), parents are </p><p>afraid to send their children because of possible UXOs in </p><p>buildings and lack of security in the area (mainly dealing </p><p>with looters and rumors of kidnappings.)  Although looting </p><p>has been fairly minimal in An Najaf, it does continue to </p><p>occur.  The Ministry of Social Affairs was looted of its </p><p>contents on 12 May; all records were also apparently </p><p>destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>11.  According to Save/U.S., the religious community has </p><p>stepped up in a very positive way since the war began.  They </p><p>have been able to keep peace and cohesion amongst community </p><p>members, which has resulted in lower incidents of looting </p><p>and continued provision of basic services to the community. </p><p>Save/U.S. plans to provide medical assistance to some of the </p><p>hospitals with the most need and assist the Ministry of </p><p>Social Affairs to get up and running again, (assistance with </p><p>small-scale repair of the nursery/mental hospital for </p><p>children and adolescents in town). </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>12.  According to food wakils (distribution agents) in Al </p><p>Hillah, the public distribution system (PDS) is functioning </p><p>and all wakils are in place for future ration distributions. </p><p>The last food distribution was conducted during the first </p><p>week in May.  Certain commodity shortages were reported and </p><p>some recipients voiced concern regarding the quality of </p><p>wheat and rice. </p><p> </p><p>13.  According to U.N. World Food Program national staff, </p><p>the two major Al Hillah food warehouses are intact though </p><p>minor repairs are needed such as locks and windows. Although </p><p>the warehouses are stocked, food distributions are hampered </p><p>by the presence of Coalition forces that have established </p><p>themselves inside the warehouse. Current warehouse </p><p>operations are allowed by coalition troops, but are limited </p><p>to approximately 60 trucks per day. Normal warehouse </p><p>operations can handle approximately 300 to 400 trucks per </p><p>day.  The DART has also learned from Coalition forces that </p><p>this problem has been recognized and the coalition is </p><p>looking into correcting the problem.  The DART will monitor </p><p>the issue. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The grain silo in Al Hillah is intact and stocked with </p><p>an estimated one-month supply of grain.  All fifteen mills </p><p>that serve the Babil governate are operational with </p><p>electricity and back-up generators. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Several issues of concern include the shortages of </p><p>flour bags at the mills, the shortage of fuel, an increase </p><p>in fuel prices, and lack of salaries for Ministry of Trade </p><p>personnel. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
