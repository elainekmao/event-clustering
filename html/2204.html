REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A SEVERAL-HOUR RAMPAGE THROUGH BULAWAYO ON NOVEMBER 16, </p><p>WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS BURNED TO THE GROUND THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC\'S OFFICE, RANSACKED THE OFFICE OF THE CITY\'S MAYOR, </p><p>BEAT THOSE SELLING AND READING INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS, AND SMASHED </p><p>CAR WINDSHIELDS.  THEY WERE ESCORTED BY RIOT POLICE WHO DID NOT </p><p>INTERVENE.  IN RETALIATION, MDC SUPPORTERS BURNED DOWN A PRIVATE </p><p>COLLEGE OWNED BY A SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIAL AND A TRUCK BELONGING </p><p>TO A GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER, AND CLASHES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS </p><p>CONTINUED INTO THE NIGHT IN THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS.  AN UNEASY </p><p>CALM HAS RETURNED TO ZIMBABWE\'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, BUT FEW </p><p>OBSERVERS BELIEVE THE VIOLENCE IS OVER.  REMARKS BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE ON NOVEMBER 19 WILL NOT HELP MATTERS, AS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>BLAMED THE RECENT MURDER OF A PROMINENT WAR VETERAN ON THE MDC, </p><p>ACCUSED THE OPPOSITION PARTY OF OPERATING TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS </p><p>AND TORTURING ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, AND INSISTING THAT THE MDC\'S </p><p>"DAYS ARE NUMBERED."  THE MDC\'S NATIONAL COORDINATOR BELIEVES THE </p><p>GOZ IS TRYING TO FRAME THE MDC AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WHICH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03463  01 OF 03  191923Z </p><p>RECEIVES FOREIGN FUNDING IN VIOLATION OF ZIMBABWEAN LAW, THUS </p><p>PROVIDING A LEGAL BASIS FOR OUTLAWING THE PARTY AND PROHIBITING IT </p><p>FROM CONTESTING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  FOR OUR PART, WE </p><p>SURMISE THAT INTIMIDATION GUARANTEEING A ZANU-PF "VICTORY" AT THE </p><p>POLLS MAY BE MUGABE\'S BOTTOM LINE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WAR VETERANS RAMPAGE THROUGH BULAWAYO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SEVERAL HUNDRED WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS </p><p>RAMPAGED THROUGH THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OF BULAWAYO ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 16 AFTER MEETING WITH SENIOR RULING PARTY OFFICIALS ABOUT </p><p>THE MURDER OF WAR VETERAN LEADER CAIN NKALA (REFTEL).  ESCORTED BY </p><p>RIOT POLICE WHO APPARENTLY DID NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM, THE MOB </p><p>RANDOMLY ATTACKED WITH STICKS VENDORS AND READERS OF INDEPENDENT </p><p>NEWSPAPERS AND BROKE CAR WINDSHIELDS, FORCING A NUMBER OF </p><p>FRIGHTENED BUSINESS OWNERS TO SHUT DOWN.  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, ONE WHITE ELDERLY MAN WAS BEATEN BY THE MOB, AND THERE </p><p>WERE REPORTS THAT A GERMAN AID WORKER WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN THE </p><p>VICINITY WAS ALSO ACCOSTED.  THE CROWD PROCEEDED TO CITY HALL, </p><p>WHERE SEVERAL MARCHERS RANSACKED THE OFFICE OF MAYOR JAPHET </p><p>NDABENI-NCUBE, ELECTED IN SEPTEMBER ON THE TICKET OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC). NDABENI-NCUBE </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE ESCAPED JUST BEFORE EIGHT MEN COMPLETELY RANSACKED </p><p>HIS OFFICE -- HE LATER FOUND IMPORTANT PAPERS OUTSIDE IN A FLOWER </p><p>GARDEN -- AND STOLE HIS BRIEFCASE.  HE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO </p><p>POLICE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD, BUT THEY HAD YET TO APPEAR BY </p><p>NOVEMBER 19, THREE DAYS LATER.  THE MOB CAPPED OFF ITS DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>AFTERNOON BY THROWING PETROL BOMBS AT THE OFFICE BUILDING OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), REDUCING IT TO A </p><p>SMOLDERING SHELL, AS POLICE STOOD BY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03463  01 OF 03  191923Z </p><p> </p><p>RETALIATION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE BURNING OF THE MDC OFFICES SPARKED RETALIATION FROM </p><p>ANGRY MDC YOUTHS, WHO BURNED DOWN A PRIVATE COLLEGE OWNED BY </p><p>SIKHANYISO NDLOVU, ZANU-PF\'S ACTING POLITICAL COMMISSAR AND SET </p><p>ALIGHT A TRUCK BELONGING TO THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER </p><p>"THE CHRONICLE."  A CROWD OF SEVERAL THOUSAND BULAWAYO RESIDENTS </p><p>THEN GATHERED IN FRONT OF ZANU-PF OFFICES, INTENT ON DOING DAMAGE, </p><p>BUT DISPERSED AFTER A TENSE STANDOFF WITH RIOT POLICE.   SHARI </p><p>EPPEL, DIRECTOR OF THE BULAWAYO OFFICE OF THE RESPECTED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AMANI TRUST, SAID SKIRMISHES BETWEEN ZANU-PF </p><p>AND MDC SUPPORTERS CONTINUED INTO THE NIGHT IN SOME OF THE CITY\'S </p><p>HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS, BUT THAT THE SITUATION HAD CALMED DOWN BY </p><p>THE NEXT MORNING.  SHE SAID MOST OF THE WAR VETERANS AND RULING </p><p>PARTY THUGS WHO HAD STARTED THE TROUBLE ARRIVED ON TRAINS THE </p><p>NIGHT BEFORE, WHILE A PROMINENT INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST TOLD US THE </p><p>TROUBLEMAKERS WERE "NOT FROM HERE." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WENT ON THEIR </p><p>RAMPAGE AFTER RULING PARTY POLITBURO MEMBER -- AND FORMER MINISTER </p><p>OF HOME AFFAIRS -- DUMISO DABENGWA REPORTEDLY WHIPPED THEM INTO AN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7590 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03463  02 OF 03  191923Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4070AE  191924Z /48 </p><p>O 191433Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0318 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03463  02 OF 03  191923Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNEASY CALM RETURNS TO BULAWAYO AS CRACKDOWN ON MDC </p><p>INTENSIFIES </p><p> </p><p>EMOTIONAL STATE.  ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY </p><p>"THE HERALD," DABENGWA DESCRIBED NKALA\'S MURDER AS TERRORISM, AND </p><p>CALLED ON THOSE PRESENT TO "CRUSH THIS TERRORISM...IN ITS INFANCY. </p><p>NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS COUNTRY WHILE WE ARE ALIVE, </p><p>THOSE WHO THINK THEY CAN RULE IT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF WHITES </p><p>SHOULD FORGET IT."  ZANU-PF\'S ACTING POLITICAL COMMISSAR </p><p>SIKHANYISO NDLOVU TOLD US HE HAD URGED THE CROWD TO MARCH WITH A </p><p>POLICE ESCORT TO ENSURE THAT CRIMINAL ELEMENTS COULD NOT JOIN AND </p><p>ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES WHICH WOULD DISCREDIT THEM.  ASKED WHY THE </p><p>POLICE DID NOT INTERVENE TO PREVENT THE MOB FROM BEATING PEOPLE OR </p><p>DESTROYING PROPERTY, NDLOVU CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE OUTNUMBERED. </p><p> </p><p>UNEASY CALM IN BULAWAYO </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SHARI EPPEL SAID THAT AN UNEASY CALM RETURNED TO BULAWAYO </p><p>OVER THE WEEKEND.  SHE WAS GLAD NKALA HAD BEEN DECLARED A NATIONAL </p><p>HERO BY THE RULING PARTY POLITBURO.  THAT DEVELOPMENT ENSURED THAT </p><p>THE "CIRCUS" MOVED TO HARARE FOR THE NOVEMBER 18 BURIAL OF NKALA </p><p>AT HEROES\' ACRE AND ALLOWED TENSIONS IN ZIMBABWE\'S SECOND-LARGEST </p><p>CITY TO COOL.  EPPEL DESCRIBED BULAWAYO RESIDENTS AS ANXIOUS AND </p><p>IN A "WAIT AND SEE" MODE. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE PULLS NO PUNCHES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03463  02 OF 03  191923Z </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AT NKALA\'S BURIAL, PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS NOT IN A </p><p>CONCILIATORY MOOD.  IN VENOMOUS REMARKS, HE BLAMED THE LATE WAR </p><p>VETERAN\'S MURDER ON THE MDC, WHICH HE SAID OPERATES TERRORIST </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ZIMBABWE AND REGULARLY TORTURES </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  HE INSISTED THAT NKALA\'S DEATH WAS THE RESULT </p><p>OF AN "ORCHESTRATED, MUCH WIDER AND CAREFULLY PLANNED TERRORIST </p><p>PLOT BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ENEMY FORCES WITH PLENTY OF FUNDING </p><p>FROM...COMMERCIAL FARMERS" AND INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  "THE MDC AND THEIR SUPPORTERS," HE VOWED, "SHOULD </p><p>KNOW THAT THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED."  MDC MP DAVID COLTART </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN TO US THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S COMMENTS COULD SPARK </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE IN BULAWAYO.  MEANWHILE, A REPORTER AND A </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHER FROM THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" WERE ARRESTED ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 18 PRIOR TO THEIR PUBLISHING AN INTERVIEW WITH SOMEONE </p><p>WHO CLAIMED TO KNOW THE FULL DETAILS OF NKALA\'S ABDUCTION AND </p><p>MURDER.  GOVERNMENT MEDIA ALLEGED THAT THE "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>JOURNALISTS HAD TORTURED AN INDIVIDUAL INTO CONFESSING THAT HE WAS </p><p>A CIO AGENT AND THAT THEY HAD MURDERED NKALA.  POLICE SEIZED THE </p><p>REPORTER\'S NOTES OF THE INTERVIEW AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER\'S PICTURE </p><p>OF THE INTERVIEWEE, AND THE TWO JOURNALISTS WERE STILL IN </p><p>DETENTION ON NOVEMBER 19. </p><p> </p><p>BAN THE MDC </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) MDC NATIONAL COORDINATOR ISAAC MAPOSA TOLD POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF ON NOVEMBER 19 THAT 30 MDC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES </p><p>HAD BEEN DETAINED SO FAR IN CONNECTION WITH THE NKALA MURDER, THE </p><p>MOST SENIOR OF WHOM WAS FLETCHER DULINI-NCUBE, THE PARTY\'S </p><p>NATIONAL TREASURER.  MAPOSA DISMISSED GOZ ACCUSATIONS OF MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03463  02 OF 03  191923Z </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN NKALA\'S MURDER, SAYING A RELIABLE WAR VETERAN BASED </p><p>IN BULAWAYO HAD TOLD THE OPPOSITION PARTY IN CONFIDENCE THAT HE </p><p>HAD BEEN KILLED BY OTHER WAR VETERANS.  MAPOSA ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>FEELING FRIGHTENED BY THE WEEK\'S TURN OF EVENTS, NOTING THAT ONE </p><p>IS NOT DEALING WITH A RATIONAL, REASONABLE GOVERNMENT BUT, RATHER, </p><p>ONE WILLING TO TORTURE AND KILL THOSE WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH IT. </p><p>MAPOSA BELIEVES THE GOVERNMENT\'S STRATEGY IS TO BUILD A CASE </p><p>AGAINST THE MDC AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION BY TORTURING MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS INTO MAKING FALSE CONFESSIONS IN THE NKALA CASE AND BY </p><p>IDENTIFYING ANY FOREIGN SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE PARTY, WHICH </p><p>WOULD PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR OUTLAWING THE MDC AND PREVENTING </p><p>IT FROM CONTESTING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>MDC RECEIVES FOREIGN SOURCES OF FUNDING, MAPOSA SAID YES, BUT ONLY </p><p>THREE PEOPLE IN THE PARTY ARE AWARE OF THE DETAILS: HIMSELF, </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, AND SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE. </p><p>MAPOSA WAS CLEARLY ANXIOUS THAT HE WOULD BE HAULED IN AND FORCED </p><p>TO REVEAL WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT THIS TOPIC. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) TENSIONS HAD BEEN BUILDING IN BULAWAYO FOR TEN DAYS, AS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT/ZANU-PF ORCHESTRATED A CAMPAIGN BLAMING THE MDC FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7592 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03463  03 OF 03  191924Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4070B3  191924Z /48 </p><p>O 191433Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0319 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03463  03 OF 03  191924Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNEASY CALM RETURNS TO BULAWAYO AS CRACKDOWN ON MDC </p><p>INTENSIFIES </p><p> </p><p>NKALA\'S MURDER.  ACCORDING TO SHARI EPPEL, MOST LOCAL RESIDENTS </p><p>ARE "100% CONVINCED" THAT IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB.  NO EVIDENCE -- </p><p>OTHER THAN A CONFESSION FROM TWO MDC SUPPORTERS WHICH MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN ELICITED UNDER DURESS OR THROUGH BRIBERY -- HAS BEEN </p><p>PRESENTED IMPLICATING ANYONE IN THE MURDER.  THE FAILURE OF POLICE </p><p>TO PREVENT THE WAR VETERANS FROM GUTTING THE MDC BUILDING, </p><p>RANSACKING THE MAYOR\'S OFFICE, AND BEATING PEOPLE AS THEY WENT -- </p><p>AND THEIR FAILURE EVEN TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT IN THE MAYOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE THREE DAYS AFTER THE FACT -- SUGGESTS GOZ SANCTION OR </p><p>COMPLIANCE. IT IS CLEAR THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH FOR THE </p><p>RESIDENTS OF BULAWAYO -- WHO HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>NEGLECT AND THE RULING PARTY\'S VIOLENT TACTICS IN THE PAST -- TO </p><p>POUR INTO THE STREETS, A FACT WHICH MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ZANU-PF </p><p>OFFICIALS BY SURPRISE.  THIS MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE NOVEMBER 16 </p><p>APPEALS FOR RESTRAINT BY HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO AND </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO.  BUT MUGABE\'S IRRESPONSIBLE </p><p>REMARKS AT THE NKALA FUNERAL SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, AND COULD VERY </p><p>WELL FORESHADOW A CRACKDOWN ON THE MDC OF THE KIND DESCRIBED BY </p><p>MAPOSA, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT THINK THAT MUGABE WISHES TO JETTISON </p><p>HIS LEGITIMACY BY COMPLETELY BANNING THE MDC FROM CONTESTING AN </p><p>ELECTION IN WHICH ALL THE LOGISTICAL AND LEGAL ADVANTAGES ACCRUE </p><p>TO ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03463  03 OF 03  191924Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
