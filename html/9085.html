KATHMANDU 1018 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1214 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 1132 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a June 30 meeting with the Ambassador, King </p><p>Gyanendra opened by apologizing for May 31 deportations of 18 </p><p>Tibetans (Ref A).  He characterized the decision to deport </p><p>the 18 as undertaken by a bureaucracy that "went off on its </p><p>own" in the "last minutes of the former government."  The </p><p>Government of Nepal has taken the matter very seriously, he </p><p>continued.  The deportations were "a bump on the road," the </p><p>King said, an aberration that does not reflect official </p><p>policy and which he assured the Ambassador should not happen </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On July 1, Abraham Abraham, Country Director for </p><p>UNHCR in Nepal, told the Ambassador that he expects 19 </p><p>Tibetans who were detained in western Nepal on June 24 (Ref </p><p>B) to arrive in Kathmandu later that evening and to be handed </p><p>over to UNHCR for onward travel to India.  Abhraham described </p><p>UNHCR as "very happy" with the treatment the refugees had </p><p>received from government officials so far, passing on reports </p><p>that they had been well fed and well cared for during their </p><p>detention.  Abraham emphasized that he believes the </p><p>low-profile approach adopted in this latest case and in the </p><p>successful processing of another 40 Tibetans on June 13 (Ref </p><p>C) is working well. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  The King\'s eagerness to emphasize that </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) policy remains unchanged </p><p>underscores the importance the GON attaches to </p><p>re-establishing its credibility on this matter.  We share </p><p>UNHCR\'s optimism that the smooth processing of transiting </p><p>Tibetans since May 31 indicates that the GON will maintain </p><p>its earlier policy toward asylum seekers and does not plan to </p><p>deport other Tibetans in the future.  Nonetheless, we will </p><p>continue to monitor the situation closely. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
