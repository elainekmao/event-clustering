<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006095 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/L - GEORGE SMITH </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR DOL/ILAB TINA FAULKNER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EIND, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE OF CHILD LABOR INFORMATION FOR TRADE AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ACT (GSP) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 168607 </p><p> </p><p>1.  As requested in reftel, Post is providing updated </p><p>information on child labor in Jordan.   Post has informed GOJ </p><p>that we are compiling the information for the report.  In </p><p>addition, we will meet with Ministry of Labor officials the </p><p>week of October 21 to discuss further. </p><p> </p><p>2.  During the past year, PolOff discussed the issue of child </p><p>labor with GOJ officials, local NGOs, labor leaders and ILO </p><p>officials.  In general, child labor is not a serious problem </p><p>in Jordan.  There were no significant developments in the </p><p>area of child labor during the past year.  The "worst forms" </p><p>of child labor, as defined by the ILO, are virtually </p><p>non-existent in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The following information is keyed to reftel, para F: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Jordan ratified ILO Convention 182 on April 20, 2000. </p><p>The minimum age for employment is 16.  According to Article </p><p>74 of the Labor Law, workers must be 18 for certain types of </p><p>employment i.e. "hazardous, exhausting or prejudicial to </p><p>health jobs" (in accordance with ILO Convention 182). </p><p> </p><p>B.  The Ministry of Labor has a Child Labor Unit and MOL </p><p>inspectors have judicial authority to fine and/or shut down </p><p>companies, according to Article 9 of the Labor Law. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Information requested from GOJ; Post is awaiting a GOJ </p><p>update and will report septel. </p><p> </p><p>D.  The Petra news agency reported October 15 that the </p><p>overall school attendance rate in Jordan is 92 percent, while </p><p>total secondary school attendance is 79 percent.  There is </p><p>compulsory attendance in school to age 16.  The dropout rate </p><p>for Jordanian children is 11 percent, according to the GOJ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  In July 2002, the Ministry of Labor issued a </p><p>comprehensive 80 page study entitled "A Report on the Status </p><p>of Child Labor in Jordan" for 2001.  This study included a </p><p>national survey on child labor within the framework of the </p><p>ILO/International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor </p><p>(IPEC).  The report, which is considered reliable by local </p><p>ILO officials and NGOs, states that 1.1 percent of females </p><p>and 13 percent of males aged 15-16 are working.  The majority </p><p>of this child labor is part-time work in auto maintenance, </p><p>"casual work" (such as helping out in family shops) and </p><p>tradecrafts such as carpentry.  "Selling", i.e. street </p><p>vendors, is a growing problem but constitutes a small </p><p>percentage (7 percent) of total child labor according to the </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The number of children working in the "worst kinds" of </p><p>child labor is negligible in Jordan, based on information </p><p>provided by human rights and labor activists.  The Ministry </p><p>of Labor is in the process of developing a strategic plan </p><p>concerning child labor. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
