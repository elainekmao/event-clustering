(U) This is an urgent action request; see para 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY: On January 30, Ambassador Jeter offered </p><p>condolences to Minister of Defense Danjuma for the loss of </p><p>life and property following explosions at the Ikeja </p><p>Cantonment.  Danjuma, giving his assessment after a visit to </p><p>the site the day before, said most victims were children and </p><p>that unexploded ordinance was the greatest immediate concern. </p><p> Danjuma said the Federal Government has established a </p><p>disaster relief fund and committee.  300m Naira was already </p><p>dedicated to the fund and the committee had dispatched </p><p>members to Lagos to begin formulating its report and </p><p>recommendations.  Danjuma was pleased a EUCOM EOD survey team </p><p>had been requested, and was interested in additional support. </p><p> The Ambassador made a request for disaster assistance  and </p><p>the immediate release of the USD25m from the Emergency Fund </p><p>(Abuja 301).  Embassy requests the inter-agency begin </p><p>consideration of additional support, to include provision of </p><p>OFR Phase III supplies remaining in Abuja.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ambassador, accompanied by Defense Attache, </p><p>Assistant Army Attache and PolMilOff, called on Minister of </p><p>Defense Danjuma on January 30 to offer condolences on the </p><p>loss of life in Lagos resulting from the explosion of the </p><p>Ikeja Ammunition Depot. (NOTE: On January 27, the Ikeja </p><p>Military Cantonment and Ammunition Depot exploded when large </p><p>quantities of stored  and aging ordinance accidentally </p><p>detonated.  The official death toll is now over 700, and more </p><p>bodies are still being recovered.  There was large-scale </p><p>destruction of property for several kilometers surrounding </p><p>the depot, which included residences, military barracks, </p><p>small businesses, and factories.  The explosions were felt </p><p>for more than 20 kilometers from ground zero. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Minister Danjuma thanked the Ambassador, noting that </p><p>he had conducted an on-the-ground assessment the day before. </p><p>It appeared that more people were killed than injured, and </p><p>the death toll certainly would be several thousand.  Danjuma </p><p>said most of those killed were children; moreover, </p><p>significant numbers of children were left parentless or </p><p>separated from parents as a result of the explosion and </p><p>ensuing chaos.  Many buildings had collapsed and the </p><p>reinforced windows in the international airport had been </p><p>blown out (the international airport, however, remains open). </p><p> Danjuma stated that over 400 bodies had been pulled from the </p><p>Ikeja canal, and the recovery effort continued.  Divers had </p><p>been deployed to carry out the effort.  Danjuma was concerned </p><p>the canal would become contaminated, endangering the water </p><p>supply.  Unexploded ordinance was the most immediate concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The scale of supporting those now homeless and </p><p>dispossessed would be significant, Danjuma stressed.  To </p><p>begin tackling this humanitarian challenge, the President had </p><p>announced a Disaster Relief Fund, managed by a committee </p><p>headed by the Secretary to the Government, Chief Ufot </p><p>Ekaette.  A Nigerian needs assessment was already ongoing and </p><p>would be completed next week.  At that time, Nigeria would </p><p>make specific requests to its friends in the donor community. </p><p> The President had also announced the GON had allocated Naira </p><p>200 million (about USD1.4m) for the relief effort, </p><p>supplemented by Naira 100 million (about USD875,000) from the </p><p>Nigerian National Petroleum Commission (NNPC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) DATT told the Minister that the Nigerian Army\'s </p><p>Chief of Operations, General Jinadu, had sent a letter to him </p><p>requesting explosive ordinance disposal support.  DATT stated </p><p>that in response, EUCOM planned to send a three-man EOD </p><p>survey team in the next few days to assess the situation and </p><p>decide the scope and magnitude of needs.  (NOTE: Danjuma </p><p>provided the DATT a twenty-page listing of ordinance stored </p><p>at the depot, which included large quantities of munitions -- </p><p>from small arms ammunition to large caliber artillery </p><p>projectiles and powder charges, as well as engineering </p><p>explosives.  This comprehensive list will be provided to the </p><p>EOD survey team. END NOTE.)  Danjuma said he would instruct </p><p>the Army to detail an officer to the team for the duration of </p><p>their stay, and would make sure the team had easy entry to </p><p>Nigeria.  Danjuma also noted that the British also had been </p><p>asked for EOD assistance.  DATT said he would coordinate our </p><p>efforts with his British counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Danjuma asked what support was available from the </p><p>United States.  The DATT responded that provision of U.S </p><p>military support would depend on Nigeria\'s assessment and </p><p>official requests, and the ability of the USG to provide </p><p>assistance considering other worldwide commitments and </p><p>funding.  The Minister asked if Nigeria could publish U.S. </p><p>assistance plans.  The Ambassador cautioned Danjuma to wait, </p><p>since we were uncertain of the kind and amount assistance </p><p>that might be made available.  We did not want to raise </p><p>expectations that could not be met.  Announcement of the </p><p>deployment of the EUCOM EOD survey team, however, could be </p><p>made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT: The disaster in Lagos resulted in </p><p>significant death and dislocation.  Thus, the Ambassador </p><p>formally declared a disaster (septel) on January 31, and </p><p>requested the immediate allocation of USD25,000 in emergency </p><p>assistance.  The most immediate concern is the prevention of </p><p>additional injuries and deaths from unexploded ordinance. </p><p>However, relief in the form of food, shelter and medical </p><p>supplies is also needed.  Lagos CG, PolOff and Assistant Army </p><p>Attache plan a site visit for 31 January, and will provide </p><p>additional details for assistance needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The GON simply does not have the infrastructure and </p><p>technical skills to manage a disaster of this scale.  We </p><p>believe they will need support in the areas of: explosive </p><p>ordnance disposal and technical assistance; mortuary affairs; </p><p>medical assistance; medical supplies; in-country clearance </p><p>and evacuation of casualties; ground transportation; </p><p>humanitarian assistance for refugees; logistic support to the </p><p>Nigerian authorities; diver support; and, water purification. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Embassy requests the Department, </p><p>working with sister agencies, begin to consider assistance of </p><p>the types mentioned above.  An immediate donation of the </p><p>post-Operation Focus Relief excess supplies and equipment now </p><p>being prepared for shipment to Sierra Leone (consisting </p><p>mostly of supplies remaining from the FOB) would be an </p><p>immediate and helpful gesture of support.  The materiel </p><p>includes: several containers of MRE rations; purified water; </p><p>about 30 large tents; camp support equipment such as </p><p>generators; six vehicles; concertina wire; office equipment; </p><p>kitchen and cooking equipment.  These supplies could be in </p><p>Lagos within days, and would be of immediate use in feeding </p><p>and sheltering people, transporting equipment, providing </p><p>electricity, and cordoning dangerous areas. END ACTION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
