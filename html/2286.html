PERHAPS A BIT SLOW OUT OF THE GATE, GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>   ZIMBABWE MEDIA AND INFORMATION RESOURCES ARE NOW FULLY </p><p>   ENGAGED IN CRITICISM OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>   ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT.  SOME OF THAT CRITICISM IS BASED </p><p>   ON DELIBERATE DISTORTION OF THE BILL.  GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>   ELECTRONIC MEDIA HAVE ALSO MANIPULATED REPORTING ON THE </p><p>   VISIT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY KANSTEINER IN ORDER TO </p><p>   PORTRAY THE BILL AND THE U.S. AS BULLYING ZIMBABWE.  TO </p><p>   ITS CREDIT, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY "THE </p><p>   HERALD" DID PUBLISH THE ENTIRE BILL AND ACCOMPANYING </p><p>   HIRC REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>2.   AMONG THE MEANS USED BY GOVERNMENT-OWNED MEDIA TO </p><p>   DISTORT ZDERA ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-    CONSISTENTLY CALLING IT THE "ZIMBABWE SANCTIONS </p><p>  BILL" RATHER THAN BY ITS CORRECT NAME. </p><p>-    COMPLETE LACK OF COVERAGE OF THE INCENTIVES ZDERA </p><p>  OFFERS. </p><p>-    AD HOMINEM ATTACKS AGAINST THE BILL\'S SPONSORS. </p><p>-    CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BILL AS "RACIST" </p><p>  LEGISLATION, FAILING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL ROLE </p><p>  THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS PLAYED IN ITS PASSAGE. </p><p>-    DELIBERATE MANIPULATION OF STATEMENTS BY ASSISTANT </p><p>  SECRETARY KANSTEINER TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE </p><p>  UNITED STATES DEMANDED THAT THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>  FORUM OBSERVE ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p>-    CITING CAPTIVE AND UNNAMED SOURCES FOR STATEMENTS </p><p>  THAT ZDERA WILL "STARVE" OR "STRANGLE" THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>  ZIMBABWE. </p><p>-    HIGHLIGHTING AND REPEATING COMMENTS BY MEMBERS OF </p><p>  THE SADC MINISTERIAL TEAM CURRENTLY IN HARARE THAT SADC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03687  01 OF 02  121358Z </p><p>  OPPOSES SANCTIONS. </p><p>-    UNCONFIRMED AND ALMOST CERTAINLY EXAGGERATED </p><p>  REPORTS OF ANTI-ZDERA DEMONSTRATIONS BY CITIZENS IN </p><p>  PROVINCIAL TOWNS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   IN ADDITION TO THE SORT OF "NEWS REPORTING" </p><p>   OUTLINED ABOVE, GOVERNMENT-OWNED PRINT MEDIA ARE ALSO </p><p>   INDULGING THEIR POLITICAL BOSSES WITH LENGTHY OPINION </p><p>   PIECES DENOUNCING ZDERA AND THE U.S. WE OFFER A FEW </p><p>   HIGHLIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   FROM THE DECEMBER 12 EDITION OF "THE HERALD," </p><p>   UNDER THE TITLE "ANTI-ZIM BILL DRACONIAN -- PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>   NATIONALIST AGENDA A THREAT TO U.S. INFLUENCE": </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .AFTER READING THE ZDERA SEVERAL TIMES, I HAVE </p><p>   COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE REAL OBJECTIVES OF </p><p>   THE BILL ARE REVEALED NOT BY ITS STATED INTENTIONS </p><p>   BUT BY ITS CONTRADICTIONS.  IN ITS OPENING </p><p>   PARAGRAPH, THE BILL SAYS ITS INTENTIONS ARE \'TO </p><p>   PROVIDE FOR A TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND TO </p><p>   PROMOTE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN ZIMBABWE.\'  REALLY! </p><p>   ARE WE NOW TO BELIEVE THAT AFTER HOLDING REGULAR </p><p>   ELECTIONS IN THE YEARS 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, </p><p>   1996, AND 2000, ZIMBABWE HAS SOMEHOW STOPPED BEING </p><p>   A DEMOCRACY?  AND IF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>   KEEN TO PROMOTE THE \'TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY,\' WHY </p><p>   HAS IT NOT DRAFTED AN APPROPRIATE BILL FOR SOMALIA, </p><p>   THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO AND THE SUDAN.? </p><p>   IT IS A MEASURE OF THE ARROGANCE OF THE PEOPLE THAT </p><p>   CRAFTED THIS BILL THAT THEY THINK ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03687  01 OF 02  121358Z </p><p>   SOVEREIGNTY CAN BE BOUGHT FOR A PALTRY US$26 </p><p>   MILLION! .PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WAS ULTIMATELY </p><p>   ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., NOT BY THE AMERICAN </p><p>   PEOPLE, BUT BY ONE VOTE, WHEN THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>   VOTED BY 5 TO 4 IN FAVOR OF PREVENTING A RECOUNT OF </p><p>   THE VOTES IN FLORIDA THAT MIGHT HAVE RETURNED AL </p><p>   GORE AS THE PRESIDENT.  THE AMERICANS MUST BE </p><p>   REMINDED THAT THEIR PATRONIZING AND PATERNALIST </p><p>   ATTITUDE TOWARDS ZIMBABWE IS SLOWLY ERODING THEIR </p><p>   INFLUENCE IN THIS COUNTRY.  THEY MUST BE REMINDED </p><p>   THAT IN 25 YEARS TIME, 40 PERCENT OF AMERICA\'S </p><p>   POPULATION WILL BE COMPOSED OF PEOPLE WITH A BLACK </p><p>   OR BROWN SKIN." </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE PASSING OF THE LEGISLATION </p><p>IS TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  CLEARLY THE WEST HAS A SINISTER POLITICAL </p><p>AGENDA.

WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT MORE OF THIS SORT OF </p><p>   REPORTING AND COMMENTARY LIES AHEAD. WE EXPECT, FOR </p><p>   EXAMPLE, THAT ZDERA WILL BE THE FOCUS OF CONSIDERABLE </p><p>   ATTENTION AND CRITICISM AT THE ZANU-PF NATIONAL </p><p>   CONFERENCE SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 13-15 IN VICTORIA </p><p>   FALLS. </p><p> </p><p>7.   THROUGH PRESS CONFERENCES, INTERVIEWS, </p><p>   DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION AND STEADY CONTACT WORK </p><p>   WITH EDITORS AND REPORTERS, WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE </p><p>   CAN TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE ACCESS </p><p>   TO ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT U.S. POLICY.  OUR </p><p>   UNWILLINGNESS TO LIE AND OUR LACK OF ACCESS TO THE </p><p>   ELECTRONIC MEDIA IN ZIMBABWE JUST MAKE THE CHALLENGE OF </p><p>   GETTING OUT OUR STORY ALL THAT MUCH MORE INTERESTING. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03687  02 OF 02  121358Z </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
