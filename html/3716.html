American citizen Griffin Shea, senior reporter </p><p>    for the Agence France Presse (AFP) bureau in Harare, </p><p>    is expected to leave Zimbabwe on Saturday, September </p><p>    14, following the Government of Zimbabwe\'s refusal to </p><p>    renew his work permit.  Shea, who has been working in </p><p>    Zimbabwe since 2000, was ordered to leave the country </p><p>    by the Ministry of Information at the expiry of his </p><p>    contract this week.  According to government-owned </p><p>    media reports Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has </p><p>    dismissed calls for the renewal of Shea\'s work permit, </p><p>    saying that no foreign journalists will be allowed to </p><p>    hold a permanent work permit in Zimbabwe.  "We are not </p><p>    a banana republic wanting to please foreign </p><p>    journalists. . .  We are very proud that we are one of </p><p>    the countries who have trained an impressive </p><p>    professional cadre of journalists and they need work. </p><p>    Shea is an American and he can go and work there," </p><p>    Moyo is quoted as saying. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
