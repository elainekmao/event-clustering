THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED ONE OF THE MAJOR SUCCESSES OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02557  01 OF 02  220907Z </p><p>VISIT WAS THE IMAGE OF VIETNAM WHICH WAS TRANSMITTED </p><p>BACK TO THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD.  NO LONGER, HE </p><p>SAID, COULD PEOPLE PRETEND VIETNAM WAS STILL THE WAY </p><p>THEY HAD SEEN IT IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AND </p><p>EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THEM.  VIETNAM\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ASEAN AND THE REST OF THE WORLD HAD BEEN </p><p>ENHANCED BECAUSE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ALSO WERE ABLE </p><p>TO SEE VIETNAM AND THE U.S. HAD DEVELOPED A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WHICH MATCHED THEIR OWN AND THAT VIETNAM </p><p>WAS NOW IN THE SAME BALLPARK WITH MOST OF ITS ASEAN </p><p>NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR SAID U.S. POLICY TOWARD VIETNAM </p><p>HAD BEEN GIVEN A NEW DIRECTION BY THE VISIT AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY NOTED THE PRESIDENT\'S COMMITMENT OF THE </p><p>U.S. TO WORK WITH VIETNAM ON ITS REFORM AND OPENING </p><p>POLICY.  HE NOTED THE U.S. WOULD MAKE ITS SUGGESTIONS, </p><p>BUT THE PACE AND DECISIONS WOULD ALL BE ONES MADE BY </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP.  THE U.S., HE SAID, WOULD </p><p>NOT BE "FORCING" ANY STEPS OR ACTIONS ON THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WHICH THEY WERE NOT PREPARED TO TAKE ON THEIR OWN. </p><p>CONTRASTING HIS OWN READING OF U.S. HISTORY WITH THAT </p><p>OF PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DECLARED THE U.S. HAS NEVER HAD "IMPERIALIST" DESIGNS </p><p>ON OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR DETAILED A NUMBER OF EVENTS -- </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE WELCOMING CEREMONY, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL BANQUET AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND THE FAREWELL </p><p>CALL, AS WELL AS THE MEETINGS -- WHICH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND MRS.

HE PRAISED THE MEETING WITH PM KHAI FOR ITS </p><p>FOCUS ON WAYS IN WHICH TO BUILD THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND TO MOVE ECONOMIC ISSUES AND THE BTA </p><p>INTO GREATER FUTURE FOCUS.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU HAD MISSED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO THAT IMAGE OF PROGRESS BY </p><p>FOCUSING ON AN IDEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF RELATIONS </p><p>WHICH SUGGESTED HE MIGHT BE PUSHING AWAY THE HAND OF </p><p>FRIENDSHIP WHICH WAS BEING OFFERED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE HAD HEARD LOCAL </p><p>VIETNAMESE ALSO EXPRESSING SOME DISSATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THIS IMAGE OF PHIEU BASED ON ITS PORTRAYAL IN THE LOCAL </p><p>PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE VIETNAMESE TO </p><p>PROVIDE US WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THE TWO INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WHO HAD BEEN PICKED UP SWIMMING NEAR THE CONTAINER PORT </p><p>WHICH RESULTED IN THE VIETNAMESE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES </p><p>DECISION TO MOVE THE APL CONTAINER VESSEL THERE.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED HIS PERSONAL CONCERN ABOUT THE ROLE OF LY </p><p>TONG IN DUMPING LEAFLETS OVER THE CITY AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S VISIT WAS BEGINNING.  HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THE THAI GOVERNMENT HAD ARRESTED HIM FOR HIJACKING AND </p><p>THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME DISCUSSION OF HIS BEING </p><p>PROSECUTED IN THE U.S. AS WELL.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>THE U.S. HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER AND CONDEMNED </p><p>HIJACKING AS A "DANGEROUS ACT" WHICH SHOULD NOT GO </p><p>UNPUNISHED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02557  01 OF 02  220907Z </p><p>5.

HE PARTICULARLY COMMENDED PROTOCOL </p><p>DIRECTOR LUU FOR HIS GOOD WORK.  HE SAID THE PRESIDENT </p><p>DEPARTED VIETNAM WITH A VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE </p><p>FEELING ABOUT VIETNAM AND ITS PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLE HAD </p><p>REACTED WITH A GENUINE SHOW OF ENTHUSIASM AND AFFECTION </p><p>WHICH DEEPLY TOUCHED ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. </p><p>TEAM.  HE THEN SUGGESTED BIN AND HIS STAFF MEET WITH </p><p>HIM AND EMBASSY PERSONNEL IN THE COMING WEEKS TO TAKE A </p><p>LOOK AT NEXT STEPS TO BUILD THE RELATIONSHIP AND TO </p><p>BETTER DELINEATE VIETNAMESE PRIORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) VICE MINISTER BIN THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR </p><p>HIS WORDS OF PRAISE AND FOR HIS FRANK ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>VISIT, SAYING HE TOO SHARED MANY OF THESE CONCLUSIONS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THAT THE OVERALL VISIT WAS A BIG SUCCESS. </p><p>IN STOCK FORMULATION, BIN SAID THE VISIT WAS GOOD </p><p>BECAUSE IT ENHANCED MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE </p><p>COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES AND THAT IT PROVIDED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH SIDES TO PLEDGE THEIR COOPERATION </p><p>ON HEALING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR.  CHIDING THE </p><p>U.S. SIDE BECAUSE OF ITS EFFORTS TO CUT OUT THE </p><p>FAREWELL AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AND TO SIGN </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE VISIT, BIN SAID </p><p>"I TOLD YOU WE COULD PROVIDE GOOD CEREMONIES.  IT WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE TWO PRESIDENTS TO WITNESS THE </p><p>SIGNINGS AND FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THE OFFICIAL FAREWELL." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02557  02 OF 02  220907Z </p><p> </p><p>7.

HE WELCOMED THE U.S. </p><p>INITIATIVE ON THE ECONOMIC DIALOGUE BUT URGED THE U.S. </p><p>NOW TO "PROVIDE INSIGHT" INTO THE PROCESS SO VIETNAM </p><p>MIGHT DESIGNATE THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY CONTACT PERSONS </p><p>TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE.  HE SAID HE HOPED THE NEW S&T </p><p>AGREEMENT WOULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR FURTHER DEEPENING </p><p>OF SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND SAID HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE </p><p>ON DIOXINS IN SINGAPORE NEXT WEEK WOULD HAVE GOOD </p><p>RESULTS.  HE REINFORCED VIETNAMESE COMMITMENT TO </p><p>HEALING THE WOUNDS OF WAR THROUGH MIA ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>U.S. AND THANKED THE U.S. FOR ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES </p><p>IN ITS PRESENTATIONS DURING THE VISIT.  BIN PRAISED THE </p><p>U.S. CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMINING ACTIVITIES AND TO </p><p>PLEDGES REGARDING DETOXIFICATION OF SITES.  HE URGED </p><p>THE U.S. TO CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME "APPROPRIATE FORMS </p><p>OF ASSISTANCE" FOR VIETNAM, "WHILE WE ARE DOING THE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON AGENT ORANGE."  ACCORDING TO </p><p>BIN, PRESIDENT LUONG WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE THE U.S. HAD PROVIDED TO HELP VIETNAM TO </p><p>COPE WITH NATURAL DISASTERS AND WAS PLEASED BY THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WARNING SYSTEM ASSISTANCE.  HE </p><p>REVEALED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>ON A MEETING IN 2001 ON SAFETY FOR CHILDREN.  (NOTE: </p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST FORMAL INDICATION THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER HAS TAKEN THIS ISSUE TO HEART AND HAS </p><p>MADE IT A NATIONAL COMMITMENT.

HE NOTED EACH PERSON HAD HIS OWN "STYLE AND </p><p>MANNER" AND NOTED THAT PHIEU SPOKE VERY FRANKLY TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IN THEIR MEETING.  TRYING TO GIVE THE MEETING </p><p>CONTENT A MORE POSITIVE SPIN, BIN REMARKED THAT PHIEU </p><p>HAD INVITED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY TO RETURN TO </p><p>VIETNAM ONCE HE WAS NO LONGER IN OFFICE.  HE AGAIN </p><p>THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS ASSESSMENT AND FOR HIS </p><p>PRAISE OF THE MFA TEAM AND THOSE OF OTHER COLLEAGUES. </p><p>HE EXTENDED SIMILAR PRAISE TO THE EMBASSY, CONGEN, AND </p><p>WASHINGTON PERSONNEL WHO HAD HELPED TO MAKE THE VISIT </p><p>AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENT FOR BOTH SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>9.
