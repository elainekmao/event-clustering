<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003691 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, CY, GR </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON STROVILIA DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 152362 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) We presented reftel demarche to Ethem Barkan Oz, </p><p>first secretary in Cyprus Directorate General, who undertook </p><p>to convey USG concerns to Cyprus DG Ertugrul Apakan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Implying that he did not understand why the USG was </p><p>making the demarche, Oz denied vehemently that Turkish </p><p>Cypriots are breaking any pre-existing agreement with the UN </p><p>or Cypriot government.  Oz explained that the Turkish </p><p>Cypriots had only occupied the single -- and abandoned, he </p><p>claimed -- home in Strovilia to help facilitate the flow of </p><p>people between the two sides.  Further, Oz argued that unless </p><p>the Turkish Cypriots remain in the house, they will not be </p><p>able to keep the gate open.  By lodging complaints with </p><p>UNFICYP about Strovilia, Oz asserted, the Greek Cypriots are </p><p>spoiling the current positive atmosphere on the island. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
