SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR PRESENTED REF A DEMARCHE TO </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAHLOUL MORNING NOVEMBER 26.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER GRAVELY ACKNOWLEDGED SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>GOS AVOWED POSITION OF NEUTRALITY IN GULF CONFLICT AND </p><p>ITS RELATIONS WITH USG AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF ANY </p><p>SHARING WITH IRAQ OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION OBTAINED </p><p>FROM THE SAUDI FIGHTER PILOT DEFECTOR.  HE AGREED </p><p>PROMPTLY TO CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS </p><p>OF THE GOS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED BY ECON COUNSELLOR CALLED ON </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER ALI SAHLOUL MORNING NOVEMBER 26 TO </p><p>PRESENT DEMARCHE AS INSTRUCTED REF A.  ALSO PRESENT ON </p><p>GOS SIDE WERE DIRECTOR TWO AMERICAS DEPARTMENT, AMB. </p><p>OMAR ABDEL MAGID, AND HIS DEPUTY KAMAL AHMED FADUL </p><p>(NOTETAKER). </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY RECALLING HIS AUGUST 28 MEETING </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT AL BASHIR DURING WHICH HE HAD WARNED THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AGAINST ANY GOS ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR IRAQ AND </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF UNSC RESOLUTIONS ON THE GULF CONFLICT. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT HAD ASSURED HIM AT THAT TIME </p><p>THAT GOS HAD NOT AND WOULD NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT IRAQ </p><p>AND THAT IT WOULD RESPECT UNSC RESOLUTIONS ON THE </p><p>GULF.  SINCE THEN THERE HAD BEEN SOME INDICATIONS OF </p><p>POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS ON UNSC RESOLUTIONS RELATED TO </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO IRAQUI SHIPS IN PORT SUDAN WHICH WE HAD </p><p>BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOS.  GIVEN THIS </p><p>BACKGROUND WE WERE NOW SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT IRAQ COULD GATHER INTELLIGENCE FROM </p><p>THE SAUDI FIGHTER  PILOT WHO DEFECTED TO SUDAN RECENTLY </p><p>AND REMAINED IN GOS CUSTODY.  THIS CONCERN HAD </p><p>INCREASED IN RECENT DAYS AS A RESULT OF INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT THE GOS MIGHT ALLOW THE IRAQUIS TO EXPLOIT THE </p><p>SAUDI PILOT FOR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE AMBASSADOR THEN SLOWLY READ TO THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER THE FULL TEXT OF THE TALKING  POINTS IN PARA 2 </p><p>OF REF A AND GAVE HIM A NON-PAPER WHICH CONTAINED </p><p>THEM.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER GRAVELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS A MOST SERIOUS MATTER WHICH HE APPRECIATED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR PROMPTLY BRINGING TO HIS ATTENTION.  HE </p><p>AGREED WITH THE POINT THAT SUCH ACTION BY THE GOS WOULD </p><p>DESTROY ITS CLAIM TO NEUTRALITY BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES </p><p>IN THE GULF CONFLICT AND UNDERMINE ITS EFFORTS TO BRING </p><p>ABOUT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION WITHIN THE ARAB FAMILY.  HE </p><p>ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH ACTION </p><p>FOR GOS RELATIONS WITH THE USG AND OTHER ALLIED </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE </p><p>TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE GOS.  AMBASSDOR URGED HIM </p><p>TO DO SO QUICKLY GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE ISSUE AND THE </p><p>POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR SUDAN.  AS AMBASSADOR OMAR </p><p>ABDEL MAGID ESCORTED AMBASSADOR TO HIS CAR HE CONFIDED </p><p>THAT THIS WAS THE MOST SERIOUS MEETING HE HAD ATTENDED </p><p>DURING HIS TENURE IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>AGREED THAT IT WAS INDEED SERIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: I DOUBT THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS IN THE </p><p>LOOP ON GOS HANDLING OF THE DEFECTED SAUDI FIGHTER </p><p>PILOT.  HE NOW IS AND I BELIEVE HE WILL DO AS HE SAID </p><p>AND CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE TO THE PRESIDENT.  IT MAY WELL </p><p>BE TOO LATE TO DETER THE GOS (REF B).  NEVERTHELESS, AS </p><p>I NOTED REF C, WE HAVE AT LEAST PUT THE GOS ON NOTICE </p><p>AND LAID DOWN A MARKER SHOULD A MORE SEVERE RESPONSE BE </p><p>REQUIRED LATER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  POSTSCRIPT:  AFTER DRAFTING ABOVE, AMBASSADOR OMAR </p><p>MAGID TELEPHONED TO INFORM ME THAT FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SAHLOUL HAD SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT OUR DEMARCHE </p><p>THIS MORNING AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER WISHED TO SEE ME </p><p>TOMORROW (NOVEMBER 27) AT 0845. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
