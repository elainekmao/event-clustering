REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) MP DAVID </p><p>COLTART TOLD POLOFFS ON JANUARY 24 THAT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND </p><p>MARCH 31, 2002, AND SAID ANY ATTEMPT TO CALL AN EARLIER </p><p>ELECTION WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>MDC HAS THE SUPPORT TO WIN AN ELECTION THAT IS EVEN CLOSE </p><p>TO FREE AND FAIR, AND SAID THE PARTY WOULD FOCUS ON </p><p>REGISTERING THE 600,000 ZIMBABWEANS EXPECTED TO TURN 18 </p><p>BETWEEN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION AND THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL POLL. ACCORDING TO COLTART, A COORDINATED </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT MUGABE BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- PARTICULARLY COMMONWEALTH </p><p>NATIONS -- IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING RESTORATION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND A FREE AND FAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>COLTART EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT INCREASING </p><p>HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, AND </p><p>ASKED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DO WHAT IT CAN TO </p><p>BOLSTER THE JUDICIARY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00507  01 OF 03  250536Z </p><p> </p><p>2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A JANUARY 24 DISCUSSION OF RECENT POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS WITH POLOFFS, MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND </p><p>SECRETARY FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS -- AND PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>LAWYER -- DAVID COLTART NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION MUST BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31, 2002. </p><p>ACCORDING TO COLTART, THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BE HELD WITHIN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>EXPIRATION OF THE INCUMBENT\'S TERM, AND PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>CURRENT TERM EXPIRES ON APRIL 1, 2002.  HE DISMISSED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT ZANU-PF COULD CALL A SNAP ELECTION LATER </p><p>THIS YEAR IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH THE MDC OFF-GUARD, SAYING </p><p>SUCH A MOVE WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE ONLY WAY AN </p><p>ELECTION COULD BE HELD EARLIER THAN THE SPECIFIED 90-DAY </p><p>PERIOD, COLTART SAID, WOULD BE IN THE EVENT MUGABE </p><p>RESIGNED, DIED, OR WAS INCAPACITATED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COLTART INSISTED THAT ZIMBABWEAN DEMOGRAPHICS FAVOR </p><p>THE MDC IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ZANU-PF, HE </p><p>POINTED OUT, WON 200,000 FEWER VOTES THAN THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND WOULD BE </p><p>UNLIKELY, FOR TWO REASONS, TO PRESERVE EVEN THAT MARGIN IN </p><p>2002.  FIRST, COLTART CONTENDED, ZANU-PF RECEIVED AS MANY </p><p>VOTES AS IT DID BECAUSE MANY OF THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES WERE POPULAR IN THEIR LOCAL </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  MUGABE, THOUGH, WOULD NOT RECEIVE AS MANY </p><p>VOTES NATIONWIDE AS HIS PARTY DID, BECAUSE HE IS DEEPLY </p><p>UNPOPULAR.  SECOND, COLTART NOTED, SOME 600,000 ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00507  01 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO TURN 18 -- AND THUS BECOME ELIGIBLE TO VOTE </p><p>-- BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL NEW VOTERS LIVE IN URBAN AREAS AND </p><p>ARE COMPLETELY DISILLUSIONED WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>ZANU-PF.   ONE OF THE MDC\'S KEY ELECTORAL STRATEGIES, </p><p>THEREFORE, IS TO REGISTER AS MANY OF THESE 18-YEAR-OLDS AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  COLTART ASKED FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE IN ENSURING A </p><p>FAIR, TRANSPARENT REGISTRATION PROCESS, NOTING THAT THE GOZ </p><p>HAS IN THE PAST ERECTED OBSTACLES TO THE REGISTRATION OF </p><p>VOTERS SUSPECTED OF SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF IN END GAME STRATEGY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COLTART SAID THE RECENT PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTIONS </p><p>IN MARONDERA AND BIKITA HAD CONFIRMED THAT ZANU-PF IS </p><p>DETERMINED TO EMPLOY ANY MEANS TO HOLD ON TO POWER.  THE </p><p>MDC, HOWEVER, DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY OR INCLINATION TO </p><p>COUNTER THE TERROR CAMPAIGNS THAT THE RULING PARTY IS </p><p>CLEARLY PREPARED TO ORCHESTRATE IN OTHER BY-ELECTIONS. </p><p>COLTART, THEREFORE, IS ADVISING THE MDC LEADERSHIP NOT TO </p><p>BE AS STRIDENT IN PURSUING ITS CHALLENGES TO ZANU\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL VICTORIES IN 38 CONSTITUENCIES IN LAST JUNE\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  IF THESE CHALLENGES ARE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL AND RESULT IN THE HOLDING OF BY-ELECTIONS, THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5163 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00507  02 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------BB41C9  250536Z /38 </p><p>P 250534Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8077 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WELLINGTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ACCRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00507  02 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/24/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MDC MP URGES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO GET TOUGH </p><p>WITH MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR THEM TO BE CONDUCTED IN </p><p>TRANCHES, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALLY, AS THIS WOULD POSE A </p><p>LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE FOR ZANU-PF AND ITS TACTICS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  (NOTE:  COLTART MENTIONED THAT </p><p>ANOTHER BY-ELECTION MAY SOON BE IN THE OFFING BECAUSE THE </p><p>ZANU-PF MP FOR MWENEZI DISTRICT, ISAIAH SHUMBA, IS "ON HIS </p><p>DEATH BED."  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>CRUCIAL ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COLTART STRESSED THAT A COORDINATED CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT MUGABE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>-- PARTICULARLY COMMONWEALTH NATIONS WHICH HAVE </p><p>HISTORICALLY ENJOYED GOOD RELATIONS WITH ZIMBABWE -- IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL TO BRINGING ABOUT A RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW AND ENSURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT IS FREE AND </p><p>FAIR.  COLTART MENTIONED INDIA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NEW </p><p>ZEALAND, GHANA, BOTSWANA, AND NIGERIA AS NATIONS THAT COULD </p><p>PLAY A PARTICULARLY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE.  HE THOUGHT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES COULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE BEHIND THE SCENES IN </p><p>PRESSING OUR FRIENDS IN THE COMMONWEALTH TO DELIVER A VERY </p><p>TOUGH MESSAGE TO MUGABE.  THE ESSENCE OF THAT MESSAGE, </p><p>COLTART URGED, SHOULD BE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00507  02 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>WILL NOT TOLERATE THE GOZ\'S CONTINUED ABUSE OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW AND THAT, IF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO VIOLATE THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS OF HIS CITIZENS IN AN EFFORT TO REMAIN IN </p><p>POWER, HE CAN EXPECT TO FACE SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES.  SUCH </p><p>CONSEQUENCES, COLTART EXPLAINED, MIGHT INCLUDE A BAN ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL BY MUGABE AND HIS CRONIES AND/OR A </p><p>COORDINATED INVESTIGATION OF THE AMOUNT AND LOCATION OF </p><p>THEIR ASSETS.  THE THREAT OF HAVING HIS ASSETS SEIZED, </p><p>COLTART BELIEVED, WOULD FORCE MUGABE TO REVERSE HIS MORE </p><p>OBJECTIONABLE AND DAMAGING POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  POLOFF ASKED WHO SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY TARGETS OF </p><p>A TRAVEL BAN OR INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATION.  COLTART </p><p>REPLIED THAT, LAST NOVEMBER, HE HAD SHARED WITH FORMER AF </p><p>DAS WITNEY SCHNEIDMAN AND AF/S A PAPER IMPLICATING ELEVEN </p><p>SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, IN </p><p>SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>MATABELELAND MASSACRES IN THE 1980S AND WITH THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF VIOLENCE WHICH PRECEDED THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>JUDICIARY NEEDS HELP </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COLTART EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE SUPREME COURT, </p><p>AND CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY IN PARTICULAR, HAS COME UNDER </p><p>IMMENSE PRESSURE FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, RANGING FROM </p><p>THE NOVEMBER INVASION OF THE COURT BY WAR VETERANS AND </p><p>RENT-A-THUGS TO REPEATED PUBLIC CRITICISMS BY SENIOR GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS.  COLTART SAID HE HAS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOZ WANTS </p><p>TO TRY TO FORCE GUBBAY TO RETIRE BEFORE HE REACHES HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00507  02 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE IN APRIL 2002 AND TO REPLACE HIM </p><p>WITH THE PLIABLE PRO-ZANU JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH </p><p>COURT, GODFREY CHIDIYAUSIKU.  GUBBAY, COLTART CLAIMED, IS </p><p>FEELING INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND MIGHT SOON SUCCUMB TO THE </p><p>PRESSURE TO RESIGN.  COLTART MADE A STRONG PLEA FOR THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND OTHERS TO DEMONSTRATE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE JUDICIARY AND ITS INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WE SHARE COLTART\'S ANALYSIS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY CANNOT WIN AN ELECTION THAT APPROACHES </p><p>FREE AND FAIR AND WILL USE ALL THE RESOURCES AT HIS </p><p>DISPOSAL TO STAY IN POWER.  THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE GUBBAY -- AND HIS REPLACEMENT WITH GODFREY </p><p>CHIDIYAUSIKU -- WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW, EFFECTIVELY NEUTRALIZING THE ONE REMAINING BRANCH OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT THAT PROVIDES A CHECK ON MUGABE\'S POWERS.  WE </p><p>ARE BEGINNING TO REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT ONLY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>AND COORDINATED EXTERNAL PRESSURE IMPOSED VIA THE KIND OF </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN COLTART SUGGESTS, WITH TOUGH STICKS, IS </p><p>LIKELY TO FORCE MUGABE TO STEP BACK FROM HIS PRESENT </p><p>DISASTROUS COURSE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5164 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00507  03 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------BB41CC  250536Z /38 </p><p>P 250534Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8078 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WELLINGTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ACCRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00507  03 OF 03  250536Z </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/24/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MDC MP URGES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO GET TOUGH </p><p>WITH MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
