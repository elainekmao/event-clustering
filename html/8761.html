<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001223 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, KPAO, OIIP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DROC; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Uganda must be condemned" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its June 15 editorial to accusing Uganda of throwing </p><p>      spanners into the peace process in the Democratic </p><p>      Republic of Congo (DRC).  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The United Nations, in particular, and the </p><p>      international community in general, need to move </p><p>      fast in adopting a firmer stance against Kampala and </p><p>      Yoweri Museveni over the continued crisis in the </p><p>      DRC.  Evidence available points to the fact that </p><p>      Uganda is deliberately sustaining the perpetuation </p><p>      of rebel-led war in the DRC. . .That Uganda was part </p><p>      of the process that led to the war in DRC in the </p><p>      late 1990s is an indictment enough.  Continuing with </p><p>      such perverted activities should be condemned in the </p><p>      strongest terms.  What is particularly irking is </p><p>      that the U. S. administration keeps praising </p><p>      Museveni as an African role model, despite the </p><p>      gruesome revelations.  The U. N. should also move </p><p>      away from its tendency to just criticize, and take </p><p>      more concrete action." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
