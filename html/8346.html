<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003506 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, MARR, AR, TU, IZ, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: DAS PASCOE\'S MAY 21-22 POST-WAR TOUR D\'HORIZON </p><p>WITH GOT OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 3412 B) ANKARA 3318 C) ANKARA 3409 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) State Department DAS for European Affairs Lynn Pascoe </p><p>told GOT officials May 21-22 the USG was disappointed with </p><p>Turkey over its handling of issues of major importance to the </p><p>US, including Iraq and Cyprus.  DAS Pascoe said the door to </p><p>rebuilding relations was open, but it was up to Turkey to </p><p>walk through.  Only concrete actions would help rebuild the </p><p>relationship.  After arguing that &disappointment8 was a </p><p>two-way street, GOT officials went out of their way to try to </p><p>convince Pascoe that Turkey was interested in rebuilding </p><p>relations.  However, they offered little in the way of </p><p>concrete steps the GOT was willing to take at this time.  GOT </p><p>officials said Turkey wanted to improve relations with </p><p>Armenia but argued that Yerevan had to take the lead before </p><p>Ankara would reciprocate.  Turkey was committed to enacting </p><p>EU-related reforms, but GOT officials expressed doubts about </p><p>the EU,s intentions.  The MFA pressed for resumption of </p><p>formal bilateral discussions on the economic relationship and </p><p>noted the negative impact of the operation in Iraq on the </p><p>Turkish economy was less than forecast.  Turks are </p><p>discouraged by the recent inconclusive debates in Brussels </p><p>regarding NATO,s role in Iraq, but not yet alarmed at the </p><p>EU,s discussions on future European defense structures.  GOT </p><p>officials were disappointed that Turkey was included as a </p><p>Tier III country in the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report </p><p>and argued that Turkey should be removed from the list.  DAS </p><p>Pascoe,s discussions on Cyprus (ref a) and his meeting with </p><p>MFA U/S Ziyal (septel) are reported separately.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>VIEW FROM WASHINGTON </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During his May 21-22 meetings in Ankara, EUR DAS </p><p>Pascoe reminded GOT officials that Washington remained </p><p>disappointed with Turkey over its handling of issues of major </p><p>importance to the US.  The expectations in Washington </p><p>following the November 2002 elections had been high.  The USG </p><p>"went all out" to address Ankara,s concerns in Iraq and to </p><p>support Turkey on EU accession.  There was a clear assumption </p><p>in Washington, based on our relationship and the signals we </p><p>were getting from GOT officials in the months leading up to </p><p>the March 1 vote on Iraq, that Turkey would be there for us. </p><p>DAS Pascoe noted the failure to reach an agreement on Cyprus </p><p>was another huge shock and disappointment, almost on the same </p><p>scale as Iraq.  The USG had worked hard with all of the </p><p>parties to make sure Turkish concerns were addressed in the </p><p>Annan plan.  At some point, the parties need to look beyond </p><p>the interests of one or two individuals and do what is right </p><p>for the Cypriot people and the interests of the region.  DAS </p><p>Pascoe added that the US had demonstrated its intention to </p><p>maintain the bilateral relationship via Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>visit, the President\'s decision to include $1 billion in </p><p>assistance for Turkey in the supplemental, and in the call </p><p>between President Bush and Prime Minister Erdogan.  Pascoe </p><p>said the door to rebuilding relations was open, but it was up </p><p>to Turkey to take the necessary steps.  Only concrete </p><p>actions, including on Cyprus, Iraq, the Middle East, opening </p><p>the Armenian border, and economic reform, would help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>GOT REACTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Minister of Finance Unakitan summed up the views </p><p>expressed by GOT officials:  the GOT had been disappointed by </p><p>the outcome of the March 1 Parliamentary vote, and the key </p><p>figures (including PM Erdogan and FM Gul) shared a strong </p><p>desire to strengthen the bilateral relationship.  Unakitan </p><p>said he had recently discussed with FM Gul steps Turkey could </p><p>take to improve the relationship and had shared those ideas </p><p>with the Ambassador (ref b).  Presidential Foreign Policy </p><p>Advisor Atacanli also expressed disappointment.  He said it </p><p>was important for Washington to look at matters from the </p><p>Turkish perspective and asked for more &empathy8 in the </p><p>future.  Ankara had witnessed &colder winds from that side </p><p>of the Atlantic8 following the March 1 vote.  He expressed </p><p>hope that this and other visits would "warm the climate," </p><p>saying "I hope Turkey and the US can put the whole thing </p><p>behind us and look to the future.8  MFA DG for the Americas </p><p>Banguoglu said the US appeared &ungrateful8 for the support </p><p>Turkey had provided in the operation against Iraq.  He said </p><p>that the USG approach of "anything less than 100 percent </p><p>compliance is not enough8 was wrong.  &If one were to </p><p>examine Turkey,s support for US policy against Iraq since </p><p>the first Gulf War, you would conclude that Turkey ranks very </p><p>high, possibly higher than the UK.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ARMENIA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GOT officials were largely defensive about improving </p><p>relations between Turkey and Armenia:  the GOT had been </p><p>forthcoming with Yerevan and was prepared to reciprocate, but </p><p>the ball was in Yerevan\'s court.  Atacanli said the GOA </p><p>needed to change its frame of mind and begin to look at </p><p>Turkey in a &more cool-headed manner8 if it wanted to </p><p>improve relations.  MFA DG for the Caucasus Akinci noted that </p><p>Turkey and Armenia were carrying on very discreet DDG-level </p><p>talks -- with the next round scheduled for Istanbul at the </p><p>end of May -- to get bilateral relations moving.  Akinci </p><p>argued that Yerevan needed to make a distinction between </p><p>"state-to-state" and "nation-to-nation" relations.  The </p><p>latter, mired in historical debates about the fate of </p><p>Armenians at the end of the Ottoman era and exacerbated by </p><p>the Armenian Diaspora, inhibit progress on the bilateral </p><p>front.   As a prerequisite for improved Turkey-Armenia ties, </p><p>Yerevan must recognize the current Turkey-Armenia border and </p><p>give up claims to Turkish territory.  He added that there was </p><p>also the issue of Ankara\'s support for Baku over </p><p>Nagorno-Karabakh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MFA DDG for European Affairs Yenel said that GOT-EU </p><p>relations had improved since the December 2002 Copenhagen </p><p>Summit.  The Greeks have been &extremely supportive8 of </p><p>Turkey during their presidency.  Yenel said the GOT is </p><p>committed to EU-related reform.  The current one-party </p><p>government is in a better position to pass reform legislation </p><p>than the previous government.  That said, he acknowledged </p><p>that some of the reform legislation adopted by Parliament had </p><p>not been implemented, arguing that some elements of the </p><p>Turkish bureaucracy &do not believe in the EU8 and are </p><p>resisting reforms.  Yenel insisted the GOT has &caught a </p><p>good wind8 and will make the reforms necessary to meet EU </p><p>membership criteria.  He said the only obstacle he fears is </p><p>Cyprus:  &What will happen if the GOT makes all the </p><p>necessary reforms and doesn\'t solve Cyprus?8  All the other </p><p>candidates were required only to meet membership criteria, he </p><p>averred.  If Turkey is kept out of the EU because of Cyprus, </p><p>there will be a strong public reaction against the EU. </p><p>Presidential Advisor Atacanli said the GOT was prepared to do </p><p>its part to gain admission to the EU, but it would need &an </p><p>extra nudge8 from the US to secure support from the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Finance Minister Unakitan said severe pre-war anxiety </p><p>had given way to cautious post-war optimism, as oil prices </p><p>fell, tourism began to pick up, interest rates declined and </p><p>expectations improved.  He said the announcement of the $1B </p><p>U.S. assistance package to Turkey had provided a large </p><p>psychological boost as well.  Unakitan said the GOT was </p><p>working with the IMF to implement the reform program, and PM </p><p>Erdogan,s views on this do not diverge from those of the </p><p>Fund.  Unakitan said he is sticking to tight fiscal policy, </p><p>which means having to say "no" to many requests from other </p><p>ministers.  In a separate meeting, MFA DG for Bilateral </p><p>Economic Affairs Ozuye said there were signs that Turkey\'s </p><p>economy was improving.  After arguing (unsuccessfully) that </p><p>that the US textile quota was hurting Turkey, Ozuye asked </p><p>that the US and Turkey resume the three bilateral meetings </p><p>(the Economic Policy Commission, the Joint Economic </p><p>Commission and TIFA) to provide a forum to discuss issues of </p><p>mutual concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>NATO </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) MFA DDG for NATO Affairs Kizildeli said Turkey was </p><p>currently confused and discouraged by the recent debates at </p><p>NATO.  The GOT found Germany\'s dwelling on the question of a </p><p>NATO footprint in Iraq during debates on assistance to Poland </p><p>particularly discouraging.  Since Prague, the Turks have seen </p><p>little progress on capabilities.  She lamented that France </p><p>would not allow discussion of the use of the NATO Response </p><p>Force in the DPC; if it could only be discussed in the NAC, </p><p>it was virtually "unusable."  While it was somewhat </p><p>encouraging that NATO had gradually been allowed to </p><p>participate in ISAF in Afghanistan, Kizildeli said "France </p><p>allowing NATO to take part after everyone else had lost </p><p>interest was no way to keep NATO responsive and viable." </p><p>Kizildeli argued that Turkey was not looking at NATO as a </p><p>"back door" to participating in the stabilization force in </p><p>Iraq.  Iraq was very important to Turkey, and the GOT did not </p><p>want its stability left in the hands of "Honduras and the </p><p>Philippines" when everyone else lost interest.  Kizildeli </p><p>said Turkey was watching European defense structures develop </p><p>with great interest but was not yet alarmed.  The Europeans </p><p>don\'t yet have a "strategic vision," so Turkey is not yet </p><p>worried.  As an EU aspirant, Turkey was participating in </p><p>discussions on ESDP to the extent allowed and hoped to one </p><p>day fully benefit from European strategic cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>TRAFFICKING REPORT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Americas DG Banguoglu said that the GOT was </p><p>disappointed that Turkey was included as a Tier III country </p><p>in the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Using many of </p><p>the same points the Minister of Interior used with the </p><p>Ambassador later that same day (ref c), Banguoglu argued that </p><p>Turkey should be removed from the list altogether. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) DAS Pascoe has cleared this message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
