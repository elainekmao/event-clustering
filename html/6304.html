<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000686 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPP/MTA ROBERT DOWNES </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR DAVID SHARK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECIN, AFIN, CA, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS WTO BUDGET REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 50656 </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada supports the U.S. objective, outlined Reftel, to </p><p>reform the WTO budget process and move towards a two-year </p><p>budget cycle, according to Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade Senior Trade Policy Officer Dean </p><p>Steadman.  Steadman told Econoff that the WTO needs </p><p>"results-based budgetary and accounting systems" and feels </p><p>that moving towards a biennial budget process is one of a </p><p>number of reforms that should be considered. Steadman will be </p><p>the GOC point of contact on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>2. Steadman noted that he had raised the issue with the </p><p>Canadian mission in Geneva during a visit last week.  He said </p><p>that although his Geneva colleagues were supportive of the </p><p>idea, they noted that the ongoing Doha round negotiations </p><p>would make it difficult for them or others to focus on WTO </p><p>budgetary reform at this time. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
