Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  Jordanian Health Minister Dr. Walid Ma\'ani </p><p>explained his plans to create a Jordanian FDA in a meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador February 23.  The Ambassador and Ma\'ani </p><p>also discussed drug pricing and registration concerns voiced </p><p>by local PhRMA member company representatives.  Following the </p><p>meeting, the Ambassador participated in a handover ceremony, </p><p>wherein PhRMA gave computers to the Ministry to help </p><p>streamline operations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>FDA PLANS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Health Minister told the Ambassador during a </p><p>February 23 meeting that the GOJ is finalizing plans to </p><p>create a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a means to </p><p>streamline the food and drug trade in Jordan and to boost </p><p>Jordanian pharmaceutical exports, especially to the U.S. and </p><p>Europe.  Ma\'ani said he passed draft legislation to the </p><p>cabinet in mid-February, and hoped for passage of the </p><p>legislation by the end of March.  If all went well, Ma\'ani </p><p>said he hoped to have the new FDA fully functional by the end </p><p>of May. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  To that end, Ma\'ani said a state-of-the-art </p><p>building including labs and office space was already being </p><p>built to house the new agency, which would be devoted "90%" </p><p>to pharmaceutical industry issues, with one small lab for </p><p>food testing.  Ultimately, Ma\'ani said another office would </p><p>be added to certify medical equipment.  Ma\'ani said the FDA </p><p>would be a semi-autonomous regulatory agency, reporting </p><p>directly to the cabinet instead of being subsumed under any </p><p>one ministry.  He noted, though, that the Health Minister </p><p>would sit on a "board of directors" for the new agency. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  The Ambassador noted that we had passed on to HHS </p><p>and FDA the Minister\'s letter requesting technical assistance </p><p>from FDA.  He said the Minister could count on the Embassy\'s </p><p>support in moving forward with whatever decision HHS/FDA made </p><p>with regard to increasing cooperation with the GOJ. </p><p> </p><p>DRUG PRICING, REGISTRATION ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  The Ambassador raised concerns voiced to us by local </p><p>reps of multinational pharmaceutical companies and the </p><p>regional PhRMA office regarding their input into proposed </p><p>changes in Jordan\'s drug pricing and policies and </p><p>registration procedures.  On pricing, the Ambassador noted </p><p>that PhRMA companies had been left out of advisory committees </p><p>that were developing new procedures to price new-to-market </p><p>drugs.  He recommended the Minister meet with these companies </p><p>to hear their ideas, and urged him to include these companies </p><p>in committees making new policies governing the </p><p>pharmaceutical industry.  He noted that the multinational </p><p>companies would provide a valuable perspective, particularly </p><p>to ensure that new pricing policies do not inadvertently </p><p>result in reduced access to innovative drugs in Jordan.  The </p><p>Minister agreed to involve PhRMA member companies more </p><p>closely in such decision-making, and said he would be happy </p><p>to meet with them. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  On registrations, the Ambassador noted that another </p><p>proposal coming out of the advisory committees to withhold </p><p>registration in Jordan of new medicines for a year after FDA </p><p>approval as a "precautionary measure" would be </p><p>counterproductive.  First, it would deny Jordanians </p><p>expeditious access to cutting-edge life saving drugs. </p><p>Second, it would damage Jordan\'s attempts to grow its medical </p><p>tourism industry, as prospective patients would have to go </p><p>elsewhere to obtain these treatments.  The Minister agreed </p><p>that any new registration policy should keep the interests of </p><p>all actors in mind, and agreed to revisit the registration </p><p>committees proposals. </p><p> </p><p>PHRMA COMPUTER DONATION </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Following their private meeting, the Ambassador and </p><p>the Minister participated in a handover ceremony wherein </p><p>PhRMA donated 25 networked PC\'s to the Ministry\'s Drug </p><p>Directorate.  The computers, according to PhRMA regional </p><p>director Samir Mansour, should help the Ministry to reduce </p><p>the time needed to register new drugs by creating an </p><p>extensive database and by moving much of the registration </p><p>process into electronic format.  PhRMA is now identifying a </p><p>software firm to work with the Ministry to develop the </p><p>database and registration programs.  In remarks during the </p><p>ceremony, the Ambassador praised Jordan\'s strong commitment </p><p>to IPR protection and welcomed PhRMA\'s continued support for </p><p>Jordan\'s health sector. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  We understand HHS is preparing to respond favorably </p><p>to Ma\'ani\'s request for technical assistance.  We will work </p><p>with Washington agencies to develop a program to address the </p><p>GOJ\'s needs in setting up an FDA structure  and in certifying </p><p>local pharmaceutical firms for export to the U.S. of generic </p><p>drugs as appropriate.  We would note, though, that use of \'03 </p><p>ESF for this program would require negotiating with the </p><p>Planning Ministry, as \'03 ESF has already been programmed. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
