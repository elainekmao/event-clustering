(C) SUMMARY.  IN ADDITION TO ASSET SEIZURE AND </p><p>TRAVEL SANCTIONS FOCUSED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF TOP GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02567  01 OF 03  301518Z </p><p>OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW (REF A), THE HARARE COUNTRY </p><p>TEAM HAS ALSO EXPLORED WHAT VIABLE TECHNOLOGY/DUAL USE </p><p>SANCTIONS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED.  IDENTIFICATION OF ANY </p><p>MEANINGFUL SANCTIONS THAT WOULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT </p><p>CRITICAL POPULATION GROUPS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT.  THE LOW- </p><p>TECH NATURE OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY, THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE </p><p>FORCE\'S (ZDF) DEPENDENCE ON (FORMER) EAST-BLOC HARDWARE, </p><p>AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON COMMERCIAL LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>PARASTATAL/ZANU-PF COMPANIES AND U.S. SUPPLIERS ARE </p><p>IMPEDIMENTS TO TIGHTLY FOCUSED SANCTIONS THAT COULD </p><p>PINCH THE ZANU-PF RINGLEADERS WITHOUT INFLICTING SERIOUS </p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A SHORT </p><p>LIST OF OUTMODED U.S. EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE ZDF INVENTORY </p><p>THAT COULD BE TARGETED, BUT TO MINIMAL EFFECT.  WE WILL </p><p>FORWARD A LIST OF ZANU-PF-OWNED COMPANIES TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS INFORMATION IN </p><p>WASHINGTON OR ELSEWHERE ON LINKS TO U.S. SUPPLIERS.  UN </p><p>STUDIES ON EXPLOITATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CONGO\'S (DRC) RESOURCES MAY OFFER ANOTHER, MORE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL APPROACH.  EVEN HERE WE WILL NEED TO TREAD </p><p>CAREFULLY, SINCE MANY PARASTATAL/ZANU-PF FIRMS DEAL IN </p><p>CONSUMER OR SERVICE PRODUCTS.  SANCTIONS ON THESE WOULD </p><p>RISK GENERATING UNEMPLOYMENT AND FURTHER SLOWDOWN OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY, CREATING THE IMPRESSION AMONG </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN </p><p>BABY AND BATH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02567  01 OF 03  301518Z </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE EMBASSY\'S CAREFUL PREPARATIONS FOR Y2K </p><p>REVEALED INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY. </p><p>BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS IMPOSED DURING THE </p><p>UDI PERIOD, ZIMBABWE WAS FORCED TO BECOME AS SELF- </p><p>RELIANT AS POSSIBLE.  ONE RESULT WAS A RELATIVELY LOW- </p><p>TECH APPROACH TO BOTH THE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE </p><p>SECTORS.  GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY MARCHED FORWARD BUT ZIMBABWE </p><p>DID NOT.  MUCH OF ITS TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING </p><p>REMAINS TECHNOLOGICALLY STUCK IN THE 1960\'S, 1970\'S OR </p><p>1980\'S, DEPENDING UPON THE SECTOR IN QUESTION.  THIS </p><p>REMAINS TRUE OF THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AS WELL -- </p><p>OUR Y2K SURVEY INDICATED THAT THERE WERE LESS THAN 100 </p><p>COMPUTERS IN THE MOD, ALMOST ALL OF THESE STAND-ALONES </p><p>AND MANY NOT COMPATIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SINCE INDEPENDENCE, SOME SECTORS HAVE MODERNIZED </p><p>DUE TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF UP-TO- </p><p>DATE TECHNOLOGY.  FOREIGN INVESTORS LAUNCHED SEVERAL </p><p>WORLD CLASS MINING OPERATIONS (SOME NOW CLOSED).  THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR, WHICH IMPORTS MANY OF ITS </p><p>CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL INPUTS, ALSO TAKES A BACK SEAT </p><p>TO NO ONE.  HOWEVER, BOTH OF THESE SECTORS HAVE SUFFERED </p><p>SHARP DOWNTURNS DUE TO UNREALISTIC EXCHANGE RATES, THE </p><p>CONCOMITANT UNAVAILABILITY OF FOREX, AND UNENLIGHTENED </p><p>GOZ POLICIES ACROSS THE BOARD.  ALREADY ON THE ROPES, </p><p>THESE SECTORS WILL BE FURTHER WEAKENED BY EXTERNAL </p><p>SANCTIONS.  THE MEDICAL SECTOR ALSO ENJOYED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE ARE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02567  01 OF 03  301518Z </p><p>THE PROCESS OF BEING ROLLED BACK BY A DEARTH OF FUNDING </p><p>AND A LACK OF SPARE PARTS.  (A RECENT NEWS ACCOUNT </p><p>INDICATED THAT 100 PATIENTS IN BULAWAYO ARE AT RISK </p><p>BECAUSE THE DIALYSIS MACHINERY THEY NEED HAS BROKEN </p><p>DOWN.)  IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS IS OFF LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>MILITARY SANCTIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN RECENT YEARS THE ZDF HAS SHOPPED FOR MOST OF </p><p>ITS MILITARY HARDWARE IN EITHER CHINA OR THE FORMER EAST </p><p>BLOC.  ACQUISITIONS FROM THE WEST HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY </p><p>RARE.  THE ZDF MAINTAINS IN ITS INVENTORY A FEW </p><p>VENERABLE AIRCRAFT OF U.S. MANUFACTURE, INCLUDING TWELVE </p><p>BELL 412 JET RANGERS, EIGHT DAKOTA FIXED-WING </p><p>TRANSPORTS, AND TWO CESSNA 235\'S.  VERY FEW OF THESE ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY AIRWORTHY DUE TO A LACK OF SPARE PARTS. </p><p>SENIOR ZDF OFFICERS HAVE RECENTLY TOLD US THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS EQUIPMENT ALOFT, PREFERABLY WITH </p><p>U.S. ASSISTANCE.  HOWEVER, THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS </p><p>MONEY RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGY, SINCE SPARES FOR ALL OF </p><p>THESE AIRCRAFT ARE READILY AVAILABLE ON THE OPEN MARKET </p><p>WITHOUT END USER CERTIFICATION, ON A CASH BASIS.

(C) ZIMBABWE MILITARY INDUSTRIES (ZMI), ANOTHER </p><p>VESTIGE OF THE UDI POLICY OF SELF-RELIANCE, MANUFACTURE </p><p>A RANGE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT.  OUTPUT IS TAILORED FOR </p><p>THE ZDF AND OTHER SECURITY SERVICES.  UNIFORMS AND KIT </p><p>ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  LIGHT WEAPONRY </p><p>PRODUCTION INCLUDES HAND GRENADES, SMALL ARMS MUNITIONS, </p><p>40 MM ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND ROCKETS, 60 MM MORTAR TUBES </p><p>AND SHELLS, 81 MM AND 120 MM MORTAR SHELLS.  OTHER </p><p>WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND HEAVY MUNITIONS ARE ALL IMPORTED. </p><p>WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY ONLY ONE U.S. LINK TO THE </p><p>ZMI IMPORT/EXPORT CYCLE, THE EXPORT OF APPROXIMATELY </p><p>20,000 ROUNDS OF SMALL CALIBER HUNTING AMMUNITION TO A </p><p>CALIFORNIA BUYER. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>OTHER OPTIONS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BOTH SENIOR MILITARY AND ZANU-PF OFFICIALS, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE RULING PARTY ITSELF, SHARE OWNERSHIP IN </p><p>A DIVERSE BUSINESS EMPIRE THAT RANGES FROM </p><p>TRANSPORTATION TO TOURISM TO FINANCE TO MINING AND </p><p>MANUFACTURE TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS.  WE HAVE ACQUIRED A </p><p>USEFUL STUDY DONE IN 2000 THAT LISTS THESE HOLDINGS AND </p><p>THAT REVEALS SOME OF THE ZANU-PF OFFICIALS INVOLVED </p><p>BEHIND THE SCENES, INCLUDING IN VENTURES IN THE DRC. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) FOCUSING ON THE DRC ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS </p><p>(TECHNOLOGICALLY OR OTHERWISE) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02567  02 OF 03  301519Z </p><p>SINCE THE REVENUES FROM ZIMBABWEAN VENTURES THERE FLOW </p><p>INTO THE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS OF ZANU-PF INSIDERS AND NOT </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN TREASURY.  THE LOSS OF THESE REVENUES </p><p>WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY BUT </p><p>WOULD BE FELT DIRECTLY BY MUGABE CRONIES.  OSLEG LTD., A </p><p>HOLDING COMPANY, BOASTS ZDF FORCE COMMANDER ZVINAVASHE, </p><p>MOD PERMANENT SECRETARY TRUST MAPOSA, AND SPEAKER OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

(C) WE WILL PROVIDE AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION TO AF/S </p><p>TO DETERMINE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE COMMERCE OR </p><p>TREASURY DATABASES TO ESTABLISH U.S. LINKAGES WITH ZANU- </p><p>PF BUSINESS INTERESTS LOCATED IN ZIMBABWE OR DRC.  THIS </p><p>MAY BE THE BEST HOPE OF IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGIES OR </p><p>OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD GIVE TECHNOLOGY SANCTIONS </p><p>TEETH.  CROSS-REFERENCING WITH UN STUDIES THAT TRACE THE </p><p>OUTSIDE EXPLOITATION OF DRC NATURAL RESOURCES MAY ALSO </p><p>REVEAL ADDITIONAL LINKAGES AND PROVIDE THE IMPETUS TO </p><p>PUSH FOR INTERNATIONAL RATHER THAN BILATERAL MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>LIKELY RESULTS ON GOZ POLICY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.

MUGABE </p><p>WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY REACT LOUDLY TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>SANCTIONS, HARMFUL OR NOT, AND ATTEMPT TO BEND THESE TO </p><p>HIS OWN PROPAGANDA PURPOSES.  WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE </p><p>MEANINGFUL RETALIATORY MEASURES, ALTHOUGH THE GOZ COULD </p><p>THEORETICALLY TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE APPROXIMATELY 45 </p><p>AMERICAN COMPANIES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES OPERATING </p><p>HERE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ECONOMIC/TECHNOLOGY SANCTIONS LEVIED ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE MUST BE CAREFULLY FOCUSED TO AVOID COLLATERAL </p><p>DAMAGE TO AN ALREADY IMPLODING ECONOMY.  IN RECENT </p><p>REMARKS TO THE PRESS IN SOUTH AFRICA, MDC LEADER MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGARAI REPEATED THAT AT THIS TIME HE OPPOSES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL (ECONOMIC) SANCTIONS, SINCE THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ECONOMY CANNOT BEAR THE STRAIN.  IT IS OUR VIEW THAT </p><p>TECHNOLOGY OR ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL </p><p>OR EFFECT OF CREATING ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND </p><p>ERODING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WOULD BE SEEN BY MOST </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS AS SPITEFUL RATHER THAN CONSTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6739 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02567  03 OF 03  301519Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MED-07 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /018W </p><p>                  ------------------18EAE3  301519Z /38 </p><p>O 301508Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9603 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, AF/S, AND EPS; ALSO FOR EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/30/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSAL FOR LIMITED, SPECIFIED TECHNOLOGY </p><p>SANCTIONS FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
