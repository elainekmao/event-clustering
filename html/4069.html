<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-24-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PHUM, PINR, CE, Political Parties, Elections </p><p>SUBJECT:  In conversation with Ambassador, key ministers </p><p>review possible next steps after adverse court ruling </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1982, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In separate conversations with the </p><p>Ambassador, key ministers Peiris and Moragoda reviewed </p><p>GSL thinking in the wake of the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>rejection of the government\'s effort to rein in </p><p>executive powers.  In terms of next steps for the GSL, </p><p>Peiris outlined five options, which included impeaching </p><p>the president or going for an election.  Taking a softer </p><p>tack, Moragoda indicated that the two sides should try </p><p>to make cohabitation work.  Neither minister knew what </p><p>the PM planned to do.  Based on these soundings, there </p><p>is little doubt that the government is confused on how </p><p>to react and in a bit of a funk.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>A Defensive G.L. Peiris Attacks the Court </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In separate conversations with the Ambassador, </p><p>key ministers G.L. Peiris and Milinda Moragoda discussed </p><p>GSL thinking in the wake of the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>rejection of its effort to rein in executive powers. </p><p>(Note:  In its complicated decision, the court held that </p><p>the GSL\'s proposed "19th" amendment to the constitution </p><p>voiding the power of the president to call an election </p><p>one-year after the last election required a national </p><p>referendum.  The court also ruled against another </p><p>proposal allowing crossover voting in Parliament -- see </p><p>Reftels for more details.  End Note.)  At lunch with the </p><p>Ambassador on October 23, Peiris, the Minister of </p><p>Constitutional Affairs (among other portfolios), was </p><p>dismissive of the court\'s ruling, asserting that the </p><p>decision was clearly political in nature.  The Chief </p><p>Justice (Sarath Silva), Peiris related, had packed the </p><p>bench with seven supporters, edging out four justices </p><p>who had more neutral views.  This made a mockery of </p><p>President Kumaratunga\'s and her allies\' claims that the </p><p>court\'s decision was close to unanimous, when, in fact, </p><p>it was not, Peiris alleged. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Weaving a strange tale, Peiris had more </p><p>opprobrium to spill on Chief Justice Silva.  He said </p><p>Silva had sent a message to Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe three weeks ago to the effect that the </p><p>GSL "has nothing to worry about" regarding the proposed </p><p>amendment.  Clearly, based on the court\'s decision, </p><p>Silva had broken his word.  Peiris commented that he had </p><p>information that indicated that President Kumaratunga </p><p>had met with Silva and reviewed with him how she wanted </p><p>the case to be decided.  In any case, the government </p><p>knew that Silva was probably not its friend.  Silva was </p><p>known to be close to Kumaratunga and he knew that some </p><p>in the government had long wanted to impeach him on </p><p>various charges, Peiris added. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Five Options </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Queried by the Ambassador about the government\'s </p><p>next steps, Peiris set out the following five options: </p><p> </p><p>-- (1) The government takes no action. </p><p> </p><p>-- (2) The government works with the president and her </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party with the objective of </p><p>agreeing on a proposed amendment allowing the president </p><p>to call a new election three years after the last </p><p>election (versus the current one-year).  (Note:  Per </p><p>Reftel, the Supreme Court indicated in its decision that </p><p>such a proposal would pass constitutional review.) </p><p>Peiris was not sure the president would agree to this </p><p>idea.  If she did not, the proposal would not get </p><p>through Parliament (where two-thirds support was </p><p>needed). </p><p>-- (3) The government could try to impeach the president </p><p>on long-standing abuse of power charges. </p><p> </p><p>-- (4) The government could dissolve Parliament and ask </p><p>the president to call a parliamentary election.  If </p><p>Kumaratunga refused to do this, the GSL could take steps </p><p>to cut her budget. </p><p> </p><p>-- (5) After obtaining President Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>agreement, the government could dissolve Parliament and </p><p>call an election. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Peiris said the PM had not yet decided which </p><p>path to take.  For his part, Peiris indicated that he </p><p>wanted to take a hard-line position toward Kumaratunga. </p><p>He averred that it was impossible for anyone to trust </p><p>anything she said, as everything she did was politically </p><p>expedient.  Given this, Peiris indicated that the best </p><p>course of action probably involved pressing for an </p><p>election, per options 4-5 above. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Moragoda Takes a Softer Tack </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In his October 24 conversation with Ambassador </p><p>Wills, Milinda Moragoda, the Minister of Economic </p><p>Reform, took a softer tack than Peiris did.  Moragoda </p><p>related that he had met on October 23 with former </p><p>Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a key aide to the </p><p>president.  Based on Kadirgamar\'s comments, Moragoda </p><p>felt that the president might be in a cooperative mood </p><p>and perhaps it might be possible to work with her. </p><p>Agreeing with Peiris, Moragoda said he was not sure of </p><p>where the prime minister would come down on the </p><p>situation.  The PM was still mulling over the options. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  Both Moragoda and Peiris also expressed </p><p>concerns about the ongoing tensions in the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress "SLMC" -- see Reftels.  Moragoda said he </p><p>had heard that the leader of the rebel SLMC faction had </p><p>given the government a letter signed by nine MPs </p><p>outlining deep concerns about the peace process.  While </p><p>the SLMC\'s apparent fracturing threatened the </p><p>government\'s majority in Parliament, Moragoda did not </p><p>think the government would fall because it could rely on </p><p>the support of the Tamil National Alliance.  Peiris said </p><p>he thought Kumaratunga was using the SLMC rebels in a </p><p>bid to destabilize the government.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) (((Note:  For her part, President Kumaratunga is </p><p>scheduled to give an address to the nation on TV </p><p>tonight.  While expressing her support for the court\'s </p><p>decision, Kumaratunga is said to be planning to use the </p><p>speech to set a cooperative tone re cohabitation, </p><p>according to sources.  It is not clear whether she plans </p><p>to make any remarks regarding the peace process.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) We had heard that the government was confused </p><p>about how to respond to the court\'s ruling and these </p><p>conversations confirmed it.  Peiris, who was the primary </p><p>author of the proposed amendment shot down by the court, </p><p>was defensive, indicating that he thought the government </p><p>had to take the fight to Kumaratunga.  (Note:  Peiris </p><p>defected from the Kumaratunga\'s PA party last year and </p><p>has a deep grudge against her.)  Moragoda -- clearly </p><p>resentful of Peiris, feeling that his animus toward the </p><p>president was getting in the way of sounder judgement -- </p><p>wanted a renewed effort to make cohabitation work.  In </p><p>the meantime, the PM seems to have fallen back into his </p><p>Hamlet-like ways, after months of appearing decisive on </p><p>such matters as the peace process.  The winner in all </p><p>this confusion is clearly Kumaratunga, who has given the </p><p>government a real black eye.  The peace process itself </p><p>does not appear to have been effected as of yet.  That </p><p>might not last, however:  If the GSL becomes focused on </p><p>mere survival, its peace initiative could well take a </p><p>back seat.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
