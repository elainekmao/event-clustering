<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 035835 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, P, C/E, S/P, AND EUR/SOV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PNAT, PREL, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GEORGIAN REPUBLIC\'S RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  GEORGIANS SEE UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE </p><p>SEALING THE FATE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND RESULTING </p><p>IN, AT MOST, A MINOR ADVISORY ROLE FOR THE CENTER. </p><p>REPUBLIC LEADERS CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR U.S. </p><p>DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN TBILISI AND FOR OUR </p><p>MORAL/POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>OPINION ON YEL\'TSIN AND RUSSIA IS DIVIDED.  MOST SEE </p><p>THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AS LESS THREATENING THAN THE </p><p>SOVIET, BUT FEAR ADDITIONAL COUPS COULD UNSEAT MOSCOW </p><p>REFORMERS.  DISTRUST OF SHEVARDNADZE IS GROWING.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>END OF THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING DECEMBER 4-7 VISIT BY EMBOFFS TO TBILISI, </p><p>GEORGIAN INTERLOCUTORS OPINED THE DEMISE OF THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION IN THE WAKE OF THE UKRAINIAN </p><p>REFERENDUM.  BOTH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION SOURCES </p><p>FELT THE UKRAINIAN VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE OPENED THE </p><p>FINL ACT FOR THE SOVIET UNION.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>GEORGIAN NEWS AGENCY, IRAKLI KENCHASHVILI, SAID </p><p>GORBACHEV WAS FIGHTING AGAINST A HISTORICAL PROCESS, </p><p>SINCE EMPIRES CANNOT SURVIVE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. </p><p>OPPOSITION PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FORMER HEAD OF THE </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, TEDO PAATASHVILI, SAID </p><p>THAT IN PRACTICAL TERMS NO REPUBLIC REALLY NEEDS THE </p><p>CENTER.  HE PREDICTED THE MOST CENTER OFFICIALS COULD </p><p>HOPE FOR IS A VERY LOOSE ASSOCIATION, PROVIDING </p><p>SUGGESTIONS TO INDEPENDENT STATES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>REQUEST FOR U.S. MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SOURCES REQUESTED </p><p>U.S. MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR GEORGIA\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, CLAIMING THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE </p><p>ARE BEHIND THE CURVE ON THE SOVIET DEMISE. </p><p>PROCURATOR GENERAL ABAKELIA STATED THERE IS NO REASON </p><p>FOR THE U.S. TO RECOGNIZE THE UKRAINE, BUT NOT </p><p>GEORGIA.  IN A SESSION WITH PARLIAMENTARIANS, THE </p><p>FATHER OF JAILED OPPOSITION JOURNALIST GEORGIY </p><p>HAINDRAVA TOLD EMBOFFS THE U.S. HAD HISTORICALLY LET </p><p>GEORGIA DOWN, BEING IN 1920 THE ONLY GREAT POWER NOT </p><p>TO RECOGNIZE ITS INDEPENDENT STATUS, AND NOW AVOIDING </p><p>ANY STATEMENT CONGRATULATING GEORGIA\'S DECLARATION OF </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  IN APPEALING FOR U.S. SUPPORT, </p><p>GEORGIANS OF ALL STRIPES POINTED OUT THAT GEORGIA </p><p>CONTAINS A SEPARATE PEOPLE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION AND </p><p>CULTURE FROM RUSSIA; HAS AN OLD TRADITION OF </p><p>STATEHOOD; AND CONSTITUTES NO THREAT TO ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS.  BY SUPPORTING THE REPUBLICS, THEY ARGUE, </p><p>THE U.S. CAN DEMONSTRATE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY NEED </p><p>OF EMPIRES.  THEY CLAIMED AN INDEPENDENT, &HRISTIAN </p><p>GEORGIA, LOCATED IN THE MIDST OF MOSLEM NEIGHBORS, </p><p>COULD POSITIVELY INFLUENCE EVENTS IN TURKEY, IRAN, </p><p>AND THE REST OF THE MOSLEM WORLD.  THEY ALSO ARGUED </p><p>THAT AN INDEPENDENT GEORGIA COULD PLAY A GREATER ROLE </p><p>IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA.  IN </p><p>ARGUING FOR A U.S. DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN TBILISI, THE </p><p>GEORGIAN OPPOSITION STATED THAT ISOLATION FROM THE </p><p>WEST WOULD NOT HELP THE LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SITUATION.  A U.S. MISSION, THEY SAID, COULD </p><p>INFLUENCE LOCAL EVENTS AND "CONSTRAIN THE </p><p>DICTATOR." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>HOPE FOR RUSSIAN MODERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  OPINION WAS DIVIDED ON RUSSIA\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE REPUBLICS.  SOME SOURCES, LIKE PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF </p><p>OF STAFF, MERAB KLIMIASHVILI, SEEMED LESS WORRIED </p><p>ABOUT YEL\'TSIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, FEELING </p><p>THAT ITS IMPERIAL AMBITIONS, UNLIKE THE SOVIET </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S, HAVE FINALLY BEEN LAID TO REST.  AS HE </p><p>PUT IT, "THANK GOD RUSSIA FINALLY WANTS TO LIVE ON </p><p>ITS OWN."  KLIMIASHVILI STILL HAD SOME CONCERNS, </p><p>HOWEVER, SINCE HE SAW DEMOCRATS IN MOSCOW IN THE </p><p>MINORITY.  HE PERCEIVED A CONTINUING DANGER "THAT </p><p>HEIRS OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM WITH TOTALITARIAN, </p><p>IMPERIALIST, NON-DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES COULD REASSERT </p><p>THEMSELVES."  THIS SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED BY OPPOSITION </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN PAATASHVILI, WHO DID NOT FEAR A </p><p>STRONG RUSSIAN REPUBLIC "IF IT SAYS IT DOESN\'T WANT </p><p>TERRITORIES BEYOND ITS BORDERS."  CITING YEL\'TSIN\'S </p><p>MODERATE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE UKRAINIAN REFERENDUM, </p><p>PAATASHVILI SAID THAT RUSSIA, UNLIKE THE CENTER, IS A </p><p>LARGE COUNTRY IN ITS OWN RIGHT, AND IS NOT RELIANT ON </p><p>AN ARTIFICIAL EMPIRE.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED THE CAVEAT </p><p>OF UNCERTAINTY OVER FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SAYING "THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT MORE SERIOUS COUPS COULD LEAD </p><p>TO CONTROL BY A MILITARY LEADER WHO WOULD TRY TO </p><p>RESTORE EVERYTHING."  HE ALSO ADMITED THAT SMALL </p><p>NATIONS WITHIN THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC HAVE MORE TO FEAR </p><p>THAN THE SEPARATE REPUBLICS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  OTHER SOURCES WERE MORE CAUTIOUS ON THE RUSSIAN </p><p>REPUBLIC.  IN GENERAL, SOVIET, RATHER THAN RUSSIAN, </p><p>TROOPS WERE CASTIGATED FOR INCITING TROUBLES IN </p><p>OSSETIA (SEPTEL), PROMPTING A CURRENT BILL BEFORE THE </p><p>LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY AND </p><p>NAVAL ELEMENTS FROM GEORGIAN TERRITORY.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, HOWEVER, RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS WERE SEEN AS </p><p>PROVIDING DISINFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE SOVIETS. </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER TENGIZ SIGUA BLAMED BOTH RUSSIA </p><p>AND THE CENTER FOR PROBLEMS IN OSSETIA, SAYING </p><p>COMPETITION BETWEEN THE MOSCOW "WHITE HOUSE" AND THE </p><p>KREMLIN LEAVES LOCAL SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY AND KGB </p><p>FORCES BEYOND ANYONE\'S CONTROL.  SEVERAL </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS ALSO IMPLIED LINGERING FEAR OF RUSSIAN </p><p>EXPANSIONISM.  ONE GEORGIAN LEGISLATOR CLAIMED THAT </p><p>EVEN DEMOCRATS IN RUSSIA NEVER UNDERSTOOD SMALL </p><p>NATIONS LIKE GEORGIA.  NEWS DIRECTOR KENSCHASVILI HAD </p><p>NO USE FOR THE CENTER OR RUSSIA.  HE SAID "EARLIER WE </p><p>NEEDED GORBACHEV, THEN WE NEEDED YEL\'TSIN, NOW WE </p><p>DON\'T EVEN NEED HIM."  ONE OPPOSITION SOURCE TOLD </p><p>CIRCUIT RIDERS HE FEARED YEL\'TSIN AS WELL, SAYING THE </p><p>RUSSIAN PRESIDENT WILL "SHOW HIS TEETH YET." </p><p> </p><p>7.  THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISTRUST OF SHEVARDNADZE </p><p>WHOSE RE-EMERGENCE AS SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER WAS </p><p>SEEN BY THE NEWS DIRECTOR AND OTHERS AS </p><p>OPPORTUNISTIC.  BOTH PRESIDENT GAMASHKURDIA (SEPTEL) </p><p>AND OPPOSITION LEADERS LABELLED SHEVARDNADZE A </p><p>REMNANT OF THE BREZHNEV SYSTEM, REMEMBERED FOR HIS </p><p>ROLE AS REPUBLIC FIRST SECRETARY.  GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>CALLED SHEVARDNADZE "A GREAT ACTOR" WHO FEIGNED A </p><p>SPLIT WITH GORBACHEV SO HE COULD RETURN TO GEORGIA </p><p>AND HOLD IT IN THE UNION.  THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>ADDED THAT SHEVARDNADZE IS TO THIS DAY STILL LEADING </p><p>THE FIGHT AGAINST GEORGIA\'S NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, </p><p>USING THE LOCAL COMMUNIST MAFIA TO CREATE DISSENT AND </p><p>ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
