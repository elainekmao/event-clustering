<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/FO, EUR/WE, EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EU, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EUR A/S JONES DISCUSSIONS WITH PM DIP ADVISOR </p><p>CASTELLANETA AND MFA SYG BALDOCCI </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 3368 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/POL M%$1Qerline the US desire </p><p>to work closely with the EU on critical issues: MEPP, </p><p>trafficking in persons, and transatlantic security structures </p><p>are among the most important.  Baldocci was hopeful that </p><p>early consultations when disagreements arise could avoid </p><p>rifts in our relations.  He pointed to the intense talks in </p><p>the Quint prior to the Kosovo conflict as an example of how </p><p>quiet diplomacy can avoid public disagreements. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>UNSC Reform </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Castellaneta said he was concerned about British plans </p><p>for UNSC reform, which he understood were discussed during PM </p><p>Blair\'s trip to Washington.  Italy agrees that reform is </p><p>necessary, but simply adding several new countries to the </p><p>UNSC (Japan, Germany, Brazil, India) is not the answer.   We </p><p>should proceed cautiously.  Baldocci confirmed that UNSC </p><p>reform is under study in the MFA; the Italian government is </p><p>studying possible configurations that would preserve the </p><p>status of the P5 but allow an expanded role for other large </p><p>countries on a rotating basis.  A/S Jones said she would </p><p>convey Italian concerns in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Biotechnology </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A/S Jones pressed for Italian leadership, as EU </p><p>President, for progress on biotech.  The US Congress is </p><p>focusing on the issue, and is not happy with EU labeling </p><p>plans.  Castellaneta said the EU Parliament vote on </p><p>traceability and labeling will allow lifting of the </p><p>moratorium on new biotech product approvals.  He called the </p><p>seizure and destruction of corn crops in Northern Italy this </p><p>past week "stupid," and acknowledged divisions within the </p><p>Italian government on this issue.  He said that Berlusconi is </p><p>personally focused on the problem. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Middle East </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A/S Jones noted the visit of Sharon and Abu Mazen to </p><p>Washington at the end of the month.  Castellaneta underlined </p><p>Italian/EU support for the Road Map, and said that the EU </p><p>would be willing to send civilian monitors/observers to the </p><p>region when appropriate.  A/S Jones thanked Castellaneta for </p><p>this offer, but pointed out that is too early to think about </p><p>deploying monitors.  Baldocci highlighted the need for </p><p>financial support for the region, noting PM Berlusconi\'s </p><p>"Marshall Plan" was ready to implement when the time is </p><p>right.  The MEPP/Roadmap will be an important topic of </p><p>conversation at the July 21 GAERC.  He said Italy wanted to </p><p>exploit its perception in the Middle East as a European </p><p>country with a "balanced" view towards all sides.  A/S Jones </p><p>said that the USG looks forward to working with </p><p>newly-appointed Special Envoy Otte and through the Quartet </p><p>process to move the peace process forward in the coming </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Castellaneta noted the Italian offer to hold a Middle </p><p>East conference in Sicily.  A/S Jones said we need to focus </p><p>on implementing the first stages of the Road Map, including </p><p>confidence building measures.  She stressed the importance of </p><p>Berlusconi\'s developing a strong personal relationship with </p><p>Sharon.  This would be necessary for possible Israeli </p><p>acceptance of EU monitors at a later stage.  Baldocci and </p><p>Castellaneta underlined the importance of financial support </p><p>for the region and support for the G-8/Evian approach to </p><p>reconstruction and of a $5-7 billion international fund to be </p><p>utilized when conditions on the ground allow.  Castellaneta </p><p>asked about the Department\'s (NEA) Middle East Partnership </p><p>Initiative.  A/S Jones explained its focus was on education </p><p>and civil society projects in the Middle East in general, not </p><p>just on the Palestinian/Israeli dispute.  A/S Jones stressed </p><p>enhancing Abu Mazen\'s support so that he can become an </p><p>interlocutor for Sharon.   Castellaneta noted that Berlusconi </p><p>would be speaking with Abu Mazen later that day, and that </p><p>Palestinian and Israeli Foreign Ministers would be at the </p><p>GAERC on July 21. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) A/S Jones summarized Ambassador Bremer\'s efforts to </p><p>address security issues in Iraq while simultaneously working </p><p>on a political track.  Castellaneta said Italy welcomes the </p><p>formation of the Governing Council, and has arranged </p><p>financing (USD 300 Million) to deploy 3000 troops to Iraq. </p><p>He said that Italy had already sent several civilian experts </p><p>to work with the Iraqi civilian administration, and would </p><p>like to deploy more.  A/S Jones welcomed Castellaneta\'s offer </p><p>to send some 50 experts in all, and said she would try to </p><p>facilitate their deployment with Amb. Bremer.  Castellaneta </p><p>said Italy was favorable to an eventual larger NATO role in </p><p>Iraq.  A/S Jones said the US and Italy should consult on how </p><p>to use NATO most effectively. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iran </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Castellaneta said that an Italian-Iranian economic </p><p>commission had met in recent days, and DPM Fini had </p><p>discussions the previous week with Iranian Min. of Industries </p><p>& Mines Eshaq Jahangiri.  Castellaneta expressed Italian </p><p>unhappiness with the IAEA\'s failure to gain any further </p><p>concrete information on Iran\'s nuclear program, and noted </p><p>Italy\'s willingness to continue to serve as a communication </p><p>channel between Iran and the US. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  A/S Jones said the EU needed to ask itself hard </p><p>questions about the effectiveness of its "critical dialogue" </p><p>with Iran.  What has it achieved?  Iranian behavior on human </p><p>rights, media, its nuclear program, and terrorism is </p><p>deteriorating, not improving.  The issue is: how can we </p><p>influence Iranian behavior to get the results we want?  The </p><p>IAEA will present its report to the Security Council in </p><p>August; the US expects it to be very critical and generate </p><p>significant discussion.  Castellaneta and A/S Jones agreed on </p><p>the need to continue to urge Russia to withhold further </p><p>support for Iran\'s nuclear program.  They noted that Putin </p><p>has been saying more of the right things lately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>OSCE/Frozen Conflicts </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) A/S Jones outlined Russian recalcitrance on </p><p>fulfilling Istanbul commitments for withdrawal from Moldova </p><p>and Georgia.  On the edge of an enlarged Europe, Russia was </p><p>acting like the old Soviet Union.  The Russian MFA is the </p><p>main problem, and the EU needs to let Putin know that Europe </p><p>is concerned about this behavior.  Castellaneta agreed, and </p><p>noted that Berlusconi will have two opportunities to do this: </p><p>at a planned Berlusconi-Putin meeting in Sochi at the end of </p><p>July, and at the Rome EU-Russia summit in November. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Galileo </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  A/S Jones agreed with Baldocci\'s and Castellaneta\'s </p><p>assertion that technical work should continue on Galileo, but </p><p>said that political-level decisions will be essential to </p><p>solving this issue.  A/DCM (ECMIN) noted that time is </p><p>limited; the issue needs to be resolved during the Italian </p><p>Presidency, before the December Transport Council meeting. </p><p>He said that US-Italy talks in Rome this week did not appear </p><p>to have made much progress.  Castellaneta agreed, and </p><p>promised to personally engage on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Defense Industrial Cooperation </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Castellaneta said that Italy wanted to strengthen </p><p>bilateral defense industrial cooperation with the US, but he </p><p>argued that Italy is not getting the same return on its </p><p>investment in the Joint Strike Fighter program as other </p><p>participants.  The Agusta-Westland helicopter sale is </p><p>extremely important to Italy, and he underlined Italy\'s view </p><p>that it is not getting the same access to US technology as </p><p>other close Allies.  A/S Jones said A/S Bloomfield is working </p><p>intensively on a technology transfer policy; she would convey </p><p>Italy\'s concerns in Washington, but was not aware of any </p><p>categorization by country. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Turkey </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  A/S Jones noted that Turkish FM Gul would be in </p><p>Washington the following week for meetings, including with VP </p><p>Cheney.  The USG applauds the new laws passed in Ankara, but </p><p>now the time has come to implement reforms on human rights, </p><p>prison conditions and use of the Kurdish language.  Baldocci </p><p>promised to ask the Italian Embassy in Washington to contact </p><p>the State Department with EU Presidency points on Turkish </p><p>reform and Turkey\'s EU aspirations. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) A/S Jones has cleared this cable. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03388 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
