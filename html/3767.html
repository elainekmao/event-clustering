Summary.  Ref a requested that Post discuss the impact </p><p>of the elimination of import quotas in 2005 on Honduras\' </p><p>textile and apparel industry and plans in the government and </p><p>private sector to diversify into other industrial sectors. </p><p>Embassy has been carrying on a dialogue with the GOH and </p><p>Honduran private sector for the past year on the subject. </p><p>The Honduran textile industry will try to survive through </p><p>vertical integration and duty free status in the U.S. </p><p>market.  The government hopes to attract new investment in </p><p>other light manufacturing, tourism, agribusiness and </p><p>forestry.  There is limited awareness of U.S. financing </p><p>programs.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Textile and Apparel Industry Gearing Up for 2005 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2.  As reported in ref b, Honduran maquila industry leaders </p><p>recognize that quota elimination in 2005 presents a major </p><p>challenge to the Honduran industry.  Unrestrained by quotas, </p><p>companies operating in Asia (generally considered much more </p><p>competitive) will drive down prices for textiles and apparel </p><p>tremendously.  Industry leaders are gambling that Honduras\' </p><p>industry will survive based on duty free treatment in the </p><p>U.S. and its close proximity to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Companies are working to improve Honduran </p><p>competitiveness by installing more efficient machinery and </p><p>moving away from cut and sew operations to full package </p><p>regimes.  Due to a lack of affordable financing in the </p><p>Honduran banking system, U.S. companies (with access to </p><p>financing from U.S. banks) are largely responsible for the </p><p>implementation of full package operations in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The rapid growth of the Honduran maquila sector over the </p><p>last decade is due in part to an incentives program the GOH </p><p>provides for apparel assembly plants operating in designated </p><p>export processing zones.  Companies are exempt from paying </p><p>import duties on goods and capital equipment and from state </p><p>and municipal taxes.  The GOH will continue to provide </p><p>incentives until 2010 per WTO rules allowing countries with </p><p>GDP per capita under USD 1,000 to maintain free trade zones. </p><p>The general manager of the Honduran Maquila Association </p><p>(AHM) commented that in anticipation of the WTO-prohibition </p><p>on government incentives programs, the AHM is already </p><p>engaging the GOH on alternative ways to attract (and </p><p>maintain) investment in the sector. </p><p> </p><p>5.  To date, Honduras has had limited success in </p><p>diversifying its textile and apparel production.  One </p><p>industry contact decried the poor job the sector has done in </p><p>shedding the image of Honduras as primarily a t-shirt </p><p>manufacturing center.  The contact suggested that the GOH </p><p>and private sector make a more concerted effort to attract </p><p>companies producing higher-value finished products like </p><p>fashion wear and women\'s attire. </p><p> </p><p>Hopes Rest on U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Industry representatives argue that a U.S.-Central </p><p>American free trade agreement (USCAFTA) is essential for the </p><p>sector to be able to compete in 2005 and beyond.  They hope </p><p>that a USCAFTA will give Honduras NAFTA-like parity and at </p><p>the very least, solidify the unilateral trade preferences </p><p>Honduras now enjoys under the CBTPA.  Industry contacts </p><p>report that Honduras, which is the largest manufacturer of </p><p>knit apparel and t-shirts among CBTPA beneficiary countries, </p><p>expects to benefit the most from recent provisions in the </p><p>Trade Act of 2002 increasing the caps on quotas for these </p><p>categories. </p><p> </p><p>Plans for Diversification </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Maduro government\'s recently published economic plan </p><p>focuses on the need to create an attractive climate for </p><p>foreign investment.  The GOH\'s plan recognizes the need to </p><p>facilitate the incorporation of a business in Honduras, seek </p><p>out new trade and investment opportunities through free </p><p>trade agreements, strengthen the judicial system and resolve </p><p>land tenancy problems that hinder investment (especially </p><p>along Honduras\' Caribbean coast).  Septel will discuss </p><p>current plans to attack the land tenure issues. </p><p> </p><p>8.  President Maduro created an entity called the </p><p>Competitiveness Council to tackle investment climate issues </p><p>in Honduras.  The Council, which is headed by Vice President </p><p>Vicente Williams and includes private sector, labor, </p><p>Congress representatives and local government officials, is </p><p>charged with reviewing and drafting modifications to </p><p>Honduras\' existing legal framework to encourage new business </p><p>development.  The Council recently succeeded in pushing </p><p>through the National Congress the Administrative </p><p>Simplification Law which reduces some bureaucratic hurdles </p><p>to establishing a business in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Maduro appointed Camilo Atala to a new position of </p><p>Minister without Portfolio for Investment.  Atala (who is </p><p>also the president of Bank Ficohsa) is responsible for </p><p>promoting large investment projects with potential to create </p><p>substantial numbers of jobs.  He is the point of contact for </p><p>large international companies seeking meetings with the </p><p>President and charged with clearing bureaucratic obstacles </p><p>for these projects. </p><p> </p><p>10.  As advocated by consultant Michael Porter (a recent </p><p>speaker in Tegucigalpa), the Maduro administration will </p><p>concentrate on developing clusters - sectors with high </p><p>potential to create jobs and related economic activity. </p><p>This includes the attraction of other light industry </p><p>(including electronics), developing Honduras\' tourism </p><p>potential, strengthening the agro-industry and exploiting </p><p>Honduras\' natural resources (primarily forestry and mining). </p><p> </p><p>11.  There has been limited success in attracting non- </p><p>textile light assembly operations.  The ZIP Calpules </p><p>industrial park (located in San Pedro Sula), for example, is </p><p>already home to a biotechnology firm that propagates </p><p>cultivars (primarily banana) for export and businesses </p><p>producing wire harnesses and high-end doors and furnishings </p><p>made from Honduran mahogany for export, among others. </p><p>Recently, a U.S. company manufacturing wire harnesses for </p><p>U.S. automakers announced plans to hire 1,500 new employees. </p><p>The company has also expanded into building high cost mail </p><p>sorters for major U.S. buyers and has plans to expand into </p><p>other high-value assembly operations. </p><p> </p><p>12.  USAID has enjoyed success with its agricultural </p><p>diversification program run by FINTRAC, an U.S. company </p><p>working with small farmers to diversify into profitable </p><p>nontraditional agriculture exports (primarily vegetables). </p><p>Through the use of improved production and processing </p><p>technologies, FINTRAC has helped many participating small </p><p>farmers access the U.S. agricultural market. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A USDA-funded hot water treatment plant for mangos </p><p>began operating in April 2002, permitting Honduran mango </p><p>producers for the first time to meet U.S. med-fly </p><p>phytosanitary requirements.  USDA expects the use of the </p><p>plant to be expanded to include papayas during the mango </p><p>growing season.  USDA has also worked with Honduran cheese </p><p>producers to meet U.S. sanitary restrictions and qualify to </p><p>export ethnic cheese products to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Challenges to Diversification </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The challenges to improvement of the investment climate </p><p>are formidable.  The judicial system continues to be weak </p><p>and inefficient; the courts are easily manipulated and it is </p><p>difficult to enforce contracts.  An August 2001 law </p><p>permitting arbitration led to the creation of Honduras\' </p><p>first arbitration center in the Tegucigalpa Chamber of </p><p>Commerce; however, only one case has been submitted for </p><p>arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The GOH has been unable to envision a solution to </p><p>existing land disputes and the greater problem of land </p><p>tenancy in Honduras.  The Agrarian Reform Law, which </p><p>resulted in the titling of land for hundreds of thousands of </p><p>Honduras\' landless poor, has encouraged land invasions in </p><p>some cases.  The Maduro administration is in the process of </p><p>developing a law to consolidate Honduras\' land registries </p><p>and modify the Agrarian Reform Law; however, it may be a </p><p>long time before any progress is made on land issues. </p><p> </p><p>16.  A fragile Honduran banking system and high interest, </p><p>short-term loans continue to stifle new investment. </p><p>Attempts to privatize the electricity distribution system </p><p>and telecom sectors have been met with resistance in the </p><p>private sector and National Congress.  Meanwhile, </p><p>electricity prices and telephone rates are among the highest </p><p>in the region. </p><p>17.  Recent minimum wage hikes, the implementation of double </p><p>salary payments in June and December, high severance payment </p><p>requirements and a government mandated increase in employer </p><p>social security contributions have all contributed to an </p><p>increase in the cost of doing business in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>Role of USG Financing Programs </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  There is limited awareness of USG financing programs </p><p>such as the Oversees Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), </p><p>the Export-Import Bank and the Trade Development Agency </p><p>(TDA).  The TDA is working with Honduras\' telecom regulatory </p><p>agency (CONATEL) on studies to strengthen and liberalize the </p><p>telecom sector.  We are aware of little OPIC or Ex-Im </p><p>financing at this time.  USDA recently put on a well- </p><p>attended seminar on its agricultural financing programs.  A </p><p>similar seminar on opportunities for OPIC, Ex-Im Bank and </p><p>TDA opportunities would be welcome. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
