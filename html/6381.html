<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DAKAR FOR FAA; BRUSSELS FOR FAA AND TSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10 March 2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, EAIR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - WORLD AIRWAYS, CATEGORY ONE AND SECTION </p><p>557 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reason:  1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) President Obasanjo convoked Ambassador to his </p><p>residence Sunday evening, March. DCM accompanied.  After </p><p>the President had finished his agenda (captioned septel, </p><p>notal), the Ambassador briefed him on Section 557 and </p><p>raised two civil aviation concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Jeter had briefed MoD Danjuma March 7 on </p><p>the Congressionally mandated suspension of FY-03 Nigeria </p><p>IMET and FMF programs and wondered if Danjuma had reported </p><p>to the President.  Obasanjo said Danjuma had poked his head </p><p>into the office on Friday to say he was back from sick </p><p>leave; they did not, however, hold a discussion.  The </p><p>Ambassador explained that there was a new development on </p><p>Benue, a Congressionally mandated provision.  Section 557 </p><p>precluded expenditure of new (FY-03) money on IMET but </p><p>would not impact pipeline FMF projects, including the C-130 </p><p>program, Buoy tenders, and the simulation center. Obasanjo </p><p>sighed and said: "You have your troubles with legislators </p><p>too."  Ambassador explained that the legislator concerned </p><p>took human rights issues very seriously, and although $8.7 </p><p>million remained in ongoing programs, this cost to Nigeria </p><p>could be ratched up if the Benue issue were not resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador then raised World Airways\' </p><p>application to operate air service to Nigeria, noting that </p><p>World was a fully-qualified carrier certified by the U.S. </p><p>Department of Transportation and that there should be no </p><p>issue.  Obasanjo agreed and asked what the problem was. </p><p>The Ambassador replied that there appeared to be a conflict </p><p>between the Minister of Aviation and the travel agency </p><p>marketing the tickets, RiteTime.  Obasanjo then said the </p><p>solution was for World to find a different marketer. </p><p>COMMENT:  The Embassy is not privy to the details of </p><p>World\'s $22 million contract with RiteTime, but we believe </p><p>that Obasanjo\'s solution may not be viable. RiteTime, not </p><p>World Airways, is the deal-maker in this venture and is </p><p>assuming the majority of the risk involved, including the </p><p>payment of a $250,000 advance to World Airways. Based on </p><p>our conversations with World Airways officials last week, </p><p>without RiteTime, World Airways will not fly to Nigeria. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador advised President Obasanjo that there </p><p>was one more bit of information that he need to pass along: </p><p>(Obasanjo joked saying that the Ambassador initially </p><p>indicated that there were only two issues that he wanted to </p><p>raise).  The effort to gain Category I certification for </p><p>Nigeria was at risk because the independence of NCAA </p><p>(Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority) from the Ministry of </p><p>Aviation was not assured.  The draft legislation stipulated </p><p>that the Minister "may" give NCAA independence; the </p><p>operative verb needed to be "shall."  Obasanjo said "may" </p><p>would become "shall" if he could make the change.  COMMENT: </p><p>The legislation in question has not yet passed the National </p><p>Assembly, so the President can probably have it changed. </p><p>The problem is that Minister Chikwe does not want to give </p><p>NCAA independence, because lack of jurisdiction over NCAA </p><p>will significantly weaken her authority. We hope Obasanjo </p><p>will hold the line.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
