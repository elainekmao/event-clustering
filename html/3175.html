<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ETTC, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA AND NASCO - THE TRUSTEESHIP OPTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SUMMARY OF AHMED IDRIS NASREDDIN COMPANIES </p><p>     B. 01 STATE 207526 </p><p>     C. STATE 10592 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 0187 </p><p>     E. EPSTEIN/ANDREWS EMAIL 6FEB02 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 0418 </p><p>     G. DATTA/ANDREWS EMAIL 24MAY02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASONS 1.6X1, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  If placing NASCO under trusteeship is a USG </p><p>priority, we suggest the Secretary raise it when he calls on </p><p>Obasanjo 21 June.  Approaches at other levels are unlikely to </p><p>bear fruit.  However, action against NASCO could result in </p><p>collateral damage to bilateral relations far exceeding the </p><p>value of the target.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Background: Ref C identified companies belonging to </p><p>the NASCO Group as possible sources of financing for </p><p>international terrorism and sought Mission views on adding </p><p>them to the E.O.13224 assets freeze list.  The Mission </p><p>provided detailed information on the role NASCO plays in the </p><p>economy of Nigeria\'s eastern Middle Belt and advised that a </p><p>thorough and well-documented analysis of the NASCO companies\' </p><p>role in financing international terrorism would be needed to </p><p>convince the Government of Nigerian (GON) to freeze NASCO </p><p>assets, an action that would put the companies out of </p><p>business, with attendant consequences for employees and </p><p>suppliers.  Pursuant to Ref E, the Mission discussed at </p><p>length possible palliative measures but could identify </p><p>nothing significant and so reported ref F.  The Department </p><p>subsequently provided Ref A, along with a request (ref G) </p><p>that the Mission informally explore whether the GON would be </p><p>amenable to placing the NASCO companies under a trustee. </p><p>Theoretically, this option would permit the companies to </p><p>remain in operation, generating benefits for Nigerians, while </p><p>preventing profits from falling into the wrong hands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Actions Taken: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A) Regional Affairs Counselor about two weeks ago gave Ref A </p><p>to National Security Advisor LTG Aliyu Mohammed (ret), along </p><p>with a summary of what the USG was seeking.  Mohammed did not </p><p>respond to the request directly, but commented that he </p><p>thought Nasreddin had not visited Nigeria in recent years. </p><p>RAO/C did not have the impression that Mohammed would quickly </p><p>take action along the lines of our request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B) CDA 18 June broached the issue informally with MFA </p><p>Permanent Secretary T.D. Hart, asking Hart\'s "advice" on how </p><p>best to approach the GON.  CDA did not mention that RAO/C had </p><p>spoken with Mohammed.  Hart is very sympathetic to us on </p><p>anti-terrorism issues.  He said such a matter should normally </p><p>be put before the NSA.  However, because of intertwined </p><p>religious and political issues, the NSA would be hard-put to </p><p>act.  Hart thought aloud a bit and concluded that the best </p><p>approach would be for a special emissary or USG delegation to </p><p>present our case directly to President Obasanjo.  He could </p><p>not come up with any other avenue that would yield the </p><p>results we seek in reasonable time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Comment: Hart\'s conclusion on what Mohammed would </p><p>likely do matched RAO/C\'s initial assessment.  Now that </p><p>Nigeria is entering an electoral cycle, every action that </p><p>might be contemplated is subjected to an assessment of how it </p><p>would play domestically -- not so much with respect to the </p><p>general public but more terms of how well-informed political </p><p>elites would react.  While there is substantial support for </p><p>choking off funding for bin Ladin, Ref A does not establish a </p><p>very clear link between NASCO, on the one hand, and bin </p><p>Ladin, al Qaeda or the GSPC, on the other.  Rather it asserts </p><p>that there exists evidence linking Nasreddin, through Bank Al </p><p>Taqwa (of which he is a director), to the financing of </p><p>international terrorism.  We are asking the Nigerians to </p><p>accept (1) that this link exists and (2) that NASCO and its </p><p>Nigerian subsidiaries are  a source of funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S)  Although Nigerian Heads of State traditionally have </p><p>exercised significant informal executive authority, we\'re </p><p>uncertain what legal basis exists for either seizure or </p><p>imposition of trusteeship.  Obasanjo, already facing charges </p><p>that he abuses power, likely will not want to take on another </p><p>project that will give his opponents further basis for </p><p>arguing that he </p><p>(1) does not respect due process and democratic norms; </p><p>(2) lacks concern for the welfare of northern Nigeria; and </p><p>(3) jumps too high in response to U.S. demands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) Comment continued: Complicating this picture is the </p><p>fact that most of the formal and informal security elements </p><p>fall under the authority of Muslims.  Aliyu Mohammed is the </p><p>NSA; Lateef Kayode Are is the Director of State Security (and </p><p>acts as NSA when Mohammed leaves the country); and the </p><p>President\'s Chief of Staff is MG Abdullahi Mohammed (ret). </p><p>None of these individuals would be anxious to be known for </p><p>carrying our water on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) NASCO, Nigeria and the US: The Mission still has no </p><p>idea how much, if anything, the NASCO companies operating in </p><p>Nigeria contribute to the positive cashflow of entities </p><p>outside of Nigeria under Nasreddin control.  From the look of </p><p>NASCO\'s flagship facilities in Jos, there does not seem to </p><p>have been much invested there recently.  Also, NASCO is no </p><p>longer the beehive of activity it was several years ago.  It </p><p>probably suffers from some many of the ailments that afflict </p><p>the manufacturing and food-processing sectors in Nigeria. </p><p>But, to the best of our knowledge, it remains by far the </p><p>largest private-sector employer in Plateau State. Moreover, </p><p>many small farms and businesses depend on it for sustenance. </p><p>As we detailed in refs D&F, action that shuts NASCO down will </p><p>inflict collateral damage on the bilateral relationship.  If </p><p>NASCO\'s role in financing international terrorism turns out </p><p>to be minimal, the costs of that collateral damage could far </p><p>exceed the value of the target eliminated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) While the trusteeship option might keep NASCO open, we </p><p>know neither what the books would show nor whether the </p><p>trustee would exercise its fiduciary responsibilities </p><p>faithfully.  In other words, NASCO could already be in bad </p><p>shape, or the wrong choice of trustee could put it there.  If </p><p>NASCO goes under as the (apparent) result of being placed </p><p>under trusteeship, Nigerians will blame the GON and the USG. </p><p>For Obasanjo, who faces a tough re-election fight and is not </p><p>anxious to create new adversaries, the costs of complying </p><p>with our request will be immediately evident.  He wants to </p><p>keep Plateau State in his corner.  Obasanjo has complained </p><p>recently that the USG makes too many demands while giving too </p><p>little heed to Nigeria\'s concerns.  So, we will need to </p><p>deliver our request for a NASCO trusteeship from a level high </p><p>enough that Obasanjo will be forced to listen and to offer </p><p>evidence so strong that he will feel compelled to commit to </p><p>comply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Recommendation:  If placing NASCO under trusteeship is </p><p>a USG priority, the Secretary\'s June 21 call on Obasanjo is </p><p>the best opportunity to raise this issue.  Approaches at </p><p>other levels are unlikely to bear fruit.  Hearing directly </p><p>from Secretary Powell the explanation that, understanding the </p><p>potential economic and political repercussions, we are not </p><p>asking to close NASCO but for Nigeria to keep future profits </p><p>from failing into the wrong hands should help. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
