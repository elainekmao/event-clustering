Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p>======================== </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) After a several-week hiatus, Ambassador Jeter met with </p><p>President Obasanjo for a relaxed, Saturday afternoon tea at </p><p>the President\'s residence on June 30.  A very positive and </p><p>wide-ranging discussion ensued which included security </p><p>assistance (Operation Focus Relief and MPRI), law enforcement </p><p>issues (crime in Lagos, FATF, counter-narcotics and </p><p>extradition), the Delta, inter-communal violence in Nasarawa </p><p>State, Obasanjo\'s planned September travel to the U.S., new </p><p>leadership for the OAU and ECOWAS, AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter was accompanied to the meeting by </p><p>his Staff Assistant (notetaker).  The President\'s Principal </p><p>Secretary Stephen Oronsaye was also in attendance. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>36 STATES: THE GOOD, THE BAD. . . </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter began the discussion by noting that </p><p>he had just visited Sokoto and Kebbi State (Ref C and D). </p><p>The President noted that the Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji </p><p>Mohammed Aleiro, had recently been to see him, complaining </p><p>that he was losing control of the mallams (Islamic religious </p><p>leaders).  President Obasanjo, chuckling, recounted that he </p><p>had suggested that Governor Aleiro stop giving them money </p><p>while explaining to them that the President was coming to </p><p>visit, and the money had to be put toward projects.  The </p><p>excuse would be that the President wanted to commission as </p><p>many projects in Kebbi as he had in Sokoto.  "After my </p><p>visit," the President said he told the Governor, "just don\'t </p><p>resume giving them any." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  President Obasanjo, jovially noting that it was good </p><p>that the Ambassador was "getting out to visit Nigeria\'s </p><p>different regions," began to order the States he believed the </p><p>Ambassador should visit, based on his view of the quality of </p><p>State leadership.  The President listed, in descending order, </p><p>Katsina (Governor Yar\'adua), Kaduna (Governor Makarfi - "he\'s </p><p>a good boy"), Adamawa (Governor Haruna), Rivers (Governor </p><p>Odili), Cross Rivers (Governor Duke), Bauchi (Governor </p><p>Mu\'azu), Plateau (Governor Dariye), Oyo (Governor Adesina - </p><p>"Lam is the best of the AD governors"), and Benue (Governor </p><p>Akume). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Huffing, President Obasanjo then added that Delta </p><p>State (Governor Ibori) and Edo State (Governor Igbinedion) </p><p>were "the worst." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>Nasarawa Update </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter raised the recent communal violence </p><p>in Nasarawa, that reportedly had displaced tens of thousands </p><p>of people.  The President said he too had heard that 40,000 </p><p>people had been displaced as a result of inter-communal </p><p>violence (Ref B).  He further added that three police </p><p>officers had been killed, and three were missing.  President </p><p>Obasanjo said that if he were asked to explain the reasons </p><p>for the conflict, he would not be able to do so, except that </p><p>it was a very old conflict between a people who see </p><p>themselves as indigenous to the land (Jukun) and see the Tiv </p><p>as invaders.  The President further noted that the Tivs were </p><p>an aggressive people, who had the reputation of taking over </p><p>wherever they went.  Ambassador Jeter elicited a </p><p>knee-slapping laugh from the President when he rhetorically </p><p>noted that General Malu was a Tiv.  President Obasanjo </p><p>concluded by characterizing Nasarawa State Governor Adamu as </p><p>one who "behaves and talks maturely," and indicated that he </p><p>believed the inter-communal violence would be brought under </p><p>control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==== </p><p>AGOA </p><p>==== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter noted that he had met recently with </p><p>the Minister of Commerce, and had attended the Vice </p><p>President\'s opening of the Ministry\'s AGOA office on June 29. </p><p> Nigeria had not yet met all of the requirements of AGOA, </p><p>such as establishing a visa regime but there was clearly </p><p>interest and efforts being made to do so.  The President </p><p>stated that Minister Bello wanted to begin selling inputs to </p><p>countries that had already qualified under AGOA, and asked </p><p>the Ambassador if that was acceptable.  Ambassador Jeter said </p><p>that as far as he knew it was, but that it was also important </p><p>that Nigeria finish meeting the requirements to receive the </p><p>full benefits of AGOA.  The President agreed, and explained </p><p>that he had set an output target for goods under AGOA.  In </p><p>response to Minister Bello\'s request to sell inputs to </p><p>qualified countries, the President had agreed but had doubled </p><p>the target Minister Bello had to meet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>Security Assistance </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) TRUCKS:  The Ambassador informed the President that </p><p>cooperation between the Embassy and the Army on Operation </p><p>Focus Relief (OFR) had improved greatly in recent months, and </p><p>that 1 Battalion (Birnin-Kebbi), 20 Battalion (Serti) and 222 </p><p>Battalion (Ilorin) had been selected for OFR P3 training. </p><p>However, there were several issues that needed quick </p><p>attention and resolution.  Ambassador Jeter informed the </p><p>President that the trucks delivered to Nigeria during OFR P1 </p><p>had still not been sent to Sierra Leone, and that the two </p><p>"missing" trucks were still, in fact, missing.  A visibly </p><p>upset Obasanjo stated that he had wanted to deal personally </p><p>with the issue of the missing trucks, but that NSA Mohammed </p><p>had urged the President to allow him to resolve the issue. </p><p>Turning to his Principal Secretary, the President proceeded </p><p>to dictate a memo to the NSA.  His composition to the NSA </p><p>stated that he was upset that the issue had not been resolved </p><p>as promised, and demanded resolution and a report by July 4. </p><p>Turning to the Ambassador, President Obasanjo said that if </p><p>the NSA did not report resolution by July 4, he would deal </p><p>with the missing trucks personally.  The Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that unless all of the trucks from OFR P1 were </p><p>delivered to Sierra Leone, the U.S. could not send new trucks </p><p>for the units training in Phase 3.  The President agreed, </p><p>saying, "Naturally," and added that shipping the trucks was </p><p>easy to accomplish and would be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) FOB: The Ambassador raised the need for a decision on </p><p>a forward operating base (FOB) for OFR P3, and noted that the </p><p>Air Force Base in Abuja had been discussed for many months; </p><p>however, the Embassy had yet to receive a confirmation that </p><p>the Abuja base would be acceptable to the military.  The </p><p>President asked Oronsaye to make a note for him to raise the </p><p>issue with Minister of Defense Danjuma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) MPRI:  The Ambassador explained that the MPRI payment </p><p>had been made, but that it had come up short by approximately </p><p>USD 320,000.  The President asked if that was due to </p><p>fluctuating exchange rates, and waving his hand, said that it </p><p>would be resolved.  The more fundamental concern regarding </p><p>MPRI, the Ambassador said, was that counterparts had still </p><p>not been assigned for all of the team.  This could be a very </p><p>useful program for the Ministry and the military, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter emphasized, but not until real cooperation existed. </p><p>President Obasanjo firmly agreed that the program could be of </p><p>great benefit, but said, "I don\'t think our people understand </p><p>it well."  He noted that he had discussed the program with </p><p>members of the Services during a military retreat in Kaduna, </p><p>and it was clear from the questions that there was a lack of </p><p>understanding.  However, he would meet the week of July 2 </p><p>with the new Chief of Army Staff (Major General Ogomudia), </p><p>whom he described as "a man you can work with," unlike </p><p>Lieutenant General Malu who "had a chip on his shoulder" and </p><p>had "outgrown his shoes."  "Just don\'t worry," he told the </p><p>Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>DRUGS, THUGS AND LAUNDERING </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) FATF: Turning to law enforcement issues, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter raised the FATF finding, and noted that he wanted to </p><p>make sure the President was aware of the seriousness of the </p><p>issue to Nigeria\'s image.  A visibly consternated Obasanjo </p><p>said that the Minister of Justice had failed to act, and that </p><p>he had reprimanded an apologetic Bola Ige during a recent </p><p>Council of State meeting.  (NOTE:  After the meeting </p><p>concluded, Oronsaye reiterated to the Ambassador the level of </p><p>the President\'s frustration over the confusion and lack of </p><p>action by the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of </p><p>Finance.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) NDLEA SUPPLEMENTAL: Ambassador Jeter noted how </p><p>pleased we were with the cooperation we were experiencing </p><p>with the NDLEA.  However, the Ambassador also told the </p><p>President that the Embassy was concerned that the NDLEA had </p><p>only received 350m Naira in the supplemental budget, instead </p><p>of the requested 2.2b Naira.  It was clear, the Ambassador </p><p>noted, that the agency could not do its business without the </p><p>resources, and that the size of the expected supplemental </p><p>(2.2b Naira) had helped push Nigeria over the top during the </p><p>2000 annual narcotics certification process.  A surprised </p><p>Obasanjo, in reference to certification, said, "We\'re not </p><p>done?  We have to do it again?"  The Ambassador explained </p><p>that certification was an annual process.  The President </p><p>rolled his eyes, and said, "God must be God of Obasanjo. </p><p>After what I did last time (in reference to the renditions), </p><p>if the press had found out they would have torn me apart." </p><p>He then said that NDLEA would get more money, and asked, "If </p><p>I give them another 350 million --  Is that okay?"  The </p><p>Ambassador responded that the key was that NDLEA be able to </p><p>operate effectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) EXTRADITION: The Ambassador noted that, in terms of </p><p>counter-narcotics certification, the Embassy was working with </p><p>the Ministry of Justice and others to develop a workable </p><p>extradition process.  One piece would include training for </p><p>prosecutors, and perhaps some judges, to serve on an </p><p>extradition court.  However, Nigeria would have to create </p><p>such a court.  Ambassador Jeter asked if such a court could </p><p>be created.  President Obasanjo responded that he would </p><p>create it if allowed by the NDLEA enabling act.  However, he </p><p>said, Nigeria needed assistance in the form of training.  In </p><p>a dismissive response to a reference to AG Ige\'s and Chief </p><p>Judge Belgore\'s statements that such a court could be created </p><p>(Ref A), an animated Obasanjo said "Belgore is the most </p><p>corrupt judge in Nigeria.  I will have to be very careful </p><p>when I replace him in July." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) LAGOS CRIME: Ambassador Jeter said he recently had </p><p>seen Lagos State Governor Tinubu on the crime situation in </p><p>Lagos.  The situation had our people, and many other </p><p>diplomats in Lagos, very afraid.  There had been two </p><p>carjackings of Embassy vehicles, and one Nigerian police </p><p>escort had been killed.  President Obasanjo said he was aware </p><p>of the situation, and that it would be taken care of.  (NOTE: </p><p>The President implied that he had a solution in mind, but did </p><p>not reveal his plans.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>THE OIL BUSINESS </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) DELTA AND OIL:  The Ambassador noted that recent </p><p>events in the Delta had raised some concern, particularly the </p><p>hostage situation at the Exxon-Mobil Bonny Island facility </p><p>(Ref E).  The President said, "Leave it with me," implying </p><p>that he had some action in mind, but not giving any hint of </p><p>what it might be.  The Ambassador then raised the oil block </p><p>production sharing contracts (PSC) bidding process, and noted </p><p>that some of the companies had expressed concerns the process </p><p>seemed to have stalled.  The President stated that he did not </p><p>deal with commercial issues except to approve or disapprove a </p><p>recommended action.  Gruffly waving his hand, he told the </p><p>Ambassador that he too should not get involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>OAU, ECOWAS, AND DELE-COLE </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The President stated that Nigeria would support the </p><p>Namibian candidate, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab, in his </p><p>bid for Secretary General of the OAU.  Ambassador Jeter noted </p><p>that Ambassador Kouyate was also seeking the post.  President </p><p>Obasanjo said that Kouyate was a good man, but that before </p><p>Salim-Salim, all of the Secretary Generals had been from West </p><p>Africa and had been Francophone, so Nigeria was supporting a </p><p>candidate from southern Africa.  Turning to ECOWAS, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter said that he hoped a replacement for Kouyate </p><p>could be found who could match Kouyate\'s skills, drive and </p><p>stature.  Praising Kouyate, the President said that if he had </p><p>his way, Kouyate would stay on in his present post.  However, </p><p>he noted, Kouyate had decided to leave.  That being the case, </p><p>Obasanjo said that the Chairmanship should remain </p><p>Francophone, but that the Executive Secretary could be an </p><p>Anglophone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU)  Ambassador Jeter asked the President if he had </p><p>selected a replacement for Patrick Dele-Cole, the President\'s </p><p>former Special Advisor on International Affairs and Nigeria\'s </p><p>former Ambassador to Brazil (who was released during the </p><p>cabinet shake-up in early June).  The President said he had </p><p>not yet decided if he would replace Dele-Cole, but if he </p><p>decided to, the replacement would be Ad\'obe Obe.  Obasanjo </p><p>described Obe as relaxed, bright and forthcoming.  (COMMENT: </p><p>Obe presently serves as the President\'s Personal Assistant </p><p>and Speechwriter.  While lamenting the departure of </p><p>Dele-Cole, Embassy has a similar impression of Obe to that of </p><p>the President, and believes he will be accessible and a close </p><p>confidant.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>======================= </p><p>MESSAGES FOR WASHINGTON </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked the President if he had any </p><p>messages he wanted to convey to Washington.  President </p><p>Obasanjo said he had little to convey, except that he was </p><p>"really satisfied" with the state of the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  He then noted that he was anticipating an </p><p>invitation from President Bush to visit Houston in September, </p><p>where he expected to meet with former President Bush (the </p><p>Elder), host a meeting of "Nigerians in the Diaspora" and </p><p>speak at the Baker Institute.  The President also noted that </p><p>he planned to attend the Corporate Council on Africa Summit </p><p>in Philadelphia in September, and to speak at Johns Hopkins </p><p>on health care during that same trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>SAA FLIGHT ISSUES </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) SAA FLIGHT ISSUES: After the meeting with the </p><p>President concluded, Ambassador Jeter raised the high number </p><p>of turn-arounds on the South Africa Airways flight from Lagos </p><p>to New York with Oronsaye.  The Ambassador noted that the MOU </p><p>on INS presence at MMIA was presently being cleared through </p><p>the GON and that the Embassy was looking into INS training </p><p>for Nigerian Immigration.  In the meantime, however, there </p><p>was a clear need for additional NDLEA presence at the airport </p><p>to monitor the flight.  Ambassador Jeter strongly emphasized </p><p>the importance of the flight for Nigeria\'s image and any </p><p>future hope of a U.S. carrier establishing a direct flight </p><p>between the U.S. and Nigeria.  Oronsaye resolutely agreed, </p><p>thanked the Ambassador for informing him of the issues at </p><p>hand, and promised to inform the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) The Ambassador and President had not met since the </p><p>President\'s trip to Washington.  The intent of the meeting </p><p>was to catch up on various issues of mutual concern. </p><p>President Obasanjo was interested, friendly and animated, </p><p>particularly on security assistance.  However, we were </p><p>surprised by his continued lack of understanding of the </p><p>certification process, and his lack of detailed knowledge on </p><p>the conflict in Nasarawa State (Ref B and previous). </p><p>However, the President appeared engaged and cooperative on </p><p>nearly every issue.  Ambassador will meet with NSA Mohammed </p><p>on July 2 and raise a different set of issues following on </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s May visit to Washington (septel). </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
