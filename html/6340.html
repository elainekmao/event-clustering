<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELTN, EWWT, MOPS, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S TRANSPORT SECTOR DURING AND AFTER AN IRAQ </p><p>WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN-STATE/TREASURY EMAIL OF 12/4/02 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 AMMAN 6535 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  The GOJ paints a gloomy picture of predicted heavy </p><p>losses to the transport sector during hostilities in Iraq, </p><p>totaling over $44 million monthly as a result of higher </p><p>insurance charges and decreased business volumes.  Following </p><p>war, though, the consensus opinion is that the sector will </p><p>enjoy a boom, followed by sustained increases in business </p><p>over a 3-5 year period as Iraq\'s commercial sector re-opens </p><p>and a new Iraqi government starts to rebuild infrastructure. </p><p>A short, successful military campaign that opens the doors </p><p>for rebuilding Iraqi infrastructure and commerce will help </p><p>minimize the short-term economic and social pain in Jordan </p><p>from an Iraq war - pain that will be disproportionately felt </p><p>by Jordan\'s 13,000 truckers and by transport sector-dependent </p><p>local economies in the southern reaches of the kingdom, </p><p>notably Ma\'an and Aqaba.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COSTS OF WAR </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Transport Ministry officials have made gloomy </p><p>calculations for the costs to the transport sector and to </p><p>government revenues in the event of war in Iraq (ref a). </p><p>According to Transportation Ministry Secretary General Ala\'a </p><p>Batayneh, all elements of Jordanian transport - sea, air, and </p><p>land - will incur substantial monthly losses during a war. </p><p>Most of these costs will result from lost business as a </p><p>result of the area being declared a "war risk" zone for </p><p>insurance purposes.  Such a designation, Batayneh said, would </p><p>cause shipping lines to stop calling on Aqaba (with knock-on </p><p>effects on truckers) and would similarly sharply curtail air </p><p>traffic to and over Jordan, all because of increased </p><p>insurance costs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  In addition to insurance-related losses, Batayneh </p><p>said the GOJ expects all cargo traffic (both domestic exports </p><p>and transit traffic) to Iraq to cease once war starts, with </p><p>the expectation that the border will be closed and truckers </p><p>will in any event be unwilling to make the trip.  Such a loss </p><p>of traffic would, Batayneh said, force the GOJ to support </p><p>out-of-work truckers with a "social safety net" until </p><p>business could resume.  According to Batayneh, the total </p><p>MONTHLY cost to the sector would amount to $44.46 million, </p><p>while the total MONTHLY cost to the central government would </p><p>be at least $5.2 million, excluding additional social safety </p><p>net payments. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WAR IMPACT ON LAND TRANSPORT... </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Private sector contacts share this gloomy </p><p>assessment.  Mahmoud Zoubi, Chairman of the Association of </p><p>Owners of Transport Vehicles (which represents Jordan\'s </p><p>11,000 independent truckers), said wartime losses would </p><p>devastate the sector, putting most of his members out of work </p><p>and impacting the "90% of Jordan\'s population" that relies </p><p>directly or indirectly on transportation.  (According to </p><p>Zoubi, the best-case scenario for Jordan would be an Iraq </p><p>free of sanctions but still ruled by Saddam, who has </p><p>"benefited every Jordanian citizen.")  Representatives of </p><p>Jordan\'s largest trucking companies, however, are somewhat </p><p>less concerned.  Salim Naber of the Odeh Naber Transport </p><p>Company, which handles virtually all specialized and oversize </p><p>cargo to Iraq, told us that even during a war there is likely </p><p>to be enough business to keep truckers employed at current </p><p>levels, due to the need to transport humanitarian supplies </p><p>and still-pending OFF contract shipments to Iraq.  Similarly, </p><p>Mohanned Qudah, Director of the Jordan-Syria Land Transport </p><p>Company, said his business would be virtually unaffected by </p><p>war, though the increased availability of underemployed </p><p>private truckers would give him more opportunities to </p><p>subcontract for business between Damascus and Amman. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>...AND SEA </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Captain Mohammed Dalabieh of the Shipping Agents\' </p><p>Association said that inbound cargo was unlikely to be </p><p>severely affected by war risk designation and higher </p><p>insurance charges, as those charges would either be passed on </p><p>to end-users (Jordanian consumers or relief agencies) or </p><p>would be absorbed by the shippers to maintain relations with </p><p>Jordanian importers.  Exports, though, could be affected - </p><p>particularly phosphate and potash, where increased charges </p><p>would likely translate into higher per-ton charges for the </p><p>cargo (during the Afghan war, $4/ton was the increase).  Raw </p><p>materials like phosphate and potash, Dalabieh said, are </p><p>extremely price-sensitive, with increases of even 50 cents </p><p>hurting competitiveness.  Increased charges on the order of </p><p>$4 could make Jordanian phosphate uncompetitive and thus hurt </p><p>the Phosphate company\'s operations as long as war risk </p><p>designation remains in place.  (Note:  phosphates and potash </p><p>together represent Jordan\'s largest export sector, totaling </p><p>over $320 million in each of the last three years, or 25-30% </p><p>of total exports.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Local shipping operator Amin Kawar was more sanguine </p><p>- he does not believe import or export cargo will be affected </p><p>even during war.  He said both insurance companies and </p><p>shippers had a great deal of discretion in applying insurance </p><p>charges, and would likely absorb most of the increased costs </p><p>in the short term to maintain normal business.  He said QIZ </p><p>shipments would not be impacted, as there is excess capacity </p><p>for container export out of Aqaba, and since QIZ containers </p><p>are relatively high-value goods ($50,000 per 40-foot </p><p>container), even paying the estimated increased shipping </p><p>charges of $150 per container would not affect exporters\' </p><p>bottom line. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>POST-WAR BOOM IN AQABA... </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  While there are variations in opinion over damage to </p><p>the transport sector during combat operations, there is a </p><p>broad consensus on the likely "boom" in the sector once the </p><p>war is over and Iraq opens its markets and begins to rebuild </p><p>its infrastructure, and aid agencies continue to care for </p><p>displaced populations and to alleviate hunger and poverty in </p><p>Iraq proper.  Even Zoubi, whose constituents benefit most </p><p>from the current arrangement, would not discount the </p><p>opportunities after regime change. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  GOJ and private sector contacts attribute a number </p><p>of factors to the prospective boom:  First and foremost, </p><p>Aqaba will, they believe, once again become a "natural" port </p><p>for Iraq.  Iraqi ports, they believe, are underdeveloped </p><p>after 20  years of warfare and sanctions, and cannot possibly </p><p>handle the volume of imports expected to flood into the </p><p>country after the war.  Similarly, Mediterranean ports like </p><p>Lattakia, Tartus, and Beirut are relatively small, </p><p>inefficient ports that will be able to handle some, but by no </p><p>means all, of the import activity.  By contrast, Aqaba is a </p><p>relatively large, much more efficient port, that was built up </p><p>in the 1980\'s with the Iraq market in mind.  Aqaba also has </p><p>spare capacity both in its general cargo and container </p><p>terminals, so it should be able to handle a significant </p><p>increase in business.  And even after the initial boom, and </p><p>taking into account likely increased port activity in the </p><p>Gulf geared toward the Iraqi market, Aqaba should continue to </p><p>be a significant port for Iraq, particularly for high-value </p><p>and oversize cargo from Asia, owing to its efficiency and </p><p>reputation - a sort of "branding". </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>...AND TRUCKING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  This increase in port activity will by definition </p><p>lead to an increase in land transport opportunities.  An </p><p>initial boom followed by a sustained rise in transit cargo </p><p>activity should keep Jordan\'s land transport fleet of 13,000 </p><p>(11,000 independent plus 2,000 company-owned) fully occupied </p><p>for the foreseeable future.  Zoubi and Qudah both noted to us </p><p>that, prior to 1990, Jordan was handling 4 million tons of </p><p>transit cargo to Iraq annually, a number that fell to 500,000 </p><p>tons under sanctions.  With this as a baseline, the sector </p><p>should be well-employed. </p><p> </p><p>10. (c)  Indeed, the one worry here is that, in the short </p><p>term, there will not be enough trucks in Jordan to handle the </p><p>increased transport demand.  The initial boom, say private </p><p>sector contacts, is likely to outstrip the ability of </p><p>Jordan\'s aging trucking fleet to deliver humanitarian </p><p>supplies AND rebuilding materials AND normal commercial </p><p>cargo. The World Food Program, for instance, has been </p><p>shopping for contracts to supply 3,000 trucks just for its </p><p>projected operations following the war.  This is in addition </p><p>to what is expected to be "normal" business.  These worries </p><p>extend to the logistics side of import operations - while the </p><p>port has the spare capacity, some contacts are not confident </p><p>that the road and loading infrastructure in Aqaba can handle </p><p>the increased traffic (though the recent completion of a </p><p>secondary freight highway around the outskirts of Aqaba </p><p>should alleviate some of that strain).  This bottleneck will </p><p>likely slow delivery times in the short term, until truckers </p><p>adapt to the increased business volume by cutting down </p><p>delivery times and increasing the number of runs they make </p><p>each month. </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>COMMENT:  SHORT WAR = EARLY RECOVERY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>11.  (c)  The transport sector is a primary revenue generator </p><p>for Jordan\'s economy.  In addition to directly supporting </p><p>13,000 truckers and their families - most of them politically </p><p>conservative East Bank tribal types - the sector also </p><p>supports thousands of families in aviation, tourism, port </p><p>operations, and the like.  To the extent that war dampens </p><p>activity in the transport sector, it will not only make those </p><p>thousands worse off, it will have knock-on effects throughout </p><p>the economy.  Reduced exports could threaten jobs at the </p><p>potash mining company, for example, and pass-through </p><p>insurance charges on inbound cargo that affect retail prices </p><p>would effectively tax consumption.  This could have an </p><p>important impact on government revenue and ultimately </p><p>contribute to a downward spiral in economic activity. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (c)  Equally importantly, losses to the transport sector </p><p>would be felt disproportionately in different parts of the </p><p>country.  Transport and mining dominate the economies of the </p><p>southern cities of Ma\'an and Aqaba, for example.  They would </p><p>therefore feel the economic pain much more deeply - pain that </p><p>could compound already high social tensions and anger toward </p><p>the government that, in Ma\'an at least, has already led to </p><p>violent clashes (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>13.  (c)  The key to minimizing damage to Jordan\'s economy </p><p>and rejuvenating the sector will be a short, successful war </p><p>in Iraq that starts aid and commerce flowing into Baghdad and </p><p>allows the new Iraqi government to start contracting for </p><p>infrastructure supplies.  The losses from war should be </p><p>reversed in short order once commerce and rebuilding begin. </p><p>Whatever their feelings about the relative merits of Saddam </p><p>or USG policy, many Jordanians are at the point where they </p><p>simply want to put the uncertainty behind them.  As Salim </p><p>Naber told us, "if you\'re going to hit him, hit him hard and </p><p>get it over with." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
