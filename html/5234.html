<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL, IO, NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, IT, UN, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON REFORMING UNHRC, UPCOMING HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>EVENT UNDER EU PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 111 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  IN A JANUARY 13 COURTESY CALL, MFA UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS MARGHERITA BONIVER TOLD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CHARGE THAT ITALY SHARED THE U.S. CONCERN FOR REFORM OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00243  211355Z </p><p>UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (OTHER ISSUES SEPTEL).  THE GOI </p><p>WILL HOST A "MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS EVENT" LATER THIS YEAR IN ITS </p><p>CAPACITY AS EU PRESIDENT AND WOULD WELCOME SUGGESTIONS FOR </p><p>POSSIBLE U.S. INVITEES.  BONIVER HOPES TO MAKE A TRIP TO </p><p>WASHINGTON IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WHEN SHE WOULD LIKE TO MEET </p><p>DEPARTMENT COUNTERPARTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION/LIBYA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C)  CHARGE RAISED THE ISSUE OF LIBYA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP OF </p><p>THE UNHRC.  BONIVER NOTED SHE WOULD ATTEND THE OPENING </p><p>SESSION AND THAT ITALY WOULD SEEK TO REGAIN ITS MEMBERSHIP ON </p><p>THE COMMISSION.  THE UNHRC NEEDS "PROFOUND REFORM," SHE </p><p>ASSERTED.  REVIEWING UPCOMING RESOLUTIONS, SHE FOUND SEVERAL </p><p>ON AFRICAN COUNTRIES, FIVE AGAINST ISRAEL/PRO-PALESTINIAN, </p><p>AND NOTHING ON CUBA.  "THAT\'S GROTESQUE," SHE EXCLAIMED. </p><p>"WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS KIND OF COMMISSION?  WHERE IS THE </p><p>BALANCE?"  CHARGE NOTED THAT REFORM WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE UNDER </p><p>A LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP.  IT WAS EQUALLY GROTESQUE, HE </p><p>REJOINED, TO HAVE A COUNTRY UNDER EVEN SUSPENDED UN SANCTIONS </p><p>CHAIRING THE COMMISSION.  BONIVER\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, </p><p>ALESSANDOR DI FRANCO (ALSO IN THE MEETING), CONFIRMED WITH </p><p>CHARGE THAT THE U.S. WOULD ASK FOR A VOTE ON LIBYA AS CHAIR </p><p>AND PREDICTED A SPLIT EU VOTE.  BOTH BONIVER AND CHARGE </p><p>AGREED ON THE DESIRABILITY OF REFORMING THE UNHRC, BUT THAT </p><p>THIS WAS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>GOI TO HOST HUMAN RIGHTS EVENT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00243  211355Z </p><p>3.  (U)  BONIVER SAID ITALY, AS EU PRESIDENT, WOULD HOST A </p><p>MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS EVENT IN MILAN IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER. </p><p>THE THEME WOULD BE SEEKING TO BRIDGE THE CULTURAL DIVIDE </p><p>BETWEEN ISLAM AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES BY FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>UNIVERSAL VALUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE </p><p>MOSTLY NGOS, FORMER NOBEL PEACE PRIZE RECIPIENTS, "PEOPLE WHO </p><p>CAN TALK ACROSS THE CULTURAL DIVIDE."  BONIVER ENCOURAGED </p><p>SUGGESTIONS FOR POSSIBLE U.S. INVITEES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  BONIVER HOPES TO MAKE A TRIP TO WASHINGTON IN THE </p><p>NEAR FUTURE (NO DATES PLANNED AT THIS TIME).  SHE WOULD BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN MEETING U/S DOBRIANSKY, U/S GROSSMAN, A/S </p><p>KELLY, AND A/S CRANER.  WE WILL ADVISE WHEN BONIVER INDICATES </p><p>THE TRIP IS IN THE PLANNING STAGES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00243 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
