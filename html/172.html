<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 20480 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANS SELL US STINGERS TO KHOMEINI </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE SUNDAY TIMES CARRIED A STORY ON SEPTEMBER 20 </p><p>ALLEGING THAT THE U.S. HAS CUT OFF SUPPLIES OF STINGER </p><p>MISSILES TO THE AFGHAN MUJAHEDEEN BECAUSE SOME OF THE </p><p>REBEL COMMANDERS HAD SOLD STINGERS TO THE IRANIANS FOR </p><p>MONEY AND POLITICAL FAVOR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANS SELL US STINGERS TO KHOMEINI </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAS CUT OFF SUPPLIES OF STINGER </p><p>ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES TO AN AFGHAN GUERRILLA GROUP </p><p>AFTER DISCOVERING THAT AT LEAST 16 OF THE WEAPONS WERE </p><p>SOLD BY THE RESISTANCE TO IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER MUJAHEDDIN LEADERS EMBARRASSED BY THE REVELATION, </p><p>SAID THAT AS A RESULT RESISTANCE TO THE SOVIET-BACKED </p><p>AFGHAN REGIME HAD COLLAPSED IN WESTERN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE STINGER, WHICH IS SHOULDER-FIRED AND SIMPLE TO USE, </p><p>IS CONSIDERED BY MILITARY EXPERTS TO HAVE TIPPED THE </p><p>BALANCE OF THE EIGHT-YEAR WAR IN THE MUJAHADDIN\'S </p><p>FAVOUR.  THE UNITED STATES STARTED TO DELIVER LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF STINGERS TO AFGHAN REBEL GROUPS LAST YEAR, </p><p>AND THIS LED TO HEAVY LOSSES AMONG AFGHAN AND SOVIET </p><p>HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>TWO COMMANDERS FROM THE HEZBI ISLAMI PARTY OF YOUNIS </p><p>KHALIS, ONE OF THE STRONGEST OF THE SEVEN GUERRILLA </p><p>GROUPS, ARE IMPLICATED IN THE SALE.  IT APPARENTLY </p><p>EARNED THEM 10M TOUMANS (ONE MILLION DOLLARS) AND </p><p>IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE REGIME OF AYATOLLAH </p><p>KHOMEINI.  THE GROUP IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTALIST FACTION </p><p>AMONG THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE AND MAINTAINS </p><p>REPRESENTATION IN TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE COMMANDERS WHO ARE SAID TO HAVE SOLD THE MISSILES, </p><p>MULLAH MAHIULLAH OF NIMROOZ AND MULLAH FAQIR-AHMAD OF </p><p>ANAR DARA, WHO CONTROLS THE KHASH RUD DISTRICT, WERE </p><p>SUPPLIED WITH 36 MISSILES.  THEY DENY HAVING SOLD THE </p><p>WEAPONS AND INSTEAD CLAIM THAT THEY WERE CAPTURED BY </p><p>IRANIANS INSIDE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE RESULTING SHORTAGE OF STINGERS IN THE REGION HAS </p><p>PROVED DISASTROUS FOR THE MUJAHEDDIN.  "NINETY NINE </p><p>PERCENT OF NIMROOZ WAS IN COMMUNIST HANDS," SAID AN </p><p>OBSERVER IN THE PAKISTAN BORDER TOWN OF QUETTA.  "ONLY </p><p>KHASH RUD WAS LEFT.  ALL SUPPLIES TO HERAT HAD TO GO </p><p>THROUGH KHASH RUD, SO IT WAS VITAL TO KEEP THE WAY </p><p>OPEN.  NOW KHASH RUD HAS BEEN BOMBED FLAT AND </p><p>RESISTANCE HAS VIRTUALLY CEASED THERE." </p><p> </p><p>WESTERN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN CONSIDERED RISKY FOR THE </p><p>US BECAUSE THE AREA MAINTAINS CLOSE HISTORICAL AND </p><p>ETHNIC LINKS WITH NEIGHBOURING IRAN.  MOST OF THE </p><p>AFGHAN SHI\'ITE POPULATION LIVE THERE.  "COMMANDERS COME </p><p>TO PAKISTAN AND SWEAR ON THE KORAN THAT THEY HAVE NO </p><p>LINKS WITH KHOMEINI.  THEN THEY GO AND SELL WEAPONS. </p><p>WHAT CAN YOU DO?" ASKED ON OBSERVER.  "MULLAHS HAVE NO </p><p>SENSE OF NATIONALITY," HE ADDED.  "ANY MUSLIM COUNTRY </p><p>IS THEIR HOME AND THEY CONSIDER IRAN TO BE WAGING JIHAD </p><p>(HOLY WAR) AGAINST IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>MANY LOCAL COMMANDERS ARE BITTER ABOUT THE SALE OF </p><p>STINGERS.  ONLY FOUR COMMANDERS IN THE KANDAHAR AREA, </p><p>AND THREE IN NIMROOZ, ARE KNOWN TO HAVE THE MISSILES. </p><p>EVEN POWERFUL LOCAL COMMANDERS, SUCH AS ABDUL RAZIQ OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING THE </p><p>WEAPONS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH PAKISTAN. </p><p>UNCOMFIRMED REPORTS EARLIER THIS YEAR MAINTAINED THAT </p><p>THE IRANIANS HAD USED STINGERS TO SHOOT DOWN IRAQI </p><p>AIRCRAFT IN THE GULF WAR.  THE US, WHICH DENIED THESE </p><p>REPORTS, IS CONCERNED THAT THE WEAPONS WILL FALL INTO </p><p>TERRORIST HANDS, OR WILL BE COPIED AND SUPPLIED IN </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS TO OTHER HOSTILE STATES SUCH AS LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE FLAT COUNTRY SURROUNDING KANDAHAR, WHICH HAS </p><p>BEEN A MUJAHEDDIN STRONGHOLD, THE NEED FOR </p><p>ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IS ACUTE.  THE GUERRILLAS TRAVEL </p><p>BY TRUCK ALONG DUST TRACKS AND ARE EASILY SPOTTED BY </p><p>OBSERVATION PLANES FITTED WITH NIGHT-SENSING </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  COMMANDERS AND JOURNALISTS VENTURING TO THE </p><p>WEST HAVE OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES THE TARGET OF AN </p><p>ORGANISED HUNT.  I ENCOUNTERED FIVE AMBUSHES IN THE </p><p>REGION DURING A THREE-WEEK TRIP.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  KABUL - MINIMIZE CONSIDER. </p><p> </p><p>PRICE </p><p></p></div>
