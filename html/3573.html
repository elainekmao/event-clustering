<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004820 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Jordanian Youth and the Future of Jordan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The following cable was drafted by an FSN member of </p><p>the Embassy staff.  We thought it was particularly </p><p>interesting as a description of the youth scene from the </p><p>inside. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Frustrated and insecure about the future and the </p><p>prevailing social and economic situation, Jordanian youth </p><p>are now willing more than ever to consider leaving the </p><p>kingdom for better opportunities elsewhere. Many young </p><p>Jordanians, especially those who have had the chance for a </p><p>U.S. or other Western education, feel hampered by limited </p><p>job opportunities, constrained free expression, societal </p><p>pressures, familial expectations and tribal ties. On the one </p><p>hand, the society lives by conservative traditional </p><p>standards, and on the other hand Jordan is changing and </p><p>globalizing so rapidly that many young people find </p><p>themselves in between conflicting worlds. A sense of </p><p>alienation drives some to look outside the Kingdom\'s </p><p>borders.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>The Familiar Complaints of Youth </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Jordanian youth across the board feel frustrated. </p><p>For some, this frustration centers on a sense that they are </p><p>victims of discrimination, favoritism and abuse of power by </p><p>a "wasta" connected elite. They don\'t like how society is </p><p>run, but feel powerless to change the situation. A second, </p><p>more diffuse complaint focuses on the cultural constraints </p><p>that prevent them from living their lives as freely as they </p><p>would like, or feeling that they control their own destiny. </p><p>Siham, a university student, is typical. She says she wanted </p><p>to study art, but was not allowed because her family thought </p><p>it\'s inappropriate and dishonorable for a girl to go into </p><p>such a field. Siham now studies Law instead because this is </p><p>what her parents want her to do. Like young people </p><p>elsewhere, Jordanian youth struggle to express themselves. </p><p>There is an inner conflict between wanting to be </p><p>individualistic and being bound to live in the shadows of </p><p>the family, tribe and community. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Buffeted by the Political Winds </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Living in the Middle East, Jordanian youth cannot </p><p>help but be caught up in the dual crises on the country\'s </p><p>borders: Israeli-Palestinian violence to the west, and the </p><p>seemingly never-ending problems in Iraq to the east. Roughly </p><p>half of the population is of Palestinian origin, many with </p><p>families still living in the West Bank, so emotional support </p><p>for the plight of the Palestinians is intense.  Furthermore, </p><p>many young Jordanians are willing to overlook what they </p><p>recognize as Saddam\'s brutal nature, and instead see in him </p><p>a strong Arab leader, a latter-day Salahaddin, who will </p><p>reclaim Arab honor. In a youth culture bereft of credible </p><p>leaders, the thirst for an authentic Arab hero - even one as </p><p>flawed as Saddam -- is strong.  What happens in the West </p><p>Bank and Iraq quickly reverberates in Jordan. Political </p><p>consciousness peaks during times of intense violence across </p><p>the river, and ebbs when relative quiet returns.  Similarly, </p><p>many feel disappointment with their own government for </p><p>prohibiting them from protesting as publicly, or as loudly, </p><p>as they would like. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The Economic Factor and Wasta </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Popularly-held estimates of unemployment in Jordan </p><p>run as high as 35% -- although official figures are less </p><p>than half that.  So-called underemployment of people working </p><p>less than full-time or in jobs beneath their qualifications </p><p>is probably substantially higher.  The current population </p><p>numbers nearly 5 million, with more than 75 percent under </p><p>the age of 30. As such, Jordan faces the challenge of </p><p>placing 130,000 students into universities and 70,000 new </p><p>entrances into the already squeezed labor market each year. </p><p>University entrance is difficult even with good grades </p><p>because of the limited number of seats. There are certain </p><p>quotas or number of seats given to family members of the </p><p>armed forces and Royal Court. For example, a Jordanian </p><p>student whose father was in the army can get a seat even if </p><p>he/she didn\'t fare better than another student. All </p><p>recognize that if you have "wasta" (connections), the rules </p><p>can be bent in your favor, and opportunities for advancement </p><p>will be far greater.   Young Jordanians without wasta fear </p><p>not only that they can\'t compete for well paying jobs, but </p><p>that they aren\'t competitive for any jobs at all. Pessimism </p><p>and frustration push some to seek better job opportunities </p><p>abroad. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>The Brain Drain and Differences Between </p><p>The Haves and The Have Nots </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) Youth who choose to leave, do so for two main </p><p>reasons: (1) to make money or (2) to seek greater freedom, </p><p>challenge, and adventure. Many upper middle class Jordanian </p><p>Youth are finding the Kingdom too small for big </p><p>opportunities, the ceiling for personal expression and </p><p>freedom too low, and the regional political situation too </p><p>unstable. While the government has pursued a "Think Big" </p><p>campaign to motivate the country for success, many Jordanian </p><p>youth are thinking bigger than what is available here. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) For instance, many upper middle class youth have </p><p>the resources to start businesses in Jordan but are afraid </p><p>of the future and anxious about putting their life savings </p><p>into a country that they perceive as caught in the middle of </p><p>an unending regional crisis. They would like to stay in </p><p>Jordan and realize their ambitions and aspirations here. </p><p>That said, many focus not on the opportunities that could </p><p>exist, but on the shortcomings they see around them, be it </p><p>in education, work and employment, health, leisure, access </p><p>to information, freedom of movement - no matter how </p><p>comfortably they live. They complain about the hike in </p><p>general taxes, but that doesn\'t stop them from buying; they </p><p>complain about the levels of education, but at least they </p><p>can afford to go to schools and colleges; they complain </p><p>about not finding good challenging jobs, but they won\'t </p><p>starve if they don\'t work. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Lower class youth share many of the same concerns </p><p>as their wealthier counterparts, but without the financial </p><p>safety net. Jobs are harder to find and when found are </p><p>underpaid. The father\'s income is no longer sufficient to </p><p>feed and educate the entire family. Youth are under economic </p><p>pressure and complain that the government is not doing </p><p>enough to better their situation. Life is a constant </p><p>struggle for them and they live day to day and can not </p><p>afford to plan ahead or dream too far. For 19-year-old </p><p>Ghassan, making a living is a struggle. He spends 16 hours a </p><p>day collecting fares on a bus in Amman and gets paid 6 </p><p>Dinars a day. He says it is hardly enough to support his 6- </p><p>member family. Ghassan is one of many youths forced to drop </p><p>out of school to join the labor market. Professor Shteiwi, a </p><p>sociologist at the University of Jordan, says that young </p><p>Jordanians have the will to develop themselves but not the </p><p>opportunities, while "the government still lacks a clear </p><p>vision to understand the basic needs for social and economic </p><p>development." </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The growing gap between the rich and poor youth is </p><p>a cause for concern.  Upper class Jordanian youth have their </p><p>education and work secured for them. They have access to </p><p>information and are well rounded. They can afford to travel, </p><p>and usually speak more than one language - this helps them </p><p>integrate into the larger world around them. They have the </p><p>know-how and positive attitude that enables them to </p><p>challenge convention, and they are thus more able as young </p><p>adults to demand their rights. They also have the means to </p><p>"vote with their feet" and seek opportunities elsewhere if </p><p>they feel unfulfilled here. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) For those with less financial means or wasta </p><p>connections, life is often a struggle from the outset: to </p><p>enter Universities, to study what they want and later to </p><p>have access and acceptance into the very competitive labor </p><p>market. They have more limited access to information, and </p><p>are not encouraged to grow and to challenge the status quo. </p><p>Society assigns them the role they can play, and this can </p><p>lead to stagnation and depression. Resentment toward their </p><p>richer counterparts grows, and frustration becomes a central </p><p>drive. These youths end up propagating the cycle with their </p><p>children.  They don\'t push them to achieve and to challenge </p><p>because they know the limits. </p><p> </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
