<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000352 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE </p><p>AGRICULTURE FOR FAS - U/S PENN AND EC - CHAMBLISS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IZ, PREL, TU, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN TRADE CLAIMS TUZMEN\'S VISIT TO IRAQ </p><p>GENERATED 700 MILLION EURO IN CONTRACTS FOR TURKISH FIRMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 262 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 302 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 8863 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Econoff met with Tevfik Mengu, Director General for </p><p>Agreements at the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat, on January </p><p>14 for a readout on State Minister Kursad Tuzmen\'s January 10 </p><p>to 12 visit to Baghdad.  Mengu characterized the visit as </p><p>very successful, noting that, in addition to Tuzmen\'s </p><p>one-on-one meeting with Saddam Hussein, the delegation, which </p><p>included Energy Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Nermin Berki </p><p>and an MFA official, had met with ten Iraqi ministers and the </p><p>Deputy Vice-President Taha Yasin Ramazan.  He asserted that </p><p>the 400 Turkish executives travelling with the delegation had </p><p>closed about 700 million euro worth of contracts in a range </p><p>of industries.  While he did not go into detail, he guessed </p><p>that about one quarter of the contracts were in agriculture, </p><p>including some wheat exports.  He stated that the total value </p><p>of the contracts would not be known until companies sent the </p><p>contracts to the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat for </p><p>submission to the UN Oil for Food Program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a briefing for the press, Tuzmen said that the </p><p>two sides signed memoranda of understanding in the energy </p><p>sector (on Iraq-Turkey natural gas exports, the Gharraf Field </p><p>Oil development and oil exploration).  However, MFA energy </p><p>officials told us that the delegation discussed the existing </p><p>Turkey-Iraq Gas Protocol (ref C), but no new agreements </p><p>resulted from the meetings.  Tuzmen also told the press that </p><p>a Turkey-Iraq Joint Economic Commission meeting would be held </p><p>in March in Ankara.  Mengu noted that no date for the JEC had </p><p>been set. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Tuzmen has said he used the visit to deliver a </p><p>political message to Saddam Hussein from PM Gul.  MFA </p><p>Undersecretary Ziyal told the Ambassador that Tuzmen had </p><p>delivered a strong message that the onus was on Saddam to </p><p>avoid war in the region by disclosing information on weapons </p><p>of mass destruction (ref B).  However, the substance of </p><p>Tuzmen\'s visit was overwhelmingly commercial, and has come </p><p>under criticism from Ak party colleagues, the political </p><p>opposition and the press.  Emin Sirin, the Deputy Chairman of </p><p>Parliament\'s Foreign Policy Committee, strongly criticized </p><p>the visit on January 6 (ref A).  In private conversations </p><p>with Polmilcouns on the margins of bilateral military talks </p><p>on January 13, a number of Turkish general officers roundly </p><p>criticized the Tuzmen visit as ill-timed and </p><p>counterproductive to Turkey\'s longer-term interests.  The </p><p>press has widely cited Tuzmen\'s joint press conference with </p><p>Deputy Vice President Ramazan, which Ramazan apparently cut </p><p>short on being asked a question about Turkish claims to Mosul </p><p>and Kirkuk.  Numerous articles have questioned Tuzmen\'s and </p><p>the GOT\'s judgement in leading such a large delegation to </p><p>Iraq at this time.  Republican People\'s Party (CHP) Chairman </p><p>Deniz Baykal said that Turkey had been humiliated and </p><p>subjected to rude behavior, and that the visit was </p><p>"meaningless, untimely and unnecessary". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  On Iraq matters, Tuzmen and Turkey\'s Foreign </p><p>Trade bureaucracy appear to be oblivious to anything beyond </p><p>short-term commercial gain.  However, domestic criticism of </p><p>Tuzmen\'s trade mission suggests that many view Tuzmen and his </p><p>visit as out of step with Turkey\'s larger interests.  In our </p><p>meetings with GOT officials, we have pointed out that, </p><p>because of its heavy commercial tone, this visit sent a </p><p>decidedly mixed message to Saddam. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
