REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02322  01 OF 03  021703Z </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 2239 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A JULY 31 LUNCH HOSTED BY CHARGE HOOKS, MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAID HE WAS PLEASED WITH </p><p>THE USG\'S APPROACH TOWARD ZIMBABWE AND WITH HIS RECEPTION BY U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  HE EXPECTS ZANU- </p><p>PF TO INTENSIFY THE VIOLENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT INSISTS THE MDC WOULD NOT RESPOND IN </p><p>KIND.  THE MDC PRESIDENT SAID HIS PARTY IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE </p><p>IMMUNITY TO PRESIDENT MUGABE IF HE STEPS DOWN, BUT MUGABE DOES NOT </p><p>TRUST THE MDC TO HONOR SUCH AN OFFER.  TSVANGIRAI BELIEVES THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL TAKE PLACE BECAUSE MUGABE NEEDS THAT </p><p>STAMP OF LEGITIMACY.  BASED ON EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS, THE MDC LEADER IS CONVINCED THAT THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES WILL NOT INTERVENE TO KEEP MUGABE IN POWER SHOULD </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNITED STATES COULD BE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE BY REMAINING ENGAGED ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE, COORDINATING ITS APPROACH WITH KEY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND BY PROVIDING ELECTION OBSERVERS AND </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CHARGE HOSTED MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOR LUNCH AT HIS RESIDENCE ON JULY 31. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MDC DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL GIFT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CHIMANIKIRE, WHILE THE CHARGE WAS JOINED BY THE DCM AND POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02322  01 OF 03  021703Z </p><p>WASHINGTON VISIT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTON, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID IT HAD BEEN "VERY PRODUCTIVE."  DURING THE COURSE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF HIS MEETINGS WITH USG OFFICIALS -- INCLUDING DEPUTY SECRETARY </p><p>ARMITAGE, A/S KANSTEINER, AND USAID ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS -- </p><p>TSVANGIRAI HAD NOTED A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD ZIMBABWE AND A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MDC AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI PRAISED A/S KANSTEINER\'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, PARTICULARLY OF THE POTENTIAL FOR BREAKDOWN HERE. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE CHARGE INQUIRED WHETHER TSVANGIRAI ANTICIPATED AN </p><p>INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.   THE MDC PRESIDENT REPLIED THAT HE HAS NO DOUBT THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF WILL INTENSIFY ITS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS, AS THIS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF </p><p>THEIR STRATEGY FOR WINNING AT ALL COSTS.  THE JULY 28-29 BY- </p><p>ELECTION IN BINDURA (SEPTEL) HAD CONFIRMED THAT EXPECTATION, AS </p><p>THE RULING PARTY HAD BUSED IN VOTERS FROM OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY, ESTABLISHED BASE CAMPS USED BY WAR VETERANS AND </p><p>PARTY THUGS TO INTIMIDATE VILLAGERS, AND ASSIGNED 200 YOUTHS TO </p><p>EACH POLLING STATION TO INTIMIDATE VOTERS.  ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>RULING PARTY COULD MOUNT SUCH AN EFFORT ON A NATIONAL SCALE, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID NO, AS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MANPOWER.   THE MDC, TSVANGIRAI REPORTED, IS CONSIDERING </p><p>BOYCOTTING FUTURE BY-ELECTIONS UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET </p><p>THAT WILL INCREASE THE PROSPECTS FOR A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02322  01 OF 03  021703Z </p><p>RECALLING THE ATTACK ON THE MDC PRESIDENT\'S CONVOY IN BINDURA </p><p>(REFTEL), THE CHARGE ASKED WHETHER TSVANGIRAI FELT THREATENED.  IF </p><p>HIS CONVOY HAD INCLUDED ONLY A COUPLE OF CARS, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, </p><p>HE AND THE OTHER OCCUPANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN "PULVERIZED" AND HE </p><p>MIGHT HAVE LOST HIS LIFE.  THAT SAID, THE MDC WAS DOING EVERYTHING </p><p>POSSIBLE TO MINIMIZE RISK BUT REALIZED THAT IT CANNOT ELIMINATE </p><p>IT.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT FEEL THAT HIS LIFE WAS </p><p>CONSTANTLY IN DANGER, DESCRIBING THE BINDURA INCIDENT AS A "ONE- </p><p>OFF" ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE CHARGE ASKED WHAT THE MDC\'S STRATEGY IS FOR DEALING </p><p>WITH ZANU-PF\'S TACTICS.  WE WILL NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI INSISTED.  THE MDC\'S STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO REDUCE ITS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS\' EXPOSURE BY NOT HOLDING LARGE RALLIES IN HOTSPOTS AND </p><p>BY QUIETLY EDUCATING PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO REFRAIN FROM VIOLENCE </p><p>AND TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES, INCLUDING </p><p>ATTENDING ZANU-PF RALLIES IF NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>DISILLUSIONMENT WITH ZANU-PF </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN THE TWENTY-ONE YEARS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, ZANU-PF HAS </p><p>DOMINATED ELECTORAL POLITICS AND BEEN ABLE TO WIN ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6717 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02322  02 OF 03  021704Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /005W </p><p>                  ------------------0D4449  021704Z /45 </p><p>P 021314Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9407 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 08/01/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, MOPS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPOSITION LEADER TSVANGIRAI ON UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>EASILY, THE CHARGE NOTED.  WHAT HAS CHANGED THAT DYNAMIC? </p><p>PRIMARILY THE DETERIORATION OF THE ECONOMY, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02322  02 OF 03  021704Z </p><p>WHICH HAS LED TO A RISING DISILLUSIONMENT WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THE YOUTH IN PARTICULAR ARE DISAFFECTED WITH MUGABE </p><p>AND WILL NOT GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.  THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR </p><p>THE PRESIDENT, TSVANGIRAI POINTED OUT, BECAUSE SIXTY PERCENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S POPULATION IS UNDER THE AGE OF 40. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TSVANGIRAI DECLARED THAT ZANU-PF IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>DISINTEGRATING, AND THAT THAT PROCESS WOULD BE COMPLETE ONCE </p><p>MUGABE GOES.  MUGABE, HE SAID, HAS PREVENTED THE REFORMERS, THOSE </p><p>CAPABLE OF DEVELOPING A NATIONAL FOLLOWING, FROM ADVANCING WITHIN </p><p>THE PARTY.  THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE IN ZANU-PF, HE SAID, AND FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI IS PROBABLY THE MOST QUALIFIED OF THEM. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, TSVANGIRAI SAID, MAKONI HAD CHOSEN THE WRONG CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE\'S FUTURE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE CHARGE ASKED WHETHER MUGABE IS PREPARED TO STEP DOWN </p><p>UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE ONE FACTOR WHICH GIVES MUGABE </p><p>PAUSE, TSVANGIRAI SAID, IS THAT HE FEARS FOR HIS SECURITY SHOULD </p><p>HE LEAVE OFFICE.  ASKED WHETHER HE COULD BE OFFERED A GOLDEN </p><p>PARACHUTE, TSVANGIRAI ASSERTED THAT THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHO </p><p>OFFERED IT, AS MUGABE HAS "ALWAYS MISTRUSTED EVERYONE."  THE </p><p>CHARGE ASKED WHETHER THE MDC WOULD MAKE SUCH AN OFFER.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>STRESSED THAT HIS PARTY HAS MADE CLEAR IN A NUMBER OF PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS THAT IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN RETRIBUTION.  WE ARE MORE </p><p>INTERESTED, HE CONTINUED, IN REBUILDING THE COUNTRY THAN ON </p><p>PUNISHING INDIVIDUALS.  THE MDC, HE SAID, IS PREPARED TO LET </p><p>MUGABE RETIRE AND LIVE IN PEACE, BUT THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT </p><p>"DOESN\'T BELIEVE US." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02322  02 OF 03  021704Z </p><p>9.  (C) TSVANGIRAI REMARKED THAT MUGABE WANTS TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>TERMS FOR HIS OWN SUCCESSION, BUT THE TIME FOR HIM TO DO SO </p><p>UNILATERALLY IS LONG PAST.  ASKED WHOM MUGABE WOULD PREFER AS HIS </p><p>SUCCESSOR, TSVANGIRAI SAID WITHOUT HESITATION "IT\'S OBVIOUS, </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA [SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT AND ZANU-PF SECRETARY </p><p>FOR ADMINISTRATION]."  HE DISMISSED MNANGAGWA\'S ELECTORAL </p><p>PROSPECTS, HOWEVER, INSISTING THAT HE HAS NO POLITICAL FUTURE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE -- ONCE MUGABE GOES -- AND WOULD LOSE SOUNDLY TO THE MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  (COMMENT: MNANGAGWA LOST </p><p>HIS RUN FOR PARLIAMENT IN THE JUNE 2000 ELECTIONS, AS DID </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, ALTHOUGH TSVANGIRAI SUBSEQUENTLY WON A HIGH COURT CASE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OVERTURNING ZANU-PF\'S VICTORY IN HIS CONSTITUENCY.)  TSVANGIRAI EXPRESS </p><p>ED HIS BELIEF THAT MUGABE CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO HOLD THE ELECTION, WHICH </p><p> THE PRESIDENT SEES AS NECESSARY FOR HIS OWN E </p><p>XTERNAL LEGITIMACY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ASKED WHETHER THE RECENT LAW BANNING FOREIGN FUNDING OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES HAD PROVED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT HINDRANCE FOR THE </p><p>MDC, TSVANGIRAI SAID NO, THE LAW HAD BEEN MORE OF AN </p><p>INCONVENIENCE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT ZANU-PF IS ALSO RECEIVING </p><p>FUNDS FROM FOREIGN SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>GETTING ALONG WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) NOTING THAT TSVANGIRAI AND OTHER SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE HAD REGULAR CONTACTS WITH THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (COSATU), THE CHARGE </p><p>ASKED HOW THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES SAW THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTSWANA, MOZAMBIQUE, AND SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, ARE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE MDC\'S POSITION, WHILE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02322  02 OF 03  021704Z </p><p>ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA PREFERS TO SIDE WITH MUGABE GIVEN HIS </p><p>INTEREST IN PURSUING A THIRD TERM.  SOUTH AFRICA, HE CONTINUED, </p><p>CAN AFFORD TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ON DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE, BUT </p><p>IT IS TRYING TO FIND AN EFFECTIVE BALANCE BETWEEN ENGAGING MUGABE </p><p>AND ISOLATING HIM. </p><p> </p><p>ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE CHARGE ASKED HOW THE UNITED STATES COULD BEST HELP IN </p><p>INCREASING THE PROSPECTS FOR A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION AND BUILDING </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS IN ZIMBABWE.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>URGED THE UNITED STATES TO REMAIN ENGAGED AND TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>CONDEMN "UNDEMOCRATIC PRACTICES."  THE REMARKS BY SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>DURING HIS TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA HAD BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN </p><p>POSITIONING THE UNITED STATES ON THE SIDE OF THOSE HERE WHO ARE </p><p>PRESSING FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE.  HE ALSO ENCOURAGED THE U.S. TO </p><p>WORK CLOSELY WITH KEY AFRICAN LEADERS AND OTHER PARTNERS, SUCH AS </p><p>THE EU, TO ENSURE, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY SPEAKS WITH ONE VOICE ON ZIMBABWE.  HE ALSO ASKED FOR </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, SUCH AS CLEANING UP </p><p>THE VOTERS ROLL, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES SEND ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6718 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02322  03 OF 03  021705Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /005W </p><p>                  ------------------0D4454  021705Z /45 </p><p>P 021314Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9408 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 08/01/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, MOPS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPOSITION LEADER TSVANGIRAI ON UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THE CHARGE INFORMED TSVANGIRAI THAT THE UNITED STATES IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02322  03 OF 03  021705Z </p><p>PLANNING TO PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BEFORE AND DURING THE </p><p>ELECTION.  TSVANGIRAI WAS PLEASED WITH THAT NEWS AND STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF HAVING RESPECTED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE </p><p>REGULAR ASSESSMENTS BEGINNING WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE VOTING DAYS. </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE </p><p>REPORTS ISSUED BY EUROPEAN AND U.S. OBSERVERS LAST JUNE AND THOSE </p><p>PUBLISHED BY SADC OBSERVERS, TSVANGIRAI DISMISSED THE SADC REPORTS </p><p>AS TOO SOFT ON MUGABE.  HE REPORTED THAT ANC CHIEF WHIP TONY </p><p>YENGENI HAD TOLD HIM RECENTLY THAT HE NOW REALIZES SADC\'S </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE JUNE 2000 ELECTION WAS INACCURATE. </p><p> </p><p>ROLE OF THE MILITARY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) ASKED WHETHER MUGABE WOULD ALLOW THE MDC TO ASSUME POWER </p><p>IF IT WINS THE ELECTION, TSVANGIRAI SAID HE WOULD HAVE LITTLE </p><p>CHOICE, AS HE CANNOT RELY ON THE SECURITY SERVICES TO PROP HIM UP. </p><p>THE MDC PRESIDENT SAID HE IS CONFIDENT  -- BASED ON EXTENSIVE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE MILITARY -- THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL NOT </p><p>INTERVENE TO KEEP MUGABE IN POWER SHOULD THE MDC WIN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE THOUGHT THAT SOME UNITS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL GUARD, MIGHT TRY TO DO SO, BUT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY </p><p>OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WOULD ABIDE BY THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>ELECTION.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 1,000 ROGUE WAR </p><p>VETERANS ON WHOM MUGABE CAN DEPEND FOR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THE CHARGE ASKED TSVANGIRAI TO DESCRIBE THE MDC\'S POLICY </p><p>ON LAND.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02322  03 OF 03  021705Z </p><p>ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, TSVANGIRAI CONTENDED.  IMPLEMENTATION OF A </p><p>GENUINE LAND REFORM PROGRAM REQUIRES A PLAN AND RESOURCES, NEITHER </p><p>OF WHICH FEATURES IN THE GOZ\'S CURRENT CHAOTIC EFFORT.  AN </p><p>ESSENTIAL STARTING POINT, HE DECLARED, IS FOR THE NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THAT COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE IS VITAL </p><p>TO THE COUNTRY\'S WELL-BEING AND THAT SOCIAL EQUITY IS IMPORTANT. </p><p>IN ADDITION, FARMWORKERS ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF THE LABOR FORCE AND </p><p>MUST BE INCLUDED IN ANY SOLUTION TO THE LAND PROBLEM.  MANY OF </p><p>THEM ARE THIRD- OR FOURTH-GENERATION ZIMBABWEANS AND TREATING THEM </p><p>AS FOREIGNERS IS UNFAIR. </p><p> </p><p>MDC ON DRC </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) ASKED FOR HIS VIEWS ON THE DRC CONFLICT, TSVANGIRAI SAID </p><p>IT CANNOT BE RESOLVED MILITARILY, BUT WHETHER A POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>COULD BE ACHIEVED DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRESIDENT KABILA </p><p>ENGAGES HIS COMPATRIOTS.  ZIMBABWE, HE CONTINUED, HAS NO NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY INTERESTS AT STAKE IN THE DRC.  IF HE WINS THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HE WOULD ORDER THE WITHDRAWAL OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>TROOPS.  HE ADDED THAT THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS, IN A FASHION THAT WOULD NOT DESTABILIZE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE DRC. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) ALTHOUGH SOME OBSERVERS HAVE EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY (HIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ACADEMIC STUDIES DID NOT EXTEND BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL), HE IS </p><p>BRIGHT, ARTICULATE, THOUGHTFUL, AND WELL-INFORMED, AND WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02322  03 OF 03  021705Z </p><p>COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING A RANGE OF DIFFICULT ISSUES.  HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT BUT NOT ARROGANT AND SEEMED GENUINELY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT </p><p>HIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE PROSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) TSVANGIRAI\'S EFFORTS TO CULTIVATE THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP </p><p>ARE SMART POLITICS AND COULD PAY IMPORTANT DIVIDENDS DURING THE </p><p>ELECTION AND ITS AFTERMATH.  HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE </p><p>NEUTRALITY OF THE MILITARY, HOWEVER.  WE WERE IMPRESSED BY </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S FOCUS ON THE FUTURE RATHER THAN ON MUGABE\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SHORTCOMINGS, AND ARE ENCOURAGED THAT HE IS PREPARED TO LET THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT RETIRE IN PEACE WITHOUT SEEKING RETRIBUTION. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TSVANGIRAI IS A SHREWD POLITICIAN, </p><p>KEENLY AWARE OF THE NEED TO CULTIVATE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>AND HIS COMMENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THAT LIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
