<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, YE </p><p>SUBJECT: SALIH EXPRESSES CONDOLENCES FOR RIYADH BOMBINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASON 1.5 D </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On May 14, Deputy FM al-Radi called in the DCM to </p><p>deliver a condolence letter from ROYG President Salih to </p><p>President Bush for the 5/13 Riyadh bombings.  The letter </p><p>expresses condolences for the American victims\' families, </p><p>condemnation of the terror acts, and Yemen\'s commitment to </p><p>the war on terrorism. While delivering the letter, al-Radi </p><p>spoke about ROYG-US security cooperation, the US-Saudi </p><p>relationship, and the situation in Iraq since the return of </p><p>Shia leader Mohammed Bakir al-Hakim. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CONDOLENCE LETTER </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The DCM, accompanied by polecon chief, was convoked </p><p>on 5/14 by Abdullah Ali al-Radi, MFA Deputy Minister for </p><p>Arab, Asian and African Affairs, to receive a condolence </p><p>letter from ROYG President Ali Abdullah Salih to President </p><p>Bush.  The letter (text below in para 7) expresses emphatic </p><p>condemnation of the Riyadh bombings as terror acts </p><p>incompatible with all religious teachings and reaffirms </p><p>Salih\'s previous pledges of partnership with the US in </p><p>combating terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Al-Radi also expressed his own personal condolences. </p><p>The DCM briefed him on the methodology of the attacks, </p><p>stressing that security practices in Yemen and elsewhere must </p><p>adjust to counter the evolving tactics of the terrorists. </p><p>The DCM took the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding </p><p>cooperation the Embassy receives from ROYG security forces </p><p>protecting the Embassy, the Hadda compound (predominately </p><p>American and international residents), the Sheraton Hotel, </p><p>which hosts many American visitors, and Embassy residences. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES - SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Radi was curious about US-Saudi relations in the </p><p>aftermath of the attacks, given the tensions existing since </p><p>9/11. The DCM assured him that friendship and cooperation </p><p>between Saudi Arabia and the US have stood the test of many </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turning to Iraq, Al Radi asked for an update on the </p><p>security situation, especially since the return of Shia </p><p>leader Mohammed Bakir al-Hakim from Iran.  Will the US be </p><p>able to prevent a three-part ethnic breakup of the country? </p><p>The Coalition\'s prompt establishment of three administrative </p><p>divisions had provoked much speculation among Yemenis, he </p><p>said. The DCM reminded him of the U.S. Administration\'s firm </p><p>commitment to the territorial integrity of Iraq and </p><p>underscored U.S. determination to restore essential services </p><p>and help the Iraqi people build a better future. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Al Radi stretched the delivery of the condolence </p><p>letter into an hour\'s conversation on current events.  His </p><p>questions on Iraq\'s potential problems with Shia separatism </p><p>and Saudi Arabia\'s current unenviable position may have been </p><p>posed with the imminent arrival of Iranian President Khatami </p><p>in mind. Khatami\'s official visit began today, 5/15. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>TEXT OF SALIH CONDOLENCE LETTER </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Dear friend Mr. President George W. Bush, </p><p>President of the United States of America, Washington </p><p> </p><p>I was greatly moved and felt deep sorrow to receive the news </p><p>that a number of American citizens had fallen victim to the </p><p>distressing terrorist attack targeting several residential </p><p>compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p>As we express to you our emphatic condemnation of this </p><p>shameful terrorist act, I offer my sincere sympathy for the </p><p>victims who fell as a result of it and convey our deepest </p><p>condolences to the families of the victims and to the </p><p>friendly American people. </p><p> </p><p>Such terrorist acts, which are incompatible with all </p><p>religious teachings and proper humanitarian values, can only </p><p>heighten the determination of the international community to </p><p>move forward and redouble its efforts to combat and eradicate </p><p>terrorism and prevent the loss of innocent souls.  We affirm </p><p>to you that the Republic of Yemen, which rejects terrorism in </p><p>all its forms and aspects and from whatever source, will </p><p>remain an effective partner to your friendly country and to </p><p>the international community in combating terrorism and </p><p>confronting its perpetrators. </p><p>Please accept my highest regards. </p><p> </p><p>Signed: </p><p>Ali Abdullah Saleh </p><p>President of the Republic of Yemen </p><p> </p><p>Sana,a </p><p>Rabi,e Awal 13, 1424 </p><p>May 14, 2003 </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
