A) PRETORIA 1680 </p><p>     B. B) PRETORIA 2537 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNSELOR MDRAGSDALE, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ALONG WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE REFORM OF SADC\'S </p><p>ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (REF A), SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA IS A KEY PLAYER IN THE OVERALL REFORM OF SADC AS AN </p><p>INSTITUTION.  AS A MEMBER OF THE "TROIKA PLUS ONE" (SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, NAMIBIA, ZIMBABWE, AND MOZAMBIQUE) REFORM COMMITTEE, </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA HAS CONTINUED TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RESTRUCTURING OF SADC, IN LINE WITH THE 1999 SUMMIT </p><p>COMMUNIQUE.  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' </p><p>(DFA) DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC AFFAIRS AJ BRAMDEO, THE REVIEW </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHICH MET IN MID-MARCH, IS SCHEDULED TO MEET AGAIN </p><p>APRIL 12-14 IN MAPUTO.  IN A MARCH 27 MEETING, BRAMDEO TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO BE SENDING A DELEGATION </p><p>IN APRIL TO VISIT VARIOUS REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS </p><p>MERCOSUR, CARICOM, AND ECOWAS IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER </p><p>THEY COULD PROVIDE USEFUL GUIDANCE FOR SADC REFORM (COMMENT. </p><p>ON MARCH 31 BRAMDEO TOLD POLOFF THAT SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI AND MALI PRESIDENT KONARE DISCUSSED POSSIBLE </p><p>SADC-ECOWAS COOPERATION.  SEE REF B.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BRAMDEO, THE REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS </p><p>CREATED A "CLUSTER" APPROACH TO SADC, WHEREBY ALL THE </p><p>SECTORAL COORDINATING UNITS AND THE COMMISSIONS ON TRANSPORT </p><p>AND ENERGY WOULD BE COLLAPSED INTO 5 CLUSTERS, OVERSEEN BY </p><p>DIRECTORATES.  THESE DIRECTORATES, BRAMDEO TOLD POLOFF, WOULD </p><p>ALL BE LOCATED WITHIN THE SADC SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS NOT YET FINALIZED DETAILS </p><p>SUCH AS CALENDARIZATION OF THE PROCESS, POSITION DESCRIPTION </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES, BRAMDEO </p><p>AFFIRMED THAT IT ENVISIONS THE DIRECTORATES WOULD HAVE A </p><p>TOTAL STAFF OF APPROXIMATELY 50 PERSONS, ALL OF WHOM WOULD BE </p><p>FROM THE SADC REGION.  BRAMDEO STRESSED THAT THE COMMITTEE </p><p>SUPPORTS TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE COMPETITION FOR THESE </p><p>POSITIONS, WITH THE JOBS GOING TO THE MOST QUALIFIED </p><p>APPLICANTS, REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY.  BRAMEDO DID NOT RULE </p><p>OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING SADC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONORS TO FINANCE THESE CLUSTERS (AND </p><p>SALARIES).  THE CLUSTERS AND THEIR DIRECTORATES WOULD FOCUS </p><p>ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SADC "PRIORITIES" (AS DEFINED BY </p><p>THE COORDINATING UNITS), AND ON ESTABLISHING BENCHMARKS AND </p><p>TIMEFRAMES FOR PHASED-IN APPROACHES TO REGIONAL PROJECTS. </p><p>THIS WAY, SAID BRAMDEO, THE INSTITUTION WOULD BETTER BE ABLE </p><p>TO GAUGE ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND SUCCESSES AND FAILURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  RECOGNIZING THE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SENSITIVITIES </p><p>(ESPECIALLY FROM THE SMALLER SADC MEMBERS WHO STAND TO LOSE </p><p>THEIR SECTORAL COORDINATING ROLES), BRAMDEO INDICATED THAT </p><p>THE REVIEW COMMITTEE WAS PREPARED TO "LOBBY" FOR ITS REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM.  HE SAID THE ORGAN AND SOCIAL REFORM COMMITTEES </p><p>WOULD "MERGE" THEIR PROJECTS IN JUNE AND PRESENT THE COMBINED </p><p>RESTRUCTURE PROPOSAL AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, AFTER WHICH </p><p>LOBBYING EFFORTS WOULD BEGIN IN EARNEST. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ON AN ASIDE, BRAMDEO ADDED THAT THE REVIEW COMMITTEE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NEXT SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY POSSESS </p><p>WELL-DEFINED MANAGERIAL SKILLS AND MEET SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL </p><p>CRITERIA.  BRAMDEO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SADC </p><p>WOULD CHOOSE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR (SUCH AS A </p><p>RETIRED CEO) RATHER THAN SOMEONE FROM THE POLITICAL ARENA FOR </p><p>THE POSITION.  HE SAID THE HEADS OF STATE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY ISSUE DURING THE NEXT SADC </p><p>SUMMIT IN AUGUST 2000. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA CONTINUES TO WORK WITHIN THE SADC </p><p>SYSTEM IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO STRENGTHEN REGIONAL COOPERATION. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE REVIEW COMMITTEE\'S PROPOSALS SOUND AMBITIOUS, </p><p>THE LACK OF DETAIL ON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>REMUNERATION AND CALENDARIZATION INDICATES THAT THE FRUITION </p><p>OF ANY REFORM IS STILL A LONG TIME IN COMING.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LEWIS </p><p></p></div>
