CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  DURING TWO NATO POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS </p><p>MARCH 26 AND APRIL 2, ALLIES REVIEWED THE IMPLICATIONS OF </p><p>THE END OF THE WARSAW PACT AND NEW SOVIET RELATIONS WITH </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE.  THE DISCUSSION COVERED BOTH SOVIET AND </p><p>VARIOUS EASTERN EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TOWARDS THEIR NEW </p><p>SECURITY RELATIONS.  MOST SAW THE SOVIETS AS SEEKING TO </p><p>AVOID ISOLATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS FINDING IT </p><p>DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME THE ANIMOSITY OF THE PAST FORTY </p><p>YEARS.  ONE FOCUS OF DISCUSSION WAS THE NEW BILATERAL </p><p>TREATIES WHICH THE SOVIETS ARE NEGOTIATING WITH FORMER WTO </p><p>ALLIES.  THE FIRST SUCH TREATY WAS INITIALED WITH ROMANIA </p><p>AND ACCORDING TO THE GERMANS CONTAINS CLAUSES ABOUT NOT </p><p>JOINING ALLIANCES TO WHICH CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY HAVE </p><p>MADE CLEAR THEY ARE NOT GOING TO AGREE.  VARIOUS OTHER </p><p>BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS AMONG EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS </p><p>A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PACT WERE ALSO </p><p>DISCUSSED AND THE IMS GAVE THEIR ANALYSIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN TWO SUBSEQUENT POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS, ALLIES </p><p>DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF THE END OF THE WARSAW PACT </p><p>MILITARY STRUCTURES.  A NUMBER OF ALLIES FOUND THE FRENCH </p><p>PAPER ON THE SUBJECT (FAXED TO EUR/RPM) TO BE A GOOD </p><p>SUMMARY OF IMPLICATIONS FOR ARMS CONTROL AND EUROPEAN </p><p>RELATIONS IN GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>SOVIET VIEWS </p><p>------------ </p><p>4.  THE FRENCH REP SAID THAT IT WAS PREMATURE TO DRAW </p><p>ULTIMATE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE END OF THE </p><p>WARSAW PACT.  IT WAS CLEAR FROM BILATERAL CONTACTS WITH </p><p>THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHAT THEIR PREFERENCES WERE </p><p>TO REPLACE THE PACT IN THEIR SECURITY POLICIES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IT WAS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND MOSCOW\'S REACTION </p><p>AS WELL.  THE SOVIETS WERE AWARE OF THE DETERIORATION OF </p><p>THEIR BASIC RELATIONS WITH THEIR FORMER ALLIES.  BUT, THEY </p><p>ARE LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE REASONS FOR THAT CHANGE AS THEY </p><p>BELIEVED EASTERN EUROPE ACTUALLY SAW SOME SECURITY BENEFIT </p><p>FROM THE PACT AND TIES TO THE SOVIET UNION.  IN ANY CASE, </p><p>MOSCOW UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NEW BASIS FOR </p><p>RELATIONS WHICH MEANS A REJECTION OF THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE ISSUE FOR THE SOVIETS IS HOW TO DEVELOP THOSE </p><p>RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OWN POLITICAL DISARRAY. </p><p>THE SOVIET MILITARY IS INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO THE BLATANT </p><p>MANIFESTATIONS OF DISLIKE FROM THE FORMER WP ALLIES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN TEARING DOWN WAR </p><p>MONUMENTS AND OTHER REMINDERS OF SOVIET TROOP PRESENCE. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, SOME IN MOSCOW ARE AWARE THAT THE VERY </p><p>INSTABILITY OF THE SOVIET UNION TODAY IS PERCEIVED BY </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE AS A THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THIS LEAVES THE SOVIETS WITH TWO CHOICES:  LEAVE </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE TO THE WEST AN ACCEPT ISOLATION OR DEVELOP </p><p>NEW RELATIONS ON A MORE EQUAL BASIS.  OBVIOUSLY, THE </p><p>SOVIETS DESPITE THE ODDS, WILL GO FOR THE LATER SOLUTION. </p><p>THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME STEPS TO REDUCE </p><p>EASTERN EUROPEAN FEAR OF THE SOVIET UNION.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, MOSCOW WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT NATO SHOULD ALSO </p><p>DISAPPEAR AND, IN ANY CASE, EASTERN EUROPE SHOULD NOT </p><p>DEVELOP TOO CLOSE RELATIONS WITH IT.  THUS, THE SOVIETS </p><p>WILL SEEK BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH SOME NEGATIVE SECURITY </p><p>GUARANTEES AND, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, MAINTAIN SOME FORM OF </p><p>POLITICAL CONSULTATION WITH EASTERN EUROPE EITHER AS A </p><p>VESTIGE OF THE PACT OR MORE LIKELY UNDER SOME NEW FORMAT. </p><p>THE SOVIET MODEL REMAINS, AS EXPRESSED BY BESSMERTNYKH AT </p><p>THE MEETING OF THE PACT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ENDED </p><p>THE MILITARY STRUCTURE, TO DEVELOP RELATIONS WITH EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE AS NEUTRALS ALONG THE LINE OF AUSTRIA AND FINLAND. </p><p>THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SOVIETS IS </p><p>SELF-ISOLATION. </p><p> </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE\'S SEARCH FOR NEW SECURITY RELATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE NETHERLANDS REP NOTED THE PERCEPTION AMONG EASTERN </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OF A SECURITY VACUUM WITH THE DEMISE OF </p><p>THE PACT.  HE ARGUED THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF THE </p><p>PACT\'S END WILL BE EASTERN EUROPE\'S SEARCH FOR NEW </p><p>SECURITY STRUCTURES.  REVIEWING A DISCUSSION THE DUTCH </p><p>EMBASSY IN WARSAW HAD WITH POLISH FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIAL TOWPIK, THE DUTCH REP SAID THAT THERE WERE THREE </p><p>OPTIONS FOR EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES:  JOINING NATO, </p><p>NEUTRALITY, AND USING CSCE STRUCTURES.  IN HIS REVIEW OF </p><p>THESE OPTIONS, TOWPIK INDICATED THAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS </p><p>NONE WAS APPROPRIATE IN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO </p><p>THE SENSE OF VACUUM, THE POLES BELIEVED THEY SHARED WITH </p><p>CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY.  NATO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION HAD MADE CLEAR THAT IMMEDIATE MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>THE WESTERN ALLIANCE WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE NOW.  THE THREE </p><p>COUNTRIES REJECTED NEUTRALITY BECAUSE IT SUGGESTED A </p><p>BUFFER ZONE OR "CORDON SANITAIRE," WHICH WAS NO GUARANTEE </p><p>OF SECURITY, BUT RATHER A GREATER RISK.  FINALLY, CSCE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE </p><p>SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN THIS CONTEXT, THE POLES WOULD TRY TO DEVELOP </p><p>BILATERAL TIES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS INCLUDING GERMANY AND </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION.  BUT TOWPIK HAD NOTED TO HIS DUTCH </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS ALREADY SEEKING </p><p>CLAUSES IN ITS BILATERAL TREATY WHICH WOULD LIMIT POLISH </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  THE NETHERLANDS REP CLOSED HIS PRESENTATION </p><p>BY NOTING THAT THE POLISH MINISTER OF DEFENSE HAD </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT IN THE SHORT TERM POLAND WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>PRACTICE ARMED NEUTRALITY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN DEVELOPING THEIR NEW SECURITY CONCEPTS, THE </p><p>HUNGARIANS WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND WOULD TRY TO MEET SOME </p><p>SOVIET CONCERNS IN THE BILATERAL TREATY, THE GERMAN REP </p><p>ADDED.  AT THE SAME TIME, HUNGARY WOULD SEEK TIES BOTH </p><p>WITH OVERALL WESTERN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE NATO AND THE EC AS </p><p>WELL AS SMALLER REGIONAL GROUPS LIKE THE PENTAGONALE. </p><p>WHILE THEY RECOGNIZED THAT, IN SOME CASES, THESE GROUPS </p><p>DID NOT HAVE A SECURITY PURPOSE, HUNGARY DID BELIEVE </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN A NUMBER OF GROUPS WITH WESTERN TIES AIDED </p><p>THEIR SECURITY.  THE HUNGARIANS, UNLIKE THE POLES, TRIED </p><p>NOT LIKE TO USE THE TERM SECURITY VACUUM BECAUSE IT </p><p>IMPLIED THAT THERE WERE DISADVANTAGES TO THE END OF THE </p><p>WARSAW PACT, WHILE THE HUNGARIANS CLEARLY SAW THE END OF </p><p>THE PACT AS A NET SECURITY BENEFIT.  HUNGARY ALSO WANTED </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ANY PAN EUROPEAN SECURITY PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE UK REP NOTED THAT THE MORE THE EASTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES REDEFINED THEIR SECURITY THE MORE IT APPEARED TO </p><p>ISOLATE THE SOVIET UNION.  ALLIES HAD RECOGNIZED THE </p><p>DANGERS INHERENT IN THIS PROCESS, AND THE SOVIETS WOULD </p><p>USE THESE WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THEIR ISOLATION TO LIMIT THE WEST AND SPECIFICALLY NATO </p><p>TIES TO EASTERN EUROPE.  THE POLES, DURING BRITISH FOREIGN </p><p>OFFICE MINISTER HOGG\'S TRIP TO WARSAW, WERE AWARE OF THE </p><p>SOVIET CONCERNS, BUT THEY REMAINED INTERESTED IN </p><p>DEVELOPING TIES INCLUDING MILITARY LINKS TO NATO.  THEY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT POSSIBLE NOW BUT DID </p><p>NOT WANT TO RULE IT OUT AS AN ULTIMATE EVENTUALITY, EITHER. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL TREATIES WITH THE SOVIETS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE GERMAN REP NOTED THAT AS PART OF LOOKING FOR NEW </p><p>SECURITY RELATIONS, THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE </p><p>WILLING TO SIGN NEW TREATIES WITH MOSCOW.  IN THAT </p><p>CONTEXT, HE NOTED THAT DURING THE ROMANIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER\'S VISIT THERE, THE MINISTER HAD INITIALED THE </p><p>TEXT OF THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN BILATERAL TREATY.  WHILE THE </p><p>TEXT HAD NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC ITS CONTENTS WERE OF HIGH </p><p>INTEREST BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE MODEL FOR TREATIES WITH </p><p>THE OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES.  IN FACT THE SOVIETS </p><p>HAD MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED THESE TREATIES, WHICH WERE </p><p>TO REPLACE THE WP AND THE BILATERAL SECURITY TREATIES </p><p>UNDER IT, TO BE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FOR ALL THE FORMER WP </p><p>ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE GERMAN REP REPORTED THAT THEIR EMBASSIES IN </p><p>MOSCOW AND BUCHAREST BOTH AGREED THAT THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN </p><p>TREATY CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING SECURITY CLAUSES: </p><p> </p><p>--COMMITMENTS BY BOTH NOT TO JOIN ALLIANCES DIRECTED </p><p>AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; </p><p> </p><p>--COMMITMENTS NOT TO LET THEIR TERRITORIES BE USED TO WAGE </p><p>WAR AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; </p><p> </p><p>--COMMITMENTS NOT TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE OR OTHER </p><p>SUPPORT TO STATES WAGING WAR AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; </p><p> </p><p>--AGREEMENT TO BASE THEIR SECURITY ON THE COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECURITY PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER; </p><p> </p><p>--AGREEMENT TO INFORM EACH OTHER OF A PERCEIVED THREAT TO </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES; </p><p> </p><p>--AGREEMENT ON IMMEDIATE CONSULTATIONS IN THE CASE OF </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST EITHER PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE GERMAN REP SAID THAT SOVIET DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER KVITSINSKY HAD DEFENDED THE TREATY AS A SIGN OF </p><p>GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS AND NOT AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THE </p><p>PACT.  THE SOVIETS RECOGNIZED THAT THE ERA OF MILITARY </p><p>PACTS WAS OVER AND CONTINUED TO ARGUE THAT ITS EVENTUAL </p><p>EVOLUTION WOULD BE THE END OF NATO AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE GERMAN REP ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE CLAUSES IN </p><p>THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN TREATY WENT WELL BEYOND ANY WHICH BONN </p><p>ANTICIPATED OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD </p><p>ACCEPT.  HE NOTED THAT UNTIL THE INITIALING OF THE </p><p>ROMANIAN TREATY, THE SOVIET/HUNGARIAN AGREEMENT WAS </p><p>THOUGHT TO BE FARTHEST ADVANCED.  ANTALL WAS EXPECTED TO </p><p>GO TO MOSCOW TO SIGN IT AT THE END OF APRIL.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>GERMAN REP INDICATED THAT HUNGARY WOULD AS SOON HAVE NO </p><p>TREATY AS SIGN A TREATY WITH SUCH FAR REACHING CLAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE U.S. REP SAID THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY SURPRISED </p><p>WITHTHE CONTENT OF THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN TREATY WHICH HIS </p><p>GERMAN COLLEAGUEHAD DESCRIBED.  DRAWING ON REFTEL, HE </p><p>AGREED THAT OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES WERE UNLIKELY TO </p><p>BE WILLING TO GO AS FAR, AND NOTED THAT AS MUCH AS 25 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE SOVIET/HUNGARIAN TREATY REMAINED </p><p>BRACKETED.  FROM REFTEL, HE DESCRIBED THE SOVIET INTEREST </p><p>IN THIS NEW GENERATION OF TREATIES AND THE HOPE THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD ALL BE SIMILAR AND WOULD BRING SOME OF THE FORMER </p><p>WARSAW PACT GUARANTEES AND CONSULTATIONS INTO THE NEW </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THIS EXCHANGE LED TO A VIGOROUS DISCUSSION AS TO WHY </p><p>THE ROMANIANS HAD ACCEPTED SUCH CLAUSES AND WHAT THE </p><p>EFFECT WOULD BE ON OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  THE </p><p>SPANISH REP NOTED ROMANIA, BUT ALSO BULGARIA\'S SHAKY </p><p>ECONOMIES WERE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE SOVIET UNION.  THE </p><p>DUTCH REP AGREED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE NEW BILATERAL </p><p>TREATIES AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY COULD EFFECT THE ENTIRE </p><p>PAN-EUROPEAN SECURITY SITUATION.  HE ALSO REMINDED THE </p><p>COMMITTEE THAT SOVIET AMBASSADOR AFANASSIEVSKY HAD </p><p>PROPOSED TO THE SYG THAT NATO "ENDORSE" IN SOME WAY THESE </p><p>"SECURITY" CLAUSES IN THE NEW BILATERAL TREATIES.  IF THEY </p><p>WENT AS FAR AS THE ROMANIAN TREATY APPARENTLY DID, THAT </p><p>WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE.  AND IN ANY CASE, NATO SHOULD NOT </p><p>BE SEEN AS INTERFERING IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THESE TREATIES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE FRENCH REP SAID THAT SHE AGREED THESE NEW </p><p>SECURITY TREATIES WERE AN IMPORTANT NEW FACTOR AND NATO </p><p>SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR DEVELOPMENT CLOSELY.  IT WOULD, SHE </p><p>SUGGESTED, BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE SOVIETS SOUGHT TO </p><p>INCLUDE THE CONCEPTS IN THESE TREATIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF </p><p>THE OVERALL EUROPEAN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE. </p><p> </p><p>18.  PAPER CIRCULATED (COPY FAXED TO EUR/RPM). </p><p> </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION </p><p> </p><p>    --VISIT TO POLAND BY MR. HOGG, MINISTER OF STATE AT </p><p>THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, 17-19 MARCH 1991. </p><p> </p><p>KORNBLUM </p><p></p></div>
