<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002557 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT--SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/2017 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EFIN, PGOV, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON RESPONSE TO FATF CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) In June 2002 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </p><p>reviewed Nigeria\'s one-year status as a "Non-Cooperative </p><p>Country or Territory (NCCT)" and determined that it had made </p><p>no significant progress  improving anti-money laundering </p><p>controls.  At that time, the FATF publicly noted that the GON </p><p>had until October 31, 2002 to take significant steps; </p><p>otherwise, the FATF would ask its members to impose </p><p>"counter-measures" against Nigeria.  We have learned from the </p><p>U.S. Department of Treasury representative to FATF that the </p><p>decision to proceed with counter-measures will actually be </p><p>taken at the October 9 Plenary session of the FATF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  On August 28 Ambassador Jeter met with President </p><p>Obasanjo, alerting him to the possibility of imminent, </p><p>FATF-directed  "counter-measures" against Nigeria failing a </p><p>discernible, positive response by the GON within the next </p><p>five weeks.  The Ambassador outlined Nigeria\'s poor record of </p><p>communication with the FATF Secretariat in Paris and the </p><p>FATF\'s Africa and Middle East Review Group (AMERG) based in </p><p>Rome.  Jeter cited successful attempts by the FATF President </p><p>and the AMERG Chairman to engage the GON in a dialogue.  A </p><p>GON delegation to an AMERG meeting in Rome in December 2001, </p><p>led by the late Attorney General Bola Ige, had been well </p><p>received and showed promise of a sustained dialogue leading </p><p>to reform and averting Nigeria\'s censure by the FATF.  With </p><p>Ige\'s death last December, however, the dialogue stopped, </p><p>leading to the negative finding by the FATF in June 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Ambassador Jeter specifically cited a July 11 letter </p><p>from the FATF President to Obasanjo, which has not yet been </p><p>answered.  Obasanjo said he had not seen the letter but would </p><p>make sure the mail was answered adequately and quickly. </p><p>Several times repeating that Nigeria must do all it can to </p><p>avoid the anathema of FATF sanctions, the President said he </p><p>would make certain that dialogue with FATF would be resumed </p><p>by sending current Attorney General Kanu Agabi to Rome within </p><p>the next two weeks to explain that Nigeria wants to cooperate </p><p>and that it has a plan of action to enhance anti-money </p><p>laundering controls.  Giving vent to his frustration and </p><p>continuing political troubles with the National Assembly, the </p><p>President blamed part of the problem on the failure of the </p><p>legislature to pass the proposed Financial Crimes </p><p>legislation that has been languishing in the Assembly for </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  In a subsequent meeting the same day with Presidential </p><p>Permanent Secretary Steven Oronsaye and Presidential Special </p><p>Assistant for Economic Affairs Obi Ezekwesili, the Ambassador </p><p>and RNLEO raised the same points in greater detail.  Oronsaye </p><p>and Ezekwesili also said they had not seen the July 11 FATF </p><p>letter to the President but pledged to respond to it </p><p>immediately.  They also stated the GON would prepare a </p><p>delegation to visit both the AMERG in Rome and the FATF </p><p>Secretariat prior to the October 9 session of the FATF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Plenary in Paris.  Ezekwesili stated that she knows the </p><p>precise concerns of the FATF.   Like the President in his </p><p>meeting with us, she noted that a draft Financial Crimes </p><p>Bill, which would address much of the FATF\'s concerns through </p><p>structural reforms, remained stuck in the National Assembly. </p><p>However, Ezekwesili expressed confidence that the Presidency </p><p>could have the Central Bank of Nigeria adopt temporary </p><p>"circulars" or regulations to tighten reporting on financial </p><p>transactions as well as impose a greater threat of penalties </p><p>to banks that fail to report suspicious transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Comment:  The GON\'s performance vis-a-vis the FATF has </p><p>been disappointing.  We have repeatedly advised various </p><p>officials and urged the Government to deal with the FATF and </p><p>all money laundering issues more efficiently and timely. </p><p>Now, with the threat of embarrassing and perhaps financially </p><p>painful international "counter-measures," the GON seems </p><p>genuinely concerned and eager to do whatever is necessary to </p><p>convince the FATF that it wants anti-money laundering reform. </p><p> President Obasanjo seems to have designated Attorney General </p><p>Agabi as the Government\'s point-man on this issue, and the </p><p>Ambassador will meet Agabi next week.  We will find out </p><p>Agabi\'s plans at that meeting and continue to press the GON </p><p>to be responsive to FATF concerns.  Ambassador Jeter also </p><p>briefed Nigeria\'s National Security Advisor, Aliyu Mohammed, </p><p>on this issue. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
