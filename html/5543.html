<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          FEBRUARY 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 4, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SIIRT ELECTIONS MIGHT BE CANCELLED DUE TO IRAQ </p><p>WAR </p><p>(Hurriyet)  A possible U.S.-led war in Iraq has </p><p>overshadowed the March 9 Siirt elections, which was </p><p>expected to open the way for AK Party leader Recep </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan\'s premiership.  The Higher Election </p><p>Council might "postpone the elections due to de </p><p>facto incapability" if Turkey enters war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  TURKISH ARMED FORCES START REPAIR PROJECTS IN </p><p>BASES </p><p>(Radikal)  Following the recent site surveys by a </p><p>team of U.S. experts of Turkish bases and ports, </p><p>the Turkish Armed Forces has unilaterally started </p><p>repair projects (to upgrade these bases and ports). </p><p>Preparations are underway at the Incirlik (Adana) </p><p>Air Base and the Diyarbakir Airport, which will </p><p>reportedly initially be used in the event of an </p><p>operation against Iraq.  The U.S. will meet the </p><p>needs during a possible operation.  On February 3, </p><p>a C-5 Galaxy plane landed at Incirlik, where the </p><p>U.S. is stockpiling military equipment and </p><p>materials.  A missile-like object and crates of </p><p>spare parts from the giant cargo plane were </p><p>uploaded on to two trucks.  The trucks later went </p><p>to a nearby warehouse.  In addition, the number of </p><p>KC-135 tanker planes at Incirlik has increased. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TURKEY, THE U.S. WILL ESTABLISH 15 CAMPS </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Turkiye)  Possible immigration </p><p>(from Iraq) was discussed during recent evaluations </p><p>held between Turkey and the U.S.  To prevent a wave </p><p>of immigration, 15 different camps will initially </p><p>be established in northern Iraq.  The number of </p><p>these camps might rise to 23 if immigration </p><p>increases.  The U.S. Time Magazine wrote that </p><p>Turkey and the U.S. had agreed to establish 17 </p><p>refugee camps in the region, including 10 on the </p><p>Iraqi side, if an operation started against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  SPECIAL TEAMS WILL BE WORKING IN CAMPS </p><p>(Turkiye/Milli Gazete)  Officials have determined </p><p>the names of nearly 1,000 people who will be </p><p>working in tent cities to be established in </p><p>northern Iraq in the event of a war against Iraq. </p><p>The Diyarbakir Security Directorate will dispatch a </p><p>team of 70 specialists to the border.  Efforts are </p><p>also underway to prepare a 1,000-person list of </p><p>health, Tele-com, and Village Affairs Directorate </p><p>personnel in Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, Batman, </p><p>Hakkari, and Van.  Also, the Diyarbakir National </p><p>Education Directorate has produced a list of 200 </p><p>teachers to serve in these tent cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  DISPATCH OF TROOPS TO IRAQI BORDER CONTINUES </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milli Gazete)  The Turkish Armed Forces </p><p>is dispatching additional troops and military </p><p>equipment, including armored vehicles, to its units </p><p>along the (Iraqi) border.  Security units have been </p><p>warned against possible terrorist infiltration, and </p><p>thermal cameras along the 280-km Turkish-Iraqi </p><p>border are being checked.  Some banks and public </p><p>organizations have established mobile units.  The </p><p>number of tents set up by the Red Crescent has </p><p>reached 300.  Four other tents were set up to store </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  Cumhuriyet reported that </p><p>troops, military equipment, and materials left </p><p>Tekirdag, Adapazari, Ankara, and Istanbul are being </p><p>kept in Sanliurfa for dispatch to the Southeast </p><p>after the February 11-14 Sacrifice Holiday.  Bolu </p><p>and Kayseri commando teams, which had been used </p><p>during the anti-terror period in the Southeast, </p><p>might also be dispatched to the region again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  "THERE ARE NO STANDARD SHELTERS IN TURKEY" </p><p>(Turkiye/Bolge)  In line with an order from the </p><p>Civil Defense Directorate General, the Malatya </p><p>Civil Defense Directorate held a civil defense </p><p>seminar.  In his speech, Malatya Civil Defense </p><p>Director Ibrahim Ozay said his directorate was </p><p>organizing activities in accordance with the </p><p>possibility of a war that might break out as a </p><p>result of the tension between the U.S. and Iraq. </p><p>Ozay noted that there are no shelters built in </p><p>accordance with the standards.  He added that, in </p><p>case of an emergency, the basement of public </p><p>buildings, car parks, aparmant buildings, and </p><p>business centers would be used as shelters.  In </p><p>addition, a meeting entitled "Effects of Chemical </p><p>and Biological Agents" was held in Adana\'s </p><p>Physicians\' Chamber.  In his speech, Assistant </p><p>Professor Ferdi Tanir of Cukurova University </p><p>(Adana) said that not all shelters would save lives </p><p>because the province\'s shelters are insufficient. </p><p>Tanir stressed that shelters must be in an </p><p>appropriate location and have necessary equipment </p><p>to protect against chemical gases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  MERSIN BUSINESS LEADER AGAINST WAR </p><p>Dunya reported that Mersin businessmen are </p><p>concerned over a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq. </p><p>Musa Timur, President of the Mersin Industrialists </p><p>and Businessmen\'s Association (MESIAD), voiced </p><p>opposition to a possible war, claiming that the </p><p>provincial economy fell from the fifth province to </p><p>the 19th on a nationwide list.  "It feels like </p><p>bombs dropped on Iraq have fallen on Mersin.  A new </p><p>war will cause the Mersin economy to hit the </p><p>bottom," he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Demonstrations were held in Igdir, </p><p>Hakkari, Batman, and Sanliurfa to protest the nine- </p><p>week isolation of jailed KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan.  In Tunceli, relatives of prisoners and </p><p>inmates began a hunger strike.  In addition, a pro- </p><p>Ocalan campaign was launched in Bismil </p><p>(Diyarbakir).  Under the campaign, demonstrations </p><p>will be held every day until February 15.  Also, </p><p>pro-Ocalan marches were held in Diyarbakir\'s six </p><p>different districts on February 3.  Pro-Ocalan </p><p>slogans were shouted during the marches, while </p><p>police did not intervene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  NO PERMISSION FOR ANTI-WAR PRESS CONFERENCE IN </p><p>DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Diyarbakir Governor\'s Office </p><p>refused to grant permission for a press conference </p><p>which the Diyarbakir Democratic Youth Platform </p><p>wanted to organize in protest of a possible U.S.- </p><p>led operation against Iraq and prison isolation. </p><p>When a group of 200 people, including women and </p><p>HADEP Youth Commission members, insisted on holding </p><p>the press conference, police told HADEP officials </p><p>that it was unlawful to hold a press conference and </p><p>wanted them their demonstration.  Some members of </p><p>the group instead staged a sit-down demonstration </p><p>and shouted pro-KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan </p><p>slogans.  Then, police intervened to disperse them. </p><p>During the scuffle, many people were reportedly </p><p>injured and over 20 others arrested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  TEACHERS INVESTIGATED FOR ATTENDING A RALLY </p><p>(Evrensel)  Under Article 130 of the Law number </p><p>657, the Diyarbakir National Education Directorate </p><p>has launched an administrative investigation </p><p>against sixty local teachers, all members of the </p><p>State Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK).  The </p><p>investigation stemmed from the teachers\' </p><p>participation in the August 2002 KESK rally in </p><p>Ankara.  The law requires public employees to </p><p>receive official permission for travel outside </p><p>their province.  The Diyarbakir Egitim-Sen teachers </p><p>union President, Abdullah Demirtas, called the </p><p>investigation "arbitrary." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  OHAL CIRCULAR STILL IN EFFECT </p><p>(Evrensel)  The former government of Bulent Ecevit </p><p>had published a circular to prevent the </p><p>reinstatement of public employees transferred from </p><p>the State of Emergency (OHAL) region.  Following </p><p>the lifting of OHAL, former Diyarbakir teacher </p><p>Abdurrahim Kutlu petitioned the Diyarbakir </p><p>Governor\'s Office to be reinstated.  However, the </p><p>Governoer\'s Office, presumably based on the </p><p>circular, refused to process Kutlu\'s petition, </p><p>saying "it was inconsistent with the regulation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  SYRIA WELCOMES PROPOSED MARKETS ALONG THE </p><p>BORDER </p><p>(Turkiye)  AK Party Kilis Deputy Hasan Kara, who </p><p>had accompanied State Minister Kursad Tuzmen during </p><p>his trip to Syria, said the Syrian government </p><p>favored the idea of establishing open-air markets </p><p>or free zones along the Turkish-Syrian border. </p><p>During the trip aimed at increasing economic </p><p>cooperation between the two countries, the Turkish </p><p>delegation had met with the Syrian Prime Minister, </p><p>as well as seven ministers. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
