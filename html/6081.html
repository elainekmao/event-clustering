<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 3/3 COB: MARKETS STABILIZE, </p><p>BUT DEBT FINANCING A CONCERN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1351 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Stabilize in Afternoon Trading </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Turkish financial markets at COB March 3 stabilized </p><p>after a rough morning which saw relatively heavy capital </p><p>outflows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira depreciated about 3 percent, closing at TL </p><p>1,651,000 to the dollar.  The Central Bank markets department </p><p>reported a net capital outflow today of $120 million, $85 </p><p>million from one bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The benchmark T-bills closed at 60 percent in annually </p><p>compounded terms, up 5.5 percentage points on the day, in </p><p>heavy trading volume of TL 830 trillion (about $550 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Istanbul Stock Exchange dropped 12.5 percent in </p><p>relatively heavy  trading of TL 458 trillion (about $300 </p><p>million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment:  As reported at mid-day (reftel), the </p><p>sell-offs were contained by two factors: first, PM Gul\'s </p><p>press statement on the budget, backed by the IMF Mission </p><p>Chief\'s supporting statement; second, a hope among some </p><p>investors that the U.S. package will soon become available, </p><p>becuase the parliament will pass a second troop deployment </p><p>resolution.  As Lehman Bros analyst told us, "The bad news of </p><p>no U.S. package is not priced in.  It would lead to a second </p><p>sell-off, with Eurobonds dropping another 4-5 percentage </p><p>points, and T-bill yields ending up at 65 percent or higher." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment Continued:  Looking ahead, the March 19 </p><p>domestic debt redemption of TL 5.2 quadrillion (about $3.5 </p><p>billion) is a concern.  The Treasury may well use up some of </p><p>its cash reserves of TL 4.2 quadrillion to take care of the </p><p>March 5 redemption, leaving less flexibility to take care of </p><p>the larger March 19 redemption.  The "safety valve" may be </p><p>for Treasury to use moral suasion with the state banks </p><p>(especially Ziraat) to step up and buy more GOT debt.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Resrep:  Financing Gap a Concern </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  IMF resrep told us March 3 that Fund staff are </p><p>reviewing the the financing assumptions behind the 2003 </p><p>budget (basically, an average T-bill interest rate of 45 </p><p>percent, 90 percent debt roll-over rate, 8 month average </p><p>maturity), wich he noted do not take into consideration the </p><p>effect of an Iraq operation.  Fund staff cannot recommend </p><p>their Board approve the Fourth Review, if the GOT faces a </p><p>funding gap in 2003, he stressed.  Mission Chief Kahkonen\'s </p><p>March 3 press statement says the GOT draft budget achieves a </p><p>6.5 percent primary surplus, but it doesn\'t say this is </p><p>sufficient for the GOT\'s funding needs, he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>February Inflation Data:  Credibility of </p><p>Macro Framework May Be Questioned </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) At market close March 3, the State Statistics </p><p>Institute released the February inflation data: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                    February   January </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Consumer Prices     2.3 pct    2.6 pct </p><p>Wholesale Prices    3.1 pct    5.6 pct </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment: The February inflation results are in </p><p>line with market expectations, and seasonal adjustments (for </p><p>higher food prices in winter) should reduce them.  The </p><p>government-controlled price increases of January affected </p><p>February CPI, but this is not a lasting effect.  Neverthless, </p><p>two straight months of high inflation may start to have a </p><p>corrosive effect on market acceptance of the GOT\'s </p><p>macro-economic framework.  We\'re two months into the year and </p><p>the aggregate WPI is nearly half of the year-end target.  We </p><p>will check the Central Bank\'s next inflation expectations </p><p>survey (due out in mid-March) to see if expectations are </p><p>affected. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
