<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR J. FRAZIER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/1/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INEC CHAIRMAN DISMISSES CHARGES OF UNDER- </p><p>REGISTRATION AS "LOOSE TALK" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During an October 30 meeting with Chiefs </p><p>of Mission from key western and other countries, INEC </p><p>Chairman Abel Guobadia discussed INEC\'s performance during </p><p>the recent voter registration and its plans for the spring </p><p>general election.  Guobadia dismissed allegations of both </p><p>significant under-registration and fraudulent multiple </p><p>registration, but conceded if evidence of wide spread </p><p>problems were found, INEC would extend the voter </p><p>registration period.  Those who were unable to register </p><p>would have to prove their case to INEC before they would be </p><p>added to the rolls.  Despite worries expressed by the </p><p>diplomats, Guobadia was confident INEC\'s "biometric </p><p>profiling" plan would eliminate most multiple registrants. </p><p>Finally, Guobadia requested donor assistance to procure </p><p>election materials; train election day staff; plan </p><p>logistical preparations; and create a radio network to </p><p>disseminate election results quickly.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 30 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>representatives of other Western Missions including the </p><p>British, Australian and Canadian High Commissions, and </p><p>envoys of the Burkinabe and Ghanaian governments, </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman </p><p>Abel Guobadia discussed the September voter registration </p><p>exercise and INEC\'s plans for the spring general election. </p><p>After clarifying the USG\'s desire to assist Nigeria and his </p><p>belief that the upcoming election currently makes INEC the </p><p>most important institution in Nigeria, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>noted there has been widespread criticism of the sub- </p><p>standard registration process.  Deputy British High </p><p>Commissioner Charles Bird further characterized the </p><p>registration process as "seriously flawed in terms of </p><p>under-registration". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Guobadia said he had not seen evidence of under- </p><p>registration.  No one had come to INEC complaining he could </p><p>not register.  Guobadia discounted the allegations as being </p><p>based more in speculation and rumor than in fact.  "It\'s </p><p>all loose talk," he claimed.  He stated INEC had </p><p>distributed 71 million registration forms for an estimated </p><p>voting population of 59.5 million.  According to Guobadia, </p><p>only 2 million of the forms were left unused after the </p><p>registration period.  Therefore, he reasoned, "nearly all </p><p>eligible persons should have registered," since even if one </p><p>accounted for lost or stolen materials and marginal numbers </p><p>of multiple registrants, there were more than enough </p><p>registration materials for everyone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Bird cautioned that he had witnessed people unable </p><p>to register and questioned whether INEC was prepared to </p><p>issue a public statement saying under-registration was </p><p>minimal.  Guobadia deflected Bird\'s question and reiterated </p><p>his prior statement that the small number of leftover </p><p>materials has led him to conclude under-registration was </p><p>minimal.  (COMMENT: Guobadia\'s defensive statements about </p><p>the registration exercise were unfortunate.  Nationwide </p><p>claims of under-registration undermine his credibility as </p><p>an impartial administrator.  Moreover, we know that INEC is </p><p>having severe problems reconciling the rolls.  It was </p><p>scheduled to publish the registration lists by September </p><p>26.  Already more than a month overdue, the list is still </p><p>not ready to be published because of the numerous </p><p>inaccuracies in the registration process.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Canadian High Commissioner Howard Strauss mentioned </p><p>reports that as many as 10 million people registered more </p><p>than once.  If true, the multiple registrants account for </p><p>the large number of unregistered voters despite the </p><p>scarcity of unused forms (NOTE: Additionally, there have </p><p>been unconfirmed reports of hoarding of the forms and </p><p>registration cards in several areas.  The culprits may have </p><p>filled in the forms and kept the cards to give to local </p><p>partisans.  END NOTE).  Guobadia said biometric profiling </p><p>by state and local governments would eliminate most of the </p><p>multiple registrants.  Fingerprints taken at the time of </p><p>registration would be compiled within "computer-based State </p><p>and Local Government Area Preliminary Registers" and then </p><p>used to identify those who registered more than once or who </p><p>falsely claimed they were unable to register. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Guobadia admitted it would not be possible to </p><p>complete a nation-wide database at this time, but he did </p><p>not think it necessary since he expected incidents of </p><p>"inter-state" multiple registrations to be few.  INEC does </p><p>not plan to release the register for inspection until after </p><p>the electronic state and local databases have been </p><p>compiled.  (COMMENT: Guobadia\'s reliance on the corrective </p><p>properties of the thumb print analysis may be overly </p><p>optimistic.  It is uncertain whether every state possesses </p><p>the computer equipment for such a venture and it is likely </p><p>poorly trained registration officials made numerous </p><p>mistakes in taking registrants\' fingerprints.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ambassador Jeter stressed that the perception of </p><p>serious under-registration could undermine legitimacy of </p><p>the entire election.  He suggested INEC consider an </p><p>extended registration period if problems proved wide- </p><p>spread.  Guobadia said INEC would extend the registration </p><p>period, but those who claimed inability to register would </p><p>have to prove their claims to INEC.  Regardless of any </p><p>extension of the registration process, the elections would </p><p>take place between March 29 and April 29, 2003 as required </p><p>by law.  Regarding the registration of new political </p><p>parties, Guobadia said if the courts had not settled the </p><p>dispute before December 29, then only the six existing </p><p>parties would be able to take part in the election. </p><p>(COMMENT: Guobadia\'s remark about the December 29 deadline </p><p>is very bureaucratic and shows a lack of appreciation of </p><p>the role of the courts.  It will be the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>verdict, not INEC\'s, that will determine if additional </p><p>parties will participate.  Ultimately, if the Supreme Court </p><p>rules that INEC must accept the registration of additional </p><p>parties, INEC will have to do so regardless of its </p><p>bureaucratic deadlines.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Guobadia said INEC was doing everything possible to </p><p>pressure law enforcement authorities to investigate claims </p><p>of registration fraud and theft of registration materials. </p><p>He emphasized the existence of severe penalties for </p><p>violating election laws, but admitted that INEC, itself, </p><p>was dependent upon law enforcement officials to enforce </p><p>election law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) While Guobadia said he welcomed the participation </p><p>of Nigerian civil society groups in the election process, </p><p>he did not think it was INEC\'s responsibility to provide </p><p>them with training in election monitoring or assistance. </p><p>INEC plans to produce a best practices manual for such </p><p>organizations.  He also noted that only one group, the </p><p>National Committee for Justice, Peace and Development, </p><p>assisted INEC during the registration process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) On the question of the participation of </p><p>international observers in the election, Guobadia said the </p><p>Foreign Ministry would issue invitations no later than two </p><p>months before the election date.  He believed the </p><p>invitations would go out well before that deadline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) When asked by Ambassador Jeter about INEC\'s </p><p>budget, Guobadia noted that INEC had problems obtaining </p><p>funding from the government.  19.5 billion Naira (USD 154 </p><p>million) to finance the election were included in the </p><p>National Assembly\'s budget, however, only the 7 billion </p><p>Naira (USD 55 million) allocated for the registration </p><p>process had been released.  He felt the GON would release </p><p>the remainder of the funds soon, but welcomed any pressure </p><p>the USG or any other government could bring to bare on the </p><p>matter.  Guobadia also noted that public criticism of GON </p><p>interference with INEC improved the GON\'s behavior toward </p><p>the commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Guobadia requested assistance in purchasing </p><p>printed materials such as election monitoring manuals and </p><p>in arranging training for INEC workers.  He said INEC would </p><p>welcome any assistance in transporting materials and </p><p>workers throughout the country and in providing </p><p>communications equipment for INEC personnel.  INEC is also </p><p>interested in creating a radio network to disseminate </p><p>election results quickly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) COMMENT: Guobadia\'s performance was predictable </p><p>although unsatisfactory in many respects.  We were </p><p>disappointed that he was less than forthcoming about the </p><p>problems with voter registration, but sense that he might </p><p>speak more openly in a more intimate setting (We will seek </p><p>a private meeting with INEC to reinforce our concerns about </p><p>voter registration.). Public concern regarding the </p><p>registration will not go away simply because Guobadia wants </p><p>it to.  Guobadia and INEC have had a slight respite from </p><p>intense public scrutiny due to the impeachment attempt on </p><p>President Obasanjo.  But as the impeachment drama slowly </p><p>fades, attention will return to INEC.  INEC can repair some </p><p>of the damage done to its credibility by demonstrating that </p><p>it is attempting to repair the defective registration </p><p>exercise.  The most visible fix would be to extend voter </p><p>registration.  By reopening the process and taking other </p><p>corrective measures, INEC can improve the voter list while </p><p>helping to restore public confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  C) While INEC is behind the curve and has been marred </p><p>by laconic performance, it is not irredeemable.  However, </p><p>the international community must lend a helping hand for </p><p>INEC to reach an acceptable level of performance.  The </p><p>international community will have to concentrate sustained </p><p>pressure on INEC, the Presidency, and the National Assembly </p><p>to makes sure INEC does an adequate job.  Apart from </p><p>correcting flaws in the registration, the next order of </p><p>business may be to push the Presidency and the National </p><p>Assembly to fund INEC properly.  We are preparing to do </p><p>that.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
