(U)  A FARC ATTACK IN GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT SEPTEMBER 6 LEFT A </p><p>REPORTED 22 COLOMBIAN ARMY (COLAR) SOLDIERS DEAD.

(U)  THE FARC FIRST FRONT KILLED 22 SOLDIERS SEPTEMBER 6 IN </p><p>LA CARPA, A PEASANT HAMLET TWO HOURS DISTANT BY RIVER LAUNCH FROM </p><p>SAN JOSE, CAPITAL OF GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO SEPTEMBER </p><p>8 NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS, 300 TO 400 MEMBERS OF THE THE FARC FIRST </p><p>FRONT UNDER THE COMMAND OF "MONO JOJOY" (KNOWN AS THE JUAN JOSE </p><p>RONDON MOBILE COLUMN) ENTERED LA CARPA SEPTEMBER 5 AND, WIELDING </p><p>MACHETES AND KNIVES, INTIMIDATED THE 50 RESIDENTS.

IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, </p><p>THE UNIT ARRIVED AT LA CARPA, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY GUERRILLAS </p><p>LYING IN WAIT.  DESPITE THE WARNINGS OF LA CARPA RESIDENTS, THE </p><p>SOLDIERS REMAINED.  AT 6:00 AM GUERRILLAS OPENED MACHINEGUN FIRE </p><p>ON THE TOWN, WOUNDING SEVERAL SOLDIERS.  THE SOLDIERS ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO REPEL THE ATTACK WITH RIFLES BUT WERE CLEARLY SURROUNDED. </p><p>AFTER TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING, GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED FRAGMENTATION </p><p>GRENADES TO FORCE THE SOLDIERS TO GIVE UP.  THE COLAR UNIT </p><p>COMMANDER REQUESTED AIR AND LAND SUPPORT, BUT NONE ARRIVED. </p><p>AFTER THE GRENADE ATTACK, THE SURVIVING SOLDIERS SOUGHT REFUGE IN </p><p>THE JUNGLE, AND THE GUERRILLAS SENT A REPORTED 20 DOBERMAN </p><p>PINSCHERS INTO THE JUNGLE TO LOCATE THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS.  TWO </p><p>HOURS LATER, ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS, </p><p>CARRYING COLAR REINFORCEMENTS, ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  THEY FOUND </p><p>19 SOLDIERS DEAD, 1O WOUNDED, 11 SURVIVERS, AND TWO MISSING IN </p><p>ACTION.  BY AUGUST 9 THE NUMBER OF DEAD HAD RISEN TO 22 SOLDIERS. </p><p>THE DEAD AND WOUNDED WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE AIRPORT IN SAN JOSE, </p><p>GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT, JUST AS STAFFDEL MACKEY ARRIVED FROM BOGOTA </p><p>THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 7 (REF C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OTHER ATTACKS THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  PRESS ACCOUNTS SEPTEMBER 9 SUMMARIZED OTHER INCIDENTS </p><p>SEEN AS PART OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE AS IT CONTINUED OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 7-8: </p><p> </p><p>--   IN LOS REMEDIOS, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, A CLASH BETWEEN </p><p>     ELN AND GOVERNMENT FORCES SEPTEMBER 8 LEFT TWO SOLDIERS </p><p>     AND ONE GUERRILLA DEAD.  TWO CHILDREN WERE WOUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, THE ARMY KILLED TWO ELN </p><p>     GUERRILLAS ATTEMPTING TO PLACE A BOMB ON A BRIDGE OVER </p><p>     THE CARANAL RIVER. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN ZULIA, NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, DIALOGUE </p><p>     BETWEEN THE GOC AND CAMPESINOS WAS SUSPENDED.  THE ARMY </p><p>     ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO PREVENT 200 PROTESTING </p><p>     CAMPESINOS FROM ENTERING CUCUTA. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN NARINO DEPARTMENT, GUERRILLAS EXPLODED A SECTION OF </p><p>     THE TRANSANDEAN OIL PIPELINE NEAR THE MUNICIPALITY OF </p><p>     MALLAMA. </p><p> </p><p>--   AUTHORITIES IN NARINO DEPARTMENT SUSPENDED CARGO AND </p><p>     PASSENGER TRAFFIC ON THE ROADS BECAUSE OF GUERRILLA </p><p>     THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>--   MEMBERS OF THE ELN\'S LUIS CARLOS CARDENAS FRONT </p><p>     ASSAULTED THE POLICE STATION IN THE HAMLET OF MAGDALENA </p><p>     IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN BARRANCABERMEJA, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, GUERRILLAS </p><p>     DISTRIBUTED FLYERS ANNOUNCING THEIR INTENTION TO </p><p>     PARALYZE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA FOR FIVE DAYS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>     ACTIVITY REMAINED NORMAL IN BARRANCABERMEJA AS OF </p><p>     SEPTEMBER 8. </p><p> </p><p>--   GUERRILLAS BURNED VEHICLES ON ROADS LEADING TO CUCUTA, </p><p>     NORTE DE SANTANDER, SEVERELY RESTRICTING TRAFFIC. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL REGION, GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES </p><p>     RESTRICTED TRAFFIC ON NUMEROUS ROADS. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN SUCRE DEPARTMENT, THREE CAMPESINOS WERE REPORTEDLY </p><p>     KILLED BY A GROUP OF 30 ARMED PARAMILITARIES. </p><p> </p><p>--   IN URABA, THE FIFTH FARC FRONT REPORTEDLY EXECUTED FOUR </p><p>     CAMPESINO LEADERS, CHARGED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION </p><p>     TO THE ARMY, IN A TOWN NEAR APARTADO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FARC STILL HOLDS 60 SOLDIERS CAPTIVE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  MEANWHILE, THE FARC CONTINUES TO HOLD THE ESTIMATED 60 </p><p>SOLDIERS CAPTURED IN THE ATTACK ON LAS DELICIAS, PUTUMAYO </p><p>DEPARTMENT, DESPITE THE FARC\'S DECLARATION IT WAS PREPARED TO </p><p>RELEASE THE SOLDIERS TO THE ICRC (REF A).  AN APPEAL BY HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS WATCH FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLDIERS HAS FAILED TO MOVE </p><p>THE FARC LEADERSHIP TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ITS STATED COMMITMENT </p><p>TO THE ICRC.  CRITICS CHARGE THAT THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS USING </p><p>THE HOSTAGE SOLDIERS TO PROTECT ITSELF AND TO GAIN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ATTENTION.  INTERIOR MINISTER HORACIO SERPA TOLD THE PRESS </p><p>SEPTEMBER 8 THAT THE FARC ARE TRYING TO USE THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>SOLDIERS AS A NEGOTIATING ARGUMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON </p><p>A POSSIBLE DIALOGUE ON PEACE.  SERPA INSISTED THAT IF THE </p><p>GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE COMPLYING WITH NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>HUMANITARIAN LAW AS THEY CLAIM TO BE, THERE IS NOTHING TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOC.  PIERRE GASSMAN, ICRC DIRECTOR IN BOGOTA, </p><p>TOLD THE PRESS HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE GUERRILLAS HOPED TO </p><p>ACHIEVE BY HOLDING THE SOLDIERS, BUT SAID THEY CANNOT, UNDER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, DEMAND ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE FOR </p><p>THE SOLDIERS.  TO DO SO, SAID GASSMAN, WOULD BE TO COMMIT THE </p><p>PUNISHABLE CRIME OF EXTORTION BY KIDNAPPING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SAMPER ANNOUNCES COUNTER-GUERRILLA STRATEGY </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  ON SEPTEMBER 8, BOGOTA DAILY "EL TIEMPO" REPORTED </p><p>PRESIDENT SAMPER HAD ANNOUNCED HIS ADMINISTRATION\'S INTENTION TO </p><p>EMPLOY THREE KEY STRATEGIES TO COUNTER THE RECENTLY ESCALATED </p><p>GUERRILLA ATTACKS MORE EFFECTIVELY.  ACCORDING TO "EL TIEMPO," </p><p>THE STRATEGIES FOCUS ON INCREASED HUMAN AND ELECTRONIC </p><p>INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING, INCREASED AIR, LAND AND WATER MOBILITY, </p><p>AND UPGRADED COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES.  SAMPER ALSO CALLED ON </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN PUBLIC TO SUPPORT CURRENT PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS TO </p><p>INCREASE THE MILITARY BUDGET AND BROADEN MILITARY JURISDICTIONAL </p><p>PRIVILEGE -- THE "FUERO MILITAR" (REF B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE, AND THE FARC LEADERSHIP HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY INDICATED, THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT WILL KEEP UP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE GOC AND THE COLOMBIAN PUBLIC WITH CONTINUED </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE WEEKS TO COME.  CHARACTERIZING THE ATTACKS AS </p><p>RETALIATION AGAINST THE GOC FOR ITS COUNTER-NARCOTICS OPERATIONS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN, COCA-GROWING REGIONS OF COLOMBIA, DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER ESGUERRA TOLD THE PRESS THE GUERRILLAS HAVE THE CAPACITY </p><p>TO CONDUCT CONTINUED "SPECTACULAR" ATTACKS BUT LACK THE POTENTIAL </p><p>TO OCCUPY MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS OR EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>TERRITORIAL CONTROL.  YET THE ESTIMATED 10,000-MEMBER GUERRILLA </p><p>FORCE BELIEVED TO EXIST AND TO BE GROWING IN COLOMBIA TODAY </p><p>(COMBINED FARC AND ELN) CLEARLY IS IN A STRONG POSITION TO </p><p>DISRUPT AND DESTABILIZE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, EVEN </p><p>IF IT IS NOT IN A POSITION TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS\' INCREASED NUMBERS HAVE ENABLED THEM TO FORM FIGHTING </p><p>UNITS OF 200 TO 400 MEN -- LARGE ENOUGH TO OUTNUMBER AND </p><p>OVERWHELM MANY OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMY UNITS STATIONED IN </p><p>CONFLICTIVE AREAS.  AS ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL BEDOYA POINTED OUT </p><p>TO ACTING POL/ECON COUNSELOR SEPTEMBER 7, THE GUERRILLAS ENJOY </p><p>CERTAIN ADVANTAGES IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE WHICH ENABLE THEM </p><p>TO EVADE THE COLOMBIAN ARMY, AS THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP 60 HOSTAGE </p><p>SOLDIERS IN AN UNKNOWN LOCATION  AND PREVENTED FROM RESCUE BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT FORCES ILLUSTRATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KNEEBONE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
