SAUDI PRESS COMMENTS </p><p> </p><p>SAUDI PRESS EDITORIAL COMMENTS ON THE JEDDAH MEETING WERE </p><p>HEAVY ON RHETORIC.

WE MUST </p><p>UNDERLINE THAT ARAB NATION AS A WHOLE ATTACHES GREAT </p><p>HOPES TO THE JEDDAH BROTHERLY MEETING.  THE ARAB NATION </p><p>IS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE </p><p>IRAQI-KUWAITI DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>AL-YAUM </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>THE JEDDAH MEETING IS A PRACTICAL STEP FOR BYPASSING ALL </p><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IRAQ AND KUWAIT. </p><p>THIS STEP WILL DEFINITELY LEAD TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE </p><p>AMBITIONS OF THE ARAB LEADERS FOR KEEPING THE ARAB NATION </p><p>AWAY FROM ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT IMPEDE THE PROCESS </p><p>OF ARAB SOLIDARITY. </p><p> </p><p>AL-JAZEERA </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>HOSTING BY THE KINGDOM OF THE JEDDAH MEETING, AS SHEIKH </p><p>ABDALLAH PUT IT, CONFIRMS THE PERMANENT INTEREST OF THE </p><p>KINGDOM IN PLAYING ITS PIONEERING HISTORIC ROLE TO </p><p>CONFRONT ALL ISSUES OF THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC NATIONS AND </p><p>TO WORK SERIOUSLY FOR UNIFICATION OF THE WORD OF THIS </p><p>NATION. </p><p> </p><p>AL-JAZEERA, JASSER AL-JASSER </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE QUICK POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE EFFORTS OF THE ARAB </p><p>LEADERS FOR CONTAINMENT OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN IRAQ AN </p><p>KUWAIT POINTS OUT TWO FACTS: STRENGTH OF THE ARAB TIES </p><p>AND CONFIDENCE OF THE ARAB NATION IN THE PRUDENCE OF ITS </p><p>LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  AL-RIYADH DAILY QUOTED THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS FROM </p><p>THE IRAQI AND KUWAITI NEWSPAPERS: </p><p> </p><p>AL-QABAS (KUWAIT) </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>ALL SINCERE ARABS, IN THE FOREFRONT BEING THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>KUWAIT, HOLD GREAT HOPE THAT THE JEDDAH MEETING WOULD BE </p><p>THE MOTIVE FOR CONSOLIDATING THE BROTHERLY TIES BETWEEN </p><p>IRAQ AND KUWAIT.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE WORLD WILL </p><p>COME TO KNOW THAT OUR NATION IS CAPABLE OF WORKING OUT </p><p>ITS PROBLEM BY ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>AL-RAI AL-AAM (KUWAIT) </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>ALL EYES ARE SET ON JEDDAH HOPING FOR SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>IRAQ-KUWAIT MEETING.  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS BETWEEN </p><p>KUWAIT AND IRAQ WERE TRANSIENT AND WE ARE SURE THAT THE </p><p>JEDDAH MEETING WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL ONE. </p><p> </p><p>AL-QADESEYA (IRAQ) </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ RESPONDED TO THE JEDDAH MEETING IN ORDER TO PRESERVE </p><p>THE HIGHER ARAB INTERESTS AND IN APPRECIATION TO THE </p><p>EFFORTS OF THE ARAB LEADERS.  THE PAPER POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>THE MEETING BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT IS A CHANCE FOR </p><p>LIQUIDATING THE DIFFERENCES AND BEEFING UP THE </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  BBC ARABIC SERVICE REPORTED JULY 31 THAT IRAQI PRESS </p><p>LAUNCHED A VEHEMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST KUWAIT AND SAID </p><p>AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT IRAQ\'S INTERESTS ARE ABOVE ARAB </p><p>SOLIDARITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DUNFORD </p><p></p></div>
