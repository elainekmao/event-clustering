The PSD has increased the threat level </p><p>in the country to the highest degree possible, and has </p><p>assigned additional marked police cars, roving patrols, and </p><p>plain clothes personnel to these tasks.  Working-level PSD </p><p>and GID officials have been tasked to pursue leads from </p><p>intelligence sources within the Palestinian, Iraqi, and </p><p>radical Islamic communities to learn possible identities of </p><p>the culprits. </p><p> </p><p>4.
