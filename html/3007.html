<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR ECA/PE/C/CU; NEA/PPD (CBOURGEOIS, JBAROODY, </p><p>JGAFFNEY); NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Mr. Robert McNamara - Target-of-Opportunity </p><p>Musician: Evaluation </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: PAS Amman organized three public concerts and </p><p>two workshops for musician Mr. Robert McNamara during his </p><p>program in Jordan on May 19 through May 21.  Mr. McNamara\'s </p><p>program in Jordan was the first of PAS\' cultural programs to </p><p>be pursued following the events taking place in the region. </p><p>Regardless of the general dispirited sentiment among </p><p>Jordanians, various groups of people attended his concerts </p><p>and enjoyed listening to him strumming on the guitar and </p><p>attuned themselves to the medieval notes of the lute.  Mr. </p><p>McNamara\'s love for music and his instruments had a positive </p><p>effect on his audiences, stirring up their admiration for </p><p>his music.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Description of Activity: Both Mr. McNamara\'s public </p><p>concerts were cosponsored by The National Music Conservatory </p><p>and The Blue Fig Cafe.  The first concert was a solo </p><p>performance held in the main hall of the caf.  Mr. </p><p>McNamara\'s second concert was a special performance, as it </p><p>was a fundraising event from which all proceeds were donated </p><p>to the West Bank\'s Bir Zeit University\'s conservatory.  Mr. </p><p>McNamara performed alongside talented Jordanian musicians </p><p>with whom he had rehearsed in preparation for the special </p><p>tribute.  The third and final concert was held at the multi- </p><p>national American Community School (A.C.S.) for the entire </p><p>student body, 360 students (kindergarten through Grade 12) </p><p>and teaching staff.  The first of Mr. McNamara\'s workshops </p><p>was held at the National Music Conservatory for a number of </p><p>students and instructors.  The second workshop was held at </p><p>the Yarmouk University\'s faculty of Fine Arts for almost </p><p>eighty students of music and faculty members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Press Coverage: There were regular daily radio </p><p>announcements prior to Mr. McNamara\'s public concerts.  On </p><p>May 20, "Al-Ra\'i" leading Arabic daily ran an article </p><p>announcing the fundraising concert at Blue Fig Caf.  The </p><p>article discussed the rationale behind the concert and </p><p>pointed out that Mr. McNamara\'s involvement in such an event </p><p>proved that artistic expression is a channel for </p><p>communication, regardless of the critical turn of events in </p><p>the region.  The Star Weekly also ran an article on the </p><p>fundraising concert at Blue Fig Caf on May 23, declaring </p><p>the joint efforts of the National Music Conservatory and </p><p>Blue Fig Caf as a promotion of cultural awareness and </p><p>understanding through music under a banner of support for </p><p>the Palestinian cause.  The article commented that Mr. </p><p>McNamara\'s style was "Wonderfully direct and informative." </p><p>The use of the lute in Mr. McNamara\'s performance was much </p><p>enjoyed by the writer, who was in the audience and described </p><p>ed </p><p>it as "A wonderfully gentle introduction to what became a </p><p>light and enjoyable music lesson."  The article also touched </p><p>on Mr. McNamara\'s other activities in Jordan, such as his </p><p>workshops at Yarmouk University and the National Music </p><p>Conservatory and it also mentioned his solo performance at </p><p>Blue Fig Caf.  Mr. McNamara was also featured on a live </p><p>radio show on Jordan\'s FM English Language Radio Station </p><p>alongside a Jordanian oud player.  They discussed the fusion </p><p>of their music and commented on the success of their work </p><p>together.  Mr. McNamara was interviewed for an hour.  In the </p><p>program, Mr. McNamara also declared his interest in </p><p>introducing his music to Jordanian audiences as a reflection </p><p>of American culture and in return introducing new oriental </p><p>qualities to his own music. </p><p> </p><p>4. Date, Fiscal Year and Quarter: May 19 - May 21, 2002; </p><p>FY-02 Third Quarter. </p><p> </p><p>5. Justification and Objective: PAS requested Mr. McNamara\'s </p><p>visit to Jordan to expose Jordanian audiences to an </p><p>assortment of classical guitar and to traditional American </p><p>pieces such as 900 miles/Lily of the West and Old Joe </p><p>Clark/Salt Creek and Somewhere Over the Rainbow by H. Arlen. </p><p>PAS also envisioned introducing the Jordanian public to </p><p>instruments unfamiliar to Jordanians, such as the lute and </p><p>to new musical techniques.  The importance of providing </p><p>insight into the development of music and musical </p><p>instruments over time, as was demonstrated during Mr. </p><p>McNamara\'s program, was also taken into consideration. </p><p> </p><p>6. MPP Objective and Audiences Reached: This program </p><p>supported the MPP goal of promoting Jordanian understanding </p><p>and appreciation of U.S. society, culture and institutions. </p><p>The concerts reached business leaders, academicians, </p><p>artists, students and music lovers from the general public. </p><p> </p><p>7. Result/impact: Very good.  Mr. McNamara is a first-class </p><p>musician.  His performances were wonderful and his friendly </p><p>personality encouraged his audiences to develop a connection </p><p>with his music through his thorough explanation of his songs </p><p>and his instruments.  Mr. McNamara was pleasant in every </p><p>situation and friendly and cooperative with his the </p><p>musicians he worked with and his fans.  The Public Affairs </p><p>staff enjoyed his company and working with him very much. </p><p> </p><p>8. Cost-sharing: The Blue Fig Cafe provided its musical </p><p>venues and technical staff free of charge. </p><p> </p><p>9. Quality of Support: None.  This program was initiated by </p><p>post.
