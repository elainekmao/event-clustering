<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, KPAL, KWBG, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: QUIET IN JORDAN\'S PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS: </p><p>DISGUST WITH ARAFAT FOR "SELLING OUT" </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a July 3 meeting with refcoord, GOJ Department of </p><p>Palestinian Affairs Director-General Abdulkarim Abulhaija </p><p>shed some light on the calm that currently prevails in </p><p>Jordan\'s refugee camps, in spite of continued tensions in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza.  Abulhaija attributed the calm to three </p><p>factors.  First, demonstration fatigue.  Abulhaija said there </p><p>is a sense in the camps that life simply must go on, no </p><p>matter what happens in the Palestinian Territories.  Second, </p><p>a combination of fear and political expediency.  Abulhaija </p><p>said the GOJ had made it very clear in April that the </p><p>security services would react -- "cruelly if necessary" -- to </p><p>maintain stability in Jordan.  With parliamentary elections </p><p>coming, he said, none of Jordan\'s recognized political </p><p>players are willing to earn disfavor by pushing for </p><p>unauthorized demonstrations.  As evidence, Abulhaija noted </p><p>the ease with which trade unions recently cancelled plans for </p><p>a U.S. boycott event after the GOJ made clear that the event </p><p>would not be approved. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Finally, Abulhaija attributed the current calm to </p><p>great popular disgust with Arafat among many residents of </p><p>Jordan\'s refugee camps, who believe Arafat has sold out his </p><p>people.  According to Abulhaija, most Palestinians in Jordan </p><p>view Arafat\'s mild reaction to President Bush\'s June 24 </p><p>Middle East policy speech as blatant self-preservation at the </p><p>expense of the Palestinian people.  They therefore are </p><p>unwilling to take to the streets in support of Arafat. </p><p>Abulhaija added that even the Fatah factions in Jordan, with </p><p>whom he had just met the same morning, "want to see Arafat </p><p>go."  Abulhaija cautioned, however, that popular disgust with </p><p>Arafat does not mean that Palestinians in Jordan would </p><p>embrace a new leader "imposed" by the U.S. or Israel.  He </p><p>predicted that any such leader would ultimately be </p><p>assassinated, plunging the region into long-term instability. </p><p> Abulhaija concluded by rhetorically asking what the U.S. </p><p>hoped to achieve by new Palestinian elections.  Arafat is </p><p>still popular in the Territories, Abulhaija said, and likely </p><p>would win a presidential election.  Where would that leave </p><p>U.S. policy? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  Abulhaija\'s comments on the reasons behind </p><p>the current quiet in the camps and rising popular disdain for </p><p>Arafat ring true to us and echo opinions we have heard from </p><p>across the political spectrum in Jordan.  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
