<p>UNCLAS SANAA 001119 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, AMGT, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: 5/14/03 IBB COURTROOM EXPLOSION: LIKELY A CRIMINAL </p><p>ACT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1105 </p><p> </p><p>1. On May 15, one day after an explosion occurred in the same </p><p>courthouse in Ibb as the recently concluded trail of the </p><p>Jibla hospital murders, more details have emerged that point </p><p>to this incident being a result of a tribal dispute. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Ibb PSO officer al-Kudaimi, told Consular FSN that a </p><p>night-shift military guard allowed the perpetuators to place </p><p>the bomb inside the appeals courtroom the night before the </p><p>incident occurred. The next morning, the bomb went off as the </p><p>judge entered the room, slightly injuring him.  PSO reports </p><p>no other casualties. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Al-Kudaimi reported that nine or ten individuals </p><p>allegedly connected to the attack were arrested and charged </p><p>with disturbing the peace. Further charges will be added </p><p>pending the results of a task-force investigation.  The </p><p>murder trial that was being held in the courtroom where the </p><p>explosion took place was originally held in Yarim, but was </p><p>moved to Ibb for security reasons.  Al-Kudaimi stressed that </p><p>PSO does not believe this is related to any extremist </p><p>activity, and believes that the man\'s fellow tribesmen sought </p><p>revenge for his murder conviction. </p><p> </p><p>4. Ministry of Interior officials told RSO they had no new </p><p>information to report. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment: As more information comes to light, the courtroom </p><p>explosion increasly appears to be the result of a tribal </p><p>dispute and not related to al-Qaeda or other extremist </p><p>activity. There is no indication of a link to the recent </p><p>conviction of the Jibla hospital murderer. End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
