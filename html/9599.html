<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH ON "CAPTIVE NATIONS </p><p>WEEK"; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Africa must resist" the </p><p>      government-controlled Bulawayo-based weekly "Sunday </p><p>      News" dedicated its July 20 editorial to criticizing </p><p>      President George W. Bush for including Zimbabwe on </p><p>      the list of country\'s he said, in a proclamation to </p><p>      mark "Captive Nations Week," were guilty of </p><p>      oppression and human rights abuses.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "On Friday, in the aftermath of his road show in </p><p>      Africa, President George W. Bush demonized Zimbabwe </p><p>      accusing the government of `violence, corruption and </p><p>      mismanagement.\'  When a United States President who </p><p>      came to power through electoral fraud decides to </p><p>      bully an African country from his base in Texas yet </p><p>      he had a golden opportunity to confront Zimbabwe </p><p>      head-on when he toured Africa. . .the world should </p><p>      question his racist convictions.  In a proclamation </p><p>      issued to mark `captive nations week. . .\' the </p><p>      warmongering cowboy directed his rightwing insults </p><p>      at Zimbabwe, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Belarus and </p><p>      Myanmar. . .For Africa, the announcement of this </p><p>      so-called blacklist is a non-event.  That is why </p><p>      Africa refused to be bullied and actually elected </p><p>      President Mugabe Vice-Chairman of the African Union </p><p>      during the meddlesome U. S. leader\'s visit to the </p><p>      continent.  Less than two and a half years after he </p><p>      came to power. . .President Bush has been dismal. </p><p>      Instead of pursuing enlightened policies abroad, he </p><p>      has championed imperial conquest.  Thankfully, </p><p>      Africa has resisted this onslaught." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
