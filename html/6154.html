Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The AK government has highlighted its </p><p>commitment to accelerate privatization, and to realize $4 </p><p>billion in privatization revenue in 2003.  The  feature </p><p>privatization in the first half of 2003 is TEKEL.  This cable </p><p>describes Turkey\'s 70-year old tobacco and spirits giant </p><p>TEKEL, its plans for privatization, and the conflict between </p><p>this privatization and the goal of market liberalization. A </p><p>newly formed tobacco and alcohol regulations board, which is </p><p>supposed to liberalize the markets, consists primarily of </p><p>former TEKEL employees who have a vested interest in </p><p>protecting TEKEL, including in its privatized form, from </p><p>competition.  Parliament helps protect TEKEL by maintaining </p><p>high taxes and trade barriers on competitors.  The GOT </p><p>justifies these measures by saying they are needed to make </p><p>the sale of TEKEL attractive, to ease the pain of job layoffs </p><p>in TEKEL, and to regulate alcohol sales in a Muslim country. </p><p>The reality post-privatization is likely to be GOT exercising </p><p>statist control over these industries, with little to no </p><p>market liberalization gains. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A SNAPSHOT OF THE MONSTER </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) TEKEL is a classic, inefficient parastatal.  First </p><p>founded in 1932 to carry out "monopoly services" concerning </p><p>tobacco, alcoholic drinks, salt, gun powder and explosives, </p><p>it has dominated Turkey\'s market for tobacco and spirits </p><p>sales for 70 years.   TEKEL has 33,000 employees and direct </p><p>subcontractors, and supports hundreds of thousands of tobacco </p><p>farmers who sell tobacco leaf to the company.  TEKEL,s </p><p>market share in Turkey is 69% for cigarettes, 96% in </p><p>alcoholic spirits (TEKEL retains a monopoly on importing </p><p>spirits), and 31% in wine.  With more than 1,300 workers in </p><p>its salt industry establishment, TEKEL has dominated this </p><p>industry as well.  In 2001, TEKEL,s total assets were valued </p><p>at approximately $2.6 billion, its share of Gross National </p><p>Product was approximately 2%, and its contribution to total </p><p>tax revenues collected by the Treasury was about 4.9%, per </p><p>TEKEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In the tobacco sector, which has allowed foreign </p><p>competition since 1991, Philip Morris is currently producing </p><p>41% as many cigarettes as TEKEL despite only having 3% of </p><p>TEKEL\'s cigarette workforce.  (TEKEL is currently producing </p><p>66,000 tons of cigarettes per year compared to Philip </p><p>Morris, 27,000 tons per year.  TEKEL,s cigarette </p><p>establishment employs 7,375 employees in six factories, and </p><p>another 15,628 in its leaf tobacco processing operations. </p><p>Philip Morris, meanwhile, has just one factory in Izmir </p><p>employing 650 people.  The rest of its operations are </p><p>contracted.)  Sakir Karpat, Philip Morris Government </p><p>Relations Manager in Turkey, said that once TEKEL is </p><p>privatized, he envisions its tobacco operation could be run </p><p>with only 2,000 employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) TEKEL,s excessive weight is not entirely the fault </p><p>of its management.  Until early 2002, when Parliament enacted </p><p>legislation officially transferring it to the Privatization </p><p>Administration (PA), TEKEL was required to buy tobacco stocks </p><p>from farmers across the country, often taking in stock that </p><p>it did not need.  TEKEL continues to buy unneeded tobacco, </p><p>even without formal instructions.  This includes a </p><p>substantial amount of tobacco from Southeast Turkey, which is </p><p>considered inferior to tobacco grown along the Aegean coast, </p><p>near Izmir.  As a result, TEKEL currently has 500,000 tons of </p><p>tobacco in warehouse storage, nearly five times its annual </p><p>level of production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Current Status of Privatization </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Ayhan Sarisu, the PA official who oversees the </p><p>TEKEL privatization, told us the PA plans to advertise the </p><p>primary tender for the sale of TEKEL by June 2003, and hopes </p><p>to complete the sale and collect revenue by the end of this </p><p>year.  The PA has to first await final approval of the TEKEL </p><p>privatization plan by the GOT\'s Higher Privatization Council, </p><p>expected shortly, which is a prior condition for completion </p><p>of the IMF 4th Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Sarisu has declared that 100% of TEKEL will be sold </p><p>in two primary block sales:  one for the tobacco operations </p><p>and the other for alcohol.  The tobacco sale will be further </p><p>split into two parts:  the six cigarette factories will </p><p>encompass the June 2003 tender while TEKEL\'s two large </p><p>tobacco leaf processing plants, in Izmir and Diyarbakir, and </p><p>its excess stocks of tobacco will be tendered later this year </p><p>(Sarisu stresses that all sales will be finalized by the end </p><p>of the year).  One of Sarisu\'s top goals is reducing the </p><p>baggage TEKEL currently has to prepare it for sale.  He plans </p><p>to resolve TL 600 trillion (approximately $400 million) worth </p><p>of unpaid tax liens by transferring some of TEKEL,s unused </p><p>real estate assets to the Treasury Undersecretariat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Sarisu realizes that many portions of the TEKEL </p><p>enterprise are unwanted, and worries that any purchaser will </p><p>immediately downsize certain warehouses and distribution </p><p>centers with little regard to the social effects.  Thus, he </p><p>wants to sell TEKEL,s distilleries and six tobacco plants, </p><p>then use the PA authority to close down warehouses and </p><p>distribution centers using a portion of the proceeds from the </p><p>TEKEL sale as severance packages for the displaced workers. </p><p>This would supplement the 2001 World Bank-GOT funded </p><p>&Privatization Social Support Project,8 which provides $250 </p><p>million in severance packages to state employees who lost </p><p>their jobs.  The World Bank funds 70% of this program while </p><p>the GOT funds the remaining 30%. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While Sarisu wants to get rid of TEKEL,s dead </p><p>weight, some industry officials claim that he is not going </p><p>far enough.  Karpat, of Philip Morris, said that if all six </p><p>factories are sold in one block sale, it will severely limit </p><p>the amount of bidders with deep enough pockets to afford a </p><p>bid that might be in excess of $1 billion.  (Karpat said that </p><p>only Philip Morris and British American Tobacco would be able </p><p>to afford all six factories.)  More worrisome for Karpat is </p><p>the reaction of the Competition Authority (CA).  If Philip </p><p>Morris were to purchase TEKEL,s six tobacco factories and, </p><p>thus, acquire TEKEL,s popular brand names, its market share </p><p>would increase from 25% to approximately 85%, possibly </p><p>disqualifying it from purchasing TEKEL.  Sarisu insists this </p><p>is not the case.  He said that the solution for Philip Morris </p><p>is to form a consortium with other tobacco companies so that </p><p>it can delegate parts of the tobacco operations after the </p><p>purchase.  The CA, which was expected to have three of its 11 </p><p>board members replaced by the new AK government on March 5, </p><p>is expected to rule on the TEKEL tender shortly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Privatization\'s Conflict </p><p>with Market Liberalization </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) A separate but related issue is liberalization of </p><p>the alcohol and tobacco markets.  (As a part of the 1996 </p><p>Customs Union between Turkey and the European Union, various </p><p>trade liberalization measures were to be taken, including </p><p>elimination of TEKEL\'s monopoly status for alcoholic beverage </p><p>imports, by 1999.)  Accompanying the legislation that added </p><p>TEKEL into the PA in February 2002 were provisions designed </p><p>to protect TEKEL from competition during the tenders process </p><p>so that the GOT can command a higher price. GOT officials are </p><p>not hiding the motive.  &We did it to protect TEKEL to make </p><p>it more attractive" for potential bidders, the PA\'s Sarisu </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) On the alcohol/spirits side, the key regulatory </p><p>barrier states that, in 2002, only companies whose annual </p><p>production, imports or sales in Turkey exceed 1 million </p><p>liters will be permitted to import, price, and distribute </p><p>their products directly.  All other companies must continue </p><p>to channel their sales, with the exception of whisky and </p><p>champagne, through TEKEL.  This high threshold severely </p><p>curtailed the ability of foreign exporters to enter the </p><p>market independent of TEKEL control last year, as very few </p><p>companies could achieve sales in excess of one million </p><p>liters.  TEKEL itself only imports 400,000 liters of spirits </p><p>annually.  According to the decree, the 1 million liter </p><p>minimum was reduced to 900,000 liters in 2003, and will be </p><p>phased out in increments until 2007, when the Board of </p><p>Ministers will be authorized to eliminate this sales minimum. </p><p> In addition, a number of onerous labeling and certification </p><p>requirements have been implemented in the past year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Similar provisions exist on the tobacco side.  In </p><p>2003, the new legislation requires companies wanting a </p><p>production license to build factories with an annual </p><p>production capacity of at least 2 million cigarettes, which </p><p>translates into approximately 2,000 tons; this once again </p><p>severely limits entry into the market.  The threshold is </p><p>reduced to 1 billion, 800 million cigarettes in 2004, and is </p><p>again phased out in increments until 2007.  In addition, a </p><p>number of new importation taxes will make it more difficult </p><p>for existing tobacco producers such as Philip Morris and for </p><p>any potential newcomers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) TEKEL,s role as a government regulator has been </p><p>transferred to a new alcohol and beverages regulation board. </p><p>Staffing for this board has just begun, with nearly all its </p><p>personnel former TEKEL employees.  The committee will </p><p>eventually be comprised of 240 officials, and fall under a </p><p>7-person Board of Ministers comprised of political appointees </p><p>selected by various GOT ministries.  The chairman of this </p><p>board, Niyazi Adali, is the former Deputy Director General of </p><p>TEKEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Officials of the new regulatory body dismiss </p><p>conflict of interest allegations, claiming that TEKEL </p><p>employees have more experience in the industry than anyone </p><p>else in Turkey.  They say that the harsh restrictions at </p><p>present are a benevolent way of carefully opening up markets </p><p>that have social implications.  Board official Fugen Basmaci, </p><p>a former TEKEL employee of 22 years, commented that TEKEL had </p><p>&a nice history8 since the 1930,s with no counterfeiting </p><p>or health problems.  She said the board is trying to </p><p>liberalize the market, but that &after 70 years, opening the </p><p>doors is difficult.  We are trying to protect the market from </p><p>cheap, unglorified products.8  She added that, in a Muslim </p><p>country, the board needs to be sensitive to how alcohol is </p><p>distributed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Embassy has received complaints about TEKEL\'s </p><p>privatization from U.S. companies in both the distilled </p><p>spirits and tobacco businesses.  In response, Embassy </p><p>officials have raised the issue of protective trade measures </p><p>with the PA and the General Directorate of Tobacco and </p><p>Alcohol.  We have impressed upon the GOT that the current </p><p>laws on import of distilled spirits is inconsistent with free </p><p>market principles, and have requested that they consider </p><p>modifying this law to allow greater transparency and </p><p>competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Offering TEKEL for privatization as planned this </p><p>June will be a good indication of the GOT\'s reform </p><p>commitment, and it will attract serious foreign investor </p><p>interest. However, the various justifications given for </p><p>extending the company\'s monopoly privileges until 2007, a </p><p>lifetime in Turkey, all ring hollow.  They rob the </p><p>privatization of some of the efficiency benefits which would </p><p>otherwise flow.  And as the experience of privatized steel </p><p>plant Kardemir shows (see reftel), industry here, whether </p><p>privatized or not, remains tied to the state, and often acts </p><p>as an instrument of state policy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
