(SBU) Summary: On 12 April 2002, a </p><p>peaceful anti-American demonstration took </p><p>place in Abuja following Friday afternoon </p><p>Jumaat prayers. A group of approximately </p><p>1,000 - 2,000 protestors marched throughout </p><p>central Abuja waiving placards and banners </p><p>that denounced U.S. support for Israel. The </p><p>demonstration culminated at the Federal </p><p>Secretariat, located approximately 4km from </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Embassy, with the burning of a U.S. </p><p>flag. There were no injuries or property </p><p>damage reported. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBUU) Details: At approximately 1515 </p><p>hours on Friday, April 12, 2002, a group of </p><p>approximately 1,000 - 2000 worshipers was </p><p>observed exiting the Abuja Central Mosque </p><p>waiving placards and banners that denounced </p><p>U.S. support for Israel. One of the largest </p><p>banners read "Death to Bush". Flyers were </p><p>also distributed in Hausa that denounced </p><p>U.S. support for Israel and called for the </p><p>Muslim community to condemn this support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Local police and Post\'s SD team </p><p>reported that the demonstrators marched from </p><p>the Abuja Central Mosque past the Sheraton </p><p>hotel and culminated their procession at a </p><p>soccer field behind the Federal Secretariat </p><p>where a brief speech was made by one of the </p><p>organizers and an American flag burned. The </p><p>demonstration ended at approximately 1645 </p><p>hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: Immediately after initial </p><p>notification of the demonstration, the DCM </p><p>convened Post\'s Emergency Action Committee </p><p>(EAC). Since the demonstration was observed </p><p>moving in the general direction of the </p><p>Embassy and there were reports of a vanguard </p><p>headed toward our facilities, Section 1000 </p><p>of Post\'s EAP was invoked. We do not believe </p><p>any demonstrator came within less than 3km </p><p>of the Embassy. The demonstration eventually </p><p>concluded about 4km away. There were no </p><p>injuries or property damage reported. An </p><p>advisory warden message was also sent to </p><p>American citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
