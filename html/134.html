<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 00806 </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPT PASS INR/OIL/B; CAIRO PLS PASS AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S NEW GOVERNOR: FIRST </p><p>IMPRESSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 15935 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS THE </p><p>CHARACTER OF THE NEW MAN ON THE ALEXANDRIA HOT SEAT. </p><p>INITIAL IMPRESSIONS OF GOVERNOR GAWSAQI ARE FAVORABLE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH KEY CONTACTS FEEL HE HAS INSUFFICIENT GRIT </p><p>AND EXPERIENCE FOR THIS VERY TOUGH JOB.  OTHERS CLAIM </p><p>THAT AL GAWSAQI\'S ALLEGED "SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP" WITH </p><p>MUBARAK WILL PAY THE GOVERNORATE MANY DIVIDENDS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  TWO WEEKS AGO, SAYYID ISMAIL AL-GAWSAQI WAS </p><p>APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF ALEXANDRIA (REFTEL).  THE MOVE </p><p>CAME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE (HE IS RELATIVELY UNKNOWN), </p><p>AND HE WAS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED AS BEING IN CONTENTION. </p><p>SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN ALEXANDRIA, AL-GAWSAQI HAS STAYED </p><p>BUSY MEETING WITH GOVERNORATE OFFICIALS AND LEADING </p><p>BUSINESSMEN.  REQUESTS BY FOREIGNERS FOR MEETINGS WITH </p><p>HIM WERE POLITELY, BUT FIRMLY, TURNED ASIDE, UNTIL </p><p>JULY 24 WHEN THE LOCAL CONSULAR CORPS WAS FORMALLY </p><p>INTRODUCED TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (LOU)  THE AFFAIR, CEREMONIAL IN NATURE, HELD NO </p><p>SUBSTANCE ALTHOUGH IT GAVE THE CONSULS AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO ASSESS THE GOVERNOR\'S FLUENCY IN ARABIC, FRENCH, </p><p>AND ENGLISH (HE WAS APOLOGETIC ABOUT HIS ABILITY IN </p><p>THE LATTER TWO BUT GETS ALONG VERY WELL IN BOTH).  HE </p><p>SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP AND HIS </p><p>DESIRE TO SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS AFFLICTING </p><p>ALEXANDRIA. AT THE END OF THE MEETING, THOSE PRESENT </p><p>SHOOK HANDS WITH THE GOVERNOR AS THEY FILED OUT OF HIS </p><p>OFFICE.  I MANAGED TO PLACE MYSELF AT THE END OF THE </p><p>LINE (HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS AMONG MY PROTOCOL CONSCIOUS </p><p>COLLEAGUES) AND, AS A RESULT, WAS ABLE TO HAVE A FEW </p><p>WORDS WITH HIM.  GAWSAQI SAID HE VERY MUCH WANTED TO </p><p>HAVE GOOD COOPERATION WITH THE U.S.  HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>NOT HAD TIME TO STUDY THE DETIALS OF OUR VARIOUS AID </p><p>PROJECTS, BUT HE IS AWARE THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>ALEXANDRIA IS CONSIDERABLE.  HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY </p><p>TO EMPHASIZE THAT HIS DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN TO US, AND </p><p>I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS SINCERE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  FIRST IMPRESSION:  GAWSAQI COMES ACROSS AS A </p><p>SINCERELY EARNEST, HONEST, AND WELL MEANING OFFICIAL. </p><p>SEVERAL OF OUR CONTACTS, HOWEVER, HAVE EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE, GRIT, </p><p>AND "STREET SMARTS" TO TACKLE ALEXANDRIA\'S VARIATED </p><p>SECURITY, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  "GOOD INTEN- </p><p>TIONS DON\'T NECESSARILY MAKE A GOOD GOVERNOR," ONE </p><p>KEY BUSINESSMAN REMINDED US. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  OTHERS POINT OUT THAT GAWSAQI MAY PROVE TO BE </p><p>A MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNOR THAN MANY EXPECT.  THE REASON: </p><p>HIS ALLEGED CLOSE RELATIONS WITH PRESIDENT MUBARAK. </p><p>AS REPORTED REFTEL, GAWSAQI SERVED FOR A TIME IN THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN AIR FORCE.  SEVERAL SOURCES TELL US THAT </p><p>MUBARAK AND GAWSAQI WORKED TOGETHER IN THE EAF ON TWO </p><p>OCCASIONS.  IN THE 1960\'S, DURING THE TENURE OF SIDQI </p><p>MAHMUD AS AIR FORCE COMMANDER, HE   WAS ALLEGEDLY </p><p>EAF LEGAL ADVISOR AND SHARED AN OFFICE WITH MUBARAK </p><p>WHO WAS WORKING AS AN AIDE TO THE COMMANDER (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE HEARD THAT MUBARAK EVER HAD </p><p>SUCH A JOB, AND OUR MEAGER BIO FILES FAIL TO SHED ANY </p><p>FURTHER LIGHT.  PERHAPS INR/B CAN.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT THIS STORY IS APOCRYPHAL, MUBARAK KNEW </p><p>GAWSAQI AGAIN AFTER HE BECAME EAF COMMANDER IN THE </p><p>MID-1970\'S AND WAS APPARENTLY VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS </p><p>ABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ANOTHER STORY WHICH IS CIRCULATING ALSO </p><p>UNDERSCORES  CLOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>MEN:  A FEW YEARS AGO, THE PRESIDENT APPARENTLY WANTED </p><p>TO APPOINT GAWSAQI ATTORNEY GENERAL, A KEY POST IN THE </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM HERE.  THE NOMINATION WAS THWARTED BY THE </p><p>JUDGES REVIEWING THE NOMINATION BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY </p><p>ENERAL MUST, ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN LAW, BE DRAWN FROM </p><p>HE COURT OF CASSATION (ONE OF THE TWO HIGHEST COURTS). </p><p>AWSAQI WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF BENI </p><p>UQAYF.  DURING A VISIT TO THIS GOVERNORATE, MUBARAK </p><p>AS SUPPOSEDLY VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS FRIEND\'S </p><p>DMINISTRATION, AND ON JULY 10 HE REWARDED HIM WITH </p><p>LEXANDRIA. </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INR CAN SHED ON </p><p>GAWSAQI WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  NUMEROUS PHOTOS WERE </p><p>TAKEN DURING THE JULY 24 CONSULAR CORPS PRESENTATION, </p><p>AND WE WILL FORWARD ONE OF THE GOVERNOR AS SOON AS WE </p><p>RECEIVE A COPY.  INR MAY ALSO WISH TO NOTE THAT GAWSAQI </p><p>SERVED A SHORT TIME IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND MAY </p><p>HAVE HAD A BRIEF POSTING IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
