<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 007/02 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VT, UN, terrorism </p><p>SUBJECT: PAPAL ADDRESS FOCUSES ON VIOLENCE, RESPONSIBILITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AND FORGIVENESS </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, POPE JOHN </p><p>PAUL II OFFERED HIS VERSION OF THE STATE OF THE WORLD, </p><p>FOCUSING ON AREAS TRADITIONALLY OF CONCERN TO THE CHURCH. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00180  111548Z </p><p>ESCHEWING FOR THE MOST PART HIS TRADITIONAL EXHORTATION FOR </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO DO MORE FOR THE LESS FORTUNATE, IT </p><p>STRUCK MANY THAT THE PONTIFF EXPRESSED A BALANCED AND </p><p>REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT CONDITIONS AND A GENTLE </p><p>PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EARLY ON, HE OFFERED A COMMENTARY ON EU EXPANSION: HE </p><p>SUPPORTS IT AND INDEED ENCOURAGES MORE, BUT ASSERTS THAT </p><p>EVEN A SECULAR EUROPE MUST ALLOW RELIGIOUS VOICES TO HAVE A </p><p>PLACE IN EU PLANNING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>DISCUSSIONS OF AN EU CONSTITUTION.  HE NOTED PROGRESS IN </p><p>CYPRUS, KOSOVO AND SRI LANKA, AND CONGRATULATED BOTH THE </p><p>PEOPLES REPUBLIC, AND THE REPUBLIC, OF CHINA FOR TAKING </p><p>SEATS AT THE WTO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT HE DECRIED "THE </p><p>INJUSTICE OF WHICH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VICTIMS </p><p>FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS."  HE ADDED THAT ONLY A HALT TO THE </p><p>VIOLENCE AND "RESPECT FOR OTHERS AND THEIR LEGITIMATE </p><p>ASPIRATIONS, THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, AND INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>GUARANTEED STATUS FOR THE MOST HOLY PLACES IN JERUSALEM,.." </p><p>CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE TO WHICH THERE IS APPARENTLY </p><p>NO END.  ALL OF THE ABOVE IS STANDARD VATICAN LANGUAGE -- AS </p><p>WAS HIS EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BE </p><p>ACCEPTED BY ALL PARTIES TO TAKE A ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>(NOTE: WE READ THIS TO INCLUDE COUNTRIES BESIDES THE U.S. IN </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS, TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL MONITORS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE POPE REITERATED HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED </p><p>STATES\' RIGHT TO "LEGITIMATE DEFENSE" AGAINST THE TERRORIST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00180  111548Z </p><p>ATTACKS OF 9/11.  NOTING THE NEED ALSO TO CONSIDER </p><p>STRATEGIES TO COMBAT IT, ADDRESS CAUSAL FACTORS, AND BEGIN A </p><p>HEALING PROCESS, HE OFFERED AN IMPLICIT ENDORSEMENT OF OUR </p><p>CAMPAIGN BY SIMPLY URGING THE KARZAI GOVERNMENT TO MOVE </p><p>QUICKLY TO "PACIFY" ALL OF AFGHANISTAN\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE PONTIFF RESERVED HIS MOST HARSH AND BLUNT CRITICISM </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO WOULD COMMIT VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF GOD.  HE </p><p>CALLED THIS "BLASPHEMY AND A PERVERSION OF RELIGION."   HE </p><p>FURTHER DECRIED TERRORISM "IN THE NAME OF GOD," AS A </p><p>"PROFANATION OF RELIGION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TALK, THE PONTIFF OFFERED BRIEF </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT GAP.  UNLIKE IN PREVIOUS </p><p>ANNUAL ADDRESSES, IN WHICH HE SOUGHT TO STIMULATE THE NORTH </p><p>TO DO MORE FOR THE SOUTH, THIS TIME HE URGED THE POLITICAL </p><p>CLASSES -- IN AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA ESPECIALLY -- TO SET </p><p>ASIDE THEIR GREED AND PARTISAN DIFFERENCE AND TAKE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR BETTERING THEIR OWN SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN CLOSING, THE PONTIFF OFFERED HIS INSIGHTS ON THE </p><p>NATURE OF GOD AND MAN; HE UNDERSCORED THAT, ALONE AMONG THE </p><p>MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS, CHRISTIANITY OFFERS TO THE WORLD </p><p>(AND TO ISLAM IN PARTICULAR) A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH -- THAT TO </p><p>FORGIVE IS DIVINE.  HE HOPED THAT THE JANUARY 24 DAY OF </p><p>PRAYER IN ASSISI WOULD BRING THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD\'S </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS TOGETHER AROUND THE MESSAGE THAT RELIGION </p><p>SHOULD NOT, AND INDEED TODAY CANNOT, BE SPREAD BY FORCE OF </p><p>ARMS. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00180  111548Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00180 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
