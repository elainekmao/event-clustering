Summary.  On Monday, January 13, the UN held its </p><p>first coordination meeting of 2003 on Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>humanitarian crisis among UN agencies, donors and </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) officials.  The large </p><p>number of attendees included July Moyo, the Minister of </p><p>Social Welfare, Labor and Public Works, David </p><p>Parirenyatwa, the Minister of Health and Child Welfare, </p><p>and Sithembiso Nyoni, the Minister of Small and Medium </p><p>Enterprise Development.  This meeting reflected a more </p><p>frank discussion than had occurred in past meetings on </p><p>the humanitarian issues confronting Zimbabwe and, </p><p>hopefully, laid down a number of critical agenda items </p><p>that can be discussed in greater depth in this forum </p><p>over the coming months.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The three GOZ Ministers explained their views on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s main humanitarian challenges for 2003. </p><p>Minister Parirenyatwa listed the challenges as food </p><p>security, water availability, increased malnutrition and </p><p>disease, inadequate essential drugs and vaccines and </p><p>insufficient equipment and staff at hospitals and </p><p>clinics.  Minister Nyoni listed the challenges as </p><p>poverty alleviation, creating jobs, supporting people to </p><p>create their own wealth and engaging young people. </p><p>Comment:  Neither of these two Ministers mentioned the </p><p>policy environment created by the GOZ that has </p><p>contributed substantially to the humanitarian crisis and </p><p>that continues to impede efforts to address the crisis </p><p>in an effective manner.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>3. Minister Moyo acknowledged that the GOZ has not yet </p><p>met to discuss challenges for 2003.  He stated that more </p><p>analysis needs to be conducted on the precise impacts of </p><p>the current drought and work needs to continue to refine </p><p>projections regarding agricultural production for the </p><p>season.  He also stressed that logistical constraints </p><p>continued to be a problem impeding the import of </p><p>sufficient amounts of food. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Minister Moyo then opened the door to a more frank </p><p>discussion of the humanitarian issues confronting </p><p>Zimbabwe in 2003.  He insisted that the GOZ should not </p><p>shy away from the difficult issues.  First, he said </p><p>there was a need to confront allegations that the </p><p>selection of beneficiaries and/or the distribution of </p><p>food was done on a partisan basis.  He also asserted </p><p>that if Zimbabwe is to improve food security, then the </p><p>GOZ and donors need to look at recovery activities in </p><p>the resettlement areas, but he recognized that donors </p><p>have been reluctant to work in these areas.  He also </p><p>acknowledged the need to discuss policy issues, such as </p><p>the GOZ\'s monopoly in grain trading, but said that the </p><p>parties could agree to disagree. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Ambassador Sullivan and UK High Commissioner Brian </p><p>Donnelly both encouraged the Ministers present to </p><p>address the policy issues that impede progress on food </p><p>security.  Also discussing the policy constraints, </p><p>European Commission Ambassador Francesca Mosca asked </p><p>innocently why the GOZ\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB) </p><p>could not simply put food in the supermarkets.  Minister </p><p>Moyo responded that in urban areas food was sold through </p><p>private millers and then to supermarkets, but stated </p><p>that in an environment of scarcity, some of this food </p><p>was sold "through the back door."  Regarding rural </p><p>areas, Moyo asserted that commercial markets would not </p><p>deliver food to remote regions populated by poor people </p><p>and, therefore, the GOZ needed to institute a system of </p><p>central control to ensure that rural areas were not </p><p>denied food.  Moyo also stated that this policy of </p><p>central control for food distribution to rural areas was </p><p>based on the experience of other countries from which </p><p>Zimbabwe had learned, but he did not indicate which </p><p>countries this might be. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Ambassador Sullivan and High Commissioner Donnelly </p><p>also encouraged the Ministers to take steps to address </p><p>the international perception of partisanship and </p><p>misallocations in the GOZ\'s food program based on widely </p><p>reported incidents.  Ambassador Sullivan specifically </p><p>indicated that the UN\'s recently established Information </p><p>and Verification Unit, which was verifying the proper </p><p>distribution of international donor food, was available </p><p>to respond to similar concerns for the GOZ\'s food </p><p>program.  The Ministers did not respond directly to this </p><p>suggestion, but Ambassador Sullivan\'s intervention laid </p><p>the groundwork for further discussion of this critical </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In a follow up meeting the next evening among UN </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance Coordinator Victor Angelo, </p><p>Ambassador Sullivan and USAID Director, Paul Weisenfeld, </p><p>Angelo confirmed that he had fruitful discussions that </p><p>morning with the Ministry of Social Welfare.  The </p><p>Ministry indicated a willingness to allow the UN\'s </p><p>Information and Verification Unit to verify GMB food </p><p>distribution, as long as the work was done jointly with </p><p>Ministry officials.  Also, the Ministry had begun to </p><p>compile a list of anticipated GMB food imports for the </p><p>next several weeks.  Access to this information would </p><p>improve coordination of GOZ and donor food distribution, </p><p>particularly with respect to logistical considerations. </p><p>Equally important, this information could serve as a </p><p>basis for the work of the UN\'s Information and </p><p>Verification Unit. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Ambassador Sullivan also emphasized to Angelo that </p><p>any future donor work in resettlement areas needed to be </p><p>thought through carefully and approved by major donors </p><p>in advance.  Ambassador Sullivan explained that </p><p>humanitarian relief, such as food distribution, could be </p><p>defended in resettlement areas if distributed to the </p><p>most vulnerable populations with need as the operative </p><p>criterion, as long as need was established on the basis </p><p>of objective and verifiable indicators.  Ambassador </p><p>Sullivan stressed, however, that most donors would not </p><p>fund agricultural recovery work in resettlement areas in </p><p>the current political and economic environment. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Comment.  While the GOZ\'s opening to the possibility </p><p>of UN verification of GMB food deliveries is far from </p><p>bankable, it likely reflects the GOZ\'s recognition of </p><p>its inability to meet food demands or to control </p><p>leakages from the GMB system due to corruption and </p><p>diversion.
