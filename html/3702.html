<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001774 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S GOVERNMENT DISMISSES AS INSINCERE MAOIST </p><p>LEADER\'S OFFER OF CEASEFIRE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On September 11 Maoist leader Prachanda issued a </p><p>press statement calling for a ceasefire.  The statement does </p><p>not refer to the U.S. directly, but contains a general </p><p>condemnation of the Government of Nepal (GON) "running to buy </p><p>weapons to kill people."  Should the GON proceed with its </p><p>plan to hold elections, the statement threatens further </p><p>violence.  An unofficial English translation of the release </p><p>follows in Para 3 below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The statement is generally regarded by most </p><p>journalists and media outlets as authentic.  Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba told the Ambassador September 12 that he </p><p>does not regard the offer as sincere, noting that the </p><p>insurgents typically follow up an attack with a spurious </p><p>olive branch.  If and when the Maoists extend a genuine offer </p><p>to cease their violent activities and resume dialogue, Deuba </p><p>said the Government\'s door would be open (septel). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Begin text of unofficial translation: </p><p> </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Central Committee Press </p><p>Statement </p><p> </p><p>Our party has appealed several times to end the present civil </p><p>war through the process of peace talks and a positive </p><p>political solution.  But since the appeal was firmly </p><p>rejected, the revolutionary warriors of the People\'s </p><p>Liberation Army have proved their superiority against the </p><p>hired guns of the feudal power with the successful, brave </p><p>attacks at Sindhuli in the east and Arghakhanchi in the west. </p><p> This military protest has clearly showed the whole nation </p><p>the indomitable and predetermined victory of the great </p><p>people\'s war and the inevitable decline and defeat of the </p><p>feudal murderers.  This nationwide protest is a strong </p><p>expression of the hatred of the masses toward the royal army </p><p>terror.  For the successful and courageous attacks at </p><p>Sindhuli and Arghakhanchi, our party offers a revolutionary </p><p>salute with heartfelt praise to the warriors of the People\'s </p><p>Liberation Army and the masses.  Homage is also offered to </p><p>the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the process of </p><p>revolutionary transformation. </p><p> </p><p>We would like to make it clear that our party, along with </p><p>other political parties, human rights organizations, </p><p>associations, intellectuals and the general public were in </p><p>favor of dialogue and a peaceful political solution.  The </p><p>feudal murderers plotted one conspiracy after another.  The </p><p>dissolution of Parliament and running to buy weapons to kill </p><p>people have made clear the criminal activities of the feudal </p><p>murderers.  In this regard, the state of emergency makes no </p><p>difference to the royal army spreading terror throughout the </p><p>population.  That is why our party has continued its military </p><p>and political programs and activities. </p><p> </p><p>However, if the present ruling power is prepared for a </p><p>positive and peaceful solution, then we are ready for a </p><p>ceasefire and to take part in the process of peace talks. </p><p>But we would also like to make clear that, if the massacre is </p><p>continued under the guise of a mid-term poll and propaganda, </p><p>then we are prepared for stronger military actions.  The </p><p>feudal murderers and their supporters will have to bear the </p><p>responsibility for the result of such action.  We will try to </p><p>solve the problem through a positive political solution to </p><p>avoid such a situation.  But if compelled, we will fight to </p><p>the end. </p><p> </p><p>11 September 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>Chairman </p><p>NCP (Maoist) </p><p> </p><p>End text of unofficial English translation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  We share the PM\'s skepticism about the sincerity of </p><p>this offer.  Prachanda has issued other statements making </p><p>direct and indirect allusions to resuming dialogue that have </p><p>proven hollow.  Maoist attacks over the past week have </p><p>already raised doubts in nearly all quarters that the </p><p>November 13 elections can proceed as scheduled.  The threat </p><p>of even more violence if election preparations proceed could </p><p>make the case for postponing the polls, advocated by some, </p><p>even stronger. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
