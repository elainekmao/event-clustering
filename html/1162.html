(C) UNHCR REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE </p><p>TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON JUNE 20 THAT HE WOULD BE </p><p>DELIVERING THAT DAY A LETTER FROM UNITED NATIONS DEPUTY </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES SOREN JESSEN-PETERSEN TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA THROUGH THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  THE LETTER WILL PRESENT A </p><p>CONCRETE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS, </p><p>AND STATE THAT THE UNHCR HAS IDENTIFIED A COUNTRY FOR </p><p>THEIR IMMEDIATE RESETTLEMENT.  BAJULAIYE WOULD NOT </p><p>IDENTIFY THE COUNTRY BEFORE HE HAD PROPOSED IT TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID THAT HE HOPED THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WOULD REACT QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY, AND </p><p>COUNTED ON HIS PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP WITH ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA TO HELP LUBRICATE THE CUBANS\' </p><p>RELEASE PROCESS.

BY MAKING THE CUBANS SUFFER, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO OTHER </p><p>WOULD-BE DEFECTORS REGARDING THEIR CHOICE OF ZIMBABWE AS </p><p>A JUMPING OFF POINT. </p><p> </p><p>3.
