<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000661 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SPECTRE OF VIOLENCE OVER PLATEAU ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Residents in Plateau State are fearful </p><p>that April 12 and 19 elections will generate violence. </p><p>Disappointed with incumbent PDP Governor Joshua Dariye, </p><p>many are looking to the ANPP and AD candidates for a </p><p>change.  The local elite, political power brokers, workers </p><p>and a disaffected faction of the PDP are all working </p><p>against a Dariye administration widely viewed as </p><p>ineffective and incompetent.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  With gubernatorial races set for April 19, Plateau </p><p>residents are worried that a tight race could spark </p><p>violence.  Governor Joshua Dariye is a sub-par politician </p><p>whose administration of the state\'s affairs leaves much to </p><p>be desired.  He has been combative, refusing to reach out </p><p>to many established personalities and traditional rulers. </p><p>In a state with a pluralistic demography and a strong </p><p>Muslim minority, he has fueled ethnic/religious animosity </p><p>by his strident Christianity.  Although Dariye is weak, he </p><p>could still eke by.  Dariye has been an Obasanjo </p><p>cheerleader and although Obasanjo realizes Dariye\'s </p><p>shortcomings, the President has begrudgingly decided to </p><p>support the Governor.  PDP National Chairman Audu Ogbeh </p><p>told the Ambassador recently that Dariye was "on his knees" </p><p>in his office pleading for his re-nomination.  The ANPP and </p><p>the AD candidates\' inability to present a united anti- </p><p>Dariye front could open the door to his narrow victory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The ANPP\'s Jonah Jang, a retired Air Force </p><p>officer, is supported by many retired general officers who </p><p>call Plateau home.  Jang, an ethnic Birom, also has the </p><p>support of ANPP\'s zonal vice-president and former Abacha </p><p>right-hand retired General Jeremiah Useni.  The AD\'s </p><p>Damishi Sango, a former Minister of Sports, narrowly lost </p><p>the PDP nomination to Dariye in 1999.  At that time, he </p><p>showed party loyalty by encouraging his supporters to back </p><p>Dariye.  But since then, Sango had fallen out with both </p><p>Obasanjo and Dariye.  Finding the grass greener in the AD, </p><p>Sango feels he can win back what he narrowly lost in 1999. </p><p>Plateau political broker and former PDP national chairman </p><p>Solomon Lar dislikes Dariye and is apparently supporting </p><p>Sango. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Complaints about the current administration are </p><p>widespread.  State employees have not been paid for months; </p><p>many resort to hiring out their personal vehicles for </p><p>commercial activities in order to survive.  To make matters </p><p>worse, Dariye clumsily stated last year that the "payment </p><p>of salaries is not a priority of my administration."  This </p><p>was not a statement that endeared the Governor to those who </p><p>vote.  Critics claim that no single state or federal </p><p>project instituted by Dariye has been commissioned during </p><p>his term of office.  With its increased population, the </p><p>capital city Jos has a water problem that Dariye has been </p><p>unable to conquer or suggest a plausible solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Dariye\'s unpopularity is such that he actually may </p><p>be hurting Obasanjo\'s prospects in Plateau.  During a </p><p>recent campaign visit, ANPP Presidential Candidate </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari arrived by road from neighboring Bauchi </p><p>state and encountered crowds on the way to Jos.  Dariye\'s </p><p>security operatives intercepted the motorcade at the edge </p><p>of town and tried to divert the vehicles away from </p><p>downtown.  According to witnesses, the crowd lifted </p><p>Buhari\'s Land Rover and carried it over the roadblocks.  At </p><p>this point, the security forces relented and Buhari\'s </p><p>entourage was allowed to pass through central Jos, where </p><p>the streets were lined with thousands of onlookers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Allegations of Dariye\'s efforts to stack the </p><p>elections in his favor abound.  Detractors claim he has </p><p>allegedly bribed many INEC officials and security agents to </p><p>ensure his victory on election day.  One INEC official was </p><p>reportedly removed from Plateau state for refusing to </p><p>cooperate.  Opponents claim that Dariye has also vetted the </p><p>voters lists, removing names of his opponents\' supporters. </p><p>ANPP officials claim that Dariye was behind an effort to </p><p>remove other candidates\' names from the voters list, </p><p>rendering them ineligible.  While that failed, questions </p><p>about the voters list remain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  In the past, Plateau State had been a </p><p>model of ethnic and religious diversity, social tolerance </p><p>and harmony.  In the last two years, Plateau and its </p><p>capital, Jos, have become synonymous with communal </p><p>violence.  Governor Dariye has been ineffectual in </p><p>arresting this descent and may be a contributing factor to </p><p>his state\'s demise.  Because of his poor track record, his </p><p>re-election is far from assured.  He may also have saddled </p><p>President Obasanjo with many of his troubles in Plateau. </p><p>Support for Buhari signifies that victory in Plateau is not </p><p>guaranteed for Obasanjo.  However, Obasanjo is banking on </p><p>the Christian majority sticking with him, support from the </p><p>AD, and the power of incumbency to prevail. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
