(SBU) SUMMARY: DURING A MARCH 26 CONFERENCE HOSTED BY </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRIVACY AUTHORITY, CHAIRMAN STEFANO RODOTA </p><p>AND SECRETARY GENERAL GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI EXPRESSED </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERN REGARDING CONTINUED U.S.-EU DIVERGENCE IN </p><p>PRIVACY PROTECTION. PASSENGER NAME RECORD (PNR) AND SAFE </p><p>HARBOR WERE SINGLED OUT AS MATTERS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. </p><p>RODOTA AND BUTTARELLI ALSO CRITICIZED THE EU COMMISSION </p><p>FOR APPROVING THE PNR AGREEMENT WITHOUT ADEQUATE </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH EU PRIVACY AUTHORITIES AND POLITICAL </p><p>LEVEL OFFICIALS.  IN A SEPARATE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>ECON, SECRETARY GENERAL BUTTARELLI ALSO EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT REGARDING THE PERCEIVED LACK OF FOLLOW-UP </p><p>BY THE USG TO A MARCH 2002 EU PRIVACY VISIT (LED BY </p><p>ITALY) TO THE U.S.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>EU-U.S. AT ODDS ON PRIVACY PROTECTION AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) AT A MARCH 26 CONFERENCE HOSTED BY THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRIVACY AUTHORITY, CHAIRMAN STEFANO RODOTA (WHO ALSO </p><p>HEADS THE EU ARTICLE 29 PRIVACY AUTHORITIES\' WORKING </p><p>GROUP) UNDERSCORED THAT TRADITIONALLY THE EU AND THE U.S. </p><p>HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACHES TOWARDS PRIVACY </p><p>PROTECTION.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER 11TH, U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01528  01 OF 02  100607Z </p><p>"DEMANDS" TO ACCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION, "ALTHOUGH BASED </p><p>ON UNDERSTANDABLE SECURITY CONCERNS", ARE NOW AT COMPLETE </p><p>ODDS WITH ROOTED EU PRIVACY BELIEFS, HE ARGUED.  HE USED </p><p>PNR AS THE CASE STUDY EXAMPLE IN WHICH U.S. AND EU </p><p>POSITIONS DIVERGE COMPLETELY.  RODOTA BELIEVES THE PNR </p><p>AGREEMENT NEEDS A THOROUGH REVIEW, AND EXPRESSED HOPE </p><p>THAT A COMPROMISE SOLUTION MIGHT BE FOUND ON PNR IN ORDER </p><p>TO AVOID A U.S.-EU "PRIVACY CRISIS." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>COMMISSION LACKS PRIVACY CULTURE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) RODOTA AND BUTTARELLI WERE ALSO CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>EU "BUREAUCRATS" WHO SIGNED THE ORIGINAL PNR AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE U.S. RODOTA MAINTAINED THAT SUCH "BUREAUCRATS" </p><p>STILL DO NOT APPRECIATE PRIVACY CONCERNS SUFFICIENTLY. </p><p>BUTTARELLI SEPARATELY TOLD US THAT COMMISSION OFFICIALS </p><p>PROCEEDED WITHOUT ADEQUATE CONSULTATIONS WITH PRIVACY </p><p>AUTHORITIES, NOR DID THEY COORDINATE AT THE POLITICAL </p><p>LEVEL. HE INDICATED THAT EU COMMISSION OFFICIALS MADE A </p><p>HUGE MISTAKE.  "SOME OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE HAVE ALREADY </p><p>BEEN REASSIGNED," HE SAID, SINCE THE AGREEMENT VIOLATES </p><p>NATIONAL PRIVACY LAWS AND IS ILLEGAL AND INAPPLICABLE. </p><p>PROOF, PER BUTTARELLI, IS THE RECENT OVERWHELMING </p><p>MAJORITY VOTE IN THE EU PARLIAMENT CALLING FOR REVISION </p><p>OF THE PNR AGREEMENT. "WE ARE NEGOTIATING NOW WHAT SHOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED SIX MONTHS AGO" BUTTARELLI SAID. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SAFE HARBOR - "WE WANT INFORMATION" </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01528  01 OF 02  100607Z </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) REGARDING SAFE HARBOR, WHILE EXPRESSING SOME </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH HOW IT IS FUNCTIONING, RODOTA AND </p><p>BUTTARELLI ALSO ARGUED THAT SAFE HARBOR NEEDS TO BE </p><p>COMPLEMENTED BY CONTRACTUAL PROTECTION AGREEMENTS. RODOTA </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE UPCOMING SAFE HARBOR REVIEW WILL BE </p><p>KEY IN ASSESSING ITS SUCCESS AND CONTINUATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) IN OUR SEPARATE CONVERSATION, BUTTARELLI ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT REGARDING LACK OF FOLLOW-UP </p><p>TO A MARCH 2002 RODOTA-LED EU PRIVACY DELEGATION TO THE </p><p>U.S.  HE DESCRIBED THE VISIT AS VERY PROMISING AND NOTED </p><p>THAT OPEN DIALOGUE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED.  HOWEVER, </p><p>ACCORDING TO BUTTARELLI, NOTWITHSTANDING TWO LETTERS SENT </p><p>BY RODOTA (ONE IN JULY 2002 AND A SECOND IN EARLY 2003) </p><p>REQUESTING FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION, U.S. AGENCIES SUCH AS </p><p>FTC, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>COMMERCE, AND PRIVATE BB-ONLINE HAVE YET TO RESPOND. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3478 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01528  02 OF 02  100607Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIP-00   EB-00    UTED-00  FTC-01   TEDE-00  STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  USPS-01  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------53665A  100608Z /32 </p><p>R 100540Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9190 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS FTC </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/CIP </p><p>USDOC 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD, EUN, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: HEAD OF ITALIAN PRIVACY AUTHORITY CRITICAL OF </p><p>PNR AGREEMENT AND CONCERNED ABOUT SAFE HARBOR APPLICATION </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01528  02 OF 02  100607Z </p><p>BUTTARELLI MAINTAINS THAT SUCH FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION IS </p><p>KEY TO THE ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SAFE HARBOR </p><p>AGREEMENT. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MORE AND MORE </p><p>COMPANIES ARE ADHERING TO SAFE HARBOR, BUTTARELLI SEES </p><p>THIS SYSTEM AS STILL THIN AND NEEDING </p><p>IMPROVEMENT/REVISION.  HE INDICATED THAT COMMERCE UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY GRANT ALDONAS HAS PROPOSED A VIDEO CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN MAY BUT, THAT WHILE THIS IS WELCOME, HE VIEWS IT AS </p><p>INSUFFICIENT.  BUTTARELLI ALSO UNDERSCORED RODOTA\'S </p><p>PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE LETTERS HE HAD SIGNED </p><p>PERSONALLY HAD RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED: WE WOULD APPRECIATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>UPDATING EMBASSY REGARDING REVIEW AND POSSIBLE RESPONSE </p><p>TO RODOTA\'S LETTERS.  RODOTA IS HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN </p><p>THE GOI AND AMONG PRIVACY OFFICIALS EU-WIDE.  HE IS ALSO </p><p>A CLOSE CONTACT OF THE EMBASSY.  RODOTA IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>PLAY AN INFLUENTIAL ROLE ON PRIVACY-RELATED ISSUES DURING </p><p>ITALY\'S UPCOMING EU PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>EU "WHITE LIST" GROWING BUT SOME CONCERN IN-HOUSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) RODOTA AND BUTTARELLI EXPRESSED SATISFACTION </p><p>THAT THE COUNTRIES ON THE EU\'S PRIVACY WHITE LIST (I.E., </p><p>THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MOVING TOWARDS A EUROPEAN </p><p>STANDARD OF REGULATED PRIVACY PROTECTION) IS RAPIDLY </p><p>EXPANDING "TO ALSO INCLUDE CANADA AND SOME AFRICAN </p><p>STATES."  ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME CONCERN EXISTS WITH THE </p><p>"SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SATISFACTORY" COORDINATION/ATTENTION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01528  02 OF 02  100607Z </p><p>WITHIN THE EU AND WITH THE EU COMMISSION ON PRIVACY </p><p>ISSUES.  NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU PRIVACY </p><p>DIRECTIVE VARIES CONSIDERABLY AMONG MEMBER STATES.  SOME </p><p>NATIONAL LAWS, RODOTA ARGUED, ARE TOO PERMISSIVE AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY COULD DRIVE EU PRIVACY PROTECTION STANDARDS </p><p>DOWNWARDS. (NOTE: THE LATTER POINT REGARDING PRIVACY </p><p>COORDINATION AND PROTECTION LEVELS AMONG MEMBER STATES </p><p>WAS LARGELY PLAYED DOWN BY BUTTARELLI IN OUR PRIVATE </p><p>CONVERSATION.  HOWEVER, HE DID CONFIRM THAT PRIVACY LAWS </p><p>VARY - AND WITH THEM LEVELS OF PRIVACY PROTECTION - AMONG </p><p>EU COUNTRIES). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) WHILE ITALIAN PRIVACY COMMISSION AUTHORITIES </p><p>HAVE FREQUENTLY CRITICIZED U.S. STANDARDS OF PRIVACY </p><p>PROTECTION, THEIR DIRECT CRITICISM OF EU COMMISSION </p><p>"BUREAUCRATS" WHO DO NOT HAVE A "PRIVACY CULTURE" IS </p><p>UNUSUAL. THEY CLEARLY VIEW THE DIFFERENT APPROACH TAKEN </p><p>BY MEMBER STATES REGARDING PRIVACY PROTECTION AS A THREAT </p><p>TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTION TO WHICH RODOTA </p><p>AND BUTTARELLI ASPIRE.  WE CAN EXPECT THAT THE PRIVACY </p><p>COMMISSION WILL TRY TO USE ITALY\'S UPCOMING EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>TO PRESS OTHER MEMBER STATES TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS OF PRIVACY PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01528  02 OF 02  100607Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01528 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
