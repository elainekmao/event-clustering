<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, PRM: RMACKLER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, NP, BH, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: UNHCR BRIEFING ON BHUTANESE REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1219 (B) KATHMANDU 1139 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a briefing to the donor community in </p><p>Nepal on June 30, UNHCR Country Director Abraham Abraham </p><p>expressed strong concern over the results of the verification </p><p>of the first camp of Bhutanese refugees.  These results, he </p><p>said, present "serious difficulties" for some refugee </p><p>families.  Refugee demonstrations against the verification </p><p>report continued through June 23; Abraham confirmed Maoist </p><p>student wing involvement in the protests.  A majority of the </p><p>camp\'s residents are expected to file appeals by the July 2 </p><p>deadline.  UNHCR has no indication of how many Khundunabari </p><p>camp residents will choose to return to Bhutan voluntarily, </p><p>although Abraham expected that preliminary numbers would be </p><p>available by late-August, one month before repatriation </p><p>occurs.  Abraham confirmed that UNHCR is not inclined to </p><p>support continued funding of the Khundunabari camp after </p><p>repatriation even if refugees remain for local resettlement. </p><p>Abraham has approached the Government of Nepal (GON) on </p><p>developing a strategy to resettle refugees who do not wish to </p><p>return to Bhutan, but GON responses have been noncommittal. </p><p>UNHCR will continue to seek approval for its involvement in </p><p>verification and repatriation and hopes that donor </p><p>governments will do the same.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) UNHCR Country Director Abraham Abraham invited all </p><p>diplomatic mission representatives for a briefing on June 30 </p><p>regarding the Bhutanese refugee situation, the status of the </p><p>19 Tibetan refugees detained June 24 (Ref A), and an update </p><p>on UNHCR\'s protection program against gender-based violence </p><p>(septel).  Along with Ambassador Malinowski, the German, </p><p>French and Danish Chiefs of Mission, UK Charge and </p><p>representatives from the EU, Japan, Canada and the World Food </p><p>Program attended the briefing. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Khundunabari Camp Verification Report </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Abraham reported that UNHCR has agreed to meet with </p><p>GON and Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) officials to </p><p>discuss implementation of the bilateral program despite the </p><p>absence of UNHCR involvement in the verification process. </p><p>Abraham expressed "deep concern" about inconsistencies in the </p><p>Joint Verification Team\'s (JVT) Khundunabari Camp report </p><p>released June 18 (Ref B). The results present "serious </p><p>difficulties" for refugee families, he said.  Abraham </p><p>confirmed reports that families have been split between </p><p>categories.  In some cases, parents are in Category III </p><p>(non-Bhutanese) and therefore ineligible for repatriation </p><p>whereas their children are in Category II (Bhutanese who </p><p>voluntarily departed) and are eligible for repatriation. </p><p>There are also cases where children as young as three years </p><p>old have been categorized as criminals (Category IV) along </p><p>with their parents.  (Note.  Category III refugees </p><p>(non-Bhutanese) are expected to return to their home country </p><p>while those in Category IV (Bhutanese criminals) can return </p><p>to Bhutan, but would face criminal charges.  End Note.)  The </p><p>Nepalese Foreign Ministry Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya later </p><p>admitted to Abraham that categorizing children as criminals </p><p>had been a mistake.  Although Acharya did not detail how this </p><p>would be prevented, Abraham was hopeful that future </p><p>verifications would be more sensitive to the issue.  Abraham </p><p>cited the need to conduct a complete and simultaneous </p><p>verification of the remaining six camps.  A complete </p><p>verification is necessary to allow the GON and other donor </p><p>countries to move forward with other resettlement options, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Refugee Staged Protests, But Now All Is Calm </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Following the release of the JVT report on June 18, </p><p>camp residents were calm, perhaps in a state of shock, </p><p>Abraham said.  However, the following morning, demonstrations </p><p>involving almost the entire 12,000 residents of Khundunabari </p><p>Camp and significant numbers in other camps occurred </p><p>throughout the day of June 19.  On June 20, refugee students, </p><p>complaining that the camp\'s organizing committee was not </p><p>doing enough to promote the refugees\' cause, attempted to </p><p>take over the World Refugee Day celebrations.  However, camp </p><p>security stayed away from the students and allowed the </p><p>refugee leaders and UNHCR officials to defuse the situation. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On June 21, approximately 300 adult refugees left </p><p>the camp to demonstrate in the nearby community.  Hundreds </p><p>more refugee students also left the camps to demonstrate in </p><p>front of the JVT building in nearby Damak.  Threatening to </p><p>arrest the refugees, security forces called upon the UNHCR </p><p>and other NGOs to talk to the protesters and encourage them </p><p>to return to the camps. (Note: Although the tenor of the </p><p>demonstrations were non-violent, the refugees were breaking </p><p>two Nepali laws, one requiring refugees to obtain permission </p><p>before leaving the camps and the other requiring permission </p><p>before staging a public protest.  End Note.)  Demonstrations </p><p>continued on June 22 and 23 with reports of only small </p><p>skirmishes between students and security forces.  Refugee </p><p>students reportedly threatened refugee leaders in the camp </p><p>and accused them of selling-out to the JVT.  However, after a </p><p>meeting with UNHCR officials on June 23, most refugees turned </p><p>their attention to filing appellate applications. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) UNHCR officials confirmed reports that the Maoist </p><p>student wing ANNISU-R was involved in motivating and </p><p>organizing the Bhutanese refugee student union protest.  Two </p><p>ANNISU-R leaders, Govinda Thapa and Govinda Koirala, were </p><p>seen in front of the JVT building in Damak on the day of the </p><p>protest.  Rumors abound that ANNISU-R bankrolled the refugee </p><p>students\' transportation to and from Damak, but are </p><p>unsubstantiated.  Security forces in Damak reported that the </p><p>next time any ANNISU-R leaders appear in front of the JVT </p><p>building, the police would arrest them. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Majority of Refugees File Appeals </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The UNHCR has made it clear to the GON that the </p><p>rules governing the appeal process are unacceptable.  Abraham </p><p>specifically pointed to the fact that appeals must be made to </p><p>the original adjudication body.  Such a body is not likely to </p><p>reverse its previous decision, he said.  Abraham has raised </p><p>this problem with both Prime Minister Thapa, who agreed to </p><p>look into it, and the Indian Ambassador to Nepal, who agreed </p><p>to discuss the issue with both the GON and RGOB.  In </p><p>addition, refugees must submit new documentation or </p><p>information in order to have their appeal heard.  However, </p><p>few, if any, refugees will have new documentation to provide </p><p>the JVT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The appeal process is currently the issue of </p><p>greatest concern to the refugees.  Many refugees had </p><p>boycotted the appeal process; only five appeals had been </p><p>submitted within the first week.  However, after UNHCR </p><p>officials explained to the refugees that this was their one </p><p>chance to file a formal protest to the JVT, nearly all </p><p>Khundunabari camp residents rushed to complete the appellate </p><p>application before the July 2 deadline.  At the refugees\' </p><p>request, UNHCR has made a photocopier available to enable the </p><p>refugees to submit the application properly. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>The Way Forward:  UNHCR Involvement Remains Unlikely </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>9. (C) Abraham reported briefly on UNHCR Asia and Pacific </p><p>Director Fakhouri\'s June 24-26 visit to Bhutan.  He said that </p><p>the RGOB has remained adamant against a UNHCR presence in </p><p>Bhutan and, therefore, UNHCR will not be involved in the </p><p>repatriation or resettlement program.  Abraham also confirmed </p><p>that Fakhouri was able to dispel concerns that camps and </p><p>barracks under construction in southern Bhutan will be used </p><p>for refugee resettlement.  However, Abraham seemed skeptical </p><p>that these camps had been built for displaced persons in </p><p>advance of a possible military crackdown on Indian </p><p>separatists in Southern Bhutan, as the RGOB has claimed. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The UNHCR has received no indication on the numbers </p><p>of Khundunabari Camp residents who will return voluntarily to </p><p>Bhutan under existing conditions.  Abraham said that the </p><p>refugees desire an international presence for their </p><p>protection in Bhutan, implying that without that protection, </p><p>some refugees may decide to apply for resettlement in Nepal </p><p>or abroad.  UNHCR will continue to look for a window of </p><p>opportunity to become involved, he said.  However, UNHCR will </p><p>support only a full, voluntary and monitored repatriation to </p><p>the refugees\' home areas.  Abraham expressed frustration with </p><p>the current situation, citing a 2-page long list of questions </p><p>submitted by refugees inquiring about conditions in Bhutan, </p><p>for which UNHCR has been unable to provide answers.  Without </p><p>UNHCR oversight in Bhutan, Abraham said, residents of the </p><p>other six refugee camps will have to rely on repatriated </p><p>Khundunabari Camp refugees to provide information regarding </p><p>conditions in Bhutan. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  Abraham reported that he recently met with Foreign </p><p>Secretary Acharya on developing a local resettlement program </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>for the refugees not returning to Bhutan.  However, Acharya </p><p>was noncommittal, saying only that the GON would take up that </p><p>discussion after repatriation begins in September.  The GON </p><p>does not want to bias refugees\' decisions to return to Bhutan </p><p>by offering local resettlement, Abraham said.  Abraham has </p><p>also raised this issue with Prime Minister Thapa, who </p><p>indicated that discussions on local settlement could begin </p><p>after the Fifteenth Nepal-Bhutan Joint Ministerial taking </p><p>place August 11-14.  The August Ministerial will decide on </p><p>the logistical details of repatriation and resettlement, </p><p>including a final passenger manifest that will help determine </p><p>how many refugees might seek to stay in Nepal.  Abraham </p><p>suggested that donor governments should consider assisting </p><p>the GON with a local resettlement program, especially since </p><p>UNHCR is not inclined to keep Khundunabari Camp open after </p><p>repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Abraham concluded the briefing by saying that UNHCR </p><p>is making every effort to dispel the RGOB\'s suspicions of </p><p>UNHCR and to remain engaged in the process.  But progress has </p><p>been slow and difficult, particularly since the RGOB contends </p><p>that UNHCR has encouraged the refugees to demonstrate against </p><p>the JVT results for Khundunabari Camp.  The World Food </p><p>Program representative commented that WFP has a presence in </p><p>Bhutan and has offered the RGOB assistance for the </p><p>resettlement of the refugees.  Although the RGOB has not </p><p>accepted the offer, it did not decline it outright, she </p><p>reported. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Despite the political, social and economic </p><p>uncertainties, Post predicts that most Khundunabari Camp </p><p>residents in Category II (8,595 people or 70.5 percent) will </p><p>choose to return to Bhutan in hopes of resuming a normal </p><p>life.  Post expects information from the returnees on current </p><p>conditions in Bhutan will begin trickling back to camps in </p><p>Nepal soon after repatriation.  This information will </p><p>strongly influence the six remaining camp refugees\' decisions </p><p>on whether to return to Bhutan or apply for resettlement </p><p>elsewhere.  Without international monitoring, it will be </p><p>impossible to confirm or dispel negative impressions of </p><p>conditions in Bhutan, which could discourage further </p><p>repatriation to Bhutan.  Although it remains unlikely that </p><p>the RGOB will allow UNHCR to play a role in the reintegration </p><p>of the refugees in Bhutan, Post will continue to press for </p><p>its involvement.  Post believes it would still be useful to </p><p>demarche Bhutanese donor capitals on the need to pressure the </p><p>RGOB, prior to the 15th Joint Ministerial on August 11, to </p><p>allow for international participation in the repatriation </p><p>process.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
