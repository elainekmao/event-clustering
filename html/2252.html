<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GABORONE 003732 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: (12/3/2006) </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MOGAE ON MUGABE: HE WILL STAY IN POWER "BY </p><p>HOOK OR BY CROOK" </p><p> </p><p>REF: GABORONE 3681 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN E. LANGE FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PRESIDENT FESTUS MOGAE (PROTECT) BELIEVES THERE </p><p>IS NO CHANCE TO INFLUENCE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT ROBERT </p><p>MUGABE TO HOLD FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS BY MARCH.  HE </p><p>SAID MUGABE IS ACTING LIKE A "WOUNDED BUFFALO" AND IT </p><p>WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE THE ELECTIONS SOONER RATHER THAN </p><p>LATER TO LESSEN THE HARM THAT IS BEING DONE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE ISSUE OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>DURING A 12/1 DINNER AT WHICH MAURICE TEMPELSMAN AND THE </p><p>HARVARD AIDS INSTITUTE BESTOWED THEIR 2001 AIDS </p><p>LEADERSHIP AWARD ON MOGAE.  MOGAE AVERTED THAT MUGABE </p><p>DOES NOT CARE WHAT ANY OUTSIDERS THINK AND WILL STAY IN </p><p>POWER "BY HOOK OR BY CROOK."  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION </p><p>AS TO WHETHER THERE WOULD BE FURTHER SADC ENGAGEMENT </p><p>WITH MUGABE AND HIS GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO THE MARCH </p><p>ELECTIONS, MOGAE SAID THERE PROBABLY WOULD BE MEETINGS </p><p>BUT HE SAW NO CHANCE OF SUCCESS.  IN PAST SADC </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON ZIMBABWE, HE SAID HE HAD LED THE </p><p>DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC CONCERNS AND WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI.  NOW, HE SAID (ONLY HALF-JOKINGLY) THAT </p><p>THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE MUGABE FROM POWER WOULD BE TO </p><p>ATTACK MILITARILY AND REMOVE HIM FORCEFULLY.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED A SCENARIO IN WHICH MUGABE AND </p><p>ZANU-PF WERE SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY LOSE </p><p>THE ELECTIONS DESPITE ALL OF THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION IN ADVANCE.  MOGAE RESPONDED THAT MUGABE IS </p><p>VERY SMART AND IS ALREADY WORKING TO PREVENT THAT </p><p>POSSIBILITY, INCLUDING THROUGH HIS LATEST EFFORT TO </p><p>DISENFRANCHISE THOSE ZIMBABWEANS LIVING ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) THE CONVERSATION THEN TURNED TO THE IMPACT ON </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE CONTINENT AS A WHOLE.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF NEPAD, WHICH </p><p>EMPHASIZES AFRICA\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE, </p><p>COULD BE UNDERCUT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE STOLEN.  MOGAE </p><p>DISMISSED THE IMPORTANCE OF NEPAD, WHICH HE VIEWS AS </p><p>BROAD RHETORIC HAVING LITTLE REAL IMPACT ON THE GROUND. </p><p>HE SAID THE COB HAS GONE ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM BECAUSE </p><p>IT AGREES WITH THE GOALS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS LOW </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED MOGAE IF HE FORESAW STRONG </p><p>MEASURES BY SADC, POSSIBLY EVEN INCLUDING EXPULSION, </p><p>SHOULD THE ELECTIONS TURN OUT AS BADLY AS MANY PREDICT. </p><p>MOGAE WAS UNCERTAIN ABOUT SADC PROCEDURES IN SUCH A CASE </p><p>BUT ADDED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S "APOLOGISTS" (UNNAMED) WOULD </p><p>ARGUE THAT THE SITUATIONS IN SADC MEMBER STATES ANGOLA </p><p>AND THE DRC WERE SUCH THAT ZIMBABWE DID NOT MERIT BEING </p><p>SINGLED OUT FOR EXPLUSION FROM THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT.  MOGAE\'S VIEWS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE </p><p>PESSIMISM EXPRESSED TO US EARLIER BY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MERAFHE (REFTEL).  MOGAE BRIDLES AT THE MEMORY OF BEING </p><p>BERATED BY THE "WAR VETERANS" DURING THE SADC TASK FORCE </p><p>VISIT TO ZIMBABWE ON SEPTEMBER 9.  DESPITE OUR EFFORTS </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT, THE COB NOW </p><p>SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE PROSPECTS OF INFLUENCING </p><p>MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
