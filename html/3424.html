End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A high-profile court case involving Anuruddha </p><p>Ratwatte, the former Defense Minister and a relative of </p><p>President Kumaratunga, will come to trial on August 9. </p><p>(Note:  Ratwatte played key roles in formulating GSL </p><p>military strategy in the 1990\'s and also was a key </p><p>organizer for the People\'s Alliance party.  He remains a </p><p>senior MP.)  Ratwatte and two of his sons have been </p><p>accused of conspiracy to commit the murder of ten Muslim </p><p>campaign workers on election day December 5, 2001. </p><p>Working under the alleged overall direction of Ratwatte, </p><p>a handful of former soldiers and political supporters </p><p>have been accused of murdering the Muslims.  The murders </p><p>occurred near Kandy in central Sri Lanka in an area </p><p>known as Udatalawinna.  The murders sparked </p><p>demonstrations by Muslims throughout Sri Lanka and led </p><p>to several days of nationwide curfews. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Reacting in part to deep Muslim concern about </p><p>the murders, the government has been careful not to </p><p>block the investigation into Ratwatte\'s alleged </p><p>involvement in the case.  In an August 1 discussion with </p><p>poloff, Vijith Malagoda, Senior State Counsel of the </p><p>Attorney General\'s (AG) Office, stated that the </p><p>prosecution of the case against Ratwatte was unique </p><p>because the AG had direct access to the ongoing Criminal </p><p>Investigation Division (CID) findings concerning the </p><p>incident.  In most cases in the past involving high- </p><p>profile personages of whatever political stripe, the </p><p>AG\'s office has been prohibited from becoming involved </p><p>until the police investigation was complete, at which </p><p>time the prosecution would be based solely on the final </p><p>report from the CID.  In this case, however, the GSL has </p><p>made sure that the CID is fully cooperating with the </p><p>AG\'s office in constructing the case against Ratwatte. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a bid to prevent any effort to unduly </p><p>influence the jury and tamper with witnesses, the </p><p>Colombo High Court has agreed to the AG\'s request to </p><p>hold a trial-at-bar in the Ratwatte case.  This decision </p><p>will allow the court to replace the jury with three high </p><p>court judges who will hear the case at an accelerated </p><p>pace and then decide on the verdict.  After the trial- </p><p>at-bar is completed, decisions can be appealed to the </p><p>Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Human rights observers have commented </p><p>that Ratwatte and his sons will likely face a real </p><p>trial, unlike previous cases against individuals of </p><p>prominence.  In the past, the government in power </p><p>usually did its level best to allow well-known </p><p>individuals (of whatever party) to get off the hook. </p><p>This practice led to accusations that there was a </p><p>climate of impunity involving human rights matters.  The </p><p>GSL seems intent on changing this unfortunate record, </p><p>despite complaints from opposition ranks that it is </p><p>using the case to harass Ratwatte.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
