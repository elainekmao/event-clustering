<p>S E C R E T MADRID 05480 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINR, PREL, SP, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI RETALIATES AGAINST SPANISH EXPULSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) MADRID 5426, B) MADRID 5425, C) MADRID 5418 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) LIBYA MAY 12 RESPONDED TO FRIDAY\'S EXPULSION OF </p><p>ITS CONSUL GENERAL, CHARGED WITH PASSING FUNDS TO </p><p>A SPANISH ARMY COLONEL ON THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC RIGHT, </p><p>BY PNG\'ING THE SPANISH COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL </p><p>COUNSELORS IN TRIPOLI.  MFA\'S SUBDIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>NORTH AFRICA TELLS US THAT THE GOS WILL NOT RETALIATE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE EXPULSIONS; AS INVESTIGATIONS </p><p>CONTINUE INTO THE LIBYAN ACTIVITIES HERE, HOWEVER, </p><p>MORE EXPULSIONS ARE QUITE POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AFTER THIS MESSAGE WAS DRAFTED, WE RECEIVED </p><p>A WIRE SERVICE REPORT QUOTING INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>BARRIONUEVO SAYING THAT SPAIN DID NOT PLAN ADDITIONAL </p><p>LIBYAN EXPULSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS SERIES </p><p>OF EXPULSIONS AND REPRISALS IS GOING TO TAKE SPANISH- </p><p>LIBYAN RELATIONS.  THE GOS IS DRIVEN BY TWO MUTUALLY- </p><p>EXCLUSIVE DESIRES.  ON THE ONE HAND, IN THIS ELECTORAL </p><p>PERIOD IT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE FAR RIGHT (WHICH IT </p><p>HAS DONE BY PUBLICIZING THE COLONEL\'S CONNECTION TO </p><p>QADHAFI - REF C), AND SHOW IT IS </p><p>EFFECTIVE AGAINST TERRORISM (WHICH IT DID </p><p>BY BAGGING THE 10-MAN "CALL OF JESUS CHRIST" GROUP - </p><p>REF A).  AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS WANTS TO AVOID </p><p>BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TARGET FOR QADHAFI BY PERSERVING </p><p>AS MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP AS POSSIBLE.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ORDONEZ     PLAYED  TO THE SECOND LINE THIS </p><p>WEEKEND WHEN HE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES </p><p>HERE, SAYING "I DON\'T WANT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT WHICH </p><p>MIGHT AGGRAVATE A STATE OF RELATIONS WHICH IS PASSING </p><p>THROUGH A DELICATE MOMENT."  WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR </p><p>MFA SOURCE THAT SENIOR MINISTRY OFFICIALS MET TODAY </p><p>TO DECIDE HOW TO REACT TO LIBYA\'S RETALIATION </p><p>(WHICH LEAVES THE GOS EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI WITH ONLY </p><p>3 DIPLOMATS).  THE DECISION TO DO NOTHING IS </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE MINISTRY\'S LINE -- TAKEN PUBLICLY </p><p>THIS WEEKEND -- THAT IT DOES NOT WANT TO SEVER </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TRIPOLI.  THIS STRATEGY IS ONLY POSSIBLE </p><p>IF QADHAFI PLAYS ALONG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ENDERS </p><p></p></div>
