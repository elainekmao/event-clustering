FAULK FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 26, AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY POLOFF, MET MASIPULA SITHOLE, THE CHAIR OF THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT, </p><p>COLUMNIST, AND DIRECTOR OF THE HARARE-BASED MASS PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION INSTITUTE.  SITHOLE REPORTED THAT HIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS CURRENTLY COMPILING THE RESULTS OF A </p><p>NATIONWIDE SURVEY RECENTLY CONDUCTED TO UNCOVER THE </p><p>EXTENT OF VOTER APATHY IN ZIMBABWE.  SURPRISINGLY, </p><p>SITHOLE SAID THE INITIAL FINDINGS ARE POINTING TO AN 89 </p><p>TO 90 PERCENT TURNOUT IN THE EARLY 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, WHICH WOULD BE THE SECOND HIGHEST TURNOUT </p><p>SINCE ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE.  IT WOULD ALSO REPRESENT </p><p>A MAJOR TURNAROUND FROM THE PREDOMINANT ELECTORAL TREND </p><p>OF DECLINING VOTER PARTICIPATION SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  TO </p><p>ILLUSTRATE, SITHOLE STATED THAT 94 PERCENT VOTED IN </p><p>1980, 84 PERCENT IN 1985, 54 PERCENT IN 1990, 54 PERCENT </p><p>IN 1995 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, 31 PERCENT IN THE 1996 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND 48 PERCENT IN THE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>TOO LATE FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTION? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SITHOLE THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS RECENT </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENT SAYING THAT THE U.S. WAS NOT INCLINED </p><p>TO RECOGNIZE THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>UNLESS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IMPROVED.  THIS IS A POINT </p><p>THE U.S. SHOULD BE MAKING "A LOT LOUDER," THE PROFESSOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03558  01 OF 02  271549Z </p><p>OPINED.  MUGABE MUST BE WARNED OF DISINCENTIVES IF HE </p><p>DOES NOT HOLD A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION; HOWEVER, THERE </p><p>HAS NEVER BEEN ONE IN INDEPENDENT ZIMBABWE, SITHOLE </p><p>CONTINUED.  IN 1990, WHEN FORMER ZANU-PF REFORMER EDGAR </p><p>TEKERE RAN AGAINST MUGABE, THERE WAS PLENTY OF "VIOLENCE </p><p>AND SHOOTINGS."  WHEN ASKED IF HIS INSTITUTE PLANNED TO </p><p>CONDUCT A SURVEY ON PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCES, HE STATED </p><p>THE RESULTS OF ONE WOULD BE COMING OUT BY LATE JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>AN UNHAPPY EXIT AWAITS MUGABE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE IS BENT ON WINNING THE ELECTION </p><p>BY "HOOK OR CROOK," BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE TAKE TO THE </p><p>STREETS, AN "UNHAPPY EXIT" WILL BE INEVITABLE FOR </p><p>MUGABE, THE PROFESSOR PREDICTED.  IF DISINCENTIVES DID </p><p>NOT CONVINCE HIM TO HOLD A FREE ELECTION, THEN AT THIS </p><p>POINT, AN EXIT PACKAGE OF INCENTIVES FOR MUGABE TO </p><p>RELINQUISH POWER WOULD BE "APPROPRIATE."  THE ARMY WOULD </p><p>UNDERWRITE A SET OF ASSURANCES AND ACT AS NEGOTIATOR </p><p>WITH TSVANGIRAI, WHO UNDERSTANDS THE NECESSITY OF </p><p>LETTING MUGABE GO IN PEACE.  MUGABE KNOWS HE IS </p><p>UNPOPULAR AND IS WORRIED ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL SECURITY -- </p><p>OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT BE CLINGING TO POWER SO </p><p>DESPERATELY.  ASKED ABOUT MUGABE\'S FINANCIAL SECURITY, </p><p>SITHOLE SAID THIS IS NOT THE PRESIDENT\'S PRIMARY </p><p>CONCERN.  HE ALREADY HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY FOR HIM </p><p>AND HIS FAMILY.  HOWEVER, IF GIVEN THE PROPER </p><p>ASSURANCES, MUGABE WOULD LEAVE POWER, SITHOLE OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>A LITTLE HELP FROM MUGABE\'S FRIENDS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03558  01 OF 02  271549Z </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AMBASSADOR THEN INQUIRED WHETHER MUGABE\'S INNER </p><p>CIRCLE WOULD ACCEPT MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE, AND SITHOLE SAID </p><p>THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE EXIT PACKAGE. </p><p>ULTRALOYALISTS SUCH AS SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA -- AND PRESUMED HEIR TO THE MUGABE THRONE -- </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DEPARTURE DEAL.  EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THERE ARE THOSE IN ZANU-PF WHO WILL AGAIN TRY TO </p><p>PERSUADE MUGABE TO STEP ASIDE AT THIS YEAR\'S RULING </p><p>PARTY CONFERENCE, THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED.  ALL THOSE </p><p>REFORMISTS WITH INFLUENCE, SUCH AS FORMER MINISTER </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO, HAVE BEEN PUSHED ASIDE.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI AND FORMER DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>CHIEF SOLOMON MUJURU ARE "REASONABLE AND RATIONAL," BUT </p><p>THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS OF MUGABE\'S INNER CIRCLE. </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO -- WITH WHOM SITHOLE </p><p>USED TO JOG IN THE U.S. AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE -- COULD DIRECT TRANSITION EVENTS IN A POSITIVE </p><p>WAY IF HE WAS PROPERLY APPROACHED AND GIVEN SIMILAR EXIT </p><p>INCENTIVES, THE PROFESSOR OFFERED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5493 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03558  02 OF 02  271549Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------43B88F  271550Z /38 </p><p>P 271500Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0399 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EXPECT HUGE VOTER TURNOUT IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>POLITICAL POLLSTER TELLS AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>5.

ALTHOUGH WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE </p><p>THE POLL\'S RESULTS AND METHODOLOGY, WE HAVE TO TEMPER </p><p>THE INITIAL FINDINGS WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO EVEN RESPOND TO POLLING </p><p>QUESTIONS.  REPORTEDLY, 50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE APPROACHED </p><p>REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN AUTHORITATIVE SURVEY DUE </p><p>OUT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
