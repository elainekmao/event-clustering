(C) SUMMARY:  The Tamil Tigers have sent the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators a tough letter demanding the </p><p>setting up of an "interim administrative structure" in </p><p>the north/east, which the group would control.  The </p><p>Tigers say they might restart peace talks and come to </p><p>the Tokyo conference if the government reacts positively </p><p>to their proposal.  With contacts telling us the group </p><p>is in an increasingly hard-line mode, the sudden </p><p>recrudescense of the interim structure idea raises real </p><p>questions regarding the Tigers\' commitment to the </p><p>process.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) TOUGH TIGER LETTER:  Late May 21, the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) sent the </p><p>Norwegian government facilitators a tough letter </p><p>demanding the setting up of an interim structure in the </p><p>north and east.  (Note:  The text of the letter was </p><p>posted on the pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" and has been </p><p>sent to SA/INS in Ref A.)  In the long, complicated, and </p><p>somewhat convoluted letter, which was addressed to </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen, LTTE spokesman </p><p>Anton Balasingham makes clear that the Tigers believe </p><p>that previous agreements on structures/modalities of </p><p>funneling humanitarian/development assistance to the </p><p>north and east are not working.  On this point, </p><p>Balasingham states flatly: </p><p> </p><p>"Unfortunately, SIHRN (see note below) failed to </p><p>function effectively and no progress has been made </p><p>toward alleviating the hardships and suffering of the </p><p>displaced population...This lack of performance and the </p><p>failure to produce tangible results on urgent </p><p>humanitarian issues has eroded all confidence of the </p><p>Tamil people in SIHRN." </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  "SIHRN" stands for Sub-Committee on Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs for the North and </p><p>East, which was formed earlier this year as a joint GSL- </p><p>LTTE committee working on assistance issues.  Since the </p><p>committee was set up, the Tigers have basically argued </p><p>that they wanted watertight acknowledgement of their </p><p>right to control funds allotted for the north/east.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In light of this characterization of SIHRN\'s </p><p>performance and rejecting recent GSL proposals to reform </p><p>assistance implementation, Balasingham goes on to state </p><p>that the LTTE has no choice but to return to its long- </p><p>standing demand that an "interim administrative </p><p>structure" be set up for the north and east.  (Note: </p><p>The letter is not clear, but the LTTE seems to be </p><p>envisaging that the interim structure would mainly focus </p><p>on economic matters, but would also have a dominant </p><p>political role.)  In making this demand, Balasingham </p><p>notes that during the December 2001 national election </p><p>campaign the governing United National Party (UNP) </p><p>advocated the setting up of an interim structure to </p><p>govern the north and east.  Although the idea of forming </p><p>such a body was left off the peace process\' agenda up to </p><p>now, Balasingham says the LTTE believes it is now time </p><p>to revive it because the proposal is the only way </p><p>forward given the failure of SIHRN and given that "a </p><p>permanent political settlement is not feasible in the </p><p>immediate future."  While couching his public comments </p><p>carefully, Balasingham also leaves little doubt that the </p><p>LTTE should control this interim structure.  He notes, </p><p>for example, that the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan accord </p><p>provided the "LTTE a dominant participatory role" in a </p><p>proposed interim council to govern the north/east. </p><p>(Note:  Aside from this one mention of the Indo-Sri </p><p>Lankan accord, the letter is otherwise vague on </p><p>potential constitutional implications.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Balasingham also addresses the issue of the </p><p>peace talks, which the Tigers recently pulled out of, </p><p>and the upcoming donors conference in Tokyo, which the </p><p>Tigers have said they will not attend.  He indicates </p><p>that a positive response to the LTTE\'s demands might </p><p>lead the LTTE to change its mind on these matters, </p><p>stating: </p><p> </p><p>"A positive and constructive response from the prime </p><p>minister setting out his ideas and proposals in clear </p><p>and concrete terms will certainly help our leadership to </p><p>take a crucial decision on the resumption of peace talks </p><p>and participation at the donor conference in Japan." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TAMIL CONTACTS ON LTTE MINDSET:  The LTTE letter </p><p>came out too late on May 21 for contacts to provide us a </p><p>considered response.  In discussions with poloffs held </p><p>early May 21, however, Tamil political contacts who had </p><p>met with the LTTE on May 20, indicated that the group </p><p>was increasingly in a hard-line, uncompromising mode. </p><p>Echoing the comments of other Tamil National Alliance </p><p>(TNA) figures, Suresh Premachandran, told us that </p><p>political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam, who led the Tiger </p><p>side at the meeting, made clear that the LTTE was fed up </p><p>with the GSL.  The LTTE felt that the government -- </p><p>while basically well intentioned -- was not strong and </p><p>could not carry through on its plans because it was too </p><p>afraid of Sinhalese chauvinists.  In making these </p><p>comments, Premachandran said Thamilchelvam asserted in </p><p>very strong terms that the Sinhalese south could not be </p><p>trusted because it had broken agreements with Tamils so </p><p>many times in the past.  (Note:  In a May 19 meeting, </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Helgesen told us that LTTE </p><p>leaders had made this same point in vivid terms during </p><p>recent interactions with the Norwegians.)  At this </p><p>point, Premachandran added, the LTTE wanted written, </p><p>ironclad assurances from the GSL on the way forward, or </p><p>they would continue to stall the process. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Despite their hardline positioning, </p><p>Premachandran still thought that the Tigers "were </p><p>committed to the peace process and would listen to </p><p>reason."  He allowed that he was not sure the government </p><p>could meet in short order all of the LTTE\'s demands and </p><p>thus ensure the group\'s participation in the Tokyo </p><p>conference.  He thought, however, that the LTTE had not </p><p>totally discounted the possibility of participating in </p><p>Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) (((Note:  Before Balasingham\'s letter was </p><p>issued, we had heard that the LTTE\'s S.P. Thamilchelvam </p><p>was planning to hold a press conference on May 22 in the </p><p>LTTE-controlled town of Kilinochchi in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka.  This press conference had been originally slated </p><p>to take place on May 21, but had been postponed.  In </p><p>light of Balasingham\'s letter, which quite clearly </p><p>enunciates LTTE thinking at this point, it is not clear </p><p>whether the May 22 press conference is still on and what </p><p>it might add if it is.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  While respectful in tone, the LTTE </p><p>letter is hard-edged and clearly to be taken very </p><p>seriously.  Balasingham, for example, at several points </p><p>in the letter underscores that he is transmitting the </p><p>views of V. Prabhakaran, the LTTE\'s supreme leader. </p><p>The sudden recrudescence of the interim structure idea, </p><p>which had basically dropped from sight for months, </p><p>raises real questions re the Tigers\' commitment to the </p><p>process.  The group almost certainly knows that the </p><p>issue is a very tricky one for the government and would </p><p>-- under normal circumstances -- take months to </p><p>negotiate.  That said, the Tigers are pressing the </p><p>government for a response right now.  This degree of </p><p>impatience does not appear to bode well for LTTE </p><p>agreement to resume the peace talks and reconsider its </p><p>decision not to participate in Tokyo.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
