<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 OTTAWA 000577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, G, INL, DRL, PRM, IWI, WHA/PPC, USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, ELAB, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA - 2002 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>The following is Mission Canada\'s submission for the </p><p>2002-2003 Trafficking in Persons report. Answers are keyed to </p><p>numbered paragraphs in reftel. Embassy POC is PolOff Craig </p><p>Bryant, telephone (613) 688-5339, fax (613) 688-3098. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 16.  Overview of A Country\'s Activities to </p><p>Eliminate Trafficking in Persons: </p><p> </p><p>--A.  Canada is a country of transit, destination and origin </p><p>for the trafficking of men, women, and children. As a </p><p>destination country, trafficking of persons who have arrived </p><p>from other countries occurs within Canada\'s borders. Domestic </p><p>trafficking of Canadian citizens or legal residents does not </p><p>take place in significant numbers, but there have been cases </p><p>of Canadian citizen minors trafficked to other parts of </p><p>Canada (particularly urban centers such as Toronto, Montreal, </p><p>and Vancouver) and to cities in the United States for </p><p>exploitation in the sex trade. Trafficking does not occur in </p><p>territory outside of the government\'s control. </p><p> </p><p>Reliable numbers showing the extent of Canada\'s trafficking </p><p>problem are not available. A November 2000 University of </p><p>Toronto research paper published by Status of Women Canada </p><p>(SWC), a government agency, estimated that 8,000 to 16,000 </p><p>persons entered Canada each year as the result of </p><p>trafficking, either to remain in Canada or in transit to the </p><p>United States. Government and NGO sources have indicated this </p><p>figure is no longer a reliable estimate, and that there is </p><p>simply no hard data available on the number of persons </p><p>trafficked in Canada. A January 2000 Government of Canada </p><p>report on trafficking in women stated that information on </p><p>trafficking in Canada is limited, and that satisfying data </p><p>collection requirements presents a major challenge for the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>Sources of available information range widely, including </p><p>police reports, social workers, NGO\'s, research documents, </p><p>federal agencies, press reports, hospital data, and more. </p><p>Reliability of these sources also varies widely. Women seem </p><p>to be trafficked more commonly than any other group, though </p><p>children are sometimes trafficked for work in the sex or drug </p><p>trades. Men are trafficked as indentured labor, but </p><p>apparently not in significant numbers. The most frequently </p><p>trafficked persons are from countries in eastern and southern </p><p>Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America. </p><p> </p><p>--B.  Trafficked persons most often come from East </p><p>(especially China) and Southeast Asia (including Thailand, </p><p>Cambodia, the Philippines) and eastern Europe (including </p><p>Russia). Persons trafficked into Canada who do not remain </p><p>here are most often trafficked to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>--C.  There does not appear to have been any change in the </p><p>direction or extent of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>--D.  There are no surveys planned or underway to document </p><p>the extent and nature of trafficking in Canada. SWC published </p><p>three reports in 2000 on different aspects of trafficking in </p><p>Canada. After a new anti-trafficking law took effect in June </p><p>2002, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began gathering </p><p>information on a nation-wide basis on human trafficking </p><p>activity. </p><p> </p><p>--E.  Conditions for trafficked persons are difficult.  Many </p><p>trafficking victims are forced by violence or intimidation </p><p>into the sex trade, including some who are initially tricked </p><p>into it. Forced labor outside of the sex trade is less </p><p>common, though it does exist in slaughterhouses, sweatshops, </p><p>farms, restaurants, and factories. Information on such forced </p><p>labor is scarce. Persons trafficked into indentured or forced </p><p>labor are subject to violence, threats, or intimidation to </p><p>themselves, or to family members remaining in their countries </p><p>of origin. Victims often have their passports or other </p><p>identification documents confiscated by traffickers, which </p><p>further restricts their ability to flee their oppressors. </p><p>Victims have limited access to government assistance for a </p><p>number of reasons: they may not speak English or French, they </p><p>fear being jailed or deported, they are ashamed, or they are </p><p>unaware assistance is available to them. </p><p> </p><p>--F.  Canada is not a country of origin for significant </p><p>numbers of trafficked persons. Of those Canadian citizens or </p><p>legal residents who are trafficked, minors (mostly runaways </p><p>or otherwise troubled youth) and aboriginal persons seem to </p><p>be the main groups targeted. </p><p> </p><p>--G.  There is political will at the highest levels of the </p><p>Canadian government to combat trafficking in persons.  The </p><p>government is making a good faith effort to address </p><p>trafficking, as demonstrated by a new law that went into </p><p>effect in 2002 making trafficking in persons illegal. </p><p>Funding for social services was increased in the GOC\'s most </p><p>recent budget. The GOC is devoting increased resources </p><p>(personnel, funding, and focus) in areas such as border </p><p>control and immigration that should have an impact on </p><p>trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>--H.  Governmental authorities or individual government </p><p>employees do not facilitate, condone, and are not otherwise </p><p>complicit in trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>--I.  Funding for law enforcement has increased overall at </p><p>the federal level, but trafficking in persons is not a law </p><p>enforcement priority. Official corruption is not a problem. </p><p>Government aid to victims has been limited due to a general </p><p>lack of awareness of the existence or extent of trafficking, </p><p>and lack of a specific anti-trafficking program. The </p><p>principal factor hampering efforts to combat human </p><p>trafficking is that it has not been a highly visible problem </p><p>in Canada. Another factor hampering anti-trafficking efforts </p><p>is that Canada\'s law enforcement jurisdiction is fragmented, </p><p>involving various levels of governments and numerous </p><p>departments and agencies. Federal law enforcement authorities </p><p>cannot claim authority over provincial cases. Finally, </p><p>Canada\'s strong tradition of respect for the rights and </p><p>liberties of all persons, including non-citizens, limits the </p><p>means (such as investigative detention) that law enforcement </p><p>authorities might otherwise employ in trafficking </p><p>investigations. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 17.  Prevention: </p><p> </p><p>--A.  The government acknowledges that trafficking is a </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>--B.  Status of Women Canada (SWC), Citizenship and </p><p>Immigration Canada (CIC), Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade (DFAIT), Human Resources Development </p><p>Canada (HRDC), Justice Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted </p><p>Police (RCMP), and the Solicitor General Canada are the </p><p>federal agencies involved in anti-trafficking efforts. </p><p>Provincial and local law enforcement authorities, such as the </p><p>Montreal Police Department and Toronto Police Department, are </p><p>also involved. </p><p> </p><p>--C.  There are no current and there have been no previous </p><p>anti-trafficking information or education campaigns, but the </p><p>government has supported efforts by NGO\'s and community </p><p>organizations to raise awareness of trafficking and has </p><p>funded academic studies of the problem. A variety of </p><p>organizations, including Canadian universities, serve as </p><p>resource centers for trafficking information. The Center for </p><p>Refugee Studies at York University in Toronto began research </p><p>on global trafficking in women in 1998, and is currently </p><p>working on a study of developed country "markets" for </p><p>trafficked persons, with an emphasis on North America. </p><p> </p><p>--D.  Canada is a western, prosperous democratic country that </p><p>strongly promotes women\'s participation in economic and </p><p>political decision-making, as well as efforts to keep </p><p>children in school. </p><p> </p><p>--E.  The GOC has implemented programs aimed directly or </p><p>indirectly at preventing trafficking into Canada. For </p><p>example, CIC deploys immigration control officers at </p><p>strategic transit points throughout the world to deter the </p><p>illicit transit of migrants to Canada. Canada recently </p><p>adapted a "one person, one passport" policy, which, it </p><p>believes, will help deter trafficking in children. Under </p><p>Canada\'s previous policy, children could be included in the </p><p>passports of adults and a photograph of the child was not </p><p>required. Under the new policy all Canadian passports must </p><p>include a photo of the holder, and children must have their </p><p>own passports. The GOC also seeks to stop the spread of </p><p>trafficking in developing countries by funding initiatives </p><p>proposed by the Canadian International Development Agency </p><p>(CIDA - equivalent to the U.S. Agency for International </p><p>Development). (See 17-I below) </p><p>--F. The GOC supports NGO\'s, and other organizations and </p><p>elements of civil society concerned with the issue of </p><p>trafficking, by funding research projects and sponsoring </p><p>conferences. SWC supports community-based action to address </p><p>trafficking by providing funding for educational forums. </p><p> </p><p>--G. The government adequately monitors the borders, but </p><p>Canada is a large country with thousands of miles of </p><p>coastline, and therefore surreptitious entry by migrants is </p><p>difficult to prevent. There were two instances in recent </p><p>years when boats were discovered trying to smuggle trafficked </p><p>persons from China into British Columbia. The movements of </p><p>known immigrants into Canada are monitored by CIC through a </p><p>databank. </p><p>--H. The GOC set up an interagency working group in 1998 </p><p>initially for the purpose of consulting on the UN Convention </p><p>on Transnational Organized Crime and related protocols (the </p><p>Convention and two related protocols were ratified by Canada </p><p>on May 14, 2002). This interagency  group has now turned to </p><p>some of the domestic issues and challenges in respect to </p><p>trafficking in persons.  The International Crime and </p><p>Terrorism Division in DIFAIT\'s Global Affairs Bureau leads </p><p>this group. Other agencies represented are SWC, CIC, DFAIT, </p><p>HRDC, Justice Canada, the RCMP, and Solicitor General Canada. </p><p>(See above, Paragraph 17-B.) The group assists in </p><p>coordinating national efforts to combat trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>The federal government does not have a national </p><p>anti-trafficking or public corruption task force. There have </p><p>been several joint task forces of federal, provincial, and </p><p>local authorities that have focused on trafficking rings in </p><p>specific areas for a limited period of time. For example, </p><p>Operation Trade in Toronto was a massive, multi-police force </p><p>investigation of traffickers who had purchased young women in </p><p>Thailand, transported them to Toronto, and forced them to </p><p>work as sex slaves. In Montreal, the police force recently </p><p>established a task force which focuses, in part, on the </p><p>growing problem of juveniles being coerced into the sex </p><p>trade. </p><p> </p><p>--I. CIDA is providing funding for programs which seek to </p><p>stop the sexual and labor exploitation of children in </p><p>developing countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Benin </p><p>in Africa; Nicaragua and Peru in Latin America; and Haiti in </p><p>the Caribbean. Through the South East Asian Fund for </p><p>Institutional and Legal Development (SEAFILD), CIDA is </p><p>supporting the Illegal Labour Movements: Trafficking in Women </p><p>and Children project addressing trafficking in the Mekong </p><p>delta area. SEAFILD also funds the Support for the </p><p>Development of Protocols for Repatriation of Trafficked Women </p><p>and Children Project, by the Coalition to Fight Against Child </p><p>Exploitation (FACE) in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>Other federal agencies provide funding to international </p><p>organizations to assist in combating trafficking. CIC, for </p><p>example, has provided funding to the International </p><p>Organization for Migration (IOM) to assist in a case study on </p><p>migrant trafficking originating in Nicaragua. DIFAIT\'s Human </p><p>Security Program recently made a grant of C$200,000 to a </p><p>Latin American NGO, Casa Alianza, and IOM for assistance to </p><p>Honduran street children at risk of falling victim to human </p><p>traffickers. A portion of this grant will be used for the </p><p>voluntary repatriation to Honduras of approximately 100 </p><p>juveniles who had been transported to Canada by drug </p><p>trafficking gangs and forced to work as street dealers. </p><p> </p><p>--J.  Canada does not have a national action plan to address </p><p>trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>--K.  The interagency working group on trafficking (see 17-H) </p><p>is responsible for developing government anti-trafficking </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 18. Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: </p><p>--A.  The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Bill C-11) </p><p>was passed by Parliament and signed into law by the Governor </p><p>General in 2001. The Act entered into force June 11, 2002, </p><p>when regulations to implement the Act were finalized. </p><p>While there have been no prosecutions under C-11 to date, the </p><p>significance of the bill is that, for the first time, a law </p><p>is in place in Canada specifically prohibiting and punishing </p><p>trafficking in persons.  In Part 3, under the main heading </p><p>Enforcement, Paragraphs 118 and 119 state: </p><p> </p><p>      118.  (1) No person shall knowingly organize the coming </p><p>into Canada of one or more persons by means of abduction, </p><p>fraud, deception or use or threat of force or coercion. </p><p>      118.  (2) For the purpose of subsection  (1), </p><p>"organize", with respect to persons, includes their </p><p>recruitment or transportation and, after their entry into </p><p>Canada, the receipt or harbouring of those persons. </p><p>      119.   A person shall not disembark a person or group </p><p>of persons at sea for the purpose of inducing, aiding or </p><p>abetting them to come into Canada in contravention of this </p><p>Act. </p><p> </p><p>--B.  The potential penalties for trafficking in persons are </p><p>set out in Paragraphs 120 and 121 of the Act.  They state: </p><p> </p><p>      120.  A person who contravenes section 118 or 119 is </p><p>guilty of an offence and liable on conviction by way of </p><p>indictment to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or to life </p><p>imprisonment, or to both. </p><p>      121. (1) The court in determining the penalty to be </p><p>imposed under subsection 117 (2) or (3) or section 120, shall </p><p>take into account whether (a) grievous bodily harm or death </p><p>occurred during the commission of the offence; (b) the </p><p>commission of the offence was for the benefit of, at the </p><p>direction of or in association with a criminal organization; </p><p>(c) the commission of the offence was for profit, whether or </p><p>not any profit was realized; and (d) a person was subjected </p><p>to humiliating or degrading treatment, including with respect </p><p>to work or health conditions or sexual exploitation as a </p><p>result of the commission of the offence. </p><p> </p><p>--C.  The penalty for sexual assault is up to 10 years </p><p>imprisonment. The penalty for sexual assault using a weapon, </p><p>threats against a third person, or when bodily harm results </p><p>is up to 14 years imprisonment. The penalty for aggravated </p><p>sexual assault is up to life imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p>--D.  No cases have been prosecuted under the new </p><p>anti-trafficking provisions in the short period since they </p><p>took effect. The government has prosecuted and even convicted </p><p>a few human traffickers and smugglers for related offenses, </p><p>but penalties imposed have been minimal. For example, in a </p><p>Toronto prosecution brought as part of the Operation Trade </p><p>investigation, a judge sentenced the person described as the </p><p>mastermind of a sex slave operation to less than two years of </p><p>house arrest. This situation is likely to change as law </p><p>enforcement officers and prosecutors become more </p><p>knowledgeable about investigating and prosecuting cases under </p><p>the new anti-trafficking law. </p><p> </p><p>--E.  Reports show that traffickers operate at all levels - </p><p>as freelancers, in small crime groups, and as part of large </p><p>international organized crime syndicates. Marriage brokers </p><p>sometimes serve as a front for traffickers.  Government </p><p>officials are not involved in trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>--F.  The government actively uses modern anti-crime methods </p><p>to investigate cases of trafficking, but until now there has </p><p>not been a sustained focus on preventing or prosecuting </p><p>trafficking in persons. After the new anti-trafficking law </p><p>took effect, the RCMP began collecting and analyzing data on </p><p>trafficking on a nation-wide basis. </p><p> </p><p>--G.  In the past the government has not provided specialized </p><p>training for government officials in the investigation and </p><p>prosecution of trafficking, but with the implementation of </p><p>the new anti-trafficking law it now plans to provide such </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p>--H.  The GOC cooperates with other governments in </p><p>investigating and prosecuting trafficking, though on an ad </p><p>hoc basis.  Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities </p><p>have cooperated on cases in the past, including a 1998 </p><p>investigation into smuggling from China through Toronto and </p><p>on to New York City that resulted in the arrest of 11 people </p><p>in Canada and 30 in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>--I.  The GOC has rarely (if ever) extradited human </p><p>traffickers to other countries because Canada did not have a </p><p>law against trafficking in humans. With the implementation of </p><p>the new anti-trafficking law, Canada will be better able to </p><p>extradite traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>--J.  There is no evidence of government involvement in or </p><p>tolerance of trafficking at any level. </p><p> </p><p>--K.  N/A </p><p> </p><p>--L.  Canada ratified ILO Convention 182 in 2000. Canada </p><p>signed the Sale of Children Protocol supplementing the Rights </p><p>of the Child Convention in 2001. In 2002, Canada ratified the </p><p>Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, as well as the </p><p>Optional Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and </p><p>the Optional Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by </p><p>Land, Sea, and Air. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 19.  Protection and Assistance to Victims: </p><p> </p><p>--A.  There are a number of programs and services in Canada </p><p>that can assist trafficking victims, even though they are not </p><p>specifically aimed at such victims. These include health </p><p>care, legal service, and other social services. Trafficking </p><p>victims are eligible to apply for permanent residence status </p><p>in Canada under humanitarian/compassionate provisions of </p><p>Canadian immigration law. In addition, trafficking victims </p><p>can make claims for Convention refugee status. The Canadian </p><p>Immigration and Refugee Board introduced Gender-Related </p><p>Persecution Guidelines in 1993 that may be relevant to some </p><p>trafficking cases. The new Immigration Act (Bill C-11) states </p><p>that the best interests of the child may be considered in the </p><p>context of applications for permanent residence on </p><p>humanitarian and compassionate grounds and certain decisions </p><p>taken by the Immigration Appeals Division. </p><p> </p><p>--B.  The federal government does not provide funding or </p><p>other support to NGO\'s for service to victims. Services and </p><p>assistance for crime victims are normally a provincial </p><p>matter. Victims of trafficking are eligible to apply for </p><p>assistance from victims\' assistance funds maintained by the </p><p>provincial governments. Many victims are eligible for refugee </p><p>status, but this presents a problem because traffickers are </p><p>aware of and can exploit this fact. </p><p> </p><p>--C.  Victims of trafficking may be detained, fined and </p><p>deported. This is a source of frustration for federal and </p><p>provincial authorities who need to obtain the assistance of </p><p>victims in prosecuting traffickers. Many police and </p><p>immigration officers view foreign prostitutes brought into </p><p>Canada by traffickers as illegal immigrants and petty </p><p>criminals, and not as victims. This attitude is slowly </p><p>beginning to change, but will require more training and </p><p>education. </p><p> </p><p>--D.  The government sometimes encourages victims to assist </p><p>in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking, but this </p><p>is a difficult task. Victims often come from countries where </p><p>the police are corrupt and dangerous and may even be part of </p><p>the trafficking network. In addition, victims may not speak </p><p>English or French or understand their rights or what the </p><p>police want from them. Victims are therefore often reluctant </p><p>to cooperate with the police in a prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>A victim who is a material witness against a trafficker is </p><p>permitted to obtain a humanitarian and compassionate visa to </p><p>remain in Canada, which would entitle him or her to work. </p><p>Under Canada\'s Criminal Code and victims\' compensation </p><p>programs at different jurisdictional levels, victims of </p><p>trafficking can obtain damages for injuries suffered. In </p><p>addition, the provincial governments of Alberta and Ontario </p><p>recently enacted legislation giving those provinces the power </p><p>to sue pimps and other sexual exploiters of children in order </p><p>to recover the cost of treating their victims. </p><p> </p><p>--E. Protection for trafficking victims is available, though </p><p>it is a new concept. Such protection is needed, as motorcycle </p><p>gangs and organized crime groups that frequently resort to </p><p>violence and intimidation are heavily involved in human </p><p>trafficking. Many law enforcement officers do not view </p><p>foreign prostitutes or illegal workers as victims of </p><p>traffickers, and do not understand that these persons often </p><p>require additional protection from organized crime. </p><p> </p><p>--F.  Government officials do not receive specialized </p><p>training for providing assistance to victims of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>--G.  As there are few if any Canadian victims of trafficking </p><p>repatriated to Canada, there is no government program to </p><p>provide assistance to such persons. </p><p> </p><p>--H.  The following NGO\'s work with trafficking victims in </p><p>Canada: </p><p>- The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (Vancouver, BC) </p><p>- The Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women (Victoria, </p><p>BC) </p><p>- Philippine Women Center (Vancouver, BC) </p><p>- Kid Friendly Society of British Society (West Vancouver, BC) </p><p>- Multicultural History Society of Ontario (Toronto, ON) </p><p>- Toronto Network Against Trafficking in Women (Toronto, ON) </p><p>- Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, </p><p>(Toronto, ON) </p><p>- Save the Children Canada (Vancouver, BC and Toronto, ON) </p><p>- Kelowna Women\'s Resource Center Society (Kelowna, BC) </p><p>- Prostitution Alternatives Counseling and Education Society </p><p>(Vancouver, BC) </p><p>- Federation Des Femmes Du Quebec (Montreal, QC) </p><p>- Alberta Association of Sexual Assault Centers (Calgary, AB) </p><p>- Prostitutes Empowerment, Education, and Resource Society, </p><p>(Victoria, BC) </p><p>- Saskatoon Communities for Children Inc.
