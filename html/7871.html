<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001172 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANT BERGER LEAVES THE PAN, </p><p>ACCEPTS CANDIDACY OF COALITION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Presidential front-runner Oscar Berger </p><p>announced on May 1 that he was leaving the National Action </p><p>Party (PAN) to head a coalition of three smaller parties. </p><p>Berger broke with the PAN after internal tensions erupted </p><p>April 30 when the PAN Executive Committee (controlled by his </p><p>rival Leonel Lopez) voted to no longer support Berger as its </p><p>presidential candidate after he discussed forming an </p><p>electoral alliance without party permission.  Berger,s exit </p><p>from the PAN, while not unexpected, adds a new wrinkle to the </p><p>already muddled presidential race.  As other parties regroup, </p><p>the ruling Guatemalan National Front, headed by Efrain Rios </p><p>Montt, hopes to benefit from splits in the opposition.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Berger Candidacy Still Afloat </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Oscar Berger, who won the PAN presidential primary </p><p>in October, 2002, announced on May 1 that he would be the </p><p>presidential candidate for a coalition of political parties </p><p>currently made up of Otto Perez Molina,s Patriotic Party </p><p>(PP), Jorge Briz,s  Reform Movement (MR) and Ricardo </p><p>Castillo Sinebali,s National Solidarity Party (PSN).  Berger </p><p>had been wooing the coalation ever since differences (largely </p><p>over patronage) between him and PAN Executive Secretary </p><p>Leonel Lopez became increasingly unsolvable and threatened to </p><p>marr the upcoming election.  When it became apparent that </p><p>there was no conciliation in sight, Berger announced in late </p><p>April that he would accept the support of the coalition, </p><p>which goes by the initials GANA, provoking the PAN Executive </p><p>Committee to announce on April 30 that Berger\'s decision </p><p>effectively annulled his candidacy as the PAN\'s presidential </p><p>hopeful.  That was the final straw for Berger, who withdrew </p><p>from the PAN and began openly campaigning for the GANA.  In a </p><p>campaign stop in the Department of Solola on May 3, Berger </p><p>rallied local PAN members to vote for him.  He received the </p><p>support of the local PAN leadership, that has now switched to </p><p>his GANA coalition.  Berger hopes to woo away significant </p><p>support from PAN voters who voted for him in the primaries. </p><p> </p><p>PAN\'s Prospects Sinking </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Without Berger, who, despite a massive loss to </p><p>President Portillo in 1999 consistently registers the highest </p><p>poll numbers, the PAN enters the exclusive control of its </p><p>Secretary General, Leonel Lopez Rodas.  It was Rodas who lost </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the PAN primary to Berger.  After apparently patching things </p><p>up, Rodas and his allies strongly objected to Berger,s </p><p>naming Gonzalez as his preferred running-mate.  Rodas seized </p><p>Berger,s discussions about forming an alliance with other </p><p>parties (without party approval) as the pretext for his </p><p>ouster.  Thus far, the PAN has not announced a replacement </p><p>candidate for Berger. </p><p> </p><p>Other groups GANA-bound? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The GANA coalition is in discussion with other </p><p>small parties, including the divided leftist New National </p><p>Alliance (ANN), which desperately needs financial support. </p><p>The Unionista Party, led by former ministers under the Arzu </p><p>Administration who split from the PAN in 2000, is currently </p><p>keeping its distance from GANA, though we understand that </p><p>there have been serious talks of an ultimate union. Christian </p><p>Democratic Party (DCG) candidate Ricardo Bueso has launched a </p><p>media blitz to raise his name recognition without much </p><p>success, raising speculation that the DCG and its electoral </p><p>partner, the Democratic Union party (UD) may also eventually </p><p>join the GANA coalition. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Holdouts </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, the leftist URNG has pledged to stay </p><p>away from alliances this election, after suffering disastrous </p><p>results in previous electoral coalitions.  Alvaro Colom is </p><p>flirting with the PAN, after rejecting the GANA coalition and </p><p>the earlier offer of the PAN vice presidential nomination </p><p>under Berger.  The ANN is considering throwing its support to </p><p>Alvaro Colom or Rigoberto Queme, the first indigenous </p><p>presidential aspirant heading the Solidarity Movement </p><p>alliance of civic committees, which has not yet been </p><p>officially registered in the race.  Jacobo Arbenz Villanova, </p><p>son of the late president ousted by the 1954 U.S.-supported </p><p>coup, is another long-shot candidate (for the Democratic </p><p>Social Participation Party-PDSP) who has chosen to avoid </p><p>electoral alliances. </p><p> </p><p>Boost to the FRG </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The FRG has the most to gain from the split-up of </p><p>the PAN, though many analysts do not believe the large gap in </p><p>the polls between Berger and Rios Montt will narrow much as a </p><p>result.  The ruling FRG,s electoral possibilities could </p><p>suffer if the GANA coalition gains further strength by </p><p>uniting the opposition.  At present the FRG will hold its </p><p>national assembly (postponed from May 3 to May 24), at which </p><p>it will name its presidential candidate.  Conventional wisdom </p><p>is that President of Congress Rios Montt will be selected as </p><p>its presidential candidate, and Agriculture Minister Edin </p><p>Barrientos as his running mate.  Should the FRG choose Rios </p><p>Montt to head its ticket, we expect there will be challenges </p><p>filed before the Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Berger,s split with the PAN reflects the </p><p>institutional weakness of Guatemalan political parties, and </p><p>could give a momentary boost to the FRG by dividing the </p><p>opposition.  The split further reflects the pique and poor </p><p>political judgment of both Berger and Lopez Rodas, neither of </p><p>whom was prepared to make the concessions on patronage </p><p>necessary to keep the party together.  Berger and the GANA </p><p>coalition have better prospects than the PAN to recover from </p><p>this setback, since Berger,s financial supporters apparently </p><p>still view him as the most likely prospect to unseat the FRG. </p><p> Considerable polling indicates that Berger has better </p><p>positive name recognition than anyone else in the PAN party. </p><p>Attracting and holding a diverse coalition together, however, </p><p>will be difficult for Berger. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
