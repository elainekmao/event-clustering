On March 24, from about 3:45 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., a </p><p>demonstration against the war in Iraq took place outside the </p><p>Embassy.  The event was organized by Carlos Reyes, President </p><p>of the Popular Block, an anti-U.S. leftist organization. </p><p>Participating in the demonstration were other like-minded </p><p>organizations, all of whom have taken part in past anti-U.S. </p><p>protests (reftel).  Post initially expected up to 1,000 </p><p>protesters, but at most only 300 demonstrators participated. </p><p>While Reyes had contacted many other organizations, including </p><p>labor unions, in an effort to expand turn-out, attendance was </p><p>limited to past protest groups. </p><p> </p><p>2. Two protesters threw paint at a USG facility and one </p><p>painted a slogan before police moved in to protect the </p><p>property.  Also, several U.S. flags were burned and three </p><p>other men "launched" about ten loud fireworks.  The </p><p>demonstration ended peacefully when the crowd moved on to the </p><p>Spanish Embassy. Police presence was adequate to ensure the </p><p>protection of USG property and personnel. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT: Despite its opposition to the war in Iraq, the </p><p>Liberal Party avoided any involvement in the demonstration. </p><p>One leader said "we are anti-war, not anti-U.S." END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
