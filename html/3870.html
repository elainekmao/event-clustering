<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005718 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON U.S. DECISION REGARDING </p><p>JERUSALEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all Arabic dailies today, October </p><p>2, carry wire service reports highlighting President </p><p>Bush\'s signature of the Foreign Relations </p><p>Authorization Act for FY03, which includes a </p><p>"Jerusalem provision" that calls on the United States </p><p>to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\'s "undivided and </p><p>eternal capital".  One paper\'s headline announced "New </p><p>American Balfour Declaration" (Al-Aswaq); while the </p><p>headline in high-circulation, semi-official Al Ra\'i\'s </p><p>read: "Bush signs Congressional decision to consider </p><p>Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital".   Mass-appeal, </p><p>independent daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm characterized the </p><p>signing as being the result of "a deal between the </p><p>Congress and the White House that opens the door for a </p><p>decision to strike Iraq."  Majority of editorial </p><p>commentaries today strongly criticize the U.S. action </p><p>as "extremely  provocative" and as a "blow" to </p><p>international legitimacy and "disrespect" to the </p><p>Muslim and Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A very provocative American law" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/02) editorializes:  "The law that was submitted by </p><p>Congress and signed by the President considering </p><p>Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital represents the biggest </p><p>and most dangerous defiance of the Arab and Muslim </p><p>world.  This law is, without a doubt, a huge blow to </p><p>the already fledgling peace process.  It also weakens </p><p>even more the credibility of the American mediator, </p><p>who is well known for his blind bias in favor of the </p><p>Israeli viewpoint.  Most of all, it is a sign of </p><p>disrespect and humiliation to all Muslims around the </p><p>world.  We urge the Arab and Muslim world, on all </p><p>levels, to express their anger at this law that is a </p><p>stab in the back of more than one billion Muslims." </p><p> </p><p>-- "America hates the Arabs and not the other way </p><p>around" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/02):  "The latest American decision that considers </p><p>Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital completely destroys U.S. </p><p>credibility as far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is </p><p>concerned.  The American decision is a reward for the </p><p>occupation and for Sharon\'s massacres and bloodshed. </p><p>America has exposed its true nature of its intentions </p><p>towards the Palestinians and the Arabs.  This poses </p><p>the question: why do they (the Americans) hate us </p><p>(Arabs)?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The U.S. is a party in the religious struggle over </p><p>Jerusalem" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/02):  "It is clear that the Zionistic U.S. </p><p>Congress wants to get the U.S. administration involved </p><p>in a long struggle with the Muslim world by imposing </p><p>the Jerusalem provision in the Foreign Relations </p><p>Authorization Act.  The requirement now is an Arab and </p><p>Muslim political campaign that rises up to the level </p><p>of this provocation.  It is the responsibility of the </p><p>Arab and Muslim official authorities to respond to </p><p>this defiance, otherwise, the Muslim people and the </p><p>non-official organizations will respond, and we all </p><p>know how their response would be.  Before Arab and </p><p>Muslim regimes start to criticize terrorism and </p><p>declare their readiness to combat it, they should </p><p>adopt a stand against this rude American provocation </p><p>that shows, once more, the America\'s insolence towards </p><p>the Muslim world." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The American Knesset" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Rashad Abu Daoud writes on the back page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/02):  "Politically speaking, the law recognizing </p><p>Jerusalem as Israel capital is a declaration changing </p><p>the Palestinian and Middle East issue as a whole from </p><p>a regional military and political struggle into a </p><p>religious cause.  It also changes the issue from being </p><p>an issue that has to do with three million </p><p>Palestinians to a declaration of war against a billion </p><p>Muslim around the world." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
