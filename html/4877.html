<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 006149 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MARR, MCAP, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, MARR, MCAP, MOPS, IT, NATO, ITNATO </p><p>SUBJECT: MOD WHITE PAPER: DEFENSE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06149  01 OF 02  271744Z </p><p>REF: ROME 5430 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  ITALY\'S 2002 DEFENSE WHITE PAPER (WP) </p><p>PRESENTS THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AS A PILLAR OF ITALIAN </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY.  THE NATIONAL ARMAMENTS DIRECTOR HAS </p><p>OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFENSE PROCUREMENT AND </p><p>NEGOTIATING INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION </p><p>ACCORDS.  STATE-CONTROLLED COMPANIES AND A FEW LARGE PRIVATE </p><p>FIRMS DOMINATE THE DEFENSE SECTOR, ALTHOUGH A HANDFUL OF </p><p>HIGHLY SPECIALIZED NICHE CONTRACTORS ARE COMPETITIVE.  THE </p><p>GOI SHOULD CONTINUE TO FUND PROGRAMS TO HELP INCREASE EXPORTS </p><p>AND MARKET COMPETITIVENESS, AND NEEDS TO SPEND MORE ON BASIC </p><p>R&D, ACCORDING TO THE WP.  THE WP CALLS FOR GREATER </p><p>INTRA-EUROPEAN COORDINATION OF DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL POLICY, BUT </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME AFFIRMS THAT ITALY WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON </p><p>THE U.S. FOR SOME KEY DEFENSE SYSTEMS.  DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>MARTINO IS COMMITTED TO RATIONALIZING ITALIAN DEFENSE </p><p>PROCUREMENT AND SPENDING SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ON </p><p>BOLSTERING ITALY\'S BATTLEFIELD CAPABILITIES.  THE </p><p>COUNTERVAILING NEED TO PROTECT ITALY\'S INDUSTRIAL BASE AND </p><p>JOBS LIMITS HIS ROOM FOR MANEUVER, HOWEVER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THIS IS ONE IN A SERIES OF REPORTS ON ITALY\'S 2002 </p><p>WHITE PAPER (WP) ON DEFENSE.  THE WP SETS OUT THREE PILLARS </p><p>OF ITALIAN NATIONAL SECURITY:  DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL POLICY, </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY, AND MILITARY POLICY.  UNDER THE MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE, THE NATIONAL ARMAMENTS DIRECTOR (NAD), CURRENTLY </p><p>ADMIRAL GIAMPAOLO DI PAOLA, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06149  01 OF 02  271744Z </p><p>PROCUREMENT.  THE PROCUREMENT BUDGET IS FUNDED THROUGH </p><p>MULTIPLE APPROPRIATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES (MPA).  IN ADDITION TO ACQUISITIONS, </p><p>WHICH ARE BASED ON PROGRAMS DEFINED BY THE CHOD, DI PAOLA </p><p>DIRECTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>SOME 500 PERSONNEL IN THE NATIONAL ARMAMENTS DIRECTORATE.  AS </p><p>THE ITALIAN NAD, DI PAOLA TAKES THE LEAD IN NEGOTIATING </p><p>BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL ACCORDS ON DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE MAJOR STATE-CONTROLLED DEFENSE CONTRACTORS ARE </p><p>FINCANTIERI (SHIPBUILDING) AND FINMECCANICA (AEROSPACE, </p><p>HELICOPTERS, ELECTRONICS, ENERGY, AND TRANSPORT), WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES ALENIA DIFESA AND ALENIA AERONAUTICA, AND ALENIA </p><p>SPAZIO.  THE LARGEST PRIVATE FIRMS ARE FIAT AVIO (VEHICLES, </p><p>PROPULSION SYSTEMS, AND ELECTRONICS); ELETTRONICA (ELECTRONIC </p><p>WARFARE, AVIONICS); MACCHI (TRAINING AIRCRAFT); BERETTA </p><p>(SMALL- AND MEDIUM-CALIBER WEAPONS); AND INTERMARINE (NAVAL </p><p>CONSTRUCTION).  THE WP PUTS MARCONI (ELECTRONICS AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION) IN THIS CAMP, BUT FINMECCANICA IS NOW IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF REABSORBING ITS FORMER SUBSIDIARY.  TOGETHER, </p><p>THESE FIRMS ACCOUNT FOR 80 PERCENT OF ITALY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS, PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 JOBS, AND </p><p>EXPORT EQUIPMENT AND MATERIEL WORTH SOME 1.6 BILLION EUROS </p><p>ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO THE WP.  (COMMENT: A HANDFUL OF SMALL- </p><p>AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES HAVE DEVELOPED INTO SPECIALIZED </p><p>PROVIDERS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEFENSE EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS </p><p>THE ROME-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING FIRM, DATAMAT. </p><p>THESE FIRMS HAVE TYPICALLY SERVED AS SUBCONTRACTORS TO </p><p>FINMECCANICA, BUT MORE THAN A DOZEN ARE COMPETING </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY FOR JSF CONTRACTS UNDER THE "BEST VALUE" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06149  01 OF 02  271744Z </p><p>CONTRACT AWARD SYSTEM.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>SECTOR THROUGH A JOINT PUBLIC GOVERNMENT-PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>WP.  WITHIN THE COMMITTEE, OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS THE GOI WORK </p><p>WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM ACADEMIA AND THE HIGH-TECH SECTOR </p><p>(VIA THE ASSOCIATION FOR AEROSPACE DEFENSE INDUSTRIES) TO SET </p><p>OVERALL DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL POLICY, PROMOTE EXPORTS, AND </p><p>COORDINATE ASSISTANCE TO ITALIAN FIRMS COMPETING FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARMS CONTRACTS.  THE MPA, WITH ITS SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>BUDGET FOR AIDING ITALIAN INDUSTRY, PLAYS A KEY ROLE ON THE </p><p>COMMITTEE.  THE GOI HAS ALSO AIDED THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>SECTOR\'S ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING WITH </p><p>INTERVENTION TO HELP FINANCE DEVELOPMENT, INCREASE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS AND MARKET ACCESS, AND BETTER </p><p>FOCUS COMPANIES ON END-USERS.  BUILDING A STRONGER MILITARY </p><p>R&D BASE IS ANOTHER GOI PRIORITY, ACCORDING TO THE PAPER. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EVEN THOUGH ANNUAL SPENDING HAS </p><p>INCREASED TO 130 MILLION EUROS, ITALY STILL APPROPRIATES MUCH </p><p>LESS THAN OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE WP, ITALY HAS SIGNED 48 BILATERAL </p><p>DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTRIES AS </p><p>DIVERSE AS FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, CHINA, AND SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1466 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  06149  02 OF 02  271745Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AS-01    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------1D67C7  271745Z /38 </p><p>R 271731Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7508 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p>DIA WASHINGTON DC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 006149 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: NATO, PGOV, PREL, MARR, MCAP, MOPS, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: MOD WHITE PAPER: DEFENSE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>TWELVE MORE ARE CURRENTLY BEING NEGOTIATED.  THE GOI SUPPORTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06149  02 OF 02  271745Z </p><p>COORDINATION OF DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL POLICY AT THE EUROPEAN </p><p>LEVEL -- THROUGH OCCAR, LETTERS OF INTENT, AND THE WEST </p><p>EUROPEAN ARMAMENTS GROUP -- BUT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS STILL </p><p>INCHOATE. THE WP ARGUES THAT JUST AS IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO </p><p>DO NATIONAL DEFENSE PLANNING WITHOUT FOCUSING ON </p><p>INTER-SERVICE OPERABILITY, THE INCREASING OVERLAP BETWEEN </p><p>ITALY\'S NEEDS AND THOSE OF ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS MAKES </p><p>INTRA-EUROPEAN PLANNING ESSENTIAL.  HOWEVER, THE GOI WANTS </p><p>THIS ACCOMPLISHED IN A WAY THAT COMPLEMENTS RATHER THAN </p><p>COMPETES WITH THE NATO PLANNING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) COMMERCIALLY, ITALIAN FIRMS ARE LOOKING FOR </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS </p><p>ALONG THE LINES OF THE APRIL 2001 AGREEMENT AMONG </p><p>FINMECCANICA, EADS, AND BAE SYSTEMS TO COOPERATE ON MISSILE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, ACCORDING TO THE WP. (COMMENT: FRUSTRATED WITH </p><p>THEIR INABILITY TO STRIKE EQUITABLE ACCORDS WITH EUROPEAN </p><p>CONTRACTORS, ITALIAN DEFENSE CONTRACTORS ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH U.S. COMPANIES SUCH AS BOEING AND </p><p>LOCKHEED, WHICH ARE VALUED FOR THE ADVANCED R&D THEY BRING TO </p><p>BEAR ON PROJECTS, THE HIGH QUALITY OF PRODUCTION, AND THE </p><p>BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.  FOR EXAMPLE, BOEING AND </p><p>OTOMELARA/FINMECCANICA RECENTLY AGREED TO BEGIN CO-PRODUCTION </p><p>OF JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS IN MARCH 2003.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  WHILE THE GOI WILL LOOK TO THESE ALLIANCES FOR </p><p>PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE WP ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ITALY </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE U.S. MARKET AS A KEY SOURCE FOR </p><p>DEFENSE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF THE COMPETITIVE </p><p>ADVANTAGE HELD IN MANY SECTORS BY AMERICAN CONTRACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  MINDEF MARTINO IS COMMITTED IN PRINCIPLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06149  02 OF 02  271745Z </p><p>TO RATIONALIZING ITALIAN DEFENSE PROCUREMENT AND TO SPENDING </p><p>SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ON BOLSTERING ITALY\'S BATTLEFIELD </p><p>CAPABILITIES.  RECENT ACTIONS (A400M WITHDRAWAL), AGREEMENTS </p><p>(JSF LEVEL II PARTNERSHIP), AND PURCHASES (BOEING 767 </p><p>TANKERS) SUGGEST THAT ITALY IS INDEED MOVING IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION.  HOWEVER, ITALY IS OVERSTRETCHED IN TERMS OF </p><p>PROGRAMS THAT ARE ENTERING THE LATTER STAGES OF PRODUCTION, </p><p>SUCH AS THE EUROFIGHTER COMBAT AIRCRAFT, AND WILL HAVE TO </p><p>MAKE SOME HARD BUDGETARY CHOICES OVER THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  PER REFTEL, MARTINO IS TRYING TO </p><p>SHIFT EVEN MORE OF THE PROCUREMENT BUDGET TO THE MPA AND </p><p>OTHER MINISTRIES.  WHILE CURTAILING PARTICIPATION IN SOME </p><p>EUROPEAN COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMS MIGHT MAKE SENSE FROM A </p><p>COST-BENEFIT STANDPOINT, THIS RUNS COUNTER TO THE INTERESTS </p><p>OF ITALY\'S STATE-DOMINATED AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE INDUSTRY. </p><p>MOREOVER, WITH FIAT\'S AUTOMOBILE SECTOR IN DIRE STRAITS, THE </p><p>GOI WILL BE EVEN MORE AVERSE TO RISKING THE EROSION OF </p><p>ITALY\'S INDUSTRIAL BASE AND SACRIFICING JOBS FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>EFFICIENCY.  IT ALSO MAY WELL BE A POLITICAL BRIDGE TOO FAR </p><p>FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT, DESPITE ITS PRO-U.S. BENT, STILL </p><p>CLAIMS SOME COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A COMMON EUROPEAN DEFENSE. </p><p> SEPTEL WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING MORE PRECISELY THE TRENDS </p><p>WITHIN THE ITALIAN DEFENSE INDUSTRY, COMMERCIAL AND </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY, AND THE NEXUS BETWEEN </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICS, BUSINESS IMPERATIVES, AND DEFENSE </p><p>INDUSTRIAL POLICY.
