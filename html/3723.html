<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 004484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR KURT VOLKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MARR, IT, NATO, ITPREL, NATO, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: WINNING ITALY OVER ON IRAQ -- CORRECTED VERSION </p><p>TECHNICAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04484  01 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>REF: USNATO 0989 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  ITALY IS MOVING CLOSER TO WHERE WE WANT OUR </p><p>NATO ALLIES TO BE ON IRAQ. PM BERLUSCONI, AND INCREASINGLY </p><p>OTHER TOP GOVERNMENT LEADERS, UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGIC </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF NEUTRALIZING IRAQ\'S WMD CAPABILITIES.  THEY </p><p>HOPE WAR CAN BE AVOIDED.   HOWEVER, THROUGH PUBLIC REMARKS </p><p>AND A FORWARD-LEANING COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY, THE GOI IS </p><p>BEGINNING TO PREPARE THE ITALIAN PEOPLE FOR THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT MILITARY ACTION AGAINST BAGHDAD WILL BE TAKEN. </p><p>BERLUSCONI AND DEPUTY PM FINI CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT THE USE </p><p>OF FORCE TO DEFANG IRAQ, PREFERABLY UNDER UN COVER, IS </p><p>WARRANTED IF OTHER APPROACHES FAIL.  ACCELERATED HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SHARING, CLOSE CONSULTATIONS, AND FOCUSED PUBLIC </p><p>OUTREACH ARE KEY TO ENSURING THE GOI KEEPS ITS MESSAGE ON </p><p>TRACK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ITALY WILL BE A HELPFUL PARTNER WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>VISITS EUROPE IN NOVEMBER AND AT THE NATO DEFENSE MINISTERIAL </p><p>LATER THIS MONTH.  TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ESPECIALLY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI, ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON </p><p>IRAQ AND WILL NOT SHY AWAY FROM DISCUSSING IT BENEFICIALLY IN </p><p>A NATO CONTEXT.  EVEN IN THIS FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GAME IS NOT OVER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS FRONT, BERLUSCONI AND HIS </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS TEAM ARE DOING A COMMENDABLE JOB OF PREPARING </p><p>THE ITALIAN PEOPLE FOR POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04484  01 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S LATEST FORAY--A SIGNED FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE IN AN </p><p>ITALIAN DAILY SEPTEMBER 11--CONDEMNED IRAQ\'S SYSTEMATIC </p><p>VIOLATION OF ITS UN OBLIGATIONS, ARGUED THAT THE USE OF FORCE </p><p>TO AFFECT CHANGE SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED, AND AVERRED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WHICH CALL FOR PREVENTIVE </p><p>ACTION.  "THINGS EITHER CHANGE," HE SAID, "OR IT WILL BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO ACT IN A CONCRETE MANNER, WITH EVERY POSSIBLE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL VEHICLE, AND WITHOUT EXCLUDING THE </p><p>MILITARY OPTION." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) LATER, COMMENTING PUBLICLY ON THE PRESIDENT\'S UN </p><p>SPEECH, BERLUSCONI SAID HE WAS SURE THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>WOULD NOT HESITATE TO IMPOSE INSPECTIONS ON IRAQ NOR TO </p><p>AUTHORIZE THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN THE EVENT SADDAM </p><p>CONTINUES TO FLOUT ITS RESOLUTIONS.  ASKED DIRECTLY WHETHER </p><p>ITALY WOULD TAKE PART IF THERE WAS AN ATTACK, BERLUSCONI </p><p>HEDGED:   "LET\'S WAIT AND SEE," HE SAID. "AT THE RIGHT TIME </p><p>ITALY, ALONG WITH ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS, WILL TAKE THE RIGHT </p><p>DECISION."  OTHER KEY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS--WHO HAVE THEIR </p><p>OWN POLITICAL ORCHARDS TO TEND--ARE BEGINNING TO ADOPT MORE </p><p>FORWARD-LEANING POSITIONS.  DEPUTY PM FINI, LEADER OF THE </p><p>SECOND LARGEST PARTY IN THE GOVERNING COALITION, SAID IN </p><p>PUBLIC REMARKS AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE ON SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>THAT, "IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM THE USE OF MILITARY </p><p>FORCE IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PRESIDENT CIAMPI, A KEY OPINION MAKER AND INDEPENDENT </p><p>FROM BERLUSCONI\'S GOVERNMENT, HAS HEWED TO A MORE CIRCUMSPECT </p><p>PUBLIC POSITION, BUT NEVERTHELESS UNDERSCORED ITALY\'S STRONG </p><p>SOLIDARITY WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM IN REMARKS COMMEMORATING SEPTEMBER 11.  DURING AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04484  01 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>OFFICE CALL BY THE AMBASSADOR AND DCM PRIOR TO PUBLIC </p><p>CEREMONIES ON SEPTEMBER 11, CIAMPI SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO </p><p>FIGHT TERROR BUT ALSO TO ERADICATE IT FROM THE "MINDS AND </p><p>HEARTS" OF ITS POTENTIAL RECRUITS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>FIGHTING TERRORISM INCLUDED, IN HIS OPINION, ACTING TO </p><p>DESTROY WMD, WHILE WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS MEANT ADDRESSING </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE.   WE MAY HEAR MORE OF THIS TWO-TRACK APPROACH IN </p><p>COMING WEEKS AS GOI POLITICAL LEADERS WORK TO BUILD PUBLIC </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION IS SPLIT BETWEEN THOSE </p><p>OPPOSED TO WAR AT ALL COSTS, AND OTHERS--NOTABLY LEADERS OF </p><p>THE LARGEST LEFT-WING PARTY--WHO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IF </p><p>AUTHORIZED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT </p><p>AS AN EXTREME MEASURE.  THE CENTER-LEFT DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>SUFFICIENT WEIGHT IN THE PARLIAMENT TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HOSTAGE ON KEY FOREIGN POLICY MATTERS.  HOWEVER, ON A MATTER </p><p>OF SUCH GRAVITY, BERLUSCONI WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN ROUGHSHOD </p><p>OVER THE OPPOSITION, NOR IS HE SO INCLINED.  ASSISTING THE </p><p>GOI BUILD BROAD POLITICAL BACKING FOR OUR IRAQ POLICY WILL </p><p>HELP ENSURE THAT ITALIAN SUPPORT IS DELIVERED AND CAN BE </p><p>SUSTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TO THAT END, PURSUING THE TACTICS RECOMMENDED IN </p><p>REFTEL, SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY DEPLOYED IN ITALY, IS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5751 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04484  02 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------E71C4B  131740Z /38 </p><p>O 131719Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5842 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR KURT VOLKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, NATO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: WINNING ITALY OVER ON IRAQ -- CORRECTED VERSION </p><p>TECHNICAL </p><p> </p><p>ESSENTIAL.  FOLLOWING BERLUSCONI\'S IN-DEPTH INTELLIGENCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04484  02 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>BRIEFING ON IRANIAN AND IRAQI WMD PROGRAMS SEPTEMBER 13 IN </p><p>NEW YORK, AND HIS MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AT CAMP DAVID ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 14, HE SHOULD BE EVEN MORE WILLING TO LISTEN TO </p><p>ARGUMENTS ON THE NEED TO CHANGE COURSE ON IRAQ, ESPECIALLY </p><p>UNDER US SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTION.  NEVERTHELESS, WE NEED TO </p><p>AND CAN DO MORE.  CONTINUED CLOSE CONSULTATIONS ARE </p><p>ESSENTIAL.  WE ALSO WOULD APPRECIATE AN EVEN RICHER </p><p>INTELLIGENCE EXCHANGE WITH SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS TO GENERATE </p><p>DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS POSED BY WMD TO ITALIAN </p><p>AND, MORE BROADLY, EUROPEAN SECURITY.  RECENT POLLING DATA ON </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MILITARY ACTION IS CONFLICTING.  ONE </p><p>SURVEY PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 12 SHOWED 59 PERCENT AGREED A </p><p>"PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION IN IRAQ" WOULD BE JUSTIFIED, WHILE </p><p>ANOTHER THE SAME DAY SAID 66 PERCENT OPPOSED MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> TWO THINGS, HOWEVER, ARE CLEAR: PUBLIC OPINION IS IN FLUX </p><p>AND A WELL-TARGETED, AND, WE DARE SAY, RELENTLESS PA EFFORT </p><p>CAN AFFECT IT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT.  THE GOI WILL DO ITS UTMOST TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE EU ARRIVES AT A UNIFIED POSITION ON IRAQ.  IN THE EVENT </p><p>THAT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE, OUR ACE IS THAT BERLUSCONI </p><p>UNDERSTANDS--AND SHOULD APPRECIATE EVEN MORE AFTER HIS </p><p>MEETINGS IN THE UNITED STATES--THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>DEFANGING BAGHDAD.  MOREOVER, BERLUSCONI HAS DEMONSTRATED A </p><p>CAPACITY FOR LEADING PUBLIC OPINION ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES </p><p>HE KNOWS ARE MAKE OR BREAK FOR US.  HE AND OTHER KEY GOI </p><p>LEADERS, HOWEVER, REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESTABILIZING </p><p>POTENTIAL OF WAR IN THE NEAR EAST.  THEIR PREFERENCE IS TO </p><p>AVOID IT.  REASSURING THEM THAT WE HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS AND ARE COMMITTED TO POST-CONFLICT </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION--AND PROVIDING RELEVANT POINTS FOR THE GOI TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04484  02 OF 02  131740Z </p><p>USE IN ITS PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORTS--WILL BRING PAYOFFS.
