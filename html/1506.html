(C) MDC MP BITI TOLD POLOFF THAT HE EXPECTS THE </p><p>GOZ/ZANU-PF TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS IN DELAYING HIGH </p><p>COURT ACTION ON THE LEGAL CHALLENGES.  HE WOULD NOT BE </p><p>SURPRISED, FOR INSTANCE, IF PRESIDENT MUGABE ENCOURAGED </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO PASS A LAW PROHIBITING ANY CHALLENGES TO LAST </p><p>JUNE\'S RESULTS.  SUCH A LAW WOULD CLEARLY BE </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BITI SAID, BUT IT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>CASES IN THE HIGH COURT WOULD AGAIN COME TO A HALT UNTIL </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN THE NEW LAW.  IN A SEPARATE </p><p>CONVERSATION, MDC SENIOR ADVISOR GANDI MUDZINGWA TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE GOZ\'S GOAL IS TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP DELAYING HIGH </p><p>COURT ACTION UNTIL THE MDC GIVES UP THIS FIGHT IN ORDER TO </p><p>CONCENTRATE ITS SEVERELY LIMITED RESOURCES ON THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HAD THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>RULED ANY OTHER WAY, AS MUGABE\'S DECREE WAS A CLEAR </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.  WE WERE TAKEN ABACK, </p><p>HOWEVER, BY THE SUBDUED REACTION FROM THE MDC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WITH WHOM WE SPOKE.  THEIR EXPECTATION, </p><p>THOUGH, THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO DELAY </p><p>ACTION IN THE HIGH COURT IS WELL-PLACED.  THE MDC WOULD </p><p>ONLY HAVE TO WIN 20 BY-ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE A </p><p>MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT, AND THE GOZ WANTS TO AVOID THIS </p><p>POSSIBILITY AT ALL COSTS.   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00613  02 OF 02  121328Z </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
