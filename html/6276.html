<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, GT, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA NOT LIKELY TO ASSIST ON IRAQ RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 63629 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 370 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Rob Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Although the GOG has informally indicated support for </p><p>Iraq\'s unconditional need to comply with UNSCR 1441, it has </p><p>remained non-committal on US/UK/Spanish resolution on Iraq. </p><p>Were we to press Guatemala we believe it might play an </p><p>unhelpful role.  We therefore did not urge GOG participation </p><p>in the Security Council session mentioned in Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Hamilton discussed Secretary Powell\'s UNSC </p><p>presentation of the case against Iraq with then-Acting </p><p>President Reyes on February 6 (Ref B).  In that meeting Reyes </p><p>chose not comment substantively on the GOG\'s position on </p><p>Iraq.  The DCM twice raised the issue of Iraqi non-compliance </p><p>with Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez after the February 7 </p><p>and 14 presentations by Secretary Powell to the U.N. Security </p><p>Council.  On both occasions Gutierrez expressed appreciation </p><p>for translated transcripts of the Secretary\'s presentations </p><p>but studiously avoided any comment as to GOG policy towards </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
