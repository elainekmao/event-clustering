<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000274 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, ZI, KPAO KMDR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL EVIDENCE AGAINST IRAQ; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Powell fails to prove case against </p><p>      Baghdad" the pro-government daily "Daily Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its February 7 editorial to dismissing </p><p>      Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s testimony against </p><p>      Iraq, saying, Powell\'s presentation was "flawed" and </p><p>      "did not have any shred of evidence."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "United States Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s </p><p>      theatrical presentation of what he said was </p><p>      evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction was unconvincing to say the least. </p><p>      It was full of assumptions and presumptions, and </p><p>      therefore the United Nations should not sanction </p><p>      war against a sovereign nation, Iraq, on the </p><p>      basis of Powell\'s flawed presentation.  To say </p><p>      the truth, Powell did not have any shred of </p><p>      evidence, he was just whipping emotions.  Armed </p><p>      with data from the Iraqi defectors, spy </p><p>      satellites and telephone intercepts, his </p><p>      presentation lagged far behind the expectations </p><p>      of the world, real evidence that would justify a </p><p>      war. . .  Logically, if the U.S. has no hidden </p><p>      agenda, it should agree to increase the </p><p>      capabilities of monitoring and collecting </p><p>      information on Iraqi territory.  Political </p><p>      decisions should be based on facts and evidence, </p><p>      and definitely not on egocentric beliefs.  Who </p><p>      says the `so-called evidence\' cannot be </p><p>      concocted, especially in this age of high </p><p>      technology?  As for the photographs of what </p><p>      Powell called weapons sites and mobile weapons </p><p>      factories, why is it that the information had </p><p>      not been presented to the U.N. arms inspectors </p><p>      for verification? </p><p> </p><p>      "We believe it is folly for Powell, who is not </p><p>     in Iraq, to accuse the Iraqis of hiding biological </p><p>     and chemical weapons when the U.N. inspectors, who </p><p>     are practically scrounging for proof in that </p><p>     country, have not found any shred of evidence </p><p>     since.  It should be noted that weapons of mass </p><p>     destruction are not like an aspirin tablet that </p><p>     you can hide in your pocket.  They are weapons </p><p>     that cannot be concealed easily.  Without wanting </p><p>     to pacify Iraq, its response has been more </p><p>     convincing.  Since the Gulf War numerous </p><p>     inspections have been conducted but no weapons of </p><p>     mass destruction have been found.  So, could the </p><p>     assertion by Iraq that Powell\'s presentation was </p><p>     `unrelated to the truth\' be truth.  Powell\'s </p><p>     presentation, created two camps, with Britain, as </p><p>     expected, supporting the U.S. while China, Russia </p><p>     and France are insisting that there was need to </p><p>     find convincing evidence. . .  It should be asked: </p><p>     to what extend do the nature and scope of the </p><p>     threat justify the recourse to war and how does </p><p>     the U.N. make sure that the considerable risks of </p><p>     such intervention are actually kept under </p><p>     control?" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
