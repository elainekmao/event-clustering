<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 003241 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/27/08 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHIC REPORT: LUIS MIQUILENA: POLITICAL GODFATHER TO </p><p>HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>LUIS MIQUILENA:  CHAVEZ\'S RIGHT HAND MAN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) LUIS MIQUILENA IS LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HUGO </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S POLITICAL GODFATHER AND CONFIDENT.  HE WAS THE KEY </p><p>INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN CHAVEZ AND LEFTIST POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO THE FAILED FEBRUARY 1992 COUP ATTEMPT.  HE ALSO ORGANIZED </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S 1994 VISIT TO CUBA FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON. </p><p>SINCE THEN, HE HAS WORKED TO BUILD A POLITICAL BASE FOR CHAVEZ, </p><p>HELPING TO TRANSFORM CHAVEZ\'S BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT- </p><p>2000 (MBR-2000) INTO A POLITICAL PARTY--THE FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT </p><p>(MVR), AND BUILDING ALLIANCES WITH LEFT AND CENTER-LEFT PARTIES </p><p>SUCH AS THE HOMELAND FOR ALL (PPT) AND THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS </p><p>SOCIALISM (MAS).  CHAVEZ TRUSTS MIQUILENA AND RELIES ON HIM TO VET </p><p>VISITORS, SET CAMPAIGN PRIORITIES, AND MANAGE HIS POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  HE HAS NAMED MIQUILENA HEAD OF CAMPAIGN ADMINISTRATION </p><p>AND FINANCE.  IF ELECTED, IT IS RUMORED THAT MIQUILENA WOULD BECOME </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR (IN CHARGE OF VENEZUELA\'S CIVILIAN SECURITY </p><p>APPARATUS AND NEXT IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE FORMATIVE YEARS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE SEPTUAGENARIAN MIQUILENA IS OF THE SAME POLITICAL </p><p>GENERATION AS PRESIDENT CALDERA AND DEMOCRATIC ACTION PARTY </p><p>CANDIDATE LUIS ALFARO.  BORN IN CORO, FALCON STATE, IN 1919, </p><p>MIQUILENA STARTED HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND </p><p>THE NASCENT TRADE UNION MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IN THE 1940\'S MIQUILENA WAS A PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE </p><p>POWERFUL BUS DRIVERS UNION OF CARACAS.  HE SPEAR-HEADED SEVERAL </p><p>STRIKES DURING THE ISAIAS MEDINA ANGARITA REGIME.  AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>MAINSTREAM COMMUNISTS WERE SUPPORTING MEDINA, MIQUILENA, AN AVOWED </p><p>COMMUNIST, PRESSURED THE MEDINA AND HIS RULING JUNTA FOR CHANGE </p><p>THROUGH THE THREAT OF CRIPPLING TRANSPORTATION STRIKES.   HE WAS </p><p>HARASSED BY STATE SECURITY AGENTS, PLAYING A CAT AND MOUSE GAME, </p><p>AND WAS JAILED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) NEITHER A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION NOR JAIL TIME SOFTENED </p><p>MIQIUILENA.  HE CONFRONTED THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF ROMULO BETANCOURT </p><p>AND WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST PRISONERS OF THIS REGIME. </p><p>UPON HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1946, HIS FAILURE TO RESPECT THE </p><p>RESOLUTIONS OF THE FIRST COMMUNIST CONGRESS ALIENATED THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY, AND HIS RADICAL SPLINTER GROUP OF TROTSKYITES, THE BLACK </p><p>COMMUNISTS, WERE EXPELLED BY THE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) IN THE MIDST OF THIS TURMOIL, MIQUILENA ORGANIZED AND LED </p><p>THE 1947 CARACAS BUS DRIVERS STRIKE, PARALYZING THE CAPITAL FOR </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR.  THROUGH THIS ACTION, </p><p>MIQUILENA WAS ABLE TO SECURE FOR THE UNION MEMBERSHIP THE SAME </p><p>WORKING CONDITIONS AND BENEFITS THAT OTHER WORKERS WERE AFFORDED BY </p><p>THE NEW LABOR LAW BUT HAD BEEN DENIED TO BUS DRIVERS. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>MIDDLE AGE </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) FOLLOWING HIS OUSTER FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, MIQUILENA </p><p>HELPED FOUND THE REPUBLICAN UNION MOVEMENT (URD), A LEFTIST </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY SUPPORTED BY URBAN PROFESSIONALS WHICH BECAME THE </p><p>MODEL FOR THE PPT AND THE MAS.  MIQUILENA WON A SEAT IN THE </p><p>CONGRESS FOLLOWING THE 1958 FALL OF THE PEREZ JIMENEZ DICTATORSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) DURING THIS PERIOD, MIQUILENA WAS ALSO IN CONTACT WITH </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S GROWING GUERILLA MOVEMENT.  HE WAS ACCUSED BY HIS </p><p>ENEMIES OF MANAGING GUERILLA FUNDS AND USING THE URD AS AN URBAN </p><p>POLITICAL FRONT FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  THESE SAME ENEMIES TRACE </p><p>MIQUILENA\'S FORTUNE TO THIS PERIOD, ALLEGING THAT HE ABSCONDED WITH </p><p>GUERILLA MONEY FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ARMED MOVEMENT, AND </p><p>THAT HE USED HIS POSITION AS DIRECTOR OF THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTE OF </p><p>POPULAR CREDIT (IMCP) TO EMBEZZLE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY.  HE WAS </p><p>NEVER CHARGED WITH ANY SUCH CRIME. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IN THE SIXTIES, MIQUILENA FORMED AN IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP </p><p>WITH JOSE VICENTE RANGEL.  TOGETHER THEY FOUNDED THE NEWSPAPER EL </p><p>CLARIN, WHICH WAS THE MOUTHPIECE FOR LEFTIST POLITICS.  AGAIN, HIS </p><p>ENEMIES ACCUSED HIM OF USING EL CLARIN TO SUPPORT ARMED SUBVERSION. </p><p>WHEN RANGEL MADE HIS UNSUCCESSFUL RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 1973, </p><p>MIQUILENA WAS HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>THE GOLDEN YEARS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) UNTIL RECENTLY, MIQUILENA HAS BEEN LIVING THE LIFE OF A </p><p>WEALTHY CATTLE RANCHER IN BARINAS STATE, CHAVEZ\'S HOME STATE.  IT </p><p>WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT HE MET CHAVEZ AND TOOK HIM UNDER HIS </p><p>WING.  DURING CHAVEZ\'S PLANNING FOR HIS 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, </p><p>MIQUILENA MANAGED CHAVEZ\'S EFFORTS TO BUILD CIVILIAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HIS MILITARY INSURRECTION.  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THIS COURTING </p><p>WAS THE RADICAL CAUSE PARTY (LCR), WHICH REJECTED CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>OVERTURES, FEARING THAT A FAILED COUP WOULD SHORT-CIRCUIT LCR\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO CREATE A POLITICAL PROFILE FOR ITSELF INDEPENDENT OF THE </p><p>RULING POLITICAL PARTIES:  COPEI AND AD. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) FOLLOWING THE FAILED COUP, AND DURING CHAVEZ\'S TIME IN </p><p>PRISON, MIQUILENA KEPT IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE COUPSTER. </p><p>MIQUILENA SAW IN CHAVEZ THE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH HE COULD BREAK </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL PARTY STRANGLEHOLD ON VENEZUELAN POLITICS.  VIEWING </p><p>CHAVEZ AND "CHAVISMO" AS A SOCIAL MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD SWAMP </p><p>TRADITIONAL POLITICS, MIQUILENA HAS FOLLOWED A TWO-STAGE STRATEGY. </p><p>FIRST, HE BURNISHED CHAVEZ\'S RADICAL CREDENTIALS--ORGANIZING A TRIP </p><p>TO CUBA AND MAINTAINING LINKS TO RADICAL LEFTIST PARTIES.  THIS WAS </p><p>DESIGNED TO CREATE A POLITICAL PROFILE FOR CHAVEZ DRAMATICALLY </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM HIS COMPETITORS IN THE LCR, PPT, AND MAS.  SECOND, </p><p>ONCE ESTABLISHED AS A MAJOR CANDIDATE, MIQUILENA OVERSAW CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO BUILD HIS OWN POLITICAL PARTY AND TO ALLY HIMSELF WITH </p><p>PPT AND MAS--THUS PROVIDING CHAVEZ A MEANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 8 REGIONAL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CHAVEZ HAS MADE MIQUILENA DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATION FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND THE MVR.  MIQUILENA HAS USED </p><p>HIS OWN WEALTH TO HELP FINANCE THE CAMPAIGN, BUT HAS ALSO </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY REACHED OUT TO OTHER WEALTHY FARMERS AND BUSINESSMEN </p><p>TO PROVIDE MONEY TO THE CAMPAIGN.  CHAVEZ RELIES ON MIQUILENA TO </p><p>MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS CLEAN, AND THAT HE CANNOT BE CHARGED WITH </p><p>SOLICITING OR ACCEPTING DIRTY MONEY.  MIQUILENA HAS DONE HIS JOB, </p><p>SO FAR, VERY WELL, AND HAS PROTECTED HIS CANDIDATE.  HE REMAINS ONE </p><p>OF THE FEW FIGURES WHOM CHAVEZ TRUSTS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A </p><p>KEY ROLE IN THE MVR, THE CAMPAIGN, AND POSSIBLY THE GOVERNMENT, AS </p><p>LONG AS HIS HEALTH HOLDS UP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
