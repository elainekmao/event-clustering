<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ACCRA 000570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, IO, GH, UNHCR, refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: PRM/DAS KELLY RYAN\'S MEETINGS WITH OPE STAFF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  PRM/DAS Kelly Ryan visited Accra, Ghana on </p><p>February 28 - March 4 to review U.S. Resettlement </p><p>Program (USRP) operations in West Africa.  This cable is </p><p>one in a series of cables outlining meetings, </p><p>discussions and impressions gleaned from the visit. </p><p>Provided with various opportunities for consultations </p><p>with Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) staff over the </p><p>five-day period, Ryan came away with an appreciation of </p><p>numerous challenges faced following the events of 9/11. </p><p>Increased security checks, the implementation of RAVU, </p><p>limited access to refugee camps and expired medical </p><p>reports added to a significant delay in processing. </p><p>Despite the obstacles nearly 20,000 refugees were </p><p>processed in FY02 indicating the motivation and </p><p>professionalism is there among OPE colleagues to move </p><p>the program in the right direction.  Addressing OPE </p><p>concerns with WRAPS will also keep momentum going.  As a </p><p>result, DAS Ryan came away with a feeling of optimism </p><p>that once the backlog of stalled cases are cleared, the </p><p>operation will move more quickly. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>OPE BRINGS NEW STAFF ON BOARD TO FACE POST 9/11 </p><p>CHALLENGES </p><p> </p><p>2.  In background discussions with Refcoord, DAS was </p><p>debriefed on the history of OPE/Accra\'s office.  Only </p><p>two years old, OPE inherited processing responsibilities </p><p>from the Joint Voluntary Agency (JVA) in Nairobi.  Both </p><p>OPE and JVA were awarded cooperative agreements under </p><p>the auspices of Church World Service (CWS) based in NY. </p><p>Within this brief two year period, CWS changed the </p><p>leadership at OPE by replacing previous OPE Director </p><p>Regine McCalla with current Director Frances Tinsley. </p><p>Arriving with a strong background in domestic refugee </p><p>resettlement, Tinsley\'s posting in January of this year </p><p>provided a much-needed boost to OPE operations as it had </p><p>been without a permanent director for nearly six months. </p><p>Tinsley\'s ability to hit the ground running allowed OPE </p><p>to confront processing issues needing immediate </p><p>attention.  Tinsley\'s deputy, Lucie Gagne also brings </p><p>extensive refugee experience to OPE as she has worked at </p><p>both UNHCR and JVA in W. African operations over the </p><p>past six years. </p><p> </p><p>FY 02 OBSTACLES TO SPEEDIER PROCESSING </p><p> </p><p>3.RAVU - Refcoord explained the myriad of issues and </p><p>policy concerns that surfaced following the events of </p><p>9/11.  Acknowledging OPE\'s efforts to address the </p><p>rapidly changing USG policy on resettlement, Refcoord </p><p>informed DAS that despite some Herculean efforts, </p><p>refugees were not moving through the pipeline very </p><p>quickly.  With the much-needed creation of the Refugee </p><p>Access Verification Unit (RAVU) at INS, now called the </p><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), all Priority 3 </p><p>(P3) cases were being reviewed for fraud and thus, </p><p>thousands of cases were stalled, while relationship </p><p>claims are being verified with DHS records.  Department </p><p>and DHS expect final resolution of the cases within the </p><p>coming month with word that approval rate of cases </p><p>reviewed by RAVU may be less than 50 per cent.  Once </p><p>this backlog of file review is finalized, OPE and other </p><p>processing partners look forward to processing refugees </p><p>in a timelier manner and with a lower rate of fraud. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Increased Security Provisions  - The USRP has seen a </p><p>number of new security initiatives enacted in the wake </p><p>of 9/11.  As efforts to vet security advisory opinions </p><p>(SAOs) became more cumbersome, OPE as well as other </p><p>processing entities, saw a slow-down in the movement of </p><p>refugees while SAOs trickled in. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Restricted Access to Refugee Camps - Throughout the </p><p>past fiscal year DHS interviews have been limited to </p><p>sites approved by both the post regional security </p><p>officer (RSO) and the DHS.  As a result, much time and </p><p>effort was spent securing acceptable interview sites in </p><p>Accra, Conakry, Banjul and Abidjan.  Collaboration on </p><p>these efforts were laudable as evidenced by the DHS </p><p>circuit ride in Abidjan last year.  When DHS could not </p><p>get to the refugees, the refugees were brought to them. </p><p>Partners successfully moved and processed over 4,000 </p><p>refugees residing in camps in the north of Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>by moving the caseload to Abidjan for adjudication. The </p><p>caseload consisted almost entirely of P-3 Liberians with </p><p>one UNHCR P-1 referral.  Further collaboration allowed </p><p>the processing of smaller caseloads at </p><p>embassies/consulates in Nigeria, the Central African </p><p>Republic, Mali and Niger.  Some of those cases had been </p><p>waiting for processing for years. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Ban on Priority One Cases from UNHCR - Following the </p><p>resettlement scandal at UNHCR/Accra, the Department </p><p>placed a ban on all processing of P-1 Referrals in W. </p><p>Africa.  This ban was in effect for most of FY 02 and </p><p>contributed to the slowing down of processing and </p><p>departures.  Upon DHS review of all UNHCR/Accra cases </p><p>and implemented investigative/corrective measures by </p><p>UNHCR, the Department lifted the ban late last year. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Expired Medical Reports - The majority of refugee </p><p>medical examinations have a validity period of one year, </p><p>with certain cases only having six months.  The </p><p>cessation of departures inevitably led to thousands of </p><p>cases needing second medical exams as the validity </p><p>period came and went.  OPE worked closely with the </p><p>International Office of Migration (IOM) to sift through </p><p>records to determine at which point the case cleared </p><p>RAVU and then needed another medical examination. </p><p>Following the review, thousands of applicants throughout </p><p>W. Africa were rescheduled for medical examinations with </p><p>country panel physicians. </p><p>8.  Cross-Referenced Cases - Due to the high number of </p><p>cases that were linked, OPE soon discovered that if one </p><p>family was not cleared for departure either for waiting </p><p>for security approval, medical re-examination or RAVU </p><p>approval, neither case would be allowed to travel. </p><p>Acknowledging the size of many refugee families, this </p><p>obstacle proved significant in the slowing down of </p><p>processing.  (Comment: This issue is being tackled in </p><p>part, by Tinsley who maintains that many cases were </p><p>inappropriately hard cross-referenced by OPE staff prior </p><p>to her arrival. End comment) </p><p> </p><p>DESPITE OBSTACLES, 20,000 PROCESSED IN FIVE MONTHS </p><p> </p><p>9.  Despite the numerous challenges faced by OPE and </p><p>partners during the past fiscal year, 19,500 refugees </p><p>were processed in just five months.  In addition, </p><p>interviews were conducted in nine countries throughout </p><p>W. Africa.  Consolidation of Visas 92 and Visas 93 </p><p>efforts at OPE has also nearly eliminated a 10 year </p><p>backlog at post. Initially handed approximately 600 </p><p>Visas 92 and 93 cases, OPE has sifted through the </p><p>caseload and in collaboration with Post, resolved most </p><p>of the cases.  OPE expects to move all several hundred </p><p>eligible Visas 92 and 93 cases this fiscal year. </p><p> </p><p>FY 03 - RESOLVING OLD ISSUES, STREAMLINING FUTURE </p><p>OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p>10. RAVU Revoked cases - OPE informed DAS Ryan that </p><p>approximately 70 per cent of previously approved cases </p><p>in W. Africa are expected to be revoked in the coming </p><p>months.  Furthermore, of those cases not yet </p><p>interviewed, at least 50 per cent will never make it </p><p>past RAVU to the INS interview stage.  While this </p><p>reduction in the pipeline will affect previous </p><p>projections significantly, OPE believes it can still </p><p>complete processing for and move 4,000 people this </p><p>fiscal year. </p><p> </p><p>11. WRAPS Needs Tweaking - OPE data staff provided DAS </p><p>Ryan with an overview of concerns regarding the newly </p><p>implemented World Wide Refugee Admissions Processing </p><p>System (WRAPS).  While seeing WRAPS as a necessary </p><p>improvement from the old system, OPE outlined technical </p><p>delays in design construction that have caused </p><p>difficulty in maneuvering through the system.  Refcoord </p><p>confirmed with OPE that most concerns involved technical </p><p>improvements scheduled for the future that had not been </p><p>made in what OPE viewed as a timely manner.  DAS Ryan </p><p>took OPE\'s concerns on board and promised to raise </p><p>concerns with Washington upon her return.  (Note: </p><p>Refcoord has raised OPE\'s concerns with WRAPS program </p><p>Manager Amy Nelson who is considering sending an </p><p>additional team to OPE/Accra as a follow up to initial </p><p>installation.  A similar effort was successfully made in </p><p>Moscow to tweak the system and provide a training review </p><p>for OPE staff. End Note) </p><p> </p><p>12.  Cultural Orientation - Cultural Deputy Director </p><p>Emily Russ provided DAS Ryan with an overview of </p><p>operations in W. Africa.  Confirming that refugees were </p><p>only scheduled for CO after clearing RAVU, Russ </p><p>described the curriculum, which includes a heavy </p><p>emphasis on self-sufficiency and U.S. law.  Russ was </p><p>pleased to be developing a new section for youths. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Comment:  It is clear that the obstacles facing OPE </p><p>and the USRP as a whole during FY 02 were significant. </p><p>While these obstacles contributed to frustration among </p><p>partners, domestic voluntary agencies and refugees </p><p>alike, it appears that the frustration may soon ebb. </p><p>Methodically and collaboratively working through the </p><p>challenges and resolving the thousands of cases pending </p><p>RAVU and security clearances will release the logjam in </p><p>the system.  Despite OPE\'s concerns with the WRAPS </p><p>network, it appears that the problems as outlined are </p><p>scheduled to be resolved as each successive build is </p><p>completed.  In the interim, the possibility of a second </p><p>WRAPS TDY support visit might be just the trick needed </p><p>to tweak the system and assuage OPE concerns.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
