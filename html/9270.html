THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT </p><p>FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE USG CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>2. In preparation for the forthcoming meetings of the </p><p>North American Energy Working Group (NAEWG) and U.S.- </p><p>Canada Energy Consultative Mechanism (ECM) in Ottawa </p><p>July 15-17, post provides the following updated </p><p>overview of the very dynamic Canadian energy scene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CANADIAN ENERGY OVERVIEW </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. Since the early 1980\'s, Canada has been the single </p><p>largest foreign supplier of energy to the United </p><p>States; measured in total energy, it is our number one </p><p>energy supplier by a wide margin.  Canada is the </p><p>world\'s fifth largest energy producer and a net </p><p>exporter of all major energy products including oil and </p><p>petroleum products, natural gas, electric power, </p><p>uranium, and energy technology and services.  The </p><p>United States is virtually Canada\'s sole customer for </p><p>crude oil and natural gas exports, which grew steeply </p><p>over the past decade and a half, as well as its sole </p><p>customer for exports of electric power. </p><p> </p><p>4. Canadian and U.S. government efforts are coordinated </p><p>across the full range of energy-related technologies </p><p>including climate monitoring, carbon sequestration, </p><p>clean coal, hydrogen and nuclear.  Canada has been </p><p>invited to participate in the Carbon Sequestration </p><p>Leadership Forum (CSLF) and the International </p><p>Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE). </p><p> </p><p>5. OIL:  Canada supplies more oil and oil products to </p><p>Americans than any other country, including Saudi </p><p>Arabia.  In 2002 Canada exported approximately 1.4 </p><p>million barrels per day of crude oil, plus the </p><p>equivalent of about 500,000 barrels per day in </p><p>petroleum products and partially processed oil.  In </p><p>2002, imports of Canadian oil and petroleum products </p><p>accounted for about about 17 percent of U.S. oil </p><p>imports and nearly 10 percent of total U.S. oil demand. </p><p> </p><p>6. GAS:  Natural gas makes up the largest part - more </p><p>than one-third - of Canada\'s primary energy production. </p><p>In 2002 Canada exported 3.74 trillion cubic feet of </p><p>natural gas, making up 93 percent of U.S. gas imports </p><p>and 18 percent of total U.S. gas demand.  (See ref F </p><p>for a Canadian perspective on North American gas supply </p><p>issues). </p><p> </p><p>7. ELECTRIC POWER:  Canada exported about 35 terawatt- </p><p>hours of electric power to the United States in 2002. </p><p>Canada\'s total electricity exports peaked in 2000 and </p><p>are now on a declining trend, due to changes in demand </p><p>patterns, a lack of capital investment in both the U.S. </p><p>and Canadian electric power industries and the </p><p>difficulty of building new transmission capacity (see </p><p>ref N for analysis). </p><p> </p><p>8. NUCLEAR:  Canada is the world\'s largest uranium </p><p>producer (ref A), supplying about one-third of world </p><p>production and 20 to 30 percent of U.S. demand.  A </p><p>Canadian Government-owned firm, AECL, is one of the </p><p>world\'s most active vendors of nuclear reactors, having </p><p>supplied units to China and South Korea in the past </p><p>decade. </p><p> </p><p>9. For further data on Canadian energy production and </p><p>trade, refer to the EIA\'s Country Analysis Brief on </p><p>Canada (www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/canada.html), or the </p><p>GOC\'s National Energy Board website (www.neb.gc.ca). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10. Canada has been invited to participate in the IPHE. </p><p>Working-level GOC officials appear to be cautiously </p><p>interested, but have significant concerns about how IPHE </p><p>will relate to the IEA\'s Hydrogen Coordination Group (ref </p><p>B).  They also have numerous questions about IPHE\'s possible </p><p>structure and process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHIFTING TO OILSANDS AND FRONTIERS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. Canada\'s conventional oil and gas fields are mainly </p><p>located in or adjacent to the western province of </p><p>Alberta, which is north of Montana.  While the cost of </p><p>finding new reserves in this region has risen </p><p>significantly in recent years, the industry continues </p><p>to thrive, notably in the less-exploited northwestern </p><p>portion of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin which </p><p>extends into the neighboring province of British </p><p>Columbia.  A relatively new energy/mining technology, </p><p>the extraction of oil from oilsands (vast deposits of </p><p>oily dirt) in northern Alberta, became profitable </p><p>during the 1990\'s.  Multi-billion-dollar investments </p><p>are ongoing in that industry.  See paragraphs 16-19 </p><p>below for details. </p><p> </p><p>12. The ability of supplies to keep up with North </p><p>America\'s natural gas demand has been the subject of </p><p>recent controversy in Canada, as it has in the United </p><p>States.  There is now broad, well-developed support </p><p>among stakeholders to construct a pipeline down the </p><p>Mackenzie River Valley, which would allow development </p><p>of natural gas fields in the Mackenzie River Delta and </p><p>Beaufort Sea areas (east of Alaska\'s North Slope).  The </p><p>first formal steps toward applying for regulatory </p><p>approval for such a pipeline are expected to be taken </p><p>in the second half of 2003.  While the amount of gas </p><p>which will be accessed by this pipeline is a fraction </p><p>as large as that in Prudhoe Bay, the barriers to </p><p>pipeline development are lower, and the gas could begin </p><p>to reach southern markets around 2010. </p><p> </p><p>13. Substantial oil and gas deposits under the </p><p>continental shelf off Canada\'s Atlantic coast entered </p><p>commercial production in the past decade, highlighted </p><p>by the placement of a large fixed platform on the </p><p>"Hibernia" oilfield (east of Newfoundland) in 1997, and </p><p>the inauguration of natural gas exports from Nova </p><p>Scotia to New England through the Maritimes and </p><p>Northeast Pipeline early in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>14. The Hibernia oilfield, which is being exploited by </p><p>a consortium of private oil firms (Exxon/Mobil is the </p><p>operator), is estimated to contain more than 600 </p><p>million barrels of oil.  Major oil firms are now </p><p>beginning production from the nearby "Terra Nova" </p><p>oilfield, which has reserves of about 300-400 million </p><p>barrels.  Conservative estimates put East Coast </p><p>discovered reserves of oil in the two billion barrels </p><p>range, with possible eventual production rates of up to </p><p>one million barrels per day. </p><p> </p><p>15. Offshore natural gas production from the Sable </p><p>Island area, east of Nova Scotia, began early in 2000. </p><p>Most of this gas is exported to New England - bringing </p><p>large-scale natural gas service to these states for the </p><p>first time, and helping to stabilize their winter </p><p>heating costs.  Gas reserves around Sable Island have </p><p>been estimated at 3.5 trillion cubic feet, but more </p><p>drilling is needed to complete this picture (ref H). </p><p>There are much larger gas resources in Newfoundland and </p><p>Labrador, but environmental and distance problems will </p><p>slow these developments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OILSANDS:  CONTINUING EXPANSION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. The economically recoverable oil resources in </p><p>Alberta\'s oilsands are many times larger than the sum </p><p>of Canada\'s other oil reserves.  Oilsands (aka </p><p>"tarsands" or "heavy oil") are vast deposits of oily </p><p>dirt which can be processed (economically at current </p><p>oil prices) into "synthetic crude" which can then be </p><p>refined in conventional oil refineries.  Canadian </p><p>authorities estimate reserves in the oilsands to be the </p><p>equivalent of 175 billion barrels assuming current </p><p>technology and economic conditions, and up to 315 </p><p>billion barrels with technological advances and some </p><p>price increases.  Oilsands already account for more </p><p>than half of Canada\'s crude oil output, and for most of </p><p>the recent increases in Canada\'s production. </p><p> </p><p>17. Crude bitumen production from oilsands increased by </p><p>about 25 percent in 2002, due to large ongoing capital </p><p>investments.  The Canadian government has predicted </p><p>that if currently planned projects are realized, by </p><p>2010 Canada will provide approximately 20.5 percent of </p><p>U.S. oil imports and 14.1 percent of total U.S. oil </p><p>supply.  The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board </p><p>projects that synthetic crude oil production from </p><p>Alberta\'s oilsands will expand by 237 percent from 2002 </p><p>to 2012. </p><p> </p><p>18. During the past year, first Oil and Gas Journal and </p><p>subsequently the U.S. Energy Information Administration </p><p>began to recognize Canada\'s oil sands as "proven </p><p>reserves" -- a decision which dramatically increases </p><p>Canada\'s petroleum reserves on paper, to about 180 </p><p>billion barrels, making Canada the world\'s second- </p><p>largest reserve holder after Saudi Arabia.  While the </p><p>validity of counting the oilsands as "proven reserves" </p><p>has been subject to some ongoing controversy (notably </p><p>following a critical item by Jeff Gerth in the New York </p><p>Times on June 18), their economic reality is affirmed </p><p>by the many billions in actual capital investment which </p><p>they are attracting and the resulting current increases </p><p>in oil output. </p><p> </p><p>19. COMMENT:  There is growing confidence among </p><p>Canadian stakeholders and analysts that this resource </p><p>imposes an effective limit on the price which North </p><p>America must pay for overseas oil in the long run, </p><p>absent severe foreign supply disruptions.  Embassy </p><p>shares this view.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARCTIC PIPELINES:  MACKENZIE LINE CLOSER TO REALITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>20. IN RECENT MONTHS, STAKEHOLDERS IN AN ANTICIPATED NATURAL </p><p>GAS PIPELINE DOWN THE MACKENZIE RIVER VALLEY IN NORTHWESTERN </p><p>CANADA HAVE TAKEN FURTHER STEPS TO PAVE THE ROAD FOR A </p><p>FORMAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL.  TRANSCANADA PIPELINES (TCPL), </p><p>ONE OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST PIPELINE OPERATORS, SIGNED A DEAL </p><p>IN JUNE TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO ABORIGINAL PIPELINE GROUP </p><p>(APG), ENABLING APG TO TAKE A ONE-THIRD OWNERSHIP SHARE IN </p><p>THE PIPELINE.  THE MAIN PRODUCING PARTNER IS IMPERIAL OIL, </p><p>THE CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON.  AN INITIAL APPLICATION TO </p><p>REGULATORS IS EXPECTED IN THE FALL OF 2003. </p><p> </p><p>21.  STAKEHOLDERS LESS AND LESS VIEW THE MACKENZIE LINE AND </p><p>ANOTHER, LARGER PIPELINE TO ALASKA\'S PRUDHOE BAY AS BEING </p><p>INCOMPATIBLE.  THIS IS BECAUSE IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY </p><p>LIKELY THAT THE SMALLER AND SHORTER MACKENZIE LINE WILL BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTED FIRST, AND BECAUSE THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN </p><p>THAT NORTH AMERICA\'S DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS MAY OUTSTRIP </p><p>SUPPLIES OVER THE COMING DECADE (REF F).  CANADIAN </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO POSSIBLE FISCAL INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>ALASKA PIPELINE FOCUS ON THE POSSIBLE MARKET-DISTORTING </p><p>EFFECTS OF SUCH SUBSIDIES - PARTICULARLY IF THEY GO BEYOND </p><p>THE SCOPE OF MEASURES TAKEN TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN OTHER </p><p>GAS PRODUCING REGIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ELECTRICITY:  RESTRUCTURING SKIDS IN ONTARIO </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22. Electric power is primarily under provincial </p><p>jurisdiction in Canada, and is traditionally dominated by </p><p>provincial government-owned firms.  Several provinces have </p><p>taken steps to restructure their electricity sectors on </p><p>competitive principles.  Alberta has achieved a degree of </p><p>competition at both wholesale and retail levels which has </p><p>been characterized as a "messy success" (ref J). </p><p> </p><p>23. In Ontario in recent years, the provincial monopoly </p><p>utility was split up into generation, transmission and </p><p>distribution components, and some competition was introduced </p><p>at the retail level.  However, in April 2002 a planned </p><p>initial public offering of the provincial government-owned </p><p>transmission grid operator, Hydro One, was blocked by a </p><p>court ruling.  Transmission grid issues quickly became </p><p>politicized, particularly when power prices rose during the </p><p>peak summer period.  In November 2002, the Ontario </p><p>government froze retail power rates at 4.3 cents/KWH for </p><p>most customers until 2006.  Since then, the government has </p><p>struggled to increase generating capacity with little help </p><p>from private investment.  Re-starting mothballed nuclear </p><p>plants is crucial to its survival strategy, but the first re- </p><p>starts - expected this summer and fall - have been delayed. </p><p> </p><p>24. Canada\'s National Energy Board (NEB) predicts that </p><p>domestic electricity demand will grow slightly faster than </p><p>supply through 2025, causing electricity exports to the </p><p>United States to decline significantly from current levels </p><p>in the long run.  This is driven by the trend for generating </p><p>facilities to be located closer to end users.  One major </p><p>reason for this is the difficulty of constructing new </p><p>transmission capacity due to a range of concerns including </p><p>environmental/agricultural opposition, regulatory hurdles, </p><p>and uncertainty associated with the evolving market </p><p>environment for electric power.  Another is the growing </p><p>availability of natural gas and the efficiency of gas-driven </p><p>generating technology. </p><p> </p><p>25. Canada still has abundant undeveloped hydroelectric </p><p>potential, but these resources tend to be located far from </p><p>densely populated markets.  Provinces with large undeveloped </p><p>sites include Newfoundland and Labrador (Churchill Falls </p><p>II), Quebec (Great Whale) and Manitoba (Nelson River). </p><p>There is significant potential for cogeneration of electric </p><p>power in oilsands operations, but here as well, it will be </p><p>difficult for the resulting power to reach major markets </p><p>unless construction of long-distance power lines becomes </p><p>easier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NUCLEAR:  MOVING FORWARD ON LONG-TERM DISPOSAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>26. Like the United States, Canada has no permanent disposal </p><p>facility for its nuclear waste, which is currently stored at </p><p>reactor sites.  As in the U.S., proposals to move this waste </p><p>to any other site(s) provoke strong local resistance. </p><p>During 2002, Canada passed legislation which creates a Waste </p><p>Management Organization, funded by nuclear energy firms, to </p><p>develop a long-term approach to storing radioactive waste. </p><p>The GOC plans to make a decision by 2006 in favor of one of </p><p>the three major options (deep geological storage, </p><p>centralized surface/subsurface, or continued storage at </p><p>reactor sites). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLIMATE CHANGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  In the spring of 2002 the USG and GOC announced a more </p><p>concerted effort to coordinate our climate change programs, </p><p>with a particular focus on energy, especially energy </p><p>efficiency, clean energy, clean coal, renewable and </p><p>alternative energy and carbon sequestration.  At Prime </p><p>Minister Chretien\'s initiative, Canada formally ratified the </p><p>Kyoto Accord at the end of 2002, despite vocal criticism </p><p>from provincial governments and industries (with Alberta and </p><p>the oil and gas sector leading the way - ref L).  Critics </p><p>were concerned that the burden of compliance would fall </p><p>disproportionately on certain regions/industries and also </p><p>that compliance would place Canada\'s economy at a lasting </p><p>competitive disadvantage vis--vis the United States. </p><p> </p><p>28. In its spring 2003 budget, the GOC committed C$1.5 </p><p>billion (about US$1 billion) over five years directly to </p><p>achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions, plus modest </p><p>additional funds for research and long-term technology </p><p>development.  GOC officials are now engaged in determining </p><p>what process will be used to allocate this spending. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
