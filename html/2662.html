REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WAS CHARGED WITH TREASON ON </p><p>MARCH 20 IN THE ALLEGED PLOT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE HARARE CENTRAL POLICE STATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOR FINGERPRINTING, THEN APPEARED AT THE HARARE MAGISTRATE\'S </p><p>COURT, WHICH FORMALLY CHARGED HIM WITH THE CAPITAL CRIME.   HE </p><p>WAS RELEASED ON A BAIL OF Z$1.5 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY U.S. </p><p>$5,000), AND WAS ORDERED TO SURRENDER THE TITLE DEED TO HIS </p><p>HOUSE, WORTH Z$3 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $10,000). </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS ALSO ORDERED TO RELINQUISH HIS PASSPORT AND TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>REPORT TO THE POLICE ONCE A WEEK.  THE PARTY\'S SHADOW AGRICULTURE </p><p>MINISTER AND MP FOR GWERU RURAL, RENSON GASELA, WAS ALSO CHARGED </p><p>WITH TREASON BY THE SAME COURT.  HE WAS RELEASED ON Z$ 500,000 </p><p>BAIL (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $1500) AFTER BEING ORDERED TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS AS TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE -- WHO WAS HIMSELF </p><p>RECENTLY CHARGED WITH TREASON IN THE SAME CASE -- PUBLICLY </p><p>DESCRIBED THE FILING OF CHARGES AGAINST TSVANGIRAI AS "AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO CONTINUE HARASSING THE MDC LEADERSHIP IN ORDER TO STOP US FROM </p><p>RESISTING AN ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION PROCESS."  TSVANGIRAI SPECIAL </p><p>ADVISOR GANDI MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT TSVANGIRAI, GASELA, AND </p><p>NCUBE WILL APPEAR IN COURT ON APRIL 30 FOR AN INTERIM HEARING ON </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH BAIL CONDITIONS, BUT THAT NO TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN </p><p>SET. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MEANWHILE, MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00748  211859Z </p><p>FACILITATOR FOR THE INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE HAD ARRIVED ON MARCH 20 </p><p>AND THAT THE NIGERIAN FACILITATOR WAS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE IN THE </p><p>NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THE MDC PLANNED TO SHARE WITH THEM THE LIST OF </p><p>NEGOTIATING PRINCIPLES DESCRIBED BY THEIR MP DAVID COLTART IN A </p><p>MARCH 19 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR (REF A).   SEVERAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE KEY LEADERSHIP THEN PLAN TO HOLD A ONE-DAY RETREAT </p><p>NEAR THE SOUTHWESTERN CITY OF BULAWAYO MARCH 22-23 TO DETERMINE </p><p>NEXT STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THE FILING OF TREASON CHARGES AGAINST TSVANGIRAI </p><p>LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER ZIMBABWE\'S SUSPENSION FROM THE COUNCILS </p><p>OF THE COMMONWEALTH DOES NOT AUGUR WELL FOR NEAR-TERM POLICY </p><p>CHANGES BY PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S GOVERNMENT NOR FOR THE LIKELY </p><p>SUCCESS OF INTER-PARTY TALKS.  WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENTS MBEKI AND </p><p>OBASANJO TRIED TO PERSUADE MUGABE TO DROP THE FLIMSY CHARGES </p><p>AGAINST TSVANGIRAI AND OTHER MDC LEADERS AS A CONFIDENCE-BUILDING </p><p>MEASURE, BUT THE ZIMBABWEAN LEADER RESISTED, APPARENTLY </p><p>EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR THE CASE TO MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THE </p><p>COURTS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
