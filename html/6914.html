On 26 March, the Regional Coordinator for UNICEF/Iraq </p><p>convened a water/sanitation meeting in collaboration with </p><p>the HOC USACE.  The limited effectiveness of treatment </p><p>plants combined with the shortage of technical capability in </p><p>Iraq for repairs and management means that water and sewage </p><p>are major humanitarian concerns. A small DART assessment </p><p>team went to Umm Qasr on 27 March to survey health </p><p>facilities, water, and food.  The USAID Reconstruction Team </p><p>and the DART are coordinating on emergency water delivery </p><p>for Umm Qasr, Basra, and other southern Iraq locations.  The </p><p>docking of the U.K. ship, the Sir Galahad, at Umm Qasr is </p><p>now expected to occur on 28 March.  The Kuwaiti Red Crescent </p><p>Society went to Umm Qasr on 27 March to reexamine their </p><p>relief distribution plans after the difficulties encountered </p><p>in the commodity distributions on 26 March.  The Kuwait </p><p>Ministry of Health intends to establish a field hospital at </p><p>the UNIKOM compound near Umm Qasr.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 26 March, the Regional Coordinator for the United </p><p>Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF)/Iraq convened a </p><p>water/sanitation meeting in collaboration with the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) and the U.S. Army Corps </p><p>of Engineers (USACE).  The meeting was attended by DART </p><p>health officers and several NGOs, including the </p><p>International Medical Corps, GOAL, Caritas, and the </p><p>International Federation of the Red Cross. UNICEF and USACE </p><p>presented capabilities for restoration of water to southern </p><p>Iraq, including assessments, the water pipe from Kuwait, </p><p>water tank trucks, chlorine tablets, and jerry cans. </p><p>According to UNICEF, water and sewage treatment plants </p><p>normally have only 30 to 40 percent effectiveness, and there </p><p>is a shortage of technical capability in the country for </p><p>repairs and management.  Water and sewage could be an </p><p>important issue in the event of damage during conflict in </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On 26 March, the UNICEF Coordinator for UNICEF/Iraq also </p><p>met with members of the Health Fusion Cell and the DART to </p><p>discuss the status of health, water, and education in Iraq; </p><p>existing local capacities; and planning for the post- </p><p>conflict Ministry of Health. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A small DART assessment team went to Umm Qasr on 27 </p><p>March to survey health facilities, water, and food. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OPERATION CENTER (HOC) DAILY BRIEFING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  There has been a 24-hour delay in the docking of the Sir </p><p>Galahad at the port of Umm Qasr.  Poor weather conditions </p><p>have slowed the demining process.  The ship is now expected </p><p>to dock on 28 March with 231 metric tons (MT) of relief </p><p>supplies including food, medicine, plastic sheeting, </p><p>blankets, jerry cans, and water. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A representative of the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society </p><p>stated that efforts would be made on 27 March to reexamine </p><p>the relief distribution plans for Umm Qasr and Safwan after </p><p>the difficulties encountered in the commodity distributions </p><p>in both towns on 26 March.  Although seven trucks of </p><p>food, water, and medical supplies were distributed in Umm </p><p>Qasr and five trucks in Safwan, the unorganized nature of </p><p>the distribution led to crowd-control problems.  It is </p><p>expected that additional distributions will take place on 28 </p><p>March if a more organized system can be developed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Kuwait Ministry of Health intends to establish a </p><p>field hospital at the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer </p><p>Missions (UNIKOM) compound near Umm Qasr.  The hospital is </p><p>expected to have 40 beds, four ambulances, and stock </p><p>approximately 12 tons of medical supplies and equipment. </p><p>Medical services to be provided will include an intensive </p><p>care unit, surgery, pediatric care, obstetrics, radiology, </p><p>and a medical laboratory. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Although the extension of the water pipeline from Kuwait </p><p>is not expected to be completed until 30 March, tankers </p><p>could begin to truck water from the border to Umm Qasr as </p><p>early as 27 March, if an agreement could be reached with </p><p>UNICEF.  A fleet of 30 to 40 trucks, carrying an average of </p><p>24,000 liters, is expected to provide the potable water </p><p>until the completion of the three-kilometer pipeline. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Four of the seven oil well fires have now been </p><p>extinguished in southern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>USAID - RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  It is expected that the port of Umm Qasr will be </p><p>declared "permissive" within the next 48 hours.  If true, </p><p>USAID\'s ports contract manager will proceed to the port with </p><p>a military escort to begin USAID\'s preliminary port </p><p>assessment and prepare the way for the arrival of the SSA </p><p>port management contractor. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The USAID Reconstruction Team and the DART are </p><p>coordinating on emergency water delivery for Umm Qasr, </p><p>Basra, and other southern Iraq locations.  The DART can </p><p>deliver water tankers, while USAID, with the mobilization of </p><p>its logistics contract, can reportedly procure as much as </p><p>900,000 liters of bottled water in Kuwait for shipment to </p><p>points in southern Iraq within 24 hours if needed, security </p><p>permitting.  The USAID Reconstruction Team will consult the </p><p>DART assessment and other information prior to proceeding. </p><p>USAID\'s emergency water response capacity is expected to be </p><p>a major benefit in the near-term capacity to deliver </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p>13. The USAID Reconstruction Team is helping the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) identify </p><p>Jordanian interpreters for use in southern Iraq through the </p><p>assistance of FBIS and the USAID Mission in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
