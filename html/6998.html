<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: NIGERIA ENERGY UPDATE, March 31 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS:     A: Abuja 558 </p><p>          B: Lagos 624 </p><p>          C: Lagos 568 </p><p>          D: Abuja 555 </p><p>          E: Lagos 499 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This update includes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- When Will the Oil Flow? Delta Crisis Update </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Running on Empty: Refineries, Power Company and </p><p>Consumers Face Same Plight </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Deep Water Deals: Joint Development Zone Advances </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>When Will the Oil Flow? Delta Crisis Update </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Although the violence that has wracked the </p><p>Escravos region of the Niger Delta the last two weeks </p><p>appears to have subsided, oil companies remain hesitant </p><p>to return their employees to facilities in the swamps. </p><p>This situation is causing Nigeria\'s crude oil </p><p>production to be at least 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) </p><p>below normal(ref A).  The DOE\'s Energy Information </p><p>Administration (EIA) has put the loss as high as </p><p>900,000 bpd. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Shell </p><p>has told its customers that it may delay loading of </p><p>crude oil from the region through May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A ChevronTexaco representative told Econoff </p><p>March 31 that the company has left a very small care </p><p>and maintenance crew in place at the tank farm in </p><p>Escravos, and will decide within the next two or three </p><p>days if it is safe to begin re-staffing the facility. </p><p>After such a decision is made, the company will ship </p><p>food, supplies and fuel to the facility in advance of </p><p>workers.  The representative admits the pressure to </p><p>reopen operations is enormous, and personally discounts </p><p>reports that ChevronTexaco or Shell Oil will wait until </p><p>after the elections to start lifting from the region </p><p>again.  Officials from both companies have said they </p><p>would need specific assurances that their people would </p><p>be safe before returning them to the Delta.  In a </p><p>separate conversation, the Dutch Consul General told </p><p>the ConGen that Shell is demanding those assurances </p><p>from the highest levels of the Nigerian government and </p><p>from leaders of the warring communities in the Niger </p><p>Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Our ChevronTexaco contact also reported March </p><p>31 that calm has been restored in the area for several </p><p>days, as both federal and state government officials </p><p>negotiate with Ijaw representatives over ways to keep </p><p>the peace.  Our contact said the federal government </p><p>deployed additional troops to maintain order, but the </p><p>facilities to maintain and transport the troops are so </p><p>poor that this fact causes problems. Because the oil </p><p>companies are sometimes asked to assist with lodging </p><p>and moving troops, they fear they may appear complicit </p><p>in military operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) According to a Reuters dispatch, Delta State </p><p>governor James Ibori attributes the recent attacks on </p><p>Itsekiri villages by militant Ijaws to a government </p><p>effort to check illegal oil bunkering.  Ibori </p><p>reportedly claimed that prominent persons employ local </p><p>youths to tap into oil pipelines and siphon products </p><p>for sale on the black market.  Shell Oil is </p><p>particularly vulnerable to such practices as it </p><p>utilizes an extensive aboveground oil pipeline network. </p><p>Other reports indicate that the violence broke out </p><p>after an Ijaw ultimatum for redrawing electoral wards </p><p>expired, after which armed youths blockading the </p><p>Escravos River exchanged gunfire with military and </p><p>police forces escorting vessels through the waterways </p><p>(refs B, C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Comment: While it appears that the situation in </p><p>the swamps between Warri and Escravos has been calm for </p><p>four or five days, the oil companies will not rush to </p><p>return their workers to the region without greater </p><p>assurances of safety and restoration of relative peace. </p><p>Some Ijaw leaders have indicated a willingness to cease </p><p>hostilities if the military refrains from retaliation </p><p>against Ijaw villages.  But othe Ijas arecalling for </p><p>mass action to disrupt national elecions scheduled to </p><p>begin in two weeks, including ttacks against oil </p><p>facilities, which so far have enerally been spared in </p><p>the ethnic clashes.  Whie the military forces </p><p>initially appeared unwillig to egage or pursue the </p><p>Ijaw militants (ref D) President Obasanjo declared </p><p>that he will bring o justice the persons responsible </p><p>for the conflict and for the death of military </p><p>personnel.  The ucertainty of the likely courses of </p><p>action by theplayers creates a precarious security </p><p>situation in the region.  The oil companies will </p><p>carefully weigh the risk of renewed violence against </p><p>the need to move oil out of the Delta facilities. </p><p>Predicting how soon oil flows will return to normal </p><p>remains as difficult as predicting the likelihood that </p><p>peace will last in the Delta.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Running on Empty: Refineries, Power Company and </p><p>Consumers Face Same Plight </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Recent clashes in the Delta have highlighted </p><p>Nigeria\'s woefully inadequate refining capacity. </p><p>According to a Chevron-Texaco representative, the </p><p>closure of that company\'s Escravos transfer station and </p><p>tank farm effectively shut down the government\'s </p><p>refinery at Warri, as it and the refinery at Kaduna </p><p>began running on their reserves sometime last week. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation </p><p>(NNPC) reported that it was forced to cut power to much </p><p>of Lagos last week when a gas feeder pipeline that </p><p>fuels the Egbin power plant was vandalized.  While </p><p>Nigeria\'s aggregate refining capacity is 445,000 bpd in </p><p>theory, chronic maintenance problems plague Nigeria\'s </p><p>four refineries.  Consequently, Nigeria imports almost </p><p>half of the refined petroleum products it consumes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Last month, in response to worldwideincreases </p><p>in the market price of refined petroleum products, </p><p>suppliers diverted Nigeria\'s expected imports to higher </p><p>paying customers.  This action caused a massive fuel </p><p>shortage and gasoline queues not seen since Nigeria </p><p>returned to democratic rule three years ago (ref E). </p><p>Although the Managing Director of NNPC reportedly </p><p>claims there is no fuel shortage, gas lines and power </p><p>outages continue.  Angry consumers accuse filling </p><p>station owners of employing street boys to extort extra </p><p>money from consumers waiting in line to buy fuel.  The </p><p>Managing Director of Mobil Oil told the ConGen that </p><p>although his station managers control the forecourts, </p><p>the queues of cars that stretch for blocks belong to </p><p>opportunistic thugs selling places in line. With no </p><p>reprieve in sight, black market fuel sellers are </p><p>becoming increasingly prolific throughout urban areas </p><p>like Lagos as consumers scramble to keep their cars </p><p>running and their back-up generators for homes and </p><p>businesses humming. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) About two weeks ago at a meeting called by the </p><p>NNPC, executives of the major downstream operators said </p><p>they would not re-enter the fuel importation business </p><p>unless the government allows for import price parity. </p><p>The federal government sets the maximum price that can </p><p>be charged at the pump for fuel.  The company </p><p>executives said that to cover their costs, they would </p><p>need to charge 37 naira per liter of gasoline, well </p><p>above the current 26-naira pump price. Consequently, </p><p>the NNPC remains essentially the sole importer of fuel. </p><p>One daily paper reported last week that the NNPC lost </p><p>52.4 billion naira ($416 million) on fuel imports in </p><p>the first nine months of 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Comment.  The ongoing fuel shortage and recent </p><p>trouble in the Delta have focused new light on the </p><p>utter inefficiency of Nigeria\'s oil refineries.  The </p><p>crises have also rekindled discussion of the possible </p><p>sale of these government owned enterprises to private </p><p>downstream operators, which might then establish import </p><p>price parity (ref E). Since the national elections are </p><p>only a few weeks away, we will not likely see any </p><p>movement in this direction.  The industry unions </p><p>vociferously oppose privatization, and no government </p><p>leader will want to be responsible for a 43 percent </p><p>increase in consumer pump prices. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Deep Water Deals: Joint Development Zone Advances </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>11. (U) Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe are moving </p><p>closer to developing resources in the Joint Development </p><p>Zone (JDZ) established in the waters of the Gulf of </p><p>Guinea.  The treaty establishing the JDZ was signed in </p><p>2001, but disagreements over details of the treaty and </p><p>an accompanying memorandum of understanding stalled </p><p>progress last year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Estimates of the total crude oil reserves in </p><p>the zone range from six to ten billion barrels.  The </p><p>treaty calls for the two countries to share most </p><p>revenue from the zone on a 60/40 split in favor of </p><p>Nigeria, but it must provide additional concessions to </p><p>Sao Tome and Principe in exchange for total rights over </p><p>the most prolific exploration bloc.  Last year, Sao </p><p>Tome President Fradique de Menezes expressed </p><p>dissatisfaction with the terms of the MOU and what he </p><p>felt was Nigeria\'s slow fulfillment of other pledges. </p><p>These disagreements were apparently resolved in </p><p>February of this year, and seismic and exploration </p><p>agreements are being renegotiated.  It is expected that </p><p>nine blocs will be offered when the countries\' </p><p>negotiators approve a licensing round anticipated in </p><p>the coming months.  We understand that ExxonMobil has </p><p>secured a preferential oil bloc through negotiations </p><p>with Sao Tome and Principe.  A representative of a </p><p>Nigerian firm, Chrome Energy and its Houston-based </p><p>subsidiary Environmental Remediation Holding </p><p>Corporation, told Econ staff two weeks ago that his </p><p>company is moving forward with exploration in the zone </p><p>(septel to follow). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
