<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 09/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PGOV, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: CONGEN MEETING WITH THICH HUYEN QUANG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY EMI L. YAMAUCHI, CG; REASON 1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: CONSUL GENERAL AND POLOFF VISITED THICH </p><p>HUYEN THQ (THQ) AT THE PHUOC QUANG PAGODA IN QUANG NGAI </p><p>PROVINCE ON SEPTEMBER 6. THQ WAS CANDID AND FEISTY IN </p><p>DESCRIBING HIS HEALTH AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS </p><p>CONFINEMENT.  HE CRITICIZED THE GVN\'S "CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02255  01 OF 02  170852Z </p><p>AND POLICIES ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM." </p><p>ACCORDING TO THQ, HE WOULD BE WILLING "TO CONSIDER" MOVING </p><p>BACK TO HIS HOME PROVINCE OF BINH DINH ONCE THE GVN </p><p>PRESENTS HIM WITH AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT DETAILING WHY HE HAS </p><p>BEEN DETAINED, THAT HE HAS FULFILLED THE TERMS OF HIS </p><p>DETENTION, AND THAT HE IS FREE TO TRAVEL.  POST UNDERSTANDS </p><p>THAT GVN AUTHORITIES REFUSED A EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT </p><p>DELEGATION\'S REQUEST FOR A MEETING WITH THQ DURING THIS </p><p>SAME TIMEFRAME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON SEPTEMBER 6, CONGENOFFS MET WITH THQ IN A ROOM </p><p>WITH A LONG TABLE, CHAIRS, AND BOOKCASES, SITUATED ACROSS A </p><p>COURTYARD FROM THE MAIN PAGODA.  A POLICE STATION STANDS </p><p>OPPOSITE THE PAGODA\'S OUTER GATE, ABOUT 200 FEET AWAY.  AT </p><p>ONE END OF THE ROOM WERE A BED AND SOME OTHER SMALL </p><p>FURNISHINGS.  PROVINCIAL ESCORTS FROM THE EXTERNAL </p><p>RELATIONS OFFICE AND QUANG NGAI\'S "COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>MANAGEMENT" ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) WHILE THQ SAID HIS HEALTH WAS DETERIORATING (DUE </p><p>MOSTLY TO OLD AGE, HE NOTED RUEFULLY), HE APPEARED TO BE IN </p><p>GOOD HEALTH FOR A MAN OF 83 YEARS.  HE GREETED CONGENOFFS </p><p>STANDING UNASSISTED IN A DRIVING RAIN, SAT UPRIGHT </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE 50-MINUTE MEETING, AND ROSE SPRYLY TO SEE </p><p>OFF HIS VISITORS.  HE WAS ALERT AND COHERENT AT ALL TIMES, </p><p>BUT APPEARED HARD OF HEARING (ALTHOUGH THIS COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE HARD RAIN AND WIND).  THQ\'S PRIMARY MEDICAL </p><p>COMPLAINTS WERE AN INCREASING LOSS OF SENSATION IN HIS </p><p>RIGHT HAND FINGERS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND EPISODES OF </p><p>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.  FROM TIME TO TIME, HE EXPERIENCED </p><p>SOME NUMBNESS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BODY.  STILL, HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02255  01 OF 02  170852Z </p><p>NOTED HIS AILMENTS DID NOT KEEP HIM FROM WRITING BOOKS ON </p><p>BUDDHIST RITUALS.  HE SAID HE RECEIVED REGULAR MEDICAL CARE </p><p>AND MEDICATIONS AND HAD NEVER BEEN DENIED PERMISSION TO </p><p>VISIT A DOCTOR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) WHILE THE MAJORITY OF HIS TRIPS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>PAGODA WERE FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION, THQ MENTIONED TWO LOCAL </p><p>TRIPS WITHIN THE LAST YEAR TO MY LAI AND THE DUNG QUAT </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ZONE.  IN WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN STAGED FOR OUR </p><p>BENEFIT, THE QUANG NGAI RELIGIOUS MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE </p><p>ESCORT REMINDED THQ THAT HE HAD JUST GONE TO QUANG NGAI </p><p>TOWN THE DAY BEFORE TO VISIT WITH A FELLOW MONK.  THQ SAID </p><p>HE LED A NORMAL LIFE, READING RELIGIOUS TRACTS AND </p><p>RECEIVING REGULAR VISITORS.  LATER ON, HE SAID HE HAD VERY </p><p>FEW VISITORS, ASIDE FROM THE YOUNG NUNS AND MONKS WHO CAME </p><p>FOR A FEW HOURS EACH DAY TO COOK AND CLEAN.  THESE YOUNG </p><p>FOLLOWERS ROTATED ABOUT EVERY 15 DAYS.  THQ LIVES ALONE, </p><p>WITH NO ACCESS TO TELEPHONE OR MAIL.  HE HAD BEEN INFORMED </p><p>OF CONGENOFFS\' UPCOMING VISIT BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) REGARDING THE BASIS FOR HIS CONFINEMENT, THICH </p><p>HUYEN QUANG EMPHASIZED THAT HE WAS UNDER DETENTION FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS - NOT POLITICAL - REASONS.  HE IS UNABLE TO LEAVE </p><p>THE PAGODA WITHOUT POLICE PERMISSION.  THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>VISIT, THQ REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN DETAINED </p><p>BY THE "FRENCH COLONIAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME MORE </p><p>THAN 30 YEARS AGO."  HE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE REASONS </p><p>FOR HIS CURRENT DETENTION AND HAD NEVER SEEN AN OFFICIAL </p><p>DOCUMENT DETAILING THE CHARGES AND SENTENCE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THQ, NO ONE HAD EVER EXPLAINED THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH </p><p>HE COULD TRAVEL/MOVE.  THUS, WHENEVER HE WAS INVITED TO GO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02255  01 OF 02  170852Z </p><p>ELSEWHERE, HE TOLD PEOPLE HE COULD NOT LEAVE.  OTHER </p><p>PAGODAS WERE HESITANT TO INVITE THQ BECAUSE THEY KNEW HE </p><p>COULD NOT MOVE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE RELIGIOUS MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE ESCORT </p><p>INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT THQ HAD BEEN OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO RETURN TO BINH DINH PROVINCE (HIS HOME PROVINCE) LAST </p><p>YEAR, BUT "HAD CHANGED HIS MIND."  THQ CONTRADICTED HIM, </p><p>POINTING OUT THAT HE HAD MERELY ASKED TO SEE HIS OFFICIAL </p><p>CHARGING DOCUMENT, TO KNOW THE REASONS FOR HIS ARREST AND </p><p>LENGTH OF DETENTION "BEFORE MAKING UP HIS MIND."  THQ MADE </p><p>IT CLEAR THAT HE COULD NOT COMMIT TO A MOVE UNTIL HE HAD </p><p>SEEN OFFICIAL PAPERS DETAILING THE REASONS FOR HIS </p><p>DETENTION, CERTIFICATION THAT HE HAD COMPLETED THE </p><p>DETENTION SUCCESSFULLY AND HAD BEHAVED CORRECTLY, AND </p><p>CONFIRMATION OF HIS FREEDOM TO TRAVEL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THICH HUYEN QUANG STATED THERE HAD BEEN NO </p><p>(POSITIVE) CHANGES IN VIETNAM WITH REGARD TO ELECTIONS, </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, OR HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE SAID THE GVN HAD </p><p>NOT ALLOWED THE UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV) </p><p>TO OPERATE AFTER 1975, AND THAT FEWER PEOPLE NATIONWIDE </p><p>WENT TO WORSHIP.  WHEN ASKED HOW HE REGARDED THOSE WHO </p><p>BELONGED TO THE GVN-RECOGNIZED BUDDHIST CHURCH, THQ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2124 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02255  02 OF 02  170853Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------E8554F  170853Z /38 </p><p>R 170845Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7568 </p><p>INFO ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>CRITICIZED THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF AS STATE-RUN (SOMETHING </p><p>"CREATED OUT OF EXPEDIENCY, IN A TIME OF NEED"), BUT </p><p>EMBRACED ITS FOLLOWERS AS "ALL OUR PEOPLE."  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>OTHERS IN VIETNAM OR OVERSEAS WERE AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK FOR </p><p>HIM, THQ RESPONDED VAGUELY THAT THERE WERE OUTSIDE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT SPOKE ON HIS BEHALF. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02255  02 OF 02  170853Z </p><p>9.  (SBU) THE PROVINCIAL ESCORTS ATTEMPTED TO INTERRUPT </p><p>WHEN THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS STRAYED "TOO FAR FROM </p><p>GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S HEALTH."  BUT </p><p>CONGENOFFS AND THQ PRESSED ON.  AT THE END, THE ESCORTS </p><p>ENCIRCLED THQ\'S CHAIR TO SPEED UP THE FAREWELLS.  THQ SAID </p><p>HE WOULD WELCOME A RETURN VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  THIS WAS CONGENOFFS\' FIRST MEETING WITH </p><p>THICH HUYEN QUANG.  WHILE WE FOUND HIM TO BE SOMEBODY THAT </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO KNOW BETTER, WE WERE CONCERNED THAT </p><p>HE SEEMED TO DWELL ON THE DISTANT PAST -- WEARING THE PRIDE </p><p>ON HIS SLEEVE OF HAVING BEEN ARRESTED MORE THAN 30 YEARS </p><p>AGO "UNDER THE FRENCH COLONIALISTS" AND DECRYING THE </p><p>OUTLAWING OF THE UBCV IN 1975.  HE DID NOT WISH TO BE DRAWN </p><p>INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT FUTURE ACTIVITIES, ASPIRATIONS, </p><p>GOALS, SO THE HISTORY LESSON WAS INTERESTING, BUT DID NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN CONGENOFFS RAISED THE </p><p>NAMES OF TWO BUDDHIST FOLLOWERS WHO HAVE VISITED THQ IN THE </p><p>PAST AND WHO ARE CURRENT CONGEN CONTACTS -- THICH NHAT </p><p>THIEN AND A NUN WHO DESCRIBES HERSELF AS THQ\'S GRANDNIECE - </p><p>- THQ\'S LANGUAGE INDICATED THAT HE HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT </p><p>THE FORMER.  THQ DESCRIBED THICH NHAT THIEN AS "SOMEBODY I </p><p>HAVE WORKED WITH IN THE PAST."  AS FOR HIS GRANDNIECE, HE </p><p>SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS, OR WHAT SHE WAS </p><p>DOING BECAUSE SHE WAS "USUALLY VERY BUSY." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) POST NOTES THAT ACCORDING TO A PRESS RELEASE </p><p>FROM THE "QUE ME" ACTION FOR DEMOCRACY IN VIETNAM/VIETNAM </p><p>COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, HEADQUARTERED IN FRANCE, A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02255  02 OF 02  170853Z </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION VISITING VIETNAM DURING </p><p>SEPTEMBER 7-11, WAS DENIED MEETINGS WITH THICH HUYEN QUANG, </p><p>THICH QUANG DO, AND FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY.  POST ALSO NOTES </p><p>THAT QUANG NGAI PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS DID NOT USE THE EXCUSE </p><p>OF TORRENTIAL RAINS AND FLOODED ROADS TO CANCEL OUR </p><p>APPOINTMENT, AS IS OFTEN DONE IN THESE SORTS OF SITUATIONS. </p><p>HOWEVER, PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS DID TRY TO KEEP THE MEETING </p><p>BRIEF.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, </p><p>NGUYEN KIM HIEU, PERHAPS DOWNPLAYING THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S </p><p>STATURE, HAD TOLD CONGENOFFS EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT THQ </p><p>WAS SIMPLY AN OLD MAN "WHOSE WAY OF THINKING DOES NOT AGREE </p><p>WITH OURS.  WE WOULD JUST LIKE HIM TO GO BACK TO HIS HOME </p><p>PROVINCE."  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
