<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001144 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM:  Have Money?  Get ESPN (and CNN)! </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Although the Vietnamese government (GVN) </p><p>regulates access to foreign television, particularly news </p><p>channels, enforcement of restrictions is limited and many </p><p>Vietnamese citizens have access to CNN and other foreign </p><p>channels.  High-level CPV and GVN officials, as well as </p><p>foreigners are permitted satellite receivers.  Cable TV </p><p>service including a number of foreign channels has been </p><p>available to the public in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hai </p><p>Phong since June 2002, while another, more limited, service </p><p>has been available from 1995.  By regulation, access to CNN </p><p>and some other foreign channels, is limited to senior </p><p>officials, press offices, think tank staff and foreigners, </p><p>but in practice, cable service providers are quite flexible </p><p>because they are trying to compete with the nearly </p><p>uncontrollable illegal use of satellite receivers.  GVN </p><p>officials admit lax enforcement of foreign TV access </p><p>restrictions and the GVN appears to tacitly recognize that, </p><p>as far as foreign television broadcasts go, the genie is out </p><p>of the bottle.  That said, the high cost of access and the </p><p>language barrier mean that very few Vietnamese actually </p><p>watch CNN or other foreign news.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Official Line and Regulations </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to Dao Duy Quat, Vice Chairman of the CPV\'s </p><p>Commission for Ideological and Cultural Affairs, the CPV\'s </p><p>position is that all foreign news items must be edited </p><p>before viewing, even by the selected group of GVN and CPV </p><p>officials permitted to see foreign broadcasts.  He </p><p>acknowledged no discrepancy between this policy and reality. </p><p>According to a June 18, 2002 Prime Ministerial decision </p><p>governing the installation and use of satellite receivers, a </p><p>select group of CPV and GVN officials may have satellite </p><p>receivers installed in their homes and offices for direct </p><p>access to foreign channels.  This group includes officials </p><p>at and above the vice minister or vice chairman rank, top </p><p>provincial-level officials and certain national security </p><p>related officials.  Also, daily newspapers, major television </p><p>and radio stations, the state news agency, foreign relations </p><p>journals based in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and foreigners </p><p>may have direct satellite access to foreign channels. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to the June 2002 decision, only designated </p><p>State companies may purchase and install Television Receiver </p><p>Only (TVRO) equipment and provide cable, or "pay" TV </p><p>service.  The decision restricts access to foreign channels </p><p>through pay TV to the group permitted satellite dishes, </p><p>provincial-level press offices, and think tank staff with a </p><p>demonstrated "need to study" what might be on foreign </p><p>channels.  Current regulations require that programs on </p><p>"Western" channels, excluding music and sports channels, </p><p>need to be "edited"; however, in reality, pay service </p><p>providers do not do any editing, claimed a Vietnam Central </p><p>Television (VCTV) official. </p><p> </p><p>Censorship? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  There is some censorship of foreign programming.  VCTV </p><p>also rebroadcasts some CNN programming as part of its </p><p>regular, non-fee service.  However, from our experience, </p><p>VCTV does edit sensitive portions of their CNN rebroadcast, </p><p>which is voiced over in Vietnamese so that the original </p><p>English is mostly unintelligible.  Service interruptions or </p><p>signal interference on these channels are not uncommon, but </p><p>it is unclear how many of these events are due to censorship </p><p>and how many are due to technical problems.  The only </p><p>censorship the GVN has acknowledged recently was of Star </p><p>World\'s broadcast of "Apocalypse Now Redux," although this </p><p>did not affect satellite service.  The rationale for this </p><p>decision is difficult to explain because other movies </p><p>depicting the Vietnam War such as "Missing in Action" and </p><p>"Platoon Leader" are not censored. </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Pay TV Services </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Senior officials from VCTV\'s Cable TV Service confirmed </p><p>to Emboff that pay TV service, via cable, began in June </p><p>2002, after the Prime Minister\'s decree.  One VCTV official </p><p>noted that for several months after the decree took effect, </p><p>service providers strictly followed access rules.  However </p><p>providers have become more and more flexible, due to </p><p>business reasons, he claimed.  In order to subscribe, one </p><p>completes an application form including contact and </p><p>employment information.  Installation in Hanoi costs VND </p><p>638,000 (roughly $42.50), while a monthly fee of VND 30,000 </p><p>(less than $2) is charged for access to five local channels </p><p>and nine other foreign channels, excluding CNN and BBC.  For </p><p>access to those copyrighted channels, subscribers pay VND </p><p>1,700,000 (some $113) for a decoder, and additional monthly </p><p>fee of VND 30,000 (less than $2).  Monthly service charges </p><p>in Ho Chi Minh City are much higher, running at around VND </p><p>350,000 (about $23).  Basic Installation in Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>is also more expensive, VND 750,000 (about $50). </p><p> </p><p>6.  A cable TV service director admitted that illegally </p><p>imported satellite receivers have been available in the </p><p>market for several years now.  Using this equipment, </p><p>subscribers to a Thai satellite television service receive </p><p>access to forty foreign channels at a cost of $300 annually. </p><p>The equipment itself costs about $600, and "quite a number </p><p>of rich households" have chosen to have it installed, he </p><p>added.  Foreign television programming can be seen in </p><p>entertainment establishments throughout Vietnam, with sports </p><p>and music channels appearing to be by far the most popular. </p><p>Indeed the June 2002 decree coincided with an upsurge in the </p><p>sale of illegal satellite dishes and the World Cup.  Small </p><p>satellite dishes can be found even in remote areas.  A GVN </p><p>campaign to confiscate and prohibit the sale of illegal </p><p>satellite dishes in August 2002 quickly fizzled; because, </p><p>according to some commentators, it was an impossible task. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Also according to a pay television service official, the </p><p>Multi-point Multi-channel Distribution System (MMDS) TV </p><p>service has been available in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>since 1995, first as part of a technical experimental </p><p>project.  During the 1995-1998 period, with imported Chinese </p><p>antennas costing about $80 each, one could receive a number </p><p>of foreign channels rebroadcast by VCTV including CNN, TV5, </p><p>MTV, and Cartoon Network.  In 1998, it was officially </p><p>launched as a pay service requiring a decoder box.  It is </p><p>subject to restrictions similar to those on cable service, </p><p>but has not caught on commercially.  MMDS is also available </p><p>in the southern provinces of Binh Duong, Dong Nai, Long An, </p><p>and Vung Tau.  Installation costs VND 1,700,000 ($113) and </p><p>monthly fees for packages of foreign range from VND 45,000 </p><p>to VND 500,000 ($3 to $33). </p><p> </p><p>8.  While Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City residents may subscribe </p><p>to the heavily advertised cable TV service, Hanoi has a </p><p>cheaper alternative, at least for the time being.  Hanoi </p><p>Television Service is now quietly selling and installing so- </p><p>called "set-top-boxes" for those who could afford to pay VND </p><p>3,000,000 (less than $200).  A set-top-box, or a "digital </p><p>head", as Hanoians are calling it, allows access to ten </p><p>foreign channels, including CNN, without any additional </p><p>charges.  There are currently no service charges because the </p><p>service is still in an experimental phase run by a VCTV </p><p>subsidiary.  Officials from VCTV Cable Television Service </p><p>asserted that buyers of those expensive "digital heads" are </p><p>being cheated. "Hanoi Television is just trying to sell as </p><p>many set-top-boxes as possible, despite their awareness that </p><p>the experimental project could be over by they end of the </p><p>year (2003), and fees will be charged from then on," </p><p>asserted a VCTV Cable Service director. </p><p> </p><p>Who Sees Foreign TV? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to experts from VCTV Cable Television Service, </p><p>most of their customers are Vietnamese workers at foreign </p><p>Embassies, international missions and foreign businesses, as </p><p>well as various GVN employees.  One television official </p><p>claimed that "Most people would find those news items (on </p><p>CNN) quite boring, except for employees of foreign </p><p>organizations that know English."  Other TV officials </p><p>suggested that many people in Hanoi who do not meet the </p><p>requirements set by the June 2002 decree receive cable and </p><p>MMDS TV service.  According to one source, there are about </p><p>25,000 cable subscribers in and around Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p> </p><p>10.  VCTV\'s Cable Television Service Director in Hanoi </p><p>explained the gap between regulations and reality on access </p><p>to foreign television channels as follows: "There are always </p><p>certain laws to govern certain things.  We have traffic laws </p><p>in place, but people are still violating them.  We need to </p><p>be flexible for business reasons."  Ministry of Culture and </p><p>Information officials insisted that they follow and enforce </p><p>regulations on access and "editing" (or censorship), but </p><p>admitted that there are many people with satellite dishes </p><p>who should not have them.  They refused to state whether </p><p>enforcing the regulations was not feasible or simply not a </p><p>priority. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The lax enforcement of television access restrictions </p><p>by GVN regulators appears to signal that they realize there </p><p>is little they can do to block the use of satellite dishes. </p><p>Likewise, the "flexible" approach of (GVN controlled) cable </p><p>service providers is a sign that they are attempting to </p><p>compete with illegal satellite receivers.  Especially in </p><p>Hanoi, short-lived attempts to enforce regulations have had </p><p>little effect and it seems the GVN has accepted that there </p><p>is little it can do to directly control access to foreign </p><p>television.  However, the cost of both pay and satellite TV </p><p>service is well beyond the means of the vast majority of </p><p>Vietnam\'s citizens.  Moreover, relatively few Vietnamese </p><p>find CNN or BBC interesting or even comprehensible. </p><p>Entertainment, especially sports, is king of foreign TV </p><p>programming in Vietnam.  Also, although hardly scientific, </p><p>Mission\'s impression is that it is much easier for </p><p>Vietnamese citizen to obtain access to foreign TV news </p><p>channels in Hanoi than in Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
