<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002113 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF AND INR </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SL, IV, SU, ZI, LY, CG, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED DISCUSSES AFRICA ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1587 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     B. PERRY-BOOTH 8/17 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolMilOff, called on </p><p>NSA Aliyu Mohammed on August 22.  LTC Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor also attended.  In addition to security </p><p>assistance, UNAMSIL troop rotations, the WCAR and </p><p>counter-narcotics (septels), the Ambassador and NSA discussed </p><p>Nigeria\'s perspectives on a number of African conflicts, </p><p>including Sudan, the DROC, Sierra Leone, and Liberia\'s impact </p><p>on Cote d\'Ivoire, offering a virtual tour d\'horizon on </p><p>conflict situations around the Continent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUDAN: The NSA emphasized that President Obasanjo had </p><p>received a number of Sudanese representatives in the past </p><p>months, including al-Mahdi, Garang, General Joseph Lagu, Bona </p><p>Malwal and others.  Francis Deng was expected soon from </p><p>Washington.  Malwal had informed the President that the </p><p>Southern Sudanese Civic Forum had decided to organize a </p><p>conference to discuss Sudan and form a common position among </p><p>the southern groups.  Nigeria had agreed to host the </p><p>conference of Southern Sudanese leaders in October (if the </p><p>various groups would agree to attend), which would ideally </p><p>lead them to unite in support of a "One Sudan" policy.  The </p><p>NSA described a possible outcome of a "One Sudan" policy as </p><p>"southern autonomy in some things -- a federation -- like </p><p>Nigeria." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Later, Joseph Lagu had suggested that both Southern </p><p>and Northern conferences were needed, to discuss terms for </p><p>progress, and President Obasanjo had agreed to work with </p><p>Egypt and Libya to arrange a conference of Northern Sudanese </p><p>leaders.  The NSA described the IGAD process as "dead," but </p><p>said Turabi had suggested a September meeting in Tripoli as </p><p>an opportunity to bring about a cease-fire and negotiations, </p><p>and build support for the Nigerian process.  The meeting in </p><p>Tripoli would include Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Libya and </p><p>Egypt.  Mohammed stated that President Obasanjo would go to </p><p>the meeting in Libya directly after his participation in the </p><p>WCAR in Durban.  Meanwhile, Nigeria planned to send its </p><p>envoy, Dr. Usman Bugaje (Vice President Atiku Abubakar\'s </p><p>Special Advisor on Political Affairs) to Sudan on August 24 </p><p>to begin discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DROC: The NSA stated that Nigeria had been developing </p><p>a plan for the DROC that would include a Presidential Council </p><p>with a rotating chairmanship of three to five people to rule </p><p>the country for an initial period of up to five years.  In </p><p>addition, an Executive Secretary to the Council would be </p><p>appointed, ideally from an Anglophone African country. </p><p>Ultimately, within five years, democratic elections would be </p><p>held on the ward, local, regional and national levels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mohammed said the current leadership in DROC had not </p><p>been informed about the plan; he dismissed Kabila as </p><p>"illegitimate" and in power without a democratic mandate. </p><p>The NSA alluded to questions about Kabila\'s nationality </p><p>(stories that Kabila is possibly a Tutsi from Rwanda), and </p><p>emphasized that Kabila is only in power because of support </p><p>from neighboring states, particularly Zimbabwe.  Moreover, </p><p>Kabila only controlled 40 percent of the country.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter asked about the role of Botswana in the DROC.  The NSA </p><p>dismissed the relevance of Botswana, saying that Masire had </p><p>not done a good job.  (The NSA was aware, however, of the </p><p>gathering of Congolese parties in Botswana to begin </p><p>preparations for the National Conference.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mohammed said the plan Nigeria is putting forward </p><p>would require 30,000 African peacekeeping troops, and a good </p><p>amount of money from the U.S., UN and EU.  He emphasized </p><p>that, in the 1960s, there had been 24,000 troops and 2000 </p><p>civilian personnel in the DROC.  A similar solution was </p><p>needed now.  When Ambassador Jeter noted that the cost of </p><p>such an operation would be "colossal," Mohammed agreed, but </p><p>said it was worth the cost because of the DROC\'s strategic </p><p>location, wealth in resources, and the impact of Congo\'s </p><p>instability on neighboring states.  When asked if Nigeria had </p><p>discussed the plan with other African states, the NSA felt </p><p>sure that the plan had only been discussed with the U.S. so </p><p>far, but Obasanjo planned soon to raise it with the EU.  If </p><p>the U.S. and EU agreed with the plan and would support it </p><p>financially, African countries would fall into line. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SIERRA LEONE: Mohammed gave a positive read-out on </p><p>Sierra Leone.  He noted that President Kabbah recently had </p><p>been to Abuja for a meeting with President Obasanjo, that </p><p>peace was returning and disarmament was progressing. </p><p>Mohammed offered the continuing RUF disarmament as an example </p><p>of a major step forward.  President Obasanjo would travel to </p><p>Sierra Leone on September 3 to meet with Kabbah.  He would </p><p>then travel with Kabbah to meet with RUF leader Issa Sessay </p><p>in Kono, and there call on the RUF to disarm.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter asked if the GON had contact with Omre Golley. </p><p>Mohammed said discussion with Golley may have taken place, </p><p>but "not with me." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) LIBERIA/COTE D\'IVOIRE: The NSA noted that Charles </p><p>Taylor was "tired now" and seemed to want peace.  The NSA </p><p>said that Nigeria\'s greatest present concern was Taylor\'s </p><p>meddling in Cote d\'Ivoire.  Ambassador Jeter, noting that </p><p>Taylor was a manipulator, asked Mohammed how Nigeria planned </p><p>to blunt Taylor\'s effort with General Guei, emphasizing that </p><p>Taylor would listen to Nigeria.  Mohammed stated that the GON </p><p>had been in contact with President Gbagbo on this issue, and </p><p>had asked Gbagbo to mention these concerns to the French, who </p><p>have "sympathy" for Taylor.  The NSA also expected that </p><p>Konare would "discuss it for Taylor\'s ears," implying an </p><p>indirect warning from the ECOWAS Chairman.  He said that the </p><p>GON had not yet approached Taylor directly, but assured us </p><p>that Obasanjo would do so.  He concluded, "We know Charles </p><p>Taylor well enough not to trust him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ZIMBABWE: Ambassador Jeter asked the NSA where Nigeria </p><p>stood on Zimbabwe, now that the Commonwealth meeting in Abuja </p><p>had been postponed.  The NSA said he had assured Dr. Rice at </p><p>the NSC that Nigeria would not let Qadhafi, who had met with </p><p>Mugabe after the OAU Summit in Lusaka, damage chances for </p><p>stability in Zimbabwe.  Obasanjo had promised to talk to </p><p>Qadhafi to warn him against meddling in that country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: President Obasanjo continues to engage </p><p>across Africa on a number of conflicts, often at the expense </p><p>of pressing issues at home.  Thus far, he appears to be </p><p>bringing his considerable weight to bear to bring parties </p><p>closer together, to negotiate their differences rather than </p><p>continue their resort to force of arms.  We continue to be </p><p>impressed by Nigeria\'s activism on the Continent and its </p><p>attempts to try to bring closure to conflict situations in </p><p>the sub-region.  However, as Nigeria\'s "solution" on the DROC </p><p>demonstrates, some of its plans and proposals are often </p><p>expensive propositions for non-regional players.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
