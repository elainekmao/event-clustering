<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 010894 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR S/CT FOR REAP, AND SA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 286744 </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS </p><p>IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP IN 1994 ARRESTED SEVERAL DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF BOMBINGS </p><p>OR OTHER INTERNAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  WHILE THE GOP OFTEN </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WAS </p><p>BEHIND THE ATTACKS AND SOMETIMES LABELS THEM AS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, THE GOP HAS NOT YET PROVIDED COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LINKS.  WE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THESE INCIDENTS </p><p>WERE CARRIED OUT BY PAKISTANI SECTARIAN ORGANIZATIONS OR </p><p>CRIMINAL ELEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>EGYPT IN 1994.  THE TREATY WAS DIRECTED AT EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC </p><p>MILITANTS LIVING IN THE TRIBAL AREAS OF PAKISTAN AND IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE WANTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES IN EGYPT.  THE </p><p>TREATY HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO FORCE, AND THEREFORE THE GOP </p><p>HAS NOT YET CARRIED OUT ANY EXTRADITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION/EXTRADITION. </p><p> </p><p>THE "TRIBAL AREAS" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT </p><p>UNDER THE COMPLETE LEGAL OR PRACTICAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOP.  IT </p><p>IS DIFFICULT FOR GOP AUTHORITIES TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, PROVINCIAL POLICE HAVE THE PRIMARY </p><p>AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  MANY OF THESE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT VIGOROUS </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE </p><p>ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  D.  OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP HAS COOPERATED FULLY IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING AND IN TRYING TO APPREHEND ONE </p><p>OF THE SUSPECTED PARTICIPANTS IN THE BOMBING, RAMZI AHMED </p><p>YOUSEF, WHO IS THOUGHT TO BE IN PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1994 </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP, ACTING ON THE REQUEST OF SEVERAL ARAB GOVERNMENTS, </p><p>DURING 1994 REFUSED TO EXTEND THE VISAS OF MANY ARABS WHO HAD </p><p>FOUGHT IN THE AFGHAN WAR AND WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE TRIBAL </p><p>AREAS AND PAKISTAN\'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.  MANY OF </p><p>THESE ARABS ARE SUSPECTED OF LINKS TO TERRORIST OR OTHER </p><p>QUESTIONABLE ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.  THE GOP </p><p>ALSO CLOSED DOWN SEVERAL ARAB NGO\'S IT BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>USED AS COVER ORGANIZATIONS FOR ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND </p><p>MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU </p><p>AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES </p><p>DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS </p><p>FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND PROVIDES NO </p><p>TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  THE GOP </p><p>ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1994 IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTS, OR COUNTRIES </p><p>SPONSORING TERRORISM.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PM </p><p>BHUTTO, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOP CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPINGS IN JUNE AND OCTOBER 1994 OF </p><p>FOREIGN TOURISTS BY REPUTED KASHMIRI MILITANTS IN INDIAN-HELD </p><p>KASHMIR AND IN NEW DELHI. </p><p> </p><p>9.  H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE NOTED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOP\'S COOPERATION </p><p>AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM DURING 1994. </p><p> </p><p>END OF ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>MONJO </p><p></p></div>
