XANANA WON 83 </p><p>PERCENT OF ALL VALID VOTES CAST.  XANANA, WHILE </p><p>MINDFUL OF THE PRESIDENT\'S CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>LIMITATIONS, INTENDS TO PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN </p><p>MOBILIZING CITIZENS TO IDENTIFY NATIONAL PRIORITIES </p><p>AND RECOMMEND SOLUTIONS.  AS HE TRIES TO LEAD, HE </p><p>MUST MOVE CAREFULLY TO AVOID GIVING THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT HE IS TRYING TO USURP POWERS, WHICH LEGITIMATELY </p><p>BELONG TO THE PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  XANANA </p><p>INDICATED HE WOULD TRY TO TEMPER PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LANDSLIDE VICTORY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO XANANA GUSMAO HAS WON </p><p>A RESOUNDING VICTORY TO BECOME THE FIRST-EVER, </p><p>ELECTED PRESIDENT OF EAST TIMOR.  XANANA WON 83 </p><p>PERCENT OF ALL VALID VOTES TO BEST HIS ONLY OPPONENT, </p><p>FRANCISCO XAVIER DO AMARAL.  EIGHTY-SIX PERCENT OF </p><p>ELIGIBLE VOTERS CAST BALLOTS.  XANANA SHOWED BROAD </p><p>APPEAL.  HE WON EVERY DISTRICT EXCEPT FOR XAVIER\'S </p><p>HOME REGION.  STILL, CONSIDERING XAVIER\'S LIMITED </p><p>RESOURCES AND HIS ILLNESS DURING THE FIRST PART OF </p><p>THE CAMPAIGN, HE MADE A RESPECTABLE SHOWING AGAINST </p><p>THE POPULAR, CHARISMATIC GUSMAO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  XANANA SERVED NOTICE IN HIS VICTORY STATEMENT </p><p>THAT HE WOULD WORK TOWARD HIS GOALS OF AN OPEN </p><p>PRESIDENCY, RECONCILIATION, JOB GROWTH AND FRIENDSHIP </p><p>WITH BIG NEIGHBORS (AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA).  HE </p><p>WILL WORK TO DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAMS TOWARD </p><p>PEOPLES\' MOST BASIC NEEDS, AND AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>EXPLAIN GOVERNMENT\'S LIMITATIONS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>FACE OF THEIR "HUGE EXPECTATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>CAUTIOUS ON RELATIONS WITH FRETILIN </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  XANANA WAS CAUTIOUS IN ANSWERING REPORTERS\' </p><p>QUERIES ABOUT FRICTION BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAJORITY </p><p>FRETILIN PARTY, WHICH WILL DOMINATE THE CABINET AND </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED DIFFERENCES WITH </p><p>FRETILIN, BUT TRIED TO DOWNPLAY CONFLICT, UNDERLINING </p><p>THAT EVEN IN THE INDEPENDENCE FIGHT, THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  XANANA WILL CONSULT AND MOBILIZE THE PEOPLE AND </p><p>"CIVIL SOCIETY" IN ORDER TO DETERMINE NATIONAL </p><p>PRIORITIES.  XANANA WAS CAREFUL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE </p><p>LIMITED ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, </p><p>BUT NOTED THAT HE WOULD WORK TO HELP THE CABINET </p><p>("THE GOVERNMENT") IMPLEMENT ITS PROGRAMS.  IN AREAS </p><p>WHERE THE GOVERNMENT FELL SHORT OF SOLVING PROBLEMS, </p><p>HE WOULD TRY TO GUIDE THE GOVERNMENT TOWARD </p><p>SOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  XANANA\'S VICTORY POSES A CHALLENGE TO THE </p><p>MAJORITY FRETILIN PARTY AND ITS LEADER, MARI </p><p>ALKATIRI.  XANANA\'S 83 PERCENT TOPS THE 62 PERCENT </p><p>POLLED BY FRETILIN IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.  IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT DROVES OF RANK-AND-FILE FRETILIN VOTERS </p><p>ALSO CAST BALLOTS FOR XANANA.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, </p><p>ALKATIRI PUBLICLY CONGRATULATED XANANA\'S VICTORY, BUT </p><p>HE DECLINED TO SAY HE WOULD FORM OR BE PART OF A </p><p>"GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY."  HE REMINDED </p><p>REPORTERS THAT THE CONSTITUTION EMPOWERS THE MAJORITY </p><p>PARTY IN THE ASSEMBLY TO NAME THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO </p><p>THEN APPOINTS MEMBERS TO THE CABINET.  HOWEVER, IN A </p><p>LATER APPEARANCE IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, </p><p>ALKATIRI PLEDGED THAT "PARLIAMENT, CABINET AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT" WOULD WORK TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  XANANA\'S VICTORY STATEMENT SHOWS HE HAS EVERY </p><p>INTENTION OF PLAYING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN EAST TIMOR, </p><p>WHILE RECOGNIZING THE LIMITS THAT THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>PLACES ON PRESIDENTIAL POWER.  AS HE TRIES TO LEAD, </p><p>HE MUST MOVE CAREFULLY TO AVOID GIVING THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT HE IS TRYING TO USURP POWERS, WHICH LEGITIMATELY </p><p>BELONG TO THE PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, XANANA, MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIMORESE, CAN DO </p><p>THE MOST TO TEMPER THE PUBLIC\'S EXPECTATIONS OF A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS SCARCE RESOURCES TO MEET A </p><p>SERIES OF PRESSING NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>BOYCE </p><p></p></div>
