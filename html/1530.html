(C) SUMMARY: THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 15 THE START OF PHASE II OF THE </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, AIMED AT </p><p>RESETTLING A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION AS COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS.  WHILE THIS PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE BASED ON A </p><p>PREVIOUS MODEL DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH DONORS, </p><p>MODEL A2, THE GOZ HAS NOT STATED THIS PUBLICLY AND FEW </p><p>SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE NEW PHASE II PROGRAM HAVE BEEN </p><p>MADE PUBLIC.  MEANWHILE, PHASE I OF THE "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, AIMED AT RELOCATING PEASANTS </p><p>FROM THE RURAL COMMUNAL LANDS ONTO COMMERCIAL FARMS, HAS </p><p>BEEN ANYTHING BUT SUCCESSFUL.  VIOLENT ASSAULTS BY "WAR </p><p>VETS" CONTINUE AGAINST FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S OCCUPIED FARMS ON A WEEKLY BASIS.  THE GOZ </p><p>HAS STEPPED UP ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY OVER ITS RULINGS </p><p>AGAINST THE "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM AND FARM OCCUPATIONS. </p><p>MANY COMMERCIAL FARMERS WE HAVE TALKED TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S GOAL IS NOT TO DESTROY COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMING, BUT TO INTIMIDATE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS SO </p><p>THAT THOSE WHO REMAIN IN ZIMBABWE WILL NEVER AGAIN </p><p>BECOME INVOLVED IN POLITICS.  AS A RESULT OF THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS, THE "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM\'S SHORTFALLS, THE </p><p>ECONOMIC CRISIS, AND POOR RAINFALL IN SOME REGIONS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00765  01 OF 03  161059Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE GOZ WILL NEED TO IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES </p><p>OF WHEAT, AND POSSIBLY MAIZE, BY THE END OF 2001, AT A </p><p>TIME WHEN IT WILL HAVE LITTLE HARD CURRENCY TO PAY FOR </p><p>THEM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PHASE 2 - "IF AT FIRST YOU DON\'T SUCCEED..." </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JANUARY 15 THE GOZ ANNOUNCED THROUGH A FULL- </p><p>PAGE AD IN THE GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" THE BEGINNING </p><p>OF PHASE II OF "FAST-TRACK," WITH A STATED GOAL OF </p><p>DEVELOPING A NEW GENERATION OF INDIGENOUS SMALL-, </p><p>MEDIUM-, AND LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  PHASE II </p><p>APPEARS TO BE BASED ON A PLAN TO DEVELOP INDIGENOUS </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY THE GOZ IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH DONORS IN 1998 AND CALLED MODEL A2. </p><p>UNDER PHASE II, THE FARM SIZES WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE </p><p>TYPE OF FARMING TO BE PURSUED, AND THE AREA\'S RAINFALL </p><p>CLASSIFICATION.  PHASE II IS AIMED AT ZIMBABWEANS WHO </p><p>HAVE A PROCLIVITY FOR COMMERCIAL FARMING AND HAVE ASSETS </p><p>THAT THEY CAN DEVOTE TO THIS ENDEAVOR.  THE GOAL OF </p><p>PHASE I WAS TO GIVE SMALL PLOTS OF LAND TO CURRENT </p><p>COMMUNAL LAND SUBSISTENCE FARMERS.  THE GOZ HAS ALREADY </p><p>DECLARED PHASE II TO BE A ROARING SUCCESS BASED ON THE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF ZIMBABWEANS WHO HAVE BESIEGED THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF LAND FOR THEIR FREE APPLICATIONS.  YET, TO OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, THE GOZ HAS NOT MADE PUBLIC ANY DETAILS AS TO </p><p>THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT WILL BE USED TO AWARD LAND TO </p><p>BENEFICIARIES UNDER PHASE II, OR ANY OTHER SPECIFICS ON </p><p>HOW PHASE II WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.  IN ADDITION, THE GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00765  01 OF 03  161059Z </p><p>HAS FEW RESOURCES TO HANDLE EVEN THE MOST RUDIMENTARY </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS OF PHASE II, LET ALONE TO PROVIDE </p><p>OTHER SUPPORT, INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED FINANCING, THAT THE </p><p>FUTURE INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMERS WILL NEED UNDER THE </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PHASE I OF "FAST-TRACK" A RESOUNDING FAILURE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PHASE I OF THE "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, </p><p>WHICH HAS PRINCIPALLY ENTAILED THE ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS BY "WAR VETS" AND RURAL PEASANTS, IS, </p><p>BY MOST ACCOUNTS A FAILURE.  THE GOZ MINISTER OF LANDS, </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND RURAL RESETTLEMENT, JOSEPH MADE, HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY STATED THAT 2597 FARMS TOTALING 5.9 MILLION </p><p>HECTARES HAVE BEEN GAZETTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION. </p><p>MOREOVER, HE HAS CLAIMED THAT 86,000 FAMILIES HAVE </p><p>ALREADY BEEN RESETTLED ON THREE MILLION HECTARES OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMLAND.  THESE ARE WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>EXTREMELY INFLATED FIGURES.  THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC) OPPOSITION STATES THAT AT MOST 5,000 </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE BEEN RESETTLED TO DATE.  MINISTER MADE HAS </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THE GOZ HAS ONLY PROVIDED TILLAGE SERVICE </p><p>ON 4,666 HECTARES OF LAND ACQUIRED UNDER "FAST-TRACK". </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3028 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00765  02 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C69483  161100Z /38 </p><p>R 161100Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8241 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000765 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE CURRENT STATE AND PROJECTED CONSEQUENCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00765  02 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>OF THE "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>THE GOZ MINISTER OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI, TOLD AN EMBASSY FSN INFORMALLY THAT ONLY </p><p>2,000 HECTARES OUT OF 200,000 ACQUIRED UNDER "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" HAVE BEEN UTILIZED THIS AGRICULTURAL SEASON. </p><p>MINISTER OF RURAL RESOURCES AND WATER DEVELOPMENT, JOYCE </p><p>MUJURU, STATED IN THE JANUARY 20 GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE </p><p>HERALD" NEWSPAPER THAT THE "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM HAS </p><p>SUFFERED FROM A POOR TURNOUT OF BENEFICIARIES.  THE CFU </p><p>AND INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAVE TOLD US THAT MANY </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE "RESETTLED" UNDER PHASE I HAVE LEFT THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS AND GONE BACK TO THE COMMUNAL LANDS </p><p>AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THEY WERE GETTING NO </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOZ.  THE MINISTER OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING, IGNATIUS </p><p>CHOMBO, HAS CONFIRMED THIS FACT BY STATING THAT MANY OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN "RESETTLED" HAVE RENEGED ON </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENT TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND THEY HAVE </p><p>BEEN GIVEN AND HAVE GONE BACK TO THEIR HOMES.  THE </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE GENERAL AGRICULTURE AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PLANTATION WORKERS UNION OF ZIMBABWE (GAPWUZ), PHILIP </p><p>MUNYANYI, CLAIMS THAT ONLY 318 FORMER FARM WORKERS\' </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE BEEN RESETTLED UNDER PHASE I, OUT OF A </p><p>FARM LABOR FORCE OF 500,000. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE CONTINUES ON THE FARMS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY, THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00765  02 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 1100 </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS REMAIN OCCUPIED.  THE LEVEL OF </p><p>OCCUPATION VARIES, WITH SOME FARMS HAVING ONLY A HANDFUL </p><p>OF "WAR VETS", WHILE OTHERS HOST A HUNDRED OR MORE </p><p>SQUATTERS.  EACH WEEK THERE ARE NEW REPORTS OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS BEING THREATENED OR ASSAULTED, AND OF </p><p>THEIR FARM WORKERS BEING BEATEN AND EVICTED FROM THEIR </p><p>HOUSING.  A NEW TACTIC BEING USED BY "WAR VETS" TO </p><p>HARASS FARMERS AND EXTRACT A CASH FLOW IS TO DRIVE A </p><p>FARMER\'S CATTLE INTO AN AREA WHERE SQUATTERS HAVE </p><p>PLANTED MAIZE, AND THEN DEMAND EXORBITANT MONETARY </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE MAIZE BY THE </p><p>CATTLE.  THE CFU REPORTS THAT POLICE GENERALLY RESPOND </p><p>TO THE MORE SERIOUS CONFRONTATIONS AND VIOLENCE, BUT DO </p><p>NOTHING TO ARREST THE PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE OR PURSUE </p><p>CRIMES SUCH AS THE THEFT OF FARM PROPERTY.  THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN NO PROGRESS BY THE POLICE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE </p><p>KILLINGS OF SIX WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND FIVE FARM </p><p>WORKERS SINCE LAST FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>BLAME THE FAILURE ON THE JUDICIARY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MEANWHILE, THE GOZ LABELS THE JUDICIARY AS THE </p><p>VILLAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING THE SUCCESS OF "FAST- </p><p>TRACK."  IT CONTINUES TO IGNORE THE DECEMBER SUPREME </p><p>COURT RULING DECLARING THE CURRENT "FAST-TRACK" EXERCISE </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER COURT RULINGS </p><p>AGAINST "FAST-TRACK."  FURTHERMORE, THE GOZ IS STILL </p><p>IGNORING COURT ORDERS FOR THE POLICE TO REMOVE ILLEGAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00765  02 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>OCCUPIERS AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW ON COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS.  THOUGH THE GOZ FORCED THE HEAD SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE TO RESIGN LAST WEEK (REF A), PROBLEMS EXIST AT </p><p>ALL LEVELS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  LAST WEEK THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURT DISMISSED THE GOZ\'S REQUEST FOR </p><p>CONFIRMATION ORDERS ON THE ACQUISITION OF TWO COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS UNTIL THE GOZ PRODUCES A WORKABLE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM.  THE CFU HAS TOLD US THAT AS OF THE BEGINNING </p><p>FEBRUARY, NO FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION BY THE GOZ SINCE "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>BEGAN IN JUNE 2000 HAVE YET BEEN LEGALLY ACQUIRED BY THE </p><p>GOZ.  THE CFU ALSO TOLD US THAT THE GOZ IS NOT MEETING </p><p>DEADLINES FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE VARIOUS LEGAL NOTICES </p><p>REQUIRED IN THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION PROCESS UNDER THE </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION ACT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS WHOLE EXERCISE? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

A VIEW HELD BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE CFU </p><p>EXECUTIVE BODY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>WE HAVE TALKED TO, IS THAT MUGABE\'S GOAL IS NOT TO DRIVE </p><p>ALL WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS FROM ZIMBABWE.  RATHER, IT </p><p>IS TO DRIVE AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF WHITE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS OUT OF ZIMBABWE, AND THEREBY OBTAIN THEIR LAND </p><p>FOR RESETTLEMENT WITHOUT PAYING ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE </p><p>LAND.  AT THE SAME TIME, MUGABE WANTS A CORE GROUP OF </p><p>WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, WHOSE OPERATIONS WILL BRING IN </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDED HARD CURRENCY, TO REMAIN IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>THE THINKING GOES THAT THIS REMAINING GROUP OF WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS WILL HAVE BEEN SO TRAUMATIZED BY THE </p><p>CURRENT "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, THAT THEY </p><p>WILL NEVER AGAIN SUPPORT AN OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A CONSEQUENCE IS FOOD INSECURITY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE OCCUPATIONS, THE ECONOMY, AND THE LACK OF </p><p>RAINFALL IN SOME AGRICULTURAL AREAS THIS SEASON HAVE ALL </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO A SCENARIO WHERE THE GOZ MAY WELL HAVE TO </p><p>IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES OF GRAIN AS EARLY AS AUGUST.  AS </p><p>A RESULT OF THE FARM OCCUPATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES </p><p>RELATED TO "FAST-TRACK", THE GOZ AGRITEX EARLY WARNING </p><p>UNIT REPORTED THAT THE TOTAL AREA UNDER CROPS IS DOWN BY </p><p>22 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR, INCLUDING A 22 PERCENT DROP </p><p>IN THE AREA PLANTED IN MAIZE.  THE CFU HAS TOLD US THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00765  03 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAVE PLANTED 48 PERCENT LESS MAIZE </p><p>(REFS B, C, AND D), AND THAT THE HECTARAGE PLANTED IN </p><p>WINTER WHEAT WILL ALSO BE REDUCED DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE FARM OCCUPATIONS.  A RECENT ANALYSIS BY THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANK OF ZIMBABWE ESTIMATES THAT THE GOZ WILL </p><p>NEED TO IMPORT BETWEEN 70,000 AND 130,000 METRIC TONS OF </p><p>WHEAT BY JULY.  AGRITEX HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT RAINFALL </p><p>HAS BEEN BELOW AVERAGE OVER MOST OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH </p><p>THE FIRST WEEK OF FEBRUARY, WITH THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY IN NEAR DROUGHT CONDITION.  BOTH AGRITEX AND </p><p>THE USAID FEWS/NET ZIMBABWE HAVE REPORTED THAT COMMUNAL </p><p>FARMERS IN CERTAIN SOUTHERN DISTRICTS HAVE WRITTEN OFF </p><p>THEIR MAIZE CROPS THIS SEASON DUE TO THE LACK OF </p><p>RAINFALL.  IN ADDITION, DUE TO PRICE HIKES, COMMUNAL </p><p>FARMERS NATIONWIDE ARE HARD PRESSED TO AFFORD THE MID- </p><p>SEASON FERTILIZER THEIR CROPS NEED.  THE JANUARY USAID </p><p>FEWS/NET ZIMBABWE MONTHLY FOOD SECURITY UPDATE ESTIMATES </p><p>THAT IF ZIMBABWE FAILS TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT RAINFALL IN </p><p>ITS BREADBASKET REGION DURING THE REMAINDER OF FEBRUARY, </p><p>A MAIZE PRODUCTION DEFICIT IS POSSIBLE THAT COULD </p><p>REQUIRE THE GOZ TO IMPORT BETWEEN 200,000 AND 400,000 </p><p>METRIC TONS OF MAIZE BY THE END OF 2001. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: IT IS BECOMING MORE CLEAR THAT AN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL DISASTER IS LOOMING IN ZIMBABWE.  WHILE </p><p>MUGABE MAY STILL REAP POLITICAL BENEFITS FROM THE "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE AMONG POOR AND LANDLESS </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, AND WITH PHASE II, CUT INTO THE MDC\'S CORE </p><p>URBAN SUPPORT, IT IS CLEAR THAT FROM AN ECONOMIC </p><p>PERSPECTIVE THE "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM HAS </p><p>SUCCEEDED ONLY AT DISRUPTING PRODUCTION ON THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00765  03 OF 03  161100Z </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS, WHILE PROVIDING NO VIABLE SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE NEEDS OF LANDLESS PEOPLE AND THOSE LIVING ON </p><p>MARGINAL LAND IN THE COMMUNAL AREAS.  BASED ON THE TRACK </p><p>RECORD OF PHASE I, WE DOUBT THAT PHASE II WILL BE ANY </p><p>MORE SUCCESSFUL AT ITS GOAL OF DEVELOPING "INSTANT" </p><p>INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  HAVING DRIVEN AWAY </p><p>NEARLY ALL FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND MOST FOREIGN TOURISTS, </p><p>THE GOZ DOES NOT AND PROBABLY WILL NOT HAVE THE HARD </p><p>CURRENCY NEEDED TO PAY FOR GRAIN IMPORTS LATER THIS </p><p>YEAR.  THE PROJECTED HARD CURRENCY EARNINGS FROM THE </p><p>SALE OF THE NATION\'S TOBACCO CROP BEGINNING IN APRIL </p><p>HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPENT OR ALLOCATED BY THE GOZ, LEAVING </p><p>LITTLE FOR GRAIN IMPORTS.  EVEN IF THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE </p><p>ABOUT-FACE ON THE GOZ\'S LAND AND ECONOMIC POLICIES, A </p><p>DEVELOPMENT WE DO NOT FORESEE, THE GOZ WILL VERY LIKELY </p><p>NEED EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO FEED ITS PEOPLE BY THE END </p><p>OF 2001.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
