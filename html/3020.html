<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (COX AND ROBERTSON), AF/S (KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JANDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "STANDARD" EDITOR SETS NEW ARREST RECORD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   BORNWELL CHAKAODZA, EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY </p><p>    "STANDARD" WAS ARRESTED AGAIN ON MAY 23, SETTING A NEW </p><p>    ZIMBABWEAN RECORD FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES AN EDITOR HAS </p><p>    BEEN ARRESTED IN ONE WEEK.  CHAKAODZA WAS ALSO ARRESTED ON </p><p>    MAY 22 AND MAY 16.  WHILE OTHER EDITORS MAY BOAST A HIGHER </p><p>    NUMBER OF LIFETIME ARRESTS (BY OUR RECKONING "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>    EDITOR GEOFF NYAROTA LEADS THAT RACE WITH 6 ARRESTS IN THE </p><p>    LAST TWO YEARS), NO ONE COMES CLOSE TO CHAKAODZA\'S RECORD- </p><p>    SETTING THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE MAY 23 ARREST OF CHAKAODZA AND ONE OF HIS </p><p>    REPORTERS, FARAI MUTSAKA, WAS FOR "PUBLISHING FALSEHOODS," </p><p>    A VIOLATION OF THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF </p><p>    PRIVACY ACT (AIPPA).  THE MAY 23 ARREST WAS SPARKED BY AN </p><p>    ARTICLE IN THE MAY 12 EDITION OF THE "STANDARD" THAT </p><p>    PREDICTED STAFFING CHANGES AT THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>    "ZIMPAPERS" PUBLISHING CONMPANY.  THE ARREST FOLLOWED THE </p><p>    NOW-FAMILIAR NORM: POLICE ARRIVE AT THE "STANDARD\'S" </p><p>    OFFICES, TAKE THE JOURNALISTS INTO CUSTODY AND DELIVER THEM </p><p>    TO POLICE CENTRAL HQ IN HARARE.  AT THE POLICE STATION, THE </p><p>    JOURNALISTS SPEND TWO OR THREE HOURS ANSWERING A POLICE </p><p>    INSPECTOR\'S QUESTIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT STORIES IN VARIOUS </p><p>    EDITIONS OF THE NEWSPAPER.  EVENTUALLY, THE POLICE CHARGE </p><p>    THE JOURNALISTS FOR A SPECIFIC STORY, COLLECT THE BAIL, AND </p><p>    LET THEM GO.  THUS FAR, THE JOURNALISTS HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>    MISTREATED. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE HARASSMENT OF THE "STANDARD" OVER THE LAST WEEK </p><p>    HAS BEEN EXPENSIVE IN TERMS OF TIME LOST IN THE NEWSROOM, </p><p>    LEGAL FEES AND BAIL.  THE ARRESTS, HOWEVER, SEEM TO HAVE </p><p>    STRENGTHENED THE RESOLVE OF CHAKAODZA, HIS REPORTERS AND </p><p>    THEIR PUBLISHER TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
