<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, KDEM, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: APRIL FOOLS - NLC SUSPENDS STRIKE OF </p><p>CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Lagos 673 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  Joseph Akinlaja, General Secretary of the </p><p>National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, </p><p>informed Laboff that the GON reached an agreement with </p><p>the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) at approximately 0100 </p><p>hours on April 1, 2003, hours before a nationwide civil </p><p>service strike was scheduled to begin.  A few pockets </p><p>of workers did not get word of the agreement and </p><p>carried out the strike this morning; word of the </p><p>agreement has since spread to most areas.  Despite </p><p>initial confusion, there have been no serious violence </p><p>or demonstrations.  Akinlaja said he is certain that </p><p>NLC leaders will suspend the strike when they meet </p><p>today in Abuja.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole will </p><p>hold a press conference to brief journalists on the </p><p>NLC\'s position after union leaders review the </p><p>agreement.  Details of the agreement will be available </p><p>by April 2, 2003.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Despite the NLC\'s late night agreement, the </p><p>national secretariat failed to send a clear signal in </p><p>time to all state chapters to call off the strike. </p><p>While most civil servants in Lagos and Abuja were </p><p>informed this morning that the agreement was reached, </p><p>small pockets of civil servants at the state level did </p><p>not receive the news and did not report for work.  In </p><p>Jos and Sokoto, where local radio stations announced </p><p>that the strike had been called off, most workers </p><p>reported for duty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Oshiomhole\'s statement on the Hausa Service of the </p><p>BBC this morning did not clarify matters in the North; </p><p>he told listeners of the NLC\'s discussions with the GON </p><p>but did not instruct workers to call off the strike. </p><p>In Abuja, most of the streets housing government </p><p>offices were empty this morning.  At the Federal </p><p>Secretariat and Supreme Court, some workers attempted </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to force their colleagues to comply with the strike </p><p>order.  Some of the workers who had reported to work </p><p>capitalized on the confusion as an excuse to return </p><p>home.  Several senior management officers remained at </p><p>work to comply with the GON\'s instruction that workers </p><p>from levels 7-17 are exempt from the strike.  At the </p><p>Abuja airport, most of the offices were initially </p><p>closed in the morning, but Aviation Minister Kema </p><p>Chikwe reportedly instructed senior management to </p><p>reopen the affected offices.  In Kano, the fuel </p><p>scarcity coupled with the strike caused most workers to </p><p>stay home.  Although some workers later reported, the </p><p>strike had already paralyzed activities in Kano City. </p><p>In Kaduna the strike was partially observed.  In the </p><p>early morning, labor leaders locked out workers who </p><p>reported for duty; by late morning, leaders allowed </p><p>some workers to occupy their offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Ambassador and Laboff are scheduled to meet </p><p>with Oshiomhole on Thursday, April 3 to discuss the </p><p>suspended strike, NLC efforts to resolve the 12.5 </p><p>percent wage increase dispute, and other labor issues </p><p>leading up to the elections.  COMMENT:  We expect that </p><p>tomorrow will return to normal, unless the purported </p><p>agreement implodes as the sides wrangle over details. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
