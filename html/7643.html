<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000746 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 22April2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KDEM, PREL, NI, US, EU, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OVERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Independent National Electoral </p><p>Commission has declared the ruling PDP the major victor in </p><p>the April 19 and April 12 elections.  However, echoing </p><p>reports of several observers, President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>political opponents allege massive irregularities.  The GON </p><p>is striking back with criticism of some observers and the </p><p>international media.  The battle over the legitimacy of the </p><p>elections is thus engaged.  As part of this post-elections </p><p>competition, Nigerians on both sides of the win/lose divide </p><p>will selectively quote the verdicts of international and </p><p>domestic observer missions, citing the passages supporting </p><p>their varying contentions.  Four major international </p><p>observer missions have published interim reports.  All cite </p><p>serious flaws in the elections, with the IRI submission </p><p>being the mildest and the EU the toughest of the bunch. </p><p>Two domestic groups (TMG and JDPC) were sharply critical on </p><p>some points but laudatory on others.  Many Nigerians await </p><p>our response.  We must proceed with great caution, since </p><p>what we say could tip the balance here toward acquiescence </p><p>or confrontation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary continued: While the elections transpired </p><p>peacefully, the political climate remains tense; violence </p><p>and unrest could still spring forth if care is not taken </p><p>and responsible leadership is not exercised.  Any USG </p><p>statement must be based on the understanding that </p><p>democratization is a process requiring stability and that </p><p>our interest in democratization extends beyond these two </p><p>election dates.  We do not want to unwittingly precipitate </p><p>instability that would undermine democracy, a very harsh </p><p>statement intended to defend democracy could have the </p><p>counter productive impact of undercutting democracy by </p><p>encouraging unrest.  Thus, we should recognize both the </p><p>positives and the negatives of the electoral process, </p><p>drawing attention to the many material flaws and troubling </p><p>irregularities that sullied the elections in many </p><p>jurisdictions while complimenting the Nigerian people for </p><p>their patience.  We should avoid a general conclusion </p><p>whether the elections were or were not credible.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WHAT IS AT STAKE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The key objectives of democratization and stability </p><p>are at stake in Nigeria.  The April 12 and 19 elections </p><p>were a historic moment for the country.  In the past, </p><p>civilian-run elections had been the parent of instability. </p><p>April\'s polls presented the chance to break the cycle of </p><p>failed elections and successful military coups that have </p><p>dogged Nigeria\'s civilian regimes.  Yet, no matter how much </p><p>we wanted the elections to go well, we also realized the </p><p>process would be more coarse than refined.  There would be </p><p>blemishes because politics in Nigeria remained a </p><p>tumultuous, often dirty, winner-take-all game, often </p><p>involving livelihoods and even great wealth.  We all hoped </p><p>that the conduct of this election would be a sufficient </p><p>break from the past to allow Nigeria to leap this hurdle </p><p>and begin to build a self-sustaining democracy.  The </p><p>elections of the past two weeks have not dashed that hope, </p><p>but they have made it more difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>VIEW FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some positive developments have emerged from this </p><p>series of elections.  First and foremost, the Nigerian </p><p>public did its job. Voters came out in respectable numbers; </p><p>they stood in line, sometimes waiting patiently for hours </p><p>for INEC to get its act together.  They voted peacefully </p><p>and went home orderly to await the results.  Registration </p><p>of more political parties opened the political space </p><p>reducing tension by letting more people and parties enter </p><p>the political arena.  Creation of the computerized voters </p><p>registers provide a base for an expected continuous </p><p>registration process that will serve the nation well in </p><p>2007 and future elections.  In many parts of the country, </p><p>INEC\'s logistical preparations on April 19 were a cut </p><p>better than its dismal April 12 performance.  Throughout, </p><p>the Nigerian judiciary did a good job.  There was never a </p><p>fear that the military would intervene in any way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, MISCONDUCT WAS NOT HARD TO FIND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, the elections also had an underbelly.  INEC </p><p>failed to sufficiently break with Nigeria\'s history and </p><p>business-as-usual in the areas that have traditionally been </p><p>the weakest links in Nigerian elections -- the vote </p><p>tabulation and collation processes. In many locations, </p><p>tabulation sheets were doctored to produce false returns. </p><p>In some areas, ballot boxes with valid ballots were removed </p><p>and replaced with fake votes.  In other places, polling </p><p>stations were moved to locations undisclosed to the general </p><p>public so that an incumbent\'s partisans could have free </p><p>rein at that location.  Some times, no polling stations </p><p>were opened at all but returns were reported from these </p><p>nonexistent stations.  Emboffs have repeatedly encountered </p><p>PDP supporters who lament that the rigging was so excessive </p><p>and obvious, it had tainted their electoral successes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Many of these infidelities were material to the </p><p>electoral outcome.  For both the April 12 and 19 elections </p><p>in Edo state, Mission and other observers saw vote counts </p><p>at numerous individual polling stations indicating </p><p>significant support for the ANPP.  However, the incumbent </p><p>PDP governor won handily in that state despite the fact </p><p>that he is widely unpopular.  The high voter turnouts and </p><p>margins of victory for Obasanjo and the incumbent PDP </p><p>governors reported by INEC in perhaps half the states </p><p>diverge significantly from the reports of our and other </p><p>observers.  Their observations suggested much more </p><p>competitive races involving lower voter turnouts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In many states in the South, the PDP achieved </p><p>grossly lopsided margins where the voting for the ANPP and </p><p>other opposition parties was so low that the outcome defied </p><p>reasonable explanation given our knowledge of the political </p><p>terrain of those areas.  For example, the Igbo-dominated </p><p>APGA made a very strong showing at the April 12 polls in </p><p>the Southeastern region; at least, APGA\'s gubernatorial </p><p>candidates should have provided very strong competition in </p><p>Anambra and Enugu.  However, out of 56 National Assembly </p><p>seats (House and Senate) in those five states, APGA gained </p><p>just one House seat (plus another in Bayelsa), but no </p><p>Senate seats or governorships.  Extrapolating from what we </p><p>saw of APGA\'s strength at various polling areas, the party </p><p>should have captured between 20-30 Assembly seats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In the North, manipulation was more subtle but </p><p>still widespread.  For example, turning a few votes in </p><p>selected wards resulted in a PDP sweep of the 12 Assembly </p><p>seats in Bauchi in spite of Emboff\'s observed support for </p><p>the ANPP in many districts.  Extrapolating from what we saw </p><p>of ANPP\'s strength at the polling areas we observed, ANPP </p><p>should have won one hundred or more of the northern </p><p>Assembly seats instead of the 79 that they obtained.  PDP </p><p>probably was not alone in its efforts to influence the </p><p>elections\' outcome.  Underage voting, while evident </p><p>throughout the nation, was common in the North.  The ANPP </p><p>likely took advantage of this practice to pad its already </p><p>large margin.  Other malevolent actions by the opposition </p><p>also no doubt took place; however, not on the scale of the </p><p>observed PDP controlled areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Notwithstanding frequent invocations of God, none of </p><p>Nigeria\'s political parties is staffed by angels or saints. </p><p>All parties took advantage of the process where they could. </p><p>However, the PDP was the dominant transgressor, simply </p><p>because it controlled more states and the important INEC </p><p>appointments in all jurisdictions.  In the South, the </p><p>general result of the misconduct was to skew voting in many </p><p>states to inflate probable PDP majorities or pluralities </p><p>into gross landslides.  In this sense, the experience of </p><p>the 1999 elections was repeated.  Some of the northern </p><p>states experienced a more subtle chicanery, different from </p><p>the military-administered 1999 elections.  In these states, </p><p>the aim might not have been to manufacture PDP victories. </p><p>Such victories in many northern jurisdictions would have </p><p>been outlandish.  Instead, the tallies were likely massaged </p><p>to assure Obasanjo gained 25 percent of the vote in as many </p><p>places as possible. (NOTE: To win the election, a candidate </p><p>needed at least a plurality as well as 25 per cent of the </p><p>vote in 25 jurisdictions (36 states plus the FCT).  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) We believe that INEC\'s results for the presidential </p><p>race are biased and skewed.  However, we cannot say with </p><p>exactitude what the real outcome was.  Obasanjo might have </p><p>actually won a first round victory, albeit by a decidedly </p><p>slimmer margin.  However, given our observations of both </p><p>the elections and the political scene over time, as well as </p><p>analysis of the INEC results and observer mission reports, </p><p>it is more likely that both Obasanjo and Buhari due to </p><p>impuissance in the North and South, respectively, failed to </p><p>clear the 25 per cent threshold in the requisite number of </p><p>states.  If so, a run-off election, not an Obasanjo first </p><p>round victory, should have been the accurate, just outcome </p><p>of April 19. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>AN OBSERVATION ABOUT THE OBSERVER MISSIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Because there were marked differences in numbers of </p><p>observers and the geographic coverage of the missions, </p><p>differences were expected in the statements made by the </p><p>international observer groups.  However, there is also a </p><p>common thread to all the statements thus far.  All the </p><p>interim reports state that the elections were very bad in </p><p>some states, needed sometimes significant improvement in </p><p>others, and were relatively good in a few.  Two domestic </p><p>observer groups (TMG and JDPC) were laudatory on some </p><p>points and sharply critical on others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) In many states of the South-South and Southeast, as </p><p>well as Katsina and Kaduna, the elections were tainted by </p><p>flaws so serious that results from these areas are presumed </p><p>to be grossly inaccurate.  Second, in some states, </p><p>especially in the Northeast and North Central zones, there </p><p>were significant irregularities that would call into </p><p>question the voting percentages if not the actual victory. </p><p>This is where the 25 percent threshold might be material. </p><p>Third, in the FCT, the states in the Southwest and most of </p><p>the Northwest, the process was relatively efficient and </p><p>transparent, although some complaints about vote tampering </p><p>in these areas have been made.  For example, in Lagos </p><p>State, the PDP credibly accuses the AD of not permitting </p><p>their agents to participate in the collation process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) In addition to the presidential poll, gubernatorial </p><p>elections took place in all jurisdictions except the FCT. </p><p>For many, the stakes involved in these contests were every </p><p>bit as high as those of the presidential race.  Some of the </p><p>regional variation in the quality of elections may have </p><p>arisen from the efforts of embattled (primarily PDP) </p><p>incumbent governors to assure their re-election by margins </p><p>large enough to cow the opposition, a by-product of which </p><p>were improbably large margins in the presidential race as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>WHAT SHOULD WE NOT SAY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The vast differences in the integrity of the </p><p>elections in the various states argue for a USG statement </p><p>that avoids a blanket conclusion about the credibility of </p><p>the elections.  A blanket statement could not do justice to </p><p>the complexities of this vast electoral undertaking and </p><p>could be susceptible to both purposeful and innocent </p><p>misinterpretation.  A statement acknowledging the material </p><p>differences in the conduct of the elections would be more </p><p>accurate and less prone to encourage action inimical to the </p><p>continued development, democracy, and domestic and regional </p><p>stability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION DOING? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) The opposition parties most important to the post- </p><p>election scenario are the ANPP, APGA and AD.  Each has its </p><p>own axe to grind. The ANPP claims that its presidential </p><p>candidate has been shafted by manipulated results.  They </p><p>claim victory or at least a run-off is in order.  APGA </p><p>believes it is the strongest party in the Southeast and </p><p>that it should receive a commensurate number of National </p><p>Assembly seats and governorships.  The Yoruba-based AD </p><p>thinks it was betrayed by President Obasanjo, its leaders </p><p>hoodwinked into believing the PDP would not mount a strong </p><p>challenge to AD National Assembly and gubernatorial </p><p>incumbents if AD would support Obasanjo for president. </p><p>Accordingly, the AD did not contest the Presidency.  The </p><p>PDP, however, routed the AD in most of the Southwest, with </p><p>a brusque Obasanjo telling the incumbent AD governors to </p><p>"pack their bags and go." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Buhari is trying to gather the opposition parties </p><p>into an alliance to contest the results of the elections. </p><p>Already he has seized on the tough language in the EU </p><p>statement to back his call that people should not recognize </p><p>the government that gets inaugurated on May 29.  He is </p><p>attempting to get the other parties to endorse his tack and </p><p>to discuss other joint actions they can take to challenge </p><p>the results.  As opposition discusses ways to form a common </p><p>front against the surging PDP, the ruling party and the GON </p><p>seek ways and means to drive a wedge between the groups. </p><p>While many in the opposition can probably be sidelined with </p><p>money, contracts or offices, it would not be in character </p><p>for Buhari to budge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OUR PUBLIC POSITION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Our public position will be viewed against a </p><p>backdrop of escalating tension, political dealing and </p><p>rising anxiety regarding what we might say.  If our </p><p>criticism is too blunt, we risk radicalizing those who want </p><p>to upend the results.  This not only could undermine </p><p>internal stability with attendant risks for a less-than- </p><p>stable sub-region, it could also jeopardize the survival of </p><p>the very democratization process that a harsh statement </p><p>would be intended to champion.  On the other hand, we </p><p>cannot call this election credible.  Intelligent, informed </p><p>Nigerians know it was riddled with flaws, and increasingly </p><p>they mock the outcome in certain areas.  While an unduly </p><p>positive statement might discourage some from taking </p><p>extreme action, it would be inaccurate and undermine our </p><p>credibility in the long run.  It also would do nothing to </p><p>encourage an open, transparent and fair elections- </p><p>arbitration process, something the country desperately </p><p>needs in order to vent the pressure building in the </p><p>political boiler. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) Consequently, our statement should: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- acknowledge INEC\'s announcement, an ineluctable reality; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- applaud the efforts of the average Nigerian voter; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- point to the obvious and serious flaws and </p><p>irregularities; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- acknowledge the differences in the quality of elections </p><p>conducted among the various states; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- acknowledge the positive aspects of the election; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- commend leaders who have called on their supporters to </p><p>channel their grievances through peaceful means; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- call on those who are aggrieved to use the judicial </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>THE NEED FOR POLITICAL REFORM; WE CAN RAISE IT LATER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) What the system really needs is a political fix. </p><p>The tribunals are intended to handle a few cases of </p><p>scattered malfeasance and fraud.  This is a much larger, </p><p>nigh systemic problem.  However, it would be neither </p><p>appropriate nor effective for the USG to call for electoral </p><p>reform.  That would just invite invidious comparisons </p><p>(already spewing from the mouths of some GON flacks) with </p><p>Florida in 2000.  For now, the EU is taking much of the </p><p>heat.  We do not need to compete with the EU to prove our </p><p>democratic credentials. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
