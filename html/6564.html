<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001782 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS REPLY ON SEEBRIG ASSURANCES </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 201017 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action message.  Please see paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On March 17 polmiloff received a call from Oya Ergin of </p><p>the MFA NATO Department.  She informed that the GOT had </p><p>almost completed its review of the Reftel text we had </p><p>provided on October 16, 2002.  When the review is complete, </p><p>Post expects that there may be other issues for which we will </p><p>request Department guidance.  In the meantime, the Turks are </p><p>concerned that if the USG insists on their using the word </p><p>"agreement" in the MFA\'s response to the USG (as suggested in </p><p>Reftel paragraph 7), Turkish law and practice will require </p><p>that it be sent to the Prime Ministry for vetting and </p><p>approval.  Ergin predicted that going this route would take a </p><p>"long time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Action Request: At polmiloff\'s request, MFA provided its </p><p>preferred text for our review.  In lieu of "shall constitute </p><p>an agreement," the GOT proposes that it use "will be </p><p>considered as a political commitment."  Post requests the </p><p>Department\'s guidance on whether the GOT\'s choice of words is </p><p>acceptable to the USG.  End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
