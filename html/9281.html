<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003043 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL, JULY 8-9: NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: Opinion in Kuwait\'s media on how to characterize </p><p>the results of the parliamentary elections remains divided. </p><p>Some liberal commentators believe that Islamists now have </p><p>the upper hand, a notion that the bulk of editorial opinion </p><p>(and most post media contacts) dismiss as a fundamental </p><p>misreading of the situation. All newspapers prominently </p><p>report Islamist appeals for unity in the new Assembly and </p><p>the reported formation by the Islamist bloc of a wider </p><p>"conservative block" with non-Islamist MPs. </p><p> </p><p>Most papers report growing anticipation that de-facto head </p><p>of government Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad will be tapped by the </p><p>Amir on July 11 to be the new prime minister, replacing </p><p>ailing Crown Prince Sheikh Saad. Several commentators say </p><p>that effective government headed by a strong prime minister </p><p>is needed to overcome what one terms "the state of </p><p>confusion, stagnation and slump suffered by Kuwait over the </p><p>past few years." </p><p> </p><p>Allegations of vote buying appear in several editorials, </p><p>along with criticism of Kuwait\'s democracy as </p><p>"unrepresentative." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   News Stories:  All newspapers continue to analyze and </p><p>interpret the election results. Defeated incumbent and </p><p>liberal Ahmed Al-Rubie refutes claims that the new assembly </p><p>is an "Islamic parliament," while defeated incumbent and </p><p>Islamist, Mubarak Al-Duwaila, denies that the new assembly </p><p>is pro-government. Al-Seeyasah reports on July 8 that </p><p>Kuwaitis have rejected the Islamist movements and "defeated </p><p>their plan of Islamization of Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>In the July 8 edition of Al-Seyassah, editor-in-chief Ahmed </p><p>Al-Jarallah stated that interpreting the election results as </p><p>a victory for "radical extremists," as he says was reported </p><p>in the foreign media, is "entirely incorrect." Al-Jarallah </p><p>describes the Islamists in the new parliament as "moderate," </p><p>and posing no threat to U.S.-Kuwait relations. </p><p> </p><p>Conservative Salafi MP, Dr. Waleed Al-Tabtabie stated that </p><p>the Islamic block had improved its position with the </p><p>elections because most of its new MPs are independent </p><p>Islamists rather than associated with one of the two main </p><p>Islamist movements (the Salafis and the Islamic </p><p>Constitutional Movement) which will make it easy for them </p><p>cooperate with MPs of other political groups. </p><p> </p><p>On July 8, the spokesman of the Islamist Salafi movement, </p><p>Turki Al-Zafiri, warned against disunity among Islamists in </p><p>the National Assembly, and called on coordination between </p><p>Islamists to confront the pro-government block in the </p><p>assembly, Al-Rai Al-Aam reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports that Islamic block members agreed on July 8 </p><p>to open membership to non-Islamists, thereby creating a </p><p>"conservative block." </p><p> </p><p>Most papers predict that the Amiri decree commissioning the </p><p>formation of the new government will be issued either on </p><p>July 9 or 11. Editor-in-chief of Al-Qabas, Waleed Al-Nesf, </p><p>called on the Kuwaiti leadership to make decisive decisions </p><p>without delay, saying, "those who call for more time before </p><p>making a decision are also calling for more disunion and </p><p>separation." </p><p> </p><p>Most newspapers interpret the meeting of Acting Prime </p><p>Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed on July 8 with former </p><p>ministers and MPs as a sign that Sheikh Sabah will be </p><p>commissioned to form the new government. Speculation </p><p>continues over whether he will do so in his capacity as </p><p>Acting Prime Minister or as Prime Minister, the position </p><p>nominally held by Crown Prince Sheikh Saad. Al-Qabas and Al- </p><p>Seyassa learned from informed sources that four former </p><p>speakers of parliament advised the Amir to separate the </p><p>posts of Crown Prince and Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports the composition of the new Council of </p><p>Ministers will include four returning ministers from the </p><p>royal family and four other ministers that held portfolios </p><p>in the last government. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Confusion Bred By An Assembly Lacking Vision" </p><p>Liberal Salwa Al-Saeed wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(7/8):  "An analysis of the results of the election </p><p>indicates that the many unresolved issues in parliament will </p><p>remain unresolved, and that the parliament will hinder </p><p>progress on many issues related to the changes occurring in </p><p>the region. A specific example is an [Islamic Constitutional </p><p>Movement] MP who incited people against reform polices by </p><p>arguing that the 2003 National Assembly would focus on </p><p>granting women political rights, exploiting oil fields, </p><p>normalizing relations with Israel and waging war against </p><p>Islamists under the pretext of fighting terrorism. A </p><p>National Assembly with such MPs would undoubtedly sacrifice </p><p>national interests for their own individual interests and </p><p>lead Kuwait to turn against the current of change in the </p><p>world and into direct confrontation with its allies." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Where Does Reform Begin?" </p><p>Prominent liberal lawyer Hassan Al-Essa wrote in independent </p><p>Al-Qabas (7/8): "This National Assembly will be worse than </p><p>its predecessor. This Assembly perpetuates the priority </p><p>given to tribal affiliations over national loyalties.  The </p><p>Kuwaiti people have not grasped the changes that have </p><p>occurred, and will still occur, in the region. The American </p><p>Ambassador\'s message on the Fourth of July fell on deaf </p><p>ears. It is not true that youths voted for change. Instead, </p><p>they voted for backwardness and tradition. The youths voted </p><p>as if they were the elderly when they voted for conservatism </p><p>and extremist forces representing Bin Laden\'s comrades and </p><p>his sympathizers. It was not only the liberals who lost </p><p>during the elections, but also the moderate Islamists." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Complexity of the Islamic Movements in Kuwait" </p><p>Pro-Islamist Dr. Haifa Al-Sanousi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Rai Al-Aam (7/8): "The Islamic movements are too busy </p><p>fighting amongst themselves, and this is weakening their </p><p>collective efforts to unite and protect Sharia law. There is </p><p>no doubt that we are in need of a serious initiative that </p><p>seeks to unify all Islamic movements and to coordinate on </p><p>issues pertaining to the Quran. Regrettably, the Islamic </p><p>movements lack harmony due to contrasting ideologies. The </p><p>unintentional blend of the concepts of religion and politics </p><p>may inadvertently sanction some liberals to circulate their </p><p>own sick theories." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Knights" </p><p>Liberal Bader Sultan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (7/8): "Those who did not vote for [prominent </p><p>liberal incumbent] MP Al-Neibari will soon realize that they </p><p>have relinquished Kuwait\'s national interests in return for </p><p>a hearty meal or promises of a job. With the defeat of [five </p><p>leading liberal] candidates. democracy has lost strong men </p><p>who stood up against administrative and financial </p><p>corruption. [T]hey were disposed of in a way that appeared </p><p>to be democratic, but in reality was closer to bribery and </p><p>vote-buying." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Virtues of Democracy" </p><p>Saleh Al-Shayji wrote in independent Al-Anba (7/8): "We have </p><p>heard and seen for ourselves how the `democrats\' enslaved </p><p>their followers and electorates. Some of them bought off </p><p>their followers with their own money, and in some cases, </p><p>used money from other sources. In this light. [democracy] is </p><p>a game of frivolity, which enslaves the free. and brings to </p><p>power people who do not deserve the right to be the masters </p><p>of the nation." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "To the New Prime Minister, With Regards" </p><p>Liberal former MP Ahmed Al-Rubei wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Qabas (7/8): "An Amiri decree will be issued in the next few </p><p>days commissioning a new Prime Minister. Our hope is that he </p><p>would be a genuine leader for the Ministers. We also hope to </p><p>see an end to the role of \'acting\' Prime Minister, something </p><p>which has exhausted the political process." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "The Prime Minister in Charge" </p><p>Liberal former Secretary General of the Kuwait Democratic </p><p>Forum, Ahmed Al-Dayeen, wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(7/8): "If the new Prime Minister has serious intentions to </p><p>implement reforms, and a real ambition to avoid the state of </p><p>confusion, stagnation and slump suffered by Kuwait over the </p><p>past few years, then he must seek to establish a coherent </p><p>ministerial group and not a mix of discordant elements." </p><p> </p><p>10.  "Is This the Will of the Nation?" </p><p>Dr. Yaser Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (7/8): </p><p>"The National Assembly represents only thirteen percent of </p><p>all Kuwaitis. The National Assembly is comprised of some </p><p>deputies who support the will of those in power, and were </p><p>imposed on the assembly just to receive illegal benefits </p><p>from the system. In addition, one third of the National </p><p>Assembly is comprised of ministers who are forced to vote in </p><p>support of government decisions. Can we still consider the </p><p>Kuwaiti National Assembly a representative of the people\'s </p><p>will and a true determiner of this country?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
