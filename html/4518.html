<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008638 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/EX, EUR/SE, CA/PPT, DS/ITA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, OTRA, ASEC, AFIN, CPAS, AMGT, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ:  REQUEST FOR DEPARTMENT TO GRANT </p><p>AUTHORIZATION FOR ONW POLAD TO ACCOMPANY CODEL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 241093 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 </p><p>a-d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request for NEA/NGA, NEA/EX and </p><p>EUR/SE.  See paras 3-5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NOFORN) Embassy understands that Chairman of the Senate </p><p>Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) Senator Biden (D-DE), </p><p>Senator Hagel (R-NE), three SFRC professional staff members </p><p>and two military escorts (Codel Biden) desire to travel to </p><p>Turkey and to Salahuddin in northern Iraq December 4-6 </p><p>(reftel).  The Codel wishes to travel to Turkey via military </p><p>aircraft and then travel over land into northern Iraq via </p><p>Turkey -- all of which require GOT approval.  The Embassy </p><p>alerted the MFA to the proposed visit during a November 25 </p><p>meeting and requested GOT approval.  We also alerted the MFA </p><p>that the USG believes that Operation Northern Watch (ONW) </p><p>POLAD Jonathan Cohen should accompany the Codel during its </p><p>visit to northern Iraq.  The MFA responded positively to the </p><p>Codel\'s request to enter/exit northern Iraq from Turkey, but </p><p>said that, due to the Ramadan holiday, appropriate Turkish </p><p>government officials would not be available to meet with the </p><p>Codel December 6 in Ankara upon their return from northern </p><p>Iraq.  Embassy will provide a more complete report of </p><p>Burcuoglu\'s response to the Codel\'s request to travel to </p><p>northern Iraq via Turkey septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NOFORN) For NEA/NGA and EUR/SE:  Embassy requests that </p><p>the Department authorize ONW POLAD to accompany the Codel on </p><p>the visit.  As the USG\'s officer in the field, the ONW POLAD </p><p>has a firm grasp and understanding of not only the terrain </p><p>and the personalities in northern Iraq, but also the Turkish </p><p>position on northern Iraq, and therefore is well placed to </p><p>support the Senators\' visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NOFORN) For NEA/EX: We understand that NEA will provide </p><p>funding for ONW POLAD costs on such trips to northern Iraq. </p><p>We currently estimate trip costs for ONW POLAD will total </p><p>between USD 850 and USD 1000, including USD 650 in driver and </p><p>vehicle costs for Consulate Adana.  This estimate does not </p><p>include danger pay or any per diem costs inside northern </p><p>Iraq. (Note:  most, if not all meal, lodging and transport </p><p>expenses inside the north will be paid by hosts.  end note.) </p><p>Please provide fiscal data via classified cable slugged </p><p>Ankara for PMA/Cohen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) For CA/PPT: We understand no passport validations are </p><p>necessary for this type of official USG trip.  If this is </p><p>incorrect, please advise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NOTIFYING THE TURKS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NOFORN) During a November 25 meeting with MFA DG for </p><p>Middle Eastern Affairs Burcuoglu on another issue, DCM said </p><p>that Codel Biden wanted to travel to northern Iraq December </p><p>4-5 and requested GOT approval for the visit.  DCM also </p><p>alerted Burcuoglu that the USG believed it was necessary for </p><p>ONW POLAD to accompany the Codel.  Burcuoglu said that he </p><p>would first brief FM Yakis (he later said U/S Ziyal) and then </p><p>the MFA would have to brief the new government (i.e. the </p><p>Prime Minister), which would make the final decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NOFORN)  Burcuoglu telephoned DCM November 26 to say </p><p>the GOT had approved the Codel\'s proposal to enter and exit </p><p>northern Iraq via Turkey.  However, Burcuoglu said that due </p><p>to the Ramadan holiday (December 4 at 1300 through December </p><p>7), appropriate GOT officials would not be available for </p><p>meetings with the Codel on December 6, as the Codel desires. </p><p>(A more complete readout of Burcuoglu\'s response to the </p><p>Codel\'s request will be provided septel.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PROPOSED SCHEDULE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NOFORN) Below is the Codel\'s proposed schedule per </p><p>reftel: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 3 </p><p>- depart Andrews AFB in the evening </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 4 </p><p>--Arrive at an air base close to the Iraqi border. (Note:  We </p><p>understand the Codel is looking using Mardin in south eastern </p><p>Turkey.  Mardin is a civilian airport with limited operating </p><p>hours and capabilities.  We recommend the Codel use </p><p>Diyarbakir air base.  It can handle military and civilian </p><p>aircraft, and is not that much further from the Iraqi border </p><p>than Mardin.  end note.) </p><p>--Proceed to northern Iraq and travel to Salahuddin by land. </p><p>--Meeting with PUK leader Talabani, KDP leader Barzani (TBD) </p><p>--Overnight in Salahuddin </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Meeting with women\'s groups; </p><p>--Meeting with NGOs (re: potential humanitarian crisis in the </p><p>event of an operation in Iraq); </p><p>--Speak to students at University of Irbil; </p><p>--Visit refugee camp housing; </p><p>--Interview with Brent Sadler (CNN); </p><p>--possible visit to site of chemical weapons attack. </p><p>--Depart for Turkish border (late afternoon).  Cross border </p><p>into Turkey, proceed to military base and fly to Ankara via </p><p>military aircraft. </p><p>--Overnight in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 6 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--meeting with GOT officials. </p><p>--Depart Ankara aboard military aircraft for Incirlik. </p><p>Receive ONW brief.  Depart Incirlik en route Qatar </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S/NOFORN) We understand from our initial discussions with </p><p>one of the DOD military escorts that the Codel is making its </p><p>own transportation and security arrangements for all travel </p><p>within northern Iraq.  We therefore assume that Kurdish </p><p>organizations in northern Iraq are aware of the visit and </p><p>planning accordingly.  As far as requests from the Embassy, </p><p>we expect the Codel to request the following assistance: (1) </p><p>securing GOT approval to enter/exit northern Iraq via Turkey; </p><p>(2) securing GOT approval for right to land US military </p><p>aircraft at a Turkish base; (3) US Embassy/Consulate </p><p>assistance with ground transportation from the air base to </p><p>the Iraqi border on December 4/from the Iraqi border to the </p><p>air base on December 5; (4) hotel accommodations in Ankara </p><p>for the evening of December 5; and (5) appointments with GOT </p><p>officials on December 6.  On this last point, the Codel has </p><p>requested appointments with AK Party Chairman Erdogan or </p><p>Prime Minister Gul, and TGS CHOD Gen Ozkok.  For the purpose </p><p>of balance and optics, we recommend that the Codel request </p><p>meetings with PM Gul, FM Yakis and TGS CHOD Ozkok. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/NOFORN) If the Codel sticks with the proposed schedule </p><p>outlined in para 8 above, ONW POLAD would travel via </p><p>commercial air December 4 to Diyarbakir and meet the Codel </p><p>upon its arrival.  Codel and ONW POLAD would then drive in a </p><p>lightly armored USG vehicle (provided by Consulate Adana) </p><p>from that location to the Habur Gate border crossing that </p><p>same day.  After arriving at Habur, they would enter northern </p><p>Iraq.  After they complete their activities in northern Iraq, </p><p>the Codel would return to the Habur Gate border crossing and </p><p>reenter Turkey in the afternoon on December 5.  They would </p><p>then return to Diyarbakir air base via lightly armored USG </p><p>vehicle (supplied by Consulate Adana) and fly back to Ankara </p><p>in the evening of December 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S/NOFORN) We are unaware of what arrangements the Codel </p><p>and the Iraqi Kurdish groups have made for the Codel\'s </p><p>transportation within in northern Iraq.  That said, we </p><p>imagine the transportation and security will be similar to </p><p>that which is provided to ONW POLAD when he travels to </p><p>northern Iraq.  Specifically, we expect the Codel would </p><p>travel in northern Iraq via KDP and PUK (if the Codel enters </p><p>any PUK-controlled areas) Toyota Land Cruisers, and usually </p><p>be accompanied by a mid-level public affairs official from </p><p>one of those factions.  The KDP and PUK, respectively, would </p><p>typically provide 10-20 of their best-trained peshmerga </p><p>(fighters) as escorts.  One or two peshmerga usually travel </p><p>in USG passengers\' vehicle, and all of them carry automatic </p><p>weapons (usually Kalashnikovs).  KDP and PUK forces also take </p><p>steps to secure all roads through standard and, when </p><p>necessary, additional checkpoints.  KDP and PUK escorts would </p><p>be in regular communication with their respective </p><p>headquarters via radio and other means.  The Codel would </p><p>utilize local KDP, PUK and other translators as necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S/NOFORN) While northern Iraq is never completely safe </p><p>for USG travel, we believe that in the current situation the </p><p>ONW POLAD\'s presence would not increase the risk of this </p><p>trip.  Post defers to a USG threat assessment, but KDP and </p><p>PUK authorities have in the past provided sufficient security </p><p>guarantees.  Post also notes that the GOT will be well aware </p><p>of the Codel\'s activities and location while in northern Iraq </p><p>and could provide both security and extraction assistance if </p><p>necessary.  ONW POLAD will contact Embassy Ankara daily via </p><p>non-secure iridium phone, and Embassy Ankara personnel would </p><p>ensure that all relevant USG agencies (including CTF/ONW, </p><p>ODC, EUCOM and Washington) are kept informed.  Based on </p><p>information from other channels, we recommend that the Codel </p><p>not meet with Islamist representatives during this trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S/NOFORN) Embassy neither expects nor requests resources </p><p>from DoD or other USG agencies for extraction contingencies </p><p>for the ONW POLAD.  Post is coordinating with CTF/ONW, ODC, </p><p>EUCOM and State/NEA on security and safety questions for ONW </p><p>POLAD.  In case of emergency, POLAD would depart Iraq with </p><p>the assistance of the Iraqi Kurds and, if necessary, the GOT. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
