<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, INL, DRL AND G/TIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, NI, XX, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: REGIONAL TIP CONFERENCE A SUCCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  Embassy Abuja hosted a Trafficking in Persons </p><p>(TIP) Conference which brought together representatives </p><p>from nine USG missions in West and Central Africa and four </p><p>funding agencies/bureaus in Washington to forge an anti- </p><p>trafficking strategy for the region and coordinate future </p><p>programs with other donors and international organizations. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Representatives from U.S. Embassies in Togo, Benin, </p><p>Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, Cote d\'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea and </p><p>Nigeria joined Washington-based officials from DRL, INL, </p><p>Department of Labor (DOL) and USAID for a two-day regional </p><p>conference on Trafficking in Persons, hosted by Embassy </p><p>Abuja and Consulate Lagos December 4-5.  This conference </p><p>had been scheduled for October but was postponed after the </p><p>attacks of September 11.  A representative of the U.S. </p><p>Mission in Cameroon was invited but at the last minute </p><p>could not attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The first day of the conference, held at Consulate </p><p>Lagos, involved only USG participants, allowing the sharing </p><p>of information on trafficking profiles in the individual </p><p>countries and trends in the region. Participants also </p><p>learned of existing USG-funded programs that target TIP, </p><p>including DOL\'s impressive $4.3 million nine-country </p><p>regional program to fight child-trafficking through the </p><p>ILO\'s International Program for the Elimination of Child </p><p>Labor.  A representative from USAID/Washington\'s Office of </p><p>Women in Development offered a briefing on USAID\'s </p><p>Sustainable Tree Crop Program, an effort started with </p><p>exclusively environmental goals but which has recently </p><p>taken up the task of assessing the extent and underlying </p><p>factors of child trafficking to the cocoa farms of Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire.  Washington-based participants briefed the group </p><p>on various Washington-based sources of funding for </p><p>potential anti-TIP projects, including INL, ESF, DHRF, DOL </p><p>and USAID DA monies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. During the first\'s day working session the USG </p><p>representatives reviewed and added to a draft strategy </p><p>produced by the Africa Bureau\'s Regional Affairs Office. </p><p>After developing an over-arching goal for the strategy, the </p><p>group identified priority areas for USG anti-TIP programs, </p><p>drafted several short and long-term objectives to be </p><p>achieved under the three general categories of the USG\'s </p><p>International Anti-TIP Policy - Protection, Prosecution and </p><p>Prevention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The group also produced a list of tactical tools with </p><p>which to advance these objectives, namely: greater </p><p>diplomatic advocacy, both public and private, of TIP- </p><p>related issues; engagement of ECOWAS and other regional </p><p>organizations; collaboration with other donors to fund </p><p>programs of international organizations such as UNICEF, IOM </p><p>and ILO-IPEC that are already active in this field in West </p><p>and Central Africa; and improved intra-USG coordination of </p><p>resources and programs aimed at the TIP problem in the West </p><p>and Central African region.  (Note:  The revised draft </p><p>strategy will be sent to AF/RA after the COM\'s of the </p><p>participating U.S. Missions have had a chance to approve </p><p>the draft. End note)  All agreed that the strategy should </p><p>call for increased and better coordinated delivery of USG </p><p>resources allocated for anti-trafficking projects in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The regional and Washington representatives agreed that </p><p>voluntary prostitution, which is prevalent throughout the </p><p>region, should not be addressed by the strategy; rather our </p><p>collective efforts should be focused on the transnational </p><p>trafficking of children for labor exploitation and the sex </p><p>trafficking of girls and women (largely from Nigeria).  A </p><p>consensus also emerged on the need to place top priority on </p><p>prevention efforts, namely education and awareness </p><p>campaigns.  This arose from the acknowledgement that </p><p>attempts to rehabilitate the victims of trafficking in West </p><p>and Central Africa are extremely difficult; preventing new </p><p>victims is far more cost effective and prospects for </p><p>success appear brighter as many at-risk populations do not </p><p>appear well aware of the trafficking dangers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The second half of the conference, hosted by the </p><p>Ambassador at his residence, invited the participation of </p><p>five other donor governments represented by Nigeria-based </p><p>diplomats (the Netherlands, Norway, and Italy) and visitors </p><p>from London (Scotland Yard and National Criminal </p><p>Intelligence Service) and Brussels (Belgian Ministry of </p><p>Interior) as well as officials from the World Bank, the </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNICEF, the </p><p>UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP), </p><p>ECOWAS, and the Special Assistant to President Obasanjo on </p><p>Human Trafficking and Child Trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. The second day opened with an insightful briefing by </p><p>Anne Kielland, A Norwegian Child Survival Specialist who </p><p>had conducted a year-long research project into child </p><p>trafficking for labor in Benin for the World Bank. </p><p>Kielland briefed the group on the findings of her research, </p><p>which drew on a sampling of 6,000 households of more than </p><p>20,000 children -- making it the most reliable and </p><p>comprehensive study done to date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Kielland\'s study found predictable general linkages </p><p>between poverty and lack of education with a high incidence </p><p>of trafficking.  Surprisingly, however, her data shows that </p><p>it is the more affluent households within poor villages who </p><p>traffic their children at a higher rate.  Kielland believes </p><p>the economic expectations of these households are higher -- </p><p>basically greed leading to the "commodification" of </p><p>children -- and they have access to the networks outside of </p><p>their villages allowing them to "place" their children with </p><p>traffickers.  Also, the availability of primary education </p><p>in a village has no positive effect on trafficking, but a </p><p>secondary school does.  The presence of TVs and organized </p><p>sports (soccer) seem to encourage trafficking; animist </p><p>households tend to traffic more than Christian and Muslim </p><p>family units. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  The IOM briefed on its ongoing Nigeria program ($2.1 </p><p>million), which is funded by Belgium, the Netherlands and </p><p>Italy, as well as a new 9-country regional program ($4 </p><p>million) it hopes to start next year.  (Comment: The </p><p>Nigeria-based ILO-IPEC representative could not attend the </p><p>conference to brief on the ILO-IPEC\'s $4.3 million, three- </p><p>year program for nine countries, which is completely funded </p><p>by USDOL and represents the largest USG anti-TIP commitment </p><p>in the region. End Comment) UNICEF explained its expanding </p><p>programs both regional and country-specific to combat child </p><p>trafficking from children\'s rights perspective.  ECOWAS and </p><p>UNODCCP described their nascent efforts to deal with </p><p>trafficking by using the ECOWAS structure to improve legal </p><p>provisions dealing with TIP within member states.  The </p><p>group heard from the Nigerian President\'s Special Assistant </p><p>on Human Trafficking and Child Labor on how the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration has moved to address what is perceived as an </p><p>alarming rise in trafficking in and out of Nigeria, </p><p>including the President\'s plans to host a global summit on </p><p>TIP in Abuja next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment:  The conference gave the U.S. Missions in the </p><p>region a valuable opportunity to exchange views on the </p><p>trafficking problem as seen from their respective host </p><p>countries as well to engage others donors and international </p><p>organizations on improved coordination of anti-trafficking </p><p>programs.  Once circulated among the Embassies in the </p><p>region for approval by Chiefs of Mission, the draft </p><p>strategy produced by the conference will be transmitted to </p><p>the Department.  It should serve STATE/AF and other </p><p>Washington offices/agencies as a good foundation for </p><p>diplomatic and programmatic initiatives in the region.  We </p><p>look to STATE/AF for approval and elaboration of the </p><p>strategy, including clear next steps and possible </p><p>commitments of new resources for USG anti-TIP efforts in </p><p>the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
