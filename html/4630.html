<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 LAGOS 000076 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR REVIEW AND CLEARANCE BY BRIAN BROWNE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, NI, PBTS, PGOV, PHUM, PREF, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTHERN SECESSION UNLIKELY DESPITE TENSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS 071146Z DEC 02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES.  REASON:  1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  While electoral divisions are under growing </p><p>media scrutiny, most southern political analysts privately </p><p>acknowledge that fears of imminent secessionism are unfounded </p><p>at present. Though some disgruntled groups demand the </p><p>creation of their own state within the federation, most do </p><p>not call for complete severance.  Issues reinforcing </p><p>political cohesion in the South include momentum towards a </p><p>national conference, interest over upcoming elections, </p><p>potential spoils of oil revenue, and the ICJ ruling on </p><p>Bakassi.  Despite relative low risk at present, GON </p><p>sensitivity to any potential secessionist war may influence </p><p>decisions on domestic and foreign political issues.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CURRENT SOUTHERN SECESSIONIST RUMBLINGS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The latest secessionist threat was declared on </p><p>December 20, 2002 by Lagos-based lawyer Festus Keyamo, who </p><p>announced the creation of an "Unarmed Revolutionary Council" </p><p>to govern the "Future Republic of the Niger-Delta," complete </p><p>with flag, national anthem, and coat of arms.  According to </p><p>press reports, Keyamo warned that the "future republic" would </p><p>emerge if Nigeria failed to convene a sovereign national </p><p>congress, engage "true fiscal and political federalism," and </p><p>enact the on-shore/off-shore abrogation bill.  Keyamo hoped </p><p>the announcement would "raise the consciousness" of the </p><p>South-South\'s oil-producing states.  The movement\'s slogan is </p><p>"This is a revolution, and it must succeed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Other well-known southern groups with secessionist </p><p>tendencies or platforms include the Movement for the </p><p>Sovereign State for Biafra (MASSOB), the Ijaw Youth Congress </p><p>(IYC), the Egbesu Supreme Council, and the Coalition of Oodua </p><p>Self-determine Groups (COSEG), which consists of the Oodua </p><p>Peoples Congress (OPC), Oodua Liberation Movement (OLM), </p><p>Oodua Youth Movement (OYM), Yoruba Revolutionary Movement </p><p>(YOREM), and the Federation of Yoruba Consciousness and </p><p>Culture (FYCC).  These groups held a joint press conference </p><p>in September to decry the voter registration exercise, which </p><p>they charged was "tailored to favor the Hausa/Fulani North." </p><p>They publicly called for a UN plebiscite to determine </p><p>Nigeria\'s future, including the right to ethnic </p><p>self-determination and secession from the Federation.  The </p><p>groups pledged to "fight together for each nationality to be </p><p>independent and build her own sovereign state, as an </p><p>independent member of the United Nations." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SECESSION NOT IMMINENT, FOR NOW </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite rancorous posturing from some quarters and </p><p>debate over the Miss World fiasco, individuals from major </p><p>southern ethnic groups refute their compatriots\' claims to be </p><p>on the verge of secession.  Though fearful the situation may </p><p>change, Patriots leader Rotimi Williams told Poloffs on </p><p>November 15 that Nigeria "is not at a critical stage yet. </p><p>This is the opportunity stage to prevent deterioration of the </p><p>country."  As the head of a group of senior Nigerian </p><p>statesmen, Williams envisions that a worst-case scenario </p><p>could emerge whereby frustrated ethnic groups begin agitating </p><p>again for a "political breakaway," either through peaceful </p><p>negotiation or through war.  Although Williams expects the </p><p>GON would "crush" any violent rebellion, the underlying </p><p>discontent "will come again" if frustrations are not </p><p>addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Nigeria\'s older generation remembers the root causes </p><p>of conflict that led to the Biafran War\'s outbreak, but the </p><p>South\'s younger generation mostly remembers the war\'s </p><p>terrible consequences.  The idea of launching another civil </p><p>war repulses young professionals and workers from across the </p><p>South, many of whom were born during or survived childhood </p><p>through the war.  Throughout the southern states, stories can </p><p>be heard about the severe economic hardship endured through </p><p>the war years and beyond.  Many Southerners still recount </p><p>tragic fates suffered by family members who were killed </p><p>directly, by collateral violence, or through starvation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) TRACES OF UNITY AMIDST ETHNIC DIVERSITY.  Though </p><p>diminished since 1999, unifying forces of shared history and </p><p>political struggle against military rule hold meaning for </p><p>many Nigerians.  Ardent pessimists of Nigeria\'s cohesion </p><p>concede that traditional ethnic groups today are weaving a </p><p>new pattern in the nation\'s political cloth.  With near </p><p>consensus, the South sees the June 12, 1993 national election </p><p>as a major turning point, the effects of which continue to </p><p>reverberate.  Legborsi Saro Pyagbara of the Movement for the </p><p>Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) calls June 12 a "true </p><p>water-shed day" in which the public "forgot about ethnic </p><p>differences" to condemn the election\'s annulment.  Hundreds </p><p>of other analysts, pundits, poets and artists publicly share </p><p>his view. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>FIX IT AND MAKE US PART OF IT, OR WE\'LL ABANDON IT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ON-GOING CALLS FOR A NATIONAL CONVENTION.  Most </p><p>critics of the status quo focus on improving Nigeria\'s </p><p>legitimacy, threatening secession only as a last resort.  The </p><p>two most frequent proposals to redress on-going southern </p><p>grievances are to hold a national convention and to </p><p>decentralize federal resource control.  The most popular </p><p>incarnations of these ideas are the "sovereign" national </p><p>convention and the on-shore/off-shore abrogation bill.  The </p><p>national conference proposal has been floated for years </p><p>without much forward momentum.  NGOs regularly lobby and </p><p>educate key political figures on the potential benefits of </p><p>such an exercise, hoping to convince powerbrokers that one </p><p>could be held without negating entrenched interests. </p><p>Reformists and NGOs seeking long-term stability argue that </p><p>geopolitical groups must send their respective </p><p>representatives to forge a new social compact on unity and </p><p>the role of Nigerian government.  Serious, divisive issues </p><p>impeding national cooperation must be discussed openly in a </p><p>forum to devise new rules about how differences will be </p><p>peaceably settled.  The meaningful legitimacy of the current </p><p>constitution is dangerously low, they warn, as it is a </p><p>document inherited from military rulers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The South-South "in particular feels strongly that </p><p>areas have been neglected," Williams asserts.  For this </p><p>reason, his Patriots group advocates restructuring the </p><p>constitution to eliminate the belief that "no one will ever </p><p>be president from the South-South" and that "unless one </p><p>belongs to the majority ethnic groups, one stands no chance </p><p>at all."  To Williams, as long as Nigerian minority groups </p><p>feel they are treated as "second class citizens," a serious </p><p>threat to cohesion exists.  He believes minority groups will </p><p>not even try to contest in a system that seems to guarantee </p><p>rule by groups historically dominating Nigerian politics. </p><p>Asked whether "zoning", the presidency according to </p><p>ethnicity does not encourage tribal divisions, Williams </p><p>disagreed.  He argued that if society is to "mature" toward </p><p>equal opportunity devoid of ethnic opportunism, an </p><p>institutionalized power-sharing arrangement must be </p><p>implemented at least on a short-term basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While some Nigerians fear a national convention would </p><p>re-ignite disgruntled groups\' secessionist tendencies, others </p><p>argue such a meeting would diffuse underlying tensions and </p><p>initiate a productive way forward.  The Committee for the </p><p>Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) claims that a national </p><p>convention will "raise Nigerians\' adrenaline but not lead us </p><p>to kill ourselves."  Had a convention been "called during the </p><p>military years, the Niger Delta would have called for </p><p>secession," CDHR posits.  In today\'s civilian climate, </p><p>particularly with the Bakassi issue at present (paragraphs </p><p>11-12), a national conference is unlikely to fan the embers </p><p>of secessionism, they argue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Meanwhile, some groups are calling for the creation </p><p>of their own state within the federation.  One of the groups </p><p>most disappointed by the nation\'s lack-luster performance in </p><p>meeting public needs is the Ogoni people of Rivers State. </p><p>The Ogoni believe they were martyred as a people for Nigerian </p><p>democracy, but many resent receiving so few dividends to </p><p>date.  In meetings held during a recent fact-finding mission </p><p>by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), </p><p>the National Commissioner for Refugees, and Poloffs, Ogoni </p><p>members asserted that their only hope was to have an Ogoni </p><p>state with its own resources administered according to their </p><p>own decisions (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>MUTUAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN INTRIGUE:  WHAT IF . . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) BAKASSI AND THE LIMITS OF ETHNIC AUTONOMY.  CDHR </p><p>thinks the October 10 ruling on Bakassi by the International </p><p>Court of Justice further diminished the South\'s impulse </p><p>towards secessionism by reminding it of its need for northern </p><p>military coverage.  "Bakassi has reminded the South that we </p><p>live better together," remarked Belo Aideloje, Secretary </p><p>General of CDHR. Combining the regions together, "Nigeria is </p><p>seen as so mighty that no one (e.g. Cameroon) could stand up </p><p>to it."  The "mutual need for security" has sparked a "spirit </p><p>of kith and kinship among communities of the South-South, </p><p>South-East, and South-West," claims CDHR. Therefore, </p><p>perceived mutual security needs has undercut ethnic </p><p>animosities, they conclude.  "There is an overestimation of </p><p>the strength of ethnic groups.  Each tribe knows its limits. </p><p>People are careful to not be pushed outside the tensile </p><p>strength of their own group," CDHR explains.  Yet, it </p><p>concedes that these ties have not been as well developed </p><p>between the South and the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Another source discounts the mutual security theory, </p><p>claiming Obasanjo\'s true agenda is in fact to replace </p><p>northern hegemony of the armed forces with diversified </p><p>officers at the lower ranks.  Proceeding slowly, carefully </p><p>and quietly, avoiding media attention which would unravel the </p><p>whole endeavor, Obasanjo has progressed to the point that the </p><p>South no longer depends on the North for military support, he </p><p>argues.  Nevertheless, CDHR asserts, the South still believes </p><p>military power is a northern product, a perception which </p><p>reinforces cohesion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) COTE D\'IVOIRE AND THE WEST.  External observers </p><p>believe the GON\'s lingering memories of foreign roles in </p><p>secessionist disputes affects its present decision-making on </p><p>international affairs. Eusebe Hounsokou, Representative for </p><p>Nigeria of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, </p><p>thinks GON is with-holding direct military aid to Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire because of a grudge held since civil war.  Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire was reputedly an arms conduit to Biafran insurgents. </p><p> Should a similar conflict erupt here, many Nigerians ask </p><p>what foreign actors, including the United States, would do. </p><p>"When the critical time comes," Williams asserts, "I hope no </p><p>foreign government will encourage any group to breakaway.  I </p><p>hope they instead will encourage the government in power not </p><p>to ignore the problem or crush (the rebels)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>RIVALRY FOR SCARCE RESOURCES: STEEP CHALLENGES AHEAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Many, if not most, analysts fear uneven resource </p><p>distribution and economic hardship are steadily corroding the </p><p>country\'s stability.  Daily street scuffles across the South </p><p>have varied causes, but some relate to the question of </p><p>national unity. George Ehusani, Secretary General of the </p><p>Catholic Secretariat, blames most of the violence on poverty, </p><p>which impedes Nigeria\'s forming "a melting pot like the </p><p>United States."  Given "impoverished conditions," he finds it </p><p>unsurprising that violence erupts with "people biting each </p><p>other."  Competition over resources is often expressed as a </p><p>conflict between "indigenes" and "settlers," two concepts </p><p>whose precise definitions can differ wildly from one village </p><p>to the next.  Ehusani sees most of Nigeria\'s current threats </p><p>to cohesion in these terms, including the complexities of </p><p>expanding Shari\'a. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Ehusani, who traveled to Kigali last fall, is </p><p>publishing his analysis of potential lessons Nigeria can </p><p>learn from the Rwandan genocide.  He fears "ethnic </p><p>antipathies, combined with long-standing issues of perceived </p><p>or real injustice, mixed with severe economic depression" </p><p>could spark similar mass violence in Nigeria.  While the </p><p>military regimes "suppressed genocidal sentiments," under </p><p>democracy, the situation now may be "boiling over." </p><p>"Disorganized violence," Ehusani argues, is manifest between </p><p>poor individuals.  "If violence is organized by a Big Man," </p><p>on the other hand, he fears it is used in Nigeria to </p><p>"manipulate the Small Man versus the Small Man to the gain of </p><p>the elite."  He claims religious teachings of peace and </p><p>forgiveness are the main deterrents to all-out class warfare </p><p>and mass violence in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Nigerian unity may prove more resilient than expected </p><p>from a cursory glance at the headlines on present violence </p><p>and political posturing.  Following Ehusani\'s theory of </p><p>Nigerian conflict, one might ask what a "Big Man" might </p><p>expect to gain from an organized secessionist movement and </p><p>whether current political conditions make this strategy </p><p>attractive.  At the moment, Southerners are asserting their </p><p>agendas tenaciously within the actual political framework and </p><p>appear willing to see what opportunities may be yielded by </p><p>upcoming elections.  "Big Men" are busily seeking to maximize </p><p>their share in the present political arena; "Small Men" are </p><p>waiting to see what will happen next. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Uncertainty about the elections\' potential outcome is </p><p>generating excitement, nervousness, and speculation.  Still, </p><p>the expectation that elections will indeed be held as </p><p>scheduled in April and May is surprisingly widespread in the </p><p>South.  This expectation seems to be putting frustrations </p><p>over the slow pace of progress on hold, even as challengers </p><p>to incumbent officials engage rhetoric that is increasing </p><p>public attention to problems the government has left </p><p>unsolved.  In some cases, anger over unresponsive government </p><p>is being channeled into determination that the next </p><p>government will be more responsive to their needs.  Sincere </p><p>or not, opportunists will keep threatening to secede to mount </p><p>pressure on an otherwise unresponsive government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) While the loudest commentators clamor for their </p><p>ethnic group\'s representation at the government\'s helm, </p><p>candidates who adopt popular issues in their platforms may </p><p>bolster Southerners\' commitment to democracy and the nation. </p><p>Issues are not yet in vogue among politicians, but issues </p><p>such as infrastructure, health care, and employment have </p><p>nationwide relevance and popularity (septel).  A few </p><p>forward-thinking politicians are testing the plausibility of </p><p>capitalizing on some issues\' popularity for their political </p><p>ambitions.  General Ibrahim Babangida, one of the savviest </p><p>politicians, recently condoned the possible utility of a </p><p>national conference (reftel).  However contrived a </p><p>convention\'s outcome, the mere exercise would be highly </p><p>welcomed by many Southerners.  Politicians also have yet to </p><p>exploit the positive nation-building sentiments related to </p><p>the June 12, 1993 events.  How to seize the spirit of unity </p><p>engendered by the events without raising painful memories or </p><p>embarrassing past political actors remains problematic. </p><p>Creative and nation-minded leaders may find a way yet.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
