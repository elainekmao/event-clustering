<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0142 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>AND PRM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY HOPEFUL FOR </p><p>          CHANGE BUT EXPERIENCING LITTLE </p><p>          IMPROVEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified; </p><p>please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: A cross-section of GOT </p><p>officials, NGOs, and businessmen in Turkey\'s </p><p>Southeast reveals little, if any, change in </p><p>economic or social conditions.  Lower-level GOT </p><p>officials, unaccustomed to and uncomfortable </p><p>with meeting foreign diplomats, paint an </p><p>unrealistic picture, touting the Southeast as a </p><p>model for other developing countries.  Many of </p><p>these officials assert that economic conditions </p><p>are improving and were not affected by the </p><p>recent war in Iraq and that human rights </p><p>violations rarely occur.  However, according to </p><p>our NGO contacts, the economic situation </p><p>remains stagnant and social conditions have not </p><p>changed since the third EU reform package was </p><p>passed in August 2002.  Kurdish contacts </p><p>anticipate a resolution of Kurdish-Turkish </p><p>tensions.  However, they associate this </p><p>resolution with increased US participation and </p><p>continue to think that the rise in awareness of </p><p>the Kurdish problem in the international arena </p><p>is a major step in compelling Ankara to begin </p><p>serious efforts to mend ties with citizens of </p><p>Kurdish origin.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Mid-Level Civil Servants Report An Easy Life, </p><p>Fear of Superiors, and a Party Line . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Poloff met with a wide variety of </p><p>provincial education and health directors, sub- </p><p>governors, and local NGOs and prominent </p><p>citizens in Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Hilvan, and </p><p>Diyarbakir between May 13-16.  While most of </p><p>our scheduled appointments were eager to meet </p><p>with us, some provincial education and health </p><p>directors did not appear or sent their deputies </p><p>to meet with us.  As it was explained, either </p><p>the directors were "in another meeting" or they </p><p>did not have the permission of their superiors </p><p>to meet with us.   Often, the deputies were </p><p>enthusiastic to discuss their roles, </p><p>workplaces, and issues relating to working in </p><p>the Southeast.  Aside from these contacts, many </p><p>of those who did meet with us gave an </p><p>identical, too rosy picture of conditions in </p><p>the Southeast: in the health system, almost </p><p>every child is immunized, birth control and </p><p>population control is taught, there are no </p><p>language or communication barriers, and there </p><p>is adequate health care in each village; in the </p><p>education system, all children are provided </p><p>schooling and high school attendance is on the </p><p>rise, there are no language or communication </p><p>barriers, and technology is the only thing </p><p>lacking in their schools. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>... But Lower Level Contacts Bemoan Bureaucratic </p><p>    Nightmares </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In contrast, the deputies assigned to </p><p>speak with us often portrayed a different </p><p>picture.  In Diyarbakir\'s Social Security </p><p>Hospital, the hospital director spoke of </p><p>bureaucratic nightmares in which he had been </p><p>corresponding with his central ministry in </p><p>Ankara in order to fix a broken piece of </p><p>equipment for three months and still had yet to </p><p>receive the funding to repair it.  According to </p><p>procedures, all appointments must be made </p><p>through an appointment system; however, many </p><p>women speak only Kurdish and are unable to </p><p>obtain an appointment on their own.  Often, </p><p>these women must rely on a male family member </p><p>to translate and choose not to receive medical </p><p>care if the condition is of a private nature. </p><p>The central headquarters also seems to place a </p><p>higher emphasis on new buildings, rather than </p><p>staff; Sanliurfa\'s State Hospital is expected </p><p>to move into a new 500-bed hospital in August </p><p>2003 but, according to its deputy chief doctor, </p><p>"while it will be nice to have a new facility, </p><p>it is even more important to have a full </p><p>staff."  Nurses are in high demand and the </p><p>shortage is so great that ten nurses (of the </p><p>100 employed at this hospital) miscarried due </p><p>to the strenuous load of hours they worked. </p><p>Sanliurfa\'s deputy chief doctor summed up the </p><p>situation by stating, "the only efficient </p><p>system within the GOT is the military; if the </p><p>GOT adopted a similar system to healthcare, we </p><p>would have the capability to utilize our </p><p>resources to effectively care for our </p><p>patients."  Many of our health contacts also </p><p>expressed optimistic skepticism for the </p><p>Ministry of Health\'s plans to refresh Turkey\'s </p><p>healthcare system: "we have heard it before but </p><p>will be pleased to see it happen this time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The education system also shares some </p><p>language problems but the primary issue remains </p><p>attracting girls to school and getting all </p><p>students to continue to high school.  In </p><p>Hilvan, there are approximately 9700 students </p><p>attending school; of these roughly 500 attend </p><p>secondary school while 9200 attend the </p><p>compulsory primary school.  The Provincial </p><p>Education director atributes this wide </p><p>discrepancy to wealthier parents sending their </p><p>children to school in Sanliurfa.  (Note: Hilvan </p><p>is not known to be a wealthy province and </p><p>poloff noticed more horses and carts than cars </p><p>in the city center.  End note.)  Girls have </p><p>begun to enter school but some of our contacts </p><p>estimate that 70 percent of the region\'s female </p><p>population remains illiterate.  In one of </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s newest high schools, the principal </p><p>spends approximately half of his time </p><p>soliciting local businesses and the Ministry of </p><p>Education for money and equipment to outfit his </p><p>school. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Still a Man\'s World </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Almost every NGO contacted stated that </p><p>the human rights situation in Southeastern </p><p>Turkey had not changed for the better after the </p><p>EU reform package was passed in August 2002 or, </p><p>for that matter, in the last five years. </p><p>Kurdish language broadcasting, guaranteed under </p><p>the EU reform package, still has yet to be seen </p><p>in a regular, unobstructed way and activists </p><p>often cite conflicting laws within the GOT and </p><p>general GOT unwillingness as primary reasons. </p><p>Prison guards often disconnect inmates and </p><p>family members who speak in Kurdish during </p><p>visiting hours.  Torture continues freely </p><p>against inmates accused of being PKK- </p><p>affiliated; although the torture inflicted is </p><p>often more mental than physical and the </p><p>physical beatings are confined to those that </p><p>will leave the least lasting physical effects. </p><p>6. (SBU) According to KA-MER, a Diyarbakir-based </p><p>woman\'s group, suicides amongst women and girls </p><p>are on the rise in the Southeast, especially in </p><p>Diyarbakir and Batman.  KA-MER worries, that </p><p>because these deaths are rarely investigated, </p><p>many of them could be honor killings designed </p><p>to look like suicides.  According to KA-MER\'s </p><p>founder, the lack of education combined with </p><p>economic hardships and a strict religion </p><p>propels many families to take this drastic </p><p>action against their daughters who have or have </p><p>been perceived to bring dishonor to the family. </p><p>The organization applauds the local </p><p>municipality for its help in arranging </p><p>replacement identification cards to women who </p><p>have sought KA-MER\'s protection.  Women in </p><p>Southeastern Turkey continue to play a </p><p>traditional, uneducated role and remain tied to </p><p>the male members of the family\'s wishes for </p><p>food, shelter, and education. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A Renewed Kurdish Hope </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Kurds living in Southeastern Turkey </p><p>describe to us a cautious hope for a resolution </p><p>to what they see as heir main problems because </p><p>it appears the Kurds will play a role in the </p><p>new Iraqi government and their situation has </p><p>been propelled to the international arena. </p><p>However, our contacts frequently warn that, </p><p>without US support, a resolution will not </p><p>happen.  "We support the US war in Iraq but we </p><p>also support the GOT\'s failure to pass the </p><p>February motion allowing US troops in Iraq </p><p>because, had the government passed the motion, </p><p>Turkish troops would have moved into Northern </p><p>Iraq and the Kurdish role would have </p><p>diminished." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Officials\' apprehension, or failure, to </p><p>meet with us and the deliverance of the same </p><p>party line given to us by many GOT bureaucrats </p><p>portrays a strong fear of repercussion by their </p><p>superiors.  It is curious to note how some of </p><p>our appointments would usher us out the door </p><p>after a few minutes of small talk in order not </p><p>to be accused of discussing something </p><p>inappropriate.  In meetings with higher level </p><p>officials, including the new Diyarbakir </p><p>governor, we were given a biased, but clearer </p><p>view of the region: "there are still problems, </p><p>namely within healthcare and education, but our </p><p>situation is improving daily."  Also, we heard </p><p>that many mid-level GOT bureaucrats often </p><p>choose to extend their tours in the region </p><p>because of the "easy way of life."  They are </p><p>often provided added monetary incentives and </p><p>enjoy an elite standing in the province.  These </p><p>officials frequently seem satisfied with the </p><p>status quo and seemed to prefer not taking the </p><p>extra steps it would require to improve much of </p><p>their territory because it could potentially </p><p>upset their way of life.
