<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004316 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF MISSION BEGINS TALKS AMID GROWING MARKET ANGST </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4180 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  An IMF team began talks in Ankara this </p><p>afternoon amid growing market nervousness over U.S.-Turkish </p><p>relations and continued delays in meeting the conditions for </p><p>the Fifth Review under the IMF-backed program. Treasury U/S </p><p>Canakci told us the government still is shooting for an IMF </p><p>Board Review by the end of the month, but he admitted the GOT </p><p>still has much work to do to address the fiscal gap and pass </p><p>legislation to restructure Turkey\'s various social security </p><p>funds.  Canakci also confirmed that the government will </p><p>shortly replace all three of his deputies; he insisted that </p><p>the replacements would reassure the markets.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) An IMF mission began talks with GOT officials this </p><p>afternoon on the remaining steps to be taken for the Fifth </p><p>Review under the IMF-backed economic reform program.  The </p><p>talks began as markets continued to slide, with bond yields </p><p>on the benchmark t-bill rising to 56 percent and the lira </p><p>weakening to TL 1.42 million/dollar.  Market analysts </p><p>attributed the decline to growing nervousness over </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations (in the wake of the July 4 U.S. </p><p>detention of Turkish special forces personnel in Northern </p><p>Iraq), delays in completion of the Fifth Review, and press </p><p>reports that all three Treasury Deputy Undersecretaries would </p><p>be sacked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Treasury U/S Canakci told us this morning that the </p><p>GOT still hopes to complete the review this month.  He noted </p><p>that Parliament had already approved legislation </p><p>restructuring the state unemployoment agency (Is-Kur), and </p><p>that the Budget Committee is now debating legislation to </p><p>restructure the Bag-Kur and SSK social security funds (press </p><p>reports indicate the Commitee approved the SSK legislation </p><p>late today).  Canakci said the government had given up on the </p><p>idea of making these bills "fundamental laws," which would </p><p>have put them on a legislative fast-track; however, the </p><p>opposition CHP had agreed to work with the government to </p><p>accelerate passage of both bills.  The government also has </p><p>been unable to reach agreement with the IMF on language about </p><p>rescheduling social security arrears.  Despite the GOT\'s best </p><p>efforts, Fund staff continue to worry that the government has </p><p>in mind a general amnesty or rescheduling, which would </p><p>violate the terms of the last LOI.  As a result, the </p><p>government has left rescheduling language out of the </p><p>legislation.  (Note:  Canakci confirmed that expectations of </p><p>a social security amnesty has caused a decline in social </p><p>security premium payments, especially to the Bag-Kur fund.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Canakci admitted that the government still had not </p><p>agreed on all of the measures needed to close the fiscal gap </p><p>that the previous IMF mission had identified.  That gap, he </p><p>said, was equal to 0.4 percent of GNP or about TL 1.05 </p><p>quadrillion ($750 million at today\'s exchange rate).  The </p><p>cabinet is now considering a decree to increase the Special </p><p>Transaction Tax and an educational levy; if approved, this </p><p>would reduce the gap by approximately TL 250 trillion. </p><p>Treasury plans to cover the remaining TL 750 trillion gap via </p><p>a combination of electricity price increases (TL 500 </p><p>trillion) and other measures yet to be identified; however, </p><p>the Energy Minister continues to oppose electricity price </p><p>increases.  In addition, the outcome of ongoing wage/salary </p><p>negotiatons with civil servants could add to the fiscal gap, </p><p>though Canakci insisted the government would remain tough and </p><p>limit the fiscal damage.  (Note:  IMF ResRep has previously </p><p>told us the fiscal gap was slightly larger, at 0.5 percent of </p><p>GNP, and also has pointed out that it may be revised, </p><p>depending on the current mission\'s review of budget results </p><p>through end-June.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On other structural conditions, Canakci </p><p>acknowledged that the GOT was behind schedule on eliminating </p><p>redundant employees in state enterprises.  It has eliminated </p><p>7400 redundant positions, against an end-June target of 9900. </p><p> He predicted that this process would accelerate as soon as </p><p>the ongoing civil service wage negotiations conclude.  On </p><p>Turk Telekom, he echoed IMF ResRep in saying that the Fund </p><p>had agreed that the GOT would work with the World Bank to </p><p>name a privatization coordinator (already done) and put in </p><p>place a full privatization strategy by Fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Canakci also confirmed press reports that all three </p><p>of his deputies would be replaced shortly.  In fact, the </p><p>document authorizing their removal is now with the Prime </p><p>Minister for approval.  Canakci said the government had not </p><p>yet decided on replacements, but he insisted they would be </p><p>well-qualified people who would inspire confidence in the </p><p>markets.  (Note:  IMF ResRep told us last night that he </p><p>understood one of the replacements would be a highly-regarded </p><p>official from the State Planning Organization.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Finally, Canakci expressed optimism about economic </p><p>trends, noting that growth was trending up while inflation </p><p>was declining.  If present trends continue, he said, Turkey </p><p>could end the year with growth above five percent, inflation </p><p>close to the 20 percent annual target, and a net public </p><p>debt/GNP ratio at 74-75 percent, below the 77.2 percent </p><p>year-end target.  We responded that such a positive scenario </p><p>was indeed possible, and suggested that vigorous, consistent </p><p>implementation of the economic reform program could help </p><p>ensure it.  We noted that much of the projected decline in </p><p>the debt/GNP ratio depended on the continued strength of the </p><p>lira, and that real interest rates remained very high because </p><p>investors remained unsure of the government\'s commitment to </p><p>reform.  Rapid movement by the government now to complete the </p><p>Fifth Review and otherwise move the reform process forward </p><p>would be of great benefit in the Fall, when investors will </p><p>try to determine whether and how Turkey will meet its large </p><p>2004 debt obligations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
