<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001449 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PM/B- M. LINO </p><p>FOR AF/W, L, T, IO, S/WCI, D, P </p><p>DOD FOR OSD/ISP/NP - BILLINGSLEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/6/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KTIA, MARR, NI, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT </p><p>DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 84875 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) With Foreign Minister Lamido in Kano because of </p><p>the May 4 airplane crash (Lamido is from Kano), </p><p>Ambassador delivered referenced talking points to </p><p>Presidential Advisor Ad\'obe Obe. (Obe was joined by </p><p>his Special Assistant who served as his notetaker.) </p><p>The Ambassador emphasized the Rome Statute would </p><p>infringe national sovereignty, place a chilling effect </p><p>on a country\'s participation in peacekeeping missions </p><p>and undermine the authority of the UN Security </p><p>Council. Obe took on the points positively, stating </p><p>that he would relay our concerns to the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On May 7, Ambassador met FM Lamido who had </p><p>returned from Kano. The Ambassador delivered the same </p><p>message to Lamido, stating that Nigeria should be </p><p>particularly concerned given its active participation </p><p>in peacekeeping operations, both those undertaken by </p><p>the sub-region as well as under UN mandate. Lamido </p><p>responded that Nigeria understood and would respect </p><p>our position. However, he opined that as the universal </p><p>beacon "of hope and justice," the United States should </p><p>be party to the ICC. He remarked the national </p><p>sovereignty argument was powerful but double-edged. </p><p>With the USG now asserting this claim, other countries </p><p>could more easily invoke the same doctrine to thwart </p><p>international consideration of issues, such as human </p><p>rights concerns in specific countries. The Ambassador </p><p>underscored the USG was not opposed to some </p><p>international oversight and investigation of egregious </p><p>crimes but simply that the ICC was a flawed </p><p>instrument. He stated that national judicial </p><p>mechanisms and, when necessary, ad hoc international </p><p>tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and </p><p>Rwanda were more appropriate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A politician not very conversant with past </p><p>allegations against some Nigerian peacekeeping forces, </p><p>Lamido did not grasp the argument that the ICC </p><p>possibly could seek jurisdiction over Nigerian </p><p>peacekeepers. Discounting the potentiality, he stated </p><p>Nigeria only participated in internationally approved </p><p>PKOs. Thus, he could not foresee the ICC prosecutor </p><p>indicting members of a PKO that had been approved by </p><p>the UNSC. For him, the ICC was no threat to the UNSC\'s </p><p>authority. The mentioning of the UNSC spurred a </p><p>protracted monologue by Lamido, in which he managed to </p><p>string together almost every major African leitmotifs </p><p>in the global North-South dialogue, from Security </p><p>Council expansion to debt relief. (That part of the </p><p>meeting is reported septel.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) If Lamido\'s position holds sway, we should not </p><p>expect much support but also need not worry about </p><p>opposition from Nigeria. However, when more </p><p>experienced, discerning eyes look at this, they may </p><p>see that Nigeria\'s national interests are better </p><p>served by following the track we have chosen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
