<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, CA, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: CAFTA LABOR TRACK TWO DEMARCHE: GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 186063 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1313 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Labor Attache Erik Hall.  Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Embassy welcomes Department\'s proposal, </p><p>outlined in Ref A, to demarche Central American Ambassadors </p><p>in Washington to emphasize the need for progress on labor </p><p>rights protections in the context of CAFTA negotiations, and </p><p>appreciates the opportunity to provide input for the demarche </p><p>to the Guatemalan Ambassador.  Such a demarche complements </p><p>the bilateral consultation process begun in the context of </p><p>review of GSP petitions and on the margins of the Guatemala </p><p>round of CAFTA in May.  Given that bilateral consultations </p><p>are ongoing, Embassy recommends that the demarche reemphasize </p><p>the themes of putting an end to impunity for attacks on labor </p><p>leaders, streamlining of the labor justice system, and </p><p>effective enforcement of judicial reinstatement orders.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The next meeting of the bilateral working group on </p><p>labor rights issues will be held on July 10.  The Ambassador </p><p>will attend the meeting, convoked by the MFA at our request. </p><p>The GOG will be represented by the Labor Minister, Attorney </p><p>General, Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Trade </p><p>Unionists, a Supreme Court magistrate, and other interested </p><p>GOG representatives.  We requested the meeting to maintain </p><p>momentum and show sustained USG interest in progress on key </p><p>labor rights problems in the context of GSP review and CAFTA </p><p>track two efforts. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The three issue areas we have consistently </p><p>emphasized, in coordination with the Department, have been: </p><p> </p><p>-- Combating Impunity for Violence Against Trade Unionists: </p><p>by achieving progress in open investigations of violent </p><p>crimes against union leaders; </p><p> </p><p>-- Streamlining the Labor Justice System:  to strengthen </p><p>labor rights and rule of law by making labor justice more </p><p>swift; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Enforcing Reinstatement Orders for Illegally-Fired </p><p>Workers:  to add credibility to the labor justice system by </p><p>making judicial orders enforceable and providing relief to </p><p>workers in egregious cases of illegal firings for unionizing </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>Specific Cases </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Within the three thematic areas listed above, there </p><p>are some specific cases which could be cited to the </p><p>Guatemalan Ambassador.  The investigation of the June 23, </p><p>2000 murder of Transport Union General Secretary Oswaldo </p><p>Monzon Lima is one such case, among six assassinations of </p><p>trade unionists since 1999, where evidence implicates </p><p>management for responsibility for the crime.  On the issue of </p><p>labor justice, we have noted the GOG\'s recent procedural </p><p>reforms submitted to Congress, but emphasize the need to </p><p>redouble efforts to achieve further-reaching consensual </p><p>reforms in the National Subcommission on Labor Justice, which </p><p>involves active participation by the Ministry of Labor, the </p><p>judiciary, employers, unions, academics, and others. </p><p>Ironically, the Minister of Labor bypassed the Subcommission </p><p>when introducing his reform package to Congress (where it </p><p>remains pending), perhaps preferring that more visible step </p><p>to consensus building.  The most egregious unresolved case of </p><p>unenforced labor court orders for reinstatement of illegally </p><p>fired employees is the case of the agricultural workers at </p><p>the Finca Maria Lourdes, in Quezaltenango province.  There, </p><p>the courts have issued seven separate rulings, none of which </p><p>have been carried out,  reinstating 55 workers illegally </p><p>fired in 1995 for attempting to organize a union.  There are </p><p>many other similar cases. </p><p> </p><p>Some Signs of Progress </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) By convoking the ministerial working group, we hope </p><p>to build on the initial meeting on May 13, where some </p><p>positive steps were reported by the GOG (Ref B), including: </p><p>the naming of a new Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against </p><p>Trade Unionists, new labor rights reforms introduced to </p><p>Congress by the Portillo Administration, expansion of labor </p><p>court access to every Guatemalan province, and specific </p><p>updates from the Special Prosecutor\'s office and the </p><p>judiciary on the status of open investigations and labor </p><p>court cases, respectively.  On July 10 we hope to learn of </p><p>additional efforts, and plan to emphasize the need for </p><p>continued sustained efforts on the part of the GOG to protect </p><p>fundamental labor rights. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  By focusing on thematic issues and problems, rather </p><p>than imposing specific benchmarks, we have allowed the GOG </p><p>leeway to establish priorities in addressing the different </p><p>areas where labor rights protections need to be strengthened. </p><p> The creation of an inter-governmental working group, </p><p>suggested by the GOG and modeled on bilateral efforts to </p><p>address counter-narcotics issues, has already borne fruit by </p><p>increasing communication between the diverse GOG institutions </p><p>which have roles to play in labor rights protection.  One </p><p>downside to this approach has been the Labor Minister\'s </p><p>inclination to attempt to use USG interests to advance his </p><p>own agenda.  We have seen this in the case of the Minister\'s </p><p>labor code reform package, which was submitted to Congress </p><p>without adequate consensus-building with civil society; </p><p>unions oppose key elements in this package.  The Minister\'s </p><p>efforts, in tandem with the Minister of Economy, to threaten </p><p>the withdrawal of export privileges from the Choi </p><p>Shin/Cimatextiles plants has also been overplayed by the GOG, </p><p>threatening the loss of the only two unions that exist in the </p><p>for-export maquila sector.  These cases illustrate the need </p><p>for sustained USG engagement with the GOG to improve </p><p>effective labor rights protections in Guatemala. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
