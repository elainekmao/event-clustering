<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003612 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LARGE NUMBERS OF JORDANIANS GO TO THE POLLS; </p><p>ANALYSTS EXPECT PRO-MONARCHY MAJORITY AND SMALL BUT VOCAL </p><p>ISLAMIST MINORITY TO BE ELECTED TO A NEW PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  According to preliminary estimates, between 50 </p><p>and 75 percent of Jordanians eligible to vote went to </p><p>the polls June 17 to elect a new Parliament.  Percentages </p><p>in urban Amman and Irbid seem to be lower.  Voting </p><p>throughout the country was calm, and numerous polling </p><p>stations had a festive air.  Embassy observers report </p><p>that election officials were uniformly serious and </p><p>applied election regulations assiduously around the </p><p>country.  Voting fraud seemed virtually nonexistent: </p><p>EmbOffs observed election and security officials thwart </p><p>several attempts by voters to cast more than one vote </p><p>or vote with altered or improper documents. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Although preliminary results will not be </p><p>available until June 18, most analysts expect the new </p><p>Parliament of 110 seats to have a sizable, pro-monarchy </p><p>majority.  Many observers also expect the Islamic Action </p><p>Front (IAF) to win 20-25 seats which, if combined with </p><p>victories by several independent Islamist candidates, </p><p>will create a small but vocal opposition minority. </p><p>A senior IAF official told the British Ambassador </p><p>June 16 that the IAF will not seek cabinet portfolios </p><p>if a new government is formed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>FESTIVE AIR FOR ELECTIONS; LITTLE VOTER FRAUD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Jordan conducted its first Parliamentary elections </p><p>since 1997 on June 17.  Embassy officers observed the voting </p><p>in numerous urban and rural polling stations around the </p><p>country, including in Amman, Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun, Zarqa, </p><p>Salt, Baqaa refugee camp, Kerak, Tafileh, and Shobak.  All </p><p>officers reported calm and festive polling centers.  Security </p><p>at polling centers was visible, but not intrusive.  Election </p><p>officials in polling places were universally serious about </p><p>their responsibilities and appeared to apply election </p><p>regulations assiduously.  EmbOffs observed election officials </p><p>throughout the country checking national ID cards and </p><p>verifying identities of voters, including those of veiled </p><p>women (who were asked to show their face to either the </p><p>polling station manager or a female police officer).  EmbOffs </p><p>reported that the counting of ballots after the close of </p><p>polls was conducted in the polling centers, with the name </p><p>from each ballot observed by the electoral committee and read </p><p>aloud.  Representatives of candidates were present at each </p><p>ballot box observed, and stayed for the counting of ballots. </p><p>These representatives did not report any problems in polling </p><p>or vote counting.  (EmbOffs in fact observed election and </p><p>security officials thwart several attempts to cast more than </p><p>one vote or vote with altered or improper documents.  The </p><p>perpetrators were politely escorted from polling stations, </p><p>but not taken into custody.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Outside of polling stations, numerous candidate </p><p>representatives passed out literature and tried to convince </p><p>undecided voters how to cast their ballots.  Many candidates </p><p>bussed voters to polling stations, but several voters </p><p>indicated to EmbOffs that they would vote for a candidate </p><p>other than the one who had provided the ride to the polls. </p><p>Although prohibited near polling stations, many candidates </p><p>set up election tents and arranged parades of their </p><p>supporters to and from polling stations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>GOOD TURNOUT IN RURAL AREAS, TOWNS; LESS IN URBAN AREAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Preliminary numbers compiled from individual polling </p><p>places around the country indicate a turnout of between 60 </p><p>and 75 percent in rural areas and small town in the north, </p><p>center, and south.  Outlying Amman suburbs and the Baqaa </p><p>refugee camp saw an estimated 50-60 percent participation </p><p>rate.  Voter turnout in urban Amman and Irbid appears to have </p><p>been lower, with some election officials expressing to </p><p>EmbOffs disappointment over a less than expected turnout. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Jordan television (JTV) and radio carried throughout </p><p>the day live coverage from reporters roving around the </p><p>country, as well as commentary by Jordanian government </p><p>officials and analysts.  The Ambassador appeared on JTV to </p><p>support Jordan\'s democratic process and highlight U.S.-Jordan </p><p>bilateral relations and U.S. resolve to achieve Middle East </p><p>peace.  JTV will carry live coverage of election results </p><p>throughout the night as the votes are tabulated. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>EXPECTED RESULTS: PRO-KING MAJORITY, ISLAMIST MINORITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  While preliminary results will not be available </p><p>until June 18, most analysts expect the elections to produce </p><p>a substantial pro-government majority because distribution </p><p>and weight of districts favor candidates in generally East </p><p>Bank small towns and rural areas.  This majority will likely </p><p>be tribal, conservative, and pro-monarchy in its orientation. </p><p> Analysts also expect the IAF to win between 20-25 seats of </p><p>the 29 they are contesting.  (In fact, PolOff witnessed an </p><p>IAF candidate win the vote count in one Amman polling </p><p>station.)  When coupled with expected victories of several </p><p>independent Islamist candidates, this should produce a small </p><p>but vocal opposition minority in the new Parliament.  A </p><p>senior IAF official told the British Ambassador June 16 that </p><p>the IAF was unlikely to seek any cabinet portfolios if a new </p><p>government is formed after elections. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Although analysts pinpointed 3-4 contests in which </p><p>women candidates ran close races, most did not expect more </p><p>than 1-2 women to win seats outright (many expect women to </p><p>get only the six newly created women\'s seats). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Embassy will report on the results of the elections </p><p>as they become available June 18. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
