BELOW IS THE 2002 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. </p><p>RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A)  CHINA TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER </p><p>EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE </p><p>DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY </p><p>INSTRUCTS ITS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND </p><p>FREEZE ASSETS OF DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  CHINA </p><p>HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS.

THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS DURING THE YEAR OF BOMBINGS IN </p><p>VARIOUS PARTS OF CHINA; IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER </p><p>THESE WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACTS OF TERRORISM OR </p><p>CRIMINAL ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>C,D)  EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS </p><p>FOR EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS TO OR FROM CHINA IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>E)  CHINESE OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS REGULARLY DENOUNCE </p><p>TERRORISM, BOTH IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA.  IF ASKED TO DO SO, WE BELIEVE CHINA </p><p>WOULD GENERALLY COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>F)  CHINA REGULARLY PARTICIPATES IN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM AND JOINED IN STATEMENTS </p><p>DENOUNCING TERRORISM AT THE 2002 APEC MEETING, THE ASEAN </p><p>REGIONAL FORUM, AND THE ASEAN PLUS 3 MEETING.

IT HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE, BUT DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CHINA\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM IN THE PAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>J)  THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA HOLD SEMI-ANNUAL </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS, AS WELL AS EXPERT LEVEL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF TERRORISM. </p><p>CHINA ALSO ATTENDED THE SOUTHEAST ASIA COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>CONFERENCE IN HONOLULU.  AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM A, CHINA </p><p>TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER </p><p>13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE DESIGNATED BY THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY INFORMS ITS FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND FREEZE ASSETS OF </p><p>DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>CHINA ALSO SHARE INFORMATION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, </p><p>INCLUDING THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS, CONCERNING </p><p>PERSONS POSSIBLY INVOLVED WITH TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>CHINA AGREED IN 2002 TO PERMIT THE FBI TO OPEN AN OFFICE </p><p>IN BEIJING.  THAT OFFICE IS NOW OPEN AND WILL HELP </p><p>COORDINATE WITH THE PRC ON TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO ASKED CHINA TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>THE CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI).  DURING HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH IN CRAWFORD, TEXAS, </p><p>PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN ANNOUNCED ACCEPTANCE OF THE CSI. </p><p>DETAILS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>K) N/A </p><p> </p><p>L) N/A </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
