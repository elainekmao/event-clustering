<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002865 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL/AAE-PRAHAR/FLOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: 2002 NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) 02 STATE 190339 </p><p>      B) 02 STATE 124582 </p><p>      C) 01 ABUJA 2983 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This responds to Ref A\'s request for a certification </p><p>report card showing the Government of Nigeria\'s (GON\'s) </p><p>achievements in meeting the certification benchmarks </p><p>contained in Ref B. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Major Traffickers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The USG urged the GON to have the NDLEA Joint Task </p><p>Force (with DEA) focus more effectively on dismantling </p><p>Nigeria-based drug trafficking networks that affect the </p><p>United States.  The GON was asked to produce at least one </p><p>arrest and prosecution of a major drug trafficker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Under the leadership of a skilled and energetic new </p><p>director, the performance of the Joint Task Force (JTF) has </p><p>improved.  However, the JTF has not yet arrested a major </p><p>drug trafficker.  In working closely with the DEA Lagos </p><p>office, it has made significant progress in investigating </p><p>four kingpins whose trafficking operations affect the </p><p>United States.  DEA reports that the cooperation with the </p><p>JTF\'s NDLEA staff is excellent.  A major arrest is </p><p>anticipated soon, according to the DEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Despite severe budgetary constraints (largely the result </p><p>of the National Assembly\'s failure to approve a federal </p><p>budget in FY02), President Obasanjo on October 15 ordered </p><p>the payment of increased federal funds to the NDLEA - 115 </p><p>million naira (roughly USD 1 million) in capital </p><p>expenditures and an estimated 75 million naira (roughly USD </p><p>650,000) in additional recurring operational funds.  This </p><p>is a strong and tangible sign of the Executive\'s commitment </p><p>to drug enforcement efforts, especially in today\'s cash- </p><p>strapped GON budgetary environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Extradition </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to strengthen its extradition </p><p>practice and procedures, including its extradition unit </p><p>within the Ministry of Justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In August 2002 the GON successfully extradited Gabriel </p><p>Umoh, a dual-national convicted in Northern California for </p><p>financial fraud.  An additional extradition case is now </p><p>before the High Court of Lagos and a third case is close to </p><p>being filed in court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Interdiction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to intensify efforts at the </p><p>Lagos airport to ensure direct flights to the United States </p><p>do not become major drug trafficking conduits.  The GON was </p><p>also asked to extend greater control over mail and </p><p>commercial delivery services and to improve use and </p><p>maintenance of INL-furnished "Itemiser" drug detection </p><p>scanners at Lagos\' Murtala Muhammed International Airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The NDLEA unit at Lagos\' Murtala Muhammed International </p><p>Airport (MMIA) continues to conduct 100 percent searches of </p><p>passengers and carry-on baggage boarding direct flights to </p><p>the U.S., as well as random searches of checked baggage for </p><p>flights to Europe and the U.S.  Country-wide year-to-date </p><p>(as of September) seizures of cocaine and heroin are 73.38 </p><p>kg and 16.96 kg, respectively. (Note: Over 60 percent of </p><p>the cocaine seizures and 95 percent of heroin seizures were </p><p>made by the NDLEA unit at Lagos\' airport. End Note) Over </p><p>220 metric tons of cannabis have been seized in the last </p><p>nine months.  2,004 persons have been arrested for drug </p><p>trafficking crimes, mostly for cannabis trafficking </p><p>offenses.  The RNLEO has discussed concerns over the </p><p>apparently under-use of the Itemisers with the NDLEA </p><p>Chairman and the NDLEA Zonal Commander at MMIA.  Both </p><p>officials have pledged to improve operational use of the </p><p>machines, and their pledge will be reinforced by new </p><p>traiing INL will provide in the coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) The USG requested the GON to take necessary steps </p><p>to bring Nigeria into compliance with FATF recommendations, </p><p>specifically through the enactment of new anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation.  The USG also asked that the GON to </p><p>consider expanding its provisions for asset forfeiture, for </p><p>limited use by the Anti-Corruption Commission, NDLEA and </p><p>Police CID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Nigeria was designated a "non-cooperating country or </p><p>territory (NCCT)" by the FATF for the second consecutive </p><p>year in June 2002.  On October 11, 2002 the FATF decided to </p><p>impose "counter-measures" against Nigeria, effective </p><p>December 15, 2002, unless the GON passes necessary changes </p><p>to Nigeria\'s 1995 Money Laundering Act by that date.  The </p><p>President\'s office has pledged to work with the National </p><p>Assembly to make the needed legislative amendments by the </p><p>December 15 deadline.  There are early indications that the </p><p>Nigerian legislature also will cooperate. </p><p>-- The 2000 Anti-Corruption Law has provisions for the </p><p>forfeiture of assets derived from corruption.  The draft </p><p>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Act has similar </p><p>provisions applicable against the laundering of proceeds of </p><p>any criminal felony. </p><p>E. Corruption </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) As a measure of the GON\'s resolve to tackle </p><p>corruption, the USG asked the GON to fund and staff </p><p>adequately the two year-old Independent Corrupt Practices </p><p>and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). </p><p>Additionally, the ICPC should prosecute at least three </p><p>high-level officials on corruption charges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In early 2002, the ICPC received budget allocations </p><p>necessary to fund and train (with some INL assistance) over </p><p>100 new staff members.  In September 2002, verdicts were </p><p>delivered in the first three ICPC cases prosecuted.  These </p><p>involved two Local Government Area (LGA) Chairmen and a </p><p>High Court judge -- all considered senior officials. </p><p>Additional court cases will be concluded in the near </p><p>future.  The ICPC has over 100 cases pending against </p><p>officials at the local, state, and national levels.  ICPC </p><p>staff recently indicated that several Ministers and </p><p>Governors are under serious investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Demand Reduction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to provide adequate funding </p><p>and personnel to implement the demand reduction component </p><p>of Nigeria\'s drug control policy plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The NDLEA has an active demand reduction program, which </p><p>provides awareness and education programs targeting primary </p><p>and secondary schools and all elements of the mass media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. Controlled Delivery </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to cooperate with controlled </p><p>deliveries, as called for in Article II of the 1988 UN </p><p>Convention on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The NDLEA Chairman has stated his commitment to </p><p>cooperate fully with any proposed controlled delivery </p><p>operations initiated by the DEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
