<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, PTER, PINS, CASC, NI, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATED NIGERIA TRIP WIRES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  01 ABUJA 2508 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON: 1.5 (G). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) Abuja and Lagos EACs met separately to examine </p><p>and update tripwires last reported reftel.  The impetus for </p><p>these meetings was rising tensions associated with electoral </p><p>activity in Nigeria and the possibility of U.S. military </p><p>action in Iraq.  This message reports tripwires for both </p><p>Posts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) Background:  Nigeria is more volatile today than </p><p>a year ago.  Ethnic and religious passions are evident.  A </p><p>stagnant economy and high unemployment have created large </p><p>pools of disaffected youth easily persuaded to take to the </p><p>streets in some cities.  Elections into local, state and </p><p>national office by law should take place in early 2003 but </p><p>are yet to be scheduled, adding to the underlying tensions. </p><p>Against this backdrop, eventual U.S. military action in Iraq </p><p>will resonate along regional and religious fault lines here, </p><p>already under stress from economic and electoral pressures. </p><p>Should the U.S. engage militarily in Iraq, significant anti- </p><p>American protests are possible in several cities, including </p><p>Abuja and Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Vulnerabilities: While GON security forces retain </p><p>the same limited capabilities they had a year ago, today </p><p>they face additional challenges.  Violent demonstrations in </p><p>Abuja November 22 related to the Miss World beauty pageant </p><p>ended the aura of immunity from political violence that the </p><p>capital had previously enjoyed.  Moreover, other apparently </p><p>politically-inspired violence, including assassinations, not </p><p>only degrades citizens\' sense of being secure but poses </p><p>risks for democracy.  Should a credible and specific threat </p><p>to their security arise, the Government of Nigeria would </p><p>seek to protect American citizens and USG facilities. </p><p>However, the Mission is less sanguine now than it was a year </p><p>ago that the GON would be able effectively to provide </p><p>security.  Several Nigerian states face political </p><p>instability so serious that it may be difficult to hold </p><p>elections in those states.  The GON must seek to preclude </p><p>any possibility of several, nearly simultaneous outbreaks of </p><p>widespread, deadly political violence in far-flung parts of </p><p>Nigeria.  Responding to that imperative spreads GON forces </p><p>out and creates new vulnerabilities in areas thought to be </p><p>relatively safe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) Different Circumstances:  Trip wires for Abuja </p><p>and Lagos are not identical.  Overall security conditions </p><p>and the capacity of the security forces in each city to </p><p>manage potential security challenges differ.  In a nutshell, </p><p>security conditions and the GON ability to respond are </p><p>better in Abuja than in Lagos, though swift population </p><p>growth in the capital has made it less safe than it was </p><p>previously.  A large demonstration around the Embassy in the </p><p>event of U.S. military action is likely, while the ability </p><p>of the GON security apparatus in Abuja to respond to such an </p><p>eventuality is uncertain.  The events of November 22 showed </p><p>a GON unable to respond effectively to very credible threat </p><p>information.  A week later, a massive security presence </p><p>precluded another violent episode, even though (sources say) </p><p>the number of those intending to demonstrate was larger. </p><p>Meanwhile, the security apparatus in Lagos has been </p><p>traditionally unreliable in the face of serious threats. </p><p>While the threat posed by the Oodua People\'s Congress, the </p><p>largest and most organized group with a sustained history of </p><p>violence against the federal government of Nigeria and the </p><p>Nigerian National Police Force, has receded, the ubiquitous, </p><p>often-violent criminal element in Lagos adds dimensions to </p><p>the challenges that confront Consulate Lagos in ways that </p><p>Embassy Abuja does not have to face. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) Both Abuja and Lagos have taken numerous steps to </p><p>enhance emergency preparedness, including updating the </p><p>Emergency Action Plan (EAP), EAP briefings of all official </p><p>employees and adult family members, as well as similar </p><p>briefings for U.S. firms and private American citizens. The </p><p>Mission also recently conducted a Crisis Management Exercise </p><p>(CME).  Posts have requested and received additional host </p><p>country security support and have enhanced their security </p><p>posture significantly at all official buildings and </p><p>compounds.  Additionally, Lagos has taken all necessary </p><p>steps to ensure that adequate supplies of U.S. dollars are </p><p>on hand and evacuation orders prepared for all Mission </p><p>employees and family members.  Abuja does not have </p><p>sufficient USD, but evacuation orders have been prepared; </p><p>efforts are underway to increase USD cash-on-hand. </p><p>Classified holdings are in the process of being reduced to </p><p>one-hour destruction time, and emergency preparedness drills </p><p>will continue to be conducted at both Posts.  Consular </p><p>officers have visited various cities throughout Nigeria to </p><p>meet wardens and U.S. citizens on the topic of emergency </p><p>preparedness.  Both Posts have in place special security </p><p>directives governing travel by employees to areas of </p><p>particular concern within Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) In consideration of the distinctly different </p><p>security environments of Abuja and Lagos, the respective </p><p>EACs have developed Abuja-specific and Lagos-specific </p><p>tripwires.  Chief of Mission reviewed both sets of trip </p><p>wires December 18 and concurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) One important difference between Abuja and Lagos </p><p>is the Abuja EAC\'s determination that "minimal" staffing is </p><p>not a viable option for the capital.  The Embassy does not </p><p>have a MSG detachment, and its perimeter cannot readily be </p><p>defended.  Should circumstances dictate drawdown below the </p><p>"essential" level (about 40% of normal staffing, septel), </p><p>the EAC would recommend Post closure to the COM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C/NF) Tripwires for Embassy Abuja: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  Any of the following trip wires would trigger an EAC and </p><p>an assessment of the security environment in Nigeria: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There is a significant upsurge in violent crime in Abuja; </p><p>-- There are large or violent anti-U.S. demonstrations in </p><p>any Nigerian city; </p><p>-- There is scattered unrest in Nigeria as the result of a </p><p>political event (party convention or caucuses); </p><p>-- A USG installation anywhere in the world is attacked; </p><p>-- Threats of a non-specific and unverifiable nature against </p><p>American lives or property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  Any of the following tripwires would trigger an EAC and </p><p>consideration of whether to issue a stronger Travel Advisory </p><p>(recommending that non-essential travel be deferred) and </p><p>impose further travel restrictions on USG personnel: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S. commences military operations in the Middle East </p><p>in support of UNSCR 1441; </p><p>-- There are large or violent anti-U.S. demonstrations in </p><p>any Nigerian city with a significant AmCit population; </p><p>-- There is a more severe disruption in delivery of </p><p>petroleum products than heretofore experienced; </p><p>-- There is an effective general strike for any reason; </p><p>-- Threats of a credible nature to American lives or </p><p>property emerge anywhere in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  Any of the following tripwires would result in convening </p><p>the EAC and specific consideration of whether to request a </p><p>travel warning urging that travel to Nigeria be avoided, and </p><p>to recommend that the COM consider authorized departure: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There are large or violent anti-U.S. demonstrations in </p><p>any Nigerian city with American lives or property targeted; </p><p>-- There are riots or unrest in the Abuja satellite towns </p><p>and security forces are unable to restore order quickly; </p><p>-- Inter-ethnic, inter-religious or communal violence breaks </p><p>out in several parts of the country and security forces </p><p>require more than two but less than four days to restore </p><p>order; </p><p>-- Highly credible threats to American lives or property </p><p>emerge anywhere in Nigeria; </p><p>-- Fear and tension in the official American community rise </p><p>to the point that a significant number of community members </p><p>request authorized departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  Any of the following trip wires would result in the </p><p>convening of an EAC to recommend that the COM consider </p><p>ordered departure of dependents and of personnel not </p><p>included on the "essential" list: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Large anti-American demonstrations in the vicinity of </p><p>Embassy Abuja or USAID, and security forces are unable to </p><p>control and disperse the crowds, or violent demonstrators </p><p>target a USG installation in Abuja and cannot be immediately </p><p>deterred by police; </p><p>-- Any USG installation in Nigeria is attacked; </p><p>-- Inter-ethnic, inter-religious or communal violence breaks </p><p>out in several parts of the country and security forces are </p><p>unable to restore order within four days; </p><p>-- Specific, highly credible threats are made to American </p><p>lives or property; </p><p>-- Violent anti-American demonstrations (anywhere in </p><p>Nigeria) result in major damage to American property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C/NF) The tripwires for Consulate General Lagos are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  Any of the following tripwires would trigger an EAC and </p><p>an assessment of the security environment in Lagos and the </p><p>Southern Nigeria Consular District, as well as a tier-one </p><p>test of the warden system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- No clear winners in upcoming elections.  Results openly </p><p>contested.  Assassination of prominent person(s). </p><p>-- Unrest during or after PDP convention. </p><p>-- Significant major natural or man-made disaster. </p><p>-- Access to transportation and telecommunications </p><p>interrupted by strikes of increasing frequency. </p><p>-- Local and state government services paralyzed at some </p><p>levels (i.e. police, electricity, fuel and water </p><p>deliveries). </p><p>-- Governors request that military assure internal security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  Any of the following tripwires would trigger an EAC to </p><p>consider recommending a warning to avoid non-essential </p><p>travel to Nigeria, further restrictions on the movements of </p><p>USG personnel and their dependents, and possible suspension </p><p>of visa operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Credible reporting that situation deteriorating quickly. </p><p>Random sustained violence outside the greater Lagos and </p><p>surrounding area (the regions just beyond the limits of </p><p>Lagos, Ikoyi, and Victoria islands, as well as neighboring </p><p>mainland Lagos areas) increases to the point that the police </p><p>and security forces have difficulty controlling this </p><p>violence. </p><p>-- Instability adversely affects public utilities and </p><p>provokes severe shortages of some essential items. </p><p>Replenishment of basic foodstuffs and water increasingly </p><p>difficult.  Unfettered transport of children to the American </p><p>and British schools no longer assured. </p><p>-- Rising number of Nigerian elite send relatives on </p><p>"vacation" outside Nigeria. </p><p>-- Capital flight increases and oil revenue inflows </p><p>problematical. </p><p>-- Political leaders unable to come to grips with situation </p><p>and show no inclination to compromise. </p><p>-- Shakeup in military hierarchy.  Certain commanders </p><p>relieved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  Any of the following tripwires would trigger an EAC to </p><p>consider requesting a warning to avoid all travel to </p><p>Nigeria, suspension of visa operations, and recommending </p><p>that the COM consider authorized departure for dependents </p><p>and persons not on the "essential" list: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Credible reporting that situation continues to </p><p>deteriorate.  Random violence encroaching on Lagos area; </p><p>police and other security forces unable to control this </p><p>violence. </p><p>-- Instability adversely affecting public utilities; </p><p>shortages of essential items worsening.  Transport to the </p><p>American and British schools no longer reasonably safe. </p><p>-- Rising number of Nigerian elite send relatives on </p><p>"vacation" outside Nigeria. </p><p>-- Large-scale shakeup in military hierarchy.  Commanders of </p><p>critical formations relieved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  Any of the following tripwires would result in the </p><p>convening of an EAC to recommend that the COM consider </p><p>ordered departure of all personnel not on the "essential" </p><p>list and suspension of all but emergency ACS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Substantial and occasionally sustained violence reaches </p><p>areas close to the Lagos islands and cannot be controlled or </p><p>such violence cuts off access to the Lagos airport for more </p><p>than 24 hours.  Police and security forces on the defensive. </p><p>Curfew imposed; military on the streets. </p><p>-- Severe shortages of basic goods and sustained </p><p>interruptions of essential services set in. </p><p>-- Civil disturbances in oil-producing areas endanger </p><p>company operations.  Crude oil deliveries sharply reduced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
