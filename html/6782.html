<p>S E C R E T ROME 001270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: ITALY EXPELS FOUR IRAQI DIPLOMATS AND STAFF </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 75557 </p><p>     B. ROME 1205 </p><p>     C. ROME 1173 </p><p>     D. SECSTATE 72921 </p><p> </p><p>    CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY DCM EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) ON MARCH 25 GOI MFA CONFIRMED TO US DETAILS OF ITS </p><p>EXPULSION OF FOUR IRAQI DIPLOMATS.  TWO (THIRD SECRETARY ALI </p><p>RIFAT AND ATTACHE MOHAMMED HUMADI) HAVE DEPARTED ROME FOR </p><p>AMMAN.  TWO STAFF MEMBERS (TAHER AHMED AND ABDULLAH HUMADI) </p><p>WERE OUT OF ITALY WHEN DECISION WAS MADE AND WILL NOT BE </p><p>ALLOWED IN.  IRAQI INTEREST SECTION REMAINS "OPEN" (THOUGH </p><p>BARELY FUNCTIONING, ACCORDING TO GOI) UNDER DIRECTION OF </p><p>CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES FARES AL SHOKER, WHO WAS NOT EXPELLED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) FM FRATTINI ADDRESSED THE ISSUE AT A MARCH 24 JOINT </p><p>SESSION OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE COMMITTEES OF THE </p><p>SENATE AND THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, CALLED TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>MARCH 20-21 EU COUNCIL MEETING ON IRAQ.  GIVEN THEIR TIMING, </p><p>THE EXPULSIONS BECAME PART OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DISCUSSIONS. </p><p>FRATTINI TOLD THE MP\'S THAT THE GOI\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE FOUR </p><p>EXPELLED IRAQIS "DID NOT BEGIN AS A RESULT OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>REQUESTS, BUT IT CONCLUDED AFTER THESE REQUESTS" ADDING THAT </p><p>"THESE FOUR PERSONS WERE CARRYING OUT ACTIVITIES INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH THEIR DIPLOMATIC STATUS." </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION CITED THE EXPULSIONS TO </p><p>ACCUSE THE GOI OF "SERVILE BEHAVIOR" TOWARD THE U.S., </p><p>CHOOSING (ONCE AGAIN) TO PORTRAY GOI ACTION NOT AS A MATTER </p><p>OF SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION, BUT AS "AN ACT OF </p><p>WAR."  CENTER-LEFT ARGUMENTS RANGED FROM ACCUSATIONS THAT THE </p><p>GOI "LACKED CLARITY" IN ITS IRAQ POLICY TO CALLS FOR </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF "MEASURES TAKEN IN...DECLARED WAR," </p><p>BUT FOCUSED MOST ON ALLEGED GOI "ACCEPTANCE OF U.S. </p><p>    DICTATES."  THE ARGUMENTS WERE EVEN MORE EGREGIOUSLY </p><p>POLITICAL THAN USUAL IN ITALIAN POLITICAL RHETORIC, AS </p><p>WITNESSED BY THE PUBLIC REFUSAL OF FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>AND CURRENT OLIVE TREE COALITION SENATOR LAMBERTO DINI TO </p><p>CONCUR.  DINI AVERRED THAT "EVERY COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO </p><p>EXPEL THOSE DIPLOMATS THAT UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH THEIR DIPLOMATIC STATUS, SUCH AS ESPIONAGE." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT:  THE OPPOSITION\'S RESPONSE TO THE IRAQI </p><p>EXPULSIONS IS PAR FOR THEIR COURSE, IF SOMEWHAT MORE BLATANT </p><p>THAN USUAL.  BEING "AGAINST THE WAR" IS THE ONE ISSUE THAT </p><p>PUTS THE CENTER-LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN PUBLIC -- ALTHOUGH IT IS FAR FROM CLEAR WHO IS </p><p>LEADING, AND WHO IS FOLLOWING, WHOM.  OPPOSITION </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THEY REMAIN OUR </p><p>FRIENDS, AND IN OUR VIEW THEY ARE NOT BEING ENTIRELY </p><p>DISINGENUOUS WHEN THEY SAY SO.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC) AND OTHER FAR-LEFT ELEMENTS, </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS REGULARLY POINT OUT THAT OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>ATTACK ON IRAQ SHOULD NOT BE COUPLED WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM. </p><p>STILL, THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY THE EXPULSIONS </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN JUST TOO EASY -- AND TOO JUICY -- TO </p><p>PASS UP (PRINCIPLES AND ARGUMENTATION ASIDE). </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01270 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
