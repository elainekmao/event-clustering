<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002844 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON RIYADH BOMBINGS, PEACE </p><p>PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, May 15, focuses on </p><p>the aftermath of the suicide attacks in Riyadh. </p><p>Another lead story today focuses on Israeli attacks </p><p>killing 5 Palestinians and demolishing over 25 </p><p>Palestinian homes.  On Iraq-related issues, only Al- </p><p>Rai Arabic and the Jordan Times English dailies </p><p>carried lead stories about the discovery of mass </p><p>graves with thousands of bodies in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-- Coverage of Secretary Powell\'s visit to Jordan in </p><p>yesterday\'s papers, May 14, was overshadowed by </p><p>reports of the bombings in Riyadh.  The signing of the </p><p>$700 million cash transfer between the Secretary and </p><p>Foreign Minister Muasher in Amman received good </p><p>coverage. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The terrorism debate" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (05/15) editorializes:  "Terrorism is </p><p>obviously nurtured by frustration and desperation.  It </p><p>takes political, economic and cultural work to </p><p>eradicate it.  The `cultural cure\' is up to all of us, </p><p>and it mainly hinges on countering the notion that </p><p>violence can be used for the achievement of political </p><p>goals.  It is also necessary to foster a healthy </p><p>dialogue on Islam and its values, with a view to </p><p>emphasize and bring to everyone\'s attention - Muslims </p><p>and others - that Islam is first and foremost about </p><p>the sanctity of life.  Politically, as it has been </p><p>repeated almost ad nauseam, and as it should be </p><p>increasingly obvious, the core problem of the Middle </p><p>East - the Palestinian question - needs to be </p><p>adequately addressed.  The United States went after </p><p>the Taleban and Osama Ben Laden in Afghanistan.  But </p><p>terrorism has not stopped.  The United States went </p><p>after Saddam Hussein in Iraq.  But terrorism has not </p><p>stopped.  Before another war is started, perhaps it </p><p>would be worth to see to a fair and final solution of </p><p>the Arab-Israeli conflict." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Operations that serve the continued foreign </p><p>presence?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, Arabic daily Al-Rai (05/15):  "These </p><p>operations [Riyadh bombings] might be, just as others </p><p>were in the past, a tool for the foreigner to seal his </p><p>control, impose his conditions, and effect the change </p><p>that he wants.  What was attacked in reality involved </p><p>Arab security, Arab interests and the Arab image, </p><p>before targeting a group of Americans.  The </p><p>requirements of achieving a peaceful political </p><p>settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have </p><p>Israel cornered, and its rejection of the roadmap has </p><p>been exposed.  The Riyadh terrorist operations </p><p>happened to rescue Israeli and get it out of the </p><p>dilemma by turning the spotlights away from it and </p><p>relieving it from the demands of international </p><p>pressures.  Now, there is new rising terrorism that </p><p>must be dealt with and fought off, because it is a </p><p>terrorism that hurts Americans..  Those who </p><p>perpetrated the bombings in Riyadh have saved the </p><p>enemies of the Arab cause, justified the foreign </p><p>intervention and the U.S. war against the region." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Saudi Arabia in the storm" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/15):  "Describing the bombings in Saudi Arabia as </p><p>a terrorist action is not enough, because they are </p><p>utter lunacy..  Political terrorism as a means to an </p><p>end is known throughout the history of political </p><p>movements.  Yet, mass suicides in a residential </p><p>complex go beyond the phenomenon of political </p><p>terrorism.  It is a mental disorder." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Killing off the roadmap" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/15) editorializes:  "By stating clearly and </p><p>frankly that no one exercised any pressure on his </p><p>government to accept the roadmap, Israeli Prime </p><p>Minister Sharon divulges a very important part of the </p><p>Collin Powel\'s talks in Israel and puts an end to the </p><p>illusion that some members of the U.S. administration </p><p>promoted regarding Washington\'s seriousness and </p><p>readiness to exercise pressure on the Palestinian and </p><p>Israeli parties to accept and to implement the </p><p>roadmap.  Clearly, American pressures have one side </p><p>and one direction and they have targeted the </p><p>Palestinian party and held it responsible for the </p><p>criminal actions of the victimizer, while the forces </p><p>of aggression and occupation continued to receive </p><p>understanding and sympathy..  The situation of the </p><p>Palestinian-Israeli conflict is nearing a state of </p><p>endless vicious circle.  Israel continues its war of </p><p>siege and extermination for the third year running.. </p><p>More seriously, the United States, the superpower and </p><p>the only country capable of twisting the Hebrew </p><p>State\'s arm, refuses to do that, rather intentionally </p><p>directs its pressures towards the Palestinians and the </p><p>Arab.  The situation being what it is, Arab and </p><p>international efforts must be directed towards </p><p>Washington, which has pledged support for the peace </p><p>process, but in reality is working to impede this </p><p>process with its blind bias in favor of the Hebrew </p><p>State." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Riyadh bombings and the formula of terrorism and </p><p>bias" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/15):  "There are two major facts that must be said </p><p>before writing about the bombings in Riyadh.  The </p><p>first fact is that any act of violence that targets </p><p>civilians of any nationality is a terrorist act that </p><p>is rejected and condemned.  The second fact is that </p><p>the sole reason for these terrorist operations and </p><p>actions in general is the U.S. policy in the Arab </p><p>world.  Thus we write that we condemn terrorist </p><p>actions, that we condemn the killing of innocent </p><p>civilians, and that we denounce American policies, and </p><p>we are not ashamed to say that.  It is hard to shed </p><p>tears at the American victims . because we have seen </p><p>thousands of civilians die in Iraq by American weapons </p><p>and have not seen the Americans overly sensitive or </p><p>emotional.  Washington must understand that its </p><p>aggressive policies, its occupation of Iraq, its </p><p>complete bias in favor of Israel\'s crimes, its desire </p><p>to control the Arab world will not be welcomed with </p><p>the applause and ululations of the millions of people. </p><p>In fact there are those who are so angry and furious </p><p>with the American policies that they are willing to </p><p>confront it with violence."
