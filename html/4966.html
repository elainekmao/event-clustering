Gul reportedly said </p><p>that Iraq must convince the world that it possessed no </p><p>weapons of mass destruction.  President Mubarak has pledged </p><p>to support Turkey\'s peace efforts, and announced that he </p><p>will soon visit Turkey.  Weekend papers report Prime </p><p>Minister Gul\'s visit to Damascus on Saturday.  Gul was </p><p>received by the Syrian head of state, Bashar Assad, who </p><p>reportedly warned the U.S. that an expanded operation </p><p>against Iraq would upset the countries in the region.  Gul </p><p>has eased concern of Arab countries that Turkey wants to </p><p>seize Mosul and Kirkuk, papers report.  The Syrian foreign </p><p>minister is expected in Turkey later this month.  Sunday\'s </p><p>"Milliyet" carries photos of over 30 Turkish tanks in </p><p>Bamerni, Northern Iraq.  Milliyet says that Turkish troops </p><p>have been stationed at three different points inside </p><p>Northern Iraq in order to prevent a wave of refugees and to </p><p>halt terrorist infiltration through the Turkish border.  In </p><p>a front-page exclusive today, Foreign Minister Yakis told </p><p>"Hurriyet" that after feeling the nation\'s pulse on the </p><p>issue, the parliament is unlikely to approve a decision to </p><p>support war against Iraq.  Turkey has asked for a `modus </p><p>operandi\' with the U.S. for site surveys, Yakis said, </p><p>because U.S. plans for upgrading Turkish bases cannot be </p><p>carried out within the framework of NATO.  The U.S. does not </p><p>really want NATO involved in the process, he added, as NATO </p><p>approval would be needed in each new phase of operations </p><p>against Iraq.  Yakis stressed that if disagreement over the </p><p>legal framework of U.S. site surveys is not resolved, the </p><p>government might have to seek parliamentary approval.  He </p><p>reiterated Turkish concerns over the autonomy of Northern </p><p>Iraqi Kurdish groups and the status of the Turkomen.  Mosul </p><p>and Kirkuk belong to the Turkomen, Yakis emphasized, and </p><p>Turkey is against the transfer of these oil-rich towns to a </p><p>single ethnic group.  Ankara is going examining </p><p>international agreements to see whether Turkey still has </p><p>claims regarding Mosul and Kirkuk, he noted.  Ankara has </p><p>given the U.S. the message that dealing with Iraq and the </p><p>Cyprus issue simultaneously is a tough task, Yakis added. </p><p>He said that Turkey has asked for U.S. support regarding </p><p>Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. promises `share\' from Iraq\'s rebuilding: Monday\'s </p><p>"Dunya" quotes a senior U.S. diplomat as saying that, based </p><p>on studies done be leading international investment houses, </p><p>reasonable estimates of Turkey\'s economic losses from a </p><p>possible Iraq war range from $4-15 billion.  Any U.S. </p><p>assistance package for Turkey would be flexible, giving </p><p>Turkey additional funds to draw on if losses increase, the </p><p>U.S. diplomat said.  He added that the U.S. economic support </p><p>package aimed to maintain market confidence in Turkey, </p><p>thereby minimizing the effects of an economic `shock\' from a </p><p>possible Iraq operation.  The diplomat pointed out that </p><p>Turkey would be in a good position to obtain lucrative </p><p>construction contracts in a post-Saddam Iraq.  The diplomat </p><p>cautioned that in the event that Turkey refuses to cooperate </p><p>with the U.S., some negative effects in U.S.-Turkey </p><p>bilateral economic relations would be unavoidable, Dunya </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan/Siirt elections: Papers report uncertainty within </p><p>the AKP regarding Erdogan\'s participation in the March 9 </p><p>Siirt elections.  The AKP is afraid that pro-Kurdish DEHAP </p><p>might form a coalition with the CHP and, together with the </p><p>support from center-right parties, prevent Erdogan from </p><p>being elected in Siirt.  Consequently, the AKP leadership is </p><p>considering having Erdogan run in an election in Gumushane </p><p>province, where their party won 42 percent of the vote on </p><p>November 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Weekend papers report Erdogan as saying that Turkey </p><p>prefers a mutually satisfactory solution for Cyprus rather </p><p>than a one-sided one, and that negotiations should continue </p><p>to solve the `40-year old problem.\'  `We must act sensibly </p><p>for the sake of both peoples on the island,\' Erdogan said. </p><p>Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas, who threatened to resign at </p><p>his meeting with political leaders in northern Cyprus, said </p><p>he is encouraged by positive messages issued by President </p><p>Sezer and Erdogan, according to papers.  President Sezer </p><p>said on Friday that rallies in the Turkish sector displayed </p><p>the democratic structure of the regime, and that Denktas was </p><p>being constructive when he said that the UN plan was </p><p>negotiable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Public Procurement Law: Papers report that the government is </p><p>working for changes to the public procurement law, which </p><p>took effect on January 1.  In the new draft, the ban on </p><p>municipal tenders is removed.  Contractors will be allowed </p><p>to use machinery owned by the state in the construction of </p><p>new motorways.  Papers express concern that the suggested </p><p>changes would weaken the law and serve as a blow to Turkey\'s </p><p>efforts to reach EU standards. </p><p>U.S. gives the PKK money: Workers\' Party (IP) Chairman Dogu </p><p>Perincek claimed that the U.S. has given $125 million to the </p><p>PKK, "Cumhuriyet" reports.  Basing his accusation on Russian </p><p>sources and information provided by Serbian Socialist Party </p><p>leader Pavkovic, Perincek charged that the U.S. gave the PKK </p><p>$125,3 million of the total $500 million reserved for </p><p>organizations in Northern Iraq on December 27, 2002.  $200 </p><p>million went to Barzani\'s KDP, and $175 million to </p><p>Talabani\'s PUK, Perincek said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey toughens its stance on US demands" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (1/5): "AKP </p><p>figures, particularly party leader Tayyip Erdogan, initially </p><p>gave encouraging remarks to US officials about Turkey\'s </p><p>military cooperation with the US in the event of a military </p><p>operation.  The US administration was convinced that the AKP </p><p>government in Turkey would support its plan for toppling </p><p>Saddam Hussein. . Well, that was the picture in December. </p><p>Turkey has changed its stance over the past month.  The </p><p>concrete steps mentioned by Wolfowitz during his visit to </p><p>Ankara in early December have not yet been undertaken. . For </p><p>instance, Turkey and the US are in serious disagreement </p><p>about the legal status of the site survey teams.  The delay </p><p>in the site survey program and on other issues certainly </p><p>have a delaying effect on US military planning, which </p><p>originally targeted an operation against Iraq in late </p><p>February. .  It is not only technical details which delay </p><p>the process. The fact of the matter is that the AKP </p><p>government is increasingly facing political problems within </p><p>the party.  The AKP grassroots and AKP deputies are not </p><p>willing to support a US military operation against Iraq, and </p><p>the government is unlikely to ensure parliamentary support </p><p>for cooperation with the US.   Public reservation about the </p><p>war is also forcing the government to slow down its support </p><p>for the US.  It is also very likely that the US </p><p>administration feels unhappy about the current diplomatic </p><p>initiative taken by PM Gul in the Middle East.  . The </p><p>possibility of opening a military front in the north against </p><p>Iraq is declining. The US will have problems in securing </p><p>Turkish support on the airbases as well, because the </p><p>government has tied such a decision to a second UNSC </p><p>resolution.  Given these facts, US military strategists </p><p>might ultimately decide to plan on using only a single front </p><p>in Southern Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
