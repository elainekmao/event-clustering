<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000764 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS - BURMESE GOVERNMENT CENSORS </p><p>U.S. PERIODICALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Burmese government is now censoring or controlling </p><p>distribution of some foreign periodicals that are normally </p><p>sold with official authorization in Burma.  This is an effort </p><p>to remove international reports of the May 30 attack on the </p><p>National League for Democracy (NLD) convoy in Depeyin and </p><p>subsequent detainment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the leadership </p><p>of the NLD. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) TIME and NEWSWEEK, which are distributed by a local </p><p>bookstore, were censored by the Burmese Press Scrutiny Board </p><p>to eliminate any such reports.  We have attempted to locate </p><p>and buy the June 16 and June 23 issues of TIME, with no </p><p>success (Note: the June 16 issue of TIME featured a photo of </p><p>some of the bloody clothing and weapons that Embassy officers </p><p>recovered at the site of the May 30 attack. End Note.). The </p><p>June 16 issue of NEWSWEEK is available -  minus pages 15-18 </p><p>containing the article "The Missing Lady", written by Joe </p><p>Cochrane (although the magazine\'s Table of Contents lists the </p><p>article beside a picture of Aung San Suu Kyi).  Other popular </p><p>foreign periodicals, such as the English language editions of </p><p>the major Thai dailies, the "Bangkok Nation" and the "Bangkok </p><p>Post", continue to be sold uncensored (although several days </p><p>old) on the streets of Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) These foreign publications, together with </p><p>international broadcasters such as VOA, RFA and BBC, are a </p><p>vital source of information for Burmese, who cannot read </p><p>reliable reports in the vernacular press.  The only reporting </p><p>on the events of May 30 they have seen in the </p><p>government-controlled press have been articles blaming any </p><p>"unrest" on the actions of the NLD and repeating the </p><p>government\'s dubious numbers of death and casualties. </p><p> </p><p>4) (U) The Embassy American Center makes uncensored versions </p><p>of major international periodicals such as TIME, NEWSWEEK, </p><p>International Herald Tribune, and many others, available to </p><p>the public six days a week. Burmese journalists and others </p><p>continue to keep abreast of events inside their country by </p><p>reading these foreign media at the American Center.  In </p><p>recent weeks, the American Center Library has been even more </p><p>crowded than usual, particularly with students whose </p><p>universities were shut following the May 30 ambush. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
