<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 001505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); T FOR U/S BOLTON </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO U/S BOLTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, IZ, VT, VTPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: WAR IN IRAQ:  POPE SEEKS QUICK END TO CONFLICT, </p><p>CENTRAL ROLE FOR UN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>1.  SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN IRAQ, POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS </p><p>MADE PERSISTENT APPEALS FOR PEACE IN IRAQ AND EXPRESSED </p><p>CONTINUED CONCERN FOR CIVILIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES CAUGHT UP IN THE FIGHTING.  HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO MANY </p><p>MEDIA REPORTS, NEITHER THE POPE NOR SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>IN A POSITION TO SPEAK AUTHORITATIVELY FOR THE HOLY SEE HAVE </p><p>EXPLICITLY CONDEMNED THE WAR IN IRAQ AS IMMORAL OR ILLEGAL. </p><p>THE POPE AND SENIOR HOLY SEE OFFICIALS WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>SPEAK OUT IN FAVOR OF PEACE UNTIL THE WAR ENDS, AND WILL </p><p>LIKELY SUPPORT A CENTRAL ROLE FOR THE UN IN THE POST-WAR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION AND GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ AS A MEANS TO RESTORE </p><p>"THE RULE OF LAW" IN INTERNATIONAL LIFE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>OPPOSED TO IRAQ AND WAR AS MEANS OF RESOLVING PROBLEMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE VATICAN\'S INITIAL REACTION AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF WAR </p><p>WAS BALANCED, REGRETTING THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO </p><p>COMPLY WITH THE UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND THE ABANDONMENT OF THE </p><p>INSPECTION PROCESS.  AS VATICAN SPOKESMAN NAVARRO-VALLS </p><p>STATED MARCH 20, "THE HOLY SEE HAS LEARNED WITH DEEP PAIN OF </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATEST EVENTS IN IRAQ. ON THE ONE </p><p>HAND, IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DID </p><p>NOT ACCEPT THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE </p><p>APPEAL OF THE POPE HIMSELF, AS BOTH ASKED THAT THE COUNTRY </p><p>DISARM. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS TO BE DEPLORED THAT THE </p><p>PATH OF NEGOTIATIONS, ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, FOR A </p><p>PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE IRAQI DRAMA HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED. </p><p>A FEW DAYS LATER, HE ELABORATED THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION </p><p>OBSERVING: "WHEN WAR, AS IN THESE DAYS IN IRAQ, THREATENS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>THE FATE OF HUMANITY, IT IS EVEN MORE URGENT TO PROCLAIM </p><p>WITH A DETERMINED VOICE, THAT PEACE ALONE IS THE WAY TO </p><p>CONSTRUCT A MORE JUST AND UNITED SOCIETY . . . VIOLENCE AND </p><p>ARMS CAN NEVER RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF MEN." </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOR HIS PART, THE POPE HAS FOCUSED MOST OF HIS PUBLIC </p><p>MESSAGES ON PRAYER FOR AN EARLY END TO THE WAR AND CALLS FOR </p><p>ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE WAR\'S OUTBREAK, </p><p>THE POPE SAID, "RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALL ASKED TO WORK AND PRAY </p><p>SO THAT WAR DISAPPEARS FROM THE HORIZON OF HUMANITY."  MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, ON APRIL 6, HE SAID: "GOD WILLING, MAY THIS </p><p>CONFLICT END SOON AND OPEN THE WAY TO A NEW ERA OF </p><p>FORGIVENESS, LOVE AND PEACE, " ADDING, "MY THOUGHTS TURN, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, TO IRAQ AND TO ALL WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE WAR </p><p>THAT RAGES THERE.  I THINK ESPECIALLY OF THE UNARMED </p><p>CIVILIAN POPULATION THAT IS SUBJECTED TO A HARSH TEST IN </p><p>VARIOUS CITIES." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>PUSH FOR FORCE OF LAW OVER LAW OF FORCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  BEYOND THE VATICAN\'S FOCUS ON AN EARLY END TO THE WAR </p><p>AND A CONCERN FOR THE HUMAN SUFFERING, THE VATICAN HAS ALSO </p><p>BEEN ADVOCATING A RENEWED FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND A RESTORATION OF THE CENTRALITY OF THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS AS THE MEANS TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFLICTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN LOUIS TAURAN </p><p>IN A MARCH 26 INTERVIEW WITH AN ITALIAN CATHOLIC WEEKLY </p><p>ASSERTED: "IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO RECALL THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>LETTING THE FORCE OF LAW PREVAIL OVER THE LAW OF FORCE. </p><p>THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT SADDEN ME. FIRST, ABOVE ALL, </p><p>DISRESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW.  WE HAVE A JURIDICAL </p><p>PATRIMONY THAT IS PARTICULARLY COMPLETE AND REFINED.  WE </p><p>HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AMONG PEOPLES </p><p>IN A PEACEFUL WAY.  I ASK MYSELF IF ALL THE RESOURCES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW WERE USED.  THE SECOND THING THAT SADDENS </p><p>ME IS TO SEE THE INABILITY OF MAN TO DRAW LESSONS FROM </p><p>RECENT HISTORY.  TO HAVE WEAKENED THE UNITED NATIONS IS A </p><p>VERY SERIOUS THING. IT IS THE ONLY MEANS WE HAVE FOR </p><p>REGULATED THE LIFE OF NATIONS.  IF WE DO NOT FIND A BETTER </p><p>WAY, THEN WE NEED TO PROTECT THIS MEANS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE VATICAN\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE UN, ARCHBISHOP </p><p>CELESTINO MIGLIORE REINFORCED THIS CONCERN APRIL 1 WHEN HE </p><p>STATED AT THE OPENING OF THE COMMITTEE ON DISARMAMENTS </p><p>SESSION IN NEW YORK: "THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN FINDS ITSELF </p><p>LISTENING TO THE MOUNTING RUMBLE OF ARMS.  WE ARE CONFRONTED </p><p>BY TWO OPPOSING PERSPECTIVES: THE FIRST IS BASED ON THE </p><p>CONVICTION THAT CONFLICTS CAN BE RESOLVED THROUGH A </p><p>DETERMINED AND BROAD-BASED WILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IN LIGHT OF THE WAYS AND WISDOM OF THE LAW; THE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8652 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01505  02 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  DHS-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TEST-00  T-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /001W </p><p>                  ------------------52B8CF  090534Z /38 </p><p>O 090531Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE COLLECTIVE </p><p>MERCOSUR COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); T FOR U/S BOLTON </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO U/S BOLTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: WAR IN IRAQ:  POPE SEEKS QUICK END TO CONFLICT, </p><p>CENTRAL ROLE FOR UN </p><p> </p><p>SECOND PERSPECTIVE MAINTAINS THAT, IN THE FACE OF ELUSIVE </p><p>AND RE-EMERGING THREATS, FORCE IS MORE EFFICACIOUS AND </p><p>DIRECT.  HOWEVER, THE LATTER APPEARS TO ONLY REDUCE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN DISARMAMENT RATHER THAN ENHANCE </p><p>IT, INDUCING NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON MULTILATERALISM.  A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01505  02 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>CLEAR MESSAGE IN FAVOR OF THE FORCE OF LAW AND NOT THE LAW </p><p>OF FORCE SHOULD EMERGE FROM THIS SUBSTANTIVE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>CONCERN FOR \'CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS" AND TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FINAL CONSISTENT PREOCCUPATION OF THE HOLY SEE IN </p><p>THE AFTERMATH OF HOSTILITIES HAS BEEN TO AVOID PERCEPTIONS </p><p>IN THE MUSLIM WORLD OF A "CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS" BETWEEN </p><p>CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM, THE WEST AND THE ARAB WORLD.  THEY </p><p>FEAR THAT SUCH PERCEPTIONS, IN TAURAN\'S WORDS, "WILL </p><p>GENERATE EVERY EXTREMISM POSSIBLE, INCLUDING THAT OF ISLAM. </p><p>WE ALL NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS.  IT WILL CAUSE TERRORISM. </p><p>AND INFLICT A HUGE WOUND TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN </p><p>CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM, BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD THERE\'S THE TENDENCY TO IDENTIFY THE WEST WITH </p><p>CHRISTIANITY."   NAVARRO-VALLS ADDED HIS QUESTIONING TO </p><p>TAURAN\'S CONCERNS ASKING RHETORICALLY APRIL 2: "THE INCREASE </p><p>OF THE NUMBER OF DEATH OF BOTH SIDES POSES A GRAVE MORAL </p><p>QUESTION.  WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF DEAD ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES, ALONG WITH THE SUFFERING, DESTRUCTION AND HATE, </p><p>WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PEACEFUL MEANS TO RENDER HARMLESS THE </p><p>THREAT POSED BY IRAQ?" </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALTHOUGH JOURNALISTS AND COMMENTATORS HAVE ATTRIBUTED </p><p>ALL MANNER OF POSITIONS ON THE WAR IN IRAQ TO THE POPE, THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01505  02 OF 02  090534Z </p><p>HOLY SEE, AND THE VATICAN, THE POPE AND OFFICIALS AUTHORIZED </p><p>TO SPEAK DURING THIS PERIOD HAVE NEVER CONDEMNED THE WAR AS </p><p>IMMORAL.  THOUGH ITS LEGALITY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED PUBLICLY, </p><p>THE POPE HIMSELF HAS NOT SUGGESTED THE WAR IS ILLEGAL. </p><p>INDEED, AS SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE NOTED, THE VATICAN DURING </p><p>THE KOSOVO CAMPAIGN WAS ACTIVELY TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION, SO THEY WILL PROBABLY AVOID CLEAR- </p><p>CUT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR.  IN GENERAL, </p><p>SINCE THE FINAL WEEK BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR, THE VATICAN </p><p>HAS EXERCISED GREATER DISCIPLINE IN PUTTING OUT ITS MESSAGE </p><p>THAN PRIOR TO THE WAR.  WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF SEMI-OFFICIAL VATICAN SOURCES SUCH AS THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S NEWSPAPER, OSSERVATORE ROMANO AND VATICAN RADIO -- </p><p>WHICH CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN OUTLET FOR STILL STRONG ANTI- </p><p>WAR SENTIMENTS.  AS THE STORY SHIFTS TO HUMANITARIAN RELIEF </p><p>AND INTERNAL REFORM, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE COMMON GROUND TO BUILD A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01505 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
