<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>1.  Under headline "Bush putting up a faade" the July 10 </p><p>edition of the independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" </p><p>carried the following opinion piece by Taungana Ndoro under </p><p>his regular column "Inside Politics" on page 13, in which </p><p>he bemoans the exclusion of Zimbabwe from President Bush\'s </p><p>itinerary in Africa.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>". . .It\'s folly for Bush to think that he can solve </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s problems via South Africa.  President Thabo </p><p>Mbeki\'s position on that one is very clear - leave </p><p>Zimbabweans to solve their own problems, period!  The only </p><p>logical thing for Bush to harangue about is Mugabe\'s asylum </p><p>in South Africa.  Mbeki should simply be persuaded to offer </p><p>Mugabe asylum just as Nigeria\'s Olusegun Obasanjo offered </p><p>Charles Taylor of Liberia.  If Bush\'s visit to Africa was </p><p>really in earnest, he would have been in Harare today </p><p>urging talks between the ruling ZANU PF and the opposition </p><p>MDC.  Zimbabwe is drowning in economic debris and all Bush </p><p>can do to help is watch from a distance and try and push </p><p>Mbeki to the forefront of maneuvering an amicable </p><p>settlement for the beleaguered Zimbabweans.  The problem is </p><p>that there is nothing at stake for the Americans in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe is not Iraq.  It does not have oil. . </p><p>.There is therefore, not a chance in hell for Zimbabwe to </p><p>tempt the Americans\' insatiable taste for oil.  We do not </p><p>have weapons of mass destruction either. . .Americans will </p><p>be Americans.  If their interests are not threatened, then </p><p>they have no interest in whatever venture - not even the </p><p>Zimbabwe crisis. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
