<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, PTER, AORC, ASEC, PHUM, NP, WFP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: LOOTING LEADS TO SUSPENSION OF WFP POVERTY </p><p>PROGRAM IN REMOTE DISTRICTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 717 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  A joint German-WFP food aid program has </p><p>been suspended in two districts in western Nepal after </p><p>rice supplies were stolen by suspected Maoist insurgents. </p><p>A press release announcing the suspension was intended to </p><p>put the Maoists on notice that food aid would be cut off </p><p>if such incidents continued, its authors said.  WFP has </p><p>adopted a "zero tolerance" approach and will not resume </p><p>deliveries until they are assured supply lines are safe </p><p>and secure.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Poverty Program On Hold After WFP Rice Stolen </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) WFP and the German development organ GTZ suspended </p><p>a poverty alleviation program in two remote districts of </p><p>Nepal after rice supplies in those areas were looted, the </p><p>two organizations revealed in a joint April 24 press </p><p>release.  On April 7, unknown individuals raided a </p><p>warehouse serving the northwestern Mugu region, detained </p><p>staff there, and made off with rice and cooking oil </p><p>(Reftel).  Then on April 9, bandits stole another 100 </p><p>metric tons of rice from a storage facility in Jajarkot </p><p>district.  Authorities have not determined the identity of </p><p>the robbers, but prime suspects include the Maoist </p><p>insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>Message to Maoists: Cut It Out </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The WFP Country Director for Nepal told us that </p><p>the April 24 press release was an attempt to send the </p><p>Maoists a message through the media:  WFP and its </p><p>implementing partners will suspend operations if they are </p><p>unable to deliver food aid safely and effectively to where </p><p>it is needed.  Moreover, WFP does not want to appear to be </p><p>negotiating with the Maoists.  By shutting down, they put </p><p>the ball in the Maoists\' court, the Director added. </p><p>[Note:  Press reports commented that GTZ and WFP also </p><p>sought to send a message to the government about the </p><p>seriousness of the issue.  End Note.]  WFP said it hoped </p><p>to inspire a more effective community response by raising </p><p>awareness of the consequences of the criminal activities. </p><p> </p><p>GTZ: Cancellation a "Warning Signal" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GTZ Director told Poloff that canceling the </p><p>project in the two districts had only been done as a last </p><p>resort.  He agreed with his WFP counterpart that the </p><p>intention of the press release had been to warn that the </p><p>operation was jeopardized by such activity and to try to </p><p>create public pressure on the Maoists.  GTZ expressed a </p><p>reservation, however, in that the conflict could already </p><p>have reached a level that made it difficult to pressure </p><p>the miscreants effectively.  GTZ remained concerned about </p><p>the deteriorating situation and the recent escalation of </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p>"Zero Tolerance" for Interference </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) For the past year WFP has had a "zero tolerance" </p><p>policy regarding interference in their operations, its </p><p>director related.  Last summer, five percent of the food </p><p>stored by WFP in a facility in Dailekh district was </p><p>confiscated by Maoists.  WFP shut down the project, and </p><p>only restarted it after they received compensation for the </p><p>lost rations.  They hope to get the Maoists\' attention by </p><p>shutting down in Mugu and Jajarkot, and insisting that </p><p>safe and secure supply lines be guaranteed.  In the past </p><p>WFP had believed that the food was so valuable - and the </p><p>areas so difficult to work in - that it was understood </p><p>their supply lines would be respected. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) This incident underlines the negative effect the </p><p>Maoist insurgency has had on programs that benefit the </p><p>poorest Nepalese.  Approximately half of Nepalese children </p><p>are already malnourished; without effective programs in </p><p>place, a further deterioration of that and other human </p><p>development indicators is a certainty.  WFP and GTZ have </p><p>decided to play hardball with the Maoists, betting that </p><p>the Maoists would clear the way for food aid rather than </p><p>watch their people starve.  By their recent actions, </p><p>however, the Maoists have shown little regard for the </p><p>lives of Nepal\'s people. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
