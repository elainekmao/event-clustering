<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME RELEASES SALAI TUN THAN, 20 OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  In a May 4 press release, the State Peace and </p><p>Development Council (SPDC) announced the release of 21 </p><p>political prisoners.  Dr. Salai Tun Than, a well-respected </p><p>academic who was arrested for staging a one-man political </p><p>demonstration in 2001 was among those released.  Salai Tun </p><p>Than is an alumni of the University of Georgia and, as a </p><p>result, has been of particular Congressional and Embassy </p><p>interest since his arrest.  In fact, COM Martinez raised </p><p>Salai Tun Than\'s case directly with the third-ranking general </p><p>in the regime, Secretary One General Khin Nyunt, in a meeting </p><p>on April 27.  This appears to be what triggered his release. </p><p>Poloff met with Salai Tun Than and two of his daughters </p><p>(including Yuzana, with whom Poloff has met previously) on </p><p>May 5 and found him tired but well and extremely happy to be </p><p>out of prison.  Salai Tun Than said authorities made a </p><p>special point of telling him that his release was not the </p><p>result of any external pressure.  He told Poloff, however, </p><p>that in his opinion prisoner releases would only occur as a </p><p>direct result of pressure. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The professor also reported that he had been required </p><p>to sign a "Section 401" agreement, which obligated him to </p><p>serve the remaining balance of his sentence if he is taken </p><p>into custody again.  He said he was a little nervous about </p><p>how the authorities might react to a  meeting with Poloff but </p><p>he was taking the chance because he has had contacts with the </p><p>Embassy in the past.  He said he plans to return to his </p><p>earlier activities as much as possible (advocating </p><p>agricultural reforms for Chin farmers), hoping that if he is </p><p>"transparent" in his activities, authorities will have no </p><p>grounds to rearrest him. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Regarding his recent hunger strike, Dr. Tun Than said </p><p>prison authorities quickly acceded to most of his demands (no </p><p>hoods on political prisoners, permission to possess a Bible, </p><p>a clock in the ward of political prisoners at the prison </p><p>hospital) so he called off the strike after just two days. </p><p>He said just prior to the hunger strike on April 27, prison </p><p>authorities had begun questioning him about the activities he </p><p>might undertake if he were released.  The professor now </p><p>realizes that authorities were already considering whether to </p><p>release him at that time.  He said he told the authorities he </p><p>planned to thank the NLD\'s Aung San Suu Kyi for her party\'s </p><p>support for his family during his incarceration.  The </p><p>authorities told him this was not a wise thing and he said he </p><p>agreed that he would not do it if he were a "normal" citizen, </p><p>but he had a special situation and would want to pay his </p><p>respects.  He said the authorities finally relented when he </p><p>invited them along to visit the NLD, but cautioned him to not </p><p>discuss politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Among the other political prisoners released, there </p><p>were 12 NLD members, including two who are well-known in the </p><p>organization.  Win Thein was a young student who provided </p><p>security for Aung San Suu Kyi in the early days of the party. </p><p> He was arrested in 1989 and is now 36 years old.  Ms. Kyi </p><p>Kyi Win is an NLD member from a Rangoon suburb who has been </p><p>jailed since 1998 because of activism on behalf of the party </p><p>in all parts of the country.  NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo told </p><p>Poloff, "she used to give Military Intelligence fits!"  The </p><p>NLD was pleased to have the releases but noted that there are </p><p>many more cases of old, and infirm political prisoners, many </p><p>of whom have been in prison well past their original </p><p>sentences. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
