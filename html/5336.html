<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000113 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL MARKETS "WAIT AND SEE" ON GOVERNMENT </p><p>POLICY AND IRAQ: BETTING ON U.S. AID </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 628 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Leading Istanbul bankers and market </p><p>analysts see current market sentiment as one of "watchful </p><p>waiting," but believe that despite recent declines in the </p><p>stock market, there is an underlying expectation that the </p><p>Turkish government will reach agreement with the IMF on the </p><p>fourth review and with the U.S. on Iraq modalities.  Analysts </p><p>concede that AK\'s "learning curve has been expensive," and </p><p>that the new government\'s economic policies remain Turkey\'s </p><p>biggest risk (especially on bank sector reform), but they are </p><p>betting at the end of the day on international recognition of </p><p>Turkey\'s interests. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Complacency and Watchful Waiting: In a round of </p><p>separate meetings on January 22 and 23 with visiting Ankara </p><p>DCM and Deputy Econ Counselor, financial and market analysts </p><p>predicted that AK would "stick with the program" and not </p><p>permit relations with either the IMF or United States to </p><p>reach an impasse.  Citibank Country Risk Manager Peter </p><p>Rossiter characterized the markets as complacent, and himself </p><p>offered a relatively sanguine view of the government, arguing </p><p>that it is not "intentionally" departing from the ongoing </p><p>reform program, but instead has been hampered by its </p><p>inexperience and lack of depth in its economic team.  He </p><p>conceded that the government\'s lack of fiscal discipline is a </p><p>serious concern, and that Citibank remains concerned about </p><p>how Turkey will "bridge the gaps" that may occur as a result </p><p>of an Iraq operation and its own fiscal policies, but noted </p><p>that the bank\'s customers do not appear to share these </p><p>worries.  "The moral hazard of potential U.S. assistance is </p><p>serious," he noted.  More generally, however, he saw </p><p>fundamentals in Turkey moving in a positive direction, saying </p><p>that Citibank\'s overall perspective is more positive than a </p><p>year ago as a result of enhanced political stability, a </p><p>stabilized banking system and companies that are "earning </p><p>their way out of the 2001 crisis." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Getting in on the Game: Pointing to the Treasury\'s </p><p>successful January 22 auction, observers also drew attention </p><p>to the reappearance of foreign investors in the market. </p><p>While conceding that the core of the market remains the key </p><p>banks that cannot afford to exit (given that T-bills make up </p><p>35-40 percent of their assets), Bender analysts Murat Gulkan </p><p>and Emin Ozturk attributed foreign demand to the success of </p><p>last year\'s carry trade, where investors realized a 65-70 </p><p>percent return based on a relatively stable exchange rate. </p><p>Morgan Stanley, they noted, had recently put out a paper on </p><p>this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Difficult Relations: While conceding that the agenda </p><p>for completion of the much-delayed fourth review remains </p><p>daunting, analysts were virtually unanimous that the market </p><p>anticipates resolution of the outstanding issues.  Even </p><p>Global\'s Cem Akyurek, traditionally a sceptic about the </p><p>government, expects its completion, while analysts at TEB </p><p>investment argue that the government has "no choice" but to </p><p>reach a settlement.  Disbank\'s Tayfun Bayazit expects a </p><p>satisfactory budget and abandonment of the most controversial </p><p>proposed procurement law amendments, but sees the oustanding </p><p>Pamukbank/Yapi Kredi problem as the key imponderable </p><p>(reftel).  Beyond the January 31 deadline facing the banking </p><p>board on that issue, all pointed to other key milestones </p><p>including submission of the budget in late January. </p><p>Observers agreed that the market expects the IMF to return by </p><p>mid-February, and while some slippage may be allowed because </p><p>of the upcoming holiday (the entire week of February 10), any </p><p>delay beyond that point will damage market confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Moral Hazard: Other banking and market analysts </p><p>shared Citibank\'s belief that the expectation of U.S. </p><p>assistance has created a moral hazard to one degree or </p><p>another, and is encouraging the markets to look beyond such </p><p>key issues as the sustainability of real interest rates. </p><p>There was a general consensus from our interlocutors that the </p><p>markets believe that the U.S. and IMF will take a more </p><p>charitable view of Turkey\'s actions in the event of an Iraq </p><p>operation.  We reiterated to all interlocutors that any U.S. </p><p>assistance is conditioned not just on military cooperation </p><p>but on continued economic reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: If markets are sanguine about the immediate </p><p>future, there remains an underlying pessimism about Turkey\'s </p><p>long-term prospects.  Akyurek, who has headed Global\'s </p><p>research department for five years, argued that essentially </p><p>"AK doesn\'t understand the Washington consensus" and remains </p><p>Turkey\'s biggest risk.  The fact is especially frustrating, </p><p>he argued, because Turkey "doesn\'t need a lot for takeoff-- </p><p>1-2 billion in FDI and 3-4 billion in loans would suffice." </p><p>But for that to occur, Turkey needs 3 good years of "flawless </p><p>economic management."  In his view, and in that of most of </p><p>those we talked to, while Turkey may get through the next few </p><p>months, it is very unlikely to get to that take-off point. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
