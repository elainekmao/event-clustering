(C) ANGELO AND A TEAM OF UN OFFICIALS KICKED OFF THE </p><p>MEETING WITH DUTCH, GERMAN, DFID, SWEDE, NORWEGIAN, </p><p>JAPANESE, FRENCH, DANISH, AND U.S. REPRESENTATIVES BY </p><p>REVIEWING THE FOOD CRISIS.  ANGELO CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>SITUATION AS "EXTREMELY DIFFICULT" DUE TO WHAT HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS THE GOZ POSITION.  HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>WORKING-LEVEL OFFICIALS IN RELEVANT LINE MINISTRIES </p><p>UNDERSTAND THERE IS A DIFFICULT "HUMANITARIAN" SITUATION </p><p>AHEAD AND HAVE AGREED IN PRINCIPLE ON A DOCUMENT AND A </p><p>DRAFT LETTER TO THE UN REQUESTING EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE </p><p>GREEN LIGHT FROM THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, WHICH THEY CLAIM </p><p>IS UNWILLING TO TALK OF HUMANITARIAN NEED FOR </p><p>"POLITICAL" REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE GRAIN MARKETING </p><p>BOARD (GMB) AND STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE (SGR) INDICATE </p><p>THAT SHORTAGES LIE AHEAD.  ANGELO SAID THAT GMB HAS ONLY </p><p>87 METRIC TONS OF WHEAT ON HAND, WITH THE REMAINDER </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 40,500 MT) IN PRIVATE HANDS.  ANGELO </p><p>ESTIMATED THIS AS ABOUT SIX WEEKS OF SUPPLY.  MAIZE IS </p><p>SIMILARLY PROBLEMATIC, SINCE BOTH SMALL HOLDERS AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE HOLDING BACK THEIR STOCKS FROM </p><p>THE MARKET.  (THIS COULD BE A WHOLLY WISE BUSINESS </p><p>DECISION IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION OF RAMPANT </p><p>INFLATION WHERE COMMODITIES ARE WORTH MORE THAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02480  01 OF 03  221422Z </p><p>DEPRECIATING CASH.)  THE GMB HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>PURCHASE 32,000 MT TO DATE.  SGR STOCKS ARE BEING DRAWN </p><p>DOWN AND WITH MARKET PRICES INCREASING, THE SGR IS </p><p>PROBABLY SHOWING A PROFIT ON PAPER, BUT IN HIGHLY </p><p>OVERVALUED CURRENCY.  THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM IS THE </p><p>GMB\'S OFFERING PRICE OF ZIMBABWE DOLLAR (ZD) 7,500/MT, </p><p>FAR BELOW THE ZD 12,000/MT OFFERED BY PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>BUYERS BEFORE THE GMB TOOK MONOPOLISTIC CONTROL OF THE </p><p>MARKET AND PROBABLY LESS THAN PRODUCER COST. (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS TOO REFLECTS THE MARKET AT WORK OUTSIDE THE </p><p>PARASTATAL GRAIN BOARDS, AND FURTHER SHOWS THE </p><p>INCREASING SCARCITY OF MAIZE AND WHEAT AND THE STEEP </p><p>DECLINE OF THE ZD.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SUB) TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS, THE GMB HAS ZD </p><p>1.3 BILLION BUDGETED FOR THE PURCHASING CAMPAIGN; ZD 6 </p><p>BILLION IS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE ENTIRE CROP.  THE </p><p>GMB NOW HOLDS 258,000 MT OF MAIZE, WITH ANOTHER 60,000 </p><p>MT IN PRIVATE HANDS, A SUPPLY THAT COULD BE STRETCHED TO </p><p>MEET FOUR MONTHS OF CONSUMPTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THERE ARE ADDITIONAL, LONGER-TERM CONCERNS AS </p><p>WELL.  ANGELO SAID THAT HE IS NOT SURE THAT THE WHEAT </p><p>NOW IN THE FIELDS WILL BE HARVESTED.

(WE HAVE HEARD SIMILAR STORIES BUT </p><p>CANNOT QUANTIFY WHAT THE SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS ARE OTHER </p><p>THAN LESS GRAIN IS LIKELY TO BE HARVESTED.)  THERE WERE </p><p>ALSO MORE SQUATTERS IN EVIDENCE, AND GROWING CHAOS </p><p>SWIRLING AROUND THE ENTIRE RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ANGELO CALCULATED (BY WHAT METHODOLOGY WE DON\'T </p><p>KNOW) THAT IN SPITE OF THE MANY VARIABLES, A 300-400,000 </p><p>MT SHORTAGE IS LIKELY IN 2002.  DESPITE RUMORS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ WILL FORGO (UNSPECIFIED) EXTERNAL DEBT PAYMENTS AND </p><p>USE REVENUE FOR GOLD SALES TO FINANCE COMMERCIAL </p><p>PURCHASES, UNDP CONTACTS IN THE FINANCE MINISTRY SAY </p><p>THAT THEY ARE NOT PRIVY TO HOW THE GOZ WILL COME UP WITH </p><p>THE REQUIRED FOREX TO PAY FOR A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF </p><p>IMPORTS.  IN RESPONSE TO QUERIES FROM THE DONORS, ANGELO </p><p>SPECULATED THAT NGOS, INCLUDING MANY FAITH-BASED GROUPS, </p><p>WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MAKE UP FOR COMMERCIAL </p><p>SHORTFALLS THROUGH NON-GOVERNMENTAL DISTRIBUTION </p><p>PROGRAMS IN RURAL AREAS.  HE STATED BLUNTLY THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT GOZ/ZANU INSIDERS SEE SUCH "HUMANITARIAN" </p><p>INITIATIVES AS A TROJAN HORSE THAT COULD HAVE MUCH WIDER </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR ELECTORAL EDUCATION, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACTIVITIES, AND PROMOTION OF THE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT "OUR FRIEND JOSEPH (CHINOTIMBMA)" AND HIS ILK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02480  02 OF 03  221423Z </p><p>RISKED RUNNING THE NGOS OUT OF RURAL AREAS FASTER THAN </p><p>THEY WENT IN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SECRETARIAT: WHAT\'S IN A NAME? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ANGELO ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS </p><p>IN LAUNCHING A PROPOSED UNDP HUMANITARIAN SECRETARIAT, </p><p>ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN AUGUST, </p><p>BECAUSE THE GOZ HAS NOT GIVEN UNDP A GREEN LIGHT.  (THE </p><p>SWEDES, DUTCH AND US HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR </p><p>THIS INITIATIVE.)  ANGELO SAID THAT HE MAY HAVE NO </p><p>OPTION BUT TO MOVE AHEAD AND ESTABLISH THIS </p><p>UNILATERALLY, BRINGING IT IN UNDER THE GOZ\'S RADAR USING </p><p>THE RUBRIC OF A "RELIEF AND RECOVERY UNIT".  ABSENT GOZ </p><p>APPROVAL OR TERMS OF REFERENCE, HE WOULD BILL THIS AS AN </p><p>INTEGRAL PART OF UNDP PROGRAMMING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PROGRAM THE PROBLEM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ANGELO SAID THAT THIS APPROACH (ALSO A TROJAN </p><p>HORSE) WOULD PERMIT EXPEDITIOUS PLANNING.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>IT WOULD REQUIRE COSMETIC PROGRAMS -- CHILD SURVIVAL </p><p>NEED ASSESSMENT, ETC. -- BEHIND WHICH IT COULD BEGIN </p><p>ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING FOR FOOD DELIVERY MECHANISMS. </p><p>SEVERAL OF THE DONORS RIGHTLY BALKED AT THIS.  THE DFID </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OBSERVED THAT IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO DO A </p><p>NUMBER OF SMALL REGIONAL BILATERAL PROGRAMS UNDER THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02480  02 OF 03  221423Z </p><p>RADAR RATHER THAN A LARGER, MULTILATERAL EFFORT.  THE </p><p>SWEDES AGREED, POINTING OUT THAT THE FOOD SHORTAGES </p><p>COULD PROVE TO CONFIRM INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY </p><p>WILL BE LOCALIZED.  THE DFID TEAM ALSO REJECTED OUT OF </p><p>HAND RECENT GOZ SUGGESTIONS THAT A REGIONAL APPROACH BE </p><p>TAKEN, SINCE IN DFID\'S VIEW THIS WOULD PERMIT THE GOZ TO </p><p>SANITIZE GRANT COMMODITIES THROUGH AN UPRIGHT NEIGHBOR </p><p>SUCH AS BOTSWANA BEFORE LAYING HANDS ON THE CEREALS FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) OTHER PARTICIPANTS UNDERLINED THAT THE LACK OF </p><p>WFP EXPERTISE ON THE GROUND COULD BE A SERIOUS </p><p>IMPEDIMENT TO AN INDEPENDENT AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. </p><p>ANGELO SAID THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS TAPPING WFP </p><p>PERSONNEL FROM ZAMBIA AND MOZAMBIQUE TO BRIDGE THE GAP. </p><p>THERE WAS A FINAL CONSENSUS AMONG THE DONORS THAT NONE </p><p>OF THEM FAVOR A RELIEF AND RECOVERY UNIT THAT AT THIS </p><p>TIME GOES BEYOND AN ASSESSMENT, MONITORING AND </p><p>COORDINATION ROLE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SWEDES, </p><p>EVERYONE WANTED TO SEE WHAT FOOD DELIVERY MECHANISMS </p><p>COULD BE IDENTIFIED BEFORE COMMITTING RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4899 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02480  03 OF 03  221423Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  BBG-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------151F26  221424Z /68 </p><p>O 221125Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9524 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF AGRICULTURE USD FAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CORRECTED COPY - USDA FAS WASHDC ADDED AS ADDEE NOT PASS TO </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA, NAN NEWMAN, LANCE DOWNING, AND C.W.T. </p><p>HAGELMAN; ALSO FOR B/HR/FFP JON BRAUSE </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA FOR AGATT RICK HELMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, EAGR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02480  03 OF 03  221423Z </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP AND DONORS MEET ON FOOD AID FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>10.

ANGELO SAID THAT GMB HAS ONLY </p><p>87 METRIC TONS OF WHEAT ON HAND, WITH THE REMAINDER </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 40,500 MT) IN PRIVATE HANDS.  ANGELO </p><p>ESTIMATED THIS AS ABOUT SIX WEEKS OF SUPPLY.  MAIZE IS </p><p>SIMILARLY PROBLEMATIC, SINCE BOTH SMALL HOLDERS AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE HOLDING BACK THEIR STOCKS FROM </p><p>THE MARKET.  (THIS COULD BE A WHOLLY WISE BUSINESS </p><p>DECISION IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION OF RAMPANT </p><p>INFLATION WHERE COMMODITIES ARE WORTH MORE THAN </p><p>DEPRECIATING CASH.)  THE GMB HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>PURCHASE 32,000 MT TO DATE.  SGR STOCKS ARE BEING DRAWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02480  01 OF 03  221200Z </p><p>DOWN AND WITH MARKET PRICES INCREASING, THE SGR IS </p><p>PROBABLY SHOWING A PROFIT ON PAPER, BUT IN HIGHLY </p><p>OVERVALUED CURRENCY.  THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM IS THE </p><p>GMB\'S OFFERING PRICE OF ZIMBABWE DOLLAR (ZD) 7,500/MT, </p><p>FAR BELOW THE ZD 12,000/MT OFFERED BY PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>BUYERS BEFORE THE GMB TOOK MONOPOLISTIC CONTROL OF THE </p><p>MARKET AND PROBABLY LESS THAN PRODUCER COST. (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS TOO REFLECTS THE MARKET AT WORK OUTSIDE THE </p><p>PARASTATAL GRAIN BOARDS, AND FURTHER SHOWS THE </p><p>INCREASING SCARCITY OF MAIZE AND WHEAT AND THE STEEP </p><p>DECLINE OF THE ZD.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SUB) TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS, THE GMB HAS ZD </p><p>1.3 BILLION BUDGETED FOR THE PURCHASING CAMPAIGN; ZD 6 </p><p>BILLION IS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE ENTIRE CROP.  THE </p><p>GMB NOW HOLDS 258,000 MT OF MAIZE, WITH ANOTHER 60,000 </p><p>MT IN PRIVATE HANDS, A SUPPLY THAT COULD BE STRETCHED TO </p><p>MEET FOUR MONTHS OF CONSUMPTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THERE ARE ADDITIONAL, LONGER-TERM CONCERNS AS </p><p>WELL.  ANGELO SAID THAT HE IS NOT SURE THAT THE WHEAT </p><p>NOW IN THE FIELDS WILL BE HARVESTED.

(C) ANGELO CALCULATED (BY WHAT METHODOLOGY WE DON\'T </p><p>KNOW) THAT IN SPITE OF THE MANY VARIABLES, A 300-400,000 </p><p>MT SHORTAGE IS LIKELY IN 2002.  DESPITE RUMORS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ WILL FORGO (UNSPECIFIED) EXTERNAL DEBT PAYMENTS AND </p><p>USE REVENUE FOR GOLD SALES TO FINANCE COMMERCIAL </p><p>PURCHASES, UNDP CONTACTS IN THE FINANCE MINISTRY SAY </p><p>THAT THEY ARE NOT PRIVY TO HOW THE GOZ WILL COME UP WITH </p><p>THE REQUIRED FOREX TO PAY FOR A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF </p><p>IMPORTS.  IN RESPONSE TO QUERIES FROM THE DONORS, ANGELO </p><p>SPECULATED THAT NGOS, INCLUDING MANY FAITH-BASED GROUPS, </p><p>WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MAKE UP FOR COMMERCIAL </p><p>SHORTFALLS THROUGH NON-GOVERNMENTAL DISTRIBUTION </p><p>PROGRAMS IN RURAL AREAS.  HE STATED BLUNTLY THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT GOZ/ZANU INSIDERS SEE SUCH "HUMANITARIAN" </p><p>INITIATIVES AS A TROJAN HORSE THAT COULD HAVE MUCH WIDER </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR ELECTORAL EDUCATION, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACTIVITIES, AND PROMOTION OF THE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT "OUR FRIEND JOSEPH (CHINOTIMBMA)" AND HIS ILK </p><p>RISKED RUNNING THE NGOS OUT OF RURAL AREAS FASTER THAN </p><p>THEY WENT IN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02480  02 OF 03  221201Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SECRETARIAT: WHAT\'S IN A NAME? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ANGELO ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS </p><p>IN LAUNCHING A PROPOSED UNDP HUMANITARIAN SECRETARIAT, </p><p>ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN AUGUST, </p><p>BECAUSE THE GOZ HAS NOT GIVEN UNDP A GREEN LIGHT.  (THE </p><p>SWEDES, DUTCH AND US HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR </p><p>THIS INITIATIVE.)  ANGELO SAID THAT HE MAY HAVE NO </p><p>OPTION BUT TO MOVE AHEAD AND ESTABLISH THIS </p><p>UNILATERALLY, BRINGING IT IN UNDER THE GOZ\'S RADAR USING </p><p>THE RUBRIC OF A "RELIEF AND RECOVERY UNIT".  ABSENT GOZ </p><p>APPROVAL OR TERMS OF REFERENCE, HE WOULD BILL THIS AS AN </p><p>INTEGRAL PART OF UNDP PROGRAMMING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PROGRAM THE PROBLEM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ANGELO SAID THAT THIS APPROACH (ALSO A TROJAN </p><p>HORSE) WOULD PERMIT EXPEDITIOUS PLANNING.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>IT WOULD REQUIRE COSMETIC PROGRAMS -- CHILD SURVIVAL </p><p>NEED ASSESSMENT, ETC. -- BEHIND WHICH IT COULD BEGIN </p><p>ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING FOR FOOD DELIVERY MECHANISMS. </p><p>SEVERAL OF THE DONORS RIGHTLY BALKED AT THIS.  THE DFID </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OBSERVED THAT IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO DO A </p><p>NUMBER OF SMALL REGIONAL BILATERAL PROGRAMS UNDER THE </p><p>RADAR RATHER THAN A LARGER, MULTILATERAL EFFORT.  THE </p><p>SWEDES AGREED, POINTING OUT THAT THE FOOD SHORTAGES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02480  02 OF 03  221201Z </p><p>COULD PROVE TO CONFIRM INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY </p><p>WILL BE LOCALIZED.  THE DFID TEAM ALSO REJECTED OUT OF </p><p>HAND RECENT GOZ SUGGESTIONS THAT A REGIONAL APPROACH BE </p><p>TAKEN, SINCE IN DFID\'S VIEW THIS WOULD PERMIT THE GOZ TO </p><p>SANITIZE GRANT COMMODITIES THROUGH AN UPRIGHT NEIGHBOR </p><p>SUCH AS BOTSWANA BEFORE LAYING HANDS ON THE CEREALS FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) OTHER PARTICIPANTS UNDERLINED THAT THE LACK OF </p><p>WFP EXPERTISE ON THE GROUND COULD BE A SERIOUS </p><p>IMPEDIMENT TO AN INDEPENDENT AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. </p><p>ANGELO SAID THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS TAPPING WFP </p><p>PERSONNEL FROM ZAMBIA AND MOZAMBIQUE TO BRIDGE THE GAP. </p><p>THERE WAS A FINAL CONSENSUS AMONG THE DONORS THAT NONE </p><p>OF THEM FAVOR A RELIEF AND RECOVERY UNIT THAT AT THIS </p><p>TIME GOES BEYOND AN ASSESSMENT, MONITORING AND </p><p>COORDINATION ROLE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SWEDES, </p><p>EVERYONE WANTED TO SEE WHAT FOOD DELIVERY MECHANISMS </p><p>COULD BE IDENTIFIED BEFORE COMMITTING RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4385 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02480  03 OF 03  221201Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------150F04  221201Z /75 </p><p>O 221125Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9524 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA, NAN NEWMAN, LANCE DOWNING, AND C.W.T. </p><p>HAGELMAN; ALSO FOR B/HR/FFP JON BRAUSE </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA FOR AGATT RICK HELMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP AND DONORS MEET ON FOOD AID FOR ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02480  03 OF 03  221201Z </p><p> </p><p>10.
