Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: The Sri Lankan government is considering </p><p>whether to re-impose capital punishment, which remains </p><p>on the books, but has not been used since 1976.  Some in </p><p>the GSL say the death penalty would be useful to counter </p><p>rising crime rates.  The Prime Minister\'s view is not </p><p>yet clear.  The president is believed to be leaning </p><p>against the death penalty, while human rights groups are </p><p>strongly opposed.  In pushing for the death penalty, </p><p>some in the GSL seem to sense a vote-winning issue.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>Some Press for Death Penalty </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Sri Lankan government is seriously mulling </p><p>over the possible return of capital punishment.  While </p><p>the death penalty remains on the books as a punishment </p><p>for murder, it has not been imposed since 1976. </p><p>(Note:  In fact, although there have been many extra- </p><p>judicial killings by both sides, the death penalty has </p><p>not been imposed by the GSL as a matter of law during </p><p>the course of its conflict with the Tamil Tigers.) </p><p>Interior Minister John Amaratunga has taken a lead role </p><p>in pressing for the use of the death penalty and he was </p><p>recently photographed as he inspected the gallows at </p><p>Colombo\'s Welikada prison.  (Note:  Hanging has been the </p><p>traditional mode of executions in Sri Lanka, although </p><p>the GSL is studying other options, including the </p><p>electric chair and lethal injection.)  Amaratunga, a </p><p>gruff, tough-minded politician, has been quoted as </p><p>stating that he would like to see the death penalty used </p><p>within the next several months. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In making his case for the use of capital </p><p>punishment, Amaratunga has claimed that it is needed in </p><p>order to counter rising crime rates.  He has asserted, </p><p>for example, that gang members and others in the </p><p>underworld would take the death penalty seriously as a </p><p>deterrent.  (Note:  When asked about the crime </p><p>situation, most contacts agree that crime rates have </p><p>risen in Sri Lanka in the past couple of years, though </p><p>not dramatically.  They add that there has been a </p><p>noticeable increase in gangland-type killings, however. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>PM\'s Views Not Clear </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Amaratunga\'s campaign for the return of capital </p><p>punishment has powerful supporters in the governing </p><p>United National Party (UNP).  Chief among them is Karu </p><p>Jayasuriya, the Minister for Power and Energy and deputy </p><p>leader of the UNP.  In his typical sphinx-like manner, </p><p>however, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has not made his </p><p>views clear.  Desmond Fernando, a well-known human </p><p>rights attorney and close friend of the PM, has told us </p><p>that he does not believe Wickremesinghe will go along </p><p>with Amaratunga\'s effort, as the PM does not see the re- </p><p>imposition of the death penalty as a key tool in </p><p>fighting crime.  Fernando added that the Prime Minister </p><p>remained willing to examine all views, however, and was </p><p>planning to discuss the issue further at upcoming </p><p>cabinet meetings. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>President:  Leaning Against </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In order to move forward with the death penalty, </p><p>the GSL would need the support of the president, who has </p><p>to sign off on any executions per Sri Lanka\'s criminal </p><p>code.  Thus far, President Kumaratunga has not made </p><p>clear whether or not she would support a decision by the </p><p>government to re-impose the death penalty.  That said, </p><p>the president is believed to be leaning against its re- </p><p>imposition.  On this point, Desmond Fernando noted to us </p><p>that her views on social matters were often influenced </p><p>by her Francophile leanings (she was educated in France) </p><p>and her desire to be seen as a "liberal."  Given these </p><p>tendencies, he doubted she would support any effort to </p><p>bring back the death penalty. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) (((Note:  The president is also known to </p><p>treasure her family\'s role in Sri Lankan politics.  This </p><p>factor also tends to reinforce the conclusion that she </p><p>will not support the death penalty.  After all, it was </p><p>her father, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who </p><p>put in place the first moratorium on the use of the </p><p>death penalty in Sri Lanka\'s history.  After </p><p>Bandaranaike\'s assassination in 1959, the death penalty </p><p>was re-imposed.  Her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who </p><p>served as PM subsequently, supported the use of the </p><p>death penalty only sparingly.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Human Rights Groups Opposed </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Human rights groups are rapidly becoming </p><p>mobilized against the possible return of the death </p><p>penalty.  M. Remadious, an adviser with the Center for </p><p>Human Rights and Development, a local NGO, told us that </p><p>his group had recently met and discussed ways to protest </p><p>against the death penalty.  Remadious said further </p><p>meetings were planned.  Dr. P. Saravanumuttu, co- </p><p>director of the Center for Policy Alternatives, another </p><p>well-known local NGO, told us that his group was </p><p>strongly against the death penalty and would participate </p><p>in upcoming meetings on ways to prevent its re- </p><p>imposition in Sri Lanka.  (Note:  Sri Lanka is a </p><p>predominately Buddhist country and some Buddhist groups </p><p>oppose the use of the death penalty citing religious </p><p>strictures.  Many Buddhists, including some in the top </p><p>clergy, do not see their religion as being in conflict </p><p>with the use of the death penalty, however.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In pushing for the death penalty, some in the </p><p>GSL seem to sense a vote-winning issue.  Interior </p><p>Minister Amaratunga, for example, clearly sees the issue </p><p>as a way to highlight his anti-crime, anti-vice efforts </p><p>to a public that is believed to favor strongly the </p><p>return of the death penalty.  Our guess is that </p><p>Amaratunga\'s effort may come up short inasmuch as he </p><p>probably cannot count on President Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>support.  That said, Kumaratunga has to approach the </p><p>issue cautiously as the death penalty is popular with </p><p>the public at large.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
