AKP won 84.75 percent of the vote. </p><p>There was a 62.31 percent turnout, largely due to the </p><p>election boycott by pro-Kurdish DEHAP.  President Sezer will </p><p>task Erdogan on March 13 or 14 to form a new government, </p><p>according to press reports.  The new distribution of seats </p><p>in parliament is: AKP 365, CHP 177, DYP 2, and 6 </p><p>independents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Monday\'s dailies say U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Robert </p><p>Pearson, reminded Erdogan about the U.S. ultimatum to Iraq </p><p>to fully disarm by March 17, and urged him to submit a new </p><p>decree for deployment of foreign troops in Turkey to the </p><p>parliament by that date.  Erdogan in turn brought to the </p><p>agenda Ankara\'s concern about the status of the Turkomen, </p><p>and asked for solid guarantees against a prospective Kurdish </p><p>state in Iraq.  Speaking to a TV channel on Sunday, Erdogan </p><p>called on the U.S. to take some steps forward which would </p><p>enable Ankara to `soften the atmosphere,\' and thus convince </p><p>renegade deputies.  Sunday\'s papers claim that visiting U.S. </p><p>Congressmen pressed Ankara to pass the motion on Monday. </p><p>Monday\'s "Cumhuriyet" reports on the February 8 `secret </p><p>agreement\' on base modernization between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey.  According to the report, the agreement allows for </p><p>the transfer of U.S. military personnel to the Southeast, </p><p>including the establishment of a logistical base in Mardin, </p><p>where 600 American technicians and 200 military personnel </p><p>will settle.  Sunday\'s papers highlight parliamentary </p><p>speaker Arinc\'s complaint about the ongoing transfer of U.S. </p><p>equipment from the port of Iskenderun to the Southeast.  CHP </p><p>is about to submit a bill to the parliament requesting a </p><p>parliamentary inquiry regarding the U.S. military </p><p>mobilization in the region.  Saturday\'s papers report PUK </p><p>leader Talabani\'s representative Barham Salih\'s meetings </p><p>with the MFA on Friday, after which Salih said he received </p><p>guarantees from the Turks that northern Iraq will not be </p><p>occupied.  U/S of State Grossman warned Ankara again on CNN- </p><p>Turk on Friday to refrain from intervention in northern </p><p>Iraq.  Reports highlight Grossman\'s remarks that the U.S. is </p><p>capable of opening a northern front without Turkey\'s </p><p>assistance.  Saturday\'s "Hurriyet" reports on its front page </p><p>that Mersin port\'s operations director Bekir Kucuksahin was </p><p>sacked for clearing the port facilities to enable the </p><p>unloading of U.S. military equipment from the Panama-flagged </p><p>Cec Meridian vessel.  Hurriyet says Kucuksahin was sacked by </p><p>the harbor management for `weakening their hand\' in the </p><p>bargaining with Americans about the rental fee.  The Cec </p><p>Meridian, waiting at the Mersin harbor since March 5, was </p><p>not allowed to unload. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: AKP leader Erdogan criticized UN Secretary General </p><p>Annan on Sunday for `deceiving\' Ankara after having promised </p><p>changes in the third plan regarding the sovereignty and </p><p>migration issues.  The changes were allegedly not made.  `We </p><p>cannot accept the plan in its current shape.  However, Turks </p><p>will go to The Hague. We will not burn bridges,\' Erdogan </p><p>said.  Denktas flew to The Hague on Sunday to reject the </p><p>Annan plan.  Meanwhile, 15,000 Turkish Cypriots rallied </p><p>against Denktas on Sunday. Turkish Cypriot opposition </p><p>parties have decided to boycott the parliament until March </p><p>30, and said they would carry out the referendum on the </p><p>scheduled date even if the parliament decides against the </p><p>Annan proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>a) Iraq/US-Turkey </p><p>b) Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is the last week" </p><p>Yasemin Congar wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (3/10): "It </p><p>seems very unlikely that the war can be stopped at this </p><p>stage.  The Bush administration is not going to change its </p><p>policy, even though the French-led split at the UNSC signals </p><p>a potential risk of polarization within the Western world. </p><p>It also seems very unlikely that Saddam Hussein will take a </p><p>significant step which might change the course of events. </p><p>Talking to US officials in Washington, I have come to the </p><p>conclusion that nothing can possibly prevent the war. . The </p><p>US will use the next couple of days in efforts to convince </p><p>the six `undecided\' members of the UNSC.  There are some </p><p>members who clearly stand against a new resolution. Yet the </p><p>fact of the matter is that Washington\'s focus is not on the </p><p>opposition at the UNSC anymore, but is more concerned about </p><p>the war and post-war possibilities.  President Bush is well </p><p>aware of the fact that this war is to play a determinative </p><p>role in his political future. . The administration in </p><p>general is very optimistic about a short and effective war </p><p>in Iraq which, as they predict, will lead to a quick </p><p>restructuring of Iraq.  In the end, they believe, the Iraqis </p><p>will treat the US as a savior.  The optimism goes even </p><p>further.  Washington believes that a newly restructured Iraq </p><p>will stand as a model to other Arab countries, and that an </p><p>Iraq operation will be the way to establish peace and </p><p>stability in the Middle East.  In the event that this very </p><p>optimistic scenario comes true, we might see George Bush as </p><p>the new Harry Truman." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The strategic mistrust between Turkey and the US on the </p><p>Kurdish issue" </p><p>Ali Aslan writes from Washington in the Islamic-intellectual </p><p>Zaman (3/10): "It is interesting to observe the strong </p><p>opposition to a Turkish incursion in northern Iraq among </p><p>both the `hawks\' and `doves\' in Washington.  The American </p><p>press, right after the parliamentary vote, joined the chorus </p><p>with a series of articles signaling a potential clash </p><p>between Turkey and Kurdish groups. . The strangest part of </p><p>the story comes with the fact that in the event of </p><p>parliamentary approval, the Turkish military would have been </p><p>in northern Iraq anyway.  How would those Kurdish groups </p><p>with strong anti-Turkish sentiment have reacted then?  Most </p><p>of these Kurdish leaders take every step by consulting with </p><p>Washington first.  How could they speak so much against </p><p>Turkey?  Why is Washington unable to stop them? . Since the </p><p>US has assumed the role of Iraq\'s restructuring, and since </p><p>the US is close enough to both the Turks and the Kurds, all </p><p>of the potential risks can be eliminated if Washington </p><p>handles the events with common sense.  That means being </p><p>objective and impartial.  There is a potential risk of </p><p>deepening Turkish-American strategic mistrust in the event </p><p>that Washington loses its objectivity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Search for a settlement on Cyprus" </p><p>Erdal Guven opined in the intellectual-liberal Radikal </p><p>(3/10): "The Turkish Cypriot side suffers from a lack of </p><p>political will for a solution, and the Greek Cypriot side </p><p>demonstrates significant uncertainty about its policy.  In </p><p>the meantime, the clock is ticking toward the deadline.  By </p><p>remembering the previously-imposed yet unimplemented </p><p>deadlines, we can expect that there might be another date -- </p><p>March 25, for example -- to reach a settlement. . However, </p><p>there is not much hope, at least from the meeting today in </p><p>the Hague. . The outcome of the Hague process, as a matter </p><p>of fact, will not only affect Cyprus but also will affect a </p><p>large number of things, predominantly Turkish-Greek </p><p>relations, stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkish- </p><p>American relations, and Turkish-EU relations.  It is a fact </p><p>that a mistake during the Hague process will not be easily </p><p>corrected." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
