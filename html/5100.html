<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000103 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EIND, EINV, ETRD, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTIONS 2003: THE PROSPECTIVE ECONOMY AND THE </p><p>PRICE OF POLITICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary. On November 19 some forty corporate executives </p><p>representing a broad cross-section of the non-oil sector met </p><p>at the Lagos Business School to discuss the potential </p><p>economic impact of the 2003 general elections.  During the </p><p>session led by Professor Pat Utomi, many executives expressed </p><p>concern about the uncertainty associated with the upcoming </p><p>general elections and their likely impact on the investment </p><p>climate. Most of the executives fear that fiscal indiscipline </p><p>will worsen as the spring elections approach, which will fuel </p><p>inflation, raise interest rates, and depreciate the naira; </p><p>most participants disclosed that their firms are consequently </p><p>postponing major investments until after the elections. </p><p>Alternative economic thinking, predicated on the desirability </p><p>of priming the pump, nevertheless posits a more positive </p><p>outcome of an expansion in government spending in the run up </p><p>to the spring elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. During the program at the business school, the consensus </p><p>was aired that the biggest impediment to private sector </p><p>investment in Nigeria is political uncertainty.  Utomi </p><p>contends, for example, that the government\'s process for </p><p>implementing economic policy has been poorly coordinated and </p><p>characterized by mixed signals, with long-term objectives </p><p>often being sacrificed for short-term political gains.  Many </p><p>business executives echoed this opinion and faulted the </p><p>government for its frequent and sudden changes in both policy </p><p>and its implementation, making long-term investment decisions </p><p>difficult.  An example is President Obasanjo\'s recent </p><p>declaration that oil producers should end gas flaring by the </p><p>end of 2004 instead of by 2008 as envisaged earlier. </p><p>According to Utomi, the business executives he has talked to </p><p>all expect greater uncertainty as the elections approach and </p><p>are, therefore postponing major investments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Many executives also fear that the government may go on a </p><p>"spending spree" during the next five months to secure </p><p>political support.  Here, we use the word government </p><p>inclusively to cover all branches and all tiers of </p><p>government.  In general, the National Assembly has been far </p><p>more inclined to be profligate than the Presidency.  The </p><p>latter\'s attempt throughout much of 2002 to check the </p><p>legislature\'s propensity for spending resulted in a stalemate </p><p>between these two branches of government.  But even without </p><p>executive-legislative agreement on a budget, federal funds </p><p>can still be expended in an undisciplined fashion.  The </p><p>President can disburse up to fifty percent of the expected </p><p>annual recurrent budget revenues of any fiscal year without </p><p>National Assembly approval.  Excessive non-discretionary and </p><p>discretionary spending by the federal government accounts for </p><p>continuing deficit spending.  Reflecting this fact, Central </p><p>Bank data on extensions of credit to the economy, in </p><p>particular to government, show that the level in 2002 was far </p><p>above the target figures established late 2001.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>federal structure compounds the problem. The fiscal </p><p>authorities of the state and local governments have been </p><p>irresponsible in the past three years.  Having recklessly </p><p>expended borrowed funds, the state and local governments have </p><p>spent their allotments from the proceeds of the Federation </p><p>Account in an equally cavalier fashion.  That account is </p><p>funded largely by oil export proceeds and is apportioned </p><p>according to a 54.68; 24.72; 20.60 ratio.  The federal fiscal </p><p>authorities can do little to influence such spending by the </p><p>states and local governments, even when it destabilizes the </p><p>economy. Consequently and unsurprisingly, many of the </p><p>executives at Lagos Business School forum said they expect </p><p>excessive spending will continue even well after the general </p><p>elections, as the victorious politicians will want to reward </p><p>faithful supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. According to Utomi, the problem with such a likely </p><p>expansionary fiscal policy is that it will fail to take </p><p>account of the absorptive capacity of the economy.  Since the </p><p>infrastructure cannot absorb a massive infusion of capital </p><p>effectively, few if any of the funds that will be disbursed </p><p>will translate into meaningful economic activity.  The funds </p><p>that will be disbursed to procure votes, he said, will </p><p>typically be channeled into the hands of a select few people </p><p>who will spend most of the windfall on imported goods or </p><p>exchange it for hard currency to be banked or spent abroad. </p><p>Should the foreign exchange market be flooded with naira, </p><p>Nigeria\'s reserves will dwindle since the Central Bank will </p><p>be under pressure to control the naira\'s depreciation. Utomi </p><p>asserted that even with regard to legitimate government </p><p>contracts, eighty kobos of every naira (100 kobos to a naira) </p><p>flow into the foreign exchange market in search of hard </p><p>currency for capital expenditures.  Regardless of where the </p><p>funds will go, whether for legtimate expenditures or </p><p>procurement of votes, all the executives at the forum expect </p><p>that government-induced excess liquidity will generate </p><p>economic instability in the form higher prices for domestic </p><p>or foreign goods and services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment.  Alternative economic thinking may justify the </p><p>government measures mentioned above.  Although conventional </p><p>wisdom argues against a sharp and sustained expansion of </p><p>credit to the government, it is conceivable that, since </p><p>government spending is an engine of growth, we might see a </p><p>pick up in economic activity before April based on higher </p><p>government spending in the run up to the elections.  While </p><p>some private sector firms may not want to invest in a period </p><p>of uncertainty, the government is a large client of other </p><p>firms.  Thus many firms may be caught in a bind; while </p><p>political uncertainty may make them bearish, the chance of </p><p>landing government contracts may overcome their skittishness </p><p>in instances. Thus, if the GON can "turn on" spending during </p><p>the first half of the year and then turn it off during the </p><p>second half, the stimulus of the first six months might not </p><p>greatly compound actual economic disequilibria.  While such </p><p>an outcome might be unlikely, GON strategists may be trying </p><p>to do this.  Even if it is improbable that they might </p><p>succeed--because the "on/off" switch cannot be made to work </p><p>instantaneously--there is nonetheless an off chance that they </p><p>might achieve success if spending were to fund productive </p><p>activity and enlarge Nigeria\'s absorptive capacity for </p><p>investable funds.  Of course, should such a strategy fail, </p><p>the result would be even more destabilizing to private sector </p><p>firms and individuals than if the GON had opted for an </p><p>orthodox strategy.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Utomi asserted that years of military rule in Nigeria </p><p>left a legacy of fractured institutions to the civilian </p><p>government that is a cause of today\'s fiscal indiscipline. </p><p>In the absence of a well-ordered, functional federal </p><p>executive-legislative decision making apparatus that ensures </p><p>stability and predictability, policy is easily reversed (and </p><p>re-reversed) to suit political whims. In this regard, Utomi </p><p>singled out the National Assembly for its lack of </p><p>appreciation for sound economic policy.  To make his point, </p><p>Utomi said he had asked a well-known Senator recently whether </p><p>"the Assembly was concerned about the health of the economy </p><p>before next year\'s elections."  The Senator replied: "Let me </p><p>assure you, no one in the Assembly understands the economy </p><p>and no one cares."  Utomi went on that it is not surprising </p><p>then that the Assembly tends to be "flexible" with </p><p>legislation and that it often changes course when politically </p><p>expedient. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment.  Utomi is influential in certain circles, but his </p><p>is only one voice.  Politicking will fuel the economy in the </p><p>first quarter, perhaps well into the second, even if oil </p><p>prices begin to drop.  While private sector firms may be </p><p>restraining investment in front of elections, doing so is a </p><p>rational decision given the uncertainty that elections imply. </p><p> Once elections are over and the country\'s direction is </p><p>clearer, these firms likely will begin to invest again. </p><p>However, Nigeria\'s economic fundamentals are not strong and </p><p>could weaken by mid-year as expenditures rise at all levels </p><p>of government in front of general elections, possibly causing </p><p>higher inflation and interest rates, as well as instability </p><p>in the foreign exchange market.  This would be bad news for </p><p>most Nigerians whose real per capita income will probably </p><p>have declined in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Although the various tiers of government have been </p><p>incapable or unwilling to implement sound fiscal policy, the </p><p>private sector too has failed to promote its interests </p><p>effectively.  Businesses have compiled long litanies of </p><p>complaints against the government, but they have done little </p><p>to ensure that specific solutions are implemented.  Lacking </p><p>entrepreneurial spirit, many private sector firms hold out </p><p>for government subsidies or other incentives (understandable </p><p>given the policy environment) rather than show initiative, </p><p>which results in serious inertia. Many businesspeople are </p><p>engaged in rent-seeking activity, benefit from their access </p><p>to politicians and consequent ability to influence the policy </p><p>environment and, ultimately, are not particularly interested </p><p>in holding political leaders accountable for their actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
