<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002508 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EAGR, ENRG, EFIN, PREL, KPAO, NI, UNCSD </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO TO HEAD WSSD </p><p>DELEGATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 151258 </p><p>     B. B) STATE 158974 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary. The Nigerian delegation to the World </p><p>Summit on Sustainable Development (WSD) will be led by </p><p>President Obasanjo and include Ministers for Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Agriculture, Environment, Finance, African Integration and </p><p>Energy (Presidential Advisor Rilwanu Lukman).  Nigerian </p><p>contacts in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Environment </p><p>received reftel talking points and agreed on the need for the </p><p>WSSD to limit itself to concrete programs with a chance for </p><p>implementation and eventual success.  While Nigerian actions </p><p>at international fora are hard to predict, for the WSSD the </p><p>present delegation seems well disposed to a high degree of </p><p>cooperation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) President Olusegun Obasanjo, recently criticized for </p><p>his foreign travels, may limit his attendance to September 2 </p><p>only, when he is scheduled to give the 47th presentation to </p><p>the WSSD.  According to Director of the 2nd UN office of the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, M.K. Ibrahim, Obasanjo </p><p>personally reduced the size of the Nigerian delegation from </p><p>102 to thirty and many of the offices were in a state of </p><p>confusion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Minister of State for Environmental Affairs Imeh </p><p>Okopido responded to the demarche by stressing Nigeria\'s </p><p>agreement with the U.S. on the importance of partnerships, </p><p>and relayed his gratitutude for USG support for the African </p><p>Process (Reftel b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Participation by Lukman shows the GON is taking the </p><p>energy portion of the agenda seriously.  Contacts at both the </p><p>Ministry of the Environment and MFA said they expected to </p><p>work closely with the U.S. and that Nigeria shared many of </p><p>our concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: In recent international fora the degree of </p><p>Nigerian cooperation has varied.  Positive WTO meetings in </p><p>Doha were followed by a less collaboration in Monterrey. </p><p>Neveretheless, we believe that working-level and senior </p><p>members of the WSSD delegation are open to greater </p><p>cooperation with the U.S., and with a little luck might be </p><p>kept from reverting to obstructionist positions, whether they </p><p>be those of the G-77 or OPEC.       End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
