Seven weeks after the May 4 crash of an EAS </p><p>BAC 1-11 in Kano, the GON response has lost momentum. NTSB </p><p>investigator Jones indicated official investigation was </p><p>substandard and likely to produce inaccurate results. </p><p>Aviation Minister Chikwe continues to change personnel and </p><p>bruit new policies, more out of concern to manage political </p><p>fallout than to find the truth. Some of these changes seem </p><p>positive, but we do not expect most to be significant. Much </p><p>water has passed under the bridge, so the true causes of the </p><p>May 4 crash may remain unknown. We should urge the GON to </p><p>fund oversight properly and to give its oversight body </p><p>greater independence. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>REAL REFORM OR PERFORMING FOR THE PUBLIC </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Minister of Aviation Dr. Kema Chikwe fired over 20 </p><p>officials in the wake of the May 4 crash at Kano (Ref. A) of </p><p>a BAC 1-11 operated by Executive Air Services (EAS).  The </p><p>Director General and Director of Airworthiness of the </p><p>Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the Directors of </p><p>Engineering and Administration of the Federal Airports </p><p>Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and two Directors of Air Traffic </p><p>Services from the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) </p><p>were among the those receiving pink slips.  Media reports </p><p>suggest others may be on the way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Minister has also promised to replace all flight </p><p>instructors at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology </p><p>(NCAT) in Zaria with foreign experts, claiming the current </p><p>instructors are responsible for the failure of NCAT to </p><p>graduate students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Chikwe has also proposed banning all single aircraft </p><p>airline companies; they will have the option of merging with </p><p>other companies or going out of business. Complaining that </p><p>aircraft vendors in Miami were selling unfit aircraft at low </p><p>cost to Nigerian airlines, she has proposed that Nigerian </p><p>buyers obtain a certificate of airworthiness from countries </p><p>of origin before sales can be completed. Finally the Minister </p><p>has proposed reducing the number of licenses for aircraft </p><p>maintenance organizations to 20. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The actions taken by Chikwe are a mixed bag. </p><p>Banning single aircraft companies could prove useful, but </p><p>only if proper maintenance regimes are instituted for the </p><p>remaining airlines. However, Assistant Director Remi Faminu, </p><p>of the Ministry of Aviation\'s Accident Investigation Bureau </p><p>(AIB), believes operators with one craft fleets will lease </p><p>additional craft as cheaply as possible in order to meet the </p><p>new minimum requirements.  If so, this new regulation has the </p><p>potential to increase rather than decrease the number of </p><p>marginal air carriers. Faminu contends the proposal to reduce </p><p>the number of maintenance organizations is unrealistic. All </p><p>operators have their own maintenance crews; combining them </p><p>would be unworkable. Past attempts at similar remedies have </p><p>failed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Faminu also labeled the firings as purely political. </p><p>The crash gave Chikwe the opportunity to restructure the </p><p>affected agencies with fewer accusations than would have been </p><p>leveled under other circumstances.  According to Faminu, the </p><p>proposal to staff the NCAT faculty with foreign experts to </p><p>train pilots is a good one, provided the college can pay </p><p>market salaries.  According to Faminu one major reason for </p><p>the failure of the flight school is the high turnover of </p><p>instructors.  Nigerian instructors are paid on the Federal </p><p>compensation scale. They quickly leave NCAT when offered </p><p>higher paying piloting jobs in the private sector. Finally, </p><p>evaluating aircraft at the time of sale and guaranteeing </p><p>their airworthiness is an important step.  However, a regime </p><p>requiring proper maintenance after purchase is equally </p><p>important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>AN APPARENT RUSH TO JUDGMENT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) So far only one of the crashed plane\'s "black boxes" </p><p>has been found.  The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) is still </p><p>missing. Dennis Jones, of the National Transportation Safety </p><p>Board (NTSB), who visited Nigeria May 16-28, accompanied </p><p>POLCOUNS to a May 20 meeting with Minister Chikwe. She </p><p>claimed the CVR had been stolen from the crash site.  Chikwe </p><p>also asserted that an engine on the crashed plane had been </p><p>clandestinely changed during a holiday with no oversight or </p><p>inspection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) In the week after the crash, three separate panels </p><p>were announced to investigate the crash.  Minister Chikwe </p><p>proposed a twelve-member panel, while the House and the </p><p>Senate in the National Assembly established  separate </p><p>investigatory committees.  These committees were given </p><p>impractical mandates to complete their investigations in two </p><p>or three weeks.  So far the performance of the committees has </p><p>been uninspiring. For example the Senate committee used its </p><p>forum to condemn the conditions of Nigeria\'s airports which </p><p>seemed to be more an attempt by some Senators to get </p><p>advantageous press coverage while trying to roll the </p><p>political pork barrel their way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Jones, accompanied by Poloff and Econoff, met Director </p><p>K.K.O. Sagoe, Assistant Director Remi Faminu and Mr. C.O. </p><p>Awogbami of the AIB May 23. The AIB is the Nigerian </p><p>counterpart to the NTSB.  The Nigerian investigators </p><p>complained that the three above-mentioned panels were </p><p>composed of non-professionals who were reaching unreliable </p><p>conclusions from erroneous assumptions.  The National </p><p>Assembly committees, they believe, are using the tragedy as </p><p>an opportunity to score political points with their </p><p>constituencies.  Even Chikwe\'s committee, they claim, did not </p><p>have sufficient expertise. They also claimed that it was </p><p>improper for her to constitute such a panel; under Nigerian </p><p>law, they said, only the Justice Minister can establish such </p><p>a panel. Moreover, the Justice Minister must wait until after </p><p>the AIB investigation is completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While aspersing the special investigations, the AIB\'s </p><p>performance has not been exemplary.  Faminu is leading the </p><p>investigation. The AIB team gave us the following preliminary </p><p>report:  The BAC1-11 aircraft traversed the 2600m runway, the </p><p>60m of overrun area and an additional unpaved area of 150 </p><p>meters prior to taking off. This is indicative of low </p><p>airspeed and points to the likelihood that the aircraft was </p><p>near stall from the time it took off. The plane most likely </p><p>went into a deep stall, which on the BAC1-11 can only be </p><p>recovered by descending nose down for several thousand feet. </p><p>The aircraft never reached an altitude of greater than a few </p><p>hundred feet. Sagoe examined the wreckage, and his </p><p>preliminary finding is that one engine failed.  This </p><p>assessment is based on the way the engines were damaged and </p><p>the difference in the damage to the two engines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Faminu related some of the difficulties AIB faced in </p><p>attempting to conduct a thorough investigation. </p><p>Investigators were unable to survey the crash scene on May 4 </p><p>because of mobs surrounding the site. Sagoe stated that the </p><p>first officials at the scene were beaten by the angry mob. </p><p>Consequently Faminu was unable to make diagrams or take </p><p>pictures of the initial crash scene. Since much of the crash </p><p>site was altered before the investigators could examine it, </p><p>crucial indicators were lost. Faminu hopes the Digital Flight </p><p>Data Recorder (DFDR) along with cargo weight and exact </p><p>readouts of weather conditions will reveal the information </p><p>necessary to help determine what happened.  The Ministry does </p><p>not have the necessary equipment to interpret the recorder </p><p>data and will likely send it to the UK. Faminu stated in a </p><p>June 12 conversation that arrangements had been made to send </p><p>the DFDR to England and that he expected to have results by </p><p>the end of June. However, the DFDR had not been sent as of </p><p>June 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Awogbami stated that recordings between the tower and </p><p>cockpit contained no communication after clearance for </p><p>takeoff was given.  Faminu was unaware if radar readings were </p><p>available at the time of the crash. (Note: Media and Embassy </p><p>sources indicate that the radar at the Kano Airport has not </p><p>functioned for several years.  The investigators were either </p><p>unaware of this or trying to save embarrassment by feigning </p><p>ignorance. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The AIB, remains understaffed, under-funded and under </p><p>political pressure to find a quick answer. Jones was </p><p>concerned the political pressure might cause the AIB to </p><p>perform only a superficial investigation, obscuring the real </p><p>causes behind the crash. The initial work by AIB </p><p>investigators has been disappointing.  AIB had no photos, or </p><p>diagrams from the crash site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Jones visited the Kano crash site and was able to </p><p>view the wreckage that had been recovered. While noting  that </p><p>many factors unique to this crash prevented a perfect </p><p>investigation, Jones also noted the investigators had a </p><p>surprisingly casual attitude. They lacked enthusiasm and </p><p>failed to follow up on information.  For instance, no </p><p>attempts at interviewing witnesses were made, and the chief </p><p>investigator was uninterested in efforts to reconstruct the </p><p>wreckage. Jones urged the investigators to have the data </p><p>recorder read and expressed dismay that the investigation was </p><p>being conducted without the vital information available from </p><p>this source. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) In Reftel B, Post supported Minister Chikwe\'s request </p><p>for assistance investigating the crash.  After consulting </p><p>with Dennis Jones and Kevin Sample of DOT, Post  recommended </p><p>to Minister Chikwe that aviation expert Ron Montgomery serve </p><p>on the crash investigation panel.    However on June 6, the </p><p>Ministry asked that Montgomery delay his trip -- the  panel </p><p>had been postponed indefinitely. Awodu said that the panel </p><p>could not be established until completion of the AIB </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Many hoped the May 4 crash would shake the GON of its </p><p>lethargy regarding domestic air carriers.  Initially, the GON </p><p>showed energy and said the right things.  However, recent </p><p>signs indicate a flagging commitment.  This is all the more </p><p>tragic since two major crashes have been barely averted, and </p><p>another small crash, killing five, has taken place since the </p><p>May 4 crash.  While impossible at this date to identify the </p><p>real causes of the EAS crash, it is not difficult to identify </p><p>weaknesses in the Nigerian Government\'s handling of this </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Comment Continued: From all appearances, the Minister </p><p>of Aviation is more concerned about managing the political </p><p>fallout than in technical probity. Consequently, efforts to </p><p>investigate the crash and to examine the flight safety </p><p>standards of commercial carriers remains subject to political </p><p>pressures.  We should continue to work with the Ministry in </p><p>its overall modernization program, despite the flaws in its </p><p>response to the crash. However, this incident underscores the </p><p>need not only for better funding and training of the AIB but </p><p>greater independence of the AIB from the Aviation Ministry </p><p>itself. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
