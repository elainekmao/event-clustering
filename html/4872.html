The World Food Programme (WFP) resumed general food </p><p>distributions to Insiza District on Monday, December 16, </p><p>2002. The USAID Emergency Food for Peace Officer (FFPO) </p><p>visited two villages in Insiza district on December 18, </p><p>2002.  The FFPO monitored the distribution and verified </p><p>that the food assistance was being distributed to its </p><p>intended beneficiaries. Villagers in Insiza report that </p><p>they have not yet planted due to insufficient rainfall a </p><p>that they expect to remain dependent on WFP food </p><p>assistance.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>WFP RESUMES DISTRIBUTION IN INSIZA </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The WFP implementing partner (IP), the Organization o </p><p>Rural Associations for Progress (ORAP), resumed </p><p>distribution of food assistance to the district of Insiza </p><p>on December 16, 2002. WFP had suspended general </p><p>distribution of food assistance following the seizure and </p><p>improper distribution of 3.6 metric tons (MT) of food </p><p>(consisting of maize) by pro-ZANU-PF supporters in the ru </p><p>up to the October parliamentary bi-election in Insiza. </p><p>After receiving assurances from the Government of Zimbabw </p><p>(GOZ) that there would be no further manipulation of food </p><p>assistance, WFP made the determination to resume </p><p>distribution (see reftel).  This round of renewed general </p><p>food distributions to Insiza are expected to be completed </p><p>by December 21, 2002, with a total of 9,088 households </p><p>receiving assistance.  A total of 640 MT food assistance </p><p>including 530 MT of maize meal, is to be distributed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The FFPO visited Insiza district on December 18, 2002 </p><p>to monitor the resumption of food distribution and to </p><p>ensure that no manipulation of food assistance was taking </p><p>place.  In the village of Lubuze, the FFPO observed the </p><p>distribution of some 135 MT of maize meal, beans, and cor </p><p>soy blend (CSB) to 1,115 beneficiary households.  Due to </p><p>pipeline shortages, no vegetable oil was provided for </p><p>distribution.  Because the October food distribution to </p><p>Insiza was suspended before all wards received assistanc </p><p>three final delivery points (FDPs), including Lubuze, hav </p><p>not received WFP food assistance distribution since </p><p>September.  WFP made the determination to give these thr </p><p>FDPs a double distribution during December.  Therefore, </p><p>Lubuze, the beneficiaries were each receiving 20 kilogra </p><p>(KG) maize meal, 2 kg beans, and 1 kg CSB.  According to </p><p>WFP ration standards, each beneficiary household can </p><p>receive food assistance for a maximum of five individual </p><p> Thus, a household with eight members receives the same </p><p>allocation as a household with five members. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The actual distribution to the 1,115 households in t </p><p>Lubuze catchment area was conducted by ORAP efficiently </p><p>quickly.  Unfortunately, because 75 percent of the maize </p><p>meal was delivered to the FDP several hours late, most o </p><p>                                          . </p><p> </p><p>the beneficiaries were forced to wait much of the day or </p><p>the distribution to begin.  ORP conducted group </p><p>distributions, whereby households with five or more </p><p>beneficiaries were separated into groups of ten.  Each </p><p>group was then allocated twenty 50 KG </p><p> sacks of maize mea </p><p>two 50 KG sacks of beans, and two 25 KG bags of CSB.  The </p><p>actual allocation to each individual household was </p><p>conducted by each group.  Use of the group distribution </p><p>method greatly reduced the time needed for individual </p><p>distributions.  Beneficiaries with fewer than five family </p><p>members received individual distributions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>GMB FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The FFPO conducted two informal focus group interview </p><p>with the waiting beneficiaries in Lubuze and a household </p><p>survey in the neighboring ward of Sidzibe.  These groups </p><p>reported that there had been no government maize </p><p>distributions through the Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board </p><p>(GMB) since the October bi-election.  In order to receiv </p><p>GMB maize distributions, both groups and the individual </p><p>household reported that they registered for the GMB </p><p>distributions with their village heads, and then </p><p>distribution was made on a first-come, first-served basi </p><p>to those who had the money to buy.  They also reported t </p><p>the maize distributed by GMB only covered about 20 perce </p><p>of the households.  Upon being asked directly whether th </p><p>had been any political manipulation of the GMB maize, al </p><p>responded that there had not been.  They reported that t </p><p>GMB controlled price during the October distribution was </p><p>500 Zimbabwean dollars per 50 KG sack of maize.  The </p><p>current local (black) market price of maize meal was </p><p>reported as 1,600 Zimbabwean dollars for 20 kg, which is </p><p>much lower than in other districts, where 20 kg can run </p><p>high as 4,000 Zimbabwean dollars. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>CONTINUED DROUGHT UNDERMINES FOOD SECURITY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  The villagers reported that there had not been any </p><p>rains in almost two months.  While driving through Insiz </p><p>district, the FFPO noted that there was very little grou </p><p>vegetation and that most fields had not yet been planted </p><p>The few cattle seen walking through the villages were </p><p>noticeably thin, with their ribs very pronounced.  No on </p><p>in either focus group reported that they had planted yet </p><p>this year due to the lack of rain.  Everyone reported th </p><p>they had received seed maize from the GMB during October </p><p>and had just received sorghum and cow pea distributions </p><p>from World Vision.  The villagers reported that if rains </p><p>begin, they would still be able to plant through the end </p><p>January.  All villagers expected that they would remain </p><p>dependent on food assistance from WFP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The villagers reported that cattle were dying at an </p><p>alarming rate due to lack of food.  All villagers that t </p><p>FFPO spoke with reported that they had each lost cattle, </p><p>and that as many as 20 per day were dying throughout the </p><p>neighboring wards. They also reported that the sales pri </p><p>of the cattle had dropped dramatically, to about 10,000 </p><p>Zimbabwean dollars, down from about 80,000, because the </p><p>cattle were so thin and wasted.
