<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IIP/G/WHA (CBARONE; GLLOYD); IIP/T/SV; WHA/PDA </p><p>(MBUCKLEY); INL/PC (RTHOMPSON) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, SNAR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF U.S. SPEAKER FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH, </p><p>DENNIS WATLINGTON, TRACKER #18210 </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 361 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Dennis Watlington, March 1-10, 2003.  Post celebrated </p><p>Black History Month (African-American Heritage Month) </p><p>through film showings, meetings with youth about the </p><p>possibility of a productive life following recovery from </p><p>drug use and gang violence, and discussions of cultural, </p><p>historical and social contributions of African-Americans to </p><p>American society.  Impact was outstanding. The universities </p><p>provided the venues for their programs. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Filmmaker, writer, actor and director Dennis Watlington </p><p>is a tireless speaker who tailored his presentations </p><p>according to the audience, interspersing the showings of his </p><p>Emmy Award-winning documentary, "The Untold West: The Black </p><p>West," with anecdotes from his own life from Harlem to </p><p>Hollywood to deliver the message that "poverty and drugs are </p><p>not a death sentence, but a lack of education is."  He </p><p>presented his audiences in nine different program venues and </p><p>four cities with a new perspective on Black History, </p><p>discussing the role played by slaves and freed Black </p><p>Americans in settling and developing the West, speaking </p><p>along the way with academic and cultural contacts, </p><p>representatives of Garifuna (Afro-Honduran) NGOs, students </p><p>and professors from the English Departments at two </p><p>universities, the media, the general public and local </p><p>filmmakers and reaching thousands during his six-day </p><p>program.  The highlight of his program was meetings with </p><p>hundreds of young people, among them high school students, </p><p>recovering drug addicts and former gang members, and young </p><p>leaders from Garifuna and other North Coast communities who </p><p>are working as mentors with kids at risk in their </p><p>communities.  During these inspiring programs, Mr. </p><p>Watlington talked about his personal story of recovery from </p><p>drug addiction and an early adolescence spent in gangs.  His </p><p>extremely warm personality, openness and good humor made the </p><p>audience frequently interrupt with applause and more than </p><p>made up for his lack of Spanish.  He is an articulate, </p><p>dedicated, engaging and hard-working man, who devoted </p><p>tremendous energy and thought to bringing a message of the </p><p>benefits of diversity and the possibility of hope through </p><p>education to his audiences, commenting more than once that </p><p>this was an "I\'m proud to be an American" moment.  The Post </p><p>wholeheartedly recommends him for future programming. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PAS Tegucigalpa thanks CAO David McGuire in PAS Managua </p><p>for suggesting Dennis Watlington as a speaker and appreciate </p><p>the usual excellent work of IIP/G/WHA Camille Barone and </p><p>Gloria Lloyd in facilitating financial arrangements. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
