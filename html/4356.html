<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>GENEVA FOR WTO DEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, JO, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN GPA ACCESSION UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary:  Jordan has nearly completed its initial </p><p>Entity Offer for accession into the WTO\'s plurilateral </p><p>Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).  While a few hurdles </p><p>remain, including settling on the all-important offsets in </p><p>the General Notes of the Offer, the GOJ is certain it will </p><p>meet its initial commitment to WTO delegations in Geneva to </p><p>have their Offer presented by the end of 2002.  GPA Progress </p><p>would be a fitting topic for discussion at the December 11 </p><p>Joint Commission meeting in Washington.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Jordanian Trade Ministry officials confirmed </p><p>November 7 that they are 80% finished with their initial </p><p>Entity Offer to accede to the WTO\'s Government Procurement </p><p>Agreement (GPA).  They admit that the most daunting task - </p><p>completing the General Notes and agreeing with affected </p><p>private sector elements on offsets - still lies ahead.  To </p><p>this end, the GOJ will chair a final meeting of the GPA </p><p>National Committee, a public-private sector group that has </p><p>been hammering out positions that address private-sector </p><p>entities\' particular concerns about opening their sectors to </p><p>competition.  MoIT officials hope to get from this meeting a </p><p>final list of offset requests.  Once that has been </p><p>accomplished, the draft Entity offer with the National </p><p>Committee\'s endorsement will be sent to the cabinet for </p><p>approval.  MoIT officials said there would be "no problem" </p><p>passing the Offer through the cabinet, and expressed </p><p>confidence they would be able to submit a formal offer well </p><p>in time to meet their original commitment to the WTO </p><p>committee of a year-end submission. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  In a related effort to make national legislation </p><p>compatible with GPA accession, Jordan\'s Government Tenders </p><p>Directorate recently hired an independent legal expert to </p><p>redraft the February 2002 draft Public Procurement Law into a </p><p>regulation and instructions.  The redraft, it is hoped, will </p><p>bring Jordan\'s current procurement regime more in line with </p><p>its expected obligations as a GPA member. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Comment:  Trade ministry officials tell us Jordan\'s </p><p>efforts to date have won praise from a number of delegations </p><p>in Geneva.  As Jordan\'s self-imposed deadline for submission </p><p>of its Entity Offer approaches, it might be useful to add GPA </p><p>issues to the agenda for the Joint Commission meeting </p><p>scheduled for December 11 in Washington.  Should the offer be </p><p>presented before then, the parties could discuss next steps </p><p>and find out what sort of technical assistance Jordan can be </p><p>expected to request for the negotiations process.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
