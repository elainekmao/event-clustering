<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 001054 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, MARR, MOPS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN PLANNING TEAM VISIT HIGHLIGHTS NEED </p><p>FOR STRENGTHENED UN/GOJ COORDINATION AND LOW-KEY CIV-MIL </p><p>COORDINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 40450 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 253 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  During a February 2-3 visit to Amman, </p><p>members of the interagency Humanitarian Planning Team (HPT) </p><p>met with GOJ Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaher </p><p>Al-Bak, JAF Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence Major </p><p>General Mohamed-Majed Al-Eitan, the UN country team and the </p><p>Hashemite Charitable Organization.  In addition to briefing </p><p>GOJ and UN interlocutors on the USG\'s regional humanitarian </p><p>contingency plan (reported ref a), the HPT also discussed key </p><p>difficulties in Jordan\'s humanitarian planning in the event </p><p>of hostilities.  Coordination between the UN and GOJ is being </p><p>held up by GOJ financial requirements; GOJ operational </p><p>planning is dominated by the military and does not yet have </p><p>agreed mechanisms for dealing with the UN and NGO community; </p><p>and the USG is still working to establish an appropriate </p><p>civil-military coordination mechanism in Jordan, where most </p><p>NGOs plan to base their regional operations.  Although the </p><p>GOJ was initially receptive to the possibility of setting up </p><p>a joint USG-GOJ humanitarian operations center, the GOJ later </p><p>informed post it could not participate in such a center due </p><p>to political sensitivities.  Similarly, although the GOJ has </p><p>pledged that it would facilitate cross-border relief </p><p>operations into Iraq, it has declined to discuss specific </p><p>arrangements with the UN due to political sensitivities. </p><p>Despite these significant obstacles to smooth planning and </p><p>implementation, we are confident that the Jordanians are </p><p>serious and committed to dealing with these critical </p><p>humanitarian issues.  Embassy Amman will continue to work </p><p>with the GOJ, UN and CENTCOM to address these issues.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Humanitarian Planning Team Delegation included: </p><p> PRM PDAS Rich Greene; Andy Wyllie, PRM/ANE; Helmut Reda, </p><p>USMission Geneva/RMA, David Tarantino, OSD; Roger Corneretto, </p><p>JCS; Major Ray Eiriz, CENTCOM.  USAID/OFDA Disaster </p><p>Assistance Response Team members Guy Lawson and David Hajjar </p><p>also accompanied the team on its meetings, as did Amman-based </p><p>Regional Refugee Coordinator and Amman\'s USAID Mission </p><p>Director.  The DCM and representatives from Amman\'s Defense </p><p>Attache Office also joined some meetings. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Minister of State for Foreign Affairs:  GOJ </p><p>Needs Funds Now; Wants Help in NGO Screening </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In a February 2 meeting, GOJ Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs (and chair of the GOJ\'s Ministerial-level </p><p>emergency preparedness policy committee) Shaher Al-Bak told </p><p>the HPT that, in the event of hostilities in Iraq, the GOJ </p><p>would allow a certain number of Iraqi refugees to enter </p><p>Jordan on "humanitarian grounds."  However, Bak cautioned </p><p>that the international community must find a way to cover all </p><p>financial costs related to any new refugee flows.  Jordan had </p><p>spent large sums of its own money to provide financial </p><p>assistance to refugees and TCNs during the 1990-91 Gulf </p><p>crisis and could not afford to do the same thing again. </p><p>Greene responded that the U.S. recognizes there would be </p><p>major financial needs in the event of hostilities in Iraq and </p><p>has identified the resource requirements needed to replace </p><p>the USD 400-500 million currently entering Iraq through the </p><p>oil-for-food program.  More immediately, the U.S. had just </p><p>approved a USD 15 million drawdown of emergency humanitarian </p><p>assistance funding that would allow UN agencies to </p><p>preposition relief supplies; USAID had also provided another </p><p>USD 10 million for similar purposes.  The U.S. was also </p><p>asking other nations to do the same. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Explaining that a "huge" number of NGOs currently </p><p>seek permission to operate in Jordan -- both to provide </p><p>assistance to new refugee populations here and as a basis for </p><p>cross-border operations inside Iraq -- Bak asked for the </p><p>USG\'s assistance in screening NGOs.  Although the GOJ will </p><p>set up procedures for expedited registration of new NGOs, it </p><p>will need assistance in verifying NGOs\' references, goals and </p><p>bona fides.  Greene responded that the Disaster Assistance </p><p>Response Team (DART) could play a helpful role in providing </p><p>references and additional background on NGOs seeking to work </p><p>in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Security Needs Will Remain Paramount </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Bak also emphasized that the GOJ\'s security needs </p><p>will remain paramount in any humanitarian crisis.  The GOJ </p><p>will conduct a security check on every person who seeks </p><p>refuge in Jordan.  Some individuals, such as diplomats and </p><p>documented citizens of the U.S. and European nations, would </p><p>be easier to admit than others.  Emphasizing that Jordan </p><p>cannot afford to take security risks, Bak hinted that </p><p>"certain groups" would be denied entry entirely.  Greene </p><p>urged the GOJ to conduct security checks as quickly as </p><p>possible, noting that there is a direct link between </p><p>provision of humanitarian assistance and overall stability. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Crisis Management Center:  Planning for </p><p>TCNs and Refugees, With Security Screening </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) General Mohamed-Majed Al-Eitan briefed the HPT </p><p>February 2 on the GOJ\'s plans to establish a border screening </p><p>facility and two camps (one for TCNs and another for </p><p>refugees, each with a capacity of 25,000) at Ruweished, </p><p>approximately 75 km from the Iraqi border, in the event of </p><p>hostilities in Iraq.  Should events warrant, the GOJ also had </p><p>developed contingency plans to establish a camp for Iraqi </p><p>asylum seekers and disarmed Iraqi soldiers at Nadayim </p><p>airbase, just inside Iraqi territory.  (Details of plan </p><p>reported ref b.)  Echoing comments made by Minister of State </p><p>Shaher Al-Bak, Al-Eitan emphasized that Jordan needed </p><p>financial help in order to respond to a new refugee crisis. </p><p>Although the GOJ had held meetings with the UN and NGOs, no </p><p>financial assistance from these organizations was yet </p><p>forthcoming.  The Jordan Armed Forces (JAF) already had spent </p><p>50,000 JD (roughly USD 70,000) on preparations for a refugee </p><p>influx and needed new resources in order to continue its </p><p>preparations.  The JAF wanted to establish a camp for 5,000 </p><p>refugees in order to be able to respond appropriately in the </p><p>first 36-48 hours of any crisis but could not do so without </p><p>funding.  Al-Eitan hoped to finalize funding arrangements </p><p>through a still-to-be-signed framework agreement with UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Al-Eitan told the HPT that GOJ security needs would </p><p>remain paramount in the event of a refugee crisis.  The GOJ </p><p>expects a number of Iraqi military forces posted near the </p><p>border to surrender immediately but, for security reasons, </p><p>the GOJ will not allow any Iraqi soldiers to enter Jordan. </p><p>Referring explicitly to Mujahadeen El-Khalq militants, </p><p>Al-Eitan added that some other nationalities also would not </p><p>be allowed to enter Jordan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Cross Border Operations Dependent on </p><p>Iraqi Agreement, at least in Initial Stages </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Al-Eitan told Greene that, although the GOJ had a </p><p>strong interest in facilitating the provision of humanitarian </p><p>assistance inside Iraq, the GOJ at least in the initial </p><p>stages of a conflict would not be able to do anything inside </p><p>Iraq without the approval of the Iraqi government.  In the </p><p>event of regime change or collapse, however, the GOJ "will do </p><p>everything" to ensure provision of relief from Jordanian </p><p>territory.  Greene emphasized that rapid provision of </p><p>humanitarian assistance inside Iraq would be key to </p><p>maintaining stability inside Iraq and hence minimizing the </p><p>displacement of Iraq\'s civilian population.  Even before any </p><p>change in regime, for example, the World Food Program likely </p><p>would need authorization to trans-ship food assistance </p><p>through Jordan.  Al-Eitan agreed but again noted that the GOJ </p><p>could not infringe on Iraq\'s sovereign authority as long as </p><p>that authority remained intact.  He suggested that </p><p>coordination of cross-border humanitarian assistance under </p><p>the auspices of the Jordan and Iraq Red Crescent Societies </p><p>could be a useful approach. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>GOJ Ready to Facilitate USG Humanitarian Assistance </p><p>But Civ-Mil Coordination Must be Low-Profile </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Al-Eitan told the HPT that he had been given </p><p>instructions from "the most senior levels" to provide all </p><p>necessary assistance and cooperation to U.S. Government </p><p>humanitarian assistance efforts.  He noted specifically that </p><p>the DART\'s humanitarian assistance would be granted duty-free </p><p>status both into and out of Jordan and offered to provide </p><p>prefabricated storage space near the camp sites at Ruweished. </p><p> General Al-Eitan asked that the US Government provide a </p><p>liaison officer at both the JAF HQ and at the crisis </p><p>management center\'s planned HQ at Ruweished.  HPT members </p><p>suggested that a more robust coordination mechanism, similar </p><p>to the planned Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait, </p><p>would be more helpful than a sole liaison officer.  Al-Eitan </p><p>asked his staff officers to hold a follow-on discussion with </p><p>the HPT on February 3. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) At the February 3 follow-on meeting, Al-Eitan\'s </p><p>staff officers suggested that the Hashemite Charitable </p><p>Organization (HCO), in its role as overall humanitarian </p><p>coordinator for the GOJ, would be the best partner for a </p><p>joint US-GOJ coordination structure.  The HPT then held a </p><p>separate meeting with HCO President Prince Rashid, where the </p><p>HPT explained the US-GOK Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) </p><p>and discussed ways in which a similar organization could be </p><p>established in Jordan under the auspices of the HCO. </p><p>Although Prince Rashid initially seemed receptive to the </p><p>idea, he informed USAID Mission Director and DART members on </p><p>February 4 that the HCO would not be able to host any USG </p><p>military presence.  The Prince said that the HCO Board of </p><p>Trustees would not accept a US military presence "of any </p><p>form" due to the Society\'s relationship with other Arab </p><p>nations, who are key donors and also rely on the HCO to </p><p>transport donated goods to the West Bank and Gaza.  Prince </p><p>Rashid emphasized that the HCO Board cannot allow the </p><p>organization to be seen as in any way connected to the US </p><p>military, as such a relationship would jeopardize the </p><p>organization\'s role in Jordan as a neutral, charitable </p><p>society.  (Comment:  Political sensitivities in Jordan may </p><p>limit our ability to facilitate civ-mil coordination along </p><p>the lines of the HOC in Kuwait.  One short-term solution </p><p>could be for the UN to host a daily civ-mil briefing with US </p><p>military participation.  We will work with the UN, CENTCOM </p><p>and the GOJ to set up an initial coordination mechanism that </p><p>is agreeable to all and will develop plans for making this </p><p>more robust as times goes by.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>UN Country Team:  Focused on TCNs </p><p>But Also Planning for Refugees </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) UN Resident Coordinator Christine McNab told the HPT </p><p>that movement of third-country nationals (mostly Egyptians </p><p>and Sudanese) from Iraq would be the UN\'s biggest </p><p>responsibility in Jordan in the event of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> Jordan is the usual gateway for Egyptian and Sudanese </p><p>laborers traveling to Iraq and the Gulf and the UN fully </p><p>expects that they would seek to return through Jordan in the </p><p>event of a crisis.  IOM is planning to repatriate up to </p><p>60,000 TCNs, by sea (ferry service from Aqaba, Jordan to </p><p>Nuweibeh, Egypt) and by air.  IOM estimates that up to 50,000 </p><p>Egyptians will seek repatriation through Jordan; while the </p><p>remaining 10,000 will represent a mix of Sudanese, Eritrean, </p><p>Ethiopian, Somali and various South Asian citizens. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) McNab reported that UN planning figures for refugee </p><p>flows toward Jordan are far less certain, as would-be </p><p>refugees likely would be able to find easier routes out of </p><p>Iraq but those routes may not be accessible during </p><p>hostilities.  The UN is using 35,000 refugees as its initial </p><p>planning figure.  Yet given GOJ concerns about internal </p><p>stability and security, UNHCR is quite concerned about </p><p>refugee access to Jordan.  UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee </p><p>reported that the GOJ has made it very clear that </p><p>"undesirables" such as Iraqi soldiers or Iranian militants </p><p>would not be welcome in Jordan.  UNHCR plans to provide </p><p>assistance to Iraqis held at the border who are denied entry </p><p>to Jordan but has not been able to clarify who would have </p><p>overall responsibility for the security of this area and </p><p>these would-be refugees. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>UN-GOJ Coordination Complicated </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The UN country team reported that humanitarian </p><p>planning coordination within and with the GOJ is not </p><p>consistent.  While Minister of State Shaher Al-Bak is </p><p>responsible for policy-level decisions, Minister of Planning </p><p>Bassam Awadallah is responsible for securing funds for any </p><p>GOJ humanitarian efforts -- a mandate that has proved a major </p><p>obstacle to further GOJ preparations, pending a pledge of </p><p>funds from the UN.  (UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee later </p><p>told refcoord that the UN would be unable to pledge funds to </p><p>the GOJ, as none of the USD 15 million given by the US to </p><p>UNHCR for preparations has been turned over to local UNHCR </p><p>offices.)  The Jordan Armed Forces\' Crisis Management Center, </p><p>led by General Al-Eitan, is responsible for operationalizing </p><p>the GOJ\'s plan, but according to the UN is not driving the </p><p>process consistently.  The UN\'s key challenge, according to </p><p>McNab, is how to encourage the GOJ to serve as a focal point </p><p>for relief agencies and NGOs seeking to provide assistance in </p><p>Jordan and use Jordan as a base for relief operations inside </p><p>Iraq.  OCHA Representative Daniel Augstburger noted that most </p><p>NGOs seeking to work in and from Jordan have no legal </p><p>presence here and that an expedited GOJ registration process </p><p>is therefore essential.  In addition, the GOJ needs to </p><p>delegate some coordination responsibilities from the </p><p>Jordanian military to an appropriate (and sufficiently </p><p>strong) civilian ministry. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Assurances But No Detail </p><p>on Cross-Border Operations </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) McNab reported that GOJ Prime Minister Ali Abul </p><p>Ragheb provided assurances to both UNDP and UNHCR that the </p><p>GOJ would facilitate the provision of cross-border assistance </p><p>into Iraq.  However, given GOJ sensitivities about its </p><p>political relationship with Iraq, the GOJ has not yet </p><p>provided a detailed plan for the UN to actually deliver </p><p>cross-border assistance.  As the GOJ has a strong </p><p>self-interest in maintaining stability inside Iraq, the UN is </p><p>confident that the GOJ will in fact allow cross-border relief </p><p>operations.  But the lack of a concrete plan could pose major </p><p>logistics problems if there is any break in the UN\'s </p><p>Oil-for-Food pipeline. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Jordan Crucial Transport Corridor </p><p>for UN Staff in Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Finally, the UN country team in Jordan also has </p><p>responsibility for the safe evacuation of 900 international </p><p>UN staff from Iraq.  The UN hopes that it would have adequate </p><p>notice before the beginning of hostilities in order to </p><p>evacuate staff overland through Jordan.  Should the UN not </p><p>have sufficient notice, it would be required to evacuate its </p><p>staff by air.  McNab noted that if there were any use of </p><p>chemical or biological weapons inside Iraq, the UN would </p><p>require U.S. military assistance in order to return its staff </p><p>and restart its programs. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) PRM/ANE cleared this message for the HPT. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
