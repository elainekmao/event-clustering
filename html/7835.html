<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002903 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: FRIENDSHIP AND FEAR IN RURAL ANKARA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In conversations at all levels during April </p><p>visits to Ankara sub-provinces, poloffs encountered Turks </p><p>eager to get U.S.-Turkish relations back on track. </p><p>Nevertheless, we also noted the kind of suspicion and doubt </p><p>from State authorities about the purpose of our trips that we </p><p>normally encounter in the more sensitive Southeast.  Although </p><p>we expect a certain level of natural curiosity, the extent of </p><p>official wariness seems especially noteworthy given that </p><p>these trips occurred so close to cosmopolitan Ankara.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloffs have recently made trips to Ankara </p><p>sub-provinces to engage local officials in open discussions </p><p>about U.S.-Turkish relations and Turkish domestic politics. </p><p>Visits included: sub-provinces in the Ankara conurbation; </p><p>Kazan, a town of some 15,000 people, who rely on primarily </p><p>agriculture to sustain the local economy; and Kizilcahamam, a </p><p>poor, insular, conservative community capitalizing on nearby </p><p>natural springs to grow its tourism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Eager to reaffirm U.S.-Turkey ties </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In our visits to Kazan and Kizilcahamam, Turks at all </p><p>levels -- from police chiefs and village leaders to </p><p>sub-provincial governors (kaymakam) and teachers -- displayed </p><p>a genuine affinity toward the U.S. and a desire to get </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations back on track.  We had lively, open </p><p>discussions across the board with the mayors, both of whom </p><p>are members of the ultranationalist MHP, normally suspicious </p><p>of the U.S.  They blamed the media for creating and </p><p>perpetuating any anti-U.S. sentiment in Turkey during the war </p><p>in Iraq.  Both regretted that Turkey had not been part of the </p><p>coalition.  During lunch in a small Kazan village, the local </p><p>muhtar (village leader), imam, and the leader of the village </p><p>elders all spoke positively of Turkey\'s long friendship with </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a chance meeting, the Kazan police chief, who had </p><p>spent 3 years in the U.S. as bodyguard to then-ambassador and </p><p>current MFA Deputy U/S Baki Ilkin, was eager to praise the </p><p>U.S., noting that he had seen real democracy in America.  He </p><p>also praised the law enforcement system in the U.S., which, </p><p>he said, demonstrates a level of politeness and flexibility </p><p>alien to the Turkish system.  We witnessed his influence </p><p>first hand.  While speaking with vendors at a vegetable </p><p>market, we ran into a uniformed police officer, doing his own </p><p>shopping, who then invited us for tea and arranged the </p><p>meeting with the police chief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Old Habits Die Hard </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Although we encountered an overwhelmingly pro-U.S. </p><p>attitude from the man on the street, we were struck by the </p><p>high level of State suspicion concerning the purpose of our </p><p>visits and our planned agenda.  The Kazan kaymakam, for </p><p>example, claimed he had to notify the Interior Ministry, </p><p>Foreign Ministry, and the Turkish National Intelligence </p><p>Organization before agreeing to meet with us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Our conversation with the garrulous Kazan mayor was </p><p>quickly interrupted by an Interior Ministry inspector, who </p><p>happened to be in town.  After seizing control of the </p><p>meeting, he took the opportunity to deride U.S. Iraq policy. </p><p>In a subsequent conversation, the mayor apologized for having </p><p>to defer to the inspector and, using a very crude phrase, </p><p>explained that his hands had been tied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In Kizilcahamam, the kaymakam was alternately helpful </p><p>in terms of arranging meetings and extremely nervous about </p><p>our agenda -- to the point of visibly shaking in our meeting </p><p>with him.  He questioned our motives in meeting with local </p><p>political party offices and made sure that the sub-provincial </p><p>police chief accompanied us to every location. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In planning an upcoming trip to Haymana, a </p><p>sub-province south of Ankara proper, the local kaymakam tried </p><p>to dictate which villages we could visit.  Wanting some </p><p>insight into villages which have long been inhabited by </p><p>Kurds, we indicated to the kaymakam that we intended to visit </p><p>two Kurdish villages.  He angrily claimed that they are </p><p>"centers of separatist activities" -- 50 kilometers from </p><p>Ankara -- and tried to suggest another village that would be </p><p>"safer." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Our trips served to reaffirm that even close to Ankara </p><p>there is a fundamental gap in Turkey.  On the one hand are </p><p>ordinary citizens who, although pious and conservative, are </p><p>very warm toward Americans.  On the other hand are the </p><p>representatives of the Turkish State (sub-provincial </p><p>governors), who continue to be stiff and wary toward </p><p>outsiders. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
