(U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: UAE Ministry of Health Director </p><p>of Drug Control Department Dr. Easa Al-Mansouri provided </p><p>Econoff a read-out on January 11 of the GCC Health Ministers </p><p>Conference last week in Abu Dhabi.  The ministers discussed </p><p>a variety of issues, including the impact of international </p><p>trade agreements on the development of a regional </p><p>pharmaceutical industry.  Al-Mansouri assured Econoff that </p><p>the UAE, along with the smaller Gulf countries, is standing </p><p>firm against Saudi pressure to mandate registration of </p><p>pharmaceuticals through the GCC Patent Office in Riyadh. </p><p>The UAEG is well aware that caving on this issue would </p><p>probably cause it to contravene its WTO obligations.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The registration of drugs in the region was the most </p><p>controversial item on the conference agenda, according to </p><p>Al-Mansouri.  The Saudis apparently are eager to make </p><p>compulsory the registration of all pharmaceuticals through </p><p>the GCC Patent Office in Riyadh.  Al-Mansouri noted that the </p><p>other GCC Ministers refused Riyadh\'s request because of </p><p>differences between Saudi and the rest-of-Gulf levels of IPR </p><p>protection.  Al-Mansouri admitted that companies would </p><p>benefit by registering a product one time for six countries, </p><p>but noted that "no American company would be so stupid" to </p><p>expect that UAE levels of protection, for example, would </p><p>extend to Saudi Arabia through the GCC registration </p><p>mechanism. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The ministers also debated the unification of drug </p><p>prices throughout the GCC.  According to Al-Mansouri, most </p><p>local manufacturers of generics are permitted to charge </p><p>consumers 70-80 percent of the market price of the </p><p>innovative product.  Prices of pharmaceuticals produced in </p><p>Saudi Arabia, however, are much higher.  Currently, the GCC </p><p>registers only Arab generics -- locally manufactured </p><p>products -- but will begin registration of innovative </p><p>products this year.  "This is the plan," said Al-Mansouri, </p><p>"but its success depends on Saudi Arabia joining the WTO and </p><p>getting serious about patent protection for </p><p>pharmaceuticals." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As an aside, Al-Mansouri confirmed that a total of </p><p>four local pharmaceutical manufacturers would be operational </p><p>in the UAE by the end of 2003 -- Julphar in Ras Al Khaimah, </p><p>GlobalPharm in Dubai, and one each in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. </p><p>Al-Mansouri noted that all factories would produce garden- </p><p>variety generic antibiotics or repackage imported drugs for </p><p>the local market. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
