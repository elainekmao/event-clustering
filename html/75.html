<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 04824 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, EI, IN </p><p>SUBJECT:  AIRLINE BOMBINGS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR ROBINSON OPENED HIS CALL TODAY ON DR. FRED </p><p>DOUCET, SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR FOR THE CANADIAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF U.S. SYMPATHY AND CONCERN </p><p>OVER THE TRAGIC AIRLINE INCIDENTS THIS PAST WEEKEND. </p><p>(THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS </p><p>ON OTHER SUBJECTS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER.) </p><p>REPORTS ON THE EXPLOSION OF THE AIR INDIA BOEING 747 </p><p>OFF THE COAST OF IRELAND, THE GREATEST LOSS OF CANADIAN </p><p>LIVES IN COMMERCIAL FLYING HISTORY, AND THE EXPLOSION </p><p>OF A BOMB HIDDEN IN THE LUGGAGE OF A CP AIR FLIGHT TO </p><p>TOKYO, DOMINATE TODAY\'S CANADIAN PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  DR. DOUCET EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE AMBASSADOR\' </p><p>STATEMENT OF CONCERN IN BEHALF OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HE MADE THREE POINTS IN RESPONSE.  FIRST, HE SAID THAT </p><p>"THE TARGETS FOR THE BOMBINGS WERE NOT CLEAR AND CLEAN," </p><p>GIVEN THE VARIED BACKGROUND OF THE PASSENGERS.  THE GOC </p><p>CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SIKH TERRORISTS, IF THEY ARE IN </p><p>FACT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENTS, WOULD HAVE CHOSEN </p><p>THIS UNTARGETTED MEANS TO MAKE A POLITICAL POINT. </p><p>SECOND, DOUCET SAID THAT "SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN </p><p>ORCHESTRATED" SINCE IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT TWO SUCH </p><p>INCIDENTS COULD TAKE PLACE BY COINCIDENCE WITHIN TWELVE </p><p>HOURS.  THIRD, HE SAID THAT ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE </p><p>DOES POINT TO USE OF A BOMB ON AIR INDIA 182. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  WHEN ASKED BY THE ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR WHAT TH </p><p>GOC PLANS TO DO IN FOLLOWING UP ON THESE APPARENT </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS, DR. DOUCET SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY CONVENE A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE </p><p>CANADIAN CABINET FOR LATER TODAY.  (THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>IS NOW AT HIS SUMMER RESIDENCE ABOUT 20 MINUTES OUTSIDE </p><p>OTTAWA.)  ACCORDING TO DOUCET, PRIME MINISTER MULRONEY </p><p>WILL PROBABLY USE THAT CABINET MEETING TO REVIEW THE </p><p>EVENTS OF THE WEEKEND AND OPTIONS FOR ACTION.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT MULRONEY MIGHT ISSUE A STRONG STATEMENT, INDICATING </p><p>THAT, AS DOUCET PUT IT, "CANADA WILL NOT TAKE THIS </p><p>KIND OF ATTACK SITTING DOWN" AND THAT THE GOC WILL TAKE </p><p>STERN ACTION.  WHAT ACTION, DOUCET DID NOT AND COULD NOT </p><p>INDICATE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD </p><p>SEEK TO REASSURE THE CANADIAN PUBLIC THAT THE GOC HAS </p><p>TIGHTENED AIRPORT SECURITY AND THAT CANADIANS SHOULD </p><p>MAINTAIN THEIR TRAVEL PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  DR. DOUCET CALLED THE ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY EARLY AFTERNOON, JUNE 24, TO CONFIRM THAT </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER WILL INDEED MEET WITH KEY MINISTERS </p><p>TODAY AT 3 P.M. AND MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AT 4 P.M. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT PRECISE INFORMATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE </p><p>APPARENT EXPLOSION ABOARD AIR INDIA 182 REMAINS SKETCHY, </p><p>BUT THAT THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A </p><p>CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FATE OF THAT AIRLINE AND THE </p><p>BOMB EXPLODED AT TOKYO\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. </p><p> </p><p>ROBINSON </p><p></p></div>
