<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000685 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIAN PARLIAMENT DEBATES IRAQ: NO </p><p>SURPRISES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 669 </p><p> </p><p>    1.  ON MARCH 26, CROATIA\'S PARLIAMENT DEBATED THE GOC </p><p>POSITION ON IRAQ.  DEBATE WAS LIMITED BY A STRUCTURE AGREED </p><p>IN ADVANCE BY PARLIAMENT LEADERS ON MARCH 21.  AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF "QUESTION TIME," PM RACAN DELIVERED A BRIEF </p><p>REPORT; PARTY LEADERS THEN HAD FIVE MINUTES EACH TO RESPOND. </p><p>PM RACAN\'S "REPORT" TRACKED CLOSELY WITH THE POSITION HE </p><p>RELAYED PRIVATELY TO THE AMBASSADOR IN THEIR MARCH 24 MEETING </p><p>(REFTEL).  RACAN REPEATED HIS EXPRESSION OF "REGRET" AT THE </p><p>LACK OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY UNITY OVER IRAQ.  HE PUBLICLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S READINESS TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, PEACEKEEPING AND POST-WAR </p><p>RENEWAL OF IRAQ.  RACAN CALLED FOR A "REVITALIZATION" OF UN </p><p>AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND SAID THAT THE UN SHOULD </p><p>HAVE THE LEAD IN REBUILDING IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2.  LEADERS OF COALITION PARTIES GENERALLY BACKED THE GOC. </p><p>VESNA PUSIC (HNS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH </p><p>DEVELOPING AND THEN STICKING TO A CONSISTENT POSITION. </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE USG HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED; THE ONLY </p><p>IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WAS CROATIA\'S DECISION NOT TO BE LISTED </p><p>AS A MEMBER OF THE COALITION SUPPORTING MILITARY ACTION IN </p><p>IRAQ.  JOZO RADOS (LIBRA) SAID THAT THE LOCAL MEDIA HAS </p><p>EXAGGERATED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGREED GOC LINE AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC\'S SPEECH.  ZLATKO KRAMARIC (LS) SAID </p><p>CROATIA\'S POSITIONS ON THE EU AND THE U.S. MUST BE REDEFINED, </p><p>HOPED THAT THE U.N WOULD NOT REGRESS TO THE LEAGUE OF </p><p>NATIONS, AND HOPED THAT TERRORISM WOULD NOT SPILL OVER TO </p><p>"OUR REGION."  LUKA TRCONIC (HSS) EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>DAMAGE DONE TO THE UN, ON WHICH "SMALL NATIONS LIKE CROATIA" </p><p>RELY. </p><p> </p><p>    3.  THE OPPOSITION REACTION TO THE PM\'S REPORT WAS MIXED. </p><p>THE HDZ -- THE ONLY PARTY TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE TO DISARM IRAQ -- DID NOT USE THEIR RIGHT OF REPLY. </p><p>HDZ WHIP VLADIMIR SEKS SAID HIS PARTY HAD "PUBLICLY SHARED </p><p>ITS VIEWS ON THE IRAQI CRISIS AND HAD NOTHING TO ADD TO ITS </p><p>POSITIONS."  DC PRESIDENT MATE GRANIC CRITICIZED A LACK OF </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT MESIC ON </p><p>IRAQ, WONDERING WHY THE (STILL NOT ESTABLISHED) NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL HAD NOT BEEN USED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. </p><p>GRANIC COMMENDED THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND MOST POLITICAL PARTIES REACHED ON THE NEED OF UNSC </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE MILITARY ACTION.  IDS LEADER DAMIR KAJIN </p><p>ACCUSED PRESIDENT BUSH OF "LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY" AND </p><p>STARTING A "UNILATERAL" ACTION THAT WILL PRODUCE MORE </p><p>ANTI-AMERICANISM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DRAZEN BUDISA (HSLS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD </p><p>RECONSIDER ITS FOREIGN POLICY GOALS IN THE LIGHT OF NEW </p><p>DIVISIONS.  RESPONDING TO RACAN\'S DECLARATION THAT CROATIA </p><p>WOULD SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITIES, BUDISA </p><p>SAID THAT "CROATIA SHOULD NOT BE JOINING THE COUNTRIES WHICH </p><p>WILL REBUILD IRAQ, BUT THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO STOP THE </p><p>WAR."  THE ONLY FIREWORKS OF THE "QUESTION TIME" SESSION WERE </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE HDZ RIGHT-WING EXTREMIST LJUBO CESIC ROJS, </p><p>WHO ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS NOISILY INTERJECTED HIS </p><p>READINESS TO JOIN THE US-LED MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
