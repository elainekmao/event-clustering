(C) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S NEW ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO, APPOINTED DECEMBER 15 AT THE SPECIAL PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS (REF B), STRENGTHENS SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA\'S POSITION IN THE PARTY AND COULD </p><p>SIGNAL MUGABE\'S INTENTION TO MAKE MNANGAGWA HIS </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  SINCE JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, </p><p>MNANGAGWA HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK OF </p><p>POLITICAL EXTINCTION AFTER LOSING HIS LEGISLATIVE SEAT. </p><p>THE NEW POLITBURO ALSO EFFECTIVELY MARGINALIZES THE </p><p>NDEBELE AND MANICA ETHNIC GROUPS, TWO GROUPS </p><p>INCREASINGLY VIEWED IN THE PARTY AS SYMPATHETIC TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC, ACCORDING TO ONE LOCAL POLITICAL </p><p>OBSERVER.  MNANGAGWA, WIDELY FEARED AND DESPISED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, COULD BE AN EVEN MORE REPRESSIVE </p><p>LEADER IF HE TURNS OUT TO BE MUGABE\'S ANNOINTED ONE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUGABE\'S NEWLY APPOINTED RULING PARTY POLITBURO, </p><p>ANNOUNCED DECEMBER 15 AT THE ZANU-PF SPECIAL CONGRESS, </p><p>APPEARS TO FAVOR THE ASCENDANCY OF SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA.  MNANGAGWA, WHO DIRECTED THE CIO AND </p><p>PRESIDED OVER THE MATABELELAND MASSACRES DURING THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07266  01 OF 02  281245Z </p><p>1980S, WAS ON THE BRINK OF POLITICAL OBLIVION EARLIER </p><p>THIS YEAR AFTER HE LOST HIS KWEKWE SEAT IN THE JUNE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS TO THE OBSCURE BLESSING CHEBONDO </p><p>OF THE MDC.  MUGABE RESCUED HIM BY ENSURING HE WAS </p><p>ELECTED SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT IN AUGUST.  MNANGAGWA\'S </p><p>POSITION WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED WITH HIS APPOINTMENT </p><p>TO THE NUMBER FOUR POSITION IN THE PARTY AS SECRETARY </p><p>FOR ADMINISTRATION (ONLY PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THE TWO </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENTS HOLD HIGHER POSITIONS).  MNANGAGWA </p><p>REPLACED DIDYMUS MUTASA, WHO IS CANINELY LOYAL TO </p><p>MNANGAGWA AND WHOSE OWN PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS NOW </p><p>HAVE BEEN SIDELINED.  FROM THIS PLATFORM, MNANGAGWA WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO EXERCISE CONSIDERABLE CONTROL OVER ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>STRUCTURES AND THE PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) STRENGTHENING MNANGAGWA\'S POSITION IN THE NEW </p><p>POLITBURO IS THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS ALLIES TO IMPORTANT </p><p>POSITIONS AND THE SIDELINING OF HIS RIVALS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT," RICHARD HOVE IS AN ALLY OF </p><p>MNANGAGWA\'S FROM HIS HOME MIDLANDS PROVINCE, AND WAS </p><p>MADE SECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.  HOVE WAS ALSO </p><p>APPOINTED TO HEAD UP THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S NEW LAND </p><p>REFORM STANDING COMMITTEE (REF B).  THE "INDEPENDENT" </p><p>DESCRIBES OTHER POLITBURO ALLIES OF THE SPEAKER AS: </p><p>DAVID KARIMANZIRA (MASHONALAND EAST GOVERNOR AND ZANU-PF </p><p>SECRETARY FOR FINANCE), WITNESS MANGWENDE (DEPUTY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION), AND ENOS CHIKOWORE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(SECRETARY FOR LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT).  EACH NOW </p><p>OCCUPIES SOME OF THE POLITBURO\'S MOST CRITICAL PORTFOLIOS, </p><p>AND EACH WAS ELEVATED FROM OBSCURE POSTS IN THE POLITBURO </p><p>STRUCTURE.  THEY ARE ALSO MOSTLY SPENT FORCES KNOWN FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07266  01 OF 02  281245Z </p><p>THEIR STRIDENT AND SHRILL ANTI-WESTERN REMARKS.  (NOTE: </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT IS UNKNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER AND PARTY COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI SUPPORTS </p><p>MNANGAGWA, THE 36-YEAR-OLD GEZI HAS ALL THE MAKINGS OF </p><p>AN MNANGAGWA PROTEGE.  GEZI, AS GOVERNOR OF MASHONALAND </p><p>WEST, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DIRECTING THE TERROR CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS IN HIS PROVINCE EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR, AND HE IS CURRENTLY LEADING A CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE </p><p>IN THE BIKITA WEST CONSTITUENCY FOR THE JANUARY BY- </p><p>ELECTION [REF A].  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA RIVALS, SUCH AS ENERGY MINISTER SYDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI AS SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE, </p><p>AND FORMER ARMY GENERAL SOLOMON MUJURU AS MEMBER WITHOUT </p><p>PORTFOLIO, HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO THE POLITBURO </p><p>PERIPHERY.  ACCORDING TO UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>PROFESSOR BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS, RIVAL EDDISON ZVOBGO WAS </p><p>FORCED OUT OF THE POLITBURO ALTOGETHER AS A WAY TO </p><p>PROTECT MNANGAGWA\'S ASCENDANCY.  A POTENTIAL RIVAL, </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI--OFTEN TOUTED AS A </p><p>POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO MUGABE--WAS MADE THE PARTY\'S </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, UNDER THE </p><p>WATCHFUL EYE OF MNANGAGWA\'S FRIEND HOVE.  THE NEW </p><p>POLITBURO HAS BEEN SET UP TO SUPPORT MNANGAGWA AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7469 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07266  02 OF 02  281245Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------B06523  281246Z /38 </p><p>O 281245Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7897 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 007266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/28/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  07266  02 OF 02  281245Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW ZIMBABWE POLITBURO STRENGTHENS MNANGAGWA\'S </p><p>BID TO SUCCEED MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>SIDELINE HIS FOES, ACCORDING TO RAFTOPOULOS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RAFTOPOULOS TOLD US THAT HE ALSO SEES AN ETHNIC </p><p>DIMENSION TO THE POLITBURO APPOINTMENTS.  THE NDEBELE </p><p>AND MANICA--WHOSE HOME PROVINCES ARE DOMINATED BY THE </p><p>MDC--ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPPOSITION, AND ZANU-PF </p><p>MEMBERS FROM THOSE AREAS ARE MORE OFTEN SUSPECTED OF </p><p>HARBORING SYMPATHIES FOR THE OPPOSITION.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>THE NDEBELE OR MANICA NO LONGER RETAIN INDEPENDENT POWER </p><p>BASES IN ZANU-PF, AND THE NEW POLITBURO REFLECTS THAT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO RAFTOPOULOS.  NONE OF THE NEW POLITBURO </p><p>DEPARTMENT HEADS HAIL FROM MATABELELAND OR MANICALAND, </p><p>TO OUR KNOWLEDGE.  THE DEPARTURE OF ZVOBGO WEAKENS HIS </p><p>POSITION IN KALANGA-DOMINATED MASVINGO, WHERE ZANU-PF </p><p>AND THE MDC ARE BATTLING FOR INFLUENCE.  ZANU-PF IS </p><p>TRYING TO THWART A POSSIBLE NDEBELE-KALANGA ALLIANCE LED </p><p>BY ZVOBGO, WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO DILUTE THE ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S AUTHORITY IN MASVINGO, RAFTOPOULOS STATED. </p><p>ZANU-PF IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH ITS OWN "POWER AXIS" </p><p>BETWEEN THE ZEZURU OF MASHONALAND AND THE KALANGA OF </p><p>MASVINGO BY SIDELINING ZVOBGO AND INSTALLING PARTY </p><p>LEADERS LOYAL TO HARARE IN MASVINGO, ACCORDING TO </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: MUGABE\'S NEW POLITBURO NOT ONLY </p><p>CONSOLIDATES HIS OWN POSITION IN ZANU-PF, IT APPEARS TO </p><p>PUT MNANGAGWA NEAR THE APEX OF PARTY POWER.  IF MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07266  02 OF 02  281245Z </p><p>IS INDEED THINKING OF STEPPING DOWN A YEAR OR TWO AFTER </p><p>WINNING ONE MORE TERM, AS A NUMBER OF INTERLOCUTORS HAVE </p><p>TOLD US, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO BEGIN PREPARING A </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  MNANGAGWA IS A LONG-TIME AND CLOSE ALLY OF </p><p>MUGABE AND HAS THE FULL CONFIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT. </p><p>THE SPEAKER\'S FEARED REPUTATION AS AN "ENFORCER" WOULD </p><p>SERVE MUGABE\'S DESIRE TO HOLD ZANU-PF TOGETHER AND </p><p>DEFEAT THE MDC USING ANY MEANS NECESSARY.  IF HE BECAME </p><p>PRESIDENT, MNANGAGWA COULD TURN OUT TO BE JUST AS </p><p>DICTATORIAL AS MUGABE; RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES HE WOULD BE </p><p>EVEN MORE RUTHLESS THAN MUGABE.  IT IS STILL FAR TOO </p><p>EARLY TO TELL WHETHER MNANGAGWA IS THE ACTUAL HEIR </p><p>APPARENT, BUT RECENT EVENTS MAKE HIM THE EARLY FAVORITE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
