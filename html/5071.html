<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ADANA 0007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>JANUARY 9, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 9, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2.  SEVENTY-FIVE DIE IN PLANE CRASH IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(All papers)  An RJ 100-type plane that left </p><p>Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. for Diyarbakir with 75 </p><p>passengers and five crew members aboard crashed </p><p>near a military zone five kilometers away from the </p><p>Diyarbakir Airport at 8:15 p.m. on the same day. </p><p>Seventy-five people, including six foreigners, </p><p>three babies, two pilots and three crew members, </p><p>died, while five people thrown out at the time of </p><p>the crash escaped the crash with injuries.  (Note: </p><p>One Amcit was among the dead.  Ankara reporting </p><p>septel.)  After the crash, which was attributed to </p><p>"intense fog", soldiers encircled the crash site. </p><p>After falling, the plane fell apart, followed by </p><p>explosions.  Bodies are reported to be in an </p><p>unrecognizable state due to burns.  Experts pointed </p><p>to the lack of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) </p><p>at the airport.  This system cannot be installed at </p><p>the airport, as Diyarbakir is a military area. </p><p>There were no flights to Diyarbakir for the past </p><p>week due to fog.  Transportation Minister Binai </p><p>Yildirim left for Diyarbakir, taking corpse bags </p><p>with him.  Regarding the crash, Prime Minister </p><p>Abdullah Gul said there was not the possibility of </p><p>terror.  "Most probably, the weather conditions had </p><p>an effect," he added.  Hurrriyet reported a DNA </p><p>test will be conducted unless relatives recognize </p><p>the victims.  Bodies of identified victims will be </p><p>handed over to their families. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  CRITICISM OF POSSIBLE U.S. OPERATION IN VARIOUS </p><p>AREAS OF THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>Evrensel reported increased criticism of the </p><p>possible U.S. operation against Iraq in Gaziantep </p><p>and Adana, the two provinces that were mostly </p><p>affected during the 1991 Gulf Crisis.  The </p><p>Gaziantep Labor Platform decided to stage an anti- </p><p>war rally to protest U.S. war preparations and the </p><p>(Turkish) government\'s attitude toward this war. </p><p>In Adana, Belma Cingillioglu of the Labor Party </p><p>(EMEP) held a press conference in front of the EMEP </p><p>office in which she said 90% of the public wanted </p><p>Incirlik (Adana) Air Base and other bases closed. </p><p>Human Rights Association (HRA) and Public Training </p><p>Center (Halkevi) officials supported the press </p><p>conference.  Local journalists in Mersin, whose </p><p>port might be used during such an operation, said </p><p>they do not want to publish news articles on the </p><p>destruction to be caused by this Iraq war.  Mersin </p><p>Chamber of Commerce and Industry Acting President </p><p>Serdal Kuyucuoglu warned that the province\'s </p><p>economy would never be able to recover if its port </p><p>were used in such a war.  Hurriyet reported that </p><p>the representatives of 15 Mersin professional </p><p>associations, all affiliated with the Turkish Union </p><p>of Architects and Engineers Chambers (TMMOB), </p><p>issued a declaration saying they do not want war. </p><p>Sabah reported that attorneys from bar associations </p><p>throughout Turkey issued an anti-war declaration </p><p>saying that "Turkey has neither a single child nor </p><p>a penny to sacrifice for oil and arms monopolies". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  BATMAN ANTI-WAR RALLY SET FOR JANUARY 19 </p><p>(Evrensel)  In a January 7 press conference, the </p><p>Batman Peace Platform announced it would start </p><p>anti-war activities through a rally on January 19. </p><p>Nearly 500 people attended the press conference, </p><p>which was supported by democratic mass </p><p>organizations and labor unions.  Sadi Ozdemir, </p><p>President of the Batman chapter of the Human Rights </p><p>Association (HRA), said Turkey\'s involvement in a </p><p>possible war in Iraq would bring nothing but </p><p>hunger, poverty and tears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  BLACKOUT INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO GAS STATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Turkish Petroleum Refineries </p><p>Corporation\'s (TUPRAS) Batman Refinery has given </p><p>blackout instructions to all gas stations along the </p><p>Iraqi border in order to protect the pipeline </p><p>carrying Iraqi oil.  The paper points to increased </p><p>activity across the Southeast as preparations </p><p>continue toward a possible U.S. war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  ADANA AIRPORT WILL RESUME OPERATION </p><p>(Bolge)  The State Airports Administration (DHMI) </p><p>senior director, Cengiz Asikli, stressed that the </p><p>Adana Airport would re-open to flights beginning on </p><p>January 15, despite a delay in the completion of </p><p>its repair and maintenance project due to weather </p><p>conditions.  The airport was closed to flights on </p><p>November 4 for repair and maintenance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  YSK PRESIDENT CRITICIZES KANADOGLU FOR HIS </p><p>STATEMENT </p><p>(Hurriyet/Sabah/Cumhuriyet)  In an answer to a </p><p>journalist\'s question regarding Supreme Court Chief </p><p>Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu\'s statement that AK </p><p>Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan could not run in </p><p>the Siirt elections, Tufan Algan, President of the </p><p>Higher Election Council (YSK), reacted negatively. </p><p>"If the president of every institution goes out and </p><p>expresses his opinion, this will only disrupt the </p><p>State and confuse heads," he said.  Algan first </p><p>characterized Kanadoglu\'s statement as "his </p><p>political thought" and then as "his own opinion". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  ALLEGATIONS THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY PRACTICES </p><p>CONTINUE </p><p>(Sabah/Cumhuriyet)  On January 8, NGO\'s from </p><p>Southeastern Turkey briefed the Parliamentary Human </p><p>Rights Commission, which is preparing to travel to </p><p>inspect the situation in the Southeast after the </p><p>State of Emergency\'s (OHAL) abolition.  "Current </p><p>problems still continue despite partial </p><p>improvements following the lifting of OHAL," they </p><p>claimed.  Fusun Sayek of the Turkish Physicians </p><p>Chamber (TTB) said, "Health services in the region </p><p>are far from the humanitarian level", while the </p><p>Association for the Oppressed (MAZLUM-DER) national </p><p>president, Yilmaz Ensaroglu, claimed there were no </p><p>changes in such issues as the village guard system, </p><p>the Village Return Project, and (use of) Kurdish </p><p>names.  Human Rights Association (HRA) Vice </p><p>National President Yusuf Alatas noted that public </p><p>officials viewed OHAL as normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTEST </p><p>(Bolge)  The Adana chapter of the Egitim-Sen </p><p>teachers union staged a January 7 march from the </p><p>city hall to the AK Party provincial office to </p><p>protest the Government\'s decision to repay </p><p>employees for mandatory payroll deductions only on </p><p>a long-term basis.  Protestors shouted anti- </p><p>government slogans despite police warnings.  State </p><p>Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK)-affiliated </p><p>labor unions and such political parties as the </p><p>Republican People\'s Party (CHP), the Freedom and </p><p>Solidarity Party (ODP) and the Labor Party (EMEP) </p><p>gave support by participating in the march.  The </p><p>Egitim-Sen Adana organization issued a press </p><p>release claiming that, during the march, some </p><p>security units had threatened to arrest and "exile" </p><p>(i.e., "transfer") the chapter president.  The </p><p>organization condemned what it called "verbal </p><p>assault". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  HIZBULLAH AND KADEK (PKK) SUSPECTS HELD </p><p>(Turkiye/Milli Gazete/Cumhuriyet/Evrensel) </p><p>Diyarbakir police arrested a total of 19 suspects </p><p>during an anti-Hizbullah and anti-KADEK (PKK) </p><p>operation on January 8.  The arrestees included ten </p><p>Hizbullah suspects accused of "political </p><p>organizing, fund-raising activities, and </p><p>extortion", as well as nine people suspected of </p><p>"logistical support and recruitment for KADEK". </p><p>Following interrogation, the arrestees were </p><p>arraigned in a local court where six Hizbullah and </p><p>six KADEK suspects were ordered to remain in </p><p>custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.

COLLEGE STUDENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Mustafa Kemal University (Hatay) </p><p>Rector\'s Office launched an investigation against </p><p>eight students who issued a mid-December press </p><p>release to support the "I Want My University </p><p>Initiative" started by Dicle University </p><p>(Diyarbakir) students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  DIYARBAKIR CHURCH ROBBED </p><p>(Turkiye)  Unidentified persons broke into the </p><p>1,700-year-old Meryem Ana Syriac Christian Church </p><p>in Diyarbakir on January 8, stealing three 300- </p><p>year-old silver-plated crosses and a painting of </p><p>the Virgin Mary).
