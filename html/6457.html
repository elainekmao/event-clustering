<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TU, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>MARCH 17, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March </p><p>17, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press reports </p><p>often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Hurriyet/Sabah/Milliyet/Radikal/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Turkiye/Tercuman: The PUK Leader Celal </p><p>Talabani, the Leader of Turkoman Front Sanan </p><p>Ahmed Aga, and IKDP Representative Necirvan </p><p>Barzani came to Ankara. The leaders of the Iraqi </p><p>Opposition crossed into Turkey from Habur Border </p><p>Gate yesterday and flew from Diyarbakir to Ankara </p><p>where they were met by their party </p><p>representatives in Turkey. In response to </p><p>reporter\'s questions, Celal Talabani said they </p><p>were going to talk about matters that concern </p><p>their Turkish brothers and American friends. </p><p>Sanan Ahmet Aga also drew attention to the </p><p>importance of the Opposition Group\'s meeting </p><p>tomorrow, saying it would be a turning point for </p><p>the future of the Turkomen, and the policy Turkey </p><p>would follow in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Hurriyet: An anonymous U.S. official told AP </p><p>News Agency that the U.S. has put into effect war </p><p>plans excluding Turkey, and that the primary </p><p>focus of the contacts Zalmay Halilzad has been </p><p>having in Ankara is to persuade Turkey about not </p><p>deploying soldiers in Northern Iraq. The </p><p>anonymous US official claimed Turkey\'s unilateral </p><p>penetration into northern Iraq would cause </p><p>clashes and problems with the coalition forces, </p><p>and expressed his concern that, if Turkey entered </p><p>northern Iraq without the coalition forces, </p><p>clashes might even take place between  Turkish </p><p>and U.S. military units. The same source said the </p><p>USD 15 billion-dollar grant and loan package had </p><p>been withdrawn.  It was not sure if the package </p><p>would be re-discussed, even if the motion passed </p><p>from the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Hurriyet/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Evrensel/Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: Freighters </p><p>have discharged Patriot missiles, Stinger missile </p><p>batteries, Hummer jeeps, vehicles including </p><p>military trucks, and military equipment in 211 </p><p>containers at the port of Iskenderun since </p><p>February 19. Because Turkey did not grant </p><p>permission for foreign soldiers to be deployed in </p><p>or transit through Turkey, 36 ships carrying the </p><p>United States\' Fourth Infantry Brigade\'s tanks, </p><p>armored vehicles, and ammunitions still wait off </p><p>shore in the Mediterranean. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Hurriyet: On the 15th anniversary of Saddam\'s </p><p>use of chemical gas which killed 5 thousand </p><p>people instantly in Halepce town of Northern </p><p>Iraq, demonstrators from Istanbul\'s DEHAP Youth </p><p>Organization, Socialist Democratic Party, The New </p><p>Democrat Youth, No to War in Iraq Committee and </p><p>other non-governmental organizations posted </p><p>banners, and shouted slogans in Turkish and </p><p>Kurdish. When DEHAP demonstrators started </p><p>shouting pro-KADEK and pro-Ocalan slogans, anti- </p><p>riot police arrested 26 persons, including two </p><p>women. In Diyarbakir, Democracy Platform members </p><p>who wanted to make a press announcement in front </p><p>of the Human Rights Monument were not allowed </p><p>into the park by police. As a consequence, the </p><p>police arrested 10 demonstrators for undertaking </p><p>an "illegal demonstration." </p><p>6. Milliyet: Dozens of animals died in Doyuran </p><p>village of Kiziltepe at the Syrian border 20 days </p><p>ago. The villagers are suspicious of the </p><p>Americans who visited their village two weeks </p><p>ago. Doyuran villagers said the chickens died </p><p>first, and then about 50 head of cattle perished </p><p>in the past 10 days. Sheep, calves, and birds in </p><p>the region have also become the victims of </p><p>mysterious death.  The villagers said some </p><p>foreigners visited their village in two black US </p><p>jeeps two weeks ago.  One of the villagers, Ahmet </p><p>Sahin, said he lost all his chickens and about 20 </p><p>sheep, and that an equal number of sheep were </p><p>also sick. The village headman, Osman Kilic, said </p><p>his sheep also had died. Kiziltepe sub-governor, </p><p>Tayyar Sasmaz, said there was no epidemic disease </p><p>in the region but would assign officials from </p><p>Provincial Agricultural Directorate and Health </p><p>Committee to investigate the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet: In response to TGS\'s demand to </p><p>initiate State of Extraordinary Rule in six </p><p>provinces should the war start, Interior Minister </p><p>Abdulkadir Aksu said no weakness had been seen in </p><p>their combat with terrorism since OHAL was ended. </p><p>During parliamentary debates about his ministry\'s </p><p>budget, Minister Aksu said the region was </p><p>normalized following the lifting of the OHAL and </p><p>thus gave an indirect answer to TGS\'s desire to </p><p>declare OHAL in Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, </p><p>Siirt, Batman, and Hakkari provinces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Evrensel: Anadolu New Agency reported that </p><p>the Chief Public Prosecutor investigating </p><p>Kahramanmaras DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman Metin </p><p>Gonulsen prepared an indictment accusing him of </p><p>"threatening the country with civil war" and </p><p>"making propaganda for a terror organization." </p><p>Based on the prosecutor\'s instructions, Mr. </p><p>Gonulsen was apprehended and ordered held by </p><p>court. After his arrest, anti-terror teams </p><p>obtained a court warrant, and subsequently </p><p>searched DEHAP\'s provincial and district offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Evrensel: Newroz Organization Committee of </p><p>Mersin applied to the governor\'s office for </p><p>permission to celebrate the "Newroz" (new year </p><p>celebrations) in Mersin. Two persons were killed </p><p>during the celebrations last year. Regarding the </p><p>issue, the Provincial Administrator, Ilhan Tas, </p><p>said their application was accepted.  Tas said </p><p>the chances for celebrating the Newroz this year </p><p>were high, and that the committee would request </p><p>an appointment from the governor and the security </p><p>director on March 17.  Adiyaman Democracy </p><p>Platform also applied to the governor\'s office to </p><p>celebrate the Newroz.  Committees have been </p><p>formed for the celebration of Newroz in Hakkari. </p><p>A local singer, Nevzat Alter, is reported to </p><p>participate the March 21 celebrations in Hakkari. </p><p>In Adana, the Labor, Peace and Democracy Block </p><p>applied to the governor\'s office for Newroz </p><p>celebrations. DEHAP Central Committee Members who </p><p>applied to the governor\'s office said they would </p><p>celebrate the Newroz at three separate locations </p><p>and was expecting 150,000 participants at </p><p>celebrations in Adana and 20,000 in Ceyhan. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
