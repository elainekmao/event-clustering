<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000385 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND EB </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, PREL, NI, OPEC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA PROPOSES NEW OPEC QUOTA SCHEME </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Special Assistant on Petroleum Issues </p><p>Kupolokun told the Ambassador on February 14 that Nigeria had </p><p>made a thinly-veiled threat to withdraw from OPEC while </p><p>proposing to other members a new quota allocation scheme </p><p>based on production capacity and socioeconomic indicators </p><p>rather than reserves. Kupolokun enlisted U.S. support for the </p><p>Nigerian position, but the Ambassador indicated we were </p><p>unlikely to put diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia or other </p><p>Gulf countries at this time. He did suggest, however, that </p><p>Kupolokun visit Washington soon to discuss energy issues. </p><p>Paragraph 9 is an Action Request. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a February 14 meeting with the Ambassador at the </p><p>ChevronTexaco Managing Director\'s Abuja residence, Special </p><p>Assistant to the President on Petroleum Issues Funsho </p><p>Kupolokun said Nigeria had proposed to OPEC members the </p><p>preceding week in Vienna a new quota allocation scheme based </p><p>on production capacity and socioeconomic indicators rather </p><p>than reserves. Also present at the meeting with Kupolokun was </p><p>ChevronTexaco Managing Director Jay Pryor. Lagos CG </p><p>Hinson-Jones and Econoff (notetaker) were also there. The </p><p>Nigerian proposal argued that adherence to the current system </p><p>would cripple the Nigerian oil sector and, because that one </p><p>sector is so dominant, have a devastating impact on the </p><p>Nigerian economy at-large. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kupolokun predicted that Nigerian production capacity </p><p>will grow quickly over the next few years as deepwater fields </p><p>go into production. He said that in 2003 Nigerian production </p><p>capacity will be about 3.1 million barrels per day (mbd), </p><p>while the OPEC quota will be only 2 mbd. Kupolokun forecasted </p><p>that by 2006 Nigerian production capacity will rise to 4.7 </p><p>mbd, with a quota of only 2.3 million if the current system </p><p>remains intact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kupolokun said several factors contributed to the </p><p>increase in Nigerian production capacity, key among them the </p><p>recent infusion of capital into the sector by the government </p><p>to meet joint venture cash-call arrears that had gone unpaid </p><p>for much of the 1990\'s. Pryor added that most of that </p><p>investment has gone into deepwater fields that yield light </p><p>crude that is easier to refine into gasoline than onshore </p><p>Bonny crude. U.S. demand for this non-Arab source of crude </p><p>that can be cheaply refined into gasoline has also pushed </p><p>investment in Nigerian deepwater fields, according to Pryor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Kupolokun acknowledged that maintaining spare capacity </p><p>is key to OPEC\'s ability to keep world oil prices stable, but </p><p>said that Nigeria\'s burden in doing so is too high. He said </p><p>that by 2006 if the OPEC quota system is not changed, </p><p>Nigerian spare capacity as a percentage of total capacity </p><p>will be more than 100 percent, while spare capacity for Arab </p><p>OPEC members will be around 25 to 50 percent. Pryor added </p><p>that to be economically viable, deepwater fields must run at </p><p>close to full capacity, unlike the large onshore fields being </p><p>pumped by most other OPEC members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kupolokun also made the case that from a socioeconomic </p><p>perspective, Nigeria would find it difficult to keep a lid on </p><p>production. He compared Nigeria to other OPEC countries on a </p><p>series of socioeconomic indicators, summing up the situation </p><p>as follows: "If it is good, like income, we are last, if it </p><p>is bad, like infant mortality, we are first." He said the GON </p><p>is finding it harder and harder to explain to its people why </p><p>it is forsaking additional oil revenues for the benefit of </p><p>rich Arab nations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Commenting that these two points comprised a </p><p>thinly-veiled threat to withdraw from OPEC, Kupolokun went on </p><p>to outline the Nigerian proposal that the OPEC quota </p><p>allocation system be modified to include production capacity </p><p>as well as account for economic development indicators such </p><p>as GDP per capita and external debt. To ensure that no member </p><p>would face a drop in quota, the Nigerian proposal would allow </p><p>some proportion of the new quota to be based on the old </p><p>system, with the balance based on production capacity and </p><p>those key indicators. Kupolokun reports that Nigeria\'s </p><p>proposal split OPEC members between Gulf and non-Gulf </p><p>countries, with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar </p><p>staunchly opposed and Algeria and Libya enthusiastically </p><p>supportive. Kupolokun indicated that a final decision on the </p><p>Nigerian proposal, as well as a similar proposal made by an </p><p>independent consultant, would be made at the mid-March OPEC </p><p>Council of Ministers Meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Kupolokun asked the Ambassador whether the United </p><p>States might be able to provide diplomatic support for </p><p>Nigeria\'s efforts to win over other OPEC members on their </p><p>quota allocation proposal. The Ambassador expressed sympathy </p><p>for the Nigerian position, but noted that given the current </p><p>state of the world, the United States was unlikely to press </p><p>Saudi Arabia or other Gulf states on an issue as contentious </p><p>as this. He did, however suggest that Kupolokun visit the </p><p>United States soon to have a full discussion on energy issues </p><p>with Washington-based officials interested and dealing with </p><p>energy security issues. Kupolokun indicated interest in the </p><p>idea but said he would consult with his colleagues before </p><p>making a commitment. In a recent chance meeting, Kupolokun </p><p>told the Ambassador the GON is very interested in the idea of </p><p>visiting Washington, but would not want to do so before the </p><p>April National Elections. Kupolokun promised to formalize the </p><p>request in writing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Action Request: Post requests Washington input on the </p><p>feasibility of a Washington visit by Kupolokun following the </p><p>April Nigerian National Elections. End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: The proposal to increase Nigeria\'s quota is </p><p>strongly backed by ChevronTexaco here in Nigeria. It will </p><p>almost certainly be supported by other oil companies </p><p>operating in Nigeria, including Exxon-Mobil. Although the </p><p>humanitarian benefits to Nigerians of a quota increase were </p><p>stressed in the meeting, the other major factor is more money </p><p>for the oil companies and the GON. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
