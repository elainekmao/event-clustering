<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Mission team journeys through LTTE controlled </p><p>territory; Tamil Eelam still touted in the Vanni </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified, </p><p>please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SUMMARY:  Mission team successfully concluded its </p><p>first journey through the Tiger controlled north since </p><p>opening of the A-9 road in April 2002.  Although the </p><p>trip was uneventful in terms of LTTE actions, travelling </p><p>on the ill-kept A-9 was arduous.  The presence of LTTE </p><p>cadre, predominantly women, was clearly visible along </p><p>the entire route.  Villages in the Tiger controlled </p><p>areas appeared lively and colorful.  Despite these </p><p>observations, the majority of the trip was through vast </p><p>tracks of unused land.  The A-9 is an example of the </p><p>government and LTTE cooperating to make travelling as </p><p>easy as possible.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mission team successfully traversed Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) controlled territory in </p><p>northern Sri Lanka to reach the Jaffna Peninsula on </p><p>November 25 and returned the next day in another </p><p>uneventful journey.  This was the first time since the </p><p>A-9 road reopened on April 8 that representatives from </p><p>the U.S. Mission used the road.  The last time an </p><p>American from the U.S. Mission used that portion of the </p><p>road in the Vanni, the area of northern Sri Lanka </p><p>controlled by the LTTE, was in 1987. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Although the Mission team was quickly cleared </p><p>through all checkpoints and had no interaction with LTTE </p><p>cadre, the trip itself was arduous due to the poor </p><p>condition of the road.  The road varied in quality from </p><p>short stretches that were smooth and wide enough for </p><p>two-way traffic to areas that were washed out with the </p><p>tarmac that was once in place barely recognizable.  One </p><p>small section was flooded.  Despite all of the problems, </p><p>the road was useable.  It took just over three hours to </p><p>travel through approximately 94 kilometers (58 miles) </p><p>controlled by the LTTE.  According to government </p><p>estimates, there is an average of 3000 people travelling </p><p>the same route each day.  Some low-tech and labor </p><p>intensive repair work of the road is ongoing, but it is </p><p>unclear if repairs can keep pace with the use. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Mission team noted the ubiquitousness of women </p><p>LTTE cadre along the stretch of the A-9 in LTTE </p><p>controlled areas.  The checkpoints into and out of the </p><p>Vanni were controlled by LTTE police (men and women) and </p><p>women LTTE cadre.  Except for certain women cadre (those </p><p>in black or dark green uniforms), which had automatic </p><p>weapons, the LTTE representatives tended not to be as </p><p>heavily armed as the military at the government </p><p>checkpoints. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) One additional sign of the complete control, </p><p>which the LTTE exercises in the Vanni is that they </p><p>register and issue license plates for the vehicles </p><p>operating in their area.  Some drivers change the </p><p>appropriate license plates on their trucks or busses </p><p>between the government and LTTE checkpoints.  The LTTE </p><p>license plates all began with the Tamil letter "thaana," </p><p>which is often seen as signifying "Tamil Eelam."  Signs </p><p>alongside the road also referred to Tamil Eelam.  One </p><p>map went so far as to indicate that Tamil Eelam </p><p>stretched from south of Puttalam on the west coast </p><p>around to Yala National Park on the southeast coast and </p><p>significant portions inland.  This map showed "Tamil </p><p>Eelam" covering at least two-thirds of the coast and in </p><p>excess of a third of Sri Lanka in general.  The martyrs\' </p><p>day posters, the Tamil Eelam maps, and the recruitment </p><p>posters all point to an attachment to the notion of </p><p>"Tamil Eelam." </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The villages along the A-9 were colorful and </p><p>lively.  The stores appeared full and people seemed </p><p>busy.  Just off the main road and outside the village </p><p>centers, however, the destruction wrought by previous </p><p>military campaigns was visible.  Driving into the LTTE </p><p>controlled territory the roadside became noticeably </p><p>cleaner than in government-controlled areas.  NGO </p><p>representatives in Jaffna commented positively on the </p><p>government\'s easing of restrictions on transport of </p><p>goods into LTTE areas.  Their comments seemed to be </p><p>verified by the amount of basic consumer goods available </p><p>in roadside stores.  The work of international </p><p>organizations is also clearly seen along the A-9. UNHCR </p><p>material, UNICEF mine awareness signs, and ICRC stations </p><p>were all prominent in the Vanni. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT:  The most striking aspect of the </p><p>journey was the ease with which Mission personnel were </p><p>able to conduct the trip.  The government and the LTTE </p><p>have worked out the difficulties they had in April and </p><p>May re access to the A-9.  Government officials, NGOs, </p><p>INGOs, and IOs working in the area reportedly have IDs </p><p>that permit them to travel without taxation or undue </p><p>hassle at the LTTE or military checkpoints.  In </p><p>addition, there are provisions for diplomats to travel </p><p>through the region.  Mission still has some concerns </p><p>with the safety of the road and how any vehicle </p><p>difficulties would be dealt with, but for now the A-9 </p><p>appears to be a viable option in travelling to Jaffna. </p><p>(Note:  The RSO intends to travel the A-9 in the near </p><p>future to review in detail security issues.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
